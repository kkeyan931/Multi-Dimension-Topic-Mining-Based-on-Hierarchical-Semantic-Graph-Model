abstract

the equivalence between the chern-simons gauge theory on a three-
dimensional manifold with boundary and the wznw model on the bound-
ary is established in a simple and general way using the brst symmetry.
our approach is based on restoring gauge invariance of the chern-simons
theory in the presence of a boundary. this gives a correspondence to the
wznw model that does not require solving any constraints, xing the
gauge or specifying boundary conditions.

in a seminal paper [1] on the 2+1 dimensional yang-mills theory with an action
consisting purely of a chern-simons term (chern-simons gauge theory), witten
showed that the chern-simons theory on a compact surface was intimately connected
with two-dimensional conformal eld theory and more precisely to wznw models
with compact groups. the connection was stated in the somewhat abstract form
that the physical hilbert spaces obtained by quantization in 2+1 dimensions can be
interpreted as the spaces of conformal blocks in 1+1 dimensions. a more concrete
connection was also suggested by considering the chern-simons theory on a manifold
with boundary. this connection was further elaborated in [3] and [2], generalizing
the connection to gauged wznw models with compact groups.

although the treatment in [1]-[3] for a manifold with boundary is explicit it is
not entirely satisfactory for several reasons. firstly, the action on a manifold with
boundary is not gauge invariant. a gauge transformation yields boundary terms.
this implies that upon quantization there is no symmetry that restricts possible
quantum corrections. however, the fact that the gauge invariance is broken at the
boundary is precisely what is used in [2], [3] to show that chern-simons action
reduces to a chiral wznw action in a particular partial gauge. thus, it seems
that connection between the chern-simons theory and the wznw model can only
be made if gauge invariance is broken at the boundary and for a particular partial
gauge. related to this is the fact that in making the connection to the wznw model
one does not encounter the standard chiral wznw hamiltonian, but in fact one that
is zero [2]. this is a consequence of the way the connection is made by solving the
constraints. it really means that we still have an action not suitable for quantization
since it is still not gauge xed.

secondly, as there is no gauge invariance on the boundary, one may even clas-
sically modify the chern-simons action with boundary terms. dierent boundary
terms will yield dierent boundary actions and dierent actions for the conformal
eld theory. an argument due to regge and teitelboim [4] may be invoked as a
guiding principle for possible boundary terms. for our particular example this is
done in [5]. notice however that the situation in [4] is quite dierent from ours and
we will see that in treating our model we use a completely dierent principle.

these objections to the explicit correspondence should be contrasted to the gen-
eral connection involving the hilbert space of the 2+1 dimensional theory and con-
formal blocks mentioned above. although formulated for the case of a compact
manifold without boundary and for a compact group, it does not refer to any par-
ticular gauge or any particular choice of boundary condition. it is natural to ask

1

whether or not a more explicit formulation exists, which still is general with no ref-
erence to a particular gauge or choice of boundary condition. some progress towards
such a formulation have been achieved see e.g. [9], [10], but as far as we know there
is no formulation which gives the connection between the cs and wznw theories in
a completely general and gauge invariant way and at the level of actions, and which
does not depend on any particular boundary conditions. the objective of the present
work is to provide such a formulation.

we will see that the correspondence may be formulated in terms of a brst
symmetry.
invariance with respect to the brst transformations will imply that
the two theories - chern-simons and wznw - are equivalent. particular forms
of the action may then be found by dierent choices of the brst invariant gauge
xing terms. the crucial step in our approach is to restore gauge invariance of the cs
theory in the presence of a boundary. this will be achieved by adding new dynamical
degrees of freedom at the boundary, namely the wznw degrees of freedom. in spirit,
our approach is similar to that of dirac [6], where he advocated the introduction of
new degrees of freedom describing the initial quantization surface and corresponding
constraints to make the theory reparametrization invariant (see also [4]). an even
closer resemblence is to the work on surface terms for yang-mills theories [7],[8] in
connection with non-abelian monopole solutions.

an important outcome of our treatment is that the action is completely xed
up to brst exact terms.
it is no longer possible to add boundary terms to the
action without spoiling the brst symmetry (with the exception of non-trivial brst
invariant terms, if they exist). thus the apparent arbitrariness of adding boundary
terms in the original formulation of the cs theory (which however can be partially
reduced by appropriate boundary conditions) has been completely eliminated.

the use of the brst symmetry in connection with the cs theory rst appeared
in [11]. their treatment is, however, quite dierent from ours as gauge invariance
is not restored (it uses a particular gauge and no new dynamical degrees of freedom
are introduced at the boundary) and certain boundary conditions are assumed. also
the connection to the cs theory is not achieved on the level of actions.

recently, the interest in the chern-simons theory has grown substantially due to
the work of maldacena [12] on the correspondence between string theory on anti-de
sitter spaces and certain conformally invariant theories associated with the boundary.
this correspondence was formulated as the so-called holographic principle [15],[16]
(ideas originally presented in [13], [14]). as our work here deals with a special (and
simple) case of the holographic principle it may be of some interest that there exists

2

a simple and elegant way to implement this principle. however, due to the simplicity
of the model with no propagating degrees of freedom in the bulk, it is not clear that
this may be of use for a more non-trivial example.

the motivation of our work does not primarily come from ads/cft correspon-
dence in itself, but rather from our desire to understand the calculations of the
entropy of the 2+1 dimensional black hole presented in [17] (see also [18]). in partic-
ular, we wanted to understand the problem of choice of boundary terms in connection
with the btz [19] black hole. our results in connection with this problem will be
presented elsewhere [20].

we start by briey recalling the correspondence between chern-simons theory
on a manifold with boundary and wznw models as formulated in [1]-[3]. the
chern-simons action is

ics = 

k

2 zr

t r(a  da +

2
3

a  a  a).

(1)

the action is invariant under the gauge transformation a = d + [a, ] if  has no
boundary. if  has a boundary the variation yields a boundary term

ics = 

k

2 zr

t r(da).

(2)

the invariance of the action may be achieved by requiring  = 0 on the boundary.
this is equivalent to saying that the full gauge group g is reduced to all gauge
transformations g1, that are one on the boundary. the variation of a0 yields a
constraint (i, j = 1, 2)

ijfaij  0, a = 1, . . . n.

(3)

this constraint implies that the vector eld is pure gauge i.e. ai = iu u 1, for
some map u :   g. the gauge invariance implies that we have an equivalence
relation u  v u for any v that is one on the boundary. this implies that only the
restriction of u to the boundary is relevant. if we use ai = iu u 1, i = 1, 2, and
x the gauge partially by a0 = 0, the chern-simons action reduces to

ics = 

k

2 (cid:18)zr

t r(u 1u u 1tu +

1

3 zr

t r(u 1du u 1du u 1du )(cid:19) . (4)

here we have chosen  = d, a disc of radius r with a radial coordinate x1 = r
and an angular coordinate x2 = . we will for convenience make this choice for the
remaining part of the paper. as remarked above, the hamiltonian corresponding
to this action is easily checked to be zero. furthermore, the action corresponds

3

to a chiral wznw action, where the current j(z) in the conventional form of the
wznw theory here is identied with a = u u 1, as can be seen from the
form of the action (4). the dirac brackets of these currents give that the current
satises an ane lie algebra of level k [21]. if we add to the action boundary terms
e.g. a term  k
again ai = iu u 1 leads to modications of (4) by boundary terms, which in turn
implies that the resulting action is not the conventional chiral wznw action. a
boundary term of this form (for a particular c ) was e.g. suggested in [17] for the
btz black hole.

(7)

as the appearance of the boundary terms involving the delta function (x1  r) may
seem surprising and is important in what follows, we will explain the calculation in
a little more detail. in computing the pb one needs to use certain delta-function
identities. these identities may be derived using test functions, that are usually
assumed to be zero on the boundary. then the constraint algebra may be shown to
close. the extra terms on the right hand side of eq.(7) appear if one generalizes the
delta-function identities to hold on test functions that are arbitrary on the boundary3.
the breakdown of a rst class algebra due to a boundary was noted previously in
[8] for yang-mills theory, in [22] for gravity in the ashtekar formalism, and in [10]

3the practical way of making all computations here and below is in fact to use  =

rd d2x(a(x)a(x)) for some l1 functions on d and compute {,  }. an alternative way of

computing the pb is to introduce a complete set of functions on d and then by using the pb of the
modes with respect to this set, the pb can be computed yielding the same result.

4

for the present case. in [23] and [24] boundary corrections for poisson brackets in
general are discussed.

the appearance of the extra terms in eq.(7) implies that the constraints are
not rst class on the boundary i.e. gauge invariance is broken by boundary terms.
this is of course connected to the fact that the action is not gauge invariant due to
boundary contributions. it implies that a gauge may not be xed on all of d. the
breaking of gauge invariance occurs only at the boundary. if x, x are interior points,
then the extra terms in eq.(7) are zero and the constraints are rst class. further
implications of the breakdown of gauge invariance is that the time evolution of the
secondary constraints yields additional constraints.

in the careful computation of eq.(7) lies also the hint on how to proceed.

it
is well-known that second class constraints may be converted into rst class con-
straints by adding new degrees of freedom, whereby restoring the gauge symmetry
of the theory. this will be the strategy in the following. firstly one notices that

this hamiltonian is automatically gauge invariant even at the boundary. notice
that gauge invariance forces a modication of the chern-simons action by a unique
boundary term in the vector elds. let us pause and comment on the constraints
of the new theory. these are given by 
a  0. examining eq.(9) we see that these
constraints consist of two pieces, a bulk and a boundary part. the boundary part
enters much like a source term. for any point in the interior of d we simply have
the original constraints ijfaij  0. if we consider eld congurations ai
a that are
continuous and have continuos spatial derivatives at the boundary, then they will also
satisfy ijfaij  0 on d. in this case the constraint implies that aa2()   2

on d. thus, we recover the connection between wznw currents and aa
2 mentioned
above in the original formulation. for eld congurations that are not smooth at
the boundary this relation does not hold. it is not clear to us what the implications
of this generalization mean.

a simple counting of the degrees of freedom shows that the additional degrees of
freedom associated with the currents ja, which are n phase space degrees of freedom
at every space point on the boundary, compensate exactly that the n constraints are
transformed from second class to rst class constraints on the boundary. let us now
show in more detail that the theory dened by this hamiltonian is equivalent to the
chern-simons theory dened by the action (1) and a specic boundary term added
to it.

first we impose the partial gauge aa

it remains to show that we can break the gauge
resulting actions are identical.
invariance by imposing gauge xing constraints on the boundary that eliminate the
new degrees of freedom. we consider a gauge constraint ja()(x1  r)  0. to see
that this xes the gauge at the boundary consider its gauge variation with parameter

a(r, ).

(11)

a(r, ) = 0, from which we conclude that the
equating this to zero, we nd  
gauge is xed at the boundary apart from the zero mode part of 
a. neglecting this
detail for the moment, the gauge xing constraint eliminates the wznw current
a  0 to a  0, which are second class
degrees of freedom reducing the constraints 
on the boundary. thus we are back to the original chern-simons theory (with a
specic boundary term).

let us now comment on the zero mode part. the gauge xing of the zero mode

part, r dja()  0, is not a valid gauge choice. we may notice that in fact the

-independent part of the constraint generators 
a satisfy a closed algebra. thus,
we have really introduced slightly more degrees of freedom than necessary. this may
be changed by subtracting the zero mode of ja from 
a. then the -independent
part of aa
2 will play the role of the zero mode of the current. in the following we will
for simplicity not concern ourself with this subtlety and leave 

a unaltered.

we have already seen that our theory reduces to the chern-simons theory for
a particular choice of partial gauge. we will now show that for another choice of
gauge we may eliminate the vector eld degrees of freedom leaving us with only the
wznw degrees of freedom, thus establishing classically the equivalence of the two

6

0  aa

theories. imposing the gauge constraints aa
1  0, it is easily checked that this
xes the gauge both in the interior of d and at its boundary. this eliminates all
vector eld degrees of freedom (as aa
1). the dirac bracket is,
therefore, only non-zero for brackets containing the wznw degrees of freedom and,
therefore, we have found the promised reduction. possible forms for the hamiltonian
will be discussed below.

2 is conjugate to aa

we have established the connection between the chern-simons theory and the
chiral wznw model by imposing dierent gauges. a more fundamental way of
manifesting the equivalence is to introduce a brst charge. as the constraints are
rst class this is straightforward using the bfv formalism [25], [26]. we have

  rd d2x[ k

(12)

we note that the brst charge consists of two distinct parts. in the rst line we
have a bulk part and in the second a boundary part. the ghosts ca, ba and their
momenta ba, ca satisfy the usual pb. it is easily checked that {, } = 0. a brst
invariant hamiltonian may now be constructed in the standard way

for some gauge fermion . we will now discuss some possible choices of .

the rst term is precisely the sugawara hamiltonian (for an appropriate choice of
). the second term is a ghost correction at the boundary. the third term is a bulk
hamiltonian. since the degrees of freedom are completely eliminated in the bulk,
this term will not contribute to any dirac brackets. in fact, we may set this term to
zero and still have a brst invariant hamiltonian.

other choices of gauge fermions are of course possible e.g. one which makes the
0 dynamical. we will, however, not discuss this further.

instead let us end with some concluding remarks.

we have demonstrated the classical equivalence between the chern-simons gauge
theory and the chiral wznw model. it should be emphasized that the equivalence
between the bulk and boundary theories follows without any specications of gauge
or boundary conditions.
it is the gauge invariance or more generally the brst
invariance that makes the dierent choices of hamiltonian physically equivalent.
the quantum equivalence is ensured once the nilpotency of the brst operator is
established and non-trivial brst invariant states are found. thus, for this particular
example one may state that the holographic principle is translated into a statement
about brst symmetry.

our considerations have for simplicity been for the disc, but they may easily be
generalized to other cases. then the delta function (x1  r) is replaced by a gener-

alized delta function (x  ), which is dened by r[f (x)(x  )] = r f (x).

note also that it is irrelevant where the boundary actually is i.e. we have the freedom
to move it at will. this is a freedom that follows from our formulation as it does
not rely on any particular boundary conditions. for the case of the black hole it
will imply that the calculation of the entropy will be (almost) independent of where
we actually put the boundary. we can choose the horizon, but just as well another
surface. we will discuss this in more detail in [20].
