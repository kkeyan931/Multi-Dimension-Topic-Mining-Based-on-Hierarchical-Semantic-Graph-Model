abstract

the curvature scalar -r/const in the einstein-gilbert action can be replaced by the energy-momentum
scalar of the matter t. this additional energy term in lagrangians of particles and elds does not
disappear on a at space-time and can be considered as a gravitational self-energy. it is shown that this
term in lagrangians of quantum elds naturally induces renormalizational counterterms. as a result
additional counterterms are not needed the introduction.

the renormalizational procedures in the quantum eld theory are very fruitful and appropriate but
theoretically are not good understandable operations. we knew that we must introduce into lagrangians
of elds some compensational terms but we do not knew what these terms mean, what is the source of such
additional terms and what fundamental principles are required of such operations.

in this paper i shall propose a natural renormalizational procedure on the basis of a gravitational self-
energy of particles and elds and in this treatment of the renormalization the answers to the above method-
ological questions will be obvious [1] .

for a classical eld with a lagrangian density l we have the einstein-gilbert action:

s =

1

c z dg(

r + l) =

1

c z d(

2

r + l)

where  = 8k/c4, k is the gravitational constant, r is the ricci tensor, r = gr, l = gl. the

einstein equation for the curvature scalar from this action function is:

r = t

the gravitational term in the action function eq.(1) is usually not considered on a at space-time with

gik = ik and g = 1. but if we rewrite the einstein-gilbert action eq.(1) taking into account eq.(2)

as:

then we see that the rst term can not be simply neglected on the at space-time.
we can neglect it not at the beginning of the quantization of the eld, but after a calculation of vacuum

uctuations contribution.

so, we have an extended classical lagrangian:

an eective lagrangian with quantum corrections can be written as:

l(cl) =

1

t(0) + l(0)

l(q) = l(cl) + l(q) =

t(f in) + l(f in))] + (

where t = t(f in) + t(div) and l = l(f in) + l(div) are total quantum corrections, t(f in)

and l(div) are nite parts of quantum corrections, t(div) and l(div) are divergent parts.

here the renormalized lagrangian l(ren)

(q)

contains only nite terms:

l

(ren)
(q) =

(t(0) + t(f in)) + (l(0) + l(f in)) =

t(ren) + l(ren)

l(div)

(q) =

t(div) + l(div)

we will show that a contribution of the divergent terms l(div)

(q)

to the total energy-momentum of the

system is zero. variations of t(div) and l(div) are:

we have the separate einstein equation for the divergent terms:

as a result, the divergent gravitational (negative energy) contributions exactly compensate of the diver-
gent quantum contributions to the lagrangian of the matter elds. then we can exclude gravitational terms
from the renormalized (nite) part of the lagrangian.

finally, we conclude, that the exclusion of the gravitational self energy terms from the classical la-
grangians of elds is the correct procedure only if we do that after cancellating the divergent terms. but
then we do not need additional divergent counterterms.

in future publications i shall consider applications of this new ideology of the renormalizations to the

quantization of concrete elds (see also [1] ).
