using an eective superpotential in supersymmetric quantum chromodynamics (sqcd) with
nf avors and nc colors of quarks for nf  nc+2, the inuence of soft supersymmetry (susy)
breakings is examined to clarify dynamics of chiral symmetry breakings near the susy limit. in
the case that sqcd triggers spontaneous chiral symmetry breakings, it is possible to show that our
superpotential dynamically favors the successive formation of condensates, leaving either su (nf 
nc) or su (nf  nc + 1) unbroken as a chiral nonabelian symmetry.

i. introduction

it has been argued that n =1 supersymmetric quantum chromodynamics (sqcd) with nf avors and nc colors
of massless quarks exhibits chiral su (nf )  u (1) symmetry which, in the conning phase, will be spontaneously
broken for nf  nc and will remain unbroken for nf  nc+1. the existence of unbroken chiral symmetries are
dynamically supported by non-perturbative superpotential [1,2] and algebraically by the t hooft anomaly-matching
conditions [3]. however, the suggested dynamics of sqcd with nf  nc+2 is based on a plausible extrapolation from
those respecting the marvelous duality in n =2 supersymmetric (susy) gauge thoeries [4]. to utilize this duality
in sqcd, magnetic quarks are set to contribute in the physics of sqcd. the dynamics of magnetic quarks is
not derived, but arranged by our convenience so as to fulll the algebraic requirement from the anomaly-matching
conditions. once such magnetic quarks are admitted to participate in sqcd, every other physical consequences
correctly follows and a massive number of consistency checks are realized [5].

however, what is the magnetic quark? the answer can be found in sqcd embedded in a softly broken n =2
sqcd [6,7], where the scale invariance of the n =2 theory plays a crucial role. the magnetic quarks can be
identied with those appearing in the n =2 sqcd. such a description of the n =1 duality in terms of the n =2
duality is expected to be consistent with the correct physics in sqcd with 3nc/2 < nf < 3nc, where the phase is
characterized as an interacting coulomb phase [1]. on the other hand, in sqcd with nf  3nc/2, where connement
will take place, no direct convincing derivation of the desired physics of magnetic quarks has been made. it is thus
reasonable to start seeking possibilities other than sqcd with magnetic quarks, in other words, the possibility of
spontaneously broken chiral su (nf ) symmetry [8].

in sqcd with nf  nc+2, low-energy chiral symmetry of electric quarks cannot sit on the origin of moduli
space, where no vacuum expectation values are generated, since no set of composite superelds that perfectly satises
the anomaly-matching conditions has been found. to maintain full chiral symmetry as quantum chiral symmetry,
it has been conjectured [1] that the theory experiences phase transition to its magnetic phase, whose weak coupling
regime corresponds to the conned sqcd in the electric phase. the anomalies in the electric theory turn out
to be balanced by those from hypothetical magnetic quarks. however, in spite of the well-motivated physical view,
one may consider a conventional option that the theory undergoes successive spontaneous symmetry breakdown until
the anomaly-matching is realized by nambu-goldstone superelds together with other chiral composite superelds

[9]. the dynamical requirement on the phase transition from the electric phase to the magnetic phase is replaced
by an alternative requirement on the spontaneous chiral symmetry breakdown in the electric phase. both types of
dynamics in sqcd is equally possible to be realized.

in the present article, the dynamics of chiral symmetry breaking is examined to gain more insight into physics
of sqcd. since susy is broken in the real physics, the smooth susy limit of softly broken sqcd [10,11] is also
emphasized in our study. our analyses are performed by the use of an eective superpotential of the veneziano-
yankielowicz type [1214], which, in the susy vacuum, becomes equivalent to seibergs superpotential [1,15]. it will
then be demonstrated that there is a solution that indicates spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. once one vacuum
expectation value (vev) is set to be non-vanishing, the dynamics forces other vev to be generated so that at most
either su (nf  nc) or su (nf  nc + 1) becomes a residual nonabelian chiral symmetry. in the susy breaking
phase, all remaining chiral symmetries will be broken. in 2, our superpotential is formulated. in 3, the properties of
the superpotential together with soft susy breaking terms are examined. the last section is devoted to a summary.

ii. superpotential

our general strategy is to utilize an arbitrariness appearing in the eective superpotential that cannot be elim-
inated by a symmetry principle only [13,16] just as in seibergs superpotential for sqcd with nf = nc+1. the
superelds describing low-energy massless spectra are assumed to come from chiral meson superelds (t ) composed
of a quark-antiquark pair and chiral (anti)baryon superelds (b( b)) by nc-quarks (nc-antiquarks). furthermore,
chiral exotic meson superelds (u ) composed of (nc  1)-quarks and (nc  1)-antiquarks are allowed to participate in
our analyses. combinations of color-singlet states such as (with abbreviated notations), bt nf nc b/det(t ) (=zb)
and u t nf nc+1/det(t ) (=zu ), are totally neutral under the entire set of chiral symmetries as well as an anomalous
u (1) symmetry. therefore, an eective superpotential determined by a symmetry principle can involve any function of
zb and zu as f (zb, zu ). the formation of h0|zb|0i (6= 0) (or h0|zu |0i) leads to the unbroken chiral su (nf nc) (or
su (nf  nc + 1)) symmetry. for su (nf  nc), massless elds are contained in t , b and b while for su (nf  nc + 1)
they are contained in u as well.

our eective superpotential, we , for nc > 2 is dened as

we = s(cid:26)ln(cid:20) sncnf det (t ) f (zb, zu )

3ncnf

(cid:21) + nf  nc(cid:27) ,

(1)

where  is the scale of sqcd and s is a color-singlet bilinear in a chiral gauge supereld, whose scalar component is
, with  a gaugino. the decoupling property is manifest, as discussed in ref. [12]. because the anomaly-matching
conditions are not satised in the full chiral symmetry, it must spontaneously break down to the next stage where
all anomalies present in residual chiral symmetries are consistently generated by massless composite superelds. the
susy vacuum characterized by i (i = 1 nf ) = b = b = u =  = 0 is not dynamically allowed. the  denote

of vanishing gauge coupling g is readily found, by applying the rescaling s  g2s and invoking the denition  
 exp(82/(3nc  nf )g2), to be we  w w/4, which is the tree superpotential for the gauge kinetic term.

to proceed to discussing eects from soft susy breakings, let us include breaking terms in the potential v = vsusy

+ vsoft. the susy-invariant vsusy is dened by

vsusy = gt(cid:18)

|we;i|2(cid:19) + gb(cid:18) xi=b,b

(4)

where we;i = we /i, etc., and gt = gt (t t ) characterizes the kinetic term for t dened by the kahlar
t , and similarly for gb = gb(bb + b b),
potential, k, which is assumed to be diagonal, 2k/t k
gu = gu (u u ) and gs = gs(ss). the susy-breaking is induced by soft breaking masses denoted by li, ri,
i and m through lmass for scalar quarks a

generally expressed as

(5)

it is not necessary for subsequent discussion that all of the  be eective. in contrast to li,ri, the i explicitly break
chiral su (nf ) symmetry and m breaks chiral u (1) symmetry. however, once the breaking masses are generated,
their mass scales are expected to be of the same order. since physics very near the susy-invariant vacua is our main
concern, all breaking masses are kept much smaller than . for composite superelds, lmass is translated into vsoft,
which can be cast into the following form (with higher orders in scalar masses neglected):

iii. spontaneous breaking

now, let us consider a conning phase where t , b and b serve as massless composites. it will be shown that the
favored number of i with vev = o(2) is nc. since the dynamics requires that some of the  acquire non-vanishing
vevs, suppose that one of the i (i=1  nf ) develops a vev, and let this be labeled by i = 1: |1| = 2
t  2.
the conditions on i including h0|zb|0i = zb are simply given by

it should be noted that the eects of eld-dependent kinetic terms can be regarded as extra sources of soft susy

/nc giving i  2, although /i = 0
(i=1 nc) be of the same order; i.e. gt w 
is satised for any values of i including i = 0 as long as  = 0. on the other hand, in the extreme case, where
l1,r1,1=0, there is a solution for which i=2nf = b(b) =  = 0 in the susy limit. however, this is not dynamically
allowed, since the anomaly-matching conditions for the residual chiral symmetries are not fullled. therefore, in the
general case, where all soft breaking masses are of the same order, the susy vacuum is characterized by

e;1/1 =    = gt w 

1  0 as long as m 2

e;nc

thus yielding su (nc)l+r. in other words, once the spontaneous breaking is triggered, then |i=1nc | = 2
natural solution of sqcd, where the soft susy breakings can be consistently introduced.

can be derived. the function f (zb) should satisfy f (zb) = 0, because of /i=nc+1nf = 0 from we;i = 0 and
t . it is consistent to demand that f (zb) = 0 provides the classical constraint of det(t ) = bt nf nc b.
|a=1nc| = 2
the simplest form of f (zb) is then taken to be

f (zb) = (1  zb)

( > 0)

  for   1. this behavior of f (zb) allows us to employ b  / and b  /2, whose magnitude is much
larger than unity.

with this in mind, we further calculate the constraints (7) by inserting we;i=1nc = (1  b)/i and similar

constraints on i=nc+1nf and b(b), which turn out to be

these solutions indicate, in softly broken sqcd, the breakdown of all chiral symmetries that is in agreement with
the result of the dynamics of ordinary qcd [17]. in the susy limit of i=nc+1nf  0 owing to   0, chiral
su (nf  nc) symmetry is preserved. the constraint on the form of the we will arise to ensure the positivity of the
right-hand side of (15) - (17). for instance, (16) and (17) using the denition of m2 give w 
e; > 0. it should be
noted that m 2

sense that the former case with determined parameter, , also describes the same physical properties including the

visible by watching the behavior of sqcd with soft susy breakings in its susy limit. it has been demonstrated that,
to be consistent, soft susy breakings are constrained to include terms of the scalar components with non-vanishing
vev [18]. this is reasonable since m 2
i (i=elds without vev) as long as the
susy-breaking masses are of the same order. in the susy limit, the residual symmetry turns out to include either
su (nc)l+r  su (nf  nc)l  su (nf  nc)r or su (nc  1)l+r  su (nf  nc + 1)l  su (nf  nc + 1)r.
the susy breaking further induces spontaneous breakdown of the residual nonabelian chiral symmetry as in (19),
which is in accord with the result in ordinary qcd physics [17] that all chiral symmetries are spontaneously broken.
the details of the anomaly-matching conditions as well as the possible application to physics of composite quarks and
leptons have been discussed in ref. [16].

i (i=elds with vev ( ))  m 2

it should be noted that the present breakings include a spontaneous breakdown of vector symmetries such as
su (nf )l+r to su (nc)l+r  su (nf  nc)l+r [19]. a similar breakdown of a vector symmetry has already been
found to occur in sqcd with nf = nc, which permits the breaking of u (1) of the baryon number. these breakings are
precisely determined by the dynamics regulated by a relevant eective superpotential, where the anomaly - matching
is a dynamical consequence.

our suggested physical view on symmetry breaking is that the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken to the
vectorial su (nc) symmetry for nf  nc [1,12] and nf  nc + 2 (or to su (nc  1) for nf  nc + 2) as a remnant of
qcd. perhaps the same breaking is dynamically generated in sqcd with nf = nc + 1 although algebraic anomaly-
matching consistency allows the solution of the unbroken chiral su (nf ) symmetry in the electric phase. we expect
that this physics in the electric phase probably persists in sqcd with nf  3nc/2 while sqcd with 3nc/2 < nf
< 3nc will be in the interacting nonabelian coulomb phase [1], where the n =2 duality can be transmitted. whether
h0|t i
of the dierent phase. it is our hope that this issue can be addressed through future lattice calculations that reveal
the real physics of sqcd [20], although the possibility of testing our proposed superpotential remains quite remote.

i |0i(cid:12)(cid:12)=0 is vanishing or non-vanishing is a purely dynamical problem since both cases give the correct susy vacua

note added: there is a work done by n. arkani-hamed and r. rattazzi [21] who have discussed the similar subject
on an instability in the magnetic phase of sqcd near the susy limit and also have pointed out the possibility of
the spontaneous breaking of su (nf )l+r.
