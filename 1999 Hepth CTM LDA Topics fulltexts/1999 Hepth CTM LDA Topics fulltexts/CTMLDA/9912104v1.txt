1. introduction

for more than a decade now, string theory has been a signicant, continuous inuence
in mathematics, ranging from elds as diverse as algebraic geometry to representation
theory. however, it is fair to say that most of these applications concerned the so-called
rst-quantized formulation of the theory, the formulation that is used to describe to prop-
agation of a single string. in contrast with point-particle theories, in string theory the
rst-quantized theory is so powerful because it naturally can be extended to also describe
the perturbative interactions of splitting and joining of strings by means of riemann sur-
faces of general topology. study of these perturbative strings has led to series of remark-
able mathematical developments, such as representation theory of innite-dimensional lie
algebras, mirror symmetry, quantum cohomology and gromov-witten theory.

the second-quantized formalism, what is sometimes also refered to as string eld
theory, has left a much smaller mathematical imprint. although there is a beautiful
geometrical and algebraic structure of perturbative closed string eld theory, developed
mainly by zwiebach [1], which is built on deep features of the moduli space of riemann
surfaces, it is very dicult to analyze, perhaps because it is intrinsically perturbative.
yet, in recent years it has become clear recently that the non-perturbative mathematical
structure of string theory is even richer than the perturbative one, with even bigger
symmetry groupsthe mysterious u-duality groups [2]. the appearance of d-branes
[3] and a eleven-dimensional origin in the form of m-theory [4] can only be properly
understood from a second-quantized point of view.

at present there is only one candidate for a fundamental description of non-perturbative
string theory, which is matrix theory [5]. in matrix theory an important role is played
by non-abelian gauge elds, and the strings and conformal eld theory only emerge in a
certain weak coupling limit. we will not review much of matrix theory in these notes but
refer to for example [6, 7, 8, 9]. important is that matrix theory makes directly contact
with the second-quantized theory, indeed fock spaces are one of the ubiquitous ingredi-
ents, and much of the notes will focus on this correspondence, also reviewing the work of
[10, 11].

1.1. hamilton vs lagrange: representation theory and automorphic forms

one of the most remarkable insights provided by string theory, or more properly
conformal eld theory, is the natural explanation it oers of the modular properties of
the characters of ane kac-moody algebras, heisenberg algebras, and other innite-
dimensional lie algebras. at the hart of this explanationand in fact of much of the
applications of eld theory in mathematicslies the equivalence between the hamiltonian
and lagrangian formulation of quantum mechanics and quantum eld theory.

this equivalence roughly proceeds as follows (see also [15]). in the hamiltonian for-

2

mulation one considers the quantization of a two-dimensional conformal eld theory on a
space-time cylinder r  s1. the basic object is the loop space lx of maps s1  x for
some appropriate target space x. the innite-dimensional hilbert space h that forms the
representation of the algebra of quantum observables is then typically obtained by quan-
tizing the loop space lx. this hilbert space carries an obvious s1 action, generated by
the momentum operator p that rotates the loop, and the character of the representation
is dened as

(q) = tr

qp

h

(1.1)

with q = e2i and  in the complex upper half-plane h. the claim is that these characters
are always some kind of modular forms. from the representation theoretic point of view
it is not at all clear why there should be a natural action of the modular group sl(2, z)
acting on  by linear fractional transformations. in particular the transformation  
1/ is rather mysterious.

in the lagrangian formulation, however, the character (q), or more properly the
partition function, is computed by considering the quantum eld theory on a riemann
surface with topology of a two-torus t 2 = s1  s1, i.e., an elliptic curve with modulus
 . the starting point is the path-integral over all maps t 2  x. since we work with an
elliptic curve, the modularity is built in from the start. the transformation   1/
simply interchanges the two s1s. changing from the hamiltonian to the lagrangian
perspective, we understand the appearance of the modular group sl(2, z) as the classical
automorphism group of the two-torus. this torus is obtained by gluing the two ends of
the cylinder s1  r, which is the geometric equivalent of taking the trace. note that in
string theory this two-torus typically plays the role of a world-sheet.

in second-quantized string theory we expect a huge generalization of this familiar
two-dimensional story. the operator algebras will be much bigger (typically, generalized
kac-moody algebras) and also the automorphism groups will not be of a classical form,
but will reect the stringy geometry at work. an example we will discuss in great detail
in these notes is the quantization of strings on a space-time manifold of the form

m = r  s1  x,

(1.2)

with x a compact simply-connected riemannian manifold. quantization leads again to
a hilbert space h, but this space carries now at least two circle actions.
first, we have again a momentum operator p that generates the translations along
the s1 factor. second, there is also a winding number operator w that counts how many
times a string is wound around this circle. it labels the connected components of the loop
space lm. a state in h with eigenvalue w = m  z represents a string that is wound

3

m times around the s1. in this way we can dene a two-parameter character

(q, p) = tr

pw qp ,

h

(1.3)

with p = e2i, q = e2i , with both ,   h. we will see in concrete examples that these
kind of expressions will be typically the character of a generalized kac-moody algebra
and transform as automorphic forms.

the automorphic properties of such characters become evident by changing again to a
lagrangian point of view and computing the partition function on the compact manifold
t 2 x. concentrating on the t 2 factor, which now has an interpretation as a space-time,
the string partition function carries a manifest t -duality symmetry group

so(2, 2, z) = sl(2, z)  sl(2, z),

(1.4)

which is the stringy automorphism group of t 2.

let us explain briey how this group acts on the moduli ,  . since the string theory
is not a conformal eld theory, the partition function will depend both on the modulus
 of t 2 and on its volume g. furthermore there is an extra dependence on a constant
2-form eld   h 2(t 2, r/z). these two extra data are combined in a second complex
modulus  =  + ig. the t -duality group so(2, 2, z) will now acts on the pair (,  )
by separate fractional linear transformations and the generalized character (1.3) will be
some automorphic form for this group. of course only the second sl(2, z) factor has a
clear geometric interpretation. the rst factor, that exchanges large and small volume
  1/, as a complete stringy origin.

the appearance of the t -duality group so(2, 2, z) as a symmetry group of the two-
torus is most simply explained by considering a single string. we are then dealing with
the loop space lt 2. if the torus is given by the quotient r2/, with  a two-dimensional
lattice, the momenta of such a string take value in the dual lattice

p =i x  .

the winding numbers, that label the components of lt 2, lie in the original lattice

w =i dx  .

(1.5)

(1.6)

therefore the total vector v = (w, p ) can be seen as an element of the rank 4, signature
(2,2), even, self-dual narain lattice

v = (w, p )  2,2 =   ,

v2 = 2 w  p

(1.7)

4

the t -duality group appears now as the automorphism group of the lattice 2,2. in the
particular example we will discuss in detail, where the manifold x is a calabi-yau space,
there will be an extra quantum number and the lattice will be enlarged to a signature
(2,3) lattice. correspondingly, the automorphism group will be given by so(3, 2, z) =
sp(4, z).

2. particles, symmetric products and elds

it is well-known wise-crack that rst-quantization is a mystery but second-quantization
indeed, for a free theory second quantization involves nothing more than
a functor.
taking symmetric products. we obtain the second-quantized hilbert space from the rst-
quantized hilbert space h as the free symmetric algebra sh. yet, recent developments in
string theory (and in certain eld theories that are naturally obtained as limits of string
theories) have provided us with a fresh outlook on this familiar subject. in particular this
new approach allow us to include interactions in new ways.

2.1. second-quantization of superparticles

let us start by considering a well-known case: a point-particle moving on a com-
pact oriented riemannian manifold x. the rst-quantization functor q1 of quantum
mechanics assigns to each manifold x a hilbert space h and a hamiltonian h,

q1 : x 7 (h, h).

(2.1)

as is well-know, in (bosonic) quantum mechanics the hilbert space is given by the square-
integrable functions on x, h = l2(x), together with the positive-denite hamiltonian
h =  1
the hilbert space is now the l2-completion of the space of dierential forms on x,

supersymmetry adds anticommuting variables, and for the supersymmetric particle

2 , with  the laplacian on x.

on this space we can realize the elementary n = 2 supersymmetry algebra

h = (x)

[q, q] = 2h

(2.2)

(2.3)

by the use of the supercharge or dierential q = d and its adjoint q. the spectrum of

5

the hamiltonian is encoded in the partition function

z(x; q, y) = tr

(1)f qhyf

h

(2.4)

with fermion number f given by the degree of the dierential form.

of particular interest is the subspace v  h of supersymmetric ground states, that
satisfy q = q = 0 and therefore also h = 0. these zero-energy wavefunctions are
represented by harmonic dierential forms

v = harm(x) = h (x).

(2.5)

we can compute the weighted number of ground states by the witten index, which denes
a regularized superdimension of the hilbert space

sdimh = tr h(1)f = z(x; q, 1)

(2.6)

since this expression does not depend on q, the witten index simply equals the euler
number of the space x

tr h(1)f = sdim v =xk

(1)k dim h k(x) = (x).

(2.7)

note that here we consider h (x) as a graded vector space generated by b+ even gener-
ators and b odd generators with (x) = b+  b.

2.2. second-quantization and symmetric products

the usual step of second-quantization now consists of considering a system of n of
these (super)particles. it is implemented by the taking the n-th symmetric product of
the single particle hilbert space h

(2.8)

(2.9)

or more properly the direct sum over all n

snh = hn/sn ,

q2 : h  sh =mn 0

snh.

for a graded vector space v = v +  v  with even part v + and odd part v , we dene the
superdimension as sdim v = dim v +  dim v , and, more generally, the supertrace of an operator a
acting on v as str v (a) = tr v + (a)  tr v  (a). so we have sdim v = str v 1 = tr v (1)f . here the
witten index operator (1)f is dened as +1 on v + and 1 on v .

6

we now propose to reverse roles.

instead of taking the symmetric product of the
hilbert space of functions or dierential forms on the manifold x (i.e., the symmetrization
of the quantized manifold), we will take the hilbert space of functions or dierential forms
on the symmetric product snx (i.e., the quantization of the symmetrized manifold)

q2 : x  sx = an 0

snx.

(2.10)

the precise physical interpretation of this role-reversing is the topic of these notes. it will
appear later as a natural framework for the light-cone quantization of string theory and
of a certain class of quantum eld theories that are obtained as low-energy limits of string
theories. we will be particularly interested to learn whether these operations commute
(they will not)

x q1

 h
 q2
 sh

 q2
sx q1

(2.11)

but rst we have to address the issue that the symmetric space snx is not a smooth
manifold but an orbifold, namely the quotient by the symmetric group sn on n elements,

snx = x n/sn .

(2.12)

we will rst be interested in computing the ground states for this symmetric product,
which we have seen are in general counted by the euler number. actually, the relevant
concept will turn out to be the orbifold euler number. using this concept there is a
beautiful formula that was rst discovered by gottsche [16] (see also [17, 18]) in the
context of hilbert schemes of algebraic surfaces, but which is much more generally valid
in the context of orbifolds, as was pointed out by hirzebruch and hofer [19].

first some notation. it is well-known that many formulas for symmetric products take
a much more manageable form if we introduce generating functions. for a general graded
vector space we will use the notation

pn sn v

spv =mn 0

(2.13)

for the weighted formal sum of symmetric products. note that for graded vector spaces the
symmetrization under the action of the symmetric group sn is always to be understood

7

in the graded sense, i.e., antisymmetrization for the odd-graded pieces. we recall that
for an even vector space

dim spv = xn 0

pn dim sn v = (1  p) dim v

whereas for an odd vector space

sdim spv = xn 0

(1)n pn dimvn v = (1  p)dim v

(2.14)

(2.15)

these two formulas can be combined into the single formula valid for an arbitrary graded
vector space that we will use often

sdim spv = (1  p)sdim v

similar we introduce for a general space x the vertex operator

spx = exp px = an 0

pn snx.

(2.16)

(2.17)

using this formal expression the formula we are interested in reads (see also [20])

theorem 1 [16, 19]  the orbifold euler number of the symmetric products snx

are given by

orb(spx) = yn>0

(1  pn)(x).

(2.18)

2.3. the orbifold euler character

the crucial ingredient in theorem 1 is the orbifold euler character, a concept that is

very nicely explained in [19]. here we give a brief summary of its denition.

suppose a nite group g acts on a manifold m. in general this action will not be free
and the space m/g is not a smooth manifold but an orbifold instead. the topological
euler number of this singular space, dened as for any topological space, can be computed
as the alternating sum of the dimensions of the invariant piece of the cohomology,

this can of course be generalized to traces of operators as str (spa) = sdet(1  pa)1.

top(m/g) = sdim h (m)g.

(2.19)

8

in the de rahm cohomology one can also simply take the complex of dierential forms that
are invariant under the g-action and compute the cohomology of the standard dierential
d. this expression can be computed by averaging over the group

top(m/g) =

=

1

|g|xgg
|g|xgg

1

str

g

h (m )

g

1

(2.20)

alternatively, using the lefshetz xed point formula, we can rewrite this euler number
as a sum of xed point contributions. let m g denote the xed point set of the element
g  g. (note that for the identity m 1 = m.) then we have

top(m/g) =

=

1

|g|xgg
|g|xgg

1

sdim h (m g)

1

g

(2.21)

(2.22)

in the above two formulas we used the familiar string theory notation

h

g

= str

h

h (m g )

for the trace of the group element h in the twisted sector labeled by g. note that the two
expressions (2.20) and (2.21) for the topological euler number are related by a modular
s-transformation, that acts as

g

1  1

g

(2.23)

the orbifold euler number is the proper equivariant notion. we see in a moment how
it naturally appears in string theory. in the orbifold denition we remember that on each
xed point set m g there is still an action of the centralizer or stabilizer subgroup cg that
consists of all elements h  g that commute with g. the orbifold cohomology is dened
by including the xed point loci m g, but now taking only the contributions of the cg
invariants. that is, we have a sum over the conjugacy classes [g] of g of the topological
euler character of these strata

orb(m/g) =x[g]

top(m g/cg).

(2.24)

note that this denition always gives an integer, in contrast with other natural denitions
of the euler number of orbifolds. from this point of view the topological euler number

9

only takes into account the trivial class g = 1 (the untwisted sector).
elementary fact that |[g]| = |g|/|cg|, we obtain in this way

if we use the

sdim h (m g)cg

str

h

h (m g)

orb(m/g) =

=

=

1

1

|g|xgg
|g| xg,hg, gh=hg
|g| xg,hg, gh=hg

1

h

g

(2.25)

this denition is manifest invariant under the s-duality that exchanges h and g. we see
that, compared with the topological denition, the orbifold euler number contains extra
contribution of the twisted sectors corresponding to the non-trivial xed point loci m g.
using again lefshetzs formula, it can be written alternatively in terms of the cohomology
of the subspaces m g,h that are left xed by both g and h as

orb(m/g) =

1

|g| xg,hg, gh=hg

sdim h (m g,h).

(2.26)

it has been pointed out by segal [21] that much of this and in particular the applications
to symmetric products that we are about to give, nd a natural place in equivariant k-
theory. indeed the equivariant k-group (tensored with c) of a space m with a g action
is isomorphic to

kg(m) =m[g]

k(m g)cg .

(2.27)

2.4. the orbifold euler number of a symmetric product

we now apply the above formalism to the case of the quotient x n/sn . for the
topological euler number the result is elementary. we simply replace h (x) by its
symmetric product snh (x). since we take the sum over all symmetric products, graded
by n, this is just the free symmetric algebra on the generators of h (x), so that [22]

top(spx) = sdim sph (x) = (1  p)(x)

(2.28)

in order to prove the orbifold formula (2.18) we need to include the contributions of
the xed point sets. thereto we recall some elementary facts about the symmetric group.

10

first, the conjugacy classes [g] of sn are labeled by partitions {nn} of n, since any group
element can be written as a product of elementary cycles (n) of length n,

[g] = (1)n1(2)n2 . . . (k)nk, xn>0

nnn = n.

(2.29)

the xed point set of such an element g is easy to describe. the symmetric group acts
on n-tuples (x1, . . . , xn )  x n . a cycle of length n only leaves a point in x n invariant
if the n points on which it acts coincide. so the xed point locus of a general g in the
above conjugacy class is isomorphic to

(x n )g = yn>0

x nn.

the centralizer of such an element is a semidirect product of factors snn and zn,

cg = sn1  (sn2

 zn2

2 )  . . . (snk

 znk

k ).

(2.30)

(2.31)

here the factors snn permute the nn cycles (n), while the factors zn act within one
particular cycle (n). the action of the centralizer cg on the xed point set (x n )g is
obvious: only the subfactors snn act non-trivially giving

(x n )g/cg = yn>0

snnx.

(2.32)

we now only have to assemble the various components to compute the orbifold euler
number of snx:

pn orb(snx)

orb(spx) = xn 0
= xn 0
= yn>0 xn 0
= yn>0

top(snnx)

pn x{nn}
p nnn=n yn>0

pnn top(sn x)

(1  pn)(x)

(2.33)

which concludes the proof of (2.18).

11

2.5. orbifold quantum mechanics on symmetric products

the above manipulation can be extended beyond the computation of the euler number
to the actual cohomology groups. we will only be able to fully justify these denitions
(because thats what it is at this point) from the string theory considerations that we
present in the next section. for the moment let us just state that in particular cases
where the symmetric product allows for a natural smooth resolution (as for the algebraic
surfaces studied in [16] where the hilbert scheme provides such a resolution), we expect
the orbifold denition to be compatible with the usual denition in terms of the smooth
resolution.

we easily dene a second-quantized, innite-dimensional graded fock space whose
graded superdimensions equal the euler numbers that we just computed. starting with
the single particle ground state hilbert space

v = h (x)

(2.34)

we dene it as the symmetric algebra of an innite number of copies v (n) graded by
n = 1, 2, . . .

fp =on>0

spnv (n) = s(cid:16)mn>0

pnv (n)(cid:17).

(2.35)

here v (n) is a copy of v where the number operator n is dened to have eigenvalue n,
so that

orb(spx) = tr

f

(1)f pn = yn>0

(1  pn)(x).

(2.36)

we will see later that the degrees in v (n) are naturally shifted by (n  1) d
dimension of x, so that

2 with d the

v (n) = h (n1) d

2 (x),

n > 0.

(2.37)

of course, this denition makes only good sense for even d, which will be the case since
we will always consider kahler manifolds.

this result can be interpreted as follows. we have seen that the xed point loci
consist of copies of x. these copies x (n) appear as the big diagonal inside snx where all
n points come together. if we think in terms of middle dimensional cohomology, which
is particularly relevant for kahler and hyperkahler manifolds, this result tells us that the
middle dimensional cohomology of x contributes through x (n) to the middle dimensional
cohomology of snx.

12

so, if we dene the poincare polynomial as

p (x; y) = z(x; 0, y) = tr

v

(1)f yf = x0kd

(1)kykbk(x),

(2.38)

then we claim that the orbifold poincare polynomials of the symmetric products snx are
given by

porb(spx; y) = yn>0

0kd

(cid:16)1  yk+(n1) d

2 pn(cid:17)(1)kbk

(2.39)

this is actually proved for the hilbert scheme of an algebraic surface in [17, 18].

although we will only be in a position to understand this well in the next section,
we can also determine the full partition function that encodes the quantum mechanics on
snx. again the hilbert space is a fock space built on an innite number of copies of the
single particle hilbert space h(x)

horb(spx) =on>0

spnh(n)(x).

(2.40)

the contribution to the total hamiltonian of the states in the sector h(n) turns out to be
scaled by a factor of n relative to the rst-quantized particle, whereas the fermion number
are shifted as before, so that

h(n) = (n1) d

2 (x),

h (n) =  1

2/n.

(2.41)

to be complete explicit, let {h(m, k)}m0 be the spectrum of h on the subspace k(x)
of k-forms with degeneracies c(m, k), so that the single particle partition function reads

z(x; q, y) = tr

h

(1)f yf qh = xn>0

0kd

c(m, k)ykqh(m,k).

(2.42)

then we have for the symmetric product (in the orbifold sense)

zorb(spx; q, y) = tr

horb(sx)

= yn>0, m0

0kd

(1)f pn qhyf
(cid:16)1  pnqh(m,k)/nyk+(n1) d

2(cid:17)c(m,k)

(2.43)

these degeneracies are consistently dened as superdimensions of the eigenspaces, so that c(m, k)  0

for k odd, and c(0, k) = (1)kbk.

13

in later sections we give a qft interpretation of this formula.

3. second-quantized strings

the previous section should be considered just as a warming-up for the much more
interesting case of string theory. we will now follow all of the previous steps again, going
from a single quantized string to a gas of second-quantized strings. in many respects this
construction  in particular the up to now rather mysterious orbifold prescription  is
more canonical, and all of the previous results can be obtained as a natural limiting case
of the string computations.

3.1. the two-dimensional supersymmetric sigma model

in the lagrangian formulation the supersymmetric sigma model that describes the
propagation of a rst-quantized string on a riemannian target space x is formulated in
terms of maps x :   x with  a riemann surface, that we will often choose to give the
topology of a cylinder s1  r or a torus t 2. the canonical euclidean action, including
the standard topological term, is of the form

1

4 z

g(x)dx  dx +

i

2 z

xb + fermions

(3.1)

with g the riemannian metric and b a closed two-form on x.

an important feature of the two-dimensional sigma model that in the limit   0 it
reduces to the supersymmetric quantum mechanics of the previous section. this limit can
be equivalently seen as a rescaling of the metric g and thereby a low-energy or a large-
volume limit, vol(x)  . in this point-particle limit the dependence on the b-eld
disappears.

in the hamiltonian formulation one describes a single string moving on a space x in
terms of the loop space lx of maps s1  x. depending on the particular type of string
theory that we are interested in, this rst-quantization leads us to assign to the manifold
x a single string scft hilbert space

q1 : x  h(x),

(3.2)

that can be formally considered to be the space of half-innite dimensional dierential
forms on lx. we will always choose in the denition of h ramond or periodic bound-
ary conditions for the fermions. these boundary conditions respect the supersymmetry
algebra; other boundary conditions can be obtained by spectral ow [23].

14

on this hilbert space act two natural operators: the hamiltonian h, roughly the
generalized laplacian on lx, and the momentum operator p that generates the canonical
circle action on the loop space corresponding to rotations of the loop,

eip : x() 7 x( + ).

(3.3)

in a conformal eld theory the operators h and p are usually written in terms of left-
moving and right-moving virasoro generators l0 and l0 as

h = l0 + l0  d/4,

p = l0  l0.

(3.4)

here d is the complex dimension of x.
if the manifold x is a calabi-yau space, the
quantum eld theory carries an n = 2 superconformal algebra with a u(1)l  u(1)r
r-symmetry. in particular this allows us to dene separate left-moving and right-moving
conserved fermion numbers fl and fr, that up to an innite shift (that is naturally
regularized in the qft) represent the bidegrees in terms of the dolbeault dierential
forms on (lx).

the most general partition function is written as

z(x; q, y, q, y) = tr

h

(1)f yflyfrql0 d

8 ql0 d

with f = fl + fr the total fermion number. the partition function z represents the
value of the path-integral on a torus or elliptic curve, and we can write q = e2i , y = e2iz
with  the modulus of the elliptic curve and z a point in its jacobian that determines
the line-bundle of which the fermions are sections. the spectrum of all four operators
l0, l0, fl, fr is discrete with the further conditions

l0, l0  d/8,

l0  l0  z,

fl, fr  z + d
2 .

(3.6)

for a general calabi-yau manifold it is very dicult to compute the above partition func-
tion explicitly. basically, only exact computations have been done for orbifolds and the
so-called gepner points, which are spaces with exceptional large quantum automorphism
groups. this is not surprising, since even in the   0 limit we would need to know
the spectrum of the laplacian, while for many calabi-yau spaces such as k3 an explicit
ricci at metric is not even known.

just as for the quantum mechanics case, we learn a lot by considering the supersym-
metric ground states   v  h that satisfy h = 0. in the ramond sector the ground

15

states are canonically in one-to-one correspondence with the cohomology classes in the
dolbeault groups,

v = h ,(x).

(3.7)

in fact, these states have special values for the conserved charges. ramond ground states
always have l0 = l0 = d/8, and for a ground state that corresponds to a cohomology
class   h r,s(x) the fermion numbers are shifted degrees

fl = r  d/2,

fr = s  d/2.

(3.8)

the shift in degrees by d/2 is a result from the fact that we had to ll up the innite
fermi sea. we see that there is an obvious reection symmetry fl,r  fl,r (poincare
duality) around the middle dimensional cohomology. if we take the limit q, q  0, the
partition function reduces essentially to the poincare-hodge polynomial of x

h(x; y, y) = lim
q,q0

z(x; q, q, y, y)

= x0r,sd

(3.9)

3.2. the elliptic genus

an interesting specialization of the sigma model partition function is the elliptic genus

of x [24], dened as

(x; q, y) = tr

(1)f yflql0 d

8

h

(3.10)

the elliptic genus is obtained as a specialization of the general partition function for
y = 1. its proper denition is

(x; q, y) = tr

h

(1)f yflql0 d

8 ql0 d

8

(3.11)

but, just as for the witten index, because of the factor (1)fr there are no contributions
of states with l0  d/8 > 0. only the right-moving ramond ground states contribute.
the genus is therefore holomorphic in q or  . since this xes l0  d/8 to be an integer,
the partition function becomes a topological index, with no dependence on the moduli of
x.

using general facts of modular invariance of conformal eld theories, one deduces that
for a calabi-yau d-fold the elliptic genus is a weak jacobi form [25] of weight zero and

16

index d/2. (for odd d one has to include multipliers or work with certain nite index
subgroups, see [26, 27, 28].) the ring of jacobi forms is nitely generated, and thus
nite-dimensional for xed index. it has a fourier expansion of the form

(x; q, y) = xm0, 

c(m, )qmy

(3.12)

with integer coecients. the terminology weak refers to the fact that the term m = 0
is included.

the elliptic genus has beautiful mathematical properties.

if x = y ,

(3.13)

where the last relation is in the sense of complex bordism. the rst two relations are
obvious from the quantum eld theory point of view; they are valid for all partition
functions of sigma models. the last condition follows basically from the denition in terms
of classical dierential topology, more precisely in terms of chern classes of symmetrized
products of the tangent bundle, that we will give in a moment. we already noted that in
the limit q  0 the genus reduces to a weighted sum over the hodge numbers, which is
essentially the hirzebruch y-genus,

(x; 0, y) =xr,s

(1)r+shr,s(x)yr d
2 ,

and for y = 1 its equals the witten index or euler number of x

(x; q, 1) = tr h(1)f = (x).

for smooth manifolds, the elliptic genus has an equivalent denition as

(3.14)

(3.15)

for example, in the case d = 2 it is one-dimensional and generated by the elliptic genus of k3.

ch(eq,y)td(x)

(3.16)

(x; q, y) =zx

with the formal sum of vector bundles

eq,y = y d

2 on>0(cid:16)vyqn1tx vy1qnt x  sqntx  sqnt x(cid:17),

(3.17)

where tx denotes the holomorphic tangent bundle of x. if the bundle ey,q is expanded
as

qmyem,

eq,y =mm, 

(3.18)

the coecients c(m, ) give the index of the dirac operator on x twisted with the vector
bundle em,, and are therefore integers. this denition follows from the sigma model by
taking the large volume limit, where curvature terms can be ignored and one essentially
reduces to the free model, apart from the zero modes that give the integral over x.

3.3. physical interpretation of the elliptic genus

physically, the elliptic genus arises in two interesting circumstances. first, it appears
as a counting function of perturbative string bps states. if one constrains the states of the
string to be in a right-moving ground state, i.e., to satisfy l0 = d/8, the states are invari-
ant under part of the space-time supersymmetry algebra and called bps. the generating
fucntion of such states is naturally given by the elliptic genus. because we weight the
right-movers with the chiral witten index (1)fr, only the right-moving ground states
contribute.

another physical realization is the so-called half-twisted model. starting from a n = 2
superconformal sigma model, we can obtain a topological sigma model, by changing the
spins of the fermionic elds. this produces two scalar nilpotent brst operators ql, qr
that can be used to dene cohomological eld theories.
if we use both operators, or
equivalently the combination q = ql + qr, the resulting eld theory just computes the
quantum cohomology of x. this topological string theory is the appropriate framework to
understand the gromov-witten invariants. if we ignore interactions for the moment, the
free spectrum is actually that of a quantum eld theory. indeed, the gauging implemented
by the brst operator removes all string oscillations, forcing the states to be both left-
moving and right-moving ground states

l0 = l0 = 0.

(3.19)

only the harmonic zero-modes contribute. in this way one nds one quantum eld for
every dierential form on the space-time. this is precisely the model that we discussed
in the previous section.

18

however, as rst suggested by witten in [29], it is also possible to do this twist only
in that case, we have to compute the cohomology of the
for the right-moving elds.
right-moving brst operator qr. this cohomology has again harmonic representatives
with l0 = 0. these states coincide with the bps states mentioned above. the half-
twisted cohomology is no longer nite-dimensional, but it is graded by l0 and fl and the
dimensions of these graded pieces are encoded in the elliptic genus. so, the half-twisted
string is a proper string theory with an innite tower of heavy states.

3.4. second-quantized elliptic genera

we now come to analogue of the theorem of gottsche and hirzebruch for the elliptic

genus as it was conjectured in [30] and derived in [10].

theorem 2 [10]  the orbifold elliptic genus of the symmetric products snx are

given by

orb(spx; q, y) = yn>0, m0, 

(1  pnqmy)c(nm,)

(3.20)

in order to prove this result, we have to compute the elliptic genus or, more generally,
the string partition function for the orbifold m/g with m = snx and g = sn . the
computation follows closely the computation of the orbifold euler character that was
relevant for the point-particle case.

first of all, the decomposition of the hilbert space in superselection sectors labeled
by the conjugacy class of an element g  g follows naturally. the superconformal sigma
model with target space m can be considered as a quantization of the loop space lm.
if we choose as our target space an orbifold m/g, the loop space l(m/g) will have
disconnected components of loops in m satisfying the twisted boundary condition

x( + 2) = g  x(),

g  g,

(3.21)

and these components are labeled by the conjugacy classes [g]. in this way, we nd that
the hilbert space of any orbifold conformal eld theory decomposes naturally into twisted
sectors. furthermore, in the untwisted sector we have to take the states that are invariant
under g. for the twisted sectors we can only take invariance under the centralizer cg,
which is the largest subgroup that commutes with g. if hg indicates the sector twisted
by g, the orbifold hilbert space has therefore the general form [31]

h(m/g) =m[g]

fig. 1: a twisted sector of a sigma model on snx can
describe less than n strings. (here n = 9 and the sector
contains three long strings.)

in the point-particle limit   0 the size of all loops shrinks to zero. for the twisted
boundary condition this means that the loop gets necessarily concentrated on the xed
point set m g and we are in fact dealing with a point-particle on m g/cg. in this way the
string computation automatically produces the prescription for the orbifold cohomology
that we discussed before.
indeed, as we stress, the quantum mechanical model of the
previous section can best be viewed as a low-energy limit of the string theory.

in the case of the symmetric product snx, the orbifold superselection sectors corre-
spond to partitions {nn} of n. furthermore, we have seen that for a given partition the
xed point locus is simply the product

snnx (n)

yn

(3.23)

here we introduce the notation x (n), to indicate a copy of x obtained as the diagonal in
x n where n points coincide. in the case of point-particles this distinction was not very
important but for strings it is absolutely crucial.

the intuition is best conveyed with the aid of g. 1. where we depicted a generic
twisted sector of the orbifold sigma model. the crucial point is that such a conguration
can be interpreted as describing long strings whose number can be smaller than n.
indeed, as we clearly see, a twisted boundary condition containing a elementary cycle of
length n gives rise to a single string of length n built out of n string bits. if the cycle
permutes the coordinates (x1, . . . , xn)  x n as
xk( + 2) = xk+1(),

(3.24)

the physical signicance of this picture was developed in among others [32, 33, 34] and made precise

k  (1, . . . , n),

in [10].

20

we can construct a new loop x() by gluing the n strings x1(), . . . , xn() together:

x() = xk()

if  = 1

n(2(k  1) + ),   [0, 2].

(3.25)

if the twist element is the cycle (n)  sn , such a conguration describes one single long
string of length n, instead of the n short strings that we would expect.

in this fashion we obtain from a cyclic twist (n) one single copy of the loop space lx
that we denote as lx (n). we use the notation h(n) for its quantization. the twisted
loop space lx (n) is distinguished from the untwisted loop space lx in that the canonical
circle action is dierently normalized. we now have

eip : x()  x( + /n).

(3.26)

so we nd that only for  = 2n do we have a full rotation of the loop. this is obvious
from the twisted boundary condition (3.24). it seems to imply that the eigenvalues for
the operator p = l0  l0 in this sector are quantized in units of 1/n. together with the
fact that in the elliptic genus only states with l0 = 0 contribute, this would suggest that
the contribution of the sector h(n) to the elliptic genus is

(h(n); q, y) ?=xm,

c(m, )qm/ny.

(3.27)

however, we must remember that the centralizer of a cycle of length n contains a factor
zn. this last factor did not play a role in the point-particle case, but here it does act
non-trivially. in fact, it is precisely generated by e2ip . the orbifold denition includes a
prescription to take the states that are invariant under the action of the centralizer. so
only the states with integer eigenvalues of p survive. in this way only the states with m
congruent to 0 modulo n survive and we obtain an integer q-expansion,

(h(n); y, q) =xm,

c(nm, )qmy.

(3.28)

we now again assemble the various components to nish the proof of (3.20) (for more
details see [10]).

pn orb(snx; q, y) = xn 0

yn>0
we use the more general notation (h; q, y) = trh(1)f ql0 d

(3.29)

the innite product formula has strong associations to automorphic forms and denom-
inator formulas of generalized kac-moody algebras [35] and string one-loop amplitudes
[36]; we will return to this.

3.5. general partition function

it is not dicult to repeat the above manipulations in symmetric algebra for the full
partition function. in fact, we can write a general formula for the second-quantized string
fock space, similar as we did for the point-particle case in (2.35). this fock space is again
of the form

fp =on>0

spnh(n).

(3.30)

here h(n) is the hilbert space obtained by quantizing a single string that is wound n
times. it is isomorphic to the subspace of the single string hilbert space h = h(1) with

l0  l0 = 0 (mod n).

(3.31)

the action of the operators l0 and l0 on h(n) are then rescaled by a factor 1/n compared
with the action on h

(3.32)

l(n)
0 = l(1)

0 /n,

l

(n)
0 = l

(1)
0 /n.

as we explained already, this rescaling is due to the fact that the string has now length
(n)
2n instead of 2. even though the world-sheet hamiltonians l(n)
0 have fractional
spectra compared to the single string hamiltonians, the momentum operator still has an
integer spectrum,

0 , l

l(n)
0  l

(n)
0 = 0 (mod 1),

(3.33)

due to the restriction (3.31) that is implemented by the orbifold zn projection.

it is interesting to reconsider the ground states of h(n) in particular their u(1)lu(1)r
charges, since this will teach us something about the orbifold cohomology of snx. a
ground state (n)  v (n) that correspond to a cohomology class   h r,s(x) still has
fermion charges fl, fr given by

fl = r  d/2,

fr = s  d/2.

(3.34)

22

making the string longer does not aect the u(1) current algebra. however, since these
states now appear as a ground states of a conformal eld theory with target space snx,
which is of complex dimension n  d, these fermion numbers have a dierent topological
interpretation. the corresponding degrees r(n), s(n) of the same state now considered as
a dierential form in the orbifold cohomology of snx  snx are therefore shifted as

r(n) = r + (n  1)d/2,

s(n) = s + (n  1)d/2.

that is, we have

v (n) = h (n1) d

2 ,(n1) d

2 (x).

(3.35)

(3.36)

in the quantum mechanics limit, the twisted loops that give rise to the contribution h(n)
in the fock space become point-like and produce another copy x (n) of the xed point set
x. however, this copy of x is the big diagonal in x n. we see that this gives another
copy of h (x) however now shifted in degree. in the full fock space we have an innite
number of copies, shifted by positive multiples of (d/2, d/2).

we can encode this all in the generating function of hodge numbers (3.9) as

horb(spx; y, y) = yn>0, r, s

(1  pnyrys)(1)r+shr,s(x)

for the full partition function we can write a similar expression

zorb(spx; q, q, y, y) = yn>0 yh, h, r, s

hh=0 (mod n)

(cid:16)1  pnqhqhyrys(cid:17)c(h,h,r,s)

(3.37)

(3.38)

where

z(x; q, q, y, y) = xh, h, r, s

c(h, h, r, s)qhqhyrys

(3.39)

is the single string partition function.

4. light-cone quantization of quantum field theories

we now turn to the physical interpretation of the above results. usually quantum
eld theories are quantized by splitting, at least locally, a lorentzian space-time in the
form r  where r represents the time direction and  is a space-like cauchy manifold.

23

classically, one species initial data on  which then deterministically evolve through
some set of dierential equations in time. in recent developments it has proven useful to
use for the time direction a null direction. this complicates of course the initial value
problem, but has some other advantages. one can try to see this a limiting case where one
uses lorentz transformations to boost the time-like direction to an almost null direction
[37].

4.1. the two-dimensional free scalar eld revisited

before we turn to the interpretation of our results on second quantization and sym-
metric products in terms of quantum eld theory and quantum string theory, let us rst
revisit one of the simplest examples of a qft and compute the partition function of a
two-dimensional free scalar eld. in fact, let us be slightly more general and consider a
nite number c of such scalar elds labeled by a c-dimensional real vector space v . (one
could easily take this vector space to be graded, but for simplicity we assume it to be
even.)

quantization of this model usually proceeds as follows: one chooses a two-dimensional
space-time with the topology of a cylinder r  s1 and with coordinates (x0, x1). one
then introduces the light-cone variables x = x0  x1. a classical solution of the equation
of motion  = 0 is decomposed as

(x+, x) = q + px0 + l(x) + r(x+),

(4.1)

where the zero-mode contribution (describing a point particle on v with coordinate q and
conjugate momentum p) is isolated from the left-moving and right-moving oscillations
l(x) and r(x+). the non-zero modes have a fourier expansion

l(x) =xn6=0

1

n neinx

(4.2)

with a similar expression for r(x+).

in canonical quantization the fourier oecients n are replaced by creation and anni-
hilation operators with commutation relations [n, m] = nn+m. this heisenberg algebra
is realized on a fock space f built on a vacuum state |0i satisfying n|0i = 0 for n > 0.
this fock space can be written in terms of symmetric products as

fp =on>0

spnv (n) = s(cid:16)mn>0

pnv (n)(cid:17),

(4.3)

24

where v (n) is a copy of v with the property that the (chiral) oscillation number operator
n has eigenvalue n on v (n). the p-expansion keeps track of the n-gradation. as a
quantum operator n is dened as

nn.

n =xn>0

(4.4)

the chiral partition function is now written as a character of this module (with p = e2i ,
 in the upper half-plane h)

(p) = dimfp = tr

f

pn = yn>0

(1  pn)c

(4.5)

this character is almost a modular form of weight c/2. one way to see this, is by
considering the partition function of the full hilbert space h, which is modular invariant.
h is obtained by combining the left-moving oscillators with the right-moving oscillators
and adding the zero-mode contribution

the total chiral hamiltonians can be written as

h = l2(v )  f  f

l0 =  1

2  + n,

l0 =  1

2  + n .

the full partition function is then evaluated as

z(p, p) = tr

pl0c/24pl0c/24 =(cid:16)im |(p)|2(cid:17)c

h

with (p) the weierstrass eta-function

(p) = p

so the proper modular object is given by

(1  pn).

1

24 yn>0

(4.6)

(4.7)

(4.8)

(4.9)

pn c/24 = (p)c

tr

f

(4.10)

which is a modular form of sl(2, z) of weight c/2 (with multipliers if c 6= 0 (mod 24).)
the extra factor pc/24 is interpreted as a regularized innite sum of zero-point energies
that appear in canonical quantization.

25

in the lagrangian formalism the same result is given in terms of a -function regular-

ized determinant of c scalar elds

z = (im  / det )c/2

(4.11)

with  the laplacian on the torus t 2 and the prime indicates omission of the zero-mode.
this determinant can be computed in a rst-quantized form as a one-loop integral

log z =  1

2 log det  =  1

2 tr log  =z 

0

dt

eth

h

(4.12)

with h = l2(t 2) is now the quantum mechanical hilbert space of a single particle moving
on t 2. here the rhs is dened by cutting of the integral at t =  and subtracting the
-dependent (but  -independent) term.

let us mention a few aspects of these results that we will try to generalize when we

consider strings instead of quantum elds in the next section.

1. the quantum eld theory partition function factorizes in left-moving and right-

moving contributions that are holomorphic functions of the modulus p.

2. the holomorphic contributions are modular forms of weight c/2 under sl(2, z)

if a particular correction (here pc/24) is added.

3. the full partition fucntion is modular invariant because the zero-mode contribution

adds a non-holomorphic factor (im  )c/2.

4. the holomorphic contributions are characters of an innite-dimensional kac-moody
algebra, in fact in this simple case just the heisenberg algebra generated by the
operators n.

5. the modularity of the characters, i.e., the transformation properties under the
modular group sl(2, z) is explained by the relation to a partition function of a
quantum eld on a two-torus t 2 with modulus  and automorphism group sl(2, z).

4.2. discrete light-cone quantization

in light-cone quantization one works on r1,1 in terms of the light-cone coordinates x

with metric

ds2 = 2dx+dx,

(4.13)

26

but now chooses the null direction x+ as the time coordinate. we will write the conjugate
momenta as

p+ = p = i


x ,

p = p+ = i


x+ .

(4.14)

in the usual euclidean formulation of two-dimensional cft we have p+ = l0, p = l0. in
this setup a free particle has an eigentime given by x+ = p+t. the light-cone hamiltonian
describes evolution in the light-cone time x+ and so is given by

hlc = p

(4.15)

an initial state is specied by the x-dependence for xed x+.

the so-called discrete light-cone quantization (dlcq) further assumes that the null

direction x is compact of radius r

x  x + 2r.

(4.16)

(the specic value of r is not very important since it can of course be rescaled by a
lorentz boost. we will therefore often put it to one, r = 1.) we denote the lorentzian
manifold so obtained as (rs1)1,1. the periodic identication of x makes the spectrum
of the conjugate momentum p+ discrete

p+  n/r,

n  z.

now we have for xed x+ a decomposition of the scalar eld as

(x) =xn6=0

1

n neinx

(4.17)

(4.18)

(clearly, this quantization scheme is incomplete, since we are omitting the zero-modes
with p+ = 0. we will only obtain the left-moving sector of the theory. we will return to
this point.) since the classical equation for a free eld reads

+ = 0,

(4.19)

the eld (x) will have no x+-dependence and therefore the light-cone energy of its
modes will vanish, p = 0. if we have c of these free scalar elds (x)  v , quantization
will result in the same chiral fock space that we considered in the canonical quantization

spnv (n)

fp =on>0

27

(4.20)

and the light-cone partition function is given by same innite product

pp +

tr

f

(1  pn)c

= yn>0

(4.21)

note that the eigenvalues of the longitudinal momentum p + = n are always positive.
this is due to the fact that the oscillation numbers n form a heisenberg algebra.

we recognize in these formulas our computations of the euler number of the symmetric
products of a space x with (x) = c. to explain this relation we now consider the light-
cone quantization of eld theories in higher dimensions.

4.3. higher-dimensional scalar elds in dlcq

things become a bit more interesting if we consider a free scalar eld on a more general

space-time of the form

m 1,d+1 = (r  s1)1,1  x d,

(4.22)

x compact riemannian and with light-cone coordinates (x+, x, x). we adopt light-cone
quantization and consider as initial data the eld conguration on x+ = constant. the
light-cone hamiltonian p again describes the evolution in x+. it will be convenient to
perform a fourier transformation in the light-cone coordinate x and consider a basis of
eld congurations of the form

(x+, x, x) = ei(px++p+x)m(x)

(4.23)

with p+ = n (we put r = 1) and m(x) an eigenstate of the transverse hamiltonian
h =  1

2 (x),

hm = hmm.

(4.24)

the equation of motion on the space-time m, (m ) = 0, then gives the so-called mass-
shell relation

p = 

1
2p+ (x) =

1
n

hm.

(4.25)

here we see an interesting phenomenon. the light-cone energy is given by a non-
relativistic expression of the form p2/2m, where p is the transversal momentum and the
mass m is given by the longitudinal momentum p+ = n. (on a curved manifold p2 is
replaced by the eigenvalues hm of the laplacian.) the appearance of this non-relativistic
expression has it geometric explanation in the fact that the stabilizer group of a null-
direction in r1,n+1 is the galilean group of rn. the formula implies that for a particle
with p+ = n, the light-cone energy p is rescaled by a factor of 1/n.

28

note that quite generally in light-cone quantization the symmetries of the underlying
if we work with the minkowski space-time
space-time manifold are not all manifest.
r1,n+1 the lorentz group so(1, n + 1) is partly non-linearly realized. for interacting
qfts the proof of lorentz invariance of a light-cone formulation is highly non-trivial. in
dlcq the lorentz-invariance is only expected in the limit r  . since the value of r
can be rescaled by a lorentz boost, this limit is equivalent to the large n limit, n  .
again, for interacting theories the appearance of lorentz-invariance in this limit is not
obvious.

upon quantization we obtain in the present case a fock space that is of the form

fp =on>0mn 0

pnn snh(n)

(4.26)

with h(n) = l2(x) with p = h (n) = h/n the rescaled qm hamiltonian. now the
light-cone energies p will not typically vanish, and the full partition function is given by
a two-variable function,

z(x, p, q) = tr

pp +

qp 

,

f

(4.27)

with p +, p  the total light-cone momentum operators (with eigenvalues p+, p).

from the above description is should have become clear that this partition function
can be completely identied with the quantum mechanics on the symmetric product space

spx =`n pn snx that we discussed in such details in section 2. we therefore obtain:
theorem 3  the discrete light-cone quantization of a free scalar eld on the space-
time m = (r  s1)1,1  x with total longitudinal momentum p+ = n is given by the
quantum mechanics on the orbifold symmetric product snx,

hqf t (x) = hqm

orb (sx).

(4.28)

furthermore, the light-cone hamiltonian p is identied with the non-relativistic quantum
mechanics hamiltonian h.

4.4. the supersymmetric generalization

it is easy to extend this construction to a physical system that describes the super-
symmetric quantum mechanics on sx. in that case we want to have arbitrary dierential
forms on x, so our fundamental elds will be free k-forms k  k(m) with 0  k  d on
the space-time m = (r s1)1,1 x. these elds have a quadratic action (with fermionic

29

statistics if k is odd)

zy

1

2d  d,

 =xk

k  (y ).

this gives as equation of motion the maxwell equation

dd = 0.

this lagrangian is invariant under the gauge symmetry

k  k + dk1,

  k1(m),

(4.29)

(4.30)

(4.31)

giving k the interpretation of a generalized k-form connection with curvature dk. this
gauge symmetry can be xed by requiring

/x+ = 0,

(4.32)

a condition that we write as + = 0. with this gauge condition the equation of motion can
be used to eliminate the component  in terms of the transversal components   (x),
leaving only the form on the transverse space x as physical. all of this is well-known from
the description of the rr elds of the light-cone type ii superstring (or supergravity).

with this gauge xing we naturally reduce the second-quantized light-cone descrip-
tion to supersymmetric quantum mechanics on sx. we therefore nd exactly the eld
theoretic description of our sqm model of section 2. it describes the multi-form abelian
gauge eld theory on m = (r  s1)1,1  x in dlcq, in particular we have

hqf t (x) = hsqm

orb

(spx) =on

spn(x)(n)

(4.33)

where powers of p keep track of the longitudinal momentum p+.

particular interesting is the zero-energy p = 0 sector v qf t  hqf t . since p is
identied with the sqm hamiltonian, these states correspond the ground states of the
supersymmetric quantum mechanics and we have

v qf t =on>0

spnh (x)

30

(4.34)

and the partition function of this zero p sector reproduces exactly the orbifold euler
character

tr

vqf t

(1)f pp +

= orb(spx).

(4.35)

the modular properties are now explained along the lines of section 1. this partition
function can be computed in a lagrangian formulation by considering the compact space-
time t 2  x. the explicit t 2 factor explain the occurrence of sl(2, z).

the modular properties are particularly nice if we choose as our manifold x to be a
k3 surface with (x) = 24. we then almost have a modular object without multipliers,

orb(spx) =

p

(p)

(4.36)

with (p) = 24(p) the discriminant, a cusp form of weight 12 for sl(2, z). the correction
p/24 has again an interpretation as the regularized sum of zero-point energies. (each
boson contributes 1/24, each fermion +1/24.)

5. light-cone quantization of string theories

it is now straightforward to generalize all this to string theory along the lines

quantum mechanics on sx  quantum eld theory on x
2-d conformal eld theory on sx  quantum string theory on x

the interest in this generalization lies in particular in the absence of a good lorentz-
invariant description of non-perturbative second-quantized quantum string theory. so we
can gain something by studying the reformulation in terms of sigma models on symmetric
products

it is not dicult to give a string theory interpretation of our results in section 3 on
sigma models on symmetric product spaces. clearly we want to identify the dlcq of
string theory on (rs1)1,1x with the scft on sx. an obvious question is which type
of string theory are we discussing. indeed, the number of consistent interacting closed
string theories is highly restricted: the obvious candidates are

1. type ii and heterotic strings in 10 dimension.

2. topological strings in all even dimensions.

3. non-abelian strings in 6 dimension.

31

here the last example only recently emerged, and we will return to it in section 7. we

will start with the type ii string.

5.1. the iia superstring in light-cone gauge

the physical states of the ten-dimensional type ii superstring are most conveniently
described in the light-cone green-schwarz formalism. we usually think about the su-
perstring in terms of maps of a riemann surface  into at space-time r1,9. but in
light-cone gauge we make a decomposition r1,1  r8 with corresponding local coordi-
nates (x+, x, xi). the physical degrees of freedom are then completely encoded in the
transverse map

x :   r8.

(5.1)

the model has 16 supercharges (8 left-moving and 8 right-moving) and carries a spin(8)
r-symmetry.

more precisely, apart from the bosonic eld x, we also have fermionic elds that are
dened for a general 8-dimensional transverse space x as follows. let s denote the two
inequivalent 8-dimensional spinor representations of spin(8). we use the same notation
to indicate the corresponding spinor bundles of x. let v denote the vector representation
of spin(8) and let t x be the associated tangent bundle. in this notation we have

x  (k  xt x),

x  (k   xt x).

now the left-moving and right-moving fermions ,  are sections of

  (k 1/2

  xs+),

  (k

1/2

  xs)

(5.2)

(5.3)

the choice of spin structure on  is always ramond or periodic. the dierent choices
of spin(8) representations for the right-moving fermion  (s+ or s) give the distinction
between the iia and iib string. we will work with the iia string for which the represen-
tation of  is chosen to be the conjugate spinor s, but the iib string follows the same
pattern.

with these elds the action of the rst-quantized sigma model is simply the following

free cft

s =z d2 (cid:16) 1

this model has a hilbert space that is of the form

2 xixi + aa + 

a



a(cid:17).

h = l2(r8)  v  f  f .

32

(5.4)

(5.5)

we recognize familiar components: the bosonic zero-mode space l2(r8) describes the

a

quantum mechanics of the center of mass h xi of the string. the fermionic zero-modes
h a, h 

give rise to the 16  16 dimensional vector space of ground states

v = (v  s)  (v  s+)

(5.6)

where the spinor representations should be considered odd. this space forms a represen-
tation of the cliord algebra cli(s+)  cli(s) generated by the fermion zero mode

a =z d

2

a(),

 a =z d

2

a



().

(5.7)

using the triality s+  v  s  s+ of spin(8) this maps to the usual cliord
representation of cli(v ) on s+  s. finally the fock space f of non-zero-modes is
given by

fq =on>0(cid:16)vqns  sqnv(cid:17)
with a similar expression for f with s replaced by s+.
in this light-cone gauge the coordinate x+ is given by

x+(,  ) = p+

(5.8)

(5.9)

for xed longitudinal momentum p+ > 0, whereas x is determined by the constraints

x =

1
p+ (x)2,

x =

1
p+ (x)2.

(5.10)

the hilbert space of physical states of a single string with longitudinal momentum p+ is
given by the cft hilbert space h restricted to states with zero world-sheet momentum,
the level-matching condition

the light-cone energy p is then determined as by the mass-shell relation

p = l0  l0 = 0.

p =

1
p+ (l0 + l0) =

1
p+ h.

(5.11)

(5.12)

one can also consider dlcq with the null coordinate x periodically identied with
radius r. this induced two eects. first, the momentum p+ is quantized as p+ = n/r,

33

n  z>0. second, it allows the string to be wrapped around the compact null direction
giving it a non-trivial winding number

w =zs 1

dx = 2mr,

m  z.

however, using the constraints (5.10) we nd that

w =

2
p+ (l0  l0) =

2r

n

(l0  l0).

(5.13)

(5.14)

so, in order for m to be an integer, we see that the cft hilbert space must now be re-
stricted to the space h(n) consisting of all states that satised the modied level-matching
condition

p = l0  l0 = 0 (mod n)

(5.15)

this is exactly the dention of the hilbert space h(n) in section 3.5. (in the similar spirit
the uncompactied model had hilbert space h().) this motivates us to describe the
second-quantized type iia string in terms of a scft on the orbifold

sn r8 = r8n /sn .

indeed in this correspondence we have:

p+ = n,

p = h = l0 + l0,
w = p = l0  l0.

this gives the following form for the second-quantized fock space

fp =on>0

spnh(n)

(5.16)

(5.17)

(5.18)

(5.19)

where p keeps again track of p+. this is both the hilbert space of the free string theory
and of the orbifold sigma model on spr8. so we can identify their partition functions

z string(r8; p, q, q) = z scf t (spr8; q, q),

(5.20)

34

with

z string(r8; p, q, q) = tr

pp +

qp +w 

qp w 

,

f

z scf t (spr8; q, q) = xn 0

pn tr

h(sn r8)

ql0n/2ql0n/2,

(5.21)

(here we used that the central charge is 12n.)

note that this sigma model is not precisely of the form as we discussed in section 3.
the world-sheet fermions now transform as spinors instead of vectors of spin(8). the
modication that one has to make are however completely straightforward. in particular,
the u(1)s whose quantum numbers gave the world-sheet fermion number fl,r only emerge
if we break spin(8) to su(4)  u(1) = spin(6)  spin(2).
this issue is directly related to compactications. can we consider for the transversal
space instead of r8 a compact calabi-yau four-fold x and make contact with our compu-
tations of the elliptic genus of sx? in the non-linear sigma models of section 3 the fermion
elds where always assumed to take values in the (pull-back of the) tangent bundle to the
target space x, wheras in the green-schwarz string they are sections of spinor bundles.
note however that on a calabi-yau four-fold we have a reduction of the structure group
so(8) to su(4). under this reduction we have the following well-known decomposition
of the three 8-dimensional representations of spin(8) in terms of the representations of
su(4)  u(1) (up to triality)

v  41/2  41/2
s+  41/2  41/2,
s  11  60  11.

(5.22)

so we see that, as far as the su(4) symmetry is concerned, if we only use the s+ rep-
resentation, we could just as well worked with the standard n = 2 scft sigma-model,
since this spinor bundle is isomorphic to the tangent bundle.

this remark picks out naturally the type iib string, whose world-sheet fermions carry
only one spin(8) chirality that we can choose to be s+. so in this formulation only the
type iib light-cone model allows for a full compactications on a calabi-yau four-fold.
this fact is actually well-known. the iia string acquires an anomaly (x)/24 that has
to be cancelled by including some net number of strings [38, 39]. for the type iib string
this translates under a t-duality to a net momentum in the vacuum; we will see this fact
again in a moment. we can also work with only left-moving bps strings that are related
to the elliptic genus of the scft. in that case it does not matter if we choose the iia or
iib strings.

35

5.2. elliptic genera and automorphic forms

if we just want to discuss free strings, without interactions, say in light-cone gauge
without insisting on lorentz-invariance, there are many more possible strings than the ten-
dimensional superstring. in particular we can consider a string whose transverse degrees
of freedom are described by the n = 2 supersymmetric sigma model on the calabi-yau
space x. this string has as its low-energy, massless spectrum the eld theory that consists
of all k-form gauge elds, that we discussed in section 4.3. this is by the way exactly
the eld content of the topological string, that can be dened in any (even) dimension,
but which only has non-vanishing interactions without gravitational descendents in space-
time dimension 6. so this critical case corresponds to choosing a transversal four-fold or
complex surface x. if x has to be compact that restricts us to t 4 or k3. we will return
to this topic in section 7.

therefore another class of free string theories to be considered in the light-cone for-
mulation are the untwisted versions of the topological string, where we do not impose
the usual brst cohomology ql = qr = 0 that reduces the string to its massless elds.
in fact, another interesting case is the half-twisted string (see section 3.3) in which we
only impose qr = 0. for that model we expect to make contact with the elliptic genus.
indeed, in that case there is a straightforward explanation of the automorphic proper-
ties of the elliptic genus of the symmetric product. we recall the main formula (3.20) of
theorem 2, that we now interpret as a partition function of second-quantized bps strings

z string(x; p, q, y) = orb(spx; q, y) = yn>0, m0, 

(1  pnqmy)c(nm,)

(5.23)

with the coecients c(m, ) determined by the elliptic genus of x,

(x; q, y) =xm,

c(m, )qmy.

(5.24)

note that since the strings carry only left-moving excitations, l0 = 0, the space-time
hamiltonian p and winding number w can be identied and thus the partition function
represents the space-time character

z string(x; p, q, y) = tr

(1)f pp +

f

qw 

yf .

(5.25)

this is precisely the object we promised in our discussion to study.

we will parametrize p, q, y as

p = e2i, q = e2i , y2iz,

(5.26)

36

or equivalently by a 2  2 period matrix

 !
 =   z

z

(5.27)

in the siegel upper half-space, det im  > 0. the group sp(4, z) = so(3, 2, z) acts on
the matrix  by fractional linear transformations,   (a + b)(c + d)1.

now the claim is that the string partition function orb(x : p, q, y) is almost equal
to an automorphic form for the group so(3, 2, z), of the innite product type as appear
in the work of borcherds [35]. this is just the string theory generalization of the fact
that the euler number orb(spx) is almost a modular form of sl(2, z).
in fact, the
euler number is obtained from the elliptic genus in the limit y  1, z  0, where the
q-dependence disappears. in this case, the automorphic group degenerates as

sp(4, z)  sl(2, z)  sl(2, z)

(5.28)

where only the rst sl(2, z) factor acts non-trivially on p.

the precise form of the corrections needed to get a true automorphic function (p, q, y)
for a general calabi-yau d-fold x has been worked out in detail in [26]. it is dened by
the product

(p, q, y) = paqbyc y(n,m,)>0

(1  pnqmy)c(nm,)

(5.29)

where the positivity condition means: n, m  0 with  > 0 in the case n = m = 0. the
weyl vector (a, b, c) is dened by

a = b = (x)/24,

||

4

c =x

c(0, ).

here the coecients c(0, ) are the partial euler numbers

c(0, r 

d
2

) =xs

(1)s+rhr,s

(5.30)

(5.31)

one can then show that  is an automorphic form of weight c(0, 0)/2 for the group
o(3, 2, z) for a suitable quadratic form of signature (3, 2).

the form  follows actually from a standard one-loop string amplitude dened as
an integral over the fundamental domain [36, 27]. the integrand consists of the genus
one partition function of the string on x  t 2 and has a manifest so(3, 2, z) t-duality

37

invariance. the so(3, 2, z) appears in the following way. first of all, as explained in the
introduction, strings on t 2 have two quantized momenta and two winding numbers, giving
the narain lattice 2,2. for a transversal calabi-yau space, there are also the left-moving
and right-moving fermi numbers fl, fr. since we restrict to right-moving ground states
in the elliptic genus, only fl gives another integer conserved quantum number . adding
this charge to the narain lattice enlarges it to 3,2. moreover, it allows us to extend the
moduli ,  of the two-torus by another complex parameter z that couples to fl = .
technically, z has an interpretation as a wilson loop that parametrizes the u(1)l bundle
over t 2. together, ,  , z parametrize the lattice 3,2; they can be considered as a point
on the symmetric space

so(3, 2)/so(3)  so(2) = h2,1.

(5.32)

now the strategy is to compute the string partition function through a one-loop amplitude

z string(x; p, q, y) = exp f string(x; p, q, y).

(5.33)

note that f string is the partition function for maps from the world-sheet elliptic curve,
with a modulus that we denote as  , to the space-time that contains an elliptic curve
with modulus  ,

it is easily to confuse the two elliptic curves! one now computes an integral over the
fundamental domain of the world-sheet modulus   that has the form

   t 2
t 2

,,z  x.

(5.34)

f string =

2 +1 d

2 x(pl, pr)  3,2

n  2dz  2



ei( p2

r)c(n)ein /d

(5.35)



where the notation 3,2
indicates that  =  (mod 2d) and where the coecients c(n)
are dened in terms of the expansion coecients of the elliptic genus of x as c(m, ) =
c(2dm  2), with  =  (mod 2d). this integral can be computed using the by-now
standard techniques of [40, 36, 27, 28]. the nal result of the integration is [26],

f string(, ) =  log(cid:0)(det im )c(0,0)/2|()|2(cid:1)

(5.36)

since the integral f is by construction invariant under the t-duality group o(3, 2, z),
this determines the automorphic properties of . the factor det im  transforms with
weight 1, which xes the weight of the form  to be c(0, 0)/2. this formula should be

38

contrasted with the analogous computation for the zero-modes (4.8), i.e., the eld theory
limit,

f qf t (,  ) =  log(cid:0)(im  )c/2|c( )|2(cid:1) ,

c = (x).

(5.37)

in the special case of k3 the innite product () is a well-known automorphic form
[41], see also [42, 43]. first of all, the elliptic genus of k3 is the unique (up to a scalar)
weak jacobi form of weight 0 and index 1. realizing k3 as a kummer surface (resolving
the orbifold t 4/z2) we see that the elliptic genus can be written in terms of genus one
theta-functions as

(k3; p, q) = 23 xeven 

2
(z;  )
2
a(0,  )

.

(5.38)

if we now identify  with the period matrix of a genus two riemann surface, we can
rewrite the automorphic form in terms of genus two theta-functions,

() = 212 yeven 

[]()2

(5.39)

in the work of gritsenko and nikulin [41] is is shown that  also has an interpretation as
the denominator of a generalized kac-moody algebra. it is a rather obvious conjecture
that this gkm should be given by the algebra of bps states induced by the string
interaction. the full story for k3 is quite beautiful and explained in [28]. see [44, 45] for
more on the connection with gkms.

summarizing we have seen the following:

1. the (bps) string theory partition function factorizes in left-moving and right-

moving contributions that are holomorphic functions of the moduli p, q, y.

2. the holomorphic contributions are automorpic forms of weight c(0, 0)/2 of the
group so(3, 2, z) if a particular correction is added. this correction takes the form

(pq)(x)/24ycy>0

(1  y)c(0,) ym>0,

(1  qmy)c(m,)

(5.40)

these three factors have the following interpretation. the rst factor is again the
regulated zero-point energy, very similar to the eld theory result. the second factor
is due to the bosonic and fermionic zero-modes. (recall that the low-energy eld
theory describes general dierential forms on t 2  x.) the third factor is there to
restore the symmetry in p and q. it can only be understood using t -duality.

3. the full partition function is invariant because the zero-mode contribution adds a

non-holomorphic factor (det im )c(0,0)/2.

39

4. the holomorphic contributions are characters of an innite-dimensional generalized
kac-moody algebra, directly related to the creation and annihilation operators of
the string fock space and their interactions.

5. the modularity of the characters, i.e., the transformation properties under the
automorphic group so(3, 2, z) is explained by the relation to a partition function
of a string on a two-torus t 2 with an associated line bundle with moduli , , z and
t -duality group so(3, 2, z).

6. matrix strings and interactions

up to now we have only considered free theories and observed how in light-cone quan-
tization these models could be reformulated using rst-quantized theories on symmetric
products. now we want to atke advantage from this relation to include interactions. this
has proven possible for two important examples: 1) the ten-dimensional iia superstring
and some of its compactications, and 2) the class of (2,0) supersymmetric six-dimensional
non-abelian string theories. by taking the low-energy limit, similar formulations for the
eld theory limits follow. the essential starting point in these constructions is the beau-
tiful ansatz for a non-perturbative formulation of m-theory known as matrix theory [5].
see for example the reviews [8, 7, 9] for more information about matrix theory.

6.1. supersymmetric yang-mills theory

matrix string theory gives a very simple ansatz of what non-perturbative iia string
theory looks like in light-cone gauge [12, 13, 11].
it is simply given by the maximally
supersymmetric two-dimensional yang-mills theory with gauge group u(n) in the limit
n   (or with nite n in dlcq).

to be more precise, let us consider two-dimensional u(n) sym theory with 16 su-
percharges. it can be obtained by dimensionally reducing the n = 1 sym theory in 10
dimensions. its eld content consists of the following elds. first we pick a (necessarily
trivial) u(n) principle bundle p on the world-sheet s1  r. let a be a connection on
this bundle. we further have 8 scalar eld x i in the vector representation v of spin(8),
and 8 left-moving fermions a in the spinor representation s+ and 8 right-moving fermion
a
in the conjugated spinor representation s. all these elds are hermitean n  n

matrices, or if one wishes sections of the adjoint bundle ad(p ) .

the action for the sym theory reads

ssy m = z d2 tr(cid:16) 1

2|dx i|2 + ada +

40

+

1

2g2|fa|2 + g2xi<j

[x i, x j]2 + g 

a

i

a a[x i, a](cid:17)

(6.1)

here g is the sym coupling constant - a dimensionful quantity with dimension 1/length
in two dimensions. this means in particular that the sym model is not conformal invari-
ant. in fact, at large length scales (in the ir) the model becomes strongly interacting. so
we have a one-parameter family of qfts labeled by the coupling constant g or equiva-
lently a length scale  = 1/g.

the relation with string theory is the following. first of all for nite n the hilbert
space of states of the sym theory should be identied with the dlcq second-quantized
iia string hilbert space. the integer n that gives the rank of the gauge group is then
related to the total longitudinal momentum in the usual way as

p+ = n/r,

whereas the total light-cone energy is given by

p =

n
p+ hsy m

(6.2)

(6.3)

with hsy m the hamiltonian of the sym model. note that in the decompactication of
the null circle where we will take n, r  , keeping their ratio nite, only sym states
with energy

hsy m 

1
n

(6.4)

will contribute a nite amount to p. finally, the iia string coupling constant gs (a
dimensionless constant) is identied as

gs = (gs)1

(6.5)

with s the string length,  = 2
s.

from this identication we see that free string theory (gs = 0) is recovered at strong
sym coupling (g = ). this is equivalent to the statement that free string theory is
obtained in the ir limit.
in this scaling limitthe xed point of the renormalization
group owwe expect on general grounds to recover a superconformal eld theory with
16 supercharges. we will now argue that this scft is the supersymmetric sigma model
with target space sn r8. we can then use our previous analysis of orbifold sigma models
to conclude that the point gs = 0 indeed describes the second-quantized free iia string.

41

the analysis proceeds in two steps. first we observe that because of the last two terms
in the action (6.1), in the limit gs = 0 which is equivalent to g = , the elds x and 
necessarily have to commute. this means that we can write the matrix coordinates as

x i() = u()  xi()  u 1(),

(6.6)

with u  u(n) and xi a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues xi
n . now the matrix
valued elds x i() are single-valued, being section of the trivial bundle u(n) vector
ad(p ). but this does not imply that the elds u() and xi() are too.
in fact, it
is possible that after a shift    + 2 the individual eigenvalues are permuted due
to a spectral ow. only the set of eigenvalues (or more properly the set of common
eigenstates) of the commuting matrices x i is a gauge invariant quantity. so we should
allow for congurations of the form

1, . . . , xi

xi( + 2) = g  xi()  g1,

(6.7)

with g  sn the weyl group of u(n). eectively this tells us that we are dealing with
an orbifold with target space

r8n /sn = sn r8,

(6.8)

given lie-theoretically as t8/w with t the cartan lie algebra and w the weyl group of
u(n).

as we have analyzed before this implies that the hilbert space decomposes in su-
perselection sectors labeled by the conjugacy classes [g] of sn , which in turn are given
by partitions of n. this structure indicates that the hilbert space is a fock space of
second-quantized iia strings. a sector twisted by

g = (n1) . . . (nk)

(6.9)

describes k strings of longitudinal momentum

p+
i =

ni
r

=

ni
n

p+
tot,

i = 1, . . . , k.

(6.10)

we have also seen how for a string with a twist (n) of length n the zn projection of the
orbifold projects the hilbert space to a subsector conditioned to

l0  l0 = 0 (mod n)

(6.11)

42

that we now interpreted as the usual dlcq level-matching condition.
limit, also the individual ni go to innity, eectively decompactifying the null circle.

in the large n

the second step consists of analyzing the behaviour of the gauge eld. the possibly
twisted congurations of x i() break the gauge group u(n) to an abelian subgroup t
that commutes with the conguration x i(). in fact, if the twist sector is labeled by a
partition

describing k strings of length n1, . . . , nk, the unbroken gauge group is

n1 + . . . + nk = n

t = u(1)k.

(6.12)

(6.13)

because of the higgs eect all the broken components of the gauge eld acquire masses
of the order g and thus decouple in the ir limit. this leaves us with a free abelian gauge
theory on r  s1. this model has been analyzed in great detail. dividing by the gauge
symmetries leaves us with the holonomy along the s1

hol(a) = ehs1 a  t

(6.14)

as the only physical degree of freedom. the gauge theory is therefore described by the
quantum mechanics on the torus t with hamiltonian given by

h = g2

(6.15)

with  the laplacian on t . the eigenstates are given by the characters of the irreducible
representations of t with eigenvalues (energies) g2 times the second casimir invariant
of the representation. clearly in the limit g   only the vacuum state or trivial
representation survives. this state has a constant wavefunction on t which has the
interpretation that the abelian gauge eld is free to uctuate, a result from the fact that
in strong coupling the action s = 1
only contributes a single vacuum state. this completes our heuristic derivation of the ir
limit of sym.

g2 r f 2 goes to zero. so all-in-all the gauge eld sector

since two-dimensional gauge theories are so well-behaved it would be interesting to
make the above in a completely rigorous statement about the ir xed point of sym. one
of the points of concern could be complications that emerge if some of the eigenvalues
coincide.
in that case unbroken non-abelian symmetries appear. as we will show in
the next section however, from the scft perspective such eects are always irrelevant
and thus disappear in the ir limit. in fcat, these eects are exactly responsible for the
perturbative interactions at nite g.

43

6.2. interactions

if the matrix string theory conjecture is correct, for nite coupling constant the sym
theory should reproduce the interacting string. a non-trivial check of this conjecture is
to identify the correction for small gs. this should be given by the joining and splitting
interaction of the strings, producing surfaces with nontrivial topology.

this computation was done in [11] where the leading correction was computed. let us
try to summarize this computation. (it is also reviewed in [9].) the idea is to analyze the
behaviour of the sym theory in the neighbourhood of the ir xed point. in leading order,
a deformation to nite g, is given by the least irrelevant operator in the orbifold cft. that
is, we look for the operator o in the sigma model that preserves all the supersymmetries
and the spin(8) r-symmetry and that has the smallest scaling dimensions. the deformed
qft then has an action of the form

s = sscf t + (gs)h2z o + . . .

(6.16)

with h the toal scaling dimension of o. we would like to see that the power of gs is one (so
that h = 3) and that this deformation induces the usual joining and splitting interaction.
note that the hilbert space of the matrix string was dened with ramond boundary

conditions for the supercurrent g a = a a

i axi. that is, we have

g a( + 2) = g a().

(6.17)

we have seen that the ground state space v (n) of a zn twisted sector h(n) is isomorphic
to the ground state space of a single string

v (n) = (v  s)  (v  s+).

only the conformal dimensions are rescaled and given by

l0 = l0 = nd/8,

(6.18)

(6.19)

since the central charge of the scft is n times as big. here d was the complex dimension
of the target space, so in our case d = 4.

one way to understand this vacuum degeneracy is that zn action on the n fermions
1, . . . , n can be diagonalized with eigenvalues e2ik/n, k = 0, . . . , n  1. that is, there
are linear combinations of the k, let us denote them by k that have boundary conditions

k( + 2) = e

2ik

n k().

(6.20)

44

so the linear sum

0 = 1 + . . . + n

(6.21)

is always periodic and its zero modes give the 16 fold vacuum degeneracy. a similar story
holds for the right-moving fermions.

since we want to keep ramond boundary conditions in the interacting theory, the
local operator o that describes the rst-order deformation should be in the ns-sector.
this just tells us that the ope

g a(z)o(w)

(6.22)

is single-valued in z  w. so, using the familiar operator-state correspondence of cft
we have to look in the ns-sector of the hilbert space. these are of course again labeled
by twist elds. the only dierence is that the fermions now have an extra minus sign in
their monodromy, and satisfy the boundary conditions

k( + 2) = e

2ik

n k.

(6.23)

now depending on whether n is even or odd there is a periodic fermion or not. so we
expect to nd only a degeneracy for even n. it is not dicult to compute the conformal
dimension of the ns ground state in a zn twisted sector. first of all, both for the bosons
and fermions the zn action can be diagonalized. the bosonic twist eld that implements a
twist with eigenvalue e2ik/n has conformal dimensions dk(n k)/2n2, with d the complex
dimension of the transversal space (d = 4 for the iia string). for the corresponding
fermionic twist eld we nd conformal dimension dm2/2n2, where m = min(k, n  k).
adding up all the possible eigenvalues we obtain total conformal dimension

h =( n,
n  1

n even,

n, n odd.

(6.24)

in particular the lowest dimension h = 2 is given by the z2 twist eld . since n = 2 is
even, this ground state has the usual degeneracy

  (v  s)  (v  s+)

(6.25)

note that the zero-modes of the superpartner of the twisted boson xi give this degeneracy.
however, the ns ground state is not supersymmetric neither spin(8) invariant, and is
therefore not a suitable candidate for our operator o.

45

there is however a small modication that does respect the supersymmetry algebra.

in the z2 twisted sector the coordinate xi has a mode expansion

xi = xnz+ 1

2

nzn1.
i

we now consider the rst excited state

o = i

1/2j

1/2ij

(6.26)

(6.27)

of conformal weights 2 + 1 = 3. (here ij indicates the components of  in v  v . this
operator can be written as

and therefore satises

o = g a

1/2g

b
1/2 ab

[g a

1/2,o] = g

b
1/2 ab

(6.28)

(6.29)

which is sucient. since o is both susy and spin() invariant, it is the leading irrelevant
operator that we were looking for.

what is the interpretation of the eld o in string perturbation theory? it clearly maps
superselection sectors with two strings into sectors with one string and vice versa. it is
therefore exactly the usual joining and splitting interaction. in fact, the perturbation in
the operator o reproduces the standard light-cone perturbation theory.
there is also a clear geometric interpretation of the twist eld interaction o. consider
the manifold r8/z2 or if one wishes the compact version t 8/z2. this is a calabi-yau
orbifold and denes a perfectly well-behaved superconformal sigma model. one could now
try to blow-up the z2 singularity to obtain a smooth calabi-yau space. it is well-known
that this cannot be done without destroying the calabi-yau property; the orbifold r8/z2
is rigid. in the scft language this is expressed by the fact that corresponding deformation
does not respect the superconformal algebra. algebraically, preserving the conformal
invariance implies that the operator is marginal with scaling dimension 2. the fact that
we found weight 3 is therefore in accordance with the fact that the two-dimensional eld
theory deforms to a massive eld theory with a length scale  two-dimensional sym.

however, we see that if the transverse target space would have been four-dimensional,
the twist eld interaction would have l0 = l0 = 1 and would have represented a marginal
operator. this is a simple reection of the fact that the orbifold r4/z2 or t 4/z2 can
be resolved to a smooth calabi-yau manifold, respectively an hyperkahler ale space or
a k3 surface. we therefore turn now to the case where this four-dimensional example
becomes relevant.

46

7. string theories in six dimensions

for superstrings the critical dimension is ten, or transversal dimension eight. however,
in the past year that has been growing evidence that there is also a fascinating class of
string theories with critical dimension six, with a four-dimensional transversal space. in
fact, there is believed to be such a string for every simply-laced lie group of type a, d, e.
we will mainly focus on the u(k) case.

there is very little know about these theories [46, 48, 47]. they have (2, 0) super-
symmetry with a spin(4) r-symmetry, do not contain a graviton, and give non-trivial
six-dimensional scfts in the ir, where the r-symmetry is enlarged to spin(5) = sp(2).
roughly their massless modes should be a theory of non-abelian two-form gauge elds,
whose three-form eld strength is self-dual. for the u(1) theory this can be made pre-
cise. the massless modes form the irreducible (2,0) tensor multiplet which consists of one
two-form b together with ve scalar eld x i.

furthermore the string coupling of these microstrings or little strings is believed to
be xed to one (basically because of the self-duality). since the string coupling cannot
be tuned to zero, there is no reason why a free string spectrum should emerge. this
good, because we know that the six-dimensional green-schwarz superstring is not lorentz
invariant. it is true however that this string does reproduce the tensor multiplet as its
massless sector.

7.1. dlcq formulations and matrix models

up to now we only know how to describe these (2,0) strings in a matrix theory dlcq

formulation [14, 49, 50, 51]. we choose a six-dimensional space-time of the form

m 1,5 = (r  s1)1,1  x 4

(7.1)

with x a (ricci at) riemannian four-manifold. we will often choose x to be compact,
which restricts us to either t 4 or k3. we x the longitudinal momentum to be p+ = n/r,
with r the radius of the null-circle. the claim is now that this string theory can be
described in terms of a two-dimensional sigma model with target space the moduli space

mk,n (x)

(7.2)

of u(k) instantons (self-dual connections) on x with total instanton charge ch2 = n.
this moduli space is a hyperkahler manifold of real dimension 4nk. it has singularities,
corresponding to (colliding) point-like instantons. there is however a particularly nice
compactication by considering the moduli space

mk,n (x)

47

(7.3)

of (equivalence classes) of coherent torsion free sheaves of rank k and ch2 = n.
in
particular for the case k = 1 we nd in this way the hilbert scheme of dimension zero
subschemes of length n

m1,n (x) = hilbn (x).

(7.4)

this space is a intricate smooth resolution of the symmetric space sn x [52]. the bers of
the projection hilbn (x)  sn x over the various diagonals keep track of the particular
way the points approach each other. quite generally, if x is a smooth calabi-yau space
of complex dimension d then the symmetric product snx is also calabi-yau manifold,
albeit an orbifold, now of dimension nd. only for (complex) dimension two, i.e., if x
a four-torus or k3 surface, is it possible to resolve the singularities of snx to produce
smooth calabi-yau. the hilbert scheme hilbn (x) provides a canonical construction. for
cy d-folds with d  3 the hilbert scheme is not smooth.
we should mention here that all of the spaces mk,n are to be hyperkahler deformations
of sn kx. in particular this implies that their cohomology is given by that of the symmetric
product. for more on this issue see [53].

7.2. deformations and interactions

for any calabi-yau space x, its deformation space is locally given by h 1(tx) =
h 1,d1(x). by a well-know result of tian and todorov there are no obstructions to
such deformations, and therefore the dimension of the moduli space mx of inequivalent
complex structures is given by h1,d1(x). it is not dicult to compute the dimension
of the deformation space of the symmetric product snx using the above formalism. we
see that there is always a contribution given by h 1(tx). this corresponds to simply
deforming the underlying manifold x. however, for dimension d = 2 and only for this
dimension, there is a second contribution coming from h 0(x (2)). in fact, for d = 2 we
have

dimmsnx = dimmx + 1.

(7.5)

there is a direct geometric interpretation of this extra deformation. x (2) represents the
small diagonal in x n where two points coincide. in the orbifold cohomology of snx it
contributes the cohomology of x, shifted however in bi-degree by (d  1, d  1) = (1, 1).
the corresponding deformation corresponds to blowing up in the given complex structure
this small diagonal.

the corresponding operator in the scft is exactly the same z2 twist eld that we
have discussed before for the type ii string. therefore this deformation can be given an
interpretation as tuning the string coupling constant [53].
