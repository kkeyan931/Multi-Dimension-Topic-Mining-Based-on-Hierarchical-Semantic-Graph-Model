abstract

we study the kaluza-klein electric dipole solution in ve dimen-
sions. by taking an appropriate limit, the solution approaches ve
dimensional pp-waves, which are electrically charged black holes in
four dimensions. the extension to the d0  anti-d0 solution in
m-theory is briey discussed.

the kaluza-klein monopole [1, 2] has received a renewed interest in recent
years. it is a solution of the ve-dimensional vacuum einstein equation and
describes a monopole of the kaluza-klein u(1) gauge eld after the reduction
to four dimensions. the solution when embedded in ten dimensions describes
a 5-brane solution 1 in type ii theories which is t-dual to the ns 5-branes.
also, the solution when embedded in eleven dimensions describes a 6-brane
solution in m-theory which reduces to the d6-brane in type iia theory.
for recent discussions of kaluza-klein monopoles in string theory and in
m-theory, see refs. [3]-[6].

the solution is constructed by taking the product of a at time and a four
dimensional euclidean einstein solution. choosing the self-dual euclidean
taub-nut solution gives rise to the kaluza-klein monopole. this procedure
can be applied to the other congurations as well. for example, choosing the
euclidean kerr solution represents the kaluza-klein magnetic dipoles [1, 4].
the solution can be interpreted as a brane  antibrane pair. for recent
discussions of brane  antibrane pairs in string theory, see ref. [7].

in this paper, we discuss the ve dimensional kaluza-klein electric dipole
solution. the solution represents pp-waves (plane fronted waves with parallel
rays) [8] in ve dimensions.
in four dimensions, the dipole solution can
be interpreted as the static electrically charged black holes with opposite
charges, suspended in an external electric eld. unfortunately, the solution
has no easy generalization to higher dimensions, so we were not able to obtain
the most interesting casethe d0  anti-d0 conguration in m-theory.

the solution is

where

1we put quotes because the solution has one less goldstone modes naively expected

for 5-branes [3].

here, m and a are parameters labeling the solution. 2 this solves the ve-
dimensional vacuum einstein equation. the solution is singular at (r =
r0,  = 0) and (r = r0,  = ), where (r0) = 0 or
r0 = m + m2 + a2.

(3)

this contrasts with the kaluza-klein magnetic dipole, where the embedded
solution is non-singular even though the d = 4 solution is singular.

the ve dimensional variables and the four dimensional variables are

related by

ds2

5 = e2/3ge

dxdx + e4/3(dx4 + 2adx)2.

(4)

here, ,  run over 0, . . . , 3 and we have used the einstein metric. then, the
ve-dimensional einstein action is equivalent to

s =

16g4 z d4xg{r  2()2  e23f 2}.

(5)

the solution (1) can be obtained using the four-dimensional electromagnetic
duality transformation, f  f  1

, from the kaluza-klein magnetic dipole.

the solution in terms of the einstein metric is again singular at (r =
r0,  = 0) and (r = r0,  = ). the mass can be determined by the asymptotic
form of (1):

m =

m
2g4

,

(6)

(7)

where g4 is the d = 4 newtons constant. the vector potential is

a0 = 

ma cos 

2

 

ma cos 

r2

for large r. this is the eld of an electric dipole, located at the origin, of
strength ma pointing along the z axis.

we will now show that the solution (1) corresponds to a pp-wave  anti-

pp-wave pair. following sen, we introduce a new set of coordinates:
2(r  r0) = (1 + cos ).

(r0  m) sin2  = (1  cos ),

2note the parameter m is not the mass of the solution. we use m for the mass.

(8)

then, focus on the region near (r = r0,  = 0) and take the a   limit
keeping (r  r0, a) nite. in this limit, the metric (1) reduces to

5 = f 1dt2 + f{dx4  (1  f 1)dt}2 + d2 + 2(d2 + sin2 d2),
ds2

(9)

where f = 1+m/. this is the metric of an anti-pp-wave [8]. similar analysis
can be carried out near (r = r0,  = ).

the pp-waves in ve dimensions become the electrically charged black
holes 0-branes of mass m = m/(4g4) in four dimensions. thus, the solu-
tion (1) describes a 0-brane  anti-0-brane pair in four dimensions. the dis-
tance between the 0-brane and the anti-0-brane is dened to be the geodesic
distance between the points (r0,  = 0) and (r0,  = ) in the d = 4 einstein
metric. this is given by

0 r2q1  2mr/2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r=r0
l = z 
= az 

sin (r2

0

d

0  a2 cos2 )1/4d  2a

for

a  m.

(10)

note that l = 0 when a = 0.

in ref. [4], the distance between branes is dened by the geodesic distance
in the embedded metric (eq.(17) of ref. [4]). however, for the magnetic
dipole, the separation by the embedded metric remains nite even for a = 0
and this makes it hard to interpret the a = 0 solution. when a = 0, the
conguration could be interpreted as a coincident brane  anti-brane as we
will see. so, it seems more appropriate using the geodesic distance by the
metric after the reduction; the separation by the reduced metric becomes zero
when a = 0. (note that the separation is given by eq. (10) for the magnetic
dipole as well due to the electromagnetic duality.) of course, the denition
of d = 4 geodesic distance is somewhat ambiguous since it depends on the
frame and is not conformally invariant. anyway, the problem of ref. [4] does
not arise for the electric dipole. one can use the geodesic distance in the
embedded metric; it is also zero when a = 0.

in an appropriate coordinate system, the electric dipole is suspended in
an external electric eld just like the magnetic dipole. this is the reason

3

why we get the static conguration. one way to see this is to make use of
the electromagnetic duality. for the euclidean kerr solution, the standard
boyet-lindquist coordinates do not represent independent angular coordi-
nates [4]. the electric dipole (1) is obtained by dualizing with respect to
the boyet-lindquist coordinates. choosing independent angular coordinates
(x4, ) and dualizing the magnetic dipole solution, one obtains the electric
eld. the electric eld on z-axis is given by

e = 2(  )  

m
2a2

for a  m.

(11)

(see the ref. [4] for denitions of  and .)

when the brane separation a = 0, the metric has no g04 component

showing that the solution has zero electric eld:

ds2

5 = (1 

2m
r

)dt2 + (1 

2m
r

)1(dx4)2 + dr2 + r(r  2m)d2
2.

(12)

the solution is singular at r = 2m. we interpret this conguration as a
coincident pp-wave  anti-pp-wave pair.

in four dimensions, the solution (12) is a spherically symmetric solution
with non-trivial scalar eld. however, there is no violation of the no-hair
theorems [9]: the no-hair theorems state that the only black hole solutions of
the einstein-scalar eld theory are schwarzschild with the vanishing scalar
eld.
in terms of the four dimensional variables, the scalar  is actually
singular at the singular horizon r = 2m:

e4/3 = (1 

2m
r

)1,

(13)

whereas the standard no-hair theorems assume that the scalar eld is non-
singular at the horizon.

the proof by bekenstein uses the fact that the volume integral of a pos-
itive denite function which is made from scalar elds is equal to surface
integrals at the horizon and at asymptotic innity. the surface integral at
innity vanishes for asymptotically at solutions. the surface integral at the
horizon vanishes for the scalar elds bounded on the horizon. therefore, the

4

volume integral has to vanish and the only way is for the scalar elds to van-
ish identically. however, if the scalar elds are not bounded on the horizon,
the surface integral at the horizon does not have to vanish; therefore, the
scalar elds do not vanish in general.

in fact, one can construct a two-parameter family of spherically symmetric

solutions in d-dimensions:

ds2

d+1 =   1  (r0/r)

1 + (r0/r)!2/

1 + (r0/r)!2/
dt2 +  1  (r0/r)
1 + (r0/r)!2(1)/()

r0
r

(dxd)2

(14)

(dr2 + r2d2

d2),

where

 = d  3,

 = s2 +

2


+ 1.

(15)

this is the (d+1)-dimensional generalization of the ve-dimensional solution
[1]. upon reduction to d-dimensions, this describes a family of spherically
symmetric solutions labeled by (m, ). when  = 0,  = 1, the solution
describes the schwarzschild solution times a at space. when  =  = ,
the solution describes the euclidean schwarzschild solution times a at time
(or the coincident kaluza-klein magnetic dipoles). the coincident electric
dipole corresponds to  = 1,  = 1.

the solution is non-singular only if  =  = ; the  = 0,  = 1 solution
is singular at r = 0 and the others are singular at r = r0. the mass can be
determined either by the asymptotic form of (14) in (d + 1)-dimensions or
by the asymptotic form of the d-dimensional einstein metric. it is given by

(16)

where gd is the d-dimensional newtons constant and n is the volume of
the unit sn,  = 2
2 ). for the electric and the magnetic dipoles,
r0 = m/2, so m = r0/g4 = m/(2g4).
incidentally, the above family of
solutions contains a massless solution since m = 0 for  = 2  d.

the electric dipole solution has no easy generalization to higher dimen-
sions. thus, we were not able to obtain the d0  anti-d0 solution in m-
theory. the kaluza-klein monopole and the magnetic dipole solution are
easily generalized to 11 dimensions because the directions parallel to the
branes are at. likewise, the pp-wave solution can be generalized to 11 di-
mensions because the transverse directions are at. however, as can be seen
from (1) and (12), all spacetime directions are curved for the electric dipole
solution. so, one really has to solve the 11-dimensional einstein equation in
order to obtain the d0  anti-d0 solution in m-theory.

note added. after this work was completed, we received a preprint by b.
janssen and s. mukherji [10] in which brane  antibrane solutions are also
discussed.
