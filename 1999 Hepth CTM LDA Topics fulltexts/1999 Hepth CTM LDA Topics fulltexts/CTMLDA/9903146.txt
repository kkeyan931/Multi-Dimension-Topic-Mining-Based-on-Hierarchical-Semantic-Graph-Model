(2.1) gives lower bound clock mass given x. (2.1), need clocks larger mass construct ner coordinate system. however also maximum value clock mass, clock become black hole. measure gravitational eld, possible interchange light particles among clocks. thus schwarzschild radius exceed uncertainty x clock: clock mass chosen arbitrary satises (2.1) (2.2). thus condition existence clock mass gm . x. (2.2) gt . (x)3. (2.3) since cannot construct appropriate coordinate system unless inequality (2.3) satised, would natural propose inequality (2.3) property 3 space-time x denoting time scale spatial uncertainty space-time, respectively. regarding (x)3 volume associated clock, (2.3) would rewritten form gt . v, (2.4) v denotes volume uncertainty. aw derivation neglected dynamical eect caused gravitational eld generated clocks. one easily nds (2.1) coordinate system destroyed much shorter time gravitational eects among clocks quantum eects. justify neglecting eect, consider case distances among clocks much larger neness x. case, neness x represents uncertainty coordinate associated clock. unusual point inequality (2.3) minimal spatial length x positive correlation time interval . although seems left-hand side (2.3) made arbitrarily small, cannot detect arbitrarily small spatial length scale. show this, let us suppose test particle injected system detect structure length scale x system collision experiment. since speed particle smaller speed light, collision experiment needs time longer x. thus, (2.3), gx < gt . (x)3, (2.5) dictates minimal length detectable indeed planck length g. take time scale large, inequality (2.3) tells us quite unusual thing space-time. time scale diverges, neness x also diverges. means space-time innite characteristic time scale vanishing density degrees freedom. use property discussion cosmological constant problem 5. (2.4), would natural propose fundamental degree freedom quantum gravity associated nite spatial volume determined v = cbtgt, (2.6) cbt numerical constant. discuss value constant 5, time simply leave undetermined. call fundamental space-time region space-time bit paper. 4 3. number bits region given energy section, discuss maximal number space-time bits spatial region total volume v total energy e, give formula entropy associated region. suppose spatial region composed bits labeled integer = 1, , n. assume total spatial volume v partitioned bits v = vi. n xi=1 (3.1) use uncertainty inequality energy, e /t . assume also total energy partitioned bits. e = n xi=1 ei &  ti n xi=1 g2 vi . n xi=1 (3.2) last relation, used (2.6). constraint (3.1), quantitypn (3.2) takes minimum value volume bit, vi, takes value v /n. thus obtain inequality g2 vi i=1 reason believe maximum value number bits region agrees entropy associated it. however, appendix, give discussion illustrates right-hand side (3.4) fact approximately proportional entropy:) c0 proportionality factor constant leading approximation. s(e, v ) c0r ev g2 , (3.5) right-hand side (3.4) becomes per3/g2 system characteristic scale r. thus equation (3.4) extra factor pr/eg, compared so-called bekenstein entropy bound er/. 2), 3) case schwarzschild bound ge < r satised, bound (3.4) larger bekenstein entropy bound. thus (3.4) distinct bekenstein entropy bound contradict it. case ge > r, entropy formula (3.5) gives value smaller bekenstein bound. plays important role explaining entropy universe 5. ) entropy paper dimensionless. 5 e & g2n 2 , v n .r ev g2 .

(5.1) np r3 p lp (cid:19)3 vp (cid:18)rp , (5.2) rp denotes size observable part universe planckian time. thus, using (3.5) e np /tp , obtain entropy universe su np v lp (cid:19)3 tpg np (cid:18)rp 1090. (5.3) used rp 1030lp obtained friedman-robertson-walker (frw) cosmological model epoch matter-radiation density equality teq 1011 sec. value (5.3) near entropy obtained 2.7 k cosmic microwave background. value (5.3) entropy universe recently discussed point view cosmic holographic principle, 6) - 8) fischler susskind 6) shown cosmic holographic principle gives bound expansion rate translated bound equation state. bound saturated incompressible perfect uid, discussed 4. obtain bound imposing second law thermodynamics, namely entropy universe decrease time. show this, let us assume a(t) tp, a(t) scale factor frw metric. then, v (t) (2.6) v (t) t3p. thus, similar argument used deriving (5.3), nd behavior entropy described s(t) n(t) t3p1. thus, second law satised, must 1 3 , p (5.4) (5.5) translated bound 1 equation state p = . relations generalized second law cosmic holographic principle discussed ref. 8). discussed 2, notion space-time bit seems seriously contradict classical notion (3+1)-dimensional space-time, range time innite. suggests 7 space-time volume operator r d4xg exist quantum gravity. since cosmological constant coupling constant associated operator, suggestion indicates cannot introduce cosmological constant quantum gravity. however, universe innite range time, expect term analogous cosmological constant. estimate follows. choose age universe tu characteristic time scale. then, (2.6), volume space-time bit universe vu cbtgtu . (5.6) bit energy /tu , uncertainty relation. thus energy density universe originating space-time obtained st  tu vu 1 cbtgt 2 u . (5.7) order critical density c = 3h 2/8g, h hubble constant, might large enough change signicantly evolution scenario universe. give argument estimate numerical constant cbt (2.6). let us consider frw cosmological model vanishing spatial curvature, and, matter, consider perfect uid thermodynamic property given 4. conservation law stress-energy tensor, + 3( + p ) a/a = 0, determines density = c a6 , (5.8) c numerical constant. substituting (5.8) evolution equation 3 a2/a2 = 8g, obtain a3 = 24gct, hence = 1 24gt2 . (5.9) since general relativity gives perfect description, least macroscopic object, would natural demand result (5.9) agree (5.7) tu = t. moreover, since a(t) t1/3, evolution adiabatic process, seen (5.4), consistent conservation stress-energy tensor used derivation (5.8). thus obtain cbt 24. (5.10) important comment perfect uid thermodynamic properties section 4 fully represent properties space-time bits. example 8 frw model spatial curvature, let us consider case exists dust. since energy density dust behaves 1/a3 decreases slowly (5.8), evolution universe dominated dust suciently long time. scale factor behaves t2/3 regime, and, substituting (5.8), obtain 1/t4. contradicts (5.7), derived simply uncertainty relation energy time. propose thermodynamic properties change somehow regime (5.7) correct answer. substituting (5.10) (5.7), ratio energy density originating space-time critical density becomes st = st c 1 9(htu )2 . (5.11) comparing observational data, since htu 1, see good portion total energy density universe originates space-time itself. since time scale universe large, would interesting estimate length scale space-time bit. obtain (cbtgtu )1/3 1014 (10 mev)1, (5.12) taken tu = 1010 year. although energy scale much lower planck energy within range high energy experiments, clear whether length scale observed high energy experiment astrophysical observation. 6. summary discussion paper, proposed uncertainty relation space-time estimated quantities quantum gravity. interesting point that, although proposed uncertainty relation dierent usually expected relations tx & l2 p x & lp , obtained results qualitatively consistent known results, found serious deviations them. purpose paper merely show surprise consistencies, give concrete way calculate quantities quantum gravity. course hope uncertainty relation proposed turns intermediate notion catches essential property quantum gravity. pecu- liar point space-time uncertainty relation consistent cosmological constant term. presently promising approach quantum gravity string theory. microscopic derivation entropy formula bps black hole d-brane dynam- ics impressive. 9) uncertainty relations string theory form tx & l2 9 x & lmin, 10) work evidently ultraviolet cuto. reduction degrees freedom infrared limit realized duality interchanges small scale large scale dynamics. 11), 10) thus possibility uncertainty relation similar derived string theory. hope well space-time uncertainty relation helpful constructing new theory describing quantum gravity. finally, lattice approaches quantum gravity, uncertainty relation kind x, & lmin seems assumed implicitly. 12) uncertainty relation may provide new direction approaches. acknowledgements would like thank h. hata carefully reading manuscript. work supported part grant-in-aid scientic research ministry education, science, sports culture (#09640346) priority area: supersymmetry unied theory elementary particles (#707). appendix appendix, evaluate quantity similar entropy statistical mechan- ics illustrate right-hand side (3.4) regarded quantity proportional entropy space-time. consider example. proof, reliable microscopic theory quantum gravity. let us consider space-time total number bits n, total volume v total energy e. quantity evaluate phase volume energies volumes constraint (2.4): (n, v, e) = n yi=1(cid:18)z 0 z 0 dvidei g2 (cid:0)viei g2(cid:1)(cid:19) n xi=1 vi v! n xi=1 ei e! , (a.1) (y) denotes step function: (y) = 1 0 otherwise vanishing. laplace transform (a.1) evaluated 0 n (n, , ) =z 0 z yi=1z 0 z =(cid:20)z dv g2 = 0 dv de g2 ev e(n, v, e) 0 dvidei g2 eviei(cid:0)viei g2(cid:1) eg2/v v(cid:21)n 10 =" =(cid:20) 2 k1(2pg2)#n pg2 (g2)3/4 exp(cid:16)2pg2(cid:17) h(cid:16)2pg2(cid:17)(cid:21)n , (a.2) k1(z) bessel function imaginary argument, h(z) function following asymptotic series large z: h(z) = xn=0 (3/2 + n) n!
