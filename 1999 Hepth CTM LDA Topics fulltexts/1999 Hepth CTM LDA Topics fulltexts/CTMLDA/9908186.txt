move second brane negative tension far away (in fact making size extra dimension innitely large), newtons law gravity still correctly reproduced brane due trapped zero mode. idea non-compact extra

(4.20) 5 comments cosmological constant problem one biggest puzzles particle physics vanishing cosmological constant (or value least 120 orders magnitudes smaller natural size order 4 p l would be).
