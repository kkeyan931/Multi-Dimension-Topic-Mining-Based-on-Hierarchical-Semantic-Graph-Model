i. introduction

the low energy eective action of n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory is described by

a prepotential and if this is obtained we can know (all) informations concerning to the eective

theory, namely, in this case the theory becomes solvable. actually, instantons have been known

to contribute to the prepotential,1 but not so much discussions were made. however, seiberg and

witten2 pointed out several years ago that it was possible to determine the prepotential including

instanton eects with the help of a riemann surface and periods of a meromorphic 1-form on it.

this approach using a riemann surface is in general referred to seiberg-witten theory.

the eective action of gauge theory occasionally including massive hypermultiplets in the funda-

mental representation of the gauge group has been discussed in many view points, and accordingly,

we have now much acquaintance with various properties of the prepotential and its related ma-

terials, such as picard-fuchs equations for periods,3,4,5,6,7 renormalization group like equation for

prepotential,8,9,10,11,12,13 relation to integrable systems,14,15 appearance of wdvv equations,16,17,18

at coordinates19,20 and so on.

on the contrary, for a theory coupled with adjoint hypermultiplets,21 not so much compared to

the above cases including fundamental hypermultiplets are revealed, but there are strong supports

that the relevant seiberg-witten solutions must be related with the integrable calogero dynamical

systems,22 and in fact, a few examples of prepotential associated with spectral curves expected from

calogero systems showed a good prediction of the instanton correction.23

on the other hand, recently, braden et al.24 analyzed a more general integrable system, called

ruijsenaars model, which can be thought as a relativistic version of calogero system.25 the

ruijsenaars model itself is considered as a candidate of integrable system related to ve-dimensional

gauge theory,26 and its specic limits are known to recover seiberg-witten solutions in four and

ve dimensions. at the perturbative level, we can easily establish these correspondences, but we

can not conclude that the ruijsenaars model is in fact the integrable system relevant to these gauge

theories unless instanton contribution is correctly taken into account. therefore, the only necessary

item to be discussed is now an exact treatment of this model including instanton eects. from

these reasons, we derive the instanton contribution to the prepotential of ruijsenaars model in this

paper.

2

the paper is organized as follows. in sec.ii, we briey review the correspondence among the

seiberg-witten solution to the su(2) gauge theory and calogero and ruijsenaars systems.

in

sec.iii, we consider the picard-fuchs equations for these integrable systems, but actually they are

found to be available from pakuliak-perelomov equations.27 in sec. iv, the period integrals and the

eective coupling constant of the ruijsenaars model are evaluated in the weak coupling regime. in

sec. v, a dierential equation for the prepotential is constructed from the pakuliak-perelomov type

picard-fuchs equation. one-instanton correction of the prepotential is presented. as a check, we

consider a reduction to the prepotential of calogero system and show that the instanton induced

prepotential is consistently determined. sec.vi is a brief summary.

ii. calogero and ruijsenaars systems

a. calogero system

to begin with, notice that the seiberg-witten solution to the su(2) yang-mills gauge theory

coupled with a massive adjoint matter hypermultiplet21,22,23 is related to the spectral curve

det(l()  t) = 0

(2.1)

of one-dimensional sl(2) elliptic calogero system with the 2 2 lax matrix with calogero coupling
constant g0

l() =

, p = p1 = p2, q = q1  q2,

(2.2)

where pi and qi are the canonical coordinate and momentum, respectively,  is the weierstrasss 

function (see appendix a) and  is the spectral parameter associated with an elliptic curve

y2(x) =

3yi=1
(x  ei),

3xi=1

ei = 0.

in (2.3), branching points ei are functions in the modulus  of (2.3) and have the expansion

e1 =

e2 = 
e3 = 

(1 + 24q2 + 24q4 +   ),

(1 + 24q + 24q2 + 96q3 +   ),
3

(1  24q + 24q2  96q3 +   ),

(2.3)

(2.4)

where q = ei . since  is identied with the bare eective coupling  = 4i/g2 + /2, where

g is the coupling constant and  is the vacuum angle, the factor q2 corresponds to the instanton

amplitude.

this spectral equation can be summarized into

g2
0() = t2  h,

h = p 2 + (q)

(2.5)

where () is the weierstrasss  function and h is the second hamiltonian of this system.

then the seiberg-witten dierential dscal is given in the form of twice of a product of the

eigenvalue t of the lax matrix and a holomorphic 1-form d on (2.3), namely,

dscal = 2td =

2qh + g2

0x

y

dx,

(2.6)

where we have identied x = (). in general, seiberg-witten dierential has the property such

that it reduces to a holomorphic dierential by a dierentiation over moduli, and in fact for the

case at hand, dscal/h  dx/y. below, we set g0 = 1 for convenience.
for this dierential, the seiberg-witten periods can be dened by

a =i

dscal,

ad =

 ef

a

dscal,

(2.7)

where  and  are the canonical basis of 1-cycles and ef is the prepotential.

itoyama and morozov22 made a very interesting observation with respect to this seiberg-witten

solution, which states that the data can be viewed as if they were given on the hyperelliptic curve

and the associated seiberg-witten dierential

b. ruijsenaars model

next, let us discuss the case of one-dimensional sl(2) ruijsenaars model,22,25 whose lax operator

matrix is given by

l() =vuut ()  (q)

()  ()

then the spectral equation

det(l()  t) = 0

(2.10)

(2.11)

determines the eigenvalue t, and by this we can construct its corresponding seiberg-witten solution,

but in contrast with the preceding calogero model, the seiberg-witten dierential in this case must

take the form

dsrui = ln td,

t =

h qh 2  () + ()

q()  ()

, h =q()  (q) cosh p ,

(2.12)

where h is the hamiltonian of the system, because of the requirement such that h dsrui must be

a holomorphic dierential. the seiberg-witten dierential of the form (2.12) is very characteristic,

and takes just the same form with those arising in ve-dimensional gauge theories. accordingly, the

ruijsenaars model will be understood in the context of higher dimensional gauge theory, although

a four-dimensional point of view, i.e., dsrui = 2td, was discussed by itoyama and morozov.22 in

fact, as is obvious from (2.12), we can see that the relation between holomorphic dierentials in

four and ve dimensions

notice that the dierence between dbscal and dscal is simply bh  h. below, we take + sign for the

eigenvalue t in (2.12).

(2.16)

iii. pakuliak-perelomov equations and picard-fuchs equations

to calculate the prepotential of ruijsenaars model, the periods (2.15) should be evaluated, but

the periods of a riemann surface are known to satisfy picard-fuchs equations. in the case at hand,

the picard-fuchs equation is available from that of the calogero model by focusing on (2.13). as a

matter of fact, though the seiberg-witten riemann surface (2.8) is hyperelliptic type represented by

branching points, since the seiberg-witten dierential (2.9) is a linear sum of abelian dierentials

on (2.8), we can use a general technique to get picard-fuchs equations for periods of hyperelliptic

riemann surfaces.3,4,5

however, for the case at hand, since the curve (2.8) is given by using branching points, the idea

of derivation of picard-fuchs equations will naturally overlap to that of pakuliak and perelomov,27

provided the branching points also including x = h are regarded as if they were independent
variables. namely, picard-fuchs equation in the calogero system, and thus that of the ruijsenaars

model, are obtained from pakuliak-perelomov equations.

a. pakuliak-perelomov equations

in general, the hyperelliptic curve of genus r can be realized as a double cover of a polynomial

in x

y2 =

2r+2yi=1

(x  ei) =

2r+2xi=0

(1)ii(ej)x2r+2i,

(3.1)

where ek are the branching points on the x-plane and we have expressed the coecients of powers

in x by i(ej). do not confuse them with the weierstrasss  function.

we can dene the periods of abelian dierentials on (3.1) by

kj =i

xj
y

dx,

j = 0, 1,    , 2r

(3.2)

where  is an arbitrary non-contractible 1-cycle on (3.1). pakuliak-perelomov equations are the

equations of a system of rst-order dierential equations satised by kj and the reduction method

to get such equations can be done in the following way.

first, notice that the rst-order derivatives are given by

the right hand side of (3.12) is a linear sum of various kn, but it would be easy to obtain the

equations satised by a single ki by repeating dierentiations, and accordingly, such equations

compose a picard-fuchs system.

b. picard-fuchs equations for calogero model

in the calogero model, if we focus only on h-derivatives, the picard-fuchs equation of the

third-order

where

follows from (3.12).

4h(cal2

hdscal) + 3hhdscal = 0,

cal(h) =

(h + ei),

3yi=1

(3.13)

(3.14)

since the seiberg-witten solution involves another parameter, the bare coupling constant, one

more equation including  -derivatives like that discussed by itoyama and morozov22 may be ex-

pected. however, the derivation of prepotential from such equation requires technical problems, so

we do not discuss it in this paper.

c. picard-fuchs equation for ruijsenaars model

it is now easy to nd picard-fuchs equation for ruijsenaars model, if we notice the relation

(2.13). since dbscal satises the picard-fuchs equation (3.13) replaced h by bh, we can obtain from

(2.13) and (3.13)

(cid:20)3

h + h(cid:18)ln

where



h(cid:19) 2

h + 3h 2bhh(cid:21) dsrui = 0,
3yi=1(cid:16)bh + ei(cid:17) .

 =

(3.15)

(3.16)

iv. periods

to derive the instanton correction for the prepotential of ruijsenaars model, some items should

be prepared appropriately. the rst one is the calculation of periods, but in contrast with usual

cases, the evaluation of periods is very sensitive because the seiberg-witten dierential of ruijse-

naars model involves a normalization factor dierential depending on q, i.e., the second term of the

right hand side of

8

dsrui = ln(cid:20)h +qbh + x(cid:21) dx

y  lnh() + xi dx

y

.

(4.1)

since this term is independent of h, the picard-fuchs equation can not detect the contribution of

instantons arising from this term, but it is necessary to calculate this in order to include instanton

eects correctly. otherwise, the prepotential will not reduce to any physical prepotential by scaling

limits.24

with this in remind, we can see that the period a in the weak coupling region (i  ,

q = ei  0) behaves as

ira = ln(cid:20)h sin  +qh 2 sin2   1(cid:21) 

4h(h 2 sin2   sin2   1) sin3 

(h 2 sin2   1)3/2

q2 +   

and thus its inverse relation follows immediately

h =

cos ra
sin 

+

2(2  cos 2  cos 2ra) sin  cos ra

sin2 ra

q2 +    .

(4.2)

(4.3)

on the other hand, as for the dual period ad, it is enough to calculate it only at the lowest

order in q for a later convenience (see also ref. 24).

.

(4.4)

accordingly, extracting the nite part of (4.4) and with the help of (4.3), we get the perturbative

eective coupling constant

e(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)q0

(4.5)

this coincides with the perturbative calculus.26

v. instanton correction for prepotential of ruijsenaars model

a. dierential equation for prepotential

in the case of genus one seiberg-witten riemann surface, we can give a dierential equation for

prepotential by using a familiar method using inversion relations of periods.8,12

9

for our case, derivatives of periods are inverted by12

(5.3)

in (5.3), c is an integration constant to be xed below. versions of (5.3) can be found in several

su(2) gauge theories.12,28 note that (5.3) agrees with the equation obtained from residue calculus

[cf. (6.21) in ref. 17].

b. instanton correction to prepotential

next, substituting (4.3) into (5.3) and expanding it by q, we can arrive at



f

f2 cot ra

sin ra(cid:19)4

where

+88 cos 2ra cos 2 + 20 cos 4ra cos 2  14 cos 2ra cos 4.

(5.5)

the second term of (5.4) is the one-instanton contribution.

to x the constant c, let us consider the limit q  0. then noticing f

 = e/a, we get

from (4.5).

c = i

(5.6)

c. reduction to calogero model

as a check of our calculus, let us take a scaling limit  = (1  i)2mr, r  0. then it is

straightforward to show that

a(a2 + 4im2)

q2 +    .

(5.7)

if the parameter m is identied with the mass of the adjoint hypermultiplet, this coincides with the

third-order derivative of prepotential of the calogero model in the n = 2 limit (see appendix b).

other scaling limits can be treated in a similar way.

vi. summary

in this paper, we have shown that:

 the picard-fuchs equation in the ruijsenaars system is generated from pakuliak-perelomov

equations.

 from the dierential equation for prepotential, one-instanton prepotential of the ruijsenaars

model is obtained.

 our prepotential is checked in the limit to the n = 2 limit of calogero system, i.e., the n = 2

gauge theory with a massive adjoint hypermultiplet.

appendix a: weierstrass functions

suppose that f (z) is a complex single valued function with the complex argument z. then if

f (z + ) = f (z) holds for a complex number , f is called a periodic function with period . if f

f is called elliptic function. the weierstrass functions are the elliptic functions with this property.

in this appendix, we summarize some formulae and prepotential in calogero model, but the

derivation of prepotential is parallel to that of ruijsenaars model, so only the necessary items are

listed, and g0 is identied as g2

0 = im2/, where m is the mass of the adjoint hypermultiplet. in

this calculation, we present in the weak coupling region, and the 1-cycles are taken as the same

ones with the ruijsenaars model. in addition, note that due to our normalization there are several
