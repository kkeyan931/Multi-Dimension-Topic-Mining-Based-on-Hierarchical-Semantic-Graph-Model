abstract

string theory on curved backgrounds has received much attention on account of both its
own interest, and in its relation with gauge theories. despite the progress made in various
directions, several quite elementary questions remain unanswered, in particular in the very
simple case of three-dimensional anti-de sitter space. i will very briey review these prob-
lems, discuss in some detail the important issue of constructing a consistent spectrum for a
string propagating on ads3 plus torsion background, and comment on potential solutions.

1 string theory on ads3: the simplest setting beyond at space

string theory is certainly the most appropriate setting for studying quantum-gravity phe-
nomena. this includes big-bang cosmology, black-hole physics, and more general gravita-
tional/gauge solitons or other exotic objects.
in the absence of a truly non-perturbative
approach to string theory, the usual method consists in analysing the propagation of the
string on non-trivial backgrounds generated by some sources, which correspond either to
perturbative or to non-perturbative string states. consistency of string propagation imposes
severe restrictions on the allowed backgrounds, which must be conformal so as to satisfy the
whole set of requirements exactly in . approximations can also be found by solving the
relevant equations of motion up to some order in .

three-dimensional anti-de sitter (or de sitter) space was recognized long ago as a case of
interest with respect to the above motivations [1][6]. it is a maximally symmetric solution of
einsteins equations with negative cosmological constant, and time is embedded non-trivially
in the curved geometry. alternatively, it corresponds to the freedmangibbons electrovac
solution of gauged supergravity, which can be shown to leave space-time supersymmetry
unbroken [7]. other peculiar features of ads3 are the absence of asymptotically at regions,
the presence of boundaries, as well as a rich causal structure, which makes it possible to
obtain three-dimensional black holes after modding out some discrete symmetry [8].

as far as string theory is concerned, ads3 is an exact background, provided an ns
ns two-form is switched on. in fact, three-dimensional anti-de sitter space is the universal
covering of the su(1, 1) group manifold, and the corresponding two-dimensional conformally
invariant sigma model is a wesszuminowitten model, which naturally accounts for the
torsion background.

several remarks can be made here in order to argue that ads3 provides the simplest
setting for string theory beyond at space. general non-compact group manifolds dene a
natural framework for studying strings on space-times with non-trivial geometry. restrict-
ing ourselves to the case of simple groups, however, only su(1, 1) possesses a single time
direction; ads3 is therefore the only exact background where string propagation leads to a
wzw model. of course, cosets with one time direction can be constructed out of simple
non-compact group manifolds. this is the case, for instance, for adsn, which appears as
o(2, n  1)/o(1, n  1). however, these geometries cannot be obtained by the usual gko
construction in the framework of gauged wzw models.

last but not least, the motivation for understanding string theory on ads3, and more
generally on adsn, is related to the recent developments on ads/cft correspondence [9].
there, supergravity in the bulk of anti-de sitter space is argued to be in some sense equiva-
lent to a large-n super-yangmills theory on the boundary. since the supergravity theory
under consideration is the low-energy limit of a more fundamental superstring theory, the
question arises of the exact structure of the latter on the anti-de sitter background, and
its connexion to the super-yangmills theory on the boundary. here also ads3 plays a
particular role. the asymptotic isometry group is innite-dimensional [10], and the theory
on the boundary is a two-dimensional conformal eld theory. the latter is dierent from the
two-dimensional sigma model whose target space is the bulk ads3 on which the string

1

propagates. considerable eorts have been made for understanding the relationship between
these two conformal theories, in order to both set more precisely the ads/cft correspon-
dence, and try to get some feedback on the structure of the string theory on ads3 [11]1.

despite those eorts and the apparent simplicity of the model at hand, i will show
that several important and elementary issues, such as the determination of the spectrum,
consistent with the basic requirements of string theory and conformal eld theory, are still
beyond our understanding. i will also try to motivate various suggestions for further analysis.

although we are ultimately interested in understanding how superstrings behave on ads3
background, i will concentrate in the sequel on the bosonic case, where the issues i would
like to address are already visible. moreover, this case might have some relevance in the
framework of recent attempts at establishing some relationship between various bosonic
theories  including perhaps the celebrated 26-dimensional theory.

2 the su (1, 1) wesszuminowitten model

the analysis of string theory on ads3 plus torsion background can be performed in two
steps. first, we must study the sigma model whose target space has the above geometry;
this is a wzw model on the su(1, 1) group manifold. then, the latter has to be coupled to
two-dimensional gravity. at the level of the hilbert space, this amounts to the decoupling
of a certain subspace, which becomes unphysical.

as a general remark, it should be stressed here that the geometrical interpretation of
a conformal eld theory as a string propagating in some backgrounds, is sometimes loose.
it becomes unambiguous only in some semi-classical limits, or in the presence of a dense
spectrum of kaluzaklein modes. hence, one should be aware that very often one is not de-
scribing the situation for which the model was designed. conversely, unexpected geometrical
interpretations may arise.

very little is known about wzw models on non-compact groups, at a suciently rig-
orous and general level. most of our knowledge is based on a formal extension of the com-
pact case to some specic situations, and in the framework of current-algebra techniques.
boundary conditions, in particular, are treated somehow carelessly, although we know how
important they are for selecting various representations when studying quantum mechanics
on ads3 [12], or in the determination of the asymptotic symmetry algebra acting on that
space [10]. this should be kept in mind in any attempt to go beyond our present knowledge
of the subject.

we usually assume that the so(2, 2) = su(1, 1)l  su(1, 1)r symmetry of the above
model is realized in terms of an ane lie algebra, the level of which is not quantized because
3(su(1, 1)) = 0 or, put dierently, because of the absence of any dirac-like singularity in
the torsion background.

(2.1)

finally, the hilbert space is formally constructed as in the compact case: it is a direct
sum of products of representations of the left and right current algebras. highest-weight
representations2 of the su(1, 1) current algebra are labelled by the spin j of the primary
elds (states of level zero), which form a representation of the global algebra (generated by
the zero modes j ,3

), and have conformal weight j(j + 1)/k + 2.

irreducible representations of the global algebra are essentially of two kinds [15]: discrete
d(j) or continuous principal cp(b, a) and continuous supplementary cs(j, a). the discrete
ones have highest (d) or lowest (d+) weight, whereas the continuous ones do not. the
spin j of the discrete representations is real3, and their states are labelled by |jmi, m =
j, j  1, j  2, . . . for the principal continuous ones, j =  1

ones,  1

representations are unitary and innite-dimensional; d(j) become nite-dimensional when
j is a positive integer or half-integer, and are non-unitary for any positive j. notice nally
that the quadratic casimir (j(j + 1)) is negative for both continuous series; for the discrete
ones it is negative or positive when 1 < j < 0 or j < 1, respectively.

highest-weight representations of the current algebra are obtained by acting with j ,3
1
on the above level-zero states, which are annihilated by all positive-frequency modes. these
representations contain an innite tower of negative-norm states, due to the indenite metric
gab. therefore, in the above setting, it is impossible to write down a unitary conformal theory
based on the su(1, 1) wzw model. this is not surprising, and the same conclusion holds
anyway for three free bosons with metric ( + +), obtained here when k  .

2(cid:12)(cid:12) < 1

i now come to the following crucial question: how should the above representations be
combined to form a consistent, though non-unitary, model? in order to answer this question,

2representations without highest or lowest weight do exist [13]. it is, however, not clear how those could
be interpreted within a stable string theory. more representations of the su (1, 1) current algebra can be
found in [14].

3in order to avoid closed time-like curves, we are considering the universal covering of su (1, 1). therefore,

j is not quantized.

3

we can follow the requirement of modular invariance. the genus-one partition function reads,
in general:

z(,  ) =xl,r

nl,r l( ) r( ) ,

(2.2)

where the summation is performed over all leftright representations present in the spectrum,
and ( ) are the corresponding characters:

( ) = tr ql0 c

24 ,

(2.3)

q = exp 2i . the multiplicities nl,r must be chosen in such a way that the partition
function is invariant under    + 1 and   1/ . notice that, again, eq. (2.2) is formal
in the non-compact case, and one should prove it, e.g. by using path-integral techniques
starting directly from the wzw action, as in ref. [6].

already at this level, a major problem appears, which is actually generic to all non-
compact groups. the unitary representations of the global algebra being innite-dimensional,
there is an innite degeneracy level by level in the representations of the current algebra,
and consequently the characters (2.3) are ill-dened4. this is the price to pay for using the
full non-compact and non-abelian symmetry to classify the states of the theory. in fact, this
is not specic to the two-dimensional sigma model we are analysing. similar problems would
occur in the relativistic quantum mechanics of a particle on a two-dimensional plane, if we
tried to describe its propagator by using wave-function representations of the full lorentz
group so(2, 1). the reason why free bosons can be analysed without trouble just relies on
the abelian nature of the symmetry used to classify their spectrum.

in our formal treatment, the only way out is to lift the degeneracy by switching on a

source coupled to j 3
0 :

(, v) = tr ql0 c

24 e2ivj 3

0 .

(2.4)

notice, however, that this denition does not allow a regularization of the characters of the
representations based on the continuous series5. this shows that discrete and continuous
representations denitely play dierent roles, and that the continuous ones do not t into
the present current-algebra approach.

in computing the characters, the main diculty is to properly identify the singular vec-
tors. these are zero-norm states orthogonal to any other state; their descendents possess
the same property and they are thus responsible for the reducibility of the verma modules.
exhaustive and rigorous results can be found in refs. [16].

there are some particular sets of representations of the current algebra: the admissible

4we could consider nite-dimensional non-unitary representations of the global algebra, since the verma
module built on any representation is anyway non-unitary. however, for later use in string theory, this choice
would not be sensible.

(2.5)

(2.6)

the primary states do not necessarily belong to some unitary representation of the global
algebra, since j can be positive. singular vectors appear at various levels, which makes the
evaluation of (2.4) quite intricate. nevertheless, the characters of these series were obtained
in [17]. they turn out to form nite representations of the modular group, which now acts
as:

t : (, v)  ( + 1, v) , s : (, v) (cid:18)

1


,

v

(cid:19) .

rational models with an ade type of classication can be constructed by using the
above results [18]. besides being non-unitary, these models have peculiar properties. their
central charge is given by c = 3 6u/t, which is negative when t < 2u. moreover, the above
models are only dened in the presence of a magnetic eld, which is not invariant under
modular transformations. the interpretation of these features is not clear.

for string-theory purposes, the level of the current algebra should satisfy k < 2: this
ensures positive central charge as well as a single time-like direction in the target space,
which are both necessary conditions for the physical spectrum to be free of negative-norm
states. furthermore, as far as the discrete series are concerned, j should be non-positive
in order to avoid unitarity problems already at level zero. this excludes the admissible
representations, and therefore the possibility of using their modular-invariant combinations.
in the regime k < 2, very little is known about the characters of the su(1, 1) current
algebra. those characters can be computed in the case of highest-weight representations
based on discrete series (eq. (2.4)), for generic values of k and j, where no singular vectors
are present, with the result [19, 20]:

6in the context of the su (2) wzw, using the gko coset construction, these series lead to the minimal
bpz models with c < 1. for the integer level (u = 1 in eq. (2.5)), unitarity is guaranteed, and one gets the
ade invariants for su (2) as well as the corresponding unitary series at c < 1.

expression (2.7) does not hold for some discrete sets of (k, j)s, such as when 2jk+n = 1,
n a positive integer, or when j = m/2, m  z, independently of k. in such cases, the presence
of null states will obviously spoil (2.7). in those situations it is probably more of a technical
problem than a conceptual one to determine the exact characters. a much more dicult
issue is certainly how to combine the various characters for obtaining modular-invariant
partition functions. as an example, we can consider the modular transformations of the
characters (2.7). we obtain:

(2.9)

these transformations involve all values of j, with zero measure for the discrete sets of repre-
sentations possessing singular vectors. constructions involving only these generic characters
turn out to be too naive, and do not enable us to obtain modular-invariant combinations. in
particular, the diagonal combination integrated over all values of j (again, all primary states
do not belong to unitary representations of the global algebra) is not modular-invariant
because of the k-dependent prefactor appearing in (2.9). nevertheless, considering this com-
bination, we nd:

(as usually, in the presence of a time-like coordinate, analytic continuation is needed 
here when k < 2 in eqs. (2.9) and (2.10)). under an s-transformation, an extra factor
appears:
it is interesting to observe that the result (2.10) was obtained
in [6] as the partition function of euclidean three-dimensional anti-de sitter space, h 3
+ 
sl(2, c)/su(2), by using a rigorous path-integral approach7. it is not clear why such a
non-modular-invariant partition function would be satisfactory in the case of h 3
+. i would
rather interpret the breakdown of modular invariance as a sign that, among others, we should
consider more carefully the appearance of representations with singular vectors. i will come
back to this point when studying the string on ads3.

so far, i have been considering the construction of conformal models based on su(1, 1)
wzw at level k. the encountered problems can be summarized as follows. one is the
innite degeneracy at each level in the representations of the current algebra, and in par-
ticular the treatment of the representations based on the continuous series for which no
character formula has been proposed in the mathematical literature. this problem might
be xed in a path-integral approach, where a zero mode responsible for the corresponding
(innite-volume-like) divergence could be identied and removed. alternatively, we might
also need a deformation of the ane sugawara construction in order to lift the degeneracy
without coupling to an external eld. modication of the current algebra itself has also

7see also [21] for a rigorous treatment of h 3

+. in ref. [6], the two-dimensional euclidean black hole was

also analysed. for the latter, the result turns out to be modular-invariant.

6

been advocated [22]. the question then arises whether these deformations still describe the
initial wzw theory. for example, in the compact-group wzw models, the natural stress
tensor, obtained by dierentiating the action with respect to the metric, is precisely the one
given by the ane sugawara construction [23]. any deformation with respect to the latter,
possibly continuous and conformal, will abandon the original wzw theory.

another problem is related to the construction of various modular-invariant partition
functions: what are the sets of representations  including representations based on both
discrete and continuous series  which form a well-behaved opa? only the sets of admissible
representations, based on some discrete series, have been identied.

this question is dicult and we can somehow understand why by comparing our case
to the situation of a wzw model on the group manifold of su(2). the su(2) theory can
be unitary because the ane algebra has unitary highest-weight representations for integer
and half-integer spin such that 0  j  k/2 (k is integer here). modular invariance is
therefore expected for combinations of representations falling within this range, and indeed
this happens. that is not a miracle: the structure of characters, and thereby their modu-
lar transformations, is directly dictated by the presence of singular vectors, which in turn
determine the unitarity properties of the representations since they appear as limiting cases
of positive-norm states becoming negative-norm. for example, the (sucient) condition
2j  k + n = 1 for having a null state at level n has solutions within the range j  k/2,
which embeds the unitarity domain. another instructive example is the case of the free
boson. there, all representations of the u(1) algebra are unitary  none if the boson is of
time-like signature  and are labelled by a continuous momentum. no null states appear
and all representations must be used in a consistent model. they lead to the celebrated

(cid:16) im  (cid:17)1

partition function. both for the su(2) wzw model and for the free boson,
unitarity is a guideline for reaching modular-invariance. for su(1, 1) there are no unitary
highest-weight representations of the current algebra, whereas some have null states and
some others do not. unitarity and presence or absence of singular vectors cannot therefore
be successfully advocated for constructing modular-invariant combinations.

3 string theory on su (1, 1)

i will now analyse the string propagating over the su(1, 1) group manifold. the coupling of
the above conformal model to the two-dimensional gravity creates spurious states that we
should eliminate from the spectrum. the most straightforward approach would have been the
light-cone-gauge analysis. unfortunately, this method is hard to implement (despite several
attempts [24]) and we have therefore to advocate  without rigorous proof  that going to
the conformal gauge and imposing the virasoro constraints will eliminate all spurious states,
provided the conformal anomaly is cancelled.

in this analysis, the natural questions are the following: what are the representations of
the su(1, 1)l  su(1, 1)r current algebra that should be kept in order to have a consistent
theory (in particular a well-behaved operator algebra)? what are the roles of discrete versus
continuous representations? are all physical states of positive norm? what kind of particles

7

do these states describe, and what are the corresponding vertex operators?

anomaly cancellation for the bosonic string implies c = 26, where c accounts for all
matter-eld contributions. string theory on su(1, 1) can be critical on its own, since the
level of the ane algebra can be freely tuned to reach the critical central charge: k = 52/23.
it might be relevant, however, to keep k free, and couple the su(1, 1) sigma model to some
unitary conformal eld theory such as d free bosons, a wzw model on su(2), . . . this can
help in understanding the theory at large |k|, corresponding to the near-at-space limit.

as was emphasized in the previous section, very little is known about the wzw model on
su(1, 1). the only guideline is therefore the search for representations of the current algebra
leading to a positive-denite physical hilbert space. in fact, it is straightforward to argue
that within the class of highest-weight representations of the su(1, 1) current algebra we have
considered, and in the general framework we have presented so far for analysing the string
propagation on a non-compact manifold, there is no satisfactory selection of representations
that can be performed, which guarantees the absence of negative-norm states in the physical
hilbert space.

the argument goes as follows.

i will concentrate on the left-movers, keeping in mind
that they should be eventually paired with right-movers. a highest-weight representation
of the current algebra is built on a representation of the global algebra, which denes the
level-zero states and is annihilated by positive-frequency current modes. acting on those
states with j ,3
1 will generate the verma module. at each level, the set of states can be
decomposed with respect to the global algebra. since the virasoro generators commute with
the modes j ,3
(see eq. (2.1)), virasoro constraints (lm|physicali = 0 m > 0) will keep
or throw away complete representations of the global algebra. this considerably simplies
the rules for implementing unitarity: (i) the level-zero states should all have positive norm,
i.e. be a unitary representation of the global algebra of the type d(j), cp(b, a) or cs(j, a)
(see previous section for the allowed values of the parameters j, a, b); (ii) at each level,
any physical representation should also have parameters consistent with unitarity; this last
statement ensures that all states of the representation at hand are positive-norm, provided
the norm of one of them is indeed positive.

0

a simple computation shows that, irrespectively of the type of unitary level-zero represen-
tation, d(j), cp(b, a) or cs(j, a), at level one there will be generically three representations
of the global su(1, 1) algebra: two virasoro primaries (i.e. physical up to mass-shell condi-
tion) with spin j + 1 and j  1, and an unphysical one with spin j. this generalizes at level
n, where we meet at least two virasoro-primary representations, with spin j  n.

in the case of continuous series cp(b, a) or cs(j, a), already at level one, the values of
the spin are out of the unitarity range: for cp(b, a) the quadratic casimir becomes complex,
whereas it becomes positive for cs(j, a). on the other hand, at level n, mass-shell condition
reads:

j(j + 1)

k + 2

+ n  1

(3.1)

(an internal positive conformal weight is supposed to compensate the dierence with respect

8

to 1); this shows that the maximal allowed level for a primary spin-j representation is

nm(j) = integer part(cid:18)1 

j(j + 1)

k + 2 (cid:19) .

(3.2)

therefore, as far as the continuous series are concerned, in the regime of interest (k < 2),
nm(j) = 0. unitarity is guaranteed, but these representations only describe part of the
tachyonic sector of the theory [20].

the case of discrete series goes along the same lines. for k < 2, all states have positive
norm in the range 1 < j < 0, but are all tachyonic (level zero only is allowed). when
j  1, nm(j)  1, which corresponds to more general massive, massless or tachyonic
excitations. however, since nm(j) grows quadratically with j, for suciently large |j|,
nm(j) + j becomes positive, and physical non-unitary representations appear [2]. negative-
norm states remain in the spectrum8.

the situation described above is not very encouraging. representations of the current
algebra based both on continuous and discrete series seem to be required for generating
the complete bosonic spectrum. virasoro constraints and mass-shell condition guarantee
unitarity for the continuous series  which describe only tachyons , but do not succeed in

on-shell states in the current-algebra representation is no longer positive; for these states

the case of discrete representations. when the spin is of order j < k + 2, the norm of the
m 2 > |k + 3|.
within this framework, if we insist on having a theory free of negative-norm states,
the only possibility left would be to cut the spin j (jmin  j < 0) in such a way that
nm(jmin)+jmin be non-positive [3]. we thus avoid some physical non-unitary representations
that would have been present otherwise, and there is hope that all negative-norm states
decouple in this way.

it is important to be aware that this latter possibility violates the generic structure of
the string spectrum itself. we lose the innite tower of string modes (the mass is cut o
at the scale of the radius of ads3), and consequently the hope of constructing a consistent
spectrum shrinks. modular invariance is expected to be spoiled. moreover, we cannot even
keep the unit representation in the spectrum, namely the current-algebra representation with
j = 0, since nm(j = 0) = 1, and level one contains a representation of the global algebra
with spin 1, which is not unitary. despite these features the above possibility has been
worked out because of some appealing properties. let me briey summarize the situation.
starting from a level-zero unitary discrete representation d(j) (j < 0), we nd a repre-
sentation d(j + 1) at level one, which is virasoro-primary. the norm of its highest weight
is given by 2j  k. the mass-shell condition implies that this representation is present as
long as j  1 (remember k < 2). in that range, unitarity thus demands

k
2  j < 0 .

(3.3)

8as expected, the situation for k > 2 is worse and unitarity is denitely lost in that case. for the
continuous series, nm(j)  1. thus, for any spin, non-unitary physical representations appear at several
levels. the same conclusion holds for the discrete series with 1  j < 0, whereas only tachyons are physical
for j < 1.

condition (3.3) is the key of our analysis [3, 4]. it is similar to the condition appearing
in su(2)k and has in fact the same origin, although its purpose here is not to garantee the
unitarity of the su(1, 1) wzw model, but the unitarity of the latter modded out by the
virasoro constraints. the above condition on the spin has drastic consequences over the
string spectrum. by using eq. (3.2), there appears an absolute upper bound on the string
level,

k

4(cid:19) ,

nmax = integer part(cid:18)1 

(3.4)

and similarly for the mass squared. for instance, if the string is a pure wzw model on
su(1, 1), k = 52/23, and the physical spectrum is made out of tachyons and massless
states only. on the other hand, we can add an internal unitary conformal eld theory with
positive central charge cint. the bigger cint is, the larger |k| is, and more and more massive
are the states that the physical spectrum acquires9.

as was pointed out previously, the consistency of a string with a nite number of mass
levels is questionable. one can in particular wonder what the issue of modular invariance
could be. following our discussion of section 2, it appears that modular transformations
of characters for generic values of (k, j) (see eq. (2.9)) violate the bound (3.3). of course,
special values of the spin where singular vectors appear in the verma module can lead
to characters with dierent modular properties, and modular-invariant combinations could
eventually be reached. unfortunately, interesting situations arise when 2j  k + n = 1 [16],
which is out of the would-be unitarity range. anyhow, since we do not know the su(1, 1)
characters in the regime k < 2, we cannot go any further in the present analysis.

finally, the question to be answered is still whether the above condition (3.3) can indeed

help to restore unitarity.

as already mentioned earlier, at level n, there appears one representation of the global
algebra with spin j + n, which is virasoro-primary. constraint (3.3) combined with mass-
shell condition (3.1) is sucient to guarantee that j + n never becomes positive. unitarity
also requires the highest-weight vector of that representation to be positive-norm. this
makes condition (3.3) necessary and sucient (the norm vanishes at k = 2j).

there also appears at level n a virasoro-primary representation with spin j  n; since
j  n is always negative, all we must check is the norm of its highest-weight vector. for
j < 1/2 and k < 2, its norm is strictly positive, at any n (it vanishes at j = 1/2 and is
negative for 1/2 < j < 0, but in this range only level zero is allowed by (3.1)). condition
(3.3) plays no role here.

although technically involved, it is quite straightforward to prove explicitly the absence
of negative-norm states at both level one and level two [3]. the rst level is the only one
allowed by condition (3.3) for a pure wzw su(1, 1) model (see eq. (3.4) with k = 52/23),
and does not contain, in that case, other virasoro primaries. unitarity is therefore proved10.

9notice that in the at-space limit, the upper bound on the mass disappears. this limit cannot therefore
rule out the above analysis. it can, however, serve as a guideline to check the consistency of the results
obtained in ads3.

10by mass-shell condition (3.4), level two would be allowed for j = 1/2 p47/23/2 < k/2 = 26/23.

10

in order to see what happens at level two, i.e. which representations survive the virasoro
constraints, we must consider some extra unitary conformal eld theory. it is simple, and
quite instructive as far as counting of states is concerned, to add d free bosons. the total
central charge is now d + 3k/(k + 2), whereas the space-time dimension becomes d = d + 3.
the critical dimension is dcr = 29  3k
k+2.

at level one the total number of representations of the global su(1, 1) algebra is d
(1 with spin j + 1, d  2 with spin j, and 1 with spin j  1). among them, d  1 are
virasoro-primary: 1 with spin j + 1, d  3 with spin j, and 1 with spin j  1. on shell,
d  2 have positive norm, and 1 has zero norm (with spin j).

at level two, the total number of representations is d(d + 3)/2; 1 has spin j + 2, d  1
have spin j + 1, d(d  1)/2 have spin j, d  1 have spin j  1, and 1 has spin j  2.
there are (d + 2)(d  1)/2 virasoro primaries: 1 with spin j + 2, d  2 with spin j + 1,
(d  1)(d  2)/2 with spin j, d  2 with spin j  1, and 1 with spin j  2. the on-shell
positivity properties of these representations are the following:
(i) for d < dcr: d(d  1)/2 positive-norm; d  1 zero-norm, among which 1 with spin
j + 1, d  3 with spin j, and 1 with spin j  1.
(ii) for d = dcr: (d + 1)(d  2)/2 positive-norm; d zero-norm, among which 1 with spin
j + 1, d  2 with spin j, and 1 with spin j  1.
(iii) for d > dcr: (d + 1)(d  2)/2 positive-norm; d  1 zero-norm, among which 1 with
spin j + 1, d  3 with spin j, and 1 with spin j  1; 1 negative-norm with spin j.
we thus conclude that all negative-norm states decouple from the physical spectrum, pro-
vided d  dcr. unitarity is lost otherwise.

these level-two unitarity properties assume condition (3.3). if j becomes smaller than
k/2, not only does the extremal representation with spin j + 2 become non-unitary, but also
d4 representations with spin j+1, and 1 with spin j, no matter if we are below, at, or above
the critical dimension. this emphasizes the role played by our unitarity condition, and gives
some credit to the method we have presented so far, despite the consistency problems that
such a bound on the spin creates at the level of the spectrum. it is even more puzzling that
a real no-ghost theorem might exist, based on the above observations and more specically
on the constraint (3.3) over the spin of the allowed discrete representations. various works
seem to conrm this viewpoint [25].

as a nal remark, i would like to use the above on-shell counting of states to infer what
the partition function would look like, at least for the contributions originated from the
representations of the current algebra based on the discrete series. string partition functions
count precisely on-shell states  up to level-matching condition. we thus obtain11:

z(,  , v, v)  v1q1(cid:18)1 + (cid:0)e2iv + d  4 + e2iv(cid:1) q

+ (cid:18)e4iv + e4iv +(cid:0)e2iv + e2iv(cid:1) (d  3)

condition (3.3) is violated, and unitarity is lost.

11expression (3.5), except for the innite degeneracy level by level, is similar to the corresponding one for
the free bosonic string. this is due to the structure of su (1, 1) algebra, and does not hold at higher levels.

in fact, any power of q and q ( 3) is expected as a consequence of modular covariance:

whereas f (,  , v, v) should be invariant under    + 1. these constraints can ac-
tually be satised with expressions that do not fall in the class of (3.7), such as f =
(2 im  )1/2 exp (2( im v)2/ im  ), inspired from eq. (2.10). such functions are not allowed
here since they do not exhibit the correct weight shift to full the mass-shell condition.
furthermore, at large |k| (d  26) and small v, matching with the ordinary 26-dimensional
string requires the following behaviour12: f  |v|2( im  )3/2, where  is a constant ex-
pected to diverge like |k|3/2. in order to obtain correctly the various behaviours, one should
therefore rely on the generic form (see eq. (2.2)) f (,  , v, v) = pj, nj, fj(, v) f( , v),
where fj(, v) is the factor in the character of the spin-j representation, which accounts for
the null states in the verma module. the presence of terms of o (q3) and o (q3) precisely
traces back the appearance of representations of the su(1, 1) current algebra in the spectrum,
which contain null states at levels higher than two. as was already pointed out previously,
such representations are expected to appear for j  k/2; this bound is in contradiction with
the unitarity constraint (3.3).

obviously, using naive generic-(k, j) characters (2.7) cannot lead to an expression for
f (,  , v, v) consistent with (3.7). furthermore, it is hard to believe that f exists, such that
expression (3.6) is polynomial in q, q of degree nmax, as is suggested by the previous study
of unitarity. once more, compatibility between unitarity and modular invariance appears as
an important issue in understanding the string propagating over ads3.

4 summary and comments

string theory on three-dimensional anti-de sitter space-time has been commented for a long
time. no satisfactory understanding of its basic features, such as the complete spectrum of

12this is precisely the next-to-leading behaviour of expression (2.10). the leading term diverges like

k/|v|2, and should be avoided in the presence of world-sheet supersymmetry. the various uncertainties

related to the meaning of (2.10), however, do not enable us to draw any conclusion.

12

perturbative states, has yet been reached. by formally using the standard current-algebra
approach of conformal eld theory in the framework of a non-compact group manifold, it
seems that unitarity would demand an upper bound to the mass spectrum. this conclusion
is in disagreement with elementary principles of string theory, leads to serious problems in
computing one-loop amplitudes, and has no physical foundation: nothing similar appears in
the quantum motion of a free particle on ads3, which is expected to be the   0 limit of
the string, and where all possible representations of su(1, 1) appear in the wave-function,
with appropriate interpretation [12].

nevertheless,

it is quite amazing that the cut-o over the spins could really x the
unitarity problem [3, 4, 25], and this may be a good reason to try to keep the above results,
and rephrase them within a somewhat less formal approach. this means that we should
get a better understanding of the su(1, 1) wzw model at the classical level13, explore
the classical motion of a string, and maybe try to follow a path-integral approach `a la
gawedzki [6]. this implies in particular a proper treatment of the boundary conditions
that are hard to implement within the current-algebra method. they might play a role in
reconciling unitarity with the appearance of states of the discrete series with spin j < k/2, i.e.
with mass above the anti-de sitter radius scale. these states are cut o in our analysis but
should be present for physical reasons, and might originate from some other unitary sector of
the theory, which would have been missed here14. the role of continuous series could also be
claried. although they are compatible with unitarity, the corresponding excitations seem
to be all tachyonic.

as was pointed out previously, one could try alternatively to avoid the mass/spin cut-o
and the purely tachyonic continuous representations in various ways, playing essentially with
the current algebra, and/or modifying the ane sugawara construction. it even seems that
contact with some ads/cft-inspired results can be made in that way [33]. however, it
is not clear whether such modications leave unaltered the interpretation of the theory as
a string propagating over ads3 (in [22], logarithmic cuts and a new zero mode are intro-
duced in the currents, and representations based on discrete series are simply discarded).
furthermore, none of the available attempts treats the problem of the innite degeneracy
at each string level, or enlightens the issue of modular invariance. in particular, the role
of the magnetic eld v remains obscure. the possibility of interpreting it as a continu-
ous twist, similar to those that appear in the parafermionic constructions, has never been
exploited. one might, though, relax in this way the constraint of modular invariance: the
latter should be recovered only after an appropriate summation over v (like in the case of

13see [26]. in that spirit, su (1, 1)/u (1) has been recently revisited [27]. remember that su (1, 1)/u (1)
was analysed in [28] as an internal conformal eld theory for a string compactication. unitarity was proved,
provided k/2  j < 0. later, su (1, 1)/u (1) was reinterpreted as a two-dimensional black hole [29], and the
spectrum was studied in [30]. this could also be a source of inspiration for su (1, 1) itself, by considering
(su (1, 1)/u (1))  u (1). there are many ways to dene the latter, with various geometrical interpretations
 when available [19, 31].
14a similar viewpoint was somehow taken by the authors of [32]. their subsequent developments were,
however, quite ad-hoc, and the net result for the partition function looks more like an analytic continua-
tion of an su (2)k invariant than like a true amplitude computed from rst principles in the theory under
consideration.

13

the two-dimensional euclidean black hole [6]).

finally, a somewhat more exotic attitude15 with respect to the unitarity could be to
simply admit the presence of negative-norm states in the physical spectrum, and then try
to interpret them or, better, to identify the instability they are related to and its physical
origin within the ads3 background. following this line of thought, one could even reconsider
the  non-unitary  models based on the admissible representations of the su(1, 1) current
algebra; their partition function is known, and one should then try to understand them in
the framework of string theory.

let me emphasize once more that the motivations for studying the string on ads3
are wider than expected in the early works. they include the string motion in a three-
dimensional black hole [35], which settles the proper framework to address the black-hole
evaporation problem. instead of a nsns torsion background, coupling to non-perturbative
rr charges is also a relevant and dicult problem [36]. finally, the analysis of the
ads/cft conjecture, in the framework of the ads3s3 background16, is probably the
issue that has attracted most attention. ideally, we would like to compute correlators in
both sides and compare them.
in practice, correlators for ads3 string states are out of
reach, which makes any rigorous check quite intricate. therefore, most of the work in that
direction has been devoted to trying to express the space-time as well as the asymptotic
two-dimensional conformal symmetry, in terms of the elds of the wzw model whose tar-
get space is the bulk ads3 theory, and to build in that way the boundary conformal eld
theory. it is fair to say, however, that this approach has not shed any light on the struc-
ture of the ads3 string itself  at least regarding the questions raised here; as long as one
does not handle the ads3 side exactly, the achievements are limited both on checking the
ads/cft correspondence, and on building the boundary theory [11]. of course, there is
still the  weaker  alternative to work with the low-energy supergravity, supplemented with
all kaluzaklein excitations coming from higher dimensions, thus trying to obtain some
feedback for the string on ads3. for example, there are signs that all su(1, 1) represen-
tations  discrete and continuous  should appear without bound on the mass. if such a
bound were present, assuming the ads/cft correspondence, it would be hard to identify
states in the bulk ads3 supergravity (or string, as a fundamental theory), with states in the
boundary conformal eld theory.

as a last comment, i would like to stress that string theories on more general adsn
backgrounds are equally important and more dicult than the three-dimensional case at
hand.
in odd dimensions, it has been realized very recently that both an antisymmetric
tensor and a linear dilaton are needed together with the gravitational background, in order
to dene an exactly conformal sigma model describing the string [37]. this sigma model is not
a wzw model, and its spectrum and interactions remain quite unexplored. furthermore,
the exact conformal eld theories describing the string propagation on even-dimensional

15an even more marginal alternative would be to drop the requirement of modular invariance, and simply
face the stringy exclusion principle [34]. it is hard to believe that this could be the end of the story, since
so many features of string theory, such as the ir/uv duality, strongly rely on modular invariance.

16notice that ads3s 3 modded out by some discrete symmetry might be more tractable than ads3s 3

itself, in particular when we demand supersymmetry.

14

anti-de sitter spaces have never been investigated. notice also that some issues, such as the
level-by-level innite degeneracy, or even the unitarity problem, will be generically present.
