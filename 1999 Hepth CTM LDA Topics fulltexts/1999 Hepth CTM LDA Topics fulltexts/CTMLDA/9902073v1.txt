abstract

we discuss the gauge theory mechanisms which are responsible for
the causal structure of the dual supergravity. for d-brane probes we
show that the light cone structure and killing horizons of supergrav-
ity emerge dynamically. they are associated with the appearance of
new light degrees of freedom in the gauge theory, which we explicitly
identify. this provides a picture of physics at the horizon of a black
hole as seen by a d-brane probe.

1 introduction

given the conjectured dualities between supergravity and gauge theory [1, 2],
it is natural to ask how the causal structure of supergravity arises from gauge
theory. in particular we would like to understand  from the gauge theory
point of view  why objects in supergravity must move on trajectories that
stay within their future light-cones.

this question is non-trivial because supergravity generally lives in a space-
time with more dimensions than its gauge theory dual. the extra dimensions
of supergravity correspond to the moduli space of vacua of the gauge theory.
the moduli space carries a euclidean metric, with no a priori restriction on
how fast an object can travel on it. so some dynamical mechanism must be
present in the gauge theory to enforce causality for motion on the moduli
space. the question can be sharpened by turning on a temperature. this
modies the causal structure of the supergravity background, through the ap-
pearance of a black hole with a non-degenerate horizon. how is this change
in causal structure reected by the dynamics of nite-temperature sym?

we rst consider supergravity probes, such as dilaton wavepackets in
ads5, which map to objects that move on the base space of the gauge theory.
for such probes the supergravity causal structure arises from kinematics in
the sym: causality in supergravity is related to the causal structure on the
base space by the uv/ir correspondence. then we turn to d-brane probes,
made by breaking the gauge group to su(n) u(1). these probes move on
the moduli space of the gauge theory. we show that the restriction on their
velocities arises dynamically, through the appearance of a new light degree of
freedom in the gauge theory: a w pair becomes light as the velocity of a brane
probe approaches the local speed of light. as a closely related phenomenon,
we also discuss the limiting electric eld on a d-brane probe. finally, we
turn to black holes, and show that an isolated w particle becomes massless
at the horizon. this makes contact with our previous proposal [3], where we
argued that a non-extremal horizon is detected by a d-brane probe as the
onset of a tachyon instability[4].

to support these claims we use the sym  supergravity correspondence
to indirectly calculate the mass of a w in sym, along the lines of the wilson
loop computations pioneered in [5, 6]. but in the nal section of this paper
we perform an explicit diagrammatic calculation of the mass of a w . the
diagrammatic calculation is valid at suciently high temperature (at the
edge of the region of correspondence with supergravity), and shows that at
least in this special region these claims follow directly from the sym itself.

2 supergravity probes of ads5 causality

we begin with supergravity probes of ads5  s5. this is a simple example
in which the light cone structure of the supergravity arises from kinematics
of the gauge theory. the metric and dilaton are

elds, at rest on the s5, but with some velocity in the u direction. this
velocity must satisfy

in order that the object not move on a space-like trajectory.

how does such a restriction arise in the sym? the dual su(n) gauge
theory lives on the boundary of ads5 with coordinates (t, x||). a super-
gravity excitation at a radial coordinate u corresponds via holography to an
excitation in the sym with size [7, 8]

x|| =

.

(3)

this has been discussed very explicitly for dilaton wave-packets in [9].

as the supergravity probe moves in the u direction its size changes in
the sym. translating the supergravity condition (2) into gauge theory terms
using (3), one nds that causality in supergravity implies the restriction

< 1 .

but this is just the statement that in the gauge theory the size of an excita-
tion cant change faster than the speed of light. an equivalent observation
has been made by susskind [10], that the time for a supergravity excitation
to propagate directly across ads space is equal to the time for a sym excita-
tion to travel around the boundary of ads. other discussions of ads/cft
causality have been given in [11, 12].

so for supergravity probes causal propagation arises as a consequence of

kinematics in the sym, via the uv/ir relationship (3).

3 d-brane probes of causality

we proceed to study the mechanisms which enforce causality on the motion
of a p-brane probe in the near-horizon geometry of an extremal black p-
brane. the dual theory is p + 1 dimensional sym in a certain range of
couplings [13], higgsed to su(n)  u(1). we will show that causality is
enforced dynamically, through the appearance of new light degrees of freedom
in the gauge theory at a limiting velocity. we also discuss the closely related
phenomenon of a limiting electric eld.

3.1 causality and the dbi action

to establish a framework for our subsequent discussion, we begin by exam-
ining the supergravity eective action for a p-brane probe. this is given by
the dbi action together with chern-simons couplings.

s = tpz eq det(g + b + f ) +z c

(6)

in the dual sym one considers an su(n + 1) gauge theory broken down to
su(n)  u(1) by a higgs vev . this gives rise to massive ws which are in
the fundamental of su(n) and charged under the u(1). we allow  to be
time dependent, and also allow a u(1) electric eld on the brane.1

the eects we will discuss correspond to the restriction that the action
(6) be real, det(g + b + f ) < 0. we would like to understand how this
bound arises from sym dynamics.

we rst consider the case b + f = 0, where the bound corresponds to
the condition for the probe to travel inside its future lightcone. the action

1a higgs vev cant be time dependent in innite volume, so we should think of the

branes as compactied on a large torus.

(9)

this is somewhat surprising from the sym point of view, since the moduli
space does not carry a causal structure, and there is no a priori kinematical
restriction on how fast a probe can move.

next we consider the case of a brane at rest but with a u(1) electric eld
i turned on on its worldvolume. this situation is closely related, since an
f0
electric eld maps to velocity under t-duality. from (6) one sees that there
is a maximal eld strength

xi (cid:16)f0

i(cid:17)2

< 1 .

(10)

we seek to understand the sym origin of these restrictions.

all these restrictions arise because the probe action has a born-infeld
term, which becomes singular when the velocity or electric eld gets too
large2.
in string theory, the born-infeld action is the eective action for
massless open strings.
it arises from integrating out massive open string
states at tree level. in general we expect a singularity of an eective action
to reect the fact that a new degree of freedom is becoming light. such a
phenomenon is well-known in the context of open string eective actions:
in at space, above a critical limiting value of the electric eld, an open
string with oppositely-charged ends develops a tachyon instability [14, 15].
intuitively, when the electric eld becomes larger than the string tension the
string is unstable and stretches indenitely.

2the eective action is nite but non-analytic when the limiting velocity is approached.
but making a legendre transform one sees that the hamiltonian diverges at criticality:
the vacuum energy of the sym blows up.

4

the born-infeld action is also expected to arise as the eective action of
sym at large n [16, 17, 18]. when written in terms of the t hooft coupling
note that the supergravity result (7) is o(n). so it should come from a sum
of planar diagrams with the topology of a disk, where a w runs around the
boundary of the disk and is dressed by su(n) degrees of freedom that ll in
the interior. the fact that the resulting eective action is non-analytic at a
critical velocity or electric eld suggests that some degree of freedom which
was integrated out becomes light at the critical eld.

it is instructive to regard this non-analyticity as a breakdown of pertur-
bation theory. the sym eective action has a double expansion in v2/4
and g2
e = e2/3p [16]. the diagonal terms in this expansion are expected
to re-sum to give the dbi action (7). at weak coupling, where g2
e  1 and
a one-loop calculation is reliable, the perturbation series breaks down when
the velocity expansion diverges, at v2/4  1. this is understood as a failure
of the born-oppenheimer approximation: w pair creation becomes possible,
and gives an imaginary part to the eective action [19, 20, 21]. on the other
hand, at strong eective coupling g2
e  1, it is expected that the pertur-
ev2/4
bation series breaks down when the diagonal expansion parameter g2
becomes of order one: this is the point (9) at which the dbi action is singu-
lar. note that at strong coupling the diagonal expansion breaks down while
the velocity expansion is still good, since v2/4  1/g2

ef f  1.

as we will show in the next section, the state which becomes light as the
probe velocity or electric eld is increased is a pair of w s, neutral under the
su(n)u(1). the mass of an isolated w remains large; it is the interaction
between them that makes the pair light.

3.2 w masses at strong coupling

we want to argue that a w -pair becomes light as the velocity or electric eld
approaches criticality. this could in principle be studied directly in the sym
by summing planar diagrams. in section 5 we will carry out a diagrammatic
calculation, valid for suciently high temperatures, but for now we take an
indirect approach, and use the correspondence with supergravity to compute
the energy of a pair at strong coupling.

we do this by adopting methods introduced in [5, 6] to compute wilson
lines in large-n gauge theory. from the point of view of string theory, the
worldline of a w is the boundary of a string worldsheet which has been
attached to the probe d-brane. the action for the w worldline can be
computed by evaluating the worldsheet action for the corresponding string.
at large n and large eective coupling we can treat the worldsheet classically,

5

ignoring uctuations and string loop corrections.

we consider several instructive examples, which are soluble and serve
to illustrate the qualitative behavior we expect in more general situations.
first we examine the behavior of a w pair in an electric eld on a brane at
rest. this provides a guide to the general behavior a string worldsheet in the
backgrounds of interest. then we consider a w pair on a moving brane. for
a particular choice of brane trajectory we can solve for the string worldsheet,
and show that the pair becomes massless exactly at criticality. finally we
study an isolated w on a brane moving along an arbitrary trajectory, and
show that its mass remains large even as the velocity is increased. although
we explicitly treat the case of an ads5 background, the same calculations
can be done for any p-brane.

3.2.1 w -pair in an electric eld

we seek the classical worldsheet of a fundamental string that starts and ends
on a d3-brane which is located at a xed position u = uf and has an electric
1 turned on in the x 1 direction. we look for a static solution to
eld e = f0
the equations of motion using the ansatz

x 0 = 
x 1 = l
u = u()

  <  < 
0    

this treatment is essentially identical to [5, 6]; the only new observation is
that by including an electric eld we can stabilize the static solution at a
nite value of uf .

the worldsheet action is nambu-goto plus a boundary term.3 evaluated

(13)

(14)

(15)

as the electric eld is increased u0 gets larger, so the string stays closer
to the 3-brane. however equation (12) tells us that at the same time l has
to decrease, and at the critical electric eld e = 1 in fact l goes to zero.
this behavior may be an artifact our static ansatz.

3.2.2 solution at criticality

consider a brane moving along a trajectory u = (x 0), and make the
following ansatz for a string worldsheet.

x 0 = 
x 1 = l
u = ( )

this describes a segment of string lying entirely within the the brane world-
volume. the string equations of motion are satised provided the brane
trajectory obeys

(16)

when this condition is obeyed the system is at criticality. note that the
length of the string in the x 1 direction l remains arbitrary. also note that
when the velocity of the brane equals the local speed of light the electric eld
necessary to stabilize the string endpoints vanishes.

when the boundary conditions (16) are satised the bulk and boundary
actions exactly cancel, showing that a w pair becomes massless at arbitrary
separation in a critical eld.

3.2.3 mass of an isolated w

as we have seen, a w pair becomes massless when the electric eld and
velocity become critical. this could occur in the gauge theory for two distinct
reasons: either the mass of an individual w particle goes to zero and the
interactions are small, or the mass of a single w remains nite but a large
interaction potential cancels the rest energy of the pair.

to decide between these possibilities we study a single w in isolation.
this is easiest in the velocity case, with vanishing electric eld. an isolated
w can be obtained from a w pair by sending the separation l   while
holding the velocity xed. as can be seen in the example of section 3.2.1, at
large l the worldsheet will tend to adopt a conguration in which the string
stretches from the brane close to the horizon at u = 0 and then travels along
the horizon before returning back out to the brane.5

4this is not physically possible in supergravity, of course, but we are only using this

solution to understand how the same bound arises in sym.

5for an extremal background we expect the classical string worldsheet to change

8

this means that we can compute the mass of an isolated w -boson by
studying the worldsheet of a string that stretches straight from the brane to
the horizon. such a solution is easy to obtain:
for a brane moving on an
arbitrary trajectory u = (x 0) the string worldsheet is

x 0(, ) = 
1


u(, ) =

( )

evaluating the nambu-goto action for this worldsheet one nds

s = 

1

2 z dx 0 (x 0) .

the w -boson is at rest in the gauge theory, so we can directly read o its
(time-dependent) mass: mw = 1

2 .

note that mw is given in terms of the instantaneous higgs vev by the
usual formula, without any corrections due to the velocity.
in particular
mw remains nite as the velocity of the brane approaches the speed of light.
this means that the phenomenon discussed above, of a w pair at some xed
separation becoming light at the critical velocity, must be understood as due
to a large interaction energy between the two w s, which cancels their rest
energy in the limit of critical velocity.

given that w pairs become light as the velocity or electric eld is in-
creased, it is natural to wonder if large amounts of pair production will take
place. we feel that pair production remains highly suppressed below criti-
cality, for reasons that are simplest to explain for electric elds. note that
although the energy of a w pair becomes small, the mass of an isolated w
remains large, so the pair is not completely free to separate in the electric
eld. indeed the static classical solution (12) suggests that as the electric
eld is increased the two w particles are forced to move closer together.
this reduces their dipole moment, which makes them very weakly coupled
to the electric eld. from the point of view of string theory, apart from the
fact that pair production is suppressed by gs  0, the w pair corresponds
to a neutral string, which further suppresses pair production [19]. so we do
not expect much pair production to take place as long as the eld is below
critical.

pair production should set in above the critical eld. for classical strings
this happens abruptly, as soon as the electric eld exceeds the critical value.
but it would be interesting to understand whether quantum eects can
smooth out the transition. this is an issue of 1/n corrections to the gauge

smoothly as l increases, but at nite temperature the minimal-action worldsheet changes
discontinuously at a nite value of l [23, 24].

theory. the classical computations we have performed are only valid in the
strict n   limit. at nite n the su(n) degrees of freedom can uctuate,
and it seems reasonable that this corresponds to the light-cone uctuations
expected in quantum gravity.

4 d-brane probes of horizons

it is interesting to extend our discussion of causality to include nite tem-
perature eects. on the supergravity side, nite temperature modies the
causal structure of the spacetime, through the formation of a black hole with
a non-degenerate horizon. the presence of this horizon must somehow be
reected in the nite-temperature dynamics of sym.

to be more precise, we wish to address the following question. the dual
gauge theory selects a preferred set of coordinates for supergravity. the
time coordinate of the sym corresponds to a timelike killing vector of the
supergravity background.
in supergravity this killing vector can becomes
null, at so-called killing horizons. for example, this always happens at the
event horizon of a black hole [25], and it also happens in ads5 at u = 0 (which
is not a true event horizon). what is the signature of a killing horizon in
the gauge theory?

to study this we place a d-brane probe at some higgs vev  in the gauge
theory. our proposal is that when the value of the higgs vev corresponds to
the position of a killing horizon, the mass of a w goes to zero in the gauge
theory. note that we are talking about a single isolated w particle, not the
w -pair discussed in the previous section.

this proposal originated in our earlier work [3], where we studied the
way in which a black hole absorbs and thermalizes a d-brane probe. we
argued that the w (mass)2 matrix has a zero eigenvalue when the higgs vev
takes the value  = 0 which corresponds to the position of the horizon6.
for non-extremal black holes we argued that there is a tachyon instability
for  < 0. the tachyon instability gives an imaginary part to the probe
eective potential, which causes absorption, and also makes it possible for
the probe to rapidly thermalize with the black hole. for extremal black holes
a w goes massless but no tachyon develops, and the absorption mechanism
is more plausibly string pair creation [3].

we rst consider the case of degenerate horizons (killing horizons with

6at nite n this is better thought of as the the position of the stretched horizon (see

the discussion section).

zero surface gravity7). for example, consider the near-horizon geometry of
an extremal black p-brane (5). the timelike killing vector becomes null at
u = 0. for a dp-brane probe this point indeed corresponds to the origin
of moduli space, where the w s become massless. another example is a d-
string probe of an extremal d1-d5-momentum black hole [26]. again the
timelike killing vector becomes null at the point which corresponds to the
origin of moduli space, and where new massless particles appear. these ex-
tremal black holes are supersymmetric, so no tachyon instability can develop,
which means that the thermalization rate for infalling matter is very slow [3].
but this is consistent with the fact that these degenerate horizons have zero
temperature.

let us now consider the non-degenerate killing horizons which arise for
non-extremal black branes. for simplicity we treat the near-horizon geometry
of a ten-dimensional 0-brane black hole, although the same discussion could
be given for any p-brane charge [13]. the string-frame metric and dilaton
are

the simple identication between the u coordinate of supergravity and
the higgs vev  of the gauge theory no longer holds when the black hole has

(20)

at extremality this reduces to the expected result  = u, and we see that an
extremal horizon indeed maps to the origin of moduli space. but away from
extremality the horizon corresponds to a non-zero higgs vev 0 = (u0)  u0.
note that the interior of the horizon u < u0 in supergravity corresponds to
imaginary higgs vevs in the gauge theory.

for non-zero velocity the physics here is essentially the same as in the previ-
ous section, with a w-pair becoming massless due to interactions when the
velocity approaches its limiting value.

but note that even for zero velocity the eective action (18) is singular at
the horizon, where h(u) vanishes.8 this signals the breakdown of the born-
oppenheimer approximation, but the breakdown is now due to an isolated
w becoming massless. to show this, we calculate the w-mass from the
nambu-goto action for an elementary string stretched between the probe
and the horizon, just as in section 3.2.3. for a brane located at u = (x 0)
this calculation gives mw = (  u0) /2. we see that a single w indeed
becomes massless at the horizon. extrapolation to  < u0 would give an
imaginary mass, since u becomes a timelike coordinate inside the horizon
(the higgs vev becomes complex).

5 perturbative calculation of the w mass

in this section we will discuss the evaluation of the w mass for a system
of d0-branes at a particular temperature, and show that it agrees with the
supergravity result for a black hole with the same temperature. the su-
pergravity is only valid up to black hole temperatures of order tc  e2/3,
because at this temperature the curvature at the horizon becomes of order
one in string units [13]. above this temperature the gauge theory is weakly
coupled. therefore at t  tc we should be able to qualitatively match
perturbative sym calculations onto supergravity calculations.

8the eective action as a function of  looks analytic, but (u ) is non-analytic at the

horizon.

to compute the nite temperature partition function of 0 + 1 dimensional
sym we make a gaussian approximation. at the temperatures of interest
we can ignore the fermions. thus we approximate the sym action by (in

frequencies  rrms, so the free energy is given by

f  n 2 log[2 sinh(2rrms)].

at high temperatures the gaussian approximation gives (t  e2/3)

rrms 

1
2

e1/2t 1/4

e  n 2t
s  n 2 log(t /e2/3)

(25)

(26)

this is the expected result, even for sym, since fermions can be ignored at
high temperatures. at low temperature it gives

rrms

e2/3

e  n 2rrms
s  n 2(t )

(27)

where (0) = 0 and (e2/3) = 1. the energy is just the ground state energy
of n 2 harmonic oscillators. notice that the ground state uctuations of the
bosonic degrees of freedom extend out to the edge of the region in which
supergravity is valid [10, 30].

the correct results at low temperature can be extracted from supergravity

correspondence [13].

clearly at low temperatures the fermions in the sym are crucial for cancelling
the ground state energy of the bosons. while inclusion of the fermions will
lower the ground state energy it cannot signicantly alter < tr x 2 >, so all
the interesting supergravity physics is inside the region of the bosonic ground
state uctuations.

we see that the supergravity results agree with the gaussian approxima-
tion for t  e2/3. at this point thermal uctuations are of the same order as
the quantum uctuations of the zero-temperature ground state. in the gaus-
sian approximation the tachyon instability radius (tir) can be computed as
in [3], and one nds

t ir|t =e2/3  e2/3  u0|t =e2/3 .

(29)

thus on the edge of validity of the supergravity description one can apply a
gaussian approximation to the sym. we nd that the horizon of the black
hole indeed coincides with the tachyon instability radius.

6 conclusions and discussion

we have analyzed the emergence of causal structure in supergravity in view
of the sym  supergravity correspondence. we have shown that for d-
brane probes the supergravity restriction, that they travel slower than the
local speed of light, arises dynamically in the gauge theory, through the
appearance of a light composite state of two w s. the same phenomenon
is responsible for the limitation on electric eld. we have also conrmed
that a killing horizon in the supergravity is associated with the w becoming
massless, and that with non-zero surface gravity the w has the possibility

14

of becoming tachyonic. it is amusing to see that whenever a d-brane probe
tries to move on a lightlike path, a massless mode appears in the sym. this
gives a coherent and simple picture of the origin of the supergravity causal
structure for d-brane probes.

we would like to comment on the picture of black hole physics that seems
to arise. it has been argued [31, 32] that there should be a unitary description
of black hole formation and evaporation from the point of view of an exter-
nal observer. for this to happen the semiclassical approximation to quantum
gravity (i.e. matter elds propagating on a xed background) should break
down near the black hole horizon even though the curvature there is small.
the black hole should have a stretched horizon, at a radius slightly larger
than the radius of the event horizon. hawking radiation emerges from the
stretched horizon which is endowed with the thermal properties of the black
hole. it can be shown [33] that the semiclassical approximation breaks down
if one uses spacetime foliations associated with outside observers.
in this
scheme the stretched horizon arises naturally as the locus of points where
the semiclassical approximation breaks down. it was also argued that the
description of physics as seen by observers falling into the black hole is com-
plementary to the description of the black hole as seen by the external ob-
servers.

in the supergravity  sym correspondence one identies the sym time
coordinate with the timelike killing coordinate outside the black hole horizon.
this means that the sym description of a black hole state corresponds to
an outside observers description of black hole physics. strictly in the large
n limit the sym corresponds to classical supergravity, and the stretched
horizon coincide with the event horizon, as there are no quantum eects
(including hawking radiation). this is the limit we have considered in this
paper. however, at large but nite n things will be dierent. at nite n
the thermodynamic limit is replaced by statistical mechanics, and uctua-
tions can occur. in particular the value of the tachyon instability radius will
uctuate. it seems natural to us to associate the outer limit of the tachyon
instability with the stretched horizon. this is why a probe will thermalize at
the stretched horizon, where the semiclassical approximation breaks down.
as the gauge theory develops a massless mode at the horizon, the ir/uv
correspondence suggest that physics there is inuenced by quantum gravity
eects.

below the higgs vev corresponding to the stretched horizon, the gauge
theory has no space time interpretation. instead the probe has entered a re-
gion where the non-abelian degrees of freedom control the physics. thus for
the outside observer the region behind the stretched horizon has no spacetime
interpretation, unlike the situation for an infalling observer.
