the ads/cft correspondence for the massive

rarita-schwinger field

abstract

the complete solution to the massive rarita-schwinger eld equation in anti-de sit-
ter space is constructed, and used in the ads/cft correspondence to calculate the
correlators for the boundary conformal eld theory. it is found that when no condi-
tion is imposed on the eld solution, there appear two dierent boundary conformal
eld operators, one coupling to a rarita-schwinger eld and the other to a dirac eld.
these two operators are seen to have dierent scaling dimensions, with that of the
spinor-coupled operator exhibiting non-analytic mass dependence.

1 introduction

the maldacena conjecture [1] asserts that there exists a holographic correspondence [2]
between eld theories on d + 1-dimensional ads space and conformal eld theories on the
d-dimensional boundary of this space. this correspondence has been made more precise in
[1, 3, 4, 5, 6] and investigated for specic cases in [7]-[17]. we do not attempt to give a
comprehensive list of references here, but refer the reader to the literature. a recent review of
the maldacena conjecture can be found in [18]. according to this correspondence principle,
the action for the eld theory in the bulk ads space written in terms of the boundary

values of the elds serves as a generating functional for a eld theory which lives on the at
boundary space. this can be written

zads[(0)] =z(0) dei[] = zcf t [(0)] =derads ddxo(0)e

(1)

where (0) is the boundary eld, and acts as a source for the operator o. since we deal in
the present case with a classical eld, we obtain an approximation to the path integral.1

we will choose the ads metric to be g = 1

x02  so that the boundary is at x0 = 0.
since the metric diverges on this boundary, we must regularise by multiplying by a function
with a suitable zero on the boundary. [5] the fact that this function is otherwise unspecied
is the origin of the conformal invariance in the boundary eld theory.

of particular interest here are [12, 13, 16, 17] which also deal with the rarita-schwinger
eld, but impose restrictions on the solution of the eld equation. we construct the general
solution and nd that when no such restrictions are imposed, there appear two elds on the
d-dimensional boundary; both a dirac spinor and a spin 3/2 rarita-schwinger eld couple
to boundary conformal eld operators, which as a result have dierent conformal scaling
dimensions. to nd these conformal eld correlators, we use the dirichlet boundary value
problem method exhibited in, for example, [9] for the case of a dirac spinor eld. since the
action vanishes on-shell, a surface term must be added.2 two equivalent methods [19, 20]
of determining this term have been investigated, and the method of [20] has recently been
used in [17].

in following this prescription, we solve the equations of motion in section 2. the surface
term to add to the action is found using the method of [20] in section 3, and nally in section
4 the cft correlators are calculated. these correlators are xed, up to a multiplicative
factor, by conformal invariance [21, 22]. the results obtained are consistent with these
considerations.

2 solving the classical eld equations

although the equations of motion have been solved in [12] for the massless case, in [13] for
the case of  = 0, and somewhat more generally in [16], we nd it necessary to construct
1an investigation of the ads/cft correspondence which deals with quantum corrections in given in [10]
2the equations of motion, of course, do not change.

explicitly the complete solution to the massive3 case while imposing no restrictions.

our index conventions are , , ... = 0...d and i, j, ... = 1...d. we choose the metric of
adsd+1 to be g = 1
x02  so that ads space is given by x0 > 0. the boundary with which
we shall be concerned is at x0 = 0, where the metric is singular. the rarita-schwinger
action is given by

i =z dd+1xg[d  m1g  m2]

(2)

d denotes the covariant derivative,  are curved space dirac matrices so that  = ea
a
where {a, b} = 2ab are euclidean dirac matrices, which are taken to be hermitian, and
the vielbein is given by ea
. more than one index on these matrices indicates antisym-
metrisation (including 1/n!). varying the above action gives the rarita-schwinger equation

 = 1

x0 a

and its conjugate

[d  m1g  m2] = 0

[d  + m1g + m2] = 0

we will nd it convenient to write the former in the equivalent form

[d  d] +

m+
d  1

  m = 0

(3)

(4)

(5)

which can be seen by using  = 1
we rst contract with d to obtain

2(  ). to solve this equation generally,

[d, d]  2m1d  m2d[] = 0

the commutator [d, d] can be expressed as

[d, d] =(cid:18)1

space is maximally symmetric [24]. we nd

 ab. the computation of r is simplied if we make use of the fact that the

r =

and in our metric r = d(d + 1) so that

[d, d] =

d(d  1)

and (6) becomes

m2d/() + md +

d(d  1)

 = 0

now we contract (3) with . using  = (d  1) we nd

m1 + dm2

d/()  d +

1  d

combining (11) and (12) to eliminate d, we obtain a dirac equation

(14)

and for convenience we have dened m = m1  m2. it can also be shown from (11) and
(12) that m1 = 0 implies  = 0. since this case has been considered in [12] and [13], we
assume m1 6= 0.

now we specialise to our coordinate system and write (13) as

0  c(cid:19)    = 0
where we will now work only with the components a  e

(cid:18)x0/ 

d

(15)

this equation has been solved in [9] by dierentiating to obtain a second-order equation,

and has the solution which does not diverge as x0

where a(1) and a(3) are spinors which do not depend on x0. since this form of the solution
was found via a second order equation, equation (16) needs to be substituted back into the
rst-order equation (15) in order to nd these spinors. we write x = (x0, x), and we will
work in fourier space with respect to the non-zero-index components of the eld,

(x0, k) =z ddxeikx(x)

(17)

since we will soon need to work with several other rst-order equations and doing the full
calculation every time would be tedious, we calculate the following formula

where p, l, n, q are arbitrary constants, the a are spinors which may depend on k, and from
now on we omit the arguments (kx0) of the bessel functions. our present case of

(note that we re-use the parameters a(1), a(2), a(3), a(4) each time we do a calculation with
(18).) reading o the lhs of (21) as the rhs from (18) with p = m, q = c, n = d
2 + 1, l =

2 and matching the coecients of the linearly independent functions of kx0 with those on
the rhs of (21), we obtain equations which can be solved for the a parameters. the result
is

the homogeneous version of (21) is exactly the same as (15) but with d

the form of the solution to the conjugate equation (4) may be found by conjugating this
result. care must be taken when dening the bar operation. we dene it in the following
way,

where m  m means that we change the sign of both m1 and m2. under this operation,
m  m, m+  m+, c  c, 1  2, and 3  3. it is of special importance to
realise that  and  are independent quantities; taking the conjugate of  in this way only
gives the form of the solution for , and the resulting arbitrary functions bi(k) and b0(k) will
be unrelated to bi and b0. in all other cases, the operation of conjugation will produce not
independent quantities, but conjugated ones. we will make frequent use of this notation in
the remainder of this paper.

3 adding a surface term to the action

along the lines of [20] we vary the action (2) and examine surface terms which do not vanish
when the equations of motion (3), (4) are satised. this has been done in [17] and the result
is that the term we need to add to the action is, in the notation of [20],

c =

1

2z ddx(cid:0)i(0)i(0) + i(0)ijj(0)(cid:1)

thus when we insert the classical solution into the action, only this surface term remains
and it can be written in the form

(37)

(38)

i =

1

2z ddk

(2)d(cid:0)i(0)(k)i(0)(k) + i(0)(k)ijj(0)(k)(cid:1)

we shall use this in the next section to calculate the correlators. this amounts to doing the
k-integral in (38) and taking the   0 limit. as observed in [9], this must be done with
care by formulating a dirichlet boundary value problem not simply at x0 = 0 but at  and
taking the limit at the end.

4 boundary cft correlator

in the case of a spinor eld [9], it was found that as the boundary at x0 =   0 is
approached, + and  are related by a factor of some power of  with the consequence that
one may be specied on the boundary, while the other must vanish. since we will nd the
same behaviour in the present case, we split the eld into two parts, + and . we now
set about inverting (35) to write the parameters bi and b0 in terms of the boundary elds
i(k), which we will abbreviate as i. from (35) we have

multiplying (39) from the left by i and alternately by ki
k gives two equations which can
be solved simultaneously for b0 and k  b in terms of i. we note that in contrast to [16],
where a similar parameter b0 cannot be determined in terms of the boundary data and is
arbitrarily set to zero, b0 here can be written in terms of the boundary eld. substituting
b0 back into (39) now allows us to solve for bi. inserting these expressions for b0, k  b, and
bi into (40), 
i . since the b parameters are eliminated in
this process, we are not free to impose any restrictions on them. the result is

it is now possible to write (38) in a simple form. we will, in (56) below, consider a case
and . this is easily done by

in which it is necessary to express (38) in terms of only 
means of (45) and (47). we break up the eld into + and  pieces

and then write the correlator as

ij(x  y) =z ddk

to perform the k-integral in (50), we must expand o and q (and thus each f ) and
determine the power of both k and  in each term. firstly, the terms containing an even,
non-negative power of k must be discounted, since they will vanish by the integral formula
(51). factors of the form ki do not pose a problem here; such a factor can be converted to
i(x)
, taking it outside the integral. secondly, we must keep only leading-order terms in  of
what remains. to this end we introduce the notation

i

g  kc+(k)km+(k)km+(k)

(52)

and since we will always deal with , ,  = 1/2, we abbreviate this further in an obvious
way. the rst four f functions may now be written as

where c1...21 are constants which can be read o from (43). only the following will be needed

(53)

c18 = c5 = c14 =

(1 + 1)(1 + 2)

c19 = (2m + 1)c18

(54)

now we use the small-argument expansion of the modied bessel function

(1 + . . . ) +

1
2

()(cid:16)z

2(cid:17)

(1 + . . . )

(55)

where the dots indicate successive even powers of z. clearly, which term we consider to be
leading-order depends on the order of the bessel function. to settle this point, from now on
we turn our attention to the specic case

m >

1
2

c < 

1

(56)

12

other cases may be considered in a similar fashion. a quick inspection of the f functions
shows that in this case, it is  which may be specied on the boundary, so we will need to
make use of (46) and (47), as mentioned above (49).

we apply (55) to obtain the leading-order term in the denominator d,

integrated due to their power of k, as explained above (52).5

(58)

in the expansion of this product, we will refer to individual terms by the signs of , , and
 in the exponent. by inspection it is seen that the  +  +  term is leading-order in ;
therefore we should ask whether this term will vanish when we do the k-integral.

table 1 shows on the lhs all instances, in (53), of the general term (58). it should be
noted that there are also factors of k1 which come from (42) and (46) so that, for example,
we should consider f4
k3 rather than just f4. on the rhs are the resulting powers of  and
k in the leading-order term in (58). we see that all elements in the table will vanish when
we integrate over k except the two entries indicating k2. however, when this part of f4 is
evaluated by substituting c18 and c19 from (54), we see that these two terms neatly cancel
each other. thus, the leading-order term in (58) will always vanish when we integrate. since
it cannot contribute, we must analyse the seven remaining higher-order terms to see which
do. by similar arguments we see that the next-order terms in (58) (for generic ) are
the    + ,  +   , and + +  +  terms. we will make no assumption as to

.
= functions in only the rst way since d is not integrated by itself.

5in the case of (57), the

13

whether c is larger or smaller in magnitude than m, so we must keep all three of these.6
it is also assumed that the masses are not special in that when we integrate a term of the
form k(masses), it does not vanish. considering again each instance of the general term (58),
we nd that the leading-order terms go as 2m and 2c, and that they correspond only to
the instances  =    and  = + + , both with p = 0.7 hence, the only terms in
(53) which will survive the   0 limit and the k-integration are the c1, c2, c5, c14, and
c19 terms,

writing out explicitly from (58) the terms which will contribute, according to the above

6actually, the  +    term turns out not to contribute anyway.
7the value of l in (58) does not matter here since it aects only the power of k which appears, and not .

where mi and mii are constants. the two correlators contained in this expression can be
separated by decomposing the boundary eld i into two parts, projecting out the compo-
nent orthogonal to i. to use the ads/cft correspondence (1), we dene the boundary
elds

(0)  jj

and

i(0)  i 

i
d

(0)

so that ii(0) = 0. the presence of the spinor eld (0) accounts for the correct number of
degrees of freedom coming from the original d + 1-dimensional rarita-schwinger eld.

rewriting in terms of these new elds, while absorbing appropriate powers of , gives us

two correlators, one for the conformal operator coupling to each boundary eld

(66)

and the scaling dimensions of the operators are oi = d

2 + m and o = d

2  c.

each of these correlators is seen to be of the form required by conformal invariance
[22]. the rst correlator (65) has been obtained previously but the condition  = 0
was imposed in [12, 13], and a parameter paralleling b0 set to zero in [16], with the result
that the second correlator was not found. our construction in section 2 of the solution to
the equations of motion involves no such restrictions, thus allowing both correlators (65)
and (66) to be obtained. it is interesting to note that since o depends on c, which is
proportional to 1/m1, the limit m1  0 is not well-dened. hence, the massless case cannot
be recovered in this limit.
