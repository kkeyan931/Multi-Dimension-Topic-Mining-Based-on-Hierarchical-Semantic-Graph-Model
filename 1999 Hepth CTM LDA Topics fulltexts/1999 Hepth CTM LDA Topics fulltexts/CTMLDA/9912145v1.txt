abstract

we consider several properties of a set of anti-dp-branes in the presence of orientifold
p-planes in type ii theory. this system breaks all the supersymmetries of the theory,
but is free of tachyons. in particular, we center on the case of a single anti-dp-brane
stuck at a negatively charged orientifold p-plane, and study its strong coupling
behaviour for p = 2, 3, 4. interestingly enough, as the coupling increases the system
undergoes a phase transition where an additional antibrane is created. we conclude
with some remarks on the limit of large number of antibranes on top of orientifold
planes.

1 introduction

in this paper we will be interested in the properties of a set of anti-dp-branes (denoted
dp-branes) in the neighbourhood of an orientifold p-plane (op-plane) in type ii string
theory (see [1] for early discussions on orientifolds, and [2] for a review). since the
antibranes and the orientifold projection preserve a dierent set of supersymmetries,
the system breaks all the supersymmetries of the theory, but it is free of tachyons.

the motivation to study these systems is two-fold. first, even though they are
non-supersymmetric, they are relatively simple. for instance, supersymmetry is
preserved (at lowest order) on the closed string sector, and bulk physics reduces
to that of type ii theory. these systems may therefore be a good laboratory to
continue extending our limited understanding of string theory and string duality in
non-supersymmetric situations. in fact, we will be able to extract information about
the strong coupling behaviour of these systems in particular cases. the second
motivation is that congurations with orientifold planes and antibranes appear in
the non-supersymmetric (but tachyon-free) type i compactications in [3] (see also
[4]). models of this kind exhibit certain phenomenologically interesting features, and
deserve further study. our comments in the present paper constitute a small step
towards dealing with some of the relevant issues in a simpler and more controlled
situation.

this note is organized as follows. in section 2 we make some remarks on the
perturbative properties of these congurations, and compute the leading contribution
to the interaction between antibranes and the orientifold plane, which is relevant
for the stability of the congurations.
in sections 3 we study duality properties
of these models, and in particular the strong coupling behaviour of a single dp-
brane stuck on top of a negatively charged op-plane, for p = 2, 3, 4. this is the
simplest non-supersymmetric orientifold conguration within our framework. using
dual descriptions we show that at strong coupling an additional antibrane is created.
section 4 contains some nal comments.

2 weak coupling description

recall the conguration of n dp-branes on top of an op-plane, which preserves
sixteen supersymmetries. there are two kinds of orientifold projections in string
perturbation theory, which dier in the sign of the contribution of the rp2 world-
sheet topology, and hence in the rr charge of the corresponding op-planes. we
denote by op-plane the orientifold plane with 2p4 units of dp-brane charge (as
counted in the covering space) 1. the massless open string modes produce a world-
volume gauge group g, along with the scalars and fermions required to ll a vector

1as further discussed in section 3, the op+-plane usually comes in two varieties, distinguished
by the value of a rr ux. since they are identical in perturbation theory, we will not distinguish
them in the present section.

multiplet of the corresponding supersymmetry. the group g is so(n) or usp(n)
for the case of op-plane or op+-plane, respectively.

let us consider instead a set of n dp-branes on top of the op-plane. before the
orientifold projection, the massless spectrum on the dp-brane world-volume consists
of a u(n) vector multiplet with respect to the sixteen unbroken supersymmetries.
as discussed in [4], the orientifold projection on the bosonic elds is just as for
dp-branes, while fermions pick up an additional minus sign 2. the world-volume
massless elds are given in the following table

n(n  1)/2 ; n(n + 1)/2
n(n  1)2 ; n(n + 1)2
n(n + 1)2 ; n(n  1)2

the quantum numbers are with respect to the so(p  1) lorentz little group, a
so(9  p) global symmetry (arising from rotational invariance in the transverse
space), and so(n) or usp(n) gauge group for op- or op+-planes, respectively
(notice that the symmetric representation of so(n) and the antisymmetric of usp(n)
are actually reducible). as is manifest from the spectrum, the system breaks all the
supersymmetries. however, and in contrast with the more familiar brane-antibrane
congurations, the spectrum contains no tachyons, since no annihilation can take
place.

due to lack of supersymmetry, the at directions of the scalar potential are
not protected against further corrections, which therefore control the stability of
the conguration. at leading order, they arise from the mobius strip, which is
the simplest world-sheet topology feeling the breaking of all supersymmetries. the
corresponding piece in the partition function is related to the interaction energy
between the op-plane and the dp-branes. the answer expected from long-distance
considerations (oppositely charged objects attract and equally charged objects repel)
turns out to be correct even at short distance, as we sketch in the following.

consider for simplicity a single dp-brane (and its image) located at a the position
~x in the (9  p)-dimensional transverse space. for a dp-brane the mobius strip
contribution would be given by (see [2] for conventions)

fers just in the sign of the r sector contribution (due to the additional sign in the 
action on spacetime fermions). therefore, it is given by minus two times the above

interaction between dp-branes and op-planes (resp. op+-planes), due to exchange
of massless closed string modes in the transverse 9  p directions. comparing (2.5)
with the brane-brane interactions in [2] the additional factor of 2p4 accounts for
the orientifold charge and tension.

this arises from the vacuum energy of world-volume elds coming from non-oscillator
open string modes. the divergence in the  function is simply due to the fact
that replacing f by its leading term does not account for the regularization by
oscillator string modes. in any event, the point to notice is that at short distances
the interaction is repulsive for op-planes and attractive for op+-planes.

therefore, the conguration of n dp-branes on top of an op+-plane is stable at
this order, and so at suciently small coupling. on the other hand, the conguration
of n dp-branes on top of an op-plane is unstable, with the exception of the case
n = 1, where the brane is stuck on the orientifold even at tree level. one might
worry about the consistency of the latter conguration, since it involves coincident
charges of the same kind. however, at short distances the interaction arises from
(2.6) rather than from the coulomb-like (2.5), and is nite for x = 0 3. we would
like to stress that the absence of short-distance divergences follows from the fact
that the model contains no open string tachyons, in contrast with brane-antibrane
systems, which are singular in that regime [5].

3more correctly, the original expression (2.2) is nite for x = 0

3 strong coupling behaviour

in this section we consider the strong coupling behaviour of the congurations of
antibranes on top of orientifold planes. for obvious reasons we will be more interested
in congurations which are at least perturbatively stable, and in particular we will
center on the system of a single dp-brane stuck on an op-plane.

we will base our arguments on string duality, which has been a useful tool in ana-
lyzing the strong coupling behaviour of supersymmetric congurations of dp-branes
and op-planes. the case of o3-planes has been discussed in [6] using type iib self-
duality (see also [7]), the m-theory lifts of o4-planes have been determined in [8]
(see also [9]), and those of o2-planes and o0-planes have been considered in [10] and
[11], respectively. useful information about other values of p can be extracted from
[12] for o5-planes, [13] for o6-planes and [14] for o7-planes. we expect these re-
sults to help in understanding duality properties in our non-supersymmetric models,
since the bulk is still supersymmetric, and its duality properties may extend to the
xed points of the orientifold action 4. in the following sections and for illustrative
purposes, we center on the particular case of o3-, o4- and o2-planes.

3.1 orientifold 3-planes

it will be useful to recall the situation for supersymmetric congurations of d3-branes
on o3-planes, studied in [6]. there are four types of supersymmetric congurations,
labeled by (n s, r), where n s, r = 0, 1
2 denote the eld-strength ux of the type
iib 2-forms in the transverse space (with the origin excised) rp5  r. the map
between the congurations and their uxes is

-plane is an exotic variety of the o3+-plane, diering from it in a rr-

in multiplets of the type iib sl(2, z) duality group. the sl(2, z) action on the
congurations follows from its action on the corresponding ns-ns and r-r uxes,
and underlies the montonen-olive duality properties of the n = 4 supersymmetric
gauge theories in the last column. setting p = 0, sl(2, z) also gives information
about the non-perturbative properties of o3-planes. for instance, their behaviour

4in other words, the orientifolding action in our models belongs to family 2 in the classication
in [15], where it was argued that the quotient theory retains the duality properties of the original
theory, i.e. orientifolding commutes with duality.

at strong coupling can be extracted from their duals under the   1/ trans-
formation. we thus learn that in the strong coupling limit the o3-plane and the
-plane are unchanged, whereas the o3+-plane turns into an o3-plane with a

+

stuck d3-brane, and vice-versa (as proposed earlier in [7]).

go3

let us now turn to the non-supersymmetric case of d3-branes on o3-planes. the
classication of these congurations is analogous to that in the supersymmetric case,
for the following reason. in the non-supersymmetric congurations, the transverse
space (after excising the origin) is also rp5r. moreover, as mentioned in section 2,
the non-supersymmetric theories dier from the sypersymmetric ones only in an
additional minus sign in the orientifold action on fermions. this means that fermions
pick up an additional minus sign in going along non-contractible 1-cycles in rp5,
but the bosonic properties of the background are unchanged at the classical level,
and so is the classication of uxes for the 3-form elds stregths. finally, since these
uxes are discrete, topological, this classication cannot be changed by quantum
corrections, even in the non-supersymmetric situation. therefore, we obtain four
types of non-supersymmetric congurations, as follows

recall that scalars transform in the adjoint of the gauge group, but fermions do
not. as in the supersymmetric case, these congurations must appear in sl(2, z)
multiplets, and therefore transform according to their ux structure. notice that in
the above table we have arranged the number of d3-branes so that congurations in
the same sl(2, z) multiplet have the same rr charge.

this leads to interesting proposals for the strong coupling behaviour of the con-
gurations. for instance, a conguration of n d3-branes on a o3+-plane, which is
stable at weak coupling, becomes unstable at suciently strong coupling, since it is
better described as a set of n + 1 d3-branes on a o3-plane at weak string coupling.
to stay on the safe side, in the following we center on a particular case which is stable
at weak and strong coupling (in the hope that it behaves nicely also in between),
namely the conguration of an o3-plane with a stuck d3-brane. this object has
charge  3
2 ). we propose
that at strong coupling this conguration turns into a set of two d3-branes on an
o3+-plane, which has the appropriate charge and ux structure. notice that in the
latter conguration, the d3-branes are bound to the o3+-plane due to the attractive
interactions discussed in section 2, and only in the extreme strong coupling they are
free to move o into the bulk (the dual coupling being strictly zero in this case).
hence this model presents an interesting transition between two mechanisms to bind
antibranes to orientifold planes (stuck antibranes vs. attracted antibranes).

a further bit of information supporting this proposal follows from the world-
volume perspective. even though the dynamics of the relevant eld theory is non-
supersymmetric and therefore intractable beyond weak coupling, certain quantities,
namely anomalies of global symmetries, should match in the weak and strong cou-
pling limit [16]. in the present case, there is a classical su(4) symmetry associated
to rotations in the six-transverse dimensions. in the conguration of an o3-plane
with an stuck d3-brane, the world-volume contains no bosonic elds, but there is a
fermion transforming in the fundamental representation of this su(4), and leading
to an anomaly. in the conguration of an o3+-plane with two d3-branes, there is a
gauge group usp(2), under which scalars transform in the adjoint, but under which
fermions are singlets. the latter transform in the fundamental of the su(4) global
symmetry. hence the anomalies for both congurations match, making our strong
coupling proposal plausible.

an intuitive explanation for the creation of an additional d3-brane would be as
follows. we start with one d3-brane stuck at an o3-plane. as the string coupling
becomes stronger, it becomes easier to nucleate d3-d3-brane pairs out of the vacuum.
since the real and the virtual d3-branes can pair up and move o slightly into the
bulk, the d3-brane can be considered more tightly bound to the o3-plane than its
companions. eventually, the coupling is strong enough so that the compound made
of one d3-brane and an o3-plane is better described as an o3+-plane. of course,
this picture is rather heuristic, but gives answers consistent with all constraints in
the system.

3.2 orientifold four-planes

+

supersymmetric congurations of d4-branes and o4-planes have been studied in [8],
where their m-theory interpretation is provided (see also [9]). there are four kinds
of congurations, which correspond to 2p d4-branes on an o4-plane, (2p + 1) d4-
branes on an o4-plane, 2p d4-branes on and o4+-plane or 2p d4-branes on an
-plane. they dier in the choice of eld-strength ux n s for the ns-ns 2-form,
and in the possibility of embedding the orientifold projection as a z2 wilson line
wr for the rr u(1) gauge eld, as in [17]. this information, the charges under the
rr 5-form, and the constraints of ux quantization in m-theory [18] are enough to
provide the m-theory lifts of these congurations, and therefore to study their strong
coupling limits. the result is as follows

the z2 acts by reection of the coordinates of r5, and, in the second and fourth
cases, by a half shift in the s1 coordinate. the m5-branes sit at the origin in
the r5 modded out by z2. in matching the m5-brane charges with the d4-brane
charges, one should take into account that xed points r5/z2 in m-theory carry 1
vebrane charge [19], while smooth geometries carry no vebrane charge. also, one
of the moduli in the m-theory conguration in the third line is frozen [8], by the
mechanism explained in [9].

we can repeat this exercise for the non-supersymmetric congurations of d4-
branes on o4-planes. as in the previous section, the classication in the supersym-
metric case can be carried out for our non-supersymmetric models. we can also pro-
pose suitable m-theory conguration which reduce to these type iia models, and are
consistent with ux quantization and other known properties of m-theory. it is mean-
ingful to consider such m-theory lifts because away from the non-supersymmetric ori-
entifold plane local physics is given by type iia physics. the following table should
then be understood as providing the appropriate m-theory objects to be placed in
the orientifold core region in the corresponding lifts

this information provides the strong coupling description of the congurations
of o4-planes and d4-branes. however and as usual, the most meaningful statements
are restricted to the stable systems, and in the following we center on the case of an
o4-plane with one stuck d4-brane. in the strong coupling limit, this conguration
is better described in m-theory, as two m5-branes in the background geometry r5 
(r5  s1)/z2. notice that the naive lift as one m5-brane in the background r5 
r5/z2  s1 is not consistent with the presence of non-zero wr in the iia model or
with ux quantization in m-theory.

notice that the two m5-brane in m-theory are presumably bound to the origin
in r5 due to attractive interactions. these cannot be computed at short distances,
given our ignorance about the fundamental degrees of freedom in m-theory, but at
long distances they reduce to the exchange of massless supergravity elds.

another interesting observation involving short-distance physics in m-theory is
that a phase transition seems to occur between the large and small radius limits.
starting at large radius, and trying to reach the weakly coupled type iia limit,
beyond a certain radius the geometry r5  (r5  s1)/z2 is better described as a
type iia o4-plane with an stuck d4-brane. the latter can thus annihilate with one

7

of the antibranes present from the beginning, leading to our familiar system of an
o4-plane with one d4-brane. this phase transition may imply that the m-theory
lifts of these congurations are not useful in obtaining even qualitative features about
gauge theories using brane congurations as in [20].

3.3 t-duality relations

in this section we would like to use t-duality to relate our proposals for the strong
coupling behaviour of non-supersymmetric o3- and o4-planes, with an analysis in-
spired in [9]. given the equivalence between type iib theory on a circle and m-theory
on a 2-torus, one can nd strong-weak coupling duals in type iib theory by obtaining
two dierent degenerations of the m-theory 2-torus. we illustrate this technique in
our non-supersymmetric orientifold context by considering type iib on r4  r5  s1
modded out by (1)fli, where fl is the left-handed world-sheet fermion number,
and i inverts all coordinates of r5  s1. the model contains two o3-planes, which
can be chosen of dierent type, and whose strong coupling behaviour can now be
derived from the m-theory realization. in the following we consider several examples,
with one o3-plane of type o3 + d3 and one supersymmetric o3-plane.

i) consider an initial conguration with an o3 + d3 system and an o3-plane,
with a transverse circle s1. its m-theory lift can be obtained by rst t-dualizing
to a type iia model, and then growing the m-theory circle s1.
in this case, the
iia model is an o4 + d4 wrapped on s1, and the m-theory lift corresponds to
two m5-branes in the geometry r4  s1  (r5  s1)/z2. a dierent type iib
description, corresponding to the strong coupling limit of the initial one, can be now
achieved by shrinking s1 rst and then t-dualizing along s1. shrinking s1 yields
two d4-branes in the geometry r4  (r5  s1)/z2, with a z2 action not embedded
as a u(1)r wilson line (wr = 0). the t-dual of this conguration is given by two
d3-branes and two oppositely charged o3-planes (see [14]), whose overall r must
be zero to agree with the vanishing type iia wr. the t-dual conguration hence
contains an o3+ + 2d3 system and an o3-plane, which precisely is the proposed
strong coupling limit for the initial conguration. notice that the location of the
d3-branes on top of the o3+-plane obeys dynamical reasons.

ii) let us start with an o3 + d3 system and an o3+-plane. the t-dual con-
guration corresponds to one d4-brane in the geometry r4  (r5  s1)/z2, with
wr = 1. its m-theory lift is therefore one m5-brane in the background geometry
r4  (r5  s1  s1)/z2, with the z2 acting with a simultaneous half-shift on both
circles. notice this model is invariant under exchange of both circles, hence shriking
s1 and t-dualizing along s1 takes us to a type iib model isomorphic to the initial
one. this self-duality is also obtained from our type iib analysis, but in a non-trivial
fashion. the strong coupling of the initial conguration is given, according to section
3.1, by an o3+ + 2d3 system and an o3 + d3 system. the two d3-branes are
attracted by the o3+, but more strongly by the d3-brane (stuck at the o3-plane).
hence the true vacuum is achieved only after annihilating a d3-d3 pair, and cor-
responds to an o3+-plane and an o3 + d3 system, as derived from the m-theory

8

argument. notice that the agreement in this case is surprisingly intricate.

-plane.
its t-dual is given by one d4-brane in the geometry r4  (r5  s1)/z2, and with
wr = 0. its m-theory lift is given by one m5-brane in the geometry r4  s1 
+ 2d4 system (this is more
easily understood by lifting the iia conguration, and annihilating a m5-m5 pair).
-plane,

iii) consider an initial conguration of an o3 + d3 system and one go3
(r5  s1)/z2. upon shrinking s1, we recover an go4
finally, t-dualizing to type iib, we recover an o3+ + 2d3 system and ango3

which agrees with our strong coupling proposal of the initial conguration.

+

+

+

iv) finally, consider an o3 + d3 system and an o3 + d3 system. the t-dual
iia model corresponds to one o4-plane with one stuck d4-brane and one stuck d4-
brane, with dierent wilson lines along the s1 they wrap, and with wr = 0. in m-
theory this is described as one m5-brane and one m5-brane on r4s1 r5/z2 s1,
with dierent wilson lines (actually, periods of the world-volume self-dual 2-form
on the m-theory 2-torus). after shrinking s1, we obtain a iia conguration of an
o4+ +2d4 system , with no wilson lines (again this is easier to understand by lifting
the iia conguration, and annihilating a m5-m5 pair with identical wilson lines).
the type iib t-dual contains an o3+ + 2d3 system and an o3+-plane, which agrees
with the strong coupling proposal for the initial model.

notice that the above arguments involve shriking circles in m-theory, whose treat-
ment is not completely rigorous in the absence of supersymmetry and so of the bps
property. therefore they rely in the assumption that supersymmetry away from the
orientifold core is enough to allow taking such limits. notice also that even though
the duality chains are quite constrained from mere kinematics, namely matching
of charges, uxes, etc (that is actually the reason that allows us to match non-
supersymmetric congurations) there is some role played by non-trivial dynamics, in
particular in the form of brane-antibrane annihilations, and of uncancelled antibrane-
orientifold forces. finally notice that in the above discussion we have ignored the
issue of the dynamics of the modulus associated to the circle radius, which in a more
detailed treatment should perhaps also be taken into account.

the above examples mainly center on our proposal for the strong coupling limit

of the o3 + d3 system. other examples can be studied analogously.

3.4 orientifold two-planes

we conclude this section with a brief discussion on the strong coupling description
of an o2-plane with one stuck d2-brane. the only ingredients required from the
supersymmetric case are the m-theory lifts of the o2-plane, the o2+-plane and the
o2 + d2 system, determined in [10]. they correspond to m-theory geometries of
the form r3  (r7  s1)/z2, where the z2 action reverses all the coordinates of
r7  s1. the model contains two xed points, locally of the form, r8/z2, and each
having one of two possible values of eld-strength ux for the m-theory 3-form. the
two possibilites endow the xed point with dierent membrane charges: 1/8 for

9

a singularity with vanishing ux and 3/8 for a singularity with non-zero ux. the
m-theory descriptions of the relevant o2-planes are

in our context of non-supersymmetric congurations of o2-planes and d2-branes,
we center on the particular case of the o2 + d2 system (other examples can be
worked out analogously). using our experience in similar systems in other dimen-
sions, we propose the correct m-theory lift is given by r3  (r7  s1)/z2 with two
xed points of charge 3/8 and two m2-branes.

in order to show that, we use t-duality with some familiar congurations of o3-
planes and d3-branes. consider an o3 + d3 system, wrapped on a longitudinal
s1, and perform a t-duality along it. the resulting type iia model contains an
o2-plane and an o2 + d2 system, with a transverse circle. the m-theory lift of
this conguration is given by r3  (r6  t2)/z2, with two m2-branes. there are
four xed points, two of which have charge 1/8 (from lifting the o2-plane) and
two have charge 3/8 (from our proposed lift of the o2 +d2 system). this m-theory
lift can be conrmed by rst s-dualizing the initial type iib model, and then lifting
it to m-theory. in the strong coupling limit, the initial iib conguration turns into
an o3+ with two d3-branes, wrapped on s1. its type iia t-dual contains two o2+-
planes and two d2-branes. its m-theory lift corresponds to r3 (r6 t2)/z2, with
two m2-branes, two xed points of charge 1/8 and two of charge 3/8 (since each
o2+ contributes with one xed point of each kind). this agrees with the m-theory
conguration found before, and supports our identication of the strong coupling
limit of the o2 + d2 system.

notice that the naive m-theory lift corresponding to m-theory on r3  (r7 
s1)/z2 with two xed points of charge 1/8, and with one m2-brane is not cor-
rect. in fact, having m2-branes (or m2-branes) stuck at r8/z2 singularities is not
consistent with ux quantization conditions.

we hope this example suces to illustrate the discussion of o2-planes, and spare
the reader an exhaustive treatment, already performed in the analogous case of o3-
and o4-planes.

4 final remarks

the purpose of this paper has been to explore some of the properties of systems
of dp-branes on op-planes of dierent kinds. we believe these congurations show

10

interesting features and non-supersymmetric dynamics, which nevertheless seem ac-
cessible to study (to a certain extent) due to the simplicity of the conguration.

a particular avenue, not directly exploited in this note, is to consider the limit
of a large number n of dp-branes on the orientifold planes 5. this approach would
be particularly useful to study the eld theories in the dp-brane world-volume, by
computing in the dual supergravity background in the sense of the ads/cft corre-
spondence (see [21] for a review). some results in this direction have appeared in [22]
for the case of m2-branes. for reasons already explained, the bosonic parts of the
corresponding supergravity backgrounds are identical to those in the supersymmetric
cases. for instance, for d3-brane on o3-planes, the background at leading order in
n is given by ads5 rp5, just as in the supersymmetric case in [6]. the supersym-
metry breaking eects arise because fermionic elds pick up an additional (1) in
going along non-contractible cycles in rp5, as compared with the supersymmetry-
preserving case 6. this eect is subleading in n, since it arises from the orientifold
projection, which is suppressed in the large n limit [24].
it would be interesting
to study 1/n corrections to dierent quantities in these type of backgrounds (for
instance, the subleading correction to the conformal anomaly, analyzed in [25] in the
supersymmetric case).

a dierent line of development would be to consider other values of p. in some
cases this would require improving our understanding of the dierent orientifold
planes even in the supersymmetric case. finally, it would be interesting to consider
more complicated congurations, by introducing new objects (e.g. additional branes
and/or antibranes) or orbifold projections. this would require further developments
in the study of the stability of additional moduli in the former case, and the appro-
priate treatment of uncancelled twisted ns tadpoles in the latter.

in any event, we hope our observations on these systems are useful as a starting

point for the investigation on these models.
