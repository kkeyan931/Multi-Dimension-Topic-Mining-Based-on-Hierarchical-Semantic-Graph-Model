abstract

we consider the scattering of relativistic electrons from a thin magnetic

ux tube and perturbatively calculate the order , radiative correction, to

the rst order born approximation. we show also that the second order

born amplitude vanishes, and obtain a nite inclusive cross section for the

one-body scattering which incorporates soft photon bremsstrahlung eects.

moreover, we determine the radiatively corrected aharonov-bohm potential

and, in particular, verify that an induced magnetic eld is generated outside

of the ux tube.

i. introduction

much eort has been devoted in recent years to fully understand the consequences as

well as the mathematical subtleties of the aharonov-bohm (ab) eect [1]. the motivations

range from dierent areas as low dimensional condensed matter physics (e.g. in the study

of anyons) [2] to cosmic string models [3] and have both experimental [4] and theoretical

overtones. the conceptual aspects are not less interesting as we briey illustrate. basically

due to the use of dierent boundary conditions, to achieve accordance between the exact and

the perturbative calculations in the case of spin zero particles, it was necessary to include

in the perturbative method a contact delta like interaction. in 2+1 dimensions, within the

chern-simons [5] eld theory approach, it was shown that the contact interaction may be

simulated by a quartic self-interaction of the matter eld, with a coupling tuned to eliminate

divergences and restore the conformal invariance of the tree approximation [6]. for the

scattering of two spin up fermions it was veried [7] that an additional self-interaction was

not needed since its role was provided by paulis magnetic term. however, if the fermions

had anti-parallel spins the eect of the magnetic interaction canceled and a divergence

showed up. these problems were studied in a relativistic quantum eld theory approach

[8, 9]. dierently from the non-relativistic calculations previously mentioned, without any

additional hypothesis, the scattering amplitudes are nite for both parallel and anti-parallel

spin fermions [9].

in this paper we extend these investigations by considering the ab scattering of spin

1/2 particles by an external ux tube, directly in 3+1 dimensions. we calculate the elastic

cross section, in rst order born approximation in the ab potential, including radiative

corrections up to order . the second order born approximation is also calculated and

found to vanish. infrared divergences of the elastic cross section, are eliminated from the

observable scattering process by considering the inclusive cross section, which besides the

elastic process, also incorporates soft photon bremsstrahlung contributions. the discussion

of vacuum polarization eects allows us to correct the original ab potential, showing a

2

screening of the magnetic ux and the induction of a magnetic eld outside of the original

ux tube.

the paper is organized as follows.

in sec.

ii we introduce the model, calculate the

rst order born approximation including radiative corrections up to order , calculate the

second order born approximation, and the nite inclusive cross section including soft photon

bremsstrahlung. in sec. iii we obtain, up to the same order, the radiatively corrected ab

potential, and the induced magnetic eld outside the ux tube. some comments are made

in the conclusions.

ii. radiative corrections to the scattering cross section

our starting point is the standard feynman gauge qed lagrangian [10]

l = [i( + iea + iea)  m] 
f = a  a.

where a(x) is the radiation eld and a(x) is the external ab potential (e = |e| is the
electron charge). the magnetic ux tube is located at the z-axis, and the ab potential can

be chosen as (the index t stands for transverse to the z-axis)

a(x) = (0, ~at(~xt), 0),

ai(~xt) =

where  is the magnetic ux1. the ab potential satises the coulomb gauge condition,

iai = 0, and in cylindrical polar coordinates it reads a() = 

2 .

starting from the lagrangian (1), there are in principle two ways to proceed: one could

try to construct the exact feynman propagator in the background potential (2), and then

1we use natural units (c = h = 1), and diag g = (+,,,). repeated greek indices sum from 0 to 3,
while repeated latin indices from the beginning and from the middle of the alphabet sum from 1 to 3 and

from 1 to 2, respectively. the antisymmetric tensor ij is normalized such that 12 = 1.

evaluate the radiative corrections to the scattering amplitude, or one can resort to a per-

turbative calculation both in  = e

4 .

in the present paper we will restrict

ourselves to the second approach. specically, we have to calculate the rst order born

amplitude in  plus radiative corrections up to order , hereafter designated by t1 and add

these contributions to the second order born amplitude in , designated by t2 (see gure

1):

it = it1  it2,
it1 = (ie)u(p, s)n + (q) + (q2) g(q2) oa(q) u(p, s),
it2 = ie2 u(p, s)z

(4)

since the scattering process conserves the energy and the z-component of the three-

momentum we will consider the case of incidence perpendicular to the solenoid. then,

in the above expressions p = (e, ~pt, 0), s and p = (e, ~p 
t , 0), s are the four-momenta
and helicities of the incident and outgoing electrons, respectively, with |~p| = |~p | = pt;
q = (p  p) = (0, ~qt, 0) is the momentum transfer from the ux tube. we choose a refer-

is the scattering cross-section in the rst order born approximation [3, 11, 12].

as it should, the scattering cross-section up to the order , eq. (19), displays helicity

conservation. the rst order born approximation agrees with the weak ux limit of the exact

quantum-mechanical ab scattering cross section of a spin 1/2 fermion given in [3,11,12], in

contrast with the results obtained for spinless particles [13].

since the electrical form factor f1 becomes infrared divergent as   0, it is necessary
to include the inelastic bremsstrahlung cross-section (see gures 1e and 1f) for soft photon

production in the (photon) energy range   e, where e << e is the typical energy
resolution of the detector. the calculations go along the same lines as in the coulomb

scattering case [10]. since we are only interested in the leading order terms in e

e << 1,
whenever allowed we shall take the limit e = e    e and |~p |  |~p|. with these
approximations the scattering cross section factorizes in the form (v = pt

as shown in gure 2, we have plotted r for three values of e. in that graph, contributions

near  = 0 have been omitted since the ab amplitude is not well dened there [14].

iii. radiative corrections to the aharonov-bohm potential

in this section we shall compute vacuum polarization eects (up to the order ) on

the renormalized ab potential. in particular, we will show that, as a result of radiative

corrections, a magnetic eld is induced outside the ux tube.

any external electromagnetic potential a is modied due to vacuum polarization eects.

if this is properly taken into account the eective ab potential (a) becomes

a(q) = (g  i


q2 ) a(q) = (1  (q2)) a(q)

(24)

as the origin is a highly singular point in the ab potential (2) , it is convenient to intro-

duce a regularization which distributes the magnetic ux on the surface of a thin cylindrical

shell surrounding the origin, similarly as done in [11] (b3(q) = (2)2(q0)(q3) b),

ai(xj) =

where r is the radius of the cylindrical shell. as r  0 we recover the ab potential of eq.
(2).

(30)

the integral in g(m) converges for  > r 6= 0, and is logarithmic divergent for  = r. a
numerical solution is feasible, with the result drawn in gure 3. the eective ux picture

resembles that of eective charge in qed. indeed, from the gure we see that the vacuum

uctuations lead to a screening of the ux, as a calculation of the induced magnetic eld

shows more clearly. the total induced ux at large distance is given by the limit    of
the formula

() = zc()

(31)

and it is found to vanish due to the asymptotic behavior of g(m) for large distances.

as r  0, it can be shown that avp

i (xj) has an exact solution in terms of meijers

g-function [15],

the asymptotic limits for m << 1 and m >> 1 can be calculated from eq. (32) (r = 0):

the rst term on the right hand-side of eq.(35) is the original magnetic eld in the cylin-

drical shell (b3), whereas the vacuum polarization part bvp

3 contains a highly concentrated

contribution on the shell of the same relative sign as b3, together with an external contribu-

tion in the opposite direction. in a semi-classical picture, this prole is expected since the

lines of the induced magnetic eld are closed. to determine the function (r) we use that

the total induced ux is zero. this gives (r) = 

32r g(mr).

it is possible to use eq.(32) to deduce the asymptotic limits for bvp

iv. conclusions

we have calculated the order  radiative corrections, to the scattering cross section of

an electron by an external ab potential, in rst born approximation. the second order

born approximation was also calculated and found to vanish, in agreement with the weak

ux limit of the exact quantum mechanical calculation (without radiative corrections). the

10

inclusive cross section, which besides the elastic scattering, also includes the soft photon

bremsstrahlung was calculated. the semi-classical, radiatively corrected ab potential due

vacuum polarization currents and using a nite radius ux tube model was also calculated

up to the same order. it was shown that an induced magnetic eld opposite to the original

ux tube is induced outside, which partially screens the original eld. we remark that our
perturbative results are expected to hold for | e

2| << 1.

we would like to mention some literature which have contact with our work. using the

solutions of dirac equation in the external ab potential, in reference [16] the processes of

pair production and bremsstrahlung were analyzed.

in [17] the induced vacuum current

was obtained. in these works the external ab potential was treated in an exact way, but

radiative corrections due to virtual photons were not included.

in our approach instead,

the ab potential was perturbatively treated but radiative corrections were also included.

it must be observed that our induced external magnetic eld can alternatively be obtained

from the induced vacuum current of [17], in the weak ux limit, through the use of the

ampere law. it must also be observed that the soft photon bremsstrahlung cross section,

that is part of our inclusive cross section may be get from the bremsstrahlung cross section

of [16] in the weak ux and soft photon limits. our radiative corrections due to virtual

photons instead, namely the contributions of the graphs in gures 1b and 1c, are new and

not included in these previous papers.

a more complete calculation of the ab cross section, in which radiative corrections are

perturbatively considered as corrections to the exact treatment of the ab scattering is yet

to be done.

lca would like to thank the mathematical physics department for their kind hospital-

ity. this work was partially supported by fundacao de amparo a pesquisa do estado de
