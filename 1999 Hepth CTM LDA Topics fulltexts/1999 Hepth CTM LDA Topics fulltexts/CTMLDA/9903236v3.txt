we provide a complete picture of the self-gravitating non-relativistic gas at thermal equilibrium
using monte carlo simulations (mc), analytic mean eld methods (mf) and low density expansions.
the system is shown to possess an innite volume limit, both in the canonical (ce) and in the mi-
crocanonical ensemble (mce) when n, v  , keeping n/v 1/3 xed. we compute the equation
of state (we do not assume it as is customary), the entropy, the free energy, the chemical potential,
the specic heats, the compressibilities, the speed of sound and analyze their properties, signs and
singularities. the mf equation of state obeys a rst order non-linear dierential equation of abel
type. the mf gives an accurate picture in agreement with the mc simulations both in the ce and
mce. the inhomogeneous particle distribution in the ground state suggest a fractal distribution
with haussdorf dimension d with d slowly decreasing with increasing density, 1 <

 d < 3.

the study of the self-gravitating thermal gas has both fundamental and practical physical interest[1, 2]: (i) it
possess remarkable thermodynamic properties due to the long range of the gravitational force [such properties never
occur in ordinary systems with short range forces]. (ii) it plays a central role in astrophysics and cosmology; cold
clouds in the interstellar medium and its remarkable observed scaling laws (from 104pc up to 100pc), as well as
galaxy distributions (up to 100  200mpc) can be described with it. (iii) it is relevant for the study of stellar objects
in the non-relativistic and relativistic cases.

the ground state is inhomogeneous and the usual thermodynamic limit: number of particles n  , volume
v  , with n/v xed leads to collapse into a very dense phase. the gaseous phase can only exist when n, v  
with n/v 1/3 xed. this is a diluted limit where the particle density n/v goes to zero as v 2/3. the appropriate
dimensionless variable (for particles of mass m at temperature t on a box of volume v ) is   g m2n
(it can be a
spherical or cubic box with volume v = l3 or v = (4/3)r3, respectively).  is related to the jeans length of the
gas dj through  = 3(l/dj)2. we call thermodynamic limit the limit n  , r   with a xed ratio r/n . in
this limit, physical magnitudes are expressed naturally as functions of .

l t

for small , the gas behaves as a perfect gas. for growing , p v /n t (where p is the pressure) decreases (see
gs.1-2) due to the attractive character of gravity. finally, at some critical crit the gas exhibits a sharp clumping
transition to a dense phase with negative pressure. the extension of the gaseous phase and the value crit depend
on the thermodynamical ensemble (see gs.1-2): the gas phase is larger in the microcanonical ensemble (mce) and
smaller in the canonical ensemble (ce). we investigate the self-gravitating gas with monte carlo (mc) and analytic
mean eld (mf) methods; in the dilute limit we expand in powers of . our results show that the ce and mce
yield the same results in their common range of the gaseous phase. the mf correctly describes the thermodynamic
limit except near the critical points, the mf is valid for n |  crit|  1. the vicinity of the critical point should be
studied in a double scaling limit n  ,   crit.

the particle distribution (~q) proves to be inhomogeneous (except for   1) and described by an universal
function of the geometry,  and the ratio ~r = ~q/r. d slowly decreases from the value d = 3 for the ideal gas ( = 0)
till d = 0.98 in the extreme limit of the mc point taking the value 1.6 at crit [see table 1]. the particle density in
the bulk behaves as (~q)  rd3. this indicates the presence of a fractal distribution with haussdorf dimension d.

p stands for the external pressure on the gas. notice that the equation of state p v = n t f () is here computed
from the gravitational interaction, we do not assume an equation of state as it is customary. it follows from eqs.(4)
and (6) that   = g() = 3 [f ()  1/2] and that the virial theorem, (3p v = 3
2 n t + e), holds both in the mce and
in the ce.

we nd that the following properties hold in the n   , l   limit provided  and  are kept xed:
(a) f () and g() reach nite limits. [in fact, xed  implies a nite limit for  and viceversa].
(b) the energy, free energy, entropy and p v are proportional to n (besides a log n term in the entropy as for an

ideal gas).

(c) both ensembles, the mce and ce yield the same physical magnitudes.
we have veried properties (a)-(c) in three ways. first, by direct calculation in the dilute regime (  1 ,   1)
by expanding eqs.(4) and eqs.(5) in powers of 1/ and  for the mce and ce, respectively. second, by performing
monte carlo simulations both in the mce and the ce. third, by mean eld approximations to eqs.(4) and eqs.(5).

this expression is valid in the thermodynamic limit both in the ce and mce. in the ce, the specic heat is related
to the uctuations of the potential energy (u )2 and it is positive dened,

dilute limit calculations.

for a dilute gas, we expand the integrands in eqs.(4) and eqs.(5) in powers of 1/ or , respectively. in the n  
limit the expressions simplify considerably. moreover, divergent integrals in the zero cuto limit are eliminated by
1/n factors. that is, after the thermodynamic limit is taken the cuto corrections are of the order o(a2) and clearly
vanish in the a  0 limit. we nd after calculation,

for a sphere of unit volume we nd bsph
0 = 0.19462 . . . .
notice that the cube and sphere values dier only by about 3%. we see from eq.(8) that the perfect gas behaviour
gets corrected by negative denite terms due to the attractive nature of the gravitational interaction.

correction to the ideal gas, 

1 = 153/35, whereas for a unit volume cube bcube

monte carlo calculations.

we applied the standard metropolis algorithm in a cube of size l with total energy e in the mce and at temperature t
in the ce. the number of particles n went up to 2000[7]. we introduced a small short distance cuto  103l106l
in the attractive newtons potential. all results in the gaseous phase were insensitive to the cuto value.

two dierent phases show up: a non-perfect gas for  < c, and a condensed system with negative pressure for
 > c. the transition between the two phases is very sharp, with a negative jump in the entropy from the gas to the
condensed phase. this phase transition is associated with the jeans instability.

we plot in gs.1-2 f () = p v /[n t ] as a function of . for small , the mc results for p v /[n t ] reproduce very
well the analytical formula (8). p v /[n t ] monotonically decreases with  as forecasted by the dilute expansion (8).
for  = t  1.51 (point t in g.2), close to c  1.54 (point c in g.2) a phase transition suddenly happens in the
ce and p v /[n t ] becomes large and negative. the interparticle distance < r > monotonically decreases with  too.
when  crosses t , < r > has a sharp decrease.

the mce and ce monte carlo results are very close (up to the statistical error) for 0 <  < c , that is for
 >  > c  0.19. in the mce the gas does not clump at  = c (point c in g.2) and the specic heat becomes
negative between the points c and m c. the gas does clump in the mce at   0.32 ,   1.35 (point m c in g.2)
increasing both its temperature and pressure discontinuously. as is clear, the domain between c and m c cannot be
reached in the ce since cv > 0 in the ce.

we now recast the coordinate partition function en () as a functional integral in the thermodynamic limit.

where we used the coordinates ~x in the unit volume. the rst term is the potential energy, the second term is the
functional integration measure for this case (see [3]). eq.(9) is dominated for large n by its stationary point solutions:

(x) is independent of r and  is related to r by  () = r.

where dc(r) stands for the determinant of small uctuations around the spherically symmetric saddle point (11)
and c(r) for the two-loop corrections. dc(r) can be expressed as an innite product over the partial waves

dc (r) =ql0[dl(r)]2l+1. d0(r) and d1(r) can be computed in closed form [4]

d0(r) [see g.1] is positive for 0  r  r

we thus get for the free energy in the ce from eqs.(5), (9), (10) and (14)

r(3f  1)f (r) + (3f  3 + r)f = 0 .

(15)

(16)

which reduces to an abel equation of rst kind[6].

by expanding the solution of eq.(12) in powers of  one checks that eq.(15) reproduces eq.(8)[4]. we plot in g.1
fmf (r) as a function of r obtained by solving eqs.(12-15) by the runge-kutta method. we nd that mc results
(both in the mce and ce) and the mf results are in excellent agreement. (this happens although the geometry for
the mc calculation is cubic while it is spherical for the mf).

the clumping phase transition takes place when dc(r) vanishes at r = r

breaks down since the correction terms become large in eqs.(14-15). mf applies when n |r

particle distribution.

in the dilute regime r  1 the gas density is uniform, as expected. we nd that these mass distributions approxi-
mately follow the power law

m(r)  c rd

(19)

where d slowly decreases with (r) as depicted in table 2 from the value d = 3 for the ideal gas (r = 0) till
d = 0.98 in the extreme limit of the mc point.

the gravitational potential at the point ~r in the mf follows from eq.(10) to be

u (~r) = 

t
m

[(~x)  a] .

the local pressure in the gas takes then the form p(~r) = t (~r). we have thus derived the equation of state for the
self-gravitating gas. it turns to be locally the ideal gas equation. but, the self-gravitating gas is inhomogeneous,
the pressure at the surface of a given volume is not equal to the temperature times the average density of particles in
the volume. in particular, for the whole volume: p v /[n t ] = f (r) 6= 1 (except for  = 0).
