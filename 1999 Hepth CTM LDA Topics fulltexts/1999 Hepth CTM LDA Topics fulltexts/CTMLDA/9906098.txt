(2.19) clear, therefore, time coordinate ceases time function inside time machine, since metric gij becomes timelike there. over-rotating case use time coordinate outside horizon shall nd future directed timelike curve, indeed geodesic, move backwards time coordinate. sagnac connection bmpv metric aidxi = 2r2 3, (2.20) perfectly well dened timelike hypersurface bounds time machine. one computes sagnac curvature one nds anti-self dual respect four-dimensional conformally metric ij. becomes clearer one introduces isotropic coordinates x, |x| =pr2 . h harmonic function four-dimensional euclidean space e4 given (2.21) h = 1 + x2 , bmpv metric may written ds2 = h2(dt + aidxi)2 + hdx2, 3 jijh, ai = 2 8 (2.22) (2.23) 3 ij constant self-dual form e4. sagnac curvature given fij = 2 x4 3 ij, (2.24) 3 ij anti-self-dual tensor. isotropic coordinates cover exterior region rotating case. one obtains solution representing k black holes taking harmonic function h k poles {$9610046$}. 2.5 axi-symmetric stationary time machines order facilitate comparisons well known familiar spacetimes closed timelike curves prove useful develop general formalism valid stationary spacetimes admit, addition, circle action. killing eld generating circle action called m. well dened demanding integral curves closed circles. circle group given coordinate , range 0 2. will, addition, assume metric invariant simultaneous reversal k m. words, action r s1 orthogonally transitive. case bmpv black hole, = = l3. conventional angle, symmetry corresponds p symmetry. however formalism works perfectly well parameterises internal higher dimensional angle `a la kaluza-klein. one assuming ct symmetry. interpretation, angular momentum corresponds electric charge angular velocity corresponds electrostatic potential. assumptions, metric may written ds2 = v dt2 + 2w dtd + xd2 + gabdxadxb, (2.25) = 1, . . . , n 2 coordinates orbit space n = m/(r s1), functions v, x, w depend xa. ergospheres given v = 0 velocity light surface given x = 0. metric plane determinant 2, 2 = v x + w 2.
