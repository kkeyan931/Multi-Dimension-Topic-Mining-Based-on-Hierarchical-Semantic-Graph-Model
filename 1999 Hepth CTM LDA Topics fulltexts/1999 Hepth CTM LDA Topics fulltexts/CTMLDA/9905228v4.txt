abstract

we examine the dynamics induced on the four dimensional boundary of a ve
dimensional anti-desitter spacetime by the ve dimensional chern-simons theory
with gauge group the direct product of so(4, 2) with u (1). we show that, given
boundary conditions compatible with the geometry of 5d ads spacetime in the
asymptotic region, the induced surface theory is the w zw4 model.

it may be possible to understand the physics of elds which propogate
through space in terms of physics on the boundary of space [1]. for example,
even though 3d einstein gravity has no local dynamics, black holes possess
thermodynamic properties. the resolution of this seeming paradox is that
the dynamical processes responsible reside on the boundary of 3d spacetime.
this idea was broached by carlip [2] with the boundary dynamics occurring
on the event horizon. later strominger [3], motivated by earlier work of
brown and henneaux [4] and by string theory, showed that states on the
boundary at innity could also account for 3d black hole thermodynamics.
this has been generalized in a variety of ways to dierent species of black
holes in higher dimensions [5, 6, 7, 8].

what is a common element of all implementations of this program to date
is the construction of integrable eld theories on some boundary of space-
time. for instance, in 3d, the boundary theory is a version of the 2d wzw
model [9]. characteristically for integrable eld theories, the wzw theories
contain an innite number of conserved charges, or equivalently, an innite
dimensional kac-moody algebra obeyed by the currents. the association of
this algebra with conformal symmetry leads to the characterization of this
phenomenon as an example of the ads/cft correspondence [10].

the starting point for the construction of the boundary theories is usually
einstein gravity or some generalization thereof. however, the initial work in
3d used the close correspondence of einstein gravity in that dimensionality
with chern-simons theory. the reason for this is the fact that in the latter it
is comparatively straightforward to distangle gauge from dynamical degrees
of freedom.

an important question to ask at this point is if this situation is a conse-
quence of einstein gravity in 2+1 dimensions, or is it more generic? banados
et. al[11] have analyzed higher dimensional chern-simons theories on mani-
folds with boundary and found evidence that the situation might be generic.
in particular, they showed that the algebras (in diverse spacetime dimen-
sions) of charges on the boundary are generalizations of the kac-moody al-
gebra that they call w zw4 algebras. the latter are known in the mathemat-
ical literature as toroidal lie algebras [12]. they generalize the kac-moody
algebra in the sense that while the kac-moody algebra is the loop algebra
with a central charge, the n-toroidal lie algebras replace the loop with an
n-torus.

the w zw4 theory (sometimes known as the nair-schi or kahler chern-
simons theory) is a four dimensional non-linear eld theory which is a natural

1

generalization of the 2d wzw model. some of its properties have been
developed in the papers of nair, nair and schi, and losev et. al.
[13].
for example it is classically and perhaps quantum mechanically integrable
and one-loop renormalizable.
it was shown by inami et. al.[14] that the
associated current algebra is the 2-toroidal lie algebra. the same authors
have also formulated a 2n-dimensional generalization of the w zw4 theory
[15].

banados et. al.[11] do not explicitly derive the w zw4 boundary theory
from 5d chern-simons. they construct the algebra of gauge charges on the
boundary under the assumption that the gauge group is the direct product
of some non-abelian group g and the abelian group u(1). the purpose
of this letter is to ll in this last important step: we will show that with
boundary conditions compatible with the geometry of 5d ads spacetime in
the asymptotic region, the induced surface theory is precisely the w zw4
model.

we consider the chern-simons theory on a ve dimensional manifold with
boundary. it turns out that the best starting point is the six dimensional
functional cubic in the curvature [11]:

s6[ a] = zm 6df ( a)  f ( a)  f ( a)e .

(1)

in the above the integral is over a 6-manifold m 6, the inner product <> is an
invariant trilinear form in the algebra of some group g and which satises
the cyclic property < abc >=< cab >. finally, a is the connection
1-form over m 6 with respect to the group g, with f ( a) := d a + a  a =
d a + 1
2[ a, a] the corresponding curvature. the integral s6 is a topological
invariant associated with the principal bundle with group g over m 6. in the
following we assume that the wedge product  of forms is understood and
will not be explicitely written. one can show, see e.g. [11], that the 6-form in
the integrand above is locally exact: it is the exterior derivative of a 5-form
scs called the chern-simons form. the 2n + 1 dimensional generalization
of this form was added as a topological mass term to the usual yang-mills
lagrangian and analyzed by mickelsson[16].

in this letter, we restrict to the case where the gauge group g = so(4, 2)
u(1). in this we are following the lead of banados et. al. [11].1 the reason
1interestingly, the group g = su (2)  u (1) was considered in the mid-1980s by

mickelsson[17] in the context of topologically massive yang-mills theory.

2

for this is that supergravity in a ve dimensional spacetime with a nega-
tive cosmological constant leads us to the super anti-desitter group, whose
bosonic sector is precicely so(4, 2)  u(1). moreover we consider the invari-
ant trilinear form to be given by:

hjajbjci = t r(jajbjc);

hjajbj1i = hjbjaj1i = t r(jajb);
hjaj1j1i = hj1j1j1i = 0.

(2)

in the above, the ja are the generators of so(4, 2), while j1 is the generator
of u(1). the connection 1-form decomposes as a = a + a = aaja + a1j1.

consider the following functional of a, a on a 5-manifold m 5:

scs[a, a] = scs[a] + 3zm 5
t r(cid:26)a(da)2 +
scs[a] := zm 5

t r(ada +

a3),

3
5

a5 +

3
2

a3da(cid:27) .

(3)

(4)

where

with  = da the u(1) eld strength. it is straightforward to show that the
exterior derivative of the integrand in eq.(3) is < (f ( a))3 >, and hence that
scs[a, a] is the chern-simons form for so(4, 2)  u(1) for the postulated
trilinear form.

variation of the action eq.(3) yields:

scs[a, a] = 3zm 5

t r(f 2a) + 6z t r(f a) + 3z t r(f 2)a + sb, (5)

where f = da + a2 and the last term is a boundary variation:

sb = im 5(cid:20)t r(ada + daa +

3

a3 + 3a)a + 3(ada +

a3)a(cid:21) .

(6)
if m 5 has a non-trivial boundary m 4 := m 5, then we refer to elds dened
on m 5 as bulk modes, and those on m 4 as boundary modes. the eld
equations for the bulk modes of the theory are:

t r {(f  f + 2f  ) ja} = 0,
t r(f  f ) = gabf a  f b = 0.

(7)
(8)

unlike the three dimensional case, the above action describes a theory that
does have dynamical degrees of freedom [11]. however there is a generic

3

sector of the phase space wherein there are no dynamical degrees of freedom
in the bulk of the manifold, although there are propagating modes on the
boundary [11]. this sector is described by solutions of the form f = 0
and det() 6= 0 but otherwise arbitrary. such solutions are generic in the
sense of [11]. note that the presence of the boundary variation sb makes the
variational principle of the action scs[a, a] ill dened as given. it is therefore
necessary to add a compensating surface term to the action whose variation
precisely cancels sb. this compensating surface term is determined by the
choice of boundary conditions and plays a crucial role in determining the
boundary dynamics.

before deriving the boundary action, we outline the proof that the dy-
namics of the physical modes in the generic sector of the theory does indeed
take place on m 4. what is required is to derive the symplectic form on
the hamiltonian constraint surface and show that it is a total divergence.
following the procedure in [11, 19], one rst does a standard hamiltonian
decomposition of the elds into spatial and time components. in the hamil-
tonian context, the generic sector consists of gauge elds such that the spatial
components of the non-abelian eld strength are zero and the spatial part
of the abelian one form is non-degerate(i.e.
invertible). the equations of
motion then guarantee that the spacetime components of the eld strength
obey the generic conditions as well. the symplectic form is found by the
varying the kinetic term in the action under arbitrary variations of the gauge
potential in the generic sector of the constraint surface. since the spatial part
a of the connection is at, we can write a = h1 dh where h is an element
of so(4, 2). in terms of h we nd:

scs = z dtz

t rhd(h1 h)d(h1h)i .
t rh d(h1 h)(h1h)i ,

= z dti

(9)

where d denotes the covariant derivative along the boundary  of the
spatial slice . the last line in the above was obtained by integrating by
parts and using the fact that dd  f = 0. eq.(9) denes the sympletic
form and shows that the physical modes live on the boundary of , in
complete analogy with 3-d chern-simons gravity[19]. in terms of the lie
algebra valued charges:

q := j0 =

(12)

where the f a
bc are of the so(4, 2) structure constants. the algebra eq.(12)
is the 2-toroidal lie algebra, that is, the current algebra for the w zw4 the-
ory [14]. it is a non-trivial central extension of the lie algebra of so(4,2). it
generalizes the ane kac-moody algebra in that the latter is the centrally
extended loop algebra with one central charge; while the 2-toroidal algebra
is the centrally extended algebra of maps from a 2-torus to the (nite di-
mensional) lie algebra in question. the current algebra eq.(12) agrees with
the one found by mickelsson in the mid-1980s in his analysis of topologically
massive yang-mills theories in 2n + 1 dimensions [16, 17].

we will now determine the surface term whose variation cancels the un-
wanted boundary term sb in eq.(6) for boundary conditions consistent with
an asymptotic region of 5d ads spacetime. in the case of 3d chern-simons
theory, this procedure results in the wzw model on the 2d boundary [9].
we start by constructing the ads5 geometry following witten [20]. consider
the quadratic form:

f (u, v, xi) := uv  ijxixj,

(13)

where u, v, xi with i, j, ... = 1, 2, 3, 4 are coordinates in ir6 with the ultrarel-
ativistic metric

ds2

6 = dudv + ijdxidxj,

(14)

with ij the minkowski metric with signature (, +, +, +). now consider the
quadric given by the solution of f (u, v, xi) = 1, with points with an overall
sign change identied. in a coordinate patch with v > 0, we can solve for
u = (1 + ijxixj)/v and the metric eq.(14) reduces, after completing the
square, to the ads5 metric

v2 dv2 + ij(dxi

(15)

from the above, we see that in a region of large xed v, the leading order
terms in the frame and spin-connection elds are simply ev = 0, ei = dxi,
wi
v = ei. the corresponding so(4,2) gauge potential dened in
terms of the geometrical elds is therefore at:

the rst condition we impose on the boundary is that the connection a
is at. in this case we can simplify the boundary variation by replacing ada
by a3. moreover, we have veried that t r(a3a) = 0 for all lie algebra
valued a and a. the boundary variation reduces to:

sb = 3zm 4

t r(cid:18)aa + (ada +

2
3

a3)a(cid:19) .

(17)

we also assume that  is a xed two-form on the boundary so that the
variation a of the u(1) gauge potential must be of the form a = d, for
some scalar . integrating by parts and using the fact that f (a) = 0 we nd
that the second term in eq.(17) vanishes.

now we have assumed that m 5 admits a closed invertible 2-form  and
hence the restriction of  to the boundary m 4 is closed. from the at
so(4, 2) connection, one may construct a at frame-eld compatible with
a (lorentzian) spin-connection, which upon wick rotation, provides a eu-
clidean structure. the at euclidean geometry enables the construction of a
complex structure on m 4 [21]. hence, using this complex structure, we can
write:

sb = 3zm 4

t r(aiaj  ajai)ijdzi  dzj  dzi  dzj

.

(18)

in the above the zi, i, j, ... = 1, 2 are complex coordinates on m 4. the above
expression cannot be integrated for arbitrary connection a on the bound-
ary. one way to proceed is to assume further boundary conditions on the
connection.
if we assume, analogously to carlip for the 2+1 dimensional
case [22], that ai is xed on the boundary, then the second term in eq.(18)
vanishes identically and the rst term can be trivially integrated. with these
boundary conditions, the complete action, including required boundary term
is:

s = scs[a] + 3zm 5

t r(ada +

2
3

a3) + 3im 4

t r(aidzi  aidzi)   . (19)

6

recalling that on shell f [a] = 0, we can parametrize the gauge potential as
a = h1dh. what we are left with is the gauge dependent part of the action,
namely:

s[h] = zm 5

t r(h1dh)3 + 3zm 4

t r[(h1h)(h1 h)],

(20)

this is precisely the w zw4 action[23, 14]. 2

to summarize, we have examined the 5d chern-simons theory with gauge
group so(4, 2)  u(1) on a manifold with boundary. we have looked at
the sector of phase space wherein the so(4, 2) connection is at and the
u(1) connection is xed but not at. these conditions are obeyed by a
connection constructed from the frame-elds and spin-connection of anti-
desitter spacetime. we have shown that the procedure rst applied by carlip
to 2+1 chern-simons theory can also be applied in the present case. the
result is that non-trivial eld theory induced on the boundary, namely the
w zw4 theory, whose action is given in eq.(20). this theory has the 2-
toroidal lie algebra (eq.(12)) as the algebra of observables.

it seems likely that our analysis can be extended in a straightforward
manner to the chern-simons action generalized to 2n + 1 dimensions. the
algebra of boundary charges in the generalized case (the wzw2n algebra)
has already been constructed by banados et al[11]. (see also mickelsson[16,
17]). we are currently in the process of checking whether the boundary
theory in this case is the corresponding wzw2n model of [15].

finally, we would like to mention that there exists a somewhat dier-
ent and more natural way to arrive at the complete action, with boundary
terms, in eq.(19).3
in particular, it is not necessary to impose the strong
boundary condition that ai be xed on the boundary. instead, one notes
that the variation of eq.(19) yields the equations of motion for the bulk with
no boundary terms if and only if the connection on the boundary is at and
expressable locally as a = h1dh where the h obeys the wzw4 eld equa-
tions. in this view, one can think of the full action as containing both the
5-d chern simons theory for the bulk modes, and the wzw4 theory for
gauge modes on the boundary. it is important to note in this context that
the gauge modes on the boundary are completely decoupled from the bulk

2the term (1/10)rm 5 t r(h1dh)5 from sc s in eq.(4) is the winding number of maps

from m 5 to 5-spheres in the group manifold so(4,2). this can be easily shown to be
identically zero for the group so(4, 2) in ve dimensions.

3we are grateful to s. carlip for pointing this out to us.
