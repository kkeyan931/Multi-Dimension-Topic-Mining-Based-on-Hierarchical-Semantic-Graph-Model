we consider travelling waves propagating on the anti-de sitter (ads) background. it is pointed
out that for any dimension d, this space of solutions has a virasoro symmetry with a non-zero
central charge. this result is a natural generalization to higher dimensions of the three-dimensional
brown-henneaux symmetry.

we consider in this note travelling waves in d = 3 + n
dimensions propagating on ads spacetime described by
the line element,

ds2 =

l2
z 2 [dz 2 + h(z, xi, u)du2 + dudv + dxidxi].

(1)

here i = 1, 2, ..., n and all coordinates are dimensionless.
this metric satises einsteins equations with a cosmo-
logical constant proportional to 1/l2, provided h sat-
ises the siklos [13] equation,

the explicit form of the metric). this yields two copies of
the virasoro algebra with the same central charge, and
hence, the conformal group. this result has provided an
elegant statistical description of (non-extreme) black hole
entropy in three dimensions [12].

the goal of this note is to point out that the results of
[11] can be extended in a natural way to higher dimen-
sions. indeed, we shall prove that the class of metrics (1)
has a virasoro symmetry with a central charge

the solution (1) can also be obtained,
for example,
following the general technique developed in [4] using
anti-de sitter space as background geometry. the per-
turbation h du2/z 2 is of the general kerr-shild type
(x) dxdx where  is a null, hypersurface orthog-
onal, killing eld. the dependence of h in the coordi-
nate u is arbitrary and denes the prole of the travelling
wave.

solutions of the form (1), and their generalizations in-
cluding other gauge elds, have been extensively studied
in the string theory literature [58]. recently, (1) has ap-
peared in [9] as an exact non-linear version of the randall
and sundrum model [10].

in the particular case with d = 3 and no transverse
dimensions (n = 0), the metric (1) enjoys a conformal
symmetry which follows from the analysis of [11]. there
exists a transformation of coordinates (non vanishing at
innity) whose associated noether charges obeys the vi-
rasoro algebra with a central charge c = 3l/2g3. actu-
ally, in three dimensions, the solution (1) can be gener-
alised to include an arbitrary function of v (see [13] for

where gd is the d-dimensional newton constant.

the existence of an innite dimensional symmetry
u  f (u) is signaled by the arbitrarness of h as a func-
tion of u. this, together with the ads structure, yields
the virasoro algebra.
in fact, the line element (1) is
form-invariant under the following redenition of the co-
ordinates,

the transformation (4) is not a killing symmetry of (1)
because it changes the metric. however it does take solu-
tions to solutions. in other words it acts on the innite-
dimensional simplectic manifold consisting of classical so-
lutions of einsteins equations of the form (1). when a
group acts on a simplectic manifold preserving the sym-
plectic form the associated poisson algebra will in general
be a central extension of the lie algebra of the original
group. in our case the group is that of one-dimensional
dieomorphisms and the central extension that of vira-
soro.

to make contact with previous work we note that the
transformation only changes the value of h leaving the
leading part of the metric invariant, it denes an asymp-
totic symmetry. generically speaking, a transformation
of coordinates is trivial if it goes to the identity su-
ciently fast at innity. in our choice of coordinates, in-
nity is located in the open region1 z  0 and since the
map u  f (u) does not depend on z, the transformation
(4) does not go to the identity there. in fact, the trans-
formation (4) is an asymptotic symmetry of the space
of solutions (1) with a corresponding non-zero noether
charge.

by a straightforward application of the results pre-
sented in [15,11] and references therein, the noether
charge associated to (4) is2,

the relevant properties of the transformation (4) are
encoded in the noether charge j.
if j is nite, then
the transformation (4) represent a physical not gauge
change of the state. this is analogous to a boost in an
asymptotically at space which induces momentum. fur-
thermore, the knowledge of the charge j and its transfor-
mation properties will enable us to determine the algebra
of the generators of (4) in a straightforward way.

the function t appearing in (7) transforms as a vira-
soro operator. indeed, from (5) and (8) it is straightfor-
ward to prove (applying the operator 1
z z
at both sides of (5)) that t transforms as,

z z = (f ) 1

t (z, x, u) = t (z, x, u)(f )2 

c
12{f, u},

(9)

where the central charge is given in (3).

let us now analyse the value of the noether charge j
on the space of solutions of the equation (2). the general
solution to (2) can be written down and involves bessel
functions. actually, the function t , related to h in (8),
satises a bessel equation as well. since in our discussion
h is not relevant (the charge and virasoro transforma-
tion only depend on t 3) we write the general solution
directly in terms of t ,

t (u, z, xi) = z dnk zn/2[a(ki, u)jn/2(kz)
+ b(ki, u)yn/2(kz)]eikixi

(10)
where k = kiki, jn/2 and yn/2 are bessel functions,
and a and b are arbitrary functions of their arguments.
inserting (10) into (7) we nd the formula for the

the sector (a 6= 0, b = 0) has a nite noether charge
in the limit z  0. note, however, that the central term
in (9) does not depend on z. since the solution with
a 6= 0 has a prefactor zn/2jn/2(kz)  zn we conclude

1note, however, that (1) is not globally asymptotically ads.
2we use the coordinate v as time, and we assume that u
is compact with period 2, as in dlcgq. see, for example,
[14]. this yields a meaningful adm decomposition provided
h 6= 0.

frame, which control the existence of singularities [9], depend
only on t as well.

that the central piece in (9) is not carried by this sector.
since we are interested in the centrally extended virasoro
algebra we set, from now on, a = 0.

next, we note that the central piece in (9) does not de-
pend on xi either. this means that only the zero mode
of b(ki, u) will see it. setting b(ki, u) = b(u) we nd
the formula for the charge

jb() = vz du

(u)b(u),

(12)

where the prefactor v := r dnx/zn is the proper volume

of transverse space (recall that zn is the factor in the
ads volume element). furthermore, from (9) we derive
the transformation law of b(u),

b(u) = b(u)(f )2 

c
12{f, u}.

(13)

as usual when working with extended objects, the
charge jb diverges because v  . we then dene
the density of charge per unit of proper volume,

jb() =

= z du

(u)b(u),

(14)

which is indeed nite.

the formula (13) is not enough to claim that b car-
ries a central charge c because it depends on the nor-
malization of b.
in order to x the value of the cen-
tral charge we need to prove that b satises the vira-
soro algebra. this can be done using a general theorem
proved in [15,11,16]. let (m, g) be a riemannan space-
time with a group of asymptotic killing vectors elds 
i
i h + j[i] the corre-
sponding canonical generators. by denition, j[i] is a
boundary term that makes h dierentiable and is equal
to the noether charge associated to the symmetry i [15].
then, it follows,

(i = 1, ..., n ), and let h[i] = r 

i j(j) = [j(i), j(j)].

(15)

this formula yields a powerful way to compute the al-
gebra of global charges in gauge theories. we remark
that the number of asymptotic symmetries need not to
be nite. indeed, in our case, as in [11], the asymptotic
symmetries are parametrised by the innite number of
fourier modes of f (u). another example on which this
procedure yields an innite dimensional algebra is the
ane kac-moody algebra in non-abelian chern-simons
theory [17].

we now apply this result to our situation. first, we no-
tice that since we are working with a density of charge,
the right hand side of (15) should be understood as a
density of poisson bracket, i.e., as the poisson bracket
divided by the proper volume v. the function b(u)
transforms as in (13). we then nd,

which is indeed the virasoro algebra with a central charge
c.

the virasoro symmetries described here arise generi-
cally for all solutions describing travelling waves on ads
backgrounds, or whose near horizon geometries are of
the form adsn  ndn. these include many exam-
ples relevant for the ads/cft correspondence as, for
example, d3 branes and the m2/m5 solution. con-
sider, in particular, the d1/d5 system consisting of a
ten dimensional string theory compactied on s1  t4
with a non-zero rr eld h3 carrying both electric and
magnetic charges q1 and q5. this system can be de-
scribed by a two dimensional conformal eld theory with
a central charge c = 6q1q5 [18]. on the other hand,
the near horizon geometry has the well-known structure
ads3  s3  t 4 and we should then expect a realisa-
tion of the brown-henneaux conformal symmetry [11].
it was noticed in [12] that the eective three-dimensional
newton constant g3 and cosmological constant l satisfy
c = 3l/2g3 = 6q1q5. thus, the brown-henneaux vira-
soro generators are indeed those of the cft.

travelling waves propagating on this background have
it was already noticed in that
been studied in [8].
reference that there exists a transformation of coordi-
nates mapping the longitudinal travelling wave into the
background geometry. this transformation is a partic-
ular case of the general virasoro symmetry discussed
here and corresponds to solving the dierential equation
t (u) = t (u)(f )2  c
12{f, u} = 0. note that a func-
tion f (u) mapping t 6= 0 into t  = 0 can exist because
of the inhomogenous term in the transformation law of
t . let us now check that the central charge, appearing
in the classical poisson bracket of the noether charges,
is the correct one.

gitudinal travelling wave is (see [8] and references therein)

transformations (4) adapted to these coordinates. the
resulting noether charge is
