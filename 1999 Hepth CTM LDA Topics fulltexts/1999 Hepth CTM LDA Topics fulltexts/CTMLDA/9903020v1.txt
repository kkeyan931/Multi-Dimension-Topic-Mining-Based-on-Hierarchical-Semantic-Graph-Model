we review the basic structure of the higher spin extension of d = 4, n = 8 ads
supergravity. the theory is obtained by gauging the higher spin superalgebra
shse(8|4) by a procedure pioneered by vasiliev. the algebra shse(8|4) is a sub-
algebra of the enveloping algebra of osp(8|4). the physical states of the theory
are in one to one correspondence with the symmetric product of two osp(8|4)
singletons. this singleton theory, which may be viewed in a certain limit as the
supermembrane theory on ads4  s7, is expected to describe the dynamics of
the higher spin theory. thus, the higher spin n = 8 supergravity on ads4 is
conjectured to describe the eld theory limit of m -theory on ads4  s7.

1 introduction

a consistent interacting eld theory of elds with spin higher than two has
long interested the high energy physicists. many attempts to construct such
theories encountered severe diculties in the past and led to no-go theorems.
however, no-go theorems are usually based on a number of assumptions and
such theorems may as well disappear when some of those assumptions are
relaxed. indeed, this is just what happened in the search for higher spin eld
theories as well. firstly, and perhaps not surprisingly, the number of higher
spin elds participating in the full theory need to be innite, as opposed to
one higher spin eld at a time considered previously, and secondly, and that
is the surprising part, the spacetime in which the theory is formulated must
admit ads space as a solution 1,2 rather than minkowskian space assumed in
previous attempts.
the occurrence of innitely many elds is very suggestive of an underlying
extended object theory. string theory in ads4 has been considered briey in
[3] but the results appear to be inconclusive. in a separate line of development,
the eleven dimensional supermembrane theory appeared in 1987 4. soon after,
it was suggested 5 that the ads4 supersingleton may play a role in its descrip-
tion. this is the ultra short representation of the ads4 supergroup osp(4|8),
consisting of 8 bosonic and 8 fermionic states 6,7 which cannot be described in
terms of local elds in the bulk of ads4. soon after that, a connection between
the osp(8|4) supersingleton eld theory, assumed to arise from the ads4  s7
compactication of the supermembrane, and a higher spin supergravity the-
ory in ads4 bulk was conjectured in [8, 9, 10]. this conjecture was especially
aided by the remarkable property of the singletons, namely the fact that the
symmetric product of two supersingletons yields an innite tower of massless
higher spin states 11. the form of this result for osp(8|4) was spelled out in
[10], and it was argued that all of these states should arise in the quantum
supermembrane theory 8,9,10.
these developments provided further motivation for the analysis of the su-
permembrane on various manifolds of the form ads4  m7, where m7 is a
positive curvature einstein manifold, and various issues arising in the expan-
sion of the supermembrane action around these vacua 12,13,14. these were the
early developments on the subject of bulk ads and boundary cft connection
in the context of the d = 11 supermembrane its simplest form. the ads/cft
connection has acquired a deeper and wider signicance in the light the de-
velopments of the last year which were triggered by the work of maldacena
15.
turning to the story of higher spin elds, interestingly enough, at the same

2

period when as the supermembrane/singletons/higher-spin-elds connections
were being considered, fradkin and vasiliev 1,2 were in the course of develop-
ing a higher spin gauge theory in its own right (see [1] for references to earlier
work). these authors succeeded in constructing interacting eld theories for
higher spin elds. as mentioned above, the previous diculties in constructing
higher spin theories were bypassed by formulating the theory in ads4 and by
considering an innite tower of gauge elds controlled by various higher spin
algebras based on certain innite dimensional extensions of ads4 superalge-
bras. an intriguing property of the higher spin eld theories, which again is
very suggestive of an underlying extended object, is the fact that the interac-
tions are non-local. in particular, the ads4 radius can not be taken to innity
since its positive powers occur in the higher spin interactions and therefore one
can not take a naive poincare limit.
in a series of papers vasiliev 1720 pursued the program of constructing the
ads higher spin gauge theory and simplied the construction considerably. in
[18] the spin 0 and 1/2 elds were introduced to the system at the level of the
equations of motion within the framework of free dierential algebras. the
equations of motion were furthermore cast into an elegant geometrical form in
[19, 20] by extending the higher spin algebra to include new auxiliary spinorial
variables. for n = 1, r  r type actions have been considered 1,2, but one
drawback of these actions is that the spin s  1 sector of the theory does not
t in a natural and geometrical way into the part of the action that describes
the elds with spin s  3/2.
interestingly enough, applying the formalism of vasiliev to a suitable higher
spin algebra that contains the maximally extended super ads algebra osp(8|4),
the resulting spectrum of gauge elds and spin s  1
2 elds coincide with the
massless states resulting from the symmetric product of two osp(8|4 super-
singletons 9. in a recent paper 21, we examined the vasiliev theory of higher
spin elds (which is applicable to a wide class of higher spin superalgebras)
and determine the precise manner in which the n = 8 de wit-nicolai gauged
supergravity 22 which is the gauged version of the cremmer-julia n = 8 su-
pergravity in four dimensions 23 can be described within this framework. we
showed how this embedding works in the higher spin ads supergravity based
on the higher spin superalgebra known as shse(8|4)24,25.
the most natural next step in this program is to compare the interactions
in the higher study with those of gauged n = 8 supergravity, and to search
for the e7/su (8) structure 23 in the full theory. even more tantalizing is the
prospects of generating the full content of the higher spin theory from the
osp(8|4) singleton eld theory which lives in the boundary of ads4.
the purpose of this report is far more modest, namely to give a concise review

3

of the work presented in [21], and to emphasize the elegant geometrical picture
that underlies the higher spin eld equations. in sec. 2, we discuss the higher
spin algebra, its gauging and the constraints which encode the dynamics. in
sec. 3, we discuss the linearization of the higher spin equations around the
ads4 vacuum, the spectrum of physical states, their equations of motion and
the comparison with the linearized eld equations of the gauged n = 8, d = 4
supergravity. the uniqueness of the constraints is discussed in sec. 4. further
comments on the results and on open problems are collected in sec. 5.

2 the higher spin gauge theory

2.1 the higher spin algebra
the higher spin algebra shse(8|4) arises most naturally as a truncation of an
in the bosonic so(3, 2) majorana spinors y and z ( = 1, ..., 4) and the
real, fermionic so(8) vector i which obey the following associative but non-
commutative  product rule 20

extended higher algebra dshse(8|4) . the latter is the algebra of polynomials

p (z, y )  q(z, y ) = z d4u d4v p (z +u, y +u ) q(zv, y +v )eiu v ,

(1)
where the integral is normalized such that 1p = p . this formula in particular
implies

z  z 

y  z 

=

=

zz   ic  ,
yz   ic  ,

z  y  = zy  + ic  ,

y  y  = yy  + ic  ,

(2)

where c  is the anti-symmetric charge conjugation matrix. the product
rule eq. (1) is isomorphic to the normal ordered product of a set of harmonic
oscillators formed out of the spinor variables. the  product between s is
that of the so(8) cliord algebra, so that for example i  j = ij + ij.
we next dene the map

 p (z; y, )

:= p (iz; iy, i) ,

which acts as a graded anti-homomorphism of the  algebra:

 (p  q) = (1)p q (q)   (p ) .

4

(3)

(4)

the extended higher spin algebradshse(8|4) is by denition the space of grass-

mann even polynomials p (z; y, ) obeying 25

dshse(8|4)

:= (cid:8)p (z; y, )(cid:12)(cid:12)  p = p , p  = p(cid:9) ,

with lie bracket

[ p , q ]

:= p  q  q  p .

the higher spin algebra shse(8|4) is dened by 25

the osp(8|4) subalgebra generators are

shse(8|4)

:= dshse(8|4)|z=0 .
osp (8|4) = (cid:8) yy  , yi , ij (cid:9) .

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

the algebra shse(8|4) splits under osp(8|4) into levels labeled by  = 0, 1, ...
and the th level generators are given by a homogeneous polynomials of de-
gree 4 + 2. the 0th level is osp(8|4). actually, shse(8|4) is the space of
odd polynomials in osp(8|4) generators which are fully symmetric in so(3, 2)
spinor indices and fully anti-symmetric in so(8) vector indices.

2.2 gauging dshse(8|4)
the gauging ofdshse(8|4) proceeds by introducing a master gauge eld  which
is andshse(8|4) valued 1-form on the space m which is the product of spacetime

with the non-commutative z space with coordinate zm = (x, z ), where x
are the spacetime coordinates. introducing the total exterior derivative

d := dzm m = dx + dz  ,

(9)

we dene the dshse(8|4) valued connection 1-form b



=

dzm m (x, z; y, ) ,

 

=

 ,

 =  .

(10)

the dshse(8|4) valued curvature 2-form r is

b  is related to the eld s introduced by vasiliev in [19] by s = z + 2i.

5

which obeys the bianchi identity

r = d     ,

d r := d r  [  , r ] = 0 .

(11)

(12)

  = d ,

 r = [  , r ] ,

the dshse(8|4) gauge transformations are
where  is andshse(8|4) valued parameter.
the gauging of dshse(8|4) diers from ordinary yang-mills theory in two sig-
nicant ways. firstly, r is a non-local z  function of  due to the  operation
imposing constraints on r, this non-locality
in the quadratic term   .
in z-space manifests itself as non-locality in spacetime in the form of higher
derivative dependence on the elds. secondly, viewing the connection  as a
map from m to the internal space coordinatized by (y, ), the values assumed
by  at a given point in m depend on the z-coordinates of the point.
we dene the shse(8|4) valued gauge eld  and its curvature r by

(13)



:=

r :=

i  = dx(x; y, ) ,
i r = 1

2 dx  dxr (x; y, ) ,

(14)

(15)

where i : shse(8|4)  dshse(8|4) is the embedding map. from the denition

eq. (5) of shse(8|4) it then follows that  has the expansion



=

xk=0  xm+n=4k (cid:0) 1
+ xm+n=4k+1(cid:0)i(m, n)i + 1

8! i1i8 (m, n)i1i8(cid:1)

(16)

3! ijk(m, n)ijk + 1

7! i1i7 (m, n)i1i7(cid:1)! ,

where we have used the notation

p (m, n) := 1

m!n! p1m 1 n y1  ym y 1  y n .

(17)

time, the dshse(8|4) valued curvature r must be constrained. there exists a

thus bosonic gauge elds are always in the 1, 28 and 35+ +35 representations
of so(8), while the fermionic elds are always in 8 and 56 representations.
to realize shse(8|4) invariant dynamics irreducibly on a set of elds in space-
set of constraints which achieves this while maintaining spacetime dieomor-
phism invariance. the solution of these constraints involve a 0-form master
eld  subject to certain conditions. the eld  essentially consists of the
non-vanishing components of the spacetime shse(8|4) curvatures and the spin
2 elds listed in table 1. the required properties of  turn out to be
s = 0, 1

  =   ,

 = ( )   ,

where

 = 12  8

(18)

(19)

is the so(8) chirality matrix, and  and  are homomorphisms of the  algebra
dened by

p (z, z; y, y; )

p (z, z; y, y; )

:=

:=

p (z, z;y, y; ) ,
p (z,z; y,y; ) .

(20)

in eq. (18) we have introduced an so(3, 1) covariant notation where y and
z are complex, two-component weyl spinors with hermitian conjugates y  :=
(y) and z  := (z) and y := (y, y ) and z := (z,z ). this amounts
to formulating the shse(8|4) invariant theory in an so(3, 1) basis.
at z = 0 we nd that the eld

(x; y, )

:= i 

(21)

has the expansion

 = xm>n0(cid:2)(m, n; ) + (1)n(m, n; )  (cid:3) +xm0

(m, m; ) ,

(22)

7

where we have used the notation eq. (17) and where the complex elds (m, n; )
have the -expansion

for m = n. hence the bosonic elds are in the 1, 28 and 35+ + 35 repre-
sentations of so(8) and the fermions are in the 8 and 56 representations. in
particular we recognize that the scalar elds ijkl(0, 0) are the 35+ +35 real
scalars of the the n = 8 supergravity multiplet 23 (see table 1), and that these
obey the su (8) invariant reality condition which is crucial for the consistency
of the e7/su (8) coset construction. we also nd that (0, 0) is the complex
scalar of the level 1 supermultiplet in table 1 and that (1, 0; ) contains the
fermions of level 0 and 1 in table 1. as we shall see in sec. 3, the remaining
spin s  1 components of  are auxiliary elds that are given by the derivatives
of the spin s  1
2 elds and certain non-vanishing spacetime curvatures that
are known as weyl tensors.

2.3 the master curvature constraint

a set of curvature constraints that realize the dynamics of the higher spin
gauge theory irreducibly are

r = 0 ,

r = 0 ,

r  = 0 ,

and the twisted reality condition

   r   =  r  k ,

8

(25)

(26)

where the operator k is dened by

(27)
the condition eq. (26) implies that r can be expressed in terms of the eld
 introduced in eq. (18) as

k :=  exp(iy z) .

where

r =  i

2     ,

 := exp(iyz) .

this operator is an inner kleinian operator19 with the basic property

  p (z, z; y, y; ) =  p (y, z; z, y; ) ,

from which it follows that

   = 1 ,

  p = (p )   .

the operator k =  and from eq. (31) it follows that

k  k = 1 ,

k  p =  2(p )  k .

(28)

(29)

(30)

(31)

(32)

we shall discuss the consequences of the twisted reality condition eq. (26)

shortly. first, we need to establish the integrability anddshse(8|4) covariance of

the constraints eq. (25) and eq. (28). to begin with we note these constraints
can be written concisely as

r = i

4 (dz  dz    + dz   dz    ) ,

(33)

inserting the constraint eq. (33) into the bianchi identity eq. (12) one nds
the following constraint on 

d  := d      +     = 0 .

(34)

since d2  = 0 there are no further conditions and the full set of constraints
given by eq. (33) and eq. (34) is integrable. the constraint eq. (33) is invariant

under the dshse(8|4) transformation eq. (13) provided that

  =        .

(35)

9

these gauge transformations close, that is

[1 , 2 ]  = [ 1 , 2 ]

 .

(36)

the gauge transformations eq. (13) and eq. (35) also preserve the constraint
eq. (34), since

 d  =   d   d     .

(37)

in summary, the full set of integrable constraints which dene the n = 8 higher
spin gauge theory based on shse(8|4) is:

d 
r 
r
r
r
d 

= 0 ,

= 0 ,

2     ,

=  i
= 0 ,

= 0 ,

= 0 ,

(38)

(39)

(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)

we will discuss uniqueness in sec. (5). while these equations fully capture
the higher spin theory based on shse(8|4), they contain many auxiliary elds.
their elimination and the derivation of the full equations of motion in terms
of a set of dynamical elds is a highly non-trivial matter which has not been
solved yet. the structure of the equations become clear, however, by linearizing
them around a vacuum solution. one then nds that eq. (38) determines the
z dependence of  in terms of the initial condition . then eqs. (39)-(40)
determine the z dependence of  in terms of  up to a pure gauge solution
d  which can be used to impose the gauge

|z=0 = 0 .

(44)

this amounts to that there are no spacetime degrees of freedom associated
with the initial conditions for . from eq. (41) one then solves for the z
dependence of  in terms of  and the initial condition . one is then left
with eqs. (42)-(43), which one can show are equivalent to

10

r := i r = 1
d

2 dx  dxr (x; y, ) = 0 ,

:= i d  = dxd(x; y, ) = 0 ,

(45)

where r is the curvature two-form dened in eq. (15). observe that eq. (45)
is the pull-back by i of the full set of constraints eq. (33) and eq. (34)
to spacetime.
if the z space had been an ordinary commuting space, then
this pull-back operation would have implied the vanishing of the spacetime
curvatures dened as

r

d

:= d     ,
:= d     +    .

(46)

the non-locality of the z space, however, implies that r and d depend on all
the coecients of the taylor expansions of  and  around z = 0, which in
turn are determined in terms of  and  as explained above. hence r and d
are innite expansions of the form r = r + ... and d = d + ... in powers of
the 0-form . therefore eq. (45) gives a set of non-trivial constraints on the
spacetime curvatures r and d.
the constraints eq. (45) are invariant under the residual, gauge transforma-
tions c of eq. (44), which are





ii  = d  i[  , i ] ,

=
:= ii  = i(i      i) ,

(47)

(48)

where (x; y, ) is an shse(8|4) valued parameter. from the closure of the 
transformations on  and , and using the property [ i1 , i2 ] = i[ 1 , 2 ],
it follows that the residual gauge transformations eqs. (47)-(48) close.
let us now return to the twisted reality condition eq. (26). to illustrate the
role of the operator k in eq. (26), let us suppose that we have a solution to
eqs. (38)-(43) such that (0) = 0. we can then set (0)
 = 0 by means of an
 , (x, z; y, ), so a residual gauge
c eq. (44) implies that   z , (x, z; y, ) + z
  +   )|z=0 = 0.
transformation parameter (x, z; y, ) obeys  |z=0 = ( + 2i
the shse(8|4) valued and therefore z-independent parameter  = i clearly obeys this
condition.

11

dshse(8|4) gauge transformation. then eq. (41) implies that  (0) = 0 which

is solved by (0)
 (y, ). next, we observe from eq. (38) that a small
uctuation eld (1) obeys  (1) = 0, which is solved by (1) = (y, ). then
eq. (43) reads

 = (0)

d  (0)   +   (0) = 0 .

(49)

since (0) is at one might expect that this equation only allows rigid solutions,
but a more careful analysis (see sec. (3.2) in the case when (0) is the ads
vacuum) shows that these equations do not constrain the chiral components
(m, 0; ). moreover, it follows from

(y, y; )  |z=0 = (y, 0; )

(50)

that only the chiral components of  contribute to the linearization of r.
eq. (45) thus expresses the linearized spacetime curvatures r(1) in terms of
the chiral components of  (see eqs. (56)-(58) in the case when (0) is the ads
vacuum)
the crucial role of the k-twisted reality condition eq. (26) can now be un-
derstood as follows. if we impose an ordinary reality condition without the

k-twist, namely if we impose the condition    r   =  r , then r =
 i
2   where  =  and the constraint eq. (49) now becomes

d  (0)   +   (0) = 0 ,

(51)

where  = i . this constraint does not allow any local dynamics. this can
be seen by observing that eq. (51) is identical in form to the higher spin killing
equation for rigid gauge transformations that preserve the connection (0) (the
only dierence between  and , which is insignicant in the present context,
is that they have opposite  -parity) d.
we conclude this section by noting that the constraints eq. (33) and eq. (34)
are invariant under the spacetime dieomorphisms which are incorporated into

thedshse(8|4) gauge group such that x =  is generated by the gauge trans-

formation with parameter () = i . the z space dieomorphisms, on the

d the atness of (0)(y, ) implies that (0) = g1  dg where g is an shse(8|4) group
element. eq. (51) is then solved formally by taking  = g1  p  g for an shse(8|4) valued
polynomial p with constant coecients. applying this formal method to eq. (49) gives
 = g1  p  g for a constant p . these results naively would imply that both eq. (49)
and eq. (51) have only rigid solutions, whereas a more careful analysis shows that there is
room for unconstrained chiral components in the solutions to eq. (49) while eq. (51) indeed
only allows the rigid solutions.

to the vanishing of (a)  r  where (a)  (a = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5) are the so(3, 2)

m

(m, n; ) of  : the  denotes the scalars, the two s denote the spin 1

figure 1: each entry of the integer grid, m, n = 0, 1, 2, ..., represents a component
2 elds; a 
denotes a chiral, auxiliary component (2s, 0, ) (s = 1, 3
2 , ...) which is equal to the
spin s weyl tensor given in eq. (56); the s denote auxiliary components which are
given in terms of derivatives of the chiral components according to eq. (65).

3.2 the spin s  1 linearized field equations
we begin by analyzing eq. (59) from which we nd that the non-chiral spin
s + l component (2s + l, l; ) (l = 1, 2, ...) is expressed in terms of its chiral
component (2s, 0; ) as follows

12s+l 1 l() = 1 12 2 l l12s () .

(65)

the chiral components of  are identied with the chiral curvature compo-
nents as in eq. (56). these chiral curvature components are the weyl tensors
and they are the only spacetime curvature components that are non-vanishing
on-shell, as follows from eqs. (56)-(57). inserting the expansions eq. (16) and
eqs. (23)-(24) into eq. (56) and eq. (65) one veries that the so(8) content
of both sides of these equations indeed match. thus, the spin s  1 compo-
nents of the master eld  are auxiliary in the sense that they can be solved
for algebraically in terms of the gauge elds and their derivatives. the spin

16

2 components, on the other hand, are independent since they cannot be

s  1
eliminated algebraically.
in obtaining eq. (65) one uses only the fully symmetrized components of
eq. (59). the remaining components are -traces. by combining eqs. (56)-
(57) with the bianchi identity eq. (61) for s  3
2 one can show by induction
that the -traces of eq. (59) for m + n  3 are identically satised provided
that its -traces for m + n  2 are satised. these constitute the linearized
equations of motion for the spin s  1 elds and the bianchi identity for the
spin 1 elds, which we summarize as follows:

a) the complex scalar (0, 0) and the 35+ + 35 scalars ijkl(0, 0) are dy-
namical elds which constitute ()  (0, 0; ) (see eq. (24)) which
obey the linearized eld equation (

  + 2)() = 0, that is

(2 + 2)() = 0 .

(66)

b) the complex weyl fermions ijk


are dynamical fermionic
elds which make up () which obey the linearized eld equation
 

() = 0, that is

and i1i7



(a) a() = 0 .

(67)

c) the spin 1 eld strength r(1)

amounts to

 () =  (), obeys  

r(1)

 () = 0, which

ar(1)

ab () = 0 ,

abcdbr(1)

cd () = 0 .

(68)

it follows that r(1)() = d(), and in the lorentz gauge aa() = 0
the resulting second order vector equation reads

(2 + 3) () = 0 .

(69)

hence, taking into account the rank of the dirac operator in eq. (67) and
the decoupling of the longitudinal mode in the spin 1 sector, one nds that
there are two real physical component functions for each spin and so(8) label.
these have mode function expansions with modes making up the massless
representations of the ads algebra, that is the representations d(e0 = s+1, s)
for s = 1
2 , 1 and d(1, 0) or d(2, 0) for s = 0. we use a notation where d(e0, s)

17

denotes a representation of so(3, 2) in which e0 labels the minimum energy
eigenvalue of the energy operator m05 and s is the maximum eigenvalue of the
spin operator m12 in the lowest energy sector.

3.3 auxiliary and dynamical gauge fields and symmetries

we next turn to solving the vanishing curvatures in eqs. (56)-(58) modulo the
relationships among them due to the bianchi identity eq. (61). the end result,
which is illustrated in fig. (2), is that the auxiliary gauge elds (m, n; ) for
|m  n|  2 are given in terms of the dynamical gauge elds (m, n; ) for
|m  n|  1 as follows:

the components (m1, n+1, ) (m > 0) are not determined by the constraint.
thus the auxiliary gauge elds (m, n; ) are given by |m  n|  a derivatives
of the dynamical gauge elds where a = 1 for bosonic elds and a = 2 for
fermionic elds.
we refer to the dynamical gauge elds (s  1, s  1; ) (s = 2, 3, ...) as the
2 , s  1
generalized vierbeins and the dynamical gauge elds (s  3
2 ; ) (s =
2 , 5
2 , ...) as the generalized gravitini. the auxiliary gauge elds (s, s  2; )
(s = 2, 3, ...) are referred to as the generalized lorentz connections.
the local gauge symmetries eq. (63) are divided into auxiliary gauge symme-
tries with parameters (m, n; ) for |m  n|  3 and dynamical gauge sym-
metries with parameters (m, n; ) for |m  n|  2. the dynamical gauge
symmetries in the bosonic spin s sector are the generalized reparametrizations
with parameters (s 1, s 1; ) and the generalized local lorentz transforma-
tions with parameters (s 2, s; ), and in the fermionic spin s sector they are
the generalized local supersymmetries with parameters (s  3
2 ; ) and
the fermionic, lorentz-like transformation with parameters (s  5
2 ; ).
from eq. (63) it follows that

2 , s  1

2 , s + 1

18

auxdyn = 0 ,

(71)

where aux is a parameter of an auxiliary gauge transformation and dyn :=

p|mn|1 (m, n; ). the auxiliary gauge transformation with parameter (m

1, n + 1; ) induces a shift in the undetermined component (m 1, n + 1, ) in
the auxiliary gauge eld (m, n; ) given by eq. (70). this stueckelberg type
gauge symmetry can be completely xed by imposing the gauge condition

(m, n; ) = 0 .

(72)

the denition eq. (71) also implies that the dynamical gauge symmetries
form a subalgebra of shse(8|4) which closes on the dynamical elds, since
if [1

dyn] = dyn + aux then from eq. (71)

dyn, 2

[1

]dyn = (cid:0)dyn + aux(cid:1) dyn = dyn dyn .

(73)

3.4 the spin s > 1 linearized field equations

the components of the curvature constraints eqs. (56)-(58) that are not used
up in solving for the auxiliary gauge elds are the eld equations for the spin
s > 1 dynamical gauge elds. they read

e(0)

m = n + 1

(74)

in the bosonic sector these are rst order equations for the generalized lorentz
connections, which by virtue of eq. (70) turn into second order eld equations
for the generalized vierbeins. in the fermionic sector eq. (74) are rst order
dirac like eld equations for the generalized gravitini.
by making use of the dynamical gauge symmetries one can x the generalized
lorentz type gauges

in the fermionic sector. these conditions eliminate all so(3, 1) irreducible
components in the generalized vierbeins and gravitini except the spin s compo-
nents 1 1,2s 2 s () and 1 1,2s1/2 2 s+1/2(), respectively, for
which one obtains the eld equations

any one of these representations are characterized by two real transverse
functions. to see this we rst note that in the bosonic sector the gauge
condition eq. (75) has residual gauge transformations given by generalized
reparametrizations obeying

() = 0 ,

 1s2  1 s2

[2 +1s2]1s1 1 s1

(79)
these gauge transformations obey the gauge xed equations of motion eq. (77)
and therefore decouple the longitudinal states from the physical spectrum.
hence the number of real transverse bosonic spin s functions is given by the
number of components of the spin s irrep ((s+1)2), minus the number of gauge
conditions in eq. (75) that are linear in derivatives (s2), minus the number of
residual gauge symmetries, which is equal to the number of degrees of freedom
in (s  1, s  1) (s2) minus the number of constraints in eq. (79) that are
linear in derivatives ((s  1)2), which indeed sum up to (s + 1)2  s2  [s2 
(s  1)2] = 2. similarly, in the fermionic sector one has residual generalized
local supersymmetries obeying

hence, taking into the account the fact that the dirac operator has half the
maximal rank, one nds that for any occurring so(8) representation there are
indeed (s + 1
2 )] = 2
real transverse fermionic spin s functions.
using rigid supersymmetries with parameter (0) = 1
2i iyi +h.c constructed
from the killing spinors in eq. (55) by setting i = rir
, we nd that
the physical spectrum obtained in eqs. (66)-(68) and eqs. (77)-(78) can be
arranged into the tower of supermultiplets given in table 1. the lowest level,
 = 0, is the cp t self-conjugate short supergravity multiplet, while the higher
levels each consists of two short irreducible multiplets that are transformed
into each other under cp t . let us discuss the structure of the level  = 0
multiplet in more detail.

3.5 embedding of the n = 8 gauged supergravity

from eqs. (66)-(68) and eq. (74) it follows that the linearized equations of

gauge elds; a  or a  denotes a generalized vierbein; a  denotes a generalized

gravitino; a  denotes a generalized lorentz connection and the s denote the re-
maining auxiliary gauge elds. the so(8) content is suppressed in this figure, but
it can be read o from table 1. the auxiliary gauge elds along the northwest-
southeast diagonal denoted s and s are given in terms of the dynamical gauge

elds in the middle of that diagonal denoted by s and the s. the arrows indicate

the action of supersymmetry on the members of the level  = 2 multiplet.

where i, j, .. = 1, ..., 8 are su (8) indices and i, j, .. = 1, ..., 8 are so(8) indices,
ijkl are the 35 + 35 scalars obeying the su (8) reality condition eq. (24)
and the fermions are weyl. the complex conjugation changes chirality, and
consequently both chiralities occur for the gravitini as well as the spin 1
2 elds.
thus, the theory is vector like. in writing eq. (82) we have assigned (energy)
dimension 1
2 to all the fermions, dimension 0 to the scalars and dimension 1 to
the vector elds. we nd that eq. (81) is in perfect agreement with eq. (82)
provided that we make the identications

2 2 .

(84)

the free parameters of the higher spin theory are therefore the gauge coupling
g and the inverse ads radius . the gauge coupling is introduced into the
full set of higher spin equations eqs. (38)-(43) by replacing   g . these
equations are consistent with the assignment of dimension 0 to the master
elds  and  provided that one makes use of the dimensionful parameter 
to rescale the component elds. consequently the interaction terms will have
negative powers of 2,16 and therefore the at limit in which   0 is singular.

4 on the uniqueness of the constraints

a natural question is whether there are curvature constraints other than eq. (33)
that realize the shse(8|4) dynamics irreducibly. however, the uniqueness of
the n = 8, d = 4 gauged supergravity suggests that there should not be much
room for interaction ambiguity. nonetheless, one might relax eq. (33). a
relaxation that preserves irreducibility amounts to introducing more auxiliary
elds over and above those already present in (y, ) and (y, ). a relax-
ation that does not maintain irreducibility could provide room in the curvature
for propagating shse(8|4) multiplets other than the gauge multiplet. these
two types of generalizations could be useful in nding an action or matter
couplings.
to relax the condition on rm while preserving the local symmetries one
must rst convert the curved spacetime indices on rm into at indices us-
ing a preferred invertible gauge eld such as the vierbein and then nd the
relaxed dshse(8|4) valued constraint. insisting on the yang-mills like form of
the dshse(8|4) gauge transformations this does not seem possible.
a, (a = 0, 1, 2, 3)
turning to the remaining constraints, setting r  = (a) 
a)  .
modies eq. (34) such that d  will be proportional to (a)
there are further integrability conditions involving z-dependence and the (un-
twisted) condition d a = 0. the full consequences of introducing the eld
a is not clear to us at present.
finally we consider modifying the constraint eq. (33) as

( d 

r = i

4hdz  dzv(   ) + dz   dz  v(   )i ,

(85)

23

where v is an arbitrary  function and  obeys eq. (18). the bianchi identities
d v(   ) = 0 and d v(   ) = 0 are integrable conditions which imply
the condition eq. (34). the constraint eq. (85) implies the non-linear reality
condition

   r   = v(v 1( r)  k) .

(86)

the constraint eq. (85) evidently describes a system with the same degrees of
freedom as the system described by eq. (33). to analyze further the conse-
quences of eq. (85) let us consider the eld redenition

 = f (   )   ,

(87)

where f is a  function. dening f(x) := f(x) and observing that
f(   ) = f(   )   and f+(   ) = f+(   ), we nd from
eq. (34) that

d   = 0 ,

d  = f+  dk .

(88)

moreover,  inherits a reality condition from  which in general is non-linear.
for real f it simplies to:

 = ( 

 + 

(89)
where 
 := f(   )  . thus, there is a set of apparently inequivalent
(see below) constraints given by eq. (85) where v is a complex  function
dened modulo the equivalence relation

+  k)  

for f = f ,

v  v 

if

v = v   f for f+ = 0 , f = f .

(90)

in other words the odd real part of v in eq. (85) can be redened away.
note that if one attempts to set v(x) = x by a eld redenition, then the
interactions from its even or imaginary parts resurface in the reality condition
on  and the right hand side of the expression for d . however, other types
of eld redenitions reduce the amount of freedom in v. this can be seen even
at the linearized level in a simple example as follows.
starting from v(x) = ax + , where a = |a|ei, a real eld redenition
  |a|1  leads to v(x) = eix. however, at the linearized level the phase
factor only enters the curvature constraints eqs. (56)-(57) and can therefore be
eliminated by redening the initial condition . in the notation   + +  +

24

0, where (m, n; ) = 0 for (m  n) > 0 and 0(m, n; ) = 0 for m 6= n,
the phase factor can be absorbed into the complex elds in  by redening
  ei. notice that unlike eq. (87) these redenitions treat  and 0
dierently.

5 discussion

despite the fact that the higher spin ads supergravity theory based on shse(8|4)
has no at space limit, such a limit may be achieved by spontaneous breaking
of the higher spin symmetries, followed by sending the ads radius to innity
in a suitable way.
another consequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking is that the higher spin
theory may be truncated to the gauged or ungauged n = 8, d = 4 supergravity
by sending the symmetry breaking parameter to innity. this truncation is
similar to the decoupling of gravity from matter by setting newtons constant
 equal to zero, in which case one does not necessarily require that the coupled
eld equations allow consistent truncation to the matter sector for nite .
spontaneous symmetry breaking may require scalars with a suitable potential
and couplings to the higher spin gauge elds. in particular, symmetry breaking
that allows truncation down to n = 8, d = 4 supergravity might be achieved
by using the 2 scalars at the rst level. however, a constant value for this eld
does not appear to solve the eld equations without involving higher spin elds.
therefore a more plausible scenario is to couple the theory to massive higher
spin multiplets containing elds which can trigger the symmetry breaking.
the n = 8 supersingleton propagating at the boundary of ads spacetime,
assumed to arise from the ads4  s7 compactication of the supermembrane,
serves as a spectrum generating representation for the massless higher spin
theory propagating in the bulk of the ads spacetime. as mentioned in the
introduction, it has been conjectured that the singletons play a fundamental
role in the description of the higher spin supergravity theory in the bulk. since
the massless spectra of the bulk and the boundary theories agree, the essential
test of the bulk/boundary duality is whether it is possible to represent the
shse(8|4) symmetry algebra as charges of anomaly free currents in the n = 8
supersingleton theory. we expect that the nonlinearities of the bulk theory
would then be reproduced by the interactions between composite singleton
states. the higher spin gauge coupling g can be introduced in the boundary
theory by rescaling the composite operators corresponding to the bulk gauge
elds. the boundary theory depends on  as well, and the relation eq. (84)
should be predicted by the boundary interactions. the boundary singleton the-
ory also involves massive composite states forming innite dimensional higher

25

spin multiplets. therefore the proposed bulk/boundary duality also yields
higher spin bulk interactions of both massless and massive sectors which could
trigger the spontaneous breaking of shse(8|4). while this program by and
large remains to be realized, the construction of higher spin currents in the
boundary of ads5 has been recently investigated 28,29.
another interesting issue is whether it is possible to accommodate the aux-
iliary spinor variable z in the boundary theory. the higher spin curvature
constraint might conceivably arise from the -like symmetry a by a superme-
mbrane worldvolume embedded into a target space extended by z-like dimen-
sions.
the generalization of the interacting higher spin eld theory to higher di-
mensions is another open problem. the intimate relations between m 2 and
m 5-branes makes it particularly interesting to study higher spin theory in
ads7. the (2, 0) tensor multiplet d = 6 is the doubleton representation of the
ads7 supergroup and its symmetric tensor product yields an innite dimen-
30. the superdoubleton theory
sional multiplet of massless higher spins in ads7
living at the boundary of ads7 would now arise from the ads7  s4 compact-
ication of the m 5-brane, and we expect that it generates the dynamics of the
higher spin extension of the maximal gauged supergravity in d = 7.
it is tantalizing to consider the possibility of a massless higher spin eld the-
ory directly in d = 11. even though a standard ads supergroup does not
exist in d = 11, a generalized version of such a group and its singleton like
representations have been constructed 31. whether an action, or equations of
motion, for these representations can be written down in the d = 10 boundary
of ads11 remains to be seen. in this context, it is interesting to note that the
representations of so(9) as the little group classifying the massless degrees of
freedom of d = 11 supergravity has been studied 32 with interesting results
that suggest the existence of higher spin massless elds in d = 11.
