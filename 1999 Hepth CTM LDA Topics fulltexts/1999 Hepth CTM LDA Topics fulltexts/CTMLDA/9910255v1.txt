abstract

i review recent results on conformal eld theories in four dimensions and quantum eld theories
interpolating between conformal xed points, supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric. the talk is
structured in three parts: i) central charges, ii) anomalous dimensions and iii) quantum irreversibility.
xiv international workshop on high energy physics and quantum field theory, moscow, june,
1999.

the family of theories, in general uv-free, that interpolate between two conformal xed points, in
such a way that the ir limit is reachable by (resummed) perturbation theory, is called conformal window.
the conformal window, which can be viewed as the convergence radius of the perturbative series, does
not contain qcd, where other non-perturbative eects have to be taken into account. yet it is the region
separating the perturbative regime from qcd. understanding the conformal window better can be a
source of insight into the low-energy limit of qcd itself.

in two dimensions conformal eld theories have an innite symmetry [1] and are sometimes exactly
solvable.
in higher dimensions, there are simplications in the presence of supersymmetry and exact
results are available. very general theorems, implications of unitarity, give exact results even in the
absence of supersymmetry.

here i summarize the research that i undertook on these issues over the past three years. the paper is
divided in three sections: i) central charges, based on ref. [2]; ii) anomalous dimensions, on refs. [3, 4, 5];
and iii) quantum irreversibility, on refs. [6, 7, 8].

1. central charges

i consider, as a concrete example, n=1 supersymmetric qcd with group g = su (nc) and nf quarks in
the fundamental representation. i compute the infrared values of the gravitational central charges called
c and a in the conformal window 3nc/2 < nf < 3nc.

the theory contains gauge superelds v a, a = 1, . . . , n 2

c  1, and chiral quark and antiquark super-
 and majorana gauginos a, and the complex scalars i and i and majorana spinors i and i,

elds, qi and eqi,  = 1, . . . , nc, i = 1, . . . , nf , whose physical components are the gauge potentials

respectively. this theory has the usual gauge interactions and no superpotential.

the ir limit.

r is the lowest component of the supercurrent supereld j  that also contains the stress tensor and
supersymmetry currents. to study the gravitational central charges we introduce the background metric
g and source v for the r-current. in these background elds the trace and r-anomalies are related
by supersymmetry and read, in a critical theory,

we include a factor of g in the denition of r. here w is the weyl tensor and er is the dual

of the curvature tensor, the second term of  being the euler density; v is the eld strength of v.
the coecient a of the euler density is an independent constant, while the coecients of the (w )2
and (v )2 terms are related. this can be proved by observing that the two-point function of j   has a
unique structure in superspace [11],

observe that cir and air are non-negative throughout the conformal window, in agreement with their
nature of central charges. in particular, the inequality cir  0 follows from reection positivity of the

the dierence auv  air is everywhere positive in the conformal window, as conjectured by cardy [13].
this phenomenon is called quantum irreversibility. instead, the dierence cuv  cir is positive in part of
the conformal window and negative in the rest.
a corollary of the above derivation is that both c and a are constant on families of conformal eld

theories, i.e. they are marginally uncorrected.

the procedure that i have illustrated can be applied any time there is a unique r-current and a
conformal window. the eects of mass perturbations and symmetry breaking can be straightforwardly
included. the analysis of a wide class of models, done in [14], conrms the conclusions just derived, in
particular the inequalities auv  air  0, on which i have more to say in section 3.
2. anomalous dimensions

the second class of quantities that characterize a conformal eld theory are the anomalous dimensions.
given that the operator-product expansion of the stress-tensor does not close, of primary interest is the
spectrum of anomalous dimensions of the (innitely many) higher-spin currents generated by the singular
terms of the t t ope. in general the classication is not simple, but with the help of supersymmetry
we can reach this goal in various models. using theorems discovered in the context of the deep inelastic
scattering, in particular the ferraragattogrillo theorem [15] and the nachtmann theorem [16], several
conclusions about strongly coupled conformal eld theories can be derived. these conclusions hold also
for non-supersymmetric theories.

the algorithm to work out the currents of the quantum conformal algebra starts from the stress tensor
t and the spin-0 component 0 of the konishi multiplet, which is the rst operator generated by the t t
ope [11], and proceeds via a combination of two steps:

i) supersymmetry, which moves vertically in the algebra, i.e. changes the dimension of the operators

and therefore their singularity in the ope;

ii) orthogonalization of two-point functions, which moves horizontally, i.e. at the same singularity

level in the ope.

i illustrate this very briey in the case of the n=2 vector multiplet. the current multiplets have
length 2 in spin units, in particular the multiplet of the stress tensor. there is one multiplet for each
spin, even or odd.

the vector, spinor and scalar contributions to the currents of the n=2 vector multiplet (a,i, m, n ),

i = 1, 2, are schematically given in the free-eld limit by

j v = f +
av = f +

 oddf 

 , j f =
 , af =

i oddi, j s = m evenm + n evenn,
i5 eveni, as = 2im oddn,

plus improvement terms [17], where  even/odd denotes an even/odd string of derivative operators  ,
j ,a denote the even and odd (axial) currents, and v, f, s mean vector, fermion, scalar. a simple set of
rules determines the operation (i). the result is

j s  2af + 2as, j f  8av + as, j v  2av +
af  8j v + j s, as  2j f + 2j s, av  2j v +

1
4af ,
1
4 j f .

this operation raises the spin by one unit and it is independent of the spin on the basis (j s,f,v , as,f,v ),
which is, however, not diagonal in the sense of point (ii). the diagonalization produces the correct
higher-spin currents, which are rational combinations of (j s,f,v , as,f,v ).

the current multiplet of the stress tensor reads in particular

t0 =

2j s
0 ,

t2 = 8j v

2  2j f

1 + as

t1 = af

2 + j s
2 .
it contains also a spin-1 current t1 (an r-current) and a spin-0 mass operator t0.
one can proceed similarly for the hypermultiplet and then combine the two in an n=2 nite theory,
which is the case we are interested in here. this family is parametrized by a coupling constant g as well
as the rank nc of the gauge group, which we assume to be su (nc). multiplets having dierent minimal
spins are orthogonal, but some pairs of multiplets have the same minimal spin. these, in general, mix
under renormalization. in particular, there is a multiplet t  mixing with t .
at g dierent from zero the higher-spin currents acquire anomalous dimensions (and are extended
to include other supersymmetric partners that disappear when g = 0). let h2s denote the minimal
anomalous dimensions of the even-spin levels. the ferraragattogrillonachtmann (fggn) theorem
states that, starting with the spin-2 level, the spectrum h2s is positive, increasing and convex:

0  h2s  h2(s+1),

h2(s+1)  h2s  h2s  h2(s1).

the most important implication of this theorem is that the ope algebra generated by the multiplet of
the stress tensor does close, in some special situation that we now describe.

we can classify conformal eld theory in two classes:
i) open conformal eld theory, when the quantum conformal algebra contains an innite number of

(generically non-conserved) currents;

ii) closed conformal eld theory, when the quantum conformal algebra closes with a nite set of

(conserved) currents.

the fggn theorem implies in particular that the spectrum is identically zero if one h2s is zero, and

identically innity if one h2s is innity. precisely:
a) if h2s = 0 for some s > 1, then h2s = 0 s > 0, and
b) if h2s =  for some s > 1, then h2s =  s > 1.
equipped with this, we can describe the moduli space of conformal eld theory as a ball centred in
free-eld theory. as a radius r one can take the value of any h2s with s > 1. the boundary sphere is the
set of closed theories. the bulk is the set of open theories.
let us discuss the two cases r = 0 and r =  separately.
it is a rigorous and completely general consequence of the theorem that when r =  all current mul-
tiplets have innite anomalous dimensions and decouple from the ope (with the only possible exception
of t , which is screened by t ). supersymmetry plays an important role here, since each multiplet
necessarily has some component with even spin, and therefore falls under the range of the nachtmann
theorem for r  .
the limit in which r   is the limit of maximally strong interaction, in the sense that once the
quantum conformal algebra closes, there is no way to make the interaction any stronger. it is not sucient
to take g  : in n=4 supersymmetric yangmills theory, indeed, the g  1/g duality suggests that
the limit g   at nc xed is free and not closed. to have the maximally strong interaction, one needs
to take the large-nc limit at the same time.
in the limit r  0 some currents with non-vanishing anomalous dimension might survive, in principle,
since r is sensitive only to the minimal anomalous dimension of each even-spin level. it is nevertheless
reasonable to expect that r  0 reduces to a free-eld theory, and this is what we conjecture. indeed, no
interacting theory with innitely many conserved currents is known. an interesting case, in this respect,
is n=4 supersymmetric yangmills theory, where the spectrum h2s includes the full set of anomalous
dimensions and therefore r  0 ensures that all higher-spin currents generated by the ope are conserved.

the picture that has emerged can be summarized by the following statements.
i) closed conformal eld theory is the boundary of the moduli space of open conformal eld theory.
ii) closed conformal eld theory is the exact solution to the strongly coupled large-nc limit of open

conformal eld theory.

iii) a closed quantum conformal algebra determines uniquely the associated conformal eld theory.
iv) a closed quantum conformal algebra is determined uniquely by two central charges, c and a.
we now comment on point (iv). the basic procedure to determine the quantum conformal algebra
of closed conformal eld theory (the so-called fusion rules) can be applied to any set of nite operators
(for example, non-singlet currents with respect to some avour group), although we focus on the minimal
algebra (namely the one of the stress tensor) for the sake of generality. the procedure consists of the
following steps. one studies the free-eld ope of an open conformal eld theory and organizes the
currents into orthogonal and mixing multiplets. secondly, one turns a weak interaction on and computes
the anomalous dimensions of the operators to the lowest orders in the perturbative expansion. finally,
one drops all the currents with a non-vanishing anomalous dimension. more generically, one can postulate
a set of spin-0, 1 and 2 currents, which we call t0,1,2, and study the most general ope algebra consistent
with closure and unitary.

plus descendants and regular terms. we have emphasized those coecients that are proportional to
(1  a/c). we observe that

 the c = a closed algebra is unique and coincides with the n=4 one.
 given c and a, there is a unique closed conformal algebra with n=2 supersymmetry.
c has a natural interpretation as the central extension of the algebra, while the combination (1  a/c)
there might be a slightly more general, but still closed, structure, if the multiplet t , which mixes
with t , does not drop. this algebra is determined by c, a and the anomalous dimension of t .
finally, we observe that in n=1 (and non-supersymmetric) theories the multiplet of the stress-tensor
will not contain spin-0 partners, in general, but at most the r-current. the above considerations stop at
the spin-2 and 1 levels of the ope, but the procedure to determine the closed algebra is the same. what
is more subtle is to identify the physical situation that the closed limit should describe.

3. quantum irreversibility

quantum eld theory denes a natural bre bundle. the base manifold is the space of physical correlators
and the bre is the space of scheme choices, with suitable regularity restrictions. a projection onto the
base manifold is well dened and ensures scheme independence of the physical correlators. we call this
bundle the scheme bundle.

the scheme bundle is equipped with a metric f and a fundamental one-form , dened as follows.
consider the two-point function of the trace  of the stress tensor. in four dimensions, we normalize it
as

h(x) (0)i =

154

1

2(t)f (t)

.

|x|8

reection positivity ensures that f  0. actually, f is strictly positive throughout the rg ow, since
the zeros of the two-point function are parametrized precisely by the factor 2. therefore f is a metric in
the space of coupling constants, dened on the bre. the beta function is also dened on the bre, since
it is scheme-dependent, but the combination 2(t)f (t) is scheme-independent and therefore lives on the
base manifold. it is not a metric on the base manifold, however, since it vanishes at the critical points.

the fundamendal one-form  is dened as

in the trace anomaly coupled to an external gravitational eld. gn is a non-trivial total derivative, i.e.
the total derivative of a non-gauge-covariant current (the chernsimons form) and so it is dened up to
trivial total derivatives, the divergence of a gauge-covariant current. the topological numbers calculated

a convenient normalization of an is that it be equal to 1 for a real scalar eld, and reads in general

(12)

for free-eld theories with ns real scalar elds, nf dirac fermions and nv vectors. in n = 4 we change
the normalization of a according to this convention (f4 = 11, v4 = 62) and write

a = auv  air =z ir

uv

(13)

the total rg ow of a is the integral of the fundamental one-form  between the xed points. quantum
irreversibility is measured by the invariant (i.e.
scheme-independent) area of the graph of the beta
function between the xed points. in this integral, scheme independence is reparametrization invariance.
this formula can be checked to the fourth-loop order in the most general renormalizable theory.
here we focus on qcd in the conformal window in the neighbourhood of the asymptotic freedom point
nf = 11
2 nc. the strategy for computing higher-loop corrections to the trace anomaly was developed in
refs. [18]. see [7] for its extension to six dimensions.

collecting the results of these references in a general formula, the third-loop rg ow of a reads

auv  air =

fuv22

ir + o(3

ir),

where 1 and 2 are the rst two coecients of the beta function, () = 1 + 22 + o(3). formula
(13) gives exactly the same result. concretely, with nf avours and nc colours we have

auv  air =

44

ncnf(cid:18)1

nc

nf(cid:19)2

.

in supersymmetric qcd the prediction can be compared with the exact formula (7). the check can
be extended to the fourth-loop order [6], in both the supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric cases. in
six dimensions, formula (11) has been checked to the fourth-loop order in the theory 3 [7].

i now discuss the extension of these results to all orders. renormalization can be seen [6] as the
restoration of positivity (or, better, boundedness from below) of the generating functional of 1pi diagrams
in the euclidean framework. this positivity is in general violated by the regularization procedure and
divergences.

here, we consider the induced action for the conformal factor . despite the fact that  is an external
source, the positivity property holds because  couples to , an evanescent operator. at most, we might
have to adjust the unique free parameter (coupling constant) at our disposal: the a ambiguity.

the quantum-irreversibility formula is derivable from the statement:

the induced eective action sr for the conformal factor  [19] is positive-denite throughout the rg ow,
if and only if it is positive-denite at a given energy,
which implies the a-theorem:

i) a is non-negative;
ii) the total rg ow of a is non-negative and equal to the invariant area of the beta function:

auv  air = z ir

uv

d ()f ()  0.

now, sr[] is the solution of the equation  = e4 sr[]

the two terms of sr[] have to be separately positive. in particular, positivity of the rst term implies
a > 0 in the ir if a > 0 in the uv. this is true, since afree > 0 in a free-eld theory.

the quantity a is dened up to an additive, coupling-independent constant and needs to be normalized
at a given energy scale. the quantity whose rg ow is given by (13) is precisely a and our statement
amounts to showing that a, which is certainly non-negative, is equal to a.

correlators is of fundamental importance.

an extension of these ideas to odd dimensions, which is not straightforward since there is no trace
anomaly in external gravity in odd dimensions, can be obtained by dimensional continuation. the
resulting formula is testable, in principle, in models interpolating between pairs of free-eld xed points.

finally, i stress that the phenomenon of quantum irreversibility is proper to the dynamical scale ,
i.e. it is the intrinsic drift of the renormalization group. explicit scales (masses, newtons constant and
other dimensionful parameters) need not be described by formula (13). moreover, formula (13) has to
be replaced by a more complicated expression also when the stress tensor is not truly nite, but mixes
with other operators (a well-known example is the 4-theory - see sect. 2.3 of [6] for details). these are
signals of the richness of higher-dimensional conformal eld theories with respect to the two-dimensional
ones. there is, nevertheless, a remarkable subset, the set c = a, where the two-dimensional properties
are best reproduced. this set admits a generalization to arbitrary dimension and it is dened as the set
of conformal eld theories having a trace anomaly quadratic in the ricci tensor and ricci curvature [8].
