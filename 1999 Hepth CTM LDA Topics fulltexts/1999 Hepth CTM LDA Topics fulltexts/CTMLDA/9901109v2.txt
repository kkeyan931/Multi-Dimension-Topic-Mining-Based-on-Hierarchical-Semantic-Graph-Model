abstract

we propose a new constraint on the structure of strongly coupled,
asymptotically free eld theories. the constraint takes the form of
an inequality limiting the number of degrees of freedom in the in-
frared description of a theory relative to the number of underlying,
ultraviolet degrees of freedom. we apply the inequality to a variety
of theories (both supersymmetric and nonsupersymmetric), where it
agrees with all known results and leads to interesting new constraints
on low energy spectra. we discuss the relation of this constraint to
renormalization group c-theorems.

1 introduction

four dimensional eld theories have been remarkably successful at describing

nature at energies less than several hundred gev. unfortunately progress

at higher energies has been frustrated by a dearth of general theoretical

tools that apply to strongly coupled models. our understanding of eld

theory comes largely from perturbation theory (which applies to weakly cou-

pled systems) and from qcd (where specic strong dynamics may be com-

pared to experiment). there are many examples where this understanding

is inadequatefor example, even the question of chiral symmetry break-

ing in a qcd-like gauge theory with a large number of avors is unsettled

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

recently new tools have appeared in the context of supersymmetric gauge

theories. known collectively as duality, these ideas have produced convinc-

ing pictures of the pattern of symmetry breaking in many strongly coupled

supersymmetric theories. the wide variety of low-energy phenomena that

appear is remarkable, including dual gauge groups, conformal xed points,

chiral symmetry breaking, etc. these results are obtained without a detailed

solution for the dynamics at strong coupling, but rely on symmetries, inspired

guesswork, and general properties of supersymmetry. this shows that gen-

eral constraints on the low energy properties of strongly coupled eld theories

are enormously useful, especially when a complete solution is unavailable.

the most powerful general constraint known is the anomaly matching

1

condition introduced by t hooft [6]. generally, we may dene an anomaly

as a residue of the pole in a particular multi-current correlation function . as

discussed by t hooft, this number is independent of renormalization scale,

and may therefore be computed at short distances, or equally well at long

distances:

air = au v .

(1)

as the residue of a pole, the anomaly only receives contributions from phys-

ical massless degrees of freedom. if the short distance theory is weakly cou-

pled (like an asymptotically free gauge theory) or calculable by other means,

the anomaly condition provides an immediate relation of the massless spec-

trum to the short distance physics, constraining the appearance of massless

fermions and nambu-goldstone bosons. anomaly matching, as implemen-

tation of this condition is often called, has led to useful constraints on the

possible low energy realizations of chiral gauge theories [7, 8], as well as

qcd-like (vector-like) gauge theories [9, 10]. anomalies have also played a

fundamental role in discovering and checking the dualities of supersymmetric

gauge theories [11, and references therein].

in this paper we propose a new constraint on the structure of strongly

coupled eld theories. before stating and discussing this constraint, we note

that, although the anomaly condition does not forbid the appearance of addi-

tional (vector-like) massless particles, it is usually assumed that the spectrum

contains no massless particles that this condition does not require. that is,

if there are relevant operators not forbidden by symmetries that would pro-

2

duce masses, it is (technically) unnatural to assume that these operators are

absent. consequently we might say that nature generally abhors massless

particles.

in fact when faced with the task of guessing the massless spectrum of a

strongly coupled eld theory, we are often guided by the idea that the number

of massless particles is as small as possible. since the anomaly condition can

always be satised by a massless spectrum identical to the ultraviolet degrees

of freedom, this would disfavor massless composites if the number of such

composites is too large.

in elevating this casual notion to a formal principle, we need precise

denitions of the number of degrees of freedom in both the infrared and ul-

traviolet. although there are no unique such objects, we will choose to dene

quantities related to the free energy of the eld theory. we will consider only

renormalizable theories, for which the free energy may be rendered nite and

cuto independent by adjusting the vacuum energy to zero, renormalizing

a nite set of parameters, and then removing the cuto (holding physical

quantities and the temperature xed). for reasons described later, we will

consider only asymptotically free theories.

in terms of this properly renormalized free energy per unit volume, f ,

(which is also equal to minus the pressure), the quantity that we will use to

characterize the number of infrared degrees of freedom is

fir   lim
t 0

f
t 4

90

(2)

where t is the temperature. for a free eld theory, fir is simply the number

of massless bosons plus 7/8 times the number of massless fermions. for an

asymptotically free theory, the corresponding expression in the large t limit

mesaures the ultraviolet degrees of freedom in a similar way:

fu v   lim
t 

f
t 4

90
2 .

(3)

our qualitative discussion above suggests the new constraint fir  fu v .

in section 2 we formulate this idea precisely and describe how this inequality

(assuming that it is correct) leads to restrictions on the physical properties

of strongly coupled eld theories. two examples are considered: a super-

symmetric su(n) gauge theory with f avors, and a non-supersymmetric

version of the same theory. in both cases the inequality will constrain the

low energy structure. in section 3 we describe a (failed) route to a proof of

the inequality. the line of argument is nevertheless interesting, and leads

to a deeper understanding of the inequality and its relation to so-called c-

theorems [12]. in section 4, we discuss the t dependence for the two ex-

amples mentioned above. in section 5 we apply the inequality to a variety

of strongly coupled eld theories. finally, in section 6 we summarize and

conclude.

2 the inequality

our conjectured inequality is

fir  fu v

4

(4)

these limits are well dened for theories with both uv and ir xed points.

however the inequality can be violated in the presence of non-trivial uv

xed points, as we show in section 5.2. hence our examples will involve

asymptotically free gauge theories, and most will be infrared free as well,

although the ir degrees of freedom may be dierent from those in the uv.

in eld theories with weakly coupled xed points the free energy, ap-

pearing in the denition of f , may be computed perturbatively. to zeroth

order in couplings the low-temperature free energy density in three spatial

dimensions is

ff ree(t )  

2t 4
90

[nb +

7
8

2nf ],

(5)

where nb is the number of massless (real) bosonic elds, and nf is the

number of massless (two-component) fermionic elds. we have neglected the

contributions of any massive elds, which vanish exponentially as t  0. a

similar expression applies in the innite t limit, with nb and nf including

massive as well as massless elds. these expressions are exact in the case

of free xed points and approximately correct for theories governed by weak

xed points. for specic theories we may include perturbative corrections.

2.1 susy example

for our rst example we consider a susy su(n) gauge theory with f avors

(quarks and antiquarks) of massless fermions and associated superpart-

ners. the theory has a free uv xed point if the number of avors is less

than 3 times the number of colors, f < 3n. in this case the quantity fu v

5

may be calculated using eq. (5) to give

fu v = h2(n 2  1) + 4nfi (1 +

7
8

) .

(6)

the analysis of seiberg [13] suggests that the infrared behavior of this

theory is alternatively described through the use of f avors of massless

magnetic quarks transforming according to the fundamental representation

of a dual gauge group su(f  n), along with f 2 massless meson chiral

superelds. this theory is infrared free provided f  3n/2. under these

circumstances fir is:

fir = h2((f  n)2  1) + 4(f  n)f + 2f 2i (1 +

7
8

) .

(7)

thus our fundamental inequality becomes

2[(f  n)2  1] + 4(f  n)f + 2f 2  2(n 2  1) + 4nf

(8)

because fir grows quadratically with the number of avors, this inequal-

ity limits the values of f for which the low energy theory can consist of

massless magnetic degrees of freedom with infrared free coupling. remark-

ably, this inequality gives the bound f  (3/2)n, corresponding precisely

to the boundary of the weak magnetic phase determined by the analysis of

seiberg [13]. at the boundary f = (3/2)n the inequality is saturated1. we

will show that the inequality continues to hold for f > (3/2)n in section

5.2.

1the simplest example is the case n = 2: su (2) gauge theory with 3 avors. the the-
ory connes and has an infrared-free dual description containing only a meson supereld,
and fu v = fir = 30(1 + 7/8).

6

2.2 non-susy example

for our second example we consider the non-supersymmetric version of the

same su(n) gauge theory, with f massless quarks (and antiquarks). the

theory has a free uv xed point for f < 11n/2. based on real qcd we

expect the su(f )  su(f ) chiral symmetries of this theory to be realized in

the nambu-goldstone modeat least for small enough f/n. if we assume

that this is the case, the ir theory consists of f 2  1 nambu-goldstone

bosons. the derivative interactions of these particles are irrelevant in the

infrared, and consequently this theory is described by a free ir xed point.

at these free uv and ir xed points we may use eq. (5) to compute fir

and fu v :

fir = f 2  1

fu v = 2(n 2  1) +

7
8

4nf ,

and our inequality becomes

f 2  1  2(n 2  1) +

7
8

4nf ,

or, since f must be positive

f  4sn 2 

16
81

.

(9)

(10)

(11)

since n must be 2 or larger, and f and n must both be integral, this is

equivalent to f < 4n. remarkably, our inequality says that for the number

of avors larger than or equal to four times the number of colors, this gauge

theory cannot break the full set of chiral symmetries!

7

this new bound on the onset of the chiral phase transition (f  12 for

su(3)) is well above the transitional values suggested by preliminary lattice

simulations [3, 4]. it is very close, however, to the value that emerges from

the use of a continuum gap equation together with the assumption that the

coupling is governed by an infrared xed point appearing in the perturbative

 function [2]. in fact, a combination of the ladder gap equation and the

two-loop beta function give a critical value f crit/n = (100n 2  66)/(25n 2 

15)( 4 as n  ). the reliability of this result is far from clear, however,

since higher order eects are not obviously small. so whether the chiral phase

transition saturates the inequality in this way or takes place at a lower value

of f/n remains an open question.

3 relation to c

having shown that the inequality eq. (4) is consistent with other analyses

of the susy su(n) theory and that it leads to a new result for qcd-like

theories, we next discuss why it might be true generally. as an attempt

at proof we may dene a function f (t ) at all scales in an obvious way, as

minus the free energy density divided by t raised to the number of spatial

dimensions plus one (this extension away from 4 space-time dimensions will

prove useful shortly):

f (t )  

f
t d+1 d

(12)

where d is a constant chosen such that the contribution to f (t ) from a free

bosonic degree of freedom is 1. the quantities fir and fu v are just the limits

8

of this function as t approaches zero and  respectively.

as a rst step we dierentiate the function f with respect to t . using

the standard relations t f /t = u  p, f = p where p is the pressure

and u is the internal energy density, we have

t

f
t

= d

u  dp
t d+1

 d



t d+1

(13)

where  is the (thermal average of the) trace of the energy-momentum tensor.

for a conformally invariant theory, the trace of the energy-momentum tensor

is zero. under these circumstances we see that f is a constant, and fir

is equal to fu v . of course the theories that we are interested in are not

conformally invariantthe lack of conformal invariance arises from a scale

dependence of coupling constants through renormalization. consequently we

expect the dierence between fu v and fir to arise from the renormalization

group ow from the ultraviolet to the infrared.

if  is positive along this

trajectory, fir will necessarily be smaller than fu v , proving our inequality.

thus our inequality would follow from a positivity condition on the ther-

mal average of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor; that is, from pos-

itivity of u  dp. for non-interacting systems, massive modes always have

p < u/d whereas massless modes have p = u/d. even for interacting classi-

cal systems we expect these conditions to remain valid. unfortunately the

situation in quantum theories is not so simple [14, 15].

consider, for example, a classically scale-invariant gauge eld theory. in

9

this case the trace of the energy-momentum tensor is given by:

 = 2


g

trg2

(14)

where trg2 is the trace over gauge indices of the square of the gauge eld-

strength, as well as over the thermal density matrix, and  is the rg beta

function. note that, at least in perturbation theory, the thermal average

of the eld-strength squared is negative (magnetic uctuations are less-well

screened than electric uctuations). therefore a negative beta function leads

to a positive , as we desire.

unfortunately this observation immediately suggests examples of negative

. if the low energy theory is a gauge eld theory governed by a free infrared

xed point, then the  function will be positive at weak coupling where trg2

is known to be negative. this is realized if the low energy theory is either an

abelian theory with massless fermions or a non-abelian theory with matter

content sucient to render it infrared free. the susy su(n) theory in the

weak magnetic phase, discussed in the previous section, is precisely such an

example.

of course this is not a counter-example to our conjectured inequality: the

fact that f (t ) is not monotonic does not contradict the inequality involving

fir and fu v . ( we have already noted that the susy su(n) theory in the

weak magnetic phase does in fact satisfy the inequality.) it means, however,

that a proof of this inequality will be more involved than the simple argument

used here.

10

this discussion also indicates why we restrict our attention to asymptot-

ically free theories. negative contributions to  decrease fu v  fir; if these

contributions persist over a large temperature range, the inequality will be vi-

olated. since operators in the hamiltonian contribute to  according to their

scaling dimension, positive operators with a coupling constant of negative

mass dimension (positive irrelevant operators) make a negative contribu-

tion to . a renormalizable theory with a non-trivial uv xed point may

have such an operator which can make a negative contribution to  over a

large range of temperature, invalidating the inequality. (an explicit example

of this type is mentioned at the end of section 5.2.) we thus consider only

asymptotically free theories.

note that had the function f (t ) been monotonic, we would have proven a

c-theorem: the existence of a function that is monotonic along rg trajec-

tories. for example, in one spatial dimension the function f (t ) is monotonic,

since the energy density is always greater than or equal to the pressure in

the thermal state. but the value of this function at any xed point (where

 = 0) is simply the conventionally dened central charge of the correspond-

ing conformal eld theory2. the decrease in central charge between xed

points along an rg trajectory is the c-theorem of zamolodchikov [12].

our analysis implies that the existence of a monotonic function of t,

equal to f (t ) at conformal xed points, would lead to the inequality eq.

2although our argument involves a ow in temperature, the usual rg arguments and
dimensional analysis may be used to rewrite everything in terms of a change in scale
parameter, .

11

(4). we have already demonstrated that such a function does not exist in

general theories, for dimensions larger than two. even for asymptotically free

theories, if such a function does exist, it is clearly not f (t ) itself. we have

been unable to nd an alternative monotonic function for asymptotically free

theories, nor have we been able to establish its impossibility. note that the

existence of such a monotonic function, while providing a proof of eq. (4), is

not a necessary condition for the correctness of our much milder inequality.

there have been several attempts to prove a c-theorem in 4 dimensions

[16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. the values of these c-functions at xed points are

numerically quite dierent from fu v and fir. the inequalities similar to

eq. (4) that would arise as consequences of these c-theorems in general do

not signicantly constrain the spectrum of 4 dimensional gauge eld theo-

ries. the examples of section 2 have already shown that our inequality does

place interesting constraints on the spectrum of 4 dimensional gauge theories.

other examples will be presented in section 5.

4 t dependence

we have stressed that the inequality eq.(4) does not require the monotonicity

of f (t ), and we have noted that for one example in which the inequality is

satised (the supersymmetric su(n) theory in the weak magnetic phase),

monotonicity is violated. in this section, we examine in more detail the t

dependence of f (t ) for this example and for the other example of section

two: the non-supersymmetric su(n) theory.

in each case, we record the

12

t dependence for both the t   and t  0 limits, where perturbation

theory may be employed.

4.1 susy su (n ) theory

for t  , perturbation theory in the underlying, asymptotically free elec-

tric theory may be used, giving [22]

f (t ) = fu v  (n 2  1)(n + 3f )

45g2
e(t )
322 + ...,

(15)

where fu v is given by eq. (6) and where t sets the scale for the electric

coupling ge. since the  function is negative, g2

e (t ) decreases as t increases,

leading to positive  and f /t , as discussed in section 3.

for t  0, with f  3n/2, perturbation theory gives

f (t ) = fir((f n)21)(4f n)

45g2

m(t )

322

3f 2(f n)

45y2(t )
322 +..., (16)

where fir is given by eq. (7), gm is the magnetic gauge coupling, and y

is the yukawa coupling of the magnetic theory. the g2

m term is obtained

from the g2

e term in eq.

(15) by the replacement n  f  n. the y2

term is obtained by evaluating the two-loop diagrams involving the yukawa

couplings and the four-scalar couplings that arise from the superpotential of

the magnetic theory.

since the theory is infrared free for f  3n/2, both couplings increase

with t , showing that  and t f /t are negative for small t . still, the

inequality is satised.

13

4.2 su (n ) theory

we next record the t dependence for the non-supersymmetric su(n) theory

[23, eg]. for t  , perturbation theory gives

f (t ) = fu v  10(n 2  1)(n + 5f/n)

g2(t )
162 + ...,

(17)

where fu v is given by eq.

(9) and g is the gauge coupling. asymptotic

freedom leads to positive  and f /t .

for t  0, corrections to the free-eld behavior of the nambu-goldstone

bosons may be computed using chiral perturbation theory. the leading cor-

rection arises at second order in 1/f 2

 , where f is the nambu-goldstone

decay constant, and contains a chiral logarithm. the result, for t << f, is

[24]

f (t ) = fir +

f 2(f 2  1)

144

t 4
f 4


ln(cid:18)f

t (cid:19) + . . . ,

(18)

where fir is given by eq. (9). thus for small t , f (t ) increases with t .

interestingly, for the non-supersymmetric theory in the nambu-goldstone

phase, the function f (t ) is positive-monotonic for both large t and small t ,

the limits in which it may be computed reliably, using perturbation theory.

5 other examples

in this section we apply our inequality to several example eld theories for

which weakly coupled uv and ir descriptions have been proposed. we rst

14

discuss a number of additional asymptotically-free supersymmetric theories

with infrared-free dual descriptions. we nd the inequality to be satised in

all cases. we then discuss the supersymmetric su(n) theory in the regime

f > 3n/2, where the dual magnetic theory exhibits a non-trivial infrared

xed point. the inequality is again satised where it can be checked per-

turbatively. finally, we go on to discuss qed in 2+1 dimensions, where the

inequality gives an interesting constraint on the infrared spectrum.

5.1

infrared-free supersymmetric examples

all examples in this section are supersymmetric theories for which infrared-

free dual descriptions have been proposed. we present each example in a for-

mat where we rst describe the electric theory by giving its gauge group,

matter content, and superpotential. we then give the gauge group and mat-

ter content of the dual magnetic description (and a reference to where this

dual was rst described in the literature). we show the range of avors for

which the magnetic description exists and is infrared-free. in each case, this

is well within the avor range for which the electric theory is asymptotically

free. this is therefore the regime for which free eld theory calculations of

fu v and fir are exact. we then quote the answers for fu v and fir which

are obtained by simply counting the number of superelds and multiplying

them by a factor of 2(1 + 7/8) = 15/4, the contribution to the free energy

from a single free supereld. finally we compute the constraint following

from fir  fu v and check whether it is satised in the range of avors for

15

which the calculation is valid. we nd this to be the case in every example.

a. the electric theory has so(n) gauge group with f vectors and no tree

level superpotential. the magnetic dual has gauge group so(f n +4) with

f vectors and f (f + 1)/2 meson superelds [25]. as one can see from the

following table the inequality is satised in the entire range of avors where

our calculation of the f s is applicable. interestingly, as in the case of susy

qcd the inequality is saturated at the boundary between the conformal and

free phases of the dual description, which lies at f = (3/2)(n  2).

the table the inequality is satised in the entire range of avors where our

calculation of the f s is applicable. as in the cases of so and su susy

qcd, the inequality is saturated at the boundary between the conformal

and free phases of the dual description, f = (3/2)(n + 1).

is: f avors of dual quarks, a chiral supereld transforming in the adjoint

of the dual gauge group, and 2f 2 mesons3. as we see from the table the

inequality is satised in the entire range of avors where our calculation of

the f s is applicable.

here and in the following the upper (lower) sign corresponds to the so (sp)

model. again we nd that the inequality is satised in the entire range of

e. in addition to the examples above we have also applied the predictions of

the inequality to s-conning theories. these are n = 1 susy gauge theo-

ries with no tree level superpotential which conne without chiral symmetry

breaking. all s-conning theories have been identied and their ir spectra

are known [30]. we nd that the conned spectra for all these theories satisfy

the inequality. saturation occurs only for the s-conning su(2) theory with

3 avors which we already mentioned in the footnote of section 2.1.

4in the case of sp both n and f are even.

18

5.2 supersymmetric example with an interacting in-

frared fixed point

we consider susy qcd for f > (3/2)n. recall from section 2 that in

this regime fu v is smaller than fir computed at zero (magnetic) coupling.

thus it seems that our inequality might be violated. however, precisely at

f = (3/2)n the magnetic theory ceases to be infrared free and instead ows

to an interacting xed point. at this xed point fir receives corrections from

the relevant interactions. these corrections are calculable in perturbation

theory if the xed point is weakly coupled and  as we will show below are

of the correct sign and magnitude to ensure that the inequality holds. these

results are summarized in figure 1. which shows fu v and fir as a function

of f/n in the neighborhood of f = (3/2)n.

to calculate the corrections we choose large n and f with f tuned

slightly larger than (3/2)n. to see that for these values of n and f the

xed point of the magnetic theory is perturbative, dene the small parameter

  (2f 3n)/n which measures the departure (in f ) from the free magnetic

phase. then the xed point values for the couplings of the magnetic theory

may be computed in terms of  by setting the two-loop  functions for the

gauge and yukawa couplings to zero. we nd

show f 0

ir, the expression for fir with no interactions included.

we now check that the inequality is also satised in this interacting theory

by computing and comparing fu v and fir at small . equation (6) expanded

to rst order in  gives

fu v = 15n 2 (1 +

1
4

) .

(20)

fir receives contributions of order  from expanding the free theory result

eq. (7) as well as from interactions. the interaction contribution is easily

obtained from eq. (16) by setting g2

m(t ) and y2(t ) equal to their xed point

20

values at t = 0, eq. (19). we obtain

fir = 15n 2 (1 +  

31
2

) ,

(21)

where the + comes from expanding the free expression whereas the  31

2 

comes from the interactions. thus we see that our inequality fu v  fir is

satised once the interactions are taken into account.

a similar analysis may be used to construct a theory with a non-trivial

uv xed point in which fu v < fir

5. when the number of avors is just

below 3n the electric theory has a weakly coupled xed point. at this xed

point, the theory at the origin of moduli space is in a conformally invariant

phase. at this point the interactions reduce f below its free eld value (cf.

eq. (16)). away from the origin of moduli space the uv behavior of the

theory is still described by this xed point, while in the ir the gauge group

is partially broken and some of the avors become massive. the infrared

theory will either be free or ow to a nonzero xed point smaller than the

uv value. the net dierence fir  fu v will be positive if the number of

avors that have expectation values is not too large.

5.3 qed in d=3

for 2 + 1 dimensional qed (qed3) we will show that the inequality gives an

interesting constraint on the allowed infrared phase structure. qed3 with

2f charged weyl fermions (f dirac fermions) is believed to have a phase

transition as the number of avors is varied [31, 32]. the massless theory has

a u(2f ) global symmetry. for large f , the screening eect of the fermions

prevents the formation of a condensate and the infrared theory is expected to

be conformal. for small f , on the other hand, one expects global symmetry

breaking and dynamical mass generation for the fermions. an analysis of the

breaking using a gap equation indicates that a parity conserving mass term

is formed, corresponding to the breaking of the global u(2f ) symmetry to

its u(f )  u(f ) subgroup.

the inequality places a tight constraint on this pattern of breaking. qed3

is free in the ultraviolet and using eq. (12) we have 6

fu v = 1 +

3
4

4f ,

(22)

where 4f counts the fermionic degrees of freedom. the breaking of the u(2f )

symmetry to u(f )  u(f ) leads to 2f 2 nambu-goldstone bosons. since the

theory does not conne, the photon remains in the infrared spectrum so we

have

fir = 1 + 2f 2 .

(23)

the inequality is satised only for f  3/2 which implies that chiral sym-

metry breaking is excluded for all f  2.

the critical number of avors separating the two phases has been esti-

mated, using the gap equation with a 1/f expansion of the kernel, to be in

the range 3 < fcrit < 4 [31, 32]. the discrepancy between this result and our

inequality suggests that the gap equation over-estimates fcrit.

6in (2 + 1) dimensions free bosons and fermions respectively contribute 1 and 3/4 to f .

6 conclusion

we have proposed a general constraint on the structure of asymptotically

free eld theories, the inequality eq.

(4). although we have not proven

this inequality, we have shown that it agrees with a large number of known

results. in addition it places interesting restrictions on the pattern of sym-

metry breaking in many cases. the inequality (or one similar to it) would

arise as a consequence of a c-theorem in four dimensions, but is a weaker

condition, and can be true even in circumstances where a c-theorem is not.

it nevertheless provides a constraint on the general character of renormaliza-

tion group ows for a wide variety of asymptotically free eld theories with

ir xed points. in specic cases it may be possible to prove the inequality

via the route of section 3. we have noted that the inequality can be vio-

lated for eld theories with non-trivial uv xed points, and have provided

an example of such a theory in section (5.2). the inequality can also be

valid for theories with non-trivial ultraviolet xed points, provided that  is

suciently positive over a large temperature range.

finally, it is interesting to apply the inequality to chiral gauge theories.

in particular, in a model due to bars and yankielowicz [33] in which the

anomaly matching conditions are consistent with the formation of massless

composite fermions, the inequality leads to a nontrivial constraint on the

infrared spectrum. in a future paper [34, in preparation], we will discuss the

application of the inequality to this and several other chiral gauge models.
