abstract

we study the decoupling eects in one-loop corrected n = 1 supersymmetric the-
ory with gauge neutral chiral superelds, by calculating the one-loop corrected eective
lagrangian that involves light and heavy elds with the mass scale m , and subse-
quently eliminating heavy elds by their equations of motion. in addition to new non-
renormalizable couplings, we determine the terms that grow as log m and renormalize
the elds and couplings in the eective eld theory, in accordance with the decoupling
theorem. however, in a theory derived from superstring theory, these terms can sig-
nicantly modify low energy predictions for the eective couplings of light elds. for
example, in a class of heterotic superstring vacua with an anomalous u (1) the vacuum
restabilization introduces such decoupling eects which in turn correct the low energy
predictions for certain couplings by 10-50%.

in principle the decoupling eects of heavy elds in eld theory are well understood.
according to the decoupling theorem [1] (for additional references see, e.g., [2]) in eld
theory of interacting light (with masses m) and heavy elds (with masses m) the heavy
elds decouple; the eective lagrangian of the light elds can be written in terms of the
original classical lagrangian of light elds with the loop eects of heavy elds absorbed into
redenitions of new light elds, masses and couplings, and the only new terms in this eective
lagrangian are non-renormalizable ones, proportional to inverse powers of m (both at tree-
and loop-levels).

when eld theory is an eective description of phenomena at certain energies, the rescal-
ing of the elds and couplings due to the heavy elds does not aect the structure of couplings,
since those are free parameters whose values are determined by experiments. on the other
hand if the eld theory is describing an eective theory of an underlying fundamental theory,
like superstring theory, where the couplings at the string scale are calculable, the decoupling
eects of the heavy eld can be important and can signicantly aect the low energy pre-
dictions for the couplings of light elds at low energies. therefore the quantitative study
of decoupling eects at the loop-level in eective supersymmetric theories is important; it
should improve our understanding of such eects for the eective lagrangians from super-
string theory and provide us with calculable corrections for the low energy predictions of the
theory.

eective theories of n = 1 supersymmetric four-dimensional perturbative superstring
vacua can be obtained by employing techniques of two-dimensional conformal eld theory [3].
in particular the kahlerian and the chiral (super-) potential can be calculated explicitly at the
tree level. (for a representative work on the subject see, e.g., [4, 5], and references therein.) 1
one of the compelling motivations for a detailed study of decoupling eects is the phe-
nomenon of vacuum restabilization [6] for a class of four-dimensional (quasi-realistic) super-
string vacua with an anomalous u(1). for such string vacua of perturbative heterotic string
theory, the fayet-iliopoulos (fi) d- term is generated at genus-one [7], thus triggering cer-
tain elds to acquire vacuum expectation values (vevs) of order mstring  ggaugemp lanck 
1017 gev along d- and f - at directions of the eective n = 1 supersymmetric theory. 2
(here ggauge is the gauge coupling and mp lanck the planck scale.) due to these large string-
scale vevs a number of additional elds obtain large string-scale masses. some of them
in turn couple through (renormalizable) interactions to the remaining light elds, and thus

1while the superpotential terms calculated at the string tree-level are protected from higher genus cor-
rections, the kahlerian potential is not. such higher genus corrections to the kahlerian potential could be
signicant, however, their structure has not been studied very much.

2on the open type i string side these eects are closely related to the blowing-up procedure of type i

orientifolds and were recently studied in [8].

2

through decoupling eects, aect the eective theory of light elds at low energies. (for the
study of the eective lagrangians and their phenomenological implications for a class of such
four-dimensional string vacua see, e.g., [9][10] and references therein.)

the tree level decoupling eects within n = 1 supersymmetric theories, were studied
within superstring theory in [11]. in a related work [12] it was shown that the leading order
corrections of order 1
m are to the eective superpotential, however there are also important
next order eects in the eective superpotential [13]. in addition, in [13] the nonrenormal-
izable modications of the kahler potential (also pointed out in [14]) were systematically
studied. these tree level decoupling eects (as triggered by, e.g., vacuum restabilization for a
class of string vacua) lead to new nonrenormalizable interactions which are competitive with
the nonrenormalizable terms that are calculated directly in the superstring theory.

the main purpose of this paper is to address the one-loop decoupling eects in n = 1
supersymmetric theory. the main motivation for this study is that such eective lagragians
arise naturally as subsectors of an eective theory for a class superstring vacua with an
anomalous u(1); vacuum restabilization triggers couplings between heavy elds with mass
scale m  1017 gev and the light (massless) elds. we specically concentrate on the
eects of chiral (gauge neutral) superelds. (we do not include supergravity eects and soft
supersymmetry breaking eects which could be signicant.) for the sake of simplicity and to
illustrate the eects clearly, we shall consider a specic toy model with only one light and one
heavy chiral supereld and a specic renormalizable form of their interactions. (a systematic
presentation of the derivation of the results and applications to more general models will be
given elsewhere [15].)

the starting point is the eective theory with (gauge neutral) n = 1 chiral superelds

i whose action is of the form:

s[, ] = z d8zk( i, i) + (z d6zw (i) + h.c.) ,

(1)

where i = i(z), za  (xa, ,  ); a = 0, 1, 2, 3;  = 1, 2,
 = 1, 2, d8z = d4xd2d2 . real
function k( i, i) is called kahlerian potential and holomorphic function w (i) is called
chiral potential [16]. we refer to the action (1) as a general chiral supereld model. it is the
most general model constructed from chiral superelds and contains no higher derivatives
at component level. (the model (1) can be interpreted as a subsector of an eective theory
at energy scales   mstring, derived from an underlying fundamental theory superstring
theory; potentials k( i, i), w (i) are calculable in superstring theory.)

we shall investigate the eective lagrangian (1) with the light and heavy chiral super-
elds, with interaction terms that involve both. we shall calculate the one-loop supereld
eective potential and eliminate the heavy superelds by their equations of motion containing

3

one-loop quantum corrections. subsequently we shall study the implications of the obtained
eective action of the light supereld, only.

though the calculations can be carried out with arbitrary functions k( i, i) and w (i)
(again, these generalizations will be given elsewhere [15]) we restrict ourselves for simplicity
to the so called minimal case where

here m is a mass of heavy supereld , the light supereld  is assumed massless. hence
the total classical action is of the form:

(4)

let [, , , ] be the eective action of the model under consideration. in terms of the

expansion in powers of the covariant derivatives the eective action can be written as

[, , , ] = z d8zkef f (, , , ) + (z d6zwef f (, ) + h.c.) + . . . ,

(5)

where the dots denote the terms that depend on covariant derivatives. the functions kef f
and wef f are the kahlerian and chiral eective potential, respectively [16]. one can show
that quantum corrections to wef f begin at two-loops. [16, 17]. thus at the one-loop level the
contributions are restricted to the khlerian potential, only: kef f (, , , ) = k(, , , )+
k (1)(, , , ) where k is the classical kahlerian potential and k (1) is the one-loop quantum
correction.

we follow the following (standard) strategy. we determine the heavy superelds by
solving the their equations of motion in a theory with the one-loop corrected eective action.
the obtained solution for heavy superelds is then inserted into the eective action. the
result is the eective action sef f [, ] of light elds, only 3. (the same procedure for pure
classical theory, i.e., kef f = k has been employed in [13].)

3to be more precise, one should insert the solution for the heavy superelds into equations of motion for
light superelds and then derive the eective action of light elds which would precisely reproduce the latter
equations of motion. we checked that in the case under consideration the result is the same as in the case of
directly substituting the solution for heavy superelds into the original one-loop corrected eective action.

(7)

and an analogous equation for n+1. in principle, these equations allow one to nd the n-th
order corrections n in an explicit form.

we now turn to the calculation of k (1). we employ the technique for the computation of
the supereld eective potential developed in refs.[18]. the one-loop correction (1) to the
eective action can be written as

ei(1)

= z d qdqdqd qeis2[, ,, ;q, q,q, q] ,

(8)

where we split the original superelds into the background ones: , , ,  and the quantum
ones: q, q, q, q, by using the rule    + q,    + q,    + q,    + q. s2
is a part of the classical action quadratic in the quantum superelds. the path integral (8)
is taken over the chiral superelds. it can be transformed into a path integral over general
superelds u, v (for details, see refs. [16, 18]):

in order to cancel the divergencies in the eective action (8) we add to the initial action (4)

potential kef f .

ct = 1

since we are interested only in the kahlerian eective potential we can set all the back-
ground superelds to be constant. then one can use the supereld proper-time technique
[16, 18] and obtain the following form of the one-loop correction to the kaherian potential:

k (1) =

(14)

this is the focal result of the paper. as a result, the low-energy eective action with one-loop
quantum corrections has the form

where k (1) is given by eq. (11). in order to keep track of the one-loop (quantum) eects,
here and in the following we display explicitly the planck constant h.

we now solve the equations of motion for heavy superelds with the one-loop corrected
eective action obtained above. as explained earlier, we solve eqs. (6)-(7) via an iterative
method. in the leading order, one obtains

(18)

eqs. (16)-(18) are our nal technical results, which are in agreement with the decoupling
theorem. namely, the heavy superelds at the zeroth-order in 1
m expansion decouple from
the eective theory; the eective action of light superelds at the zeroth order is described by
the lagrangian where all the eects of the heavy superelds are contained in the redenition
(rescaling) of the parameters of the model, i.e., elds, masses, and couplings [1, 2].
in
particular, let us rescale the light supereld  in eq. (17) as  = z 1/2, where z = 1 
322 42(1 + log 2m 2
2 ) , in order to transform the kinetic energy term to a canonical form. we
also rescale the coupling g as g = z 3/2g. after these transformations the eective action of
light superelds indeed takes the form

i.e., this is the one-loop corrected eective action of the light elds that one would have
obtained within the theory of light elds, only. let us also point out that the logarithmic
term of the form in eq. (19) is due to the quantum corrections of the self-interaction term
( g) of light superelds, only; this is the well-known coleman-weinberg one-loop correction
to the eective potential due to light superelds, only.

we turn to the interpretation and to determine the implications of the one-loop eective
action (16)  (18) when the eective eld theory is derived from a fundamental theory, like
superstring theory where the original couplings are calculable. in this case the rescaling of
the elds and the couplings, performed above, has important implications for the quantitative
predictions for the eective couplings at low energies.

let us further illustrate the signicance of these eects by imposing the renormalization
condition log 2m 2
2 = 1 in order to cancel a term proportional to 2 in the zeroth-order of
1
m expansion, i.e., this renormalization condition eliminates in the eective action the eect
of a term responsible for the interaction between the heavy and light superelds. one then
arrives at the eective action

(here e = exp(1)). note that the eect of the quantum corrections in the above action grows

thus, reconrming that the decoupling eects can be signicant.

alternatively, we can keep  free, and the the eective theory (16)  (18) can be viewed
as specied at low energies   m. again, the obtained eective action (17) has quantum
corrections that are proportional to log 2m 2
 
.

2 , i.e., these corrections grow as log m

 when m

within superstring theory the above corrections can now have sizable calculable predic-
tions for the low energy couplings. let us illustrate the eect within a class of perturbative

8

heterotic string models with an anomalous u(1); after the vacuum restabilization there are
in general renormalizable interactions between the light and heavy elds, with the mass of
order m  mstring  1017 gev . the one-loop decoupling eects can signicantly change the
low energy predictions for the couplings at the electro-weak scale (  1 tev). for example,
in a class of string models discussed in, [9][10], typical values of the couplings, calculated
at mstring, are  = g = ggauge. here ggauge  0.8 is the value of the gauge coupling at at
mstring. renormalization group equations then determine the values of  and g couplings
at low energies . (for elds charged under the non-abelian gauge group factors such large
tri-linear couplings are driven to the infrared xed points governed by the infrared values of
the non-abelian gauge couplings.) due to the above one-loop decoupling eects there is now
also an additional correction to the eective tri-linear coupling g for the light elds; it is of
the order of ()2
2  0.26. (we used the typical values m  mstring  1017 gev,   1
tev and ()  0.8.) this specic example illustrates that due to the one-loop decoupling
eects, the actual predictions for the tri-linear couplings at low energies could be corrected
by 10  50%!
