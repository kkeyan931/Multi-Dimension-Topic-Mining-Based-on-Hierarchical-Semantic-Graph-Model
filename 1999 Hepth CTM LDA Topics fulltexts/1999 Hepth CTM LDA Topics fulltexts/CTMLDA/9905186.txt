(2.7) equation implicitly denes greens function, due abundance type things literature call transfer function. thus, z b generic coordinates bulk, respectively boundary. hence g(z, b)oi(b) = i(z), zboundary (2.8) 2z2 0 d3k ei(t )+ik(zx) 2 k2 (2)4 rez>|k| g(z, z0, t, x, ) = j (z0p2 k2). (2.9) see eliminated modes < |k|, transfer function proportional function z0 0. thus, dierent analytical continuation greens function obtained {$9802150$}. also, see, reason ! 2 lack manifest causality. finding g explicitly hard, bit messy. rst perform angular part integral, choosing z x x main axis. thus, k(z x) = kx cos , 0 < < /2, < k < . choice range k bit unusual, makes computation easier. thus, g = 2+2z2 0 (2)4 rez>|k| dz dk k ix eit+ikx j (z02 k2) (2 k2) . (2.10) substituting k = sinh y, = cosh obtain steps g = 2+2z2 0 (2)4 z 0 da a2 j(az0) rez dy sinh ix eia(t cosh y+x sinh y). (2.11) second integral evaluated dierently x > > x. present rst case only. second one obtained analytic continuation. substituting x = x2 t2 cosh s, = x2 t2 sinh s, l = + second integral becomes steps: rez dy sinh ix eia(t cosh y+x sinh y) = = dl sinh l sin(apx2 t2 sinh l) k1(apx2 t2). (2.12) 2 x2 t2 z x2 t2 2 0 3 thus g = 2+3z2 0 (2)4x2 t2 z 0 da a2j (az0)k1(apx2 t2). (2.13) case > x, k1 simply becomes h1. here, j, n, h k denote appropriate bessel functions. integral hard perform. using  (6.576 3) obtain g = z2+ 0 (x2 t2)23( + 1) f 2, 1; + 1, 0 x2 t2! . z2 (2.14) well known, hypergeometric function poles 0, 1 , analytically continued inside light cone. obtained transfer function look causal. limit bulk coordinate goes boundary proportional function. thus, need know boundary eld poincare patch order obtain bulk eld point. contradicts intuition excitation boundary propagate causally bulk. see obtain causal looking transfer function working universal cover ads. case, regard poincare patch boundary operators one back light cone bulk point, thus manifest causality. 3 locality bulk - conformal case order check locality bulk elds dened (2.7), need nd commu- tator itself, time derivative. one attempt checking locality would use (2.14), computation hard, obscures physics going on. intuitive go small steps. thus, would like nd commutators   boundary theory, combine (2.7) order obtain commutator eld time derivative. this, rst nd . done two ways: analytically continuing euclidean case, using kallen-lehmann representation. know properly normalized os, euclidean case, ho(x, ), o(0, 0)i = 1 (x2 + 2) , (3.1) dimension operator o. obtain time ordered anti time ordered correlation functions analytically continuing poles = x = x. > 0,  = ht o(x, t)o(0, 0)i ha o(x, t)o(0, 0)i. 4 thus  = 2i sin()(t2 x2)sgn(t) . (3.2) (t2 x2) formula may look bit puzzling integer dimension operators, nevertheless, tells us commutator nonzero light cone. also note free eld mass m, h(x, ), (0, 0)ie = k1(mx2 + 2) x2 + 2 , m = ij1(mt2 x2) t2 x2 (t2 x2)sgn(t), (3.3a) (3.3b) labels e stand euclidean minkovskian. use kallen- lehmann representation: ho(x, ), o(0, 0)ie = z m = z 0 0 dm2 f (m2) h(x, ), (0, 0)ie, dm2 f (m2) m , (3.4a) (3.4b) extract f (m2) (3.4a) (3.1), plug back (3.4b) reobtain (3.2). integral kallen-lehmann representation runs 0, mass scale conformal theory. since dened ok, correspond positive frequency, easily see  = 0, since commutator contains ( + ). true os. looking poincare invariance boundary theory, quite easy see commutator  contain ( )(k k). since theory conformal, product functions must multiplied appropriate power 2 k2. also compute  using brute force. combining (2.2) (3.2) straightforward, steps use techniques similar ones pag. 2, obtain:  = (2 k2)2( )(k k)c, (3.5) c numerical constant ( 3 225()(1) curious reader). understand (v) d-dimensional vector v appropriate d-dimensional function. using (3.5) (2.7) show bulk elds local. three things check: 1 -  = 0, 2 -  (z0 z0)(z z) 5 3 -  = 0 outside light cone. fact, condition 3 follow 2, symmetry bulk, nice show works out. x without loss generality z 0. using (2.7) (3.5)  z2 0z2  z2 0z>|k| d3k j (z0p2 k2)j (z0p2 k2)(eikz eikz) 0. 0z>|k| d3k j(z0p2 k2)j (z0p2 k2) cos(t + kz). 0z2 (3.6) (3.7) using change variable evaluation (2.9), obtain  0z2 z2 0 z z 0 da a3j (az0)j (az0)imz dy sinh cosh eia(z sinh y+t cosh y). (3.8) = 0, easier use (3.7), replace da. integrals d3k da separate, d3k integral gives us (z). left  z2 0z2 0 (z)z 0 da aj(az0)j(az0). (3.9a) integral proportional (z0 z0), orthogonality relation bessel functions. thus, checked second relation. keep constants along way sake clarity. exact answer is:  = z3 0(z0 z0)(z) 22i ()( 1) (3.9b) order check third relation look range in. z > t, make substitution (2.10): z = z2 t2 cosh s, = z2 t2 sinh s, (3.7) obtain making change variable: imz dy sinh cosh eia(sinh yz+cosh yt) = cosh 2sz z2 t2 (a). cosh 2s = dy sinh cosh sin(apz2 t2 sinh y) (3.10) clearly commutator vanishes range, high power (3.8). z = t, extra term form 1 a2 last line (3.10) . original term vanish high power (3.8), extra term also vanish z0 6= z0, orthogonality relation bessel functions. (z2t2) z2t2 6 > z, substitute = t2 z2 cosh s, z = t2 z2 sinh s, get imz dy sinh cosh eia(z sinh y+t cosh y) = sinh 2sz j2(apt2 z2). dy cosh 2y sin(apt2 z2 sinh y) thus  0z2 z2 0 z z 0 da a3j (az0)j (az0)j2(apt2 z2). (3.11) (3.12) using (6.578-8), remembering j2(x) = j2(x), see integral vanishes |z0 z0| > t2 z2, e.g. outside light cone, expected. 4 non conformal case look near horizon metric dilaton collection n dp branes, general p: ds2 p = " u (7p)/2 gy n 1/2 dx2 gy n 1/2!(p3)/2 u (7p)/2 k + e = g2 . gy n 1/2 u (7p)/2 (du 2 + u 2d2 8p)#, (4.1) gy coupling constant theory brane. supergravity valid description bulk theory range dilaton scalar curvature small. case d2 branes, explore later, g2 n 1/5 < u < g2 n . general analysis cases found {$9802042$}. look limit gy n bulk. massless scalar eld minimally coupled einstein metric, s8p angular momentum quantum number l, frequency momentum k satises classical equation motion: (u ) + 8 p u (u ) + m2 u 2 + g2 n (2 k2) u (7p) !

(4.3) 7 expect construction work nonconformal cases, since conjecture  hilbert spaces same. nevertheless, illustrate case d2 brane. machinery similar one crank conformal case. thus, bulk scalar angular momentum l, euclidean correlator corresponding boundary operators : ho(x, ), o(0, 0)i = b (x2 + 2) , b n (5+2l)/3 (g2 )(l+1)/3 (19 + 4l)/6. quite clearly,  = b(2 k2)3/2( )(k k), (4.4) (4.4) b b factor order unity, curious reader compute way previous chapter. bulk eld satisfying correspondent (2.6), z understood 2 dimensional vector is: i(t, z, z0) = z5/2 0 (2/3gy n 1/2) (2)3/2 z>k d2k eit+ikzaj ( 2 3 gy n 1/2az 0 )oi k, + h.c., 3 2 2 k2. simplifying formulas, call g 2 (4.5) 3 gy n 1/2. three things check conformal case. rst one follows exactly like conformal case. second one involves calculating  (z0z0)5/2g2 b rez>|k| (4.6) easily angular integral, using d2k = k dk d, 0 < k < , 0 < < . that, make substitution k = sinh y, = cosh obtain d2k j (gaz 0 )eit+ikz. 0 )j (gaz 3 2 3 2  (z0z0)5/2g2 bz 0 da a3j (gaz0 3 2 )j (gaz 3 2 0 ) z 0 sinh cosh yj0(a sinh yz) cos(a cosh yt). (4.7) call second integral i. using  (6.738 2), see vanishes z > t, expected. equal time case, = 0, (az) az ,  (z)(z0 z0), (z0 z0) came orthogonality relation bessel functions applied (4.7). (at2 x2). thus 2 +1j(gaz0 z < t, (t2z2)(3/4) a1/2j 3 (z0z0)5/2|t| (t2 z2)(3/4) g2 bz (apt2 x2).  3 2 )j (gaz 0 )j 3 da (4.8) |t| 3 2 3 2 0 2 8 integral vanishes gz0 means outside light cone bulk theory, look metric (4.1) see 0 > t2 x2 (6-578, 5 8). see indeed 2 gz 3 2 3 dierential from, null trajectory: dt = dz0 z gz0 0 = t. therefore, constructed local elds bulk. possible turn argument around, argue order bulk local theory, boundary 2 gz 0 gy n 1 2 , exactly dierential 1 2 3 3 2 operators satisfy relation similar (4.6). 5 interactions constructed local elds leading order 1/n . true locality ultimately broken bulk, holography, believe nonperturbative eect. thus possible principle construct bulk local elds perturbatively 1/n . so, ask question: repeat bdhm-bklt construction interacting cases ? next leading order 1/n , boundary theory longer looks like free theory. rather, 6= j (3.1) replaced by: oi(xi)oj(xj) = 1 n xk z ddxqijk(x|x1, x2)ok(x), qijk(x|x1, x2) obtained boundary 3-point function. also, bulk theory extra terms lagrangian, form lint = dijkijk. (5.1) (5.2) expect (2.6) valid interacting case well. practical way check locality next leading order 1/n use interacting bulk equations motion boundary free operators, compare result one obtained using free bulk equation motion boundary interacting theory. 1/n contributions cancel outside light cone, bulk elds local. nevertheless, computation hard. tried compute commutator bulk elds using boundary interacting theory free equations motion, technical diculties big us. said introduction, cannot hope reader audacity technical inclinations might bring completion. 9 6 conclusions two new results paper. rst one computation transfer function relating boundary operators bulk elds, context ads-cft correspondence. second one expansion bdhm-bklt procedure nonconformal cases. presented method constructing bulk elds near-horizon geometry col- lection dp branes, veried locality explicitly d2 brane case. acknowledgments: would like thank specially prof. joseph polchinski help guidance project. grateful vijay balasubramanian, dorin bena, gary horowitz, daniel z. freedman albion lawrence useful conversations, aki hashimoto nisan itzhaki allowing use unpublished results. work supported part nsf grant phy97-22022. 10
