abstract

the n = 1 self-dual supergravity has sl(2, c) symmetry . this symme-

try results in su(2) charges as the angular-momentum. as in the non-

supersymmetric self-dual gravity, the currents are also of their potentials

and are therefore identically conserved. the charges are generally invari-

ant and gauge covariant under local su(2) transforms approaching to be

rigid at spatial innity. the poisson brackets constitute su(2) algebra and

hence can be interpreted as the generally covariant conservative angular-

momentum.

inary part. the original ashtekars self-dual canonical gravity permits also a lagrangian

formulation[3] [4]. the supersymmetric extension of this lagrangian formulation, which

is equivalent to the simple real supergravity, was proposed by jacobson[5], and the cor-

responding ashtekar complex canonical transform was given by gorobey et al[6]. the

lagrangian density is[5]

the dynamical variables are the real tetrad eaa (the real means eaa = eaa), the

traceless left-handed sl(2.c) connection am n and the complex anticommuting spin- 3

the indices are lowered and raised with the antisymmetric sl(2, c) spinor ab and its

inverse ab according to the convention b = aab, a = abb, and the implied

summations are always in north-westerly fashion: from the left-upper to the right-lower.

the lagrangian eq.(1) is a holomorphic functions of the connection and the equation for

the 0-components e0aa, 0a, 0a and a0ab are just the lagrange multipliers and the

all other brackets among these quantities being zero. this is the outline of the theory.

in our previous works, we have obtained the su(2) charges and the energy-momentum

su(2) charge, self-dual supergravity

in the ashtekars formulation of einstein gravity[7]-[8] and they are closely related to the

angular-momentum[9]-[11] and the energy-momentum [12] in the vierbein formalism of

einstein gravity. the fact that the algebra formed by their poisson brackets do constitute

the 3-poincare algebra on the cauchy surface supports from another aspect that their

denitions are reasonable. similarly, the study of su(2) charges in the self-dual super-

gravity considered is also an interesting subject.

in the following, we will employ the

sl(2, c) invariance to obtain the conservative charges as we did previously[8] under any

sl(2, c) transform

lj is invariant. l and r may not neccessarily related by complex conjugation. note that
lab = (l1)ba, the transform of a may also be written as

(21)

when calculating the variation of the lagrangian, one must take into consideration of the

anticommuting feature of the gravitino eld. we write the variation in the way that

lj = a(


a  



a )lj + (a



alj)

where a denotes any eld involved in the rst order lagrangian. now both 

a and

(22)



a

are (anti-)commuting if a is (anti-)commuting, and so there is no ordering problem.

the invariance of lj under the innitesimal sl(2, c) transform is equivalent to the

following modulo the eld equations

which is exactly the same as eq.(30) we can thus have the poisson brackets

now the at dreibein on  is needed in order to nd the angular- momentum ji. to

clarify the notions, we use the following conventions: , , ... denote the 4-dim curved

indices and i, j, k, denote the 3-dim curved indices on ; a, b, c, ... denote the at 4-dim

indices and l, m, n, ... denote the at 3-dim indices on . the rigid at vierbein is denoted

as ea

aa and the rigid at dreibein is denoted by em

ab. then dene

and using the relation mnlemen = 2el we have

jm :=

{jm, jn} = mnlj l

(36)

(37)

therefore the su(2) algebra is restored. as in the non-supersymmetric case[8], we can also

obtain only the su(2) charges instead of the whole sl(2, c) charges. yet, the angualr-

momentum jab obtained in[9]-[10] is completely contained in jm n since we have from

eq(32) that

where j

ab is the angular -momentum current obtained in [9]-[10].

and the angualr-momentum is

hence

therefore

(42)

su(2) charge, self-dual supergravity

bear in mind that both 1

2(li + iki) obey the su(2) algbra[13]. actually,
the boost charges are vanishing as can be seen from eq(30). thus we can obtain the

2 (li  iki) and 1

angualr-momentum, in the self-dual simple supergravity once jm n is known.

we make a few remarks nally. the total charges take the same integral form as those

in the non-supersymmetric case. though we can obtain the su(2) sector of the sl(2, c)

charges, the information of the angular-momentum is completely contained in the su(2)

charges. it can be seen from the surface integrals that the angular-momentum is governed

by the r2 part of ei. as in [1]-[2], we always assume that the phase space variables are

subject to the boundary conditions.

i.e., they gauge covariant. their conservation is generally covariant. as in the non-

supersymmetric case[7]-[8] , the currents have also potentials, i.e., can be expressed as a

divergence of a antisymmetric tensor density. so they are identically conserved. upon

quantization, the poisson brackets correspond to the quantal commutators and their al-

gebra realizes indeed the su(2) algebra. this shows that their interpertations reasonable.
it is novel that the relation between jm n and the constraint j ab is the same as that

between the electric charge and the gauss law constraint in qed[14]

  e  e 0 = 0
q = z

e  ds

(47)

(48)

so the jm n is a kind of gauge charge.
