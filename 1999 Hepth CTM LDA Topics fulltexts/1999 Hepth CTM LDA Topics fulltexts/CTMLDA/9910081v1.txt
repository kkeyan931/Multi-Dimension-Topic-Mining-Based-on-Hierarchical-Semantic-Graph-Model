abstract

we propose a supergravity derivation of the randallsundrum action as an eective
description of the dynamics of a brane coupled to the bulk through gravity only. the
cosmological constants in the bulk and on the brane, which appear at the classical level
when solving the supergravity equations of motion, are related to physical quantities
like the brane electric charge and thus inherit some of their physical properties. the
most appealing property is their quantization: in d extra dimensions, brane goes like
1/n and bulk like n 2/(d2). this supergravity origin also explains the apparent ne-
tuning required in the randallsundrum scenario. in our approach, the cosmological
constants are derived parameters and cannot be chosen arbitrarily; instead they are
determined by the underlying supersymmetric lagrangian. d3-branes of type iib
superstring theory provide an explicit realization of our construction.

1 introduction

the coexistence of two hierarchical scales in particle physics is probably the most chal-
lenging puzzle to solve before hoping to construct a quantum theory of gravity. when the
schwarzchild radius (rsch = 2gn m/c2) of a system of mass m becomes of the same order as its
compton length (c = /mc), a quantum mechanical extension of general relativity is surely
needed. therefore the natural scale of quantum gravity is the planck mass,pc5/gn  1019

gev. understanding how, in such a theory, the tiny electroweak scale observed in experi-
mental particle physics can arise and be stabilized against radiative corrections constitutes
the so-called gauge hierarchy problem. in low energy supersymmetry [1], this vast disparity
in scales can be protected from quantum destabilization. however a more fundamental ex-
planation is certainly to be found in string theory and its latest developments. string theory
relates the string scale to two other fundamental scales, namely the gut scale connected
to gauge interactions, and the planck scale connected to the gravitational interaction. the
link between these two is the geometry of extra dimensions, which can lower both scales [2]
down to the tev range [3] and thus partially answer the gauge hierarchy problem, or at least
translate it into geometrical terms.

may be following the legacy of studies of thin shells in general relativity [4, 5], recently
randall and sundrum (rs) have proposed [6] a new phenomenological mechanism for solving
the gauge hierarchy problem, without requiring the extra dimension to be particularly large
or smallin fact be noncompact. an exponential hierarchy is generated by the localization
of gravity near a self-gravitating brane with positive tension, obtained by solving einstein
equations. the solution is a nonfactorizable metric, i.e., a metric with an exponentially
decaying warp factor [7] along the single extra dimension. restricting the standard model
to a second parallel brane with negative tension at some distance in this transverse dimension,
the electroweak scale in our world then follows from a redshifting of the planck scale on the
second brane. since the exponential suppression by the redshift factor does not require an
unnaturally large interbrane separation, the hierarchy problem can be explained without ne
tuning, and without requiring any special size for the extra dimensions.

the cosmological implications of this scenario have been studied [8, 9], with emphasis on
the danger of placing the standard model on a brane with negative tension since, for instance,
the friedmann equation governing the expansion of the universe appears with a wrong sign.
a similar diculty is also faced [10] when trying to reproduce the unication of gauge
couplings. the original scenario can be modied [6,10,11] by maximizing the warp factor on
the standard model brane, which can be achieved if its tension is taken positive. the two
former problems are overcome but the electroweak scale seems now dicult to accommodate.
thus the rs scenario remains attractive, especially with regard to the possibility of an innite
extra dimension probed only by gravity. it is appealing that, despite a continuous kaluza
klein spectrum without any mass gap, newtons law of gravity is still reproduced [6, 1113]
within the current experimental precision.

although the gravity localization mechanism seems to be specic to codimension one
brane, several works [12, 14] have managed to extend it by considering many intersecting

1

codimension one branes.1 oda and hatanaka et al. [16] also obtain solutions with a more in-
volved content of branes with a single one extra-dimension. in this context also, cosmological
expansion can be reconciled with the solution to the weak scale hierarchy problem [17].

undoubtedly, the localization of gravity by the rs mechanism has rich phenomenological
and cosmological consequences [812,1620]; but at the present stage it seems lacking in gen-
erality, and it suers from apparently ad hoc ne-tunings required between the cosmological
constants in the bulk and on the branes, in order to obtain a solution to einstein equations.
verlinde [21] has reexamined the rs scenario in superstring language and shown that the
warp factor can be interpreted as a renormalization group scaling.
in the context of the
ads/cft correspondence, the extra dimension plays the role of the energy scale.

in this paper, we oer a derivation of the eective action used by rs, starting from a
more fundamental, string-inspired origin. recent works [5, 2224] have studied the dynam-
ics of a supersymmetric brane-universe; here we propose an explicit embedding of the rs
model in supergravity theories and examine its physical implications. our starting point
will be the bosonic action of supergravity theories in ten or eleven dimensions. we empha-
size that, instead of neglecting various elds specic to these actions like the dilaton and
some n-dierential forms, taking them into account can lead to an eective description in
terms of cosmological constants. using p-brane solutions, we construct such a description
for codimension one branes, which allows us to identify the eective cosmological constants
with physical quantities like the electric charge carried by the brane and its mass density on
the worldvolume. since the electric charge of a p-brane obeys a generalized dirac quantiza-
tion rule, we are led to the interesting conclusion that the cosmological constants are also
quantized.

the advantage of this approach is that we derive the stress-energy tensor t, which is
needed to solve the einstein equations, starting from an action for fundamental elds, rather
than putting it in by hand. thus our t is on the same footing as the einstein tensor itself,
from the point of view of fundamentality, since it follows from a symmetry principle: namely,
supersymmetry xes the form or t and constrains the values of the couplings appearing
therein. moreover we are able to generalize the procedure to higher codimension brane-
universes (e.g., 3-branes embedded in more than one extra dimension), providing some of
the rst such solutions. in this case the bulk energy is no longer a cosmological constant,
but depends on the distance from the brane.

2 brane cosmological constant as a warp in an anti-de

sitter bulk

we begin with a review of the model studied by randall and sundrum [6]. consider a static
brane embedded in a spacetime curved by a bulk cosmological constant b. the physics of

this model is governed by the following action:

srs =z dp+1x ddyp|g| (cid:18) r

22  b  d(p|g| y)(cid:19) ,

(1)

where yi = 0 is the location of the brane in the transverse (extra dimensional) subspace
and g is the determinant of the metric, assumed to be factorizable, in this subspace. the
einstein equations derived from (1) when the transverse space is at are (greek indices
denote longitudinal coordinates,  = 0 . . . p  1 and latin indices are coordinates transverse
to the brane, i = 1 . . . d):

g = 2(cid:16)b + d(p|g| y)(cid:17) g ;
gij = 2b gij .

randall and sundrum solved these equations in the case of a codimension one brane. with
the ansatz

where f is a regular function and the constant n is related to the brane cosmological constant

by:
will play an important role in our analysis corresponds to:

a(y) = (l + |y|/r)na

and

b(y) =

nan r1
l + |y|/r

,

(9)

where r and l are two positive constants. an appropriate change of coordinates brings
this solution to the form proposed by randall and sundrum [6]: dening x  = lnax and
y = sgn(y)nan ln(1 + |y|/(rl)), the metric reads:

ds2 = e2 sgn(na)|y /n | dx 2 + dy 2 .

if the brane located at the origin is identied as the planck brane of lykkenrandall
[11], an electroweak scale will be generated on the tev brane if and only if the power
na is negative, which corresponds to a positive cosmological constant on the planck brane.2
another motivation for requiring na < 0 comes from computing the four-dimensional eective
planck mass, m 2

p l = m 3r dy a2|b|, which is nite for na < 0 but diverges for na > 0.

we can make another dieomorphism that claries the geometry of the solution. dening

r = r0(l + |y|/r)na, with r0 = |n r|, we now obtain:
r (cid:19)2
dx2 +(cid:18) r0

r0(cid:19)2
ds2 =(cid:18) r

dr2 ,

(11)

where we see that the geometry of the bulk corresponds to an anti-de sitter space of radius
r0, or at least a slice of an anti-de sitter space, since the variable r ranges only over a part
of r. indeed, for na > 0, the range of variation of r is restricted to [lna, +), while for
na < 0 this range becomes [0, lna]. although in both cases the whole ads space is covered
in the limit l  0, it is interesting to note which part is cut when l 6= 0. as we will
argue in the appendix, the boundary of an anti-de sitter space of dimension p + 2 space is
topologically s1  sp, and in the system of coordinates x and r, this boundary is located
at r = 0 and r = : the piece at innity is a p + 1-dimensional minkowskian space, while
the horizon at r = 0 corresponds to the union of a point and r  sp. so the na < 0 case,
which corresponds to a positive cosmological constant  on the brane, removes the part at
innity, while the na > 0 case, i.e.  < 0, cuts the horizon at the origin. note that in the
ads/cft correspondence [25], a superconformal theory describes the dynamics of a brane
near the horizon of an ads space while this dynamics should become free near innity [26].

figure 1. the boundary of an anti-de sitter of dimension p + 2 space is topologically s1  sp. in
the system of coordinates x and r, this boundary is located at r = 0 and r = : the piece at
2this connection between the signs of na and  is specic to one transverse dimension. in section 4, we
will see that we can have na > 0 whereas  > 0. in any case, the discussion about the hierarchy problem
deals with the sign of na only.

innity is a p + 1-dimensional minkowskian space, while the horizon at r = 0 corresponds to the
union of a point and r sp. a codimension one brane embedded in this ads space acts as a warp
in the sense that it cuts a part of the bulk: a brane with a positive cosmological constant cuts the
vicinity of the boundary located at the innity, while a brane with a negative cosmological constant
removes the horizon at the origin.

as presented, the model studied by randall and sundrum leaves one wondering whether
it can be derived from some more fundamental starting point.
in particular, the ad hoc
ne-tuning between the cosmological constants is rather mysterious and begs for a better
understanding. one suggestion is that this relation might arise from the requirement that
tadpole amplitudes are zero in the underlying string theory [9]. (see also ref. [27] for recent
progress in this direction). here we will see the cosmological constants as eective parameters
and they cannot be chosen arbitrarily so the ne-tuning problem is dierently formulated.
the aim of this work is to motivate the rs model from a supersymmetry/superstring frame-
work.

3 eective cosmological constants from dynamics of

codimension one branes

in this section, we would like to show that the theory derived from the action (1) can be
seen as an eective description of a brane of codimension one, i.e., of an extended object
with p spatial dimensions embedded in a (p + 2) dimensional spacetime.

the dynamics of an object extended in p spatial directions is governed by the general-

ization of the nambugoto action3 [28]:

b g(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where x (a) are the coordinates in the embedding spacetime of a point on the brane
characterized by its worldvolume coordinates a; mb is the scale mass in so-called p-brane
units which is simply related to the planck scale, m, in the embedding spacetime; see below
eq. (16). this action is known [29] to be equivalent to:

sp = m p+1

where ab is an auxiliary eld that gives the metric on the worldvolume.

(13)

superbranes have been constructed [30] as classical solutions of supergravity theories in
ten or eleven dimensions: they are bps objects, since they preserve half of the supersymme-
tries; they have a poincare invariance on their worldvolume universe and also a rotational

invariance in the transverse space. a p-brane is therefore coupled to the low-energy eective
theory of superstrings. below the fundamental energy scale, identied as the energy of the
rst massive excitations of the string, the theory can be described by supergravity theories
whose bosonic spectrum contains the metric, a scalar eld (the dilaton) and numerous dif-
ferential forms. the bosonic eective action, in supergravity units, takes the general form
(2 = m 2d):

(p + 2)!

epf1...p+2f 1...p+2(cid:19) ,

(14)

where f1...p+2 = (p + 2) [1 a2...p+2] is the eld strength of the (p + 1)-dierential form
a, whose coupling to the dilaton is measured by the coecient p. the coecient p is
explicitly determined by a string computation: the coupling of the dilaton to dierential
forms from the ramond-ramond sector appears at one loop and thus rr
p = (3  p)/2 in
supergravity units, while the neveu-schwarzneveu-schwarz two-form couples at tree level,
so n s
1 = 1. in some cases, we can also add a chernsimons term (a  f  f ) to the
action, but it does not have any eect on the classical solutions.
the p-brane couples to a (p + 1)-dierential form, which results in the addition of a

wesszumino term to the free action (13):

(15)

the functions g and ep implicitly depend on worldvolume coordinates  through their
dependence in the embedding coordinates x. the coecient p denes the p-brane units;
it is xed [31] by requiring the same scaling behavior for sef f and sp , which leads to

p = 

p

p + 1

.

(16)

the relation between mb and m then follows from the value of this coupling to the dilaton:
mb = e/(p+1)m,  being the vacuum expectation value of the dilaton.

to proceed, we must now relax some of the constraints imposed by supersymmetry,
while still maintaining the form of the action. for example in string theories, the values of
p and d are related to one another in order to have supersymmetry on the worldvolume
universe [32]. also, as just mentioned, the coupling to the dilaton is xed. by relaxing these
constraints, we give up any claim that the following construction is a direct consequence of
string theory. on the other hand it might be hoped that our results will persist in a realistic
low energy limit of string theory, which includes the eects of supersymmetry breaking.
in what follows, we will elucidate how the various elds, which play a crucial role for the
existence of branes in supergravity, can give rise to an eective stress-energy tensor which
resembles the cosmological constant terms needed for the randallsundrum scenario.

we will solve these equations in the case of a codimension one brane and we will see in
the next section how the analysis can be extended to higher codimension. first we choose a
system of spacetime coordinates related to the brane:

worldvolume coordinates: x
transverse coordinate:

y ,

 = 0 . . . p ;

in the physical gauge where x () = .

we are looking for a solution with a poincare invariance in (p + 1) dimensions, so that

we can make the following ansatz for the metric:

it is well known that (see for instance [31] for a review), corresponding to the ansatz

w zm p+1e/2 |y| .

we have normalized h(y) so as to obtain a at minkowski space in the vicinity of the brane.
at this stage, it is worth noticing that the derivation follows directly from the bosonic
equations (17-21) and no supersymmetric argument has been used. when the coupling of
the dierential form to the dilaton takes its stringy value, the full supergravity equation
also includes a killing spinor equation that is solved by the solution obtained here, which
promotes the bosonic solution to a bps one.

it is interesting to substitute this solution back into the einstein equations (17) to obtain:

in the limit of decoupling between the brane and the dilaton, i.e.,  = 0, which also corre-
sponds to ny = (p + 1)nx = 1 using the constraint (31), the einstein tensor involves two

8p

they can be interpreted as eective cosmological constants since the metric (27) is a solution
to the einstein equations derived from the rs action (1).

the expression of the cosmological constants in terms of supergravity quantities may give
some insight into the origin of the apparently ad hoc ne-tuning (7) of the rs mechanism:
here the cosmological constants are no longer fundamental parameters and the ne-tuning
problem is not formulated in the same way, in the present language it is a consequence
of taking the limit where the dilaton decouples from the brane. of course this represents
just one point in the full parameter space. the more general solution, when the dilaton
does not decouple, is a bulk energy density which depends on y, rather than a cosmological
constant term. regardless of this dierence, one can still obtain an exponentially decaying
warp factor, as long as nx remains negative. the new insight, then, is that the original rs
solution is only the simplest possibility within a whole class of solutions which can solve the
hierarchy problem.

furthermore, our approach links the energy densities of the brane and bulk to physical
quantities like the charge associated to the electric current (23). not only is such a charge
conserved, but it also obeys diracs quantization rule [33]: solutions exist where the ducial
value of the electric charge is multiplied by an integer and these can be interpreted as a
superposition of n parallel branes. since in such a conguration the electric eld strength
is multiplied by a factor n, the rs eective cosmological constants depend on n:  goes
like /n and b like 
b/n 2. therefore the eective cosmological constants are quantized.
a serious shortcoming with the above solution is that, the dilaton decoupling regime
requires a purely imaginary wesszumino term (see eq. (31)), which implies an imaginary
hence unphysical value for the electric charge. therefore this solution is still just a tantalizing
hint at a stringy origin for the rs proposal. to be more convincing, it is essential to
overcome this problem. in the next section, we will address this issue by going to a higher
number of extra dimensions, in the space transverse to the brane. it may happen that the
compactication of some of these extra dimensions can be crucial, requiring a more complete
analysis involving some interacting moduli elds in gauged supergravity theories4.

4this question has been recently addressed by behrndt and cvetic [24]. see also ref. [22] for an earlier

discussion.

when the dilaton coupling is turned on, the cosmological constant in the bulk will now
have a dependence on the transverse distance r. apart from the shortcoming of not quite
reproducing the rs picture, this solution does have an interesting feature regarding the
cosmological constant on the brane in the physical region where the wess-zumino coupling
aw z is real:
it provides an example of a negative tension brane. for nx > 0, as is the
case when a2
w z > 0, the discontinuity in the derivative of the warp factor is positive, which
through the einstein equation (5) implies that  < 0. this is noteworthy because negative
tension branes play a prominent role in the rs solution.
in the original proposal, which
resembles the horava-witten compactication of d = 11 supergravity, the tev brane was
required to have negative tension. to get correct cosmological expansion on the tev brane
in the case where the extra dimension is noncompact, it was shown [17] that negative tension
branes must exist. since this situation seems rather exotic, it is reassuring to nd a model
in which it arises.

in summary, our study of codimension one branes suggests that the cosmological con-
stants introduced by randall and sundrum are an eective description of the dynamics of
a more complicated set of elds governing the physics of a brane that couples to the bulk
through gravitational interactions only. thus those eective cosmological constants inherit
some physical properties of the brane, an intriguing one being their quantization. we point
out that the solution (27) belongs to the general class of solutions (9) for codimension one
branes. since the exponent nx is negative, it follows from the general discussion of section
2 that this eld conguration can solve the gauge hierarchy problem in the manner pro-
posed by lykken and randall [11]. namely, physical particle masses will be exponentially
suppressed on any test-brane (tev brane) placed suciently far from the planck brane
featured in our solution.

4 generalization to higher codimension brane-universe

we would now like to generalize the previous results to the case of a brane-universe of
codimension greater than one. requiring rotational invariance in the transverse space, the
ansatz for the metric and for the (p + 1)-dierential form will be a function only of the
distance r in the transverse space:

the solutions (1721) take the same form, but the powers are now given by:

r =pyiyj ij .

where d1 is the volume of sd1, and l is an arbitrary constant which we will set to zero in
order to obtain cosmological constants in our results. (when d = 1 the sphere degenerates
into two points, giving 0 = 2.) the case of a brane of codimension two involves logarithmic
behavior, and we will not specify it in the following. as before, when the dilaton decouples
from the brane, the geometry can be derived from eective cosmological constants, as we
will now demonstrate. the components of the einstein tensor associated with the solution
(43) are

when the dilaton decouples,  = 0, implying nx = 1/(p + 1) and ny = 1/(d  2). the
metric can then be written as:

this is the geometry of adsp+2  sd1; r0 is the radius of the sphere and it is related to
the radius of the ads space by r0 = rads(d  2)/(p + 1). the expression of the einstein

what allows us to interpret them as eective cosmological constants is the fact that the
metric (46) is actually a solution to the einstein equations derived from a generalized rs
action:

(51)

where r is dened by r2 = yiyjgij . it is noteworthy that when the metric in the transverse
space is integrated out, this action reduces to the one introduced by rs.

in the expression (50), we notice that even if the power na = (d  2)/(p + 1) is positive,
the cosmological constant on the brane is positive. this would not be the case with only one
extra dimension, but when d > 1 the extra transverse dimensions that live on the sphere
also contribute to the singularity in the einstein tensor and modify the singularity coming
from the ads part of the space. nevertheless, our discussion of the hierarchy problem is
unaected by the spherical extra dimensions and thus a positive power na is undesirable as
regards the gauge hierarchy problem, since it implies that integral for the 4d eective planck
mass diverges. however a positive power na naturally generates a gauge coupling unication
along the lines of the scenario proposed in [10].

just as in the case of codimension one, the expression for the eective cosmological
constants in terms of supergravity quantities leads to their quantization in multibrane con-
gurations: the electric eld-strength increases by a factor n,  goes to /n and b goes
to 

b n 2/(d2).
not only does going to higher codimension brane-universes cure the problem of the imagi-
nary wesszumino term, but they can also be more easily embedded in a superstring frame-
work.
indeed, a d-3 brane in type iib theory does not couple to the dilaton and thus
provides an explicit realization of our construction. in this context it would be interesting
to incorporate in the eld theoretical analysis of rs some stringy corrections to the super-
gravity action, like quadratic terms in curvarture, for instance, since they can modify the
spectrum of the kaluzaklein gravitons excitations.

5 discussion

in this work we have presented solutions to the coupled equations for branes in d extra
dimensions and the low energy bosonic states of supergravity or superstring theories. the
goal was to reproduce the eective stress-energy tensor needed for the randall-sundrum
solution which uses gravitational trapping to solve the weak scale hierarchy problem. let us
summarize the results.

12

decoupled dilaton regime

regardless of the dimensionality of the tranvserse space, we nd that the stress-energy tensor
takes a simple form only in the limit that the dilaton eld decouples from the brane. then
there are three cases:

d = 1.

it is necessary to go to an unphysical value of the wess-zumino coupling,
a2
w z < 0, to obtain a solution, which does however then yield exactly the bulk and brane
cosmological constants needed for the rs proposal.

leading to trivial solutions.

d = 2. this appears to be an uninteresting case, because aw z is forced to vanish,
d > 2. we now nd solutions with positive b and physically acceptable values a2
w z > 0
for the wess-zumino coupling. the bulk energy term looks conventional (constant) in the
brane components of t, but it has a mild dependence on the bulk coordinates in the
tranvserse components of tij . the warp factor a(y ) goes like exp(+const|y |) in coordinates
where y represents the physical distance from the brane in the bulk (const > 0). therefore
the solution cannot be advocated to explain the gauge hierarchy problem between the planck
and electroweak scales. this is in qualitative agreement with the d = 2 solution recently
found in ref. [15]. it would therefore appear that the rs solution to the hierarchy problem
works only in the case of a single extra dimension5, or in the case of several intersecting
branes of codimension one. on the other hand, as shown in ref. [10], despite innitely large
extra dimensions, gauge coupling unication can naturally arise as a result of the anomaly
associated with the rescaling of the wave functions on the brane. moreover the presence of
the spherical extra dimensions can help to cure some phenomenological puzzles which occur
when there is only one transverse dimension, such as electroweak symmetry breaking and
obtaining small enough neutrino masses [10].

coupled dilaton regime

it is interesting to also consider the solutions where the dilaton does not decouple from the
brane. the bulk energy is no longer constant in these solutions, so the resulting stress-
energy tensor does not have the simple form proposed by rs. nevertheless, these solutions
are equally acceptable and may have interesting physical consequences.

d = 1. it is now possible to have a real-valued wess-zumino coupling, in which case
nx > 0. as explained in section 3, this implies that the brane has a negative energy density,
which is somewhat surprising, since pure scalar eld domain wall congurations always have
positive tension. since the tev brane in the rs proposal tends to have negative tension, it
may be relevant to explore the properties of such congurations.

d = 2. the solutions are no longer trivial, but have a logarithmic dependence on the

bulk coordinate. we have not studied this special case in detail.

d > 2. the term in t which looked like a bulk cosmological constant when the
dilaton coupling vanished now has nontrivial spatial dependence in the bulk. such behavior
has recently been proposed as a condition for avoiding the generic problem of the incorrect

5numerical solutions which we have found in the case of d = 2 also support this conclusion.

friedmann equation for the expansion of the brane [34].
in the latter, complicated and
a priori unmotivated expressions for the dependence of t55 on y were derived using the
requirement of correct cosmological expansion. although we have not yet found inationary
solutions in the present supergravity context, it would be interesting to do so in order to
check whether the y dependence of t55 advocated in ref. [34] can be justied by the presence
of nontrivial dilaton elds.

appendix: the boundary of an anti-de sitter space

an anti-de sitter space of dimension p + 2 can be seen as a hypersurface embedded in a
at space of signature (2,p + 1). let x,  = 0 . . . p + 2, be some coordinate system in this
embedding space. the anti-de sitter space of radius r is dened by the equation:

xx  x0x0 + x1x1 + . . . xp+1xp+1  xp+2xp+2 = r2

(52)

in a convenient system of coordinates

and the metric on ads is the embedding metric.
dened by

r

x  =

xp+1 + xp+2 x ,  = 0 . . . p,

the embedding metric factorizes:

and

r = xp+1 + xp+2 ,

(53)

(54)

ds2 =(cid:16) r
r(cid:17)2

r(cid:19)2
 dx   dx  +(cid:18) r

dr  dr .

the boundary of ads is the set of points that satises equation (52) at the innity of the
at space. more precisely, we can rescale the coordinates x  x  = x and consider the
limit   . the boundary is thus dened by the projective equations
x 0x 0 + x 1x 1 + . . . + x p+1x p+1  x p+2x p+2 = 0
x   x  with   r \ {0} ,

(55)
(56)
which clearly describe s1  sp. in the system of coordinates (53), the set of solutions to the
boundary equations has two disconnected pieces: the rst one is associated with r 6= 0, which
is sent to r =  by the rescaling, and it corresponds to a minkowski space of dimension p + 1
spanned by x0 . . . xp; the second piece is associated with r = 0, i.e. r = 0, and corresponds
to the union of a point and r  sp.
