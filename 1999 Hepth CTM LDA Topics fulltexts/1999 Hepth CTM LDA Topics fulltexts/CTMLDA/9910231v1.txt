abstract

we presented the proof of the positive mass theorem for black holes in einstein-maxwell
axion-dilaton gravity being the low-energy limit of the heterotic string theory. we show
that the total mass of a spacetime containg a black hole is greater or equal to the square
root of the sum of squares of the adequate dilaton-electric and dilaton-magnetic charges.

1 introduction

in general relativity, global quantities as a total energy or total angular momentum of an isolated
system do not arise naturaly as in special relativity. there were heavy attempts to prove that

the mass of an isolated system is positive. the story began in 1959 when partial results were
obtained by araki [1] and brill [2]. the rst complete proof of the positive energy theorem was

deviced by schoen and yau [3]. shortly afterwards, witten [4] conceived the elegant proof that
the adm mass of an asymptotically at spacetime containing matter satisfying the dominant

energy conditions is non-negative and vanishes in the case of a at spacetime. his reasoning was
based on the analysis of spinors fullling a dirac-like equation on a three-dimensional spacelike

hypersurface. soon after, parker and taubes [5] gave a mathematically rigorous proof of the
positive energy theorem. they completed and simplied the original arguments presented in
[4].

nesters attitude [6] treated the problem of the positive energy mass theorem in a fully
covariant way, in order to avoid technical diculties concerning the three-dimensional truncation

of the four-dimensional divergence theorem. in several papers [7] the issue of extending wittens
proof of the positivity of energy at spatial innity to a proof in the case of null innity was

considered. the authors established the positivity of the bondi mass. recently penrose et al.
[8] based on a causal structure and focusing proved the positive mass theorem.

soon after, the positive energy theorem was established, similar techniques were used to

prove several extensions of this result. gibbons and hull [9] proved the positive mass theorem
for einstein-maxwell theory and were able to derive a lower bound for the mass of the spacetime.

the positive mass theorem was also generalized to hold in supergravity [10] and in kaluza-klein
theory [11, 12]. in [13] it was shown that an inclusion of yang-mills elds, yang-mills-higgs,

dilaton interactions implied that self-gravitating solitons saturated a gravitational version of
the bogomolnyi bound on energy. in paper [14] the proof of the positive mass theorem in the

case of the low-energy string theory, i.e, the so-called einstein-maxwell axion-dilaton gravity,
was presented. a lower bound for the mass of a spacetime was derived in the theory under
consideration.

gibbons et al.

[15] extended the positive mass theorem to asymptotically at manifolds
containing black holes. recently, herzlich [16] provided the rigorous mathematical proof of the

black holes positive mass theorem. in [17] gibbons extended the geroch-wald-jang-huisken-
ilmanen approach to the positive energy problem and gave a negative lower bound for the mass

of asymptotically anti-de-sitter spacetimes containing horizons.
it was also shown that the
method gave a lower bound for the mass of time-symmetric initial data sets for black holes with
scalar and vectors. for a review of the positive energy theorem story see, e.g.,[18].

in this paper we want to provide some continuity with the work [14] and to some extent
generalize it. we shall consider the problem of the black hole positive mass theorem in the

so-called einstein-maxwell axion-dilaton gravity being the so-called the low-energy limit of the
heterotic string theory. our paper is organized as follows. in sec.ii the basic eld equations

of the theory under consideration were presented and the non-negativity of the black hole mass
was established. sec.iii summarizes our results.

in our paper the metric g has signature ( + ++) and  matrices obey the standard
condition {, } = 2g,  = 1
4[, ]. greek indices change from 0 to 3, while latin ones
from 1 to 3. indices with hats are refered to an orthonormal frame in which  a matrices are
hermitian and 0 antihermitian.

the so-called low-energy limit of superstring theories provides an interesting generalization of
the einstein-maxwell (em) theory. a simplied model of this kind in an einstein-maxwell
axion-dilaton (emad) coupled system containing a metric g, u(1) vector elds a, a dilaton
 and three-index antisymmetric tensor eld h. the action has the form [19]

where the strength of the gauge elds are descibed by f = 2[a] and the three index

in four dimensions h is equivalent to the peccei-quin pseudoscalar and may be written as
follows:

as a consequence of the denition (3) the action (1) yields

in what follows we will consider a spacelike hypersurface , with induced metric hij imbeded in
four-dimensional spacetime (m, g). a spacelike hypersurface  is assumed to be asymptoti-
cally at, i.e., there exists a at metric ij dened outside a compact set g such that   g is

r2(cid:17). kab
dieomorphic to the complement of a compact set in r3, hij = ij +o(cid:16) 1
is an extrinsic curvature of . the hypersurface element is denoted by dai while the boundary
at spatial innity by . one chooses the tetrad so that the zero indices vector is orthogonal to
the hypersurface . the manifold under consideration will contain a black hole and the main

r(cid:17), kab = o(cid:16) 1

task will be to evaluate the mass of the black hole.

in order to do so we introduce the supercovariant derivative acting on a spinor eld i is

given by the formula [20, 14]

 i = (4)

(11)

where i, k stand for so(4) indices, ik is so(4) matrix [21]. the suprecovariant derivative
(11) can be thought as a supersymmetry transformation about non-trivial gravitational, scalar
and u(1) gauge backgrounds [10, 14].

projecting the four-dimensional supercovariant derivative into the hypersurface  and multiply-
ing the result by  a and in the end equating the outcome to zero, one gets the witten equation

the motivation for introducing i is to achieve the desired mass bound for black holes. how-
ever, the expression (14) has also the motivation as the supersymmetry transformation laws of

the appropriate particles in the associated supergravity model.

now we turn to the question of a spacelike hypersurface  with an boundary h. we shall work
in the tetrad which e0 unit zero-vector is orthogonal to  and unit one-vector e1 is orthogonal
to h. the remainning ones lie in h. it happened that one cannot require the condition of
vanishing i on h to be satised. as was discussed in [15], the wittens equation would imply
that the derivative of i transversal to h also disappeared. so that one has i = 0 everywhere.
then, we need to restrict the freedom of i on h. following [15], one chooses the boundary
conditions as follows:

1



0i  i = 0.

(18)

the above condition restricts the freedom of spinors i on h by half. it is caused so by the fact
that the matrix 10 has eigenvalues 1, with eigenspaces of dimensions equal to two. taking
into account the wittens equation,  a (4)
a i = 0, admitting a solution satisfying the asymptotic
requirements and the boundary conditions (18) we will have a closer look at the surface term on
h in equation (15). after some algebraic manipulations, the surface term on h can be written

as

where we set a = 2, 3 and j denotes the mean curvature of h in . by d ai we dened [15]
the following derivative:

d ai = (2)

0i .

(20)

an inspection of equation (18) easily shows that the matrix 10 anticommutes with the operator
l = 1 ad a, thus the second term on the right-hand side of equation (19) vanishes if i satises
the boundary conditions. since then also (i) = (i )10 and (i )li = (i)li, which
implies that (i)li = 0. applying the same arguments, one nds that matrices 0, 05

5

anticommute with 10 then the third term of expression (19) disappear.
moreover, if h is a future apparent horizon [22], one has that k + j  k11 = 0. if h is a past
apparent horizon the same situation takes place [15]. then, one uses boundary conditions like
(18) but with a minus sign.

the last term of the considered equation vanishes if we impose the additional condition for axion
elds, namely that there is no axion currents on the horizon surface, i.e., (2)
thus we see that the right-hand side of equation (19) vanishes.

a = 0.

a

further, we shall assume that the matter energy momentum tensor obeys the following energy
condition

1

0 (cid:17)2
j(matter) + (cid:16)j e
and moreover, we impose the additional conditions, as follows:

t00(matter)  (cid:20)t0j(matter)t0

+ (cid:16)j m

0 (cid:17)2(cid:21)

2

,

i = 0,

k = 0.

(21)

(22)

the rst relation is motivated by the invariance of the entire system under the supersymmetry
transformation, while the other inputs relations among the elds appearring in the theory under

consideration. the very similar condition was obtained in the energy bounds studies in einstein-
maxwell-dilaton system [13] and in emad system without interior boundaries [14].

now we would like to remark on the existence of the solutions of equation (12). following the

reasoning presented in [15], instead of dealing with the spinor elds which tend asymptotically
to constant values at large distances on  we take into account a conformal transformation
compactify the hypersurface by adding a point at innity. the metric hij on a compact manifold
 will be conformally related to the metric on , hij = 4hij. the conformal factor  is required
r2(cid:17), while
to compactify an asymptotically at hypersurface  and it is of the form  = 1
k = o(cid:16) 1
r2(cid:17). as we shall take into account the behaviour on the horizon we set pa = 0 [15].
on the above smooth manifold with the boudary h the spinor elds i = i
2 obey the relation
as follows:

r + o(cid:16) 1

a i +

2k

0i +

2e2

2e

b(3)

b

a i 

b (ea  2ba5) 

 a (3)
where b = 2b and i is the covariant derivative with respect to hab. suppose that equation
(23) has a non-zero solution i(1) obeying the boundary conditions (18). then 2i(1) would be a
spinor eld on  which satises the witten equation, the boundary conditions on h and which
decreases to zero at innity like 1
r2 . in the light of equation (19) and conditions (21) and (22), it
will be a contradiction because of vanishing of the boundary terms. it shows that the conformal
wittens equation with the boundary (18) has no zero modes on . all these arguments suggest

0 abikk = 0,

(23)

that there exist a greens function to this elliptic boundary value problem [23]. in this way, one
can obtain solutions to the wittens equation on  fullling the boundary conditions (18) and

approaching a constant spinor at innity.
probably, the existence of a non-zero solution to equation (12) can be rigourously proved by

means of an isomorphism between some adapted sobolev spaces. we hope to return to this
question elsewhere.

to complete our considerations concerning equation (15) we shall consider the surface term

at innity. the relationship between the integral of the surface term at innity and the adm
mass may be demonstrated by considering solutions of the witten equation. by virtue of the

direct generalization of the arguments given in [4], one gets

(24)

where i is a spinor eld which is constant in some chart around innity. m is the adm mass
dened by m = padm padm , where padm is the adm four momentum. the dilaton-electric
and dilaton-magnetic charges of the black hole are dened respectively as

q(f) = zs

dsieei,

p(f) = zs

dsiebi.

the non-negativity of the left-hand side of equation (15) for any i, implies that

m  qq2

(25)

(26)

we have thus proved the positive black hole mass theorem in emad gravity.

3 conclusions

in summary, we have studied the positive mass theorem for black holes in emad gravity
being the low-energy limit of the heterotic string theory. we analysed an asymptotically at
spacelike hypersurface with induced metric hij, containing black holes. we have considered
spinors obeying the dirac type equation on this hypersurface. using the classical wittens

arguments we show that in four-dimensional manifold satisfying the energy condition (21) and
the two other requirements (22) imposed on elds in the theory, the adm mass of the black
hole in the theory under consideration is nonnegative, provided that the square of the total mass

of a spacetime containing the black hole is greater or equal to the sum of squares of the total
dilaton electric and dilaton magnetic charges of the black hole.
