abstract

we consider an extension of the coulomb gas picture which is motivated by liouville
theory and contains negative powers of screening operators on the same footing as positive
ones. the braiding problem for chiral vertex operators in this extended framework is
analyzed. we propose explicit expressions for the r-matrix with general integer screening
numbers, which are given in terms of 4f3 q-hypergeometric functions through natural
analytic continuations of the well-known expression for positive integer screenings. these
proposals are subsequently veried using a subset of the moore-seiberg equations that
is obtained by simple manipulations in the operator approach. interesting new relations
for q-hypergeometric functions (particularly of type 4f3) arise on the way.

1 introduction

the coulomb gas picture of rational conformal eld theory, and its various generaliza-
tions, has amply proved to be a very ecient tool for the computation of conformal blocks,
structure constants and braiding properties in these theories [1, 2, 3, 4]. interestingly,
coulomb gas techniques have turned out to describe (certain sectors of) irrational con-
formal eld theories as well, such as wznw theory and liouville/toda theory. within
the gervais-neveu quantization of liouville theory, an ecient formulation of screened
vertex operators, avoiding completely the manipulation of contours, was introduced long
ago in [5, 6, 7].

it was pointed out in ref.

the historical development of the exploration of liouville theory in the operator
framework was in fact such that for a long time, only primary elds corresponding to
the kac table were considered, in close analogy to the situation for minimal models.
the next step of generalization [8, 9] consisted in formulating observables with arbitrary
conformal dimensions, which however involved only a non-negative integer number of
screenings.
[10] that while those observables (the general
liouville exponentials) are formally described by an innite sum over positive integer
powers of screening operators, these innite sums do not permit any naive evaluation even
in the simple context of three-point functions. depending on the three-point function
considered, negative screening powers can arise as a non-perturbative eect, establishing
contact in this way with the goulian-li procedure [11]. the analysis of the three-point
functions furthermore suggests that there should exist a conformal algebra, closed under
fusion and braiding, involving chiral vertex operators with both positive and negative
integer powers of screenings. this would constitute a non-trivial generalization of the
standard coulomb gas picture and open very interesting perspectives towards an operator
formulation of a new class of irrational conformal eld theories.

a great virtue of the gervais-neveu approach consists in the fact that negative integer
powers of screenings are just as well dened as positive ones so that their introduction does
not require any analytic continuation procedure. negative and positive screening powers
are in fact related by a weyl reection [12, 13], exchanging one of the two equivalent
free elds of the gervais-neveu approach with the other. however, except for the cases
considered in [9], so far very little has been known about the braiding and fusion algebras
of vertex operators involving negative powers of screenings. it is clear that the r-matrix
and the fusion matrix should be given by an appropriate analytic continuation of q-
deformed 6j-symbols, as was the case already in the generalization from the kac table
to arbitrary continuous spins [7].

the objective of the present paper is to establish the braiding algebra of chiral vertex
operators with arbitrary integer screenings and continuous spins. the operator product
is then determined as well by the general proportionality relation of moore and seiberg
[14] between fusion and braiding matrices.

the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows:
in section 2 we introduce our notation and provide some well known background

material.

in section 3 we present our proposal (ansatz) for the analytic continuation of the
r-matrix to negative screening numbers. the continuation procedure is remarkably

1

simple, and uses no more than a well-known transformation formula for (truncating)
q-hypergeometric sums of type 4f3, which constitute the essential part of the analytic
expression for the braiding matrix. depending on the signs of the screening numbers
of the vertex operators to be braided, the standard braiding matrix for positive integer
screenings of refs.
[7, 8] can always be brought into a form such that the continuation
corresponds to a simple substitution of positive by negative screening numbers.

in section 4 we derive, as a simple consequence of the polynomial equations of moore
and seiberg [14], a system of determining equations for r-matrices with a mix of both
positive and negative ingoing screening numbers. we verify that our proposal fullls
these equations, starting with the case where only one of the vertex operators to be
braided has negative screening.
in the process we need several new relations for q-
hypergeometric functions, in particular of the type 4f3 and generalizations thereof. proofs
are outlined and will appear in more detail elsewhere [15]. we also discuss the delicate
issue of uniqueness of the solution.

in section 5 we turn to the class of r-matrices where both ingoing screening numbers
are negative. in order to verify our analytic continuation proposal for this case, we will
exploit the fact that it can be reduced to the ones treated in section 4 by means of a
concatenation procedure. substantial evidence in favour of our proposal is then provided
by checking explicitly the resulting identity for several non-trivial classes of examples.

in section 6 we discuss the connection of our extended r-matrices with 6j-symbols.
section 7 describes the trivial generalization from only one type of screening charge

to the case where the conjugate screening charge is included.

finally, section 8 is devoted to concluding remarks and a speculative outlook. we
discuss in particular the non-chiral case in the context of liouville theory, including the
strong coupling regime.

appendix a contains some useful observations on certain transformations of q-hyper-
geometric functions of type 4f3, whereas appendix b is devoted to further considerations
on the uniqueness of our proposal for the braiding matrix.

2 coulomb gas picture and liouville theory

we start by introducing our notation and by recalling some elementary facts about the
coulomb gas picture as used in refs. [6, 7, 8, 10]. as usual, coulomb gas vertex operators
are written as a product of a free eld vertex operator and some power of screening
operators. a particularity of the formulation chosen in the above references is that the
integration contour for the screenings is xed once and for all, and does not depend on
the correlator in question. concretely, for a vertex operator of spin j and u(1) charge
m we have

m ()  v (j)
u (j)

j ()sj+m()

(1)

with

v (j)
j () = ejx (),

s() = e2ih(+1)z

here, x() is a canonical free eld and  is the semi-classical screening charge, related
to the central charge c of the theory in the usual way:

c = 1 +

note that c is arbitrary continuous, and c > 25 for  real. in terms of the deformation

moreover,  is essentially i times the momentum zero mode of the free eld, and is taken
to be real in the following (this corresponds to the elliptic sector of liouville theory [19],
and is also the choice appropriate for instance for the description of minimal models in
this framework [20]). explicitly, one has

the braiding properties and the operator product of the u (j)

in ref. [21] in the case of degenerate operators (2j = 0, 1, 2, ... and m = j, j + 1, ..., j)
and generalized in refs.
[7, 9] to the case of arbitrary j and integer positive screening
numbers n = j + m. their algebra fullls the moore-seiberg equations [14] of conformal
eld theory [9].

for later use, we introduce a special notation for the leading order operator product

(fusion) of the two operators u (j)

m and u (j )

(as usual,  has to be given a small positive imaginary part to make the above expression

for any (positive or negative) integer values of the screenings.

local observables (in the liouville context they are the liouville exponentials) can
be constructed as bilinear combinations of the u (j)
m and their right moving counterparts
(j)
u
m , with -dependent coecients [6, 20, 7]. locality is a simple consequence of the
orthogonality relations obeyed by the q-deformed 6j-symbols that constitute the essential
part of the chiral braiding matrices. in the present paper, we shall concentrate on the
algebra of the chiral vertex operators; the application of the extended formalism with
negative screenings to the construction of local observables, as considered in [10], is left
for a future publication.

a crucial feature of the gervais-neveu approach is the introduction of a second free
eld, related to the one above by a quantum canonical transformation [5]. as pointed out
in ref. [10], this is of direct relevance for the problem of constructing negative (integer)
powers of screening operators: negative powers of screening operators in terms of x are
nothing else than positive powers of screening operators in terms of x, the second free
eld. therefore, there is no need of any analytic continuation procedure to dene negative
screenings, and the corresponding ambiguities are absent from the start. concretely, we
have (cf. ref. [10])

where s is the screening operator constructed from x.

we remark here that, x and x being completely equivalent, the replacement of
one by the other must not change any physical observable. from the quantum group
point of view, this means that observables are invariant not only under innitesimal
uq(sl(2)) transformations, but also under weyl reections [12, 13]. as discussed in [10],
for liouville exponentials outside the kac table (2j 6= 0, 1, 2, ...), this is a highly non-
trivial condition which is in conict with naive charge conservation rules familiar from
the standard coulomb gas picture. it serves, in fact, as an important guideline for the
correct non-perturbative evaluation of matrix elements of the liouville exponentials as
constructed within the gervais-neveu approach.

3 the braiding matrix

the braiding matrix r describes the braiding of the two chiral elds u (j)

m () and u (j )

m ()

m ()u (j )
u (j)

m () = xn1,n2

r(j, j ; )n2,n1

n,n u (j )

m2 ()u (j)

m1 ()

(10)

the ordering of  and  is implicit in this denition of r and we shall deal with the case
0 <  <  < 2 explicitly, reserving the notation r for the opposite ordering of  and
. the sums extend over the integers

n1 = j + m1

,

n2 = j  + m2

(11)

the ranges of which we shall discuss below. the parameters are subject to the condition

m1 + m2 = m + m

(12)

so that there is really just one sum in eq. (10). in general, the combinations

n = j + m

,

n = j  + m

(13)

are related to the screening numbers and have mainly been treated as non-negative inte-
gers in the literature. in particular, the braiding matrix for non-negative integers n and
n and arbitrary spins is known to be [7]

r(j, j ; )n2,n1

it should be noted that in the standard case (n and n non-negative integers) the sum-
mation in (14) truncates after a nite number of terms. we shall use the convention
y = sin(yh)/ sin(h).

a q-hypergeometric function (15) is balanced if g = a + b + c + d  e  f + 1 and
saalschutzian if furthermore d (or equivalently a, b or c) is a non-positive integer. a q-
deformed saalschutzian 4f3 hypergeometric function satises the standard transformation
(st) rule [9]

the present work is devoted to a discussion of the braiding matrix for the case where
the ingoing screening numbers are arbitrary integers. we will assume that the outgoing
screening numbers are also integers - see below for further comments on this point.

5

as the braiding matrix for non-negative integer screenings eq. (14) is expressed in
terms of a q-hypergeometric function, the most naive procedure for an extension to neg-
ative screenings would be to simply replace one or both of the ingoing screening numbers
n, n by negative integers and simultaneously allow the outgoing screening numbers to be
arbitrary integers. however, this would in general lead to q-hypergeometric sums that
do not truncate, and such sums may well diverge for |q| = 1 since the denominators of
individual terms cannot be bounded away from zero. the remedy is given by employing
st (16) before continuing the ingoing screening numbers after which a continuation re-
sults in a nite and well dened expression, as will be discussed below. we thus arrive
at an explicit proposal for the r-matrix, which will subsequently be veried.

3.1 analytic continuation

from a mathematical point of view, the extension of the explicit expression (14) to arbi-
trary integer screenings is certainly not unique as we are trying to analytically continue
a function given only on a discrete set of points. let us make a division into subcases
characterized by the signs of the ingoing screening numbers and treat them one by one.
the expressions for the r-matrices we obtain should of course only be considered as an
ansatz. the evidence for their validity will be given in the following sections.

3.1.1

i: positive-positive case, n, n  0

it is well known [7] that the set of chiral vertex operators corresponding to non-negative
screening numbers closes under braiding, ensuring that both of the outgoing operators
have non-negative screening numbers.
it is easily veried algebraically that precisely
then is the r-matrix (14) non-vanishing and has no poles in the limits where 2j or 2j 
becomes an integer1. the nite summation range for the truncating q-hypergeometric
function is given explicitly by

max(0, n1  n)  l  min(n1, n)

(17)

and n1, n2  0. this analysis suggests that a more natural expression exists for n1 >
n, which allows to avoid cancellations of the form 1!/1!. let us introduce the
 for the type i r-matrix (n, n  0) in the cases n1 > n and n1  n,
notation ri
respectively. by construction, ri
> is naturally represented
as

 is given by (14) whereas ri

2x  2j  2j  + n + n + 1, 2x  n  n2  1, n  n2 + 1

; q, 1! (18)

1such an analysis is similar in spirit to the discussion of fusion rules in ref. [4].

6

this expression may be obtained either by shifting the summation over n1  n  l  n
to 0  l  n2, or by a repeated use of st (16). in appendix a some useful techniques
based on st are discussed and the present situation is presented as an illustration.

3.1.2

ii: negative-positive case, n < 0  n

inspection of eqs. (14) and (18) shows that rii may be represented by exactly the same
mathematical expressions as ri when in the latter n has been continued to negative
integers:

rii

 = ri


,

rii

> = ri
>

(19)

for the second equality to make sense, it is crucial that eq. (18) vanishes term by term
for n2 < 0 due to the binomial prefactor. rii
 also vanishes in this case. an alternative
way to obtain eq. (19) is the following: in order to have a well dened and non-vanishing
r-matrix for n < 0  n and 2j and 2j  non-integer, we nd that the summation variable
l in eq. (14) must satisfy

0  l  min(n1  n  1, n) or max(0, n1  n)  l  n

(20)

it should be noted that there is no overlap between these two regimes. the rst regime
is excluded by our second demand that the r-matrix must be well dened in the limit
where 2j  is an integer (analyzing the limit where 2j is an integer does not provide new
information). this leaves us with

max(0, n1  n)  l  n  0  n2

(21)

the last inequality expresses a selection rule preserving the non-negativity of the screen-
ing number under braiding (from the left) with a negative screening vertex operator.

3.1.3

iii: positive-negative case, n < 0  n

in complete analogy with the analysis of case ii we nd that the type iii r-matrix may
be represented by the following single surviving range for the summation variable l (14)

max(0, n1  n)  l  n1  0  n1

(22)

accumulating the information from cases i, ii and iii, we observe that the property of
non-negativity of a screening number is preserved under any braiding; see also section 4.

3.1.4

iv: negative-negative case, n, n < 0

in the nal case where both n and n are negative integers our construction goes as
follows. we shall initially focus on the q-hypergeometric part of ri which will be denoted
i. employing st once results in the rewriting

i = 4f3  2j + n, 2j  + n2, n  n + n2, n

2x  n  n  1, n + n2 + 1, 2x  2j  2j  + n + n2 + 1

; q, 1!

n + n2 + 1, 2x + 2j  n  n, 2x  2j  + n + n2 + 2

; q, 1! (23)

7

it should be stressed that a possible pole or zero in i which is matched by an appropriate
zero or pole, respectively, in the prefactors of ri, must also be present in the right hand
side. in this sense, the two expressions are completely equivalent. now, the right hand
side is also well dened after the substitution ni  ni1. this is the core of our analytic
continuation and we dene the object i n21,n11
n1.n1 by the right hand side in (23) after the
substitution. the full type iv r-matrix is obtained by multiplying i n21,n11
n1.n1 by the
original prefactors in ri in which the substitution ni  ni 1 has been performed. the
shift by 1 in the substitution ni  ni  1 is convenient because riv is dened only
for purely negative ingoing screening numbers. nevertheless, let us state our proposal in
the form

riv (j, j ; )n2,n1

n,n = exp {i(x + x+m+m  x+m2  x+m)} q2nj +2n2j

(24)

where an additional st has been employed. here n and n are positive integers and
ni = ji + mi.

in conclusion, our two analytic continuation procedures result in the same expressions
for the braiding matrices. in case iv, though, only one approach seems to apply directly.
in [15] we shall return to the question of innite sum representations of q-hypergeometric
functions and braiding matrices.

we have seen that all four types may be constructed using well dened concatenations
of st followed by trivial continuations of one or two of the ingoing screening numbers.
thus, the approach based on repeated use of st demonstrates the universality of the
mathematical expression for the original braiding matrix. of course, this statement
pertains to our proposal only. in the following sections we shall argue for the validity of
this proposal.

3.2 weyl reection symmetry

in this section we shall perform a rst test on our proposal by comparing it with the
braiding matrices obtainable by weyl reection symmetry from the well known type i.
since weyl reections act on the screening numbers as ni  2ji  ni, subclasses of all
four types are reachable, depending on the signs of 2j  n and 2j   n. as we are not
addressing the question of non-integer screening numbers we shall restrict ourselves to
the case 2j, 2j   zz.

the explicit relation between sn and sn is

sn = snkn()

kn() = k1( + 2(n  1))k1( + 2(n  2))...k1()

(25)

(27)

and one may show that this reduces to

q2nj 2n2j r(j, j ; )2j n2,2jn1

2jn,2j n = q2nj +2n2j r(j, j ; )n2,n1
n,n

(28)

this relation may be seen as boundary conditions on our proposal imposed by the reec-
tion symmetry.

due to the universality of the mathematical structure of the braiding matrix, it is
almost straightforward to verify that our proposal satises (28). in principle, one should
distinct between the four resulting types of braiding matrices. however, we know from
appendix a that weyl reections for 2j, 2j   zz and (concatenations of) the sts we
employ commute so it is sucient to consider only one type. in the representation of
type i we have

q2nj 2n2j ri(j, j ; )2j n2,2jn1

4 double braiding relations for the type ii and iii

r-matrices

in this section we shall set up simple relations for the r-matrices using one of the polyno-
mial equations of moore and seiberg [14], namely the commutativity of fusion and braid-
ing. the moore-seiberg equations were originally set up within the context of rational
conformal eld theory, but can be viewed as a set of consistency relations for conformal
eld theory in general. for the present operator algebra, which extends the standard

9

coulomb gas in a rather non-trivial fashion, their validity may not seem self-evident -
especially since both fusion and braiding matrices involve an innite number of conformal
blocks. we will take the commutativity of fusion and braiding as an axiomatic starting
point of our analysis, though in principle our explicit operatorial construction should al-
low to discuss its validity. in any such discussion, manipulations with innite sums over
conformal operators will necessarily arise and one may speculate that the moore-seiberg
equations will act as a dening principle for their treatment; clearly, further analysis will
be necessary to elucidate this point.

there are several possibilities for choosing an appropriate equation system to study. it
turns out that a convenient choice is the recursive system to be analyzed in the following.

4.1 recursive equation systems

let us rst consider the product

u (j1)

m1 ()  u (j2)

m2 ()u (j3)

m3 ()

(30)

(7)) and braid through from the right the operator u (j3)

m3 (). demanding
(cf. eq.
that the above expression can be evaluated either by braiding rst and then fusing the
operators at , or vice versa, allows us to derive the double braiding relation

q2j2(n1k)r(j2, j3;   2m1)n2+n3l,l

n2,n3

r(j1, j3; )n1+n2+n3l+k,k

n1,n2+n3l

 u (j3)

n2+n3xl=0 xk
= xi

m3+n2n1l+k()u (j1+j2)
(j2j1)+lk()
r(j1 + j2, j3; )n1+n2+n3i,i

n1+n2,n3

u (j3)
n2n1+m3i()u (j1+j2)

i(j2j1)()

(31)

n1 is a positive integer while n2 and n3 are non-negative ones. the sums over k and
i could in principle contain non-integer values or even an integration, since they are
related to outgoing screening numbers about which we have no a priori knowledge as
soon as we leave the safe grounds of the standard coulomb gas with positive screenings
only. in appendix b, we present an argument involving degenerate eld techniques which
suggests that non-integer values may actually occur, with the corresponding r-matrix
elements decoupling from those for integer outgoing screenings. this is quite puzzling,
as one would expect our explicit operator construction to select one particular r-matrix,
removing the ambiguity. however, braiding problems with negative ingoing screenings
involve innite sums over products of outgoing vertex operators, the evaluation of which
is expected to be delicate [10];
in particular, several equivalent representations with
numerically dierent r-matrices may exist, as is suggested by the argument in appendix
b. these questions, though clearly important, go beyond the scope of this rst analysis
of the braiding problem with negative screenings. we will therefore discuss here only the
r-matrix elements for integer outgoing screenings. we consider the case n3 = 0 in eq.
(31) for which we may deduce the equation system

triangular equation system

q2j2(n1+ll)r(j2, j3;   2m1)n2l,l

n2,0 r(j1, j3; )n1+n2l,ll

n1,n2l

n2xl=0

10

= r(j1 + j2, j3; )n1+n2l,l

n1+n2,0

(32)

by comparison of coecients of like operators. for integer outgoing screenings, l is
integer. note that in any case there is no coupling between matrix elements for integer
and non-integer outgoing screenings. due to the triangular structure of this equation
system, all braiding matrices of type ii are determined recursively in terms of r-matrices
of type i and the subclass of type ii consisting of r-matrices of the form r(j, j ; )n2,n1
.
however, the latter may be determined by an additional and independent equation system
and a selection rule. consider the product

n,0

n/2 ()  sn()v (j )
u (n/2)

j  ()

(33)

and braid through from the right the operator v (j )
relation

j  (). one obtains the double braiding

r(0, j ;  + n)n1n,n1

n,0

r(n/2, j ; )n1nn
n,n1n

j  ()sn1nn

1()v (n/2)

n/2 ()sn

1n1()

v (j )
j  ()v (n/2)

n/2 ()

(34)

now we may use that degenerate elds remain degenerate elds after braiding [22] and
we derive the equation system

initial equation system

eihnj 

nxl=0

r(n/2, j ; )k,l

n,k+lnr(0, j ;  + n)k+ln,lk

n,0

= k,0

(35)

which we shall denote the initial one. this equation system xes the remaining inde-
terminacy, if we impose the additional selection rule

selection rule

r(j1, j2; )n2,nnn2
r(j1, j2; )nnn1,n1

n,n

n,n

= 0

= 0

for n > 0, n  0, n2 < 0
for n  0, n > 0, n1 < 0

(36)

all screening numbers are taken to be integers. the selection rule means that positive
screenings always remain positive screenings after braiding. this rule is certainly fullled
by our analytic continuation of the r-matrix as already discussed, but we do not have,
at present, an a priori derivation. its validity can be veried in the case where one of
the ingoing vertex operators is degenerate, cf. appendix b. it is an interesting question
whether it can be deduced in general by invoking other polynomial equations, or by using
more information about the explicit structure of the negative screening vertex operators.
if we consider the case of integer k and take into account the selection rule, we can

rewrite eq. (35) as

eihnj 

kxl=max(0,kn)

r(n/2, j ; )k,n+lk

n,l

r(0, j ;  + n)l,nl

n,0 = k,0

(37)

11

this equation system now determines recursively all remaining unknowns, if we consider
successively k = 0, 1, 2.... we will now outline the proof that our explicit proposal
is the unique solution of triangular and initial equation systems plus selection rule, if
only integer outgoing screenings are admitted. the argument is based on certain new
identities for q-hypergeometric functions and generalizations thereof. detailed proofs of
these identities will be presented elsewhere [15].

4.2 verication of proposal

here we shall verify that the analytically continued expression (14) subject to (21) pro-
vides a solution to the two double braiding relations discussed above.

we rst consider the triangular equation system (32). insertion of our proposal yields

the equation system

2x + 2j1  2j3  2n1 + 2n2  2l + 1  n2

l ! r(j1, j3; )n1+n2l,l+l

(38)



where

r(j1, j3; )n1+n2l,l+l

l + lil  n2i

n1  l + l + 1i2x + 2j1  2j3  2n1 + n2  l + 1i

(39)

r is merely the r-matrix (14) subject to (21) without the explicit phases and powers of q
which cancel out their analogues in the other r-matrices. our proof will be by induction
in n2 and it is recalled that n1  1. introduce the integer

n = n1 + n2  l

(40)

due to the selection rule, the equation system becomes trivial for n < 0, so in the
following we may assume that n  0.

it is easily veried that the triangular equation system (38) is satised for the initial
value n2 = 0. for general n2, the left hand side in (38) will be denoted l whereas the

12

right hand side will be denoted r. the nite double summation in l may be expressed
as

sj

(41)

l =xj0

where

sj

2j3  n2  n + j + 1l2x  2j1 + 2j3 + 2n1  n2l

we also introduce

sj({p}) = sj(2x + p, 2j1, 2j3  p, n1, n2  p, n  p)

(42)

(43)

where the parameters n2, n, 2x and 2j3 all have been subtracted p while the remaining
parameters n1 and 2j1 are left unchanged. r({p}) is dened analogously where the
unshifted r is given explicitly by

2x  2j3 + 2n + 1n1  n2 + n  1!2j3  n + 1n 2x + 2j3  n n1n21

r =

(44)

(45)

(46)

we shall make a case distinction and consider n = 0 rst in which case

lemma 1

s0 = r(2x, 2j1, 2j3, n1, n2, n = 0)

l = s0

for n > 0, let mk denote the following sum

mk = (1)n22x  2j3 + 2n + 1

(47)

where m0 = s0. the following lemma determines a relation between sj and mk.

lemma 2

for k < n2 we have

mk  mk+1 =

k+1xm=0

am

k sm({k  1 + m})

where

k = (1)k+m n1  n2 + n  1k+1m2j3  k + mk+1m
am

k + 1  m!2x + 2j3  n  k  1 + mk+1m

(48)

(49)

and in particular ak+1

k = 1.

it then follows that

l =

min(n,n2)1xk=0

kxm=0

am

k sm({k  1 + m}) + (n2 < n)mn2

(50)

from which (38) may be deduced, thus completing the proof of the triangular equation
system (32).

now we turn to the initial equation system (37). insertion of our proposal yields the

equation system

k,0

= 2x  2j  + 2k + 1(1)n nnk2x + k + 2nk2j k2x  2j  + 2n1
kxl=max(0,kn)

l!n  k + 1l

nl2x  2j  + n + 1l

2x  2j  + n + k + 2l2x  2j  + 2l

(51)





it is immediate that the right hand side vanishes for k < 0 and that it reduces to 1 for
k = 0. we may therefore assume k > 0. after a case distinction into 0 < k  n and
0  n < k the identity follows by induction in k and n, respectively, thus completing
the proof of the initial equation system (37). details on the proofs of both the triangular
and the initial equation systems will appear elsewhere [15].

4.3 the type iii r-matrix

so far we have only veried our proposal for r-matrices of type ii. type iii r-matrices
may be obtained from the latter essentially by hermitian conjugation. we have

j ()sn()v (j )

j  ()sn

(cid:16)v (j)

()(cid:17)

= sn()v (j )
() v (j )
= sn

j  ()sn()v (j)
j  () sn() v (j)
j ()

j ()

(52)

here we have used that for real , the two free elds are just hermitian conjugates of
each other [5] ( v (j )
j  and s denote operators constructed from the eld x). the order of
screening operators and free eld exponentials can be reverted to the standard form at
the expense of simple phase factors, so that

(cid:16)v (j)

()(cid:17)

j ()sn()v (j )

j  ()sn

= q2(jnj n) v (j )

j  () sn

() v (j)

j () sn()

(53)

the expression on the right hand side is of the type ii already discussed. braiding the
operators on the left hand side with the unknown type iii r-matrix, we obtain
r(j, j ;  2n1 +2n2 +2(j +j ))n2,n1

n,n q2(jn1j n2) = q2(jnj n)r(j , j; )n1,n2
n,n

(54)

the bar on the r-matrix on the right hand side indicates that this r-matrix braids an
operator at  with an operator at  (cf. comment following eq. (10)), contrary to the
one on the left hand side. notice also the replacement    in this r-matrix which
reects the fact that it applies to the braiding of tilded operators. the nal result for
the type iii braiding matrix thus becomes

n,n = q2[j(nn1)j (nn2)]r
r(j, j ; )n2,n1

(j , j;   2n1 + 2n2 + 2(j + j ))n1,n2
n,n

(55)

n,n diers from r(j, j ; )n2,n1

in the case of braiding of positive screening vertex operators, it is well known that
r(j, j ; )n2,n1
n,n only by a phase factor [21], and it is evident
from our analytic continuation procedure that the type ii r-matrix will keep this prop-
erty. therefore, we can write eq. (55) as a relation between r-matrices corresponding
to the same position ordering:

r(j, j ; )n2,n1

n,n = q2[j(nn1)j (nn2)]e2i(x+x+m+m x+m2 x+m)

 r(j , j;   2n1 + 2n2 + 2(j + j ))n1,n2
n,n

(56)

where m = n  j  and m2 = n2  j . eq. (56) determines the type iii r-matrix
in terms of the type ii one, which we have already veried. we show that our analytic
continuation fullls eq. (56) by considering separately the two cases n  n1 and n < n1.
from our formula for the type ii r-matrix, we obtain for the right hand side (up to
explicit phases and powers of q, cf. comment following eq. (39))

r(j , j;   2n1 + 2n2 + 2(j + j ))n1,n2

nxl=nn2

and by re-inserting it we recognize the left hand side of eq. (56). in the second case
n < n1, the summation on the left hand side of eq. (56) may be written

n1xl=n1n

(59)

nxl=0





and by re-inserting it we recognize the expression (57). this concludes the verication of
our proposal for the type iii r-matrix.

5 connection with 6j-symbols

the braiding matrix for vertex operators from the kac table was shown in [21] to co-
incide with q-deformed 6j-symbols for uq(sl(2)), up to normalization factors that were
determined explicitly. this result continues to be true for general positive screening ver-
tex operators [7, 9]. we will not show here that our expression for the r-matrix in the
presence of negative screenings can indeed be interpreted consistently as a q-deformed
6j-symbol - this would require verifying all of the dening properties of the latter - but
rather oer a most natural generalization of the standard relation between r-matrix and
6j-symbol, as given in ref. [8]:

r(j, j , )n2,n1

abc
n,n = ei(c+bef ) e
de
f
dbc

af na

d

the arguments of the q-deformed 6j-symbol are

a = j,
d = j ,

b = x + m + m,
e = x + m2,

c = x
f = x + m

and the coecients j12

j1j2 are given by

(61)

(62)

the last equation makes sense for arbitrary j1, j2, j12 such that j1 + j2  j12 is a non-
negative integer, but is readily extended to negative screening numbers if we dene prod-
ucts with negative upper limits as usual by

f (j) :=

nyj=1

qn

1

j=1 f (1  j)

as our method provides us directly with the braiding matrix, rather than the 6j-symbol,
eq. (60) should be read as our denition of (or proposal for) the q-deformed 6j-symbol,
extended to arbitrary integer screening numbers.

an extension to the purely negative case where all (ingoing and outgoing) screening
numbers are negative, has been provided in ref. [9]. here we shall show that our denition
(60) based on our proposal for the braiding matrix, reproduces (and generalizes2) the
result of [9] in the purely negative case. the idea is to verify invariance of our proposal
under the replacement ji  ji  1 (implying in particular that screening numbers are
transformed according to ni  ni  1)

which is the dening property for the extension in ref.
write down explicitly the well known q-deformed 6j-symbol

6 construction of the type iv r-matrix by concate-

nation

in this section we shall argue for the validity of our proposal for the type iv r-matrix
by explicit comparison with an expression obtained by a 3 step concatenation.

step 1 is a direct verication that our proposal for j = j  = 0 is identical to the
result of imposing weyl reection symmetry on the corresponding type i r-matrix. eq.
(28) readily ensures that. step 2 is then the generalization to j  = 0 and j generic, using
the result of step 1. finally, step 3 completes the generalization to j and j  generic. in
both step 2 and step 3, we consider the braiding of v (j)
j  sn(), for
n, n > 0.

j sn() with v (j )

6.1 step 2

the r-matrix we want to establish is given by

where 0  k1, k2  n + n by reection symmetry (whereby the sum over k1 is seen to be
nite). the right hand side can be further rewritten as (l1  l2  k2)

the right hand side is fully known as the type iii braiding has been solved. the upper
summation limit n2 is due to the selection rule and could also be inferred by a fusion
rule analysis (see section 3.1) of the left hand side. though we do not have a complete
proof of (72) we do have substantial evidence since we have been able to prove it for

8 conclusions and outlook

what have we learnt from the present analysis? first of all, we believe to have pre-
sented convincing evidence that there is a closed exchange algebra for a set of generalized
coulomb gas vertex operators involving positive and negative powers of screenings alike,
and we have obtained the explicit form of the braiding matrix in this general context,
through natural analytic continuations of the braiding matrix for positive screenings.
the basic lesson is that the additional structure generated by the inclusion of negative
screenings is essentially determined by the algebra for vertex operators with positive
screenings alone, through fundamental consistency conditions of conformal eld theory.
this is because negative screening operators are, in a rather precise sense, inverses of
positive screening operators. our results can be expressed, as in the positive screening
case, in terms of 4f3 q-hypergeometric functions which truncate.

as pointed out in appendix b, the question of uniqueness of our solution is more
delicate than might have been naively expected. whether there is a deeper meaning to
the formal possibility of introducing, in our analysis, r-matrix elements for non-integer
outgoing screenings merits further investigation. likewise, the origin of the selection rule
of section 4.1 should be elucidated. the technique employed in ref.
footnote
in section 7), which uses detailed input from the operatorial construction of the vertex
operators, may allow to shed some light on both of these questions.

[7] (cf.

to complete the description of the conformal algebra, we also need the fusion matrix.
while it should be given in general in terms of the braiding matrix through one of the

3it is quite remarkable that the technique used in refs. [7, 8] to derive the braiding matrix continues to
work in the presence of negative screenings. we have been able to show that the fundamental equations

products with negative upper limits. these equations could in fact have been used as an alternative
starting point for our analysis.

moore-seiberg relations, one could also think of an independent derivation along similar
lines as for the braiding matrix. it appears that this is in fact possible, and one obtains
recursion relations from the associativity (f f f = f f ) relation. we hope to come back
to this question in a future publication.

the growing body of results thus indicates strongly that on the level of the chiral
operator algebra, there exists a sequence of inclusions4, each representing a consistent
solution of the moore-seiberg equations; see fig. 1. the situation will, however, be
much more complicated on the non-chiral level, as will be discussed below.

another interesting direction for future investigations would be an analysis of the
quantum group aspect of the generalized coulomb gas picture advocated here.
it is
well known [24, 16, 17] that there exists another basis of chiral vertex operators (j)
m
which renders the underlying uq(sl(2)) symmetry of the algebra manifest; braiding and
fusion symbols for these vertex operators are given by universal r-matrix and 3j-symbols
for uq(sl(2)), respectively. the covariant vertex operators are related to those of the
coulomb gas picture by a basis transformation with -dependent coecients |j, )m
m .
in succession of our work ref. [10], we were able to carry out formally an analysis similar
to the one above within the quantum group covariant basis, with the role of the screening
number n played by n = j + m. it is not hard to obtain the braiding matrix for the
case where one or both of n, n  are negative (integer). the analysis is in fact much
simpler than in the coulomb gas basis as the algebraic expression for the r-matrix in the

4see ref. [9] for a discussion on how the kac table is embedded into the larger shells from the point

of view of the polynomial equations.

21

covariant basis is essentially just a ratio of q-factorials, and the generalized r-matrix can
essentially be obtained by naive analytic continuation. similar selection rules as for the
coulomb gas basis hold. however, the covariant vertex operators for generic 2j are given
by innite sums over coulomb gas vertex operators, the precise meaning of which is not
a priori clear. in particular, by replacing one free eld by the other, one would seem to
obtain two dierent copies of the same quantum group representation. it is interesting
to speculate whether non-perturbative mechanisms along the lines of ref. [10] will render
these two copies equivalent. we hope to return to the study of these questions in the
future.

8.1 non-chiral case and liouville theory

our analysis so far has addressed the chiral operator algebra only; let us now make
some more speculative remarks on the conformal eld theories that could be obtained by
combining the two chiralities, and in particular about the relevance of our analysis for
liouville theory. the general rule for constructing the non-chiral theory is that operators
of the latter should have crossing-symmetric correlators, and obey a consistent closed
fusion and braiding algebra. to nd the general answer to this question is, obviously, a
formidable task. however, within the operator approach to liouville theory, two mech-
anisms for producing local elds have been identied. in the standard weak coupling
(c > 25) regime, locality arises from the orthogonality relations for the q-deformed 6j-
symbols.
in fact, one writes the local elds - the liouville exponentials - as diagonal
combinations of left and right moving vertex operators, both in the sense of conformal
weight and u(1) quantum number m:

ej = xn0

n ()u (j)
a(j)

m (u)u

(j)
m (v)

(80)

with u :=  + , v :=   . the coecients a(j)
n () can actually be absorbed in the nor-
malization of the vertex operators, upon which the braiding of the latter will be given in
terms of q-deformed 6j-symbols alone [8]. mutual locality of two liouville exponentials
then becomes the statement that the contraction of left and right moving r-matrices
over the m-indices yields the unit matrix. when written in terms of the quantum group
covariant basis, eq. (80) simply becomes the singlet formed from left and right moving
spin j representations of highest and lowest weight, respectively. remarkably, this mech-
anism reproduces in particular the minimal models when one continues to central charges
c < 1; that is, there is a description in terms of liouville exponentials of the observables
of these models [20]. for c > 1 (in fact, c > 25), the closest analog of the minimal models
is liouville theory restricted to the kac table. the diagonal sums are nite (the n -sum
in eq. (80) truncates at n = 2j), and closure of the chiral and non-chiral algebra become
essentially equivalent.

when we leave the kac table, the situation changes rather drastically: it is no longer
possible to give a unique representation of the liouville exponentials in terms of a sum
over chiral vertex operators. as pointed out in ref. [10], this is due to two reasons: first,
the formal expansion eq. (80) cannot be evaluated term by term, using naive charge
conservation rules, when the sum is innite (see also ref. [25] for a recent discussion on

22

this fact from another point of view). second, when 2j is not an integer, the expansion eq.
(80) suers from a multi-valuedness problem as regards its zero mode dependence, and
therefore does not represent accurately the true liouville exponentials even classically.
according to the ideas of ref.
[4], adapted to the liouville context in [10], this does
not mean that such expansions cannot be used; rather, one needs to introduce a new
(continuous) parameter  which controls the monodromy properties of the expansion
with respect to the zero mode. one arrives then at generalized expansions of the form

a(j)
m;()v (j)

j v (j)

j s+ns+n.

(81)

xn

for the three point function, with operators situated at 0, 1, , all  parameters are
fully determined, up to integers. for the operator at z = 1, not replaced by a highest
weight state, one has to choose  such that the total monodromy becomes trivial, i.e.
the multi-valuedness disappears. one can in particular consider the set of three point



[10].

functions where  is of the form n + bn +

(n,bn integer), so that the exponential can

(80) or its generalization to both screenings +, . this was
be described by eq.
done in ref.
in this context, one already needs the negative screening operators
discussed in the present paper, because they are generated non-perturbatively by a careful
evaluation of the expansion eq. (80). the non-perturbative contributions can be rendered
perturbative in terms of an eective representation of the liouville exponentials that
can be evaluated using naive charge conservation rules:

ej

e

=

xn=

a(j)
n ()u (j)

m (u)u (j)

m (v)

(82)

it is an interesting question whether eq. (82) is more than just a recipe for the com-
putation of a class of three point functions. in ref.
[8] it was shown that eq. (80) is
compatible with locality in the sense that any two liouville exponentials of the form
(80) will commute at equal times, order by order in powers of screening operators (i.e.
perturbatively). it was also observed that in the same sense, the liouville equation is
fullled by the exponential with j = 1 (see also [26]).

it is natural to ask whether the same properties will obtain non-perturbatively, i.e.
when taking into account the additional negative screening contributions of eq. (82).
while this is essentially trivial for the equations of motion, non-perturbative locality
requires that

[ej(, ), gej (, )] = 0

here, both exponentials are given by eq. (80) and understood to be treated perturba-
tively, but the second one is constructed in terms of the free eld x. the results of
the present paper provide all the necessary tools in order to answer this question. one
has to show that there is a new orthogonality relation between q-deformed 6j-symbols
corresponding to positive and negative screenings, respectively; work on this problem is
in progress. if locality holds both in the perturbative and the non-perturbative sense, at
least for integer (positive or negative) 2j, this would be a hint that there exist consis-
tent conformal eld theories described by positive integer, and arbitrary integer screening
powers, respectively.

(83)

23

some counter-evidence, however, seems to be provided by the analysis of the per-
turbative operator product of two liouville exponentials. while it formally closes on
the set of liouville exponentials with integer positive screenings, there appear arbitrarily
strong short-distance singularities [8]5 that render the result dubious:

ej1(z1,z1)ej2(z2,z2) =

j1+j2xj12= x{},{}

ej12{},{}(z2,z2)



|z1  z2|2(j12 j1 j2 )hj12, j12; {}, {}|ej1(z1z2,z1z2)|j2, j2i (84)

where j := 0 + 2j  1 + 
h + 2j, and  denotes descendant contributions. the matrix
element on the right hand side represents the operator product coecient as well as the
descendant contributions to the conformal block given by j12; see ref.
[7] for details.
the contributions from very large negative j12 are non-vanishing in general and so there
appear unwanted short-distance singularities of arbitrarily high order as j12  .

even if there is a fully consistent non-chiral algebra involving only integer screenings,
we should be very careful as to its interpretation as a restriction of liouville theory. in
fact, the operator product of liouville exponentials is expected [27] to depend on all
operators entering in the correlator, and to involve hyperbolic states corresponding
to purely imaginary . crossing symmetry, or locality, should then involve the same
intermediate channels, and the interpretation within liouville theory of locality properties
based on integer screenings only is a priori not very clear. on the other hand, general
-dependent expansions of type eq. (81) would actually allow for the introduction of
hyperbolic intermediate states. consider a four point function with operators situated
at 0, 1,  and z, represented as

h4|ej3(z, z)ej2(1)|1i

(85)

the parameters 3, 2 appearing in the representation of the exponentials in the middle
are coupled by the monodromy condition. for a given conformal block, they have a
unique value. the question of what range to choose for the one free  parameter is thus
tantamount to the factorization problem, and imaginary  will in fact produce hyperbolic
intermediate states. while in liouville theory restricted to the kac table, locality and
conformal invariance are sucient to fully determine the operator construction of the
theory, we see that in the present, much larger context this may well be an illusion.
the simple correspondence between chiral and non-chiral algebras seems to be lost, and
additional information is needed for the construction of non-chiral correlation functions.
a careful analysis of the zero mode dependence of the exponentials, combined with group-
theoretical arguments as in refs. [28, 29], seems to be a step in the right direction. the
presence of a context-dependent, oating  parameter as we advocate it here, means
that general liouville exponentials will invoke arbitrary quantum group representations,
and not just highest or lowest weight ones as one could have naively expected from the
classical picture. this would resemble the situation in ane sl(2) current algebra where
continuous representations of intertwining operators appear for non-integrable weights

5the formula (84) corrects a misprint in ref.

[8]. note also that we are working here in euclidean

coordinates on the sphere where z := e

 +i.

24

[4]. in any case, it seems clear that a deeper understanding of the full liouville dynamics
will have to pass through a study of the algebra of the chiral vertex operators, and it seems
desirable to continue the program towards the analysis of arbitrary non-integer screenings.
the study of correlation functions of the chiral vertex operators may be interesting in its
own right, and is expected to lead to new mathematical functions already on the integer
(including negative ones) screening level.

8.2 application to strong coupling liouville theory

in a series of works [30, 31, 32, 9], gervais and collaborators have proposed a conformal
eld theory with 1 < c < 25 which they interpret as a candidate for liouville theory
in the forbidden, strong coupling region 1 < c < 25. this theory exists for certain
discrete values of the central charge (c = 7, 13, 19), and on a spectrum of highest weight
states specied by the unitary truncation theorems of ref. [31]. locality arises in a rather
dierent way; local observables become products of sums of chiral vertex operators rather
than sums of products, and each chiral factor is local up to a phase factor. the local
operators can be divided into two sets, one with negative and one with positive conformal
weights. the latter operators involve negative screenings; they can be written in the form
(we write the left-moving factor only)

(87)

(88)

with l  zz, r = 0, ..., 2  s. the screening number with respect to  is p  1, while
for + it is p. thus indeed, negative screenings are involved, and one can obtain a second
analogous set with the roles of + and  interchanged.

in the absence of an algebraic control over vertex operators with negative screenings,
the properties of the  elds were described using the formal symmetry j  j  1
of the q-deformed 6j-symbols already mentioned above. the present analysis not only
allows to further corroborate this discussion (at least as far as the braiding is concerned)
by establishing a direct derivation from the operator construction, but also opens the
road towards an investigation of new local operators with negative screenings which are
not accessible by the j  j  1 analytic continuation technique.

25

the results of the present analysis and its possible future extensions should also
nd direct applications in theories closely related to liouville, such as sl(2, r) or
sl(2, c)/su(2) wznw theory [28]. from a larger perspective, this program can be
viewed as a kind of bootstrap approach to irrational conformal eld theory in the simplest
context where the chiral symmetry algebra is just virasoro. it is an interesting question
whether all solutions can be identied either with (subsectors of) weak or strong coupling
liouville theory.

a concatenation of standard transformations

here we shall present some techniques involving st (16) relevant for the many manipu-
lations of q-deformed saalschutzian 4f3 hypergeometric functions employed in the main
body of the paper.

we are interested in the case where two of the four upper entries are integers and
one of the three lower entries is an integer. since our main focus shall be on the integer
entries, let

(89)

  a, b

c

!

represent such a situation. the remaining 4 entries are generic only subject to the
requirement of the q-hypergeometric function being balanced.
in order to keep the 3
integer entry structure, there are three classes of st applicable to (89). the rst class
does not aect the three integers. in the language of (15) and (16), it amounts to

c = a, d = b, e = c

(90)

by construction, either a or b must be non-positive and here we have assumed b  0.
the second class leaves only a and b unchanged. again we may assume that b  0 in
which case the second class of transformations is characterized by

c = a, d = b, f = c

(91)

the third class only aects one of the two upper entries, and assuming b  0 we have

a = a, d = b, e = c

(92)

a simple inspection reveals that 48 dierent congurations may be obtained by naive
(and repeated) applications of st. the lower entry may take on the 6 dierent values c,
1 + a + b  c, 1  a + b and 2 minus either of these. however, a priori not all of the

26

congurations thus obtained are well dened since we must have d  0. nevertheless, a
further inspection shows that all well dened congurations, the number of which depends
on the relations between a, b and c, may be obtained from one another by well dened
concatenations only.

let us illustrate the above by considering the well dened concatenation of sts trans-

forming (14) (subject to (17)) into (18). we have

1  n + n2 !    n1, n
  n1, n
   n, n2

n  n !
n  n !   n2, n
n  n !   n, n2
1 + n  n2 !

(93)

finally, a st of the rst kind may be needed in order to match all the entries of the
q-hypergeometric function. it is then straightforward to verify that multiplying all pref-
actors encountered in this repeated use of (15) with the original ones in (14), produces
the ones in (18).

an interesting property of st is that (modulo extra st) it commutes with all well

dened substitutions of the parameters

a, ..., g  a, ..., g = a + b + c + d  e  f  + 1

(94)

keeping the integer structure as in (89). that is, a, b and c  are integers and at least
a or b is non-positive. based on our classication above, the proof is almost immediate.
case 1 may be characterized by (90). for b  0 the statement is trivial whereas for
a  0 it becomes equivalent to

f  dce + f  a  bc
f ce + f  a  b  dc

=

f  cde + f  a  bd
f de + f  a  b  cd

(95)

which is readily veried. case 2 may be characterized by (91) and again the statement is
trivial for b  0. for a  0 it becomes equivalent to (95). case 3 may be characterized
by (92) and the statement is trivial for b  0. for a  0 we need an additional st in
order to prove our assertion. namely, employing st twice results in

4f3  a,

b,

c, d

e, f, g

; q, 1! =





f  cde + f  a  bd

b + c + d  e  f + 1da + d  f + 1d

which is readily veried.

(98)

where ei0 and ei1 are phase factors that will be specied below. the r-matrices with
spins 1/2 and j  are considered as unknowns, while the ones with spins 1/2 and j 
are known since the braiding of a degenerate eld with any other primary is determined
by null vector decoupling equations [22]. eq.
(98), as a two-term recursion relation,
has an innity of solutions that can be labelled for instance by an initial condition
r(1/2, j ; )l201,nl20
. note that while we assume that n is a positive integer, we
admit l2-values of the form l2 = l20 + p, with l20 a xed real number and p an arbitrary
integer. we can trivially rewrite eq. (98) as

1,n

l2,n =xn2

1,n

r(1/2, j ; )l2,1+n2l2

(99)

since 1 + n2  l2 can take the values 0 and 1 only (degenerate elds braid into degenerate
elds). now we multiply both sides by v (j )
j  sl2()snl2() from the right and sum over
l2 = l20, l20  1, l20  2, ..., or equivalently over l1  1 + n2  l2. when l20 is integer, we
get

otherwise the left hand side vanishes. for deniteness of notation, we will write down

sn1n2+l1() = v (1/2)

here, the renormalized product of eq. (7) reappears, and the phase factor is given by
eq. (8), i.e. eil1 = ql1. thus, eq. (100) becomes

when l20 is integer. this is the dening relation for the r-matrix r(1/2, j ; )n2,n1n2
and thus appears to be a triviality. however, in our derivation, r(1/2, j ; )n2,n1
1,n is,
a priori, not an r-matrix but a solution to eq. (98). in particular, it is not unique, as
long as we do not impose our selection rule. so the surprising conclusion is that there is
an innity of equivalent r-matrices for the braiding problem eq. (104). this conclusion
is not specic to the spin j = 1/2 and n = 1 but applies to type ii (and iii,iv)
in general, as can be seen immediately by concatenation type arguments. when the
starting value l20 is not integer, the left hand side of eq. (104) vanishes. this means
that to any r-matrix with integer outgoing screening numbers, we can add contributions
with non-integer outgoing screenings, if the latter are solutions to eq. (98).

of course, due to the presence of innite sums one may question the rigorousness of
various steps in the above argument, but it certainly poses an interesting problem, which
merits further investigation. note that except possibly for the step from eq. (99) to eq.
(100), the argument can also be read backwards.

an interesting special case arises when v (j )

j  sn() is degenerate (2j  positive integer,
0  n  2j ) so that the null vector decoupling equations control the braiding problem
eq. (104). the resulting braiding matrix has integer outgoing screenings and is non-
vanishing only for a nite number of n2-values. this braiding matrix is the only solution
to eq.
(98) with this property, and it is also the one that is produced by imposing
our selection rule - a welcome verication of the latter. however, eq. (98), even when
restricted to integer l2, also allows for solutions corresponding to innite braiding sums
in eq. (104), with n2 bounded from above but not from below. indeed, the vanishing
of r(1/2, j ; )l2,0
= 0
for i = 0, 1, 2, ... and 2j  positive integer, 0  n  2j . however, eq. (98) does not
enforce any truncation of these matrix elements at large negative i, though the equation
at l2 = n allows for such a truncation to occur through the vanishing of the r-matrix
element r(1/2, j ; )l21,nl2

1,l21 for l2 = 2j  + 1 implies that r(1/2, j ; )2j +1+i,n2j 2i

on the right hand side.

from the point of view of the monodromy analysis for solutions of the null vector
decoupling equations, the appearance of additional solutions seems to be consistent only
if there exist formal innite linear combinations of q-hypergeometric functions (for j  =
1/2) and their generalizations, with parameters varying as a function of n2, that vanish.
the study of these questions is left for further analysis.
