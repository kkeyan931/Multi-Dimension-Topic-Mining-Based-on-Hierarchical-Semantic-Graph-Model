abstract

we study the strong coupling limit of the 2-avor massless schwinger model on a lattice using
staggered fermions and the hamiltonian approach to lattice gauge theories. using the correspon-
dence between the low-lying states of the 2-avor strongly coupled lattice schwinger model and the
antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain established in a previous paper, we explicitly compute the mass
spectrum of this lattice gauge model: we identify the low-lying excitations of the schwinger model
with those of the heisenberg model and compute the mass gaps of other excitations in terms of vac-
uum expectation values (v.e.v.s) of powers of the heisenberg hamiltonian and spin-spin correlation
functions. we nd a satisfactory agreement with the results of the continuum theory already at the
second order in the strong coupling expansion. we show that the pattern of symmetry breaking
of the continuum theory is well reproduced by the lattice theory; we see indeed that in the lattice

theory the isoscalar (cid:10) (cid:11) and isovector (cid:10) a(cid:11) chiral condensates are zero to every order in the

strong coupling expansion. in addition, we nd that the chiral condensate < 
r >
is non zero also on the lattice; this is the relic in this lattice model of the axial anomaly in the
continuum theory.

we compute the v.e.v.s of the spin-spin correlators of the heisenberg model which are pertinent
to the calculation of the mass spectrum and obtain an explicit construction of the lowest lying states
for nite size heisenberg antiferromagnetic chains.

1 introduction

one of the analytical approaches to the study of gauge theories with conning spectra is the
strong coupling expansion.
in the strong coupling limit, connement is explicit, the conning
string is a stable object[1] and some other qualitative features of the spectrum are easily obtained.
formulation of the strong coupling expansion requires a gauge invariant ultraviolet cuto, which is
most conveniently implemented using a lattice regularization.

one of the most dicult problems of the strong coupling approach to lattice gauge theory is its
extrapolation to the continuum limit, which usually occurs at weak coupling. one symptom of this
problem is that many choices of strong coupling theory produce identical continuum physics. in
spite of this diculty, there are strong coupling computations which claim some degree of success [2,
3, 4, 5, 6]. it is well known that between strongly coupled lattice gauge theories and quantum spin
systems there is an intimate relationship [7, 8, 9] which is most useful to analyze chiral symmetry
breaking in a variety of lattice models.

a useful test of strong coupling expansions in lattice gauge theories is the study of models whose
solution in the continuum is known even in the strong coupling regime. for example, the 1-avor
schwinger model has been studied using the hamiltonian lattice eld theory within the strong
coupling expansion [3, 4]; several relevant parameters, analytically computed on the lattice, are
shown to be in good agreement with those of the exact continuum solution [4]. furthermore, issues
involving the realization of chiral symmetry on the lattice can be studied systematically [4]. the
1-avor schwinger model has also been used as an example of the fact that quantum link models
may reproduce the physics of conventional hamiltonian lattice gauge theories [10]. the physically
more interesting case of the 2-avor schwinger model has been studied in [5, 6]; in addition to
the issues of spectrum and chiral symmetry breaking, one sees that the strong coupling limit of
this model is mapped [11, 6] on a relevant quantum spin model  the one-dimensional spin-1/2
quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet. this correspondence is very useful since the ground state
of the antiferromagnetic chain is known [12] and its energy has been computed in [13]; moreover,
the complete spectrum has been determined by faddeev and takhtadzhyan [14] using the algebraic
bethe ansatz.

there are by now many hints at a correspondence between quantized gauge theories and quantum
spin models, aimed at analyzing new phases relevant for condensed matter systems [15]. recently,
laughlin has argued that there is an analogy between the spectral data of gauge theories and
strongly correlated electron systems [16]. moreover, certain spin ladders have been related to the
2-avor schwinger model in ref. [11] where a relation between the physical parameters of the spin
and the gauge systems was also found.

in this context, the mapping between the strongly coupled 2-avor schwinger model and the
quantum heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain provides a concrete computational scheme in which
the issue of the correspondence between quantized gauge theories and quantum spin models may
be investigated. because of the dimensionality of the coupling constant in (1+1)-dimensions, the
infrared behavior is governed by the strong coupling limit, and it is tempting to conjecture the
existence of an exact correspondence between the infrared limits of the heisenberg and 2-avor
schwinger models.

in this paper we revisit the strong coupling limit of the 2-avor lattice schwinger model in the
hamiltonian formalism with staggered fermions. using the results of ref.[6] we analyze in detail the
spectrum of the model: the gauge theory vacuum is the ground state of the heisenberg antiferromag-
netic chain and we nd that the low-lying excitations of the gauge model have the same quantum
numbers of the states of the spin chain. in addition we compute the masses of the excitations to
the second order in the strong coupling expansion; as pointed out in [6], the computation needs the
knowledge of some spin-spin correlators of the quantum heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain, which
we explicitly compute [17, 18]. our analysis hints to the existence of two other massive isotriplet
states in addition to the expected pseudoscalar massive isosinglet.

we analyze then the pattern of symmetry breaking in the lattice theory. even though the
continuum axial symmetry is broken explicitly by the staggered fermions, a discrete axial symmetry

1

remains, it corresponds to a chiral rotation of /2 and appears in the lattice theory as a translation
by one lattice site. since the ground state of the heisenberg chain is unique and translationally
invariant - at variance with the one avor schwinger model - in the 2-avor model the discrete
axial symmetry is unbroken. the chiral anomaly in this model is realized on the lattice via the
explicit breaking of the ua(1)-symmetry induced by the staggered fermions. therefore, the pattern
of symmetry breaking on the lattice reproduces faithfully the one of the continuum theory.

we also compute the chiral condensates in the strongly coupled 2-avor lattice schwinger model
in the

showing that the results of the lattice are in agreement with those of the continuum.

continuum there is neither an isoscalar(cid:10) (cid:11) nor an isovector(cid:10) a(cid:11) chiral condensate, since this
is forbidden by the coleman theorem [19]. we show that on the lattice these fermion condensates are
also zero to all the orders in the strong coupling expansion. we nd that  just as in the continuum
theory  the non-vanishing chiral condensate is given by the v.e.v. < 
r >, which we
compute up to the second order in the strong coupling expansion.

we nally use both the mass spectrum and the non-vanishing chiral condensate to compute,
by means of suitable pade approximants, the physical parameters of this lattice model and then
compare their numerical values with the exact results of the continuum theory.

in section 2 we review known results [20, 21] of the continuum 2-avor schwinger model and
dene its hamiltonian lattice version. we also identify the lattice counterparts of the relevant
symmetries used in [20] for the description of the spectrum of the continuum theory.

in section 3 we expand the results of ref.[6] and set up the formalism needed for the strong
coupling analysis of the lattice 2-avor schwinger model. we show that the ground and excited
states of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model have the spectrum and quantum numbers which
are expected for the ground state and massless excitations of the 2-avor schwinger model.

in section 4 we construct the operators that create the massive excitations when acting on the
ground state. we set up the strong coupling expansion and compute the corrections to the energies
of the ground state and of the low-lying massive bosonic excitations. subtracting the energy of the
ground state from those of the excitations denes the lattice meson masses.

in section 5 we show that both the isoscalar and the isovector chiral condensates are zero to every
perturbative order in the strong coupling expansion due to the translational invariance of the strong
coupling ground state. we also compute, up to the second order in the strong coupling expansion,
the chiral condensate < 
r >, which is the order parameter for the breaking of the
ua(1) symmetry.

section 6 is devoted to the comparison of the lattice results with the continuum theory; there
we shall see that the lattice theory, properly extrapolated to the continuum via the use of pade
approximants, well reproduces the parameters of the continuum theory already at the second order
of the strong coupling expansion.

section 7 is devoted to some concluding remarks.

in the appendix a, after reviewing known results about the bethe ansatz solution [14] of the
antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain, we study explicitly the complete spectrum of nite size heisen-
berg antiferromagnetic chains of 4 and 6 sites in order to compare it to the bethe ansatz solution
obtained in the thermodynamic limit. we write down explicitly the ground states of 4,6 and 8 site
chains and we nd the that, even for these very small systems, the results exhibited in [14] are very
well reproduced. this provides also an useful intuitive picture of the strong coupling ground state
of the 2-avor lattice schwinger model.

in appendix b we comment on the computation of the spin-spin correlator of the heisenberg

chain and provide a link between the results given in [17] and the method used in [18].

the theory has an internal sul(2)  sur(2)-avor isospin symmetry; the dirac elds are an
isodoublet whereas the electromagnetic eld is an isosinglet. it is well known that in 1+1 dimensions
there is no spontaneous breakdown of continuous internal symmetries, unless there are anomalies
or the higgs phenomenon occurs. neither mechanism is possible in the 2-avor schwinger model
for the sul(2)  sur(2)-symmetry: isovector currents do not develop anomalies and there are no
gauge elds coupled to the isospin currents. the particles belong then to isospin multiplets. for
what concerns the u (1) gauge symmetry there is an higgs phenomenon [22].

it is well known that at the quantum level the vector and axial currents cannot be simultaneously
conserved, due to the anomaly phenomenon [23]. if the regularization is gauge invariant, so that
the vector current is conserved, then the axial current acquires the anomaly which breaks the
ua(1)-symmetry

the isoscalar and isovector chiral condensates are zero due to the coleman theorem [19]; in fact,
they would break not only the ua(1) symmetry of the action, but also the continuum internal
symmetry sul(2)  sur(2) down to suv (2). there is, however, a sul(2)  sur(2) invariant
operator, which is non-invariant under the ua(1)-symmetry; it can acquire a non-vanishing v.e.v
without violating colemans theorem and consequently may be regarded as a good order parameter
for the ua(1)-breaking. its expectation value is given by [24, 25]

it describes a process in which two right movers are anihilated and two left movers are created.
note that f , being quadrilinear in the elds, is actually invariant under chiral rotations of /2,
namely under the discrete axial symmetry

a(x)  5a(x)

a(x)   a(x)5 .

(2.14)

as a consequence, this part of the chiral symmetry group is not broken by the non-vanishing v.e.v.
of f (2.13).

as we shall see in section 6, the lattice theory faithfully reproduces the pattern of symmetry
breaking of the continuum theory; this happens even if on the lattice the su (2)-avor symmetry is
not protected by the coleman theorem. the isoscalar and isovector chiral condensates are zero also
on the lattice, whereas the operator f acquires a non-vanishing v.e.v. due to the coupling of left
and right movers induced by the gauge eld. the continuous axial symmetry is broken explicitly
by the staggered fermion, but the discrete axial symmetry (2.14) remains.

in the massive su (2) schwinger model  when the mass of the fermion m is small compared
to e2 (strong coupling)  coleman [20] showed that  in addition to the triplet  (i p g = 1+)
 the low-energy spectrum exhibits a singlet i p g = 0++ lying on top of the triplet . in this
limit the gauge theory is mapped to a sine-gordon model and the low-lying excitations are soliton-
antisoliton states. when m  0, these soliton-antisoliton states become massless [21]; in this limit,
the analysis of the many body wave functions, carried out in ref.[21], hints to the existence of a
whole class of massless states with positive g-parity; p-parity however cannot be determined with
the procedure developed in [21]. these are not the only excitations of the model: way up in mass
there is the isosinglet i p g = 0, (+), already discussed in ref. [20]. the model exhibits also
triplets, whose mass  of order ms or greater  stays nite [21]; among the triplets there is a
g-even state 1.

3 the strong coupling limit and the antiferromagnetic heisen-

berg hamiltonian

in a previous paper [6] we showed that the low-lying spectrum of the 2-avor lattice schwinger
model in the strong coupling limit is equivalent to the spectrum of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg
model. there we also showed that the mass of the massive excitations can be computed in terms
of correlators of the heisenberg model.
it is our purpose in this section to further explore this
equivalence and to set up the formalism needed in what follows.

we shall consider the strong coupling perturbative expansion where the coulomb hamiltonian
(3.37) is the unperturbed hamiltonian and the hopping hamiltonian (3.38) the perturbation. due
to eq.(2.34) every conguration with one particle per site has zero energy, so that the ground state
of the coulomb hamiltonian (3.37) is 2n times degenerate. the degeneracy of the ground state
can be removed only at the second perturbative order since the rst order is trivially zero.

at the second order the lattice gauge theory is eectively described by the antiferromagnetic

heisenberg hamiltonian. the vacuum energy  at order 2  reads

e(2)
0 =< hh



e(0)
0  h0

hh >

(3.41)

where the expectation values are dened on the degenerate subspace and  is the operator projecting
on a set orthogonal to the states with one particle per site. due to the vanishing of the charge
density on the ground states of h0, the commutator

[h0, hh] = hh

(3.42)

holds on any linear combination of the degenerate ground states. consequently, from eq.(3.41) one
nds

e(2)
0 = 2 < rl > .

(3.43)

on the ground state the combination rl can be written in terms of the heisenberg hamiltonian.

taking into account that products of lx and ry at dierent points have vanishing expectation
values on the ground states, and using eq.(3.46), eq.(3.43) reads

e(2)

0 = 4 < hj > .

(3.47)

the ground state of hj singles out the correct vacuum, on which to perform the perturbative
expansion. in one dimension hj is exactly diagonalizable [12, 29]. in the spin model a avor 1
particle on a site can be represented by a spin up, a avor 2 particle by a spin down. the spectrum of
hj exhibits 2n eigenstates; among these, the spin singlet with lowest energy is the non degenerate
ground state |g.s. >.

we shall construct the strong coupling perturbation theory of the 2-avor schwinger model using
|g.s. > as the unperturbed ground state. |g.s. > is invariant under translations by one lattice site,
which amounts to invariance under discrete chiral transformations. as a consequence, at variance
with the 1-avor model [4], chiral symmetry cannot be spontaneously broken even in the innite
coupling limit.

|g.s. > has zero charge density on each site and zero electric ux on each link

coecients are not explicitly known for general n .
explicitly for nite size systems of 4, 6 and 8 sites. the heisenberg energy of |g.s. > is known
exactly and, in the thermodynamic limit, is [13, 14]

2 spins up and n

hj|g.s. >= (n ln 2)|g.s. > .

(3.49)

eq.(3.49) provides the second order correction eq.(3.47) to the vacuum energy, e(2)

g.s. = 4n ln 2.
there exist two kinds of excitations created from |g.s. >; one kind involves only spin ipping
and has lower energy since no electric ux is created, the other involves fermion transport besides
spin ipping and thus has a higher energy. for the latter excitations the energy is proportional to
the coupling times the length of the electric ux: the lowest energy is achieved when the fermion is
transported by one lattice spacing. of course only the excitations of the rst kind can be mapped
into states of the heisenberg model.

in [14] the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model excitations have been classied. there it was
shown that any excitation may be regarded as the scattering state of quasiparticles of spin- 1
2 : every
physical state contains an even number of quasiparticles and the spectrum exhibits only integer spin
states. the two simplest excitations of lowest energy in the thermodynamic limit are a triplet and
a singlet [14]; they have a dispersion relation depending on the momenta of the two quasiparticles.
for vanishing total momentum (relative to the ground state momentum pg.s. = 0 for n
2 even,
pg.s. =  for n
2 odd) in the thermodynamic limit they are degenerate with the ground state.

in the appendix a we show that even for nite size systems, the excited states can be grouped
in families corresponding to the classication given in [14]. we explicitly exhibit all the energy
eigenstates for n = 4 and n = 6. the lowest lying are a triplet and a singlet, respectively; they
have a well dened relative (to the ground state) p -parity and g-parity  1+ for the triplet and
0++ for the singlet. since they share the same quantum numbers these states can be identied, in
the limit of vanishing fermion mass, with the soliton-antisoliton excitations found by coleman in
his analysis of the 2-avor schwinger model. a related analysis about the parity of the lowest lying
states in nite size heisenberg chains, has been given in [30].

moreover in [14] a whole class  maf  of gapless excitations at zero momentum was singled out
in the thermodynamic limit; these states are eigenstates of the total momentum and consequently
have positive g-parity at zero momentum. the low-lying states of the schwinger model also contain
[21] many massless excitations with positive g-parity; they are identied [6] with the excitations
belonging to maf . the mass of these states in the schwinger model can be obtained from the
dierences between the excitation energies at zero momentum and the ground state energy. the
energies of the states |ex. > belonging to the class maf have the same perturbative expansion of
the ground state. consequently, the states |ex. > at zero momentum up to the second order in the
strong coupling expansion have the same energy of the ground state (3.41), e(2)
ex = 4n ln 2. to
this order the mass gap is zero. higher order corrections may give a mass gap.

4 the meson masses

in this section we determine the masses for the states obtained by fermion transport of one site
on the heisenberg model ground state. our analysis shows that besides the g-odd pseudoscalar

isosinglet 0 with mass ms = ep2/, there are also a g-even pseudoscalar isotriplet 1+ and a

g-odd scalar isotriplet 1+ with masses of the order of ms or greater. the quantum numbers are
relative to those of the ground state i p g

g.s. = 0++ for n/2 even i p g

g.s. = 0 for n/2 odd.

two states can be created using the spatial component of the vector j1(x) eq.(2.10) and isovector
j1
(x) eqs.(2.8,2.9) schwinger model currents. they are the g-odd pseudoscalar isosinglet i p g =
0 and the g-even pseudoscalar isotriplet i p g = 1+. the lattice operators with the correct

one immediately recognizes that the excitation spectrum is determined once < g.s.|~sx ~sx+2|g.s. >
is known. equations similar to eq.(4.62) may be established also at a generic order of the strong
coupling expansion.

the v.e.v. of each squared component of ~v on the rotationally invariant singlet |g.s. > give the
same contribution i.e. ds(t) = ds(t0): the triplet states (as in the continuum theory) have a
degenerate mass gap. this is easily veried by direct computation on nite size systems; when the
size of the system is nite one may also show that ds is of zeroth order in n.

the excitation masses are given by ms = e2

quently, the (n -dependent) ground state energy terms appearing in e(2)

in principle one should expect also excitations created acting on |g.s. > with the chiral currents,

5 the correlators px < g.s.|~sx  ~sx+2|g.s. > and < g.s.|~v 2|g.s. >

in this section we compute the spin-spin correlators needed to evaluate the second order energies of
the isosinglet and isotriplets derived in section 4. the explicit computation of spin-spin correlation
functions is far from being trivial since g(r) < g.s.|~s0  ~sr|g.s. > is not known for arbitrary
lattice separations r. for r = 2 it was computed by m. takahashi [17] in his perturbative analysis
of the half lled hubbard model in one dimension. for r > 2 no exact numerical values of g(r)
are known. in [18] were given two representations of g(r), while in [31, 32] the exact asymptotic
(r  ) expression of g(r) was derived.

in order to explicitly compute the second order energies eq.(4.62) and eq.(4.63) one has to

evaluate the correlation function

g(2) =

1
n

n

xx=1

< g.s.|~sx  ~sx+2|g.s. >

which has been exactly computed in [17] and is given by

g(2) =

1
4

(1  16 ln 2 + 9(3)) = 0.1820 .

(5.80)

(5.81)

in the appendix b we shall show how the knowledge of this correlator allows one to compute
explicitly the rst three emptiness formation probabilities, used in ref.[18] in the study of the
heisenberg chain correlators, g(r).

in order to compute the mass of the isotriplet one has to evaluate also the correlation functions

appearing in eq.(4.63); namely < g.s.|~v  ~v |g.s. >, where ~v =px sxsx+1. the explicit expression

of this function is not known. for its evaluation it is most useful to rearrange this correlator as

n

< g.s.|~v  ~v |g.s. >=

(< g.s.|(~sx  ~sy)(~sx+1  ~sy+1)|g.s. >

xx,y=1

 < g.s.|(~sx  ~sy+1)(~sx+1  ~sy)|g.s. >) 

n

xx=1

< g.s.|~sx  ~sx+1|g.s. >

.

(5.82)

it is possible to extract a numerical value from eq.(5.82) only within the random phase approxi-
mation [17, 33]. for this purpose it is rst convenient to rewrite the unconstrained sum over the
sites x and y as a sum where all the four spins involved in the v.e.v.s lie on dierent sites,

< g.s.|~v  ~v |g.s. > = xy6=x

y6=x1

(< g.s.|(~sx  ~sy)(~sx+1  ~sy+1)|g.s. >

n

xx=1

< g.s.|~sx  ~sx+1|g.s. > 

n

xx=1

< g.s.|~sx  ~sx+2|g.s. > (5.83)

and then factorize the four spin operators in eq.(5.83) as

< g.s.|~v  ~v |g.s. >  n



xr=2

(< g.s.|~s0  ~sr|g.s. >2  < g.s.|~s0  ~sr+1|g.s. >< g.s.|~s1  ~sr|g.s. >)

of course, eq.(5.84) provides an answer larger than the exact result; terms such as < (. . .)(. . .) >
contain negative contributions which are eliminated once one factorizes them in the form < (...) ><
(...) >. this is easily checked also by direct computation on nite size systems.

the spin-spin correlation functions g(r) are exactly known for r = 1, 2. for the spin-spin
correlation functions g(r) up to a distance of r = 30 the results are reported in table (1) [31, 34].

equations (5.91), (5.93) and (5.94) provide the values of ms, mt and mt 5 for small values of
z = 2 = t2
la4 up to the second order in the strong coupling expansion. whereas (5.93) is only
e4
approximate (5.91) and (5.94) are exact at the second order in the  expansion. in section 6 we
shall extrapolate these masses to the continuum limit using the standard technique of the pade
approximants.

6 the chiral condensate

in the following we shall rst prove that also on the lattice either the isoscalar(cid:10) (cid:11) or the isovector
(cid:10) a(cid:11) chiral condensates are zero to every order of perturbation theory. this should be veried
by explicit computation since on the lattice the symmetry sul(2)  sur(2) is already broken by
introducing staggered fermions; thus, there is no symmetry to prevent the formation of such chiral
in the continuum theory, instead, the breaking of the sul(2)  sur(2) down to
condensates.
suv (2) is prevented by the coleman theorem [19].

in the staggered fermion formalism the isoscalar condensate is given by

a(x)a(x) 

(1)x

(1,x1,x + 2,x2,x  1)

a nonvanishing value of the lattice chiral condensate is due to the coupling  induced by the lattice
gauge eld  between the right and left fermions. this is the relic in the lattice of the ua(1)
anomaly in the continuum theory.

7 lattice versus continuum

we now want to compare our lattice results with the exact results of the continuum model; to do
this, one should extrapolate the strong-coupling expansion derived under the assumption that the
parameter z = 2 = t2
la4  1 to the region in which z  1; this corresponds to take the continuum
e4
la4  0 when z  . to make the extrapolation possible, it is customary to make
limit since e4
use of pade approximants, which allow to extrapolate a series expansion beyond the convergence
radius. strong-coupling perturbation theory improved by pade approximants should then provide
results consistent with the continuum theory. as we shall see the strong-coupling expansion derived
in this paper provides accurate estimates of the meson masses, already at the rst order in powers
of z.

let us now evaluate ms and the lattice light velocity t. we rst compute the ratio between the
 ec and the lattice coupling constant el by equating

continuum value of the meson mass ms =q 2

the lattice chiral condensate, eq.(6.118), to its continuum counterpart eq.(6.110)

a2 (0.0866  0.4043z) = (

)2m2

s .

(7.119)

eq.(7.119) is true only when pade approximants are used since, as it stands, the left hand side
holds only for z  1, while the right-hand side provides the value of the chiral condensate to be
obtained when z = . using

one gets from eq.(7.119)

as in refs.[3, 4], due to the factor z
2 , the second power of eq.(7.121) should be considered in
order to construct a non diagonal pade approximant. since the strong coupling expansion has been
carried out up to second order in z, one is allowed to construct only the [0, 1] pade approximant
for the polynomial written in eq.(7.121). one gets

(7.129)

and lies 19% above the exact value. putting this value of t in eq.(7.123) or eq.(7.128) one gets

(7.130)

which lies 37% above the exact value q 2

 . it is comforting to see that the lattice reproduces in a
sensible way the continuum results even if we use just rst order (in z) results of the strong coupling
perturbation theory.

using the value of t given in eq.(7.129) one gets for the isotriplet mass eq.(7.135)

mt

by direct computation on an 8 sites chain one gets

mt

(7.131)

(7.132)

the discrepancy between eq.(7.131) and eq.(7.132) is mainly due to the approximation involved
in the computation of < g.s.|~v 2|g.s. >. however, it is safe to believe that our lattice computation
implies the existence of a massive isotriplet 1+ with a mass between the lower bound (7.131) and

16

the upper bound (7.132). this is in agreement with the results provided for the continuum theory
in [21].

using a similar procedure one may also compute the mass of the triplet 1+. from eq.(5.94)

one gets

mt 5
el

= 1.3347 .

(7.133)

this triplet, being g-odd, is a scattering state of a 0 singlet with a 1+ triplet, which are the
fundamental excitations of the system. the mass of this 1+ triplet should be larger than the mass
of the massive 1+ triplet, which should be a scattering state of massless 1+ triplets.

the lattice mass spectrum gets closer to its continuum

mt

(7.134)

(7.135)

eq.(7.134) provides a value of the isosinglet mass lying 24% above the exact answer. again the
triplet mass is reproduced with lesser accuracy due to the random phase approximation used in the
computation of the pertinent correlator; a better answer is given however by a direct computation
on the 8 sites chain yielding the value 1.2346 for mt /el.

8 concluding remarks

in this paper we used the correspondence between the 2-avor strongly coupled lattice schwinger
model and the antiferromagnetic heisenberg hamiltonian established in [6] to investigate the spec-
trum of the gauge model. using the analysis of the excitations of the nite size chains given in the
appendix, we showed the equality of the quantum numbers of the states of the heisenberg model
and the low-lying excitations of the 2-avor schwinger model. we provided also the spectrum of
the massive excitations of the gauge model; in order to extract numerical values for the masses,
we explicitly computed the pertinent spin-spin correlators of the heisenberg chain. although the
spectrum is determined only up to the second order in the strong coupling expansion the agreement
with the continuum theory is satisfactory.

the massless and the massive excitations of the gauge model are created from the spin chain
ground state with two very dierent mechanisms: massless excitations involve only spin ipping
while massive excitations are created by fermion transport besides spin ipping and do not belong to
the spin chain spectrum. as in the continuum theory, due to the coleman theorem [20], the massless
excitations are not goldstone bosons, but may be regarded as the gapless quantum excitations of
the spin- 1

2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain [35].

in computing the chiral condensate we showed that, also in the lattice theory, the expectation
value of the umklapp operator f is dierent from zero, while both <  > and < a > are
zero to every order in the strong coupling expansion. this implies that both on the lattice and the
continuum the su (2) avor symmetry is preserved whereas the ua(1) axial symmetry is broken.
the umklapp operator f is the order parameter for this symmetry, but being quadri-linear in the
fermi elds, is invariant, in the continuum, under chiral rotation of /2 and on the lattice under the
corresponding discrete axial symmetry (2.30) (translation by one lattice site). this shows that the
discrete axial symmetry is not broken in both cases. our lattice computation enhance this result
since the ground state of the strongly coupled 2-avor schwinger model is translationally invariant.

the pattern of symmetry breaking of the continuum is exactly reproduced even if the coleman
theorem does not apply on the lattice and the anomalous symmetry breaking is impossible due to
the nielsen-ninomiya [38] theorem. at variance with the strongly coupled 1-avor lattice schwinger
model, the anomaly is not realized in the lattice theory via the spontaneous breaking of a residual

17

chiral symmetry [4], but, rather, by explicit breaking of the chiral symmetry due to staggered
fermions. the non-vanishing of < f > may be regarded as the only relic, in the strongly coupled
lattice theory, of the anomaly of the continuum 2-avor schwinger model. it is due to the coupling
induced by the gauge eld, between the right and left-movers on the lattice.

it is quite straightforward to generalize our analysis to an su (n )-avor group. for this, one
should observe [9] that the results are very dierent depending on if n is even or odd. when n is
odd, the ground state energy  in the strong coupling limit  is proportional to e2 but, when n is
even, the ground state energy is of order 1. this dierence arises since, on the lattice, the charge
density operator is odd under charge conjugation; therefore, the constant n2 should be subtracted
from the charge density operator [9]. as a consequence, when n is odd, the ground state supports
electric uxes while this becomes impossible when n is even.

when the fermion mass m is dierent from zero, some further dierence arises between n odd
and n even. when n is odd, the mass term induces a translational non invariant ground state,
generating a spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. when n is even, the ground state remains
translationally invariant in the strong coupling limit, i.e. e2  m.
in the weak coupling limit,
m  e2, the discrete chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken for every n . for n = 2, the
soliton-antisoliton excitations [20] acquire a mass.

appendix a:
exact diagonalization of nite size antiferromagnetic heisen-
berg chains

in the following we shall provide the exact diagonalization of the heisenberg antiferromagnetic
model for nite size chains of n = 4, 6 and 8 sites and compare the results with the bethe ansatz
solution provided in [14]. in order to make our arguments self-contained, we shall outline the steps
involved in deriving the exact solution in the thermodynamic limit. we shall show that already very
small nite size chains exhibit spectra that match very well with the thermodynamic limit solution.
furthermore the analysis of nite size chains is very useful since it allows the comparison between
the quantum numbers of the schwinger and the heisenberg model excitations. the interested reader
may also look up references [14, 36, 29].

the one dimensional isotropic heisenberg model describes a system of n interacting spin- 1

(8.137)

they act nontrivially only on the hilbert space of the xth site. periodic boundary conditions are
assumed.

the hamiltonian (8.136) is invariant under global rotations in the spin space, generated by

due to the periodic boundary conditions, under translations generated by the operator t ,

the hamiltonian is invariant and [~s, t ] = 0.

in order for em and pm to be eigenvalues of the hamiltonian and momentum operator. see [14]
for a derivation of eqs.(8.142).

the solution of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain is reduced to the solution of the system
of the m algebraic equations (8.142). this, in general, is not an easy task. it can be shown [14],
however, that, in the thermodynamic limit n  , the complex parameters  have the form

l = j,l + il

,

l = l,l + 1, . . . , l  1, l;

(8.143)

where l is a non-negative integer or half-integer, i,l is the real part of the solution of (8.142)
and we shall dene shortly the set of allowed values for the integer index j. the s that, for a
given j,l, are obtained varying l between [l, l] by integer steps, form a string of length 2l + 1,
see g.(1). this arrangement of s in the complex plane is called the string hypothesis [14]. in
the following we shall verify that, even on nite size systems, the string hypothesis is very well
fullled.

in a generic bethe state with m spins down, there are m solutions to (8.142), which can be
grouped according to the length of their strings. let us denote by l the number of strings of
length 2l + 1, l = 0, 1
2 , . . .; strings of the same length are obtained by changing the real parts, j,l,
of the s in (8.143); as a consequence
j = 1, . . . , l. if one denotes the total number of strings
by q one has

q =xl

l , m =xl

(2l + 1)l .

(8.144)

the set of integers (m, q,{l}) constrained by (8.144), characterizes bethe states up to the
xing of the q numbers j,l; this set is called the conguration. varying m , q and l, one is
able to construct all the 2n eigenstates of an heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain of n sites [14].
the energy and momentum of the bethes state, corresponding to a given conguration  within
exponential accuracy as n    consist of q summands representing the energy and momentum
of separate strings. for the parameters j,l of the given conguration, taking the logarithm of
(8.142) the following system of equations is obtained in the thermodynamic limit

integer and half integer numbers qj,l parametrize the branches of the arcotangents and, conse-
quently, the possible solutions of the system of eqs.(8.145). in ref.[14] it was shown that the qj,l
are limited as

(8.148)

(8.149)

.

the admissible values for the numbers qj,l are called the vacancies and their number for every
l is denoted by pl

pl = 2qmax

l + 1 .

(8.150)

the main hypothesis formulated in [14] is that to every admissible collection of qj,l there
corresponds a unique solution of the system of equations (8.145). the solution always provides, in
a multiplet, the state with the highest value of the third spin component s3.

let us now consider some simple example. the simplest conguration has only strings of length

1, i.e. all the s are real. the singlet associated to this conguration

m = q = 0 =

n
2

,

l = 0 , l > 0

,

(8.151)

is the ground state. the vacancies of the strings of length 1, i.e. the admissible values of qj,0, due
to eqs.(8.147,8.148,8.149), belong to the segment

n

+

1
2  qj,0 

n

.

20

(8.152)

therefore they are n/2. all these vacancies must then be used to nd the n/2 strings of length 1.
as a consequence this state is uniquely specied and no degeneracy is possible.

next we consider the conguration that provides a singlet with 1 string of length 2 and all the

others of length 1:

m =

n
2

,

q =

n
2  1

,

0 =

n
2  2 ,

 1

2

= 1

,

l = 0

, l >

1
2

.

(8.153)

for the strings of length 1 the number of vacancies is again n/2; for the string of length 2 there is
one vacancy and the only admissible qj,1 equals 0. thus, since the number of strings of length 1 is
0 = n
2  2, there are two vacancies for which eqs.(8.145) have no solution; they are called holes
and are denoted q(h)
2 . this conguration is determined by two parameters: the positions
of two holes which vary independently in the interval (8.152).

and q(h)

1

there is another state with only 2 holes: the triplet corresponding to the conguration

m = q = 0 =

n
2  1

,

l = 0

, l > 0

(8.154)

the number of vacancies for the strings of length 1 equals n

2 + 1, while 0 = n

2  1.

the excitations determined by the congurations (8.153,8.154) belong to the conguration class
called in [14] maf . the class maf is characterized as follows: the number of strings of length
1 in each conguration belonging to this class diers by a nite quantity from n/2, 0 = n
2  k0
where k0 is a positive nite constant, so that the number of strings of length greater than 1 is nite.
from (8.150) we then have

p0 =

n
2

+ k0  2xl>0

l

pl = 2k0  2 xl>0

j(l, l)l , l > 0

so that

p0 

n
2

, pl < 2k0 , l > 0 .

(8.155)

(8.156)

(8.157)

from (8.155) follows that the number of holes for the strings of length 1 is always even and equals
2 only for the singlet and the triplet excitations discussed above. one can imagine the class maf
as a sea of strings of length 1 with a nite number of strings of length greater than 1 immersed
into it. it was proven in [14] that, in the thermodynamic limit, the states belonging to maf have
nite energy and momentum with respect to the antiferromagnetic vacuum, whereas each of the
states which corresponds to a conguration not included in the class maf has an innite energy
relative to the antiferromagnetic vacuum.

let us now sketch the computation of the thermodynamic limit ground state energy. eqs.(8.145)

for the ground state have the form

to summarize, the nite energy excitations of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain are only
those belonging to the class maf and are described by scattering states of an even number of
quasiparticles or kinks. the momentum p of these kinks runs over half the brillouin zone  
p  0, the dispersion relation is (p) = j
2 sin p, eq.(8.175), and the spin of a kink is 1/2. the
singlet and the triplet excitations described above are the only states composed of two kinks, the
spins of the kinks being parallel for the triplet and antiparallel for the singlet. for vanishing total
momentum all the states belonging to maf have the same energy of the ground state so that they
are gapless excitations. since the eigenstates of hj always contain an even number of kinks, the
dispersion relation is determined by a a set of two-parameters: the momenta of the even number of
kinks whose scattering provides the excitation. there are no bound states of kinks.

let us now turn to the computation of the spectrum of nite size quantum antiferromagnetic
chains by exact diagonalization. we shall see that already for very small chains, the spectrum is
well described by the bethe ansatz solution in the thermodynamic limit. furthermore, an intuitive
picture of the ground state and of the lowest lying excitations of the strongly coupled 2-avor lattice
schwinger model emerges.

the states of an antiferromagnetic chain are classied according to the quantum numbers of
spin, third spin component, energy and momentum |s, s3, e, p >. for a 4 site chain the momenta
allowed for the states are: 0, 

2 mod 2. the ground state is

|g.s. >= |0, 0,3j, 0 >=

(2| > +2| > | > | > | > | >)

.

(8.186)
this state is p -parity even. in fact, by the denition of p -parity given in eq.(2.29), the p -parity
inverted state (8.186) is obtained by reverting the order of the spins in each vector | . . . > appearing
in (8.186), e.g. | > p | >.

it is p -even, so that it is a sp = 0+ excitation, with the same quantum numbers (the isospin is

among these, only the non-degenerate state with the lowest energy has a well dened p -parity
(8.189). it is a sp = 1 like the lowest lying triplet of the 2-avor strongly coupled schwinger
model. the degenerate states can be always combined to form a p -odd state.

we thus see that within the states in a given conguration there is always a representative state
with well dened parity, the others are degenerate and can be used to construct state of well dened
energy and parity. moreover the parity of the representative states (with respect to the parity of

24

the ground state) is the same of the one of the lowest-lying schwinger model excitations in strong
coupling.

all the triplets in (8.190) have one real  and two holes; they can be associated with the family
of triplets (8.154). in table (2) we summarize the triplet s and q(h)s. the spectrum exhibits also

let us analize the spectrum of the 6 site antiferromagnetic chain. the momenta allowed for the

states are now 0,

this state is odd under p -parity. the spectrum of the six sites chain is reported in g.(3). there
are 9 triplets in the spectrum. in [37] it was already pointed out that the number of lowest lying
triplets for a nite system with n sites is n (n + 2)/8, so for n = 6 there are 6 lowest lying triplet
states. in order to identify these 6 states among the 9 that are exhibited by the spectrum of g.(3),
it is necessary to compute their s and their qs. in this way in fact, we can nd out which are the
triplets characterized by two holes and thus belonging to the triplet of type (8.154). in table (3) we
report the internal quantum numbers of the lowest lying triplets. the q(h)s vary in the segment
[ 3

2 ]. the highest weight state of the triplet of zero momentum and energy (j/2)(5 +5) reads

one can get the triplet of energy (j/2)(5  5) from (8.193) by changing 5  5. as can

be explicitly checked from (8.193), the two non-degenerate triplets of zero momentum are then
p -parity even, namely they have opposite parity with respect to that of the ground state, as it
happens for the lowest lying triplet excitations of the 2-avor schwinger model. for what concerns
the degenerate triplets of momenta /3 and 5/3 (or 2/3 and 4/3) they do not have denite
p -parity, but it is always possible to take a linear combination of them with parity opposite to the
ground state.

the remaining three triplets in g.(3) have no real s and are characterized by a string of length
2 and four holes for q =  3
2 , i.e. do not belong to the type (8.154). more precisely, two
triplets have a string approximately of length 2, due to the nite size of the system, while the triplet
of momentum  has a string exactly of length 2. in table (4) we summarize the quantum numbers
of these triplets.

in g.(3) it is shown that the spectrum exhibits ve singlet states. the lowest lying state
at momentum  is the ground state. then there are three excited singlets characterized by the
conguration with two holes (8.153), i.e. they have one real  and a string of length almost 2.
in table (5) we summarize their quantum numbers. among these singlets, those which are not
degenerate, have p -parity equal to that of the ground state (odd) as it happens in the 2-avor
schwinger model. the non-degenerate singlet in fact reads

|0, 0,3j, 0 > =

1
12{| > +| > +| > +| > +| > +| >

.(8.194)

the degenerate singlets are again not eigenstates of the p -parity, but it is always possible to take a
linear combination of them with the a p -parity that coincides with that of the representative state
(8.194) of the conguration.

have the same number of domain walls, which ranges from n , for the two neel states, to 2 for the

appendix b: the correlator g(2) in terms of spin congura-
tion probabilities

in this appendix we shall establish a relation between the heisenberg model correlator g(2)
and the probabilities of nding, in the antiferromagnetic vacuum, certain groups of spin in a given
position.

the isotropy of the heisenberg model implies that

n

xx=1

< g.s.|s3

x  s3

x+2|g.s. > .

(8.212)

let us introduce the probability p3 for nding three adjacent spins in a given position in the
heisenberg antiferromagnetic vacuum. taking advantage of the isotropy of the heisenberg model
ground state and of its translational invariance, it is easy to see that the correlator (8.212) can be
written in terms of the p3s as

< g.s.|s3

x  s3

x+2|g.s >= n

2 ( p3() + p3()  p3()  p3() )

.

(8.213)

n

xx=1

the factor 2 appears in (8.213) due again to the isotropy of the heisenberg model: the probability
of a conguration and of the conguration rotated by  around the chain axis, are the same.

in [18] the so called emptiness formation probability p (x) was introduced.

where

p (x) =< g.s.|

pj =

(8.214)

(8.215)

j is the pauli matrix. p (x) determines the probability of nding x adjacent spins up in the

and 3
antiferromagnetic vacuum. one gets

p () = p (3)
p () = p (1)  2p (2) + p (3)
p () = p () = p (2)  p (3)

.

(8.219)

using the exact value the correlator g(2) computed in [17] from (8.219) and from the known values

p (1) =

for the general emptiness formation probability p (x) of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain,
an integral representation was given in [18], but, to our knowledge, the exact value of p (3) (8.223)
was not known.
