abstract

we provide explicit examples of supersymmetric domain walls of a ve-
dimensional simple, n=2 u(1) gauged supergravity theory constructed by gu-
naydin, townsend and sierra. these conformally at solutions interpolate be-
tween supersymmetric isolated anti-desitter vacua, satisfy the killing spinor (rst
order) dierential equations, have the energy density related to the cosmological
constants of the isolated supersymmetric vacua, and the four-dimensional world
on the domain wall is a at world with n=1 supersymmetry. an analysis of
such solutions is given for the example of one (real, neutral) vector supermul-
tiplet with the most general form of the prepotential. as the gauge coupling
becomes very large (compared to ve-dimensional planck constant), these do-
main walls become innitely thin, and a special case of a z2 symmetric domain
wall is a supersymmetric realization of the static domain wall solution considered
by randall and sundrum.

1 introduction

the past few months have witnessed exciting progress in the study of domain walls in
d=5 gravity theories. such congurations are interesting from two, on a surface or-
thogonal perspectives: (i) in the context of ads/cft correspondence such conformally
at congurations provide new insights in the study of rge ows [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
and (ii) in the context of phenomenological implications, such congurations provide
a framework [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] to address the physics implications of large
dimensions for the four-dimensional world on the domain wall.

within the rst approach a number of conformally at solutions were constructed
and in particular the ones interpolating between supersymmetric anti-desitter (ads)
vacua of n=8 d=5 gauged theory provide examples of static domain walls in d=5
with implications for the renormalization group ow and spectra in strongly coupled
four-dimensional super yang-mills theories. one such example [2, 5] involves two scalar
elds and thus was solved numerically and another most recent example with one scalar
eld can be solved explicitly [17].

within the second approach innitely thin, static, z2-symmetric domain wall solutions
were constructed [11, 12] for pure ads gravity theory. (generalizations that incorpo-
rate eects of additional compactied dimensions were given in [13, 15, 16].) these
solutions have to satisfy a specic relation between the domain wall tension  and the
cosmological constant  of the ads vacua, thus implying a ne-tuning.

the purpose of this letter is few-fold. we shall provide explicit examples of supersym-
metric (bps-saturated) domain walls in ve-dimensions, in the simplest supergravity
theory, i.e. the supergravity theory with least supersymmetry that allows for the ex-
plicit constructions of supersymmetric domain wall congurations. in order to demon-
strate the existence of domain wall solutions in this framework, such a supergravity
theory necessarily has to have a potential for (gauge neutral) scalar elds, and the
only known such examples are gauged supergravity theories. we thus choose to work
within a framework of a ve-dimensional n=2, u(1) gauged supergravity formulated
by gunaydin, townsend and sierra [18] 3. for the sake of concreteness we shall analyse
the case with one physical (gauge neutral) vector supereld which allows for an explicit
analysis of the possible domain wall congurations. for this simple model, kink solu-
tions have been discussed some time ago [19]; the domain walls presented in this paper
provide a concrete and explicit realisation of supersymmetric kink solutions.

the important upshot of the analysis is that this framework does provide examples of
static domain walls, i.e. conformally at solutions interpolating between isolated super-
symmetric vacua with (non-positive) cosmological constants. those are bps-saturated
congurations that satisfy the killing spinor (rst order) dierential equations and
whose energy density  is related in a specic manner to cosmological constants of

3such a theory may have its origin as a compactication of type iib superstring theory on a specic
einstein-sasaki-5-manifolds or as a compactication of m-theory on calabi-yau with non-trivial uxes
turned on. but the details are unknown so far and remain to be worked out.

the isolated supersymmetric vacua on each side of the wall. namely, the relationship
between the domain wall tension and the cosmological constant is a consequence of the
bps nature of the solution, and not an artifact of ne-tuning 4. these congurations
have four unbroken supercharges, or in other words break 1
2 of n=2, d=5 supersymme-
try, and thus the four-dimensional world on the domain wall has n=1 supersymmetry.
a special example of innitely thin bps domain walls (corresponding to the case of
very large gauge coupling) and with z2 symmetry corresponds to a concrete supersym-
metric realization of the static domain wall solution found by randall and sundrum
[11].

2 d=5 n=2 u(1) gauged supergravity

supergravity in d=5 is very restrictive with respect to allowed potentials. the only
allowed potentials come from gauging of isometries and especially interesting are poten-
tials that have no run-away behavior (scalars become asymptotically constant) with
non-trivial isolated extrema. this type of potential allows for the existence of domain
walls with extrema corresponding to the ads vacua on each side of the wall. the min-
imal gauged supergravity (n=2 gauged supergravity with u(1) gauged r-symmetry),
constructed in [18, 22], provides such a set-up. in this case one can consistently decou-
ple the hyper-multiplets and the lagrangian contains only the supergravity multiplet
and the vector supermultiplets. (there are also domain wall solutions, that couple to
non-trivial hypermultiplets [23], but they do not have asymptotic anti-de sitter spaces.)
in this case the bosonic lagrangian reads:

s5 = z h1

we chose the convention where the ve-dimensional newtons constant is  = 1 and g
is the gauge coupling. we work in the (, +, +, +, +) convention. the physical scalars
a, which are real and neutral, correspond to the scalar components of the vector
super-multiplets and dene coordinates of the manifold dened by [18]

f =

with cijk real, and the x i are the auxiliary real scalar elds. the metric(s) of the
scalar manifold gab (for physical scalars a) and gij (for auxiliary scalars x i) are
dened by

dimensional n=1 supergravity theory found in [20] and reviewed in [21].

notice, w is subject to the constraint (2) which makes it non-linear in the physical
scalars a.

supersymmetry transformations and bps-saturated domain
walls

we are searching for supersymmetric (bps) domain wall solutions: those are solutions
that preserve part of the supersymmetry, and thus satisfy the killing spinor equa-
tions, which are rst order dierential equations what ensure that the supersymmetry
transformations in this domain wall background are preserved.

we chose these domain wall solutions to be neutral, and thus they are supported only
by (gauge neutral) scalars with the gauge elds turned o. thus, the supersymmetry
transformations for these backgounds read: [18]

2gabb + i 3

2 gaw(cid:17) ,

a = (cid:16)  i
 = (cid:16) + 1

4ab

 ab + 1

2g w(cid:17) .

(6)

the vacuum is given by the asymptotic space, where the scalars are constant and
thus supersymmetry requires aw = 0. the form of the potential v (4) implies that
supersymmetric vacua are always extrema of the potential.

the domain wall ansatz for the metric is of the form:

ds2 = a(z)h  dt2 + dx2

1 + dx2

2 + dx2

3i + dz2 ,

(7)

and the scalars have the form a = a(z), where z = {, +} is a direction
transverse to the wall.

5note the parallels with the potential in d=4 n=1 supergravity where: v = ek(cid:16)ga bdaw dbw 

3|w|2(cid:17) where w and k are the superpotential and kahler potential for the chiral superelds.

4

then the killing spinor equations  = 0 and a = 0 are solved by 6:

z log a = 2gw ,

(8)

and

za = 3ggabbw ,

(9)
where the four component spinor satises the constraint: z = . (killing spinor
equations for domain walls of d=5, n=8 supergravity can be cast in a similar form [5].)
note that as long as the domain of physical elds contain two isolated supersymmetric
vacua, this set of solutions specify the bps domain wall. the physical domain of such
solutions requires that the scalar metric gab remains positive denite.
the domain wall tension can be determined by applying nesters procedure which
relates the wall tension  to the central charge of the supersymmetry algebra; the
central charge is determined by the values of the superpotential at each asymptotically
supersymmetric vacuum. (for d=4 n=1 domain wall solutions, see appendix a of
[20].) more concretely, one considers the integral over the spatial boundary

z

n d = z n  d = z n 0d0 .

(10)

here we used the stokes theorem.  is a spece-like hypersurface and thus d0  dzd~x.
the nester tensor reads n  =  where  is the gravitino variation. in order
to determine the energy density, we can factor out the integral over the domain wall
coordinates (d~x) and the integration over the transverse direction (z) yields in (10)
the contributions far away from the wall. inserting the gravitino variation in (10), one
obtains two contributions, the rst one represents the domain wall tension  (energy
density) and the second one corresponds to the central charge c. the latter one is
a topological term that corresponds to the dierence of the boundary values of the
superpotential. for the supersymmetric conguration the gravitino variation is zero,
and thus (10) is zero which implies:

where we used the projector z = . (in the killing spinor equations and (11 we
chose w (a|z=  w (a|z=+. the reversal of this inequality implies the change of
signs in the killing spinor equations, (11) and z = .)
normalizing the killing spinor as (0a) = 1, yields the result is:

where w  w (a|z=). in the second part of (12) we have used the relationship
between the cosmological constant  and the value of the superpotential w for super-
symmetric vacua. note that  is determined by sign[w+w]. thus, the domain
wall tension is specied by the values of the cosmological constants of the asymptotic
ads vacua. according to (12) there are three types of bps-saturated domain walls
(very much parallel to the analysis of the types of bps-saturated domain walls in d=4
[25], their global space-time structure [26] and their relationship to non-supersymmetric
congurations [27]):

 type i domain walls interpolate supersymmetric minkowski space-time ( =
.
0) and the ads space time (+   6= 0).
these walls saturate an analog of the coleman-deluccia bound [28] in ve di-
mensions. on the asymptotic ads side the metric coecient takes the form
3  z; on the ads side of the wall z   limit corresponds to the
ads horizon. the geodesic extension of these space-times could either be pure
ads or new regions that involve an innite tiling with the mirror domain walls.

a(z) = e 2

in this case bp s = 1

126

 type ii domain walls interpolate between supersymmetric ads vacua where
126(cid:16)+ + (cid:17), and
sign[w] = sign[w+] and thus bp s = 1
the asymptotic metric behaves as a(z) = e 2
3  |z|; on each side of the walls
z   limits correspond to the ads horizons and thus the geodesic extensions
could be either pure ads or new regions that comprise of an innite tiling with
the mirror domain walls. (these domain walls can be viewed as stable; non-
supersymmetric generalizations are expanding bubbles on either side of the ads
vacua [24].) a special case of a z2 symmetric solution (w+ = w) satises
the constraint: bp s = 1
66

 which is a relationship found in [11].
+(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

 type iii domain walls are those between two supersymmetric ads vacua where
126(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
sign[w] = +sign[w+] and thus bp s = 1
. the metric
coecient grows exponentially on one side of the wall: a(z) = e+min[ 2
3 ] |z|,
and thus on this side, |z|   limit corresponds to the boundary of the ads
space! (those are the unstable domain wall solutions whose non-supersymmetric
generalizations corresponds to false vacuum decay bubbles, only [24].)

3 bps domain walls with one vector supermul-

tiplet

for the sake of being explicit we will address the case of a single vector multiplet.
dening the physical scalar as  = x 1/x 0 the constraint (2) takes the form:

f = (x 0)3 (a + b + c2 + d3) = 1 ,

(13)

6

and the superpotential (5)becomes:

(14)
where x 0 is the auxiliary eld eliminated by eq. (13). the metric g, and the derivative
of the potential w take the form:

w = x 0(h0 + h1) .

and the potential reads:

(15)

(16)

(17)

one can make the following general observations about the nature of supersymmetric
vacua. (i) the superpotential (14) allows for at most two extrema, where w = 0. (ii)
expanding w around a given extremum yields: 2
3 g w|extr (see e.g., [6]).
this relationship implies that for physical solutions with g > 0 , the two extrema
of w cannot be connected unless there is at least one pole between them. thus,
the supersymmetric domain wall solution necessarily involves a jump over a region
where the superpotential (as well as the scalar metric and the potential) have a pole.
as we shall see shortly such poles are suciently mild that the domain wall solutions,
analyzed in the previous section exist and the domain wall tension is nite. (note,
these lines of arguments hold only for the one-scalar case. if w depends on more than
one scalar, it may allow for two minima, which can be smoothly connected.)

w|extr = 2

in order to discuss the solution in more detail we choose, without loss of generality,
the following parameterization:

g = 1,

a = 0 , b = d = h0 = 1 , c = 3 ,

h1 = 3 .

(18)

(one can show that g = d = h0 = 1 corresponds to an overall rescaling of the
potential, a = 0 can be obtained by shifts     0 and h0  h0 + h10, and b = 1
corresponds to a rescaling of .) in this case the metric, superpotential and its derivate
can be written in the following form:

g =

3(2  1)2 + 3 + 1
32(1 + 3 + 2)2

1 + 3

the corresponding killing spinor equations for the metric coecient a(z) is given in
(8) and that for the scalar eld (9) takes the form:
gz = 3 w .

(22)

7

features of the solutions and an example

the rst useful observation is that in the region where the metric g has real poles,
g has no real zeroes. namely, the poles and zeros are at the following values of :

(23)

(24)

poles of g : { 1

2(3  32  4), 0} ,

zeroes for g :   32 + 4
23(2  1)

.

thus for 2 > 4/3 there are no zeroes of the metric, but there are poles for the values
of  specied by (23).

supersymmetric vacua are determined by zeroes of w (21). as discussed at the
beginning of this section, there are at most two, and there  takes the value:

zeroes for w :

(  )  2   + 2  1

3(  1)

.

(25)

note also that the poles of w , w and g are identical.
for the parameter range 2 < 4
3, w has no poles and thus, due to the relationship
w|extr = 2
2
3 g w|extr, one extremum has to be a maximum and the other one a mini-
mum. therefore, the scalar metric g is negative for one value of (25) and corresponds
to a non-physical vacuum ( is a tachyon there).
thus the only physical region for the domain wall solutions corresponds to 2 > 4
3. now
the scalar metric g is always positive denite and w has two real extrema which are
necessarily separated by at least one pole. thus the domain wall interpolating between
such supersymmetric extrema corresponds to a kink solution that goes over the region
where the potential blows-up mildly. near the pole the killing spinor equations (8) and
(9) can be solved approximately: instead of a typical kink behavior pole  (zzpole)
(in the case of a nite potential) now the kink slows-down and behaves near the pole
as   pole  (z  zpole)3 and the metric coecient behaves as 7 a(z)  (z  zpole)2c
where c depends on the pole-value of . it is negative for  > 1
3(1) and positive for
 < 1
typically one encounters type ii domain wall solutions, i.e. sign[w+] = sign[w],
and at least one pole in-between. (further details will be given elsewhere [24].) for
the sake of concreteness we exhibit a numerical solution for  = 1.4,  = 0.6 with the
two supersymmetric minima (25) at {1.0887,0.1664} sandwiched between the pole
in the middle (poles (23) are at {1.8980,0.5269, 0}). this solution is close to a z2
symmetric solution; w| = 2.6944 and w|+ = 2.4953. notice the slow-down
of the kink solution (z) and a power-law spike of the metric a(z) in the middle of
the wall.

3(1) .

7note that the energy density contributing to the domain wall tension is nite and thus the

nesters procedure for the derivation of bp s (which employs stokes theorem) remains applicable.

down of the kink and a spike of the metric coecient a(z) in the region in the
middle of the wall.

4 conclusions

the specic realization of supersymmetric domain walls in the simplest ve-dimensional
supergravity demonstrates a number of interesting features. the superpotential w as
a function of a single scalar can have at most two extrema, but there is no smooth
ow possible while demanding that the scalar metric remains positive (g > 0). two
ads vacua with positive scalar metric have to be separated by a pole in the superpo-
tential and the corresponding domain wall represents a supergravity kink solution that
interpolates between the two branches. despite this singularity, a stable kink solution
exists (with the scalar eld slowing-down mildly in the region crossing the pole) and
the energy density, as calculated by nesters procedure, is nite and given by the sum
or dierence (depending on the relative signs of w ) of the asymptotic cosmological
constants.

as for particle phenomenology, we have claried an important connection between the
domain wall tension and the cosmological constants of isolated d=5 string vacua. as a
by product we see that the domain wall world is at and is supersymmetric, i.e. along
with the massless graviton there is an accompanying gravitino. the hypermultiplets of
d=5 gauged supergravity could potentially play a role of matter on the domain wall,
a subject of further investigations.

we conclude with another note, that the break-down of supersymmetry (by either of
the vacua) would ensure that the non-extreme walls would become expanding bubbles

9

(see the analysis given in for non-supersymmetric domain walls in d=4 in [27] and for
a somewhat related analysis in d=5 in [29].)

could it be that the four-dimensional world is indeed a domain wall world of gauged
supergravity theory?
