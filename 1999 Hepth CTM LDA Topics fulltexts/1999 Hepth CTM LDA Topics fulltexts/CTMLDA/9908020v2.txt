the series of perturbative uctuations around a multi-instanton contribution to a

specic class of correlation functions of supercurrents in n = 4 supersymmetric su (n )

yangmills theory is examined in the light of the ads/cft correspondence. subject to

certain plausible assumptions, we argue that a given term in the 1/n expansion in such

a background receives only a nite number of perturbative corrections in the t hooft

limit. such instanton non-renormalisation theorems would explain, for example, the exact

agreement of certain weak coupling yangmills instanton calculations with the strong

coupling predictions arising from d-instanton eects in string theory amplitudes. these

non-renormalisation theorems essentially follow from the assumption of a well dened
derivative () expansion in the string theory dual of the yangmills theory.

1. introduction

the conjectured equivalence of type iib superstring theory on ads5  s5 to the
boundary n = 4 supersymmetric su (n ) yangmills conformal eld theory [1,2,3] has

been tested by a variety of calculations at leading order in the large-n limit and at large
values of the t hooft coupling,  = g2

y m is the yangmills coupling constant).
many of these tests, such as those of certain two and three point correlation functions, have

y m n/4 (g2

relied on non-renormalisation theorems/conjectures [4] and therefore allow the meaningful

comparison of the regimes of strong and weak t hooft coupling.

clearly, the ideal way of developing the ads/cft correspondence beyond the lim-

ited large  region in which it has so far been studied would be to explicitly quantize
iib superstring theory in an ads5  s5 background. unfortunately, this is a daunting
problem, even at tree level  in part because of the presence of a nonzero condensate of

r  r background elds associated with the nonzero f5 ux. in the absence of an explicit
construction of string amplitudes most concrete calculations have made use of known low

order terms in the expansion of the eective supergravity action in powers of the dimen-
sionless parameter /l2 (l is the size of the ads5 and s5 background and 1/2 is the
string distance scale). in fact, knowing the complete eective action for the massless elds

of string theory would be sucient to compute the yang-mills correlation functions of the

relevant dual operators, but we are far from achieving this.

nevertheless, in the following we will show how some reasonable assumptions concern-

ing the structure of the low energy expansion of type iib string theory lead to a number

of non-renormalisation theorems in the instanton sector of certain yang-mills correlation

functions. to be concrete, we will consider the d-instanton contributions to the four gravi-

ton scattering amplitude and arrive at statements regarding the corresponding yang-mills

instanton terms in the ads/cft dual correlation functions of four energy-momentum ten-

sors. similar statements also apply to any of the yang-mills correlations functions that

are related by supersymmetry. specically, what we will see is that, for certain protected

parts of the correlation functions, the t hooft expansion around an instanton background

has only a nite number of perturbative terms in  at each order in 1/n . in particular, we

will see that at leading order in n only the -independent semi-classical term arises. this

would account for the precise agreement (for any instanton number k, at leading order in
n ) between the d-instanton contributions, at leading order in the  (or 1/) expansion [5],

with the semi-classical (small-) contributions of yangmills instantons [6,7]. in the case

1

of two and three point functions the space-time dependence is completely determined by

(super) conformal invariance. however, the matching of the string theory d-instanton and

yangmills instanton contributions to the protected correlation functions involves match-

ing non-trivial functions of the space-time positions (functions of two independent cross

ratios in the case of the correlator of four stress tensors), together with specic dependence

on n ,  and the instanton number.

1.1. overview of the correspondence

the ads/cft conjecture [1] gives a relation between the parameters of the string
theory  the dimensionless ads5  s5 scale l2/, the r  r scalar eld, c(0), and the
coupling constant g = e =  1
 and those of the yangmills theory with gauge group
su (n ).

(1.1)

where  is the constant axionic angle. this means that the constant value of the complex
coupling constant,   1 + i2 = c(0) + ie, in the ads5  s5 background is identied
with the complex yangmills coupling,

(1.2)

in the following,  will always be assumed to be equal to this constant value (mostly with
 1
2 << 1).

according to the prescription of [2,3] the amplitudes of the bulk superstring theory
in the ads5  s5 background with elds propagating to specied values at points on the
boundary are equivalent to correlation functions of composite operators in the boundary

yangmills theory. the boundary values of the bulk elds are interpreted as sources

coupling to the operators in the yangmills theory. collectively denoting the independent

cross ratios of the positions of the boundary elds by , the resulting amplitude for an

n-point function in the gauge theory can be written as a nite sum over contributions of

the form

hs

n(cid:18) 

l2 , , , (cid:19) an = hy m

(, n, , )an.

(1.3)

n

the right-hand side is just a rewriting in terms of the variables n ,  and  in which it

is natural to express the correlation functions of the yangmills theory. the nite sum

involves factors an which span an independent set of tensor structures consistent with

2

the space-time quantum numbers and symmetries of the n-point functions. moreover, the

ans all have a common factor, also dictated by symmetry (a function of the space-time
separations |xi  xj| ), which carries the dimension of the correlation function. therefore,

almost all the non-trivial information about the correlation functions really lie in the

functions hn.

in the following, we will be exclusively concerned with the large n limit of (1.3). the

expansion of gauge theory amplitudes in 1/n translates into a small g expansion in the

left-hand side of (1.3). the t hooft expansion of yangmills amplitudes takes the familiar

form (for convenience, we will drop the subscript n in much that follows),

here the second ellipsis includes yangmills instanton terms of the form e2|k| n

each coming with its series of uctuations. although these instanton terms are exponen-

tially suppressed they are uniquely specied by their phase. it is the structure of the t

hooft expansion of uctuations around a particular instanton background that we will

focus on in sec. 2.

in the correspondence with the dual string theory, the terms in (1.4) which are powers

of 1/n arise from perturbative string contributions with k being the world sheet genus.
the instanton terms which are suppressed by powers of en are non-perturbative and can

be identied with d-instanton contributions [8]. though the form of the 1/n expansion

in (1.4) was originally motivated by weakly coupled perturbation theory, the existence of

the dual string theory with the identications (1.1) implies such a form should apply for

all . in particular, we will exploit the existence of a well dened expansion for large 
that is dened by the  expansion of the string theory.

2. instanton non-renormalisation theorems

the instanton calculations in [6,7] involved correlation functions of various combi-

nations of the superconformal currents that make up a short (256 component) n = 4

supermultiplet. however, the general structure of interest to us does not depend on which

of these correlation functions is considered so we will focus on a specic tensor structure

in the correlation function of four stress tensors.

3

this particular tensor structure can be dened by its relation, via the ads/cft
correspondence, to the r4 term in the type iib eective action (where r denotes the

weyl curvature). this ten-dimensional term has the tensor structure

r4  tm1m8 tn1n8 rn1n2

m1m2    rn7n8

m7m8

(2.1)

with t being a standard eighth-rank tensor. we wish to consider the linearization of
the four curvatures around the ads5  s5 background, keeping only the polarisations in
the ads5 directions. the four-graviton scattering amplitude is expressed as a functional
of the boundary (s4) values of the graviton by attaching a spin-two bulk-to-boundary

propagator to each graviton leg in the linearized vertex. since the boundary graviton eld

is interpreted in the yangmills theory as the source for the stress tensor, this procedure

denes a particular tensor contribution to the correlation function of four stress tensors

[5] which can be expressed as

l2
  1/2

2 f (0,0)

1

(, )g1()a4.

(2.2)

the 1 dependence reects the fact that the r4 term is of order 3 relative to the
einsteinhilbert term. the function a4 has, in addition to the particular tensor structure

determined by the bulk-boundary correspondence described above, a factor of qi<j |xi 

xj| 8
of the boundary operators is contained in the function of the two independent cross-ratios

3 , which is xed by conformal invariance. the residual dependence on the positions

which has been denoted as g1(). explicit expressions for g1() in the case of closely
related four-point functions were obtained in [6,9]. the modular invariant function of the
(complex) string coupling, f (0,0)
fourier expansion in powers of e2i1 [8],

(, ), is a nonholomorphic eisenstein series that has the

here (k, 1) = pd|k d2. the k = 0 term contains the perturbative tree-level and one-

loop contributions while the k 6= 0 terms are d-instanton contributions. the leading

4

2 independent term in the charge-k d-instanton sector was found to agree with a weak
coupling yang-mills calculation in [7] (at least for the related sixteen-dilatino correlation

function).

more generally, in the ads5  s5 background there will be contributions proportional
to a4 which are of higher order in . these come from higher derivative terms in the
eective action and can be studied in a taylor expansion for small /l2,

the modular functions f (0,0)
that appear here, have been conjectured to be generalised
eisenstein functions [10,11]. in the ads5  s5 background with its constant ve-form eld
strength f5, these terms can give contributions proportional to a4. another class of terms
suggested in [12,13] involve derivatives acting on r4, which may also give nonzero contri-
butions  a4 in the ads5  s5 background. there might also be terms that contribute to
a4 that cannot be expressed in terms of a local ten-dimensional action.

what about the possibility of terms which are non-perturbative in , which are
? for small /l2, we

exponentially suppressed in the taylor expansion, such as el2/
understand terms of this type as coming from non-trivial saddle points of the world sheet

theory, namely world-sheet instantons. but there are no topologically non-trivial two-
cycles for the world-sheet to wrap in ads5  s5 so such terms cannot appear in the string
genus expansion.3 one might argue that this does not rule out el2/
contributions
associated with non-perturbative  dependence. but this also seems unlikely since we

understand such non-perturbative terms as coming from d-instantons and again there is

no obvious origin for world-sheet instanton contributions in a d-instanton background.

we will therefore make the ansatz that (2.4) is the complete expression for the coecient

of a4 in the correlation function of four energy-momentum tensors, at least for sucently

3

in other instances of large n gauge theories dual to closed strings, world sheet instantons

are present and play an important role [14].

5

small /l2. in practice, we will only need the weaker assumption that this is so for the d-
instanton contributions to (2.4) (the terms with phases e2ik1, |k|  1). our arguments

will show that this assumption is, at least, self consistent.

the sl(2, z) duality symmetry of the iib theory is related via the ads/cft corre-

spondence to the montonenolive duality of n = 4 supersymmetric yangmills theory.

this requires that fl(,  , ) has specic modular properties which means that it has the
form,

fl(, , ) = 

1 l
2 hl(, , )

2

(2.6)

2

where hl(, , ) is modular invariant (a scalar under sl(2, z)). the explicit power of

arises from the transformation in the eective action from the string to the einstein

1 l
2
frame (where the metric is sl(2, z) neutral) due to the factors of the metric appearing
with the powers of /l2. in terms of yang-mills variables, this is easy to see since the

coecient of hl in (2.4) is the combination (from (2.4) and (2.6))

(2.7)

which is inert under sl(2, z).

now consider the non-perturbative part of the modular function hl(, , ) coming
from bps charge-k d-instantons. this amounts to picking out the saddle point (when
g =  1
2 << 1) with the exponential e2(ik1|k|2) dependence.4 we expect this to take
the generic form,

hl(,  , )|k = d(k, l)e2(|k|2ik1)[h(l)

0 () +  1

2 h(l)

1 () +  2

2 h(l)

2 () + . . .],

(2.8)

an expression which deserves further explanation. firstly, the successive terms in this series
1 since they arise in string theory from world-sheet

are spaced in integer powers of 2
congurations with increasing numbers of boundaries with dirichlet conditions and/or
handles. the functions h(l)
i () (which also depend on the instanton charge k), that appear
here, are severely constrained by the fact that hl is a modular function. secondly, we have
assumed that there is no 2 = g1 dependence in the overall factor d(k, l). any such

4 in the charge-k sector with phase e2ik1 there could be contributions from non-bps con-
gurations of k + k  instantons and k  anti-instantons. these would be suppressed by an
additional factor of e4kn/. due to their dierent n dependence such terms would not enter
our considerations, even if they were present.

6

dependence would have to be a power that arises from the zero mode integrations around

the d-instanton. this power should not depend on l. but we know from the l = 1 case
(2.3) that there is no such overall factor.5 this statement should also be a consequence
of supersymmetric cancellations of bosonic zero mode contributions with fermionic ones.

therefore, this might be special to a class of correlation functions such as the ones in the

short multiplet we are concerned with.

rewriting the amplitude in terms of n ,  and  and summing the total contribution

to the k instanton background from all powers in the derivative expansion (all l) gives

(using (2.4),(2.6) and (2.8))

hy m |k =e2 |k|n

(2.9)

this can be reorganized into a t hooft expansion by grouping together the powers of 1/n ,

which gives the perturbation expansion around the bps k-instanton conguration,

hy m |k = e2 |k|n

 +ik xm=1

n 1 m

2 fm(, ).

(2.10)

at rst sight it might seem surprising that the series of uctuations about an instanton
should have a t hooft expansion in powers of n 1/2. from the string viewpoint the
spacing by half-integer powers of 1/n arises very naturally from the presence of all integer
powers of  in (2.4). furthermore, this feature is conrmed directly in the yangmills
theory by a saddle point analysis of the contribution of the exact zero-mode measure (as

for example in (5.7) of [7]). for general instanton number k > 1 the uctuations around
the saddle point are in powers of n 1/2. the series of fractional powers of n therefore
arises from the k-instanton measure. only in the case k = 1 does the series consist of
terms with integer spaced powers of 1/n (starting with n 1/2).

the key point following from the structure of (2.9) is that the power of  in the

expansion is always bounded by that of n .

in other words, each function fm(, ) in

(2.10) is a polynomial in ,

fm(, ) =

[ m1

2

]

xk=0

kh(m2k)

k

().

(2.11)

5 actually, the essence of our conclusion will not be aected even if we had an overall factor

of gnl , with nl taking values over non-negative integers.

7

for example,

f1(, ) = h(1)

0 (),

f2(, ) = h(2)

0 (),

f3(, ) = h(3)

0 () + h(1)

1 (),

. . . .

(2.12)
by our initial arguments, this is the complete form of the answer for small  or equivalently
large . barring the (unlikely) possibility of a phase transition as a function of , the

knowledge that fm is a polynomial in positive powers of  at large  allows it to be
analytically continued to weak t hooft coupling.6 but then the polynomial form of fm
means that there are only a nite number of terms in the small- perturbation expansion

for each power of n .

thus the very structure of the string expansion implies a sequence of non-trivial

non-renormalisation theorems for t hooft perturbation theory around an instanton back-

ground.

in particular, the leading large n term comes from m = 1 and that is just a

constant as far as its dependence on  is concerned.

in other words, it receives only a

semi-classical contribution. this explains the fact that the semi-classical approximation

to the k-instanton contribution to n = 4 su (n ) yangmills theory at leading order in
n (the term of order n 1/2 which was evaluated in [7]) agrees precisely with the expres-
sion predicted by the ads/cft correspondence [5]. moreover, from (2.12) we see that
the next to leading term should behave as n 0h(2)
0 () and is also independent of  and
therefore semi-classically exact. verifying this prediction would require knowledge of the
l = 2 term in (2.4) that contributes at order ()0.

other predictions can also be tested. for instance, the structure of f3 in (2.12) requires
that the next term in the 1/n expansion has only two terms in the loop expansion. also, in

the special case of instanton number k = 1 the semi-classical contribution was computed

in [16] for all values of n . in this case the expansion is in integer powers of 1/n , which

immediately determines that

h(2k)
0

(, k = 1) = 0,

h(2k1)
0

(, k = 1) = bkg1()

6 even though the orginal expansion in  (2.4) and g (2.8) may only be asymptotic, we
can nevertheless trust (2.11) to small . this is similar to the statement that though the full

perturbative expansion in gauge theories has zero radius of convergence, the planar diagram
expansion can be trusted in some nite radius [15].

3. comments and conclusions

we have seen by making rather minimal assumptions that certain instanton contribu-

tions in the t hooft limit of n = 4 supersymmetric su (n ) yangmills theory receive only

a nite number of perturbative corrections at a given order in the 1/n expansion. more
precisely, at order n 1 m
2 ] terms in the power series in the t hooft coupling,
, starting with 0. it should be emphasised that, unlike with usual non-renormalisation

2 there are [ m+1

theorems, our statements only apply at each order in 1/n in the t hooft limit whereas for

nite n perturbative terms appear at all loops. although our arguments do not make di-

rect use of supersymmetry, this enters indirectly since the ads/cft correspondence does

require supersymmetry. this is similar in spirit to the way in which the mere existence

of a lorentz invariant eleven-dimensional limit of m-theory implies non-trivial facts about

d0-brane quantum mechanics, as in the dlcq description.

the assumptions we have made have the virtue that they can be checked by direct

evaluation of perturbative contributions in the large-n expansion of the gauge theory. in

this way one could investigate to what extent these results apply to theories with less

supersymmetry. it would, for instance, be interesting to nd out how much can be said

about the conformal eld eld theories described in [17,18]. in such cases the dual string
theory has an s5/ sector which could admit world sheet instantons whose absence was

one of the important ingredients in our argument.
