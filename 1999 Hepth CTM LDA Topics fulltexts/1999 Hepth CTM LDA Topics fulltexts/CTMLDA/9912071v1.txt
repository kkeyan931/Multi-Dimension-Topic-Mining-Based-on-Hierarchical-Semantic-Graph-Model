abstract

the electroweak phase transition in the magnetic and hypermagnetic elds is
studied in the standard model on the base of investigation of symmetry behaviour
within the consistent eective potential of the scalar and magnetic elds at nite
temperature. it includes the one-loop and daisy diagram contributions. all dis-
covered fundamental fermions and bosons are taken into consideration with their
actual masses. the higgs boson mass is chosen to be in the energy interval 75
gev  mh  115 gev. the eective potential calculated is real at suciently
high temperatures due to mutual cancellation of the imaginary terms entering
the one-loop and the daisy diagram parts. symmetry behaviour shows that nei-
ther the magnetic nor the hypermagnetic eld does not produce the suciently
strong rst order phase transition. for the eld strengths h, hy  1023 g the
electroweak phase transition is of second order at all. therefore, baryogenesis
does not survive in the standard model in smooth magnetic elds. the problems
on generation of the elds at high temperature and their stabilization are also
discussed in a consistent way. in particular, it is determined that the nonabelian
component of the magnetic eld (gh)1/2  g4/3t has to be produced sponta-
neously. to investigate the stability problem the w -boson mass operator in the
magnetic eld at high temperature is calculated in one-loop approximation. the
comparison with results obtained in other approaches is done.

1. introduction

among interesting problems of nowadays high energy physics there are two ones
which, at rst glance, are not connected with each other. these are the value of
the higgs boson mass mh and the strengths of magnetic elds h which could
be present in the early universe (see surveys [1] - [4]). both problems are of

1

paramount importance for particle physics and cosmology. for instance, as was
shown in refs. [6], [8], [9] a large scale homogeneous hypercharge magnetic eld
hy must essentially inuence the type of the electroweak (ew) phase transition
making it strong rst order. interest to the eects of strong magnetic elds has
considerably increased recently when it was realized that a standard baryogen-
esis scenario in the standard model (sm) of elementary particles could not be
established without the elds [13]. dierent mechanisms to produce the elds
have been proposed [20], [17], [11], [21], [4], [22]-[26], [3]. one of the purposes
of the present paper is to discuss some recent results on these topics. at the
same time, in the monte carlo simulations and by the nonperturbative methods
of quantum eld theory [15], [14] the magnetic mass of nonabelian gauge elds of
order mmag.  g2t has been determined. it screens the nonabelian component of
the magnetic eld at long distances. this is one of the reasons why an interest to
the hypermagnetic eld hy was excited. this eld, owing to its abelian nature,
is not screened at nite temperature. the inuence of hypermagnetic elds on
symmetry behaviour has been rst investigated for many years ago in ref. [16]
where the similarity to superconductivity was emphasized. this important ob-
servation plays a decisive role in the description of the ew phase transition. the
problem which requirs further investigations is the generation of strong abelian
elds at high temperature.
interesting mechanism connecting with an abilian
anomaly was suggested in ref. [7].

much more involving is situation with the magnetic eld, although it is studied
for many years. currently, there are not common opinions about either the
ways of producing and stabilization the eld or its role at high temperature (see
papers [19], [20], [27] and references therein). this situation, probably, nds an
explanation in the nonabelian nature of the eld and lack of simple analogies in
condensed matter physics (mainly superconductivity is discussed). as an example
of peculiarities, let us mention the phenomenon of condensation of the w - and
z-boson elds which originates from the instability of the perturbative vacuum in
strong magnetic elds (see refs. [30] - [32]). in such a situation, to treat problems
with the external elds correctly the consistent calculations have to be carried
out. recent investigations of the phase transitions in the magnetic elds at high
temperature [34], [35], [27] have used as a qualitative picture of the phenomenon
the description in refs. [36], [20] derived at a classical level for the case mh = mz
corresponding to second type superconductivity. however, in these papers the
eects of fermions (light and heavy) as well as the radiation corrections in the
elds at high temperature have not been included but play an important role.
the second goal of the present paper is to elaborate the situation with magnetic
elds at high temperatures. we shall consider all the problems mentioned within
consistent calculations allowing for the one-loop eective potential (ep) and the
daisy diagram contributions in the external elds at high temperature. to nd
the latter ones the one-loop polarization functions of gauge bosons under these
external conditions will be computed. as it is occured, the inuence of the elds

2

crucially depends on the values of the particle masses. so, to have a reliable
quantitative description of the ew phase transition we x them to be equal to
the present day experimental data. the higgs boson mass will be taken in the
energy interval 75 gev  mh  115 gev. the low bound corresponds to the
mass values when perturbative methods are reliable. the upper bound is chosen
to t the present experimental low limit mh  90 gev. in our calculations, the
external elds will taken into account exactly through the green functions. this
insures, the results to be obtained should reproduce correctly the eects of the
elds for all the values mh considered.
it is also important to notice that in
strong elds at high temperatures light fermions dominate, as it follows from
the term h 2logt /mf entering the one-loop eective potential, where mf is the
fermion mass. actually, at dierent temperatures the dierent fermions give the
dominant contributions.

the concept of symmetry restoration at high temperature has been intensively
used in studying of the evolution of the universe at its early stages. nowadays it
is a corner stone in investigations of various problems of cosmology and particle
physics [37], [38]. in particular, the type of the ew phase transition and, hence,
a further evolution of the universe depends on the mass of higgs boson. as
we mentioned above, the idea that strong elds make the ew phase transition
strong rst order, that is necessary to retain the standard baryogenesis (see recent
survey [13]), requirs further investigations with radiation corrections allowed for.
since all the masses of fundamental particles, except mh , are known one is able
to investigate in detail the phase transition as the function of this parameter and
to determine the properties of the vacuum. that is the main goal of the present
paper.

various aspects of the phase transitions in magnetic elds at high temperature
have been discussed in literature [39] - [42], [18]. in refs. [43], [44], considering
the boson part of the salam-weinberg model, the ew phase transition in the
strong elds was investigated and the vacuum structures of the phases have also
been described. in ref.
[18] side by side with temperature and magnetic eld
a chemical potential was incorporated. but the role of fermions has not been
studied in detail.

another aspect of the ew phase transition, which also has not been elabo-
rated, is the inuence of so-called daisy (or ring) diagrams at high temperature
and strong elds. at zero eld it has been investigated in refs.
[45], [55], [46]
where the importance of these diagrams to correctly describe symmetry behaviour
was emphasized. in ref.
[46] the t-quark mass was chosen of order 110 gev.
so, to account of the experimental value mt = 175 gev, it has to be revised.
in the present paper the ew phase transition will be studied for the case of the
constant elds hy and h. this is an adequate approximation for strong elds
in the cases of the second order phase transition and the initial stage of the rst
order one when the bubbles are not large [8].

the content is as follows. in sect. 2, for convenience of readers, the results of

3

the investigations announced are described in a qualitative manner. in sects. 3,
4 the contributions of bosons and fermions to the one-loop ep v (1)(t, h, c) of
classical the scalar c and the external magnetic elds are calculated in the form
convenient for numeric investigations. in sect. 5 the correlation corrections due
to daisy diagrams are computed and the vacuum stability condition at high tem-
perature is discussed. special attention is devoted to computation of the daisy
diagrams with the unstable (tachyonic) mode presenting in the magnetic eld
in the w -boson spectrum. in sect. 6 the restored phase with external elds is
described. in sect. 7 the high temperature expansion of the ep is present. then,
in sect. 8 the ew phase transition in the hypercharge magnetic eld is investi-
gated. the same for the magnetic eld case is carried out in sect. 9. in these
two sections the detailed analysis of the phase transition is done. the one-loop
polarization functions of w -bosons at high temperatures and strong magnetic
elds are calculated in sect. 10. this, in particular, gives possibility to study
self-consistently the vacuum stability. the spontaneous vacuum magnetization at
high temperature is investigated in sect. 11. it is found that the magnetic elds
of order (gh)1/2  g4/3t is generated. such strong elds aect all the processes
at high temperatures. comparison of the results obtained with that of other
approaches is done in sect. 12. discussion and concluding remarks are given in
sect. 13. appendix contains necessary information on the mellin transformation
technique used in calculations of the high temperature asymptotics of the ep.

2.qualitative picture of the ew phase tran-
sition in magnetic fields

as it is belived nowadays, the presence of dierent kind strong magnetic elds
in the early universe is rather resonable than exotic phenomenon. in literature
on this topic a lot of dynamic mechanisms to generate the elds are proposed
(see surveys [4], [3] and references therein).
in the present paper, we are not
going to consider all of them. our goal is to describe a consistent picture of the
inuence of the elds on the ew phase transition. in this section, we consider in
a qualitative manner the mechanisms of producing the external elds, the ways of
their action on the vacuum at zero and nite temperature and present the main
results of our investigation.

2.1 the generation of the primordial magnetic elds

the generation of the elds can be devided in two classes: 1) generation due to
processes that had happened at the ew phase transition; 2) creation of the elds
before the ew phase transition epoch (for instance, at a gut scale). to the
rst class we refer: the rotation of bubbles at the rst order phase transition [22];
uctuation of gradients of the higgs eld [5]; bubble collisions [24], [25]. these

4

mechanisms produce microscopic elds which had to be amplied by magnetohy-
drodynamic processes up to the macroscopic values required to t the astronomic
observations, as it is discussed in refs. [50], [51].

to the second class of the processes we refer the spontaneous vacuum magne-
tization at high temperature discovered rst at zero temperature by savvidy [52]
and the elds generated by strings [48]. ones had been created, these elds were
frozen in a cosmic plasma, evolved with it during the expansion of the universe
and present at the ew phase transition. in what follows, the former mechanism
will be investigated in detail. we shall show that it does work at high tem-
perature. so, it could serve to produce the seed magnetic eld (in contrast to
conclusions of refs. [34], [35]).

let us remind the results of refs. [52], [17], [20], [19]. the spontaneous vac-
uum magnetization has been derived from the investigation of the ep of covari-
antly constant (sourceless) chromomagnetic eld h a = ha3 which is a solution
to the classical yang-mills eld equations, where h = const and a is an isotopic
index,

v (h, t ) =

+ v (1)(h, t ).

(1)

it includes the tree-level and the one-loop parts. the minimum of the ep at high
temperature t corresponds to the nonzero magnetic eld of order (gh)(1/2) 
g2t , g is gauge coupling constant. 1 in the ew theory, the a = 3 component of
the weak isospin just corresponds to the nonabelian part of usual magnetic eld
which we observe in the broken phase.

very important for our analysis is the value of the vacuum eld strength
 g2t .
in fact, as it will be shown in sect. 11, this value is increased when
the correlation corrections are taken into acccunt. the eld is screened at long
distances l  1/mmag  1/g2t by the magnetic mass of gauge eld. however,
inside this space domain the strong elds may exist and aect all the processes.
really, typical particle masses are of order mt  gt , therefore, for small g
the compton wave length compt.  1/mt , giving the particle size, and the
larmor radius, rlarmor  1/(gh)1/2  1/g2t , determining the space range
where the charged particle spectrum is formed, are both located inside a domain
which is lled up by the eld. hence it follows that the eld strengths of order
(gh)1/2  g2t or stronger are of interest at high temperature and, in particular,
the savvidy mechanism gives rise such intense elds.
interesting mechanism to generate the hypercharge magnetic eld due to the
abelian anomaly was proposed in ref. [7]. at presen time it is not investigated
in detail. so, in what follows we will not consider a consistent picture with this
eld. we will just assume that the strong external eld hy present when the
transition had happened.

1 in paper [20] the important cancellation of logarithmic terms entering the zero and the
nite temperature parts of the ep was missed. this has been resulted in the incorrect value of
the vacuum magnetic eld spontaneously created at nite temperature.

5

below, we shall study the inuence of constant the usual magnetic [18], [10]
and the hypercharge magnetic [6], [8], [9], [12] elds. such the approximation is
not articial for strong elds. more denitely, the gradients of elds are negligible
if the relation | h/h |<< h/m holds [49]. here, m is a characteristic mass
of the problem under consideration. it means that in strong elds the dominat
eects are due to intensity of the elds. at high temperature, particle masses
are of order m  gt . as it was pointed out in ref. [8] this approximation works
well for the second order phase transitions and for the rst stages of the rst
order ones when the bubbles are not large. on the other hand, in refs. [7], [6] it
was argued that strong stochastic hypermagnetic elds are able to produce the
baryon asymmetry of the universe. these problems are left beyond the scope of
the present paper.

2.2 mechanisms of acting of the external elds on a vacuum

y /2  o(m 4

the ways in which the magnetic and the hypermagnetic elds aect the vacuum
scalar condensate are quite dierent. in the latter case, it is completely similar to
the case of superconductivity, as it was investigated rst in ref. [16]. in broken
phase, the gauge eld ( u(1) gauge eld in the higgs model and z-boson eld in
the ew theory) is screened by its mass. this is the consequence of the interaction
2 presenting in the lagrangian,  is the scalar eld. the inuence of
term  a2
the external eld is reduced to the increase of the vacuum energy and it manifests
itself at tree level. in suciently strong elds the symmetry restoration happens
and the gauge eld mass ma = gc becomes equal zero. for the critical eld
strength one has an estimate, h 2
a), which shows that the restoration
happens when the energy density of the external eld equals to that of the scalar
condensate  m 4
a. this mechanism works both at zero and nite temperature.
in the latter case, the critical value of hy is decreasing when the temperature is
increasing, as in superconductors. if the mass mh  mz, the vacuum of the sm
is the rst type superconductor with respect to hypermagnetic eld otherwise
it is the second type one. this picture is determined at a classical level [16].
the external hypermagnetic eld delays the rst order phase transition making
it stronger, that is necessary for baryogenesis. this conclusion has been obtain in
three approximation in ref. [6]. as it was discussed in detail in ref. [13], to have
a standard baryogenesis scenario the ratio r = c/tc of the order parameter
jump to the critical temperature must be of order  1.2  1.5 at zero external
elds, one has r  0.6 for mh  70  80 gev.
in the ew theory, the u(1) symmetry corresponding to electromagnetic eld
is retained in the broken phase. therefore, there are no couplings of the scalar and
the electromagnetic elds at tree level. hence, one would expect that the external
elds aect the vacuum condensate through the radiation corrections as it was
discussed in ref.
[53]. however, in the nonabelian case the inuence of elds
on the scalar condensate is more complicate and the phase transition in strong

external magnetic elds can happen at tree level, because of the non-linearity
of the eld equations. the vacuum properties are determined by not only the
scalar eld condensate c but also the other order parameter - so-called w -boson
condensate [54], [43], [36] (see also surveys [33], [32]). actually, here one faces the
situation with interacting order parameters. in the ew lagrangian the next two
terms,  fw +
c, enter, where f is an electromagnetic
eld strength tensor, w  is the w-boson eld. the former interaction is due
it is crucial
to a gyromagnetic ratio  = 2 inherent the nonabelian theories.
for exciting in strong constant magnetic elds h  h0 = m 2
w/e in the w -
boson spectrum of the tachyonic (unstable) mode p2
3 + m 2
w  eh, p3 is a
momentum along the eld direction, which then is condensed owing to the self-
 w  )2. the w -boson condensate inuences the scalar eld
interaction  (w +
at classical level (due to the second of the above written interaction terms). as
a result, the scalar condensate is eliminated and the condensates of w - and z-
boson elds are formed [33], [43], [36]. the threshold of the phase transition is
determined by the value of the higgs boson mass.
if mh < mw the vacuum
is the rst type supercondustor with respect to the magnetic eld.
in this
case the homogeneous w -condensate is formed [54]. for mh > mw the vacuum
behaves as a second type superconductor, therefore the lattice structure of the
abrikosov type formed by the w- and z-boson elds is produced. this picture
has been derived for arbitrary mass mh in refs.
[43], [58] and for the special
value mh = mz in refs. [36], [32].

these vacuum properties have been determined in tree approximation when
fermions do not contribute. but they do contribute in one-loop order, and, more-
over, play a decisive role in the vacuum dynamics. in strong elds at high tem-
peratures the inuence of light fermions is increased, as the consequence of the
term  h 2log(t /mf ) entering the one-loop ep. besides, other peculiarities must
be taken into consideration. namely, the ep contains additional t -dependent
terms, such as  2
ct 2, eht c, etc. (see more details in sects. 5, 7), which
are generated in the one-loop and higher orders of perturbation theory. these
terms make the picture of the eld action involving. therefore, to investigate
symmetry behaviour numeric calculations must be carried out.

2.3 symmetry behaviour in magnetic elds

as it is well known [45], [46], [55], at nite temperature side by side with the one-
loop ep the correlation corrections described by the daisy diagrams should be
added in the consistent calculations. series of these diagrams are responsible for
the long range eects and contain imaginary terms which cancel the imaginary
part of the one-loop ep. as a result, the total ep is real at suciently high
temperature. this important property is fullled also in the external elds when
the contribution of daisy diagrams with unstable mode is allowed for [10], [11].

now, we are going to describe symmetry behaviour at high temperature and

strong magnetic elds. in what follows we assume that only one type of the elds
is applied. remind that in the broken phase the component of hy responsible for
the magnetic eld is unscreened and the form of the ep curve corresponds to both
the magnetic and the hypemagnetic elds. in order to investigate the ew phase
transition we shall consider the function v  = v(h, b, )  v(h, b, 0) describing
the symmetry restoration. here, the dimensionless magnetic, h = h/h0, h0 =
m 2
w/e, and the scalar,  = c/(0), elds and the inverse temperature, b = mw,
are introduced, (0) is the ep minimum position at zero temperatures and elds
(more details see in sects. 8, 9). the normalized order parameter  is changed
from unit to zero that is convenient in numeric calculations.

in fact, symmetry breaking (restoration) can be realized in two ways. by the
rst order phase transition with a nonzero jump of the order parameter c 6= 0
or by the second order one when the order parameter is changing smoothly.
in fig. 1 we depict symmetry behaviour at high temperatures for the rst
order phase transition. notice that we consider the metastable electroweak min-
imum which is separated from a global unbounded state disposed at large values
of 2 by a wide and high potential barrier. the temperatures tc1 and tc2 are
called the spinodal temperatures, which correspond the situations when bubles
of the broken (tc1) and the restored (tc2) phases can not exist in the vacuum.

in fig. 2 we show symmetry behaviour for the second order phase transition.
in this case baryogenesis can not be realized because of washing away the baryon-
antibaryon asymmetry (see survey [13]).

as we mentioned before, at zero external elds the value of the parameter
r  0.6 and so baryogenesis is not possible in the sm. our main task here is to

parameter c(h, t ) is increasing monotonically with temperature decreasing.

investigate the situation with strong external elds been taken into consideration.
the general picture of the phase transitions is independent of the specic
external conditions considered. the external elds change the parameters (or the
type) of the phase transitions. besides, because of the dierent mechanisms of
inuence of the magnetic and hypermagnetic elds on the vacuum the conditions
xing the transition temperature are also dierent for these elds (for more details
see sects. 8, 9).

now, let us describe the restored phase. for the magnetic eld case, because
of the presence of the tachyonic mode in the w-boson spectrum, the state  = 0
is unstable at zero temperature. to better understand the situation at t 6= 0, let
us rst discussed the one-loop case. to verify whether the vacuum is stable or
not one has to consider the eective mass squared of the unstable mode dened
as the sum of the ground state energy squared taken at zero momentum and
the one-loop w-boson mass operator averaged over the ground state. it must be
considered for the value of h condensed at high temperature. in particular, we
have for the eld h (1) condensed at the one-loop level (gh)1/2
c = (g2/2)t [10]:
m 2(hc, t ) = (hc, t, n = 0,  = +1) ghc > 0. thus, the vacuum stabilization
is observed. the situation which takes place when the correlation corrections are
included is discussed in sect. 11.

in the restored phase the w -bosons do not interact with the hypermagnetic

eld. so, no instabilities occur in this case.

by investigating symmetry behaviour in either the hypermagnetic or the mag-
netic eld within the total ep inlcuding the contributions of all the sm particles
we have determined by numeric computations that for all mh values considered

9

the increase in the eld strength is resulted in the weaker (not stronger) rst
order phase transition. for h, hy  0.1  0.5 1024 g it becomes of the second
order at all. thus, we come to the conclusion that baryogenesis does not survive
at these external conditions.

to better understand the role of fermions in symmetry behaviour let us adduce
two terms of the asymptotic expansion of the one-loop ep in the limit of t 
, h  . the rst one is the term  h 2log t
. due to this term the light
fermions are dominant at high temperature. the second term can be derived
from the expansion of the zero temperature part:  ehm2
f this term acts to
make heavier the higgs particles in the eld. as a result, the second order
temperature phase transition is stimulated due to strong elds.

mf

we would like to complete this section with the comparison of the described
results with that of other approaches (for more details see sect. 8, 12). the ew
phase transition in the hypermagnetic eld has been investigated in one-loop ap-
proximation to the ep in ref.
[8] and by the method combining perturbative
results and lattice simulations in ref.
[9]. these authors bacause of dierent
reasons have skipped the fermion part of the ep and therefore had no possibil-
ity to determine the form of the ep curve in strong elds at high temperature.
in this respect our investigation lled up the gap existed. in our investigation
the external elds have been taken into account exactly through greens func-
tions. therefore, in particular, inuence of fermions on symmetry behaviour was
correctly reproduced.

ting the potential in two parts: a = a + ar

the above expressions (17), (23), (29), (30) will be used in numerical studying
of symmetry behaviour at dierent h, t . notice the cancellation of a number of
terms entering the zero-temperature part given eqs. (17) and t -depended one.
this fact has a general character and was used in checking of the correctness of
calculations.

4. fermion contributions to v (1)(h, t, c)

the fermion one-loop ep in magnetic elds is well studied [28], [29], [63]. to nd
this explicit form at nite temperature let us consider the standard unrenormal-
ized expression written in the s-representation

mf is the fermion mass. here, we have incorporated the equation (9) to include a
temperature dependence. in what follows, we shall allow for the contributions of
all fermions - leptons and quarks - with their present masses. usually, considering
symmetry behaviour without eld one restricts himself by a t-quark contribution,
only. but in the case of external elds applied this is not a good idea, since the
dependence of v (1) on h is a complicate function of the ratio m2
f /eh. so, at
some xed values of h, t the dierent kind dependencies on h will contribute for
fermions with dierent masses. hence, a very complicate dependence on the eld
takes place in general. we shall include this in a total by carrying out numerical
computetions and summing up over all the fermions. now, separating a zero

(34)

again, a number of terms in eqs. (32) and (34) are cancelled in the total, as in
the bosonic sector.

these two expressions will also be used in numeric investigations of symmetry

behaviour.

5. contribution of daisy diagrams

it was shown by carrington [46] that at t 6= 0 the consistent calculation of the
ep based on the generalized propagators, which include the polarization operator
insertions, requires that daisy (ring) diagrams have to be added simultaneously
with the one-loop contributions. these diagrams essentially aect the phase
transition at high temperature and zero eld [45], [46], [55]. their importance at
t and h 6= 0 was also pointed out in refs. [10], [11].
as it is known [15], [45], the sum of daisy diagrams describes a dominant
contribution of long distances. it is important when massless states appear in
a system. so, this type of diagrams has to be allowed for when a symmetry
restoration is investigated. to nd the correction vring(h, t ) at high temperature
and magnetic eld the polarization operators of the higgs particle, photon and
z-boson at the considered background should be calculated. then, vring(h, t )
is given by a series depicted in gures 3, 4.
here, a dashed line describes
the higgs particles, the wavy lines represent photons and z-bosons, the blobs
correspond to the polarization operators in the limit of zero momenta. as also it
is known [45], [46], in order to calculate the contribution of daisy diagrams the
limiting expressions of the polarization operators (k, t, h) at zero momenta,
00(k = 0, t, h), are to be substituted. this limit, called the debye mass, can be

lated at zero momenta.

computed from the ep of the special type. the latter fact considerably simplies
our task.

now, let us turn to calculations of vring(h, t ). it is given by the standard

expression [15], [45], [46], [17]:

vring = 

1

12

t r{[m 2() + 00(0)]3/2  m 3()},

(35)

where trace means the summation over all the contributing states, m() is
the tree mass of the corresponding state. the functions 00(0) are: 00(0)
=(k = 0, t, h) for the higgs particle; 00(0) = 00(k = 0, t, h) - the zero-
zero components of the polarization functions of gauge elds in the magnetic
eld taken at zero momenta. the above contributions are of order  g3(3/2)
in the coupling constants whereas the two-loop terms have order  g4(2). for
00(0) the high temperature limits of polarization functions have to be substi-
tuted which are of order  t 2 for leading terms and  gct, (gh)1/2t (c/t <<
1, (gh)1/2/t << 1) for subleading ones.

5.1 the polarization function of scalar eld

for the next step of calculation, we remind that the eective potential is the
generating functional of the one-particle irreducible green functions at zero ex-
ternal momenta. so, to have (0) we can just calculate the second derivative
with respect to  of the potential v (1)(h, t, ) in the limit of high temperature,
t >> , t >> (eh)1/2, and then set  = 0. this limit can be calculated by
means of the mellin transformation technique (see, for instance, [19]) and the
result looks as follows:

iq determines the fermion contribution of
the parameter cf =
order  t 2 having relevance to our problem. we also have omitted  t 4 contri-
butions to the ep. the terms of the type  log[t /f (, h)] cancel the logarithmic
terms in the temperature independent parts (16), (31). considering the high tem-
perature limit we restrict ourselves to linear and quadratic in t terms, only.

one else important expression, which also should be taken into account, is

the linear in h term of the zero temperature ep which looks as follows:

v (1)
f,l (h, c)/h 2

0 = 


2

2xf

kf | qf h | .

(37)

it signicantly aects symmetry behaviour and contributes to the debye mass in
strong elds.

now, dierentiating these expressions twice with respect to  and setting

(38)

the terms  t 2 give standard contributions to temperature mass squared com-
ing from the boson and fermion sectors. the h-dependent term is negative since
the dierence in the brackets is 32( 1
2, 1
2)  1  0, 39. formally, this may
result in the negativeness of (0) for very strong elds (eh)1/2 > t . but this
happens in the range of parameters where asymptotic axpansion is not applica-
ble. substituting expression (38) into eq. (35) we obtain (in the dimensionless
variables)

(39)

as one can see, the last term of this expression cancels the fourth term in eq.
(36), which becomes imaginary at 32 < 1. this is the important cancellation
preventing the infrared instability at high temperature.

notice that eq. (36) contains other term (the last one) which becomes imag-
inary for strong magnetic elds or small 2. it reects the known instability in
the w -boson spectrum [30], [31].

18

5.2 the debye masses of photons and z-bosons

to nd the h-dependent debye masses of photons and z-bosons the following
procedure will be used. we calculate the one-loop contributions to the ep due to
the w -bosons and the fermions in a magnetic eld and some chemical potential,
, which plays the role of an auxiliary parameter. then, by dierentiating them
twice with respect to  and setting  = 0 the mass squared m2
d will be obtained.
let us outline that in more detail for the case of fermion contributions where the
result is well known.

the temperature dependent part of the one-loop ep of constant magnetic
eld at a non-zero chemical potential induced by an electron-positron vacuum
polarization is [63]:

where m is the electron mass, e = gsinw is the electric charge and s-representation
is used. its second derivative with respect to  taken at  = 0 can be written in
the form

(41)

expanding coth(ehs) in series and integrating over s in accordance with formula
(22) we obtain in the limit of t >> m, t >> (eh)1/2:

(1)l+1[

8m

(42)

series in l can easily be calculated by means of the mellin transformation (see
refs.
[64], [19], [18]). to have the debye mass squared it is necessary to dif-
ferentiate eq. (41) with respect to 2 and take into account the relation of the
parameter  with the zero component of the electromagnetic potential :   iea0
[17]. in this way we obtain nally,

m2

d = g2sin2w(

t 2
3 

1
22 m2 + o((m)2, (eh2))).

(43)

this coinsides with the known result calculated from the photon polarization
operator [62]. as one can see, the dependence on h appears in the order  t 2.
to nd the total fermion contribution to m2
d one has to sum up the expression
(43) over all fermions and substitute their electric charges.

to calculate m2

d for z-bosons it is sucient to account of the fermion coupling
to z-eld. it can be done by substituting   i(g/2cosw + gsin2w). the result

interaction which is not reproduced by the above substitution:

(44)

now, let us apply the above procedure to obtain the w -boson contribution.
the corresponding ep (temperature dependent part) calculated at non-zero t, 
looks as follows,

(45)
all the notations are obvious. the rst term in the squared brackets gives the
triple contribution of the charged scalar eld and the second one is due to the
interaction with a w -boson magnetic moment. again, after dierentiation twice
with respect to  and setting  = 0 it can be written as

and carrying out all the calculations described above, we obtain for the w - boson

(48)

hence it follows that spin does not aect the debye mass in leading order. other
interesting feature is that the next-to-leading terms are negative.

the contribution of the w -boson sector to the z-boson mass m2

d is given
by expression (48) with the replacement g2sin2w  g2cos2w. summing up the
expressions (43) and (48) and substituting them in eq. (35), we obtain the photon
part v 
ring, where it is necessary to express masses in terms of the vacuum value
of the scalar condensate c. in the same way the daisy diagrams of z-bosons

20

v z
ring can be calculated. the only dierence is the mass term of z-eld and the
additional term in the debye mass due to the neutral current  z. these
three elds - , , z,- which become massless in the restored phase, contribute
into vring(h, t ) in the presence of the magnetic eld. at zero eld, there are also
terms due to the w -boson loops in figs. 3, 4. but when h 6= 0 the charged
particles acquire masses  eh and these daisies can be neglected.

5. 3 daisy diagrams of the tachyonic mode

0 = p2

3 + m 2

a separate consideration should be spared to the tachyonic (unstable) mode in
the w -boson spectrum: p2
weh. first of all, we notice that this mode
is excited due to a spin interaction and it does not inuence the g00(k) component
of the w -boson propagator. secondly, in the elds eh  m 2
w the mode becomes
the long range state. therefore, it should be included in vring(h, t ) side by
side with other considered neutral elds. but in this case it is impossible to
take advantage of formula (35) and we return to the initial ep containing the
generalized propagators.

for our purpose it will be convenient to make use of the generalized ep written

as the sum over the modes in the external magnetic eld [17], [18]:

where l = 2l
w + (2n + 1  2)eh and (h, t ) is the radiation
mass squared of w -bosons in magnetic eld at nite temperature. denoting as
d1

l + 2, one can rewrite eq. (49) as follows:

(50)

here, the rst term is just the one-loop contribution of w -bosons, the second one
gives the sum of daisy diagrams of the unstable mode (as it can easily be checked
by expanding the logarithm in a series). the last term describes the sum of the
short range modes in the magnetic eld and should be omitted.

thus, to nd v unstable

ring

one has to calculate the second term in eq. (50). in

the high temperature limit we obtain:

v unstable
ring

=

eh
2{(m 2

w  eh + (h, t ))1/2  (m 2

w  eh)1/2}.

(51)

21

by summing up the one-loop ep and all the terms vring, we arrive at the total
consistent in leading order ep.

let us mention the most important features of the above expression. it is seen
that the last term in eq. (51) exactly cancels the dangerous term in eq. (36).
so, the ep is real and no instabilities appear at sucently high temperatures
when (h, t ) > m 2
w  eh. to make a quantitative estimate of the range of
validity of the total ep it is necessary to calculate the w -boson mass operator
in a magnetic eld at nite temperature and hence to nd (h, t ). this is a
separate and enough cogent problem which is considered in detail in ref.
[66].
here, we only adduce the result of (h, t ) calculations:

unstable(h, t ) = < n = 0,  = 1 | charged



| n = 0,  = 1 >

= [12, 33(eh)1/2t + i4(eh)1/2t ],

(52)

where the average value of the mass operator in the ground state of the w -
boson spectrum | n = 0,  = +1 > was calculated. this expression has been
obtained in the limit eh/t 2 << 1, b = mw/t << 1. side by side with the
real part responsible for the radiation mass squared the expression (52) contains
the imaginary one describing the decay of the state. the latter term is small as
the former one is compared and of order of the usual damping constants at high
temperature. so, im(h, t ) can be ignored in our problem. the radiation mass
squared is positive. it acts to stabilize the spectrum. at h = 0 no screening is
produced in one-loop order, as it should be at nite temperatures for transversal
modes [15]. thus, we come to conclusion that at suciently high temperature
the eective w -boson mass squared m 2
w  eh + (h, t ) is positive and
no conditions for w -boson condensation discussed in refs. [43], [32] are realized.

6. restored phase in the external magnetic
fields

having calculated the ep at  6= 0 we are able to determine the kind of the ew
phase transition for dierent mh , h. that will be done in the next sections. here,
we are going to describe in more detail the restored phase with the hypermagnetic
and magnetic elds. let us consider rst the former case.

to describe more precise the restored phase one has to calculate radiation
corrections to the external eld hy at high temperature. before doing that let
2 express (52) disagrees with the corresponding one of ref. [34] where the average value of
the gluon polarization operator in an abelian chromomagnetic eld was calculated in weak eld
approximation and (h, t ) has been found to be zero. most probably, the discrepancy is the
concequence of the calculation procedure adopted by these authors when the gluon polarization
operator was calculated at zero external eld and then its average value has been calculated in
the state | n = 0,  = +1 > . our expression is the high temperature limit of the mass operator
which takes into account the external eld exactly.

22

us remind that at  = 0 this eld is completely unscreened whereas the non-
abelian constituents of the electromagnetic and z-elds are screened at scales
l  (g2t )1 by the magnetic mass. remind also that we are investigating the
separate inuence of the external elds. this means that in the covariant deriva-
tive describing interaction with the external eld hy in the restored phase one
should maintain the u(1)y term only: d =  + 1
 . we set the potential
as before, bext

 = (0, 0, hy x1, 0).

in the restored phase w -bosons do not interact with hy . the eld dependent
part of the ep v ( = 0, hy , t ) is non-zero due to the contributions of fermions
and scalars. however, the fermion part depends logarithmically on temperature
( (g/2)2
y logt /t0) and can be neglected as compared to the tree level term

the term logarithmically dependent on t can again be neglected but the linear

now, let us turn to the magnetic eld case. in accordance with our approach
we set hy = 0. it will be important for what follows to remember recent results on
obeservation of the gluon magnetic mass in lattice simulations that was found to
be of order mmag  g2t (as it has been expected from nonperturbative calculatios
in quantum eld theory [15], [14]). the mass screens the nonabelian component

23

of the magnetic eld at distancies l > lm  (g2t )1 but inside the space domain
l < lm it may exist and aect all the processes at high temperatures, as it was
discussed in sect. 2.1. this fact has not been taken into consideration in a number
of investigations of the ew phase transition. in particular, in ref. [34] (as in ref.
[20]) the eld strength generated at nite temperature was erroneously estimated
as coinsiding with that at zero temperature.

the magnetic eld in the restored phase may be homogeneous or not depen-
dently on the stability of the charged boson spectrum in the eld calculated with
radiation corrections included. that can be checked in accordance with formulae
(51) and (52) at mw = 0. if the eective mass squared m 2
ef f.(h, t ) is positive, the
perturbative vacuum is stable and the external eld is homogeneous otherwise it
is unstable and a lattice structure has to be generated due to the evolution of the
instability. we shall see below, for the rst order phase transition (which is the
main topic in the present paper) m 2
ef f.(h, t, c) is positive in the minimum of the
ep when the symmetry restoration happens. therefore, we will not investigate
in detail the structure of the restored phase for dierent h restricting ourselves
by the case of the constant eld, as in the broken phase.

to make a link between studies of symmetry behaviour in the external hy-
permagnetic eld and the previous results for the usual magnetic eld [44], [17]
we notice that in the broken phase hy and h are connected by the relation
h = hy cos . so, all investigations, dealing with symmetry behaviour in a mag-
netic eld at high temperature, are relevant in the case of hy in the respect of
the form of the ep curve at dierent t, hy . the hypercharge eld inuences the
scalar eld condensate at tree level and acts to restore symmetry. that was the
reason why it has been taken into account in the lower order in refs.
[6], [8].
but, as it will be shown below, for strong elds and heavy mh the form of the
ep curve in the broken phase is very sensitive to the change of the parameters.
moreover, it is strongly depended on the correlation correction contributions. so,
to have an adequate picture of the ew phase transition symmetry behaviour with
the daisy diagrams included has to be investigated.

7. high temperature expansion of the ef-
fective potential

the most of investigations dealing with symmetry behaviour at high temperature
used the limiting form of the ep at t  . it will be of interest to compare the
results obtained in two cases - for the complete ep and for the asymptotic one.
first, let us adduce the high temperature limit of the sum of terms describ-
ing the contributions of the scalar eld at zero and nite temperature, the h-
independent contribution of w -bosons, z-bosons as well as the contributions of

24

the term 4 in eq. (58) is introduced in order to correct the infrared innity
in the eld. it eectively accounts of the fermion temperature mass. just due to
this infrared singularity the light fermions dominate in strong elds.

now, let us wright down the high temperature limits of the w -boson sector

here, the term due to the unstable mode is omitted since it is cancelled by the
second term of daisy diagrams generating by the unstable mode. as it is seen, a
lot of terms from expresion vz, at zero temperature are cancelled in the total.
the term with log(b) is -independent and therefore inessential when symmetry
behaviour is investigated,  marks the normalization point.

now, for completeness, let us write down explicitely the contributions of the

remind, for the case of the asymptotic ep the last term of eq. (63) has already
been included in eq. (56).

8. symmetry behaviour in strong hyper-
magnetic field

let us investigate the ew phase transition in the hypermagnetic eld for dierent
values of mh . it can be done by considering the gibbs free energy in the broken,
gbroken(h ext, c, t ), and the restored, grestored(h ext

y , t ), phases [6], [8]:

gbroken = v (, h, t )  ~h ~h ext
grestored = v (0, hy , t )  ~hy ~h ext
y .

y cos,

(65)

by minimization of these equations the elds h and hy generated in the vacuum
have to be expressed throught h ext
y . the rst order phase transition can be
determined within two equations:

grestored(h ext

y , t, 0) = gbroken(h ext, t, (h ext)c),

(66)

26

describing the advantage of the broken phase creation, where (h)c is a scalar
eld vacuum expectation value at given h, t, which has to be found as the
minimum position of the total ep,

v (h, t, c)total

c

= 0.

(67)

hence the critical eld strength can be calculated. in this expression and below
we use for brevity h instead h ext.

having obtained the ep in the restored phase, the one-loop ep described by
formulae (17), (23), (29)-(34) and the daisy diagram contributions vring we are
going to investigate symmetry behaviour. we shall present the results in two
stages. first, we shall consider the total ep as the function of 2 at various xed
h, t , k and determine the form of the ep curves in the broken phase. in this
way it will be possible to select the range of the parameters when the rst order
phase transition is realized. after that the temperature tc at given eld strength
hy will be found.

as usually [33], to investigate symmetry behaviour we consider the dierence
v  = re[v(h, , k, b)  v(h,  = 0, b)] which gives information about the sym-
metry restoration. we will present the results for two cases: 1) for the total ep
in the broken phase; 2) for the high temperature limits of it. then we will make
a comparison.

in what follows, it will be also convenient to express the conditions of the phase
transition in terms of the dimensionless variables h, b, , taking into account the
relation hy = h/cos. then, the gibbs free energy

gbroken(hext, , b) =

h2

+ v

(h, , b)  hhext,

has to be expressed in terms of hext through the equation

hext = h +

v (h, , b)

(68)

(69)

where v  describes the one-loop and daisy diagram contributions to the ep. the
phase transiton happens when the condition

(70)

holds. the function v

restored is given by eq. (55). we also have substituted the

the results on the phase transition determined by numeric investigation of

the total ep are summarized in table 1.

in the rst column we show the hypermagnetic eld strength in the broken
phase (in dimensionless units). in the second and third ones the mass param-
eter k = m2
w and the critical temperature of the rst order phase transi-
tion are adduced. next two columns give the local minimum position c(h, tc)
and its squared value at the transition temperature. the last two columns x
the ratio r = 246gev c(h, tc)/tc, determining the advantage of baryogenesis,
and the w -boson eective mass calculated in the local minimum of the ep at
the corresponding eld strength and the transition temperature. the parame-
ter mw(h, tc) = [( g
2 c(h, tc))2  eh + (h, tc, c)]1/2/mw is the dimensionless
w-boson mass with the radiation corrections included.
as it is seen, the increase in h makes the phase transition weaker (not stronger
as it was expected in refs. [6] , [8] by analogy to superconductivity in the external
magnetic eld). the ratio r is less then unit for all the eld strengths, wherease
the baryogenesis condition is r > 1.2 1.5 [13]. thus, we come to the conclusion
that external hypermagnetic eld does not make the ew phase transition strong
enough to produce baryogenesis. moreover, for strong elds the phase transition
is of second order for all the values of k considered.

let us continue the analysis of data in the table 1. for the eld strengths
h > 0.10.5h0(h0 = m 2
w/e) the phase transition is of second or weak rst-order.
the w-boson eective mass squared (in dimensionless units) m 2
w(c, h, bc) =
2
c(h, bc) h + (h, bc) is positive for h = 0.01 and h = 0.1. therefore, the local
minimum is the stable state at the rst order phase transition. for stronger elds,
when the second order phase transition happens, the eective w -boson mass
becomes imaginary. this reects the known instability in the external magnetic
eld which exhibits itself even when the radiation mass of the tachyonic mode is
included. but it does not matter for the problem of searching for the strong rst
order phase transition in the external eld investigated in the present paper. the
instability has to result in the condensation of w - and z-boson elds at high
temperature. however, this does not change the type of the phase transition.

28

in refs. [6], [9], [8], [67] it has been concluded that the strong hypermagnetic
eld increases the strength of the rst order phase transition and in this case
baryogenesis survives in the sm. our results are in obvious contradiction with
this conslusion. to explane the origin of the discrepancies let us rst consider
refs.
[6], [8] where a perturbative method of computations has been applied.
these authors, in studying of the ew phase transition, have allowed for the
inuence of the external eld at tree level, only. that corresponds to the usual
case of superconductors in the external magnetic eld, and, as a consequence, they
observed the strong rst order phase transition. in fact, the type of the phase
transition was just assumed, since no investigations of the ep curve with all the
particles included for dierent hy , t have been carried out. in the former paper
there was the qualitative estimate of the eld eect, whereas in the latter one the
quantitative analysis in one-loop approximation for the temperature dependent
part of the ep has been done. actually, in both these investigations the inuence
of the external eld was reduced to the consideration of the condition (70) xing
the transition temperature in the hypermagnetic eld. the role of fermions and
w -bosons in the eld was not investigated at all. however, as we have seen, the
fermions (heavy and light) are of paramount importance in the phase transition
dynamics. just due to them the ew phase transition becomes of second order
in strong elds (for the values of k when it is of rst order in weak elds).

in refs.

[9], [67] the phase transition was investigated by the method com-
bining the perturbation theory and the lattice simulations. as the rst step in
this approach the static modes only are maintained in the high temperature la-
grangian. the fermions are nonstatic modes and decoupled. the only fermion
remainder is the t-quark mass entering the eective universal theory [13], [9],
[67]. so, no fermion features in the external elds and hence no information
about the form of the ep curve could be derived in this way. in our analysis, it
has been observed that not only heavy but also light fermions are important in
strong external elds, as one, in particular, can see from the term h 2logt /mf
of the one-loop ep. at high temperature it inuences symmetry behaviour con-
siderably. actually, for various eld strengths the fermoins with dierent masses
are dominant and we have allowed for all of them. besides, we have taken into
consideration all the daisy correlation corrections in the external eld that also
aects symmetry behaviour.

we would like to stress that our perturbative results for the values of k 
0.8  0.9 are reliable. they are in agreement with nonperturbative analysis at
zero eld. the external eld is taken into consideration exactly. for these mass
mh  7580 gev we observed the change of the rst order phase transition into
the second order one with increase in the eld strength. the same behaviour takes
also place for k > 1 when the perturbative analysis may be not trusty. but, as
we have determined, the picture of the symmetry behaviour is only quantitatively
changed for heavy scalar particles: the rst order phase transition in weak elds
becomes the second order one for strong elds. these circumstances convince us

29

that the assumption of ref. [6] that the hypermagnetic eld makes the weak rst-
order phase transition strong enough is not proved by the detailed calculations.
in table 2 we adduce the results for the phase transition obtained within the

asymptotic ep.

these data, as previous ones, show that the ratio r is less then unit and the

baryogenesis condition does not hold.

now, let us compare the results in tables one and two. as one can see, even
for h = 0.01 they dier considerably for all the parameters exept the critical
temperatures. the rst order phase transition for k = 0.85 determined by both
of the potentials possesses the same characteristics. but this is not the case for
k = 1.25, 2 when the phase transition described by the exact ep is weaker rst
order. for the eld strength h = 0.1 the exact ep predicts the weak rst-order
phase transition for all k whereas the asymptotic one xes the second order
phase transition for k = 0.85. for k = 1.25, 2 the jump of the order parameter
determined by the asymptotic ep is twice larger then for the exact ep case. if
the elds are stronger then 0.2 - 05 1024 g both ep predict the second order
phase transition. thus, we conclude that asymptotic ep predicts conversion of
the rst order phase transition to the second order one for weaker elds whereas
the rst order phase trasnsition described by it is stronger as copmare to the
transition derived within the exact ep.

9. symmetry behaviour in strong magnetic
field

as we have described qualitatively in sect. 2, the case of external magnetic
eld somehow diers from the hypermagnetic one. nevertheless, a nubmer of
previous results dealing mainly with the form of the ep curve in the broken
phase are relevant, since in this phase the unscreened constituent of the external

30

hypermagnetic eld coinsides with the magnetic eld. the condition xing the
transition temperature is

vrestored(h, tc, 0) = vbroken(h, tc, c(h, tc)).

(71)

the transition happens when the depth of the minima located at the begining,
c = 0, and at c 6= 0 is the same.
below, as before, we present the results of numeric investigations of the phase
transition obtained for the exact ep and for the high temperature limit of it. in
table 3 we show the characteristics of the rst order phase transition determined
within the exact ep.

first of all notice, the baryogenesis condition r  1.2 is not satised for
neither the exact ep nor the asymptotic one. the r values are small for for all
k considered. since the external eld is accounted of exactly through the green
functions the eects of the eld inuence are also exactly reproduced. thus,
our analysis has shown that in the case of external magnetic eld baryogenesis
can not be generated in the sm. the comparison of the results for the exact
ep (table 3) and the asymptotic ep (table 4) shows that in the latter case the
second order phase transition is predicted for more weak external elds.

the main results of this and previous section can be summarized as follows:
the external either the magnetic or the hypermagnetic eld can not produce the
strong rst order ew phase transition. baryogenesis does not survive in the sm
due to these external conditions.

in the next two sections we shall investigate the problems dealing with the
spontaneous magnetization of the vacuum at high temperature and stabilization
of this state due to radiation corrections. we shall show that strong magnetic
elds h  g4/3t 2 have to be spontaneously created.

10. radiation spectra of w -boson in strong
magnetic field at high temperature

w -boson mass operator in a constant magnetic eld h at zero temperature has
been calculated and investigated in refs. [69], [70]. in particular, it gave possibil-
ity to clarify the role of the radiation corrections in the problem of stabilization of
the w -boson spectrum (see survey [70]). the temperature dependent radiation
corrections to the w -boson spectrum has been studied in ref. [66]. the longi-
tudinal components of gauge elds acquire the temperature masses  gt [15].
the tachyonic mode is the transversal state excited by a spin interaction.
its
tepmperature mass can be calculated as the average value of the mass operator
in the ground state of the spectrum.

to incorporate temperature the imaginary time formalism will be used. as
in the case of zero temperature [69], the schwinger operator method and s-
representation will be applied. in general, after summation over discrete imagi-

32

nary frequencies this method becomes not applicable. however, it remains prac-
tically unchanged in the limit of high temperature when only the static modes
l = 0 contribute [15]. this approximation is sucient to investigate the role of
the daisy diagrams and will be used in what follows.

we calculate the average value of the w -boson mass operator in the states
of w -boson spectrum in a magnetic eld | n,  >, where n,  are the landau
level number and the spin projection variable, respectively. these functions, <
m(h, t, n, ) >, give the radiation temperature dependent masses of the states.
the eective mass squared is m 2(h, t ) = m 2  eh + re < m(h, t, n = 0,  =
1) >. if this value is positive, the spectrum is stabilized by radiation corrections.
in the present section we consider a simplied model of electroweak interac-
tions (the boson part of it) based on the spontaneous breaking of su(2)  u(1)

electromagnetic potential. we also identify the gauge coupling constant g with
electric charge: g = e. in fact, this model is the mass regularization of the yang-
mills theory. in the limit m  0 all the corresponding results are reproduced.
the results for salam-weinberg theory can also be obtained by the simple sub-
stitutions, -contributions  z-contributions with the corresponding vertex and
propagator factors (see for details ref. [70]).
to investigate the problem we are interested in, let us, as before, direct the
external magnetic eld along the third axis h = h3. the corresponding potential
is chosen in the form aext
 = (0, 0, hx1, 0), h = const. to quantize the elds the
following gauge xing condition is used:

particles and the second one gives that of virtual gauge elds (photons, w- and

we restrict ourselves by investigation of the high temperature limit, that cor-
responds to the static mode l = 0. in this case the standard calculation procedure
developed at zero temperature can be straightforwardly applied. details of these
calculations can be found in refs. [69], [70], [66]. here, we note the points specic
for k4 = 0 case. for brevity, in what follows we will consider the part m (k, p ).
to integrate over d3k in eq. (74) one has to introduce the s-representation

for each propagator entering and present the product of propagators as follows

(76)

and m is the mass of the neutral scalar eld. the k4-dependent part of the hamil-
tonian is zero. then, the integration is carried out by means of the procedure
developed in ref.
[61]. the dierence between the nite and zero temperature
cases consists in the dimension of the corresponding integrals. this is reected in
the power of s appeared after integration. three dimensional integral (at t 6= 0
) gives the factor s3/2 whereas at t = 0 one obtains s2 [61].
to nd the energy of the states owing to the radiation corrections one has to
dene the w -boson mass-shell in the eld at high temperature. in the static case
it is described by the equations

this value is positive for suciently high temperatures. hence, one can conclude
that radiation corrections in the eld stabilize the vacuum at high temperatures.
the temperature mass of the transversal modes dependens on the eld and equals
to zero when h = 0, as it should be [15].

obtained results are of interest for cosmology. namely, if at the ew phase
transition epoch the magnetic eld was present, the radiation mass of w -bosons
could serve as the dynamic mechanism of the vacuum stabilization in both the
broken and the restored phases. it was discussed in detail in the previous sections.
to derive a consisten picture one has to consider a vacuum magnetization at high
temperature with the correlation corrections taken into consideration.

11. the spontaneous vacuum magnetiza-

tion at high temperature

the generation of magnetic elds in nonabelian gauge theories at nite temper-
ature is of great importance for particle physiscs and cosmology.
its positive
solution, in particular, will give a theoretical basis for investigations of the qcd
vacuum at high temperature and the primordial magnetic elds in the early uni-
verse [20], [36].
in literature dierent mechanisms of producing the elds are
discussed (see recent papers [6], [13] and references theirin). in this section we
investigate in more detail one of possibilities - the spontaneous magnetization
of the vacuum of nonabelian gauge elds at nite temperature. this problem
has been studied in one-loop order in refs. [20], [17], [19] where the creation of
the vacuum eld was derived. in ref.
[17] a number of correlation corrections
has been taken into account, but the polarization functions of gauge elds were
not calculated and therefore a trusty conclusion about the phenomenon was not
obtained. in ref. [11] that has been considered with all necessary daisy diagrams
included. below, we shall follow this paper.

c

for simplicity, we investigate the vacuum magnetization at nite temperature
within su(2) gluodynamics. considering the abelian covariatly constant chro-
momagnetic eld h a = a3h = const and nite temperature as a background,
we calculate the ep containing the one-loop and daisy diagram contributions of
the neutral and charged gluon elds. the eld dependent debye mass of neutral
gluons can be computed from a special type ep. to nd the one of the charged
gluons the high temperature limits of the gluon polarization functions at the
background are also calculated. it will be shown that in the adopted approxima-
tion the savvidy level with the eld strenght (gh)1/2
c  g4/3t is generated. this
is strong eld. although it is screened at distances l > (g2t )1 by the gluon
magnetic mass, the spectrum of charged particles, being formed at larmors ra-
dius r  (gh)1/2
 (g4/3t )1, is located inside this domain, r << lm, for small
g.
most of results for the yang-mills (ym) theory can be obtained without actual
calculations by making use of the results of the previous chapters. really, the
model considered in sect. 9 is a mass regularization of the ym theory. the
external magnetic eld just coinsides with the abelian chromomagnetic eld of
interest. therefore, the results for the latter one can be obtained by setting
the mass of the charged gauge elds to zero and subtracting the contributions
of the longitudinal spin projection of the massive charged gauge elds and the
goldstone elds. these transformations can be made freely. for instance, to get
the contribution of charged gluons to the one-loop ep it is sucient to substitute
the factor 3 by the factor 2 in the part of eq. (20) describing the contribution of
massless (m = 0) charged spin zero particles. the same has to be done to nd
either the debye mass of neutral gluons (in eq. (48)) or the temperature masses
of charged gluons (sect. 9), etc. below, for convenience of further account, we

36

adduce the necessary expressions [11].

from eqs. (83) and (84) it is seen that the imaginary terms are cancelled out in
the total. the nal ep is real if the condition unstable(h, t ) > gh holds.

this expression must be supplemented by the term describing the contribution
in one-loop order it gives a trivial h-independent
of the neutral gluon elds.
constant which can be omitted. however, these elds are long-range states and
they do give h-dependent ep through the correlation corrections including the
mass term 0(h, t ). corresponding part of the ep is described by the expression
which can be recognized from the case h = 0 [46], [15]:

where 0(h, t ) = 0
00(k = 0, h, t ) is the zero-zero component of the neutral
gluon polarization operator calculated in the external eld at nite temperature
and taken at zero momentum, c is eulers constant. the rst term in eq. (85)
has order  g2 in coupling constant, the second term is of order  g3 and the
last one -  g4. restricting ourselves by order  g3, it will be omitted in what
follows. as usually, for (h, t ) the high temperature limit of the function has to
be used. the expression (85) needs in one additional comment. if one compares
it with eq. (35), the dierence will be in the extra term  (t, h)t 2. we have
maintained this next-to-leading term because it is of great importance for prob-
lems under consideration. in studying of symmetry behaviour only the leading
(-independent) terms of the polarization functions were taking into account.

here, the rst term is the well known temperature mass squared and other ones

tant for what follows. sabstituting expression (86) into equation (85) we obtain
the correlation corrections due to neutral gluons.

the calculations, as we have described in sect 10., result in the high temper-

ature limits of unstable(h, t )

where the average values of the polarization operator in the corresponding states
of the spectrum (91) are computed. these formulae have been obtained in the
high temperature limit gh/t 2 << 1. the operator contains also an imaginary
part which describes the decay of the states. but for the problem under con-
sideration only the real part is needed because it is responsible for the radiation
masses of particles.

let us note the most important features of the expressions (87), (88). it is
seen, at h = 0 no screening magnetic mass is produced in one-loop order. second,
the mass squared of the modes are positive and act to stabilize the spectrum of
charged gluons at high temperatures. therefore, in the nonzero chromomagnetic
eld at nite temperature the charged transversal gluons become massive.

11.2 contribution of the daisy diagrams of charged gluons

to obtain the correlation corrections due to the logitudinal charged gluons the
zero-zero component of the polarization operator has to be calculated. the debye
mass of charged gluons is found to be [66]

and including the temperature masses (h, n, , t ) of the modes which are also
dependent on h, the level number, n, and the spin projection . in general, the
incorporation of the polarization functions into ep may result in wrong combi-
natoric factors for the two-loop diagrams. in our case, to be sure in the obtaining
results the following procedure is applied. we subtract the term

from eq.
(90), that separates the contributions of the two-loop diagrams of
charged gluons. one freely can check that the two-loop diagrams containing the
one of loops with the neutral gluon lines can be accounted of within the general-
ized ep including the insertion of the neutral gluon polarization operator. after
that the only two-loop diagram (two touch circles) allowing for the self-interaction
of charged gluon elds in the vacuum remains to be computed separately.

then, by substituting the expressions (87), (88), (89) into eq.

(90) and
integrating over momentum and calculating the sums in n, we obtain the daisy
diagram contribution of charged gluon elds. the result can be expressed in
terms of the generalized -function and looks as follows,

where the rst term in the rst squared brackets corresponds to the spin projec-
tion  = +1, the second term -  = 1 and the last one describes the part due
to longitudinal charged gluons. the terms in the second squared brackets give
the independent of (h, t ) part of eq. (90). the last term in the curly brackets
is due to radiation mass of the unstable mode. the notations are introduced:
ghd = gh + g2

substituting the expression (86) in eq. (85) and gethering all other contribu-

to calculate the two-loop vacuum diagram describing the self-interaction of
charged gluons the standard procedure can be applied. the computation details
are given in ref.
[11]. reering the readers to this paper, we write down here
the resulting expression for the high temperature limit

it also gives the negative contribution to the leading terms of the asymptotic
expansion since ( 1
2) = 0.8093. it worth to mention that these are the lon-
gitudinal modes that determine the high temperature behaviour of v (2)
ch (h, t ).
having obtained the two-loop corrections to the ep, one can investigate the spon-
taneous vacuum magnetization at high temperature.

11.3 vacuum magnetization and the stability problem

the derived ep is expressed through the well studied special functions. therefore,
it can easily be investigated numerically for any range of parameters entering.
as usually, it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless variables: the eld
 = (gh)1/2/t and the ep v(, g) = v (h, t )/t 4. the vacuum magnetization
at high temperatures, t >> (gh)1/2,   0, will be investigated within the
followin limiting form of the ep,

the dependence on the scale parameter . other terms present, respectively, the
high temperature limits of the one-loop ep, the neutral gluon and the charged
gluon daisyes and the two-loop diagram of charged gluons. to obtain the term

we are searching for the elds  of order larger then g2, we can omit the term g3
and obtain for the condensed eld

thus, we come to the result that the ferromagnetic vacuum state indeed exists
at high temperatures. the correlation corrections increase the eld strength as
compare to the one-loop value ( (gh)1/2

c  g2t ).

let us discuss the stability of the condensed eld. the second derivative
of the ep is positive for hc that means we have the minimum. the eld is
not changing in the direction a = 3 of the isotopic space. to check that this
is indeed the case for the perpendicular directions = 1, 2 or a = a responsi-
ble for excitation of charged elds w , one has to calculate the eective mass
squared m 2(hc, t ). first we consider the one-loop case. sabstituting the value
c )1/2 = (g2/2)t in the one-loop polarization function, we nd that the
(gh (1)
eective mass squared, m 2(h (1)
c  0,
is positive. thus, the vacuum stabilization is observed in this consisten calcula-
tion. however, if one checks whether the one-loop gluon radiation mass stabilize
the true vacuum magnetic eld and substitutes the value (ghc)1/2  g4/3t, the
negative value of m 2(hc, t ) will be obtained. the one-loop mass does not sta-
bilize the spectrum and, hence, vacuum. nevertheless, the one-loop result makes
hopeful the idea to have the stable vacuum due to radiation corrections to the
charged gluon spectrum. naturally, to investigate this possibility the gluon po-
larization operator with the correlation corrections included should be calculated.
this problem requirs an an additional investigation. other interesting possibility
is the formation at high temperatures of the gluon electrostatic potential, so-
called a0 condensate (see survey [68]), which also acts as a stabilizing factor [17].
to realize the latter scenario consistently the simultaneous spontaneous gener-
ation of both the a0 condensate and the magnetic eld should be investigated.
if again the homogeneous vacuum eld will be found to be unstable with these
improvements made, the inhomogeneous elds of the lattice type discussed in
refs.
[36], [43], [58] can be created. really, since the condensed magnetic eld
is strong at high temperatures, the lattice structures having the cells of order
 1/(g4/3t ) << 1/(g2t ) are located inside the domain where the elds are not
screened by the gluon magnetic mass.
the above calculations have unambiguously determined the possibility of the
vacuum magnetization at high temperature, although a number of questions con-
cerning the vacuum stabilization and structure has to be investigated in order to
derive a nal picture. this could result in the presence of strong magnetic elds
in the hot universe.

41

12. comparison with other approaches

in this section we are going to compare our results with that of other investiga-
tions. that refer to either the phase transition or the generation of the magnetic
eld at high temperature. we begin with discussion of the ew phase transition
in strong hypermagnetic elds.

first let us discuss the results of refs.

[6], [8] where it was concluded that
strong external hypermagnetic eld generates the suciently strong rst order
phase transition and baryogenesis survives in the sm. in these papers the inence
of the eld on the vacuum has been allowed for in tree approximation that gives
the qualitative estimate of the eect. in ref. [8] the temperature dependent part
of the ep has been included in one-loop order whereas the eld dependence was
skipped. naturally, further studying of the phenomenon should include the eld
dependent radiation and correlation corrections due to fermions and bosons. this
is the problem that we have addressed to in the present investigation. the main
idea was to determine the form of the ep curve in the broken phase and nd
the range of the parameters hy , k when the ew phase transition of rst order
is happened. to elaborate that the consistent ep including the one-loop and
daisy diagrams of all the fundamental particles has been calculated. as we have
discovered, the role of fermions is crucial in a vacuum dynamics in strong elds
at high temperature. they essentially aect the structure of the broken phase
making the ew phase transition weaker as compare to the tree level results.
the external eld has been accounted of exactly through greens functions. the
minimum of the ep was found to be real at sucently high temperatures when
the rst order phase transition happens. this important property was established
when the daisy diagrams of the tachyonic mode have been included. as a result,
no conditions for w - and z-boson condensates are observed at high temperatures
and the external eld strengths corresponding to the rst order phase transition.
the condensates could be generated for stronger elds when the phase transition
becomes of second order. but, this is not of interest here since we are looking for
conditions when baryogenesis can survive.

in refs. [9], [67] the ew phase transition in the hypermagnetic eld has been
investigated by means of a general method developed in ref. [71] (see also survey
[13]) which combines the perturbative computations and the lattice simulations.
the results obtained therein have supported the main conclusions of refs.
[6],
[8] discussed above. in more detail, it was found for the elds hy < 0.3t 2 the
rst order phase transition becomes stronger, but it still turns into a crossover
for masses mh  80 gev. for stronger elds, a mixed phase analogous to a rst
type superconductor with a single macroscopic tube of symmetric phase, parallel
to hy , penetrating through the broken phase, has been observed.

as this aproach is concerned, we note that because of peculiarities of the
calculation procedure adopted in ref. [9] all fermions except t-quarks are decou-
pled as nonstatic modes and therefore the eld dependent fermion contributions

42

as well as the correlation corrections could not be accounted of. that is why
these calculations also do not reproduce correctly symmetry behaviour for strong
external elds.

in the present approach, the value of the mass mh = 75 gev ( = 0.85) is close
to mh = 80 gev discussed in ref. [9]. this is important for us because the rst
order phase transition is controlled by perturbative method used. but we could
not observe the mixed phase. we have seen the crossover (or second order phase
transition) for hy = 1023 g and k = 0.85 determined within the asymptotic ep.
the exact ep in this case predicts the weak rst-order phase transition. since
the ep is real in the minimum, no conditions for the vortex-like phase exist.

the higgs boson mass values considered correspond to the cases when per-
turbative results are reliable (k = 0.85) and may be not trusty (k = 1.25 ,
2). however, since the external eld is taken into account exactly its eects
are correctly reproduced. as we have seen, an increase in hy makes the ew
phase transition of second order for eld strengths hy  0.5  1024g for all the
values of k investigated. for weaker elds the phase transition is of rst order
but the ratio r = c(h, tc)/tc is less then unit, that is unsucient to generate
baryogenesis.

let us remind the situation with the magnetic eld when the magnetic mass of
order mmag  g2t is taken into consideration. this mass screens the nonabelian
component ha3 at distancies l > lm  (g2t )1 but inside the space domain
l < lm it may exist and aect all the processes at high temperatures. the latter
fact has not been realized in a number of investigations [34], [35] where (as in
ref. [20]) the eld strength generated at nite temperature has been erroneously
estimated as coinsiding with that at zero temperature. our estimate of the eld
strength at high temparature makes the investigation of the ew phase transition
in strong magnetic elds resonable. but, as we have seen in sect. 9, in this case
it also is impossible to generate the strong rst order phase transition.

now, let us consider in more detail the problems of the magnetic eld gen-
eration and stabilization at high temperature.
in the present survey we have
investigated in detail the savvidy mechanism. the ways of the vacuum stabi-
lization have also been discussed. in this scenario, usual magnetic eld should
be treated as the projection of the chromomagnetic eld created in a nonabelian
gauge theory. results of our investigation disagree with that of refs.
[34], [35]
where it is claimed that spontaneous magnetization does not hold at high temper-
ature. to clarify the origin of the discrepancy let us repeat the main statements
of refs. [34], [35]: 1) the eld strength generated at nite temperature gh  2
, where 2 = 2exp( 482
11n g2() ), coinsides with that at zero temperature. this is
much less than the magnetic mass squared  (g2t )2. 2) since the spectrum of
charged particles in the magnetic eld is formed at the larmor radius scale, the
weak long range elds are not produced being screened by the mass at distances
l  1/g2t. the error is the assumption that the eld strength generated in the

43

vaccum is not changed when the temperature is switched on. as we have seen
in sect. 11, strong abelian colour magnetic elds of order (gh)1/2  g2t (in
one-loop approximation [17], [19]) or (gh)1/2  g4/3t [11] (when higher order
corrections are included) is spontaneously generated at hight temperture.
we also have observed in the consistent calculation that the savvidy state
is stable at high temperature when the one-loop ep and the one-loop gluon
polarization operator are taken into account.

13. discussion

as it was realized recently, in the sm the usual scenario of baryogenesis can not be
established without external elds [13]. by analogy to superconductivity it was
assumed that strong hypermagnetic eld is able to generate the strong rst order
phase transition for the values of mass mh permitted by experiment [6]. dierent
mechanisms to produce magnetic elds have been proposed in literature. they
can be devided in two groups: 1) generation of elds at ew phase transition [22],
[23], [24], [25], [26]; 2) generation of elds beyond the sm scale (for instance, gut
theories) [4], [20]. a special interest was in strong hypermagnetic eld which due
to its abalian nature is not screened at high temperature whereas the nonabelian
component of the usual magnetic eld is screened at distances l > 1/g2t by the
gauge eld magnetic mass. the inuence of the magnetic elds generated at the
ew scale on the rst order phase transition was investigated in ref.
it
has been shown that if the eld strength is stronger then h0 = 1024 g the phase
transition is delayed. of cause, it is relevant if the rst order phase transition
is realized. but this is not the case for the sm, where without external elds
for the mass mh  60  70 gev the second order phase transition is predicted.
naturally, internal forses are not able to change the kind of the phase transition.
the investigations carried out in the present paper are refered to the second
possibility assuming that the elds have been generated before the ew phase
transition at a gut scale. the dynamics of the hypermagnetic eld generation
has not been discussed here, although the corresponding machanism was proposed
in ref. [7]. we just assumed that the eld present in the early universe. as the
magnetic eld is concerned, in sects. 10, 11 we have investigated in detail its
generation and stabilization at high temperature.

[27].

the results on the hypermagnetic eld inuence can be summarised as follows.
in contrast to the conclusions of refs. [8], [9] claiming that strong hypermagnetic
eld generates the strong rst order ew phase transition, we observed an opposite
eect. as we have seen in our numerical computations, the weak rst-order ew
phase thansition bacomes of second order in strong elds. the origin of the
discrepancy is the following. these authors have not determined correctly the
form of the ep curve at the transition temperature since the contributions of
fermions and the correlation corrections in the elds were skipped. in fact, our
analysis has completed the investigations not only for the hypermagnetic but

44

mf

also for the magnetic eld. we have discovered that the role of fermion radiation
corrections is of great importance in the phenomenon investigated. to better
understand the role of fermions in symmetry behaviour let us adduce two terms
of the asymptotic expansion of the ep in the limit of t  , h  . the rst
one is the term  h 2log t
. due to this term the light fermions are dominating
at high temperature. the second term can be derived from the expansion of the
zero temperature part eq. (32). this expression side by side with the leading
term  h 2log eh
, which due to a dimension parameter trading is replaced by
the above written term, contains the subleading one  ehm2
(for details
see ref. [29]). this term acts to make heavier the higgs particles in the eld.
as a result, the second order temperature phase transition is stimulated due to
strong elds. we also have investigated the inuence of dierent parts of the ep
on symmetry behaviour.
it was discovered that the change of the kind of the
ew phase transition with increase in h is due to the fermion temperature part
of the ep.

the stability problem of the vacuum at high temperature and strong elds
has also been investigated. our ep (its minima) is real at the rst order phase
transition that is important for the reliability of the results obtained. the lat-
ter property is insured by the imaginary terms of daisy diagrams cancelling the
corresponding ones of the one-loop ep. thus, the total ep is sutable to correctly
describe the phase transition. as we have found, the eective w-boson mass
mw(h, t ) is real in the local minimum, therefore no conditions for the forma-
tion of the vortex-like structure due to w- and z-boson condensates exist in the
broken phase. probably, this is the reason why the condensates have not been
observed in ref. [9], although it is dicult to check that strightforwardly.

furthermore, we have also shown that spontaneous vacuum magnetization in-
deed happens at high temperature giving the reliable mechanism of the magnetic
eld generation at a gut scale. in principle, the eld could be spontaneously cre-
ated at the ew scale. however, in this case it is incorrect to treat the ew phase
transition as the external eld problem. it is necessary to apply consideration as
in ref. [27].

on the base of our analysis one has to conclude that baryogenesis can not
survive in the sm if smooth external magnetic elds generated beyond the ew
scale are included as environment.

as a nal remark, we would like to stress once again that light fermions act to
turn the rst order phase transition into the second order one with increase in the
eld strength, independently of the values of the higgs boson mass considered.
this fact may be one of the reasons why it is of interest to carry out a similar
investigation for the minimal supersymmertic sm or other supersymmetric ex-
tensions of it, because the fermion and the boson sectors enter such models on
an equal footing.

appendix

general method of calculation of high temperature asymptotics has been devel-
oped in ref.
[64]. to outline the procedure used in the present paper let us
consider the fermion contribution as an example:

f (1)
r =



xn=1

(1)nk|r|(n).

(a.1)

at rst, let us make mellins transformation of k|r|(n) with respect to parameter
n [64]:

k|r|(s) =



z0

k|r|(t)ts1dt = s2s2(cid:18) s

2  |r|

2 (cid:19)(cid:18) s

2

+ |r|
2 (cid:19),

where (x) is -function, and substitute it in eq. (a.1). then we nd

f (1)
r =

)s(cid:18) s

+ |r|
2 (cid:19),

(a.2)

where cr > |r| and the integral is calculated along the straight line parallel to
if one shifts the integration variable s  s  r = s, the
the imaginary axis.
integration contour moves to the right, c2r  c2r, for negative r, and to the left,
cr  c0, in the case of positive r: 2r < c2r < 2r  1; 0 < c0 < 1. changing
the sequence of the summation and the integration in eq. (a.2) and taking into
account the denition of riemanns -function [75]

(1)n
ns = (21s  1)(s),

one obtains

r =

)s+r(cid:18)s

2  |r|

2 (cid:19)(cid:18)s

2

+ |r|
2 (cid:19).

(a.3)

it is important to note that the contours c2r, c0 are the same as for k|r|(x) after
shifting of integration variable s  s. the integral (a.3) is calculated by closing

46

the contour c to the left and summing up the residua of the integrand. for
the contour c2r one should include all the poles of  and  -functions. but for
positive r, 0 < c0 < 1, the pole s = 1 of -function is out of the contour and
should be excluded.

in the case of fermion contributions the following integrals have to be calcu-

lated:

f (1)
