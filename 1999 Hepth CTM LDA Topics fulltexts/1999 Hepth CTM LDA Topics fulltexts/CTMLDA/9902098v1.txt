we review a formalism of superstring quantization with manifest six-dimensional spacetime
supersymmetry, and apply it to ads3  s3 backgrounds with ramond-ramond ux. the
resulting description is a conformal eld theory based on a sigma model whose target space
is a certain supergroup su (2|2).

1. introduction

in the rns formulation of superstring theory, powerful conformal eld theory methods

of computation are available. a price one pays is that spacetime supersymmetry is not

visible as a classical symmetry of the worldsheet action. it can be seen by incorporating

spin elds and picture changing [1]. on the other hand, the green-schwarz description [2]

makes spacetime supersymmetry manifest, but quantization becomes dicult, except in

light cone gauge.

though a fully covariant quantization of the green-schwarz string is not known, one

does know a partial substitute in that it is possible to reformulate the rns description

in terms of green-schwarz-like variables, in a way that makes manifest a portion of the

spacetime symmetry group. for example [3], one can exhibit four-dimensional poincare

invariance with manifest n = 1 supersymmetry (or, for type ii superstrings, n = 1 from

left-movers and n = 1 from right-movers), giving a framework in which one can study

superstring compactication on a calabi-yau manifold, with all symmetries more or less

manifest. by a further extension of these ideas [4], one can exhibit six-dimensional n = 1

super-poincare invariance (or n = 1 for left-movers and n = 1 for right-movers), giving

a framework in which all symmetries of superstring compactication on a k3 surface are

visible. these constructions are hybrids in which the spacetime symmetries of four or six

of the ten dimensions are described in green-schwarz-like variables, while the remaining

dimensions are described using rns variables. these constructions may thus loosely, but

only loosely, be described as covariant quantization of the green-schwarz string in four or

six dimensions. there also exists a quantization of the ten-dimensional superstring which,

after wick-rotating, preserves manifest u (5) super-poincare invariance [5].

one important property of the rns approach to type ii superstrings is that in the

rns case, some of the bosonic elds  those from the ramond-ramond sector  are

represented by spin elds. as a result, it is exceedingly dicult to describe and understand

backgrounds in which ramond-ramond or rr elds are present in the vacuum. at best,

one would have to describe such backgrounds by worldsheet lagrangians with spin elds

added to the action, leading at least generically to rather untransparent formulas.

in

addition, there are several questions of principle. a narrow one is simply that one must

ask in which picture or pictures one should take the ramond-ramond vertex operators

that are added to the lagrangian. a broader question is this: what is supposed to replace

worldsheet superconformal symmetry? superconformal invariance is usually understood

1

as the guiding principle of the rns description of perturbative superstrings. however,

in the presence of rr elds, the superconformal symmetry is violated (as the worldsheet

supercurrents are not local with respect to a ramond-ramond eld), and it is not at all

clear even in principle what would constitute a satisfactory worldsheet action with rr

elds.

the partially covariant methods mentioned before give an answer in principle, at

least in certain special cases.

if the rr elds live only in the four or six dimensions

whose spacetime symmetries are manifest in the constructions of [3] or [4], then their

vertex operators are ordinary untwisted worldsheet operators and can be added to the

lagrangian while sticking within a known framework in which the rules are all clear. for
example, to leading order in an  expansion, a sigma model containing four-dimensional

rr elds has been constructed in [6]. although explicit -function computations have

not yet been done for this sigma model representing the type ii superstring, there have

been -function computations [7] in d = 4 superspace for a closely related sigma model

representing the heterotic superstring. the analogous sigma model construction has not

been made in six dimensions either for the heterotic or type ii superstring.

the problem of describing conformal eld theories with rr elds has acquired greater

currency because of the much-studied dualities [8] between string theories on anti de sitter

or ads backgrounds that contain rr elds and certain conformal eld theories. in the

context of these dualities, it would be highly desireable to be able to construct conformal

eld theories representing backgrounds with rr elds. in the absence of an ability to do

so, one is limited to studying certain limits of ads theories in which supergravity is an

adequate approximation.

the purpose of the present paper is to use the covariant green-schwarz-like methods

mentioned above to construct a conformal eld theory description of a particular ads
background with rr elds. this will be the type iib compactication on ads3  s3  k3
(or ads3  s3 t4). in fact, we will study the ads3 s3 examples with a general mixture
of rr and neveu-schwarz uxes. though the details are complicated, the general outline
of the answer that we will get is easily stated. ads3  s3 will be represented by a sigma
model whose target space is a certain supergroup that we call su (2|2); this sigma model
is conformally invariant because of special properties of that supergroup. the sigma model
with target space su (2|2) depends on two parameters, which correspond physically to the
rr and ns uxes. for any values of the uxes, this sigma model is highly nonunitary,

because for example the worldsheet fermions have a second order kinetic energy; physical

2

states will be those obeying a certain fairly elaborate set of constraints. except in the
special case that the rr ux vanishes, the su (2|2) sigma model must be supplemented
with couplings of matter elds to ghost-like elds.

we should mention other approaches that give somewhat complementary information.
the ads3  s3 models have cousins with ns elds [9] that can be described as conformal
eld theories using rns variables [10,11]. one important ingredient in this approach is the

sl(2, r) wzw model, which has been studied from many points of view (for example, see

[12]). also, there are extremely elegant descriptions of ads backgrounds with rr elds,
including ads3s3, at the classical level (for example, see [13]). those descriptions involve
strings in superspace, usually a superspace with more odd variables than will appear in

our discussion, and with compensating  symmetry. there have also been attempts at
ads3  s3 quantization in light cone and temporal gauges [14].

this paper is organized as follows. because the methods we will use are comparatively

little-known, we begin in sections 2-5 with an unusually detailed review and summary of

previous work. the reader should not assume that everything in these sections (especially

sections 2 and 3) is needed for understanding the rest of the paper. in section 6, we begin
with r6  k3 (or r6  t4) and describe vertex operators that, locally and to rst order,
deform r6 to ads3  s3 with rr elds. many general lessons become clear from this
linearized treatment. using those lessons, we construct in section 7 the conformal eld

theory  as mentioned before, a sigma model with target a certain supergroup  that
describes ads3  s3. then in section 8, we analyze the necesssary ghost couplings and
show their consistency with the framework reviewed in sections 2-5. in section 9, we dene

the conditions which physical vertex operators have to satisfy in the conformal eld theory.
in section 10, we study the ads3  s3 models with ns background in the same framework.
though this is unnecessary, in the sense that conformal eld theory descriptions of

these backgrounds are already known, our approach has the virtue of making spacetime

supersymmetry manifest  at the cost, we must admit, of a certain complexity.

there is one point of physics that we should perhaps mention here. one important
route to the ads3  s3 backgrounds with rr ux begins with r6  k3 (or r6  t4) with
parallel dirichlet onebranes and vebranes in r6 (the vebranes being wrapped on k3 or
t4 to make strings in r6). let q1 and q5 be the number of such strings or vebranes.
(physically, one can also add threebranes wrapped on two-cycles in k3 or t4 to make

additional strings, but in this case the methods we will use are much less eective, as
the resulting rr ux does not live just in r6.) these integer variables determine the

3

amount of rr ux on the s3 factor in ads3  s3, and also the volume of the k3 or t4. in
our work, however, we will not see any quantization of either of those variables. one way

to explain the reason is as follows. let  be the string coupling constant. the number of
rr ux quanta needed to make an ads3  s3 background that remains xed as   0 is
of order 1/. since (by doing conformal eld theory) we are working in the small  limit,

the integrality of a quantity that is of order 1/ is not readily visible. for example, the

number of wrapped dirichlet vebranes equals the number of rr ux quanta on s3. to
see integrality of this number, one should study d-strings on ads3  s3, rather than the
elementary strings that we will in fact be studying.

by contrast, integrality of the ns ux can be probed by elementary strings. if one
considers on r6  k3 ns vebranes as well as dirichlet vebranes, one gets an ads3  s3
model with ns as well as rr ux. the ns ux appears as a wess-zumino coupling in
the su (2|2) sigma model, which is quantized for topological reasons. integrality of the
number of ns vebranes is thus manifest in our formalism.

some of the massless scalar moduli in r6  k3 (or similarly r6  t4) get masses
when one goes to ads3  s3  k3. in fact, one scalar in each tensor multiplet gets mass.
this is a consequence of the structure of the ads3  s3 supermultiplets, and hence will
automatically be true in the framework we are developing here. however, we will not
describe the vertex operators for disturbances in ads3  s3 in the present paper and so
will not see the phenomenon explicitly.

2. n = 2 and n = 4 topological strings

the aim of this section is to recall the denition of n = 2 [15] and n = 4 [4]

topological strings. then we will proceed in section 3 to review how the superstring can

be formulated in the language of n = 4 topological string theory, and in section 4 to review

how this formalism can be used to give a description of the superstring with manifest d = 6

spacetime supersymmetry. in section 5, we will review the massless vertex operators in

this spacetime-supersymmetric description of the superstring.

4

2.1. n = 2 topological strings

the n = 2 topological string is modeled after ordinary n = 0 bosonic strings. thus

to motivate it, we rst recall what general ingredients are needed for dening a bosonic

string theory.

in bosonic string perturbation theory, the key elements are a two-dimensional confor-
mal eld theory with certain additional structures.1 one requires a spin 1 fermionic brst

current jbrst ; the charge associated to it is the brst operator

qbrst =i jbrst

and obeys q2
brst = 0. jbrst has charge one with respect to a ghost number symmetry,
which is generated by a ghost current jghost that has an anomaly 3g  3 on a riemann
surface of genus g. in addition there is a spin 2 antighost eld b with ghost number 1,
which satises

{q, b(z)} = t (z)

(2.1)

where t is the total energy momentum tensor of the system (including both the matter
and ghost system). t has central charge 0. moreover (b)2  0 (in the sense that there is
no short distance singularity in the b  b operator product). the physical elds are dened
relative to qbrst cohomology. a physical eld is dened to be a ghost number 1 eld +
that obeys

with the gauge equivalence relation being

{qbrst , +} = 0,

+  + + {qbrst , }.

for conventional bosonic strings, one can prove from the structure of the brst cohomology

that every physical eld, modulo the gauge equivalence relation, has a representative that

is a primary eld of the virasoro algebra of dimension 0. we will assume in general that
+ has this property. let b1+ denote the single pole in the ope of b with +. (in
what follows, in general, if o is an operator of dimension d, on will signify the pole of

order d + n in the ope of o with .) then the operatorr b1+ has dimension one and

so is a marginal deformation that can be used to give a deformation of the action. by

1 we will concentrate on left-movers and will denote right-movers with barred notation.

5

virtue of the properties explained above, the operator r b1+ has ghost number zero,

is brst invariant modulo a surface term, and commutes with b. so adding it to the

action preserves the structure we have assumed for the denition of the theory, namely the

conformal invariance, brst invariance, ghost symmetry, and the existence of b.

now, let us consider the theory formulated on a genus g riemann surface. the
moduli space of such surfaces is a complex 3g  3 dimensional space mg. the tangent
vectors on it are identied with beltrami dierentials z
z on the corresponding riemann
surface. beltrami dierentials are equivalent if they dier by vz where vz is a globally

dened vector eld on the riemann surface. modulo this relation, the space of beltrami
dierentials has dimension 3g  3 (for g > 1). note that since b is a spin 2 current, i.e., it
is a quadratic dierential on the riemann surface, the integral

b() =z bzzz

z

makes sense on the riemann surface. the n -point genus g bosonic string scattering

amplitude is dened by

fg =zmgyi
h(cid:12)(cid:12)

3g3yi=1

b(i)(cid:12)(cid:12)2

nyr=1z b1b1++

(r) i

(2.2)

where the i x the volume element on mg and ++
with respect to both left and right-movers.

(r) satises the physicality conditions
it is easy to check that this denition is

consistent with the notion of physical states dened above.
in particular, if we add a
term q to one of the +
(r), this does not aect the genus g partition function. also note
that in order for fg not to be trivially zero, the ghost current needs to have an anomaly.
in particular, there must be 3g  3 units of ghost charge generated by the path-integral
measure in order to balance the 3g  3 anti-ghost b elds in the denition of fg.

now we are ready to discuss n = 2 topological strings. start with any n = 2
superconformal eld theory. this will have currents t , g, and j of spins 2, 3
2 , and 1,
respectively, where t is the energy momentum tensor, j is the u (1) current, and g are
the two supercurrents with charge 1 under j. the energy-momentum tensor can be
modied or twisted by

t  t  = t 

1
2

j.

(or the same formula with + 1
2 j instead). one can show that t  generates a virasoro
algebra. passing from t to t  shifts the dimension of every eld by 1/2 its u (1) charge.

6

so with respect to t , g+ has spin 1 and g has spin 2. moreover, the modied energy

momentum tensor has zero central charge no matter what was the central charge c of the

underlying n = 2 theory that we started with. now we see we have exactly the same

structure as needed in the denition of bosonic string with the following identications:

t  t 

jbrst  g+

b  g

jghost  j.

in particular, (2.2) now takes the form

fg =zmgyi
h(cid:12)(cid:12)

3g3yi=1

g(i)(cid:12)(cid:12)2

nyr=1z g

1g


1++
(r) i

(2.3)

translating the conditions for the physical elds, we see that they correspond to chiral

primary elds with charge +1 and dimension 0 (they arise from operators that have charge

1 and dimension 1

2 before twisting).

note also that nonvanishing of the partition function puts a strong constraint on

the anomaly of the u (1) current. unless the anomaly of the n = 2 u (1) current is
3g3 at genus g, the partition function trivially vanishes and we must consider correlation
functions of suitable physical states instead. if the anomaly is precisely 3g3, the partition
function will generally not vanish. the anomaly arises from a two point function j  t  =
j  (t  1
2 j). since the j  t two point function vanishes (by virtue of the underlying
n = 2 algebra), the anomaly comes from j  j, and hence is proportional to the central
charge c of the n = 2 algebra. the anomaly is in fact given precisely by by c(g  1), so
c = 3 is the case for which the partition function need not a priori vanish. an important

example of an n = 2 model with c = 3 is the supersymmetric sigma model with target

space a calabi-yau threefold.

7

2.2. n = 4 topological strings

let us consider an n = 4 superconformal theory and see how one can make a string

theory out of that, as we have just done for n = 2 superconformal theories. by an n = 4

theory, we mean a superconformal theory with the small n = 4 algebra, which has one
spin 2 energy momentum tensor t , four spin 3
2 fermionic currents g, and three spin
1 currents j a forming an su (2) current algebra. we write the supercurrents as ga,i,
a, i = 1, 2, obeying in a unitary theory a reality condition ga,i = abij g
b,j. the su (2)
symmetry that is part of the n = 4 algebra acts on the rst index of ga,i. acting on

the second index is an additional su (2) symmetry, which we call su (2)outer, that acts by
outer automorphisms on the n = 4 algebra. some n = 4 theories have su (2)outer as a
symmetry (for instance, the sigma model with target the at hyper-kahler manifold r4)

but many others do not (for instance, a sigma model with target a k3 surface).

in order to dene the n = 4 topological string, it is convenient to rst view the n = 4

superconformal theory as an n = 2 superconformal theory. to pick an n = 2 subalgebra

in an n = 4 theory, we proceed as follows. first we choose, from among the su (2)
currents j a, a linear combination that we will regard as the u (1) current j of an n = 2

algebra. however, even when j is given, an n = 2 subalgebra of the n = 4 algebra is not

uniquely determined. with respect to j, there are two supercurrents of charge 1, which we
may denote as g+,i, i = 1, 2. we may take any linear combination of these to be the g+
generator of an n = 2 algebra (g will then be xed as the hermitian conjugate of g+).

the rst choice, namely the choice of j, is inessential in the sense that the dierent choices

give equivalent theories; they dier by su (2) rotations. however, the choice of which linear
combination of the g+,i we call g+ contains essential information. the choices can indeed

be rotated to each other by su (2)outer, but in general, as we have noted, su (2)outer is
not a symmetry of the theory. so the dierent choices are inequivalent.

if we denote the g+,i as g+ and eg+, then we can take the g+ generator in the n = 2

algebra to be

su (2)outer

.

u (1)

8

dg+(u) = u1g+ + u2eg+

for any complex constants u1, u2. if the ui are multiplied by a common factor, we get the
same n = 2 algebra, so the choices are parametrized by a copy of cp1. we can think of
this cp1 as a two-sphere that is a homogeneous space of the group su (2)outer; it can be
identied as

as we have stressed, since the su (2)outer is an outer automorphism of the algebra and is

not necessarily a symmetry of the theory, the dierent us will give inequivalent imbeddings

of the n = 2 superconformal algebra in n = 4. for any choice of the ui, normalized to
|u1|2 + |u2|2 = 1, we pick the basis

dg+(u) = u1g+ + u2eg+
deg(u) = u2g + u1eg
dg(u) = u
2eg
deg+(u) = u
1eg+.
m =(cid:18) u1
1(cid:19) .

u2
2 u

u

1g + u

2g+ + u

these formulas have been obtained as follows. we have regarded (u1, u2) as the top row

of an su (2)outer matrix

(2.4)

by this group element to get the above basis.

then we have transformed the two su (2)outer doublets, namely (g+,eg) and (eg+, g),
either (g+, g) or (eg+,eg), or their transforms by m , can be used to form the two

supercurrents of an n = 2 algebra. moreover, the opes

have no singularities.

g+eg  0

geg+  0

we now construct an n = 2 twisted theory by modifying the energy momentum tensor
as explained before: t  t  1
2 j. since this operation shifts the dimension of every eld
by  1
2 its u (1) charge, the twisted theory has the following symmetry currents. there are
two bosonic spin 2 elds, namely the modied energy momentum tensor t  and the su (2)
current j , and two fermionic spin 2 currents g,eg. moreover, there are two spin 1
fermionic currents g+,eg+ and a bosonic spin one current j. in addition, there is a spin

0 bosonic current of su (2), namely j ++.

now we have to decide which elds in the twisted theory we would like to identify as

physical. in the case of n = 2 topological theories, we identied the physical spectrum
with the cohomology of g+, i.e. with the space of elds annihilated by g+ modulo addition
of elds of the form g+. now we have in principle two brst charges, because both g+

surface since it hits the j and gives back eg+ as the residue. for the same reason, adding
h eg+ to the action may change the partition function. however, if we consider adding
h g+h eg+ to the action, then the eg+ contour can be pulled o of  and converts the j
to a eg+. now pulling the g+ contour o of , we encounter no residues from eg+. from

the gs, we get residues which are the energy momentum tensor, thus giving us total

2.3. critical n = 2 string as an n = 4 topological string

one class of n = 4 theories that is important for our purposes is the following. one

can construct a small n = 4 superconformal theory from any c = 2 n = 2 superconformal

theory by dening the three su(2) currents to be j, er j and er j , and dening the four
fermionic generators to be g+, g, [er j , g+] and [er j , g]. note that c must equal 2
(i.e. the associated n = 2 string is critical) in order that er j has spin 1. 3

is computing for these n = 4 strings. as was

it is interesting to ask what f (m,n)

g

g

computes the n = 2 scattering amplitude on a surface of left-

shown in reference [4], f (m,n)
moving instanton number m and right-moving instanton number n. in other words, after
introducing the usual set of n = 2 super-reparameterization ghosts, with c = 6, one can
construct brst-invariant vertex operators for the critical n = 2 string which are in one-

to-one correspondence with the physical vertex operators of the n = 4 topological string.

furthermore, one can compute n = 2 correlation functions of these vertex operators on

an n = 2 super-riemann surface of genus g and left and right-moving instanton number

m and n, and after integrating over the n = 2 super-moduli of this riemann surface

(including the fermionic and u (1) moduli), one recovers precisely the n = 4 topological
formula f (m,n)

for the appropriate n = 4 physical vertex operators.

3. the superstring as an n = 4 topological string

we will now review how the usual superstring (which is conventionally described as a

critical n = 1 string) can also be described as an n = 2 string with c = 2, and therefore

also as an n = 4 topological string. the advantage of the n = 4 topological description

3 an important example of this construction is the following. in general, the supersymmetric
sigma model with target a calabi-yau n-fold is an n = 2 superconformal model with c = n. to

get n = 4 supersymmetry, the target should be hyper-kahler. the condition c = 2 amounts to

n = 2. a calabi-yau two-fold is always hyper-kahler, and that is why the c = 2 case automotically

gives n = 4 superconformal symmetry.

13

of the superstring is that, after a eld-redenition to green-schwarz-like variables, some

of the spacetime supersymmetry can be made manifest. in this paper, we will be mainly

interested in type iib superstring compactications on k3, which admit sixteen unbroken
spacetime supersymmetries. (we can also consider compactication on t4, but in that

case our construction exhibits only some of the unbroken supersymmetries.) as will be

reviewed below, eight of these sixteen supersymmetries will be manifest in the formalism

(i.e. act geometrically on the target superspace), while the other eight can be exhibited

in terms of ordinary vertex operators (as opposed to spin operators) but do not arise just

from geometrical symmetries of the target superspace.

we shall rst construct the n = 4 superconformal generators for the rns superstring

and prove that the physical n = 4 vertex operators are in one-to-one correspondence with

the usual brst-invariant rns vertex operators. we shall then show that the n = 4
topological amplitude f (m,n)
superstring amplitude where the total left and right-moving picture of the vertex operators

dened in the previous section computes the rns g-loop

g

is m and n.

3.1. n=4 superconformal generators and physical vertex operators

as discussed in [16], any critical n = 1 string can be embedded into a critical n = 2

string. this embedding allows n = 1 string scattering amplitudes to be computed using

n = 2 string methods.

the critical n = 2 superconformal generators are constructed from the n = 1 matter

and ghost elds as follows:

t = tn=1 +

(bc + ),

(3.1)

g+ = gm + c(tm 

3
2

 

1
2

  bc)  2b + 2c + (c),

g = b,

j = cb + 

where tn=1 = tm + tg is the stress-tensor of the original n = 1 matter and ghost elds,
and the (, ) super-reparameterization ghosts have been bosonized as ( = ie,  =
ie).4 for instance, the zero mode of g+ is the n = 1 brst operator q and after
4 the factors of i have been put in the bosonization formula so that  is real, i.e.   =

ie= ie = .

14

twisting (which in this case amounts to removing the term 1
2 (bc + ) from t ), g+ has
conformal weight 1 while g has conformal weight 2. furthermore, j is related to the

usual ghost current jghost = cb +  by

j = jghost  jpicture

where jpicture is the picture-current dened as jpicture = +. note that p =h jpicture

commutes with the  and  ghosts, but not with  or . moreover, we can write

i j = qghost  p

(3.2)

where qghost =h jghost is the ghost number.

since one now has a critical n = 2 string, one can ask what does the n = 4 topological

scattering amplitude dened in the previous section compute? to answer this, rst note

that the additional n = 4 generators (constructed as in subsection 2.3) are given by

eg+ = ,
eg = b(egm + e2b  c)  (tm 

j ++ = c,

3

j  = b.

(3.3)

 + 2bc  cb) + 2,

so physical n = 4 topological vertex operators + are dened by the conditions (2.6),

i.e.

q+ = 0+ = (qghost  p  1)+ = 0, +  + + q0.

but these are just the physical conditions for a brst-invariant vertex operator in the
standard rns formalism. note that the condition 0+ = 0 implies that  is independent
of the  zero mode (i.e. it can be written in terms of the unfermionized  and  ghosts)
and, similarly, the triviality condition + = q0 implies that + = q for some 
which is independent of the  zero mode (i.e. 0 = 0). furthermore, (g  p  1)+ = 0
is the usual ghost-number condition for physical elds.5

5 for ns states at zero picture, it implies that g = 1 as desired. for r states at picture
1/2, it implies that g = 1/2 as desired. all rns physical states at other pictures are related to

these pictures by multiplication by the picture-raising operator z = {q, } or the picture-lowering

operator y = ce2. but the operators z and y commute withh j , so these other physical
states also satisfy the condition (h j  1)+ = 0.

15

3.2. n = 4 topological amplitudes as rns superstring amplitudes

in terms of the rns variables, the scattering amplitude dened in (2.7) (or in (2.8)

at u2 = u2 = 0) is

f (2g2,2g2)

note that if we are in the large rns hilbert space, i.e. including the  zero mode,

then the only  zero mode in this expression comes from the j current bc + . after

integrating out the  zero mode, one is left with the integration

although these  integrations over the cycles look strange, they can be understood as

coming from the integration over the (, ) ghosts in the bosonized form of the standard
rns model [17] 6. the rest of (3.4) is just the standard rns scattering amplitude when
the total (left,right)-moving picture of the vertex operators ++

(r) is (2g  2, 2g  2).

to obtain the scattering amplitude when the vertex operators are in other pictures,

z eg

6 as discussed in [17], one needs to also insert -functions in the momentum of the  eld
to restrict the picture of states propagating in the internal loops. these -functions give rise

to unphysical poles coming from the multiloop correlation function for the negative-energy eld

 which, at the present time, are not well understood. so our scattering amplitudes are only

trustworthy when these -functions of  do not contribute, i.e. when the integrands of the

scattering amplitudes are independent of the locations of the picture-changing operators and

there are no unphysical poles. besides tree and one-loop amplitudes, examples of such multi-loop

scattering amplitudes are the d = 4 and d = 6 topological scattering amplitudes discussed in

[18] and [4].

16

vertex operators replaced by r eg
(2.8) where all of the vertex operators are of the form r g

where z = {q, 0} is the picture-raising operator and we are assuming that (b)1+ =
0b1+, i.e.  has no poles with + and b has no double poles or higher with +.
it will now be shown that computing f (2g2,2g2) in (2.8) with one of the integrated

1+ is equivalent to computing f (2g3,2g2) in

1+. so if f (2g2,2g2)
computes the rns superstring amplitude when the total (left,right)-moving picture of
the vertex operators is (2g  2, 2g  2), then f (2g3,2g2) computes the rns superstring
amplitude when the total (left,right)-moving picture of the vertex operators is (2g 3, 2g
2). similarly, one can show that f (m,n) computes the scattering amplitude when the total

1g

1g

picture of the vertex operators is (m, n).

to prove the above claim (which is a special case of the claim for f (m,n) made above

(2.10)) , consider the amplitude

1+, one can pull the g+
contour o the j  until it hits the j to turn it into a g+. (we are ignoring contact

writing eg = [h g+, j ] in the vertex operator r eg
terms coming from when the g+ hits the gs.) one can now write one of the eg+s from
the cycles as eg+ = [h eg+, j], and pull the eg+ contour o until it hits the bare j  on

the vertex operator, turning it into a g. finally, one pulls the g+ o one of the cycles

1g

until it hits the j on the other cycle to give the amplitude

but up to contact terms, this is what f (2g3,2g2) computes. so we have shown (up to

contact terms) that the amplitude computed by f 2g3,2g2 is equal to the usual superstring
amplitude when the sum of the pictures of the vertex operators is (2g  3, 2g  2).

4. manifest six-dimensional spacetime-supersymmetry

to compute superstring scattering amplitudes keeping spacetime supersymmetry man-

ifest, it is convenient to perform a eld-redenition from the rns variables to green-

schwarz-like variables. at the present time, it is not possible to perform a eld-redenition

which preserves ten-dimensional super-poincare covariance; however, it is possible to pre-

serve either four-dimensional [3], six-dimensional [4], or u (5) [5] super-poincare invariance.

the four-dimensional formalism is useful for describing compactications of the superstring

on a calabi-yau three-fold; a review can be found in [3]. since we will be interested in

this paper in compactications of the superstring on a calabi-yau two-fold, we will use

the six-dimensional formalism [4] which will be reviewed in the following two sections.

after reviewing the six-dimensional supersymmetry algebra, we shall introduce a eld-

redenition which allows the supersymmetry to be made manifest. for compactications

which preserve six-dimensional supersymmetry, this eld redenition maps the rns mat-

ter and ghost variables into a set of six-dimensional superspace variables plus an n = 2

c = 2 superconformal eld theory describing the compactication. under the eld redef-

inition, the n = 2 c = 2 superconformal generators of (3.1) get mapped into a sum of

n = 2 c = 0 superconformal generators constructed from the six-dimensional superspace

variables and n = 2 c = 2 superconformal generators constructed from the compacti-

cation variables. also, the six-dimensional supersymmetry generators get mapped under

this eld-redenition into simple compactication-independent operators.

4.1. review of six-dimensional supersymmetry

our six-dimensional notation will use the fact that the rotation group so(6) is locally

isomorphic to su (4); likewise, with lorentz signature, the lorentz group so(1, 5) is locally

a real form of su (4). under the identication of the rotation group with su (4), spinors

of so(6) transform as 4s or 4s of su(4). spinors which transform as 4s will be denoted
with a raised index, a for a=1 to 4, and spinors which transform as 4s will be denoted
with a lowered index a. in this notation, vectors xm for m = 0 to 5 can be denoted as
anti-symmetric bispinors xab = (m)abxm where (m)ab and (m)ab are the so(5,1) pauli
matrices, which satisfy the algebra

(m)ab(n)ac + (n)ab(m)ac = 2mn.

also, (m)ab is dened to be (m)ab = 1

2 abcd(m)cd.

18

in n = 1 supersymmetry in six dimensions, the supersymmetry generators consist

of a pair of 4s, say q

a where  = .

(cpt invariance together with the pseudoreal

nature of the 4 representation of so(5, 1) makes it impossible to have a supersymmetric

theory with supersymmetries transforming as a single copy of the 4.) to exhibit manifest

supersymmetry, one would like a green-schwarz style description in terms of strings moving
in a superspace with coordinates xm and 

a . it is not known how to accomplish this much;
what is known is only how to introduce a single multiplet a of string coordinates, so that
half of the supersymmetries act geometrically. this is reminiscent of harmonic superspace,

but the worldsheet analog of the harmonic variables is not yet understood. the other

half of the spacetime supersymmetries is realized by vertex operators that we will describe

below. all statements in this paragraph apply to open strings or to left or right-movers

of a closed string. if supersymmetric left-movers and right-movers are combined to make

a type ii string, then the amount of supersymmetry is doubled  both manifest and non-
manifest. then there are separate q

a s carried by both left and right-movers, and separate

left and right-moving s.

the n = 1 d = 6 supersymmetry algebra is

a , q
{q

b } =

where pm is the translation generator. it is useful to dene su (2) generators, r, which
rotate these susy generators as

[r, q

a ] =

(q

a + q

a ).

(4.2)

this su (2) group acts by outer automorphisms of the n = 1 supersymmetry algebra.

in the rns formalism, the spacetime-supersymmetry generators can appear in arbi-

trary semi-integer picture. to construct these generators, one rst needs to construct the
six-dimensional spinor elds, sa and sa, out of the six rns m elds. one writes

sa = e

1

2r z

(012345)

with an even number of + signs. sa is dened by the same formula but with an odd
number of + signs. the simplest picture for the susy generators is the 1/2 picture where

however, as is well known, the susy generators dened in this picture do not satisfy

(4.4)

h em is related to the translation generator ih xm by multiplication with the

although the supersymmetry algebra now closes o-shell, spacetime supersymmetry

is not yet manifest in the rns formalism since the worldsheet variables transform in

a complicated manner under commutation with the susy generators dened in (4.5). in

order to make susy manifest, one should therefore nd a eld redenition of the worldsheet

variables such that they transform in a simpler manner.

4.2. field redenition to green-schwarz-like variables

supersymmetry generates translations of the odd coordinates of superspace. so the

rst step in dening the new variables is to look for a a

because of the j rns

dependence in a, a has non-trivial opes with any rns

compactication variable rns

c

carrying non-zero u(1) charge. for this reason, it is con-

venient to redene the compactication variables to have no ope singularities with the
six-dimensional variables. to do so, we bosonize the (, ) variables as ( = ei,  = ei).

then we make a chiral u (1) rotation of the compactication variables generated by the
parameter  + i  i

where xj , xj , j, j are the compactication variables and j = 1 to 2.

not counting the compactication variables and the six xms, the original rns the-
ory contained two chiral bosons (, ) and eight fermions (m, b, c). since the a and pa
variables describe eight fermions, one still needs to dene two chiral bosons in the super-

symmetric variables to recover the original degrees of freedom. these two chiral bosons

should be dened such that they have no singular opes with the other green-schwarz-like

variables. one of these chiral bosons, , is easily dened by bosonizing the b, c ghosts as

b = ei,

c = ei.

the remaining chiral boson, , is dened by

 = 2  i  ih rns

c

,

(4.10)

(4.11)

which is the unique combination which has no singular opes with the other supersym-

metric variables. these chiral bosons satisfy the standard opes

(y)(z)   log(y  z),

(y)(z)   log(y  z).

the completeness of the new variables to the old ones (and the equivalence of the two

descriptions) can be checked by bosonization of all variables. using the conformal weights
of the rns elds, one can compute that the operator em+in has conformal weight equal
to 1
2 (n2 3n m2 + 3m). this operator has conformal weight zero when n = m. note that
typical -dependent operators in the formalism are the real exponentials en with integer
n; in this sense,  is like the  boson of the rns formalism.

for the type ii superstring, all of the above denitions can be repeated for the right-

moving sector by simply placing bars over all elds. ignoring the left and right-moving

chiral bosons, the worldsheet action for the green-schwarz-like variables is given by

s =z d2z(

where sc is the action for the compactication variables. note that sc  sc +r d2z(i+

(i + ) = 0, this redenition does not aect sc.

it is straightforward to write the rns versions of the n = 2 superconformal genera-

tors and d = 6 spacetime-supersymmetry generators in terms of the green-schwarz-like

variables dened in the previous subsection. as will be explained below, the n = 2 super-

conformal generators of (3.1) get mapped after twisting (which in this case just removes

supersymmetric variables are all free elds and by computing their conformal weights. the
mapping of g+ contains various terms which come from the dierent terms in jbrst . for

comes from the ct  bcc term, the fourth and fth terms come from the 2c + (c)
terms, and the sixth and seventh terms come from the ie(g+ rns

the generators of (4.13) can be put in a more elegant form by performing the following

(4.14)

for the rest of this paper, we will only refer to green-schwarz-like variables which have

been transformed as in (4.14), and to simplify the notation, we will not change the symbol

for these variables.

the similarity transformation of (4.14) preserves the free-eld action of (4.12) since

5. massless six-dimensional vertex operators

given the formulas in (2.8), (4.16), and (4.17), the only missing element for computing

manifestly spacetime-supersymmetric six-dimensional superstring amplitudes is explicit

expressions for the vertex operators. after giving the denition of physical closed string

vertex operators, we shall give explicit expressions for the massless vertex operators, rst

for those which are independent of the compactication elds, and then for those which

depend on the compactication elds.

5.1. denition of physical vertex operators

as discussed in (2.6), physical vertex operators + are dened for the open n = 4

topological string by the conditions

g+

0 + = eg+

0 eg+
0 + = (j0  1)+ = 0, +  + + g+

0 .

0 cohomology is trivial in this case (this is easiest to check in rns language

since the eg+
where eg+ = ), it is always possible to dene a v satisfying

0 v = j0v = 0,

0 v, g+

+ = eg+

0 eg+

v  v + g+

0  + eg+
0e.

it will be more convenient to describe the massless compactication-independent states in

terms of the u(1)-neutral vertex operator v , while it will be more convenient to describe the

massless compactication-dependent states in terms of the u(1)-charged vertex operator
+. using the relationship described above, it is straightforward to go from one type of

vertex operator to the other.

the gauge-invariance of v ,

implies that one can choose the gauge-xing conditions

v = g+

0  + eg+
0e

0 v = 0

g

0 v = eg

(5.1)

in a manner similar to the gauge-xing of b0 = 0 in the rns formalism. applying g
the equation of motion g+

0 eg
that t0v = 0 since t0 is just the conformal weight of v . similarly, since + = eg+v ,

0 to
0 v = 0 in this gauge implies that (t0)2v = 0, which implies

0 eg+

(5.2)

g

0 + = eg+ = t0+ = 0

26

as discussed in (3.5), the integrated form of the + vertex operator is given by
1+, where the two dierent choices are related by picture-changing.

for the integrated form of the v vertex operator, one has four dierent choices:

1g+

0 v,

1g+

0 v,

z eg

z g
1eg+

0 v,

z eg
1eg+

0 v,

(5.3)

but these four choices are also all related by picture-changing. the rst two and last two
choices are related for the same reason as in the + case. the rst and third choices

0 v is physical, then up to a gauge transformation v = eg+

0 + = 0. then g+

(or second and fourth choices) are related by picture-changing for the following reason: if
0  one has v = 0+
where 0 is the  zero mode and g+
0 v = q0+ = z+
is the picture-raised version of + where z = {q, } is the picture-raising operator. so
1g+
1z+ is related to the integrated
1+ by replacing + with its picture-raised z+.
it will later be convenient to choose the picture of the integrated vertex operator to be the

+ = eg+
the integrated vertex operatorr dzg
0 v =r dzg
vertex operatorr dzg
1eg+

0 v =r dzg

0 + = eg+

same as that of v , so we shall dene the integrated vertex operator for v to be the rst

choice of (5.3), i.e.

in this gauge.

r g
1+ or r eg
z g

u =z dzg

1g+

0 v.

(5.4)

physical gauge-xed vertex operators for closed n = 4 topological strings will be

dened to be operators which satisfy the conditions of open n = 4 string physical vertex
operators in terms of both the left and right-moving constraints independently. 7 so the

7 this denition is naive since, in the usual closed string eld theory, the o-shell closed string
eld is annihilated by b0  b0. furthermore, the on-shell closed string eld is annihilated by q + q,

but not necessarily by q and q independently. in practice, however, all physical vertex operators

except for those describing special zero-momentum states are killed by q and q independently.

also, one can use the q + q gauge-invariance to x b0 + b0 = 0, which then combines with the

o-shell b0  b0 = 0 constraint to imply that b0 = b0 = 0. this is just the open string gauge-xing

condition imposed on both the left and right-moving sectors.

although a eld theory action for the the open n = 4 topological string has been constructed

[19], a eld theory action for the closed n = 4 topological string has not yet been constructed. so

we cannot justify our closed string vertex operator conditions on the basis of an action principle,

but are assuming that one can choose them to be the left-right product of the open string gauge-

xed conditions of (5.1) and (5.2). it is possible that our conditions are too strong, which might

imply that we are missing some special states.

5.2. massless compactication-independent vertex operator

for the closed superstring, the massless vertex operators which are independent of the

compactication elds are most conveniently described by a u (1)-neutral vertex operator

v which must have conformal weight zero at zero momentum. the most general such

vertex operator which is independent of the compactication elds is

v =

+xm,n=

em(i+)+n(i+)vm,n(x, , )

where v(m,n) is any function of the zero modes of x, a, and 
that the physical conditions imply that v describes the n = (1, 1) d = 6 supergravity

it will now be shown

a

multiplet for the type iia superstring, and describes the n = (2, 0) d = 6 supergravity

multiplet plus an anti-self-dual tensor multiplet for the type iib superstring.

it is easy to check that t0v = 0 implies that ppvm,n = 0 and g


0 v = 0
implies that vm,n = 0 for m > 1 or n > 1. (for instance, g
0 v is the double pole in the
g  v ope, and as g = ei, it vanishes if vm,n = 0 for m > 1.) this implies that
v satises j ++

(5.10)

this implies that

elimination of double poles of eg on vm,n for m < 0 implies that vm,n = 0 for m < 0.

29

similarly, elimination of double poles of eg

with v implies that

abcdbcdv1,1 = 6ibabv1,0, abv1,0 = 0

and vm,n = 0 for n < 0.

furthermore, there is a residual gauge-invariance of v coming from the fact that the

physical conditions are preserved by the gauge transformation

this describes either the n=(1,1) supergravity multiplet for the type iia superstring, or

the n=(2,0) supergravity multiplet plus an anti-self-dual tensor multiplet for the type

iib superstring. the ns-ns elds are described by the symmetric traceless gmn, the anti-
symmetric bmn, and the dilaton . the gravitino eld is described by a

for the type iia superstring, the four ramond-ramond elds have spinor indices of oppo-

site chirality and therefore describe the eld-strengths of the four vectors in the n=(1,1)

supergravity multiplet. for the type iib superstring, the four ramond-ramond elds

have two spinor indices of the same chirality and therefore describe the eld-strengths of

four self-dual 2-forms and four scalars. the four type iib ramond-ramond self-dual 2-

forms combine with the ns-ns self-dual 2-form and the graviton to give the bosonic elds

in the n=(2,0) supergravity multiplet. the remaining four type iib ramond-ramond

scalars combine with the ns-ns dilaton and anti-self-dual 2-form to give the bosonic elds

of an anti-self-dual tensor multiplet. note that the pictures of the component elds of v1,1
coincide with their conventional (r+, r
) charge in supergravity (whose low-energy
action is invariant under su (2)r  su (2)r).

besides the mass-shell condition mm = 0, these component elds satisfy

5.3. massless compactication-dependent vertex operators

the vertex operators for the massless moduli are constructed from the chiral-chiral

n = 2 worldsheet moduli of the compactication manifold, pi , which satisfy

g+pi = g

+

pi = eg+pi = eg

jpi = jpi = pi.

+

pi = 0,

these vertex operators are most conveniently described by a u (1)-charged vertex operator
++ whose compactication-independent part must contribute zero conformal weight at

zero momentum. the most general such vertex operator is

++ =

+xm,n=

em(i+)+n(i+)i

m,n(x, , )pi .

8 in the formula below, ui is simply a notational device for writing the su(2) doublets using
a single formula. however, it appears to be related to the uis in (2.4) since su (2)outer acts in
a similar way to the su (2) of the rjk generators in (4.2). understanding this relation could be
useful for making all of the d = 6 spacetime supersymmetries manifest.

. here we have substituted xab = xm(m)ab and

we now want to make a small deformation of this free-eld action, adding the vertex
operators of a suitable self-dual rr three-form and graviton, so as to describe an ads3s3
background that is almost at. this is appropriate for describing an ads3s3 background
obtained by compactication on k3 or t4 with large values of the onebrane and vebrane
charges q1 and q5. by studying the almost at case, we will get clues about how ads3s3
should be described in general in the framework we are using here, and this will make

possible a more complete description in section 7.

we begin by describing the explicit perturbation that is needed to get from r6
to ads3  s3 in the almost at case. the symmetry group of r6 is, of course, the
six-dimensional poincare group, and the subgroup that leaves xed a point is the six-

dimensional rotation group so(6) (or so(5, 1) if we use lorentz signature). the sub-
group of the symmetry group of ads3  s3 that leaves xed a point is so(3)  so(3)
(or so(2, 1)  so(3) if we use lorentz signature), since one can make so(3) rotations
about any given point in the homogeneous, isotropic spaces ads3 and s3, but there are
not rotations that mix the two.

the reason to focus on the symmetries that x a given point is the following. no
matter how small the cosmological constant may be, ads3  s3, if one looks at it in
the large, is not a small perturbation of r6. the s3 is compact, for example, and the
deviation of ads3 from at r3 grows as one goes to innity. viewing ads3  s3 as a
perturbation of r6 is a local process; for small cosmological constant, a portion of r6

near a given point, say the origin p , can be regarded as an approximation to a portion of
ads3s3. in view of what was said in the last paragraph, the perturbation that goes from
r6 to ads3  s3 must break the so(6) group of rotations around p to so(3)  so(3).
in the at case, our notation was adapted to the local isomorphism so(6) = su (4).
the so(3) so(3) subgroup of so(6) is instead locally isomorphic to an so(4) subgroup

35

of su (4), under which the 4 and 4 of su (4) become isomorphic and transform as the 4 of

so(4). we can usefully proceed with much the same notation as before, with one crucial

dierence that in so(4) there is an invariant metric tensor ab, which can be used to raise

and lower indices.

a self-dual two-form h that preserves an so(3)  so(3) group of rotations must at

p be of the form

ih012 = h345 = 2f,

(6.1)

for some real constant f . here we identify x0, x1, x2 as ads3 coordinates, and x4, x5, x6 as
s3 coordinates. note that in euclidean signature the self-duality condition reads h = ih,
which is the reason for the i in (6.1). a wick rotation on the x0 coordinate (taking us to
lorentz signature for ads3) will make h real. 9 ads3  s3 also has broken symmetries
that do not leave p xed.
in the almost at approximation, these correspond to the
translations of r6, and invariance under them says that h012 and h345 should be constant.
we want to embed this h eld in the six-dimensional type iib supergravity multiplet

for which vertex operators were constructed in the last section. as we have seen, this mul-
tiplet contains the four rr tensor elds h . there is also an ns tensor eld. however,

we will begin by considering the case of a perturbation by an rr tensor eld, and will

extend the discussion to the ns perturbation only at the end of the present section.

the low energy supergravity in six dimensions has an so(5) r symmetry group. the
subgroup of so(5) that does not mix rr and ns worldsheet vertex operators is so(4) =
su (2)su (2), where one su (2) acts on the rst  index of h , and the other acts on the
second. the four elds h  thus transform as a vector of su (2)su (2) = so(4), so if h
is real, it can be rotated into any desired direction by an su (2) su (2) transformation.
(by h being real we mean of course that it is real if the spactime signature is taken to
be lorentzian.) if we denote h  as h 
, where ,  = 1, 2 label the two-dimensional
representations of the two su (2)s, then the reality condition on h is h 
h  .
so a representative example of a real eld is a eld with h ++ and h  equal and real.
hence with no essential loss of generality, we take h ++ = h  = h/2, with h as above.10

=  

9 h is also real if the signature is (3, 3), a case that is natural in group theory though not in

physics, as we will see in the next section.

10 since the su (2)  su (2) mentioned in this paragraph is not a symmetry of the string theory,
we should explain more accurately in what sense we may rotate h by su (2)  su (2). the point
is that the conformal eld theory of the compactication manifold k3 or t4 actually has (4, 4)

36

from what we have seen in section 4, the vertex operators for h  and h ++ are

where  =   i and  =   i. here f is a small parameter measuring the strength
of the perturbation. this vertex operator is just the sum of the squares of the two

spacetime susy generators dened in (4.18).

note that even after adding such an interaction term to the lagrangian, e = ei

is still a chiral eld of dimension zero, as its operator product singularity with itself (and
h ) vanishes. other combinations of  and  such as ei are no longer
hence with v rr

chiral.

to order f , the deformation to ads3  s3 is simply made by adding vh to the
lagrangian. in order f 2, we must expect additional corrections. for example, the einstein
equations read roughly rab = (h 2)ab, so the departure of ads3  s3 from atness is in
order f 2. near p , which we identify as the point x = 0, the ads3  s3 background is
described by the metric

where f is the same constant as in the three-form. the vertex operator for the order
f 2 deformation cannot be constructed just using the results of section 5; in that section,

we considered metric perturbations of at empty space obeying rab = 0, while now the
relevant equation is rab = (h 2)ab. nonetheless, it is reasonable to expect the o(f 2) terms
in the action to have the form

vg = f 2z d2(cid:20) 1

(6.3)

with the . . . terms involving -dependent couplings such as pxx. we will determine

the details of the additional couplings in section 7 using spacetime supersymmetry, but

worldsheet supersymmetry, but we viewed it as a (2, 2) theory in the at space construction in

sections 4 and 5. by rotating the choice of (2, 2) embedding in (4, 4), we rotate what we mean by
h ++ and h .

37

for now we leave them undetermined and analyze some general properties that will give us

important clues for later.

already at this level, the problems of principle of adding rr elds to the vacuum, in

the rns formalism, have been circumvented. there are no spin elds in the lagrangian

that might make computations dicult, and no ambiguity coming from the dierent pic-

tures in which an rr eld can be written, since a consistent choice of pictures has been

made. the price we pay for these simplications is that  in contrast to more familiar

worldsheet actions in the rns formalism, or the at case that we reviewed in the present

formalism in section 4  there are couplings of the matter elds x, , and p to the ghost

elds , . what saves the day is that the ghost couplings have a very simple structure.
because the lagrangian only has positive powers of e and e (a fact that reects the fact

that the vertex operators have this property, and hence will persist in higher orders), the

ghost couplings are rather like screening charges; in any given computation of spectrum

or perturbative scattering amplitudes, they can be treated as innitesimal perturbations,

and taken into account only up to some nite order.

fourth order in the elds, except that some of the back reaction terms have not yet been

determined.

6.2. sigma model with supermanifold as target

now we meet a crucial fact which substantially changes the character of the problem

from what we have seen up to this point, and leads to one of the main insights of the

present paper. in the at case, the lagrangian is linear in p and has the typical structure

second order in bosons, rst order in fermions, of most physical supersymmetric actions.

but now, in (6.6), we see that there is a pp term, and moreover that (at least perturbatively

in the elds) its coecient is everywhere nonzero. hence p and p can be integrated out to

give a lagrangian for x, , and  only (plus couplings to the ghosts , ).

solving for the equation of motion for pa and pa, one gets the action

(6.7)

now let us try to interpret this lagrangian. the spacetime supersymmetry generators,
constructed in (4.18), depend on  and , but only via positive powers of e and e. there
likewise are only positive powers of e and e in sads . hence, the part of s
ads that is
independent of  and  must be spacetime supersymmetric by itself. let us call this action

bsads.

bsads has some properties that are not obvious from its origin via a small perturbation

of the at model. first of all, there is a continuous su (2) symmetry under which a =

39

a

(a, 

) transforms as a doublet (for each xed value of the so(4) index a). to write

b

 . we furthermore note that s

the action in a manifestly su (2)-invariant way, we introduce the antisymmetric tensor
 with ab=a
ads (and all
previous actions written in this section) has a manifest symmetry under z  z,   ,
  . since   ,    is an su (2) transformation, the fact that the action has
su (2) symmetry means that this operation itself (without z  z) is a symmetry, and
hence that there is also symmetry under z  z, with no action on the elds. hence we
make a further change of notation to exhibit this symmetry, which we will call worldsheet
parity. to do so, we introduce real coordinates 1, 2, with z = 1
2 (1 + i2). with these

choices, we can write bsads in the form
f 2z d2(cid:18) 1

(6.8)

which is manifestly invariant under su (2) and also under worldsheet parity. the su (2)

symmetry is not yet so striking at this point, because the dependence on  and  is so

simple and we have not determined the . . . terms. however, we will see in section 7 that

the full sigma model action (modulo ghost couplings) does have the su (2) symmetry.

what is bsads? the kinetic energy is quadratic for all bose and fermi elds. thus,
bsads is a sigma model with a supermanifold as target space. the action, in other
words, is of the general formr d2gij ii ij , with bosonic and fermionic coordinates
parity symmetry of bsads means that there is no wess-zumino term. in this context, a
wess-zumino term would be a term of the general formr d2ijbij ii jj , with bij

i , j and metric gij on a target supermanifold m . the coordinates are in fact xmn and
a, so the bosonic and fermionic dimension of the target space is 6|8. the worldsheet

a two-form on m .

moreover, spacetime supersymmetry acts on the sigma model in the most elementary

way: by geometrical transformations of m . recall that in the at minkowski background,

the spacetime supersymmetry generators were given by

this has the following very important property: if we drop the ghosts e and e, then under

supersymmetry, , , and x just transform under spacetime supersymmetry into functions

of themselves. this means that spacetime supersymmetry acts (modulo ghost couplings)

by an automorphism of the target space m of the sigma model, and is a symmetry of the

sigma model action (again modulo ghosts) if and only if the metric of m is invariant under

that automorphism. thus, spacetime supersymmetry is just a supergroup of isometries of

m . knowledge of this fact will enable us to determine m and the sigma model action in
section 7. even if the e and e terms are included, spacetime supersymmetry still acts

by automorphisms of m , but now these are  and -dependent automorphisms.

it is also illuminating to examine, in the present almost at approximation to ads3
s3, the structure of the spacetime supersymmetry currents. recall that in at minkowski
space, the susy currents for q
za = 0), while the susy

currents for q
za = 0). is this true
after the perturbation to ads3  s3? the susy transformations of (6.9) are symmetries of

a were holomorphic (i.e. j
za = 0 and j

a were similarly anti-holomorphic, (i.e. j
za = 0 and j

the quadratic part of the bsads . (they are not symmetries of the quartic terms as we have

not determined the . . . terms; also, as we will see in the next section, there are higher order

corrections to the supersymmetry transformations. but the quadratic approximation to

the lagrangian is sucient for our present purposes.) however, as symmetries of the free

kinetic energy of x, , , these transformations are not generated by purely holomorphic or

antiholomorphic currents. using the noether method to nd the currents that generate
the symmetry (6.9) of the free action, one nds for example that j+
za no longer vanishes

41

in the almost at approximation to ads, but is equal to j+
thus a conserved supercurrent j+

2 abcd(b)xcd. there is
za = 0, but it has both (1, 0) and (0, 1) pieces.
in the at case, the rotation symmetries have this property, but the supersymmetries are
purely holomorphic or purely antiholomorphic. after deformation to ads3  s3 (with rr
background), the spacetime supersymmetries are carried by mixtures of left and right-

za + j+

za = i

movers.

6.3. structure of unbroken supersymmetries

the following further remark will help in determining the sigma model action bsads

which describes the system modulo ghost terms. though there will be corrections to (6.9)

of higher order in the elds, these formulas suce for determining which supersymmetries

are broken and which are unbroken in the classical vacuum of the sigma model at x = 0.
setting e and e to zero, we see from (6.9) that the unbroken supersymmetries (which
act trivially on ,  if x = 0) are precisely those with va
 = 0. in particular, in the

 = va

sigma model, half of the supersymmetries are broken and half are unbroken.

it is instructive to calculate the algebra generated by the unbroken supersymmetries.

the anticommutator of two unbroken supersymmetries, if not zero, must of course be an

unbroken bosonic symmetry. the unbroken bosonic symmetries are the so(4) rotations

around p . a straightforward computation shows that the anticommutator of two unbro-

ken supersymmetries is indeed the generator of an innitesimal rotation of the xs and

s. the unbroken supersymmetries and rotations generate a supergroup that we will call
su (2|2); its properties are described more fully in the next section. we can think of the
unbroken symmetry group h = su (2|2) as a supergroup of rotations of x, , . the
broken bosonic symmetries are the translations x = constant. similarly the broken su-
persymmetries (with va

 nonzero) are translations of , . there is a spontaneously
broken translation symmetry for every coordinate x, , , so the target space m of the

, va

sigma model is a homogeneous space for the spacetime supersymmetry. the coordinates
transform in the adjoint representation of su (2|2) (this will become more obvious in sec-
tion 7 when we describe this supergroup in detail), so the broken symmetries, that is the

translation generators of x, , , do likewise.

even though our analysis has been based on knowing the action only to very low

order in the perturbation parameter f , it is highly plausible that the identication of the

target space as a homogeneous space is general. if so, we can determine what m must
be. in fact, the spacetime supersymmetry of type iib string theory on ads3  s3  k3

42

is su (2|2)2, where g = su (2|2) is the supergroup encountered in the last paragraph.
for m to be a homogeneous space for g  g, it must be of the form (g  g)/h for
some subgroup h of g  g; to get the right dimension for m , h must be of dimension
6|8. h is in fact the supergroup generated by the unbroken supersymmetries at any given
classical vacuum, which we may as well take to be the vacuum at p . from the analysis

in the last paragraph, h is therefore isomorphic to g. moreover, to get the unbroken

supersymmetries to transform in the adjoint representation of h, h must be a diagonal
subgroup of gg. (this embedding of h = g in gg is practically unique even without
the knowledge of how the broken symmetries transform.) if h is such a diagonal subgroup,
then m = (g  g)/h is just a copy of g, with g  g acting on m = g by left and right
multiplication.

this identication of m can further be conrmed by the following simple considera-
tion. ignoring fermionic variables, the ads3  s3 manifold can be identied as the group
manifold su (1, 1)  su (2). this is the bosonic reduction of the su (2|2) manifold.12 so
on this grounds alone, the bosonic reduction of h must be the bosonic reduction of a
diagonal subgroup of g  g.

what about the terms in s

ads with ghosts? they cannot be written in a manifestly
g g-invariant way, but must be g g-invariant anyway, with a suitable action of g g.
we postpone the analysis of how this comes about to section 8.

6.4. ns perturbation and wess-zumino term

we will see in the next section that, considering only operators with two derivatives,
the sigma model with target space g can be generalized to include one more g  g-
invariant interaction, namely a wess-zumino term. in fact, usually, in a sigma model with

target space a group manifold, conformal invariance can be achieved only if such a term is

present with the right coecient. in the next section, we will see that the sigma model with
su (2|2) target has an exceptional property: it is conformally invariant for any value of the
wess-zumino coecient (including zero). thus, omitting the wess-zumino term, we get a
conformal eld theory description of the ads3  s3 model with rr background. but the
wess-zumino term should also have a physical interpretation (as it admits a deformation

of the n = 4 symmetry of the at model described in section 4).

12 to be more precise, it is the bosonic reduction of the alternative real form su (1, 1|2) of

su (2|2).

43

in fact, its interpretation is rather simple. so far in this section, we have focused on
giving an expectation value to the rr three-form elds on ads3s3. one can also turn on
an ns three form eld, with the same ansatz (6.1). (in the interpretation of the model in
terms of strings on r6  k3 or r6  t4, this corresponds to having ns as well as dirichlet
vebranes wrapped on k3 or t4.) to rst order in f , this perturbation is made by adding

a vertex operator v ns

h of the n s b-eld. as shown in section 5, that vertex operator
contains no ghost couplings, so if one perturbs the at model by the ns three-form only,

matter and ghosts are decoupled as in the at case, while any generic combination of the

rr and ns elds gives matter-ghost couplings.

in fact, any generic linear combination of rr and ns perturbations leads to the general

structure we have found: the action contains a term pp (which appears in the rr vertex

operator) as a result of which p and p can be integrated out, to give a second order sigma
model action for the group su (2|2). the ns perturbation appears as a wess-zumino
term in this action. we will describe the spacetime supersymmetric wess-zumino term in

section 7 and see its relation to v ns
h .

if instead of a generic combination of rr and ns elds, one makes the ns perturbation

only, then one has two options:

(1) there is no pp term in the action, so it is natural to use a description with rst

order kinetic energy for fermions. this description will be given in section 10 and turns

out to be rather simple because the fermions can be treated as free elds.

h + v rr

perturbation by v ns

(2) on the other hand, one can regard the ns model as a model obtained with a
h , in the limit as   0. for every nonzero , there is a pp
term, making it possible to integrate out p. moreover, after rescaling the s by a factor
of 1/2, the resulting lagrangian has a limit as   0. this gives a dierent description
of the ns model, as a wzw model of su (2|2).

it will be shown in section 10 that these two descriptions are equivalent by rewriting
the currents of wzw su (2|2) model in terms of free fermions and an additional bosonic
wzw model on su (2)  sl(2). whether one follows route (1) or route (2), the model
with the ns perturbation only has left and right-moving su (2|2) current algebra, while
any model that includes also (or only) an rr perturbation has spacetime supersymmetries

that are carried by a mixture of left-movers and right-movers.

44

7. sigma model of su (2|2)

7.1. construction of the model

in this section, we will investigate the model that was suggested by the discussion

in section 6, namely the two-dimensional sigma model with target the group manifold of
g = su (2|2).13

first of all, in general the group (or rather supergroup) u (n|m) is the group of unitary
transformations of a complex vector space of dimension n|m, that is, bosonic dimension n
and fermionic dimension m. an element x of u (n|m) can be represented by a matrix

x =(cid:18) a b
c d(cid:19) ,

(7.1)

where a and d are n n and m m bosonic matrices, and b and c are n m and m n
fermionic matrices. such a matrix has a berezinian or superdeterminant, characterized
by the fact that for x, y  u (n|m), sdet xy = sdet y x and that if b = c = 0,
sdet x = det a det1 b.

the lie algebra (or to be more precise, superalgebra) of u (n|m) consists of matrices

of the form

x =(cid:18) a b
d(cid:19) ,

c

(7.2)

where a and d are bosonic and b and c are fermionic; a and d are hermitian and b and c
are hermitian conjugates. one denes the supertrace of x as str x = tr a  tr d.

there are two similar ways to relate u (n|m) to a group of dimension one less. we can
require that str x = 0 or equivalently that sdet x = 1. this gives a supergroup su (n|m).
or we can take the quotient by scalars, considering x trivial if it is a multiple of the identity

and identifying two xs that are scalar multiples of each other.

for n 6= m, the two operations are equivalent to each other locally. if x is a nonzero
multiple of the identity, its supertrace is nonzero if n 6= m, so requiring the supertrace to
be zero is equivalent at the lie algebra level to removing the constants.

for n = m, the story is dierent. one has str 1 = 0, so asking that the supertrace of

x vanishes does not remove the scalars. one can form a smaller supergroup, of dimension
two less than that of u (n|n), by requiring that str x = 0 and also working modulo the
13 aspects of sigma models on supergroup manifolds have also been recently considered inde-

pendently in [20].

45

constants. we will call this group su (n|n) (mathematically the name an1,n1 has been
used). the lie algebra of su (n|n) consists of matrices as in (7.2) with tr a = tr d = 0.
the bosonic part of su (n|n) is su (n) su (n), generated by a and d. the fermionic
generators of su (n|n)  that is, the matrices b and c  transform as n  n  n  n. at
this stage we notice a further coincidence that arises only for n = 2.
in this case, the
representations n and n are isomorphic, so the odd generators of su (2|2) consist of two
copies of nn. as a result, it turns out that the group su (2|2) has a group r = sl(2, r)
of outer automorphisms, commuting with the bosonic generators and rotating the two
fermionic copies of 2  2.14

to describe explicitly the lie algebra of su (2|2) with its outer automorphism group,
we proceed as follows. the bosonic part of su (2|2) is su (2)  su (2), which we identify
at the lie algebra level with so(4). the 2  2 of su (2)  su (2) is the vector of so(4).
so the odd or fermionic generators of su (2|2) consist of a pair of so(4) vectors; we write
them as sa , where a = 1, . . . , 4 is a vector index of so(4), and  = 1, 2 labels the two
vectors. the outer automorphism group will act on the  index. the bosonic generators
of su (2|2) transform in the adjoint or antisymmetric tensor representation of so(4); we
write them as kab, where a, b = 1, . . . , 4 and kab = kba. the lie algebra of su (2|2)
can be described by the following formulas:

[kab, kcd] = ackbd  adkbc  bckad + bdkac
[kab, sc] = acsb  bcsa
abcdk cd.
{sa, sb} =

1
2

(7.3)

here  and abcd are the antisymmetric tensors of sl(2, r) and so(4) and we shall dene
12 = 21 = 1234 = 1. the jacobi identity is readily veried; the sl(2, r) invariance is
manifest.

now we would like to describe a two-dimensional sigma model, with target space the
group manifold of g = su (2|2), which is invariant under the left and right action of g
on itself. the basic eld of the sigma model will be a eld g that takes values in g; the
model should be invariant under g  g acting by

g  agb1, with a, b  g.

(7.4)

14 after constructing the action, we will make a wick rotation to a group su (1, 1|2) that is
more directly relevant to the physics in lorentz signature. for this group, the outer automorphism

group is su (2) rather than sl(2, r). we will also consider later the case of euclidean signature.

46

by a sigma model, we mean a model with an action of the general form

s =

1

2z d2gij ii ij ,

(7.5)

where i are coordinates on the group manifold, and gij is a metric on g. the condition
for the sigma model to be left and right invariant is that the metric g should be invariant.
given such a metric, its restriction to the identity element 1  g is certainly invariant
under the subgroup of g  g that leaves the identity element xed (this is the diagonal
subgroup dened by a = b). conversely, any metric at the identity that is invariant under
the stabilizer of the identity can be transported over the whole manifold using the g  g
symmetry to give an invariant metric on the whole group manifold.

the tangent space to g at the identity is naturally isomorphic with the lie algebra

of g; the diagonal subgroup a = b acts on the tangent space by conjugation. so sigma

models of this form are classied by g-invariant inner products on the lie algebra of g.
if we denote the inner product of two elements x, y of the lie algebra as hx, yi, then the
condition of invariance is that for any x, y, z one has

h[x, y}, zi + (1)xyhy, [x, z}i = 0.

(7.6)

(here [ , } denotes the bracket in the lie superalgebra; we will henceforth write just [ , ].)
up to a scalar multiple, the most general invariant inner product on the su (2|2) lie
algebra reads

hkab, kcdi = abcd
hsa, sbi = ab,

(7.7)

with other components vanishing.

note that, unlike most familiar situations encountered in physics, this inner product
cannot conveniently be written as hx, yi = tr xy with the trace taken in some representa-
tion of g. perhaps it is important to point out that the basic 2|2-dimensional representa-
tion of su (2|2) cannot be interpreted as a representation of su (2|2) (operators that one
would try to dene as su (2|2) generators in this representation do not close on su (2|2)
but on its extension su (2|2)), so we cannot dene a quadratic form on the su (2|2) lie
algebra via a supertrace in this representation. the smallest representation of su (2|2) is
the adjoint representation.

the sigma model action for a g-valued eld g can now be introduced. up to a possible

multiplicative constant, it is

s =

1

2z d2 hg1ig, g1igi.

(7.8)

we would now like to expand this action near g = 1, and compare the expansion to the

action found from a dierent point of view in the last section. for this, we will pick an

explicit parametrization of the group manifold and compute the action in detail.

7.2. evaluation of the action

we wish to evaluate the action explicitly up to quartic order in the elds. let us rst

discuss this procedure in general, for any lie group g with generators ta and an invariant
quadratic form h , i on the lie algebra. we introduce coordinates a and parametrize an
element of the group near the identity as

g = exp(ata).

(7.9)

now we compute

g1dg = data +

dab[ta, tb] +

dabc[[ta, tb], tc] + o(4).

(7.10)

hence we have

hg1ig, g1igi = iaibhta, tbi 

1
12

iabicdh[ta, tb], [tc, td]i + o(5).
(7.11)
one can also explicitly describe the transformation of the a under the g  g symmetry.
we introduce innitesimal parameters a
r for the left and right group actions, and
l ta, r = a
abbreviate  = ata, l = a

l , b
rta. the transformation

exp()  exp(l) exp() exp(r)

(7.12)

can be expanded in powers of  to give

 = l  r +

1
2

[l + r, ] +

1
12

[[l  r, ], ] + o(3).

(7.13)

48

clearly, the unbroken symmetry, which leaves xed the classical vacuum at g = 1, is

generated by l+r, and the broken symmetry, which shifts the g = 1 vacuum, is generated
by l  r. the conserved currents generating the symmetries are

jl(l) =hl, dgg1i = hl, data

for the su (2|2) case, we further write

abcdxabk cd + asa,

(7.15)

with bosonic and fermionic coordinates xab, a. (the coecient of k cd has been written
as a multiple of abcdxab rather than xcd, since this leads to formulas that agree better

with the su (4)-invariant formulas of the at case.) in this case we can compute

(7.19)

when it is likely to cause no confusion, we use the same name k or s for an element of

the lie algebra and the corresponding conserved current or charge.

to analyze the ghost couplings in the next section, we will also need the maurer-

abtc, dene the right-invariant currents by expanding dgg1 =pa taj a. the j a are

cartan equations. for a general group g with lie algebra basis ta, obeying [ta, tb] =
f c
related to ja = hta, dgg1i by raising an index with the quadratic form h , i. since
d(dg g1) = dgg1  dgg1, the j a obey the maurer-cartan equations

dj a =

f a
bc j b  j c.

(7.20)

of course, the ja obey an equivalent equation. in the case of su (2|2), these equations
give

where here the currents can be either left or right currents.

finally, we shall meet in the next section the right-invariant two-forms


l = sa

l = 

note that 
l ; the ls transform in the spin one representation of the su (2) group
r of outer automorphisms. a small calculation using the maurer-cartan equations shows
that the ls viewed as two-forms on the group manifold are closed, d
2 abcdsa 
sb  k cd +    = 0, where fermi statistics have been used. since the second betti
number of the su (2|2) group manifold is zero, the two-forms 
l are actually exact,
l = d

l . though the ls are right-invariant, the ls cannot be chosen
to be right-invariant. the ls are thus non-trivial if viewed as elements of the lie algebra
cohomology of su (2|2) and are, in fact, related to the existence of nontrivial central
extensions of this group. but the fact that 
l for some ls, even though not
right-invariant, means that the interaction terms

l for some 

l = d

l = 1

(7.23)

that one might think of adding to a two-dimensional sigma model action (with coupling

constants d) are actually trivial. this fact will be important.

it will also be useful to note that 

l is invariant under all su (2|2)  su (2|2)
l .
the commutation relations of (7.3) together with the maurer-cartan equations of (7.21)

transformations except for the left susy transformations generated by the chargesh sa

imply that

[

abcd(k bc

7.3. the signature of spacetime

because of the abcd symbol multiplying the term quadratic in x, the action introduced
above describes motion of strings in a target space with signature    + ++. the
reason for this signature is that we started with the group su (2|2), whose bosonic part
is su (2)  su (2). going back to the description of the lie algebra in eqn. (7.2), if a and
d are generators of the two su (2)s, then our metric on the lie algebra was a multiple
of ha, ai = tr a2, hd, di = tr d2. thus one su (2) has    signature, and the other
has + + + signature. to get lorentz signature, we should replace one of the su (2)s by
su (1, 1) (which is locally isomorphic to sl(2, r)). su (1, 1)su (2) is the bosonic part of
a supergroup that we might call su (1, 1|2). since the analytic continuation from su (2)
to su (1, 1) maps the quadratic form tr a2 of signature    to a form of signature
 + +, the su (1, 1|2) model has lorentz signature  + + + ++. indeed, the manifold
ads3  s3 (with lorentz signature on ads3) can be understood as the group manifold
su (1, 1)  su (2).

with euclidean signature, ads3 is not a group manifold, so there is no real form of
su (2|2) that will give a positive signature ads3s3 model. however, at the cost of losing

51

the reality of the lagrangian, it is possible, as follows, to make an analytic continuation
to a model with euclidean signature in the target space. let x+ and x be the self-dual
and anti-self-dual parts of x. then the analytic continuation x+  ix+ (with no change
in x) maps to a section in which the bosonic part of the action is real and positive

denite. however, there is apparently no change of variables that makes the resulting

couplings to fermions real. this should not be a complete surprise. irrespective of our
formalism, the euclidean version of ads3  s3 cannot be represented with real elds. for
example, the threeform eld h that enters the ads3  s3 supergravity solution obeys a
self-duality condition which with euclidean signature contains a factor of i, which appeared

in subsection (6.1).

7.4. adding a wess-zumino term

to generalize the sigma model while preserving its symmetries  including two-

dimensional conformal invariance  the remaining option is to add a term

z bij di  dj

(7.27)

with b a two-form on the su (2|2) manifold. (we already analyzed in (7.23) some examples
of such terms that happen to be trivial.) there are in fact no su (2|2)su (2|2)-invariant
two-forms on the group manifold. however, for invariance of the interaction (7.27), it

suces that the three-form h = db should be invariant. h is of course automatically

closed. conversely, given a left and right-invariant and closed three-form h, one can

construct a new invariant interaction  the wess-zumino term  that is dened locally as

(7.27).

a three-form h on the su (2|2) manifold with the necessary properties is determined
by a third order antisymmetric function on the lie algebra. up to a scalar multiple, there

is a unique such function. it can be dened by

(x, y, z) = hx, [y, z]i.

the resulting interaction can be written most invariantly as

s =zx

d3y ijkhg1ig, [g1jg, g1kg]i.

(7.28)

(7.29)

the integration is carried out over a three-manifold x whose boundary is spacetime.

52

up to third order in the elds, the integrand is simply

ijkhi, [j, k]i = i(cid:0)ijkh, [j, k]i(cid:1) .

an integration by parts thus reduces the wess-zumino action in cubic order to an ordinary

(7.30)

(7.31)

(7.32)

integral over spacetime:

s =z d2ijh, [i, j]i.

for g = su (2|2), we get, to this order,

s =z d2ij(cid:18)ixabjxcbxac 

3
2

abcdxcdiajb(cid:19) .

but (7.32) describes the rst order deformation of at r6 by an h eld from the ns sector;

it is in fact the integrated vertex operator of section 5 for an antisymmetric ns-ns eld
with bmn = (m)ab(n)cbxac. note that this b eld satises mbmn = ppbmn = 0, so
its vertex operator can be evaluated using the methods of section 5.

the general g  g-invariant invariant action that is conformally invariant at the

classical level is

i =

s
f 2 + iks.

(7.33)

f is a constant that one might interpret as the inverse radius of ads3  s3; k determines
the level of the wess-zumino coupling.

7.5.

interpretation of parameters

in the application to string theory, ads3  s3 arises by compactication on t4 or k3
be the numbers of ns and

and qrr

with onebranes and vebranes. in general, let qns
rr vebranes, and let qns

and qrr

5

5

1

3

be the analogous onebrane numbers.

one parameter is easy to identify: k (if topologically normalized by including a con-

stant that we have omitted) simply equals qns

5

.

in fact, ns vebranes determine, in

the usual way, an ns h-eld with a topologically quantized ux. elementary strings are
electric-magnetic dual to ns vebranes, and qns
zumino interaction. (qrr

5 would similarly determine the level of a wess-zumino interac-
tion for a d-string probe, but in the present paper we are considering elementary string

determines the level of the wess-

5

actions only.)

on the other hand, f 1 is the radius of the ads3  s3 spacetime. this radius, when
it is large, can be measured by probing ads3  s3 by massless particles. the long distance

53

action for massless particles is governed by supergravity, so  when the radius is large  it

can be determined in terms of the brane charges by solving supergravity equations. in the
special cases qns
5 = 0, the solution is given in [9]. in general, the solution
of the supergravity equations gives

5 = 0 and qrr

1

f 2 =q(qns

5

)2 + 2(qrr

5

)2,

(7.34)

with  the ten-dimensional string coupling constant. when qrr
5 = 0 , this relation
becomes f 2 = |k|. this is the familiar relation between metric and h-eld on the group
manifold which determines the model to be a wzw model of su (2|2). it thus has left
and right-moving su (2|2) current algebra, and will be studied from that point of view in
section 10. in general, if the charges are real, one has 1/f 2  |k|.

supersymmetry requires that the onebrane charges (qns

, qrr

) be a multiple of the

1

1

vebrane charges (qns

5

, qrr

5

). so we can write

(qns

5

, qrr

5

) = q5(p, q),

(qns

1

, qrr

1

) = q1(p, q),

with relatively prime integers p, q and integers q1, q5. the parameter q1 does not enter
the su (2|2) sigma model, but it determines a certain relation between the string coupling
constant and the volume v of the k3 or t4.
in fact, v is determined by equating the
tensions of the strings derived from onebranes and vebranes15, via vt5q5 = t1q1. with

t1 =pp2 + q2/2, t5 =p(p/2)2 + q2/2, we get
q5 s p22 + q2

p2 + 2q2 .

q1

v =

(7.35)

v =

q1
q5

q

pp2 + (q)2

our treatment in the present paper is valid in the limit   0, with q, p, q1, and q5
xed. in this limit (assuming q 6= 0), the formula simplies to

.

(7.36)

as p, q, q1, and q5 are integers, v is not a continuous parameter for given , but with 
very small and q  1/, the possible values of v are very closely spaced. in our perturbative
treatment, v appears to be a continuous parameter. the fundamental reason for this is

that, as we are not considering d-brane probes in the present paper, but only fundamental
strings, we do not see the quantization of rr ux and hence qrr
be real-valued parameters. quantization of rr ux is  as always  a nonperturbative

and qrr

appear to

5

1

phenomenon from the point of view of weakly coupled perturbative string theory.

15 this condition is equivalent to minimizing the tension in the einstein frame of the bound

string made of wrapped vebranes and onebranes.

54

7.6. conformal field theory

the sigma model lagrangian (7.33) can be constructed for any lie group or super-
group g with invariant quadratic form h , i. generically, this lagrangian has a nonzero
beta function unless f and k are suitably related. however, we will now argue that for
su (2|2), the beta function vanishes for any f , k. this means that in this particular case,
we have a conformal eld theory description of a ramond-ramond background in string

theory.

the rst step is to look at the one-loop beta function. for any g, it is proportional

to the quadratic form on the lie algebra that is dened by

str adj xy

(7.37)

where str adj is the supertrace in the adjoint representation. for conventional simple lie

groups, one denes an invariant c2(g) by stating that (7.37) equals c2(g) times a basic
quadratic form h , i. for su (2|2), or in general su (n|n), (7.37) vanishes, and hence the
one-loop beta function is zero. this may be shown by explicit computation. since any
invariant quadratic form on the lie algebra is a multiple of h , i, it is sucient to consider
the case that

x = y =(cid:18) 1

0 1(cid:19)

0

(7.38)

equal diagonal generators of one of the su (2)s in su (2|2). under this generator,
the bosonic part of the adjoint representation has eigenvalues 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, while
so the vanishing comes from
the fermionic part has eight states of eigenvalue 1.
22 + (2)2  8  12 = 0. a more conceptual proof can be given by comparing to u (n|n).
we will omit this argument (which is similar in spirit to arguments we give below for the

all orders beta function).

we will give two arguments to show that the su (n|n) beta function vanishes to all
orders; one of the arguments shows that the beta function vanishes exactly and not just to

all orders of perturbation theory. since one of the arguments is based on showing that the
su (n|n) beta function is independent of n, we pause here to show that this beta function
is zero for su (1|1). indeed, su (1|1) has no bosonic generators at all and is an abelian
supergroup, so the su (1|1) sigma model is a free conformal eld theory.

55

we will show that the beta function of the su (n|n) sigma model vanishes by com-
paring it to properties of a u (n|n) sigma model. in u (n|n), one can dene an invariant
quadratic form by a supertrace in the n|n-dimensional fundamental representation:

hx, yi = str xy.

(7.39)

there is also an invariant but degenerate quadratic form str x  str y. the sigma model
action thus has two possible couplings

su(n|n) =z d2(cid:18) 1

2f 2 str (g1dg)2 + h(str g1dg)2(cid:19) ,

(7.40)

with constants f , h. one can also have a wess-zumino coupling, which we do not write

explicitly. its inclusion does not aect the argument.

it is useful to single out two generators of the lie algebra,

i =(cid:18) 1

0

0

1(cid:19) ,

l =(cid:18) 1

0 1(cid:19) .

0

(7.41)

let ta be a basis of generators that are orthogonal to both i and l. in the basis i, l, and
ta, the nonzero brackets of u (n|n) take the form
[l, ta] = cabtb
[ta, tb] = f c

(7.42)

abtc + dabi.

here f c

ab are the structure constants of su (n|n), and cab, dab are constants, whose details
will not concern us, that reect the fact that l generates an outer automorphism of
su (n|n) and i appears as a central extension.

because of this structure of the lie algebra, the lagrangian takes a very simple form.

we parametrize the group manifold by

g = exp(ui + vl + ata).

(7.43)

the quantities g1dg via which the lagrangian is expressed can be expanded in terms of

repeated commutators (the rst few terms are in (7.10)). l never appears on the right

hand side except in the linear term d, because it never appears on the right hand side of
the commutation relations (7.42). likewise, since all commutators [i, ] vanish, u does not
appear in g1dg except in the linear term. because of these facts, u only appears in the

56

action in a quadratic du dv term. the terms that do not involve i or l at all just give the
su (n|n) sigma model action. so we get the simple structure:
1

su(n|n) = ssu (n|n) +z d2(cid:18) 2n du dv

f 2

+ n2h(dv)2 +

(7.44)

f 2 l(v, a)(cid:19) .

because the kinetic energy is of the form du dv+dv2, there is a hu ui and a hu vi propagator,
but no hv vi propagator. the eld v is coupled to the su (n|n) elds a by couplings l,
whose details need not concern us. the important thing is that there are no such couplings

involving u.

since only v and not u appears in the interaction vertices and the hv vi propagator
vanishes, it follows that all u (n|n) feynman diagrams all of whose external lines are in
su (n|n) are the same as su (n|n) feynman diagrams. hence the beta function of the
su (n|n) theory is determined by the renormalization of the str (g1dg)2 term for u (n|n).
but here are two reasons that this renormalization vanishes:

(1) the operator o = str (g1dg)2 contains a du dv term. but the s-loop eective
action, for all s  1, is a function of only v and not u, since u nowhere appears in the
interaction vertices. so there can be no innity proportional to o. note that this argument
is not limited to perturbation theory.

(2) consider the n-dependence of the u (n|n) beta function. to probe it, we

parametrize the group by g = exp(pa ata) where now ta runs over all generators

of the lie algebra and a is a set of coordinates on the group manifold. to probe the beta
function, we look at the two point function hstr c(x) str d(y)i with c-number-wave
functions c and d taking values in the lie algebra. the general form of the two point
function allowed by u (n|n) invariance is

hstr c(x) str d(y)i = e(x  y)str cd + f (x  y)str c str d,

(7.45)

with functions e, f .16 now let us consider the n dependence of this two point function.
feynman diagrams in u (n|n) theory can be constructed using t hoofts double line
notation for elds in the adjoint representation of a unitary group or supergroup [21].

the n-dependence comes entirely from supertraces that arise from an index loop in a

16 to avoid infrared divergences in this discussion, one could, for example, add to the lagrangian
a mass term str g that is invariant under the diagonal subgroup of the u (n|n)  u (n|n) symmetry

of the sigma model. the argument uses only invariance under this diagonal subgroup.

57

feynman diagram. for u (n|m), the supertrace of the identity in the fundamental repre-
sentation equals nm, and one gets this factor for each index loop. for u (n|n), this factor
vanishes, and hence all diagrams that contain index loops vanish. hence the two point
function (7.45) is independent of n. so in particular e, which determines the su (n|n)
beta function, is nite for all n if it is nite for some n. we have already noted that the
su (1|1) theory is free and nite, so the e function in (7.45) must have no innity for
n = 1 and hence for all n. hence, the su (n|n) theory is nite for all n.

to avoid confusion, we should note that we are not claiming that in u (n|n), there is
no innite renormalization of the (str g1dg)2 term in the lagrangian. on the contrary,
for u (n|n), str adj l2 6= 0, so there is such an innity at one-loop order. (for u (n|n),
str adj xy is a multiple of str x str y, so the one-loop innity is a multiple of (str g1dg)2.)
likewise, we make no claim that the f term in the correlator is nite, only the e term
which is related to the su (n|n) beta function.

8. structure of the ghost couplings

8.1. first order treatment

in section 7, we argued that the ads3  s3 model with ramond-ramond background
can be described by a sigma model with couplings to ghost elds e and e. the simplifying

feature that makes the theory manageable is that the ghost couplings involve only positive
powers of e and e. hence, there is a consistent truncation in which they are neglected

in rst approximation. we have described this truncation in the last section in terms of a

sigma model with manifest spacetime supersymmetry. but looking back to the formulas of

section 7, it is clear that the ghost couplings do not have manifest supersymmetry. instead,

they have a much more complex structure that we will analyze here.

the ghost couplings that come directly from the vertex operators are as we saw in

equation (6.2),

s =

i

8z d2epaabcd

b

xcd,

(8.1)

with a similar term linear in e and a higher order ee term. let us analyze the structure
of s. just as in section 6, we will work up to quartic order in elds (that is, in p, , e,
and their barred counterparts) and try to guess the general structure. now, at least in
the at space case considered in section 4, pa is one of the supercurrents and abcd
xcd
is the ghost-independent part of another supercurrent. let us see if in the sigma model,

b

58

the ghost coupling has a similar current-current form. in going to the sigma model, it is
convenient to solve for pa by the equations of motion and write the above interaction as

s =

i

8z d2e

a

abcd

b

xcd.

(8.2)

here we have ignored the cubic corrections to pa = 

a

because they would give sixth order

terms in (8.2), which we are neglecting. now, though this is not immediately apparent,

(8.2) can actually be rewritten as

s = 

i

2z d2e(cid:18)

xcd)(cid:19)(cid:18)

a

aef g(

e

xf g  

e

xf g)(cid:19) .

(8.3)

we have added a variety of terms which vanish modulo fth order expressions for various
reasons. some terms are explicitly fth order in the elds. also, the e

term is



a

a

equivalent to a fth order expression, after integrating by parts and using the fact that
e = 0 and that a = 0 modulo cubic terms. a term e(x) is similarly fth order

after integration by parts.

let us recall from equation (7.18) the form, up to quadratic order in elds, of the

currents that generate the left supersymmetries of the sigma model:

sa
l = da

 

1
4

abcd(db

xcd  b

dxcd).

(8.4)

this has been written in a form that is manifestly invariant under the outer automorphism

group r = su (2). for the time being, however, it will be more useful to relax this manifest

invariance. we recall that (, ) are the upper and lower components of an r doublet. we

denote the upper and lower components of sl as e, f . we have up to second order

ea = da 
f a = d

j =

2z ef a  f a.

(8.5)

(8.6)

we have introduced real coordinates by z = 1
2 (1 + i2), and used fermi statistics to
express the coupling in terms of a wedge product of one-forms f a. where it will cause no
confusion, we also write ea, f a for the conserved charges obtained by integrating those

59

currents; they are of course the upper and lower components of the supersymmetry doublet
sa
. we write a
the left supersymmetry of the su (2|2) sigma model action

 for innitesimal parameters generating left-moving supersymmetry.

g = (a

we will also denote as kab the current generating the left action of the bosonic generators
kab of su (2|2) on g.

the ghost coupling in (8.3) is invariant under the right action of su (2|2) (the sym-
metry g  gb1) since the left supercurrents that appear there are all right-invariant. it
is also invariant under the left action of rotations (the bosonic symmetries in su (2|2)),
and under the left action of f a. however, under the left action of ea, s is not invariant.
because of the commutation relation {ea, fb} = 1
2 abcdk cd, the variation of s under a
left supersymmetry is

s =

1

2z ea

+abcdk cd  f b.

(8.9)

now, recall from section 7 the maurer-cartan equation for the right-invariant one-

forms on the su (2|2) manifold:

dfa = 

and

dea = 
using the formula for dfa, we can write

abcdk bc  f d,

abcdk bc  ed.

s = z e  +adf a.

(8.10)

(8.11)

(8.12)

the only hope of canceling this variation is to add ghost-dependent terms to the

symmetry transformation (8.8). a clue comes from the at case, where the supercharges
2 abcdbxcd). this suggests that
have ghost dependent terms: q
in the at case, to take the ghosts into account, the left supercurrents must be subjected

a =h (epa  i

a =h pa, q+

to a -dependent rotation which mixes e and f . as will be shown below, the appropriate

60

eld-dependent rotation is (e, f )  (e + ief, f ). this is an r transformation by the
matrix

1 (cid:19) .
w =(cid:18) 1 ie

0

this strongly suggests that we should modify the transformation law (8.8) under the left

supersymmetries to be

g =(cid:0)a

+(ea + iefa) + a

fa(cid:1) g.

now in general, under g = g, the sigma model action s = r d2 1
changes by s =r d2hi, igg1i. for the transformation in (8.14), the variation is

2hg1ig, g1igi

(8.16)

s = iz d2iea

+f a

s =z d2ea

j .

because e is holomorphic, we have (i + iij j)e = 0. using this fact and integrating by
parts, we get

comparing this with (8.12), we see that to this order, the total action s + s is invariant

under the modied spacetime supersymmetry transformation (8.14).

8.2. left and right

one strange thing about this result is that we have modied the left action of su (2|2)
on itself, but not the right action. however, by a change of variables we could reverse this

result, modifying the right action but not the left action. indeed, suppose that we make

the r-transformation that is inverse to w :

w 1 =(cid:18) 1 ie
1 (cid:19) .

0

(8.17)

this transforms the modied supersymmetries of (8.14) into the standard ones  showing

in particular that the modied supersymmetries do possess the standard commutation

relations. however, since there is only one r symmetry group that acts on all degrees of

freedom including the left and right supersymmetries, this transformation will turn the

right action of supersymmetry into

g = g(a

+(ea  ief a) + a

f a).

(8.18)

61

thus, we can put the left action or the right action of su (2|2) in the standard form, but
not both.

the left currents in s are dictated by the exotic action of the left supersymmetries
in (8.18). the similarity transformation that straightens out the left supersymmetries
and makes the right supersymmetries exotic will therefore replace the left currents in s
by right currents.

this situation is quite unfamiliar. the model possesses gg symmetry. one can pick
variables to make the action of either copy of g standard. but one cannot simultaneously

put the action of both copies of g in a standard form.

we will show explicitly how to change variables so that the ghost couplings are written

in terms of right currents rather than left currents. under the r-transformation of (8.17),

the sigma model action of (8.7) transforms to

s = iz d2(ie)r22

i

(8.19)

is the conserved current associated to the r-transformation. instead of com-

i

directly using the noether method, we shall compute it indirectly from its

commutation relations with the su (2|2) charges. ifh r is the r-charge, then the only

non-zero commutation relations are with the left and right susy charges which gives

using (7.25) and (7.26), one sees that h r has the same commutation relations as
2h (

since any two-form which commutes with all the su (2|2)su (2|2) transformations must

incorporation of e

having understood the basic structure, it is now not so dicult to give a full descrip-

tion of the ghost couplings.

first, consider the term linear in e (with no copies of e). by manipulations quite

similar to what we have seen, this coupling can be put in the form

s = 

1

2z d2eea  ea.

(8.23)

its variation, furthermore, can be canceled by modifying (8.14) so that the left supersym-

metry transformations are

g =(cid:16)a

+(ea + iefa) + a

(fa  ieea)(cid:17) g.

(8.24)

of course, just as in the discussion of s, we could make an r-symmetry transformation to
remove this correction to the left supersymmetry transformations, at the cost of adding a
similar correction to the right supersymmetry transformations. s would then be expressed
in terms of right currents.

the action s + s + s is invariant under the transformation (8.24), up to terms
of order ee. to cancel those terms, it is necessary to add to the action further terms
proportional to ee. this should come as no surprise, because as we saw in section 6, the
vertex operator for the leading order deformation from at space to ads3  s3 contains
a term proportional to ee. as we will see presently, there actually are further terms
enem with all positive integers n, m satisfying |n  m|  1. luckily, with the experience
we have gained so far, it is possible to guess the general structure.

8.4. exact non-linear ghost couplings

up to this order in e and e, the action

s = s0 +

1

2z ef a  f a 

1

2z eea  ea

(8.25)

is invariant under the ghost-modied left supersymmetries of (8.24), where s0 is the
su (2|2) sigma model action of (8.7). we will now generalize (8.25) and (8.24) in a
manner that leaves the action invariant to all orders in e and e.

the generalization of the ghost-modied left supersymmetries will be dened by

g =(cid:0)a

i vi

63

 sa(cid:1)g,

(8.26)

i are constant anticommuting parameters, vi

where a
 is a rotation matrix that depends on
e and e in a fashion which will be determined, and we recall that sa = (ea, f a) is the
doublet of supersymmetry generators. to lowest order in e and e, the matrix elements

of v are given by

v+
1 = 1,

v+
2 = ie,

v
1 = ie,

v
2 = 1,

(8.27)

where to avoid confusing the dierent types of index we let  take the values 1, 2 and
i takes the values +, . under the transformation of (8.26), the sigma model action s0
transforms as

(8.28)

s0 =z d2a

i (saivi

.)

so one would like to construct a generalization of (8.25) such that the transformation

of the -dependent terms in the action cancels (8.28). this generalization can be found

by considering the action s = s0 + s1 where s0 is the sigma model action of (8.7) and

s1 =z x,=1,2

c sa  sa.

(8.29)

here c = c; the cs are functions of e and e that will be determined. we recall also
that sa denotes either the supersymmetry generators or the corresponding left currents,

which are dened as

note that the constant -independent parts of cab can be chosen arbitrarily since, as

hsa, dg g1i.

(8.30)

shown in section 7,

z sa  sa = 0.

ignoring this constant part, the lowest order e contributions were computed earlier to be
c11 = e, c22 = e and c12 = 0.

under the modied left susy transformation of (8.26), the currents transform as

sa = a

i dvi 

1
2

abcdi bkcdvi.

(8.31)

this formula is obtained directly from the denition (8.30) of the supercurrents. under

g = g, the variation of the supercurrent has two terms, one proportional to a derivative

of  and one not; these give the two terms in (8.31).

64

so under (8.26), s1 transforms as

s1 = 2z c(cid:18)a
= 2z ca

i dvisa 

i vik cdsa(cid:19)
i(cid:0)dvis + vidsa(cid:1) = 2z dc a

abcdb

1
2

i visa

(8.32)

where vi = vi

. here we have used the maurer-cartan equations and integrated by

parts.

so to cancel the transformation of (8.28) for all a

i , we require the relation

ivi

 = 2ijvi

jc.

we dene a 2  2 matrix

c

 = c.

(8.33)

(8.34)

likewise, we regard vi

 as the matrix elements of a 2  2 matrix v . the equation then

reads

v 1iv = 2ijjc.
as c is traceless, the determinant of v is constant.
z = 1
2 (1 + i2), the equation for v and c becomes

(8.35)

in terms of a complex coordinate

v 1v = 2ic
v 1v = 2ic,

(8.36)

with  = z,  = z. this implies that

c =

1
2

(c + c) = 

i
4

[v 1v , v 1v ] = i[c, c].

(8.37)

so we are looking for solutions to c = i[c, c] such that, ignoring contant -
2 e, and c12 = 0 when e is small. one can solve

2 e, c22 = 1

independent terms, c11 =  1
these conditions explicitly to nd that

c =

4 e+(cid:18) i
1
 1
2 e
1  1

2 e

i (cid:19) .

(8.38)

so the exact expression for the action is s = s0 + s1 where

s1 =z (1

e+)1(

1
2

ef a  f a 

1
2

eea  ea  2iea  f a).

(8.39)

65

one can now look for a matrix v satisfying (8.36) (where c is given by (8.38))
such that (8.27) is satised when e is small. once again, one can explicitly solve these

conditions to nd that

v =

4 e+  1 + 1

4 e+

4 e+! .

(8.40)

8.5. exact ghost couplings in presence of wess-zumino term

one can also ask what happens to the ghost couplings in s1 after adding a wess-
zumino term to s0 with coupling parameter n . for this, we restore the coupling parameter
f (which we have suppressed so far in this section) and introduce also the wess-zumino

coupling k. so the action is

s =

1
f 2 (s0 + s1) + ksw z =

1
f 2 (s0 + s1 + n sw z)

(8.41)

where n = kf 2 and sw z = i
mation of s0 + n sw z under the left supersymmetry transformation of (8.26) is given
by

2r d3hdgg1, [dgg1, dgg1]i.17 in this case, the transfor-

i (ivi

sa

i + in ijivi

sa

j ).

(8.42)

s0 + n sw z =z d2a

here we have kept the denition sa = hsa, dgg1i, but with n 6= 0, the left supersym-
. dening

metry currents are actually the combinations in (8.42): esa

cab, v and c as above, and requiring that s1 cancels the transformation of (8.42), one
nds that the equation satised by c is modied to

i = sa

i + in ij sa

j

c =

i
2

(1 + n )v 1v,

c = 

i
2

(1  n )v 1v.

(8.43)

this implies that

c =

1
2

[(1  n )c + (1 + n )c] =

i
4

(n  1)(n + 1)[v 1v , v 1v ]

= i[c, c].

so the equation for c is independent of n .

the initial conditions for this equation, however, depend on n . to determine them,

we should be a bit more precise about how the derivation in section 6 generalizes in the

17 we take euclidean signature for the worldsheet and hence include a factor of i in sw z.

66

presence of both rr and ns ux. we start with the at model as presented in section

4, and then perturb the lagrangian by rr and ns vertex operators with coecients frr

and fns:

l  l + frrz vrr + fnsz vns.

(8.44)

in second order, both the rr and ns uxes give back reaction on the metric, and the

lagrangian will require a further correction

(f 2

rr + f 2

ns)z d2

1
24

abcdxaexbf xcexdf + . . . .

(8.45)

the coecient of this term determines, after some rescalings of elds, the sigma model

radius 1/f . in other words, if we let f = pf 2

ns, and rescale x and the s by a
factor of f 1, then the ghost-free part of the action gets an overall scale 1/f 2, as in section
6. since the e and e couplings arise in linear order only from frr, they are proportional
after the rescaling to frr/f times the expression at fns = 0. thus, the term in s1 linear
in e and e is multiplied by frr/f from what it is in the pure rr case. also, note that a
wess-zumino coupling comes only from vns, and hence after the rescaling, n = fns/f .

rr + f 2

the net eect is that turning on ns ux multiplies the linear contribution to c by a

factor frr/f = 1  n 2. since this factor appears with e, e only in the combinations
1  n 2e and 1  n 2e, it could be removed by adding a constant to  and , an

operation under which the equation for c is invariant. up to such a shift, the result for c

is independent of n . if we prefer not to shift  and , then the general solution for c is

c(e, e, n ) = c0(p1  n 2e,p1  n 2e),

(8.46)

where c0 is the solution found above at n = 0.

there is an important benet of not shifting  and  to eliminate the n dependence.

because of the background charge in the worldsheet lagrangian, such a shift would change

the string coupling constant by an amount that would diverge if we go to the points
n = 1. if we want to vary n keeping the string coupling constant xed, we should use
the form of the c matrix in (8.46).

equation (8.46) shows that going beyond the wzw point, that is to |n| > 1, would
change the reality properties of the solution. (for |n| < 1, c is hermitian if we consider
 the complex conjugate of , but that fails for |n| > 1.) in terms of our discussion in
section 7, this is related to the fact that the uxes are no longer real if |k| > 1/f 2.

67

to study the limit as n  1, a subtle choice of shifting  and  is useful. we

counter-rotate  and :

e  

e  

1  n 2
1  n 2

2

2

e

e.

(8.47)

factors of 2 have been included to put the resulting formulas in the nicest form. this
rescaling has no eect on the string coupling constant, since the background charge eects

cancel between  and . for n near 1, we now get

c =(cid:18)1 +

1  n 2

4

e+(cid:19)(cid:18)

i
1n 2

4

e

e i(cid:19) + o((1  n )2).

(8.48)

we have included terms of order (1  n ) since these are needed to determine the solution
for v . we now compute that to leading order near n = 1,

c = (cid:18) 0

0

e

0 (cid:19)

c =

1
2

(1  n ) (cid:18) ie+

inserting these formulas in (8.43), we nd that the limit of v for n  1 is

v =(cid:18) 1

ie

0

1(cid:19)(cid:18) 1 ie
1 (cid:19) .

0

(8.49)

(8.50)

in the formalism that we have used up to this point, the right supercurrents are the

standard ones, and the left ones are rotated by v . n = 1 is in fact the wzw point, at

which the left currents are anti-holomorphic and the right currents are holomorphic. a

more natural description at the wzw point is one in which the left currents are rotated by

an anti-holomorphic factor, and the right currents by a holomorphic factor. to get to such

a description, we make an r transformation by the inverse of the second factor in v , to

go to a description in which the anti-holomorphic currents are rotated from the standard

ones by a factor

and the holomorphic currents are instead rotated by

ie

(cid:18) 1

1 (cid:19) .

ie

68

(8.51)

(8.52)

it will now be shown that this r-transformation removes the ghost couplings derived
from (8.48), so we get a pure wzw model of su (2|2), with the currents rotated as just
indicated. this description, which matches nicely with the treatment of the at case in
section 4, will be our starting point in section 10, where we examine su (2|2) current
algebra.

so we need to show that

(s0 + n sw z) + (s) = s

(8.53)

under the r-transformation of (8.52) where s = r ef a  f a. we will organize the

proof as follows. we will show that the rst order variation of s0 + n sw z  that is, the
term of order e  is

1(s0 + n sw z) = s.

(8.54)

this is the result we want to rst order in e. moreover, we will prove that there are no
higher order terms (proportional to en for n > 1) in (s0 + n sw z). combining this last
fact with (8.54), which identies s as the rst order variation of s0 + n sw z, it follows
that s = 0. hence the left hand side of (8.53) is linear in e, and (8.54) is equivalent to
(8.53).

to show (8.54), note rst that

1(s0 + n sw z) = iz d2(ie)er22

i = iz d2ezer22

z

(8.55)

i

is the conserved current of the wzw model associated to the r-transformation.

at this stage, we can prove that there can be no higher order variation of s0 + n sw z.
indeed, since two strictly upper triangular 2  2 matrices commute, the r-transformation

whereer
we are making, if the coecient e is constant, would commute with the current er22
that generates an upper triangular r transformation. a variation of er22

z
z proportional to
derivatives of e would, on symmetry and dimensional grounds, be proportional to e = 0.

so (s0 + n sw z) = 1(s0 + n sw z). as we discussed in the last paragraph, it follows
that (8.54) and (8.53) are equivalent.

this completes the proof.

8.6. quantum treatment and conformal invariance

the above analysis of the supersymmetry of the ghost couplings was really based on

a classical manipulation. one may question whether there are quantum anomalies that

spoil supersymmetry.

first of all, there is no problem in maintaining invariance under the right action of
su (2|2), since this is preserved, for example, by pauli-villars regularization. likewise,
pauli-villars regularization preserves the symmetry under the bosonic part of su (2|2),
acting on the left. the question is to preserve the left supersymmetries.

let us suppose that, in some regularization, c and v have been chosen so that the
supersymmetric variation of the action vanishes up to kth order in e and e, that is

70

including all terms ea+b with a + b  k. we also assume that c and v to this order are
polynomials of order k in e and e. we will show that c and v can be corrected by k + 1th

order polynomials to cancel the variation in that order. the analysis could be taken as a

substitute for the explicit solution of the classical equations that we have given above.

an important part of the structure is that since  and  enter only in the combinations
e and e, which have no short distance singularities,  and  can be treated in making

the analysis as c-number functions that obey  =  = 0. also, if  and  are constant,

the whole deformation that we have constructed collapses. that is because, as explained
in section 7, the two forms sa  sa can be written

sa  sa = d

for some . hence the interaction s1 is

s1 = z dc  ,

(8.60)

(8.61)

where we can think of  as a quantum eld operator of dimension one. this shows that

the corrections to the sigma model action s0 vanish if c is constant and in general are

soft or superrenormalizable interactions. we will not actually use this way of writing

s1 explicitly, because there is no nice choice of  (for instance, one cannot pick  to be

right-invariant), but nevertheless this fact underlies the arguments that follow. because

s1 = 0 if  and  are constant, it follows that any anomaly is proportional to z or z.
since  and  appear only via powers of e or e, any z term multiplies ea for some
a > 0, and any z term multiplies eb for some b > 0.

let esai = vi

sa be the rotated supercurrents that generate the left supersymmetry

to order k. thus, the divergence of esai is of order k + 1 in e, e. this divergence is of

the form

where oai has the following properties. it is right-invariant and of dimension two since

es is right-invariant and of dimension one; it is proportional to  or  since there is no

anomaly if these vanish; and because of the a index of the current, it transforms as a vector
under the rotation subgroup of su (2|2). any operator with these properties is a linear

(8.62)

iesai
i = oai ,

71

combination of the left supersymmetry currents times  or .18 the divergence of the

currents is therefore of this form, and hence so is the variation of the action s0 + s1 under

a supersymmetry generated by esai :

ai (s0 + s1) =z d2(cid:16)zfijesj

z a(cid:17) .
z a + zgijesj

(8.63)

here fij and gij are unknown functions of e and e. a wess-zumino consistency
condition19 shows that

fij = fji,

gij = gji.

(8.64)

furthermore, fij is divisible by e, since, as noted at the end of the last paragraph  only
appears in this form, so the  term in (8.63) is really a sum of terms ea with a > 0;
similarly, gij is divisible by e. since ea = (ea/a) and similarly for , we can write
fij = fij , gij = gij , where f and g like f and g are polynomials in e, e. the

anomaly is therefore

ai (s0 + s1) =z d2(cid:16)zfijesj

z a(cid:17) .
z a + zgijesj

(8.65)

now we write f = h + k, g = h  k, and of course we are interested in canceling the
term of order k + 1 (in e and e) in h and k. the contribution proportional to k can

be canceled via a k + 1th order correction to c, and the contribution proportional to h can

be canceled via a k + 1th order contribution to v.

this shows that spacetime supersymmetry is not spoiled by any quantum anomalies;

at most such anomalies modify the classical expressions for c and v.

18 any dimension one classical operator is aia, where a are the coordinates on the group
manifold and  = ada is a one-form on the group manifold. the operator in question is

right-invariant if and only if  is right-invariant; but the right-invariant one-forms are associated

precisely with the left currents.

19 one applies bj to (8.63) and uses the fact that {bj , ai }(s0 + s1) = 0 since {bj , ai }

is a generator of rotations and the action is manifestly rotation-invariant. but in evaluating

bj (s0 + s1) from the formula (8.63), the action of bj on the right and side is only via the

action of supersymmetry on the supercurrents es, bjesai  ij abcdk cd. because of the ij ,

{bj , ai }(s0 + s1) = 0 holds if and only if f and g are symmetric.

8.7. conformal invariance

the contributions s0 and s1 to the action are conformally invariant at the classical
level. now we wish to show that also the quantum theory is conformally invariant. we al-

ready know from section 7 that this is true for s0 alone; we wish to show that incorporation
of the ghost couplings does not spoil conformal invariance.

the interactions in s1 are actually sigma model elds of dimension one, multiplying
 or , as we have recalled in eqn. (8.60). the trace of the stress tensor vanishes if the

soft interactions in s1 are turned o. hence, with s1 included, this trace  which we
denote t  is a sum of terms each of which is a sigma model operator of dimension one or
zero multiplying one or two derivatives of  and  and powers of e and e. in addition, t

is invariant under left and right supersymmetry. there is no left and right-invariant sigma

model operator of dimension less than two except the identity, so t is of the form

t = zzn (e, e).

moreover, by familiar arguments, n is divisible by e and e. it follows that

(8.66)

(8.67)

t = zzen (e, e)

curvature scalar of the worldsheet. upon adding such a coupling, we achieve conformal

invariance. we do not know whether with a natural regularization such an addition to the

but a c-number trace of the stress tensor of the form in (8.67) can be canceled by adding

for some en ; we have used the fact that for any a, b > 0, zzea+b = zzea+b/ab.
to the lagrangian a ghost coupling to background curvature,r d2en (e, e)r, with r the

action is actually needed.

9. n = 2 constraints for ads3  s3

in this section, we shall rst dene the n = 2 superconformal constraints associated
with the ads3s3 with ghosts that was described in section 8. the n = 4 topological con-
straints can be easily constructed from these n = 2 constraints using the method described

in section 2. we shall then show that these n = 2 constraints commute with the ghost-
dependent su (2|2) su (2|2) transformations found in section 8. using the formalism of
sections 2-5, this implies that scattering amplitudes as well as physical state conditions are
su (2|2)  su (2|2) invariant. finally, we shall show that the n = 2 constraints are also

73

holomorphic. the proofs of su (2|2)  su (2|2) invariance and holomorphicity are not as
precise as the rest of this paper, because we treat some aspects of the su (2|2) current
operator products classically, potentially overlooking terms analogous to normal-ordering

contributions in free eld theory. we expect that a more complete treatment would be
somewhat similar to the proof of su (2|2) invariance and conformal invariance of ghost
couplings in the last section.

we have not explicitly checked that our constraints have the standard n = 2 opes,

which would be a useful thing to check. probably the only dicult ope to check would
be that g+ has no singularity with itself.

9.1. review of constraints in minkowski background

since the proof of su (2|2)  su (2|2) invariance is somewhat complicated, it will be
helpful to rst review this invariance for the at minkowski case. recall that the n = 2

superconformal constraints in a at  = 6 minkowski background are given by

holomorphicity of these constraints is clear. the only non-trivial su (2|2) su (2|2)

invariance to check is the supersymmetry corresponding to q+

which generates the transformation

(9.2)

ei = 0.

note that these transformations can be obtained by taking the contour integral of the susy
generator around the worldsheet eld. we recall that  =   i and that  and  have
canonical opes.

74

under the transformation of (9.2), it is trivial to show that j = g = 0. to show
that t = 0, note that the transformation of xab cancels the transformation of pa and the
transformation of a cancels the transformation of (  i). invariance of g+ is more
complicated and inolves cancellation between various terms. the variation of e2i in
the rst term does not contribute since (p)5 = 0. the variation of pa in the rst term
contributes

which is regularized as

ee2i+ =

(9.3)

where the contour integration of y goes around the point z. to reproduce 1

ye(y)e2i(z)+(z) = ei(z)y[(y  z)1 + (z) +

9.2. su (2|2)  su (2|2) invariance of constraints

in the ads3  s3 background with ramond-ramond coupling, we learned in the
last section that the sixteen spacetime-supersymmetry transformations are now generated
by the eight fermionic components of the left-invariant currents g1dg, and by the eight

currents

that since the -dependent part of the action is anti-symmetric in z and z, it does not
contribute to t . also note that when ea = a, f a = pa, k ab = xab, and e is set to

a = ea, s2

zero, one recovers the n = 2 constraints of (9.1) in a at minkowski background. the

anti-holomorphic n = 2 generators, [t ,g

under su (2|2) transformations acting from the right, (9.6) is clearly invariant since
it is constructed using right-invariant currents. also, under the bosonic su (2|2) trans-
formations acting from the left, (9.6) is invariant since all indices are contracted in an

so(4)-covariant manner. so one only needs to check that (9.6) is invariant under the

-dependent susy transformation generated by

a
i (vi

1ea + vi

2 f a) = a

(9.7)

76

where vi

 are dened in (9.5). under (9.7), the right-invariant currents transform as

where the transformations of sa were explained in (8.31). the compactication variables

are all inert under this transformation.

one also needs to dene how the chiral bosons,  and , transform under the susy

transformation of (9.7). since (9.7) only involves these chiral bosons in the linear combi-
nation  =   i,  + i commutes with (9.7) and is therefore invariant under the susy
transformation. however, since

((y)  i(y)) en(z)

((y)  i(y)) will not be invariant but will be dened to transform as

. other formulas below must be read likewise.

in dening the above transformation we need to justify using the free eld ope (9.9)

even after the deformation of the action by coupling in the ghost elds. we can treat the

ghost couplings as a perturbation and bring down terms from the action, and recall that
the action only involves ghost terms of the form em+k. we then consider the ope of any
eld a(y) with en(z). noting that (z) has no singularity with the elds  or  coming

from the ghost couplings in the deformed action, we conclude that the deformation will
not modify the singularity structure of the ope of a(y) with en(z), and so these are the

same as the free eld ope singularity. this justies (9.9) and the opes we now consider.

in particular we have,

em(y)+i(m+1)(y) en(z) 

n
y  z

e(m1)(y)+im(y)e(n1)(z),

(9.11)

where we have taken the single pole with one of the es in the term (e(z))n. so we shall

dene

(em+i(m+1)) = e(m1)+im 1

note that e(m1)+im may have poles with 1
normal-ordered.

, so this expression may need to be
it might be possible to explicitly compute the contributions of such

e vi

normal-ordering terms, but we have not yet done so. finally, we will need to know the susy
transformation of ei. since ei has no poles with en for n positive, we shall dene

(ei) = 0.

(9.13)

using the transformations dened above, it is now straightforward to check that the

n = 2 constraints of (9.6) are invariant under (9.7). the easiest constraints to check are
g and j, which are invariant using (9.13) and the fact that  is invariant. the next
easiest constraint to check is t , where the variation of the the sigma model term cancels

the variation of the kinetic term of the chiral bosons. note that the sigma model term
can be written as str(g g1g g1), whose variation under (9.7) is a
. the
kinetic term for the chiral bosons can be written as 1
2 (  i)( + i), so using (9.10),
its variation is a

the hardest constraint to check is g+. to check its invariance, it will be useful to

note that

cc = cc = 0.

from equation (8.35), this implies that

note that

(9.15)

(9.16)

(9.17)

where x, y and z only depend on the chiral bosons in the combinations  and  and the
last term comes from (9.3). dening the supersymmetry transformation of g+ by

g+ = (e2i)x + e2ix + (e)y + ey + (ei)z + eiz + (e2i+)e,
(9.18)
we shall now show that g+ = 0. variation of the rst term in g+ gives two contributions,
one coming from the variation of e2i and the other coming from the variation of uab.

model stress-tensor, the remainining contribution to the third term in g+ is given by

(9.24)

but by writing the fourth term in g+ as in (9.3), it is easy to see that (9.24) is cancelled
by the variation of the e2i+ in (9.3). so we have shown, up to normal ordering, that the
constraints of (9.6) are su (2|2)-invariant.

9.3. holomorphicity of constraints

it will now be shown that, in addition to being invariant under su (2|2)  su (2|2),
the n = 2 constraints of (9.6) are also holomorphic. to prove this, we will need to know

some facts about the chiral bosons. the rst fact is that  = 0. this is because the action

only involves  and  in the combination  + i, so ( + i) = 0 even after including

the -dependent terms of s1 into the action. however, once those -dependent couplings
are included,   i is no longer holomorphic. rather, in the presence of those couplings
the equation of motion for  gives (  i) = 2s1/. another useful fact is that
ei = 0. this can be seen by unbosonizing the  eld back into b = ei and c = ei.
since the -dependent part of the action only includes positive powers of e = ei,

it contains b dependence but not c dependence. so the equation of motion for c is still

b = 0. a nal useful fact is that

ei(m+1)+m = eim+(m1) i

e s


a cs
a

(9.25)

where s


a is dened to be the z component of the left-supersymmetry current s

a . note
that when there is no bar over the current, it will be assumed to be the z component of

80

the current. equation (9.25) can be heuristically justied in a manner similar to (9.12),

but there may be normal-ordering contributions that have not been included.

to prove holomorphicity of the constraints, we will also need to know what are kab
and s
a . since the bosonic su (2|2)  su (2|2) transformations are unmodied in the
presence of s1, kab is conserved on-shell, i.e. kab = k ab. the maurer-cartan
equation implies that

(9.27)

using these equations for the chiral bosons and the right-invariant currents, one is

now ready to prove the holomorphicity of the constraints. that t = 0 was proved in
section 8. also, g = j = 0 using the above facts about chiral bosons. once again,
g+ = 0 is the most dicult equation to prove, but our task will be simplied by the
knowledge that g+ is invariant under left supersymmetry. expanding g+ as in (9.17), we

shall dene

g+ = (e2i)x + e2ix + (e)y + ey + (ei)z + eiz + (e2i+)e.
(9.28)

first, note that if one takes the supersymmetry parameter to be

(9.29)

then the supersymmetric transformation law of em+i(m+1) becomes (em+i(m+1)) =

(9.31)

using the knowledge that g+ = 0, one can therefore conclude that g+ gets contri-

butions from only three sources. the rst source is from (9.30), the second source is form
(9.31), and the third source is from when the  hits a c in g+. these three sources
contribute only to the terms x, y and z in the computation of (9.28). all other

contributions cancel out using the proof of the previous subsection. it will now be shown

that the contributions from these three sources cancel each other out in x, y , and z,
implying that g+ = 0.

10. wzw on su (2|2)

it would be nice to be able to completely solve the two parameter conformal theory

we have dened above. one of the two parameters, k is quantized and so is not associated
with a marginal deformation of the theory, whereas the other parameter, 1/f 2, controls

the radius of the target and is associated with such a deformation. the experience with

conformal theories suggests that nding an exactly solvable conformal theory along a whole

line of marginal deformations is extremely rare. in fact, the only known examples involve

tori and their orbifolds. it is not clear to us whether one should expect in the case at hand
an exactly solvable theory for all 1/f 2 and xed k. however there is one point at which
this must be so and that is the wzw limit where 1/f 2 = |k|. in this limit we should get
an ane kac-moody algebra based on the supergroup su (2|2) at level k, which should
be soluble to a large extent. the su (2|2) current algebra can be written explicitly as
follows:

kab(z)kcd(0) 

kabcd

ackbd(0)  adkbc(0)  bckad(0) + bdkac(0)

we will see how this current algebra can be realized in terms of more familiar theories.20

the at model on r6 times k3 or t4 was described in section 4 in the spacetime
supersymmetric formalism using free fermions (pa, b) of spins (1, 0). from our discussion
in section 6.4, we anticipate that after deformation to ads3  s3 with only ns ux, the
model can be described by a wzw model of su (2|2) that is obtained by integrating out p,
but can also be realized by a system in which the fermions (p, ) are both retained and have

a rst order kinetic energy. we can argue more specically that in this description, p and
 are simply free elds, just as in the r6 case. in fact, in the rns approach, the ads3 s3
background with ns ux only is described [10] by an su (1, 1)su (2) current algebra with
free fermions. such a current algebra is constructed from bosonic su (1, 1)su (2) current
algebra plus free rns fermions i. the rns approach is mapped to the supersymmetric
approach by a change of variables described in detail for the r6 case in section 4. this
change of variables maps i plus ghosts to pa, b plus some ghost-like elds. going from
r6 to ads3  s3 should not really change that story; in the rns description the i are
still free, so the same change of variables can be made in the same way and gives free elds
p, . thus, we have a prediction that the current algebra of su (2|2) can be realized by
su (2) su (2) bosonic current algebra plus free fermions p,  of spins (1, 0) (with a similar
statement relating su (1, 1|2) to su (1, 1)  su (2)). in fact, this has already been shown
[23], and we will review it below.

the su (2|2) current algebra, restricted to su (2) su (2), is at levels (k, k), where
the minus sign for one of the su (2)s is familiar from section 7. since inclusion of p,  will

shift the level by +2 for each su (2), we must start with a purely bosonic current algebra
at level (k  2, k  2) for the two su (2)s:

c =

3(k  2)
(k  2) + 2

+

3(k  2)
(k  2) + 2

= 6.

(10.1)

20 it would be interesting to revisit sigma models on super calabi-yau manifolds proposed in
[22] as mirror to rigid calabi-yau manifolds, in light of the observation here that sigma model on

supermanifolds may in some cases be equivalent to more familiar systems.

84

what central charge do we expect for the su (2|2) current algebra? for any group

at level k, the central charge is

c =

kdim g
k + c2(g)

.

here c2(g) denotes the dual coxeter number of the group g, and in the case of a supergroup,
dim g is interpreted as the super-dimension of the group. for su (2|2), as we know from
section 7, c2(g) = 0, so the above formula becomes c = dim g. the superdimension of
su (2|2) is 2, so we expect c = 2. this agrees with the contribution 6 from the bosonic
current algebra plus 4(2) = 8 from four pairs of spin (1, 0) free fermions.
we will now complete the dictionary between the currents k ab and sa

 of su (2|2)
and the bosonic currents jab of su (2)  su (2) of wzw and the free fermions (pa, a).
(in writing the bosonic currents as jab, we identify the adjoint representation of su (2) 
su (2) = so(4) with the antisymmetric tensor representation of so(4).) the so(4) ope
structure of the so(4) currents together with p and  is given (for the left-movers) by21

z

pa(z)b(0) 

ab
z

pa(z)jbc(0)  0

a(z)jbc(0)  0

the su (2|2) currents can be constructed out of these elds as follows:

k ab(z) = jab(z)  (pa(z)b(z)  pb(z)a(z))

s1

a(z) = ka(z) +

abcdb(z)(jcd(z) + c(z)pd(z))

s2

a(z) = pa(z)

(10.2)

it is straightforward to check that these currents satisfy the expected wzw opes for the
ane kac-moody su (2|2) given above. as explained in (8.51) and (8.52), the left and
right spacetime-supersymmetry generators are related to s

a and s

a = s2

21 if the levels of the su (2)s were equal and opposite, the double pole in the jab  jcd operator
product would be proportional to abcd. because of the shifts (k, k)  (k + 2, k + 2), this is

not quite so and there is a term proportional to acbd  adbc.

for application to string theory, we also must describe the global n = 4 algebra,
introduced for r6 times k3 or t4 in section 4. to replace r6 by ads3  s3, we make a
relatively simple modication using the above-described elds. thus, we write the n = 4

algebra as follows:

most of these formulas are obtained from the r6 case by replacing dx by k in the obvious

way; however, the terms involving pp/2k in g+ and eg are new. these terms arise

from a multiple contraction in the current algebra. the verication of supersymmetry and

holomorphy of the constraints is analogous to the at space case reviewed at the beginning

of section 9.
