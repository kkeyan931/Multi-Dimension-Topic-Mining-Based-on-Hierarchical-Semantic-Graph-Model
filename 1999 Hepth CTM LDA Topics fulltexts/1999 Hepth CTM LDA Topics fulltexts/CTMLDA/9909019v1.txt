i discuss and extend the recent proposal of leclair and mussardo for nite temperature

correlation functions in integrable qfts. i give further justication for its validity in the

case of one point functions of conserved quantities. i also argue that the proposal is not

correct for two (and higher) point functions, and give some counterexamples to justify that

claim.

09/99

in a recent paper [1], a. leclair and g. mussardo have come up with a very interesting

suggestion to compute correlation functions in integrable quantum eld theories at nite

temperature. in a nutshell, what they propose is to identify the usual particle and hole

excitations over the thermal ground state [2], with their non trivial dressed energies and

momenta (as obtained by solving the thermodynamic bethe ansatz equations), but still

take, for the physical operators, the undressed form factors.

the proposal in [1] is quite exciting, as nite temperature correlation functions are

quantities of the highest interest (in particular for comparison with experiments). however,

it is fair to say that no real demonstration is provided in [1] except for some one point

functions, and that the formula in [1] are merely a tentalizing guess.

i will argue in this note that, while the formula proposed in [1] for one point functions

are, at least for some operators (the densities of conserved quantities), correct, the ones

for two and higher point functions generally do not hold. the reason for this is quite

simple and physical: the formula proposed in [1] does not take into account the eects

of the dressing in the form-factors. this is ne for one point functions: since the same

multiparticle states are on the left and on the right side of the correlator, there is no motion

of the thermal ground state [2] due to interactions, and the formula for bare form factors

can still be used. in contrast, for two point functions, one has to consider intermediate

states where particle or holes have been created; this leads to a displacement of the thermal

ground state, and a dressing of the form- factors, that has to be taken into account - there

is just no reason for the bare form factors to still be relevant there.

one of the diculties in assessing the validity of [1] is that very few nite temperature

correlators are known exactly in integrable theories, and that the expressions proposed in
[1], even if conceptually quite simple, are nevertheless very hard to compute explicitely 1.

however, as i will argue below, the argument presented in [1] is quite general, and holds

just as well for correlators evaluated in other thermodynamic ensembles. the case of a

chemical potential at t = 0 turns out to be particularly simple, and will allow me to put

the two point functions of [1] to a serious test, that they unfortunately fail.

let me now proceed and discuss one point functions rst. i will only consider operators

o(x) (i refer to them, a bit incorrectly, as conserved quantities) for which the quantity

o = r o(x)dx acts diagonally on multiparticle states, with one particle eigenvalues o().

1 a possibility might be to investigate the low temperature limit, and compare it with results

obtained in [3] , but i wont do this here.

1

examples of this include the energy and momentum operators, and after a very slight

modication, the trace of the stress energy tensor considered in [1]. by translational

invariance, it thus follows that

hn, . . . , 1|1, . . . , ni

=

xi=1

o(i),

l the system length.

i want now to compute the average of o at nite temperature, and in the presence

of possible other thermodynamic couplings. i will restrict for notational simplicity to a

theory with a single particle, and consider, in addition to the temperature, the presence

of a chemical potential. generalizations are quite straightforward. due to the non trivial
s matrix of the theory, the density of allowed states p (p =  + h) obeys (i set h = 1

here):

2p () = lm cosh  + 2  (),

(1)

where i dened f  g() = r f (  )g() d

is the scattering matrix.

the average of o is computed using the thermodynamic bethe ansatz method: con-

gurations are weighed with a boltzmann weight exph et sn

i where t is the tem-

perature, s the entropy,  the chemical potential, and n the number of particles, and

saddle point equations are written, leading to the tba equations. introducing the pseudo
energy  dened by h

 = e, the tba equation at temperature t ( t = 1

r ) read

() = mr cosh     ln(cid:0)1 + e+r(cid:1) ,

(2)

it can be shown with the usual argument [4] that 2p = l 
average of o follows:

r(cid:12)(cid:12)r f ixed. from this the

ho(x)i =

notice that this expression in terms of o,  and the lling fraction f is completely general.

it would hold for a system with more thermodynamic couplings, provided these couplings

involve conserved quantities. the expression (4) also generalizes easily to cases with several

types of particles.

i will now (4) compare with the formula proposed in [1]:

ho(x)i =

yi=1

f(i)hn . . . 1|o(x)1 . . . niconn,

(5)

and argue that it is the same. of course, in [1], formula (5) is written only in the case of

nite temperature. however, all arguments presented there rely on cancellations between

numerators and denominators, together with hints from the free case and the one point

function of the stress energy tensor, and these are all features which generalize to more

complicated thermodynamic averages, like the ones involving a chemical potential. in (5),

the connected form factor is obtained in principle by using the crossing formula for non

coinciding arguments, and then getting rid of all the diverging or ill dened terms as the

arguments are sent to one another.

the key point here is that the values of the connected form-factors can be understood

generally as follows (this argument is quite similar to balogs construction [5]). to start,

i need to make some remarks on the normalization of states. consider the scalar product
h|i, which, formally, is equal to 2(0), since the normalization used in the construction
of the asymptotic states is h|i = 2(  ). of course the symbol (0) does not make
much sense, and has to be regularized properly. the way to do this is to consider the
completude relation, 1 = r d
2|ih|. this relation hides the cancellation of two terms, the
meaning of which is easier to see by introducing a nite length l in the system. first, the
state |i is actually not normalized, because of the (0) term mentioned just before; the
and similarly for the associated bra.
integral should therefore involve instead the ket

|ih|i

second, allowed rapidities for a particle are not uniformly distributed; rather, they have a

density given by 2p = ml cosh , and the completude relation should involve therefore

an integral r p ()d. for the completude relation to be equivalent to the one we used so

far, which preserves the scalar product of states, we thus need to have [6]

h|i = ml cosh .

3

(6)

the argument can be generalized to the case with several rapidities. for two particles,

the bethe equations read:

2n1 =ml sinh 1 +

2n2 =ml sinh 2 +

1
i
1
i

ln s(1  2)
ln s(2  1).

from this, we deduce that

ml cosh 1 + (12)

 (12)

h2, 1|1, 2i =det (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(12)

ml cosh 2 + (12)

=m2l2 cosh 1 cosh 2 + ml(12)(cosh 1 + cosh 2).

(7)

(8)

the formula generalizes to an arbitrary number of rapidities. as could have been expected,

it coincides with the well known formula for the norm of bethe states derived by gaudin

and by korepin in the context of the xxz and other models (see [7]).

i can now get back to (4) and (5). it is clear that the rst term of the expansions

match, due to (6)

h|o(x)|i  h|o(x)|iconn = o()m cosh .

for the two particle form factor, let me dene:

h2, 1|o(x)|1, 2iconn =h2, 1|o(x)|1, 2i  h2|o(x)|2iconnh1|1i

 h1|o(x)|1iconnh2|2i.

(9)

(10)

here, the scalar products (eg h1|1i) have to be computed in the presence of the other
particle (2), something i left implicit in the notations for simplicity. from the general
arguments explained previously, h1|1i = ml cosh 1 + (12). it thus follows that

h2, 1|o(x)|1, 2iconn = m(12) [cosh 1o(2) + cosh 2o(1)] ,

(11)

again ensuring a matching between (4) and (5). a general formula for connected form-

factors follows easily by extending (10) from n = 2 to arbitrary values of n: simply subtract

from the initial form factor all the possible contractions, being careful to evaluate scalar

products of states in the presence of all other particles - they are all expressed as various

minors of the same initial determinant. the net result is simply:

hn, . . . , 1|o(x)|1, . . . , niconn = m(12)(23) . . . (n1,n) cosh 1o(n)+ permutations,
(12)

4

and clearly ensures the coincidence of (4) and (5).

i am of course not pretending that this argument is a proof of (5), but i believe it

could be suciently strenghtened, maybe along the lines of [5]. as it stands, it certainly

gives further support to (5), and to my claim that the guess of [1] should be considered

for more general thermodynamic ensembles.

i shall now argue that, unfortunately, the formula proposed in [1] for the two particle

correlator is probably not correct. rather than give general arguments, i will present

a simple counterexample, in the case where t = 0 but there is a non trivial chemical

potential.

consider indeed the free boson with hamiltonian

h =

i will add to this hamiltonian a term v

2g

(14)

where i have set z = x + iy, y the imaginary time (called t in [1]).

on the other hand, we can consider the free boson as the uv limit of the sine-gordon

theory, where the hamiltonian (13) is supplemented by an interaction term r cos dx.
provided we consider physics at a scale much smaller than the correlation length induced
by this perturbation, 1
m  2+2g, we will observe results similar to the free boson case.
equivalently, we expect to be able describe the properties of the free boson theory using

a massless scattering description [8], with purely right and left moving particles obtained

by taking the large rapidity limit of the usual solitons, antisolitons and breathers of the
theory. the parametrization of the energy i will use in that limit is e = p = e, where
i have set an arbitrary mass scale equal to unity. the correlators (14) should therefore

be obtainable using the formulas proposed in [1]. i will show that, actually, only the one

point function is obtained.

for simplicity, i restrict to the case t = 0. the eld v then leads to the creation

of a pair of fermi seas of left and right moving massless solitons: in the following, i will

5

concentrate on the right moving sector only. the average of z is directly related with
the number of solitons in the ground state

1

2hz zdxi = hni

this quantity ts exactly in the context described previously. the two particle kernel

is given by the soliton soliton s matrix, and, since we are at temperature t = 0, the

function f becomes very simple: f = 1 for particles in the sea, f = 0 otherwise. if
we consider the operator z, it couples only to right moving particles, for which the sea
is   (, a), a a fermi rapidity. the average of z follows from the appropriate
generalization of (4):

hzi = z a

(15)

expressions for the form-factors of the operator z are well known: we can, in
principle, directly compute the connected ones, and show agreement with the general

formula (12). for instance, the two particle form-factor gives

h|z|i = 2e,

(16)

in agreement with (the massless limit of) (9) for o() = 2, the value of the integral of

z for a soliton.
form-factor (11) for simple values of the coupling g.

i have checked similarly the formula for the connected four particle

i now turn to the two point function of the operator z, and show that the expression

proposed for it in [1] this time does not work. recall the proposal of [1]:

h0|o(0)|1, . . . , ni1,...,n  h0|o(0)|1  i(1  1)/2, . . . , n  i(n  1)/2i

the physical meaning of (17) is more transparent than the formula. correlations at temper-

ature t should be determined by processes involving excitations over the thermal ground

6

state, with dressed energy and momentum [2]. these excitations can be of two types,

particles or holes (the variable  in (17)). a sum as (17) is thus expected; the key proposal

of [1] is that the form factors for the physical excitations are the same as the bare ones.

in the case we consider, the situation simplies considerably. first, let me recall the

structure of the excitations [9]. it is conveniently represented in the following table:

holes : h

+(),   a
solitons : +(),   a

antisolitons : ()  (1  g)v,  arbitrary

breathers : n()  ngv,  arbitrary

(18)

the excitation energies  have non trivial expansions given in [9].

the physical processes involved in the two point function of z are of three basic
types: creation of a pair particle hole (ie take a soliton in the fermi sea and move it

outside); creation of a pair soliton (above the fermi sea) antisoliton, and creation of a

breather. the latter two processes have thresholds. since the quantities e and p have

no singularity, and the bare form-factors do not know anything about these thresholds,

it is immediately quite obvious that the proposal of [1] cannot be true: it would lead to

singularities in the fourier spectrum of the correlator, in sharp contrast with the result

expected from (14).

first, let me show that the formula is in fact right for the free case g = 1

nevertheless, it is probably reasonable to make this counter example more explicit.
2 . in that case,
things simplify for several reasons: there are no breathers, the excitation energies have
simple expressions h
2 , and only the two particle form
factor of z is non zero, h0|z|12i = 2ie1/2e2/2. the connected term in expression
(17) reads then

in the general case, i will consider the fourier transform of the two point function,
2 eixhz(x, y)z(0)iy0 = 2g ( > 0). i will also restrict to the case of

s() = r dx

7

low frequencies (that is,  smaller than any of the thresholds), where only the particle hole

processes contribute; if formula (17) fails in that case, it will be enough to show it is not

correct.

below the lowest thresholds, s(), according to formula (17), is given by a sum of

terms sn corresponding to processes with n particles and n holes. when v = 0 and we

know formula (17) is correct, each of the sns is linear in , sn = cn. in that case, there

are no thresholds, so the sn have to be supplemented by the terms corresponding to the

other processes, each of which is also proportional to . the innite sum of all these 

terms reproduces the desired behaviour s() = 2g; as checked in [10] the convergence of
this sum is in fact very quick for g not too close to 1. when v 6= 0, formula (17) predicts
correctly (this simply follows from dimensional analysis) that all the sns now have the

form sn = fn(cid:0) 

at nite v :

v (cid:1), with cn = fn(). let us now consider the limit of small frequencies

in that case, we are instead exploring the behaviour of the functions fn in

the limit of very small argument. since the contribution at frequency  is determined by
rapidities i > a of holes and 

i < a of particles such that

(19)

clearly, for small , the particles and holes have to be closer and closer to the fermi

rapidity. the two particle contribution for instance, which reads in general

 , this two particle
contribution is the only one to consider. there are two reasons for that: one is that the

that in the limit   0, the rapidities of the n particles and n holes are all compressed
towards a, and form-factors like eg ha, a|z|a, ai vanish due to the general behaviour

(21)

except when g = 1
by a nite amount, demonstrating that (17) is not correct in that case.

2 , the right hand side is o the exact result (it should be equal to 2g)

the reader might worry here that the whole argument assumes somehow absolute

convergence of the series in (17), and that maybe one would get the correct limit in (20)
by rst summing over all contributions, then letting   0. the answer to this is that i
have considered the limit (20) only to make things as clear as possible. we are of course

interested not only in this limit, but in the behaviour of s() on the whole real axis, where

we have to recover s() = 2g for (17) to be correct. as argued above, only the one

particle hole contribution has a term linear in : other terms start with higher powers in

, and it is easy to see that only a nite number of them contribute to a given order in

. the series representing s() according to (17) is thus of the form p dkk, with all

the dks nite (eqn. (21) means that d1 is not the right one; one can also check that d3 is
not the right one - that is, it does not vanish - etc). for my argument to be spoilt by a

convergence problem, one would need this series to diverge and to somewhat represent

the simple linear term 2g; besides the fact that i have found no indication of divergence

numerically (that is, convergence seems as good as in [10]), i do not think such a scenario

is likely at all.

the reader might also be surprised by the fact that (17) is right for v = 0 but not
v 6= 0. the point is once again that (17) leads to a representation of s() as a sum of
terms of the form fn(cid:0) 
v (cid:1); validity in the case v = 0 is a statement about the sum of
fn()s, while invalidity in the case v 6= 0 is a statement about the general shape of the
sum of fns at nite argument.

the physical origin of the failure of (17) is easy to trace back to the dressing eects.

in fact, in [9], another approach to compute correlators at t = 0 with a eld coupled to the

u (1) current was proposed. in this paper, it is recognized that dressed excitations must

have dressed form-factors; an expression was proposed in particular for the low energy

behaviour of the particle hole form factor, which reproduced s() correctly.

i should stress that i have not found simple counterexamples in the context originally

considered in [1], of a theory with a temperature and no chemical potential. however, i

9

believe the argument presented in [1] generalizes to any thermodynamic average, so this

counterexample at t = 0 with a chemical potential is nevertheless a good, alas negative,

test, of their result for two and higher point functions. some easy things can be said about
the t 6= 0 case however. one of them has to do with thresholds. consider for instance the
massless limit of the sine-gordon model once again, and its massless scattering description.
at t 6= 0, it is one of the striking features of the interactions that the energy necessary to
add a particle has a gap: for instance, the energy to create a one-breather in the attractive
regime is t 1  t ln 3; similarly the energy gained by destroying such a breather is larger
or equal to this number (this follows simply from the solution of the tba equations). as a

result, if we consider again the correlator of z, processes involving the one-breather have
thresholds (recall that the bare form-factors of z with an even number of one-breathers
are zero). since the form factors in the sum (17) are the bare ones, they know nothing

about these thresholds; as for the other pseudo energies, they have no singularity at the

position of these thresholds. it follows that, according to (17), the fourier transform of

the two point function of z would exhibit singularities at nite values of the frequency
. this is of course in contradiction with the simple form of this two point function ,

that follows from conformal invariance, and indicates once again that the proposal in [1]

is generally not correct.

in conclusion, i believe that the formulas of [1] for the two and higher point functions

are in general incorrect because they dont take properly into account the dressing of the

eective vacuum created by nite thermodynamic couplings. as for the one point function

of conserved quantities, the formula of [1] looks very reasonable when compared with the

result of the tba, and presumably could be rigorously proven by a more serious analysis

of connected form-factors than the one i have presented here. i am not sure about the

one point functions of non conserved quantities - the examples studied in [1] are quite

convincing, but further work is probably needed to settle the issue.
