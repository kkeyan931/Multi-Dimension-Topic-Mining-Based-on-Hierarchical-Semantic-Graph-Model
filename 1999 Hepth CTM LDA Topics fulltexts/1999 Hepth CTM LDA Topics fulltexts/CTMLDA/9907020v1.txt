abstract

we study conserved currents of any integer or half integer spin built from mass-
less scalar and spinor elds in ads3. 2-forms dual to the conserved currents in
ads3 are shown to be exact in the class of innite expansions in higher derivatives
of the matter elds with the coecients containing inverse powers of the cosmolog-
ical constant. this property has no analog in the at space and may be related to
the holography of the ads spaces. improvements to the physical currents are de-
scribed as the trivial local current cohomology class. a complex of spin s currents
(t s,d) is dened and the cohomology group h 1(t s,d) = c2s+1 is found. this
paper is an extended version of hep-th/9906149.

1 introduction

the role of anti-de sitter (ads) geometry in the high energy physics increased greatly due
to the maldacena conjecture [1] on the duality between the theory of gravity in the ads
space and conformal theory on the boundary of the ads space [2, 3]. the holography
hypothesis suggests that the two types of theories are equivalent. the same time, ads
geometry plays very important role in the theory of higher spin gauge elds (for a brief
review see [4]) because interactions of higher spin gauge elds contain negative powers of
the cosmological constant [5]. the theory of higher spin gauge elds may be considered
[4] as a candidate for a most symmetric phase of string theory.

the group manifold case of ads3 is special and interesting in many respects.

in
particular, the 2d models on the boundary of ads3 are conformal [6]. from the higher
spin perspective, a special feature of 3d models is that higher spin gauge elds are not
propagating in analogy with the usual chern-simons gravitational and yang-mills elds.
nevertheless the higher spin gauge symmetries remain nontrivial, like the gravitational
(spin 2) and inner (spin 1) symmetries. the higher spin currents can be constructed from
the matter elds of spin 0 and spin 1/2. their couplings to higher spin gauge potentials
describe interactions of the matter via higher spin gauge elds.

schematically, the equations of motion in the gauge eld sector have a form

r = j(c; w ) ,

(1.1)

where r = dw  w  w denotes all spin s  1 curvatures built from the higher spin
potential w , while c denotes the matter elds (precise denitions are given in the sect. 2).
the 2-form j(c; w ) dual to the 3d conserved current vector eld obeys the conservation
law

dj(c; w ) = 0

(1.2)

as a consequence of the equations of motion in the matter eld sector. d is the covariant
derivative of the (innite-dimensional) higher spin gauge symmetry algebra [7, 8], i.e.
r = dw , where w is an arbitrary variation of the higher spin gauge potential. to
analyze the problem perturbatively, one xes a vacuum solution w0 that solves

r0 = 0 ,

(1.3)

assuming that w = w0 + w1 while c starts from the rst-order part. when gravity is
included, as is the case in the higher spin gauge theories, w0 is dierent from zero and
describes background geometry. in the lowest nontrivial order one gets from (1.1)

r1  d0w1 = j2(c 2) ,

(1.4)

where d0 is built from w0 and j2(c 2) is the part of j(c; w0) bilinear in c. the conser-
vation law (1.2) requires

d0j2(c 2) = 0

(1.5)

on the free equations of motion of the matter elds.

a nonlinear system of equations of motion describing higher spin gauge interactions
for the spin 0 and spin 1/2 matter elds in ads3 in all orders in interactions has been

2

formulated both for massless [9] and massive [10] matter elds. an interesting property of
the proposed equations discovered in [10] is that there exists a ow generating a mapping
of the full nonlinear system to the free one. this mapping is a nonlinear eld redenition
having a form of innite power series in higher derivatives of the matter elds and is
therefore generically nonlocal. the coecients of such expansions contain inverse powers
of the cosmological constant (the higher derivative of a matter eld the more negative
power of the cosmological constant appears) and therefore do not admit a at limit. we
call such expansions in higher derivatives pseudolocal to distinguish them from nonlocal
expressions that cannot be represented by power series in higher derivatives.

comparison of the results of [10] with (1.4) implies that such a eld redenition exists

in a nontrivial model if

j2(c 2) = d0u(c 2) ,

(1.6)

where u is some pseudolocal functional of the matter elds. the cohomological interpre-
tation with d0 as de rahm dierential is straightforward because d2
0 = r0 = 0. indeed,
from (1.5) it follows that the current j2(c 2) should be closed on the free equations for
matter elds, while (1.6) implies that it is exact in the class of pseudolocal functionals.

this fact has been already demonstrated for the spin 2 current in [10] where we
have found a pseudolocal u for the stress tensor constructed from a massless scalar eld.
in this paper, we generalize this result to the currents of an arbitrary integer or half
integer spin which contain a minimal possible number of spacetime derivatives. the
analysis of the currents of an arbitrarily high spin is greatly simplied by a formalism of
generating functions developed in this paper. this formalism is based on the so-called
unfolded formulation [11] of the relativistic equations which allows us to analyze the
problem algebraically, automatically taking into account the onmassshell character of
the problem.

exact currents with local u containing at most a nite number of derivatives of the
matter elds reproduce improvements, i.e., modications of the currents which are
trivially conserved. the new result about ads space established in this paper is that the
true currents can also be treated as improvements in the class of pseudolocal expan-
sions. this sounds very suggestive in the context of the holography hypothesis since the
corresponding eld redenitions may result in nontrivial boundary terms.

the paper is designed as follows. in sect. 2 we collect some facts about the equations
of motion of the chern-simons higher spin gauge elds and the unfolded formulation of
the equations of motion for the massless spin 0 and 1/2 matter elds in ads3. in sect. 3
we propose a formalism of generating functions to describe dierential forms bilinear in
derivatives of the matter elds. then, in sect. 4 we formulate using this method the
ads on-mass-shell complex, and in sect. 5 we study its cohomology, the cohomology of
currents. in sect. 6 we discuss what happens in the at limit.

2 higher spin and matter fields in ads3
the 3d higher spin gauge elds are described [8, 9] by a spacetime 1-form w = dxw(y, |x)
depending on the spacetime coordinates x ( = 0, 1, 2), auxiliary commuting spinor vari-
ables y (indices  ,  ,  = 1, 2 are lowered and raised by the symplectic form  = ,

3

12 = 12 = 1, a = a, a = a), and the central involutive element , 2 = 1,

w(y, |x) =



xn=0

1

2in! h, (n)(x) +  h, (n)(x)i y1 . . . yn .

(2.1)

a constant parameter  is to be identied with the inverse radius of ads3.

the higher spin gauge algebra is a lie superalgebra built via (anti)commutators from

the associative algebra spanned by the elements of a form (2.1) with a product law

(f  g)(y, ) =

1

(2)2 z d2ud2v exp(iuv) f (y + u, ) g(y + v, ) ,

(2.2)

where the integration variables u and v are two-component spinors (in accordance with
(2.1) the boson-fermion parity is identied with the parity in the auxiliary variables y).
this product law yields a particular realization of the weyl algebra, [y, y] = 2i.
the eld strength is [7, 8]

r(y, |x) = dw (y, |x)  w (y, |x)  w (y, |x) ,

(2.3)

and the equations of motion for the chern-simons higher spin gauge elds with a matter
source have a form (1.1).

the role of the element  is to make the 3d higher spin superalgebra semisimple
(hs(2)  hs(2) in notation of [7]), with simple components singled out by the projectors
p = 1
2(1  ). this is similar to the ads3 isometry algebra o(2, 2)  sp(2)  sp(2). the
latter is identied with a subalgebra of hs(2)  hs(2) spanned by

l =

1
2i

yy ,

p =

1
2i

yy .

(2.4)

we therefore identify the o(2, 2) components of w (y, |x) (2.1) with the gravitational
lorentz connection 1-form (x) = dx,
(x) and the dreibein 1-form h(x) =
dxh,
(x). since ads3 algebra o(2, 2) is a proper subalgebra of the d3 higher spin
algebra it is a consistent ansatz to require the vacuum value of w (y, |x) to be non-
zero only in the spin 2 sector. then the equation r0 = 0 is equivalent to the o(2, 2)
zero-curvature conditions

d =

(2.7)

(we use the normalization convention of [11]). then, (2.6) reduces to the zero-torsion
, and (2.5) implies
condition which expresses lorentz connection ,
, where r is the riemann tensor 2-form. therefore, the
that r = 2h  h

 via dreibein h,

equations (2.5) and (2.6) describe ads3 with radius 1, i.e. ads3 geometry appears via
solution of the vacuum equation (1.3).

the massless klein-gordon and dirac equations in ads3 read

for the spin 0 boson eld c(x) and spin 1

the metric postulate

the world indices ,  are raised and lowered by the metric tensor g = h,

h,.

the unfolded formulation [11] of the equations (2.8) in the form of some covariant
constancy conditions is most convenient for the analysis of cohomology of currents. to
this end one introduces an innite set of symmetric multispinors c1...n for all n 
0.
(following to [12] we will assume total symmetrization of indices denoted by the
same letter and will use the notation c(n) = c1...n when only a number of indices is
important.) as shown in [11], the innite chain of equations

dlc(n) =

i

2 hhc(n)  2n(n  1) hc(n2)i ,

where dl is the background lorentz covariant dierential,

dlc(n) = dc(n) + n 

c(n1) ,

(2.10)

(2.11)

is equivalent to the equations (2.8) for the lowest rank components c and c along with
some constraints expressing highest multispinors via highest spacetime derivatives of c
and c according to

c(2n)(x) = (2i)n h1
c(2n+1)(x) = (2i)n h1

(2.12)

where  is a full background derivative obeying (2.9) (for multispinors c(n) =
dl
 c(n)).

following [11], let us introduce the generating function

c(y, |x) =

1
n!



xn=0

(1)[ n

2 ] c1...n(x) y1 . . . yn = 

1

2 (c) c( 1

(2.13)

where [n + a] = n, n  z and 0  a < 1, and the boson-fermion parity (c) = 0(1) for
even (odd) functions c(y). the equations (2.10) can be rewritten in the form [11],

dlc(y, ) =

i

y  yy# c(y, ) ,

(2.14)

where dl = d  y


y .

let us note that the denition (2.13) contains inverse powers of  to obtain (2.10)
from (2.14) or, equivalently, to have (2.12) with  independent coecients. eq. (2.13) is
a manifestation of the general property that the higher derivatives in the theory appear
together with the negative powers of the cosmological constant.

the elds c1...n are identied with all on-mass-shell nontrivial derivatives of the
matter elds according to (2.12). the condition that the system is onmassshell is
encoded in the fact that the multispinors c1...n are totally symmetric. this allows us
to work with c1...n instead of explicit derivatives of the matter elds.

consider now a function f [c(n)(x)] of all components of c1...n(x) at some xed
point x. f is not supposed to contain any derivatives with respect to the spacetime
coordinates x and therefore looks like a local function of matter elds. one has to be
careful however because, when the equations (2.10) hold, (2.12) is true. we will therefore
call a function f [c(n)] pseudolocal if it is an innite expansion in the eld variables
c(n)(x) and local if f is a polynomial with a nite number of nonzero terms.

in terms of the generating functions c(y, |x) this can be reformulated as follows. let
f (c|x) be some functional of the generating function c(y, |x) at some xed point of
spacetime x. according to (2.12) its spacetime locality is equivalent onmassshell to the
locality in the y space. indeed, from (2.14) it follows that the derivatives in the spinor
variables form in a certain sense a square root of the spacetime derivatives. (this is also
obvious from (2.12).)

the equation (1.4) for the d3 higher spin system reads (in the rest of the paper we

use the symbol d instead of d0)

with the background ads covariant dierential

dw1(y, |x) = j(c 2)(y, |x)

d = dl   h y


y = d  ( +  h) y


y .

(2.15)

(2.16)

that (x) and h(x) obey the equations (2.5) and (2.6) guarantees d2 = 0. thus,
our problem is to study the cohomology of d (2.16). clearly, d commutes with the euler
operator n = y 

y . its eigenvalues are identied with spin s,

n = 2(s  1) .

(2.17)

the problem therefore is to be analyzed for dierent spins independently.

conserved currents of an arbitrary integer spin in d4 minkowski spacetime were con-
sidered in [13]. for d = 2, higher spin conserved currents were constructed in [14]. also,
some currents of spin higher than 2 were recently discussed in [15].

in the case of ads3, conserved currents of any integer spin s  1 built from two

massless scalar elds c, c  or two massless spinor elds c, c 

 have a form

(2.23)

these currents are all local because any of them contains a nite number of terms (i.e.,
higher derivatives (2.12)). the same expressions remain valid in the at limit with  
 in (2.12).

3 generating functions

to analyze the cohomology problem for currents of an arbitrary spin we rst elaborate a
technique operating with the generating functions (2.13) rather than with the individual
multispinors.

a generic lorentz covariant spacetime 1-form of spin s = n/2 + 1 bilinear in two

dierent matter elds c and c  and their onmassshell nontrivial derivatives is

where a(k, l, m), b1,2(k, l, m), and e1,2,3(k, l, m) are arbitrary constants and h is the
dreibein 1-form. introducing

one can equivalently rewrite this formula as

(y, |x) = 1...n(|x) y1 . . . yn ,

(y, |x) = h

(3.3)

here r, s, and  are complex variables, u and v ( = 1, 2) are spinor variables. the

therefore (3.3) indeed describes a general lorentz covariant 1-form bilinear in the matter
elds. from these expressions we see that the formula (3.3) produces a spacetime local
expression if all the coecients fi contain a nite number of terms in (3.4)-(3.6) and
pseudolocal if some of the expansions in negative powers of  are innite.

beyond these regions, the coecients do not contribute and therefore their values can
be xed arbitrarily. in particular, the quantities r1,2, w1,2, w1,2, ... are dened modulo
arbitrary polynomials in

the formulae considered in this section make sense for an arbitrary dimension of
spinors (discarding the question of the completeness of the basis forms like h and h 
h
). for the two-component spinors there exist additional equivalence relationships due
to the fact that antisymmetrization over any three two-component spinor indices gives
zero. this is expressed by the identity

a(bc) + b(ca) + c(ab) = 0

(3.22)

valid for any three commuting two-component spinors a, b, and c. as a result, the
forms discussed so far are not all independent. the ambiguity in adding any terms which
vanish as a consequence of (3.22) can be expressed in a form of some equivalence (gauge)
transformations of the coecients in (3.3), (3.16), and (3.17). we call these equivalence
transformations fierz transformations.

to derive a functional form of a general fierz transformation it is convenient to rewrite

possible fierz transformations of the 1-form (3.23). from here one derives a form of the
fierz transformations in the representations (3.16) and (3.17),

r1,2 =  1,2 ,
w1,2 =  1,2 + 2in1,2 ,
 w1,2 =  1,2  2in1,2 ,

4 on-mass-shell current complex

in this section we study the onmass-shell action of the operator d (2.16) on the dieren-
tial forms dened in sect. 3. the advantage of the formulation of the dynamical equations
in the unfolded form (2.14) is that it expresses the (exterior) spacetime derivative of c
via some operators acting in the auxiliary spinor space. as a result, onmassshell action
of d reduces to some mapping d acting on the coecients in the formulae (3.15)-(3.18).
let us consider the example of a 0-form. using the leibnitz rule for dl and taking
into account the equations of motion (2.14) and the zero torsion condition dlh = 0
(2.6), one gets

the remarkable property of the mapping d is that it contains z, z, 

the reformulation of the problem in terms of (t,d) eectively accounts the fact that the
elds are onmassshell. we identify the cohomology of currents with the cohomology of
the operator d acting on the space t (4.11).

via n and n (3.19), thus implying the separation of variables: the dierential d leaves
invariant eigensubspaces of n and n. as a result one can consider separately functions
r1,2, w1,2, ... with equal values n and n.
in fact, this is the main reason for using
the particular representation (3.15)-(3.18). needless to say that this property greatly
simplies the study of the cohomology of currents, reducing it to the analysis of functions
of a single variable  with two integer parameters n and n. the fact of the existence of
such a separation of variables is a consequence of the form of the matter eld equations
(2.14).

as expected, the system (4.4)-(4.9) is consistent with the fierz transformations (3.25)-
(3.30). namely, any fierz transformation of the quantities r1, w1, ... leads to the fierz

5 cohomology of currents

following [13] we study the currents containing the minimal possible number of spacetime
derivatives for a given spin s. from (2.12) it is clear that this is the case if the number of
the contracted indices  in (3.1) is zero. since the number of contractions is (n + 1)
(see sect. 3) we consider 2-forms n,n

2 with n = 1. thus we set in (3.17)

r2 = r(n, n) zn z n 1 , w2 = w (n, n) zn z n 1 ,
y2 = y (n, n) zn z n 1 ,

y2 =  y (n, n) zn z n 1 ,

w2 =  w (n, n) zn z n 1 ,

v2 = v (n, n) zn z n 1

with some constant parameters r(n, n), w (n, n), ...  [s], where s = 1 1
conservation condition means that n,n

modulo terms that do not contribute to (3.18) imposes the following conditions on the
parameters in (5.1),

4nnr + (n + n  2)(nw + n w ) + 2n(n  2)y + 2n(n  2) y = 0 ,
nw  n w + 2(ny  n y ) = 0 ,

is closed as a consequence of the conditions

our problem is to investigate whether there exist the coecients r1, w1, ... such that

(5.5)

because of the identities (3.22) there is a freedom in the fierz transformations (3.25)-
(3.30) for 1,2. also one can use the ambiguity in the exact shifts of r1, w1, ... by any
1 , ... (4.2) which do not aect 2 because d2 = 0. altogether exact shifts and

fierz transformations of 1 produce the following equivalence transformations

y1 = i(n  1)1 ,
 y1 = i(n  1) 1

2 e0(z, z,  ) (4.2).

with (z, z,  ) =  i
for a given spin s we consider separately two cases: (i) with n = 1, n = 1  2s or
n = 1, n = 12s and (ii) with n < 1 and n < 1. as shown below, the case (i) corresponds
to the nontrivial physical conserved currents, whereas the case (ii) describes all possible
improvements.

let us start with the case (i) setting for deniteness n = 1. the case n = 1 can
be considered analogously. according to (3.20), y2 is the only coecient giving a non-
zero contribution to n,1
2 (y). obviously, a 2-form with n = 1 is invariant under the
transformations (3.29). the only non-trivial equation is (4.8). with y d
2 (5.1) it takes the
form

(1+ 2)




y1 = i(1+i ) y1 +i(2s1)(1i ) y1 +iy (12s, 1)

z12s z



+p ( ) , (5.12)

where p ( ) is some polynomial (3.21). as shown in appendix a, the generic solution of
(5.12) is

y1(z, z,  ) = 

i
2

y (1  2s, 1)z12s z (1  i )(1 + i )2s1 ln (1 +  2)
1  i 1! + q( ) ,

+  z12s z (1  i )(1 + i )2s1 ln  1 + i 1

(5.13)

14

where  is an arbitrary constant and q( ) is some inessential polynomial (3.21). the
logarithms are treated as power series in  1.

at any , the solution (5.13) is an innite series in  1, thus corresponding to some
pseudolocal 1-form. thus, the 2-forms s
2(y|x) constructed with the polynomials y2 at
n = 1 and with y2 at n = 1 are d-closed and cannot be represented as ds
1(y|x) with a
spacetime local s
2(y) describes a physical
conserved current of spin s. the currents (2.18)-(2.20) are reproduced via y2 (5.1) with

1(y|x). we therefore argue that the 2-form s

y (1  2s, 1) = 22s1 ()[s] .

(5.14)

the formula (5.13) solves the problem of reformulation of the physical currents as pseu-
dolocally exact 2-forms.

let us note that 1- and 2-forms (3.16), (3.17) have the following discrete symmetry

permutting c and c ,

 [c(y), c (y); y] = ()(c)(c )+1  [c (iy), c(iy); y]

(5.15)

with (y) dened with the parameters

(r, w , w , v , y , y )(z, z,  ) = (r, w ,w, v, y , y )(z, z,  ) .

(5.16)
therefore, the currents generated by y2(n = 1  2s, n = 1) and y2(n = 1, n = 1  2s) are
equivalent by the interchange c  c .
note that the solution (5.13) is not unique, containing an arbitrary parameter . since
the transformations (5.6)-(5.11) are trivial for y1 at n = 1, this one-parametric ambiguity
cannot be compensated this way. this means that we have found a pseudolocal 1-form
that is d-closed but not d-exact, i.e., the cohomology group h 1(t,d) is nontrivial. the
physical meaning of this fact is not completely clear to us. it is however in agreement
with the one-parametric ambiguity found in [10] for the spin 2 case.

let us now consider the case of n < 1, n < 1. substituting (5.1) into the system
(4.4)-(4.9) we show in appendix b that, if the conditions (5.2)-(5.4) guaranteeing that
2 is d-closed are satised, then, modulo gauge transformations (5.6)-(5.11), its generic
solution is

where (n, n) are free parameters. at n = n = 0 one should set v (0, 0) = 0 and the
solution is a pure gauge.

15

we observe that at (n, n) = 0 the 1-form n,n

1 (y) leads to a spacetime local expression
since r1, w1, and w1 (5.17)-(5.19) are linear in  1. therefore, n,n
1 (y|x)
with some local n,n
1 (y|x). thus, it is an improvement of the physical current 2-form
j(c 2) on the r.h.s. of (2.15), which can be compensated by a local eld redenition of
the (higher spin) gauge elds.

2 (y|x) = dn,n

again, the ambiguity related to the parameters (n, n) is a manifestation of a non-
trivial cohomology. we therefore conclude that h 1(t n,n,d) is one-dimensional in each
(n, n) sector. therefore for a given spin s = 1  1
2(n + n), dim h 1(t s,d) = 2s + 1, what
is of course the dimension of the spin s representation of the d3 lorentz algebra o(2, 1).
2 (y) with n = 1 are d-exact
in the class of pseudolocal expansions. the physical conserved currents are described
by 1,12s
2 (y) with n, n  0 are
locally d-exact and therefore describe various improvements.

thus we have shown that all local d-closed forms n,n

(y). the d-closed forms n,n

(y) or, equivalently, 12s,1

6 dependence on 

generic p-forms given by (3.15)-(3.18) depend on  via the expansions (2.13). such a for-
mulation with -dependent c(y) and c (y) was convenient for the study of cohomology
since it allowed us to use -independent formulae for the mapping d (4.2), (4.4)-(4.10)
and the solutions (5.13), (5.17)-(5.19). in the at limit   0 the expansion c(y) be-
comes meaningless. to investigate what happens in this case one should use generating
functions c(y) (2.13). in this variables, the solutions (5.13), (5.17)-(5.19) acquire explicit
dependence on . for example, introducing

1,2( c, c ; y) = 2 1

therefore, in terms of r, w , ... our solutions carry an inverse power of  together
with each power of  1. equivalently, every spacetime derivation carries a factor of 1.
hence, a representation of physical current 2-forms s
1(y)
as well as elements of the cohomology group h 1(t,d) become meaningless in the at
limit   0. in terms of c(y) the formulae (5.13), (5.18), (5.19) contain the combination
(1  i1 1)1 to be expanded in powers of  1. viewed as analytic functions, these
formulae have a radius of convergence equal to , so when the ads radius 1 tends to
innity, the radius of convergence shrinks to zero.

conclusion

in this paper, we construct local conserved currents of an arbitrary spin in ads3 built
from scalar and spinor elds. it is shown that they can be treated as improvements
within the class of innite power expansions in higher derivatives.
in other words, 2-
forms j dual to the physical conserved currents are shown to be exact in this class,
j = du. the 1-forms u are constructed explicitly what allows us to write down nonlocal
eld redenitions compensating matter sources in the equations of motion for the chern-
simons gauge elds of all spins. the coecients in the expansion of u in derivatives of the
matter elds contain negative powers of the cosmological constant (i.e. positive powers
of the ads radius) and therefore do not admit a at limit. the existence of u may be
related to the holography in the ads/cft correspondence since it indicates that local
current interactions in the ads space are in a certain sense trivial and can, up to some
surface terms, be compensated by a eld redenition.

let us note that our analysis with two independent matter elds c and c  in (3.1)
covers the case with matter elds belonging to nontrivial representations of the spin 1
yang-mills group in the extended systems considered in [9, 10].

to analyze the problem systematically for the currents of all spins we have proposed
the formalism of generating functions suitable for the description of dierential forms
bilinear in the massless scalar and spinor elds. it is based on the unfolded formulation
of the dynamical equations as certain covariant constancy conditions [11] and allows us
to reformulate the problem in terms of a cohomology of some dierential d acting in the
specic auxiliary spaces encoding the full information on the onmassshell matter elds.
our main result is that the local conserved (i.e. d-closed) 2-forms of currents, which
belong to a non-trivial cohomology within the class of local expansions, are d-exact
innite power series in higher derivatives).
in the class of pseudolocal expansions (i.e.
interestingly enough, we have found that the cohomology group h 1(t,d) is nontrivial,
implying nonuniqueness of the solution for u already observed in [10] for the case of spin
2. an interesting problems for the future are to nd some group theoretical interpretation
of the result that the dimension of h 1(t s,d) in a spin s sector is equal to the dimension of
spin s representation of the d3 lorentz algebra o(2, 1) and to analyze h n(t s,d) for n 6= 1.
since in [10] it has been shown that there exists a pseudolocal eld redenition reducing
the full nonlinear equations of motion to the free system we expect that h 2(t,d) = 0,
but it is interesting to analyze the problem independently. in particular, this can shed
some light on an appropriate denition of local functionals in the ads space as some

17

subspace of the class of formal pseudolocal expansions.

note added: after this paper had been accepted for publication, the interesting paper
by d. anselmi [16] appeared, which contains explicit expressions for higher spin currents
in the at spacetime of any dimension, thus generalizing some of the results of [17] and
the present paper to arbitrary dimensions (in the at background).

appendix a. solution at n = 1.

consider the following dierential equation related to (5.12) via x = i , k = 2s  1,
 = iy (n, n) z12s z, and y = y1,

(1  x2)

d

y = (1 + x) y + k(1  x) y +


x

+ p (x) ,

(a.1)

where k and  are some constants and p (x) is an arbitrary polynomial. we have to solve
(a.1) in terms of formal series (5.5). the essential part of y (x) contains negative powers
of x, i.e. y (x) is dened modulo arbitrary polynomials.

rewriting (a.1) as

(1 + x)k+1(1  x)2 d

dx h(1 + x)k(1  x)1yi =


x

+ p (x) ,

(a.2)

we solve it in the form

y = (1 + x)k(1  x)z x
= (1 + x)k(1  x)z x

+ p (t)(cid:19)
+ (1 + t)k1(1  t)2p (t)(cid:21)
with the polynomial p (t) = p (t)  t1h(1 + t)k+1(1  t)2  1i. using that

one nds that p (t) can give a nonpolynomial contribution to y only if simple poles in
(1  t) survive in the integral (a.3). equivalently one can set

p (t) = (1 + t)k(1  t)[(1  t) + (1 + t)] .

(a.5)

therefore a generic solution of (a.1) is
y (x) = (1  x)(1 + x)k [ ln x +  ln (1 + x) +  ln (1  x)] mod polynomials . (a.6)

appendix b. solution at n < 1, n < 1.

consider rst the case with n, n < 0. to solve the system (4.4)-(4.9) with rd
(5.1) it is most convenient to gauge x the quantities r1, w1, ... in the 1-form n,n
follows,

2 , w d

2 , ...
1 (y) as

v1 = y1 = y1 = 0 ,

r1 =

,

(b.1)

r


with some  -independent r. actually, at n 6= 1, n 6= 1 one can always achieve (b.1) using
the transformations (5.6)-(5.11). first, one gauges away y1 and y1 with an appropriate
choice of the parameters 1 and 1. taking the parameter ( ) in (5.9) in the form

( ) =

1

1 +  2 he( 1) + 0i ,

(b.2)

where e( 1) is some series in the inverse powers of  , and 0 is  -independent, v1 can
be gauged away by an appropriate choice of e( 1). the parameter 0 remains arbitrary
since its contribution to v1 is proportional to  what is equivalent to zero. from (5.6)
it follows that all terms in r1 can be gauged away with a choice of ( ) except for the
leading term  1. the constant r in the term r 1 in r1 can be gauge xed by using the
ambiguity in 0, since the corresponding part of ( ),

0



1 +  2 = 0



xk=0

()k (2k+1) ,

(b.3)

contains the term proportional to  1. at this stage however it is convenient to keep r
as an arbitrary parameter to be xed later. note that xing 0 completes gauge xing of
the transformations (5.6)-(5.11).

as a result, the system of equations resulting from (4.4)-(4.9) takes the form

where all the equalities are treated modulo polynomials (3.21) and the variables 2, 2,

introducing the new variables

x + = nw1 + n w1 ,

and p1( ), p2( ), and p3( ) are arbitrary polynomials.
using that any polynomial p ( ) can be rewritten as

p ( ) = a + b + (1 +  2)p( )

with some polynomial p( ), one obtains the general solution of (b.11),

using (b.1), (b.10), (b.14), (b.16), (b.18), (b.20)-(b.22), one nds the general solu-

tion of the system (b.4)-(b.9) in the form (5.17)-(5.20), where  = i1.

let us turn to the case with n = 0, n < 0 (the case with n = 0, n < 0 can be considered
analogously). according to (3.20) the only parameters giving a non-zero contribution to
n,n
1,2 (y) are w1,2, v1,2, and y1,2, so that the nontrivial equations in the system (b.4)-(b.9)
are (b.5), (b.7), and (b.8). analogously to the case considered above, one gauge xes

and obtains the solution
w1(z, z,  ) = y (n, 0)

the rest case n, n = 0 is trivial. indeed, in this case the only contributing parameters
are v (0, 0) and v1. the parameter v (0, 0) vanish by the equation (b.7), while v1 can
be gauged away by the transformation (5.9).
