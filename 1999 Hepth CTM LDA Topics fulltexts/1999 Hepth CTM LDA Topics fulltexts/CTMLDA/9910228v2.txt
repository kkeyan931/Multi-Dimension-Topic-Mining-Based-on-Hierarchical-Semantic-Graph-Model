out the phases that appear in the modular transformations of the chiral amplitudes

ansatz for the construction of the open-string descendants in which the transverse-
channel klein-bottle, annulus and mobius-strip amplitudes are numerically identical
in the proper parametrization of the world-sheet. a simple variant of the ansatz
for the z l

1 introduction

the microscopic description of bogomolny-prasad-sommereld (bps) solitons carrying
ramondramond (r-r) charge in terms of dirichlet-branes (d-branes) and orientifold-
planes (o-planes) [1] has played a crucial role in the emerging non-perturbative picture
of string theory. although many interesting vacuum congurations of the type ii super-
string and their type i descendants can be easily accounted for in terms of d-branes and
o-planes, these concepts tend to loose their clear meaning in non-trivial compactica-
tions, such as asymmetric orbifolds [2], free fermionic models [3, 4] and gepner models
[5, 6].
insisting on a geometric target-space approach, that is expected to be valid
in the large volume limit, is by far less useful than pursuing an algebraic worldsheet
approach based on the conformal eld theory (cft) description [7, 8, 9]. the construc-
tion of type i descendants of non-geometric type ii vacuum congurations may shed
some light on the necessary generalization of the above concepts.

n  z r

it is the purpose of this paper to discuss some z l
n models that, though left-right
symmetric, do not admit a clear geometric description because of the chiral nature of the
projections. still, we are able to analyze their open-string descendants in terms of two-
dimensional cfts where the strict concepts of d-branes and o-planes are abandoned.
dierently from what has been found for geometric orbifolds, we will nd the presence
of open strings belonging to twisted sectors of the orbifold group. similar kinds of
open strings have been recently found in a discussion of type i vacuum congurations
in d = 6 that involve d-branes at angles [10]. we cannot exclude the possibility that
some of the models discussed in the present paper may admit a geometric interpretation
in terms of m-theory along the lines of [11].

we will identify the possibility of introducing additional phases (known as discrete
torsion [12]) in the modular invariant combinations of characters that appear in the one-
loop torus amplitude. some brane congurations in the presence of discrete torsion have
been considered in [13]. the introduction of discrete torsion allows one to relate models
with dierent amount of supersymmetry. the resulting theories are symmetric under
the interchange of the left and right movers for any choice of the discrete torsion and are
thus good candidate parents of type i descendants. the very possibility of working in a
rational context (only a highly restricted class of lattices admit chiral automorphisms!
[14]) makes the construction of the type i descendants almost straightforward following
the approach pioneered by sagnotti [15] and then systematized in [4, 7, 16, 17].

in this paper we are able to go a step further and simplify the construction of at least
one of the possible descendants by assuming that the transverse-channel klein-bottle

(ek), annulus (ea) and mobius-strip (fm) amplitudes exactly coincide in the proper
parametrization of the worldsheet. the numerical relation ek = ea = fm automatically

enforces the tadpole conditions. with this simplifying ansatz, the only non-trivial issue
consists in reconstructing the open-string spectrum in terms of chan-paton (cp) group

1

assignments from the overall transverse-channel multiplicities.

in the transverse channel, the klein-bottle amplitude ek represents a closed-string ex-
change between crosscap-states |ci whose target-space counterparts are the loci left
invariant under the combined action of orientation reversal () and some target-space
symmetry (i). although these objects are well dened in a cft context, they do not
necessarily admit a sensible large volume limit. they share with the standard o-planes
the property of being charged with respect to the r-r elds. the cancellation of the
r-r charge owing through the compact space requires as usual the introduction of
boundary-states |bi carrying opposite r-r charges. a minimal choice is provided
by boundaries |bi with the same closed-string content as |ci, where the dierence in
the r-r charges between the two objects is compensated by a correct assignment of cp
multiplicities. we will consider this minimal ansatz, according to which, once the cp

multiplicities have been plugged into the annulus amplitude ea, the hb|bi exchange nu-
merically coincides with the hc|ci exchange even for the whole tower of massive states.
the mobius-strip amplitude hb|ci +hc|bi, when expressed in terms of hatted quan-
tities [4] as required by the reality of fm, will again coincide with the transverse annulus

and klein-bottle amplitudes, up to alternating signs at the massive levels. the con-
struction is not as restrictive as one could imagine. one may easily check that in the
case of toroidal orbifolds it encompasses most of the z2, z3 orientifold models consid-
ered in the recent literature [18]. a general list of solutions, and a rather more precise
conformal description of the models we consider, can be systematically found following
the open-descendant techniques developed in [16, 4, 17, 7]. indeed, it is explicitly shown
in appendix b that the z l
2 model provides an orientifold description of the open-
string descendant associated to the a16 permutation invariant considered in [6]. the
same is true for the z l
3 model in d = 6 indicated as a81 in [6], although we omit
here the details of a similar correspondence.

3  z r

some circumstantial evidence for the validity of our simplifying ansatz can be illustrated
in the simplest context of the so-called toroidal orientifold models [19]. these models are
obtained by quotienting the type ii superstrings by i, where i is the inversion of the
(internal) coordinates of a d-dimensional torus. they are t-dual to standard toroidal
compactications of the type i superstring in the presence of wilson lines breaking
so(32) to so(25d)2d
does not hold because crosscap states only couple to even windings while boundary states
couple to all windings. precisely after introducing the proper wilson lines [17, 1, 19]

[17]. in the absence of wilson lines the relation ek = ea = fm
the relation ek = ea = fm is enforced. all the open-string kk momenta are shifted by

one-half unit and the transverse-channel annulus only allows even windings to ow.

slightly at variant with the minimal ansatz, in the last part of the paper we construct
a non-supersymmetric r-r tadpole-free model. the prize to pay is an uncancelled
neveu-schwarzneveu-schwarz (ns-ns) tadpole.

it is amusing to observe that in the absence of discrete torsion untwisted and twisted

2

open-string states combine with one another to reconstruct multiplets of the enhanced
bulk supersymmetry. this could sound surprising since twisted open-strings are natu-
rally interpreted as strings connecting branes at angles [10], each of them breaking
one-half of the original 32 type iib supercharges. however in the present context the
two objects are properly identied by elements of the orbifold group and the distinction

between them tends to loose meaning.

the plan of the paper is as follows. in section 2 we briey review the construction of
z l
n  z r
n asymmetric orbifolds of the type iib superstring. section 3 is devoted to the
explicit construction of the z l
2 orbifold in d = 6 in the presence of discrete torsion
and to the analysis of its type i descendants. we partly associate the rank reduction of
the cp group to the presence of a quantized ns-ns antisymmetric tensor background
[17, 20] and partly to the identication of would-be d5- and d9-branes imposed after
3  z r
quotienting by t-duality. in sections 4 and 5 we perform similar analyses for z l
3
orbifolds in d = 4, 6 and discuss their type i descendants. in section 6 we describe a
variant of the z l
2 model in d = 6 that leads to brane supersymmetry breaking
[22, 21, 23, 24]. finally, section 7 contains our conclusions and comments for future
developments of the present approach to other non-geometric vacuum congurations
that admit simple and handy algebraic descriptions [6, 9, 8].
in order to make the
paper as self-contained as possible, we have added two appendices. in appendix a we
set up our conventions and dene the conformal blocks that appear in the asymmetric
orbifolds under consideration.
in appendix b we have included an expansion of the

2 asymmetric orbifolds: a quick review

thanks to the large degree of independence between left and right movers on the string
worldsheet, one can conceive vacuum congurations in which one set of modes propa-
gates in a target space and the other in a completely dierent one. for closed strings,
modular invariance puts very tight constraints and the largest class of models of this
kind that have been constructed are the asymmetric orbifolds of narain, sarmadi and
vafa [2]. free fermionic [3] and covariant lattice [14] constructions have some overlap
with asymmetric orbifolds.

an asymmetric orbifold is obtained by quotienting a string compactication, typically
on a d-dimensional torus, by a discrete group, typically a cyclic group, that acts asym-
metrically on the left and right movers. for the heterotic string, that is left-right asym-
metric from the very beginning, this is rather natural. for the type ii superstrings,
in particular for the type iib superstring that is left-right symmetric, this may sound
slightly articial, but undoubtedly represents an improvement and an implementation

3

of the string potentialities beyond their eld-theory limit [25]. most of these asymmetric
constructions are still waiting for some geometric interpretation in terms of m-theory
or f-theory, if any.

we will concentrate most of our analysis on z l
compactications of the type iib superstring1 and their open-string descendants.

of so(8). for future reference, notice that this requires to turn on a quantized ns-

the explicit form of the chiral supertraces gh and lattice sums is given in appendix a.
the relative powers of two represent the number of xed points under the asymmetric
orbifold group actions. most of the amplitudes in (7) are in the same modular orbit as
the amplitudes in the untwisted sector and therefore the relevant number of xed points
(associated to cg,1) is easily determined from modular transformations. this is not the
case for the modular orbit (gl, hr) which is clearly disconnected from the untwisted
sector. by inspection of (5) one can easily see that cgl,hr = cgl,1 and therefore the
multiplicity of this orbit is again determined through modular transformations up to
a z2-phase, i.e. a sign. this phase, that we have denoted by  in (7), represents the
discrete torsion between the two z2 factors [12].
depending on the choice of discrete torsion,  = 1, the spectrum of massless oriented
closed-string states corresponds to compactications of the type iib theory on spaces
topologically equivalent to t 4 and k3, respectively. the resulting massless spectra of
closed oriented strings are:

where g and t stand for gravity and tensor super-multiplets respectively.

the klein-bottle amplitude is dened by the -projection of (7). clearly, left-right
asymmetric sectors, such as t01 or t10, will not contribute to this trace since states in
these sectors come always in  even-odd pairs. the result only involves the diagonal
components g1,g2g1,h1h2 and reads

this mechanism is automatic in terms of characters, i.e. n+  n characters appear
diagonally in the one-loop modular invariant (see appendix b).

as usual ns-ns (r-r) states owing along the klein-bottle (8) are (anti)symmetrized,
while one half of the remaining ones survives the -projection. the resulting spectra of
massless unoriented closed-string states are given by:

in order to determine the unoriented open-string spectrum, that one has to couple
to the above unoriented closed-string spectrum, we start by rewriting the klein-bottle

notice that for  = +1 terms proportional to i 2
c do not contribute to tadpoles
and therefore only the sum of the cp charges is xed: io = n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 = 16. this
restricts only the total rank of the cp gauge group. at the massless level one thus nds:

the models with n = (1, 1) correspond, at least topologically, to toroidal compacti-
cations without vector structure, i.e. with a reduction of the rank of the cp group
associated to a non-vanishing generalized second stieel-whitney class and measured
by the presence of a quantized ns-ns antisymmetric tensor [17, 20]. the model with
n = (1, 0) is chiral but anomaly-free thanks to the gss mechanism [33, 34] that involves
several antisymmetric tensors and is the eld-theory counterpart of the r-r tadpole con-
ditions [4]. notice that because of the chiral z2 action, that implies a quotienting by the
t-duality transformation x i
r for i = 1 . . . 4, would-be d9- and
d5-branes are eectively identied and form some generalized brane bound-state. this
accounts for a further reduction by half of the rank of the cp group. as mentioned in
the introduction, it is a dicult task to describe the above non-geometric vacuum con-
gurations in terms of d-branes and o-planes. their concepts become fuzzy in highly
curved or non-geometric backgrounds [8, 21]. in the case under consideration, however,
open-strings belonging to twisted sectors could be thought as strings with one end on a
would-be d5-branes and the other end on the would-be d9-brane, here described by an
unique cp charge ni. it is interesting to observe that the n = (1, 1) vector multiplets
are recovered in the  = +1 case by mixing the would-be d9-d9 and d5-d5 states with
the would-be d9-d5 states.

once again, the model with n = (1, 1) corresponds to a toroidal compactication with-
out vector structure [17, 20], while the model with n = (1, 0) is chiral but anomaly-free
thanks to the gss mechanism [33, 34]. notice that because of the chiral z3 action the
open-string spectrum involves states belonging to the twisted sectors. this should not
sound too surprising given the form of the torus amplitude.

number, 22, found in superstring compactications with n = 4 in d = 4. from the
type ii perspective, they correspond to compactications on manifolds that are locally,
but not necessarily globally, of the form k3  t 2. from the type i or, equivalently,
heterotic perspective, they correspond to toroidal compactications possibly with non-
commuting wilson lines [17, 20, 27, 28]. in fact, some candidate dual pairs descend
from the duality between type iia superstring on k3 and heterotic string on t 4 [29].
in the case under consideration, because of the chiral nature of the projections and
twistings, it is not easy to nd a geometric interpretation for the above superstring
vacuum congurations. still, the left-right symmetry of the resulting oriented closed-
string theory suggests that there is no reason to exceed the experimental bound of
22 on the number of vector multiplets. moreover no exotic brane whose excitations
could account for the extra vector multiplets has been proposed so far [26].

the  = 1 model is ir free. the cp group can be completely higgsed in the higgs branch
and the remaining massless hypermultiplets parametrize a non-trivial quaternionic man-
ifold which becomes hyperkaler in the rigid limit. the models with  = e 2i
3 are non
chiral and ir free. although phenomenologically not very appealing, they are interest-
ing in at least two respects. first, states belonging to the twisted sectors of the chiral
orbifold group appear in the open-string spectrum. second, at least for  = e 2i
3 , addi-
tional vector multiplets appear in the unoriented closed-string spectrum thus decreasing
the number of marginal deformations. the additional vectors belong to the r-r sector
and as such are not minimally coupled to the perturbative string excitations. it would
be interesting to identify the non-perturbative states that couple minimally to these
r-r elds. they would represent the generalization of the concept of d-brane in these
non-geometric compactications.

2 with non-supersymmetric open-string sectors

in recent times, there has been a lot of interest in constructing type i models with
brane supersymmetry breaking either at the string scale [23] or at the compactication
scale [22, 21, 24]. by this one means models in which supersymmetry is exact in the
bulk but it is broken along (a subset of) the branes4. clearly, because of the coupling
between the brane excitations and the bulk modes, supersymmetry breaking is then
transmitted to the whole system. so far, only geometric models have been considered.
we would like to observe that the same mechanism of supersymmetry breaking can be
exposed in the context of non-geometric models such as the ones discussed in the present
paper. to keep the discussion as simple as possible we will restrict our attention to a
non-supersymmetric version of the open-string descendant of the t 4/z l
2 orbifold
3this corrects an imprecise statement made in the last section of [35] concerning z3 orbifolds with

2  z r

quantized bij .

4alternatively one may consider models in which the theory in the bulk is less supersymmetric than

the theory on the branes [36].

discussed in section 2. supersymmetry breaking can be achieved by replacing the d-
branes, associated to the n3, n4 cp charges, with anti-d-branes, and modifying the
 action on the xed-point space. the resulting unoriented descendant is encoded in

can see that the replacements correspond precisely to ipping the signs of the mixed
(nm) rr-sectors, so that gh  
gh. as already discussed, this is interpreted as a
replacement of a (sub)set of would-be d-branes by the corresponding would-be anti-d-
branes. moreover, as mentioned in the introduction, we have relaxed our simplifying

ansatz ek = ea = fm. imposing this condition would have resulted into the supersym-

metric model of section 2 and would not have reached our aim of implementing the
mechanism of brane supersymmetry breaking.

depending on the choice of discrete torsion, the new klein-bottle projection leads to
the following massless unoriented closed-string spectra:

notice, in particular, that supersymmetry is broken only by open strings charged under
the anti d-brane gauge group (the second u (4) factor above).
it is easy to check
that both gauge and gravitational anomalies are absent, thanks to the vanishing of the
r-r tadpoles.
indeed, for the potential gauge anomaly of each u (4) cp group one
nds 2n  2(n + 8) + 4m = 0, while for the potential gravitational anomaly, one nds
(4  10  4  16  2  16)o + (29  11 + 10  273)c = 0. once the minimal ansatz is
left aside, it is interesting to exploit some extra freedom available in the  = 1 case.
since, as one can immediately see, no massless tadpoles are present in the transverse-
channel klein-bottle amplitude, there is no need of adding open strings and no brane
supersymmetry breaking is induced in this case. the resulting six dimensional model
is one of the most economic string realizations of n = (1, 1) supergravity coupled to 4
vector supermultiplets.

although there is no claim of phenomenological appeal, we would like to stress that the

14

potential applications of the above construction to non-geometric models are undoubtly
far reaching and deserve an extensive study. it would be interesting to study the connec-
tion of the above kind of models with stable non-bps congurations of branes studied
in the recent literature (see e.g. [37] and references therein).

7 conclusions and discussion

we have discussed some asymmetric orbifolds of the type iib superstring and their open
and unoriented string descendants.

a nice feature of the models is that the introduction of discrete torsion allows to break
half of the supersymmetries and relate topologically dierent compactications. we
have also shown that prior to the introduction of a non-trivial discrete torsion no exotic
phenomena [26] appear in the oriented closed-string theories. this has been obtained
after carefully taking into account the subtle phases that appear in the modular trans-
formations of the chiral amplitudes.

from the algebraic point of view, the introduction of discrete torsion allows one to
relate modular combinations of characters with extended symmetry and permutation
modular invariants. this gives a rationale for the various unoriented descendants found
by varying the choice of the modular invariant one-loop amplitudes in the type ii parent
theories. in particular, one is lead to speculate that some of the permutation modular
invariants can be found by chiral projections much in the same way as in the simple
asymmetric orbifold instances that have been considered above.
in these cases the
perturbatively dierent unoriented descendants may turn out to be non-perturbatively
equivalent when a proper action of the projection is implemented on the solitonic spectra
and interactions.

the consistency of the construction does not require a d-brane interpretation, that
would be fuzzy in non-geometric environments such as the above ones and to some
extent useless. at the string level, i.e. when high curvatures are present or when the
vacuum conguration has no direct geometric interpretation, algebraic constructions
such as boundary and crosscap states that can be extracted via techniques of unori-
ented descendants are much more rewarding. it is worth stressing that, although the
geometrical meaning of boundaries and crosscaps in the present context is obscure,
string techniques [38] can still allow one to determine the wz anomalous couplings of
the properly generalized solitonic objects to the bulk elds. the question of identifying
the non-perturbative (non)bps solitons in the above non-geometric backgrounds is still
open.

where with a prime () and a double prime () we denote characters corresponding to
non-supersymmetric chiral traces much in the same way as discussed in appendix a.
similar expressions, with   , correspond to the non-supersymmetric choice with
 = 1. it should be noticed that in this case only v ( v ) enters the transverse klein-
bottle amplitude. as already shown, v is massive, and a model without open-string
sector is perfectly consistent with both worldsheet and target-space requirements.
