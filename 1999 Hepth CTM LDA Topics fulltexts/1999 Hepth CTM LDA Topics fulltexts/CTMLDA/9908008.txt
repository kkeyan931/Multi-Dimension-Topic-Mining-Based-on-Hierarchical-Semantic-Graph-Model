two ways illustrating this. rst way use stanley-reisner relations toric geometry nd cohomology ring structure. 20because dealing non-compact spaces, need take caution applying mathematical facts

theory techniques yield. thus, besides two known string theory calabi-yau desingularizations, without discrete torsion, among thousands ones allowed mathematics, perhaps certain ks theories provide us exactly solvable descriptions new desingularizations gorenstein orbifolds. dismissed many issues paper, mainly many things known interpretation ks lg theories describing non-compact calabi- yau

presentation, largely ignored non-compact factor sl(2, ir)/u(1) u(1) projection onto integral charges. main focus paper lies classifying wzw modular invariants using geometry relevant information contained su(3)n/su(2) u(1) sector tensored theory26. despite eort, yet explanation priori expect nite subgroups classify certain modular invariants conformal systems beyond su(2) case. among questions ignored are: would integrable de- formations ks theory correspond terms geometry? include d-branes study? ks elds correspond non-compact ruled surfaces resolution; related sl(2, ir)/u(1)

orbifold c3/zzk, zzk su(3), isolated sin- gularity zzk = h 1 k (1, 2, 3)i gcd(k, i) = 1, i. particular, c3/zzk always non-isolated singularities k even. proof: let zzk = hi, = 1 k (1, 2, 3). easy see non-trivial element n zzk eigenvalue 1 gcd(k, i) = 1, i, rst claim thus follows theorem 2.1. now, since zzk su(3), satisfy condition 1 + 2 + 3 = 0 (mod k), implies k even, least one i, say 1, also even. let = gcd(1, k) 2. then, action non-trivial element k/m c3 xes rst coordinate thus produces non-isolated singularity along axis. furthermore, product two cyclic groups satisfying conditions yields isolated singularity orders coprime: corollary a.3 let zzk = h 1 su(3), 0 < < k 0 < gcd(k, i) = gcd(k, ties k k coprime. k (1, 2, 3)i su(3) zzk = h 1 3)i < k. assume k, k odd i) = 1, i. then, c3/zzk zzk isolated singulari- k ( 1, 2, proof: without loss generality, assume k < k. diagonal basis, represent non-trivial elements g zzk g zzk g = 1 k (a1, a2, a3) g = 1 k (b1, b2, b3), integers 0 < ai < k 0 < bi < k. see gg eigenvalue 1 (a.1) (a.2) ai k equivalently, ai = k(k bi) k + bi k = 1 i. now, assume gcd(k, k) = 1. then, (a.2) tells us order ai integer, k divide k bi, impossible. conversely, suppose gcd(k, k) = c > 1, k = cm k = cn positive coprime integers m, n. but, assumed k (a1, a2, a3) gcd(k, i) = gcd(k, i) = 1 i, elements g = 1 24 k (b1, b2, b3) d, 1 < c, a1 = dm b1 = n(c d). g = 1 then, a1 k + b1 k = a1n + b1m cmn = 1 thus, gg eigenvalue 1. corollary a.3 means zzk zzk = zzkk, zzkk must satisfy conditions corollary a.2. corollary 2.1 follows. 25
