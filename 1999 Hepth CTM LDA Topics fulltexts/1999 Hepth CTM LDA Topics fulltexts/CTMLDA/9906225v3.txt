abstract

we develop a general framework for quantum eld theory on non-
commutative spaces, i.e., spaces with quantum group symmetry. we
use the path integral approach to obtain expressions for n-point func-
tions. perturbation theory leads us to generalised feynman diagrams
which are braided, i.e., they have non-trivial over- and under-crossings.
we demonstrate the power of our approach by applying it to 4-theory
on the quantum 2-sphere. we nd that the basic divergent diagram
of the theory is regularised.

1 introduction

the idea that space-time might not be accurately described by ordinary
geometry was expressed already a long time ago.
it was then motivated
by the problems encountered in dealing with the divergences of quantum
eld theories. an early suggestion was that spatial coordinates might in
fact be noncommuting observables [27]. for a long time development has
been hampered by the lack of proper mathematical tools. only with the
advent of noncommutative geometry [5] and quantum groups have such ideas
taken a more concrete form. quantum groups emerged in fact from the
theory of integrable models in physics and were connected from the beginning
to the idea of noncommutative symmetries in physical systems [7, 11, 30].
it was then also suggested that they might play a role in physics at very
short distances [18]. the idea that quantum symmetry or noncommutativity
might serve as a regulator for quantum eld theories was emphasised in
[19] and [12]. the persistent inability to unite quantum eld theory with
gravity is a main motivation behind such considerations. in this context it is
interesting to note that noncommutative geometric structures are emerging
also in string theory [6]. despite progress in describing various physical
models on noncommutative spaces (see e.g. [17, 10, 4, 3]), an approach general
enough to be independent of a particular choice of noncommutative space
has been lacking. we aim at taking a step in this direction by providing
a framework for doing quantum eld theory on any noncommutative space
with quantum group symmetry.

the basic underlying idea of our approach is to take ordinary quantum
eld theory, formulate it in a purely algebraic language and then generalise
in this formulation to noncommutative spaces. it turns out that this gen-
eralisation is completely natural. it involves no arbitrary additional input
and no further choices (except for trivial choices like taking left or right ac-
tions). we start with two fundamental ingredients of quantum eld theory,
namely the space of elds together with the group of symmetries acting on
it. generalising to the noncommutative context, this means that we have
a vector space of elds coacted upon by a quantum group (which we take
to mean coquasitriangular hopf algebra) of symmetries. thus, the space of
elds becomes an object in the category of representations (comodules) of
the quantum group, which is braided 1.
i.e., we are naturally in the con-
text of braided geometry [21, chapter 10]. we emphasise that the braiding
is forced on us by the requirement of covariance under the quantum group

1recall that a braiding means that for two representations v ,w the intertwiner of the

tensor products v  w  w  v becomes nontrivial, i.e. dierent from the ip map.

symmetry and not introduced by hand. it also turns out (at least for our
example in section 5) that the braiding rather than the noncommutativity
itself is crucial to achieve regularisation of a conventional theory. this seems
to have been missed out in previous works. for previous indications that
noncommutativity is not necessarily sucient for regularisation see e.g. [8].
we follow the path integral approach, going from gaussian path integrals
via perturbation theory to feynman diagrams. in the noncommutative set-
ting this procedure naturally leads us to generalised feynman diagrams that
are braid diagrams, i.e., they have nontrivial over- and under-crossings.

for an algebraically rigorous treatment we require the quantum group of
symmetries to be cosemisimple corresponding to compactness in the commu-
tative case. however, when aiming to regularise uv-divergences this is not
necessarily a disadvantage, since they should not be aected by the global
properties of a space.

we start out in section 2 by dening normalised gaussian integrals on
braided spaces based on [13] naturally generalising gaussian integration on
commutative spaces. this provides us with the free n-point functions of a
braided quantum eld theory. developing perturbation theory in analogy to
ordinary quantum eld theory we obtain the braided analogues of feynman
diagrams. it turns out that symmetry factors of ordinary feynman diagrams
are resolved into dierent (and not necessarily equivalent) diagrams in the
braided case.

in section 3 we consider the case where the space of elds is a quan-
tum homogeneous space under the symmetry quantum group. inspired by
the conventional commutative case this gives us a more compact description
of n-point functions. furthermore, it allows for simplications in braided
feynman diagrams.

while our approach is somewhat formal up to this point, section 4 in-
troduces a context that allows us to work algebraically rigorously in innite
dimensions. we need a further assumption to do this, which corresponds in
the commutative case to the space-time being compact.

finally, in section 5 we deliver on the promise to perform q-regularisation
within braided quantum eld theory. to this end we consider 4-theory on
the standard quantum 2-sphere [26]. we make use of all the machinery
developed up to this point to show that the only basic divergence of 4-
theory in two dimensions, the tadpole diagram, becomes nite at q > 1. we
identify the divergence in q-space and suggest that it would not depend on
the conventional degree of divergence of a diagram.

by a quantum group we generally mean a hopf algebra equipped with
a coquasitriangular structure (see e.g. [21]. we denote the coaction by ,
the counit by , and the antipode by s. we use sweedlers notation [28]

3

 a = a(1)  a(2), etc., with summation implied. we apply the same notation
to hopf algebras in braided categories. the braiding is denoted by .

while working over a general eld k in sections 24 we specialise to the

complex numbers in section 5.

2 formal braided quantum field theory

we start out in this section by developing normalised gaussian integration
on braided spaces leading to a braided generalisation of wicks theorem.
the less algebraically minded reader may nd it convenient to proceed with
section 2.2 where braided path integrals are discussed in quantum eld the-
oretic language, and accept the main result of section 2.1 (theorem 2.1 and
its corollary) as given.

2.1 braided gaussian integration

braided categories arise as the categories of modules or comodules over quan-
tum groups (hopf algebras) with quasitriangular respectively coquasitrian-
gular structure (see e.g. [21]). the latter case will be the one of interest
to us later. we consider rigid braided categories, where we have for every
object x a dual object x  and morphisms ev : x  x   k (evaluation) and
coev : k  x   x (coevaluation) that compose to the identity in the ob-
vious ways. although rigidity usually implies nite dimensionality, we shall
see later (section 4) how we can deal with innite dimensional objects. the
dierentiation and gaussian integration on braided spaces that we require
were developed by majid [20] and kempf and majid [13] in an r-matrix
setting. (the special case of rn
q was treated earlier in [9].) we need a more
abstract and basis free formulation of the formalism so that we redevelop the
notions here. furthermore, our theorem 2.1 goes beyond [13, theorem 5.1].
recall that a braiding on a category of vector spaces is an assignment to
any pair of vector spaces v, w of an invertible morphism v,w : v  w 
w  v . these morphisms are required to be compatible with the ten-
sor product such that u,v w = (u,w  id)  (id v,w ) and u v,w =
(id u,w )  (u,v  id). if the category is a category of modules or comod-
ules of a quantum group the morphisms are the intertwiners. the braiding
then generalises the trivial exchange map v,w (v  w) = w  v which is an
intertwiner for representations of ordinary groups. in the following we simply
write  for the braiding if no confusion can arise as to the spaces on which
it is dened.

suppose we have some rigid braided category b and a vector space x  b.

4

essentially, we want to dene the (normalised) integral of functions  in the
coordinate ring on x multiplied by a gaussian weight function w, i.e., we
want to dene

z() := r w
r w

.

(1)

first, we need to specify this coordinate ring. we identify the dual space
x   b as the space of coordinate functions on x. this corresponds to the
situation in rn where a coordinate function is just a linear map from rn into
the real numbers. the polynomial functions on x are naturally elements of
the free unital tensor algebra over x ,

x n, with x 0 := 1 and x n := x       x 

,

{z

cx  :=

where 1 is the one-dimensional space generated by the identity. 1 plays
the role of the constant functions and the tensor product corresponds to

the product of functions. cx  naturally has the structure of a braided hopf

algebra (a hopf algebra in a braided category, see [21]) via

 a = a  1 + 1  a,

(a) = 0,

s a = a

for a  x  and , , s extend to cx  as braided (anti-)algebra maps. explic-

itly, the coproduct is dened inductively by the identity

  = (  )  (id   id)  (  )

thought of as encoding translations on x.

to make the notion of coordinate ring more precise, one could perhaps

of maps cx   cx   cx   cx . the braided hopf algebra structure can be
consider a kind of symmetrised quotient of cx  in analogy with the observa-

tion that coordinates commute in ordinary geometry. there seems to be no
obvious choice for such a quotient in the general braided case. remarkably,
however, such a choice is not necessary. in fact, the following discussion is
entirely independent of any relations, as long as they preserve the (graded)
braided hopf algebra structure.

the next step is the introduction of dierentials [20]. the space of co-
ordinate dierentials should be dual to the space x  of coordinate func-
tions. we just take x itself and dene dierentiation on x  by the pairing
ev : x  x   k in b. to extend dierentiation to the whole coordinate

5

ring cx , we note that the coproduct encodes coordinate translation. this

leads to the natural denition that

di := (bev  id)  (id  ) : x  cx   cx 

is dierentiation on cx . here, bev is the trivial extension of ev to x cx   k,
i.e., bev |xx n = 0 for n 6= 1. we also use the more intuitive notation
(a) := di(  a) for   x and a  cx . let   x and ,   cx . the
denition of bev gives at once

bev(  ) = bev(  ) () + bev(  ) ().

using that the coproduct is a braided algebra map, we obtain the braided
leibniz rule

() = () + 1(  )().

(2)

iteration yields

() = (ev  idn1)(  [n] ),

where n is the degree of  and

[n] := idn +  idn2 +    + n2,1  id +n1,1

is a braided integer. we adopt the convention of writing n,m for the braiding
between x n and x m (respectively 1

n,m for the inverse braiding).

as in [13] we view the gaussian weight w formally as an element of cx 

and dene its dierentiation via an isomorphism

 : x  x 

so that

(w) = ()w

for   x.

(3)

this expresses the familiar notion that dierentiating a gaussian weight
yields a coordinate function times the gaussian weight.  should accordingly
be thought of as dening a braided analogue of the quadratic form in the
exponential of the weight.

also familiar from ordinary gaussian integration is the fact that integrals

of total dierentials vanish. that is, we require

z (w) = 0

for

  x,   cx .

(4)

it turns out that the three rules (2), (3), and (4) completely determine the
integral (1).

6

remarkably, the statement that the gaussian integral of a polynomial
function can be expressed solely in terms of gaussian integrals of quadratic
functions still holds true in the braided case. this generalises what is known
in quantum eld theory as wicks theorem. to state it, we need another set
of braided integers [n]

 : x n  x n with

[n]

 := idn + idn2 1 +    + 1

1,n1,

(5)

 = 1
which are related to the original ones by [n]
the corresponding braided double factorials [2n  1]

1,n1  [n]. we also require
!! : x 2n  x 2n with

[2n  1]

!! := ([1]

  id2n1)  ([3]

  id2n3)      ([2n  1]

  id).

(6)

theorem 2.1 (braided wick theorem).

z |x 2 = ev   (id 1),

z |x 2n = (z |x 2)n  [2n  1]

!!, z |x 2n1 = 0,

n  n.

proof. for   cx  and a  x  we have

aw =  di(1(a)  w) =  di((  1(a))w) + (di (  1(a)))w

using the dierential property (3) of w and the braided leibniz rule (2).
applying z, we can ignore the total dierential and obtain

z(a) = z(di (  1(a))).

(7)

this gives us immediately

z(a) = 0

and

z(ab) = ev (a  1(b))

for b  x . we rewrite (7) to nd

z |x n = z |x n2  di (1  idn1)  n1,1

= z |x n2  (ev  idn2)  (1  [n  1])  n1,1
= (ev  z |x n2)  (1  [n  1])  n1,1
= (ev  z |x n2)  n1,1  ([n  1]  1)
= (z |x 2  z |x n2)  (id n2,1)  ([n  1]  id)
= (z |x n2  z |x 2)  1
= (z |x n2  z |x 2)  (1
= (z |x n2  z |x 2)  ([n  1]

2,n2  (id n2,1)  ([n  1]  id)
1,n2  id)  ([n  1]  id)

  id),

which gives us a recursive denition of z leading to the formulas stated.

another set of the braided integers

[n]

 := idn +1  idn2 +    + 1

1,n1

with [2n  1]

!! := (id [2n  1]

)    (id2n3 [3]

)(id2n1 [1]
)

serves to formulate the dual version of the theorem.

corollary 2.2. let z k  x k denote the dual of z |x k. then

z 2n = [2n  1]

z 2 =   (1  id)  coev,
!! (z 2)n, z 2n1 = 0,

n  n,

proof. this is obtained from theorem 2.1 by reversing of arrows or equiv-
alently by turning diagrams upside down in the diagrammatic language of
braided categories.

2.2 braided path integrals

the n-point function of an ordinary quantum eld theory with action s,
evaluated at (x1, . . . , xn) is given by the path integral2

h(x1)    (xn)i = r d (x1)    (xn)es()

.

r d es()

this is really the normalised integral of the functional  7 (x1)    (xn)
with weight w() = es() over the space x of classical elds of the theory.
the parameters xi denote here points in space-time as well as additional
internal eld indices.

for the non-interacting theory the action s is replaced by the free action
s0. the path integral is then a gaussian integral and the decomposition of
n-point functions into 2-point functions (propagators) is governed by wicks
theorem. generalising to braided spaces (when the symmetry group is al-
lowed to be a quantum group) we are in the framework of section 2.1. then,
the value of an n-point function is still given in terms of values of 2-point
functions (propagators). this is the result of theorem 2.1 which generalises
wicks theorem. the (unevaluated) n-point function z n itself is an element
in the n-fold tensor product x n of the space of elds x and we write

z n(x1, . . . , xn) = h(x1)    (xn)i0,

2the euclidean signature of the action is chosen for deniteness and does not imply a

restriction to euclidean eld theory.

8

the index 0 indicating that we deal with the free theory. the decomposition
of z n into propagators z 2 is given by corollary 2.2, which is theorem 2.1
in dual form, i.e., for unevaluated functions.

the connection between the map  determining the (unevaluated) propa-
gator according to theorem 2.1 (corollary 2.2) and the free action in ordinary
quantum eld theory is as follows. let  be some dierential with respect to
the space of elds. the denition of  in (3) corresponds to

((es0))() = (())()es0(),

in ordinary quantum eld theory. thus we obtain

(())() = (s0)().

(8)

to determine interacting n-point functions, we use the same perturbative
techniques as in ordinary quantum eld theory. for s = s0 + sint with
coupling constant , we expand

z n

int(x1, . . . , xn) = h(x1)    (xn)i

= r d (x1)    (xn)(1  sint() + . . . )es0()

r d (1  sint() + . . . )es0()

h(x1)    (xn)i0  h(x1)    (xn)sint()i0 + . . .

=

1  hsint()i0 + . . .

.

for sint of degree k we can write

h(x1) . . . (xn)sint()i0 = ((idn sint) z n+k)(x1, . . . , xn)

etc. by viewing sint as a map x k  k. then, removing the explicit evalua-
tions we obtain

z n

int =

z n (idn sint)(z n+k) + 1

1  sint(z k) + 1

22(idn sint  sint)(z n+2k) + . . .
22(sint  sint)(z 2k) + . . .

,

(9)

an expression for the interacting n-point function valid in the general braided
case. vacuum contributions cancel as usual. note that we have used the
ordinary exponential expansion for the interaction and not, say, a certain
braided version. the latter might be more natural if, e.g., one wants to
look at identities between diagrams of dierent order. however, we shall not
consider this issue here.

2.3 braided feynman diagrams

we are now ready to generalise feynman diagrams to our braided setting. to
do this we use and modify the diagrammatic language of braided categories
appropriately:

 an n-point function is an element in x      x (n-fold). thus, its
diagram is closed to the top and ends in n strands on the bottom. any
strand represents an element of x, i.e., a eld.

 the propagator z 2  x  x is represented by an arch, see figure 1.a.

 an n-leg vertex is a map x      x  k.

it is represented by
n strands joining in a dot, see figure 1.b. notice that the order of
incoming strands is relevant.

 over- and under-crossings correspond to the braiding and its inverse,

see figure 2.

 any feynman diagram is built out of propagators, (possibly dierent
kinds of) vertices, and strands with crossings, connecting the propaga-
tors and vertices, or ending at the bottom.

otherwise the usual rules of braided diagrammatics apply. notice that in
contrast to ordinary feynman diagrams all external legs end on one line
(the bottom line of the diagram) and are ordered. this is necessary due to
the possible non-trivial braid statistics in our setting. for the case of trivial
braiding we can relax this and shift the external legs around as well as change
the order of strands at vertices so as to obtain ordinary feynman diagrams
in more familiar form.

the diagrams for the free 2n-point functions can be read o directly
from corollary 2.2. the crossings are encoded in the braided integers [j]
.
figure 3 shows for example the free 4-point function and figure 4 the free
6-point function. for the interacting n-point functions we use formula (9)
to obtain the diagrams. sint gives us the vertices. consider for example the
2-point function in euclidean 4-theory. to order  we get

z 2

int = z 2 (cid:0)(id2 sint)(z 6)  z 2 sint(z 4)(cid:1) + o(2).

sint is just the map 1234 7r 1234. to obtain the diagrams at

order  we start by drawing the free 6-point function (figure 4) and attach to
the 4 rightmost strands of each diagram a 4-leg vertex (figure 1.b). those
diagrams are generated by the rst term in brackets of (10). we realise
that the rst three of our diagrams are vacuum diagrams which are exactly

(10)

cancelled by the second term in the brackets. the remaining 12 diagrams
are shown in figure 5. in ordinary quantum eld theory they all correspond
to the same diagram: the tadpole diagram, see figure 6. however, not all
of them are necessarily dierent, as we shall see in section 3.2.

3 braided qft on homogeneous spaces

in ordinary quantum eld theory xing one point of an n-point function
still allows to recover the whole n-point function. thus, we can reduce an
n-point function to a function of just n  1 variables. this is simply due
to the fact that any n-point function is invariant under the isometry group
g of the space-time m and g acts transitively on m.
in this case m is
a homogeneous space under g and we can make the above statement more
precise in the following way.

lemma 3.1. let g be a group and k a subgroup of g. for any n  n there
is an isomorphism of coset spaces

n : (k\g      k\g

)/g = (k\g      k\g

n : [b1, . . . , bn1] 7 [b1, . . . , bn1, e] for bi  k\g, where e denotes
the equivalence class of the identity in k\g. if g is a topological group (i.e.,
it is a topological space and multiplication and inversion are continuous),
then equipping the coset spaces with the induced topologies makes n into a
homeomorphism.

if space-time is an ordinary manifold we can obviously do the same trick
in braided quantum eld theory. more interestingly, however, we can extend
it to noncommutative space-times.

3.1 quantum homogeneous spaces

lemma 3.1 generalises to the quantum group case. to see this we rst recall
the notion of a quantum homogeneous space.

suppose we have two hopf algebras a and h together with a hopf algebra
surjection  : a  h. this induces coactions l = (  id)   and
r = (id )   of h on a, making a into a left and right h-comodule
algebra. dene ha to be the left h-invariant subalgebra of a, i.e., ha =
{a  a|l(a) = 1  a}. we have  ha  ha  a since (l  id)   =
(id  )  l. this makes ha into a right a-comodule (and h-comodule)
algebra. observe also that (a) = (a)1 for a  ha. ha is called a right
quantum homogeneous space. dene the left quantum homogeneous space
ah correspondingly. due to the anti-coalgebra property of the antipode we
nd s ha  ah and s ah  ha. if the antipode is invertible, the inclusions
become equalities.

proposition 3.2. in the above setting with invertible antipode the map

n : (ha      ha

)a  (ha      ha

)h

given by n = (idn1  ) for n  n is an isomorphism.
its inverse is
(idn1  s)  n1, where n1 is the right coaction of a on ha extended
to the (n  1)-fold tensor product.

proof. let a1      an be an element of (ha      ha)a. in particular,

a1

(1)      an

(1)  a1

(2)    an

(2) = a1      an  1.

applying the antipode to the last component and multiplying with the n-th
component we obtain

a1

(1)      an1

(1)  (an) s(a1

(2)    an1

(2)) = a1      an.

(11)

13

thus, (idn1  s)  n1  (idn1  ) is the identity on (ha      ha)a.
on the other hand, applying the inverse antipode and then  to the last
component of (11) we get

a1

(1)      an1

(1)  (an)(a1

(2)    an1

(2)) = a1      an1  (an)1.

this is to say that a1      an1 (an) is indeed right h-invariant.

conversely, it is clear that (idn1  )  (idn1  s)  n1 = (idn1  ) 
n1 is the identity. now take b1      bn1 in (ha      ha)h. its image
under n1 is

b1

(1)      bn1

(1)  b1

(2)    bn1

(2).

(12)

applying  to the last component we get

b1

(1)      bn1

(1)  (b1

(2)    bn1

(2)) = b1      bn1  1

by right h-invariance. applying n1  id we arrive at

b1

(1)      bn1
= b1

(2)    bn1

(1)  b1
(1)      bn1

(2)  (b1

(3)    bn1

(1)  b1

(2)    bn1

(3))
(2)  1.

we observe that this is the same as applying (idn1 r) to (12). thus, the
last component of (12) lives in ah and the application of the antipode sends
it to ha as required. that the result is right a-invariant is also clear by the
dening property of the antipode.

to make use of the result we assume our space x of elds to be a quantum
homogeneous space under a quantum group (coquasitriangular hopf algebra)
a of symmetries. (note that coquasitriangularity implies invertibility of the
antipode.) that is, together with a we have another hopf algebra h and a
hopf algebra surjection a  h. we then assume that the algebra of elds is
the right quantum homogeneous space x = ha living in the braided category
ma of right a-comodules.

3.2 diagrammatic techniques

proposition 3.2, to which we shall refer as invariant reduction, is not only
useful to express n-point functions in a more compact way, but can also be
applied in the evaluation of braided feynman diagrams. for this we note that
any horizontal cut of a braided feynman diagram lives in some tensor power
of x (since the only allowed strand lives in x) and is invariant (since the
diagram is closed at the top). thus, we can apply invariant reduction to it.

14

we shall give three examples for this, assuming vertices that are evaluated
by multiplication and subsequent integration. here, any quantum group
invariant linear map x  k is admissible as the integral.

vertex evaluation. consider the evaluation of an n-leg vertex (the hori-
zontal slice of an invariant diagram depicted in figure 7) with incoming
elements a1      ak+n. by invariant reduction this can be expressed
in two ways,

a1      akz ak+1    ak+n
= a1(1)      ak (1) (ak+1)    (ak+n)z s(a1(2)    ak (2))

depending on the circumstances each side might be easier to evaluate.

loop extraction. assume that the integral on ha is normalised, r 1 =

1. consider the diagram in figure 8 (left-hand side). it is obviously
invariant. thus, the single outgoing strand carries a multiple of the
identity and we can replace it by the integral followed by the identity
element (figure 8, right-hand side).

loop separation. we assume further that the coquasitriangular structure

r : h  h  k is trivial on hah in the sense

r(a  b) = (a) (b),

if a  hah or b  hah.

(13)

consider now the diagram in figure 9 (left-hand side) as a horizontal
slice of an invariant diagram. according to invariant reduction we apply
the counit to the rightmost outgoing strand. this makes the braiding
trivial due to the assumed property of r. we can push the counit up
to each of the joining strands and disentangle them. then proceeding
as in the previous example leads to the diagram in figure 9 (right-hand
side). note that this works the same way for an under-crossing.

let us come back to the 2-point function of 4 theory that we considered

at the end of section 2.3. assuming r 1 = 1 and property (13) we can

use loop extraction and loop separation to simplify the order 1 diagrams
of figure 5 considerably. the result is shown in figure 10. instead of 12
dierent diagrams we only have 2 dierent and much simpler diagrams, each
with a multiplicity of 6.

4 braided qft on compact spaces

4.1 braided spaces of innite dimension

up to now we have developed our approach on a formal level insofar, that
we have not addressed the question how an innite dimensional space (of
elds) can be treated in a braided category. this is certainly necessary if we
want to do quantum eld theory, i.e., deal with innitely many degrees of
freedom. an obvious problem is the denition of the coevaluation. it seems
that we need at least a completed tensor product for this. however, instead
of introducing heavy functional analytic machinery, we can stick with our
algebraic approach given a further assumption.

let us assume that the space of (regular) elds x decomposes into a

direct sumli xi of countably many nite dimensional comodules under the

symmetry quantum group a. this corresponds roughly to the classical case
of the space-time manifold being compact.
in particular, it is the case if
the symmetry quantum group a is cosemisimple (or classically the lie group
of symmetries is compact, see section 4.2 below). denote the projection
x  xi by i.

we now allow arbitrary sums of elements in x given that any projection
i annihilates all but nitely many summands. similarly, we allow innite
sums in the n-fold tensor product x n with the restriction that any projection
i1      in yields a nite sum. to dene the dual of x, we take the dual of
i . for each component xi we have an evaluation
in
i ) and coev =

each xi and set x  =li x 
the usual way. we then formally dene ev = pi evi (i   
pi coevi.

our denition is invariant under coactions of a as it should be, since the
projections i commute with the coaction of a. in particular, it is invariant
under braidings.

4.2 cosemisimplicity and peter-weyl decomposition

we describe a context in which all comodules over a hopf algebra decompose
into nite dimensional (and even simple) pieces. the discussion here uses
results of [28] but is more in the spirit of [2, ii.9]. assume k to be algebraically
closed, e.g., k = c.

let c be a coalgebra, v a simple right c-comodule (i.e. v has no proper
subcomodules) with coaction  : v  v  c.
in particular, v is nite
dimensional. the dual space v  is canonically a (simple) left c-comodule.
denote a basis of v by {ei}, the dual basis of v  by {f i}.
identify the

17

endomorphism algebra on v , end v = v  v  via (ei  f j)(ek  f l) = j
k(ei 
f l). we denote the dual coalgebra by (end v ) and identify (end v ) =

v   v via (f i  ej) =pk(f i  ek)  (f k  ej).

now consider the map (end v )  c given by f i  ej 7 (f i  id)  (ej).
it is an injective (since v is simple) coalgebra map. we extend this to the
direct sum of all inequivalent simple comodules. the resulting map

mv

(end v )  c

it is an isomorphism of coalgebras if and only if
is a coalgebra injection.
all c-comodules are semisimple (i.e. they are direct sums of simple ones) or
equivalently if c is semisimple (i.e. it is a direct sum of simple coalgebras).
assume now that a is a cosemisimple hopf algebra, i.e., a is semisimple

as a coalgebra. we write the above decomposition as

a =mv

(v   v ).

(14)

it is also referred to as the peter-weyl decomposition, in analogy to the
corresponding decomposition of the algebra of regular functions on a compact
lie group. there is a unique normalised left- and right-invariant integral
(haar measure) on a, given by the induced projection to the unit element in
a. note also that the antipode is invertible.

consider a second hopf algebra h with a hopf algebra surjection  :
a  h. this induces a coaction of h on each a-comodule. for the right
quantum homogeneous space we have

ha =mv

(h(v )  v )

(15)

as right h-comodules.

5 4-theory on the quantum 2-sphere

in accordance with the motivation of braided quantum eld theory as a
way of regularising ordinary quantum eld theory, we replace lie groups of
symmetries by corresponding parametric deformations. in order to have a
well dened theory in the sense of section 4 we make use of the peter-weyl
decomposition and thus restrict to compact lie groups. a natural choice
are the standard q-deformations of lie groups with compact -structure. we
specialise to k = c, although the discussion of the free action in section 2.2

18

was in the spirit of real-valued scalar eld theory. this is necessary since
the standard q-deformations viewed as deformations of complexications of
compact lie groups do not restrict to real subalgebras for q 6= 1. however,
viewing q-deformation purely as a mathematical tool we can always restrict
to r when considering physical quantities living at q = 1.

in the following we consider perturbative 4-theory on the quantum 2-
sphere with suq(2)-symmetry as an example of a quantum eld theory on a
braided space. ordinary 4-theory in 2 dimensions is super-renormalisable
and has just one basic divergence: the tadpole diagram (figure 6). (see
e.g. [31] for a treatment of ordinary 4-theory.) we demonstrate that this
diagram becomes nite for q > 1. our hopf algebra of symmetries is suq(2)
under which s2
q is a homogeneous space as a right comodule. (we adopt the
convention to denote the hopf algebra of regular functions by the name of
the (quantum) group or space.)

5.1 the decomposition of suq(2) and s2
q

to prepare the ground we need to recall the construction of s2
q as a quantum
homogeneous space under suq(2) and the peter-weyl decomposition of the
latter [15, 25]. this will enable us to apply the machinery of the previous
sections.

recall that suq(2) is the compact real form of slq(2) for q real which
we assume in the following. (see appendix a for the dening relations.) it
is cosemisimple and there is one simple (right) comodule vl for each integer
dimension, conventionally labelled by a half-integer l such that the dimension
is 2l + 1. thus, the peter-weyl decomposition (14) is

suq(2) = ml 1

(v 

l  vl).

there is a hopf -algebra surjection  : suq(2)  u(1) corresponding
(see appendix a for
to the diagonal inclusion in the commutative case.
an explicit denition of .) this denes the quantum 2-sphere s2
q as the
right quantum homogeneous -space u (1)suq(2). under the coaction of u(1)
induced by  the comodules vl decompose into inequivalent one-dimensional
comodules classied by integers. (this is the usual representation theory of
u(1).) this determines up to normalisation a basis {v(l)
n } for vl with half-
integers n taking values l, l + 1, . . . , l. in particular, we nd that v u (1)
is one-dimensional if l is integer and zero-dimensional otherwise. thus, (15)

as right suq(2)-comodules. we write the induced (normalisation indepen-
dent) basis vectors of suq(2) as t(l)

(16)

this can be easily worked out considering the equation (a) = r a(1) s a(2)
and using the invariance of the integral in the form b(1)r ab(2) = s a(1)r a(2)b
and s b(2)r ab(1) = a(2)r a(1)b on basis elements. the q-integers for q  c are

dened as

[n]q :=

n1xk=0

qn2k1 =

qn  qn
q  q1 .

(the second expression is only dened for q2 6= 1).

m n} by {t(l)

denoting a dual basis of {t(l)

m n}, we observe that suq(2) be-
comes an object in msuq(2), the category of right comodules over suq(2)
by equipping it with the coaction t(l)
n k. we then have
an evaluation map ev : suq(2)  suq(2)  c and a coevaluation map
coev : c  suq(2)  suq(2) in the obvious way.

m n 7 pk

t(l)
m k  s1 t(l)

in the commutative case q = 1, the basis {t(l)

m n} becomes the usual basis of
regular functions (i.e., matrix elements of representations) on su(2) (see e.g.

20

[29, chapter 6] to whose conventions we conform in this case). the restriction
to {t(l)
0 n} recovers nothing but (a version of) the spherical harmonics on s2.
in particular, we notice that the zonal spherical functions can be expressed
in terms of legendre polynomials t(l)
0 0(, , ) = pl(cos ), where , ,  are
the euler angles on su(2) (see [29, chapter 6]). from the orthogonality
relation of the legendre polynomials, the fact that their only common value
is at pl(1) = 1, and considering that  = 0 denotes a pole of su(2), we
nd that the delta function at the identity of su(2) restricted to s2 can be
represented as

0(, ) =xl

(2l + 1) pl(cos ) =xl

(2l + 1) t(l)

0 0(, ).

(17)

recall that a coquasitriangular structure r : h  h  k on a quantum

group h determines a braiding between right comodules v and w via

(v  w) = w(1)  v(1)r(v(2)  w(2))

for v  v and w  w . (we use here sweedlers coproduct notation for the
coaction.) for calculations we need the functionals u and v dened with r
as (see e.g. [21])

u(a) := r(a(2)  s a(1)),

v(a) := r(a(1)  s a(2))

(18)

for a  h. for h = suq(2) in our basis they are

u(t(l)

m n) = m,n q2l(l+1)+2m,

v(t(l)

m n) = m,n q2l(l+1)2m.

(19)

we also note that property (13) is satised, i.e.,

r(cid:16)t(l)

0 0  t(l)

i j(cid:17) = i,j = r(cid:16)t(l)

i j  t(l)

0 0(cid:17) .

(20)

see appendix b for a derivation of (19) and (20).

5.2 the free propagator

in ordinary quantum eld theory the free propagator is dened by the free
action. for a euclidean massive real scalar eld theory on a manifold m it
takes the form

s0() =

1

2zm

dx (x)(m2  m )(x),

21

where m is the laplace operator on m and m is the mass of the eld.
dene l := m2  m . let {i} be a basis of x and {
i } a dual basis.
denote the dierential with respect to i by i. we have

(is0)() =zm

dx (x)li(x) =xk

k()zm



dx k(x)li(x).

comparing with equation (8) we obtain in the more abstract notation of
section 2.1

 =(cid:18)id zm(cid:19)  (id )  (coev l),

(21)

which we take as the dening equation for . while initially well dened
only at q = 1 we extend it to the noncommutative realm in the following.

first, note that at q 6= 1 we still have a well dened integral on our
manifold m = s2
q , namely the induced haar measure of suq(2). next, we
need an analogue of the laplace operator. by the duality of suq(2) with the
quantum enveloping algebra uq(sl2), a central element of the latter denes
an invariant operator on suq(2)-comodules. a natural choice is the quantum
casimir element which we dene as

cq = ef +

(k  1)q1 + (k 1  1)q

(q  q1)2

.

here k, k 1, e, and f are the generators of uq(sl2) (see appendix b). cq
diers from quantum casimir elements considered elsewhere (see e.g. [25]
or [14]) only by a q-multiple of the identity. the eigenvalue of cq on vl is
[l]q[l + 1]q so that we get exactly the (negative of the) usual laplace operator
for q = 1. including a mass term we set

l = cq + m2.

thus, the eigenvalue of l on vl is

ll = [l]q[l + 1]q + m2.

we determine  according to (21). using (16) we nd

(cid:16)t(l)

5.3

interactions

we proceed to evaluate the order 1 contribution of the 4-interaction to the
2-point function. the corresponding diagrams are depicted in figure 5 (see
section 2.3). since the property (13) holds in suq(2) the diagrams simplify
to those of figure 10 (see section 3.2). the disconnected loop comes out as

loop :=

=xl

[2l + 1]q

[l]q[l + 1]q + m2 q2l(l+1).

(23)

(just apply the counit to (22).) the connected diagram in the right-hand
summand of figure 10 is (in reduced form)

=(cid:18)id   z (cid:19)  (id2 )  (id  z 2  id)  z 2

we have also used the invariance of the integral in the form (r ab(2))b(1) =
(r a(2)b) s a(1) in the third equality. thus, the (reduced) 2-point function up

to order 1 comes out as

(24)

in the commutative case (q = 1), we know that the order 1 contribution
(given by the tadpole diagram in figure 6) is divergent. we can easily see
where this divergence comes from. the loop contribution (23)

loop|q=1 =xl

2l + 1

l(l + 1) + m2

24

(25)

is innite. however, at q > 1 it becomes nite. we are truly able to regularise
the tadpole diagram. let us identify the divergence in q-space. for q > 1 we
can nd both an upper and a lower bound for (23) of the form

const +z 

1

dl

2
l

q2l2

,

where const does not depend on q (but may depend on m2). setting q = e2h2
with h > 0 we nd

loop|q>1 =

1
h

+ o(1).

the conventional divergence of (25) is only logarithmic in l. what would
happen with higher divergences? it seems natural to assume that they would
give rise to terms like

xl

[l]n

q q2l(l+1).

but this converges in the domain q > 1 for any n. we can even apply the
very same discussion of the divergence in q-space as above. the nature of
the divergence in q-space does not seem to be aected by the degree of the
ordinary (commutative) divergence at all. this suggests that q-regularisation
in our framework is powerful indeed.

reviewing our calculations of z 2 and z 2

int we nd that the crucial factor
of q2l(l+1) is caused by the braiding. thus, the braiding and not the mere
noncommutativity appears to be essential for the regularisation.

5.4 renormalisation

ordinarily, 4-theory in dimension 2 is super-renormalisable. the only basic
divergent diagram is the tadpole (figure 6). our approach yields a simple and
diagrammatic way to renormalise it. we have used above the loop separation
technique of section 3.2 (figure 9) to factorise the single tadpole diagram(s)
into 2-vertex diagrams and the loop factor loop. for any given diagram we
can perform the same operation for all tadpole subdiagrams appearing in it.
the remaining diagram (with the loop factors removed) is nite at q = 1,
since the commutative theory has no further divergences.

however, from a rigorous point of view this procedure can only be per-
formed if the diagram we start out with is nite. while we have seen that the
tadpole diagram alone becomes nite for q > 1, it is conceivable that certain
diagrams that converge at q = 1 would diverge at q > 1. this might be due

25

to the introduction of factors like q2l(l+1) into summations over l. the ex-
pression (24) suggests, however, that this does not happen, but rather that
all q-factors introduced in summations have negative exponent. we shall
assume this in the following.

let us perform the usual mass renormalisation in our framework. we
introduce an extra perturbative mass term which generates diagrams with
2-vertices. these diagrams are then used to cancel the corresponding dia-
grams where the 2-vertices are the remnants of the factorisation of tadpole
subdiagrams. to eect the cancellation the perturbative mass term must
carry the same factor loop as the factorised tadpoles. to compensate for the
dierent combinatoric multiplicity of quadratic and quartic vertices we need
an extra factor of 6 in front of the 2-vertex. since a mass term carries an
overall factor of 1/2 in the action, the eective mass shift is

m2  m2  12 loop.

performing this (nite) mass renormalisation at q > 1, only the divergence-
free diagrams without tadpoles remain as q  1 at any given order in per-
turbation theory.

6 concluding remarks

we have presented a coherent framework for the treatment of quantum eld
theory on braided spaces. in particular, we have developed a quantum group
covariant perturbation theory.

the example of 4-theory on the quantum 2-sphere has shown that quan-
tum deformations of symmetries do lead to the regularisation of divergences
in our approach. this method is superior to regularisation methods such
as using a lattice or fuzzy spaces in that it does not resort to discrete ap-
proximations with only nitely many degrees of freedom. on the other hand
it does not suer from the crude breaking of symmetries as many quantum
eld theoretic methods do (e.g. momentum cut-o, dimensional regularisa-
tion, lattice). however, symmetries are not preserved as such, but deformed
to quantum group symmetries. our results also suggest that divergences of
arbitrary order could be regularised in this way.

a next step would be the investigation of quantum eld theories on defor-
mations of higher dimensional spaces to obtain more physically interesting
models. we note in particular that quantum deformations of minkowski
space are available (see [1, 22] and [16, 23]). further one would like to in-
clude internal (quantum group) symmetries as well. in particular, this might

26

open new possibilities for the old idea of unifying internal and external sym-
metries.

in a dierent direction, one might speculate that the braided feynman di-
agrams obtained from theories with q-deformed symmetries have interesting
number theoretic properties related to modular functions. this is suggested
by the observation of such properties for the quantum rank of q-deformed
enveloping algebras [24].

b coquasitriangular structure of suq(2)

in this appendix we provide the formulas for the coquasitriangular structure
of suq(2) in the peter-weyl basis needed in section 5. we use the context
of section 5.1. denitions and results that are just stated are standard and
can be found e.g. in [21] or [14].

the hopf algebra uq(sl2) is dened over c for q  c and q2 6= 1 with

generators e, f, k, k 1 and relations

kek 1 = q2e, kf k 1 = q2f,

kk 1 = k 1k = 1,

[e, f ] =

k  k 1
q  q1 ,

(e) = e  k + 1  e, (f ) = f  1 + k 1  f,

(k) = k  k,
s(k) = k 1,

(e) = (f ) = 0,
s(f ) = kf.

(k) = 1,

s(e) = ek 1,

uq(sl2) and suq(2) are non-degenerately paired. thus, actions of uq(sl2)
and coactions of suq(2) on nite dimensional vector spaces are dual to each
other. in particular, the simple comodule vl of suq(2) is a simple module
of uq(sl2). by the representation theory of uq(sl2) it has a basis {wi}, i =
l, l + 1, . . . , l such that

k  wm = q2mwm, e  wm = ([l  m]q[l + m + 1]q)1/2wm+1

f  wm = ([l + m]q[l  m + 1]q)1/2wm1.

(26)

uq(sl2) has an h-adic version uh(sl2) dened over c[[h]] correspondingly
it has the

act on vl as [21, proposition 3.2.7]

u  wm = q2l(l+1)+2mwm,

v  wm = q2l(l+1)2mwm.

(29)

the coquasitriangular structure r of suq(2) is given by the duality with

uq(sl2) from the quasitriangular structure r of uh(sl2). using

u(a(1))a(2) = s2 a(1)u(a(2))

and v(a(1)) s2 a(2) = a(1)v(a(2))

since the denitions (18) and (28) are dual to each other we can use

k k(cid:17) .
m n(cid:1) = m,n q2(km)v(cid:16)t(l)
v(cid:0)t(l)

to compare (29) with (30). we nd (19) and infer that wi is (a multiple of)
vi. with the latter, the pairing between uq(sl2) and suq(2) comes out from
(26) as

hk, t(l)

m ni = m,n q2n,

he, t(l)

m ni = m,n+1([l  n]q[l + n + 1]q)1/2,

hf, t(l)

m ni = m,n1([l + n]q[l  n + 1]q)1/2.

note also hh, t(l)
(27) we easily verify the property (20).

m ni = m,n2n in the h-adic version. with this pairing and
