attention concentrated non-local objects like strings p-branes. therefore, high energy eects described strings, low energies one meets eective gravity actions, may einstein- hilbert one include additional elds, dilaton. already noticed s. weinberg  quantum gravity based general relativity may consistent quantum theory restricted low-energy domain. idea eective approach quantum gravity realized recent paper f. donoghue , used perform practical calculation leading long-distance quantum correction newton potential 4 (see also  general explanation eective approach). work attracted considerable interest raised hopes apply background eective quantum gravity problems. however, concerning original calculations quantum gravity , questions still remain unanswered. calculation implies two important suppositions. first, one deal separation long-distance eects, related non-local part eective action, uv divergent pieces may always subtracted adding local counterterms. indeed, counterterms plenty higher derivatives, may removed renormalization corresponding high derivative terms action. terms, turn, invisible low energies, corresponding degrees freedom large masses. second, part long-distance contributions feynman diagrams proportional well-known uv divergences, enables one greatly reduce volume calculations . part composed logarithmic (l-type ) non-analytic terms, come diagrams massless internal lines. time, one-loop diagrams produce, along l-type structures, (s-type ) non-analytic terms, absolutely independent uv divergences. indeed, kind terms gives leading contribution long-distance quantum corrections. original papers  published, series works devoted correction checking. particular,  pointed error calculation one-loop contribution vertex function,  found relevant diagrams accounted 5. time, 4similar calculation done long ago iwasaki . 5unfortunately, authors  provide sucient details calculation. here, start analysis diagrams considered . indeed, consideration going general, since adopt gauge-xing condition depending arbitrary parameter, also present 2  applied functional methods calculation. however, succeeded extracting l-type non-analytic terms, easily obtained 1-loop logarithmic divergences. leading s-type non-localities cannot achieved way, still necessary use diagrams. one notice s-type non-localities appear due mixed loops massive massless internal lines, corresponding diagrams subject appelquist-carazzone theorem . indeed, mixed diagrams produce l-type nonlocalities, too. thus, present, set alternative results quantity (quantum correction newton potential), other. another subtle point scheme gauge-independence result. instance, original calculation  used polarization operator obtained , well-known gauge-dependent . one argue that, related scattering amplitude, quantum corrections potential gauge-independent. thus, one expects gauge-xing dependence polarization operator must cancel one coming vertex. however, non-standard aspects eective scheme make explicit check gauge-independence reasonable. mention verication successfully done , l-type terms, question s-type terms remains open. practical calculations eective quantum gravity meet two kind technical diculties. first, problems extracting non-analytic pieces diagrams massless massive internal lines (s-type terms). complexity operation greatly increases number massive insertions. second problem huge amount algebraic steps necessary calculations diagrams quantum gravity, especially general non-minimal gauges. view this, present paper, choose working model scalar quantum electrodynamics (sqed), volume algebraic work essentially reduced. important sqed almost diagrams one meets quantum gravity, also diagrams power-counting ir divergences. hence, course calculation, one learn better select relevant diagrams also develop technique extracting non-local pieces diagrams. paper organized follows. section 2, present backgrounds model,

(19) one notice expressions gauge-dependent integrals look similar. procedure show gauge-independence consists grouping together integrals proportional (1 + ) (1 + )2, without solving explicitly. that, make use on-shell conditions make momentum redenitions order check overall expression vanishes. so, expand, arbitrary , (q) = t0(q) + (1 + )t1(q) + (1 + )2t2(q) , (20) write, using previous expressions diagrams, t1 t2 follows: t1(q) = 8z d4k (2)4 1 k2(k q)2 2z d4k (2)4 (p1 + p3 (k q))(k q) k2(k q)4 9 (p1 + p3 k)k k4(k q)2 (p2 + p4 + k)k + 2z d4k (2)4 (p2 + p4 + (k q))(k q) k2(k q)4 2z + 2z + z + z + z + z d4k (2)4 d4k (2)4 d4k (2)4 d4k (2)4 d4k (2)4 d4k (2)4 k4(k q)2 (p1 + p3 (k q))(p2 + p4 + (k q)) k2(k q)4 (p1 + p3 k)(p2 + p4 + k) k4(k q)2 (p1 + p3 (k q))((k q) p2 p4) k2(k q)4 (p1 + p3 k)(k p2 p4) k4(k q)2 . (21) analyzing expressions, possible eliminate integrals form z (p1 + p3) k kn(k q)m z (p2 + p4) k kn(k q)m , sum depend linearly q. one readily see (p1 + p3) q = 0 (p2 + p4) q = 0, q = p1 p3 = p4 p2. argument may applied similar terms, like (p2 + p4) (k q) , shift momentum, k k + q , arrive situation before. finally, left vanishing expression: t1(q) = e4(1 + ) z d4k (2)4 1 k2(k q)2 (4 + 8 4) = 0 . (22) now, considering part proportional (1 + )2, collecting integrals have: t2(q) = 4z 2z z z d4k (2)4 d4k (2)4 d4k (2)4 d4k (2)4 2 k4(k q)4 + 2z (p2 + p4 + k)(k q) k(k q) d4k (2)4 k4(k q)4 (p1 + p3 k)(k q) k(k q) k4(k q)4 (p2 + p4 + k)(k q) (p1 + p3 k)(k q) (k p2 p4)(k q)(p1 + p3 k)(k q) k4(k q)4 k4(k q)4 using exactly procedure before, following vanishing result follows: t2(q) = e4(1 + )2z d4k (2)4 2 k4(k q)4 (2 4 + 2) = 0 see, possible demonstrate complete cancellations gauge-xing dependence denition potential. necessary solve dimensional 10 (23) (24) regularization integrals explicitly, search convenient simplication using on-shell conditions external legs. relatively easy way canceling non-physical contribu- tions potential obvious treating problem quantum gravity, indeed major concern. believe cancellations sqed are, anyway, good sign gravity counterpart. least, possible set denition potential non-relativistic limit scattering amplitude 1 particle-irreducible graphs, method treating non-analytic pieces consistent (expected) gauge-independence. also, cancellation gauge-dependent integrals coming various diagrams conrms set diagrams complete none lost. 5 calculation physical potential grouping remaining part scattering amplitudes order extract quantum corrections classical coulomb potential, have: t0(q) = 8e4z d4k (2)4 1 k2(k q)2 2z d4k (2)4 (p1 + p3 k + q)) (p1 + p3 k) k2(k q)2 2e4z d4k (2)4 (p2 + p4 + k q)(p2 + p4 + k) k2(k q)2 + +e4z d4k (2)4 (p2 + p4 + k)(p1 + p3 k)(p2 + p4 + k q) (p1 + p3 k + q) k2(k q)2 + + e4z d4k (2)4 (k p2 p4)(p1 + p3 k)(k q p2 p4)) (p1 + p3 k + q) k2(k q)2 .
