abstract

by using the fact that polychronakos-like models can be obtained through the

freezing limit of related spin calogero models, we calculate the exact spectrum as

well as partition function of su(m|n) supersymmetric polychronakos (sp) model. it

turns out that, similar to the non-supersymmetric case, the spectrum of su(m|n) sp

model is also equally spaced. however, the degeneracy factors of corresponding energy

levels crucially depend on the values of bosonic degrees of freedom (m) and fermionic

degrees of freedom (n). as a result, the partition functions of sp models are expressed

through some novel q-polynomials. finally, by interchanging the bosonic and fermionic

degrees of freedom, we obtain a duality relation among the partition functions of sp

models.

1 introduction

integrable one-dimensional models with long ranged interactions have recently at-

tracted a lot of interest due to their close connection with diverse subjects like fractional

statistics, random matrix theory, level statistics for disordered systems, yangian alge-

bra, q-polynomials etc.

[1-20]. the su(m) polychronakos spin chain [6-8] is a well

known example of such integrable models with the hamiltonian given by

hp = x1i<jn

(1  pij)
(xi  xj)2 ,

(1.1)

where  = 1(1) represents the ferromagnetic (anti-ferromagnetic) case and pij is the

exchange operator interchanging the spins (taking m possible values) of i-th and j-

th lattice sites. moreover the positions of corresponding lattice sites (xi), which are

inhomogeneously distributed on a line, are given by the zero points of the n-th order

hermite polynomial and may also be obtained as a solution of the following set of

equations:

xi = xk6=i

2

(xi  xk)3 ,

(1.2)

where i  [1, 2,    , n]. though the polychronakos spin chain (1.1) does not enjoy

translational invariance, one can nd out its exact spectrum as well as partition function

by considering the freezing limit of the calogero hamiltonian which possesses both

spin and particle degrees of freedom [8]:

hc =

1
2

n

xi=1   

2
x2
i

+ 2x2

i ! + x1i<jn

l (l  pij)
(xi  xj)2 ,

(1.3)

 and l being some positive coupling constants. thus, it is revealed that the hamilto-

nian (1.1) generates an equidistant spectrum, where the energy levels are highly degen-

erate in general. such high degeneracy of energy levels can be explained through the

motif picture originating from the y (glm ) yangian symmetry of the polychronakos

spin chain (1.1) and calogero model (1.3) [13,21]. moreover, the partition function of

the hamiltonian (1.1) is found to be closely related [13,22] to the su(m) rogers-szego

(rs) polynomial, which have appeared earlier in dierent contexts like the theory of

partitions [23] and the character formula for the heisenberg xxx spin chain [24].

2

now, for the purpose of obtaining a supersymmetric extension of the polychronakos
spin chain, we consider a set of operators like ci (ci), which creates (annihilates) a

particle of species  on the i-th lattice site. such creation (annihilation) operators are

dened to be bosonic if   [1, 2,    , m] and fermionic if   [m + 1, m + 2,    , m + n]

(where, according to our notation, m + n = m). next, we focus our attention only to

a subspace of the related fock space, for which the total number of particles per site

is always one:

m

cici = 1 ,

(1.4)

x=1

for all i. on the above mentioned subspace, one can dene a supersymmetric exchange

operator as [18]

p (m|n)

ij

=

m

x,=1

cicjcicj ,

(1.5)

and show that this p (m|n)

ij

yields a realisation of the permutation algebra given by

p 2

ij = 1, pijpjl = pilpij = pjlpil ,

[pij, plm] = 0 ,

(1.6)

(i, j, l, m being all distinct). this supersymmetric exchange operator (1.5) was used

earlier for constructing the su(m|n) supersymmetric haldane-shastry (hs) model [18].

so, in analogy with the case of supersymmetric hs model, we may use the exchange

operator (1.5) for constructing a hamiltonian of the form

h(m|n)

p

= x1i<jn

(cid:16) 1  p (m|n)
(xi  xj)2

ij

(cid:17)

.

(1.7)

it should be noted that, at the special case m = m, n = 0, i.e. when all degrees of
freedom are bosonic, p (m|n)

(1.5) becomes equivalent to the spin exchange operator

ij

pij which appears in the hamiltonian (1.1). therefore, at this pure bosonic case,

(1.7) would reproduce the ferromagnetic polychronakos spin chain (1.1) where  = 1.

similarly, for the case m = 0, n = m, i.e. , when all degrees of freedom are fermionic,

(1.7) would reproduce the anti-ferromagnetic polychronakos spin chain (1.1) where

 = 1. so, when both bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom are involved (i.e.,
when both m and n take nonzero values), we may say that h(m|n)

(1.7) represents the

p

hamiltonian of su(m|n) supersymmetric polychronakos (sp) model.

3

in this article, our aim is to study the spectrum and partition function of the

above dened su(m|n) sp model. to this end, in sec.2, we introduce an appropriate

extension of spin calogero model (1.3), which would generate the sp model (1.7) at

the freezing limit.

in this section, we also demonstrate that the spectrum of such

extended spin calogero model is essentially the same with the spectrum of decoupled

su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic oscillators, where each oscillator has m bosonic as

well as n fermionic spin degrees of freedom. in this way we are able to show that, the

equidistant spectrum of su(m|n) sp model (1.7) can be obtained by simply modding

out the spectrum of su(m|n) harmonic oscillators through the spectrum of spinless

bosonic harmonic oscillators. subsequently, in sec.3, we derive the partition function of

sp model (1.7) and interestingly observe that such partition functions can be expressed

through some novel q-polynomials. finally, we obtain a duality relation between the

partition functions of su(m|n) and su(n|m) sp models. sec.4 is the concluding

section.

2

spectra of su (m|n) sp model and related spin
calogero model

for obtaining the spectrum of sp model, we wish to follow here the approach of ref.8

and nd out at rst a suitable extension of spin calogero model (1.3), which would

reproduce the sp model (1.7) at the freezing limit. however, one immediate problem

which arises at present is that a spin calogero model like (1.3) is a rst quantised

system, while the sp model (1.7) is a second quantised system. so, for applying the

above mentioned approach, it is convenient to transform the second quantised sp model

(1.7) to a rst quantised spin system.

to this end, we now consider some special cases of anyon like representations of

permutation algebra (1.6), which were used earlier for constructing integrable exten-

sions of su(m) calogero-sutherland model as well as hs spin chain [25-28]. such

4

special cases of anyon like representations are dened by their action on a spin state

like |12    n i (with i  [1, 2,    , m] ) as

p (m|n)

ij

|12    i    j    n i = ei(m|n)(i,i+1,,j) |12    j    i    n i ,

(2.1)

where (m|n)(i, i+1,    , j) = 0 if i, j  [1, 2,    , m], (m|n)(i, i+1,    , j) =

 if i, j  [m+1, m+2,    , m+n], and (m|n)(i, i+1,    , j) =  pm+n

 =m+1pj1

p=i+1

,p if i  [1, 2,    , m] and j  [m + 1, m + 2,    , m + n] or vice versa. it is clear
that p (m|0)

reproduces the original spin exchange operator pij and p (0|m )

reproduces

ij

ij

pij. next we notice that, due to the constraint (1.4), the hilbert space associated

with sp hamiltonian (1.7) can be spanned through the following orthonormal basis
vectors: c11c22    cn n |0i, where |0i is the vacuum state and i  [1, 2,    , m].
so, it is possible to dene a one-to-one correspondence between the state vectors of the

above mentioned hilbert space and the state vectors associated with a spin chain as

|12    n i  c11c22    cn n |0i .

(2.2)

however it should be noted that, the matrix elements of p (m|n)

ij

(2.1) and p (m|n)

ij

(1.5)

are related as [28]

h12    n | pij|12    n i = h0|cn 

n

cn1,

n1

   c1

p (m|n)

ij

c11c22    cn n |0i,
(2.3)

where is and is may be chosen in all possible ways. thus one nds that, the anyon

like representation (2.1) is in fact equivalent to the supersymmetric realisation (1.5).

consequently, the rst quantised spin hamiltonian given by

h (m|n)

p

= x1i<jn

(cid:16) 1  p (m|n)
(xi  xj)2

ij

(cid:17)

,

(2.4)

would also be completely equivalent to the second quantised sp model (1.7). in par-

ticular, the hamiltonians (1.7) and (2.4) would share the same spectrum and their

eigenfunctions can be related through the correspondence (2.2).

next, we dene a spin calogero model as

(cid:17)

,

(2.5)

5

where p (m|n)

ij

is the anyon like representation (2.1). at the special case m = m, n = 0

(m = 0, n = m), the above hamiltonian reproduces the su(m) spin calogero model

(1.3) with  = 1 ( = 1). notice that the hamiltonian (2.5) can be rewritten as

h (m|n)

c

= h0 + l h (m|n)

1

,

where h0 is the hamiltonian for spinless calogero model:

h0 =

xi=1

x2
i

+ 2x2

i ! + x1i<jn

l (l  1)
(xi  xj)2 ,

(2.6)

(2.7)

1

is obtained from h (m|n)

and h (m|n)
tively. thus, the operator h (m|n)

p

(2.4) by replacing xi and xj with xi and xj respec-

1

possesses both spin and particle degrees of freedom.

however, in analogy with the case of usual spin calogero model (1.3) [8], we may now

consider the freezing limit of extended spin calogero model (2.5). such freezing limit

is obtained by setting l =  in the hamiltonian (2.5) and nally taking its   

limit. it is evident that, at this freezing limit, particle and spin degrees of freedom of
hamiltonian (2.5) would decouple and the operator h (m|n)

would be transformed to a

1

pure spin hamiltonian where the xed values of xis are determined through the minima

of potential energy associated with spinless calogero hamiltonian (2.7). since the solu-
tion of eqn.(1.2) leads to the minima of such potential energy, the operator h (m|n)

will

1

exactly reproduce the sp hamiltonian (2.4) at the freezing limit. consequently, the

eigenfunctions of spin calogero model (2.5) will factorise into eigenfunctions of spin-

less calogero model (2.7) containing only particle degrees of freedom and su(m|n) sp

model (2.4) containing only spin degrees of freedom. moreover, at this freezing limit,

the energy eigenvalues (denoted by ep,s(), where the subscripts p and s represent

the particle and spin degrees of freedom respectively) of the full system (2.5) can be

expressed as

ep,s() = ep() +  es ,

(2.8)

where ep() and es denote the energy eigenvalues of spinless calogero model (2.7)

and sp spin chain (2.4) respectively.

it is clear from eqn.(2.8) that, by modding out the spectrum of spin calogero

model (2.5) through the spectrum of spinless calogero model (2.7), one can construct

6

the spectrum of sp model (2.4) or (1.7). so, for the purpose of obtaining the spectrum

of sp model, it is essential to nd out at rst the spectrum of spin calogero model

(2.5). to this end, we consider the spinless calogero model of distinguishable particles,

which is described by a hamiltonian of the form

h0 =

1
2

n

xi=1   

2
x2
i

+ 2x2

i ! + x1i<jn

l (l  kij)
(xi  xj)2 ,

(2.9)

where kij is the coordinate exchange operator: kij(   , xi,    , xj,   ) =

(   , xj,    , xi,   ). by restricting the action of the above hamiltonian on com-

pletely symmetric wave functions, we may recover the spinless calogero model (2.7)

of indistinguishable particles.

it has been recently found that, by using some simi-

larity transformations, one can completely decouple all particle degrees of freedom of

calogero hamiltonians (2.7) as well as (2.9) [29-33]. such similarity transformations

naturally lead to a very ecient method of calculating the eigenfunctions of spinless

calogero models. in particular, the spectrum and eigenfunctions of h0 (2.9) can be

obtained through a similarity transformation which maps this interacting hamiltonian

to a system of decoupled harmonic oscillators like

hf ree = 

akak ,

n

xk=1

(2.10)

where ak = 12 (cid:16)xk  

xk(cid:17) and ak = 12 (cid:16)xk + 

xk(cid:17). the above mentioned simi-

larity transformation is explicitly given by [32,33]

s1 ( h0  eg ) s = hf ree ,

where eg = 1

the operator ol is called the lassalle operator. as is well known, the eigenfunc-

tions of decoupled oscillators (2.10) can be written in the form:

|n1n2    nn i =

|0i, where |0i is the corresponding vacuum state. the coordinate rep-

hnj (xj) ,

(2.13)

where hnj (xj) is the hermite polynomial of order nj. it should be noted that, the above

eigenfunctions do not generally obey any symmetry property under the exchange of

coordinates and, therefore, they are free from any statistics. due to the similarity trans-

formation (2.11), the eigenfunctions of spinless calogero model (2.9) may be obtained

through the eigenfunctions (2.13) of free oscillators as

n1,n2,,nn (x1, x2,    , xn ) = s 
 e 1

2 x2

n

yj=1

hnj (xj)
 ,

(2.14)

j=1 nj representing the corresponding eigenvalues. so, apart

with e{ni} = eg + pn

from a constant energy shift (eg) for all levels, the spectrum of spinless calogero model

(2.9) is exactly the same as the spectrum of decoupled hamiltonian (2.10) containing

distinguishable particles [32,33]. a comment might be in order. the exponentiation of
the lassalle operator e 1

4 ol yields essential singularities at xi = xj, i, j = 1, 2,    , n,

when it operates on general multivariable functions. however, such essential singular-

ities are not generated when the exponentiation of the lassalle operator operates on

multivariable polynomials. our using of the lassalle operator in the expression (2.14)

is such a safe one. details on the property of the lassalle operators are given in refs.

32, 33.

in the following, we want to show that the eigenfunctions of spin calogero model

(2.5) can also be obtained through the eigenfunctions of decoupled harmonic oscillators,

provided they possess nondynamical spin degrees of freedom and obey some denite
statistics. to this end, we introduce a projection operator (m|n)

which satises the

n

relations like

kij p (m|n)

(2.15)

where i, j  [1, 2,    , n]. such a projector can be formally written through transpo-
sition operator  (m|n)

where the series of transposition  (m|n)

    (m|n)

ipjp

represents an element of the per-

mutation group (pn ) associated with n objects and, due to the summations on p

and {ik, jk}, each element of pn would appear only once in the r.h.s. of the above
equation. for example, (m|n)
(m|n)
that at the special case m = m, n = 0 (m = 0, n = m), the projector (m|n)

are given by: (m|n)
 (m|n)

 (m|n)
23

and (m|n)
13 +  (m|n)

. it should be noted

12 +  (m|n)

completely symmetrises (antisymmetrises) any wave function under simultaneous in-

terchange of particle as well as spin degrees of freedom, and thus projects the wave

function to bosonic (fermionic) subspace. next, we multiply the eigenfunction (2.14) of

calogero hamiltonian (2.9) by an arbitrary spin state |12    n i and subsequently

apply the projector (2.16) for obtaining a wave function like

where x  x1, x2,    , xn and   1, 2,    , n . since the operator h0 (2.9) commutes
with kij as well as (m|n)

(2.16), the expression (2.17) again gives an eigenfunction

n

of the calogero hamiltonian (2.9), where each particle possesses some nondynamical

spin degrees of freedom. consequently, with the help of relation (2.15) which allows
one to replace kij by p (m|n)

, one can show that 1, 2,, n

eigenfunction of spin calogero model (2.5) with eigenvalue e{ni},{i} = eg +pn

calogero model (2.5) through the known eigenfunctions of decoupled harmonic oscil-

lators (2.10). however it is important to notice that, due to the existence of projector
(m|n)

in eqn.(2.17), a denite correlation is now imposed among the eigenfunctions

n

of decoupled harmonic oscillators. to demonstrate this point in an explicit way, we

9

observe rst that the operator s (2.12) commutes with kij and the projector (m|n)

n

(2.16). by using such commutation relations, eqn.(2.17) can be rewritten as

n1, n2,, nn (x; ) = s 1, 2,, n

n1, n2,, nn (x; ) ,

(2.18)

mentioned correlation, we use the relation (2.15) and replace (m|n)

in the r.h.s. of eqn.(2.19). finally, by acting p (m|n)
on |12    n i and kij on
e 1

j=1 hnj (xj) , we nd that the eigenfunction (2.19) of free oscillators must

by (m|n)

satisfy the following symmetry condition under simultaneous interchange of related

qn

particle and spin quantum numbers:

n1,, ni,, nj ,, nn (x; ) = ei(m|n)(i,i+1,,j ) 1,, j ,, i,, n
1,, i,, j ,, n

n1,, nj ,, ni,, nn (x; ) ,

(2.20)

(m|n)(i, i+1,    , j) being the same phase factor which appeared in eqn.(2.1).

it

is clear from eqn.(2.20) that, for the case i, j  [1, 2,    , m], the eigenfunction
1,, i,, j ,, n

n1,, ni,, nj ,, nn (x; ) remains completely unchanged under simultaneous interchange
of particle and spin quantum numbers. thus i may be treated as a bosonic quantum

number, if it takes any value ranging from 1 to m. next, by using eqn.(2.20) for the
case i, j  [m + 1, m + 2,    , m + n], it is easy to see that 1,, i,, j ,, n

n1,, ni,, nj ,, nn (x; )
would pick up a minus sign under simultaneous interchange of particle and spin quan-
tum numbers. therefore, the eigenfunction 1,, i,, j ,, n

n1,, ni,, nj ,, nn (x; ) must be trivial if
we choose ni = nj and i = j  [m + 1, m + 2,    , m + n]. thus i may be treated

as a fermionic quantum number, if it takes any value ranging from m + 1 to m + n.

notice that if we simultaneously interchange a bosonic quantum number i with

a fermionic quantum number j and ni with nj, then the eigenfunctions satisfying

10

transformation relation (2.20) would either remain invariant or pick up a minus sign

depending on whether even or odd number of fermionic spin quantum numbers are

present in the conguration: i+1i+2    j1. it is obvious that, at the special case
m = m, n = 0 (m = 0, n = m), 1, 2,, n
n1, n2,, nn (x; ) (2.19) represents completely sym-
metric (antisymmetric) eigenfunctions of su(m) bosonic (fermionic) oscillators. so,

for the case m, n 6= 0, we may say that the correlated state vectors (2.19) would repre-

sent the eigenfunctions of n number of su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic oscillators.

due to the existence of symmetry condition (2.20), we nd that all independent

eigenfunctions of su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic oscillators can be obtained uniquely

through the following occupation number representation. since, at present, spins be-

have as nondynamical degrees of freedom, all single particle states for this occupation

number representation may be constructed by taking m+n copies of each energy eigen-

state associated with a spinless harmonic oscillator  the rst m copies being bosonic

in nature and last n copies being fermionic in nature. as usual, any bosonic single par-

ticle state can be occupied with arbitrary number of particles and any fermionic single

particle state can hold at most one particle. by lling up such bosonic and fermionic

single particle states through n number of particles, we can easily identify all inde-

pendent eigenfunctions of the form (2.19). so, this occupation number representation

of states (2.19) gives us a very convenient way of analysing the spectrum of su(m|n)

supersymmetric harmonic oscillators. in particular we may verify that, similar to pure

bosonic or fermionic case, the spectrum of su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic oscil-

lators is also equally spaced. but, it is interesting to note further that, the ground

state energy of su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic oscillators coincides with that of

the pure bosonic case, instead of pure fermionic case. since m number of fermionic sin-

gle particle states with zero energy can hold at most m number of particles, a nonzero

ground state energy is obtained for a pure fermionic system when n > m. however,

if at least one bosonic single particle state with zero energy is available, we can ll up

that state through all available particles. consequently we nd that, irrespective of

the values of m and n, the ground state energy of su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic

11

oscillators would always be zero. moreover, by using the above mentioned occupation

number representation, we obtain the degeneracy (dg) of ground state for su(m|n)

supersymmetric harmonic oscillators as

dg =

n

xk=0

(n + m  k  1)! n!

(n  k)! (m  1)! k! (n  k)!

.

(2.21)

it is worth observing that this degeneracy factor crucially depends on the values of

m and n, and reproduces the degeneracy of the ground state for su(m) bosonic

oscillators [8] at the special case m = m, n = 0. similarly, one can demonstrate

that the degeneracy of higher energy levels, appearing in the spectrum of su(m|n)

supersymmetric harmonic oscillators, would also depend on the values of m and n.

due to the relation (2.18), where s acts as a nonsingular operator, there exists a

one-to-one correspondence between the independent eigenfunctions of spin calogero

model (2.5) and su(m|n) supersymmetric oscillators. consequently, up to a constant

energy shift (eg) for all energy levels, the spectrum of spin calogero model (2.5) ex-

actly coincides with the spectrum of su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic oscillators.

however it is well known that, up to the same constant energy shift for all energy

levels, the spectrum of spinless calogero model (2.7) exactly coincides with the spec-

trum of n number of spinless bosonic harmonic oscillators. as the eigenvalues of both

su(m|n) supersymmetric oscillators and spinless bosonic oscillators depend linearly

on the coupling constant , it is clear that eqn.(2.8) can be used even for any nite

value of  (though the eigenfunctions of spin calogero model (2.5) will factorise only

at the freezing limit). moreover, since the spectra of both su(m|n) supersymmetric

oscillators and spinless bosonic oscillators are equally spaced, it automatically follows

from eqn.(2.8) that the spectrum of su(m|n) sp model (1.7) would also be equally

spaced for any choice of m and n. but it is natural to expect that, similar to the case

of su(m|n) supersymmetric oscillators, the degeneracy of energy levels for su(m|n)

sp model (1.7) would crucially depend on the values of m and n. so, it should be

interesting to derive the partition function of sp model (1.7), where all information

about these degeneracy factors is encoded.

3 partition function of su (m|n) sp model

in the previous section we have observed that, similar to the pure bosonic case, the

ground state energy of su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic oscillators would always be

zero. so, in analogy with this pure bosonic (i.e., ferromagnetic) case [8], we may now

put  = 1 in eqn.(2.8) and subsequently use this equation to obtain a relation like

z (m|n)

n

(q) =

z (m|n)
(q)
n
z (1|0)
n (q)

,

(3.1)

(q) and z (m|n)

n

(q) denote the canonical partition functions of

where q = e 1

kt , z (m|n)

n

su(m|n) sp model (1.7) and su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic oscillators (where
 = 1) respectively. due to the above mentioned notations, z (1|0)

n (q) and z (0|1)

n (q)

denote the canonical partition functions of n number of spinless bosonic and fermionic

harmonic oscillators respectively. it is well known that, the partition functions of such

spinless bosonic and fermionic oscillators are given by [8]

z (1|0)

n (q) =

1

(q)n

,

z (0|1)

n (q) = q

n(n1)

2

1

(q)n

,

(3.2)

where the standard notation: (q)n = (1  q)(1  q2)    (1  qn ) (and (q)0 = 1) is used.
so, for calculating z (m|n)

(q) with the help of eqn.(3.1), we have to nd out only the

n

partition function of n number of su(m|n) supersymmetric oscillators.

to this end, however, we consider at rst the grand canonical partition function of

su(m|n) supersymmetric oscillators. such grand canonical partition function may be
denoted by z (m|n)(q, y), where y = e and  is the chemical potential of the system.
so, according to our notation, z (1|0)(q, y) and z (0|1)(q, y) denote the grand canonical

partition functions of spinless bosonic and fermionic harmonic oscillators respectively.

as usual, the grand canonical partition function of su(m|n) supersymmetric oscillators

can be related to the corresponding partition function through the following power

series expansion in variable y:

yn z (m|n)

n

(q)

(3.3)

z (m|n)(q, y) =



xn =0

13

where it is assumed that z (m|n)

0

(q) = 1. in the previous section we have found that,

all independent eigenfunctions of su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic oscillators can

be obtained through an occupation number representation, where the corresponding

single particle states are constructed by taking m + n copies of each energy eigenstate

associated with a spinless harmonic oscillator  the rst m copies being bosonic in

nature and last n copies being fermionic in nature. by exploiting this result, it is

easy to prove that the grand canonical partition function of su(m|n) supersymmetric

oscillators can be expressed through those of spinless bosonic and fermionic oscillators

as

z (m|n)(q, y) = h z (1|0)(q, y)imh z (0|1)(q, y)in

.

(3.4)

next, we substitute the power series expansion (3.3) to the place of all grand canonical

partition functions appearing in the above equation. subsequently, we compare the

coecients of yn from both sides of eqn.(3.4), and readily nd that the canonical

partition function of su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic oscillators may also be related

to those of spinless bosonic and fermionic oscillators:

z (m|n)

n

(q) =

x
ai+pn

j=1

i=1

pm

z (1|0)

ai

(q)

m

yi=1

n

yj=1

bj =n

z (0|1)

bj

(q) ,

(3.5)

where ais and bjs are some nonnegative integers. by substituting the known partition

functions (3.2) of spinless bosonic and fermionic oscillators to the above equation, one

may now obtain an explicit expression for the partition function of su(m|n) super-

symmetric oscillators as

z (m|n)

n

(q) =

x
ai+pn

i=1

pm

bj =n

j=1

bj (bj 1)

2

j=1

qpn

(q)a1(q)a2    (q)am  (q)b1(q)b2    (q)bn

.

(3.6)

finally, by using eqns.(3.1), (3.2) and (3.6), we derive the exact canonical partition

function of su(m|n) sp model (1.7) as

z (m|n)

n

(q) =

x
ai+pn

j=1

i=1

pm

bj =n

bj (bj 1)

2

j=1

(q)n  qpn

(q)a1(q)a2    (q)am  (q)b1(q)b2    (q)bn

.

(3.7)

since, there exists an upper bound on the highest energy eigenvalue of sp model (1.7),
the partition function z (m|n)

(q) (3.7) evidently yields some new q-polynomials which

n

are characterised by the values of m and n. the coecients of various powers of

q, appearing in such novel q-polynomial, would represent the degeneracy factors of

corresponding energy levels associated with sp model (1.7). it is interesting to note

that, by putting m = m, n = 0 to the expression (3.7), one can exactly reproduce the

partition function of ferromagnetic polychronakos spin chain [8]. on the other hand,

for the limiting case m = 0, n = m, eqn.(3.7) would reproduce the partition function

of anti-ferromagnetic polychronakos spin chain up to a constant (i.e., q independent)

multiplicative factor. this is because, in pure fermionic case, a system of harmonic

oscillators with m spin degrees of freedom gives some nonzero ground state energy when

n > m. so, eqn.(3.1) must be modied through a constant multiplicative factor for

taking into account such nonzero ground state energy [8]. consequently the expression

(3.7) for partition function, which we have derived for the supersymmetric case (i.e.,

when both m and n are nonzero), should also be modied by the same constant factor

at the pure fermionic limit.

with the help of a relation: (q1)l = (1)l q l(l+1)

2

(q)l, we nd that the partition

function (3.7) of sp model satises a remarkable duality condition given by

z (m|n)

n

(q) = q

n(n1)

2 z (n|m)

n

(q1) ,

(3.8)

where m and n may be chosen as any nonzero integer. due to this duality condition,

one can write down a relation of the form

d(m|n)

n

(e) = d(n|m)

n

  n(n  1)

2

 e! ,

(3.9)

where d(m|n)

n

(e) denotes the degeneracy factor associated with energy eigenvalue e of

su(m|n) sp model. moreover, by using the duality condition (3.8), along with the

fact that the ground state energy of hamiltonian (1.7) is zero, it is easy to show that

emax =

n(n  1)

2

15

(3.10)

represents the highest energy eigenvalue of the su(m|n) sp model. in this context one

may notice that, the highest energy eigenvalue of ferromagnetic or anti-ferromagnetic

su(m) polychronakos spin chain (1.1) is given by [8]

emax =

m  1

2m

n 2 

t(m  t)

2m

,

(3.11)

where t = n mod m. thus we curiously nd that, in contrast to the case of su(m)

polychronakos spin chain (1.1), the highest energy eigenvalue of su(m|n) sp model

(1.7) does not depend at all on the values of m or n.

for obtaining some insight about the above mentioned dierence between the high-

est energy eigenvalues (3.10) and (3.11), we nally consider the motif picture, which

was used to analyse the degeneracy of eigenfunctions for su(m) hs as well as poly-

chronakos spin chain through the corresponding symmetry algebra [11,13]. as is well

known, motifs of these spin chains are made of binary digits like 0 and 1. moreover,

for a spin chain with n number of lattice sites, these binary digits would form motifs

of length n  1. so we can write a motif as (a1a2    an1), where ai  [0, 1] and each
motif represents a class of degenerate eigenfunctions which yield an irreducible repre-

sentation of y (glm ) yangian algebra [11,18]. for the case of su(m) polychronakos

spin chain, the energy eigenvalue corresponding to (a1a2    an1) motif is given by [13]

e(a1a2an1) =

n1

xr=1

r ar .

(3.12)

however, for the case of su(m) polychronakos and hs spin chain, there exists a

selection rule which forbids the occurrence of m number of consecutive 1s in any

motif. by combining this selection rule along with eqn.(3.12), one can derive the

highest energy eigenvalue (3.11) of su(m) polychronakos model and also understand

why this eigenvalue crucially depends on the value of m. it is worth noting that, the

above mentioned motif picture can also be used to analyse the spectrum of su(m|n)

supersymmetric hs spin chain [18,28]. but, for this supersymmetric case, there exists

no selection rule and binary digits like 0 and 1 can be chosen freely for constructing a

motif of length n 1. being motivated by the case of supersymmetric hs spin chain, we

16

may now conjecture that the motifs corresponding to sp model (1.7) are also free from

any selection rule and eqn.(3.12) again gives the corresponding energy eigenvalues.

so, the spectrum of su(m|n) sp model contains 2n1 number of motifs, which can

be constructed by lling up n  1 positions with 0 or 1 in all possible ways. by

using eqn.(3.12), it is easy to check that the motif (11    1) yields the highest energy

eigenvalue (3.10). thus the absence of any selection rule, for the motifs corresponding

to sp model, turns out to be the main reason behind the remarkably simple expression

(3.10).

4 concluding remarks

in this paper we have investigated the spectrum as well as partition function of su(m|n)

supersymmetric polychronakos (sp) model (1.7) and the related spin calogero model

(2.5). the similarity transformation (2.11), which maps the spinless calogero model

of distinguishable particles to decoupled oscillators, and the projection operator (2.16)

have played a key role in our derivation for the spectrum of spin calogero model (2.5).

thus we have found that, up to a constant energy shift for all states, the spectrum of

this spin calogero model is exactly the same with the spectrum of decoupled su(m|n)

supersymmetric harmonic oscillators. furthermore, by using the occupation number

representation associated with su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic oscillators, we have

obtained the exact partition function for this spin calogero model.

it turned out that, the above mentioned spin calogero model reproduces the sp

model (1.7) at the freezing limit. consequently, by factoring out the contributions

due to dynamical degrees of freedom from the spectrum as well as partition function

of spin calogero model (2.5), one can compute the spectrum and partition function for

su(m|n) sp model. by following this procedure we have found that, similar to the

non-supersymmetric case, the spectrum of su(m|n) sp model is also equally spaced.

however, the degeneracy factors of corresponding energy levels crucially depend on the

17

values of m and n. as a result, we get some novel q-polynomials which represent the

partition functions of sp models. moreover, by interchanging the bosonic and fermionic

degrees of freedom, we obtain a duality relation among the partition functions of sp

models.

as a future study, it should be interesting to nd out the lax operators and con-

served quantities for the su(m|n) sp model (1.7). moreover, in parallel to the case

of su(m|n) haldane-shastry model [18], one might be able to show that the su(m|n)

sp model also exhibits the y (gl(m|n)) super-yangian symmetry. such super-yangian
symmetry of sp model may turn out to be very helpful in analysing the degeneracy

patterns for its spectrum. however, information about these degeneracy patterns is

also encoded in our expression of partition function (3.7). so, there should exist an

intriguing connection between the partition function (3.7) and the motif representa-

tions for super-yangian algebra. in particular, the partition function (3.7) might lead

to a supersymmetric generalisation of well-known rogers-szego (rs) polynomial. the

recursion relation among these supersymmetric rs polynomials may then be used to

nd out the motifs representations and degenerate multiplets associated with super-

yangian algebra. we hope to report about such supersymmetric rs polynomials and

related motifs in a forthcoming publication [34].
