(1) (2) (3) (4) interesting note dual f 1 2 f , completely antisymmetric levi-civita tensor 0123 = 1 indices raised lowered means , satisfy relations (4) unless vacuum einstein equations f = f = 0 satised . let us introduce gauge eld 3 = 1 2 (h h). note = a. using (3), nd transforms = , = . expression (5) allows write curvature tensor f f = . (5) (6) (7) thus, shown tensor f may written typical form abelian maxwell eld strength f = aa aa , index runs abelian group u(1) u(1) ... u(1). note f invariant transformation = exactly form transformation abelian gauge elds aa = a, arbitrary function coordinates x. 3.- linearized gravity la macdowell-mansouri central idea macdowell-mansouri theory  (see also refs. ) represent gravitational eld connection one-form associated group contains lorentz group subgroup. typical example provided so(3,2) anti-de sitter gauge theory gravity. case so(3,2) gravitational gauge eld ab = ba broken so(3,1) connection ab 4a = ea vierbein eld. thus, anti-de sitter curvature rab = ab ab + ac b c ac b c leads rab = rab + ab 4 (8) (9) r4a = ea ea + ac ec ac ec, rab = ab ab + ac b c ac b c so(3,1) curvature ab = ea eb ea eb . turns r4a identied torsion. macdowell-mansouris action = 1 4 z d4xrab rcd abcd, (10) (11) (12) (13) completely antisymmetric tensor associated space-time, 0123 = 1 0123 = 1, abcd also completely antisymmetric tensor associated internal group s(3,1), 0123 = 1. assume internal metric given (ab) = (1, 1, 1, 1). therefore, 0123 = 1. well known that, using (9), (11) (12), action (13) leads three terms; hilbert einstein action, cosmological constant term euler topological invariant (or gauss-bonnet term). worth mentioning action (13) may also obtained using lovelock theory (see  references in). let us apply macdowell-mansouri formalism linearized gravity developed section 2. first, consider extended curvature f = f + , = h h h + h . 5 (14) (15) central idea consider extended curvature (14) analogue curvature (9) macdowell-mansouri formalism. thus, may identify f linearized versions rab ab , respectively. fact, write ea = ba + la , ba corresponds metric la small deviation ea , nd h = ba lb ab + ba lb ab therefore using (5) get = (la )+f. here, (la ) = babbab (la ) f = bala bala . (it important note ab (la ) obtained setting torsion (10), weak gravity, equal zero.) thus, gauge transformation equal linearized connection ab (la ). essential dierence ab (la ) full connection ab latter associated lorentz group former abelian group. easily seen transformation = gauge eld , since general gauge eld transforms = + . let us propose action = 1 4 z d4xf f . (16) shall show action reduced einstein linearized gravitational action (fierz- pauli action ) cosmological constant total derivative (topological term). sub- stituting (14) (16) yields = 1 4 r d4x f f + 1 2 r d4x f using (15) nd (17) reduced + 1 4 r d4x . = 1 4 r d4x f f + 2r d4x h f (17) (18) +4r d4x h h . since = = 2 , general gener- alized delta, discover (18) written 6 = 1 4 r d4x f f + 8r d4xh(f 1 2 f ) (19) 8r d4x(h2 hh). here, used following denitions: f f, f f h = h. recognize second term third term (19) einstein action linearized gravity cosmological constant, rst term total derivative (an euler topo- logical invariant gauss-bonnet term). note usual cosmological factor third term derived simply changing a2, constant, rescaling total action 1 4 1s, = a2. 4.- s-duality linearized gravity order develope s-dual linearized gravitational action generalize action (16) follows; = 1 4 ( +)z d4x +f +f 1 4 ( )z d4x f f , + two dierent constant parameters f given f = ( 1 2 )m f , = 1 2 ( ). (20) (21) (22) turns +f self-dual, f anti self-dual curvature. therefore, action (20) describes self-dual anti-self-dual linearized gravity. may follow similar procedure references  abelian yang-mills  gravity. here, however, order show exactness s-duality symmetry linearized gravity, turns convenient follow procedure 7 reference  due witten. purpose let us rst introduce two form g let us set h f g . (23) assume g satises symmetric properties f , given (4), namely g = g = g = g , g + g + g = 0. now, consider extended action se = 1 4( +)r dx4 +h +h 1 4( )r dx4 h (24) (25) h + 1 2 r d4x +w +g 1 2 r d4x w g , w = v v dual eld strength satisfying dirac quatization law z w 2z. (26) dicult see that, beyond gauge invariance d, g g, partition function invariant z = z d+gdgdadhdv ese + b g g + db, (27) (28) b arbitrary one form. starting (25) one proceed two dierent ways. rst possibility, note path integral involves v z dv exp( 1 2 z d4x +w +g 8 1 2 z d4x w g ). (29) integrating dual connection v , get delta function setting dg = 0. thus, using gauge invariance (28), may gauge g zero, reducing (25) original action (20). therefore, actions (25) (20) are, fact, classically equivalents. second possibility, note gauge invariance (28) enables one x gauge = 0. (it important note that, stage, considering h independent elds sense palatini.) action (25) reduced se = 1 4( +)r dx4 +g + 1 2 r d4x +w +g 1 4( )r dx4 g g +g 1 2 r d4x w g , g g . virtue (31) extended action (30) becomes se = 1 4( +)r dx4 +g +g 1 4( )r dx4 g g 1 2 ( +)r dx4 + + 1 4( +)r dx4 + +g + 1 2( )r dx4 + 1 4( )r dx4 g (30) (31) (32) + 1 2 r d4x +w +g 1 2 r d4x w g . integrating h, let us consider identity = 4im (33) obtained denition (22). here, = . using identity denition (15) obtain 1 2 ( +)r d4x + +g + 1 2( )r d4x g (34) b = 1 2 r d4x 9 1 4 ( +)r d4x + + 1 4( )r d4x = b 4 r d4x , b = {( +)+g ( )g } b = 1 2 ( + ). using (34)-(37) learn action (32) written se = 1 4( +)r dx4 +g +g 1 4 ( )r dx4 g g + 1 2 r d4x b + b 4 r d4x (35) (36) (37) (38) + 1 2 r d4x +w +g 1 2 r d4x w g . note third fourth term (38) exactly form second third term (17). therefore, using denition (15) making similar calculations obtaining (19) get se = 1 4( +)r dx4 +g +g 1 4 ( )r dx4 g g +8r d4xh (b 1 2 b) 8br d4x(h2 hh) (39) + 1 2 r d4x +w +g 1 2 r d4x w g , b b, b b. note b plays role cosmological constant. integrate h reduced partition function 10 z = z d+gdgdhdv ese , se given (39). rst get relation b 1 2 b = 2b( h h). using expression action se given (39) becomes se = 1 4( +)r d4x +g +g 1 4 ( )r d4x g b r d4x( 1 + 2 3 b2 b b) (40) (41) (42) g + 1 2 r d4x +w +g 1 2 r d4x w g . perform integrals +g g still need rearrange third integral (42). purpose let us introduce denition b = c c. (43) note rst b = 3c. therefore, nd 1 3 b2 b b = c 2 c c. use identity 1 32 = (c 2 c c), = c c c + c (44) (45) observe according (36) write = ( +)+s + ( )s , +s = + + + + + = + . 11 (46) (47) here, = g 1 3 g c = ( +)+ + ( ) . but, due symmetry properties g given (24) discover =+ = . so, c = ( + ). thus, nd (42) written se = 1 4( +)r d4x +g +g 1 4 ( )r d4x g g 1 4( +)r d4x +s +s + 1 4 ( )r d4x (48) + 1 2 r d4x +w here, dened +g 1 2 r d4x w = + . g . (49) ready perform path integral (48) respect +g (similarly g ). get constraint ( +)+g ++ w + 1 4 ( +) = 0. (50) dicult see ( +)+g ++ w = 0 ( +)+g ++ w = 0. using two expressions nd ( +)+g ++ w 1 4 l = 0, = l + , (51) (52) = w 1 3 w . now, solving (51) +g substituting result (48) yields se = 1 4( 1 + )r d4x +w +w 1 4( 1 )r d4x w w (53) 1 4 ( 1 + )r d4x +l +l + 1 4( 1 )r d4x l l , 12 apply similar procedure g . but, action obtained following action: sd = 1 4( 1 + )r d4x +q +q 1 4 ( 1 )r d4x q q = w + k , k = + . q , (54) (55) (56) here, auxiliary eld. fact, integrating (54) respect get (53). action (54) is, course, dual action. note action (54) dual gauge invariance v v general type (20) 1 , either + . therefore, shown coupling transforms 1 one changes action (20) action (54). interesting note plays role dual perturbation metric. 5.-final comments article, shown possible construct s-dual action linearized gravity. two main ideas rewrite linearized gravity abelian gauge theory take recourse macdowell-mansouri formalism. analysis s-duality linearized gravity follows case abelian gauge theories. important step realization transformation (28) provides enough symmetry set = 0. long computations nally prove partition function linearized gravity s-dual symmetry za,h( ) = zv,( 1 ), 13 (57) za,h( ) partition function associated action (20), zv,( 1 ) partition function associated action (54). seems present work extended without essential complications case linearized supergravity. known, weak eld limit supergravity four dimensions reduces sum fierz-pauli rarita-schwinger actions, unique actions spin 2 3/2 without ghost (see  references in). means write partition function linearized supergravity product two partition functions: one corresponding linearized gravity correspond- ing rarita-schwinger eld. taking recourse self-dual antiself-dual supergravity considering separately self-dual-antiself-dual linearized gravity self-dual-antiself- dual rarita-shwinger, one nd linearized supergravity-s-dual symmetry . lin- earized gravity one may proceed previous sections, rarita-schwinger eld one may use method developed reference . way, one expect get s-dual linearized supergravity symmetry za,h,( ) = zv,,( 1 ), rarita- shwinger eld dual. present, investigating detail possibility expect report results near future. known s-duality gauge invariance matter great interest connection m-theory  supersymmetry  may interesting see whether present work useful directions. finally, worth mentioning physical meaning, well possible relevance, strong coupling limit linearized gravity. purpose, rst need clarify physical meaning coupling constants + . write action (16) = 1 16 z d4xf f . (58) mentioned end section 3, identied cosmological constant. now, using (22) dicult see action (20) reduced = 1 8 ( + )z d4xf f + 8 ( + + )z d4xf f . (59) 14 thus, consider expressions + = = 2 2 + , 1 4 1 4 nd action (59) written = 1 16 z d4xf f + 8 z d4xf f . recall case gauge theory + dened + = = 2 2 + 4 g2 , 4 g2 , (60) (61) (62) see cosmological constant playing role gauge coupling constant g2 playing role constant. gauge theory duality transformation 1 , either + , considered, simple form, duality gauge coupling constant g2 1 g2 , case linearized gravity (according (60)) considered duality cosmological constant 1 . duality 1 result seems suggest new mechanism make small cosmological constant, least linearized gravity (although similar conclusions must possible general cases references -). particular, mechanism discussed work may physical interest kaluza-klein theories process called spontaneous compactiction, normally, results large cosmological constant. acknowledgments work supported part conacyt grant 3898p-e9608. 15 references  e. witten, selecta matematica 1, (1995) 383; hep-th/9505186.  e. verlinde, nucl. phys. b 55, (1995) 211; hep-th/9506011.  j.l.p. barbon, nucl. phys. b 452, (1995) 313;hep-th/9506137.  y. lozano, phys. lett. b 364, (1995) 19; hep-th/9508021; a.a. kehagias, canonical approach s-duality abelian gauge theory; hep-th/9508159.  o. ganor j. sonnesnschein, int. j. mod. phys. 11, (1996) 5701; hep-th/9507036.  n. mohammedi, classical duality gauge theries, hep-th/9507040.  m.b. halpern, phys. rev. 16, (1977) 179; phys. rev. 19, (1979) 517.  e.s. fradkin a.s. tseytlin, ann. phys. 162, (1985) 21.  m. rocek e. verlinde, nucl. phys. b 373, (1992) 630; hep-th/9110053.  f. quevedo, nucl. phys. proc. suppl. 61a, (1998) 23; hep-th/9706210  h. garcia-compean, dual description supergravity macdowell-mansouri theory, appear phys. rev. d, hep-th/9812175.  j. a. nieto, o. obregon j. socorro, phys. rev. d50, (1994) r3583.  j. a. nieto, j. socorro o. obregon, phys. rev. lett. 76, (1996) 182.  h. garcia-compean, o. obregon, j. f. plebanski c. ramirez; phys. rev. d57 (1998) 7501; hep-th/9711115.  h. garcia-compean, o. obregon c. ramirez, phys. rev. d58 (1998) 104012; hep- th/9802063.  n. seiberg e. witten, nucl. phys. b426 (1994) 19.  n. seiberg e. witten, nucl. phys. b431 (1994) 484. 16  g. f. torres del castillo, self-duality gravitational perturbations, progress.  s. w. macdowell mansouri, phys. rev. lett. 38, (1977) 739.  f. mansouri, phys. rev. d16, (1977) 2456.  p. k. townsend, phys. rev. d15, (1977) 2795.  p. c. west, phys. lett. 76b, (1978) 569.  a. h. chamseddine, ann. phys.
