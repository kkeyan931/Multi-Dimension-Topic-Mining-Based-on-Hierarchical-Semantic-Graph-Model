abstract

solutions, exactly expressed in terms of elementary functions (unique laughlin states),
of the correlated motion problem for a pair of 2d-electrons in a constant and uniform
magnetic eld have been shown to exist for a certain relation between the magnetic eld
induction and the electron charge. arguments that can help to understand the physical
meaning of these remarkable magnetic eld values have been provided. the special interest
to this problem is justied by the importance of the new state of matter recently observed.

let us consider the motion of a pair of 2d-electrons in a constant and uniform magnetic
eld. in this problem, the motion of the electrons center of mass can be considered separately
from their relative motion.

the stationary schrodinger equation for the relative motion (the laughlin problem) has the

form

here m is the eective electron mass in the given heterostructure, e is the absolute value of
the electron charge, b is the magnetic eld induction. the symmetric gauge for the vector
potential in the above equation has been used

equation (1) formally corresponds to the schrodinger equation for a mass m/2 and charge
e/2 particle interacting with the uniform magnetic eld (2) and with a xed charge 2e
placed at the origin.
equation (1) is conveniently transformed to dimensionless variables. to this end, we
introduce the magnetic length lb = q2hc/ (eb) and the dimensionless energy eigenvalue

 = 2e/ (hc) , where c = eb/ (mc) is the cyclotron frequency. upon introduction of the
new dimensional variables

x = lb,

y = lb,

equation (1) takes the form

is the radial momentum operator, selfadjoint in the hilbert space l2 (0, , d) . it should be
mentioned that the term 1/ (42) has appeared in (9).

radial eigenfunctions are looked for in the form

r () = exp(cid:16)2/4(cid:17) f () .

the equation for the function f () reads

(11)

(12)

for magnetic elds of arbitrary strength (the parameter a takes arbitrary values), the regular
at the origin solution of equation (12), ensuring that r () belongs to the hilbert space, is given
by a series with a complicated and almost unknown structure.

it is only for some unique values of the magnetic eld that the functions f () are reduced

to polynomials [1]- [6], so that the radial functions r () take the form

rnk () = cnk exp(cid:16)2/4(cid:17) qnk () ,

where

qnk () =

bjj

nxj=0

(13)

(14)

is the order n polynomial with exactly k zeros (n and k are the principle and the radial quantum
numbers respectively) in the physical region (  0). the eigenvalues  for all the states of this
unique kind are given by the simple unied formula

 = n + 1,

n + 1, 2, ....

(15)

coecients of the polynomial qnk () are determined by the recurrence relations

b0 = 1,
b1 = 2,
bj = [a bj1 + (j  n  2) bj2] j 2.

the unique values of the magnetic elds are determined by the relations

(n + 1)2 bn+1 = abn  bn1 = 0.

several leading values of the parameter follow

a10 = 1,
a20 = 6,
a30 =q10 + 73, a31 =q10 
73,
a40 =q25 + 333, a41 =q25  333.

(18)

it is of interest to remark that the energy levels for the unique states (13) can be obtained
from the bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule, taking into consideration both the physical
(  0) and nonphysical ( < 0) ranges of the variable . in this case, the eective potential
energy should be put equal to (see (9))

uef f () =

(19)

the bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule with allowance for the above remarks can be put into
the form

dq  uef f () +

4z3

dq  uef f () = 2 (n + 1) .

(20)

the appearance of unity in the right-hand side of (20) is explained by the fact that there exist
four regular lower turning points, each of them contributing 1/4. it should be mentioned that,
when the term 1/ (42) is not included in expression (19), we have to assume that there is
an impenetrable potential wall at the point  = 0 with the contribution 1/2, instead of 1/4
[7]. integration in the left-hand side of equation (20) is easily performed with the help of the
residue technique (the integration contour is depicted in fig. 3b). as a result, we obtain exactly
formula (13) for , irrespective of a values.

the physical meaning of the particular magnetic eld values determined by relations (15)
in the following, we present considerations that may elucidate the

was unclear up to now.
physical origin of this phenomenon.

introduce the center of orbit operators [8]

cxc = bp +

2b,

byc = bp +

2b.

(21)

unlike [8], the symmetric gauge has been used here, and transformation to the dimensionless
form has been performed by means of the magnetic length introduced. then the operator of
the square of the distance between the center of the orbit and the origin can be written in the
form

 +

br2
c = bp2

 + bp2

4b2 + blz.

in the case of a pure magnetic eld, these operator commute with the hamiltonian, so that, in
a stationary state, the value of r2
c can be written in the
form

c is quite well dened. in our case r2

br2
c = ch  2blz 

a


.

(23)

due to the presence of the coulomb force, in our case, r2
state, and hence, only the quantum average of this physical quantity makes sense.

c is not conserved even in a stationary

introduce now the average value of the radius of orbit squared as it has been done in [9] for

the pure magnetic eld case

with allowance for (4), (15) and for the fact that l = 0, this equation can be written in the
form

(22)

(24)

(25)

dbr2e =d2e dbr2
ce .
dbr2e =d2e + a* 1

+  .

thus, the average magnetic ux in a stationary state (ordinary units are again used) takes the
form

 = dbr2e b l2

b =dbr2e 0,

where 0 = 2ch/e is the magnetic ux quantum.

(26)

calculations demonstrated that, for stationary states (13), the quantity  is the integral

multiple of 0

 = (n + 1) 0, n = 2, 3, ....

(27)

in the following, the results of calculations are illustrated by the examples for the cases of

states f10 and f20. for the state f10 we have a = 1,

 = 2

f10 () = exp(cid:16)2/4(cid:17) (1 + ) ,
d2e =(cid:16)10 + 32(cid:17) /(cid:16)3 + 2(cid:17) ,
+ =(cid:16)2 + 2(cid:17) /(cid:16)3 + 2(cid:17) ,
* 1

for the state f20 we have a = 6,

dbr2e = 2.
f20 () = exp(cid:16)2/4(cid:17) (cid:16)1 + 6 + 2(cid:17) ,

 = 3

d2e =(cid:16)114 + 363(cid:17) /25 + 83,
* 1
+ = 6(cid:16)6 + 2(cid:17) /(cid:16)25 + 82(cid:17) ,

dbr2e = 3.

we believe that formula (26) is valid for all the unique states, though we are unable to present
a general proof of this statement now.
