abstract

the paper is devoted to the formulation of quantum eld theory for
an early universe in general relativity considered as the dirac general
constrained system. the main idea is the hamiltonian reduction of
the constrained system in terms of measurable quantities of the obser-
vational cosmology: the world proper time, cosmic scale factor, and
the density of matter. we dene  particles as eld variables in the
holomorphic representation which diagonalize the measurable density.
the bogoliubov quasiparticles are determined by diagonalization of
the equations of motion (but not only of the initial hamiltonian) to
get the set of integrals of motion (or conserved quantum numbers, in
quantum theory). this approach is applied to describe particle cre-
ation in the models of the early universe where the hubble parameter
goes to innity.

introduction

all modern relativistic eld theories describe constrained systems with a set of superuous
degrees of freedom and pure gauge elds. an identication of physical variables and quantities,
in gauge theories and general relativity (gr), is a long-time problem which stimulated dirac to
formulate, for this aim, the general hamiltonian theory for constrained systems [1] developed
later by many authors (see e.g. monographs [2, 3]). the essence of the dirac approach to
constrained systems is the reduction of the initial extended phase space to separate the true
physical variables from the parameters of gauge and general coordinate transformations and to
construct a dynamic equivalent unconstrained system in the reduced phase space in terms of
gauge-invariant variables which are called the dirac observables.

however, the application of the dirac scheme of the hamiltonian reduction to eld theories
invariant with respect to the reparametrization of time (gr and cosmological models) meets
with an additional peculiarity:
in these theories there are superuous variables which are
excluded by constraints and abandon the sector of physical variables (i.e. dirac observables),
but not the sector of measurable quantities 1 [4, 5, 6].

examples of such variables are the cosmic scale factor and the invariant proper time treated
as measurable quantities in cosmological models. in this case, set of equations of the reduced
theory does not reect all the physical content of the initial extended theory and must be
supplemented by two equations for the superuous variable and its momentum [5]. the second
equation leads to the friedmann-hubble law of evolution of the universe (i.e. the dependence
of the red shift of spectral lines of the cosmic object atoms on a distance of this object from
the earth); while the rst one determines the evolution of measurable density of matter [6].

in the present paper, we would like to reconsider the problem of particles and quasipar-
ticles in the early universe [8, 9, 10, 11] in the context of the dirac approach to constrained
systems supplemented by the sector of measurable quantities [4, 5, 6].

the basic idea is the denition of particles as eld variables in the holomorphic repre-
sentation [2] which diagonalize the measurable density in the supplemented equations of the
evolution of the universe.

to get the set of integrals of motion (or conserved quantum numbers in quantum theory), we
apply the bogoliubov transformations of particle variables for diagonalization of the equations
of motion (but not only of the initial hamiltonian [8, 9, 10, 11]), in the correspondence with
the original idea in bogoliubovs paper [12] where these transformations were considered as an
eective mathematical tool to construct the energy spectrum of a weakly non-ideal bose gas.
the bogoliubov quasiparticles are determined as eld variables with conserved numbers of

quasiparticles.

in the next section, we formulate the problem and the model. in section 3, measurable
particles are dened. in section 4, we introduce the bogoliubov transformations to diagonalize
equations of motion. section 5 is devoted to the description of creation of massive particles
and gravitons in the early universe.

1it is worth to recall that yet in 1873 j.c.maxwell wrote [7] the most important aspect of any phenomenon
from mathematical point of view is that of a measurable quantity. i shall therefore consider electrical phenomena
chiey with a view to their measurement describing the methods of measurement and dening the standards
on which they depend.

(2)

the matter lagrangian in the action describes a set of boson and fermion elds. the problems
of initial data and classical and quantum hamiltonian dynamics of these elds in gr are con-
ventionally formulated in terms of the so-called lichnerowicz conformal-invariant eld variables
and metric [17, 18]

where (n = 1,3/2, 0, 2) is the conformal weight for scalar, vector, spinor, and tensor elds,
respectively, nc is the conformal lapse function, dsc is the conformal interval.
as a result, the action of gr in terms of the conformal variables (3) has the structure [5]

of the penrose-chernikov-tagirov action [19] for the conformal scalar eld

where l(g=0) is the massless part of the matter lagrangian, b and f are the mass terms of
the boson and fermion elds, respectively, both the newton constant and masses of elementary
particles are formed by the metric scale eld g

g = ||(3)g||1/6.

(5)

action (4) can be considered also as scalar version [5, 6] of the weyl conformal theory [20],
where the metric scale eld (5) plays the role of the lichnerowicz variable (3) of a scalar eld
considered as the measure of a change of the length of a vector in its parallel transport and,
simultaneously, as a modulus of the higgs scalar eld in the standard model of unication
of electroweak and strong interactions. dynamics of both the theories (the einstein gr and
the weyl one) is the same, but not standards of measurement. an einstein observer measures
the absolute lengths (ds)e, while a weyl observer can measure only the ratio of lengths of two
vectors (ds)w = (ds1)e/(ds2)e = (ds1)c/(ds2)c which is conformal-invariant.

the dirac-adm-action and interval (2) are invariant with respect to transformations of a

kinemetric subgroup of the group of general coordinate transformations [14, 5, 15]

(6)

this group of dieomorphism of the hamiltonian description of gr includes reparametrizations
of the coordinate time which could not be treated as the observable evolution parameter of
the reparametrization-invariant hamiltonian dynamics of the universe.

one of the main problems of the hamiltonian reduction in gr is to pick out the global
variable which can represent the internal evolution parameter of the corresponding reduced
system.

3

there is a lot of speculations on this subject, here we try to continue these attempts in the
spirit of identication of this internal evolution parameter in gr with the global component
of the metric scale eld (5) (or, the scalar eld in the weyl theory [6]) [18, 5, 6]

g(t, x) = ||(3)g(t, x)||1/6 = 0(t )a(t, x).

(7)

here t is the world conformal time formed by the global component n0 of the conformal lapse
function:

(8)
fields n (t, x); a(t, x) begin from unit, n (t, x) = 1 + ..., in the cosmological perturbation
theory [16] and form interactions of the elds with the positive contribution to the energy
constraint.

nc(t, x) = n0(t)n (t, x);

dt = n0(t)dt.

when interactions are neglected (a = n = 1; n k = 0; gc

ij = ij + hij), the gr action is
reduced to the action of the well-known system of free conformal elds in a nite space-volume

gr, an observer measures in the comoving frame the friedmann world time (tf ) connected
with t by the relation

(  t);

dtf (t ) = 0(t )dt.

(14)

finally, we get the following statement of the problems considered in the present paper:
to full the hamiltonian reduction in the theory described by action (9), and to
quantize the reduced version of the theory.

where the scale factor 0 plays the role of the evolution parameter and h r is the corresponding
hamiltonian of evolution.

the local equations of motion of systems (16) reproduce the invariant sector of the initial
extended system and determine the evolution of elds (pf , f ) with respect to the internal
evolution parameter 0

which is a square root of the wheeler-dewitt equation hwdw = 0.

we should emphasize that no one reduced scheme (the classical one and two quantum)
contains the evolution of the universe in terms of the world time t measured by an observer
in the comoving frame, as no one reduced scheme contains this time dt = n0dt.

the evolution of the universe is the dependence of the world time t on the internal
evolution parameter 0. this dependence is described by the equation for the superuous
momentum p0 (which is omitted by the reduced action w r)

hub(tf ) is the hubble parameter).

(where hf
on the internal evolution parameter (here, the cosmic scale factor 0).

the redshift-data z(d) determine the observational dependence of the world proper time

5

for a relativistic particle described by action (13) the dependence of the proper time t
(measured by an observer in the comoving frame) with respect to the internal evolution param-
eter (x0) (measured by another observer in the rest frame) is nothing but the dynamic version
of the lorentz transformation.

there is an essential physical dierence between special relativity (sr) and general rel-
ativity (gr). in sr, two times (the proper time t and internal evolution parameter x0) are
measured in two dierent frames (the comoving and rest ones) which exclude each other. while
in gr, both the times, t and 0, are measured by an observer in the comoving frame. the re-
lation between these two times forms the evolution of the universe (19). this evolution depends
on standards of measurement of the time.

the same gr dynamics (with the same wheeler-dewitt wave function) corresponds to
dierent cosmological pictures for dierent observers: an einstein observer, who supposes that
he measures an absolute interval, obtains the friedmann-robertson-walker (frw) cosmology
where the red shift is treated as expansion of the universe; a weyl observer, who supposes that
he measures a relative interval dc, obtains the hoyle-narlikar cosmology [21]. the red shift

the comparison of direct observations of masses and numbers of particles in the universe
with the density of matter measured by the hubble law (20), or (21), in the context of quantum
eld theory, means the particle-like treatment of the corresponding hamiltonian for free elds
h0 which forms this density. the particle-like representation of h0 has the form

h0 = xk;f =h,p,v,s

af (k; 0) naf

where naf is the number of particles
naf = {a+

((+) corresponds to bosons; and (), to fermions); and af (k; 0) is the one-particle energy

af (k; 0) = qk2 + (yf 0)2

(27)

for gravitons (h) and photons (p) with (y = 0), and for bosons (v) and fermions (s) with (y 6= 0).
thus, the concepts of measurable times lead to concepts of the measurable hamiltonian
and particles. in contrast with the conventional approach [8, 9, 10, 11] (where particles are
dened as constant coecients of the decomposition of eld variables over classical solutions),
we dene the observable particles as eld dynamic variables in the holomorphic representation
which diagonalize the observable hamiltonian h0 in the form (25).

this holomorphic representation of eld variables [2] is

where <> denotes the matrix element between states with denite spins, and (k, 0), (0) is
dened by initial data. in the following, for simplicity, we consider photons (p = 0), massive
bosons (v), and gravitons (h).

on the present-day stage, f  0 and numbers of all particles are conserved. in this case,
the proper time dynamics with a xed number of massive particles (k = 0) leads to the hubble
law for the dust stage of classical universe and the corresponding wave function of the universe
expressed in terms of the proper time has the form [4]

r(0(t )|f ) = exp(imdusttf ) < f|mdust >;

( dtf = 0(t )dt ),

where mdust is a sum of all particle masses of the universe, < f|m > is the product of oscillator
wave functions, tf is the friedmann time and t is the conformal one. as we have seen above,

7

the quantum universe lled in by a xed number (1088) of massless particles (photons) is
described by the wave function

r(0(t )|f ) = exp(ieradiationt ) < f|eradiation >

and by the hubble law of the classical universe in the radiation stage [4]. thus, the separation
of the global observable time and energies allows us to unify classical and quantum eld theory
with the classical and quantum cosmologies and to give the perspective of the construction of
quantum gravity as a quantum version of the cosmological perturbation theory [16].

in the early universe,  6= 0 and numbers of particles are not conserved

d nf (t )

dt

6= 0.

the problem is to nd integrals of motion of time-reparametrization system

(29) and to describe creation of particles in the evolution of the universe.

4. bogoliubov quasiparticles: integrals of motion

to construct integrals of motion in the context of the above-mentioned hamiltonian reduction,
we use the bogoliubov transformations [12] of particle variables

b+ = a+ +  a,

b = a + a+;

||2  ||2 = 1,

(32)

which diagonalize the corresponding classical equations expressed in terms of particles (a+, a),
so that the number of quasiparticles is conserved

the classical equations for action (29) can be written as

equations (41)-(47) represent a complete set of equations of classical theory in terms of the
holomorphic variables. this theory has a set of integrals of motion (45) which should be con-
verted into the quantum numbers of the corresponding quantum reduced system in agreement
with the correspondence principle.

5. creation of particles

as 0 left the phase space to convert into the internal evolution parameter, in quantum theory
we can quantize only the particle sector

[a, a+] = 1 ;

[b, b+] = 1.

(48)

in the following, we restrict ourselves to the universe in the state of vacuum of quasiparticles
(i.e. the squeezed vacuum):

the quantum equation for the early universe coincides with the schrodinger one, and the
wave function of the state of nothing is dened as the squeezed vacuum bf (k, 0)|0 >b= 0 with
the scale factor and the particle numbers given by eqs. (46) and (47).

we can see that for a weyl observer (with the relative standard of length) there can be a period
of the very fast ination-like evolution of the cosmic scale factor, while an einstein-friedmann
observer (with the absolute standard of the length) sees the linear dependence of the measured
proper time on the scale factor. thus, ten billion years for an observer with the absolute
standard can convert into the biblical short period of several thousand years for an observer
with the relative standard.

6. conclusion

we have considered the concepts of particle and quasiparticle in the eld theory with the
time-reparametrization invariance and the energy constraint, using as an example the descrip-
tion of the universe in general relativity.

the peculiarity of constrained systems is the presence of superuous degrees of freedom.
removing these superuous degrees of freedom from the constrained theory is the aim of the
hamiltonian reduction which has to represent (according to the dirac theory) an equivalent
unconstrained system limited by the sector of the dirac observables.

however, in the considered case the sector of the dirac observables does not include all
measurable quantities. the superuous variables, leaving the phase space, remain in the
theory as measurable quantities out of the sector of the dirac observables of the reduced
version.
in particular, to describe in the generalized hamiltonian theory the hubble law of
evolution of the universe (measured in observational cosmology) we are enforced to remain in
the theory two time-like variables: the world proper time (measured in the comoving frame)
and cosmic scale factor (as the internal evolution parameter). while for the description of
evolution of the dirac observables (i.e. the reduced theory) one invariant time parameter is
sucient. the evolution of the universe (as the dependence of the proper time on the internal
evolution parameter) goes beyond the scope of the equivalent reduced theory and determines
the measurable density of the matter eld. particles are the variables which diagonalize
this measurable density. quasiparticles are the variables which diagonalize the equations of
motion and determine a set of integrals of motion. these denitions strongly dier from the
conventional approach [8, 9, 10, 11] which goes from the conserved particles as initial data
(i.e. constant coecients of the eld decomposition over classical solutions) to unconserved
quasiparticles with diagonalization of the initial hamiltonian, but not the equations of motion.
the bogoliubov quasiparticles classify the states of the universe in both the classical theory
and the quantum one. the states with a xed number of quasiparticles are squeezed states

for particles. the bogoliubov quasiparticles allow us to dene the state of nothing as the
squeezed vacuum.

the formulation of classical and quantum versions of general relativity in terms of mea-
surable quantities leads to unication of classical and quantum cosmologies with qft in gr
and reveals the dependence of the classical evolution of the universe and the wave function of
the universe on methods of measurement and their standards.

an einstein observer measuring lengths by the absolute standard sees the expansion of the
universe, while a weyl observer (who can measure the ratio of lengths of two vectors) sees the
hoyle-narlikar evolution.

we considered the dierence between a weyl observer and an einstein observer using, as
an example, the evolution of the early universe. a weyl observer (with relative standard of
length) sees the squeezed vacuum ination of particle masses due to the zero energy excitation
in the spectrum of quasigravitons, while an einstein observer sees the linear dependence of the
scale factor on the world time for the same dynamics.
