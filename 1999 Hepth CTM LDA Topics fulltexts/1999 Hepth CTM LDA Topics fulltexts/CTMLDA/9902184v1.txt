abstract

we consider quantum n = 4 super yang-mills theory interact-
ing in a covariant way with n = 4 conformal supergravity. the in-
duced large n eective action for such a theory is calculated on a
dilaton-gravitational background using the conformal anomaly found
via ads/cft correspondence. considering such an eective action as
a quantum correction to the classical gravity action we study quantum
cosmology. in particular, the eect from dilaton to the scale factor
(which without dilaton corresponds to the inationary universe) is in-
vestigated. it is shown that, dependent on the initial conditions for
the dilaton, the dilaton may slow down, or accelerate, the ination
process. at late times, the dilaton is decaying exponentially.

the inationary universe (for a general review, see [1]) is considered to
be a quite realistic element of the very early universe evolution. recently
there appeared evidence, however, that the present universe is subject to
accelerated expansion and may thus be entering an inationary phase now.
this calls for a reconsideration of quantum cosmology and construction of
new (or modied) versions of the theory of the very early universe.

in the present letter, aimed towards this purpose, we consider quantum
cosmology as induced from n = 4 quantum super ym theory on the back-
ground n = 4 conformal supergravity. such theories have become very pop-
ular recently in connection with ads/cft correspondence. using conformal
anomaly on a dilaton-gravitational background we construct the anomaly in-
duced eective action and study the consequences it may lead to in the early
universe.
it is known that on a purely gravitational background such an
eective action leads to the possibility of ination. as we will show, the role
of the dilaton is to accelerate, or to slow down, the inationary expansion,
depending on the choice of initial conditions for the dilaton.

let us start from the lagrangian of local superconformally invariant n
= 4 super ym theory in the background of n = 4 conformal supergravity
(see [2] for introduction and review). the corresponding vector multiplet
is (a, i, xij). supposing that super ym theory interacts with conformal
supergravity in a su(1,1) covariant way and keeping only kinetic terms, we
get:

lsy m =

note that the complex scalar  from the conformal supergravity multiplet is
written as c + ie. it is also to be noted that the rst term in (1) describes
the dilaton coupled electromagnetic eld whose conformal anomaly has been
found in [3].

despite the fact that n = 4 super ym theory is nite in minkowski
space, such a theory on a curved background contains divergences (vacuum
polarization, or the action for external elds; see [4] for a review). the
standard calculation based upon the background eld method (see [4] for an
introduction) gives the vacuum polarization (divergent part of the eective
action) which is the action of the n = 4 conformal supergravity [5]. at the

2

same time, div is actually proportional to the a2-coecient of the proper
time expansion. this coecient denes also the conformal anomaly of super
ym theory.

on a purely bosonic background with only non-zero gravitational and
dilaton elds, the conformal anomaly for n = 4 super ym theory has been
calculated in [9] via ads/cft correspondence [6], [7], [8] to be

t = b(f +

we have used that ns = 6, nf = 2, nv = 1 in n = 4 su(n) super ym
theory; f = rr  2rr + 1
3 r2 is the square of the weyl tensor
in four dimensions; g is the gauss-bonnet invariant. the prefactor n 2  1
appears because all elds are in the adjoint representation. as the ads/cft
correspondence gives only the large n limit, only the part proportional to n 2
in (2) has been found in [9] (with accuracy up to the r term). note that
the coecient b is known to be in general ambiguous. in the above super
ym theory b may be equal to zero, as one can see from a direct calculation
(see [10] for a review). on the other hand, in the scheme advocated in [5],
b is found to be such that it cancels out the r contribution in the rst
term and no r-term remains in the total conformal anomaly (2). in this
last case, the conformal anomaly (including all terms, not only metric and
dilaton) coincides with the action of n = 4 conformal supergravity.
rewritten in the following form (up to a total derivative)

it is of interest to note that the dilaton dependent term in (2) may be

acting on scalars.

let us now nd the anomaly induced eective action [11]. we will write

it in non-covariant, local form:

note that in the conformal anomaly (2) we used g = e2 g, and all
quantities in (4) are calculated with the help of the overbar metric.

as is known, the anomaly induced eective action is dened with accuracy
up to a conformally invariant functional. we limit ourselves to a conformally
at metric, i. e. g = . in this case, the conformally invariant functional
on a purely gravitational background is zero, and w in eq.(4) gives the
complete contribution to the one-loop eective action.
(this conformally
invariant functional is not zero in the presence of the dilaton. there is no
way to calculate it in closed form; one has to use the schwinger-de witt
expansion. nevertheless, one can show that its eect on w will be small.)
we also assume that only the real part of the dilaton is non-zero.

the anomaly induced eective action (4) may now be simplied signi-

cantly (due to the fact that g = ):

w = z d4x[ 2b

( + )2 + c

(5)

where all derivatives are now at ones.

we consider the case when the scale factor a() depends only on conformal
time: () = ln a(). then one has to add the anomaly induced eective
action to the classical gravitational action:

scl =

 z d4xg r =

 z d4xe2 ( )2,

(6)

where  = 16g.

now one can write the equations of motion for the action scl + w . we
assume that  and  depend only on the conformal time . the equations
of motion for stotal = scl + w have the following form:

2(3b + 2b)

  = 0,

ln a  + (ln a ) = 0,

(7)
where 3b + 2b 6= 0. as we said above, the natural choice for b is to
take b = 0, corresponding to not making any nite renormalization of the
gravitational action.

3 b ( corresponding to the scheme advocated in

[5]), the rst of eqs.(7) simplies:

note that when b =  2

first of all, we make the transformation to cosmological time in the above
equations: dt = a() d. then the rst of the equations of motion (7) takes
the following form:

as one can see, these equations are too complicated to be solved analytically
in general.

let us consider rst the solution when dilaton is absent. for the rst
choice b = 0 we get the following special solution: a(t) = a0 eht, where
h 2 =  1
b , a0 being an arbitrary constant. this inationary solution (for
positive h) has been rst found by starobinsky and mamaev-mostepanenko
in [12] using the renormalized emt of conformal matter on the right-hand
side of einsteins equations. it has also been recovered in the third reference
in [11], using the eective action approach [4].

for the second choice b =  2

3 b we get just the the same solution a(t) =
a0eht. that indicates a physical equivalence of the above two forms for the
conformal anomaly (at least in some specic situations).

now we consider the solution with non-zero dilaton. we look at the
approximate special solution of eq.(10) when the term with ln a may be
dropped. since a(t) = a0eht, ln a  ht.moreover, h is proportional to the
planck mass, so ht is an extremely small quantity and our approximation is
justied.

then, we search for special solutions of the sort:
(t)  0e ht
from eq.(10) (without logarithmic term) we obtain

a(t)  a0e

ht,

(t) = 1e

ht + 2e2.62 ht + 3e0.38 ht,

(11)

(12)

where the 1, 2, 3 are constants. taking the particular solution (t) =
0e ht from eq.(12) and substituting it back in eq.(9) we obtain

(13)

this solution is the same for any choice of b.

as is easily seen, for   2.62 or   0.38 the denominator in eq.(13)
is increasing in absolute value, being negative all the time. as a result, for
b . hence, the eect of dilaton is to slow down the

ination.

for the mode  = 3

2 , the second term in the denominator is positive,
hence h 2 > h 2. the role of the dilaton in this case is to make the ination

faster, as compared with the case of no dilaton. without the inuence from
dilaton, the duration of ination is high enough:

t

n,

(14)

where n is the number corresponding to expansion of the universe at 10n
times. taking, for example, n = 4 (su(4) super ym) and taking n  30,
we obtain the necessary duration of ination which is just two orders of
magnitude greater than the planck time. then, for initial conditions 1 
0, 2 = 3 = 0, due to faster ination t is getting smaller and the above
choice of n is not enough to meet the necessary requirement of duration of
ination. if 1 = 0 with the same choice for time interval we get higher than
necessary duration of ination as dilaton eect.

in summary, we have discussed quantum cosmology from n = 4 super ym
theory on a dilaton-gravitational background. as one solution we found the
inationary (conformally at) universe with exponentially decaying dilaton.
it is not dicult to consider other cosmogical models (say closed or open
frw), or other types of behaviour of the scale factor. however in this case
one should do a numerical study of the eective equations of motion. the
results, of course, should depend very much on the choice of initial conditions
for a(t), (t) and their derivatives.
