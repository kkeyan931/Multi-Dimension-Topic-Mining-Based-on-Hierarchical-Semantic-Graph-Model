abstract

by making use of the langevin equation with a kernel, it was shown that the feynman
measure es can be realized in a restricted sense in a diusive stochastic process, which
diverges and has no equilibrium, for bottomless systems. in this paper, the dependence on
the initial conditions and the temporal behavior are analyzed for 0-dim bottomless systems.
furthermore, it is shown that it is possible to nd stationary quantities.

introduction

it remains an unsettled question in quantum eld theory how to deal with bottomless
systems, i.e. systems whose euclidean actions are unbounded from below. important
and familiar examples include einstein gravity [1]. the fact that one cannot dene the
vacuum for such systems makes it impossible to quantize them in the usual ways. the
standard path integral quantization procedure, for example, is not applicable, since the
feynman measure es with a bottomless action s is not normalizable and the vacuum
expectation values cannot be dened.

in the language of the stochastic quantization of parisi and wu [2], the diculty
with bottomless systems manifests itself as the absence of thermal equilibrium, where
quantum theory is supposed to be realized for ordinary (normal) systems.
in spite
of this apparent drawback, however, it has been argued by several people that the
potentiality inherent in yet to be studied stochastic dynamics may oer the possibility
to properly deal with bottomless systems. such attempts have already been started in
refs. [3] and [4], though on the basis of quite dierent ideas. an analytical expression
of the probability distribution obtained for 0-dim bottomless systems [5] supports the
idea expressed in ref. [4], i.e. realization of the feynman measure es in a nite space-
time region at nite ctitious time by means of the kernel-degree of freedom. we must
note that here the stochastic process is of the diusion type and has no equilibrium for
bottomless systems, since the desired distribution es is not normalizable and therefore
no longer belongs to the spectrum of the fokkerplanck operator h; every eigenstate
of h necessarily decays away in the large-time limit. every quantity measured in this
process is thus dependent on the initial conditions and is dependent on a ctitious time,
in general. this is a severe problem if one tries to extract from this kind of treatment
physically meaningful and sensible quantities, which should, of course, be independent
of any of the stochastic dynamics.

the purpose of this paper is thus rst to examine the dependence of the probabil-
ity distribution on the initial conditions and to clarify the behavior of the correlation
functions in this framework. it is observed that at large ctitious times the correlation
functions diuse quite universally, irrespectively of the initial distribution. this sug-
gests the possibility of extracting such a quantity that does not depend on the initial
conditions at large times. we then propose a method that enables us to extract it from
the diusive stochastic process.

2. stochastic quantization with bottomless systems

let us rst briey review the stochastic quantization of parisi and wu [2]. in stochas-
tically quantizing the system with a euclidean action s[], one sets up the langevin
equation


t

(x, t) = 

s[]
(x, t)

+ (x, t),

(2.1)

1

which governs the stochastic dynamics of  with respect to the ctitious time t. here
 is the gaussian white noise characterized by the statistical properties

h(x, t)i = 0,

h(x, t)(x, t)i = 2d(x  x)(t  t),

etc.

(2.2)

the quantum theory has been shown to be realized in the thermal equilibrium limit
t  . one can equivalently work with the fokkerplanck equation


t

p [; t] = h[]p [; t],

with

h[] = z ddx



(x)   

(x)

+

s[]

(x)! ,

(2.3)

(2.4)

where p [; t] is the probability distribution of  at time t. it is easy to show that the
fokkerplanck operator h is negative semi-denite for any s and that the eigenfunc-
tional of h belonging to the highest zero eigenvalue is es, which ensures the relaxation
of p to the distribution  es, irrespective of the choice of the initial distribution, pro-
vided that the spectrum includes the discrete zero. quantum eld theory is thus given
in the thermal equilibrium limit of a hypothetical stochastic process.

this is, however, not the case with bottomless systems, since es is not normalizable
and hence does not belong to the spectrum of the fokkerplanck operator h. eigen-
values are negative denite, and the hypothetical stochastic process has no thermal
equilibrium limit (i.e., it is a diusion process).

3. attempts to deal with bottomless systems

although the naive application of stochastic quantization to bottomless systems does
not work, some attempts to deal with them have been reported [3, 4]. greensite and
halpern [3] assumed that the meaningful distribution function in a diusive stochastic
process for bottomless systems is the highest normalizable eigenstate of the fokker
planck operator. that is, they gave up using the feynman measure es to evaluate
expectation values, since es, which is not normalizable for the bottomless action s,
cannot belong to the spectrum of the fokkerplanck operator. instead, they proposed
to utilize its true ground state: the feynman measure es was abandoned. since the
true ground state is not a stationary state and it nally decays away at large times,
they had to devise a way how to extract it from the diusive stochastic process.

on the other hand, tanaka et al. pursued the possibility of producing the distribution

es even for a bottomless action s by making use of the langevin equation


t

(x, t) = k[]

s[]
(x, t)

+

k[]
(x, t)

+ k 1/2[](x, t)

(3.1)

with a positive kernel functional k [4]. here and in what follows, stochastic dierential
equations are of the ito-type [6]. note that the corresponding fokkerplanck operator

2

is given by

h[] = z ddx



(x)

k[]  

(x)

+

s[]

(x)! ,

(3.2)

which has negative semi-denite eigenvalues for any positive kernel k, and that the
thermal equilibrium distribution could again be given by es only if it is normalizable.
they expected that an appropriate choice of the positive kernel k may enable stochastic
variables to be conned in a nite region and that the desired distribution es could
be reproduced there. their numerical simulation of the langevin equation (3.1) with a
specic choice of the kernel k for simple 0-dim models actually seems to support their
expectation.

in order to see the actual stochastic dynamics more clearly and in detail, let us

restrict ourselves to 0-dim cases. the langevin equation now reads

x = k(x)s (x) + k (x) + k 1/2(x),

and the corresponding fokkerplanck equation is given by

p (x, t) =


x

k(x)  

x

+ s (x)! p (x, t).

(3.3)

(3.4)

here dots and primes denote dierentiation with respect to the ctitious time t and x,
respectively. it is shown in ref. [5] that the fokkerplanck equation (3.4) can be solved
analytically with an appropriate choice of the kernel function k for any 0-dim action s
which is unbounded from below for x  . the choice of the kernel k

k(x) = e2s(x)

(3.5)

yields the green function for the fokkerplanck equation (3.4) [5]

exp 
this satises the normalization conditionr 
 dx p (x, t; x0) = 1 and the initial condition
p (x, 0; x0) = (x  x0). the choice of the kernel (3.5) provides the langevin equation

with the desired drift force e2s(x)s (x) which acts as a restoring force in bottomless
regions (that is, for large |x| with xs (x) < 0).
as tanaka et al. expected. consider the domain given by

one can conrm from eq. (3.6) that the desired distribution es is indeed realized,

dt = {x|f 2(x) < 2t}

(3.8)

at a given time t with   1 a real constant. note that 2t is the variance of the distri-
bution p as a function of f (x), and therefore, outside this domain dt, p is considered

3

to be vanishingly small owing to the gaussian factor in eq. (3.6). within dt, on the
other hand, this factor is considered to be of order unity and we have the approximate
distribution

zt

es(x)

(3.9)

p (x, t; x0) 

for x  dt,

where zt  rdt dx es(x) = rdt df = 8t. the desired distribution es is seen to
be realized in dt with the appropriate normalization factor zt.
in other words, the
stochastic variable x is considered to be distributed according to p  es/zt, exclusively
in dt at time t.

4. temporal behavior of the probability distribu-

tion

in order to conrm the above argument and for illustration, we consider a typical
0-dim bottomless system given by s(x) = m2x2/2  x4/4 ( > 0) and directly
study the behavior of the probability distribution p as a function of t. figure 1
displays its temporal behavior, starting from the initial (ideally delta-shaped) distri-

bution p (x, 0; x0) = (x  x0), where x0 = 1.5a with a = qm2/ being the position
of a maximum of the action. note that although the starting point of the stochas-
tic variable x = x0 is in the bottomless regions (i.e. |x| > a), the diusion is well
controlled (i.e., p remains in a nite region even at very large t) owing to the restor-
ing force resulting from the kernel (3.5). furthermore, we can see in fig. 2, where
s(x, t; x0) =  ln[4tp (x, t; x0)] [see eq. (3.6)] is plotted together with s, that the dis-

tribution p (x, t; x0) is well approximated as es within the domain where the stochastic
variable is exclusively distributed. this is in accordance with the expectation discussed
in the previous paragraph.

even though the desired feynman measure es seems to be realized in the course
of the stochastic process, the process is of the diusion type and has no equilibrium,
as is explicitly seen in the analytical expression (3.6). the distribution p decays as
time increases, and expectation values over p have no thermal equilibrium limits and
may depend in general on the choice of the initial conditions. figure 3 shows the
 dx x2p (x, t; x0) for the same system as above but with
dierent initial data. this quantity increases indenitely and no thermal equilibrium
limit exists. note that possible errors that arise in the course of numerical evaluation
of the integrations are very small, typically of order 106.

temporal behavior of hx2it = r 

it is, however, worth pointing out that the same gure (fig. 3) also exhibits a
universal behavior of the expectation values. after the initial transient time, hx2it turns
out to approach a unique curve, albeit monotonically increasing with t, irrespectively of
the choice of initial conditions. this may imply the possibility of extracting physics
underlying bottomless systems through the diusive stochastic process.

5. stationary quantities in the diusive process

in order to address this apparently ambitious hope, let us examine the situation more
carefully. since we do not know which quantity is to be regarded physically meaningful
for bottomless systems, it seems reasonable for us to assume that a physical quantity
within the framework of stochastic quantization is one that has a long-time limit, ir-
respective of the initial conditions, for any systems including bottomless ones. this is
in accordance with the original spirit of stochastic quantization and may be considered
a minimal requirement.
[of course, this is just one possibility, and our assumption is
not meant to exclude other possibilities, such as that presented in ref. [3].] for dif-
fusive stochastic processes, however, whether such a quantity exists or not is a highly
nontrivial question, because we naturally anticipate that every quantity should have a
trivial (either vanishing or diverging) large-time limit. the idea here is to discriminate
dierent dynamics possibly coexisting in such diusion processes. in other words, our
task is to extract appropriate physics underneath the dominating diusive process
caused by the unboundedness of the classical action. the following analysis is a rst
step along this line of thought.

observe that the domain dt dened by eq. (3.8) expands monotonically as t in-
creases. this represents one of the main features of diusion. we attempt to estimate

6

this expansion quantitatively. let x+(t) [x(t)] be the right(left) end of the domain dt:

z x(t)

x0

dy es(y) = q2t.

(5.1)

[see eqs. (3.8) and (3.6).] if we change the initial position x0 by an innitesimal amount
x0, it yields the following changes in x(t):

x = es(x)s(x0)x0.

(5.2)

this shows that x become vanishingly small as time increases, since x+ increases and
x decreases monotonically in time and therefore es(x)  0. the dierence between
the domains dt for dierent values of x0 then disappears. this implies an approach to
a unique distribution p  es. this is the reason that we observe a unique curve for
expectation values at large times in fig. 3. it is important to note that the expansion of
dt is well controlled in this stochastic process. in fact, we can easily see, from eq. (5.1),

x = r 

2t

es(x)  

2
zt

es(x),

(5.3)

which implies that the expansion rate diminishes exponentially at large t (or large |x|).
this observation may enable us to extract a quantity that has a long-time limit.
let us examine the time development of the expectation value of an arbitrary function
 dx f (x)p (x, t; x0). using the fokkerplanck equation (3.4), we

f (x), hf (x)it = r 

obtain its time derivative:

d

dthf (x)it = z

dx f (x)


x

e2s(x)  

x

+ s (x)! p (x, t; x0)

dx   

x

es(x)f (x)! es(x)p (x, t; x0).

this can be rewritten, under the validity of the approximation (3.9), as

es(x)f (x) =

es(x)f (x)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

with the help of the equations for x+(t) and x(t) in eq. (5.3), it can be further reduced
to

has a t-independent value for large t. roughly speaking, hhf (x)iit is a quantity reect-
ing the quantum uctuations in the bottomless system, since the rst two terms in
the square parentheses represent deterministic contributions.
[remember that the
dynamics for x(t) in eq. (5.3) are deterministic.]

the above argument has been conrmed by the numerical calculation of hhx2iit for
the system s(x) = m2x2/2  x4/4 whose results are given in fig. 4. (here errors are
typically of order 104.) these results show that after the initial transient time, the
quantity hhx2iit approaches a certain value, which is constant over a wide range of large
t, irrespectively of the choice of the initial position x0. similar behavior is observed for
other correlation functions.

6. discussion

the observation of a time-independent quantity in a diusive (or diverging) stochastic
process is surprising and worthy of note. we hope that it will lead to further insight
for bottomless systems. the above quantity hhf (x)iit is a candidate for the time-
independent quantity, representing a kind of quantum eect in such systems. it can be
thought, as described above, to be a measure of the quantum uctuations for bottomless
systems.

8

we must remember, however, that the present analysis is largely dependent on our
choice of the specic kernel function k(x) (3.5). in particular, the asymptotic value
of hhf (x)iit possibly depends on the very choice of the kernel. even though it seems
plausible that for bottomless systems meaningful quantities are rather limited, and
accordingly not all conceivable kernels can provide us with them, it is very important
to clarify this point, e.g. by determining the kernel dependence of hhf (x)iit. this is
an important issue to be studied, though a dierent choice of the kernel no longer ensures
the solvability of the fokkerplanck equation and may entail an additional numerical
study in order to obtain the probability distribution p . other points worth further
investigation include (a) the relevance (if any) of hhf (x)iit to observable quantities, (b)
formulation on the basis of the corresponding langevin equation (3.7), (c) comparison
with other proposals [3], and (d) extension to higher dimensional systems. work is in
progress on these points.
