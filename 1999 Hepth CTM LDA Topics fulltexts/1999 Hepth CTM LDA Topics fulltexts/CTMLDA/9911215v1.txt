abstract

the renormalization group approach towards the string representation of non

abelian gauge theories translates, in terms of the string sigma model beta func-

tion equations, the renormalization group evolution of the gauge coupling con-

stant and zamolodchikovs c function. tachyon stability, glueball mass gap,

renormalization group evolution of the c function and the area law for the wil-

son loop are studied for a critical bosonic string vacuum corresponding to a non

abelian gauge theory in four dimensional space-time. we prove that the same

intrinsic geometry for the string vacuum is universal in some sense, reproducing

the yang-mills beta function to arbitrary loop order in perturbation theory.

phenomenologically the string approach to non abelian gauge theories is based on inter-

preting the color ux tubes responsible for quark connement as strings ending on quark-

antiquark pairs. from a more theoretical point of view a string representation of a gauge

theory amounts to dene vacuum expectation values for wilson loops as sums over random

surfaces with boundary given by the loop. after the discovery of d-branes a new way to as-

sociate strings with pure gauge theories has been suggested based on strong-weak coupling

duality. in that approach, based on maldacenas conjecture [16], the strong t hoofts cou-

pling regime is in correspondence with weakly coupled type iib string theory. the weakly

coupled yang mills is in this case described by strongly coupled string theory and therefore

out of present technology. a similar problem arises when the type iib description is ex-

tended to non supersymmetric theories [21] with the supergravity regime being dened by

thoofts coupling much larger that the natural cuto, implying the presence of undesired

degrees of freedom.

in the same vein (of working out a string description of the low energy world volume

theory on d-branes) type 0 string theories were also considered [12]. there we have a

closed string tachyon which means, from the point of view of anti de sitter space-time,

that we should work in a regime where the curvature is of the order of the string scale i.e

out of the gravity approximation . using the vacuum expectation value for the tachyon

as source of the dilaton, an approximate solution with a running of the said dilaton was

obtained which is consistent with asymptotic freedom .the curvature in the ultraviolet

(uv) region being innity again indicates that the gravity description is not valid in the

uv asymptotically free regime. both in the type 0 case or in type iib with supersymmetry

broken by boundary conditions on the internal kaluza klein manifold the starting point

was the geometry as dened, in the near horizon limit, by a stack of d branes.

a dierent approach, presented in a previous paper [5], see also [2], stems from the

2

idea of using strings to model out the renormalization group equations of the quantum

eld theory. this in particular leads to associate to the coupling constants of the quantum

eld theory, some background elds of a closed string theory and to demand that the

sigma model beta functions characterizing the string background precisely coincide with the

renormalization group equations of the non abelian gauge theory. in this sense the quantum

eld theory beta functions appear as the imput in the string beta function equations.

the output, that is purely stringy, will consist in the specic space-time geometry that

will be formally dened on the space-time extended by an extra (renormalization group)

dimension. this string geometry is the one we can use to dene representations of the

vacuum expectation value of the wilson loop in terms of random surfaces, most likely with

zig-zag type of boundary conditions [19]. notice that the dierence between the d-brane

approach and the renormalization group approach (rga) lies mainly in the way the eld

theory input is introduced. in the d-brane approach this is done in terms of the low energy

physics on the d-brane. in the rga approach we use instead the quantum eld theory

beta functions to x the dilaton behavior and employ the string beta function equations

to derive the stringy space-time geometry.

the physical meaning, from the quantum eld theory point of view, of the stringy

space-time geometry is related to the renormalization group evolution of zamolodchikovs

c-function. more precisely the curvature on the renormalization group dimension will

induce a focusing phenomena with the interpretation of decreasing c-function [22].

in

summary the rga intends to translate in pure gravitational terms, codied in the string

beta function equations, the renormalization group evolution of both the gauge coupling

constant and zamolodchikovs c-function. the gravitational description of renormalization

group evolution is our way to understand the meaning of holography[2].

we want to continue in this work the study of a critical bosonic string background with

the dilaton eld dened by an asymptotically free beta function of the type of pure n = 0
yang-mills.

3

the solution presented in reference [5] is generalized in this paper to the case of two

loop yang mills beta function. the resulting conning metric posseses the same intrinsic

geometry that for the one loop case. moreover the conning geometry is universal for

arbitrary order in perturbation theory. this conning string metric is an exact solution

to the critical bosonic string sigma model beta function equations for vanishing vacuum

expectation value of the tachyon.

next we consider the problem of stability of our solution showing that on the reduced

functional space dened by demanding conservation of energy, the linearized small uctu-

ation problem does not admit normalizable solutions with negative eigenvalue. we also

study the existence of a mass gap for glueball equations as well as the area law behavior for

the vacuum expectation value of the wilson loop. in addition we present a careful analysis

of the geometry of the conning string vacuum with the expected behavior of a geometric

c-function dened in terms of the expansion for congruences of null geodesics.

2 gauge geometry

our starting point is the rg evolution for an asymptotically free pure gauge theory. for

simplicity we will rst consider the case of the one loop beta function equation:



g
d

0
(4)2 g3

= 

(1)

for  some numerical constant depending on the gauge group and g the yang mills coupling

constant. (the free abelian theory can also be put in this form, with 0 = 0). next we use

the standard relation between the gauge coupling constant and the dilaton eld:

g = e


2

(2)

in what follows we will identify the renormalization group coordinate  with a space-time

dimension. from the previous equations we derive the dependence on this coordinate of

4

the dilaton eld :

next we use, in order to x the string space-time geometry, the sigma model beta function

() =  log log() + log(0)

(3)

equations for the bosonic string:

with the constant c given by:

r   = 0

2 + ()2 = c

c =

26  d

3

(4)

(5)

(6)

to solve these equations for the asymptotically free dilaton eld we will use the following

ansatz for the metric:

ds2 = a()d~x2

d + b()d2 + c()d~y2

d

(7)

(where d~x2

n represents the ordinary minkowski metric in rn). before motivating our ansatz

for the metric let us just present the solution:

a() = log()

b() =

1
2

c() = 1

(8)

(9)

(10)

the corresponding metric is solution provided:

 the number of x coordinates , d = 4

 the string is critical i.e the number of y coordinates d = 21. and therefore the

constant c is equal zero.

 the metric is a solution with both euclidean and lorentzian signature.

5

notice also that the sigma model beta functions we have used assume already a van-

ishing vacuum expectation value for the closed string tachyon background eld.

the metric we obtain as solution to the string beta function equations with an asymp-

totically free behavior for the dilaton is of the type rst considered by polyakov [19] with

the function a() playing the role of a running inverse string tension. moreover dening

 = log() we can interpret  as the analog of liouville eld. it is important to observe

that the string beta function equations are not sensitive to the constant in equation (5) i.e

they do not feel the concrete gauge group we are working with.

next we will briey describe the dierent regions of our space-time. the region cor-

responding to ultraviolet behavior of the yang mills theory is  = . in this region the
scalar curvature that is given by:

r =

1

log()2

(11)

is small indicating that the semiclassical gravity description is valid for the weakly coupled

gauge theory. the space-time in the direction  ends at the value  = 1 where the curvature

becomes innity. this region that constitutes a naked singularity of the space-time should

corresponds to the conning scale  of the non-abelian gauge theory2.

it is interesting to notice that for this solution stringy eects become more important

once we are moving into the infrared regime. comparing with polyakovs type of metrics

we should notice that the singularity satisfy the zig-zag condition a( = 1) = 0. therefore

it would be natural to dene a string representation of wilson loops to impose dirichlet

boundary conditions on  = 1.

as mentioned in the introduction the rga to the string description of non abelian gauge

theories have as its goal to model in terms of sigma model string beta function equations

the dierent renormalization group equations of the corresponding quantum eld theory.

2in the abelian case, our solution reduces to the at one. it is a singular point in the space of all solutions,

and clearly does not describe the physics of a conformal invariant situation, known to be represented

holographically by ads5 in other contexts

6

in this sense it is of major importance to have an interpretation of the string space-time

metric in purely quantum eld theory terms. here is where the role of zamolodchikovs c

theorem becomes important. as described in reference [5] the c-theorem can be understood

as a direct consequence of gravitational focusing for congruences of null geodesics in the

renormalization group direction . therefore from the rga point of view the curvature in

the coordinate  should be intimately related with the evolution of c-function. here we will

not enter into a detailed discussion on the denition of the c-function from a geometrical

point of view reducing ourselves to discuss the phenomena of gravitational focusing for the

asymptotically free space-time metric.

2.1 two loop approximation and universal metric

let us now consider the two loop running coupling constant for pure yang mills ([18]):

g2() =

where the beta function is parametrized as:

(g)

(4)2 g3

2
2(4)6 g7

= 

(13)

the quotient 1/2

0 happens to be independent, for pure yang mills, of the particular gauge

group we are working with. (up to two loops we should neglect 2). starting with the

three loop contribution, a nontrivial dependence on the renormalization scheme appears.

the corresponding dilaton is given up to a constant by

() =  log log 2 + log [ 1

our ansatz for the conning string metric is now dictated by the one loop solution described

in the previous section, namely

(17)

it is a simple matter (with the help of some algebraic manipulation software) to check

that this metric, with the two-loop dilaton is an exact solution of the string beta function

equations, provided that d = 4.

notice that both this metric and the corresponding one loop case can be written in the

universal form:

ds2 = ed~x2

d + (de)2 + d~y2

d

(18)

with  the one given by the quantum eld theory renormalization group equation. it is

important to stress that here also ( as already did happen in the one and two loop cases) the

sigma model beta function for the dilaton  = 0 implies that the metric (15) is solution

only when we consider a four dimensional space-time and a critical string i.e d in (15)

equal 21.

at this point the reader can wonder why - if we are identifying the string coupling

constant with the yang mills coupling- we are using ,in order to match yang mills higher

loop eects, the sigma model beta function equations at string tree level. this is a very

8

deep question whose answer could be related to the fact that dilaton tadpole eects of

fischler-susskind type [13] are absorbed in renormalizations of the metric that preserve

the universal form (18).

the result we have presented for the two loop case is not accidental, in fact we can

prove the following theorem

theorem. the universal metric (18) is (for an arbitrary dilaton eld depending only

on the renormalization group variable) an exact solution to the sigma model beta function

equations for a critical string.

this means that exactly the same spacetime metric conveys quite dierent solutions,

summarizing the whole perturbative expansion of the gauge theory. a lot of physics is

hidden in the change of variables needed to put the metric in the universal form (18).

this is by itself an interesting property of the tree level sigma model beta function

equations that depends crucially on working at criticality i.e for the constant (2) vanishing.

2.2 generalities on the conning manifold

in terms of the universal metric (18) it is exceedingly convenient for most geometrical

studies to employ the variable

such that the metric reads

and the dilaton

  e

ds2 = d~x2

4 + d2

 =  log 

(19)

(20)

(21)

the natural range for  is (0,) (because there is a singularity at  = 0 (which physically
we can identify with the dynamically generated scale  of the yang mills theory). in the

one loop case  is simply given by log  and it is amusing to note that we can extend the

9

metric to the range (, 0) by means of the inversion

  1/

(22)

(that is,   ) this is a non-analytic extension, in the sense that the complete metric
would read:

and the dilaton

ds2 = ||d~x2

4 + d2

 =  log ||

(23)

(24)

this non analytic extension of the metric could be related to the existence of a deconning

phase transition.

we shall use roman capitals to denote generic ve-dimensional indices, a, b, c, . . . =
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, where x4  z; and greek letters for the ordinary four-dimensional variables, i.e.
, , . . . = 0, 1, 2, 3, whereas i, j, k, . . . = 1, 2, 3.

the isometry group of the conning manifold is just the four-dimensional poincare

group, io(1, 3). the four killings associated to four-dimensional translations are:

k  

(25)

note in particular that the contravariant components of the killing associated to time

translations are

ka  (1, 0, 0, 0, 0)

(26)

2.3 gravitational focusing

the rst ingredient we need are the null geodesics for our metric. they are given in ane

parametrization by:

x =

2c
c0 (

3c0
2

(  0) + 3/2

0 )1/3 + x

0 

2c1/2

0

c0

(27)

10

and

 = (

3c0
2

(  0 + 3/2

0 )2/3

with cc =  c0



2

.

the covariant null tangent vector is

k = c

(where c  c) and

k4 =

c0


1/2 =

c0


(

3c0
2

(  0) + 3/2

0 )1/3

the ane parameter is normalized in such a way that

the covariant derivative is given by:

kaa = 1

k =

1
4
4k = k4 = 

4k4 = 

23/2

k4

k

1
2
c0

(28)

(29)

(30)

(31)

(32)

the fact that the antisymmetric part vanishes is equivalent to the fact that the vorticity

of the corresponding congruence  = 0. this means that the congruence is hypersurface

orthogonal.

the expansion is given by

and the shear by

 =

3c0

23/2

2 = 

15c0
823

(33)

(34)

we can see directly a c-theorem of sorts operating in the conning metric: the expansion

 behaves in physical variables as

  (log )3/2

11

(35)

being  at the singularity as it should be. this means that the corresponding c-function
will also have a similar physical behavior. in fact, according [2], its behavior is roughly

like the inverse of , which would mean

c  (log )3/2

(36)

this denition, however was tailored for holographic theories, and it is conceivable that

some modications are needed in our case. it is curious ,however, to notice how easy is to

prove this sort of properties in the string representation in contradistinction to the painful

attempts to prove it directly by quantum eld theory methods [14]. clearly further research

is needed on what quantum eld theoretical correlators is the c-function measuring.

2.4 other geodesics

in order to obtain analytic expressions, it is useful to parametrize the curves in terms of the

time coordinate, t. the minkowskian space-like coordinates have always a form identical

to the one corresponding to at space geodesics, namely:

xi = xi

0 + it

(37)

(where i  ci

c0 ). let us now examine several subcases in turn.

2.4.1 null geodesics

null geodesics exist only when ~2  2  1 (that is, when the minkowskian projection is
timelike). its explicit form in our present parametrization is:

when ~2 < 1, and

when ~2 = 1.

 =

1  2

4

(t  t0)2

 = 0

12

(38)

(39)

2.4.2 timelike geodesics

timelike geodesics also need ~2 < 1. the explicit expression is

 =

(c0)2

2

(1  2)(1 + sin

t  t0
c0p1  2

)

(40)

it is remarkable that this implies the existence of closed timelike geodesics; for example,

when i = 0:

xi = xi
0
(c0)2
22 (1 + sin

 =

(t  t0)

c0

)

(41)

the physical meaning of ve-dimensional timelike geodesics is related to unsuspected prop-

erties of the renormalization group ow, worth examining in some detail. we stress once

more that the ordinary four dimensional projection never suers from closed timelike

curves; they close in the coordinate associated to the renormalization group evolution

parameter only.

2.4.3 spacelike geodesics

spacelike geodesics appear for any value of . when  6= 0,
t  t0
c0p1  2

 = (c0)2(1  2) cosh2

and when  = 1,

 = 0  t

3 energy functional

(42)

(43)

since we are considering a background for the critical bosonic string an issue we should

address is the fate of tachyons on this particular space-time. here we will follow the

approach of [7] extended from the case of anti-de-sitter (ads) to our conning metric. let

13

us rst recall the ads argument. we consider the case of a free scalar eld of mass m2. next

conservation of the energy momentum tensor is enforced. this implies certain boundary

conditions on the the elds at the boundary. finally we solve the eld equations on the

functional space satisfaying these boundary conditions. for stationary wave solutions this

amounts to a bound on allowed values for the mass m2. certain negative values of m2 are

allowed by this bound corresponding to tachyons with compton wavelength of the order of

ads curvature radius. however uctuations corresponding to these tachyons have positive

total energy impliying the stability of ads space-time. in the ads case the cauchy problem

on the reduced functional space, determined by the condition of energy conservation, has a

unique solution. in order to extend the previous analysis to our case the rst thing we will

do is to derive the boundary conditions on the wave functions required by conservation of

energy.

given an arbitrary scalar eld dened on the conning manifold with energy-momentum

tensor tab, there is a killing energy current, namely

which is covariantly conserved, 3 i.e.

ja  t abkb

aja = 0

(44)

(46)

applying stokestheorem to the integral over the ve-dimensional region r delimited by
the hypersurfaces t = t0 and t = t1, of the ve-form proportional to the rst member of
(46), i.e. of d  j, where j is the one-form dual to the current, j  jadxa, we get

0 = zm

d  j = zm j = e(t2)  e(t1) + e

3 please note that we need at least two scalar elds to build a conserved number current, namely

n a  e(2a1  1a2)

14

(47)

(45)

where

e(t)  z d3xdzj0(t, xi, z)

and the ux over the boundary at innity

e = lim

(xi,z)z [(ijkdt  dxj  dxk  dz)ji + d4xj4]

only when the physical boundary conditions are such that

there is actual energy conservation,

e = 0

de
dt

= 0

for a scalar eld of mass m it is readily found that

tab =

1
2

e[ab 

1
2

gab(gcdcd  m22)]

so that the ve dimensional energy is:

e[] 

1

4 z d3xdz[ 2 + ()2 + z(m22 + ()2]

(48)

(49)

(50)

(51)

(52)

(53)

in the free case the energy is zero on shell, provided the elds vanish at innity fast enough,

and this is true no matter what the sign of m2 is, i.e., even for the putative tachyon.

3.1 variations of the energy functional

because we are mostly interested in the stability of our solution we will reduce ourselves

to study the spectral problem for the operator dened by the second variation of the

energy around t = 0 corresponding to vanishing tachyonic background. we will use static

uctuations. notice that the rst static variation of the energy is zero since we are working

with a solution of the equations of motion.

the second variation can actually be written in our case as:

2e[]

2 = 2z d3xdz[3 + l]

15

(54)

where l is the operator:

l = z

d2
dz2 

d
dz

+ zm2

(55)

the issue as to the stability of the solution is then equivalent to the issue of whether the

operator l has any negative eigenvalues (on the functional space in which all conservation

laws can be actually implemented).we are then led to study the eigenvalue problem

lt = t

(56)

this is a second order ordinary dierential equation, with a regular singular point at the

origin and an irregular one at innity. by studying the inditial equation it is inmediatly

obvious that one of the solutions has a logarithmic singularity at the origin.

in order to be able to study simultaneously the two cases of positive and negative mass
square we shall for the latter use m2  2. by performing the change of both dependent
and independent variables:

t (z) = ezy(z/)

(57)

(where 2 = m2 and 2 = 1), the equation is reduced to a conuent hypergeometric one:

d2y
dx2 + (

1
x  1)

dy
dx

+ (


2m 

1
2

)

1
x

y = 0

(58)

let is dene a  m
with p  z+), where the solution is given in terms of laguerre polynomials,

2m . there is an exceptional case, when a  n (that is,  = (2p + 1)m,

y = l(0)

n (x)

(59)

otherwise the two independent solutions are given in terms of the functions ([10]) (a, 1, x)

and (a, 1, x),

the function (a, 1, x) is regular at the origin

(a, 1, x)  1f1(a, 1, x) x0 1 + ax + . . .

and at innity behaves as

(a, 1, x) x

1

(a)

exxa1

16

(60)

(61)

on the other hand the function (a, 1, x) has got a logarithmic divergence at the origin

(a, 1, x) x0 

1

(a)

log[x] + . . .

whereas at innity behaves as

(a, 1, x) x xa

(62)

(63)

when m2 > 0 the only solution regular at the origin is ne. we can arrange our variables

in such a way that asymptotically

t (z) x emz(2mz)a1

this means that the solutions and their derivatives are square integrable on dz.

when m2 < 0, however, the asymptotic behaviour of the putative solution is

t  eiz(2iz)a1

(64)

(65)

(where a = 1

2 + i

2 ), too slow to be convergent, for any value of .

thus we can conclude that there is not any negative eigenvalue -even in the tachyonic

case m2 < 0- with normalizable wave function. in other words on the functional space

dened by the boundary conditions required by energy conservation the operator l has

not any negative eigenvalue , which we interpret as a strong indication of the stability of

our conning metric. comparing with the bound in [7] we observe that for normalizable
static wave functions the mass m2 is forced to be  0. the extension of the previous
anlysis to stationary wave functions does not change the result.

it is is illustrative to present the previous analysis from the point of view of an equivalent

schrodinger problem. in order to do that let us perform the change of variables in equation

(56)

and the equation reduces to

an equation rst studied by whittaker, which is an schrodinger equation for the reduced

potential

and reduced energy

u(z) = 

1 + 4z

4z2

 = m2

(68)

(69)

please note that now we are viewing the problem head down: we are assuming we already

know , and we look for the energy as an eigenvalue. the potential starts at u = 
at z = 0 can become positive if  is negative enough,and reaches u+ = 0 at z = , but
not faster than 1/z (which is a necessary condition for most inverse stattering theorems to

hold)

again, for m2 > 0, we need the potential to have a negative eigenvalue, which is no

problem (there is indeed a continuum spectrum   (0,)).

for m2 < 0, we would need a positive energy , which is not possible with normalizable

states, owing to the slow asymptotic behaviour of the potential at innity.

the massless case is marginal.

4 the propagation of scalar disturbances

from a practical point of view the main utility of a conning string representation of a

non-abelian gauge theory ought to be the computation of the glueball spectrum (which is

in principle measurable, although the widths are quite big, and the mixing with q q states

is important).

the main tool in this computation is a calculation of two wilson loops correlator,

< w (c)w (c ) >

(70)

which conveys the desired information in the location of its poles. while we certainly

plan to perform this computation in the near future, we would like here to examine a

18

very preliminary aspect of this problem, namely the semiclassical propagation of a scalar

disturbance in the conning metric (which could be a crude model of the 0++ glueball).

we shall consider elds in the four-dimensional momentum representation, i.e.

(x, z)  z d4keik.x(k, z)

(71)

the wave equation for massless (in the ve dimensional sense) scalar disturbances is then

z

d2
dz2 +

d
dz

= k2

(72)

it is plain to check that there are no normalizable solutions when k2 = 0 (which corresponds

to the massless case from the four-dimensional point of view).actually, the general solution

is then

(k2 = 0, z) = c1 log z + c2

(73)

this is enough to stablish the existence of a mass gap, in the sense that massless distur-

bances from the ve-dimensional sense neccessarily correspond to massive ones from the

four-dimensional one.

when k2 6= 0 the solution is easily expressed in terms of bessel functions;

(k, z) = b0(2kz)

(74)

where b0(x) represents a bessel function; actually a linear combination of the functions

j0(x) and y0(x) when k2 < 0 (in this case, the argument in the function should be

2k2z) , and a linear combination of the modied functions i0(x) and k0(x) when

k2 > 0.

in the former case there are no normalizable solutions (in accordance with the results

in the last paragraph). physically, this means that there are no four-dimensional tachyons

propagating. in the latter, normalizability again uniquely selects the k0 solution.

normalization now means, for example, that

z 

0

(z)2dz = 1

19

(75)

but this integral is easily shown to be equivalent to

z 

0

k 2

0 zdz = 2k2 =

(76)

enforcing a discrete four dimensional mass spectrum, namely m2

4 = 1

4. energy is of course

measured in units of , so that this gives

m =


2

.

(77)

this value seems a bit low, 4but of course this is only but a crude estimate and we do not

want to push it too far.

5 the wilson loop and the soft dilaton theorem

an important test of any conning string model is to produce an area law behavior for

the vacuum expectation value of the static wilson loop, which we shall take in the static

gauge

x0 = 

x1 = 

(78)

and the world sheet of the conning string will be characterized by the time translation of

the prole

 = ()

(79)

with (l/2) = 0. once we have a string model of a pure gauge theory we should represent
the vacuum expectation value for the wilson loop as a sum over random surfaces with

4 experimentally the situation is unclear; although in [18] several candidates are reported, notably

the f0(1500). in [11] evidence is reported for a pomeron trajectory p (t) = p (0) + 

p t, with p (0) =

1.08gev and 

p = 0.25gev 2. the stardard lattice value (which seems to be a decreasing function of

the n factor in the gauge group su (n )), is about m  3.64  2.18gev [20]. in order to compare with
the string value, an extrapolation towards n =  ought to be made.

20

xed boundary as dened by the loop. in the semiclassical approximation we can use the

corresponding nambu-goto form of the string action and to look for the minimal area

surface bounded by the loop [17].

for the conning string metric the nambu goto action is given by:

s =

1

2 z p((x)2 + )

(80)

where by simplicity we use a static loop with prole given in terms of the function (x).

denoting 0 the minimun value of (x) at the symmetric point x = 0 it is easy to see that

this valu depends on l ,the spatial length of the loop, as 0  l2.

if we use in the nambu goto action a constant value for the string tension  the

potential energy in this semiclassical approximation will go as:

v (l)  l3

(81)

which means overconning.it is important to stress that this result is generic for our metric

independently if we locate the loop at  = 0 or at  = inf ty. the only dierence is that

when located in the zig-zag hyperplane  = 0 the minimal surface will live in the non

analytic extension of the space corresponding to negative values of  ( i.e to values of 

between zero and one ).

an important theorem for the bosonic string is the so called soft dilaton theorem that

stablish the following interesting relation between the string coupling constant and the

string tension:

limk0a(k; p1, p2, ...pn) = cg(



)

(d2)

2

(

 
 

1
2

(d  2)g


g

)a(p1, p2, ...pn)

(82)

where a(k; p1, p2, ...pn) is the amplitude for a soft dilaton insertion of momentum k and n

external gluon vertex operators with momentum (p1, p2, ...pn). if now we identify the open

string coupling constant g with the yang mills coupling, something that we have done along

our construction them the soft dilaton theorem [1] will implies that if g is running with

21

the renormalization group parameter  them 

(d2)

2

should change with  in precisely

the opposite way. notice also that in the soft dilaton theorem expression we must consider

the momentum (p1, p2, ...pn) living in the four dimensional physical space-time. this is

necessary in order to be consistent with our identication of the string coupling constant

with the gauge coupling thus we will take d = 4.

the way we will use now the soft dilaton theorem is by simply changing the string

tension in the nambu-goto action by the eective running string tension dictated by the

soft dilaton theorem relation between the scaling of g and . in these conditions we get:

s =

1

2 z p1((x)2 + )

it is now plain to see that the potential energy in this case goes like

v (l)  l

(83)

(84)

i.e as the area law. the reader can wonder what will happen if instead of taking d = 4

in the soft dilaton theorem we leave free this value. the potential we will get is given in

terms of d as

v (l)  l5d

(85)

producing the area law only in the four dimensional case.

the reader should notice that the wilson loop is ,properly speaking, the rst string

computation we are performing. before we were considering semiclassical gravity eects

associated with our conning string metric. very likely the way the soft dilaton theorem

enters into de computation of the wilson loop is related to loop equations understood as

renormalization group equations for the vacuum expectation value of the wilson loop. it

is also important to stress that the soft dilaton theorem enssures the area law behavior for

the universal conning metric (18) whatever the loop order of the yang mills beta function

we choose to x the dilaton running.

22

there is still a problem we have not touched along our paper, that can be relevant for our

discussion of the wilson loop computation, namely the dynamical role of the 21 spactator

extra coordinates we need to add in order to nd solution to the sigma model beta function

equations. we have not a denitive answer to this issue although we feel very meaningful

the fact that our solution make it compelling to work in a critical string framework. (

incidentally notice that this would be also the case even in the type 0 strings setup with

world sheet supersymmetry ). a potential way to interpret these extra spectators is to work

in non critical dimension with an appropiate vacuum expectation value for the tachyon.

in this case, and in order to solve the tachyon beta function equation we need to invoke

some mechanism of the type described in reference ([12]) for the generation of a tachyon

potential v (t ) such that mt0 + v (t0) = 0 where t0 is the required tachyon vacuum

expectation value. in spite of the fact that this can be an interesting mechanism to avoid

the presence of extra spectators we insist, until reaching a deeper understanding on the

meaning of criticality, on the beauty of having an exact string solution with a running

dilaton consistent with higher order eects in quantum eld perturbation theory.
