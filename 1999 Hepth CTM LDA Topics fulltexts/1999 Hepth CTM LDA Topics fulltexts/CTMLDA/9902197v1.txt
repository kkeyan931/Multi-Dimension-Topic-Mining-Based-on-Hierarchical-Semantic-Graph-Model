abstract

we study baryon congurations in large n non-supersymmetric su(n) gauge theo-
ries, applying the ads/cft correspondence. using the d5-brane worldvolume theory
in the near-horizon geometry of non-extremal d3-branes, we nd embeddings which de-
scribe baryonic states in three-dimensional qcd. in particular, we construct solutions
corresponding to a baryon made of n quarks, and study what happens when some
fraction  of the total number of quarks are bodily moved to a large spatial separation
from the others. the individual clumps of quarks are represented by born-infeld string
tubes obtained from a d5-brane whose spatial section has topology r  s4. they are
connected by a conning color ux tube, described by a portion of the vebrane that
runs very close and parallel to the horizon. we nd that this ux tube has a tension
with a nontrivial -dependence (not previously obtained by other methods). a similar
picture is presented for the four-dimensional case.

1 introduction

the born-infeld action plus an appropriate wess-zumino term denes a worldvolume
theory for d-branes which has proved to be a powerful way to describe these objects and
their excitations. in the context of maldacenas correspondence between supergravity
in anti-de sitter (ads) space and certain gauge theories [1, 2, 3], there are gauge
theory questions which can be answered by the study of branes extended in curved
space.
in particular, it was shown in a general way that the large-nc dynamics of
baryons can be related to the behavior of d5-branes extended in ads space [4, 5].
concrete realizations of this possiblity in the context of the non-conning n = 4
supersymmetric gauge theory have been worked out in [6, 7] using the born-infeld
approach for constructing strings out of d-branes [8, 9]. in this paper, we will look at
how these constructions work in the more complicated spacetimes that correspond to
various conning gauge theories. we will examine conning forces by looking at what
happens to baryons when they are pulled apart into their quark constituents. this will
be compared to (and yields somewhat more information than) the study of conning
forces via simple strings that hang into the ads geometry from a boundary wilson
loop [10, 11, 5].

in this paper, we extend our previous work [6] on d5-branes in extremal back-
ground in three ways. first, we will study non-extremal supergravity backgrounds,
corresponding to gauge theories dimensionally reduced in a way that breaks supersym-
metry. second, we allow the brane congurations to have extension in the spacetime
coordinates of the gauge-theory instead of being localized at a point. this will allow
us to describe a baryon which is being pulled apart into quark constituents. third,
we discuss also the case based on d4-branes, which corresponds to a gauge theory in
four dimensions.

we start out in section 2 by analysing baryons in a (2+1)-dimensional su(n) yang-
mills theory which is obtained from (3+1)-dimensions by compactifying on a super-
symmetry breaking circle. as proposed in [12], this gauge theory is dual to a certain
non-extremal d3-brane geometry5 and, following [6], we study solutions of the d5-
brane worldvolume equations of motion in that geometry. we nd a class of solutions
that are localized in the gauge theory spatial coordinates and appear to describe the
baryon. unlike the baryons constructed in the extremal background [6, 7], these solu-
tions have no moduli since the quarks are truly bound in the baryon. we then study a
new class of solutions in which the n quarks are separated into two groups, containing
n and (1  )n quarks respectively, separated by a spatial distance l in the gauge
theory. the l-dependence of the energy of these solutions is consistent with conne-

non-supersymmetric yang-mills theories.

ment and the implied color ux tube tension has a non-trivial dependence on the color
charge .

in section 3 we carry out the same analysis for the gauge theory in one more dimen-
sion, i.e., d4-branes embedded in a non-extremal d4-brane geometry. we include also
a short section on the extremal limit, as this was not covered in [6]. the analysis is
parallel to the one in section 2, with the added surprise that the resulting color ux
tension now has a very simple dependence on .

in a nal section we summarize our results and discuss future directions.

2 the baryon in three dimensions

2.1 worldvolume action and equations of motion

we derive the equations for a d5-brane embedded in the near-horizon geometry of n
nonextremal d3-branes. the euclidean background metric is

r(cid:19)2
ds2 = (cid:18) r
f (r) = 1  r4

4,

f (r)1dr2 + r2d2
5,

(1)

rh = r2t,

where {, x||} = {, x, y, z} denote the directions parallel to the threebranes. the
coordinate  is periodic, with period 1/t , where t is the hawking temperature. the
relation between the horizon radius rh and t ensures smoothness of the geometry at
r = rh.

under the ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3], type iib string theory on a background
with the above metric, a constant dilaton, and n units of veform ux through the
ve-sphere, is dual to n = 4, d = 3 + 1 su(n) sym theory at temperature t ,
with coupling g2
y m4 = 2gs. the gauge theory coordinates are {x, y, z, }. for large
t the  circle becomes small and one eectively obtains a description of a strongly-
coupled (coupling g2
y m4t ) three-dimensional euclidean gauge theory at zero
temperature. the thermal boundary conditions on the circle break supersymmetry
and the fermions and scalars acquire masses of order t and g2
y m4t , respectively. the
eective three-dimensional theory is expected to display behavior similar to that of
non-supersymmetric pure yang-mills theory, qcd3 [12].

y m3 = g2

a baryon (a bound state of n external quarks) in the three-dimensional theory has
as its string theory counterpart a vebrane wrapped on an s5 on which n fundamental
strings terminate [4, 5]. the vebrane worldvolume action is

s = t5z d6qdet(g + f ) + t5z a(1)  g(5) ,

2

6) is the brane tension. the born-infeld term involves the
where t5 = 1/(gs(2)5ls
induced metric g and the u(1) worldvolume eld strength f(2) = da(1). the second
term is the wess-zumino coupling of the worldvolume gauge eld a(1) to (the pullback
of) the background ve-form eld strength g(5), which eectively endows the vebrane
with a u(1) charge proportional to the s5 solid angle that it spans.

for a static baryon we need a conguration invariant under translations in the gauge
theory time direction, which we take to be y. we use y and the s5 spherical coordinates
as worldvolume coordinates for the vebrane,  = (y, ). for simplicity we restrict
our attention to so(5) symmetric congurations of the form r(), x(), and ay()
(with all other elds set to zero), where  is the polar angle in spherical coordinates.
the action then simplies to

s = t54r4z dy d sin4 {qr2 + r2/f (r) + (r/r)4x2  f 2

y + 4ay},

(2)

where 4 = 82/3 is the volume of the unit four-sphere.

the gauge eld equation of motion following from this action reads

d() = 4 sin4 ,

where the dimensionless displacement d is the variation of the action with respect to
e = fy. the solution to this equation is

d() = (cid:20) 3

2

(  ) +

3
2

sin  cos  + sin3  cos (cid:21) .

(3)

as will be explained below, the integration constant 0    1 controls the number
of born-infeld strings emerging from each pole of the s5. next, it is convenient to
eliminate the gauge eld in favor of d and legendre transform the original lagrangian
to obtain an energy functional of the embedding coordinate r() only:

u = t54r4z dqr2 + r2/f (r) + (r/r)4x2qd()2 + sin8  .

(4)

this action has the interesting scaling property that if {r(), x()} is a solution for
horizon radius rh, then {r(), 1x()} is a solution for horizon radius rh. the
scaling x  r2/r is precisely as expected from the holographic uv/ir relation [16, 17].
we will have more to say about scaling behavior of solutions later on.

the vebrane embeddings of interest to us will have singularities: places on the
ve-sphere (typically    or 0) where r   and x  0. as in [6, 8, 9], these
spikes must be interpreted as bundles of fundamental strings attached to the wrapped
vebrane and localized at some denite value of x.
it can be seen from (4) that a
spike sticking out at  =  has a tension (energy per unit radial coordinate distance)

3

t54r4|d()|f (r)1/2 = (1)ntf f (r)1/2, which is precisely the tension of (1)n
fundamental strings in this geometry. a spike at  = 0 has the same tension as n
strings so that, taken together, the two singularities represent a total of n fundamental
strings, as expected. surfaces with more singularities and less symmetry are perfectly
possible, but a lot harder to analyze. to keep things manageable, we have built so(5)
symmetry into the ansatz.

in the extremal case (rh = 0) discussed in [6], the bps condition provided a rst
integral which greatly simplied the analysis.
in the nonextremal case we are now
discussing, there is no such rst integral and we have to deal with the unpleasant
second order euler-lagrange equation that follows from (4). this is most conveniently
done in a parametric hamiltonian formalism 6. first we rewrite the energy in terms of
a general worldvolume parameter s with the d5-brane embedding dened by functions
 = (s), r = r(s), x = x(s):

u = t54r4z dsqr2 2 + r2/f + (r/r)4 x2 qd2 + sin8 ,

(5)

where dots denote derivatives with respect to s. the momenta conjugate to r,  and
x are

pr = f 1 r,

p = r2 ,

px = (r/r)4 x,  =

.

(6)

d2 + sin8 

qr2 2 + r2/f + (r/r)4 x2

the hamiltonian that follows from the action (5) vanishes identically due to reparametriza-
tion invariance in s. furthermore, the momentum expressions are non-invertible and
the system is subject to the constraint

x (cid:16)d2 + sin8 (cid:17) = 0 .

(7)

this constraint can be taken as the hamiltonian and this choice conveniently xes the
gauge, while getting rid of the complicated square-root structure of the action. the
equations of motion that follow from this hamiltonian are

(8)

together with initial conditions, these equations completely dene the solutions for the
vebrane. the initial conditions should be chosen such that h = 0.

6we would like to thank g. savvidy for suggesting and helping to realize this approach.

4

to gain some insight into the solutions to these equations, notice that the basic
problem to solve is a motion in the two-dimensional r   plane: the motion in x is
then determined by the choice of a conserved value for px. note that for px = 0, the
surface sits at a xed value of x and therefore has no spatial extension in the gauge
theory coordinates: we will call this a point solution. when r is large compared to

rh and rpx, the r   motion is simply that of a particle of unit mass moving in
two dimensions under the inuence of the angular potential v () = hd()2 + sin8 i.

by the constraint, the energy of this ctitious particle vanishes. for generic , the
potential has three extrema (see figure 1): two minima at  = 0 and  = , and a
maximum at  = c such that  = c  sin c cos c. for large r the particle will thus
roll down towards one of the two minima. whether it reaches  = 0,  at a nite value
of r depends on the initial boundary conditions.

2.2 the point baryon

in this section we study solutions which correspond to a baryon localized at a particular
gauge theory position. to localize the surface in x, we just set px = 0. with the
symmetry that we have built in, the equations of motion typically allow the surface to
run o to r =  at  =  or 0. at least asymptotically, such spikes are equivalent
to bundles of fundamental strings and will be identied with the quark constituents
of the state represented by the wrapped vebrane. to get a baryon whose component
quarks have identical su(4) (avor) quantum numbers, we want a spike representing
n quarks to emerge from one pole of the s5 (say  = ) with a smooth surface at the
other pole. to meet the rst condition, it suces to set the integration constant  = 0
and to meet the second, we impose smooth boundary conditions (r = 0 and r = r0)
at  = 0.7

numerical integration with these boundary conditions yields a one-parameter family
of solutions (parametrized by r0). due to the scaling mentioned before, the solutions

7this is equivalent to requiring pr = 0 at  = 0, in which case p must also vanish to satisfy the

constraint (7).

conguration is a tube with r0  .

really only depend on rh through the ratio  = r0/rh  1. figure 2 shows polar plots8
of the solutions for a few representative values of . when  < crit  9 the solution
tilts toward and eventually crosses the symmetry axis, thus reaching  =  at a nite
value of r. as   1 (i.e. as the starting radius gets closer and closer to the horizon),
the brane becomes more and more spherical (notice that r() = rh is a solution to the
equations of motion). for  > crit, on the other hand, the solution tilts away from the
symmetry axis, reaching  =  only at r = . as  increases the solution looks more
and more like a tube. this is simply a consequence of the fact that, for large , the
solution is always very far from the horizon, and is well-approximated by an extremal
embedding (discussed in [6]). when    the conguration becomes a bps tube
[6] with innite radius.

the cusp in the  < crit solutions indicates the presence of a delta-function source
in the equations of motion. since the compactly wrapped brane intercepts n units of
ve-form ux, it has n units of worldbrane u(1) charge and must have n fundamental
strings attached to it [4]. this is most simply achieved by taking the cusp as the
point of attachment of n fundamental strings, running along the ray  = .
in
accordance with the born-infeld string philosophy [8, 9], these strings are equivalent
to a d5-brane wrapped on an s4 of vanishing volume which carries the u(1) ux out
to innity. a simple modication of the at space argument [18, 8, 9] shows that
such a collapsed vebrane is a solution to the equations of motion and has tension
ntf f (r)1/2 (exactly the tension exerted by a fundamental string of intrinsic tension
tf in this curved space).

the entire vebrane-string (or collapsed brane) system will be stable only if there is
tension balance between its two components. to obtain the stability condition, let rc

should bear in mind that they are a bit misleading as to the intrinsic geometry, since the radius of
the s5 is r, independent of r.

denote the location of the cusp (which is a function of r0), and parametrize the family
of vebrane embeddings as r = r(; rc). under the variation rc  rc + rc, it can
be seen from (4), after an integration by parts and application of the euler-lagrange
equation, that the energy of the brane changes only by a surface term,

where r
c = r|=, and we have used the fact that r(; rc) = rc. the numerator in the
last expression of (9) is the tension at r = rc of n fundamental strings, so it is clear
that the brane has a lower tension for any rc > rh. the energy is lowered by expanding
the vebrane and shortening the explicit fundamental string. a similar variational
calculation applied to the  > crit congurations (cut o at a large r = rmax) shows
that the bps tube at innity is the lowest energy solution. this is consistent with
the results of [19, 20], where the baryon was examined using the pure nambu-goto
action for the vebrane wrapped on a sphere. we emphasize that the above variational
calculation used solutions of the full born-infeld (plus wess-zumino) action.

altogether, then, the solutions depicted in fig. 2 provide a physically satisfying
picture of the process through which the n fundamental strings deform the initially
spherical vebrane, pulling it out to innity. the nal conguration has the shape of
a tube, just like the bps embeddings found in [7, 6]. in the supersymmetric case, r0
was a modulus and the energy of the baryon was independent of the overall scale of
the solution. in the nonextremal case examined here, however, there appears to be a
potential for that modulus which drives the stable solution out to r0  .

the dependence of the vebrane embedding on the s5 coordinates encodes the avor
structure (i.e., the su(4) quantum numbers) of the gauge theory state under consid-
eration. as a result of the uv/ir relation, the ads radial coordinate r is associated
with an energy scale in the gauge theory, e = r/r2 [16, 17]. the embedding r()
consequently associates a particular value of  to each dierent distance scale, yielding
some sort of su(4) wavefunction for the baryon. the so(5) symmetry of the embed-
ding translates into the statement that the baryon is a singlet under the corresponding
su(4) subgroup. finally, the fact that a given surface spans the range r  r0 implies
that the dual gauge theory conguration has structure on all length scales from zero
up to a characteristic size r2/r0. since the energetically preferred conguration has
r0  , it is in this sense truly pointlike.

7

2.3 the split baryon: color dependence of the string ten-

sion

we now turn our attention to solutions with px 6= 0 (i.e. x
6= 0). they describe
collections of quarks at nite separation in the gauge theory position space and are of
interest for exploring connement issues. it turns out to be rather easy to construct a
surface describing an su(n) baryon split into two distinct groups, containing n and
(1  )n quarks respectively and separated by a distance l in the x direction. in a
conning su(n) gauge theory, two such quark bundles should be connected by a color
ux tube and we will study the born-infeld representation of this phenomenon. each
group of quarks corresponds as before to a bundle of born-infeld strings, realized in
our approach as a singular spike or vebrane tube with topology r  s4. remember
that we have assumed an so(5)-symmetric conguration, which means that the two
singularities representing the quarks must be located at opposite poles of the s5 (we
will put them at  = 0 and  = ) with corresponding implications about the su(4)
avor structure of the states we are constructing. more general avor structures are
possible, but we will not try to study these more complicated surfaces. for large spatial
separation l = |x()x()|, the portion of the vebrane that interpolates between
the two string bundles runs close to the horizon and it is this part of the surface that
encodes the conning ux tube of the gauge theory. the surface equations (8) imply
that the part of the surface that has large spatial extent must sit at a constant  = c
where p = 0. more precisely, it has to sit at the solution of

 = c  sin c cos c .

(10)

corresponding to the unstable maximum of the potential v () discussed at the end
of section 2.1. the critical angle is a monotonic function of , such that c(0) = 0
and c() =   c(1  ). the energetics of the part of the vebrane that encodes
the conning ux tube will depend on c, and therefore , in a way that we will now
examine in some detail.

unfortunately, we must resort to numerical analysis to construct specic surfaces
of this kind. it is convenient to take the point of closest approach to the horizon as
the starting point for the numerical integration. we start the integration o with the
initial conditions

r(0) = rh +  , pr(0) = 0 ,
(0) = c ,
p(0) =  ,
x(0) = 0 ,

px(0) = (r(0)/r)2qsin6 c  (/r(0))2 .

(11)

the distance from the horizon at the point of closest approach is controlled by . for
a given , we have to shoot in  until we get satisfactory behavior of the quark-like

8

singularities at   0 and    (see section 2.2 for details). indeed, it is natural to
require asymptotically bps behavior in the region of space where supersymmetry is
recovered locally (i.e., far from the horizon). once that is done,  controls the spatial
separation of the two separated quark bundles. figs. 3 and 4 depict a typical vebrane
embedding obtained by numerical integration, for the case  = 0.9 . it can be seen in
fig. 3 that the brane extends in the x direction mostly in its ux tube portion, at
 = c and r  rh. the born-infeld string tubes corresponding to the two groups of
quarks lie essentially at a constant value of x.

figure 3: the three-dimensional projection of the d5-brane. every point on the curve is an
s4. one can clearly see how the brane drops down towards the horizon, extends horizontally
along it, and nally leaves at the other end. from the point of view of the three-dimensional
su (n ) gauge theory, which lives in the {x, y, z} directions, this conguration represents a
baryon split into two groups of n and (1 )n quarks (the vertical segments  see fig. 4),
connected by a ux tube extending a nite distance along the x direction.

it is seen from the equation for r in (8) that, for the portion of the brane running
close to the horizon, r(s)  rh grows as an exponential in the parameter s, with an
exponent proportional to pr. the latter reaches a value close to (r/rh)px (see the
equation for pr). the equation for x then shows that the separation l between the
quarks increases only logarithmically with , the minimal distance to the horizon. in
fact, there exists a limiting solution which consists of n quarks with a ux tube that
extends to innity, and the brane approaches the horizon exponentially with distance.
from the above discussion it is clear that for large quark separation l the (renormal-
ized) energy will receive its main contribution from the ux tube, and will consequently

depend linearly on l, a clear indication of connement. it is easy to compute the ten-
sion (energy per unit distance in x) of the color ux tube. note that when the vebrane
runs parallel and close to the horizon, the energy function (4) reduces to

where the last expression is given solely in terms of parameters of the gauge theory in
three dimensions. since it is obtained by dimensional reduction from four dimensions,
this theory should be understood to have an ultraviolet cuto proportional to the
hawking temperature t . the dependence of the tension on t , n, and the t hooft
coupling 3 = g2

figure 5: the tension of the ux tube (normalized to unity at its peak) as a function of ,
the fraction of quarks pulled apart. in the full theory  should be quantized in units of 1/n .
see text for discussion.

let us discuss the features of the ux tube tension seen in fig. 5. as one might
expect, the tension increases linearly for small . this means that for each additional
quark removed the work done is approximately constant. also as expected, in ex-
pression (12) there is a complete symmetry between  and 1  , (i.e., it makes no
dierence whether n or nn quarks are pulled out). thus, the tension has a maximum
at  = 1/2 and comes back down to zero near  = 1. in gauge theory language, the
at part of the curve means that it does not cost any energy to move the quark from
one bundle with  n/2 quarks to the other.

notice from equation (10) that sin3 c  3/2 for small . this implies that
3( = 1/n) becomes independent of n in the t hooft limit n   with 3 xed.
this result has a natural gauge theory interpretation. when one quark is pulled out
from the su(n) baryon (a color-singlet), the remaining n  1 must be in the anti-
fundamental representation of the gauge group. the ux tube extending between this
bundle and the solitary quark should then have the same properties as the standard
qcd string which connects a quark and an antiquark. in particular, its tension should
depend on n only through the t hooft coupling, as we have found. as a matter of fact,
for  = 1/n  1 equation (12) precisely agrees with the quark-antiquark string tension
which follows from a nambu-goto string calculation [11]. more generally, for  = n/n,
with n xed as n  , expression (12) reduces to the tension of n quark-antiquark
strings.

it is important to note that, as has been pointed out by various authors, the gauge

11

theory under study here is not strictly three-dimensional [11, 5]. the energy scale
associated with the qcd string tension, for instance, is proportional to 1/4
4 t , where
4 = g2
y m4n. this is much larger than the compactication scale t in the large 4
regime where the supergravity approximation is appropriate.

3 the baryon in four dimensions

we are of course in principle more interested in baryons in four-dimensional gauge
theories. one way of getting at this problem is via the dynamics of a d4-brane embed-
ded in the background of a large number, n, of nonextremal d4-branes [5, 19]. the
argument is completely analogous to the d5-brane in a multiple d3-brane background
that has been analysed in previous sections.

where {, x||} = {, x, y, z, w} denote the directions parallel to the four-branes. the
hawking temperature t is also the inverse period of the euclidean coordinate  . the
string coupling constant is determined by the dilaton in the original asymptotically at
region, gs = e. the iia supergravity solution (13) can only be trusted in the region
where both the curvature in string units and the dilaton are small,

(14)

type iia string theory on this background (which can be understood as a compact-
ication of an m5-brane system) is dual to d = 4 + 1 su(n) sym theory (the infrared
limit of the (0,2) theory on a circle) at temperature t , with coupling g2
y m5 = (2)2gsls
[21]. the gauge theory coordinates are {x, y, z, w, }. for large t the  circle becomes
small and the theory is eectively a strongly-coupled four-dimensional euclidean gauge
theory at zero temperature, with coupling g2
y m5t , expected to display behavior
similar to that of non-supersymmetric pure yang-mills theory, qcd4 [12, 5].

y m4 = g2

the baryon in the four-dimensional theory is dual to a string theory fourbrane on
which n fundamental strings terminate [4, 5]. the worldvolume action for the four-
brane is

s = t4z d5e qdet(g + f ) + t4z a(1)  g(4) ,

5) is the brane tension, and  =   . the wess-zumino
where t4 = 1/(gs(2)4ls
term couples the worldvolume gauge eld a(1) to (the pullback of) the dual of the
background six-form eld strength g(6).

we assume a static (i.e. y-invariant) so(4) symmetric conguration of the form r(),
x() and ay() (with  the polar angle of the s4). using the explicit background (13)
one can rewrite the lagrangian (with a sign switch) in the form

u = t43r3z dqr2 + f (r)1r2 + (r/r)3x2qd2 + sin6  ,

(15)

where the displacement d now satises the equation

and is consequently given by

d = 3 sin3 ,

d() = 3 cos   cos3   2 + 4 .

(16)

the constant of integration has been written again in terms of a parameter 0    1,
which controls the number of born-infeld strings emerging from the d4-brane at each
pole of the s4. for a given , it is easy to verify from (15) that the spikes at  = 
and  = 0 will have the same asymptotic tension as (1  )n and n fundamental
strings, respectively.
it is clear then that  is quantized in units of 1/n in the full
theory.

from (15) it is seen that if {r(), x()} is a solution for horizon radius rh, then
{r(), 1/2x()} is a solution for horizon radius rh. notice that this diers in
functional form from what was seen in section 2.1. the scaling x  r3/2/r1/2 is
precisely the holographic scaling expected from the uv/ir relation in the near-horizon
d4-brane background [17].

after repeating essentially the same routine as in the threebrane case, switching to
the parametric representation r = r(s), x = x(s),  = (s) one nds the constraint
hamiltonian

(18)

again, for large r the hamiltonian (17) reduces to that of a particle moving in two

dimensions, this time in a potential v () = hd()2 + sin6 i. this potential has the
same features as the one discussed in section 3.1 and depicted in fig. 1: two minima
at  = 0 and  = , and a maximum at  = c such that cos c = 1  2.

3.2 extremal case: the bps baryon

we begin the analysis of the solutions by specializing to the extremal (rh = 0) back-
ground, with the aim of obtaining the supersymmetric fourbrane embeddings analogous
to the vebrane bps congurations found in [6]. following that paper, we set x = 0
in (15), to describe a baryon of zero-size. the euler-lagrange equation for r() is then

d

d  

r

r2 + r2qd2 + sin6 ! =

r

r2 + r2qd2 + sin6  .

(19)

the system under consideration here is in such close correspondence to the one studied
in [6], that it is easy to guess the bps condition analogous to the one for a vebrane
embedded in ads5  s5 [7, 6, 22]:

r
r

=

sin4  + d() cos 

sin3  cos   d() sin 

,

(20)

where d() is the function specied in (16). it is easy to verify that (20) is a rst
integral of (19). it is thus almost certainly the condition for the fourbrane embedding
to be supersymmetric, although we have not checked this explicitly.

just like its vebrane cousin [6], equation (20) can be solved analytically to obtain

a one-parameter family of bps congurations,

r() =

a

sin  " ()

2(1  )#1/2

,

() = 1  2  cos ,

(21)

where the scale factor a is arbitrary, and  is the integration constant in (16). the
solutions (21) have the exact same features as their vebrane counterparts (see eq.
(9) and fig. 1 in [6]): they describe tubes of radius a (r  a/(  ) when   ),
with an asymptotic tension and total energy equal to those of (1  )n strings. the

14

 = 0 embedding has the shape of a test tube with r(0) = r0 = a/2. this solution
captures all n units of fourform ux; it corresponds to a baryon in the d = 4 + 1 sym
theory. notice that the surfaces (21) are dened in the range where ()  0, namely
c    , where the critical angle c is dened by
cos c = 1  2.

(22)

for  > 0, the solutions intersect r = 0 at  = c > 0, and capture only a fraction of
the total ux. they represent gauge theory objects with fewer than n quarks (see the
discussion in [6]).

3.3 nonextremal case: the point baryon

having understood the character of the bps congurations in the extremal background,
we now proceed to examine the solutions for nite horizon radius. the fourbrane
embeddings corresponding to baryons of the four-dimensional gauge theory with all
of their component quarks at the same gauge theory position (x = 0) and s5 angle
( = ), have px = 0 (i.e. x = 0) and  = 0 (see section 3.4 for the case x
6= 0,
 > 0). as in section 2.2, to obtain a smooth solution we enforce the boundary
conditions r = 0 and r = r0 at  = 0.

numerical integration with these boundary conditions yields results completely anal-
ogous to those found for the three-dimensional case in section 2.2. there exists a
one-parameter family of solutions with parameter  = r0/rh  1 (see fig. 2). when
 < crit  18 the solution tilts towards and eventually crosses the symmetry axis, thus
reaching  =  at a nite value of r. as   1 (i.e. r0  rh), the brane becomes more
and more spherical (notice that r() = rh is a solution to the equations of motion). for
 > crit, on the other hand, the solution tilts away from the symmetry axis, reaching
 =  only at r = .

the cusp in the  < crit solutions is again to be understood as the point of insertion
of n fundamental strings (or equivalently, a collapsed fourbrane), running along the
ray  = . a variational calculation like the one performed in section 2.2 shows that
the stable conguration is the one with   . so again the embeddings (similar
to those portrayed in fig. 2) describe the process through which the n fundamental
strings deform the initially spherical fourbrane, pulling it out to innity. the nal
conguration has the shape of a tube, just like the bps embeddings found in the
previous subsection. in the supersymmetric case r0 is a modulus of the conguration;
but in the rh > 0 case a potential drives the stable solution away to innity.

15

3.4 the split baryon: color dependence of the string ten-

sion

in this section we study solutions with px 6= 0 (i.e. x 6= 0) and  > 0, which correspond
to a baryon split into two separate groups of n and (1  )n quarks, a distance l
apart, and connected by a color ux tube. the story here is in perfect parallel to
the three-dimensional case discussed in section 2.3, although the quantitative results
are slightly dierent. the two groups of quarks are represented by born-infeld strings
bundles protruding from opposite poles of the s4,   0 and   . the ux tube
connecting the two bundles of quarks is dual to a segment of the fourbrane that runs
close and parallel to the horizon, at the critical angle  = c given by equation (22).
this is the maximum of the potential introduced at the end of section 3.1. the critical
angle as a function of  has the property that c(0) = 0, and c() =   c(1  ).

numerical integration with initial conditions analogous to (11) yields fourbrane em-
beddings of the same type as those found in the three-dimensional case (see figs. 3 and
4). for large quark separation l the energy of the conguration is again proportional
to l, indicating connement. due to the fact that the relation between  and c is
now simpler than that in section 2.3, the tension of the ux tube can now be given
very explicitly as a function of . it is

4() =

1
272 n(g2

y m4n)t 2(1  ) .

(23)

the dierent powers of t , n, and the t hooft coupling 4 = g2
found in [5, 19], where the baryon is studied within a somewhat dierent scheme.

y m4n match those

the simple dependence of the ux tube tension on  is perhaps what one would have
naively guessed: the product of the charges. it is amusing to see that this diers only
slightly from the three-dimensional result. for ease of comparison the -dependence of
the tension (normalized to unity at the maximum) is plotted for both cases in fig. 6.
all the qualitative features of the tension as a function of  are the same as in the
three-dimensional gauge theory. in particular, for  = 1/n  1 (i.e., when a single
quark is pulled out), 4 is independent of n (for given t hooft coupling) and exactly
matches the quark-antiquark string tension obtained in [11].9

finally, we want to emphasize that again the excitation energies associated with the
ux tube tension (23) in the supergravity regime are larger than the compactication
scale, so the gauge theory is not strictly four-dimensional [5, 11].

9notice that equation (3.20) in [11] is incorrect by a factor of 8.

4 conclusions

we have seen how studying the detailed shape of a d5/4-brane, embedded in the
near-horizon geometry of a large number n of non-extremal d3/4-branes, can reveal
much information about the structure and energetics of baryons in the corresponding
strongly-coupled su(n) gauge theory. in particular, we were able to construct em-
beddings representing a baryon split into two separate clumps of quarks, with a color
ux tube running between them. as expected for a conning theory, the energy of
such a conguration is proportional to the separation between the two quark bundles.
reading o the tension of the ux tube, we discovered a non-trivial and physically
reasonable dependence on the color charges of the individual clumps.

we also studied the simpler point-baryon embeddings, where all the quarks sit
on top of each other. the use of the full born-infeld plus wess-zumino action for
the system makes it clear that the naive picture of the baryon as n fundamental
strings terminating on a spherical ve/four-brane is incomplete: the strings pull on the
brane and deform it. our solutions displayed several interesting features, such as the
appearance of a potential for the overall scale of the system (which was a modulus in
the extremal case), that ultimately causes the brane to expand out to innity. many
of the features in these solutions call out for a deeper explanation. in particular, they
point to the need for a fuller understanding of the relation between the angular (s5/s4)
dependence of the d5/4-brane embedding and the avor structure and energetics of
the dual baryonic state.

an obvious extension of our work would be to study the baryon in thermal gauge
theories. for the example of nite temperature (3+1)-dimensional sym, one considers

17

again a vebrane embedded in the nonextremal d3-brane geometry (1), but this time
extending along the compact  direction. a study of this system leads to some puzzling
features, which we hope to clarify and report on in the near future.

recently, type 0 string theory has been suggested as a means to construct grav-
ity duals for large n non-supersymmetric four-dimensional gauge theories with phe-
nomenologically interesting behavior [13, 14]. in particular, it has been argued that, at
least at the classical level, the type 0 equations of motion have asymptotic solutions
which express asymptotic freedom in the uv and connement in the ir [14]. it would
be very interesting to study the baryon in this setting. at present, the full background
geometry is not known, so the analysis would have to be restricted to vebrane em-
beddings which lie only in the asymptotic uv region. we hope that a complete study
will eventually become possible.

in our analysis the born-infeld string approach has again proven very fruitful. we
expect that many more lessons will be extracted with this valuable tool in the future.
