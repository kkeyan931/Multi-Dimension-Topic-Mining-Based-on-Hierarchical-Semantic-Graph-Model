abstract

we discuss three-dimensional 4 + 6 theory in the context of the 1/n expansion at nite

temperature. we use the method of the composite operator (cjt) for summing a large sets of

feynman graphs. we analyse the behavior of the thermal square mass and the thermal coupling

constant in the low and high temperature limit. the existent of the tricritical point at some

temperature is found using this non-pertubative method.

1 introduction

the conventional perturbation theory in the coupling or loop expansion can only be used for the

study of small quantum corrections to classical results. when discussing truly quantum mechanical

eects to any given order in such an expansion, one is not usually able to justify the neglect of

yet higher order. in other way, for theories with a large n dimensional internal symmetry group

there exist another perturbation scheme, the 1/n expansion, which circumvents this criticism.

each term in the 1/n expansion contains an innite subset of terms of the loop expansion. the

1/n expansion has the nice property that the leading-order quantum corrections are the same

order as the classical quantities. consequently, the leading order which adequately characterizes

the theory in the large n limit preserves much of the nonlinear structure of the full theory. in

the next section we derive the eective action to leading order in 1/n for three dimensions and

consequently the eective potential. in this paper we compute eective thermal mass which depend

on the temperature for the eld theory with 6 interaction on d = 3 euclidean dimensions. its

is known that, in d > 4, such theories with 4 interaction are in fact free eld theory, while in

d < 4 they have a non-trivial continuum limit as an interacting eld theory.

since both the six-point coupling of (6)d=3 and the four-point coupling of (4)d=4 are

dimensionless one expected that have the same continuum limit. however it has been shown that,

in the large n limit, the (6) theory has a uv xed point for d = 3 and therefore must have a

second infra-red xed point [1]. at least for large n the 6 theory is known to be qualitatively

dierent from (4)d=4 theory. we study the large n expansion, using the methods of composite

1

operator [2]. the organization of the letter is the following. in section ii we briey discuss the

composite operator (cjt) formalism. in section iii the thermal gap equation is derived. in section

iv the tricritical phenomenon is presented. conclusions are given in section v. in this paper we

use c = kb = h = 1.

2 the eective potential( the cjt formalism)

we are interested here in the most general renormalizable scalar eld theories 4 +6 possessing

an internal symmetry o(n), in three dimensions. for simplicity we will call a 6 model. we use

the method of composite operator developed by cornwall, jackiw and tomboulis [2, 3] for summing

large sets of feynman graphs by considering only two-particle irreducible (2pi) graphs express in

terms of the exact propagators. this technique lead to the formulation of the eective action

and eective potential which is functional the vacuum expectation value of both the quantum

eld (x) and the time ordered product t {(x)(y)} of the elds. using this method townsend

derived the eective potential of 6 theory to leading order in the 1

n expansion for d  3 [5] and

proof that 1

n expansion is consistent for 6 to leading order in 1

n . the lagrangian density of the

o(n) symmetry 6 theory is :

(1)

where the quantum eld is an n-component vector in the n-dimensional internal symmetry space.

for deniteness, we work at zero-temperature; however, the nite temperature generalizations can

2

be easily obtained [4]. we are interested in the eective action () which governs the behavior

of the expectation values a(x) of the quantum eld where  is given by

(x) 

w (j)
j(x)

=< 0||0 >,

(2)

where w (j) is the generating functional for connected greens functions.

() can be show to be the sum of one-particle irreducible (1pi) feynman graphs with a factor

a(x) on the external line. we may use of the formalism of composite operator who reduce the

problem to summing two particle irreducible (2pi) feynman graphs by dening a generalized

eective action (, g) which is a functional not only a(x), but also of the expectation values

gab(x, y) of the time ordered product of quantum elds t {(x)(y)}.

and is shorthand for dab(; x, y), 2(, g) is computed as follows. in the classical action i()

shift the eld  by . the new action i( + ) posses term cubic and higher in ; this dene an

interaction part iint(, ) where the vertices depend on . 2(, g) is given by sum of all (2pi)

vacuum graphs in a theory with vertices determined by iint(, ) and the propagators set equal

to g(x, y). the trace and logarithm in eq.(3) are functional.

the eective action as usually dened is found by solving for gab(x, y) in the equation

(, g)
gab(x, y)

(5)

(6)

and substituting in the generalized eective action (, g).

the vertices in the above equation contains factor 1/n or 1/n 2, but a  loop gives a factor

of n provided the o(n) isospin ows around it alone and not into another part of the graph. we

usually call such loops bubbles. then the leading order in 1/n the vacuum graphs are bubbles

trees with two or three bubbles at each vertex. the (2pi) graphs are shown in gure.(1). it is

(11)

where gab is given implicitly by eq.(9). the last two term on the r.h.s of eq.(11) is the leading

two-loop contribution to the eective action for composite operators in 4 + 6 theory. as usual

we may simplify by separating gab into transverse and longitudinal components, so

gab = (ab

now we can take the trace respect the indices,

(14)

from this equation to leading order in 1

n , gab is diagonal in a, b. substituting eq.(14) into eq.(11)

and eq.(9) and keep only the leading order one nds the daisy and superdaisy resumed eective

potential for the 4 + 6 theory is given by:

3 the gap-equation for the model (4 + 6)d=3 at finite

temperature

let us suppose that our system is in equilibrium with a thermal bath. at the one-loop approxi-

mation the thermal mass and coupling constant for the 4 model in a d-dimensional euclidean

space have been obtained in a previous work [6] and for the the theory (4)d is obtained using

the composite operator method [7]. it is clear that for d = 3 the (4)d model is not the most

general perturbative renormalizable model and we are able to introduce a 6 term preserving the

renormalizability of theory. for d = 3 the 4 + 6 model is the most general o(n) symmet-

ric model which preserves the perturbative renormalizability. most general models with cubic

symmetry can be also studied. in the conclusion we will briey discuss this model.

to study the temperature eects in quantum eld theory the most used methods is the imag-

inary time green function approach [4], which amounts to replace the continuous four momenta

k4 by discrete n an integration by a summation ( = 1

t ):

in order to regularized this expression we use a mixing between dimensional regularization and

analytic regularization. for this purpose we dene the expression i(d, s) as :

using analytic extension of the inhomogeneous epstein zeta function it is possible to obtain the

where k(z) is the modied bessel function of third kind. fortunately for d = 3 the analytic

extension of the function i(d, s, m) is nite and can be express in a closed form [8] (note in

d = 3 we have no pole, at least in this approximation), and particular

f() = i(3, 1, m()) =

if we have no spontaneous symmetric breaking, we dene the thermal eective mass as

(27)

(28)

(29)

where the m2, and  are the nite parameter of the theory at tree-level. so eq.(28) and eq.(29)

determined the behavior of the eective mass with the temperature and from this relations it is

possible to show that the mass increase with the temperature.

and the expression for the eective coupling constant can be derived from the relation given

by:

where m 2

 () is given by eq.(18), so after some algebra we nd that,

this is the thermal eective coupling constant at leading order. in order to found the behavior of

the thermal eective coupling constant with the temperature, we used the solution for the eq.(28)

and replace in eq.(31). from this we conclude that the eective thermal coupling constant increase

with the temperature. in the next section we discuss the existence of the tricritical phenomenon

in this model at nite temperature.

4 the tricritical phenomenon

in the last section we obtained the thermal correction to the square mass m2

 an the coupling

constant  in absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking. the tricritical phenomenon occurs

when  = m2

 = 0. if it happens we conclude that spontaneous symmetry breaking must be

occur. at tree level this happen when the classical potential v0(), develops an absolute minimum

for 2 6= 0. if we consider quantum eects, then from eq.(20) we have the relation(we discus at

t = 0)

becomes

(35)

this is the same equations as for the tree approximation, but in terms of the renormalized param-

eters. and the eective square mass vanishes at the minimum i.e m 2() = 0, this is consequence

10

of the goldstones theorem. from eq.(35) provides tree possibilities for symmetry breaking :

(36)

1.   0 , m2 < 0

2.  < 0 , m2 < 0

3.  < 0 , m2  0.

(37)

suciently large we have two real positive zeros for v0(). in this case for m2 > 0 at 52

8 = m2 we

have a rst order transition as shown in gure.(2). then the point m2 = 0,  = 0 is the tricritical

point, which the rst and second order transitions meet here. of course the relation in eq.(37)

11

was found by requiring that the minimum of the classical potential in region 3 be absolute. if we

consider quantum corrections this relation must be modied. at nite temperature the eective

parameter m2 and  change with the temperature as we discussed in the preceding section. at

suciently high temperature we guess form eq.(31) that there is no symmetry breaking. then in

order to use the relations of the last section we rst started when the symmetry is present and

from this we prove that it can be exist an intermediate temperature c at which m2

c = 0, c = 0

.

first we note that the eq.(26) is valid only for m2

 > 0 and this expression is not useful to nd

the critical temperature. so we regularized this expression in the limit m2

 = 0, (m2

 > 0) and for

d = 3   we get,

lim i(3  , s = 1, m) = ( 1

ir(c) =

);

(39)

where c  m is the mass parameter and k is a numeric constant. the infrared-induced un-

certainties can be subsumed into single parameter c [9]. so the tricritical phenomenon occurs

when

ir(c).

(40)

and from this relations we conclude that if the tricritical phenomena occurs we must be keep the

next two following relation:

2 = 6m2

5

c = 2
c 
k exp ( 
t 2
5tc

).

(41)

where tc is the critical temperature at which the tricritical phenomenon occurs. of course the

parameters (m2, ) must be in the region 3 in order to occur the tricritical phenomena an obey

the relation eq.(41).

5 conclusions

we have done in this paper an analysis of the vector model 4 + 6 in d = 3 euclidean

dimensions at nite temperature. the form of the thermal corrections to the mass and coupling

constant have been found using resummation methods in the leading order 1

n approximation

(hartree-fock approximation). we conclude that these parameters increase with the temperature.

this ressult is consistent with previous work [7] in the sense that we are able to recover in the

limit  = 0.

we discussed the existent of the tricritical phenomenon at nite temperature and we have

been found an expression for the critical temperature at which the thermal eective mass and cou-

pling constant vanishes, and this shown that the tricritical phenomena occurs at an intermediate

temperature tc.

a natural extension of this work is to study the cubic anisotropic model with the following

in d = 4 with the 4 model appear dierent xed points (a gaussian, heisenberg, ising and

cubic) [10] and between them the heisenberg xed point is the only stable when m < 4. for

m > 4 the cubic xed point becomes stable. this model is under investigation by the authors.
