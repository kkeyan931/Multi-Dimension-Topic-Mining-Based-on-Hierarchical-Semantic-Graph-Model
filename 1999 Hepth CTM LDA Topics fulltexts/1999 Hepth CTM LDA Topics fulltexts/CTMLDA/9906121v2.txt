abstract

we determine all the terms that are gauge-invariant up to a total
spacetime derivative (semi-invariant terms) for gauged non-linear
sigma models. assuming that the isotropy subgroup h of the gauge
group is compact or semi-simple, we show that (non-trivial) such terms
exist only in odd dimensions and are equivalent to the familiar chern-
simons terms for the subgroup h. various applications are mentioned,
including one to the gauging of the wess-zumino-witten terms in even
spacetime dimensions. our approach is based on the analysis of the
descent equation associated with semi-invariant terms.

1 introduction

the lagrangian of a dynamical system invariant under a given symmetry
is invariant itself up to a total spacetime derivative, l = k. in some
cases, one can redene the lagrangian without modifying its euler-lagrange
derivatives, l  l = l + l, so that the new lagrangian is strictly in-
variant, l = 0. in other cases, however, this is impossible. a well-known
example is the chern-simons term for yang-mills theory in odd spacetime
dimensions [1], which is invariant only up to an unremovable total derivative.
terms for which m = k but m 6= m  m with m = 0 are some-
times called (non trivial) semi-invariant terms and we shall adopt here this
convenient terminology.

given a theory, it is important to know all the terms that can be added
to the action without destroying the assumed symmetries. while the iden-
tication of the manifestly invariant terms is usually rather straightforward,
it is in general more dicult to determine systematically the semi-invariant
ones. the purpose of this letter is to solve this question for gauged non-
linear sigma models. as it is well known, these models occur repeatedly in
supergravity [2, 3, 4].

our work is motivated by the beautiful paper [5], where a method for
constructing a new class of semi-invariant terms in even spacetime dimen-
sions, with topological connotation, is described. as pointed out there, a
necessary condition for these terms to exist is that the gauge group be non
semi-simple. the question was further studied in [6], where it was proved that
if the isotropy subgroup h of the gauge group reduces to the identity, then,
no matter what the gauge group is, the terms of [5] dier from strictly gauge-
invariant terms by a total derivative and thus are not truly semi-invariant.
we show here that this conclusion remains valid whenever h is compact or
semi-simple. in fact, the only available non-trivial semi-invariant terms are
then the chern-simons terms based on the subgroup h, but these exist only
in odd dimensions. more precisely, any semi-invariant term is proportional
to a chern-simons term up to terms that are strictly gauge-invariant and
up to a total derivative. thus, under the assumption that h is compact or
semi-simple, non-trivial semi-invariant terms are exhausted by the familiar
chern-simons family.

our approach is based on the analysis of the brst descent equation

associated with semi-invariant terms.

2 description of -models

we denote the gauge group by g, its lie algebra by g and the yang-mills
connection by aa
 . the lie group g may be non-compact since non-compact
groups are typically the rule in supergravity. in addition to the sigma-model
variables, we allow for the presence of matter elds yi transforming in some
linear representation of g.

the gauge group g may not act transitively on the manifold m of the non-
linear sigma model. for instance, m could be a homogeneous space g/h 
invariant under a bigger group g of which g is only a proper subgroup. in
that case, we assume the existence of a slice through every point of m, so that
m splits into g-orbits, which are smooth submanifolds [7]. the g-orbits are -
by denition - homogeneous spaces for g and thus of the form g/h where the
isotropy subgroup h depends in general on the orbits. in a stratum where the
isometry subgroup is constant, one may locally introduce coordinates that
parametrize the points in the coset manifold g/h and coordinates  that
are constant along the orbits2. these latter transform in the trivial linear
representation of g and can simply be included among the matter elds
yis. they are gauge-invariant while the coordinates along the orbits could
be gauged away by xing the gauge (as we shall see, the s contribute to
the brst cohomology but not the coordinates along the orbits).

thus, provided one allows for extra matter elds and includes the co-
ordinates  among them, one can assume that g (the gauge group) acts
transitively on the (smooth) manifold of the non-linear model, which has the
form g/h. this will be done from now on. the subgroup h is assumed to
be compact or semi-simple.

first, we recall a few properties of coset spaces. for that matter, it is
convenient to split the generators ta of g into two sets, the generators of the
lie algebra of h (h) and the remaining ones,

ta = {t, ta},

(2.1)

where capital latin indices refer to g, small greek indices to h and small latin
indices to the chosen supplementary subspace k. the commutators

[ta, tb] = f c

abtc,

[t, t] = f 

t

(2.2)

2 how to patch strata together may presumably be achieved along the lines of [3]
combined with the results concerning linear representations, but we have not investigated
this question here.

dene the structure constants of g and h respectively. because h is semi-
simple or compact, the coset space is reductive. this means that one can
choose the supplementary generators ta so that the commutators [ta, t]
involve only the tbs,

[ta, t] = f c

atc.

(2.3)

thus, the structure constants f 
resentation of h.

a vanish and the generators ta dene a rep-

coset representatives may be taken to be of the form

u() = exp{ata},

(2.4)

with some real elds a, the number of which equals the dimension of g/h.
the a provide local coordinates in the vicinity of a = 0. we shall in a
rst approach restrict the sigma-model elds to be in a star-shaped neigh-
bourhood of a = 0. how to deal with global features (which are easily
incorporated) is discussed in the conclusions.

the group g acts on the left as

gu() = u( )h(, g)

(2.5)

with g  g and h  h (note that right action conventions were adopted in
[6]). the innitesimal transformation property of the local parameters a is
derived through the parametrization

g = exp{ata}, h(, g) = exp{u(, )t}

(2.6)

3 brst dierential

if l is invariant under gauge transformations up to a total derivative,

l = k

(3.1)

then k itself is not arbitrary but subject to some denite conditions obtained
by evaluating the commutators of the second variations of l.

it is convenient to analyse this question in terms of the brst dierential

(3.3)
(3.4)

(3.5)

where the matrices ya are the generators of the representation of the ys,
[ya, yb] = f a
bcyc, and where c a are the ghosts. the brst dierential acts
also on the so-called antields. since we are interested only in terms that are
o-shell gauge invariant (up to a total divergence), we shall, however, not
include them. comments on more general deformations are briey given at
the end.

local forms are exterior forms on spacetime which depend on the elds,
the ghosts and their derivatives. a density l that is gauge-invariant up to
a total divergence denes, in dual terms, a local n-form with ghost number
zero that is -closed modulo d,

a + db = 0.

a redenition of l by a total divergence is clearly equivalent to

a  a + c + de

(3.6)

(3.7)

since there is no form in negative ghost number in the absence of antields
(c  0). the question under study is thus equivalent to determining whether
elements in the cohomology h 0(|d) have a representative that is strictly
-exact.

the advantage of reformulating the question in these cohomological terms
is that there are well-developed techniques for handling the brst cohomol-
ogy h 0(|d). the idea is that the equation (3.6) implies b + de = 0 for
some (n  2)-form e of ghost number two. by continuing in the same way,
one gets a chain of equations a + db = 0, b + de = 0, e + df = 0 (the
descent), the last two of which read m+ dn = 0 and n = 0. if n is trivial
in h(), n = u, then one can absorb it in redenitions (m  m = m  du

5

and n  n  u = 0) and shorten the descent by one step, the last equation
being now m = 0.

in a rst stage, one thus determines all non trivial solutions of n = 0,
without restriction on the ghost number. in a second stage, one determines
which among these solutions can be lifted all the way back up to form-degree
n. both problems have been studied in the literature.

4 the -cohomology

our strategy for computing the -cohomology is to perform an appropriate
change of variables in the jet-space coordinatized by the elds, the ghosts
and their derivatives. this change of variables is adapted to the symmetry
and combines the analysis of [8] for coset models with ungauged symmetry
with the change of variables of [6] for the gauged principal models (h reduced
to the identity).

the starting point is the observation that if one decomposes the lie

algebra-valued form u()1(d + a)u() in the basis (ta, t),

u()1(d + a)u() = pa(, a)ta + v(, a)t,

(4.1)

one generates a quantity pa
eld v

 that behaves as an h-gauge connection,

 that is covariant under the action of h, and a

pa
v

bpb
 = f a
d + d
v
 = f 

d

(4.2)

(4.3)

the ghosts d are identical to the u(, ) that occured in the parametriza-
tion of h(, g), with the gauge parameters a being replaced by the ghosts
c a,

b()c b.
the nilpotence of  requires the d to transform as

d() = u(, c) = 

d = 

1
2

f 
dd

(4.4)

(4.5)

we complete the redenition of the ghosts by introducing the abelian ghosts
da, which are the brst variations of the coset space coordinates a,

da = a = a

b()c b, da = 0

(4.6)

6

this redenition of the ghosts is clearly invertible in the vicinity of the iden-
tity, since the matrix a
b() is invertible. thus, one can trade the c a for the
da,

da = a

b()c b, c a = a

b()db.

(4.7)

the h-connection v can be used to construct a v-covariant derivative of p,

d(v)

 p = p + [v, p], d(v)

 p = [d(v)

 p, d]

(4.8)

the sux v has been introduced to distinguish d(v)


from d(a)
 .

 in terms of the variables a, a, pa

a of (2.9), which is invertible. the relation aa

the crucial observation now is that one can use (4.1) to express the
 (in
 in (4.1) is the
, v
 )
 , which thus may be ex-
 as
. furthermore, the relation between
bdb, may also be

yang-mills connection aa
the vicinity of the identity). indeed, the matrix multiplying aa
matrix kb
may clearly be prolonged to the derivatives of aa
pressed in an invertible way through the ordinary derivatives of a and v
well as the v-covariant derivatives of pa
the original ghosts c a and the redened ones, c a = a
prolonged to the subsequent derivatives.

 (a, a, pa

 and v

 = aa

in the same way, all the linearly transforming elds yi may be combined
with the coset representative u() written in the adequate representation,
to form h-covariant elds together with their v-covariant derivatives.
if
for instance yi transforms in the representation d of g generated by (ya)i
j,
y  = d(g)y, then the quantity y = d(u 1())y transforms only under h,
y  = d(h)y, with h given by (2.5). in terms of the brst dierential,  yi =
j yjd. the v-covariant derivative d(v) y shares the same transformation
y i
property.

thus, one may take as redened set of jet-space coordinates the local
coset coordinates a and the new ghosts da, together with their ordinary
derivatives; the h-gauge connection v
 with its ordinary derivatives; and the
h-covariant quantities pa

 and yi with their v-covariant derivatives.

the variables a and da form brst contractible pairs since a = da
and da = 0. the same is true for their derivatives. thus the brst
cohomology involves only the h-connection v
 and the the ghosts d, as
well as the h-covariant objects pa
 and yi, together with their v-covariant
derivatives. the problem of computing h() for the yang-mills + gauged
non-linear sigma model g/h with gauge group g is thus reduced to the
problem of computing h() for a yang-mills model with gauge group h

7

and elds transforming in some denite linear representation of h. this is
a well-known problem whose solution may be found in [9, 10, 11]. let [ ]c
denote the h-covariant elds pa
and their successive v-covariant
derivatives. then, any -cocycle takes the form

, yi and f (v)



a = 0  a = p i

inv([ ]c)lie

inv is an invariant polynomial and lie

where p i
(d) stands for a basis of the
lie algebra cohomology of h. since h is compact or semi-simple, this coho-
mology is generated by the primitive elements which are the ghosts of the
abelian factors as well as trd3 and traces of appropriate higher powers of d
for the non-abelian factors (see [12] for more information).

variables pa

for the yang-mills theory with gauge group g.

5 -cocycles modulo d

the previous analysis provides the -cohomology for all values of the ghost
numbers. in particular, at ghost number zero (no lie
(d) in (4.9)), one sees
that the most general gauge-invariant polynomial is an invariant polynomial
in the h-covariant elds pa
, yi and their covariant derivatives. there
are no other strictly invariant terms.

, f (v)



i

to determine the terms that are gauge-invariant only up to a total di-
vergence, one must, through the descent equation, determine the possible
bottoms (solutions of a = 0) that can be lifted. again, this problem has
been systematically studied [9, 10, 11] with the result that the most general
solution of the equation a + db = 0 is given, at ghost number zero, by

a = c + cs + dm

(5.1)

where c is stricly invariant (c = 0) and thus of the above form while
cs stands for a linear combination with constant coecients of the chern-
simons terms for the eective gauge group h, which are available only in
odd dimensions. the chern-simons terms do not involve the matter elds

8

yi or pa
 and their derivatives, but only the vector potential v and its eld
strength. in particular, one way rewrite the chern-simons terms for g as
chern-simons terms for h modulo strictly gauge-invariant terms and total
derivatives.

similarly, the terms constructed in [5], which are dened in even dimen-
sions, dier from strictly gauge-invariant terms by total divergences. this
was explicitly veried in [6] in the principal case with abelian gauge group.
a non-abelian example follows from the analysis of [13]. the gauge group
is three-dimensional and its lie algebra reads

[t0, t1] = 2t1,

[t0, t2] = t2,

[t1, t2] = 0.

(5.2)

the subgroup generated by t0 is non-compact.

the construction of [5] relies on a non-trivial cocycle ca,bc of the lie-
algebra cohomology with value in the symmetric tensor product of the adjoint
representation, which we take to be as in [13]

c1,22 = 2, c2,12 = c2,21 = 1,

(5.3)

others vanish. besides the yang-mills eld, we consider the eld a taking
value in the group g (principal case). the corresponding semi-invariant
terms take the form

sab(a)f a  f b +

2
3

ca,bcaa  ab  (dac 

3
8

f c
dead  ae)

(5.4)

one easily veries that (5.4) is gauge-invariant up to a non-vanishing surface
term provided sab = sba transforms as

sab = (2sc(af c

b)d + cd,ab)d

one may take for sab()

s00 = 2(2)21, s01 =

1
2

(2)2, s02 = 212,

s11 = 0, s12 = 2, s22 = 21

(5.5)

(5.6)

(5.7)

up to terms that transform homogeneously and clearly lead to strictly gauge-
invariant contributions to the action. in this case (5.4) reads explicitly

2(2)21f 0  f 0 + (2)2f 0  f 1  412f 0  f 2
22f 1  f 2 + 21f 2  f 2 + 2a1  a2  da2

(5.8)

9

by a direct calculation, one easily checks that (5.8) diers from the strictly

gauge-invariant term

2p1  p2  dp2

(5.9)

by a total derivative. here, the pas are the invariant one-forms

p0 = i 0, p1 = (exp 20)[i 1 + 21i 0], p2 = (exp 0)[i 2  2i 0]

(5.10)

with

i 0 = d0  a0,
i 1 = d1  21d0  a1,
i 2 = d2 + 2d0  a2.

(5.11)

even though ca,bc denes a non-trivial lie-algebra cohomological class (for
g), there is no obstruction in rewriting (5.8) in a manifestly gauge-invariant
way by adding a total derivative. the algebraic obstructions for doing so
are given by the lie-algebra cohomology of h, and are absent here.
[in
addition, as mentioned in the conclusions, the de rham cohomology of g
controls whether the construction done in a star-shaped neighbourhood of the
identity in eld space can be extended to the whole of of the eld manifold.
there is no problem here since the de rham cohomology of g is trivial; and
indeed, (5.9) is globally dened.]

6 gauged wess-zumino-witten terms

the problem investigated in this letter is the problem of nding the most
general term that can be added to the lagrangian while preserving g-gauge-
invariance (up to a total derivative). this problem has an indirect bearing on
the problem of gauging the wess-zumino-witten term, which we rst briey
review.

the wess-zumino-term [14, 15] for the ungauged non-linear sigma model

in n spacetime dimensions reads

w = zx

h

(6.1)

where x is a (n + 1)-dimensional manifold with spacetime as boundary and
where h is a closed (n + 1)-form on the manifold m of the scalar elds that

10

is invariant under g,

lah = 0, dh = 0.

(6.2)

in (6.1), h is the pull-back of h to x. one may write h = db locally in
eld space. thus, one can transform (6.1) as a n-dimensional integral over
spacetime

w = z dnxba1...an((x))1a12a2    nan1...n

(6.3)

for congurations of the elds in a star-shaped neighbourhood of  = 0.

because h is invariant under g, the n-form b is invariant under g up to

a total derivative

lab = dka

(6.4)

this guarantees that the wess-zumino-witten term is (semi-)invariant under
the rigid g-transformations generated by the killing vectors a
a. again, it
may not be possible to add a total derivative to the integrand of (6.3) to
make it strictly g-invariant. there may be algebraic restrictions for doing
this, independently of whether b can be globally dened in the whole of m.
for instance, a non-zero translation-invariant (= constant) (n + 1)-form in
rk is closed and cannot be written as the exterior derivative of a translation-
invariant n-form since the exterior derivative of a constant n-form vanishes.
the obstruction exists even though the de rham cohomology of rk is trivial;
it can be detected by a local analysis.

one says that the wzw term (6.1) can be gauged if one can add to it
terms involving the g-connection aa
 so as to make it invariant under local
g-transformations up to a total derivative. we claim that in even spacetime
dimensions, the wzw term can be gauged if and only if one can make the
integrand of (6.3) strictly invariant under g-transformations by adding to it
a total derivative. in that case, the gauging is of course direct. if one cannot
(locally) replace b in (6.3) by a term that is strictly invariant under rigid
g-transformations, the gauging is impossible.

this is an immediate consequence of our analysis. indeed, if the wzw
term can be gauged, then the gauged wzw term must be in the list given
above of the terms that can be added to the lagrangian without destroying
the gauge symmetry. thus, the gauged wzw term (if it can be gauged)
must be one of the possible semi-invariant terms for (2.15).

11

in even dimensions, there is no chern-simons term and all semi-invariant
terms dier from strictly invariant ones by total derivatives. thus, in par-
ticular, the gauged wzw term (if it exists) takes the form w zwgauged =
r (invariant + dk). setting the connection aa
 equal to zero in this relation-
ship yields the desired result. note that the argument does not work in odd
spacetime dimensions. there are gaugeable wzw terms that are not de-
scribed by invariant forms b. upon gauging, these lead to the chern-simons
terms for h, an information that one can use to explicitly construct them.

because the conditions for gauging [16, 17] are not usually formulated in
those terms, we nd it instructive to verify explicitly the (local) equivalence
of the gauged wzw term to a strictly g-invariant term in the simplest
case, namely, two dimensions. as stated above, the obstructions to that
equivalence can be detected by a local analysis, so we work in a stratum of
the manifold m of the scalar elds where the isotropy group is constant. we
consider in fact a region of the form b  g/h where b is a star-shaped
open set with g-invariant coordinates . we keep explicitly the b-factor
to check that it is indeed irrelevant for the present purposes.

let n be the counting operator for the ds,

n = d



(d)

.

the 3-form h splits into a sum

h = h(0) + h(1) + h(2) + h(3)

(6.5)

(6.6)

where nh(k) = kh(k), i.e., h(k) contains k d and (3  k) da. since the
killing vectors a
a depend only on the s, one has [n, la] = 0. further-
more, d = d0 + d1, [n, d0] = 0, [n, d1] = d1 with d0 = (/a)da and
d1 = (/)d.

because dh = 0 and lah = 0, one has d1h(3) = 0 and lah(3) = 0. the
poincare lemma in b implies h(3) = d1u(2) where u(2) is a 2-form that may be
taken to be invariant, lau(2) = 0. indeed, the a are external parameters
for d1 so the standard homotopy for d1 (not d !), obtained by integrating
along rays in b, is easily veried to commute with la. if one substracts
du(2) from h, one gets a 3-form h without components containing three ds,
h = h + du(2), h = h(0) + h(1) + h(2).

12

by repeating the analysis for h(2) and then h(1), one easily concludes that

h takes the form

h = h + du

where both u and h are invariant

lau = 0, la

h = 0

and where h reduces to its 0-th component,

h = h(0).

(6.7)

(6.8)

(6.9)

one has also dh = 0, which implies both d1h = 0 and d0h = 0. the rst
condition means that h has no -dependence and is thus a 3-form dened
entirely on g/h. since h is gaugeable if and only if h is (recall that u in
(6.7) is g-invariant), we have completely eliminated the b-factor. we can
thus assume without loss of generality that m reduces to a single orbit g/h.
this will be done in the sequel; we shall also drop the tilde on h.

as shown in [16, 17], the 3-form h on g/h leads to a g-gaugeable wzw

term if and only if it fullls

iah = dva

for some 1-forms va on g/h that are required to obey

as well as

iavb + ib va = 0

lavb = f c

abvc.

now, the algebraic condition (6.11) implies that va takes the form

va = iab

(6.10)

(6.11)

(6.12)

(6.13)

for some 2-form b on g/h that is uniquely determined from va. indeed, given
va and a, the equations (6.13), which read explicitly b
a, form a
system of linear, inhomogeneous equations for bab. the system possesses at
most a solution because the killing vectors span the tangent space as g is
transitive, so b
acab = 0 implies cab = 0. the solution exists because the
consistency conditions of (6.13) are precisely (6.11).

abab = va

13

substituting (6.13) into (6.12) yields then

ib (lab) = 0.

(6.14)

again, since the killing vectors span the whole tangent space to g/h, this
implies

lab = 0.

(6.15)

the 2-form b is thus invariant. inserting (6.13) into (6.10) and using (6.15)
shows then that h is the exterior derivative of an invariant 2-form. a dier-
ent way to arrive at the same conclusion is to consider the descent associated
with (6.3) and to observe that there is no element in h() with ghost num-
ber two and form-degree zero, or ghost number one and form-degree one,
which could serve as non trivial bottom. thus, the descent is eectively
trivial and one may redene the integrand of (6.3) to make it strictly invari-
ant. [the strictly-invariant expression equivalent to the gauged wzw term
may however not be easy to work out explicitly in practice, or may not be
convenient].

7 comments and conclusions

our results are somewhat disappointing because they show that the familiar
h-chern-simons terms exhaust all semi-invariant terms when h is compact
or semi-simple. there are no others.
in particular, in even dimensions,
the construction of [5] provides semi-invariant terms that turn out to be
equivalent to strictly invariant ones. in retrospect, this is perhaps not too
surprising since one knows that g-invariance boils down to h-invariance in
the coset space case g/h with reductive embedding of h. to get new terms,
one needs thus to consider more general situations.

the above analysis assumed that the eld variables of the sigma-model
were restricted to a (star-shaped) neighbourhood of the identity. one may
easily take into account the non-trivial topology of eld space along the
lines of [18, 6]. the most convenient way to doing so is to work in the
lifted formulation, in which the sigma-model variables are g-elements and
the right action of h is gauged by means of a gauge eld without kinetic term.
one just nds, besides the chern-simons terms, additional semi-invariant
terms, namely the g-winding number terms. these well-known terms are

14

the pull-back to spacetime of representatives of the de rham cohomological
classes of g. like -terms, they can be written (locally in eld space but not
globally) as total divergences and do not contribute therefore to the equations
of motion. chern-simons like terms are not of this type since they do modify
the equations of motion and thus can be detected even in a local approach in
eld space. the details are given in [19], where the inclusion of the antields
is also treated and shown not to alter the main conclusions. one can, also in
the presence of antields, reduce the problem to the much studied standard
yang-mills problem with gauge group h.
