(2.5) checked gauge transformations (2.2) elds (2.5) transform covari- antly f(5) = 0, f(8) = (3) f(5). 2 (2.6) eld-strengths one construct analog chern class f(5) f(8). (2.7) easy see class (2.7) invariant respect gauge transformations (2.2), also following identity holds f(5) f(8) = d( 1 2 (a(4) da(7) + a(7) da(4)) + 1 6 a(4) a(4) a(4)) = dl. (2.8) thus everything reminiscent ordinary chern-simons theory, said far, exception gauge invariance, valid whether boundary not. presence boundary, things change rather interesting way. first all, seems theory longer gauge invariant, due total derivative which, upon integration, gives rise non-vanishing term boundary. however, know deal problem. solution comes conventional cs-theory, problem arises; one imposes boundary conditions order restore gauge invariance {$9410216$}. trivial condition gauge transformations vanish boundary interesting, since appears strong. choice impose following relations d(3) = d(6)|m12 , a(7) = a(4)|m12 , (2.9) hodge taken respect eleven-dimensional metric boundary. relations (2.9) hold boundary term vanishes, gauge invariance restored. also checked variational principle well dened case. normally, boundary lagrangian changes total derivative, problems may arise owing fact functional derivative well dened unless one adds extra terms boundary cancel terms coming bulk. situation boundary contribution bulk form z l = 1 2zm12 (a(4) a(7) a(7) a(4)), (2.10) vanishes boundary conditions (2.9) satised. end story though. action twelve-dimensional theory (2.1) written = zm12 = zm12 1 2 a(4) a(7) +zm12 2 a(4) a(4) +zm12 1 3 (a(7) da(4) + 1 6 a(4) a(4) a(4)) (2.11) (a(7) da(4) + 1 6 a(4) a(4) a(4)), second line used boundary conditions introduced (2.9). now, variation a(7)-eld (which simply plays role constraint) bulk gives condition da(4) = 0, implies (at least locally) a(4) = da(3), continuation must true boundary. thus one substitutes relation back lagrangian result theory boundary whose lagrangian identical one = 11 supergravity (without einstein-hilbert term). also subtleties gauge symmetry theory. generators simply constraints coming variation components a(4) a(7) gauge elds time index, since conjugate momenta. gm((6)) =zm11 (6) da(4), ge((3)) =zm11 (3) (da(7) + 1 2 a(4) a(4)), (2.12) (3) (6) arbitrary three-forms six-forms, integration spatial coordinates. states theory must satisfy constraints ge| = 0, gm| = 0. boundary, algebra constraints easily calculated using fact a(4) a(7) elds canonically conjugate other. algebra gives rise following brackets {ge(1 (3)), ge(2 (3))} = gm(1 (3) 2 (3)), {ge(1 (3)), gm(2 (6))} = 0. (2.13) however, spacetime boundary, one runs problem. functional derivatives constraints well dened, one needs add boundary terms generators cancel contributions, extra terms play role boundary symmetries. namely one needs add gm = rm11 ge = rm11 (modied) ge gm generators changes, becoming {ge((3)), gm((6))} = rm11 (3) a(7) = rm11 d(6). imposed constraints ge| = 0, gm| = 0 gauge symmetry (3) a(4) ge, also commutator (6) a(4) gm, (3) bulk therefore gives rise symmetry theory boundary {ge(1 (3)), ge(2 (3))} = gm(1 (3) 2 (3)), {ge((3)), gm((6))} =zm11 (3) d(6). (2.14) similar idea employed cs-theory = 3, gave rise certain conformal models boundary ane symmetries . nontrivial consistency check one verify jacobi-identity satised. interesting one 4 {ge(1 (3)), {ge(2 (3)), ge(3 (3))}} + {ge(3 (3)), {ge(1 (3)), ge(2 (3))}} + (2.15) (1 (3) d(2 (3) 3 (3)) + 2 (3) d(3 (3) 1 (3)) + 3 (3) d(1 (3) 2 (3))) = {ge(2 (3)), {ge(3 (3)), ge(1 (3))}} = 2zm11 d(1 (3) 2 (3) 3 (3)) = 0. zm11 3 type iia-theory d=10 would like consider case type iia theory = 10. things sightly complicated, owing increase number elds, main ideas stay same. ten-dimensional lagrangian form l10 = r1l 1 2 1 2 e 3 2 f (2) f(2) 1 2 e f (3) f(3) 1 1 2 e 2 f (4) f(4) 1 2 da(3) da(3) a(2) , (3.1) f(4) = da(3) da(2) a(1), f(3) = da(2) f(2) = da(1). this, follows equations motion antisymmetric tensor scalar elds are: d(e 1 2 f (4)) = f(4) f(3) . d(e f (3)) = f(2) (e 2 f (4)) 1 2 f(4) f(4) , 1 d(e 3 2 f (2)) = f(3) (e 1 2 f (4)) , dd = 1 4 f(4) (e 1 2 f (4)) 1 2 f(3) (e f (3)) 3 4 f(2) (e (3.2) 3 2 f (2)) . let us make following redenitions 1 4 f(4) = b(4), e e 1 2 f(3) = b(3), 3 4 f(2) = b(2), e = b(1), (3.3) introduce following new elds b(6) = b (4), b(7) = b (3), b(8) = b(2), b(9) = b (1). (3.4) terms new elds equations (3.2) written follows h(2) = db(1) = 0, h(3) = db(2) 3 4 b(1) b(2) = 0, h(4) = db(3) + 1 2 b(1) b(3) = 0, 5 (3.5) h(5) = db(4) 1 4 b(1) b(4) b(3) b(2) = 0, h(7) = db(6) + 1 4 b(1) b(6) + b(4) b(3) = 0, h(8) = db(7) 1 2 b(1) b(7) + b(2) b(6) + 1 2 b(4) b(4) = 0, h(9) = db(8) + 3 4 b(1) b(8) + b(3) b(6) = 0, h(10) = db(9) + 1 4 b(4) b(6) + 1 2 b(3) b(7) + 3 4 b(2) b(8) = 0, also introduced new eld-strengths h(2), h(3), h(4), h(5), h(7), h(8), h(9), h(10). stage would like emphasize one-to-one correspondence original equations motion (3.2) system (3.5), provided relations (3.4) satised. indeed, one solve b(1) rst (locally), b(2), b(3), b(4), that, using relations (3.4) b(6), b(7), b(8), b(9), eventually one recovers original system (3.2). turns system (3.5) invariant following gauge transformations b(1) = d, (3.6) b(2) = d(1) + 3 4 (1) b(1) + 3 4 b(2), b(3) = d(2) + 1 2 (2) b(1) 1 2 b(3), b(4) = d(3) + 1 4 (3) b(1) + (2) b(2) + (1) b(3) + 1 2 b(4), b(6) = d5 1 4 5 b(1) (3) b(3) (2) b(4) 1 4 b(6), b(7) = d(6) 1 2 (6) b(1) 5 b(2) (3) b(4) (1) b(6) + 1 2 b(7), b(8) = d(7) 3 4 (7) b(1) 5 b(3) (2) b(6) 3 4 b(8), b(9) = d(8) 3 4 (7) b(2) + 1 2 (6) b(3) 1 4 5 b(4) 1 4 (3) b(6) 1 2 (2) b(7) 3 4 (1) b(8), , (1), (2), (3), 5, (6), (7), (8) arbitrary p-forms appropriate degree. actually innitesimal form transformations, good enough purposes. another way say transformations (3.6) leave system (3.5) invariant claim eld-strengths hi transform covariantly, namely transform other, checked direct calculation. would like apply idea = 11 supergravity type iia theory. let us consider following lagrangian eleven-dimensional spacetime 6 l = 1 2 (b(6) db(4) b(4) db(6)) 1 2 (b(3) db(7) + b(7) db(3)) (3.7) + 1 2 (b(8) db(2) b(2) db(8)) 1 2 (b(1) db(9) + b(1) db(9)) 1 4 b(6) b(1) b(4) b(6) b(3) b(2) 1 2 b(7) b(1) b(3) 3 4 b(8) b(1) b(2) 1 2 b(4) b(4) b(3). nice consistency check, one derive following formal identity dl = h(7) h(5) h(10) h(2) h(8) h(4), (3.8) using denitions (3.5). evident lagrangian (3.7) obtained descent process thirteen-dimensional spacetime. first gauge transformations (3.6) lagrangian (3.7) transforms total derivative; example (8) transformations give rise following term l = 1 2 d(d(8) b(1) + db(9)). (3.9) transformations produce similar results, namely always sum two terms wedge product derivative gauge parameter eld complementary degree. therefore boundary eleven-dimensional spacetime gauge invariance; otherwise lost. course, restore gauge invariance imposing appropriate boundary conditions elds gauge parameters. surprisingly, turn equations (3.4), plus corresponding conditions gauge- parameters, namely d(8) = d, d(7) = d(1), on. also following procedure described second section, namely integrating certain terms parts, get action eleven-dimensional bulk plus boundary terms (b (4) b(4) + b (3) b(3) + b (2) b(2) + b (1) b(1)) (3.10) = 1 2zm11 + zm11 (b(6) db(4) b(7) db(3) + b(8) db(2) b(9) db(1) 1 4 b(6) b(1) b(4) b(6) b(3) b(2) 1 2 b(7) b(1) b(3) 3 4 b(8) b(1) b(2) 1 2 b(4) b(4) b(3)). now, let us evaluate equations motion b(9), b(8), b(7), b(6) bulk, imply rest elds pure gauge (everywhere, including boundary). integrating terms parts, obtain lagrangian boundary identical 7 one type iia theory = 10, pure gauge degrees freedom bulk become dynamical. remark presumably procedure carried even quantum (functional integral) level, since b(9), b(8), b(7), b(6) elds simply play role lagrange multipliers. thus integrations elds produce delta-functions impose b(1), b(2), b(3), b(4) gauge elds at, pure gauge. associated redenitions variables may give rise non-trivial jacobians functional integral measure, turn may produce dynamics metric boundary. tempting conjecture jacobians eventually produce einstein-hilbert curvature term boundary, theory describing needed produce complete supergravity action boundary, including gravity. clearly issues require careful investigation. 4 type iib-theory d=10 covariant lagrangian type iib supergravity, since includes self-dual 5-form eld strength. however one write covariant equations motion. order make manifest global sl(2, ir) symmetry, useful rst assemble dilaton axion 2 2 matrix: = e e e e + 2 e! also, dene sl(2, ir)-invariant matrix 1 = 0 1 0! , two-component column vector 2-form potentials a(2) = a1 (2) a2 (2)! .
