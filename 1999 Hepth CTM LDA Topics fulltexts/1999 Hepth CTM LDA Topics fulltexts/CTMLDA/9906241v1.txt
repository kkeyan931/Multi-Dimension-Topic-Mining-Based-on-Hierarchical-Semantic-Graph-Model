abstract

solution is presented to the simplest problem about the vacuum backreaction

on a pair creating source. the backreaction eect is nonanalytic in the coupling

constant and restores completely the energy conservation law. the vacuum changes

the kinematics of motion like relativity theory does and imposes a new upper bound

on the velocity of the source.

the phenomenon of the vacuum instability caused by nonstationary external elds re-

ceived much attention owing to its signicance in the black hole physics (see the references

in [1]) but the phenomenon itself is quite general. a charged source of a nonstationary

eld is capable of creating from the vacuum real particles having the same type of charge

(electrical, gravitational, etc.). when the frequency of the source exceeds the threshold

of pair creation, it emits a ux of energy and charge carried by the created particles.

however, the problem with external eld is physically incomplete since it does not answer

the question where the energy of the created particles comes from. it is clear that the

vacuum particle production is only a mechanism of the energy transfer. the energy comes

ultimately from the source of the external eld, and there emerges a question: how much

energy can be extracted from a source through the vacuum mechanism?

an attempt to answer this question without taking into account the backreaction of

the vacuum on the motion of the source leads only to a contradiction with the energy

conservation law. the radiation of black holes is only one (although the most glaring)

example. typically, the radiation rate grows unboundedly with the energy of the source,

and, at a suciently high energy, the source appears to give more than it has. this is the

case even in qed [1,2].

of course, one expects that the corrections stemming from the self-consistent equations

for the expectation values of the eld will remove the contradiction but one should realize

that the vacuum radiation is a purely quantum eect, and, therefore, a quantum correction

to the external eld will result only in a higher-order correction to the radiation energy.

the backreaction eect capable of restoring the energy conservation law can only be

nonanalytic in the coupling constant.

below i present the solution of the self-consistent problem for the simplest model of a

pair creating source. the question receives an answer but the signicance of this answer

seems to surpass the signicance of the question.

the model is an electrically charged spherical shell expanding in the self eld. below,

r = (t) is the law of expansion of the shell, e and m are the full charge and mass of
the shell, and e is its energy in excess of the rest energy (c = 1).
before some time instant t = tstart the shell was kept at the state of maximum contraction

it is assumed that

2

r = rmin and next was let go. the world line of the shell is shown in fig. 1.

since the shell moves with acceleration, it creates particles from the vacuum.

it

radiates at a short stage of its evolution near t = tstart where the acceleration is maximum.
the bigger the energy e, the bigger is this acceleration, and the more violent is the creation
of particles. therefore, it is interesting to consider the ultrarelativistic shell (e/m)  1.
without predetermining the law of motion (t), one may assume that the shell expands
monotonically with an increasing velocity which at t =  reaches some nite value
(). then () may serve as a measure at late time of the acceleration at tstart. as
(e/m)  , the velocity (t) approaches 1 at all t except in a small sector near t = tstart.
the world line of the shell approaches then the broken line in fig. 1. these assumptions

are valid for the classical motion of the shell, and they cannot be invalidated by the

quantum corrections since these corrections are small.

let e and e be the energy and charge emitted by the shell for the whole its history.
using the methods of refs. [1,2], these quantities can be calculated with an arbitrary law

of motion (t). for the ultrarelativistic motion under the assumptions above the result

where o(1) denotes the terms that remain nite as ()  1, and 2 > 0 is the constant
of coupling of the electromagnetic eld of the shell to the vacuum charges (8 times the ne
structure constant for the electron-positron vacuum). inserting in (1) the () calculated

which manifestly contradicts the energy conservation law.

the self-consistent problem to be solved for obtaining the correct result is as follows.

any spherically symmetric electromagnetic eld is determined by a single function e(t, r)

1in the high-frequency approximation [2] which in the present case is provided by the condition

(e/m )  1, the radiation ux does not depend on the mass of the vacuum particles.

3

which is the charge contained at the time instant t inside the sphere of radius r. in terms

of this function, the electric eld e and electromagnetic current j are respectively of the

form

e =

e(t, r)

,

4r2j = (cid:16)r


t

+ t


r(cid:17)e(t, r) .

(4)

the e(t, r) must satisfy the condition of regularity of the electric eld at r = 0 , e(t, 0) = 0,
and the normalization condition e(t,) = e. with these boundary conditions one is to
solve the expectation-value equations

with the retarded resolvent 1/(2  ) [1,2]. in (5)-(6), m is the mass of the vacuum
particles, and j

bare is expressed through

by the same formula as in (4). the set of equations is closed by adding the equation of

e bare(t, r) = e  (r  (t))

motion of the shell

where, as appropriate for the charged surface, the force exerted on the shell is determined

e(t) = e(t, (t)  0)

.

(9)

reserving the procedure of solving for an extended publication, i shall present only

the nal result. the solution for the force in (8) is

e+(t) + e(t) = e + e

2
24

log(cid:16)1  2(t)(cid:17) + 2o(1)

.

(10)

since 2 is small, and o(1) is uniformly bounded, the term 2o(1) in (10) can be discarded.

the force of the vacuum backreaction depends on the velocity. nevertheless, the equation

of motion (8) with this force admits the energy integral:

(11)

which at 2 = 0 goes over into the classical law (2). there is no problem with the

singularity of the integral in (11). it is never reached. like in (2), for a given energy, the
velocity  reaches its maximum value at  =  but the value is now dierent:

like in (2), () grows with e/m but not up to 1:
2 (cid:19) ,

() = 1 

24

2

exp(cid:18)

m  

and this is the principal consequence of the vacuum backreaction.

the insertion of (13) in (1) restores the conservation laws:

=

e
e

e
e

+ 2o(1) ,

(12)

(13)

(14)

up to 50% of energy and charge can be extracted from a source by raising its initial

energy. but the main result is, of course, (11). the vacuum doesnt change the electric

potential as one could expect. it changes the kinematics of motion like relativity theory

does. furthermore, within a given type of coupling, this change is universal. it does not

depend on the parameters of the source, only on the coupling constant 2. the vacuum

appears as a medium in which the velocity of light is less than c but there is one special

thing about this medium: it cannot be escaped.

like the vacuum radiation itself, its backreaction is a semiclassical eect, and the

avoidance of the ultraviolet problem deserves a note. this problem manifests itself in the

fact that the distribution e(t, r) that solves the expectation-value equations is singular on

the shells surface:

(fig. 2). nevertheless, the force exerted on the shell is nite and is unambigously obtained

e(t, r)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r(t)0

= e

2
24

log |r  (t)|

(15)

by making the sum (10) in the spectral integral. this is equivalent to giving the shell

a compton width. the ultraviolet problem concerns the spacelike vicinity of the shell

but not its motion. it is important that the innite jump of e(t, r) across the shell is

5

constant. owing to this fact, the uxes across the shell are nite, and so is the force of

their backreaction.

another object of worry is the vicinity of r = 0 since rmin = (e2/2e) while e increases.
however, one can consider two procedures of raising the energy: keeping e xed and

keeping rmin xed. only in the rst case does the shell probe small scales whereas the

results above are the same in both cases. the details of radiation at early time may be

sensitive to the small scales but the resultant distribution of charges at late time may not.

to the author its hospitality and support. the appearance of eq.

(11) in princeton

is noteworthy. the work was supported in part also by the russian foundation for
