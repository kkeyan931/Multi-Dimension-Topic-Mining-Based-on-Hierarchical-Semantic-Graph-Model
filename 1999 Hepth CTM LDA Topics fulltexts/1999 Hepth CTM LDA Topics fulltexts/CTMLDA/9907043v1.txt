abstract

utilizing the previously established general formalism for quantum
symmetry reduction in the framework of loop quantum gravity the
spectrum of the area operator acting on spherically symmetric states
in 4 dimensional pure gravity is investigated.

the analysis requires a careful treatment of partial gauge xing in
the classical symmetry reduction and of the reinforcement of su (2)-
gauge invariance for the quantization of the area operator. the eigen-
values of that operator applied to the spherically symmetric spin net-
work states have the form

an  pn(n + 2), n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,

giving an  n for large n.
the result claries (and reconciles!) the relationship between the
more complicated spectrum of the general (non-symmetric) area op-
erator in loop quantum gravity and the old bekenstein proposal that
an  n.

1 introduction

in a preceding paper [1] we proposed a framework for implementing symmetry
reductions for gravitational systems quantized within the loop quantum grav-
ity approach (see the reviews [2]). in the present note we apply that frame-
work to the spectrum of the operator associated with 2-dimensional areas.
the problem is of considerable physical interest because the 2-dimensional
horizon of a schwarzschild black hole constitutes such a system the area of
which is, up to a factor, a measure for the entropy of the black hole.

the quantum area spectrum of the horizon of (schwarzschild) black holes
in 4-dimensional space-time has a longer history: already in 1974 bekenstein,
using bohr-sommerfeld type arguments [3], suggested that the area a =
4r2
s, rs = 2gm 2/c2 of a (spherically symmetric) schwarzschild black hole
of mass m has an angular momentum like quantum area spectrum, a(n) 
n, n  n  {n = 1, 2, . . .}, yielding an energy spectrum en  n. in the
meantime such a spectrum has been argued for by many authors (for details
and the corresponding literature see refs. [4, 5, 6]).

a very recent group theoretical quantization based on the classical canon-
ical structure of the schwarzschild system in d ( 4) space-time dimensions
and the group so(1, 2) yields the spectrum [7]

ad2(k; n)  (k + n), n  n0  {n = 0, 1, 2, . . .} ,

(1)

where k characterizes the irreducible unitary representation of so(1, 2) or
its covering groups: for so(1, 2) itself we have k  n, for its two-fold
coverings su(1, 1) = sl(2, r) k  (1/2)n and for the universal covering
group k may be any real number > 0.
on the other hand the spectrum of the general (non-symmetric) area
operator in loop quantum gravity is more complicated [8, 9, 10]: possible
eigenvalues of the area operator in this theory are

a  xp qjp(jp + 1) ,

(2)

where p labels points at which the surface is intersected by a spin network
and jp  1
n0 is the spin of the edge intersecting the surface in p. here we
have ignored the singular case that the surface is intersected in a vertex of
the spin network.

2

there is an important dierence between the spectra (1) and (2): whereas
for the former the distance between successive eigenvalues remains the same

2

for any n that distance becomes smaller and smaller with increasing area
for the spectrum (2) [10]. this result has led to expressions of doubts [12,
13, 2, 14] as to the physical validity of the spectrum (1) and its possible
implications for the structure of the semi-classical hawking radiation [15].

using the framework of ref. [1] we shall show how the spectra (1) and

(2) are related and how the two approaches are to be reconciled:

an observation to start with is that the spectrum (2) contains the other
spectrum (1) as a subset: if there are n edges intersecting the surface, all
labeled with the same spin, e.g. j = 1
2, then the area eigenvalue will be
an  n. in ref. [16] the horizon has been treated in loop quantum gravity
as a boundary with appropriate boundary conditions which x a direction
in the internal su(2)-space thereby breaking su(2) to u(1). this eects
a replacement of the casimir operator j 2 with eigenvalues j(j + 1) labeling
irreducible representations of su(2) by the parameter n labeling irreducible
representations of u(1). according to ref. [11] this leads to a spectrum
n0 which is again of a form of the old area spectrum (1).
furthermore, it has been argued in ref. [11] that the loop quantum gravity
area operator of refs. [8, 10] measures the area of surfaces including all uc-
tuations, with the restricting boundary condition, however, that transversal
uctuations are suppressed at the horizon: the direction of the normal to
the surface cannot uctuate.

a  pp jp  1

2

such a boundary condition is analogous to the situation in a symme-
try reduced model: by imposing, e.g. spherical symmetry one allows only
for symmetric solutions and therefore only for uctuations respecting that
symmetry.

in the present note we, accordingly, analyze properties of the area opera-
tor in a spherically symmetric sector of loop quantum gravity along the lines
suggested in [1]. analogously to corresponding boundary conditions at the
horizon, the classical symmetry reduction involves a reduction of the gauge
group from su(2) to u(1). this is means a partial gauge xing, which will
be undone in the quantum theory.

in the next section we shall summarize the essential steps characterizing
the classical spherical symmetry reduction and the corresponding setup for
the quantum theory. section 3 contains an analysis of the spectrum of the
area operator respecting spherical symmetry. it has the form

a  pj(j + 1)

(no sum over punctures) .

(3)

properties of that spectrum are discussed in the nal section.

2 symmetry reduction

and partial gauge fixing

the quantum symmetry reduction of ref. [1] uses the classication of sym-
metric principal bre bundles and invariant connections thereon [17, 18, 19].
in this framework a symmetry group s acts on a principal bre bundle
p (, g, ) with compact structure group g over the base manifold  which
is a spacelike hypersurface of the space-time used to carry out the canoni-
cal formalism. the symmetry group is a nite-dimensional subgroup of the
group of bundle automorphisms, i.e. it commutes with the right action of g
on p . of special importance is the isotropy subgroup which here is assumed
to be the same for all points in p (if not, the base manifold can be decom-
posed into components all having the same isotropy subgroup. this amounts
to cutting out symmetry centers and axes).

the isotropy subgroup f < s of points in p acts on each bre and
therefore determines a homomorphism p: f  g by f (p) =: p  p(f ) for all
f  f and p  p . homomorphisms p and pg related to dierent points in
the same bre dier only by conjugation: pg = ad g1p for g  g. by the
action of s the base manifold  becomes an orbit bundle  = b  s/f with
base manifold b = /s and orbits s/f . by choosing an analytic section
in this orbit bundle the base b can be embedded analytically in . the
bundle p can be restricted to a principal bre bundle p|b over b, which can
be further reduced by dening q := {p  p|b : p = }. this reduction
uses a xed homomorphism : f  g, and the reduced bundles are principal
bre bundles over b with structure group z := zg((f )), the centralizer
in g of (f ). all symmetric principal bre bundles p are classied by a
conjugacy class [] of homomorphisms and a reduced bundle q. as noted
above, the homomorphisms p get conjugated by changing the point p in the
bre. therefore, all homomorphisms in the conjugacy class [] are equivalent
for classifying the symmetric bundle p ; selecting one of them amounts to a
partial gauge xing breaking the structure group g down to z.

analogously an invariant connection  on a symmetric bre bundle, clas-
sied by  and q, leads to a z-connection on q by restriction. to see
that x a point p  p and a vector v in tpp . then the pull back of
 by f  f applied to v is by denition f p(v) = f (p)(df (v)).
if we
now use the fact that f acts as gauge transformation in the bres and ob-
serve the denition of p and the adjoint transformation of , we obtain

4

f (p)(df (v)) = ad p(f )1p(v) (p annihilates by denition the horizontal
part of v, which only is changed by df ). by assumption the connection 
is s-invariant implying f p(v) = ad p(f )1p(v) = p(v). this shows that
p(v)  zg(p(f )), and  can be restricted to a connection on the bundle
q with structure group z.
besides the reduced connection on q there are several scalar elds,
jointly denoted as higgs eld in the following, which stem from the compo-
nents of  tangential to the s-orbits. the reduced connection together with
the higgs eld suce to classify the invariant connection completely:  can
be reconstructed out of this data. this observation was exploited in ref. [1]
by using the reconstruction map to pull back a cylindrical function on the
space of connections over , i.e. a function in the auxiliary hilbert space of
the unreduced gauge theory, to a function on the space of connections and
higgs elds over b. however, the reduction of the structure group had to be
undone to carry out the quantization procedure in the general framework. in
the following we will describe this in more detail for the example of spherical
symmetry.

we saw that the classication of symmetric bundles and invariant connec-
tions makes use of a partial gauge xing by choosing   []. however, the
full g-transformations are implemented by acting on the classifying struc-
ture: z-gauge transformations are gauge transformations on the reduced
bundle q; they constitute the reduced gauge group. all elements of g
which are not contained in z change  by conjugation. they change the re-
duced bundles in an equivalence class, all of which yield the same symmetric
bundle after reconstruction.

from now on we specialize to s = su(2) = g, f = u(1) in order
to describe spherically symmetric solutions of general relativity in the real
ashtekar formulation. in this case selecting one   [] amounts to xing
an internal axis (a point in s2) and z-gauge transformations are rotations
around this axis, whereas a conjugation of  rotates the axis. the group
g = su(2) = s3 acting on  by conjugation has the isotropy subgroup
z = u(1). factoring out this subgroup leads to the hopf map s3  s2. the
spacelike section  of space-time is by the action of s an orbit bundle with
s2-bres over the one-dimensional base manifold b, which can be embedded
in  as a radial manifold by choosing a section in the orbit bundle.

we can represent f = exph3i (hi denotes the linear span) as subgroup
of s, where j =  i
2 j are su(2)-generators with the pauli matrices j.
then all conjugacy classes of homomorphisms : f  g are given by their

5

representatives k: exp(t3) 7 exp(kt3), k  n0. for k 6= 1 they lead to
degenerate sectors of vanishing volume (see ref. [1] for details) and we will
be mainly concerned with the (k = 1)-sector in the following. this is the only
sector exhibiting a non-vanishing higgs eld; the symmetry reduction leads to
the well known connections which are symmetric up to gauge transformations
[20].

the only su(2)-gauge transformations xing 1 are generated by 3, all
other gauge transformations change  in its conjugacy class. in this 3-gauge
we have d1(3) = 3, whereas in an arbitrary -gauge,   [1], we have
d(3) = g13g, g  su(2). in order to characterize this general gauge by
coordinates we parameterize su(2) by euler angles: g = g3()g1()g3()
where gi(t) := exp ti. this yields

d(3) = sin  sin  1 + sin  cos  2 + cos  3 =: nii

with ni ni  ~n2 = 1, ni = ijnj .

fixed ~n corresponding to a xed   [1] is analogous to a xed direction
in su(2) introduced in [11]. however, as shown above, a chosen ~n repre-
sents pure gauge and physical states and observables should, of course, be
independent of the choice.

the classical phase space of the symmetry reduced theory consists of elds
(ai, ei), 1  i  3, where a1 is the component of the reduced connection
over b, e1 is its conjugate momentum, and a2, a3 are higgs eld components
with conjugate momenta e2, e3. we will be concerned only with a1, e1
because the 2-dimensional area a is classically given by

a = 4|e1| .

(4)

in the -gauge we have the u(1)-connection form

a1 nii dx ,

where x is a (local) coordinate on b, and the lu(1)-valued eld e1 nii.
their symplectic structure is given by

{a1(x), e1(y)} =


4

(x, y)

(5)

with  = 8g and the immirzi parameter .

6

without partial gauge xing the elds would be su(2)-valued and given

by

with

aii dx and ei i

a1 = a sin a sin a, a2 = a sin a cos a, a3 = a cos a,
e1 = e sin e sin e, e2 = e sin e cos e, e3 = e cos e,

in spherical coordinates and with symplectic structure

{ai(x), ej(y)} =


4

i
j(x, y) .

(6)

(the indices i = 1 in eq. (5) denote space indices whereas the indices i, j in
eq. (6) are su(2) indices which are lowered or raised in terms of the killing
metric (ij).) by using the spherical coordinates we can symplectically embed
the phase space (a1, e1) in -gauge as a ray in the phase space of su(2)-
valued elds: a1 7 a1 ni = ai, e1 7 e1 ni = ei with a = e and
a = e xed such that the direction of ni is given by the angles a, a.
if starting quantization from the phase space (a1, e1) we would arrive
at u(1)-spin networks. however, this renders the partial gauge xing mani-
fest and even worse, a higgs eld cannot be included easily in higgs vertices
using the framework of ref. [21] because it transforms in the adjoint repre-
sentation of su(2), not of u(1) which is, of course, the trivial representation.
as described in ref. [1] we can undo the partial gauge xing in the quan-
tum theory by extending the spin networks by su(2)-gauge invariance to
spin network functions on the space of su(2)-connections and appropriate
higgs elds over b. the spin network functions then depend not only on a1
(and higgs eld components) but on all su(2)-components ai introduced
above. accordingly, the su(2)-components ei get quantized to functional
derivatives

ei(x) =


4i


ai (x) .

this will be crucial for the quantization of the area operator.

before addressing that problem we mention that the extension to su(2)-
invariant spin networks can be understood as integrating the partial gauge
xings ~n over s2 for any edge in the graph underlying the spin network state.
in order to make this precise we use coherent states on su(2) introduced in

7

ref. [22]: these are dened for a xed irreducible representation of su(2)
with weight j and a state |j, mi therein by

|m, ~nij := (j)(g3()g1())|j, mi ,

for all ~n  s2.

(7)

here (j) is the irreducible su(2)-representation of weight j, and ,  are
coordinates of ~n in s2. these coherent states are (over-)complete for any
xed j, m, namely

2j + 1

4 zs 2

d2n|m, ~nij hm, ~n|j = (j)(1)

(8)

is the identity operator in the j-representation. we can now project each
edge holonomy in an su(2)-spin network to a u(1)-holonomy by inserting
the projector |m, ~nij hm, ~n|j in each edge with spin j, where m ;j  m  j
is arbitrary but xed (for each j). at this point there arises an arbitrariness
because any su(2)-representation splits into several representations (labeled
by m) of a u(1)-subgroup. this yields the holonomies of a u(1)-spin net-
work in the -gauge where  can be chosen arbitrarily for each edge (in the
classication one uses only  which are constant along b for simplicity. such
a choice is always possible by choosing an appropriate section in p|b. how-
ever,  is dened by the action of f in each point of p and can, of course,
vary in dierent points). note, however, that we have no such projection
procedure for higgs vertices; a projection of a full spin network and, there-
fore, a partial gauge xing in the quantum theory can completely be done
only in the degenerate sectors which have no higgs vertices [1].

arrived at a u(1)-spin network (and disregarding higgs vertices), we can
multiply the corresponding states for each edge with (4)1(2j + 1) and
integrate ~n over s2. using the completeness relation (8) we see that we get
back the original su(2)-spin network.

3 area operator

before quantizing the (spherically symmetric) area operator without gauge
xing let us rst rephrase the results of ref. [11] in terms of our framework
by using the coherent states (7) and quantize the area in its -gauge xed
form:

the angular component of the metric tensor is given by |e1|d2, which
leads to the classical expression a(x) = 4|e1(x)| for the area of a s2-orbit

8

intersecting the radial manifold b in the point x (in a spherically symmetric
theory these are the only surfaces whose area can be dened). writing

a(x) = 4|e1(x)ni ni| = 4|ei(x) ni|

we can readily quantize it on a gauge xed edge (projected from a su(2)-edge
of spin j) containing x by using

ni ei(x) :=


4 |m, ~nij ni ji hm, ~n|j =

l2
p
4

m|m, ~nij hm, ~n|j

where ji is the angular momentum operator acting on the coherent state.

however, this quantization depends on what quantum number m we
choose for the projection by means of the coherent state. we can justify
the choice m = j by demanding that we should be able to recover the spin
of the edge uniquely from the projected data. the simplest way of doing so
is given by such a selection of m(j), namely choosing m = j is analogous to
the extremization used in ref. [11]. in this way we get the spectrum

1
2

 l2
p

n0

for the operator, analogously to ref. [11].

however, in doing so we have used a partial gauge xing which, as dis-
cussed above, is inappropriate in the non-degenerate sector because of the
higgs vertices. if x is a higgs vertex then we cannot use this operator because
we cannot project at that point to a u(1)-spin network. this quantization
is appropriate only in the degenerate sectors discussed in ref. [1].

we now (nally!) quantize the area in the non-degenerate sector by using
su(2)-gauge invariant spin networks and at the same time undoing any -
gauge xing. we begin by rewriting the area into the form

a(x) = 4|e1(x)| = 4p(e1)2 ni ni = 4peiei

(9)

which is similar to the area

a(sx) = zsx

d2peiei

of the orbit sx intersecting b in x in the non-symmetric theory.

9

from now on we can proceed analogously to the quantization of the area
operator in the non-symmetric theory [10]. as discussed in the last section,
ei gets quantized to

l2
p
4i


ai

which acts on the su(2)-holonomy he = p expre dxaii along the edge
e: [0, 1]  b.
in order to consider a general point x which can be a higgs vertex we
assume that each edge containing x starts in x. we then have two outgoing
radial edges, one oriented like b itself which we denote as e+ and one oriented
oppositely to b which we denote as e, and possibly a higgs vertex in x which
does not depend on ai and which can be understood as representing edges
tangential to the surface sx. by applying the functional derivative /ai(x)
to a cylindrical function f with  containing the edges e+, e and the higgs
vertex x we get

ei(x)f =

(11)

(12)

here the edges e+ and e carry the spin j+ and j, respectively, and jv
labels the vertex contractor: if x is a higgs vertex the associated higgs point
holonomy labeled by a spin j can be visualized as a loop with spin j based in
x. this is in accordance with the gau constraint which can be regularized
to a sum of invariant vector elds containing a left (j (l)
h ) and a right (j (r)
h )
invariant one for the higgs eld [1]:

je+ + je =: jev = j (l)

h  j (r)
h .

10

thus x becomes a 4-vertex whose contractor can be determined by splitting
the vertex into two 3-vertices with a new edge ev connecting the edges e+ and
e with the higgs loop. it is labeled by the spin jv appearing in the eigenvalue
of the area operator. of course, the higgs loop as well as the jv-edge have no
spatial extension in the manifold b. because the higgs eld contributes by
left and right invariant vector elds leading to the loop the spin jv can only
be integer valued. this fact has an immediate consequence on the topology-
dependence of the area operator discussed in the next section. here we note
that in an appropriate topology of  the area spectrum is given by all values
of the form (12) where jv  n0 and j+  1
n0 are arbitrary whereas j is
restricted by |j+  jv|  j  j+ + jv. in general, however, the topology can
impose restrictions on the possible values of the form (12) occurring in the
area spectrum.

2

4 discussion

the above area operator in the spherically symmetric sector which we ob-
tained by restoring the full su(2)-gauge invariance resembles the one in the
non-symmetric theory. the only, however crucial, dierence comes from the
simpler topology of one-dimensional graphs. therefore we have no sum over
vertices lying on the surface, but only one vertex which represents the whole
surface. this dierence inuences the area spectrum considerably: disre-
garding vertex contributions we get the spectrum

a(j) =  l2

ppj(j + 1) ,

1
2

j 

n0 ,

(13)

which is only a small subset of the corresponding spectrum (2) in the non-
symmetric theory. in particular, for large j the spectrum becomes not dense,
but equidistant, and in the large j limit we obtain the spectrum (1) of the
horizon area described in the introduction.

thus we have shown that loop quantum gravity in its spherically symmet-
ric sector reproduces for large spins, i.e. in the assumed semiclassical regime,
the older results while it leads to corrections for small j, i.e. at the planck
scale.

as in the case of the area operator in the non-symmetric theory the spec-
trum of the spherically symmetric one depends on the topology of space.
here any surface whose area we can measure in a spherically symmetric the-
ory has, of course, the topology of s2. however, there are essentially two

11

possible space topologies: a topology with two (or more) boundary com-
ponents and second homology h2() = z, and one with a single boundary
component and h2() = 0 (we regard spatial innity as a boundary). in the
rst case we have two physical realizations: the wormhole topology b = r,
 = r  s2 represents a spacelike hypermanifold in the kruskal extension
of schwarzschild (or reissner-nordstrm) space-time and has two boundary
components at , whereas the topology b = r+,  = r3\{0} can be seen
as simulating an external, non-dynamical gravitational source sitting in the
origin, i.e. in one of the two boundary components of .

()

the topology with only one boundary component is given by b = r+ 
{0},  = r3 and has only the boundary at spacelike innity. here we have
to treat the symmetry center in 0 along the general framework of symmetry
reduction. the isotropy subgroup is f = s = su(2) and the homomorphism
1 : g 7 g  {1}  g\{1} = so(3) or
: f  g is either 0: g 7 1, 
1: g 7 g (up to conjugacy) for all g  s. this can be seen from the fact
that the kernel of  is an invariant subgroup of s which can only be s, {1}
or {1}. by continuity, in the rest of b we must use the homomorphism
()
k if in 0 we use k (
1 and 1 make no dierence). this shows that we
have only the possibilities k = 0, 1 if the symmetry center is contained in .
the two possibilities lead to manifestly invariant connections (k = 0) and to
connections invariant up to gauge (k = 1). in all these cases there can be
no higgs eld in 0, which is in accordance with the fact that the higgs eld
represents components of an invariant connection tangential to the s-orbits
which is a single point in the case of 0. an immediate consequence of this
fact is that f = s, which implies lf = {0} (in the cartan-killing metric)
and therefore the higgs eld which is a map :lf  lg vanishes.
we can now consider the implications of these considerations as to gauge
invariant spin networks. the crucial observation is that in a higgs vertex the
spins of the neighboring edge holonomies can dier only by an integer value
because the spin jv mentioned above is integer-valued due to the higgs loop
in the vertex. if  has two boundary components we do not have to enforce
su(2)-gauge invariance in the two boundary points of b and the edges can
be either all integer valued or all half-integer valued. this leads to the full
spectrum (12) given above. however, if 0  b corresponds to the symmetry
center, i.e. an inner point of  implying that there can lie no higgs vertex,
we have to impose su(2)-gauge invariance in 0. the edge incident in 0 can
only have spin 0 which implies that the other edge spins can only be integer

12

valued. this fact allows only a subset of (12) as area spectrum.

as a last remark we note that the spectroscopy for spherically symmetric
black holes (cf. e.g. [4]) is unaltered by our area spectrum (13) because it
becomes uniformly spaced for large j, like the spectrum (1). this is not
the case for the full area spectrum (2) of the non-symmetric theory which
becomes almost continuous.

the large discrepancy between these two spectra may be understood as a
line splitting due to a broken symmetry. because of the discrete structure of
space made explicit by a spin network spherical symmetry is strongly broken
by a state in the non-symmetric theory. as is well known in quantum theory,
breaking a symmetry can lead to a splitting of levels which are degenerate
before breaking the symmetry. in our case the degeneracy of the levels of
a black hole is expected to be very huge, growing exponentially with j (see
section 3 of ref. [6] and the literature mentioned there). splitting of these
strongly degenerate levels by a broken symmetry may lead to an almost con-
tinuous spectrum as observed in the non-symmetric theory. this observation
may also open up a new way to calculate the degeneracy of the energy levels
of black holes in loop quantum gravity.
