the vortex picture of connement is studied. the deconnement phase
transition is explained as a transition from a phase in which vortices
percolate to a phase of small vortices. lattice results are presented in
support of this scenario. furthermore the topological properties of magnetic
monopoles and center vortices arising, respectively, in abelian and center
gauges are studied in continuum yang-mills-theory. for this purpose the
continuum analog of the maximum center gauge is constructed.

introduction

recent lattice calculations have given strong evidence for two connement scenarios:
1. the dual meissner eect [1], which is based on a condensate of magnetic
monopoles in the qcd vacuum and 2. the center vortex picture [2], where the
vacuum consists of a condensate of magnetic ux tubes which are closed due to
the bianchi identity. there are also lattice calculations which indicate that the
spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, which can be related to the topology
of gauge elds, is caused by these objects, i.e. by either magnetic monopoles
[5] or center vortices [6]. in this talk we would like to discuss the connement
and topological properties of magnetic monopoles and center vortices. we will
rst discuss the two connement scenarios based on magnetic monopoles and
vortices, respectively, and subsequently investigate the topological properties of
these objects. in particular, we will study the nature of the deconnement phase
transition in the center vortex picture. we will also show that in polyakov gauge
the magnetic monopoles completely account for the non-trivial topology of the
gauge elds. subsequently, we will extend the notion of center vortices to the
continuum. we will present the continuum analog of the maximum center gauge
xing and the pontryagin index of center vortices.

2 connement

the magnetic monopoles arise in yang-mills-theories in the so called abelian
gauges [7]. recent lattice calculations have shown that below a critical temperature

tc these monopoles are condensed [10] and give rise to the dual meiner eect.
in particular in the so called maximal abelian gauge where all links are made
as diagonal as possible, one observes abelian and monopole dominance in the
string tension [1]. however, very recent lattice calculations [11] also show that
the yang-mills ground state does not look like a coulombic monopole gas but
rather indicate a collimation of magnetic ux, which is consistent with the center
vortex picture of connement, proposed in refs. [12], [13], [15], [14].

center vortices represent closed magnetic ux lines in three space dimensions,
describing closed two-dimensional world-sheets in four space-time dimensions.
the magnetic ux represented by the vortices is furthermore quantized such
that a wilson loop linking vortex ux takes a value corresponding to a nontrivial
center element of the gauge group. in the case of su (2) colour the only such
element is (-1). for n colours, there are n  1 dierent possible vortex uxes
corresponding to the n 1 nontrivial center elements of su (n ). center vortices
can be regarded as a fraction of a dirac string: n superimposed center vortices
form an unobservable dirac string.

consider an ensemble of center vortex congurations in which the vortices
are distributed randomly, specically such that intersection points of vortices
with a given two-dimensional plane in space-time are found at random, uncorrelated
locations. in such an ensemble, connement results in a very simple manner. let
the universe be a cube of length l, and consider a two-dimensional slice of this
universe of area l2, with a wilson loop embedded into it, circumscribing an area
a. on this plane, distribute n vortex intersection points at random, cf. fig. 1
(left). according to the specication above, each of these points contributes a
factor (- 1) to the value of the wilson loop if it falls within the area a spanned
by the loop; the probability for this to occur for any given point is a/l2.

the expectation value of the wilson loop is readily evaluated in this simple
model. the probability that n of the n vortex intersection points fall within
the area a is binomial, and, since the wilson loop takes the value (1)n in the
presence of n intersection points within the area a, its expectaton value is

where in the last step, the size of the universe l has been sent to innity while
leaving the planar density  = n/l2 of vortex intersection points constant.
thus, one obtains an area law for the wilson loop, with the string tension
rvm = 2.

in fact, in lattice calculations the vortex area density  has been shown
to obey the proper scaling behaviour [3] as dictated by the renormalization
group and thus represents a physical observable. using a string tension of

loop. the dots represent the intersection points of the vortices with the plane
considered. left gure: conning vortex ensemble of uncorrelated intersection
points. right gure: deconning vortex ensemble in which the intersection points

of a pair are connected by a line.)

  (440m ev )2 as input one nds   3.4f 2 corresponding to a string
tension rvm = (521m ev )2 in the random model above which overestimates
the input value. this overabundance of string tension can be easily understood
by noticing that there are both dynamical [17] and kinematical correlations
between the vortex intersection points, which have been discarded in the random
vortex model considered above, which assumes that all intersection points are
completely random, i.e. uncorrelated. this is, however, not true since the vortices
are closed loops in d = 3 or closed surfaces in d = 4. therefore the intersection
points in the plane of the wilson loops come in pairs. but a pair of intersection
points does not (non-trivially) contribute to the wilson loop. only for large
vortices exceeding the size of the wilson loop the intersection points inside the
wilson loop are uncorrelated and can contribute (1). on the other hand all
vortices contribute to the area vortex density  measured on the lattice. this
eect leads to a lower value of the string tension than the value rvm = 2
resulting from the random vortex model.

3 deconnement

the above presented vortex picture of connement naturally explains also the
deconnement transition as a transition from a phase of large vortices percolating

3

throughout space-time to a phase of small vortices in a sense to be specied
more precisely below. indeed, assume that all vortices have a maximal size d.
then only the intersection points in a strip of width d along the perimeter of
the wilson loop can randomly contribute (1), (while other intersection points
come in pairs and hence do not contribute). the expectation value of the wilson
loop is then still given by eq. (1), however, with the full area a of the wilson
loop replaced by the area of the strip of width d along the perimeter p of the
wilson loop, d  p , resulting in a perimeter law

< w >= exp(2dp )

(2)

implying deconnement. this picture of the deconnement phase transition
arising in the random vortex model as a transition from a phase of percolating
vortices to a phase of small vortices is supported by the lattice calculations.
fig. 2 shows the vortex matter distribution as function of the vortex cluster
extension at various temperatures for a 3-dimensional slice resulting from the
4-dim. lattice by omitting one spatial direction[18], see also ref. [17]. far below
the critical temperature tc of the deconnement phase transition a dominant
portion of the vortex matter is contained in a big cluster extending over the
whole lattice universe. as the temperature rises smaller clusters are more and
more formed and well above the deconnement phase transition large vortices
have ceased to exist, the connectivity of the clusters is lost and all vortex matter
being contained in small clusters.

if one analyzes the small vortex clusters dominating the deconned phase in
more detail, one nds that a large part of these vortices wind in the (euclidean)
temporal direction, i.e. the space-time direction whose extension is identied
with the inverse temperature. therefore, one nds that the typical congurations
in the two phases can be characterized as displayed in fig. 3 in a three-dimensional
slice of space-time, where one space direction has been left away. note that fig.
3 also furnishes an explanation of the spatial string tension in the deconned
phase. a spatial wilson loop embedded into fig. 3 (right) can exhibit an area law
since intersection points of winding vortices with the minimal area spanned by
the loop can occur in an uncorrelated fashion despite those vortices having small
extension. note also the dual nature of this (magnetic) picture as compared with
electric ux models [19]. in such models, electric ux percolates in the deconned
phase, while it does not percolate in the conning phase.

4 magnetic monopoles and topology

spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry can be triggered by topologically non-
trivial gauge elds, which give rise to zero modes of the quarks [21]. magnetic

which xes v  su (2)/u (1) i.e. the coset part of the gauge group, which we
assume, for simplicity, to be su (2). magnetic monopoles arise as defects of the
gauge xing, which occur when at isolated points in space ~xi the polyakov loop
becomes a center element

(~xi) = (1)ni, ni : integer

(5)

the eld av = v av  + v v  develops then magnetic monopoles located at
these points. these monopoles have topologically quantized magnetic charge [8]
given by the winding number

m[v ]  2(su (2)/u (1))

(6)

of the mapping v (~x) from a sphere s2 around the magnetic monopole into the
coset su (2)/u (1) of the gauge group.

in the polyakov gauge the pontryagin index can be exactly expressed in
terms of magnetic charges [8], [22], [20]. if we assume a compact space-time
manifold and that there are only point-like defects of gauge xing, i.e magnetic
monopoles are the only magnetically charged objects arising after gauge xing,
the pontryagin index is given by [8]

 = inimi

(7)

the summation runs here over all magnetic monopoles with mi being the
magnetic charge of the monopole dened by equation (6) and the integer ni
is dened by the value of the polyakov-loop at the monopole position (5). this
relation shows that the magnetic monopoles completely account for the non-
trivial topology of gauge elds, at least in the polyakov gauge. unfortunately,
in other abelian gauges like maximum abelian gauge, such a simple relation

6

between pontryagin index and magnetic charges is not yet known and perhaps
does not exist [20]. however, in the maximum abelian gauge correlations between
instantons and monopoles have been found, in both analytical and lattice studies
[5].

5 center vortices in the continuum

on the lattice center vortices are detected by going to the maximum center
gauge and subsequently projecting the links onto center elements [2]. in the
maximum center gauge

(t ru(x))2  max ,

xx,

(8)

which is obviously insensitive to center gauge transformations, one exploits the
gauge freedom to rotate a link variable as close as possible to a center element.
once the maximum center gauge has been implemented, center projection implies
to replace all links by their closest center element. one obtains then a z(2)
lattice which contains d  1 dimensional hypersurfaces  on which all links take
a non-trivial center element, that is u = 1 in the case of su (2). the d  2
dimensional boundaries  of the hypersurfaces  represent the center vortices,
which, when non-trivially linked to a wilson loop, yield a center element for the
latter. the notion of center vortices can be extended to the continuum theory
by putting a given smooth gauge eld a(x) on a lattice in the standard fashion
by introducing the link variables u(x) = exp(aa(x)).

a careful analysis shows that the continuum analogies of the center vortices

are dened by the gauge potential [9],

a(x, ) = ez

dd1 d(x  x())

(9)

where dd1  is the dual of the d1 dimensional volume element. furthermore,
the quantity e = eaha with ha being the generators of the cartan algebra
represents (up to a factor of 2) the so called co-weights which satisfy exp(e) =
z  z(n ). due to this fact the wilson-loop calculated from the gauge potential
(9) becomes,

w [a](c) = exp(ic

a) = z i(c,)

(10)

where i(c, ) is the intersection number between the wilson-loop c and the
hypersurface . the representation, (9), is referred to as ideal center vortex.
one should emphasize that the hypersurface  can be arbitrarily deformed
by a center gauge transformation keeping, however, its boundary , i.e. the

7

position of the center vortex, xed. thus for xed  the dependence of the
gauge potential (9) on the hypersurface itself is a gauge artifact.

the dependence on the hypersurface  can be removed by performing the

gauge transformation

(x, ) = exp(e(x, ))

(11)

where (x, ) is the solid angle subtended by the hypersurface  as seen from
the point x. one nds then

where

a(x, ) = (x, )(x, ) + a(x, )

a(x, ) = ez

dd2   d(x  x())

(12)

(13)

depends only on the vortex position  and is referred to as thin vortex.
here d(x  x()) represents the green function of the d dimensional laplacian.
in fact, one can show [9] that the thin vortex represents the transversal part
of the ideal vortex a(x, ) = p a(x, ) where p =   
is the
 2
usual transversal projector. a careful and lengthy analysis [9] yields that the
continuum analog of the maximum center gauge xing is dened by

min


min

g z tr(ag  a())2

(14)

where the minimization is performed with respect to all (continuum) gauge
transformations g  su (2)/z(2) (which represent per se coset gauge transformations)
and with respect to all vortex surfaces . for xed thin center vortex eld
conguration a() minimization with respect to the continuum gauge transformation
g yields the background gauge condition

[ + a(), a] = 0

(15)

where the thin vortex eld a(x, ) gures as background gauge eld. one
should emphasize, however, that the background eld has to be dynamically
determined for each given gauge eld a(x) and thus depends on the latter.
obviously in the absence of a vortex structure in the considered gauge eld
a(x) the background gauge condition reduces to the lorentz gauge a = 0.

6 topology of center vortices

once the center vortex congurations in the continuum are at our disposal,
it is straightforward to calculate their pontryagin index. in the continuum
formulation where center vortices live in the abelian subgroup by construction

8

the direction of the magnetic ux of the vortices is fully kept. the explicit
calculation [9] shows that the pontryagin index  of the center vortices is given
by

 =

1
4

i(, )

(16)

where i(, ) represents the self-intersection number of the closed vortex
sheet  dened by

i(1, 2) =

1

2 z

1

d z

2

d 4 (x()  x()) .

(17)

a careful analysis shows that for closed oriented surfaces the self intersection
number vanishes. in order to have a non-trivial pontryagin index the vortex
surfaces have to be not globally oriented, i.e., they have to consist of oriented
pieces. one can further show that at the border between oriented vortex patches
magnetic monopole currents ow. it is these monopole currents which make the
vortex sheet non-oriented since they change the orientation of the magnetic
ux. thus we obtain that even for the center vortices the non-trivial topology
is generated by magnetic monopole currents owing on the vortex sheets. this
is consistent with our nding in the polyakov gauge (see eq. (7)) where the
pontryagin index was exclusively expressed in terms of magnetic monopoles [8].
in fact, for a compact space-time manifold one can show that under certain mild
assumptions the pontryagin index can be expressed as

 = 

1
4

l(, c) ,

(18)

where l(, c) is the linking number between the vortex  and the monopole
loop c on the vortex.

by implementing the maximum center gauge condition in the continuum one
can derive, in an approximate fashion, an eective vortex theory [9], where the
vortex action can be calculated in a gradient expansion. the leading order gives
the nambu-goto action while in higher orders curvature terms appear. a model
based on such an eective vortex action, in fact, reproduces the gross features
of the center vortex picture found in numerical yang-mills lattice simulations.
