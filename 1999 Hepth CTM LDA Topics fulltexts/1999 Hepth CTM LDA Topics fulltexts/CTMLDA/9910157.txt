kinematic). system tachyons (p 2 = pp+ p 2 0, p0 0), p semi- positive, subspace annihilated p contains translation invariant vacuum state. addition, system massless states (i.e. mass gap), subspace contains states vanishing four-momentum. therefore, light-front formulation, nding vacuum state fock space system kinematic problems. light-front formulation also induces specic kind intuition believed valu- able many physical situations (for review, see refs. {$9802037$}). example, light-front formulation turns closely related innite momentum frame limit , notion constituent quarks . also note light-front formulation nite volume appears discussions recent developments m-theory {$9704080$}. thus, light-front formulation gauge theories and, particular, gluodynamics, worthwhile goal. however, moment, light-front formulation gauge theories less well developed, opinion, conventional equal-time formulation. reason assertion that, overcome technical diculties, light-front formulation
