abstract

we consider non-perturbative four dimensional n = 1 space-time super-
symmetric orientifolds corresponding to type i compactications on (gener-
alized) voisin-borcea orbifolds. some states in such compactications arise
in twisted open string sectors which lack world-sheet description in terms
of d-branes. using type i-heterotic duality as well as the map between type
iib orientifolds and f-theory we are able to obtain the massless spectra of
such orientifolds. the four dimensional compactications we discuss in this
context are examples of chiral n = 1 supersymmetric string vacua which
are non-perturbative from both orientifold and heterotic points of view. in
particular, they contain both d9- and d5-branes as well as non-perturbative
twisted open string sector states. we also explain the origins of various in-
consistencies arising in such compactications for certain choices of the gauge
bundle.

i. introduction

in the recent years much progress has been made in understanding six and four dimen-
sional orientifold compactications. various six dimensional orientifold vacua were con-
structed, for instance, in [14]. generalizations of these constructions to four dimensional
orientifold vacua have also been discussed in detail in [513]. in many cases the perturbative
world-sheet approach to orientifolds gives rise to consistent anomaly free vacua in six and
four dimensions. however, as was pointed out in [11], there are cases where the perturba-
tive orientifold description is inadequate as it misses certain non-perturbative sectors giving
rise to massless states. in certain cases this inadequacy results in obvious inconsistencies
such as lack of tadpole and anomaly cancellation. examples of such cases were discussed in
[911]. in other cases, however, the issue is more subtle as the non-perturbative states arise
in anomaly free combinations, so that they are easier to miss.

thus, let us consider abelian t 6/ orbifold compactications of type i with n = 1
supersymmetry in four dimensions. the requirement that the orbifold group  act crystal-
lographically on t 6 restricts the allowed choices of  to z

z
for   zn  zm . here we use star and prime to distinguish dierent cyclic groups of the
same order which act dierently on t 6 (the precise actions of these orbifold groups on t 6 are
given in the subsequent sections). in some of the above cases type i-heterotic duality en-
ables one to argue along the lines of [7,8,11] that the non-perturbative states become heavy
and decouple once the corresponding orbifold singularities are appropriately blown up. in
6 [13] orbifold cases. as
particular, these are the z
6, z2  z6,
was argued in [11], in other perturbatively tadpole free orientifolds, such as the z
z3  z6 and z6  z6 [9], and z12 [10] orbifold cases, the non-perturbative open string sectors
do give rise to massless states which do not decouple even for blown-up orbifolds. recently
some examples of non-perturbative orientifolds were explicitly constructed in [14]. thus,
the four dimensional example discussed in [14] is based on the z
6 orbifold. the purpose of
this paper, which is the follow-up of [14], is to extend the discussions of [14] to understand
all other orientifold cases as well. in particular, we will discuss the z2  z6, z3  z6, z6  z6
and z12 cases. the rst three cases lead to anomaly free non-perturbative orientifolds. the
last case, however, turns out to suer from a non-perturbative anomaly whose origins we
explain in detail in section v. moreover, we elaborate on the rest of the orbifold compact-
ications mentioned above, namely, the z2  z4 and z4  z4 [9], and z8, z
8 and z12 [10]
cases, which where shown to suer from perturbative tadpoles in [9] and [10], respectively.
in [11] this was explained by considering f-theory duals of these compactications. in this
paper we elaborate the arguments of [11]. in particular, we point out that the corresponding
inconsistencies arise due to the particular choices of the gauge bundle in the models of [9,10]
(these gauge bundles are perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint).

the origin of non-perturbative states in orientifold compactications can already be
understood in six dimensions. thus, in the k3 orbifold examples of [3] the orientifold
projection is not , which we will use to denote that in the smooth k3 case, but rather
j , where j  maps the g twisted sector to its conjugate g1 twisted sector (assuming
g2 6= 1) [15]. geometrically this can be viewed as a permutation of two p1s associated with
each xed point of the orbifold [11]. (more precisely, these p1s correspond to the orbifold

2

blow-ups.) this is dierent from the orientifold projection in the smooth case where (after
blowing up) the orientifold projection does not permute the two p1s. in the case of the
j  projection the twisted open string sectors corresponding to the orientifold elements
j g are absent [16,11]. however, if the orientifold projection is , then the twisted open
string sectors corresponding to the orientifold elements g are present [11]. in fact, these
states are non-perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint and are required for gravitational
anomaly cancellation in six dimensions. in certain cases type i-heterotic duality allows one
to understand such sectors and construct the corresponding models explicitly [14].

in four dimensional orientifolds with n = 1 supersymmetry there are always sectors
(except in the z2  z2 model of [5] which is completely perturbative from the orientifold
viewpoint) such that there is only one p1 per xed point, so only the  orientifold projection
is allowed. this results in non-perturbative twisted open string sectors, which, as we have
already mentioned, decouple in certain cases once the appropriate blow-ups are performed.
in other cases we must include these states to obtain the complete description of a given
orientifold.

some of the non-perturbative orientifolds have perturbative heterotic duals. however,
non-perturbative orientifolds with, say, d5-branes are non-perturbative from the heterotic
viewpoint. in this paper we are therefore exploring some vacua in the region d in fig.1
(which has been borrowed from the second reference in [13]). thus, the z
6 orbifold com-
pactication discussed in [14], as well as the z2  z6 orbifold compactication we discuss
in section v of this paper, are examples of four dimensional chiral n = 1 supersymmetric
string vacua which are non-perturbative from both orientifold and heterotic points of view.
the key point which allows us to understand four dimensional non-perturbative orien-
tifolds discussed in this paper is the fact that these models correspond to type i compacti-
cations on generalized voisin-borcea orbifolds of the form (t 2  k3)/zn (n = 2, 3, 4, 6).
one of the simplifying features of these compactications is that once non-perturbative k3
orientifolds are understood (and this is partially facilitated by the fact that in six dimen-
sions the gravitational anomaly cancellation condition is rather constraining), it is possible
to extend the corresponding results to generalized voisin-borcea compactications. another
nice feature is that, by t-dualizing along t 2, we can map these modes to f-theory compact-
ications on the corresponding calabi-yau four-folds, and the (at least partially) geometric
picture arising in the f-theory context is very helpful in understanding such vacua.

the rest of this paper is organized as follows. in section ii we use the map between type
i compactications on k3 and f-theory on voisin-borcea orbifolds to determine which gauge
bundles are perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint. in section iii we give explicit models
corresponding to k3 compactications of type i with these perturbative gauge bundles. in
section iv we move down to four dimensions and consider type i compactications on
voisin-borcea orbifolds. in particular, using the map between such type i vacua and f-
theory on calabi-yau four-folds we give the constraints necessary for tadpole cancellation
in the cases where the gauge bundle is perturbative. in particular, this discussion relies on
the results of section ii. in section v we discuss type i compactications on generalized
voisin-borcea orbifolds (t 2  k3)/zn with n = 3, 4, 6. in particular, we argue that the z12
case suers from a non-perturbative anomaly. in section vi we discuss some directions for
extending our results. in particular, we consider type i on k3 with non-zero ns-ns b-eld
and the gauge bundles with vector structure.

ii. type i on k3 (orbifolds)

in this section we discuss six dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric type i compactica-
tions on k3. in particular, what we would like to understand here is which choices of the
gauge bundle are perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint. our discussion here applies
to both type i and spin(32)/z2 heterotic compactications on k3, which is due to type
i-heterotic duality. the dictionary between the two descriptions includes mapping 5-branes
on the type i side, which are made of some number of d5-branes, to ns 5-branes (or,
equivalently, small instantons) on the heterotic side.

thus, consider type i on a k3 surface. in order to determine a particular ground state
of the theory, we must specify not only the compactication space, which in this case is
k3, but also the choice of the gauge bundle. thus, in the orientifold description of type i
non-perturbative eects can arise from two dierent sources: (1) the perturbative orientifold
description may fail to capture all states arising due to, say, various singularities in k3 itself;
(2) a given choice of the gauge bundle may not have perturbative orientifold description. the
second source of non-perturbative physics is generally more non-trivial to understand. here,
however, we will be interested in determining which choices of the gauge bundle do possess
perturbative orientifold description, and once we understand this class of gauge bundles, we
can then focus on the rst source of non-perturbative eects which are easier to handle due
to various hints from geometry.

the case of k3 is particularly convenient as (unlike in the case of calabi-yau three-folds)
topologically we are dealing with one surface. this enables us to understand perturbative
gauge bundles in the k3 case by going to orbifold limits which have a simple description.
thus, let us consider orbifold k3s of the form k3 = t 4/zn , where n = 2, 3, 4, 6 are the
choices allowed by the requirement that the orbifold act crystallographically on the four-
torus t 4. let z1, z2 be the complex coordinates parametrizing t 4. then the action of the
generator g of zn is given by

gz1 = z1 ,

gz2 = 1z2 ,

(1)

where   exp(2i/n).

next, consider type i on t 4/zn . we will assume that the (untwisted) ns-ns b-eld
is trivial. then we can view type i on t 4/zn as the  orientifold of type iib on t 4/zn .
(more precisely, the  orientifold is well dened after the appropriate blow-ups of the orbifold
singularities other than z2.) the theory has n = 1 supersymmetry in six dimensions. the
massless spectrum of the closed string sector consists of the gravity supermultiplet, one
tensor supermultiplet, and 20 hypermultiplets (which are neutral under the non-abelian
gauge symmetries in the open string sector).
in the open string sector we have 32 d9-
branes, which is required by the untwisted tadpole cancellation conditions. in the z3 case
we do not have any d5-branes. in the z2, z4, z6 cases tadpole cancellation conditions also
require introduction of 32 d5-branes.

to understand the gauge bundles in all of the above cases, recall that in the case of
k3 anomaly cancellation requires that the number ni of instantons embedded in the gauge
bundle and the number n5 of 5-branes (that is, small instantons) must add up to 24: ni +n5 =
24. in the z3 all 24 instantons are embedded in the gauge bundle, so the number of 5-branes
is zero. this gauge bundle is therefore perturbative from the heterotic viewpoint. on the

4

orientifold side it is dened by the action of the orbifold group on the chan-paton charges
which is given by the following 16  16 matrix1 [3]:

z3 :

g = diag(i4, 1i4, i8) ,

(2)

where   exp(2i/3), and in denotes the n  n identity matrix.

next, consider the z2 case. here we have 32 d5-branes which form n5 = 8 dynamical
5-branes. here two pairings take place - one due to the orientifold projection, and the other
one due the z2 orbifold projection. we therefore conclude that ni = 16 in this case. this
gauge bundle is non-perturbative from the heterotic viewpoint. on the orientifold side the
corresponding chan-paton matrix is given by [1,2]:

z2 :

g = diag(ii8, ii8) .

(3)

as to the z4 and z6 cases, the corresponding models are on the same moduli as the z2
model. indeed, in all three of these cases the gauge group can be higgsed completely. in
fact, in the z4 and z6 cases this can already be done just with the matter arising in the
sectors which are perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint [17]. then the gravitational
anomaly cancellation condition implies that after higgsing the number of hypermultiplets
in the open string sector is the same in all three models (the closed string spectra of these
models are identical), hence they are on the same moduli. this implies that in the z4 and
z6 cases we also have n5 = 8 and ni = 16. in the orientifold language the corresponding
chan-paton matrices are given by [3]:

z4 :
z6 :

g = diag(i4, i4,  1i4,  1i4) ,
g = diag(ii2, ii2, i1i2, i1i2, ii4, ii4) ,

(4)
(5)

where   exp(i/4).

thus, the gauge bundles that are perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint have
(n5, ni) = (0, 24) and (n5, ni) = (8, 16). it is instructive to understand these gauge bundles
a bit better. in particular, here we would like to discuss them in the heterotic and f-theory
pictures. on the heterotic side there are three topologically distinct gauge bundles with
(n5, ni) = (0, 24). these are characterized by the generalized second stiefel-whitney class

ew2 (which is an element of h 2(k3, z), or, more precisely, of h 2(k3, z2) as ew2 is dened
modulo a shift by twice a lattice vector of h 2(k3, z)) [18,19]. the three distinct gauge
bundles correspond to: (1) ew2 = 0; (2) ew2  ew2 = 0 (mod 4); (3) ew2  ew2 = 2 (mod 4). in the

rst case we have vector structure, while (2) and (3) are the cases without vector structure.
to understand the above three cases better, it is useful to think about the corresponding
gauge bundles in terms of the z2 orbifold action on the spin(32)/z2 degrees of freedom in
the heterotic context. this action can be viewed in terms of a z2 valued shift v of the
spin(32)/z2 lattice. let us use the cartan basis of so(32) to write v . if 2v belongs to

1throughout this paper (unless specied otherwise) we work with 16  16 (rather than 32  32)
chan-paton matrices for we choose not to count the orientifold images of the corresponding d-
branes.

the so(32) lattice, then we have vector structure, and ew2 = 0. two inequivalent gauge
bundles of this type which are perturbative from the heterotic viewpoint are given by v =
((1/2)2 014) and v = ((1/2)6 010) (here we have chosen the surviving spinor of spin(32)/z2
to be given by ((1/2)16) modulo so(32) shifts).
in particular, they satisfy the modular
invariance constraints such as the level matching condition. (thus, the gauge bundle given
by v = ((1/2)2 014) corresponds to the standard embedding for the z2 orbifold.) these
gauge bundles are non-perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint.

however, we can have v such that 2v does not belong to the so(32) lattice, albeit it
does belong to the spin(32)/z2 lattice. two inequivalent gauge bundles of this type are

given by v = ((1/4)16) and v = ((1/4)15(3/4)). note that for such gauge bundles ew2 6= 0,
and ew2  ew2 = (2v )2, where by (2v )2 we mean the length squared of the 16-vector 2v . the

gauge bundle given by v = ((1/4)16) is non-perturbative from the heterotic viewpoint - it
does not satisfy the level matching condition. in fact, this is precisely the gauge bundle in
the type iib orientifold of t 4/z2 [1,2]. as we have already mentioned, this gauge bundle
corresponds to embedding 16 instantons accompanied by 8 5-branes to cancel the anomalies.
on the other hand, the gauge bundle v = ((1/4)15(3/4)) is perturbative from the heterotic
viewpoint - it satises the level matching requirement, and corresponds to embedding all 24
instantons. it is, however, non-perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint.

finally, let us discuss the f-theory duals of the above cases.

in [20] it was shown

that in the ew2 = 0 case the dual f-theory compactication is on the calabi-yau three-
fold given by the t 2 bration over the base f4. (here fn are hirzebruch surfaces.)
in
the case of the z3 orbifold this can be seen in two ways. first, we can higgs the u(8) 
so(16) gauge group at the orbifold point (see table i) down to so(8)  so(8) with 10
adjoint hypermultiplets in the rst so(8) and no matter in the second so(8). this is
precisely the spectrum of the f-theory dual on the calabi-yau three-fold with the base f4
(at the voisin-borcea orbifold point - see section iv). on the other hand, we can explicitly
construct the so(8)  so(8) point in the string language. let k3 be (t 2  t 2)/z3, where
z3 simultaneously rotates the two t 2s by 2/3. then consider the following choice of
the gauge bundle. first, let us turn on a z2 valued wilson line on the a-cycle of, say,
the rst t 2 such that it breaks so(32) down to so(16)  so(16). next, let us turn
on the second z2 valued wilson line on the b-cycle of the same t 2 such that it further
breaks so(16)  so(16) down to so(8)4. it is not dicult to see that this theory has z3
symmetry under which, say, the rst three so(8)s are cyclically permuted. in fact, since the
t 2s are hexagonal, under the z3 rotation the a-cycles maps to the b-cycle, and so the rst
wilson line maps to the second wilson line. the choice of the gauge bundle corresponding
to the z3 orbifold then precisely consists of the twist permuting the rst three so(8)s,
while leaving the last so(8) untouched. the resulting model has so(8)3  so(8)1 gauge
group, where the subscript indicates the current algebra level via which the corresponding
subgroup is realized. the untwisted sector contains the gravity supermultiplet, one tensor
supermultiplet, 2 neutral hypermultiplets, and one hypermultiplet in the adjoint of so(8)3.
the twisted sector contains 18 neutral hypermultiplets (corresponding to the blow-up modes
of the orbifold), and 9 hypermultiplets in the adjoint of so(8)3. this spectrum precisely
matches that of the f-theory dual corresponding to the base f4.

as to the cases with ew2  ew2 = 0 (mod 4) and ew2  ew2 = 2 (mod 4), the corresponding
dual f-theory compactications are on calabi-yau three-folds given by t 2 brations over

6

f0 respectively f1 [20]. here we note that these cases also correspond to voisin-borcea
orbifolds, but at the latter points in the respective moduli spaces the corresponding bases
are singular leading to additional matter [21] precisely such that the resulting massless
spectra match those of the heterotic/type i duals. also, as was pointed out in [11], in

the ew2  ew2 = 0 (mod 4) case one can also view the dual f-theory compactication as on
a singular calabi-yau three-fold (with hodge numbers (h1,1, h2,1) = (3, 51)) given by the
non-geometric z2  z2 orbifold of t 2  t 2  t 2 with discrete torsion [22]. this f-theory
compactication is in turn on the same moduli as that on a smooth calabi-yau three-fold
(with hodge numbers (h1,1, h2,1) = (3, 243)) given by the t 2 bration over the base p1  p1
(that is, the smooth f0 surface) [11].

to summarize, the gauge bundles which are perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint

are those with (n5, ni) = (0, 24), ew2 = 0 (this is the case for the gauge bundle in the z3 case
(2)), and (n5, ni) = (8, 16), ew2  ew2 = 0 (mod 4) (this is the case for the gauge bundles in

the z2 (3), z4 (4), and z6 (5) cases).

iii. non-perturbative k3 orientifolds

in the previous section we have discussed the gauge bundles in k3 compactications of
type i which are perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint. in this section we would like
to discuss the explicit type i vacua arising upon compactications on k3 with these gauge
bundles. these compactications can be viewed as the  orientifolds of type iib on (the
corresponding orbifold limits of) k3. thus, the z2 case with the gauge bundle given by
(3) (the action of the orbifold group on both d9- and d5-branes is the same) was discussed
in [1,2]. this model is completely perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint. thus, the
-twisted sector of the orientifold can be viewed as the usual (untwisted) 99 and 55
open string sectors. the g-twisted sector (with g2 = 1 in this case) can be viewed
as the usual (untwisted) 59 open string sector. these sectors are perturbative from the
orientifold point of view. the massless open spectrum of this model is given in table i.

in the z3 case we do have non-perturbative sectors, however. thus, the -twisted
sector of the orientifold corresponds to the untwisted 99 open string sector (there are no d5-
branes in this case). the g- and g2-twisted sectors (with g3 = 1 in this case) correspond
to the z3 twisted 99 open string sector. this model has a perturbative heterotic dual which
enables one to obtain its massless spectrum [14], and the latter is given2 in table i.

2for the sake of simplicity, throughout this paper we omit the u (1) charges. in the untwisted
open string sectors they are straightforward to determine from the standard chan-paton charge
assignments. in the twisted open string sectors, however, these u (1) charges are generically frac-
tional (in the normalization where the fundamental of su (n )  u (n ) in the untwisted open
string sectors has the u (1) charge +1). in certain cases one can determine these charges using
type i-heterotic duality (as on the heterotic side these charges can be computed perturbatively in
the corresponding twisted sectors). in other cases determining the twisted sector u (1) charges can
be more involved. also, some of the twisted closed string states can transform non-trivially under
gauge transformations of some of the u (1)s. the corresponding u (1) charges (in the appropriate

7

in the z6 case we do not have a perturbative heterotic dual as the type i model contains
d5-branes. nonetheless, it is still possible to determine the spectrum of the model. thus,
the z3 twisted 99 open string sector is the same as in the z3 model with the projection
onto the z2 invariant states (note that z6  z3  z2). in particular, the 9 xed points in
the original z3 twisted sector are combined into 5 linear combinations invariant under z2
plus 4 linear combinations which pick up a minus sign under the z2 action. taking this
into account, it is straightforward to determine the z2 invariant states in the z3 twisted 99
open string sector (see [14] for details). the z3 twisted 55 open string sector is a bit more
subtle - here we assume that all d5-branes are sitting on top of each other at the orientifold
5-plane located at the origin of k3 (z1 = z2 = 0). this implies that the d5-branes only
feel the singularity in k3 located at the origin. that is, the other 8 of the original 9 xed
points in the z3 twisted sector play no role in this discussion as the twisted 55 states arise
due to the local geometry near the origin. this results in the fact that the corresponding
multiplicity in the z3 twisted 55 open string sectors is 1. finally, the g- and g5-twisted
sectors (with g6 = 1 in this case) correspond to the z3 twisted 59 open string sector. in
this case local geometry once again determines the multiplicity of states to be 1 (and also
xes their quantum numbers) [14]. the massless spectrum of the z6 model is summarized
in table i. note that the twisted 99 and 55 open string sectors no longer exhibit the naive
t-duality. this is due to the fact that these sectors do not arise via a straightforward
orbifold reduction of the corresponding (so(32)) gauge theory (with n = 2 supersymmetry
in six dimensions). more concretely, the t-duality transformation involves z2 reection of
the complex coordinates z1, z2. the z3 singularities, however, are not invariant under this
z2 action, hence the lack of t-duality symmetry.

finally, let us consider the z4 case which was not discussed in [14]. the main diculty
in this case is that (unlike in the z3 and z6 cases) this model has no perturbative heterotic
dual, nor do we have any sectors of the theory which can be understood by performing a
perturbative computation on the heterotic side. fortunately, however, anomaly cancellation
requirements (which are quite constraining in six dimensions) along with the relevant geo-
metric picture allow us to determine the massless spectrum in this case as well. thus, the
gravitational anomaly cancellation condition reads:

nh  nv = 273  29nt ,

(6)

where nh , nv , nt are the numbers of hypermultiplets, vector multiplets and tensor multi-
plets, respectively. in this case we have nt = 1 tensor multiplets and nc
h = 20 hypermulti-
plets from the closed string sector. all the vector multiplets arise in the open string sector.
in particular, nv = 256 as the gauge group is [u(8)u(8)]99 [u(8)u(8)]55. the anomaly
cancellation condition (6) then implies that the total number of open string hypermultiplets
must be: no
h = 480. the perturbative sectors, namely, the untwisted 99 plus
55 as well as 59 sectors give rise to 368 hypermultiplets in this model (see table i). thus,
112 = 4  28 hypermultiplets must come from the twisted open string sectors. these are
the z4 twisted 99 and 55 open string sectors corresponding to the g- and g3-twisted
sectors (with g4 = 1 in this case). note that there is no twisted 59 sector in this model.

h = nh  nc

basis) can therefore be non-zero (and sometimes even fractional).

8

from the anomaly cancellation we get a hint that the twisted 99 and 55 open string
sector hypermultiplets must transform in the antisymmetric representation 28 of the su(8)
subgroups. in fact, since the two su(8)s within, say, the 55 open string sector are on the
equal footing, we conclude that the only way we can cancel anomalies is by assuming that in
the twisted 55 sector we have one copy of twisted hypermultiplets in (28, 1)55 and (1, 28)55,
and similarly for the twisted 99 sector. in the 55 sector this is actually what one expects
from the geometric picture: just as in the z6 case here we have all d5-branes on top of each
other at the orientifold 5-plane located at the origin of k3, so we expect only one copy of
non-perturbative twisted hypermultiplets arising due to the local geometry at the vicinity
of the origin (the latter being the relevant singularity in k3). however, for the 99 sector
the conclusion that we have only one copy of twisted hypermultiplets might appear a bit
puzzling - the d9-branes wrap the entire k3, and naively one expects that they should feel
all 4 z4 xed points.

let us try to understand this point a bit better. an important observation here is
that the naive t-duality is expected to be a symmetry of this background - indeed, the
z2 reection of the complex coordinates z1, z2 involved in the t-duality transformation
leaves the corresponding z4 singularities invariant. thus, the z4 twisted 55 and 99 open
string sectors should have t-duality symmetry. then we must explain how come in the
99 sector we do not get 4 copies of the corresponding matter representations but only one.
the point here is that we expect massless non-perturbative states to arise only for true
geometric singularities. however, if there is a non-zero twisted b-eld turned on inside
of the p1 associated with a given blow-up mode (that is, with a given xed point), then
non-perturbative states do not arise [24]. since we are dealing with the z4 twisted sectors,
the corresponding twisted b-eld can only take values 0, 1/4, 1/2 (here we normalize the
b-eld so that it is dened modulo a unit shift). the b-led must be zero at the origin.
at the other three xed points, however, it must be non-zero. note that it cannot be 1/4
as this would not be invariant under the orientifold action  (recall that the b-eld is odd
under the action of ). however, the b-eld at these three xed points can take a half-
integer value which (taking into account that it is only dened modulo an integer shift) is
invariant under the action of . thus, to obtain a consistent z4 orbifold background (with
all d5-branes located at the origin of k3), we must turn on half-integer twisted b-eld at the
other three xed points. then the massless spectrum of the z4 model, which is summarized
in table i, is free of anomalies. here we should note that in the z3 and z6 models the
twisted b-eld (in the z3 twisted sectors) must be zero as non-zero values such as 1/3
would not be invariant under the action of . this is why in these models all singularities
(that is, xed points) are relevant in the twisted 99 sector.

here we would like to point out that all three z2, z4, z6 models are on the same moduli.
as we have already mentioned, at generic points with completely broken gauge symmetry
these models correspond to f-theory compactications on the calabi-yau three-fold (with
the hodge numbers (h1,1, h2,1) = (3, 243)) given by the t 2 bration over the base p1  p1.

iv. type i on voisin-borcea orbifolds

in this section we consider four dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric type i compact-
ications on calabi-yau three-folds known as voisin-borcea orbifolds [25,26]. to aid the

9

presentation, in the next subsection we review various basic facts about voisin-borcea orb-
ifolds following [27,21,11]. to clarify some points discussed in the previous sections, we
also briey discuss f-theory compactications on these spaces. having reviewed the rele-
vant background material, we then discuss type i compactications on these calabi-yau
three-folds as well as their dual f-theory compactications on the corresponding calabi-yau
four-folds known as borcea four-folds.

a. voisin-borcea orbifolds

let w2 be a k3 surface (which is not necessarily an orbifold of t 4) which admits an
involution j such that it reverses the sign of the holomorphic two-form dz1  dz2 on w2.
consider the following quotient:

y3 = (t 2  w2)/y ,

(7)

where y = {1, s}  z2, and s acts as sz0 = z0 on t 2 (z0 being a complex coordinate on
t 2), and as j on w2. this quotient is a calabi-yau three-fold with su(3) holonomy which
is elliptically bered over the base b2 = w2/b, where b = {1, j}  z2.

nikulin gave a classication [28] of possible involutions of k3 surfaces in terms of three
invariants (r, a, ) (for a physicists discussion, see, e.g., [27,21]). the result of this clas-
sication is plotted in fig.2 (which has been borrowed from [11]) according to the values
of r and a. the open and closed circles correspond to the cases with  = 0 and  = 1,
respectively. (the cases denoted by  are outside of nikulins classication, and we will
discuss them shortly.) in the case (r, a, ) = (10, 10, 0) the base b2 is an enriques surface,
and the corresponding y3 has hodge numbers (h1,1, h2,1) = (11, 11). in all the other cases
the hodge numbers are given by:

h1,1 = 5 + 3r  2a ,
h2,1 = 65  3r  2a .

(8)
(9)

for (r, a, ) = (10, 10, 0) the z2 twist s is freely acting (that is, it has no xed points).
for (r, a, ) = (10, 8, 0) the xed point set of s consists of two curves of genus 1. the base
b2 in this case is p2 blown up at 9 points. in all the other cases the xed point set of s
consists of one curve of genus g plus k rational curves, where

g =

k =

1
2
1
2

(22  r  a) ,

(r  a) .

(10)

(11)

it is sometimes useful to separate the above hodge numbers into the contribution
0 , h2,1
 ) of the z2 twisted (that is,

0 ) of the untwisted sector and the contribution (h1,1

(h1,1
s-twisted) sector. these are given by

 , h2,1

h1,1
0 = r + 1 ,
h2,1
0 = 21  r ,

10

(12)
(13)

and

respectively.

h1,1
 = 4(k + 1) ,
h2,1
 = 4g ,

(14)
(15)

note that except for the cases with a = 22  r, r = 11, . . . , 20, the mirror pair of y3 is

given by the voisin-borcea orbifold ey3 with er = 20  r, ea = a. under the mirror transform
we have: eg = f , ef = g, where f = k + 1.
in the cases a = 22  r, r = 11, . . . , 20, the mirror would have to have er = 20  r and
ea = a = er + 2, where er = 0, . . . , 9. we have depicted these cases in fig.2 using the 

symbol. in particular, we have plotted cases with a = r + 2, r = 0, . . . , 10. the hodge
numbers for these cases are still given by (8) and (9) (which follows from their denition
as mirror pairs of the cases with a = 22  r, r = 11, . . . , 20). (this is true for a = r + 2,
r = 0, . . . , 9. extrapolation to r = 10 is motivated by the fact that in this case we get
(h1,1, h2,1) = (11, 11) which is the same as for (r, a, ) = (10, 10, 0).) in [11] it was argued
that these voisin-borcea orbifolds also exist, albeit they are singular. in fact, some of them
can be constructed explicitly (see [11] for details).

as we already mentioned, here we would like to briey review f-theory compactica-
tions on voisin-borcea orbifolds (which correspond to n = 1 supersymmetric vacua in six
dimensions). thus, consider f-theory on y3 with3 (r, a, ) 6= (10, 10, 0) or (10, 8, 0). this
gives rise to the following massless spectrum in six dimensions. the number of tensor mul-
tiplets is t = r  1. the number of neutral hypermultiplets is h = 22  r. the gauge
group is so(8)  so(8)k. there are g adjoint hypermultiplets of the rst so(8). there
are no hypermultiplets charged under the other k so(8)s. under mirror symmetry g and
f = k + 1 are interchanged. thus, the vector multiplets in the adjoint of so(8)k are traded
for g  1 hypermultiplets in the adjoint of the rst so(8). that is, gauge symmetry turns
into global symmetry and vice-versa. this can be pushed further to understand f-theory
compactications on calabi-yau three-folds with a = r + 2, r = 1, . . . , 10, which give the
following spectra4. the number of tensor multiplets is t = r  1. there are h = 22  r
neutral hypermultiplets. in addition there are g = 10  r hypermultiplets transforming as
adjoints under a global so(8) symmetry. there are no gauge bosons, however. it is not

3in the case (r, a, ) = (10, 10, 0) we have t = 9 tensor multiplets, h = 12 hypermultiplets,
and no gauge vector multiplets. in the case (r, a, ) = (10, 8, 0) we have t = 9 tensor multiplets,
h = 12 neutral hypermultiplets, gauge vector multiplets corresponding to so(8)  so(8), one
hypermultiplet in the adjoint of the rst so(8), and one hypermultiplet in the adjoint of the
second so(8).

4here we must exclude the case with r = 0, a = 2 for the f-theory prediction would be t = 1
tensor multiplets. this calabi-yau three-fold does exist [11], but it is singular and f-theory
compactication on this space does not appear to have a local lagrangian description. however,
an extremal transition [21] between this calabi-yau three-fold and another voisin-borcea orbifold
could lead to a phase transition into a well dened vacuum.

11

dicult to verify that this massless spectrum is free of gravitational anomalies in six dimen-
sions. in fact, f-theory compactications on these singular spaces are equivalent to f-theory
compactications on smooth calabi-yau three-folds according to the following relation [11]:

f-theory on y3 with (h1,1, h2,1) = (r + 1, 61  5r) is equivalent to
f-theory on by3 with (h1,1, h2,1) = (r + 1, 301  29r) (r = 1, . . . , 9) .

(16)
thus, for instance, for r = 2 we get (h1,1, h2,1) = (3, 243), which is the elliptic calabi-yau
given by the t 2 bration over the base p1  p1. we have already encountered this calabi-
yau three-fold in the previous sections. note that f-theory compactications on voisin-
borcea orbifolds with (r, a, ) = (2, 2, 0), (2, 2, 1) are on the same moduli as the background
corresponding to (h1,1, h2,1) = (3, 243). the reason is that the corresponding bases in the
former two cases (namely, the hirzebruch surfaces f0 and f1) are singular at the voisin-
borcea points [21]. after the appropriate blow-ups additional matter arises precisely such
that the moduli count matches that for the (h1,1, h2,1) = (3, 243) compactication.

b. type i on voisin-borcea orbifolds

in this subsection we consider some general aspects of type i compactications on voisin-
borcea orbifolds reviewed in the previous subsection. in discussing such a compactication,
we must specify the gauge bundle. we discussed perturbative (from the orientifold view-
point) gauge bundles for k3 compactications in section ii. our goal here will be to deter-
mine which gauge bundles are perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint for the voisin-
borcea compactications.
it turns out that one can answer this question using the map
between type iib orientifolds and f-theory. in fact, as we will see in a moment, the re-
quirement that the gauge bundle be perturbative greatly restricts the possible choices of the
compactication space itself.

thus, consider type i compactication on the voisin-borcea orbifold y3 labeled by
(r, a, ) 6= (10, 10, 0). we can view this as the  orientifold of type iib on y3. this theory
contains 32 d9-branes as well as d5-branes. thus, there are d5-branes lling r3,1  c,
where r3,1 is the non-compact four dimensional minkowski space-time, whereas c is the
set of points (of real dimension 2) in b2 xed under the action of the z2 twist s (see the
previous subsection for notations). there may be other 5-branes depending upon the choice
of the space y3. thus, if the k3 surface w2 (recall that the base of the elliptic bration
2 can be either t 4 or
is b2 = w2/j) can be written as the quotient w2 = w 
another k3 surface), where the generator r of z2 reects both of the complex coordinates
z1, z2 on w 
2, then we have other 5-branes in the theory. first, we have d5-branes lling
r3,1  c , where c  is the set of points (of real dimension 2) in b2 xed under the action
of the twist sr. also, there are 5-branes lling r3,1  t 2 (here t 2 is the bre t 2). more
precisely, as we will see in a moment, this is the case for perturbative gauge bundles (while
for other choices of the gauge bundle these 5-branes may be absent).

2/z2 (here w 

to understand which gauge bundles are perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint in
the case of voisin-borcea compactications, it is convenient to t-dualize the corresponding

type i background in the direction of the bre t 2. this way we arrive at the  ej(1)fl
orientifold of type iib on y3 (which contains various 7-branes plus, in certain cases, 3-
branes). here ej reects the complex coordinate z0 on the bre t 2 (while acting trivially

12

on the base b2), and fl is the left-moving (space-time) fermion number. this orientifold
can now be mapped to the f-theory compactication on an elliptically bered calabi-yau
four-fold via the map of [29] which we review next.

consider an  ej (1)fl orientifold of type iib on y3, where ej reverses the sign of the
holomorphic 3-form dz1  dz2  dz3 on y3, and the set of points xed under ej in y3 has real
dimension 4. then following [29] we can map this orientifold to (a limit of) f-theory on a
calabi-yau four-fold x4 dened as

x4 = ( et 2  y3)/x ,

(17)

where x = {1, es}  z2, and es acts as esez0 = ez0 on et 2 (ez0 is a complex coordinate on et 2),
and as ej on y3. to avoid confusion, here we use tilde to distinguish between the bre et 2 in
the elliptic bration over the base b3 = y3/b, where b  {1, ej}  z2, and the bre t 2 in
the elliptic bration over the base b2 = w2/y .
note that in the case where y3 is a voisin-borcea orbifold, the above four-fold x4 can be
viewed as a quotient (fw2  w2)/y . here fw2  (et 2  t 2)/x (recall that x = {1, es}  z2,
and es acts as esez0 = ez0 and esz0 = z0 on the complex coordinates parametrizing et 2
and t 2, respectively). thus, fw2 is (the z2 orbifold limit of) a k3 surface. the action
of y = {1, s} on the two k3 surfaces fw2 and w2 is given by the corresponding nikulins
involutions labeled by the integers (er,ea, e) and (r, a, ) respectively. (in fact, it is not dicult
to show that in the present case er = 18 and ea = 4.) these calabi-yau four-folds (which have

su(4) holonomy) generically are singular spaces. the euler number  of such a four-fold is
given by [26]:

1
24

 = 12 +

1
4

(er  10)(r  10) .

taking into account that in the case at hand we have er = 18, we obtain

1
24

 = 12 + 2(r  10) = 2(r  4) .

(18)

(19)

now consider f-theory compactication on such a four-fold. to cancel space-time anomaly
we need to introduce /24 3-branes, which implies that this number must be non-negative
or else supersymmetry appears to be broken [30]. it then follows that

type i on voisin-borcea orbifolds can be tadpole free only for r  4.

(20)

this is a non-trivial constraint with interesting implications for type i model building. for
instance, if we take type i on a z2  z2 orbifold of t 2  t 2  t 2 with discrete torsion, the
hodge numbers are (h1,1, h2,1) = (3, 51) (note that this is the mirror calabi-yau of a usual
z2 z2 orbifold without discrete torsion whose hodge numbers are (h1,1, h2,1) = (51, 3)), and
we have r = 2 and a = 4. thus, type i compactication on this space is always anomalous
(that is, there is no choice of the gauge bundle consistent with tadpole cancellation).

thus, let us consider type i compactications with r  4. in the dual f-theory picture
the number of 3-branes required for anomaly cancellation is 2(r  4).
if this number is
non-zero, we have a choice of where to place these 3-branes: (i) we can keep them in the
bulk; from the type i point of view these correspond to dynamical 5-branes (made of some

13

number of d5-branes); (ii) alternatively, we can dissolve them into the 7-branes; from
the type i viewpoint this corresponds to embedding a certain spin(32)/z2 gauge bundle.
the corresponding instantons are no longer point-like (at generic points). thus, we see
that we need to specify additional data, which is the choice of the gauge bundle. what we
are interested in understanding here is which choices are perturbative from the orientifold
viewpoint.

to answer this question recall that in k3 compactications the total number of instantons
must be 24. by these we actually mean the number ni of instantons embedded in the gauge
bundle plus the number n5 of 5-branes transverse to k3. in the case of the voisin-borcea
compactications this number 24 is reduced to 12 - the corresponding pairing takes place
due to the additional z2 projection by the orbifold group y. thus, /24 must be at least
12. this implies that the statement (20) can be made even stronger:

type i on voisin-borcea orbifolds can be tadpole free only for r  10.

(21)

in fact, since we have a z2 twist generated by s, we must include 32 d5-branes (lling
r3,1  c - see above). these correspond to 8 dynamical 5-branes: here two pairings take
place - one due to the  orientifold projection, and the other one due to the z2 orbifold
projection. note that here we are making an assumption that the corresponding background
is perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint - it is a priori not obvious at all that in other
cases we must include d5-branes. in fact, here we can give an example where this is not
the case. thus, consider spin(32)/z2 heterotic on t 4/z2 with the standard embedding of
the gauge bundle (which we discussed in section ii). this theory is perturbative from the
heterotic viewpoint, hence no 5-branes are present. that is, no d5-branes would be present
on the dual type i side either. this compactication, however, is non-perturbative from the
orientifold viewpoint.

thus, we must have at least 20 3-branes (12 from k3, and 8 from the d5-branes lling
r3,1c). this implies that, for the gauge bundle to be perturbative, we must have r  14. in
fact we will now show that there are only two choices of r for which we can have perturbative
gauge bundle: r = 14 and r = 18. first, suppose r > 14. then we must have additional
5-branes whose number is 2(r  14). however, the only other way we can obtain 5-branes
perturbatively in the orientifold language is to have 8 dynamical 5-branes (arising from 32
d5-branes) lling r3,1  c  (these are perpendicular to those lling r3,1  c). this then
implies that we must have r = 18. on the other hand, if r = 14 we must make sure that there
are no 5-branes lling r3,1  c . this implies that in this case the k3 surface w2 cannot be
written as the quotient w /z2. it then follows that there are no 5-branes transverse to k3
(that is, w2) either (that is, n5 = 0 and ni = 24 in the corresponding k3 compactication).
the above discussion shows that the gauge bundle can be perturbative if and only if
r = 14 or r = 18. let us apply these constraints to the cases where the k3 surface w2 is
a toroidal orbifold, that is, w2 = t 4/zn with n = 2, 3, 4, 6. in the n = 2 case (without
discrete torsion between s and the generator g of the k3 orbifold group) the hodge numbers
of the corresponding voisin-borcea orbifold are (h1,1, h2,1) = (51, 3), and r = 18, a = 4. we
then arrive at a consistent type i compactication on the z2  z2 orbifold discussed in
[5]. in the n = 3 case the hodge numbers are (h1,1, h2,1) = (35, 11), and we arrive at the
non-perturbative orientifold corresponding to type on z
6 orbifold recently constructed in
[14]. for later convenience we give the massless spectrum of this model in table ii.

14

next, consider the n = 4 case. suppose there is no discrete torsion between s and
g2 (where g is the generator of the k3 orbifold group). then the hodge numbers are
(h1,1, h2,1) = (61, 1), and, therefore, r = 20 and a = 2. on the other hand, if we include
discrete torsion between s and g2, we obtain (h1,1, h2,1) = (3, 51) just as in the z2  z2
case with discrete torsion. thus, in type on the z2  z4 orbifold we cannot cancel tadpoles
if we choose the perturbative gauge bundle. (in fact, in the case with discrete torsion it
is impossible to cancel tadpoles for any choice of the gauge bundle.
in the case without
discrete torsion tadpole cancellation might be possible at the expense of choosing a gauge
bundle which is non-perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint.) this explains why the
naive perturbative tadpole cancellation conditions were found in [9] to have no solution.
here the map to f-theory provides a simple geometric interpretation of this fact.

the above conclusion about perturbative inconsistency of type i on z2  z4 can be
used to understand other similar models. note that the sectors of the orientifold labeled
by , s, gk, k = 1, 2, 3, and sg2 are perturbatively well dened (as the corresponding
k3 orientifolds are well dened). this implies that the troublesome sectors are the sg
and sg3 sectors. this is precisely the conclusion that was reached in [11]. note that sg
is the generator of an orbifold group z4, which, to avoid confusion, we will refer to as z
4.
in particular, t 6/z
4 is a calabi-yau three-fold with su(3) holonomy. thus, we conclude
that type i on the z
4 orbifold is not consistent for perturbative gauge bundles. in fact,
we can further deduce that perturbative gauge bundles would lead to inconsistencies in the
z4  z4, z8 and z
12 orbifold models as well since all of these orbifold groups contain z
4
as a subgroup. this is in accord with the discussion in [11], where it was also argued why
in the z
8 model choosing the perturbative gauge bundle leads to similar inconsistencies as
well. thus, the discussion in [11] explains the results of [10] (where it was shown that the
naive perturbative tadpole cancellation conditions in the z
12 cases have no
solution) using the geometric picture via the map to f-theory. here the z2  z4 example
serves as an illustration of the discussion in [11].

4, z8, z

8 and z

finally, let us discuss the case n = 6 (without discrete torsion between s and g3,
where g is the generator of the k3 orbifold group). the hodge numbers in this case are
(h1,1, h2,1) = (51, 3) just as in the z2  z2 case without discrete torsion. this implies that
r = 18 and a = 4. this compactication, therefore, should be consistent for the appropriate
perturbative gauge bundle. we will explicitly construct this model (via the corresponding
non-perturbative orientifold) in the next subsection.

c. the z2  z6 model

in this subsection we are going to give the massless spectrum of the non-perturbative
orientifold based on the z2 z6 orbifold compactication of type i theory. this background
has n = 1 supersymmetry in four dimensions. here we should emphasize that the choice
of the gauge bundle in the model we discuss in this subsection is perturbative from the
orientifold viewpoint. the non-perturbative sectors arise due to singularities in the calabi-
yau itself as discussed in introduction. that is, non-perturbative states in this theory arise
along the lines of our discussion in section iii for k3 compactications of type i.

thus, consider type i on the voisin-borcea orbifold y3 = (t 2  t 2  t 2)/(z2  z6),
where the generators r3 and g of z2 respectively z6 have the following action on the complex

15

coordinates z1, z2, z3 parametrizing the three two-tori:

rizj = (1)ij zj , i, j = 1, 2, 3 ,
z1 = z1 ,

z2 = z2 ,

z3 = 1z3 ,

(22)
(23)

where r1  g3, r2  r1r3,   g2, and   exp(2i/3). the calabi-yau three-fold y3
(which has su(3) holonomy) has the hodge numbers (h1,1, h2,1) = (51, 3), so that there are
54 chiral supermultiplets in the closed string sector.

in the open string sector we have 32 d9-branes, and also three sets of d5-branes with
32 d5-branes in each set. thus, the world-volumes of the d5i-branes are four non-compact
space-time dimensions plus the two-torus parametrized by the complex coordinate zi. for
the sake of deniteness, in the following we will concentrate on the brane conguration
where all d5i-branes are placed on top of each other at the orientifold 5i-plane located at
the origin in the transverse dimensions (that is, zj = 0, j 6= i).

up to equivalent representations the chan-paton matrices are given by:

,9 = diag(w  i2, i8) ,
ri,9 = ii  i8 .

(24)
(25)

here w  diag(, , 1, 1), and i are the usual 2  2 pauli matrices. (the action on
the d5i-branes is similar.) the perturbative (from the orientifold viewpoint) massless open
string spectrum of this model can be obtained using the standard orientifold techniques,
and is given5 in table iii. thus, the -twisted sector corresponds to the untwisted 99 plus
5i5i open string sectors, while ri twisted sector corresponds to the untwisted 95i plus 5j5k
(j 6= k 6= i) open string sectors.

the non-perturbative sectors of the orientifold are the following. the - and 2-
twisted sectors correspond to the twisted 99 plus 5i5i open string sectors, while the ri-
and ri2-twisted sectors correspond to the twisted 95i plus 5j5k (j 6= k 6= i) open string
sectors. the twisted 951 and 952,3 sectors are straightforward to work out starting from
the twisted 95 sector in the six dimensional z6 model in table i respectively the twisted 95
sector in the four dimensional z
6 model in table ii and projecting onto the corresponding
z2 invariant states. the twisted 5253 sector is the same as the twisted 951 sector (with the
obvious substitutions of the gauge quantum numbers). the twisted 5152,3 sectors are the
same as the twisted 953,2 sectors except that the multiplicity of the states in the latter is 1,
while it is 3 in the former. this is due to the fact that the the corresponding 5-branes only feel
the local geometry in the vicinity of the corresponding xed points at which they are placed.
(this is in complete parallel with the corresponding discussion for the six dimensional cases
in [14] and section iii.) as to the twisted 99, 5252 and 5353 sectors, they can be worked out
6 model in table ii and projecting
by starting from the twisted 99 and 95 sectors in the z
onto the corresponding z2 invariant states. the only subtlety here is in the relative sign

5here we note that the perturbative spectrum of this model was discussed in [9]. the perturbative
spectrum given in table iii, however, diers from that in [9]. this is, we believe, due to the fact
that the chirality of the perturbative open string states was not worked out carefully in [9].

16

in this projection which requires some care due to the fact that even though the orbifold
group (and, in particular, its z2  z2 subgroup) is abelian, the corresponding chan-paton
matrices do not commute (in fact, they generate the group isomorphic to z3  d4, where d4
is the non-abelian dihedral group which is the double cover of z2  z2 to which the latter
is lifted upon embedding ri  ri). the correct action can be read o from the nal result
displayed in table iii. finally, in the case of the twisted 5151 sector even more care is needed
due to the above subtleties. in fact, to obtain the correct spectrum we can start from the
twisted 55 sector in the z6 model in table i, make the substitution (4, 4)  [(6, 1)  (1, 6)],
and then perform the corresponding z2 projection. the latter can be read o as follows.
perform the same substitution in the twisted 99 sector in the z6 model in table i. then the
same z2 projection as in the case of the twisted 5151 sector would give the correct twisted
99 open string sector displayed in table iii.

the complete massless spectrum of the z2  z6 model including both perturbative and
non-perturbative (from the orientifold viewpoint) states is given in table iii. note that all
non-abelian gauge anomalies cancel in this model in a rather non-trivial fashion.

v. type i on generalized voisin-borcea orbifolds

in the previous section we considered type i compactications on voisin-borcea orb-
ifolds of the form (t 2  k3)/z2. here we are going to discuss type i compactications on
generalized voisin-borcea orbifolds of the form

y3 = (t 2  w2)/zn ,

(26)

where w2 is a k3 surface, and the generator  of zn acts as z0 = z0 on the bre t 2
(parametrized by the complex coordinate z0), and as 2 = 12 on w2 (parametrized
by the complex coordinates z1, z2). here   exp(2i/n), and 2  dz1  dz2 is the
holomorphic two-form on w2. note that the holomorphic three-form 3  dz0  dz1  dz2
on y3 is invariant under the action of , which implies that y3 is a calabi-yau three-fold
with su(3) holonomy (which is actually elliptically bered over the base w2/zn ) provided
that the action of the orbifold group zn is a symmetry of t 2  w2. the latter requirement
implies that n is restricted to the values n = 2, 3, 4, 6 so that the action of zn on t 2 is
crystallographic. note that in the n = 2 case we have voisin-borcea orbifolds discussed in
the previous section. in this section we will be interested in the cases n = 3, 4, 6.

let us start with the n = 4 case. suppose w2 is an orbifold k3. then the three-fold y3
can be either the z4  z2 or z4  z4 orbifold of t 2  t 4. we have already discussed these
cases in the previous section where we saw that for perturbative gauge bundles tadpoles
cannot be canceled in these models.

next, let us consider the n = 6 case with w2 an orbifold k3. then y3 can be the
6  z2 orbifold of t 2  t 4. the rst case was explicitly
z6  z2, z6  z3, z6  z6 or z
constructed in the previous section. we will discuss the last case, which was explicitly
constructed in [13], in a moment. the other two cases are straightforward to work out: the
perturbative part of the spectrum is obtained using the standard orientifold techniques [9],
whereas the non-perturbative twisted open string sector states can be easily worked out by
starting with the corresponding twisted states in the z6 model in table i, the z
6 model in

17

table ii, and the z2  z6 model in table iii, and performing the appropriate (z2 and/or
z3) orbifold projections. here the following remark is in order. note that in the z6  z3 and
z6  z6 models a priori there are two types of twisted open string sectors. first, we have
open string sectors corresponding to the orientifold group elements labeled by , where
 is an orbifold group element such that for some choice of k  2z the set of points (in
t 2  w2) xed under k is of real dimension 2. these are precisely the twisted open string
sectors which can be deduced via the appropriate orbifold projections of the parent models
mentioned above. this is due to the fact that such twisted open string sectors are either
projections of those in the corresponding t 2  k3 compactications, or of twisted 59 open
string sectors which can be read o by appropriately projecting that in the z
6 model in
table ii. the second type of twisted open string sectors correspond to the orientifold group
elements labeled by  such that for some choice of k  2z the set of points xed under
k is zero dimensional. such twisted open string sectors were argued in [11] to give rise to
states that become heavy and decouple upon appropriately blowing up the corresponding
singularities in the compactication space [7,8,11]. we will discuss this point in more detail
shortly. here, however, an important observation is that the second type of twisted open
string sectors do not give rise to massless states once we consider blown-up orbifolds.

for the sake of brevity here we will not give the spectra of the z6  z3 and z6  z6
models. let us mention, however, that the gauge groups in these two cases are [u(2)6 
u(4)]99  [u(2)6  u(4)]55 respectively [u(2)3  sp(4)]99  n3
i=1[u(2)3  sp(4)]5i5i. thus,
the z6  z6 model is non-chiral if we ignore the u(1) charges. the z6  z3 model is chiral
as in the perturbative open string sectors there are states transforming under 4 and 4 of
the su(4) subgroups. however, the twisted open string sector states are not charged under
the su(4) subgroups, so that these sectors are automatically free of non-abelian gauge
anomalies. these two models, therefore, are not as illuminating as, say, the z2  z6 model
in table iii.

let us point out that the z

6 z2 model was explicitly constructed in [13]. the discussion
6(
3  z2) case. let us therefore consider the generalized voisin-borcea orbifolds with n = 3

of twisted open string sectors in this model is completely analogous to that in the z
z
(and the z

6 case is a particular example of this type).
for n = 3 we have the following possibilities: z

6, z

3  z2  z

3  z4  z12, z3  z3,
and z3  z6. the last case we have already considered. the z3  z3 case was explicitly
constructed in [8]. just as in the z6  z3 and z6  z3 cases, here we also have twisted open
string sectors of two types. as was shown in [8], in this model twisted states of both types
decouple upon appropriately blowing up the orbifold singularities, so that the remaining
massless spectrum coincides with that obtained in the perturbative orientifold approach.
this turns out not to be the case in the z12 model which we will discuss in detail in a
moment. however, some of the sectors in the z12 model are similar to those in the z
6
model, which was explicitly constructed in [8], so let us discuss the latter in a bit more
detail.

thus, consider type i on the generalized voisin-borcea orbifold (t 2 t 2 t 2)/z

6, where
6 on the complex coordinates z1, z2, z3 parametrizing the

the action of the generator g of z
three two-tori is given by:

gz1 = z1 ,

gz2,3 = z2,3 ,

(27)

18

6 twisted sectors are a subset of singularities in the z

where   exp(2i/3).
in this case we have 32 d9-branes and 32 d5-branes, the latter
wrapping the rst t 2. the non-perturbative open string sectors correspond to the orientifold
group elements labeled by g plus g5 and g2 plus g4. note that the singularities in
the z
3 twisted sectors. this implies
3 model lead to the decoupling of non-perturbative open string
that if the blow-ups in the z
6 model as well. the fact that non-perturbative
sector states, the same should hold in the z
3 model was shown
twisted open string sector states indeed decouple in the blown-up z
in [7] using type-i heterotic duality. thus, in the corresponding z
6 model we expect all
non-perturbative states to decouple as well.

a. the z12 model: a non-perturbative anomaly

we are now ready to discuss the z12 model. the generator g of z12 has the following

action on the three complex coordinates in the compact directions:

gz1 = z1 ,

gz2 = iz2 ,

gz3 = iz3 .

(28)

note that z12  z
6. the corresponding calabi-yau four-fold has the hodge numbers
(h1,1, h2,1) = (29, 5), so that the closed string spectrum contains 34 chiral supermultiplets.
6 case are also (h1,1, h2,1) = (29, 5). that
here we note that the hodge numbers in the z
is, in both the z
6 and z12 models the compactication space is the same, but the gauge
bundles are dierent.

in the open string sector we have 32 d9-branes as well as 32 d5-branes (in the following
we will focus on the brane conguration where all d5-branes are sitting on top of each other
at the orientifold 5-plane located at z2 = z3 = 0). the perturbative open string sector of
this model can be obtained using the standard orientifold techniques (once the action of the
orbifold group on the chan-paton factors is specied - see below). the non-perturbative
sectors corresponding to the orientifold group elements labeled by g plus g11, g2 plus
g10, g4 plus g8, and g5 plus g7 do not give rise to massless states (after the appropriate
blow-ups) for the same reasons as in the z
6 case. however, the z4 twisted open string sectors
corresponding to the orientifold group elements labeled by g3 plus g9 do give rise to non-
perturbative massless states. these states can be obtained by starting from the z4 model
in table i and projecting onto the z
3 invariant states. there is, however, a subtlety in this
projection, so let us discuss the action of the orbifold group on the chan-paton factors in a
bit more detail.

the point here is that to have a perturbative (from the orientifold viewpoint) gauge
bundle, we must make sure that all the twisted tadpole cancellation conditions (derived in
the perturbative orientifold approach) cancel. in particular, the twisted tadpole cancellation
condition for the z12, z
6, z4 and z2 twisted chan-paton matrices (for both d9- and d5-
branes) read [8,10]:

tr(gk) = 0 ,

k = 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11 .

(29)

on the other hand, the z
tadpole cancellation conditions as in the z

3 twisted chan-paton matrices are xed by the corresponding
3 model of [6] (see the next subsection for details).

19

the only way to satisfy all of these twisted tadpole cancellation conditions is to consider
32  32 chan-paton matrices which (up to equivalent representations) are given by

g4 = diag(i12, 1i12, i8) ,
g3 = diag(u  i3, u  i3, u  i2) ,

(30)
(31)

where u  diag(, ,  1,  1), and   exp(i/4). note that the same would not be
possible if we considered 1616 matrices. that is, the tadpole cancellation conditions require
that both 16 d-branes and their orientifold images participate in canceling the tadpoles at
the same time, while separate cancellations of the corresponding tadpoles for the 16 d-branes
and their orientifold images cannot be achieved. this, in particular, implies that (since
the 16 d-branes and their orientifold images are mapped to each other by the orientifold
projection) the chan-paton matrix  interchanges the twisted chan-paton matrices with
their conjugates:  : gk  gk. such an action is perfectly well dened in the six
dimensional j  orientifolds of [3] as in those cases the orientifold projection j  maps the
g-twisted sector to its conjugate g1-twisted sector. however, as we have already pointed out
in introduction, in four dimensions the orientifold projection is  which maps the g-twisted
sector to itself (here we assume that the appropriate blow-ups have been performed). it is
then a priori far from being obvious whether it is consistent to have  : gk  gk while
 : gk  gk. in fact, we are going to argue that such an action leads to inconsistencies.
here we should point out that such an inconsistency cannot be seen perturbatively in the
orientifold picture if we just focus on the gauge (that is, the open string) sector of the theory.
indeed, the perturbative open string sector of this model by itself is perfectly sensible (see
below). however, if one couples open and closed strings, then one expects an inconsistency
to show up - thus, the twisted closed string sector states (which couple to the corresponding
d-branes) feel the orientifold projection in a way which is not compatible with the action of
the orientifold projection on the chan-paton factors. that is, the orientifold group actions
on the closed and open string degrees of freedom are not compatible. it is, however, dicult
to see this open-closed coupling inconsistency directly as the  projection in the closed string
sector makes sense only after the appropriate blow-ups have been performed, so we are no
longer at the orbifold point in the corresponding calabi-yau moduli space, which makes
world-sheet computations rather involved (and practically useless, at least for our purposes
here).

there are, however, other ways to see this inconsistency. first, we can try to under-
stand it using type i-heterotic duality. here we should emphasize that quantifying the
following statements in this context is dicult as the heterotic dual of the z12 model would
be non-perturbative - we have 5-branes in this case. nonetheless, the following somewhat
hand-waving argument might still be useful. thus, on the heterotic side the embedding of
the gauge bundle (that is, of the orbifold action on the gauge degrees of freedom) can be
understood in terms of the appropriate z12 valued spin(32)/z2 lattice shifts. (these shifts
are z12 valued w.r.t. the spin(32)/z2 lattice, but are z24 valued w.r.t. the so(32) lat-
tice.) the  projection on the heterotic side can be thought of as pairing 32 real majorana
fermions (in the real fermion representation of the spin(32)/z2 degrees of freedom) into 16
complex world-sheet fermions. the z12 valued spin(32)/z2 lattice shifts in this language
translate into u(1)16 phase rotations of the complex fermions. for these rotations to be
consistent, we must make sure that they can be written in the complex 16  16 basis. if

20

this cannot be achieved, that is, if we can only do this in the 32  32 bases, then the model
is inconsistent6. in particular, the scattering amplitudes would be inconsistent [31]. in the
following subsection we will relate this argument to the analogous statement in the dual
f-theory picture, where the above inconsistency can be seen in a geometric way. however,
for now let us take the above gauge bundle and discuss the corresponding massless spectrum
arising in the z12 model. as we will see in a moment, the non-perturbative spectrum turns
out to be anomalous.

once the twisted chan-paton matrices are xed as above, the perturbative (from the
orientifold viewpoint) states in the z12 model are straightforward to work out. the resulting
perturbative massless open string sector is given7 in table iv. note that the non-abelian
gauge anomalies cancel in the untwisted open string sector.

next, let us discuss the non-perturbative open string sectors, that is, the z4 twisted
open string sectors. these are straightforward to work out starting from the z4 twisted
open string sectors in the z4 model in table i and projecting onto the z
3 invariant states.
note that the resulting twisted 99 and 55 open string sectors are apparently t-dual for the
same reason as in the z4 model in table i - the z4 xed points are invariant under the z2
reections involved in the t-duality transformation (recall that the other twisted sectors
6 and z12 do not give rise to non-perturbative states once the appropriate
such as z
blow-ups are performed). in fact, it is important here that the z4 sector xed point located
at the origin contains no twisted b-eld, whereas the other three xed points have half-
integer valued b-eld stuck inside of the corresponding p1s (see section iii for details). in
particular, this conguration possesses the required z3 symmetry.

3, z

next, we list the resulting non-perturbative states arising in the z4 twisted open string

sectors (these states are n = 1 chiral supermultiplets - see table iv for notations):

(3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)99(t )/55(t ) ,
(1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1)99(t )/55(t ) ,
(1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1)99(t )/55(t ) ,
(3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1)99(t )/55(t ) ,
(1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1)99(t )/55(t ) ,
(1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2)99(t )/55(t ) ,

6on the type i side this would amount to an inconsistency arising in the world-sheet theory of
a probe d-string placed in this background. i would like to thank e. gimon for a discussion in a
related but somewhat dierent context.

7here we note that the perturbative open string spectrum of the z12 model was discussed in
[10]. the untwisted open string spectrum given in table iv, however, diers from that in [10]. in
particular, note that the spectrum should be invariant under permuting the two u (2) subgroups
(accompanied by an appropriate interchange/conjugation of the corresponding u (3) subgroups)
in, say, the 99 open string sector, which follows from the action of the orbifold group on the chan-
paton factors. this is the case for the spectrum in table iv, but not for the spectrum given in
[10].

21

(1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1)99(t )/55(t ) ,
(1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2)99(t )/55(t ) ,

where the rst four of these states come from the hypermultiplet transforming in (28, 1), and
the last four come from the hypermultiplet transforming in (1, 28) upon z
3 projecting the
[u(8)  u(8)]99/55 quantum numbers in the z4 model in table i. note that the above twisted
spectrum suers from su(3)4 non-abelian gauge anomalies. that is, non-perturbatively we
see an inconsistency in this model. in the next subsection we will give additional arguments
clarifying the origins of this non-perturbative anomaly using the map between type iib
orientifolds and f-theory.

b. map to f-theory

in the previous section we gave the map between type i on voisin-borcea orbifolds and
f-theory. in this subsection we would like to do the same in the case of generalized voisin-
borcea orbifolds with n = 3, 4, 6. there is a subtlety in this map (as was pointed out in
[11]) in the n = 3, 6 cases, and here we will give make this map precise.

naively, we can start from y3 = (t 2  w2)/zn , t-dualize along the bre t 2, and map
the resulting model to f-theory via [29] to arrive at the f-theory compactication on the
following calabi-yau four-fold:

x4 = ( et 2  t 2  w2)/(z2  zn ) ,

(32)

is no subtlety in the above map in these cases.

where the action of the generator es of z2 is given by esez0 = ez0, esz0 = z0, and it acts
trivially on w2; the action of the generator  of zn is given by ez0 = ez0, z0 = z0,
2 = 12. here ez0 and z0 parametrize et 2 respectively t 2,   exp(2i/n), and 2
is the holomorphic two-form on w2 (which is a k3 surface). note, however, that the zn
singularities in the y3 bre t 2 are invariant under es only in the n = 2, 4 cases. thus, there
in the n = 3, 6 cases, however, the zn
singularities are not invariant under es, so that we must be a bit more careful. in fact, the
issue in the n = 6 case is the same as in the n = 3 case, so we can focus on the latter.
moreover, instead of considering the generalized voisin-borcea orbifolds y3, we will discuss
3 orbifold. the discussion for the other cases
this point for a simpler example, namely, the z
is completely analogous. thus, let us start from type i on y3 = (t 2  t 2  t 2)/z
3, where
3 acts on the complex coordinates z1, z2, z3 parametrizing the three
the generator g of z
two-tori as gzi = zi (i = 1, 2, 3,   exp(2i/3)). the hodge numbers of this calabi-yau
three-fold are given by (h1,1, h2,1) = (36, 0).

in this type i compactication, which was studied in detail in [6,7,32], we have 32 d9-
branes and no d5-branes. the twisted tadpole cancellation conditions read tr(g) = 2 (in
the 16  16 basis). this implies that (up to equivalent representations) we have

g = diag(i6, 1i6, i4) ,

(33)

where   exp(2i/3). the gauge group of this model is u(12)so(8), and the (untwisted)
99 open string sector contains the following chiral supermultiplets: 3  (66, 1) plus 3 
(12, 8v).

22

here we would like to ask what is the t-dual (where we t-dualize along both directions
in the rst t 2) of this type i background. that is, we would like to understand the dual
type iib orientifold with d7-branes. in fact, to t-dualize we must rst turn on wilson lines
3 orbifolding) to so(8)4. indeed, the
which break the original so(32) gauge group (before z
corresponding t-dual of type i on t 2  t 2  t 2 is the  ej (1)fl orientifold of type iib
on t 2  t 2  t 2, where ejz1 = z1, and ej z2,3 = z2,3. note that t 2/ ej has four xed points

at which are located the corresponding orientifold 7-planes. we must place 8 d7-branes at
each of these orientifold 7-planes to properly cancel tadpoles (this statement is precise in the
perturbative orientifold context). thus, the gauge group is so(8)4. in fact, let us see what
are the locations of these xed points. in order for t 2s to have z
3 symmetry (by which we
are ultimately going to mod out), they must be hexagonal. let us focus on the rst t 2 whose
volume we will denote by v1. then the metric on t 2 is given by gab = qv1/3 eaeb, a, b = 1, 2,
where ea are the vectors spanning the su(3) lattice. that is, e2
2 = 2e1  e2 = 2. the
ej xed points are located at 0 = 0, a = ea/2, a = 1, 2, 3, where e3  (e1 + e2).
the t-dual type i conguration of the above type iib orientifold is given by the fol-
lowing. start from type i with 32 d9-branes on t 2  t 2  t 2. turn on two wilson lines -
one on the a-cycle and the other one on the b-cycle of the rst t 2 - such that they break the
so(32) gauge symmetry down to so(8)4. this is precisely the conguration we are looking
for. note that this setup is symmetric under z3 valued permutations of any three of the
four so(8) subgroups accompanied by 2/3 rotations of the rst t 2. under these rotations
the rst wilson line maps to the second wilson line (as the a-cycle maps to the b-cycle on
t 2). therefore, we can mod out by the z
3 symmetry. the corresponding gauge bundle is
given by the following chan-paton matrix:

1 = e2

g = diag(p3  i4, w) ,

(34)

where p3 is a 3  3 matix of cyclic permutations, and w  diag(i2, 1i2). note that we
still have tr(g) = 2, so that the twisted tadpole cancellation conditions are satised. the
resulting gauge group is so(8)  u(4), and the matter consists of chiral supermultiplets in
3  (28, 1) plus 3  (1, 6). the so(8) factor arises as the diagonal subgroup of the original
so(8)3 subgroup on which the permutation matrix p3 is acting. the u(4) factor is the
corresponding subgroup of the fourth so(8).

the above so(8)  u(4) model actually is on the same moduli as the original u(12) 
so(8) model [7]. the former point in the moduli space is t-dual of the corresponding
type iib orientifold with d7-branes, and the latter can now be readily mapped to f-theory.

the corresponding compactication space is given by the four-fold x4 = (et 2  t 2  t 2 
3), which has su(4) holonomy, and is an elliptic bration of et 2 over the base
t 2)/(z2  z
(t 2  t 2  t 2)/(z2  z

3).

we can generalize the above discussion to other examples of this type. in particular,
type i on y3 = (t 2w2)/zn (where w2 is either a k3 surface or t 4) with the appropriately
turned on wilson lines is dual to f-theory on the elliptic four-fold (32). the euler number
of a four-fold is expressed in terms of the corresponding hodge numbers via:

 = 4 + 2h1,1  4h2,1 + 2h3,1 + h2,2 .

(35)

however, for elliptic four-folds we have

23

h2,2 = 44 + 4h1,1  2h2,1 + 4h3,1 ,

(36)

so it suces to give the hodge numbers (h1,1,, h2,1, h3,1) to specify such a four-fold.
particular, we have

in

/6 = 8 + h1,1  h2,1 + h3,1 .

(37)

for illustrative purposes, here we give the hodge numbers of the four-folds corresponding
6  z2 orbifolds (other cases are straightforward to work
to type i on the z
out):

12, and z

(h1,1, h2,1, h3,1) = (60, 1, 1) , /24 = 17 .

note that in the z
corresponding three-folds were also the same.

6 and z12 cases we have the same four-fold. this is not surprising as the

finally, we would like to apply the above map to f-theory to better understand the non-
perturbative inconsistency we have encountered in the z12 case with the particular gauge
bundle discussed in the previous subsection. the point here is that in the f-theory language

now, in the case of the four-fold compactications of f-theory we must specify the action of

the action of the orientifold projection  is geometrized - it is mapped to the action of ej.
ej not only on the four complex coordinates, but also on the gauge bundle. more precisely,
in, say, the z12 case we have to specify the action of the orbifold group z12 on various gauge
degrees of freedom, that is, we have to specify the gauge bundle. in the orientifold language
this is described by the chan-paton matrices, while in the heterotic language this is done
in terms of the spin(32)/z2 lattice shifts.
in the f-theory context we must also specify
the orbifold action of the corresponding gauge degrees of freedom. thus, in the z
3 example
3 orbifold acts geometrically on the three so(8)s (corresponding to d4
discussed above the z
singularities in the bre et 2) by permuting them - this is precisely what happens to the three
ej xed points a = ea/2, a = 1, 2, 3, under the action of z
3 on
the fourth so(8) (corresponding to the xed point 0 = 0) is no longer purely geometric - it
breaks so(8) down to u(4), which implies that there is non-trivial gauge bundle associated
with the embedding of the z
3 orbifold action on the corresponding gauge degrees of freedom.
the situation here is similar to what happens in the heterotic compactications - we must

3. however, the action of z

embed some number of instantons which break the gauge group. now, the action of ej on
the z12 twisted sectors as well as the corresponding gauge bundles must be one and the
same representation of the orbifold group. in the gauge bundle we discussed in the previous
subsection the orbifold group (in the four-fold context) is z2 z12, whereas its embedding in
terms of the gauge bundle would be the non-abelian dihedral group d12. these two actions
are clearly incompatible, hence the non-perturbative inconsistency (which, in particular,
manifests itself via a non-perturbative anomaly) in the z12 model.

vi. extensions

in the previous sections we have discussed various non-perturbative orientifolds corre-
sponding to type i compactications on k3 and calabi-yau three-folds. our discussion so

far has been conned to the cases with trivial ns-ns antisymmetric b-eld. it would be
interesting to understand non-perturbative orientifolds with non-zero b-eld, and one ex-
ample of such a compactication was recently discussed in [14]. we will not consider these
models in detail in this paper as we are planning to discuss such compactications elsewhere
[33]. however, here we would like to point out an additional set of models arising in the
perturbative k3 orientifolds (which complement those discussed in [4]) as their generaliza-
tions to non-perturbative orientifolds might lead to interesting new models in six and four
dimensions.

the key point here is the following. consider the  orientifold of type iib on t 4/z2
without the b-eld. this is the model of [1,2]. note that the action of the orbifold group
on the chan-paton factors is given by the chan-paton matrix

g = diag(ii8, ii8) ,

(38)

where g is the generator of z2. this corresponds to the gauge bundle without vector structure
(see section ii for details). here we can ask whether we can take the chan-paton matrix to
be given by

g = diag(i8, i8) ,

(39)

which would also satisfy the twisted tadpole cancellation conditions. in this case we would
have the gauge bundle with vector structure. however, this choice can be seen to be inconsis-
tent. the point is that the gauge group in this case is [sp(16)sp(16)]99[sp(16)sp(16)]55
(in our conventions sp(2n) has rank n), and the matter consists of hypermultiplets in

(16, 16; 1, 1)99 ,
1
2

(16, 1; 16, 1)59 ,

(1, 1; 16, 16)55 ,

1
2

(1, 16; 1, 16)59 .

note that in the 59 sectors we have half-hypermultiplets in real representations, which is
inconsistent, albeit the gravitational anomaly cancellation condition (6) is satised in this
case (note that the number of extra tensor multiplets is zero).

note, however, that, as was pointed out in [4], if we turn on the b-eld of rank b (b = 2, 4
in the case of k3 compactications), the 59 sector states come with multiplicity 2b/2 (while
the rank of the gauge group is reduced by 2b/2 [34,4]). this implies that the 59 sector
states no longer need to come in half-hypermultiplets. thus, consider the b = 2 case. the
chan-paton matrix is given by:

g = diag(i4, i4) .

(40)

the gauge group now is [sp(8)  sp(8)]99  [sp(8)  sp(8)]55, and the matter consists of
hypermultiplets in

(8, 8; 1, 1)99 ,
(8, 1; 8, 1)59 ,

(1, 1; 8, 8)55 ,
(1, 8; 1, 8)59 .

this spectrum is completely consistent, and, in particular, the gravitational anomaly cancels
(the number of extra tensor multiplets in this model is 4, which follows from the results of
[4]). note that this model was originally discussed in [1].

25

in fact, we can generalize the above discussion to other perturbative k3 orientifolds, that
is, the j  orientifolds of type iib on t 4/zn , n = 2, 3, 4, 6. (note that in the z2 case the
action of j  is trivial.) actually, in the z3 case nothing changes as we do not have a z2
subgroup, but in other cases we do obtain new models with non-zero b-eld. here we give
the twisted chan-paton matrices for these models, which we label [n, b] (g is the generator
of zn ):

[2, 2] :
[2, 4] :
[3, 2] :
[3, 4] :
[4, 2] :
[4, 4] :
[6, 2] :
[6, 4] :

g = diag(i4, i4) ,
g = diag(i2, i2) ,
g = diag(i4, 1i4) ,
g = i4 ,
g = diag(ii2, ii2, i2, i2) ,
g = diag(i, i, 1, 1) ,
g = diag(i2, i2, 1i2, 1i2) ,
g = diag(i2, i2) ,

(41)

where   exp(2i/3). these models, which were worked out in [35], are summarized
in table v. note that in all of these models the massless spectra satisfy the gravitational
anomaly cancellation condition (6). here we note that the [6, 2] model in table v is the
same as the corresponding [6, 2] model without vector structure discussed in [4]. also, the
[2, 4] and [6, 4] models in table v are the same. moreover, it is not dicult to show that
each of the [n, b] models in table v is on the same moduli as the corresponding [n, b] model
without vector structure discussed in [4].
