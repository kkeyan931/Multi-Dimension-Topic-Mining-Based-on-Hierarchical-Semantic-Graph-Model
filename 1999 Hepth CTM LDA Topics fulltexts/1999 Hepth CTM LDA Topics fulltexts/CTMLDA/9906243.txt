(4.14) potential (4.14) shows logarithmic attraction. clear consider case r l problem becomes three dimensional u1,2 1/r. note also, vortexantivortex interaction vortexvortex one limit mh = 0. thus clear vortices interact via attractive coulomb forces (u ln r r l u 1/r r l). however, know coulomb gas atraction unstable. means vortices condense attract coalesce destabilizing higgs branch. 22 exactly happens condensed matter superconductor external magnetic eld exceeds critical value. specic describe interaction string external higgs eld using eq.(4.2). form z d4xi(x)j(x), (4.15) j(x) =r d2(4)(x z())() string current. condensa- tion strings means j develops nonzero vev. (4.15) see would destabilize higgs branch. thus clear problem whether vortices condense not. going argue vortices condense higgs branch remains stable. first note, open strings could condense monopoles condense. however know monopoles condense even argyresdouglas point (where become massless) one avor monopoles eqs. (2.6) (2.7) solutions monopoles. still argument rule possibility condensation closed strings. general argument based n = 2 supersymmetry. (4.15) expect vortices condense would generate superpoten- tial (4.16) z d2 m0eqq , m0 proportional < j >. note mass term superpotential matter elds allowed n = 2 supersymmetry ( gauge elds absent, see, example, review {$9407087$}). however, (4.16) destabilize higgs branch. produce shift bare mass parameter m. argument even general nature. vortices destabilize higgs branch expect generate superpotential it. soon non-trivial superpotential allowed without breaking n = 2 supersymmetry conclude higgs branch stable. means vortices survive quantum theory giving rise conning potential (1.4) heavy well separated monopoles higgs branch. 23 5 conclusions paper studied vortices higgs branch seibergwitten model. showed vortices nite length exist classically produce conning potential (1.4) heavy monopoles. conning potential linear l use wilson loop order parameter distin- guish new conning phase specic higgs branches supersymmetric theories. studied stability vortices quantum theory. first, showed vortices grow transverse size rg. second, studied vortices string representation showed ano strings develop large uctuations string tension remains nonzero quantum theory. next ruled possibility vortices condense form coulomb gas attraction would destabilize higgs branch. conclusion vortices survive quantum theory producing new type conning phase monopoles potential (1.4). addressed problem calculating hadron mass spectrum higgs branch. shown string approach acceptable purpose. still quite plausible suggest general grounds lightest monopoleantimonopole meson becomes massless argyresdouglas point = . see reason let us recall root higgs branch = corresponds conformal eld theory non-trivial anomalous dimensions {$9311055$}. hadrons built monopoles massive point could integrate together photon multiplet scales 2 hqqi. would get -model charges q metric (the higgs branch admits unique hyper kahler metric). nothing prevents us taking limit hqqi 0, would get trivial xed point. correct values mass parameter except argyresdouglas points = , recover non-trivial conformal eld theory. possible resolution puzzle massless monopole (dyon) meson = () (see also {$9705181$}). still calculation hadron mass spectrum higgs branch remains open problem. 24 acknowledgments author grateful a. gorsky, a. marshakov, v. rubakov, a. schwim- mer useful discussions. particular, author would like thank a. vainshtein numerous illuminating discussions. also au- thor grateful theoretical physics group university min- nesota part work done hospitality. work supported russian foundation basic research grand no. 99- 02-16576. 25
