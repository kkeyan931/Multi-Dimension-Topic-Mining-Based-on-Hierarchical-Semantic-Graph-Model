1 introduction

in the comma approach to string eld theory, the theory of open-bosonic-
string is formulated as a generalized yang-mills theory [1]. in the comma
approach instead of choosing the bosonic coordinates x0 of the center of
mass and the coordinates xn for all other points relative to it as variables to
describe the string, one chooses as an alternative the coordinates

r(,  ) = 


if r = 1 ,

if r = 2 ,

x(,  ),
x(  ,  ),
  [0, /2) ,

where r = 1, 2 refers to the left (l), right (r) parts of the string and 1,2 are
restricted by

lim
/2

1(,  ) = lim
/2

2(,  ).

now the midpoint2 varies freely while the variation of the neighboring points
on the string is restricted.

in [2, 3] a fock space representation of the comma theory was developed.
k (corresponding to each half

there one introduces comma operators, bl
of the string) satisfying the commutation relations3

k , br

[br,
k , bs,

] = rsn+m,0,,

analogous to the commutation relations of a
n of the full string. the fock
space corresponding, to each half (comma) of the string was introduced in
[2, 3] leading to a basis for the fock space of our string in which the overall
motion of the string is unrestricted but neighboring points on the string are
not permitted to wander far from each other. the change of basis from the
full string to the comma theory is not a simple one . the explicit transforma-
tion relating both of them has been developed in [2, 3]. the commonly used
wittens string eld theory [4] (wsft) has of course the merit of being sim-
ple for constructing solutions of the free-string equation of motion. on the

2another approach in which the midpoint plays a central role has been discussed in

reference [5], although in a dierent context from references [2, 3].

other hand, the comma theory has the advantage of being more transparent
in questions connected with gauge invariance. in [3] we have addressed the
question of equivalence between the conventional and the comma formula-
tions of interacting string eld theory, also we examined the relationship of
the interacting vertex in both theories. in fact we were able to show directly

that the identity vertex (r ) , the 2  v ertex and the 4  v ertex in wsft

constructed in [6, 7] are solutions to the overlap equations in the comma
theory, hence establishing the equivalence (at least) at the level of the vertex
for n = 1, 2, 4. however, the assumption that the cubic interaction vertex
(which is of central importance) also solves the comma overlaps was not ver-
ied, and we accepted that v3 = i v4 (true in wittens theory) continue to
hold in the comma theory. this serious shortcoming is now removed by giv-
ing a direct proof that the cubic vertex in wsft is indeed a solution of the
comma overlaps.

the results presented here are obtained in the same way as in [3]; the
details, however, are rather more involved, as one might have anticipated.
although several computational details are relegated to the appendices, this
paper is not meant to be self-contained in the sense that we relay on [3] for
notation and indeed for many other details only alluded to below. for read-
ers interested in the formulation of the comma theory, a cursory reading of
reference [1] should suce. other subtleties related to the anomaly cancella-
tion for the identity vertex, the two vertex, the 3 vertex and the 4 vertex
were discussed in [3].

2 comma vertices

in the comma formulation of string eld theory the elements of the theory
are dened by -function type overlaps. the n interaction vertex is given
by

v [r

1, r

eiq(/2)

n

2, ..., r
n , r] =
/2
yi=1
y=0

(1

i ()  2

i1())(1

i ()  2

i1()) .

3

the index i refers to the ith string (it is understood that i = 0 and n are
identied) and 1, 2 refer to the left and right parts of the string respectively4.
as it is seen, the ghost -function has the same structure as the coordinates
one and q is the ghost number insertion. the formulation of the elements
of the comma theory in the oscillator hilbert space is given in references [2, 3]
where they are represented as exponentials of quadratic forms. here we are
interested in the cubic interaction vertex is given by

3 >= ep3
|v c

i=1 bl

i nbr 

i1 n

3

yi=1|0 >l

i

|0 >r

i

.

this vertex has the advantage of being more transparent and it is trivial to
generalize to an arbitrary number of strings which is not true in the case of the
standard formulation of string eld theory [6, 7]. in fact the generalization
of the above vertex is simply

n >= epn
|v c

i=1 bl

i nbr 

i1 n

n

yi=1|0 >l

i

|0 >r

i

.

in the oscillator hilbert space of the comma theory [3], the  functions, for the
coordinates (the ghost degrees of freedom, in the bosonized representation,
have the same structure apart from some mid-point insertions which will be
addressed later) translate into operator overlap equations, namely

hl
i ()  r

i1()i|vn >= 0 ,   [0, /2) ,

and i = 1, 2, .., n. in addition, conservation of momentum requires

hl
j () + r

j1()i|vn >= 0 .

these are now the overlaps dening equations for the comma vertices. to
simplify the calculation we introduce a new set of coordinates. following
gross and jevicki [6] we dene

qr
k() =

1
n

n

xl=1

r

l ()e

2ilk

n , r = 1, 2,

(1)

4to avoid confusion we may use the alternative label l(r) to refer to the lef t (right)

parts of the string respectively.

4

and similar ones for the momenta. the corresponding creation and annihila-
tion operators introduced in [3] are dened similarly and (for n  3) satisfy
the commutation relations

hbr
n,bs

mi = rsnm,

hbr
n,bs

mi = 0 .

the advantage of this new set of variables is that it leads to the separation
of degrees of freedom in the overlap equations. in the complex coordinates
(1), the overlap conditions l
j1() for the three string vertex, read

j () = r

ql() = e2i/3qr() ,   [0, /2) ,
ql
3 () = qr
1() = (qr

3 () ,   [0, /2) ,

j1() translate into

2()). for the complex momenta the overlap

where p r()  p r

in the comma theory is

with concrete matrices i and h (see reference [3]).
now our task is to show that wittens cubic vertex constructed in [6, 7] is a
solution of the above overlap equations. at this point it is worth mentioning
that it is not a trivial matter to show this, since one encounters various
double innite sums (the second coming from integrating  over the range
[0, /2) in formulating the comma theory). here the double innite sums
may not converge absolutely and the convergence may depend on the order
of the sums (so the expressions may be ambiguous). in fact when performing
these sums using the theory of contour integration one ends up with many
divergent pieces of dierent orders. the amazing thing is that all these
innities of dierent magnitudes conspire among them selves to leave us with
a nite number. the case of the full string [6, 7] is dierent, the expression

5

for the vertices involve absolutely convergent sums. this ambiguity is not
an accident, we have seen in [2, 3] that wittens theory can be viewed as
an innite dimensional local matrix algebra where the star product   
becomes matrix multiplication over innite dimensional matrices that does
not conserve associativity. in the standard formulation of string eld theory,
the wittens cubic vertex in oscillator basis (see reference [6] for details and
notation) is given by

3 >= exp(cid:18)
|v w

(a

|c|a

)  (a|u|a)(cid:19)

yi=1|0 >i ,

where cnm = ()nnm and unm is an innite dimensional matrix constructed
in [6]. the explicit form of the matrix u is given in appendix a. with the
help of the change of representation formulas (see reference [3]) we are able
to show that the comma overlaps are satised by the cubic vertex, i.e. we
will show that the comma overlaps continue to hold in the oscillator hilbert
space of the wittens cubic vertex.

3 proving the overlap equations

coordinate overlaps. we rst note that the second equation of the coordi-
nates overlaps (2), is the same as the overlap equation for the identity vertex
and therefore the proof follows from the form of the vertex [3]. hence we are
only left with the rst equation in (2) to verify. the overlap conditions on
qr(), equation (2), imply that their fourier components satisfy

hql
2n  e2i/3qr

2ni|v3 >= 0 .n  0

using the change of representation (see reference [3]) the above equation, in
the full string oscillator hilbert space reads

m|v w

since the states a
3 > are linearly independent, the expression in (5)
must vanish for all values of m. now there are three cases to consider m =
0, 2k  2 and 2k + 1  1. for m = 0, equation (5) reduces to
(2n + 1)3/2 u0 2n+1# .

where an are the coecients obtained in the taylors expansion of the func-

explicitly using the contour integral representation of the same coecients:

an =

zn+1 (cid:18) 1 + z

1  z(cid:19)1/3

.

now, to perform the sum we notice that in the complex plane we have the
cuts along the lines (1,) and (1,). deforming the contours and picking
the integrals along the cuts; then commuting the sum and the integral one
sees that the series inside the integral is easily converted to another integral
over a logarithmic function in two integration variables (say x, y). performing
the change of variable t = x+1
x1 followed by the change of variables x = 1/t
the whole expression reduces to various forms of special functions which are

easily read from standard tables of integrals. hence one obtains the following
value

to consider is m = 2k. in this case, equation (5) becomes

and the corresponding coecients bn, are obtained in the expansion of ((1 +

between them and the analogous coecients an and bn in the expansion of
the functions ((1 + x)/(1  x))1/3 and ((1 + x)/(1  x))2/3

an = ()n/2an , n = 2k ,
an = ()(n/2)an ,

n = 2k + 1 ,

and likewise for the bs. all the sums needed in the above expression are
worked out in the appendices. putting the explicit values for all the sums we

8

see that (8) is identically zero5. the last case to consider is m = 2k + 1  1.
in this case equation (5) reduces to

(10)

in this case it is a tedious job to perform the sums in (9) due to the
complicated form of the matrix (e(u  + u )e). this complication mainly
arises when n = k since in this case the expression for the matrix (e(u  +
u )e) becomes ill dened and one must consider a limiting procedure (n 
k). the explicit expression of the matrix (e(u  + u )e) for the diagonal
and o diagonal elements is give in reference [6]; however we shall rephrase
them in a compact form (see appendix a). first lets consider the sum over
the matrix u in (9).
it is clear from (10) that this sum consists of two
terms, one over the nonzero elements and one over the zero elements, we
call these two terms 1 and 2 respectively. using the explicit value of
(e(u  + u

the sum in (11) is potentially divergent and must be treated carefully. the
term for n = 0 should be understood as the limit of n  0 which follows
from our denition of the diagonal elements for the matrix (e(u  + u
)e)
(see appendix a). hence one writes

finally using the explicit value of u2k+1 0 and (14) we see that the expression
in the square bracket in (9) vanish. this completes the proof of the rst
equation in (4).

we have to show that this expression vanish for all values of m  0. the
case for m = 0 is straightforward to demonstrate and there is no need to give
it here. the other two cases (i.e., m = 2l  2 2l + 1  1), however, are much
harder. for m = 2l the above expression reduces to

the values of the matrix u2l+1 2n are given in appendix a. putting ev-
erything in equation (18) we see that it is identically zero. this completes
the proof for the coordinate overlaps.

momentum overlaps

the momentum overlaps in the comma theory are given by equation (3). the
second equation is the same as the overlap equation of the identity vertex
and therefore the proof follows from the form of the vertex. now the overlap
condition on p r(), given by the rst equation in (3), imply that its fourier
components satisfy

hp l
2n + e2i/3p r

2ni|v3 >= 0 n  0 .

(20)

as well as their complex conjugate. the proof of the case for n = 0 does not
involve new identities other than those used to prove the coordinate part and
therefore there is no need to give it here although we have checked that the
overlap equation for the zero mode is indeed satised. however, for n  1 the
proof requires deriving new identities . using the change of representation
formulas (see reference [3]), equation (20) reduces for n  1 to

in order for (21) to vanish, (22) must vanish for all values of k since the
states a
3 > are all linearly independent. therefore to prove the overlap
equation (20), it is sucient to show that (22) is identically zero for all values
of k. for k = 0 , (22) is zero as can be easily seen by explicit substitution
(no new identities are needed here). the other two case, i.e., k = even  2
and k = odd  1 need careful treatment since they involve quantities which
are potentially divergent. setting k = 2l in (22) we obtain
(cid:18)2n
first let us consider the case l 6= n since it is the easier of the two cases to
prove. then if one substitutes the explicit values of the matrix u for l 6= n
and makes use of the following identity

putting everything together and making use of the fact

n bnm = m bmn ,

we see that (27) is indeed zero. this completes the proof of the p overlaps.
ghost overlaps

to complete the proof we have to see if the ghost part of the wittens
cubic vertex satises (violates) the comma overlaps in exactly the same way
as in the standard formulation. the ghost part of the wittens vertex is
given by

|v 
3 >= e

3

2 i(/2)|v ,0

3 > .

3

here, the vertex |v ,0
3 > has the same form as the orbital part. the ghost
2 i(/2) corresponding to ghost number 3/2 is the right ghost number
factor e
[4]. expanding the phase factor and commuting the annihilation operator
through the creation part of the vertex results in doubling the creation part
of the insertion. thus one has

3 >= exp 3
|v 



xn=1

()n
2na

3 2n!|v ,0

3 > .

17

the quadratic part of the vertex |v ,0
3 > satises the comma overlap equa-
tions since it has the same structure as the orbital part which solves the
comma overlaps as we have already seen. however, when one includes the
ghost insertion this is no longer the case. to see this one rst observes that
the comma overlaps for v3 are blind to the phase factor7 (insertion) apart
from

ql
3 2n = qr
p l
3 2n = p r

3 2n , n  0,
3 2n , n  0.

in fact the rst of these equations is also blind to the insertion factor,
since it contains only odd modes in the annihilation-creation operator a3
which clearly commute with the even modes in the phase factor. on the
other hand, the second equation contains even modes of the operator a3 and
therefore is not satised by the vertex due to the insertion. to see this notice
that

where r = 1, 2 refers to the left and right parts of the string respectively.
thus commuting the overlaps through the insertion factor and collecting
terms we obtain

exp 3



xn=1

()n
2na

3 2n!"

3

()n
2n

+ p l

3 2n + p r

now it is clear that the overlaps in the square bracket are not satised by
the quadratic part of the ghost vertex because of the presence of a cnumber.
this is the same violation seen in the operator formulation of wittens string
eld theory (see reference [6]). therefore the comma overlaps are satised
(violated) by the wittens cubic vertex in exactly the same way as in the case
of the standard formulation[6, 7]. this completes the proof that the wittens
cubic vertex is a solution to the comma overlaps.

7the reason for this is that the other overlaps describe dierent strings in the complex

space as we have already seen.

18

4 conclusions

we have demonstrated that the cubic vertex in wittens string eld theory,
making use of the operator formalism as developed in references [6, 7], solves
the comma overlaps. however, as we have seen in [3], there are still few
subtleties which must be understood if one is to get greater condence in
the comma approach to string eld theory. for example, as pointed out
in reference [3], while in the full string formulation, the k and the brst
invariance require some specic ghost insertions at the midpoint of the string
for consistency, it does not seem to be the case in the comma formalism. in
the comma theory both the orbital and the ghost parts of the cubic vertex
are invariant separately. also in the same reference we have seen that the
associativity anomaly in the star algebra of the standard formulation of string
eld theory disappears in the comma theory. the q or gauge invariance in the
comma representation have only been mentioned in reference [3]. however,
for a complete discussion, it is useful to use a fermionic representation of
the comma ghost. in the fermionic representation it is possible to construct
the analogous comma (ghost) cubic vertex and examine other properties of
standard string theory in the comma representation, for completeness, we
still have to show that the cubic ghost vertex in the fermionic representation
of wittens string eld theory still solves the comma overlaps of the ghost
in the fermionic representation. this fact and the proper treatment of the
brst operator q will be given in a separate publication [10].

it is worth observing that expressions for the matrix elements of u for
the o diagonal elements dened by (a.4) for n = odd, m = odd and the
diagonal elements dened by (a.7) for n = odd can be combined into a single
expression. this observation is instrumental in making the evaluation of the

the expression for 1, after performing several integrations (when integrating

preserve all the divergent pieces; they do cancel among themselves rendering
the whole quantity nite), reduces to

this expression can be further reduced by integration by parts. again one
has to be careful since integration by parts give rise to many divergent terms
as one approaches the branch points. these divergent terms have dierent
magnitudes and one must keep a track of them as they conspire at the end
to give a nite number. all in all, we end up with

from the recursion relation (b.3) it follows that

where



first lets derive the identity in (12). consider

wmn = wnm 

ambn + bman

m + n

.

now it is not hard to see (by direct substitution) that

(m+ 1)wm+1 n(m1)wm1 n + (n+ 1)wm n+1(n1)wm n1 = 0 , (b.2)
for m + n = odd integer. letting m  2m  1, n  2n and summing over
m  1 we get
(b.3)

where

the value of w1 can be evaluated using the integral representation of the
taylor coecients. the steps involved in calculating w1 are similar to the
ones leading to (b.1). doing so we get w1 = 2 and identity (12) follows.
next consider the identity given in (12). if we dene

tnm = tmn 

ambn  bman

m  n

,

then it follows that

(n + 1)tn+1 m  (n  1)tn1 m + (m + 1)tn m+1  (m  1)tn m1 = 0 ,

for m + n = odd integer. now letting m  2m  1  1, n  2n  2 and
summing over m we arrive at

(2n + 1)



xm=1

t2n+1 2m1 = (2n  1)



xm=1

t2n1 2m1 ,

(b.4)

27

from which (12) follows.

to derive (26) let n  m in (b.2) and then letting n  2n  1  1,

m  2m  2 and summing over m we get

2n(cid:16)a2nsb

2n + b2nsa

2n2 + b2n2sa

2n2(cid:17)

=

2n

[a2n1 + b2n1  a2n2b2n2]

the expression inside the square bracket is most easily evaluated using the
integral representation of the taylor coecients. the resulting integrals are
easily evaluated and yield zero. hence, (b.4) reduces to

2n(cid:16)a2nsb

2n + b2nsa

2n(cid:17)  (2n  2)(cid:16)a2n2sb

2n2 + b2n2sa

2n2(cid:17) = 0 .

solving (b.5) we get

c2n  a2nsb

2n + b2nsa

2n =

2n

c2 .

this solution depends on the value of c2 which is given by

c2 = a2sb

2 + b2sa

2 = 1 .

it can be easily found using the results:

and (12). substituting the value of c2 back into (b.6) we arrive at (26).

we conclude this appendix by deriving two more identities which are
needed in the proof of the momentum overlaps. consider the recursion
relation given in (a.3)

(n + 1) a
