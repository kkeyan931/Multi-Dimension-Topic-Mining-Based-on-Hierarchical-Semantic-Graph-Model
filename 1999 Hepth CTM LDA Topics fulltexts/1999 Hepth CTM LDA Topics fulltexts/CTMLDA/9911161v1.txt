abstract

we study brane congurations that give rise to large-n gauge
theories with eight supersymmetries and no hypermultiplets. these
congurations include a variety of wrapped, fractional, and stretched
branes or strings. the corresponding spacetime geometries which we
study have a distinct kind of singularity known as a repulson. we nd
that this singularity is removed by a distinctive mechanism, leaving
a smooth geometry with a core having an enhanced gauge symmetry.
the spacetime geometry can be related to large-n seibergwitten
theory.

1 introduction

understanding the physics of spacetime singularities is a challenge for any
complete theory of quantum gravity. it has been shown that string theory

resolves certain seeming singularities, such as orbifolds [1], ops [2], and
conifolds [3], in the sense that their physics is completely nonsingular. on

the other hand, it has also been argued that certain singularities should not
be resolved, but rather must be disallowed congurations  in particular,

negative mass schwarzschild, which would correspond to an instability of
the vacuum [4]. also, in the study of perturbations of the ads/cft duality
various singular spacetimes have been encountered, and at least some of these

must be unphysical in the same sense as negative mass schwarzschild. a more
general understanding of singularities in string theory is thus an important

goal.

in this paper we study a naked singularity of a particular type, which has

been dubbed the repulson [5, 6]. a variety of brane congurations in string
theory appear to give rise to such a singularity. however, we will argue that
this is not the case. rather, as the name might suggest, the constituent

branes eectively repel one another (in spite of supersymmetry), forming in
the end a nonsingular shell.

our interest in this singularity arose from a search for new examples of
gauge/gravity duality. in particular, the brane congurations that give rise
to the repulson singularity have on their world-volumes pure d = 4, n = 2
gauge theory (or the equivalent in other dimensions), as opposed to the usual
pure d = 4, n = 4, or d = 4, n = 2 with hypermultiplets. we do not
precisely nd such a duality, in the sense of using supergravity to calculate
properties of the strongly coupled gauge theory, but we do nd a striking

parallel between the moduli space of the large-n su(n) gauge theory and
the fate that we have deduced for the singularity. we also nd some clues

which allow us to guess at aspects of a possible dual.

2

in section 2 we describe the repulson singularity and the various brane
congurations where it arises. in section 3 we deduce the specic physical

mechanism by which it is removed. in section 4 we relate this to behavior
of yangmills theory with eight supersymmetries. we do not nd a duality,

in the sense of being able to use supergravity to calculate in the strongly
coupled gauge theory, but we nd a striking parallel between the physical
picture deduced in section 3 and the large-n seibergwitten theory. we

point out some features suggestive of a dual theory, and remark upon the
case of nite temperature. in section 5 we develop two of the dual versions,

in terms of bent ns5-branes, and wrapped/fractional d-branes. section 6
oers brief conclusions, and suggestions for future directions.

1234-directions transverse to all branes, and m runs over the 6789-directions
of a t 4, tangent to the d5-branes and transverse to the d1-branes. we have

this conguration leaves 8 unbroken supersymmetries, all of which trans-
form as (2, 1) under the so(4) that acts on xi. at the horizon, r  0, the
geometry approaches ads3 s3  t 4, giving rise to an ads/cft duality [7].
the tension of the eective string in 6 dimensions is

 =

1
g

(q55v + q11)

(2.3)

with 5 = (2)53 and 1 = (2)11.

now imagine taking q1 < 0, but keeping the same unbroken supersym-
metry. this is not the same as replacing the d1-branes with anti-d1-branes,
which would leave unbroken (1, 2) supersymmetries instead. rather, the so-
lution (2.1) is simply continued to q1 < 0, so that r2
1 < 0. this radically
changes the geometry: the radius r = |r1| is now a naked singularity [5, 6],
and the region r < |r1| is unphysical. also, the tension (2.3) can vanish and
apparently even become negative.

in spite of these odd properties, the case q1 < 0 can be realized phys-
ically. to do this, replace the t 4 with a k3, with q5 d5-branes wrapped
on the k3. then as shown in ref. [8], the coupling of the d5-brane to the
curvature induces a d1-brane charge q1 = q5. for gq5 suciently large
the solution (2.1) with q1 = q5 (and with dxidxi replaced by the metric
of a k3 of volume v ) would be expected to be a good description of the

geometry.

the low energy theory on the branes is pure supersymmetric yangmills

with eight supersymmetries [8], in 1 + 1 dimensions. one can understand
this from the general result that the number of hypermultiplets minus vector
multiplets is nh  nv = q5q1, from 1-5 strings. continuing to q1 = q5
gives nh  nv = q2
5, corresponding to the u(q5) adjoint without hyper-
multiplets.1

1for larger q1, we can also study the case of su (n ) with nf fundamental avours. it
is amusing to note that the case nf = 2n corresponds to q1 = 0, which means that z1 = 1
and the supergravity solution simplies greatly. this is pertinent for the four-dimensional
case which is superconformal.

4

by dualities one can nd many other brane congurations with singular-
ities of the same sort, and with the same low energy gauge theory in p + 1

dimensions. our interest in this solution arose from the search for supergrav-
ity duals to these gauge theories, and we will return to this point in section 4.

by t -dualities on the noncompact directions one obtains solutions with dp
and d(p + 4) charge, for p = 0, 1, 2, and 3. by t -dualities on the whole
k3 one can replace the d(p + 4)-branes wrapped on the k3 with d(p + 2)-
branes wrapped on a nontrivial s2 with self-intersection number 2. this
latter realization can also be obtained as follows. consider n d3-branes at
a z2 orbifold singularity [9]. the low energy gauge theory is u(n)  u(n)
with hypermultiplets in the (n, n). by going along the coulomb branch in
the direction diag(i,i) one gives masses to all the su(n) su(n) hyper-
multiplets. this corresponds to separating the branes along the singularity

into two clumps of n half-branes, which are secretly [10, 11, 12] d5-branes
wrapped on the collapsed s2 (the half d3-brane charge comes from the  = 
b-eld at the orbifold point).2 a t -duality on this brane-wrapped ale space
results in another dual realization, this time involving a pair of ns5-branes
with n d(p + 1)-branes stretched between them [13].

finally, by an s-duality the p = 0 case can be related to the heterotic
string on t 4, with n bps winding strings having nl = 0. these are the
strings which become massless non-abelian gauge bosons at special points
in moduli space, a fact that will play an important role in the next section.
similarly, the p = 2 case s-dualizes [14] to a combination of the kaluzaklein

monopole and the h-monopole [15, 16] which is equivalent [17] to the a = 1
magnetic black hole in four dimensions. in this heterotic form, these solutions

have previously been considered by behrndt, kallosh, and linde [5, 6].

the nature of the singularity was studied in ref. [6]. it was shown that

2this realization has also been considered recently by e. gimon and in refs. [18].
the latter consider m wrapped d5-branes plus n d3-branes, producing gauge group
su (n )  su (n + m ) with bifundamental hypermultiplets. the focus of these papers is
m  n , whereas ours is the opposite limit n = 0.

5

massive particles coupled to the einstein metric feel an innite repulsive
potential at the singularity, hence the name repulson. if instead one takes as

probes the same kind of d5-brane as forms the geometry, then by the usual
supersymmetry argument the potential should vanish. hence there should be

no obstruction to building this geometry from a collection of such d5-branes.
however, we will nd in the next section that this argument fails for a reason
specic to the repulson geometry, so that in fact the geometry is smoothed

out in a certain way, and the singularity removed.

3 the enhancon geometry

for q1 < 0 the gauge theory has no higgs branch (which would correspond
to one or more bound states), and so for p  1 infrared uctuations might
prevent the existence of a stable object. for this reason we will focus on the
d2-d6 example in this section,

a d6-brane probe (wrapped on the k3) has a well-dened moduli space.

to understand better the physics of the repulson geometry, consider the
eective action of such a probe,

s = zm

d3 e(r)(6v (r)  2)( det gab)1/2 + 6zm k3

c7  2zm

c3 .

(3.4)

here m is the projection of the world-volume onto the six noncompact dimen-
sions and gab is the induced metric. we have written this down on physical
grounds. the rst term is the dirac action with the position-dependence of
the tension (3.3) taken into account; in particular, v (r) = v z2(r)/z6(r).
the second and third terms are the couplings of the probe charges (q6, q2) =
(1,1) to the background. note that to derive this action from the full d6-
brane action requires two curvature-squared terms. one appears in the wz

action and accounts for the induced d2 charge [8, 19]. the other appears in
the dirac action and produces the 2 term in the tension [20].

expanding the action (3.4) in powers of the transverse velocity gives the

lagrangian density

(3.5)

the position-dependent potential terms cancel as expected for a supersym-
metric system, leaving the constant potential (6v  2)/g and a nontrivial
metric on moduli space as expected with eight supersymmetries. the metric
is proportional to

6v z2  2z6 = (2)23/2  v

v  1 

gn1/2

r

! .

(3.6)

we assume that v > v  (2)42, so that the metric at innity (and
the membrane tension) are positive. however, as r decreases the metric

7

eventually becomes negative, and this occurs at a radius

r =

2v

v  v|r2|  re

(3.7)

which is strictly greater than the radius rr = |r2| of the repulson singularity.
to understand what is happening, note that this kinetic term comes en-
tirely from the dirac term in the action (3.4), and that what is vanishing is the
factor 6v (r)2 in the probe tension. this occurs when v (r) = 2/6 = v,
and so before the singularity (where v (r) goes to 0). the negative tension
at re > r > rr is clearly unphysical. to see how we should interpret it,
recall that the probe is dual to a heterotic winding string, and the vanishing

of the tension corresponds to the vanishing of the winding string mass at a
point of enhanced gauge symmetry. it is well-known that the latter can be
interpreted as the ordinary higgs mechanism. in the higgs mechanism the

mass is related to the expectation value by

m = || ;

(3.8)

note the absolute value.

therefore we should take (minus) the absolute value in the rst term of

the action (3.4) and (3.5). now the metric is positive but another problem
appears: the potential no longer cancels, but rises as r decreases below re.
this means that we cannot move the probe to r < re in a supersymmetric
way, and so contradicts the assumption that we can build the repulson ge-

ometry by bringing together a succession of wrapped d6-branes. thus we
are led to a very dierent picture: the n d6-branes all live on the sphere
at r = re. even if we try to build the geometry by starting with coincident
d6-branes at g = 0, where r2 = rr = re = 0, and then increasing the cou-
pling, we would expect the system to expand as g is increased. we will see

an interesting parallel to this behavior in the gauge theory discussion of the
next section.

8

with this picture, the geometry (3.1) is correct only down to r = re.
since the sources are all at this radius, the geometry should be at in the
interior 0 < r < re:3

ds2 = [z2(re)z6(re)]1/2dxdx + [z2(re)z6(re)]1/2dxidxi + v 1/2
e2 = g2z2(re)/z6(re) ,

 ds2

k3 ,

c3 = c7 = 0 .

(3.9)

note that the non-zero potential that appeared in the proof-by-contradiction
is not a real feature, because the geometry (3.1) is no longer relevant for
r < re. indeed, it is dicult to see how such a potential could be consistent
with supersymmetry.

now, however, we seem to have another contradiction. there seems to

be no obstacle to the probe moving into the at region (3.9), contradicting
the conclusion that the d6-branes are xed at re. to see the obstacle we
must look more deeply. note that in the interior region the k3 volume takes
the constant value v, meaning that the probe is a tensionless membrane. a
tensionless membrane sounds even more exotic than a tensionless string, but

in fact (as in other examples) it is actually prosaic: it is best interpreted as a
composite in an eective eld theory. note that the ratios 0/4=2/6=v
are equal. this means that a wrapped d4-brane is a massless particle when-
ever the wrapped d6-brane is tensionless. in fact, it is a non-abelian gauge

boson, which together with an rr vector and a wrapped anti-d4-brane form
an enhanced su(2) gauge symmetry. that is, in the interior geometry there

is an unbroken su(2) gauge symmetry in six dimensions. for this reason we
refer to this as the enhancon geometry, and the radius re as the enhancon
radius.

now, a two-dimensional object in six dimensions would be obtained by
lifting a point object in four, and so a magnetic monopole naturally sug-

3 we assume that v = v in the interior by continuity of the metric. c. vafa suggests

that there may be an overshoot, by analogy with ref. [21].

9

gests itself. indeed, the wrapped d4-brane is a source of a 2-form rr eld
strength in six dimensions, and the wrapped d6-brane is the source of the

dual 4-form eld strength. the mass of a monopole is proportional to the
mass of the corresponding w boson, so they vanish together when v (r) = v.

since the size of the monopole is inverse to the mass of the w boson, there
is no sense in which a probe can be localized within the enhancon radius.
for this same reason the probe begins to expand as it approaches re, so it
appears that it will essentially melt smoothly into the shell of n monopoles
at re. this has the eect that junction between the exterior geometry (3.1)
and the interior geometry (3.9) is smoothed.

we can estimate this smoothing eect as follows. the mass of a wrapped
d-brane is m(r) = e4(v  v). the probe will cease to be eectively
pointlike when

leading to

m(r)(r  re)g1/2

rr  1 ,

(r  re)  ren 1/2 .

(3.10)

(3.11)

thus we have a consistent picture in which the repulson is replaced by a
smooth geometry.4

the same principle holds for other values of p. the enhancon locus is
s4p  rp+1, whose interior is (5 + 1)-dimensional. for even p the theory in
the interior has an su(2) gauge symmetry, while for odd p there is an a1
(2,0) theory. this is consistent with the fact that a k3 with volume v is
t -dual to a k3 at an a1 singularity. the details of the smoothing depend
on p, and for p  1 it is likely that the ir uctuations must be considered.5
note that our result for the lagrangian density (3.5) depends only on
three moduli space coordinates, (x3, x4, x5), or (r, , ) in polar coordinates.
for a (2+1)-dimensional theory with eight supercharges, the moduli space

4r. myers and a. strominger suggest that this may apply to more general reissner

nordstrom-like singularities.

5we thank s. sethi for discussions on this point.

metric must be hyperkahler [22]. a minimum requirement for this is of
course that it has four coordinates, and so we must nd an extra modulus.
on the probe, there is an extra u(1) gauge potential aa, corresponding to
the overall centre of mass degree of freedom. we may exchange this for a

scalar s by hodge duality in the (2+1)-dimensional world-volume. this is of
course a feature specic to the p = 2 case.

to get the coupling for this extra modulus correct, we should augment the
probe computation of the previous section to include aa. the dirac action
is modied by an extra term in the determinant:

 detgab  det(gab + 2fab) ,

(3.12)

where fab is the eld strength of aa. furthermore, in the presence of fab,
there is a coupling

 22zm

c1  f ,

(3.13)

where c1 = cd is the magnetic potential produced by the d6-brane charge:
c = (r6/g) cos . adapting the procedures of refs. [23, 24], we can intro-
duce an auxiliary vector eld va, replacing 2fab by e2(6v (r)2)2vavb
in the dirac action, and adding the term 2rm f v overall. treating va as

a lagrange multiplier, the path integral over va will give the action involving
f as before. alternatively, we may treat fab as a lagrange multiplier, and
integrating it out enforces

abcb(2 cc + vc) = 0 .

(3.14)

here, cc are the components of the pullback of c1 to the probes world-
volume. the solution to the constraint above is

2 ca + va = as ,

(3.15)

where the scalar s is our fourth modulus. we may now replace va by as 
2 ca in the action, and the static gauge computation gives for the kinetic

11

4 gauge theory

4.1 the search for a duality

one of the goals of this work is to obtain a useful dual description of the

physics of strongly coupled su(n) gauge theory (with eight supercharges and
no hypermultiplets) at large-n. this is a necessarily complex undertaking,
as there are at least four dierent theories which play important roles here,

and so in the spirit of ref. [25], we should carefully determine where each
theory has a weakly coupled description, as we change the energy scale.

to get to the limit where we obtain the decoupled gauge theory we hold

xed the induced p-dimensional gauge coupling

g2
ym,p = (2r)4g2

p+4 = (2)p2g(p+1)/2r4

(4.1)

and, as usual [7], hold xed u = r/. let us also dene the (p + 1)-
dimensional t hooft coupling

p  g2

ym,pn

(4.2)

where n is the number of d(p + 4)-branes wrapped on the k3. we write the
k3 volume as v  (2r)4; the background has a good limit if we hold this
xed as well. then the string metric becomes, in the decoupling limit,

ds2
 = [hp(u) (1  hp(u))]1/2 r2dxdx

the dilaton becomes

note that the 1 has scaled out of zp+4 but not zp.

where u = |u|. this is sensible only for 3 < u < 7. at u = 3, the
inner radius, z3 vanishes: this is the repulson, which is again unphysical,
lying inside the enhancon. at u = 7, the outer radius, z7 vanishes and the
dilaton diverges. near this radius there is a story similar to that at the inner
radius: nonperturbative corrections remove the singularity. for n  24, this
is understood in terms of (choke) f-theory [26]. for n > 24, as here, the

details are not so well understood, but should not be relevant to the physics
in the enhancon region.

returning to p < 3, can work out where the supergravity description
(4.3,4.5) is good by demanding [25] that the curvature in string units and
the dilaton both be small. for the curvature, we nd

r = gp(u)u (p+1)/2(pr4)1/2  (1  hp(u))5/2 ,

(4.7)

where the functions gp(u) are o(1) for all u  ue.

13

the rst thing we notice about the curvature is its value at the enhancon

radius:

the control parameter

r|e  (pr3p)2/(3p) .

  pr3p

(4.8)

(4.9)

will determine the nature of the phase diagram. the physical interpreta-

tion of  is the value of the dimensionless t hooft coupling of the (p + 1)-
dimensional gauge theory at the energy scale 1/r, which is an eective uv

cuto. below this scale, since the physics is superrenormalizable, the eec-
tive coupling grows, becoming strong at e < 1. at this point the gauge
theory ceases to be a useful description, we have the right to look for a super-
gravity (or other) dual. if p is small, we expect to nd a region of the phase
diagram where gauge theory is a weakly coupled description. otherwise, we
will have only supergravity phases. the interesting case is therefore   1,
so that we have at least one region where the gauge theory is weakly coupled.

we will take

pr3p  1

(4.10)

for the remainder of this subsection.

in satisfying this condition, we nd that the supergravity geometry is

strongly curved at the enhancon radius. since the supergravity elds do not
evolve inside the enhancon, this is the maximum curvature. at the enhancon

radius, we can also inspect the dilaton; it is
pr3p

e(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)e 

n  1 .

(4.11)

from the equation (4.5), we nd that the dilaton increases monotonically

with u. it becomes of order one at

u 3p
2  pn 4/(p+1)(pr3p)4/(p+1)

(4.12)

at radii u > u2, we will need to use the s-dual supergravity description.
since at these radii the eect of zp is very small, by comparison to the eect

14

of zp+4, we are in fact matching on to the picture obtained by [25] for the
d(p + 4)-branes alone; the physics involving the k3 is essentially irrelevant.

we now need to nd the degrees of freedom best suited to describing
the physics for ue < u < u2. as u decreases from u2, the curvature of
the d = 10 supergravity geometry will become stronger; it becomes of order
unity at

u p+1
1  1/pr4

(4.13)

at this place, the (p + 5)-dimensional gauge theory will take over. we can
see this by starting with its dimensionless t hooft coupling as a function of

gauge theory energy e

p+4ep+1 .

(4.14)

now, in order to relate e to u we need an ir/uv relation for the strings
stretched between the probe brane and the source branes. since the source
branes are distributed on a s4p shell at the enhancon radius, the relation
is e = u  ue, where 1    1 encodes which brane on the shell the
stretched string attaches to. in addition, we have the condition on the control
parameter   1, so that u1, 1/r  ue and thus the size of the shell is not
important. so the ir/uv relation is to good accuracy e = ue. therefore
we see that the dimensionless t hooft coupling of the (p + 5)-dimensional
gauge theory is order one at u1. it decreases for smaller u.

we also have the induced lower-dimensional gauge theory with dimen-

sionless coupling

pep3 .

(4.15)

the crossover between the (p + 5)- and (p + 1)-dimensional gauge theories is
clearly at e = 1/r. at lower energies i.e. smaller u, the (p+1)-dimensional

gauge theory takes over. however, this time its dimensionless t hooft cou-
pling increases as u decreases, i.e. exhibits the opposite behavior to the

(p + 5)-dimensional gauge theory. this is consistent with the physics of the
n = 4 supersymmetric systems studied in [25]. the dimensionless t hooft

15

coupling of the (p + 1)-dimensional theory becomes strong at

e0  1/(3p)

p

(4.16)

let us now recall the enhancon radius, dened by h(u) = 1/2, or u 3p  2p.
from our previous considerations of a probe in the background of n branes,
we found that the branes were (evenly) distributed on a s4p shell of this
radius. the energy of a string stretched between any two branes in this shell
must therefore fall between

(p)1/(3p)/n 1/(4p) < e < (p)1/(3p)

(4.17)

the energy at which the p-dimensional gauge theory becomes strong is then
precisely the energy at which the physics of the system is described by some

theory whose dynamics includes only the bps strings stretched between the
source branes (and of probe branes so close to the enhancon radius that they

too can be thought of as source branes).

at the very lowest energies we can simply use the moduli space description

of the physics.

the gap that remains in building our phase diagram is an understanding
of the physics in the energy range (4.17). the curvature is strong there and

thus we fail to nd a supergravity dual for the strongly coupled (p + 1)-
dimensional gauge theory. a further indication of that failure is the explicit

appearance of r in the metric (4.3): in the gauge theory, r enters the physics
only through the parameter g2
ym,p, and therefore should not explicitly appear
in a dual description.

so we have a mystery here. a natural suggestion for p = 2 (with a
suitable generalization involving the a1 theory for p = 3) is that the dual is
the (5+1)-dimensional su(2) gauge theory in the n-monopole sector, where
they are just becoming massless. note that this su(2) gauge theory is part

of the bulk physics, so what we are conjecturing is that it is the only relevant
part and that the supergravity can be omitted. a weak test is that it give

16

the correct moduli space, and it does. note also that the enhancon geometry
has a natural interpretation in the gauge theory: in the n-monopole sector
the higgs eld has a zero of order n. the function rn is essentially zero (the
at interior) until rising sharply. thus a classical monopole solution of large

charge might be expected to have its charge distributed in a thin shell. to
go further we need a new expansion to describe this system, which becomes
weak for n large. it appears that the spacing of the monopoles, of order
n 1/2 times the enhancon radius, plays the role of a non-commutativity
parameter, because the sphere has been eectively broken up into n domains.

in any case, the mysterious dual description should include the dynamics of
these stretched strings at large-n.

again, the case p = 3 needs special treatment. to orient ourselves, we
may review the case of d7-branes by themselves. using the equations (4.6),

we nd that the scalar curvature in string units is

r  hnu 2 (log(7/u))5/2i1

,

(4.18)

and this becomes order unity when u = u1  ()1/2(gn)1/4. substi-
tuting this into the dimensionless t hooft coupling on the d7-branes, we

nd that the gauge coupling is order unity at the same place, and so the
(7 + 1)-dimensional gauge theory and ten-dimensional supergravity parts of
the phase diagram t together as required. the dilaton becomes order unity
when u = 7e2/n  7, and because n > 24, the nature of this theory
beyond the supergravity approximation is unclear.

let us now add the d3-branes. the eect on the curvature is essentially to
multiply the above result by a factor z 1/2
. out at large values of u such as
u1 and 7, the eect of the z3-factor must be unimportant, by analogy with
the lower-p cases. now, recall that at the scale 1/r, the (7 + 1)-dimensional
gauge theory crosses over to the (3 + 1)-dimensional gauge theory, and the

3

coupling must be weak there in order for there to be gauge theory descriptions
at all. therefore 3  1, and as a consequence we nd 3  1/r, a condition

necessary for clean separation of some of the phases as in the lower-p cases.
the remaining conditions needed for clean separation of the other phases
involve 7 and remain somewhat puzzling. we assume, by analogy with the
p < 3 cases, that they are met.

we summarize our ndings in the phase diagram in gure 1.

to get a little more information on the mystery theory we may consider
going to nite temperature, or adding energy to the branes. the rst change

to the supergravity solution is that a nonextremality function k(u) appears

in order for the supergravity horizon at u = u0 to lie outside the en-
hancon locus, we need a suciently large energy density  on the branes.

(4.22)

where we have used the condition (4.10). this cannot be satised in the
(p+1)-dimensional gauge theory, and this is further evidence that the mys-

terious theory is not gravitational.

4.2 the metric on moduli space

although we have failed to nd a weakly coupled dual for the gauge theory,

a study of the coulomb branch of the gauge theory reveals a striking parallel
to our probe computations. focusing on the case p = 2, suppose that the

condition (4.10) holds, so the low energy physics can be described by a (2+1)-
dimensional gauge theory. the metric that the probe sees, after applying the

scaling of the previous section to eqn. (3.16), gives the metric on moduli space
for the su(n) (2+1)-dimensional gauge theory in the decoupling limit:

l = f (u)(cid:16) u 2 + u 2 2(cid:17) + f (u)1(cid:18)  

2

n

82 a (cid:19)

,

(4.23)

6the reason that the branes are aected asymmetrically by nonextremality is that we

held r xed in the decoupling limit; it does not scale with the string length.

19

where

f (u) =

1
82g2

ym  1 



u! ,

(4.24)

the u(1) monopole potential is a = 1  cos , and  = s/2, and the
metric is meaningful only for u>ue = . our metric (4.23) is the euclidean
taubnut metric, with a negative mass.
it is a hyperkahler manifold,
because f = a, where a = (n/82)ad.

it is striking that the moduli space metric is the same as that which
can be derived from eld theory, where this has the interpretation as the

tree-level plus one-loop result. it is also interesting to note that while the
scaled supergravity solution failed to give a dual, the result for the probes

moduli space is independent of v . both of these facts could be understood
if supersymmetry prevented v from appearing in the probe metric: one

can use v as the control parameter to move from weak gauge theory to
weak supergravity. on the surface this does not seem to be the case  the
probe moduli live in a vector multiplet, and so does v  but a more careful

analysis may be needed. so there is a mystery here, perhaps conrming our
suggestions in the previous section that there is a useful duality to be found.

we see that the enhancon phenomenon is the same as the familiar fact
that the tree-level plus one-loop kinetic term goes negative  the landau

pole. this metric is of course singular, and is therefore incomplete. as shown
by seiberg and witten, it receives no perturbative corrections but is xed

nonperturbatively. it is the large r expansion of the metric on the moduli
space of n monopoles. there are nonperturbative instanton corrections to
this metric which smooth it out into a generalization of the atiyahhitchin

manifold [27].
in the two-monopole case studies in ref. [28], the atiyah
hitchin manifold is the unique smooth completion of the taubnut metric

consistent with the condition of hyperkahlerity. (see refs. [28, 29, 13, 30] for
examples of generalizations and further study.)

to discuss quantitatively the nonperturbative corrections to the metric on

20

moduli space it is simpler to look at the case p = 3. on the gauge theory side,
the metric on moduli space is obtained from the seibergwitten curve [31],

which for su(n) is [32]

y2 =

n

(x  i)2  2n .
yi=1

(4.25)

the point of maximal unbroken gauge symmetry, which in the present case
can only be the weyl subgroup, is

i = 0 ,

all i .

(4.26)

earlier work on the large-n limit [33] focused on a dierent point in moduli

space, but this highly symmetric point would seem to be the most natural
place to look for a supergravity dual. the branch points y = 0 are at

x = eik/n ,

0  k  2n  1 .

(4.27)

this ring of zeros is reminiscent of the enhancon, and is in fact the same. to
see this add a probe brane at ,

y2 = x2n (x  )2  2n +2 .

for || > , there are 2n zeros which closely approximate a ring,

x  eik/n (eik/n  /)1/n ,

0  k  2n  1 ,

(4.28)

(4.29)

the new factor, in parentheses, being 1 + o(1/n). the remaining two zeros
are at x  , or more precisely

x    (/)2n ,

(4.30)

the correction being exponentially small. on the other hand, for || < , all
2n + 2 branch points lie approximately in a ring,7

x  eik/(n +1)(1  eik/(n +1)/)1/n ,

0  k  2n + 1 .

7inserting either form (4.29) or (4.31) into the polynomial (4.28) produces a solution
to order 1, which can be further improved by an o(n 2) correction to x. the dierence
between the two ranges of / is that the terms in parentheses are arranged so as not to
circle the origin, so that the 1/n root comes back to its original value as k increases from
zero to 2n  1 or 2n + 1.

(4.31)

21

as deduced from the string picture, the probe does not penetrate the interior
of the enhancon but rather melts into it.

one can extract the moduli space metric from the usual formalism [31, 32].
we leave a more detailed treatment for the future, but in the probe region

 >  it matches the perturbative result

ds2  n ln  u

!dudu .

(4.32)

this agrees with the d3-brane probe result on the supergravity side if we
identify  = e = 37.

5 a tale of two duals

as mentioned in the introduction, there are a number of t - and s- dual

pictures where the same physics arises. (the physics of the heterotic s-dual
for the p = 2 case is essentially contained in the recent work of ref. [34].)

to construct some t -dual cases, consider [13] a pair of ns5-branes which
are pointlike in the (x6, x7, x8, x9) directions, with n d(p+1)-branes stretched
between them along the x6 direction, where p = 0, 1, 2, or 3. the latter are
pointlike in the (xp+1, . . . , x5) directions, which are inside the ns5-branes,
and also in the (x7, x8, x9) directions. all of the branes share the directions
(x0, . . . , xp). this arrangement of branes, shown in gure 2(a) preserves eight
supercharges. we will state the general p case in many of the following for-

mulae. the reader may wish to keep the p = 2 case in mind for orientation.
denoting the separation of the ns5-branes in the x6 direction by l, there
is a (p + 1)-dimensional su(n) gauge theory on the innite part of the
world-volume of the d(p + 1)-branes, whose coupling is

g2
ym = l1g2

p+1 = l1(2)p1g(p2)/2 .

(5.1)

a number of gauge theory facts from the previous sections are manifest
here. for example, the fact that (for p = 2) the coulomb branch of the

22

(a)

(b)

figure 2: n d(p + 1)-branes ending on ns5-branes: (a) the classical picture (b)
the corrected picture, showing the resulting bending of the ns5-branes for large
gn . the separated brane is the probe which becomes massless at the enhancon
locus, an s4p (a circle in the gure).

su(n) gauge theory is dual to the moduli space of n monopoles of a (5+1)-
dimensional gauge theory follows from the fact that the ends of the d3-branes
are membrane monopole sources (in x3, x4, x5) in the ns5-branes world-
volume theory. this is an su(2) gauge theory spontaneously broken to

u(1) by the ns5-branes separation. this will always be the relevant (5+1)-
dimensional theory when (p + 1) is odd because we are in type iib string
theory. when (p + 1) is even, we are in type iia, and the (5+1)-dimensional
theory is the a1 (0,2) theory.

now place the x6 direction on a circle of radius 2. there is a t6-dual of
this arrangement of branes.8 the ns5-branes become an a1 ale space [37].
to see this in supergravity language, we start by smearing the ns5-branes
along the x6 space, writing the supergravity solution for the core of the ns5-

8see refs. [35, 36] for discussions of dualities of this sort.

(5.2)

where y is a 3-vector in the (x7, x8, x9) plane. we have placed one ns5-brane
at y = 0 and the other at y = y0. the condition [39, 38] hmns = 
mns r
denes b6i as a vector i which satises h5 = . applying the usual
supergravity t -duality rules gives:

5 (dx6 + idyi)2 + h5dy  dy , (5.3)
which is the two-centre gibbonshawking metric for the a1 ale space,
nonsingular because of the 2/2 periodicity of x6, and hyperkahler
because of the condition relating h5 and b6i for a supersymmetric vebrane
solution.

there are four moduli associated with this solution, forming a hyper-

multiplet in the (5 + 1)-dimensional theory. three of them constitute the
vector y0 giving the separation between the two centres. the fourth is a

nsns 2-form ux,  = rip1 b2, through the nontrivial two-cycle (a ip1) in

the space. this ip1 is constructed as the locus of x6 circles along the straight
line connecting the two centres y = 0 and y = y0, where they shrink to zero
size; it has area a = 2|y0|. these four numbers specify the separation of
the two ns5-branes in the t6-dual picture.

in our case, we have y0 = 0, and so the branes are only separated in x6,
corresponding to having shrunk the ip1 away. the ux  is kept nite as we
send a to zero, and is the parameter dual to l:

 = 2l .

(5.4)

(the full ns5-branes solution, with dependence on x6, can be recovered in
the duality by considering winding strings in the ale geometry [40], doing

24

a sum over those modes which is dual to a fourier transform of the vebrane
harmonic function on the x6 circle.)

on the ale space, the w -bosons for the enhanced su(2) gauge sym-
metry of the (5 + 1)-dimensional theory are made from a d2- and an anti d2-

brane wrapped on the ip1, their masses being m = 2g1q(2)2y0  y0 + 2,
where the ux appears due to the 2c1b2 coupling; there is some induced
d0-brane charge. under t6-duality, the stretched d(p + 1)-branes become
d(p+2)-branes which are wrapped on the ip1, inducing some dp-brane charge
due to the 2cp+1b2 coupling.

so the conguration with n d(p + 1)-branes stretched between the two
ns5-branes is dual to the same number of d(p + 2)-branes wrapped on the
two-cycle of an a1 ale space, giving rise to n eective dp-branes. the
gauge coupling in the resulting (p + 1)-dimensional su(n) gauge theory is

given by:

g2
ym = 1g(2)p(p1)/2 .

(5.5)

as mentioned in the introduction, this conguration is t -dual to n

d(p + 4) branes wrapped on a k3, of volume v , the parameter dual to
. the things we learned about this original conguration translate into re-

nements of the dual pictures. for example, the nontrivial metric on moduli
space corresponds to the bending [41] of the ns5-branes away from being

at, resulting from the d(p + 1)-branes pull on them (see gure 2(b)). de-
noting the radial coordinate in the (xp+1, . . . , x5) directions as r, (as we did
before), the x6 position of a ns5-brane is given by the equation 2x6(r) = 0,
giving the smooth shape of the ns5-brane for large enough r, i.e. far away
enough from the details of the junction itself.

the solution for the shape is x6(r) =  + nrp3 (p 6= 3), or n log(r/)
(for p = 3), where  and  are constants set by l, the asymptotic separation

of the branes, and g and . using this, an expression for the separation l(r)

25

of the ns5-branes is

2n
l(r) = l 
r3p ;
l(r) = 2n log  r

(p 6= 3) ,
! ;

(p = 3) .

(5.6)

notice that this is precisely the functional behavior that we see in the har-
monic functions for the supergravity solution of the dp-d(p + 4) system. the
parameters  and  can be xed completely by comparing to the large r limit

of probe moduli space computation done there, although we will not do it
here.

in the expression (5.1) for the gauge coupling, we should replace l by our
expression for l(r), giving the running of the coupling with position on the

coulomb branch.

we recover therefore the singularity in the coulomb branch where the

gauge coupling diverges, when the separation l(r) of the ns5-branes is
of order , resulting in an enhanced gauge symmetry on the ns5-branes
(5+1)-dimensional world-volume. the enhancon is simply the s4p of clos-
est approach of the ns5-branes in the x6 direction. notice that the probe
brane we studied previously is a single stretched d(p + 1)-brane moving in
(xp+1, . . . , x5) in this picture.

an r-dependence in the separation between the ns5-branes translates,
using (5.4), into variable w -boson masses m = 2g1(r) in the (5 + 1)-
dimensional theory, giving the enhancon locus where (r) vanishes. using

(r) in the formula (5.5) results in the divergence in the (p + 1)-dimensional
gauge coupling at the enhancon locus.

26

6 conclusions

one notable result of this paper is a new mechanism that resolves a large
class of spacetime singularities in string theory. this involves a phenomenon,

the resolution of a singularity by the expansion of a system of branes in the
transverse directions, which is related to that which has recently arisen in

other forms [42, 43]. one dierence from [42] is that the branes are found not
at the singularity in the supergravity metric; rather, the metric is modied

by string/braney phenomena in the manner that we have described. our
result may point toward a more general understanding of singularities in
string theory.

in the gauge theory we have found a striking parallel between the space-
time picture and the behavior of large-n su(n) gauge theories. the most

interesting open question is to nd a weakly coupled dual to the strongly cou-
pled gauge theory; our results give many hints in this direction. there are

a number of technical loose ends, which include a more complete treatment
of the d3-d7 case, and a fuller understanding of the constraints of super-
symmetry on the probe moduli space. finally, there are many interesting

generalizations, including product gauge groups, the addition of hypermulti-
plets, and rotation.
