(for details orientifolds non-zero b-eld, see, e.g., {$9908064$}11.) sake simplicity consider case square torus metric b-eld given (2). assume b = 1/k, k n {1}. case, start torus small volume, via t-duality transformation map torus large volume. describe t-duality transformation, let us introduce following matrix (here working units 2 = 1, closely following discussion ): eab gab + bab .

twisted open string states come xed point origin 2. thus, using t-duality case map original compactication small volume 2 dual compactication large volume 2-torus. however, situation quite dierent z3 z6 cases. focus z3 case z6 case similar. thus, z3 case twisted open string states arising three xed points 2/z3, possess o-diagonal couplings. original small volume torus compactication unsuppressed, whereas dual large volume torus compactication would exponentially suppressed, would lead puzzle12. resolution point that, originally pointed {$9904211$}, t-duality good symmetry background. particular, broken non-perturbative twisted open string sectors (albeit perturbative (from orientifold viewpoint) open string sectors possess corresponding t-duality symmetry). seen from, say, corresponding explicit z6 examples constructed {$9904211$}. thus, instance, consider non-perturbative orientifold corresponding type k3 = 4/z6, contains d9- d5-branes (the former wrap k3, latter transverse k3 located orientifold point origin k3). perturbative (from orientifold viewpoint) 99 55 open sting sectors identical spectra -
