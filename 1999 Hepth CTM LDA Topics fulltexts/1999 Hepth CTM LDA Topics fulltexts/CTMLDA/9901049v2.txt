abstract

dynamical mass generation of a two-component fermion in qed3 with a chern-
simons term is investigated by solving the schwinger-dyson equation formulated
in the lowest ladder approximation. dependence of the dynamical fermion mass
on a gauge-xing parameter, a gauge coupling constant, and a topological mass is
examined by approximated analytical and also numerical methods. the inclusion of
the chern-simons term makes impossible to choose a peculiar gauge in which a wave
function renormalization is absent. the numerical evaluation shows that the wave
function renormalization is fairly close to 1 in the landau gauge.
it means that
this gauge is still a specic gauge where the ward-takahashi identity is satised
approximately. we also nd that the dynamical mass is almost constant if the
topological mass is larger than the coupling constant, while it decreases when the
topological mass is comparable to or smaller than the coupling constant and tends
to the value in qed3 without the chern-simons term.

i. introduction

in (2+1)-dimensions, generally in odd-dimensional space-time, a peculiar type of quantum

eld theory exists. that is a theory with a chern-simons term in its action. [1, 2] the

chern-simons term may be added to the action by hand or induced in an eective action

by a vacuum polarization eect of a fermion as the anomaly [3]. our understanding on

the theory has been progressed especially through studies of the topological structure due

to the chern-simons term. [4]

on the other hand, two important phenomena were discovered in condensed matter

systems. one is the quantum hall eect [5] and the other is the high-tc superconduc-

tivity [6]. both phenomena may be thought of as realization of macroscopic quantum

eects in planar systems in which electrons have a strong correlation. it is challenging to

ask whether and how the chern-simons term is related to these phenomena discovered in

the two-dimensional electron systems. these situations have activated the study of the

(2+1)-dimensional quantum eld theories.

in (2+1)-dimensional gauge theories, the behaviour in the infrared region seems to be

unstable at least in the perturbative treatment. the chern-simons term gives the gauge

eld a topological mass without breaking gauge symmetry so that the term may rescue

the theory from the infrared catastrophe. this is original motivation of including the

chern-simons term in the action. [7] reminding those studies, we think that one of the

most important problems which is still not clear is what is a role of the chern-simons

term in a nonperturbative region. it is our purpose to clarify how the chern-simons term

aects nonperturbative dynamics.

the dynamical mass generation of the fermion is an important phenomenon induced

by the nonperturbative eects. in even-dimensional space-time, chiral symmetry forbids

the mass of the fermion. the nonperturbative eects can break this symmetry giving the

mass to the fermion. as is well known, we cannot dene the chiral symmetry for the

two-component fermion which belongs to the irreducible spinor representation in (2+1)-

1

dimensions.

instead parity symmetry (p2) forbids the two-component fermion having

the mass. on the other hand, for the f our-component fermion which is composed of

two two-component fermions, we can dene a kind of chiral symmetry. the chiral

transformation is dened by a combination of the parity and z2 avour transformations.
(p4 = p  z2)

many studies on the dynamical mass generation in qed3 have been done already

by using the schwinger-dyson technique [8] or the lattice monte-carlo method [9]. in

almost of previous works, these authors have studied the dynamical mass generation of

the four-component fermions in the theory without the chern-simons term, which is a

spontaneous symmetry breaking of p4 but not p2. these studies have been extended

to the case with the chern-simons term but the fermion considered there has been the

four-component one. [10]

the theory with n four-component fermions is equivalent to the theory with 2n

two-component fermions.

in this sense, the theory with the four-component fermions

can describe only the case with even number of avours (counting the two-component

fermions). it is interesting to ask what happens in the theory with odd number of avours.

this also is another motivation of the present work. the simplest version of the theory

with odd number of avours is the case with a single avour. the rst work concerned with

the dynamical mass generation of the single two-component fermion in qed3 without the

chern-simons term was done in ref.

[11]. the symmetry which was studied in the work

is p2 but not p4. in this paper, we extend the work to the case with the chern-simons

term.

thus we consider the dynamical mass generation of the single two-component fermion

in qed3 with the chern-simons term. the schwinger-dyson equations are formulated

in the lowest ladder approximation, which are two coupled integral equations. due to the

chern-simons term, a drastic change happens in the structure of the schwinger-dyson

equations. while the wave function renormalization is absent in the landau gauge in

qed3 without the chern-simons term [12], the inclusion of the chern-simons term makes

2

impossible to choose a peculiar gauge in which the wave function is not renormalized.

because there are no ad hoc reasons that the landau gauge is specic in qed3 with the

chern-simons term, we should study the coupled integral equations for various values of

the gauge parameter.

our strategy in this work are as follows: first we solve the coupled integral equations in

an approximated analytical method which is very crude but may be available for reference

in a more complete numerical calculation. after that, the coupled integral equations are

solved numerically. in these analyses, we study dependence of the dynamical mass on the

gauge-xing parameter, the coupling constant, and the topological mass.

this paper is organized as follows: in sec. ii, we explain the model which we use.

the schwinger-dyson equations in the lowest ladder approximation are derived in sec.

iii. in sec. iv, the equations are analyzed by the approximated analytical method. the

numerical analysis of the equations are presented in sec. v. we conclude our results with

discussions in sec. vi. in appendices a and b, some useful formulae are summarized.

ii. maxwell-chern-simons qed3

the model which we consider is an extended version of the usual three-dimensional quan-

tum electrodynamics (qed3). it has both of the maxwell and chern-simons terms as the

action of the u(1) gauge eld . we call this theory the maxwell-chern-simons qed3. [7]

the gauge eld is coupled to the two-component dirac fermion. the lagrangian density

of the theory is given by

(1)

the second term in the right-hand side of eq.(1) is the so-called chern-simons term. it

is well-known that the term gives the gauge eld the mass  without breaking the gauge

symmetry.  is called the topological mass because the chern-simons term has topological

meaning as a secondary characteristic class [4, 13].  is the gauge-xing parameter and

e is the gauge coupling constant.  is the two-component fermion eld which belongs to

3

the irreducible spinor representation in (2+1)-dimensions. the dirac matrices are dened
by  0 = 3,  1 = i1,  2 = i2 with diag(g) = (1,1,1) where is (i=1, 2, 3) are the
pauli matrices. the s satisfy relations as {, } = 2g,  = i + g and
tr[] = 2g. in this representation, there does not exist a matrix which anti-commutes

with all of s so that we cannot dene the chiral transformation. this is a specic aspect

of the odd-dimensional space-time.

in even-dimensions, the chiral symmetry requires

that a fermion is massless. in odd-dimensions, the chiral symmetry itself does not exist.

instead, the mass term of the fermion is forbidden by parity symmetry. the parity

transformation is dened as

x = (t, x, y)  x = (t,x, y) ,

(x)   1(x) ,
a0(x)  a0(x) ,
a1(x)  a1(x) ,
a2(x)  a2(x) .

(2)

under the parity transformation, the mass term of the fermion and the chern-simons

term change their signs. thus the mass terms of both the fermion and the gauge eld are

forbidden by the parity symmetry. we study how the breaking of parity by the topological

mass aects the mass generation of the fermion.

iii. schwinger-dyson equations

as a non-perturbative method to evaluate the dynamical mass of the fermion, we use

here the schwinger-dyson technique. the schwinger-dyson equation for the fermion

self-energy (p) is written as

(p) = (ie)2z

d3k
(2)3  is 

f (k) (k, p  k) id

is 

f (p) =

(4)

where a(p) and b(p) are functions of pp in taking into account the relativistic nature,
while (p) depends on ps. a(p)1 is the wave function renormalization and b(p)/a(p)

is a mass induced by dynamical eects at the momentum scale p. the so-called dynamical

mass mphys is dened by mphys = b(0)/a(0) as usual. it is useful to notice the relations

as

tr[(p)] = 2ib(p) ,

tr[6p(p)] = 2i(a(p)  1)p2 .

(5)

to proceed our analysis of eq.(3) further, we need to introduce any suitable approxi-

mation. in this paper, we limit ourselves to use the lowest ladder approximation where the

full propagator of the gauge eld and the full vertex are replaced by the free propagator

and the tree vertex respectively as

id

(p  k)  id(p  k) , (k, p  k)  

.

(6)

the analysis beyond the ladder approximation will appear elsewhere. the free propagator

of the gauge eld is derived from the lagrangian density (1) as

id(p) = i

thus the schwinger-dyson equation in the lowest ladder approximation becomes

(8)

we substitute eqs.(4) and (7) into eq.(8) and use eq.(5) in producing two coupled

equations. after taking the traces, we obtain the coupled integral equations as

now we change the metric to the euclidean one by the wick rotation as (k0, ~k)

p2 = (p0)2  (p1)2. after that, we transform the integral variables ks to the polar
coordinates (k, , ). the angular integration on  and  can be done explicitly. (the

useful integral formulae are listed in appendix a.) finally we obtain the coupled integral

in the successive secs. iv and v, we solve these equations by an approximated analytical

method and also numerically by using an iteration method.

notice that the parameters e2 and  have the dimensions of mass. we may rewrite eqs.
(11) and (12) to dimensionless forms by dening b(x)  b(e2x)/e2 and a(x)  a(e2x)
where x is a dimensionless variable dened by p = e2x. the equations so obtained have a
dimensionless parameter g dened as g  /e2. thus the theory is controlled by only one
parameter. after solving the dimensionless equations for a(x) and b(x), we can convert

them to a(p) and b(p).

if the analytic forms of a(x) and b(x) are known, it is easy

task. however, since our nal results are numerical, the conversion may be tedious for

6

the readers who are informed of the data only by gures. therefore we present our results

in the form with the dimensions in spite of existing redundancy in the presentation.

iv. approximated analytical studies

iv-a.   0 limit

we can check easily that eqs. (11) and (12) reduce to the schwinger-dyson equations in

qed3 without the chern-simons term if we put the topological mass  equal to zero. in
fact, taking the limit as   0 in eqs. (11) and (12), we obtain

which are the schwinger-dyson equations in the lowest ladder approximation derived in

qed3 without the chern-simons term.2 we can see that there exists the specic gauge

where the wave function renormalization is absent. thus in the landau gauge ( = 0),

eq. (14) gives us the simple solution as a(p) = 1 and the problem reduces to solve eq.

(13) with a(p) = 1.

in the case with the chern-simons term, as is seen in eqs. (11) and (12), there does

not exist such a specic gauge where the wave function is not renormalized. as far as

we cannot nd a self-evident reason that the landau is still specic in qed3 with the

chern-simons term, it must be fair to study eqs. (11) and (12) for various values of the

gauge-xing parameter .

iv-b. small p expansion and perturbative results

at rst sight, eqs. (11) and (12) seem to be dangerous in the limit p  0. but we can
check that this limit is well-dened. in the region p  0, eqs.(11) and (12) are written as

(see appendix b.) from eqs. (15) and (16), we can derive the result which is obtained

in the lowest-order of perturbation. by setting a(k) = 1 and b(k) = 0 and performing

the integration on k, we have

where  is the infrared cuto in the integration on k.

it should be noticed that b(0)

depends on only the sign of . this also may be a specic aspect in the (2+1)-dimensions.

the dependence of a(0) on  shows that only the landau gauge is free from the infrared

divergence. on the other hand, a(0) is singular at  = 0 so that the theory with the

chern-simons term may not be smoothly connected to the theory without the chern-

simons term in the lowest-order perturbation.

iv-c. constant approximation

before proceeding to a numerical analysis, it is very useful if we can estimate a(0) and

b(0) analytically even under a fairly crude approximation. the kernels of these integral

equations are dumped rapidly as the integral variable k increases so that the contribution
from k  0 is the most dominant one in the integrals. we approximate a(k) and b(k) by
a(0) and b(0) in the integrals. we call this approximation the constant approximation.

of course this approximation might be too crude for our purpose and we only use the

result as reference in the numerical analysis. under this approximation, we can perform

the remaining radial integration and have the simple algebraic equations as

(20)

(21)

from eqs.(20) and (21), we can see that the dependence of b(0) and a(0) on the

gauge-xing parameter, the coupling constant and the topological mass has the following

peculiar features:

1) dependence on the gauge-xing parameter

b(0) depends linearly on . it is suggestive that a(0) is singular at  = 6 where
b(0) vanishes. in the landau gauge ( = 0), a(0) = 1 and b(0) = e2/2. a(0) = 1

is favourable for us because a(p) = 1 means that the ward-takahashi identity is

satised.

2) dependence on the coupling constant

a(0) does not depend on e2. it means that the deviation of a(0) from 1 is inde-

pendent of the coupling constant. this is crucially dierent from the perturbative

result given by eq.(17) where the deviation is proportional to e2. on the other

hand, b(0) is proportional to e2.

3) dependence on the topological mass

we recognize that eqs.(20) and (21) are independent of the topological mass . in

fact, if we apply the constant approximation to the case without the chern-simons

term, we obtain the same results as eqs. (20) and (21). it means that the amount

of the explicit parity breaking in the gauge sector by the topological mass does not

aect the dynamical mass in the fermion sector.

now we proceed to a more precise numerical evaluation in the next section.

v. numerical analysis

v-a. non-trivial solutions

we solve the two coupled integral equations (11) and (12) numerically by using a method

of iteration. first we substitute trial functions into a(k) and b(k) in the right-hand

sides of eqs. (11) and (12) and then calculate the integrals numerically. the outputs so

obtained, a(p) and b(p), are substituted back to the right-hand sides until the outputs

coincide with the inputs. finally we obtain convergent functions a(p) and b(p), which

satises the integral equations, if there exist any solutions in eqs. (11) and (12).

we obtain the non-trivial solutions for the various values of the gauge parameter .

for e = 1.0 and  = 1.0, a(p)s in the cases of  = 0, 1, 2, 3 are shown in fig. 1. the

corresponding b(p)s are presented in fig. 2. we nd a very interesting feature that a(p)

is fairly close to 1 in the landau gauge ( = 0).

in the case of qed3 without the chern-simons term, a(p) is exactly equal to 1 in

the landau gauge under the lowest ladder approximation. [11] however, in the case of

qed3 with the chern-simons, there may be no apparent reason that a(p) = 1 in the

landau gauge. our numerical calculation shows that the landau gauge is still a good
gauge giving a(p)  1. in a sense, it is surprising that the numerical calculation of so
complicated integral equations results a(p)  1 in the landau gauge. there might be a
simple reason of explaining a peculiarity of the landau gauge.

v-b. dependence on the gauge parameter

the dependence of a(0) and b(0) on the gauge-xing parameter  is shown in figs. 3

and 4. in the region  > 0, the numerical result is consistent with the one obtained in

the constant approximation.

on the other hand, in the region  < 0, there appears a very strange behaviour in the

numerical evaluation. in fig. 3 and 4, we can see that some dierent points are plotted

for a xed (< 0). it means that a(0) and b(0) oscillate in the iterations taking these

10

values in order. these points do not correspond to solutions. as an example, a(p) and
b(p) at  = 10 are shown in fig. 5 and 6. it is very resemble to the quasi-periodic
signal which appears in a chaotic non-linear system. it might be interesting to proceed a

study in this direction from a mathematical point of view.

in figs. 7 and 8, we have shown the -dependence of the dynamical mass mphys =

b(0)/a(0) in dierent regions of . mphys is the physical quantity so that it should be

gauge invariant. these gures show that the -dependence may weaken fairly, compared

with the result in the constant approximation. in addition, we can nd another interesting
aspect. in figs. 3 and 4, each of a(0) and b(0) at  = 1 oscillates in taking 6 values
in order. it is surprising that the corresponding values of b(0)/a(0) reduce to two values

of mphys as seen in figs. 7 and 8. as a whole, there is one solution in the region of  > 0

and the 2-periodic signal in the region of  < 0 in seeing mphys.

the results obtained in secs.v-a and v-b suggest that the landau gauge is still the

best gauge. hereafter we present mainly the results obtained in the landau gauge.

v-c. dependence on the coupling constant

in fig. 9 we show the dependence of a(0) on the coupling constant e. the series of figs.

10, 11 and 12 show the e2-dependence of b(0) in the dierent scales of e2. we can see that

the deviation of a(0) from 1 is less than 1 %. we may say that a(0) is almost equal to 1

in all region of the coupling constant. on the other hand, b(0) increases as the coupling

constant becomes larger. the e2-dependence of b(0) is almost linear when e2 is smaller

than . this is consistent with the constant approximation. but the slope is smaller than

the one obtained in the constant approximation and the line curves downward slightly as

the coupling constant becomes larger, which may be a non-perturbative eect.

v-d. dependence on the topological mass

what we are most interested in is the dependence of the dynamical mass of the fermion

on the topological mass of the gauge eld. in the constant approximation, it has been

11

shown that both a(0) and b(0) do not depend on the topological mass. is this true in

the more precise numerical evaluation?

in fig. 13, it can be seen that the -dependence of a(0) is extremely weak. the

deviation from a(0) = 1 is very small. on the other hand, the -dependence of b(0) (or

b(0)/a(0)) is shown in fig.14. though b(0) (or b(0)/a(0)) is almost constant in the

region of  > e2, it decreases as  does if  is comparable to or smaller than e2.

it should be noticed that for very small or large values of the topological mass com-

pared with the coupling constant, there appears a technical diculty in the numerical

calculation as follows: in principle, we do not need to cut o the region of the energy-

momentum integrals in eqs.

(11) and (12). but in the practical prescription of the

numerical integration, the innite range of the integration must be replaced by a nite

one so that it is not avoidable to introduce cut-o parameters. the cut-o dependence of

the results must be checked carefully. when the topological mass  takes very small or

large values compared with e2, it has been found that the integration region must be taken

wider enough to get reliable results. it needs much machine power. in getting our results,

we have checked the absence of the cut-o dependence in detail in the parameter region
adopted here (/e2 = 102  104). therefore we conclude that the behaviour of a(0)
and b(0) mentioned above, especially the decreasing of b(0) in the region of /e2 < 1, is

not due to the cut-o.

vi. conclusion and discussion

we have investigated the dynamical mass generation of the single two-component fermion

and b(p), where the full fermion propagator is dened by s 

in qed3 with the chern-simons term. the coupled schwinger-dyson equations for a(p)
f (p)1 = a(p) 6p b(p), have
been formulated in the lowest ladder approximation. when the chern-simons term is

included, there does not exist the specic gauge where a(p) is automatically equal to 1 as

the case without the chern-simons term. we examine the dependence of the dynamical

mass on the gauge-xing parameter , the coupling constant e and the topological mass

12

 by using the approximated analytical and also the numerical methods. @

the coupled integral equations have been solved rst analytically in the constant

approximation where a(p) and b(p) have been replaced by a(0) and b(0) respectively.

we have found that b(0) is proportional to  and also to e2. on the other hand, a(0) is
independent of e and singular at  = 6 where b(0) vanishes. we also have found that
a(0) and b(0) do not depend on the topological mass.

keeping these facts in mind we have proceeded to solve the set of the integral equations

by using the numerical method. the dependence of a(0) and b(0) on  and e are almost

consistent with the results derived in the constant approximation. b(0) depends on 

linearly. the e2-dependence of b(0) also is almost linear but the value of the slope becomes

smaller than the one in the constant approximation as e2 increases. the e-dependence of

a(0) is almost absent.

further we have discovered some novel features in the numerical analysis. first we
have found a(p)  1 at  = 0 so that the landau gauge is still a good gauge where
it is not entirely obvious why
the ward-takahashi identity is satised approximately.

the numerical evaluation of so complicated integral equations results that a(0) is almost

equal to 1 at  = 0. we may expect that there is any simple reason.

secondly we have found the strange behaviour of a(0) and b(0) in the region  < 0.

there has appeared the quasi-periodic signal in the iterations. the signal is a popular

phenomena in a non-linear system. we wonder that the signal appeared here would have

any physical or mathematical meaning or not.

as the third, it seems that the dynamical mass of the fermion is almost constant if  is

larger than e2, while it decreases when  is comparable to or smaller than e2. why it is?
in the case of  6= 0, we have found just one solution in our numerical analysis. on the
other hand, we know that there exist two solutions in the case of  = 0 [11]; one is trivial
(b = 0) and the other one nontrivial (b 6= 0). we have extrapolated our numerical data
b(0)/a(0) to  = 0 by using the method of least squares [14] and obtained fig. 15. the

numerical evaluations in qed3 without the chern-simons term results b(0) = 0.104755

13

( = 0 and a(0) = 1). the value obtained by the extrapolation is b(0)/a(0) = 0.105255

so that both results may be consistent with each other. thus, the solution in the case
of  6= 0 seems to approach the non-trivial one as   0. of course, we should be
careful before accepting this result. as mentioned in v-d, the numerical evaluation in

the region of /e2 << 1 is very dicult technically and the behaviour of the solution in
taking the limit   0 is still not clear. there might appear any critical behaviour such
as a bifurcation of the solution. the best way to conrm the result is to give a proof

by analytical method but it is very dicult because the integral equations are highly

non-linear. we are now extending the parameter region to search any more non-trivial

structure especially in the region of /e2 << 1. the result will be reported separately.

appendix a: angular integration

we present here the formulae for the angular integration, which are used to derive eqs.(11)

and (12) in sec. iii. after the wick rotation, eqs. (9) and (10) can be rewritten in the

polar coordinates as

b(p) =

appendix b: p  0 limit and constant approximation
the formulae which are used in sec. iv are summarized here. the (p  0) limit is taken
by the expansion formulae as

in the constant approximation of eqs. (11) and (12), we replace the unknown functions

a(k) and b(k) to a(0) and b(0). setting p = 0, we obtain

b(0) =

[12] in this context, we are concerned with the renormalization of the ultraviolet diver-

gence (qed3 is super-renormalizable. ). it also should be noticed that there exists

a specic renormalization of a infrared divergence in a normal phase (no mass gen-

eration) of qed3. see i.j.r. aitchison, n.e. mavromatos, and d. mc neill, phys.
