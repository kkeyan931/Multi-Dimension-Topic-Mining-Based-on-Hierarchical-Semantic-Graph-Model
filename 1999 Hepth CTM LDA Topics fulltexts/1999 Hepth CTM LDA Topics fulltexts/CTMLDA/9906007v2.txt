abstract

four dierent types of free energies are computed by both thermodynamical bethe
ansatz (tba) techniques and by weak coupling perturbation theory in an integrable
one-parameter deformation of the o(4) principal chiral -model (with su(2)u(1)
symmetry). the model exhibits both fermionic and bosonic type free energies
and in all cases the perturbative and the tba results are in perfect agreement,
strongly supporting the correctness of the proposed s matrix. the mass gap is also
computed in terms of the  parameters of the modied minimal substraction scheme
and a lattice regularized version of the model.

1. introduction

we shall study the following one-parameter family of 1+1 dimensional -models

described by the lagrangian

l0 = 

1

 + l2

2(cid:16)l1
l1
a = g1g ,

la

where

1

l2

 + (1 + g)l3

(cid:17) ,

g  su(2) ,

g is a (real) parameter and a stand for the standard pauli matrices. the lagrangian
(1.1) can be interpreted as a deformation of the su(2)su(2) (or o(4)) symmetric
nonlinear -model (nls) by the parameter g. it possesses an su(2)lu(1)r (global)
symmetry. we shall assume in the following that the deformation parameter, g,
satises

(1.1)

(1.2)

(1.3)

 1  g  0 ,

because with g being in this range the model, (1.1), is asymptotically free (af) (see
appendix d). at the classical level the deformed model, (1.1), interpolates between
the su(2)su(2) (g = 0) and o(3) (g = 1) nls models. it has already appeared
in the bethe ansatz approach of polyakov and wiegmann to solve the su(2)su(2)
and o(3) nls [1, 2]. the deformed model (1.1) is known to possess a lax-pair and
is believed to be integrable both at the classical and at the quantum level [3]. its s
matrix has been proposed long time ago [1, 2] and at present a considerable amount
of evidence corroborates the belief that the deformed su(2)u(1) symmetric -
model is quantum integrable indeed [4, 5, 6]. its spectrum is thought to contain
two massive doublets whose scattering is described by the tensor product of an
su(2)u(1) symmetric solution of the bootstrap s-matrix equations:

s() = s()()  s(p)() ,

(1.4)

where s(p)() is the sine-gordon (sg) s-matrix depending on the parameter p. in
eq. (1.4) the limit p   corresponds to an su(2)su(2) symmetric s-matrix.

in this paper we carry out a rather thorough consistency check on the proposed
s-matrix of the one parametric deformation of the o(4) -model, (1.1). the basic
idea is to investigate the system at large particle density when both perturbation
theory in the coupling  and a calculation based on the smatrix of the massive
physical particles apply. (for a review, see ref. [7].) to achieve this one introduces
a chemical potential, h, coupled to a noether charge of the corresponding symmetry,
and considers the ground state of the modied hamiltonian

the legendre transform of the ground state energy density or (zero temperature)
free energy of the system must be the form:

h = h0  hq .

(1.5)

f  f (h)  f (h)  f (0) = h2f0(h/m, q) ,

(1.6)

1

where m is the mass of the particles. (eq. (1.6) follows simply from dimensional
analysis.) the thermodynamical bethe ansatz (tba) method based on the s
matrix leads to a set of integral equations, which can be solved, for large chemical
potential h, in the form of an asymptotic series expansion in h/m using a modied
wiener-hopf technique [8].

on the other hand in an asymptotically free theory the result of a perturbative
computation of f0 (which is of course renormalization group invariant) is an asymp-
totic series in the running coupling, (h/)  [ln(h/)]1, where the  parameter
(of dimension mass) is the usual renormalization group invariant combination of the
ultraviolet cuto and the bare coupling, .

since f is a physical quantity, the results obtained by tba method and by
perturbation theory should agree. thus comparison of the two results provides a
rather stringent consistency check on the s-matrix (and also on the self-consistency
of the hypothesis used in the course of the calculation), moreover one can also
extract the exact m/ ratio, a rather important non-perturbative parameter of the
theory which can then be also measured e.g. by lattice simulations. this comparison,
following the pioneering work in refs. [9, 10], has since been applied to many bosonic,
fermionic and supersymmetric integrable models.

in ref. [6] a two-parameter family of integrable models has been studied by
similar techniques. the models were mainly treated as perturbed conformal eld
theories allowing for a proof of integrability at the quantum level. the su(2)u(1)
symmetric s-matrix (1.4) is a limiting case, (p1  , p2 = p), of the s-matrix
of ref. [6].
in the present paper, however, we put the emphasis on the -model
representation suitable for traditional weak-coupling perturbation theory. although
the model (1.1) corresponds to a limiting case of the two-parameter family of ref. [6],
one cannot read o directly the asymptotic expansions for the ground state energies
from ref. [6]. this is due to the fact that both in perturbation theory and using
the tba only the asymptotic series are computable. the coecients of these series
diverge in the p1   limit, thus one cannot directly recover the coecients of the
limiting case from those valid for nite values of the parameters. for this reason we
had to perform the tba analysis directly in the p   limit.

as there are two conserved noether charges in the model (1.1), ql, qr, there
are three types of free energies corresponding to ground states either coupled to
ql or to qr or to both of them. in fact when the ground state is coupled to ql,
one has to distinguish between two dierent cases namely p > 1 and p < 1 as
then bound states (breathers) appear in the spectrum. we have calculated all the
(four) dierent types of (zero temperature) free energies both by the tba method
and by perturbation theory in the modied minimal substraction scheme (ms) and
extracted the corresponding (four) m/ ratios. three of the kernels of the integral
equation determining the ground state energies are simply the p1   limits of
the corresponding ones in [6] whereas in the p < 1 case with bound states we have

2

computed the corresponding kernel directly using the bootstrap fusion method. we
have found complete consistency for all four cases, in particular all of the four m/
ratios agree, the result being:

m
ms

= 23 p

2 e

p

21 (1 + p
2 )
p

,

(1.7)

where m is the mass of the su(2) doublets. the p  0 limit (corresponding to the
running deformation parameter g(h)  1 in (1.1) is expected to give the o(3)
nls model (and a decoupled free eld) [2]. our results are in perfect agreement
with his expectation, as the previously calculated m1/ms = 8/e ratio in the o(3)
nls model [9] (where now m1 denotes the mass of the triplet in the o(3) model) is
reproduced in the p  0 limit. this can be immediately seen from eq. (1.7) using
the fact that in the p  0 limit m1  pm.

we have also proposed a lattice action for the deformed o(4) nls model and
calculated the ratio of the -parameters corresponding to the two regularization
schemes:

= 32e

ms
l

(1.8)

the plan of the paper is as follows:

in section 2 the calculation of the free
energies by the tba method is outlined, in section 3 the perturbative computation
is presented in some detail and the m/ ratios are also given there. section 4 is
devoted to the perturbative calculation of the free energy using lattice regularization
leading to the ms/l ratio. to make the paper rather self contained we included
four appendices with some details of the computations. appendix a contains some
useful formulae to obtain the free energy by solving the pertinent integral equation.
in appendix b the scattering phase shift of the lowest mass bound state is calculated.
appendix c contains some details of the perturbative calculations, while appendix
d is devoted to renormalization group considerations.

2. calculation of the free energies from the integral equation

as the model (1.1) admits g = su(2)lu(1)r as its (global) symmetry group,
one can introduce two chemical potentials coupled to the two noether charges,
ql, qr, corresponding to the two u(1) (l and r) subgroups of g. the modied
hamiltonian then reads

(2.1)
for deniteness we chose hl, hr  0 and normalize the charges of the four particles
as
(2.2)

h = h0  hlql  hrqr .

(1, 1) ,

(1, 1) ,

(1,1)

(1,1) .

we distinguish between the three dierent types of nite density ground states
depending on hl, hr:

3

1. hl , hr > 0 ,

(diag)

2. hl = 0 , hr = h > 0 , (right)

3. hl = h > 0 , hr = 0 . (left)

in the following we shall analyse these three cases.

2.1 the diagonal current

we recall that our strategy will be to calculate the ground state energy density
of the system at large particle density (and at zero temperature), that is we consider
the system with hl/m, hr/m  1 (m is the mass of the particles). then it is clear
that particles of charge (1,1) condense into the vacuum. it is less clear what other
kind of particles (necessarily with a smaller charge/mass ratio) will appear in the
vacuum state. we shall assume that the vacuum consist of only particles of charge
(1,1). this seemingly radical assumption has apparently worked in all analogous
examples studied so far, and it greatly simplies the solution of tba equations.

the scattering phase of the (1,1) type particle, (), can be read o from eq.

(b.11) in appendix b:

() = () + p() .

(2.3)

when the ground state is assumed to contain only particles of charge (1,1) the
calculation of the free energy using the tba method reduces to the solution of
a single integral equation (a.1) where the kernel k is given by the logarithmic
derivative of the relevant s-matrix element,

k() =

1
2i

d
d

ln s() .

(2.4)

in the present case s() = exp {i()} where scattering phase, (), is given by
eq. (2.3). we note that the eective chemical potential, h, in eq. (a.1) is just
h = hl + hr. from eqs. (2.3, b.8) the fourier transform of the relevant kernel is
easily found to be:

1  kd() =

tanh 
2
2 sinh p
2

p||

2

e

,

(2.5)

with p > 0. the result of the splitting of 1  kd() = [g+()g()]1 where
g+() resp. g() are analytic functions in the upper resp. lower half plane can be
written as

g+() = q2p

2(1  i
2 )

(1  i)(1  ip
2 )

e

and g() = g+().

4

ip

2 (1ln( ip

(2.6)

for the present (fermionic type) kernel (2.5) the constants in eqs. (a.5-a.6) of

appendix a are given as

a =  p

k = 2p ,

b =

g+(i) =

then the expression for free energy (a.5) nally reads:

fd(h) =

a

(2.7)

(2.8)

where t = ln(h/m) and the constant a, which enters in our nal result for the m/
ratio is given as

a =

p

) +

p

(

3

2  ln 2)  1 + 3 ln 2  ln (cid:21) .

(2.9)

we remark here that from the classical term in eq. (2.8), h2p/, one can imme-
diately read o the level of an underlying ultraviolet (uv) current algebra, k, as
k = p [11].

2.2 the right current

in analogy to the assumption made in the diagonal case we now expect the
ground state to consist of a mixture of particles of the same charge with respect
to u(1)r, i.e. those of charge (1,1) and (-1,1) with equal densities. in ref. [6] the
result of the diagonalisation of the pertinent coupled tba system has been given
and the relevant kernel, kr() turns out to be the p1   limit in eq. (57) of
ref. [6]. from this one nds (somewhat surprisingly) kr() = kd(), implying
that fr(h) = fd(h), where we have denoted the chemical potential for the right
current as hr = h. so the free energies are precisely the same as functions of the
eective chemical potentials in these two apparently rather dierent cases. we do
not have an explanation of this fact, we note, however, that as long as p1 < 
kr() 6= kd().
2.3 the left current

analogously to the right case the ground state is expected to consist of an
equal density mixture of particles of the same charge, this time with respect to
u(1)l, i.e. those of charge (1,1) and (1,-1). using again the result of ref. [6] the
fourier transform of the relevant (bosonic type) kernel is found to be:

1  kl() =

tanh ||
2
2 cosh x
2

x||

2

e

,

(2.10)

5

where x = p  1 and x is assumed to be positive. the functions appearing in the
decomposition of 1  kl() are now given as
(1  i
2 )
2 )( 1
2  i
2 )

2
i

2 (1ln( ix

2  ix

g+() =

(2.11)

2 )) ,

ix

e

( 1

and g() = g+(). for the kernel (2.10) the constants in eq. (a.8) are not
dicult to calculate and we nd:

a =  x
2 ,
k = 2 ,

1
b = 
2
g+(i) =

[x ln x + x(ln 2  1  (1)) + 2 ln 2] ,


( 1+x
2 )

e x

2 (1ln x

2 ) .

so the asymptotic series of the free energy density can be simply written as

fl(h) = 

h2

 (cid:18)t + (1 

p
2

) ln t + a + . . .(cid:19) ,

(2.12)

(2.13)

where the constant a, which enters to our nal result for the ratio m/ is found to
be

a =

5
2

ln 2  ln   1 + ln (cid:18)1 + x

2 (cid:19) +

x
2

(1  ln 2) .

(2.14)

at this point we would like to remark that although the p   limit in the
s-matrix is smooth (c.f. eq. (b.8)) this is not the case in the nal results for the
free energy, i.e. in eqs. (2.8), (2.13). this is not so surprising since eqs. (2.8), (2.13)
have been obtained as asymptotic expansions valid for h/m   for xed p, and
the lack of a smooth p   limit of the coecients shows that the h/m   and
the p   limits cannot be simply interchanged in these asymptotic expansions.
next it might be worth pointing out the following (somewhat puzzling) fact. in
eq. (2.8) the ratio of the coecients of the ln t/t2 term, p2/4, and the 1/t term,
p/2, is rd = p/2, while in eq. (2.13) the ratio of the coecients of the ln t term,
1 p/2, and that of the t term is rl = 1 p/2. this appears to be a serious problem
since on general grounds in a theory with a coupling, , the perturbative result for
a fermionic type free energy is expected to be of the form

ffer(h) = 

h2f0

  1  f1

(h)
2

+ o(2)! ,

while in the same theory for a bosonic case it is expected to be given by

fbos(h) = 

h2b0

   1
(h)

+ const. + o()! ,

(2.15)

(2.16)

where f0, f1, b0 are constants and (h) is the running coupling. since from the
renormalization group

(h)

h

+ o(

h/

) ,

(2.17)

one would expect rfer = rbos = 1/2
0. as in the present case rd 6= rl, it seems
impossible to match eq. (2.8) and eq. (2.13) simultaneously with the corresponding
perturbative expansion. fortunately this turns out to be only an apparent paradox
which is resolved, however, in a not entirely obvious way (see section 3).

finally we note that the leading term of fl(h)/h2 diverges as ln(h/m) which
can be interpreted that either the underlying uv current algebra does not exist or
that if it could be dened its level is divergent.

2.4 the left current for p < 1

in the previous subsection it has been assumed that the parameter, x = p1 > 0.
although in the s-matrix any p  0 is allowed in eq. (2.10) the range of p is,
however, restricted to p > 1. this restriction follows from the fact that in eq. (2.10)
kl() = 1 for 0  p < 1, that is for p < 1 kl() ceases to be the fourier
lim
transform of a function. then clearly one cannot just simply analytically continue
in p the result for the free energy, (2.13), for p < 1.

in order to clarify what happens when p becomes smaller than one, we recall
that then in the sine-gordon (sg) theory bound states (breathers) appear in the
spectrum (for p < 1 one enters simply the attractive regime). the sg mass spectrum
is given by the well known formula:

mr = 2m sin

pr

2

,

r = 1, 2 . . . <

1
p

,

(2.18)

where m denotes the mass of the sg kinks. as the s matrix of the present model, eq.
(1.4), contains the sg s matrix as a factor the spectrum then changes accordingly,
i.e. breathers also appear (with apropriate multiplicity) in the deformed nls model.
(we remark that m is also the mass of the su(2) doublets, of course).

the appearence of these new particles implies that as soon as p becomes smaller
than 1, the vacuum changes as then it becomes energetically favourable for the r = 1
charge (2,0) breather to condense. this charge (2,0) breather can be interpreted as
the bound state of the (1,1) and (1,-1) particles (kinks).
in fact as this particle
has the highest charge/mass ratio, we can again assume (as in subsection 2.1) that
the true vacuum consists only of the condensate of the r = 1 charge (2,0) breather.
then one needs the scattering phase, (2,0)(), of the (2,0) breathers in order to
compute fl(h) for the p < 1 case.

the calculation of (2,0)() amounts to a simple application of the well known
bootstrap-fusion method [13].
in appendix b we summarized this method and
calculated the breather-breather phase shift, which is given by eq. (b.16). using
eq. (b.18) the fourier transform of the pertinent kernel is found to be

1  kb() = 2 tanh

||
2

cosh

|x|

2

e |||x|

2

,

(2.19)

7

where |x| = |p  1| = 1  p. the functions appearing in the decomposition of
1  kb() are now given as
1


2 (1ln( i|x|

g+() =

2  i|x|
2 )( 1
(1  i
2 )
( 1
2  i
2 )

i

(2.20)

1

e i|x|

2

)) ,

and again g() = g+().

for the kernel (2.19) the constants in (a.8) are found to be:

a = |x|
2 ,

k = 1 ,

b =

1
2

[|x| ln|x| + |x|(ln 2  1  (1))  2 ln 2] ,

g+(i) =

1
2

 1 + |x|

2 ! e

|x|

2 (1ln |x|

2 ) .

(2.21)

so the nal result for the asymptotic expansion of the free energy density for the
r = 1 charge (2,0) breather condensate can be written as

fb(hb) = 

h2
b

4 (cid:18) + (1 

p
2

) ln  + ab + . . .(cid:19) ,

where  = ln hb/m1 and the constant ab is given as

ab = 3 ln 2 

3

2  ln  + ln (cid:18)p

2(cid:19) +

p
2

(1  ln 2) + ln(cid:18)sin

p

2 (cid:19) .

(2.22)

(2.23)

it is now easy to verify that expressing the breather mass, m1, through the kink
mass, m, using the sg spectrum formula eq. (2.18) and taking into account that
the charge of the breather is twice that of the kink, i.e. hb = 2h, the free energy
density of the breather condensate, fb(hb, m1), becomes identical to that of the
charge (1,1) kink mixture, fl(h, m) analytically continued for negative values of
x. this is very reassuring as the result for fl(h, ) from perturbation theory turns
out to be continuous for the full range 0  p < , which is certainly to be expected.
2.5 the o(3) model as the p  0 limit.

in this last subsection we discuss the p  0 limit and recapitulate some argu-
ments advanced a long time ago by wiegmann [2] that the su(2)lu(1)r invariant
theory (1.1) in this limit becomes equivalent to the o(3) -model and a decoupled
free massive particle. first of all from eq. (2.18) one sees that m/m1   as p  0
i.e. the kinks disappear from the spectrum. furthermore the higher breathers with
r > 1 also disappear from the spectrum, but for a dierent reason. the bind-
ing energy of the r > 1 breathers (which can be considered as bound states of the
r = 1 ones) tends to zero giving rise to zero energy bound states. therefore the
limiting spectrum consists of 4 massive particles, transforming as (3l +1l, 1r) under
su(2)lu(1)r. as already claimed in ref. [2] and conrmed in ref. [5] in the p  0
limit the s-matrix of these remaining r = 1 kinks becomes eectively so(3)  1 i.e.

8

the tensor product of the (minimal) s matrix of the o(3) model proposed by the
zamolodchikov brothers [17] with the s-matrix of a free boson, consistently with
this somewhat heuristic argument. as this is a highly non-trivial limit it is clearly
desirable to perform as many quantitative checks on it as possible. in the following
we add yet another piece of evidence corroborating the arguments of wiegmann,
by showing that the p  0 limit of the m1/ms ratio agrees precisely with the one
calculated directly in the o(3) model [9].

3. perturbative calculations

in this section we calculate the ground state energy of the system in the pres-
ence of external elds in perturbation theory. as in the previous section, we shall
consider elds coupled to the noether charges corresponding to the u(1)lu(1)r
transformation
(3.1)

g = il3g  irg3 .

to calculate the ground state energy one has to gauge the symmetries in the eu-
clidean eld theory formulation and consider the case of constant, imaginary gauge
elds [9]. the corresponding covariant derivative d is given by

d2g = 2g + hl3g  hrg3 ,

d1g = 1g .

(3.2)

putting (3.2) into (1.1) we write the gauged lagrangian as:

l = l0 + l1 + l2 ,

(3.3)

where l1 and l2 denote the terms linear and quadratic in the external elds, re-
spectively.

to actually calculate the free energy in the presence of the external eld, we take

the master formula

where

f (h) = f (h) = f (h)  f (0) ,

(3.4)

(3.5)

er dnx f (h) = z dg expn z dnx (l0 + l1 + l2)o ,

and expand it in powers of the (bare) coupling 0. from now on the bare lagrangian
parameters (couplings) will be denoted as 0 and g0. we have also written the
volume element as dnx, where n = 2   to indicate that we are going to use
dimensional regularization in the perturbative calculations.

in perturbation theory the action has to be expanded around a (stable) solution
of the classical equations of motion. thus our next task is to nd elements of
su(2), g0, that correspond to (local) minima of the quadratic part of the gauged
lagrangian,

l2 =

(3.6)

where

z =

2

trn3g13go ,

(3.7)

which plays the role of the potential energy.
following two solutions. the rst one, called bosonic, (bos) is given as:

in this paper we shall consider the

g0 =

1
2

(1 + i2) ,

hr = 0 .

the other one, which shall be referred to as fermionic (fer) is written as

g0 = i2 ,

where we also require that hl and hr satisfy the inequality

 = 4[h2

lg0 + hlhr(1 + g0)]  0 ,

ensuring the non-negativity of the mass term.

(3.8)

(3.9)

(3.10)

the terms bosonic (resp. fermionic) are used here by anticipating that they
actually correspond to the bosonic (resp. fermionic) type free energies discussed in
the previous section. the bos-type solution will be used to calculate the free energy
corresponding to the pure u(1)l charge (hr = 0, left) case, while the fer-type
solution is appropriate to calculate the free energy for both the pure u(1)r charge
(hl = 0, right) and the diagonal (diag) case, where both hl and hr are
dierent from zero.

we now start to analyse the bos case rst. the leading, o(1

0 ), term in
perturbation theory is given by the potential energy, l2, at its minimum, which is
immediately seen to be (z0 = 0, hr = 0)

f (1) = l(1) = 

2h2
l
0

.

(3.11)

then we turn to the calculation of the next, 1-loop, term in perturbation theory.
the calculation is elementary but for completeness we give some details in appendix
c. the general 1-loop contribution is given by eq. (c.15), which is a rather compli-
cated function of three parameters. it simplies somewhat in the two cases we are
interested in. in the present, bos, case after using (c.12), we obtain

because of the explicit dependence of the integrand on the second component of the
momentum we have to modify the usual rules of dimensional regularization by the
following. in all feynman integrals we perform the one-dimensional integral over

continued to n  1 dimensions, i.e. in the present paper

it is possible to calculate the integral (3.12) exactly [16]. for our purposes, however,
it is sucient to calculate its divergent part (the part that becomes singular in the
  0 limit) and to show that f (0) must be of the form
+ w (g0)) ,

l( 1  g0

f (0) = hn

(3.14)

where w (g0) is a (complicated) nite function of its argument. fortunately all we
shall need is the value of w (g0) at the special point g0 = 1. for this very special
g0 (3.12) simplies enormously:

f (0)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)g0=1

calculating (3.15) and comparing the result to (3.14) yields

w (1) =

[1 + (1) + ln ] .

(3.15)

(3.16)

having obtained the bare 1-loop result, we now turn to renormalization and renor-
malization group (rg) improvements. the methods are well-known but we sum-
marized the details of the calculation in appendix d to make this paper relatively
self-contained.

the rg improved perturbative result gives the asymptotic expansion of the
free energy for large values of the external elds. writing the sum of the classical
contribution (3.11) and the one-loop correction (3.14) and using denitions (d.2),
(d.3) we obtain the renormalized form

f (h) = 

2h2
 

(1  g)h2

4

ln

h2
2 + h2w (g) + o() ,

(3.17)

where h = hl. expressing the result in terms of the single eective coupling, e,
dened by eq. (d.29) we get

f (h) = 2h2( 1

e

+

1

2(cid:16) ln 2 

1

2(cid:17) +   ) .

(3.18)

at this point we remark that we have identied the rg invariant parameter dened
in terms of the running couplings g(t) and (t) by eq. (d.21) with the deformation

11

parameter p appearing in the s matrix (1.4). finally expanding (3.18) with the
help of (d.32) the free energy in the bos case can be expressed as

f (h) = 

h2

 (s +(cid:16)1 

p

2(cid:17) ln s +(cid:16) ln 2 

1

2(cid:17) +   ) .

(3.19)

next we turn to the computation in the fer case. the leading (classical) term

of the free energy is then

f (1) = l(1) = 

2(1 + g0)

0

(hl + hr)2 .

(3.20)

note that f (1) for the diagonal charge depends only on the sum hl + hr. this is
consistent with the results of the tba analysis found in section 2. for the diag
case. in the present (fer) case (c.15) becomes

where

f (0) =

2

n z

dnp
(2)n re

  ip2

p2 +   2ip2

,

 = hl(1  g0)  hr(1 + g0) .

(3.21)

(3.22)

evaluating eq. (3.21) using the modied dimensional scheme (c.f. (3.13)) yields:

f (0) = (1 + g0)n (hl + hr)n( 1

2

+

1

4h1 + (1) + ln 4i) .

(3.23)

it is gratifying to nd that the one loop term (3.23) also depends only on the sum
hl + hr, just like the classical one (3.20). this is not an accident.
it is in fact
absolutely essential that f (hl, hr) be a function of hl + hr in order to be able to
match the perturbative result with the one found by the tba method for the diag
case in subsection 2.1. as shown in appendix c, in the fer case the free energy
does depend only on the sum hl + hr to all orders in perturbation theory. moreover
it is easy to see that the free energy in the fer case must be of the form

f (h) = 

2h2(1 + g0)

0

where

m = (1 + g0) (hl + hr) ,

(3.24)

(3.25)

(3.26)

and the summation is over the number of loops, l. (3.24) is nothing but dimensional
analysis based on the fact that the only dimensionful parameter available is m, which
serves as an infrared cuto in our perturbative computations. the second form

12

(3.25) illustrates the fact that all higher order terms are proportional to (1 + g0)2,
which fact plays an important role in our calculations.

adding now the classical and the one-loop terms, (3.20) and (3.23) and expressing

the result in terms of renormalized quantities we obtain:

f (h) = 2h2( 1 + g

(1 + g)2

(3.27)

where h = hl + hr and the constant  is dened as
2 (1) + ln4 .

 = 1

(3.28)

as we need the expansion of f (h) up to o(2
e) in the eective coupling in this case,
in fact we obtain
this would necessitate a three-loop computation at rst sight.
all the o(2
e) terms from the one loop result (3.27) alone! this mini miracle is
due to the (1 + g)2 factor in front of the one-loop term together with the fact that
(1 + g)2 = o(2
e). moreover as
it follows from eq. (3.25) the contribution of the higher order terms will be at least
o(3
e) hence they can be safely ignored. putting then everything together we nd

e), implying that the one-loop term is already o(2

(3.29)

note the non-analytic contribution, ln e, in the last term of (3.29). this comes
ultimately from the g0-dependence in (3.26) of m, which plays the role of the infrared
cuto in our calculations. the presence of this non-analytic term in e explains
why the coecient of the ln s term diers for the bos and the fer cases. indeed
using eq. (d.32) we nd that the large s expansion in the fer case is nally given
as

f (h) =

having calculated the asymptotic form of the free energy both in perturbation
theory and with the tba method, by comparing them (with t = s  ln(m/ms))
we obtain the relation between the mass of the doublet particles, m, and ms. in
both the bos resp. fer case the comparison of eqs. (2.13) and (3.19) resp. (2.8)
and (3.30) leads to the result (1.7) as already announced in the introduction.

we emphasize that it is already a very nontrivial check on the overall consistency
of our assumptions that all the expansion coecients, for both the bos and the
fer cases, agree. a further, very stringent consistency check is that the m/ ratio
obtained in the bos case is exactly the same as the one obtained in the fer case.
finally by comparing the free energy of the breather condensate, computed from
the tba method, eq. (2.22), with the perturbative one, eq. (3.19), one nds

by recalling that the mass of the lowest lying (r = 1) breather is m1 = 2m sin p
2 one
immediately obtains from eq. (3.31) the m/ ratio in eq. (1.7). this is clearly a fur-
ther nontrivial check on our result and on the mutual consistency of the hypothesises
made in the course of the calculation.

the ratio (1.7) diverges in the p   limit. this illustrates the fact, discussed
in subsection 2.3, that it is not possible to recover the asymptotic expansion of
the ground state energy of the o(4) model from the generic case in this limit.
furthermore m/ms also diverges as p  0 consistently with the wiegmann scenario
as discussed in subsection 2.5, while

which exactly reproduces the m/ ratio of the o(3) model rst computed in ref.
[9]. in our view this beautiful agreement certainly yields some more quantitative
support as to the correctness of the conventional wisdom.

4. lattice regularization

in this section we propose a lattice action for the deformed principal model and
calculate the free energy in this lattice version of the model. this is then used to
calculate the ratio of the -parameters of the dimensionally regulated theory and
the lattice version.

first we rewrite the lagrangian (1.1) in the form:

l0 = (1 + g)lo(4)  glo(3) ,

(4.1)

exhibiting that it interpolates between the o(3) and o(4) nonlinear -models. in
fact

lo(4) =

1


trng1go ,

(4.2)

is the familiar action of the su(2) principal chiral (or o(4)) nonlinear -model and

lo(3) =

1


aa ,

(4.3)

is the lagrangian of an o(3) symmetric nonlinear -model with a composite o(3)
eld

a =

1
2

trng1ag3o .

(4.4)

motivated by this form of the lagrangian we take as our lattice action the

following linear combination.

slattice = (1 + g0) so(4)  g0 so(3) .

(4.5)

14

here

so(4) =

1

0 xx,

trn2  g1(x)g(x + )  g1(x + )g(x)o ,

(4.6)

is the standard o(4) lattice action in terms of the su(2) principal model variable
g(x) associated to the lattice site x. (as usual, the lattice spacing a is taken to be
unity and  denotes the unit vector in the  direction. moreover, we have denoted
the bare lattice couplings by 0 and g0 to distinguish them from their counterparts
in the dimensional scheme.) similarly

so(3) =

=

1

0 xx, n1  a(x)a(x + )o
20 xx,

1

trng(x)3g1(x)g(x + )3g1(x + )  1o ,

(4.7)

is the standard o(3) lattice action in terms of the composite eld (4.4).

for simplicity we shall consider here the free energy associated to the u(1)l
charge only. this corresponds to the bos case of section 3 (i.e. hl = h, hr = 0).
an apropriate gauging of the lagrangian (4.5) and taking imaginary gauge elds
leads to:

sgauged =

+

1 + g0

0 xx,
20 xx,

trn2  g1(x)eh3
trng(x)3g1(x)eh3

g0

g(x + )  g1(x + )eh3
g(x + )3g1(x + )eh3

g(x)o
 1o ,

(4.8)

with h = h2.

the perturbative calculation of the free energy on the lattice is now completely
analogous to the one in the dimensional scheme. the leading contribution is given
again by the minimum of the gauged action for constant elds. (4.8) also takes its
minimum at the group element (3.8) and is given by

f (1)
l = 

4(1 + g0)

0a2

(cid:16) cosh ha  1(cid:17) +

g0

0a2 (cid:16) cosh 2ha  1(cid:17) ,

(4.9)

where the a-dependence has been reconstructed. in the continuum limit, a  0,
(4.9) reproduces (3.11).

the 1-loop contribution is half the logarithmic determinant of the operator cor-
responding to the quadratic term in the expansion of the lattice action around the
group element (3.8). we have not tried to calculate the 1-loop determinant for
generic g0, because for our purposes it is sucient to show that it must be of the
form

l = h2( 1  g0
f (0)

2

ln ha + wl(g0) + o(a2)) .

(4.10)

15

wl(g0) similarly to its dimensional counterpart, is a complicated function of its
argument but all we are going to need is its value at the o(3) point g0 = 1, where
it is relatively easy to evaluate. we nd

wl(1) = 

1
2 

3
2

ln 2 

5

.

(4.11)

we now proceed, as before, from the bare results (4.9) and (4.10) via the renor-

malized ones to the rg improved 1-loop formula

fl(h) =

(4.12)

where we have used the results of appendix d. comparing (3.19) and (4.12) gives
the ratio of the -parameters of the two regularization schemes:

= 32 e

5

8 .

ms
l

(4.13)

note that the ratio (4.13) is independent of the rg-invariant parameter p, but
is nevertheless dierent from the corresponding ratio of the standard o(3) model,
which is given by a formula similar to (4.13), but with an exponent that is /2
instead of 5/8. this means that our lattice regularization is dierent from the
standard one in the o(3) limit. a possible explanation for this might have been
that the dierence is due to the compositeness of our o(3) eld (4.4). but by a
simple computation we nd the standard l for g0 = 1 if the rst term in (4.5) is
simply omitted. to clarify this apparent paradox we note that the dierence is due
to the following term in the quadratic piece of the gauged lattice action.

s =

4(1 + g0)

0 xx,

cosh h (x)h(x)  (x + )i .

(4.14)

(4.14) is, of course, absent if g0 = 1. this is the case in the standard lattice version
of the o(3) model. if, however, g0 6= 1, then the coupling dependence can be scaled
out of (4.14). close to the continuum limit, after rescaling, (4.14) corresponds to
the continuum lagrangian

l =

1
2

  +

1
4

h2a2 (2)2 + o(h4a4) ,

(4.15)

from which one would naively conclude that this eld is decoupled from the external
eld h in the continuum limit. this is, however, not correct since the second term
in (4.15) does in fact contribute to the continuum free energy, because of quadratic
divergences in lattice perturbation theory. this contribution is h2/8 leading to the
modied exponent in (4.13). we expect to nd the same modied l/ms ratio by
comparing the 4-point function computed in the two regularization schemes.

16

for completeness we also computed the ms/l ratio in the o(4) symmetric
case g = 0. in this special case the function dened in (3.14) is relatively easy to
calculate. in the dimensional regularization scheme

w (0) =

1 + 2

4

,

whereas in the analogous calculation for lattice regularization we nd

wl(0) =

1

4h1 + ln 32 +



2i .

using (4.16) and (4.17) we obtain the ms/l ratio

= 32 e



4 ,

ms
l

(4.16)

(4.17)

(4.18)

in agreement with the well-known result. we note that what is new in our calculation
is that we considered the external eld coupled to ql here instead of the diagonal
charge considered previously. the ms/l ratio is the same of course, as it should.

we think that it would be extremely interesting to perform monte carlo simu-
lations using the lattice action (4.5). this would provide us with an independent
way of determining the ratio of the mass of the physical particles and the lattice 
parameter and also with an interesting example of a lattice eld theory model with
more than one relevant couplings.

5. summary and conclusions

in this paper we have computed the ground state energies of the deformed prin-
cipal model in the presence of external elds for all three possible orientations of the
external eld. we have found a complete consistency between perturbation theory
and the results from the tba method based on the proposed s-matrix of the model.
in all three cases the leading and the rst few subleading coecients of the large
eld expansion for the ground state energy are identical once we calculate the m/
ratio using one of the expansions. this beautiful agreement is absolutely nontrivial
since it can only be achieved after identifying an unusual non-analytic term in the
perturbative expansion for the fermionic case. such non-analytic terms can only
occur in perturbation theory in the presence of several couplings. to our knowledge
our example is the rst one where the results of the tba program is compared to the
results of asymptotically free perturbation theory with several coupling constants.

actually the presence of the running deformation parameter, g, made the compu-
tations much easier as compared to a purely fermionic model. in a fermionic model,
generically a three-loop calculation is necessary to obtain the m/ ratio, whereas in
the deformed model here, it has been sucient to calculate only to one-loop order!
this nice simplication is due to the fact that all higher terms are proportional to
(g + 1)2, and since for large elds g  1, they are eectively supressed.

17

we have also outlined a proof to all orders of perturbation theory that the
free energies for the two apparently dierent fermionic cases (diag and right)
actually have the same form as functions of the eective chemical potentials. we
have no explanation for this fact but it is yet another very nontrivial consistency
check since the tba integral equations are identical for the two cases.

it is also quite remarkable that the agreement between perturbation theory and
the tba method is valid for all values of the rg invariant parameter, p = 2(1 +
g)/, including the attractive regime 0 < p < 1, where the bootstrap s-matrix
indicates the existence of a complex bound state structure in the spectrum of the
model. we have found that the structure of the ground state is changing with a
decreasing p in the sense that it is always the lowest lying breather bound state
that condenses to the vacuum. the nal formula for the ground state energy is,
however, analytic for the whole range of 0 < p <  and agrees with the results of
pt. finally our results are also in perfect agreement with the wiegmann scenario
for the p  0 limit since limp0 m1/ = 8/e, (m1 being the mass of the lowest lying
breather), thus we reproduce the m/ ratio computed previously in the o(3) model.
what we found here lends also additional support to the empirical rule that only the
particle with the highest charge/mass ratio condenses in the ground state. this rule
was found to be correct in all cases considered so far [7] and proved to be correct
also for the deformed model in the attractive regime. in view of the complexity of
the spectrum of physical exitations in the attractive regime it would be extremely
interesting to nd an independent explanation of this phenomenon.

we have also proposed a simple lattice version of the su(2)u(1) symmetric
model and computed the ms/l ratio where l denotes the lattice lambda pa-
rameter.

an interesting question that requires further study is the application of the
tba program to calculate thermodynamical quantities for nite temperature and
comparing them to the results of perturbative calculations.

appendix a. solution of the tba integral equation

in the appendix of ref. [10] the solution of the pertinent integral equation de-
termining the free energy has been obtained for a generic kernel by applying the
generalized wienerhopf technique. the integral equation is given as follows:

() z b

b

dk(  )() = h  m cosh  ,

(a.1)

together with the boundary condition (b) = 0.

in terms of the solution of

18

eq. (a.1) the free energy is

f (h) = 

m

2 z b

b

d cosh()() .

(a.2)

we do not go into the details of the solution technique of eq. (a.1) as they can be
found in the literature (e.g. ref. [10]). here we just present the results in a somewhat
simplied form which could prove convenient for future applications. the crucial
step in solving eq. (a.1) by the generalized wiener-hopf method is to split the
fourier transform of the kernel in eq. (a.1), k(), as

1  k() = [g+()g()]1 ,

(a.3)

where g+() resp. g() is analytic in the upper resp. lower half plane. when
the kernel is of the fermionic type, i.e. k() 6= 1, one can assume the following
expansion of g+(i) around  = 0 for  > 0:

g+(i) = k exp {a ln }(cid:16)1 + b + o(2)(cid:17) .

(a.4)

then in the limit of high density h/m  1, the asymptotic series for f (h) can be
obtained by a simple iterative technique. the nal result, eq. (a.34) of ref. [10],
can be conveniently recast in the following form:

t  a2 ln t
t2 +
where t = ln(h/m) and the constant a is given as

f (h) = 

k2(1 +

h2
2

a

a
t2 + . . .) ,

a = a 1  b  ln

2k

g+(i)! + a2(cid:18)3

2

+ (1)  ln 2(cid:19) .

(a.5)

(a.6)

for bosonic type kernels, k(0) = 1 so the splitting functions g+(), g()
are singular at  = 0. the solution of the integral equation (a.1) is then more
complicated than in the previous (fer-type) case as the corresponding neumann
series is not uniformly convergent and the solution cannot be obtained by simple
iteration. the solution of eq. (a.1) for a generic bos-type kernel in the limit
t = ln(h/m)   has been given in ref. [12] up to order of ln t/t. according to
the results of ref. [12] for g+(i) admitting the following expansion around  = 0
( > 0)

g+(i) =

k


exp{a ln }(cid:16)1  b + o(2)(cid:17) ,

(a.7)

the asymptotic series for t  1 of the legendre transform of ground state energy
density can be expressed in the form

f (h) = 

h2

k2 (cid:18)t + (a +

appendix b. bootstrap fusion

in this appendix we calculate the phase shifts corresponding to the scattering
of two bound state particles of charge (2,0) and of lowest mass m1 = 2m sin p
2
in terms of the scattering phases of the elementary particles of charge (1,1) and
(1,-1). the procedure is called bootstrap fusion and being an important part of
the whole bootstrap program is discussed at length in the literature [13, 18, 20].
therefore we just apply the general framework to the special case of our interest,
but even this could prove to be useful for other models.

we shall assume that the s-matrix describing the scattering of the elementary

particles of mass m can be decomposed as

s
 () = xe

where the orthogonal projectors satisfy



e se()e

the scattering phases may have poles in the physical sheet 0  im   of the form

mb = 2m cos

(b.3)

(b.4)

then one can use the bootstrap fusion procedure to calculate the s-matrix of the
bound states from the s-matrix of their constituents. we assume further that the
bound state, b, occurs only in one of the chanels (which we shall label e = b) and
that the scattering of b is diagonal with all other (elementary or composite) particles
from the spectrum of the model. then the scattering of b and x (which can be one
of the constituents or some composite particle) is given by

sbx() = x,, x, ,

charges (which can be 1 or -1) and the four scattering chanels are labeled (0, 0,).

(b.14) as the product of this sg scattering coming from the second factor in (1.4)
multiplied by the diagonal soliton-soliton scattering coming from the rst one.

having obtained the bound state-particle scattering, we now apply (b.5) once

more to nd the b  b scattering phase, (2,0)(). using (b.14) in (b.5) we nd

before we can expand the lagrangian in powers of the coupling constant 0 we

have to rescale our elds as follows.

the leading, o(1

terms are of the order o(1) and are given by half the logarithmic determinant of
the operator corresponding to the free lagrangian, that is the piece quadratic in
the elds  and . this free lagrangian can be written in the bos case as

l(0) =   +

in both cases, only two elds are really coupled to the external elds. these are
the real part of  and  in the bos case and the real and imaginary parts of  in
the fer case. this allows us to write l(0) as an eective lagrangian of two bosons

(c.15)

we have seen in section 3 that the 1-loop result in the fer case, (3.23), is a
function of the sum hl + hr only, similarly to the classical term (3.20). the free
energy calculated by the tba method also has this property. it is a very non-trivial
fact that this behaviour can be reproduced by the perturbative calculation. in fact,
we will now show that in the diagonal case the free energy depends only on the sum
hl + hr to all orders of perturbation theory.

to show this, we introduce the shifted derivatives

2 = 2 +  ,

and

2 = 2   .

(c.16)

using this notation, the gauged lagrangian can be compactly written as

l = l0

where l0 stands for the original lagrangian, (c.3), with all 2 and 2 substituted
by the shifted derivatives (c.16). the advantage of using the form of the lagrangian,
(c.17), is that the explicit dependence on the external elds hl, hr occurs only
through the combination m = (1 + g0)(hl + hr).
in addition to this, there is
still an implicit dependence on the external elds through  hidden in the shifted
derivatives (c.16). this disappears, however, since the lagrangian (c.17) is in fact
equivalent to another one, denoted by lm , diering from l only by replacing all
shifted derivatives, 2, by ordinary ones.

24

the fact that l and lm are completely equivalent can be best illustrated in the
case of the o(1) contribution to the free energy. the relevant piece of the lagrangian
is (c.10), which can also be written as

l(0) =   +

1
2

  + m 2 ||2 .

(c.18)

the substitution 2  2 corresponds to the shift p2  p2 + i in momentum space.
more precisely, when integrating over p2 in eq. (3.21) the above shift corresponds
to deforming the integration contour parallel to the real axis. this deformation is
allowed since the singularities of the integrand at

p2 = i  iqp2

1 + m 2 ,

(c.19)

lie outside the region between the real axis and the shifted contour (guaranteed by
the inegality (3.10)). after shifting the integration variable eq. (3.21) takes the
simple form

dnp
(2)n

m 2

p2 + m 2 ,

f (0) =

2

n z

(c.20)

which is easily evaluated and yields (3.23). now eq. (c.20) can be derived from the
simplied lagrangian

l(0)
m =   +

1
2

  + m 2 ||2 ,

(c.21)

exhibiting the one-loop equivalence between l and lm .

it is easy to generalize this argument to show that there is a one-to-one corre-
spondence between the feynman diagrams generated by l and lm and that the
perturbative results are identical for these two models, diagram by diagram, to all
orders of perturbation theory. this equivalence follows from the fact that the shift
p2  p2 + i can be performed simultaneously in all momentum variables corre-
sponding to the lines of a multi-loop feynman diagram. in this way we have shown
that all dependence on the external elds comes from the m-dependence of lm .
this means, in particular, that the free energy in the diagonal case takes the form
(3.24, 3.25) and it is a function of the sum h = hl + hr only, which is exactly the
same as the free energy for the u(1)r case (as a function of hr).

appendix d. renormalization group equations

due to its su(2)lu(1)r symmetry, the model (1.1) is renormalizable in per-
turbation theory. (of course, in eq. (1.1) actually the bare coupling 0 and the bare
g-parameter g0 occur.) using dimensional regularization, the relation between the
bare parameters, (0, g0), and the renormalized ones, (, g), is written as:

0 =  z ,

and

1 + g0 = (1 + g) zg .

(d.1)

25

in eq. (d.1) the dimensionful parameter, , is introduced as usual, to carry the
mass dimension of 0 (which is dimensionless in 2 dimensions). the renormalization
constants contain only pole terms in the variable  = 2  n:

z = 1 +

zg = 1 +



xr=1
xr=1



yr(, g)

r

wr(, g)

r

,

.

(d.2)

(d.3)

the residues of the poles, yr and wr, can be calculated in perturbation theory:

yr(, g) , wr(, g) = o(r) .

(d.4)

it is clear from (d.1) that if g = 1, then also g0 = 1. this is a conse-
quence of the fact that at this value of the deformation parameter the model (1.1)
reduces to the o(3) nonlinear -model (plus a free boson), which is obvious from
the parametrization used in section 4. an other special value of the deformation
coupling is g = 0 implying g0 = 0 and wr(, 0) = 0 in eq. (d.3). in this case the
deformation actually vanishes and we have the su(2)lsu(2)r (or o(4)) symmetric
principal -model. in a sense the deformed model (1.1) interpolates between the
o(3) and o(4) nonlinear -models.

physical quantities depend on the renormalized couplings , g and the dimen-
sionful parameter  in such a way that the action of the renormalization group (rg)
operator

d = 




+ (, g)

+ g(, g)

,

(d.5)





g

vanishes on them. here the two -functions are obtained from the residues of the
rst order poles in (d.2) and (d.3) as

 = 2 y1


,

and

g = (1 + g)

w1


.

(d.6)

for later use we note that in the fer case the free energy, eq. (3.25), can be

written as

f (h) = 2h2( 1 + g0
0 

(1 + g0)2

20

s(g0, 0[h(1 + g0)])) ,

(d.7)

where s stands for the innite sum in (3.25). from (d.7) we can conclude that at
g = 1 z = zg and in particular,

w1(,1) = y1(,1) .

(d.8)

26

in both bos and fer cases, the free energy takes the form

(d.9)
where the function f0 is rg invariant: df0 = 0. as we are interested in the
asymptotic expansion of the free energy for large external elds we write

f (h) = h2 f0(, g, , h) ,

(d.10)
where h0 is a xed, nite value of the external eld and t  . standard rg
considerations then show that

h = h0 et ,

(d.11)
where the running coupling  and the running deformation parameter g satisfy the
following set of dierential equations and initial conditions.

f (h) = h2 f0((t), g(t), , h0) ,

(d.12)

(d.13)

in the deformed principal model the -functions are known to be of the form

[14, 15]

 = 

2

g =

4(1  g + p2(g) + 2p3(g) +   ) ,
(1 + q1(g) + 2q2(g) +   ) ,

g(1 + g)

where the two-loop -function coecients are given by [14, 15]

p2(g) =

1  2g + 5g2

8

,

and

q1(g) =

1  g
4

.

(d.14)

(d.15)

(d.16)

the three-loop coecients p3(g), q2(g) are not known at present, but fortunately we
will not need their explicit form beyond the combination

u = 2q2(1)  p3(1) .

(d.17)

we are interested in solutions of (d.12) and (d.13) with asymptotically free (af)
behaviour, that is   0 together with g  g1 as t  , where g1 is some constant.
analyzing eqs. (d.14), (d.15), we nd three dierent af solutions:

1.
2.
3.

g1 = 0
g1 = 1
g1 = 1

g  g0  g  0 ,
g  g0  g  1 ,
1 < g < 0 .

(d.18)
(d.19)
(d.20)

27

solutions (d.18) resp. (d.19) correspond to the o(4) resp. the o(3) nls model,
while the solution (d.20) corresponds to the generic case of deformed principal
model. in what follows we shall concentrate on the generic case. we introduce the
rg-invariant combination of the two couplings:

p = 2 lim
t

1 + g(t)

(t)

,

(d.21)

which we identify with the parameter p in the s matrix (1.4). a rg-invariant
quantity can almost be treated just as a numerical parameter. we can express
the running deformation coupling, g, in terms of the running coupling,  and the
rg-invariant p as

(d.22)

(d.23)

g = (, p)

and dene an eective -function for  as

e(, p) = (, (, p)) .

using the perturbative expressions (d.14) and (d.15) together with (d.16) and
(d.17) we have

(, p) = 1 +

p
2

 + p(2)2 + p(3)3 +    ,

where

p(2) = 

p2
82 ,

and

p(3) =

p2(p + 2)

643 +

pu
8

.

(d.24)

(d.25)

the unknown three-loop coecients contribute only to u dened in eq. (d.17). it
is not dicult to show using eq. (d.8) that

implying u = 0.

2q2(1) = p3(1) ,

using the perturbative form (d.24) in the denition (d.23) we have

e(, p) = 

2
2

+

p  2
82 3 +    ,

(d.26)

(d.27)

which allows the denition of the rg-invariant -parameter in the ms scheme the
usual way:

ms =  e 2

21)

2(cid:17)( p
 (cid:16) 

en1 + o()o .

(d.28)

the next step in the rg analysis is the introduction of the eective coupling

e(h) dened by the transcendental equation

2
e

+(cid:16) p

2  1(cid:17) ln

2
e

= ln

h
ms

.

28

(d.29)

the advantage of using the eective charge is that it is a function of the physical
quantity

h
ms

s = ln

,

(d.30)

only and moreover the running coupling can be expressed in terms of e(h) pertur-
batively (in the sense that it is an innite power series):

 = e +

1

2(cid:16) ln

h0

  (cid:17)2

e +    .

(d.31)

the asymptotic expansion (for large s) of the eective coupling (containing terms
 ln s) can be written as

e =

2
s

+

(p  2)

s2

ln s +    .

(d.32)

so far we have concentrated on the generic case (d.20). the o(3) symmetric
limit, case (d.19), (p  0) corresponds to putting simply p = 0 in eq. (d.32). the
o(4) limit, (d.18), however, cannot be obtained from the generic case although it
corresponds formally to the p   limit. (see the discussion in subsection 2.3.)

for lattice regularization some of the above formulae are modied. first of all,
instead of (d.1) and (d.2-d.3) the relation between the bare parameters (0, g0) and
the renormalized ones (, g) are given by

0 =  z ,

and

1 + g0 = (1 + g) zg ,

(d.33)

where

z = 1 +

zg = 1 +



xr=1
xr=1



yr(, g) (ln a)r ,

wr(, g) (ln a)r .

(d.34)

(d.35)

here the parameter  is the lattice analogue of the -variable of the dimensional
scheme and naturally it is  that appears in the lattice version of (d.5). the lattice
-functions are given by
 =  y1(, g) ,

g = (1 + g) w1(, g) .

(d.36)

and

the rest of the rg analysis is identical to the one in the dimensional scheme.
although the higher order -functions are dierent, the main features of the rg tra-
jectories (d.18-d.20) remain the same and also the rst two coecients of e(, p)
are unchanged. the lattice version of the -parameter is given by

l =  e 2
 (cid:16)
