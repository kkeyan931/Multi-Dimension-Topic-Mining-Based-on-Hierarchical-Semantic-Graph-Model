abstract

supergravity on ads3s3t4 has dual description as a conformal sigma-model
with the target space the moduli space of instantons on the noncommutative torus.
we derive the precise relation between the parameters of this noncommutative torus
and the parameters of the near-horizon geometry. we show that the low energy dy-
namics of the system of d1d5 branes wrapped on the torus of nite size is described
in terms of noncommutative geometry. as a byproduct, we give a prediction on the
dependence of the moduli space of instantons on the noncommutative t4 on the
metric and the noncommutativity parameter. we give a compelling evidence that
the moduli space of stringy instantons on r4 with the b eld does not receive -
corrections. we also study the relation between the d1d5 sigma-model instantons
and the supergravity instantons.

1 introduction.

the formalism of noncommutative geometry is useful in string theory when one studies
some special points in the moduli space of compactications. in string theory, small size
manifolds are related to nite size manifolds by t duality. however, the required t duality
transformation usually does not have a nice limit when the size of the manifold goes to
zero. the form of the t duality which brings the background with the small size manifold
to the background with the nite size manifold depends very irregularly on the moduli of
the small size manifold (such as b eld). therefore, naively one would expect that the
physics also does not have a limit. but it turns out that there exists a smooth description
of physics at small size in terms of the noncommutative geometry. this amazing fact was
discovered in string perturbation theory in [1] and in the study of the matrix theory in
[2]. more precise relation between the noncommutative geometry and the string theory
has been established in the recent paper by n. seiberg and e. witten [3].

considering eld theory on the noncommutative space may be thought of as intro-
ducing some kind of non-locality. this non-locality should presumably lead to softening
some of the eld theory divergences (as discussed, for example, in [4]). one important
example is resolution of singularities in the instanton moduli spaces. it was pointed out in
[5], that introducing noncommutativity for the eld theory on r4 is equivalent, from the
point of view of the instanton moduli space, to considering the adhm construction with
the nonzero value of the hyperkahler momentum map. (in other words, it introduces
the fayet-illiopoulos terms in the adhm sigma-model). this discovery has an important
application in the study of the string theory on anti-desitter space. it was conjectured
in [6], that this theory has a dual description in terms of the conformal eld theory. more
precisely, the type iib string theory on ads3  s3  x, where x is k3 or t4, is dual
to the conformal sigma-model whose target space is the moduli space of instantons on x.
this proposal, suggested in [6] and further studied in [7, 8, 9], is valid at the specic sub-
space of the moduli space. on this subspace, the uxes of the nsns b eld through the
two-cycles of x are zero. it was found in [10], that the non-zero uxes of b correspond to
non-zero value of the moment map in the adhm construction. therefore, string theory
on ads3  s3  x with nonzero b eld corresponds to the conformal sigma-model on the
moduli space of instantons on the noncommutative x.
the purpose of this paper is to x the precise relation between the parameters of the
noncommutative sym theory and the parameters of the near-horizon geometry. we will
proceed in the following way. wrapping q4 d5 branes on x, qi
2 d3 branes on the ith
two-cycle of x, and adding q0 d-strings unwrapped, we end up having a black-string
in 5 + 1-dimensional at space. the background ads3  s3  x arises in type iib as the
near-horizon limit of this black string. the corresponding supergravity solution looks in
a neighborhood of a given point in 5 + 1-dimensional space as r5+1  x, but the moduli
of x depend on the distance from the black string. for such a solution, let us consider
the geometry of x near the horizon (which we denote x h) and x far away from the

1

string (denote it x). given x, one can nd x h, using the supergravity equations of
motion. it turns out, that x h cannot be arbitrary k3 (or t4): the moduli of x h should
satisfy certain attractor conditions [11]. on the other hand, the moduli of x can be
arbitrary. therefore, the correspondence x 7 x h is not one-to-one: for each x h, the
whole family of x corresponds. in fact, for a given attractor x h, there is a whole family
of small size x owing to it.

the cft dual to the near-horizon supergravity can be found using the procedure
suggested by maldacena [6]. we look at the worldsheet theory of the corresponding system
of branes. in the low-energy limit, it becomes conformal. according to the maldacena
conjecture, this is the conformal theory dual to ads supergravity. the worldsheet eective
theory feels the at background, the one which would be there without branes. the
geometry of this background is r1+5x. as we have explained, there are many possible
x which give the same near-horizon x h. the low energy theories on the worldvolume
of the black string should be equivalent for all the backgrounds x owing to the same
x h. this follows from ads/cf t correspondence. however, the equivalence between the
worldvolume theories for dierent x can be very nontrivial. we want to nd, in the
corresponding family of at backgrounds x, the one which gives the simplest description
of the worldsheet theory. at rst sight, the most appealing possibility would be to nd
x of very large size. if we could do that, we would get the description of our cft as
the sigma model with the target space the moduli space of yang-mills instantons. but it
turns out that most of the attractors x h cannot be obtained as the near-horizon limit of
the solutions with very large x. what we can do instead is to nd a representative with
very small x. for such backgrounds, the low-energy eective action is formulated rather
explicitly in terms of the noncommutative geometry. we can use the results of [3] relating
the shape of x and b eld uxes to the parameters of the noncommutative manifold,

which we will denote gx. according to [3], the eective low-energy theory for the bound
state of d1, d3 and d5 is supersymmetric yang-mills theory on gx  r1+1. therefore,
the target space the moduli space of instantons on gx.

the eective low-energy theory for the black string is 1 + 1-dimensional sigma-model with
(in fact, there is a subtlety
here which we will discuss later). this gives the dual description of the near-horizon
supergravity.

let us mention an interesting consequence of this correspondence. since we have a
whole family of small-size x, corresponding to the given near-horizon geometry, we
get the whole family of noncommutative manifolds, therefore the whole family of sigma-
models. they are all the descriptions of the same ads supergravity. therefore, given
two noncommutative manifolds from the same family, the moduli spaces of instantons on
these manifolds should be isomorphic. it has been proven in [3] that instantons on r4
depend only on the self-dual part of the noncommutativity parameter. the ads/cf t
correspondence allows us to formulate the analogue of this statement for instantons on
t4.

the relation between the near-horizon geometry and the moduli of the dual cft has

2

been studied in great detail in the paper by r. dijkgraaf [12]. the precise correspondence
between the parameters of the attractor and the moduli space of the dual cft has been
given in that paper. combined with our paper, this gives the description of the geometry
of the moduli space of instantons on the noncommutative torus.

another application of our formulas is the study of the low-energy dynamics of d-
branes wrapped on the torus of the nite size (of the order ls). the most straightforward
way of doing it would consist of two steps: 1) study the low-energy worldvolume theory
of d5 branes wrapped on t4 (with the numbers of d1 and d3 specifying the topological
sector of this theory); 2) compactify this low energy theory on t4, to get the low energy
theory of the black string. however, we think that performing the rst step is very hard for
the nite size torus. we do not know how to construct the low-energy theory describing
the slow degrees of freedom of n > 1 branes of nite size in the nontrivial topological
sector. (the nonabelian born-infeld theory [24] is valid when the covariant derivatives
of the eld strength are small, and this condition is not satised in our case). but we
can bypass the rst step and go directly to the low energy dynamics of the black string.
indeed, our considerations show that it is equivalent to the low energy dynamics of branes
wrapped on some very small torus. one has just to nd the small torus which ows to the
same near-horizon x h as the given nite size torus. therefore, the low energy lagrangian
for the black string can always be represented as the sigma-model on the moduli space of
noncommutative instantons.

there is a subtlety in the relation between the instanton sigma model and the low-
energy supergravity on ads3. the statement that the low-energy dynamics of the d1d5
system is described by the sigma-model on the moduli space of instantons follows from
the dimensional reduction of the 1 + 5-dimensional classical super yang-mills theory on
the noncommutative torus. strictly speaking, we can treat this 1 + 5-dimensional theory
classically only if it is weakly coupled on the compactication scale. on the other hand,
classical ads supergravity is valid only if the radius of curvature of ads space is large
enough. it turns out that these two conditions are incompatible: we cannot trust dimen-
sional reduction in the regime where ads supergravity is valid. however, we conjecture
that the shape of the target-space of the sigma-model describing the dynamics of d1d5
system is, in fact, independent of the string coupling constant. we give two arguments
conrming this conjecture. first argument is based on considering the dependence of
the sigma-model for d1d5 system on the parameters of the background. as we have
explained before, in the strong coupling regime (where ads supergravity is valid), the
ads/cft correspondence implies that the sigma-model depends only on some special
combinations of the background elds. in other words, there are equivalence classes of
backgrounds giving the same sigma-model. it turns out, that this statement in fact does
not depend on the validity of ads supergravity, and can be derived from supersymmetry.
moreover, the argument based on supersymmetry does not require gstrn to be large; the
structure of equivalence classes does not depend on gstr. although this does not neces-
sarily imply that the structure of the target space is independent on gstr, we think that it

3

supports the conjecture. the second argument is based on the relation between the world-
sheet instantons of the d1d5 sigma model and the d-instantons of the six-dimensional
supergravity. an example of this relation was given in [17]. instantons in toroidally com-
pactied string theories where considered in [14, 15, 16]. we argue that under certain
conditions there is a correspondence between these two kinds of instantons, and the ac-
tion of the world-sheet instantons is equal to the action of the supergravity instantons.
the action of the worldsheet instantons is related to the period map of the target space
(which is a hyper-kahler manifold). and the action of the supergravity instantons can
be found when gstr is small from supergravity. the formula agrees with the period map
for the target space conjectured in [12] and is obviously independent on n. this suggests
that the target space for small gstrn and large gstrn should have the same period map.
therefore the hyper-kahler structure of the target space is the same in the regime when
we can use dimensional reduction and in the regime when we can trust supergravity.

it was claimed in [13] that the moduli space of the twisted little string theories on
t3 is the moduli space of noncommutative instantons on t4. this result was derived by
relating the theory on ns5 brane to the d2d6 system, with d6-brane wrapped on a
four-torus. strictly speaking, d2d6 system on t4 is described by the noncommutative
yang-mills theory only when this four-torus is very small. however, the situation with
the d2d6 system should be similar to what happens with d1d5: namely, the moduli
space does not depend on some combination of the background elds, and there is a small
torus in each equivalence class. therefore, the moduli space is always the moduli space
of noncommutative instantons.

the paper is organized as follows. in the second section, we give a brief review of the
attractor equations and explain when the supergravity approximation can be trusted. in
the third section, we give the argument for independence of the sigma-model on certain
combinations of the background elds, based on supersymmetry (this section is auxiliary,
and it is not necessary for understanding the rest of the paper). in the fourth section, we
derive the relation between the asymptotic background and the near-horizon (attractive)
background. this section is somewhat technical. the main formula is (56), giving the
condition for two backgrounds to ow to the same attractor. the formula (63) expresses
the near-horizon ramond-ramond elds in terms of the ramond-ramond elds at inn-
ity. in the fth section, we review the correspondence between the string theory on the
small torus and the yang-mills theory on the noncommutative torus. combining these
results with the results from the fourth section, we construct the ows on the moduli
space of the noncommutative tori, which leave the moduli space of instantons invariant.
in subsection 5.2 we make an observation which suggests that the moduli space of in-
stantons on noncommutative r4 does not receive -corrections.
in the sixths section
we discuss the relation between the world-sheet instantons and the supergravity instan-
tons. in appendix a, we review the correspondence between the moduli of the type iib
compactication and the points of grassmanian.

the dependence of k3 (or t 4) moduli on the distance from the horizon is given by the
attractor equation. this equation can be found in many papers, for example in the
review [18], although in somewhat implicit form. in this section, we will briey review
the attractor equations and present them in the form most convenient for our purposes.
we will concentrate on the case x = k3. first we will review some properties of
the chiral n = 4 d = 6 supergravity, and then nd the solution corresponding to d1d5
system. we will follow the original paper [19], but using slightly dierent language. this
theory describes an interaction of n = 4b gravity multiplet with n tensor multiplets.
for the compactication of type iib on k3, we have n = 21. the eld content of the
gravity multiplet is a graviton, four left-handed gravitini and ve antisymmetric tensors
with selfdual eld strength. the tensor multiplet consists of an antisymmetric tensor
with antiselfdual eld strength, four right-handed symplectic majorana spinors and ve
scalars. to describe the interacting theory, we think of the scalars as parametrizing the
coset

we represent this coset as the manifold of ve-dimensional positive planes in the space

l = r5+21

for a given ve-plane w  l, we denote p+ the projector on this plane, and p the
projector on the orthogonal plane. we denote the 1 + 5 dimensional minkowski space m.
the eld strengths of the gravity multiplet and the tensor multiplets may be combined
in a vector h  3m  l, with the constraint

 h = (p+  p)h

(1)

instead of writing p+h and ph, we will often write h+ and h. let s1/2
 m be the
bundle of antichiral spinors on m, and s3/2
+ m the bundle of rarita-schwinger elds
(chiral spinors with vector indices). also, we denote w+ the tautological bundle on the
grassmanian gr(5, 5 + 21), that is the bundle whose ber over the point represented by
the plane w is the plane w itself. similarly, w will denote the bundle whose ber is
w . the gravitino  and the fermions  from the tensor multiplets are the sections of
the following bundles:

  ([s3/2
  ([s1/2

+ m  s(w+)]r)
 m  s(w+)]r  w)

(2)

5

here s(w+) is the spinor bundle associated with the spin(5) vector bundle2 w+ (we
will call its sections internal spinors). the subindices r mean that some majorana
conditions are imposed. let us explain the majorana conditions for . (s3/2

we have denoted c(1) and c(2) the charge conjugation matrices for the space-time spinors
and the internal spinors, respectively. the majorana condition for  is dened in the
same way. the supersymmetry generators  are space-time and internal spinors:

vector h+  w+ acts on s(w+) index of  as gamma-matrices act on spinors. d is
a covariant derivative, which includes the natural connection on w+. in the expression
for ,  denotes the point in the moduli space of scalars. its derivative  acts on  as
follows. there is a natural isomorphism between the tangent bundle to gr(5, 5 + 21) and
w  w+. indeed, a tangent vector to gr(5, 5 + 21) is an innitesimal rotation w of
the plane w , and it is completely specied by saying what is w  w  for each vector
w  w . this gives us a map from w to w , or a section of w  w+. since l is
equipped with a metric, we can identify w+ with w+. this means, that we can think of
d as an element of w  w+  1m. then, to act on   ([s1/2
+ m  s(w+)]r) by
  w  w+, we use the action of w+ on s(w+) (gamma-matrices act on spinors)
and tensor multiplication by w. after acting by the space-time gamma-matrix , we
get a section of the bundle (s1/2
we want to nd a supersymmetric background, corresponding to our black string.
this means that for some parameters , we should have  = 0 and  = 0. (there will
be eight of them). we will try the following ansatz for the metric:

 m  s(w+))r  w, which is where  lives.

2the moduli space of scalars is topologically trivial (the global coordinates may be found, for example,

ds2 = e2u (r)(dt2  dx2)  e2u (r)(dr2 + r2d2
3)

(5)

in [20]). therefore, there is no dierence between the spin(5) bundles and the so(5) bundles.

let us introduce the vielbein {et, ex, er, e1, e2, e3}, so that
3xi=1

ds2 = (et)2  (ex)2  (er)2 

(ei)2

we use the following ansatz for the three-form eld strength:

hijk =

r3 ijkz,

htxr = 

e3u
r3 z

(6)

the vector z should be integer-valued, z  5,21  l, because the uxes of h through s3
are integers. this vector should be identied with the charge of the black string. we look
for supersymmetry with the parameter  which depends only on r. also, we assume that
the scalars depend only on r. first, let us write explicitly the transformations of various
components of . we will denote  the covariant derivative on w+. we do not need to
know explicitly what is the spin connection in w+, only the space-time spin-connection
will be important for us. we have the following conditions for  = 0 (with u = du

this is consistent with ( z+  xt) = 0 because, as we will see below, z+ is covariantly
constant (that is, r z+(r) = 0). the last equation in (7) follows from (8) if one takes
into account that  is chiral.

now we turn to the variation of the fermions from tensor multiplets. we have:

using the chirality condition 123 = txr and equations (8), we reduce  = 0 to the
following equation on :

(11)

d = 2du

||z+||2 z  z+

this formula has a very clear geometrical meaning. remember that we represent tangent
vectors to the moduli space of scalars as linear maps from w to w , giving the variations
of vectors in w . suppose that we took a vector w  w which is orthogonal to z. then
(z+  w) = 0 and (11) tells us that the variation of w is zero. therefore, the subspace
w  z  w remains constant. we can represent w = (w  z)  rz+. when r
changes (w  z) remains constant and the one-dimensional subspace rz+ gets rotated
in the plane rz+rz. the near-horizon background is represented by (w z)rz:

let us write it more explicitly. introduce the hyperbolic angle  between the vector z
and the plane w . let z+ = (||z+||2)1/2z+ and z = (||z||2)1/2z. then,

(this is the denition of ) and

z = cosh  z+ + sinh  z

(this is d from (11) applied to the vector z+  w+). combining these two equations,
we have

d = 2 tanh du

u and  on r:

1) the system of q0 d-strings and q4 d5-branes with b = 0. (the corresponding
supergravity solution has been found in [21]). the plane w is generated by three vectors

the attractor equations have a lagrangean interpretation. indeed, let us introduce

(26)

the expression ||p+z||2  ||pz||2 = 2||p+z||2  ||z||2 is, up to the coecient and the
constant term, the square of the tension of the black string. at the attracting point, that

10

is when p+z = z, this tension reaches its minimum. also, we can see from our solution
(17), that e4u is zero at the horizon. therefore, the motion in  , corresponding to the
geometry of the black string, may be considered as climbing up the potential. the
initial velocity should be adjusted in such a way that getting to the top requires innite
time.

in what follows, we will not need the full solution for u(r) and w (r). the only thing
important for us is that w changes with r in such a way that w (r)z remains constant,
and also that the near-horizon w is w h = (w  z)  rz.

2.2 when can we use supergravity approximation?

we want to be able to use supergravity equations until we reach small enough values of r
(where the moduli are close to their xed values). the low energy eective action does not
receive any quantum corrections because of the supersymmetry. therefore, supergravity
is valid when we can neglect higher derivative corrections. we will assume that the near-
horizon string coupling is weak, therefore the main source of higher derivative corrections
is the string perturbation theory. these corrections behave like a positive power of lstr
r
where r is the typical radius of curvature. therefore, the condition that supergravity is
applicable is that the size of the ads region is much larger then lstr. let us explain what
we mean by the size of the ads region. the metric for the d1d5 solution contains
factors of the form

1 + 0

eq||z||2

r2

1 + 0

eq||z||2

r2



we are in ads regime when we can approximate this expression as 2
 > 0, we see that the ads regime starts at

0||z||2
r4

r2 < r2

cr = 0eq||z||2

. assuming

(27)

the condition for supergravity to be valid is that rcr >> lstr. now let us estimate lstr in
the near-horizon region. it is convenient to start with estimating the size of the core of
the d-string. for the typical attractor, all the moduli of the near-horizon torus are of the
order one, therefore all the black d-strings (for example, d1, d3 wrapped on two-cycle
and d5 wrapped on t4) have approximately the same string length and the same size of
the core. for the typical d-string in the typical background the size of the core is

core, d  gstrl2
r2

str

(28)

as a typical d-string, let us choose the string with the charge

z||z||2 . this charge is

usually not integer, but we need only the supergravity solution. it has the metric with

one can see from this expression that the size of the core for the d-string at the coordinate
distance r0 from the origin is of the order

this equation together with (28) implies

(remember that we measure all the lengths for the torus in string units). the right hand
side of this expression has a clear physical meaning. it is the thooft coupling constant for

the 1+5 dimensional super yang-mills on r1,1ft4 on the scale of the size of ft4. (here ft4

is the noncommutative torus dual to the torus t4 at innity as explained in section 5).
our estimate (33) tells us that in the regime when we can trust the supergravity solution
in ads region, the six-dimensional noncommutative yang-mills describing d1d5 system
is necessarily strongly coupled on the compactication scale. therefore, we cannot trust
the classical dimensional reduction. we conjecture that the shape of the target space of
the sigma-model on r1,1 which is the dimensional reduction of this six-dimensional theory
actually does not depend on the six-dimensional coupling constant. we will give some
evidence conrming this conjecture in section 6.

3 argument based on supersymmetry.

in this section we will give another argument for the equivalence of the low energy eec-
tive worldsheet theories for the black strings in the backgrounds belonging to the same
equivalence class. this argument is based on supersymmetry and does not use ads/cf t

12

correspondence. our argument is very close to the argument used in [22] to prove inde-
pendence of the hypermultiplet metric on the scalars in vector multiplet.

we will study some auxiliary brane conguration.

it consists of the system of n
parallel black strings, all having the same charge q. this system has a coulomb branch.
let us consider the submanifold of this coulomb branch, where n  1 black strings sit at
one point (the origin), and one is moving around. we will call that black string which is
moving around the single black string. we want to look at the worldsheet theory of this
single black string. the low-energy worldsheet theory is some sigma model. consider the

v
gstr

target space cm of this sigma-model. roughly speaking, it can be parametrized by the

position in the transversal r4 plus the internal degrees of freedom, which specify the
instanton on t4. notice that the size of the moduli space of instantons on t4 is of the
order
and does not depend on n, while the characteristic distances in the transversal

r4 are growing with n. (from our solution, we see that r2  nq||z||2.) therefore, in
the limit n  , we can consider the internal degrees of freedom as fast, and the
motion along r4 as slow. moreover, in this limit the single black string sitting at some
point x  r4 presumably does not feel that the background changes with the distance
from the origin. therefore, the conguration space of the internal degrees of freedom
should be approximately the same hyperkahler manifold as for the black string in at

cm m r4

space. in other words, in the limit n   we can think of cm as a bundle with the base
r4 and the ber the moduli space m(x) of internal degrees of freedom of d1d5 wrapped
on t4(x):
(34)
the dependence of t4(x) on the point x  r4 (and therefore the dependence of m(x) on
x) is dictated by the supergravity solution for n  1 black strings sitting at the origin.
our arguments will go as follows. we will prove, using supersymmetry, that although
the moduli of the torus t4 depend on the distance from the origin, the ber m does not.
but in the limit n  , the ber m(x0) over the given point x0  r4 is the same as
the target space m0 for the d1d5 in the at background with the torus t4(x)  t4(x0).
therefore, independence of m(x0) on x0 implies that the target space for d1d5 is the
same for all the backgrounds t4 = t4(x0), x0  r4. since t4(x0) depends only on
the distance r of x0 from the origin, we had proven that the moduli space of d1d5 is
the same for the backgrounds from the given one-parametric family t4(r), r  [0,].
in particular, it is the same for t4(r = 0) and t4(r = ). this implies, that all the
backgrounds at innity r =  which ow to the same near-horizon t4(r = 0) give the
same moduli space.
let us proceed with the proof. we want to understand what kind of restrictions the

supersymmetry imposes on the geometry of our target space cm. it is useful to start with
considering the at sigma-model, which describes the dynamics of d1d5 in at space
(without n  1 strings at the origin). in this case, we would have:

cm0 = r4  m0

13

where m0 does not depend on the point of the base. both r4 and m0 are hyperkahler,
and therefore we get the system with (4, 4) supersymmetry. in fact, there are two hyper-
kahler structures on r4: one with the self-dual hyperkahler forms, and the other with
anti-self-dual. closer examination of the supersymmetry transformations shows that they
are dierent in the left- and right-moving sectors: the left-moving (4, 0) supersymmetry
uses self-dual complex structures on r4, and the right-moving one uses anti-self-dual
complex structures.

when we introduce n1 black strings at the origin, the at target space gets corrected
 for example, the metric on r4 is not at anymore. nevertheless, our manifold cm
should still support sigma-model with (4, 4) supersymmetry. this follows from the fact
that our single black string preserves the same supersymmetry as those n1 black strings
which we have added. therefore, introducing these n  1 black strings does not break
any more supersymmetry. the (4, 4) supersymmetry implies the existence of six complex
structures, three for the left-moving sector, and three for the right-moving [23]. the
sigma-model action can include torsion, which is an antisymmetric tensor b with db 6= 0.
the lagrangian is:

l = g(dx   dx ) + gab(da  db)+

+bdx   dx  + 2badx   da + babda  db

(35)

here we denote x  the coordinates in r4, and a the coordinates in the ber (the moduli
space of instantons). the complex structures should be covariantly constant, but with
respect to the modied connection, with the torsion t = db added. the sign of the torsion
is opposite for the left and the right connections. we will write this condition explicitly
for the corresponding kahler forms:

i  t 

i  t 

i = 0

(36)

(the index i = 1, 2, 3 distinguishes between three dierent kahler forms, and the sign 
distinguishes between the right and the left sectors). in our situation, we know something
about these six complex structures from comparison to the at case. we know that in
the vicinity of a given ber, the kahler forms are:

i = i(0)dx   dx  + i(0)abda  db + small corrections

(37)

here i(0) are the basic self-dual (with plus) or anti-self-dual (with minus) forms on r4,
and i(0)ab are the kahler forms on at m0. the corrections are small, because locally
our background is almost at. in at case, the left kahler forms on m0 coincide with the
right kahler forms, therefore it might seem strange that we are using the superscript  to
distinguish between i+
(0)ab and i(0)ab. the reason why we distinguish them is the following.
the forms i should be covariantly constant (with modied connection). in particular,
they should be covariantly constant along the radial direction in r4. although the three-
dimensional space generated by i+
(0)ab and i(0)ab coincide, we do not apriori exclude the

14

possibility that the covariantly constant bases in these spaces are dierent in left and
write sectors.

we also have some information about the torsion. first of all, the torsion is pro-
portional to the background ramond-ramond elds. indeed, the corresponding term in
the black string eective action violates parity. in the brane picture, parity turns black
string to anti-black string. it is the same as changing the sign of the ramond-ramond
elds. therefore, the torsion should be zero if the ramond-ramond elds are turned
o. also, we know that in at case the torsion is zero. indeed, the components of the
torsion along r4 are not allowed in at case because of so(4) invariance. the compo-
nents of the torsion along m0, tabc, are also zero for the following reason. in the at
case, the only ramond-ramond elds are the constant elds along the torus. we know
how they couple to our d1d5 system from supergravity. they couple to the topological
numbers. therefore, the corresponding contribution to the black string eective action
cannot change under the small deformations of the elds. in other words, these constant
ramond-ramond elds generate theta-angles in our sigma-model, but not torsion. now
we want to see what happens to the torsion when we put n  1 black strings at the origin
in r4. first of all, the components of the torsion along r4 become nonzero. for example,
d5 branes from the pile at the origin create brr, which couples to d1 from the single
black string. closer examination shows that tijk  n||z||2ijk and the other components
in r4 are zero. also, we should admit the possibility that the component tabr is not zero
any more. indeed, the ramond-ramond elds along t4 change when we move in radial
direction. this implies that theta-angles on m may change when we move in r4. this
precisely means that tabr 6= 0. on the other hand, we expect that tabc is still zero, or
at least very small when n  . ideed, we have seen that tabc is zero when we put
our black string in at background. the non-atness of the background can be locally
described by the gradient of the background elds, which we can schematically denote
 ( denotes the background elds). from the rotaional symmetry, and assuming the
analytic dependence of the torsion on the background elds, we estimate:

tabc  g

(38)

in other words, it is of the second order in the gradient of the background elds. therefore
we will neglect it. also, the other components of the torsion (for example, t i
ja, where i and
j are indices from the tangent space to s3) are zero because of the rotational symmetry
of r4.

now we want to consider the variation of the period map (the integrals of the kahler
forms over the two-cycles in m), when we move in radial direction. let us consider two
points, one at the distance r1 from the origin, and the other at the distance r2 (both on
the same line with the origin). consider the cycle c(r1) in m at the rst point, and the
same cycle c(r2) in m at the second point. we have, according to the stokes theorem,
(39)

rc(r2) i rc(r1) i = rci[r1,r2]

dx  dx  dxt 

[i]

15

the leading term on the right hand side is

z drzc(r)

da  dbt c

r[aib]c

(40)

we know that the space of periods over the ber of i+ coincides with that of i, modulo
small corrections. on the other hand, we see from (40) that the change in the periods
of i+ and the periods of i as we move along r is opposite. the only possibility to
reconcile these two observations is that t c
j j.
in any case, it follows that the space of periods does not depend on r.

r[aib]c is either zero or some combination ai

the condition

r[aib]c = linear combination of j
t c

(41)

is a restriction on the torsion. this restriction implies that the hyperkahler structure of
the ber does not depend on r. it is automatically satised when t c
ra is zero  in other
words, when the theta-angles on m(x) do not depend on the position in x  r4. we
believe that this is what actually happens:

t b
ra = 0

(42)

indeed, our analysis of supergravity solution shows that of eight ramond-ramond elds
on the torus, there are seven linear combinations which do not depend on r. it is natural
that the seven worldsheet theta-angles depend precisely on these seven combinations of
the ramond-ramond elds. we will check it in the case when the size of the torus is very
small at the end of section 5, using noncommutative geometry.

4 near horizon geometry.

in this section we will study the correspondence between the background elds far away
from the black string (we will call them asymptotic background) and the background
elds at the horizon. the answer is given by the formulas (52) and (54). we will explain
under which conditions two dierent asymptotic backgrounds ow to the same near-
horizon background (equations (56)). we will show that for each background there exists
a background with the small size torus which ows to the same near-horizon geometry.
to simplify the discussion, we will rst turn o the ramond-ramond uxes and study
only the perturbative moduli, parametrized by gr(4, 4 + 20). we will include ramond-
ramond elds at the end of this section. the correspondence between the ramond-
ramond uxes at innity and at the horizon is given by (63)

16

4.1 moduli of string perturbation theory.

according to [25] and [12] (and as reviewed in our appendix a), the plane w is generated
by the vectors ~v and v0, given by:

~v = (0, ~,b  ~),

v0 = (1, b, v 

b  b)

1
2

(43)

here ~ = (1, 2, 3) are the three kahler forms, v is the volume and b is the b eld.
now suppose that we are given the charge vector z:

z = (q4, q2, q0)

(44)

according to the previous section, the near-horizon geometry corresponds to the plane
w h = (w  z)  rz. let us describe this w h explicitly.
our torus is generated by i. let us consider the two-dimensional subspace

we begin with introducing a useful notation. the space 2

+t4 of self-dual forms on

c = {  2

+t4|((q2  q4b)  ) = 0}

(45)

we have denoted this space c for the following reason. as explained in [25], the choice
of the two-dimensional subspace in h 2(x, r) (where x is k3 or t4) is equivalent to the
choice of the complex structure up to sign (to x a sign, we have to orient the two-plane).
therefore, the charge vector z gives our torus a preferred complex structure modulo
sign, c. the orthogonal space to c in 2
+x is one-dimensional. therefore, there are
two ways to choose the kahler form, which dier by sign. the choice of the sign of the
kahler form also xes the sign of the complex structure. (in the case of torus this may
be understood as follows: we need the value of the kahler form on any tangent bivector
to any holomorphic surface to be positive). our preferred complex structure has a clear
geometrical meaning in the case when b = 0. in this case, the bound state of d1d5
may be described as instanton conguration on u(q4) gauge theory with the topological
charges (q2, q0). the corresponding eld strength is of the type (1, 1) in the complex
structure selected by the condition (q2 c) = 0. our denition (45) is the generalization
of this complex structure for b 6= 0.

now we describe w  z. this space contains a two-dimensional subspace

wc = {(0, ,(b  ))|  c}

(46)

since w  z is three-dimensional, we need one more vector. choose r  2
satises two conditions:

s =

4v

((q2  q4b)  r)

(48)

(49)

(50)

belongs to w  z. moreover, it is orthogonal to wc. therefore, w  z is generated
by the two-dimensional space wc and the vector vr. the near-horizon w h is generated
by this w  z and z. let us introduce the following linear combinations of vr and z:

vh
r =

q4vr  z
q||z||2 + q2
||z||2 + q2

4(2v + s2)
0 = ||z||2vr + q4(2v + s2)z
vh
4(2v + s2)

they are useful, because they are orthogonal to each other and wc, vh
r is of the form
(0,,) and ||vr||2 = 1, and vh
0 is of the form (1,,). it follows from the relation (43)
between the background elds and the plane w that the near-horizon kahler form, b
eld and volume are related to the components of vh
vh
r = (0, h
r,)
0 = (1, bh,)
vh
||vh
0||2 = 2v h

0 in the following way:

r and vh

(51)

near-horizon background as a function of background at innity.
this gives the following expressions for the near-horizon background elds in terms of

the asymptotic background elds:

2v h =

4(2v + s2)

||z||2 + q2
||z||2(2v + s2)

||z||2 + q2

4(2v + s2)

(52)

the sign of the square root is not xed (as we have explained before, the choice of the
sign of the kahler form corresponds to the choice of the sign of the complex structure).
one can see that the near-horizon background elds satisfy the attractor conditions:

q4bh  q2 =q||z||2  2q2

4v hh

r

18

(53)

which backgrounds at innity ow to the given near-horizon background?
let us now invert (52) and nd the backgrounds owing to the given attractor. the
condition (53) tells us that the near-horizon b-eld is expressed in terms of the near-
horizon volume and kahler form. therefore, it is natural to parametrize attractors by
(v h, h
c).
they may be parametrized by a real number s and the kahler form r. the b-eld, the
volume and the complex structure are determined from the following equations:

c). there is a twenty-parameter family of backgrounds owing to (v h, h

from the last of these relations we get a restriction on v :

||z||2  2q2

4v h v h

(54)

(55)

therefore, for any given attractor there is an upper limit on the volumes of the possible
tori at innity.

when two backgrounds at innity are equivalent?
we will call two backgrounds equivalent if they ow to the same background at the
horizon. our equivalence classes are 20-dimensional subspaces in gr(4, 4 + 20) in case
of k3, or 4-dimensional subspaces in gr(4, 4 + 4) in case of t4. indeed, given a space
w  z, we need to specify a single line in r4,20/(w  z), in order to specify w .
therefore, the equivalence class is itself a grassmanian manifold, gr(1, 1 + 20). the
space of equivalence classes is also a grassmanian, gr(3, 3 + 20). it follows from (52) or
(54) that for the background with parameters b, i to be equivalent to the background
b, , we have to have:

1) complex structures are the same,
2) b + sr = b + sr,

3) v  +

(s)2

2

= v +

s2
2

(56)

(apriori, the complex structures are the same modulo sign. but since the equivalence
classes are connected, it is natural to choose the sign to be the same.) the third condition
follows from the rst two and the denition (49) of s, therefore we have in total 40+20 = 60
conditions for x = k3, or 8 + 4 = 12 for t4. (this is the dimension of gr(3, 3 + 20) or
gr(3, 3 + 4), respectively.)

19

two examples.
1) as a consistency check, let us see what happens when v >> 1. in this case, the

near-horizon plane w h is generated by the vectors:
r  (0, r, 0), vh

vh
c = (0, c, 0), vh

0  (1, q2/q4, q0/q4)

(57)

this plane does not depend on b. therefore, for the large volume torus the moduli space
of instantons does not depend on b. this is what we expect. indeed, in this limit we
expect that the system is described by the modied six-dimensional yang-mills action:

sb = const +

1

gstr z tr (f  b)2d6x

(58)

the corresponding equations of motion do not depend on b, and the moduli space of
solutions is the same as for b = 0.

2) now consider the equivalence of backgrounds with very small torus, v = v  = 0.
then, we have simply s = s. this allows us to rewrite the equivalence conditions in
somewhat simpler form. namely, the two small tori are equivalent if and only if:

1) they have the same complex structure

r, 0

(r  (q2  q4b))
||q2  q4b||2  ||z||2 (q2  q4b)

2) they have the same two-form r  2
each equivalence class contains small tori.
given the torus of the nite size, it is easy to nd the corresponding family of small
tori. let us denote the background elds for the nite size torus (b, r, c), and the
background elds for the small tori (b0, 0
c). from the last of equations (56), we
express s0 for the family of small tori in terms of the volume and s for our nite size
torus:

s0 = 2v + s2
our family of small tori can be parametrized by 0
r, which is constrained to be orthogonal
c = c. the eld b0 is found from the second equation in (56) which tells us that
to 0
b0 + s00
r)
satisfy the second of (56), and s is related to (r, b, v ) by the formula (49), then s0 is
r, b0, v 0 = 0) by the same formula (49)). we see that, indeed, there are
also related to (0
small tori in each equaivalence class. this allows us to describe the dynamics of branes
wrapped on nite torus in terms of branes wrapped on small torus. the latter is related
to the noncommutative geometry, as reviewed in the next section.

r is equal to b + sr. (if s0 is related to s by the last of eqs. (56) and (b0, 0

(59)

(60)

4.2 turning on the ramond-ramond elds.

now we want to include the ramond-ramond uxes. we will use the notation for the
vectors in r5,21 which is explained at the end of appendix a. we want to answer the

20

question: what are the near-horizon rr uxes, given the rr uxes at innity? consider
the plane w  corresponding to the background at innity. it is generated by ve vectors
the fth of which is:

v5 = [(c0, c2, c4), (1, 2 

1
2||c||2)]

let us denote w 4
vector

the plane generated by the rst four vectors v0, . . . , v3. consider the

h = v5 
v5
2 , c h

(v5  z)
||pw 
h  1

4 z
4 z||2 pw 
2||c||2)], where c h

h = [(c h

0 , c h

4 ), (1, 2

we claim that v5
i and h are the near-
horizon values of the ramond-ramond uxes and the six-dimensional string coupling
constant. let us prove it. the subspace w 4  w  consists of vectors of the form:
[(,,), (0,)]. we can characterize v5 as the vector of the form [(,,), (1,)], with the
conditions v5  w and v5  w4. the vector v5
h dened in (62) belongs to w z. since
w  z is constant, v5 also belongs to the near-horizon ve-plane, w h. because of the
attractor condition, w h contains z. since we do not consider vebranes and fundamental
strings, the last two components of z are zero. therefore z belongs to the near-horizon
4 . also, notice that w 4  z is three-dimensional. now it follows,
four-plane, z  w h
that the near-horizon w h
4 is generated by z and w 4  z. besides being orthogonal to
z, our vector v5
h is also orthogonal to w 4  z (indeed, v5 is orthogonal to w 4 and
4 . also, it is clearly
pw 
of the form [(,,), (1,)]. because of our characterization of v5, these properties imply
that the vector v5

4 z is orthogonal to w 4  z). therefore, v5

h dened in (62) is, indeed, the near-horizon v5.
straightforward computation using (62) gives (when v = 0):

h is orthogonal to w h

c h
0 = c0 + t,
c h
2 = c2  tb,
c h
4 = c4 +

t
2||b||2

(61)

(62)

(63)

(64)

where we have denoted:

t = q0c0 + q4c4 + (q2  c2)
2 q4||b||2

q0 + (q2  b)  1

one can check that the total ux of the near-horizon rr elds through our branes is zero:

 q0c h

0 + q4c h

4 + (q2  c h

2 ) = 0

(65)

this is the attractor condition for the ramond-ramond elds. the relation (63) be-
tween the asymptotic and the near-horizon values of the ramond-ramond elds may be
rewritten in terms of c = c0 + c2 + c4:

c h = c + teb

21

(66)

notice that the expressions (63) for c h
i do not involve r (when v = 0). it has been
shown in [12], that the near-horizon values of the ramond-ramond uxes correspond to
the uxes of the b-elds in the sigma-model on the moduli space of instantons. in other
words, they are the theta-angles of the instanton sigma-model. when b = 0, (63) tells us
that these theta-angles depend only on c2 and c4. intuitively, that this is what we would
expect. indeed, after t duality c4 becomes c0  the new rr zero-form, and c2 becomes
(c2). our q4 becomes instanton number, and q0 becomes the rank of the gauge group.
the interaction with the rr uxes for the 1 + 5 dimensional theory is of the form:

z c2  tr f  f +z c4 tr f  f  f

(67)

(here f is the six-dimensional eld strength). after dimensional reduction to 1 + 1
dimensions, this gives the following terms, corresponding to theta-angles:

z c2  tr da  da +z c4 tr f  da  da

(68)

(we write this expression rather schematically.) as for the ramond-ramond zero-form
c0, it will couple only to the u(1) gauge eld, which decouples from the other elds and
does not participate in the dual description of the ads supergravity. the topological

5 relation to the noncommutative torus.

5.1 small torus and noncommutative torus (a very brief re-

view).

there is a beautiful relation between the noncommutative geometry and the compacti-
cation of the string theory on the torus of very small size. we will not review it here,
since it is thoroughly explained in [1, 2, 3]. but we will give a very brief description of
this correspondence, in order to x our notations. consider the compactication of the
type iia string theory on the small torus t4 with the metric gij and the b-eld bij.
consider n d0 branes in this background. suppose that the size of the torus is much
less than the string length. consider rst the case bij = 0. making t duality in all the
four directions of the torus, we get the theory of n d4 branes on the dual torus (which
has very large size). according to [26], the low energy worldsheet theory for these d4
branes is n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills. now let us turn on some very small b eld.
(in our notations, b eld is dimensionless; for the string worldsheet wrapping the cycle
(ij) of the torus, the b eld gives the phase factor e2ibij in the path integral). since b
is small, we expect that it does not considerably change the dynamics of d0 branes. the
eect of the small b eld is some small correction to n = 4 sym on t4. it turns out,

22

that this correction is precisely turning on the noncommutativity parameter. moreover,
this result holds for arbitrary bij, not necessarily small.

the precise correspondence goes as follows. the noncommutative torus is dened in
terms of the algebra of functions on it (see [29] and references therein for details). this
is the noncommutative deformation of the algebra of functions on the usual torus.
if
we denote i the coordinates on the torus, then the algebra of functions is generated by
eij for j = 1, . . . , 4. the algebra of functions on the noncommutative torus may also be
thought of as generated by eij , but instead of eij eik = eikeij we have:

eij eik = e2ijk eikeij

the bivector ij is called the noncommutativity parameter. this denes the noncommu-
tative torus as a manifold. to dene the yang-mills functional, we have also to specify
the metric. it is done in the following way. one introduces a four-dimensional abelian
algebra, acting on the algebra of functions as derivations. this algebra is the analogue
of the algebra of constant vector elds on the commutative torus. it remains abelian in
the noncommutative case. the metric on the noncommutative torus is dened as the
metric gij on this algebra (as on the linear space). we have the following correspon-
dence between the parameters of the string theory torus t4 and the parameters of the

noncommutative torus ft4:

ij = bij, gij = (g1)ij

(69)

the relation between these formulas and the eective open string metric/noncommutativity
parameter of [3] is the following. the eective open string metric and noncommutativity
parameter are given by eq. (2.5) of [3]:

gij =  1

g + b!ij

suppose that we are given the background with the metric gij and the b-eld bij. first,
we do the t-duality g + b  1
the noncommutative yang-mills theory goes as follows. for a two-form  = 1
let us denote  the two-form on the dual torus with the components ()ij = 1
for the noncommutative yang-mills, there is the following relation in cohomology:

indeed, it is known from mathematical literature [30] that the right hand side of (71)
is integer. to x the relation between the components of  and the charge z, we can
consider the case b = 0. after t duality, c = c0 + c2 + c4 goes to

(73)
(it follows from (123) and (124); t duality acts on 4,4 as (x, v, y)  (y, v, x)). we use
the coupling to the ramond-ramond elds to nd :

c = c4 + c2  c0

this implies (72). in particular, we have the following relations in cohomology:

z c   = q0c0 + (q2  c2) + q4c4

also notice that for the geometrically dual torus, the kahler forms are related to the
kahler forms of the original torus as follows:

i 7 (i)

in our situation, we have type iib q0 d1, q2 d3 and q4 d5 branes. in this case, we get

the ve-dimensional u(q0) theory on r1,1  ft4, where r1,1 is commutative. (we may

consider this as a particular case of the six-dimensional noncommutative yang-mills, with
the noncommutativity bivector  vanishing when one of its indices is in the tangent
space to r1,1.) dimensional reduction of this theory on the four-torus gives the sigma-

model with the target space the moduli space of instantons on ft4.

as an example of how this correspondence works, let us compute the tension of the
black string in the limit of the small size torus. from the solution (17), we see that the
tension is:

at small v , we have:

t =

where  is the sign of ||z||2  ||q2  q4b||2 and ev = (v )1. the rst term is leading
when v   0. the second term after identications (69) and (72) is proportional to the
action of the noncommutative instanton, found in [28].
now we are in a position to give a formula, relating the near-horizon geometry to the
noncommutative torus. first, we look at which small size tori at innity ow to the given
torus at the horizon. we use (54) with v = 0. the third of relations (54) expresses s in
terms of v h. substituting this s to the second equation, we get the relation between b
and r. we have:

c = h

(79)

these relations determine the family of small tori, which ow to our attractor. this
family is parametrized by r. each of these small tori determines the noncommutative
torus, which is geometrically dual to it, with the noncommutativity parameter  = b.
therefore, to the given attractor we associate the family of noncommutative tori. this
family is characterized by the xed complex structure and the following relation between
the kahler form and the noncommutativity parameter:

(here we have used  instead of z). the formula (80) gives the answer to the ques-
tion: which noncommutative torus corresponds to the ads background with parameters
r, v h, bh)? we see that the answer is not unique. it follows that all the tori from
(h
the family (80) have the same moduli space of noncommutative instantons.

c, h

since the parameters of the attractor are unambiguously determined by the param-
eters of the small torus (b, r, c), we can rewrite the equations (80) for the family of
noncommutative tori so that it does not contain the parameters of the attractor. indeed,
rewriting (59) in terms of  and (, i), we get:

1) c = const (modulo phase)
(r  (2  4))
||2  4||2  ||||2 (2  4) = const

2) r  2

(81)

the form 2  4 is expressed in terms of trf in (75). it would be interesting to prove
in noncommutative geometry, that all the noncommutative tori from the family (81) have
the same moduli space of instantons with instanton number .

25

he equations (81) imply that the self-dual part of the form

2  4

||2  4||2  ||||2

(82)

is a covariantly constant section of the restriction of the universal bundle 2
self-dual forms on the family of equivalent tori.

notice that for small noncommutativity and 2 = 0, the second equation (81) implies
that: 1) r is constant and 2) the self-dual part of  is constant. this is what we
intuitively expect. indeed, in the limit of almost commutative torus there are large regions
in the moduli space, where some instantons become very small. but very small instantons
on zero volume t4 is almost the same as instantons on r4. according to [3], the moduli
space of instantons on r4 depends only on the self-dual part of the noncommutativity
parameter. some properties of supersymmetric congurations on r4 are discussed in the
next subsection.

+et4 of

5.2 supersymmetric congurations on r4.

it was conjectured in [5, 31] that the supersymmetric congurations on r4 with nonzero
b eld are noncommutative instantons. this was has been proven in [3] in the zero-slope
limit, that is when   0. we want to show that this is true beyond the zero slope limit.
the zero slope limit may be characterized by:

notice that

()2gikgjlbijbkl 

1


>> 1

()2gikgjlbijbkl =

1
()2 gikgjlijkl

(83)

(84)

(this follows from the formula (70) for the eective open string metric and noncommuta-
tivity parameter).

we will argue that the moduli space of supersymmetric congurations depends only
on certain combination of metric and b eld, and that for the background with generic
g and b we can always nd the background which gives the same moduli space of super-
symmetric congurations and satises the zero slope condition. let us prove it. suppose
that we are given the generic metric and b eld on r4, not necessarily satisfying (83).
the moduli space of supersymmetric congurations should not change signicantly if we
replace our r4 by suciently large torus. (we will make this statement more precise
below). this torus will have very large volume and very large b-eld (in fact, for generic
background the b-eld will scale like the square root of the volume). the target space
of the sigma-model describing the low energy dynamics of d1d5 system wrapped on this
torus is the moduli space of supersymmetric congurations on this torus. for nite values
of charges, it has a region corresponding to supersymmetric congurations on r4. indeed,

26

for very large torus we expect to have such eld congurations that the eld strength is
localized in the small region of the torus which may be thought of as r4 with nontrivial
b eld. we will call such eld congurations localized. since we have gij  bij, these
eld congurations do not satisfy the condition of the zero slope limit. we want to argue,
however, that our large torus is equivalent to the torus with |gij| << |bij|, for which
the localized supersymmetric congurations do satisfy the zero slope condition. let us
show it. it is very convenient to do rst the t duality g + b  1
g+b which gives us the
torus with small gij and bij. the metric and the b eld are, still, of the same order of
magnitude. in other words, we have:

||b||2  v << 1, q0  q4

(85)

(and we put q2 = 0). although volume is small, it is nite. as we have argued in the
previous section, we can always nd an equivalent torus which has zero volume. the
kahler form 0

r and the b-eld b0 for that equivalent torus satisfy:

b0 + s00

r = b + sr

(86)

(87)

where

s0 = 2v + s2, s 

q0
q4

1

(b  r)

(we have used an equation (49) for s in the regime (85)). since s >> 1 and v << 1 we
have:

then, (86) is satised by:

s0 = s + o(v /s)

0
r = r, b0 = b + o(v /s)  b

(88)

(89)

(the correction for b is much smaller then b itself). we see that the torus with small
v and b satisfying (85) is equivalent to the zero volume torus, which has the same
shape and the same (small) b eld.
(of course, we can take any other zero volume
torus with the same shape and the same self-dual part of the b eld). in terms of the
t-dual torus (gij, bij) with large gij and bij (the one we have started with) this means
that it is equivalent to the zero size torus with large b-eld bij. however, the relation
between the shape of this equivalent torus and the shape of gij, as well as the relation
between b and b is more complicated. in fact, it is very simple in terms of the eective
open string metric and the noncommutativity parameter. namely, the noncommutative
torus (gij, ij) with small ij and gikgjlijkl  ()2 is equivalent to the very large
noncommutative torus (gij = ) with the same shape and the same noncommutativity
parameter. the corresponding moduli space is just the moduli space of instantons on
large noncommutative t4 and the region in the moduli space corresponding to localized
eld congurations is the moduli space of instantons on noncommutative r4.

27

let us summarize what we have. we have started with the torus of the large size
and large b-eld. we have argued that there are localized eld congurations, which
are the same as supersymmetric congurations on r4 with the b eld. on the other
hand, we have proven that the moduli space of supersymmetric congrations on this
torus is the same as the moduli space of supersymmetric congurations on the small size
torus with some other b eld (which is also large). this moduli space also has a region
corresponding to localized congurations. it is a natural conjecture (we did not prove it)
that the localized supersymmetric eld congurations on the large torus correspond to the
localized congurations on the equivalent small torus. but the localized congurations
on the small torus are described by the zero slope limit, and therefore they are instantons
on the noncommutative r4.

this shows that the moduli space of supersymmetric congurations on r4 does not

depend on .

5.3 wilson lines.

the moduli space of anti-self-dual connections on t4 has an obvious u(1)4 symmetry:

i  i + iai

(90)

where ai are real numbers. this symmetry does not have xed points. therefore, the
moduli space has a structure of a bundle with the ber four-torus t4. in the commutative
case (when b = 0) we could identify this t4 with the dual to the torus on which our
yang-mills elds live. in the noncommutative case we expect more subtle relation between
these tori. one way to see it is to notice that the periodic identications ai  ai + 2
result from the gauge transformations, which are modied for the noncommutative torus.
the gauge transformation with the parameter e2ii would not just change ai  ai + 2i,
but will instead add some nontrivial function of 1 and 2 to i. shifting ai by constant
will require more complicated gauge transformation, and the periodicity properties of the
wilson lines will be changed. we expect that the torus t4, parametrizing the wilson
lines, will be dierent from the geometrically dual to t4. notice that in the presence of
the b eld, the shape of the torus t4 depends on the representative in the equivalence
class of backgrounds. therefore, if t4 was just geometrically dual to t4, we would get
non-equivalent sigma-models for equivalent backgrounds. in fact, we know from section
4 that c and b + sr are invariants of the equivalence relation. therefore, it is natural
to conjecture that the hyperkahler structure on the moduli space of at connections
in the bundle with the given (q4, q2, q0) is specied by the forms re c, im c and
where r is given by the second line in (81). we do not know how to prove it in

r|| r||2

noncommutative geometry.

5.4 possible singularities in the moduli space.

if the instanton moduli space for one of the tori from the family (81) has singularities,
then all the tori from this family have singular instanton moduli spaces. singularities of
the instanton moduli spaces are related in string theory to the possibility for the system of
branes to split into two or more subsystems preserving the bps condition. the conditions
for the possibility of the decay of the black string have been worked out in [27]. the answer
is the following. for the black string with the charge z in the background w to be able
to decay into two string, one with the charge z1 and the other with the charge z  z1, it
is necessary that the projection (z1)+ of z1 on w and the projection z+ of z on w are
collinear vectors. this means, that w  z1 = w  z. in other words, w  z should
be orthogonal to z1. therefore, singularity or nonsingularity depends only on z  w .
but our denition of equivalent tori is precisely that they have the same z  w .
we get the simplest example of the singular moduli space, if we take q2 = 0, b
antiselfdual, and turn o the ramond-ramond elds. in this situation, (b  ) = 0 (this
is the denition of b being antiselfdual), and the plane w  z is generated by the three
vectors [(0, i, 0), (0, 0)] together with the fourth vector [(0, 0, 0), (1, 2)]. we see that the
whole lattice 1,1 generated by the integer vectors of the form [(, 0,), (0, 0)] is orthogonal
to wz. therefore, our (q4, q0) system may decay into (q4, q0) and (q4q4, q0q0),
provided that q4q0 > 0 and (q4  q4)(q0  q0) > 0. the corresponding singularity
in the moduli space of instantons is due to small instantons. notice that if we turn on
the generic ramond-ramond elds, then the separation of branes becomes impossible.
therefore, although the moduli space of instantons remains geometrically singular, the
conformal sigma-model is nonsingular. the reason is, of course, that we have turned on
theta-angles.

it is not true that an arbitrary background with singular instanton moduli space is
related to this example by dualities. indeed, it can happen that the sublattice orthogonal
to w  z is not 1,1 (and has dimension higher then two). then, the corresponding
singularity cannot be related to the small instantons by the chain of dualities.

5.5 theta-angles.

now we want to explain from the point of view of the noncommutative geometry the
theta-angles of the d1d5 sigma-model. the ramond-ramond background elds couple
to the topological densities of the yang-mills elds on the noncommutative manifold

r1,1  ft4. this coupling can be derived from the coupling of the rr elds to d-branes.
let us rst discuss this coupling in the case if we wrap euclidean d-branes on t6, and
then take the limit of very large t2  t6. suppose that we have started with euclidean
d1/d3/d4 wrapped on t6, so that they all have common t2 and the orthogonal t4 is
very small. we turn on b elds and rr elds along this small t4 (and take the elds
with at least one component along t2 all zero). to study this system, we pass to the

29

dual large noncommutative et4. the coupling of the rr elds to the yang-mills elds on
t2  ft4 is

srr = c  t6 = c  e(cid:20)tr exp(cid:18) 1
= (e  c)  tr exp(cid:18) 1

f(cid:19)(cid:21) =
f(cid:19)
f(cid:19) = a  tr exp(cid:18) 1

(91)

2i

2i

2i

in this formula, c is given by (73), t6 is the integer vector dening the topology of the
yang-mills elds on t6 and f is the eld strength of the noncommutaive yang-mills on

t6. the forms a and c are dened in appendix a. now we want to pass to r2  et4
by making t2 very large, much larger then et4. the low energy theory is a dimensional
reduction of the six-dimensional yang-mills on et4. this theory lives on an ordinary,

commutative two-torus. however, it does remember, in a way, that it was obtained from
the reduction on the noncommutative manifold. namely, it turns out that the integral
along this torus of tr f is not integer. this follows from the formula

derived in [30]. for the worldsheet instanton,  has two components along t2, and two or

formula (91) for the coupling to the rr elds.

four components along ft4. its contraction with the noncommutativity parameter gives
the appearence of noninteger r tr fz z may seem strange, and we want to make a
comment about it. let us consider the following example. take our noncommutative
torus t4 as a product of two noncommutative tori t2
(2), with the noncommutativity
parameters 1 and 2. let us consider an instanton with rt2t2
f  f 6= 0 (the rst
t2 in the product t2  t2
(1) is the commutative torus). in the adiabatic limit (when the
size of t2 is much larger then the size of t2
(1)) this conguration may be thought of as
wrapping the large (and commutative) t2 on the nontrivial two-cycle in the moduli space
of at connections in t2
(1) (see [32]). naively it seems that we can just put az and az
equal to zero, which would clearly give fz z = 0, and no ux. however, there is a subtlety
here.
in fact, we have to consider at connections modulo the gauge transformations.
and it is not true that for our map from t2 to the moduli space of at connections on
t2
(1) we can globally choose the representative in the gauge equivalence class smoothly
depending on the point in t2. therefore, we should really cover our t2 with patches and
construct separately the family of at connections on t2
(1) over each patch, and then glue
them together by the appropriate gauge transformations. these gauge transformations
can make it impossible to choose az = 0 and az = 0.
in the case if the small torus
is noncommutative, we have an additional complications, because our elds a are not
really gauge elds, but noncommutative gauge elds. that is, they have non-standard
gauge transformations. in fact, non-commutative gauge elds can be expressed in terms
of the ordinary gauge elds, as explained in [3]. the formula to the rst order in the

30

noncommutativity parameter is:

1
4

kl(ak(lai + fli) + (lai + fli)ak)

(93)

cai = ai 

the corresponding noncommutative eld strength is, in our case:

this expression shows that fz z cannot be taken to be zero. the noncommutative instanton

ij [2(fzifzj + fzjfzi  (ai(jfz z + jfz z) + (jfz z + jfz z)ai))]

dfz z = fz z +
is the deformation of the conguration with r f  f = 82ninst and rt2 f = 0. in this

topological sector, we can take fz z = 0. then,

tr fz z =

which is in agreement with (92).

0 , c h

2 , c h

now let us see what happens when we replace t2 by r2, that is, consider our original
conguration of d1d5 wrapped on t4 and with two common noncompact directions. in
this case, the ux of tr f through r2 is not determined by the topology. the conguration
with zero tr fz z minimizes the action. therefore, in this case the ux of tr f through r2
is zero. this implies, that the coupling to the ramond-ramond elds becomes dierent
from (91). in fact, putting trfz z  0 in (91) is equivalent to replacing (c0, c2, c4) by
(c h
4 ), given by the formula (63). let us prove it. we will consider the formula
(91) valid for the theory on the six-torus, but put the diagonal part of the components of
tr 1rt2 trf(cid:17)  where  is
f along t2 equal to zero. in other words, replace f with f (cid:16) 1
the fundamental cohomology class of t2, rt2  = 1. we will get:

c  t6 exp"rt2 trf
# =zt6 c  t6  c  t6  rt6 trf

let us compare this expression with what we would get by replacing c  c h:

substituting t from (64) and taking into account (75) we see that (96) is equal to (97).
this means that sigma-model on r2 couples to the ramond-ramond elds only through

31

their near-horizon values. this explains, from the point of view of the noncommutative
geometry, why the theta-angles depend only on the near-horizon values of the ramond-
ramond background elds.

6 sigma-model instantons and supergravity instan-

tons.

in this section we want to discuss the supergravity meaning of the period map. the
period map associates to each hyperkahler manifold the space of integrals (periods) over
its two-cycles of the three kahler forms. given the period map of the target space, one can
immediately compute the action of any sigma-model instanton. indeed, the corresponding
map f : r2  m from the wordsheet to the target space should be holomorphic in some
complex structure and the action is given by

s =vuut

3xi=1(cid:18)zr2

fi(cid:19)2

(98)

but the integrals over the worldsheet of the pullbacks of the kahler forms is given in terms
of the period map and the topology of the instanton. more exactly, let us introduce the
cohomology lattice h 2(m, z). there is a natural nondegenerate pairing on this lattice
(the construction is reviewed in [12]). the topology of the sigma-model instanton can be
specied by giving a vector z  h 2(m, q), so that the integral of p  h 2(m, z) over the
worldsheet equals (zp). the period map gives us a three-plane w model
 rh 2(m, z),
and the action of the instanton is

3

s =q||pw model

3

z||2

(99)

we want to interpret this formula in supergravity. our sigma-model arises on the world-
volume of the d1d5 system wrapped on t4. let us consider the d1d5 system with
the worldvolume not r2, but some compact riemann surface  (for example, s2). of
course, this system will not be bps and therefore will presumably collapse and decay into
gravitons and other elds of six-dimensional supergravity. but let us consider the case
when we have nontrivial instanton charge on . this instanton charge will couple to the
ramond-ramond background elds, and therefore it cannot decay into the states from
the perturbative string spectrum. in fact it decays into some perturbative state plus one
of the d-instantons of the six-dimensional sueprgravity, such as type iib d-instanton, or
type iib euclidean d-string wrapped on the two-cycle in t4, or type iib euclidean d3
brane wrapped on t4, or a combination of them. therefore, we can think of d-instantons
as black strings with compact worldsheet wrapping a nontrivial cycle in the target space.
do we expect the action of these supergravity instantons to be equal to the action
of the corresponding instantons in our sigma-model? for generic backgrounds, we do

32

not. one reason is that we expect the sigma-model description to break down for small
enough worldsheets. but even if we forget about the possible breakdown of the low energy
description, there is still a reason why the action of supergravity instantons is dierent.
as we have explained in section 5.3, the sigma-model instanton on r2 usually has nonzero
abelian gauge eld strength on r2, determined from minimizing the action. in generic
situation, the ux of this gauge eld through r2 is non-integer. if we want to compactify
r2 to s2 or any other riemann surface, we have to change the two-dimensional abelian
gauge eld so that the ux is integer. this will increase the action. therefore, we expect
that in the generic background, the actions of the supergravity instantons are dierent
from the actions of the sigma-model instantons.

however, for some special backgrounds and instanton charges, the ux of the abelian
eld happens to be zero. the condition for it is that the coupling of the instanton to
(c0, c2, c4) is the same as the coupling to (c h
4 ). in other words, the charge  of
the supergravity instanton, dened so that the phase factor is e2i(c), satises:

0 , c h

2 , c h

(pw4z  ) = 0

(100)

we will see that this condition has a natural interpretation in supergravity. we will argue
that if this condition is satised (together with some other conditions) then the action of
supergravity instanton is equal to the action of the sigma-model instanton.

6.1 can supergravity instantons be absorbed by branes?

we will argue that under certain conditions (including (100)) there exists the solution of
the euclidean six-dimensional supergravity, corresponding to the black string with the
worldsheet r2 and d-instanton at some distance from it. this solution preserves four
real supercharges. it has moduli, corresponding to the motion of the d-instanton in the
space transverse to the black string. the action does not depend on the position of the
d-instanton. it is possible that such a d-instanton can approach our black string and
dissolve into it, becoming a sigma-model instanton, and that the action is not changed
in this process. for example, we may consider the black string which is obtained by
wrapping n > 1 type iib d3 branes on some two-cycle of the torus.
if we turn o
the b-eld on the torus, then introducing a d1-brane will leave eight supersymmetries
unbroken. the d1-brane can move in the directions transversal to n d3, or it can
become an instanton on the worldvolume of n d3. from the point of view of yang-mills
on the worldvolume of the threebranes, we can describe this process as follows. the d1
brane on top of n d3 branes may be thought of as point-like instanton. this point-like
instanton corresponds to the special point in the moduli space of instantons of su(n)
theory. moving in the moduli space, we deform it to the nite size instanton, which can
be described as a classical supersymmetric eld conguration on the worldsheet.

we should stress, however, that it is not always true that the supersymmetric cong-
uration of the supergravity instanton and the d-brane can be represented as a classical

33

instanton on the worldvolume of the d-brane. for example, the conguration consisting
of a single d3 brane and a d-instanton on top of it is supersymmetric; nevertheless, there
are no nite size instantons in the u(1) gauge theory living on the worldvolume of the
single d3 brane. for our conguration of black string and instanton, we do not know
whether instanton can really be represented by the worldsheet eld conguration3. we
can probably say that it is an ideal instanton, represented by the singular elds, but
the precise meaning of this statement is not very clear.

to prove the connection between the supergravity instantons and the sigma-model
instantons, we should answer two questions. the rst question is whether the supergrav-
ity instanton sitting on top of the brane can be deformed to the smooth supersymmetric
solution of the six-dimensional yang-mills equations. in other words, whether the cor-
responding singular eld conguration is just a point on the boundary space of smooth
congurations. the second question is whether this smooth six-dimensional solution (if it
exists) has a good limit when we shrink t4 to zero size; if yes, then it should correspond
to the instanton of the d1d5 sigma-model.

we did not prove that the answers to these two questions are positive. we want to
give an example which shows that at least the rst assumption is true for some instan-
tons. some supersymmetric solutions of six-dimensional yang-mills theory on calabi-yau
threefold were obtained (in the language of complex geometry) in [37]. our example is
analogous to the solutions found in that paper.

consider type iib compactifyed on a six-torus t6 = t2 t4. introduce the following
brane conguration. take n d3 branes wrapped on t4 and one d3 brane wrapped on
t2   where   h2(t4, z), ||||2 > 0. the four-torus t4 with a given metric admits
a family of complex structures parametrized by s2. we can choose one of these complex
structures so that the cohomology class poincare-dual to  (which we will call []) is of
the type (1, 1). then, there are holomorphic line bundles on t4 whose chern class is [].
let us choose one of them and call it l. the other bundles with the same chern class
may be obtained from this one by shifts in t4. it is proven in chapter 2.6 of [38] that

dim h 0(t4,l) = ||||2

2

zeroes of the global sections of l are holomorphic curves representing . fixing one partic-
ular bundle corresponds to xing two out of ||||2
2 + 1 complex moduli of such holomorphic
2 = h 0(m,l).
curves. let us parametrize the global sections of l by the vectors v  c
we will denote the corresponding sections [v](x1, x2), where x1 and x2 are the local
complex coordinates on t4. our conguration of d3 branes can be represented by the

||||2

3supersymmetric solutions of yang-mills equations on six-dimensional manifolds have been studied
in [33, 34, 35, 36] and references therein. for these solutions, the eld strength should belong to su(3) 
su(4) = so(6) modulo constant. (the variation of fermion with nonzero constant eld strength can be
compensated by the  transformation, as explained in [3].)

34

following equation in t6 = t2  t4:

f0(x1, x2, x, y) def= [v0](x1, x2)(a0 + a1x + a2y + . . . + an xn/2) = 0

(101)

here (x, y) is the point of t2 described by the weierstrass equation y2 = x3 + ax + b. if
2 y. this equation represents a union of n d3 branes
n is odd, then the last term is x
wrapping t4 and the single d3 brane wrapping t2. it preserves 1
8 of supersymmetries.
one can think of this equation as specifying a single complex surface in t6, but then this
surface is singular. to make it nonsingular, we consider a deformation of (101) specifyied
by the choice of

n3

this deformation is:

[u0, . . . , un ]  p(cn +1  h 0(t4,l))

f [u0, . . . , un ](x1, x2, x, y) =
= [u0](x1, x2) + [u1](x1, x2)x + [u2](x1, x2)y + . . . = 0

(102)

(103)

in particular, f [a0v0, . . . , an vn ] = f0. unlike the initial equation (101), it represents a
smooth four-surface x[u0, . . . , un ] in t6. this smooth four-surface belongs to the same
homology class n[t4] +  [t2] as the original singular surface (101). let us now assume
that n is even and  is divisible by two. then, the chern class of the normal bundle
to x is divisible by two, and x is a spin manifold. therefore, we can wrap a euclidean
three-brane on it [39, 40]. let us take n > 1 such d3 branes on top of each other and put
k su(n) instantons on their world-volume (the corresponding smooth eld conguration
exists for large enough k [41]).

after making t-duality in both directions of t2, we get a system of nn d5 branes
with nontrivial eld conguration on it. since the initial eld conguration was nonsin-
gular, we should get nonsingular conguration after t-duality. the brane charge of this
conguration is

nn[t6] + k 

n||||2

8

! [t4] + n[t2]  

the term n||||2
appears because x has notrivial topology, and therefore our d3 brane
couples to axion even if we turn o the world-volume gauge elds. namely, the d-instanton
charge induced by the nontrivial topology of x is

this example demonstrates that at least some congurations exist as smooth solutions
on the brane worldvolume. however, the conguration which we considered is obviously
not the most generic one. the most serious restriction in this example is that

zt6

trf  f  f = 0

35

(this is what allowed us to reduce dimension from six to four by doing t duality). also,
we did not prove that turning on the b eld will not destroy our conguration.

in the remaining part of this section we will just assume that supergravity instantons
correspond to smooth eld congurations and are well described by the d1d5 sigma-
model, and see what this assumption impies.

6.2 classication of instantons in six-dimensional supergravity.

the simplest instanton to consider is the d1-instanton, which is the dimensional reduc-
tion of the d-instanton in ten-dimensional type iib. its action is

sd1 = c0 

i
gstr

(104)

the real part of this action is the phase associated to the instanton. it is equal to the
expectation value of the axion eld. in the classical low energy supergravity, we have a
symmetry c0  c0 + const. this symmetry is a subgroup r1 of so(5, 5, r). but the
higher derivative corrections to the low energy action do not have such a symmetry. the
reason is precisely the contribution of the d1-instantons, which carry a phase depending
on c0. now we want to consider more general instantons. notice that a subgroup r1 
so(5, 5, r) consisting of the shifts of axion, can be represented in terms of the light-like
vector v  r  5,5, and the orthogonal vector   v/v. indeed, let us consider the
following v and :

v = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1)]
 = [(1, 0, 0), (0, 0)]

(105)

one can check that the one-parametric group of transformations tv,(t)  so(5, 5, r)
acting on vectors x  r  5,5 in the following way:

(106)

tv,(t)x = x + t(cid:20)(  x)v  (v  x)(cid:18) +

t

2||||2v(cid:19)(cid:21)

is precisely the group of shifts of c0. we can consider arbitrary pairs (v, )  5,5, such
that v is lightlike and  is orthogonal to it. any pair (v, ) species the r-subgroup of
so(5, 5, r), and there is a corresponding instanton breaking this symmetry. to nd the
action of this instanton, we have just to rewrite (104) in terms of v and :

s =

(  pw v)

||pw v||2  ivuut||pwv||2

||pw v||2

(107)

invariance under u-duality group so(5, 5, z) implies that (107) gives the action of the six-
dimensional instanton for an arbitrary pair (v, ). although the d1-instanton we have
started with was somewhat special because the corresponding vector  was null-vector,

36

the expression (107) is valid for all d-instantons. indeed, let us consider the conguration
consisting of q3 euclidean d3-branes wrapped on t4, and q1 d1-instantons. if the b-
eld on the torus is anti-self-dual, this action for this conguration is the sum of the action
of q1 d1-instantons and q3 euclidean d3-branes. this is in agreement with (107).
the backgrounds with generic b-eld may be obtained from this one by the rotation by
the element of so(4, 4, r) preserving the vector  = (q3, 0, q1). the formula (107) is
invariant under such rotations. this means that (107) is valid for an arbitrary  of the
form (q3, 0, q1). but any other primitive vector in the lattice 4,4 is equivalent to one
of these.

we will actually consider only d-instantons, therefore all that we need is (99) for

v = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1)]. in this case, ||pw v||2 = 2, and (107) becomes:

s = (c  ) 

i

q||pw4||2

(108)

(we denote w4 = w  v).

6.3 when supergravity instanton and black string preserve su-

persymmetry?

so far we have discussed instantons in at six-dimensional space. now let us introduce
the black string with some charge vector z.
in the presence of this black string, the
group so(5, 5, r) of symmetries of the classical supergravity is broken to the subgroup
so(4, 5, r) preserving the vector z. in particular, the subgroup of shifts tv, dened in
(106) preserves z if and only if (z  ) = 0 (we are considering only d black strings,
that is (z  v) = 0). therefore, if (z  ) = 0, it makes sense to consider the instantons
charged under this symmetry. the condition (z  ) = 0 by itself does not guarantee
that the instanton in the presence of the black string is a supersymmetric conguration.
for example, let us consider the d1-instanton in the background of d3-brane wrapped on
the two-cycle of the torus. if there is a nonzero ux of the b eld through this two-cycle,
then this conguration breaks all the supersymmetry. the condition for this conguration
to be supersymmetric is that the ux of b through the two-cycle on which we wrap our
d3 brane is zero. this means that

(pw4  z) = 0

(109)

in general case, the condition (109) is the necessary condition for the instanton and the
black string to be a supersymmetric conguration. one can see it in the following way.
let us consider the instanton in the presence of the large number n of coinciding black
strings, each having charge z. at each point of the transverse space, the instanton feels
approximately at background. therefore, its action is given approximately by (108)
but with w depending on the distance from the black string, according to the attractor

37

equation. the conditions for the action (108) to be constant when w changes according to
the attractor equation with given z are precisely that (pw4z  ) = 0 and (z  ) = 0. we
will prove in appendix b that the conguration consisting of black string and instanton
preserves supersymmetry if the following conditions are satised:

1)
2)
3)

(z  ) = 0
(z  pw4) = 0
||||2  0

6.4 supergravity instantons and period map.
when the condition (109) is satised, we can rewrite ||pw4||2 as follows:

||pw4||2 = ||pw4z ||2

(110)

(111)

it makes sense to discuss d-instantons when their action is very large, that is gstr << 1.

however, nothing prevents us from taking simultaneously gstrq||z||2 >> 1. therefore,

there is a regime where we can trust both the formula for the action of the d-instanton
and the near-horizon ads supergravity.

how can d-instantons help us to prove that the geometry of the target space does not
receive string loop corrections? we know that the target space is a hyperkahler manifold
with the second cohomology group isomorphic to 4,4  z. the period map can be
described as a choice of the positive-denite three-plane w model
 z  (r  4,4). it
was conjectured in [12] that
(112)

w model

3

3

= z  w4

we want to check this formula by comparing the actions of the sigma-model instantons
to the actions of the supergravity instantons. we have argued that for some special
backgrounds the sigma-model instantons are related to the d-instantons in supergravity.
the actions of these supergravity instantons are given by (108). we expect the action
of the supergravity instanton with the charge   z to be equal to the action of the
corresponding sigma-model instanton when (  pw4z) = 0. in other words, when  is
orthogonal to the projection of z+ = pw4z on z. let l  r4,4 be the six-dimensional
space of all vectors in z which are orthogonal to pw4z:

l = (r  4,4)  z  (pw4z)

(113)

then, our condition on the instanton charge is just:   l. for generic background there
are no such integer vectors  which satisfy this condition. however, there is a dense set
of such backgrounds that we can nd   l. moreover, for any vector v  l we can nd
an integer vector v  4,4 and a number   r such that v  v. this means (assuming
the smooth dependence of w model
on the background elds) that the action formula

3

38

for the supergravity instantons gives us the angle between the plane w model
arbitrary vector in l. namely, given v  l, the action formula (108) implies that:

3

and an

||pw model

3

v||2 = ||pw4 v||2

(114)

v||2 = ||v||2. this implies (112). therefore, the
for v  z  w4 we have ||pw model
action formula for supergravity instantons is in agreement with the conjectured period
map. in particular, we see that the periods do not depend on the string coupling constant.
we should notice, however, that the validity of this argument depends on the assump-

a moduli of k3 or t4 as points of grassmanian.

here we will review the correspondence between the moduli and the points of the grass-
manian manifold, following [25] and corrections in [12]. we will concentrate on the case
of k3, the case of t4 is similar.

let us rst turn o the rr elds and consider weak coupling limit. there is a one
to one correspondence between the points of the moduli space and the positive 4-planes
in r4,20. the moduli include the metric and the b eld. first, let us describe the shape
of k3. let   r4,20 be a positive 4-plane. choose w  4,20  a primitive light-like
vector. notice that
(115)
we can consider the three-plane  =   w and  = p( ) where p : w  w/w
is the projection. the 3-plane  corresponds, via the period map, to the hyperkahler
structure of our k3. now we want to specify the volume and the b eld. to do this, let
us choose another primitive light-like vector, w, so that (w  w) = 1. we represent  as
an orthogonal direct sum:
(116)

(w  4,20)/w  3,19

 =   r b,

b  

with

and

b = w + w + b

(117)

(118)
we identify b as the b eld, and  as v  1
2(b  b). we have an equivalence b  b + ,
with   h 2(k3, z). such a shift of b can be accounted for as an ambiguity in the choice

(b  w) = (b  w) = 0

39

of w. indeed, let us identify the cohomology classes of k3 with the vectors in the lattice
3,19 which is the sublattice in 4,20, orthogonal to both w and w. given such a vector
, let us consider the following automorphism of the lattice:

w 7 (w) = w    1

 7  =  + (  )w,

2 w(  ),

w  w

(119)

where  is any vector in 3,19. then the new w and w are orthogonal to the new 3,19.
if we also change b and  as follows:

b 7 (b + w(b  )) + ( + w(  ))

 7  + 1

2 [||b||2  ||b + ||2]

(120)

then the new b coincides with the old b, therefore all that we have done was to pick
dierent w. the transformation laws (120) suggest that b should be identied with the
b eld, and  should be identied as follows:

 = v 

1
2

(b  b)

(121)

this is one of the results in [12]. following [12], we use the notation (x, v, y) for the vector
xw + yw + v, where x, y  r and v  r3,19.
now let us include the ramond-ramond elds and the coupling constant. we enlarge
our lattice from 4,20 to 5,21 by adding 1,1. we will denote the vectors from r5,21 in the
following way: [(x, v, y), (x, y)] where (x, v, y) is the vector from r4,20 and (x, y) is the
vector from r1,1. the scalar product is:

|| [(x, v, y), (x, y)] ||2 = 2xy + ||v||2 + 2xy

now we are ready to describe the correspondence between the moduli and the points of
grassmanian. the plane w is generated by the following ve vectors. four vectors are
of the form

with vi = (0, i,(b  i)) and v0 = (1, b, v  1
1

e = [v, (0,(c  v))]
2 !#
e5 ="c, 1 ,
2  ||c||2

2(b  b)), and the fth vector is

let us explain what is  and c. we dene c  r4,20 as follows:

c = (c0, c2, c4)

where c0, c2, c4 are related to the ramond-ramond uxes a in the following way:

c = c0 + c2 + c4 = (a0 + a2 + a4)eb

40

(122)

(123)

(124)

(125)

here we consider a0, c0 zero-forms, a2, c2 and b two-forms and a4, c4 four-forms.
the coupling of the elds on the brane world-volume to the ramond-ramond uxes is:

z a  tr exp(cid:18) 1

2i

f  b(cid:19)

(126)

the formula (125) can be veried by considering the transformations of c under the
element of the t-duality group which shifts the b-eld. for the large volume torus (or
k3) we have the following relation between the numbers of branes (q4, q2, q0) and the
parameters of the 1 + 5-dimensional yang-mills:

(q4, q2,q0) = tr exp(cid:18) 1

2i

f(cid:19)

(127)

(for the large volume torus, the yang-mills theory lives on d5 branes, and the rank of
the gauge group is q4. the sign of q0 may be understood in the following way. let us
consider the d1d5 system wrapped on k3. on one hand, to get bps conguration we
should have q0q4 > 0. on the other hand, d-strings should become anti-self-dual gauge

elds on k3, so that r tr(cid:16) 1

2i f(cid:17)2

< 0).

the six-dimensional string coupling constant is related to the ten-dimensional gstr:

this  is invariant under t duality.

b instanton in the presence of string: an example.

here we want to prove that the conguration consisting of the black string with the
charge z and the d-instanton with the charge vector  preserves 1
8 of supersymmetry, if
(  z) = 0, (  pw4z) = 0 and ||||2  0. we will consider the conguration consisting
of the black string with q2 = 0 (only d1 and d5, no d3), and the instanton obtained
by wrapping the d1-string on the holomorphic cycle  in t4. it is enough to consider
this conguration, because any other pair of orthogonal vectors  and z can be brought
to this one by so(4, 4, r) transformations (we do not need this transformations to be
dened over z, because we want just to understand whether supersymmetry is preserved,
and this is the property of the classical supergravity solution).

let us temporarily turn o the b eld. the euclidean dp-brane stretched along
the coordinates y1, . . . , yp+1 preserves the combination of supercharges, satisfying the
condition:

(129)
for example, for the d1 instanton, l = ir [42]. let us denote x0 and x5 coordinates
parallel to the black string, and x1, . . . , x4 coordinates in the torus. the supersymmetries

1    p+1l = ir

41

preserved by the d1/d5 system are:

05l = ir

051    4l = ir

(130)

suppose that the cycle  on which we wrap our d-string to get an instanton is holomorphic
in some complex structure of the torus. the corresponding kahler form r can act
on spinors (being contracted with gamma-matrices). we will denote the corresponding
operator r. the supersymmetry preserved by the instanton is selected by the condition
that l is chiral in the tangent space to t4 and r is:

rl = ir

(131)

this equation, together with (130) implies that l is chiral in the tangent space of t4 and
also subject to the condition rl = 05l. then, r is expressed in terms of l by one
of the equations (130). we see that our background preserves 1

8 of the supersymmetry.

our background was quite generic except that we have put b = 0. to turn on the b
eld, we use the subgroup so(3, 3, r)  so(4, 4, r) which preserves both z = (q4, 0, q0)
and  = (0, , 0). this groups contains rotations in the plane generated by (q4, 0,q0)
and (0, , 0), where   h 2(t4, r) is orthogonal to . one can see that innitesimal
rotations in such a plane transform our background with zero b eld to the background
with the innitesimal b eld b satisfying the condition (b  ) = 0 and otherwise
arbitrary. this means, that there is one and only one condition for the background with
nonzero b to be connected to the background with zero b by the rotation orthogonal to
both z and . this condition is (z  pw4) = 0.
