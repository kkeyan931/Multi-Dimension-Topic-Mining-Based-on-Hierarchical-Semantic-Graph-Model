origin somewhat surprising nd branes ability describe sophisticated properties four-dimensional quantum eld theories studied many years. quantum eld theories quantum eld theories live intersection

m-vebrane equations motion. however, one would expect higher derivative corrections agree indeed known n = 2 gauge theories higher derivative terms yang-mills theory m-vebrane dynamics dier . one may expect low energy eects dual theory low energy eective action m-vebrane agree circumstances one would expect substantial degree agreement energies scales brane conguration. particular two theories share spectrum states gauge symmetry. however microscopic description m-theory available would expect brane eective eld theory dual yang-mills eective eld theory would agree scales plank scale. m-vebrane particularly interesting study since two-form gauge eld worldvolume theory satises non-linear self-duality con- straint. known microscopic description available d- branes, however low energy

limit d-fourbranes, includ- ing quantum eects. thus two-form gauge eld contains information strongly coupled non-abelian d-fourbrane dynamics, even though low energy eective actions one obtain present m-vebrane contain abelian gauge elds. however abelian theories incorporate non-abelian aspects dual theory, characteristic symmetry breaking scale. example, non-linearities eective action reect

m-vebrane congurations corresponding conned gauge theories, long range gauge group. although lack microscopic de- scription makes quantitative predictions dicult obtain. fact, degrees 3 freedom occur dual theory masses order scales set brane conguration also description terms dynamics m-vebrane. example solitonic solutions occur underlying non-abelian theory, particular monopoles. yang-mills theories rely non-abelian structure existence occur solutions low energy eective action. however properties inferred brane dynamics introducing m-twobranes intersect m-vebrane worldvol- ume . way brane congurations mimic behaviour dual yang-mills theories. string theory play role complete description physics must contain physics standard model low energy. seems natural branes play part way standard model arises (for recent work reviews see  references therein). scenarios usually assumed standard model low energy eective action string theory, perhaps background brane conguration. moreover usually assumed minimal supersymmetric extension standard model, grand unied extension it, low energy action string theory, become valid scale near mw . paper take signicantly dierent approach deriving low energy eective dynamics electro-weak interactions. exploit fact single m-vebrane naturally leads low energy eective action broken supersymmetry, spontaneously broken gauge

new, braney physics beyond mw scale. also hope work describe useful studying phenomenological models derived branes. although paper nd brane derived low energy eec- tive action systematically identify problems one encounters illustrate may solved within context toy model. problems thought essentially two ways. firstly must nd brane conguration correct modes (e.g. dual theory standard model). secondly must analyse conguration m-theory obtain brane low energy eective action (e.g. need determine geometry m-vebrane resulting zero modes). one obvious problems nd brane conguration gauge group
