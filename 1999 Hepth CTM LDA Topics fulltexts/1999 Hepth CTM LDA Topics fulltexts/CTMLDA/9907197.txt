(5) choice (5) mass term gives us two dierent absolute minima energy eld conguration constant u = 1 (vacua states theory). note usual mass term leads existence one vacuum state theory (at u = 1): lmass = 1 8 m2 f 2 r(u + u + 2). (6) note also eld conguration diers slightly vacuum u = 1, i.e. |u 1| 1, two mass terms (5) (6) similar. modied (5) standard (6) versions lagrangian possess solutions skyrmion type. however, modied version model possesses also solutions form domain walls. explicit expression solution easily obtained change variables (~, 0) eld variables. namely, replace (~, 0) (f, g, h) dened (~, 0) = (sin f sin g sin h, sin f sin g cos h, sin f cos g, cos f ), (7) f = f (~r, t), g = g(~r, t) h = h(~r, t), f , g , h  . note constraint (4) automatically satised. lagrangian (1) , written terms f, g h given by: l = f 2 8 {f 2 + sin2 f g2 + sin2 f sin2 g h2 + k sin2 f  2 m2 v (f, g)}, (8) k = 2/f 2 e2. 4 consider case elds g h constant. case get (5) following equation motion eld f : f + m2 2 sin 2f = 0. among solutions equation (9) static soliton solution fsol(x) = 2 arctan exp (m(x x0)). (9) (10) (3+1) dimensional space-time solution looks like domain wall links two vacuum states u = 1 theory. terms angular variable f skyrmion solution becomes: u(~r) = cos fsk(r) + i~~n sin fsk(r), (11) fsk skyrmion prole function  satisfying boundary conditions fsk(0) = , fsk() = 0 ~n = ~r/r. skyrmion solutions characterized integer valued degree mapping s3 (compactied r3 physical space) s3 - isospace. analytical formula degree mapping (ie winding number), written terms elds f , g h, q = 6z sin2 f sin g ijk fi gj hkdx3, (12) used latin indices denote spatial variables. iii. topological soliton domain wall shown previous paper , (2+1) - dimensional skyrme-like eld theory possesses solutions correspond topological waves. behave like massless wave packets carry topological charge. would interesting see whether analogous solutions exist (3+1)-eld theory. answer question let us seek solutions equation motion lagrangian (5) form generalized cylindrically symmetric hegehog ansatz: f = f (t, x, ), g = g(t, x, ), h = n, (13) 5 n integer changed euclidean coordinates (x, y, z) cylindrical ones (x, r, ), (x, y, z) (x, cos , sin ). (14) interesting note h = n compatible equations motion (ie h equation automatically satised). look remaining equations. terms functions f g lagrangian becomes: l = f 2 8 r {f 2 f 2 x f 2 + sin2 f (g2 g2 x g2 ) sin2 f sin2 g n2 2 + k sin2 f  2 m2 v (f, g)}2 dx, (16) (16) used expression general (5) mass term. new mass term depends variables f g. purpose generalization become obvious soon. equations motion functions f g, follow lagrangian (16), are: ftt fxx f f sin f cos f (g2 g2 x g2 sin2 g n2 2 ) + m2 v (f ) f + k sin f cos f  + k sin2 f  = 0. gtt gxx g g + 2 cotf (ftgt fxgx fg) + sin g cos g n2 2 + m2 sin2 f v (f,g) g + k  = 0 f 2 x f 2 2 (f 2 2 (g2 g2 x g2 ) 6 worth emphasising here, setting h = n lead serious simplication problem. fact, choice h corresponds using one integral motion n, whose conservation reects internal symmetry solutions theory (1)/. note introducing hegehog ansatz able reduce problem solve two coupled equations functions f g (2+1) dimensions instead consider coupled partial dierential equations three functions f , g h (3+1) dimensions. note also ansatz topological charge becomes: q = 12nz sin2 f sin g(fgx fxg) dx d. (18) note expression nonzero n 6= 0. thus check whether hegehog ansatz gives us skyrmion solution see nd solutions equations (18) boundary conditions: f (, ) = 0, f (+, ) = ; g(x, 0) = , g(x, +) = 0. (19) boundary conditions guarantee nontrivial topological charge system. note nontrivial solutions (18) within class functions separated variables, i.e. form f = f (x), g = g(). (20) easily veried looking lagrangian (16), term (fxg fgx)2 clearly indicates possible nd nontrivial solutions form (20). let us look next stationary solutions eqs. (18). consider expression mass term v (f, g) form v (f, g) = 1 2 sin2 f (1 cos2 g), (21) 0 < < 1. using form v (f, g), performing numerical simulation, managed nd solution equations (18) boundary conditions (19). 7 solution looks like slightly deformed 2-dimensional (in , variables) skyrmion (or hegehog) located domain wall near origin x = 0. picture elds f g well energy density solution shown figure 1 using r, x coordinates. one sees clearly corresponds bound states skyrmion domain wall. topological charge conguration 1. solution stable respect 3-dimensional (~r ~r) scaling transformations well respect 2-dimensional ones, (x, , ) (x, , ). notice stability condition respect 2-dimensional transformations similar condition skyrmions baby-skyrmion model (2+1) dimensions, mass term needed guarantee stability (see, e.g.  references therein). case 0 , i.e. case v (f, g) = 1 2 sin2 f (22) initially formed eld conguration carries topological charge located domain wall unstable respect scale transformations (, )-plane. initially formed eld conguration case = 0 looks like wave packet, spreads along domain wall. shows case lagrangian (1) mass term given (5) nontrivial topological congurations domain wall manifest topological radial waves. thus skyrmion, located outside domain wall, captured, absorbed domain wall. necessary condition capture process attraction skyrmion domain wall. iv. attraction skyrmions domain walls section show skyrmions absorbed domain wall form eld congurations described previous section. demonstrate per- formed numerical simulations time evolution various eld congurations describing skyrmions domain walls. work used lagrangian (1) written terms three angular elds f , g h. forced consider this, general conguration (13), isolated domain wall eld h constant incompatible hegehog ansatz describes skyrmion. thus, study interaction need 8 consider general elds. see problem determining interaction skyrmions domain walls complicated problem looking bound states skyrmions domain walls. first performed numerical evolution skyrmion placed nite distance domain wall rst modied model ( = 0). done various relative orientations skyrmion respect domain wall. eah case evolution similar every orientation tried: skyrmion attracted wall nally merge it. structure formed process dissipated radiating concentric waves wall. figure 2 shows evolution cross section x plane (the plane perpandicular wall) energy density process. one sees that, beeing absorbed, skyrmion transformed wave happens topologically non trivial. next performed simulation = 0.3. skyrmion absorbed wall except time instead radiated along wall, formed bound state wall. figure 3 show evolution cross section x plane energy density process. conguration caries one unit topological charge similar topological structure described previous section. looked interaction 2-skyrmion conguration wall using = 0.3 again. single skyrmion, two skyrmions attracted wall merged form static ring-like structure wall. figure 4, show cross section energy density x plane z plane (on wall) structure settled down. v. summary final comments established existence bound states skyrmions domain walls. de- pending form mass term theory solution either stable unstable. case o(4)-symmetry broken o(3) z2 solution unstable evolution looks like evolution wave packet domain wall carries topo- logical charge. also shown skyrmions absorbed domain wall eld conguration transmuted topological waves wall. considering 9 topological charge baryonic charge, picture corresponds absorption baryons domain walls. note that, dierent vacua left right domain wall, skyrmions antiskyrmions (or baryons antibaryons) behave dierently. end speculation arguments, ie separation skyrmions antiskyrmions domain wall observation absorbtion skyrmions walls may relevant discussion observed baryon-antibaryon asymmetry universe. acknowledgments. work partly supported rffi grants 96-15-96578, rfbr-98-02-17316 royal society grant. 10
