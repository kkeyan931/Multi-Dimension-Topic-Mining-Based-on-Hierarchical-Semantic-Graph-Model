abstract

a dynamical mass generation of a two-component fermion in qed3 with the
chern-simons term is investigated by solving the schwinger-dyson equation formu-
lated in the lowest ladder approximation. dependence of the dynamical fermion
mass on the gauge-xing parameter, the gauge coupling constant, and the topologi-
cal mass is examined by approximated analytical and also numerical methods. the
inclusion of the chern-simons term makes impossible to choose a peculiar gauge in
which the wave function renormalization is absent. the numerical evaluation shows
that the wave function renormalization is fairly close to 1 in the landau gauge. it
means that this gauge is still a specic gauge where the ward-takahashi identity is
satised approximately. we also nd that the dynamical mass is almost independent
of the topological mass in a parameter region adopted here, while the dynamical
mass decreases very slightly when the topological mass is comparable to or smaller
than the coupling constant. it seems that the amount of parity breaking due to the
chern-simons term in the gauge sector aects the dynamical mass generation in
the fermion sector in a non-trivial way.

i. introduction

in (2+1)-dimensions, generally in odd-dimensional space-time, a peculiar type of quantum

eld theory exists. that is the theory with the chern-simons term in the action. [1, 2] the

chern-simons term may be added to the action by hand or induced in an eective action

by a vacuum polarization eect of a fermion as the anomaly [3]. our understanding on

the theory has been progressed especially through the studies of the topological structure

due to the chern-simons term. [4]

on the other hand, two important phenomena were discovered in condensed matter

systems. one is the quantum hall eect [5] and the other is the high-tc superconductiv-

ity [6]. both phenomena may be thought of as realizations of the macroscopic quantum

eects in planar systems in which electrons have a strong correlation. it is challenging to

ask whether and how the chern-simons term is related to these phenomena discovered in

the two-dimensional electron systems. these situations have activated the study of the

(2+1)-dimensional quantum eld theories.

in (2+1)-dimensional gauge theories, the behaviours in infrared regions seem to be

unstable at least in the perturbative treatment. the chern-simons term gives the gauge

eld a topological mass without breaking the gauge symmetry so that the term may rescue

the theory from the infrared catastrophe. this is an original motivation of including the

chern-simons term in the action. [7] reminding those studies, we think that one of most

important problems which are still unclear is what is a role of the chern-simons term in

a nonpertubative region. it is our purpose to clarify how the chern-simons term aects

to nonpertubative dynamics.

the dynamical mass generation of a fermion is an important phenomenon induced

by the nonperturbative eects.

in even-dimensional space-time, the chiral symmetry

forbids the mass of the fermion. the nonperturbative eect can break this symmetry

giving the mass to the fermion. as is well known, we cannot dene the chiral symme-

try for a two-component fermion which belongs to the irreducible spinor representation

1

in (2+1)-dimensions. instead parity symmetry (p2) forbids the two-component fermion

having a mass. on the other hand, for a f our-component fermion which is composed of

two two-component fermions, we can dene a kind of chiral symmetry. the chiral

transformation is dened by a combination of the parity and z2 avour transformations.
(p4 = p  z2)

many studies on the dynamical mass generation in qed3 have been done already

by using the schwinger-dyson technique [8] or the lattice monte-carlo method [9]. in

almost of previous works, these authors have studied the dynamical mass generation of

the four-component fermions in the theory without the chern-simons term, which is a

spontaneous symmetry breaking of p4 but not p2. these studies have been extended

to the case with the chern-simons term but the fermion considered there has been the

four-component one. [10]

the theory with n four-component fermions is equivalent to the theory with 2n

two-component fermions.

in this sense, the theory with the four-component fermions

can describe only the case with even number of avours (counting the two-component

fermions). it is interesting to ask what happens in the theory with odd number of avours.

this also is one of our motivations of the present work. the most simplest version of the

theory with odd number of avours is the case with a single avour. the rst work

concerned with the dynamical mass generation of the single two-component fermion in

qed3 without the chern-simons term was done in ref.

[11]. the symmetry which was

studied in the work is p2 but not p4. in this paper, we extend the work to the case with

the chern-simons term.

thus we consider the dynamical mass generation of the single two-component fermion

in qed3 with the chern-simons term. the schwinger-dyson equations are formulated

in the lowest ladder approximation, which are two coupled integral equations. due to the

chern-simons term, a drastic change happens in the structure of the schwinger-dyson

equations. while the wave function renormalization is absent in the landau gauge in

qed3 without the chern-simons term, the inclusion of the chern-simons term makes

2

impossible to choose a peculiar gauge in which the wave function is not renormalized.

because there are no ad hoc reasons that the landau gauge is specic in qed3 with the

chern-simons term, we should study the coupled integral equations for various values of

the gauge parameter.

our strategies in this work are as follows: first we solve the coupled integral equations

in an approximated analytical method which is very crude but may be available for refer-

ence to a more complete numerical calculation. after that, the coupled integral equations

are solved numerically. in these analyses, we study dependence of the dynamical mass on

the gauge-xing parameter, the coupling constant, and the topological mass.

this paper is organized as follows: in sec. ii, we explain the model which we use.

the schwinger-dyson equations in the lowest ladder approximation are derived in sec.

iii. in sec. iv, the equations are analyzed by the approximated analytical method. the

numerical analysis of the equations are presented in sec. v. finally we conclude our

results with discussions in sec. vi.

ii. maxwell-chern-simons qed3

the model which we consider is an extended version of the usual three-dimensional quan-

tum electrodynamics (qed3). it has both of the maxwell and chern-simons terms as the

action of the u(1) gauge eld . we call this theory the maxwell-chern-simons qed3. [7]

the gauge eld is coupled to a two-component dirac fermion. the lagrangian density of

the theory is given by

l =

(1)

the second term in the right-hand side of eq.(1) is the so-called chern-simons term. it is

well-known that the term gives the gauge eld a mass  without breaking the gauge sym-

metry.  is called the topological mass because the chern-simons term has a topological

meaning as the secondary characteristic class [4, 12].  is the gauge-xing parameter and

e is the gauge coupling constant.  is the two-component fermion eld which belongs to

3

the irreducible spinor representation in (2+1)-dimensions. the dirac matrices are dened
by  0 = 3,  1 = i1,  2 = i2 with diag(g) = (1,1,1) where is (i=1, 2, 3) are
the pauli matrices. the s satisfy relations as {, } = 2g,  = i + g
and tr[] = 2g. in this representation, there does not exist a matrix which anti-

commutes with all of s so that we cannot dene the chiral transformation. this is a

specic aspect of the odd-dimensional space-time. in even-dimensions, the chiral sym-

metry requires that a fermion is massless. in odd-dimensions, the chiral symmetry itself

does not exist. instead, the mass term of the fermion is forbidden by parity symmetry.

the parity transformation is dened as

x = (t, x, y)  x = (t,x, y) ,

(x)   1(x) ,
a0(x)  a0(x) ,
a1(x)  a1(x) ,
a2(x)  a2(x) .

(2)

under the parity transformation, the mass term of fermion and the chern-simons term

change their signs. thus the mass terms of both the fermion and the gauge eld are

forbidden by the parity symmetry. we study how the breaking of parity by the topological

mass aects the mass generation of the fermion.

iii. schwinger-dyson equations

as a non-perturbative method to evaluate the dynamical mass of the fermion, we use

here the schwinger-dyson technique. the schwinger-dyson equation for the fermion

self-energy (p) is written as

(p) = (ie)2z

d3k
(2)3  is 

f (k) (k, p  k) id

(p  k) .

is 

f (p) =

i

,

(4)

i

=

a(p) 6p  b(p)

6p  i(p)

where a(p) and b(p) are functions of pp in taking into account the relativistic nature,
while (p) depends on ps. a(p)1 is the wave function renormalization and b(p)/a(p)

is a mass induced by dynamical eects at the momentum scale p. the so-called dynamical

mass mphys is dened by mphys = b(0)/a(0) as usual. it is useful to notice the relations

as

tr[(p)] = 2ib(p) ,

tr[6p(p)] = 2i(a(p)  1)p2 .

(5)

to proceed our analysis of eq.(3) further, we need to introduce any suitable approxi-

mation. in this paper, we limit ourselves to use the lowest ladder approximation where the

full propagator of the gauge eld and the full vertex are replaced by the free propagator

and the tree vertex respectively as

id

(p  k)  id(p  k) , (k, p  k)  

.

(6)

the analysis beyond the ladder approximation will appear elsewhere. the free propagator

of the gauge eld is derived from the lagrangian density (1) as

id(p) = i

thus the schwinger-dyson equation in the lowest ladder approximation becomes

f (k) id(p  k) .

(7)

(8)

we substitute eqs.(4) and (7) into eq.(8) and use eq.(5) in producing two coupled

equations. after taking the traces, we obtain the coupled integral equations as

now we change the metric to the euclidean one by the wick rotation as (k0, ~k)

p2 = (p0)2  (p1)2. after that, we transform the integral variables ks to the polar
coordinates (k, , ). the angular integration on  and  can be done explicitly. (the

useful integral formulae are listed in appendix a.) finally we obtain the coupled integral

in the successive secs. iv and v, we solve these equations by an approximated analytical

we can check easily that eqs. (11) and (12) reduce to the schwinger-dyson equations in

which are the schwinger-dyson equations in the lowest ladder approximation derived in

qed3 without the chern-simons term.2 we can see that there exists the specic gauge

( = 0) where the wave function renormalization is absent. thus in the landau gauge

eq. (14) gives us the simple solution as a(p) = 1 and the problem reduces to solve eq.

(13) with a(p) = 1.

in the case with the chern-simons term, as is seen in eqs. (11) and (12), there does

not exist such a specic gauge where the wave function is not renormalized. as far as

we cannot nd a self-evident reason that the landau is still specic in qed3 with the

chern-simons term, it must be fair to study eqs. (11) and (12) for various values of the

gauge-xing parameter .

iv-b. small p expansion and perturbative results

at rst sight, eqs. (11) and (12) seem to be dangerous in the limit p  0. but we can
check that this limit is well-dened. in the region p  0, eqs.(11) and (12) are written as

(16)

(see appendix b.) from eqs. (15) and (16), we can derive the result which is obtained

in the lowest-order of perturbation. by setting a(k) = 1 and b(k) = 0 and performing

2in [11], there were some typing mistakes. we give the correct equations in eqs. (13) and (14).

where  is the infrared cuto in the integration on k.

it should be noticed that b(0)

depends on only the sign of . this also may be a specic aspect in the (2+1)-dimensions.

the dependence of a(0) on  shows that only the landau gauge is free from the infrared

divergence. on the other hand, a(0) is singular at  = 0 so that the theory with the

chern-simons term may not be smoothly connected to the theory without the chern-

simons term at least in the lowest-order perturbation.

iv-c. constant approximation

before proceeding to a numerical analysis, it is very useful if we can estimate a(0) and

b(0) analytically even under a fairly crude approximation. the kernels of these integral

equations are dumped rapidly as the integral variable k increases so that the contribution
from k  0 is the most dominant one in the integrals. we approximate a(k) and b(k) by
a(0) and b(0) in the integrals. we call this approximation the constant approximation.

of course this approximation might be too crude for our propose and we only use the

result as reference for the numerical analysis. under this approximation, we can perform

the remaining radial integrations and have the simple algebraic equations as

from eqs.(20) and (21), we can see that the dependence of b(0) and a(0) on the

gauge-xing parameter, the coupling constant and the topological mass has the following

peculiar features:

1) dependence on the gauge-xing parameter

b(0) depends linearly on . it is suggestive that a(0) is singular at  = 6 where
b(0) vanishes. in the landau gauge ( = 0), a(0) = 1 and b(0) = e2/2. a(0) = 1

is favourable for us because a(p) = 1 means that the ward-takahashi identity is

satised.

2) dependence on the coupling constant

a(0) does not depend on e2. it means that the deviation of a(0) from 1 is inde-

pendent of the coupling constant. this is crucially dierent from the perturbative

result given by eq.(17) where the deviation is proportional to e2. on the other

hand, b(0) is proportional to e2.

3) dependence on the topological mass

we recognize that eqs.(20) and (21) are independent of the topological mass . it

means that the amount of the explicit parity breaking in the gauge sector by the

topological mass does not aect the dynamical mass in the fermion sector. this

fact is not so easy to be understood for us.

now we proceed to a more precise numerical evaluation in the next section.

v. numerical analysis

v-a. non-trivial solutions

we solve the two coupled integral equations (11) and (12) numerically by using a method

of iteration. first we substitute trial functions into a(k) and b(k) in the right-hand

sides of eqs. (11) and (12) and then calculate the integrals numerically. the outputs so

obtained, a(p) and b(p), are substituted back to the right-hand sides until the outputs

9

coincide with the inputs. finally we obtain a convergent function which satises the

integral equations, if there exist any solutions in eqs. (11) and (12).

we obtain the non-trivial solutions for the various values of the gauge parameters .

for e = 1.0 and  = 1.0, a(p)s in the cases of  = 0, 1, 2, 3 are shown in fig. 1. the

corresponding b(p)s are presented in fig. 2. we nd a very interesting feature that a(p)

is fairly close to 1 in the landau gauge ( = 0).

in the case of qed3 without the chern-simons term, a(p) is exactly equal to 1 in

the landau gauge under the lowest ladder approximation. however, in the case of qed3

with the chern-simons, there may be no apparent reason that a(p) = 1 in the landau

gauge. our numerical calculation shows that the landau gauge is still a good gauge giving
a(p)  1. in a sense, it is surprising that the numerical calculation of so complicated
integral equations results that a(p)  1 in the landau gauge. there might be a simple
reason of explaining a peculiarity of the landau gauge but it is an open question.

v-b. dependence on the gauge parameter

the dependence of a(0) and b(0) on the gauge-xing parameter  is shown in figs. 3

and 4. in the region  > 0, the numerical result is consistent with the one obtained in

the constant approximation.

but in the region  < 0, there appears a very strange behaviour which may be a

bifurcation of the solutions. the a(p) and b(p) in the region  < 0 are shown in fig.

5 and 6. in general, a bifurcation phenomenon is related to a degeneracy of states in a

non-linear system. it might be interesting to proceed a study in this direction.

the results obtained in secs.v-a and v-b suggest us that the landau gauge is still

the best gauge. hereafter we present mainly the results obtained in the landau gauge.

v-c. dependence on the coupling constant

in fig. 7 we show the dependence of a(0) on the coupling constant e. the series of

figs. 8, 9 and 10 show the e2-dependence of b(0) in the dierent scales of e2. we can

10

see that the deviation of a(0) from 1 is less than 1 %. we may say that a(0) is almost

equal to 1 in all region of the coupling constant. on the other hand, b(0) increases

as the coupling constant becomes larger. the e2-dependence of b(0) is almost linear

when the coupling constant is small. this is consistent with the constant approximation.

but the slope is smaller than the one obtained in the constant approximation and the

line curves downward slightly as the coupling constant becomes larger, which may be a

non-perturbative eect.

v-d. dependence on the topological mass

what we are most interested in is the dependence of the dynamical mass of the fermion

on the topological mass of the gauge eld. in the constant approximation, it has been

shown that both a(0) and b(0) do not depend on the topological mass. is this true in

the more precise numerical evaluation?

in fig. 11, it can be seen that the -dependence of a(0) is extremely weak. the

deviation from a(0) = 1 is almost absent. on the other hand, the -dependence of b(0)

is shown in fig.12. it seems that b(0) also is almost constant. when the topological

mass is comparable to or smaller than the coupling constant, b(0) decreases very slightly.

it should be noticed that for small and large values of the topological mass compared

with the coupling constant, there appears a technical diculty in the numerical calcula-

tion as follows: in principle, we do not need to cut o the region of the energy-momentum

integrals in eqs. (12) and (11). but in the practical prescription of the numerical inte-

gration, the innite range of the integration must be replaced to a nite one so that it

is not avoidable to introduce cut-o parameters. the cut-o dependence of the results

must be checked carefully. in the parameter region adopted in the previous subsections
(e2 = 1.0  104  100 and  = 1.0), it has been conrmed easily that the cut-o de-
pendence is negligible in fact. when the topological mass  takes small or large values

compared with e, it has been found that the integration region must be taken wider

enough to get reliable results. it needs much machine power.

11

in getting the results of figs. 11 and 12, we have checked the absence of the cut-o
dependence in detail in the parameter region adopted here (e = 0.01 and  = 0.001 
1000). therefore we conclude that the behaviour of b(0) for  comparable to or smaller

than e is not due to the cut-o. we also wonder that there might appear any other

non-trivial -dependence of a(0) and b(0). we are now proceeding to evaluate the -

dependence of a(0) and b(0) in the various values of the coupling constant e.

vi. conclusion and discussion

we have investigated the dynamical mass generation of the single two-component fermion

and b(p), where the full fermion propagator is dened by s 

in qed3 with the chern-simons term. the coupled schwinger-dyson equations for a(p)
f (p)1 = a(p) 6p b(p), have
been formulated in the lowest ladder approximation. when the chern-simons term is

included, there does not exist the specic gauge where a(p) is automatically equal to 1 as

the case without the chern-simons term. we examine the dependence of the dynamical

mass on the gauge-xing parameter, the coupling constant and the topological mass by

using the approximated analytical and also the numerical methods. @

the coupled integral equations have been solved rst analytically in the constant

approximation where a(p) and b(p) have been replaced by a(0) and b(0) respectively.

we have found that b(0) is proportional to the gauge-xing parameter  and also to

the square of the coupling constant e. on the other hand, a(0) is independent of e and
singular at  = 6 where b(0) vanishes. we also have found that a(0) and b(0) do not
depend on the topological mass.

keeping these facts in mind we have proceeded to solve the set of the integral equations

by using the numerical method. the dependences of a(0) and b(0) on  and e are almost

consistent with the results derived in the constant approximation. b(0) depends on 

linearly. the e2-dependence of b(0) also is almost linear but the value of the slope becomes

smaller than the one in the constant approximation as e2 increases. the e-dependence of

a(0) is almost absent.

12

further we have discovered some novel features in the numerical analysis. first we
have found a(p)  1 at  = 0 so that the landau gauge is still a good gauge where
it is not entirely obvious why
the ward-takahashi identity is satised approximately.

the numerical evaluation of so complicated integral equations results that a(0) is almost

equal to 1 at  = 0. we may expect that there is any simple reason.

secondly we have found a strange behaviour of a(0) in the region  < 0. there has

appeared the bifurcation of the solutions. the bifurcation is a popular phenomena in a

non-linear system. we wonder that the bifurcation appeared here would have any physical

meaning or not.

as the third, it seems that the dynamical mass of the fermion is almost independent of

the topological mass, but the dynamical mass decreases very slightly when the topological

mass is comparable to or smaller than the coupling constant. why it is? of course, we

should be careful before accepting this result. the best way to conrm the result is to

give a proof by analytical method but it is very dicult because the integral equations

are highly non-linear. we are now extending the parameter region to search any more

non-trivial structure of the -dependence of the dynamical mass of the fermion in the

various values of the coupling constant. the result will be reported separately.
