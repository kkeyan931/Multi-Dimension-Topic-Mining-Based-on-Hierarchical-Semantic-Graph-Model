aspects of heterotic/m-theory
duality in d=3

abstract we study the duality between m-theory compactied on calabi-yau
fourfolds and the heterotic string compactied on calabi-yau threefolds
times a circle. our analysis is based on a comparison of the low energy
eective actions in three dimensions.

non-perturbative n=1 vacua of the heterotic string in d=4 are of
particular interest due to their phenomenological prospects [1]. a cer-
tain class of such vacua is best described by f-theory compactied on
elliptic calabi-yau fourfolds y4 [2, 3]. a closely related but technically
simpler class of vacua is obtained by further compactifying the heterotic
string on a circle s1 down to d=3; some of their non-perturbative prop-
erties are captured by m-theory compactied on y4 [4]. in this short
note we display the corresponding eective lagrangians and their rela-
tion following a similar analysis carried out for the duality of type iia
on y3 and the heterotic string on k3t 2 in ref. [5]. a more detailed
presentation of our results will be given in a forthcoming paper [6].
our starting point is a generic eective lagrangian of n=1, d=4

heterotic string vacua1 (using the conventions of ref. [7])

in d=3 the vector multiplet contains an adjoint
scalar  a so that the gauge group g is generically broken to its abelian
subgroup [u (1)]r(g).
(by slight abuse of notation we choose to label
in the following the dierent u (1) gauge multiplets by the index a i.e.
in d=3 an abelian vector is dual to a scalar and
a = 1, . . . , r(g)).
 and by  the dual scalar of
we denote by c a the scalars dual to aa
b. in the dual picture all supermultiplets are chiral and their scalar
elds parametrize a kahler manifold [9]. the kahler structure becomes
manifest in the coordinates

inserting (2) into (1) using (3), performing the duality transformation
and a weyl rescaling results in the 3-dimensional kahler potential

this can be further simplied by using the known tree level form of k (4)
and fa. one has fa = s and k (4) = k (4)ln(s + s) where k (4) depends
on all moduli but the 4-dimensional dilaton s [7]. for this case (4) reads

k (3)

het = k (4)  lnh(t + t )(s + s)  (da + da)2i .

on the m-theory side we start with the 11-dimensional supergravity

2we ignore all charged matter multiplets and solely focus on the chiral moduli multiplets
and the vector multiplets. we also neglect the possibility of anomalous u (1) gauge factors
with appropriate 4-dimensional green-schwarz terms.

where a3 is a 3-form and f4 its eld strength. a kaluza-klein reduction
on y4 in the spirit of [11] leads to massless bosons in d=3 corresponding
to the hodge-numbers h1,1, h1,2 and h1,3 of y4.3 the corresponding har-
monic forms are denoted by v a  h 1,1, i  h 2,1 and   h 3,1. the

3we choose to focus on such y4 that lead to duals of the perturbative heterotic string without

equating the full kahler potentials k (3)

het results in a condi-
tion for the intersection numbers dabcd. in the following we show the
equivalence of the two kahler potentials in a particular limit and post-
pone the general analysis to ref. [6]. fibering the 7-dimensional duality
(m/k3  het/t3) [15] suggests to choose a k3 bred fourfold (where we
assume that there are no bad bres introducing additional (1,1)-forms)
and an elliptically bred threefold [3]. as the base b2 we take in both
theories a hirzebruch surface (whose two kahler moduli we denote by u
and v ). furthermore we freeze the values of the scalars ni , z  to zero
and consider on both sides the large base limit. in this limit one can
choose the divisors of y4 in such a way, that the leading terms of k (3)
m
correspond to the intersection numbers du v a b =  a b = (+,, . . . ,),
where a, b denote the kahler moduli of the generic k3 bre and  a b is
the intersection form of the corresponding divisors in k3. using these
intersection numbers in (14) results in

k (3)

m =  lnh( u +  u )( v +  v )(

a + 

a) a b(

b + 

b)i .

(15)

on the heterotic side we take only s, t, da and the (1,1) moduli u, v
of the base b2 into account and freeze all other (1,1), all (1,2) and all
gauge bundle moduli. in the limit of a large base k (4) simplies and
one has k (4) =  ln(u + u )(v + v ). thus, the kahler potentials agree
a) and (u, v )  ( u ,  v ). this result is
if one identies (s, t, da)  (
in accord with the formulas relating the spectra of dual pairs given in
[3, 16].
