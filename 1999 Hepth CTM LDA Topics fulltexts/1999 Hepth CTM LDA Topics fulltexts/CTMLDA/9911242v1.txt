abstract

we derive a new version of non-abelian stokes theorem for the wilson loop in the
su(n) case by making use of the coherent state representation on the coset space
su(n)/u(1)n1 = fn1, the ag space. we consider the su(n) yang-mills theory
in the maximal abelian gauge in which su(n) is broken down to u(1)n1. first, we
show that the abelian dominance in the string tension follows from this theorem and
the abelian-projected eective gauge theory which was derived by one of the authors.
next (but independently), combining the non-abelian stokes theorem with a novel
reformulation of the yang-mills theory recently proposed by one of the authors, we
proceed to derive the area law of the wilson loop in four-dimensional su(n) yang-
mills theory in the maximal abelian gauge. due to dimensional reduction, the planar
wilson loop in the fundamental representation in four-dimensional su(n) yang-mills
theory can be estimated by the diagonal (abelian) wilson loop dened in the two-
dimensional cp n1 model. this derivation shows that the fundamental quarks are
conned by a single species of magnetic monopole. the non-abelian stokes theorem
extracts the gauge-invariant magnetic monopole contribution and gives the su(n)
generalization of the t hooft-polyakov tensor for the magnetic monopole. an origin
of the area law is related to the geometric phase of the wilczek-zee holonomy for
u(n  1). the calculations are performed by the instanton calculus (in the dilute
instanton-gas approximation) or by the large n expansion (in the leading order).

1 introduction

in the mid-1960s, gell-mann and zweig [1] proposed a model in which all the hadrons
(i.e., baryons and mesons) are composed by the fundamental constituent having frac-
tional charges, (1/3)e or (2/3)e with e being the elementary charge. the predictions
extracted from this model have been consistent with the results of various experiments
performed over the past thirty years. now the fundamental constituent is called the
quark and hence the proposed theory is called the quark model. it is widely believed
that the strong interaction among quarks or anti-quarks is mediated by the gluon
which is described by the quantized yang-mills gauge eld theory [2]. therefore,
the fundamental theory describing the quark and the gluon is given by the quantum
chromodynamics (qcd) which is a non-abelian gauge theory with the gauge group
g = su(3) corresponding to three colors. however, an isolated quark and an isolated
anti-quark have never been observed in experiments. nowadays they are considered
to be conned in the hadrons. this is the hypothesis of quark connement. quark
connement could be explained theoretically within the framework of qcd, although
no one has achieved a rigorous proof of quark connement until now. this is one of
the most principal problems to be resolved in theoretical physics.

qcd has a remarkable property called the asymptotic freedom which was dis-
covered by gross, wilczek and politzer and independently by t hooft [3]. the
asymptotic freedom does not show up in the most successful quantized eld theory,
quantum electrodynamics (qed). as is well known, qed is the abelian gauge theory
for the electron and the photon where the electromagnetic interaction is described by
the quantized maxwell gauge eld theory with a gauge group g = u(1). the asymp-
totic freedom is a consequence of gluon self-interactions. therefore, the asymptotic
freedom is a very characteristic feature of non-abelian gauge theory.

the purpose of this article is to demonstrate quark connement within qcd based
on the wilson criterion for quark connement [4], i.e., area law of the wilson loop.
the wilson loop is a gauge invariant quantity and hence the wilson criterion is also
gauge invariant. the formulation of lattice gauge theory proposed by wilson [4] is
manifestly gauge invariant and does not need the gauge xing. it is easy to show that
the strong coupling expansion in the lattice gauge theory leads to the area law of the
wilson loop. however, this result could not be continued to the weak coupling region
where the string tension is expected to obey the scaling law suggested from the result
of the renormalization group based on the loop calculations. the rst indication of
area law of the wilson loop for arbitrary coupling constant was given by creutz [5]
based on numerical simulations within the lattice gauge theory by for g = su(2) and
su(3). although the numerical evidence of quark connement was indeed a great
progress towards the complete understanding of quark connement, the analytical
proof is still lacking.

this work was initiated to justify the dual superconductor picture of qcd vacuum
proposed in the mid-1970s [6] within the framework of the continuum quantum eld
theory. for the dual superconductivity to occur, magnetic monopoles must be con-
densed, just as the ordinary superconductivity needs condensation of cooper pairs.
in fact, the importance and the validity of taking into account magnetic monopoles in

1

quark connement has been demonstrated at least for the simplied four-dimensional
and lower dimensional models, especially, by polyakov [7], and recently for the four-
dimensional yang-mills theory and qcd with extended supersymmetries by seiberg
and witten [8]. in this scenario quark connement is realized due to condensation
of magnetic monopoles. recent developments of numerical simulations on the lattice
[9] conrm the dual superconductivity in qcd, at least, under a specic gauge xing
called the abelian gauge [10].

this article gives a detailed exposition of the results on quark connement which
were announced in the previous article [11] for g = su(3) together with new results
for g = su(n) with arbitrary n. they are extensions of the analyses of the yang-
mills theory in the maximal abelian (ma) gauge given in a series of articles [12, 13,
14, 15, 16, 17] where the case of su(2) was explicitly worked out. in this process,
we have found that the extension from su(2) to su(3) is non-trivial, but su(3) to
su(n), n > 3 is rather straightforward. new features come out when we begin to
analyze the su(n) case n  3. it seems that they have been overlooked so far in
the conventional approach based on the maximal abelian gauge.
the ma gauge is a partial gauge xing from the original non-abelian gauge group
g to its subgroup h [10] in which the gauge degrees of freedom of the coset g/h is
xed. even after the ma gauge, there is a residual gauge group h which is taken to
be the maximal torus subgroup h = u(1)n1. after the ma gauge, the magnetic
monopole is expected to occur, since the homotopy group 2(g/h) is non-trivial,
i.e.,

2(su(n)/u(1)n1) = 1(u(1)n1) = zn1.

(1.1)
this implies that the breaking of gauge group g  h by partial gauge xing leads
to (n  1) species of magnetic monopoles. however, we do not necessarily need to
take the maximal breaking su(n)  u(1)n1, although the maximal torus group
is desirable as a gauge group of the low-energy eective abelian gauge theory [12].
actually, even if we restrict h to the continuous subgroup 1 of g, there is other
possibilities for choosing h, i.e., we can choose a subgroup h such that

g  h  h := u(1)n1.

(1.2)

the possible number of cases for choosing h increases as n increases. we have
found [11] that the group h may change depending on the representation to which
the quark belongs when n  3, and that it suces to take h = u(n  1) for the
fundamental quark to be conned in the sense of area law of the wilson loop under
the partial gauge xing. here h is equal to the maximal stability group specied by
the highest-weight state of the representation of the quark in the wilson loop. this is
a new feature which does not show up in the su(2) case. nevertheless, this does not
mean that the choice of the maximal torus does not leads to quark connement. in
fact, even if we choose the maximal torus, the area law is derived. this is because the
coset g/ h is contained in g/h, i.e., g/ h  g/h, so that the wilson loop does not
feel the whole of g/h, but only feels the components of g/ h which are contained
1the possibility of discrete subgroup is extensively investigated recently from the viewpoint of

abelian gauge, e.g., the center zn for su (n ), see e.g. [18].

2

in g/h. in other words, the variables belonging to g/h  g/ h are irrelevant for
the expectation value of the wilson loop as can be seen from the non-abelian stokes
theorem (nast) which was announced in [11] and is derived in this article. therefore,
single kind of magnetic monopole is sucient for conning fundamental quark, since

2(su(n)/u(n  1)) = 1(u(1)) = z.

(1.3)

our results show that two partial gauge xings su(3)  u(2) and su(3)  u(1) 
u(1) lead to the same result for connement as far as the fundamental quarks is
concerned. 2

the nast plays the crucial role in this article. the nast have a number of
versions which have already been derived by many authors [20]. a version of nast
derived in this article is based on the idea of dyakonov and petrov [21] who derived
a su(2) version and suggested a way of generalization. we derive a version of nast
based on the coherent state representation [22] on the ag space [23, 24], not based on
the way suggested by them. the coherent state representation was already used in a
dierent fashion to derive a su(2) version of the nast in [15], but the extension to
su(n), n  3 was a non-trivial issue which prevented us from presenting immediate
publication of general su(n) results. the nast is not only mathematically (or
technically) important, but also physically interesting as follows.

first, the nast enables us to write the non-abelian wilson loop,

w c[a] :=

tr(cid:20)p exp(cid:18)igic a(cid:19)(cid:21) ,

1
n

(1.4)

in terms of the abelian-eld strength (curvature two-form) f = da with the abelian
gauge potential (connection one-form) a,

w c[a] = z [d(v )]c exp(cid:18)igic

a(cid:19) = z [d(v )]c exp(cid:18)igzs

f(cid:19) .

(1.5)

combining this fact with the abelian-projected eective gauge theory (apegt) de-
rived in [12], we can explain the abelian dominance [25, 26] in the wilson loop. the
apegt is an abelian gauge theory obtained by integrating out the massive degrees
of freedom, i.e., the o-diagonal gluon gauge eld aa
 with mass ma. hence the
apegt is written in terms of the diagonal massless gauge eld ai
 and the anti-
symmetric (abelian) tensor eld bi
 together with the ghost and anti-ghost elds
c a, c a, where the index i denotes the diagonal components and a the o-diagonal
ones. therefore the apegt is regarded as the low-energy eective theory (leet)
which is valid in the long-distance (or low-energy) region r > m1
a . the abelian
gauge eld bi
 can be identied with
the abelian gauge eld dual to ai
. in fact, we can obtain the theory with an action
s[b] written in terms of bi
 in
apegt and the theory can be rewritten into the dual ginzburg-landau theory, i.e.,
dual abelian higgs theory, provided that the magnetic monopole condensation occurs,

 alone by integrating out all the elds other than bi

 obtained after the hodge decomposition of bi

2see [19] for a result of the simulation on a lattice.

3

i.e., hkki 6= 0. in the dual ginzburg-landau theory, the coupling constant g in the
original theory is replaced by the inverse coupling constant 1/g which is proportional
to the magnetic charge. therefore the dual theory is identied with the magnetic the-
ory. on the other hand, the theory with an action s[a] written in terms of ai alone
is an abelian gauge theory, but the scale dependence of the coupling constant g()
is the same as the original yang-mills theory, i.e., the low-energy eective abelian
gauge theory exhibits asymptotic freedom reproducing the original renormalization-
group beta function (g). this is a manifestation of an approximate weak-strong or
electro-magnetic duality between two low-energy eective theories described by s[a]
and s[b].

next, the nast is able to separate the piece  which corresponds to the mag-
netic monopole in the abelian eld a = c + . indeed, we can write the su(n)
version of the t hooft-polyakov tensor describing the magnetic monopole [27]. so
we can separate the contribution of the magnetic monopole in the area law of the
wilson loop and explain the magnetic monopole dominance in quark connement. in
fact, our derivation of area law estimates only the monopole contribution k = d.
moreover, the nast tells us that the essential ingredient to the area law lies in the
geometric phase which is concerned with the holonomy group of u(n  1). thus
quark connement is intimately related to the geometry of yang-mills gauge theory,
in sharp contrast with the conventional wisdom.

we will present two ways to show the area law of the wilson loop by making
use of the nast. one way is to use the apegt for estimating the diagonal wilson
loop; for suciently large wilson loop (|c|  m1
a ), the expectation value of the
non-abelian wilson loop in yang-mills theory is reduced to that of abelian wilson
loop in apegt, i.e.,

dw c[a]ey m

=d exp(cid:18)igic

a(cid:19)ey m  d exp(cid:18)igic

a(cid:19)eap egt

.

(1.6)

then we can apply the result of [14], i.e., connement in the abelian gauge theory to
show quark connement in yang-mills theory.

another way is to treat the non-abelian gauge theory directly, without going
through the eective abelian gauge theory, based on the novel reformulation of yang-
mills theory in the ma gauge which has been proposed by one of the authors [13]. the
novel reformulation regards the yang-mills theory as the perturbative deformation of
a topological quantum eld theory (tqft). an advantage of this reformulation in
the ma gauge is that the derivation of the area law of the non-abelian wilson loop
in the four-dimensional su(n) yang-mills theory is reduced to that of the diagonal
(abelian) wilson loop in the two-dimensional coset (g/h) non-linear sigma (nls)
model, at least when the wilson loop is planar. therefore the four-dimensional
problem is reduced to the two-dimensional issue. this dimensional reduction is a
remarkable feature of the modied ma gauge 3 caused by hidden supersymmetry.
the yang-mills coupling constant g of the four-dimensional yang-mills theory is

3we must modify the ma gauge slightly in order to keep the supersymmetry where the super-

symmetry is expressed by orthosymplectic group osp(4/2).

traded into the coupling constant in two-dimensional nls model. hence the coupling
constant is expected to run in the same way as the original yang-mills theory, since
the perturbative deformation part provides the necessary running as is well known
by the loop calculation. for the fundamental quark, we are allowed to restrict the
ag space fn1 := su(n)/u(1)n1 to the complex projective space cp n1 :=
su(n)/u(n  1). this greatly simplies the actual treatment.
another advantage of this reduction is that the magnetic monopole contribution to
the wilson loop in the four-dimensional yang-mills theory in the ma gauge is shown
to be equal to the instanton contribution in the corresponding two-dimensional nls
model. indeed, the diagonal wilson loop is written as the area integral of the instan-
ton density k over the area s bounded by the loop c. this correspondence may
shed more light on the strong correlation between magnetic monopoles and instan-
tons observed in the monte carlo simulations, since the two-dimensional instanton is
identied as a subclass of the four-dimensional yang-mills instanton, see e.g. [13].

in this article the expectation value of the wilson loop is estimated by combining
the instanton calculus and the large n expansion, see [28, 29, 30, 31] for reviews of
large n expansion. we focus on the cp n1 model corresponding to the fundamental
quark. first, the instanton calculus is performed within the dilute gas approximation.
it is shown that the calculation in su(n) case is reduced to the su(2) case. it is well
known that the large n expansion is a non-perturbative technique which can be
systematically improved. we derive the area law in the leading order of the large n
expansion, namely, in the region of large n and weak coupling g. we hope that our
derivation of quark connement based on the dimensional reduction and the large n
expansion may shed more light on the relationship between qcd and string theory,
as rst suggested by t hooft [32].

this article is organized as follows. in the former half, we give a derivation of the
nast and discuss its implications. section 2 and 3 are preparations for section 4.
in section 2, we review how to construct the coherent state on the ag space for the
general compact semi-simple group g. in section 3, we present explicit form of the
coherent state on the ag space for g = su(n). we dene the maximal stability
group h which is very important in the following discussions. in section 4, making
use of the results of section 2 and 3, we derive a new version of non-abelian stokes
theorem for g = su(n). although we discuss only the case of su(n) explicitly,
it is straightforward to extend this theorem to arbitrary compact semi-simple group
g. this version of non-abelian stokes theorem is very interesting not only from
the mathematical but also from the physical point of view, since the non-abelian
wilson loop is expressed as the surface integral of the two-form (i.e., the generalized t
hooft-polyakov tensor) which leads to the magnetic monopole. this fact is intimately
related with the abelian and magnetic monopole dominance in quark connement as
discussed in subsequent sections.

in the latter half, we derive area law of the wilson loop. in section 5, we discuss
the magnetic monopole in su(n) yang-mills theory. in order to specify the type of
possible magnetic monopoles, it turns out that the maximal stability group is more
important than the maximal torus group h.
in section 6, abelian dominance in
the wilson loop is shown in the su(n) yang-mills theory in the maximal abelian

5

gauge based on the abelian-projected eective gauge theory and the non-abelian
stokes theorem. in section 7, we briey review a novel reformulation of the yang-
mills theory which has been proposed by one of the authors [13] to derive quark
connement. this reformulation was called the (perturbative) deformation of the
topological quantum eld theory. we apply this reformulation to derive area law of
the wilson loop in su(n) yang-mills theory in section 8 and 9. in section 9, we show
within this reformulation that the area law of the abelian wilson loop in the two-
dimensional nonlinear sigma model for the ag space g/ h is sucient to derive the
area law of the four-dimensional yang-mills theory in the maximal abelian gauge. at
the same time, this derivation leads to the magnetic monopole dominance in the area
law. in section 8, we demonstrate the area law of the wilson loop in the nonlinear
sigma model based on the naive instanton calculus. for the fundamental quark,
we have only to deal with the cp n1 model. in section 9, we derive the area law
based on the large n expansion. these results imply the area law of the non-abelian
wilson loop in the four-dimensional su(n) yang-mills theory. the nal section is
the conclusion of this article.

in appendix a, we give derivations of the inner product of the coherent states
and the invariant measure on the ag space which are presented in section 3.
in
appendix b, we explain how to obtain cp 1 and cp 2 by gluing the complex planes.
in appendix c, we explain two ways to characterize the element of the ag space
and how to write the nls model using these parameterizations. in appendix d, we
summarize the large n expansion of cp n1 model. in appendix e, supplementary
materials on the 1/n expansion are presented.

2 coherent state and maximal stability group

first of all, we construct the coherent state |, i corresponding to the coset repre-
sentatives   g/ h. we follow the method of feng, gilmore and zhang [22]. for
inputs, we prepare
(a) the gauge group 4 g and the lie algebra g of g with the generators {t a} which

obey the commutation relations

[t a, t b] = if ab

ct c,

(2.1)

where f ab
c are the structure constants of the lie algebra. if the lie algebra
is semi-simple, it is more convenient to rewrite the lie algebra in terms of
the cartan basis {hi, e, e}. there are two types of basic operators in the
cartan basis, hi and e. the operators hi may be taken as diagonal, while
e are the o-diagonal shift operators. they obey the commutation relations,

[hi, hj] = 0,

(2.2)

4 note that any compact semi-simple lie group is a direct product of compact simple lie group.
therefore, it is sucient to consider the case of a compact simple lie group. in the following we
assume that g is a compact simple lie group, i.e., a compact lie group with no closed connected
invariant subgroup.

6

[hi, e] = ie,
[e, e] = ihi,

[e, e] =(cid:26) n;e+

( +  6 r,  +  6= 0)

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

,

where r is the root system, i.e., a set of root vectors {1,   , r} with r the
ranks of g;

(b) the hilbert space v  as a carrier (the representation space) of the unitary

irreducible representation  of g;

(c) a reference state |i within the hilbert space v , which can be normalized to

unity, h|i = 1.

we dene the maximal stability subgroup (isotropy subgroup) h as a subgroup of
g that consists of all the group elements h that leave the reference state |i invariant
up to a phase factor, i.e.,
(2.6)

h|i = |iei(h), h  h.

the phase factor is unimportant in the following discussion because we consider
the expectation value of any operators in the coherent state. let h be the cartan
subgroup of g, i.e., the maximal commutative semi-simple subgroup in g and h be
the cartan subalgebra in g, i.e., the lie algebra for group h. the maximal stability
subgroup h includes the cartan subgroup h = u(1)r, i.e., h  h.
for every element g  g, there is a unique decomposition of g into a product of
two group elements,
(2.7)
for g  g. we can obtain a unique coset space g/ h for a given |i. the action of
arbitrary group element g  g on |i is given by

  g/ h,

h  h,

g = h,

g|i = h|i = |iei(h).

(2.8)

the coherent state is constructed as |, i = |i. this denition of the coherent
state is in one-to-one correspondence with the coset space g/ h and the coherent
states preserve all the algebraic and topological properties of the coset space g/ h.
if (g) is hermitian, then hi = hi, and e = e. every group element
g  g can be written as the exponential of a complex linear combination of diagonal
operators hi and o-diagonal shift operators e. let |i be the highest-weight state,
i.e., hj|i = j|i, e|i = 0 for   r+, where r+(r) is a subsystem of positive
(negative) roots. thus the coherent state is given by [22]

|, i = |i = exp

 xr(cid:16)e  e(cid:17)
|i,

  c,

(2.9)

such that

7

(i) |i is annihilated by all the (o-diagonal) shift-up operators e with   r+,

e|i = 0(  r+);

(ii) |i is mapped into itself by all diagonal operators hi, hi|i = i|i;
(iii) |i is annihilated by some shift-down operators e with   r, not by other
and the sum p is restricted to those shift operators e which obey (iii).

e with   r: e|i = 0(some   r); e|i = | + i(some   r);

the coherent states are normalized to unity,

h, |, i = 1.

(2.10)

the coherent state spans the entire space v . however, the coherent state are non-
orthogonal,

by making use of the the group-invariant measure d() of g which is appropriately
normalized, we obtain

h, |, i 6= 0.

(2.11)

z |, id()h, | = i,

(2.12)

which shows that the coherent states are complete, but overcomplete. this resolution
of identity is very important to obtain the path integral formula of the wilson loop
given in section 4.

sentatives   g/ h,

the coherent states |, i are in one-to-one correspondence with the coset repre-
(2.13)

in other words, |, i and   g/ h are topologically equivalent.

|, i  g/ h.

3 flag space and coherent state for su (n )

3.1 su (2) coherent state

in the case of su(2), the maximal stability group agrees with the maximal torus
group u(1) irrespective of the representation. the su(2) case is well known, see e.g.

3.2 su (3) coherent state

for concreteness, we rst focus on the su(3) case. the general su(n) case will be
discussed in the nal part of this section. the highest weight  of the representation
specied by the dynkin index [m, n] (m, n: integers) can be written as

~ = m~h1 + n~h2,

(3.13)

where m, n are non-negative integers for the highest weight and h1, h2 are highest
weights of two fundamental representations of su(3) corresponding to [1, 0], [0, 1]
respectively (see fig.2), i.e.,

therefore, we obtain

~h1 =  1

2

,

1

23! ,

~h2 = 0,

1

3! .

~ =  m

2

,

m + 2n

23 ! .

(3.14)

(3.15)

the generators of su(3) in the cartan basis are written as {h1, h2, e, e, e+,
e, e, e} where ,  are the two simple roots. see fig.3 for the explicit
choice.
if mn = 0, (i.e., m = 0 or n = 0), the maximal stability group h is given
by h = u(2) with generators {h1, h2, e, e} (case (i)). such a degenerate case
occurs when the highest-weight vector ~ is orthogonal to some root vectors. see
fig.2.

if mn 6= 0, i.e., m 6= 0 and n 6= 0, h is the maximal torus group h = u(1) u(1)
therefore, for the highest weight  in the case (i), the coset g/ h is given by

with generators {h1, h2} (case (ii)). this is a non-degenerate case. see fig.4.

su(3)/u(2) = su(3)/(su(2)  u(1)) = cp 2,

whereas in the case (ii)

su(3)/(u(1)  u(1)) = f2.

highest weight of the adjoint representation.

here, cp n is the complex projective space and fn is the ag space [23]. therefore,
the two fundamental representations belong to the case (i), so the maximal stability
group is u(2), rather than the maximal torus group u(1)  u(1). the implications
of this fact to the mechanism of quark connement is discussed in the subsequent
sections.

the coherent state for f2 = su(3)/u(1)2 is given by

the coherent state |, i is normalized, so that h, |, i = 1. we show in appendix
a that the inner product is given by

h, |, i = ek(w, w)e 1

(3.22)

note that k(w, w) reduces to the kahler potential k(w, w) when w = w, in agree-
ment with the normalization. it follows from the general formula (see su(n) case)

(3.27)

(3.28)

the complex projective space cp 2 is covered by three complex plane c by holomor-
phic maps [33], see appendix b. the parameterization of su(3) in terms of eight
angles is possible also in su(3), just as su(2) is parameterized by three euler angles,
see [34].

3.3 su (n ) case

for su(n) = su(n + 1), the ag space [23] is dened by

fn = su(n + 1)/u(1)n  v.

(3.29)

we use v to denote the element of fn in this denition. fn is a compact kahler
manifold [35, 36] which is homogeneous but nonsymmetrical manifold of dimension
dimcfn = n(n + 1)/2.

since the ag manifold fn is a kahler manifold [35, 36], it possesses complex local

coordinates w, an hermitian riemannian metric,

5 we take the notation ei for the corresponding root vectors (i) in fig.3

ds2 = g dwd w,

(3.30)

13

and a corresponding two-form, called the kahler form 6

which is closed, i.e.,

k = ig dw  d w,

dk = 0.

(3.31)

(3.32)

any closed form k is locally exact, k = d due to poincares lemma. the condition
(3.32) is equivalent to

g 
w =

g 
w ,

or

g 
 w =

g
 w .

(3.33)

this holds if and only if the metric g is obtained from a real scalar function k as

g  =



w


 w k,

(3.34)

where k = k(w, w) is called the kahler potential. then the kahler two-form is
obtained from (3.31),

k = i k.

(3.35)

on the ag space, there transitively act two groups g = su(n + 1) and also
its complexication gc = sl(n + 1, c). any element of fn is written as an upper
triangular matrix of the size (n + 1)  (n + 1), with ones in the main diagonal and
o-diagonal n(n + 1)/2 complex numbers, w  c:

 fn.

(3.36)

 =

therefore, we can write

fn = sl(n + 1, c)/b  ,

(3.37)

where b(b+) is the borel subgroup, i.e., the group of lower (upper) triangular
matrices with determinant equal to one (iwasawa decomposition). this denition
(3.37) 7 should be compared with the rst denition (3.29). the mapping g/h 
gc/b is a generalization of the stereographic projection in the g = su(2) case [13].
the action of the group sl(n + 1, c) on fn, g : v  vg, can be found through the
gauss decomposition:

v  g = t dvg,
6the imaginary unit is needed to make the kahler two-form real, since g  = g  = g .
7note that  is not necessarily unitary as a matrix under this denition.

g  sl(n + 1, c), t  z(n + 1),

vg  z+(n + 1),

(3.38)

14

where z+(n + 1)(z(n + 1)) is the set of the upper (lower) triangular matrices with
units on the main diagonal and d is a diagonal matrix with determinant equal to 1.
the elements of the factors t, d, vg are rational functions of the elements of g. 8

the group g = su(n) has the rank n  1 and the cartan subalgebra is con-
structed from (n 1) diagonal generators hi. hence, there are n(n 1) o-diagonal
shift operators e, since dimsu(n) := n 2  1 = (n  1) + n(n  1). therefore,
the total number of roots is n(n  1), of which there are n  1 simple roots, other
roots are constructed as linear combination of the simple roots. there are n weight
vectors. an element of su(n) is expressed by the n  n unitary matrices with
unit determinant which is generated by traceless hermitian matrices, n 2  1 linearly
independent generators t a(a = 1,   , n 2  1). the generators are normalized as

(3.40)
each o-diagonal generator e has a single non-zero element 1/2. the diagonal
generator hm is dened by

ab.

for m = 1 to n  1, hm has m 1s along the diagonal from upper left-hand corner.
the next element is m to make it traceless. the rest of the diagonal elements (if
any) are zero. the weight vector (i.e., eigenvectors of all hi, hj|i = j|i) of the
fundamental representation n (n-dimensional irreducible representation of su(n))
is given by [37]

as can be shown from (3.44), all these roots have length 1, and angles between
successive roots are the same, 2/3, and other roots are orthogonal, i.e.,

1
j  j = 1, i  j = 
2
i  j = 0

(j = i  1),
(j 6= i, i  1)

(3.48)

(3.49)

this fact is usually expressed as the dynkin diagram, see fig.5.

if we choose 1 as the highest-weight ~ of the fundamental representation n, some
of the roots are orthogonal to 1. from the above construction, it is easy to see that

16

1

2

figure 5: the dynkin diagram of su(n).

only one simple root 1 is non-orthogonal to 1, and that all the other simple roots
are orthogonal, i.e.,

1  1 6= 0,

1  2 = 1  3 =    = 1  n1 = 0.

(3.50)

so all the linear combinations constructed from 2,   , n1 are also orthogonal
to 1. non-orthogonal roots are obtained only when 1 is included in the linear
combinations.
it is not dicult to show that the total number of non-orthogonal
roots is 2(n  1), so there are n(n  1)  2(n  1) = (n  2)(n  1) orthogonal
roots. the (n  2)(n  1) shift operators e corresponding to these orthogonal roots
together with n  1 cartan subalgebra hi constitute the maximal stability subgroup
h = u(n  1), since (n  2)(n  1) + (n  1) = (n  1)2 = dimu(n  1). thus,
for the fundamental representation, the stability subgroup h of su(n) is given by
h = u(n  1). in order to describe the coset space g/ h, we need only (n  1)
complex numbers, since
(3.51)
and dimg/ h = 2(n 1). we conclude that g/ h = cp n1, the (n 1)-dimensional
complex projective space [35, 36, 33, 38] which is a submanifold of the ag manifold
fn1.
the complex projective space cp n is the compact kahler symmetric space with
dimccp n = n. the su(n+1) group can transitively act on this manifold and this
manifold can be considered as a factor space,

g/ h = su(n)/u(n  1),

cp n = su(n + 1)/(su(n)  u(1)).

the kahler potential of fn (n = n  1) is obtained as follows. let h be the
hermitian matrix dened by h = v v , v  fn. consider the gauss decomposition
(3.54)

h = v v  = t dv,

where t  z(n + 1) and d is a diagonal matrix with determinant equal to 1. h has
the upper principal minors (v v )( = 1,   , n + 1) which is equal to the following
products of the elements  of the diagonal matrix d = diag(1,   , n):
   , n = 12    n, n+1 = 1.

1 = 1, 2 = 12,

(3.55)

let d ( = 1,   , n) be the dynkin index of su(n + 1). then the kahler potential
of fn is given in the form,

the above construction of the coherent state can be extended into arbitrary com-

pact semi-simple lie group, see chapter 11 of perelomov [40].

4 non-abelian stokes theorem

in this section we derive a new version of non-abelian stokes theorem (nast) based
on the coherent state obtained in the previous section. an advantage of this version
of nast is that it is possible to separate the magnetic monopole contribution in the
wilson loop and that it is very helpful to understand the dual superconductor picture
of quark connement in qcd.

4.1 non-abelian stokes theorem for su (n )

we consider the innitesimal deviation  =  + d (which is sucient to derive the
path integral formula). from (3.19), i.e.,

|, i = |i = e 1

2 k(w, w) exp"x

(w)e#|i,

we nd

h + d, |, i = exp[i + o((dw)2)],
:= h|i(x)d(x)|i,

(x)

where d denotes an exterior derivative,

d := dx 

x := dx.

then  is the one-form,

 = dx,  = h|i(x)(x)|i.

(4.1)

(4.2)
(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

here the x-dependence of  comes through that of w(x) (the local eld variable w(x)),
i.e., (x) = (w(x)).

the exterior derivative is also regarded as the operator,

d =  +  = dw



w

(4.6)

where the operators  and  are called the dolbeault operators [35]. from the inner
product (3.22),

consider a curve starting from x0 and ending at x. we parameterize the curve by

this implies [21] that it is possible to write the path integral representation of the
wilson loop operator if we identify a(t) with the hamiltonian,

h(t) = ga(t) = ga(x)dx/dt.

(4.16)

20

following [15], the path-ordered exponent is dened by discretizing the time interval
t into n innitesimal steps and subsequently taking the limit n  ,   0 with
n = t being kept xed,

and insert the complete set (resolution of unity),

since the identity d2 = 0 leads to 2 = 0 = 2,   +  = 0. therefore, the second

4.2 fundamental representation of su (n ) and cp n1 vari-

we can write

a(x) := (v (x)|i)a

(a = 1,   , n),

na(x) := h|v (x)t av (x)|i = a(x)(t a)abb(x).

(4.33)

(4.34)

in the cp n1 case, especially, the highest-weight state is given by a column vector,

|i =


1
0
...
0




,

and then we can write

na(x) := h|u(x)t au(x)|i = a(x)(t a)abb(x),

where u  su(n) and

then na(x) can be rewritten into

a(x)

:= (u(x)|i)a = u1a(x).

na(x) = (u(x)t au(x))11.

(4.35)

(4.36)

(4.37)

(4.38)

note that the cp n1 variables a(a = 1,   , n) are subject to the constraint,

n

xa=1|a(x)|2 = 1.
this is clearly satised by the unitarity of u,pn

a=1 u1a(x) u1a(x) = (u(x)u(x))11 = 1.
on the other hand, we examine another expression (adjoint orbit representation),

(4.39)

na(x) = 2tr(u(x)hu(x)t a),

n(x) := na(x)t a = u(x)hu(x),

or equivalently,

(4.44)

note that two elements agree with each other. hence the adjoint orbit can not cover
all the ag space f2. this is the cp 2 case. it is easy to see that two denitions (4.36)
and (4.40) are equivalent,

na(x) = (u(x)t au(x))11 = 2tr(hu(x)t au(x)),

(4.45)

since ut au is traceless. 9

a correspondence between the fn1 variables wa and the cp n1 variables a is

given, e.g., by

1 = w1, 2 = w2,   , n1 = wn1, n = 1,

(4.46)
i.e.,  is the inhomogeneous coordinate, a = a/n = wa (a = 1,   , n  1) by
denition. in the cp n1 case (for the fundamental representation), we can perform
the following replacement,

if f (v ) is traceless, i.e., trf (v ) = 0. hence, we obtain another expression for ,

h|f (v )|i = 2tr[hf (u)],

(4.47)

(x) := 2tr[hiu(x)du(x)] = i2tr[hdu(x)u(x)],

which is a diagonal piece of the maurer-cartan one-form,

 := duu1.

(4.48)

(4.49)

it turns out that the two-form k is the symplectic two-form [43],
k = d = 2tr(h[u1du, u1du]) = 2tr(n[dn, dn]).

(4.50)
our choice of h is the most economical one, see [43] for dierent choices and more
arguments on the related issues.
from the kahler potential of cp n1 (3.61) and the relation (4.8), the connection

one-form  reads

which is equal to

up to the total derivative. by taking the exterior derivative, we obtain

dw  d w,

which agrees with the metric (3.63).

(4.51)

(4.52)

(4.53)

9when [m, n] = [1, 1], on the other hand, h = diag(1,1, 0), and all the diagonal elements are

dierent. therefore n(x) moves on the whole ag space, f2.

24

4.3 an implication of the nast

the nast (4.27) implies that the wilson loop operator is given by

w c[a] =z [d()]c exp(cid:18)igic

a(cid:19) =z [d()]c exp(cid:18)igzs:c=s

f(cid:19) .

first, a is the connection one-form,

a := naaa +

1
g

 = h|av |i,

where av is the gauge transformation of a by v  fn1,
i
g

v dv  = a +

d.

av := v av  +

i
g

for quark in the fundamental representation, we can write

a = 2tr(hav ).

(4.54)

(4.55)

(4.56)

(4.57)

therefore, the one-form a is equal to the diagonal piece of the gauge-transformed
potential av . this fact is very useful to derive the abelian dominance in the low-
energy physics of qcd, see section 6.
next, f is the curvature two-form,

f := da = dc +

1
g

d = dc +

1
g

k,

where we dened the one-form,

c := naaa.

(4.58)

(4.59)

the anti-symmetric tensor f can be called the generalized t hooft-polyakov tensor
by the following reasons; (1) it gives non-vanishing magnetic monopole (current)
where only the second term k gives a non-trivial contribution. (2) it is invariant
under the full gauge transformation, although it is an abelian eld strength. these
facts are shown as follows.

first of all, we characterize the ag space in the complex coordinates, namely,
the target space at each space-time point x  rd is parameterized by the complex
variables, w = w(x). the kahler two-form is rewritten as

k = ig w wdx  dx.

on the other hand,

k := d =

1
2

(  )dx  dx :=

g
2

f 
dx  dx.

then the second piece g1k of f is written as

f 
 =

1
g

(  ) =

i
g

g w w,

25

(4.60)

(4.61)

(4.62)

and hence

f = c  c + f 
.

(4.63)

the magnetic monopole current k is obtained as the divergence of the dual tensor
f 
,

k := f,

(4.64)

(4.65)

where the hodge dual of f in four dimensions is dened by

f :=

1
2

f.

the rst piece dc in f does not contribute to the magnetic current, due to the bianchi
identity. on the other hand, the second term k in f can lead to the non-vanishing
magnetic current, as shown shortly. here it should be remarked that the expression
for k given in terms of the local coordinate w leads to vanishing magnetic current.
in fact, if the metric is given by the kahler potential,

(4.66)

where we have used the antisymmetric property of  under the exchange of  and
, and  and . however, this does not imply the vanishing total magnetic ux or
magnetic charge.

we recall that this situation is similar to that of wu-yang monopole [45] compared
with the original dirac monopole [44]. there are two ways for describing the dirac
magnetic monopole. one is to use a single vector potential with (line) singularities
called the dirac string where the singularities are distributed on a semi-innite line
extending from the origin of the space coordinates. in the absence of singularities,
the vector potential gives vanishing magnetic charge, due to bianchi identity,

 = is2

b  ds = is2

curla  ds = zd3

divcurladv = 0.

(4.67)

therefore, the singularities must produce the magnetic charge which has the same
magnitude as the magnetic charge at the origin, but the opposite sign. another way
is to introduce more than one vector potential to avoid singularities. each vector
potential a is dened in a subregion u of the sphere s2 such that a is regular
in each region u and the union of the subregions covers the whole sphere, i.e.,
s2  u. therefore, the bianchi identity leads to zero magnetic ux in each
subregion. note that we can not apply the gauss theorem divcurla = 0, since u
is not a closed surface. the total magnetic ux is recovered by summing up all the

26

contributions of the dierence of two vector potentials on the boundary b, shared
by two regions, u and u,

 =x iu

curla  ds =x,ib,

(a  a)d,

(4.68)

where the minus sign follows from the fact that the orientation of the boundary is
opposite for the neighboring regions. the dierence is given by the gauge transforma-
tion, a(x) a(x) = ,(x). this recovers the same magnetic ux as the former
case.
in view of this, the variable w corresponds to a in the wu-yang monopole.
therefore, to show the existence of non-zero magnetic ux, we must specify how to
glue dierent coordinates patches on the boundary. these subtleties are avoided by
using dierent parameterization. this generalizes the argument given by t hooft and
polyakov for the su(2) magnetic monopole. the antisymmetric tensor f given by
(4.58) is the su(n) generalization of the t hooft-polyakov tensor for su(2). in the
su(2) case, a = 2tr(t 3av ) for any representation and the two-form f := da is the
abelian eld strength which is invariant under the su(2) transformation. hence the
two-form f is nothing but the t hooft-polyakov tensor

the invariance of f is obvious from the nast (4.54), since w c[a] is gauge invariant
and the measure [d()]c is also invariant under the g gauge transformation. in the
case of fundamental representation, the invariance is easily seen, because it is possible
to rewrite (4.58) or (4.75) into the manifestly gauge invariant form [46]:

5 magnetic monopole in su(n) yang-mills theory

in the dual superconductor picture of quark connement, the magnetic monopoles give
the dominant contribution to the area law of the wilson loop or the string tension.
following the t hooft argument [10], the partial gauge xing g  h realizes the
magnetic monopole in yang-mills gauge theory even in the absence of elementary
scalar eld. in the conventional approach based on the ma gauge, the residual gauge
group was chosen to be the maximal torus subgroup h = u(1)n1 for g = su(n).
this choice immediately determines the type of magnetic monopoles. we re-examine
this issue. we have learned that the magnetic monopole which is responsible for area
law of the wilson loop is determined by the maximal stability group h rather than
the residual gauge group h. this is a new feature appeared in su(n), n  3. it
seems that this possibility has been overlooked so far in the lattice community as
far as i know. indeed, this situation occurs only for su(n), n  3. therefore, we

29

must distinguish the maximal stability group h from the residual gauge group h. in
general, the maximal stability group h is larger than the maximal torus subgroup,
h = u(1)n1  h. so, the coset space is smaller than the maximal torus case, i.e.,
g/ h  g/h.
the existence of magnetic monopole is suggested from the non-trivial homotopy
groups 2(g/h). in the case (ii),

2(f2) = 2(su(3)/(u(1)  u(1))) = 1(u(1)  u(1)) = z + z.

(5.1)

on the other hand, in the case (i), i.e., [m,0] or [0,n]

2(cp 2) = 2(su(3)/u(2)) = 1(u(2)) = 1(su(2)  u(1)) = 1(u(1)) = z. (5.2)
note that cp n1 model has only the local u(1) invariance for any n  2.
it is
this u(1) invariance that corresponds to a single kind of abelian magnetic monopole
appearing in the case (i). this magnetic monopole may be related to the non-abelian
magnetic monopole proposed by e. weinberg et al. [47]. the explicit solution for the
magnetic monopole in su(3) gauge theories were discussed in [48].

this situation should be compared with the su(2) case where the maximal sta-
bility group is always given by the maximal torus h = u(1) irrespective of the
representation. therefore, the coset is given by

g/h = su(2)/u(1) = f1 = cp 1 = s2 = so(3)

and

2(su(2)/u(1)) = 2(f1) = 2(cp 1) = z,

for arbitrary representation.

(5.3)

(5.4)

for su(n), our results suggest that the fundamental quarks are to be conned

when the maximal stability group h is given by h = u(n  1) and
2(g/ h) = 2(su(n)/u(n  1)) = 2(cp n1) = z,

while the adjoint quark is related to the maximal torus h = u(1)n1 and

2(g/h) = 2(su(n)/u(1)n1) = 2(fn1) = zn1.

(5.5)

(5.6)

this observation is in sharp contrast with the conventional treatment in which the
(n  1) species of magnetic monopoles corresponding to the residual maximal torus
group u(1)n1 of g = su(n) were taken into account on equal footing. in fact, the
nast derived in this article shows that the fundamental quark feels only the u(1)
which is embedded in the maximal stability group u(n  1) as a magnetic monopole.
this is a component along the highest-weight.

6 abelian dominance in su(n) gauge theory

30

6.1 apegt as a low-energy eective theory

the abelian dominance in su(n) yang-mills theory can be explained as follows.
first of all, we adopt the maximal abelian (ma) gauge. the ma gauge for su(n)
is dened as follows. consider the cartan decomposition of a into the diagonal (h)
and o-diagonal (g/h) pieces,

a(x) = aa(x)t a = ai(x)h i + aa(x)t a,

(a = 1,   , n 2  1).

(6.1)

especially, for g = su(3),

h 1 =

3
2

, h 2 =

8
2

, t a =

a
2

(a = 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7).

(6.2)

the ma gauge is obtained by minimizing the functional of o-diagonal elds,

r := z d4x

1
2

aa

(x)aa

(x) :=z d4xtrg/h (a(x)a(x)),

(6.3)

under the gauge transformation. under the innitesimal gauge transformation , r
transforms as

r = z d4xaa
= z d4xaa
= z d4x(aa

(a + gf aijai

j + gf aibai

b + gf abcab

c)

 + gf aibai

ab

)a,

(6.4)

since f abc is completely antisymmetric in the indices and f aij = 0 (t i and t j
are commutable). therefore, the condition r = 0 for arbitrary  leads to the
dierential ma gauge given by

aa

(x)  gf abiai

(x)ab

(x) := (d[a]a)a = 0.

the su(n) yang-mills theory in ma gauge is given by

(6.10)

now we proceed to derive the eective abelian gauge theory in the ma gauge by
integrating out the o-diagonal gauge elds (together with the ghost and anti-ghost
elds), aa, c a, c a, ba [49, 12]. then the su(n) yang-mills theory can be reduced
to the u(1)n1 abelian gauge theory which is written in terms of the diagonal elds
alone, ai, c i, c i, bi.

zy m [j] = z [dai][dc i][d c i][dbi] exp(stotal

ap egt  sj ),

where

exp(stotal

ap egt  sj) = z [daa][dc a][d c a][dba] exp(stotal

y m  sj ).

in particular, the partition function reads

zy m [0] = z [dai][dc i][d c i][dbi] exp(stotal

ap egt ) := zap egt .

(6.11)

(6.12)

(6.13)

the abelian gauge theory obtained in this way was called the abelian-projected
eective gauge theory (apegt). it has been shown that the apegt is an abelian
gauge theory with the gauge coupling constant g which runs according to the same
renormalization-group beta function as the original su(n) yang-mills theory,

(6.16)

(6.18)

the apegt obtained in this way can be regarded as the low-energy eective
gauge theory of yang-mills theory. in the ma gauge, the o-diagonal gauge elds
aa
 have the non-zero mass ma, ma 6= 0, whereas the diagonal gauge elds ai
 remain
massless, ma = 0. this was conrmed by monte carlo simulation on a lattice by
amemiya and suganuma [51] for g = su(2) and su(3). the non-zero mass of the

11 the result of [49, 12] for su(2) can be generalized to su(n) in the straightforward way, at least
in one-loop level [50]. in the two-loop level, it is not trivial. the two-loop result will be given in
[50].

o-diagonal pieces was shown analytically at least in the topological sector, based
on the dimensional reduction to the two-dimensional coset non-linear sigma model,
see section iv.c of [13]. more details will be given in a subsequent article [42].
therefore, integration of the massive o-diagonal gauge elds is interpreted as a step
of the wilsonian renormalization group. 12 if so, the apegt can describe the low-
energy physics in the length scale r > m1
a . in this sense, the apegt is regarded
as the low-energy eective gauge theory of yang-mills theory.

6.2 abelian dominance

by virtue of the nast for su(n) just derived, abelian dominance in su(n) yang-
mills theory is explained as follows, based on the same argument as the su(2) case.13
the nast (4.27) implies that the expectation value of the wilson loop in the su(n)
yang-mills theory is given by

hw c[a]iy m = z [d(v )]cd exp(cid:18)igic

a(cid:19)ey m

,

where the one-form a is written as

a = 2tr(hav ),

(6.19)

(6.20)

for quark in the fundamental representation. so, the one-form a is equal to the
diagonal piece of the gauge-transformed potential av , i.e., a component along the
highest-weight vector of the fundamental representation of su(n). 14 by applying
the above result (6.18) to (6.19), we obtain

dw c[a]ey m

= d exp(cid:18)igic
= d exp(cid:18)igic

a(cid:19)ey m
a(cid:19)eap egt

= z1

ap egt z [dai][dc i][d c i][dbi] exp(stotal

ap egt [ai]) exp(cid:18)igic

(6.21)

(6.22)

(6.23)

a(cid:19) ,

where we have used in the rst equality the fact that the the integration over v is
redundant after having taken the expectation value hiy m . this implies the abelian
dominance for the large wilson loop in su(n) gauge theory in the sense that the

12rigorously speaking, all high-energy modes should be integrated out in the wilsonian renormal-
ization group. so, we must integrate out the high-energy mode of the diagonal elds ai
 too. the
result is the same as the above, at least in the one-loop level. in the two-loop level, we must be
more careful in dealing with the high-energy mode, see [50].

13 the abelian dominance in the low-energy region of su(2) qcd was already shown in [15] based
on the result [12] combined with the su(2) nast [21, 15]. the monopole dominance was derived for
su (2) in [15] by showing that the dominant contribution to the area law comes from the monopole
piece alone, k = d = tr(n[dn, dn]).

14 therefore, the component a along the highest-weight is obtained as an appropriate linear
combination of ai. other components orthogonal to the highest-weight dont contribute to the
expectation value of the wilson loop, since the apegt (6.14) is an abelian gauge theory without
self-interaction among the gauge elds.

33

expectation value of the non-abelian wilson loop in yang-mills theory is nearly equal
to (or dominated by) that of the abelian wilson loop in the apegt where the wilson
loop c is so large that the apegt is valid in that region, i.e., . r, t > m1
a for
a rectangular wilson loop with sides r and t . the apegt is valid in the range
qcd <   r1 < ma.

6.3 monopole dominance and area law

in our framework, the abelian dominance and the monopole dominance are under-
stood as implying the rst and the second equality respectively,

dw c[a]ey m = d exp(cid:18)igic
= d exp(cid:18)iic

a(cid:19)eap egt
(cid:19)eap egt

.

(6.24)

(6.25)

numerical simulations show that the monopole part exhibits the area law and abel
exhausts the full string tension obtained from the non-abelian wilson loop (i.e.,
monopole dominance in the string tension or area law),

d exp(cid:18)iic

(cid:19)eap egt  exp(abel|s|),

(6.26)

whiled exp (ighc a  ihc )eap egt

that the area law of the original non-abelian wilson loop,

does not exhibits the area law. this result implies

dw c[a]ey m  exp(|s|)  = abel.

(6.27)

in [16], the monopole dominance and the area law of the wilson loop have been
shown based on the apegt for g = su(2). now this scenario can be extended into
g = su(n). the important remarks are in order,

1. the apegt has a running coupling constant which increases as the relevant
energy decreases (asymptotic freedom), so the apegt is in the strong coupling
region in the low-energy regime. see fig.6

2. the abelian gauge group in apegt is a compact group embedded in the
compact non-abelian gauge group su(n). it is the compactness that causes
the phase transition in the apegt at

c =


4

,

(6.28)

which separates the coulomb (conformal) phase ( < c) from the strong
coupling phase ( > c). this follows from the berezinski-kosterlitz-thouless
(bkt) phase transition in the two-dimensional o(2) nls model obtained by
the dimensional reduction.

3. in the low-energy region such that () > c, the apegt is in the strong

7 reformulation of yang-mills theory

in this section we summarize a novel reformulation of the yang-mills theory which was
proposed in [13] and elaborated in [17]. this material is necessary in the subsequent
sections.

7.1 deformation of topological eld theory

we consider the quantization of yang-mills theory on the topological background
eld. we decompose the connection a into

a(x) = (x) + q(x),

(7.1)

and identify q with the quantum uctuation eld on the background eld . for
arbitrary but xed background eld , the generating functional is given by

z[j, ]

:= z [dq][d c][d c][d b] expnisy m [ + q] + i sgf [q, c, c, b] + i(j  q)o ,(7.2)

where sy m [a] is the usual yang-mills action,

sy m [a] = z ddx

1
4f[a]f[a],

(7.3)

and sgf is the gauge-xing and fp ghost term for the quantum uctuation eld q,
(7.4)

:= z ddx ib trg(cid:20) c(cid:18) f [q] +

sgf [q, c, c, b]


2

b(cid:19)(cid:21) .

we wish to retain the gauge invariance for the background eld  even after the
gauge xing for q. this is realized by choosing the background eld (bgf) gauge
xing condition,

f a[q] := dab

 []qb

 = 0.

(7.5)

in fact, in the bgf gauge, z[j, ] is invariant under the gauge transformation of
the background eld; the innitesimal version is given by  = d[]. hence, the
theory with the action,

sef f [j, ] := i ln z[j, ],

(7.6)

is dened only on the space of gauge orbit. suppose that the background eld satises
the equation, f a[] = 0. in order to consider the quantized yang-mills theory on all
possible background elds satisfying the equations f a[] = 0, we dene the total
generating functional

z[j]

= z [d][dc][d c][db] z[j, ] exp(ist qf t [, c, c, b]) exp[i(j  )]
= z [d][dc][d c][db] exp{i sef f [j, ] + ist qf t [, c, c, b] + i(j  )},(7.8)

(7.7)

where st qf t [, c, c, b] corresponds to the gauge-xing term for the background
eld . in order to describe the magnetic monopole as a topological background
eld in yang-mills theory, we choose the ma gauge for , i.e.,

st qf t [, c, c, b]

:= z ddx ib trg/h(cid:20) c(cid:18)f [] +


2

b(cid:19)(cid:21) ,

(7.9)

36

where

f a[] := d

ab[i]b

 := (ab  gf abi

i)b


(i = 1,   , n  1).

(7.10)

note that the trace is taken on the coset g/h, not on the entire g, in the ma gauge.

under the identication,

(x) :=

i
g

u(x)u(x), q(x) := u(x)v(x)u(x),

(7.11)

we assume that all the topologically non-trivial congurations come from , whereas v
denotes the topologically trivial congurations. therefore, v changes under the small
gauge transformation, while  includes the eect of large gauge transformations, so
we must take into account the nite gauge rotation u, without restricting to the
innitesimal gauge transformation. under this identication (7.11), the yang-mills
action is invariant,

sy m [a] = sy m [ + q] = sy m [v] =z ddx

1
4f[v]f[v],

while the gauge-xing term (7.4) is changed [17] into

sgf [v, , , ]

:= z ddx ib trg(cid:20)(cid:18)v +


2

(cid:19)(cid:21) .

(7.12)

(7.13)

this implies that the background gauge for q is changed into the lorentz gauge for
v, v = 0. then the generating functional in the background eld  is cast into
z[j, ] = z [dv][d][d][d] expni[sy m [v] + sgf [v, , , ] + (j  uvu)]o(7.14)
where v, , ,  are dened by the adjoint rotation of q, c, c, b respectively,

v := uqu,

 := u cu,

 := u cu,

 := u bu.

(7.15)

thus the total generating functional reads

z[j]

= z [du][dc][d c][db] z[j, ] exp(isgf [, c, c, b]) exp[i(j  )]
= z [du][dc][d c][db] exp{i sef f [j, ] + ist qf t [, c, c, b] + i(j  )},(7.17)

(7.16)

where we have made the change of variable from  to u. the measure [du] is invariant
under the multiplication,

which leads to the nite gauge transformation of the background eld,

u(x)  u (x)u(x),

(x)  u (x)(x) u(x) +

i
g

u (x)d u(x).

37

(7.18)

(7.19)

it is more ecient to modify the ma gauge into the osp(d/2) invariant form [13],

st qf t [, c, c, b] := zrd

ddx ib btrg/h(cid:20) 1

2

(x)(x) + ic(x) c(x)(cid:21) ,

(7.20)

by making use of the brst b and anti-brst b transformations, see [13] for de-
tails.15

the expectation value of the functional f (a) of a is calculated as follows. if it is

in the form, f (a) = g(v, u)h(u), then
hf (a)iy m = hhg(v, u)h(u)ivpy miu

t qf t = hhg(v, u)ivpy m h(u)iu

t qf t ,

(7.21)

where the sector of the perturbative deformation is dened by

h(  )ivpy m = z1

py m z [dv][d][d][d] expni(sy m [v] + sgf [v, , , ])o (  ), (7.22)
zpy m :=z [dv][d][d][d] expni(sy m [v] + sgf [v, , , ])o ,(7.23)

and the sector topological eld theory is dened by

h(  )iu

t qf t := z1

t qf t z [du][dc][d c][db] exp{ist qf t [, c, c, b]}(  ),
zt qf t :=z [du][dc][d c][db] exp{ist qf t [, c, c, b]}.

(7.24)

(7.25)

this reformulation of the yang-mills theory was called the perturbative deformation
of a topological quantum eld theory. the expectation value h(  )ivpy m for the eld
v is calculated in the perturbation theory in the coupling constant g. on the other
hand, the expectation value h(  )iu
t qf t should be calculated in a non-perturbative
way to incorporate the topological contribution. here u is a compact gauge variable
corresponding to nite gauge transformation.
in the instanton calculus, the inte-
gration measure [du] is replaced with the (nite-dimensional) integration over the
collective coordinates of the instanton.

7.2 dimensional reduction to nls model in the ma gauge

it is shown [13] that, due to the hidden supersymmetry, osp(d/2), the tqft part
(7.20) is reduced to the (d  2)-dimensional coset (g/h) nonlinear sigma (nls)
model,

sn lsm [u, c, c] := 2zrd2

dd2x trg/h(cid:20) 1

2

(x)(x) + ic(x) c(x)(cid:21) ,

(7.26)

15 note that (7.20) is obtained from (7.9) by adding the ghost self-interaction terms and choosing

 = 2, since

the last two terms reduce to 2ic1c2c3 = 2c3c+c for g = su (2) in agreement with the result [13].

8 area law of the wilson loop (i)

in this section we derive the area law of the wilson loop based on the instanton
calculus [52, 53, 54]. more systematic estimation will be given in the next section
based on the large n expansion.

the static potential v (r) is evaluated from the rectangular wilson loop c with

sides t and r according to

v (r) :=  lim
t

(8.1)

the (full) string tension  is dened by

a(c)

lnhw c[a]iy m4,

(8.2)

where a(c) is the minimal area of the surface spanned by the wilson loop c. of
course, the rectangular loop has the minimal area, a(c) = t r.

using the nast for the wilson loop operator,

w c[a] = z [d()]c exp(cid:18)igic

naaa + iic

(cid:19) ,

we can write its expectation value in the yang-mills theory as [15, 17]

the nite action conguration of the coset nls model is provided by the instanton

that the integer-valued topological charge q of the instanton in the fn1 nls model

8.3 area law in the dilute instanton-gas approximation

in (8.16) counts the number of instantons nin
contained inside the area s  r2 bounded by the loop c, i.e.,

which are

see fig.7. thus, the expectation value d exp (irs k)en lsm

is calculated by sum-
ming over all the possible cases of instanton and anti-instanton congurations (i.e.,
by the integration over the instanton moduli). in this calculation, we use

(8.34)

+ (nout


where nout
) is the number of instantons (anti-instantons) outside s and n+ (n)
is the total number of instantons (anti-instantons). for the quark in the fundamental
representation n (d1 = 1, d2 = d3 =    = dn1 = 0), this is easily performed as
follows.
for the su(3) case with [1, 0], an element   f2 is independent of w3, so that
w3 is redundant in this case. hence, it suces to consider the cp 2 model for the
fundamental quark (up to weyl symmetry). for cp 2, the kahler two-form is given
by (4.87),

k = im(1)2[(1 + |w1|2)dw2  d w2  w2w1dw2  d w1

w2 w1dw1  d w2 + (1 + |w2|2)dw1  d w1].

when w2 = 0, k reduces to

similarly, when w1 = 0,

k = i(1 + |w1|2)2dw1  d w1.

k = i(1 + |w2|2)2dw2  d w2.

(8.35)

(8.36)

(8.37)

for a polynomial w = w(z) in z = x + iy with an order n, we nd an instanton
charge,

z k = q, q  z.

(8.39)

[13, 15]. thus the
where j = 1/2 corresponds to the fundamental representation.
wilson loop is estimated by the naive instanton calculus. in fact, the dilute instanton
gas approximation leads to the area law for the wilson loop, see [13]. here the factor
 is very important. the integral of kahler two-form k is multiple of . if we had
a factor 2, the area law was lost, just as the j = 1 case of su(2).

for the su(n) case with dynkin index, [1, 0,   , 0], it suces to consider the
cp n1 model. when wa 6= 0 and wb = 0 for all b 6= a, the kahler two-form (4.53)
for cp n1 reduces to
(8.40)

k = i(1 + |wa|2)2dwa  d wa,

with no summation over a. therefore the above argument can be applied to any n of
su(n). this implies connement of fundamental quarks in su(n) yang-mills theory
within the approximation of dilute instanton gas. this naive instanton calculation
can be improved by including uctuations from the instanton solutions following [54]
and this issue will be discussed in detail in the subsequent article [42].

9 area law of the wilson loop (ii)

the derivation of the area law of the wilson loop in the four-dimensional yang-mills
theory in the ma gauge is reduced to showing area law of the diagonal wilson loop
in the two-dimensional coset nls model. in this section we complete a derivation
of area law of the wilson loop in the fundamental representation.
in this section
we use the large n expansion [55, 56, 57, 58, 59] for the coset nls model, see e.g.
[28, 29, 30, 31] for reviews of large n expansion.

to perform the large n expansion, it is convenient to introduce the new variables,

pab(x)
v ab
 (x)
which are used to rewrite

:= a(x)b(x) = u1a(x) u1b(x),
:= v a

 (x)(t a)ab,

(9.1)
(9.2)

(9.3)

c(x) := na(x)v a

 (x) = pab(x)v ab
where a = 1,   , n 2  1 and a, b = 1,   n for su(n).
the wilson loop operator in powers of the coupling constant g is rewritten into

in terms of the above variables, the expansion (8.7) of the expectation value of

 (x),

the diagrams needed to calculate this expectation value are drawn in fig.9 based
on the feynmann rule given in fig.8. here it should be remarked that the denition
of the wilson loop operator

hw c[a]i :=

1

n*tr(cid:20)p exp(cid:18)igic

dxa(x)(cid:19)(cid:21)+y m4

,

(9.6)

includes the normalization factor n 1 and that the expectation value (9.6) of the
wilson loop may has a well-dened large n limit. in particular, in the zero coupling
limit, the expectation value reduces to one.

9.1 large n expansion and dimensional reduction

it is known [32] that only the planar diagrams contribute to the expectation value

haa1b1

n (xn)iy m4

(9.7)

in the leading order of the large n expansion. see fig. 9. however, it is extremely
dicult to sum up the innite number of terms belonging to the leading order of
the large n expansion and to get the closed expression in the four-dimensional case.
however, this does not exclude the possibility that the closed expression obtained by
summing up all the leading diagram may exhibit the area law. in fact, this strategy
has been carried out in the two-dimensional case and successfully has lead to the area
law, see e.g., [60].

for the planar wilson loop c, we have already shown that the parisi-sourlas di-
mensional reduction occurs and that the tqft sector reduces to the two-dimensional
coset nls model, i.e. the nls model on the ag space fn1. hence, we obtain

(f), which are furthermore classied by the order of . note that the contribution
from a nonplanar diagram (d) is suppressed in the large n. the diagram (g) is the
vacuum polarization diagram due to quarkanti-quark pair creation and annihilation

it should be remarked that the f [c] is of order o(/n). this is dierent from
the result of the usual large n expansion of the yang-mills theory, i.e., diagram (a)

[17], it was shown that the perturbative sector obeys the lorentz type gauge xing,
v = 0, by virtue of the background gauge. here we adopt the feynman gauge to
simplify the calculation. then the propagator for v a

(9.22)

note that q(x, x) is of order o(n2) and hence the f [c] is of order o(/n). this
is because we consider the large n expansion of the cp n1 model (see appendix d)

with the composite gauge eld,

under the constraint,

(x)(x) := a(x)a(x) = 1.

(9.23)

(9.24)

(9.25)

it is not dicult to show that the above estimation gives the correct order for the
higher-order terms, e.g., (b), (e) in fig. 9, by making use of the relations (4.73)

50

2(x2)v c

1(x1)v b

n(xn)ipy m4 is proportional to ig4f abc,
and (4.74). for example, g3hv a
and ig4f abctr[t at bt c]/n 3 = g4f abcf abc/(4n 3) = o(g4), since f abcf abd =
c2(adj)cd and c2(adj) = n.
another way to understand this result is based on the idea of the reduction
of degrees of freedom which are responsible to the wilson loop. the ag space
has dimension, dimfn1 = n(n  1), whereas the cp n1 has the dimension,
dimcp n1 = 2(n  1). therefore, the relevant degrees of freedom is reduced for
the fundamental quark in the large n, since dimcp n1 = 2dimfn1/n for large n.
indeed, this result is expected from the nast given by (4.54), i.e.,

w c[a] = z [d()]c exp(cid:18)igic

a(cid:19) .

(9.26)

the abelian gauge eld a = tr(ha) has only two physical degrees of freedom, while
the non-abelian gauge eld a = aat a in the wilson loop (9.6) has 2(n 2  1)
components. thus the large n expansion is reduced to the perturbative expansion
in the coupling constant g. in this sense, the large n expansion combined with the
nast justies the identication of the deformation part with the perturbative one.
then we nd that the f [c] is of order o(/n). therefore, in the leading order of

the large n expansion, the static potential and the string tension are given by

v (r) =  lim

(9.28)

now we proceed to estimate the second term, f [c]. we will show that the second
term gives at most the perimeter law so that the area law (if any) is provided by the
rst term. because of the factor  in hv a
 (y)ipy m4, only integration between
parallel sides dx and dy gives a contribution to f [c]. thus f [c] is reduced to

h[c] :=

vc(r) = 

g2

r

+ const. + o(2/n 2),

(9.36)

and the second term in h[c] corresponds to the self-energy of quark and anti-quark.
furthermore, if we take into account the order o(g4) correction, the coupling constant
begins to run and the bare coupling g in (9.36) is replaced by the running coupling
constant g = g(), see e.g. kogut [61].17 in the topologically trivial case, therefore,
the second term f [c] can not give non-vanishing string tension.

next, we consider the topologically non-trivial case. we begin to estimate (9.29)
for the circular wilson loop c with a diameter r, see fig.11. if we avoid the coinciding
case x = y, f [c] has a contribution only when x and y are opposite ends of a diameter,

17 the contribution up to o(2) in the leading order diagrams (planar diagram) in the large n
expansion leads to the dierent running coupling from that in the usual perturbative calculation in
the coupling constant g.

f [c] =

gc(x, y).

(9.37)

(9.38)

it is almost clear that the f [c] is not sucient to give non-vanishing string tension,
since gc(x, y) exhibits exponential decay for large r := |x  y|. note that pab(x)
and hc  = rs d are u(1) gauge invariant quantities, so that gc(x, y) is also u(1)
gauge invariant. in the large n expansion, we can give more precise estimate of the
second term, see appendix e.

finally, we consider the topologically nontrivial case for a rectangular wilson loop
c with side lengths r and t , see fig.10. in this case, we can not give precise estimate
of the second term, since we can not perform the integration exactly. in the leading
order of 1/n expansion, it turns out that

gc(x, y) = g(x, y) := 2(t a)ab(t a)cdhpab(x)pcd(y)icp n 1

2

,

(9.39)

and that g(x, y) decays exponentially for suciently large |x  y|, see appendix e.
note that x and y are located on the opposite sides of the rectangular wilson loop.
therefore, there exists an uniform upper bound, i.e.,

| g(x, y)|  g(r).

53

(9.40)

hence, there exists an upper bound for f [c] for suciently large wilson loop such
that t > r  1,

|f [c]| 


2n

g(r)h[c],

(9.41)

where h[c] is calculated in the same way as (9.35) by taking into account all the
contributions from parallel sides dx and dy (see fig.10). therefore the second term
f [c] can not give non-vanishing string tension in the topologically nontrivial case.

thus, within this reformulation, the area law of the non-abelian wilson loop and
the linear static potential in four-dimensional su(n) yang-mills theory is realized
in two-dimensional nls

if and only if the diagonal wilson loop d exp (ihc )ecp n 1

model exhibits the area law,

d exp(cid:18)iic

(cid:19)ecp n 1

2  d exp(cid:18)izs

k(cid:19)ecp n 1

2  exp(0t r).

(9.42)

in other words, the area law or the linear potential between the fundamental quark
and anti-quark is obtained from the topological t qf t4 piece alone, i.e.,

* exp(cid:18)iic

(cid:19)+t qf t4

=* exp(cid:18)iic

(cid:19)+cp n 1

2

 exp(0t r).

(9.43)

anyway, the derivation of the area law is reduced to the two-dimensional problem.

it should be remarked that only the total static potential,

v (r) = 0r 

g2()

4

1
r

+ const.,

(9.44)

is gauge invariant, so the linear potential piece alone is not gauge invariant. however,
in the large r limit r  , the linear potential is dominant in v (r) so that the
linear potential piece becomes substantially gauge invariant.

9.2 area law in the leading order of the large n expansion

by way of the variable u, we have found that the connection one-form  appearing
in the nast is equal to the gauge-invariant part of v . therefore the diagonal wilson
loop for cp n1 model is equal to

d exp(cid:18)iic

(cid:19)ecp n 1 = d exp(cid:18)iic

v(cid:19)ecp n 1.

(9.58)

for cp 1 model, this reduces (6.51) in the previous article [13] for g = su(2).

the expectation value d exp (ihc v )ecp n 1 is calculated in the large n expansion

based on the pioneering works [55, 56, 57] as shown in appendix d. the result agrees
with the result of campostrini and rossi [59]. in the leading order of 1/n expansion,
the wilson loop exhibits the area law for all non-self-intersecting loops,

d exp(cid:18)iic

in the propagator of the vector eld v , a massless
pole appears. hence the auxiliary vector eld v becomes a dynamical gauge eld,
giving rise to a linear conning potential between  and . on the other hand, the
lagrange multiplier eld  for the constraint (9.46) becomes massive so that it does
not contribute to the conning potential between  and . thus we completes a proof
of quark connement in four-dimensional su(n) yang-mills theory based on the wil-
son criterion in the leading order of large n expansion within our reformulation of
the yang-mills theory.

10 conclusion and discussion

we have given a new version of non-abelian stokes theorem for g = su(n) for
n  2 which reduces to the previous result [15] for su(2). this version of non-
abelian wilson loop is very helpful to see the role played by the magnetic monopole
in the calculation of the expectation value of the non-abelian wilson loop. combining
this non-abelian stokes theorem with the abelian-projected eective gauge theory
for su(n), we have explained the abelian dominance for the wilson loop in su(n)
yang-mills gauge theory. for su(n) with n  3, we must distinguish the maximal
stability group h and the residual gauge group h which is taken to be the maximal
torus group h = u(1)n1.

56

in order to show magnetic monopole dominance and area law of the wilson loop,
we have used a novel reformulation of the yang-mills theory which has been proposed
by one of the authors [13]. this reformulation is based on the identication of the
yang-mills theory with the perturbative deformation of a topological quantum eld
theory. this framework deals with the gauge action sy m and the gauge-xing ac-
tion sgf on equal footing. the gauge action is characterized from the viewpoint of
geometry of connections. on the other hand, the gauge-xing part is related to the
topological invariant (euler characteristic) determined by a global topology. there-
fore, the gauge-xing part can have a geometric meaning from a global viewpoint,
which has not been emphasized in the text books of quantum eld theory so far, see
[17] for more details.

our approach relies heavily on a specic gauge, the ma gauge. in spite of the
absence of elementary scalar eld in yang-mills theory, the ma gauge made the
existence of magnetic monopole possible. the magnetic monopole is considered as
the topological soliton composed of gauge degrees of freedom, providing the composite
scalar eld. at least in this gauge, the (parisi-sourlas) dimensional reduction occurs
due to the supersymmetry hidden in the gauge xing part in the ma gauge. by
making use of the non-abelian stokes theorem within this reformulation of the yang-
mills theory, the derivation of the area law of the non-abelian wilson loop in four-
dimensional yang-mills theory has been reduced to the two-dimensional problem of
calculating the expectation value of the abelian wilson loop in the coset g/h non-
linear sigma model. this is the main result of this article.

especially, in order to show connement of the fundamental quark in the four-
dimensional su(n) yang-mills theory in the ma gauge, we have only to consider
the two-dimensional cp n1 model. from the topological point of view, the abelian
wilson loop is equivalent to the area integral (enclosed by the wilson loop) of the
instanton density in two dimensional nls model. this implies that the calculating
the magnetic monopole contribution to the wilson loop in four-dimensional yang-
mills theory was translated into that of instanton contribution in two-dimensional
nls model, when the wilson loop is contained in the two-dimensional plane, i.e.
the wilson loop is planar. in addition, the two-dimensional instanton is considered
as a subclass of the four-dimensional yang-mills instanton, see [13]. this suggest
that the area law of the wilson loop will be derived by taking into account the
contributions of a restricted class of yang-mills instantons. a monte carlo simulation
on a lattice will be ecient in order to conrm this dimensionally reduced picture of
quark connement [63].

moreover, the naive instanton calculus (dilute gas approximation) in the coset
nls model leads to area law of the wilson loop of the original four-dimensional
yang-mills theory. the improvements of the dilute gas approximation is necessary
to conrm the area law based on the above picture. however, it is rather hard, as
tried more than twenty years ago [54]. an advantage of the extension of the above
strategy to su(n) with arbitrary n is that the large n systematic expansion becomes
available. the large n calculation of the wilson loop has shown the area law of the
wilson loop. these results conrm the area law of the wilson loop. it is known that
the large n yang-mills theory is related to the string theory. the correspondence

57

between the instanton calculus and the large n expansion and the related issue in the
large n expansion in yang-mills theory will also be discussed in a subsequent article
[42]. these consideration will shed more light on the conning string picture [64].

for [m, n] = [m, 0] (resp.
[0, n]),  and  run over 1, 2 (resp. 2, 3). then the
corresponding coherent state parametrizes cp 2. from orthogonality of the states
which span the representation space, the terms contributing to n in (a.1) must
satisfy the condition,

only to estimate the following terms,

a.2 su (n ) coherent state
in su(n), the simple root i and dynkin index [m1,   mn1] are dened by (3.47)
and i   := mi/2. in general, the roots e belonging to the coset group g/ h are
nonorthogonal to the highest weight 18. we will restrict the case of [m, 0,   , 0],
namely, only 1 is nonorthogonal to . any positive root  is given by the linear
combination of simple roots i. the positive roots i in (a.1) are nonorthogonal
to , so they must include 1.
:=

1 +    + i (i = 1,   n  1) , which are realized by (e i)kl = 1,ki+1,l/2 in n
representation. the corresponding coherent state parametrizes cp n1. we can easily
extend the cp 2 case to cp n1 from the fact that [e i, e j ] = 0 and i  ~ = m/2.
(this situation is same as su(3) case, i.e., [e1, e2] = 0, (1)  ~ = (2)  ~ = m/2.)

(0 : b1 : b2) denes a point in cp 2  u1, i.e., the map

(0 : 2 : 3)  cp 2  u1  (2 : 3)  cp 1

(b.10)

is the one-to-one and onto mapping. then we can identify cp 2  u1 with cp 1,
cp 2  u1 = cp 1.
on the other hand, the identication of u1 and c2, i.e., u1 = c2 by the mapping
1 leads to

(b.11)
using cp 1 = c1 {(0 : 1)}, we can write cp 2 = c2  c1 {(0 : 1)}  c2  c1  c0.
cp 2  u1 is called the line at innity and is denoted by , i.e., cp 2  u1 = . so
we can also write

the integral in (d.13) is ultraviolet divergent. it can be regularized by introducing

the dynamically generated gauge eld a produces long-range force with the linear
potential which connes the s. both global su(n) and local u(1) symmetries can
not be broken in two dimensions due to coleman theorem.
in dimensions d > 2
[69], there is a critical point gc such that for g < gc su(n) and u(1) symmetries
are broken, hai 6= 0, while hi = 0.
in this phase  is regarded as the nambu-
goldstone particle, since m = 0. the massless vector pole exists in the propagator
ha(x)a(0)i [70]. for g > gc, on the other hand, su(n) and u(1) symmetries are
exact, hai = 0, and hi 6= 0. in this phase  is massive, m = hi. for d = 2,
gc = 0. for more details on the large n results, see [65, 66, 67, 68].
