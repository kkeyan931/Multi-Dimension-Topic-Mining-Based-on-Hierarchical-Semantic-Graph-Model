1 introduction

boundary state formalism, which is a powerful tool for describing the branes and their

interactions, has been successfully applied to a number of problems, for example d-branes

dynamics in dierent congurations and spacetime dimensions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. on the

other hand, back-ground elds b and a (a u(1) gauge eld which lives in brane) can
be introduced to the string -model action, to obtain mixed boundary condition (i.e. a

combination of dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions) for string [8]. previously we

obtained the mixed boundary state for a static mixed brane (i.e. a brane in above back-

ground elds), and interaction of static mixed branes in spacetime in which some of its

dimensions are compactied on tori [8]. we saw that the states emitted from the branes,

which are wrapped around compact directions with internal back-ground elds turn out to

be dominant along a certain direction. their windings around the compact directions of

brane are also correlated with their momenta along the brane.

in addition to the above considerations (i.e. existence of the back-ground elds and

compactication of spacetime), now we consider the motion of the mixed branes. we will

see that the momentum component of the closed string state along the motion of the brane,

is also correlated with its windings around the compact directions of the brane. also back-

ground elds, compactication and velocities all together, cause the interaction amplitude
take an interesting form. for example when these three exist, the initial position yi0 of the

brane along the motion appears in the interaction.

in section 2 we obtain the boundary states for moving mixed branes in compact space-

time. in section 3 we use of these boundary states to calculate interaction of two branes
of dimensions p1 and p2 with dierent internal elds f1 and f2, moving with velocities v1
and v2. we shall also show that these results reduce to the known cases of the d-branes
in non-compact spacetime. to elucidate our general computations, we apply our results to
special cases: parallel m1  m1 and perpendicular m1  m1 systems. finally contribution
of the massless states on the interaction will be obtained.

in this article a brane in back-ground internal elds, is denoted by mp-brane, which
is a mixed brane with dimension p. since compactication eects on the interaction of

the moving mixed branes do not depend on the fermions , we will consider only the bosonic

string.

2 moving mixed brane and boundary state

we begin with a -model action containing b eld and two boundary terms corresponding
to the two mp1 and mp2-branes gauge elds [9], and their velocities [4, 10]

variation of this action with respect to x (,  ) gives the equation of motion of x (,  ) and

these denitions of the matrices m and n imply s be an orthogonal matrix, i.e. mm t =

from now on, we restrict ourselves to the case that mp1 and mp2 -branes move along the

therefore, for the closed string state emitted from the moving brane with back-ground elds

in compact spacetime, besides, that the momentum components along the world volume of

the brane are non-zero and are quantized, the momentum component along the motion of

the brane is also non-zero and is quantized. more details of (22-24) for v2 = 0, can be found
in [8]. in (20), due to the relations (22-24), the summation over the momentum components
can be changed to a sum over winding numbers, {n 2c}.

3 moving mixed branes interaction

before calculation of the interaction amplitude, let us introduce some notations for the
positions of these two mixed branes. the set {i} shows the directions perpendicular to
the both of the branes, in which i0 is not in {i}, the set {u} for the directions along the
both of them, in which 0 is not in {u}, the set {1} for the directions along the mp1 and
perpendicular to the mp2, and the set {2} for the directions along the mp2 and perpendicular
to the mp1-branes. it can be seen that for example

{i1} = {i}[{i0}[{2} , {1} = {1}[{u}[{0} .

(26)

the complete boundary state can be written as the product | bi =| bxi | bghi, therefore

the interaction amplitude is

a = hb1 | d | b2, 0 = 0i ,

(27)

where d is the closed string propagator. the nal result is

5 massless states contribution to the amplitude

in this part, to see how distant branes interact we obtain the interaction of these branes

due to the exchange of the massless states. as the metric, antisymmetric tensor and dilaton
states have zero winding and zero momentum numbers, only the term with n uc = 0 (for all
uc) corresponds to these three massless states. by using the identity deta = et r(lna) for a
matrix a, there is the following limit for d = 26,

6 conclusion

we explicitly showed that how total eld strength, velocity of the brane and compactication

eects appear in the boundary state. these cause the closed string state emitted from the

brane to have a quantized momentum along the brane and, along the motion of the brane.

interaction amplitude takes the general form under the inuence of total eld strengths
(f1,f2), velocities (v1, v2), dimensions (p1, p2) and compactication. in non-compact space-
time exchange of the massless states between the parallel mp-branes depends on the impact
parameter as 1/ | y |(22p).

the formalism can be extended to include type iia and type iib superstring theories.
