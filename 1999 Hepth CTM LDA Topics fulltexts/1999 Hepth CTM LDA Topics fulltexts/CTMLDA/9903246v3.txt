abstract

we show that, in the limit of zero string coupling, gs  0, the thermody-
namic partition function of matrix string theory is identical to that of the nite
temperature, discrete light-cone quantised (dlcq) type iia superstring. we
discuss how the superstring is recovered in the decompactied r+   limit.

1 introduction and summary

m-theory is an eleven dimensional theory whose compactication on a circle
is equivalent to ten dimensional iia superstring theory with coupling constant
gs related to the radius of the compact dimension. the higher kaluza-klein
modes corresponding to m-theory degrees of freedom with non-zero momenta
in the compact direction are the d0-branes of the iia theory. according to
the proposal of banks, fischler, shenker and susskind [1] the full dynamics of
m-theory in the innite momentum frame is described by the large n limit of
supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics with gauge group u(n). there is a
further conjecture that, at nite n , the matrix model describes discrete light-
cone quantised (dlcq) m-theory, the de-compactied limit occurring when n
and the light-cone compactication radius are taken to innity in the appropri-
ate way [2].

compactication of the matrix model on a spatial circle, to yield a descrip-
tion of iia superstring theory by a two-dimensional super-yang-mills theory,
was discussed by several authors [3, 4, 5, 6]. dijkgraaf, verlinde and verlinde
[6] gave arguments to show how iia superstrings emerge in the limit of weak

string coupling. in their scenario, strings are associated with the diagonal com-
ponents of the nn matrices which decouple from the o-diagonal components
in the gs  0 limit. the infrared dynamics of the diagonal elements are de-
scribed by an n = 8 supersymmetric sigma model with orbifold target space
(cid:0)r8(cid:1)n
/sn . on the other hand, the non-interacting rst-quantised superstring
is described in the light- cone gauge by the supersymmetric sigma model with
target space r8. the idea of ref.
[6] is that, when n is large, the quantum
states of the conformal eld theory with target space (cid:0)r8(cid:1)n
/sn are identical
to those of the second quantised superstring theory which lie in the appropri-
ately symmetrised innite direct product of hilbert spaces of conformal eld
theories each with target space r8. this idea is supported by the identication
of elliptic genera on the orbifold (m)n /sn for compact kahler manifold m
and similar objects which are expected to arise from second quantisation of a
superstring theory on m  s1, which was conjectured in [7] and proven in [8].
in this paper we shall present an alternative way of seeing how the matrix
model produces the quantum states of the string theory. we shall compare the
thermodynamic partition function of the matrix string theory in the limit gs 
0 with the thermodynamic partition function of the non-interacting discrete
light-cone quantised (dlcq) iia superstring. we shall nd that, at least in
this non-interacting limit, the two are identical. this implies that, at zero
string coupling (which means innite yang-mills coupling), the spectrum of the
matrix model is identical to the spectrum of all multi-string states of the non-
interacting discrete-light-cone quantised iia superstring theory. this identity
requires neither taking the large n limit nor the de-compactication of the
light-cone, r+  .
the natural extension of our result to the interacting theory would be to
show that the quantum states of the second quantised interacting dlcq iia
string theory with total longitudinal momentum n/r+ would be identical to the
gauge invariant eigenstates of the hamiltonian of u (n ) matrix string theory.
this is the content of the conjecture in [2]. it should be possible to check this
idea by comparison of perturbative corrections to the thermodynamic partition
functions of each model. superstring perturbation theory has been discussed in
the context of matrix string theory by several authors [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. it
is likely that some of these proposals could be studied systematically within our
approach.

the partition function of matrix string theory should be constructed by

using the hamiltonian of the appropriately compactied matrix theory,

where the notation and conventions are explained in section 3. this hamilto-
nian is to be interpreted as the light-cone hamiltonian of m-theory

h = p +

2

(2)

where m-theory has two compactied dimensions, one of them spatial, in order
that it describes the iia superstring and the other the light-cone direction x +
with radius r+. the gauge invariant states of this hamiltonian are those of
m-theory in a sector of xed longitudinal momentum

p  =

n
r+

(3)

which is discrete since momentum in a compact direction should be quantised in
units of inverse radius. to obtain the theory on un-compactied ten dimensional
space the limit r+   would eventually have to be taken.3

we use (2) and (3) to form the thermodynamic partition function,

z[] = tr(cid:16)ep 0(cid:17) = tr(cid:16)e 

2 (p ++p )(cid:17)
trn(cid:16)eh/2(cid:17)

(5)

where in (4) the trace is to be taken over all eigenstates of both p + and p 
and  = 1/kbt with kb the boltzmann constant and t the temperature. the
trace over p  leads to the summation over n in (5). taking the trace over
gauge invariant states of the d=2 super-yang-mills theory with xed n in (5)
yields an expression for the partition function in terms of a euclidean functional
integral

z[] =



xn =0z [da][dx i][d] exp(cid:16)n/2r+  se[a, x i, ](cid:17)

(6)

where the action se is the continuation to two-dimensional euclidean space
of the action from which the hamiltonian (1) can be obtained by canonical
quantisation. the two dimensional integration in se[a, x i, ] is over a torus

with spatial coordinate 1  [0, 1) and temporal coordinate in 2  [0, /2)

and the elds have periodic boundary conditions in the spatial directions, x i
and a are periodic and  are anti-periodic in euclidean time. by suitable
rescaling, the euclidean time interval can be set to [0, 1) and the temperature
would then appear in coecients in the action. details are discussed in section
3. note that, as is usually the case, the thermal boundary conditions, which are
dierent for fermi and bose degrees of freedom, break the supersymmetry of the
theory. this reects the dierent thermal populations of fermionic and bosonic
states of the matrix model (as well as the iia superstring) and is an expected
feature of a supersymmetric theory at nite temperature. for a recent discussion
of supersymmetry and other issues in matrix theory at nite temperature, see
[15, 16, 17].

3note that in the matrix model description of m-theory, n is the number of d0-branes
which are the basic building blocks of all objects. in the matrix string theory on the other
hand, because of the 9-11 ip which is used in ([6]), n labels the quantum of momentum p +.

3

we then consider this partition function in the limit gs  0. in that limit, it
reduces to a model where the degrees of freedom are the diagonal elements of the
matrix-valued elds. the gauge elds decouple and the scalar and fermion elds
form a super-conformal eld theory with target space the orbifold (r8)n /sn .
we shall nd that, for this model, the thermodynamic free energy, dened by

in the path integral in (7), the bose elds ~x have periodic boundary conditions

respectively.  = 1 + i2 is the usual teichmuller parameter of the torus. in

which, we shall argue in section 2, is the appropriate constraint for the dlcq
superstring. the other teichmuller parameter 2 arises from the summation

over eigenvalues of p +. on the other hand, in the matrix string theory, these
parameters originate from the sum over permutations which occur in the bound-
ary conditions of the diagonal components of the matrices when they are the
variables of the orbifold sigma model. similar permutations have been argued
to play a key role in the computation of the witten index [18, 19, 20, 21] and in
yang-mills theory partition functions on tori [22, 23]. they are also important
in obtaining the spectrum of two dimensional yang-mills theory from the path
integral [24, 25] and in the correspondence between two dimensional yang-mills
theory and a random surface model [26, 27, 28].

since the thermodynamic partition function encodes information about the
energy levels and degeneracies of states, we conclude that the spectrum of the
gs  0 limit of matrix string theory is identical to the spectrum of the second-
quantised non-interacting dlcq iia superstring.
it is interesting to study how the expression (7) will recover the superstring
partition function in the limit r+  . the mechanism by which this occurs
is clear. the only suppression of the magnitude of n in the summation in (7)
comes from the exponential which has r+ in the denominator. when r+ >> ,
the sum is dominated by very large n . when n becomes very large,  in (9)
should become a continuous variable.  should correctly be dened as varying
as the integers s and n/r vary. then, when n is very large, the increments in
 as we go between successive values of s and n/r are small and the summation
over s, n and r become integrations over 1 and 2 and a summation over r. in
fact, 1 is varied by changing s while holding r and n/r xed, so that

d1 =

in section 2 we will review the derivation of the nite temperature partition
function of the superstring. we use the relativistic particle and the bosonic
string to illustrate the main idea in a simpler context and to derive some nec-
essary formulae. then we derive an expression for the free energy of the type
iia superstring using discrete light-cone quantisation, as well as the partition
function of the superstring.

in section 3 we discuss the thermodynamic partition function for the matrix
string model. we argue that taking the gs  0 limit reduces the model to
one for the diagonal components of the matrices with boundary conditions that
are (anti-)periodic up to permutations of the eigenvalues in both the space and
compact euclidean time directions. we then show how the combinatorics of
permutations reduces to a sum over coverings of the torus, which produces a
sum over the teichmuller parameters in (7).

use the convention for the minkowski metric

where ~x is the vector made from the d  1 spatial components of x, the light-

2 thermodynamic free energy of the discrete

light-cone quantised superstring

in this section, we will derive the thermodynamic free energy of the dlcq iia
superstring. to illustrate the point, we begin with a review of the relativistic
particle and the bosonic string. then we discuss the dlcq bosonic string
at nite temperature. finally, we derive the partition function of the dlcq
superstring.

2.1 relativistic particle

to begin, we consider the free energy per unit volume of a relativistic particle,
in d spacetime dimensions

f
v

= (1)f 1
 z

dd1p

(2)d1 ln(cid:16)1  (1)f e(~p)(cid:17)

(24)

f = 0 if the particle is a boson and f = 1 for a fermion. the energy is

(~p) =p~p2 + m 2 with m the mass.

to write the integral (24) in terms of light-cone momenta we use the identity

(p0  (~p)) = 2p0(p0)(p2  m 2)

= 2(cid:0)p+ + p(cid:1) (p+ + p)(2p+p  ~p 2

+p(cid:17)! (27)

here, in order to equate the two terms which arise from (26), we have made use
of a symmetry of the integrand under an interchange of p+ and p.

we then use a taylor expansion of the logarithm to present the free energy

per unit volume as

in this form, the free energy is a trace over the space of states of a density

matrix which is made from the light-cone hamiltonian,

hl.c. =

and which can be thought of as the trace of the light-cone time evolution op-
erator over intervals of euclidean time n/2. the volume is v = lvt with
vt and l the volume of the transverse space and length of the longitudinal
direction, respectively.

the gaussian integral over ~pt in (28) can be done explicitly to get

2p

+ p(cid:19)(cid:21) (31)

finally, let us take note of the modication of the formula (31) which would
be necessary in dlcq. the light-cone direction x + is assumed to be compact-
ied, so that we should identify x + and x + + 2r+. this identication gives
the momentum conjugate to x +, i.e. p  a discrete spectrum. thus, rather
than the integral over p in (31) we should have a sum over the spectrum

p = k/r+

(32)
this formula will be used to derive the path integral expression for the free
energy of the dlcq closed string. an expression similar to it was quoted in ref
[34].

2.2 dlcq bosonic closed string

the equations of motion and constraints of the bosonic closed string theory are

+x  = 0
+x +x = 0
x x = 0

(33)
(34)

(35)

x + is identied with x + + 2r+. in closed string theory, boundary conditions
are periodic,

x (,  + 2) = x (, ) + 

+2r+r

(36)

where r is an integer which is the number of times the string world-sheet wraps
the compact direction x +.

9

the equations of motion have the light-cone gauge solution

x(, ) = x + p 
x +(, ) = x+ + p + + rr+ + (oscillators)
~xt (, ) = ~xt + ~pt  + (oscillators)

(37)

since the canonical commutation relations are

and x+ is a compact variable, the momentum p  is quantised as

(cid:2)x+, p (cid:3) = i

p  =

k
r+

in this light-cone gauge, the virasoro constraints can be solved to eliminate
the light-cone components of the oscillators, +
n6=0. the remaining
constraint which must be imposed is

n6=0 and +

l0 = 0 = l0

the sum of these gives the mass-shell condition,

0 = l0 + l0  p p = m 2 =

and their dierence gives the condition

2

 (cid:16)h + h  2(cid:17)

0 = l0  l0  p   (rr+) = kr = h  h

where, the hamiltonians are

h =



x1

~m  ~m

and

h =



x1

~m  ~m

the right- and left-moving light-cone gauge oscillators have the algebra

m, j

n(cid:3) = mm+nij
n(cid:3) = mm+nij

where i, j = 1, ..., 24. (for the bosonic string, we x the spacetime dimension
to be d=26.)

now, we can examine the free energy of the bosonic string. at the one loop
level, it is gotten by computing the sum of free energies of the particles in the
string spectrum. this is obtained from (32) with f = 0, using the fact that for

10

the string m 2 are the eigenvalues of the operator given in (38) which also obey
the constraint (39). the constraint can be enforced by a discrete sum,

later, we shall see that these parameters become the teichmuller parameters of
the worldsheet of the string which is a torus. we see that, for the dlcq string,
they take discrete values, which should merge to form a continuum of tori when
the limit r+   is taken. in terms of these parameters, the free energy of
the bosonic string is

this is the free energy density of the dlcq bosonic string.
it is similar to
the known free energy except that, rather than an integration over the te-
ichmuller parameters of the torus with the appropriate gauge xed measure of
the polyakov path integral, there is a discrete summation with values of  (n, k, s)
given in (46).

11

of course, it should recover the well known expression [33] for the partition
function of the bosonic closed string when the light-cone is de-compactied,
i.e. in the limit r+  . one can see from equation (45) that, in this limit,
the sum is dominated by combinations of integers where nk is very large. the
correct continuum limit is gotten by considering integration over all values of
2 as the limit of doing the sum over the integers k while holding n and s xed.

2.3 dlcq iia superstring

let us now consider the case of a closed type ii superstring in ten dimensions.
the superstring theory contains equal numbers of space-time bosons and space-
time fermions which are treated dierently in the formula (32). we can get
the superstring partition function by using the average of the two contributions
f = 0 and f = 1 in (32) and then summing over the total multiplicities of all
allowed states of the superstring theory, weighted by the appropriate boltzmann
factor. this technique was originally used in [30]. the free energy is

that the oscillators numbers obey

(58)

the free energy for the superstring is obtained by introducing in (55) the trace
over the string spectrum (56) and implementing the constraint (58) with a
discrete fourier sum. we use the formula for the trace over number operators

tr he22(hb+hf+hb+hf)+2i1(hb+hfhbhf)i = 28

where the teichmuller parameters are integrated over the region f , which is the
fundamental domain of the torus. in this expression the sum over m and n is
the sum over maps of the torus in which the space and time time coordinates,
respectively, of the torus wrap the target space s1 m and n times. one can use
modular transformations to characterise these wrappings by a single integer. in

doing so, the integration domain for the teichmuller parameters is expanded
from f to the region s, 1/2 < 1 < 1/2, 0 < 2 < .

3 the thermodynamic partition function of ma-

trix string theory

3.1 matrix string hamiltonian

in this section we derive the matrix string hamiltonian starting from the matrix
theory formalism [1]. in particular we wish to identify the dependence on the
string coupling constant gs, on the string tension . the starting point is the
matrix theory hamiltonian, which describes a stack of n d0-branes. in terms
of the ten dimensional superstring string tension [36] it has the form

h =

where a = 1, . . . , 9. each of the adjoint scalar matrices x a is a hermitian
n  n matrix, where n is the number of 0-branes. the super-partners of
the x elds are the 16 component spinors  which transform under the so(9)
cliord algebra given by the 1616 matrices a. conventionally mtheory is
related to type-iia string theory via the compactication of the 11-th direction,
which relates the coupling constant g to the compactication radius of the 11-
th dimension r11 through g = r11. the hamiltonian (72) can also be
expressed in eleven dimensional planck units, by replacing g = r11 and
 = l2

the mass-dimensions of h and of the elds are

[h] = m ,

,

we now compactify the 9th dimension on a circle of radius r9. after the usual
t -duality, we can identify x 9 with the covariant derivative

x 9  ir9d1 = ir9(


1  ia1)

where the coordinate 1  [0, 1]. the momentum conjugate to x 9 will be
identied with the electric eld e via e = r99. this procedure [36] gives the
hamiltonian (where i = 1, . . . , 8 now labels the transverse coordinates)

constant gs in terms of r9 and lp
r9 = gs

lp = g1/3

note that the mass-dimension of gs is 0. with this substitution we obtain the

here, r11 is the radius of the dimension that must be compactied in order to
obtain the matrix description of m-theory - in its original form the matrix model

16

describes m-theory in a reference frame which has innite momentum in the
11th direction. in the more sophisticated proposal of ref. [2], this compactied
direction is the light-cone direction r+.
it was shown by seiberg [37] that,
with certain assumptions, a boost to the frame with innite momentum of a
theory compactied on a small circle r11 is equivalent to one with the light
cone compactied. for a more recent discussion of these issues see [38, 39, 40].
here, anticipating that we are actually describing dlcq m-theory, we shall
make the replacement

r11  r+

the hypothesis is that this model describes dlcq m-theory with one dimension
compactied (to describe the dlcq iia superstring). the canonical momenta
which appear in (76) are normalised so that they have the conventional canonical
commutators,

3.2 matrix string free energy

using the hamiltonian (76) we shall now construct the thermal partition func-
tion z of the matrix string theory in the limit gs  0. the prescription discussed
in the previous sections for the treatment of the thermal ensemble for systems
in the light-cone frame, and the fact that p = n/r+ lead us to write z as



z = trep0

trneh/2o (78)
exp(h/2) is to be taken over gauge invariant states of the two-dimensional

and the covariant derivative is d =   i[a, ...]. here, we have rescaled the
time 2 so that the integration is over a box of area one, 0   < 1, and 
appears as a factor in various coupling constants. boundary conditions in the
path integral are

a(1 + 1, 2) = a(1, 2)
x i(1 + 1, 2) = x i(1, 2)
(1 + 1, 2) = (1, 2)

a(1, 2 + 1) = a(1, 2)
x i(1, 2 + 1) = x i(1, 2)
(1, 2 + 1) = (1, 2)

(81)

the anti-periodicity of the fermion eld in the euclidean time comes from taking
the trace in (78).

the limit gs  0 of this theory was formulated by dvv [6]. in this limit,
the eld congurations which have nite action are related to diagonal eld
congurations by

x i() = u ()x i
d()u1()
() = u ()d()u1()

a() = iu ()(cid:0)  iad

 ()(cid:1) u1()

(82)

d, d and ad

where x i
 are diagonal matrices. the elds x i,  and a have
the (anti-)periodic boundary conditions (81). this implies that the diagonal
matrices have boundary conditions which are periodic up to permutations (and
gauge transformations generated by the cartan sub-algebra),

 )a(1 + 1, 2) = (ad
d)a(1 + 1, 2) = (x i

(ad
 )p (a)(1, 2) + 2(n)a + a

(d)a(1, 2 + 1) = (d)q(a)(1, 2)

 )a(1, 2 + 1) = (ad
d)a(1, 2 + 1) = (x i

(83)

where a = 1, ..., n , p (a) and q(a) are permutations and n, m are integers.
consistency requires that the two permutations commute,

p q = qp

(84)

to compute the partition function, in the gs  0 limit, we should now do the
path integral (79) over only the diagonal components of the matrix elds with
the action

and with the boundary conditions (83). we should then sum over topologically
distinct congurations, characterised by the permutations p and q and by the
integers m, n. we shall not discuss the validity of the assumptions leading to
this starting point in the present paper (see discussions in [9, 10]).

the partition function that we must compute thus decomposes into topo-

logical sectors as

z =



xn =0

1
n !

en /2r+xp,q

z(p, q) ,

(86)

(where we have suppressed the dependence on the integers in the boundary
conditions for gauge elds). here, for each n we have divided by contribution
by the volume of the weyl group, n !, which reects the fact that the eigenvalues
are dened up to a global permutation.
(from the m-theory point of view,
this factor gives boltzmann statistics to the d0-branes.) the possibility of
introducing dierent weights in the sum over pairs of commuting permutation
has been discussed in [22]. we shall show in what follows that the correct
partition function for the type iia string emerges from (86) only when all of
the pairs (p, q) have the same weight.

3.2.1 gauge elds are irrelevant

we rst observe that, in all cases, when gs  0 the gauge elds are irrelevant.
consider for the moment the qed partition function
zu(1) =z [da1][da2] exp(cid:20)z 1

where gauge elds are periodic up to integers and gauge transforms,

a(1, 2 + 1) = a(1, 2) + 2m + a ,
a(1 + 1, 2) = a(1, 2) + 2n + a .

(88)

the nth power of this partition function would arise as the gauge eld contri-
bution to the full partition function in the topological sector where p and q
are the trivial permutation. (for a non-trivial permutation, though the details
would be slightly dierent, the arguments below would still hold.)

we can un-twist this boundary conditions with a non-periodic gauge trans-
formation to present the gauge eld in terms of a periodic gauge eld a ac-
cording to

a(1, 2) = a(1, 2) + 2n12


(89)

the partition function becomes

in the gs  0 limit only the n2 = 0 sector survives and, for consistency with
the approximations made above, the contribution of the yang mills term to the
thermal partition function of the matrix string theory, should just be set to 1.

3.2.2 generalities about permutations

a discussion on the permutations of n elements commuting with a given per-
mutation p has been given in [22, 21]. it is useful at this point to review some
of the salient points, for which we follow the appendix of [22].

consider a xed permutation p of a set of n elements. it can be decomposed
into cycles which are subsets of the n elements such that the permutation
interchanges elements cyclically inside each subset. for example, for n = 9, the
permutation which can be denoted by

 =(cid:18) 1

6

2 3
4 1

4 5
2 5

6 7
3 8

8 9

9 7(cid:19)

has the three cycles (1) = 6, (6) = 3, (3) = 1 and (7) = 8, (8(= 9,
(9) = 7, the two-cycle (2) = 4, (4) = 2 and the one-cycle (5) = 5. thus it
can be decomposed into the product of disjoint cycles

 = (163)(24)(5)(789)

consider such a decomposition of p . suppose that the number of cycles of

the maximum is n . (in the above example, r1 = 1, r2 = 1, r3 = 2.)

length k is rk, so that n =pk krk. clearly, the minimum value of k is one and
denote the elements of the set {1, 2, ..., n} by the three index notation based

on how they transform under p :

ak,
n

(k = 1, ..., n ); ( = 1, ..., rk) : (n = 1, ..., k)

(93)

of p . eq. (94) implies that

since p q = qp , this equation can be written as

q(cid:0)p (cid:0)ak,

this means that

p(cid:0)q(cid:0)ak,
(cid:16)q(cid:16)ak,
1 (cid:17) , , ..., q(cid:16)ak,

(cid:16)q(cid:16)ak,

is a cycle of length k in p , i.e. that

, ..., ak,k()

s+k1 mod k(cid:17)

hence, there exists a permutation k() of the rk elements of the set of cycles
of length k which is induced by q. clearly, q commutes with p .

any such permutation of the cycles of length k for each k corresponds to an
acceptable element of q. for each of these permutations, there is an additional
piece of information - the ordering of a cycle is cyclic, so the permutation be-
tween two cycles of length k can also involve an element of the cyclic group (or,
alternatively, the rst element of the cycle  can be mapped onto any element of
the cycle k()). this implies that there exist rk integers, s(k, )  {1, 2, .., k}
(with   1, 2, ..., rk) such that
q(cid:0)ak,

n (cid:1) = ak,k()

thus, a permutation q which commutes with p is completely determined

n+s(k,) mod k

(97)

by assigning for each value of k,

 a permutation k  sk ( where the permutation group acting on the rk

cycles of order k in p )

 a set of rk integers s(k, )  {1, 2, ..., k)

the permutation q is then dened by (97).

it follows that the number of permutations q which commute with a given

permutation p is

(98)

rk!krk .

3.2.3 how permutations determine the world-sheet metric

consider a set of diagonal components of elds obeying the boundary conditions

a(1 + 1, 2) = p (a)(1, 2) ,
a(1, 2 + 1) = (1)f q(a)(1, 2) .

(99)

where f = 0 for a bose eld and f = 1 for a fermion. consider those which
occur in the cycles of length k of p

ak

(1 + 1, 2) = ak
akn (1, 2 + 1) = (1)f ak()

n+s

n+1

n

(1, 2) ,
(1, 2) .

(100)

for each xed , we fuse these elds together into a single function which has
the property

ak(1 + k, 2) = ak (1, 2) ,
ak (1, 2 + 1) = (1)f ak() (1 + s(k, ), 2) .

(101)

then, we consider a cycle of the permutation q, which must be a subset of the
rk k-cycles of p . say this cycle is of length r where 1  r  rk. then we fuse
r of the above elds together to get the single eld which has (anti-)periodic
boundary conditions

ak,r (1 + k, 2) = ak,r (1, 2) ,
ak,r (1, 2 + r) = (1)f rak,r (1 + s, 2) .

(102)

where s =p s(k, ) mod k is the accumulated shift for the r elements in the

the space on which coordinates which are arguments of the eld in (102)
take values is the torus depicted in g. 1. the contribution to the path integral
of this set of elds is denoted by

the bose elds are

(104)

and for the fermi elds are

it is possible to change the coordinates in the action (103) so that the in-

(1 + 1, 2) = (1, 2)

23

(1, 2 + 1) = (1)r(1, 2)

(110)

note that the boundary condition for the fermi eld still depends on r.

when r is even, the fermion and boson have the same boundary conditions.
these sectors are supersymmetric. the mode expansion of both the fermions
and bosons contain zero modes. functional integration over bosonic zero modes
produces a factor of the innite volume of r8 and integration over the fermionic
zero mode produces a factor of zero. if we were computing the witten index,
this product of innity times zero, suitably regulated would yield the number
of zero energy states of the supersymmetric theory. however, here, we are
computing an extensive thermodynamic variable - the free energy - from which
we must extract a factor of the volume of the space in order to obtain the free
energy density. in this case, sectors which contain fermion zero modes do not
contribute.

on the other hand, when r is odd, the fermions have anti-periodic boundary
conditions - supersymmetry is broken by this boundary condition - and there
are no fermion zero modes in the mode expansion. these sectors will survive
and contribute to the partition function. thus,

z(k, r, s) = 0 when r is even

(111)

3.2.4 how the rst few orders work

we shall now construct explicitly the rst few terms contributing to the partition
function (86). the rst term is obtained by considering the trivial permutations
of the n eigenvalues in both directions. the eigenvalues are then periodic in
both directions and eq.(99) reads

i(1 + 1, 2) = i(1, 2) ,
i(1, 2 + 1) = i(1, 2) .

(112)

the transverse partition function will then be given by the product of n parti-
tion function dened on the square torus of side 1.

z (1) =

1
n !



xn =0

e n 

2r+ [z(1, 1, 0)]n .

(113)

the second order contribution to (86) is provided by summing on all the
permutation that permute any two eigenvalues, and leave unchanged the other
n  2. we denote 1(1, 2) and 2(1, 2) the two permuted eigenvalues.
there are of course 4 pairs of permutations (p, q) of two eigenvalues and all
commuting. the contribution of the trivial permutations in both direction is
already taken into account in z (1), this would give in fact a disconnected pair
of permutations.

if p = (1, 2) and q = (1)(2) the boundary conditions (99) are

i(1 + 2, 2) = i(1, 2) ,

24

i(1, 2 + 1) = i(1, 2)

(114)

for i = 1, 2, and as in (112) for the other n  2 eigenvalues. thus this pair of
commuting permutation gives a contribution [z(1, 1, 0)]n2  z(1, 2, 0). analo-
gously p = (1)(2) and q = (1, 2) give the boundary conditions

i(1 + 1, 2) = i(1, 2) ,
i(1, 2 + 2) = i(1, 2)

(115)

for i = 1, 2 with a contribution to zt given by [z(1, 1, 0)]n2  z(2, 1, 0). for
p = (1, 2) q = (1, 2) we have

i(1 + 2, 2) = i(1, 2) ,
i(1, 2 + 1) = i(1 + 1, 2)

(116)

so that r = 1, k = 2 and s = 1. by considering that there are (cid:18) n

that is necessary to have at least n = 2 to have a permutation of two eigenvalues,
the second order contribution to the partition function is thus given by

2 (cid:19) pairs and

z (2) =



xn =2

n !(cid:18) n

2 (cid:19) e n 

2r+ [z(1, 1, 0)]n2 [z(2, 1, 0) + z(1, 2, 0) + z(1, 2, 1)]

(117)

this term can be easily rearranged by shifting n  n + 2 as

z (2) =

1
n !

, s) ,

(118)

wherepr|n means the sum over the divisors of n. in an analogous way one can

construct the third order contribution to the partition function zt , this can be
obtained by considering the pairs of connected commuting permutations of three
eigenvalues. taking the trivial permutation p = (1)(2)(3) in the 1 direction,
the two permutations q = (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2) in the 2 direction each one forms
a connected commuting pair with p . any other permutation q commute with
p = (1)(2)(3) but the pair (p, q) would be in this case a disconnected pair
whose contribution to the partition function is already contained in the rst
two term of the expansion. it can be easily seen that the values of r, k and s
corresponding to the two pairs (p = (1)(2)(3), q = (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2)) are equal
and given by r = 3, k = 1, s = 0. the other pairs of connected commuting
permutations can be easily constructed to give table 1.

as can be seen from table 1 there are 4 groups of 2 pairs of (p, q) with the
same values of (r, k, s), to which correspond the same integration region in the
action in (103) or the same metric in (107).

there are(cid:18) n

3 (cid:19) choices for three eigenvalues and is necessary to have at least

n = 3 to have a permutation of three eigenvalues, the third order contribution

let us compute now the fourth order. we should consider at this order
both the pair of commuting connected permutations of four eigenvalues and the
permutations of two pairs of two eigenvalues. following the procedure illustrated
above, for the commuting connected permutations of four eigenvalues we can
construct the table 2.

as can be seen from table 2 there are 7 groups of 6 pairs of (p, q) with
the same values of (r, k, s), to which correspond the same integration region
in the action in (103) or the same metric in (107). taking into account that

there are (cid:18) n
pairs of pairs of
eigenvalues, after the shift n  4 the fourth order contribution to the partition
function reads

where z(r, k, s) is given in eq.(103). note that r gives the height of the torus, in
the 2 direction and, taking into account eqn. (111) and the discussion before
it, r must be odd.

with appropriate re-labeling of the integers, and evaluating the functional
integral (103), this is identical to (60), the expression for the free energy of the
dlcq type ii superstring. note that, in comparing this with (60), rather than
1/k2 appearing in the summand in (123), there is 1/n = 1/kr where we label
k = n/r. this dierence of a factor of k/r is absorbed in a factor of 1/2 in
(60).

4 speculations

we must caution the reader that one must be careful in interpreting thermody-
namic quantities in a theory such as string theory which intrinsically contains
gravity. because of gravitational eects, one would not expect an exact, equilib-
rium thermal ensemble to exist. however, to the extent that, at the basic level,
both superstring theory and m-theory have some degree of space-time symme-
try such as time translation invariance, it is sensible to consider the energy of

28

quantum states and the thermodynamic partition function which we consider
simply as a spectral function which encodes the energies and degeneracies of
stationary quantum states.

one interesting feature of string theory is the existence of a limiting tempera-
ture [42], which could be interpreted as evidence of a phase transition [29, 43, 44].
m-theory should also contain this feature. relevant to understanding it in m-
theory is to consider the hagedorn transition in the discrete light cone quan-
tisation of the superstring, that is, in the strongly coupled matrix model. the
relevant partition function is (60) which re-display below:

the region of summation with small values of 2 are important in the summand
which behaves as

1
nk



exp(n22/42) exp(2/2)
1
nk

exp(nk2/2r+) exp(422k/nr+)

the summation over k diverges at th = 1/kb82, the hagedorn tempera-
ture, independent of the compactication radius r+. since k (see g.1) is the
spatial length of the string, this means that near the hagedorn temperature,
the partition sum is dominated by very long strings.

as was mentioned in the introductory section, the approach that we have
followed in this paper could be generalized to an expansion of the partition
function in powers of the string coupling constant, gs. what would have to be
shown is that the order gg
s correction to the free energy is given by a summation
over worldsheets with genus g. this singular perturbation theory is similar
to that encountered in the localization formulae for path integrals describing
integrable models [45]. development of this perturbation theory could well
shed light on some aspects of the correspondence between gauge theory and m -
theory supergravity contained in the maldacena conjecture (for recent reviews
see [46, 47]).
