abstract

in the microcanonical ensemble for string theory on adsm  sn, there is a
phase transition between a black hole solution extended over the sn and a
solution localized on the sn if the adsm has the topology r2  sm2. the
phase transition will not appear if the adsm has the topology r2  t m2,
that is, when the adsm  sn geometry is regarded as arising from the near-
horizon limit of a black m  2 brane. in this paper, we argue that when the
black branes are rotating, the localization phase transition will occur between
some rotating branes and corresponding kerr black holes when the angular
momentum reaches its critical value.

the maldacenas conjecture [1] asserts that string/m theory on anti-de sitter (ads)
space (times a compact space) is dual to certain large n conformal eld theory living on
the boundary of the ads (for a recent review see [2]). thus some questions concerning large
n gauge theories may be answered via supergravity. indeed, one can use this duality to
calculate the correlation functions of gauge theory [3,4], and to study thermodynamics and
phase structure of the strong coupling gauge theory [513].

recently, banks, douglas, horowitz and martinec [14] argued that in the microcanonical
ensemble for string theory on adsm  sn, there is a phase transition between a black hole
solution extended on the sn and a solution localized on the sn, which is associated with the
gregory-laamme instability (localization instability) of black strings and p-branes [15].
this phase transition arises as follows.
it was shown by hawking and page [16], that a
large mass schwarzschild black hole in ads space has positive heat capacity, while a small
mass black hole has negative heat capacity. this implies that in the canonical ensemble the
small mass black hole is unstable. however, in the microcanonical ensemble this instability
is absent. instead the system enters into a new phase, in which the black hole localizes on
the sphere sn, because the schwarzschild black hole in m + n dimensions has larger entropy
than the equal mass schwarzschild-ads black hole. thus, at higher energies, the typical
state is a schwarzschild-ads black hole with a constant radius sphere sn; at lower energies,
where the horizon radius is smaller than the cosmological scale, the typical state becomes
a schwarzschild black hole in m + n dimensions. that is, the black hole is localized on the
sphere sn.

more recently, peet and ross [17] found that there is a subtlety in the above localization
phase transition. they showed that the existence of the phase transition crucially depends
on the spatial boundary condition (topology) of the adsm space. the above transition
may happen when the adsm has topology r2  sm2.
if one thinks of the adsm  sn
geometry as arising from the near-horizon limit of some m  2 brane, the adsm space has
topology r2t m2 or its large volume limit r2rm2. in this case. this localization phase
transition will not occur: at lower energies, the state is still the schwarzschild-ads black
hole. this is associated with the fact that in contrast to the usual schwarzschild-ads black
hole, the so-called topological black holes in ads space always have positive heat capacity
[18]. this implies that this localization instability does not appear as well for other higher
genus topological manifold m2

such that the adsm has topology r2  m2

as is well known, the near-horizon geometries of the d3-brane, d1-d5-brane, m2-brane
and m5-brane typically have structures ads5s5, ads3s3, ads4s7 and ads7s4, and
the adsm has the topology r2 t m2. therefore, the localization phase transition does not
take place on these branes. in the present paper, we are going to consider minor extension
of them, that is, rotating d3-branes, m5-branes and m2-branes. in [19] gubser showed that
the low energy excitation of the rotating black d3-branes is thermodynamically stable up
to a critical angular momentum density and a eld theory model can correctly predict this
critical limit. in a previous paper, in the canonical ensemble and grand canonical ensemble
we investigated this critical behavior in the rotating d3-branes, m2-branes and m5-branes
and found that the their heat capacity will become negative when the angular momentum
exceeds a certain critical value [20]. this leads us to suspect that in the microcanonical
ensemble the above localization phase transition may occur in the rotating branes. indeed,
as we will show shortly, at the low energy, but large angular momentum regime, a typical

state should be a kerr black hole, which has a larger entropy than the corresponding rotating
black brane.

let us begin our discussion with the rotating black d3-brane in the type iib supergravity.
the rotating black d3-brane solution has been given in [2124]. in general, the black d3-
brane solution may have three angular momentum parameters. for our purpose, however,
it is sucient to consider that only a single angular momentum parameter does not vanish.
in this case, the metric is

the extremal limit of the solution is approached by letting m  0. an interesting point
of the solution is that the extremal limit of the solution (1) can be interpreted as some
superposition of n static d3-branes, rather than that of n coinciding rotating d3-branes
[22,25]. the near-horizon limit of static d3-branes has the geometry ads5  s5 with same
radii b2
s(4gsn)1/2 for the ads5 and s5, where ls and gs are string length and coupling
constant, respectively. for the rotating d3-brane solution (1), the geometry ads5  s5 is
twisted because of the rotation. near the extremal limit, some thermodynamic quantities
of the black three-branes was given in [20]:

3 = l2

e = 332ml3,
j = 7/43/2n 1/2m1/2ll3,
 = 5/41/2n 1/2m1/2lr2

t = 211/41/2n 1/2m1/2(2r3
s = 211/43/2n 1/2m1/2r+l3.

here e denotes the energy above the extremality which equals the adm mass of the black
three-brane minus the mass of the corresponding extremal one; l3 is the spatial volume of
the world volume; 22 = (2)7g2
s; n is the number of the coincident d3-branes; and j, ,
t and s represent the angular momentum, angular velocity, hawking temperature, and the
entropy, respectively. finally, r+ is the horizon radius of the black three-branes, which is

in [20] we showed that in the grand canonical ensemble the heat capacity becomes negative
when l4/m > 8/3, which indicates there is a critical point at l4/m = 8/3. in the canonical
ensemble there is also a similar critical point. therefore the black three-brane is unstable
when the angular momentum exceeds a certain critical value. according to the maldacenas
conjecture, this also implies that there is a phase transition in the n = 4 large n super
yang-mills theory in four dimensions at nite temperature [19,20]. in the microcanonical
ensemble, where the energy e and the angular momentum j are xed, however, similar to
the case for the small mass schwarzschild-ads black hole, the above instability is absent.
instead a localization instability mentioned above will appear. that is, at low energy and
large angular momentums, that is, when the horizon radius is smaller than the cosmological
scale, the system enters into another entropically favored state, which, according to the
no-hair theorem of black holes, should be described by a kerr black hole. in addition, the
d3-branes distributed on a planar disc [22] might be an appropriate source for the kerr
solution.

a d-dimensional (d  4) kerr black hole solution with an angular momentum parameter

was given in [26]. in boyer-lindquist coordinates, its metric is

ds2 =  dt2 + sin2 (r2 + a2)d2 + (dt + a sin2 d2)2

here d2 = 2(d1)/2/[(d  1)/2] is the area of a unit (d  2)-sphere. the horizon rk of
the kerr black hole is determined by the equation grr = 0, that is,

and the entropy of the solution is one quarter horizon area,

here it seems worth pointing out that for the higher dimensional (d > 5) kerr solutions
there is no any restriction on the angular momentum in order for the solutions to have the
black hole horizon.

now let us compare the entropies of the rotating black three brane (2) and a ten-
dimensional kerr black hole (8). these two entropies can be compared extactly. for small
mass and large angular momentum, we nd

where following [17] we have rescaled the energy of excitations e as m = le/b3. from the
above we can see that these two entropies are comparable when 2m  b7
3 and 2j  b8
3.
note that in this comparison we should take m = mk and j = jk. when 2m  b7
3,
for large angular momentum 2j > b8
3, the kerr black hole has larger entropy than the
rotating d3-brane. therefore, a localization phase transition may happen when 2m  b7

and 2j  b8

transition is (cid:16) 2j

d3-branes, while the phase below the line by the kerr black hole. of course, it should be
pointed out here that there are other phases in this phase diagram, which will be discussed
at the end of the paper.

now we discuss the rotating m5-branes in the eleven-dimensional supergravity. similar to
the case of the rotating d3-brane, we also consider the case in which an angular momentum
parameter does not vanish only. the rotating m5-brane solution has been given in [27,28].
the metric can be written down as

when m = mk and j = jk, obviously, these two entropies are comparable as well if
2m  b8
5, the kerr
black hole has larger entropy than the rotating m5-branes; when keeping 2j  b9
5, and
lowering the mass such that 2m < b8
5, we can also see that the kerr black hole may have
larger entropy than the rotating m5-branes. we therefore conclude that the localization
phase transition may happen in the rotating m5-branes when 2m  b8
5 and 2j  b9
5.
that is, at low energies, beyond a critical angular momentum, the kerr black hole is the
5 (cid:17)5/3(cid:16) 2m
entropically favored phase. in this case, the critical line is (cid:16) 2j
5 (cid:17)  1. above the

line is the kerr black hole phase and the phase below the line is described by the m5-branes.
once again, there are also other phases in this phase diagram.

in this case, near the extremal limit, we have the following thermodynamic behavior of the

hole describes the phase below the line.

where b2 = lp(252n)1/6/2 is the radius of near-horizon geometry ads4 of the static m2-
branes. comparing with the entropy (14) of the eleven-dimensional kerr black hole, in this
case, when 2m  b8
2 and 2j  b9
2, we nd that these two entropies are also comparable
to one another. when 2m  b8
2, the entropy of the kerr black hole is larger than that of
the rotating m2-branes if 2j > b9
2. hence we argue that the localization phase transition
may also take place for the rotating m2-branes at 2m  b8
2. the critical line
is (cid:16) 2j
 1. in this case, above the line is the m2-brane phase and the kerr black
in summary, we have discussed the microcanonical phases on the rotating d3-, m5-,
and m2-branes, paying attention to the so-called localization instability. at low energies,
beyond a certain critical angular momentum, we have argued that the system enters into
another entropically favored phase: the phase is described by a high dimensional kerr black
hole. that is, there is a localization phase transition from some rotating black branes to
corresponding kerr black holes when the angular momentum reaches its critical value. note
that the localization transition does not occur for the static d-branes and m-branes [17].
therefore, this is completely an eect of angular momentum. here we should mention that
for the rotating d1-d5-branes, martinec and sahakian [12] have already argued the existence
of such kind of localization phase transition from ads3  s3 to a six-dimensional (6d)
black hole, which is 6d schwarzschild black hole spinning on the s3. angular momentum
is introduced in this phase by spinning up the hole along an orbit on the equator of s3

7

with momentum p  j/b, where b denotes the cosmological radius of the ads3.
it is
interesting to notice the dierence between the rotating d1-d5-brane system and the rotating
branes considered in this paper. the near-horizon limit of the rotating d1-d5-branes is
the rotating btz black hole. the latter is always thermodynamically stable and has a
restriction on the angular momentum with j  mb, beyond which the btz solution does
not represent a black hole. from [19,20], we know that the rotating d3-, m5- and m2-branes
are thermodynamically unstable for larger angular momentum and there is no any restriction
on the angular momentum in order for the branes to have a horizon. thus a non-rotating
black hole with a velocity on the sn, which has also a restriction on the angular momentum
[12], might be inappropriate to describe the new phase for these rotating branes. similar
to the schwarzschild black hole for the low energy phase of string on the adsm  sn, the
higher dimensional kerr black hole might be reasonable, as discussed in the above.
of course, there exist also other phases in the microcanonical ensemble of strings on
the rotating d-branes. for instance, as shown in [14], we expect that when the horizon
size of the kerr black hole falls into the regime of the string scale, the system goes into a
hagedorn, or long string phase, where the fundamental string dominates the entropy, this is
associated with the correspondence principle of horowitz and polchinski [29]. at the lower
energies and angular momentums, another new phase may occur, where a gas of gravitons
propagating in a rotating ads space dominate the entropy. it would be interesting to make a
detailed analysis of the microcanonical phases of string theory on the d-branes. in addition,
in this paper we have analyzed only the rotating branes with a single angular momentum
parameter. we expect that similar localization instability exists in rotating branes with
multiple angular momentum parameters, because their thermodynamics is similar [30].
