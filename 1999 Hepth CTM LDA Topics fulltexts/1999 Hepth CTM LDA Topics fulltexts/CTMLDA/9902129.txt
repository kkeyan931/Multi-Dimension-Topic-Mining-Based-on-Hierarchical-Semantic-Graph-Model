(2.21) (2.22) easy see n = 1, equations yield precisely matrix given equation (2.16). 3 on-shell usp(2) supersymmetric u(1) yang- mills theory ads5 let us start massless usp(2) supersymmetric yang-mills theory 4+1 spacetime. su(2) version theory developed zizzi {$9711200$}. u(1) theory easily obtained su(2) theory: l = 1 4 f f + 1 2 dd + 2 id/ (3.1) 4 invariant following supersymmetry transformations: = iii = iii = (f d/ )i (3.2) , = 0, . . . , 4 = 1, 2. describe theory ads5 need additional terms supersymmetry transformations nonzero mass terms scalar spinors case massless gauge potential. fact, compactication n = 2 supergravity s5 {$9711200$} ads/cft correspondence  let us determine masses: m2(a) = 0, | m() |= 1 2 , m2() = 4. (3.3) hence, u(1) yang-mills theory ads5 u(1) theory (3.1) plus mass terms: l = 1 4 f f + 1 2 dd + 2 id/ aijij 1 2 a2m22. (3.4) using proper killing spinor equation (2.12) symplectic majorana spinors, nd theory (3.4) invariant supersymmetry transformations = iii = iii = (f d/ )i 2iamijj (3.5) mij matrix given eq.

(3.7) (3.8) hence, theory contains dirac spinor mass equal 1 2 one real scalar mass equal 4. masses agree completely previous predictions given equation (3.3). 5 complete description theory need write supersymmetry algebra. using eq.

(3.16) 6 algebra contains extra term form eq.

(3.22) therefore, results, including eld masses supersymmetry algebra, remain exactly case su(n) gauge theory. 7 4 on-shell usp(2) supersymmetric conformal scalar theory ads5 theory describes 2 massless symplectic majorana fermions 4 massive real scalar elds mass 4 scalars. generalization theory developed 5-dimensional spacetime {$9711200$}. previous section, use theory develop theory ads5: l = 1 2 ii + 2 d/ 1 2 a2m2ii (4.1) = 0, . . . , 4, = 1, . . . , 4, = 1, 2. theory (4.1) invariant supersymmetry = (i)ijij = i(i)ji/ ij + 3 2(i m)ijji (4.2) = (~, i1), matrix found eq.

(5.7) nd elements scalar mass matrix: finally, putting eqs. (5.8) (5.9) together nd scalar mass matrix m2 13 = c13, m2 14 = c23, m2 34 = c12. m2 = 2 15 4 + c33 0 c13 c23 0 2 + 15 4 0 0 c13 0 2 15 4 + c11 c12 10 c23 0 c12 4 + c22 2 15 (5.9) (5.10) rows columns rearranged give block diagonal form. nd physical values masses need diagonalize m2 read physical masses diagonal. procedure yields m2 = 2 + 15 4 , 2 + 15 4 , 2 15 4 , 2 15 4 . (5.11) answer remarkable precisely masses expect ads/cft correspondence : ads/cft correspondence know theory contain complex scalar conformal dimension , complex spinor conformal dimension + 1 2, another complex scalar conformal dimension + 1, 5 dimensions gives spinor mass two scalar masses = + 1 2 2 = 3 2 m2 = ( 4) m2 = ( + 1)( 3) turn implies complex scalars theory masses equal m2 = (cid:16) + 3 m2 = (cid:16) + 5 2(cid:17)(cid:16) 5 2(cid:17)(cid:16) 3 2(cid:17) = 2 15 2(cid:17) = 2 + 15 4 4 . hence, eq. (5.10) correct scalar mass matrix equations (5.11) (5.14) exact agreement. complete study theory calculate supersymmetry algebra spinors scalars transformation rules (5.2). scalars, obtain (5.12) (5.13) (5.14) (5.15) i = 2ii 2i +ai +a 3 12ii 2(cid:16)ij mj (cid:17)ij 2(cid:16)im j j (cid:17)ij 1jj 1jj almost supersymmetry algebra conformal scalar theory, eq. (4.4), addition term proportional spinor mass, . scalar mass term (5.10) breaks so(4) symmetry so(2)so(2) (this fact becomes obvious scalar elds rotated scalar mass term becomes diagonal see discussion below), two non-derivative terms algebra must encode least part symmetry lagrangian. see clearly, let us assume 1, 2 3, 4 physical masses 2 + 15 4 respectively, pair transforms separate symmetries. first, note even symmetry breaking, transformation 4 2 15 = 2(cid:16)im j j (cid:17)ij 1jj (5.16) 11 symmetry kinetic part scalar lagrangian transformation (4.5) symmetry kinetic part well. establish fact nontrivial, boils showing j , mi hj , mi = 0 (5.17) values i, j. rewrite transformation compact form, = ii 21iqij j q 4 4 matrix q = 0 x3 x2 x1 x3 0 x1 x2 0 x3 x2 x1 x1 x2 x3 0 . (5.18) now, need understand transformation (5.15) acts mass term. see clearly, let us redene matrix dened follows: = oijj = 3 0 x3 0q1 x2 0 1 x1x31x2 x1 0 x2 0 x2x31x2 3 3 (5.19) (5.20) . 0 0 x21x2 x11x2 3 3 eld redenition, scalar mass matrix becomes diagonal precisely way discussed transformation (5.15) becomes = ii 21ii + iai 21ih3(ot o)ij + 2(ot qo)iji j (5.21) q dened eqs.
