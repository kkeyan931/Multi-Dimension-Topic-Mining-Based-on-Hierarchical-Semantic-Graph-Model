1 introduction

there has been recently some interest in higher dimensional topological eld theories.
in
particular baulieu and west studied a six dimensional topological model of two-form elds in
[1]. they also discussed the brst quantization of this model and a new kind of topological
twist operation specic to (2, 0) supersymmetry in six dimensions. the aim of this paper is to
elaborate on their work and investigate closer the brst-structure of the model and its relation
to a twist of the (2, 0) supersymmetry. more specically we are looking for a completion of
the topological supersymmetry. in [1] the authors showed that the part of the brst-operator
that encodes the topological shift symmetry can be thought of being obtained by twisting the
(2, 0) poincare supersymmetry algebra. the complete brst operator is built up by promoting
also the usual two-form eld gauge symmetries to a brst-symmetry. all this structure is
completely parallel to what happens in four dimensional topological yang-mills theory [2, 3].
in the latter theory it has been shown that there also exists a fermionic vectorial supersym-
metry whose anti-commutator with the brst-operator closes onto translation [4]. of course,
the existence of this additional symmetry can to some extent be motivated from the fact that
the twist of the n = 2 supersymmetry in four dimensions also gives rise to vectorial supersym-
metric partner of the brst-charge [5]. it seems therefore natural to ask also for such a vector
supersymmetry in the topological model of [1]. it is this question which we will investigate in
this paper.

the paper is organized as follows. in section two we will present the model and discuss the
brst gauge xing. motivated through the topological supersymmetry we chose a slightly dif-
ferent gauge xing action in comparison to [1]. in the next section we establish the existence of
the topological supersymmetry. we also point out the close resemblance of the transformation
rules in the present six dimensional model to the analogous transformations in four dimensional
topological yang-mills theory. finally we discuss the twist operation of the (2, 0) supersym-
metry. we not only obtain the q-operator related to the topological shift symmetry but also
a vector operator. the form of the vectorial transformation laws are again in close analogy to
the vectorial transformation laws obtained by twisting the four dimensional n = 2 super yang
mills theory. we also comment on the fact that the twist breaks the symplectic majorana-weyl
condition imposed on the six dimensional spinors and that therefore the twisted algebra closes
onto translations only up to a broken schoutens identity.

2 gauge eld and ghosts

for the construction of a tqft in six dimensions one needs two-form elds b2 = 1
dx and cb2 = 1

[cb] = 0,

in order to get a topological invariant action cl which does not vanish trivially

cl = z f3  cf3,

(1)

(2)

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

the corresponding eld strength tensors are dened by f3 = db2 and cf3 = dcb2, where
d = dx denotes the exterior derivative. the action (2) possesses two gauge symmetries

2b2 = 2 and 1 = d1,

(3)

and similar equations for cb2. 2 and 1 are a two-form and a one-form characterizing the
innitesimal gauge symmetry.

the usual brst-quantization demands that these innitesimal gauge parameters are trans-

formed into ghost elds 1

2 and v 1
1 .

corresponding to eqn.(3) the total brst operator is therefore dened by

s = q + s,

(4)

where q represents the topological shift symmetry [2] and s is the usual brst-symmetry
induced by the gauge freedom of the model. generalizing the concepts of [6] the total brst-
symmetry is constructed by the so called horizontality condition

(s + d)(cid:16)b2 + v 1
2 + 2

(s + d)(cid:16)f3 + 1

1 + m2(cid:17) = (cid:16)f3 + 1

3 gauge xing procedure

3.1 the shift symmetry

in order to implement the self-duality condition (1) one introduces a general three-form h3 =
3! hdx  dx  dx with its corresponding anti-ghost 1
1
dx  dx  dx. these
elds are members of a brst-doublet

3 = 1

3! 1

q1

 = h, qh = 0,

(13)

for the gauge-xing of the q-symmetry one proceeds similarly by an introduction of the anti-
ghost elds 2

 , 3, x 1 with their brst-doublet partners

 , q1

 = 1

q2
 = 0,
q3 = 2, q2 = 0,
qx 1 = 2, q2 = 0.

(14)

in the spirit of [1, 7] we are now able to x the shift symmetry by the following gauge conditions
`a la brst1

q = z d6x q(cid:26)1(cid:18)b +

(15)

we also included additional couplings with parameters i which are consistent with the sym-
metries, dimensions and q-charges. hence, we need another brst-doublet, which is

ql = 1

, q1

 = 0.

(16)

later on, we will see that the topological vector susy places some restrictions on these param-
eters.

using the denition of q one can eliminate the eld h by using its algebraic equation of

motion

h =

(17)

1in eqn.(15) the notation cc means terms identical to the explicit ones, which are obtained by replacing all

elds with their counterparts with index c.

in this way one gets

3.2 the s-symmetry

in order to be complete we review also the gauge xing procedure for the s-transformation of
eqn.(11) implying the existence of the corresponding anti-ghost elds and multiplier elds



= b,

sv 1
= 0,
sm2 =  1, s 1 = 0,

sb

(27)

where the vector eld v 1
existence of a anti-ghost eld n with a multiplier 1



exhibits the usual reducible gauge symmetry. this entails the

the s-gauge-xed action becomes therefore

sn = 1, s1 = 0.

(28)

gf = z d6x s(cid:26)v 1

b(cid:19) + m2(cid:16)21 + v 1

(cid:17) + n(cid:16)3 1 + v 1

 (cid:17)  cc(cid:27) .

(29)
choosing 1 = 1 and 2 = 3 = 0 this is the gauge-xed action of [1]. on the other hand if
we integrate out the multiplier elds b and  1 with their algebraic equations of motion

b =

1

( b  n) ,

 1 =

(30)

and the selection of 1 = 1 and 2  3 = 1 we nd

(31)

by construction, the complete and fully gauge-xed action

(32)

is invariant under the action of s = s + q.

the dimensions and -charges of the anti-ghost and multiplier elds are given in table 2.
finally we want to mention, that the number of bosonic degrees of freedom equals the number
of fermionic degrees of freedom. this terminates the review of the topological model presented
in [1].

4 the topological linear vector supersymmetry

it is well known that topological eld models of schwarz type are also characterized by the
fact that these models posses an additional symmetry: the topological linear vector supersym-
metry, which is responsible for the perturbative niteness of the model. in [4] is shown that
this topological linear vector susy is also present in the topological yang-mills theory in four
dimensional space-time if one uses a linear gauge condition for the shift ghost 1
 instead of the
non-linear gauge condition of this witten-type model. however, one knows that this model is
not perturbative nite. the existence of this topological linear vector susy improves consid-
erable the discussion of the algebraic renormalization procedure - leading to an anomaly free
theory [4]. additionally, one has to stress that in schwarz type models quantized in the axial
gauge the constraints coming from the vector susy allow only tree-graphs which are always
perturbatively nite.

it seems to be quite natural to investigate the possibility of the existence of this vector
susy also for the model under discussion.usually, the vector susy can be constructed from the
fact that cl is metric-independent, whereas the metric dependence emerges by the gauge-xing
procedure entailing that the energy-momentum tensor can be written as brst exact expression
[7]

t = s.

(33)

from eqn.(33) follows in a standard manner in calculating the divergence of the energy-
momentum tensor - and in considering2

z d6x t = z d6x xi




i

,

(34)

the existence of the vector susy. due to the fact that the model in question is a free abelian
one, no external unquantized sources are needed in order to describe the non-linear pieces of
s. this implies that the -symmetry is not broken linearly by the quantum elds as it is the
case for interacting topological eld models. usually, the brst-operator and the -operation
closes on on-shell on space-time translations

{s, } =  + eom.

(35)

however, for the model under consideration the wess-zumino type algebra (35) is an o-shell
relation. (35) implies that the -symmetry is in some sense the inverse of the brst-symmetry.
for the explicit construction of the vector susy have chosen a general ansatz which co-
ecients are determined by the algebra (35) and the ward identity (34). this places also
restrictions on the gauge parameters. in particular, we have to set 1 = 2 = 2 + 3 = 0 and
i = 0 to obtain a model which is invariant under the vector susy. the transformations of the
gauge eld and the ghosts then are

v 1
 = b , 2

b = 0,
1
3 = m2,

 = 0,

 ,

m2 = 0,

whereas the anti-ghosts and multipliers transform as

x 1 = n,
v 1

n

(36)

(37)

one deduces that for each brst-doublet there exists also a corresponding -doublet. it is
straight forward to prove that  (cl + q + gf ) = 0 is indeed valid.

2i stands collectively for all elds characterizing the topological eld model.

5 twist

in a next step we try to reconstruct the topological shift and vector-supersymmetry transfor-
mations of the elds through a twist of a supersymmetry multiplet. hence, we need a tensor
multiplet containing a second-rank antisymmetric tensor gauge eld. in six dimensions this is
given by a (2,0) tensor multiplet which consists of the desired tensor b, a real eld ij and
a spinor i.

the spinors in six dimensions transform under spin(1, 5)  spin(5), where spin(5) is iso-
morphic to u sp(4). u sp(4) also provides the existence of symplectic majorana-weyl spinors.
the symplectic majorana-weyl condition is


i = b 

ijj,

(38)

where  = 1, 2, 3, 4 are the spinor indices which transform under weyl-projected spin(1, 5),
whereas i = 1, 2, 3, 4 denote internal indices transforming under u sp(4). the metric ij is
real and antisymmetric and allows raising and lowering of the internal indices by i = ijj
respectively i = jji. the matrix b is unitary and acts like   = b

 and  =  b
 .

with the constraint ijij = 0 this yields three respectively ve bosonic on-shell degrees of

freedom for b and ij, and eight fermionic on-shell degrees of freedom for i [8].

in order to perform the topological twist [9] we have to break down so(1, 5) to so(5),
since so(5) is locally isomorphic to u sp(4). now the twist is done by choosing the diagonal
subgroup of the symmetry group so(5)  u sp(4). the invariant axis under so(5) will be
denoted by n = (1,~0) in the vector representation. for the spin-representation the vector n
is translated to n (). the spin(5) sub-group consists of the rotations of spin(1, 5) that
do not change n (). now technically diagonalizing so(5)  u sp(4) is done by identifying
the respective indices (  i, ...). some care is in order, as a metric, similar to ij of u sp(4) is
missing so far. as a metric of spin(5) n () has to be chosen, as it is invariant by denition
and any dierent metric would further constrain the set of rotations. identifying indices forces
one to identify the matrices as well, so one has to set

where p projects to the ve dimensional subspace p = g  nn. in [5] similar results
for the shift symmetry and the vector susy are obtained in the case of wittens topological
yang-mills theory by twisting the n = 2 supersymmetric algebra. however, we would like
to emphasize that the anticommutator {q, } as obtained from the twist does not close on
translations modula gauge transformations and equations of motion. the reason for that is,
by performing the twist one has to break the symplectic majorana-weyl condition, as already
noted in [1], in an intermediate step. the underlying six-dimensional poincare supersymmetry
makes use of schouten identities which depend on the latter condition. therefore, contrairy to
the case in four dimensions [5], the existence of the topological vector susy as given in (36) and
(37) can not be infered from the twist.
