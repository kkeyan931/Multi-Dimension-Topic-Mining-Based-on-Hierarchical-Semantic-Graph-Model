abstract

we study some aspects of short-distance interaction between parallel d3-branes in
type 0 string theory as described by the corresponding world-volume gauge theory. we
compute the one-loop eective potential in the non-supersymmetric su (n )  su (n )
gauge theory (which is a z2 projection of the u (2n ) n = 4 sym theory) representing
dyonic branes composed of n electric and n magnetic d3-branes. the branes of
the same type repel at short distances, but an electric and a magnetic brane attract,
and the forces between self-dual branes cancel. the self-dual conguration (with the
positions of the electric and the magnetic branes, i.e. the diagonal entries of the adjoint
scalar elds, being the same) is stable against separation of one electric or one magnetic
brane, but is unstable against certain modes of separation of several same-type branes.
this instability should be suppressed in the large n limit, i.e. should be irrelevant for
the large n cft interpretation of the gauge theory suggested in hep-th/9901101.

1 introduction

in recent papers [1, 2, 3, 4] it was suggested that a study of d3-branes in non-supersymmetric
type 0 string theory may be useful in attempts to extend the string/gravity  large n gauge
theory duality [5, 6] to non-supersymmetric yang-mills theories.

type 0b theory [7] has unconstrained ramond-ramond 5-form eld and thus contains
both electric and magnetic d3-branes [8, 2] which may be combined to form dyonic branes
[2, 4]. the eld theory of light string modes corresponding to parallel n electric or n
magnetic d3-branes is a truncation of n = 4 sym theory in which all fermions are excluded,
i.e. is u(n) gauge theory coupled to 6 adjoint scalars [2]. it is asymptotically free, and was
argued in [3] to have an ir xed point at innite coupling.

in [2] the string-theory cylinder diagram expression for the potential between same-type
d3-branes was found and its large-distance limit (dominated by lightest states of the closed-
string channel) was compared with the corresponding interaction potential in the eective
low-energy gravitational theory.
it was found that at large distances the branes attract
because of the contribution of the bulk tachyon eld (but would repel if the closed-string
tachyon is removed from the spectrum).

in the supersymmetric type ii theory the leading non-vanishing term in the interaction
potential between (e.g., moving) branes has the same behavior at short and at large distances
[9, 10]. this property is based on a certain non-renormalization theorem (cf. [11]), e.g., the
coecient of the v4
x4 term in the string expression (which, in general, is expected to be a
x , i.e. to receive contributions from massive open string modes) turns out
function of
to be a constant [9]. since this non-renormalization is a consequence of supersymmetry,
there is no reason to expect a similar small distance  large distance relation in the non-
supersymmetric type 0 theory case.

the expression for the cylinder amplitude [2] seems to imply (depending on a regular-
ization of short-distance divergence) that branes of the same type repel at short distances.
the force between electric and magnetic branes is the same in value but opposite in sign [4],
i.e. they attract at short distances.
as in the case of type ii theory [9], the short distance (x < ) interaction between
d-branes should be dominated by the light open string modes, i.e. should be described by
the one-loop eective potential in the corresponding gauge theory.1 indeed, the presence of
a repelling force between two electric (or two magnetic) branes can be seen directly from the
corresponding eld-theory calculation of the scalar eective potential in [12] (assuming that
one-loop induced masses are ne-tuned to zero).

a self-dual type 0 d3-brane is found by putting together an electric and a magnetic d3-
brane [2]. since an open string connecting these two branes is a fermion [8, 2], the resulting
low-energy world-volume eld theory contains not only the massless bosons for each of the
branes but also the massless fermions [4]. the perturbative type 0 string theory calculation
of the interaction potential between two such self-dual branes gives (just as in the case of
type iib d3-branes [13]) the vanishing result at all distances [4]. moreover, the potential

1 it is important here that the open string channel does not contain tachyon [1, 2, 8]. truncation to
massless open string modes is possible when the masses of the stretched strings are much less than those of
excited open string modes, x

between an electric (or magnetic) brane and a self-dual brane also vanishes. these results
may be interpreted as being due to cancellations between the bosonic (electric-electric and
magnetic-magnetic) repulsion and the fermionic (electric-magnetic) attraction.

the eld theory on n electric and n magnetic parallel type 0 d3-branes contains, in
addition to the u(n)  u(n) gauge eld and 6 adjoint scalars, also 4 weyl fermions in the
(n, n) representation of u(n)  u(n) and 4 weyl fermions in the (n , n) representation
[4]. this non-supersymmetric gauge theory may be interpreted as a special z2 projection
of the u(2n) n = 4 sym theory [4]: one is to keep the elds invariant under change of
sign of fermions combined with the global u(2n) gauge transformation x  ixi1, i =
(cid:18) i
0 i(cid:19) (i is the n  n identity matrix). the i-transformation changes signs of the
o-diagonal n  n blocks of u(2n) matrices, implying that the resulting so(6) invariant
theory should contain only diagonal (u(n)u(n)) bosons and o-diagonal (bifundamental)
fermions.
as was argued in [4], in the large n limit this su(n)su(n) non-supersymmetric gauge
theory (with u(1) u(1) part assumed to be decoupled) is expected to be a conformal eld
theory.2
it was checked that the one-loop gauge coupling beta-function indeed vanishes,
while the 2-loop beta-function and the planar parts of the one-loop renormalizations of the
scalar potential and the yukawa coupling matrix vanish to the leading order in large n.3

our aim below is to further explore some perturbative properties of this gauge theory.
we shall compute the one-loop eective potential for the diagonal scalar elds represent-
ing short-distance interaction between separated branes. the resulting expression will be
a generalization of the potential in the purely-electric theory case [12]: it will have a sim-
ple structure of the sum of the bosonic (electric-electric and magnetic-magnetic) and the
fermionic (electric-magnetic) contributions. in agreement with the string-theory result [4]
that the self-dual branes do not interact, we will nd that the potential indeed vanishes in
the case when the scalar eld backgrounds for the two su(n) groups (i.e. the positions of
the electric and the magnetic constituents) are taken to be equal.

having found the expression for the one-loop eective potential (sect.2), we shall then
analyze stability of the self-dual conguration of branes corresponding to the same diagonal
entries of the two sets of 6 scalar elds (sect.3). while the self-dual conguration is stable
against separation of one electric or one magnetic brane, we shall nd that it is unstable
against separation of several same-type (electric or magnetic) branes. the instability disap-
pears at nite temperature t (sect.4): the stack of coincident like-charge branes becomes a
metastable state, and dissociation of a multiply charged brane into elementary constituents
ceases to be energetically favorable at some t = tc (this is similar to the nite-temperature
restoration of spontaneously broken symmetry in the higgs model). as we shall discuss in
sect.5, this instability is likely to be suppressed in the large n limit, i.e. should be irrelevant
for the large n cft interpretation of the su(n)  su(n) gauge theory suggested in [4].

2 similar (but somewhat more complicated, having less global symmetry) large n conformal orbifold

gauge theories were considered in [14, 15, 16]..

2 one-loop eective potential

to write down the action of the su(n)  su(n) gauge theory and to compute the corre-
sponding quantum eective potential it is simplest to view it as a reduction to 4 dimensions
of a non-supersymmetric ten-dimensional gauge theory (this is indeed the way how it orig-
inates from string theory).4 the latter d = 10 gauge theory is the (1)f  i projection [4]
of the n = 1, d = 10 supersymmetric u(2n) yang-mills theory [18].
the eld-theory content (i.e. the low-energy degrees of freedom on parallel n electric and
n magnetic d3-branes) is then described by the u(n) u(n) d = 10 gauge potentials and
ten-dimensional majorana-weyl spinors in (n, n) and ( n , n) representations of u(n) 
u(n) [4]. gauge potentials are embedded in u(2n) diagonally

(2.5)
4 for simplicity, we shall rst assume that the gauge group is u (n )  u (n ) as it directly follows from
the d-branes in at space picture [17, 4]. the truncation to the su (n )  su (n ) case [4] will be easy to
do in the nal one-loop expressions since the bosons of the two groups do not mix and the contributions of
both u (1)s decouple. the dierence between su (n ) and u (n ) cases is irrelevant in the large n limit.

5 in more detail, the 10-d real mw fermions of u (2n ) gauge theory are represented by i, 11i = i ,
i = 1, ..., 4n 2. to describe the projection one multiplies them by the hermitian 2n  2n matrix generators
t i of u (2n ) and then sets the diagonal entries to zero. the o-diagonal eld  is thus a complex weyl
spinor. the matrix form of the fermionic action is obtained by using that tr(t it j ) = 1

our aim below is to compute the one-loop eective action  = r d4xve() in this con-

potential vanishes in n = 4 sym theory where the classical moduli space is not deformed
at the quantum level, but is non-trivial in the non-supersymmetric projected theory (2.4).

this integral diverges in the uv region (t  0) and requires renormalization. we shall
assume that appropriate counterterms cancel quartic and quadratic power-like divergencies
and promote the logarithm of the cuto to the logarithm of a characteristic energy scale 
1 in the context of comparison with string theory). in general,

would correspond to keeping the scalar elds massless at the one-loop level. while in the
purely electric theory this ne tuning may seem unnatural (in the absence of supersymmetry
adjoint scalars may get masses at loop level [2]), it is formally possible (see also footnote
below eq. (2.13) and section 3 for a discussion of this point). fortunately, this ne-tuning

will not be needed in the self-dual su(n)  su(n) theory we are actually interested in

this potential is repulsive at short distances and attractive at large ones, see g. 1 (note that

the interaction between the two parallel electric branes [2]

where we used the notation of [21] (and suppressed the space-time volume factor). the short-

where the two-body interaction potential v is the same as in the bosonic case (2.10).10 the
loop of the massless fermionic string states leads to the interaction between the electric and
the magnetic branes equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign, to the bosonic loop interaction
between same-type branes (g. 2). this is in agreement with the full string-theory result
[2, 4] for the electricmagnetic brane interaction which is given by (2.12) taken with the
opposite sign.

(which is an ir eect from closed string theory point of view). the power-like divergencies would be absent
in any analytic (e.g., dimensional) regularization of this integral which would ensure that light modes of
1 . such a regularization assumption
stretched open strings remain light and not get masses of order
seems to correspond to a special regime possible in the large n limit. this is suggested by the existence
in the eective low-energy gravity theory of an electric large charge 3-brane solution [2, 22, 3] interpolating
between the two ads5  s5 uv and ir conformal points. there may be other ir solutions corresponding
to scalars becoming massive [23].
10 we are assuming that the bosonic and fermionic determinants are regularized in the same way, i.e.
the scale  is the same in both cases. the string-theory (or n = 4 sym projection) origin of the theory
under consideration implies that this is indeed the right regularization prescription. as a result, the eective
potential will vanish for the self-dual congurations of branes (see eq. (2.17) below), in agreement with the
vanishing of the corresponding cylinder amplitude in string theory.

11 the double-trace term originating from non-planar diagrams (with two scalar legs on one boundary of
a loop, and two  on another) is subleading in the large n limit  the traces of the external or background
elds are nite for n   (equivalently, one needs to separate a factor of n in the divergent part of the
one-loop eective action to combine it with the gauge coupling into n g2
ym which is to be xed in the large
n limit). we are grateful to i. klebanov for a discussion of this issue and also for suggesting to put the
ln 2 term in (2.17) in the form (2.19), which is a special case of the double-trace expression

(ve )ln 2 =

although the counterterm of this form when added to the bare action seems to give the leading order n 2
contributions, it actually produces only subleading contribution for n   due to the large n factorization.
in calculating diagrams or in schwinger-dyson equations one of the traces in the double-trace expression
can be factorized and replaced by its vacuum average which is zero in the self-dual vacuum. similar remarks
apply to the u (n )  u (n ) theory (which is equivalent to su (n )  su (n ) one in the large n limit). in
particular, the quadratic divergence term here, while non-vanishing, has (like the logarithmic term) the
double-trace form, (ve )2 = c12[tr(e)i  tr(m)i]2, and thus is subleading at large n .

3 some properties of eective potential

there are some obvious properties of the expression (2.17) for the eective potential. first,
the whole potential (and, in particular, (2.19)) vanishes for a self-dual conguration of d-
branes, i.e. when the positions of the electric and the magnetic branes are taken to be the
same,

(e)i = ya
ya

(m)i .

(3.1)

this is in agreement with the vanishing of the corresponding string-theory cylinder amplitude
[2, 4]. it also follows from (2.17) that the self-dual branes do not interact either with electric
or with magnetic branes.

in the case of the bosonic theory on purely electric branes, the eective potential (2.9)
[12] (dened according to (2.11)) exhibits the typical coleman-weinberg behavior [19]  the
u(n) world-volume symmetry appears to be spontaneously broken to [u(1)]n by radiative
corrections. this means that the stack of electric d3-branes is unstable against separation;
in the equilibrium conguration all n branes are separated by distances of order .

(e) = ys

the potential of the self-dual brane theory (2.17) expanded near the self-dual point (3.1)
has stable, valley-type, and unstable directions. separating a single electric (or magnetic)
brane away from the rest of n  1 electric and n magnetic branes gives the same attractive
force (for y  ) as between a single electric and a single magnetic brane, i.e. this is a
stable direction. an example of a valley in eld space is a separation of some number of
self-dual branes (ys

(m), s = 1, ..., m) from the remaining (n  m) self-dual ones.

if we allow the electric and magnetic branes to be separated, the eective potential can
become negative due to the repulsion of the same-type branes at short distances. this
repulsion makes self-dual conguration of branes unstable. an example of an unstable
direction is obtained by separating two electric branes along some axis by distances 
from the remaining stack of coinciding n  2 electric and n magnetic branes. the energy
density of such conguration is then the same as of the system of two electric branes at
positions y =  and y =  and two coinciding magnetic branes at the origin y = 0 (note
that the n-dependent contributions in (2.17) cancel out)12

(3.2)

the self-dual point  = 0 is a local maximum, rather than a minimum, of the energy
e() (see g. 1). the branes thus tend to separate by distances of order . the behavior
of the eective potential for    is non-perturbative in eld theory, so an equilibrium
conguration of branes cannot be reliably determined in the one-loop approximation.13
the above calculation of the eective potential is not limited to the case of equal numbers
of electric and magnetic branes. the world-volume theory on a dyonic brane formed by q

12 this type of instability depends, of course, on particular form of the two-body interaction potential.
for example, it is absent in the case of the coulomb-like interaction: the forces in the neutral system of two

positive charges q at points y =  and a negative charge 2q at y = 0 are attractive ( q2
13 let us note that the electric-magnetic duality symmetry can be interpreted from the world-volume point
of view as a z2 symmetry interchanging a(e) with a(m), (e) with (m), and  with  in (2.4). instability
may be interpreted as a spontaneous breaking of this z2 symmetry.

interaction potential between electric branes for dierent temperatures. the

electric and p magnetic branes has u(q)  u(p ) gauge bosons and adjoint scalars and
fermions in the (q, p ) and ( q, p ) representations. the eective potential in the generic
case is given by the same eq. (2.17) with the appropriate ranges of summation (a = 1, ..., q
and b = 1, ..., p ).14

4 eective potential at non-zero temperature

generalization of the eective potential to the case of non-zero temperature is straightfor-
ward: the integration over p0 component of momentum in (2.10) should be replaced by
summation over matsubara frequences, even for bosons and odd for fermions. the proper-
time representation for the bosonic loop integral (2.10) at nite temperature changes to (see,
e.g., [24])

vb(r, t ) =

the temperature qualitatively changes the behavior of the eective potential. at short
distances it becomes attractive, since combining the high-temperature expansion of the
thermal correction to the eective potential [24] (the expansion parameter is r
t ) with its

asymptotically free: its one-loop gauge theory beta functions for the two u (n ) couplings are proportional

the temperature is assumed to be small compared to  (i.e. r < t < ) and the coecient

although at large r the contribution of massive open string states can no longer be neglected
and large-distance interaction of d-branes is not under control in the world-volume eld
theory, one expects, as in [12], that the potential has a global minimum at some r  . the
location of the potential peak, r0, increases with the temperature, along with the hight of
the potential barrier. one also expects that the free energy in the global minimum should
grow [24]. at some temperature t = tc  , the free energies at zero and at the symmetry-
breaking minimum become equal to each other and for t > tc the global minimum of the
free energy is at r = 0 (see g. 3). this is the well-known picture of symmetry restoration
at nite temperature [25].

in the high-temperature phase the u(n) symmetry is restored, i.e.

the equilibrium
conguration corresponds to all n branes accumulating at one point. similar conclusion is
reached in the case of the type iib theory d3-branes [26]. the strong-coupling counterpart
of this fact is non-existence of stable separated-brane supergravity solutions in the non-
extremal case  when the energy of the system is larger than the total charge, branes attract
and form a single black brane.

in the u(n)  u(n) theory of n electric and n magnetic branes the nite temperature

eective potential has the same structure as at t = 0, eq. (2.17),

but now the fermionic and bosonic two-body potentials vb and vf are not the same. the

as we have seen in the previous section, at zero temperature the self-dual vacuum (3.1) of
the world-volume gauge theory is unstable because of the repulsive forces between same-type
constituent branes. for the same reasons as in the purely bosonic theory, we expect that
this instability disappears at some critical temperature of order  (the self-dual vacuum is
metastable at any non-zero temperature). as in the type ii theory case, at nite temperature
separated self-dual branes start attracting and should form a single-center cluster.

5 discussion

in this paper we considered some aspects of short-distance interactions between d3-branes
in type 0 string theory described by the corresponding world-volume eld theory. we con-
centrated on the self-dual branes in at space at weak coupling, i.e. on the perturbative
su(n)  su(n) gauge theory of [4]. we computed the one-loop eective potential in this
eld theory and found that the self-dual d3-brane conguration (3.1) is perturbatively un-
stable  constituent electric and magnetic branes tend to separate to distances  which
should naturally be of order .

in the large n limit this su(n)su(n) theory is expected to have a dual representation
in terms of the classical type 0 string theory on ads5s5 background with n units of electric
and n units of magnetic 5-form ux [4]. this implies that the large n limit of this gauge
theory should represent a 4-d cft [4].

the perturbative instability of the self-dual conguration discussed above should not
modify this conclusion  it is to be absent in the part of the eective potential which is
dominant in the large n limit.15

(m)). together with n and g2

the su(n)su(n) theory has a classical moduli space with coordinates being positions
of the branes (ya
ym they play the role of parameters of
the theory. the cft should be dened by a xed point in the whole parameter space:
n  , n g2
(m). the formal one-loop quantum-mechanical instability of
the self-dual point should be irrelevant in this context: the large n cft may be dened
by a proper set of conformal composite operators (and their correlation functions) which,
roughly, does not include operators vanishing for (e) = (m). like for the non-planar
logarithmically divergent terms (tr2
(m))2 in the one-loop eective action (2.19), the
contributions of such operators in correlation functions should vanish in the conformal limit.
that means that uctuations with tr2
(m) should be eectively forbidden, i.e. the
above instability should be suppressed.16

15 indeed, it may seem natural to ignore the eect of separation of a few electric or magnetic branes from
a cluster of large number (2n ) of branes. simultaneous separation of a large number m  n of branes
should be statistically suppressed.

16 we are grateful to i. klebanov for this suggestion.
