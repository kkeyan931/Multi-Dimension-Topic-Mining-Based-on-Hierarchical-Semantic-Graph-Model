conformal field theory

1. introduction

2

conformal eld theories have been at the centre of much attention during the last fteen
years since they are relevant for at least three dierent areas of modern theoretical
physics: conformal eld theories provide toy models for genuinely interacting quantum
eld theories, they describe two-dimensional critical phenomena, and they play a central
role in string theory, at present the most promising candidate for a unifying theory of
all forces. conformal eld theories have also had a major impact on various aspects of
modern mathematics, in particular the theory of vertex operator algebras and borcherds
algebras, nite groups, number theory and low-dimensional topology.

from an abstract point of view, conformal eld theories are euclidean quantum
eld theories that are characterised by the property that their symmetry group
contains, in addition to the euclidean symmetries, local conformal transformations, i.e.
transformations that preserve angles but not lengths. the local conformal symmetry
is of special importance in two dimensions since the corresponding symmetry algebra
is innite-dimensional in this case. as a consequence, two-dimensional conformal eld
theories have an innite number of conserved quantities, and are completely solvable by
symmetry considerations alone.

as a bona de quantum eld theory, the requirement of conformal invariance
is very restrictive.
in particular, since the theory is scale invariant, all particle-like
excitations of the theory are necessarily massless. this might be seen as a strong
argument against any possible physical relevance of such theories. however, all particles
of any (two-dimensional) quantum eld theory are approximately massless in the limit
of high energy, and many structural features of quantum eld theories are believed to be
unchanged in this approximation. furthermore, it is possible to analyse deformations of
conformal eld theories that describe integrable massive models [1, 2]. finally, it might
be hoped that a good mathematical understanding of interactions in any model theory
should have implications for realistic theories.

the more recent interest in conformal eld theories has dierent origins.

in
the description of statistical mechanics in terms of euclidean quantum eld theories,
conformal eld theories describe systems at the critical point, where the correlation
length diverges. one simple system where this occurs is the so-called ising model. this
model is formulated in terms of a two-dimensional lattice whose lattice sites represent
atoms of an (innite) two-dimensional crystal. each atom is taken to have a spin variable
i that can take the values 1, and the magnetic energy of the system is the sum over
pairs of adjacent atoms

ij .

e =x(ij)

if we consider the system at a nite temperature t , the thermal average h  i behaves
as

hiji  hii  hji  exp(cid:18)

|i  j|

 (cid:19) ,

(2)

conformal field theory

where |i  j|  1 and  is the so-called correlation length that is a function of the
temperature t . observable (magnetic) properties can be derived from such correlation
functions, and are therefore directly aected by the actual value of .

the system possesses a critical temperature, at which the correlation length 
diverges, and the exponential decay in (2) is replaced by a power law. the continuum
theory that describes the correlation functions for distances that are large compared to
the lattice spacing is then scale invariant. every scale-invariant two-dimensional local
quantum eld theory is actually conformally invariant [3], and the critical point of the
ising model is therefore described by a conformal eld theory [4]. (the conformal eld
theory in question will be briey described at the end of section 4.)

the ising model is only a rather rough approximation to the actual physical system.
however, the continuum theory at the critical point  and in particular the dierent
critical exponents that describe the power law behaviour of the correlation functions
at the critical point  are believed to be fairly insensitive to the details of the chosen
model; this is the idea of universality. thus conformal eld theory is a very important
method in the study of critical systems.

the second main area in which conformal eld theory has played a major role is
string theory [5, 6]. string theory is a generalised quantum eld theory in which the
basic objects are not point particles (as in ordinary quantum eld theory) but one
dimensional strings. these strings can either form closed loops (closed string theory),
or they can have two end-points, in which case the theory is called open string theory.
strings interact by joining together and splitting into two; compared to the interaction
of point particles where two particles come arbitrarily close together, the interaction of
strings is more spread out, and thus many divergencies of ordinary quantum eld theory
are absent.

unlike point particles, a string has internal degrees of freedom that describe the
dierent ways in which it can vibrate in the ambient space-time. these dierent
vibrational modes are interpreted as the particles of the theory  in particular,
the whole particle spectrum of the theory is determined in terms of one fundamental
object. the vibrations of the string are most easily described from the point of view of
the so-called world-sheet, the two-dimensional surface that the string sweeps out as it
propagates through space-time; in fact, as a theory on the world-sheet the vibrations of
the string are described by a conformal eld theory.

in closed string theory, the oscillations of the string can be decomposed into
two waves which move in opposite directions around the loop. these two waves are
essentially independent of each other, and the theory therefore factorises into two so-
called chiral conformal eld theories. many properties of the local theory can be studied
separately for the two chiral theories, and we shall therefore mainly analyse the chiral
theory in this article. the main advantage of this approach is that the chiral theory can
be studied using the powerful tools of complex analysis since its correlation functions
are analytic functions. the chiral theories also play a crucial role for conformal eld
theories that are dened on manifolds with boundaries, and that are relevant for the

conformal field theory

description of open string theory.

all known consistent string theories can be obtained by compactication from a
rather small number of theories. these include the ve dierent supersymmetric string
theories in ten dimensions, as well as a number of non-supersymmetric theories that are
dened in either ten or twenty-six dimensions. the recent advances in string theory have
centered around the idea of duality, namely that these theories are further related in the
sense that the strong coupling regime of one theory is described by the weak coupling
regime of another. a crucial element in these developments has been the realisation that
the solitonic objects that dene the relevant degrees of freedom at strong coupling are
dirichlet-branes that have an alternative description in terms of open string theory [7].
in fact, the eect of a dirichlet brane is completely described by adding certain open
string sectors (whose end-points are xed to lie on the world-volume of the brane) to the
theory. the possible dirichlet branes of a given string theory are then selected by the
condition that the resulting theory of open and closed strings must be consistent. these
consistency conditions contain (and may be equivalent to) the consistency conditions of
conformal eld theory on a manifold with a boundary [810]. much of the structure of
the theory that we shall explain in this review article is directly relevant for an analysis
of these questions, although we shall not discuss the actual consistency conditions (and
their solutions) here.

any review article of a well-developed subject such as conformal eld theory will
miss out important elements of the theory, and this article is no exception. we have
chosen to present one coherent route through some section of the theory and we shall
not discuss in any detail alternative view points on the subject. the approach that
we have taken is in essence algebraic (although we shall touch upon some questions of
analysis), and is inspired by the work of goddard [11] as well as the mathematical theory
of vertex operator algebras that was developed by borcherds [12, 13], frenkel, lepowsky
& meurman [14], frenkel, huang & lepowsky [15], zhu [16], kac [17] and others. this
algebraic approach will be fairly familiar to many physicists, but we have tried to give
it a somewhat new slant by emphasising the fundamental role of the amplitudes. we
have also tried to explain some of the more recent developments in the mathematical
theory of vertex operator algebras that have so far not been widely appreciated in the
physics community, in particular, the work of zhu.

there exist in essence two other view points on the subject: a functional analytic
approach in which techniques from algebraic quantum eld theory [18] are employed and
which has been pioneered by wassermann [19] and gabbiani and frohlich [20]; and a
geometrical approach that is inspired by string theory (for example the work of friedan
& shenker [21]) and that has been put on a solid mathematical foundation by segal [22]
(see also huang [23, 24]).

we shall also miss out various recent developments of the theory, in particular the
progress in understanding conformal eld theories on higher genus riemann surfaces
[2529], and on surfaces with boundaries [3035].

conformal field theory

finally, we should mention that a number of treatments of conformal eld theory
are by now available, in particular the review articles of ginsparg [36] and gawedzki [37],
and the book by di francesco, mathieu and senechal [38]. we have attempted to be
somewhat more general, and have put less emphasis on specic well understood models
such as the minimal models or the wznw models (although they will be explained in
due course). we have also been more inuenced by the mathematical theory of vertex
operator algebras, although we have avoided to phrase the theory in this language.

the paper is organised as follows. in section 2, we outline the general structure of
the theory, and explain how the various ingredients that will be subsequently described
t together. section 3 is devoted to the study of meromorphic conformal eld theory;
this is the part of the theory that describes in essence what is sometimes called the
chiral algebra by physicists, or the vertex operator algebra by mathematicians. we
also introduce the most important examples of conformal eld theories, and describe
standard constructions such as the coset and orbifold construction.
in section 4 we
introduce the concept of a representation of the meromorphic conformal eld theory, and
explain the role of zhus algebra in classifying (a certain class of) such representations.
section 5 deals with higher correlation functions and fusion rules. we explain verlindes
formula, and give a brief account of the polynomial relations of moore & seiberg and
their relation to quantum groups. we also describe logarithmic conformal eld theories.
we conclude in section 6 with a number of general open problems that deserve, in
our opinion, more work. finally, we have included an appendix that contains a brief
summary about the dierent denitions of rationality.

2. the general structure of a local conformal field theory

let us begin by describing somewhat sketchily what the general structure of a local
conformal eld theory is, and how the various structures that will be discussed in detail
later t together.

2.1. the space of states

in essence, a two-dimensional conformal eld theory (like any other eld theory) is
determined by its space of states and the collection of its correlation functions. the
space of states is a vector space hhh (that may or may not be a hilbert space), and the
correlation functions are dened for collections of vectors in some dense subspace fff
of hhh. these correlation functions are dened on a two-dimensional space-time, which
we shall always assume to be of euclidean signature. we shall mainly be interested in
the case where the space-time is a closed compact surface. these surfaces are classied
(topologically) by their genus g which counts the number of handles; the simplest such
surface is the sphere with g = 0, the surface with g = 1 is the torus, etc. in a rst step
we shall therefore consider conformal eld theories that are dened on the sphere; as we
shall explain later, under certain conditions it is possible to associate to such a theory

conformal field theory

6

families of theories that are dened on surfaces of arbitrary genus. this is important in
the context of string theory where the perturbative expansion consists of a sum over all
such theories (where the genus of the surface plays the role of the loop order).

one of the special features of conformal eld theory is the fact that the theory
on a surface
is naturally dened on a riemann surface (or complex curve),
in the case of the sphere, the complex
that possesses suitable complex coordinates.
coordinates can be taken to be those of the complex plane that cover the sphere except
for the point at innity; complex coordinates around innity are dened by means
of the coordinate function (z) = 1/z that maps a neighbourhood of innity to a
neighbourhood of 0. with this choice of complex coordinates, the sphere is usually
referred to as the riemann sphere, and this choice of complex coordinates is up to some
suitable class of reparametrisations unique. the correlation functions of a conformal
eld theory that is dened on the sphere are thus of the form

i.e.

hv (1; z1, z1)    v (n; zn, zn)i ,

(3)

where v (, z) is the eld that is associated to the state , i  fff  hhh, and zi and zi
are complex numbers (or innity). these correlation functions are assumed to be local,
i.e. independent of the order in which the elds appear in (3).

one of the properties that makes two-dimensional conformal eld theories exactly
solvable is the fact that the theory contains a large (innite-dimensional) symmetry
algebra with respect to which the states in hhh fall into representations. this symmetry
algebra is directly related (in a way we shall describe below) to a certain preferred
subspace f0 of fff that is characterised by the property that the correlation functions
(3) of its states depend only on the complex parameter z, but not on its complex
conjugate z. more precisely, a state   fff is in f0 if for any collection of i  fff  hhh,
the correlation functions

hv (; z, z)v (1; z1, z1)    v (n; zn, zn)i

(4)

do not depend on z. the correlation functions that involve only states in f0 are then
analytic functions on the sphere. these correlation functions dene the meromorphic
(sub)theory [11] that will be the main focus of the next section.

similarly, we can consider the subspace of states f 0 that consists of those states
for which the correlation functions of the form (4) do not depend on z. these states
dene an (anti-)meromorphic conformal eld theory which can be analysed by the same
methods as a meromorphic conformal eld theory. the two meromorphic conformal
subtheories encode all the information about the symmetries of the theory, and for the
most interesting class of theories, the so-called nite or rational theories, the whole
theory can be reconstructed from them up to some nite ambiguity. in essence, this
means that the whole theory is determined by symmetry considerations alone, and this
is at the heart of the solvability of the theory.

 our use of the term meromorphic conformal eld theory is dierent from that employed by, e.g.,
schellekens [39].

the correlation functions of the theory determine the operator product expansion
(ope) of the conformal elds which expresses the operator product of two elds in
terms of a sum of single elds. if 1 and 2 are two arbitrary states in fff then the ope
of 1 and 2 is an expansion of the form

v (1; z1, z1)v (2; z2, z2)

= xi

(z1  z2)i(z1  z2) i xr,s0

v (i

r,s; z2, z2)(z1  z2)r(z1  z2)s ,

(5)

where i and i are real numbers, r, s  in and i
r,s  fff . the actual form of this
expansion can be read o from the correlation functions of the theory since the identity
(5) has to hold in all correlation functions, i.e.

(6)

dv (1; z1, z1)v (2; z2, z2)v (1; w1, w1)    v (n; wn, wn)e

= xi

(z1  z2)i(z1  z2) i xr,s0
dv (i

r,s; z2, z2)v (1; w1, w1)    v (n; wn, wn)e

(z1  z2)r(z1  z2)s

for all j  fff. if both states 1 and 2 belong to the meromorphic subtheory f0, (6)
only depends on zi, and i
r,s also belongs to the meromorphic subtheory f0. the ope
therefore denes a certain product on the meromorphic elds. since the product involves
the complex parameters zi in a non-trivial way, it does not directly dene an algebra;
the resulting structure is usually called a vertex (operator) algebra in the mathematical
literature [12, 14], and we shall adopt this name here as well.

by virtue of its denition in terms of (6), the operator product expansion is

associative, i.e.

(cid:16)v (1; z1, z1)v (2; z2, z2)(cid:17)v (3; z3, z3) = v (1; z1, z1)(cid:16)v (2; z2, z2)v (3; z3, z3)(cid:17) ,

where the brackets indicate which ope is evaluated rst. if we consider the case where
both 1 and 2 are meromorphic elds (i.e. in f0), then the associativity of the ope
implies that the states in fff form a representation of the vertex operator algebra. the
same also holds for the vertex operator algebra associated to the anti-meromorphic
elds, and we can thus decompose the whole space fff (or hhh) as

(7)

hhh(j,) ,

(8)

hhh =m(j,)

where each hhh(j,) is an (indecomposable) representation of the two vertex operator
algebras. finite theories are characterised by the property that only nitely many
indecomposable representations of the two vertex operator algebras occur in (8).

2.2. modular invariance

the decomposition of the space of states in terms of representations of the two vertex
operator algebras throws considerable light on the problem of whether the theory is well-
dened on higher riemann surfaces. one necessary constraint for this (which is believed

conformal field theory

8

also to be sucient [40]) is that the vacuum correlator on the torus is independent of its
parametrisation. every two-dimensional torus can be described as the quotient space of
ir2  c by the relations z  z + w1 and z  z + w2, where w1 and w2 are not parallel.
the complex structure of the torus is invariant under rotations and rescalings of c, and
therefore every torus is conformally equivalent to (i.e. has the same complex structure
as) a torus for which the relations are z  z + 1 and z  z +  , and  is in the upper
half plane of c. it is also easy to see that  , t ( ) =  + 1 and s( ) = 1/ describe
conformally equivalent tori; the two maps t and s generate the group sl(2, z)/z2 that
consists of matrices of the form

where a, b, c, d  z ,

ad  bc = 1 ,

(9)

a =  a b
c d !

and the matrices a and a have the same action on  ,

 7 a =

a + b
c + d

.

(10)

the parameter  is sometimes called the modular parameter of the torus, and the group
sl(2, z)/z2 is called the modular group (of the torus).

given a conformal eld theory that is dened on the riemann sphere, the vacuum
correlator on the torus can be determined as follows. first, we cut the torus along one
of its non-trivial cycles; the resulting surface is a cylinder (or an annulus) whose shape
depends on one complex parameter q. since the annulus is a subset of the sphere, the
conformal eld theory on the annulus is determined in terms of the theory on the sphere.
in particular, the states that can propagate in the annulus are precisely the states of
the theory as dened on the sphere.

in order to reobtain the torus from the annulus, we have to glue the two ends of
the annulus together; in terms of conformal eld theory this means that we have to sum
over a complete set of states. the vacuum correlator on the torus is therefore described
by a trace over the whole space of states, the partition function of the theory,

trhhh(j,) (o(q, q)) ,

(11)

x(j,)

where o(q, q) is the operator that describes the propagation of the states along the
annulus,

o(q, q) = ql0 c

24 q l0 c

24 .

(12)
here l0 and l0 are the scaling operators of the two vertex operator algebras and c and
c their central charges; this will be discussed in more detail in the following section.
the propagator depends on the actual shape of the annulus that is described in terms
of the complex parameter q. for a given torus that is described by  , there is a natural
choice for how to cut the torus into an annulus, and the complex parameter q that is
associated to this annulus is q = e2i . since the tori that are described by  and a
(where a  sl(2, z)) are equivalent, the vacuum correlator is only well-dened provided
that (11) is invariant under this transformation. this provides strong constraints on
the spectrum of the theory.

for most conformal eld theories (although not for all, see for example [41]) each
of the spaces hhh(j,)
is a tensor product of an irreducible representation hj of the
meromorphic vertex operator algebra and an irreducible representation h of the anti-
meromorphic vertex operator algebra. in this case, the vacuum correlator on the torus
(11) takes the form

j(q) (q) ,

(13)

x(j,)

where j is the character of the representation hj of the meromorphic vertex operator
algebra,

j( ) = trhj (ql0 c
24 )

where

q = e2i ,

(14)

and likewise for . one of the remarkable facts about many vertex operator algebras
(that has now been proven for a certain class of them [16], see also [42]) is the property
that the characters transform into one another under modular transformations,

where s and t are constant matrices, i.e. independent of  . in this case, writing

sjk k( )

and

tjk k( ) ,

(15)

j( + 1) =xk

(16)

j(1/ ) =xk
hhh =mi,

mi hi  h ,

xi,

silmi sk =xi,

where mi  in denotes the multiplicity with which the tensor product hi  h appears
in hhh, the torus vacuum correlation function is well dened provided that

tilmi tk = mlk ,

(17)

and s and t are the matrices dened as in (15) for the representations of the anti-
meromorphic vertex operator algebra. this provides very powerful constraints for the
multiplicity matrices mi. in particular, in the case of a nite theory (for which each of
the two vertex operator algebras has only nitely many irreducible representations) these
conditions typically only allow for a nite number of solutions that can be classied;
this has been done for the case of the so-called minimal models and the ane theories
with group su(2) by cappelli, itzykson and zuber [43,44] (for a modern proof involving
some galois theory see [45]), and for the ane theories with group su(3) and the n = 2
superconformal minimal models by gannon [46, 47].

this concludes our brief overview over the general structure of a local conformal
eld theory. for the rest of the paper we shall mainly concentrate on the theory that is
dened on the sphere. let us begin by analysing the meromorphic conformal subtheory
in some detail.

3. meromorphic conformal field theory

in this section we shall describe in detail the structure of a meromorphic conformal
eld theory; our exposition follows closely the work of goddard [11] and gaberdiel &
goddard [48], and we refer the reader for some of the mathematical details (that shall
be ignored in the following) to these papers.

3.1. amplitudes and mobius covariance

as we have explained above, a meromorphic conformal eld theory is determined in
terms of its space of states h0, and the amplitudes involving arbitrary elements i in a
dense subspace f0 of h0. indeed, for each state   f0, there exists a vertex operator
v (, z) that creates the state  from the vacuum (in a sense that will be described
in more detail shortly), and the amplitudes are the vacuum expectation values of the
corresponding product of vertex operators,

a(1, . . . , n; z1, . . . , zn) = hv (1, z1)    v (n, zn)i .

(18)

each vertex operator v (, z) depends linearly on , and the amplitudes are meromor-
phic functions that are dened on the riemann sphere p = c  {}, i.e. they are
analytic except for possible poles at zi = zj, i 6= j. the operators are furthermore
assumed to be local in the sense that for z 6= 

v (, z)v (, ) =  v (, )v (, z) ,

(19)

where  = 1 if both  and  are fermionic, and  = +1 otherwise. in formulating (19)
we have assumed that  and  are states of denite fermion number; more precisely,
this means that f0 decomposes as

f0 = f b

0  f f
0 ,

(20)

0 and f f

where f b
both  and  are either in f b
states of denite fermion number.

0 is the subspace of bosonic and fermionic states, respectively, and that
0 . in the following we shall always only consider

0 or in f f

in terms of the amplitudes, the locality condition (19) is equivalent to the property

that

a(1, . . . , i, i+1, . . . , n; z1, . . . , zi, zi+1, . . . , zn)

= i,i+1a(1, . . . , i+1, i, . . . , n; z1, . . . , zi+1, zi, . . . , zn) ,

(21)

and i,i+1 is dened as above. as the amplitudes are essentially independent of the order
of the elds, we shall sometimes also write them as

a(1, . . . , n; z1, . . . , zn) = h

v (i, zi)i .

nyi=1

(22)

conformal field theory

11

we may assume that f0 contains a (bosonic) state  that has the property that its
vertex operator v (, z) is the identity operator; in terms of the amplitudes this means
that

hv (, z)

v (i, zi)i = h

v (i, zi)i .

(23)

nyi=1

nyi=1

we call  the vacuum (state) of the theory. given , the state   f0 that is associated
to the vertex operator v (, z) can then be dened as

 = v (, 0) .

(24)

in conventional quantum eld theory, the states of the theory transform in a
suitable way under the poincare group, and the amplitudes are therefore covariant under
poincare transformations. in the present context, the role of the poincare group is played
by the group of mobius transformations m, i.e. the group of (complex) automorphisms
of the riemann sphere. these are the transformations of the form

where a, b, c, d  c ,

ad  bc = 1 .

(25)

az + b
cz + d
we can associate to each element

z 7 (z) =

,

a =  a b

c d !  sl(2,c) ,

(26)

(28)

(29)

the mobius transformation (25), and since a  sl(2,c) and a  sl(2,c) dene the
same mobius transformation, the group of mobius transformations m is isomorphic
to m = sl(2,c)/z2. in the following we shall sometimes use elements of sl(2,c) to
denote the corresponding elements of m where no confusion will result.

it is convenient to introduce a set of generators for m by

el1(z) = z + ,

el0(z) = ez,

el1(z) =

1  z

,

(27)

where the rst transformation is a translation, the second is a scaling, and the
last one is usually referred to as a special conformal transformation. every mobius
transformation can be obtained as a composition of these transformations, and for
mobius transformations with d 6= 0, this can be compactly described as

they form a basis for the lie algebra sl(2,c) of sl(2,c), and satisfy the commutation
relations

[lm, ln] = (m  n)lm+n,

m, n = 0, 1 .

(31)

as in conventional quantum eld theory, the states of the meromorphic theory
form a representation of this algebra which can be decomposed into irreducible
representations. the (irreducible) representations that are relevant in physics are those
that satisfy the condition of positive energy.
in the present context, since l0 (the
operator associated to l0) can be identied with the energy operator (up to some
constant), these are those representations for which the spectrum of l0 is bounded from
below. this will follow from the cluster property of the amplitudes that will be discussed
below. in a given irreducible highest weight representation, let us denote by  the state
for which l0 takes the minimal value, h say.k using (31) we then have

l0l1 = [l0, l1] + hl1 = (h  1)l1 ,

(32)

where ln denotes the operator corresponding to ln. since  is the state with the
minimal value for l0, it follows that l1 = 0; states with the property

l1 = 0

l0 = h

(33)

are called quasiprimary, and the real number h is called the conformal weight of .
every quasiprimary state  generates a representation of sl(2,c) that consists of the
l1-descendants (of ), i.e. the states of the form ln
1 where n = 0, 1, . . .. this
innite-dimensional representation is irreducible unless h is a non-positive half-integer.
indeed,

(n  1))ln1

(34)

(35)

(36)

and thus if h is a non-positive half-integer, the state ln
1 with n = 1  2h and its l1-
descendants dene a subrepresentation. in order to obtain an irreducible representation
one has to quotient the space of l1-descendants of  by this subrepresentation; the
resulting irreducible representation is then nite-dimensional.

since the states of the theory carry a representation of the mobius group, the
amplitudes transform covariantly under mobius transformations. the transformation
rule for general states is quite complicated (we shall give an explicit formula later on), but
for quasiprimary states it can be easily described: let i, i = 1, . . . , n be n quasiprimary
states with conformal weights hi, i = 1, . . . , n, then

h

nyi=1

dzi (cid:19)hi
nyi=1(cid:18) d(zi)

h

nyi=1

v (i, zi)i =

v (i, (zi))i ,

(37)

k we shall assume here that there is only one such state;
representations.

this is always true in irreducible

conformal field theory

13

where  is a mobius transformation as in (25).

let us denote the operators that implement the mobius transformations on the
space of states by the same symbols as in (27) with ln replaced by ln. then the
transformation formulae for the vertex operators are given as

el1v (, z)el1 = v (, z + )
= xh v (, xz)
xl0 v (, z)xl0
el1v (, z)el1 = (1  z)2hv (, z/(1  z)) ,

where  is quasiprimary with conformal weight h. we also write more generally

where d is given by the same formula as in (28). in this notation we then have

 =(cid:16)(z)(cid:17)h

v(cid:16), (z)(cid:17) ,

dv (, z)d1

d = 

(38)

(39)

(40)

(41)

(42)

for all ; this is equivalent to ln = 0 for n = 0, 1. the transformation formula for the
vertex operator associated to a quasiprimary eld  is consistent with the identication
of states and elds (24) and the denition of a quasiprimary state (33): indeed, if we
apply (39) and (40) to the vacuum, use (42) and set z = 0, we obtain

xl0 = xh

and

el1 = 

(43)

which implies that l1 = 0 and l0 = h, and is thus in agreement with (33).

the mobius symmetry constrains the functional form of all amplitudes, but in the
case of the one-, two- and three-point functions it actually determines their functional
dependence completely.
if  is a quasiprimary state with conformal weight h, then
hv (, z)i is independent of z because of the translation symmetry, but it follows from
(39) that

hv (, z)i = hhv (, z)i .

(44)

the one-point function can therefore only be non-zero if h = 0. under the assumption
of the cluster property to be discussed in the next subsection, the only state with h = 0
is the vacuum,  = .

if  and  are two quasiprimary states with conformal weights h and h,

respectively, then the translation symmetry implies that

hv (, z)v (, )i = hv (, z  )v (, 0)i = f (z  ) ,

and the scaling symmetry gives

h+hf (x) = f (x) ,

so that

f (x) = cxhh ,

(45)

(46)

(47)

where c is some constant. on the other hand, the symmetry under special conformal
transformations implies that

hv (, x)v (, 0)i = (1  x)2hhv (, x/(1  x))v (, 0)i ,

(48)

conformal field theory

14

and therefore, upon comparison with (47), the amplitude can only be non-trivial if
2h = h + h, i.e. h = h. in this case the amplitude is of the form

hv (, z)v (, )i = c(z  )2h .

(49)

if the amplitude is non-trivial for  = , the locality condition implies that h  z if 
is a bosonic eld, and h  1
2 + z if  is fermionic. this is the familiar spin-statistics
theorem.

finally, if i are quasiprimary elds with conformal weights hi, i = 1, 2, 3, then

hv (1, z1)v (2, z2)v (3, z3)i =yi<j(cid:18)ai  aj
zi  zj(cid:19)hij

hv (1, a1)v (2, a2)v (3, a3)i ,

(50)

where h12 = h1 + h2  h3, etc., and ai are three distinct arbitrary constants. in deriving
(50) we have used the fact that every three points can be mapped to any other three
points by means of a mobius transformation.

3.2. the uniqueness theorem

it follows directly from (38), (42) and (24) that

v (, z) = ezl1v (, 0) = ezl1 .

(51)

if v (, z) is in addition local, i.e. if it satises (19) for every , v (, z) is uniquely
characterised by this property; this is the content of the
uniqueness theorem [11]: if u(z) is a local vertex operator that satises

then

u(z) = ezl1

u(z) = v (, z)

on a dense subspace of h0.
proof: let   f0 be arbitrary. then

(52)

(53)

u(z) = u(z)v (, 0) = ,v (, 0)u(z) = ,v (, 0)ezl1 , (54)

where we have used the locality of u(z) and (52) and , denotes the sign in (19). we
can then use (51) and the locality of v (, z) to rewrite this as

,v (, 0)ezl1 = ,v (, 0)v (, z) = v (, z)v (, 0) = v (, z) ,

(55)

and thus the action of u(z) and v (, z) agrees on the dense subspace f0.

given the uniqueness theorem, we can now deduce the transformation property of

a general vertex operator under mobius transformations

dv (, z)d1

 = v "(cid:18)d
dz(cid:19)l0

exp(cid:18) (z)

2(z)

l1(cid:19) , (z)# .

(56)

conformal field theory

15

in the special case where  is quasiprimary, exp((z)/2(z)l1) = , and (56) reduces
to (41). to prove (56), we observe that the uniqueness theorem implies that it is sucient
to evaluate the identity on the vacuum, in which case it becomes

dezl1 = e(z)l1(cz + d)2l0e c

cz+d l1 ,

where we have written  as in (25). this then follows from

  a b
c d !  1 z

0 1 ! =  a az + b
cz + d !
=  1 az+b
1 !  (cz + d)1

cz+d

0

c

0
together with the fact that m = sl(2,c)/z2.

(cz + d) !  1

cz+d 1 !

0

c

(57)

(58)

(59)

we can now also deduce the behaviour under innitesimal transformations from
(56). for example, if  is an innitesimal translation, (z) = z + , then to rst order
in , (56) becomes

v (, z) + [l1, v (, z)] = v (, z) + 

dv
dz

(, z) ,

from which we deduce that

[l1, v (, z)] =

dv
dz

(, z) .

similarly, we nd that

[l0, v (, z)] = z

d
dz

v (, z) + v (l0, z) ,

and

[l1, v (, z)] = z2 d
dz

v (, z) + 2zv (l0, z) + v (l1, z) .

(60)

(61)

(62)

(63)

if  is quasiprimary of conformal weight h, the last three equations can be compactly
written as

[ln, v (, z)] = zn(cid:26)z

d
dz

+ (n + 1)h(cid:27) v (, z)

finally, applying (61) to the vacuum we have

ezl1l1 = ezl1 dv
dz

(, 0) ,

and this implies, using the uniqueness theorem, that

for n = 0, 1.

(64)

(65)

(, z) = v (l1, z) .

dv
dz
in particular,
it follows that the correlation functions of l1-descendants of quasi-
primary states can be directly deduced from those that only involve the quasiprimary
states themselves.

conformal field theory

3.3. factorisation and the cluster property

as we have explained above, a meromorphic conformal eld theory is determined by
its space of states h0 together with the set of amplitudes that are dened for arbitrary
elements in a dense subspace f0 of h0. the amplitudes contain all relevant information
about the vertex operators;
for example the locality and mobius transformation
properties of the vertex operators follow from the corresponding properties of the
amplitudes (21), and (37).

in practice, this is however not a good way to dene a conformal eld theory,
since h0 is always innite-dimensional (unless the meromorphic conformal eld theory
consists only of the vacuum), and it is unwieldy to give the correlation functions for
arbitrary combinations of elements in an innite-dimensional (dense) subspace f0 of
h0. most (if not all) theories of interest however possess a nite-dimensional subspace
v  h0 that is not dense in h0 but that generates h0 in the sense that h0 and all its
amplitudes can be derived from those only involving states in v ; this process is called
factorisation.

the basic idea of factorisation is very simple: given the amplitudes involving states
in v , we can dene the vector space that consists of linear combinations of states of the
form

 = v (1, z1)    v (n, zn) ,

(67)

where i  v , and zi 6= zj for i 6= j. we identify two such states if their dierence
vanishes in all amplitudes (involving states in v ), and denote the resulting vector space

v (, z) = v (1, z1 + z)    v (n, zn + z) ,

(68)

a vertex operator for  by

by bf0. we then say that v generates h0 if bf0 is dense in h0. finally we can introduce
and the amplitudes involving arbitrary elements in bf0 are thus determined in terms of

those that only involve states in v . (more details of this construction can be found
in [48].) in the following, when we shall give examples of meromorphic conformal eld
theories, we shall therefore only describe the theory associated to a suitable generating
space v .

it is easy to check that the locality and mobius transformation properties of the
amplitudes involving only states in v are sucient to guarantee the corresponding

properties for the amplitudes involving arbitrary states in bf0, and therefore for the

conformal eld theory that is obtained by factorisation from v . however, the situation
is more complicated with respect to the condition that the states in h0 are of positive
energy, i.e. that the spectrum of l0 is bounded from below, since this clearly does
not follow from the condition that this is so for the states in v .
in the case of the
meromorphic theory the relevant spectrum condition is actually slightly stronger in
that it requires that the spectrum of l0 is non-negative, and that there exists a unique
state, the vacuum, with l0 = 0. this stronger condition (which we shall always assume
from now on) is satised for the meromorphic theory obtained by factorisation from v

conformal field theory

17

provided the amplitudes in v satisfy the cluster property; this states that if we separate
the variables of an amplitude into two sets and scale one set towards a xed point (e.g.
0 or ) the behaviour of the amplitude is dominated by the product of two amplitudes,
corresponding to the two sets of variables, multiplied by an appropriate power of the
separation, specically

*yi

v (i, i)yj

v (j, zj)+ *yi

v (i, i)+*yj

v (j, zj)+ hj

where i, j  v have conformal weight h
i and hj, respectively. (here  means that
the two sides of the equation agree up to terms of lower order in .) because of the
mobius covariance of the amplitudes this is equivalent to

as   0 ,(69)

v (j, zj)+ *yi

v (i, i)+*yj

v (j, zj)+ h

i

as    .

to prove that this implies that the spectrum of l0 is non-negative and that the

vacuum is unique, let us introduce the projection operators dened by

*yi

v (i, i)yj
pn =i0

ul0n 1du,

for n  z/2 ,

where we have absorbed a factor of 1/2i into the denition of the symbol h .

particular, we have

pnyj

v (j, zj) =i du uhn 1yj

v (j, uzj)  ,

where h =pj hj. it then follows that the pn are projection operators

pn pm = 0, if n 6= m,

pn = 1

p 2

n = pn , xn

(70)

in

(71)

(72)

(73)

(75)

onto the eigenspaces of l0,

l0pn = npn .

for n  0, we then have

*yi

v (i, i)pnyj

v (j, zj)+ = i0
 *yi
v (j, zj) = *yj

uhjn 1*yi
v (i, i)+*yj
v (j, zj)+ ,

p0yj

v (j, uzj)+ du

v (i, i)yj
v (j, zj)+i|u|=

un 1du (74)

which, by taking   0, is seen to vanish for n < 0 and, for n = 0, to give

and so p0 =  hi. thus the cluster decomposition property implies that pn = 0 for
n < 0, i.e. that the spectrum of l0 is non-negative, and that  is the unique state with
l0 = 0. the cluster property also implies that the space of states can be completely
decomposed into irreducible representations of the lie algebra sl(2,c) that corresponds
to the mobius transformations (see appendix d of [48]).

conformal field theory

3.4. the operator product expansion

18

one of the most important consequences of the uniqueness theorem is that it allows
for a direct derivation of the duality relation which in turn gives rise to the operator
product expansion.
duality theorem [11]: let  and  be states in f0, then

(76)

v (, z)v (, ) = v(cid:16)v (, z  ), (cid:17) .

proof: by the uniqueness theorem it is sucient to evaluate both sides on the vacuum,
in which case (76) becomes

v (, z)v (, ) = v (, z)el1

where we have used (38).

= el1v (, z  )

= v(cid:16)v (, z  ), (cid:17) ,

(77)

(78)

(79)

for many purposes it is convenient to expand the elds v (, z) in terms of modes

vn()znh ,

(80)

v (, z) = xnzh

where  has conformal weight h, i.e. l0 = h. the modes can be dened in terms of
a contour integral as

vn() =i zh+n1v (, z)dz ,

where the contour encircles z = 0 anticlockwise.
v (, 0) =  implies that

in terms of the modes the identity

(81)

vh() = 

and

vl() = 0 for l > h.

furthermore, if  is quasiprimary, (64) becomes

[lm, vn()] = (m(h  1)  n) vm+n()

m = 0, 1.

(82)

(83)

actually, the equations for m = 0, 1 do not require that  is quasiprimary as follows
from (61) and (62); thus we have that [l0, vn()] = nvn() for all , so that vn()
lowers the eigenvalue of l0 by n.

given the modes of the conformal elds, we can introduce the fock space ef0 that

is spanned by eigenstates of l0 and that forms a dense subspace of the space of states.
this space consists of nite linear combinations of vectors of the form

 = vn1(1)vn2(2)    vnn (n ) ,

(84)

where ni + hi  z, hi is the conformal weight of i, and we may restrict i to be in the
subspace v that generates the whole theory by factorisation. because of (83)  is an
eigenvector of l0 with eigenvalue

l0 = h

where h = pn

i=1 ni.

(85)

conformal field theory

19

we can also introduce a vertex operator for  by the formula

states of the form (84); the subspace by which w0 has to be divided consists of linear
combinations of states of the form (84) that vanish in all amplitudes.

the fock space ef0 is a quotient space of the vector space w0 whose basis is given by the
v (, z) =ic1
where the cj are contours about 0 with |zi| > |zj| if i < j. the fock space ef0 thus

satises the conditions that we have required of the dense subspace f0, and we may
therefore assume that f0 is actually the fock space of the theory; from now on we shall
always do so.

v (n , z + zn )dzn ,

(86)

the duality property of the vertex operators can now be rewritten in terms of

modes as

v (, z)v (, ) = v (v (, z  ), )

= xnh

v (vn(), )(z  )nh ,

(87)

where l0 = h and l0 = h, and ,   f0. the sum over n is bounded by h,
since l0vn() = (h  n)vn(), and the spectrum condition implies that the theory
does not contain any states of negative conformal weight. the equation (87) is known
as the operator product expansion. the innite sum converges provided that all other
meromorphic elds in a given amplitude are further away from  than z.

we can use (87) to derive a formula for the commutation relations of modes as

follows. the commutator of two modes vm() and vn() is given as

[vm(), vn()] =i dzi d
i dzi d

|z|>||

||>|z|

zm+h1 n+h1v (, z)v (, )

zm+h1 n+h1v (, z)v (, )

(88)

where the contours on the right-hand side encircle the origin anti-clockwise. we can
then deform the two contours so as to rewrite (88) as

v (vl(), )(z  )lh ,

(89)

[vm(), vn()] =i0

 n+h1d i

zm+h1dz xl
hxn =h+1  m + h  1

where the z contour is a small positive circle about  and the  contour is a positive
circle about the origin. only terms with l  1  h contribute, and the integral becomes

[vm(), vn()] =

m  n ! vm+n(vn ()) .

(90)

in particular, if m  h + 1, n  h + 1, then m  n  0 in the sum, and
m + n  n + n  n  h + 1. this implies that the modes {vm() : m  h + 1}

 to be precise, the following construction a priori only denes a lie bracket for the quotient space of
modes where we identify modes whose action on the fock space of the meromorphic theory coincides.

conformal field theory

20

close as a lie algebra. the same also holds for the modes {vm() : m  h  1}, and
therefore for their intersection

l0 = {vn() : h + 1  n  h  1} .

(91)

this algebra is sometimes called the vacuum-preserving algebra since any element in l0
annihilates the vacuum. a certain deformation of l0 denes a nite lie algebra that can
be interpreted as describing the nite w -symmetry of the conformal eld theory [49].
it is also clear that the subset of all positive, all negative or all zero modes form closed
lie algebras, respectively.

3.5. the inner product and null-vectors

we can dene an (hermitian) inner product on the fock space f0 provided that the
amplitudes are hermitian in the following sense: there exists an antilinear involution
 7  for each   f0 such that the amplitudes satisfy

if this condition is satised, we can dene an inner product by

v (i, zi)i .

 h

exp(cid:20)

z

l1(cid:21) ,

z! v (, z)+ .

this inner product is hermitian, i.e.

h, i = h, i

since (92) implies that the left-hand-side of (94) is

z0*v  (cid:18)

and the covariance under the mobius transformation (z) = 1/z then implies that this

since  7  is an involution, we can choose a basis of real states, i.e. states that satisfy
 = . if  is a quasiprimary real state, then (97) simplies to

conformal field theory

21

where h denotes the conformal weight of . in this case the adjoint of the mode vn()
is

(vn()) = i dzzh+n1(cid:18)

z2(cid:19)h
= (1)hi d  hn+1v (, )

= (1)hvn() .

1

v (, 1/z)

(100)

by a similar calculation it also follows that the adjoint of the mobius generators are
given as

l

1 = l1

l

0 = l0 .

(101)

all known conformal eld theories satisfy (92) and thus possess a hermitian inner
product; from now on we shall therefore sometimes assume that the theory has such an
inner product.

the inner product can be extended to the vector space w0 whose basis is given by
the states of the form (84). typically, the inner product is degenerate on w0, i.e. there
exist vectors n  w0 for which

h, n i = 0

for all   w0.

(102)

every vector with this property is called a null-vector. because of mobius covariance, the
eld corresponding to n vanishes in all amplitudes, and therefore n is in the subspace
by which w0 has to be divided in order to obtain the fock space f0. since this is the
case for every null-vector of w0, it follows that the inner product is non-degenerate on
f0.

in general, the inner product may not be positive denite, but there exist many
interesting theories for which it is; in this case the theory is called unitary. for unitary
theories, the spectrum of l0 is always bounded by 0. to see this we observe that if  is
a quasiprimary state with conformal weight h, then

hl1, l1i = h, l1l1i

= 2hh, i ,

(103)

where we have used (101). if the theory is unitary then both sides of (103) have to be
non-negative, and thus h  0.

3.6. conformal structure

up to now we have described what could be called meromorphic eld theory rather
than meromorphic conformal eld theory (and that is, in the mathematical literature,
sometimes referred to as a vertex algebra, rather than a vertex operator algebra). indeed,
we have not yet discussed the conformal symmetry of the correlation functions but only
its mobius symmetry. a large part of the structure that we shall discuss in these notes
does not actually rely on the presence of a conformal structure, but more advanced

conformal field theory

22

features of the theory do, and therefore the conformal structure is an integral part of
the theory.

a meromorphic eld theory is called conformal if the three mobius generators l0,
l1 are the modes of a eld l that is then usually called the stress-energy tensor or
the virasoro eld. because of (31), (83) and (90), the eld in question must be a
quasiprimary eld of conformal weight 2 that can be expanded as

(104)

if we write l(z) = v (l, z), the commutator in (90) becomes

l(z) =

[lm, ln] =

lnzn2 .

xn=
2xn =1  m + 1

m(m2  1)

=

mn ! vm+n (ln l)

vm+n(l2l) +

6

m(m + 1)

2

vm+n(l1l)

+ (m + 1)vm+n(l0l) + vm+n(l1l) .

(105)

all these expressions can be evaluated further [11]+: since l2l has conformal weight
h = 0, the uniqueness of the vacuum implies that it must be proportional to the vacuum
vector,

l2l = l2l2 =

c
2

 ,

(106)

where c is some constant. also, since the vacuum vector acts as the identity operator,
vn() = n,0. furthermore, l1l = 0 since l is quasiprimary, and l0l = 2l since l
has conformal weight 2. finally, because of (66),

v (l1, z) =

(n + h)vn()zn(h+1) ,

(107)

d

dzxn

vn()znh = xn

and since l1 has conformal weight h + 1 (if  has conformal weight h),

vn(l1) = (n + h)vn() .

putting all of this together we then nd that (105) becomes

[lm, ln] = (m  n)lm+n +

c
12

m(m2  1)m+n,0 .

(108)

(109)

this algebra is called the virasoro algebra [53], and the parameter c is called the central
charge. the real algebra dened by (109) is the lie algebra of the central extension of
the group of dieomorphisms of the circle (see e.g. [54]).

if the theory contains a virasoro eld, the states transform in representations of
the virasoro algebra (rather than just the lie algebra of sl(2,c) that corresponds to
the mobius transformations). under suitable conditions (for example if the theory
is unitary), the space of states can then be completely decomposed into irreducible
representations of the virasoro algebra. because of the spectrum condition, the relevant

+ this is also known as the luscher-mack theorem, see [5052].

conformal field theory

23

representations are then highest weight representations that are generated from a
primary state , i.e. a state satisfying

l0 = h

ln = 0 for n > 0.

if  is primary, the commutation relation (83) holds for all m, i.e.

[lm, vn()] = (m(h  1)  n)vm+n()

for all m  z

(110)

(111)

as follows from (90) together with (108). in this case the conformal symmetry also leads
to an extension of the mobius transformation formula (41) to arbitrary holomorphic
transformations f that are only locally dened,

df v (, z)d1

f = (f (z))h v (, f (z)) ,

(112)

where  is primary and df is a certain product of exponentials of ln with coecients
that depend on f [55]. the extension of (112) to states that are not primary is also
known (but again much more complicated).

3.7. examples

let us now give a number of examples that exhibit the structures that we have described
so far.

3.7.1. the free boson the simplest conformal eld theory is the theory that is
associated to a single free boson. in this case v can be taken to be a one-dimensional
vector space, spanned by a vector j of weight 1, in which case we write j(z)  v (j, z).
the amplitude of an odd number of j-elds is dened to vanish, and in the case of an
even number it is given by

hj(z1)    j(z2n)i =

kn

nyj=1
2nn! xs2n
nyj=1
= kn xs 

2n

1

(z(j)  z(j+n))2 ,

1

(z(j)  z(j+n))2 ,

(113)

(114)

where k is an arbitrary (real) constant and, in (113), s2n is the permutation group on
2n objects, whilst, in (114), the sum is restricted to the subset s
2n of permutations
  s2n such that (i) < (i + n) and (i) < (j) if 1  i < j  n. it is clear that
these amplitudes are meromorphic and local, and it is easy to check that they satisfy
the condition of mobius invariance with the conformal weight of j being 1.

from the amplitudes we can directly read o the operator product expansion of

the eld j with itself as

j(z)j() 

k

(z  )2 ,

(115)

where we use the symbol  to indicate equality up to terms that are non-singular at
z = . comparing this with (87), and using (90) we then obtain

[jn, jm] = nkn,m .

(116)

conformal field theory

24

this denes (a representation of) the ane algebra u(1). j is also sometimes called a
u(1)-current. the operator product expansion (115) actually contains all the relevant
information about the theory since one can reconstruct the amplitudes from it; to this
end one denes recursively

and

h i

= 1

hj(z)i = 0

*j(z)

nyi=1

j(i)+ =

nxj=1

k

(z  i)2 * nyi=1

i6=j

(117)

(118)

(119)

j(i)+ .

indeed, the two sets of amplitudes have the same poles, and their dierence describes
therefore an entire function; all entire functions on the sphere are constant and it is not
dicult to see that the constant is actually zero. the equality between the two sets of
amplitudes can also be checked directly.

this theory is actually conformal since the space of states that is obtained by

factorisation from these amplitudes contains the state

l =

1
2k

j1j1 ,

(120)

which plays the role of the stress-energy tensor with central charge c = 1. the
corresponding eld (that is dened by (86)) can actually be given directly as

v (l, z) = l(z) =

1
2k



 j(z)j(z) 

 ,

(121)



 denotes normal ordering, which, in this context, means that the singular part

where 
of the ope of j with itself has been subtracted. in fact, it follows from (87) that



j(w)j(z) =

1

(w  z)2 v (j1j1, z) +

(w  z)
+ v (j1j1, z) + o(w  z) ,

v (j0j1, z)

(122)

(123)

1

and therefore (121) implies (120).

3.7.2. ane theories we can generalise this example to the case of an arbitrary nite-
dimensional lie algebra g; the corresponding conformal eld theory is usually called a
wess-zumino-novikov-witten model [5660], and the following explicit construction
suppose that the matrices ta,
of the amplitudes is due to frenkel & zhu [61].
ctc,
1  a  dim g, provide a nite-dimensional representation of g so that [ta, tb] = f ab
where f ab
c are the structure constants of g. we introduce a eld j a(z) for each ta,
1  a  dim g. if k is any matrix which commutes with all the ta, dene

a1a2...am = tr(kta1ta2    tam) .

the a1a2...am have the properties that

a1a2a3...am1am = a2a3...am1ama1

(124)

(125)

conformal field theory

and

a1a2a3...am1am  a2a1a3...am1am = f a1a2

bba3...am1am .

25

(126)

with a cycle  = (i1, i2, . . . , im)  (i2, . . . , im, i1) we associate the function

ai1 ai2 ...aim
f


(zi1, zi2, . . . , zim) =

ai1 ai2 ...aim

(zi1  zi2)(zi2  zi3)    (zim1  zim)(zim  zi1)

.

(127)

if the permutation   sn has no xed points, it can be written as the product of cycles
of length at least 2,  = 12 . . . m . we associate to  the product f of functions
f1f2 . . . fm and dene hj a1(z1)j a2(z2) . . . j an(zn)i to be the sum of such functions f
over permutations   sn with no xed point. graphically, we can construct these
amplitudes by summing over all graphs with n vertices where the vertices carry labels
aj, 1  j  n, and each vertex is connected by two directed lines (propagators) to other
vertices, one of the lines at each vertex pointing towards it and one away. (in the above
notation, the vertex i is connected to 1(i) and to (i), and the line from 1(i) is
directed towards i, and from i to (i).) thus, in a given graph, the vertices are divided
into directed loops or cycles, each loop containing at least two vertices. to each loop, we
associate a function as in (127) and to each graph we associate the product of functions
associated to the loops of which it is composed.

the resulting amplitudes are evidently local and meromorphic, and one can verify
that they satisfy the mobius covariance property with the weight of j a being 1. they
determine the operator product expansion to be of the form

j a(z)j b(w) 

ab

(z  w)2 +

f ab
cj c(w)
(z  w)

,

and the algebra therefore becomes

[j a

m, j b

n] = f ab

cj c

m+n + mabm,n .

(128)

(129)

this is (a representation of) the ane algebra g [6264]. in the particular case where g
is simple, ab = tr(ktatb) = kab in a suitable basis, where k is a real number (that is
called the level). the algebra then becomes

[j a

m, j b

n] = f ab

cj c

m+n + mkabm,n .

again this theory is conformal since it has a stress-energy tensor given by

(130)

(131)

l =

j a
1j a

1 ,

1

2(k + q)xa

where q is the dual coxeter number of g (i.e. the value of the quadratic casimir in
the adjoint representation divided by the length squared of the longest root). here the
central charge is

c =

2k dim g
2k + q

,

(132)

 the terms singular in (z  w) only arise from cycles where the vertices associated to z and w are
adjacent. the rst term in (128) comes from the 2-cycle involving z and w. for every larger cycle
in which z and w are adjacent, there exists another cycle where the order of z and w is reversed; the
contributions of these two cycles combine to give the second term in (128).

conformal field theory

and the corresponding eld can be described as

l(z) =



 j a(z)j a(z) 
 .

finally, the modes of l can be expressed in terms of the modes of j a as

ln =

: j a

mj a

nm : ,

1

1

2(k + q)xa
2(k + q)xa xm
l :=( j a

where the colons denote normal ordering

: j a

mj b

mj b
if m < 0
l
j b
l j a
m if m  0.

26

(133)

(134)

(135)

the construction of the stress-energy-tensor as a bilinear in the currents j a is called
the sugawara construction [65]. the construction can be generalised directly to the case
where g is semi-simple: in this case, the sugawara eld is the sum of the sugawara elds
associated to each simple factor, and the central charge is the sum of the corresponding
central charges.

the conformal eld theory associated to the ane algebra g is unitary if k is a

positive integer [54, 66]; in this case c  1.

3.7.3. virasoro theories another very simple example of a meromorphic conformal
eld theory is the theory where v can be taken to be a one-dimensional vector space
that is spanned by the (conformal) vector l [4]. let us denote the corresponding eld by
l(z) = v (l, z). again following frenkel and zhu [61], we can construct the amplitudes
graphically as follows. we sum over all graphs with n vertices, where the vertices are
labelled by the integers 1  j  n, and each vertex is connected by two directed lines
(propagators) to other vertices, one of the lines at each vertex pointing towards it and
one away. in a given graph, the vertices are now divided into loops, each loop containing
at least two vertices. to each loop  = (i1, i2, . . . , im), we associate a function

f(zi1, zi2, . . . , zim) =

(zi1  zi2)2(zi2  zi3)2    (zim1  zim)2(zim  zi1)2 ,

c/2

(136)

where c is a real number, and, to a graph, the product of the functions associated to its
loops. [since it corresponds to a factor of the form (zizj)2 rather than (zizj)1, each
line or propagator might appropriately be represented by a double line.] the amplitudes
hl(z1)l(z2) . . . l(zn)i are then obtained by summing the functions associated with the
various graphs with n vertices. [note that graphs related by reversing the direction of
any loop contribute equally to this sum.]

these amplitudes determine the operator product expansion to be

l(z)l() 

c/2

(z  )4 +

2l()
(z  )2 +

l()
z  

,

(137)

which thus agrees with the operator product expansion of the eld l as dened in
subsection 3.6.

conformal field theory

27

these pure virasoro models are unitary if either c  1 or c belongs to the unitary

discrete series [67]

c = 1 

6

m(m + 1)

m = 2, 3, 4, . . .

(138)

the necessity of this condition was established in [67] using the kac-determinant
formula [68] that was proven by feigin & fuchs in [69]. the existence of these unitary
representations follows from the coset construction (to be explained below) [70].

3.7.4. lattice theories let us recall that a lattice  is a subset of an n-dimensional
inner product space which has integral coordinates in some basis, ej, j = 1, . . . , n; thus

 = {p mjej : mj  z}. the lattice is called euclidean if the inner product is positive

denite, i.e. if k2  0 for each k  , and integral if k  l  z for all k, l  . an
(integral) lattice is even if k2 is an even integer for every k  .

suppose  is an even euclidean lattice with basis ej, j = 1, . . . , n. let us
j = 1 and
for k = m1e1 + m2e2 + . . . + mnen,

introduce an algebra consisting of matrices j, 1  j  n, such that 2
ij = (1)eiej ji. if we dene k = m1
we can dene quantities (k1, k2, . . . , kn ), taking the values 1, by

1 m2

2

. . . mn

n

k1k2 . . . kn = (k1, k2, . . . , kn )k1+k2+...+kn .

(139)

we dene the theory associated to the lattice  by taking a basis for v to consist of
the states k  . for each k, the corresponding eld v (k, z) has conformal weight 1
2k2,
and the amplitudes are given by

if k1 + k2 + . . . + kn = 0 and zero otherwise. the (k1, k2, . . . , kn ) obey the conditions

(k1, k2, . . . , kj1, kj, kj+1, kj+2, . . . , kn )

= (1)kjkj+1(k1, k2, . . . , kj1, kj+1, kj, kj+2, . . . , kn ) ,

which guarantees the locality of the amplitudes, and

(k1, k2, . . . , kj)(kj+1, . . . , kn )

(141)

(142)

(143)

= (k1 + k2 + . . . + kj, kj+1 + . . . + kn )(k1, k2, . . . , kj, kj+1, . . . , kn ) ,

(144)

which implies the cluster decomposition property (that guarantees the uniqueness of
the vacuum). it is also easy to check that the amplitudes satisfy the mobius covariance
condition.

this theory is also conformal, but the virasoro eld cannot be easily described in
terms of the elds in v . in fact, the theory that is obtained by factorisation from the
above amplitudes contains n elds of conformal weight 1, h i(z), i = 1, . . . , n, whose
operator product expansion is

h i(z)h j()  ij

1

(z  )2 .

(145)

hv (k1, z1)v (k2, z2)    v (kn , zn)i = (k1, k2, . . . , kn ) y1i<jn

(zi  zj)kikj

(140)

conformal field theory

this is of the same form as (115), and the corresponding modes therefore satisfy

[h i

m, h j

n] = mijm,n .

the virasoro eld is then given as

l(z) =



 h i(z)h i(z) 
 ,

1

2xi

and the central charge is c = n. details of the construction of this unitary meromorphic
conformal eld theory can be found in [71, 72].

for the case where  is the root lattice of a simply-laced nite-dimensional lie
algebra, the lattice theory coincides with the ane theory of the corresponding ane
lie algebra at level k = 1; this is known as the frenkel-kac-segal construction [73,74].

lattice theories that are associated to even self-dual lattices whose dimension is a
multiple of 24 provide examples of local meromorphic conformal eld theories, i.e. local
modular invariant theories that are meromorphic. such theories are characterised by the
property that all amplitudes depend only on the chiral coordinates (i.e. on zi but not
on zi), and that the space of states of the complete local theory coincides with (rather
than just contains) that of the meromorphic (sub)theory. recall that for a given lattice
, the dual lattice  is the lattice that contains all vectors y for which x  y  z for all
x  . a lattice is integral if   , and it is self-dual if  = . the dimension of an
even self-dual lattice has to be a multiple of 8.

it is not dicult to prove that a basis of states for the meromorphic fock space f
that is associated to an even lattice  can be taken to consist of the states of the form

h i1

m1h i2

m2    h in

mn |ki ,

(148)

where m1  m2      mn , ij  {1, . . . , n} and k  . here h i
l are the modes of the
currents (145), and |ki = v (k, 0). the contribution of the meromorphic subtheory to
the partition function (11) is therefore

f( ) = q c

24 trf(ql0) = ( ) dim ( ) ,

where ( ) is the famous dedekind eta-function,

28

(146)

(147)

(149)

(150)

(151)

 is the theta function of the lattice,

(1  qn) ,

24

( ) = q

yn=1
( ) =xk

q

1

2 k2

,

and we have set q = e2i . the theta function of a lattice is related to that of its dual
by the jacobi transformation formula

(1/ ) = (i )

1

2 dim ||||( ) ,

(152)

where |||| = | det(ei  ej)|. together with the transformation formula of the dedekind
function

(1/ ) = (i )

1

2 ( ) ,

(153)

conformal field theory

29

this implies that the partition function of the meromorphic theory transforms under
modular transformations as

f(1/ ) = ||||f ( ) .

(154)

furthermore, it follows from (149) together with the fact that the spectrum of l0 in f
is integral that

f( + 1) = e2i c

24 f( ) .

(155)

if  is a self-dual lattice, |||| = 1 and the partition function is invariant under
the transformation in (154). if in addition c = n = 24k where k  z, the partition
function of the meromorphic theory is invariant under the whole modular group, and
the meromorphic theory denes a local (modular invariant) conformal eld theory. for
the case where n = 24, lattices with these properties have been classied: there exist
precisely 24 such lattices, the 23 niemeier lattices and the leech lattice (see [75] for
a review). the leech lattice plays a central role in the construction of the monster
conformal eld theory [14].

3.7.5. more general w -algebras in the above examples, closed formulae for all
amplitudes of the generating elds could be given explicitly. there exist however many
meromorphic conformal eld theories for which this is not the case. these theories
are normally dened in terms of the operator product expansion of a set of generating
elds (that span v ) from which the commutation relations of the corresponding modes
can be derived; the resulting algebra is then usually called a w -algebra. in general, a
w -algebra is not a lie algebra in the modes of the generating elds since the operator
product expansion (and therefore the associated commutator) of two generating elds
may involve normal ordered products of the generating elds rather than just the
generating elds themselves.

in principle all amplitudes can be determined from the knowledge of these
commutation relations, but it is often dicult to give closed expressions for them. (it
is also, a priori, not clear whether the power series expansion that can be obtained
from these commutation relations will converge to dene meromorphic functions with
the appropriate singularity structure, although this is believed to be the case for all
presently known examples.) the theories that we have described in detail above are in
some sense fundamental in that all presently known meromorphic (bosonic) conformal
eld theories have an (alternative) description as a coset or orbifold of one of these
theories; these constructions will be described in the next subsection.

the rst example of a w -algebra that is not a lie algebra in the modes of its
generating elds is the so-called w3 algebra [76, 77]; this algebra is generated by the
virasoro algebra {ln}, and the modes wm of a quasiprimary eld of conformal weight
h = 3, subject to (109) and the relations [7678]

[lm, wn] = (2m  n) wm+n ,

where k are the modes of a quasiprimary eld of conformal weight h = 4. this eld
is a normal ordered product of l with itself, and its modes are explicitly given as

(157)

one can check that this set of commutators satises the jacobi-identity.
(this is
believed to be equivalent to the associativity of the operator product expansion of
the corresponding elds.)
subsequently, various classes of w -algebras have been
constructed [7986]. there have also been attempts to construct systematically classes
of w -algebras [87, 88] following [89]. for a review of these matters see [90].

3.7.6. superconformal field theories all examples mentioned up to now have been
bosonic theories, i.e. theories all of whose elds are bosonic (and therefore have integral
conformal weight). the simplest example of a fermionic conformal eld theory is the
theory generated by a single free fermion eld b(z) of conformal weight h = 1
2 with

satisfy an anti-commutation relation of the form

{br, bs} = r,s .

the virasoro eld is given in this case by

l(z) =

db(z)

and the corresponding modes are

(160)

(161)

(162)

they satisfy the virasoro algebra with central charge c = 1
2 .

this theory has a supersymmetric extension whose generating elds are the free
fermion b(z) (158) and the free boson j(z) dened by (115) and (116), where we set
for convenience k = 1. the operator product expansion of j and b is regular, so
that the corresponding commutator vanishes. this theory then exhibits superconformal
invariance; in the present context this means that the theory has in addition to the

conformal field theory

31

stress-energy-tensor l, the superpartner eld g of conformal weight 3/2, whose modes
satisfy

[lm, gr] = (cid:16) m

4(cid:19) r,s .

together with the virasoro commutation relations for l (109), this is called the (neveu
schwarz [ns] sector of the) n = 1 superconformal algebra. in terms of j and b, l and
g can be written as

l(z) =

 j(z)j(z)

b(z) 



g(z) = j(z)b(z) ,

(164)

where on the right-hand-side of the second line we have omitted the normal ordering
since the operator product expansion is regular. the modes of l and g are then given
as

: jnmjm : +

2(cid:19) : bnrbr :

and it is easy to check that they satisfy (109) and (163) with c = 3/2.

the n = 1 superconformal eld theory that is generated by the elds l and g

subject to the commutation relations (163) is unitary if [91]

m = 2, 3, 4, . . .

(166)

there also exist extended superconformal algebras that contain the above algebra as
a subalgebra. the most important of these is the n = 2 superconformal algebra [92, 93]
that is the symmetry algebra of the world-sheet conformal eld theory of space-time
supersymmetric string theories [94]. in the so-called ns sector, this algebra is generated
by the modes of the virasoro algebra (109), the modes of a free boson jn (116) (where
we set again k = 1), and the modes of two supercurrents of conformal dimension h = 3

the representation theory of the n = 2 superconformal algebra exhibits many

conformal field theory

3.8. the coset construction

32

there exists a fairly general construction by means of which a meromorphic conformal
eld theory can be associated to a pair of a meromorphic conformal eld theory and a
subtheory. in its simplest formulation [70,98] (see also [99101] for a related construction
in a particular case) the pair of theories are ane theories that are associated to a pair
m and lh
h  g of nite-dimensional simple lie algebras. let us denote by lg
m the modes
of the sugawara elds (134) of the ane algebras g and h, respectively.
n is a
generator of h  g, then

if j a

[lg

m, j a

n] = nj a

m+n

and

[lh

m, j a

n] = nj a

m+n

(168)

n are the modes of a primary eld of conformal weight h = 1. (this can also be

since j a
checked directly using (134) and (130).) it then follows that

km = lg

m  lh
m

(169)

commutes with every generator j a
bilinear in j a

n). we can thus write lg

n of h, and therefore with the modes lh
m as the sum of two commuting terms

m (which are

m = lh
lg

m + km ,

(170)

and since both lg
follows that this is also the case for km, where the corresponding central charge is

m satisfy the commutation relations of a virasoro algebra, it

m and lh

ck = cg  ch .

(171)

it is also straightforward to extend the construction to the case where g (and/or h) are
semi-simple.

in the unitary case, both cg  ch  1, but ck need not be greater or equal to one.
indeed, we can consider g = su(2)m  su(2)1 and h = su(2)m+1, where the index is the
level k of (130), and the central charge ck is then

ck =

3m

m + 2

+ 1 

3(m + 1)
(m + 3)

= 1 

6

(m + 2)(m + 3)

,

(172)

where m  z+ and we have used (132) together with dim su(2) = 3 and qsu(2) = 4. by
construction, the subspace that is generated by km from the vacuum forms a unitary
representation of the virasoro algebra with h = 0 and c = ck, and thus for each value of
c in the unitary discrete series (138), the vacuum representation of the virasoro algebra
is indeed unitary [70]. similar arguments can also be given for the discrete series of the
n = 1 superconformal algebra (166) [98].

we can generalise this construction directly to the case where instead of the ane
theory associated to g, we consider an arbitrary conformal eld theory h (with stress-
energy tensor l) that contains, as a subtheory, the ane theory associated to h. then
by the same arguments as above

k = l  lh

(173)

hh =n  h : j a

n  h with n  0o

n = 0 for every j a

(174)

conformal field theory

33

commutes with h (and thus with lh), and therefore satises a virasoro algebra with
central charge ck = cch. by construction, the virasoro algebra km leaves the subspace
of states

invariant. furthermore, the operator product expansion of an h-current j a(z) and a
vertex operator v (, ) associated to   hh is regular, and therefore the corresponding
modes commute. this implies that the operator product expansion of two states in hh
only contain states that lie in hh [102], and thus that we can dene a meromorphic
eld theory whose space of states is hh. since the commutator of lh with any state
in hh vanishes, it is clear that the virasoro eld for this theory is k; the resulting
meromorphic conformal eld theory is called the coset theory.

many w -algebras can be constructed as cosets of ane theories [81, 102104].
it is also possible to construct representations of the coset theory from those of h,
and to determine the corresponding modular transformation matrix; details of these
constructions for the case of certain coset theories of ane theories have been recently
worked out in [105].

3.9. orbifolds

there exists another very important construction that associates to a given local
(modular invariant) conformal eld theory another such theory [106110]. this
construction is possible whenever the theory carries an action of a nite group g. a
group g acts on the space of states of a conformal eld theory hhh, if each g  g denes
a linear map g : hhh  hhh (that leaves the dense subspace fff invariant, g : fff  fff), the
composition of maps respects the group structure of g, and the amplitudes satisfy

hv (g1; z1, z1)    v (gn; zn, zn)i = hv (1; z1, z1)    v (n; zn, zn)i . (175)

the space of states of the orbifold theory consists of those states that are invariant
under the action of g,

hhhg = {  hhh : g =  for all g  g.} ,

(176)

together with additional twisted sectors, one for each conjugacy class in g. generically
the meromorphic subtheory of the resulting theory consists of those meromorphic elds
of the original theory that are invariant under g, but in general it may also happen that
some of the twisted sectors contain additional meromorphic elds.

the construction of the twisted sectors is somewhat formal in general, and so is the
proof that the resulting local theory is always modular invariant. there exist however
some examples where the construction is understood in detail, most notably the local
meromorphic lattice theories that were discussed in section 3.7.4. let us for simplicity
consider the case where g = z2 = {1, }, and the action on h is determined by

h i(z) = h i(z) ,

v (x, z) = v (x, z) ,

 =  .

(177)

conformal field theory

34

in this case there exists only one twisted sector, h
r, i = 1, . . . , n with r  z + 1
ci

2, satisfying the commutation relations

, and it is generated by the operators

[ci

r, cj

s] = rijr,s .

these act on an irreducible representation space u of the algebra

ij = (1)eiej ji ,

(178)

(179)

where ei, i = 1, . . . , n is a basis of , and where for   u, ci
r = 0 if r > 0. the actual
orbifold theory consists then of the states in the untwisted h and the twisted sector
h
 that are left invariant by , where the action of  on h is given as in (177), and
on h

 we have

ci

r = ci
r

|u = 1 .

the generators of the virasoro algebra act in the twisted sector as

lm =

1
2

nxi=1 xrz+ 1

2

: ci

rci

mr : +

n
16

m,0 .

(180)

(181)

as in the untwisted sector lm commutes with  and is therefore well dened in the
orbifold theory.

since the local meromorphic conformal eld theory is already modular invariant,
the dimension n of the lattice is a multiple of 24 and the orbifold theory is again a
meromorphic conformal eld theory. this theory is again bosonic provided the sign in
(180) corresponds to the parity of dim  divided by 8. with this choice of (180) the
orbifold theory denes another local meromorphic conformal eld theory [71, 72, 111].

the most important example of this type is the orbifold theory associated to the
leech lattice for which the orbifold theory does not have any states of conformal weight
one. this is the famous monster conformal eld theory whose automorphism group is the
monster group [1214, 112], the largest simple sporadic group. it has been conjectured
that this theory is uniquely characterised by the property to be a local meromorphic
conformal eld theory with c = 24 and without any states of conformal weight one [14],
but this has not been proven so far.

one can also apply the construction systematically to the other 23 niemeier
lattices. together with the 24 local meromorphic conformal eld theories that are
directly associated to the 24 self-dual lattices, this would naively give 48 conformal eld
theories. however, nine of these theories coincide, and therefore these constructions
only produce 39 dierent local meromorphic conformal eld theories [72, 111]. if the
above conjecture about the uniqueness of the monster theory is true, then every local
meromorphic conformal eld theory at c = 24 (other than the monster theory) contains
states of weight one, and therefore an ane subtheory [11]. the theory can then
be analysed in terms of this subtheory, and using arguments of modular invariance,
schellekens has suggested that at most 71 local meromorphic conformal eld theories
exist for c = 24 [39]. however this classication has only been done on the level of the
partition functions, and it is not clear whether more than one conformal eld theory

conformal field theory

35

may correspond to a given partition function. also, none of these additional theories
has been constructed explicitly, and it is not obvious that all 71 partition functions arise
from consistent conformal eld theories.

4. representations of a meromorphic conformal field theory

for most local conformal eld theories the meromorphic elds form a proper subspace of
the space of states. the additional states of the theory transform then in representations
of the meromorphic (and the anti-meromorphic) subtheory. indeed, as we explained in
section 2.1, the space of states is a direct sum of subspaces hhh(j,), each of which forms
an indecomposable representation of the two meromorphic conformal eld theories. for
most conformal eld theories of interest (although not for all, see [41]), each hhh(j,) is
a tensor product of an irreducible representation of the meromorphic and the anti-
meromorphic conformal subtheory, respectively

hhh(j,) = hj  h .

(182)

the local theory is specied in terms of the space of states and the set of all amplitudes
involving arbitrary states in fff  hhh. the meromorphic subtheory that we analysed
above describes the amplitudes that only involve states in f0. similarly, the anti-
meromorphic subtheory describes the amplitudes that only involve states in f 0. since
the two meromorphic theories commute, a general amplitude involving states from
both f0 and f 0 is simply the product of the corresponding meromorphic and anti-
meromorphic amplitude.
(indeed, the product of the meromorphic and the anti-
meromorphic amplitude has the same poles as the original amplitude.)

if the theory factorises as in (182), one of the summands in (8) is the completion
of f0  f 0, and we denote it by hhh(0,0). a general amplitude of the theory contains
states from dierent sectors hhh(j,). since each hhh(j,) is a representation of the two
vertex operator algebras, we can use the operator product expansion (5) to rewrite
a given amplitude in terms of amplitudes that do not involve states in hhh(0,0).
it is
therefore useful to call an amplitude an n-point function if it involves n states from
sectors other than hhh(0,0) and an arbitrary number of states from hhh(0,0).
in general,
each such amplitude can be expressed as a sum of products of a chiral amplitude, i.e.
an amplitude that only depends on the zi, and an anti-chiral amplitude, i.e. one that
only depends on the zi. however, for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, the sum contains only one term
since the functional form of the relevant chiral (and anti-chiral) amplitudes is uniquely
determined by mobius symmetry.

the zero-point functions are simply products of meromorphic amplitudes, and
the one-point functions vanish. the two-point functions are usually non-trivial, and
they dene, in essence, the dierent representations of the meromorphic and the anti-
meromorphic subtheory that are present in the theory. since these amplitudes factorise
into chiral and anti-chiral amplitudes, one can analyse them separately; these chiral
amplitudes dene then a representation of the meromorphic subtheory.

conformal field theory

4.1. highest weight representations

36

a representation of the meromorphic conformal eld theory is dened by the collection
of amplitudes

d (w)v (1, z1)    v (n, zn)(u)e ,

where  and  are two xed elds (that describe the generating eld of a representation
and its conjugate), and i are quasiprimary elds in the meromorphic conformal eld
theory. the amplitudes (183) are analytic functions of the variables and transform
covariantly under the mobius transformations as in (37)

(183)

(184)

d (w)v (1, z1)    v (n, zn)(u)e
dw (cid:19)h(cid:18) d(u)
d ((w))v (1, (z1))    v (n, (zn))((u))e ,

du (cid:19)h nyi=1(cid:18) d(zi)
dzi (cid:19)hi

=(cid:18) d(w)

where hi is the conformal weight of i, and we call h and h the conformal weights of 
and , respectively. since  and  are not meromorphic elds, h and h are in general
not half-integer, and the amplitudes are typically branched about u = w. because of the
mobius symmetry we can always map the two points u and w to 0 and , respectively
(for example by considering the mobius transformation (z) = zu
zw ), and we shall from
now always do so. in this case we shall write (0)i = |i. for the case of w =  the
situation is slightly more subtle since (183) behaves as w2h for w  ; we therefore
dene

h | = lim
w

w2hh (w) .

(185)

we can then think of the amplitudes as being the expectation value of the meromorphic
elds in the background described by  and .

the main property that distinguishes the amplitudes as representations of the
meromorphic conformal eld theory is the condition that the operator product relations
of the meromorphic conformal eld theory are preserved by these amplitudes. this is
the requirement that the operator product expansion of the meromorphic elds (87)
also holds in the amplitudes (183), i.e.
h |v (1, z1)    v (i, zi)v (i+1, zi+1)    v (n, zn)|i

(zi  zi+1)nhi

(186)

= xn<hi+1

h |v (1, z1)    v (i1, zi1)v (vn(i)i+1, zi+1)    v (n, zn)|i ,

where |zi  zi+1| < |zj  zi+1| for j 6= i and |zi  zi+1| < |zi+1|. in writing (186) we
have also implicitly assumed that if n is a null-state of the meromorphic conformal
eld theory (i.e. a linear combination of states of the form (84) that vanishes in every
meromorphic amplitude) then any amplitude (183) involving n also vanishes; this is

conformal field theory

37

implicit in the above since the operator product expansion of the meromorphic conformal
eld theory is only determined up to such null-elds by the meromorphic amplitudes.

we call a representation untwisted if the amplitudes (183) are single-valued as zi
encircles the origin or innity; if this is not the case for at least some of the meromorphic
elds the representation is called twisted.
if the representation is untwisted, we can
expand the meromorphic elds in terms of their modes as in (80). in this way we can
then dene the action of vn() on the non-meromorphic state |i, and thus on arbitrary
states of the form

vn1(1)    vnn (n )|i .

(187)

as we explained in section 3.4, the commutation relations of these modes (90) can be
derived from the operator product expansion of the corresponding elds. since the
representation amplitudes (183) preserve these in the sense of (186), it follows that the
action of the modes on the states of the form (187) also respects (90), at least up to
null-states that vanish in all amplitudes. if we thus dene the fock space f to be the
quotient space of the space of states generated by (187), where we identify states whose
dierence vanishes in all amplitudes, then f carries a representation of the lie algebra
of modes (of the meromorphic elds).

for most of the following we shall only consider untwisted representations, but
there is one important case of a twisted representations, the so-called ramond sector
of a fermionic algebra, that should be mentioned here since it can be analysed by very
similar methods. in this case the bosonic elds are single-valued as z encircles the origin,
and the fermionic elds pick up a minus sign. it is then again possible to expand the
meromorphic elds in modes, where the bosonic elds are treated as before, and for a
fermionic eld we now have

vr()zrh

r-sector of fermionic .

(188)

v (, z) =xrz

using the same methods as before, we can deduce the commutation (and anti-
commutation) relations of these modes from the operator product expansion of the
elds in the meromorphic conformal eld theory, and the fock space of the r-sector
representations forms then a representation of this lie algebra.
indeed, the actual
form of the commutation and anti-commutation relations is the same except that the
fermionic elds now have integer mode number. for example, the commutation relations
of the r-sector of the n = 1 superconformal algebra are

[lm, ln] = (m  n)lm+n +

m(m2  1)m,n

c
12

[lm, gr] = (cid:16) m

2

{gr, gs} = 2lr+s +

 r(cid:17) gm+r
3(cid:18)r2 

c

1

4(cid:19) r,s ,

(189)

 strictly speaking, the underlying vector space of this lie algebra is the vector space of modes, where
we identify two modes if their dierence vanishes on the fock space of all representations.

conformal field theory

38

where now r, s  z, and this agrees formally with (163).

the physically relevant representations satisfy again the condition that the
spectrum of l0 (the zero mode of the conformal stress-energy-tensor) is bounded from
below. this implies that there exists a state 0 in f that is annihilated by all modes
vn() with n > 0 (since vn() lowers the l0 eigenvalue by n as follows from (83)); such
a state is called a (virasoro) highest weight state. if the representation is irreducible, i.e.
if it does not contain any proper subrepresentations, then the representation generated
from 0 by the action of the modes reproduces the whole representation space, and
we may therefore assume that  (and ) are highest weight states. using the mode
expansion of the meromorphic eld v (, z), the highest weight property of  can be
rewritten as the condition that the pole in z of an amplitude involving v (, z)|i is at
most of order h, where h is the conformal weight of . because of the mobius covariance
of the amplitudes, this is then also equivalent to the condition that the order of the pole
in (zi  u) in (183) is bounded by the conformal weight of i, hi.

if 0 is a virasoro highest weight state, then so is v0()0 for any . the space
of virasoro highest weight states therefore forms a representation of the zero modes of
the meromorphic elds. conversely, given a representation r of the zero modes we can
consider the space of states that is generated from a state in r by the action of the
negative modes; this is called the verma module. more precisely, the verma module v
is the vector space that is spanned by the states of the form

vn1(1)    vnn (n )

  r ,

where ni < 0, modulo the relations

(190)

(191)

vl1(1)    vlr (r)(cid:16)vn()vm()  vm()vn()(cid:17)vlr+1(r+1)    vln (n )
= vl1(1)    vlr (r)hvn(), vm()ivlr+1(r+1)    vln (n ) ,

where   r, and [vn(), vm()] stands for the right-hand-side of (90). if the meromor-
phic conformal eld theory is generated by a nite set of elds, w 1(z), . . . w s(z), one can
show [104] that the verma module is spanned by the so-called poincare-birkho-witt
basis that consists of vectors of the form

w i1

m1    w il

ml ,

(192)

where   r, mj > 0, 1  ij+1  ij  s and mj  mj+1 if ij = ij+1. the actual fock
space of the representation f is again a certain quotient of the verma module, where
we set to zero all states that vanish identically in all amplitudes; these states are again
called null-vectors.

4.2. an illustrative example

it should be stressed at this stage that the condition to be a representation of
the meromorphic conformal eld theory is usually stronger than that of being a
representation of the lie algebra (or w-algebra) of modes of the generating elds. for
example, in the case of the ane theories introduced in section 3.7.2, the latter condition

conformal field theory

39

means that the representation space has to be a representation of the ane algebra (130),
and for any value of k, there exist innitely many (non-integral) representations. on the
other hand, if k is a positive integer, the meromorphic theory possesses null-vectors, and
only those representations of the ane algebra are representations of the meromorphic
conformal eld theory for which the null-elds act trivially on the representation space;
this selects a nite number of representations. for example, if g = su(2), the ane
algebra can be written (in the cartan-weyl basis) as [66]

1
2

kmm,n

[hm, hn] =
[hm, j 
[j +
m, j 

n ] = j 
n ] = 2hm+n + kmm,n ,

m+n

(193)

(194)

and if k is a positive integer, the vector

n =(cid:0)j +

1(cid:1)k+1



is a singular vector, i.e. it is a descendant of the highest weight vector that is annihilated
by all modes vn() with n > 0. this follows from the fact that the positive modes of
the generating elds annihilate n which is obvious for hnn = j +
n n
is a consequence of lnn = 0 for n > 0 together with

n n = 0, and for j 

j 
1 n =

1 , j +

1](j +

1)kl

(j +

1)l[j 

kxl=0
="k(k + 1)  2

kxl=0

(k  l)# (j +

1)k = 0 .

(195)

every singular vector is a null-vector as follows from (100). in the above example, n
actually generates the null-space in the sense that every null-vector of the meromorphic
conformal eld theory can be obtained by the action of the modes from n [113] (see
also [64]).

the zero modes of the ane algebra su(2) form the nite lie algebra of su(2). for
every (nite-dimensional) representation r of su(2), i.e. for every spin j  z/2, we can
construct a verma module for su(2) whose virasoro highest weight space transforms
as r. this (and any irreducible quotient space thereof) denes a representation of the
ane algebra su(2). on the other hand, the zero mode of the null-vector n acts on any
virasoro highest weight state  as

(196)

v0(n ) =(cid:0)j +

0(cid:1)k+1  ,

and in order for the verma module to dene a representation of the meromorphic
conformal eld theory, (196) must vanish. this implies that j can only take the values
j = 0, 1/2, . . . , k/2. since n generates all other null-elds [61], one may suspect that
this is the only additional condition, and this is indeed correct.

incidentally, in the case at hand the meromorphic theory is actually unitary, and
the allowed representations are precisely those representations of the ane algebra that
are unitary with respect to an inner product for which

(hm) = hm .

(197)

= (k  2j)(cid:16)|j, ji, |j, ji(cid:17) ,

1 j +

(198)

and if the representation is unitary, this requires that (k  2j)  0, and thus that
j = 0, 1/2, . . . , k/2. as it turns out, this is also sucient to guarantee unitarity. in
general, however, the constraints that select the representations of the meromorphic
conformal eld theory from those of the lie algebra of modes cannot be understood in
terms of unitarity.

4.3. zhus algebra and the classication of representations

the above analysis suggests that to each representation of the zero modes of the
meromorphic elds for which the zero modes of the null-elds vanish, a highest weight
representation of the meromorphic conformal eld theory can be associated, and that all
highest weight representations of a meromorphic conformal eld theory can be obtained
in this way [114]. this idea has been made precise by zhu [16] who constructed an
algebra, now commonly referred to as zhus algebra, that describes the algebra of zero
modes modulo zero modes of null-vectors, and whose representations are in one-to-one
correspondence with those of the meromorphic conformal eld theory. the following
explanation of zhus work follows closely [48].

in a rst step we determine the subspace of states whose zero modes always vanish
on virasoro highest weight states. this subspace certainly contains the states of the
form (l1 + l0), where   f0 is arbitrary, since (108) implies that

v0 ((l1 + l0)) = v0 (l1) + hv0 () = 0 .

(199)

furthermore, the subspace must also contain every state whose zero mode is of the form
v0()v0((l1 + l0)) or v0((l1 + l0))v0(). in order to describe states of this form
more explicitly, it is useful to observe that if both  and  are virasoro highest weight
states

conformal field theory

40

indeed, if |j, ji is a virasoro highest weight state with j +
then

0 |j, ji = 0 and h0|j, ji = j|j, ji,

h |v (, 1)|i =xl

h |vl()|i

= h |v0()|i ,

(200)

since the highest weight property implies that vl()|i = 0 for l > 0 and similarly, using
(100), h |vl() = 0 for l < 0. because of the translation symmetry of the amplitudes,
this can then be rewritten as

h |(1) i = h |v0()|i .

let us introduce the operators

v (n )() =i0

dw

wn +1 v (cid:16)(w + 1)l0 , w(cid:17) ,

(201)

(202)

conformal field theory

41

where n is an arbitrary integer, and the contour is a small circle that encircles w = 0
but not w = 1. then if both  and  are arbitrary virasoro highest weight states and
n > 0, we have that

h |(1) v (n )()i = 0 ,

(203)

since the integrand in (203) does not have any poles at w = 1 or w = . because of
(201) this implies that the zero mode of the corresponding state vanishes on an arbitrary
highest weight state (since the amplitude with any other highest weight state vanishes).
let us denote by o(f0) the subspace of f0 that is generated by states of the form
v (n )() with n > 0, and dene the quotient space a(f0) = f0/o(f0). the above
then implies that we can associate a zero mode (acting on a highest weight state) to
each state in a(f0). we can write (202) in terms of modes as

v (n )() =

hxn=0(cid:18)h

n(cid:19)vnn () ,

where  has conformal weight h, and it therefore follows that

v (1)() = vh1() + hvh() = (l1 + l0) .

thus o(f0) contains the states in (199). furthermore,

v (n )(l1) =i0
= i0

dw

dw

wn +1 (w + 1)h+1 dv (, w)

dw

d

dw(cid:18) (w + 1)h+1

wn +1

(cid:19) v (, w)

= (n  h)v (n )() + (n + 1)v (n +1)() ,

and this implies, for n 6= 1,

v (n +1)() =

1

n + 1

v (n )(l1) 

n  h
n + 1

v (n )() .

(204)

(205)

(206)

(207)

thus o(f0) is actually generated by the states of the form v (1)(), where  and 
are arbitrary states in f0.

as we shall show momentarily, the vector space a(f0) actually has the structure

of an associative algebra, where the product is dened by

 l   v (0)() ,

(208)

and v (0)() is given as in (202) or (204); this algebra is called zhus algebra. the
analogue of (203) is then

h |(1) v (0)()i = (1)hhv0() |(1) i
= (1)hhv0() |v0()|i
= h |v0()v0()|i ,

(209)

(210)

and thus the product in a(f0) corresponds indeed to the action of the zero modes.

conformal field theory

42

in order to exhibit the structure of this algebra it is useful to introduce a second

set of modes by

v (n )
c

() = (1)ni dw

w

1

(w + 1)(cid:18) w + 1
w (cid:19)n

v (cid:0)(w + 1)l0, w(cid:1) .

these modes are characterised by the property that

h |(1) v (n )
h |(1) v (0)

c

c

() i = 0
() i = h | (v0()) (1) i .

for n > 0,

(211)

(212)

(213)

it is obvious from (204) and (211) that v (1)() = v (1)

(), and the analogue of (207) is

v (n +1)
c

() = 

1

n + 1

v (n )
c

(l1) 

c
n + h
n + 1

v (n )
c

() .

(214)

the space o(f0) is therefore also generated by the states of the form v (1)
introduce, following (209) and (213), the notation

c

(). let us

vl()  v (0)()

vr()  v (0)

c

()

n() = v (1)() = v (1)

c

() .

we also denote by n(f0) the vector space of operators that are spanned by n() for
  f0; then o(f0) = n(f0)f0. finally it follows from (82) that vl() = vr() =
.

the equations (209) and (213) suggest that the modes vl() and vr() commute
up to an operator in n(f0). in order to prove this it is sucient to consider the case
where  and  are both eigenvectors of l0 with eigenvalues h and h, respectively.
then we have

[vl(), vr()] = i i||>|w|

( + 1)h

(w + 1)h1

because of (214), every element in n(f0) can be written as vr() for a suitable , and
(215) thus implies that [vl(), n()]  n(f0); hence vl() denes an endomorphism
of a(f0).

(215)

conformal field theory

43

for two endomorphisms, 1, 2, of f0, which leave o(f0) invariant (so that they
induce endomorphisms of a(f0)), we shall write 1  2 if they agree as endomorphisms
of a(f0), i.e. if (1  2)f0  o(f0). similarly we write   0 if   o(f0).

in the same way in which the action of v (, z) is uniquely characterised by locality

and (51), we can now prove the following
uniqueness theorem for zhu modes [48]: suppose  is an endomorphism of f0
that leaves o(f0) invariant and satises

 = 

[, vr()]  n(f0)

for all   f0.

then   vl().
proof: this follows from

  =  vr()  vr()   = vr() = vr() vl()   vl() ,

where we have used that vl() = vr() = .

it is then an immediate consequence that

vl(vl())  vl()vl() ,

(216)

and a particular case of this (using again the fact that every element in n(f0) can be
written as vl() for some suitable ) is that

vl(n())  n()vl() .

(217)

in particular this implies that the product (208)  l  is well-dened for both
,   a(f0). furthermore, (216) shows that this product is associative, and thus
a(f0) has the structure of an algebra.

we can also dene a product by  r  = vr(). since

 l  = vl() = vl()vr()  vr()vl() = vr() =  r 

this denes the reverse ring (or algebra) structure.

as we have explained before, this algebra plays the role of the algebra of zero
modes. since it has been constructed in terms of the space of states of the meromorphic
theory, all null-relations have been taken into account, and one may therefore expect
that its irreducible representations are in one-to-one correspondence with the irreducible
representation of the meromorphic conformal eld theory. this is indeed true [16],
although the proof is rather non-trivial.

4.4. finite (or rational) theories

since zhus algebra plays a central role in characterising the structure of a conformal
eld theory, one may expect that the theories for which it is nite-dimensional are
particularly simple and tractable. in the physics literature these theories are sometimes
called rational [115], although it may seem more appropriate to call them nite, and

conformal field theory

44

we shall from now on do so. the name rational originates from the observation that
the conformal weights of all states as well as the central charge are rational numbers in
these theories [116,117]. unfortunately, there is no uniform denition of rationality, and
indeed, the notion is used somewhat dierently in mathematics and physics; a survey
of the most common denitions is given in the appendix. in this paper we shall adopt
the convention that a theory is called nite if zhus algebra is nite-dimensional, and
it is called rational if it satises the conditions of zhus denition together with the c2
criterion (see the appendix).

the determination of zhus algebra is usually rather dicult since the modes n()
that generate the space o(f0) are not homogeneous with respect to l0.
it would
therefore be interesting to nd an equivalent condition for the niteness of a conformal
eld theory that is easier to analyse in practice. one such condition that implies (and
may be equivalent to) the niteness of a meromorphic conformal eld theory is the
so-called c2 condition of zhu [16]: this is the condition that the quotient space

a(1)(f0) = h/o(1)(f0)

(218)

is nite-dimensional, where o(1)(f0) is spanned by the states of the form vl()
where l  h, the conformal weight of .
it is not dicult to show that the
dimension of zhus algebra is bounded by that of the above quotient space [16], i.e.
dim(a(f0))  dim(a(1)(f0)). in many cases the two dimensions are actually the same,
but this is not true in general; the simplest counter example is the theory associated to
the ane algebra for g = e8 at level k = 1. as we have mentioned before, this theory can
equivalently be described as the meromorphic conformal eld theory that is associated
to the self-dual root lattice of e8, and it is well known that its only representation is the
meromorphic conformal eld theory itself [118]; the highest weight space of the vacuum
representation is one-dimensional, and zhus algebra is therefore also one-dimensional.
on the other hand, it is clear that the dimension of a(1)(f0) is at least 249 since the
vacuum state and the 248 vectors of the form j a
1 (where a runs over a basis of the
248-dimensional adjoint representation of e8) are linearly independent in a(1)(f0).

many examples of nite conformal eld theories are known. of the examples we
mentioned in section 3.7, the theories associated to even euclidean lattices (3.7.4) are
always nite (and unitary) [118, 119], the ane theories (3.7.2) are nite if the level k
is a positive integer [5961] (in which case the theory is also unitary), and the virasoro
models (3.7.3) are nite if they belong to the so-called minimal series [4, 120]. this is
the case provided the central charge c is of the form

cp,q = 1 

6(p  q)2

pq

,

(219)

where p, q  2 are coprime integers. in this case there exist only nitely many irreducible
representations of the meromorphic conformal eld theory. each such representation is

 incidentally, a(1)(f0) also has the structure of an abelian algebra; the signicance of this algebra is
however not clear at present.

conformal field theory

45

the irreducible quotient space of a verma module generated from a highest weight state
with conformal weight h, and the allowed values for h are

h(r,s) =

(rp  qs)2  (p  q)2

4pq

,

(220)

where 1  r  q  1 and 1  s  p  1, and (r, s) denes the same value as (q  r, p  s).
each of the corresponding verma modules has two null-vectors at conformal weights
h+rs and h+(pr)(q s), respectively, and the actual fock space is the quotient space
of the verma module by the subspace generated by these two null-vectors [68, 69, 121].
there are therefore (p  1)(q  1)/2 inequivalent irreducible highest weight

representations, and zhus algebra has dimension (p  1)(q  1)/2, and is of the form

(221)

c[t]/y(r,s)

(t  h(r,s)) .

in this case the dimension of zhus algebra actually agrees with the dimension of the
homogeneous quotient space (218). indeed, we can choose a basis for (218) to consist
of the states of the form ll
2, where l = 0, 1, . . .. for c = cp,q the meromorphic verma
module has a null-vector at level (p  1)(q  1) (since it corresponds to r = s = 1), and
since the coecient of l(p1)(q1)/2
 in the null-vector does not vanish [120122], this
allows us to express l(p1)(q1)/2
 in terms of states in o(1)(f0), and thus shows that
the dimension of a(1)(f0) is indeed (p  1)(q  1)/2.

2

2

the minimal models include the unitary discrete series (138) for which we choose
p = m and q = m + 1, but they also include non-unitary nite theories. the theory
with (p, q) = (2, 3) is trivial since c = 0, and the simplest (non-trivial) unitary theory is
the so called ising model for which (p, q) = (3, 4) [4]: this is the theory with c = 1
2 , and
its allowed representations have conformal weight

h = 0 (vacuum)

h =

1
2

(energy)

h =

1
16

(spin) .

(222)

the simplest non-unitary nite theory is the yang-lee edge theory with (p, q) = (2, 5)
[123] for which c =  22
5 . this theory has only two allowed representations, the vacuum
representation with h = 0, and the representation with h = 1/5. it has also been
observed that the theory with (p, q) = (4, 5) can be identied with the tricritical ising
model [124].

5. fusion rules, correlation functions and verlindes formula

upto now we have analysed in detail the meromorphic subtheory and its representa-
tions, i.e. the zero- and two-point functions of the theory. in order to understand the
structure of the theory further we need to analyse next the amplitudes that involve more
than two non-trivial representations of the meromorphic subtheory. in a rst step we
shall consider the three-point functions that describe the allowed couplings between the
dierent subspaces of hhh. we shall then also consider higher correlation functions; their
structure is in essence already determined in terms of the three-point functions.

conformal field theory

46

5.1. fusion rules and the comultiplication formula

as we have explained before, the three-point amplitudes factorise into chiral and anti-
chiral functions. we can therefore restrict ourselves to discussing the corresponding
chiral amplitudes of the meromorphic theory, say. their functional form is uniquely
determined, and one of the essential pieces of information is therefore whether the
corresponding amplitudes can be non-trivial or not; this is encoded in the so-called
fusion rules.

the denition of the fusion rule is actually slightly more complicated since there
can also be non-trivial multiplicities. in fact, the problem is rather analogous to that of
decomposing a tensor product representation (of a compact group, say) into irreducibles.
because of the mobius covariance of the amplitudes, it is sucient to consider the
amplitudes of the form

hk() v (1, z1)    v (l, zl) i(u1)j(u2)i ,

(223)

where the three non-meromorphic elds are i, j and k, and we could set u1 = 1 and
u2 = 0, for example. the amplitude denes, in essence, an action of the meromorphic
elds on the product i(u1)j(u2), and the amplitude can only be non-trivial if this
product representation contains the representation that is conjugate to k. furthermore,
if this representation is contained a nite number of times in the product representation
i(u1)j(u2), there is a nite ambiguity in dening the amplitude. we therefore dene,
more precisely, the fusion rule n k
ij to be the multiplicity with which the representation
conjugate to k appears in i(u1)j(u2).

the action of the meromorphic elds (or rather their modes) on the product of
the two elds can actually be described rather explicitly using the comultiplication
formula [40, 125, 126]: let us denote by a the algebra of modes of the meromorphic
elds. a comultiplication is a homomorphism

 : a  a  a ,

vn() 7x (1)(vn())  (2)(vn()) ,

and it denes an action on the product of two elds as

vn()(cid:16)i(u1)j(u2)(cid:17) =x(cid:0)(1)(vn())i(cid:1) (u1)(cid:0)(2)(vn())j(cid:1) (u2) .

here the action of the modes of the meromorphic elds on i or j is dened as in (187).
the comultiplication depends on u1 and u2, and for the modes of a eld  of conformal
weight h, it is explicitly given as

(224)

(225)

u1,u2(vn()) =

nxm=1h  n + h  1

m + h  1 ! unm
nxl=1h  n + h  1

l + h  1 ! unl

+ 1

(vm()  1l)

1

(1l  vl())

(226)

2

 an alternative (more mathematical) denition of this tensor product was developed by huang &
lepowsky [127130].

conformal field theory

u1,u2(vn()) =

xm=1h  n + m  1

hand vector in the tensor product and the meromorphic eld  are both fermionic or
not. (in (226, 227) m and l are in z  h.) this formula holds in every amplitude, i.e.

*yj

v (j, j)vn()(cid:16)i(u1)j(u2)(cid:17)+

=x*yj

v (j, j)(cid:0)(1)(vn())i(cid:1) (u1)(cid:0)(2)(vn())j(cid:1) (u2)+ ,

(228)

where each j can be a meromorphic or a non-meromorphic eld and we have used the
notation of (225). in fact, the comultiplication formula can be derived from (228) using

the fact that the amplitude hqj v (j, j)v (, z)i(u1)j(u2)i from which the above

expression can be obtained by integration has only poles (as a function of z) for z = j
and z = ui [125, 126].

the above formula is not symmetric under the exchange of i and j. in fact, it is
manifest from the derivation that (228) must also hold if the comultiplication formulae
(226) and (227) are replaced by

for n  h. since the two formulae agree in every amplitude, the product space is
therefore the ring-like tensor product, i.e. the quotient of the direct product by the

once a convention has been chosen for one element, the fermion number of any element that can be

denition [126, 131], and the results coincide with those obtained by other methods.
indeed, fusion rules were rst determined, for the case of the minimal models, by
considering the implications for the amplitudes of the dierential equations that follow
from the condition that a null-vector of a representation must vanish in all amplitudes [4]:
if the central charge c is given in terms of (p, q) as in (219), the highest weight
representations are labelled by (r, s), where h is dened by (220) and 1  r  q  1 and
1  s  p  1; the fusion rules are then given as

(r1, s1)  (r2, s2)

min(r1+r21,2q1r1r2)

mr=|r1r2|+1

min(s1+s21,2p1s1s2)

ms=|s1s2|+1

(r, s) , (231)

where r and s attain only every other value, i.e. r (s) is even if r1 + r2  1 (s1 + s2  1)
is even, and odd otherwise.

the analysis of [4] was adapted for the wess-zumino-novikov-witten models in [60].
for a general ane algebra g, the fusion rules can be determined from the so-called depth
rule; in the specic case of g = su(2) at level k, this leads to

j1  j2 =

min(j1+j2,kj1j2)mj=|j1j2|

j ,

(232)

where j is integer if j1 + j2 is integer, and half-integer otherwise, and the highest weight
representations are labelled by j = 0, 1/2, . . . , k/2. a closed expression for the fusion
rules in the general case is provided by the kac-walton formula [64, 132, 133].

similarly, the fusion rules have been determined for the w3 algebra in [134], the
n = 1 superconformal minimal models in [135] and the n = 2 superconformal minimal
models in [136, 137]. for nite theories the fusion rules can also be obtained by
performing the analogue of zhus construction in each representation space; this was rst
done (in a slightly dierent language) by feigin & fuchs for the minimal models [138],
and later by frenkel & zhu for general vertex operator algebras [61]. (as was pointed
out by li [139], the analysis of frenkel & zhu only holds under additional assumptions,
for example in the rational case.)

one of the advantages of the approach that we have adopted here is the fact
that structural properties of fusion can be derived in this framework [140]. for each
representation hj, let us dene the subspace f 
j of the fock space fj to be the space
that is spanned by the vectors of the form

vn()

where   fj and n  h().

we call a representation quasi-rational provided that the quotient space

fj/f 
j

(233)

(234)

is nite-dimensional. this quotient space (or rather a realisation of it as a subspace of
fj) is usually called the special subspace.

it was shown by nahm [140] that the fusion product of a quasi-rational represen-
tation and a highest weight representation contains only nitely many highest weight

conformal field theory

49

representations. he also showed that the special subspace of the fusion product of
two quasi-rational representations is nite-dimensional. in fact, if we denote by ds
j the
dimension of the special subspace, we have

(235)

in particular, these results imply that the set of quasi-rational representations of a
meromorphic conformal eld theory is closed under the operation of taking fusion
products.
it is believed that every representation of a nite meromorphic conformal
eld theory is quasi-rational [140], but quasi-rationality is a weaker condition and there
also exist quasi-rational representations of meromorphic theories that are not nite. the
simplest example is the virasoro theory for which c is given by (219), but p and q are not
(coprime) integers greater than one. this theory is not nite, but every highest weight
representation with h = hr,s as in (220) and r, s positive integers is quasi-rational. (this
is a consequence of the fact that such a representation has a null-vector with conformal
weight h + rs, whose coecient of lrs
1 is non-zero.) in fact, the collection of all of these
representations is closed under fusion, and forms a quasi-rational chiral conformal eld
theory.

5.2. indecomposable fusion products and logarithmic theories

in much of the above discussion we have implicitly assumed that the fusion product of
any two irreducible representations of the chiral conformal eld theory can be completely
decomposed into irreducible representations. whilst this is indeed correct for most
theories of interest, there exist a few models where this is not the case. these theories
are usually called logarithmic theories since, as we shall explain, some of their correlation
functions contain logarithms. in this subsection we shall give a brief account of this class
of theories; since the general theory has only been developed for theories for which this
problem is absent, the present subsection is something of an interlude and not crucial
for the rest of this article.

the simplest example of a logarithmic theory is the (quasi-rational) virasoro model
with p = 2, q = 1 whose conformal charge is c = 2 [141]. as we have explained before,
the quasi-rational (irreducible) representations of this theory have a highest weight
vector with conformal weight h = hr,s (220), where r and s are positive integers. since
the formula for hr,s has the symmetry (for p = 2, q = 1)

hr,s = h1r,2s = hr1,s2 ,

(236)

we can restrict ourselves to the values (r, s) with s = 1, 2.

the vacuum representation is (r, s) = (1, 1) with conformal weight h = 0; the null-
vector at level rs = 1 is l1. the simplest non-trivial representation is (r, s) = (1, 2)
with h = 1/8; it has a null-vector at level rs = 2. as we have alluded to before, a
null-vector of a representation gives rise to a dierential equation for the corresponding

conformal field theory

50

amplitude [4].
conformal weight h = 1/8, the 4-point function involving four times  has the form

in the present case, if we denote by  the highest weight state with

h(z1)(z2)(z3)(z4)i = (z1  z3)

1

4 (z2  z4)

1

4 (x(1  x))

1

4 f (x) ,

(237)

where we have used the mobius symmetry, and x denotes the cross-ratio

x =

(z1  z2)(z3  z4)
(z1  z3)(z2  z4)

.

(238)

the null-vector for  gives then rise to a dierential equation for f which, in the present
case, is given by

(239)

(240)

x(1  x)f (x) + (1  2x)f (x) 

1
4

f (x) = 0 .

we can make an ansatz for f as

f (x) = xs(cid:0)a0 + a1x + a2x2 +   (cid:1) ,

where a0 6= 0. the dierential equation (239) then determines the ai recursively provided
we can solve the indicial equation, i.e. the equation that comes from the coecient of
xs1,

s(s  1) + s = s2 = 0 .

(241)

generically, the indicial equation has two distinct roots (that do not dier by an integer),
and for each solution of the indicial equation there is a solution of the original dierential
equation that is of the form (240). however, if the two roots coincide (as in our case),
only one solution of the dierential equation is of the form (240), and the general solution
to (239) is

f (x) = ag(x) + b [g(x) log(x) + h(x)] ,

(242)

where g and h are regular at x = 0 (since s = 0 solves (241)), and a and b are
constants. in fact,

and

g(x) =z 

0

2

d

p1  x sin2 

,

g(x) log(x) + h(x) = g(1  x) .

(243)

(244)

this implies that the 4-point function necessarily has a logarithmic branch cut: if f is
regular at x = 0, i.e. if we choose b = 0, then because of (244), f has a logarithmic
branch cut at x = 1.

in terms of the representation theory this logarithmic behaviour is related to the
property of the fusion product of  with itself not to be completely reducible: by
considering a suitable limit of z1, z2   in the above 4-point function we can obtain
a state  satisfying

d() (z)(0)e = z

1

4(cid:16)a + b log(z)(cid:17) ,

(245)

conformal field theory

where a and b are constants (that depend now on ). we can therefore write

(z)(0)  z

1

4(cid:16)(0) + log(z)(0)(cid:17) ,

where h()(0)i = a and h()(0)i = b. next we consider the transformation of
this amplitude under a rotation by 2; this is implemented by the mobius transformation
exp(2il0),

d() e2il0(cid:16)(z)(0)(cid:17)e = e 2i

1

= z

4 d() (e2iz)(0)e
4(cid:16)a + b log(z) + 2ib(cid:17) ,
4d() e2il0(cid:16)(0) + log(z)(0)(cid:17)e .

1

d() e2il0(cid:16)(z)(0)(cid:17)e = z

comparing (247) with (248) we then nd that

where we have used that the transformation property of vertex operators (39) also holds
for non-meromorphic elds. on the other hand, because of (246) we can rewrite

51

(246)

(247)

(248)

(249)

(250)

(251)

e2il0 = 
e2il0 =  + 2i ,

0 0 !
  0 1

i.e. l0 = 0, l0 = . thus we nd that the scaling operator l0 is not diagonalisable,
but that it acts as a jordan block

on the space spanned by  and . since l0 is diagonalisable in every irreducible
representation, it follows that the fusion product is necessarily not completely decompo-
sable. this conclusion holds actually more generally whenever any correlation function
contains a logarithm.

one can analyse the fusion product of  with itself using the comultiplication
formula, and this allows one to determine the structure of the resulting representation
r1,1 in detail [142]: the representation is generated from a highest weight state 
satisfying

l0 =  ,

l0 = 0 ,

ln = 0

for n > 0

(252)

by the action of the virasoro algebra. the state l1 is a null-state of r1,1, but l1
is not null since l1l1 = [l1, l1] = 2l0 = 2. schematically the representation
can therefore be described as

r1,1

here each vertex  denotes a state of the representation space, and the vertices 
correspond to null-vectors. an arrow a  b indicates that the vertex b is in the
image of a under the action of the virasoro algebra. the representation r1,1 is not
irreducible since the states that are obtained by the action of the virasoro algebra from
 form the subrepresentation h0 of r1,1 (that is actually isomorphic to the vacuum
representation). on the other hand, r1,1 is not completely reducible since we cannot
nd a complementary subspace to h0 that is a representation by itself; r1,1 is therefore
called an indecomposable (but reducible) representation.

actually, r1,1

is the simplest example of a whole class of

indecomposable
representations that appear in fusion products of the irreducible quasi-rational represen-
tations; these indecomposable representations are labelled by (m, n) where now n = 1,
and their structure is schematically described as

the representation rm,n is generated from the vector m,n by the action of the virasoro
algebra, where

l0m,n = h(m,n)m,n + m,n ,
l0m,n = h(m,n)m,n ,
lkm,n = 0

for k  2 .

where m,n is a virasoro highest weight vector of conformal weight h = h(m1,2n). the

(257)

(258)

and this vector is proportional to m,n; this singular vector is however not a null-vector in
rm,n since it does not vanish in an amplitude with m,n. it was shown in [142] that the

conformal field theory

53

set of representations that consists of all quasi-rational irreducible representations and
the above indecomposable representations closes under fusion, i.e. any fusion product
of two such representations can be decomposed as a direct sum of these representations.
this model is not an isolated example; the same structure is also present for the
virasoro models with q = 1 where p is any positive integer [142]. furthermore, the
wznw model on the supergroup gl(1, 1) [143] and gravitationally dressed conformal
eld theories [144,145] are also known to dene logarithmic theories. it was conjectured
by dong & mason [146] (using a dierent language) that logarithms can only occur if the
theory is not nite, i.e. if the number of irreducible representations is innite. however,
this does not seem to be correct since the triplet algebra [147] has only nitely many
irreducible representations, but contains indecomposable representations in their fusion
products that lead to logarithmic correlation functions [148]. logarithmic conformal
eld theories are not actually pathological; as was shown in [41] a consistent local
conformal eld theory that satises all conditions of a local theory (including modular
invariance of the partition function) can be associated to this triplet algebra. the space
of states of this local theory is then a certain quotient of the direct sum of tensor
products of indecomposable representations of the two chiral algebras.

5.3. verlindes formula

if all chiral representations hj as well as their fusion products are completely reducible
into irreducibles, we can dene for each irreducible representation hj, its conjugate
representation hj . the conjugate representation has the property that at least one two-
point function involving a state from hj and a state from hj  is non-trivial. because of
schurs lemma the conjugation map is uniquely dened, and by construction it is clearly
an involution, i.e. (j) = j.

if conjugation is dened, the condition that the fusion product of hi and hj
contains the representation hk is equivalent to the condition that the three-point
function involving a state from hi, one from hj and one from hk is non-trivial; thus we
can identify n k
ij with the number of dierent three-point functions of suitable i  hi,
j  hj and k  hk. it is then natural to dene

nijk  n k
ij

,

which is manifestly symmetric under the exchange of i, j and k.

the fusion product is also associative,

where we have used (259). thus the matrices ni commute with each other.

because of (259) the matrices ni are normal, i.e. they commute with their adjoint
(or transpose) since n
i = ni. this implies that each ni can be diagonalised, and
since the dierent ni commute, there exists a common matrix s that diagonalises all
ni simultaneously.

what we have done so far has been a rather trivial manipulation. however, the deep
conjecture is now that the matrix s that diagonalises the fusion rules coincides precisely
with the matrix s (15) that describes the modular transformation properties of the
characters associated to the irreducible representations [149]. thus (265) provides an
expression for the fusion rules in terms of the modular properties of the corresponding
characters; with this interpretation, (265) is called the verlinde formula. this is a
remarkable formula, not least because it is not obvious in general why the right-hand-
side of (265) should dene a non-negative integer. in fact, using techniques from galois
theory, one can show that this property implies severe constraints on the matrix elements
of s [150, 151].

the verlinde formula has been tested for many conformal eld theories, and
whenever it makes sense (i.e. whenever the theory is rational), it is indeed correct. it
has also been proven for the case of the wznw models of the classical groups at integer
level [152], and it follows from the polynomial equations of moore & seiberg [115] to be
discussed below.

5.4. higher correlation functions and the polynomial relations of moore & seiberg

the higher correlation functions of the local theory do not directly factorise into
products of chiral and anti-chiral functions, but they can always be written as sums
of such products. it is therefore useful to analyse the functional form of these chiral
functions. the actual (local) amplitudes (that are linear combinations of products of the
chiral and anti-chiral amplitudes) can then be determined from these by the conditions
that (i) they have to be local, and (ii) the operator product expansion (7) is indeed
associative. these constraints dene the so-called bootstrap equations [4]; in practice

conformal field theory

55

they are rather dicult to solve, and explicit solutions are only known for a small
number of examples [41, 153158].

the chiral n-point functions are largely determined in terms of the three-point
functions of the theory. in particular, the number of dierent solutions for a given set
of non-meromorphic elds can be deduced from the fusion rules of the theory. let us
consider, as an example, the case of a 4-point function, where the four non-meromorphic
elds i  hmi, i = 1, . . . , 4 are inserted at u1, . . . , u4. (it will become apparent from
the following discussion how this generalises to arbitrary higher correlation functions.)
in the limit in which u2  u1 (with u3 and u4 far away), the 4-point function can be
thought of as a three-point function whose non-meromorphic eld at u1  u2 is the
fusion product of 1 and 2; we can therefore write every 4-point function involving
1, . . . , 4 as

h1(u1)2(u2)3(u3)4(u4)i =xk

n k

m1m2xi=1

k,idk,i

12 (u1, u2) 3(u3)4(u4)e ,

(266)

12 (u1, u2)  hk, k,i are arbitrary constants, and the sum extends over those
m1m2  1. the number of dierent three-point functions involving
m3m4, and the number of dierent solutions

12(u1, u2)  hk, 3 and 4, is given by n k

where k,i
k for which n k
k
is therefore altogether

n k

m1m2n k

m3m4 .

(267)

xk

the space of chiral 4-point functions is a vector space (since any linear combination
of 4-point functions is again a 4-point function), and in the above we have selected a
specic basis for this space; in fact the dierent basis vectors (i.e. the solutions in terms
of which we have expanded (266)) are characterised by the condition that they can be
approximated by a product of three-point functions as u2  u1.
in the notation of

describes the so-called chiral vertex operator that is associated to   hi; it is the
restriction of (u) to hk, where the image is projected onto hj and a labels the dierent
such projections (if n j
ik  2). this denition has to be treated with some care since (u)
 since the functional form of the amplitudes is no longer determined by mobius symmetry, it is possible
(and indeed usually the case) that there are more than one amplitude for a given set of irreducible
highest weight representations; see for example the 4-point function that we considered in section 5.2.

is strictly speaking not a well-dened operator on the direct sum of the chiral spaces,
ihi  indeed, if it were, there would only be one 4-point function!k

in the above we have expanded the 4-point functions in terms of a basis of functions
each of which approximates a product of three-point functions as u2  u1. we could
equally consider the basis of functions to consist of those functions that approximate
products of three-point functions as u2  u3; in the notation of moore & seiberg [40]
these are described by

h1|(cid:18) k

m1 m4(cid:19)u3;c

() |4i  h|(cid:18) m2

k m3(cid:19)u2u3;d

(2)|3i .

(270)

since both sets of functions form a basis for the same vector space, their number must
be equal; there are (267) elements in the rst set of basis vectors, and the number of
basis elements of the form (270) is

n k

m1m4n k

m2m3 .

(271)

xk

the two expressions are indeed equal, as follows from (260) upon setting m1 = j, m2 = i,
m3 = m, m4 = l, and using (259). we can furthermore express the two sets of basis
vectors in terms of each other; this is achieved by the so-called fusing matrix of moore
& seiberg [40],

m1 p(cid:19)u2;a(cid:18) m3
(cid:18) m2

m1 m4(cid:19)u3;c(cid:18) m2

q m3(cid:19)u2u3;d

.

(272)

we can also consider the basis of functions that are approximated by products of
three-point functions as u3  u1 (rather than u2  u1). these basis functions are
described, in the notation of moore & seiberg [40], by

h1|(cid:18) m3

m1 k(cid:19)u3;c

(3)(cid:18) m2

k m4(cid:19)u2;d

(2)|4i .

(273)

by similar arguments to the above, it is easy to see that the number of such basis vectors
is the same as (267) or (271). furthermore, we can express the basis vectors in (268) in
terms of the new basis vectors (273) as

m1 p(cid:19)u2;a(cid:18) m3
(cid:18) m2

where b is the so-called braiding matrix. since the correlation functions are not single-
valued, the braiding matrix depends on the equivalence class of paths along which the
conguration u2  u1 (with u4 far away) is analytically continued to the conguration
u3  u1. in fact, there are two such equivalence classes which dier by a path along
which u3 encircles u2 once; we distinguish the corresponding braiding matrices by b().

k it is possible to give an operator description for the chiral theory (at least for the case of the wznw-
models) by considering, instead of hi, the tensor product of hi with a nite-dimensional vector space
that is a certain truncation of the corresponding anti-chiral representation h [159, 160]. this also
provides a natural interpretation for the quantum group symmetry to be discussed below.

conformal field theory

57

the two matrices (272) and (274) have been derived in the context of 4-point
functions, but the notation we have used suggests that the corresponding identities
should hold more generally, namely for products of chiral vertex operators in any
correlation function. as we can always consider the limit in which the remaining
coordinates coalesce (so that the amplitude approximates a 4-point function), this must
be true in every consistent conformal eld theory. on the other hand, the identities
(272) and (274) can only be true in general provided that the matrices f and b satisfy a
number of consistency conditions; these are usually called the polynomial equations [115].
the simplest relation is that which allows to describe the braiding matrix b in
terms of the fusing matrix f , and the diagonalisable matrix . the latter is dened by

l m(cid:19)z;a
(cid:18) k

m l(cid:19)z;b
a(cid:18) k
lm(cid:1)b
=(cid:0)()k

,

(275)

where again the sign  distinguishes between clockwise (or anti-clockwise) analytic
continuation of the eld in hm around that in hl. since all three representations are
irreducible, () is just a phase,

(276)

(cid:0)()k
lm(cid:1)b

a = saei(hkhlhm)b
a ,

where sa = 1, and hi is the conformal weight of the highest weight state in hi. in
order to describe now b in terms of f , we apply the fusing matrix to obtain the right-
hand-side of (272); braiding now corresponds to  (applied to the second and third
representation), and in order to recover the right-hand-side of (274), we have to apply
the inverse of f again. thus we nd [40]

b() = f 1 (1l  ()) f .

(277)

the consistency conditions that have to be satised by b and f can therefore be
formulated in terms of f and . in essence, there are two non-trivial identities, the
pentagon identity, and the hexagon identity. the former can be obtained by considering
sequences of fusing identities in a 5-point function, and is explictly given as [40]

f23f12f23 = p23f13f12 ,

(278)

where f12 acts on the rst two representation spaces, etc., and p23 is the permutation
matrix that exchanges the second and third representation space. the hexagon identity
can be derived by considering a sequence of transformations involving f and  in a
4-point function [40]

f (()  1l)f = (1l  ()) f (1l  ()) .

(279)

it was shown by moore & seiberg [40] using category theory that all relations that arise
from comparing dierent expansions of an arbitrary n-point function on the sphere are
a consequence of the pentagon and hexagon identity. this is a deep result which allows
us, at least in principle (and ignoring problems of convergence, etc.), to construct all
n-point functions of the theory from the three-point functions. indeed, the three-point
functions determine in essence the chiral vertex operators, and by composing these
operators as above, we can construct a basis for an arbitrary n-point function. if f and

i j(cid:19) : ri  rj  rk ,
(cid:18) k

(281)

conformal field theory

58

 satisfy the pentagon and hexagon identities, the resulting space will be independent
of the particular expansion we used.

actually, moore & seiberg also solved the problem for the case of arbitrary n-point
functions on an arbitrary surface of genus g. (the proof in [40] is not quite complete;
see however [161].) in this case there are three additional consistency conditions that
originate from considering correlation functions on the torus and involve the modular
transformation matrix s (see [40] for more details). as was also shown in [40] this
extended set of relations implies verlindes formula.

5.5. quantum groups

it was observed in [40] that every (compact) group g gives rise to matrices f and b (or
let us denote by {ri} the set of irreducible
) that satisfy the polynomial equations:
representations of g. every tensor product of two irreducible representations can be
decomposed into irreducibles,

ri  rj = kv k

ij  rk ,

(280)

where the vector space v k

ij can be identied with the space of intertwining operators,

and dim(v k
rj. there exist natural isomorphisms between representations,

ij ) is the multiplicity with which rk appears in the tensor product of ri and

 : ri  rj

= rj  ri

f : (ri  rj)  rk

= ri  (rj  rk) ,

and they induce isomorphisms on the space of intertwining operators,

= v k

ji

 : v k
ij
f : r v r

ij  v l
rk

= sv l

is  v s
jk .

(282)

(283)

(284)

(285)

the pentagon commutative diagram

r1  (r2  (r3  r4))

f (r1  r2)  (r3  r4)

f ((r1  r2)  r3)  r4

 (1 f )

r1  ((r2  r3)  r4)

f

 ( f 1)

(r1  (r2  r3))  r4

then implies the pentagon identity for f (278), while the hexagon identity follows from

r1  (r2  r3)

f (r1  r2)  r3

 r3  (r1  r2)

 (1 )

 f

r1  (r3  r2)

f (r1  r3)  r2

1 (r3  r1)  r2 .

thus the representation ring of a compact group gives rise to a solution of the polynomial
relations; the fusion rules are then identied as n k

ij = dim(v k

ij ).

conformal field theory

59

the f and b matrices that are associated to a chiral conformal eld theory are,
however, usually not of this form. indeed, for compact groups we have 2 = 1 since the
tensor product is symmetric, but because of (276) this would require that the conformal
weights of all highest weight states are half-integer which is not the case for most
conformal eld theories of interest. for a general conformal eld theory the relation
2 = 1 is replaced by (+)() = 1; this is a manifestation of the fact that the elds
of a (two-dimensional) conformal eld theory obey braid group statistics rather than
permutation group statistics [162, 163].

on the other hand, many conformal eld theories possess a classical limit [40] in
which the conformal dimensions tend to zero, and in this limit the f and b matrices
come from compact groups. this suggests [40,164] that the actual f and b matrices of a
chiral conformal eld theory can be thought of as being associated to the representation
theory of a quantum group [165168], a certain deformation of a group (for reviews
indeed, the chiral conformal eld theory of the
on quantum groups see [169, 170]).
su(2) at level k has the same f and
wznw model associated to the ane algebra
b matrices [171, 172] as the quantum group uq(sl(2)) [173] at q = ei/(k+2) [174].
similar relations have also been found for the wznw models associated to the other
groups [175], and the minimal models [155, 164].

these observations suggest that chiral conformal eld theories may have a hidden
quantum group symmetry. various attempts have been made to realise the relevant
quantum group generators in terms of the chiral conformal eld theory [176179]
but no clear picture has emerged so far. a dierent proposal has been put forward
in [160] following [159] (see also [180, 181]). according to this idea the quantum group
symmetry acts naturally on a certain (nite-dimensional) truncation of the anti-chiral
representation space, namely the special subspace; these anti-chiral degrees of freedom
arise naturally in an operator formulation of the chiral theory.

the actual quantum symmetries that arise for rational theories are typically
quantum groups at roots of unity; tensor products of certain representations of such
quantum groups are then not completely reducible [182], and in order to obtain a
structure as in (280), it is necessary to truncate the tensor products in a suitable
way. the resulting symmetry structure is then more correctly described as a quasi-hopf
algebra [183,184]. in fact, the underlying structure of a chiral conformal eld theory must
be a quasi-hopf algebra (rather than a normal quantum group) whenever the quantum
dimensions are not integers: to each representation hi we can associate (because of the
perron-frobenius theorem) a unique positive real number di, the quantum dimension,
so that

n k

ijdk ,

(286)

didj =xk

where n k
ij are the fusion rules; if the symmetry structure of the conformal eld theory
is described by a quantum group, the choice di = dim(ri) satises (286), and thus each

didj xk

n k

ijdk

(288)

conformal field theory

quantum dimension must be a positive integer. it follows from (265) that

di =

si0
s00

60

(287)

satises (286);
for unitary theories this expression is a positive number, and thus
coincides with the quantum dimension. for most theories of interest this number is
not an integer for all i.

it has been shown in [185] (see also [186]) that for every rational chiral conformal
eld theory, a weak quasi-triangular quasi-hopf algebra exists that reproduces the fusing
and the braiding matrices of the conformal eld theory. this quasi-hopf algebra is
however not unique; for every choice of positive integers di satisfying

such a quasi-hopf algebra can be constructed. as we have seen above, the dimensions
of the special subspaces ds
i satisfy this inequality (235) provided that they are nite;
this gives rise to one preferred such quasi-hopf algebra in this case [160, 181].

the quantum groups at roots of unity also play a central role in the various knot
invariants that have been constructed starting with the work of jones [187189]. these
have also a direct relation to the braiding matrices of conformal eld theories [162, 163]
and can be interpreted in terms of 2 + 1 dimensional chern-simons theory [190, 191].

6. conclusions and outlook

let us conclude this review with a summary of general problems in conformal eld
theory that deserve, in our opinion, further work.

1. the local theory: it is generally believed that to every modular invariant partition
function of tensor products of representations of a chiral algebra, a consistent local
theory can be dened. unfortunately, only very few local theories have been constructed
in detail, and there are virtually no general results (see however [192]).

recently it has been realised that the operator product expansion coecients in a
boundary conformal eld theory can be expressed in terms of certain elements of the
fusing matrix f [32,34]. since there exists a close relation between the operator product
expansion coecients of the boundary theory and those of the bulk theory, this may
open the way for a general construction of local conformal eld theories.

2. algebraic formulae for fusing and braiding matrices: essentially all of the structure of
conformal eld theory can be described in terms of the representation theory of certain
algebraic structures. however, in order to obtain the fusing and braiding matrices that
we discussed above, it is necessary to analyse the analytical properties of correlation
functions, in particular their monodromy matrices. if it is indeed true that the whole
structure is determined by the algebraic data of the theory, a direct (representation
theoretic) expression should exist for these matrices as well.

conformal field theory

61

3. finite versus rational: as we have explained in this article (and as is indeed illustrated
by the appendix), there are dierent conditions that guarantee that dierent aspects of
the theory are well-behaved in some sense. unfortunately, it is not clear at the moment
what the precise logical relation between the dierent conditions are, and which of them
is crucial in distinguishing between theories that are tractable, and those that are less so.
in this context it would also be very interesting to understand under which conditions
the correlation functions (of representations of the meromorphic conformal eld theory)
do not contain logarithmic branch cuts.

4. existence of higher correlation functions: it is generally believed that the higher
correlation functions of representations of a nite conformal eld theory dene analytic
functions that have appropriate singularities and branch cuts. this is actually a crucial
assumption in the denition of the fusing and braiding matrices, and therefore in the
derivation of the polynomial relations of moore & seiberg (from which verlindes formula
can be derived). it would be interesting to prove this in general.

5. higher genus: despite recent advances in our understanding of the theory on higher
genus riemann surfaces [2729], a completely satisfactory treatment for the case of a
general conformal eld theory is not available at present.

appendix a. denitions of rationality

appendix a.1. zhus denition

according to [16], a meromorphic conformal eld theory is rational if it has only nitely
many irreducible highest weight representations. the fock space of each of these
representations has nite-dimensional weight spaces, i.e. for each eigenvalue of l0, the
corresponding eigenspace is nite-dimensional. furthermore, each nitely generated
representation is a direct sum of these irreducible representations.

if a meromorphic conformal eld theory is rational in this sense, zhus algebra is
a semi-simple complex algebra, and therefore nite-dimensional [16, 193]. zhu has also
conjectured that every such theory satises the c2 criterion, i.e. the condition that the
quotient space (218) is nite-dimensional.

if a meromorphic conformal eld theory is rational in this sense and satises the
c2 condition then the characters of its representations dene a representation of the
modular group sl(2, z) [16].

appendix a.2. the dlm denitions

dong, li & mason call a representation admissible if it satises the representation
criterion (i.e. if the corresponding amplitudes satisfy the condition (186)), and if it
possesses a decomposition of the form 
n=0mn+, where  is xed and vn()m  mn
for  =  + m for some m. a meromorphic conformal eld theory is then called
rational if every admissible representation can be decomposed into irreducible admissible
representations.

conformal field theory

62

if a meromorphic conformal eld theory is rational in this sense, then zhus algebra
is a semi-simple complex algebra (and hence nite-dimensional), every irreducible
admissible representation is an irreducible representation for which each m is nite-
dimensional and an eigenspace of l0, and the number of irreducible representations is
nite [193].

this denition of rationality therefore implies zhus notion of rationality, but it is

not clear whether the converse is true.

it has been conjectured by dong & mason [146] that the nite-dimensionality
of zhus algebra implies rationality (in either sense). this is not true as has been
demonstrated by the counterexample of gaberdiel & kausch [148].

appendix a.3. physicists denition

physicists call a meromorphic conformal eld theory rational if it has nitely many
irreducible highest weight representations. each of these has a fock space with
nite-dimensional l0 eigenspaces, and the characters of these representations form a
representation of the modular group sl(2, z). (sometimes this last condition is not
imposed.)

if a meromorphic conformal eld theory is rational in the sense of zhu and satises

the c2 condition, then it is rational in the above sense.

the notion of rationality is also sometimes applied to the whole conformal eld
its meromorphic and anti-

a conformal eld theory is called rational

theory:
meromorphic conformal subtheories are rational.
