abstract

supersymmetric cpn models based on underlying bosonic kahler manifolds have

not been thought to arise directly from constrained linear ones. a counterexample

for n = 4 is presented using improved understanding of membranes in superstring

theories leading to crucial central terms modifying the algebra of supercharge densi-

ties. the example has an immediate extension to all higher n.

it has recently been established that cp 2 can be realised as a non-linear super-

symmetric model as the result of constraining a linear supersymmetric model [1].

massless goldstone bosons arise from components of global symmetries which are

spontaneously broken. there is no extra symmetry for goldstone bosons in super-

symmetry. instead the supersymmetry forces complexication of scalars. this leads

to an increased number of massless excitations in general, with complete doubling

of the original number in some cases. despite previously believed theorems to the

contrary by lerche [2] and shore [3], the cp 2 case was established as a counter

example. the key contribution leading to this possibility was that of hughes and

polchinski [4], which showed that the original anticommutator for supersymmetric

charges had to be generalised to include a central term at the underlying current den-

sity level. this is a direct result of the more modern viewpoint that supermembranes

are just as fundamental as elementary particles in string theory. the key point seems

to be that this is a case where the symmetry of the hamiltonian is larger than the

symmetry of the s-matrix. when the anticommutator algebra for supersymmetic

charges is generalised to local form as

a(x)j

t (cid:16)j

b (y)(cid:17) = 2() t 

 4(x  y)ab + 2() cab4(x  y)

(1)

the appearance of the central terms cab is crucial. the authors take advantage of the

fact that t  is not the only unique conserved symmetric tensor since t  + c is

also conserved. thus equation (1) is clearly nite and lorentz invariant, and from it

follow the usual consequences of degenerate multiplets for unbroken supersymmetries

and goldstone fermions for those that are broken. in momentum space, with cab

diagonal and < t  >= , this gives

q < j

a(q)j

a  >= 2() ( + caa) + 0(q)

(2)

where there is no sum over a. for those a such that +caa 6= 0, equation (2) implies
a 1/6 q singularity in the two current correlation; j
a couples the vacuum to a massless

fermion with coupling strength [2(+caa)]1/2, where +caa  0. it is now clear how
to evade the extra unwanted goldstone bosons where the underlying coset manifold is

indeed kahler. the crucial point of extending the underlying algebra of supercharge

current densities by central terms has to be combined not merely with a kahler g/h,

but that manifold has to be reexpressed as a quotient of the complexied g (denoted

as gc) by a maximally extended complexication of h (denoted h). by following

the elegant treatment of itoh, kugor and kunitoma [5], this method will display an

explicit mapping manifesting the homeomorphism between g/h and gc/ h. since

the bosonic coset space for cp 4 is

g
h

=

su2  u1

,

(3)

a convenient starting point for the appropriate notation is given by the original gell-

mann matrices [6]. note that 8 and 3 are in the cartan subalgebra, and that the

raising operators are e1 = 1/2(1 + i2), e2 = 1/2(4 + i5) and e3 = 1/2(6 + i7),

with e1 = e

1 , e2 = e

2 and e3 = e

3 as the lowering operators. it is clear that all

the raising and lowering operators are nilpotent in this representation. this feature

obviously extends to larger n and ensures that constructing the kahler potential is

essentially immediate in all cases. following reference [5] a projection operator  with

its only entry a one in the bottom right hand corner is dened by

 =

1 s 1

8 ,

and the complex subgroup h specied by the relationship

h = h .

(4)

(5)

this implies that the generators of h are 8, 3, e1, e1, e2 and e3, and that e2

and e3 are the four elements of the algebra spanning gc/ h.

extending the notation of reference [1], the original (unconstrained) supersym-

metric action is constructed from nine (complex) chiral superelds. in components,

with

these have the form

ym = xm + im  ,

(x, , ) = (y) + 2(y) + 2f(y),
8(x, , ) = 8(y) + 28(y) + 2f8(y),
3(x, , ) = 3(y) + 23(y) + 2f3(y),
a(x, , ) = a(y) + 2a(y) + 2fa(y),

where a = (1, 1),

2(x, , ) = 2(y) + 22(y) + 2f(y),
3(x, , ) = 3(y) + 23(y) + 2f3(y),
(x, , ) = (y) + 2(y) + 2f 

 (y),

where  = (2, 3), m(1,  a), and the  a are the pauli matrices (a = 1, 2, 3). the
chiral superelds transform under su3 as indicated by the index structure, including

 which is a singlet. the most general supersymmetric action is then written as

i = r d8zh  + 88 + 33 + aa + 22 + 33 + i

(14)

+r d6sw +r d6s w

where the superpotential w is a functional of chiral superelds only. combining the

eight non-singlet su3 superelds with their respective matrices into the matrix

m = 88 + ... + e,

reveals that, under chiral su3  su3, m transforms as

m  lmr,

where the 5 structure is suppressed, and taking

w = k det m,

(17)

where k is a constant, ensures that the model reduces to the usual bosonic (kahler)

model below the symmetry breaking scale. this starting action now yields the po-

tential

v = f f + f8 f8 + f3 f3 + fa fa + f2 f2 + f3 f3 + f 

a + 22 + 33 + i

= 4k2 h88 + 3 3 + a

in the formal limit as k  , the action becomes
 

i = z d8z

,

as the constraints are satised by the supereld conditions

8 = 3 = a = 3 = 3 = 0.

(19)

(20)

the supereld  can again be ignored as a non-interacting spectator. notice that

the pair of complex superelds  are all that remain in the action, and they are not

constrained.

in this notation the complex coset space is written in the form [5]

l = exp(cid:18)i

2

2e2(cid:19) exp(cid:18)i

2

3e3(cid:19) ,

(21)

and this gives an explicit mapping of the homeomorphism between g/h and gc/ h.

following references [5] the kahler potential is given by

k = ln det"exp i 3 e3

2

! exp i 2 e2

2

! exp(cid:18)i2e2

2

(cid:19) exp(cid:18)i3e3

2

(cid:19)# ,

(22)

where the notation indicates that the determinant is to be taken in the bottom right

hand of the matrix in this representation. this reveals at once that

k = ln(cid:20)1 +



4 (cid:21) ,

(23)

which is the desired result. notice how this presentation deals with the main objec-

tions which arose when it was claimed in reference [1] that the generalisation directly

4

to cpn was possible. it is not necessary to nd special co-ordinates for the manifold

in order to demonstrate that it is kahler. the cp n manifolds are already known to

be kahler. it is time that having a general co-ordinate system in the cp 2 case was

very useful from a descriptive viewpoint, but it is now clear that it was not really

needed. of course it was very convenient to use the nilpotency of  + and   in the

cp 2 case, but far from being restricted to that case it is now obvious that the num-

ber of nilpotent matrices rises with n. finally, there was the well established feature

that there is an increasing number of kahler potentials with rising rank of g, and

each introduces an extra arbitrary constant. of course this current presentation just

gives one particular combination, but as is always the case with counterexamples one

is sucient.
