abstract

new equations governing the scale transformation behaviors of a
qft with underlying structures are derived. these equations, with
their several equivalent versions, can yield some new and signicant
insights and results that are dicult to see in the conventional renor-
malization programs. among the several equivalent versions, one is
similar to the usual callan-symanzik equation and renormalization
group equation but with dierent meanings. from another version,
the anomalous equation of energy-momentum tensor trace can be eas-
ily obtained. it can be shown that with the new versions one could
partially x the scheme dependence and hence some renormalization
schemes like momentum space subtractions are questionable. the
asymptotic freedom for qcd is easily reproduced at one-loop level in
our new version cse. finally the decoupling theorem a la appelquist
and carrazone are discussed within our strategy.

1 introduction

according to the standard point of view, the qfts beset with uv unphys-
ical innities could be seen as corresponding to the eective sectors of the
well-dened and complete underlying theory without uv (as well as ir) trou-
bles. the present qfts are just ill-dened formulations of the well-dened
sectors in the underlying theory. from this point of view we proposed a
natural strategy for calculating radiative corrections without introducing ad
hoc regularizations and uv innities [1, 2].

in this report, we will derive the equations governing the scale transfor-
mation behavior of the qfts with the existence of underlying structures for
making the uv (to focus on the main topic we assume from now on the ir
ends are ir regular) ends of the eective qfts well-dened. our deriva-
tion does not require anything about the renormalizability as will be clear
below. thus the equations obtained are valid for all qfts as long as they
are consistent and/or physically relevant. for the renormalizable cases, the
new equations are just new versions of the conventional callan-symanzik
equations [3].

this paper is organized in the following way: in section two we derive
the equations governing the scale behavior of an arbitrary qft with the
understanding that we work in an underlying theory version of it where
all objects are uv (and ir) well dened. then the callan-symanzik (cs)
like equation is given together with new equivalent versions in section three.
the improvements are very obvious and nontrivial. the anomalous trace
equation of the energy-momentum tensor follows naturally from a new version
of the equations as its operatoral form. in section four, we will elaborate on
the harmony revealed by the new scale wt identities and its implications
for the conventional renormalization schemes. the conventional result of
asymptotic freedom for qcd is also reproduced at 1-loop level. the scheme
dependence of the decoupling theorem `a la appelquist and carrazone [4] is
discussed in section ve in the underlying theory point of view. all these new
achievements clearly demonstrate the power and rationality of our proposal.
in section six we summarize our presentation.

2 underlying structures and scale anomalies

before starting the derivation, we briey review our strategy and its con-
sequences: suppose that the complete and well-dened underlying theory
is found, then it must contain certain additional parameters or constants
characterizing the correct uv structures underlying the present qfts. the
latter can be now formulated without any (uv) ill-denedness in the un-
derlying theory. as the underlying structures are too small comparing to
the scales of the eective theories, the latter are eectively dened in the
limit that the underlying structures vanish. but this does not mean that
the underlying structures are totally decoupled. on the contrary, as pointed
out in ref. [1, 2], the underlying structures do inuence quite nontrivially
through certain agent constants that are not included in the present qft
formulations. the well-dened formulation of the qfts are in fact dened
in terms of by the canonical model constants of qfts and the agent con-
stants. there is no room in our proposal for divergence and counter terms.
hence the meaning of all the nite constants in our proposal is dierent from
the conventionally renormalized ones.

now let us begin our derivation. consider a general complete vertex
function (or a 1pi green function), (n)([p], [g]; {}) given in the underly-
ing theory with [p], [g] denoting the external momenta and the lagrangian
couplings (including masses) and {} denoting the underlying parameters or
constants. now it is easy to see that any well-dened vertex function must
be a homogeneous function of all its dimensionful arguments, that is

(n)([p], [dg g]; {d}) = d

(n) (n)([p], [g]; {})

(1)

where d refers to the canonical scale dimension of a parameter or canonical
mass dimension of a constant (eective and/or underlying).

in the limit (l{}) that the underlying structures vanish, there will neces-
sarily arise some well-dened agent constants {c} [1, 2], then eq.(1) becomes

(n)([p], [dgg]; {dcc})  l{}(n)([p], [dgg]; {d})

= d

(n) (n)([p], [g]; {c})  d

(n) l{}(n)([p], [g]; {}).

(2)

note that these constants only appear in the loop diagrams of certain vertex
functions or in the pure quantum corrections. the limit operation will lead
to a local part of certain vertex functions with their coecients as functions

3

of the agent constants c and the largrangian constants 1. in all the following
deductions, it is understood that for any equation derived in the underlying
version ((; {})) there is a paralell version dened in terms of the agent
constants {c}. let us work in the underlying version rst.
now the dierential equation version of eq. (1) reads

n

{

xi=1

pi  pi +x dggg +x d  d(n)}(n)([p], [g]; {}) = 0.

(3)

all the scale or mass dimensions are canonical here. obviously the constants
with zero canonical mass dimensions do not cause any violation of the scale
bahavior. eqs. (1) to (3) are valid for any qft provided they are mathe-
matically consistent and/or physically eective. renormalizability is simply
not in concern here. it is clear that the scale anomalies are caused by the
indispensible existence of the underlying structures.

note that the operation dggg in the above equations inserts certain local
operators into the vertex function under consideration, which is in turn equal
to the trace of the energy-momentum tensor () for the qfts in concern (it
is an easy excercise to check this). thus we arrive at the following,

n

{

xi=1
= i(n)

pi  pi +x d  d(n)}(n)([p], [g]; {})

 ([0; p], [g]; {})

(4)

eq.(3) or equivalently eq.(4) is just the most general underlying structure
version of the ward-takahashi identity for scale transformation in (eective)
qfts. the anomalies in the eective qfts are canonical behaviors in
the underlying theory point of view as the underlying constants {} are
featuring constants there. the paralell equation of eq. (3) in terms of the
agent constants {c} that can be derived from eq.(2) read

{

n

xi=1

pi  pi +x dccc +x dggg  d(n)}(n)([p], [g]; {c}) = 0.

(5)

eqs. (3), (4) and (5) are valid not only order by order but also graph by
graph. it is very clear that the agent constants, which arise obviously from

1here the notation c takes a dierent meaning in constrast to ref. [1, 2] where we use
c to denote just the denite coecients of the local part of a vertex function. later we
will denote the coecients of the local vertices as {c}.

4

the limit operation l{}, take over all the responsibilities originally held by
the underlying structures {}. they are inherent in the well-dened
forms of the qfts. they reside not in the tree graph section of
the theories but only in the pure quantum loop graphs.

now we note the following obvious fact: since the agent constants are
arguments of the coecients (co;([g]; {c})) of the local part of certain vertex
functions loop graph (denoted as ) due to the limit operation, the variations
in these agent constants nally lead to the insertions of the local vertex
operators ([o]). some of these composite vertex operators are just given
by the lagrangian. then the insertion of some of these operators can be
realized through the variation with respect to the couplings in the lagrangian
(the insertion of the kinetic terms and others that can not be found in the
lagrangians will be generally denoted as io). that is, with the following
facts valid for the complete vertex functions,

o;([g]; {c})  dco;([g]; {c})  x{c}
x dccc = x{o;}
dco;co;co; = x{cl}

x{cl}
x{cn }

dclclcl = x[g]
dcn cn cn = x{on }

g([g]; {c})gg +x{}

dc

cco;
co;c

,

dclclcl + x{cn }
([g]; {c}) i,

dcn cn cn ,

(6)

(7)
(8)

(9)

we can turn eq.(5) into the following forms,

{ + x{co;}

dco;co;co; +x[g]

dggg  d(n)}(n)([p], [g]|{co;}) = 0,

on

{ + x{on }
d(n)}(n)([p], [g]|{co;}) = 0,

ion +x[g]

(g + dg)gg +x{}

 i

(10)

(11)

here the insertion of the kinetic vertex of a eld  is denoted as i. 
or dc denote the coecients before the inserted composite operators. (a
vertex functions dependence upon the agent constants is eected through

5

the local coecient constants after the vertical bar.) eq.(10) is true order
by order, graph by graph while eq.(11) is only true for the complete sum
of all graphs (or sum up to a certain order). the constants {c} must
satisfy all the above equations as functions of the agent constants and the
model constants that are classically dened. thus one can view the above
equations as constraints imposed by the most natural facthomogeneity
upon these constants. moreover, the above equations are readily true for the
connected but one-particle-reducible correlation functions of elds (and even
composite operators) as long as one works in the underlying theory version
or its eective theory limit.

although in eq.(11) we have rewritten some of anomalies in terms of the
insertions of the composite operators appearing in the lagrangian, they are
specifying the scale behaviors of the theoriess quantum structures, not
that of the classical constants.
in fact they describe the inuences of the
normal scale behaviors of the underlying structures unpon the eective
qfts. later, in section four, we will discuss more closely about this point
followed by some signicant conequences which have not been achieved in
the conventional renormalization programs.

3 new versions of callan-symanzik equation

and rge

in this section we limit our attention to a special type of theories where there

of the lagrangian operators. in conventional terminology, we consider in this
section only renormalizable theories.

is no variations in certain local vertices (those denoted by p dcn cn cn or
p{on } on ([g]; {c}) ion in eq.(9)) that can not be realized through insertions
without the variations necessarily described by p dcn cn , eqs. (10) and

(11) should take the following form,

dclclcl  d(n)}(n)([p], [g]|{c}) = 0,

{ +x dggg + x{cl}
{ +x(g + dg)gg +x  i  d(n)}(n)([p], [g]|{c}) = 0,

(12)

(13)

these are just some new versions of the cs equations for renormalizable
theories. before turning them into more familar forms,let us rst make the
following remarks.

as pointed out in section two, the most striking dierence between [g]
and {c} is that the former are dened in the tree level vertices while
the latter only appear in loop amplitudes. the classical constants [g] or
the tree level vertices alone can not yield a well-dened denition of the
quantum structures of elds for theories with potential uv divergence2. but
the incompleteness of the constants [g] or the unavailability of {} by now
does not mean that there must be divergence. of course among {} or their
agents {c} that characterize the quantum paths, there must be ones with
mass dimensions specifying the eective quantum motions scale(s). in our
opinion, this is the physical basis of the necessary appearance of a mass or
energy scale in any regularization/renormalization scheme. in our strategy,
these scales naturally appear in the course of indenite integrations.

on the other hand, the locality of the appearance of these quantum agents
does allow a mix among [g] and the agent constants (through {c([g]; {c})})
for the complete vertex functions or their generating functional in renor-
malizable theories. suppose there are scale transforms in the agent constants,
then

x{c}
= {x[g]

dccc(n)(   |{c([g]; {c})}) = x{c}
ggg +x{}

 i}(n)(   |{c([g]; {c})})

which is equivalent to

dccc(n)(   |{c([g]; {c})})

(14)

dccc}(n)(   |{c([g]; {c})})

{x{c}
= {x{c}

dccc  x{c}
dccc x[g]

ggg x{}

 i}(n)(   |{c([g]; {c})}) = 0. (15)

it is easy to see that the invariance in eq.(15) is in fact a rearrangement
of the classically dened parts and that arising from quantum loops or a

2in this sense, the present standard quantization procedures are not absolutely well-
dened as they have not been able to specify the quantum agent constants for such theories.
for more detailed elaboration of this point please refer to ref.[5].

tautology of the fact that agent constants changes only aect the elementary
like local vertices as evident in eq.(14). this is our new version of the
renormalization group equation.

now let us turn the kinetic terms contribtuion into other forms. this can
be achieved by noting that the coecient constants in the kinetic vertices
only renormalize or rescale the line momenta in the graphs. for example,
for the fermions, this is just the rescaling of ip/  (1 + c)ip/ 3. similarly for
bosons, ip2  (1 + c)ip2. since the lines must end up in various vertices,
such rescaling of lines would eectively lead to the rescaling of vertices and

be shared by the latter in pairs. thus a vertex is typically rescaled as qi(1 +
ci)1/2qj(1 + cj )1/2 depending on the number of line momenta that join

it. for an n-point 1pi vertex function there must be n external momenta
ow into or out of a number of elementary vertices in the graphs. as the
external momenta are not subject to the rescaling there must be compensated
rescaling for these vertices containing external momentaan overall rescaling
of the complete n-point vertex functions. thus we have


g  g  (g  ng;
2
g  g  (g  or), dg 6= 0;
(n,n)  (1 + c)n/2(1 + c)n/2(n,n).

), dg = 0;

 ng;

then the above equations take the following forms:

{ +x(g + dg)gg + n

(n,n)([p], [g]|{c}) = 0,

+ n

}(n,n)([p], [g]|{c}) = 0.

(16)

(17)

(18)

one can see that eqs.(17) and (18) take exactly the same form as the usual
cse and rge. but we must emphasize again here that everything here is

3we express such nite renormalization in terms of the various vertices and lines appear-
ing in graphs as these are the original places where the agent constants or the coecient
constants really appear.

given in terms of the classical constants [g] and agent constants. one might
take the [g] as our nite bare constants.

now some remarks are in order:
(1). each equation is given in terms of the classically dened constants
[g] and the quantum agents denitely dened in the complete underlying
theory, no divergence and hence no innite renromalization is needed.
in
the conventional schemes, divergence is inevitable due to the articiality of
the regularization methods and hence innite renormalization is necessary.
then after subtraction, one needs to reidentify the originally classically
dened constants with a product of two singular objectsbare quantities and
the renormalization constants.

(2). conventionally, the innite bare quantities are in fact regularizarion
scheme dependentdierent divergnce in dierent schemes, therefore scheme
dependence is inherent there as innite renormalization only transforms the
expressions not the essence.
in the underlying theory point of view this
problem is due to the articiality of the regularization schemes for simulating
the true underlying structures 4. there should be only one physical scheme,
the one with the true agent constants selected by the nature together with
the classically dened lagrangian constants apart from some redenition
freedom for the special type theories described in eqs. (14), (15) or (18).

let us take qed as an example for demonstration.
the cs equation and rge in conventional renormalization schemes read

respectively [6]

{ + (1 + mr)mrmr  r + naa  n + d(na,n )}
(na,n)([p], mr, r) = 0;
{  mrmrmr + r  naa  n}(na,n)([p], mr, r) = 0.

(19)

(20)

while to write down our new version cse and rge for qed we need to
be specic on the following aspects: among the agent constants there is at

4conventioanlly, it is believed that the scheme dependence is only inherent in the per-
turbative truncations but not in the full renormalized theory, basing on the expectation
that the low energy theories are independent of the short distance structures and hence
independent of regularization schemes. this is not correct as even the underlying con-
stants do not show up in the eective theory, they do aect the eective theories through
their agent constants. the scale anomalies are just the evidences of the inuences of the
underlying structures. otherwise, why bother choosing among regularizations?

9

least one mass scale parameter, we will denote it as  and parametrize all
the agents into one mass scale and a series of constants {ci;0} with zero mass
dimention so that the coecients take the following form

cm = cm(m, e; ) + cm;0({ci;0}),
ce = ce(m, e; ) + ce;0({ci;0}) = c,
ca = ca(m, e; ) + ca;0({ci;0}).

(21)

where the ward-takahashi identity for gauge invariance is used. then from
eqs.(12) to (18) we can write down our new cse and rge in several equiv-
alent versions as follows

{ + mm + dcmcmcm + dcacaca + dc cc  d(na ,n )}
(na,n)([p], m, e|{cm, ce, ca, c})

= { + (1 + m)mm + eee + a ia +  i  d(na ,n )}

(na,n)([p], m, e|{cm, ce, ca, c})

= { + (m + 1)mm +

(n)([p], m, e|{cm, ce, ca, c}) = 0;

 d(na ,n )}

(22)

(23)

now we can compare our new cse and rge in (22) and (23) with the
conventional ones in (19) and (20). the anomalies are all described in our
equations in terms of the classical constants m, e or () and the agents , c,
while in the conventional renormalization schemes the anomalies are given
in terms of the renormalized constants mr, r depending on an arbitrary
scale  via the innite renormalization constants. to the lowest order the
correspondence should be

mr  m  (m  ); (r) = 2a  a  2e; 2  .

(24)

10

we note again that the equations expressed in terms of the coecient con-
stants directly are valid order by order and graph by graph as well as for the
complete sum or sum up to a certain order while the ones given in terms of
vertex insertions are only valid for the complete sum or sum up to certain
order (so it is with the conventional cse and rge).

now we have derived the equations governing the scale transform behavior
of qfts with underlying structures. the new equations are totally given in
terms of classically dened model constants and the agent constants that have
not been predicted but are extremely important for a complete denition
of the eective qfts. no divergence should be there at all which are
artefacts of ad hoc regularizations. we have given several equivalent forms
of equations, one only in terms of the agent constants, one in terms of local
vertex insertions and one takes the usual form of the conventional cse and
rge but with no innite renormalization. each is suitable for dierent
purposes. the utility and power of the conventional form of cse and rge
has been well known. below and in section four we will demonstrate the
utility of the other two versions that has not expected in the conventional
frameworks.

from the experiences above it is also easy to derive the wt identity of
scale transformation for generating functional of vertex functions of a qft
from homogeneity,

{x{}z ddx[d  x  x)(x)]

1p i ([], [g]; {c})

= {x{}z ddx[d  x  x)(x)]

1p i ([], [g]; {c}) = 0.



(x)



(x)

+x[g]

dggg +x{c}

dccc  d}

+x[g]

(dg + g)g +x{}

 i  d}

(25)

with d denoting the spacetime dimension. again this is correct for any
consistent qfts.

to exhibit the utility of the version in terms of the operator insertion,
we simply note that once it is translated into the operatoral form we get
the anomalous trace equation of quantum energy-momentum tensor since
all the quantum eects all well dened here and all the eects have been
given in terms of known quantum operators. thus one can just read the

11

trace equation from the operator insertion version of eq.(25), for qed this
is simply

g = (1 + m)m  +

af f  i d

1
4

= (1 + m  )m  +

1
4

af f.

(26)

in the last step we have used the motion equation. considering the corre-
pondence in eq. (24), this is exactly the operatoral trace anomaly equation
for qed [7] in a new version without divergence and subractions.
in un-
renormalizable theories, the trace anomalies would contain an innite sum
of local composite operators beyond the lagrangian operators.

in next section we will illustrate the correctness of our new wt iden-
tity or new cs equation in unconventional versions in several examples and
demonstrate their physical utility and signicance.

4 harmony contraint on the agent constants

from section two we see that the well-dened vertex functions or their gen-
erating functional for a qft must be homogeneous with respect to all the
dimensional parameters and constants which must include the underlying
structures or their agents. that is to say, for this homogeneity to be
valid in a well-dened formulation the underlying structures are indispensi-
ble. therefore in the underlying theory point of view the scale transform
is in perfect harmony in the following sense: when all the arguments scale
up together according to their normal scale or mass dimensions the vertex
functions(al) must then exhibit exact scale behaviors. this is the harmony
principle we wish to advocate that is understandable only in terms of under-
lying structures.

this harmony leads to a natural explanation for the scale or trace anomaly.
on the one hand, in the underlying theory formulation, there is no scale
anomaly. the scale behavior is denite and normal there. in the course of
scale transformation of all elds and all constants, there should be generally
tranformations into each other (just like any symmetry transformation) in a
denite way to preserve the overall homogeneity. then as we only eectively
observe the relatively low sectors variables and their behavior, the nonex-
act scale variations of the eective variables that should be absorbed by the

12

underlying structures variations are therefore exposed. thus it is equally
correct to interpret the anomalies as the normal contributions of underly-
ing strucutres and as the anomalous behaviors of the eective sectors that
should be unambiguous in terms of the canonical variables of eective theo-
ries 5. they are the two faces of one thing. chiral anomaly can be understood
in similar way [9]. we hope this harmony principle could be generalized to
other tranformation behaviors of the eective theories.

all our derivations and arguments has been presented with the assump-
tion that the underlying theory version of the qfts are known. of course
this is not true. then we must try to determine them otherwise. how-
ever, there are quite many constraints for these unknown constants or to
reduce the ambiguities associated with them, say, the novel symmetries of
the eective qft systems.
it is known in gauge eld theories that gaug
invariance reduces the number of ambiguities (or the number of independent
divergences in conventional terminology). here, with the harmony notion
elaborated above, further important constraints upon the ambiguities can
be imposed. this scale harmony has in fact locked the scale behaviors of
the agent constants with that of the denite parts of the eective theories
and hence the ambiguities are further reduced. now let us enumerate some
examples to illustrate the validity of our new cs equations and the role of
ambiguity reduction of these equations in the notion of harmony.

first let us see that the scale anomalies are denite at 1-loop level (let
us still work in qed) in electron self-energy (1), electron-photon vertex
 and photon polarization . for simplicity let us consider the cases
(1)
of massless electrons. as for the expressions of these objects in terms of
the unknown agent constants, one can use any regularization to compute
the denite part and just leave the ambiguous local part as an ambiguous
polynomial of external momentum. or one can use the technique introduced
in ref.
[1, 2]. (we will also explain this technique later.) it is sucient
to parametrize the agant constants with one dimensional constant  and a

5we had shown elsewhere [8] and will further demonstrate below that scale or trace
anomaly is in fact due to the presence of a kind of rational terms that are nonlocal
(hence denite at least in 1-loop level). the presence of this kind of rational terms is
unambiguous or independent of regularization schemes. it is in this sense the anomaly is
a denite property of qft.

e({c0})];

a({c0})].

(27)

here all the constants are meant for 1-loop case and the superscript 0 of
the constants means that these constants are dimensionless and independent
of any dimansional constants and we work in feynman gauge. then these
objects have scale anomalies in terms of canonical variables only (here only
momentum)

{p  p  1}(1) = i

e2
82 p/;

{p  p}(1)

 = +i

{p  p  2}(1) = i

e2
82 ;
e2
62 (p2g  pp).

(28)

now if we include the agent constants contributions, which is  (the
dimensionless agent simply do not aect scale behavior), then we can recover
the exact scale behavior or the exact scale harmony in the version with
explicit agent constants which is valid order by order, graph by graph:

{p  p +   1}(1) = 0;
{p  p + }(1)
{p  p +   2}(1) = 0.

 = 0;

(29)

this is just harmony we have explained above. the dimensional agent con-
stant  must appear in the vertices as ln2. they must compensate the
unambiguous anomalies from the denite and nonlocal parts. (but the other
dimensionless agent constants remain undetermined by the scale wt iden-
tities.) it is easy to see that the anomaly in each 1-loop vertex above is due
to the logarithmic dependence upon momentum which upon the action of
p  p yields a local term from a nonlocal one: (p  p)lnp2 = p( 2p
p2 ) = 2. or

14

if one starts with the insertion of the dilatation current into the elementary
vertices there should be an unbiguous rational term in terms of momentum
only like  pp
p2 which yields a local terms after contracting with divergence
operation p  pq p

p2 = q p. by the way, we note that the conventional

version of cse and the one in terms of vertex insertions can not hold order
by order and graph by graph but only for the complete vertex functions or
sums up to certain order.

if one sums the verices up to 1-loop level with tree graph vertices included

she/he could get the vertex insertion version as follows,

it is easy to see that the anomalies are independent of mass. one can
recalculate the 1-loop corrections of the above vertices in the massive case
with the technique we proposed [1, 2]. here we just list the photon polariza-
tion case given by chanowitz and ellis [10] but parametrize the local parts
following our strategy,

where the anomaly is exactly the same as in the massless case.

now if we include the  operation amd that of the mass, there should
not be any anomaly as all dimensional arguments are harmonically consid-
ered. thus the anomaly must be assumed up by the dimensional agents

(35)

(36)

where the only dimensional constant besides the agent  is fermion mass
here 6. thus we have locked the behavior of the underlying structures acted
by their agent(s). or each agent constant associated with a ill-dened loop
integration must appear in the way expressed in eq.(36). it is easy to see
that all the other elementary vertices should exhibit the same feature. this
is quite a natural conclusion following from the standard underlying theory
point of view. in a sense the harmony notion elaborated here xes the agent
constants to a certain degree. the xation of the constants here corresponds
to the subtraction procedure in the conventional renormalization programs
where the dependence of the renormalized amplitudes upon the subtraction
points can be almost arbitrary. our discussion above simply rejects all the
schemes where the dependence of the residual local parts of the elementary
vertices upon the subtraction scale is dierent from that given by eq.(36) in
the rst place before referring to other problems of the schemes. this could
not have been achieved in the conventional renormalization programs.

therefore according to the foregoing discussions, the subtraction schemes
eected at euclidean momentum are questionable for the massive case 7.
here we must mention that the dependence on the agent constants in the way
specied in eq.(36) is conventionally subject to the nondecoupling diculty
[12]. however, this is not a real challenge by noting that the underlying
formulation is correct only when the limit l{} is valid with repsect to all
eective parameters including the agents. when a mass goes to innity, the

6one can easily see the homogeneous dependence on 2

m2 by noting that if the nonpoly-
nomial momentum dependent part has mass to fulll the homogeneity, then the coecients
must depend on mass in this way. one can also see this point by directly solving the scale
wt identity in the agent constants version, i.e., using eq. (12) or (5) that is valid graph
by graph.

7this is not to say the other schemes are totally ok. it is known that some regular-
ization schemes like dimensional regularization sometimes leads to oversubtraction and
are therefore questionable in certain applications [11]. the most crucial point is that all
regularization schemes are ad hoc ones contain various ill-denedness.

16

expressions that have been obtained by assuming it is nite are no longer
true. we will make further dicussions on this issue in section ve.

the natural appearance of the dimensional agents in the way dictated in
eq. (36) can also be technically understood in the following way. first we
need to briey review the technique we proposed solely based on the existence
of the underlying structures for providing well-dened formulations [1, 2] as
follows: for a 1-loop graph g of supercial divergence degree g  1 [13]
with its underlying version amplitude denoted as g([p], [g]; {}), we have

[p] l{}g([p], [g]; {}) = l{}g
g

[p] g([p], [g]; {})

[p] g([p, k], [g]; {})] = z ddk[g

[p] l{}g([p, k], [g]; {})]

= l{}z ddk[g
= z ddkgg([p, k], [g]; {}) = g
[p] ]1g

g})  [g

g([p], [g]; {cg([g]; {c})}) = l{}g([p], [g]; {}) 
g([p], [g]; {cu

g ([p], [g])

g ([p], [g]),

(37)

(38)

where g
[p] and its inverse denote the dierentiation (for  times) with respect
to the external momenta (one can do the same with respect to masses in cer-
tain cases like for tadpole graphs) and the indenite integration respectively.
we can not get the denite agent constants or the coecient constants but
a set of unknown constants {cu
g} instead in our technical treatment. the
justication of eq.(37) is basing on the natural assumption that the under-
lying structures make the qfts well dened and the low energy limit does
not alter the well-denedness.

our above analysis implies that these unknown constants are to be dened
as the true agents through various physical properties. there must be at least
one constant with mass dimension among the constants {cu
g} as the result of
the indenite integration though its precise value are to be xed otherwise
g}) as  ln 2
and it must appear in the polynomial part of g([p], [g]; {cu
m2
where m is a mass among the model constants [g]. this can be seen by
observing that the amplitude g
g ([p], [g]) must take the following form (with
appropriate feynman parametrization)

g

g ([p], [g])  z 1

0

[dx]f ({x})

l([p], [gm]|{x})
[q([p], [gm]|{x})]

(39)

with l(  ) and q(  ) denoting respectively the linear and quadratic expres-
sions of the combination of dimensional parameters like external momenta

17

and masses with the help of feynman parameters {x}. then on the rst step
indente integration with respect to the external parameters a logarithmic
expression is generated with an arbitrary mass scale entered for balancing
the mass dimensions,

zindef

dpg

g ([p], [g])  z 1

0

[dx]f ({x})ln( q([p], [gm]|{x})

2

) .

(40)

further indenite integrations with respect to the external parameters of
mass dimension would necessarily carry on this mass scale in the polynomial
part.
if one trades the  in the logarithmic function with a model mass
constant so that the nonpolynomial function of momenta only involve model
mass parameters, the  would only appear in the polynomial part in the form
of ln 2
m2 just as we claimed through scale anomaly analysis. the multiply-
ing factor of this logarithmic function is nothing else but the anomalous
dimension:([g0]). thus at 1-loop level, for all local ambiguities, we can
claim that:

c overt([g]; {, c0

i }) =

1
2

 overtln( 2

m2) + c 0

overt

({c0

i }).

(41)

the superscript 0 indicates that its principal is totally independent of any
constants with nonzero mass dimension.

our techincal proposal can be very naturally generalized to the multi-
loop cases and many conventional subtlties like overlapping divergences are
automatically resolved, please refer to ref. [2] 8. we will provide more ex-
amples of calculations in the proposed technique in future reports, expecially
in the nonperturbative case where the conventional regularization schemes
often yield more severe divergences.

before closing this section we simply demonstrate that the asymptotic
freedom of qcd can be easily reproduced in our new version of cse. the
new version cse for the two-point connected correlation function of gauge

8moreover, according to this technique, the new ambiguities in the potentially divergent
multiloop graphs beyond the subgraph ambiguities must appear in the local part as ln 2
m2 .
thus summing all the overall local parts associated with each graph would lead to local
vertices with conecients  [1+ 1
i })]. that is the underlying
structures only renormalize the model constants [g] by simple logarithmic dependence
on the masses and an agent scale.

(46)

(47)

the asymptotic freedom is clearly reproduced for qcd due to the nega-
tive constant a at one-loop level. the solution of the eective coupling
given in eq.(47) corresponds to the one-particle-reducible two-point
green function whose cse is given in terms of variations in the one-perticle-
irreducible vertices. the ir landau pole in the eective coupling for
qcd can not be trusted as we have worked in the uv end with ir details
coarsed away. for qed, the landau pole is uv one (due to positive a),
but it is not a nal answer before the higher order corrections of a are
included. moreover, as the energy is extremely higher, there is another prob-
lem: the underlying structures would interfere with the eective sectors

19

more strongly, i.e., the present qft models must be modied somehow.
this is closely related with the validity of the limit operation l{} and will
be discussed in more details in next section. here our solution is trustable
at energies not extremely high. it is also worthwhile to note that due to the
dierence in the denitions of the anomalies, there is multivaluedness in
the eective couplings solved from the conventional cse or rge due to the
reidentication mentioned in section three (remarks following eq.(18)),
while our new cse is free from this defect.

5 decoupling theorem and underlying struc-

tures

now let us turn to the decoupling issue of the heavy particles in qfts.

as we have noted in last section, due to the logarithmic dependence of
the local constants (coi) upon the particle mass ( lnm2,see eq.(41)) these
constants would diverge as the particles become extremely heavy (m  )
and this in turn implies the nondecoupling of the heavy particles. while in
the subraction schemes eected at euclidean momentum, the heavy particles
contributions to the light sector vanish as the masses go to innity [4, 12].

to resolve this scheme dependence of decoupling phenomenon, we note
that from the underlying theory point of view, when a physical mass or mass
scale goes to innity relative to the characteristic energy scale of an eective
physical system, it means that the physics associated with this innite en-
ergy scale belongs to the uv underlying sectors of the eective system. or
the heavy particles now join the underlying structures party and the under-
lying constants {} are no longer innities for such heavy particles, then the
expressions containing ln 2
m2 that have arisen from the limit operation l{}
is no longer valid, or equivalently, the following operation is simply illegal if
one really accepts the underlying theory point of view,

limmln

2
m2 .

(48)

the correct procedure is now to expand the set of underlying constants {}
to include the extremely heavy particles masses and rewrite the whole qft
in terms of eective parameters of the light particles or elds. then the limit

20

operation l{} now changes to l{;(mheavy )} for the light objects and like other
underlying structures, these heavy particles inuences are delegated to the
agent constants that nally appear from the new limit operation l{;(mheavy )}.
since these agants are nite in principle, the eects of the heavy particles
only renormalize the light sectors by a nite amount in the local vertices.
in the sense of (48), it is also easy to see that the expressions obtained at
nite momenta for qfts can not be simply extrapolated to the uv limit as
it would again invalidate the limit operation about the underlying structures.
equivalently, one can let the energy and masses of the light sectors become
relatively innitesimal comparing to the heavy sectors, then the light sectors
would be again given in terms of masses and couplings belonging to the
light sectors and additional nite agent constants appearing only in the local
vertices of the light elds. this is just the spirit behind the heavy quark eld
theory [12].

as the eetive parameters like mass and momenta become extremely
large, such elds would interact more directly with the underlying struc-
tures. then the limit of decoupling the underlying structures for these heavy
or high-energy elds are no longer valid and one has to work in models suit-
able for more higher energy physics. thus the scheme dependence of the
decoupling theorem is again closely connected to the indispensible existence
of the underlying structures for making the qfts naturally well dened. the
intimate relation between the decoupling theorem and the existence of the
underlying structures will be investigated intensively in the future. more-
over, to make the formulation completely well dened, the ir underlying
structures should be included in all the future investigations.

conventionally, the subtaction point is deemed as arbitrary, a running
scale. while in the underlying theory point of view, due to the condition
of decoupling theorem or the validity of the le limit operation, such scales
(agent constants) should be uniquely dened up to possible equivalence. one
could not arbitrarily rescale any eective parameter (like mass and energy)
and any agent constant (which characterizes the quantum structures of an
eective sector in addition to the planck constant and eective parameters,
see section ii and iii). once a scale is extrapolated to a place where the eec-
tive qft models kreak down, the formulations in terms of the le eective
parameters and agent constants cease to be correct or useful.

21

6 summary

from our discussions above, we can see that the underlying theory postulate
is quite natural and powerful. many subtle issues in conventional schemes are
resolved in a natural way in our proposal [2]. the new equations governing
the scale behaviors are formulated in terms of canonical and agent constants
that are well dened. the most signicant technical prediction from our
investigations here is the irrationality of certain conventional renormalization
schemes. we could also reproduce many novel results. the derivation of trace
anomaly in the underlying theory approach is a simple work.

as the scheme dependence in high energy applications of qcd is a very
important issue, we hope our investigations here could be of help to it. of
course our main goal here has been to demonstrate the plausibility and power
of our recent proposal for renormalization, further development and applica-
tions of the proposal will be made in the future. we hope our strategy could
lead to more important contributions to high energy physics and beyond.
the issue of gauge dependence of the cse in gauge eld theories will be
discussed in the future together with the ir problem in such qfts.

in summary, we derived several new versions of the ward-takahashi iden-
tities of scale transformations in any qft models along the natural strategy
for dealing with the uv ill-denedness. among these new versions, each has
its own advantage and utility in dierent situations. our expressions are all
free from divergences and the associated innite renormalization. the new
equations improve the conventional ones in several aspects. a most impor-
tant new result is that the nite local part of any potentially divergent ver-
tex graph can not be arbitrary and therefore some conventional subtraction
schemes are, according to the underlying theory point of view, unreasonable
choices. the important decoupling theorem a la applequist and carrazone
is argued to be still valid outside euclidean momenta subtraction schemes
with the underlying structures appropriately accounted.
