two kinds of realizations of symmetry on classical domains or the euclidean version

of ads space are used to study ads/cft correspondence. mass of free particles is

dened as an ads group invariant, the klein-gordon and dirac equations for relativistic

particles in the ads space are set up as a simple mimic in the case of minkowskian

space. the bulk-boundary propagator on the ads space is given by the poisson kernel.

theorems on the poisson kernel guarantee the existence and sole of the bulk-boundary

propagator. the propagator is used to calculate correlators of the theories that live on

the boundary of the ads space and show conformal invariance, which is desired by the

ads/cft correspondence.

1. to understand the relations between gauge eld theories and string theory is

a longstanding problem. the answer to the question will oer us a theory of strong

coupling mysteries of qcd. the ads/cft correspondence states that string theory

in anti-de sitter (ads) spacetime is holographically dual to a conformal eld theory

(cft) on the spacetime boundary of the ads[1][4]. beyond reasonable doubt, the

maldacena dualities[1] between 4-dimensional n = 4 supersymmetric su(n) gauge
theory and the type iib string theory on the background ads5  s5 has been es-
tablished. equivalence between theories in dierent dimensions immediately raises

questions about how detailed bulk information in one theory can be completely coded

in low dimensional degrees of freedom[5][8]. although there exist a large amount of

evidence, we have not yet any direct translation of the congurations of one theory to

the other. nonperturbative formulations for string and m theory should be set up to

investigate such a translation between theories in dierent dimensional spacetimes.

the maldacena conjecture is heavily dependent on peculiar properties of the ads

spacetime. it is natural to begin such a program from discussing symmetry realizations

of the ads group in the ads spacetime. here we use two kinds of realizations on

classical domains[9, 10], which may be viewed as the euclidean version of the ads

spacetime, to study some properties of the ads/cft correspondence.

2.

it is useful to consider the (n + 1)-dimensional ads space adsn+1 as a sub-

manifold of a pseudo-euclidean (n + 2)-dimensional embedding space with coordinates
(y) = (y0, y1,   , yn+1) and metric

with length squared

 = diag(+,,,   ,

n

xi=1

(yi)2 + (yn+1)2 = a2

preserved by the ads group so(2, n) acting as

y  y = 

 y ,


  so(2, n) .

the metric of the ads in the embedding space is given by

ds2 = 

n

xi=1

(dyi)2 + (dy0)2 + (dyn+1)2 .

(1)

(2)

making use of the coordinate y, we can discuss motions of free relativistic particles in

the ads space. for this aim, we rst dene the (n+2)-dimensional angular momentum

2

l as

l = y dy

ds  y dy

ds

.

l should be conservative for the free particle, so that

dl
ds

= 0

(3)

(4)

should be its equations of motion. on the other hand, l may be viewed as a set of

classical realizations for generators of the ads group so(2, n). at this representation,

the casimir-like invariant of the ads group may be dened as square of mass of the

free particle as follows:

m2

0 =

1
2a2

ll

= e2  p2 

l2
a2

,

(5)

where e 

1
a

ln+1,0 and p 

1
a

ln+1,i.

it is interesting to see that in the projective space realization (see below in 4.), we

may identify p i and lij as momentum and angular momentum of the free particle in

the ads space, respectively. and eq.(5) gives rise to the generalization of einsteins
famous formula e2  p2 = m2

0e in the special relativity.

on the other hand, it is well-known that the operator form of einsteins formula

gives the klein-gordon equation  the relativistic quantum equation of motion for a

free scalar particle or the relativistic equation of motion for free scalar eld. a simple

mimic of quantization at at spacetime gives the operator counterpart of the classical

variables l,

l  l = i y


y  y



y! .

(6)

the operator forms of l are, in fact, generators of the ads group. the corresponding

casimir operator is of the form

q =

1
2a2

l l .

(7)

at this stage, we can set up equations of motion in relativistic quantum mechanics

of ads invariant as eigenvalue equation of the casimir operator q and it is independent

3

of details of representation of the ads. the klein-gordon equation for relativistic scalar

particles in ads spacetime can be introduced as

( q  m2

0) = 0 .

(8)

in a general frame with coordinates xi and metric gij (i, j = 0, 1,
operator q of the ads group is of the form

   , n), the casimir

q =

1

g



xi  ggij 

xj! .

thus, a general form of the klein-gordon equation in ads space is



" 1

xi  ggij 

xi!  m2

0# (x) = 0 .

(9)

(10)

for spinors, analogue to dirac operator in the minkowskian space, we can introduce

an ads invariant operator as

where

it is easy to check that

l =

(11)

(12)

therefore, similar to the case of minkowskian space, the dirac operator in ads space is

a square root of the casimir operator of the ads group. then the eigenvalue equation
of the dirac-like operator l may be viewed as the relativistic equation of motion for
spinors,

[ii(i  i) + m0](x) = 0 ,

(13)

where i is the ricci rotational coecient

[k, i] = ki ( l

ik ) l .

3. in what follows, let us focus on the euclidean version of the adsn+1. if we write
a real (n + 1)-dimensional vector as x = (x0, x1,   , xn) and x is the transport of x,
the adsn+1 can be expressed as

xx < 1 ,

(14)

with the metric

ds2 = 
the coordinates xi and ya are related as

(15)

it is not dicult to show that the transformation

 =

x  b  xxb + x(2bb  bbi)

1  2bx + bbxx

,

bb < 1 ,

(16)

makes the ads (xx < 1) to ads ( < 1), boundary of the ads (xx = 1) to boundary

of the ads ( = 1) and the center (x = b) of the ads to the center ( = 0) of the

ads. here i denotes the identity operator in the ads.

the inverse transformation is of the form

x =

 + b + b + (2bb  bbi)

1 + 2b + bb

,

bb < 1 .

(17)

we see that, besides of the point  =  b

bb , the transformation (16) is 1-1 correspondent.

besides the above transformations, it is easy to see that

 = x ,

 = i

(18)

also transforms the ads to ads but with invariant original point. the transformations

(16) and (18) give a kind of realization of the ads group on the ads space. this

realization may be called hyper-sphere realization.

5

for this realization of the ads group, there is an invariant dierential of the form

on the ads space

and the invariant dierential operator is

this is just the laplace equation, i.e. the klein-gordon equation, of the massless scalar

eld.

it is convenient to introduce the spherical coordinates

uu = 1 ,

x = u ,
dxdx = d2 + 2dudu ,
dudu = d21 + sin2 1d22 + sin2 1 sin2 2d23 +    + sin2 1    sin n1d2n ,

0  1,

   , n1   ,

the unit area element on the ads boundary is as follows:

du = sinn1 1 sinn2 2    sin n1d1d2    dn .

from

dd = 

we know that on the spherical surface x = u,  = v , uu = vv = 1 there is a relation

(28)

where hu, vi denotes the angle between the vectors u and v. the bulk-boundary prop-
agator ge

b(x, u) has the following properties:

 because 1  2 coshu, vi + 2  (1  )2, we always have ge

b(x, u) = 1 .

(29)

(30)

 at the case of  < 1, the bulk-boundary propagator satises eq.(20).

these properties guarantee the existence of the poisson formula eq.(26). this shows

the existence of the bulk-boundary propagator for klein-gordon equation. the ads/cft

correspondence states that[3]

zbulk[(0)] = heruu

=1

r du0(u)o(u)icft .

(31)

here ln zbulk is the eective action for string theory on adsn+1 considered as a func-

tional of the boundary data 0(u) for the elds (x). the right side is the generating
functional of correlators of the operator o(u) dual to 0(u). based upon the above

7

discussion, we know that the free classical solutions of scalar particle may be sugges-

tively written in terms of the boundary value 0(u) and a bulk-boundary propagator

ge

b(x, u).

then the cft correlators are given in terms of truncated bulk green functions as

ho(u1)o(u2)  o(um)icft = z m
yi=1

[dxige

b(xi, ui)]h(x1)(x2)   (xm)it .

(32)

to check our results, some sample calculations will now be carried out, in the approx-

imation of classical supergravity. consider an ads theory that contains a massless

scalar  with action

i() =

1

2zxx<1   z dn+1xggij 

xi


xj

.

(33)

using the bulk-boundary propagator ge

b(x, u), the solution of the laplace equation

in the ads space with boundary values 0 is

(x) =zuu=1   z du 

1  2xu + xx!n
1  xx

0(u) .

(34)

it follows that

(, u)



= 2n(12)n1zvv=1   z dv

0(v)

[(u  v)(u  v)]no(cid:16)(1  2)n+1(cid:17) ,

  1 .
(35)

by integrating by parts, one can express i() as a surface integral,

i() = (2a)n1nzuu=1   z duzvv=1   z dv

0(u)0(v)
|u  v|2n

.

(36)

hence the two points function of the operator o is proportional to |u  v|2n, as
expected for a eld o of conformal dimensional n.

4. we have discussed the euclidean version of ads/cft correspondence from

symmetry realization point of view and in terms of the poisson formula for the hyper-

sphere realization.

it is important to mention that there is another realization of

the symmetry transformations of the ads group, besides of (16). namely, the real

8

projective space realization of the ads space and the transformations of the ads group

on it.

in this realization, the global transformations are given by

x   =

1  bb(x  b)(1 + bb)

1  bx

,

(37)

where bb < 1 and

 =

1  1  bb
bb1  bb

,

1 + bb =

1

1  bb

.

the invariant dierential metric for this kind of transformations is of the form

d(i  )1d

1  

=

dx(i  xx)1dx

1  xx

.

at the boundary of the ads space x = u,  = v, we have duu = 0 and thus

dvdv =

1  bb
(1  bu)2

dudu .

the bulk-boundary propagator for this kind of symmetry is of the form

ge

b(x, u) =

n
2

(1  xx)
(1  ux)n

.

(38)

(39)

(40)

the invariant dierential of this kind of transformations, which is satised by the above

bulk-boundary propagator, is as follows:

n

xi=0

2
xixi 

n

xi,j=0

xixj 2

xixj  2

xi = 0 .

n

xi=0

(41)

at the boundary of the ads space, the transformation law for unit area elements is

dv =

n
2

(1  bb)
(1  bu)n

du .

after added of the transformations

 = x ,

 = i ,

(42)

(43)

which making the original point (x = 0) invariant, we complete this kind of realization

of the ads group. similar euclidean version of the ads/cft correspondence with

transformations (16) can be presented also.

9

what very interested here is that in this realization xi are what is called the beltrami

coordinates of the ads. for the non-euclidean version, the properties of the beltrami

coordinates of the ads spacetime have been discussed thoroughly [11, 12].

it has

been shown that for the ads spacetime the beltrami coordinates form an initial frame

in certain sense. and the equations of motion (4) for the classical free particle just

correspond to the rst integral of the geodesic equation of the beltrami metric.

in

other words, the special relativity with ads symmetry may be set up based on the

beltrami coordinates. solutions of the klein-gordon and dirac equation in the ads

space can also be given in a more straightforward way at the beltrami frame[13].

details about these subjects will be presented in a forthcoming paper.
