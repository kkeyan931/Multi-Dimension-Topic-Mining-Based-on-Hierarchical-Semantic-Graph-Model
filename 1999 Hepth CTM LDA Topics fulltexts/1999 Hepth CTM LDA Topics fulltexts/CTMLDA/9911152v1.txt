abstract

we generalize the local surface counterterm prescription suggested in ein-
stein gravity for higher derivative (hd) and weyl gravities. explicitly, the
surface counterterm is found for three- and ve-dimensional hd gravities. as
a result, the gravitational action for asymptotically ads spaces is nite and
gravitational energy-momentum tensor is well-dened. the holographic trace
anomaly for d2 and d4 boundary (gauge) qft dual to above hd gravity is
calculated from gravitational energy-momentum tensor. the calculation of
ads black hole mass in hd gravity is presented within above prescrition.
the comparison with the standard prescription (using reference spacetime)
is done.

1 introduction

one of the important achievements in ads/cft correspondence (for a gen-
eral review and list of references, see [1]) is related with the possibility to
make the the nite gravitational action and to nd the quasilocal stress
tensor in gravity using a local surface counterterm prescription [2]. with
such prescription one chooses the coordinate invariant functional of the in-
trinsic boundary geometry and adds it to gravitational action. as a result,
the equations of motion are not modied. however, the specic choice of
this functional (often called the surface counterterm) cancels the divergences
of gravitational action on the background under consideration. then, one
comes to well-dened expression for gravitational energy-momentum tensor
and action [2].

from the very beginning, the local counterterm prescription looks more
elegant than the standard prescription of subtraction of reference spacetime.
there, the action is regulated by restriction of spacetime to the interior of
some boundary geometry and then, by subtraction of (innite) gravitational
action of another (reference) background which has the same boundary [3].
clearly, the standard prescription is ambiguous as it depends from the choice
of reference spacetime. moreover, it is not always possible to select the neces-
sary reference background. very often the embedding of boundary geometry
in the reference spacetime may be done only approximately. nevertheless, in
many cases the standard prescription works and nite gravitational action is
obtained in the limit of innite boundary. the quasilocal stress tensor could
be then found by variation of nite gravitational action over surface metric
[4].

the local surface counterterms prescription [2] has been successfully
tested in asymptotically ads spacetimes. it reproduces correctly the mass
and angular momentum for various ads backgrounds. the results coincide
with the ones for same background (say, energy evaluation [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
using standard procedure. explicitly, the surface counterterms (nite poly-
nomials) for d  4, d  6, d  8 asymptotically ads spacetimes have been
found in refs.[2, 11, 12] respectively.
it is very interesting that such prescription has clear similarity (via
ads/cft correspondence) with usual counterterms prescription (renormal-
ization) in quantum eld theory. moreover, as it was shown in ref.[13](see
also ref.[14]) the local surface counterterm prescription admits the natural

2

continuation for asymptotically at spaces.

so far, the consideration of above prescription has been limited to einstein
gravity where the universal and widely accepted gibbons-hawking boundary
term [3] is known. the role of this term is to make the variational procedure
to be well-dened one.

it would be extremely interesting to test the universality of prescription
[2] applying it to another gravitational theories. the purpose of this work
is to formulate the local counterterm prescription for higher derivative (or
r2) gravity. as is known such theory is good alternative for einstein grav-
ity. moreover, it could be that higher derivative (hd) terms are relevant
only near planck scale as there may be mechanisms to make such hd terms
negligible at present stage of universe evolution. such theory is well studied
as perturbative qft (for a review, see [15]). hd gravity has better ultra-
violet properties than einstein one. from another side, hd gravity often
appears as low-energy eective action from string theory. hence, it may be
considered as stringy gravity. the important dierence of hd gravity from
einstein gravity is the fact that boundary term (analog of gibbons-hawking
term) is not only much more complicated but also there is no standard form
of such term accepted in the literature. the reason is that boundary term
also includes the hd terms. hence, it is quite dicult to make the varia-
tional procedure for hd gravity to be well-dened (unlike the case of einstein
gravity).

in the next section we discuss the boundary term in hd gravity and
in its special version (weyl or stringy) gravity. the local surface countert-
erm in such theories is explicitly found for d2 and d4 cases, i.e. when the
corresponding gravity theory (bulk) is formulated in three and ve dimen-
sions. comparison with the einstein gravity is made. as a result the nite
gravitational action for hd gravity is found as well as gravitational energy-
momentum tensor. from this as an explicit check we dene the holographic
conformal anomaly in d2 and d4 (via ads/cft correspondence). this con-
formal anomaly found from nite gravitational action in three and ve di-
mensions coincides with the previous calculation of holographic conformal
anomaly using other methods. in third section the calculation of ads black
hole mass is done for hd gravity. in this calculation the local surface coun-
terterm prescription is used. it is shown that the result coincides with the
corresponding calculation with the help of standard prescription. sometimes,
there may appear some nite dierence between the calculation in two dier-

3

ent prescriptions. this dierence is regarded as regularization dependence.
we show how one can make two dierent results coinciding by xing of some
arbitrary parameters in local surface counterterm for hd gravity.
in last
section the short summary is given.

2 surface counterterm and nite gravita-

tional action

in the present section we will dene the local surface counterterm for hd
gravity in three and ve dimensions. this will make the corresponding grav-
itational action for asymptotically ads spaces to be nite. we start with the
action:

s = zmd+1

dd+1xq g(cid:26)a r2 + b r r + c r r +

1
2

r  (cid:27) .

(1)

here md+1 is d + 1 dimensional manifold whose boundary is d dimensional
manifold md. the conventions of curvatures are given by

r = gr
r = 

 =

1
2



,  

, + 
 + 
g (g, + g,  g,) .





(2)

when a = b = c = 0, the action (1) becomes that of the einstein gravity:

s = zmd+1

dd+1xq g(cid:26) 1

2

r  (cid:27) .

if we choose

a =

2

d(d  1)

c ,

b = 

4
d  1

c ,

c = c

the hd part of action is given by the square of the weyl tensor c :

(3)

(4)

(5)

s = zmd+1

dd+1xq g(cid:26)c c c  +

1
2

r  (cid:27) .

the string theory dual to n = 2 superconformal eld theory is presumably
iib string on ads5  x5 [16] where x5 = s5/z2. (the n = 2 sp(n) theory

4

arises as the low-energy theory on the world volume on n d3-branes sitting
inside 8 d7-branes at an o7-brane). then in the absence of weyl term, 1
2
and  are given by

1
2 =

n 2
42 ,  = 

12n 2
42

.

(6)

this denes the bulk gravitational theory dual to suer ym theory with two
supersymmetries. the riemann curvature squared term in the above bulk
action may be deduced from heterotic string via heterotic-type i duality [17].
using eld redenition ambiguity [18] one can suppose that there exists the
scheme where r2
 in the same way as in ref.[19].
then, the action (3) is presumably the bulk action dual to n = 2 scft. in
[20], for the n = 2 theory with the gauge group sp(n), the usual uv weyl
anomaly via ads/cft correspondence is reproduced if
12n 2 + 12n  1

 may be modied to c 2

c =

2 =

the second equation in (7) is, however, not compatible with (6), where 1
2 =
n 2
42 . this might suggest that some sub-leading corrections to 1
2 and/or 
would be necessary. the explicit form of such sub-leading terms has been
dened in ref.[20]. we call the model corresponding to (5) as stringy gravity.

when a, b and c are given by

for d = 3, the r2 terms in (1) form the gauss-bonnet invariant g:

a = c = a ,

b = 4a

s = zmd+1

dd+1xq g(cid:26)a g +

1

r  (cid:27) .

the variation of the action (1) with respect to g is given by

s = smd+1 + smd

note that the terms containing g or gi vanish. the variation smd
contains the derivative of gij with respect to , which makes the variational
principle ill-dened. in order that the variational principle is well-dened on
the boundary, the variation of the action should be written in the form of

smd = lim

ddxqggij {  }
if we put {  } = 0 for {  } in (14),
after using the partial integration.
we could obtain the boundary condition. if the variation of the action on

0zmd

(14)

the boundary contains (gij), however, we cannot partially integrate it with
respect to  on the boundary to rewrite the variation in the form of (14) since
 is the coordinate expressing the direction perpendicular to the boundary.
therefore the minimum of the action is ambiguous. such a problem was
well studied in [3] for the einstein gravity (a = b = c = 0) and the boundary
term was added to the action, which cancels the variation :

sgh
b =

ddxqgdn .

in the coordinate choice (11), the action (15) has the form

sgh
b =

2 zmd

l

then the variation over the metric gij gives

from the other side, the surface terms in the variation of the bulk einstein
action (a = b = c = 0 in (13)) have the form

(18)

then we nd the terms containing (gij) in (17) and (18) are cancelled with
each other.

for hd gravity with the square of the scalar curvature and the square of

the weyl tensor c, where the action is given by

s = zmd+1

dd+1xq gna r2 + c c c o ,

the boundary terms were proposed in [21] as follows:

(19)

(20)

for general r2 gravity (1), if the curvatures would not contain (gij) nor
(gij), which appear in smd of (10), the boundary term would be given by

b = zmd

if we choose a  a + 2

terms for the action with the squares of the scalar curvature and the weyl
tensor correspond to the boundary action (20) in [21].
in the coordinate

here r and rij are scalar and the ricci curvatures given by gij in (11). we
should note that the curvatures contain (gij) and/or (gij). therefore the
variation of the curvatures in the surface terms in (21) or (22) induces new
terms containing (gij) and (gij). therefore we need to add more surface
terms to cancel them. it seems very dicult to cancel the terms containing
(gij). instead of (21), we choose sb by new parameters a, b, c and  in the
following form:

sb = s(1)

b + s(2)

here r is the scalar curvature on the boundary and is dened via gij in (11).
in (24), s(1)
is a generalization of (15) in einstein gravity and corresponds
to (21). we also need to add s(2)
(surface counterterm) which cancels the
divergence appearing in the limit of   0 in the action. the divergence
makes the energy-momentum tensor ill-dened. note that s(2)
is only given
in terms of the boundary quantities, which do not aect the variational prin-
ciple. if  = , the term corresponding to  2
 dn is the term found in [3].
if we choose a = a+ 2
d1 c, c = c as in weyl gravity (see eq.(4)),
the boundary terms correspond to (20). since it is dicult to determine the
coecients a, b, c and  by the variational principle in a closed form, we
determine the coecients a, b, c and  and also  and  simultaneously from
the condition of the cancellation of the divergences. if d  4, the terms in
(24) are enough to well-dene the variational principle in the asymptotically
ads background. as we dene these coecients from the condition of can-
cellation of the divergence, not only s(2)
b will be surface counterterm but also
part of surface counterterm will be included in s(1)
. it is dicult to divide
s(1)
to boundary term and surface counterterm (and such division even looks
unnatural as same terms with dierent coecients appear from both parts
of surface terms) so we keep this term mixed. the important thing will be
that it leads to nite gravitational action for asymptotically ads spaces.

especially the term proportional to gij

ciple of the holography, where only g(0)ij, which is the boundary value of the
metric tensor gij, should give the boundary condition but g(1)ij, which is the
rst order derivative of gij with respect to , should not do. if we treat g(1)ij
as dynamical variable, we obtain the equation g(0)ij = 0 from the variation
of g(1)ij, which is inconsistent.

the above equations seem not to be consistent with the result in [21], which

there are three independent parameters. if we choose a = b = c = 0, we nd

let us consider the holographic trace anomaly making the choice a = b =

it is nite. in order to control the logarithmically divergent terms in the bulk
action s, we choose d  2 =  < 0. then the total action s + sb has the

therefore only the leading term in (39) contributes to the trace anomaly
and gij
(0)g(1)ij term, which gives the contribution of o(), does not contribute.

which is identical with the result found in [22] where another method was
used. note that there comes the contribution only from the bulk action.
although the equations of motion make the contribution vanish in the bulk
but the additional contribution can appear from the surface due to the partial
integration.

we now consider d = 4 case. in this case we obtain,

s + sb = sln + nite terms .

(46)

as in d = 2 case, we use dimensional regularization putting d = 4 +  < 0.
eq.(41) can be solved with respect to g(1)ij just for d = 4 +  as follows

g(1)ij =

(51)

the above result in (51) coincides with that in [22]. from here it is easy to get
the holographic trace anomaly for weyl gravity. hence, we found the nite
gravitational action (for asymptotically ads spaces) in hd gravity in three

14

and ve dimensions by adding the local surface counterterm. this action
correctly reproduces of holographic trace anomaly for dual (gauge) theory in
d2 and d4. in principle, one can generalize all results for higher dimensions,
say, d6, etc. with the growth of dimension, the technical problems become
more and more complicated as the number of structures in boundary term
is increasing.

3 ads black hole mass

now using the local surface counterterm prescription and the counterterm
explicitly found in the previous section, we will nd ads black hole mass in
hd gravity.

when the metric of the reference spacetime (e.g. ads) has the following

form

ds2 = f (r)dr2  n 2(r)dt2 +

d1

xi,j=1

ijdxidxj ,

(52)

the mass m of the black hole like object is given by

m = z dd1xnttt(cid:16)ut(cid:17)2

.

(53)

here ttt is the dierence of the (t, t) component of the energy-momentum
tensor in the spacetime with black hole like object from that in the reference
spacetime and ut is the t component of the unit time-like vector normal to
the hypersurface given by t =constant.

first we consider the case of c = 0 in (1), where the schwarzschild anti-de

sitter black hole is the exact solution:

ds2

s-ads = e2dt2 + e2dr2 +

r2

e2 =

l2   krd2
d  2

+

d(d  1)rd  ! .

r2
l2

d1

xi=1

gijdxidxj

(54)

here l is given by solving (28) after putting c = 0 and gij is the metric of
d  1 dimensional einstein manifold, where the ricci tensor rij given by gij
is proportional to gij:
(55)

rij = kgij .

15

we now consider the d = 4 and k = 0 case which appears in the throat limit
of d3-brane. then the (t, t) component of the energy-momentum tensor in
(38) has the following form:

ttt =


2

gtt =



2  

r2
l2 +

r4
0

l2r2! .

(56)

note that the ricci tensor rij and the scalar curvature r in (38) vanish since
k = 0, which tells the boundary space is at. then we nd

ttt = ttt  t ads

tt =

r4
0
2l2r2 , t ads

tt = 

r2
2l2 .

for the reference ads metric, we nd
n =

r2
l2 .

then substituting (57) and (58) into (53), the mass m is

m =

r4
0

2l4 z d3x ,

(57)

(58)

(59)

which agrees with the result obtained by using the standard prescription in
[23]. especially, in the einstein gravity case a = b(= c) = 0, it reproduces
the standard prescription result in [24, 25]:

m =

3r4
0

l52 z d3x .

(60)

we now consider the weyl gravity (5). in this model, ads is the exact
solution and from (28) we nd its radius is identical with that of the einstein
gravity:

l2 = 

12
2 .

(61)

the schwarzschild-ads (s-ads) solution is not, however, the exact solution
of the system. assuming c is small, we can solve s-ads type solution per-
turbatively :

e2 =

l2

r2  1 

r4
0
r4 + 2

r8
0

r8!

 

c2
l2

.

16

(62)

here we make the coordinate choice as in (54) :

ds2 = e2dt2 + e2dr2 +

r2
l2

d1

xi=1

ijdxidxj .

(63)

as the dierence of the asymptotic behavior from that of the s-ads solution
in the einstein gravity appears only in the next-to-next order in 1
r4 , we can
evaluate the mass m in the way similar to c = 0 case in (59)

m =

r4
0

2l4 z d3x =

3r4
0

l52 z d3x .

(64)

in (64), the  (c) correction does not appear and the result does not seem to
agree with the standard prescription result in [23], where the mass (energy)
is given by

m =

(1 + 18)z d3x .

3 (t ) l3

(65)

(66)

here the temperature t is given by

therefore we obtain

(cid:19) .

m =

l52 (1 + 8)z d3x .

in (67), there appear  corrections in the next-to-leading order, which con-
ict with (65). this expresses the ambiguity in r2 gravity in the choice of
regularizations (standard prescription or local counterterm prescription) to
make the action to be nite. in fact, we have chosen a = b = c = 0 in eq.(36)
in order to x the ambiguities in eq.(34). for general case when a, b and c
do not vanish,  in (34) is shifted by a in (35). then we obtain, instead of
(64),

m =

r4
0

2l4 z d3x =

3r4
0

l52  1 

202

3l2 a!z d3x .

therefore the expression in (67) can be reproduced if we choose

202
3l2 a = 8



17

(68)

(69)

or using the expression for  in (62)

a = 

6
5

c .

then for general case with c 6= 0, it would be natural to choose

that is, in terms of  and  in (34) for d = 4,

a =

(72)
even if we choose a as in (71), of course, the previous results when c = 0 do
not change.

as a check, we consider a = b = 0 but c 6= 0 case. by the calculation

similar to the previous case of the square of the weyl tensor, we obtain

m =

r4

2l4 z d3x =

note that from (72),  is now given by

l2  1 +

(73)

(74)

the result in (73) agrees with the result obtained by using standard prescrip-
tion in [23]. in [23], the corresponding eq. is given by

v3 = z d3x .

(75)

here l is chosen to be unity: l = 1. since the temperature t is given by

we nd

t = r0(cid:16)1  2c2(cid:17) ,
2 (cid:16)1 + 4c2(cid:17) ,

3v3r4

m =

(77)

which is identical with (73) if we put l = 1.

hence, we showed how for general hd gravity by xing of unspecied
parameters of local surface counterterm to make the complete correspondence
between standard prescription and local surface counterterm prescription
(at least, in asymptotically ads spaces). one can now repeat the similar
calculation for another asymptotically ads spaces, like kerr-ads one, etc.

4 discussion

in summary, in this paper we constructed the local surface counterterm for
hd gravity and for weyl (stringy) gravity.
its coecients are dened for
general three- and ve-dimensional hd gravity. adding the local surface
counterterm to bulk action of hd gravity makes the complete gravitational
action to be nite (at least for asymptotically ads spaces). the gravitational
energy-momentum tensor is getting also to be well-dened. as a by-product
we obtain the holographic conformal anomaly corresponding to d2 and d4
dual boundary quantum eld theory (via ads/cft correspondence). this
result coincides with the previous calculation made by dierent method. the
calculation of ads black hole mass for hd gravity is made, using local surface
counterterm prescription. the corresponding mass (energy) for ads space
under consideration coincides with the standard prescription result.

hence, our results indicate to universality of local surface counterterm
prescription developed originally for einstein gravity. it is very interesting
to note that there are immediate directions on extension of our results. first
of all, one could consider higher dimensional versions (say seven-dimensional
gravity) and to construct the corresponding local surface counterterm and
nite gravitational action in this case. this may be useful in construction
(via ads/cft correspondence) of dual six-dimensional quantum eld theory
(or, at least in consideration of next-to-leading corrections in such theory).
second, we limited our discussion to asymptotically ads spaces. clearly, one
can generalize the local surface counterterm in hd gravity in the way indi-
cated in ref.[13] for einstein gravity in order to make the gravitational action
to be nite in asymptotically at (or other non-compact) spaces. third, hav-
ing the correct boundary term in hd gravity one may reconsider the circle
of problems related with the role of higher derivative gravitational terms to
early universe (for example, minisuperspace model). this will be considered
