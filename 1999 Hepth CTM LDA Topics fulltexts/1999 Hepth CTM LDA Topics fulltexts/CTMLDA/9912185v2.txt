abstract

it was shown by a. connes, m. douglas and a. schwarz that noncommutative
tori arise naturally in consideration of toroidal compactications of m(atrix) the-
ory. a similar analysis of toroidal z2 orbifolds leads to the algebra b that can
be dened as a crossed product of noncommutative torus and the group z2 . our
paper is devoted to the study of projective modules over b ( z2-equivariant pro-
jective modules over a noncommutative torus). we analyze the morita equivalence
(duality) for b algebras working out the two-dimensional case in detail.

introduction

our starting point is bfss (or ikkt) matrix model ([2], [1]). to compactify this model on
a d-dimensional torus t d in the bosonic sector of the theory one should solve the following

(1)
where r1, . . . , rd are radii of t d, ri = 0 for i > d. this equation does not have solutions
in nite-dimensional matrices. therefore, we consider xi as hermitian operators in hilbert
space e and ui as unitary operators (see [3]). it was shown in [6] that one can obtain an
interesting class of solutions to (1) where the operators u do not commute. it is natural to
assume that ui obey the relations

i xjui

1

ujuk = e2ijk ukuj .

(2)

then the space e along with the operators ui on it can be considered as a module over an
algebra of (smooth) functions on a noncommutative torus which we denote a; the operators
xi specify a connection in this module ([6]). we will restrict ourselves to projective modules
(i.e. direct summands in nitely generated free modules). then one can thoroughly analyze
compactications of matrix models on noncommutative tori (see [6] - [17] and references
therein). in the present paper we will consider compactications on toroidal orbifolds with
an emphasis on orbifolds of the form t d/z2 where z2 acts as a central symmetry z 7 z.
this symmetry should be implemented by a unitary (or antiunitary) operator w in e and
the conditions (1), (2) should be supplemented by the relations

 xi = w 1xiw , i = 1, . . . , d xi = w 1xiw , i = d + 1, . . . , 9 .

(3)
a straightforward calculation shows that the quantities w 2, uiw uiw , (i = 1, . . . , d)

commute with all xjs. it is natural then to set them to be constants

w 2 = c = 1 , ujw ujw = e2ij .

redening the elds w 7 w c1/2, uj 7 ujeij c1/2 we get the following set of relations

ukuju 1

k u 1

j = e2ikj , w uiw = u 1

, w 2 = 1 .

(4)

note that now the operator w is chosen to be unitary. the conditions (4) mean that the
space e can be considered as a module over a crossed product b  a  z2 (see section 2
for a more thorough explanation). formulas (1), (3) (for i = 1, . . . , d) should be considered
as a denition of a b-connection.

more generally one can consider a toroidal orbifold t d/g where g is a nite group of
linear transformations (we should assume that t d = rd/l and g transforms a lattice l into
itself). if the form  is g invariant then g can be considered as an automorphism group of
the noncommutative torus t and it is possible to consider the crossed product of t and g
(or twisted crossed product if we allow central extensions [18], [19]). if rij(g) are matrices
representing the group elements g  g on l, then in addition to (1) one has the following
bosonic and fermionic quotient conditions dening the matrix theory on t d/g

rij(g)xj = w 1(g)xiw (g)

(g) = w 1(g)w (g)

where (g) is the matrix of spinor representation of g satisfying (g)i(g) = rij(g)j.
in this paper our attention is concentrated on two-dimensional noncommutative toroidal z2
orbifolds. this is not a particularly interesting example as far as physics is concerned, for
one reason because the supersymmetry is broken completely. however some of our results
are valid (and are formulated) in any dimension. other results in dimensions d > 2 can be
deduced from d = 2 results we obtained.

the d0 particles on the commutative orbifold t 4/z2 were studied in papers [4] and [5].
in the present paper we work in the framework of noncommutative geometry. however some

2

of our results are new also in the commutative case. we show how one can construct modules
corresponding to a general action of the gauge group on chan-paton labels describing various
systems of branes wrapped on our noncommutative orbifold as well as branes sitting at
the orbifold singularities (these words concerning interpretation should be understood in
quotation marks as there are no points or geometric cycles in noncommutative geometry).

the paper is organized as follows. section 2 contains a general description of modules
over b algebras. we discuss k-theory of b in section 3.
it was shown in [7] that for
the case of noncommutative tori the duality group is generated by the relation of morita
equivalence and coincides with the t-duality group so(d, d|z). in section 4 we show how
the constructions of [7] can be extended to the algebras b. in sections 5 and 6 we turn to
the detailed study of the two dimensional case. in section 5 we calculate explicitly the b
k-theoretic invariants of modules over two-dimensional orbifolds. we use these results to
calculate the (d = 2) duality group in section 6. the duality group we obtained is isomorphic
to a semidirect product of the group so(2, 2|z) with a nite group. this nite group leaves
the chern numbers intact but acts on the other k-theoretic invariants in a nontrivial way.
an explicit representation of the duality group in terms of generators and relations is given
in the appendix.

2 modules

let us consider an algebra a of smooth functions on a d-dimensional noncommutative torus.
we dene a as an associative algebra of formal expressions

where un satisfy the relations

cnun

xn

un1un2 = un1+n2ei<n1n2>

(5)

and cn tends to zero faster than any power of |n| as n tends to innity. here n runs over
a lattice d = zd which we assume to be embedded in rd and  is an antisymmetric d  d
matrix. the algebra a is equipped with an involution * transforming un to un. note
that for  = 0 this algebra is isomorphic to the algebra of smooth functions on the standard
(commutative) d-dimensional torus. one can say that we consider a smooth part of a
c -algebra t with unitary generators uk, k = 1, . . . , d obeying ukul = e2ikluluk. a map
w : a  a transforming un to un can be extended to an automorphism of the algebra
a which we also denote by w. it is called a ip automorphism. the algebra b is dened
as a crossed product a w z2.
in other words b is dened as an involutive algebra of
formal linear combinations a0 + a1w where a0, a1  a and the operations with the symbol
w are governed by the relations w  = w , w 2 = 1, w aw 1 = w(a). this means that the
multiplication in b is specied by the formula

(a0 + a1w )(a

0 + a

1w ) = (a0a

0 + a1w(a

1)) + (a0a

1 + a1w(a

1))w .

3

all algebras we are interested in are equipped with a trace coming from the standard

trace  on a noncommutative torus: (pn cnun) = c0. this trace which we denote  is

dened by the formula

 (a0 + a1w ) = (a0) .

(6)

one can prove that this is the only bounded trace on these algebras.
it is important to
notice however that there are new unbounded traces on the algebra b. they can be dened
by means of the following functionals   1,...,d on a:

(un) =

d

(1)ini .

yi=1

(7)

here each i takes values 0 or 1 that gives us 2d functionals.. these functionals extended to
a by linearity satisfy the identity

we obtain new 2d unbounded traces  on b by setting

(ab) = (w(b)w(a)) .

(a0 + a1w ) = 2(a1) .

(8)

the factor of two here is inserted for normalization purposes that will be discussed in the next
section. note that in the commutative situation when  = 0 and un = einx the functional
 is nothing but the functional evaluating the value at the xed point (1, . . . , d).

it is easy to see that a b-module can be described as an a-module e with a unitary
operator w acting on it and satisfying w  = w , w 2 = 1, w aw 1 = w(a). here we use
the same notation a for an element of a and for the corresponding operator acting on e.
it is well known (see [22]) that a b-module is projective if and only if the corresponding
a-module is projective. let us construct some examples of b-modules. consider a as
a right a-module (one-dimensional free module). it can be equipped with an operator w
dened by the formula w (a) = ukw(a) where k  zd is xed. one can show that the
modules corresponding to vectors k and k such that ki = k
i (mod 2) are isomorphic. thus,
without loss of generality we can assume that the coordinates ki take values 0, 1 a equipped
with the operator w just dened can be considered as a b-module that will be denoted by
ak
 . in the commutative d = 4 case these modules were considered in [4] under the name
representation ii.

another class of examples of b-modules comes from a generalization of the previous
construction to the heisenberg modules studied for the case of noncommutative tori in [23].
let us remind the construction of heisenberg modules. let g be a direct sum of rk and an
abelian nitely generated group, and let g be its dual group (the group of characters). in the
most general situation g = rp  zq  f where f is a nite group. then g = rp  t q  f .
consider a linear space s(g) of functions on g decreasing at innity faster than any power.
we dene operators u(,) : s(g)  s(g) labelled by a pair (, )  g g acting as follows

(u(,)f )(x) = f (x + )(x) .

(9)

4

one can check that the operators u(,) satisfy the commutation relations

u(,)u(,) = ()1()u(,)u(,) .

(10)

if (, ) run over a d-dimensional lattice   g  g (i.e.  is a discrete subgroup such that
g  g/ is compact) then formula (9) denes a projective module over a d-dimensional
noncommutative torus a with

exp(2iij) = i(j)1

j (i)

(11)

for a given basis (i, i) of the lattice . note that in the decomposition of g above one
it is
has 2p + q = d. this a-module is called a heisenberg module and denoted e.
more convenient to introduce rescaled generators in e by the formula u(,) = u(,) ( 1
2),
(, )  . these generators satisfy in addition to (10)

u(, ) u(, ) = u(+,  )

(cid:18)1

2

(cid:19) 1(cid:18)1

2

(cid:19)

(12)

(cf. formula (5)).

endomorphisms of a heisenberg module e have a basis consisting of operators z(,) =
u(,1) with the pair (, ) belonging to the dual lattice , i.e. satisfying () = () for
any (, )  . again, it is convenient to introduce rescaled operators z(,) = u(,1).

if one denes an operator w0 : s(g)  s(g) according to (w0f )(x) = f (x), one obtains
a b module e,0. one can also obtain new b-modules replacing the operator w0 by an
operator w(,) = z(,)w0, (, )  . as one can easily check the heisenberg module e
along with the operator w(,) constitutes a b-module which we denote e,,.

3 k-theory

the k-groups of b were calculated in [21]: k0(b) = z32d1
, k1(b) = 0. one can
check that the projective modules we constructed above generate the group k0(b). let us
show how to obtain a complete set of invariants of an element of k0(b) (a complete set of
topological numbers of a projective module over b).

 where e is a projection in bn

every projective b-module e can be represented as a direct summand of a free b-module
bn
 . in other words e = ebn
 (i.e. e is an endomorphism such
that e = e, e2 = e). the traces  can be extended in a natural way to endomorphisms of
bn
 (i.e. to n  n matrices with entries from b). it follows from well known results that the
traces (e) do not depend on the choice of projection e. more precisely (e) is an invariant
of the k-theory class of the module e. another invariant of the k-theory class of a b-
module e is the element (e) characterizing its class in the k-group k0(a) = even(zd)
(see [23]). we will prove that the numbers (e) along with the element (e) characterize
completely the k-theory class of the module e. note that from the denition of the trace
(6) and the standard relation between (e) and the chern character constructed with a
help of  it follows that the representatives of k0(b) corresponding to (e) are elements
1/2(e)  1/2even(zd) rather then  itself. formally this is a question of normalization of

5

the trace. we will stick to the chosen normalization which implies 1/2 factors and denote
the corresponding invariant by . this normalization is consistent with the fractional branes
picture ([26], [4]).

 . it is easy to check that

let us calculate the invariants (e) in the case when e = ak
 = ekb where ek = 1

2(1 + ukw ). thus, we obtain that

ak

(ak

 ) = (1)1k1  . . .  (1)dkd .

(13)

the other invariant of these modules according to our normalization convention is  =
 (ek) = 1/2.

assigning to every projective module the numbers (e) and the element (e) we obtain
. it follows from formula (13) and from the known
. combining
we obtain that the homomorphism t is

a homomorphism t of k0(b) into r32d1
facts about k0(a) that the image of this homomorphism is a lattice in r32d1
this statement with the fact that k0(b) = z32d1
injective.

for the case of the two-dimensional orbifold one can describe k0(b) explicitly in terms
of generators. for d = 2 the invariant (e) is given by a pair of numbers (p(e), q(e)) 
(1/2z, 1/2z) related to the corresponding element in k0(a) in an obvious way. we can
dene a mapping t : k0(b)  r6 by means of a vector function

t (e) = (p(e), q(e); 00(e), 01(e), 10(e), 11(e)) .

(14)

it is proved by walters ([20]) that for d = 2 the image of t is the additive subgroup of r6
spanned by the vectors

(1/2, 0; 1, 1, 1, 1) , (1/2, 0; 1, 1, 1, 1) , (1/2, 0; 1, 1, 1, 1) , (1/2, 0; 1, 1, 1, 1)

(15)

(1, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0) ,

(0, 1/2; 2, 0, 0, 0) .

(16)

furthermore, walters proved that for irrational s the positive cone k +
0 (b) of k-theory
classes corresponding to modules is characterized by the property dime > 0. it seems that
a similar result should be correct for d > 2 and that one can prove it combining the results
of the present paper with the arguments used in [20]. the generators in (15) correspond to
the modules ak
 . the rst generator in (16) is a free module and the second generator can
be modeled on a heisenberg module as we will show in section 5.

let us discuss k-theory of commutative orbifolds. consider a compact manifold m and
a right action of a nite group g on it. the d-brane charges in iia string theory on m are
associated with the elements of the k-group k 0(m) = k0(c(m)). the d-brane charges of
the orbifold theory obtained by means of factorization of m with respect to g are related
to g-equivariant k-theory on m ([25]). for deniteness we will consider the complex k-
theory. (the case of d-branes in type ii theory is related to complex k-theory. in the type
i string theory we obtain a real k-theory.) the equivariant k-theory on m is equivalent to
k-theory of noncommutative algebra c(m)  g (a noncommutative c  algebra dened as a
crossed product of a commutative algebra c(m) of functions on m and the group g acting
on this algebra). the group k(c(m)  g)  c can be expressed in homological terms.

6

multiplication by c means that we disregard nite order elements in the k-group. for the
standard k-theory there exists a map

ch : k 0(x) z q  yjn

h 2j(x; q)

(17)

given by the chern character. to dene an analogue of this map in the equivariant case one
should consider a kind of equivariant cohomology (delocalized equivariant cohomology)
h i
g(m). following [24] we will give a direct geometric denition of this cohomology. (it
can also be dened algebraically as cyclic cohomology of c(m)  g.) the denition can
be given in the following way. for    we dene x  as the set of points x  x obeying
x = x. let us dene x as a disjoint union x = x . one can construct an action
of the group  on x. (if x = x then (xg)(g1g) = xg. therefore, one can say that an
element g  g species a map from x  to x g1g.) the group h even
(x) can be dened as
the -invariant part of even-dimensional cohomology of x



h even



(x) = h even( x; c) = m

h even(x ; c)!

.

one can dene the equivariant chern character

ch : k 0

(x)  h even



(x)

(18)

and prove that this character induces an isomorphism between k 0
(x)  c and h even
(x).
the denition of ch can be given in the following way. we represent an element of k 0
(x)
as a -equivariant vector bundle e over x. this means that an element g   acts on e
dening a linear map of a ber over x  x into a ber over xg  x. in particular if x  x 
then the ber ex over x is mapped into ex itself by :



 : ex  ex ,

x  x  .

let 1, 2, . . . , s be the set of distinct eigenvalues of this linear transformation. then, we
have a direct sum decomposition into eigenspaces: ex = e1
x. at the level of
vector bundles one has e|x  = e1e2. . .es. the element  acts on ei by multiplication
by i. following [24] we dene ch

(e)  h even(x ; c) by

x  e2

x  . . .  es

s

ch

(e) =

ich(ei)

(19)

xi=1

where ch(ei) is the ordinary (non-equivariant) chern character of ei. then the equivariant
chern character (18) is dened as the direct sum

ch(e) =m

ch

(e) .

let us illustrate this construction in the case when x = t d and g = z2 = {0

acts as x 7 x.

, 1
} where

and x  contains 2d points

in this case x  is equal to t d for  = 0

. we see that h even( x) consists of even-dimensional cohomology of t d and of 2d
for  = 1

summands h 0(pt; c) = c. all elements of h even( x) are z2-invariant. therefore, h even
(t d)
has the dimension 2d1 + 2d = 3  2d1. one can prove that the k-group at hand has no
torsion and therefore



k 0

z2(t d) = k0(c(t d)  z2) = z32d1

.

this agrees with the k-group for noncommutative toroidal orbifold we considered. this is
not surprising because the k-group being a discrete object usually does not change under
continuous variations of parameters. in all above considerations we talked about the group
k 0. however one can prove corresponding statements for the group k 1 and cohomology
groups h odd. in particular h odd

z2 (t d) = 0. this agrees with the fact that k 1

z2(t d) = 0.

one can relate the chern character ch in the case at hand with invariants (e). this can
be done in the following way. we dened above the (e)-invariants in terms of a projector
e acting on a free module bn
 . to realize the b-module e as a a module equipped with
the action of w we map bn
 to a2n
 by (fi + w gi) 7 (fi, gi+n ) , i = 1, . . . n , fi, gi  a.
the projector e then is represented as a block 2n  2n matrix of the form

and the operator w acts on a2n

 as

e =(cid:18) a

w(b) w(a) (cid:19)

b

w =(cid:18) 0 1

1 0 (cid:19)  w .

(20)

(21)

the projector e commutes with w . therefore, w descends to an operator w on the
 . from (20) and the denition of  (8) one immediately sees that (e) =

a-module ea2n
2tr(b) where tr denotes the matrix trace. furthermore from (20) and (21) we have

ew =(cid:18) b

w(a) w(b) (cid:19)  w .

a

as was already noted, in the commutative case, the functional  corresponds to evaluation
at the xed point (1, . . . , d). the operator w acts on a function f (x) on the torus by a
reection f (x) 7 f (x) leaving the values at xed points unaltered. hence, when restricting
the operator in the last formula to a ber above a xed point the operator w can be dropped.
combining everything together we obtain

 ()(e) = 2tr(b) = tr(ew )|(1,...,d) = tr w |(1,...,d)

(22)

thus, indeed, in the commutative case the invariants (e) correspond to characters of the
orbifold group representations on the bers over xed points in accordance with (19). it
follows then that these invariants are integer valued in the commutative case (note that the
normalization factor of 2 in (8) is necessary for the integrality). for the noncommutative
two-dimensional toroidal z2 orbifold it was proved in [20] that the invariants (e) are integer
valued. one can also prove the integrality of (e) in the noncommutative situation in any
dimension. let us sketch the proof of this fact here. first, consider the case of rational .

8

then the algebra a is morita equivalent to the algebra c(t d) of functions on a commutative
torus t d. this means that there exists such a vector bundle over t d (a projective module over
c(t d)) that a can be considered as an algebra of endomorphisms of this bundle (module).
the ip automorphism w of the algebra a can be realized as an involution of the bundle,
i.e. as an involutive transformation of the total space of the bundle that covers the standard
involution on t d. using this realization of a we can obtain a generalization of formula (22)
to the case at hand. this allows us to conclude that for rational s as in the commutative
case (e) is an integer. in order to analyze the case of irrational s we can use the fact
that there exist families of projective modules continuously (even smoothly) depending on
. as we just proved every module with a rational  in such a family has integer values of .
by continuity this property extends to irrational s. there are suciently many families of
this kind to prove that  is an integer for any projective module (we can use the fact that
the k-group is spanned by heisenberg modules that depend on  in a continuous way in a
proper range of ).

4 morita equivalence

in this section we will show how morita equivalences known for noncommutative tori can be
extended to noncommutative z2 orbifolds.

let a and a be two involutive associative algebras. a (a, a)-bimodule p is said to
establish a morita equivalence between a and a. this means that the projective bimodule
p obeys the conditions

p a p = a , p  a

(23)
where p is a ( a, a)-bimodule that is complex conjugated to p that means that p consists
of elements of p and multiplications are dened as a(e) := (e)a, (e)a := a(e) where
multiplications on the right hand sides are those dened for bimodule p . the algebras a
and a are said to be morita equivalent if such p satisfying (23) exists the bimodule p
determines a one to one correspondence between a-modules and a-modules by the rule

p = a

e = e a p , e = e  a

p .

for the case of noncommutative tori one can dene a notion of complete morita equiv-
alence ([7]) that allows one to transport connections between modules e and e. let us
remind here the basic denitions. let j, j = 1, . . . , d be a set of derivations of a specied
by their action on generators

jun = 2injun .

a connection on a projective module e over a can be dened as a set of operators i :
e  e satisfying a leibniz rule

i(ea) = (ie)a + e(ia)

for any e  e and any a  t. we say that (a, a) morita equivalence bimodule p
establishes a complete morita equivalence if it is endowed with operators p
i that determine
a constant curvature connection simultaneously with respect to a and a, i.e. satisfy

9

p
p
[p

i (ae) = ap
i (ea) = (p
i , p

j ] = ij  1 .

i e + (ia)e ,
i e)a + eia ,

(24)

here i and j are standard derivations on a and a respectively. sometimes for brevity
we will omit the word morita in the term (complete) morita equivalence bimodule. if p
is a complete (a, a) equivalence bimodule then there exists a correspondence between
connections on e and connections on e. an operator i  1 + 1  p
i on e c p descends
to a connection  on e = e a p . the curvatures of i and i are connected by the
formula f 

ij = f 

ij + 1ij.

given an (a, a) equivalence bimodule p we say that it gives a (b, b) equivalence if

it is endowed with an involution w p satisfying

w p aw p = w(a) , w p bw p = w(b)

(25)

for any a  a, b  a. recall that we introduced a notion of b connection on a b-module
e in the following way. let  be a connection on e considered as an a-module. then we
call it a b connection if it satises the additional condition w  = w . we say that
(a, a) complete equivalence bimodule p along with an operator w p satisfying (25) gives
a (b, b) complete equivalence if the connection p

 satises

w p p

 = p

 w p .

(26)

 , w p ) specifying a (b, b) complete equivalence it establishes a corre-
given a triple (p, p
spondence between b and b modules as well as between b and b connections on them.
namely, if e = e a p , the involution w in e determines an involution w = w  w p in
e, i.e. a b-module e generates a b-module e. it is straightforward to check that a b
connection in e induces a b connection in e.

if a triple (p, p

 , w p ) species a (b, b) complete equivalence and a triple (p , p 

 , w p )
species a (b, b) complete equivalence, then the tensor product p  = p b p  along
with the appropriate connection p 
and involution w p  determines (b, b) complete

equivalence. this means that we can consider a groupoid of equivalences.

notice that a pair (p, w p ) that gives a (b, b) equivalence is not a morita equivalence
(b, b)-bimodule in the sense of the general denition (it is not even a (b, b)-bimodule).
however one can construct a (b, b) morita equivalence bimodule p in the following way.
as a vector space p is a direct sum of two copies of p and a (b, b)-bimodule structure is
dened by the formulas

(p1, p2)b = (p1b, p2b) ,

a(p1, p2) = (ap1, w(a)p2) ,

(p1, p2) w = (w p p2, w p p1) , w (p1, p2) = (p2, p1)

where a  a, b  a. it is clear from the above consideration that every basic heisenberg
module gives a (b, b) complete equivalence. it has a unique (up to an overall sign) operator

5 modules in the two-dimensional case

in this section we will calculate the invariants (e) for a certain class of modules over a
two-dimensional toroidal z2-orbifold. for the purposes of calculating the duality group it
suces to have information about the modules ak
 and e, dened in section 2. the
invariants (ak
 ) are given by formula (13). in this section we will calculate the invariants
of the modules e,.

in two dimensions the k-theory class of a module e over a2

 is labeled by two topological
numbers (n, m) such that dime = n  m > 0. a module with the numbers n and m
relatively prime is called basic (see [9], [11]). for irrational  any module can be represented
as a direct sum of isomorphic basic modules. we dene a class of b-modules with an
underlying basic a-module by the following explicit formulas dening the action of the
generators on l2(r  zm)

(u1)j(x) = j1(cid:16)x 

(u2)j(x) = j(x)e2i(xjn/m)

+ (cid:17)

n
m

a  b
n  m

k2(cid:19) z k1

(27)

(28)

w j(x) = exp(cid:18)ik1

1 z k2

2 j(x) .

here j = 1, . . . , m is a zm-index and should be understood as a mod(m) equivalence class,
a and b are integers such that an  bm = 1 and the operators z1, z2 are generators of
endomorphisms dened by the formulas

1

(z1)j(x) = ja(cid:18)x 
(z2)j(x) = j(x)exp(2i(cid:18) x

m(cid:19)

n  m

m(cid:19)) .

(29)

the modules specied by (27), (28), (29) are a particular type of the modules e,, intro-
duced above. note that the components of the vector k matter only modulo 2 in the sense
that the corresponding modules are isomorphic.

we would like to calculate now the invariants  of these modules. as it was proved by
walters ([20]) for the two-dimensional case and as we argued above in general the invariants

11

(e) are integer valued. on the other hand the construction (27), (28), (29) of the module
depends on  in a continuous way provided n  m 6= 0. thus, we see that at least for the
modules with n > 0 we can reduce the calculation of en,m,k to the commutative case when
 = 0. in the commutative situation as it was explained above (e) coincides with the trace
of w evaluated at a xed point. to calculate this trace we nd a set of common eigenvectors
of u1 and u2, restrict w to a subspace of eigenvectors corresponding to each xed point and
calculate its trace. the result is given by the formula

(e) = trw |1,2 =

1
2

(1  (1)n)(1)k11+k22(1)bk1k2+m12 +

+(1 + (1)n)(1)ak1k2k2,1k1,2

(30)

where k1, k2 stand for the mod(2) classes. we must note here that the expression (30)
depends on the choice of integers a and b through the overall sign. this happens because
the generator w given in (28) is xed up to a sign. note that this sign factor is sensitive
to the parities of a and b only. to x the sign of w it is convenient to make the following
choice of the parities of a and b depending on the parities of n and m. we set a even and b
odd if n and m are both odd and a, b both odd otherwise. we denote these modules en,m,k.
with this convention we have

(en,m,k) =

(1  (1)n)(1)k11+k22(1)k1k2+m12 +

1
2
+(1 + (1)n)(1)k1k2k2,1k1,2 .

(31)

so far the above arguments prove the expression (30) to be applicable only for the case
when m and n are relatively prime and n > 0. if the second condition does not hold then
the module becomes virtual for  = 0. however we claim that the formula (31) also holds in
those cases. to perform a calculation we need to deform our module to a commutative one.
we do not necessarily have to go to  = 0 but to some other integer. we can choose   z in
such a way that dime = n  m > 0 and then perform a calculation. we have to be careful
though because modules over tori with  and  + l, l  z are identied in a nontrivial way.
namely a module with chern numbers (n, m) over a corresponds to a module characterized
by (n + m, m) over a+1.
it is not hard to nd the identication of invariants  that
corresponds to the shift  7  + 1. this shift induces an outer automorphism of a specied
by un 7 (1)n1n2un. it is a matter of a simple calculation to nd what happens to the
functionals (7) under this automorphism. they get transformed by a linear transformation


 =

1

2 x1,2=0,1

(1)(1+1)(2+2) .

(32)

it follows then from (8) and the fact that invariants (e) are traces of the corresponding
projectors that (e) transform by the same linear transformation. as an illustration let us
show how one can calculate the invariants (e) for the module e = en,m,k with n = 0,
m = 1, k = 0. such a module does exist for  < 0. we can rst go to  = 1 and
use formula (31) for n = 1, m = 1 and then apply transformation (32) to the result. the
calculation yields ((e0,1,0)) = (2, 0, 0, 0). the k-theory class of e0,1,0 is characterized by

12

t (e0,1,0) = (0, 1/2; 2, 0, 0, 0) and thus it represents a k-theory generator dened in (16). in
general one can show that formula (31) is applicable to any basic module over any a.

the calculation leading to formula (30) goes as follows. although we are interested in this
section in two dimensional tori only, for the future purposes we will give a formula for common
eigenvectors of ui that is valid for an arbitrary heisenberg module over (commutative) t d.
let e be a heisenberg module dened with a help of a lattice   g  g. an eigenvector
(x) (that does not lie in the l2 space, but is a generalized function) satises

u, = c(, ) .

as the operators u, form a commutative group we can construct a common eigenvector
out of any function 0(x) by the following averaging procedure

(x) = x(,)

( u(,)0)(x)(, 1)

(33)

where  is an arbitrary element of the dual group (g  g). as one readily checks the
corresponding eigenvalues are c(, ) = (, ). the dual group (g  g) can be identied
with the group g  g itself. thus, every character  is of the form

(, ) = ()1()

(34)
where (, )  g  g. evidently the eigenvalues c(, ) are in a one-to-one correspondence
with the points in g  g/ = t d as of course one should expect. any function 0 sub-
stituted into (33) gives a common eigenvector but most of the eigenvectors corresponding
to dierent 0s are linearly dependent. it is convenient to choose a set of 0s in the form
(i)
0 (x) = z(i,i)(x) where (x) is a delta function and (i, i) corresponds to a choice of
representative in /. since the operators z(,) commute with all u(,)s the index i corre-
sponds to vectors in the same eigenvalue subspace. however it still overcounts the solutions.
one can identify the correct degeneracy label when working with explicit constructions of
modules.

applying the formulas (33), (34) to the modules dened by (27) for  = 0 we obtain the

following expressions for the eigenvectors

,r

j (x) =xsz

(cid:16)x 

n
m

j  r  ns 

2

2(cid:17) eim/n1x

(35)

where r = 1, . . . , n labels the degeneracy, 0  i < 2. the corresponding eigenvalues of
u1 and u2 are ei1 and ei2 respectively. for any action of w on this module the subspace
of eigenfunctions corresponding to a xed point i = i, i = 0, 1 is invariant. one can
calculate now the trace of w dened by (28) (with  = 0) restricted to these subspaces. the
result is given by formula (30).

6 duality group

in this section we consider the d = 2 case. as we have seen in section 4 (b, b) equivalence
is generated by a (a, a) equivalence bimodule equipped with an involution w p obeying

13

(25). more precisely every bimodule of such a kind determines an isomorphism of k-groups
k(b) and k(b). we will construct a group that governs these isomorphisms (the duality
group). both of the k-groups k(b) and k(b) in the d = 2 case are isomorphic to z6.
their elements can be characterized by integers (n, m, 00(e), 01(e), 10(e), 11(e)) where
n = 2p(e), n = 2q(e) (see (14)).

let us formulate the answer we obtained. the whole duality group g is generated by
two subgroups each isomorphic to sl(2, z); we denote them by sl(2, z)m and sl(2, z)t .
the rst subgroup is just the modular group of the torus. in two dimensions it leaves the
parameter  and the invariants (n, m) unchanged but acts on (e) in the following way

(a ) =  at .

(36)

here a is a matrix from sl(2, z)m and a stands for the matrix with entries reduced modulo
2, such a matrix acts naturally on the vector space (z2)2 which the label  is an element of.
the second subgroup sl(2, z)t is generated by two transformations  and  that act on

the torus parameter  as

 :  7  + 1 ,

 :  7 

1


.

the action of these generators on the topological numbers reads as

 : (n, m) 7 (n  m, m)

 : (n, m) 7 (m, n) ,

(37)

(38)

(1)(1+1)(2+2)1,2 ,

 :  7

(1)12+121,2 .

2 x1,2=0,1

the whole duality group being restricted to the invariants (n, m) only, gives the fa-
miliar spinor representation of the group so(2, 2|z) isomorphic to the direct product of
sl(2, z)  sl(2, z) where the components correspond to the restrictions of the subgroups
sl(2, z)m and sl(2, z)t . in the whole duality group the elements of these subgroups do
not commute in general. however one can nd a new set of generators that generates a
subgroup isomorphic to so(2, 2|z). the duality group then is isomorphic to a semidirect
product so(2, 2|z)  h where h is a nite group that can be characterized as a central
extension of the group (z2)4. in other words there exists an exact triple

0  z2  h  (z2)4  0 .

we relegate the construction of this so(2, 2|z) subgroup and subgroup h to the appendix.
we now proceed to the description of morita equivalences and to computations. first,
there are (a, a) bimodules corresponding to the modular transformations of a torus. they
are constructed in the following way. to avoid confusion we will denote by u l
n the left action
of the rst torus generators and by u r
n the action of those of the second one acting on the
right. let r  sl(2, z). the bimodule er, consists of elements a  a and the action of
the tori is dened as follows

14

u l

n(a) = una ,

(a)u r

n = aur(n) .

(41)

with this denition the product er1, a er2, is isomorphic to er1r2,; a canonical iso-
morphism is specied by a  1 7 a. the bimodule ea, can be equipped with an operator
w p satisfying (25) and the connection p satisfying (24), (26) by the formulae

w p (a) = w(a) , p

i (a) = i(a)

(42)

where i is a standard dierentiation on a dened by jun = 2injun.
it is pretty
straightforward now to calculate from (41) the transformation of the functional  dened
by (7). it is easy to see from the structure of the bimodule that in the case at hand the
transformation law for the traces  is the same as the one for  and is given by (36). note
that in two dimensions modular transformations do not change the parameter . but in d
dimensions the matrix  transforms as  7 rtr, r  sl(d, z) and the described above
bimodules should be considered as (a, artr)-bimodules.

the (a, a+1)- bimodules corresponding to transformation  dened above consist of

elements a  a and the tori action reads

u l

n(a) = una ,

(a)u r

n = aun(1)n1n2 .

(43)

the operator w p and connection p are the same as the ones dened above by formula (42).
this morita equivalence corresponds to an outer automorphism that was already discussed
in the previous section. the corresponding transformation of the traces follows from the
transformation (32) of the functionals  induced by this automorphism. as a result we get
formula (39).

finally the equivalence bimodule realizing the transformation  is constructed as follows.
the (a, a1/)-equivalence bimodule e, is a heisenberg bimodule dened on l2(r) by
the formulae

(u l
(u l
(u r
(u r

1)(x) = (x + ) ,
2)(x) = (x)e2ix ,
1 )(x) = (x)e2ix/ ,
2 )(x) = (x  1) .

(44)

the above form of the bimodule can be deduced from the constructions of [8]. the operator
w p acts as w p (x) = (x) and the connection p is the standard constant curvature
connection constructed out of 
x and x operators ([23], [6]). in order to calculate the action
of  on  one can rst tensor this bimodule with any one of ak
 modules. the result
is the right heisenberg module dened in (44) equipped with an operator w given by a
formula analogous to (28). more precisely this module is isomorphic to the module e0,1,k
introduced above. let us denote this module ek = ak
 a e,. thus, using (13) and (30)
we can calculate the transformation of the invariants (e) in this case. furthermore one
can use the fact that 2 = 1 and thus calculate what happens with  when one applies  to
ek = e0,1,k. as it was explained in sections 3, 5 the modules ak
 , the rank one free module
and the heisenberg module e0,1,k generate the whole k-theory group. so the information

15

we have suces to deduce the transformation of  (e) for any module e. the result is given
by (40). this concludes the derivation of the duality group transformations corresponding
to elements of sl(2, z)m and sl(2, z)t subgroups. let us comment briey on the form of
the transformation (40). one can introduce a discrete (z2  z2) fourier transform

f() =

1

2 x(z2)2

ei(11+22)f ()

dened on functions on z2  z2. then  is just a combination of such a z2  z2 fourier
transform and a rotation by  that exchanges 1 with 2.

we are indebted to c. farsi, m. rieel and k. wendland for useful discussions.

appendix. duality group in terms of generators and relations

we proved in the main text of the paper that the whole duality group is generated by trans-
formations specied by (36) - (40). one may not be completely satised with this description
of the group. in this appendix we introduce more generators (that can be obtained from
commutators of the ones introduced above) and give a set of relations characterizing the
group.

in addition to the equivalence bimodules we described in the last section of the paper
there are also pairs (p, w p ) corresponding to automorphisms of b algebras that leave the
parameter  unchanged. however, when applied to modules this transformations relabel
the invariants (e). moreover the duality transformations corresponding to these automor-
phisms occur when one commutes the transformations from the subgroups sl(2, z)m and
sl(2, z)t . let us make here the following remark concerning ideology.
in general if we
consider an associative algebra a any automorphism of a generates a morita equivalence
bimodule. the internal automorphisms give rise to trivial equivalences. the external ones
may result in a nontrivial relabeling of the elements in k0(a) and should be included. in
the case at hand as we are not trying to study all possible morita equivalences but rather
extending the once known for tori, we consider only those additional bimodules that are
necessary for the group closure. for completeness let us give here a construction of these ad-
ditional bimodules. there are two types of them. the rst type comes from automorphisms
i : un 7 (1)niun. the bimodule ei, is modeled on a as follows

u l

n(a) = una ,

(a)u r

n = aun(1)ni ,

a  a

the operator w p is given by (42). the duality transformations i specied by ei, act on
 (for brevity we omit the argument in the notation of these invariants) as follows

1 :  7 1+1,2 ,

2 :  7 1,2+1 .

the bimodules of the second kind correspond to automorphisms of b given by

un 7 unei<nk> ,

w 7 w uk .

16

the equivalence bimodule is modeled on a:

u l

n(a) = una , (a)u r

n = aunei<nk> , w p (a) = w(a)uk .

it suces to take k = (1, 0) and k = (0, 1). we denote the corresponding bimodules e
i = 1, 2. the duality transformations 

i specied by e

i , are

i ,,

i :  7 (1)i .


there is one more bimodule ec, generated by the automorphism w 7 w . its con-
struction is obvious; in fact it reects a simple ambiguity in choosing w p in any equivalence
bimodule. the duality transformation c induced by ec, reects the overall sign of the
invariants . it is easy to equip these bimodules with connection p satisfying the right
properties.

one can describe now the full duality group in terms of generators

and relations which are easy to compute from (36) - (40):

using the relations above it is not hard to check that the subgroup generated by  =
 12c and  is isomorphic to sl(2, z) and commutes with the subgroup so(2, 2|z)m.
denote this subgroup sl(2, z) t . then the whole group is isomorphic to a semidirect product
so(2, 2|z)  h where so(2, 2|z) = sl(2, z)m  sl(2, z) t and h is a subgroup generated
i and c. the subgroup h is isomorphic to a central extension of (z2)4. the action
by i, 
of the so(2, 2|z) subgroup on h follows from the above commutation relations. reducing
entries of matrices from so(2, 2|z) modulo 2 we obtain a representation of this group on a
four-dimensional vector space (z2)4 over the nite eld z2. then the action of so(2, 2|z)
on h can be considered as an extension of this representation.
