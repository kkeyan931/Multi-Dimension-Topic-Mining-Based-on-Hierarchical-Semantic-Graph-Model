analytical approach to the transition to thermal

hopping in the thin- and thick-wall approximations

abstract

the nature of the transition from the quantum tunneling regime at low tempera-

tures to the thermal hopping regime at high temperatures is investigated analytically

in scalar eld theory. an analytical bounce solution is presented, which reproduces the

action in the thin-wall as well as thick-wall limits. the transition is rst order for the

case of a thin wall while for the thick wall case it is second order.

i. introduction

the decay of metastable states is a basic phenomenon of great generality with numerous

applications in a large number of contexts, ranging from the decay of the false vacuum

[1], e.g., in cosmology [2], to the creep-type motion of topological defects in solids [3]. at

a given temperature t the decay rate of a metastable state can be written in the form
 = aese (t )/h, with se(t ) being the euclidean action of the saddle-point conguration
(the bounce) and a being the prefactor determined by the associated uctuations. at zero

temperature, the decay is determined by quantum eects. with increasing temperature, the

nature of the decay changes from quantum to classical. the function se(t ) might either be
a smooth function of temperature or exhibit a kink with a discontinuity in its derivative at

some temperature tc. in the former case, the transition from the quantum tunneling regime
is said to be of second order while in the latter case it is said to be of rst order. the word

transition is appropriate as the crossovers have all the features of mean-eld phase transition

upon identifying the euclidean action with the free energy [4].

aeck [5] studied the phase transition at nonzero temperature for a quantum mechanical

problem. he argued that a second order transition from the quantum tunneling regime to

the thermal hopping regime takes place at some critical temperature. chudnovsky [6] and

garriga [7] have given criteria for determining when the transition is rst-order and when it

is second-order. there have been many studies on the order of the phase transition in the

context of condensed matter; for a recent work see [4]. on the other hand, there have been

very few studies in quantum eld theoretic situations.

a eld theoretic system, consisting of a single scalar eld with a  symmetry breaking

term, has been studied recently by ferrera [8] and also by us. we have also investigated
in detail the nature of the phase transition for single scalar eld theory with 3 symmetry

breaking [9]. our numerical results show that, for small values of the symmetry-breaking

coupling f , the transition from the quantum regime to the thermal hopping regime is rst-

order. we have argued that for large values of f the transition is second order. we have also

calculated the action analytically at zero temperature by assuming an appropriate ansatz

solution for the bounce. the result is in good agreement with the exact numerical result in

the thin-wall approximation (twa).

it is convenient to use the following form of the potential proposed by adams [10]

u() =

1

4  3 +


2

2 ,

(1)

where 0    2. any quartic potential can be reduced to this form by shifting and rescaling
of the eld. in this paper we extend our calculation of the action to nite temperatures and

study the nature of the transition. we propose a general ansatz at nite temperature in the
thin wall (  2) and thick wall (  0) limits. we nd that for a thin wall the transition is
rst-order while for thick wall it is second-order. this result is in agreement with ferrera[8]
who found that only for very large wall thickness (i.e.,   0.6) a second order transition
takes place, while for all other cases a rst order transition occurs. we would like to point

out that the analytical approach is very much easier than the numerical one and less time

consuming [9].

in sec.

ii we present our analytic calculation for the action at zero temperature and

high temperature, including some earlier work which is presented for completeness. in sec.

iii, we extend the calculations to nite temperatures and discuss the nature of the phase

transition. section iv contains our results for intermediate wall sizes. section v contains our

conclusions. the algebraic expressions for the integrals appearing in the analytic formalism

are given in the appendices a and b.

ii. analytical solution for zero and high

temperatures

we use the following potential (see [10] and [9]) to calculate the action analytically in two

extreme limits: the thin-wall and thick-wall limits

u() =

a. thin-wall limit at zero temperature:   2

we nd that an analytic solution for the bounce of the form of a fermi function:

(3)
where  = ~x2 +  2, r is the radius of the bubble and  its width, acts like a bounce in the
twa and leads to the correct value for s4, the action at zero temperature.

e(2r2)/2 + 1

 =



,

here the false minimum of the potential is at  = 0 and the true minimum lies between 2

(for  = 2) and 3 (for  = 0). the parameter  is approximately equal to the true minimum
in the thin wall approximation. the bounce has values  =  at  = 0 and 0 at   .
these boundary conditions are satised by eq. (3).

to evaluate , r, and , we substitute the ansatz (3) in the equation of motion :

d2

= 3  32 +  .

then the left-hand side (l.h.s.) and the right-hand side (r.h.s.) are respectively

we replace in eq. (5)

we now determine the parameters a, b, and d by demanding ds4/dr2 = ds4/d2 = ds4/d =
0. dierentiating eq. (12) and using eq. (10), we nd that, to leading order in 2/r2,

4b  2a  2d + 1 = 0 ,
3b  2a  d = 0 ,
3b  11a/6  d = 0 ,

(13)

which leads to a = 0, b = 1/2 and d = 3/2. using eq. (10), we can rewrite eq. (12) as :

s4 = 22 8r6

r2(cid:16)d  3b + 11a/6(cid:17)# ,

where the coecient of 4

with  given by eq. (16). we have then, for  = 1.9,  = 2.1, which implies that r2/2 =
2b/(  ) = 11. thus we have

while the action from the twa formula is ( see [10]) st w = 42
3 (10)3 for  = 1.9. the
departure from twa, s4/st w = 1.33, is in agreement with ref. [10]. the expressions seem
certainly valid for values of  in the range 2.0 to 1.8 .

b. thin-wall limit at high temperature:   2

the bounce takes the following form

 =



e(r2r2)/2 + 1

,

(19)

where r2 = ~x2 and the other parameters r and  have the same physical signicance in three
dimensions. the boundary conditions are  =  at r = 0 and  = 0 at r  , d/dr = 0
at r = 0. the equation of motion is

d2
dr2 +

dr

= 3  32 +  .

(20)

as in the earlier subsection, we substitute the ansatz bounce in the equation of motion and

assume the solution is constant except in a narrow region near the wall at r = r. the

resulting equations have a structure similar to that of eqs. (5) to (10).

after substituting the bounce eq. (19) in the action and integrating, we get the following

in terms of the parameters a, b and d, the action takes the simpler form

r2(cid:16)11

2

11
a + 9b  3d = 0 ,
2
2a + 3b  d = 0 ,

this leads to a = 0, b = 1/3 and d = 1.

hence the action in eq. (23) is reduced to

s3 =

which agrees with the twa formula and the expression of adams [10].

(25)

c. thick-wall limit at zero temperature:   0

the form of the bounce in eq. (3) suggests that the thick wall limit, which would corre-
spond to small values of r2/2, would be obtained by approximating the fermi function by

the maxwell-boltzmann function, which leads to a gaussian:

the action for this form of bounce is found to be

this yields the action

r4 =

for  = 0.1, r4 = 1.31, which agrees with adams result.

we nd the two expressions agree for 0 <  < 0.5.

s3 =

3/23/2(cid:16)1 +

(cid:17) .

(37)

following adams [10], we can calculate the ratio of this action to the thick-wall action and

we nd

r3 = 5.8283/2(cid:16)1  0.602   0.148 2 + 0.099 3(cid:17) ,

and this matches very well with adams result

r3 = 5.8643/2(cid:16)1  0.667  + 0.099 2(cid:17) .

(38)

(39)

we nd both compare well for values of  from 0 to 0.5.

thus, the form of the bounce given by eqs. (3) and (19) seems valid over the whole range

of  (from 0 to 2), and in the two extreme limits is amenable to analytic calculations. this

suggests that we look for an interpolating form valid at all temperatures that reduces to

eq. (3) at t = 0 and to eq. (19) at high temperatures.

we now determine the parameters a, b and d by demanding the vanishing of ds(t )/dr2,

with these expressions we calculate the values of a, b and d and also for the action s(t ).
in calculating s(t ) for   , the integrals ei4 are to be used (see appendix a). in these
cases  > 1, and we restrict the upper limit of the elliptic integrals to 1/ as they become

complex for larger values of .

one observation is the occurrence of a singularity in (ba) (which is directly proportional
to r) due to e0() becoming singular at  = 1 (i.e. at  = r). the values of s(t ) are
obtained and plotted for  = 1.9 and 1.85 as shown in figs. 1 and 2 respectively. the

temperature t ( = 1/t) is dened by [9]  = s4/s3. the transition point c can in
principle be dierent from , but in the twa they are equal [9]. in our result (figs. 1 and
2) we can readily determine  by extending the horizontal part of the curve to the left. for
fig. 2, for example, this yields   25, which is close to the value of c obtained numerically
as well as analytically [9]. we conclude, therefore, that the singularity at   45 in fig. 2 is
an artifact of the method, and does not represent the transition point. the phase transition

actually takes place at a much lower value of c, and is rst-order. we suggest that the same
prescription be used to determine the transition point for other values of  within the twa.

this means that the phase transition is rst order, which is consistent with the denitions

available in the literature (see, for example, [11]).

it can be shown that in the limit of zero temperature (i.e.   ), the action in eq. (52)
reduces to the action given by eq. (14), while at high temperature (i.e.   0), it reduces
to the one given by eq. (23).

b. thick-wall limit:   0

the form of the bounce in eq. (43) suggests that the thick wall limit, which would
correspond to small values of r2/2, would be obtained by approximating the fermi function

by the maxwell-boltzmann function, which leads to a gaussian:

(r,  ) = e(r2+

(53)

which satises the boundary conditions given by eq. (42).

for a given value of temperature (i.e. x) we can calculate b and d. hence  and  are

determined. thus we can calculate the action at dierent values of temperatures. figures 3

and 4 show the value of the action at dierent values of inverse of temperatures for  = 0.3

and  = 0.1 respectively. as we can see from the gure, the action goes smoothly from the

zero temperature regime to high temperature regime without any singularity at the transition

point. this means that in the thick-wall limit the transition is second order.

it can be show easily that in the limit of zero temperature (i.e. x  ), the action in
eq. (54) reduces to that in eq. (27). also we can recover the values of b and d, i.e., b = 9/8
and d = 1/2. in the limit of high temperatures (i.e. x  0), eq. (54) reduces to eq. (35)
and the values of b and d are recovered.

iv. results for intermediate wall sizes

the results in sec. ii and iii apply to situations where the bubble size r is large (twa)

or the bubble has no radius but only a (exponentially) decreasing wall. in this section we
consider expressions for the action with y = r2/2 a small quantity.

a. zero temperature

for the zero temperature or o(4) invariant bounce, an exact expression for the action

can be found and it can be approximated for large or small values of y. for small y we
have

s4 = 2224" 1

extremization with respect to  and  leads to a = 14.9924, b = 6.2335 and d = 1.5785
with values of  given by the equation

2  5.76  + 3.76 d = 0, 3.7 <  < 5.8, 0 <  < 2 .

(63)

the value of y for  = 0 is y  1.5 though the expression for the action is not valid as
now |y| > 1. interestingly, 3ey corresponds to the value of ( ) obtained in sec. ii.
as we expect the value of  to be 3 (value of  at the true minimum) it appears that the

limiting solution is of the form

 = 3 eye2/2

.

(64)

we see that y    0 for   1.2. the action calculated agrees with the action calculated
numerically by adams [10] in the region 1.2 <  < 1.4.

b. high temperature

in this case we start with the expression for small y given by

s3 = 43/223" 1

minimization leads to d = 1.588, b = 2.403, and a = 2.2857. again we nd the values
of y  0 for  = 1.25 and the expressions are valid between 1.1 <  < 1.4. thus we have
(semi) analytic expressions for the regions 0 <  < 0.5, 1.1 <  < 1.4 and 1.7 <  < 2.0.

v. conclusions

we now discuss the nature of the transition as we go from zero to high temperatures. in

quantum mechanics, denitive criteria for the continuity or discontinuity (corresponding to

second order and rst order respectively) in the derivative of the action have been obtained

by chudnovsky [6] and garriga [7]. it has further been shown that the lowest action at any

temperature is possessed by either the zero temperature or the high temperature solutions.

in quantum eld theory the situation seems to be dierent. both ferrera [8] and we

[9] nd that there is an interpolating solution which can be used to determine whether the

transition is rst order or second order (i.e. with or without a kink).

in sec. iii we nd that for a thin wall (  2) the interpolating solution has a singularity
at  = r. the expansion in terms of y breaks down at this point. so we do not expect a
real singularity at this point. however our numerical solutions (as well as those of ferrera)
show that a kink is present in the twa, showing that the transition is rst order. for   0
(thick wall) we nd that there is no kink and the transition is smooth (second order).

it seems, therefore, a reasonable conclusion that below  < 1.2 (y  0) we have a second
order transitions and the graph of the action against  is smooth. for  > 1.2 we have a

kink and the transition is rst order. thus for a potential with a  symmetry breaking and
coupling f = 0.75 corresponding to  = 0.65, ferrera nds a smooth transition. with a 3

symmetry breaking term and f = 0.75 corresponding to  = 1.46 (see table iii in our paper

[9]) we nd a kink. so by transforming the potential to the adams form and looking at the

resulting  we can predict whether there will be a rst or a second order transition.

it is suggested that our method could be used to study in detail the nature of the

phase transition in electroweak theory. such a study could be of importance in models of

electroweak baryogenesis and other phenomena in the early universe.
