(n) (d) obvious reasons, well convenience, refer conditions neumann dirichlet gluing conditions, re- spectively. terms modes, yield following (jan ja n)|bi = 0 , (jan + ja n)|bi = 0 . (n) (d) notice conditions opposite relative sign respect ones written {$9612148$} (see also {$9606112$}). discrepancy however related geometric interpretation gluing conditions, implied {$9812193$}, rather lies denition conserved currents one starts {$9606112$}. must said relative minus sign denition chiral currents (4) often neglected literature without major consequences; nevertheless, whenever relation holomorphic antiholomorphic sectors theory comes play, sign becomes crucial. 10 alternatively, write gluing conditions cylinder where, using mode expansion ja(w) = xnz jan enw , ja( w) = xnz jan en w , fact boundary w = w, obtain (ja(w) ja( w))|bi = 0 , (ja(w) + ja( w))|bi = 0 . (n) (d) consistency conditions case free theory yield case nontrivial restrictions type gluing conditions impose dierent directions. indeed, impose type gluing conditions two dierent directions, say b, must dirichlet gluing conditions directions c non-vanishing fab c since |bi = fab c(jc n+m + jc (n+m))|bi . particular, cannot impose neumann gluing conditions directions unless group abelian. moreover, |bi =fab c(jc n+m jc (n+m))|bi + 2knn+m,0 gab|bi , deduce dierent gluing conditions or- thogonal directions (that is, corresponding element gab vanishes), case must neumann conditions directions c non-vanishing fab c. open string. case nonabelian generalisation neu- mann dirichlet gluing conditions reads (ja(z) + ja(z))(cid:12)(cid:12)z=z = 0 , (ja(z) ja(z))(cid:12)(cid:12)z=z = 0 . modes obtain jan + jan = 0 , jan jan = 0 . (n) (d) (n) (d) finally, cylinder, boundary w = w, obtain following gluing conditions (ja(w) + ja( w))(cid:12)(cid:12)w= w = 0 , (ja(w) ja( w))(cid:12)(cid:12)w= w = 0 . (n) (d) remark open string picture consistency conditions constraining allowed gluing conditions. one however interested preserving ane symmetry bulk theory one must keep mind that, unlike case free open string, dirichlet gluing conditions preserve ane 11 algebra. words, want preserve current algebra, cannot impose neumann gluing conditions directions. concludes discussion generalisation standard neumann dirichlet gluing conditions group manifold case. consider general case, work open string picture. given string background described wzw model target space g consider following gluing conditions, implicitly evaluating sides condition boundary z = z j(z) = r j(z) , (7) r linear invertible map r : g g, r(ta) = tbrb a, ta g. basic requirement imposed r result- ing d-brane congurations conformally invariant. consistency condition imposes holomorphic antiholomorphic sectors agree boundary, t(z) = t(z) . using expression energy momentum tensor (6) obtain map r must preserve metric : rt r = . (8) remaining paper implicitly assume matrix gluing conditions r satises condition. 4. d-branes group manifolds open string sector one subtle issues approach extracting geo- metric information given set gluing conditions. precise statement problem following: given set gluing con- ditions (7) chiral currents xed otherwise arbitrary point g target group manifold g, nd possible d-branes pass g described gluing conditions. clearly desirable interpret boundary conditions group manifolds similar manner space case; all, special case g abelian space. however, spite fact gluing conditions (7) introduced non- abelian generalisation (3), important distinction them. case free theory gluing conditions formally identical boundary conditions dened tangent space target manifold; therefore corresponding eigenvalues eigen- vectors matrix r identify neumann dirichlet directions. group manifold case gluing conditions (7) take values tangent space g identity, teg g. due fact currents j j lie algebra valued objects. hence, order extract geometric information algebraic gluing conditions must rst translate 12 boundary conditions tgg, determine neumann dirichlet directions case. let us consider left- right-invariant maurercartan forms g, denote l, r. use maps g : g pull maurercartan forms back , thus obtaining gl = g1dg gr = dg g1, g-valued 1-forms is, belong 1() g. therefore see holomorphic current j(, ) = gg1 takes values (1,0) g, whereas antiholomorphic current j(, ) = g1 g takes values (0,1) g. order obtain lie algebra valued gluing condition (7) boundary condition taking values tgg, need translate chiral currents g tgg. done help two well-known maps, obtained left- right-translation group g (g) : g tgg , (g)x = gx , (g) : g tgg , (g)x = xg , send elements lie algebra tangent vectors point g. apply (g) sides gluing condition (7) obtain following boundary condition tgg: g = r(g) g , r(g) map r(g) : tgg tgg, dened r(g) = (g) r (g)1 . thus, given tangent vector v tgg, r(g)(v ) = r(g1v )g. first must remark that, contrast space case, matrix boundary conditions r(g) matrix gluing conditions r, former point- dependent. general, arbitrary group g, r agrees r identity (more generally, g centre). implies, particular, identication neumann dirichlet boundary conditions used {$9805006$} nd d-branes pass identity group manifold. safely identify neumann dirichlet directions. way space, determined eigen- values eigenvectors corresponding matrix boundary con- ditions, case r(g). given point g, dirichlet boundary condition corresponds 1 eigenvalue r(g), means directions normal worldvolume d-brane spanned corresponding eigenvectors r(g). eigenvalues describe neumann boundary conditions corresponding eigen- vectors span tangent space worldvolume d-brane. let us conclude section describing alternative way de- riving boundary conditions group manifolds, proves useful concrete applications. given particular group manifold g, parametrise introducing coordinates x , = 1, ..., dim g; also introduce left- right-invariant viel- beins dened g1dg = ea dx ta , dgg1 = ea dx ta . 13 vielbeins related ea b, denotes adjoint action group, gtag1 = ab atb. using set-up, one show gluing conditions (7) give rise following boundary conditions component elds x : = eb aa x = r(g) x . here, matrix boundary conditions r(g) given r(g) = e1re . (9) (10) neumann dirichlet directions identied similar way before. moreover, one see matrix describes boundary conditions given point target space depends point, case, invariant vielbeins. analysis far made use particular property map r may have. remaining notes concentrate two special classes gluing conditions, detailed analysis resulting d-brane congurations possible. 5. type-d gluing conditions dening property type gluing conditions fact map r taken lie algebra automorphism,  = r() .

(13) introduce new eld g = gr1, write corresponding boundary conditions following form g = adg1 g . using previous argument, applied time g, lead conclude corresponding d-brane conguration, described eld g, worldvolume lies along right translate cr conjugacy class g element r. result diers one obtained {$9812193$}, argued inner automorphisms, symmetries model, cannot result d- brane congurations dierent ones already described r = 1. although inner automorphisms symmetries string background, necessarily symmetries theory con- taining d-brane. fact constitute novelty, d-branes break bulk symmetries even space (e.g., translational symmetry). one remark order. one alternatively apply adr1 sides gluing condition (13) obtain, using similar argument, corresponding d-brane lies along left-translate rc conjugacy class g. since however cr = rc, lead ambiguity. interesting point conjugacy classes groups admit- ting bi-invariant metrics always even dimension. indeed, conju- gacy classes image exponential map adjoint orbits dieomorphic co-adjoint orbits. co-adjoint orbits, hand, symplectic manifolds relative natural kirillov kostantsouriau symplectic structure hence even-dimensional. therefore d-branes whose worldvolumes identied shifted conjugacy classes even-dimensional worldvolumes. turn case general automorphism. would like identify submanifold n g corresponds worldvolume d-brane described (12). provided metric g restricts 15 nondegenerately n, split tangent space tgg tangent space n orthogonal complement: tgg = tgn tgn . let us consider given otherwise arbitrary vector v tgn . saw previous section, vector v normal, point g, worldvolume d-brane eigenvector matrix r(g) corresponding eigenvalue equal 1. therefore satises r(g1v ) = v g1 , turn implies hr(g1v ) v g1, r(x)i = 0 , element x lie algebra. relation, using fact r preserves metric, well fact metric bi-invariant, deduce hv, r(x)g gxi = 0 . relation tells us vector wx r(x)g gx, belongs tgg, normal v , x. hence wx tangent n is, worldvolume d-brane. r = 1, wx would simply vector tangent conjugacy class c g. general, wx turns tangent twisted conjugacy class, dened follows (for details, see appendix) map r : g g dened cr = (cid:8)r(h)gh1 | h g(cid:9) , (14) small enough x element lie algebra. r(cid:0)etx(cid:1) = etr(x) , order see wx tangent cr consider curve cr r(t) = r(h(t))gh1(t) , dened terms particular curve h(t) g, characterised h(0) = 1 h(0) = x. curve passes g tangent vector g nothing wx = r(x)g gx . dx(t) dt (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0 hence lie algebra element x exists tangent vector wx d-brane, also tangent twisted conjugacy class cr g. could show tangent vector d-brane form wx, x g, would able conclude corresponding d-brane identied cr. 16 know tgn spanned dirichlet eigenvectors r(g). one rephrase saying vector v tgn belongs kernel following operator 1 (g) r (g)1 . therefore tgn, orthogonal complement tgn , noth- ing image adjoint operator given (cid:0)1 (g) r (g)1 (cid:1) = 1 (g) r (g)1 order obtain relation used fact (g) r (g)1 isometry therefore adjoint given inverse. implies vector w tgn written . w = u gr1(ug1) , vector u tgg. since, moreover, every vector u tgg satises ug1 = r(x), lie algebra element x, follows w = r(x)g gx, x. therefore conclude worldvolume d-brane identied twisted conjugacy class cr. assumed worldvolume d-brane forms submanifold n g. order check indeed case, one must show tangent vectors n satisfy frobenius integrability condition, is,  belongs tgn whenever w1(g) w2(g) do. compute bracket explicitly case obtain  = r()g g , used fact r automorphism. hence d-type gluing conditions always give rise d-branes submanifolds g. implies, particular, gluing conditions cannot describe congurations consisting intersecting d-branes. notice case necessarily obtain odd-dimensional d-branes, relation conjugacy classes co-adjoint or- bits endowed symplectic structure cannot generalised twisted case. fact, case, one nd explicit solutions describing even-dimensional d-branes {$9606112$}. 6. type-n gluing conditions particular type gluing conditions discussed pre- vious section sense natural, preserves current algebra bulk theory, certainly general. section consider dierent type gluing conditions dened terms lie algebra automorphism (11). case, 17 however, thought generalisation neumann gluing conditions, dened follows ja(z) + rb jb(z) = 0 . (15) coecients rb are, before, matrix elements map r, r(ta) = tbrb a, ta g. notice here, although holomorphic antiholomorphic sectors related met- ric preserving automorphism, innite-dimensional symmetry current algebra preserved, contrary statement made {$9805006$}. case yet understand general picture possi- ble d-brane congurations one obtain. reason, restrict considering concrete example, case group g = su(2). convenient choose parametrisation su(2) g = e2t2e1t1e3t3 , (16) 1, 2, 3 play role spacetime elds, {t1, t2, t3} forms basis su(2), brackets  = abctc. left- right-invariant vielbeins read e = cos 3 sin 3 0 cos 1 sin 3 0 cos 1 cos 3 0 1 sin 1 , e = cos 2 0 0 cos 1 sin 2 1 sin 1 sin 2 0 cos 1 cos 2 . notice, rst all, parametrisation singular whenever cos 1 = 0. one fact show singular points give rise two s1s inside s3, described g2(/2, 2, 3) = e/2y1e(32)y3 . let us start simplest case, r = 1, gluing conditions read j(z) = j (z) . (17) case thought nonabelian generalisation space case neumann boundary conditions directions. well-known, space case one obtains d-branes whose worldvolume lls whole target; possible d-branes described boundary conditions (17) give rise to, namely = r(g) , (18) r(g) = e1e. evaluate matrix boundary conditions identity obtain r(1) = 1, indicates three +1 eigenvalues hence three neumann directions spanning su(2). words, identity su(2) belongs euclidean d-brane three-dimensional worldvolume. soon move away identity, r longer 1. general, r 18 one +1 two complex conjugate eigenvalues. therefore, generic points group manifold, 1 eigenvalues thus dirichlet directions. nevertheless, exist submanifolds su(2) r least one -1 eigenvalue; fact, since det r = 1, necessarily two eigenvalues. submanifolds described zero locus function, f (g) tr r(g) + 1; parametrisation given f = 1 + cos 1 cos 2 + cos 2 cos 3 + cos 3 cos 1 + sin 1 sin 2 sin 3 . let us denote f zero locus f . since every point f characterised one +1 two 1 eigenvalues r, follows every point f passes euclidean d-particle, tangent vector worldline eigenvector r corresponding +1 eigenvalue. two natural questions arise. first, would like better geometric understanding surface f. second, determine whether particular solutions consistent; words must make sure worldlines lie surface f. order answer rst question consider vector elds generate adjoint action group g. shown appendix, vector elds written terms right- left-invariant vielbeins follows ha(g) = (cid:0)(e1) (e1) a(cid:1) , = 1, 2, 3. (19) straightforward calculation check that, case, f annihilated corresponding vector elds ha ha(g) f (g) = 0 , = 1, 2, 3. shows f class function su(2), f (hgh1) = f (g), group elements g h. conclude zero locus f consists adjoint orbitsthat is, conjugacy classes. let us turn second question. since r takes 1 eigen- values surface f, means solution describing d-particle worldline lie surface. order check indeed case must show vector tangent worldline also tangent f. compute explicitly neumann eigenvector v1 r, easily check v1(g) f (g)|f (g)=0 = 0 . words, v1 tangent zero locus f , f. let us summarise ndings far. seen gluing conditions (17) give rise two types euclidean d-branes. around identity d2-brane extends surface dened 19 zero locus class function. moreover, surface foliated worldlines d-particles. let us consider gluing conditions (15) arbitrary r. since su(2) simple lie algebra, r inner automorphism; hence identied adr, group element r. following type argument case d-type gluing conditions, one show also case eect inner automorphism level gluing conditions translation group manifold. indeed, matrix boundary conditions r = e1re gives rise three neumann eigenvectors everywhere except submanifold denote fr. submanifold identied zero locus function fr(g) = tr r(g) + 1. clearly, function related previous f , satises fr(g) = f (gr1) . therefore fr nothing translation f group element r, fr = fr. hence every point fr passes d-particle whose worldline lies fr. moreover, surfaces f fr related translation, neumann eigenvectors tangent worldlines corresponding d-particles surfaces. particularly interesting case one r two 1 eigenvalues. case, corresponding surface fr passes identity element su(2); therefore exists particular d- particle whose worldline passes identity. tangent vector, identity, simply given v1 = 3, expected. worldline d-particle nothing subgroup su(2) generated t3. moreover, translation particular solution gives rise d-particle congurations whose worldlines cosets su(2). 7. conclusions outlook paper analysed geometric interpretation d- branes group manifolds obtained via boundary state formalism. although algebraic analysis possible gluing conditions quantum, subsequent analysis geometry resulting d- branes essentially classical.
