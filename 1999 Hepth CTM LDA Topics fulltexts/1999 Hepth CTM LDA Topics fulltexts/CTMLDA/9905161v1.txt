abstract

the usual t-duality that relates the type iia and iib theories compactied on circles

of inversely-related radii does not operate if the dimensional reduction is performed on the

time direction rather than a spatial one. this observation led to the recent proposal that

there might exist two further ten-dimensional theories, namely type iia and type iib,

related to type iib and type iia respectively by a timelike dimensional reduction. in this

paper we explore such dimensional reductions in cases where time is the coordinate of a

non-trivial u (1) bre bundle. we focus in particular on situations where there is an odd-

n

dimensional anti-de sitter spacetime ads2n+1, which can be described as a u (1) bundle over
, a non-compact version of cp n corresponding to the coset manifold su (n, 1)/u (n).
in particular, we study the ads5  s5 and ads7  s4 solutions of type iib supergravity and

gcp

eleven-dimensional supergravity. applying a timelike hopf t-duality transformation to the
 s1  s5. we

former provides a new solution of the type iia theory, of the form gcp

show how the hopf-reduced solutions provide further examples of supersymmetry without

2

supersymmetry. we also present a detailed discussion of the geometrical structure of the

hopf-bred metric on ads2n+1, and its relation to the horospherical metric that arises in

the ads/cft correspondence.

introduction

the duality symmetries of string theory and m-theory have been studied from a variety

of viewpoints, in order to elucidate the interconnections between theories once thought to

be distinct. the duality relations can be either at the perturbative level, as in the case of

the t-duality that relates the type iia and iib string theories compactied on circles of

inversely-related radius [1, 2], or non-perturbative, as in the strong-coupling limit of the

type iia string leading to the opening out of an eleventh dimension [3, 4].

in the case of a non-perturbative duality, the relation is necessarily non-perturbative,

and strictly speaking can be regarded only as conjectural at the present time. consequently,

it is of interest to accumulate a body of evidence that supports the duality conjecture. one

of the most useful tools in this regard has been the study of bps-saturated solutions to

the low-energy eective actions, which may be interpreted as solitonic states in the non-

perturbative spectra of the theories (see, for example, [5]).

one of the commonly-employed techniques for uncovering the web of interrelations be-

tween the various theories is to study the spectrum of solutions corresponding to branes

wrapped around non-trivial cycles in an internal compactifying manifold. the simplest

such manifolds are tori. in this procedure, otherwise known as diagonal dimensional reduc-

tion, a p-brane in d spacetime dimensions wrapped around an n-dimensional torus reduces

to a (p  n)-brane in d  n dimensions. another possible reduction procedure involves rst

preparing a periodic array of p-branes in d dimensions, so that from a large-distance stand-

point the p-brane is eectively smeared uniformly over an n-dimensional submanifold of

its (d  p  1)-dimensional transverse space. these dimensions eectively correspond to

killing directions in the transverse space, and can then be wrapped around the n-torus.

this procedure, in which the p-brane retains its spatial dimension p, while the spacetime

dimension is again reduced from d to d  n, is known as vertical dimensional reduction.

one can also, of course, consider situations where the reduction on the n-torus is a mixture

of diagonal and vertical dimensional reduction steps.

another kind of reduction on a circle is also possible, in certain cases. the space

transverse to a p-brane can be described in terms of hyperspherical polar coordinates, with

a radial coordinate r and angular coordinates on the foliating spheres. if the transverse

space is even-dimensional, these spheres will be odd-dimensional, and then we can exploit
the fact that the sphere s2n+1 can be described as a u (1) bundle over cp n. the coordinate

 on the u (1) bre is a killing direction, and the killing vector / is of constant length
in the sphere metric. it thus provides a suitable coordinate for an s1 dimensional reduction.

2

this reduction mechanism, known as hopf reduction [6, 7, 8], has been studied in a variety

of contexts. it is akin to a vertical dimensional reduction, in that it is the dimension of

the transverse space that is reduced. however, it is quite dierent from the usual vertical

reduction in that / is a killing direction even for a single isotropic p-brane.

in certain cases, such as the d3-brane of the type iib theory, an important phenomenon

is that as the horizon of the brane is approached, the spacetime geometry more and more

nearly approaches the product of an anti-de sitter (ads) spacetime and a sphere. speci-

cally, the sphere corresponds to the foliating spheres of the transverse space, while the ads

spacetime is described in terms of foliating surfaces that are formed by the p-brane world-

volume with the original radial coordinate r now parameterising this sequence of spacetime
foliations. in the case of the d3-brane, the near-horizon geometry is therefore ads5  s5.

the description of ads as a foliation of at minkowski spacetime surfaces is known as the

horospherical construction of ads. the structure of this near-horizon geometry plays a cen-

tral role in the conjectured ads/cft correspondence, where the degrees of freedom in the

bulk theory are mapped to those of a conformal eld theory on the at boundary of ads

[9, 10, 11].

in [7], the hopf reduction on the u (1) bres of the s5 in this near-horizon geometry was
investigated. one obtains a solution of the nine-dimensional theory with an ads5  cp 2

geometry. redening elds according to the map that relates the type iib and type iia

variables in d = 9, one nds, upon lifting the solution back to d = 10, a solution of the
type iia theory with the geometry ads5  s1  cp 2.

in other words, the interchange

of kaluza-klein and winding modes under t-duality has resulted in an untwisting of
the u (1) bres in s5. one of the intriguing features of this process is that one arrives

at a solution of the type iia theory that ostensibly has no supersymmetry, and indeed,
no fermions at all. the reason for this is related to the fact that cp 2 does not admit

an ordinary spin structure. rather, it admits a generalised spin structure [12], meaning

that all fermions must necessarily carry certain specic non-zero values of electric charge

coupling to the u (1) gauge eld whose connection is responsible for the twisting of the

u (1) bundle.

in other words, all the fermions in the nine-dimensional theory must be

charged with respect to the kaluza-klein vector of the type iib reduced theory. after the

t-duality transformation, this becomes the winding vector, and so in consequence, from

the ten-dimensional type iia point of view the fermions would all have to carry non-zero

winding-mode charge. they would all be associated with non-trivial winding states, and

so would be seen only at the level of the full string theory, rather than in the low-energy

3

eective supergravity [7]. thus the ads5  s1  cp 2 solution of type iia supergravity is

actually a perfectly respectable bps solution of the full string theory, which happens to

look rather barren and unsatisfactory from the eld-theory standpoint.

as is well known, the anti-de sitter spacetimes adsn are closely analogous to the spheres
sn, with the only dierence that they are described by constant-radius surfaces in a at
embedding space irn+1 with metric signature (2, n  1) rather than (0, n + 1). by the same

token, therefore, the anti-de sitter spacetimes ads2n+1 of odd dimension can be described

n

, which are non-compact versions of the

usual complex projective spaces cp n. the bre coordinate is actually the time coordinate

in terms of u (1) brations over certain spaces gcp
of ads2n+1, so the non-compact gcp

n

is still a space of euclidean metric signature.1

it

should be emphasised that this time coordinate on the bre is periodic, and so the bundle

is u (1) even in this construction of the non-compact ads spacetime.

using this observation, we can now follow a similar strategy to the one used in [7], but
now we can untwist the bres of the ads5 in the ads5  s5 solution of the type iib theory.
 s5 solution of the euclidean-signatured nine-dimensional theory

obtained by time reduction of the type iib theory. it is important, in this regard, that the

this will give a gcp

time coordinate on the hopf bres is naturally periodic, as is appropriate for a kaluza-klein

reduction accompanied by a truncation to the massless sector. (see, for example, [13, 14]

for discussions of timelike reductions in supergravity.) as was shown in [14], the timelike

reductions of the type iia and type iib theories in d = 9 are not related by (real) eld

redenitions, and thus we cannot perform such a redenition in d = 9 to obtain a solution

of the usual type iia theory in d = 10. however, as was shown in [15, 16], one can instead

postulate the existence of a dierent theory in d = 10, called type iia in [15], which is
related by timelike t-duality to the type iib theory. the iia theory has a normal (1, 9)

metric signature, but its ramond-ramond elds have kinetic terms of the wrong sign.

similarly, a type iib theory was also postulated in [15], related by timelike t-duality to

the usual type iia theory.

tion of the nine-dimensional euclidean-signatured theory back to d = 10 after performing

the upshot of the above discussion is that if we lift the nine-dimensional gcp
the redenition to iia variables, we will obtain an s1  gcp

iia theory, but rather of the type iia theory postulated in [15]. the time coordinate

1it is clear that the bre must be timelike in this construction, since the metric of any complex space

n

must necessarily have an even number of timelike directions. thus the single timelike direction

of ads2n+1 resides in the bre, and not in the complex base-manifold.

such as fcp

of this ten-dimensional solution lies along the s1 direction. like the previously-discussed
ads5  s1  cp 2 solution of the usual type iia theory, it is a solution that ostensibly lacks

not only supersymmetry but also fermions, since gcp

structure. however, again this is an artefact of looking only at the eld-theoretic tip of

the string-theoretic iceberg, and in the full theory it should correspond to an honest bps

conguration.

in this paper, we explore some of the consequences of making hopf reductions on the

timelike bre coordinate of odd-dimensional ads spacetimes. we begin in section 2 by

setting up our notation and using it to describe the ten-dimensional type iia theory

of [15], and its relation to type iib. in section 3, we describe the geometry of the non-

spaces, including a very simple coordinatisation that is somewhat analogous

to the horospherical coordinatisation of ads itself. we also show how the odd-dimensional

n

compact gcp
ads2n+1 metrics are described as u (1) brations over gcp

n

. we then discuss the geometrical

structure of the hopf-bred description of ads2n+1, and its relation to the horospherical
parameterisation. in section 4 we discuss the supersymmetry of the ads5  s5 solution,
 s5 solution, making use of results for the killing
spinors in ads5 that are derived in an appendix. in section 5, we discuss the ads7  s4
 s4 solution of the

and its t-duality related s1  gcp
solution of eleven-dimensional supergravity, and relate it to a gcp

euclidean-signatured ten-dimensional supergravity coming from the timelike reduction of

2

3

d = 11. we discuss the supersymmetry of the ten-dimensional solution, using results for

the killing spinors of ads7 that are also obtained in the appendix.

2 type iib/iia t-duality

in this section we consider the case of timelike reductions and t-duality. the type iib

theory on a timelike circle of radius r should be t-dual to some string theory on a timelike

circle of radius 1/r, so that the limit r  0 should give a t-dual string theory in 9 + 1

non-compact dimensions. this t-duality cannot relate the iib theory reduced on a timelike

circle to the usual type iia theory reduced on the dual timelike circle, since as was shown in

[14], the usual iib and iia theories are not equivalent in d = 9, after timelike reductions.

instead, one is led to propose a new theory, called type iia, in d = 10, whose timelike

reduction is equivalent, after eld redenitions, to the timelike reduction of the usual type

iib theory [16]. we shall begin by setting up our notation and conventions.

let us begin with the type iib theory in d = 10. the bosonic equations of motion can

(2.1)

(2.2)

as described in [17], the self-duality of g(5) is to be imposed here after varying the la-

grangian (2.1) to obtain the equations of motion. this can be done consistently, since the

equation of motion for g(5) turns out to be dg(5) = db ns

(2) db rr

(2) , and the right-hand side is

identical to the expression for the bianchi identity for g(5), following from (2.2).

(2.4)

note that the kinetic terms for g(4), gns

(2), grr

(2) and f(2) all have signs that are reversed

compared with the case of a standard spatial reduction.

in a standard spatial reduction, the above nine-dimensional elds would be equivalent,

after appropriate redenitions, to those coming from the spatial reduction of the type iia

6

theory. in table 1 below, we indicate how the various potentials should be related. however,

to indicate the changes resulting from performing the reduction on the time, direction, we

underline those elds that arise with the non-standard sign for their kinetic terms. our

notation for the reduction of the gauge potentials a(3), a(2) and a(1) of the type iia theory
to d = 9 is that each a(n) reduces to give a(n) and a(n1)1.

the remarkable observation that allowed hull to hypothesise the existence of a new type

iia string theory is that after making the identications of elds in d = 9, as indicated in

table 1, it turns out that the elds of the type iia formulation in d = 9 can be reassembled

into elds in d = 10, where the elds a(3) and a(1) of the rr sector in d = 10 have the
non-standard sign for their kinetic terms.2 this theory, which is called the type iia theory,

therefore has the low-energy eective lagrangian

(2.5)

it should be emphasised that the type iia theory in d = 10 has a normal (1, 9) spacetime

signature.

2it was not a priori obvious that this should have been possible, since it requires that the signs of the

kinetic terms of the nine-dimensional elds after transforming to the type iia language must be exactly

correct in order to allow them to reassemble covariantly as ten-dimensional elds.

7

for completeness, we note that by the same token, one can also propose a type iib

theory, which again diers from the usual type iib theory only in having the non-standard

signs for the kinetic terms of its rr elds [15, 16]. it follows that the type iia and type
iib theories are themselves related by an ordinary spacelike t-duality.

our interest will be in starting from a solution of the usual type iib theory, with the
geometry ads5  s5, and performing a timelike reduction to d = 9. after redening elds

as in table 1, we can then lift the solution back to d = 10 to obtain a solution of the type

iia theory. in particular, our timelike reduction will be of a slightly unusual kind, in which

time is the bre coordinate on ads5 viewed as a hopf bundle over gcp

certain non-compact form of the complex projective 2-space. such a reduction is a timelike

, where gcp

2

is a

2

2

analogue of the spacelike hopf reductions that were considered in [7]. having arrived at a
 s1  s5 solution

 s5 solution in d = 9, we may lift it back to d = 10 to give a gcp

of the type iia theory.

gcp

2

let us begin with the ads5  s5 solution of the type iib theory. this solution involves

just the metric tensor and the self-dual 5-form eld strength g(5) of the type iib theory,

whose relevant equations of motion can be written simply as

rm n = 1

96 gm p qrs gn

p qrs ,

g(5) = g(5) .

(2.6)

in the absence of the other elds of the theory, we have simply g(5) = db(4). we may nd
a solution on ads5  s5 of the form

ds2

10 = ds2

ads5 + ds2

s5 ,

g(5) = 4mads5 + 4ms5 ,

(2.7)

where ads5 and s5 are the volume forms for the metrics ds2
respectively, m is a constant, and the metrics on ads5 and s5 satisfy

ads5 and ds2

s5 on ads5 and s5

r = 4m2 g ,

rmn = 4m2 gmn

(2.8)

respectively, where the indices run from 1 to 5. since the unit ads5 has metric d2
ricci tensor rmn = 4 gmn, it follows that we can write

ads5 with

ds2

ads5 = 1

m2 d2

we may now perform a timelike dimensional reduction of this solution to d = 9, along

we note that in the dimensional reduction of the 5-form of the type iib theory, its self-

duality translates into the statement that the elds g(5) and h(4) in d = 9 must satisfy

g(4) = g(5) = f(4).

we now perform the t-duality transformation to the elds of the d = 9 reduction of

the type iia theory. the relation between the iib and the iia elds is shown in table 1.
thus in the iia notation, we have the nine-dimensional conguration

the crucial point is that the 2-form eld strength f(2)1 of the iia variables is no longer a

kaluza-klein eld coming from the metric; rather, it comes from the dimensional reduction

of the 3-form eld strength in d = 10. indeed, if we lift the solution (2.13) back to d = 10,

we have the type iia conguration

to begin, we introduce (n + 1) complex coordinates z a on c n+1, where 0  a  n. we

also introduce the metric ab, dened by

the line element on c n+1 may be taken to be:

ds2 = ab dz a d z b ,

(3.1)

(3.2)

and is obviously invariant under su (n, 1). we then impose the su (n, 1)-invariant constraint

ab z a z b = 1 ,

(3.3)

which restricts the metric to the ads2n+1 manifold.

splitting the indices a = (, 0), with 1    n, we now introduce inhomogeneous

complex coordinates  , dened by

1    n .

(3.4)

the line element (3.2), subject to the constraint (3.3), can then be expressed in terms of
the coordinates   and z 0 as follows:

ds2 = |dz 0|2 + |z 0|2 d  d  + ||2 |dz 0|2 + z 0   d  d z 0 + z 0   d  dz 0 ,

immediately obtain the metric on ads2n+1, in the form

in fact, the parameterisation of the gcp

coincides precisely with a coset parameterisation in an upper-triangular gauge. to see

this, let us dene the (n + 1)  (n + 1) matrix ea

b, which has zeroes everywhere except

for a 1 at row a and column b. let h = e0

n, where 1  i  n  1, form the generators of the solvable lie algebra of su (n, 1).

(see, for example, [18, 19, 20, 21, 22] for discussions of solvable lie algebras.) in other

words, the generators e0

i and ei

n constitute the entire subset of positive-root generators

that have non-vanishing weights under the cartan generator h. (the generator h is the

non-compact cartan generator; all the others are compact in su (n, 1).) by exponentiating

11

the solvable lie algebra generators, we obtain a gauge-xed parameterisation of points in

the coset su (n, 1)/u (n). let us dene the coset representative

the coset metric can then be written as

ds2 = 1

(3.13)

(3.14)

where (dv v1) = dv v1 + (dv v1). an alternative way of writing the coset metric is
(3.15)

ds2 = 1

8 tr (m1 dm)2 ,

where m = v v. it is straightforward to verify that the metric (3.14) or (3.15) coincides

precisely with (3.11). note that the su (n, 1) symmetry of the metric can be seen from

the iwasawa decomposition, which implies that there exists a u (n) compensating transfor-

mation o such that v = o v  is again in the exponentiation of the solvable lie algebra,

where  is an arbitrary constant su (n, 1) matrix.

3.2 the boundary of ads2n+1

in the ads/cft correspondence, the conformal eld theory is dened on the boundary

of ads described in terms of horospherical coordinates [9, 10, 11]. to be precise, the

horospherical metric on adsd+1 can be written as

d2

adsd+1 = d2 +  e2 d d ,

(3.16)

where  is the minkowski metric in d dimensions. thus the boundary at xed  is at

d-dimensional minkowski spacetime. in the ads/cft correspondence, one considers the

boundary where  tends to innity.

in order to relate our description of ads2n+1 to this horospherical parameterisation, it is
useful rst to recall how the metric (3.16) on adsd+1 is embedded in at ir2,d. introducing
real coordinates x, y and w  in ir2,d, we have

x + y = e ,

x  y = e +   e ,

w  =  e ,

(3.17)

12

where x 2 + y 2 + w  w = 1. comparing with the complex coordinates (z 0, z i, z n)
given in (3.9), which satisfy the ir2,2n constraint (3.3) (with d = 2n), we see that we can

make the identications

z 0 = x + i w 0 ,

z n = y + i w 1 ,

z i = w 2i + i w 2i+1 ,

1  i  n  1 .

(3.18)

for general values of the ads2n+1 coordinates, this identication implies that there will
be rather complicated relations between the horospherical description using (, ), and the

hopf-bred description using (, , , xi, yi). these can be expressed as follows:

tan 1

1

2  = sec 1

e

2  = 0 + 1 ,
2  (cos 1
2  (cos 1
2  (0  1) + 1

2  2i + sin 1
2  2i+1  sin 1
2 xi yi  1

2  e ,
2  2i+1) ,
2  2i) ,
2 sin  (  + e2) .

xi = 2 cos 1

yi = 2 cos 1

 = cos2 1

(3.19)

in particular, we see that large positive values of  correspond to large positive values of

, although the  =constant surfaces do not coincide with  =constant surfaces unless  is

also xed. note that the time coordinate  of the hopf bred description is related to the
light-cone coordinate +  0 + 1 of the horospherical description.

let us now consider the boundary metric at xed  in detail. from (3.10), we see
4 e ds2, where the

that when  is large and is held xed, the ads2n+1 metric approaches 1
boundary metric ds2 is given by

ds2 = 2d (d  xi dyi) + dx2

i + dy2
i .

(3.20)

unlike the  =constant boundary in the horospherical description, this is not a at metric.

however, it is not hard to show that its weyl tensor vanishes, and hence it is conformally
at. indeed, if we dene the conformally-rescaled boundary metric ds2 = 2 ds2, then we
can show that ds2 will be at if  is taken to be

 =

1
2  + )

cos( 1

,

(3.21)

where  is any constant. this can in fact be understood from the relation between  and

 given in (3.19).

it is appropriate to make some further remarks about the relation between various

dierent descriptions of anti-de sitter spacetime. in particular, one might wonder how it

13

can be that the time coordinate  in the hopf-bred description (3.10) of the ads2n+1
metric is periodic, whilst the time coordinate 0 in the horospherical metric (3.16) is not.

of course this question is not a new one that occurs only because of our use of a hopf

bration to describe ads2n+1; the same issue arises if one uses standard coordinates of a

traditional kind in ads, as described, for example, in [23]. generalising to d dimensions,

we can write the standard metric on adsd as

d2

adsd =  cosh2 r dt2 + dr2 + sinh2 r d2

sd2 ,

(3.22)

where d2
(d + 1) dimensional spacetime ir2,d1 with coordinates (t, s, u a) as follows:

sd2 denote the metric on a unit (d  2)-sphere. this can be embedded in a at

t = cosh r cos t ,

s = cosh r sin t ,

u a = sinh r ua ,

(3.23)

where the (d  1) quanities ua satisfy ua ua = 1, so that the metric on the unit (d  2)-
sd2 = dua dua subject to this constraint. the coodinates of ir2,d1
sphere is given by d2
thus satisfy t 2  s2 + u a u a = 1. it is manifest from (3.23) that the adsd metric (3.22)
is given by d2
adsd = dt 2  ds2 + du a du a. again we see that the time coordinate t
in the ads metric is periodic. one can easily express the coordinates (t, r, ua) of the ads

metric (3.22) in terms of those of the horospherical metric (3.16) by making appropriate

identications of the corresponding embedding coordinates, for example by taking t = x
and s = w 0, with all the remaining coordinates u a, which are spacelike, equated with the

y and remaining w  ( > 0) coordinates of the horospherical embedding.

the global structure of the horospherical metric on ads was discussed in detail in

[24]. in particular, it was shown that the horospherical coordinates cover only one half of

ads. this is easily seen by noting from (3.17) that the positivity of e implies that only
the region x + y > 0 of the ads hyperboloid in r2,d1 is covered by the horospherical

parameterisation. from this observation, the dichotomy between the non-periodic time in

the horospherical parameterisation, and the periodic time of the standard or the hopf-

bred parameterisations, becomes understandable, since the latter two descriptions cover

the whole of ads. in fact the  =constant boundary of the horospherical description really

corresponds to the intersection of a 45-degree null hyperplane with the hyperboloid in
ir2,d1, and the time coordinate 0 parameterises an innite arc within the intersection.

finally in this section, it is worth commenting on the nature of the periodic times in

the standard parameterisation and the hopf-bred parameterisation of ads. in (3.22), it is

evident that /t is a killing vector, and hence in principle one could perform a timelike

14

reduction on this circle. however, the result would be rather inelegant, since the radius of

the circle depends on the radial coordinate r of the ads metric. by contrast, in the timelike

hopf reduction that we consider in this paper, the timelike killing vector / of the ads

metric (3.10) is of constant length, and so the reduction circle is of uniform radius over the

entire ads spacetime. this gives a much better-behaved interpretation to the kaluza-klein

reduction. it is analogous to the distinction between reduction on a circle of latitude, versus

a hopf circle, in a spacelike reduction on a killing direction in a sphere [6, 7, 8].

4 supersymmetry of the ads5  s5 solution

in section 2 we showed how the ads5  s5 solution of the type iib theory could be di-
2

mensionally reduced on the timelike hopf bres of ads5, viewed as u (1) bundle over gcp
in section 3, we showed how the fubini-study metric on gcp

convenient coordinate system, given by (3.11) with just a single pair of coordinates x and

could be constructed in a

2

.

y:

d2

4 = 1

4 d2 + 1

4 e (dx2 + dy2) + 1

4 e2 (d  x dy)2 .

the metric on the unit ads5 is then, from (3.10), given by

d2

ads5 =  1

4 (d + e(d  x dy))2 + 1

4 d2 + 1

4 e (dx2 + dy2) + 1

4 e2 (d  x dy)2 .

(4.1)

(4.2)

the relevant equation governing the supersymmetry of the ads5  s5 solution is the
killing spinor equation, which in terms of the unit ads5s5 spaces reduces to the conditions

d  = 1

2   ,

dm  = i

2 m  ,

(4.3)

in ads5 and s5 respectively. note that in writing these equations, we have made a specic

choice of orientation for the solution. with other choices, the right-hand sides of these

equations could be multiplied by factors of (1).

when we make the kaluza-klein reduction to d = 9, a truncation to the massless sector

involves taking all the elds to be independent of the reduction coordinate, which in our

case will be the time coordinate. consequently, this truncation will project out any elds,

including the killing spinors, that are time-dependent. the relevant killing spinors of ads5

are given in equations (a.17) in the appendix. we see that there are four of them, and that

they all have specic non-trivial dependence on the time coordinate  . thus they will all

be projected out in the kaluza-klein reduction and truncation process. note that the same

thing will happen if the opposite orientation choice for the solution is taken; the killing

15

spinors in ads5 that satisfy the equation d  =  1

2   are given in (a.18), and they too

all have non-trivial time dependence.

in fact not merely the killing spinors, but all spinors are projected out in the kaluza-

klein reduction and truncation procedure, in this hopf reduction on ads5. the reason for
manifold, like the usual compact cp 2, does not admit

2

this is that the non-compact gcp

an ordinary spin structure.

it does allow generalised spinors, but these must all carry

electric charge and be minimally coupled to the kaluza-klein vector potential a(1) [12].

such states, with the necessary electric charges, are in fact precisely non-zero modes in the

kaluza-klein spectrum. thus the full kaluza-klein spectrum of fermionic states in d = 9

will be associated with non-zero modes of the massive sectors of the theory.

the t-duality between the type iib and type iia theories can be seen among the
massless modes, at the level of the eld theories. namely, the massless elds from the s1

reduction of type iib supergravity map over into massless elds of type iia supergravity,

as we discussed in section 2. the t-duality will also be visible in the full string spectra,

where in d = 9 we include massive modes arising both from the kaluza-klein towers of

states, and also from the massive string excitations. the massive kaluza-klein states and

string states interchange under t-duality. since, as we have described, the fermions in the

d = 9 type iib eld theory picture are all contained in the massive kaluza-klein sector, it

follows that after t-dualising to the type iia picture, they will be associated with massive
string states. these will not be seen at the level of the eld theory in the type iia picture,

and so from a eld-theoretic standpoint the fermions, and in particular the supersymmetry,

will appear to be lost in the hopf dualisation procedure. it will, eventually, be regained

in the full string picture.

the upshot of this is that after dualising to the type iia theory in d = 9, we have a
 s5 that appears to lack not only supersymmetry, but also any

2

solution of the form gcp
the form gcp

2

fermions at all. likewise, after lifting back to d = 10 we will have a type iia solution of
 s1  s5 without supersymmetry or fermions. nonetheless this solution,

from the bosonic point of view, satises all the conditions for being a bps state, since it is
merely a t-duality transformation of a known bps solution, namely the ads5  s5 solution

of type iib.

16

5 hopf reduction of ads7  s4

in [25] it was shown that the ads4  s7 solution of d = 11 supergravity could be re-
interpreted as an ads4  cp 3 solution of the type iia theory in d = 10, by performing a
dimensional reduction on the hopf bres of s7. in [6], this solution was discussed from the

viewpoint of m-theory and the type iia string.

here, we may carry out a somewhat analogous hopf reduction of the ads7  s4 solution

of the d = 11 supergravity, where now we perform the dimensional reduction on the timelike

hopf bres of ads7 viewed as a u (1) bundle over gcp

the ads7  s4 solution is obtained by taking

3

.

ds2

11 = ds2(ads7) + ds2(s4) ,

f(4) = 6m (4) ,

(5.1)

where m is a constant and (4) is the volume form on the s4 metric ds2(s4). substituting

into the eleven-dimensional equations of motion, we nd that the ricci tensors for the ads7
and s4 metrics are given by

r = 6m2 g ,

rmn = 12m2 gmn .

(5.2)

thus in terms of standard unit metrics d2

ads7

and d2

s4 on ads7 and s4, we therefore

have

ds2

11 =

1
m2 d2

ads7 +

1
4m2 d2

s4 .

from the discussion in section 3, we can therefore write this as

ds2

m2 d2

1
4m2 d2

(5.3)

(5.4)

where d2

6 is the metric on gcp

3

, given in (3.11).

comparing with the standard timelike kaluza-klein reduction ansatz from d = 11 to

d = 10, for which

11 = e 1
f(4) = f(4) + f(3)  (dt + a(1)) ,

6  (dt + a(1))2 + e

(5.5)

we see that the ads7  s4 solution can be interpreted as a solution of the euclidean-

signatured d = 10 supergravity with elds given by

f(3) = 0 ,

here, 4 is the volume form of the unit 4-sphere. the time coordinate t of the eleven-

dimensional metric is related to the coordinate  on the hopf bres by t =  /(2m).

the ads7s4 solution of d = 11 supergravity has maximal (i.e. n = 4) supersymmetry

from the viewpoint of seven-dimensional gauged supergravity. however, the kaluza-klein

hopf reduction to d = 10 involves discarding all the modes that have dependence on the

time coordinate t. from the results for the killing spinors on ads7 given in the appendix,

we see that of the eight killing spinors on ads7 they either all depend upon  , or else just

2 out the 8 depend upon  , depending on the sign choice in the killing spinor equation.
 s4 solution

this means that in the kaluza-klein reduction, the ten-dimensional gcp

will have either no supersymmetry, or n = 3 supersymmetry, from the d = 7 viewpoint,

3

depending upon the orientation-choice associated with the hopf bration. this is analogous
to what was seen in the hopf reductions of ads4  s7, which gave either n = 0 or n = 6

four-dimensional supersymmetry, depending on the orientation [25, 6].

gcp

as we saw in section 3, the metric on ads2n+1 can be written as a u (1) bundle over

(a.5)

note that the potential term e (d  xi dyi) in the vielbein e , which is responsible for the
topological twist of the u (1) bres, is nothing but 2e0 , and 1
2 e0 is the potential for the

kahler form j on gcp

n

.

the killing spinor equation for this ads metric, which has unit radius, is

dm  =  1

2 m  ,

(a.6)

where  is the killing spinor, and dm is the covariant derivative on ads, dm  m +
1
ab ab. killing spinors exist for each choice of sign in (a.6), although in a specic
4 m
supergravity solution, having established orientation conventions, only one particular choice

will correspond to unbroken supersymmetries.

from the expressions in (a.1), (a.4) and (a.5) for the vielbeins and spin connection of

ads2n+1, we therefore nd that the killing spinor equation can be written as

  = 1

0  = 1

(a.11)

in order to make explicit computations of the killing spinors, we need to choose a

representation for the -matrices.

in terms of the standard pauli matrices i, we may

dene the  matrices in euclidean dimension d = 2n as

1 = 2  3  3      3  3 ,

2 = 1  3  3      3  3 ,

3 = 1l  2  3      3  3 ,

      ,

2n1 = 1l  1l  1l     1l  2 ,
2n = 1l  1l  1l     1l  1 .

in an odd dimension d = 2n + 1, with lorentzian signature, we use the above construction

for the dirac -matrices of 2n dimensions, and take 2n+1 (in the timelike direction) to be

2n+1 = i 3  3  3      3  3 .

(a.13)

the one-to-one correspondence between these indices and the ones we used for our param-

eterisation of ads2n+1 will be taken to be

2p1  p ,
2n1  0 ,

2p  p ,

1  p  n  1 ,

2n  0 ,

2n+1   .

(a.14)

in terms of these conventions, we nd the following results for the explicit forms of the

killing spinors in ads3, ads5 and ads7:
