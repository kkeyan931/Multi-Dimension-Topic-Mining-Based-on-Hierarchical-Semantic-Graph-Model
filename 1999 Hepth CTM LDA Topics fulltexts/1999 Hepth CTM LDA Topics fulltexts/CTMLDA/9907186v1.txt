abstract

we investigate eld theories on the worldvolume of a d3-brane transverse to partial
resolutions of a z3  z3 calabi-yau threefold quotient singularity. we deduce the
eld content and lagrangian of such theories and present a systematic method for
mapping the moment map levels characterizing the partial resolutions of the singularity
to the fayet-iliopoulos parameters of the d-brane worldvolume theory. as opposed to
the simpler cases studied before, we nd a complex web of partial resolutions and
associated eld-theoretic fayet-iliopoulos deformations. the analysis is performed
by toric methods, leading to a structure which can be eciently described in the
language of convex geometry. for the worldvolume theory, the analysis of the moduli
space has an elegant description in terms of quivers. as a by-product, we present a
systematic way of extracting the birational geometry of the classical moduli spaces,
thus generalizing previous work on resolution of singularities by d-branes.

introduction

in this paper we perform a systematic study of the worldvolume eld theory of one
d3-brane transverse to partial resolutions of a calabi-yau quotient singularity, by
generalizing and improving on the approach pioneered in [1]. particular examples of
such systems have been studied before in [1, 2], where it was shown that they exhibit
interesting phenomena such as topology change and projection of non-geometric phases.
the main purpose of the present paper is to improve on the previous analysis of such
systems, and to give a systematic and computationally ecient way to approach more
complicated singularities. as a simple illustration of our methods, we re-analyze the
case of c3/z2  z2 gorenstein singularities (a rst analysis of which was presented in
[2]), then we proceed to the analysis of the new and considerably more complicated
case of a d3-brane transverse to a c3/z3  z3 singularity.

the motivation of the present work is to prepare the ground for a detailed analysis
of the conformal eld theory on a large number of d3-branes transverse to partial
resolutions of a c3/z3  z3 gorenstein singularity [4]. such an analysis is motivated
by investigations of the ads/cft conjecture [3] for spaces of the form ads5  x5 with
x5 an einstein-sasaki ve-manifold describing the angular part of the tangent cone to
a partial resolution of such a singularity. as explained in [5, 6], the partial resolutions
of interest for the ads/cft conjecture are those1 for which the tangent cone at the
singular point can be written as a complex cone over a del pezzo surface, so that x5 is
a circle bundle over the del pezzo. since one knows how to obtain the associated eld
theory only in the case when the partial resolution is toric, one is currently restricted
to toric del pezzos, which amounts to considering only the surfaces f0 = p1  p1
and dp1, dp2, dp3 (the blow-ups of p 2 at one, two and three points respectively). of
these, only dp3 and f0 are known to admit a circle bundle x5 over themselves which
carries a regular einstein-sasaki structure, a result which follows from the work of tian
and yau on the positive case of the calabi conjecture [7, 8, 9]. their investigations
showed that all del pezzo surfaces dpk with k  3 admit a kahler-einstein metric of
positive curvature. this allows one to prove the existence of regular einstein-sasaki
ve-manifolds x5 which form the total space of a circle bundle over sp3.the case of
f0 follows from more elementary results.

from the work of [7], it is also known that dp1 and dp2 do not admit such met-
rics, which raises the dicult mathematical question of whether a (possibly singular)
associated ve-manifold, carrying a (possibly non-regular) einstein-sasaki structure
exists, and the physical question of what is the status of the ads/cft conjecture in
such a situation. it is known (see, for example [10, 6]) that the complex cone over each
toric del pezzo surface can be realized as the tangent cone to some partial resolution of
c3/z3  z3. however, it is in principle possible that such partial resolutions are sim-
ply inaccessible from the point of view of the worldvolume eld theory of a d3-brane
transverse to our space, namely that they cannot be realized physically by turning on

1we exclude the cases x5 = s 5 and x5 = s 5/z3, which can be studied by direct methods.

2

fayet-iliopoulos parameters in our theory. as discussed in [1, 2], the partial resolutions
of the singularity are realized as moduli spaces of the d-brane theory, in the presence
of certain fayet-iliopoulos terms. namely, the space of all possible fayet-iliopoulos
parameters admits a partition into cones, and the complex structure of the classical
moduli space of the worldvolume theory does not change as long as the fayet-iliopoulos
parameters remain inside of a given cone. however, there is no apriori reason to expect
that all partial resolutions can be obtained as moduli spaces in this manner. in other
words, it is in principle possible that some partial resolutions are never realized in the
eld theory in the way outlined above, no matter how one chooses the fayet-iliopoulos
terms. one purpose of the present paper is to test this possibility directly, by inves-
tigating the full list of eld theoretic realizations of the partial resolutions of interest.
as we will discover, these partial resolutions are in fact realized for some choices of
fayet-iliopoulos terms. this shows that the solution of the puzzle is necessarily more
subtle. the complexity of the analysis is quite pronounced, in marked contrast with
cases considered before. therefore, it turns out to be necessary to rene the techniques
available for studying the problem, and to follow a systematic approach towards its
resolution.

the structure of this paper is as follows. in section 1, we present an overview of
our results for the case of z3  z3, in nontechnical language. in section 2, we give a
systematic presentation of our method in a very general context. since this approach
leads to cumbersome notation, we illustrate the abstract methods by an application
to the example of a d3-brane transverse to a c3/z2  z2 quotient singularity and
its partial resolutions.
in section 3, we give a systematic presentation of the case
c3/z3  z3. section 4 presents our conclusions. the appendix lists certain data
relevant to the model c3/z3  z3. throughout the paper, we assume some familiarity
with toric geometry as well as with some basic concepts of algebraic and symplectic
geometry.

1 overview of the case c3/z3  z3

1.1 the geometric realization of the complex cones over
f0, dp1, dp2 and dp3
in [2] it was shown how a certain partial resolution of the c3/z2z2 singularity (which
leads to the conifold singularity) can be realized in the moduli space of d-branes. this
approach was used in [6] to deduce the worldvolume theory of n parallel d3 branes
transverse to a conifold singularity, as well as the corresponding worldvolume theories
at certain other conical singularities which can be obtained as partial resolutions of
c3/z2  z2. in this manner, a systematic procedure was presented for deducing the
cft side of the ads/cft correspondence in the case of nonspherical horizons. in
particular, the results of [11] (originally obtained by making use of arguments entirely
dependent on the high symmetry of the conifold), were reobtained in a systematic

3

manner and generalized. in this section, we will apply methods similar to [6] to the
conical singularities discussed in the introduction.

as it turns out, each of these singularities can be realized as a partial resolution of
c3/z3  z3. to explain this, consider a set of generators g1 = (1, 0), g2 = (0, 1) of the
group z3  z3. we choose the action of z3  z3 on c3 to be given by:

r(g1) : (x, y, z) 7 (x, 1y, z)

r(g2) : (x, y, z) 7 (x, y, 1z) ,

3 . as is the case with any abelian quotient singularity, this is an ane
where  = e
toric variety. thus, it can be described by a cone c in r3 which cuts the plane
x + y + z = 1 along a convex polygon. in our case, this polygon is a triangle with
vertices v1, v2, v3 which contains 7 other integral points {w1, . . . , w7}, only one of which
lies in its interior. we label these vectors as follows (see figure1(a)):

v1 = (0, 3)

v2 = (0, 0)

v3 = (3, 0) w1 = (0, 2) w2 = (0, 1)

w3 = (1, 0) w4 = (2, 0) w5 = (1, 2) w6 = (2, 1) w7 = (1, 1)

if all i = 0, then we obtain the unresolved c3/z3  z3 orbifold singularity.

2we consider only linear relations such that the sum of all charge vectors equals zero. equivalently, we

consider linear relations between the lifts of the vectors in figure 1(a) to the plane z = 1 in r3.

6

conversely, for generic values of i, the singularity is completely resolved and the
symplectic quotient leads to a smooth manifold. however, if the i lie in particular
cones of some codimension, the symplectic quotient is singular. the singularity is
determined by the cone, and is the same for all points in its interior.

as an extreme example, consider the one-dimensional cone in which all i = 0 except
for 5 > 0. in this cone, we see from (5) that there is a vicinity of the origin of the space
of homogeneous coordinates on which y7 cannot vanish (this coordinate corresponds to
the center of the triangle in gure 1(a)). we can thus perform explicitly one of the u (1)
quotients by xing its value to be real and positive. since its value is then determined
by the remaining homogeneous variables, we have eectively eliminated one coordinate
and one quotient from the problem. note that the higher the dimension of the cone in
which the i lie, the larger is the number of coordinates we can eliminate, and the milder
the singularity we obtain. the extreme case of the c3/z3  z3 singularity corresponds
to  = 0 (a zero-dimensional cone), while a complete resolution corresponds to a
generic vector , i.e. one which belongs to a seven-dimensional cone.

the procedure described above gives a symplectic description of the various reso-
lutions.3 it is not hard to see that, with appropriate choices of levels , one can realize
the singularity corresponding to any subpolygon of the triangle shown in figure 1(a).
for the geometrically-inclined reader, we mention that the discussion above is a
concrete realization of very general results of symplectic geometry and geometric
invariant theory. such results assure us that the space of moment map levels has a
canonical partition into conical chambers, which together form a fan  in r7(). as 
varies inside of a given chamber, the algebraic structure of our toric variety does not
change (even though the kahler metric induced by the symplectic reduction changes).
when  crosses a wall separating two chambers, the toric variety undergoes a birational
transformation known as a toric op; the variety is singular precisely when  lies on a
wall (this is the same mathematical structure which underlies topology change in the
moduli space of conformal eld theories [13]). the procedure we just described gives
one practical way of identifying these walls and chambers.

the complex cones over the del pezzo surfaces of interest are well-known to be
ane toric varieties themselves[10], and are described by the polygons listed in figure
1. the particular presentations shown there allow us to realize these cones as tangent
cones to partial resolutions of the c3/z3  z3 singularity. this amounts to viewing
the polygons as inscribed in the triangle of figure 1(a) and turning on appropriate
levels  in order to eliminate precisely the integral points which lie on the triangle

3to be rigorous, this procedure yields not the partial resolutions but their tangent cones. in fact, the
partial resolutions are only quasiprojective varieties, while the tangent cones are ane. as discussed for
example in [12], the partial resolutions are associated to triangulations of the rst set of points in figure
1, and therefore their fans are not of ane type, i.e. do not coincide with the fan of all faces of a single
3-dimensional cone. however, the procedure above suces to correctly identify the chambers in r7()
parameterizing the resolutions. note that the singularities we wish to realize (the complex cones over the
toric del pezzo surfaces) are ane toric varieties, and therefore they will only correspond to the tangent
cones to the partial resolutions we will identify below.

partial resolutions, as well as the corresponding charge matrices describing these as
toric varieties are listed in table 1.

being ane varieties, the complex cones over the del pezzo surfaces of interest
can be presented as the ane spectrum spec(r) of their coordinate ring r. this
ring admits a presentation r = c[z]/i with c[z] a polynomial ring and i an ideal
of relations.
in the context of toric geometry, the generators zi are the invariant
coordinates under the complex torus action in the holomorphic quotient description,
while i is the ideal of monomial relations constraining them. it is well-known [12, 14]
that the invariants z and monomial relations can be determined as follows. if c is the
cone over the polygon p describing our variety (where the polygon is embedded in the
ane plane x+ y + z = 1 of r3), then one considers the dual cone c v, which is the cone
over the dual (polar) polygon p v. while the cone c and the polygon p are appropriate
for the holomorphic quotient description of the toric variety, their duals c v, p v are
appropriate for the description in terms of invariants z and monomial relations i.
more precisely, there will be one invariant zi associated to each integral point of the
dual polygon p v. moreover, any integral linear relation between the primitive integral
vectors lying in the cone c v corresponds to a monomial relation among the variables

8

z. explicitly, a linear relation of the form pi ai ui between the vectors ui associated
to the invariant coordinates zi yields the monomial relation izai
i = 1. hence the
entire information characterizing the ring r is contained in the dual polygons, which
are listed in figure 2.

1.2 partial resolutions of the moduli space

the moduli space for one d-brane in the presence of fayet-iliopoulos terms can be
analyzed by the methods pioneered in [1]. in the case of c3/z3  z3, the main points
of the analysis are as follows. the classical moduli space in the presence of fayet-
iliopoulos terms is obtained by imposing the d- and f-atness constraints and further

9

dividing by the gauge group of the worldvolume theory, which in this case turns out to
be the torus u (1)8. if we denote the solution set of the f-atness constraints by z, then
the symplectic quotient which gives the moduli space (where the d-atness constraints
play the role of moment map equations) is isomorphic, as a complex variety, with the
holomorphic quotient of z by the complexication (c)8 of the gauge group. for one
d-brane on an abelian quotient singularity, the set z (which in the case c3/z3  z3
is complex eleven-dimensional, see section 3) has the structure of an algebraic variety
dened by a collection of monomial relations. therefore, z is an ane toric variety,
and by virtue of [15] it admits an alternate presentation as a holomorphic quotient:

z = c42/(c)31 .

(6)

the procedure for precisely identifying the quotient above (the mysterious numbers
42, 31 and the precise (c)31 action) is slightly technical and is explained in detail in
section 2. then the moduli space can be obtained in the form:

m = (z  s)/(c)8 = (c42  z)/(c)39 ,

(7)

where s, z are certain exceptional sets which have complex codimension at least
two in the respective spaces. note that z depends on the choice of fayet-iliopoulos
parameters , which explains the dependence of the complex geometry of the moduli
space on these parameters. in symplectic quotient language, the symplectic reduction
of z by u (1)8 is performed at a level characterized by the fayet-iliopoulos parameters
  r8. when re-writing z itself as a symplectic quotient (with zero moment map
level 0  r31) we are rewriting m as a double symplectic quotient. to arrive at a
presentation equivalent to the last entry in (7), we then rewrite this double quotient
as a single symplectic quotient, with certain overall moment map levels ()  r39.
the crucial point of this analysis is that the levels  are not arbitrary in r39, but are
determined by fayet-iliopoulos terms   r8. therefore, as  covers the whole of r8,
the parameters () will cover only a subspace of r39. as shown in sections 2 and 3,
the precise relation between  and  is given by an injective linear map:

r8() w r39() ,

(8)

such that () = w. therefore, () will only vary inside of an 8-dimensional sub-
space w of r39. this non-genericity of the level  is responsible for the fact that the
symplectic quotient description m = {x  c42|(x) = ()}/u (1)39 is not minimal,
in the sense that, depending on the sign of the various components of (), it will in
general be possible to eliminate many of the homogeneous variables of c42 essentially
by the same procedure as that discussed in subsection 1.1. in the holomorphic quo-
tient language, this is reected by the fact that the toric generators one obtains for
the description (c42  z)/(c)39 appear with multiplicities, so the toric description
is non-minimal as well. in order to obtain a minimal description, one must eliminate
all multiplicities in the list of toric generators or, equivalently, eliminate the redundant

10

homogeneous coordinates in the manner outlined above. in our case, this reduces the
full quotient to the form (c10  f)/(c)7, which is precisely what we would expect
from the geometric description of the partial resolutions. this reduced quotient has
a symplectic quotient description as well, and we let ()  r7 denote the associated
moment map levels.

as in the previous subsection, which homogeneous coordinates can be eliminated
depends on the sign of the various components of (). a systematic analysis shows
that this procedure denes a certain fan  in r39(). since w is an injective linear
function, it follows that there exists a similar division of r8() into cones i obtained
by taking the inverse image of the cones  through the map w (geometrically, this
amounts to intersecting the system of cones  of r39 with the subspace w ). which
homogeneous coordinates of the full quotient can be eliminated, and hence the minimal
description of m as a toric variety will thus depend on where  lies in r8 with respect
to the cones . note that not all of the cones i will be 8-dimensional. in fact, it is
not hard to see that those cones i which have dimension less than 8 will form faces
of the 8-dimensional ones.

as we discuss in sections 2 and 3, the reduction of the quotient (c42  z)/(c)39

to the quotient (c10  f)/(c)7 induces a piecewise-linear map

r39()  r7() ,

(9)

such that  = (). therefore, the dependence of  on  is given by the composite
map:

 :=   w : r8()  r7() ,

(10)

so that  = (). clearly  is a piecewise-linear map, which is linear on each of the
cones i . note that  need not have dierent linear expressions on each of the cones
i

4.
the discussion above shows that understanding how to realize the various partial
resolutions of c3/z3  z3 in terms of the worldvolume theory of the d3-brane amounts
to computing the map . indeed, this map connects the fayet -iliopoulos parameters 
of the d-brane worldvolume theory to the toric levels  discussed in section 2. there-
fore, given a choice of partial resolution (described in the language of section 2 by a
choice of ), the map  allows us to determine if and how this geometric choice is
physically realized in the d-brane theory.

clearly  must take the fan  into a renement of the natural fan  carried by
r7(), which was discussed in the previous subsection. hence the fan  is a renement
of the preimage of  through . the full information about the d-brane realization
of the various partial resolutions is encoded in this preimage. by using our methods,
one can in principle reconstruct the preimage from the smaller pieces provided by the
cones i.

4in technical terms, the fan associated to  as a piecewise-linear function is subordinate to the fan dened

by the cones i , i.e. this later fan is a renement of the fan of .

11

a systematic procedure for determining the map  is developed in the next section.
in the case of c3/z3  z3, the complexity of the computation turns out to be markedly
greater than in cases considered before [1, 2]. as we explain in section 2, the complexity
is characterized by an integer c5, which depends on the combinatorial data of the
problem, and for which we do not have an analytic expression. in a typical example
considered in [1], such as a z2  z2 quotient singularity, one had c = 9, while our case
case we have c = 42.

the result of the analysis is that each of the complex cones over f0, dp1, dp2 and
dp3 is indeed realized in the moduli space of the worldvolume theory. the details of
how this conclusion can be reached are discussed in the next sections.

2 the classical moduli space for one d-brane
transverse to an abelian calabi-yau quotient sin-
gularity

in this section, we spell out in detail our algorithm for the analysis of the moduli space
of one d-brane on an abelian quotient singularity.

the algorithm presented here is essentially a systematic version of the approach
taken in [1] and is carried out in the language of the quiver formalism [17] (see [18]
for a discussion in the context of d-brane moduli spaces), which turns out to be a
very eective way of implementing the projection conditions and analyzing the d-
and f- atness constraints. the main novel result is the construction of the map  in
subsection 2.8. as a simple illustration, we re-consider the realization of the conifold in
the moduli space of a d-brane transverse to a z2  z2 calabi-yau quotient singularity
[2].

2.1 the quotient group and its representation on c3

consider a nite abelian group . choosing a system of generators allows us to present
the group as:

 = zt1  ...  ztd

,

(11)

where the integers t1..td  2 are the torsion indices of . the elements of the group
are then written in the form:

with ua  zta (a = 1..d), while the group operation becomes:

u = (u1..ud) ,

u + v = ( (u1 + v1)mod t1, ..., (ud + vd)mod td ) .

(12)

(13)

5c is the number of facets of the cone of exponents associated to the f-atness constraints, as discussed

the irreducible representations of our group are given by its characters   hom(, u (1)),

which are in one to one correspondence with the elements of . indeed, every character
is of the form:

(14)

w(u) = a=1..de

2i
ta

wa (u  ),

where w = (w1...wd) is an element of  called the weight associated to . in fact, this
correspondence gives an isomorphism between  and the multiplicative group of its
characters:

w+w = ww
w = w .

(15)

we let  act on c3 by a special unitary representation . since this representation
decomposes into 3 irreducibles, we can always nd coordinates (x1, x2, x3) on c3 such
that  takes the form:

(x1, x2, x3)

(u)
 (u)(x) = (w1(u)x1, w2(u)x2, w3(u)x3) .

(16)

special unitarity requires that w1 + w2 + w3 = 0 (a relation which has to be understood
as holding in the group ).

example: the z2  z2 quotient singularity

the group  = z2  z2 has d = 2 torsion indices t1 = 2, t2 = 2. consider its action
on c3 given by the weights w1 = (1, 1), w2 = (1, 0), w3 = (0, 1) (which do satisfy
w1 + w2 + w3 = (0, 0) in our group) and associated characters:

1(u1, u2) = ei(u1+u2) = (1)(u1+u2)
2(u1, u2) = eiu1 = (1)u1
,

3(u1, u2) = eiu2 = (1)u2

with u = (u1, u2), u1, u2 = 0, 1. the generators (1, 0), (0, 1) of the group act as:

(x1, x2, x3)

(1,0)
 (x1, x2, x3)

(x1, x2, x3)

(0,1)
 (x1, x2, x3) .

2.2 solving the projection constraints

the low-energy theory on the worldvolume of a d-brane transverse to a quotient singu-
larity is given by a projection of a supersymmetric gauge theory with 16 supercharges[16].
the gauge group is determined by the singularity. the projection will be described in
more detail below. it results in an abelian gauge theory with a reduced supersymmetry
and, when appropriate, a superpotential. the classical moduli space of supersymmet-
ric vacua of this theory is found to be the tangent cone to the transverse space; this is

13

reasonable, since motion of the brane along this space is a supersymmetry-preserving
deformation, while the low-energy limit restricts us to small motions. the gauge theory
admits fayet-iliopoulos terms; these are expected to parameterize the deformations of
the singularity itself. how this works is the subject of this paper, and will be made
clear in what follows. we note here that this picture is a bit imprecise. as noted in
[16, 6] the abelian gauge symmetry is in fact broken by twisted closed-string modes.
as described in detail in [6], this fact may safely be ignored in our discussion below.

let || denote the number of elements of our group. the low-energy theory for
a d3-brane near this singularity is found as a projection of the theory of || branes
moving on the covering space. this is an n = 4 theory with u (||) gauge symmetry,
containing (in n = 1 language) a vector multiplet and three chiral multiplets in the
adjoint representation of the gauge group. as is by now familiar, the three chiral
multiplets represent a nonabelian version of the positions of the || branes in the
three complex dimensional transverse space. the quotient theory is obtained by a
projection, restricting attention to elds invariant under the action of , which we lift
to the chan-paton indices via its regular representation.

we label the entries of the adjoint elds by

x i = (x i

vv)v,v .

(19)

the spacetime indices of the matrices x i transform in the representation (16) and the
chiral elds surviving the projection are thus those modes which satisfy

r(u)x ir(u)1 = wi(u)x i

,

(20)

where r(u) is the regular representation of . since  is abelian, r decomposes into
the sum of all irreducible representations, each taken with multiplicity one. therefore,
we can always assume (after performing a unitary transformation x i  u x iu 1) that
r(u) are given by the diagonal matrices:

r(u)v,v = v(u)v ,v (v, v  ) .

then the projection conditions take the form:

vv+wi(u)x i

v,v = x i

v,v ,

(21)

(22)

which require that all elements of x i must be zero except for the following entries:

xi(v) := x i

vwi,v .

(23)

the set of surviving elds xi(v) can be elegantly described in the language of
graph theory[17]. for this, consider a set of points (nodes) which are in one to one
correspondence with the elements of . for each node v  , and for each i = 1..3,
draw an edge from v to v  wi. such an edge is associated with a surviving component
xi(v) of the matrix x i and will be called an edge of type i. if wi = 0, then the edge

14

connects the node v with itself, and is thus a loop, which cannot carry an orientation.
if wi 6= 0, the edge is given the orientation from v to v  wi (such oriented edges will be
called arrows). the graph q thus obtained is called the mckay quiver of the quotient
singularity c3/. we denote the set of its nodes by q0   and the set of its edges by
q1. since we have 3 types of edges leaving each vertex, the total number of edges in
the graph is equal to 3||. the mckay quiver can be thought of as the superposition
of 3 graphs qi (i = 1..3), where qi is obtained from q by keeping only the edges of
type i. the edges of qi represent the surviving components of the matrix x i. in the
absence of the projection conditions, qi would coincide with the full graph on the set of
nodes , i.e. it would contain an edge connecting any two elements of  (in particular,
it would contain a loop at each vertex). the projection conditions eliminate some of
these edges, in a manner controlled by the weight wi. the surviving components of x i
can be read from the quiver as follows. if a  q1 is an edge of q, then the associated
eld is given by:

x(a) := xtype(a)(tail(a)) = x type(a)

head(a),tail(a)

,

(24)

where tail(a), head(a)   are the tail, respectively head of the edge a (in case a is
a loop at a node v, we dene tail(a) = head(a) to be given by v; otherwise, a is an
arrow going from tail(a) to head(a)). throughout this paper, we will represent arrows
of type 1 by light grey lines, arrows of type 2 by dark grey lines and arrows of type
3 by black lines. in a color postscript rendering, these arrows appear respectively as
green, blue and red.

example:z2  z2 singularity

in this case, we have || = 4 so the quiver will have 4 nodes.
the edges v  v  wi are:
(1)type 1 (the surviving components of x 1):

(0, 0)  (1, 1),

(0, 1)  (1, 0),

(1, 0)  (0, 1),

(1, 1)  (0, 0) ;

(25)

(2)type 2 (the surviving components of x 2):

(0, 0)  (1, 0),

(0, 1)  (1, 1),

(1, 0)  (0, 0),

(1, 1)  (0, 1) ;

(26)

(3)type 3 (the surviving components of x 3):

(0, 0)  (0, 1),

(0, 1)  (0, 0),

(1, 0)  (1, 1),

(1, 1)  (1, 0) .

(27)

indexing the group elements as follows:

(0, 0)  1
(1, 0)  2
(0, 1)  3
(1, 1)  4

15

we can rewrite the edges as:

(1) type 1:

(2)type 2:

the arrows of various types are drawn with dierent shades of gray: light gray for type 1

(elds xuv), dark for type 2 (elds yuv), medium for type 3 (elds zuv). in color rendering,

these correspond to 3 dierent colors: green for type 1, blue for type 2, red for type 3.

2.3 the action of the surviving gauge group

the gauge elds in the theory do not carry transverse space indices, so the projection
conditions on these are:

r(u)u r1(u) = u .

(31)

16

if we index the entries of u by the elements of :

then (31) becomes:

u = (uv,v)v,v ,

vv(u)uv,v = uv,v ,

which shows that the surviving entries of u are given by:

uv = uv,v  u (1) .

(32)

(33)

(34)

therefore, the projected gauge group is given by diagonal unitary matrices and is
isomorphic with vu (1)  u (1). its action on the surviving elds xi(u) is:

xi(u)

u =(uv)vu (1)



uuwiu 1

u xi(u) = ei(uwi u)xi(u)

(35)

where we wrote uv = eiv with v  r. therefore, the charge of xi(u) with respect to
the v-th u (1) factor is:

(36)
note that the diagonal subgroup u (1)diag given by uv = ei with v =  independent
of v acts trivially on all surviving elds, so the eective gauge group is given by g =
u (1)/u (1)diag .

qi
v(u) = v,uwi  v,u .

the action (35) can be translated into quiver language as follows. if a  q1 is an

edge of the quiver, then the eld x(a) given by (24) transforms as:

x(a)  ei(head(a)tail(a))x(a) .

(37)

one can imagine the various u (1) factors of the surviving gauge group to be sitting at
the nodes of the quiver, having the natural action (37) on the variables x(a) associated
to its edges. note that each edge is charged with respect to the u (1) factors associated
to its terminal points (its tail and its head). the action of u (1) on x(a) is encoded
by the ||  3|| matrix of charges d = (dv,a)v,aq1 with entries:

dv,a = v,head(a)  v,tail(a)

.

(38)

(this is just another way of writing equation (36)). in graph-theoretic language, d is
the incidence matrix of the quiver, where the incidence index of an arrow a on a node
v is 1 if v = tail(a), +1 if v = head(a) and zero otherwise, while the incidence index
of a loop with any node (including the node where the loop sits) is dened to be zero.

2.4 the d-atness constraints
the moment map  : cq1  r for the action of u (1) on the space cq1 of all
surviving elds is given by:

v(x) = xi = 1..3

u  

v(u)|xi(u)|2
qi

17

(39)

which in quiver language becomes:

v(x) = xaq1

dv,a|x(a)|2 = xaq1,head(a)=v

|x(a)|2  xaq1,tail(a)=v

|x(a)|2 ,

(40)

or, in matrix form:

where p is the vector in rq1

+ with components:

 = d p ,

pa := |x(a)|2 .

(41)

(42)

the d-atness constraints in the presence of fayet-iliopoulos terms (v) (v  )

read:

note that the moment map satises the condition:

v(x) = v for all v   .

v(x) = 0 ,

xv

(43)

(44)

which is a consequence of the trivial action of u (1)diag. this is also reected in the
structure of the incidence matrix d, by the fact that the sum of all of its rows is zero.
consistency requires that the fayet-iliopoulos terms also satisfy:

v = 0 .

xv

therefore, we can always express 0 (where 0 is the identity element of ) as :

0 =  xv{0}

v .

(45)

(46)

it follows that the space of allowed fayet-iliopoulos parameters is in fact only (||  1)-
dimensional, and will be denoted by r||1(), where the vector  is given by  =
(v)v{0}. similarly, the rst equation of the system (43) (the one corresponding to
v = 0) is a consequence of the other ||  1 equations. eliminating it allows us to
rewrite the moment map conditions in the form:

p =  ,

(47)

where  is the (||  1)  3|| matrix obtained by deleting the rst row of d.

2.5 the f-atness constraints

the n = 4 theory includes a superpotential:

this can be expressed in terms of the surviving elds as 6:

w = ijkt r(x ix jx k) .

w = ijk xv

xk(v  wi  wj)xj(v  wi)xi(v) .

supersymmetric vacua of the n = 4 theory satisfy the f-atness conditions:

[x i, x j] = 0 (1  i < j  3).

taking (23) into account these reduce to:

(50)

(51)

(52)

xj(v  wi)xi(v)  xi(v  wj)xj(v) = 0 , for all 1  i < j  3 and v   ,

(53)

in agreement with the condition that (51) is stationary.

6note that the trace in (50) closes on the projected elds precisely due to the special unitarity condition

w1 + w2 + w3 = 0.

19

figure 4. pictorial description of the f-atness constraints.

the arrows on opposite sides have the same types.

the constraints (53) can be viewed as monomial relations:

xj(v  wi)xi(v)[xi(v  wj)]1[xj(v)]1 = 1

(54)

among the surviving elds. the solution of these equations denes a complex subvariety
z of the space cq1 of all variables {xi(v)}, which we call the variety of commuting
matrices. this algebraic variety can be described by the set of all its regular functions,
which are obtained by restricting the regular functions dened on cq1 (which are just
the polynomials in the variables {xi(v)}) to the subset z. the restriction of such a
polynomial is achieved by simplifying each of its monomials with respect to the relations
if x = (xi(v))i=1..3,v denotes the general point of cq1, then a monomial of
(54).
the polynomial ring c[x] has the form i,v[xi(v)]si(v), with si(v) some nonnegative
integer exponents. for simplicity of notation, we will write this as xs, where s =
(si(v))i=1..3,v is a vector in the lattice zq1 whose components are nonnegative. the
ane space cq1 can be described by the collection of all such exponents, i.e. by the
set of those points m of the lattice zq1 which belong to the cone c  rq1 dened by
the inequalities mi(v)  0 for all i, v (c is the rst octant in rq1).

on the other hand, the relations (54) are equivalent with:

xm = 1

for all m  r ,

(55)

where r is the sublattice of zq1 (which we will call the lattice of relations) spanned
by the vectors:

r(ij) := ej(v  wi) + ei(v)  ei(v  wj)  ej(v) ,

(56)

where (ei(v))i=1..3,v is the canonical basis of zq1. in general, the 3|| vectors (56)
are not linearly independent. in fact, it is not hard to see that they span a subspace
of dimension  = 2(||  1), so that the lattice of relations has rank .

picking such an integral basis {r1..r} of r, we can form a  by 3|| matrix r
whose rows are given by the components of r1..r. the conditions (54) show that two

20

of the ambient space cq1 will restrict to the same function on z
monomials xs, xs
if the (nonnegative) integral vectors s, s  zq1 are such that s  s belongs to the
sublattice r. therefore, one can describe z by considering the collection of those
points of the quotient lattice zq1/r which lie in the image  of the cone c via the
natural projection map p : zq1  zq1/r. the lattice zq1/r can be identied with
the orthogonal complement m of the lattice r in zq1. clearly m coincides with the
set of integral vectors which lie in the kernel of the matrix r. therefore, a basis of the
lattice m can be obtained by computing a basis of the integral kernel of r. if v1..v||+2
is such a basis, then one can form a 3|| by || + 2 matrix k whose columns are given
by the the components of v1..v||+2. then it is not hard to see that the projection map
p : zq1  zq1/r can be identied with the transpose k t of the matrix k, viewed as
a linear map from zq1 to m . therefore, once one has computed the matrix k, using
its columns as a basis of m identies m with z||+2 and the projection p(c) with the
cone  = k t(c) generated by the columns of k t, i.e. by the rows of k. in conclusion,
the toric variety z is described by the cone of exponents in z||+2 which is generated
by the rows of k.

example:z2  z2 singularity

in this case, the number of independent monomial relations is 2(||  1) = 6, so the
complex dimension of the variety of commuting matrixes is dimz = || + 2 = 6. the
matrix of an integral basis of the lattice of monomial relations is:

the lattice m is isomorphic with z6 and the 12 vectors given by the rows of k generate

2.6 the action of the projected gauge group on the vari-
ety of commuting matrices

let q := ||  1 denote the rank of the eective gauge group. a monomial xm of
the ambient space has a u (1)q charge given by the q-vector m. since the exponent
vectors are identied modulo the lattice r when imposing the f-atness constraints,
we can describe the restriction of the u (1)q action to the variety of commuting matrices
by the descent of the map  : zq1  zq to a map v : m  zq. the fact that d
does indeed factor through the projection p : zq1  m follows from the fact that the
relations (56) obviously lie in the kernel of . since we identify p with k t, it follows
that v can be obtained as the unique matrix satisfying the condition:

v k t =  .

note that v has dimensions q  (|| + 2).

2.7 the degenerate holomorphic quotient presentation of
the moduli space

once we have obtained the generators k of the cone of exponents for z and the
restriction v of the u (1)q action to z, a symplectic quotient presentation of the moduli
space can be obtained by the methods of [1]. we will simply summarize the steps of
that construction, referring the reader to [1] for details.

since z is dened by monomial relations inside of the ane space cq1, it will be
an ane toric variety (of complex dimension || + 2) whose toric generators are the
generators of the cone v dual to the cone of exponents . if c is the number of these
vectors7 and t is the (|| + 2)  c matrix having them as its columns, then one can
construct a (c  ||  2)  c matrix of charges q whose rows form an integral basis for
the kernel of t . note that we do not have an analytic expression for the number c of
toric generators, since this number depends in a complicated way on the combinatorial
properties of the cone .

at this stage, we have a toric variety z, presented as a holomorphic quotient
cc/(c)c||2, which is further divided by the (c)q = (c)||1 action given by the
charges encoded by the rows of v . this double quotient can be reduced to the form
cc/(c)c3 by choosing a lift of the (c)q action to the space cc. such a lift can
be given by rst choosing a left inverse u of the matrix t t (i.e u t t = id, with u a
(|| + 2)  c matrix) and then lifting the (c)q action to cc as the action specied
by the charge matrix v u . it follows that the moduli space can be described by the
holomorphic quotient cc/(c)c3 associated to the (c  3)  c charge matrix qtotal
obtained by stacking q and v u . in what follows, we will always place the matrix q
above the matrix v u when constructing the matrix qtotal.

example:z2  z2 singularity

7c coincides with the number of facets of . this is the integer mentioned in subsection 1.2, which

essentially controls the computational complexity of the problem.

2.8 the reduction of the holomorphic quotient

to simplify notation in the sequel, we let r = c  3 denote the number of rows of
qtotal. taking the transpose of the kernel of qtotal gives a 3  c matrix gtotal such
that qtotal(gtotal)t = 0r3 (note that the columns of gtotal, which play the role of
toric generators, are naturally associated with the columns of qtotal). the rows of
qtotal form a basis of integral linear relations among these generators. in general, the
holomorphic quotient description of the moduli space given by the charge matrix qtotal
is degenerate (not minimal) in the sense that the toric generators are not all distinct.

24

in order to make the following discussion clear, note that one can always reorder
the columns of gtotal such that identical generators appear consecutively (for example,
one can sort gtotal in decreasing lexicographic order on its columns, a convention which
we will follow everywhere in this paper). while performing this rearrangement, one
must also reorder the columns of qtotal accordingly, since each generator is associated
to such a column. hence we let gt be the matrix obtained from gtotal by sorting its
columns in decreasing lexicographic order, and qt be the matrix obtained from qtotal
by performing the same permutation on its columns.

the columns of gt will form a number b of blocks (1)...(b) (appearing in gt
in this order), such that each block (k) consists of mk copies of the same column
(k), and such that the 3-vectors (1)..(b) are all distinct. hence each block (k) is
a matrix of dimensions 3  mk. in general, some of these will consist of one column
only (then mk = 1), while other blocks will be multiple, i.e. will consist of mk  2
repetitions of (k). we let n be the number of non-multiple blocks and s the number
of multiple blocks, so that n + s = b. then the list of all toric generators consists
of m1 copies of (1), m2 copies of (2)... mb copies of (b). it is convenient to index
these as (k)
mk = (k) are the mk copies
of (k) appearing in the block (k). we also index the homogeneous coordinates of
the holomorphic quotient by z(k)

the rows of the matrix qt form a basis for the lattice s of integral linear relations
among the toric generators. in fact, this is the only piece of information needed to
reconstruct the holomorphic quotient, and any basis of the lattice s contains the same
data. in particular, one always has the freedom to perform invertible row operations

25

on qt. such a transformation (which corresponds to a change of integral basis of s)
has the form:

qt  w qt

,

(65)

with w an r  r integral matrix which is invertible over the integers 8. the pres-
ence of multiplicities in the list of toric generators implies that one can always nd a
transformation w which brings the matrix qt to a form which is particularly suited
for discussing the reduction procedure. this canonical form can be found as follows.
since each multiple generator (k) appears mk  2 times, we can always nd mk  1
elements of the lattice s which correspond to the following mk  1 obvious relations:

1 = (k)

2 = (k)
......

certainly not all relations among (k)
are of this form, but it is clear that all of the
remaining relations must come from whatever linear relations exist among the distinct
vectors (1)...(b) obtained by eliminating all multiplicities in our list. a basis for the
latter type of relations is given by the rows of the reduced charge matrix qreduced, which
is dened as follows. dene the matrix greduced to be obtained from gtotal by removing
all column multiplicities (that is, greduced consists of the distinct columns (1)..(b) in
this order (the inverse lexicographic order, in our conventions). then qreduced is any
matrix whose rows give an integral basis for the kernel of greduced. note that qreduced
has b = n + s columns and let p be the number of its rows. we clearly have p = b  3.
we conclude that one can always nd a basis of linear relations among (k)
i which
consists of all of the equality relations (66) together with the relations given by the
rows of qreduced.

remember that q = ||  1 denotes the number of u (1) factors of the projected
gauge group on the worldvolume (which coincides with the number of rows of the
matrix v ). the arguments above show that qt can always be brought to the form:

qcan =

(no zero columns are present in the case mk = 1), where the p-vector v(k) = 


is the k-th column of qreduced. note that the rows of qcan are naturally divided into
s+1 blocks, with the rst block consisting of the rst p rows and the next s blocks each
consisting of mk 1 rows for those mk which are dierent from 1. in particular, we have
(mk  1),

(mk  1) and c = pk=1..b mk. if we let let m = p k = 1..b

r = p +p k = 1..b

then we can write the row and column dimensions of qcan as r = p + m and c = b + m ,

the transformation (65) performed in order to bring qt to the form qcan brings

the moment map equations (63) to the form:

with the vector   rc given by:

qcanp =  ,

 = w0 ,

(70)

(71)

where w0 is the r  q matrix obtained by keeping only the last q columns of w .

since the rows of qcan are naturally divided into blocks, we divide the r = p + m -
(mk  1)-vectors (k) (for those k

vector  accordingly into a p-vector (0) and s
associated to multiple blocks, which we will call k1..ks) such that:

 =

(0)
(k1)
...
(ks)







.

27

(72)

then we can write:

(0) = w(0)
(k) = w(k)

for all k associated to multiple blocks,

(73)

where w(0) is the p  q matrix formed by the rst p rows of w0, and w(k) (for those k
corresponding to multiple blocks) are the (mk  1)  q matrices given by the rows of
w0 associated to the other row blocks of qcan.

in order to reduce the holomorphic quotient, we must eliminate mk1 homogeneous
variables out of the mk variables associated with each multiple block (mk  2). this
is possible provided that the levels  of the moment map are such that the mk  1
variables to be eliminated in each multiple block are assured to be nonzero. due to the
structure of qcan, the various canonical blocks are decoupled from each other, and
we can discuss reduction within each canonical block separately. indeed, the moment
map equations (70) have the form:

hold, then equation (77) assures that p(k)
l > 0 for all j 6= i,
so that we can eliminate all homogeneous variables associated to the canonical block
except for that associated to its i-th column. (if the maximum is attained precisely
at 0, then p(k)
j > 0 for all j 6= 1 and we can eliminate all variables except for that
associated to the rst column. this case corresponds to i = 1). the inequalities (78)
(taken for all values of i in turn) divide the space rmk1((k)) of values of (k) into mk
distinct chambers (k)
(i = 1..mk), which are maximal-dimensional polyhedral cones
in rmk1((k)).
, then we can eliminate all of
the homogeneous variables z(k)
. in order to perform this
reduction, we must rst eliminate the variables z(k)
( j 6= i) from the rst equations of
(74). this can be done as follows. since the the rows of c(mk) are linearly independent,
there exists a unique p  (mk  1) matrix fi(mk) such that:

if (k) belongs to the interior of (k)

except for the variable z(k)

fi(mk) =

where the rst i  1 columns are copies of the vector v(k) and the other columns are

hence performing this invertible row operation allows us to bring qcan to a form in
which all entries associated to the homogeneous variables z(k)
(j 6= i) are zero except
for those appearing in the canonical block c(mk). once qcan has been brought to this
form, and once we know that (k) lies in the interior of the cone (k)
6= 0
for all j 6= i), then we can eliminate these variables by using the (c)mk1 subgroup
associated with the rows of c(mk) in order to set each of them equal to 19. since these
variables have been eliminated from the rest of the charge matrix, this will not have
any eect on the remaining part of the holomorphic quotient. note, however, that
performing the row operations v (k)  v (k) + fi(mk)c(mk) (which is needed in order
eliminate our variables from the rst p rows of qcan) will induce a redenition of (0)
given by:

(so that z(k)

(82)

applying the above discussion to each of the s multiple blocks leads to the following
pattern of reduction. for each multiple block k (mk  2) we have a partition of the
space rmk1((k)) into mk chambers (k)
(i = 1..mk) which adjoin along common
faces. if, for each k with mk  2, (k) lies in the interior of one of these chambers (k)
,
ik
then we can reduce each of the multiple blocks k to its ik-th column. this is achieved
by performing the following invertible row operation on qcan:

which replaces the rst p components (0) of  with the p-vector given by:

 = i1...is = (0) + xk = 1..b

fik (mk)(k)

.

mk 6= 1

(84)

performing the reduction of z(k)
(j 6= ik) eliminates all except for the rst p rows of
q
can and all of its columns except for the non-multiple columns and those containing
the ik-th column of each multiple block. the result is a toric variety based on the

reduced matrices of generators and charges greduced and qreduced, in a phase given by
the moment map level i1..ik.

the crucial equations (84) can be described with the help of a piecewise-linear
function  : rr  rp which we dene as follows. for each set of s indices i1 =
1..mk1..is = 1..mks (remember that k1..ks  {1..b} index the multiple blocks), we let
i1..is be the cone (or wedge) in rr dened by:

i1..is = rp  (1)

i1  ...  (s)

is

.

(85)

the collection of these cones (which has  k = 1..b
mk  1

mk = k=1..bmk elements) divides

the space rr() into chambers which adjoin along common walls. if  belongs to the
chamber i1..is, then the value of  at  is given by the linear expression:

() = (0) + xk = 1..b

mk 6= 1

fik (mk)(k)

(86)

which appears in the right hand side of (84). it is obvious that these expressions agree
on the walls, so that  is a continuous piecewise linear function. in fact, one can give
an analytic expression for , if one notices that:

fik(mk)(k) = ( xj=1..ik1

(k)
j

)v(k)

,

(87)

where the sum is dened to be zero if ik = 1. since for   i1..is we have (k)  (k)
ik
and since by the denition of the cones (k)

this implies that:

i

,

xj=1..ik1

(k)
j = max(0, (k)

1 , (k)

1 + (k)

2 , ..., (k)

1 + ... + (k)

m(k)1) ,

it follows that for any   rr, the value of  at  is given by:

() = (0)  xk = 1..b

mk 6= 1

max(0, (k)

1 + (k)

(89)

the important information for us is the map  : rq  rp from the d-brane fayet-
iliopoulos parameters  to the eective moment map levels  in the reduced toric
presentation of the moduli space. this immediately follows from the above and from
(73):

() = w(0) xk = 1..b

31

(90)

in conclusion, the relation between the d-brane fayet-iliopoulos parameters and the
eective moment map levels is given by the piecewise-linear function .

since  is clearly continuous, its linear regions form a subdivision of rq() into
chambers which are polyhedral cones10. these chambers can be found from (78) as fol-
lows. for each k associated to a multiple block, consider the vectors e1(mk)...emk (mk)
in rmk1((k)) given by:

ej(mk) =

1
1
...
1
0
0
...
0









,

(91)

where the rst j  1 entries are equal to 1 (for j = 1, we dene e1(mk) to be the null
(mk  1)-vector). then the equations (78) (for a xed i  {1..mk}) can be rewritten
as follows:

hei(mk)  ej(mk), (k)i > 0 for all j = 1..mk , j 6= i .

using (k) = w(k) reduces these equations to:

hf (k)

i  f (k)

j

, i > 0 for all j = 1..mk , j 6= i ,

where the q-vectors f (k)

i

are given by:

f (k)
i = [w(k)]tei(mk) .

it is now clear that () will belong to i1..is if and only if  belongs to the cone
i1..is = (k1)
is the cone in rq() dened by the mk  1
inequalities (93). in general, the set of all cones i1..is will be a renement of the true
linear chamber structure of , since the action of the matrices [w(k)]t may collapse or
identify some of the cones (k)

2.9 determining the preimage of an eective wall

for the purposes of the present paper, an important question is the following. given a
convex subset h of the space of eective moment map levels rp(), what is its preimage
via the map  ? in particular, is this preimage nonzero ? that is, are the values of 
associated to h indeed realized by the d-brane theory ?.

10more precisely, these regions form an integral polyhedral fan in rq().

32

once the map  has been identied, this question can be answered as follows. for
simplicity of notation, consider only the case when h is determined by a set of linear
equations11:

ha(t), i = 0 (t = 1..g).

(95)

then () belongs to h if and only if ha(t), ()i = 0 for all t. in order to solve these
conditions, one can simply look for the solution in each of the cones i1..is, where 
is given by a linear expression. fixing such a cone, it is not hard to see that the set
1(h)  i1..is consists of all values of  which satisfy the inequalities (93) together
with the equalities:

where the components  = 1..q of the q-vector c(t)i1..is are given by:

hc(t)i1..is, i = 0 , (t = 1..g)

c(t)

i1..is = x=1..p

w(0)
a(t)  xk = 1..b

xj=1..ik1

w(k)

j hv(k), a(t)i .

mk 6= 1

(96)

(97)

for each i1..ik, this system gives a subcone of the cone i1..is (the cut of this cone
with the subspace (96)). running over all such cuts allows for a complete solution of
the problem, although the resulting presentation of the solution need not be the most
economical one.

the matrix gt has only 6 distinct columns, appearing with multiplicities:

m1 = 1 m2 = 2 m3 = 2

the conifold singularity can be realized in the region 2 = 0, 1 > 0, 3 > 0 of r3(),
which denes a two-dimensional cone in the space of eective moment map levels (this
particular realization corresponds to eliminating the points 1 and 4 in figure 5). the
preimage of this cone via the map  is the the union of the boundaries of the opposite

3 the case  = z3  z3

in this section, we apply the algorithm discussed above to the example of interest
in this paper  the worldvolume realization of partial resolutions of the c3/z3  z3
quotient singularity.

the group  = z3  z3 has d = 2 torsion indices t1 = 3, t2 = 3. we consider its
action on c3 given by the weights w1 = (1, 1), w2 = (2, 0), w3 = (0, 3) (which satisfy
w1 + w2 + w3 = (0, 0) in our group).

in this case, we have || = 9 so the quiver will have 9 nodes. the edges v  v  wi

can be obtained as above. indexing the group elements as follows:

(0, 0)  1
(0, 1)  4
(0, 2)  7

39

(1, 0)  2
(1, 1)  5
(1, 2)  8
(2, 0)  3
(2, 1)  6
(2, 2)  9 ,

we obtain the quiver drawn below:

with the above enumeration of the group elements, one obtains the 927 incidence
matrix d and the 8  27 matrix  given in the appendix (the rst row of d corresponds
to the neutral element of the group with our choice of enumeration).

the number of independent monomial relations is 2(||  1) = 16, so the complex
dimension of the variety of commuting matrixes is dimz = || + 2 = 11. the matrix

a choice for the matrices t, u, q, qtotal results in the manner explained above. the
types of these matrices are:

t : 11  42 u : 11  42 q : 31  42 qtotal : 39  42 .

(121)

in particular, in this example we have c = 42. these matrices, as well as the 3  39
matrix gt and the 39  42 matrix qt, are listed in the appendix.

41

the matrix gt has only 6 distinct columns, appearing with multiplicities:

m1 = 1 m2 = 3 m3 = 3 m4 = 3 m5 = 21
m6 = 3 m7 = 1 m8 = 3 m9 = 3 m10 = 1

.

(122)

thus gt has 7 multiple blocks and 3 non-multiple columns. keeping only one copy of
each distinct column (without changing the decreasing lexicographic order) gives the
matrix:

gred =

toric generators and matrix of charges:

which has p = 7 rows. the canonical form of qtotal, as well as the transition matrix
w (which has determinant 1) are listed in the appendix. the the 39  8 matrix w0
given by the last 8 columns of w can now be used to determine the piecewise-linear
function ,which we display in the appendix. our procedure above gives 15309 cones
 in r8(), which form a renement of the fan associated to . by intersecting them
with the preimages of the regions h of r7() listed in table 1, we nd:

(a)936 maximal-dimensional cones in 1(hf0) leading to the complex cone over

4 conclusions

we considered the status of the ads/cft conjecture for nontrivial horizons built as
u (1) bundles over toric del pezzo surfaces. by explicit computation, we discovered

44

that all such geometries (including those cases for which the existence of an einstein-
sasaki structure is problematic) can in fact be realized in the moduli space of d3-
branes transverse to a calabi-yau quotient singularity. by investigating the classical
moduli spaces of the associated worldvolume theories, we discovered a highly intricate
situation, whose complexity is markedly greater than in cases considered before. this
required the development of a systematic approach to the problem, thus improving on
the methods presented in [1].

in this paper, we conned ourselves to geometric aspects and to classical properties
of the moduli space of the associated eld theories. the quantum-mechanical aspects of
these theories and especially of their conformal limits are currently under investigation
[4].
