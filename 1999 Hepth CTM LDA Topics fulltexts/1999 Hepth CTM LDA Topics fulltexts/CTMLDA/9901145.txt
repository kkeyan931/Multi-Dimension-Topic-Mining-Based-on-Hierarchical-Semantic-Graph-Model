(2) lorentz invariance allows one decompose scattering amplitude scalar pseudoscalar parts: mab ijkl = ab ijkl(s) + 4 p aip bj p ab ijkl(s) , (3) ab only. ijkl(s) p ab ijkl(s) functions mandelstam variable = (pai + pbj )2 ijkl p ab analyticity postulates scalar pseudoscalar components scattering amplitudes, ab ijkl, boundary values analytic functions. means continued complex values s, resulting functions analytic. case, since theory integrable, exhibit two cuts along (ma + mb)2 (ma mb)2 real axis square root branching points, corresponding physical processes s- t-channel, respectively. then, physical s-channel amplitudes given limit onto cut upper-half complex s-plane, ab phys ijkl (s) = lim 0+ ab ijkl(s + i) , p ab phys ijkl (s) = lim 0+ p ab ijkl(s + i) , (4) generalization well known feynmans prescription perturbation theory. hermitian analyticity goes one step beyond. postulates physical s- s-matrix amplitudes opposite boundary values analytic functions, property proved perturbation theory , potential theory , using s-matrix theory alone  (see  references therein). since h~kak, ~kbl | 1 | ~pai, ~pbj = h~pai, ~pbj | 1 | ~kak, ~kbli , condition written hm ab phys klij (s)i = lim 0+ ab ijkl(s i) , 2 (5) (6) similar equation p ab ab g(z) = , hermitian analyticity results following relationships: ijkl(s) klij(s) analytic functions s, using f (z) analytic also ijkl. therefore, taking account ab ab ijkl(s) =  , p ab ijkl(s) =  . (7) immediate vital consequence hermitian analyticity unitarity equa- tions ss = 1 evaluate discontinuities ab ijkl(s) across two- particle cuts . ijkl(s) p ab two-dimensions, customary use rapidities instead momenta, (p0 ai, ~pai) = (ma cosh ai , sinh ai) . (8) then, (real) mandelstam variable function absolute value rapidity dierence colliding particles = |ai bj | > 0, = (pa + pb)2 = m2 + m2 b + 2 mb cosh , (9) two-particle amplitudes become functions . understood complex variables, change variables allows one open two cuts. hence, ab ijkl() p ab ijkl() meromorphic physical sheet mapped region 0 im , rst riemann sheet complex -plane. regarding analyticity, notice lim 0+ ab ijkl(s i) = ab ijkl() , > 0 . (10) therefore, since amplitudes meromorphic functions , hermitian analyticity relationships (7) translate ab ijkl() =  , p ab ijkl() =  . (11) finally, let us consider full s-matrix amplitude corresponding (1): h~kak, ~kbl | | ~pai, ~pbj = 4(2)2(ai ak)(bj bl) ab ijkl , (12) ab ijkl = ikjl + mab ijkl 4mamb sinh = ikjl + ab ijkl() 4mamb sinh + p ab ijkl() sign(ai bj )! , used 4 p aip bj = 4mamb sinh(ai bj ) = 4mamb sinh sign(ai bj ) , together standard relativistic normalization h~pbj | ~paii = ab ij (2) 2p0 ai (~pai ~pbj ) . 3 (13) (14) (15) using heaviside function (x) = 0 x < 0 = 1 x > 0, eq. (13) written ab ijkl = (ai bj ) sab kl ij () + (bj ai) sba nm ji () , sab kl ij () = ikjl + ab ijkl() 4mamb sinh + p ab ijkl()! , (16) (17) scattering amplitude process particle ai initially left-hand side particle bj, sba lk ji() = ikjl + ab ijkl() 4mamb sinh p ab ijkl()! , (18) amplitude process ai initially right-hand side bj. amplitudes seen matrix elements two maps  sab() : va vb vb va , sba() : vb va va vb , (19) rapidity dierence incoming particles. equivalently, sym- bolic algebraic notation commonly used describe two-dimensional factorised s-matrix theories , correspond ai() bj() = xk,l bj() ai() = xk,l sab kl ij ( ) bl() ak() , sba lk ji( ) ak() bl() . (20) two-particle amplitudes sab kl ij sba lk ji analytic functions . moreover, taking account (11), (17), (18), satisfy sab kl ij () = hsba ji lk()i (21) summarises hermitian analyticity two-dimensional factorised s-matrix theories central result. eq. (21) means two maps dened (19) related according sab() = ba(), dagger stands hermitian conjugation. direct consequence (21) scattering amplitudes real analytic functions unless exhibit additional symmetry properties. spell out, recall behaviour two-particle s-matrix amplitudes respect parity (p) time- reversal (t) transformations: p : sab kl ij () sba lk ji() , : sab kl ij () sba ji lk() . (22) shows real analyticity special case hermitian analyticity valid amplitude happens symmetric respect time-reversal trans- formations, conclusion could anticipated general grounds . another important consequence (21) concerns formulation unitarity con- dition. real > 0, unitarity s-matrix, ss = 1, translates sab xk,l kl ij ()hsab kl ij ()i 4 = ii jj . (23) however, using hermitian analyticity condition (21), unitarity equivalently written sab kl ij () sba j lk () = ii jj , (24) xk,l nothing else condition r-matrix unitarity (ru) arises naturally quantum group approach factorised s-matrices . actually, precise, ru analytic continuation (24) complex -plane. therefore, conclude dierence physical unitarity quantum group inspired r-matrix unitarity s-matrix amplitudes exhibit hermitian analyticity. order validate hermitian analyticity condition given eq.

(34) therefore, given set two-particle scattering amplitudes, sucient condition ensure basis hermitian analytic exists two matrices mb form given eq.

(35) worth noticing that, diagonal case, p transformations s- matrix amplitudes identical. explains examples involve non-parity invariant theories. rst example federbush model , studied great detail, among others, schroer, truong, weisz . federbush model describes two massive dirac elds ii whose interaction lagrangian lfm = 2 j j ii , (36) j j ii conserved vector currents dirac elds. two-particle s-matrix amplitudes federbush model particularly simple written  si,i() = sii,ii() = 1 , si,ii() = e 2i , sii,i() = e +2i . (37) since given rapidity independent phase factors, amplitudes si,ii sii,i clearly real analytic. however, straightforward check satisfy eq. (35) or, words, s-matrix federbush model hermitian analytic. second example provided integrable perturbation so(3)k wess- zumino-witten model discussed brazhnikov . 2 spectrum stable funda- mental (or basic) particles consists two particles associated two simple roots su(2), lie algebra so(3), whose mass taken dierent. two-particle scattering amplitude calculated tree-level  and, properly normalized, result s() = 1 + 2i k sinh( 0) + =  , (38) 0 non-vanishing real constant whose value depends coupling constants model. tree-level amplitudes real analytic but, contrary, satisfy hermitian analyticity condition eq.
