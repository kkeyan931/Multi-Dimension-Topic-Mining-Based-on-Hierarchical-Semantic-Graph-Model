abstract. we study the ultraviolet and the infrared behavior of 2d topological bf-theory

coupled to vector and scalar elds. this model is equivalent to 2d gravity coupled to topological

matter. using techniques of the algebraic renormalization program we show that this model is

anomaly free and ultraviolet as well as infrared nite at all orders of perturbation theory.

1 introduction

during the last decade the study of topological gauge theories provided deep insights

into the topology and geometry of low dimensional manifolds. the central feature of

topological eld theories is that the observables only depend on the global structure of

the space-time manifold on which the model is dened. there are in fact two dier-

ent types of topological eld theories: whether the whole gauge xed action or just the

gauge xing part can be written as a brs variation the model is of witten-type or of

schwarz-type, respectively. an example of witten-type models is the topological yang-

mills theory, representatives of schwarz-type models are chern-simons and bf theories.

a common feature of many such eld theories is the appearance of a so-called vector-like

supersymmetry in the at space-time limit.

it is due to the energy-momentum tensor

being brs-exact.

its generators when anticommuted with the brs operator close on

translations.

we are in particular interested in a bf-model dened on a two dimensional space-time

manifold. such a model was shown to be equivalent to a two dimensional gravity, which

has been discussed in connection with the liouville theory [2]. typically in two space-

time dimensions the propagators of massless scalar elds are ill-dened [4, 5]. due to the

singular behaviour of the ghost propagator at long distances, an infrared regulator mass

has to be introduced [3]. the infrared and ultraviolet niteness of the two dimensional

bf-model was already discussed in the realm of algebraic renormalization [3].

the present work is devoted to the investigation of an enlarged model with the inclu-

sion of a topological matter interaction [2] in the context of the algebraic renormalization

program [5]. the resulting model is characterized by an enlarged brs symmetry. more-

over, we show the existence of a vector-like supersymmetry, which fact simplies the

investigation of the infrared and ultraviolet renormalizability of this model.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we describe the model at the classical

level and we display its brs transformations as well as the vector-like supersymmetry

transformations. in section 3 we prove the niteness of the model. finally, in section 4,

we show that the model is anomaly free.

2 denition of the model at the classical level

let us rst consider the bf model on a two dimensional at manifold m endowed with an

euclidean metric . this eld model possesses the following metric independent action:

(1)

inv =

1

2 zm

d2x f a

 a ,

(1)

where  is the completely antisymmetric levicivita tensor (with 12 = +1), a is a
scalar eld, and the eld strength f a

 is given by

f a
 = aa

   aa

 + f abcab

ac
 .

(2)

aa

 stands for the gauge eld with gauge index a. f abc are the structure constants of
the gauge group which is assumed to be a compact and simple lie group with all elds

belonging to its adjoint representation. the generators of the lie algebra are chosen to
be anti-hermitian, such that [t a, t b] = f abct c and t r(t at b) = ab.
the action (1)

inv is invariant under the following innitesimal gauge transformations

()aa

 = (a + f abcab

c)  (d)a ,

()a = f abcbc ,

(3)

where a is a local parameter, and d is the covariant derivative. this model has already
been studied in much detail [3]. in the present work we enlarge the model by introducing
 and n scalars x a [2], where the index  takes all values
a set of n vector elds ba
from 1 to n. the contribution of these new elds represents a matter interaction. it is

given by the metric independent local functional

n = zm

d2x (db

 )ax a
 .

(4)

without loss of generality, we restrict ourselves to the case n = 1 implying that (4) now

reads

inv = zm
(2)

d2x (db)ax a .

(5)

the full action inv = (1)
given by the transformations

inv + (2)

inv is in fact invariant under an additional symmetry [2]

()a = f abcbx c ,

()ba

 = da ,

(6)

where a is an innitesimal parameter.

as usual, the quantisation procedure requires a gauge xing. in the present case we use

3

a landau-type gauge. due to the fact that we have two gauge symmetries we need two
sets of ghost elds with corresponding lagrange multiplier elds: (ca,a) are the faddeev-
popov ghost elds with corresponding antighost elds (ca,a), and (ba,da) are lagrange
multiplier elds enforcing the landau gauge conditions. the gauge xed action is then

given by inv + gf , where

d2x(caaa + aba) =

d2x[baaa + daba] +

gf = szm
= zm
+ zm

d2x[ca(dc)a  a(d)a + f abca(cbbc)] .

(7)

the next step is to promote the two gauge symmetries to the nilpotent and nonlinear

brs-symmetry of the gauge xed action

saa

sba

 = (dc)a ,
 = (d)a  f abccbbc
 ,
sa = f abc(cbc + bx c) ,

sx a = f abccbx c ,

sca =

f abccbcc ,

sa = f abccbc ,

sca = ba ,
sa = da ,

s2 = 0 .

sba = 0 ,

sda = 0 ,

note, that the brs-exact gauge xing term introduces a metric. as a consequence the

(9)

the transformations (9) dene the so-called vector-like supersymmetry 3 [8]. the invariant

action plus the gauge xing part is indeed invariant under (9),

additionally, the symmetries (8) and (9) give rise to the following on-shell algebra:

(inv + gf ) = 0 .

{s, s} = 0 ,

{s, } =  + equations of motion ,

{, } = 0 .

(10)

(11)

in order to write down the slavnov identity, which expresses the symmetry content of

the model with respect to brs, we couple the nonlinear brs transformations to brs-

invariant external sources leading to

ext = zm

d2x[a(saa

) + la(sca) + a(sa) + a(sba

) + a(sa) + y a(sx a)] ,

(12)

where (a, la, a, a, a, y a) are the external sources 4 whose canonical dimensions and

faddeev-popov charges can be read o (table 2).

typically the propagators of massless scalar elds are ill-dened in two space-time

dimensions [4, 5]. in particular, the analysis of the infrared problem connected with the

the same strategy can be used to regularize the propagator

which guarantees (14) and the brs invariance of the total action. however, to maintain also the vector

supersymmetry (allowing only linear breaking terms in the corresponding ward identity as well as keeping
) containing

the algebraic structure (11), see below) we need the additional expression rm d2x s(

it follows that the propagator (17) is regularized according to

habim = ab

.

the total action, which is just the vertex functional at the classical level, becomes

(0) = inv + gf + ext + ir,

with

ir = m +

as already mentioned, the introduction of external sources breaks the vector-like super-

now, for an arbitrary functional , depending on the same elds as the total action (0),
the corresponding linearized slavnov operator s, the ward operator for the vector-like
supersymmetry v, and the two antighost operators ga

(34)

(35)

where i represents collectively all the elds introduced so far. for the operator ha we
have to consider only the elds possessing a gauge index (represented by a) such that

ha = z d2xx  f abcb

the operator ka is given by

ka = z d2xf abc(cid:16)x b

(36)

(37)

now, it is easy to check that the classical action is invariant under the symmetries ex-
pressed by ha and ka, i.e.,

ha(0) = ka(0) = 0 .

(38)

if the functional (0) is a solution of the slavnov identity, s((0)) = 0, of the ward

identities (24) and (38), and of the two antighost equations (29), then, from the above

9

nonlinear algebra, we get the following linear algebra:

{s(0), s(0)} = 0,

{s(0), v} = p,

{v, v} = 0,

1o = ha,
2o = ka,
1o = 0,
2o = 0,

(39)

so far we have regularized the infrared divergent propagators and analyzed the symmetries

of the model as well as derived the constraints which the total action obeys.

in the

remaining part of the paper we will extend our analysis to the quantum level.

3 search for counterterms

we devote this section to the discussion of the stability problem which amounts to analyze

all possible invariant counterterms for the total action. in a rst step one has to modify

the classical action as

 = (0) + ,

(40)

where  stands for appropriate invariant counterterms. the total classical action (0) is

a solution of the slavnov identity (22), the vectorlike supersymmetry wi (24), the two

gauge conditions (27), the two ghost equations (28), and the two antighost equations (29)

as well as the two ward identities (38). the perturbation  is an integrated, local and

lorentz invariant polynomial of dimension 2 and vanishing ghost number.

by studying the stability of the theory we are looking for the most general deformation of
the classical action such that the functional  still obeys all the constraints listed above.

then the quantity  is subject to the following set of constraints


ba = 0,

da = 0,

a + 2

ca + ( +

ha = 0,

ka = 0.

(46)

(47)

(48)

(49)

(50)

(51)

the rst two equations (41) and (42) signify that  is independent of the two lagrange
multiplier elds ba and da. the equation (43) implies that  depends on the elds a,
ca and la only through the two combinations

a = a + ca   
la = la + 2ca .

4 ca,

(52)

correspondingly, we deduce from equation (44) that the elds a, a and a appear in
the expression of  only through the two combinations

a = a + a   
4
a = a + 2a.

a,

(53)

finally, the constraints (45), (46) and (47) may be combined in a single ward-operator ,

 = s(0) + v + p zm

d2x  


.

(54)

it is easy to check the nilpotency of the above dened operator . the vectors  and 

are constant vectors of ghost numbers +2 and +1, respectively. clearly, we get

 = 0,

(55)

which constitutes a cohomology problem. the nilpotency property of the operator 
implies immediately that any expression of the form   is a solution of (55), where  is a
local integrated polynomial of dimension 2 and ghost number 1. therefore, the general

solution of (55) is of the form

 = c +   ,

(56)

where c is the nontrivial solution whereas   is called the trivial solution.
the form of the trivial counterterm is restricted by dimension and ghost number require-

ments. since the elds (, x) both have dimension and ghost number zero, an arbitrary

11

combination of these elds may appear many times in the counterterm. we denote the

most general and possible combination of (, x) by f[, x], such that

f[, x] =



x{ni},{mi}=0



ni,mi  
yi=0

nix mi! ,

(57)

where {ni} and {mi} are understood as {n0, n1, . . .} and {m0, m1, . . .}, respectively. 
ni,mi
are, of course, constant coecients to be determined. actually, the most general trivial
counterterm   reads

  = zm

d2xtr(cid:18) f1 + y f2 + 2f3 +  f4af5 +  f6af7 + f8af9

+  f10a f11 + f12bf13 +  f14b f15 + f16bf17

4 f24  f25 +  

4 f28 f29 +  
+ lf32cf33 + f34cf35 + lf36f37 + f38f39(cid:19) .

4 f30f31

(58)

in fact the expression (58) may depend on the vector parameters  and  which are

not present in the total action (20). for this reason we have to arrange for the trivial
counterterm to be independent6 of these two constant vectors.
in other words, we re-
quire that  has to be invariant under the vectorlike supersymmetry and translation
ward operators. a lengthy and detailed analysis results in the expression for the trivial

counterterm given below:

s(0)ct = s(0) zm

d2xtr(cid:18) 1 ( a +   lc) + 2 (a + y   c) +

+ 3 ( b + x  l) + 4 (b + y x  )(cid:17) ,

(59)

where the i, i = 1, ..., 4 are arbitrary constants.

now we turn to the computation of the nontrivial counterterms c in (56). in a rst step
we introduce a ltering operator n such that

n = zm

d2x xf

f



f!,

(60)

where we have assigned to each eld homogeneity degree one. the quantity f in (60)
stands for all elds (including also  and ). the operator n leads to the decomposition

of the operator  as

6 our aim is to renormalize the theory dened by (20) which is independent of  and .

 = 0 + 1 .

(61)

12

the nilpotency of the operator  implies now that

2
0 = {0, 1} = 2

1 = 0.

(62)

the operator 0 does not increase the homogeneity degree, whereas 1 increases the ho-
mogeneity degree by one unit. now it is evident that from  = 0 we get

and d is the exterior derivative d = dx.
by looking to the expression (64) one easily recognizes that the elds 1, 2,

 transform as 0 doublets which means that they are out of the cohomology of 0 [7]. in
order to solve the cohomology problem (63) we write  as an integrated local polynomial:

(66)

such that f 0

recall that we are now working in the space generated by the elds which belong to

the cohomology of 0. these elds are denoted by . in other words, the operator 0
appearing in equation (70) is restricted to this space where the 0 doublets are absent.
one can easily show [8] that the solution of the descent equations (67) is given by

f 0

is then the nontrivial solution of the cohomology problem (63). a direct investi-
2) to a polynomial
gation shows that each monomial in (68) leads (after applying on it 0
depending on the ghost elds c and . but this is forbidden by the two constraints (48)

and (49) which are valid at each homogeneity degree. in other words the nontrivial so-

lution of the 0 cohomology in the space constrained by (48) and (49) is zero. from this
we deduce7 that the cohomology of the whole operator  is empty. so, the most general

solution of (55) takes the form

 = s(0)ct .

(72)

the restriction coming from the two antighost equations (48) and (49) eventually implies

the vanishing of all constant coecients in (59).

7 recall [7] [5] that the cohomology of the nilpotent operator , that is the space of all nontrivial

solutions of (55), is isomorphic to a subspace of the cohomology of 0.

thus we have shown that the constraint system (4149) forbids any deformations of the

classical action. furthermore, if the symmetries of the model are anomaly free, then

the symmetry content of the model at the classical level is also valid in the presence of

quantum corrections. the analysis of anomalies is the subject of the next section.

4 search for anomalies

in order to describe possible breaking of the symmetries which characterize the model,

one has to apply the quantum action principle (qap) [5]. the latter allows to describe

symmetry breaking in the following way:

 =  ,

(73)

where  is the full vertex functional given by a power series in h. the qap requires that
the breaking  is a local, integrated, lorentz-invariant polynomial of dimension 2 and
ghost number 1. the nilpotency of  leads again to a cohomology problem

which implies the solution,

  = 0 ,

 =   + a ,

(74)

(75)

where a 6=  a. the anomaly candidate a, as a solution of (74), has to obey8 the
constraints (41)  (44) as well as (48) and (49). in other words we have to solve the

cohomology problem (74) in the same space of functionals as the problem (55), hence, a
depends only on the elds: aa, ca, a, a, a, la, a, ba, y a, x a, a and a. in terms
of forms the functional a is a local integrated polynomial of form degree 2 and ghost

number 1

8 a non trivial statement is that the anomaly candidate has to fulll the antighost equations. due to

a = zm

f 1
2 .

(77)

the algebra (39) we deduce

{, ga
{, ga

1 } = ha,
2 } = ka.

(76)

furthermore, the quantum generating functional of vertex functions  = (0) + o(h) fullls the two
antighost equations and the two wis (38), see below. this fact together with (73) and (76) shows that

the anomaly candidate must obey the antighost equations.

where the quantities jqy, jqy, jqy and jqy are constant coecients.
by using the same arguments as before (see the last section) one can prove that all constant

coecients appearing in (79) must vanish. of course, this is due to the constraints (48)

and (49). let us, for instance consider the special case where

f 3
0 = t r(c)3 + t r()3 + t r(c2),

(80)

it leads to the anomaly candidate

a = t rzm(cid:18)3(c2 + a2c) + 3 ( y 2 + b2) + ({c, } +{c, a}b + a2 + y c2)(cid:19), (81)

where ,  and  are constant coecients.

however, it is easy to verify that this anomaly candidate (81) does not obey the two

antighost equations (48) and (49) unless  =  =  = 0. this means in particular that

the nontrivial solution of (74) is zero. then, the slavnov identity as well as the wi for

the vector-like supersymmetry transformations are anomaly free. hence, they are valid

at the full quantum level. concerning the two antighost equations, one can prove their

validity at the quantum level by simply following the arguments of [6]. furthermore, the

two gauge conditions, the two ghost equations and the two wis (38) are also valid at the

quantum level. this can be proven by simply using the strategy of [5].

as a conclusion, the model we analyzed in this paper is anomaly free and ultraviolet as

well as infrared nite at all orders of perturbation theory.
