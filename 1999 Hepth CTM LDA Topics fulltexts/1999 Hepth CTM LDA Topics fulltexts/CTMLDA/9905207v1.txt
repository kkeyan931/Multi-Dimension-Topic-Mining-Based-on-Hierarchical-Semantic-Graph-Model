abstract

exact relations between the qcd thermal pressure and the trace anomaly are derived. these are used,
rst, to prove the equivalence of the thermodynamic and the hydrodynamic pressure in equilibrium in
the presence of the trace anomaly, closing a gap in previous arguments. second, in the temporal axial
gauge a formula is derived which expresses the thermal pressure in terms of a dyson-resummed two-
point function. this overcomes the infrared problems encountered in the conventional perturbation-
theory approach.

1 introduction

conventional methods of calculating the qcd thermal pressure in perturbation theory have encoun-
tered an apparently insuperable infrared problem[1]. in previous papers, we have suggested a resum-
mation technique that may overcome this problem and tested it on scalar eld theory[2]. although
in principle this technique can be applied to qcd, in practice this would be far from simple, since it
involves introducing a mass for the gluon. although this mass must disappear at the end of the cal-
culation, its presence at intermediate stages is a considerable inconvenience. in this paper, therefore,
we introduce a more suitable technique for performing the resummation that is needed to overcome
the infrared problem.
it is common to distinguish two dierent denitions of pressure[3]. the rst, called the thermodynamic
pressure, is given in terms of the grand partition function

z = xi

hi| exp(h)|ii

(1.1)

the summation is over a complete set of physical states i. the hamiltonian h is an integral over an
element of the energy-momentum tensor:

h = z dn1x t 00(x)

the thermodynamic pressure is dened to be

p = t v 1 log z

(1.2)

(1.3)

the other denition of the pressure is in terms of the thermal average of another element of the
energy-momentum tensor. the hydrodynamic pressure is

p = ht 33i

(1.4)

although the two pressures p and p are generally expected to be equal for a system in thermal
equilibrium[3], it was remarked some time ago by landsman and van weert[4] that the presence of
the trace anomaly might cause certain complications.

in section 2 we derive formulae for the derivatives of the thermodynamic pressure p with respect to
the bare coupling g and to the temperature: see (2.7) and (2.8). in section 3 we replace g with the
renormalised coupling gr, and we use the renormalisation group to show that the two formulae for
the derivatives of the thermodynamic pressure p together imply that p is equal to the hydrodynamic
pressure p. we show also that the pressures departure from simple t 4 behaviour is calculable from
the qcd trace anomaly. in section 4 we show, by working in the temporal gauge, how simple dyson
resummation of the thermal gluon propagator removes the infrared problem. in section 5 we derive
some simple results for the small-coupling limit, which will be the starting point for a perturbation
expansion. we plan to consider such an expansion in a further paper.

2 unrenormalised formulae

consider pure-glue qcd for simplicity. at nite temperature there is a choice: one may heat up only
the physical components of the gauge eld[5], but for our purposes it will be more convenient to adopt
the more conventional formalism where also the unphysical components are heated. then one may
write[6] the grand partition function as a path integral:

z(g, t ) = z da dc dc db exphiz  i



dx0z dn1x l(g, x)i

the lagrangian is

l(g, x) =  1

4 f 2 + lgf + lghost

(2.1)

(2.2)

we have chosen to implement the gauge xing by means of an auxiliary eld b. the two common
choices of  are  = 0, with the x0 integration running along the imaginary axis, which is the imaginary-
time formalism, and  = , with the x0 integration following the keldysh contour, which is a version
of the real-time formalism[6]. either formalism may be used for most of our work, though when a
denite choice has to be made we will choose the second. so far, the elds are unrenormalised.

we scale each eld by some power of g, so obtaining new elds a, c, c, b. the integration measure
then acquires a power of g that depends, loosely speaking, on the number of space-time points, so it
is t -dependent. in order to cancel this, we consider the ratio

z(t, g)
z(t, 0)

(2.3)

and make the same eld transformation in the denominator as in the numerator, so that the extra
factor cancels. we then dierentiate the logarithm of (2.3) with respect to g, and transform back to
the original elds. choosing dierent powers of g in the denitions of the starred elds and using

2

the fact that the derivative of (2.3) must be independent of what powers we choose, we may obtain
various identities. for our purposes, the most useful change of eld variables is

a =a/g

c = c

c = c

b =bg

(2.4)

we use the denition (1.3) of the thermodynamic the pressure in terms of the grand partition function,
and the translation invariance property that

dz  i



dx0z dn1x f 2(x)e = iv hf 2(0)i

where v is the volume of the (n  1)-dimensional x-space. we nd that

satises

p (t, g) = p (t, g)  pfree(t )


g

p (t, g) =

1

2ghhf 2(0)i  hf 2(0)ifreei

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

notice the importance of the subtraction term: it avoids a divergence at g = 0.
we may directly obtain a dierent derivative of p (t, g). we use the original denition (1.1) of z,
together with the expression (1.2) for the hamiltonian h as an integral over the energy density t 00:



(cid:2) p (t, g)(cid:3) = hht 00(0)i  ht 00(0)ifreei

where again we have used translational invariance.

a gauge-invariant form for the gluonic part of the energy-momentum tensor is

t  = f f 

 + 1

4 g f 2

(2.8)

(2.9)

a trace over colour indices is understood. classically, t  is traceless, but in quantum theory there
is an anomaly that changes this. we use dimensional regularisation so that we work intially n = 4  
dimensions. then

renormalisation leaves behind a nontrivial limit as   0.

3 renormalisation

in (2.12), the coupling g is unrenormalised, and both d0 and d3 are divergent. we now replace g
with a renormalised coupling gr. for this, we use dimensional regularisation and the ms scheme, so
that we dene the gr by

g = /2z(gr)gr()

where z(gr) is a combination of wave-function and vertex renormalisation factors, and a beta function
by

(3.1a)

(3.1b)

(3.2a)

(3.2b)

(3.3a)

(3.3b)

(3.4)

(3.5a)

(3.5b)

the beta function has the structure[7]

(gr) = 

gr

 g

where for small gr

(gr) =  1

2 gr + (gr)

dierentiating (3.1a) with respect to  at xed unrenormalised coupling g, we obtain

0 = (gr)h

dierentiating it instead at xed , we then have

the pressure, being a physical quantity, is the same before and after renormalisation:

of course, pr depends also on . hence (2.7) is equivalent to

pr(t, gr) = p (t, g)

(gr)



gr

pr(t, gr) =  1

where we have used (2.10). so (2.12a) becomes

(gr)



gr

pr(t, gr) =  1

4 (d0  (3  )d3)

because the left-hand side of (3.5) must be nite when   0, the divergent part of (d0  3d3) as
a function of gr must be of order 1 exactly. because the derivative of the pressure in (2.12b) is a
physical quantity and so must be nite, the divergent parts of d0 and d3, which are temperature-
dependent, must be equal and opposite:

d0(t, gr) 

d(t, gr)



+ d0(t, gr) + o()

d3(t, gr)  

d(t, gr)



4

+ d3(t, gr) + o()

(3.6)

again, d0 and d3 depend also on . hence when   0

gr

pr(t, gr) =

d(t, gr) = lim0

or, equivalently,

pr(t, gr) = d(t, gr) = ht

(3.7a)

(3.7b)

we have used the fact that < t

we now use the renormalisation group to show that the thermodynamic pressure p is equal to the
hydrodynamic pressure p dened in (1.4). introduce the running coupling g(t ; gr) such that

g(; gr) = gr

(3.8a)

t


t

g(t ; gr)g

= (gr)



gr

g(t ; gr)t

it is familiar that, to calculate g(t ; gr), one makes use of the identity

because pr has dimension t n, we may write

(gr)



gr

g(t ; gr)t

= (g(t ; gr))

from renormalisation group theory,

pr(t, gr) = t n(gr, t /)

(gr, t /) = (g(t ; gr), 1)

thus

t


t

(gr, t /) = (g(t ; gr))



g(t ; gr)

(g(t ; gr), 1)

from (3.8b), we may replace (g(t ; gr))/g(t ; gr) with (gr)/gr. hence

t n+1 

t (cid:2)t n pr(t, gr)(cid:3) = (gr)



gr

pr(t, gr)

with this equation, together with (2.8) and (3.5a), we obtain

(3.8b)

where in the last step we have used the spherical symmetry. from (1.4), this is just the statement
that the thermodynamic pressure p is equal to the hydrodynamic pressure p. this result is valid in
spite of the presence of the trace anomaly, so this closes a gap in the conventional proof that explicitly
ignores it[4].

5

this result is valid in spite of the presence of the trace anomaly. however, the anomaly does inuence
the exact form of the pressure. in terms of the quantities introduced in (3.6), in the limit   0

the last term is just

p =  1

(3.14)

(3.15)

(3.16)

so when   0 the departure of the pressure from simple t 4 behaviour is just the result of the qcd
trace anomaly. (the other parts of the energy-momentum tensor, arising from the gauge xing and
the ghosts, do not contribute to this trace anomaly[8].)

4 temporal gauge

in the gauge a0 = 0 the expression for d0 in terms of the gluon eld is particularly simple:

d0 = hh(0ai)2i  h(0ai)2ifreei

(4.1)

there are some unanswered questions about the temporal gauge, both at zero temperature[9] and more
particularly in the nite-temperature imaginary-time formalism[10], though the real-time formalism
may well be free of problems[11]. in the temporal gauge, we can ignore faddeev-popov ghosts.

(4.5)

where some prescription is needed[9] to dene the meaning of 1/(q0)2. as long as a rotationally

(4.3), but with

t (q) =

l(q) =

i

(q0)2  l(q, )

(4.6)

we need not retain the appropriate prescriptions l in (4.5); they play no part because the self
energies t and l have zero imaginary parts only at q0 = 0, and when we use (4.6) in (4.2) the
contribution from this point is killed by the (q0)2 in the numerator of the integrand. when we insert
(4.2) into (3.7) we obtain

(4.7)

the factor of 8 is included because a trace over colour indices was understood in all the equations. as
in our previous work[2], any infrared divergence problem has been rendered harmless by the dyson
resummation: divergences of the self-energies are irrelevant because they now appear in denominators,
and any zero of the denominators at q = 0 is unimportant because of the powers of q present in d4q.

in making use of (4.7) in a semi- or non-perturbative way, which is the goal of subsequent work, we
have to renormalise accordingly. it is known [12] that removing a factor z 2 from the rst and third
terms of the integral (4.7) renders their contribution to the integrand nite. this factor may be found
by solving the dierential equation (3.3a), with the boundary condition that z(0) = 1. the solution
may be written in the form

log z(gr) + 1

2 log(cid:16) 2(gr)

gr (cid:17) = 2z gr

5 small-coupling limit

so far, our formulae are exact: we have not used perturbation theory to derive them. we now
investigate how they behave in the limit of small coupling. we content ourselves with simple results
that follow without detailed calculation, and leave a more extensive investigation to a future paper.
because[1][13] pr(t, gr) behaves as  1

rt 4 for small gr, we see from (3.2b) and (3.7b) that

6 g2

we may obtain almost the same information directly from (2.12a), which becomes with (3.6)

d = o(g4

r)


g

pr(t, g) =

1

2gh 4d



+ d0  3d3  d + o()i

(5.1)

(5.2)

to lowest order the unrenormalised and renormalised couplings are equal, so to this order the left-hand
side is again /gr pr(t, gr); therefore the singular term on the right-hand side must be at least of
order g3

r. furthermore, in order to give agreement with (3.7b),

d0  3d3 = 

2grd
(gr)

+ . . .

(5.3)

where the further terms are at least of order g3
r.

the pressure may also be calculated directly from (3.14). for this to be compatible with (5.2) in
lowest order, it must be that d0 = d3 to lowest order. that is

pr =  1

2 d0 + . . .

(5.4)

where the further terms are of order g3

r at least.

6 conclusion

(3.7) is an exact relation between the qcd thermal pressure and the thermal average of the trace
anomaly. we have used this to prove nonperturbatively the equivalence of the thermodynamic and
the hydrodynamic pressure.

with the plausible assumption that thermal eld theory may be formulated consistently in the tem-
poral gauge, (3.7) can be expressed in terms of a manifestly infrared nite integral (4.10) over the
full propagator. the absence of a chromomagnetic screening mass poses no particular problem to
an evaluation of (4.10), so it may provide a suitable starting point for developing new resummation
techniques.
