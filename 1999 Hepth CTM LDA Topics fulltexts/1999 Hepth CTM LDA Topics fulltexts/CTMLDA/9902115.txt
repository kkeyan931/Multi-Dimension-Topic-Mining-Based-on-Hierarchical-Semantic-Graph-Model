rather (manifestly gauge invariant) eld strength f . nevertheless, gauge transformation, chern-simons lagrangian changes total space-time derivative lcs = 2 ( a) . (4) therefore, neglect boundary terms (later shall encounter important examples true) corresponding chern-simons action, scs = r d3xlcs, gauge invariant. reected fact classical euler-lagrange equations 2 f = j ; equivalently : f = 1 j (5) clearly gauge invariant. note bianchi identity, f = 0, compatible current conservation : j = 0. 4 second important feature chern-simons lagrangian (3) rst-order space- time derivatives. makes canonical structure theories signicantly dierent maxwell theory. related property chern-simons lagrangian particular 2 + 1 dimensions , sense cannot write term 3 + 1 dimensions indices simply match up. actually, possible write chern-simons theory odd space-time dimension, 2 + 1 dimensions lagrangian quadratic gauge eld. example, chern-simons lagrangian ve-dimensional space-time l = aa . rst sight, pure chern-simons theory looks rather boring, possibly trivial, source-free classical equations motion (5) reduce f = 0, solutions pure gauges connections. contrast pure maxwell theory, even sourcefree theory interesting, physically important, solutions : plane-waves. nevertheless, chern-simons theory made interesting nontrivial number ways: (i) coupling dynamical matter elds (charged scalars fermions) (ii) coupling maxwell term (iii) taking space-time nontrivial topology (iv) nonabelian gauge elds (v) gravity discuss 2 + 1 dimensional gravity lectures far topic school, stress rich subject taught us great deal classical quantum gravity . 2 basics planar field theory 2.1 chern-simons coupled matter fields - anyons order understand signicance coupling matter current j = (, ~j ) chern-simons gauge eld, consider chern-simons equations (5) terms components : = b j = ijej (6) rst equations tells us charge density locally proportional magnetic eld thus eect chern-simons eld tie magnetic ux electric charge. wherever one, other, locally proportional, proportionality constant given chern-simons coupling parameter . illustrated figure 1 collection point charges. second equation (6) ensures charge-ux relation preserved time evolution time derivative rst equation together current conservation, = b = iji aj + ij = 0, implies j = ij aj + ijj 5 (7) (8) e _ e e_k e e_k e e_k e e _ e e _ e figure 1: collection point anyons charge e, magnetic ux lines strength e tied charges. charge ux tied together throughout motion particles result chern-simons equations (6). second equation (6), transverse piece identied a0. thus, chern-simons coupling level pure constraint regard matter elds dynamics, eect chern-simons coupling attach magnetic ux matter charge density way follows matter charge density wherever goes. clearly, applies either relativistic nonrelativistic dynamics matter elds. (a word caution - although chern-simons term lorentz invariant, regard simply convenient shorthand expressing constraint equations (6), much way always express continuity equation + ij = 0 relativistic-looking way j = 0. thus, problem mixing nonrelativistic dynamics matter elds relativistic-looking chern-simons term. actual dynamics always inherited matter elds.) tying ux charge provides explicit realization anyons .
