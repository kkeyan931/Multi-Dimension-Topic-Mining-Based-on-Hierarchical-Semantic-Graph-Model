attempts generalize correspondence asymptotically free theories also included. january 1999 based talk orbis scientiae 98, ft. lauderdale, florida, december 17-21, 1998. 1 introduction well-known string theory originated attempts understand strong interactions . however, emergence qcd theory hadrons, dominant theme string research shifted planck scale domain quantum grav- ity . although hadron physics one routinely hears ux tubes string tension, majority particle theorists gave hope string theory might lead exact description strong interactions. now, however, rst time say condence least strongly coupled gauge theories dual description terms strings. let emphasize one talking eective strings give approximate qualitative description, rather exact duality. weak coupling convenient description theory involves conven- tional perturbative methods; strong coupling, methods intractable, dual string description simplies gives exact information theory. best established examples duality conformal gauge theories so-called ads/cft correspondence  allowed many calculations strong coupling performed ease. notes describe, personal perspective, ideas led formulation ads/cft correspon- dence. also speculate future directions. sake brevity mainly discuss ads5/cft4 case directly related 4-dimensional gauge theories. long believed best hope string description non-abelian gauge theories lies hooft large n limit. quarter century ago hooft proposed generalize su(3) gauge group qcd su(n), take large n limit keeping g2 ymn xed . limit feynman graph carries topological factor n , euler characteristic graph. thus, sum graphs given topology perhaps thought sum world sheets hypothetical qcd string. since spheres (string tree diagrams) weighted n 2, tori (string one-loop diagrams) n 0, etc., nd closed string coupling constant order n 1. thus, advantage taking n large nd weakly coupled string theory. clear, however, describe string theory elementary terms (by 2-dimensional world sheet action, example). clearly important problem: free closed string spectrum large n spectrum glueballs. quarks included, also nd open strings describing mesons. thus, methods developed calculating spectra, found discrete, provides elegant explanation connement. furthermore, 1/n corrections correspond perturbative string corrections. many years eort, many good ideas, invested search 1 exact gauge eld/string duality . one class ideas, exploiting similarity large n loop equation string schroedinger equation, eventually led following fascinating speculation

conrms idea fth dimension, involves unexpected detour via black holes dirichlet branes. turn subjects next. 2 d-branes vs. black holes p-branes years ago became clear that, addition strings, superstring theory contains soliton-like membranes various internal dimensionalities called dirichlet branes (or d-branes) {$9611050$}. dirichlet p-brane (or dp-brane) p + 1 dimensional hyperplane 9 + 1 dimensional space-time strings allowed end, even theories strings closed bulk space-time. ways d-brane like topological defect: closed string touches it, open open turn open string whose ends free move along d-brane. end-points string p + 1 longitudinal coordinates satisfy conventional free (neumann) boundary conditions, 9 p coordinates transverse dp-brane xed (dirichlet) boundary conditions; hence origin term dirichlet brane. seminal paper {$9510017$} polchinski showed dp-brane bps saturated object preserves 1/2 bulk supersymmetries carries elementary unit charge respect p + 1 form gauge potential ramond-ramond sector type ii superstring. existence bps objects carrying charges required non-perturbative string dualities . striking feature d-brane formalism provides concrete (and simple) embedding objects perturbative string theory. another fascinating feature d-branes naturally realize gauge theories world volume. massless spectrum open strings living dp- brane maximally

(12) 3a similar conclusion applies strominger-vafa black hole {$9802150$}. 7 function f certainly constant: example, recent two-loop calculation {$9811224$} shows perturbative expansion f (g2 ymn) = 1 3 22 g2 ymn + . . . (13) thus, bekenstein-hawking entropy supergravity, (3), translated pre- diction f (g2 ymn ) = 3/4. fact, recent string theory calculation leading strong coupling correction gives {$9711002$} f (g2 ymn) = 3 4 + 45 32 (3)(2g2 ymn)3/2 + . . . .

physical phenomena. one approach, proposed witten {$9802109$}, builds observation thermal gauge theories described near-extremal p-brane solutions . also known high temperature limit supersymmetric
