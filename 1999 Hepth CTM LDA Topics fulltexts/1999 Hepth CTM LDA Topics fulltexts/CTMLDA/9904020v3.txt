abstract

energy bounds are derived for planar and compactied m2-branes in
a hyper-kahler background. these bounds are saturated, respectively, by
lump and q-kink solitons, which are shown to preserve half the worldvolume
supersymmetry. the q-kinks have a dual iib interpretation as strings that
migrate between vebranes.

1 introduction

supersymmetric sigma models in 2+1 dimensions with a kahler target space
generally admit static soliton-like lump solutions with energy e = |t|,
where t is the topological charge r  obtained by integrating the kahler
2-form  over the image in target space of the 2-dimensional space (see e.g.
[1]).
if the kahler target space admits a holomorphic killing vector eld
k then one can perform a scherk-schwarz (ss) dimensional reduction to
arrive at a massive supersymmetric sigma model in 1+1 dimensions with a
scalar potential v  k2. this theory admits q-kink solutions [2, 3] with an
energy

e = qq2

0 + q2 ,

where q0 is the noether charge associated with k, and q = r ik, the integral
being taken over the image in target space of the 1-dimensional space. be-
cause k is holomorphic the 1-form ik is closed, so q is a topological charge.
when q0 6= 0 the q-kink is a time-dependent solution of the sigma-model
eld equations. when q0 = 0 it becomes a standard static kink solution.
a 2+1 dimensional supersymmetric sigma model with a kahler target
space has an n=2 supersymmetry and the topological charge t appears as
a central charge in the supersymmetry algebra. this implies the bound
e  |t|, which is saturated by the sigma-model lumps. similarly, 1+1 di-
mensional massive supersymmetric sigma models obtained by ss dimensional
reduction actually have (2,2) supersymmetry, and both q0 and q appear
in the supersymmetry algebra as central charges. this implies the bound

e  qq2

0 + q2, which is saturated by the q-kinks.

if the kahler target space is actually hyper-kahler then the topological
charge t of the 2+1 dimensional model is just one of a triplet of topological
charges

(1)

(2)

where  is the triplet of kahler 2-forms. the number of supersymmetries is
also doubled to n=4, and the triplet of charges t appear as central charges
in the n=4 supersymmetry algebra. if the hyper-kahler space admits a tri-
holomorphic killing vector eld k then ss dimensional reduction along its
orbits yields a (4,4) supersymmetric massive sigma model in 1+1 dimensions,

t = z  ,

again with v  k2. the topological charge q is now one of a triplet of
topological charges

q = z ik ,

(3)

and the four charges (q0, q) appear as central charges in the (4,4) super-
symmetry algebra. this implies the bound

which is saturated by the (hyper-kahler) q-kinks.

e  qq2

0 + q  q ,

(4)

there is a close analogy here to n=2 and n=4 supersymmetric yang-
mills (sym) theories in 4+1 and 3+1 dimensions [2, 4]. the lumps of the
2+1 dimensional sigma model are similar to the instantonic solitons of the
4+1 sym theory; for example, they have no xed scale. the q-kinks of the
1+1 dimensional sigma model are similar to the dyons of 3+1 sym theory;
for example the sigma model has a vacuum angle and q-kinks generally have
fractional q0-charge, just as sym dyons generally carry fractional electric
charge for nonzero vacuum angle. the scale introduced by the potential term
in the 1+1 dimensional sigma model is analogous to the scale introduced by
the higgs mechanism in the sym case.

the n=2 and n=4 sym theories have interpretations in iib string the-
ory as eective eld theories describing the uctuations of d-branes around
some vacuum brane conguration. the dyon solutions are the eld theory
realization of (p,q) strings, or string webs, stretched between the d-branes.
a feature of the brane interpretation of the sym theories is that in a limit
in which the individual branes become widely separated the dyon solutions
must transmute into a solution of the equations governing the dynamics of a
single brane. this is an abelian sym theory, although not of a conventional
type because the brane action involves higher derivative interactions. these
dbi solitons, were found in [5, 6]; the supersymmetric solutions are world-
volume spikes of innite total energy per unit length equal to the tension of
a (p,q) string. solutions with nite total energy can be found by considering
the dbi action in an appropriate supergravity background [7].

these considerations motivate us to seek an interpretation of sigma-model
lumps and q-kinks as solitons on the worldvolume of the eleven-dimensional
supermembrane [8], otherwise known as the m2-brane. an m2-brane in a
vacuum background has supersymmetric, but innite energy, vortex solutions

3

that can be interpreted as intersections with other m2-branes [5, 6, 9]. in
a non-vacuum kahler background we may have the option of wrapping the
other m2-branes on nite area holomorphic 2-cycles of the background.
these are nite energy solitons that provide the brane realization of kahler
sigma-model lumps. we shall concentrate here on the hyper-kahler case;
specically, we shall consider the supermembrane in a background for which
the 4-form eld-strength vanishes and the 11-metric takes the form

ds2 = ds2(e(1,5)  s1) + ds2
4 ,
4 is the kaluza-klein (kk) monopole metric

where ds2

(5)

ds2

4 = v 1 (d  a)2 + v ds2(e3) .

(6)
the 1-form a on e3 satises v = a, which implies that v is harmonic
on e3. the vector eld / is killing and triholomorphic. we take it to be
the vector eld k of the previous discussion, i.e.

k = / .

(7)

the orbits of k are kaluza-klein (kk) circles which shrink to points at
singularities of v . let x be cartesian coordinates on e3 and x0 a constant
3-vector from the origin. the simplest choice of v that serves our purposes
is

v = 1 +

1

1

+

|x + x0|

|x  x0|

,

(8)

which describes a two-centre kk-monopole of m-theory.

upon reduction on orbits of k, the kk-monopole acquires an interpreta-
tion as two parallel iia d6-branes separated in e3 by the constant vector
2x0. the two centres of the metric at x = x0 can be considered as the
poles of a 2-sphere parametrized by  and the distance from one d6-brane
along the line joining the two of them. a membrane wrapped on this 2-sphere
has a iia interpretation as a string stretched between the two d6-branes [10].
now consider a d2-brane parallel to the two d6-branes. in general it will not
be colinear in e3 with the two d6-branes and so will not intersect the string
joining them. however, we may move it until it does intersect. from the
d=11 perspective we then have a pointlike intersection of two m2-branes,

4

one an innite planar one and the other one wrapped on a nite area 2-cycle
of the background. the singular intersection point may be desingularized
so that we have a single m2-brane with a non-singular lump soliton on it of
some nite size l. from the iia perspective this corresponds to separating
the points at which the strings from each of the two d6-branes meet the
d2-brane.

in the case of the lump, the vacuum is an innite planar m2-brane. to nd
a brane interpretation of the hyper-kahler q-kink we will need to wrap this
m2-brane on some one-cycle of the background space. this corresponds to
ss reduction on some killing vector eld with closed orbits. the dimensional
reduction will preserve all supersymmetries only if this killing vector eld
is triholomorphic. the killing vector eld k of (7) is therefore an obvious
candidate, but ss reduction on orbits of k does not yield a potential v 
k2 as one might have expected from our earlier summary of the results of
ss reduction in sigma models. rather, it yields a non-vanishing, and non-
uniform, iia string tension. the non-uniformity of the tension creates an
attractive force between the string and the d6-brane but on reaching the
d6-brane core the string can simply dissolve into born-infeld ux. to get
the potential term in the dimensionally reduced action one must suppose
that the 11-metric (5) has another tri-holomorphic killing vector eld with
closed orbits. we may take this to be a vector eld generating the u(1)
isometry of the s1 factor in this metric. let us call this vector eld .
dimensional reduction on orbits of k +  leads to a bound state of the iia
string discussed above with a d2-brane wrapped on orbits of . this bound
state is itself bound to the d6-brane. the eective string action is the desired
brane version of the massive hyper-kahler sigma model, admitting q-kink
solutions. t-dualizing in the (compact)  direction yields a (1,1) iib string
bound to a d5-brane. as we shall see, the q-kink solution can then be
interpreted as a (1,1) string that migrates from one d5-brane to another.

although lump and q-kink solutions are known to minimise the energy
of the relevant sigma model it does not immediately follow that they min-
imise the energy on the m2-brane because of the nonlinearities of the dirac
membrane action. by means of the brane version of the bogomolnyi argu-
ment [9], we show that the energy of the m2-brane is indeed minimised by
these solutions. we consider the lumps rst, as these are static, and then
generalize to the q-kinks. both congurations are then shown to preserve
some fraction of the worldvolume supersymmetry. again, this is known in the

5

sigma-model case, but the supersymmetry transformations of the supermem-
brane are dierent. they can be deduced from a combination of the target
space supersymmetry and the kappa-symmetry of the supermembrane, and
this leads to a simple condition for a worldvolume eld conguration to pre-
serve some fraction of supersymmetry [11, 12, 13]. for a vacuum background
this condition is easily interpreted as a constraint on the 32 independent con-
stant killing spinors of the background, but its interpretation is less direct in
a non-vacuum background in which the killing spinors are not constant and
span a space of lower dimension. here we present a more geometrical deriva-
tion of the conditions for preservation of supersymmetry and we discuss some
subtleties of the non-vacuum case that have been passed over previously.

2 energy bounds

our starting point for nding soliton solutions as minimum energy congu-
rations of the supermembrane will be its hamiltonian formulation [14]. let
i = (t, a) be the worldvolume coordinates, with a the worldspace coordi-
nates, and let x m be the d=11 spacetime coordinates. the supermembrane
lagrangian, omitting fermions, can then be written as

l = pm x m  sapmax m  1

2vhp 2 + det(gab)i ,

where

gab = ax mbx ngmn

(9)

(10)

is the induced worldspace metric, pm is the 11-momentum conjugate to x m,
and sa and v are lagrange multipliers. let x m = (y i, x i) (i = 0, 1, 2) so
that

ds2

11 = dy idy jij + dx idx j gij ,

(11)

where  is the 3-dimensional minkowski metric. we make the gauge choice
y i() = i. this implies that

gab = ab + ax ibx j gij .

(12)

it also implies that

6

pm = (cid:16)  1,piax i, pi(cid:17)

(13)

where  is the energy density relative to the brane vacuum (which is taken to
have unit tension). the hamiltonian constraint imposed by v can be solved
for 

( + 1)2 = 1 + x i  x j gij + (gij + x i  x j )pipj

+ 1
2(x i  x j )(x k  x l)gikgj l ,

(14)

where we have used standard 2d vector calculus notation for worldspace
derivatives. this expression diers in several respects from the corresponding
expression for the sigma-model energy density. firstly, the supermembrane
expression is quadratic in ; this is because the sigma-model approximation is
a kind of non-relativistic approximation to the supermembrane (they dier in
the same way that the energies of a relativistic and non-relativistic particles
dier). secondly, the supermembrane expression involves terms quartic in
derivatives that are absent in the sigma-model case.

2.1 lumps

we now aim to rewrite the above expression for the energy density in the
form

the moment we leave unspecied the six 2-forms (r). these conditions are
already sucient to ensure that all but the quartic terms in x of (14) are
reproduced. to reproduce the quartic terms too we require that

for every vanishing skew eigenvalue of x ij the dimension of the trans-
in this reduced space, we must
verse space is eectively reduced by two.
again have (18) but it may now be possible to choose some of the six j
matrices to vanish. for example, if x ij has two vanishing skew-eigenvalues
then the transverse space is eectively 4-dimensional; in other words, there
are four active scalars. we may now set all but two of the j matrices to zero.
the other two, together with i can be taken to be the three almost complex
structures of the transverse 4-manifold (these will be covariantly constant if
this transverse 4-space is hyper-kahler, but we need not assume any spe-
cial properties at this point). if x ij has three vanishing skew-eigenvalues,
corresponding to two active scalars, then the transverse space is eectively
two-dimensional, and we may take all the j matrices to vanish.

given (16) we deduce that

(22)

the condition (21) is the statement that in complex coordinates z ,
adapted to the complex structure i, the functions z (z) are holomorphic on
worldspace, with z = 1 + i2. the conditions (22) are implied by (21) if the
matrices j (r) are such that

ij (r) + j (r)i = 0 ,

r = 1,   , 6 .

(23)
this is true when i, j (r) are the 7 complex structures of e8. it is also satised
if i, j (1), j (2) are the three almost complex structures of a 4-dimensional
space, with the other j matrices vanishing. this is the case of most interest
here because we may obviously reduce the transverse 8-space to an eective
transverse 4-space by requiring all scalars to vanish except those associated
with the ds2
4 metric in (5). this restriction still allows congurations with
either two or four active scalars.

in the case of a at background, a solution of (21) with 2n real active
scalars has the interpretation as the (orthogonal) intersection with the world-
volume of n m2-branes, corresponding to a spacetime intersection of n + 1
m2-branes. the spacetime conguration is known to preserve the fraction
1/2n+1 of the spacetime supersymmetry [15] so we may expect the fraction
of worldvolume supersymmetry preserved to be 1/2n. this can be conrmed
directly from a consideration of -symmetry of the supermembrane [16, 17].
the lump solution of (21) for the kk-monopole background is also one with
two active scalars and preserves half the worldvolume supersymmetry but
the total number of worldvolume supersymmetries is half what it would be
in a at spacetime. the fraction of supersymmetry of the m-theory vacuum
that is preserved by the total system is therefore 1/8 (1/2 for the solution, 1/2
for the brane and 1/2 for the background). we shall examine the question
of supersymmetry in more detail in section 3.

2.2 q-kinks

we now set

2x i = ki ,

(24)

where k is a holomorphic killing vector eld. the holomorphicity condition
ensures that the dimensionally reduced 1+1 dimensional theory preserves
the n = 2 supersymmetry of the (2+1)-dimensional model. any additional

9

supersymmetries will be associated with additional complex structures; if k is
holomorphic with respect to them too then the reduction will preserve these
additional supersymmetries. for the kk-monopole background we may take
k to be the triholomorphic killing vector of (7). using (24) in (14) we have

( + 1)2 = 1 +(cid:16)gij + x ix j + kikj(cid:17) pipj + |x|2 + |k|2

+ 2x [ikj]x [kkl]gikgj l ,

(25)

where x = 1x. restricting to static (p = 0) and uniform (x = 0)
congurations yields  = q1 + |k|2  1  1
2|k|2, which is the membrane
version of the scalar potential that leads to q-kink solutions interpolating
between its minima at xed points of k where |k| vanishes.
density can be rewritten as

under the same conditions as before, the expression (25) for the energy

x i + 1  v2 kj ij

( + 1)2 = h1 + vk  p + 1  v2 x i kj iji2

for arbitrary constant v with |v| < 1. we deduce that

with equality when

p i = vki ,
x i =

i ,

.

(26)

(27)

since these equations imply the vanishing of the remaining terms.

setting p i = x i in (27) we recover the equations found in [2], the solu-
tions of which are q-kinks. the explicit q-kink solution of [2] was given for
the two-centre metric with v as in (8) but without the constant term (i.e.
for the eguchi-hanson metric [18]). the explicit solution when v includes a
constant term has been found by opfermann [19].

3 supersymmetry

the supermembrane is invariant under all isometries of the background.
supersymmetries correspond to grassmann odd killing vector superelds
 = aea, where ea = ea
m m . the (grassman even) spinor component
 is a killing spinor in the standard sense, at least in a purely bosonic back-
ground. the (grassman odd) vector component a is a supereld satisfying
the constraint da = (a). let {} be the complete set of these killing
vector superelds and let {} be a corresponding set of anticommuting pa-
rameters. the supersymmetry transformations of the worldvolume elds z m
are then

(32)

this restricts only dz m , but this is sucient. note that this gauge choice
is invariant under supersymmetry, at least in a bosonic background and for
vanishing worldvolume fermions; under these conditions we may neglect the

(35)

more generally, we must take into account the fact that  is neither constant
nor a spinor with 32 independent components. for the simplest backgrounds,
including the kk-monopole background considered here, we have

   = f  ,

(36)

where f is an ordinary function, and  is a constant 32-component spinor
satisfying

p  = 0 ,

(37)

with p a constant projection matrix. for the kk-monopole background the
matrix p is just the product of four constant dirac matrices, one for each of
the four dimensions of the 4-metric, and it has the property (associated with
the fact that this background preserves 1/2 of the spacetime supersymmetry)
that trp = 16. the fraction of spacetime supersymmetry preserved by the
brane plus background conguration is therefore determined by the number
of simultaneous solutions to (35) and (37). note that the function f of (36)
is irrelevant to the nal result.

we now x worldvolume dieomorphisms by the static gauge choice

with this gauge choice the condition (35) becomes

(40)

(41)

(42)

the condition (39) for preservation of supersymmetry can now be ex-
panded in a power series in x. we assume here that each term in the series
must vanish separately1. at zeroth order in this expansion we learn that

 =  .

(43)

because the projector p involves only the i matrices, this equation tells
us that the worldvolume vacuum preserves half the supersymmetries of the
supergravity background, i.e. that the m2brane is 1/2 supersymmetric.

at rst order in the x expansion we learn that

kkx ii  = 0 .

(44)

this implies various higher-order identities.
det gij vanishes and that

in particular it implies that

imjngjmgin = 1

2(ij gij)2 .

(45)

using these identities, and the constraints on  quadratic and cubic in x
that also follow from (44), one can show that the full constraint  =  is
satised. thus, (44) is the only condition (apart from p = 0) that we need
analyse to determine the fraction of supersymmetry preserved by lump and
q-kink soliton solutions.

having found the conditions for partial preservation of worldvolume su-
persymmetry, we are now in a position to verify that the lump and q-kink

1for a at space background this amounts to the assumption that the worldspace is
the contact set of a kahler calibration. kahler calibrations are only ones of relevance here,
although for the m5-brane there are other calibrations for which the assumption would be
false. see [16, 17, 20] for a discussion of calibrations in relation to branes.

solitons are supersymmetric and to determine the fraction of supersymmetry
they preserve. we need not discuss the lump and q-kink cases separately
because the formalism to follow will apply equally to both. for lumps we just
set v = 0 while for q-kinks we set 2x i = ki. we begin with the observation
that the equations

x i = v2x i ,

(53)

each term in the sum must vanish separately. this leads to a set of equations,
each of which can be written in the form

(e + e)(1  i[, ]) = 0 .

(54)

it follows that either e = 0, which eectively requires one complex worldvol-
ume scalar to be constant, or  must satisfy the constraint

(1  i[, ]) = 0 ,

(55)

which reduces the fraction of supersymmetry preserved by two, unless it is
already satised by virtue of the p projection imposed by the background.
we briey discussed the at background case in section 2.1. solutions
with 2n active (real) scalars preserve 1/2n of the worldvolume supersym-
metry and hence 1/2n+1 of the spacetime supersymmetry; their spacetime
interpretation is as n + 1 intersecting m2-branes. the computation of the
fraction of worldvolume supersymmetry preserved by the nite energy lumps
and q-kinks is slightly more involved because the eects of the p projection
must be taken into account. however this just reduces the initial number of
supersymmetries by a factor of two. the m2-brane breaks half of that and
the lump and q-kink solitons halve it again, exactly as in the at space case.
these results could be anticipated from the central charge structure of
the supermembrane worldvolume superalgebra. in the kk-monopole back-
ground we would need to consider the n=4 d=3 worldvolume supersymmetry
algebra. for simplicity we concentrate here on the n=8 d=3 algebra relevant
to a supermembrane in a at space background. as we are considering only
scalar central charges, the supersymmetry algebra is [21]

{q i

, q j

} =  i jp +  z i j ,

(56)

where the 8 supersymmetry charges q i transform as a chiral so(8) spinor.
the antisymmetric central charge matrix z has four skew eigenvalues k
(k = 1, 2, 3, 4). the positivity of the {q, q} anticommutator implies the
bound
(57)

the fraction of worldvolume supersymmetry preserved is 2n5 where n is the
number of factors of det{q, q} of the form (m 2  )2 that simultaneously

15

vanish. for example, states for which all four skew eigenvalues are equal,
but non-zero, preserve half of the worldvolume supersymmetry. note that
since i is a spinor index the central charge z cannot be directly interpreted
as the two-form topological charge z associated with a membrane in a given
2-plane; the relation between the two is such that equal skew-eigenvalues of
z corresponds to three vanishing skew-eigenvalues of z, and vice-versa.

4 iib interpretation of q-kinks

in the introduction we explained briey the iia superstring interpretation of
the supermembrane lump solutions. as mentioned there, the most natural
superstring interpretation of q-kinks is in terms of iib superstring theory.
we now return to this point.

it was implicit in our discussion of the q-kink in section 2.2 that 2 =  is
periodically identied; otherwise we do not have a genuine compactication.
since we had already made the static gauge choice y 2 = , it follows that we
must take y 2 to be an angular variable, i.e. the coordinate of the s1 factor
in (5). in fact, the killing vector eld /y 2 can be identied as a multiple
of the triholomorphic killing vector eld  mentioned in the introduction.
a standard dimensional reduction on orbits of the triholomorphic killing
vector eld k would imply that y 2 is the only eld depending on . however,
the ss reduction ansatz of (24) means that y 2 is not the only -dependent
worldvolume eld. in fact, given (7), the condition (24) implies that  = 1,
or  =  up to a constant. if we introduce the new coordinates

x 0 =   y 2

y =

(58)

2 (cid:16)y 2 + (cid:17)

then the combination of the static gauge choice and the ss reduction imply
that (x 0, x) are -independent while y = . in other words, we are wrapping
the membrane on the y direction, i.e. on the k +  cycle. we can consider
this to be a non-marginal bound state of a membrane wrapped on the k cycle
with one wrapped on the  cycle [22]. the iia interpretation of this bound
state (with the k cycle interpreted as the kk circle) was explained briey in
the introduction: a membrane wrapped on the k cycle yields a iia string in
the d6-brane while a membrane wrapped on the  cycle yields a d2-brane,
so we end up with a iia string bound to a d2-brane in a d6-brane. we now
consider the iib interpretation obtained by t-duality in the  direction.

16

the iib dual of a membrane wrapped once on each of the two cycles
of the torus relating the iib theory to m-theory is a (1,1) string [23].
in
our case the (1,1) string is bound to the d5-brane that is the iib dual of
the kk-monopole. the binding is due to the fact that the d5-brane at-
tracts (1,0) strings and is neutral to (0,1) strings. thus, there is eectively
a potential conning the (1,1) string to the d5-brane (as expected from the
v  k2 potential relevant to the iia description; in fact, the potential is t-
duality invariant [24]). given sucient energy, the (1,1) string could migrate
from one d5-brane to another one at some position in the transverse 4-space
specied by a 4-vector. in fact the supermembrane q-kinks discussed earlier
correspond to strings which begin on one d5-brane but then jump over to
another one. the charge 4-vector (q0, q) is just the position 4-vector of the
other d5-brane, as we now explain.

the triplet of kahler 2-forms associated with the 4-metric (6) is

 = (d + a  dx)dx  v dx  dx

(59)

where the wedge product of forms is understood. hence the triplet of topo-
logical charges q is given by

q = z ik = z dx

(60)

where the integral is over the (1,1) string worldspace. for v as given in (8),
the potential k2 has minima at x = x0, so a string that starts at one
minimum and ends at the other one has a 3-vector kink charge q = 2x0.
this is the same charge as in the iia interpretation. however, the noether
charge in the iia interpretation becomes a fourth topological charge in the
iib interpretation (cf.
[24]). to see this it is simplest to get to the iib
theory by rst compactifying on the  cycle followed by t-duality on the k
cycle. this leads to the s-dual of the conguration obtained from performing
these operations in the reverse order (i.e. a (1,1) string in a ns-5-brane), but
the result we are aiming at is unaected by s-duality. having compactied
on the  cycle, t-duality on the k cycle takes  to  , where  is the t-

dual coordinate, and hence takes the noether charge q0 = r v 1  to the

topological charge

q0 = z d  .

(61)

this result is to be expected from the fact that the transverse space of the
iib d5-brane is 4-dimensional. thus, in the iib theory the q-kink charges
(q0, q) become a single topological 4-vector charge q = ( q0, q). a congu-
ration for which this charge is non-zero represents a (1,1) string that starts at
one d5-brane and then migrates to another one positioned at some distance
|q| from the rst in the direction given by q.
