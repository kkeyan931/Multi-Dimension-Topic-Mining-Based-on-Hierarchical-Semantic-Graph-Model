we use the earlier results on the correlations of axial gauge greens
functions and the lorentz gauge greens functions obtained via nite
eld-dependent brs transformations to study the question of the cor-
(k)p - type singularities in the axial gauge boson
rect treatment of
propagator. we show how the known treatment of the
(k2)n -type sin-
gularity in the lorentz-type gauges can be used to write down the axial
propagator via eld transformation. we examine the singularity struc-
ture of the latter and nd that the axial propagator so constructed
has no spurious poles, but a complex structure near   k = 0.

the known high energy physics is well represented by the standard model
(sm): a nonabelian gauges theory. hence, the importance of feynman di-
agrams calculations in nonabelian gauge theories need not be elaborated.
among the gauges commonly used in such calculations are the lorentz-type
and the axial-type gauges. the former are commonly used on account of
simplicity of feynman rules, lorentz covariance and possibiltiy of testing
gauge-independence. axial gauges have also been frequently used in sm cal-
culations on account of the ghost-free nature which cuts down the number of

feynman diagrams to be evaluated. axial gauges suer from lack of manifest
covariance and more imporantly the spurious
(k)p singularities in the propa-
gators. various treatments for such singularities have been proposed such as
principle value prescription (pvp)[1] and the mandelstam-leibbrandt (ml)
prescription [2]. they are of an ad-hoc nature and while they are successful in
many calculations, they lead to a number of diculties [3] especially for the
light-cone gauge. (lcg). a prescription for gauges of the form a1 + a3 = 0
(lcg not included) has also been derived using canonical quantization [4].
(k)p -type singularities in
the path-integral formulation in a dierent way. unlike the pvp and the lm
approach, our approach is to derive the treatment of axial gauge propagator
poles (and in fact attempt to obtain the correct way to do axial gauge cal-
culations) by using the connection of axial gauge greens functions with the
corresponding lorentz gauge calculation established earlier in [5]. unlike [4],
our approach includes lcg also.

we approach the problem of interpreting the

1

the basic idea (as outlined in [6, 7]) is as follows. in lorentz-type gaues,
there are also spurious singularities at k2 = 0 (except the feynman gauge).
we correctly deal with these by the k2  k2 + i treatment, which ammounts
to an addition of a terms (a2/2  cc) to the action. as is well known,
the a2/2 term provides a damping in the euclidean formulation of the
path integral for the generating functional of lorentz-type gauge theories.
the minkowski space generating functional is obtained by wick rotation
leading to eective replacement k2  k2 + i in the gauge and ghost prop-
agators. we now propose to use this well-dened treatment in lorentz-type
gauges by performing a eld transformaiton (on gauge and ghost elds) that
converts the lorentz and axial gauge generating functionals. such a eld
transformation has been established in [6] based on an earlier work [8] and is
a eld-dependent generalization of brs transformation called finite field-
dependent brs (ffbrs) transformation. the idea of such a transformation
was used to correlate arbitrary greens functions in axial-type gauges to those
in lorentz-type gauges in [5]. the result reads:

where 1,i and 2,i are dened in [5] in terms of brs variations of i, and sm
e
is the f.p. eective action for the mixed gauge function [  a(1 ) +  a].
the basic idea is to use (7) to relate the axial and lorentz gauge propagators.
the only shortcoming of the above relation is that it does not include the
a2/2 + cc terms in the lorentz gauge eective action. the modication
of (7) due to this term can be obtained using the reverse of (1) itself. we
rst do this below.

the lorentz gauge vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude w , with  terms in-

cluded reads:

w l = z deisl

e []+io1[]

with o1  r d4x(cid:18)a2/2 + cc(cid:19). we look upon eio1 as o in (1) to arrive at:

functions are then computed with the -dependent eective action sa

1[], viz:

ho[]ia = z do[]eisa

e []+io

1[].

(11)

it turns out to be unnecessary to know the form of o
1 explicitly [9]. one
can relate the greens function ho[]i to the corresponding lorentz gauge
quantities by the procedure established in [5] and the result is simply:

hoia = hoil
+z 1

(12)

thus, in this form, the only eect on the second term is to modify sm
e

by r (a2/2  cc)d4x inside -integration.

we now employ the result (12) for the propagators. we set o[] =

we shall now state an important convention in dening the square roots in

(19). the square root y has branch points at r i2[(1i2)3+(1i2+i23)
and these lie a distance o() away from the origin [for lcg, in the k2 = 0
subspace, however, y = i1 has no branch cut in 1-plane]. we choose
the branch cut joining these. to obtain the value of +y at any point  
not on the branch cut, we consider y for 1 = m  as m  +. then
we can ignore  terms in this case and y = q2
1. this, we dene to be
i1. we then dene y for 1 =   by requiring that the phase of y is a
continuous function of m for 1  m < . from this and from the fact that
1), we learn that y (1) = y (1). hence, 2(1) = 1(1).
y  y (2
we further note that this prescription denes uniquely y for real   k 6= 0
since the branch cut cuts the real   k axis only at the origin   k = 0.
of the same form

we further note that both the kk and the k terms involve an integral

(21)

the constant  being dierent for the kk and k terms. this can be
evaluated and reorganized as:

1  12(cid:21)(cid:19).(22)

(2  a1)(2  1)

in the second term, we note that under 1  1,
ln(cid:18) 2  21

1

(23)

is invariant under as 1  2. using this and the necessary bose symmetriza-
tion implicit in (17), it can be shown that [9] this term does not contribute
to (17) as   0. [in the lcg, however, special care needs to be exercised in
the subspace  k = k2 = 0. we must follow one of two options: (i) take limit
  0 in the end of calculation, or (ii) interpret lcg as the limit 2  0
taken in the very end of the calculation. (then we may set  = 0 in the
beginning)] hence the propagator (17) is given in terms of the rst term in
(22):

a1 + 

(a1  2)(a1  1)

ln(cid:20) 1  1a1
a1  a11(cid:21)

(24)

substituted for (21) in (17). hence, we shall study the structure of (24) in
detail. the singularity structure of (24) is dependent on the denominators
and the logarithm. the equation (24), in general reads:

a1 + 

i2(1  )p (1)

ln(cid:20)

with

i(1 + 2)

 + i2(1  2) + 2
1  

2(1  ) + 3

.

(26)

the apparent complexity of (25) actually exists only in the small region of the
  k complex plane near the origin. we note that for |a1  1| < |a1(1 1)|,
the expression (24) can be expressed as

1

a1  1

ln(cid:20) 1  a11

a1  a11(cid:21) =

1

a1  a11

+ o(a1  1).

(27)

7

the condition |a1  1| < |a1(1  1)| implies
im(cid:18)q(  k)2  i2

k2+i(  k + ) (cid:19) >
q k2

1
2

(28)

and this covers all of real   k axis save the region (, 0) for 2 6= 0 and
(, ) for lcg. thus, (27) reads neglecting o() terms

1

a1(1  1)(a1  1)

.

for |  k| >> , this is easily seen to be

(1  i1)2(1 + 2
1)

22
1

(29)

(30)

and leads to the usual behavior of the axial propagator when substituted into
(17), which then reads:

  g0l
g0a

 = 

1

k2 kk(cid:18)(k2 + 2)
(  k)2 +

(1  )
k2 (cid:19) +

k[]+
k2  k

.

(31)

we now turn to the analytic structure of (25) near 1 = 0 on the real   k
axis. we note: (i) p (1) has no zeros on the real   k axis. [for the lcg, we
need to exercise care in the k2 = 0 subspace. here we need to take the limit
2  0 at the end to avoid singularities in this subspace.] (ii) the apparent
complexity of (25) is substantially reduced if we set  = 0 [which is the limit
we mean to take anyhow]. then (25) reads:

a1 + 

i2[2

1 + 2i1(1  i2) + i2(1  i2) + 3]

(a1 + )(k2 + i)3

=

i[(  k)2 + 2ik2  k + ik2 + 2(k2 + i)]

(cid:21)

ln(cid:20) i(1 + 2)1  i2
q2
q(  k)2  i2s k2
k2 + i(cid:21).
ln(cid:20)

1  i23
i(  k + )

(32)

the above expression can be used for 2 6= 0. for lcg, we need to excercise
care in the k2 = 0 subspace. we may either (i) take the limit 2  0 in the

8

end or (ii) we may keep  small in p (1) and express (25) as

a1 + 

ln(cid:20) i(  k + )

i(  k) s k2
k2 + i(cid:21)
i(  k) s k2
ln(cid:20) i(  k + )

k2 + i(cid:21).

(33)

i2[2

1 + 2i1(1  i2) + i2(1  i2) + ]

(a1 + )(k2 + i)3

=

i[(  k)2 + 2ik2  k + ik2 + (k2 + i)2]

expressions (32) and (33) have a (mild) logarithmic singularity at   k = 
and the expression (33) has in addition a logarithimc singularity at   k = 0.
thus, the singularity structure of the propagator is softened.

we summarize the view presented in this work briey:
(i) the propagator in axial gauge, naively calculated, has spurious singu-

larities.

(ii) the correct treatment of these singularities is obtained by relating
this propagator to the corresponding lorentz gauge treatment. this can be
done by using the ffbrs.

(iii) the propagator of (17) gives, however complex, the actual correct

treatment of these singularities.

(iv) while for |  k| >> , it gives the usual propagator, the actual
analytic nature of the propagator, in the vicinity of the origin is much more
complicated than indicated by various prescriptions suggested earlier.

(v) we may expect that the ills associated with the axial/lc gauge [3, 4]
my be cured if the structure presented here is taken into account. this will
be left to a later work.

we nally summarize our results. we nd:
