(3) eq.(3) also called haag expansion lsz formalism. stress equality (3) weak equality: must understood equality among matrix elements computed h. crucial point couple remarks need made. first, observe set elds must irreducible set; however, may happen elements set known since begin- ning. example might composite (bound states) elds even elementary quanta whose existence ignored rst recognition. computation matrix elements physical states lead detection unexpected poles greens functions, signal ex- istence ignored quanta. one thus introduces elds corresponding quanta repeats computation. way proceeding called self-consistent method. connection, note necessary one-to-one correspondence sets {i} {i}. happens fact set {i} includes composite particles. another remark that, already mentioned, qft fock space physical states unique: one may indeed several physical phases, e.g. metal normal phase superconducting phase, on. fock spaces describing dierent phases unitarily inequivalent spaces correspondingly dierent expectation values certain observables even dierent irreducible sets physical quanta; exam- ple, ferromagnets set includes magnon elds exist non-magnetic phase, etc.. thus, nding dynamical map involves choice fock space dynamics realized: words dynamics (i.e. heisenberg elds heisenberg eld equations) may generate dierent physical phases. defect formation boson condensation 5 suppose dynamics invariant group g transformations : (x) (x) = g  , (4) g g. invariance dynamics means heisenberg equa- tions (or lagrangian may derived) invariant (in form) transformations g. one says symmetry spontaneously broken vacuum state fock space h invariant group g one subgroups. eq. (3) implies transformed (4), (x) (x) = g  , g belonging group transformations g. g  = f (cid:2)g (cid:3) , (5) (6) happens, see below, g 6= g symmetry spontaneously broken, g group contraction g; sym- metry broken g = g. since g invariance group dynamics, eq. (3) requires g group free elds equations invariant, i.e. also solution (2). since eq. (3) weak equality, g depends choice fock space h (among physically realizable unitarily inequiva- lent state spaces). thus see original (same) invariance dynamics may manifest dierent symmetry groups elds according dierent choices physical state space. since process constrained dynamical equations (1), called dynamical rearrangement symmetry. specic, let consider, path-integral formalism, complex scalar eld (x) interacting gauge eld a(x) (anderson-higgs- kibble type model). lagrangian density l invariant global local gauge transformations: (x) ei(x) , a(x) a(x) , (7) (x) eie0(x)(x) , (8) respectively, (x) 0 |x0| and/or |x| . lorentz gauge ah (x) = 0 used. put (x) = 12 a(x) a(x) + (x) , . 6 giuseppe vitiello spontaneous breakdown symmetry introduced condi- tion h0|h (x)|0i v 6= 0, v constant put (x) (x) v. h(x) denotes heisenberg eld.

(12) goldstone theorem thus proved: symmetry spon- taneously broken (v 6= 0), massless mode exists, whose interpolating heisenberg eld (x). ng boson mode. since massless manifests long range correlation mode. notice ng mode defect formation boson condensation 7 elementary eld. models may appear bound state, e.g. magnon ferromagnets. note that v independent |v|, although phase |v| determines one v: ferromagnets, external magnetic eld switched on, system magnetized independently strength external eld. analysis two-point functions theory shows model contains massless negative norm state (ghost), besides ng massless mode , massive vector eld u . dynamical maps are: = : s : , (13) 1 (cid:20)v + z 2 in(x) + f (cid:21) : , (14) , (15) 1 z 2 v h(x) =: exp 3 u h(x) = z 1 2 in(x) 1 z 2 e0v in(x) + bin(x)+ : f  : functionals f f determined within particular model. relations weak equalities equivalent familiar lsz reduction formula. also used a0 h(x) e0v : bin(x) :. eqs.

(24) (25) (26) note in-eld transformations in-eld equations matrix invariant bh changed irrelevant c-number. thus see original invariance cannot lost even level physical elds, although manifest dierent symmetry group structure. eq. (25) shows physical eld translates constant heisenberg eld undergoes global phase transformation (and vice versa): global u (1) invariance group dynamically rearranged one-parameter constant translation group. last one group contraction global u (1). defect formation boson condensation 9 notice translation constant invariant transformation eld equation massless eld. thus rear- rangement contraction global u (1) group content goldstone theorem. also interesting note u (1) compact group contraction compact. since number operator eld changes translation (25) say coherent boson condensation. must stressed translation constant (25) must actually understood limit f (x) 1 transformation in(x, ) = in(x) + f (x) , v 1 z 2 (27) f (x) normalizable solution eld equation: 2f (x) = 0. eq. (25) induces infrared singularities feynman diagrams many momentumless energyless lines. smeared use (27). however, notice matrix elements well dened even (25) used. also, function f (x) appearing generator (27) makes well dened. since dierent physical phases (unitarily inequivalent representations) associated dierent ng boson condensation densities, see boson translations, inducing variation ng boson condensation, rep- resent transitions physically dierent phases. particular, discuss non-homogeneous boson condensation induced transformations (27). dynamical rearrangement symmetry studied many models physical interest. case global su (2) invariance group, example ferromagnets, systems isospin vector elds, ng boson condensation controlled e(2) group, group contraction su (2). unfortunately, lack space cannot report interesting cases. 3. observable eects non-homogeneous boson transformations translations bosonic physical elds (not necessarily massless) space- time dependent functions, say (x), satisfying eld equation translated physical eld, called boson transformations. eq. (27) thus example boson transformation. let h denote heisenberg eld obtained dynamical mapping physical eld undergoes boson transformation. 10 giuseppe vitiello boson transformation theorem proved, states h also solution heisenberg eld equation. proof theorem consists showing boson-transformed elds, say h, dier h dependent factor therefore solutions eld equations. absence gauge eld, boson transformation order parameter gets space-time dependence given 1 z 2 v v(x) = exp (x) 1 z 2 v v + v (x) , (28) expansion v(x) around (x) = 0 used (v (i(x)) 0 (x) 0). note modulus v changes limit const. phase changed. case gauge eld present, shown space-time dependence term eliminated gauge transformation (x) regular (i.e. fourier transformable) function eect appearance phase factor order parameter: v(x) = eic(x)v, c constant. conclusion gauge eld present, boson trans- formation regular (x) equivalent gauge transformation. contrary, theory global invariance only, non-singular boson transformations ng elds produce non-trivial physical eects (like linear ow superuidity). want stress that, case global phase transformations well case local gauge transformations, proof boson transformation theorem relies fact (x) regular function. one wants consider functions singularities (divergence topological singularities) one carefully exclude singularity regions integrating space and/or time. example, (x) singular axis cylinder (at r = 0) one must exclude singular line r = 0 cylindrical surface innitesimal radius. phase order parameter singular line. means sbs occur region (the core): normal state rather ordered one. provided one uses care, boson transformation safely (and advantageously) used also case singular (x). boson theorem relevant physical meaning since shows dynamics may describe homogeneous non-homogeneous phe- nomena. theory allows sbs, always exist solutions eld defect formation boson condensation 11 equations space and/or time-dependent vacuum. solutions obtained translationally invariant ones boson transforma- tion ng eld: results local bose condensation particles. directly leads us mechanism formation extended objects (defect formation). notice local gauge theories boson transformation must compatible heisenberg eld equations also physical state condition (21). boson transformation (x) = v f (x) z 1 2 2f (x) = 0, bh changes bh(x) bh(x) e0v2 z f (x) , (29) eq. (20) thus violated gupta-bleuler-like condition imposed. order restore it, shift bh must compensated means transformation uin: u in(x) u in(x) + z3 1 2 a(x) , a(x) = 0 , (30) convenient c-number function a(x). dynamical maps various heisenberg operators aected (30) since contain bh(x) combination changes bh u u compensate provided (2 + m2 v )a(x) = m2 v e0 f (x) .

(33) hand, f , related observables, single-valued, i.e.  f (x) = 0. recall f (x) solution equation suppose non-zero mass term: (2 + m2)f (x) = 0 . (34) denition g regularity f (x) follows f (x) = 1 2 + m2 g(x) , (35) leads 2f (x) = 0 implies = 0. thus (33) compatible massless equation in. quantity f (x) given (35) = 0. equation, f (x) determined. topological charge dened nt = zc dl f = zs ds f = 1 2 zs ds g .
