abstract

we study junctions of supersymmetric domain walls in n = 1 supergravity theories

in four dimensions, coupled to a chiral supereld with quartic superpotential having z3

symmetry. after deriving a bps equation of the domain wall junction, we consider a

stable hexagonal conguration of network of brane junctions, which are only approximately

locally bps. we propose a model for a mechanism of supersymmetry breaking without loss

of stability, where a messenger for the susy breaking comes from the neighboring anti-bps

junction world, propagating along the domain walls connection them.

for many years it was believed that the extra dimensions, as are required from
string/m-theory, are compactied with sizes of order of 1033cm. the ensuing dispar-
ity of the electroweak scale of 103gev and the planck energy scale of 1018 gev made

impossible to directly probe the regimes of quantum gravity.

meanwhile an alternative idea of our matter made of zero modes trapped on a topo-

logical defect (3+1)dimensional, embedded in a higher dimensional universe was also pro-

posed[1][2]. recent proposals of large extra dimensions in a similar philosophy has provided

exciting new possibilities of addressing long standing problems such as cosmological con-

stant problem, hierachy problem and supersymmetry breaking[3]. explicit realization of

the idea was presented in refs.[4][5]. the basic tenet of these works is that the standard

model resides on a 3 dimensional brane or intersection of branes in the higher dimensional

spacetimes where as the gravity is progating throughout entire dimensions. for the sim-

plest model of thin branes intersecting, it was shown that the gravity indeed localizes on

the intersection[6][7][8].

it would be satisfactory if we could model this brane (or intersection/juction of branes)

from a higher dimensional theory, where the brane is a stable solution of a nonlinear

equation, having origin in supergravity or string/m-theory. models of smooth solution has

been considered in ref.[9][10]. here they considered ve dimensional gravity coupled to

a single scalar to model a stable domain wall, without supersymmetry. however, further

eorts to obtain the smooth solutions directly from d = 5 n = 2 supergravity theories

runs into problems such as curvature singularity on the location of the brane[11]. d = 5,

n = 8 gauged supergravity theories were also considered[12]. also a distribution of d3

branes were considered[13]. the constraints to these models of brane world should also

come from phenomenology point of view.

the model we will be considering in this letter will be that of domain wall junction.

just as a bps domain wall breaks half of the supersymmetry, there are bps domain

wall junction congurations which break one quarter of supersymmetry[14][15]. in these

congurations, stability is directly linked to the supersymmetry of the system. so, one

phenomenological question which arises in this context is how to break supersymmetry,

without losing the stability of the conguration. here, we propose a way of achieving both,

stability as well as breaking of supersymmetry. for this purpose, we consider a network of

junctions. actually there is a work on innite network of junctions of domain walls which

are only locally approximately bps states[16]. such a network enjoys stability against local

uctuations, as well as the domain wall thickness does not exceed the size of the domains

1

bound by them. however, it has been been done in the context of rigid supersymmetry.

so in order to apply to the brane-world senario, we rst have to establish similar bps

objects within the context of supergravity.

let us consider the simplest model which has a single at 3-brane embedded discon-

tinuosly in the ambient geometry[3].

(2)

which is inspired by supergravity[17].

the advantange of the form is that the spacetime is now specied by the solution

of the nonlinear equation for the dilaton, in the absence of the gravity[18]. we then can

integrate the second equation for the metric. at the critical points of the superpotential,

the potential is negative, and we do have anti-de sitter space. the stability equations of

small uctuations take the form of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and are devoid of

harmful tachyonic modes.

we would now like to explore the possiblity of having a similar smooth solution for the

case of intersecting branes or junctions of them. one of the motivation for this is to have

nontrivial tension on the junction itself, which might aect the gravitational eld nearby.

(however, it will not aect the asymptotic geometry because, the junction energy will be

source of gravity in one higher dimensional space than the branes.) another is to have a

stepping stone model to a more string theoretic explanation of the brane conguration.

in order to have intersections/junctions which allow a four dimensional minkowski

spacetime at the overlapping region, we need to have at least two large extra dimensions and

two real scalars. the simplest would be the junction of three 4 branes in six dimensional

embedding space. the strategy is thus to consider a six dimensional gravity coupled to

two real scalars with some potential, which has at least three minima, which allows brane

junctions. analogous to the domain wall case of ve dimensions, we want to nd the form

of the potential which makes the bps equation of the scalar elds satisfy bps equation

for junction in the absence of gravity[18].

we can calculate the metric by quadrature, and at the vacua, when the derivative of the

superpotential vanishes, we have automatically ads space in the asymptotic region. so

we rst have to study bps equations for intersecting domain walls, in the absence of

gravity[14]. for this we have to generalize the system to that of complex scalar and two

extra dimensions.

as a toy model we consider the 1 + 1 dimensional brane world. this can be achieved

by considering n = 1, d = 4 supergravity theories which allow domain wall solutions[19].

for that purpose, consider an n = 1 d = 4 globally supersymmetric eld theory of a chiral

supereld  with a complex scalar eld  and a fermion , which arises as an eective eld
theory. the bosonic part of the lagrangian is in terms of the kahler potential k(, ),

and a holomorphic superpotential w ():

l = abk ab   k  |w ()|2.

(4)

this model was studied in ref.[14][15] and was shown to admit brane junction solutions,

when there are more than three minima of the superpotential. these solutions admit one

quarter of the supersymmetry, with a single hermitian supercharge. the issue of junctions

and supercharge was also studied in ref.[20].

the anticommutators of two left handed supercharges has central charges as follows:

{q, q} = 2i(k 0)

zk.

(5)

the anticommutators between left- and right-handed supercharges has a contribution from

other supercharges yk, k = 1, 2, 3,

{q, q } = 2(

 p + k

 yk).

(6)

where p are the energy momentum four vector. zk are complex and yk are real. if we

have single domain wall which is nontrivial only in one dimension, then yk vanishes and

zk is non-vanishing. however, when the eld conguration at innity is nontrivial in two

dimensions, as in the cases of domain wall junctions, yk can be nonvanishing. this is

actually proportional to the area in eld space spanned by the elds of the solution, as

measured by the kahler metric, and is the junction mass[15], and can have negative values

also[20].

3

now let us consider an n = 1 locally supersymmetric theory, whose bosonic part is

given as follows:

e1l = 

1
2

r + g k    ek (k  |dw ()|2  3|w|2).

(7)

where e = |detg|1/2, and dw = e1(ek w ). the convention we are adopting are
those of ref.[19], where  = e
a a where a are the at spacetime dirac matrices satisfying
{a, b} = 2ab. a = 0, 1, 2, 3. we also have put 8g = 1. we use the weyl basis for the
2 (1  i 5), and k   = 1/ k,
gamma matrices. the projection operators are pr,l = 1
and k, = k.

existence of domain wall for the simplest case of z2 symmetric case was demonstrated

in ref.[19].

k =  , w =

1
3

3  a.

(8)

for the junctions to exist, we need at least three extrema of the superpotential, so we

consider the following:

k =  , w =

1
4

4  b.

(9)

in the global case one has three isolated minima at n = b1/3e2ni/3, n = 0, 1, 2.
ref.[19], it was argued that domain walls cannot exist in such a theory, because all the

in

geodesics in the space of the superpotential has to go through the origin, which is not a

vacuum. however it turns out that we can have bps domain wall junctions which has two

spatial coordinate dependences rather than one as in the cases of domain walls of ref.[19].

to see this we rst obtain the bps equation for the scalar eld. this comes from the

vanishing of supersymmetry transformation of fermion of the chiral supereld. the spin

1/2 eld  transforms as

2ek/2k  (d 

 = 

w pr + dw pl)  i2(pr +  pl),

(10)

and the gravitini transform as

 = (cid:20)2( +

1
2

ab

 ab) + iek/2(w pr + w pl)  im(k,) 5(cid:21) .

(11)

since we are interested in constructing static brane junction solution, which in the

thin limit gives us the patches of ads spaces[6], the ansatz for the vierbein we choose is

4

ea
 = diag(a1/2(x, z), a1/2(x, z), a1/2(x, z), a1/2(x, z)), which has just a conformal factor,
for the spacetime metric:

ds2 = a2(~z) dxdx.

(12)

in order to satisfy the bps equation one has to have  = (1, i1, 1, i1) where
 = 1. we will call the solutions of  = 1 case a bps conguration and  = 1 case an
anti-bps conguration.

the bps equations we nd are

w

aek/2k  d 
 = 0 : (x + iz) = 
x = 0 : (x + iz) log a = 2aek/2 w ,
y = 0 : z log a = 2im(k,x) + 2iek/2 wa,
z = 0 : (x + iz) log a = 2aek/2 w ,
t = 0 : x log a = 2im(k,z)  2ek/2 wa.

(13)

just as in the case of the domain walls, these equations satisfy einsteins equation, and in

the thin limit we have three domain wall junctions with angles of 2/3 xed. here we no

longer have the constraint on the geodesic on w space, and wall junctions exist. we see

that the scalar eld will be solved as a function of x + iz. unlike the rigid superymmetric
case, here we have nontrivial coupling to the gravity through a and it is in general dicult
to solve it analytically. however, it inherits the general structure of bps equations of rigid

supersymmetric case[14].

one can imagine that there can be other types of superpotentials which admit domain
junction, such as w = 5/5  2/2, which has four extrema, three at the edges of an
equilateral triangle and one at  = 0. in 1 + 1 dimensional case, it was shown that the

kinks interpolating the edges of the triangle does not exist[21], based on the existence of

an intersection number of two cycles around the extrema. it would be interesting to have

similar arguments for the higher dimensional cases.

note that unlike the domain wall case, the relative phases of the components of the

spinor are completely xed, signaling further breakdown of supersymmetry. however, the

fact that there is a consistent bps equation available shows that there is still some super-

symmetry available, which is one quarter of the original supersymmetry. as mentioned

earlier, there will be a contribution to the central charge of supersymmetry algebra, which

will be interpreted as the junction energy. the contribution from the junction energy

will not matter for the asymptotic geometry, because it will a source of gravity for one

5

higher dimension than the domain walls thus falls o faster. however, for detailed study

of evolution of the universe or other phenomenological studies, it might be of use.

the bps conguration of junction of three domain walls exists even in the context

of supergravity. it will be straightforward to generalize this to higher dimensions. brane

world on a junction can be viewed as a model with two types of extra dimensions. one

is the directions transverse to all the domain walls and has truely the nature of the bulk.

the other is along the direction of the domain walls. in the model we considered there

is one such direction. this direction is dierent from the transverse directions to the

domain walls because, massless modes can still be captured here. so we need not have

only gravity mode along this direction. in fact, these massless modes can propagate along

the domain wall in the speed of light. now, on the junction, the massless modes can be

further trapped because the domain walls get thinner away from the junction. however, if

we have another junction within a nite distance, joined by one of the domain walls, then

the massless modes can travel over to the other junction with nite probability, because the

wall thickness will grow as we approach another junction. of course this would be dicult

to see in a model with thin branes, but within the smooth model we have considered

above, this is certainly the case. of course an explicit demonstration of this would require

a numerical study. all in all, there can be information exchange between the junctions, if

they are joined together by a domain wall.

now that we have a stable bps junction, we come back to the issue of breaking

supersymmetry. attempts of having a supersymmetry breaking mechanism was proposed

in ref.[22][23], which involve bulk messengers, either from a susy broken hidden sector, or

a supersymmetric source of a massive bulk messenger. it is not clear whether the stability

of the domain wall is not at stake with the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry. a way

of stablizing the conguration is to consider a network of brane junctions, forming an array.

given that a stable static triple intersection exists, one can also think about a networks of

domain walls. certain conguration of network is meta-stable, and for the case of z3 model

we have studied, bps junctions have to be joined with anti-bps junctions[16]. for the case

of z3 invariant theory, hexagonal domains, like graphite, was shown to be stable under local

uctuations. numerical simulation showed that it is stable, as long as the domain sizes are

greater than the thickness of the walls. we can have metastable conguration of hexagonal

structures. these are non-bps (but almost bps) congurations. maybe some of the eect

of the neighboring anti-bps junction give rise to the breakdown of supersymmetry at our

junction. if we have nite thickness of the domain wall, some of the massless modes can

6

propagate along the walls. so the presence of of the neighboring anti-bps junctions will

be known to us on a bps junction, by some messenger[22][23]. so this should give rise to

a way of having supersymmetry broken, without losing the stability against perturbations.

however, there is some dierence between the mechanism here and the ideas of ref.[22],

where one needs to have a spontaneously broken supersymmetry in a hidden sector residing

on the other brane, at a nite distance apart along the extra dimension. the physics on

the other brane world is much dierent from ours. here we do quite similar brane world.

this model can be regarded as a toy model of the mechanism proposed in ref.[23]. to be

more specic, on our junction world, one particular combination of original supercharges,

say, q1 is left unbroken, and the states will be invariant under the action of the charge. on

the other hand, the states originating from the neighboring anti-bps junction world will

be invariant by the action of dierent linear combination, say q2. then they will certainly

be not invariant under q1 and will be seen as a messenger of supersymmetry breaking. of

course, if the array forms a regular lattice, then there will be bloch wave functions along

the lattice.

numerical simulations of the hexagonal lattice shows that as long as the domain sizes

are greater than the width of the walls. the parameter which controls the supersymetry

breaking will be related to the ratio of the domain wall thickness with respect to the

domain size.

other messengers can come along the the domain walls from originating from the

neighboring junction and can be sources of approximate symmetries of our world. since

we have anisotropic extra dimensions we might be able to see some of the eects in high

energy collider processes[24].

another thing that the network of domain walls can aect is the cosmology of early

universe. numerical simulations of 3+1 dimensional cosmology which admits domain

walls and their junctions show that a network of domain walls quickly dominates the

universe[25][26]. this can be a problem for cosmology if the domain walls and their junc-

tions reside in our observed universe. however, if the domain walls are embedded in higher

dimensional universe, and we are living on the domain wall or on a junction, it is not go-

ing to be an immediate problem. senarios of cosmology can have phase transitons of the

domain wall congurations where the junctions dominate and where they do not.

while this paper was being typed the paper by s.m. carroll, hellerman and trodden

(hep-th/9911083) appeared which discussed the bps equations of domain wall junctions

with local supersymmetry in a great detail.
