abstract

the polysymplectic phase space of covariant hamiltonian eld theory can

be provided with the current algebra bracket.

as is well known, when applied to eld theory, the familiar symplectic technique
of mechanics takes the form of instantaneous hamiltonian formalism on an innite-
dimensional phase space. the nite-dimensional covariant hamiltonian approach
to eld theory is vigorously developed from the seventies in its multisymplectic and
polysymplectic variants (see [4, 5, 6, 13] for a survey). they are related to the
two dierent legendre morphisms in the rst order calculus of variations on ber
bundles.

recall that, given a ber bundle y  x, coordinated by (x, yi), a rst order

lagrangian l is dened as a semibasic density

l = l : j 1y 

n
 t x,  = dx1     dxn, n = dim x,

on the ane jet bundle j 1y  y , provided with the adapted coordinates (x, yi, yi
).
j 1y can be seen as a nite-dimensional conguration space of elds represented by
sections of y  x. the poincarecartan form

hl = l + 

i (dyi  yi

dx)  ,


i = 

i l,  = ,

can be dened as a lepagean equivalent of l which is a semibasic form on j 1y  y .
it yields the legendre bundle morphism chl over y of j 1y to the homogeneous
legendre bundle

zy = j 1y = t y  (

n1
 t x)

(1)

which is the ane
coordinates (x, yi, p

n+1
 -valued dual of j 1y  y , and is endowed with the holonomic
i , p). in these coordinates, the morphism (1) reads

(p

i , p)  chl = (

i , l  

i yi

).

the ber bundle zy is treated as a homogeneous nite-dimensional phase space of
elds. it is equipped with the canonical multisymplectic form

dy = dp   + dp

i  dyi  .

every lagrangian l denes the legendre map bl over y of j 1y to the legendre

bundle

it is equipped with the canonical

the relationship between the multisymplectic and polysymplectic phase spaces

is given by the exact sequence

0   
x

n
 t x  zy    0,

where z : zy   is a 1-dimensional ane bundle. given a section h of zy  ,
the pull-back hy is a polysymplectic hamiltonian form on  [3, 4, 13].

a natural idea is to generalize a poisson bracket in symplectic mechanics to
multisymplectic or polysymplectic manifolds and, as a nal result, to come to the
covariant canonical quantization of eld theory. dierent variants of such a bracket
have been suggested (see [9, 10] and references therein). the main diculty is
that the bracket must be globally dened. let us note that multisymplectic man-
ifolds, whose particular example is (zy , dy ), look rather promising for algebraic
constructions since multisymplectic forms are exterior forms [1, 2, 7, 8, 11].

nevertheless, the x = r reduction of the covariant hamiltonian formalism leads
to time-dependent mechanics, but not conservative symplectic mechanics [12, 15].
in this case, zy = t y and  = v y are homogeneous and momentum phase
spaces of time-dependent mechanics, respectively. the momentum phase space v y ,
coordinated by (t, yi, pi = yi), is endowed with the canonical degenerate poisson
structure given by the poisson bracket

{f, g}v = if ig  igif,

f, g  c (v y ).

(3)

however, a poisson bracket {h, f }v of a hamiltonian h and functions f on the
momentum phase space v y fails to be a well-behaved entity because a hamilto-
nian of time-dependent mechanics is not a scalar with respect to time-dependent
transformations, e.g., time-dependent canonical transformations. in particular, the
equality {h, f }v = 0 is not preserved under time-dependent transformations. as
a consequence, the evolution equation in time-dependent mechanics is not reduced
to a poisson bracket, and integrals of motion are not functions in involution with a
hamiltonian [12, 15].

at the same time, the poisson bracket (3) leads to the following current algebra
bracket. let u = uii be a vertical vector eld on y  r, and ju = uipi the
corresponding symmetry current on v y along u. in particular, ju is a conserved
nother current if a hamiltonian form

h = pidyi  hdt

is invariant under the 1-parameter group of local gauge transformations whose gen-
erator is the vector eld u [12, 15]. the symmetry currents ju constitute a lie
algebra with respect to the bracket

[ju, ju] = {ju, ju}v = j[u,u].

this current algebra bracket can be extended to the general polysymplectic case as
follows.

there is the canonical isomorphism

 = p

i dyi   :   v y 

y

n1
 t x),

(

where {dyi} are the ber bases for the vertical cotangent bundle v y of y  x.
let u = uii be a vertical vector eld on y  x. the corresponding symmetry

current is dened as a semibasic exterior (n  1)-form

ju = u = uip

i 

(4)

on the legendre bundle  (2). in particular, ju is a nother current if a hamiltonian
form h is invariant under the 1-parameter group of local gauge transformations
whose generator is the lift onto  of the vector eld u [4, 14]. the symmetry
currents (4) constitute a lie algebra with respect to the bracket

[ju, ju] def= j[u,u].

(5)

if y  x is a vector bundle and x is provided with a non-degenerate metric g, the
bracket (5) can be extended to any semibasic exterior (n  1)-forms  =  on 
by the law

[, ] = gg(i

i  i

i).

similarly, the bracket of semibasic 1-forms on  is dened [12].

the bracket (5) looks promising for the current algebra quantization of the co-

variant hamiltonian formalism.
