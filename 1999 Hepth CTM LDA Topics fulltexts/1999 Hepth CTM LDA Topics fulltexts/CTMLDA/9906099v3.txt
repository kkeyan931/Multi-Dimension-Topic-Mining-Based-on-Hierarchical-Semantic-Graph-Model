abstract

we analyse the leading logarithmic singularities in direct and crossed channel limit of the

four-point functions in dilaton-axion sector of type iib supergravity on ads5 in ads/cft

correspondence. logarithms do not cancel in the full correlator in both channels.

the conjectured duality between type iib string theory on ads5  s5 and n =4 su-
perconformal super yang-mills (sym) on the boundary of ads5 with gauge group su(n)

by maldacena [1] was a subject of enormous activity in last one and half year (for a re-

cent review see ref. [2]). in the large n limit with g2

y m n xed but large, string theory is

weakly coupled and can be approximated by type iib supergravity. supergravity partition

function on ads can be used to compute correlation functions of operators of boundary

cft in this limit. string theoretic loop correctons correpond to o(1/n 2) corrections to

correlation functions in sym. a precise recipe to compute this is given in [3, 4]. let i

0(~x)
denotes the boundary value of the eld i(~x, z) then the eld  operator correspondence is
< exp(r d4xi
0(~x)], where we have denoted bound-
ary points by a vector and z is the radial co-ordinate in ads and oi(~x) is the conformal

0(~x)oi(~x)) >cf t = zsugra[i(~x, z)|z=0 = i

operator corresponding to the bulk eld i(~x). boundary values of the elds couple to

local operators in boundary cft which acts as a source for the former. vaccum to vac-

cum amplitudes in boundary cft can be obtained from supergravity partition function by

taking functional derivatives with respect to eld i

0(~x) and setting it to i

0(~x) = 0 after

dierentiation.

two and three point functions [39] are uniquely determined by the conformal symmetry

upto an overall multiplicative factor. four-point (and higher) functions [1024] contain more

dynamical information then two and three point functions. four-point functions are found

to have logarithms of the conformally invariant cross ratios as two boundary points aproach
each other. the correlator < o(~x1)oc(~x2)o(~x3)oc(~x4) >, where o  t r(f 2 +...), oc 
t r(f f + ...) in the dilaton-axion sector of type iib supergravity is evaluated in ref. [24],

direct channel (t-channel) limit (|x13|  |x12|,|x24|  |x12|), where x12 = |~x1  ~x2| etc. , is
considered and logarithms do not cancel in the full correlator in this channel.

the leading logarithmic term is of the form

1

34)4 ln( x13x24

x12x34

(x2

12)4(x2

). the leading contribution

comes from an operator of dimension eight. it has been suggested [2, 24] (following witten)

that logarithams can be interpreted as o(1/n 2) correction to the dimension of non-chiral

1

double trace operators : oo : and : ococ : which are dual to two-particle states in iib

supergravity.

another interpretation stems from conjecture [25] that n =4 super yang-mills is a loga-
rithmic conformal eld theory (lcft). in such theories there are logarithms of cross ratios in

the four-point functions and logarithmis are related to degenrate logarithmic operators [26].

logrithmic operators have special two-point correlation functions [26, 27], with a structure

that has natural interpretation in ads [25]. this conjecture is further supported in [29]

for the case of ads3/cf t2 correspondence (see also [28] for a discussion of ads/lcft

correspondence).

if this is the case, then logarithmic conformal field theories are the

natural framework for ads/cft correspondence. lets note that in n   limit n =4 is
denately a lcft, as the double trace operators become degenerate with chiral primaries

of dimension eight. it is still an open question whether n =4 is a logarithmic conformal eld
theory for nite n.

the aim of this paper is to analyse the logarithmic singularity in crossed channels (s-

channel |x12|  |x13|,|x34|  |x13| and u-channel |x14|  |x13|,|x23|  |x13|) limits of the
full correlator . our result is that the leading logarithmic singularity in crossed channel also

does not cancel and the leading contribution comes from an operator of dimension eight. we

shall consider the quartic graph (dened below) and its direct and crossed channel limits

as the full correlator can be written as the sum of quartic graphs only with appropriate

kinemetical multiplicative factors [24].

consider the quartic graph d1324(~x1, ~x3, ~x2, ~x4) for contact interactions in adsd+1

corresponding to scattering of conformal operators in boundary cft with arbitrary dimen-

sions i

d1324(~x1, ~x3, ~x2, ~x4) = z dd+1z

below we consider the direct (|x13|  |x12|,|x24|  |x12|) and crossed (|x12| 

|x13|,|x34|  |x13|) channel limit of the quartic graph of the form dpp(~x1, ~x3, ~x2, ~x4).
dpp can be written as (see equations. (a.3) and (6.3) of ref. [24])

now the hypergeometric function 2f1[a, b; c; z] for asymptotically large values can be dened

by analytic continuation and has logrithams if (a b) is an integer [30,31]. we simlply take
the result from ref. [30].

the u-channel limit (|x14|  |x13|,|x23|  |x13|) correspond to s  1

2 and t  1 and is

given by the same expression.

the full correlator < o(~x1)oc(~x2)o(~x3)oc(~x4) > can be expressed in terms of quartic

graphs of the form dpp. we simply take the result from refs. refs. [2, 24].

where s is the conformally invariant variable as above.

using the results for leading logarithmic singularity in direct and crossed channel limit of

dpp, we can write the result for the full correlator.

in direct channel (x13  x12, x24  x12) limit we obtain the leading logrithmic term as

in s-channel (x12  x14, x34  x14) limit we obtain the leading logarithmic term as below

(17)

which is of the form

ilog 

1

(x2

13)4(x2

24)4 ln(

x12x34
x14x23

).

similarly in u-channel (x14  x12, x23  x12) limit the leading singularity is of the form

ilog 

1

(x2

13)4(x2

24)4 ln(

x14x23
x12x34

).

we conclude that leading logarithmic singularity in crossed channels is also due to an

operator of dimension eight. also we note that the co-ecient of leading singularity is same

in both s- and u- channels as expected and dierent from that one in t-channel. (direct

channel (t-channel) involes cc scattering and both crossed channels (s- and u-channels)
involve cc scattering where o  t r(f 2 + ...), oc  t r(f f + ...)).
