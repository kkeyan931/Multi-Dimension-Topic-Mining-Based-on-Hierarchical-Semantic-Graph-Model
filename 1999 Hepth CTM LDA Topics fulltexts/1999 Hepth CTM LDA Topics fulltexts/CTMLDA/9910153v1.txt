abstract

we investigate the superconformal transformation properties of the supercurrent as well as of
the superconformal anomalies themselves in d = 4, n = 1 supersymmetric quantum eld theory.
matter supercurrent and anomalies are coupled to a classical background of minimal supergravity
elds. on at superspace, there exist two dierent types of the superconformal ward identity
(called s and b) which correspond to the at space limits of old resp. new minimal background
supergravity elds. in the present publication we give particular importance to the new minimal
case. a general formalism is set up which is then applied to the massless wess-zumino model.

1 introduction

it is well-known that on at d = 4, n = 1 superspace there exist two dierent types
(called s and b) of superconformal symmetry breaking and correspondingly two versions
of the supercurrent [1, 2]. in a recent series of papers [3, 4, 5, 6], the s-type supercurrent
has been studied by coupling it to a background of old minimal supergravity elds, such
that the superconformal ward identity on at space corresponds to the at space limit
of a combined dieomorphism and weyl ward identity. by functionally dierentiating
with respect to the supergravity eld h  , the superconformal transformation properties
of green functions with one or more insertions of the s-type supercurrent have been
explicitly determined to all orders in perturbation theory for the wess-zumino model
as well as for sqed. it has been shown there that the anomalous breaking of weyl
symmetry on curved space may be expressed in terms of a local callan-symanzik equation,
in which all dynamical anomalies are parametrized by the  and  functions of the theory.
this equation already contains all information on superconformal anomalies of multiple
supercurrent insertions.

in the present article, the b-type supercurrent is considered in a similar way by using
a background of new minimal supergravity elds. furthermore, we also investigate the
transformation properties of the anomalous breaking terms b and s themselves.

this article is organized as follows. in section 2, superconformal ward identities on at
space are briey reviewed, including the two possible types of breaking terms. in section
3, the formalism of coupling the supercurrent as well as the breaking terms to external
elds is presented in a model independent way. the types s and b of the superconformal
ward identity are shown to correspond to the at space limit of old resp. new minimal
supergravity backgrounds. the transition from the old to the new formulation is achieved
by introducing an additional external eld l (which is linear and real) in a weyl invariant
way. the choice of parametrization of the new minimal supergravity is non-trivial here, the
primary requirement being the possibility to vary all elds independently. this problem
is solved by expressing l in terms of a at space chiral spinor supereld . by taking
functional derivatives with respect to the external supergravity elds, the transformation
properties of supercurrent and breaking terms are obtained. since all ward identities are
formulated o-shell and for arbitrary functionals, they may be applied to the classical
action as well as to the vertex functional. in section 4 we consider the massless wess-
zumino model in a perturbative approach using bphzl renormalization. a close analysis
of all possible breaking terms shows that the weyl invariant coupling of l is possible, such
that the formalism of section 3 may be applied.

2 superconformal ward identities

according to the noether theorem, for each continuous symmetry there exists a con-
served current. at rst, these currents are elds on minkowski space and are given in
terms of components of the superelds involved. as usual, the energy-momentum ten-
sor corresponds to translational invariance, while supersymmetry implies the existence
of a conserved current called supersymmetry current. this supersymmetry current qa
should be clearly distinguished from the supercurrent v  which is a supereld having the
energy-momentum tensor tab, supersymmetry current qa and r-current ra amongst its
components.

suppose we have a superconformally invariant action . then the supercurrent is itself

conserved in the sense that the ward identities

8iw = ava

16w = d v 

16 w  = dv 

(2.1a)

(2.1b)

(2.1c)

hold, where w = dw  d  w , and w is the local ward operator of superconformal
transformations. if  depends only on a chiral eld a, w is given by

w = 1

4da


a

12d(cid:18)a



a(cid:19) .

(2.2)

the meaning of w has been discussed in detail in [3]. at this point it is sucient to note
that w is a functional dierential operator such that w vanishes on-shell. thus the
divergence of va also vanishes on-shell, and va is a conserved current. equations (2.1b),
(2.1c) represent a decomposition of (2.1a) and are called trace identities.

in the superconformal case, conserved r-current, energy-momentum tensor and super-

symmetry current are given by

2ca
2a

ra = 1
qa = i
tab =  1

4v(ab) ,

(2.3a)
(2.3b)
(2.3c)

where

va(z) = ca(x) + a(x) +   a

(x) + b vab(x) + . . . .

(2.4)

let us now turn to the case of broken superconformal invariance. in this case, the ward

3

identities (2.1) contain additional breaking terms b and s:

where

8iw = ava  i(cid:0)d2s  d2 s(cid:1) ,

16w = d v   b + 2ds ,
16 w  = dv   b  + 2 d  s ,

d s = 0 ,

d2b = 0 ,

db  d  b  = 0 .

(2.5a)

(2.5b)

(2.5c)

(2.6a)

(2.6b)

the restrictions (2.6) on b and s ensure that  is still super poincare invariant. it has
been shown however [1, 2], that a conserved energy-momentum tensor and supersymmetry
current can be formed from the components of va only if either b or s vanishes2. the
decomposition (2.5b) of w into v , s and b is far from being unique. indeed, in all
known cases it is possible to eliminate b by a redenition of v and s. in some cases 
but not always  it is also possible to eliminate s by a redenition of v and b. the case
s = 0 is denoted as b formulation, the corresponding supercurrent as b-type supercurrent.
analogously, for b = 0 we have the s formulation and the s-type supercurrent. in the
superconformal case, both formulations coincide.

from (2.5a) it is clear that if s = 0 then (2.3) yields conserved currents. this implies
that the b formulation can only be possible for r-invariant theories. if s 6= 0,  may or
may not be r-invariant. furthermore r, q and t dened by (2.3) are not conserved as
(2.5a) shows. there exists, however, a dierent denition of conserved currents qa and
tab in terms of supercurrent components [1], given by

tab =  1

of old minimal supergravity are determined by the prepotentials h and , where h =
h aa is a real vector supereld and  = ej is chiral. on at space (h = 0, j = 0) they
reduce to the usual derivatives

da  (a, d, d ) .

(3.2)

in this paper we use the real as well as the curved space chiral representation. quantities
in the real representation are denoted by letters with a tilde, e.g. . the corresponding
expression in the chiral representation is given by  = eih . from the fact that this trans-
formation with eih does not commute with complex conjugation, there arises a notational
diculty. for example, the complex conjugate d of the chiral representation covariant
derivative d  is in the antichiral representation, while in the chiral representation it reads

e2ihde2ih .

superdieomorphisms are generated by vector elds

 = aa + d +   d  + m +    m  

(3.3)

(3.4)

which are subject to certain constraints, such that they may be expressed in terms of a
single parameter function (z) as

  = i d  ,

  = e2ih   ,

   =  d(  ) ,

the dieomorphism transformation properties of the supergravity prepotentials are given
by

(3.7)

where c = aa + d. super weyl transformations are local scalings of the chiral
compensator  but leave h invariant,

(3.8)

superconformal transformations are now conveniently characterized as those combined 
and weyl transformations which leave the at space choice h = 0, j = 0 invariant, i. e.

d2d ,

d  = d   .

(3.9)

transformation properties of functionals such as the classical action or the vertex func-
tional are most adequately expressed in terms of ward identities. local ward operators
are denoted by w, surrounded by some indices. the upper left index contains the elds
which are to be transformed, e. g. hw or jw or dynw for the dynamical elds (as opposed

5

to the background elds). the type of transformation is specied in the lower left posi-
tion: w for dieomorphisms, w for weyl transformations and w for combined  and
weyl transformations. integrated ward operators are denoted by w and are dened by

h

w  =z d8z (z) h

w(z) + c.c. =z d8z h  


h   + c.c. .

thus dieomorphism invariance of the action  is expressed by

for weyl transformations we include a general chiral breaking term s,

w + j

w(cid:1)  = 0 .

(3.10)

2 s .

we may now combine ward identities (3.11) and (3.12) by imposing the rst of constraints
(3.9), such that the inhomogeneous terms in the  and weyl transformation of j cancel.
this means that in the at space limit there is no contribution from j. however, the
inhomogeneous term in the local ward operator for h,

(3.13)

(3.14)

which is exactly the s-type superconformal ward identity since v  = 8 
h   . by dier-
entiating once with respect to h   before restricting to at space and by integrating with
the parameter function 
conf (z) for conformal transformations, one obtains the transfor-
mation properties of the supercurrent (see [3] for details),

(3.15)

(3.16)

(3.17)

here we have assumed that the dynamical elds transform independently of h, as is the
case for chiral scalar elds. otherwise additional terms may be present. conf and  are
the solutions of (3.9).

next we aim at a curved space extension of the b formulation of the superconformal
ward identity. it turns out that this is achieved by using the curved space formalism of new
minimal supergravity which is obtained from the old minimal formulation by introducing
an additional external eld l which is linear and real. we proceed in two steps. in the

6

rst step, a real external eld without the linearity constraint is coupled to the breaking
term s. as a by-product, this allows the calculation of the conformal transformation
properties of s itself.
in the second step, the linearity condition is employed. since
functional derivatives with respect to constrained elds are not well-dened, the linear
eld l is expressed in terms of a at space chiral spinor eld which turns out to couple
directly to the b breaking.

3.2 coupling of the weyl breaking to an external eld

we introduce an additional external eld l which is restricted to be real. in the chiral
representation this means

l = e2ih l ,

(3.18)

thus l is subject to an h-dependent constraint and cannot be varied independently from
h. it is therfore preferable to transform l back from the chiral to the real representation,
i.e. to use

l = eihl

(3.19)

instead of l as independent eld. l is a real eld in the usual sense,

l = l .

by denition l transforms under  transformations as a scalar eld,

which yields together with the transformation of h (a.1.2) the transformation of l:

l = l ,

(3.20)

l + (1)


 l = (0)
l + o(h 2)

the weyl transformation of l is dened as

 l = (cid:0)eih + eih (cid:1) l .

(3.24)

(3.25)

(3.26)

the new eld l is useful if it can be coupled in such a way that the theory under
consideration becomes weyl invariant up to purely geometrical terms. this is not always
possible, a necessesary condition being r invariance of the original theory. futhermore l
should be coupled such that for l = 1 we come back to the original theory.

lets assume we have succeeded in introducing l as requested. then the following

ward identities hold:

(cid:16) dyn
w + hj l
(cid:16) dyn
w + j l

w(cid:17)  = 0
w(cid:17)  =  3

2 sgeom(h, j, l) .

for l = 1 this implies

(3.27a)

(3.27b)

.

(3.28)

(cid:0) dyn

w(cid:1)  = 0

2 sgeom(h, j) + d2(cid:18) 

 l

ei



h(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) l=1

this means that the dynamical anomalies of the original theory are now coupled to l,

sdyn(dyn, h, j) =  2
3

d2(cid:18) 

 l

ei



h(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) l=1

.

(3.29)

since the weyl breaking is now controlled by l we may condently put j = 0 and accept
the fusion of  and weyl transformations according to (3.9),

(cid:16) dyn
w + h l

w(cid:17)  =  1

8 dsgeom(h, j, l) .

on at space (h = 0, l = 1), the ward identity reduces to

w  =  1

(3.31)

3.3 conformal transformation properties of the s breaking

since at space is restored at l = 1, it is convenient to use l  log l instead of l, such
that at space corresponds to l = 0. the transformations of l are given by

(0)



l = 1
4

d {d, d }l + 1
4

d2dl + c.c.

l = (cid:0)eih  + eih (cid:1)

(3.29) translates into

d2(cid:18)

l

ei



h(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)l=0

ward operators for l may simply be obtained from (3.23) - (3.26) by noting that 
=
 l
. by rewriting (3.27) in terms of l, forming the conformal ward operator w (conf )
l1 
l
and dierentiating with respect to l, one nds the at space transformation law of the s
breaking.
theorem 1. in a model which is coupled to a real supereld l = eihel in a weyl invariant
way, the following ward identities hold at h = 0,  = 1, l = 0:

(3.36)

one might expect a contribution to (3.36) from the geometrical anomalies in (3.27b).

the only chiral term of dimension 3 containing only one eld l is given by

sgeom(h, j, l) = c d22l + o(l2) + o(h) + o(j) .

thus there is no contribution to (3.36) since

z d6z c d22l = c z d8z 2 l = 0 .

(3.37)

(3.38)

3.4 b formulation

a preliminary version of the b formulation may be obtained already at this point. we
use the relation

d d2 = 2 d [d, d ]  3 d2d

9

to rewrite sdyn as

1

8dsdyn(dyn, h = 0) = 1

2

d (cid:18) 1

3[d, d ]



l(cid:19)  1

4

d2d


l

.

(3.39)

it seems obvious to interpret the rst term on the right hand side of (3.39) as a contribution
to the supercurrent while the second term has the properties of a b breaking:

v b

  = 8(cid:18) 

b = 4 d2d

h    1

l

.

3[d, d ]



l(cid:19) 

using these denitions, (3.35) becomes

dyn

w =  1

16

d v b

  + 1

16 b .

(3.40)

(3.41)

(3.42)

furthermore, b as given by (3.41) obeys the constraint (2.6).

3.5 example: classical oraifeartaigh model

as a simple example we consider the classical oraifeartaigh model without spontaneous
symmetry breaking. this model describes three chiral elds a0, a1, a2, the at space
action being given by

on (old minimal) curved superspace this becomes

1(cid:1) + c.c.(cid:19) .

(3.43)

(3.44)

the weyl transformation of the dynamical elds is dened as

a0  e3a0 ,

a1  a1 ,

a2  e3a2 .

(3.45)

the weyl weights are chosen to t the non-conformal r-weights n0 = n2 = 2, n1 = 0
of a0, a2 and a1 (see [2]). our formalism automatically incorporates general supercon-
formal transformations with dilatational weights di =  3
2ni dierent from the canonical
dimension 1 of the elds.

now we introduce the real supereld l. obviously

is weyl invariant. the eld l = eih l has been used in the chiral representation as
an abbreviation. however it shall be understood that l is viewed as independent eld.
furthermore we have put j = 0. now the ward identity

ak

w =  1

16

holds, and v b

  and b may be calculated using (3.40), (3.41),

this coincides with the known b type ward identity in [2].

nk(akd d  ak + ak d dak)

the oraifeartaigh model is also well suited to check (3.36). the s breaking is given

(3.47)

(3.51)

which may be independently checked by applying the transformation laws of a0, a1, a2
on (3.50).

3.6 b formulation and new minimal supergravity

so far the b formulation has the disadvantage that the b-type supercurrent doesnt couple
directly to h   but is rather given by a combination of functional derivatives with respect
to h   and l (3.40). even worse, b depends only on some components of 
while other
l
components are actually not needed. both drawbacks may be xed by restricting l to be
a real linear supereld. by imposing this restriction we end up in a background of new
minimal supergravity. for the formalism of new minimal supergravity, see [7, 8, 9].

there is however the technical complication that it is not possible to functionally dier-
entiate with respect to a linear supereld. thus the linearity constraint has to be solved
by expressing l in terms of unconstrained elds. as a rst step, l is expressed in terms of
a real at linear supereld l0. again, we cast l into the real representation l = eih l.
we have to solve the equation (for j = 0)

0 = ( d 2 + r)eih l = d2(cid:16)e 1eih l(cid:17) .

(3.52)

11

one might be tempted to identify l0 with the term in brackets on the right hand side of
this equation, however this expression is not real. a real expression for l0 is obtained by
the following manipulations,

0 = d2(cid:16)e 1eih l(cid:17) = d2(cid:16)( e 1 l) ei

h is the inverse vierbein determinant in the real representation.

where e 1 = e 1ei

l0 is restricted by

the second step is to solve this constraint by

l0 = l0 ,

d2l0 = 0 .

(3.54)

(3.55)

(3.56)
where  is a at chiral spinor supereld, d  = 0. thus the real, curved space linear
supereld l is now expressed in terms of h and the at space chiral spinor elds ,  ,

2(cid:0)d + d   (cid:1) ,

l0 = 1

l = l(h, , ) .

(3.57)

,   are not subject to any further constraints and are thus well suited as independent
elds to formulate ward identities with3.

by expressing l0 in terms of , , an additional gauge invariance has occurred: the

replacement

   + i d2dk ,

      id2 d k

with k = k

(3.58)

leaves l0 invariant. we denote this invariance as k-gauge invariance.

to further evaluate the connection between l and l0, we decompose the dierential

operator which acts on l in (3.54) corresponding to the order in h,

l0 =



xn=0

y (n) l

(y (0) = 1) .

(3.59)

the explicit expression for (1)

l0 is lengthy and is therefore not displayed.

13

since it is not possible to functionally dierentiate with respect to a linear eld, ward
identities cannot be formulated in terms of l0. instead,  has to be used. in order to
nd the transformation properties of , l0 has to be rewritten as

l0 = 1

(3.68)

if we start from an action functional in which l is coupled in a weyl invariant way
(up to geometrical breaking terms), weyl invariance is of course still present when l is
expressed in terms of , i.e. the following ward identity holds:

w(z) + h

w(z) +  

(cid:0) dyn

w(z)(cid:1)  =  1

8 dsgeom(z) .

(3.69)

(3.69) is the basic ward identity for a eld theory coupled to the background elds of
new minimal supergravity, analogous to equation (3.12) for the old minimal formulation.
in the at space limit h = 0, l0 = 1, (3.69) reads

transformation of the index .

satises the usual constraint (2.6b) on the b breaking,

(3.80)

3.7 b-type supercurrent and energy-momentum tensor

energy-momentum tensor, supersymmetry current and r current have been given in
terms of supercurrent components already in section 2. now we reconsider the component
currents from the point of view of new minimal curved superspace.

there is no contribution from the b breaking if

(z) = d(z) ,  = 

or

d2(z) = 0 .

(3.81)

since we have super poincare and r invariance, the corresponding at space transforma-
tion parameters can be written in this form, while for k, d and s transformations this
is not possible,



conf = d + d   +  2(cid:0) 1

where ta, q, ab, r, d, ka, s are the parameters of translations, susy transformations,
lorentz transformations, r transformations, dilatations, special conformal and special
supersymmetry transformations respectively. c is an arbitrary parameter which reects
the fact that translations may be represented in any of the forms  = d or d2 = 0.
in order to dene currents ra, qa and tab in terms of supercurrent components only, we
have to specify localized versions of translations, r and supersymmetry transformations
such that (3.81) holds. obviously, it suces to make the parameters ta, q and r in (3.83),
(3.84) x-dependent and stay with (3.82),

(3.87) together with (3.85) yields the component currents

8 ((2  c)vab + c vba(x)) ,

tab(x) =  1
qa(x) = i
ra(x) = 1

2 a(x)
2ca(x) ,

(3.88)
(3.89)
(3.90)

where vab, a and ca are the supercurrent components as dened in (2.4). we may
choose c = 1 in order to get a symmetric energy momentum tensor

this reproduces the currents (2.3) up to trivial factors.

tab =  1

4 v(ab) .

since the energy momentum tensor is given directly by the   component of the super-
current, the mechanism of its coupling to the vierbein should be quite dierent from the s
formulation. in new minimal supergravity we have j = 0, and the remaining background
elds may in a wess-zumino gauge be written as

b  i2b
h b = a ha
 = eia a(x)

 + i2   b  + 2 2ab

with  =  .

the metric tensor is given in terms of the linearized vierbein hab by

gmn = mn  2h(mn) + o(h2) .

(3.91)

(3.92)

(3.93)

since hab occurs only in h b, it clearly couples directly to the  -component of vb, i.e.
 couples to
to the non-symmetric energy momentum tensor (3.88). correspondingly, a
qa

 and aa to ra. using (3.93), we obtain the o-shell expressions for the currents

t(mn) = 2



gmn(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)at space

, qa = 2



a(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)at space

, ra = 1
2



aa(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)at space

.

(3.94)

though the denition of tab, qa and ra in terms of supercurrent components is dierent
in the s and b cases, the respective currents always couple correctly to the component
background elds. in the s case, however, the coupling relations hold only on-shell [5].

the wess-zumino gauge expression (3.92) for  translates into a corresponding ex-

pression for l0,

with

l0 = 1

2(cid:0)d + d   (cid:1) = b  abab

bab =  1

4(ab)



 + c.c. .

(3.95)

(3.96)

17

in order to clarify the role of the antisymmetric tensor eld bab, we consider the antisym-
metric part of the -component of the superconformal ward identity (3.74),

(ab)d(w)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0 + c.c. = 4


h[ab]

+ 1

2abcdc


ad 


bab

.

(3.97)

this shows that on-shell, bab does not couple to an independent eld.
(3.97) rather
expresses an invariance with respect to a kind of shift in the external elds, similar to the
 and
shift identity considered in [10]. in [10], the new minimal supergravity elds ea
bmn are used as background elds for a yang-mills theory in the component approach
on tree level. since, however, all transformations are formulated as brs transformations
with corresponding ghost elds, a concise comparison seems dicult. most likely, the two
approaches  if they are both formulated in the brs language and for the same model
 are equivalent in the sense that the slavnov-taylor identities coincide at least modulo
equations of motion.

m, m

l0 is invariant under the k-gauge transformation (3.58) which reads in the wess-zumino

gauge

this invariance gives rise to the ward identity

bab = bfa  afb .

from (3.97) we deduce that on-shell this means

a 

bab (x) = 0 .

0 = a 

bab = 4a 

h[ab] = 4at[ab] .

(3.98)

(3.99)

(3.100)

this shows again that the antisymmetric part of the energy-momentum tensor is sep-
arately conserved, corresponding to the fact that the parameter  (3.85) with c = 1
which leads to a symmetric energy momentum tensor, consists of two parts. one part
fullls d2 = 0, and the conservation of the corresponding part of the energy momen-
tum tensor is due to the chirality of b. the second part has the form  = d. its
contribution to the energy momentum tensor is conserved because of the k gauge ward
identity (3.58). thus the existence of a conserved symmetric energy momentum tensor
originates from (3.58), which in the wess-zumino gauge is expressed by (3.99).

4 quantized wess-zumino model

it has been shown in [3] that the massless wess-zumino model can be quantized in an
r-invariant way. since, however, this r-invariance is only manifest in the b formulation,

18

we would like to apply the formalism of the previous section to the wess-zumino model.
the classical action for the massless wess-zumino model on at space is given by

cl = 1

16z d8z a a + g

48z d6z a3 + g

48z d6 z a3 .

(4.1)

for quantization we use bphz renormalization in its generalization to massless theories
by lowenstein and zimmermann [11]. thus we have to include an auxiliary mass term

1

8m(s  1)z d6z a2 + 1

8m(s  1)z d6z a2 ,

(4.2)

which breaks superconformal invariance resp.  on curved space  weyl invariance. the
parameter s takes part in the bphz subtractions like an external momentum. therefore
the limit s = 1 may not be taken naively, but we have to use a zimmermann identity
instead,

[m(s  1)a2]  (cid:12)(cid:12)s=1 =x

u[]  |s=1 .

(4.3)

here, the sum extends over all possible insertions of dimension 3 except for the mass
term iteslf.  is the vertex functional, i.e.
the generating functional for 1pi green
functions, and the symbol []   denotes an insertion of the composite operator []
which is dened by zimmermanns normal product algorithm [12]. equation (4.3) is the
source of superconformal anomalies.

the most general dieomorphism and parity invariant eective action (in the sense of

zimmermann) on old minimal curved superspace is given by

where an index a means functional dierentiation with respect to a. the remaining
counterterm coecients are determined by demanding r invariance of the vertex func-

has been shown that the dynamical superconformal anomalies may be parametrized by
the  and  functions. however, the theory is not invariant under r transformations
involving an anomalous dimension . since we would like to apply the formalism of the
previous section which relies partly on r invariance, it is favourable here not to introduce
an anomalous dimension. the weyl ward identity then reads (using the notations of [3])

we proceed by introducing an additional external eld l into the model in the way
described in section 3.2. for the classical theory there exists only the trivial solution
which has zero mass and doesnt depend on l at all. for the quantized model, however,
it is a non-trivial problem to establish the weyl invariant coupling of l.

elds a, a and from h, j and l. since l is dimensionless, there are several innite tow-
ers of terms involving ln. in order to keep the discussion digestible, we decompose the
eective action into three parts,

e = dyn

e + lin

e + geom

e

,

(4.10)

e contains terms which are at least quadratic in a, a; lin

where dyn
e contains terms linear
in a, a and geom
comprises terms which depend only on the background elds h, j
and l. the treatment of linear terms is postponed until section a.2. *** since we will
consider only transformation properties of single insertions, geom
is not relevant and will
not be considered here.

a basis of integrated eld monomials  which is needed to write down the most general
dyn
e  may be found in table 4.2. we see that the terms ikin and i from (4.5) are extended
by an additional factor ln, while it is not possible to derive l-dependent terms from im
and ig due to chirality. l is dened by l = eihl = log l. it should be clear, however, that
the independent elds are a, a, h  , j, j and l.

(4.13)

in order to evaluate [ w dyn

e ]  , a zimmermann identity has to be used. the zim-
mermann identity (4.3) for [m(s  1)3a2]   contains all possible terms of dimension 3
which we divide into three parts,

(cid:2)m(s  1)3a2(cid:3)  (cid:12)(cid:12)s=1 = [dyn]  |s=1 + lin + geom .

all terms giving rise to true, non-local insertions are collected in dyn, while lin comprises
terms linear in a and geom contains purely geometrical terms,

(4.17)

as explained in section 3.2, we would like to have a weyl invariant theory (up to
geometrical breaking terms), such that the s-breaking is coupled to the external eld l
according to equation (3.34) . the basic idea is to choose the innitely many countert-
erm coecients in such a way that the complete breaking dyn is absorbed. this weyl
invariant coupling is established by the following theorem.
theorem 3. there exists a unique choice of z(n) (n  1), (n) (n  0) and of the linear
counterterm coecients such that

where sgeom is independent of a, a. the only remaining free parameters are z(0), g and
m.

2 sgeom(h, j, l) ,

w (cid:12)(cid:12)s=1 =  3

22

to zeroth order in l, the theory coincides with the r-invariant theory on old minimal
superspace, while to rst order the eective action is given by

8 u2z d8z e 1l (e2ih d 2e2iha + d 2e2ih a) .

proof. in order to reveal hidden dependencies between the zimmermann coecients, we
make use of the commutation relation [  w(z) , w(z)] = 0 which implies that

 w(z) sdyn(z) = w(z) sdyn(z) + o(k) ,

where k  1 is the lowest non-vanishing -order of sdyn,

sdyn = o(k1) .

(4.18) is equivalent to the consistency relations

(4.18)

(4.19)

= u


(n)  (n + 1)u



(n+1) + o(k)

(4.20)

note that the superscripts (n) denote the order in l, not in . in order to solve equation
(4.20) we dene

or inverted

comparison with (4.17) shows that all breaking terms are weyl variations and can be
absorbed into dyn

e by choosing

z(n) =  2

n u(n1)

kin

(n  1) ,

(n) = v(n)



(n  0) .

(4.26)

thus we have

i.e.

2 sgeom(h, j, l) + terms linear in a, a + o(k) ,

w (cid:12)(cid:12)s=1 =  3

sdyn = o(k) .

(4.27)

(4.28)

now the lowest non-vanishing order of sdyn is no longer k  1 but k, and in this way k
can be pushed higher and higher until sdyn=0 to all orders in .

putting l = 0, the zimmermann identity (4.14) becomes identical to the zimmermann

identity on old minimal curved superspace [3]. comparison of coecients yields

ukin = u(0)
kin ,

u = u(0)



,

u
 = u


(0) .

correspondingly, we have z = z(0),  = (0). (4.26) together with (4.21) yields the same
value for  which is also obtained by requiring r invariance. thus to zeroth order in l,
the model is equivalent to the r invariant theory of [3]. the coecients of the rst order
terms in l are obtained from (4.22), (4.26) as

(1) =  1

2(u + u

) ,

z(1) = 2ukin .

the linear terms will be treated separately in section a.2.

clearly, z(0) and g are the same as z and g in the theory without l and are xed by

the usual normalization conditions (4.6).

4.2 transformation of s

having achieved the weyl invariant coupling of l, (3.36) may now be applied to the vertex
functional of the wess-zumino model. using the expression for e|l1 of theorem 3, it
may be checked explicitly that the s breaking (4.8) is coupled to l according to (3.34).
on at space, (4.8) reduces to

2s =  1

(4.29)

(3.36) yields the transformation properties of the s breaking (4.29) for the at space
theory at s = 1,

aw (conf ) [s(z)]   = [(c  3)s(z)]    3

2z d6z (z) {s(z)  s(z)}  

(4.30)

the double insertion {s(z1)  s(z2)} is dened in the spirit of [5] by

which implies that the second derivative of e with respect to l is involved. terms of
second order in l in e contain the zimmermann coecients u(1)
, . . . which are not
present in at space nor in the old minimal curved space formalism of [3]. actual values
for these zimmermann coecients can be obtained by calculating feynman diagrams with
one external l-leg.

(4.30) holds for any choice of geometrical counterterms geom

. the geometrical coun-
terterms of rst order in l contribute to s itself, while the second order terms contribute
to the double insertion. due to dieomorphism invariance, the rst and second order
terms are related in exactly such a way that (4.30) is always true.

we pass over from  to z and obtain the transformation properties of green functions.

theorem 4. the superconformal transformation properties for the s breaking (4.29) of
the massless at-space wess-zumino model are given by

since we have not assigned any anomalous dimension to a, we have  in addition to

super poincare invariance  exact r-invariance, i.e.

p,q,m,rht s(z) xi = 0 .

(4.34)

4.3 b formulation

in order to obtain the b formulation, l has to be restricted to be a linear eld. this means,
however, that the basis of local eld monomials presented in tables 4.2, a.1, a.2 is no
longer linearly independent. it turns out that l (n)
(n) may be expressed
ib , l 
ib
in terms of the remaining basis elements. in the zimmermann terms lin
(a.2.6) and lin
ii
i
(a.2.12), these terms have to be omitted. dyn remains unchanged. correspondingly, the
most general eective action is given by

(n), l (n)
iic , l 
iic

e = dyn

e + lin i

e + lin ii

e

e as in (4.11) and lin

with dyn
iic = 0. the consistency
conditions for the new zimmermann identities are the same as in (a.2.8) and (a.2.13),
but with u(n)
(n) = 0. it is easy to see that still all breaking terms can
ib = u
ib
be absorbed, i.e. theorem 3 is also valid for linear l.

e as in (a.2.5), (a.2.11) with (n)

(n) = u(n)

ib = (n)

iic = u

b-type supercurrent and b breaking may be easily calculated by using

l(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)l0=1

we will not calculate transformation properties of multiple insertions of the b-type super-
current here. however, it is clear that for every additional insertion, higher zimmermann
coecients of the innite towers in (4.15), (a.2.6) and (a.2.12) will contribute. in this
sense, multiple insertions of the b-type current acquire new anomalies for each insertion.
the same is true for multiple insertions of the b-breaking b.

theorem 5. the superconformal transformation properties of the b-type supercurrent
and of the breaking term b of the massless at-space wess-zumino model are given by

ht v b

5 conclusion

the purpose of this paper was twofold. first, it was intended to set up a general framework
which gives control on the at-space supercurrent and on the superconformal anomalies by
coupling the matter theory to a background of new minimal supergravity elds. second,
this formalism should be applied to the massless wess-zumino model.

in section 3.2, the s breaking has been coupled to a real external eld l, and thus
access to the transformation properties of s was gained. by restricting the eld l to be
linear, one performs the transition from old to new minimal supergravity. the choice of
independent elds in new minimal supergravity is non-trivial, since it should be possible
to vary them independently and also to have well dened functional derivative operators,
which is both not the case for the original eld l. however, the problem has been solved
by introducing the at space chiral spinor eld . furthermore it turned out that this
formulation yields the b-type superconformal ward identity in the at space limit, that
the b-type supercurrent is directly coupled to h   and that the b breaking b is directly
coupled to . insertions of the b-type supercurrent as well as of the breaking term b
may thus be generated by functional dierentiation with respect to h   and .

this general framework has been applied to the massless wess-zumino model in section
4. the classical theory is conformally invariant, yet acquires anomalies upon quantization
due to the necessity of introducing an auxiliary mass term. renormalization of the model
with the additional external eld l involves several innite towers of counterterms be-
cause l is dimensionless. however, a systematical treatment of dynamical anomalies was
possible by using consistency conditions. especially the linear terms require quite some
work here. though these linear terms are of little physical importance for the at space
theory, they might very well become important in a theory with propagating supergravity
elds. furthermore their study is justied as further evidence for the vigor of the method
of weyl invariant coupling.

as a result, all dynamical anomalies could be absorbed into the eective action, such
that the formalism of section 3.2 could be used to determine the transformation properties
of the s breaking. conversely to the case of supercurrent insertions, the transformation
of insertions of s involves new anomalies originating in the innite towers of couterterms.
in the same way the transformation of the b-type supercurrent and of the breaking term
b involve new anomalies.

28

as opposed to the s formulation of [3], the b approach is technically more involved but
perhaps also more systematic. despite the fact that in the b formulation r invariance is
manifest, the conformal transformation properties of the s-type supercurrent are better
behaved in the sense that all anomalies even of multiple insertions may be expressed
in terms of nitely many zimmermann coecients. multiple insertions of the b-type
supercurrent acquire new anomalies for each additional insertion. the clarication of
these dierent characteristics of s- and b-type breaking constitute one of the main aims
of the paper, particularly in view of the suitable supergravity variables.

a.2 linear terms

we come back to the linear terms of equations (4.10) and (4.14) which have not been
considered so far. first we have to nd a basis of local chiral terms of dimension 3 which
are linear in a, a. since a chiral projection operator ( d 2 + r) has to be included, there is
room for two additional spinorial derivatives in order to have dimension 3. the problem
of nding all possible placements of these two derivatives such that linearly independent

d lmdln =

calculation of the weyl variation of lin ii

shows that the breaking can be completely

absorbed by xing the counterterm coecients

iia = v(n)
(n)
iia ,

iib = v(n)
(n)
iib ,

iic = v(n)
(n)
iic .

(a.2.15)

with the choice (a.2.10), (a.2.15), we have slin = 0 in (4.16).

the limit l = 0

the zimmermann coecients of 0th order terms in l are related to the zimmermann
coecients of the old minimal formalism (cf. (4.8) as follows

u1 = u(0)
ia ,
(0),
iia + u
u
2 = u
iia

(0),
u
1 = u
ia
(0),
iia

u2 = u(0)

(0) .
u2 = u
iia

the counterterm coecients to zeroth and rst order in l may be read o from (a.2.9),
(a.2.14) and the solution of (a.2.8) and (a.2.13),

(0)
ia  1 = 1
(1)
ia =  1
2(u

4(u

2)

(0)
iia  2 = 1
(1)
iia = u2
(1)
iib =  1

2 (u2 + u

2)  u2 .

again, we see that to 0th order in l, the counterterm coecients (4.9) are reproduced,
while the remaining breaking terms of (4.8) are coupled to l.

this completes the proof of theorem 3.
