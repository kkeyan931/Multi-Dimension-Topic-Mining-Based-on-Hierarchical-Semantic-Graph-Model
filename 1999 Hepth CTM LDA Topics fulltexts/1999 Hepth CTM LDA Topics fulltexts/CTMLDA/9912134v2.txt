(february 1, 2008)

the weak-eld expansion of the charged fermion propagator under a uniform magnetic eld
is studied. starting from schwingers proper-time representation, we express the charged fermion
propagator as an innite series corresponding to dierent landau levels. this innite series is then
reorganized according to the powers of the external eld strength b. for illustration, we apply this
expansion to     and    decays, which involve charged fermions in the internal loop. the
leading and subleading magnetic-eld eects to the above processes are computed.

i. introduction

particle reactions taking place in the early universe or astrophysical environments are often aected by the back-
ground magnetic eld or the excitations in the medium [1]. a typical example is the modication of neutrino index
of refraction in the early universe or the supernova [2]. there one needs to compute the neutrino self-energy in the
medium or the background electromagnetic eld or both. the neutrino index of refraction is then extracted from the
modied dispersion relation of the neutrino. another example is the plasmon decay     [1] where the decaying
photon acquires an eective mass through the eects of the medium or the background magnetic eld. with such
an eective mass, the above decay is kinematically permissible. furthermore, the behaviors of electron propagators
occurring in the internal loop of the above decay are also aected by the medium or the magnetic-eld. this also
leads to a modication to the plasmon decay amplitude. finally, a more recent example is the enhancement of
neutrino-photon scatterings due to the background magnetic eld [3,4]. at the lowest order in the weak interaction, it
is known that the amplitude for     is proportional to the neutrino mass [5]. hence the resulting scattering cross
section is rather suppressed. on the other hand, the presence of the background magnetic eld alters the structures of
internal electron propagators, such that     is non-vanishing at o(gf ) even in the massless limit of neutrinos.
specically, the     cross section is enhanced by a factor (mw /m)4(b/bc)2 due to a background magnetic eld
b [3,4], where mw and m are the masses of w boson and electron respectively; bc  m2/e is the critical magnetic
eld.
in the above processes, the relevant magnetic-eld strengths are often smaller than the critical value bc. therefore
it is appropriate to expand the decay width, cross section or other physical quantities in powers of b/bc. in the
literature, such an expansion is usually performed after the relevant amplitude is obtained [6]. for a more complicated
process, it is not always convenient to do so since the amplitude to be expanded may be very cumbersome. in this
article, we shall propose a more straightforward weak-eld expansion, which is performed directly on the charged
fermion propagator participating in the process. with the charged fermion propagators expanded, the physical
amplitude can be easily expressed in powers of b/bc. to perform such an expansion on propagators, we shall begin
with schwingers proper-time representation for a charged fermion propagator under a uniform background magnetic
eld [7]. it is useful to realize that schwingers representation can be recast into a series expansion in terms of landau
levels [8]. in the weak eld limit b  bc, we shall demonstrate that one can reorganize the innite series in powers
of the eld strength b. this is the expansion we are after.
this article is organized as follows: in sec. ii, we will review schwingers derivation of charged fermion propagator
in a homogeneous background magnetic eld. since the convention used by schwinger diers from the currently
popular convention, we shall repeat some relevant details of the derivation for clarication. we shall also illustrate
how to rewrite schwingers result as an innite series where each term is associated with specic landau levels [8]. in
the weak-eld limit, we shall demonstrate how to rearrange the above series in powers of the magnetic-eld strength b.

finally, some technical issues relevant to the phase factor in schwingers proper-time representation will be discussed
in this section. in sec. iii, we begin with a briey discussion on our earlier work [4], where the weak-eld expansion
technique is applied to     and its crossed processes in a background magnetic eld [3,9]. to further illustrate
the technique of weak-eld expansion, we also calculate the decay rates of     and the neutrino cherenkov process
   in a background magnetic eld. our results will be compared to previous calculations which are performed
using exact charged-fermion propagators in the background magnetic eld [1012]. a few concluding remarks are
presented in sec. iv.

ii. charged-fermion propagator in a homogeneous background magnetic field.

a. the exact propagator solution

the greens function g(x, x) of the dirac eld in the presence of a gauge eld a satises the following equation

(i 6  + e 6a  m) g(x, x) = (x  x),

(1)

where (x  x) is the diracs delta function and m stands for the mass of the dirac eld. we will follow the
technique employed in schwingers paper [7] which regards g(x, x) as the matrix element of an operator g, namely
g(x, x) = hx|g|xi. therefore, eq. (1) may be written as

with  = p + ea denoting the conjugated momentum, which obeys the following commutation relations

(6   m) g = 1,

[, x ] = ig,
[,  ] = ief ,

(2)

(3)
(4)

with f  a  a denoting the eld-strength tensors of the gauge eld. eq. (2) can be formally solved by
writing

g =

1

6   m

= iz 

0

ds (6  + m) exp[i(m2  6 2)s].

this integral representation for g implies that

2 e f . we observe that u (s) can be viewed as the unitary

g(x, x) = iz 
where u (s) = eihs with h  (6)2 = 2  1
time-evolution factor if one takes h as the eective hamiltonian that evolves the state |xi according to

dseim2shx|(6  + m)u (s)|xi

where s is the proper time variable. one can now rewrite g(x, x) as

|x(s)i = u (s)|x(0)i,

g(x, x) = iz 

0

dseim2s [hx(0)|(s)|x(s)i + mhx(0)|x(s)i] ,

(7)

(8)

where we have assumed (s) operates on |x(s)i and (0) operates on |x(0)i. we note that the operators x and
 satisfy

dx
ds
d
ds

= i [x, h] = 2,
= i [, h] = 2ef,

(9)

for a constant eld strength f . in the matrix notation, we may write dx/ds = 2, and d/ds = 2ef . further-
more the transformation function hx(0)|x(s)i can be characterized by the following equations:

2

ishx(0)|x(s)i = hx(0)|h|x(s)i,

(i + ea(x)) hx(0)|x(s)i = hx(0)|(s)|x(s)i,
 + ea(x)(cid:1)hx(0)|x(s)i = hx(0)|(0)|x(s)i,
(cid:0)i

with the boundary condition: hx(0)|x(s)i  4(x  x) as s  0. to evaluate eq. (8), we rst solve eq. (9) and
obtain

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

this solution implies

(s) = e2ef s(0),

x(s)  x(0) =(cid:0)1  e2ef s(cid:1) (ef )1 (0).

[x(s), x (0)] = i(1  e2ef s)(ef )1,

where k  1

4 (ef )2 sinh2 ef s. therefore, one has

ef  (x  x)k(x  x) 
with this result, one can solve the rst equation in (10), which gives

hx(0)|h|x(s)i =

the factor c(x, x) can be determined by substituting eq. (14) into the second and third equations in (10). since
the r.h.s. of these two equations are given by

one then arrives at

hx(0)|(s)|x(s)i =
hx(0)|(0)|x(s)i =

ef (x  x)(cid:21) c(x, x) = 0,

therefore c(x, x) is found to be

here c(x) and c(x) denote integration constants in x and x respectively. note that the integral a + 1
2 f (  x)
is a total derivative in the presence of a homogeneous eld if the rst homology group of the space-time m is trivial,
i.e. h1(m ) = 0 [13]. hence the phase factor is independent of the integration path connecting x and x. one can
further show that c(x) = c(x). therefore c(x) or c(x) has to be a constant independent of x and x. this
constant can be determined by applying the boundary condition hx(s)|x(0)i  4(x  x) as s  0. one obtains

c = i(4)2

note that the translation invariance is broken by the phase factor (x, x). note also that the phase factor (x, x)
vanishes if the path connecting x and x is chosen to be a straight-line. in addition, if the background gauge eld is
a homogeneous magnetic eld such that f12 = f21 = b, one can show that

we note that, in the limit of extreme eld strength, i.e. b  bc or b  bc, only part of the terms in eq. (39)
are relevant. in the strong eld limit b  bc, only contributions from the lowest landau level n = 0 need to be
kept. for the weak eld limit b  bc, we shall demonstrate that the innite series in eq. (39) may be reorganized
in powers of the magnetic eld b. therefore those terms with lower powers of b are more important in this limit.
to reorganize the series, we rst observe that

note that above formula for the expansion of k

directly from the combinatorial factor in the the expansion of (v + f )k  1 [14].
it is worthy pointing out that
k
v f (v = 0) = 0 for all odd number k and the value of k
v f (v = 0) when k is even can be computed directly. for
example one can show that 2
v f (v = 0) = 16f (v = 0). hence the order of k2 and
the order of k4 terms read k
6 ](i)k4. similarly, one can also show
that the order of kn term for the d term vanishes when n is an even integer while d term vanishes for all odd
integer n. hence, by setting v = 0 on both sides of eq. (43), we obtain

the rst term of eq. (48) is just the electron propagator in the vacuum, while the second term is its correction to
o(eb). the corrections with higher powers in eb can be calculated in a similar way. for example, to evaluate the
term g2(p) and g4(p), we need to compute a few identities. note that ck
3 = k(k 1)(k 2)/6 hence one can show that
p
k=0(x)k = 1/(1 + x)
which is valid for all |x| < 1. similarly, one can also show that p
3 (x)k3 = 1/(1 + x)4  4x/(1 + x)5 for
all |x| < 1. therefore, one can extract the o(e2b2) and o(e3b3) terms from the series expansion in eq. (41). the
result leads to the following contribution:

c. phase factor

in this subsection, we discuss how to treat the phase factor (x, x) as dened in eq. (22). first, we note that

(x, x) is reduced to

(x, x) = exp(cid:26)iez x

x

da()(cid:27) ,

(51)

if the integration path connecting x and x is a straight line. this choice of integration path is only for convenience
since the integration in eq. (22) is path independent provided that the vector potential a() is non-singular. second,
for a particular type of coulomb gauge:

a0() = 0,
b
2

a() =

(x

2  2, 1  x

1, 0),

the exponent r x

x da() vanishes, hence (x, x) = 1. therefore, by choosing the above coulomb gauge, the phase
factor (x, x) in the electron greens function can be disregarded. such a simplication is, however, no longer valid
for more complicated processes where more than one electron propagators are involved in the process. to illustrate,
let us consider an one-loop triangular diagram composed of three electron propagators. we denote vertices of the
diagram as p , q and r respectively. it is useful to recall that the full phase factor between two points p and q is

(p, q) = exp(iz p

q

dx(cid:20)a(x) +

1
2

f (x  q)(cid:21))

(52)

according to equation (22). here we use p  to denote the coordinate of the point p . similarly q and r denote
coordinates of the points q and r respectively. as discussed before, one can set (p, q) = 1 by choosing the special
gauge

(53)
with a0(x) = b/2  (x2, x1, 0) and aq(x) = b/2  (q2,q1, 0). similarly, one can respectively set (r, p ) and
(q, r) to unity by choosing the gauges

aq(x)  a0(x) + aq(x)

(54)
with ap (x) = b/2 (p2,p1, 0) and ar(x) = b/2 (r2,r1, 0) respectively. apparently, aq(x), ap (x), and ar(x)
are distinct from one another. hence they cannot be adopted simultaneously to set all phase factors to unity. in other

ap (x)  a0(x) + ap (x)
ar(x)  a0(x) + ar(x),

8

words, the phase factors shall give rise to a non-trivial contribution to the three-point amplitude. in fact this non-
trivial contribution can be understood in an alternative view. taking eq. (52) as an example, the integrand on the
r.h.s. of the equation can be written as a  a + 1
2 f x where a  adx, a  adx, and f x  f dx(x q)
are all one-form. one can easily show that a is a closed form, i.e.,

da = 0.

(55)

note that a is exact if the rst homology group is trivial, namely, h1(m ) = 0. to be more specic, if the gauge
function a(x) is regular everywhere, then the one-form a is also regular. therefore there exists a zero-form  such
that a = d is an exact form. as a result, the line integration which denes (p, q) is path independent. in our
problem, we need to compute the product of three phases: (p, q)  (r, p )  (q, r). it is then important to note
that the one-form a in each of the above phases depends on the boundary point of the path, despite the fact that the
gauge function a(x) is regular. in other words, the gauge of a is chosen dierently in each path, which then gives
rise to a non-trivial phase for a three-point amplitude. precisely one may isolate the boundary dependencies of a by
writing, for example, a = a  f dxq in the case of (p, q). apparently, a is an exact form universal to the
three phases, while f dxq depends on the boundary point q. using this separation, one may rewrite each phase
as

(x, x) = exp(cid:20)iez x
let us denote the rst factor exp(cid:2)ier x

(q, q) = 1, we conclude from eq. (56) that

x

(p, q)  (r, p )  (q, r) = exp(cid:20)

(57)

this is the nontrivial phase contribution one must attach to the amplitude of a three-point process when we write all
weak eld charged propagator according to eq. (48).

iii. applications

a.    

the weak-eld expansion derived in the last section has been applied to calculate the amplitudes of     and
its crossed processes in a homogeneous magnetic eld less than bc [4]. according to the discussion in the previous
section, the magnetic-eld dependencies of above amplitudes reside in two places: the rst place is in the electron
propagator which is aected by the external magnetic eld, while the second place is in the overall phase which is a
function of the eld strength tensor f . let us now take     as an example for illustration. since the incoming
photon energies are much less than mw , we can calculate the scattering amplitudes using the following eective
four-fermion interactions between leptons and neutrinos:

l = 

gf2

(l(1  5)l) (e(gv  ga5)e) ,

(58)

where gv = 1/2 + 2 sin2 w and ga = 1/2 for l = e; gv = 1/2 + 2 sin2 w and ga = 1/2 for l = ,  . the feynman
diagram contributing to     is shown in fig. 1 of ref. [4]. we should remark that the contribution due to ga
is proportional to the neutrino mass in the limit of vanishing magnetic eld. at o(eb) in the limit b  bc, it gives
no contribution to the amplitude by the charge conjugation invariance. therefore we shall neglect the contribution
by ga. likewise, we shall also neglect contributions by gv for l = ,  , since 1/2 + 2 sin2 w = 0.04  1.
to o(eb), the amplitude for     can be written as m  m1 + m2, where m1 arises from inserting the external
magnetic eld to electron propagators according to eq. (48), whereas m2 comes from expanding the overall phase
factor for the three-point function as shown in eq. (57). therefore one has

m1 = i4eb

#),

(59)

where gv = 1  (1  4 sin2 w)/2 for e and m is the mass of the electron. the rst and second term in gv are the
contributions from the w and z exchanges, respectively. to write down the amplitude m2, we recall eq. (57) which
states that the overall phase factor for     is

(x, y )  (z, x)  (y, z) = exp(cid:20)

ie
2

(z  x)f (x  y )(cid:21) .

with b in the forward z direction and choosing x = (0, 0, 0, 0), we arrive at

(x, y )  (z, x)  (y, z) = exp(cid:26)(ib

(y1z2  y2z1).

(61)

since we calculate the amplitude only to o(eb), the rst term of the above expansion gives rise to m1; while the
second term gives rise to m2 which reads:

before we proceed to compute m1 and m2, we wish to reiterate the validity of the above expansion. as we have
pointed out in ref. [4] that, by dimensional analysis, any given power of eb in the expansion of m is accompanied
by an equal power of 1/m2 (for m > p) or 1/p2 (for p > m). here p denotes the typical energy scale of external
particles. therefore, both eb/m2 and eb/p2 are much smaller than unity for b  bc  m2/e. now performing the
integration in m1 and m2, we obtain

m2 . our result is an extension of the calculation in ref. [3] which considers only the low energy limit
k1  k2  m2. in such a limit, one can calculate m using the eective lagrangian for     [9] and replacing one
of the photons by the external magnetic eld.

11

with the amplitude m , it is straightforward to compute the scattering cross section b(   ).

in the back-
ground magnetic eld since     could contribute to the energy-loss of a magnetized star, it is useful to compute
the stellar energy-loss rate q, which is related to b through [16]

(68)

in ref. [3], q is calculated based upon an approximated cross section obtained in the limit e  m. such a calculation
is repeated in our earlier work [4] which is based upon the cross section b(   ) obtained from the amplitude m
in eq. (64). we found that, for temperatures below 0.01 mev, the eective-lagrangian approach employed in ref.
[3]works very well. on the other hand, this approach becomes rather inaccurate for temperatures greater than 1 mev.
at t = 0.1 mev, our calculation gives an energy-loss rate almost two orders of magnitude greater than the result
from the eective lagrangian. such a behavior can be understood from the energy dependence of the scattering
cross section, as shown in fig. 2 of ref. [4]. it is clear that, for t = 0.1 mev, q must have received signicant
contributions from scatterings with   m. at this energy, the full calculation gives a much larger scattering cross
section than that given by the eective lagrangian. by comparing the predictions of the full calculation and the
eective-lagrangian approach [3], we conclude that the applicability of the latter to the energy-loss rate is quite
restricted. while the eective lagrangian works reasonably well with  < 0.1m , it would give a poor approximation
on q unless t < 0.01m.

b.    ,   

in order to compare our approach with previous ones, we consider the simple two-body decay modes     [1012]
and    [17] in a background magnetic eld. we shall limit the energies of incoming particles to be less than
the pair-production threshold 2m. for if e, e > 2m, the dominant decay modes should become   e+e and
  e+e respectively. for incoming energies below the pair-production threshold, it turns out that the photon
momenta in both     and    are space-like [18]. hence the former process is kinematically forbidden. the
amplitude of the latter process can be written as

m((p1)  (p2)(q)) = 

gf2e

z u(p2)(1  5)u(p1)(cid:0)gv  (q)  ga5

the factor z is the wave-function renormalization constant of the photon eld, induced by the eect of external
magnetic elds. since the deviation of z from the unity is rather small, proportional to the ne structure constant
, we shall set z = 1 in our subsequent discussions.

it should be noted that the validity of weak-eld expansion in eqs.(72) and (73) also depends on the ratio r

)2  1. for a suciently large photon energy such that r > 1, the
expansion in eqs. (72) and (73) may break down. however, since we have limited the photon energy to  < 2m, the
ratio r is automatically smaller than 1.

c , besides the requirement ( b
bc

the computation of    width requires the knowledge of photon index of refraction n  |~q|

 . the index of
refraction can be calculated from the two-point function (q). it is well known that n depends on the photon
polarizations. for the magnetic eld in the +z direction, the polarization states with distinct index of refraction are
 = (0, 0, 1, 0) and 

k = (0, cos , 0, sin ). here we have adopted the convention that q = (,  sin , 0,  cos ),
i.e., photon propagates on the x z plane with an angle  to the magnetic eld direction. hence ~ is the polarization
vector perpendicular to the x  z plane while ~k lies on the x  z plane. the photon dispersion relation is given by
(74)

q2  ia = 0,

where a = 
a  
and (74), we arrive at

a. here the index a stands for the polarization states, namely a =  or k. combining eqs. (72)

(cid:2)1 + ib sin2  + ic(cid:3) q2 = ib2 sin2 ,
[1 + ic] q2 = ia2 sin2 ,

(75)

for polarization states a =  and a =k respectively. since the electomagnetic coupling constant is rather small, the
left hand side of the above equations may be approximated by q2. using the denition q2 = 2  (1  n2), we obtain

n = 1 +

nk = 1 +

it is seen that the leading contributions to n and nk agree with the results obtained by adler [18]. the next-to-leading
contribution to n,k depend on both the photon energy  and the photon propagation direction [19].

given the above photon dispersion relation, we proceed to compute the    width in the sub-critical background
magnetic eld. we note that the most recent calculation of    width is performed by ioannisian and raelt [17].
following their approach, we write the width of this process as

 =

0

|m|2,

(77)

where m is the amplitude given by eq. (69), e1 is the neutrino energy, and max = min(e1, c) with c the critical
photon energy beyond which the photon four momentum becomes time-like and the cherenkov condition no longer
holds. we note that, in deriving the above width, one has taken the collinear approximation that the particles in the
initial and nal states are all parallel with one another. the correction to such an approximation is small, proportional
to the ne structure constant . from eq. (69), we obtain

where a =k,. the contribution by the vector-vector two-point function  is negligible since both p1 and p2 are
approximately parallel to the photon momentum q and q = 0 due to the gauge invariance. the fact that both
p1 and p2 are approximately parallel to q also has a consequence on the polarization dependencies of |m|2. this is
easily seen with

for a b eld in the +z direction, ( f q) is nonvanishing only for  = 0, 3. given 
k =
(0, cos , 0, sin ) as stated earlier, one immediately see that |m|2 vanishes for a photon in a  mode. hence the
photon radiated from the neutrino is polarized, with its polarization vector lying on the surface spanned by ~q and ~b.

since ck and c are already given by eq. (73),  can be easily determined once max is specied. since e1 < 2m,
which implies  < 2m, the photon refractive index is always greater than 1 as indicated by eq. (76). hence the critical
energy c for photon dispersion relation to cross the light cone is greater than 2m. thus max  min(e1, c) = e1.
the width  is given as follows:

comparisons of our result with the earlier results of ref. [12,17] are in order. first, we focus on the weak eld region
b < bc while refs. [12,17] considers the general magnetic eld and the corresponding coecient functions ck, are
expressed in double integrals. second, due to a dierent convention, the coecient functions obtained in ref. [17],

to compare the two sets of results, it is useful to realize that one can rotate the integration contour, s  is,
in this way, the phase eis0 turns into es0 and becomes

highly suppressed for a large s. for b < bc, such a behaviour permits one to simultaneously perform the
weak-eld and low-energy expansions with respect to ck,. the results of expanding |c

nized into the sum of the following series pn=0 an(2 sin2 /m2)n(b2/b2
c )n+1,
pn=0 cn(2 sin2 /m2)n(b2/b2
c )n+2 . one observes that the coecients a1 and a2 correspond to the o(2b2) and
o(4b4) terms in our |ck  c| respectively. we found that all the coecients a
is vanish. this is indeed reected

in our calculations where the o(2b2) and o(4b4) terms in |ck  c| vanish as well. we also found agreements
between the coecients b0,1 and the corresponding o(b2), o(2b4) terms in |ckc|. although we did not compare
the coecient c0 with the o(b4) term in ck, due to the growing complexity in computing the general coecients c
is,
the agreements we just found with respect to the rst two series seems rather compelling. due to these agreements,
we also conrm the statement made in ref. [17] that the earlier calculation on 5

 is incorrect.

from the above comparisons, we have seen that our approach, in spite of less general, is convenient for obtaining
the analytic amplitudes of physical processes in a sub-critical background magnetic eld. in such a magnetic eld, it
suces to know the leading and sub-leading terms in the weak-eld expansion. our approach produces those terms
directly from feynman diagrams.

the work on extending the present analysis to the more complicated processes, such as the photon splitting   
and the pair production   e+e is currently being pursued. for the latter process, we have exploited the analytical
properties of the vacuum polarization function  in the background magnetic eld. for a sub-critical magnetic
eld, it is possible to obtain a simple expression for the absorption coecient(the pair-production width) for arbitrary
photon energies [20]. this is an improvement to the previous work where a simplied expression is possible only for
  m [21]. for the former process,   , our result shall serve as an additional check to the previous results
[18,22].

iv. conclusion

in this paper, we have developed the weak-eld expansion technique for processes occurring in a background
magnetic eld. this expansion is performed with respect to internal electron propagators which are aected by the
background magnetic eld. in some processes, our approach is valid for general external momenta even if they are much
greater than the electron mass m. for external momenta much greater than m, the eective-lagrangian approach is
no longer appropriate. to illustrate this point, we calculated the amplitude of     under a background magnetic
eld, and consequently determined the stellar energy-loss rate q due to this process. it is interesting to nd that the
eective-lagrangian approach is inappropriate for computing the stellar energy-loss rate due to    , unless the
star temperature is less than 0.01 m. this result reects clearly the importance of our approach. in fact, our approach
can be applied to many other processes. in this regard, we also discussed the processes     and    under
a strong background magnetic eld. we found that the validity of weak-eld expansion with respect to the above
processes are also determined by the parameter r  2 sin2 b2/m2b2
c , besides the requirement b < bc. for energy
below pair production threshold, the parameter r is less than 1, which causes no trouble to the weak-eld expansion.
we found that     is kinematically forbidden while    is permitted by the phase space. our predictions
on the latter process agrees with previous works [17]. it has also been pointed out that our approach, although less
general, is convenient for obtaining the analytic amplitudes of physical processes in a sub-critical background magnetic
eld.

we are currently extending the weak-eld expansion technique to the photon splitting process    [18,22] and
the pair production process   e+e. [18,21]. both processes are of great interests in the physics of pulsars on which
the background magnetic elds are close to the critical value bc.
