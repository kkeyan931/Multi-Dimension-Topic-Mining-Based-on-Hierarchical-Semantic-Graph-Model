we derive several results concerning non-perturbative renormalization in the
spherical eld formalism. using a small set of local counterterms, we are able
to remove all ultraviolet divergences in a manner such that the renormalized
theory is nite and translationally invariant. as an explicit example we
consider massless 4 theory in four dimensions.

introduction

spherical eld theory is a non-perturbative method which uses the spheri-
cal partial wave expansion to reduce a general d-dimensional euclidean eld
theory into a set of coupled radial systems ([1], [2]). high spin partial waves
correspond with large tangential momenta and can be neglected if the theory
is properly renormalized. the remaining system can then be converted into
dierential equations and solved using standard numerical methods. 4 the-
ory in two dimensions was considered in [1]. in that case there was only one
divergent diagram, and it could be completely removed by normal ordering.
in general any super-renormalizable theory can be renormalized by removing
the divergent parts of divergent diagrams. using a high-spin cuto jmax and
discarding partial waves with spin greater than jmax, we simply compute the
relevant counterterms using spherical feynman rules.

the jmax cuto scheme however is not translationally invariant. it pre-
serves rotational invariance but regulates ultraviolet processes dierently de-
pending on radial distance. in the two-dimensional 4 example it was found
that the mass counterterm had the form

lc.t.  2(~t)hk0(t)i0(t) + 2pn=1,jmax

kn(t)in(t)i ,

where in, kn are nth-order modied bessel functions of the rst and second
kinds,  is the bare mass, and t is the magnitude of ~t. as jmax  , we nd

(1)

(2)

lc.t.  2(~t)hlog( 2jmax

t ) + o(j 1

max)i .

our regularization scheme varies with t, and we see that the counterterm also
depends on t. the physically relevant issue, however, is whether or not the
renormalized theory is independent of t. in this case the answer is yes. any
t dependence in renormalized amplitudes is suppressed by powers of j 1
max,
and translational invariance becomes exact as jmax  .

we now consider general renormalizable theories, in particular those which
are not super-renormalizable. in this case the number of divergent diagrams
is innite. since we are primarily interested in non-perturbative phenom-
ena, a diagram by diagram subtraction method is not useful. in the same
manner strictly perturbative methods such as dimensional regularization are
not relevant either. our interest is in non-perturbative renormalization,
where coecients of renormalization counterterms are determined by non-
perturbative computations.4
in this paper we analyze the general theory
of non-perturbative renormalization in the spherical eld formalism. in the
course of our analysis we answer the following three questions: (i) can ultra-
violet divergences be cancelled by a nite number of local counterterms? (ii)
can the renormalized theory be made translationally invariant? (iii) what
is the general form of the counterterms?

the organization of the paper is as follows. we begin with a discussion of
dierential renormalization, a regularization-independent method which will
allow us to construct local counterterms. next we describe a regularization
procedure which is convenient for spherical eld theory. in the large radius
limit t   our regularization procedure (which we call angle smearing) is

4we should mention that pauli-villars regularization is compatible with non-
perturbative renormalization. however this introduces additional unphysical degrees of
freedom and tends to be computationally inecient.

anisotropic but locally invariant under translations. for general t we expand
in powers of t1 to generate the general form of the counterterms. we con-
clude with two examples of one-loop divergent diagrams. we show by direct
calculation that the predicted counterterms render these processes nite and
translationally invariant.

2 dierential renormalization

dierential renormalization is the coordinate space version of the bphz
method.5
it is framed entirely in coordinate space, and renormalized am-
plitudes can be dened as distributions without reference to any specic
regularization procedure. dierential renormalization was introduced in [3],
and a systematic analysis of dierential renormalization to all orders in per-
turbation theory using bogoliubovs recursion formula was rst described
in [4]. the usual implementation of dierential renormalization is carried
out using singular poisson equations and their explicit solutions.
in our
discussion, however, we nd it more convenient to operate directly on the
distributions.6 we describe the details of our approach in the following. we
should stress that the two approaches are equivalent, diering only at the
level of formalism.

we assume that we are working with a renormalizable theory. for indices

i1,    ij let us dene

ti1,ij = ti1ti2    tij ,
i1,ij = i1i2    ij .

(3)
(4)

let f (~t) be a smooth test function, and let i(~t ~t; 2) be a smooth function
with support on a region of scale 1. we dene sj
~t [f ] (~t) as i(~t  ~t; 2)
multiplied by the jth order term in the taylor series of f (~t) about the point
~t. inserting delta functions, we have

contrast with [5], however, we do not a priori specify the nite parts of amplitudes.

for the purposes of this discussion we will require

i(~t  ~t; 2) = 1 + on (~t  ~t)

as ~t  ~t,

(6)

where n is some positive integer greater than the supercial degree of di-
vergence of any subdiagram7 in the theory we are considering.
for any
renormalizable theory n > 2 will suce. in our formalism, i(~t  ~t; 2) de-
termines how nite parts of renormalized amplitudes are assigned, and  is
the renormalization mass scale.

we now consider a particular diagram, g, with n vertices. we dene
k(~t1,   ~tn) to be the kernel of the amputated diagram, i.e., the value of the
diagram with vertices xed at points ~t1,   ~tn. the amplitude is obtained by
integrating k(~t1,   ~tn) with respect to all internal vertices. we will regard
k as a distribution acting on n smooth test functions f1,    fn. (for external
vertices containing more than one external line and/or derivatives, fext(~text)
should be regarded as a product of test functions, with possible derivatives,
at ~text.)

k : f1,    fn r d4~t1    d4~tn k(~t1,   ~tn)f1(~t1)    fn(~tn).

let us assume that our diagram is primitively divergent with supercial de-
gree of divergence j. we now dene another distribution tgk, which extracts
the divergent part of k. we start with the case when g has more than one
vertex. let us dene tgk : f1,    fn

the delta functions make this kernel completely local. we can read o the
corresponding counterterm interaction by functional dierentiation with re-
spect to each of the component functions of fext(~text) for the external vertices
and setting fint(~tint) = 1 for the internal vertices. we now turn to the case
when g has only one vertex. for this case we set tgk = k, which is equiva-
lent to normal ordering the interactions in our theory. in this case k is itself
local and therefore tgk and our counterterm interaction are again local.

we now extend the denition of tg in (10) to include the case of subdia-
grams. let g be a general 1pi diagram, and let g be a renormalization part8
of g with supercial degree of divergence j. for notational convenience we
will label the vertices of g so that the rst n vertices lie in g. if g has
only one vertex then again we normal order the interaction. otherwise we

it is straightforward to show that the t operation acts as the identity on
local interactions and thus treats overlapping divergences in the same manner
as bphz. following the standard bphz procedure ([6][8]), we can write

where f ranges over all forests10 of g, and  ranges over all renormalization
parts of f. in the product we have again ordered nested subdiagrams so that
larger diagrams are on the left. let j be the supercial degree of divergence
of g. the renormalized kernel, rk, is given by

rk = rk

rk = (1  tg) rk

for j < 0
for j  0.

(13)

our nal result is that all required counterterms are local, and the form of
the counterterms is

(14)

lc.t. =pa(,i) fa(~t)a((~t), i(~t)),

where the sum is over operators of renormalizable type. for the case of gauge
theories, our renormalization procedure is supplemented by the additional re-
quirement that the renormalized amplitudes satisfy ward identities.11 if our
regularization procedure breaks gauge invariance these identities are not au-
tomatic and the required local counterterms will in general be any operators
of renormalizable type (not merely gauge-invariant operators). this is, how-
ever, a separate discussion, and the details of implementing ward identity
constraints will be discussed in future work.

3 regularization by angle smearing

in this section we determine the functional form of the coecients fa(~t) in
(14). to make the discussion concrete, we will illustrate using the example
of massless 4 theory in four dimensions

let g(~t, ~t) be the free two-point correlator. we will use a regularization
scheme which preserves rotational invariance and is convenient for spherical

eld theory, but one which breaks translational invariance. we regulate
the short distance behavior of g by smearing the endpoints over a radius
t spherical shell within a conical region rm 2(~t), where rm 2(~t) is the set of
vectors ~u such that the angle between ~t and ~u is between  1
m t (see
figure 1). the result is a regulated correlator

we recall that our renormalized theory is determined by the translationally
invariant function i(~t  ~tave; 2) described in the previous section. even
though our regularization scheme breaks translational invariance, the renor-
malized theory nevertheless remains invariant.

in the limit t   the region becomes a at three-

we have chosen our coecients c(0)

ularization scheme is invariant under rotations about the origin, the radial
vector has a special orientation which is normal to our three-dimensional ball.
our regularization scheme is therefore not isotropic. the result (as should
be familiar from studies of anisotropic lattices) is that the coecient of the

from the long distance behavior of the integral in (9).12 with this we can

we now consider what occurs in the small region near the origin, t  1.
for the theory we are considering (and in fact for any renormalizable theory)
the highest ultraviolet divergence possible is quadratic.13 in the limit m 
 we deduce that each fa scales no greater than o(m 2). on the other hand
the volume of the region t  1 diminishes as o(m 4z4). thus the total
contribution from the region t  1 scales as o(m 4z2) and can be entirely
neglected.

4 spherical elds

we now examine the results of the previous section in the context of spherical
eld theory. we start with the spherical partial wave expansion,

where yl,m,n are four-dimensional spherical harmonics satisfying

 =pl=0,1,pn=0,lpm=n,nl,n,m(t)yl,n,m(, , ),
r d3 y 

l,n,m(, , )yl,n,m(, , ) = l,ln,nm,m,

l,n,m(, , ) = (1)myl,n,m(, , ).

the explicit form of yl,m,n can be found in [11].14 the integral of the free
massless lagrange density in terms of spherical elds is

(33)

it can be shown that the process of angle smearing the eld (~t) is equivalent
to multiplying l,n,m(t) by an extra factor sm

l (t) where

(34)

for large l, sm
l (t) diminishes as l2, and so the correlator receives an extra
suppression of l4. we will later use this result to estimate the contribu-
tion of high spin partial waves. the regularization of our correlator can be
implemented in our lagrange density by dividing factors of sm

we will devote the remainder of our discussion to computing one-loop spher-
ical feynman diagrams as a check of our results. our calculations are done
both numerically and analytically. the diagrams we will consider are shown
in figures 2 and 3. we start with the two-point function in figure 2. the
amplitude can be written as t3b(t) where

constants of proportionality are not important here and so we will dene
b(t) to be equal to the right side of (43). our results tell us that if we

in our plot t is measured in units of p1 and m = 3p. from (42) the
expected error is of size m 8t8
. we see that the data is consistent with the
results expected. again the deviation for t . m 1 integrates to a negligible
contribution as m  .

6 summary

we have examined several important features of non-perturbative renormal-
ization in the spherical eld formalism and answered the three questions
posed in the introduction. ultraviolet divergences can be cancelled by a -
nite number of local counterterms in a manner such that the renormalized
theory is translationally invariant. using angle-smearing regularization we
nd that the counterterms for 4 theory in four dimensions can be parame-
terized by ve unknown constants as shown in (29). aside from our remarks
about ward identity constraints in gauge theories, the extension to other
eld theories is straightforward. we hope that these results will be useful for
future studies of general renormalizable theories by spherical eld techniques.
