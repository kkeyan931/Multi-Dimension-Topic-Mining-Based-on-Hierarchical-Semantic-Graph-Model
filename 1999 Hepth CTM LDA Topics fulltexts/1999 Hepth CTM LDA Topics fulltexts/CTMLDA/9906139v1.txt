1. introduction

a physicists motivation for studying fractional level wzw models is that by drinfeld

sokolov reduction one can obtain a huge class of w -algebra models.

much of the simplicity of integrable wzw models rests in the fact that all the relevant

representations can be induced from nite dimensional representations of the horizontal

lie algebra  conversely, all correlation functions can be reduced by the ward identities

to correlation functions of elds transforming in nite dimensional representations of the

horizontal subalgebra. finite dimensional representations can be described in terms of

polynomials on the ag manifold, and so correlation functions of elds in integrable models

also have polynomial dependence on the ag manifold coordinates.

in fractional level

wzw models where the representations are characterised by non integral weights [2],

the correlation functions of any elds can again be reduced to functions of ag manifold

variables, but these correlation functions can have singularities not only in the chiral

(space-time) variable but also singularities on nontrivial submanifolds of the ag manifold.

the case of sl(2) has been much studied and worked out in some detail. an example

are the correlation functions of fractional level bsl(2) found in [3], [4]: the 4point blocks are

functions of the ag manifold (isospin) coordinate x given by certain multiple contour

integrals and it was shown that there exists a choice of the contours, depending nontrivially

on x, such that the asymptotic behaviour of the 4-point blocks reproduces the fusion rules

found by awata and yamada (ay) [5]. a dierent fusion rule was proposed somewhat

earlier by bernard and felder (bf) [6], and conrmed by examples of 4point correlators

[7]. the bf rule, however, looks rather degenerate and leads to nilpotent fusion matrices.

a more abstract analysis of the number of independent 3-point couplings determining

the fusion rules was carried out in [8] and [9], who conrmed the fusions rules of ay

and bf respectively, the set of couplings allowed by the bf fusion rule being a subset of

those allowed by the ay rules. in section 3 we explain clearly the relation between the

calculations of [8] and [9].

the situation for higher rank cases is much more complicated, even on the level of

3point invariants. the decoupling of the verma module singular vectors is central in any

of the methods used to derive the fusion rules. the main obstacle comes from the fact

that the expressions [10] for the singular vectors in verma modules of non integral highest

weights are too complicated to be analysed as systematically as can be done in the simplest

sl(2) case, or as can be done for the general integrable representations where (apart from

2

a simple additional ane vector) the problem reduces to that of the nite dimensional

representations of the horizontal subalgebra.

despite these diculties, the fusion rules for the admissible bsl(3)k representations at

level  = k + 3 = 3/p were found in [1] using only partial information about the solutions

of the decoupling equations. these rules, which can be easily extended to the general
admissible level values  = p/p, are expected to be the sl(3) analogue of the generic sl(2)

ay fusion rules.

moreover, just as the fusion rules at integral k are a truncation of the ring of tensor

products of nite dimensional representations of g, so the fusion rules at a rational level

 = 3/p are truncations of the fusion ring of a nonrational cft ( 6 q); similarly, the

singular vector decoupling equations for the representations arising in this nonrational

cft are a subset of those in the rational cft. the fusion ring of this irrational cft was

described in [1] where it was explicitly realised by a novel extension of the ring of formal

characters of nite dimensional representations of sl(3). it is generated by a simple current
 , 3 = 1 and three fundamental representations f , f  and h, satisfying one relation.
these representations have (horizontal) weights f = 1, f  = 2 and h = w121 
(( 1 + 2)) respectively, where 1 , 2 are the sl(3) fundamental weights. the fusion of
the elds f and f  with a generic eld is a sum of seven terms, each with multiplicity one,

and in this way they are analogues of the sl(3) fundamental representations; the fusion of h

however has three terms of multiplicity one and one of multiplicity two. in [1], the singular

vector decoupling equations were used to examine the space of three point couplings, and

the (generically) 7-terms fusion of f was found, leading also to explicit solutions for the 3

point invariants. however, for elds which admitted fusions with non-trivial multiplicities,

the number of three-point couplings with a generic eld found in [1] was less than that

predicted by the fusion ring.

in this paper we reconsider this problem and analyse the decoupling conditions for

the simplest nontrivial multiplicity examples by two dierent methods. in section 2 we use

(as in [1]) the standard method of representing the generators and the singular vectors in

terms of dierential operators with respect to the ag variable coordinates x. whereas in

[1] an explicit ansatz was used for the three-point coupling, here we consider an arbitrary

function of x; we nd that for the representation h the null-vector decoupling conditions

reduce to two hypergeometric equations. for the multiplicity two state we get two solutions

spanned by appropriate 2f1 hypergeometric functions. similar analysis applied to a more

3

complicated example involving 4-order dierential equations also conrms the fusion rule

multiplicities of [1].

the second method we exploit in section 3 is purely algebraic, extending a method
of feigin and fuchs [11] for the virasoro algebra, and of malikov and feigin [8] for sl(2).
it is based on the fact that, while the elds (x) transform under a dierential operator

realisation of g = sl(3) which is neither highest nor lowest weight representation, these

elds can be also interpreted as highest weight states with respect to a choice of the
borel subalgebra b(x) depending on the coordinates x of the ag manifold. the idea is
to consider the space of states generated by the rst eld in a 3point function and to

use the fact that the two other elds are highest/lowest weight states after an appropriate

rotation of the borel subalgebra. thus this space of states is eectively factored by an ideal

depending on x and the truncation is so severe that we are left with a nite dimensional

space describing the possible fusion rules. in section 3 we start rst with the simpler case

of sl(2) where we discuss the relation between the fusion rules in [5] and those in [6]. in

the sl(3) case, the algebraic approach is applied to the couplings of the representation h

for generic values of the coordinate x. the two approaches to the decoupling problem are

in full agreement and conrm the fusion rule of [1].

1.1. fields and generators

in this paper we shall deal with representations of g = bsl(3)k labelled by non-integral

weights. when (as is typically the case) the horizontal projection of the non-integral

weight is also non-integral, the associated eld does not transform in a nite dimensional

representation of the horizontal subalgebra g.

the innite dimensional representations which arise this way are described classically

by induced representations of sl(3) on functions f : sl(3) 7 c satisfying the condition
f (gy h) = (h)f (g), where (h) is a character of the cartan subgroup and y is the
subgroup of upper triangular matrices with units on the diagonal. the representation is
given by the left multiplication of sl(3) on the space of functions, (t (g)f )(g) = f (g1g).

equivalently these representations are realised in terms of functions on the homoge-

neous g/(y h) space obtained by dividing by the borel subgroup y h. this space is the
ag manifold ww w xw, where w is the weyl group with elements w represented by ma-
trices w  sl(3). the generic 3-dimensional big cell x = x1 consists of lower triangular

matrices with units on the diagonal; we shall denote them x(x, y, z), or, simply x, where

(x, y, z) are coordinates corresponding to the matrix entries 21, 32 and 31 respectively (see,

4

e.g., [12], or, for a broader discussion, [13]). the remaining cells w xw, with xw given by
lower triangular matrices with some zeros, account for the innities encountered in the

(local) gauss decomposition of the elements of sl(3) and are thus needed to give meaning

to the global left action of the group. hence these remaining cells can also be thought of

as the result of taking some of the coordinates in x to innity in certain prescribed ways.

in particular, w = wx(0, 0, 0) is the only point of the cell of lowest dimension of the ag
manifold where w is the matrix realising the action of the longest weyl group element
w121 = w, coinciding in the sl(3) case with the reection with respect to the highest root
 = 1+2.

the right action of the group, (t r(g)f )(g) = f (g g), or rather its innitesimal ver-

sion, has a dierent meaning: because of the above invariance with respect to y h, any of

the functions f can be identied with a highest weight state of a highest weight represen-

tation built by the generators of (right) translations.

following the classical analogy, the operator valued quantum elds (chiral vertex

operators) depend on a pair of variables, (x)  (x, u), where u is the usual space-
time chiral coordinate. the complex number u can be similarly interpreted as a coordinate

on the big cell of the ag manifold of sl(2), the action of the non-trivial weyl group

element r is given by r(u) = 1/u, and the point at innity on the riemann sphere is the

only point r(0) on r xr.

the commutation relations of the generators tn of g with these elds are

[(x, u) , tn] = un d()(t ) (x, u)

(1.1)

where t  t0  g and d()(t ) are dierential operators (the innitesimal version of the
above left action of the group). in our convention these are

d(f 1) = x, d(f 2) = (y + xz), d(f 3) = z ,

d(h1) = 2xx  r1  yy + zz ,

d(h2) = 2yy  r2  xx + zz ,

d(e1) = (x)2x  r1x + (z  xy)y + xzz ,
d(e2) = (y)2y  r2y  zx ,
d(e3) = (z)2z  r2(z  xy)  r1z + xzx + y(z  xy)y ,

(1.2)

where for simplicity we have omitted the index . here ri = h , ii = (hi) are the com-
ponents of the weight . this is a representation of g with k = 0.

5

one can dene states |i = limx,y,z ,u0  (x, u)|0i, which satisfy the usual conditions

of a highest weight state

ei|i = 0 ,

hi|i = d()(hi)|i = (hi) |i , tn |i = 0 , n > 0 ,

(1.3)

where furthermore |i is assumed to be an eigenstate of the central charge operator with

eigenvalue k; we shall omit the explicit dependence on k of this highest weight state.
analogously, the dual state h| satisfying h|i =  and

h|f i = 0 ,

h|hi = (hi)h| ,

h|tn = 0 , n > 0 .

can be reproduced, with a proper normalisation of the elds, as

h| = lim

x,y,z ,u0

h0|  ( wx(x, y, z), r(u) )

where  is the sugawara conformal weight and  = w(). note that this way the
limits of the chiral coordinate u and the ag coordinate x are treated on the same footing.

eqn. (1.4) follows from (1.5) using

(cid:2) ( wx, r(u) ) , tn (cid:3) = (u)n d()( w(t )) ( wx, r(u) ) ,

where w(t ) is the adjoint action of w on t .

in section 4 we discuss a purely algebraic treatment of correlation functions which

relies on the use of a set of generators which can be seen as the analogue of the right
action generators discussed above. namely we dene tn  tn(x) by

tn = u (x) tn u (x)1 ,

(1.6)

where u (x) = exp(xf 1 + yf 2 + (z  xy

2 ) f 3) is the operator implementing the translations

u (x ) (x) u (x )1 = (x x) .

(the corresponding innitesimal generators appear in the rst line of (1.2).) more explic-

itly (1.6) read

f 1 = f 1 + yf 3 ,

f 2 = f 2  xf 3 ,

f 3 = f 3 ,

h1 = h1 + 2xf 1  yf 2 + (z+xy)f 3 ,

h2 = h2 + 2xf 2  yf 1 + (z2xy)f 3 ,

e1 = e1  xh1  x2f 1 + zf 2  xzf 3 ,

(1.7)

e2 = e2  yh2  y2f 2  (zxy)f 1  y(zxy)f 3 ,

e3 = e3  (zxy)h1  zh2  ye1 + xe2  x(zxy)f 1  yzf 2  z(z  xy)f 3 .

if the generators in the r.h.s. of (1.7) are replaced by their dierential operators

counterparts in (1.2) then they reduce (up to a sign) to the classical generators of the
right action of the group, i.e. f i turn into the generators of right translations, ei vanish
identically while hi reduce to the numerical values (hi). thus (1.6) can be also looked
on as a change of basis in the algebra which partially diagonalises the left action of g.

(such an algebra g(x) attached to a point x of the ag manifold has been discussed in

the sl(2) case in [8].) explicitly, choosing u = 1

n] = (hi) (x) ,

[(x) , hi
[(x) , ej

n] = 0 .

(1.8)

1.2. correlation functions and singular vectors

one can now address the problem of nding npoint functions invariant with respect

to the action of g in (1.1), (1.2). while the full 3point correlators

h0|   (x3, u3) (x2, u2) (x1, u1) |0i ,

are indeed invariant w.r.t. g, it is simpler to deal with the correlator with xed rst and

third coordinates

c

 (x) = h|(x)|i ,

(1.9)

which are only restricted by the counterpart of the ward identity with respect to the

cartan generators,

(cid:16)(hi)  (hi)  d()(hi)(cid:17)c

 (x) = 0 ,

i = 1, 2 .

(1.10)

similarly the ward identity with respect to the scale generator l0 xes the dependence
on u (suppressed in (1.9)) to a power given by     .

the requirement that singular vectors in the verma module of highest weight  de-

couple from correlation functions imposes additional restrictions on (1.9), thus selecting

a subset of the possible 3point invariants. the dimension of the total (linear) space of
solutions gives the multiplicity n 
 of the representation  occurring in the fusion   .
there is a singular vector (denoted by s|i) in the verma module with highest
+ = +  ( + z>0 ) satisfying

weight  whenever there is a real positive root   re

the kac-kazhdan reducibility condition

h +  + 0 , i  z>0 .

(1.11)

7

here  = 0 + 1 + 2; j , j=0, 1, 2 , are the three simple roots of g;  = 1+ 2 is the
weyl vector of g;  = k + 3 is the shifted value of the central charge; and 0 is the
fundamental weight of g dual to the ane root 0 satisfying h0, ji = j0. (for details
see, e.g., [14]). s|i is a highest weight vector with weight w   given by the shifted
action of the kac-kazhdan reection w in the ane weyl group w on .

the element s is of a xed grade n < 0 in the universal envelope of g (g =
g  g0  g+ being the triangular decomposition of g). using this fact, eqns. (1.1) and
(1.4), commuting s through the eld we nd

h| (x, u) s |i = un d()( s ) h| (x, u) |i ,

(1.12)

where s is the projection of s to the horizontal subalgebra. imposing the vanishing of
the matrix elements of s|i leads to the dierential equation

d()( s ) c

 (x) = 0 .

(1.13)

we turn to the solutions of these equations in section 2.

1.3. the model

we now turn to our problem in which we shall essentially deal with a non-rational

counterpart of the admissible cft [2].

we shall call pre-admissible the innite set p+ of highest weights dened for generic

(k 6 q) values of the central charge considered in [1],

p+ = {  wt  ( + k0) | w  w , ,   p+ , h, ii + w(i)  re
+ ,

i = 1, 2} .

(1.14)
here tp is the group of translations in the weight lattice p = i z i of the horizontal
subalgebra g. for such weights the kac-kazhdan roots i, i=1, 2 are explicitly

i = h, ii + w(i) ,

(1.15)

and the reducibility pattern of the g verma modules with highest weights in this set

parallels that of the verma modules of g of dominant integral highest weights; in particular,

the maximal submodule of any such g verma module is a union of the verma submodules
generated by the two singular vectors si|i with i as in (1.15). in what follows we shall
mostly use the horizontal projections  = w  (  ) of the weights  .

8

if in (1.14) we take w = 1 ,  = 0, we recover the weights of a non-rational cft (which

might be called pre-integrable) for which the fusion rules are given by the standard sl(3)
tensor product rules for .

here (as in [1]) we shall mostly concentrate on the other generic subset of (1.14) ob-
tained by taking  = 0. the set of such weights can be looked on as the set of integral
dominant weights of the weight lattice w = w tp  the extended ane weyl group of
g. each of these weights has associated to it a generalised weight diagram parametrised by

a nite subset of the ane weyl group w = w tq (where q is the root lattice of g), and a

generalised formal character  . the characters close under multiplication and the struc-

ture constants of the resulting (commutative) ring serve as the fusion rule multiplicities

of the corresponding non-rational cft. the ring is an extension of the ring of charac-

ters of nite dimensional representations of sl(3). it is generated by three fundamental

characters and a simple current character with highest weights given by

f = 1 ,

f  = 2 ,

h = w0  (k0) = w121 () = (2) ,

 = w12 (2) ,
(1.16)

and which satisfy

3

 = 1 ,

h h = 2 h + 1 +  f + 

2 f  .

(1.17)

the singular vectors in the verma modules of highest weights (1.16) are determined by

the corresponding kac-kazhdan reections wi , i = 1, 2 and can be recovered from the
general formulae of [10]. for the simple current  these are especially simple (1 , 2) =
(2 ,   1  2), i.e. the two singular vectors are given by monomials of f 2 and e3
1,
and the rules for the fusion of  with an arbitrary weight  are correspondingly simple:
   = w12  (2 + ). the fusion rules and the generalised formal characters of the
remaining representations in (1.16) are described in [1]. in particular the representation

denoted h provides the simplest example of a nontrivial multiplicity and its fusion with a

generic  reads

h   = 2  w121  ( + )  w1  ()  w2  () .

(1.18)

in the next section we shall recover this generic fusion rule from the decoupling of the

singular vectors in the verma module of highest weight h = (  2).

9

2. dierential equation approach

we start by recalling the result in [1] for the rst two of the fundamental represen-

tations in (1.16). in [1] the decoupling equations corresponding to the real positive roots

i , i = 1, 2 were investigated using the ansatz

xa(z  xy)cybzd .

(2.1)

we recall that the solution of (1.13) in the integrable case is given by such monomials with

nonnegative integer powers a, b, c, d restricted by 0  a + c  h, 1i , 0  b + d  h, 2i ,
a basis being selected, e.g., by the subset {(a, 0, c, d)}  {(0, b, c, d), b 6= 0} (see e.g.,[12]).

choosing  (or ) to be the identity representation, these monomials and the corresponding

values of  =   a1  b2  (c + d)(1 + 2) (or ) are in one to one correspondence
with the weight diagram of the nite dimensional representation of highest weight  (or 

respectively) and the number of dierent monomials producing a given value of  coincides

with the multiplicity of this weight in the weight diagram.

the solutions found in [1] involved monomials (2.1) with nonintegral powers. however

it is not necessary to assume such an ansatz which is too restrictive in general and we

present here an alternative derivation.

since the ratio  = z/(xy) is invariant with respect to the global sl(3) scale trans-

formations (x, y, z)  (1x , 2y , 12z), (i.e. it is annihilated by the cartan generators
d()(hi) in (1.2) for ri = (hi) = 0) the general solution to the cartan subalgebra ward
identities (1.10) is

c(x, y, z) = xayb f(cid:0) z

xy(cid:1) ,

(2.2)

where f () is an arbitrary function and a and b are determined by (1.10):

h +   a1  b2   , ii = 0 ,

i = 1, 2 .

(2.3)

when  is one of the analogues of the symmetric representations  = l 1 or  = l 2
one of the dierential operators is very simple  d(f 2) or d(f 1). this restricts f () to a
monomial f () = (1)b or f () = ()a, respectively, and hence the solutions are indeed

monomials of the form (2.1). it then remains to use the equation corresponding to the

other singular vector to determine the possible values of  as a function of  , .

this has been done in [1] for l = 1 and l = 2. for the representation f given by (1.16)

there turn out to be 7 solutions for   p+ in (1.10), i.e. 7 terms in the fusion f   for

10

generic values of   p+ . for completeness we write down here the zero mode projection
of the nontrivial singular vector for l = 1, i.e. for the rst example in (1.16)

s1 = (f 1)1+ (e3)2 f 2 (e3)1 (f 1)1

= (cid:0)e3 f 1 + (1+) e2(cid:1)(cid:0)f 2 f 1 f 3(cid:1) + (1)(cid:0)e1 f 1  (1+) h1   (1+)(cid:1) f 1 .

we turn now to the third fundamental weight h in (1.16), for which the two singular

vectors correspond to the roots i = 0 + i , i = 1, 2 . their horizontal projections are

s1 = e3 f 1 + (2) e2 ,
s2 = e3 f 2  (2) e1 .

(2.4)

inserting the dierential operator representation (1.2) one obtains two second order dier-

ential equations for the unknown function f in (2.2)

d2

d 2  (cid:16)(1+a+br2) + (2ab+r1+r2)(cid:17) d
h  2(1)
+(cid:16)(2a)(r2b)  a(1+a+br2r1)(cid:17) if () = 0 ,
h (1)2 d2
(cid:16)b(1+br2)+(ar1)(2)  b(1+a+br2r1)(cid:17) if () = 0 .

d 2  (cid:16)b1r2+(1a3b+r1+2r2+) +  2(a+2br1r2)(cid:17) d

d

(2.5)

d

for generic values of a, b the two equations in (2.5) are dierent and their order can be

reduced exploiting euclids algorithm  for generic values of  the second order terms can

be eliminated between the two equations giving a rst order equation; dierentiating this

equation again we can then eliminate the second order term from one of the two original

equations  this whole process yielding two rst order dierential equations. for generic

values of  the resulting system of two rst order equations is consistent for three particular
values of the pair of parameters, (a, b) = (r1 + r2, r1 + r2) , (r1 +   1,   2) , (  2, r2 +
  1), and accordingly one obtains three monomial solutions f () = (  1)c d with
(c, d) = (r2, r1) , (0,   2  r2) , (  2  r1, r1), respectively.
inserting the values of
(a, b) in (2.3) we obtain for a given generic  three values of  which precisely recover

the remaining multiplicity 1 weights in the fusion h   as predicted in [1].

however, for a = b = 2 the two equations (2.5) become identical, and the resulting
equation is a hypergeometric equation. for such a, b and r2 6= 2 the solution of (2.5)
is a linear combination of two hypergeometric functions

f1() = 2f1(2   , 3 + r1 + r2  ; 3 + r2  ; ) ,

f2() = ()2r2

2f1(r2 , 1 + r1;   1  r2; ) .

(2.6)

11

for r2 = 2 these hypergeometric series formally coincide so one of the solutions is instead
logarithmic,

f1() = 2f1(2   , 1 + r1; 1; ) ,

f2() = ln() 2f1(2   , 1 + r1; 1; ) + . . .

(2.7)

to nd the representation  to which this fusion corresponds we insert a = b =   2

in (2.3) to nd  = , i.e. the weight  appears twice in the fusion h  . this is the

missing multiplicity two solution predicted in [1] which is now seen to correspond to a

novel hypergeometric function expression of the matrix element c(x) (2.2).

in fact a

multiplicity 2 was noticed in the previous calculations but only for the particular choice

 = 0. we can reconcile this with the treatment here by noticing that for r1 = 0 the rst
hypergeometric series in (2.6) simplies to a geometric series, i.e, f1() = (1  )2 =
(xy)2 (xy  z)2, and similarly for r1 = r2 = 0 the second solution in (2.6) becomes
f2() =  2 = (xy)2 z2, i.e. both solutions degenerate to monomial solutions of the
type discussed above.

as another example we have checked by mathematica the case with  = , the

analogue of the adjoint representation of sl(3). it involves a system of two fourth order

linear dierential equations for the function f () and reveals a relation between the or-

der of the equation and the multiplicity of the corresponding value of  similar to the

one encountered in the above simpler example. namely for the particular values of the
parameters a = b =  the initial system degenerates to one fourth order dierential

equation possessing 4 linearly independent solutions and thus leading to a multiplicity 4
of the weight  = ; if  6=  these two fourth-order equations can be reduced to two third

order equations but there are three dierent sets of values of a and b for which these

third order equations become identical, leading to three solutions of multiplicity three; at

the next step there are 9 possibilities of degeneration to one second order equation (again

a hypergeometric equation) leading to multiplicity 2 solutions, and nally there are 12

monomial solutions of rst order equations corresponding to multiplicity 1 values of .

the nal result is in perfect agreement with the prediction in [1].

one can expect that a similar mechanism holds in general. in particular the maximal
order of the dierential operator corresponding to a singular vector si (with i as in
(1.15)) can be computed from the expression in [10] to be h3 + w() , ii. the minimal
of these two numbers coincides precisely with the maximal multiplicity in the generalised
weight diagram associated to  = w  (). as discussed in [1], this multiplicity is
also the maximal multiplicity in the standard weight diagram of the nite dimensional
representation of sl(3) of highest weight 3 + w()  .

3. quotient space method

in this section we shall treat the decoupling problem and the appearance of nite

dimensional solution spaces in an alternative way. this method is purely algebraic, and

rst appeared in conformal eld theory in [11] where feigin and fuchs used it to study the

fusion in virasoro minimal models. since then it has been applied to other models [15],

and developed extensively in one direction by zhu [16], but we shall stick to the spirit of

[11].

to explain how this method works we shall rst reconsider the case of sl(2) because

sl(2) has fewer generators than sl(3), and hence the expressions are simpler. this case

has already been treated by feigin and malikov [8] and by dong et al [9], with apparently

contradictory results, and we think it will be helpful to explain how the various dierent

results t together (n.b. the bsl(2) calculations here are essentially all contained in [8] and

[9].)

the algebraic method relies on the observation that the inner product of a highest

weight state, a primary eld corresponding to the vertex operator of a highest weight state,

and an arbitrary state in a highest weight representation, satises various identities.

to express these identities, we need some notation. the generators of bsl(2) are denoted

by em, fm and hm and have commutation relations

(cid:2) hm , hn (cid:3) = 2 k m m+n ,
(cid:2) hm , en (cid:3) = 2 em+n ,
(cid:2) hm , fn (cid:3) = 2 fm+n ,
(cid:2) em , fn (cid:3) =

k m m+n + hm+n .

(3.1)

we denote highest weight verma modules with highest weight |ri by mr and the corre-
sponding irreducible module by lr, where the states |ri and hr| satisfy

fm |ri = 0 , m > 0 ,

em |ri = 0 , m  0 ,

hm |ri = r m0 |ri , m  0 ,

hr| em = 0 , m < 0 ,

hr| fm = 0 , m  0 ,

hr| hm = r m0 hr| , m  0 .

(3.2)

we are interested in working out the number of independent couplings of the form

h| (z) |i ,

13

(3.3)

where |i is some general state in a highest-weight representation of bsl(2); h| is anni-

hilated by all tm, m < 0 (and hence is in some representation of the horizontal sl(2)
subalgebra generated by t  t0). finally, the elds (z) transform as

(cid:2) (z) , tm (cid:3) = zm d(t ) (z) ,

where d(t ) is some representation of sl(2). a consequence of this denition is that

(cid:2) tm  z tm1 , (z) (cid:3) = 0 ,

so that for any generator t

h| (z) (tm  zm1t1) = 0 , m  2

consequently (taking z = 1) for any state |i, the state

(tm  t1) |i ,

m  2 ,

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

has zero inner product with h| (1). this means that to nd the space of independent

couplings from an irreducible highest weight representation lr of bsl(2) to states of the

form h| (z) one need only consider the quotient space

a(lr) = lr(cid:14) < (tm  t1) lr > .

(3.7)

zhus algebra a(l0) is exactly the space dened in equation (3.7). he showed that the
space a(l0) can itself be given an algebra structure, and that the space of irreducible rep-

resentations of the vertex algebra l0 are in one-to-one correspondence with the irreducible
representations of the algebra a(l0). the main problem with trying to follow zhus anal-

ysis for admissible but non-integrable representations of bsl(2) is that typically a(lr) is

innite-dimensional for any r, and the analysis of this space correspondingly harder than

for the integrable case (although it may be carried through  see e.g. [17])

however, in the spirit of [11], it is not necessary to consider the full space a(lr) to

nd the allowed fusions with lr. for the integrable case k one can use the ward identities

to express the general three-point function

h| (z) |i ,

14

(3.3)

in terms of some three point function

hr| r (x; z) |i ,

(3.8)

where hr| is a highest weight state of g and r (x; z) is a highest weight state for some
borel subalgebra b(x) of g parametrised by the coordinate x on the ag manifold.

for the integrable case the choice of x is not important for the reason that r (x; z)
can be expanded as a polynomial in x. the leading coecient r (0; z) then turns out to
be a highest weight for b  b(0) and the space of couplings turns out to be independent

of x.

however, for an innite-dimensional representation of sl(2), assuming that r (x; z)
can be expanded as an integer power series in x requires that r (0; z) is a highest weight
for b(0) and leads exactly to the restricted fusion rules found by bf. to nd the full set

of fusion rules one must accept that one cannot necessarily expand r (x; z) about x = 0
or x =  and one must take (3.8) as a starting point. we shall see that dierent (non-
generic) choices of the borel subalgebra b(x) of g used to dene r (x; z) may lead for
nonintegral r to dierent (degenerate) results for the space of fusions.

given our standard splitting into em, fm and hm, as for sl(3), with b the standard
borel subalgebra of sl(2) generated by e0 and h0, we can require elds to be highest weight
states for any conjugate subalgebra

b = u b u 1 ,

(3.9)

of our standard raising operators by some constant group element u .

if we consider

conjugation by

for which

u = exp( xf0 ) ,

em = exp( xf0 ) em exp( xf0 ) = em  xhm  x2fm ,
hm = exp( xf0 ) hm exp( xf0 ) = hm + 2xfm ,

then the elds r (x; z) being highest weight states for these generators implies

(cid:2) em  xhm  x2fm , r (x; z) (cid:3) = 0 ,

(cid:2) hm + 2xfm , r (x; z) (cid:3) = zm r r (x; z) .

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

if we allow x to take all values including x =  (which, suitably interpreted, corresponds to

u = w, the weyl group element of sl(2)) then this covers all highest weight elds. one can

15

of course nd a representation of em, hm, fm on the elds r (x; z) in terms of dierential
operators, in a manner analogous to that for sl(3), such that the relations (3.5) and

(3.12) hold; however it is not necessary to consider the dierential operator representation

explicitly since (3.5) and (3.12) are the only relations needed in the algebraic treatment.

so, given these relations, we nd that

hr| r (x; 1) (tm  t1) = 0 , m > 1 ,
hr| r (x; 1) (e1  xh1  x2f1) = 0 ,

hr| r (x; 1) (f0  f1) = 0 ,

hr| r (x; 1) (h0  h1) = r hr| r (x; 1) ,

hr| r (x; 1) (h1 + 2xf1) = r hr| r (x; 1) .

(3.13)

consequently we dene the new quotient space

a<

x (lr) = lr(cid:14) jx lr ,

(3.14)

where jx is the linear span of the elements of g

tm  t1 , m < 1 ,

e1  xh1  x2f1 ,

and f0  f1 .

(3.15)

the space a<

x (lr) then carries an action of u (1)  u (1) with generators

h() = h0  h1 ,

and h = (h1 + 2xf1) ,

(3.16)

which take values r and r on hr| r (x; 1), respectively. 1 the space of allowed fusions
to the representation lr is now the space a<
x (lr) viewed as a c[h(), h] module  that is
(h(), h) are restricted to lie on some curves and points in the (h(), h) plane, possibly
with multiplicities. although h() and h may not be strictly diagonalisable, we shall
often refer to their allowed values as their spectrum; in the case of lr admissible it
turns out that h() and h are genuinely diagonalisable, with a<
x (lr) being a direct sum
of eigenspaces of h() and h. the dimension of the factor-space of xed eigenvalues
a<

x (lr)(r,r) describes the fusion rule multiplicities,

dim a<

x (lr)(r,r) = n r

rr .

(3.17)

1 the generators h() and h which commute up to an element in jx are analogues of the
linear combinations of virasoro generators in [11], l0 2zl1+z2l2 and l1 zl2 respectively,
while the combinations (3.15) are analogues of ln  2zln1 + z2ln2 , n > 0.

16

a natural spanning set for lr/jxlr are the states

(h1)m (f0)n |ri .

(3.18)

if x is generic, i.e. x 6= 0, , then we have

h1 = h0  h() ,

f0 = (f0  f1) +

1
2x

(h  h()  h0) .

(3.19)

and so an equally good spanning set for a<

x (lr) is

(h())m (h)n |ri .

(3.20)

however this is not a good choice if x = 0 (unless r = 0) or x =  (unless r = k). if x = 0,
then we have e1 = e1, and more importantly, h1 = h and h()h = h0, so that
h() and h are simultaneously diagonalised on the weight spaces, and we can take as a
spanning set of a<

0 (lr)

(h)m (f0)n |ri .

(3.21)

if, conversely, x = , then we nd f0 should be included in j , that h1 = h,
h() + h = h0, so that h() and h are again diagonalised on the weight spaces, but
that e1 in unconstrained, so that we can take as a spanning set of a<

0 (lr)

(h)m (e1)n |ri .

(3.22)

if mr is irreducible then in each case the states (3.20), (3.21) and (3.22) are linearly
independent, but if mr contains null vectors, there will be linear relations among these
states. if x is generic, a<
x (lr) naturally takes the form of a simple quotient of the polyno-
mial ring c[ h() , h ], since singular vectors in the verma module mr lead to polynomial
constraints in a<
0 (lr) and
a<

x (mr). however in the other two cases the structures of a<

(lr) may be more complicated.

physically, taking x = 0 or x =  puts strong constraints on the allowed fusions. for

representations for which r, r or r are not non-negative integers,

hr| r (x; z) |ri ,

may have singular expansions around x = 0 and x = . one would hope that the algebraic

method would only nd the fusions for which the three point functions are regular, that
the dimension of a<
x (lr),

(lr) would be smaller than the generic result a<

0 (lr) and a<

17

excluding precisely those fusions for which the three-point function does not have a power-

series expansion at x = 0 and x =  respectively. this is exactly what has been found.

feigin and malikov calculated a<

x (lr) for the generic values x = 1 and found the nice
fusion rules of awata & yamada [5]; the fusion rules were also investigated in [9] through
the construction of a space a(l)  which is nothing but a<

x (lr) with x = 0  and instead
of the fusion rules of [5], they found the fusion rules of bernard & felder [6]; these fusion

rules are a subset of the rules of [5] in the sense that all couplings allowed by [6] are

allowed by [5], but not all the [5] couplings are allowed by [6].

taking x = 0 is not wrong in a mathematical sense, but rather the mathematics gives

the right answer to what may be the wrong physical question.

we illustrate these points in the simplest non-trivial cases. if we dene  = k+2, then

the simplest representations containing singular vectors which are not of the form f m
or en

1|ri are r =  and r = 22, with singular vectors

0 |ri

and

|1i = (cid:16) f0 f0 e1 + (1) f0 h1 + (1) f1 (cid:17)|i ,

|2i = (cid:16) e1 e1 f0  (1) e1 h1 + (1) e2(cid:17)|22i ,

(3.23)

(3.24)

respectively. these are the two simplest non-trivial representations in the set of pre-

admissible representations, of spins

r  { n  n , n, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ; n + (n + 1) , n, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . } .

(3.25)

it is expected that these representations form a closed subalgebra for generic  6= q.

the admissible representations have  certain rational numbers and spins r a subset

of the pre-admissible representations,

 = p/p ,

r  {nn = (pn)+(pn) , 0  n  p2 , 0  n  p1} . (3.26)

the simplest non-trivial admissible representation is at level k = 4/3,  = 2/3, of spin

r =  = 22 = 2/3; hence both (3.23) and (3.24) are in m in this case, and are the

linearly independent generators of the maximal submodule of m. for this level, there
are only three admissible representations, r  {0, , 2} = {0, 2/3, 4/3}, and we

again expect the fusion algebra to be closed on this set.

18

3.1. the case of x generic

let us rst consider the case x 6= 0, . 2 using equations (3.19) it is straightforward

to show that in a<

x (lr) the singular vectors |1i and |2i are equivalent to

|1i = 

|2i = 

1

8x(cid:16)h  h()  (cid:17)(cid:16)h  h() + (cid:17)(cid:16)h + h()  (2)(cid:17)|i
8 (cid:16)h + h() + 2(1)(cid:17)(cid:16)h + h() + 2(cid:17)(cid:16)h  h()(cid:17)|22i

x

(3.27)

(3.28)

this means that these singular vectors each lead to a single polynomial constraint between

h and h().
if h is in the pre-admissible set, then so is h(), except for the cases
of h being on the edge of the pre-admissible set, that is one of n or n being zero, in

which case the simple constraints arising from the null-vectors in the representation h

must also be taken into account. in each case, the fusion of these two representations with

representations r in the pre-admissible set yields elds r in the pre-admissible set.

the values of (h(), h) which are allowed to couple to the representation |1i are

shown in gure 1.

in the case that  takes the admissible value  = 2/3, we then have  = 22, and

so h and h() must satisfy the two simultaneous equations

(cid:16)h  h()  2

3(cid:17)(cid:16)h  h() + 2

3(cid:17)(cid:16)h + h() + 4

3(cid:17) = 0
3(cid:17)(cid:16)h + h() + 2(cid:17)(cid:16)h  h()(cid:17) = 0

(cid:16)h + h() + 2

the solutions to these simultaneous equations are

(3.29a)

(3.29b)

(3.30)

3 , 0) o ,

(h(), h)  n ( 2

3 ,  2

3 ) , ( 2

3 ,  2

3 ) , (0,  2

3 ) , ( 2

all of which lie in the set of admissible representations with no further constraints necessary.

this corresponds to a fusion matrix for the fundamental eld f = () of the form

nf = 


0 1
1 1
0 1


 .

0
1
0

(3.31)

2 in other words, as stressed in [8], one assigns distinct borel subalgebras to the three elds in
the correlator, or, choosing x = 1, we have b0 = e  h, b = f  h, b1 = (e  h  f )  (h + 2f ).

19

3.2. the case x = 0

in this case we have to consider the constraints arising from the vanishing of all

f0descendents of the singular vectors. taking |1i rst, it is easy to show that the only
relations among the spanning set (3.21) arise from

(f0)p |1i = (cid:16) e1 (f0)2  ( + p + 1) h1 f0  ( + p + 1)( + p) f1 (cid:17) (f0)p |i
(f0)p |1i = ( + p + 1)(cid:16) h    p(cid:17) (f0)p+1 |i .

(3.32)

this makes for quite a complicated structure. for generic ,

0 (l) = c[h] |i (cid:16) p>0 c (f0)p |i(cid:17) .

a<

(3.33)

on the rst summand h() and h are only restricted by h()h = , but on each of the
discrete eigenvectors (f0)p|i they take values {h() =  p  1 , h =  + p  1}. this is
exactly the subset of the spectrum at generic x which satises h h() =0, 2, 4, . . ., and
is also shown on gure 1. the algebraic method exactly reproduces the physically intuitive

result - putting x = 0, one restricts to the subset for which the three-point functions have

a regular expansion around x = 0. (this is essentially the same restriction as that imposed

by [6].)

taking now the case of |2i, we have

(f0)p |2i  p(p)(cid:16)h  (p  1)(cid:17)(cid:16)h +   p + 1(cid:17) (f0)p1 |22i ,

so that

0 (l22) = p0(cid:16)c (f0)p |22i  c h (f0)p |22i(cid:17) .

a<

(3.34)

(3.35)

on each of the two dimensional spaces in the sum in (3.35), h() and h are diagonalisable
with joint eigenvalues (2  p  2 , p) and (  p  2 ,  + p). this is now the subset of
the spectrum at generic x which satises h  h() + 22 = 0, 2, 4 . . .

in the admissible case  = 2/3, both (3.32) and (3.34) must be set to zero in

a<

0 (l2/3). this reduces the space to two dimensions,

c |2/3i  c h |2/3i ,

on which the eigenvalues are

(h(), h)  n ( 4

3 , 0) o ,

3 ,  2

3 ) , ( 2

20

(3.36)

(3.37)

a subset of (3.30), agreeing with the results of bernard & felder. this would correspond

to a fusion matrix for the fundamental eld of the form

nf = 


0 1
0 0
0 0


 ,

0
1
0

(3.38)

which is rather degenerate  for example, it is nilpotent, and there is no conjugate eld f 

such that the identity would appear in the fusion of f and f .

3.3. the case x = 

the case of x =  is analogous to that of x = 0, but since the representation hr| can

also be thought of as having x = , the results are now symmetric in h and h(). in each

case we nd that a<

(lr) consists of the subset of the spectrum for x generic satisfying

h + h()  r = 0, 2, 4 . . ..

for a<

(l) this is now a set of discrete points while (as shown in gure 1) and for

a<

(l22) this a line and a set of points.

in the rational case  = 2/3, the a<

(l) is again two-dimensional, the spectrum

this time consisting of (, 0) and (0, ), leading to a fusion matrix

nf = 


0 1
1 0
0 0


 .

0
0
0

(3.39)

although the matrix (3.39) is symmetric (unlike (3.38)) and thus there is a conjugate

f  = f , it is however decomposable, i.e. as for x = 0 the result for x =  does not satisfy

the usual requirements for a fusion algebra. 3

3 this case appears implicitly in [6], where it is mentioned that both lowest and highest

weight chiral vertex operators are needed to have in particular nonvanishing 2point functions;

the 4point blocks construction in [7] provides explicit examples of mixed correlators. they

can be interpreted as proper limits with coordinates xi taken at 0 or  of a subset of the generic

this line and these points are the joint spectrum of
8( )h        and h for the representation (-    )
xat    =0, a subset of the spectrum at generic  x

figure 1: the spectrum of h() and h on a<

x (l) for generic ,

showing the results for generic x, x = 0 and x = .

3.4. the case of sl(3)

all the preceding discussion passes over to the case of bsl(3), with some minor modica-

tions and some unfortunate complications. we recall that the elds (x) we introduced
earlier are highest weight primary elds for the conjugate algebra generators, satisfying

(cid:2) tm  tm1 , (x) (cid:3) = 0 ,
(cid:2) ei
m , (x) (cid:3) = 0 ,
(cid:2) hi
m , (x) (cid:3) = (hi) (x) .

we are interested in the space of three-point functions

h| (x) |i ,

22

(3.40)

for some highest weight state h| and |i an arbitrary state in some irreducible highest

weight representation l . by analogy to the case of bsl(2) we shall dene a<

x(l ) to be

the quotient

x (l) = l . j l ,

a<

(3.41)

(3.42)

(3.43)

where for nite x j is the linear span of the elements

tnt1 , n > 2 ,

f j
1f j
0 ,

ej
1 .

as before, we dene

h i

() = hi

0  hi

1 , h i = hi

1 ,

which commute on a<
on a<

x(l), and the space of fusions to l is given by the joint spectrum

x (l) of these operators.
from (3.41) and denition of h i, it is clear that for nite x, a<

x(m) is spanned by

the states

(h 1)b1 (h 2)b2 (f 1

0 )a1 (f 2

0 )a2 (f 3

0 )a3 |i ,

ai , bj = 0, 1, . . .

(3.44)

for generic x it is further possible to show that the space a<

x(m) is also spanned by the

states

(h 1

())a1 (h 2

())a2 (h 1)a3 (h 2)a4 (f 3

0 )a5 |i ,

ai = 0, 1, . . . .

(3.45)

the values of x on which this inversion is not possible are similar to the points x = 0, 

the main technical diculty in computing a<

for bsl(2), but are no longer just points but subspaces.
we cannot assume a5 = 0 in (3.45), a<
in m do not just lead to polynomial constraints on h i
just automatically a quotient of c[h i

x (l), even for generic x, is that since
(), h i], singular vectors
x(l) is not
(), h i]. this fact is intimately connected with the
possible existence of verlinde fusion numbers greater than 1, as we shall see. rather,

x (m) is not just c[h i

() and h i, and a<

(as for the case x = 0 in bsl(2)) we must also consider descendents of the highest-weight

singular vectors, and the explicit construction of the space a<

x (l) is rather messy.

we shall not attempt any further general discussion, but simply outline the results

of an explicit calculation in the simplest pre-admissible representation which has fusions

with non-trivial multiplicities.

23

3.5. the representation h

the representation h has weight (  2) and we shall denote the highest weight
state by |hi. the irreducible representation lh is the quotient of the verma module mh
by its maximal submodule which is generated by the two independent singular vectors

|1i = (cid:16) e3
|2i = (cid:16) e3

1 f 2

0  (2  ) e1

1 f 1

0 + (2  ) e2

1(cid:17) |hi ,
1(cid:17) |hi .

(3.46)

using the relations generated by (3.42), the singular vectors (3.46) are equivalent in
mh/j mh to

|1i = (cid:16) 4

|2i = (cid:16) 4

(3.47b)

as is obvious, just considering the constraints in a<
does not lead to any restrictions on h i
analytic method to analyse a<
the constraints arising from many (up to 56) f i
|2i, and have found that a<

x(lh) from these two singular vectors
() and h i. at the moment we do not have an
x(lh), but using mathematica we have investigated explicitly
0descendents of the singular vectors |1i and

x(lh) is (at largest) a direct sum
i=1 c[h 1, h 2]  vi ,

x(lh) = 5

a<

(3.48)

(3.49)

where one choice of vi is:

v1 = (h 1

v2 = (h 1

v3 = (h 1

v4 = (h 1

v5 = (h 1

()h 1)(h 1
()h 1)(h 1
()h 1)(h 1
()+h 1+2)(h 1
()+h 1+2)(h 1

()h 1h 21)(h 1
()h 1h 21)(h 1
()+h 1+2)(h 1

()+h 2+2) |hi
()+h 1+2) |hi

()+h 2+2) |hi

()h 1h 21)(h 1
()h 1h 21)(h 1

()+h 2+2) |hi
()+h 2+2) f 3

0 |hi

of course this representation of the vi is not unique, but it has one advantage in that it
is independent of x. on each of these vectors the actions of h 1
() are given in
terms of h 1 and h 2 by

() and h 2

(h 1

(), h 2

()) =




v1 :
v2 :
v3 :
v4 , v5 :

(h 1  2 , h 1 + h 2 + 1 ) ,
(h 2  2 +  , h 1  2 +  ) ,
( h 1 + 1 + h 2 , h 2  2 ) ,
( h 1 , h 2 ) .

(3.50)

24

this is exactly the same space of allowed fusions as we found in section 3, with the same
multiplicities. note that the representation of v4 presented in (3.49) uses f 3
essential to provide the multiplicity two for the eigenvalues h i

0  this is

() = h i.

viewed as a representation of c[h 1, h 2], a<

x(lh) is ve-dimensional. we can also
choose to x the value of h i to some generic weight  by extending the set (3.42) generating
the right ideal by the combinations h i  (hi). this leads to the smaller space a<
x (lh)
which is genuinely a ve-dimensional vector space over c. there is no canonical choice for
the representatives of a basis of a<
x (lh), but we note that one choice of vectors spanning

the space is the set

{ |hi , f 1f 2|hi , f 2f 1|hi , f 1f 3|hi , f 2f 3|hi } .

although the action of hi
h i

0 on this space has no immediate connection with the actions of
() or h i, this choice does exhibit clearly a connection with the subset of the weight
diagram of the sl(3) adjoint representation of highest weight  = (w0)  the image of
h = w0  k0 under the map  described in [1]. for h i = 0 the set of eigenvalues of h i
() in
(3.50) together with their multiplicities recovers the generalised weight diagram associated

with the representation h. similarly for any preadmissible weight  the eigenvalues of
h i
x(l)0 dene a generalised weight diagram. while for the pre-
integrable sub-series of weights in (1.14) this coincides with the standard weight diagram

() in the space a<

 of the nite dimensional representation of sl(3) of highest weight , we expect that

the generalised weight diagrams introduced in [1] will be reproduced for the sub-series of
(1.14) with  = 0.

time nd a<

we have also repeated the same analysis for the representation f in (1.16) and this
x(lf ) to be a c[h 1, h 2] module as (3.48) with (3.49) replaced by a seven
dimensional space. each set of eigenvalues have multiplicity one in this case, agreeing

with the results of [1].

for non-generic x, e.g., any of x, y or z being 0 or , or satisfying xy  z = 0,

the analysis leading to these results breaks down and the spaces a<

x(l ) are expected to

become more complicated.

it would be nice to nd a general method to treat the case of bsl(3) rather than have

to use explicit calculations in each case, and this is a problem to which we hope to return

in the future.

25

4. conclusions

in this paper we have employed two methods of dealing with the null vectors decou-

pling constraints on some 3point sl(3) invariants. both lead to the same result and are

in full agreement with the fusion rules determined in [1]. we have concentrated here on

preadmissible representations characterised by a generic value of the level, the additional
singular vectors arising at rational level values k + 3 = p/p can be similarly analysed.

the case of non integral (dominant) highest weights reveals a new phenomena, namely

a dependence of the fusion rules on the coordinates of the ag manifold. taking x = 0 or

[5], [8]  the rule in [6], which gives three-point functions with regular power expansions

x =  in the bsl(2) 3point decoupling equations leads to a subset of the generic fusions of
around these points. the extension of this analysis to bsl(3), with the fusion rules in [1]

corresponding to generic x, is possible and reasonably straightforward, if messy.

we have shown how the approach of feigin and malikov produces the correct results

for sl(3) as well as for sl(2). in [9], dong et al. found the same results for the space of
elds a<

x (l0) as feigin and malikov, and called this space a qgraded zhus
algebra. this has the calculational advantage that it is nite dimensional for all admissible

0 (l0) = a<

models, whereas zhus algebra itself is only nite dimensional for unitary models, but the

disadvantage that it is too small and does not agree with zhus algebra in any of the

latter cases except the trivial case of k = 0. there is clearly some point in extending zhus

methods to cover general admissible models, but supposing that [9] is along the right route,
it will certainly be necessary to consider more general spaces a<
than simply a<

0 (l) as in [9] to recover the full non-degenerate fusion rules.

x(l) for arbitrary  rather

the computations here are still not sucient for a full proof that the fractional level

fusion rule multiplicities in [1] are precisely the ones resulting from the solutions of the

singular vectors decoupling equations at generic x. however they strongly support this

expectation in conrming the basic rules for all fundamental representations generating

the fusion ring.

the algebraic and dierential equation methods are clearly equivalent, and for the

model presented here the dierential equation method is much easier to understand and
faster to analyse. however, there are algebras, such as the w (2)
polyakov for which there is no known action of the algebra on the elds in terms of

algebra of bershadsky

3

dierential operators, but for which a naive application of the algebraic method has so far

only produced fusion rules akin to those of [6] for sl(2), with similar problems (nilpotency

26

etc). we expect that the insight gained from these calculations, and the way in which

degenerate fusion rules can be seen as coming from an incomplete parametrisation of the

space of primary elds, will lead to progress on such problems.
