abstract

kaluza-klein sphere reductions of supergravities that admit adssphere vacuum so-
lutions are believed to be consistent. the examples include the s4 and s7 reductions of
eleven-dimensional supergravity, and the s5 reduction of ten-dimensional type iib super-

gravity.
in this paper we provide evidence that sphere reductions of supergravities that
admit instead domain-wallsphere vacuum solutions are also consistent, where the back-
ground can be viewed as the near-horizon structure of a dilatonic p-brane of the theory.

the resulting lower-dimensional theory is a gauged supergravity that admits a domain wall,

rather than ads, as a vacuum solution. we illustrate this consistency by taking the singu-
lar limits of certain modulus parameters, for which the original sn compactifying spheres
(n = 4, 5 or 7) become sp  rq, with p = n  q < n. the consistency of the s4, s7 and
s5 reductions then implies the consistency of the sp reductions of the lower-dimensional
in particular, we obtain explicit non-linear ansatze for the s3 reduction

supergravities.

of type iia and heterotic supergravities, restricting to the u (1)2 subgroup of the so(4)
gauge group of s3. we also study the black hole solutions in the lower-dimensional gauged

supergravities with domain-wall backgrounds. we nd new domain-wall black holes which

are not the singular-modulus limits of the ads black holes of the original theories, and we

obtain their killing spinors.

introduction

kaluza-klein sphere reductions of supergravities that admit adssphere vacuum solutions
are believed to be consistent. the examples include the s7 [1, 2] and s4 [3] reductions of
eleven-dimensional supergravity, and the s5 [4, 5, 6] reduction of ten-dimensional type iib

supergravity. the consistency is important since one can then be assured that the solutions

of the resulting lower dimensional gauged supergravities are also solutions of the m-theory

or type iib theory. these solutions of the gauged supergravities then provide one side of

the picture of the duality [7, 8, 9, 10] between anti-de sitter space and conformal eld

theories on its boundary. the complete proof of consistency is still lacking, owing to the
complexity of the reduction ansatze. the s7 reduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity

is better understood than the other two cases, as a consequence of its having received more

attention owing to its connection with four dimensions. the full non-linear reduction ansatz,

although highly implicit, was given in [11, 12]. recently, explicit non-linear reduction

ansatze that focus on the cartan subgroups of the full gauge groups were obtained for

these three examples [13]. the construction shows that the reduction must be performed

at the level of the equations of motion, rather than in the lagrangian (even when it exists).

furthermore, the consistency of the reduction depends on a delicate balance between the

contributions of the metric and the relevant antisymmetric tensor eld strength in the

higher-dimensional supergravity theory. this conspiracy between the higher-dimensional

elds is equivalent to the one that governs the supersymmetry of the theory.

note that by far the most involved part of establishing the consistency of any sphere-

reduction ansatz is concerned with the contributions of scalar elds that parameterise in-

homogeneous deformations of the sphere metric. specically, it is for these inhomogeneous

deformations that the conspiracies between terms in the higher-dimensional lagrangian are

needed in order to achieve consistency of the reduction. this is in contrast to the situation

in the reduction on a group manifold g, as described in [14], where the scalars parame-

terise only homogeneous deformations, and the consistency of the reduction is guaranteed

for each individual term in the higher-dimensional lagrangian, by virtue of the invariance

of the reduction ansatz under the right action of the group g.

the consistency of the above sphere reductions raises the question as to whether it is

also possible to perform consistent kaluza-klein sphere reductions on other supergravity
theories that do not admit adssphere solutions. adssphere spacetimes can arise as
the near-horizon structures of the m2-brane, m5-brane and d3-brane. in these examples

there are no couplings to scalar elds. however for a generic p-brane that couples to a

2

dilaton, the near-horizon structure of the metric is instead a product of a domain wall1

and a sphere, with a certain warp factor in the metric. (in this paper we shall refer to
this spacetime as a domain-wallsphere, even though the warp-factor implies that the
spacetime metric is not a direct product.) note that super yang-mills eld theories do not

only arise at the boundary of ads space, but also emerge as the world-volume theories of
d-branes. a generic d-brane has a near-horizon structure which is a domain-wallsphere.
this raises the question as to whether supergravity in the d-brane near-horizon background

has anything to do with the super yang-mills theory on the d-brane world-volume. the

correspondence of supergravity on a domain-wall background with quantum eld theory on

the wall was proposed in [15].

in this paper, we shall address the following question: is it consistent to dimensionally
reduce the theory with a domain wallsphere solution on the associated sphere? if so, what
will be the lower-dimensional theory? in the adssphere compactication, the lower-
dimensional theory is a gauged supergravity that allows an ads spacetime as a vacuum

solution. in other words, the scalar potential of the spherically-reduced theory has at least

one stationary point. we refer to these theories as ads supergravities. in the new cases

that we wish to consider here, we would expect that the lower-dimensional theory would

instead admit a domain wall, rather than an ads spacetime, as its vacuum solution. we

refer to such theories as domain-wall supergravities. before we address the question

of the consistency of such a reduction, we shall rst examine whether there exist lower

dimensional theories that admit such domain-wall solutions.

let us consider gauged d = 7, n = 2 supergravity as an example. the bosonic sector

of the supergravity multiplet contains the metric, a dilaton a 3-form vector potential and

su (2) yang-mills gauge elds. the lagrangian has the following form [16, 17]

note that the 3-form gauge potential has a topological mass term, with mass parameter m.

(1.2)

where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to y. for generic non-vanishing m and g,

we can obtain an ads7 spacetime by sending q to zero. in either of the special cases where

m=0 or g = 0, the domain wall has no ads7 limit.

let us rst examine the case when g = 0. it was observed in [19] that the corresponding

domain wall can be obtained from the vertical dimensional reduction of an m5-brane, whose

charges are uniformly distributed over four of the transverse dimensions, which are taken

as the compactication coordinates. the eleven-dimensional 5-brane has the form

ds2

11 = h1/3dxdx + h 2/3(dy2 + ds2

4) ,

f4 = q 4

(1.3)

where ds2

4 is the metric of a four-dimensional at space, with 4 being its volume form.
thus the g = 0 limit can be viewed as m-theory compactied on a 4-dimensional at space.

the topological mass term of the 3-form gauge potential has its origin in the f f a term of

eleven-dimensional supergravity.

the m = 0 limit is quite dierent. we nd that its higher-dimensional origin is from

the near-horizon limit of the ns-5brane in d = 10, which has the metric

ds2

10 = h1/4dxdx  + h 3/4(dr2 + r2 d2

3) ,

(1.4)

with h = 1 + q/r2. in the near-horizon limit, we shall have h  q/r2.

the seven-dimensional theory (1.1) can be obtained from the s4 reduction of m-theory.

with the parameters g and m both non-zero, it allows ads7 as a vacuum solution.

in

one singular limit, where g = 0, it can be obtained from m-theory on a 4-dimensional at

background, with the 4-form eld strength having a term proportional to the volume form

of the internal space. such a reduction is indeed consistent, giving rise to a 3-form gauge

potential with a topological mass term [19]. the vacuum domain-wall solution in d = 7 has

its origin as a 5-brane in d = 11, with its charges uniformly distributed over the internal

space. in the other singular limit, with m = 0, the vacuum domain-wall solution has its
origin instead as the s3 reduction of the ns-5brane in d = 10.

the above example illustrates that there should exist two dierent singular limits of the
s4 reduction of m-theory, in one of which the internal 4-space becomes at, while in the

other the internal space limits to 4-space that contains a 3-sphere factor. the consistency
of the s4 reduction of m-theory thus implies the consistency of the s3 reduction of the

ten-dimensional theory.

4

the main purpose of this paper is to examine the above conjecture in detail. in section 2,
we show that there exist singular limits in certain modulus parameters such that s4 becomes
either a at four-space ir4, or else s3  ir. in the at-space limit, the m-theory becomes a
massive supergravity in d = 7 with a topologically massive 3-form potential. in the s3  ir
limit, the m-theory becomes a gauged supergravity, but with no massive 3-form potential.

we also obtain new domain-wall black holes in these limiting cases. these are analogous to

the ads black holes of gauged anti-de sitter supergravities, but with asymptotic structures

that approach domain walls rather than ads spacetimes.

in section 3, we study the s7 reduction of m-theory, and show that there exist singular
limits in certain modulus parameters such that s7 becomes s3  ir4 or s5  ir2. we also
obtain supersymmetric domain-wall black holes in the original theory before taking the

limit. we study how the solutions behave under these limiting procedures. in section 4, we

turn out attention to the s5 reduction of the type iib theory, and we nd a singular limit
where s5 becomes s3  ir2. we also obtain new supersymmetric domain-wall solutions in
the limiting theory. in the appendix, we obtain a general class of domain-wall black holes.

2 s4 reduction of m-theory, and its limits

in this section, we show that there exist singular limits in certain modulus parameters
such that s4 becomes either a at four-space ir4, or else s3  ir. in the at space limit,
the m-theory becomes a massive supergravity in d = 7 with a topological massive 3-form
potential. in the s3  ir limit, the m-theory becomes a gauged supergravity, but with no
massive 3-form potential. this observation give a geometrical interpretation of the massive,

but ungauged supergravity in d = 7 and the gauged massless d = 7 gauged supergravity,

in terms of taking limits of certain modulus parameters. we also obtain new domain-wall

black holes in these limiting cases. for appropriate choice of parameters these solutions are

supersymmetric.

we begin this section with a review of the kaluza-klein reduction from d = 11 to d = 7
on s4. as we said in the introduction, it is believed, although it is strictly speaking still

only a conjecture, that the maximal n = 4, so(5) gauged supergravity in d = 7 can be
obtained by performing a kaluza-klein reduction on s4 accompanied by a truncation to

the massless supermultiplet of elds. we shall consider the further restriction discussed in
[13], where the so(5) gauge elds are truncated down to the abelian u (1) u (1) subgroup,
and correspondingly just two of the scalar elds of the full n = 4 theory are retained. the

it was shown in [13] that after substituting (2.1) and (2.2) into the eleven-dimensional

(2.12)

the potential v becomes exactly the same as the one given in (1.1), after dropping the

primes on the rescaled coupling constants.

2.1 limit to at space

in this subsection, we consider a limiting procedure in which the s4 reduction reviewed

above becomes a reduction on a at internal space, giving rise to a seven-dimensional theory

that is equivalent to one obtained by a certain toroidal compactication from d = 11. to do

this, it is useful rst to apply the appropriate limiting procedure in the seven-dimensional

theory itself.

from (2.5) and (2.6), we see that the scalar potential (2.11) is given by

v = g2(cid:16)  4e 1

2 (~a1+~a2)~  2e

1

2 (~a1+2~a2)~  2e

2 (~2a1+~a2)~ + 1

2 e2(~a1+~a2)~(cid:17) .

(2.13)

we now make the following redenitions of elds and the gauge coupling constant g:

(2.14)

where  is a constant. it follows from (2.6) and (2.5) that x1 and x2, and the auxiliary

quantity x0, will suer the rescalings

xi = e

5  xi ,

x0 = e 4

5  x0 ,

(2.15)

where i runs over the values 1 and 2. substituting into the seven-dimensional lagrangian
(2.10), and then taking the limit   , we arrive at the lagrangian

2xi=1

(2.16)

where, having taken the limit, we have then suppressed the primes on the redened elds.

this corresponds to the limit where the parameter g in (1.1) is set to zero.

the theory described by the lagrangian (2.16) is one that can be obtained by means

of a toroidal reduction from d = 11, in which the usual kaluza-klein ansatz is generalised

somewhat by allowing the inclusion of a constant 4-volume term q (4) in the ansatz for the

eleven-dimensional f(4). in terms of an ansatz on the 3-form potential, this corresponds to

allowing a linear dependence on one or more of the toroidal compactication coordinates

[19, 21]. here, our goal will be to show how this theory can be obtained by taking an
appropriate limit in the s4 reduction described above.

the required limiting process that we shall apply to the s4 reduction ansatz given in

(2.1) and (2.2) is governed by what we already determined in d = 7, where the appropriate

scalings of elds and the gauge-coupling g were established. it is evident that to obtain a

regular limit, it is necessary also to apply an appropriate rescaling to the coordinates 

involved in the parameterisation of the 4-sphere. we nd that the necessary rescalings are

as follows:

0 = 0 ,

i = e

1

2  i .

(2.17)

2 + e i i = 1, will imply that 0

note that as we take the limit   , the quadratic constraint (2.4), which becomes
2 = 1, while the two quantities i will become uncon-
0
5  x0.
applying this limiting procedure to the s4 reduction ansatze (2.1) and (2.2), we therefore
nd that in the limit where   , the dominant terms in the eleven-dimensional metric
and 4-form become

strained. also, the quantity e dened in (2.3) will, in the limit, be given by e  e 4

(2.18)

(2.19)

here, we have dropped the primes on all the elds and the coupling constant, after having

taken the limit.

note that the overall -dependent prefactors in the above expressions, although diver-
gent as   , do not give rise to any singularity in the seven-dimensional equations of

8

motion. the reason for this is that there is a scaling symmetry of the eleven-dimensional

supergravity equations of motion, referred to as a trombone symmetry in [22], under

which the metric and the 3-form potential scale by the constant factors

gm n  k2 gm n ,

a(3)  k3 a(3) .

(2.20)

(more generally, any theory with an einstein-hilbert term and quadratic eld-strength

kinetic terms will have such a scaling symmetry if the metric and the gauge potentials each

scale with a power of k equal to the number of indices carried by the metric or potential.)

this is a symmetry of the equations of motion. it is not a symmetry of the action, which

scales by a uniform constant factor under this transformation. bearing in mind that the

ansatz for f(4) given in (2.19) is for the dual of f(4), which is a 7-form in d = 11 and thus
would have a 6-form potential, the powers of e in the prefactors in (2.18) and (2.19) are

seen to be precisely of the correct form to factor out in the equations of motion by virtue

of the scaling symmetry.

it is now quite straightforward to see that in this limiting situation, the metric and 4-

form ansatze are in fact equivalent to standard ones on a 4-torus. to see this, let us dene

new coordinates (z1, z2, z3, z4) in place of (1, 2, 1, 2), where

z1 = 1 cos 1 ,

z2 = 1 sin 1 ,

z3 = 2 cos 2 ,

z4 = 2 sin 2 ,

in terms of which the metric ansatz (2.18) becomes

similarly, we may express the 4-form ansatz in terms of the z coordinates. it is convenient

at the same time to perform a dualisation, so that we express the ansatz on the 4-form

itself, rather than its dual. upon doing so, we nd that (2.19) becomes

the reduction ansatze (2.22) and (2.23) that we have arrived at in this limiting case are

equivalent to those for a kaluza-klein reduction from d = 11 on a 4-torus, with certain of

the elds set to zero, and with the inclusion of a scherk-schwarz type generalisation in the

reduction ansatz for the 4-form eld strength. in such a reduction, before setting any of

the elds to zero, we would have

specically, the two 2-form eld strengths that survive in (2.23) correspond to the two

parameterised as x1 and x2 in the ansatze (2.22) and (2.23), correspond to two specic
surviving combinations of the four dilatons ~ of the 4-torus reduction.

2.2 limit to s3  ir
the other limiting case that we wish to consider corresponds to setting the parameter m to

zero in (1.1). in terms of the description of the seven-dimensional theory at the beginning

of this section, this limit is achieved by making rescalings analogous to (2.14) and (2.15),

where, having taken the limit, we have again suppressed the primes on the redened elds.

this corresponds to the limit where the parameter m in (1.1) is set to zero.

we may again now consider the limiting procedure from the viewpoint of the ansatze

for the eleven-dimensional elds. it is easily seen in this case that we should rescale the

coordinates  in the 4-sphere as follows:

0 = e 1

where again we have suppressed the primes on the various elds and coordinates, and on g,

after having taken the limit.

the four coordinates i and i, together with the quadratic constraint (2.30), can be

recognised as parameterising a 3-sphere in the internal space (see equation (2.9)). the

coordinate 0, which is now unconstrained, parameterises the fourth of the directions in

the internal space. initially, the 0 coordinate was one of three that were subject to the

quadratic constraint (2.4) in the original 4-sphere. a parameterisation of the original 

in terms of two unconstrained angles could be taken to be 0 = cos 1, 1 = sin 1 cos 2,

2 = sin 1 sin 2. thus 0 originally ranged over a nite line segment. as the limit
  + is taken, this line segment expands to cover the entire real line.

we can use the s3  ir limit of the s4 reduction ansatz that we have just obtained in
order to describe an s3 reduction of ten-dimensional type iia supergravity. to do this,
we break the s3  ir reduction up into two steps, the rst of which consists of reducing
from d = 11 to d = 10 on the ir direction. of course since this corresponds to a killing

symmetry of the ansatz, generated by /0, we can choose to re-interpret 0 as an angular
ignorable coordinate on s1, rather than a coordinate on the real line. at the same time, we

11

can exploit the trombone scaling symmetry of the d = 11 equations of motion to eliminate
the e factors in the limiting form of the ansatze.

to implement the resulting s1 reduction, we use the standard kaluza-klein metric

ansatz

ds2

11 = e 1

6  ds2

10 + e

3  (dz + a(1))2 .

(2.35)

for the 4-form, we have f4 = f(4) + f(3)  (dz + a(1)), with f4 = da(3)  da(2)  a(1) and
f(3) = da(2). from these ansatze, it is easy to see that we shall have

 f(4) = e

2  f(4)  (dz + a(1)) + e f(3) ,

(2.36)

where we are using  here to denote an eleven-dimensional hodge dual, and  to denote a
ten-dimensional one.

from the above, it follows that the s3  ir metric and 4-form reduction ansatze (2.33)

and (2.34) can be re-interpreted as type iia s3 reduction ansatze with

we arrived at the above ansatze for the s3 reduction of type iia supergravity by taking
a singular limit of the s4 reduction of d = 11 supergravity. however, having obtained it

by this method, we can now view it as a valid reduction procedure in its own right.
in
particular, by virtue of the previously-established consistency of the s4 reduction, we now
know that this procedure has provided us with a consistent s3 reduction scheme for the

type iia theory, leading to the seven-dimensional lagrangian given in (2.27). in particular,

this is an example of a non-trivial sphere reduction (i.e. one that includes scalars describing

inhomogeneous sphere deformations) that gives rise to a gauged supergravity with no ads

vacuum.

note that the ramond-ramond elds f(4) and f(2) are set to zero in the ansatze (2.37)
for the s3 reduction of type iia supergravity. this means that we can also interpret it
as an s3 reduction of the n = 1 or heterotic theories in d = 10. although 0 naturally

12

became a coordinate on the entire real line in the taking of the singular limit of the s4

compactication, the consistency of the kaluza-klein reduction does not of itself require

that 0 cover the innite interval. we could instead impose a cut-o on the interval, and
require instead that 0 range only over a nite line segment, s1/z2. this could then be

combined with a projection in which the ramond-ramond elds were set to zero, precisely
in the fashion of the s1/z2 reduction of m-theory introduced in [25]. thus the reduction

ansatze (2.33) and (2.34), where the ramond-ramond elds in d = 10 have already been
projected out, can also be viewed as a consistent reduction ansatz for m-theory on s3 
(s1/z2). the limit that was taken in arriving at (2.33) and (2.34) from the s4 reduction
ansatz however implies that the line segment s1/z2 expands to become ir; this corresponds

to strongly coupled heterotic string theory (and the topological information encoded in
s1/z2 is lost).

2.3 new domain-wall black holes in d = 7

having obtained the two singular limits of the 4-sphere reduction of eleven-dimensional

supergravity, it is of interest to study how the solutions behave in these limits. one example

was already illustrated in the introduction, where a domain-wall solution supported purely

by the scalar potential was presented. as we discussed there, the limits associated with

m = 0 and g = 0 give rise to domain walls that can be respectively interpreted as the near

horizon of an isotropic ns-ns 5-brane or an m5-brane, with charges uniformly distributed

over a at four-space. in this subsection, we obtain a new domain-wall black-hole solution,

which is not merely the singular-modulus limit of the previously known ads black hole.

the lagrangian (1.1) admits ads7 black hole solutions, given by

ds2

7 = h8/5 f dt2 + h 2/5 (f1dr2 + r2 d2

f = k

(2.38)

where d2

5,k is the metric on a unit s5, t 5 or h 5 according to whether k = 1, 0 or 1. (note
that the solution was previously obtained in [13, 26] for g = m.) in particular the k = 0

solution can be oxidised back to d = 11 and becomes [27, 13] the near horizon structure of

the rotating m5-brane [28]. we see that the solution (2.38) does not admit an m = 0 limit.
it does, however, allow us to take the limit g  0, provided that g sinh2   q is held xed.
the solution then reduces to a domain-wall black hole.

13

although the solution (2.38) does not admit an m = 0 limit, there does exist a new

domain-wall black hole solution for the lagrangian (1.1) when m = 0. in fact when m = 0,

the lagrangian ts precisely the general pattern in (a.5) in the appendix. it follows that

the domain-wall black hole is given by

examination of the  variation indicates that the domain-wall black hole (2.39) is in

p = 1

(2.42)

note that 0 and 1 denote the dirac matrices with vielbein indices in the t and r directions

respectively. for such spinors , the gravitino variation reduces to

(2.44)

where 0 is an arbitrary constant spinor. note that the projection p0  1
2 (1 + i0) indicates
that the domain-wall black hole preserves exactly half of the supersymmetries when  = 0.

to summarise, we have seen that there are two distinct domain-wall black hole solutions

in d = 7, corresponding to the limiting cases where g = 0 or m = 0. the former, describing

a domain-wall black hole with k = 1, corresponds to a solution of the theory obtained by
compactifying d = 11 supergravity on ir4; this itself, as we saw, is a singular limit of the
s4 compactication. the other domain-wall black hole, with m = 0, has k = 0. this
corresponds to a solution of the s3  ir compactication from d = 11, which is another
singular limit of the s4 compactication.

3 s7 reduction of m-theory, and its limits

let us now turn to the four-dimensional theory obtained by the dimensional reduction of
m-theory on s7. we shall consider two limits that correspond to consistent reductions on
s3  ir4 and s5  ir2. we also nd new domain-wall black hole solutions.

as shown in [13], there is an n = 2, u (1)4 truncation of the full n = 8 gauged
supergravity, for which the explicit kaluza-klein reduction ansatz can be given.2 the

reduction ansatz is

scalars that are present in the u (1)4 ansatz given in [13]. if one is considering solutions such as the 4-charge

ads black holes of d = 4 gauge supergravity [29], for which the axions can be set to zero, this truncation

of the axions is justied.

in terms of this basis, the scalar potential in d = 4 is given by

v = 4g2 xi<j

xi xj = 8g2 (cosh 1 + cosh 2 + cosh 3) ,

3.1 limit to s3  ir4
let us rst consider a limit where the dilaton 1 is subjected to the following shift:

1 = 1   ,

(3.8)

with 2 and 3 unchanged. this will give a nite lagrangian as   +, provided that
the coupling constant and the gauge potentials are scaled as follows:

and a = (3, 4). note that the quantities xi scale as

xa = e

1

2  xa ,

xa = e 1

2  xa .

after these redenitions, the scalar potential in (3.7) becomes simply

v = 4g2 e1 .

(3.10)

(3.11)

we nd that these scalings can be implemented in the metric and 4-form ansatze (3.1)

and (3.2) if we also make the scalings

a = a ,

a = e 1

as a reduction on s3  ir4.

substituting these ansatze into the eleven-dimensional equations of motion, we will

obtain equations of motion that can be derived from the following four-dimensional la-

grangian:

2 ( ~)2 + 4g2 e1  1
e1l4 = r  1
4 e1(cid:16)e23 (f 3

(2) = f(2)/2. thus we arrive at the truncated lagrangian
2 (1)2  1

for simplicity, we may now consistently set 2 = 3 = 0, provided that we also set f 1
f 2

(2)  f(2)/2 and f 3

(3.16)

the eld strengths f(2) and f(2) play quite dierent roles in this truncated theory. as can
be seen from the ansatze (3.13) and (3.14), the eld f(2), which is associated with f a
(2), is in

the cartan subgroup of the original gauged supergravity yang-mills group. on the other
hand f(2), associated with f a
(2), is in the ungauged sector corresponding to the ir4 part of
the s3  ir4 limiting compactication.

3.2 domain-wall black holes in d = 4

in the previous section, we singled out the scalar 1, making a rescaling under which the
7-sphere becomes s3  r4. we then consistently set 2 and 3 to zero, provided that

17

(2)  f(2)/2 and f 3

(2) = f 2
f 1
f(2) = 0. in this section, we shall accordingly look for solutions to the lagrangian

(2) = f(2)/2. for further simplicity, we shall set

(2) = f 4

e1l4 = r  1

2 ()2  1

4 e (f(2))2 + 4m2 e + 4g2 e + 16m g .

(3.17)

note that we have introduced an additional constant parameter m, by making a constant

shift of the dilaton , accompanied by a redenition of g. for non-vanishing m and g, the

scalar potential is equivalent to the one obtained by setting 2 = 3 = 0 in (3.7). the

n = 2 supersymmetry transformation rules for the fermionic superpartners are given, in a

purely bosonic background, by

here d2

2,k denotes the metric on a two-dimensional space of positive, zero or negative
constant curvature, according to whether k is positive, zero or negative. by convention,
we take the spaces with k = +1 and k = 1 to be the unit s2 and hyperbolic space h 2
respectively. note that the solution with k = 1 corresponds to a special case of the 4-charge

ads black holes found in [29], where just two equal charges are turned on. the solution
with k = 0 can be obtained from the s7 reduction of the near horizon structure of the

rotating m2-brane [13]. it is straightforward to check that in the extremal limit, where  is
sent to zero while holding  sinh2  xed, these ads black-hole solutions preserve one half

of the n = 2 supersymmetry.

we see that these solutions do not allow an m = 0 limit to be taken, but they do permit
us instead to take the g  0 limit provided    with g sinh2   q held xed. in this

18

limit we nd

(3.21)

which describes an electrically charged domain-wall black hole for non-vanishing k. on the

other hand, when k = 0 the above solution is a pure domain-wall black hole with vanishing

electric charge.

the scalar potential in (3.17) has a symmetry    + 2 log g  2 log m. accordingly

we nd a solution where e = h rather than e = h given by

where the constant parameters satisfy

m2 2 + 2g q (m  + g k q) = 0 .

(3.22)

(3.23)

thus we have two possibilities. if m 6= 0 this solution is in fact equivalent to (3.20). this
may be seen by performing a coordinate transformation

t =

m

r =

(3.24)

and making the identication

g 
m

(1 + 2k sinh2 ) ,

q =  sinh2  ,

2g 
m

 =

sinh (1 + k sinh2 )1/2 .

(3.25)

after dropping the tilde this may be seen to be identical to (3.20). on the other hand, if

m = 0 then  is no longer constrained by (3.23). in this case the constraint requires k = 0

for non-vanishing q. for m = 0, k = 0 the solution cannot be obtained from the original

ads4 black hole of (3.20). nevertheless, the lagrangian (3.17) ts the pattern of the generic

class of lagrangians (a.5) given in the appendix, and the solution is a special case of (a.6).

in this case, the parameter q can be absorbed into a rescaling of coordinates. the solution

with m = 0 was obtained in [30].

from the transformation rules (3.19), we nd that these  =  log h domain-wall black

holes preserve half the n = 2 supersymmetry if the following condition hold:

q =

the conditions (3.26) imply that the function f in the metric is given by

(3.27)

when k = 1, so that we have s2 surfaces with d2

the killing spinors are now given by

 = [qh1/2 + r1/2 qh1/2  r1/2 1](1 + i0)0 ,

(3.29)

(3.30)

where h = 8g2q2r + 2r1. note that these killing spinors have the same structure as
(2.44) corresponding to the domain-wall black hole solution in the m = 0 limit of d = 7,

n = 2 gauged supergravity.

to summarize, we have seen that in addition to the known ads4 black hole solutions to

(3.17) for non-vanishing g and m, there are also domain-wall black hole solutions in the two

distinct limits: g = 0 with k = 1, and m = 0 with k = 0. in both cases, these correspond to
new solutions in the s3  ir4 compactication of m-theory. when m = 0 the domain-wall
black hole is electrically charged in the cartan subgroup of the gauge elds arising from s3.
when g = 0 the charge is instead carried by a eld strength coming from the ir4 reduction.

3.3 limit to s5  ir2
there is a dierent limit which we may consider, in which three exponentials, rather than
only one, survive in the original potential in (3.7). to do this, we redene ~ according to

~ = ~ + ~a1  ,

(3.31)

and then send   +. the necessary scalings now imply

potential in (3.7) now becomes

v = 4g2 (e1 + e2 + e3) .

in this case, we can recognise the reduction as being on s5  ir2.

3.4 limits of solutions

as we have seen in the previous section, the s5  r2 limit is obtained by uniformly shifting
the three dilatonic scalars i. in fact it is possible to have a consistent truncation of the
lagrangian (3.7) such that all the three scalars are equal, i.e. i = /3, provided that all
but one of the vector potentials are set to zero. it follows that the lagrangian becomes

e1l4 = r  1

2 ()2 + 12m2 e/3 + 12g2 e/3  1
4 e

3  f 2

(2) .

(3.36)

note that we have again introduced the additional parameter m, by shifting  and rescaling

g appropriately. for non-vanishing m and g, the values of m and g are unimportant, since

they can be changed by a constant shift of the dilaton . the lagrangian admits a single
charge ads4 black hole, (i.e. a = 3,) given by

(3.37)

as in the previous cases, the solution does not admit an m = 0 limit, but it does allow
a limit where instead g  0,    with g sinh2  held xed, in which case the solution
becomes a domain-wall black hole.

4 s5 reduction of type iib theory, and its limit

the kaluza-klein reduction of type iib supergravity on s5 is expected to admit a consistent

truncation to gauged n = 8 supergravity in d = 5, with so(6) yang-mills gauge elds

in the supergravity multiplet. as usual, the complexity of the reduction procedure has

prevented any complete results from being obtained. however, in [13], it was shown that a
further truncation to n = 2 supergravity in d = 5, with just the u (1)3 cartan subgroup of

the so(6) yang-mills gauge elds surviving, is explicitly embeddable in d = 10 type iib

supergravity. the ansatz found in [13], which gives a consistent truncation to the n = 2

supermultiplet comprising the graviton, three u (1) gauge elds, and two scalar elds is

note that this solution was obtained in [31] for m = g. when k = 0, it can also be obtained

that the solution does not have an m = 0 limit, but it does have a g  0 limit with g sinh2 
held xed, which gives rise to a domain-wall black hole solution with k 6= 0.

when m = 0, the lagrangian ts the general pattern of the lagrangian (a.5) in the

5 conclusions

we studied in detail a class of consistent kaluza-klein sphere compactications of string/m-

theory whose eective theories reduce to gauged supergravity theories that do not admit

anti-de sitter (ads) space-time as a vacuum solution. we refer to them as domain-wall

supergravities. this class of supergravity solutions can be viewed as particular limits of

24

the (standard) ads gauged supergravity theories in d = 7, 4, 5, which are obtained as
kaluza-klein compactications on s4 and s7 of eleven-dimensional supergravity and on s5

of ten-dimensional type iib supergravity.

we obtained specic limits of ads gauged supergravity theories by taking certain mod-
uli, associated with the non-homogeneous deformations of sn, to their boundary values,
which result in compactications of string/m-theory on sp  rq (p + q = n) spaces and
correspond to domain-wall supergravities. we classied such possible limits for the abelian

truncations of the gauged ads supergravities in d = 7, 4, 5. a particular instructive exam-
ple is a limit of m-theory compactications on s4 which reduces to a compactication on
s3  r, and a domain-wall supergravity in d = 7. this compactication can be reinter-
preted as a consistent compactication of type iia theory on s3. the limiting procedure we

employed highlights a geometrical interpretation of the massive, but ungauged supergravity

in d = 7 and the massless d = 7 gauged supergravity.

since the sphere compactications of the ads supergravities are believed to be consis-

tent, it follows that the resulting domain-wall supergravities are consistent sphere compact-

ications of higher dimensional supergravities as well. while these domain-wall supergrav-

ities were obtained as certain limits of ads supergravities, they now stand as valid sphere

compactications in their own right.

typical solutions of domain-wall supergravities are of the (black-hole) domain-wall-type,

i.e. asymptotically the congurations have non-constant scalar elds. we have shown how

some of these solutions can be obtained as limits of the existing (black-hole) solutions of

the corresponding ads gauged supergravities. however, we have also found new classes of

domain-wall black holes that cannot be obtained as special limits of the ads supergravity

solutions and have shown that they are supersymmetric. these sets of solutions may play

an important role in the study of the dual quantum eld theories (qft), according to the

proposed domain-wall/qft correspondence [15].

note added:

after this work was completed, a paper appeared in which the complete non-linear

ansatz for the s4 reduction of d = 11 supergravity was presented [34].
