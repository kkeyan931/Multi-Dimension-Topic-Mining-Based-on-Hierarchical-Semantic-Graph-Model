(3.2) (3.3) equation (3.2) remarkably similar analogous result derived d-branes  (see also  ), despite two calculations rather dierent, describing dierent physical systems. indeed, d-brane calculation involves single oscillator a, excites modes one unit kaluza-klein momentum ; present elementary string calculation involves excitations an, an, n = 1, ...,, specic way dictated vertex insertion. analogy black holes , eq.
