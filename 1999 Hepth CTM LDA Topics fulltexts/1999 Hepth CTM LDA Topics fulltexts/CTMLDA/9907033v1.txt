on alternate derivation of type iib matrix model

abstract

starting with green-schwarz superstring action, we construct a type iib matrix

model. we x the local  symmetry in the killing spinor gauge and then perform the

world-sheet duality transformation. a matrix model obtained from this gauge-xed

action is shown to be equivalent to the type iib matrix model constructed by ishibashi

et al. our construction does not make use of an analytic continuation of spinor variable.

moreover, it seems that our construction is applicable to that of more general type iib
matrix models in a curved background such as ads5  s 5.

matrix models provide us non-perturbative formulations of m theory [1] and type iib su-
perstring theory [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. it is quite surprising that such simple supersymmetric quantum
mechanics theories seem to contain within them a complicated structure of supergravity.

despite much remarkable success of matrix models, we are still far from having a complete
understanding of several important problems. in particular, one big mystery is the problem
of background independence [7]. the actions of the matrix models [1, 2] include a at metric
in the kinetic and/or the potential parts, which is not allowed as stressed in a previous
article [8]. this is because matrix models, which describe quantum gravity, should pick up
its own space-time background in a dynamical manner and should not be a priori formulated
in a specic xed background. thus it is desirable to construct a matrix model which is
independent of background metric [9], but its relation to quantum gravity is not clear at
present. another interesting approach would be construction of a matrix model in an arbitrary
curved background. (but we believe that the background is not completely arbitrary in that
the backgorund elds would have to satisfy the proper on-shell constraints of supergravity in
order that the action is -symmetric.)

recently, in an attempt of constructing a type iib matrix model on ads5  s 5 [10], we
have utilized the killing spinor gauge developed in [11, 12] as the gauge-xing condition of
the -symmetry.
(see also related works [13, 14, 15].) the aim of the present article is
just to apply the method developed there to the case of a at background geometry. indeed,
following the method we will obtain the same matrix model as found by ishibashi et al [2]. one
advantage of our construction is that we do not have to make use of an analytic continuation
of spinor variable in the path integral as used by ishibashi et al. instead, we will use the
killing spinor gauge and the world-sheet duality symmetry of type iib superstring theory.
another advantage is of course that our construction is extensible to construction of more
complicated matrix models [10].

first of all, let us start with the type iib green-schwarz superstring action in a at

background in the nambu-goto form [16]:

s = s1 + s2 = z d2(l1 + l2),

l1 = s
l2 = iijix a(1aj1  2aj2) + ij 1ai1 2aj2

here i are majorana-weyl spinors in ten dimensions and various indices take the following
values: i, j, ... = 0, 1; a, b, ... = 0, 1, ..., 9; i, j, ... = 1, 2.

it is straightforward to check that this action has the n = 2 supersymmetry [2]

si = i ,
sx a = iiai ,

i = i,
x a = iiai,

and the local -symmetry

where

1 = (1 + )1,
2 = (1  )2,

2 = +1.

now let us x the -symmetry in the killing spinor gauge [11, 12]. the at minkowskian
space-time has the poincare group iso(1, 9) as the isometry group, so it is natural to consider
the following killing spinor gauge condition for the case at hand

j = 0,

i
  p ij

is dened as

where the projection operator p ij

p ij


=

(ij  i11ij),

(8)

with the chiral matrix 11 = 01...9. (the other simple choice of the projection operator is
2(ij  iij). it is easy to see that this choice leads to the same result as that shown
p ij

in this paper.) note that this projection operator satises the following identities:

= 1

p 2


= p,

p+p = pp+ = 0,
pa = ap.

as a result, we can show

iaii = 2iai,

kij iaij = 0.

where we have dened 1
+ = . the latter equation in eq.(10), together with eq.(2), leads
to the fact that the wess-zumino term l2 vanishes in the present gauge condition. thus, we
arrive at the -symmetry gauge-xed action given by

where

the -symmetry gauge-xed action (11) is still quartic with respect to the fermionic
variable, but it is possible to reduce it to a much simpler quadratic form by making the
world-sheet duality transformation as follows [12]. to this aim, let us rst rewrite the action
(11) into the polyakov form

s = 

1

2 z d2ggij(ix a  2iai)(jx a  2iaj).

(13)

next, we rewrite the action (13) into the rst-order form by introducing the lagrange multi-
plier p a
i

s = 

1

2 z d2ggijhp a

i p a

j + 2p a

i (jx a  2iaj)i .

(14)

actually the integration over p a
then solving the resulting equation in terms of the dual variable x a as

i gives rise to the action (13). after integrating out x a and

p ia =

1

g

ijj x a,

we can obtain the desired dual action

s = 

1

2 z d2(ggiji x aj x a + 4iiji x a aj).

(15)

(16)

it is quite remarkable that the -symmetry gauge-xed action (11) is transformed to a much
simpler quadratic form through the world-sheet duality transformation.

the action s is still invariant under the residual n = 2 supersymmetry. this supersym-
metry can be found by amalgamating the original supersymmetry (4) with the -symmetry
(5) to preserve the gauge xing condition (7), in other words, 1 = i112. following a sim-
ilar procedure to the reference [2], let us consider the mixed transformation of the n = 2
supersymmetry (4) and the -symmetry (5)

i = si + i ,
x a = sx a + x a.

provided that we dene 2 = i112 and 2 = i112 and then choose

1 = 1 + 2

2 =

(18)

the gauge xing condition is preserved as desired. with these conditions and the denition

it is easy to derive the new n = 2 supersymmetry law of  whose result is given by

 =   ,

(19)

(20)

whereas it is necessary to make some work to do the transformation law of x a. in a similar
way to the case of , we can nd the new n = 2 supersymmetry transformation law of the
original variable x a

which gives us the transformation of p a
i

x a = 2ia( + ),

p a

i = 4ii a .

(21)

(22)

from this expression, we can derive the the new n = 2 supersymmetry law of x a

(23)
note that to derive this equation we have used the fact that gij  can be replaced with ijg
i since both the expressions make the same contribution in the action s. at this stage,
in p a
it is important to notice that  can be expressed in terms of the dual variable as

 x a = 4ia.

 =

2g

i x aj x bijab.

finally, integrating out gij, we nish with the dual action

s = z d2(s

2

2 + 2iijix a aj).

the n = 2 supersymmetry of this action is then given by

 = 
x a = 4ia.

(24)

(25)

(26)

in the above equations, we have written x a simply as x a and dened ab as

ab = ix ajx bij.

(27)

these expressions are equivalent to those in [2], so we can obtain the same type iib matrix
model by following the same path of thought as in [2]. notice that even if we have derived
the same matrix model by starting with the same type iib superstring action (1), (2) the
derivation method is dierent.
in particular, our approach does not rely on an analytic
continuation of the spinor variable in the path integral which plays an important role in [2]
and seems to be extensible to more general situation [10]. of course, the key idea behind
the approach at hand is a symmetry of the green-schwarz superstring action [16] under
the world-sheet duality transformation. incidentally, we have recently examined the duality
transformations of the green-schwarz superstring as well as supersymmetric d-brane actions
in a general type ii supergravity background [17].
