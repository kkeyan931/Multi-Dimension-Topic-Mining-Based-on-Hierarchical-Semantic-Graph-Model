abstract

we study thermodynamical aspects of string theory in the limit in which it corresponds to non-
commutative yang-mills. we conrm, using the ads/cft correspondence, that for general dp
branes the entropy in the planar approximation depends neither on the value of the background
magnetic eld b nor on its rank. we nd 1/n 2 corrections to the planar entropy in the wkb
approximation. for all appropriate values of p these corrections are much softer than the cor-
responding corrections for the b = 0 case, and vanish altogether in the high temperature limit.

introduction

in string theory, the perturbative two-dimensional world-sheet data contains information about
the target-space geometry background on which the string propagates. perturbatively one ex-
pects that an eective target-space theory will have on its world volume a denite geometry, the
very same as that encoded in the two-dimensional world-sheet theory. however, one knows from
t -duality that the metric on that world-volume may actually be ambiguous [1]. moreover there
is no a priori reason why new ambiguities may not emerge also non-perturbatively. actually in
some topological world-sheet theories the topology of the target space in the sigma-model does
not dene unambiguously the topology of the world-volume in target space [2]. in other cases
such as type iia string theory the world-volume dimensionality of the eective target-space
theory is larger than ten and is actually eleven [3].

recently [4, 5] it was found that the world-volume of the eective target-space theory may
be smaller than that excpected from the two-dimensional sigma-model, moreover the eective
target-space theory may be just a eld theory not containing gravity. for example n = 4, d = 4,
supersymmetric yangmills (sym) describes a string propagating in the ten-dimensional target
space ads5s5. not only are the geometry, the dimensionality and topology of the target-space
manifolds largely modied but also the commutativity properties of the target-space coordinates
were found to be ambiguous:
in a certain limit [6], in which the background eld b is non-
vanishing in some directions, the metric components are of o() and the string regge slope  is
of order o(), a string probe will not distinguish between one gauge system on a target-space
manifold whose variables are commutative and another gauge system on a noncommutative
(nc) target space whose coordinates satisfy [7]

[xi, xj] = i ij,

(1.1)

with   b1. this limit has been studied from various points of view, in particular as a
limit of m -theory [8, 9]. for many years one has been curious about the manner in which such
non-commutativity would inuence the behaviour of the system. given that in string theory
there are equivalences between theories on commutative and non commutative spaces it may
have not been a total surprise that the entropies of both systems were found to be indentical
in a certain large n limit. in fact it was shown that, at the level of the large-n diagrammatic
combinatorics, the modications implied by the presence of the torsion can be relegated to
torsion-dependent phase factors mutiplying torsionless n-point functions in momentum space
[10, 11]. in particular zero-point functions such as the free energy and the entropy are unchanged.
although the close similarity of thermodynamical functions at low temperatures (compared to
the noncommutativity scale) was expected, the fact that similarities persist, for large n , at
high temperatures was more of a surprise. these identities have been demonstrated also by
applying the ads/cft correspondence and considering the supergravity limit on the ads side,
a description valid at strong t hooft coupling g2
ymn  1. the appropriate mastereld has been
identied for the zero-temperature system [12, 13] and the additional mastereld, a black-hole
conguration, has been identied for the nite-temperature case [13]. while these supergravity
congurations do depend on the background torsion eld, it has been shown by calculating
classically the black-hole entropy that large n thermodynamical functions are b-independent.
the classical supergravity results capture the leading n properties of the gauge-theory side.
there are no known limitations, based on diagrammatic analysis, on the b-dependence of the
entropy to next to leading order in 1/n 2. it may not be so easy to estimate these corrections in

1

the non-commutative gauge-theory language. however one may also approach the calculation
from the supergravity side of the correspondence. we have used in ref. [14] a wkb approxima-
tion to estimate the next to leading order eects on the entropy for vanishing values of b. this
method did not take into account stringy quantum corrections but did account for quantum
corrections to the classical supergravity picture. this is actually usefull for the limit at hand in
which stringy eects are decoupled.

as the main result of this paper, we nd that the indroduction of the magnetic b-eld, or in
other variables a non-innite  background, leads to a large suppression of the next to leading
order free energy and entropy, in fact the entropy correction vanishes at large temperatures,
leaving only the leading order entropy. equivalently, the limit of innite nc length   ,
at xed energy is completely saturated by the planar limit. for vanishing , i.e. for the gauge
theory on a commuting manifold the next to leading order results are of the same qualitative
properties as the leading result.

in section 2 we review the wkb approximation to the 1/n corrections to the free energy
and entropy. we apply the method to obtain highly suppressed 1/n corrections in the case of
the four-dimensional gauge theory, i.e. the case of a large stack of n d3-branes. we also recover
the commuting case results for a vanishing value of , that is in the limit of small and large b
elds.

in section 3 these results are generalized to dp branes (as well as ns5-branes). we study
the entropy of the system as a function of both p and the rank r of the magnetic eld b. for
all p < 7 the large-temperature planar entropy of the black-hole conguration does not depend
on the value of b. the more complicated behaviour for 7 > p > 4 is also unchanged. the 1/n 2
corrections do depend on the value of b. the main result is again that we nd them to be
always much softer than those corresponding to the b = 0 case. we nally touch upon the most
general conguration which supposedly describes the supergravity side in the aditional presence
of a constant electric eld.

after this work has been completed we received the article [20], which contains some overlap

with the material in section 3.

2 wkb estimations of 1/n corrections to the entropy

in the context of the ads/cft correspondence, the sum over diagrams with toroidal topology
in the t hooft classication should be related, at strong coupling, to the one-loop diagrams of
the corresponding dual string theory. in our case, we are interested in the one-loop (toroidal
world-sheet) diagram of type iib string theory in the appropriate string background which leads
to a gauge theory.

lacking an operative description in terms of an exact cft, the calculation of this diagram
in closed form is beyond our capabilities. we can, however, produce estimates by means of
approximations to its low-energy limit: the one-loop diagrams of iib supergravity.

one observable which is rather independent of the regularization ambiguities of supergravity
is the vacuum-subtracted statistical free energy. at one-loop, the supergravity elds can be
regarded as free (interacting only with the background) and the thermal free energy can be
evaluated by means of an oscillator sum for each eld:

 f () = xspecies

tr (1)f log (cid:16)1  (1)f e (cid:17) ,

(2.2)

2

where f is the space-time fermion number and the trace is over the spectrum of physical uc-
tuations in the background, with frequencies  given by the eigenvalues of the operator it,
associated to one particular temporal killing vector of the background, which we assume static.
if we evaluate (2.2) by some determinant on the compactied euclidean continuation of the
background, the inverse temperature  is the period of identication of the euclidean time.

the vacuum energy has been subtracted in this denition of the free energy, so that the

relation to the one-loop path integral is

under the assumption of local extensivity we can estimate the statistical sum by

i (1) =  evac +  f ().

(2.3)

(2.4)

 f () z ddxq|g| loc f0(loc),

with a red-shifted local inverse temperature local = g00, and f0 the at-space free energy.
namely, this is an adiabatic approximation in which one assumes local thermal equilibrium
in cells which are still small compared to the global features of the geometry, so that their
contribution to the total free energy is given by the red-shifted at-space free energy of the cell,
and one further assumes extensivity with respect to the partition in cells. these assumptions
can be justied with a standard application of the wkb approximation to the solutions of the
wave equation 2 + 2
t = 0 (see for example refs. [15]). thus, the wkb approximation is good
if the metric is suciently smooth. for example, for adsd+1 with radius r, the derivative of
the inverse local temperature |rloc| is bounded by /r, with  the temperature at the centre.
according to the ads/cft correspondence, this ratio is small precisely in the high-temperature
limit, and our wkb approximation is better the higher the temperature.

for massless elds in d space-time dimensions, one has f0 = a t d1, with a a constant
proportional to the total number of particle degrees of freedom. thus, the wkb approximation
involves integration of (g00)1d over the volume. a more geometrical characterization can be
given dening the optical metric [16] by the conformal transformation

ds2

optical =

1
g00

ds2

euclidean,

(2.5)

from the wick-rotated metric with compact time t  t + . then, the contribution of a given
region x of space-time to the one-loop free energy is proportional to the optical volume of this
region, which we shall denote by gvol(x).

for space-times with a black hole, we should consider only the optical volume of the region
not excluded by the black-hole horizon. the reason being that the euclidean metric of a black
hole terminates at the horizon, which represents a radial cut-o. strictly speaking, the red-
shift estimate breaks down very close to the horizon, because the local temperature diverges.
this local divergence can be interpreted as contributing to the renormalization of the newton
constant, as in ref. [17]. thus, in dealing with black-hole spacetimes, we shall consider only the
optical volume of the asymptotic region, suciently far from the horizon, i.e. we consider the
free energy of the hawking radiation in equilibrium with the black hole. this naive subtraction
of the horizon divergence is enough for the purpose of order of magnitude estimates [14].
for a curved space-time, a eld is regarded as massless if its mass is smaller than the local
temperature tloc = t /g00. otherwise, it is massive, and can be decoupled from the statistical

3

sum in that region of space-time. this means that, for a situation with locally varying kaluza
klein thresholds one may partition the whole manifold x in cells xi of eective dimension
di, dened by the condition that the eective radii be suciently large compared to the local
temperature:

(2.6)
finally, neglecting threshold eects, from the regions where loc  rloc, the wkb approxi-

mation to the one-loop free energy can be written:

i (1)

wkb =  evac xi

ai t digvol(xi),

(2.7)

for a decomposition in cells xi, each of eective naive dimension di.

if we can isolate a regime where the dominant asymptotics is of the form f  a t , the

corresponding one-loop entropy is

in this case, we can dene

s(1)
wkb  ( + 1) a t .

de =  + 1

(2.8)

(2.9)

to be the eective dimension, as determined by the high-temperature asymptotics. notice
that this dimension is in general dierent from the naive dimensions di of the cells in which
we have partitioned the manifold. the reason is that the optical volume of a given cell may
depend non-trivially on the asymptotic reference temperature. for example, for adsd+1, and
generalizations involved in the ads/cft correspondence, the eective dimension as dened by
the high-temperature asymptotics is d instead of d + 1, [14, 18]. this is in fact a manifestation
of holography at the level of o(1/n 2) corrections.

2.1 the basic example
the simplest example is given by the gravitational description of the n = 4 sym theory at large
n , obtained from a stack of d3-branes with a non-zero b-eld on a single spatial two-plane.
at large t hooft coupling  = g2
ymn , the master eld of the theory with a nc parameter  is
encoded in the metric derived in refs. [12] and [13]:

(2.10)

f (u ) =

(2.11)
and  = 1/4 . notice that the perturbative nc energy scale, 1/2, diers by powers of
the t hooft coupling from the value of the u -coordinate threshold for the onset of nc eects in
the metric (2.10), which is given by u = 1/. the associated length scale in the gauge theory,
according to the uv/ir correspondence [22], is given by

1 + (u )4

it diers from the weak-coupling nc scale, , by powers of the t hooft coupling1. the small
u or infrared region is the standard ads5  s5 space with radius r =  1/4, in agreement
with expectations, since nc eects should be irrelevant in the deep infrared regime. conversely,
the   0 limit at xed energy and coupling gives back the standard large n master eld of the
commutative theory.
in the non-extremal case the horizon sits at u0 = t. the local value of the inverse
temperature is loc =  u r/ for u  u0, while the local value of the s5 radius is r(s5) = r.
so, for u > u0 = t we drop the ve-sphere and the eective (euclidean) optical metric of
interest is

optical = dt2 + dy2 + f (u ) dx2 +

but a large suppression for very high temperatures, compared to the nc scale at  1:

(2.18)

this means that the one-loop free energy scales like a vacuum contribution in the large
temperature limit at  1. in other words, the 1/n 2 corrections to entropy vanish in such a
limit: the extra contribution from the extreme ultraviolet regime is as if it represented a zero-
dimensional volume. as mentioned in the introduction, the planar o(n 2) entropy is expected to
be the same as the non-commutative one, on the grounds of weak-coupling arguments [11]. this
fact was veried at strong-coupling in ref. [13], i.e. the horizon area in einstein frame does not
change beyond the nc scale a. our result indicates that, at least to leading order, the source
of all the high-temperature entropy is in the planar evaluation of degrees of freedom.

conversely, we can say that, in the limit of large nc parameter   , at xed energy, we
are led to a purely planar theory, in the sense that the large n description is eectively classical
(trivial 1/n corrections).

most of the previous discussion admits generalization to general dp-branes with 1 < p < 7. the
supergravity string-frame solution for a stack of n dp-branes with an aligned b-eld (before
the decoupling limits) is given in ref. [13]:

the low-energy scaling introduced by seiberg and witten in ref. [6] shrinks the closed string
metric in the direction of the x coordinates, with a constant b-eld. we may achieve this in the
previous solution by a rescaling of the coordinates x  x/, in the   0 limit with constant

b-eld transforms like a normal tensor under the rescaling: b  b  (/)2. in terms of the
convenient nc length scale  dened by

this result agrees with the recent determination of this function in ref. [19]. the u -dependent
b-eld prole is

b = b (u )7p f (u ),

(3.27)

with b = 1/. this asymptotic value of the b-eld agrees with the zero slope limit of ref. [6]
for the nc parameter matrix:

ij = 2(cid:18)

1

g + 2b(cid:19)ij

a

(3.28)

with gij the closed-string metric. a potential confusion stems from the fact that the nc param-
eter in this formula vanishes both for large and small values of the b-eld. on the other hand,
if b = 1/, the limit of vanishing b-eld seems to make nc eects blow up. this is resolved
by noticing that the nc parameter vanishes with the b-eld only if  and the closed-string
metric are kept xed, namely the two limits that turn-o  do not commute. in the supergravity
solution, keeping the open-string scale xed (borninfeld corrections) amounts to keeping the
1
neck of the throat at us  (/()2)
7p in place in the full solution (3.19). if we now take
the vanishing b-eld limit with constant gij and constant , we nd f ()  0 and nc features
vanish as it should be.

coming back to the scaled solution, the dilaton is

e2 = g2
s

f (u )r h(u )

3p

2 = e2c f (u )r,

(3.29)

where c denotes the dilaton of the  = 0 theory.

with these data, one could study the interplay of phase transitions in these models, de-
pending on the local duality transformations appropriate for each description. compared to the
analysis of the commutative case in ref.
[21], the nc character introduces a new scale in the
problem at u = 1/, associated to the onset of nc eects. the corresponding length scale in
the gauge theory, according to the generalized uv/ir correspondence of [22] is

a =s 

u 5p



=  5p.

(3.30)

following [21], the applicability of the supergravity description is controlled by the size of 

corrections in the string-metric background. in terms of the correspondence point uc = 
of ref. [23], one nds that the geometric description is good for u  uc when p < 3. therefore,
we need u < uc in order to trust the supergravity solution in the region where nc eects
are sizeable. in terms of the t hooft coupling versus the gauge-theory nc length scale, this
condition is 3p a < 1, i.e. we require a sucently weak coupling. otherwise, the nc features
of the ultraviolet regime must be studied entirely by means of perturbative techniques.

3p

1

for p = 3, the condition for the supergravity picture to capture nc features in the ultraviolet

is the ordinary one, independent of the scale:  > 1.

features are visible in the supergravity description for suciently strong coupling:  > a.

on the other hand, for p = 4 the supergravity patch is u  uc = 1/, so that the nc
finally, the cases p = 5, 6 are somewhat dierent since they do not follow a standard ir/uv
correspondence (equation (3.30) does not have a clear physical interpretation in these cases).
still, we can associate nc eects to the energy scale u, as measured for example by the mass of

7

a stretched fundamental string probe. the condition for the metric (3.25) to accurately describe
the nc eects is thus  (u)p3 > 1.

the non-perturbative thresholds associated with large values of the string dilaton are gen-
erally relaxed by turning on the nc moduli. since f  u p7 vanishes in the large u regime,
this means that the present metrics have small local string coupling in the u   region for all
values of p, provided r  1 (in fact, one needs the slightly stronger condition r  2 for p = 6).
following the general rule, the infrared thresholds associated with small u < u singularities
are qualitatively the same in the nc case.

in general, there could be intermediate regimes with large local string coupling, but such
transients can be ignored when working in the t hooft limit with xed values of the typical
energies in the system, as well as  and , of o(n 0).

3.1 planar thermodynamics

the (somewhat surprising) robustness of the planar thermodynamics of the p = 3 case, discussed
in [13], persists for general values of p. the non-extremal metric is obtained by replacing

 dt2  +hdt2,

du 2  du 2/h,

with the euclidean time identied with period the inverse temperature t  t +  and

h = 1  (u0/u )7p

(3.31)

(3.32)

as usual. since no b-eld lies in the time direction, these replacements do not aect the parts
of the metric which depend on  (the x space). therefore, the nc hawking temperature is the
same as in the commutative case.

tn c = tc =

4 s u 5p

7  p

0


.

(3.33)

moreover, the planar entropy is also independent of the nc deformation parameter. since

it must be computed in the einstein frame, we have to multiply the string metric by

en c /2 = ec /2 f (u )r/4.

the horizon being eight-dimensional, this yields a factor of ( f r/8)8, which exactly cancels the

extra factor of(cid:18)q f(cid:19)2r

horizon area is

coming from the 2r directions with a non-vanishing b-eld. so, the nc

an c = ac ( f 1/2)2r ( f r/8)8 = ac.

(3.34)

both the planar entropy and the temperature are exactly the same as in the commutative case,
which means that all planar thermodynamical functions are the same.

3.2 wkb corrections to the entropy

in order to estimate the 1/n corrections, we consider the corresponding optical metric

ds2

optical = dt2 + dy2 + f (u ) dx2 +


u 7p (du 2 + u 2d2

8p),

(3.35)

8

and compute the optical volume of the region u0 < u < . the conditions for decoupling the
angular sphere s8p are the same as in the commutative case, again because the nc character
only aects the xspace. we discuss the qualitatively dierent cases in turn.

dp-branes with p < 5

for p < 5, the temperature is small: loc > r(s8p)loc in the region of interest, so that
we can drop the angular sphere in estimating the free energy of thermal radiation outside the
black-brane.

i (1)

wkb  t p+2gvolp+2 = t p+1 lpz 
this is the standard result of the commutative theory i (1)
other hand, in the opposite limit t a  t5p  1, we get a strong suppression

.

(3.37)

thus, we nd the soft behaviour at high temperatures of the one-loop free energy, much like the
d3-brane case. notice that for all p < 5, the asymptotic eective exponent of t is negative pro-
vided r  1. therefore, the eective dimensionality, as determined by the one-loop corrections,
drops to zero or is even negative at t a  1.

d5-branes

for p = 5 one gets, independently of the issue of angular decoupling:

i (1)

wkb  (l t )5z

(1 + (xu0)2)r .

(3.38)

as long as r > 0, the integral converges! this is an improvement with respect to the commutative
case, with  = 0, in which one gets a logarithmic divergence of dubious interpretation. in the
u0  1 regime one nds

i (1)
wkb  

(l t )5
(u0)2r .

(3.39)

however, now the energy-density parameter u0 is unrelated to the temperature, which is constant
and equal to 1/2, i.e. there is a suppression of the non-planar corrections, although the eective
dimension remains de = 6.

d6-branes

on the other hand, for p = 6, the local temperature outside the horizon is higher than the
mass of angular modes and we must consider the optical volume of the angular sphere s8p as
well. the resulting one-loop free energy is

i (1)

wkb  (l t )6z

(1 + xu0)r .

(3.40)

now, we need a b-eld turned on in at least two planes (r > 1), in order to achieve convergence
at large u (this is reminiscent of the analogous condition to have a vanishing string coupling
at innity). in any case, the interpretation is not clear, because the standard uv/ir relation
breaks down at the level of the formula for the hawking temperature, since large energies (large
u0), correspond to low temperatures.
in fact, the scaling at large temperature is that of a
higher-than-seven-dimensional theory:

i (1)
wkb  

(l t )6
(u0)r  l6 a2r t 6+2r.

(3.41)

therefore, the cases p = 5, 6 continue to have non-standard features, although we do see a

general tendency of the b-elds to make the large u behaviour less singular in all cases.

other models

these wkb estimates can be extended to other interesting models. for example, we may
consider ns5-branes of type iib and iia related to d5-branes by a sequence of s- and t -
dualities. the behaviour of 1/n 2 corrections for all these models is essentially equivalent to that
of type iib d5-branes, i.e. the commutative versions have semi-innite cylinders that produce
logarithmically divergent hawking-radiation entropies [24, 14, 18]. on the other hand, turning
on b-elds regulates this divergence and implies an eective quenching of 1/n corrections at
large temperature. this is particularly clear for the case of type iib ns5-branes, whose metric
is s-dual to that of d5-branes. since this duality amounts to a conformal transformation of the
metric, to which the optical metric is insensitive, we get the same physics of 1/n 2 corrections:
for large energy densities u0  1,

type iia ns5-branes can be obtained from type iib ns5-branes by a further t -duality along
a commutative direction. we have a global factor of f r/2 from the s-duality transformation
from d5-branes to type iib ns5-branes. t -duality inverts this factor on one of the commuting
coordinates. in addition, there are the usual factors of f for each nc coordinate. thus, the
optical volume integrand gets an additional factor of f r/2 in all, leading to

again in the large density limit. when the type iia ns5-solution is lifted to eleven dimensions,
one obtains a nc m5-brane model with ads7s4 geometry in the infrared region. the previous
scaling gives now

we remark that one interesting case was not discussed here in detail. it is the case in the
presence of a nonvanishing electric ns-elds: b0i 6= 0. naively, one expects similar results to
the purely magnetic case, at least as far as the arguments of ref.
[11] concern. however, it
was pointed out in ref. [13] that, at least in the particular case of p = 3, r = 2, the supergravity

10

picture of the thermodynamics is fundamentally dierent at temperatures of the order of the
timelike noncommutative scale.

assuming that, for b0i 6= 0, the dominant nite-temperature master eld (the black hole)
is also given by the substitutions (3.31) and (3.32) on the extremal solution, one nds that the
behaviour described in [13] for p = 3 actually generalizes to all dp-branes (this assumption
might actually hide important subtleties, related to the proper treatment of the wick rotation).
the perturbative scale of electric non-locality is e = 1/b0i. at large t hooft coupling it
develops into the length scales

that characterize the supergravity solution. the temperature is related to the horizon radius

u0 by t = tc(u0)q f (u0), where tc is the temperature of the commutative theory and fe(u )
is given by eq.
(3.26) upon replacing  by e. this temperature/mass relation leads to
negative specic heat for u0  1/e and a maximum temperature of order tmax  1/ae, a
behaviour reminiscent of standard black-branes in asymptotically at space, before the near-
horizon scaling is taken as in eq. (3.19). in fact, the einstein-frame metrics are exactly equal
to the string-frame metrics of such asymptotically at d-brane metrics (up to some rescalings
of the coordinates,) precisely if 2r = p + 1, i.e. when all the world-volume of the brane is
noncommutative. this property was noticed in ref.
[13] for the p = 3, r = 2 case. however,
we see that the important qualitative features (a maximum temperature and a negative specic
heat branch at large energy densities) generalize for arbitrary values of p and r, provided the
time direction is noncommutative.

having asymptotically at regions at large u will surely complicate the workings of holog-
raphy in these models.
in particular, our wkb estimate for the one-loop entropy gives a
ten-dimensional contribution, s(1)  t 9, from supergravity modes at large u  1/e in these
models. perhaps the theory imposes an eective cuto of order umax  1/e already at the pla-
nar level, as suggested by the existence of a maximum temperature at this scale. in this respect,
it is interesting to notice that the branch with negative specic heat at large energy densities
is dynamically suppressed in the canonical ensemble. the planar entropy in these models is
given by s = fe(u0)1/2 sc, with sc the entropy function of the commutative theory. using
the t (u0) function one nds that the entropy scales as s  n 2 t p8 in the negative specic
heat branch. from here one can get the free-energy excess over the vacuum:
