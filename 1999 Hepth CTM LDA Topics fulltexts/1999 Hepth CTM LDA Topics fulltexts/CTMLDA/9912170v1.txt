we give a new formula for the antipode of the algebra of rooted trees, directly in terms of the
bialgebra structure. this provides a short proof of the equivalence of the bogoliubov-parasiuk-
hepp and the zimmermann renormalization procedures.

keywords: antipode, rooted tree, renormalization.

1. introduction

more than two years ago, kreimer [9] discovered that there is a hopf algebra struc-
ture encoding zimmermanns forest formula [12] in perturbative renormalization theory.
shortly afterwards, an essential coincidence was found between kreimers algebra and the
hopf algebras introduced by connes and moscovici in connection with the index problem
for k-cycles on foliations [5].

a unied treatment in terms of the algebra of rooted trees hr was developed in [2]:
there to each (supercially divergent) feynman diagram a sum of rooted trees is assigned;
the assignment is straightforward when the diagram contains only disjoint or nested sub-
divergences (as then it leads to a single tree), but it also works for overlapping divergences.
the central role in the application of kreimer-connes-moscovici algebras is played by
the antipode. in [2] two equivalent denitions of the antipode in hr were given, repre-
senting respectively the recursive bogoliubov-parasiuk-hepp procedure for renormalizing
feynman integrals with subdivergences, and zimmermanns forest formula that solves that
recursion; that indeed they correspond to the antipode of the hopf algebra of rooted trees
is implied rather than proven.

here we construct the antipode for hr, giving a new formula for computing it in terms
of the coproduct; and then we show its equivalence to each of the formulae by connes and
kreimer in turn.

2. the antipode of the hopf algebra of rooted trees

to establish the notation, we briey recall some basic facts concerning the antipode

of a hopf algebra (consult [1,6,8,11] for proofs), and then the algebra of rooted trees.

given a unital algebra (a, m, u) and a counital coalgebra (c, , ) over a eld f, the
convolution of two elements f, g of the vector space of f-linear maps hom(c, a) is dened
as the map f  g  hom(c, a) given by the composition

 c  c

c

f g
 a  a

m a.

1

this product turns hom(c, a) into a unital algebra, where the unit is the map u  . in
this paper f is the eld of real numbers r.

a hopf algebra is a bialgebra h = (a, m, u, , ) together with a (necessarily unique)
convolution inverse s for the identity map idh. the map s is usually called the antipode
of h. the property idh s = s  idh = u   boils down to the commutativity of the
diagram:

h  h

o

h

 /

/ h  h

id s

u

sid

m /

/ h

mo

h  h.

h  h
j  a

j , then

(2.1)

(2.2)

in particular, if (a) = pj a
and likewise (a)1h = pj s(a

j)a
j .

(a)1h = u  (a) = m  (id s)  (a) = pj a

js(a

j ),

the antipode is always a unital algebra and a counital coalgebra antihomomorphism.
when h is either commutative or cocommutative, s2 = id; in particular, s is bijective in
such cases. another important property is that a bialgebra morphism : h  h  between
hopf algebras is automatically compatible with the antipodes:   s = s   [7,11].

a rooted tree is a nite set of points, called vertices, joined by oriented lines that do
not intersect, so that all the vertices have exactly one incoming line, except the root which
has only outgoing lines. in particular, there is a unique branch that joins the root with
any other vertex. one actually works with isomorphic classes of trees. two rooted trees
are isomorphic if the number of vertices with given length and fertility is the same for all
possible choices of lengths and fertilities, where the fertility of a vertex is the number of
its outgoing lines and its length is the number of lines that make up the unique branch
joining it to the root.

for concrete examples, it will be convenient to have a list of a few isomorphic classes

of rooted trees, say with four vertices or fewer:

a simple cut c of a tree t is a subset of its lines such that the path from the branch to
any other vertex includes at most one line of c. deleting the cut branches produces several
subtrees; the component containing the original root (the trunk) is denoted rc(t ). the
remaining branches also form rooted trees, where in each case the new root is the vertex
immediately below the deleted line; pc(t ) denotes the set of these pruned branches. here,
for instance, are the possible simple cuts of t42:

the set of nontrivial simple cuts of a tree t will be denoted by c(t ); we consider also

the empty cut c = , for which r(t ) = t and p(t ) = .

the algebra of rooted trees hr is the commutative algebra generated by symbols t ,
one for each isomorphism class of rooted trees, plus a unit 1 corresponding to the empty
tree; the product of trees is written as the juxtaposition of their symbols. the counit
 : hr  r is the linear map dened by (1) := 1r and (t1t2 . . . tn) = 0 if t1, . . . , tn
are trees. kreimer dened a map : hr  hr  hr on the generators, extending it as
an algebra homomorphism, as follows:

1 := 1  1; t := t  1 + 1  t + xcc(t )

pc(t )  rc(t ).

(2.3)

notice that pc(t ) is the product of the several subtrees pruned by the cut c. for instance,

(t1) = t1  1 + 1  t1,
(t2) = t2  1 + 1  t2 + t1  t1,
(t31) = t31  1 + 1  t31 + t2  t1 + t1  t2,
(t32) = t32  1 + 1  t32 + 2t1  t2 + t2
1  t1,
(t41) = t41  1 + 1  t41 + t31  t1 + t2  t2 + t1  t31,
(t42) = t42  1 + 1  t42 + t1  t32 + t2  t2 + t1  t31 + t2t1  t1 + t2
(t43) = t43  1 + 1  t43 + 3t1  t32 + 3t2
1  t2 + t3
(t44) = t44  1 + 1  t44 + t32  t1 + 2t1  t31 + t2

1  t1,
1  t2.

1  t2,

(2.4)

a most useful tool is the sprouting of a new root; namely the morphism l: hr  hr

given by the linear map dened by

l(t1 . . . tk) := t,

where t is the rooted tree obtained by conjuring up a new vertex as its root and extending
lines from this vertex to each root of t1, . . . , tk. for instance,

l(cid:16) 

 (cid:17) =

99




99
 

and l(cid:16)





(cid:17) =


99
 



the proof that  is indeed a coproduct is based on the formula

  l = l  1 + (id l)  .

(2.5)

(2.6)

for details see [2] or [6].

when dealing with particular hopf algebras, the antipode is often determined by
specic properties of the algebras in question, and the dening property of the antipode
is scarcely used. the latter turns out to be extremely useful in our context, however. we
compute the antipode s: hr  hr by exploiting its very denition as the convolution
inverse of the identity in hr, via a geometric series:

s := (id)1 = (u    (u    id))1 = u   + (u    id) + (u    id)2 +   

3

lemma 2.1. if t is a rooted tree with n vertices, the geometric series expansion of s(t )
has at most n + 1 terms.

proof. the claim is certainly true for t1. assume that it holds for all trees with n vertices.
let t be a rooted tree with n + 1 vertices; then

(u    id)(n+2)(t ) = (u    id)  (u    id)(n+1)(t )

= m  [(u    id)  (u    id)(n+1)]  (t )
= m  [(u    id)  (u    id)(n+1)]

(cid:18)t  1 + 1  t + xcc(t )

pc(t )  rc(t )(cid:19).

the rst and second term vanish because (u    id)1 = 0. by the induction hypothesis
the third term is zero.
(cid:3)

as an immediate corollary we obtain that s so dened is indeed the antipode.
one of the advantages of this formulation is that we obtain a fully explicit formula for

s from the coproduct table. if a  h n, (a) = pi1

and in general (a

i1  a
a
i1,...,ik+1 , then

i1 , (a

i1 ) = pi2

i1,...,ik ) = pik+1

for instance, using (2.4),

s(t42) = t42 + (t1t32 + t2
= t42 + t1t32 + t2

similarly, if we denote by t the rooted tree in (2.5) with 5 vertices, then

s(t) = t + (2t1t42 + 2t2t31 + t2
2 + 2t2
= t + 2t1t42 + 2t2t31  t2

in correspondence with bogoliubovs recursive formula for renormalization, equations
m  (s  id)  (t ) = 0 and (2.4) suggest to dene the antipode recursively, as indeed done
by connes and kreimer:

sb(t ) := t  xcc(t )

sb(pc(t ))rc(t ).

4

for instance,

sb(t42) = t42  sb(t1)t32  sb(t2)t2  sb(t1)t31  sb(t2t1)t1  sb(t2

1)t2,

which gives again (2.7). we next check that sb is indeed the antipode.

proposition 2.2. if t is any rooted tree, then s(t ) = sb(t ).

proof. for convenience, we abbreviate  := u    id. the statement holds, by a direct
check, if t has 1, 2 or 3 vertices. if it holds for all rooted trees with at most n vertices and
if t is a rooted tree with n + 1 vertices, then

s(t ) = (t ) +

n

xj=1

n

= t + m 

j  (t ) = t + m (cid:18) n
xj=1
j  (cid:18)t  1 + 1  t + xcc(t )

= t  xcc(t )
xj=1
= t  xcc(t )

sb(pc(t )) rc(t ) = sb(t ),

j(pc(t )) rc(t )

n

j  (cid:19)  (t )

pc(t )  rc(t )(cid:19)

where the penultimate equality uses the inductive hypothesis.

(cid:3)

zimmermanns forest formula corresponds to the following nonrecursive formula for

the antipode:

sz(1) := 1, sz (t ) :=  xdd(t )

(1)#dpd(t )rd(t ),

where d(t ) is the set of all cuts, not necessarily simple, including the empty cut, and #d
is the cardinality of d.

proposition 2.3. if t is any rooted tree, then s(t ) = sz(t ).

proof. first we prove that, for an arbitrary rooted tree t ,

s(l(t )) = l(t )  s(t ) t1  xcc(t )

s(pc(t )) l(rc(t )).

(2.8)

indeed, if t has n vertices, then, by lemma 2.1 and (2.6),

s(l(t )) = l(t ) + m (cid:18) n
xj=1
xj=1
j  (cid:0)l(t )  1 + (id l)  (t )(cid:1)

j  (cid:19)  (l(t ))

= l(t ) + m 

n

= l(t ) + m 

n

xj=1

j  

(cid:18)l(t )  1 + t  t1 + 1  l(t ) + xcc(t )

pc(t )  l(rc(t ))(cid:19)

= l(t )  s(t ) t1  xcc(t )

s(pc(t )) l(rc(t )).

suppose that sz were also to satisfy (2.8). since any rooted tree can be written as
an image of l, and on the right side s is applied only to rooted trees of strictly fewer
vertices, the proposition will follow by induction on the number of the vertices. it remains,
therefore, to prove that (2.8) holds for sz.

for a given rooted tree t , let 0 be the new line in l(t ), and v1, . . . , vk the vertices
of length one with respect to the root of t . now d(l(t )) = a  b where d  a or b
according as 0  d or not. thus,

sz(l(t )) = (cid:18)xda

+ xdb

(cid:19)(1)#dpd(l(t )) rd(l(t )).

(2.9)

if d  a, then e = d\{0} is a cut of t ; moreover, rd(l(t )) = t1, pd(l(t )) = pe(t )re(t )
and #d = #e + 1, so that the rst sum of (2.9) equals s(t ) t1.

for a given d  b \ {} and each j  k =: { 1, . . . , k }, let j be the line in d closer to
the root that is linked to vj (if any). then c := { j: j  k } is a simple cut of t . if #c is
odd, we set c := c, whereas if #c is even, we set c := c\{s}, where s is the smallest integer
in k for which there is a line with the required property. in either case, we take e := d \ c.
clearly rd(l(t )) = l(rc(t )), (1)#d+1 = (1)#e, and pd(l(t )) = pe(tc)re(tc), where
we use the temporary notation tc := pc(t ). it follows that the second sum of (2.9) equals

xcc(t ) xed(tc)

(1)#epe(tc) re(tc) l(rc(t )) =  xcc(t )

sz(pc(t )) l(rc(t )).

finally, since the summand for the empty cut is l(t ), the proposition is proved.

(cid:3)

in summary, modulo the distiction between the antipode and the twisted or renor-
malized antipode [3,4,10], kreimers algebraic approach allows a new, indirect but rather
quick, proof of the equivalence of the bogoliubov-parasiuk-hepp and the zimmermann
procedure for renormalizing feynman integrals with subdivergences.
