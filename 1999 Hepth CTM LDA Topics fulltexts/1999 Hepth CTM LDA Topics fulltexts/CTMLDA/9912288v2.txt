abstract

on the supergravity side, we study the propagation of the rr scalar and

the dilaton in the d3-branes with ns b-eld. to obtain the noncommutative

eect, we consider the case of b  (  /2). we approximate this as
the smeared d1-brane background with f5 = h = 0. in this background, the

rr scalar induces an instability of the near-horizon geometry. however, it

turns out that the rr scalar is nonpropagating, while the dilaton is a phys-

ically propagating mode. we calculate the s-wave absorption cross section

of the dilaton. one nds 

0|b  ( r 

2

)8.9/5 in the leading-order while


0|b=0  (r0)8/5 in the d3-branes without b-eld. this means that al-
though the dilaton belongs to a minimally coupled scalar in the absence of

b-eld, it becomes a sort of xed scalar in the limit of b  .

i. introduction

recently noncommutative geometry has attracted much interest in studying on string

and m-theory in the b-eld [17]. for simplicity, we consider supergravity solutions which

are related to d3-branes with ns b eld. according to the ads/cft correspondence [8],

the near horizon geometry of d=7 black hole solution can describe the large n limit of

noncommutative super yang-mills theory (ncsym). we take a decoupling limit to isolate

the near horizon geometry from the remaining one. it turns out that the noncommutativ-

ity aects the ultra violet(uv) regime, leaving the infra red(ir) regime of the yang-mills

dynamics unchanged. the ncsym is thus not useful for studying the theory at short dis-

tances. it is well known that an ncsym with the noncommutativity scale  on a torus

of size  is equivalent to an ordinary supersymmetric yang-mills theory (osym) with a

magnetic ux provided that  = 2/2 is a rational number [9]. the equivalence between

the ncsym and the osym can be understood from the t-duality of the corresponding

string theory. hence the osym with b-eld is the proper description in the uv region,

while the ncsym takes over in the ir region. actually, the noncommutativity comes from

the b   limit of the ordinary theories [5,6,10].

we remind the reader that, aside the entropy, there exists an important dynamical quan-

tity, the greybody factor(absorption cross section) for the quantum black hole [1215]. on

the string side, there was a calculation for the absorption of scalars into the noncommutative

d3-branes [16]. however, the authors have not considered the rr sectors in ref. [16].

myung, kang, and lee [17]have studied the quantum aspect of the d3-brane black hole

in b23-eld background using a minimally coupled scalar. such minimally coupled eld

might describe uctuations of the o-diagonal gravitons polarized parallel to the brane

(hab, a, b = 0, 1, 2, 3). they derived the exact form of the absorption cross section(l) in

b-eld on the supergravity side. it is well known that the cross section can be extracted

from the solution to the linearized equation after the diagonalization.

it turns out that

b6=0
l

> b=0

l

. this implies that the presence of the b-eld suppresses the curvature eect

2

surrounding the d=7 black hole. as a result, it comes out the increase of greybody factor.

recently, kaya [18] has calculated the absorption cross section for the rr scalar in the

d3-brane with the large b-eld. he claimed that the greybody factor does not change even

if the b-eld is large. hence the rr scalar turns out to be a minimally coupled scalar with

b = 0 even for the presence of the large b-eld.

in this paper we study the propagations of the rr scalar() and the dilaton() by d3-

branes with b-eld along their world volume directions(x2, x3). especially we are interested

in the case of b  . here we use all information contained in the equations of motion,
the bianchi identities, and the gauge condition for graviton. in the absence of b-eld, such

elds as well as gravitons polarized parallel to the d3-brane belong to minimally coupled

scalars. however, in the presence of b-eld, these scalars are coupled to the background

nonminimally. in this sense, we may regard such elds as the xed scalars. actually, in

the smeared d1-brane background, the dilaton(rr scalar) turns out to be (non)propagating

modes. it is very important to test whether or not there is a change in the absorption cross

sections of the dilaton between b = 0 and b   cases.

the organization of this paper is as follows. in sec.ii, we briey review the eld equations

relevant for our study. here we study b   limit carefully and introduce the smeared
d1-brane black hole. sec.iii is devoted to analyzing the perturbations around the smeared

d1-brane background. the propagation of the rr scalar is investigated in sec.iv. this

induces an instability of the near-horizon geometry. sec.v deals with the propagation of the

dilaton with the dilaton gauge. in sec.vi, we study the propagation of the dilaton with the

harmonic gauge and obtain its absorption cross section. we discuss our results in sec.vii.

finally we present the smeared d1-brane solution in appendix a.

with the self-duality constraint f5 = f5 at the level of the equations of motion. the relevant

from now on we work in the string frame and thus neglect the subscript s. here the

asymptotic value of b-eld is b23 = tan  and the parameter r is dened by cos r4
0(=
4gn2). n is the number of the d3-branes and g = g is the string coupling constant.
it is obvious that for  = 0(h = 1) one recovers the ordinary d3-brane black hole with the
standard ads5s5 geometry in the near horizon. in this case we have f0123r = 1
its dual ( f 5), and e2  = g2.

g r(f1),

 = r4

for   /2(h  f ), however, one nds the d3-brane black hole in the very large
b-eld and thus the eect of noncommutativity appears. here one nds a deviation from
ads5s5 in the near horizon. however, it is known that in order to make connection to
noncommutative geometry,   
2 (b  ) limit must be carefully taken. in addition, we
need a double scaling limit of gn  , 42  0 to keep the expansion parameter 4r4
very small in the calculation of the absorption cross section. this implies the decoupling
limit of g  0,   0 : gn  1 and the low-energy limit(  0). here we wish to take
into account all of these limits only by taking   0 :

where b, g, n stay xed [5]. further this implies that

here one obtains a sequence of f01r  f0123r  hr23 in this limit. as a result, although
the ux of the rr ve-form( f5) counts the rank of the noncommutative gauge group, this
is very small in comparison with the rr three-form( f3) in the limit of   
2 (b  ).
hence we can neglect the eect of f5 and h on the absorption cross section in favor of f3.

in the case of f5 = h = 0, e2  = g2f , f01r = 1

g r(f1), one obtains the smeared d1-

brane solution in appendix a. we may regard this solution as the simple one to include

the noncommutative eect through r4

iii. perturbations

now let us introduce the perturbations to derive the greybody factor as [20]

f01r = f01r + f01r = f01r(1 + f3),

hr23 = hr23 + hr23 = hr23(1 + h3),

with

with all other perturbations to be zero. for the perturbations above, we keep the background

symmetry up to the linearized level. general uctuations give a complicated system of

to obtain all consistent linearized equations, we have to scale  in eqs.(26), (28) and (29) as

t . let us check the order of g in each equation.

gm p h with h = ht

/g. furthermore we nd from three bianchi identities in eq.(13) with eqs.(23)-(25) that

f3, f5  propagating modes,

h3  nonpropagating mode.

this means that the ns b-eld is considered as a tool for giving the noncommutative eect

but it does not belong to the physically propagating eld. for the graviton modes, we may

use either the dilaton gauge [21]

or the harmonic gauge [22]

m hm p = hm n p

m n

m hm p = 0.

(31)

(32)

although a choice of gauge condition does not eliminate all of the gauge freedom, it simplies

the perturbation equations. we note here that, although the equation (26) is a decoupled

one for the rr scalar(), eqs.(28) and (29) contain information for . kaya considered

7

eq.(26) only in ref. [18]. as can be seen the dilaton equation takes a very complicate form

coupled with various other elds. to decouple  from the remaining elds, we have to do

some further work. hence we separate the rr scalar from the dilaton. let us rst investigate

the rr scalar.

iv. rr scalar propagation

because of the rr scalar equation (26) is completely decoupled from others, we start with

an arbitrary b(). a way to obtain the noncommutative eect is to include the momentum

dependence along the world volume directions [5]. this is because the b23-eld is set up

along these directions. hence x2, x3 become noncommuting coordinates. now let us consider

the spacetime dependence

(t, x1, x2, x3, r, i) = eitei(k1x1+k2x2+k3x3)yl(1, 2,   , 5)l(r)

(33)

with 2
iyl(i) = l(l + 4)yl(i). yl(i) denotes spherical harmonics on s5 with unit radius.
here l(r) is the radial part of the l-partial wave of energy . then eq. (26) takes the form

the rst version of ref. [18].

if  = 0(b-eld is turned o) and l = 0, one nds that eq.(34) reduces to the s-wave

minimally coupled scalar() equation in the d=7 black hole background [12]

in order to transform eq. (34) into the familiar equation like eq. (37), we redene 0 as

fig. 1. the graphs of the rr scalar potential in the near horizon. for   /2, one nds a
potential well(dashed line) and for  = 0, one nds a potential barrier(solid line). the horizon is

located at r = 0.

for an arbitrary (b), it is very dicult to solve eq.(41). thus, let us discuss two interesting

cases. if   0, h  1. in this case, the last term of eq.(43) can be neglected, compared with
the rst one. then the rr scalar cross section takes the same form as that of the minimally
coupled scalar in eq. (37). for   
an important role in the near-horizon. in the near horizon, one nds that v n h

2 , h  f . in this case, the last term of eq.(43) plays
=0 = 15/4r2 for
= 1/4r2 for   /2. the latter case induces an instability of the near-
horizon geometry in the smeared d1-brane background because the potential well allows us

 = 0 and v n h

the scattering state( =real) as well as the exponentially growing state( = i). also the
same situation is recovered if one uses 2 = 0 instead of eq.(26). hence the instability
appears even for hm n p = 0. as is shown in fig.1, the singular behaviors of v=0, 
2 seem to
appear as r  0. however, this is a coordinate artifact. using the coordinate z in sec.vi,
instead of r, one cannot nd such singular behaviors in the near horizon.

v. dilaton propagation with the dilaton gauge

in this section, we wish to study the propagation of the dilaton with the dilaton gauge in

(31). under this gauge the dilaton equation takes a rather simple form than the harmonic

gauge [21]. assuming

(t, x1, x2, x3, r, i) = eitei(k1x1+k2x2+k3x3)yl(1, 2,   , 5)l(r),

(44)

the dilaton equation (27) leads to

(45)

our strategy is to disentangle the last three terms. for this purpose we have to use the

dilaton gauge condition (31) and the linearized equations for h, f3, f5 in eqs.(28)-(30).

because this is a nontrivial task for an arbitrary , we only consider a simple and physically
interesting case of   
2 (b  ). here one choose the smeared d1-brane background
with hm n p = fm n p qr = 0, which implies also that h3 = f5 = 0. then eq.(28) with this

gives us a constraint

(m ) f m p q = 0.

11

(46)

since f m p q 6= 0, eq.(46) implies  = 0. this means that  is a non-propagating mode in
the smeared d1-brane background. hence the instability problem of the rr scalar arisen

from the previous section is cured. the remaining ones are the s-wave dilaton equation and

if the last term is absent, eq.(51) reduces to the rr scalar equation (39) with  = 

2 . it is

easily proved that, considering (21) and (22) only, one nds that the dilaton equation (27)

leads to eq.(39). hence the presence of the last term is important to distinguish the dilaton

from the rr scalar. without b-eld, the xed scalar  is given by [14]

log v,

(52)

where v is the world volume measured in gm n . this implies that a trace of gravitons(ha

a)

polarized parallel in the world volume plays a role of the xed scalar. with b-eld, we

may assume a relation between the dilaton and ha

a. however, although we have a simple

dilaton equation with the dilaton gauge, one cannot determine the relation between  and

h2

2 + h3

3. this is so because we have no further information for h2

2 + h3

3. hence we also

have to use the einstein equation(a2) in the smeared d1-brane background of appendix a

using eq.(a2) and (a3), one obtains a scalar equation

r  4 ()2 + 42 = 0.

(53)

for an s-wave propagation, it is sucient to consider eq.(53) instead of eq.(a2). its lin-

earized equation takes the form

gm n rm n (h)  hm n rm n  8(cid:16) (cid:17)    4m n hm n

 4hm nmn   4 gm n p

m np  + 42 = 0

from eq.(55) we obtain

gm n rm n = 2h + pn hp n .

(54)

(55)

(56)

(57)

the last term in (57) with the dilaton gauge gives rise to a dicult relation for hm n to solve

eq. (54). hence we would be better to use the harmonic gauge condition (32) to obtain

gm n rm n = 

1
22h,

(58)

which is also recovered from eq.(56) with (32).

one nds a relation

which gives us a = 1/2. hence one obtains the correct dilaton equation as

eq.(65) for low energies (  0) and derive its absorption cross section. we divide the
space into three regions(i, ii, iii) and then match solutions in them together. in the near

horizon region(i) the equation takes the form

(67)

which is nothing but the standard bessel equation for

i(z) = h6(z). the above equation
can be interpreted as the schrodinger-like equation with the energy e = 1 which is valid for

large z(in the near horizon of r  0). the solution is given by

i(z) = z2h6(z).

in the intermediate zone(ii), the -term can be ignored. thus one nds the solution

vii. discussions

first we discuss the propagation of elds in the smeared d1-brane background of b 
i = 0, the dilaton , f3, and

r = hi

 limit. we have shown that, considering h = hr
2 + h3
h2

3 = h1

1  h2

2 = /2 are physically propagating modes whereas the rr scalar ,

h3, and f5, are non-propagating modes. interestingly, it turns out that the absorption cross
section of the dilaton in the limit of b   is given by the replacement of r0  r 
8  8.9 in eqs.(36) and (75). the r0  r 
couplings).

2 and
2 (8  8.9) arise from the presence of b-eld(the

the rr scalar has a negative potential as shown in fig.1. this induces an instability

of the near horizon in the smeared d1-brane background. fortunately, h-equation (28)

requires that this mode should not be a propagating one.

for a general analysis, let us consider the following equation with the parameter s upon

the diagonalization:

s

a

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b=0

hence we expect that the new scalars in the limit of b   may take a value of 4  s  32.
especially, the rr scalar with s = 4 is not allowed for matching procedure and thus it
cannot be a propagating mode. and the dilaton has s = 2 and its absorption cross section

is given by (75). for s = 0 case(minimally coupled scalar), one can recover (38) with  = 
2

from (77).

in conclusion, the b  (  

2 ) limit is a delicate issue. here for the calculation
of the absorption cross section, we take only the limit of   0. in this case one nds
h  , f3  1/, f5  nite. it is known that f5 counts the rank of the noncommutative
group. however, f5 6= 0 and h 6= 0 leads to the complicated coupled equations. solving
these coupled equations is a formidable task. we remind the reader that the uxes of f5

and h can be neglected in comparison with that of f3. hence we choose the simple smeared

d1-brane background by setting f5 = h = 0. at the rst sight, this action seems to be

eliminating any connection to noncommutative geometry. however, although we do not

count the uxes of f5 and h thoroughly, we still give the eect of the noncommutativity

on the absorption cross section through r4
/r4 and the important
coupling of f3. if h 6= 0 and f5 6= 0, we expect that there will be a change in s : r0  r 
2 ,
8  s(2  s < 32). this is so because the coupling scheme will change s.

0 in f = 1 + r4

finally we comment the ways to account the noncommutative eect on the cross section
0, k2 6= 0, and the couplings to

of the dilaton on the supergravity side. these are r4

( r4

0), the presence of

momenta along the world volume directions(k2, k3) to detect b23-eld, and the coupling of

f3 with h = f5 = 0. analysis for an arbitrary (b) remains unexplored.
