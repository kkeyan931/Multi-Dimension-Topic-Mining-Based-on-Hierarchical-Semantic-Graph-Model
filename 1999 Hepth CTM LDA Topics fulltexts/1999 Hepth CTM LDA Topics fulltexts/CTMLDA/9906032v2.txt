abstract

in the london limit of the ginzburg-landau theory (abelian higgs model), vortex dipoles
(small vortex loops) are treated as a grand canonical ensemble in the dilute gas approximation. the
summation over these objects with the most general rotation- and translation invariant measure
of integration over their shapes leads to eective sine-gordon theories of the dual elds. the
representations of the partition functions of both grand canonical ensembles are derived in the
form of the integrals over the vortex dipoles and the small vortex loops, respectively. by virtue
of these representations, the bilocal correlator of the vortex dipoles (loops) is calculated in the
low-energy limit.

it is further demonstrated that once the vortex dipoles (loops) are considered as such an
ensemble rather than individual ones, the london limit of the ginzburg-landau theory (abelian
higgs model) with external monopoles is equivalent up to the leading order in the inverse uv cuto
to the compact qed in the corresponding dimension with the charge of cooper pairs changed
due to the debye screening.

1 introduction

it is commonly argued that abrikosov vortices [1] (nielsen-olesen strings [2]) in the dual ginzburg-
landau theory (abelian higgs model) reveal the properties similar to those of strings in 3d- and
4d qcd, respectively. this observation is based on the so-called t hooft-mandelstam scenario
of connement [3], according to which connement in qcd can be macroscopically thought of as
the dual meissner eect. once being put forward, such a correspondence then enabled one to de-
velop various phenomenological models of connement, e.g. the so-called dual qcd approach [4].
however, an extremely strong support has been given to the t hooft-mandelstam scenario by the
so-called abelian projection method [5] (see e.g. refs. [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] for recent devel-
opments and ref. [15] for a review). the main outcome of this method is that under certain quite
pleasurable assumptions (like the so-called abelian dominance hypothesis [16, 8]), su(2)-qcd
can indeed be with a good accuracy viewed as the london limit of the dual abelian higgs model
with external electrically charged particles. an independent support of this conclusion comes out
from the evaluation of eld correlators in the dual abelian higgs model and comparison of them
with those in qcd, introduced within the so-called stochastic vacuum model [17] and measured in
the lattice experiments in ref. [18]. this calculation has been performed in refs. [19, 20, 21], and
as a result a very good agreement between the two sets of correlators has been established 1. all
that encourages one to work further on investigating the conning properties of the abelian higgs
model, which is a good and simple example of a model exhibiting the property of connement.
this is the main motivation for the present research.

in a variety of an existing literature on the abelian higgs model from the point of view of
the abelian projection method (see e.g. refs. [22, 23, 21]), the interaction of the nielsen-olesen
strings has not been studied. in this respect, string representations of various objects (like partition
function or eld correlators) obtained there are insensitive to the properties of the ensemble of
strings as a whole and depend actually on a single string only 2. apart from that, there exist some
publications where vortices in the 2d- and 3d ginzburg-landau theory have been treated as a
grand canonical ensemble of dipoles [25, 26]. the results of these investigations are as follows. in
the 2d case [25], the eective eld theory, emerging after the summation over the vortex dipoles,
is the sine-gordon one with the action of the type 3

s2d

gl = z d2xh()2 + m22  2 cos i .

(1)

here, m stands for the gauge boson mass, and  is the so-called fugacity of dimension (mass)2,
which is the statistical weight (boltzmann factor) of a single vortex dipole. as far as the 3d
case [26] is concerned, there the resulting eective eld theory is again the ginzburg-landau type
theory of magnetic higgs eld (albeit with an additional mass term of the dual vector eld h),
whose partition function has the form

1a similar calculation of eld correlators in the abelian-projected su (3)-gluodynamics has been performed in

ref. [12].

2an obvious generalization of the string representation for the partition function of the theory with a global

u (1)-symmetry to an ensemble of noninteracting strings has been performed in ref. [24].

3throughout the present paper, we work in the euclidean space-time.

although both the free part of the world-line action standing in the exponent on the r.h.s. of
eq. (3) and the -type interaction are quite natural, it looks desirable to perform the summation
over the grand canonical ensemble of the vortex dipoles with the most general rotation- and
translation invariant integration measure without specication of its concrete form. clearly, such
an approach would then enable one to perform also the summation over the grand canonical
ensemble of the small vortex loops, built out of the nielsen-olesen strings in the abelian higgs
model. notice that the summation over the vortex loops seems to be dicult to perform by
a direct generalization of eq. (3), since the string world-sheet is a 2d object, rather than a
1d vortex line. it is our aim in the present paper to proceed with such a summation over the
small vortex loops in the abelian higgs model. as far as the summation over the vortex dipoles
in the ginzburg-landau theory is concerned, it turns out to be analogous to the summation
over the grand canonical ensemble of magnetic loops emerging in the abelian-projected su(2)-
gluodynamics [14]. in both cases of the ginzburg-landau theory and abelian higgs model, the
eective eld theories resulting from the summation occur to be of the sine-gordon type (1). they
allow for the representations directly in terms of the integrals over the vortex dipoles (loops). as
we shall see, besides the biot-savart type interaction of the objects under study, the eective
actions, corresponding to these representations, contain a multivalued potential resulting from
the cosine interaction. in the low-energy limit, the real branch of this potential takes a simple
quadratic form, and the integration over the vortex dipoles (loops) becomes simply gaussian.
this will enable us to calculate exactly the bilocal correlation functions of the vortex dipoles and
small vortex loops in this limit. after that, we shall investigate the eects brought about by
such a way of summation over the grand canonical ensemble of the vortex dipoles (loops) to the
ginzburg-landau theory (abelian higgs model) with external monopoles. in particular, it will
be demonstrated that to the leading order in the inverse uv momentum cuto, this method of
summation leads to an equivalence of the so-extended ginzburg-landau theory (abelian higgs
model) to the compact qed in the corresponding dimension.

the paper is organized as follows. in the next section, we start our analysis with the ginzburg-
landau theory and then apply the so-developed techniques in section 3 to the abelian higgs
model. the main results of the paper are summarized in conclusions. finally in three appendices,
some technical details of the performed calculations are outlined.

2 grand canonical ensemble of the vortex dipoles in the

ginzburg-landau theory

let us consider the partition function of the 3d ginzburg-landau theory in the london limit,
i.e., the limit of innitely heavy higgs eld,

gl = z dadsing.dreg. exp(z d3x" 1

(4)

where from now on (both in the case of the ginzburg-landau theory and abelian higgs model)
we adopt the notations of refs. [24, 22, 8, 19, 23, 12, 21, 13]. here, f = a  a is the eld
strength tensor of the vector potential a, and  = sing. + reg. stands for the phase of the higgs
eld, consisting of a singular and a regular parts. first of them describes a certain conguration
of abrikosov vortices (e.g., a single vortex) according to the equation

sing.(x) = 2(x).

(5)

here, (x)  h dx( )(x  x( )) is the -function dened w.r.t. the vortex line parametrized
by the vector x( ), 0    1. the vortex lines are closed, which is expressed by the equation
 = 0. notice that eq. (5) is nothing else but the local form of the stokes theorem. as far as
the usual regular part of the phase of the higgs eld is concerned, it describes uctuations above
this vortex background.

one can perform the so-called path-integral duality transformation (see the above mentioned
refs.), which eventually casts the partition function (4) into the form of the integrals over the
dual magnetic eld h and vortex lines. referring the reader for details to the above cited papers,
we present here the nal result of this transformation, which has the form

(6)

notice that all the manipulations with eq. (6), which will be performed below, should obviously
be done at the saddle-point for the eld h, where due to the closeness of vortices, the second proca
equation, h = 0, holds.

one can now sum up over the vortex dipoles in eq. (6) in the sense of eq. (3), which leads to
eq. (2). our aim here is, however, to perform such a summation not specifying the measure to the

4

particular form of the r.h.s. of eq. (3), but rather keeping it as the most general rotation- and
translation invariant one. to start with, we shall consider partition function (6) as a contribution
of n vortex dipoles to their grand canonical ensemble. this can be done by replacing  in eq. (6)
by the following expression describing the density of the gas of the vortex dipoles

gas

(7)

here, nas stand for winding numbers, and we have decomposed the vector xa( ) as follows,

1

r0

xa( ) = ya + za( ), where ya =
d xa( ) denotes the position of the a-th vortex dipole. in what
follows, we shall restrict ourselves to the minimal values of winding numbers, na = 1, which
is just the essence of the dipole approximation. that is because the energy of a single vortex is
known to be a quadratic function of the ux [1], due to which the existence of a dipole made out
of two vortices of a unit ux is more energetically favorable than the existence of one vortex of the
double ux. besides that, we shall work in the approximation of a dilute gas of the vortex dipoles.
d z2, which we
according to this approximation, characteristic sizes of the vortex dipoles,
shall denote by a, are much smaller than characteristic distances |y| between them, which we
shall denote by l. in particular, this means that the vortex dipoles are short living objects.
within these two approximations, by substituting eq. (7) into eq. (6) one can proceed with
the summation over the grand canonical ensemble of the vortex dipoles. this procedure essentially
parallels a similar one of ref. [14], and its details are outlined in appendix a. as a result, we
arrive at the following expression for the grand canonical partition function

(8)

here,   es0 is the so-called fugacity, which has the dimension (mass)3 with s0 standing for the
action of a single vortex dipole, and  is the uv momentum cuto. thus, the summation over
the grand canonical ensemble of the dipoles, built out of abrikosov vortices, with the most general
form of the measure of integration over their shapes yields in the dilute gas approximation the
eective sine-gordon theory (8). in particular, this way of treating the gas of the vortex dipoles
leads to increasing the mass of the dual eld h. namely, expanding the cosine in eq. (8) we get
the square of the full mass, m 2 = m2 + m2
d  q22, where m = q is the usual mass of the
2 is the additional contribution
dual eld (equal to the mass of the gauge boson), and md = 
coming from the debye screening. we have also introduced the full electric charge q = qq2 + 2
2 .
our next aim is to derive the representation of the partition function (8) directly in the form
of an integral over the vortex dipoles. this can be done by making use of the following equality
(valid at the saddle-point of the eld h, corresponding to the action standing in the exponent on
the r.h.s. of eq. (6)),

substituting it into eq. (8), one can straightforwardly resolve the resulting saddle-point equation
for the eld h, h

the obtained representation (9) can now be applied to the calculation of correlators of the
vortex dipoles. indeed, it is possible to demonstrate that if we introduce into eq. (6) (with 
replaced by gas

 ) a unity of the form

1 = z dj(cid:16)j  gas

 (cid:17) = z djdl exp(cid:20)2iz d3xl(cid:16)j  gas
 (cid:17)(cid:21)

and integrate out all the elds except j, the result will coincide with eq. (9). this is the reason why
the correlators of js are nothing else, but the correlators of the vortex dipoles. such correlators
can be calculated in the low-energy limit, i.e., when |j|   and one considers in eq. (10) the
stable minimum of the real branch of the potential by extracting from the whole sum the term
with n = 0. in this case, the bilocal correlator of the vortex dipoles reads

this example illustrates how the vortex dipoles in the grand canonical ensemble are correlated to
each other. in particular, we see that their correlator decreases exactly according to the yukawa
law with the screening provided by the full mass m.

let us now see what will be the consequences of accounting for interaction of the vortex
dipoles in the grand canonical ensemble if we introduce into the ginzburg-landau theory external
monopoles. to start with, we shall introduce the monopoles into the ginzburg-landau theory
with noninteracting abrikosov vortices. this can be done by replacing the eld strength tensor
f in eq. (4) by f + f m
 obeys the equation
1
2 f m
 = 2 with  standing for the density of monopoles. the path-integral duality
transformation of the so-extended theory (4) has been performed in ref. [13] and eectively
results to adding to the lagrangian standing in the exponent on the r.h.s. of eq. (6) the term

we are now in the position to investigate what will be the eect of summation over the grand

the expansion of the cosine only the term quadratic in h, than the integration over h is gaussian,
and the result has the form

the details of a derivation of eq. (13) are presented in appendix b. this equation means that in
the physical limit, when the uv momentum cuto innitely increases, the partition function of
the ginzburg-landau theory with external monopoles, where the vortex dipoles are summed up
in the sense of the grand canonical ensemble, is equivalent to the statistical weight of 3d compact
qed with the charge q of cooper pairs replaced by the full one q.

finally, it is worth noting that accounting for all the terms in the 1

rather than only for the leading one, leads simply to the following substitution in eq. (9)

3 grand canonical ensemble of the small vortex loops

in the abelian higgs model

in the present section, we shall extend the analysis of the grand canonical ensemble of the vortex
dipoles to the 4d case of the small vortex loops, built out of nielsen-olesen strings, in the london
limit of the abelian higgs model. the partition function under study is given by eq. (4) with
the replacement d3x  d4x. notice that in what follows, we shall mark the 4d quantities (e.g.,
charge of cooper pairs, v.e.v. of the higgs eld, etc.) by prime in order to distinguish them from
the corresponding 3d ones. equation (5) goes over into [24, 22, 8, 19, 23, 13]

sing.(x) = 2(x),

d(x())(x  x()) is the so-called vorticity tensor current dened at the

string world-sheet , parametrized by the vector x(). here,  = (1, 2)  [0, 1]  [0, 1] denotes
the 2d coordinate, and d(x()) stands for the innitesimal world-sheet element. due to the
closeness of strings, the vorticity tensor current is conserved, i.e.,  = 0.

the path-integral duality transformation of the abelian higgs model accounting for noninter-
acting nielsen-olesen strings has been performed in the above mentioned papers, and the result
reads

zahm =

= z dx()dhdb exp

here, h  h + h + h stands for the eld strength tensor of the massive antisym-
metric tensor eld h, usually referred to as the kalb-ramond eld [27]. analogously to the

in order to proceed from the individual string to the gas of the small vortex loops, one should

after that, the summation over the grand canonical ensemble of the vortex loops is straightfor-

the representation of the partition function (16) in terms of the vortex loops can be obtained

where k1 stands for the modied bessel function. substituting this equality into eq. (16), we can
integrate the eld h out, which yields the desired representation for the partition function (16),

grand = z ds exp(" q3

(17)

where the eective potential v is given by eq. (10) with d3x  d4x.
similarly to the 3d case, correlation functions of ss, calculated by virtue of the partition
function (17), are nothing else, but the correlation functions of the small vortex loops in the gas.
this can be seen by mentioning that if we insert into eq. (14) with  replaced by gas
 the
following unity

1 = z ds(cid:16)s  gas

 (cid:17) = z dsdl exp(cid:20)iz d4xl (cid:16)s  gas
 (cid:17)(cid:21)

8

and integrate out all the elds except s, the result will coincide with eq. (17). such correlation
functions of the small vortex loops can be most easily calculated in the low-energy limit, 2 |s| 
, by considering the stable minimum of the real branch of the potential (10), where it takes a
simple parabolic form. in particular, the bilocal correlation function reads (cf. eq. (11))

thus, we see that if nielsen-olesen strings are considered not as individual ones, but as a gas of
the small vortex loops, the interaction between which has the yukawa form, the bilocal correlator
of the vortex loops in the low-energy limit has also the yukawa behaviour (albeit screened not by
the mass of the gauge boson, but by the full mass m).

let us now investigate grand canonical ensemble of the vortex loops in the presence of external
monopoles. to start with, we rst clarify what will be the modications of the abelian higgs
model with nielsen-olesen strings treated as individual ones due to external monopoles. the
starting partition function has the form

with j standing for the (conserved) monopole current. the path-integral duality transformation
of the partition function (18) has been performed in ref. [21] and leads to eq. (14) with the
substitution      + 1
it is now straightforward to see what will be the consequences of the summation over the grand
canonical ensemble of the small vortex loops to the abelian higgs model with external monopoles.
namely, this summation leads to the following expression for the partition function:

the derivation of eq. (21) is similar to that of eq. (13). the only technical detail necessary for it
is the integration over the kalb-ramond eld, which can be found in refs. [28, 21].

thus we see that similarly to the 3d case, in this physical limit, the partition function of the
grand canonical ensemble of the small vortex loops extended by external monopoles is equivalent
to the statistical weight of the 4d compact qed with the electric charge q replaced by the full
one q.

finally, accounting for all the orders in the 1/-expansion in eq. (20) is equivalent to the

following substitution in eq. (17):

v [s]  v (cid:20)(cid:18)s 

this means that external monopoles do not aect the yukawa-type interaction of the vortex loops,
but enter only their eective potential.

4 conclusions

in the present paper, we have investigated grand canonical ensembles of the vortex dipoles and
small vortex loops in the london limit of the ginzburg-landau theory and abelian higgs model,
respectively.
in the approximation where these objects form a dilute gas, the summation over
them with the most general rotation- and translation invariant measure of integration over their
shapes has been performed. the resulting eective theories turned out to have the form of the
sine-gordon theories due to the additional cosine interaction term of the dual eld, emerging from
the above mentioned summation. in the physical limit of the large uv momentum cuto, one can
keep in the expansion of this cosine interaction in powers of the inverse cuto only the rst term.
this yields a certain (positive) correction to the mass of the dual eld due to the debye screening.
after that, we have casted the obtained sine-gordon theories, corresponding to the ginzburg-
landau theory and abelian higgs model, into the forms of the representations in terms of the
vortex dipoles and small vortex loops, respectively. the resulting eective actions turned out to
have similar forms and consist of the biot-savart yukawa type interaction of the objects under
study and a certain multivalued eective potential. in the low-energy limit, this potential takes a
simple quadratic form, and the eective actions become gaussian. this enables one to calculate
correlation functions of the vortex dipoles (loops) in this limit, and as an example, we have
calculated the bilocal correlators. those turned out to have the yukawa form, where the screening
is governed by the full mass of the dual eld, resulting both from the higgs and debye eects.

then, we have addressed the problem of what will be the consequences of our approach to
treatment the vortex dipoles (loops) as a grand canonical ensemble to the theories under study
extended by external monopoles. in this way, we have demonstrated that to the leading order
in the expansion in powers of the inverse momentum cuto, summation over the grand canonical
ensemble results to the complete equivalence of these theories to the compact qed in the corre-
sponding dimension with the charge of cooper pairs replaced by the full one (which accounts also
for the debye screening). this result diers from that, which one gets by considering abrikosov
vortices (nielsen-olesen strings) as individual ones. in that case, the equivalence to compact qed
holds only in the limit of vanishing gauge boson mass. as far as the eects brought about by
external monopoles to all the orders of the expansion in the inverse powers of the uv momentum
cuto are concerned, those result into certain shifts of the arguments of the eective potentials,
but do not aect the biot-savart interaction.

10

it now looks attractive to investigate the grand canonical ensembles of the vortex dipoles
(loops) emerging in the eective abelian-projected theories, corresponding to the original su(n),
n > 2, yang-mills theories, since the dual abelian higgs model can be under some assumptions
considered as such an eective theory for the case n = 2. recently, some progress in this direction
has been achieved in ref. [30].

appendix a. summation over the grand canonical ensem-
ble of the vortex dipoles

in this appendix, we shall present some details of a derivation of eq. (8) of the main text. sub-
stituting eq. (7) into eq. (6), one can perform the summation over the grand canonical ensemble
of the vortex dipoles as follows:

here, we have introduced the so-called fugacity , which is proportional to the statistical weight of
a single vortex dipole and has the dimension (mass)3. next, [z] stands for a certain rotation- and
translation invariant measure of integration over the shapes of dipoles. let us now employ for the
grand canonical ensemble of the vortex dipoles under consideration the dilute gas approximation
described after eq. (7). one can then expand h(x) up to the rst order in a/l as follows:

h(x) = h(y) + l1znh(y) + o (cid:18) a

l(cid:19)2! ,

(a.1)

where n = y/|y|, and we have substituted n/l for the derivative /y. by making use of this
expansion, we obtain

2 (  ). notice that
the sum in square brackets on the r.h.s. of the last equality contains (2n1)!! terms, which is the
reason for extracting explicitly this normalization factor. the general form of the tensor structure
standing in these brackets is due to the rotation- and translation invariance of the measure [z].
in the further contraction of indices, it is worth noting that within the dilute gas approximation,
indeed, as we have already seen, this approximation allows for the substitution
nh(y) = 0.
n  l 
. on the other hand, the divergency of the eld h vanishes according to the second
proca equation, valid at the saddle point of the eld h corresponding to eq. (6). this completes
the proof of our statement.

finally, introducing the uv momentum cuto as  = l2a2 ( a1), we obtain

which leads to eq. (8).

appendix b. details of a derivation of eq. (13)

which (up to an inessential constant factor, which can be referred to the integration measure)
is the leading term in the 1

part (12). gaussian integration over the eld h yields

j = exp(

(b.1)

where the normalization factor was assumed to be included into the measure dh.
let us consider the rst term in square brackets on the r.h.s. of eq. (b.1) together with the
factor in front of these brackets. by performing the partial integration, one can cast the derivative
/y to the factor in front of the brackets, after which due to the translation invariance of this
factor it can be replaced by /x. this derivative can be casted back by doing one more partial
integration, which yields for this group of terms

in legendre

from the whole series only the zeroth term,
pn(cos )d cos  = 2n0. after that, the integration
over |y| at both intervals is straightforward and yields for the integral (b.3) the following result:

appendix c. summation over the grand canonical ensem-
ble of the small vortex loops

in the present appendix, we shall outline some steps of a derivation of eq. (16). let us rst
consider the innitesimal world-sheet element of the a-th vortex loop, which has the form

d (xa()) = (xa

())(xa

())d2,

where ,  = 1, 2. analogously to the 3d case, it is reasonable to introduce the center-of-mass
coordinate (position) of the world-sheet ya
(). the full world-sheet coordinate can be
respectively decomposed as follows xa
() describing the shape
of the a-th vortex loop world-sheet. then, substituting into eq. (14) instead of  the vorticity
tensor current of the vortex loop gas (15), we can perform the summation over the grand canonical
ensemble of the vortex loops as follows:

  r d2xa

here,  is a certain rotation- and translation invariant measure of integration over shapes of the
world-sheets of the vortex loops . employing now the dilute gas approximation, we can expand
h up to the rst order in a/l (cf. eq. (a.1)), where a stands for the typical value of |za()|s
(vortex loops sizes), which are much smaller than the typical value l of |ya|s (distances between
vortex loops) 4. this yields

z dz()[z] cos(cid:18)z d(z())h(x())(cid:19)  z dz[z] cos(cid:18)

ance of the measure [z], the last average has the form
