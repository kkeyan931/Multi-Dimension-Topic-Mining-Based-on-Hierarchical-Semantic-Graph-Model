(in presence symmetry breaking boundary conditions, analysis rened, see .) moreover, boundary operator typically changes boundary condition; therefore carries two additional labels , indicate two conformally invariant boundary conditions two segments adjacent boundary insertion. boundary operators therefore often written (x). but, fact, still sucient, general. reason eld-state correspondence requires associate every state contributes partition function (t) = x ( 2 ) (3.1) annulus boundary conditions separate boundary eld. symmetry preserving boundary conditions, annulus coecients known  3 coincide fusion rule coecients: = n . (3.2) fusion rules n not, general, zero one; consequence one must introduce another degeneracy label a, taking values {1, 2, ... , n+} . complete labelling boundary operators therefore looks like (x) . (3.3) remark passing complicated situations, like e.g. symmetry breaking bound- ary conditions  non-trivial modular invariants , degeneracy spaces relevant boundary operators still admit representation theoretic interpretation involves appropri- ate (sub-)bundles chiral blocks. boundary elds satisfy operator product expansion schematically reads (x) b (y) x n xl=1 n xc=1 c b c l  , (3.4) l {1, 2, ... , n } labels basis space chiral couplings . turns every (rational) conformal eld theory, structure constants c b c l 2 wzw models, actually also interested horizontal descendants, conformal weight primary eld. regarded pair consisting highest weight relevant actual g-weight. correspondingly, operator product (3.4) one must addition include appropriate clebsch--gordan coecients g. 3 compare also {$9904145$} arguments lagrangian setting. 10 appearing nothing suitable entries fusing matrices f: c b c l = (flc,a+ b) .

(3.11) h (3.12) furthermore, invariance maximal torus picks weight space weight zero. thus nd mult() 0 f (g/t ) = mp isomorphism g-modules, mult() multiplicity weight = 0 0 irreducible module h highest weight . thus, particular, modules belonging trivial conjugacy class g-modules appear decomposition (3.12). recall boundary operators organised terms modules h ane lie algebra g. aim show algebra boundary elds correspond states lowest grade modules h, i.e. either primary elds horizontal descendants, 5 carries left g-module structure limit innite level coincides decomposition (3.12). restricting nite subspace fk boundary operators, via eld-state correspon- dence annulus amplitudes tell us fk carries structure g-module, g-module isomorphic direct sum fk = m,pk h (3.13) irreducible g-modules. thus able perform quantitative analysis alge- bra boundary operators, need control values annulus coecients . since according identity (3.2), long bulk symmetries preserved, numbers coincide fusion rules coecients, = n+, interested concrete ex- pressions fusion rules. turns expressed suitable weight multiplicities following convenient form: n+ = 1 |w | xw1,w2w (w1) (w2) xl mult() w1(+)+w2(+)(k+g) .

(3.19) (3.20) space indeed nothing f (g/t ) appearing (3.12). result indicates particular algebra boundary operators change boundary condition related space functions brane world volume. regarded empirical evidence statement obvious itself, since general non-trivial vector bundles brane appear chan--paton bundles, boundary operators might well related sections non-trivial bundles rather functions. 14 summary, limit innite level boundary operators belong states nite-dimensional subspace h h lowest conformal weight furnish g-module isomorphic algebra f (g/t ) functions regular conjugacy class, seen g-module. far considered spaces interest g-modules. would like equip f (g) space boundary operators also algebra structure. operator product algebra boundary operators, whose structure constants are, seen, fusing matrices, obeys certain associativity properties. properties immediately related ordinary associativity, denition operator product involves limiting procedure. several proposals made recently relation operator product algebra boundary operators algebra f (g/t ). approach based deformation quantization proposed {$9904145$}. denition product involves xing insertion points two boundary elds prescribed positions parameter space. theory question topological, one thus forced introduce arbitrary non-intrinsic data contrast situation topological theories studied . another proposal  starts restriction operator product algebra elds correspond states lowest conformal weight ane irreducible modules. destroys associativity. prescription  also allows open strings end points one brane. dicult reconcile fact (compare formula (3.19) above) open strings connecting dierent branes ignored limit innite level. 4 symmetry breaking boundary conditions turn boundary conditions wzw models break part bulk symmetries. one important class consistent boundary conditions constructed prescribing automorphism chiral algebra connects left movers right movers presence boundary. case boundary condition said automorphism type . point out, however, also boundary conditions known automorphism exists. wzw example provided so(5) level 1; example, conformal embedding subalgebra isomorphic sl(2) level 10, one classify boundary conditions (see ) preserve sl(2) symmetries. however, general theory boundary conditions without automorphism type developped far, consider present paper. every boundary condition preserves subalgebra full chiral algebra a; conformal invariance, contains virasoro subalgebra a. boundary conditions possess automorphism type , preserved subalgebra characterized orbifold subalgebra, namely algebra = a<> consisting elements xed . theory treating boundary conditions arbitrary conformal eld theories developped . case interest us, relevant automorphisms chiral algebra induced automorphisms horizontal subalgebra g untwisted ane lie algebra g preserve compact real form g. via construction (1.4) ane lie algebras centrally extended loop algebras, every automorphism extends uniquely 15 automorphism g. slight abuse notation denote automorphism , too. briey summarize results derive section. way symmetry preserving boundary conditions localized regular conjugacy classes, boundary conditions automorphism type localized submanifolds g(h) := {gh(g)1 | g g} , c (4.1) refer twined conjugacy classes, h g form (2.7). 6 case sl(2) or, generally, whenever inner automorphism g, twined conjugacy classes tilted versions ordinary conjugacy classes. precisely, obtained ordinary conjugacy classes right translation, cads g (h) = cg(hs) s1. 0 , 0 case outer automorphisms, dimension twined conjugacy classes diers dimension ordinary ones. ordinary regular conjugacy classes isomorphic homogeneous space g/t , twined conjugacy classes outer automorphisms turn isomorphic g/t subtorus maximal torus . instance, g = sl(3) dimension regular conjugacy classes dim(g/t ) = 82 = 6, outer automorphisms twined conjugacy classes dimension dim(g/t 0 ) = 81 = 7. increase dimension actually generalizes well-known eect free conformal eld theories, automorphisms outer, non-abelian case. namely, d-dimensional background relevant automorphism, element o(d), determines dimension brane constant eld strength it. particular, non-trivial automorphisms change dimension brane. boundary states b built twisted boundary blocks b generalized symmetry breaking boundary conditions automorphism type . latter, ward identities (2.2) get (cid:0)j b n 1 + 1 (j n)(cid:1) = 0 .
