1 introduction

the central aspect of this work is the construction of the s-matrix by means
of causality in the quantum eld theoretical (qft) framework. this idea
goes back to stuckelberg, bogoliubov and shirkov and the program was car-
ried out correctly by epstein and glaser [1] for scalar eld theory and subse-
quently applied to qed by scharf [2] and to non-abelian gauge theories by
dutsch et al. [3, 4]. we now apply this scheme to quantum gravity (qg),
i.e. a qft of self-interacting massless spin-2 quantum gauge elds on at
space-time. for this purpose, two main tools will be used: the epstein-glaser
inductive construction of the perturbation series for the s-matrix with the
related causal renormalization scheme and perturbative quantum gauge in-
variance [3, 4]. the rst method provides an elegant way of dealing with
the uv problem of qg and the second one ensures gauge invariance at the
quantum level, formulated by means of the gauge charge q, in each order
of perturbation theory. a detailed exposition will be found in forthcoming
papers by the author.

2 causal perturbation theory

we consider the s-matrix, a formal power series in the coupling constant, as
a sum of smeared operator-valued distributions of the following form [1]:

s(g) = 1 +



xn=1z d4x1 . . . d4xn tn(x1, . . . , xn) g(x1)  . . .  g(xn),

(1)

where g is a schwartz test function which plays the role of adiabatic switching
of the interaction and provides a natural infrared cut o in the long-range part
of the interaction. the tn, n-point operator-valued distributions, are well-
dened renormalized time-ordered products and can be expressed in term
of wick monomials of free elds. they are constructed inductively from the
rst order t1(x), which denes the theory, by means of poincare covariance
and causality; the latter, if correctly incorporated, leads directly to the nite
perturbation series for the s-matrix. the construction of tn requires some
care:
if it were simply given by the usual time-orderig tn(x1, . . . , xn) =
t{t1(x1) . . . t1(xn)}, then uv-divergences would appear. if the arguments
x1, . . . , xn are all time-ordered, i.e. if we have x0
n, then tn
is rigorously given by tn(x1, . . . , xn) = t1(x1) . . . t1(xn); since tn is totally

2 > . . . > x0

1 > x0

1

symmetric in x1, . . . , xn, we obtain tn everywhere except for the complete
diagonal n = {x1 = x2 = . . . = xn}. after performing wick expansion of
tn, we can extend the c-number distributions from r4n \ n to r4n, so that
we obtain
tn(x1, . . . , xn) = pk : ok(x1, . . . , xn) : tk
n(x1, . . . , xn) = tk
tk

n(x1, . . . , xn) + sum of free local normalization terms

n(x1, . . . , xn),

(2)
where : ok(x1, . . . , xn) : represents a normally ordered product of free eld
operators and tk
n(x1, . . . , xn) a well-dened c-number distribution which is
not unique: it is ambiguous up to distributions with local support n which
depend on the power counting degree of the distribution. this normalization
freedom has to be restricted by further physical conditions. in momentum
space, tk
n(x1, . . . , xn) is best obtained by means of dispersion-like integrals [2]
which correspond to the splitting of causal distributions into retarded and
advanced parts with respect to the last argument xn (see sec. 5).

3 quantization of gravity

for the causal construction we need the equation of motion of the free gravi-
ton after xing the gauge, the commutation relation between free elds at
dierent space-time points and the rst-order graviton self-coupling t h
1 (x).
since we are interested in a quantum theory of einsteins general relativity,
we therefore start from the hilbert-einstein lagrangian density lhe writ-
ten in terms of the goldberg variable g = gg and by expanding it
into a power series in the coupling constant  = 32g, by introducing the
graviton eld h dened through h = g  , where  is the at
space-time metric tensor:

lhe = 2

2 gr =



xj=0

jl(j)
he;

(3)

and l(j)
he represents an interaction involving j + 2 gravitons. from this for-
mulation of general relativity we extract the ingredients for the perturbative
construction of causal qg. we stress however the fact that we consider the
classical lagrangian density eq. (3) only as a source of information about

2

the elds, the couplings and the gauge which we work with: causal pertur-
bation theory doesnt rely on any quantum lagrangian. by considering the
euler-lagrange variation of l(0)
, = 0
we obtain the equation of motion for the free graviton eld h(x) = 0,
and quantize it covariantly by imposing the commutation rule

he from eq. (3) in the hilbert-gauge h

}
|

{z

b

d0(x  y),

(4)

where d0(x) is the jordan-pauli causal distribution. the rst order coupling
among gravitons, being linear in the coupling constant , can be derived from
eq. (3) by taking the normally ordered

product of l(1)
he :

t h
1 (x) = i : l(1)

he(x) := i



2 (cid:8): h(x)h(x),h(x), : . . .(cid:9) .

4 perturbative quantum gauge invariance

the classical gauge transformations h  h + u, + u,  u
, can
be quantum mechanically implemented in the following way by means of the
gauge charge q:

h(x) = eiqh(x)e+iq,

d3x h(x),


x
0 u(x),

q = rx0=t

(6)

which leads to the innitesimal gauge variation of the asymptotic free gravi-
ton eld

dqh(x) = (cid:2)q, h(x)(cid:3) = ibu(x),

where u are c-number elds satisfying u(x) = 0. s-matrix gauge in-
variance: limg1(s(g)  s(g)) = limg1 (i [q, s(g)] + higher com.) = 0 is
reached, if we can show that the perturbative quantum gauge invariance 
condition [3, 5]

(7)

dqtn(x1, . . . , xn) = [q, tn(x1, . . . , xn)] = divergence

(8)

3

holds true for all n  1. already for n = 1, eq.
dqt h
u and u, coupled to the graviton eld through the ghost coupling [5]

(8) is non-trivial, because
1 (x) 6= div; this requires the introduction of ghost and antighost elds,

t u
1 = i (: u(x),h(x),u(x) : + . . .) ,

(9)

and quantized as free fermionic vector elds {u(x), u(y)} = id0(x  y)
with innitesimal gauge variations dqu(x) = 0 and dqu(x) = ih(x),, so
that we obtain

dq(cid:0)t h

1 (x) + t u

1 (x)(cid:1) = x

 t 

1/1(x) = divergence.

(10)

the fermionic quantization is also necessary to have q nilpotent, q2 = 0.
the ghost elds, usually called faddeev-popov ghosts, are introduced in the
causal construction as a consequence of perturbative gauge invariance eq. (8)
for n = 1. in the path-integral framework, the ghost elds appears as a by-
product of the quantization after gauge xing, but it was already noticed by
feynman [6] that without ghost elds a unitarity breakdown occurs in 2nd
order at the loop level.

5 pure quantum gravity in 2nd order

we now investigate the graviton self-energy contribution (graviton and ghost
loops) in 2nd order. the inductive construction of t2(x1, x2) can be accom-
plished in two steps: rst we construct the following causal distribution from
eq. (4), (5) and (9) and apply wick expansion

1

(x1), t h+u

1

dse

2 (x1, x2) = [t h+u

(x2)]|se =: h(x1)h(x2) : d2(x1  x2),
(11)
because of translation invariance the c-number distribution d2 depends only
on the relative coordinate x = x1  x2. in momentum space we get for the
self-energy tensor-valued distribution

d2(p) = p (4)(p)(p2) sgn(p0)

(12)

where p (4)(p) is a covariant polynomial of degree 4. then, in order
to obtain t2(x), we split d2(x), which has causal support, supp(d2(x)) 
v +(x)  v (x), into a retarded and an advanced part. this splitting must
be accomplished according to the correct singular order [2] (d2) which shows

4

intuitively the behaviour of d2 near the coincidence point x = 0 or, in mo-
mentum space, the uv behaviour. in this case we nd (d2) = 4. thus,
admitting free normalization terms with coecients c0, c2 and c4, we ob-
tain [3]

t2(p) =

i
2

p (4)(p)

p4

(cid:26)p4 log(cid:18)(p2 + i0)

m 2

(cid:19) + c0 + c2p2 + c4p4(cid:27) . (13)

since c4 can be absorbed into m 2 and mass and coupling constant normal-
izations x unambiguously c0 = c2 = 0, we are left with the new parameter
m which denes a mass scale in the theory. we emphasize the fact that,
in virtue of the causal splitting prescription, all expressions are nite and
eq. (13) agrees exactly with the nite part obtained using ad-hoc regulariza-
tion schemes [7]. as a consequence it is not necessary to add counterterms [8]
to renormalize the theory. besides, eq. (13) satises the slavnov-ward iden-
tity for the 2-points connected green function [7]:

pp{bt2(p)b} = 0,

(14)

as well as perturbative gauge invariance eq. (8): dqt se
2 (x1, x2) = div. for
the tree graphs we quote briey the result of schorn [5]: perturbative gauge
invariance in 2nd order, eq. (8), generates the 4-graviton couplings through
local normalization terms n2(x1, x2) of tree graphs, in agreement with the
expansion of the hilbert-einstein lagrangian eq. (3): n2(x1, x2) = i2 :
l(2)
he(x1) : (x1  x2) . for the sake of completeness, we discuss also the
vacuum graphs in 2nd order: in the causal perturbation theory they cannot
be divided away as in the gml series for connected green functions, but
this is not problematic since they are nite. the corresponding t2 distribu-
tion has singular order  = 6 and reads t2(p) = ip6 log ((p2 + i0)/m 2) +
p3
i=0 c2i(p2)i. it is possible to show that the adiabatic (infrared) limit of vac-
uum graphs exists [9]: limg1(, s2(g)) = 0, where  is the fock vacuum
of free asymptotic elds, as a consequence of the bad uv behaviour of qg
and, at the same time, free vacuum stability forces the free normalization
constants to vanish.

6 outlook

an interesting feature is the explicit construction of the physical hilbert space
of qg. in order to decouple the ghosts and the unphysical degrees of free-

5

dom of the graviton from the theory, we could apply the gupta-bleuler [10]
formalism with indenite metric, but we prefere to realize the free elds
representations on a fock space f with positive denite metric. lorentz co-
variance requires then the introduction of the krein structure [11] in f and
we can characterize the physical subspace fphys by

fphys = ker(cid:8)q, q(cid:9) (cid:8)  f | h(x)(+) = 0(cid:9) .
