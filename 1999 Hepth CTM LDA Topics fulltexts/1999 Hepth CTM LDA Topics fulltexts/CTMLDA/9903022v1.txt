abstract

via supersymmetry argument, we determine the eective action of the su(2) super-
symmetric yang-mills quantum mechanics up to two constants, which results from the
full supersymmetric completion of the f 4 term. the eective action, consisting of zero,
two, four, six and eight fermion terms, agrees with the known perturbative one-loop
calculations from the type ii string theory and the matrix theory. our derivation thus
demonstrates its non-renormalization properties, namely, the one-loop exactness of the
aforementioned action and the absence of the non-perturbative corrections. we briey
discuss generalizations to other branes and the comparison to the dlcq supergravity
analysis. in particular, our results show that the stringent constraints from the super-
symmetry are responsible for the agreement between the matrix theory and supergravity
with sixteen supercharges.

1 introduction and summary

supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics (we alternatively call it matrix theory or

supersymmetric quantum mechanics in this paper) is suggested to provide us with a

quantum description of the eleven-dimensional supergravity in the large n limit [1]. for

the nite n case, the eleven-dimensional supergravity formulated in terms of the discrete

light-cone quantization (dlcq) scheme of susskind [2, 3, 4] is argued to be described by

the supersymmetric quantum mechanics. the agreement of the eective action between

the matrix theory and the dlcq supergravity for particle (or other extended objects in

m theory that we do not consider in this paper) scatterings is by now well-reported in

the literature [5]-[10].

the impressive agreement between these two radically dierent theories naturally lead

us to wonder why they should agree in the rst place. intuitively, supersymmetries should

play a key role; the scattering dynamics analyzed in, for example, refs. [5] and [6] pre-

serves sixteen supersymmetries. the matrix quantum mechanics, being the dimensional

reduction to one-dimension from the ten-dimensional supersymmetric yang-mills (sym)

theory, describes the low energy dynamics of the d-particles in iia string theory [11] and

possesses sixteen supersymmetries along with the so(9) r-symmetry. similarly, the su-

pergravity space-time metric for m-momenta moving along the light-cone direction in the

dlcq supergravity has sixteen killing spinors and so(9) transversal rotational isometry

[10]. in the latter case, the detailed form of the metric is determined by specifying a nine-

dimensional harmonic function, which is obtained by solving the bps equations that are

valid when there exist sixteen unbroken supersymmetries. once the metric is determined
in the supergravity side, the bosonic probe action that produces v4 term in the small

velocity expansion can be straightforwardly written down [6]. given this purely bosonic
v4 term, the supersymmetrization uniquely determines all the other fermion terms via the

superspace formalism [10].

a similar behavior to what happens in the supergravity case has been observed in

the pioneering work of paban, sethi and stern [12] in the matrix quantum mechanics.

they show that, in the case of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics, the eight fermion
terms, that result from the supersymmetric completion of the one-loop f 4 term, can be

uniquely determined (up to an overall normalization) by the supersymmetry argument

1

alone; the coecient functions of the eight fermion terms satisfy an analog of the bps

equations from the supergravity [12]. if the correspondence between the matrix theory

and the supergravity holds up as presumed, one naturally hopes further that the eight

fermion terms, once determined, should determine all the other remaining terms with

zero, two, four, and six fermions. in this paper, we show that the constraints from the

sixteen supersymmetries determine all fermion terms in the eective action belonging to
the full supersymmetric completion of the f 4 terms of the matrix quantum mechanics.

our results demonstrate the formal similarity of the matrix quantum mechanics to the

supergravity where the superspace formalism generates all fermion terms from the purely

bosonic terms.

main benet of this line of approach is that the non-renormalization theorem [12, 13]

for all the terms that we calculate is guaranteed, since the sixteen supersymmetries are

the exact symmetries in our context. our eective action turns out to be identical to the

one-loop perturbative terms reported in the literature including the bosonic term [6], two

fermion terms [8], four fermion terms [14], and eight fermion terms [15]. the six fermion

terms have not been calculated in the perturbative supersymmetric quantum mechanics

framework, but our results are identical to the ones obtained by the perturbative analysis

in the iia string theory framework [16, 17, 18]. in view of these, our analysis demonstrates

the non-renormalization properties, including the one-loop exactness and the lack of non-

perturbative eects, for those terms that originate from the supersymmetric completion
of the f 4 terms. specically, following the notations introduced in sec. 2.1, our results

are:

in other words, the eective action (4) is fully determined up to two constants k1 and k2.

these results are obtained purely on the basis of the existence of sixteen supersymmtries,

so(9) r-symmetry and the cpt invariance. perturbative calculations of the bosonic

eective action within the matrix theory framework [6] show that k1 = 0, while the

supersymmetry allows it to be an arbitrary constant. to recover k1 = 0 from the super-

gravity necessitates the use of the dlcq framework where the asymptotic time direction

of the background geometry is light-like [4, 6, 10]. the resulting background geometry is

the non-asymptotically at near-horizon d-particle geometry in ten dimensions [19], or

equivalently, the asymptotically at aichelberg-sexl geometry in eleven dimensions [4].

the asymptotic time direction of the asymptotically at d-particle background geometry

is time-like, which implies k1 > 0. apart from the necessity of introducing the dlcq

framework, which is strictly speaking beyond supersymmetry argument, the complete ef-

fective action itself is determined by the supersymmetry with sixteen supercharges, up to

an overall normalization. therefore, the stringent constraints imposed by the maximal

supersymmetries are responsible for the agreement for the two-body dynamics between

the dlcq supergravity and the matrix theory when there are sixteen supersymmetries.

in view of this aspect, the crucial future tests to verify the (dis)agreements between the

matrix theory and the supergravity should be directed to the cases when some of the

supersymmetries are broken, as well as to the cases involving multi-body (especially large

n) scatterings [20].

the technical details are presented in sec. 2, and we briey discuss related issues, such

as the extension of our analysis to the membrane case, in sec. 3.

2 supersymmetric completion of f 4 terms

this section is organized as follows. in sec. 2.1, we classify the terms that can appear
in the eective action obtained by the supersymmetric completion of the f 4 terms. the

guiding principles here are the unbroken so(9) r-symmetry and the cpt invariance, both

of which constrain the possible terms in the eective action. appendix a and b contain

some technical details such as a number of relevant fierz identities. in sec. 2.2, starting

from the eective action constrained in sec. 2.1, we explicitly work out the supersymmetry

transformations to determine the full supersymmetrically completed eective action.

2.1 constraints from the so(9) r-symmetry and cpt on the

eective action

the eective action of the sym quantum mechanics is described by nine scalars i and
their time derivatives vi = (d/d)(i)  i where i = 1,    , 9 and  is a time coordinate.
at the origin of the sym moduli space, the r-symmetry is unbroken so(9). this is the

situation that corresponds to the matrix theory description of the source-probe two-body

dynamics where the probe m-momentum moves in the background geometry of the n

coincident source m-momenta. in this paper, we will start by computing the constraints

imposed on the possible terms in the eective action resulting from the requirement of

the unbroken so(9) r-symmetry. furthermore, we will impose the cpt invariance that

the matrix quantum mechanics inherits from the ten-dimensional iia sym theory. our
starting point will be the consideration of the f 2 terms, following the notation and set-up
of ref. [12]. considering the so(9) invariance, the possible bosonic f 2 terms are g1()v2
and g2()(vii)2. here the so(9) vector indices are contracted by the kronecker delta
ij, for example, v2 = ij i j , and g1 and g2 are so(9) invariant scalar functions, which
depend only on an so(9) invariant  = ii. by the inverse of the dieomorphism of
the form

h1()vi  h2()vi + h3()(vjj)i ,

which squares to

h2
1v2  h2

2v2 + (2h2h3 + h2

32)(vjj)2  g1v2 + g2(vii)2 ,

(7)

(8)

4

the general so(9) invariant moduli space metric consisting of the two terms g1v2d2 and
g2(vii)2d2 can be reduced to a simple form as follows

ds2 = g1didi + g2ijdidj = h2

1didi .

(9)

the key result of ref. [12] is that this moduli space metric is constrained to be at (corre-

sponding to a free abelian theory) under the imposition of the supersymmetry with sixteen
supercharges. for the f 2 terms, we thus choose a coordinate such that the quadratic ef-

fective action looks like the following form

(2) = z d (cid:18)1

2

v2 +

i
2

 (cid:19) ,

which is invariant under the supersymmetry transformation

i = ii
 = (ivi).

(10)

(11)

here  is the sixteen component so(9) majorana spinor and gamma matrices i are the
16  16 so(9) gamma matrices. for the following description, we introduce an ordering
o(vi) = o() = o(d/d) = 1 and we assign o() = 1/2 for the so(9) majorana spinor
parameter  for the supersymmetry transformation. the subscript of the eective action

(2) signies the fact that the terms of (10) are of order two under the above ordering

assignment.

what we are interested in in this paper is to determine the order of four terms,
(4), in the eective action when the spinor  and the velocity vi are constant1. in this
case, we can preclude the possible acceleration and high order fermion derivative terms,

which are, in general, present in the eective action. due to the existence of the sixteen

supersymmetries and the ordering assignment in the above, the structure of (4) can be

schematically written as [16, 17]

(4) = z d(cid:16)hv4i +hv32i +hv24i +hv6i +h8i(cid:17) ,

(12)

1these are consistent with the supersymmetry transformation, eq. (11). as will be explained in
sec. 2.2, the inclusion of (4) modies the supersymmetry transformation, eq. (11). the detailed con-
sideration in sec. 2.2 will show that using the leading order supersymmetry transformation, eq. (11), is
enough for (4), while the correction plays an important role for the supersymmetric variation of (2).

where we suppress index structures; it consists of zero, two, four, six and eight fermion

terms. the possible terms that can appear in eq. (12) can be constrained by the re-

quirement of the unbroken so(9) r-symmetry and the cpt theorem, as we will discuss
now. since  is an so(9) majorana spinor, the fermion bilinears satisfy i1i2ik = 0 for
k = 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9. here i1i2ik is the totally anti-symmetrized k-product of gamma matri-

ces normalized to unity. therefore, the fermion structure of the p-fermion term shown in
eq. (12) is in general a (p/2)-product of fermion bilinears j ij  ij and k ijk  ijk.
the terms appearing in eq. (12) can thus be classied as shown in table 1.

table 1. the classication of the possible terms in the eective action.

the superscript vmj nk p denotes the fact that the corresponding terms are composed of
the products of m velocity vector vis, n fermion bilinear j ijs and p fermion bilinears
k ijks. the number r (r = 4,    , 12) in each entry denotes the total number of indices
given by r = m + 2n + 3p. since the terms in the eective action should be an so(9)
scalar, an object with indices should be contracted with an appropriate number of is;
an object with r indices can however be self-contracted s times (0  s  [r/2]) before
the contraction with (r  2s) is. each term in table 1 contains, in addition to the
vmj nk pr2s structure, an arbitrary coecient function as an overall factor that depends
only on an so(9) invariant  = ii.

the cpt invariance dictates that the terms of the second (6v3k, 7v2jk, 8vjjk, 9jjjk)
and the fourth (10vkkk, 11jkkk) columns of table 1 should vanish; the terms in the rst

column, which are of the form of the perturbative terms reported in the literature, are
all cpt invariant, and replacing one j ij with k mnp turns the aforementioned terms cpt

violating. as proven in ref. [12] for the fth row and in appendix a for the other rows,

all the terms in the third and fth columns can be fierz-rearranged into the terms of the

rst column. therefore, we can concentrate on the terms of the rst column from now on,

without losing generality. we note that the cpt violating terms, the terms of the second

and the fourth columns, can not be turned into the terms of the rst column via the fierz

6

rearrangement. noting a fierz identity (ij)(ij) = 0, all the non-vanishing terms of

table 1 can be written down as follows, after working out all possible contractions:

(27)

and

according to the perturbative calculations for zero, two, four and eight fermion terms

and the type ii side calculations [7, 8][14]-[18], the terms of the form (23)-(27) do not

appear in the eective action under the choice of (2) in eq. (10). considering the non-

renormalization theorem of refs. [12] and [13], we can set the coecient functions of

(23)-(27) as zero. in fact, consistent with the analysis of ref. [12], the dieomorphism of

the form eq. (7) generates all the terms of (23)-(27) from (13)-(19), just like the same
dieomorphism generates the (vii)2 term from the bosonic kinetic term v2 in eq. (10) (see

eq. (8)). specically, under the dieomorphism eq. (7), the terms of (13)-(19) generate

the following terms:

(13)  (13) + (23) ,

7

(14)  (14) + (24) ,

(15)  (15) + (26) , (16)  (16) , (17)  (17) + (25) + (26) ,

(18)  (18) , (19)  (19) + (27) ,

where we use the identity ijij = 0. it is instructive to observe the same situation in

the eleven-dimensional dlcq supergravity. in ref. [10], it is shown that (10), (13) and

(14) terms are correctly reproduced from the probe action of a massless eleven-dimensional
superparticle moving in the background geometry produced by n source m-momenta2.
in the same reference, choosing a static gauge (dx 0/d) = 1 renders the kinetic terms

be of the form of (10) and the order of four terms be of the form (13) + (14), while the
terms of the form (vii)2, (23) and (24), are absent.

we are now left to consider the terms of (13)-(22). we note the following property for
the terms of (16)-(22); replacing ij with ij reduces (16) into (17), (18) into (19), (20)
into (21), and (21) into (22), again noting a fierz identity (ij)(ij) = 0. the same

replacement, when applied to (15), makes it vanish. utilizing this property, the terms of

(4) can in general be written as

of the fermion bilinears. thus, vii, for example, has the scalar number zero.

we make the following formal observation; for a function f depending only on an

so(9) invariant , the derivatives respect to i can be computed as follows via the chain

rule:

2.2 supersymmery transformation and the determination of the

coecient functions

from sec. 2.1, we have explicit form of the possible terms of (4). upon adding (4) to

the quadratic terms of (2), the supersymmetry transformation law in eq. (11) should be

modied. we denote the (4)-corrected supersymmetry transformation as

i = ii + n i,
 = ivi + m .

we note that o(n) = 2 and o(m) = 3, which let us schematically write

n i = hv2n i(0)i +hvn i(2)2i +hn i(4)4i

and

m = hv3m (0)i +hv2m (2)2i +hvm (4)4i +hm (6)6i .

when we take the supersymmetry variation of (2) + (4), the supersymmetry transfor-

mation eq. (11) leaves (2) terms invariant. however, the correction terms in eq. (37)

generate fourth order terms from (2). up to an order of four terms, when it comes to

(4) part, considering the variation of (4) under eq. (11) is enough. the correction terms

in eq. (37) when acting on (4) produce terms of order six.

the variation ((2) + (4)) contains one, three, ve, seven and nine  terms, and they

have to separately vanish (up to total derivatives) for the invariance of the eective action

under supersymmetry transformations. specically, we have:

(37)

(38)

(39)

(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)

(44)

f (hv32i) + b(hv4i) + vihv2 n i(0)i  +

where b and f represent the supersymmetric variation of the bosonic elds and the
fermionic elds, respectively. the symbol  denotes the fact that the equality holds up

b(h8i)  0 ,

10

to a total derivative. we can rewrite eqs. (40)-(43) for an easier tractability by introducing
16  16 matrices

i

l(p) = 

2 hv3p/2m t (p)2i + vihv2p/2n i(p)i ,

where p = 0, 2, 4, 6. in terms of l(p), eqs. (40)-(43) become:

f (hv32i) + b(hv4i) + vi 
f (hv24i) + b(hv32i) + vi 
f (hv6i) + b(hv24i) + vi 
f (h8i) + b(hv6i) + vi 

i (cid:16)l(0)(cid:17) = 0 ,
i (cid:16)l(2)(cid:17) = 0 ,
i (cid:16)l(4)(cid:17) = 0 ,
i (cid:16)l(6)(cid:17) = 0 ,

(45)

(46)

(47)

(48)

(49)

modulo acceleration terms and higher fermion derivative terms. modulo the same terms,

the time derivative d/d has been replaced as

d

d  vi 
i .

(50)

we also absorbed the possible total derivative terms (if any) into l(p). in general, consid-
ering the fact that  is multiplied from the right side of l(p) in eqs. (46)-(49), the part of
matrices l(p) that can give non-trivial contributions to eqs. (46)-(49) can be expanded as

l(p) = a(p)i16 + a(p)ii + a(p)ijij + a(p)ijkijk + a(p)ijklijkl ,

(51)

where a(p)s are so(9) totally anti-symmetric tensors made of p-fermions , (3  p/2)-
vectors vi and an appropriate number of scalars i. each term in eq. (51) has a coecient

function depending only on an so(9) invariant . our goal is to solve eqs. (46)-(49) and

(44) to determine the coecient functions of the eective action.

we rst compute f ([v32]) to get

f (hv32i) = 2f (2)

1 (v2)2i(i)  2f (2)

1 v2vi(vjj)(i) ,

and we have

b(hv4i) = i  d

d! f (0)(v2)2i(i) .

(52)

(53)

we plug eqs. (52) and (53) into eq. (46). we note that the two terms of eq. (52) can
not cancel with each other. since eqs. (52) and (53) contain only (i), we can set a(0),

11

a(0)ij, a(0)ijk and a(0)ijkl to zero in eq. (51). furthermore, the possible terms of a(0)i can
not contain factors like (vii)n (n > 0), for the partial derivative vi/(i) then produces
(vii)n+1 terms when acting on their coecient functions. the resulting terms are not

present in eqs. (52) and (53). this leaves us with a unique possibility

l(0) = h(0)v2vi(i).

(54)

upon inserting eq. (54) into eq. (46), the second term of eq. (52) should cancel the term

from eq. (54) resulting

d! h(0) = 2f (2)
  d

1 .

the rst term of eq. (52) should cancel eq. (53) to yield

f (2)
1 =

i

2   d

d! f (0) .

(55)

(56)

the spin-orbit coupling term f (2)
is now determined in terms of the bosonic coecient
function f (0). it is identical to the one-loop result computed in ref. [8] using the pertur-

1

(58)

and

we note that the rst term of the g(4)
2 -dependent terms of eq. (57) can not be canceled
with any other terms of eqs. (57) and (58). for the same reason as before, we set a(2) = 0
and consider terms of l(2) that do not contain (vii)n (n > 0) terms. all possible
candidates from l(2) are as follows:

(i)(ij)v2j

(i)(jk)vivjk

(67)

(68)

(69)

recalling the fierz identities in appendix b. the terms of eqs. (61)-(69) look as if they
can possibly cancel the g(4)
2 -dependent terms of eq. (57). however, once the derivative
vi/i is taken, the maximum scalar number of the terms resulting from eqs. (61)-(69)
that do not contain the (vii) factor is one, while the g(4)

2 -dependent terms in eq. (57)
has the maximum scalar number of two. therefore, there are no other terms to cancel
the g(4)

2 -dependent terms in eq. (47) and this gives a non-trivial result

g(4)
2 = 0.

(70)

at the same time, we are now forced to set all the terms of eqs. (61)-(69) to zero.

from the perturbative one-loop four fermion terms calculated in ref. [14], we know that,

perturbatively, the spin-spin terms are absent among the four fermion terms. eq. (70) is

the non-perturbative version of the same statement. to solve the remaining equations,

we set

l(2) = h(2)

1 v2j(i)(ij) + h(2)

1 vivjk(i)(jk),

from eqs. (59) and (60), which yields

d! h(2)

these are precisely the same as the perturbatively calculated one-loop spin-orbit four

fermion terms [14].

we now consider eq. (48). we compute

f (hv6i) = f (6)

vijklf h(ij)(km)(lm)i =

2vijklh vi(j)(km)(lm)  vj(i)(km)(lm)

+2vp(mpk)(lm)(ij) + 2vk(m)(lm)(ij)

and the (apparent) one scalar term of eq. (76) is

vikf h(ij)(jm)(km)i =

2kh v2(j)(jm)(km)  vivp(i)(pm)(km)

+vivp(pkm)(jm)(ij) + vivp(pjm)(km)(ij)

(76)

(77)

(78)

(79)

among the terms of eqs. (78) and (79), there are terms with a single (vii) factor and
terms of the form (mpk)(lm)(ij). via fierz identities, the second group of terms

can be reduced to the simpler terms like the ones in eq. (77). in this process, some of

the indices appearing in the fermion bilinears are contracted, resulting the contractions

among the vs and s. closer inspection of the fierz identities and the structure of the

terms of eqs. (78) and (79) show that the double contractions of vs and s vanish and

only a single contraction is allowed for the terms of eqs. (78) and (79). therefore, the

terms of eqs. (76) and (77) are classied as shown in table 2.

table 2. the classication of the terms appearing in eq. (48). pairs of numbers (r, s) shown in

the second column denote the scalar number and the number of (vii), respectively. the terms

with dierent (r, s) can not cancel with each other. each entry in the table shows the so(9)

scalar factor of each term, suppressing the degeneracy and the tensor structures.

also shown in table 2 is the classication of the terms from l(4) that show up in eq. (48).
generally, the possible terms of l(4) include zero, one, two and three scalar structure
terms whose scalar coecient functions we denote as h(4)
q where q (q = 0, 1, 2, 3) is the
number of scalars, since l(4)  (i1)(j1)(k1). the three scalar structure
terms of l(4) produce (3, 1) and (2, 0) terms that do not appear elsewhere in eq. (48),
upon taking the derivative vi/(i). likewise, the one scalar structure terms of l(4)

yield (1, 1) and (0, 0) terms in eq. (48), which are also absent in table 2. as such, the
coecient functions h(4)
of l(4) are non-vanishing and they correspond to the h(4)

1 = 0. therefore, only the two scalar and zero scalar terms
columns of table 2.

it is seen to be clear how to determine the scalar coecient functions. we notice from
the row (a) of table 2 that there are no contributions from l(4) for the maximum scalar
structure terms of type (3, 0)4. the (3, 0) terms from eq. (78) should directly cancel the

order; as the number of fermions increases, we need progressively more complicated fierz

identities. especially when the fierz identities involve two dierent constant spinors 

and , they become even more complicated. for the simplication of the computations,
we note that an arbitrary  can be obtained by multiplying  with an appropriate 16 16
matrix. recalling a complete expansion of the form (51), it is thus equivalent to consider
 (which typically produces trivial results), i, ij, ijk and ijkl in place of . from
now on, we will replace  with i. the cases for ij, ijk and ijkl can be analyzed in

a similar fashion to show the complete consistency.

upon replacing   n and retaining the maximum three scalar terms of eq. (77),

we have

and

3 vivpjklhip(nj)(km)(lm) + 2np(ij)(km)(lm)

2nk(ij)(pm)(lm)i ,

from eq. (78) (apparent) three scalar terms using the wick theorem. we have to check
whether the terms of eq. (81) turn into the terms of eq. (80) up to (vii) terms and the

lower scalar number terms. using the fierz identities eqs. (115)-(119), we can show that:

(80)

(81)

vivpjklhip(nj)(km)(lm) + 2np(ij)(km)(lm)

2nk(ij)(pm)(lm)i

= vivpjklh45(nl)(ij)(pk)

4ip(nj)(km)(lm)
8np(ij)(km)(lm)
+8nk(ij)(pm)(lm)i

+(vii) terms and lower scalar terms .

(82)

16

we start from using fierz identity eq. (116). we sequentially use the fierz identity

eq. (115) and the ve free index fierz identities, eqs. (117)-(119) to reduce the terms

of the left hand side into the form where we can use the fierz identity eq. (116). then,
using eq. (116) again further reduces all the terms into the three products of (ij)s,

producing the identity eq. (82). in this process, noticing the permutation symmetry of
jkl simplies the calculations. eq. (82) can be rearranged to yield:

vivpjklhip(nj)(km)(lm) + 2np(ij)(km)(lm)

2nk(ij)(pm)(lm)i

= 9vivpjkl(nl)(ij)(pk) + (vii) terms and lower scalar terms . (83)

now eq. (83) immediately implies that eq. (81) becomes

18f (6)

3 vivpjkl(nl)(ij)(pk) + (vii) terms and lower scalar terms ,

(84)

and, via eq. (48), yields

f (6)

now that we determined f (6)
determine the function f (6)

2 =

(86)

we remark that we again need to use the ve free index fierz identities shown in appendix

b. the terms of the eective action, eqs. (85) and (86), for six fermion mixed spin-

orbit spin-spin couplings have not yet been calculated within the perturbative matrix

theory framework. however, eqs. (85) and (86) are identical to the corresponding terms

computed from the perturbative iia string theory framework [17, 18].

before proceeding to eq. (49), we recall that the eight fermion terms in the eective

action can be completely determined up to an overall normalization by solving eq. (44)

[12]. thus, the remaining task is only to consider the maximum scalar number terms of

eq. (49), which links the bosonic variation of the three scalar term of the six fermion

terms to the fermionic variation of the four scalar term of the eight fermion terms. as
noted in the computation of the six fermion terms, the knowledge of l(6) terms is not

17

necessary for this purpose. furthermore, replacing  with i is enough to get the desired
result. the consideration of , ij, ijk and ijkl in place of  can be straightforwardly

performed to show the complete consistency, although the computations are quite lengthy

in these cases. we compute the fermionic variation of the eight fermion terms

f (h8i) = f (8)
4 ijklf h(im)(jm)(kn)(ln)i
+4f (8)
2 ikjlf h(im)(jm)(kn)(ln)i
0 ikjlf h(im)(jm)(kn)(ln)i

+2f (8)

and the bosonic variation of the three scalar term of the six fermion terms

b(hv6i) = i  d

d! f (6)

+ lower scalar terms ,

3 vpijkl(i)(pj)(kn)(ln)

(87)

(88)

both of which appear in eq. (49). written explicitly, the (apparent) four scalar term of

eq. (87) is given by

f (8)
4 ijklf h(im)(jm)(kn)(ln)i =
8f (8)
4 ijklhvp(pim)(jm)(kn)(ln)  vm(i)(jm)(kn)(ln)i .

(89)

upon the replacement   s, the four scalar terms of eq. (88) become
3 ijklvp(si)(pj)(kn)(ln) ,

 i  d

d! f (6)

(90)

and eq. (89) becomes

8f (8)
4 ijklvphsi(pm)(mj)(kn)(ln) + sp(mi)(mj)(kn)(ln)i ,

(91)

using the wick theorem. we have to check whether the terms of eq. (91) become the
form of eq. (90) up to (vii) terms and the lower scalar number terms. using the fierz

identities in appendix b, we can show the following identity:

ijklvphsi(pm)(mj)(kn)(ln) + sp(mi)(mj)(kn)(ln)i

= ijklvph35(si)(pj)(kn)(ln)

+6si(pm)(mj)(kn)(ln)

+6sp(mi)(mj)(kn)(ln)i

+(vii) terms and lower scalar terms .

(92)

18

in deriving eq. (92), we rst use the fierz identity eq. (116). next, eq. (115) and the

ve free index fierz identities, eqs. (118) and (119), are utilized to transform the terms

on the left hand side into the form where we can use the fierz identity eq. (116) again.
then, upon using eq. (116), we reduce all the terms into four products of (ij)s. using

the identity eq. (92), we rewrite eq. (91) as

56f (8)

4 ijklvp(si)(pj)(kn)(ln)

+(vii) terms and lower scalar terms ,

(93)

(94)

which, via eq. (49), implies

7 + k32 + k44 + k56 ,

(95)

(96)

where k1, k3, k4, k5 are constants of integration and k2 = (128/143)c. the   
limit of the f 4 terms should be nite from the physical point of view and we thus set

k3 = k4 = k5 = 0. we therefore nd that

(97)

eqs. (94) and (97) are identical to the one-loop spin-spin terms calculated in ref. [15].

this completes our analysis and we derived the results shown in sec. 1, eqs. (1)-(6), by

collecting eqs. (10), (96), (56), (70), (74), (75), (85), (86), (94) and (97).

3 discussions

the consideration in this paper has been restricted to the case of the m-momentum

scatterings. however, for the extended objects, we can also use the results of the analysis

19

presented in this paper as far as the center of mass dynamics is concerned. for example,

for the membrane dynamics considered in ref. [22] (see also [21]), the four scalar term of

the eight fermion terms in n-instanton sector has been computed to be

f (8)
4 = k1n13/213/2k13/2(n/g)ein8/g,

(98)

respectively. here k1 and g are dimensionful constants and k is the modied bessel
function with a half-integer coecient . the so(7) vectors i (i = 1,    , 7 ) combine
to give an so(7) invariant 2 = ii, and 8 is the dual magnetic scalar. it can be easily

from the recursion relation

(zk(z)) = (1)azak+a(z),

(101)

(102)

we can immediately write down the inhomogeneous solutions of eqs. (99) and (100) as

4f (8)
2 = 4k1gn11/211/2k11/2(n/g)ein8/g

2f (8)

0 = 2k1g2n9/29/2k9/2(n/g)ein8/g ,

(103)

(104)

where we simultaneously use eq. (101) to delete the second derivative terms and the zero

derivative terms of eqs. (99) and (100). noting that

f (0) = k2n5/25/2k5/2(n/g)ein8/g ,

(105)

where k2 is a constant, from ref. [21] and recalling eq. (102), we conclude that eqs. (103)

and (104) are completely consistent with eq. (5) for p = 4 and q = 0, 2, 4. it will be

interesting to apply this type of arguments to the higher brane two-body dynamics.

20

the derivation presented in sec. 2.2 does not appear to sensitively depend on the

existence of the unbroken so(9) r-symmetry, even if the classication of the possible

terms in sec. 2.1 does. consequently, for an arbitrary point in the moduli space, that

generally breaks so(9) to its subgroup and represents an arbitrarily separated source

m-momenta, we write down the eective action (by the linear superposition of the source

m-momenta, which is valid when there are full supersymmetries):

ijklf (im)(jm)(kn)(ln)i ,

(106)

where f is an arbitrary nine-dimensional harmonic function that vanishes as i  
and we use the normalization convention of the quadratic terms of eq. (10). the for-

mal observation at the end of sec. 2.1 is used to write down the action (106). up to

two fermion terms, eq. (106) agrees with the probe dynamics calculations in the dlcq

supergravity framework using the multi-center m-momenta solutions as the background

geometry [10]. the multi-center background geometry solutions of the dlcq supergrav-

ity preserve the sixteen supersymmetries as in the case of the single center solutions.

furthermore, the bps solution space for the n source m-momenta from the supergravity
is the n-symmetric product of r9, just like the sym quantum mechanics moduli space.

beyond our analysis presented in this paper, a possible next step is to repeat the
same type of analysis to the f 6 terms. the supersymmetric completion of these terms,
once determined, can be used to prove the two-loop exactness of the v6 term, which is a

necessary element in rmly establishing the matrix theory/dlcq supergravity correspon-

dence. furthermore, at this order, we expect that the matrix theory produces genuine

quantum gravity corrections to the eleven-dimensional supergravity. it will be interesting

to explicitly compute these terms and compare them to the quantum corrected dlcq

supergravity and to the type ii stringy corrections. another very interesting issue, as

mentioned in sec. 1, is to understand how much of the constructions presented here can

survive under the supersymmetry breaking.

appendix

a reduction of ijk products to ij products

we start from writing all possible terms of 8v2kk. there are seven possible terms:

(vii)2jk(jlm)(klm) ,

v2ij(ikl)(jkl) ,

vivjkl(ikm)(jlm) ,

(vii)vjk(jlm)(klm) ,

(vii)2(jkl)(jkl) ,

v2(ijk)(ijk) ,

vivj(ikl)(jkl) .

using the fierz identities (108), (113) and (116), we can show that all the terms in the
above reduce to the terms of 6v2jj or vanish. in the case of the terms of 7v2jk, there are

terms like

vivjk(il)(ljk),

which can not be reduced to the terms of 6v2jj even if we use fierz identities; the number

of scalars do not match.

the possible 9vjkk terms are as follows.

vijkl(ij)(kmn)(lmn) ,

vij(ik)(kmn)(jmn) ,

vij(ij)(klm)(klm) ,

22

vijkl(jm)(ikn)(lmn) ,

vim(jl)(ijk)(klm) ,

vim(lm)(ijk)(jkl) ,

vim(kl)(ijm)(jkl) ,

(vii)jk(jl)(kmn)(lmn) ,

(vii)jk(lm)(jln)(kmn) ,

(vii)(jk)(jlm)(klm) = 0 .

again, these terms either vanish or reduce to the terms of 7vjjj upon using the fierz

identities eqs. (108), (113) and (116).

implementing that algorithm using mathematica, we obtain the following fierz identities.

(a1a2i)(a1a2) = 2(a1)(a1i)
