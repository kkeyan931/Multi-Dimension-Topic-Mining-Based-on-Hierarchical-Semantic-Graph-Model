abstract

by using the eld-antield formalism, we show that the method
of batalin, fradkin, fradkina and tyutin to convert hamiltonian sys-
tems submitted to second class constraints introduces compensating
elds which do not belong to the brst cohomology at ghost number
one. this assures that the gauge symmetries which arise from the
bfft procedure are not obstructed at quantum level. an example
where massive electrodynamics is coupled to chiral fermions is con-
sidered. we solve the quantum master equation for the model and
show that the respective counterterm has a decisive role in extracting
anomalous expectation values associated with the divergence of the
noether chiral current.

1 introduction

the seminal works of dirac [1] on constraint hamiltonian systems have been
developed in several important research lines. one of these developments is
due to fradkin, fradkina, batalin and tyutin (bfft) [2], where hamiltonian
systems submitted to second class constraints are conveniently considered.
the method of bfft consists in enlarging the original phase-space of the
theory by adding compensating elds which permit to convert the second
class constraints into rst class ones. in doing so, it is possible to avoid dirac
brackets which can present severe problems when one follows the canonical
approach to quantization [3]. as rst class constraints are also necessarily
associated with local gauge symmetries, a system converted by the bfft
procedure can be treated by using all the machinery associated with the
brst formalism [4].

the brst approach for quantization of gauge theories appears with all
its power in the eld-antield formalism [5, 3, 6]. this formalism gives an
elegant and systematic way for constructing the functional generator of any
general gauge theory, with possible reducible or open gauge algebras. at the
same time, eventual obstructions to the gauge symmetries due to quantum
eects are naturally taken in account inside the eld-antield formalism.

in this work we consider, by using some tools of the eld-antield formal-
ism, the quantization of rst order gauge theories which have been obtained
from second class constrained systems by the process of conversion developed
by bfft. we show that the compensating elds introduced by the conver-
sion procedure do not belong to the brst cohomology [3] at ghost number
one. so there is no possible term in the space of elds and antields with
ghost number one and brst closed not being brst exact. this means that
the wess-zumino consistence condition [6] is solved in a trivial way: there is
no gauge anomaly for such class of systems and the quantum master equa-
tion can always be solved with the inclusion of a proper counterterm in the
quantum action. it is useful to observe that this counterterm, if it exists, can
play a non-trivial role. we give an example where massive electrodynamics
couples to chiral fermions. there we show that it is necessary to introduce a
non-trivial counterterm in order to solve the quantum master equation. this
counterterm permit us to extract an anomalous expectation value related to
the divergence of the fermion noether chiral current.

1

we would like to note that compensating elds have been largely em-
ployed directly inside lagrangian descriptions [7, 8]. there the purpose is
not converting second class constraints, but to enlarge the symmetry content
of a theory in such a way that the original description is recovered within
some gauge choice. under this last point of view, bfft and lagrangian
compensating elds play similar roles.
in several examples of lagrangian
descriptions it is proved that compensating elds also do not belong to the
cohomology at ghost number one and can be used as well to extract anoma-
lous expectation values of physically relevant quantities [9].

we organized this work as follows: in section 2 we present a brief re-
view of the bfft conversion of rst order systems submitted to pure second
class constraints. we display the local gauge invariance of the rst order ac-
tion which is introduced by the bfft compensating elds. the functional
quantization of such a system is described in section 3, by using the tools of
the eld-antield formalism. we derive the brst dierential and explicitly
show that the bfft variables do not belong to the brst cohomology at
ghost number one. this assures that the quantum master equation can be
solved for any system of this class. in section 4 the ideas presented in the
rst sections are applied to a model which describes massive electrodynamics
coupled to chiral fermions in four space-time dimensions. by using a regu-
larization that keeps the vector symmetry as a preferential one, the quantum
master equation is solved with the introduction of an specic counterterm in
the quantum action. a few dierent gauge xing choices are explored and co-
variant actions are obtained. when the gauge freedom is xed by identifying
the compensating elds with external functions, we show that the indepen-
dence of the path integral with respect to those external functions permit us
to derive expectation values which are related to the anomalous divergence of
the noether chiral current. we reserve section 5 to some general comments
and concluding remarks.

2 first order systems submitted to second

class constraints

in this section we will review a few topics on constrained hamiltonian systems
[3] and on the bfft conversion procedure [2] in order to x notations and
to introduce some results that will be useful for further developments. let
us start by considering a generic rst order system living in a (phase) space
with discrete bosonic coordinates y,  = 1, 2, ..., 2n. the extension to more
general situations can be trivially done. its action is written as

s0 = z dt (b y    h)

(2.1)

where b, h and  are in principle arbitrary functions of the coordinates
but do not depend on the velocities. the lagrange multipliers  are to be
regarded as independent quantities. from the above expression one can read
the symplectic form

f =

b
y 

b
y

(2.2)

which has an inverse f  if the system is well dened. with its aid, we can
dene the brackets between any two functions a(y) and b(y) as

it follows that

{a, b} =

a
y

f  b
y

{y, y} = f 

(2.3)

(2.4)

the brackets appearing in the above expressions can be interpreted as
poisson brackets only in a broad sense, since they take in account the pri-
mary second class constraints of the diracs scheme [10]. in this sense they
are primary dirac brackets. let now h and ,  = 1, 2, ..., 2n, represent
respectively a rst class hamiltonian and a set of second class constraints.
the hamiltonian and the constraints then satisfy the structure

{, } = 
{h, } = v 

 

3

(2.5)

as the s are second class, the constraint matrix  is regular.

it may be convenient to extend the phase-space by adding compensating
variables ,  = 1, 2, . . . , 2n, but at the same time converting the set of
second class constraints into a rst-class one. this assures that the number
of degrees of freedom is not changed by the process, which also introduces
local symmetries that permit one to quantize the theory by using the powerful
tools of local gauge theories.

to perform this conversion through the bfft procedure, it is assumed
that the bfft compensating variables  satisfy fundamental brackets given
by

{, } = 

(2.6)

where  is some constant, antissymmetric and invertible matrix. in order to
avoid the introduction of further second class constraints, it may be conve-
nient to choose  in such a way that the compensating variables form a set
of canonical conjugated quantities. in any case, it follows that in the bfft
extended space, the brackets between any two quantities a(y, ) and b(y, )
are written as

{a, b} =

a
y

f  b

y +

a


 b


(2.7)

as both sectors are independent.

the general idea of the bfft algorithm is to replace the old set of sec-
ond class constraints and the old hamiltonian by a new set of rst class
constraints  = (y, ) and hamiltonian h = h(y, ) in such a way that
they become involutive:

{ , } = 0
{ h, } = 0

(2.8)

by requiring that a(y, 0) = a(y) for any quantity a dened in the ex-
tended space, it is assured that the original formulation of the theory is

4

recovered when the unitary gauge  = 0 is implemented.
[2] it
is proved that eqs. (2.8), submitted to the above condition, always have a
power series solution in the compensating variables, with coecients with
only y dependence. the second class constraints, for instance, can be ex-
tended to

in refs.

(y, ) = (y) + x(y) + x(y) + . . .

(2.9)

conditions (2.8) impose restrictions on the expansion coecients. as an

example, the regular matrices x must satisfy the identity

xx = 

(2.10)

even if some quantity a(y) is not a second class constraint, it can also be
extended to a(y, ) in order to be involutive with the converted constraints
. following the bfft procedure we can show that in this situation

a(y, ) = a(y)  x {, a} + ...

(2.11)

where the dots represent al least second order corrections in  to a(y). in
(2.11), the matrix x with contravariant indices is to be considered as the
inverse of the corresponding covariant one. now it is possible to prove that
the rst order action

s0 = z dt [b y + b      h]

(2.12)

is invariant under the gauge transformations

y = {y, }
 = {, }
 = 

(2.13)

by using the jacobi identity and eqs. (2.8) we see that (2.13) close in an
abelian algebra. as in (2.2), in (2.12) b is related to the inverse of 
through

5

 =

b
 

b


(2.14)

one can always choose b = 1
some of the above equations, it is not dicult to show that

2  without loss of generality. by using

[b y + b      h] =

d
dt

{[bf   

y + b  

  ]} (2.15)

and consequently (2.12) is indeed invariant under the local gauge transfor-
mations (2.13), provided boundary terms can be discarded.

3 quantization

, c

, 

, 

a = (y

let us perform the quantization of the system described above along the
eld-antield formalism [5, 3, 6]. to do so it is rst necessary to introduce an-
tields 
) corresponding to the elds a = (y, , , c).
in our case, y,  and  are bosonic and have ghost number zero. the
ghosts c are fermionic and have ghost number one. the corresponding an-
tields have opposite grassmanian parity and ghost number given by minus
the ghost number of the corresponding eld minus one. one can verify that
the eld-antield action

s = s0 +z dt [y

{y, }c + 

{, }c + 

 c]

(3.1)

(3.2)

satises then the classical master equation

1
2

(s, s) = 0

where the antibracket between any two quantities x[, ] and y [, ] is
ly
dened as (x, y ) = rx
a . when pertinent, we are assuming the
a
de witts notation of sum and integration over intermediary variables.

 rx

a

ly

a

6

in the bv formalism, the brst dierential is introduced through

s x = (x, s)

(3.3)

for any local functional x = x[, ]. as a consequence of the master
equation (3.2) and jacobi identity, s is nilpotent. so, saying that the bv
action satises the master equation is equivalent to say that it is brst
invariant.

to x a gauge we need to introduce trivial pairs c ,  as new elds,
and the corresponding antields c, , as well as a gauge-xing fermion .
the antields are eliminated by choosing 
a . it is always possible to
choose

a = 

 = c

(3.4)

associated with the unitary gauge, but dierent choices can be done. it is
also necessary to extend the eld-antield action to a non-minimal one

s  snm = s +z dt c

(3.5)

in order to implement the gauge xing introduced by . the gauge-xed
vacuum functional is then dened as

z = z [da][det ] 1

2 [det f ] 1

2 exp{

i
h

snm[a, 

a 


a ]}

(3.6)

in the unitary gauge, we observe that besides the identication c =
, 
 = c, all the other antields vanish. with this and the use of eqs.
(2.9-2.10), we see that formally (3.6) reduces to the senjanovic [11] path
integral

z = z [dy]| det f | 1

2 []| det |

exp(cid:26) i

h z dt[b y  h](cid:27)

1

2

(3.7)

7

actually this reduction can only be done if quantum eects do not obstruct
the gauge symmetries. possible obstructions are related to the dependence
of the path integral with respect to redenitions of the gauge-xing fermion
. in general, if the classical eld-antield action s can be replaced by some
quantum action w expressed as a local functional of elds and antields and
satisfying the so-called quantum master equation

1
2

(w, w )  ihw = 0

(3.8)

then the gauge symmetries are not obstructed at quantum level. in expression
(3.8) we have introduced the potentially singular operator   r
and
a
it was assumed that w can be expanded in powers of h as

l

a

w [a, 

a] = s[a, 

a] +

hpmp[a, 
a]

(3.9)



xp=1

the two rst terms of the quantum master equation (3.8) are

(s, s) = 0

(m1, s) = i s

(3.10)
(3.11)

as expected, the tree approximation gives (3.2). eq. (3.11) is only formal,
since the action of the operator  must be regularized. if it vanishes when
applied on s, the quantum action w can be identied with s. if s gives a
non-trivial result but there exists some m1 expressed in terms of local elds
such that (3.11) is satised, gauge symmetries are not obstructed at one loop
order. otherwise, the theory presents an anomaly

a[ ,  ] = s + i(s, m1) = a c + . . . .

(3.12)

the nilpotency of the brst operator implies that sa = 0, which is the
wess-zumino consistence condition. so, looking for possible anomalies in
any theory is the same as looking for local functionals with ghost number
one that are brst closed (sa = 0) but not brst exact (a 6= sb).

by using cohomological arguments, we can show that the quantum master
equation, for rst order systems with pure second class constraints converted

8

with the use of the bfft procedure, can always be solved. to prove this,
let us rst derive the brst transformations of the elds and antields for
the converted system:

s y = {y, }c
s  = {, }c
s  = c
s c = 0
s c = 
s = 0

s y

 = 

s 

 = 

s
y
s


 = 
 = y
 = 0

s 
s c
s c
s  = c

{y, }  

{, }  

(3.13)

where s is given by (3.1). we see that c and  form brst doublets
(s b = c , s c = 0) and do not belong to the brst cohomology [3]. the
same is true for their antields. to show that the other elds and antields
do not contribute to the cohomology at ghost number one, it is enough to
study the cohomology of the linearized piece of s, which will be denoted by
s(1)[12]. if we assume that in the process of conversion of the constraints (see
eq. (2.9)), the invertible matrix x(y) can be written as a power series in y
(which will be the case for the example we are going to consider),

x(y) = x (0)

 + x (1)

y + x (2)

 yy + . . .

(3.14)

we see that

s(1)  = x (0)

 c

9

s(1) c = 0

(3.15)

the equations above imply that  and c  = x (0)
 c form doublets un-
der the action of s(1) and as a consequence they also do not belong to the
cohomology . as c is trivially obtained from c , and since it is the only fun-
damental eld (or antield) with positive ghost number, it is not possible to
construct a local functional with ghost number one that is brst closed not
being brst exact. this means that any candidate to an anomaly can always
be canceled by some counterterm m. so the situations found in [8] and later
explored in [9] appear also here: enlarged symmetries due to compensating
elds ( here the bfft variables ) are not anomalous . this does not mean
that they have a trivial role at the quantum level since the existence of a
counterterm modify expectation values of relevant physical quantities [9]. in
the next section we are going to show an example where all of these features
are carefully taken in account in order to derive consistent quantum actions.

4 massive vector elds coupled to chiral

fermions

we shall now apply the ideas discussed above to massive chiral electrodynam-
ics. although the fermions couple only one chirality to the connection a,
the second class system presents no gauge anomaly since it exhibits no gauge
symmetry. when it is converted to a rst class one, however, the fermions
pass to transform in a chiral way and such a gauge transformation is known
to lead to possible anomalies [13]. accordingly to the ideas discussed in the
last section, however, the bfft variables play the role of wess-zumino elds
and permit us to write the anomaly candidates as brst exact functionals,
solving in this way the quantum master equation at one loop order.

we start by considering the rst order action

s0 = z d4xn a + i 0   h  o

where the second class constraints

(4.1)

ant derivatives d+
 acting on the fermion  and the chiral projectors p 
respectively as

p  =

(4.4)

we have also adopted the metric convention  = diag(1, +1, +1, +1).
dirac matrices satisfy the usual anticommutation relation {, } = 2.
as one can verify, action (4.1) is the rst order version of

scov = z d4x(cid:20)

 (cid:21)

from (4.1) we extract the fundamental (equal time) brackets

for the fermionic sector and

n(x), (y)o = i03(x  y)

{a(x), (y)} = 

3(x  y)

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

for the bosonic one. by using the above expressions, one can show, for
instance, that the fermionic chiral current

j   p +

(4.8)

11

has brackets between its components given by

{j (x), j (y)} = ie2 m  p + 3(x  y)

m  = 0  0

(4.9)

it is now easy to verify that the constraints and the hamiltonian satisfy

the bracket structure

{1(x), 2(y)} = m23(x  y)

{1(x), h} = 2(x)
{2(x), h} = ii1(x)

(4.10)

let us now use the bfft algorithm for implementing the abelian conver-
sion of the above bracket structure. as we have two second class constraints,
we introduce two bfft variables ,  = 1, 2, and for simplicity demand
that they satisfy

{(x), (y)} = 3(x  y)

(4.11)
in (4.11) 12 = 21 = 1,
which gives the matrix  as in eq.
11 = 22 = 0. a possible solution to eqs. (2.8) via (2.9-2.11) is achieved
with [2]

(2.6).

(4.15)

in the expressions above  are arbitrary space-time dependent parame-

ters. we note that the variables a are invariant under (4.15).

in order to quantize this system along the lines of the eld-antield for-
malism, associated with the parameters  we introduce the ghosts c. we
introduce also the trivial pairs , c and write down a gauge-xed vacuum
functional as in (3.6) with

snm = s0 +z dxdha0c1  m2

where some proper gauge-xing fermion  is assumed. now observe that the
terms in snm which involve the matter elds are

(4.16)

(4.17)

i h0(cid:16)0  iep +( a0  2)(cid:17) + id+
i i 

the quantities a0 = a0  2 and ai = ai transform as s a = c2.
as the fermions also transform consistently, as can be seen from (4.15), we
obtain the action of the operator  over s adopting canonical procedures.
for instance, in a pauli-villars regularization scheme with a fermionic mass
term with usual form, which means that the vector symmetry is taken as a
preferential one, we see that

s = 

1

96 z d4xc2 f f

(4.18)

13

where f =  a   a and possible normal parity terms in the origi-
nal space of elds have been discarded. eq. (4.18) represents the essential
candidate to the anomaly. it is easy to see, however, that

m1 =

i

96 z d4x2 f f

(4.19)

solves the one loop master equation, which means that we have achieved a
consistent route for the quantization of the theory. the gauge xed vacuum
functional reads

z = z [da] exp( i

h

w [a, 

a =



a ])

(4.20)

with [da] = (a, , , , , , c, c, ), and all possible information
about the system can be obtained from it. if we wish to write an eective
quantum action in an explicitly covariant way we may eliminate the momenta
through functional integrations in (4.20). let us assume that the gauge
xing fermion  does not depend on 1 or , consequently 
 = 0.
suppose also that  possibly depends on 2 only through an a0 dependence.
integration in 1 and 0 results in the substitution 0  m22 in w . under
the redenition

obtain, after a few trivial integrations and the absorption of some trivial

which is a surprising result. if we observe, however, that j  = m2a as
a consequence of the equations of motion for the eld a in the unitary gauge,
we can interpret eq.
(4.28) as the anomalous divergence of the noether
current (4.8) associated to the rigid chiral symmetry present in the original
theory given by actions (4.1-4.5). this is an unexpected result derived from
the quantum bfft formalism. similar results have recently been derived by
using compensating elds at lagrangian level [9]. in these last approaches,
the compensating elds coupled directly to the chiral current in an extended
qcd which presents not only vector but also chiral gauge symmetry.

5 conclusions

in this work we have considered the bfft quantization of rst order systems
submitted to pure second class constraints. we have shown that the gauge
symmetries introduced by the bfft procedure are not obstructed at quan-
tum level, since the compensating elds do not belong to the brst cohomol-
ogy at ghost number one. an specic example has been given, where massive
electrodynamics couples to chiral fermions. the quantum master equation
has been solved and the corresponding counterterm has played an essential
role in extracting anomalous expectation values of physically relevant quanti-
ties. we would like to nish by commenting that a few generalizations could
have been considered. we could have started from an already gauge invari-
ant rst order system with both rst and second class constraints. then it
would be necessary to take care of both symmetry sectors, the original one
and that introduced by the bfft conversion procedure. another possibility
could be considering examples with more involving algebraic structure, as
it occurs with some of the models cited in ref.
[2]. we are now studying
aspects of these subjects and results will be reported elsewhere [14].
