abstract

the two-dimensional chiral anomaly is calculated using dierential regular-
ization.
it is shown that the anomaly emerges naturally in the vector and
axial ward identities on the same footing as the four-dimensional case. the
vector gauge symmetry can be achieved by an appropriate choice of the mass
scales without introducing the seagull term. the necessity of a short-distance
expansion in the fourier transform into momentum space is emphasized.

one of the most remarkable dynamical phenomena in two-dimensional massless quan-
tum electrodynamics (qed2) is that the photon eld becomes massive through a dynami-
cal higgs mechanism induced by the fermions [1]. the essence for its occurrence lies in the

spontaneous breaking of the global chiral symmetry u(1)eu(1), u(1) and eu (1) denoting the

abelian group associated with the charge and chirality of the fermion, respectively. conse-
quently, the vacuum of this model can exhibit a doubly innite degeneracy characterized by
fermion number and chirality [2]. in particular, the degeneracy with respect to the chiral-
ity is analogous to that found in four dimensional quantum chromodynamics (qcd4) [3].
therefore, qed2 can serve as a laboratory for exploring the vacuum structure of qcd4,
which still remains a puzzle.

the two-dimensional chiral anomaly plays a crucial role in revealing this dynamical
behavour [2, 4]. its rst perturbative derivation was carried out long ago [5]. in the last
decade this anomaly has been re-investigated by various perturbative and non-perturbative
calculation techniques such as dimensional, pauli-villars and zeta function regularization
schemes as well as a dispersion relation approach [6] and topological analysis [7]. recently,
it is calculated again by a quite old method regularization called analytic regularization [8].
however, we think that it is still worthwhile to use newly developed quantum eld theory
methods to gain insight. this may not only reveal new features of the anomaly, but also
test the feasibility of the modern computation techniques.

in view of the above considerations, in this letter we shall use a relatively new regular-
ization scheme called dierential regularization [9] to calculate the two-dimensional chiral
anomaly. the basic idea of this regularization is quite simple. it works in coordinate space
for euclidean eld theory and is based on the observation that the higher order amplitude

1

cannot have a fourier transform into momentum space due to the short-distance singularity.
thus one can regulate such an amplitude by rst writing its singular parts as the derivatives
of the less singular functions, which have a well dened fourier transform, and then perform-
ing fourier transformation in partial integration and discarding the surface term. in this
way one can directly get the renormalized result. up to now this method has been applied
successfully to almost every eld theories, including the supersymmetric ones [915].

the main reason for us to adopt this regularization scheme to study the two-dimensional
chiral anomaly is its great advantage over other regularization schemes in preserving gauge
symmetry. the maintenance of the gauge symmetry in dierential regularization is achieved
by appropriately choosing the indenite renormalization scale at the nal stage of the calcu-
lation. therefore, this regularization method can provide a most democratic expression for
the chiral anomaly. in pauli-villars, dimensional and zeta function regularization, on the
other hand, a renormalization condition is already imposed on the vector and axial ward
identities when calculating the chiral anomaly. that is, these regularization schemes them-
selves are compatible with the conservation of vector gauge symmetry and violate the axial
vector symmetry, thus one can naturally get an anomalous axial vector ward identity. dif-
ferential regularization is dierent. the study of chiral anomaly was initially carried out in
ref. [9] and [12], and it was shown that the anomalous term can naturally arise in the vwi
and awi on the same footing. furthermore, combined with the conformal property of the
correlate function, as initially proposed by baker and johnson [16], dierential regularization
was used to investigate the possible two-loop radiative correction to the chiral anomaly [17]
and the gravitational axial anomaly. therefore, the investigation of the chiral anomaly in
terms of dierential regularization will denitely be more powerful in revealing the quantum
structure of the theory. in particular, dierential regularization does not modify the original
lagrangian at all, hence it never shifts the value of a primitively divergent feynman diagram
away from its singularities, and neither does it extend the dimensionality of the space-time
or introduce a regulator [12]. thus this regularization method is free from the ambiguity
in dening the dimensional continuation of 5 occurred in dimensional regularization. the
details of the calculation are also much more simple than in pauli-villars and zeta function
regularization.

we now set up the framework for calculating this anomaly. the lagrangian of qed2

with one avour fermion in euclidean space is read as follows [4]:

l = (i/  e/a  m) 

1
4

ff,

,  = 1, 2,

where the -matrices are chosen as the two-component form

1 = i1, 2 = i1, 5 = 21 = i3.

clearly

and

{, } = 2,

5 = .

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

classically, the following vector and axial currents

satisfy the identities

j = ,

 = 5
j5

j = 0, j5

 = 2imj5

with j5 being the pseudo-scalar current,

j5 5.

(5)

(6)

(7)

it is well known that the chiral anomaly in qed2 comes from the two-point function [7]

5

(x  y) = ht [j(x)j5

 (y)]i.

(8)

this is contrary to the four-dimensional case, where the chiral anomaly comes from the
triangle composed of the axial and vector currents. due to the relation (4), t 5
 is relevant
to the vacuum polarization tensor

5

(x  y) = (x  y).

(9)

thus we can get 5

 via the vacuum polarization tensor.

if the classical symmetries of the theory were preserved at the quantum level there would

exist the following vector ward identity (vwi),

x
5

(x  y) = x

(x  y) = y

 (x  y) = 0

and the corresponding axial vector one (awi),

 5
y

(x  y) = 2im5

(x  y)

with

5

(x  y)ht [j(x)j5(y)]i

(10)

(11)

(12)

the above naive ward identities can be written in the more familiar form in momentum
space,

p5

(p) = p(p) = p(p) = 0

and

pt 5

(p) = 2m5

(p).

in fact, due to the chiral anomaly, the above ward identities will be violated.

for massless qed2, the propagator of the fermion in euclidean space is

s(x) = 

1
2

/ ln

1
x

,

3

x|x|,

(13)

(14)

(15)

while for the massive case, we have

s(x) =

1
2

(/  m)k0(mx),

(16)

where k is the modied bessel function of the second kind. it it has the following asymp-
totical expansion near x0,

(17)

with  being the euler constant.

for simplicity we rst consider the massless case. in fact, the chiral anomaly is inde-
pendent of the fermionic mass, but for completeness we shall check the massive case later.
with the propagator (15) we write the vacuum polarization tensor

(x) = tr [s(x)s(x)] =

where we have used

f (x) =

the term proportional to xx can be rewritten as

(21)

upon substitution of (21) into the vacuum polarization tensor (18), it seems that the term
with the tensor structure  could cancel. in fact, this is not allowed since in two dimension
the term  1/x2 is obviously singular. it is analogous to the fact that two divergent terms
with the same form but opposite sign in momentum space cannot be canceled, only after
a regularization procedure is performed so that they become well dened, the substraction
operation can work. otherwise, a nite term will probably lost since the dierence of two
innite quantities is generally not zero. we therefore use dierential regularization schemes
to make 1/x2 well dened. writing

we get

eq.(28) explicitly shows that the vector ward identities are satised

while the axial ward identity becomes anomalous

eq.(32) clearly gives the two-dimensional chiral anomaly, which will results in the addition
of an anomalous term to the lagrangian (1)

(34)

furthermore, there appears no renormalization scale in (28). this implies that those two
current two-point functions are nite and hence coincide with the result obtained by other
approaches [7].

as in the four-dimensional case, (25) and (26) have displayed a most democratic expres-

sion for two-dimensional anomaly. choosing a general relation

we obtain the two-point functions

the choice n = 2 is just the case discussed above. the n = 0 case just corresponds to
the conservation of axial vector current but an anomalous vector current. in any case, the
vector and axial ward identities cannot both be fullled simultaneously.

the massive case can be calculated in a similar way. the vacuum polarization tensor is

(46)

with the choice (27) of the renormalization scale, it can be easily checked that the vector

ward identity is satised whereas the axial one becomes anomalous with the usual form,

the general choice (35) will yield a general form for the two-dimensional anomaly.

(48)

(49)

eq.(48) is the same as that obtained by dimensional regularization [7].

eqs.(26), (27) and the calculation deriving them show that the origin of the two-
dimensional anomaly is the same as in the four-dimensional case [12]. to regulate two
dierent singular pieces, one has to introduce two dierent mass scales. the terms with
these two mass scales actually can combine into a nite amplitude with a continuous one-
parameter shift degree of freedom given by the quotient of these two scales. this degree
of freedom cannot accommodate the vector and axial vector ward identities simultaneously
so that the two-dimensional chiral anomaly has to emerge and manifests itself in the vector
and axial vector ward identities on the same footing.

in summary, we have derived two-dimensional anomaly neatly in terms of dierential
regularization. compared with other approaches such as dimensional and pauli-villars reg-
ularization, this regularization scheme has exhibited clearly the origin of the chiral anomaly
and especially, the anomaly has manifested itself in the vector and axial ward identities

8

impartially. furthermore, the impartiality is achieved automatically in dierential regular-
ization and does not require an explicit particular choice of the renormalization conditions
on the physical amplitude as other regularization schemes [19]. this has not only demon-
strate the applicability of dierential regularization to two-dimensional gauge theory, but
also has revealed an intrinsic anomaly structure of the theory.

another point which should be emphasized is that we have overcome the diculty of the
gauge non-invariance of the two-point function of qed2 in coordinate space. it is known that
the vacuum polarization tensor calculated before in coordinate space is not gauge invariant,
a covariant seagull term has to be added to gain the gauge symmetry [20]. of course, the
reason for this is that the singularity is not properly regulated. here in the framework of
dierential regularization we have achieved the gauge invariance by a appropriate choice of
the mass scales.

finally, let us stress the necessity of utilizing the short-distance formula (29) to transform
the amplitude into momentum space. in the initial paper on dierential regularization, the
surface term usually has been thrown away, since in four-dimensional theory it contains
the divergent terms, the renormalization group equation can ensure the independence of
the physical amplitude on the renormalization scale even the nite terms are abandoned
accompanying the divergent ones. however, in low-dimensional eld theory such as three [14]
and two dimensions, the situation is dierent, the green function is usually uv nite, at least
at one-loop level. the beta function and the anomalous dimensions vanishes and hence the
renormalization group equation is trivial. the naive ignorance on the nite terms will result
in the nite renormalization ambiguity of the amplitude in momentum space, even violate
the gauge symmetry. therefore, it is indispensable to utilize the short-distance expansion
to keep all the nite terms.
