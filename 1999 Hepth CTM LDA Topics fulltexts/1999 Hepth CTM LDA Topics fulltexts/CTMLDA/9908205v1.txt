abstract

some physics models have 10 dimensions that are usually decom-

posed into:
4 spacetime dimensions with local lorentz spin(1, 3) symmetry
plus
a 6-dimensional compact space related to internal symmetries.

a possibly useful alternative decomposition is into:
6 spacetime dimensions with local conformal symmetry
of the conformal group c(1, 3) = spin(2, 4) = su (2, 2)
plus
a 4-dimensional compact internal symmetry space
that can be taken to be complex projective 2-space cp 2
which, since cp 2 = su (3)/u (2),
is a natural representation space for su (3)
and on which u (2) = su (2)  u (1) can be represented naturally by
local action.

1 decomposition of 10 dimensions

some physics models have 10 dimensions that are usually decomposed into:

4 spacetime dimensions with local lorentz spin(1, 3) symmetry

plus

a 6-dimensional compact space related to internal symmetries.

a possibly useful alternative decomposition is into:

6 spacetime dimensions with local c(1, 3) = spin(2, 4) = su(2, 2) con-

formal symmetry.

plus

a 4-dimensional compact internal symmetry space.

1.1

6-dimensional conformal spacetime

conformal symmetries and some of their physical applications are described
in the book of barut and raczka [1].

the conformal group c(1, 3) of minkowski spacetime is the group su(2, 2) =

spin(2, 4). as spin(2, 4), the conformal group acts on a 6-dimensional (2,4)-
space that is related to the 6-dimensional cp 3 space of penrose twistors [2].

it is reasonable to consider the 6-dimensional conformal space as the
spacetime in the dimensional decomposition of 10-dimensional models be-
cause conformal symmetry is consistent with such physics structures as:

maxwells equations of electromagnetism;

2

the quantum theoretical hydrogen atom;

the canonical dirac lagrangian for massive fermions, as shown by liu,

ma, and hou [3];

gravity derived from the conformal group using the macdowell-mansouri

mechanism, as described by mohapatra [4];

the lie sphere geometry of spacetime correlations; and

the conformal physics model of i. e. segal [5].

1.2

4-dimensional internal symmetry space

an example of a possibly useful 4-dimensional compact internal symmetry
space is complex projective 2-space cp 2.

since cp 2 = su(3)/u(2), it is a natural representation space for su(3).

further, u(2) = su(2)  u(1) can be represented naturally on cp 2 =

su(3)/u(2) as a local action.

therefore, all three of the gauge groups of the standard model su(3) 
su(2)  u(1) can be represented on the 4-dimensional compact internal
symmetry space cp 2 = su(3)/u(2).

the following section lists some examples of physics models that have
such 10-dimensional spaces: superstring theory; the division algebra model
of georey dixon; and the d4  d5  e6  e7 physics model.

2 superstrings, dixon, and d4-d5-e6-e7

2.1 superstrings

the 10-dimensional space of superstring theory is well known, and described
in many references, so i will not try to summarize it here. one particularly
current and thorough reference is the 2-volume work of polchinski [6].

2.2 georey dixons division algebra model

georey dixon, in his publications and website [7], considers the real division
algebras:
the real numbers r;
the complex numbers c;
the quaternions q; and
the octonions o.

dixon then forms the tensor product t = r  c  q  o and considers

the 64-real-dimensional space t.

then dixon takes the left-adjoint actions tl = cl  ql  ol, and notes

that tl is isomorphic to c(16) = cl(0, 9) = c  cl(0, 8).

then dixon considers the algebra t to be the spinor space of tl.

then dixon forms a matrix algebra tl(2) as the 2  2 matrices whose
elements are in the left-action adjoint matrix algebra tl and notes that
tl(2) is isomorphic to c(32) = c  cl(1, 9).

dixon describes the matrices tl(2) as having spinor space t  t and

c  cl(1, 9) as the dirac algebra of 10-dimensional (1,9)-space.

dixon then describes leptons and quarks in terms of reduction of the
dirac spinors of the 10-dimensional (1,9)-space to the dirac spinors of a

4

4-dimensional (1,3)-spacetime.

the right-action adjoint matrix algebra tr is not the same as the left-
action adjoint tl, because, although cr = cl and or = ol, it is a fact
that qr 6= ql (they are isomorphic but not identical).

since qr = q, the part of the matrix algebra tr that diers from tl
is just q, and the dierent part of the 2  2 matrix algebra tr(2) is just the
2  2 matrix algebra with quaternion entries q(2).

in section 6.7 of his book [7], dixon shows that commutator closure of
the set of traceless 2  2 matrices over the quaternions q, which he denotes
by sl(2, q), is the lie algebra of spin(1, 5).

since the lie algebra spin(1, 5) is just the lie algebra of the conformal

group c(1, 3) = spin(2, 4) = su(2, 2) with a dierent signature,

i conjecture that it might be useful to consider the spacetime part of
dixons 10-dimensional (1,9)-space to be the 6-dimensional (1,5)-spacetime
of spin(1, 5).

that would leave a 4-dimensional (0,4)-space to be used as an internal

symmetry space.

2.3

the d4-d5-e6-e7 model

the d5 lie algebra of the d4  d5  e6  e7 physics model corresponds
(with conformal signature) to the lie algebra spin(2, 8) of the cliord al-
gebra cl(2, 8) whose vector space is 10-dimensional.

as the d4  d5  e6  e7 physics model is described on the web [8], i

will not try to summarize it here.

the idea of 6-dimenisonal spacetime with conformal symmetry was moti-
vated by the works of i. e. segal [5] and by e-mail conversations with robert
neil boyd.

the idea of 4-dimensional internal symmetry space was motivated by
cayley calibrations of octonions [9] and by e-mail conversations with matti
pitkanen.
