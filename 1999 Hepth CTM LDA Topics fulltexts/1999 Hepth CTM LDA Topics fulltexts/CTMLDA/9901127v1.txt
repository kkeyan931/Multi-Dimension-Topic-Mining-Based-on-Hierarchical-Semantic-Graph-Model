abstract

we describe a class of dieomorphism invariant su (n ) gauge theories in
n 2 dimensions, together with some matter couplings. these theories have
(n 2  3)(n 2  1) local degrees of freedom, and have the unusual feature that
the constraint associated with time reparametrizations is identically satised.
a related class of su (n ) theories in n 21 dimensions has the constraint alge-
bra of general relativity, but has more degrees of freedom. non-perturbative
quantization of the rst type of theory via su (n ) spin networks is briey
outlined.

generally covariant theories have the well known feature that their hamiltonia are linear
combinations of constraints in the canonical formulation. the poisson algebra of constraints
in the hamiltonian theory normally reects all the spacetime symmetries of the covariant
theory. this is the case in theories such as general relativity and supergravity, in which
the spacetime metric is non-degenerate in general. the constraint associated with time
reparametrization plays a dual role: it may be viewed as generating both unphysical gauge
transformations on phase space variables because of its origin, and physical time-evolution
because it gives the rule for evolving initial data from one spatial surface to the next. a
true non-vanishing hamiltonian appears only after a time gauge xing is made; physical
evolution is then unambiguous, but is with respect to the gauge choice.

the normal expectation is that all local invariances of an action are manifested in the
hamiltonian theory via distinct rst class constraints. however there are two known excep-
tions.

the rst is a theory with general coordinate and su(2) yang-mills invariance in four
spacetime dimensions [1]. the elds are spacetime dreibeins ei
a, where
a = 0,    , 3 is the spacetime index and i = 1,    , 3 is the su(2) index. the elds are
therefore in the adjoint representation. the action is

a and gauge elds ai

s4[e, a] = z ijk ei  ej  f k(a),

(1)

where f (a) = da + [a, a] is the curvature of ai
a, and ijk is the su(2) anti-symmetric
tensor. this theory has been analyzed in detail in [1]. the phase space coordinates are
exactly those of su(2) yang-mills theory. however, the dynamics is (obviously) dierent:
the hamiltonian turns out to be a linear combination of the gauss law and spatial dieomor-
phism constraint. the surprising feature of this theory is that the constraint corresponding
to time reparametrization invariance vanishes identically.

the second theory is a generalization of chern-simons theory to all odd dimensions
higher than three. the action is again invariant under general coordinate and yang-mills
gauge transformations, but unlike (1), is a functional of a single gauge eld [2,3]. the
lagrangian l for the (2n + 1)-dimensional theory is dened via

dl2n+1 = gi1 in+1f i1      f in+1,

(2)

where now the gauge group may be su(n) rather than just su(2) as in (1), and gi1 in+1
is a symmetric lie algebra tensor of rank n + 1 constructed from the structure constants.
for n > 2 these theories have local degrees of freedom. the hamiltonian-dirac analysis
reveals the feature that the time-reparametrization constraint arises as a linear combination
of internal yang-mills transformations and spatial dieomorphisms: there is no independent
time dieomorphism constraint [2].

one of the main dierences between these two theories at the hamiltonian level is that in
the rst there is no combination of rst class constraints that gives the time dieomorphism
constraint, while in the second this is the case. furthermore, the phase space coordinates
themselves are dierent: the coordinates for the second theory are spatial components of the
gauge eld as is usual for chern-simons theory, rather than electric and connection elds
as in the rst theory. finally, while (2) is dened in all odd dimensions, it appears at rst
sight that (1) can be dened only in four dimensions, and only for su(2). indeed, if the

2

group is taken to be so(3,1), (1) is an action for general relativity. for groups with more
than three generators (in four spacetime dimensions), the time dieomorphism constraint is
always present in the hamiltonian formulation.

in this note we point out that there are in fact higher dimensional theories of the general
form (1). we will see that this type of action, with the vanishing hamiltonian constraint
property, may be written down only for spacetime dimensions which are specic functions
of the number of generators of the internal group. the vanishing hamiltonian constraint
means that dynamics eectively amounts to the kinematics of general relativity in the
respective dimensions. this makes the theories integrable quantum mechanically, as is the
case [4] for the su(2) theory (1). finally, we discuss possible matter couplings, and point
out that there is another class of su(n) gauge theory in n 2  1 dimensions which has
a canonical constraint algebra identical to the 4-dimensional general relativity constraint
algebra in the ashtekar formulation. this theory, however, has more degrees of freedom
than general relativity in the same dimension. this demonstrates that identical constraint
algebras need not imply identical theories classically or quantum mechanically.

aej

the key input responsible for the absence of the hamiltonian constraint in the theory
(1) is that the 4-dimensional action is a functional of drei-beins ei
a. this means that the
spacetime metric gab = ei
bij is degenerate with signature (0 + ++). one can attempt
to formulate similar higher dimensional theories with degenerate metrics. for example, for
a 5-dimensional theory we would like to have a degenerate covariant metric of signature
(0 + + + +), and might try so(4) (or so(3, 1) etc.) as the internal gauge group. however,
this does not work because there is no way to form a gauge scalar lagrangian density of the
desired type: the anti-symmetric tensor on the group is the levi-civita tensor ijkl, whereas
the would be 5-form lagrangian density is

ei  ej  ek  f lm.

(3)

thus tracing of internal indices, for group so(4), isnt possible. the same problem occurs
for all higher dimensions with so(n) groups.

for su(n) groups, however, it is possible to write down higher dimensional actions of the
form (1) because the gauge eld carries one internal index rather than an antisymmetrized
pair as for so(n). but now the requirement that the spacetime metric be degenerate is
possible only in certain dimensions. to see this consider su(3) as an example: the eld ei
a
(i = 1,    , 8) gives a degenerate metric via gab = ei
bkij (where kij is the cartan metric),
only if the spacetime dimension is nine.

aej

more generally it is possible to write down degenerate metric theories of this type with

internal gauge group su(n) only if the spacetime dimension is n 2. the action is

is a tensor of rank n 2  1 on the lie algebra. this tensor has an antisymmetric part propor-
tional to the internal levi-civita tensor. (i1,    , in 21 are su(n) indices, and f i
jk are the

3

structure constants). like (1), this action is invariant under all general coordinate transfor-
mations, and under the yang-mills gauge transformations ei = f i
jkejk and ai = di,
where d is the covariant derivative of a.

to study the dynamics further let us consider the hamiltonian formulation of the action
(4). assuming that the n 2 dimensional manifold is m =   r where  is a compact space,
choose coordinates (x0, xa) on m such that x0  r, and the t = constant surfaces are slices
with the topology of . let

this is the desired hamiltonian action. the indices a are now associated with  and the
phase space variables are the pairs (ai

n a gives the constraints

a, ea

gi = 0

and

ha = 0.

(14)

the hamiltonian is a linear combination of constraints as expected for a generally covariant
theory. however, as is manifest, there is no constraint corresponding to time reparametriza-
tion invariance. this feature is also present in the 4-dimensional theory studied in ref. [1].

4

the two sets of constraints (12) and (13) are rst class and, as expected, generate respec-
tively yang-mills and spatial dieormorphisms on the phase space variables. these are the
kinematical constraints in the ashtekar canonical variables [5].

since there are (n 2  1)2 conguration degrees of freedom ai

a, and 2(n 2  1) rst class

constraints per space point, the theory has

(n 2  1)(n 2  3)

(15)

local degrees of freedom. this is signicantly more than the n 2(n 2  3)/2 of local degrees
of freedom of general relativity in n 2 spacetime dimensions.

the result that the hamiltonian constraint is identically zero in this theory may be
understood from the covariant point of view. recall that the hamiltonian constraint of
general relativity arises as the projection of the eld equations along a timelike direction.
in the present case the vector density

we will now show that the projection of the covariant eld equations along this direction

vanishes identically. varying (4) with respect to ei

a and projecting along ua gives

where f i

finally, with fi1 in 2

now fi1 in 2

fi1 in 2
u vanishes identically. the same result holds for the other equation of motion

2j is antisymmetric in the rst n 2  2 indices by denition. however, it must
(19) to hold. this means that
ab ub  0. thus, the projection of this equation of motion along

2j  0, and hence f i

2 = 0.

(20)

the vanishing of these projections is the covariant reason that the hamiltonian constraint
is absent, or more precisely, identically satised, in the canonical theory.

the 4-dimensional theory [1] has been completely quantized via a lattice method [4].
in this approach, holonomies of the connection in various representations (colors) of su(2)
are associated with the edges of a graph embedded in . from this collection of holonmies,
gauss law invariant states are constructed by forming gauge scalars by summing over group
indices using intertwining matrices (6  j, 9  j, symbols etc.), which are associated with
the nodes of the graph. this means that the colors which meet at a node must be compatible

5

with the usual angular momentum addition rules. this procedure gives the so called spin-
network states [6,7]. thus, the links of the graph carry colors, and the nodes carry group
index contraction information. finally, spatial dieomorphism invariant states are formed by
summing over the dieomorphism group. in the nal picture, this eectively amounts to
the labelling of physical states by quantities associated with the equivalence classes of graphs
under spatial dieomorphisms. the dieomorphism invariant information labelling graph
states consists of group representations associated with the edges, and intertwining matrices
associated with the nodes of a graph. this is what is expected intuitvely: diemorphisms
cannot break up, recolor, and resum the edges of graphs, or alter the intertwining matrices.
an exactly analagous treatment of the higher dimensional theories discussed above is pos-
sible. the only real dierence is the replacement of su(2) by su(n), and the corresponding
replacement of gauss law invariant states by su(n) spin-networks. the construction of dif-
feomorphism invariant states remains unaltered.

it is possible to couple matter elds to the action (4). since an invertible metric is not
available, the coupling is unusual. nevertheless it has the property that a matter current
appears with the spatial dieormorphism constraint in the canonical theory in the expected
way.

scalar eld coupling is achieved by adding to the action the term [8]

s[e, , ] = zm

dn 2

x uaa,

(21)

where ua is given by eqn. (16). the momentum conjugate to  is  = u0, and the the
dieomorphism constraint has the additional piece a.

there is a similar coupling to a doublet i and i of su(n) matter elds, obtained by

adding to the action (4) the term

s[a, e; , ] = zm

dn 2

x uakijidaj,

(22)

where d is the covaraint derivative of a. the momentum conjugate to i is p i
now the gauss law also acquires a source term f i

finally, a coupling to rarita-schwinger su(n) elds (i

achieved with the term

s[e, a; , ] = zm

(23)

this is similar to a coupling to two component spinors introduced for the su(2) theory [9].
quantization of the four-dimensional su(2) theory with matter couplings has been dis-
cussed [10,11]. for the case of scalar and su(n) spinors, it is evident that a similar approach
will work in higher dimensions. for the rarita-schwinger type elds, however, a generaliza-
tion would be necessary because of the spatial indices carried by these elds.

so far we have discussed a theory similar to (1), but in higher dimensions, which does
not have the hamiltonian constraint in its canonical formulation. it is possible to add this
constraint by hand to the hamiltonian theory given above. it has the form

i eb
ea

abf ij

k = 0,

(24)

which is identical to that for gravity in four dimensions in the ashtekar variables. the
constraint algebra remains rst class, and is identical to the four dimensional case.

although adding the constraint (24) by hand does give a classically consistent system,
there are in fact higher dimensional su(n) actions for which this can be achieved directly.
consider the action

(25)

this is similar to (4), but with the dierences that the lagrangian density is an (n 2  1)
form and i1 in 22 is an antisymmetric tensor of rank n 2  2. the metric is now no longer
degenerate since there are (n 2  1) elds ei
a, in the same number of dimensions. for n = 2,
i1i2 = f k0
i2k0 = ki1i2 is the cartan metric, and (25) is just the action of 3-dimensional
gravity.

being rst order in derivatives, it is straightforward to construct the hamiltonian version
of this theory. the canonical theory does contain the time dieomorphism constraint (24).

(28)

noting that ai

spatial dieomorphism constraint. to extract the hamiltonian constraint in the form (24),
we must contract the free index i in eqn. (26) to get a scalar density. this is achieved by
contracting (26) with

and simplifying.

finally, note that although the algebra of constraints of this su(n) theory is identical
to that for four dimensional general relativity, it has more degrees of freedom than the
latter. there are of course rst order actions for general relativity of exactly the form (25),
and therefore with a hamiltonian constraint, for gauge group so(n  1, 1). however their
canonical formulations are no simpler than the usual metric variables due to the presence
of second class constraints [12]. the point of the su(n) action in the relevant dimension
is that the canonical theory has exactly the same constraints and algebra as the inherently
four-dimensional ashtekar variables.

7

in summary, we have made the following observations: (i) there are dieomorphism
invariant su(n) gauge theories in n 2 dimensions such that their hamiltonian versions do
not have a time reparametrization constraint, (ii) although the metric is degenerate, there
is a prescription for matter couplings, (iii) full quantization along the lines of [4] seems
possible, and, (iv) in n 2  1 dimensions, there are su(n) theories which have the canonical
constraint algebra of general relativity, but have more degrees of freedom than the latter
theory in the same dimensions.
