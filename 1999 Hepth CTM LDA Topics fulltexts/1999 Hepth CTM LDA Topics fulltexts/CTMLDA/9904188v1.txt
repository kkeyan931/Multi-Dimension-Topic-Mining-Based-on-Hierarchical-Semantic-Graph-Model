abstract

we construct a new class of two-dimensional eld theories with target spaces that are
nite multiparameter deformations of the usual coset g/h-spaces. they arise naturally,
when certain models, related by poissonlie t-duality, develop a local gauge invariance
at specic points of their classical moduli space. we show that canonical equivalences
in this context can be formulated in loop space in terms of parafermionic-type algebras
with a central extension. we nd that the corresponding generating functionals are non-
polynomial in the derivatives of the elds with respect to the space-like variable. after
constructing models with three- and two-dimensional targets, we study renormalization
group ows in this context.
in the ultraviolet, in some cases, the target space of the
theory reduces to a coset space or there is a xed point where the theory becomes free.

1 introduction

cosets g/h as target spaces in 2-dim eld theories have been extensively studied in
the literature, as they provide examples of spaces other than group manifolds, which
give rise to integrable models.1 it is always of interest to nd integrable deformations
[9][11] of such models and if possible classify them. in the ordinary (undeformed) coset
models one starts with the usual wesszumino action for a group, with lagrangian
density proportional to tr(ig1ig), and then restricts the trace to the coset space only.
hence, this construction, but not the corresponding models, is quite trivial. having in
mind 2-dim eld theories, with targets spaces representing continuous deformations of
the latter coset spaces, we need models with non-trivial moduli as a starting point. such
an example was considered in [12]; we present in this paper the generalization of this to
a class of theories.

we found natural to start, in section 2, with 2-dim models related by poissonlie
t-duality [13], since these have indeed a non-trivial moduli space and, moreover, their
classical equivalence has been established [14, 15]. also, in some examples, there are
hints that point towards the classical equivalence promoted into a quantum one at 1-loop
in perturbation theory [12, 16]. we will show that in some points in this moduli space a
local (gauge-like) invariance is developing. hence, at these points the conguration space
is lower-dimensional and we discover in a unifying manner spaces that are deformations
of the usual coset spaces.
in addition, as a byproduct, we will obtain duals of these
models that are classically canonically equivalent to them as 2-dim eld theories. this
equivalence is encoded in innite-dimensional current algebras of the parafermionic type
that we construct. we derive these from the innite-dimensional algebras with a central
extension, which were found in the proof of canonical equivalence of the poissonlie
t-duality-related models in [15]. the corresponding generating functionals have the new
feature that they are not linear in the derivatives of the elds with respect to the space-like
variable. this is in contrast with the cases of abelian duality [17], non-abelian duality in
principal criral [18, 19] and more general [20] models, as well as for poissonlie t-duality
(and its possible generalizations) [15, 12]. they are, instead, non-polynomial functions
of these derivatives. many of these aspects are explicitly demonstrated in section 3, with
a particular example. in section 4 we discuss the renormalization group (rg) ow in
this context. as in [12], we emphasize that taking the classical limit that leads to the
lower-dimensional models and then studying the rg ow does not necessarily imply that
this limit would correspond to a xed point of the rg ow, i.e. the two procedures do not
commute. there is, however, a particular domain in parameter space, where for a wide

1examples include the o(n ) [1], the principal chiral [2] and the grossneveu models [3], for which
the complete s-matrix was found through the existence of higher-spin-conserved currents that lead to
its factorization property. building on work in [4], comparison between the s-matrix results and those
obtained by perturbative techniques in the ultraviolet (uv) regime was made for the o(n ) -model [5],
the principal chiral models for su (n ) [6], so(n ) and sp(n ) [7] and the o(n ) grossneveu model
[8], nding perfect agreement.

range of energies in the uv, the description is eectively perturbative with a uv-stable
xed point corresponding to the point where the gauge invariance develops. then the
model becomes eectively a two-dimensional one.

we end the paper with section 5, containing concluding remarks and a discussion
on future directions of this research. we have also written an appendix, where some
mathematical aspects of our proofs are worked out explicitly.

2 general formulation

in this section we rst show how new 2-dim eld theories, with target spaces representing
deformed coset spaces, arise in the context of poissonlie t-duality-related -models.
we then present a duality-invariant formulation and show that canonical equivalences
are encoded into algebras of the parafermionic-type in loop space.

2.1 formulation using poissonlie t-duality-related -models

the form of 2-dim -model actions related by poissonlie t-duality (in the absence of
spectator elds) is [13]

and

s =

s =

1

1

m lb

n +x m x n ,

2 z eabla
2 z eab lam lbn + x m  x n ,

e = (e 1

0 + )1 ,

e = (e0 + )1 .

(2.1)

(2.2)

the eld variables in (2.1) are x m ,  = 1, 2, . . . , dg and parametrize an element g of a
group g. we also introduce representation matrices {ta}, with a = 1, 2, . . . , dg and the
components of the left-invariant maurercartan forms la
m . the light-cone coordinates on
the 2-dim space-time are x = 1
2(t x), whereas  denotes the overall coupling constant,
which is assumed to be positive. similarly, for (2.2) the eld variables are x m , where x ,
 = 1, 2, . . . , dg, parametrize a dierent group g, whose dimension is, however, equal to
that of g. accordingly, we introduce a dierent set of representation matrices { t a}, with
a = 1, 2, . . . , dg, and the corresponding components of the left-invariant maurercartan
forms lam . in (2.1) and (2.2), e0 is a constant dg  dg matrix, whereas  and  are
antisymmetric matrices with the same dimension as e0, but they depend on the variables
x m and x m via the corresponding group elements g and g. they are dened as [13]

ab = bcaac

b ,

ab = bcaac

b ,

where the matrices a(g), b(g) are constructed using

g1tag = aa

btb ,

g1 t ag = babtb + (a1)b

a t b ,

and similarly for a(g) and b(g). consistency restricts these to obey

a(g1) = a1(g) ,

bt (g) = b(g1) ,

t (g) = (g) ,

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

2

and similarly for the tilded ones. there is also a bilinear invariant h|i with the various
generators obeying

hta|tbi = h t a| t bi = 0 ,

hta| t bi = a

b .

(2.6)

finally, we note that the choice of possible groups g and g is restricted by the fact that
[13] their corresponding lie algebras must form a pair of maximally isotropic subalgebras
into which the lie algebra of a larger group d, known as the drinfeld double, can be
decomposed [21].

let us consider two subgroups h  g and h  g with dh = d h. accordingly we split
the lie-algebra indices as a = (a, ), where latin and greek indices refer to subgroup
and coset spaces, respectively. then we may separate the various matrices appearing in
(2.1) and (2.2) into blocks as

(e 1

0 )ab =   eab

0
eb
3

ea
2
e

1 ! ,

and

ab =   ab
b

0

a
2
2 

1 ! ,

ab =   ( 0)ab
( 2)b

( 2)a
( 1)! .

(2.7)

(2.8)

we would like to take a limit in the model (2.1) and its dual (2.2) such that the number
of elds x m (and x m ) is reduced by dh. we would call the remaining variables by x 
(and x ) with  = 1, 2, . . . , dg/h. consider the limit

eab
0    (e 1

0 )ab  0 ,

(2.9)

in a uniform way for all matrix elements. this means that ratios of matrix elements
remain constant in this limit. using (2.7) we nd that in the limit (2.9)

e0    0

0
0 e 1

1 ! .

then, the actions (2.1) and (2.2) take the form

s =

and

1

2 z l
l

 +x x  ,

(2.10)

 = (e1 + 1)1 ,

(2.11)

s =

2 z ab la lb+ x  x  ,

 2 e 1

1 + 1!1

.

(2.12)

notice that in (2.11)  are elements of a dg/h  dg/h matrix, whereas in (2.12) ab
are elements of a dgdg one. we have anticipated that the number of variables in (2.11)
and (2.12) has been reduced to dg/h upon taking the limit (2.9). however, this does not
happen automatically, but depends on whether or not certain conditions, as we will next
prove, are fullled. in order to reduce the dimensionality of (2.1) we should prove that,

3

after taking the limit (2.9), a local gauge invariance develops, which suces to gauge-x
dh degrees of freedom in the actions (2.1) and similarly for (2.2). for (2.1) consider the
transformation

g  gh ,

h(x+, x)  h .

(2.13)

in its innitesimal form it reads g = igat a. we may show that this induces the
following transformations:

l

 = fb

bl

 ,

x m = lm

a a .

using these and the relation (a.6) of [15], specialized for coset space indices2

a m 
lm

1 =  f 

a  fa

[]
1

,

(2.14)

(2.15)

we may prove that (2.11) is invariant under the gauge transformation (2.13), provided
that the following condition holds:

f 

c + fc

e

1 + fc

e

1 = 0 ,

or equivalently

fc

(s) = 0 ,

f 

c + fc

[a] = 0 ,

(2.16)

(2.17)

where we have denoted by s and a the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the
matrix e
1 . when the conditions (2.16) are satised then we may gauge-x dh param-
eters in the group element g  g. the most ecient way is to parametrize the group
element g  g as g = h, where h  h and   g/h, and then set h = i. it can be
easily seen that this completely xes the gauge freedom.

there are d2

g/hdh algebraic conditions in (2.16) for the d2

g/h elements of the matrix
e1. hence, it is not at all obvious that they can be fullled for a general drinfeld double
and then for any arbitrary choice of the subgroup h  g. an obvious simplication
occurs when g is an abelian group. then ab = 0, f ab
(2.16) is
solved by e
1  . then (2.11) with    takes the form of the usual -model
action on the coset g/h space. accordingly (2.12) represents its usual non-abelian dual.
hence, when both groups g and g are non-abelian, the models (2.11) and (2.12) are
deformations of the usual models on coset spaces g/h and of their non-abelian duals.

c = 0 and eq.

2.2 duality-invariant formulation

we would like to nd a duality-invariant action, from which the -models (2.11) and
(2.12) originate. it is natural to start with the manifestly poissonlie t-duality-invariant
action of [22] from which the -models (2.1) and (2.2) originate. this action is dened
in the drinfeld double as [22],

s(l) = i0(l) +

1

2 z dxdthl1xl|r|l1xli ,

(2.18)

2our symmetrization and antisymmetrization conventions are (ab) = ab + ba and [ab] = ab  ba.

4

where i0(l) is the wzw action for a group element l  d. the operator r is dened as
[22]

r = |r+

aiabhr+

b| + |r

aiabhr
b| ,

with

a = ta  (e
r

0 )ab t b ,

ab = (e+

0 )ab + (e

0 )ab ,

(2.19)

(2.20)

where we have used the notation e+

0 = e0 and e

0 = et

0 . in the limit (2.9) we have

  r

a
r

 !   

ta
t  (e
1 )1


t ! .

(2.21)

using this and the conditions (2.16), one can show that (2.18), in the limit (2.9), develops
the gauge invariance

provided that the following constraint is obeyed

l  lh ,

h(t, x)  h ,

hl1xl|tai = 0 ,

 ta .

(2.22)

(2.23)

in order to avoid introducing this constraint we may use gauge elds instead. indeed,
consider the action

s(l, at) = i0(l) +

1

2 z hl1xl|rg/h|l1xli 

1

 z hl1xl|ati ,

(2.24)

where at takes values in the lie algebra of h, i.e. at = aa
dened as the restriction in g/h of the corresponding operator in (2.20)

t ta. the operator rg/h is

rg/h = |r+

i

1 hr+

where

r

(1) = (e+

 ,

(2.25)

(2.26)

and 
1
under (2.22) and the corresponding transformation for the gauge eld

is the inverse matrix of (1). it can be shown that (2.24) is gauge-invariant

at  h1(at  t)h ,

provided that rg/h is invariant under the similarity transformation

in order to prove (2.28) we rst show that

hrg/hh1 = rg/h .

(2.27)

(2.28)

 h1 = 


(h)r

(h)

(2.29)

for some h-dependent matrix 

tion we nd that such a matrix exists and is given by

. after repeatedly using (2.4) and a lengthy computa-




(h) = (e

(e

(h) ,

provided that the following condition holds:3

a

(h)

(h)(e

(2.30)

(2.31)

or equivalently, splitting into the symmetric and antisymmetric parts,



(h)

(h)s = s ,



(h)

(h)a = a + (h) .

(2.32)

at rst sight it seems that (2.31) is more restrictive than the corresponding conditions
in (2.16), since, unlike (2.16), they are valid for nite-gauge transformations. however,
we show in the appendix that (2.16) actually implies (2.31).

in the remainder of this subsection, we consider the classical equations of motion for
the (manifestly) duality and gauge-invariant action (2.24). its variation with respect to
all elds is

s(l, at) = 

1

 z (l1xl)(cid:16)l1tl  rg/hl1xl + at(cid:17) + atl1xl .

specializing to subgroup and coset space indices, we nd the equations of motion

(l1xl)

at

:

:

hl1l|r
i = 0 ,
hl1xl|tai = 0 ,

hl1tl|tai = 0 ,

(2.33)

(2.34)

where we have used also the fact that, because of (2.6), hat|tai = 0. hence, the constraint
(2.23) follows as the equation of motion for at. using (2.21), the equations of motion
in (2.34) can be cast into the form hl1l|r
ai = 0. these have the same form as the
equations of motion for the action (2.18) [22].

we nally note that the action (2.18) is manifestly invariant under the transformation
l  l0(t)l for some t-dependent group element l0  d [22]. by introducing gauge elds
this symmetry can be promoted into a gauge symmetry with l0 a function of t and x.
this type of gauge invariance, though interesting enough in its own right to be further
investigated, has no apparent relation to the one we have just discussed.

2.3 the canonical transformation

poissonlie t-duality-related models are canonically equivalent under the transformation
[14, 15]

p a = j a ,

ja = pa ,

j a = la

x + abpb ,

ja = lxa + ab p b .

(2.35)

3the various algebraic manipulations are facilitated by the fact that matrix elements a(h)a

b and

b(h)ab vanish if their indices are not both greek or latin.

6

this transformation preserves the equal-time poisson brackets of the conjugate pairs of
variables (j a, pa) and ( ja, p a) given by [15]4
cj c(xy) ,
cpc(xy) ,

{j a, j b} = f ab

where (x y) is the antisymmetric step function that equals +1(1) for x > y (x <
0). notice that the above poisson brackets are independent of the details of the -
models related by poissonlie t-duality. they are simply the central extensions, in
loop space, of the usual lie-(bi-)algebras dened in the drinfeld double. one may also
show that the hamiltonians of the two dual actions (2.1) and (2.2) are equal [14] as
required for canonical transformation with no explicit t-dependence. after some algebraic
manipulations, these hamiltonians can be written as

h =

where g0 and b0 are the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of e+
and b0 are the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of (e+
0 )1.5 notice that in the limit
(2.9) the conjugate momenta pa vanish. this is consistent with the development of a
local gauge invariance (2.13). at the level of the poisson brackets the vanishing of pa,
together with its conjugate j a, has to be imposed as a constraint. in fact they form a set
a = (pa, j a) of second-class constraints. we may see that in the limit (2.9) and upon
using (2.17), the hamiltonians (2.38) and (2.39) reduce to

(2.39)

hg/h =

2

spp + (s 1a)

j p ,

(2.41)

4we will not display explicitly the 2-dim space-time dependence of the phase-space variables involved
in the various poisson brackets. it is understood that the rst one in the bracket is always evaluated
at x and the second one at y, whereas the t-dependence is common. also, compared with [15], we have
restored in the various poisson brackets the dependence on the scale .

5the proof that h = h uses the fact that

g1
0 = g0  b0g1

0 b0 ,

b0 g1

0 = g1

0 b0 ,

(2.40)

as well as the similar expressions obtained by interchanging tilded and untilded symbols.

and

hg/h =

s j j +

(2.42)

we may show, with the help of (2.36) and (2.37), that {hg/h, pa} = {hg/h, j a}  0
(weakly). hence, no new constraints are generated by the time t-evolution.

in general (see, for instance, [23]), in the presence of a set of second-class constraints
{a}, one computes the antisymmetric matrix associated with their poisson brackets
dab = {a, b}. when dab is invertible one simply postulates that the usual poisson
brackets are replaced by dirac brackets, dened as

notice the parafermionic character of this algebra,6 which is encoded in the terms con-

of exact conformal eld theories corresponding to gauged wzw models.

by replacing untilded symbols by tilded ones and vice versa. it is instructive to write

3 an explicit example

in this section we explicitly demonstrate many of the general aspects developed in section
2, using 3- and 2-dim models related by poissonlie t-duality. that includes the explicit
construction of the metric and antisymmetric tensor elds, of the dirac-bracket algebra
for canonical equivalence, and also of the corresponding generating functional.

3.1 the drinfeld double

our example will be based on the 6-dim drinfeld double considered in [12, 16, 25],
which we rst review by following [12].7 it is just the non-compact group so(3, 1) with
g = su(2) and dual g = e3 = solv(so(3, 1)) given by the iwasawa decomposition of
so(3, 1) [26]. the associated 3-dim algebras su(2) and e3 have generators denoted by
{ta} and { t a}, where a = 1, 2, 3. leaving aside the details we only present the elements
that are necessary in this paper. it is convenient to split the index a = (3, ),  = 1, 2.
the non-vanishing structure constants for the algebras su(2) and e3 are

f

3 = f3

(3.1)

where our normalization is such that 12 = 11 = 1. we parametrize the su(2) group
element in terms of the three euler angles ,  and . it is represented by the 4  4
block-diagonal matrix

7recently, a classication was made of all possible drinfeld doubles based on the 3-dim real lie
algebras (bianchi algebras) [27]. it will be interesting to use them for the construction of more examples
that could be useful for the investigation of various issues presented in this and the following section.

3.2 explicit three- and two-dimensional models

consider the -model action (2.1) for the case of our double based on so(3, 1). let us
single-out the 1-dim subgroup h  u(1) that is generated by t3. for our purposes it

where we have kept the conventions of (2.7) for the enumeration of the matrix elements.
using (3.6), (3.8) and (3.10), it is the easy to compute the metric and antisymmetric
tensor elds corresponding to (2.1). we nd a metric given by

ds2 =

v (cid:18)(l1)2 + (l2)2 + (g + 1)(l3)2 +

1 + g

v  a2 + (b  cos )2 + (1 + g) sin2  .

(3.12)

(3.13)

notice that the antisymmetric tensor can be (locally) gauged away since the correspond-
ing 3-form eld strength is zero. also, for our purposes, we will not need the explicit
expressions for the metric and antisymmetric tensor corresponding to the dual -model
(2.2). for b = 1, but general a and g, the above example (with its dual) was considered
in [12] (also in [16] for a = b = 1 and g = 0).

we would like to take the analogue of the limit (2.9). it is clear that in our case this
corresponds to letting g  1. comparing (3.10) to (2.7) we see that the 2  2 matrix
e1 is

it is easily seen that this is the most general 22 matrix that solves (2.16), with structure
constants given by (3.1). in agreement with our general discussion, the -model action
with metric (3.11) and antisymmetric tensor (3.12) develops a local invariance under the
transformation

this allows to gauge-x the variable  = 0. explicitly computing (2.11) we nd that the
metric and antisymmetric tensors are given by

 = (t, x) .

(3.15)

ds2 =

b = 2

a

a2 + (b  cos )2 (cid:16)d2 + sin2 d2(cid:17) ,
sin (b  cos )
a2 + (b  cos )2 d  d .

(3.16)

equivalently, the same result follows if we set g = 1 directly into the expressions for the
metric (3.11) and antisymmetric (3.12) tensors. similarly, the dual model action (2.12)
is invariant under the local transformation

y = (t, x)y .

(3.17)

hence, we may evaluate (2.12) in the gauge y1 = 0. the corresponding metric (the
antisymmetric tensor turns out to be zero) is found to be

1 and e2 = 1+a1z. the metric8 in (3.16) is
where we have changed variables as y2
free of singularities (since (3.15) has no xed point) and represents a deformed 2-sphere.
in contrast, (3.18) is singular for r = 0. this is related to the fact that y1 = y2 = 0 is a
xed point of the gauge transformation (3.17). the singularity at 1 + a1z = 0 is only a
coordinate singularity and can be removed by an appropriate change of variables.

42a2

it is worth while to consider some analytic continuations of the models (3.16) and its
dual (3.18). if we let   ir, where r  [0,), and also we change the sign of the overall
coupling constant , then (3.16) becomes

ds2 =

b = 2

a

a2 + (b  cosh r)2 (cid:16)dr2 + sinh2 rd2(cid:17) ,
sinh r(b  cosh r)
a2 + (b  cosh r)2 dr  d .

(3.19)

the corresponding analytic continuation in the dual metric (3.18) should be   i, with
a parallel change of sign in the overall coupling constant. the metric in (3.19) is reduced
to the euclidean ads2 metric if we rescale the coupling constant   /a and then take
the limit a   (keeping the new coupling nite). however, for generic values of the
constant a, it represents a space that is topologically a cigar. indeed, for r  0 we get
the 2-dim euclidean space e2 in polar coordinates, whereas for r   we get, after an
appropriate change of variables, r1  s1. for b > 0, the cigar-shaped space develops a
pump corresponding to the maximum of the metric components g at

cosh r = q(1 + a2 + b2)2  4b2 + 1 + a2 + b2

2b

.

(3.20)

we note that the cigar-shape topology is also a characteristic of the euclidean black hole
corresponding to the coset sl(2, ir)/u(1) exact conformal eld theory [28]. however, in
our case the model (3.19) is not conformal. the drinfeld double for (3.19) and its dual
model is so(2, 2), with g = sl(2, ir), instead of su(2).

3.3 the dirac brackets and the generating functional

the dirac brackets for the conjugate variables in our example are most easily written
down in the basis j  = j 1  ij 2 and p = p1  ip2, where the non-zero structure
constants are f3

 = 1. using (2.46)(2.48) we obtain

3 = 2 and f 3

 = , f+

{j , j } = (xy)j (x)j (y) ,
{j +, j } = 0 ,

(3.21)
8if we set b = 1 and redene a  2/a and   a/2 the metric (3.16) and its dual (3.18) become
those derived in [12] using a limiting procedure, equivalent to (2.9). the deeper reason that validates
such a procedure is, as we have shown in the present paper, the development of a local gauge invariance
in this limit.

where the underlined terms should be omitted in the abelian limit of the dual group
g = e3. in this case the above algebra provides a canonical equivalence between the
-model for s2 and its non-abelian dual with respect to the left (or right) action of
su(2). note also that the generators j  form a subalgebra (3.21).

the generating functional that demonstrates the classical equivalence between -
models related by poissonlie t-duality based on our drinfeld double was explicitly
constructed in [12]. in a slightly dierent form than that in [12], it reads9

f = z dx(cid:16)ax + ( +   )x

notice that the above generating functional depends only on the combination  + ; it
is therefore invariant under the u(1) gauge transformation  =  and  = . the
generating functional for the deformed coset models (3.16) is obtained by solving the
equation f
 = 0) for + and inserting the result back into (3.24).10
the result is a generating functional, which is non-polynomial in derivatives with respect
to x. the obtained expressions are quite complicated and not very illustrative, so that we
decided to present the corresponding result for the -model for s2 and its non-abelian
dual. we start with the generating functional corresponding to the 2-dim -models for
s3 and its non-abelian dual with respect to the left (or right) action of su(2) that was
x). this is
easily modied to depend on the angles  and  only through the combination  + ,

obtained in [18]. in our notation it is given by f = r dx(y1l1
by adding the term r dxxz. such a term, being dependent on the variables of only

cot1, (y1 cos  + y2 sin ) should be replaced by (y1 cos  + y2 sin ) tan

10such a procedure is motivated by the fact that the variations f

 , corresponding to the
conjugate momenta p and p, are zero since the variables  and  have dropped out of the corre-
sponding dual -models because of the gauge invariance. also, thanks to the latter, only one of these
variations is independent. this procedure has an obvious generalization for the more general coset
models constructed in section 2. for some similar considerations, see [29] and more recently [30].

one of the dual models, can be absorbed as total derivative into the corresponding action
and hence it does not aect the classical dynamics. explicitly, the resulting generating
functional is

f = z dx(cid:16)(z cos  +  sin  sin( + ))x +  cos( + )x  ( + )xz(cid:17) . (3.25)

the variation of f with respect to  +  gives

tan( + ) =

xzr2(cid:16)(x)2 + sin2 (x)2(cid:17)  (xz)2  2 sin xx

(xz)2  2(x)2

.

(3.26)

substituting back into (3.25) we obtain

f = z dx r2(cid:16)(x)2 + sin2 (x)2(cid:17)  (xz)2 + z cos x  ( + )xz! ,

(3.27)
where  +  is given by (3.26). the generating functional (3.27) is non-polynomial
in the derivatives of the elds with respect to x.
in that sense it belongs to a new
class of generating functionals, which depend not only on the elds of the two dual -
models, but also on their rst derivatives with respect to the space-like variable in a
non-trivial way. for comparison, up to now, either in the case of non-abelian duality
[18, 19, 20] or for poissonlie t-duality (and its possible generalizations) [14, 15], there
was no dependence of the generating functional on more than the rst power of these
derivatives (see, for example (3.24)). finally, we note that, according to the work in
[31], generating functionals of the form (3.27), being non-linear, are expected to receive
quantum corrections. consequently, the corresponding duality rules relating the 2-dim
eld theories, as well as the algebra (2.46)(2.48), are expected to be quantum-corrected.

4 renormalization group ow

in this section we study the 1-loop rg equations corresponding to the three-dimensional
model (3.11), (3.12). we will show that there are no xed points in the ow and also
that the correct description of the models is a non-perturbative one. however, for large
domains in parameter space and for a wide range of energies in the uv, the description
is eectively perturbative and the model becomes a two-dimensional one. finally, by
performing some analytic continuations we will nd three- and two-dimensional models
with xed points under the rg ow, where the theory becomes free.

we begin this section with a short review of rg ow in 2-dim eld theories with
curved target spaces. and (3.16). the 2-dim -model corresponding to the metric (3.11)
and antisymmetric tensor (3.12) is of the form

it will be renormalizable if the corresponding counter-terms, at a given order in a loop
expansion, can be absorbed into a renormalization of the coupling constant  and (or) of
some parameters labelled collectively by ai, i = 1, 2, . . . in addition, we allow for general
eld redenitions of the x s, which are coordinate reparametrizations in the target
space. this denition of renormalizability of -models is quite strict and similar to that
for ordinary eld theories. a natural extension of this is to allow for the manifold to vary
with the mass scale and the rg to act in the innite-dimensional space of all metrics and
torsions [32]. further discussion of this generalized renormalizability will not be needed
for our purposes. perturbatively, in powers of , we express the bare quantities, denoted
by a zero as a subscript, as

4.1 models with no xed points

4.1.1 three-dimensional models

in the metric (3.11) there are three parameters a, b and g and the three euler angles
,  and  will be denoted by x . also for the antisymmetric tensor in (3.12) we have
h 
 = 0. examining (4.3) we nd that the coupling  and the coordinates (, , ) do
not renormalize and therefore the corresponding beta-functions are zero.11 in contrast,

11we believe that the non-renormalization of the overall coupling constant  will persist in general
for all poissonlie t-duality-related models with actions (2.1) and (2.2). on the other hand, models
corresponding to a limit of (3.11) and with target space s 3 or its deformation along a direction in the
cartan subalgebra of su (2) [34] (see also the comments after (4.9) below), have an overall coupling
constant that gets renormalized [34]. the reason for this apparent paradox is that, in these models, the
overall coupling constant is related to our  by rescalings, such as those described in footnote 8, with
parameters that get renormalized.

(4.4)

this system of coupled non-linear equations12 can be considerably simplied. first, using
(4.4), we may easily show that there is a rg-ow-invariant dened as

(4.6)

without loss of generality we may assume that  > 0 since (4.5) remains invariant under
   and b  b. then, using the last two equations in (4.4) we may derive an
equation for b as a function of g whose solution is

b = g(cid:18) q2  1 + e2c(1 + 1/g)2 (cid:19) ,

(4.7)

where c is a real constant, which is determined by the initial conditions for b and g.
the sign in front of the square root in (4.7) is changed when g = 0, in order to ensure
the continuity of b as a function of the energy scale t = ln . hence, the only dierential
equation we still have to solve is the one for g, which, after using (4.5), takes the form

g =




b
a

(g + 1)(b + g) ,

(4.8)

where a and b are determined by (4.6) and (4.7). since the rg equations are real, a2
will stay strictly non-negative and therefore b will oscillate with t = ln  between its
minimum and maximum values b and b+, where a = 0. when a  0, for nite values of
the overall coupling constant , the curvature for the metric (3.11) approaches innity
and the perturbative expansion of the rg equations becomes meaningless.

we have seen that the correct description of the theory is a genuine non-perturbative
one. neverthelss, for   1 we will show that there exists a wide range of energies in
the uv, where the description is eectively perturbative. moreover, there exists a xed

12presumably, the dual to the (3.11), (3.12) model will also have the same beta-functions (4.4). we
also note that it is highly non-trivial that the change of the matrix (3.10) under the rg eqs. (4.4)
preserves its form. for example, had we started, as in [16], with a matrix e 1
0 proportional to the
identity, then eqs. (4.4) would have generated o-diagonal elements. this is clearly seen by computing
the right-hand sides of eqs. (4.4) for a = b = 1 and g = 0. by doing so we obtain the innitesimal
change of e 1

0 = i (to lowest order) and eq. (102) of [16] (with c = 1).

then the metric (3.11) becomes

= d2 + sin2 d2 + (1 + g)(d + cos d)2 ,

(4.10)

which is the deformed su(2) principal chiral model considered in [34]. also the rst
two of the above equations are those derived in [34] for the corresponding coupling  and
deformation parameter g. in the uv the solution of (4.9) is

(4.12)

is fullled, then a  1 and the model is indeed described perturbatively by (4.10). the
point g = 1 is a uv-xed point, where the metric (4.10) becomes s2. however, outside
the validity of (4.12) the correct description is non-perturbative.

4.1.2 two-dimensional models

let us now return to the 2-dim models (3.16) and (3.18). as before, there is no wave-
function renormalization for  and , and the beta-function for the coupling  is zero.
for the couplings a and b the corresponding beta-functions can be obtained by simply
setting g = 1 into (4.4). the reason why such a procedure is consistent seems to be
intimately related to the local invariance that reduces the 3-dim models into 2-dim ones.
hence, we have

(1 + a2  b2) ,

a = 

b =

ab ,

17

(4.13)

which are nothing but the beta-functions for the 2-dim model (3.16) as well as for its
dual (3.18).13 this is a strong hint that their classical equivalence can be promoted into
a quantum one as well. having said that we note, once again, that g = 1 is not a xed
point of the (4.8) in the uv. since (4.5) is still a rg invariant of (4.13), it is clear that
one variable between a and b is an independent one. eliminating a from (4.13) using
(4.5), we obtain

b = 




bq(b+  b)(b  b) .

(4.14)

hence, the solution for b as a function of the energy scale t = ln  oscillates between b+
and b as

1

b(t)

=  + 2  1 sin




(t  t0) ,

(4.15)

where t0 is an arbitrary reference scale. this means that the corresponding -model
actions do not dene local eld theories and can be considered at most as eective
actions for scales such that b stays away from b.

the usual s2 metric and its non-abelian dual with respect to the right (or left) action
of su(2) are obtained from (3.16) and (3.18) if we rescale the coupling constant   /a
and then take the limit a   (keeping the new coupling nite). however, this limit
is problematic at the quantum level since the corresponding -functions do not tend to
the beta-function obtained by studying the 2-dim eld theories based on s2 (and its
non-abelian dual) by themselves [12]. the latter is, at one-loop, just  =  2
2 and is
consistent with the fact that these models are asymptotically free. it is formally obtained
by the rst of (4.13) in the limit a   after we rescale   /a as described above.
this limit does not correspond to any xed point of (4.13). it is easily seen that, from
a rg theory view point, these models oer an eective description of the more general
models (3.16) and (3.18) in the case of   b    1, which, according to (4.15), occurs
at scales 

2 + 1

 mod(2).

4.2 models with xed points

4.2.1 three-dimensional models

we have seen that our model (3.11), (3.12) does not have a true xed point under the
1-loop rg eqs. (4.8). consider, however, the analytic continuation   i and a  ia.
13in order to compare with a and  as given by eq. (47) of [12], one should remember that these
correspond to the model (3.19) with b = 1. imposing that b = 1 and further requiring that b = 0
enforces a wave-function renormalization of the , i.e.
a sin , in order for the
model to be 1-loop-renormalizable. then it turns out that a =  
2 (4 + a2). after taking into account
the redenitions of the various parameters, as described in footnote 8 of the present paper, this implies
eq. (47) of [12].

in (4.2) we have 1 =  1

(4.17)

(4.18)

the fact that the antisymmetric tensor is imaginary is bothersome if we want to describe
models in 2-dim minkowskian space-times. however, for euclidean ones, the (locally)
exact 2-form measures the charge of non-trivial instanton-like congurations. the per-
turbative expansion is completely independent of the antisymmetric tensor, but this will
denitely play a role in a, yet lacking, non-perturbative formulation of the model. the
1-loop rg equations for the metric (4.16) are obtained from (4.4) by the analytic con-
tinuation we have described above. then the analogue of (4.8) is given by

g =

and b is still given by (4.7). as before, we will assume that  > 0 with no loss of
generality. however, now  does not have to be larger than or equal to 1, as in (4.6),
in order to ensure reality for a. if  < 1 then b are complex conjugate of each other
and, unlike the case when they are real, b can take any real value without spoiling the

reality of the parameter a. however, now the condition |1 + 1/g|  ec1  2 has to
be fullled in order for b to remain real. if on the other hand  > 1, then b are both
real and the reality condition for a requires that b  b+ > b or b  b < b+. since
0 < b < b+, it turns out that there are xed points for initial conditions where b is less
than b. consider rst the rg eq. (4.19) near the point with g = 1/(ec  1), b = 0 and
a = 1. it can be written as (we take the lower sign in (4.7)):

g

g(g  g) ,

for ec > 1 we have  1

where g0 represents any of the two xed points g or g. this represents a free theory,
as can be seen by changing variables as sin  = 1
cosh y . it is interesting to note that in the
case ec > 1 the signature of the metric in (4.23) is ( + ) in the ir xed point g0 = g
and (+ + +) in the uv xed point g0 = g. also in the case of 0 < ec < 1 the signature
at the g0 = g uv-stable point is (+ + ), but in the other uv-stable point at g0 = g
it is (+ + +). hence, only at g = g the metric has euclidean signature and we expect a
well-dened eld-theoretical description.

let us also note that for   1 the rg ow is described, as before, by (4.9), (4.11)

and the corresponding -model is again (4.10), provided (4.12) is satised.

4.2.2 two-dimensional models

now we turn to the 2-dim model (3.16) after the same analytic continuation as before,
a  ia and   i:

ds2 =

b = 2i

a

a2  (b  cos )2 (cid:16)d2 + sin2 d2(cid:17) ,
sin (b  cos )
a2  (b  cos )2 d  d .

(4.24)

(4.25)

the 1-loop rg equation corresponding to (4.14) is

b = 




bq(b  b+)(b  b) .

the form of the solution for b as a function of the energy scale t = ln  depends on
whether or not  is smaller or larger than 1. we nd

1

b(t)

=  +1  2 sinh




(tt0) ,

if

 < 1 , 


2

ln(cid:18)1 + 

1  (cid:19)  tt0 <  , (4.26)

where t0 denotes again an arbitrary reference scale. we see that in the uv there is a
xed point at b = 0 (and a = 1). the lower bound for t above is needed for b to stay
positive, since only then is (4.26) a solution of (4.25). for the case of  > 1, we have
to distinguish the solutions between those with b  b and those with b  b+. in the
former case we obtain

1

b(t)

=  + 2  1 cosh




(t  t0) ,

if

 > 1 ,

t  t0 ,

(4.27)

and

b(t)

=  

2  1 cosh




(t t0) ,

if

 > 1 ,


2

ln(cid:18)  + 1

  1(cid:19)  t t0 <  , (4.28)



where, as before, t0 and t0 are arbitrary reference scales. for the trajectory given by
(4.27), b stays positive. it starts at b = b for t = t0, and ends at b = 0 for t  . for
the trajectory given by (4.28), b is always negative and starts at b =  for t  t0 =
1(cid:17) and ends at b = 0 for t  . hence, we see that b = 0 is a uv xed point.
2 ln(cid:16) +1

also as we lower the scale t towards the ir, the solution becomes singular in both cases.
in any case, we then run into non-perturbative regimes. for trajectories in the region
1(cid:17)  t  t0  0. in the
b  b+, the solution is still given by (4.28), but with  
lower limit b   and in the upper limit b = b+. hence in that case we have a singular
behaviour of the 1-loop rg equations towards the ir as well as the uv. as we have
mentioned, in those cases the corresponding 2-dim eld theory is not well dened at the
quantum level and can be considered only as an eective eld theory at scales away from
the singularities.

2 ln(cid:16) +1

the 2-dim model corresponding to the xed point at b = 0 is obtained by setting

g0 = 1 in (4.23)

ds2 =

1

sin2  (cid:16)d2 + sin2 d2(cid:17) ,

b = 2i cot  d  d .

(4.29)

the fact that (3.16) approaches a free-eld conformal eld theory at the xed point is
similar to the case of an integrable model (dierent from (3.16)), representing also a 1-
parameter deformation of s2, that was considered in [11]. it is interesting to investigate
whether or not (3.16) represents also an integrable perturbation of s2.

5 concluding remarks

we have constructed a new class of 2-dim eld theories with target spaces corresponding
to deformations of coset spaces g/h. our models correspond to special points of the
classical moduli space of models related by poissonlie t-duality, where a local invariance
develops. a classication of all possible models that arise with such a procedure is an
interesting open problem and can be done by analyzing the general conditions (2.16), or
equivalently (2.31). by construction these models come in dual pairs. the corresponding
generating functionals depend non-polynomially on the derivatives of the elds with
respect to the space-like variable. the latter feature is also manifested in an underlying
innite-dimensional algebra with a central extension of the parafermionic type. it would
also be interesting to uncover the relation of our models to those in [35].

we have also performed a quite general rg ow analysis using specic models with
3- and 2-dim target spaces. as in [12], we conclude that quantum aspects of the lower

21

dimensional models do not necessarily follow by taking the same classical limit as that
used to relate the corresponding 2-dim eld-theoretical classical actions. concretely,
the beta-function equations for the lower-dimensional models follow from those of the
original models by just setting some parameters to their prescribed values (see (4.4) and
(4.13)). however, these values do not necessarily correspond to any xed points of the
solutions of these equations. using our 3-dim example we saw that in a large domain in
parameter space, and for a wide range of energies in the uv, the description is eectively
perturbative with a uv-xed point exactly where the local gauge invariance develops.
we believe that this feature will persist for more general models related by poissonlie
t-duality. in that respect it would be very interesting to study the rg ow in general
using (2.1) and (2.2) and possibly to formulate this ow in a duality-invariant way.

a proof of (2.31)

in this appendix we prove that (2.32) (or equivalently (2.31)) follows from the conditions
(2.17)) (or equivalently (2.16)). first we rewrite (2.32), using an obvious matrix notation,
as

s1  t s = 0 ,

a1  t a = bt .

(a.1)

in [15] explicit expressions for the matrices a, b,  were found in terms of normal coor-
dinates parametrizing the group manifolds.14 in our case we have h = eixata  h  g.
then dening two matrices f and f with matrix elements

(a.2)

(a.3)

f

 = fc

xc ,

f  = f 

cxc ,

we obtain

 = (ef )

 ,

b =



n

(1)m
(n + 1)!

(f t )nm ff m .

xn=0

xm=0

using these expressions it is easy to show that proving (a.1) is equivalent to proving

sf n+1 + (1)n(f t )n+1s = 0 ,
af n+1 + (1)n(f t )n+1a =
xm=0

n

n  0 ,

(1)m(f t )m f f nm ,

n  0 .

(a.4)

their proof proceeds by induction. for n = 0, the above conditions reduce to

(a.5)
14we also correct a misprint in the expression for the matrix b as it appeared in [15]. in eq. (41), n!

sf + f t s = 0 ,

af + f t a = f .

should be replaced by (n + 1)!.

22

these are nothing but the conditions (2.17) (in a matrix notation after we contract by
xc appropriately) and by assumption they are satised. asumming that (a.4) are valid
for n = m for some m  1, we may easily show, with the aid of (a.5), that they also
hold for n = m + 1. that proves (a.4) for all n  0.
