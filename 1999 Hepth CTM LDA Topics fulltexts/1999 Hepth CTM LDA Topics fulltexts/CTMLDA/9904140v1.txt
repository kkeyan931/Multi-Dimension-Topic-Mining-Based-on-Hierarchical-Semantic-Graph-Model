abstract

we perform a two-loop calculation in light-front 4 theory to determine the
eective mass renormalization of the light-front hamiltonian. the renormalization
scheme adopted here is manifestly boost invariant, and yields results that are in
perfect agreement with the explicitly covariant feynman diagram approach.

1

1 introduction

it has been known for some time that renormalizing light-front hamiltonians is an ex-

tremely complicated task whenever cut-os are employed that violate boost invariance

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. the diculty arises from the potentially innite number of operators that

are needed to restore the niteness and lorentz invariance of the physical light-front

hamiltonian.

one way to circumvent these diculties is to adopt a manifestly boost-invariant

regularization scheme. such a scheme has been successfully employed in a treatment
of matrix eld theories with 3 interactions [6], following earlier work on the small-x
behavior of light-cone wave functions [7, 8]. more recently, a boost-invariant similarity
group procedure was applied to scalar 3 theory [9].

in this work, we follow the approach suggested in [6] to determine the eective two-
loop mass renormalization of the 4 light-front hamiltonian. in section 2, we begin by
presenting the light-front formulation of scalar 4 eld theory in d  2 dimensions, and
its subsequent quantization via commutation relations. in section 3, we employ a man-

ifestly boost-invariant procedure to extract the eective two-loop mass renormalization

of the light-front hamiltonian. this result will be compared to a feynman diagram cal-

culation that can be performed straightforwardly in two dimensions. a brief discussion

of our results will appear in section 4.

it is now a matter of substituting the fourier representation (9) for the quantized matrix

3 two-loop mass renormalization

we are now interested in calculating the eective two-loop contribution to the mass

term in the light-cone hamiltonian, which is represented diagrammatically in fig 1. one

advantage of working in light-cone coordinates is the absence of tadpole diagrams.

i.e.

the only two-loop contribution to the mass is given by the setting sun diagram below.

a convenient strategy is to compute this diagram for vanishing (external) longitudinal

figure 1:

momentum k+  0. the details of this method appear in an earlier article [6], so we will
mention only the key ideas here.



first, note that the two-loop process can be obtained by two applications of the light-

cone hamiltonian; one application corresponds to the creation of three partons from a
single parton via the interaction aaaa, while the subsequent interaction aaaa will
absorb these same three partons to leave one parton left over. during the intermediate

step, where there are three partons in ight, the sum of the light-cone momenta must be
equal to the initial parton momentum, which we write as (k+, k).

we now consider what happens in fig 1. when the incoming longitudinal momentum

k+ is made vanishingly small by taking the limit k+  0.
it is important to stress
that in this limit, we never set k+ identically to zero; we simply investigate the limiting
contribution of the diagram as k+  which is always positive  is made arbitrarily small.
a detailed calculation paralleling the one carried out in [6]  in which one studies

the bound state integral equations governing the light-cone wave functions in the limit

4

of vanishing k+  may be used to calculate the limiting contribution of this diagram to
the mass renormalization. the result is

this quantity depends on k only, since any dependence on k+ was eliminated after
taking the limit k+  0. in order to nd the renormalized mass, we set k = 0.

some remarks are in order. firstly, note that a remnant of the longitudinal integration

survives through the variables ,  and . these quantities represent the fractions of the
external longitudinal momentum k+, and are thus integrated over the interval (0, 1).
they are not eliminated in the limit k+  0. to further illuminate the signicance of
these variables, we consider the special case of 1 + 1 dimensions (i.e. d = 2). in this

case, the mass renormalization is

(15)

now consider the feynman integral for the setting sun diagram of scalar 4 theory in
1+1 dimensions, with zero external momenta [10]. in this case, the mass renormalization

turns out to be

2 + m2)[(p1 + p2)2 + m2]

(16)

if we use feynman parameters to rewrite this last integral [11], and perform the momen-

tum integration, we end up with expression (15). i.e. the integrals (14) and (16) are equal
in 1 + 1 dimensions. it would be interesting to test for equality in d  3 dimensions,
and we leave this for future work.

interestingly, the parameters , ,  above  which correspond to fractions of longitu-

dinal light-cone momentum in the light-cone approach  represent the familiar feynman

parameters in the usual covariant feynman diagram approach. we have therefore dis-

covered a physical basis for the feynman parameters.

the actual value of the integral may be computed [10, 12], and is given by

where (x) is eulers psi function. the terms in the parenthesis has the numerical value
3.51586 . . ..

we leave an analysis of the self-energy contribution (k) in d > 2 dimensions for

future work.

4 discussion

we have calculated the two-loop mass renormalization for the eective light-cone hamil-
tonian of scalar 4 eld theory. an explicit evaluation of the corresponding integral in
two dimensions was given, and shown to be precisely equal to the corresponding two-loop

setting sun feynman diagram. moreover, we were able to attribute physical signicance

to the familiar feynman parameters; namely, as fractions of vanishingly small external

light-cone momenta.

evidently, it would be interesting to study the integral (14) in more detail for higher

space-time dimensions. in particular, ultraviolet divergences are expected in dimensions
d  3, and so we may invoke dimensional regularization to regulate the integration over
transverse momentum space. this would facilitate a straightforward comparison with
existing feynman diagram calculations in 4 theory [11].
