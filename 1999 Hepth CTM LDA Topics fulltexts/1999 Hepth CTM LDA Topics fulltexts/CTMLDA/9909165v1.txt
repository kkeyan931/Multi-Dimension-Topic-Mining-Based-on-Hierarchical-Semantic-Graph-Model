assuming dynamical spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry for massless gauge theory with-
out scalar elds, we nd a method how to construct an eective action of the dynamical nambu-
goldstone bosons and elemetary fermions by using auxiliary elds. here dynamical particles are
asssumed to be composed of elementary fermions. various quantities including decay constants are
calculated from this eective action.

i. introduction

according to the paper by nambu and jona-lasinio [1] or more precisely the goldstone theorem, [2] if the lagrangian
without scalar elds has a continuum global symmetry and if this symmetry is spontaneously broken, then there must
appear dynamically generated massless spin-0 partilcles, the so-called nambu-goldstone (ng) bosons, the number
of which is determined how the symmetry is broken. then it is necessary to have eective interations among the
ng bosons and elementary particles to study the eects of this symmetry breakdown, either they appear as physical
particles with tiny masses or are absorbed by guage elds to make them massive.

quite often these ng bosons acquire tiny masses through quantum corrections and/or soft symmetry breaking to
give actual physical eects. in these cases we really need an eective lagrangian to calculate those physical eects.
there are a couple of examples of eective lagrangians known among the ng bosons and elementary particles.
for instance, there are the original nambu-jona-lasinio model [1] of four-fermi interactions with spontaneous chiral
symmetry breakdown in which the ng boson is completely massless, and the axion model [3] due to breakdown of the
peccei-quinn symmetry [4] in which the axion (pseudo-ng boson) acquires a little mass through quantum corrections,
etc. the former case, which is the rst paper to stimulate the study of spontaneous symmetry breakdown, we just need
to calculate the ordinary feynman rules for elementary fermions as well as would-be ng bosons which are expressed
as a chain of fermion loops. in the latter case we must assume and/or guess eective interactions with some unknown
coupling constants although some constraints are enforced.

there is another interesting example in which people have calculated physical quantities without an eective action.
when one calculates the pion decay constant, one uses the eective coupling between the pion (ng boson) and quarks
(or nucleons), which was, utilizing the jackiw-johnson [5] sum rule, originally derived by pagels and stokar [6] applying
the ward-takahashi (wt) identity to the axial vector vertex. this way of determining the eective coupling, i.e.,
direct use of the wt identiy to the vertex, includes ambiguities. the kyoto group has used the bethe-salpeter
(bs) equation to uniquely determine this eective coupling and to calculate it perturbatively. [7] they calculate the
expectation value of an axial vector current sandwitched between vacuum and pion state and relates it with the bs
amplitude to obtain the pion decay constant. in these approaches there do not appear the dynamical ng bosons.
instead the pagels and stoker use only the wt identiy, and the kyoto group uses a classical equation for the bs
amplitude. hence it does not seem to be clear how actually the ng boson couples to other elementary and/or
dynamical elds as an operator form.

here we propose one approach to construct an eective lagrangian among the ng bosons and elementary elds,
i.e., the auxiliary eld method, which was once in fashion to construct various kinds of models out of four-fermi
interactions and also to study chiral symmetry breakdown. [8,9] with this method one can determine uniquely the
coupling of the ng boson with fermions as an operator form. in this paper to show how powerful this approach is,
we start from the simplest example, u (1) massless gauge theory without scalar elds to derive the coupling among

the dynamically generated ng bosons and fermions, to prove masslessness of the ng boson, and to calculate the
decay constant of this ng boson in section ii. then in section iii we proceed into su (3) color gauge theory with
iso-doublet fermions (up and down quarks) without scalar elds to do the same thing in section ii and to give the
pion decay constant. the nal section iv is devoted to the summary and discussions of our method compared with
others.

ii. u (1) massless gauge theory

the lagrangian for massless u (1) gauge theory is given by

l0 =

(a)2 +  id/ ,

(1)

where d =   iga and  is a gauge parameter. in this paper we use minkowski metric except for a few equations.
in order to introduce auxiliary elds as dynamical ones, we rst functionally integrate the partition function over
gauge elds a. the resultant four-fermi interaction terms are rewritten by using the fierz transformation as

then by introducing the gaussian term which is quadratic in auxiliary elds and cancels four-fermi terms in eq. (2)

we obtain [9],

where d1(x  y) is nothing but 1/d(x  y) and assumed are (x, y) = (y, x) and (x, y) = (y, x). since main
purpose of this paper is to present our idea as simple as possible, we have neglected other modes.

next we assume that bilocal elds can be decomposed into local elds with continuum indices as follows.

(x, y) = 0(x  y) +

0(x  y)

f

(x, y) =

0(x  y)

f

2 (cid:19) ,
(cid:18) x + y

2 (cid:19) ,
(cid:18) x + y

(6a)

(6b)

where elds with arguments x  y are considered to be classical elds and those with (x + y)/2 to be quantum ones like
in the operator product expansion. also assumed is that 0(x  y) is a vacuum expectation value (vev) of (x, y).
the vev should depend only on x  y because of translational invariance. the coordinate (x + y)/2 is the center of
mass system. here a constant parameter f has massive dimension one, 0(x  y), 0(x  y), and 0(x  y) dimension
ve, and ((x + y)/2) and ((x + y)/2) dimension one. the dierence between quantum and classical elds can be
seen by fourier-transforming elds with arguments x  y into momentum space, in which case, e.g., (x, y) can be
interpreted as local elds with continuum label of internal momentum.

from symmetrical point of view, it holds

since we are interested in describing the ng boson, i.e., ((x + y)/2), and in obtaining the equations for 0(x  y)
and 0(x  y), functionally integrating over fermions and keeping only 0(x  y), 0(x  y), and ((x + y)/2), we
obtain

0(x  y) = 0(x  y).

(9)

in calculating tr ln, we have negelected the term /x inside since we are not interested in the derivative terms in x.
now setting (x) = 0 in eq. (8) since the vev of this eld is zero by denition ((x) is the ng boson) and
varying se in terms of (q), we can obtain an equation for (q). this is nothing but the gap equation, i.e., this
gives the mass, (q), for a fermion.

which becomes a familiar form when converted into one in euclidean space and in the landau gauge  = 0.

next extracting only the bilinear terms in (x) from eq. (8), we obtain the mass term for (x) as

(10)

(11)

which is identically zero when one identies 0(q) with (q) and uses eq. (10). in other words, when one requires
masslessness of the ng boson (x), then 0(q) = (q) is automatically derived up to a constant f . this proves
masslessness of the ng boson, (x). back to eq. (5) this result means that the yukawa coupling of the ng boson
(x) with fermions is given by

in momentum space. here elds with tilde are fourier-transformed ones. the feynman rule for the vertex of ,
i.e., fermion-anti-fermion-ng boson vertex, is nally given by

this result coincides with that derived by using the bs equation [7] and slightly diers from that originally derived

by pagels and stokar [6] using the wt identity. eqs. (6) are rewritten as

(x, y) =

(x, y) =

0(x  y)

(cid:20)f + (cid:18) x + y

(14a)

(14b)

these equations mean that the elds (x, y) and (x, y) should be rescaled by a factor 0(x  y)/f to obtain ordinary
dynamical elds and a scalar eld (x) (= f (x, y)/0(r)) has a vacuum expectation value f to become a massive
scalar eld (x).

now we calculate the decay constant from this vertex. the decay constant, f , is dened by a matrix element of
the axial vector current as given by the left hand side of the following equation which is related to f with the right
hand side (rhs) of the following equation.

in the q  0 limit, our vertex, the beth-salpeter vertex, and the pagels-stokar vertex, all give the same expression
for the decay constant f . this equation could be written in an operator form as

(0) 5(0)(cid:12)(cid:12) (q)(cid:11) = 2i f q.
(cid:10)0(cid:12)(cid:12)

(16)

the factor 2 of eqs. (15, 16) are explained in the nal section iv, wich is peculiar to u (1) theory. the rhss of
eqs. (15, 16) should have these signs if the sign of the rhs of eq. (36) is positive. these signs are all correlated with
each other. what this physically means can be seen by assuming an external axial vector eld coupled to the axial
vector current given by the left hand side of eq. (16) and consider its quantum corrections as depicted in fig.2.

(x) is an external eld. then calculate quantum corrections to this term which is given by a fermion one-loop
diagram shown in fig.2, variate the whole term in a5
(x) is a dynamical gauge eld, and set the nal
expression zero. this gives eq. (16). the expression for the decay constant f itself is given by the fermion one-loop
diagram depicted in fig.2 keeping only a linear term in momentum q and setting the calculation equal to 2 f q,

fig.2 to the r.h.s. of eq. (16) bacause q is an outgoing momentum. another physical interpretation of eqs. (16, 17)
is given in the nal section iv.

iii. su (3) color gauge theory with iso-doublet

now that we have described our idea in the former section, we would like to proceed into a more realistic case,

su (3) color gauge theory with massless iso-doublet fermions, u and d quarks.

the dierence between u (1) and su (3) cases is rst the color factor, and secondly the avor number. although
the arguments to obtain the pion decay constant f in su (3) are almost parallel to the u (1) case, there are a couple
of numerical factor dierence. hence most of the equations dierent from u (1) case are described below. first we
have the following coupling beween the dynamical scalar and fermions,

z d4x d4y (x)h(x, y) + i5a(x, y) ai(y),

(19)

where (x) = (u(x), d(x))t and  a are the 2  2 pauli matrices. likewise we can easily derive masslessness of the ng
boson, a(x), and the auxiliary elds given by eq. (6b) should be replaced with

with

note that the coecient of a on the rhs of eq. (22) is 1 instead of 2. the feynman rule for the vertex a in

iv. summary and discussion

in this paper we have shown how useful and easy our approach is and derived that by introducing the auxiliary
elds, composite elds have a coupling with fermions and can be decomposed into local elds multiplied by a factor
which is given by the solution to the gap equation, that the ng bosons are acually massless, and that the decay
constant f is a vacuum expectation value of a composite scalar eld and calculated by a one-loop fermion diagram
given by fig.2 after taking a limit of q  0. these have been done both for u (1) and su (3) massless gauge theories
without scalar elds.

now in this section, we show the relation in the simplest u (1) case between our method without the wt identity
and others using the wt identity. if the chiral symmetry is not broken, the axial vector ward-takahashi identity is
given by

q5

(p + q, p) = s1

f (p + q) 5 + 5 s1

f (p),

where sf (p) is a fermion full propagator given by

sf (p) =

p/  (p)

.

the usual way to obtain eq. (26) is to calculate the divergence of the t product,

(cid:2)q5, (x)(cid:3) = i (x)5, q5 =z d4x j 5

0 (x),

(29a)

(29b)

(29c)

where q5 is an operator which generates chiral transformation. negative sign of eq. (28b) comes from eqs. (29b).
now let us graphically calculate 5
(p + q, p) when the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. in this case, since
only the fermions as well as gauge elds are elementary, a massless pole contribution to 5
(p + q, p) can be depicted
in fig.3 and the whole 5

(p + q, p) with a tree vertex is given by,

(p + q, p) = i 5  2i f g(p + q, p)

where regular part means the remaining terms which are not singular at q2 = 0.

these are the arguments of references [57]. pagels and stokar [6] have suggested the form of g(p + q, p) so that
the wt identiy eqs. (26, 30a) is satised and gives a form slightly dierent from eq. (30b). the kyoto group [7] uses
eq. (30b) as a normalization of the bs amplitude. all these arguments have meaning only in the limit of q  0. we
would like to put stress upon again the reason why the second term in the rhs of eq. (30a) is added to 5
(p + q, p).
this is because people so far have treated the ng boson as a composite particle of fermions, not an elementary eld,
and hence the feynman diagram for the vertex shown in fig.3 consisting only of fermions and gauge elds should be
included.

on the other hand, in our case we treat the ng boson as an elementary eld although dynamical so that we can
directly derive the coupling between fermions and the ng bosons. let us see how this aects the above arguments on
derivation of the wt identity. since the ng bosons are introduced in the eective lagrangian, the noether current
must be modied so that it includes the contributions from the scalars, which is given by

j 5
(x) = j 5

(x) 

l



 

l
 ,

(31)

(x) is given by eq. (28b). in our case the correct noether current is given by eq. (31) and hence replacing

where j 5
(x) with j 5
j 5

(x) in eqs. (29), the following equations hold,

h q5, (x)i = i5(x),
h q5, (x)i = 2(x),
q5 =z d4x j 5

0 (x),

h q5, (x)i = i (x)5,
h q5, (x)i = 2(x),

 j 5

(x) = 0.

(32a)

(32b)

(32c)

using these equations, one can easily show that the same wt identity as eq. (26) holds.

the second and third terms of the rhs of eq. (31) are expected to be obtained from the kinetic terms of the scalars,
which are, however, not present in the eective lagrangian obtained after a couple of manipulations. therefore either
that kinetic terms must be produced by quantum corrections or the correction terms to the noether current should
directly be calculated. what we have done in sect. ii is a calculation of the correction term directly concerned with
the chiral symmetry breakdown. there we have calculated fig.2 and obtained the term proportional to  (the rst
term of the rhs of eq. (16)) that we need now. that is, we have required that the diagram is equal to



l



 = 2f (x) + . . . ,

(33)

which determines f in terms of (x) after symmetry breaks down. namely the feynman diagram corresponding
to fig.3 is now given by fig.4, which gives massless particle (ng boson) contribution to the vertex. this is a
multiplication of two diagrams, fig.2 and fig.1 and in between them there is a massless ng boson propagator which
gives a 1/q2 pole term.

fig.2 gives a factor 2f q, fig.1 does (p + q/2) 5/f , and the  propagator does i/q2. after multiplying all these
factors, we obtain 2i(p + q/2) 5 q/q2, which is exactly equal to the second term of the rhs of the wt identity
eq. (30a).

finally we would like to make some comments what we have described on eq. (17) in sect. ii. there we have
(x). if we temporarily forget that
 is an external source and treat it as if it is an elementary eld, the fermion-anti-fermion-ng boson vertex

 which couples to the noether current, j 5

introduced the external source eld, a5
the eld a5
is given by

5

(p + q, p) =z d4x d4y eiqxipy h0| t(cid:0)a5

(x)(y) (0)(cid:1) |0iamp ,

which corresponds to a bare vertex i5. here the subscript amp means vertex functions are amputated. taking
an analogy to the ordinary elementary higgs eld, what we need is the following two-point function,

(34)

(35)

(q) =z d4x eiqx h0| t(cid:0)a5

(x)(0)(cid:1) |0iamp ,

which is nothing but 2f q in the limit of q  0 and gives the expression for f in terms of (x). this is what we
have done in sect. ii. let us see that the above two-point function exactly gives a decay constant if we regard a5
 as
a chiral gauge eld and expand the ordinary gauge-invariant higgs kinetic term,

2 |d ((x) + i(x))|2 =
2(cid:2)(cid:0)  2ia5 (cid:1) ((x)  i(x))(cid:0) + 2ia5

(cid:1) ((x) + i(x))(cid:3) = 2f a5

 + . . . ,

(36)

where the charge of the scalar term (x)+i(x) is -2 as shown by eq. (32b) and use has been made of < 0|(x)|0 >= f
as given by eq. (14a). notice that a relative sign between a5
 in eq. (36) is plus which is the

same as in eq. (31).
introduction of a5

 can be compared with that of the second rank tensor eld coupled with the energy momentum
tensor, which as well known will be a candidate of a gravitational eld. if we assume a general coordinate invariance,
then this tensor eld becomes a real gravitational eld. here we do not assume a local gauge invariance of chiral
symmetry. that subject will be a next problem to be solved, which will certainly give mass to the gauge elds.
