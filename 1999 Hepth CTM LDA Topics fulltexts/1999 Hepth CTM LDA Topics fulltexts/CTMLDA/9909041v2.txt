abstract

we consider the sector of n = 8 ve-dimensional gauged supergravity with non-trivial
scalar elds in the coset space sl(6, ir)/so(6), plus the metric. we nd that the
most general supersymmetric solution is parametrized by six real moduli and analyze its
properties using the theory of algebraic curves. in the generic case, where no continuous
subgroup of the original so(6) symmetry remains unbroken, the algebraic curve of the
corresponding solution is a riemann surface of genus seven. when some cycles shrink to
zero size the symmetry group is enhanced, whereas the genus of the riemann surface is
lowered accordingly. the uniformization of the curves is carried out explicitly and yields
various supersymmetric congurations in terms of elliptic functions. we also analyze
the ten-dimensional type-iib supergravity origin of our solutions and show that they
represent the gravitational eld of a large number of d3-branes continuously distributed
on hyper-surfaces embedded in the six-dimensional space transverse to the branes. the
spectra of massless scalar and graviton excitations are also studied on these backgrounds
by casting the associated dierential equations into schrodinger equations with non-
trivial potentials. the potentials are found to be of calogero type, rational or elliptic,
depending on the background conguration that is used.

1 introduction

ungauged and gauged n = 8 supergravities in ve dimensions were constructed several
years ago in [1] and [2, 3], following the analogous construction made in four dimensions in
[4] and [5]. more recently it has become clear that solutions of ve-dimensional gauged
supergravity play an important role in the context of the ads/cft correspondence
[6, 7, 8]. in particular the maximum supersymmetric vacuum state in ve-dimensional
gauged supergravity with ads5 geometry, originates from the ads5  s5 solution in
ten-dimensional type-iib supergravity. the latter solution arises as the near horizon
geometry of the solution representing the gravitational eld of a large number of coinci-
dent d3-branes and has been conjectured to provide the correct framework for analyzing
n = 4 supersymmetric su(n) yangmills for large n and t hooft coupling constant
at the conformal point of the coulomb branch.

the supergravity approach to gauge theories at strong coupling is applicable not only
at conformality, but also away from it. in particular, when the six scalar elds of the n =
4 supersymmetric yangmills theory acquire higgs expectation values we move away from
the origin of the coulomb branch and the appropriate supergravity solution corresponds
to a multicenter distribution of d3-branes with the centers, where the branes are located,
associated with the scalar higgs expectation values in the gauge theory side. a prototype
example of such d3-brane distributions is the two-center solution that has been studied
in [6, 9, 10], whereas examples of continuous d3-brane distributions arise naturally in the
supersymmetric limit of rotating d3-brane solutions [11, 12]. concentrating on the case
of continuous distributions, note that from a ten-dimensional type-iib supergravity view
point the so(6) symmetry, associated with the round s5-sphere, is broken because this
sphere is deformed. on the other hand, from the point of view of ve-dimensional gauged
supergravity the deformation of the sphere is associated with the fact that some of the
scalar elds in the theory are turned on. hence, nding solutions of ve-dimensional
gauged supersgravity might shed more light into the ads/cft correspondence as far as
the coulomb branch is concerned. using such solutions, investigations of the spectrum
of massless scalars excitations and of the quark-antiquark potential have already been
carried out with sometimes suprising results [13, 14, 15]. solutions of the ve-dimensional
theory are also important in a non-perturbative treatment of the renormalization group
ow in gauge theories at strong coupling [16, 17, 18, 19].

an additional motivation for studying solutions of ve-dimensional gauged supergrav-
ity is the fact that for a class of such congurations, four-dimensional poincare invariance
is preserved. it turns out that our four-dimensional space-time can be viewed as being
embedded non-trivially in the ve-dimensional solution with a warp factor. this par-
ticular idea of our space-time as a membrane in higher dimensions is quite old [20] and
has been recently revived with interesting phenomenological consequences on the mass
hierarchy problem [21]. in that work, in particular, our four-dimensional world was em-
bedded into the ads5 space from which a slice was cut out; it results into a normalizable
graviton zero mode, but also to a continuum spectrum of massive ones above it with no

1

mass gap separating them. the use of more general solutions of ve-dimensional gauged
supergravity certainly creates more possibilities and in fact there are solutions with a
mass gap that separates the massless mode from the massive ones [22].

this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we present a brief summary of some
basic facts about n = 8 ve-dimensional gauged supergavity with gauge group so(6).
in particular, we restrict our attention to the sector of the theory where only the metric
and the scalar elds associated with the coset space sl(6, ir)/so(6) are turned one. in
section 3 we nd the most general supersymmetric conguration in this sector, which as it
turns out, depends on six real moduli. our solutions have a ten-dimensional origin within
type-iib supergravity and represent the gravitational eld of continuous distributions of
d3-branes in hyper-surfaces embedded in the transverse space to the branes. in section 4
we further analyze our solution using some concepts from the theory of algebraic curves
and in particular riemann surfaces. we nd that our states correspond to riemann
surfaces with genus up to seven, depending on their symmetry groups, which are all
subgroups of so(6). in section 5 we provide details concerning the geometrical origin of
the supersymmetric states in ve dimensions from a ten-dimensional point of view using
various distributions of d3-branes in type-iib supergravity. this approach yields explicit
expressions for the metric and the scalar elds, and it can be viewed as complementary to
the algebro-geometric classication of section 4 in terms of riemann surfaces. in section
6 we consider massless scalar and graviton uctuations propagating on our backgrounds.
we formulate the problem equivalently as a schrodinger equation in one dimension and
compute the potential in some cases of particular interest. we also note intriguing
connections of these potentials to calogero models and various elliptic generalizations
thereof. finally, we end the paper with section 7 where we present our conclusions and
some directions for future work.

2 elements of ve-dimensional gauged supergravity

n = 8 supergravity in ve dimensions involves 42 scalar elds parametrizing the non-
compact coset space e6(6)/usp(8) that describes their couplings in the form of a non-
linear -model [1]. in ve-dimensional gauged supergravity the global symmetry group
e6(6) breaks into an so(6) subgroup which corresponds to the gauge symmetry group of
the resulting theory, and a non-trivial potential develops [2, 3]. in the framework of the
ads/cft correspondence [6, 7, 8] the supergravity scalars represent the couplings of the
marginal and relevant chiral primary operators of the n = 4 supersymmetric yangmills
theory in four dimensions. the invariance of the theory with respect to the gauge group,
as well as the sl(2, ir) symmetry inherited from type-iib supergravity in ten dimensions,
restricts the scalar potential to depend on 42153 = 24 invariants of the above groups.
however, it seems still practically impossible to deal with such a general potential. in
this paper we restrict attention to the scalar subsector corresponding to the symmetric
traceless representation of so(6), which parametrizes the coset sl(6, ir)/so(6), and

2

set all other elds (except the metric) equal to zero. in this sector we will be able to
nd explicitly the general solution of the classical equations of motion that preserves
supersymmetry.

the lagrangian for this particular coupled gravity-scalar sector includes the usual

einsteinhilbert term, the usual kinetic term for the scalars as well as their potential

(2.1)

a few explanations concerning the scalar-eld part of this action are in order. it has
been shown that in this subsector the scalar potential p depends on the symmetric
matrix sst only, where s is an element of sl(6, ir) [3] (for a recent discussion see also
[17, 13]). diagonalization of this matrix yields a form that depends only on ve scalar
elds. it is convenient, nevertheless, to represent this sector in terms of six scalar elds
i, i = 1, 2, . . . , 6 as [13]

useful for certain computational purposes.
it also has the property that if the elds
i are canonically normalized, the ve independent scalar elds i will be canonically

note that the 6  5 matrix that relates the auxiliary scalars i with the is is not
unique; it only has to satisfy the condition pi i = 0. the choice in (2.3) is particularly
normalized as well, i.e. p6

i=1(i)2 = 2p5

the form of the kinetic term for the scalars in (2.1) suggests that the metric in the
corresponding coset space is taken to be ij. this was explicitly shown for the case of only
one scalar eld in [17] and the general result was quoted without detailed explanation
in [13]. one can generally prove this statement by rst realizing that the kinetic term
of these scalars can depend on two type of terms, namely tr(ss 1)tr(ss 1) and
tr(ss 1ss 1). since ss 1 belongs to the algebra of sl(6, ir) the rst term is
zero because of the traceless condition. the second term gives a result proportional to
i=1(i)2, thus showing that the scalar kinetic term in (2.1) has indeed
the above form. the equations of motion follow by varying the action (2.1) with respect
to the ve-dimensional metric and the scalar elds. using the metric gm n , we have

(2.4)

there is a maximally supersymmetric solution of the above equations that preserves all
32 supercharges, in which all scalar elds are set zero and the metric is that of ads5
space. then, the potential in (2.2) becomes p = 3/r2 and equals by denition to the
negative cosmological constant of the theory. this denes the length scale r that will
be used in the following.

the coupled system of non-linear dierential equations (2.4) is in general dicult to
solve. in this paper we will be interested in solutions preserving four-dimensional poincare
invariance iso(1, 3). hence, we make the following ansatz for the ve-dimensional metric

ds2 = e2a(dxdx + dz2) ,

(2.5)

where  = diag(1, 1, 1, 1) is the four-dimensional minkowski metric and the conformal
factor e2a, as well as the scalar elds i, depend only on the variable z. in addition, we
demand that our solutions preserve supersymmetry. the corresponding killing spinor
equations, arising from the supersymmetry transformation rules for the 8 gravitinos and
the 42 spin-1/2 elds, give rise to the rst order equations [13]

and the derivative is taken with respect to the coordinate z. it is straightforward to check
that all supersymmetric solutions satisfying the rst order equations (2.6) also satisfy the
second order equations (2.4). in doing so, it is convenient to use the alternative expression
for the potential, instead of (2.2),

(2.8)

3 the general supersymmetric solution

we begin this section with the construction of the most general solution of the non-linear
system of equations (2.6) and discuss some of the general properties of the corresponding
supersymmetric congurations. we also show how our solution can be lifted to ten
dimensions in the context of type-iib supergravity.

3.1 five-dimensional solutions

it might still seem dicult to nd solutions of the coupled system of equations (2.6)
at rst sight, due to non-linearity. it turns out, however, that this is not the case, but

4

instead it is possible to nd the most general solution. in order to proceed further, we
rst compute the evolution of the auxiliary scalar elds i. using (2.3) and (2.6) we nd


i =

w + e2i(cid:19) = a +

r

e2i+a ,

i = 1, 2, . . . , 6 ,

(3.1)

where for the last equality we have used the rst equation in (2.6). this substitution
results into six decoupled rst order equations for the is which can be easily integrated,
as we will soon demonstrate. of course, after deriving the explicit solution for the i, we
also have to check the self-consistency of this substitution.

let us reparametrize the function a(z) in terms of an auxiliary function f (z/r2) as

follows

ea =

1
r

(f /2)1/3 .

(3.2)

we have included a minus sign in this denition since, according to the boundary condi-
tions that we will later choose, f will be a decreasing function of z. then, according to
this ansatz, the general solution of (3.1) is given by

e2i =

(f /2)2/3

f  bi

,

i = 1, 2, . . . , 6 ,

(3.3)

where the prime denotes here the derivative with respect to the argument z/r2. the bis
are six constants of integration, which, sometimes is convenient to order as

b1  b2  . . .  b6 ,

(3.4)

without loss of generality. note that we may x one combination of them to an arbitrary
constant value because (3.2) determines the function f up to an additive constant. also,
since the sum of the is is zero, we nd that the function f has to satisfy the dierential
equation

6

(f )2 = 4

(f  bi)1/2 ,
yi=1

(3.5)

which thus contains all the information about the supersymmetric congurations and
provides a non-trivial algebraic constraint. using (3.2), (3.3) and (3.5) one may easily
check that the rst equation in (2.6) is also satised.
if we insist on presenting the
solution in the conformally at form (2.5) the dierential equation (3.5) needs to be
solved to obtain f (z/r2). this will be studied in detail in section 4, as it is a necessary
step for investigating the massless scalar and graviton uctuations in section 6.

at the moment we present our general solution in an alternative coordinate system,
where f is viewed as the independent variable. indeed, using (3.5), we obtain for the
metric

ds2 =

f 1/6
r2 dxdx +

r2
4f 1/3 df 2 ;

f =

whereas the expression for the scalar elds in (3.3) becomes

(f  bi) ,

(3.7)

e2i =

5

i = 1, 2, . . . , 6 .

when the constants bi are all equal, our solution becomes nothing but ads5 with all
scalar elds turned o to zero. in the opposite case, when all constants bi are unequal
from one another, there is no continuous subgroup of so(6) preserved by our solution.
if we let some of the bis to coincide we restore various continuous subgroups of so(6)
accordingly. as for the ve scalar elds i, they can be found using (2.3)

(1 + 2  3  4) ,

(1 + 4  2  3) ,

note that imposing the reality condition on the scalars in (3.7) restricts the values of
f to be larger that the maximum of the constants bi, which according to the ordering in
(3.4) means that f  b1. for f  b1 the scalars tend to zero and f  f 6, in which case
the metric in (3.6) approaches ads5 as expected; put dierently, in this limit f  1/z
close to z = 0 that is taken as the origin of the z-coordinate. for intermediate values of
f we have a ow in the ve-dimensional space spanned by all scalar elds i. in general
we may have b1 = b2 = . . . = bn, with n  6, when b1 is n-fold degenerate. in this case,
the solution preserves an so(n) subgroup of so(6) and the ow is actually taking place
in 6  n dimensions. on the other hand, let us consider the case when f approaches its
lower value b1. then, the scalars in (3.7) are approaching

where f0 = q6

i=n+1(b1  bi). consequently, we have a one-dimensional ow in this limit
since the scalar elds i can be expressed in terms of a single (canonically normalized)

(3.12)

hence, at  = 0 (or equivalently at f = b1) there is a naked singularity which has
an interpetation, as we will see later in the ten-dimensional context, as the location of a
distribution of d3-branes. it is instructive to compare this with the singular behaviour of
non-conformal non-supersymmetric solutions found in [23]. a similar naked singularity
was found there, but the corresponding metric near the singularity had a power law
behaviour in  with exponent equal to 1/2, which coincides with the result in (3.12) only
for n = 2.

3.2 type-iib supergravity origin

it is possible to lift our solution with metric and scalars given by (3.6) and (3.7) to a
supersymmetric solution of type-iib supergravity, where only the metric and the self-
dual ve-form are turned on. this proves that our ve-dimensional solution is a true
compactication of type-iib supergravity on s5. this is not a priori obvious because
unlike the case of the s7 compactication of eleven-dimensional supergravity to four
dimensions [24], there is no general proof that the full non-linear ve-dimensional gauged
supergravity action can be fully encoded into the action or equations of motion of the
type-iib supergravity for the s5 compactication. however, there is a lot of evidence
that this is indeed the case and our result gives further support in its favour.

we will show that the ten-dimensional metric corresponds to the gravitational eld of
a large number of d3-branes in the eld theory limit with a special continuous distribution
of branes in the transverse six-dimensional space. namely, the metric has the form

ds2 = h 1/2

0

dxdx + h 1/2

0

(dy2

1 + dy2

2 + . . . + dy2

6) ,

(3.13)

where h0 is a harmonic function (yet to be determined) in the six-dimensional space
transverse to the brane parametrized by the yi coordinates. however, instead of being
asymptotically at, the metric (3.13) will become asymptotically ads5  s5 for large
radial distances (or equivalently in the uv region using the terminology of the ads/cft
correspondence). the ten-dimensional dilaton eld is constant, i.e. e = gs = const. and,
as usual, the self-dual ve-form is turned on. under these conditions, the ten-dimensional
solution breaks half of the maximum number of supersymmetries (see, for instance, [25]).

we proceed further by rst performing the coordinate change in (3.13)

yi = reai xi = (f  bi)1/2 xi ,

i = 1, 2, . . . , 6 ,

(3.14)

i = 1. various convenient
bases for these unit vectors can be chosen, depending on the particular applications that

where the xis dene a unit ve-sphere, i.e. they obey p6

transverse part of the brane metric (3.13) can be written as

it can be shown that the at six-dimensional metric in the

det g = vol(s5)

e2i x2

i .

6

xi=1

(3.15)

(3.16)

for later use, we have also written the expression for the determinant of the deformed
ve-sphere in (3.16). in computing this determinant we have used the fact that the sum
of the is is zero. note that a similar expression also holds for a general n-sphere.

the harmonic function h0 is determined by comparing the massless scalar equation
210 = 0 for the ten-dimensional metric (3.13) with the equation arising using the ve-
dimensional metric (2.5), i.e. 25 = 0. in both cases one makes the ansatz that the
solution does not depend on the sphere coordinates, i.e.  = eikx(z). since the solutions
for the scalar  should be the same in any consistent trancation of theory, the resulting
second order ordinary dierential equations should be identical. a comparison of terms
proportional to (z) determines the function h0 as follows,

h 1

(3.17)

where in the second equality the harmonic function h0 has been expressed in terms of
the transverse coordinates yi. comparison of the terms proportional to the rst and
second derivative of (z) yields, using the expression for det g in (3.16), an identity
and provides no further information. the coordinate f is determined in terms of the
transverse coordinates yi as a solution of the algebraic equation

6

xi=1

y2
i

f  bi

= 1 .

(3.18)

this is a sixth order algebraic equation for general choices of the constants bi, and its
solution cannot be written in closed form. however, this becomes possible when some
of the bis coincide in such a way that the degree of (3.18) is reduced to four or less.
even then, the resulting expressions are not very illuminating and we will refrain from
presenting them except in the simplest case in section 5 below.

the corresponding d3-brane solution that is asymptotically at is obtained by re-
placing h0 in (3.13) by h = 1 + h0. then, in this context, the length parameter r
has a microscopic interpretation using the string scale , the string coupling gs, and the
(large) number of d3-branes n, as r4 = 4gsn2.

in the rest of this section we demonstrate for completeness the proof that the function
h0, as dened in (3.17), is indeed harmonic in the six-dimensional transverse space

8

spanned by yi, i = 1, 2, . . . , 6. this is not a trivial check since f that appears in (3.17)
is itself a function of the transverse space coordinates yi due to the condition (3.18). for
notational convenience we dene the functions

am =

6

xi=1

y2
i

(f  bi)m ,

bm =

6

xi=1

(f  bi)m .

then, using (3.18) we determine the derivative of the function f (y)

also, the rst derivative of h0 with respect to yi turns out to be

taking the derivative with respect to yi once more, summing over the free indices and
after some algebraic manipulations, we obtain the desired result

4 riemann surfaces in gauged supergravity

in this section we will present the basic mathematical aspects of our general ansatz for the
supersymmetric conditions of ve-dimensional gauged supergravity and nd the means to
obtain explicit solutions in several cases by appealing to methods of algebraic geometry.
in fact, we will classify all possible solutions according to symmetry groups (subgroups
of so(6)) and use the uniformization of algebraic curves that result in this approach for
deriving the corresponding expressions. to simplify matters the parameter r will be set
equal to 1, but it can be easily reinstated by appropriate scaling in z.

4.1 schwarzchristoel transform

a useful way to think about the dierential equation for the unknown function f (z) is
in the context of complex analysis. suppose that z and f are extended in the complex

9

domain and let us consider a closed polygon in the z-plane, including its interior, and map
it via a schwarzchristoel transformation onto the upper half f -plane. this provides
a one-to-one conformal transformation and it is assumed that f (z) is analytic in the
polygon and is continuous in the closed region consisting of the polygon together with
its interior. considering the behaviour of dz and df as the polygon is transversed in the
counter-clockwise direction, we know that the transformation is described as

dz
df

= a(f  b1)1/(f  b2)2/    (f  bn)n/ ,

(4.1)

where a is some constant that changes by rescaling f . the vertices of the polygon are
mapped to the points b1, b2,   , bn on the real axis of the upper complex f -plane and
the exponents i that appear in the transformation are the exterior (deection) angles
of the polygon at the corresponding vertices. when the polygon is closed their sum is
1 + 2 + . . . + n = 2. of course, without loss of generality, we may take one point (say
bn) to innity. letting a = b/(bn)n/ we see that as bn   the schwarzchristoel
transformation becomes

dz
df

= b(f  b1)1/(f  b2)2/    (f  bn1)n1/ ,

(4.2)

where b is another constant factor. to make contact with our problem we choose n = 7
and let the angles 1 = 2 =    = 6 = /4. then, we arrive at the dierential equation

df!4
  dz

= b4(f  b1)1(f  b2)1    (f  b6)1 ,

(4.3)

which is the same as the one implied by our ansatz for the general solution of gauged
supergravity (with b = 1/2).

the solutions of this equation are dicult to obtain in practice for generic values of
the moduli bi. we will investigate this problem in connection with the theory of algebraic
curves in c 2 and we will see that in many cases explicit solutions can be given using the
theory of elliptic functions. before proceeding further we note that in our formulation
we are looking for the map from the interior of the polygon onto the upper half-plane,
f (z), and not for the inverse transformation.

4.2 symmetries and algebraic curves

if we extend the variable z to the complex domain, as before, and set

x = 4f (z) ,

y = 4f (z) ,

i = 4bi ,

the schwarzchristoel dierential equation will become an algebraic curve in c 2,

y4 = (x  1)(x  2) . . . (x  6) .

(4.4)

(4.5)

this is a convenient formulation for nding solutions of the supersymmetry equations,
but at the end we have to restrict to real values of z and demand that the resulting

10

supergravity elds i are also real. for generic values of the parameters bi, so that they
are all unequal and hence there is no symmetry in the solution of ve-dimensional gauged
supergravity, the genus of the curve can be easily determined (like in any other case) via
the riemannhurwitz relation. recall that for any curve of the form

ym = (x  1)1(x  2)2 . . . (x  n)n ,

(4.6)

which is reduced, i.e. the integers m and i have no common factors, and all is are
unequal, the genus g can be found by rst writing the ratios

1
m

=

,

n
m

1 +    + n

in terms of relatively prime numbers and then using the relation

g = 1  m +

m
2

n

xi=0(cid:18)1 

1

ci(cid:19) .

(4.7)

(4.8)

according to this the genus of our surface turns out to be g = 7 when all bi are unequal,
and so it is dicult to determine explicitly the solution in the general case. however,
by imposing some isometries in the solution of gauged supergravity the genus becomes
smaller and hence the problem becomes more tractable. the presence of isometries
manifests by allowing for multiple branch points in the general form of the algebraic
curve, which in turn degenerates along certain cycles that eectively reduce its genus.

note for completeness that if we had not taken b7 to innity in our discussion of the
schwarzchristoel transformation, we would have had an additional factor (x  7)2 in
the equation of the algebraic curve because 7 = /2 instead of /4 that was chosen for
the remaining is. it can be easily veried that this does not aect the genus of the
curve, as expected on general grounds.

next, we enumerate all possible cases with a certain degree of symmetry that corre-
spond to various subgroups of so(6); this amounts to various deformations of the round
ve-sphere, s5, which is used for the compactication of the theory from 10 to 5 dimen-
sions. consequently, this will in principle determine the solution for the scalar elds in
the remaining 5 dimensions as we will see later in detail. if all the branch points are
dierent, the so(6) isometry of s5 will be completely broken, whereas if all of them
coalesce to the same point the maximal isometry so(6) will be manifestly present. the
classication is presented below in an order of increasing symmetry or else in decreasing
values of g.

(1) so(2): it corresponds to setting two of the i equal to each other and the remaining
are all unequal. the curve becomes

y4 = (x  1)(x  2)(x  3)(x  4)(x  5)2

(4.9)

and its genus turns out to be g = 5.

(2) so(3): it corresponds to setting three of the i equal and all other remain unequal.
the curve becomes

y4 = (x  1)(x  2)(x  3)(x  4)3

(4.10)

11

and the genus turns out to be g = 4.
(3) so(2)  so(2): in this case two pairs of i are mutually equal and the remaining
two parameters are unequal. the curve becomes

y4 = (x  1)(x  2)(x  3)2(x  4)2

(4.11)

and its genus is g = 3.
(4) so(3)  so(2): in this case three i are equal and another two are also equal to
each other. the curve becomes

y4 = (x  1)(x  2)2(x  3)3

(4.12)

and its genus is g = 2. therefore we know that it can be cast into a manifest hyper-elliptic
form by introducing appropriate bi-rational transformations of the complex variables.

(5) so(4): it corresponds to setting four i equal to each other and the other two remain
unequal. the curve becomes

y4 = (x  1)(x  2)(x  3)4

(4.13)

and its genus is g = 1. it can also be cast into a manifest (hyper)-elliptic form as we will
see shortly.
(6) so(2)  so(2)  so(2): it corresponds to three dierent pairs of mutually equal i,
but in this case the curve is not irreducible, since y4 = (x  1)2(x  2)2(x  3)2. the
reduced form is

y2 = (x  1)(x  2)(x  3)

(4.14)

and clearly has genus g = 1 as it is written directly in (hyper)-elliptic form.
(7) so(3)  so(3): in this case we have two groups of triplets with equal values of i.
the curve becomes

y4 = (x  1)3(x  2)3

(4.15)

and its genus is g = 1. it can also be cast into a manifest (hyper)-elliptic form.

(8) so(5): in this case ve i are equal to each other and the last remains dierent. the
curve becomes

y4 = (x  1)(x  2)5

(4.16)

and its genus is also g = 1 as before.
(9) so(4)  so(2): it corresponds to separating the i into four equal and another two
equal parameters. the curve becomes y4 = (x  1)2(x  2)4, but it is not irreducible.
the reduced form is

and has genus g = 0, as it can also be obtained by degenerating a genus 1 surface along
its cycles. therefore, we expect the solution to be given in terms of elementary functions.

y2 = (x  1)(x  2)2

(4.17)

12

(10) so(6): this is the case of maximal symmetry in which all i are set equal to each
other. the curve becomes y4 = (x  1)6, whose reduced form is

y2 = (x  1)3

(4.18)

and has genus g = 0 as before.

of course, when certain cycles contract by letting various branch points to coalesce,
the higher genus surfaces reduce to lower genus and a bigger symmetry group emerges
in the solutions corresponding to gauged supergravity. for genus g  2 one can always
transform to a manifest hyper-elliptic form so that two sheets (instead of four) are needed
for picturing the riemann surface by gluing sheets together along their branch cuts. we
will investigate in detail the cases corresponding to genus 0 and 1 surfaces since the so-
lutions can be given explicitly in terms of elementary and elliptic functions respectively.
some results about the genus 2 case will also be presented. the other cases are more dif-
cult to handle in detail even though the general form of the solution is known implicitly
for all g according to our ansatz.

4.3 genus 0 surfaces

there are two genus 0 surfaces according to the previous discussion, namely the curve
y2 = (x  1)3 for the isometry group so(6) and the curve y2 = (x  1)(x  2)2 for
the isometry group so(4)  so(2). according to algebraic geometry every irreducible
curve f (x, y) = 0 with genus 0 is representable as a unicursal curve (straight line)

w = v

(4.19)

by means of a bi-rational transformation x(v, w), y(v, w) and conversely v(x, y), w(x, y).
in our two examples the underlying transformations are summarized as follows:

(a) so(6): we have

and conversely

x = vw + 1 ,

y = vw2

v =

(x  1)2

y

,

w =

y

x  1

.

(b) so(4)  so(2): we have

x = vw + 1 ,

y = w(vw + 1  2)

and conversely

v =

(x  1)(x  2)

y

,

w =

.

of course, the rst curve arises as special case of the second for 2  1.

y

x  2

13

(4.20)

(4.21)

(4.22)

(4.23)

for general 1 and 2 we may use u as a (trivial) uniformizing complex parameter

for the unicursal curve, i.e. v = u = w. then, the expressions for x and y yield

4f (z) = u2 + 4b1 ,

4

df (z)

dz

= u(cid:16)u2 + 4(b1  b2)(cid:17) ,

(4.24)

where we have taken into account the rescaling x = 4f (z), y = 4f (z), i = 4bi that was
introduced earlier. so we can determine u as a function of z by simple integration since

du
dz

=

1

2 (cid:16)u2 + 4(b1  b2)(cid:17) .

(4.25)

in fact there are three dierent cases for generic values of b1 and b2. choosing appropri-
ately the integration constant, so that the resulting conformal factor e2a(z) will behave
like 1/z2 as z  0, we have:

(i)

(ii)

u = 2qb1  b2cot(cid:18)qb1  b2z(cid:19) ,
u = 2qb2  b1coth(cid:18)qb2  b1z(cid:19) ,

for b1 > b2 ,

(4.26)

for b2 > b1 ,

(4.27)

(iii) u = 

2
z

,

for b1 = b2 .

(4.28)

the rst two cases correspond to the so(4) so(2) isometry and they are obtained by
analytic continuation from one other, depending on the size of the bis, whereas the last
case has so(6) isometry. here, we do not assume any given ordering among the bis. as
for the functions f (z) we have respectively

f (z) = (b1b2)cot2(cid:18)qb1  b2z(cid:19)+b1 ,

(b2b1)coth2(cid:18)qb2  b1z(cid:19)+b1 ,

1
z2 +b1 . (4.29)

then, the expression for the conformal factor of the metric is

(i)

e2a(z) = (b1  b2)

(ii)

e2a(z) = (b2  b1)

(iii)

e2a(z) =

1
z2 ,

,

cos2/3(cid:16)b1  b2z(cid:17)
sin2(cid:16)b1  b2z(cid:17)
cosh2/3(cid:16)b2  b1z(cid:17)
sinh2(cid:16)b2  b1z(cid:17)

for b1 > b2 ,

(4.30)

,

for b2 > b1 ,

(4.31)

for b1 = b2 ,

(4.32)

which indeed behaves as 1/z2 in all three cases for z  0.

the solution for the scalar elds i(z) of ve-dimensional gauged supergravity follows

by simple substitution into our ansatz. we have explicitly in each case

(i)

e21(z) = e22(z) =

1

cos4/3(cid:16)b1  b2z(cid:17)

,

14

e23(z) = e24(z) = e25(z) = e26(z) = cos2/3(cid:18)qb1  b2z(cid:19) ,

(ii)

e21(z) = e22(z) =

1

cosh4/3(cid:16)b2  b1z(cid:17)

,

(4.33)

(4.34)

(4.35)

e23(z) = e24(z) = e25(z) = e26(z) = cosh2/3(cid:18)qb2  b1z(cid:19) ,

(iii)

e2i(z) = 1 ,

i = 1, . . . , 6 .

equally well we could have transformed the genus 0 curves into the quadratic form

y 2 = 1  x 2 using the following transformation for the curve y2 = (x  1)(x  2)2

x =

1 + x
1  x

+ 1 ,

y =

y

1  x (cid:18) 1 + x
1  x

+ 1  2(cid:19)

(4.36)

and conversely

x =

x  1  1
x  1 + 1

,

y =

.

(4.37)

2y

(x  1 + 1)(x  2)

in this case we can use another uniformizing complex parameter u, so that x = sinu and
y = cosu, and proceed as above. either way, the uniformization problem is solved in
terms of elementary functions, which in turn determine the function f (z) every time and
hence the particular supersymmetric solutions of ve-dimensional gauged supergravity.

4.4 genus 1 surfaces

recall rst that given a genus 1 algebraic curve in its weierstrass form

w2 = 4v3  g2v  g3

(4.38)

the uniformization problem is solved by introducing the weierstrass function p(u) and
its derivative p (u) with respect to a complex parameter u. then, v = p(u) and w =
p (u) in which case the weierstrass function satises the time independent kdv equation
p (u)  12p(u)p (u) = 0. the two periods of the elliptic curve are denoted by 21 and
22 and the weierstrass function is double periodic with respect to them. also the values
of the weierstrass function at the half-periods coincide with the roots of the algebraic
equation 4v3  g2v  g3 = 0, namely e1 = p(1), e2 = p(1 + 2) and e3 = p(2).
conversely, given the dierential equation

dz !2
  dg(z)

= 4g3(z)  g2g(z)  g3

(4.39)

the general solution is described in terms of the weierstrass function g(z) = p(z + a),
where a is the constant of integration and g2, g3 are related as usual to the periods of
the elliptic curve. this may be seen by taking a new dependent variable u dened by
the equation g = p(u), when the dierential equation reduces to (du/dz)2 = 1; for this

15

recall that the number of roots of the equation p(u) = c that lie in any cell depend
only on p(u) and not on c, which can assume arbitrary values, like for any other elliptic
function.

we have four dierent curves with genus 1 that follow from the classication that we
described above. it is known from algebraic geometry that any genus 1 surface is hyper-
elliptic (in particular elliptic since g = 1), but we see that only the one that corresponds
to the case of so(2)  so(2)  so(2) isometry is essentially written in such form with
roots e1 = 1, e2 = 2 and e3 = 3 (when 1 + 2 + 3 = 0). the other three curves
can be transformed to w2 = 4v3  g2v  g3 for appropriately chosen coecients g2 and
g3 provided that one performs the necessary bi-rational transformations of the complex
variables v(x, y), w(x, y) and conversely x(v, w), y(v, w). only then the solution can
be easily deduced from the resulting genus 1 curve in its weierstrass form using elliptic
functions. this is precisely what we are about to describe in the sequel.

note rst that all three curves that correspond to the symmetry groups so(4),

so(3)  so(3) and so(5) can be transformed into the same curve

according to the following bi-rational transformations

y 4 = (x  1)(x  2)

x = x ,

y =

x = x ,

y =

x = x ,

y =

respectively. then, dening

y

for y4 = (x  1)(x  2)(x  3)4 ,

(4.40)

(4.41)

(4.42)

(4.43)

(4.44)

we arrive at the curve 2(1   2) = (1  2) 3 in all three cases. this simplies further
by dening new variables v , w so that

 =

w
v

,

 + 1 =

1
v

,

(4.45)

in which case the curve becomes w 2(2v  1) = (1  2)v (1  v )3. finally, letting

we obtain the genus 1 curve in its standard weierstrass form

w2 = 4v3  g2v  g3

with g2 =

1
4

(1  2)2 , g3 = 0

(4.46)

(4.47)

for all three cases of interest. this is a non-degenerate riemann surface with g = 1, but it
is more special than the so(2) so(2) so(2) surface since the latter depends on three

16

parameters 1, 2 and 3 instead of the two 1 and 2 that appear in the weierstrass
form for higher (non-abelian) symmetry. actually, in the present case we have 2/1 = i,
and so by introducing the modulus of elliptic integrals, k, and its complementary value
k, one nds k = k = 1/2.

we summarize the bi-rational transformations that are needed to transform each one
of the genus 1 surfaces into their weierstrass forms according to the symmetry groups of
the solutions that they represent:
(a) so(2)  so(2)  so(2): the curve y2 = (x  1)(x  2)(x  3) can be brought
into the standard weierstrass form w2 = 4v3  g2v  g3 with

1

g2 =

36 (cid:16)(1 + 2  23)2  (2 + 3  21)(1 + 3  22)(cid:17) ,

note that in the three last cases (b)(d) one may choose v = p(u) and w = p (u),
where u is the uniformizing parameter of the same riemann surface. thus, the xs
(= 4f (z)) are the same functions of u in these three cases, given in terms of weierstrass
functions and their derivatives, but the ys (= 4f (z)) are all dierent as can be readily
seen. this simply means that the variable z is not equal to the uniformizing parameter
u of the genus 1 curve in its weierstrass form, but rather a more complicated function
u(z) that has to be found in each case separately by integration (in analogy with what
we did in the g = 0 cases). this complication does not arise for the case (a), since there
we can take z = u (more generally (du/dz)2 = 1, as we have already seen). for (a) the
solution has already been very simply expressed in terms of the weierstrass functions
x = 4p(u) + (1 + 2 + 3)/3 and y = 4p (u), though of another riemann surface with
dierent coecients g2 and g3.

next, we take into account the eld redenitions x = 4f (z), y = 4f (z), i = 4bi and
solve for z(u) and its inverse u(z), when this is possible in closed form, thus determining
f (z) in each case of interest. of course, the elliptic functions that appear, refer to the
corresponding curves with g2 and g3 determined as above. summarizing the results,
including some technical details, we have:
 so(2)  so(2)  so(2): we have already seen that the uniformizing parameter u
equals to z and hence

(4.59)

(4.60)

according to this we nd

f (z) = p(z) +

1
3

(b1 + b2 + b3) .

e2a(z) = (cid:18)1

2p (z)(cid:19)2/3

,

and so the conformal factor of the metric behaves as 1/z2 when z approaches 0. the
solution for the scalar elds of gauged supergravity follows by substitution into our general
ansatz. we have in fact

e21(z) = e22(z) =

e23(z) = e24(z) =

e25(z) = e26(z) =

(p (z)/2)2/3
p(z)  e1
(p (z)/2)2/3
p(z)  e2
(p (z)/2)2/3

where

ei = bi

(b1 + b2 + b3) ,

i = 1, 2, 3.

(4.62)

18

 so(3)  so(3): this is the next simple case to consider. the relation between the
dierentials dz and du can be found by rst computing 4df/du as a function of u; it
turns out to be p 3(u)/4p 3(u). then, using the expression for y = 4df (z)/dz we arrive
at the simple relation

du
dz

1
2

= 

(4.63)

(4.64)

(4.65)

and so u = z/2, up to an integration constant that is taken zero. consequently,

f (z) = b1 

1

4p(z/2)

(p(z/2) + b1  b2)2 ,

which in turn implies the following result for the conformal factor of the metric

4p(z/2)!2
e2a(z) =   p (z/2)

=

1

4  p(z/2) 

(b1  b2)2
p(z/2) ! .

the derivative of the weierstrass function is taken with respect to its argument z/2.
the conformal factor clearly approaches 1/z2 as z  0, which justies our choice of the
integration constant above.

as for the solution corresponding to the scalar elds of gauged supergravity, we obtain

by substitution into our general ansatz the result

e21(z) = e22(z) = e23(z) = p(z/2)  b1 + b2
p(z/2) + b1  b2
e24(z) = e25(z) = e26(z) = p(z/2) + b1  b2
p(z/2)  b1 + b2

,

,

(4.66)

which completes the task. at this point we add a clarifying remark, which takes into
account the discrete symmetry x  x and bi  bi of the underlying algebraic curves.
the uniformization that gave rise to eq. (4.64) implies that as z ranges from 0 to 21, f (z)
ranges from  to b2 (provided that b1 > b2 so that p(1)  e1 = b1b2). if one applies
the discrete symmetry mentioned above, eq. (4.64) will change accordingly so that f (z)
will range from + to b1 (taken as the maximum of the two moduli parameters). this
particular symmetry implies in turn that the expressions for the scalar elds exp(2i)
get modied by simply changing the overall sign according to the dening relation (3.3).
hence, despite appearances, the elds i(z) are real provided that z is real with values
in the range where f (z) is bigger than the maximum of b1 and b2, as it is usually taken.
 so(5): this case is computationally more dicult to handle. since 4df/du =
p 3/4p 3(u) again as a function of u, we nd the following relation between the dif-
ferentials dz and du,

then, integrating over u we arrive at the formula

du
dz

=

2

p(u)  b1 + b2

similar remarks apply here for the overall sign appearing in eq. (4.72), as for the scalar
elds of the model so(3)  so(3), using the discrete symmetry x  x, bi  bi of
the underlying algebraic curve.

we mention for completeness that as b1  b2 the riemann surface degenerates and
it might seem that this
one recovers the so(6) model that was already discussed.
contradicts the relation between u and z at rst sight, since the left hand side becomes
zero irrespective of z. however, for elliptic functions in the degeneration limit g2 = g3 = 0
we have p(u) = 1/u2 and (u) = 1/u for all u, and so the right hand side also becomes
zero irrespective of u; hence there is no problem in taking this limit.
 so(4): in this situation the calculation becomes even more involved. we nd that

(4.73)

but as in the so(5) case it is still not possible to nd explicitly u(z) in closed form.
besides, the integrals are more dicult to perform when b2 6= b3 and so the resulting
expressions are not very illuminating in terms of algebraic geometry. we postpone the
presentation of the corresponding conguration for the next section, where a more geo-
metrical approach is employed for it.

4.5 genus 2 surface

here we have only one such curve corresponding to the isometry group so(3)  so(2),
which is described by the algebraic equation y4 = (x  1)(x  2)2(x  3)3. according
to algebraic geometry it can be brought into a manifest hyper-elliptic form by perform-
ing appropriate bi-rational transformations. to achieve this explicitly we consider the
following sequence of transformations: first, let

x = x ,

y =

(x  3)(x  2)

y

,

that brings the curve into the form

(x  1)y 4 = (x  2)2(x  3) .

the second step consists in performing the transformation

x  2 =
that transforms it further into the form

2


,

y =




,

2(1   2) = (1  2) + (2  3) 3 .

next, we introduce v and w so that

 =

w
v

,

 + 1 =

1
v

,

and the algebraic curve simplies to

w 2(2v  1) = (1  2)v 3(1  v ) + (2  3)v (1  v )3 .

finally, as last step let us consider

v = v ,

w =

w

2v  1

,

which turns the curve into the desired hyper-elliptic form of genus two

w2 = v(v  1)(2v  1)(cid:16)(3  1)v2  2(3  2)v + 3  2(cid:17) ,

with ve distinct roots when all i are dierent from each other.

(4.77)

(4.78)

(4.79)

(4.80)

(4.81)

summarizing the sequence of the above operations, which are similar to the genus 1

examples, we have for the transformation x(v, w), y(v, w) the nal result

x = 2 

(3  1)v2  2(3  2)v + 3  2

2v  1

,

y = (1  3)

vw

(2v  1)2 ,

(4.82)

whereas for its inverse v(x, y), w(x, y) we have

v =

(x  2)(x  3)2
(x  2)(x  3)2 + y

,

(x  2)(x  3)2  y2
(x  2)(x  3)2 + y2 ,

and so it is bi-rational, as required. these formulae are useful for addressing the uni-
formization problem of the original form of the curve in terms of theta functions. how-
ever, the resulting solution for gauged supergravity is rather complicated in this algebro-
geometric context and we postpone its presentation for the next section using a dierent
approach.

before concluding this section note that the so(3)  so(3) model, which arises as
1  2, corresponds in this context to the curve w2 = (3  2)v(v  1)3(2v  1), which
according to the riemannhurwitz relation has genus 1 as required; letting w  w(v1),
we see that the cubic form w2 = (3  2)v(v  1)(2v  1) results in this case. also,
the so(5) model arises as 2  3 and it corresponds in this context to the curve
w2 = (2  1)v3(v  1)(2v  1), which again has genus 1, as required; it transforms,
in turn, into the cubic form w2 = (2  1)v(v  1)(2v  1) under the transformation
w  wv. last, the so(4) so(2) model is described by w2 = (2  1)v(v 1)(2v  1)2
as 1  3. this has genus 0 and it can be brought into a manifest quadratic form
w2 = (2 1)v(v 1) using the transformation w  w(2v 1). however, the bi-rational
transformation for y is appearing singular now, and the same is also true for the fully
symmetric so(6) model; notice that for both of them the original form of the curve is not
irreducible. hence, we assume that the so(3) so(2) model has 1, 2, 3 all dierent
from each other (in particular 1 6= 3). in any event, all previous models with genus 0
and 1 arise as special cases of so(3)  so(2) apart from the so(2)  so(2)  so(2)
and the so(4) models that have already been described.

5 examples

the ve- as well as the ten-dimensional forms of our solutions preserve four-dimensional
poincare invariance iso(1, 3) along the three-brane, but for general values of the con-
stants bi, they have no other continuous isometries. in order to obtain some continuous
group of isometries we have to choose some of the bis equal. by means of (3.7) the
corresponding scalars i are also equal to one another.
in this section we work out
explicitly the expression for the metric and the scalar elds for some cases of partic-
ular interest using the ten-dimensional geometric frame where f is more conveniently
regarded as a coordinate instead of using z. we will present the models with isometry
groups so(3)  so(2) and its limiting cases so(3)  so(3) and so(5), as well as the
cases with isometry groups so(2)  so(2)  so(2), so(4) and their limiting model
so(4)  so(2). they describe all solutions with genus  2 from the point of view
of the previous section. the examples are ordered by starting from the more general
congurations and then specializing to models with higher symmetry.

the variable z is more natural to use for addressing the uniformization problem of the
algebraic curves underlying in our solutions. in here, we adapt our presentation to the
ten-dimensional type-iib supergravity description for two reasons: rst as an alternative
method for constructing explicit forms of our supersymmetric congurations, and second

22

for providing a higher dimensional view point for the compactication to ve space-
time dimensions, and naturally for questions regarding the ads/cft correspondence.
to avoid confusion note that certain choices of the moduli bi made in the sequel dier
slightly from those made in the previous section, but this should cause no problem.

5.1 solutions with so(3)  so(2) symmetry
in this case it is convenient to use a basis for the unit vectors xi that dene the ve-
sphere in such a way that it is in one to one correspondence with the decomposition of
the vector representation 6 of so(6) with respect to the subgroup so(3)  so(2), as
6  (3, 1)  (1, 2)  (1, 1). hence, we choose
x3! = cos  sin   cos 1
  x2
sin 2 ! ,
x5! = sin  sin    cos 2
  x4

sin 1 ! ,

x1 = cos  cos  ,

x6 = sin  cos  .

(5.1)

it is also convenient to choose the constants bi as follows

b1 = b2 = b3 = 0 ,

b4 = b5 = l2
1 ,

b6 = l2
2 ,

(5.2)

where l1 and l2 are real constants, thus ordering now the moduli bi in an increasing order
according to (3.4). we moreover adopt the change of variable f = r2 with r  0, which
is legitimate as bmax = 0. then, the corresponding ten-dimensional metric takes the form

ds2 = h 1/2dxdx + h 1/2

the metric (5.3) has a singularity at r = 0 where the harmonic function h diverges.
however, this is not a point-like singularity as it occurs for all possible values of the
angular variables ,  and 2. hence, (5.3) may be interpreted as representing the
distribution of a large number of d3-branes inside a solid three-dimensional ellipsoid
dened by the equation

(5.8)

and the three-dimensional hyper-plane y1 = y2 = y3 = 0. we note that, by analytic
continuation on the lis we may obtain brane distributions other than (5.8), but we will
not elaborate more on this point.

5.2 solutions with so(3)  so(3) symmetry
in this case we may obtain the metric by just setting l1 = l2  l in (5.3), since then the
symmetry is enhanced, from so(3)  so(2) to so(3)  so(3). the metric becomes

ds2 = h 1/2dxdx + h 1/2 r2 + 2 cos2

+ h 1/2h(r2 + l2 cos2 )d2 + r2 cos2 d2

where the harmonic function h that follows from the corresponding expression in (5.4)
is

h = 1 +

(5.10)

and the two dierent line elements for the two-dimensional sphere appearing in (5.9) are

d2

d 2

2 = d2 + sin2 d2
2 .

(5.11)

the eld theory limit form of the metric (5.9) (with the 1 omitted in (5.10)) has appeared
before in [13].

in the description in terms of gauged supergravity, the ve-dimensional metric (3.6)

takes the form

ds2 =

r(r2 + l2)1/2

r2

r2
r2 + l2 dr2

(5.12)

and the expressions for the scalars (5.7) simplify to

e24 = e25 = e26 =  1 +

,

l2

(5.13)

note that the ve-dimensional metric, as well as the corresponding scalar elds, take the
equivalent form (4.65) and (4.66), respectively, when written in terms of the variable z.

specializing (5.8) to the case at hand with l1 = l2 = l, we deduce that the metric
(5.9) represents the distribution of a large number of d3-branes inside the solid three-
dimensional ball

y2
4 + y2

5 + y2

6 = l2 ,

(5.14)

in the three-dimensional hyper-plane dened by y1 = y2 = y3 = 0.

5.3 solutions with so(5) symmetry

in this case we may obtain the metric by just setting l1 = 0 (and also redening l2  l)
in (5.3), since then the symmetry is enhanced from so(3)  so(2) to so(5). however,
in order to present a metric with manifest so(5) symmetry, the basis (5.1) is not ap-
propriate. a convenient basis for the unit vectors xi should be such that it is in one to
one correspondence with the decomposition of the vector representation 6 of so(6), with
respect to so(5), as 6  5  1. hence we choose

sin 1 ! ,
x2! = cos  sin   cos 1
  x1
x4! = cos  cos  sin   cos 2
  x3

sin 2 ! ,

x5 = cos  cos  cos  ,

x6 = sin  .

the metric becomes

ds2 = h 1/2dxdx + h 1/2 r2 + l2 cos2 

r2 + l2

dr2

where the harmonic function is

4i ,
+ h 1/2h(r2 + l2 cos2 )d2 + r2 cos2 d2

2) .

(5.18)

the eld theory limit form of the metric (5.16) (with the 1 omitted in (5.17)) has also
appeared before in [13].

the ve-dimensional metric (3.6) takes the form

ds2 =

r5/3(r2 + l2)1/6

r2

dxdx +

r2

r4/3(r2 + l2)1/3 dr2 ,

(5.19)

e26 =  1 +

r2!5/6

l2

r2!1/6

,

(5.20)

the singularity of the metric (5.16) for r = 0 may be interpreted as due to the
presence of d3-branes distributed along the y6 axis. this can be also obtained from
(5.8) in the limit l1  0 (and l2  l). in this limit, y4 and y5 are forced to be zero and
therefore imposing (5.8) leads to y6 = l. hence, the distribution of d3-branes is taken
over a segment of length l.

5.4 solutions with so(2)  so(2)  so(2) symmetry
in this case it is convenient to use a basis for the unit vectors xi that dene the ve-sphere
in such a way that it corresponds to the decomposition of the vector representation 6
of so(6) with respect to the full cartan subgroup so(2)  so(2)  so(2), as 6 
(2, 1, 1)  (1, 2, 1)  (1, 1, 2). hence, we choose

sin 1 ! ,
x2! = sin   cos 1

where ai, i = 1, 2, 3 are some real constants.

the metric (5.23), together with the dening relations (5.24), corresponds to the super-
symmetric limit of the most general non-extremal rotating d3-brane solution [26]. using
this interpretation, it turns out that a1, a2 and a3 correspond to the three rotational pa-
rameters of the solution, after a suitable euclidean continuation. we also note that the
metric (5.23) corresponds to the extremal limit of the three-charge black hole solution
found in [27], in ansaetze for solutions to n = 8, d = 5 gauged supergravity preserving
an u(1)3 subgroup of so(6) [28].

then, the dierential equation (3.5) has as solution the weierstrass elliptic function p
(5.28)

f (z) = p(z/r2) ,

which is the same as (4.59) after ignoring the irrelevant additive constant. the invariants
of the curve that dene the weierstrass elliptic function p are

g2 = 4(e1e2 + e2e3 + e3e1) ,

g3 = 4e1e2e3 .

with (4.61).

5.5 solutions with so(4)  so(2) symmetry
these solutions can be obtained by letting e2 = e3 (equivalently a2 = a3) into the various

assuming that r2
0 > 0, we nd that the metric (5.34) has a singularity at r = r0 and
 = 0. this is not a point-like singularity as it occurs for general values of , 2 and 3.
it describes the situation where the horizon of the non-extremal metric coincides with
the singularity as one approaches the extremal limit. the singularity of the metric (5.34)
can be interpreted as arising from the presence of d3-branes distributed on a spherical
shell [11, 12] dened in the y1 = y2 = 0 hyper-plane by the equation

y2

(5.39)

in the case that e1 = e2 (equivalently a2 = a1) it turns out that the previous results
apply with r2
1 < 0. it is then appropriate to dene a new positive parameter by
just letting r2
0. then, the singularity of the metric (5.34) occurs at r = 0 and may
be interpreted as coming from the presence of d3-branes distributed over a disc [11, 12],
whose boundary is dened in the y3 = y4 = y5 = y6 = 0 hyper-plane by the circle

it is instructive to recover the metric of ve-dimensional gauged supergravity cor-
responding to our solution as a limiting case of (5.33), in analogy with the limiting

29

description of the ten-dimensional metric (5.34). to comment on this, let us rst con-
sider the limiting case e3 = e2 (or equivalently a3 = a2), where the modulus k  0 and
the elliptic curve degenerates along the a-cycle. then, using the well known properties
of the jacobi functions cnu  cos u, snu  sin u and dnu  1, that are valid for k  0,
we obtain from (5.33) that the conformal factor in the corresponding ve-dimensional
metric (2.5) is given by

e2a =

r2
0
r2

cos2/3(r0z/r2)
sin2(r0z/r2)

,

(5.41)

where the variable u in (5.32) becomes u = r0/r2z, with r2
2, when a3 =
a2. another limiting case arises when e2 = e1 (or equivalently a2 = a1), in which the
complementary modulus k  0 and the elliptic curve degenerates along the b-cycle.
then, using the properties of the jacobi functions for k  0 we have cnu  1/ cosh u,
snu  tanh u and dnu  1/ cosh u. from (5.33) we obtain that the conformal factor of
the corresponding ve-dimensional metric (2.5) becomes

where we have used the fact that the variable u in (5.32) becomes u = r0/r2z, with r0
now dened as r2
3, when a2 = a1. we note that the conformal factors appearing
in (5.41) and (5.42) are the same as those found before in [22]. they are also precisely
the same factors as those appearing in (4.30) and (4.31) by appropriate identication of
the parameters and after reinstating the scale factor r into the equations.

the metric (5.44) has a singularity at r = 0, where the harmonic function h in (5.45)

the symmetry is enhanced from so(4) to so(4)  so(2). then, the expressions for
the metric (5.44) and the scalars elds (5.47) coincide with those found in (5.34) and
(5.38) respectively using the identication r2

becomes zero, the symmetry is enhanced from so(4) to so(5) and by a suitable change
of coordinates one recovers the results of subsection 4.3.

6 spectrum for scalar and spin-two elds

in this section we investigate the problem of solving the dierential equations for the
massless scalar eld as well as for the graviton uctuations in our general ve-dimensional
background metric (2.5). we formulate the problem in terms of an equivalent schrodinger
equation in a potential that depends on the particular background. later in this section
we will discuss explicitly some cases of particular interest and determine the exact form
of the corresponding potentials.

6.1 generalities

we begin with the massless scalar eld equation 25 = 0 in the background geometry
(2.5). in the context of the ads/cft correspondence, the solutions and eigenvalues of
this equation have been associated with the spectrum of the operator trf 2 [29, 7, 30].
on the other hand, the uctuations of the graviton polarized in the directions parallel to
the brane are associated with the energy momentum tensor t on the gauge theory side
[29, 7, 30]. a priori, one expects that the spectra of the two operators trf 2 and t are
dierent. however, as was shown in [22], when graviton uctuations on a three-brane

31

embedded in a ve-dimensional metric as in (2.5) are considered, the two spectra and
the corresponding eigenfunctions coincide. in particular, in order to study the graviton
uctuations, the minkowski metric  along the three-brane is replaced in (2.5) by
 + h and then the equations of motion (2.4) are linearized in h. reparametrization
invariance allows to gauge-x ve functions.
 = 0, where
indices are raised and lowered using  and its inverse, the graviton uctuations obey
the equation 25h = 0, which is the same equation as that for a scalar eld [22] (the
same observation has been made in a slightly dierent context in [31]). hence, the spectra
for the operators trf 2 and t indeed coincide. in what follows,  will denote either a
massless scalar eld or any component of the graviton tensor eld.

in the gauge h

 = h

we proceed further by making the following ansatz for the solution

(x, z) = exp(ik  x)(z) ,

(6.1)

which represents plane waves propagating along the three-brane with an amplitude func-
tion that is z-dependent. the mass-square is dened as m 2 = kk. using the expression
for the metric in (2.5), we nd that the equation for (z) is

 + 3a + m 2 = 0 .

(6.2)

this equation can be cast into a schrodinger equation for a wavefunction (z) dened
as  = e3a/2. we nd

with potential given by

  + v  = m 2 ,

v =

a2 +

9

a .

(6.3)

(6.4)

so far our discussion is quite general and applies to all solutions of the system of equations
(2.4). when the solutions are supersymmetric we may use (3.2), (3.3) and (3.5) to nd
alternative forms for the potential, namely

v =

(6.5)

this expression for the potential depends, of course, on the variable z through the func-
tion f (z). even without having knowledge of the explicit z-dependence of the potential,
we may deduce some general properties about the spectrum in the various cases of in-
terest. further details will be worked out in the following subsection using the results of
section 4.

in general, f takes values between the maximum of the constants bi (which according
to the ordering made in (3.4) is taken to be b1) and +. when f  , the ve-
dimensional space approaches ads5 and the potential becomes

v 

15f
4r4 ,

as f   ,

32

(6.6)

and hence it is unbounded from above. let us now consider the behaviour of the potential
close to the other end, namely when f  b1. consider the general case where b1 appears
n times, as in the corresponding discussion made at the end of subsection 3.1. using (6.5)
we nd that the potential behaves (including the subscript n to distinguish the various
cases) as

f 1/2
0
16r4 n(3n  8)(f  b1)

vn 

n

2 2 ,

as f  b1 ,

(6.7)

with f0 being a constant given, as before, by f0 = qi(b1 bi). hence, for the value n = 6,

corresponding to ads5 the potential goes to zero and the spectrum is continuous. the
same is true for the value n = 5 corresponding to the so(5) symmetric model. for the
case n = 4 the potential approaches a constant value with the metric given by (5.44).
using the denitions (5.43), the general expression for the the minimum value of the
potential is in this case

v4,min =

l1l2
r4 .

(6.8)

therefore, although the spectrum is continuous, it does not start from zero, but there is
a mass gap whose value squared is given by the minimum of the potential in (6.8). for
the so(4) so(2) model, where the metric is given by (5.34) with r2
0 < 0, the existence
of a mass gap has already been proven in [13, 14]. for n = 3 the potential goes to +
as f  b1 and therefore the spectrum is not continuous but discrete. quite generally
we may show, using simple scaling arguments, that the typical unit of mass square is
0 /r4.
6n
f
0
for n = 2 the potential goes to  and there is the danger that it is unbounded from
below. nevertheless, at least for the so(4)  so(2) symmetric model with metric given
by (5.34) with r2

/r4. hence, for n = 3, we expect that m 2 will be quantized in units of f 1/3

0 > 0, it was shown before that m 2 is discrete and positive [13, 14].

6.2 examples of potentials

6.2.1

so(6)

let us consider rst the massless scalar equation for the most symmetric case, namely
when the background is given by the ads5 metric itself. in this case we have ea = r/z
and the potential becomes

v (z) =

15
4z2 ,

0  z <  ,

(6.9)

which obviously has a continuous spectrum for m 2. the corresponding schrodinger
equation can be transformed into a bessel equation and the result for the amplitude of
the uctuations (6.1) is given by

m = (mr)3/2(mz)2j2(mz) ,

(6.10)

where j2 is the bessel function of index 2, which is regular at the origin z = 0. the
arbitrary overall constant is chosen so that the dirac-type normalization condition is

33

satised

z 

0

dze3am m  = (m  m ) .

(6.11)

the measure factor e3a in the integrand of the equation above is such that the schrodinger
wave function  = e3a/2 obeys a normalization condition similar to (6.11), but with
measure 1.

6.2.2

so(4)  so(2)

consider now the rst non-trivial case with metric given by (5.34) with r2
0 > 0. the
spectrum for massless scalar and graviton uctuations has already been analyzed in
[13, 14] and [22], respectively. we include this case here not only for completeness, but
also because we will make connections with calogero-type models later. the explicit
form for the potential turns out to be

v (z) =

(6.12)

and clearly possesses the features we have discussed at the begining of this section. in
fact (6.12) belongs to a family of potentials called poschlteller potential of type i in
the literature of elementary quantum mechanics. the solution for the massless scalar or
graviton uctuations is given by (6.1) with the quantized amplitude modes being given
by [14]

r2 = cos(2r0z/r2) , n = 0, 1, . . . ,

(6.13)
where in general p (,)
denote the classical jacobi polynomials. note that the arbitrary
overall constant in (6.13) has been chosen so that the ns are normalized to 1 with
measure e3a, similar to (6.11), where a is now given by (5.41). the associated mass
spectrum is

n

n =

4r2

r4 (n + 1)(n + 2) ,

n = 0, 1, . . . .

(6.14)

let us now turn to the case of the metric (5.34) with r2

0 < 0 and replace r2

0 by r2
0.

then, the potential takes the form (also given in [22])

v (z) =

r2

r4  1 +

1

4 cosh2(r0z/r2)

+

15

4 sinh2(r0z/r2)! ,

0  z <  ,

(6.15)

which is the so called poschlteller potential of type ii. note that this potential is related
to the one appearing in (6.12) by analytic continuation r0  ir0, as expected. this
0/r4 as z   and therefore its spectrum is continuous,
potential approaches the value r2
but with a mass gap given by [13, 14]

m 2

gap =

r2
0
r4 .

34

(6.16)

in this case the solution for the massless scalar and the graviton uctuations is given by
(6.1) with amplitude

q  x(q1)/2fq(x)  x(q+1)/2fq(x) ,

0  x =

r2

r2 + r2

=

cosh2(r0z/r2)  1 . (6.17)

the constant q and the function fq(x) are related to the mass m via hypergeometric
functions as

fq(x) = f(cid:16)q  1

2

,

q  1
2

, 1 + q; x(cid:17) ,

q = 1  r2m 2 .

(6.18)

note that the constant q is purely imaginary due to the mass gap of the model.

6.2.3 so(2)  so(2)  so(2)
since this case has not been discussed in the literature, we will explain the derivation of
the potential v (z) in some detail. using the variable u = z/r2, for simplicity, we nd
according to the denition that the potential becomes

v (u) =

1

16r4p 2(u) 3

p(u)  e3!2

(p(u)  e1)2 

p(u)  e2
4

p(u)  e1
4
(p(u)  e2)2 

(p(u)  e3)2!,

(6.19)

where e1 + e2 + e3 = 0 for the roots of the corresponding elliptic curve. then, using the
addition theorem for the weierstrass function we have

1

p 2(u)

(p(u)  e1)2 +

p 2(u)
4  
(p(u)  e3)2! =
3p(u) + p(u + 1) + p(u + 2) + p(u + 1 + 2)

(p(u)  e2)2 +

p 2(u)

(6.20)

and so a straightforward calculation yields the nal result

v (z) =

1

4r4 (cid:18)15p(cid:18) z

r2(cid:19)  p(cid:18) z

r2 + 1(cid:19)  p(cid:18) z

r2 + 2(cid:19)  p(cid:18) z

r2 + 1 + 2(cid:19)(cid:19)

(6.21)

with the dependence on r appearing now explicitly.

it is easy to see how the degeneration of the curve leads to the rational potential of the
so(4)  so(2) model. recall that for e1 6= e2 = e3, i.e. for elliptic modulus k = 0, the
a-cycle of the riemann surface shrinks to zero size and the weierstrass function simplies
to

p(u) = 

3g3
2g2

+

9g3
2g2

1

2g2(cid:17)
sin2(cid:16)uq 9g3

.

(6.22)

in this limiting case we have 9g3/2g2 = a2
parameters of our ten-dimensional solution. since this combination equals to r2

2, whereas a2 = a3, using the rotational
0, we

1  a2

35

obtain the trigonometric function sin(r0z/r2).
in this limit we also have 1 = /2r0
and 2 = i, and so p(u + 1) will involve the function cos(r0z/r2), while the terms
originating from p(u + 2) and p(u + 1 + 2) contribute only to the constant. in this
fashion we recover the potential of the so(4) so(2) model. its hyperbolic counterpart
appears when r2
0 < 0 and so the new potential can be obtained by suitable analytic
continuation.

note nally that in the general case the potential becomes innite at the weierstrass
points 0, 1, 2, 1 + 2, because the weierstrass function blows up at 0 modulo the
periods; put dierently, some term of the potential becomes innite at each one of these
points. unfortunately, we do not have complete grasp of the spectrum for the schrodinger
equation in this potential. we hope that its computation will be discussed elsewhere.

6.2.4 so(3)  so(3)
this case also leads to a new form for the potential that has not been investigated before.
again, using for simplicity the parameter u = z/(2r2), since for r = 1 the uniformizing
parameter is u = z/2, and the minus sign plays no role in v , we have for our solution
(with general r)

v (u) =

3

p 2(u) 
p(u) + b1  b2!2
256r4 p 2(u)
 p(u)  b1 + b2


p(u)  b1 + b2!2
+ p(u) + b1  b2

+ 18
 .

(6.23)

this follows by substitution of our algebro-geometric solution into the dening relation
of the potential, after reinstating the r-dependence. the elliptic curve has presently
g3 = 0 and so e2 = 0, e1 = e3. by employing the identities, special to this surface,

p (u + 1) = 2e2

1

p (u)

(p(u)  e1)2 ,

p (u + 2) = 2e2

3

p (u)

(p(u)  e3)2 ,

(6.24)

where e2
potential

1 = e2

3 = (b1  b2)2, we arrive after some calculation at the nal result for the

(6.25)


 .

note that this potential also becomes innite at the four weierstrass points, but
its structural dependence on elliptic functions seems to be dierent from the previous
example. however, making use of some further identities (special to the curves with
g3 = 0), it can be cast into a form proportional to

15

(6.26)

which is invariant under shifts with respect to 1 + 2. we leave the computation of the
spectrum for the corresponding schrodinger equation to future investigation, as before.

36

for the other examples we have been unable to derive the form of the potential
in closed form, because there are no closed formulae for the solutions in terms of the
variable z that appears naturally in the corresponding schrodinger equation, or else in
the algebro-geometric description of the various models as riemann surfaces. we close
this section with some general remarks concerning the rational and elliptic variations of
calogero-like models.

6.3 comments

it is rather amusing that the schrodinger problem one has to solve in z is of calogero type.
this is a characteristic feature of ads5 and possibly of more general ads spaces. for the
maximally symmetric so(6) model, in particular, the potential is precisely v (z) = 1/z2
(up to an overall scale) (6.9). it can be seen that the solutions of the less symmetric
so(4)  so(2) model are also related to a calogero problem, namely the three-body
model in one dimension. recall that the quantum states of the general three-body
problem can be found by solving the time independent schrodinger equation

for i 6= j 6= k, where the xis describe the coordinates of the three particles and g, f
denote the strength of the two-body and three-body calogero interactions respectively.
in fact, from a group theory point of view, this potential describes couplings between
the particles according to the root system of the simple lie algebra g2. introducing the
center of mass coordinates

2 rsin = x1  x2 , 6 rcos = x1 + x2  2x3 ,

3rcm = x1 + x2 + x3 ,

(6.28)

one obtains, after moding out the rcm-dependence, a dierential equation for the wave-
function (r, ). it can be separated, as usual, into two independent equations for the
radial and angular dependence of the wavefunctions

where 2 is the separation constant, (r, ) = x(r)(), and e is now the energy in
the center of mass frame [32]. of course, the hamiltonian is hermitian provided that the
coupling constants g  1/4 and f  1/4. for f = 0 only two-body interactions are
present in the problem.

the integrability of the classical calogero model persists quantum mechanically and
helps us to determine its spectrum and wave eigenfunctions. in particular, the dierential

equation for the angular dependence is solved in general as follows,

n() = sin1(3)cos2(3)p 11/2,21/2

(6.31)

(6.32)

the angle  assumes the values between 0 and /6; because of its dependence on the
cartesian coordinates xi, a particular value of  gives a specic ordering of the three
particles and hence the problem can be divided into sectors depending on the range of
. for a general overview of these issues, see for instance [33] and references therein.
interestingly enough, the schrodinger problem that arose in studying the spectrum of
quantum uctuations for scalar and spin-two elds in the background of the so(4) 
so(2) model of ve-dimensional gauged supergravity ts precisely into the integrable
class of such calogero potentials with 1 = 5/2 and 2 = 1/2, which thus attains its
minimum value required by hermiticity. note, however, that presently 1 6= 2. to
make exact contact with our problem for the so(4)  so(2) model, rst introduce the
necessary rescaling with respect to r, setting 3 = r0z/r2, and then conclude that the
mass spectrum is given in general by

m 2

n =

n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,

(6.33)

as there is also a constant term which is present now that shifts the energy levels. for
the values 1 = 5/2 and 2 = 1/2 the spectrum (6.33) coincides with that in (6.14).

on the other hand, the elliptic generalization of the 1/z2 potential arose historically
more than a century ago in connection with the problem of nding ellipsoidal harmonics
for the 3-dim laplace equation. when one deals with physical problems connected to
ellipsoids, like having sources with a general ellipsoidal distribution, the mathematical
structure of spheres, cones and planes usually associated to polar coordinates gets re-
placed by the structure of confocal quadrics. since the transformation from cartesian
coordinates is not singled valued, elliptic functions are employed for its proper descrip-
tion. introducing uniformizing parameters associated with confocal coordinates, it turns
out that the solutions of laplaces equation are obtained by separation of variables, in
which case one arrives at the lame equation

 

d2

dz2 + n(n + 1)p(z)  e! (z) = 0

(6.34)

for harmonics of degree n; e is a separation constant that appears in the mathematical
analysis of the problem (for details see [34]). it is interesting to note that this particular
schrodinger problem was fully investigated much later in connection with nite zone
potentials, riemann surfaces and the kdv hierarchies (see for instance [35] and references

38

therein), since the weierstrass function satises the time independent kdv equation. it
comes as no surprize that potentials consisting of weierstrass functions also arise in our
study, because the relevant congurations can be obtained from distributions of d3-
branes on ellipsoids in ten dimensions, as it has already been noted in the geometrical
setting of our solutions. in this sense, all potentials that occur in the supergravity models
with genus g > 0 should be considered as appropriate generalizations of the original
derivation of lames equation in a ten-dimensional iib framework.

multi-particle systems with two-body interactions described by p(zi  zj) have also
been studied extensively as integrable systems [33]. however, the trigonometric identities
used earlier for expressing sin3 and cos3 in terms of sin and cos for the rational
three-body calogero model, thus arriving at a separation of the angular  dependence,
are not generalizable to elliptic functions. hence, there is no analogous understanding of
the schrodinger equation that determines the spectrum of scalar and spin-two elds in
the ve-dimensional background of our elliptic congurations using many-body elliptic
calogero systems. to the best of our knowledge, the specic quantum problems that
arise here have not been investigated and pose a set of interesting questions for future
work.

we mention for completeness that the only problem which has been studied in de-
tail among the class of potentials given by a sum of weierstrass functions concerns the
schrodinger equation with

n

v (z) = 2

xi=1 p(z  zi(t))

(6.35)

when zi(t) are moduli that evolve in time as elliptic calogero particles with two-body
interactions only, namely

(6.36)

d2zi(t)

dt2 = 4xi6=j p (zi  zj) .

such systems are naturally encountered in the description of elliptic solutions of the kp
equation, in analogy with the rational solutions of the kp equation where the ordinary
1/z2 calogero models make their appearance (see for instance [36]). a static solution is
easily obtained by considering four such particles located at the corners of a parallelogram
inside the fundamental domain of elliptic functions described by the points z1 = 0,
in this case, their dierences zi  zj equal to
z2 = 1, z3 = 2 and z4 = 1 + 2.
half-periods (modulo the periods) for all i 6= j, so the derivative of the weierstrass
function vanishes there and the elliptic calogero equations are trivially satised. then,
the potential for the schrodinger equation becomes

v (z) = 2 (p(z) + p(z + 1) + p(z + 2) + p(z + 1 + 2)) ,

(6.37)

which by the way equals to 8p(2z) and reduces to the usual lame equation with n = 1
after rescaling z. the generalization to potentials consisting of similar weierstrass terms
but with more arbitrary relative coecients, as in the so(2) so(2) so(2) model, or
as in the so(3)  so(3) model, remain open for study and we hope to return elsewhere
in view of their relevance in ve-dimensional gauged supergravity.

7 conclusions

in this paper we have analyzed the conditions for having supersymmetric congurations
in ve-dimensional gauged supergravity in the sector where only ve scalar elds, as-
sociated with the coset space sl(6, ir)/so(6), are turned on apart from the metric.
these conditions were integrated using an ansatz for the conformal factor of the ve-
dimensional metric in terms of a function f (z), and the scalar elds were subsequently
determined provided that a certain non-linear dierential equation for the function f (z)
could be solved. this approach provides a natural algebro-geometric framework in which
riemann surfaces and their uniformization play a prominent role. a key ingredient was
the interpretation of the non-linear dierential equation for f (z) as a schwatzchristoel
transformation by extending the range of parameters to the complex domain. in fact,
the general solution depends on six real moduli, which when they start coalescing lead to
congurations with various symmetry groups. the case with maximal symmetry so(6)
corresponds to the maximally supersymmetric solution of ads5 with all scalar elds set
equal to zero. more generally, we have classied all such algebraic curves according to
their genus, and associated symmetry groups (all being subgroups of so(6)). we also
made use of their uniformization for nding explicit forms of the supersymmetric states
in terms of elliptic functions. the calculations have been carried out in detail for the
models of low genus, but they can be extended to all other cases with higher genus (or
else smaller symmetry groups).

there is an alternative description of our solutions in terms of type-iib supergravity
in ten dimensions, which is a natural place for discussing solutions of ve-dimensional
gauged supergravity via consistent truncations. this higher dimensional point of view is
also interesting for addressing various questions related to the ads/cft correspondence
and supersymmetric yang-mills theory in four space-time dimensions. we found that
the algebraic classes of our ve-dimensional congurations could be understood as rep-
resenting the gravitational eld of a large number of d3-branes continuously distributed
on hypersurfaces embedded in the six-dimensional space that is transverse to the branes.
the geometry of these hypersurfaces is closely related to the riemann surfaces under-
lying in the algebro-geometric approach, as the distribution of d3-branes is taken to be
in the interior of certain ellipsoids for the corresponding elliptic solutions. also, as more
and more scalar elds are turned on, the geometry of the ve-dimensional sphere that
appears in the ten-dimensional description of our states (together with the remaining ve
dimensions which are asymptotic to ads5 space) becomes deformed and respects less and
less symmetry from the original so(6) symmetry group of the round s5. in this geo-
metrical approach, there is no need to perform the uniformization of riemann surfaces,
as the metric is formulated in another frame with f (z) being the coordinate variable in-
stead of z. the schwarzchristoel transform describes precisely this particular change
of coordinates, when it is restricted to real values. then, the calculation reduces to
nding appropriate harmonic functions that correspond to the continuous distribution of
d3-branes. in any event, both approaches are equivalent to each other and complement

40

nicely the classication of the supersymmetric states that has been considered.

finally, we have examined the spectra of the massless scalar and graviton elds on
these backgrounds and found that they can be determined by a schrodinger equation in
one dimension, which is z, with a potential that depends on the conformal factor of the
ve-dimensional metric. it is rather curious that all these potentials are essentially of
calogero type. in the fully symmetric so(6) model, whose solution represents ads5, the
potential is 1/z2, which is a characteristic feature of calogero systems. for other models
with less symmetry, the potential turns out to be either a rational form of calogero
interactions or elliptic generalizations thereof depending on each case. such generalized
potentials were not investigated in the literature before and there are many questions
that are left open concerning their integrability properties and the exact determination
of the spectrum. we think that supersymmetric quantum mechanics could help to make
progress in this direction.

it will be also interesting to consider in future study the precise characterization of
all these states in connection with the representation theory of the complete supersym-
metry algebra. shrinking cycles that lower the genus of our algebraic curves and lead
to enhancement of the symmetry group of the various models should have an interesting
interpretation in more traditional terms, using the representations of supersymmetry and
the associated multiplets. moreover, the extention of our techniques to other theories of
gauged supergravity, in particular in higher dimensions, seems possible and we hope to
return to all these elsewhere.
