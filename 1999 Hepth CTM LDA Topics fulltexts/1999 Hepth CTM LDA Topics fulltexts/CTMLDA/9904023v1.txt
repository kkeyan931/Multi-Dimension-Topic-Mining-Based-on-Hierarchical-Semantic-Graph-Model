abstract

it has been assumed that it is possible to approximate the interactions of
quantized bps solitons by quantising a dynamical system induced on a mod-
uli space of soliton parameters. general properties of the reduction of quan-
tum systems by a born-oppenheimer approximation are described here and
applied to sigma models and their moduli spaces in order to learn more about
this approximation. new terms arise from the reduction proceedure, some
of them geometrical and some of them dynamical in nature. the results are
generalised to supersymmetric sigma models, where most of the extra terms
vanish.

i. introduction

in most physical problems, the degrees of freedom that are of interest are only a small
fraction of the total number of degrees of freedom present. some kind of reduction of the
system has been performed. the way in which this reduction proceeds from quantum eld
theory to a moduli space of topological solitons is the subject of this paper.

soliton solutions can give rise to particle states [1] and it has been predicted that their
low-energy interations can be reduced to a simplied quantum mechanical problem in a set
of collective coordinates [2,3]. one way in which this can be used is to indicate a duality
between two quantum theories, where the soliton particle states in one theory become the
fundamental particles in an equivalent quantum theory. a particular example can be seen
in the monopole bound states which are important for the duality between the large and
small coupling constant limits of the heterotic string theory [4].

in a range of dierent models there are classical multiple-soliton solutions that saturate
bogomolnyi bounds and are parameterised by moduli. when the solitons move slowly and
interact they deform adiabatically and the moduli trace out a path in a moduli space. the
equations governing the path are equivalent to the equations for a point particle moving on
a curved space [5,6].

we would expect to be able to describe the interactions of quantized solitons by quan-
tising the dynamical system induced on the moduli space. we will call this proceedure
truncation. however, the quantisation rules of the truncated theory are often ambiguous
without additional assumptions. if we impose general covariance, reecting the freedom to
choose coordinates on the moduli space, then the hamiltonian operator takes the form

 1

2 + r + . . .

(1)

where  is the laplacian on the moduli space and ambiguities are reduced to the coecients
 of the ricci scalar r and other curvature invariants [7]. these ambiguities can be further
reduced by introducing supersymmetry, in which case it has been argued that  = 0 [8,9].

in this paper we describe the alternative to truncating the full theory, which is to reduce
it by a born-oppenheimer approximation.
in a purely bosonic theory we will see that
general covariance breaks down in the sense that a potential arises on the moduli space after
integrating out the uctuations that are orthogonal to the moduli space.

in the basic situation we begin with a classical dynamical system in at space which
has a potential v with a set of degenerate minima m. we nd that the original quantum
theory reduces to a quantum theory on m with hamiltonian

hr =  1

2 m + u + 1

4rm  1

8 |k|2 + + . . .

(2)

the two purely geometrical terms depend on the intrinsic curvature scalar rm and the
(traced) extrinsic curvature ki. these geometrical terms where rst written down by
maraner [10]. the dynamical terms denoted by u depend upon derivatives of the potential.
those depending on up to two extrinsic derivatives of the potential can be written

u = 1

2tr() + 1

16 tr(cid:16)1k  1k(cid:17)

(3)

where  is a matrix, 2 is the hessian matrix of v and the covariant derivative is taken
tangentially to m.

2

the application of these results to sigma models is considered in section 3.

in these
models the original conguration space, consisting of maps from physical space to a curved
target space, is both innite and curved. the innities can be dealt with by regularisation.
the curvature would lead in general to ambiguities even before the reduction. however, as
shown in appendix a, these ambiguities are not present if the original space is a riemannian
symmetric space. most models of interest fall into this class.

the results are generalised to supersymmetric sigma models in section 4. the point
at issue is whether the reduction leads to a superpotential on the moduli space and alters
the hamiltonian operator. we nd that, to leading order, the theory reduces to the hodge
laplacian acting on p  f orms,

hr =  1

2 m + . . .

(4)

conrming previous expectations [8,9,3]. possible developments of this work are addressed
in the conclusion, where we also discuss the advantages of the hamiltonian approach over a
feynmann diagram approach.

ii. born-oppenheimer reduction

consider a classical dynamical system in at space which has a degenerate set of stable
points m. if the potential is suciently steep, then energy spectrum of the quantum system
typically falls into seperate bands. an adiabatic approximation scheme can then be used to
reduce the quantum system to a quantum system on m.

we shall retrict attention to the case where the potential has an analytic expansion about
its minima. we take a set of generalised coordinates (xa, xi) such that xi = 0 on m. in the
lowest energy bands, the value of xi uctuates over a narrow range of values determined by
the eigenvalues of a matrix , where

2 = i j v.

(5)

the expansion parameter of the approximation scheme is given by the width of an energy
band divided by the smallest eigenvalue.

the rst step is to rewrite the hamiltonian operator,

h =  1

2  + v

(6)

in the new coordinate system. we choose normal coordinates xi along the principal direc-
tions of ij v . it is always possible to nd two mutually orthogonal sets of derivatives a
and i, where

a = a  n i

ai.

this implies that the metric can be written

g = abdxadxb + ij (dxi + n i

adxa)(dxj + n j

bdxb).

the metric components have normal coordinate expansions

(7)

ij = ij

a = aj
ab = ab + 2ki abxi + ki ackj b

axj

cxi xj

(9)
(10)
(11)

where the extrinsic curvature ki and the torsion ai
j are dened in appendix b. these
expansions are exact if the space is at, but we will keep in mind the possibility of generalising
these results to curved spaces.

in the new coordinate system, the hamiltonian becomes

h = 1

2|g|1/2 a|g|1/2ab b + 1

2|g|1/2i|g|1/2ij j + v

(12)

we regard the xi as small and expand the hamiltonian as a series of terms h = h0+h1+. . ..
the potential has a series expansion

v = 1

2(2)ij xixj + 1

6vijkxixj xk + . . .

(13)

where ij is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues i. the rst few terms in the full hamil-
tonian are then

h0 =  1
h1 =  1
h2 =  1

2 iji j + 1
2 tr(ki)i + 1

2tr(ki kj )xi j + 1

24 vijklxi xj xkxl

(14)

(15)

(16)

the dot denotes a scalar product using the intrinsic metric on m. we have introduced a
covariant derivative da, where daab = 0 and

daf = (a + aj

i

axj j )f

(17)

for scalar functions f .

the next step is to apply degenerate perturbation theory. we take the unperturbed har-
monic oscillator hamiltonian h0 together with a set of states fn, where h0fn = enfn. the
perturbation theory is described in appendix c and gives a reduced hamiltonian operator
hr acting on the space of wave functions (xa),

hr = hh0i00 + hh1i00 + hh2i00 + xm6=0

the matrix elements dened by

hh1i0m (e0  em)1 hh1im0 + o(1)

(18)

hhinm = z fn h fm yi

dxi

(19)

are allowed to be operator-valued.

the rst term hh0i00 consists of the vacuum energy of the system of unperturbed har-

monic oscillators (14),

e0 = 1

2tr().

4

(20)

the second term hh1i00 vanishes because the operator is odd under the inversion xi  xi .
for the next term hh2i00, with h2 given by equation (16), we set

hdaimn = mnka + haaimn

(21)

where ka is dened in appendix b and a arises form the action of da on the states fn in
equation (19). the matrix element of the derivative of an energy eigenstate is given by a
standard identity,

haaimn =

([da, h0])mn

en  em

(22)

after using equation (17) for d, and comparing with equation (b7), the commutator pro-
duces a covariant derivative,

haaimn = (cid:26) 1

2kaij hxixj imn em < en

m = n

.

we can now evaluate

hd  di00 = m  1

8tr(cid:16)1k  1k(cid:17)

where the covariant laplacian m = k  k. we also have, using (b8),

htr(ki kj )xi j i00 = 1

2tr(ki ki) = 1

2|k|2  1

2rm

where |k|2 = tr(ki)tr(ki). therefore we get

the vacuum energy, which is of order , is the dominant term in this expression. the next
term depends on the gradient of the normal mode frequencies along the moduli space and
includes the eects of the twisting, or torsion, of the normal mode directions. the remaining
terms contain the eects of higher derivatives of the potential.

the geometrical terms where discovered in the restricted situation of a surface embedded
in r3 by jensen and koppe [11] and more generally by maraner [10]. the covariant forms
for the dynamical terms beyond the obvious vacuum energy term are new, as far as we know.

5

iii. bosonic field theory

the non-linear sigma-model in two space dimension x and one time dimension t has
elds i taking values in a curved target space t . we will take the lagrangian to be
l = t  v , where

t =

v =

1

2 z gijtitj d2x
2 z gijij d2x

1

(30)

(31)

depending upon the topology of t , the classical eld equations can have static solutions
with nite energy, or topological solitons. these solutions minimise the potential energy for
a given topological class.

when t is a compact kahler manifold the soliton solutions can be represented by holo-
morphic maps from the complex plane into t [6,12,13]. they depend on a continuous set of
parameters, or moduli, which can be interpreted as the positions and charges of individual
lumps.

the initial situation is similar to the models considered in the previous section, except
that the conguration space is no longer nite and at. the introduction of curvature leads
to the appearance of curvature invariants in the initial schrodinger equation. however,
we will take the target space to be a riemannian symmetric space. the space of elds
inherits this symmetry and is also a riemannian symmetric space. in this case the curvature
invariants are constants which can be absorbed into an overall phase factor.

the soliton solutions 0 will be parameterised by a set of coordinates xa belonging to
the moduli space. we shall expand the lagrangian about these solutions using standard
background eld methods [14] and express the result in terms of time-dependent coordinates
xa and normal coordinates xi . this will enable us to use the results of the previous section.
the tangent vector  to the geodesic from  to 0 provides a convenient measure of the

displaced eld. we also introduce the vectors e with target space components

e

i = i

(32)

these can be parallel transported back from the tangent space at  to the tangent space
at 0 to produce a eld e. the tangent vector  commutes with e, and consequently
e = d, where d is the gradient along e. this relation simplies the taylor series
expansion for e,

e = e + d + 1

2r(, e) + 1

6r(, d) + . . .

we will dene

(u, v) = z gij(0)uivj d2x

by parallel transport of the lagrangian density we can write the potential in the form

v = 1

2(e, e)

6

(33)

(34)

(35)

the potential therefore has a series expansion in  of the form v = v0 + v1 + v2 . . . where

v0 = 1
2(e, e)
v1 = (e, d)
v2 = 1
v3 = 2
v4 = 1

2(d, d) + 1
3(d, r(, e))
6(d, r(, d)) + 1

2(e, r(, e))

6 (r(, e), r(, e))

integration by parts in (37) produces the eld equation

de = e

i  i

k = 0

integration by parts on (38) produces the operator

f  = dd  r(, e)e,

(36)
(37)
(38)
(39)
(40)

(41)

(42)

which describes uctuations about the moduli space.
in the usual analysis of the sigma
model, the inverse of this propagator would be the green function in the background eld
approximation.

the normalised positive modes of the uctuation operator will be denoted by ui and
their eigenvalues by (i)2. the uctuation operator also has a set of zero modes ua = a0.
all of the modes are parameterised by the collective coordinates xa. we dene the remaining
coordinates in terms of the displacement vector,

 = xi ui

(43)

the potential then has a series expansion in the normal coordinates identical to equation
(13) used in the previous section. from equation (39),

where

vijk = 4c(ij)k

cijk = (dui, r(uj , e)uk).

(44)

(45)

the coecients are symmetrical, since c(ij)k = c(ijk). they are also trace-free if the zero
modes ua are included, c i

ij + c a

aj = 0.

the kinetic energy has a similar series expansion. since

t = 1

2(et, et),

(46)

we need only replace e by et and d by dt in equations (36-39). however, both the xi
and the xa depend on time, so that the time derivative of equation (43) implies

where the covariant derivative

dt = xi ui + xa xidaui

daui = aui + ua

ki

jkuj.

7

(47)

(48)

also, since ua = a0,

et = t0 = xaua.

(49)

equations (47) and (49) allow terms in the series expansion of the kinetic energy to be
grouped as a quadratic polynomial in the generalised velocities,

(57)

these results recover the normal coordinate expansion of the previous section (9)-(11), with
extra terms due to the curvature of the original conguration space. we now have explicit
expressions for the curvature and the extrinsic geometry of the space of soliton parameters
in terms of eigenstates of the uctuation operator.

the results of the previous section still apply, except for the addition of terms depending
on the target space curvature. a similar analysis to the previous section shows that two
extra terms

should be included in the potential u.

expressions involving derivatives of the eigenmodes can be rewritten using the identity

(59)

with the uctuation operator f given explicitly in equation (42), the commutator becomes

where equation (b7) has been used.

the dominant term in the reduced hamiltonian should be the zero point energy 1

2tr().
in general, in order to evaluate this term it will be necessary to solve the eigenvalue problem
for the uctuation operator numerically. once this has been done, equations (44), (61) and
(62) could then be used to evaluate the geometrical terms in the reduced hamiltonian (28).

iv. supersymmetric reduction

we now turn to the reduction of an n = 2 supersymmetric quantum system dened on
a riemannian symmetric space. as before, we supose that the system has a potential v
with a degenerate set of minima. the existence of two supersymmetries requires that the
space is a kahler manifold with a covariantly preserved complex structure j [15,16]. we
shall suppose that the moduli space of stable points is also a kahler manifold.

the variables consist of coordinates x and single complex component fermions . we
also assume the existence of an operator , related to the momentum, and the following
commutation relations

{, } = g



[, x] = i
[, ] = i
[, ] = ir



(63)
(64)
(65)
(66)

involving the inverse metric g, connection components 
r.

 and curvature components

it is possible to represent the commutator relations by covariant dierential operators

on a hilbert space with the basis

where |0i = 0. this gives a representation in which

(x)1...p1 . . . p|0i,

 = i(  )

(67)

(68)

the action of  is equivalent to i acting on the p-forms , where  is the metric
connection.

we shall assume that the classical system has two supersymmetries generated by the

supercharges

q(1) =   w(x)
q(2) = (j)  (j)w(x)

(69)
(70)

the reason for choosing this particular form for these supercharges will become apparent
when we come to discuss sigma models in the next section. we will only require the combi-
nation

q = 1

2(q(1) + iq(2)) =   w(x)

where the fermion elds

are purely holomorphic.

 = 1
 = 1

2(1 + ij)
2(1 + ij)

9

(71)

(72)
(73)

the hamiltonian is given (up to a constant) by h = {q, q}, which can be evaluated

using the commutation relations (66),

h =  1
 1

2 2 + gww  + iw ; + iw;
4 r[, ][, ]  1

4r[, ][, ]

(74)

the moduli space lies at the minimum of the bosonic potential and is parameterised by a
set of complex coordinates za. we asume that the superpotential w has a series expansion
in normal coordinates zi ,

w = w j z j + w j kz j z k + w jk lz j zkz l + . . .

(75)

the normal coordinates can be chosen to ensure that the boson mass matrix is diagonal,

gw j w k = (2) jk

(76)

for the fermion mass matrix w;, we need two seperate sets of basis vectors, in general, in
order to put it into diagonal form. we can always choose one basis (ea, ei) to coincide with
the coordinate basis at zi = 0 for the elds . another basis (ea, ei ) then has to be used
for the elds . (this proceedure is similar to the independent unitary rotations of the left
and right chirality fermions in the standard model). with the choice

ei  = 1

i w 

i e,

the fermion mass matrix becomes diagonal,

wi  j = i j.

(77)

(78)

the fermion elds a and a are massless and remain in the reduced quantum system. how-
ever, there is an important dierence between the nite and innite dimensional situations.
in the innite dimensional situation the basis ei  may be complete (in which case there are
no massless a fermions). we shall proceed assuming this to be the case.

previously, we used a series expansion for the hamiltonian to arrive at the reduced theory.
however, as shown in appendix c, for a supersymmetric theory we need only consider
the supercharge. the supercharge (71) depends on the normal coordinates through the
superpotential and through the connection coecients in . in the basis e = (ea, ei),

a  bcacb + k iab ia + ai ja j i + a i j aj 

 i 

in the limit zi = 0.

the rst few terms in the series expansion of the supercharge (71) are now

q0 = iii  i 
q1 = iada  i 
q2 = ir iz i(  ) + i 

wi  j z j
wi  j kz j z k

wi  j k lz j z k z l

(79)

(80)

(81)

(82)

where da now includes the connection terms (79).

10

the full quantum theory can now be reduced to the moduli space by following the meth-
ods described in appendix c. we dene the fermion vacuum state |0t i which is anihilated
by two sets of anihilation operators

i


= 12

(i + ii 

),

 i


= 12

( i + i i 

)

(83)

as in section 2, we build up from |0t i a set of oscillator states fn which satisfy h0fn = enfn,
where h0 is the unperturbed hamiltonian. in the supersymmetric case, e0 = 0.

the reduced hamiltonian is given in terms of the reduced supercharge by

hr = {qr, qr}

where

qr = hq1i00 + xn6=0

hq1i0n(e0  en)1hh1in0 + o(1)

the covariant derivatives are treated as in section 2, that is we write

hdai0n = 0nka + haai0n

(84)

(85)

(86)

in the supersymmetric case we include the fermion terms from equation (79),

haai0n = ka ij hz i zj i0n  k ibah ibi0n  ai jah j ii0n + ai  j ahi 

 j 

i0n

(87)

at leading order we recover the same result that we would obtain by a trivial truncation of
the theory,

qr = iaka + o(1)

(88)

as discussed in appendix a, the reduced states can be identied with antiholomorphic forms
on the moduli space and the the reduced hamiltonian can be identied with the laplacian.
at this order the reduced theory is identical with the truncated theory obtained under the
simplest assumptions [3].

v. supersymmetric sigma models

the supersymmetric sigma model in two space and one time dimension has lagrangian

l =

1

2 z (cid:16)gijij + igij idj(cid:17) d2x

(89)

where  = 0, 1, 2, and  is a two-component majorana spinor. if the target space is a kahler
manifold, with complex structure j, then the model has two supersymmetries. we shall
consider the reduction of this theory.

it is convenient to use a complex representation for the fermion elds, with

 = (cid:18) 

 (cid:19) ,

11

(90)

and a complex spatial coordinate z = x + iy. there are two complex supercharges in this
representation,

q(1) = z (cid:16)gijitj  2gijizj(cid:17) d2z
q(2) = z (cid:16)gij(j)itj  2gij(j)izj(cid:17) d2z

(91)

(92)

these can be used to generate the classical supersymmetry transformations by transforming
to phase space and using dirac brackets. the supercharges produce the hamiltonian by
dirac brackets

h = i

2 {q(1), q(1)}db = i

2 {q(2), q(2)}db

the combination q = (q(1) + iq(2))/2 can also be used, but in this case

where

i{q, q}db = h + et

et = 2z gij(jz)i(z)jd2z.

(93)

(94)

(95)

the integral is a constant for elds  in the same topological class. we can still use (94) to
generate the quantum hamiltonian.

the background eld expansion used in section 3 can be used again here to expand the
supercharge q. the bosonic uctuations about the background 0 are described by a vector
 and a uctuation operator f . the fermion elds are simply parallel propagated to 0
and decomposed into  =  + , where  and  are holomorphic, i.e. j = i.

since the complex structure j commutes with the uctuation operator, we can choose
holomorphic eigenmodes u and use these as a basis e. the supercharge for this theory is
given by

q = z (ii  2gijizj)d2z

(96)

when the eingenmode expansions are used, we recover the expression (71) used in section
4,

q =   w()

however, now we have an explicit formula for the superpotential

w = 2(u, exp()ez)

(97)

(98)

in terms of the product (34). the series expansion for w in the coordinate zi is obtained
using equation (33). the linear term is,

w j = 2(u, dzuj ).

(99)

where

12

dzui = zui

i + (zj

0)i

jkui

k

according to equation (76), this implies that the uctuation operator is

and also that the fermion mass matrix is diagonalised by choosing a basis

f ui = 4dzdzui

ei  = 2i1dzui.

(100)

(101)

(102)

these vectors actually form a complete basis, that is they form a normalisable set of eigen-
vectors of the (positive) operator dzdz. the only massless fermions are the a and these
remain as fermions on the moduli space. this is precisely the situation considered in the
previous section. the reduced theory is therefore identical to the truncated theory at leading
order.

vi. conclusion

the reduction of a classical dynamical system generally involves eliminating the internal
forces and introducing generalised coordinates. in quantum theory, the uncertainty principal
implies that the internal coordinates can never be frozen, but the reduction can be performed
approximately when the internal degrees of freedom remain close to their ground state.

we have considered the adiabatic reduction of various quantum systems onto a moduli
space of collective coordinates. the results for a quantum mechanical system are quite
general and depend on geometrical properties of the moduli space as well as the frequencies
of the internal modes. the reduced hamiltonian to leading order can be found at the end
of section 1.

the moduli space of sigma-model solitons has been quantised by taking the continuum
in the bosonic case, the terms in the reduced
limit of the quantum mechanical system.
hamiltonian operator depend on the eigenfunctions of a uctuation operator f . the
spectrum of the uctuation operator is continuous and the eigenvalue sums of the quantum
mechanical system have to be replaced by integrals and regularised.

we could have attempted to quantise the sigma-model moduli space with the instanton
techniques used in quantum eld theory. in this approach, based on a path integral, the
eld is replaced by collective coordinates xa and eld uctuations . the uctuations are
integrated out, leaving a path integral over the coordinates xa and a jacobian factor. the
classical action s gets replaced by

w [xa] = s[xa] + 1

2 log det(f  2

t ) + . . .

(103)

where the prime indicates omission of any zero eigenvalues and the dots denote contributions
from higher loop feynman diagrams. an adiabatic reduction can now be obtained by taking
the time derivatives to be small and evaluating some of the higher loop terms. in practice,
we have found this approach less practical and not as rigourous as the hamiltonian one
presented earlier.

the bosonic sigma model considered in section 3 can be generalised in various ways. an

important possibility would be to include potentials of the form

13

 = z w ()d2x.

(104)

the changes to the results brought about by introducing potentials are conned to the terms
in equation (28) involving vijk and vijkl, which depend on functional derivatives of .

the supersymetric sigma model is tightly constrained and reduces to the hodge laplacian
acting on antiholomorphic p-forms, conrming a result that has been used previously with
strong support but not derived rigourously [8,9,3]. it is here, especially, that higher order
terms in the adiabatic expansion might be of interest.

appendix a: factor ordering

when constructing a quantum theory the ordering of operators is an important issue.
a minimum requirement for choosing the operator ordering is to try to retain as much of
the symmetry of the classical system as possible. we shall consider symmetry under general
coordinate transformations, supersymmetry and the symmetry of a riemannian symmetric
space.

our rst example is classical particle mechanics in curved space, described by the hamil-

tonian

h = 1

2gpp.

(a1)

if we introduce a hilbert space of wave functions (x) and use the metric to construct an
inner product on the hilbert space, then the hamiltonian operator

h =  1

2|g|1/2|g|1/2g.

(a2)

is both covariant and consistent with the basic principals of quantum mechanics. however,
many other possibilities exist, since we are free to add terms such as

ir

[x, p]

(a3)

which are of order h or higher and vanish in the classical limit.
if we assume that the
hamiltonian operator is a covariant second order operator, then the form of this operator
must be [7]

h =  1

2 ( + a)2 + x

(a4)

however, the vector eld a and scalar eld x cannot be infered from the classical hamilto-
nian.

the quantum theory is far more restrictive if the space is a riemannian symmetric
space. a riemannian symmetric space is dened by its geodesic symmetries. the geodesic
symmetries about a point leave the point unchanged and map each of the geodesics through
the point into itself. a riemannian symmetric space has these symmetries at every point
and covariant derivatives of the curvature, which are odd under the reection symmetry,
must vanish [19].
in this case, both x and a, which are also odd under the geodesic
symmetry, must vanish. the hamiltonian on a riemannian symmetric space is therefore
given by the laplacian and a constant.

14

our second example is the supersymmetric particle mechanics on a kahler manifold,
originally discussed by witten [8]. the coordinates za and momenta a are supplimented
by a set of complex fermions a. the commutation relations are

b} = gab

{a, 
[a, zb] = ia
[a, b] = ib
[a, b] = irabdccd

cac

b

(a5)
(a6)
(a7)
(a8)

and their hermitian conjugates, where gab is the inverse metric, b
cac the connection com-
ponents and rabdc the riemannian curvature. the supersymmetry is generated by a super-
charge

q = aa.

(a9)

the ordering of the operators in the last commutation relation and the supercharge have so
far been chosen arbitrarily.

the commutation relations can be represented by dierential operators acting on the

hilbert space of functions (za, za, a), with

where

a = ia
a = i(a  cba

bc)

a = gab 
b

.

(a10)

(a11)

(a12)

in this representation all of the operators, including q, act covariantly on the functions .
the covariance is explicit if we regard  as an element of the exterior algebra over a basis
of forms a. in this case a = ia, where  is the covariant derivative, and q = i ,
where  is the antiholomorphic exterior derivative.

the hamiltonian is obtained from q by the relation h = {q, q}, which by the use of

equation (a9) and the commutation relations gives

h =  1

2 2 + 1

2 rabab

(a13)

where rab is the ricci tensor.

de alfaro et al. [9] have pointed out that alternative orderings of the two operators in
the supercharge (a9) would make the representation non-covariant. however, there do exist
alternative expressions for the supercharge which have the same classical limit,

q = aa  iawa(z) + aua(z)

(a14)

the condition q2 = 0 is satised if w = 0 and u = 0. the simplest way to satisfy these
conditions would be to make w a total derivative,

wa = ia(rb

c[xc, pb])

(a15)

which gives additional contributions to the hamiltonian of order h3. other contributions to
the hamitonian can exist if the manifold has non-trivial homology.

appendix b: geometrical formulae

this appendix reviews some formulae used to reduce the riemannian connection  onto
a submanifold m. we construct a basis of 1-forms (ni, ea), with dual basis (ni, ea), made
up to include the normal forms ni and vectors ea tangential to m. the metric is then

g = abea  eb + ij ni  nj

(b1)

where  is the metric on m. any vector x can be decomposed into a tangential and normal
parts,

xk = ea(x)ea
x = ni(x)ni

the extrinsic curvature ki and extrinsic torsion tensor ai

j are dened by

ab = (ani)b
ki
j
a = (anj )i
ai

(b2)
(b3)

(b4)
(b5)

the extrinsic curvature measures the expansion of the normal forms and it is always sym-
metric in the surface indices. the extrinsic torsion measures changes in the normals along
lines drawn in the surface. the extrinsic torsion is antisymmetric if the normals are of unit
length.

we will dene the tangential covariant derivative by its action on the basis vectors,

kxea = (xkea)k,

kxni = (xkni )

(b6)

with this denition the derivative is a metric connection for both  and , with torsion
j . we make repeated use of the following expression for the derivative of a
related to ai
normal directed tensor in the body of the text,

kaij = aij + ai

k

akj + aj

k

aik

(b7)

the curvature tensor of k will be denoted by kr.

the reduction of the curvature tensor is a standard proceedure, and has been described

in this notation in reference [17]. the most useful formula is gauss equation,

rabcd = krabcd  ij ki

ackj

bd + ij ki

adkj

bc

(b8)

in the case where m is a complex submanifold of a kahler manifold, the trace ki of the
extrinsic curvature tensor vanishes [18].

appendix c: adiabatic approximation schemes

this appendix shows how the hamiltonian operator and other operators can be reduced
by using almost degenerate perturbation theory [20]. the method is equivalent to the
adiabatic, or born-oppenheimer, approximation scheme for the energy eigenstates.

16

the hamiltonian is rst separated into an unperturbed part and a perturbation

h = h0 + h1.

(c1)

the eigenstates of h0 are then grouped into eigenspaces that cover a narrow range of
eigenvalues. a projection operator p0 projects onto the lowest of these eigenspaces and
p1 = 1  p0. the equation for the eigenstate with energy e is standard (see [20] for
example),

hr p0 = e p0

where

hr = e0 + p0h1p0 + p0h1p1(e  h0  h1)1p1h1p0

the leading order terms give

hr = e0 + p0h1p0 + p0h1p1(e0  h0)1p1h1p0 + . . .

(c2)

(c3)

(c4)

for an adiabatic approximation scheme, we look for an expansion of the wave function

in the form

(x) = xn

(xa)fn(xi, xa)

(c5)

where the wave function depends strongly on coordinates xi and weakly on coordinates
xa. we take an unperturbed hamiltonian h0 which commutes with the xa and dene the
functions fn by

h0 fn = en(xa) fn.

these can be normalised with respect to a reduced product

hf, gi = z f(xa, xi)g(xa, xi)d(xi).

with measure d(xi) chosen to make h0 self-adjoint.

the projection operator p0 is given by

p0 = 0(xa)

inserting complete sets of states into equation (c4) gives the equation for 0,

hr0 = e0

(c6)

(c7)

(c8)

(c9)

where the reduced hamiltonian operator has the perturbative expansion

hr = e0 + hh1i00 + xm

hh1i0m(e0  em)1hh1im0 + . . .

(c10)

the matrix elements

17

hh1imn = hfm, h1fni

(c11)

are operators of the reduced theory. they also act on the en.

other operators are reduced in a similar way. given an operator q, we follow (c3) and

dene

qr = p0qp0 + p0qp1(e  h)1p1hp0.

in the adiabatic approximation,

qr = hqi00 + xn

hqi0n(e0  en)1hh1in0 + . . .

is an operator that acts on the states 0.

the reduced operator satises

qrp0 = p0q

(c12)

(c13)

(c14)

where  is any energy eigenstate with eigenvalue e. this reduction is not generally a
homomorphism of the operator algebras, i.e. (qq)r 6= qrqr in general, but if q and q
are symmetries of the hamiltonian, then it follows from (c12) that

(qq)r = qrqr

in particular, if q is a supersymmetry operator with h = {q, q}, then

this simplies the problem of reducing the hamiltonian operator.

hr = {qr, qr}

(c15)

(c16)
