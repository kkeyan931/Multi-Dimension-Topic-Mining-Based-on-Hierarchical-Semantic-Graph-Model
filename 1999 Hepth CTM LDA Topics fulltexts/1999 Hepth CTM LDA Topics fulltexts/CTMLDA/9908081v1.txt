abstract

the chiral symmetry breaking in the 4-dimensional qed with the chirally
invariant four-fermion interaction is discussed by using a novel path integral ex-
pression in terms of the eld-strength tensor. in the local potential approxima-
tion, we nd that the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken for any nonzero
gauge and four-fermion couplings on the tree level of an auxiliary eld . the
present approach allows us to easily include higher orders of the gauge coupling
so that the eective potential up to the sixth order is obtained.

1 introduction

the standard model of elementary particles has had good agreement with experiments,
in which masses of quarks and leptons are generated by the yukawa interactions with
the higgs bosons. there, however, have been no experimental observations of the higgs
boson, and moreover, there is a theoretical problem of the naturalness. therefore
models without any elementary scalars have been considered[1, 2] as eective eld
theories to understand the origin of fermion masses: those are generated dynamically
through the interaction

(1.1)

which is suppressed by inverse powers of a high energy scale , at energies much below
it, that is, g22  o(1). it is called the nambujona-lasinio (njl) model[3] and has
been generalized to the one with the gauge interaction[4]:

although, in this model, nonperturbative approaches such as the schwingerdyson
equation with the ladder approximation[5, 6] or renormalization group[7] give a non-
trivial phase structure for chiral symmetry in a plane of gauge and four-fermi cou-
plings, they suer from gauge dependence. in the perturbative framework the inversion
method[8] does give a gauge-independent result[9], higher order calculations are tough
tasks.

if we employ the perturbative eective action approach to the problem of chiral
symmetry breaking(sb), there is some room for improvement or simplication of the
calculation from two viewpoints: (i) in view of the nonperturbative renormalization
group approach[7], the critical behavior is successfully described in the local potential
approximation: taking the lowest order of derivative expansion in the eective action.
we, therefore, expect that it could also be good in the perturbative calculation. (ii)
after integrating with respect to matter (fermionic) elds the result must be gauge
invariant, that is, be written as a functional of the eld-strength tensor f. therefore
it is preferable to rewrite the functional integral of the gauge potential a into that of
f. this could be a great help to the gauge-invariant calculation.

indeed in the lattice gauge theory, a change of variables from gauge potentials to
eld strengths has been given[10], whose recipe, however, is specialized to the lattice.
in the continuum theory, the eld-strength formulation has already been proposed[11].
it is, however, based on the special choice of gaugethe coordinate gauge xa = 0,
which cannot x the gauge at the origin and moreover yields complicated fermionic
currents with line integrals in the lagrangian.

in this article we give a perturbative and gauge-independent method for calculat-
ing the dynamical fermion mass under the local potential approximation.
inclusion
of higher orders of the gauge coupling constant is simpler in this method. we use
the functional integration not as a method simply reproducing perturbative diagrams
systematically, but as integration with nice features: changing variables and intro-
ducing auxiliary variables can easily be made. we rst construct a euclidean path
integral expression in terms of the gauge eld strength for the gauge sector with a
conserved source j: we start from the canonical formalism for quantization and nd
a suitable change of variables, which is the contents of sec. 2. second, in sec. 3 the
fermionic partition function, minimally coupled to the gauge potential, in the local
potential approximation is obtained by introducing auxiliary elds and by utilizing the
fock-schwinger proper-time method[12, 13]. at last combining the above two partition
functions and integrating with respect to the gauge eld strength to obtain an eective
potential of the dynamical fermion mass. the nal sec. 4 is devoted to a discussion.

2 functional integral in terms of the field strength

in this section we construct a euclidean path integral expression in 4-dimensional
abelian gauge theory coupled to a conserved current j, based on the canonical for-
malism[14],

in order to show the gauge independence manifestly we x the gauge in terms of

an arbitrary real function (x) satisfying[14, 15]

the gauge xing condition is[14]

(x) = 4(x);

which is satised by

z d4y (x  y)a(y) = 0,

a(x; ) = a(x)  

xz d4y (x  y)a(y),

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

for an arbitrary a(x). here we take a (x) whose support is 3-dimensional and
spacelike:

with

(x) = (0, f i(x)(x0)),

if i(x) = 3(x),

e(p) = (0,ef i(p))
pief i(p) = i.

if it were not for this restriction, a(x; ) in eq. (2.4) is nonlocal in time, so that we
cannot follow the canonical procedure. (here and hereafter repeated indices i, j, k,
etc., imply the summation over 1 to 3.) the relation (2.4) turns into

a0(x; ) = a0(x) + ef j(i) aj(x),

ef j(i)aj(x) z d3p

(2)3 eipxef j(p)eaj(p) =z d3y f j(x  y)aj(y)

and the time argument has been omitted. hereafter we use an abbreviation like
eq. (2.9) for simplicity; all the functions of i including 1/|| and 1/2 should
be understood in the momentum space representation.

the gauge-xed variable ai(x; ) must have two degrees of freedom out of three

ai(x)s, which can be singled out by considering the norm of the functional space

z d3x ai(x; )ai(x; ) =z d3x aj(x)m jk(i)ak(x),

3 sb in qed4 with the chirally invariant four-

fermion interaction

in this section, we consider fermionic system coupled minimally to the gauge po-
tentials (2.40) and (2.41) with the chirally invariant four-fermion interaction. the
partition function is

z[a] =z dd exp(cid:20)z d4xe(cid:26)(  ia) +

g2

2 (cid:2)()2 + (i5)2(cid:3)(cid:27)(cid:21) ,

(3.1)

where the gauge coupling constant has been absorbed into a. our scenario is as
follows:
introduce auxiliary elds to cancel the four-fermion interaction, and then
integrate with respect to the fermionic elds and nally the gauge eld strengths with
the aid of the representation in the previous section. the result is a tree potential of
the auxiliary eld, with which we examine the dynamical mass generation of fermions.
after introducing auxiliary elds  and , as usual, and integrating with respect to

 and , we have

z[a] =z dd exp(cid:20)z d4xe

2 + 2

2g2 + ln det(cid:2)(  ia) +  + i5(cid:3)(cid:21) .

(3.2)

shifting as   m +  and    and ignoring  and , we obtain the tree level
potential of (m):

z[a]0 = exp(cid:20)z d4xe

m2

2g2 + ln det(cid:2)(  ia) + m(cid:3)(cid:21) .

(3.3)

the exponent of eq. (3.3) must be a functional of the eld strength f  rather than
a as far as a regularization preserves the gauge invariance.

we here employ the local potential approximation: we adopt the lowest order of
derivative expansion, that is, discard any terms with dierentials like f e f, to ob-
tain a polynomial of f. this approximation seems to be valid, since we are interested
only in a low energy phenomena, the chiral symmetry breaking, where contributions
from large p should be much less important.

the functional form of the eective action under this approximation can be obtained

nonperturbatively by the fockschwingers proper time method[12, 13]:

z[a]0 = exp"z d

we need some regularization: in order to reproduce the njl result in the limit e  0,
we need an ultraviolet cuto  which is introduced by a modication of the range
of the  -integration to [1/2, ). however, this proper-time cuto breaks the gauge
invariance in the same way as the momentum-space cuto, contrary to the dimensional
regularization (d = 42). to overcome this diculty, we employ both regularizations
at the same time. we use the cuto for the zeroth order in the gauge coupling, since
it has nothing to do with gauge elds. while, for higher orders, the dimensional
regularization is used2. the result is

now we turn our attention to the functional integration of the gauge eld strength.

higher orders are those of eq. (3.8) with f  f  , and f  are given by eqs. (2.42)

integration variables from  and  to s, t , and u:

f f  = 2(s2 + t 2 + u 2),

(3.14)

yielding

f ef  = 2(s2  t 2),

dd[det||]2 = ds dt du det[ e ]1,

(3.15)

(3.16)

from eq. (2.44). as for f ef , though it cannot be expressed by the total divergence

any more, its expectation value in the space-time integral would vanish,

(3.17)

z d4xe hf ef i =z d4xe h2(s2  t 2)i = 0,

due to a symmetry s  t of the eective action (3.12); the dependence on s and t
appears only in the forms s2 + t 2 and (s2  t 2)2.

note that z[m] (3.12) is a trivial product of integrals at each space-time point. we
evaluate these integrals with the help of the wkb approximation. for a technical rea-
son we discard o(f 8) terms in eq. (3.8). (this enables us to obtain the stationary point
analytically. see below.) discretizing space-time with (lattice spacing)4 = 322/4

4 discussion

we give a gauge invariant recipe for calculating the eective action in qed with the
four-fermion interaction. we use perturbation and the local potential approximation
to study the dynamical fermion mass.
in order to include the higher orders of the
gauge coupling constant we just expand the completely known function (3.5) into a

15

+f 2

+ + f 2

[= ff/2] and f 2

polynomial of f 2
respect to the proper-time  . the last task is to evaluate the triple integral of s,
t, and u. in this article we employ the wkb approximation for it, which, however,
cannot be performed in an elementary manner when higher orders are included further.
meanwhile the ordinary perturbative treatment, considering the gaussian part the
kernel and expanding the exponential of higher parts than the third order, can always
be ensured.

[= (fef/4)2] and integrate with

as for the local potential approximation its ecacy is still open. in order to go
beyond the local potential approximation, we must perform the functional integration
of s, t , and u, instead of the ordinary integration like (3.18). for example, an o(())
quantity after integrating with respect to the gauge elds would be

i = z d
= z d
= z d

(4.3)

the local potential approximation is to expand (p2) in terms of p2 and keep the
lowest. since the change of variables, eq. (3.14), gives f(p)f(p) = s(p)s(p) +
t (p)t (p) + u(p)u(p), the leading correction to the local potential approximation
is

z ddx (0)(s e s  t e t  u e u).

(4.4)

therefore we must calculate the eective potential with the help of the feynman graphs
using the propagators of s, t , and u.

our result indicates that chiral symmetry is always broken for any () and g as
is seen from figs. 1 and 2. this seems to be dierent from previous results[5, 6, 7, 9]
which claim that there is a nonzero gc if () < /3. it is, however, too early to
conclude, since our present work is restricted only to the tree level of auxiliary elds
and thus no higher orders of g are included. as is seen from the figs. 1 and 2, the
small negative correction, linear in g, to dynamical mass could easily swallow the
broken region. from a recent study[17], the one-loop inclusion of the auxiliary elds is
promising. thus a further study must be necessary for a denite conclusion.

16

in qed the functional integral in terms of the eld strength can be constructed,
since the conguration space of the gauge potential as well as the eld strength is trivial
enough for the gauge to be completely xed. it is challenging to generalize eq. (2.33)
to qcd where an obstacle for gauge xing, the gribov ambiguity[18], exists. in order
to examine the dynamics of chiral symmetry breaking and color connement in qcd,
this must be done and the choice of convenient variables describing the low energy
phenomena[19] must be necessary.

these directions of study are in progress.
