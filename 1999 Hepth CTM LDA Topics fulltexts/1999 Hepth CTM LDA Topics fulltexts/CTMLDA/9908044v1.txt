abstract: the quantum mechanics of n slowly-moving charged bps black holes in
ve-dimensional n = 1 supergravity is considered. the moduli space metric of the n
black holes is derived and shown to admit 4 supersymmetries. a near-horizon limit
is found in which the dynamics of widely separated black holes decouples from that
of strongly-interacting, near-coincident black holes. this decoupling suggests that the
quantum states supported in the near-horizon moduli space can be interpreted as inter-
nal states of a single composite black hole carrying all of the charge. the near-horizon
theory is shown to have an enhanced d(2, 1; 0) superconformal symmetry. eigenstates
of the hamiltonian h of the near-horizon theory are ill-dened due to noncompact
regions of the moduli space corresponding to highly redshifted near-coincident black
holes. it is argued that one should consider, instead of h eigenstates, eigenstates of
2l0 = h + k, where k is the generator of special conformal transformations. the
result is a well-dened hilbert space with a discrete spectrum describing the n-black
hole dynamics.

1. introduction

one of the simplest examples of conformally-invariant quantum mechanics [1] is given
by the single-particle hamiltonian

h =

p2

g
2x2 .

this system has a generator of dilations

and special conformal transformations

.

(1.1)

(1.2)

(1.3)

these operators obey the sl(2, ir) conformal algebra

[d, h] = 2ih,

[d, k] = 2ik,

[h, k] = id.

(1.4)

of course since d and k do not commute with the hamiltonian, they are not symme-
tries of the theory in the usual sense. rather sl(2, ir) can be used to relate states of
dierent energies.

in fact the theory dened by h is hard to make sense of because there is no ground
state. the wave function wants to spread out to innite x. many years ago [1] de
alfaro, fubini and furlan (dff) suggested that one should consider, instead of h
eigenstates, eigenstates of

l0 =

2

(h + k) =

p2

g

.

(1.5)

l0 has a well behaved discrete spectrum of normalizable eigenstates.1

this same problem reappeared recently in a new guise [2, 3, 4, 5]. consider a
charged bps particle in a stationary trajectory a xed but small distance from the
horizon of an extremal reissner-nordstrom black hole. the near-horizon geometry
of extremal reissner-nordstrom is ads2  s2, so in this region the particle follows a
trajectory of constant r in the ads2 coordinates

ds2 = r2dt2 +

dr2
r2 .

(1.6)

non-relativistic radial motion of this particle is described by the hamiltonian h of
equation (1.1) with g = 0. g becomes nonzero when s2 angular momentum is added.
in this context the sl(2, ir) symmetry generated by h, d and k is nothing but the
sl(2, ir) isometries of ads2.

the absence of a good ground state for h in this context is the familiar statement
that there is a divergent continuum of very low-energy states corresponding to highly
redshifted trajectories very near the horizon at r  0. the origin of this problem is that
the time conjugate to h is not a good global time coordinate on ads2. on the other
hand l0 = 1
2(h + k) is conjugate to a good global time coordinate. so, as pointed out
in [2] and illustrated in gure 1, in the black hole context the dff suggestion simply
amounts to an improved choice of time coordinate.

in this paper we apply this philosophy to the problem of the quantum mechanics of
n slowly-moving ve-dimensional bps black holes, or equivalently quantum mechanics
on the n-black hole moduli space. this moduli space has two types of noncompact re-
gions into which the wave function spreads, preventing the existence of a normalizable
ground state. the rst such region is asymptotically at (r4n in ve dimensions) cor-
responding to widely separated black holes. we show that in a low-energy, near-horizon
limit, this non-compact region decouples from the near-horizon region of strongly inter-
acting black holes. the decoupling of this near-horizon region suggests that quantum
states supported in the near-horizon region can be interpreted as internal states of

a single composite black hole, and that the number of such states is related to the
black hole entropy. however the quantum hilbert space is again hard to make sense of
because of noncompact regions of the moduli space corresponding to near-coincident
black holes. the continuum of low-energy states again arise because of large redshifts
for near-coincident black holes. for the two-black hole case (n = 2) the problem is
equivalent to that of a bps particle near the black hole horizon, and the non-compact
region of the moduli space is exactly the troublesome r  0 region discussed above.

this non-compact region can be eliminated by a generalization of the dff sug-
gestion. we show that the near-horizon moduli space has an sl(2, ir) (more precisely
d(2, 1; 0)) symmetry. trading h for h + k, the special conformal generator k acts
as a potential on the moduli space which diverges in all the noncompact directions,
preventing the indenite spread of the quantum wave functions. we note that unlike
the 2-body case, trading h for h + k cannot (as far as we know) be viewed as a new
choice of time coordinate, and hence the n-body generalization is rather non-trivial.
nevertheless the result of the trade is a normalizable ground state and a well-dened
4n-body quantum mechanics.

it is worth emphasizing that no general argument that we know of guaranteed
the existence of an sl(2, ir) symmetry in the near-horizon limit. the existence of a
dilational symmetry at low energies follows simply from dimensional arguments. the

3

existence of a special conformal generator k however requires a very particular form
of the geometry.

the theory we specically consider is ve-dimensional n = 1 (8 supercharges)
supergravity with no vector multiplets. this can be obtained by compactication of
m-theory on a calabi-yau with b2 = 1. the black holes carry graviphoton charge.
they can be described as m2-branes wrapping the calabi-yau 2-cycle. other types of
black holesfor example those appearing in theories with more supercharges or vector
multipletshave a dierent structure typically with extra degrees of freedom. we do
not know if the sl(2, ir) symmetry exists in all cases.

the outline of this paper is as follows. in section 2 we give a detailed derivation
of the moduli space metric for n bps black holes in ve dimensions, completing pre-
vious work on the subject [6, 7, 8, 9] and in particular exhibiting the requisite four
supersymmetries. the problem of nding the supersymmetries in four dimensions re-
mains unsolved (although see [9]). in section 3 we nd the near-horizon limit of the
moduli space geometry. using results of [10], the d(2, 1; 0) conformal symmetry of
the near-horizon moduli space quantum mechanics is displayed in section 4. conclud-
ing comments on the possible role of this near-horizon quantum mechanics as a dual
description of black holes, the relation to m-theory constructions and the ads/cf t
correspondence [11], are in section 5.

2. derivation of the d = 5 multi-black hole moduli space

in this section we derive the moduli space of n bps black holes in ve-dimensional
n = 1 supergravity with a single u(1) charge, coupled to the graviphoton, and no
vector multiplets. neutral hypermultiplets, if present, do not aect the discussion
because they decouple. the relevant part of the action is [12]

where  = 1 (but we keep it general for most of the discussion) and we have normalized
the vector eld in an unconventional but convenient way.

and ~xa is the r4 coordinate of the ath black hole with charge qa.

supersymmetry2 implies a no-force condition between the black holes, and thus the
~xa are moduli for the set of states described by equations (2.2). the eective action
governing slowly-moving black holes is therefore described by the metric on this moduli
space; we will derive this metric following [13, 6, 7], and show that (for  = 1) it has
the properties expected for n = 4b supersymmetric quantum mechanics [9, 10].

the rst step in the derivation of the eective action, following [13] is to add the

(2.3)

to the action, where dsa is the line element of the center of the ath black hole. in
the remainder of this section we set lp = 1. the terms in equation (2.3) are necessary
because the equations of motion following from (2.1) are not satised at the timelike
singularities located behind the n black hole event horizons at ~x = ~xa. these source
terms will aect the calculation as we have set it up, because we work in a gauge in
which the zero modes corresponding to motion of the ath black hole do not vanish at
~x = ~xa. in principle it should be possible to choose a gauge in which the zero mode
vanishes at ~x = ~xa, and hence avoid adding the terms (2.3). however we have found
the integrals most tractable in the chosen gauge. in [13] the moduli space metric (in the
four-dimensional einstein-maxwell theory) was computed by rst smoothing out these
sources and then letting them approach delta functions at the end of the calculation.
we shall not nd this cumbersome procedure necessary.

but small velocities to linear order is

~xa is replaced with ~xa + ~vat. note that this is the most general galilean-invariant
ansatz to linear order.

note that ~p and ~r appear in the eective action (2.6) only as dp and dr, except
in the second and third terms. in order to apply equations (2.7), we need to do the
following manipulation on those terms:

and i r, r = 1, 2, 3 are the natural triplet of self-dual complex structures on r4. in [10] it
was shown that any action of the form (2.11) has (after appropriately adding fermions)
n = 4b supersymmetry (which has an su(2) r-symmetry under which the bosons
are complex doublets) for any function l. hence we conclude that the multi-black hole
moduli space has n = 4b supersymmetry.

we note that the rst term of equation (2.10) (i.e. the term with ijkl) has previ-
ously appeared in the literature [6, 7] on the ve-dimensional black hole moduli space,
but the last three terms (required by supersymmetry) were not previously included.

3. the near-horizon limit

in this section we describe the near-horizon limit of a collection of n black holes, in
which

with charges of order one. this corresponds to taking the characteristic distances
between the black holes to be much less than the planck length. it also corresponds to
kinetic energies much less than the planck mass, because the relative kinetic energy of
two black holes becomes highly redshifted when they are near one another.

an illustration of the resultant spatial geometry at a moment of xed time is given
in gure 2 for n = 3. before the limit is taken (gure 2a), the geometry has an
asymptotically at region at large |~x|. near the limit (gure 2b), as the origin is
approached along a spatial trajectory, a single throat approximating that of a charge
p qa black hole is encountered. this throat region is an ads2s3 geometry with radii
of orderpp qa. as one moves deeper inside the throat towards the horizon, the throat

branches into smaller throats, each of which has smaller charge and correspondingly
smaller radii. eventually there are n branches with charge qa. at the end of each
of these branches is an event horizon. when the limit is achieved (gure 2c), the

asymptotically at region moves o to innity. only the chargep qa trunk and the

many branches remain.

it is also of interest to consider the near-horizon limit of the moduli space geometry.

and  now given by (3.5). this is illustrated in gure 3 for the case of n = 2. near
the limit there is an asymptotically at r4n region corresponding to all n black holes
widely separated. this is connected to the near-horizon region where the black holes
are strongly-interacting, by tube-like regions which become longer and thinner as the
limit is approached. when the limit is achieved, the near-horizon region is severed from
the tubes and the asymptotically at region. the near-horizon metric (3.6) develops
four zero eigenvectors u ak = t k corresponding to the decoupling of the four overall
center of mass coordinates. for the case of two black holes the near-horizon region is
just at r4, with the tube touching at the origin.

4. conformal symmetry

the fact that the near-horizon moduli space geometry decouples from the rest of the
moduli space, suggests that the quantum states on this moduli space may be inter-

preted as internal states of a single charge p qa black hole. however an obstacle

10

is immediately encountered in attempting to make sense of the quantum mechanics:
the hamiltonian has no ground state because of the innite volume ascribed to near-
coincident black holes. indeed, near ~ua = ~ub the metric has a term

(q2

aqb + q2

|~ua  ~ub|4

dening ~wab =

~ua  ~ub
|~ua  ~ub|2

, (4.1) becomes

(q2

aqb + q2

bqa)|d ~wab|2.

.

(4.1)

(4.2)

this is just the at metric on r4, with innity corresponding to the near-coincident
limit (and the origin to innite separation). because of these innite-volume regions,
the quantum system has an innite number of states below any nite excitation energy,
and no normalizable ground state. this is in conict with the usual stringy picture of
a black hole as a system with a gap and a discrete spectrum.

in this section we will show that the near-horizon quantum mechanics has an
sl(2, ir) conformal symmetry (in fact a d(2, 1; 0) superconformal symmetry) with
generators of time translations h, dilations d and special conformal transformations
k. the hilbert space can then be sensibly dened as the eigenstates of h + k, rather
than of h itself.

to see this conformal symmetry we begin by dividing the potential l appearing
in the metric (3.6) up into pieces which represent the 1-body, 2-body and 3-body
interactions

with l = l1+l2+l3. it is a curious (and unexplained) fact that there are no 4-body or
higher interactions. l1 is a divergent ~ua-independent constant. this divergence does
not enter the metric which involves only derivatives of l. hence l1 can be ignored.

11

l2 has logarithmic divergences near ~u = ~ua. with a cuto  the divergences go like

(4.5)

(4.6)

first we look for a dilational symmetry of the 2-body and 3-body metrics g2 and

g3. it is easy to see that the vector eld

daiai = u aiai

(4.7)

generates a dilational symmetry under which the metric transforms as ldgab = 2gab.
although l2 (equation (4.4)) is not homogeneous because of the logarithm, the anoma-
lous piece does not contribute in the metric.

it was shown in [10] that in order to have a special conformal symmetry the one-

form

daidu ai

(4.8)

must be closed. the one-form is obtained from the vector eld by lowering the index
with the metric g = g2 + g3. a little algebra using equation (3.6) reveals that any
metric constructed from a potential obeying the weight 2 scaling relation (4.5) has
u ai as a zero eigenvector [10]. therefore

explicit computation then gives (suppressing factors of lp)

(4.11)

this geometry meets all the criteria described in [10] for the full d(2, 1; 0) superconfor-
mal symmetry. this group is the special case of the d(2, 1; ) superconformal groups
for which there is an su(1, 1|2) subgroup.

it is worth noting that while the existence of the dilational symmetry was more or
less guaranteed by the nature of the near-horizon limit, the same cannot be said for
the special conformal symmetry. indeed if the coecients of the four terms in (2.10)
are perturbed, the dilational symmetry remains but the special conformal symmetry
generically disappears.

5. discussion

we have given a manifestly supersymmetric presentation of quantum mechanics on the
ve-dimensional n-black hole moduli space. at low energies, the dynamics of near-
coincident black holes decouples from that of widely separated black holes, and an
enhanced sl(2, ir) symmetry appears. there are non-compact regions of this near-
horizon moduli space corresponding to coincident black holes. these regions are elimi-
nated by the potential k in the modied hamiltonian l0 = 1
2(h +k), which is singular
at the boundary of the noncompact regions. we then have an apparently well-dened,
albeit complicated, quantum mechanics describing black holes which are neither widely
separated nor coincident. a detailed description of the quantum states of this system
remains to be found. for now we content ourselves with a few comments on their
possible interpretation.

let us return to the case of m-theory on calabi-yau with b2 = 1. an alternate
picture of the charge n black hole is then an m2-brane holomorphically wrapped n
times around the kahler class. in the quantum theory one has a quantum mechanics
on the moduli space of n-wrapped holomorphic cycles. the black hole entropy should
be given by the logarithm of the number of ground states of the m2-brane, which is
roughly speaking the euler character of the moduli space. while ads2/cf t1 duality
[11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 4, 18, 19, 20] has eluded a proper understanding, this quantum
mechanics on the m2-brane moduli space should more or less be the theory which lives
on the boundary (boundaries?) of ads2.

this moduli space has several components. in one componentwhich we will refer
to as the higgs branch in an abuse of language (since there is no gauge theory on the

13

m2-brane)one has a single connected m2-brane mapped holomorphically into the
calabi-yau. there is one center of mass degree of freedom corresponding to transverse
motion on the spatial r4. the quantum states on the analog of this branch for 3-
branes on k 3  s1 and 5-branes on calabi-yaus1 were successfully related to black
hole entropy in [21] and [22].5 in addition there are coulomb branches corresponding
to disconnected membranes. these branches have up to n center-of-mass coordinates.
since we have only a single type of charge there is no way to lift these branches. the
importance of these branches for understanding ads2 black holes was discussed in [15].
navely what has been described in this paper has n center-of-mass coordinates and
is therefore the coulomb branch. in analogy with the calculations in [21, 22] one might
expect that the black hole entropy counts states on the higgs branch, and so should
not be captured by the coulomb branch considerations of this paper. however we
would like to suggest an alternate interpretation. the coulomb branch described herein
divides into the far-coulomb branch (containing widely separated black holes) and the
near-coulomb branch (containing near-coincident black holes). as we have seen, these
two regions decouple completely at low energies. a natural conjecture is that the near-
coulomb branch is in fact a dual description of the higgs branch, described above as the
quantum mechanics of a single n-wrapped membrane. a related phenomenon occurs
in the d1-d5 black hole, for which the near-coulomb branch is a dual description of
the small-instanton region of the higgs branchfor a recent discussion, see [23]. if this
is the case one does expect quantum mechanics in the geometry (3.6) to capture the
black hole entropy.

5note however that these computations of the entropy required only the dimension of the moduli
space, while membranes on a calabi-yau require the cohomology of the moduli space. this is much
more dicult to compute, and to date there is no microscopic computation of the entropy of these
black holes.
