abstract

we discuss the quantization of the green-schwarz string action on ads5 
s5. we demonstrate consistent, globally well-dened, gauge xing choices
for kappa symmetry and worldsheet dieomorphism invariance. we then
proceed to quantize the theory in a perturbation series in the inverse radius of
curvature, in a background eld expansion. we discuss vertex operators and
correlation functions, and demonstrate agreement with supergravity results
in the appropriate limit.

1 introduction

the ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3] relates string theory on an adsd+1 
sp space to a d- dimensional conformal eld theory. in particular, type iib
string theory on ads5  s5 is conjectured to be dual to n=4 su(n) yang-
mills theory in 3+1 dimensions. in view of this conjecture, it is important to
understand the formulation of string theory on these spaces. such a formula-
tion would provide a nonperturbative solution of supersymmetric yang-mills
theory.

however, formulating string theory on these backgrounds is not a straight-
forward exercise. the basic reason for this is that these backgrounds typically
involve a ramond-ramond eld strength, and such backgrounds are dicult
to describe in the usual rns formulation of perturbative string theory. an
exception is the case of ads3 s3, where there exists a solution with a back-
ground ns-ns eld strength. this background has been treated in the rns
formulation in [4, 5].

another approach to string quantization in adsd+1  sp backgrounds is
the green-schwarz (gs) formalism [6]. indeed, actions which represent the
classical gs string in these backgrounds have been found. these actions
can be written for both the ads5  s5 background [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and the
ads3  s3 background [12, 13, 14]. the reason that the gs approach may
be appropriate is that spacetime supersymmetry is manifest, and so there is
no fundamental dierence between ns-ns and r-r backgrounds.

these actions are, however, only classical, and need to be quantized.
in particular, there are various gauge symmetries, of reparametrization and
kappa-symmetry, that need to be xed.
in the case of the at space gs
action, this is most eectively done in light-cone gauge [6]. however, the
backgrounds under consideration have no globally dened light-like direction,
and therefore this gauge is invalid. much of our discussion therefore, revolves
about choosing a gauge-xing. this is described in section 3.

after the gauge xing, the action does not simplify very much; it is still a
complicated sigma-model with several interaction terms. it can nevertheless
be treated in sigma-model perturbation theory, since (as we show) there is a
well dened expansion in powers of the curvature of the background. this is
related by the ads/cft correspondence to a perturbation series in 1
g2n in
the dual yang-mills theory.

we present leading order expressions for vertex operators in the theory.
these expressions provide a starting point for constructing the vertex op-

1

erators in powers of the curvature. similarly, correlation functions can be
computed in a perturbation expansion. we show that the leading order cor-
relation functions reduce to previously computed results. in particular we
recover the supergravity procedure of calculating the cft correlation func-
tions [2, 3].

one should note that we do not prove that the sigma-model we consider
denes a spacetime conformal eld theory. there have been arguments that
this is the case [15, 7], but a direct proof is still lacking. the consistency of
our results is, however, an encouraging sign.

2 the green-schwarz string action

we review here the green-schwarz string action constructed in [7]. we con-
centrate on the case of type iib string theory on ads5s5, but the discussion
can also be applied to similar string backgrounds, such as the green-schwarz
string on ads3  s3, discussed in [12, 13, 14].

we shall use the metric of ads space in the form

ds2 = (1 + e2r2)dt2 +

dr2

1 + e2r2 + r2d2

(1)

where e2 is the cosmological constant in string units, related to gauge theory
parameters as 1

the action is constructed as a -model action with the target space being
so(4,1)so(5). the action is written in terms of the supervielbeins

where m3 is the string worldsheet.

the supervielbeins, viewed as 1-forms over the coset manifold, are re-
stricted to satisfy the maurer-cartan equations, given explicitly in [7]. the
solution of these equations was found in [7]. the expressions for the super-
vielbeins la, li are given as :

li = "  sinh m

and

la = ea

where m2 is given by

our notation is that of [7]; a = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 are tangent space indices for
ads5 and a = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 the corresponding indices for s5. the index a
runs over 0, 1..9, and ea, ab are the bosonic vielbein and the spin connection
respectively.

we work in a euclidean worldsheet, and x the worldsheet metric to be
gij = ij. in this gauge, the equations of motion for the sigma model are [7]

(10)

in this paper we are interested in quantizing the action in leading order
in the cosmological constant e2. the supervielbeins reduce in the leading
order to:

la = ea + ii adi
li = di

(11)

these expressions are the covariant extensions of the corresponding ex-
pressions of the at space green-schwarz string. in particular, the interaction

3

with the background curvature, and the interaction with the rr background,
are both included in the leading order action.

this leading order action, to be discussed in the rest of the paper, is given

in [7]. it is the covariantization of the usual at space gs action:

1
2

(ei

l1 = 

a  ii adii)2  iijei

asij i adjj + ij(1 adi1)(2 adi2).
(12)
we wish to quantize this action in a background eld expansion. the
background we choose is a worldsheet at a constant spatial position. the
gauge we wish to work in is the covariantization of the at space x0 = 
gauge. in order to perform this quantization we need to dene our gauge
choices globally, before going to any limit of interest. we turn, then, to
discuss the gauge xing of the action.

3 gauge fixing

in order to quantize the action we rst need to gauge-x the worldsheet gauge
symmetries : reparametrization invariance and kappa-symmetry.

we rst change the fermionic basis to the killing spinor basis1 [9].

these, by denition, satisfy

( )i = e
(d )i = e

()i
(d)i

(13)
(14)

these equations permit solutions because of the highly symmetric nature of
the space ads5  s5, which has 32 killing spinors. we note also that the
covariant derivative used in this denition includes an interaction with the
rr background, in addition to the usual coupling to the spin connection.

in this basis, the equations of motion for the spinors simplify

(ijij  ijsij )ji = 0

(15)

we can now x the kappa symmetry. denote + = 0 + r, and choose :

1this is a somewhat misleading term, as i are generally not killing spinors. however,

we stick to the established notations.

+i = 0

(16)

4

this gauge is globally well-dened, unlike the gauge choices of [9, 10]. the
reason for imposing this gauge on the killing spinor basis rather than the
original basis is that the original fermions pick up a phase factor if the string
is transported around a path with nontrivial holonomy. the spinors i, on
the other hand, do not pick up such a factor. this can be seen from the fact
that their kinetic term does not contain a coupling to the spin connection or
to the rr background. hence this gauge choice is globally well dened.

we now turn to x the worldsheet dieomerphism invariance. we al-
ready chose the conformal gauge: gij = ij. the conformal gauge leaves
an unbroken subgroup of the worldsheet gauge symmetries, the conformal
transformations. a consistent way to x those residual gauge symmetries is
described in [6]. one may choose any free eld on the worldsheet and set it
to equal one of the worldsheet coordinates, say  . this consistently forces
(almost) all the fourier modes of the gauge parameter to vanish, leaving 
rigid translations, generated by l0  l0, as the only leftover gauge freedom.
this gauge choice is utilized in the at space string action to x the lightcone
gauge, as discussed in [6].

similarly, one may utilize an exactly conserved current on the worldsheet
to x the conformal transformation. being exactly conserved determines the
conformal transformation law of the current. therefore, xing ji to be a
constant forces almost all of the fourier modes of the gauge parameter to
vanish. the leftover gauge invariance in this case consists of rigid translations
on the worldsheet, generated by both l0 and l0.

we wish to choose a gauge which reduces to the temporal gauge x0 = 
asymptotically in spacetime (where  is a constant). as a timelike coordinate
can be dened globally, unlike a null coordinate, this gauge choice can be
made globally well-dened. moreover, the momentum conjugate to the global
time denes the dimension operator in the spacetime cft. therefore the
constant  has a natural interpretation in that cft.

the reader may be aware of the notorious problems of string quantization
in the temporal gauge, in the at space case. the interpretation of the
quantization procedure in the case of the ads space is, however, radically
dierent. for example, by constructing vertex operators of the rst quantized
string one constructs operators in the spacetime cft. those operators are
not required to have a particle interpretation, and indeed lie generally in
non-unitary representations of the spacetime symmetry group. furthermore,
the dual gauge theory is believed to be consistent when treated in the global

5

time, having a hamiltonian and unitary time evolution2.

to work in the temporal gauge it is natural to utilize the time translation

current on the worldsheet:

ji

0 = e0

0(x0)(e0

i + ii 0dii)

(17)

in order to simplify the action it is convenient to add to this current
another conserved current which has no action on the zero modes of the
elds. it therefore corresponds to a uniform shift of the dimension of each
multiplet separately. the shift can be shown to vanish for the supergravity
vertex operators constructed below3.

the conserved current we use to x the gauge is then:

ji = ji

0  i(i)ii

(18)

the extra current is exactly conserved as a consequence of the equation of
motion (15). with this gauge xing taken the fermions have a non-degenerate
kinetic term.

thus, in order to specify the temporal gauge we choose:

ji = i

(19)

the constant  is to be interpreted as the total dimension, similar to
the total light cone momentum p + in lightcone quantization. this can be
demonstrated for supergravity states as follows.

dene the worldsheet current corresponding to x  translation as j 
i .
assuming the spacetime superconformal algebra is an exact symmetry of
the quantum theory, one can work in states that are representations of the
superconformal algebra. therefore

(z d j 

 )| state >= r| state >

(20)

where r is a generator in some matrix representation of the spacetime
superconformal algebra.
we take now the mini-superspace approximation, setting all  derivatives
to zero. this is the particle limit of the string theory, and the states in this

2we thank tom banks for discussions on this point.
3the shift is given by a certain number operator for fermionic oscillators.

6

approximation are those of the rst quantized supergravity. the worldsheet
current satises:

in addition one has the virasoro constraint:

 j 

 = 0

t00 = gj 

 j 

 = 0

(21)

(22)

this constraint sets the second casimir of the superconformal algebra, in
the r representation, to zero. this is exactly the equation satised by the
supergravity modes, which determines the dimension of any mode in terms
of its other quantum numbers.

in the gauge chosen this equation relates the constant  to the quantum
numbers of the state in exactly the same way (up to a trivial shift). this
result is independent of the approximation we take next, the background
eld expansion.

with the same assumption, namely that the quantum theory preserves
the spacetime superconformal algebra, one can organize the string states into
supersymmetry multiplets. we note that as a consequence of the supercon-
formal algebra, members of any given multiplet carry dierent dimensions.
specically, this follows from the commutation relations:

[q, d] =

q
2

(23)

where q are the supersymmetry generators, and d is the dimension.

formally, therefore, dierent states in the same supersymmetry multiplet
belong to separate hilbert spaces. in the leading order approximation around
at space, however, the splitting is zero, and multiplets are degenerate. a
proof of closure of the spacetime symmetry algebra to the rst subleading
order would therefore establish the required splitting.

4 background field expansion

having dened our gauge choices globally, we are ready to use the resulting
action. we proceed by expanding the action in a background eld expansion
around the following worldsheet conguration:

7

dene x  = x 

coordinate index.
dene:

0 +, where x 
0 are constants, and  = 0, ..., 9 is a curved
in order to normalize the uctuating elds canonically

(x 
where a = 0, ..., 9 is a tangent space index.

a = ea

0 )

(24)

we expand the action (12) in powers of a, the bosonic uctuations. since
r determines the magnitude of spacetime derivatives, this is an expansion in
/r. thus, this approximation is useful in studying small uctuations of
a worldsheet located asymptotically in spacetime, near the boundary of the
ads space. in particular it is suited for the study of non-normalizable modes,
which correspond to the operator algebra of the spacetime cft.

the action and the gauge choice simplify signicantly in the leading order
in the background eld expansion, becoming essentially the at space gs
action in the x 0 =  gauge. however, the treatment of the zero modes,
bosonic and fermionic, is sensitive to the curved nature of the space.

the action (12) is constructed from the following ingredients, written to
rst subleading order in e, the cosmological constant. we use the indices
m, n, ... = 1, ..., 8 to denote the transverse uctuations. the kappa sym-
metry gauge choice is imposed, but we delay imposing the dieomeorphism
gauge choice till later.

(28)

the gauge xing is

ji = e0

0(x0)(e0

i + ii0dii)  i(i)ii

(29)

in the limit taken, this expression reduces to:

8

ji = e0

0(x0)i0

(30)

though the gauge choice has to be imposed exactly, approximating ji by its
leading order changes the action only in subleading terms in the background
eld expansion. to nd the complete action to rst subleading order one
needs to include the next order action written in [7], use the expansion (25),
and expand the gauge choice as well.

thus we impose in the leading order:

e0
0(x0)i0 = i

(31)

in this limit the action for the uctuations simplies. the transverse
uctuations and the fermions obey free eld equations, and can be expanded
in modes. the zero mode structure is still sensitive to the global structure
of the background. we demonstrate this by constructing some simple vertex
operators in the next section.

5 vertex operators

in order to nd the vertex operators one needs to solve the virasoro con-
straints. apart from the zero-mode contribution, this is identical to solving
the constraints in at space, in the x 0 =  gauge.

we use the following notation: we work in worldsheet lightcone coordi-
nates  =    . we concentrate on the left-moving part, and suppress the
corresponding indices. in spacetime we use the indices a, b, .. to denote all
coordinate labels except for 0, the gauge xed coordinate.

the fermion 1 is left-moving by its equation of motion, and we denote

it by s.

the left moving virasoro constraint is found to be:

t = (m)2  (



0(x0)  i s0s)2 + (r + i s0s)2
e0

(32)

the bosonic uctuations have the mode expansion:

a = ea

(x0)()0 + xn6=0

1
n

a

n exp(in+) + right movers

(33)

9

the normalizations chosen in this mode expansion need to be claried.
the fundamental variables to be quantized are the unrescaled uctuations
 dened above. for oscillator modes the rescaling in equation (24) has the
mere eect of changing their normalization. however, the zero mode of r
does not commute with ea
(x0), hence we choose to keep the original zero
modes ()0 , and their conjugate momenta p , as our canonical variables.

one imposes the following commutaiton relations:

[()0, p ] = g(x0)
ha
mi = imm+n,0
n, b

for the fermions one has the mode expansion:

s = s0 + xn6=0

sn exp(in+)

and the anti-commutation relations are:

(34)

(35)

(36)

n(sm), sno = i0m+n,0

dene ln to be the fourier modes of t . the gauge xing chosen here xes
almost all the conformal transformations, leaving unxed the rigid transla-
tions generated by l0 (and l0). thus one needs to solve the constraints for
all ln, n 6= 0. these can be used to express all the modes {r
n} in terms of
the transverse uctuations m.
in the absence of fermionic oscillators these equations simplify, and are

given as:

ln = xk

a
nk b

k = 0

(37)

these are quadratic equations for the modes {r

n}, unlike the linear equa-
tion in the lightcone gauge quantization of the at space string. the equation
can be formally solved as:

r

k = z d exp(ik)q2g00  (m)2

(38)

the vertex operators represent emission vertices in at space, and their
interpretation in our case is demonstrated by computing their correlation
function in the next section. as the vertex operators carry non-zero dimen-
sions, they cannot be interpreted as acting on the hilbert space of states with

10

a xed total dimension , denoted as h. they should be formulated as
operators acting in a larger hilbert space, where the dimension  is allowed
to change.

to formally express this fact we introduce the operators o = exp(x 0

0 ).
here x 0
0 is the zero mode of the time coordinate x 0, unxed by our gauge
choice. these operators act naturally in an enlarged hilbert space h dened
as the direct sum of all the hilbert spaces h of xed .
it is convenient also to introduce an operator , which is proportional to
the unit operator in any summand hilbert space h , and takes the value 
there. then one has the following commutation relation:

h , oi = o

(39)

the vertex operators are functionals of the transverse uctuations and
their conjugate momenta, as well as r0, the radial zero mode, and its con-
jugate momentum. they include an appropriate operator o dened above.
as a result of the leftover gauge freedom, the vertex operators are restricted
to satisfy the l0 constraint:

[l0, v ] = v

l0 = g(x0)pp + g00(x0) 2 +xk

a
ka

k

(40)

where in this equation the oscillators r
equation (37).

n are given in (38), as solutions to

as usual one needs to choose operator ordering when writing the expres-
sion for l0, since the momenta pr do not commute with the zero mode r0.
note that in this order there is no normal ordering constant in this expression,
as we have exact cancellation between free bosonic and fermionic uctuating
modes.

the simplest vertex operators are the supergravity modes. their oscilla-
tor part is identical to the at space case, and their zero mode wavefunction
is determined by the l0 constraint. this simply sets the spacetime covariant
laplacian, which is the second casimir of the conformal algebra, equal to
the ten dimensional mass of the string state, zero in this case.

for example consider the vertex operator of a graviton with transverse
polarization. we also set the transverse momenta to zero, as all other cases
can be simply obtained from this one. the corresponding vertex operator is
then:

11

v mn = x m x n o mn(r0)

(41)

the l0 constraint translates then to the following equation on the wave

function mn(r0):

g002mn + r (grrrmn) = 0

(42)

which is identical to the equation satised by the corresponding supergravity
mode. in order to make correlation functions non-vanishing, one is forced to
take the non-normalizable solutions of this equation, as is discussed in the
next section.

6 correlation functions

the ads/cf t correspondence includes a prescription for calculating cor-
relation functions of cft operators in the supergravity limit of the ads
theory[2, 3]. dene the generating functional of the cf t correlation func-
tions as w [0]. the currents 0 couple to cf t operators, and dierentiation
of w [0] with respect to those currents yields the correlation functions of
those operators.

the ads/cf t correspondence identies this generating functional with
in

the spacetime partition function with prescribed boundary conditions.
the supergravity limit this is simply:

w [0] = exp(s[, g])

(43)

the currents 0 enter the supergravity calculation as boundary conditions
for the supergravity elds, or equivalently as deformations of these elds by
non-uctuating, non-normalizable modes[16].

we wish to recover this prescription in the present context.
theory one computes correlation functions of vertex operators as:

in string

dy vie = z dxd exp(s)y vi

(44)

these correlation functions are obtained by dierentiation of the following

generating functional:

w [j] = z dxd exp(s +xi

jivi)

(45)

12

the expression is readily recognized as the partition function of the string

with the string action deformed by the addition of pi jivi. for the gravity

modes, this can be interpreted as deformation of the spacetime metric (and
its supersymmetric partners). take for example the graviton vertex operator
constructed in the last section, equation (41). adding it to the string action
results in deforming the spacetime metric by omn(r0).

therefore we are motivated to identify the string vertex operators with
the non-normalizable modes of spacetime elds, and the string generating
functional (45) with the cft generating functional as in (43).

thus, a natural extension of the supergravity prescription in (43) is to
identify the generating functional of the cft correlation functions with the
string partition function, with the string action deformed by the correspond-
ing (1,1) operators.

this leads to the following identication [17]:

here vi is the string vertex operator representing the non-normalizable

dy oie = dy vie

(46)

mode which couples to the cft operator oi.

for the supergravity modes, in the mini-superspace approximation, this
can be shown to reduce to a supergravity calculation. in this limit the cor-
relation of vertex operators is reduced to

dy vie = z dxds0 exp(z d l0)y vi

where the string action is (in the minisuperspace approximation)

l0 = g x  x 

(47)

(48)

we demonstrate the calculation of correlation functions by calculating
the two point function of the graviton vertex operator above, equation (41),
which has no angular momentum on either the s3 or the s5. the vertex
operator is then:

vmn = x m x nmn(x)

(49)

where mn(x, x) is the bulk-to-boundary propagator [2], corresponding to
an operator insertion at point x on the boundary.

13

the integral (47) is then

z dxds0 exp(cid:18)z d l0(cid:19) x m x nmn(x, x) x m x nmn(x, y)

(50)

we can exponentiate the vertex operators to

i[j] = z dxds0 exp(cid:18)z d l0 + j(x) x m x nmn(x, x)(cid:19)

(51)

we can then generate the correlation functions by dierentiating with respect
to j(x).

if j(x) was zero, then the integral equals (see for example [18])

w [0] = z dxds0 exp(cid:18)z d l0(cid:19)

= z dxdp exp(p x) exp(gpp)

which by standard path integral manipulations is

w [0] = xn

exp(p2

nt )

where pn are the eigenvalues of

i[gijj] = p2

n

(52)

(53)

(54)

we can therefore replace the sum over modes by an integral over eld con-
gurations

w [0] = z d exp (g)

(55)

we can redo this calculation in the presence of vertex operators. it is

straightforward to show that [18]

z dxds0 exp(cid:18)z d l0 + j(x) x m x nmn(x, x)(cid:19)
= z d exp(g  jg)

(56)

to calculate a two point function, we dierentiate with respect to j twice.

14

at this point, it is clear that we have reduced the computation to the
corresponding supergravity calculation, and thus shown the equivalence of
the formulae (43) and (45), in the appropriate limit.

in order to compare to the supergravity result we still have to discuss the

normalization of the vertex operators.

in order to normalize correctly the vertex operator (41), one needs to con-
sider their cft interpretation. usually a vertex operator insertion carries
a factor of gstr, the string coupling. this gives, for example, a gstr indepen-
dent result for the two point functions calculated on the sphere , as sphere
amplitudes are proportional to
2 . the three point function on the sphere
is then proportional to gstr.

1
gstr

in the present context, correlation functions of the graviton are inter-
preted as correlation functions of the energy-momentum tensor of the space-
time cft. as such, they obey conformal ward identities which are gstr in-
dependent. for example, one such identity relates the two-point and 3-point
functions as follows:

dt 

(x)t (y)t (z)e = (x  y)y ht (y)t (z)i  (x  z)z  ht (y)t (z)i

(57)
thus, the graviton vertex operator cannot carry any factor of gstr. con-
sequently, all correlation functions on the sphere are proportional to
2 .
additional factors of e2 may arise from the worldsheet calculation, hence
b2.
the general correlation function on the sphere is proportional to n bgstr
the constant b is determined by dimensional analysis, 4b being the total
conformal dimension of the correlation function.

1
gstr

the two-point function above is then found to be:

hvmnvmni = n 2

1

|x  y|4

(58)

this result agrees with the calculation of the central charge of the gauge

theory [3].
