(talk presented 32nd ahrenshoop international symposium elementary particle theory buckow, germany) 1 problems conventional approach construction eld theory action superstring im- portant problem since may lead information non-perturbative superstring theory unobtainable on-shell perturbative s-matrix. information might useful understanding non- perturbative dualities superstring. although much activ- ity ten years ago concerning eld theory action bosonic string, much progress constructing eld theory action superstring. reasons described below, obvious generaliza- tion bosonic string eld theory action superstring. since non-perturbative dualities superstring expected analog bosonic string, surprising much learned dualities studying bosonic string eld theory. covariant string eld theory action bosonic string based brst operator q string eld a. wittens approach open string eld theory, gauge-invariant action  sopen = z  (1) 1 string elds glued together midpoint. gluing pre- scription preserves length open string, one x open string length approach. wittens gluing procedure gener- alized closed strings requiring two closed strings interact half one closed string overlaps half closed string, length resulting closed string length initial closed string. using gluing procedure, gauge invariance implies eld theory action non-polynomial a, i.e.  sclosed = z  (2) ... includes contributions orders a. factor (c0 c0) necessary kinetic term ghost-number counting since carries ghost-number 2 closed string ghost-number anomaly +6. (c0 c0) factor, closed string action gauge invariant = (q+ q) satisfy constraints (b0 b0)a = (b0 b0) = 0. another covariant approach bosonic string eld theory open strings glued endpoints closed strings glued one point . approach similar light-cone string eld theory length string momentum light- cone direction. covariantized light-cone approach, length string becomes free parameter conserved interactions, i.e. length nal string equal sum lengths two initial strings. although free parameter gauged away on-shell, unclear treat innities caused integration parameter functional integral. nevertheless, interesting note using gluing prescription, possible construct gauge-invariant cubic closed string eld theory action form sclosed = z . (3) before, (b0 b0)a = 0 required gauge invariance. one also construct gauge-invariant open string eld theory action using end- point gluing prescription, however, unlike action (1) (but like light-cone open string action), cubic. generalizing approaches superstring eld theory, main diculty comes requirement string eld carries denite picture. recall physical state superstring represented 2 innite number brst-invariant vertex operators covariant rns formalism . remove innite degeneracy, one needs re- quire vertex operator carries denite picture, identifying modes (, ) ghosts annihilate vertex operator. open superstring elds, common choice neveu-schwarz string elds carry picture 1 ramond string elds carry picture 1 2. closed superstring elds, one analogous choice (left,right) picture corresponding choice neveu-schwarz ramond (left,right) sectors. since total picture must equal 2 open superstrings, obvious generalization action (1)  = z  (4) z = {q, } picture-raising operator picture +1 = ce2 picture-lowering operator picture 1. however, shown wendt , action (4) gauge-invariant contact- term divergences occuring two zs collide. although one choose pictures string eld change relative factors z , choice action cubic gauge- invariant  {$9108021$}. one way make action gauge-invariant would introduce innite number contact terms cancel divergences coming colliding zs. however, coecients contact terms would innite classical action since divergences present already tree-level amplitudes. note innite number divergent contact terms also expected light-cone superstring eld theory (either rns green-schwarz formalisms) cancel divergences interaction points collide . closed superstring, total left right-moving pictures must equal 2, generalization actions (2) (3) {$9202087$} sclosed = z . since (5) contains zs interactions, action naively suers contact-term divergences action (4). however, using closed-string gluing prescription (2), interaction points never collide 3 problem. contact-term divergences problem using covariantized light-cone gluing prescription (3) allows colliding interaction points (as light-cone string eld theory). problem (5) exists using either gluing prescription picture-lowering operators commute (b0b0). implies ramond contribution action gauge-invariant = (q + q) even quadratic level. problem ramond sector surprising since type iib ramond-ramond sector contains massless chiral four-form state extremely dicult construct kinetic action. 2 new approach open superstring proceedings, new approach superstring eld theory proposed uses two brst-like operators instead one. approach based fact critical n=1 superconformal eld theory (such ten-dimensional superstring) described critical n=2 superconformal eld theory. n=1 n=2 embedding described reference  shown physical n=1 vertex operator represented physical n=2 vertex operator, scattering amplitudes coincide using either n=1 n=2 prescriptions computation. furthermore, shown reference  that, twisting, n=2 physical vertex operators scattering amplitudes computed without introducing n=2 ghosts. ghost-free prescription called n=4 topological prescrip- tion since uses (small) n=4 superconformal generators constructed set critical n=2 superconformal generators. four fermionic n=4 generators labeled (g+, g, g+, g) g+ g original fermionic n=2 generators, g+ = , g = , (er j , j, er j ) su(2) generators constructed original u(1) generator j. twisting, (g+, g+) carry confor- mal weight +1 (g, g) carry conformal weight +2. three critical n=2 superconformal eld theories relevant here. rst self-dual string describes self-dual yang-mills (open) self-dual gravity (closed) = (2, 2) . left-moving worldsheet elds self-dual string consist (xa, a) = 1 2. self-dual string, left-moving n=4 fermionic 4 generators g+ = xa+a, g+ = x+a+a, g = x+aa, g = xaa.
