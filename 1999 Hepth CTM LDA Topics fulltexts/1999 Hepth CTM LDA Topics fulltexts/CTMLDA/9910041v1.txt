abstract

black hole generalized p -brane solutions for a wide class of intersection rules
are obtained. the solutions are dened on a manifold that contains a product of
n  1 ricci-at internal spaces. they are dened up to a set of functions hs
obeying a non-linear dierential equations (equivalent to toda-type equations) with
certain boundary conditions. a conjecture on polynomial structure of governing
functions hs for intersections related to semisimple lie algebras is suggested. this
conjecture is proved for lie algebras: am , cm+1 , m  1 . explicit formulas for
a2 -solution are obtained. two examples of a2 -dyon solutions (e.g. dyon in d = 11
supergravity and kaluza-klein dyon) are considered. post-newtonian parameters
 and  corresponding to 4 -dimensional section of the metric are calculated. it
is shown that  does not depend upon intersections of p -branes. extremal black
hole congurations are also considered.

1 introduction

at present there exists an interest to the so-called m -theory (see, for example, [1]-[2]).
this theory is supermembrane analogue of superstring models [3] in d = 11 . the
low-energy limit of m -theory after a dimensional reduction leads to models governed by
a lagrangian containing a metric, elds of forms and scalar elds. these models contain
a large variety of the so-called p -brane solutions (see [4]-[49] and references therein).

in [30] it was shown that after the dimensional reduction on the manifold m0  m1 
. . . mn when the composite p -brane ansatz for elds of forms is considered the problem
is reduced to the gravitating self-interacting  -model with certain constraints imposed.
(for electric p -branes see also [22, 23, 31].) this representation may be considered as a
tool for obtaining dierent solutions with intersecting p -branes. in [30, 31, 41, 42, 43] the
majumdar-papapetrou type solutions (see [52]) were obtained (for non-composite case
see [22, 23]). these solutions corresponding to ricci-at factor-spaces (mi, gi) , ( gi
is
metric on mi ) i = 1, . . . , n , were also generalized to the case of einstein internal spaces
[30]. earlier some special classes of these solutions were considered in [16, 12, 14, 25,
26, 27]. the obtained solutions take place, when certain (block-)orthogonality relations
(on couplings parameters, dimensions of branes, total dimension) are imposed.
in
this situation a class of cosmological and spherically-symmetric solutions was obtained
[36, 44, 46]. special cases were also considered in [18, 32, 34, 35]. the solutions with the
horizon were studied in details in [15, 28, 29, 36, 38, 41, 44, 47].

in models under consideration there exists a large variety of toda-chain solutions,
when certain intersection rules are satised [36]. cosmological and spherically symmetric
solutions with p -branes and n internal spaces related to am toda chains were previously
considered in [18, 19] and [45, 48]. recently in [49] a family of p -brane solutions depending
on one harmonic function with next to arbitrary (up to some restrictions) intersection
rules were obtained. these solutions are dened up to solutions of laplace and toda-
type equations and correspond to null-geodesics of the sigma-model target-space metric.
here we consider a family of spherically-symmetric and cosmological type solutions
from [49] (see sect. 2) and single out a subclass of black-hole congurations related to
toda-type equations with certain asymptotical conditions imposed (sect. 3). these black
hole solutions are governed by functions hs = hs(r) obeying a set of second order non-
linear dierential equations with some boundary relations imposed. for positively dened
scalar eld metric (h) all p -branes in this solution should contain a time manifold (see
proposition 1 from sect. 3). this agrees with theorem 3 from ref. [44] (for orthogonal
case, see also [38]).

in sect. 4 we suggest a hypothesis: the functions hs are polynomials when intersection
rules correspond to semisimple lie algebras. this hypothesis (conjecture 1 ) it is also
conrmed by special black-hole block orthogonal solutions considered earlier in [39, 41,
47, 46]. an analogue of this conjecture for extremal black holes was considered earlier in
[33] (see conjecture 2 in sect. 7).

in sect. 5 explicit formulas for the solution corresponding to the algebra a2 are ob-
tained. these formulas are illustrated by two examples of a2 -dyon solutions: a dyon in
d = 11 supergravity and kaluza-klein dyon. in sect. 6 post-newtonian parameters 
and  corresponding to 4 -dimensional section of the metric are calculated (for special

2

block orthogonal case see [46, 47]). in sect. 7 extremal black hole solutions are consid-
ered. these solutions forms a subclass in a class of more general solutions depending on
one harmonic function obtained recently in [49].

remark 1. here we identify notations for gi and gi , where gi = p

i gi is the pullback
of the metric gi to the manifold m by the canonical projection: pi : m  mi , i =
1, . . . , n . an analogous agreement will be also kept for volume forms etc.

due to (2.13) and (2.14), the dimension of p -brane worldsheet d(is) is dened by

d(is) = nas  1,

d(is) = d  nas  1,

(2.40)

for s  se, sm respectively. for a p -brane: p = ps = d(is)  1 .
the solutions are valid if the following restrictions on the sets a,v are imposed.
these restrictions guarantee the block-diagonal structure of the stress-energy tensor, like
for the metric, and the existence of  -model representation [30] (see also [25]). we denote
w1  {i|i  {2, . . . , n},
di = 1} , and n1 = |w1| (i.e. n1 is the number of 1-dimensional
spaces among mi , i = 1, . . . , n ).
restriction 1. let 1a) n1  1 or 1b) n1  2 and for any a   , v  {e, m} ,
i, j  w1 , i < j , there are no i, j  a,v such that i  i , j  j and i \ {i} = j \ {j} .
restriction 2. let 2a) n1 = 0 or 2b) n1  1 and for any a   , i  w1 there are
no i  a,m , j  a,e such that i = {i}  j .
|a,e| +|a,m| = 1 ,
these restrictions are satised in the non-composite case [22, 23]:
(i.e when there are no two p -branes with the same color index a , a   .) restriction 1
and 2 forbid certain intersections of two p -branes with the same color index for n1  2
and n1  1 respectively. restriction 2 is satised identically if all p -branes contain a
common manifold mj (say, time manifold).
this solution describes a set of charged (by forms) overlapping p -branes ( ps = d(is)

1 , s  s ) living on submanifolds of m2  . . .  mn .

2.1 u s -vectors and scalar products

here we consider a minisuperspace covariant form of constraints and corresponding scalar
products that will be used in the next section. the linear constraints (2.33)-(2.36) may
be written in the following form

u r(c) = u r

aca = 0,

u r(c) = u r

aca = 0,

r = s, 1 , where

s = (as, vs, is)  s , and

(u s

a) = (diiis,sas),

(u 1

a) = (1

i + di, 0),

a = (i, ) .

(u s, u s

) = bss,

(2.49)

s, s  s (see (2.21)). it follows from (2.23) and (2.49) that the vectors u s , s  s ,
are linearly independent. hence, the number of the vectors u s should not exceed the
dimension of the dual space (rn+l) , i.e.

we also get [30]

and scalar elds in (2.5) and (2.6).

we note that the solution under consideration in a special case of am toda chain was
obtained earlier in [45]. special a1  . . .  a1 toda case, when vectors u s are mutually
orthogonal, was considered earlier in [36] (for non-composite case see also [32, 34, 38]).

[39, 46].

w = 1, m1 = sd1,

g1 = d2

we also assume that

d1 is the canonical metric on a unit sphere sd1 , d1  2 . in this case 1 = d11 .

m2 = r,

g2 = dt  dt,

i.e. m2 is a time manifold.

proof. let e be a manifold described by relations (3.18)-(3.19). this manifold is an
ellipsoid. indeed, due to positively deniteness of (h) the matrix gab has a signature
(, +, . . . , +) , since the matrix (gij) from (2.47) has a signature (, +, . . . , +) [53].
due to relations (u 1, u 1) < 0 , (u 1, u s) = 0 , (u s, u s) 6= 0 for all s  s , and (2.23)
the matrices (bss) and (ass) are positively dened and all hs > 0 , s  s . then,
the quadratic form in (3.19) has a pseudo-euclidean signature. due to (u 1, u 1) < 0 the
intersection of the hyperboloid (3.19) with the (multidimensional) plane u 1
aza = 0 gives
us an ellipsoid. its intersection with the planes u s
aza = 0 , s  s , give us to an ellipsoid,
coinciding with e .
let us consider a function f| : e  r that is a restriction of the linear function (3.21)

the boundary conditions (3.40) and (3.41) play a crucial role here, since they single

out, generally speaking, only few solutions to eqs. (3.39).

moreover for some values of parameters  = / d , s and q2

s the solutions to eqs.
(3.39)-(3.41) do not exist. indeed, from (2.27), (2.38), (3.12), (3.17), (3.24), (3.30) and

we note that the solution to eqs.

example occurs in the case of one p -brane, when hs > 0 , s = +1 and 2hs > q2
s . in
this case we have two solutions to (3.39)-(3.41) corresponding to two possible values of
qs(0) .

thus, we obtained a family of black hole solutions up to solutions of radial equations
(3.39) with the boundary conditions (3.40) and (3.41). in the next sections we consider
several exact solutions to eqs. (3.39)-(3.41).

remark 3. let mi = r and gi = dt dt for some i  3 . then the metric (3.34)
has no a horizon with respect to the second time t for r d  2 . thus, we a led to
a single-time theorem from [44]. relation (3.22) from proposition 1 coincides with the
no-hair theorem from [44].

4 polynomial structure of hs for lie algebras

(4.1)

where hs(z) > 0 , f = 1  2z ,  > 0 , z = r d , bs = bs/ d2 6= 0 . eqs. (3.41) and
(3.40) read

hs((2)1  0) = hs0  (0, +),
hs(0) = 1,

it seems rather dicult to nd the solutions to a set of eqs. (4.1)-(4.3) for arbitrary
values of parameters  , bs , s  s and quasi-cartan matrices a = (ass) . but we may
expect a drastically simplication of the problem under consideration for certain class of
parameters and/or a -matrices.

in general we may try to seek solutions of (4.1) in a class of functions analytical in a

disc |z| < l and continuous in semi-interval 0 < z  (2)1 . for |z| < l we get

meanwhile there exist solutions to eqs. (4.1)-(4.3) of polynomial type. the simplest

example occurs in orthogonal case [15, 28, 29, 36, 38], when

for s 6= s , s, s  s .

in [39, 46, 47] this solution was generalized to a block orthogonal case:

s = s1  . . .  sk,

(4.8)

si 6=  , i.e. the set s is a union of k non-intersecting (non-empty) subsets s1, . . . , sk ,
and

(u s, u s

) = 0

(4.9)

for all s  si , s  sj , i 6= j ; i, j = 1, . . . , k . in this case (4.6) is modied as follows

hs(z) = (1 + psz)bs

(4.10)

where bs

for s, s  si , i = 1, . . . , k . parameters ps 6= 0 satisfy the relations (4.7) and
ps = ps
parameters bs are also coinciding inside blocks, i.e. bs = bs for s, s  si , i = 1, . . . , k .
in this case hs are analytical in |z| < l , where l = min(|ps|1, s  s ).

4.2 proof of conjecture 1 for am and cm+1
first, we prove the conjecture for simple lie algebras am = sl(m + 1) , m  1 . let us

this lagrangian may be obtained from the standard one [59] by separating a coordinate

using the result of a. anderson [60] we present the solution to eqs.

(4.13) in the

solution with bs = 1 (see [60]) by a certain shift qs 7 qs + s .

if bs > 0 , s  s , then all wr, vr are real and, moreover, all vr > 0 , r = 1, . . . , m+1 .
in a general case bs 6= 0 , s  s , relations (4.16)-(4.19) also describe real solutions
to eqs. (4.13) for suitably chosen complex parameters vr and wr . these parameters
are either real or belong to pairs of complex conjugate (non-equal) numbers, i.e., for
example, w1 = w2 , v1 = v2 . when some of bs are negative, there are also some special
(degenerate) solutions to eqs. (4.13) that are not described by relations (4.16)-(4.19), but
may be obtained from the latter by certain limits of parameters wr .

now we consider am -solutions with asymptotics (3.10). in this case all w1, . . . , wm+1

now we prove the conjecture for simple lie algebras cm+1 = sp(m + 1) , m  1 .

matrix of the lie algebra a2m+1 (see (4.14)) with s = m, . . . , 0, . . . , m , if the following
identications : bk = bk and hk = hk , k = 1, . . . , m , are adopted. this proves the
conjecture for cm+1 , since it was proved for a2m+1 .

5 some examples

5.1 solution for a2

here we consider some examples of solutions related to the lie algebra a2 = sl(3) .
according to the results of previous section we seek the solutions to eqs. (4.1)-(4.3) in
the following form (see (4.12); here n1 = n2 = 2 ):

(5.1)

where ps = p (1)

s

and p (2)

s

hs = 1 + psz + p (2)

s z2,
6= 0 are constants, s = 1, 2 .

the substitution of (5.1) into equations (4.1) and decomposition in powers of z lead

us to the relations

 ps(ps + 2) + 2p (2)

s = bs,
s (ps + 4) = ps+1 bs,

(5.4)

corresponding to powers z0, z1, z2 respectively, s = 1, 2 . here we denote s + 1 = 2, 1 for
s = 1, 2 respectively. for p1 + p2 + 4 6= 0 the solutions of (5.2)-(5.4) read

p (2)

s =

psps+1(ps + 2)
2(p1 + p2 + 4)
ps(ps + 2)(ps + 4)

,

,

bs = 

p1 + p2 + 4

s = 1, 2 . for p1 + p2 + 4 = 0 there exist also a special solution with

p1 = p2 = 2,

2p (2)

s = bs > 0,

b1 + b2 = 42.

thus, in the a2 -case the solution is described by relations (3.34)-(3.38) with s =

{s1, s2} , intersection rules (2.52), or, equivalently,

5.2 a2 -dyon in d = 11 supergravity

consider the truncated bosonic sector of d = 11 supergravity (truncated means

where rankf = 4 . in this particular case, we consider a dyonic black-hole solutions with
electric 2 -brane and magnetic 5 -brane dened on the manifold

(m2 = r)  m4 . the branes are intersecting on the time manifold m2 = r . here
ks = (u s, u s) = 2 , s = 1 for all s  s . the a2 intersection rule reads (see (2.52))

qs/gm . this parameter is obtained without knowledge of the general solution for hs
and does not depend upon the quasi-cartan matrix and, hence, upon intersections of p -
branes. the parameter  depends upon ratios ps/gm , where ps are functions of gm ,

21

qs and a = (ass) . the calculation of  needs an exact solution for radial functions
hs .

relations (6.12) and (6.14) coincide with those obtained in [46, 47] for block-orthogonal

case, when charges qs (and ps ) are coinciding inside blocks.

for the most interesting from physical point of view p -brane solutions with s = 1

and d(is) < d  2 (for all s  s ) (6.14) implies

h(x)  0 for |x|  + and hs(0) = 1 ( s  s ) imply the asymptotical atness of
the (1 + d0) -dimensional section of the metric. a black hole corresponding to a point
(horizon) b  x carries brane charges qsqb , s  s . since the solution is invariant under
the replacement of parameters: qs 7 qs , qb 7 qs/ ,  > 0 , b  x , s  s , we may
normalize parameters qb by the restriction

qb = 1.

8 conclusions

thus here we obtained a family of black hole solutions with intersecting p -branes with
next to arbitrary intersection rules, see relations (2.22), (2.23) and restriction 1. (re-
striction 2 is satised, since all p -branes have a common time manifold.) the metric of
solutions contains n 1 ricci-at internal space metrics. the solutions are dened up
to a set of functions hs obeying a set of equations (equivalent to toda-type equations)
with certain boundary conditions imposed. we suggested a conjecture on polynomial
structure of hs for intersections related to semisimple lie algebras and proved it for am
and cm+1 algebras, m  1 .. we obtained explicit relations for the solutions in the a2
case and considered two examples of a2 -dyon solutions: one in d = 11 supergravity

24

and another in 5 -dimensional kaluza-klein theory. we also calculated post-newtonian
parameters  and  corresponding to 4 -dimensional section of the metric. we presented
 as a function of ratios of physical parameters: charges qs and mass m . the parame-
ter  does not depend upon intersections of p -branes. the parameter  depends upon
intersections. its calculation needs an exact solution for radial functions hs . we also
obtained extremal black hole congurations.
