abstract

we study the non-commutative supersymmetric yang-mills theory at strong coupling
using the ads/cft correspondence. the supergravity description and the uv/ir
relation conrms the expectation that the non-commutativity aects the ultra-violet
but not the infra-red of the yang-mills dynamics. we show that the supergravity
solution dual to the non-commutative n = 4 sym in four dimensions has no boundary
and denes a minimal scale. we also show that the relation between the b eld and the
scale of non-commutativity is corrected at large coupling and determine its dependence
on the t hooft coupling .

classical supersymmetric yang-mills theory (sym) in (p + 1)-dimensional space can
be generalized to sym on non-commutative spaces [1]. since the generalization involves
innitely many higher order terms, it is very hard to provide a pure eld theory proof that
such a theory is consistent at the quantum level. string theory provides a way to obtain
these theories by considering the decoupling limit of d(p2)-branes in type ii string theories
on t 2 with a background nsns 2-form eld b polarized along the plane of the torus [2, 3].
the fact that non-commutative sym is obtained from string theory, in a limit which does
not involve gravity, suggests (if string theory with constant b eld is consistent) that the
non-commutative sym, at least with sixteen supercharges, is a consistent theory at the
quantum level.

in this article, we take advantage of the fact that exactly the same decoupling limit leads
to the near horizon geometry of the dp-branes [4, 5] to learn about the non-commutative
sym at large coupling1. we begin by reviewing the argument of [2, 3] regarding how the
background b-eld gives rise to a non-commutativity of scale . we describe a scaling
limit on the eld theory side which keeps the  nite while sending  to zero to decouple
the stringy excitations. then, we consider the same scaling limit in the dual closed-string
picture, and nd that the background b-eld changes the dynamics of the closed strings only
in the region far away from the horizon (uv), while keeping the dynamics near the horizon
(ir) unaected. we nd that the background geometry does not have any boundary, which
we interpret as the manifestation of the fact that theories on non-commutative spaces do
not have a local uv description.

following [3], we consider d(p  2)-branes in a weakly coupled type ii string theory,
oriented along the x0, ..., xp2 directions. consider compactifying xp1 and xp coordinates
on a square torus of radius r and turn on a constant nsns b-eld polarized along the plane
of this torus. in the absence of the b-eld and in the limit

r
 =

1


= xed,





 0,

(1)

it is natural to describe this system in the t-dual picture of dp-branes wrapping the dual
torus whose size  is macroscopic.

as we shall see shortly, to obtain a nite non-commutativity scale2 in the decoupling

limit, the b eld has to satisfy

2 = b



= xed,





 0.

(2)

thus the b eld has to be very large, and in the presence of such a strong b-eld, the
t-duality is strongly modied. note that since we would like to make contact with the

1related ideas were discussed in [2, 6].
2in the estimate of scales, numerical factors of order one are ignored.

ads/cft correspondence we are using conventions which are natural from the supergrav-
ity point of view. these conventions are dierent then the ones used in the recent non-
4 r d2bxx where
commutative geometry literature. in our conventions sb = 1
x has the dimension of length (if x is compactied then x  x+ 2r) and hence b and g are
dimensionless. the fact that a large b eld strongly modies the t-duality transformation
can be seen from the form of the transformation of the matrix e [7] which in our notations
takes the following form:

e =

r2
 (g + b) =

r2

 


1 b

b 1 
 .

t-duality takes e to e 1 and so the dual radius in the presence of b eld is

b = 


2

(3)

(4)

which is not macroscopic, as b vanishes when   0. therefore, in the presence of a
large b eld, we cannot t-dualize to end up with dp-branes wrapping p + 1 macroscopic
dimensions. instead we end up with only p  1 macroscopic dimensions.

on the other hand, due to the dirichlet boundary conditions along the xp1 and the xp

directions, the energy

es =

1


(5)

of a string stretched between the images of the branes is not aected by the b eld. therefore,
from the point of view of the open strings living on the d(p 2)-branes, the theory has p + 1
macroscopic dimensions.

we have concluded that although the d-branes are wrapping only p  1 large directions,
the eld theory living on the branes knows about p + 1 large dimensions! this apparent
mismatch of the number of macroscopic dimensions is disturbing in light of the ads/cft
conjecture which implies a duality between the closed string and open string description
of the branes. the goal of this article is to resolve this discrepancy and to provide an
interpretation of the non-locality in the dual closed string picture. to achieve this goal, it is
useful to rst examine the relation between the b-eld and the non-commutativity scale 
more closely [3].

instead of t-dualizing twice, douglas and hull considered the following chain of duality
transformations. first, they perform a t-duality along one of the cycles. due to the presence
of the b-eld in the background, the dual torus will not be rectangular. the d(p 2)-branes
have now become d(p  1)-branes and the light degrees of freedom of equation (5) are now
momentum modes along the d(p  1)-branes and the winding modes along the short cycle.

d(p  1)-branes on a skewed torus. skewed geometry of the torus gives rise to non-locality
in the open string excitations living on the d(p  1)-brane.

to minimize the energy, winding modes will wind the torus in the shortest path illustrated
in gure 1. therefore, both the momentum and the winding modes have masses of order
1/. due to the skewed shape of the dual torus, however, the winding modes are delocalized
along the d(p  1)-brane world volume by length of order

with such a state is of order p = /w. combining these results, the scale of non-locality

since the b eld has a nite eect on the eld theory living on the brane in the limit (1)
and (2), it should also have a nite eect on the dual supergravity description of the theory.
at rst sight this does not seem to be the case, since on the closed string side of the duality
we do not end up with p + 1 large dimensions. the resolution stems from taking proper
account of the eect of the d-brane background geometry in the near horizon region. for
concreteness, let us concentrate on the conformal case by setting p = 3. our conclusions
can be generalized immediately to the non-conformal cases with p 6= 3. the string frame
solution in the presence of d1-branes and their images coming from the t 2 compactication
is [9]3

we see that in the near horizon region the longitudinal directions shrinks while the transverse
directions blow up. proper treatment of this eect amounts to setting g22 and g33 equal to
f 1/2 instead of 1 in equation (3). therefore, in the near horizon limit, g22 and g33 blow up
just at the right strength to compete with the eect of the b eld. applying t-duality to

with periodicities x2  x2 + 2 and x3  x3 + 2. to avoid the nite size eects we take
  . in the spirit of [4] we conjecture that the type iib string theory on this background
is dual to non-commutative sym with non-commutative x2-x3 plane.

equation (10) is the main result of this paper. it describes the dual supergravity back-
ground corresponding to the same scaling limit used to dene sym on non-commutative
geometries. let us pause and make a few comments on the qualitative features of (10).

 the geometry (10) is the eective description of our system when the curvature and the
coupling are small. according to (10), the dilaton is small everywhere in the large n limit.
unlike in ads the invariant curvature in string units depends on u. however, it is always
of the order of the ads curvature, 1/. thus for large t hooft coupling we can trust the
solution everywhere. notice that after the t-duality the b eld is not a constant and hence
h 6= 0.
 the observation of [4] that u plays the role of energy scale on the eld theory side is not
modied by  as the energy of a string stretched between the collection of the branes and

a probe brane is the same as in the ads case. this follows from the fact that  does not
modify the relation gttgu u =  which determines the energy of the string. alternatively,
in the d1-branes language, before the t-duality, the presence of the b eld does not modify
the energy of the open strings.

 the isometries of equation (10) are so(1, 1)  so(2)  so(6). so(1, 1)  so(2) and
the translation invariance are the remnants of the so(4, 2) of ads5. the fact that the
conformal and special conformal transformation are broken follows from the presence of the
scale . the fact that lorentz invariance is broken to so(1, 1)  so(2) agrees with the
eect of equation (7) on the eld theory side. the so(6) is the isometry of the 5-sphere,
and corresponds to the su(4) r-symmetries of the n = 4 supersymmetry algebra. the
fact su(4) is not broken by the non-commutativity implies that the supersymmetry is not
broken by the non-commutativity either. note that since the conformal invariance is broken
the number of supercharges is 16 and not 32. furthermore, the background is not self-dual
with respect to s-duality.

 the presence of a nite non-locality scale implies that the dynamics at large distances
(compared to the non-locality scale) is not aected while the short distances dynamics is
drastically changed. this is exactly what we see in the supergravity description. equation
(10) describes the usual ads5 s 5 solution with a constant dilaton in the ir (u  0), while
the solution is strongly modied in the uv. on the supergravity side the non-commutativity
scale can be read o from the point at which the modication to the ads5  s5 background
becomes of order one. this happens at

u =

1/4


.

(11)

using the uv/ir relation [11, 12], l  /u, we nd that at large t hooft coupling the

non-commutativity scale is not  = b but rather6

 = 1/4 = b



1/4.

(12)

the fact that the  is dierent than  is an indication that the relation between b and the
non-commutativity scale receives quantum corrections. it would be interesting to study the
corrections in perturbation theory.

although the discussion above provides some evidence that the theory acquires a new
dynamical scale at 1/4, we have not yet demonstrated (other than by construction) that
this scale is associated with non-commutative geometry. non-commutative geometry has a
built in minimal distance scale, and we would like to see this from the supergravity point of

6the general expression for arbitrary p is  = 2(5p)/(7p)1/(7p).

view. a clean way to see that there is such a minimal distance is the following. let us add
a non-commutativity scale in the x0-x1 plane (by starting with type iib d-instantons in the
presence of b23 and b01). the corresponding supergravity solution (in the euclidean space)
is

(13)

to simplify the discussion, let us set 01 = 23 = 7. this geometry is manifestly invariant
under the transformation

u =

1/2
u2 .

(14)

as we mentioned earlier, this geometry asymptotes to ads5  s5 in the small u (ir) limit.
thus from the ir point of view the boundary should be at u = . however, as a result
of the u  u invariance, the u   limit is also ads5  s5. so from the uv point
of view the boundary should be at u =  and therefore at u = 0.
in fact the space
described by equation (13) is essentially two ads spaces which are glued together in such
a way that geodesics starting from the region near the horizon of one of the ads spaces
reach the interior of the other ads, and so this space has no boundary8. now, a local eld
theory is dened at short distances, and in terms of the ads/cft correspondence this means
that the microscopic structure of the theory is encoded on the boundary of the ads space.
having a non-commutative theory would imply that we should not be able to dene the
theory at short distances. the fact that our geometry has no boundary is the supergravity
manifestation of this fact, and the minimal distance scale is set by the self-dual.

we should stress that (14) is not a duality. only the string frame metric is invariant under
this transformation9. the same is not true for the metric in the einstein frame because
of the non-trivial dilaton background.
in fact, the einstein frame metric asymptotes to
ten dimensional minkowski spacetime at large u. this might be a useful observation in
attempts to understand at space-time holography. despite the fact that (14) is not a
duality, it resembles a similar relation in t-duality. perhaps this analogy will prove useful
for the future investigations of non-commutative sym.

the goal of this investigation was to understand the mechanism of non-locality in the
non-commutative sym at large gauge coupling from the dual supergravity description. we

7this case is the one relevant for [13].
8the background (10), corresponding to the case of vanishing 01, does have a boundary at u =  but

were guided by the intuition that when the eect of non-locality of order  in sym is turned
on, the dynamics at length scales longer than  is unaected, whereas the dynamics at length
scales smaller than  is drastically changed. we formulated a scaling limit of open string
dynamics which keeps  xed while sending  to zero. following the same scaling limit
and applying t-duality, we obtained the background geometry (10). in the u  0 limit,
this geometry asymptotes to the usual ads5  s5 geometry, conrming our expectation
that the ir dynamics is unaected by non-commutativity. as u is increased, the geometry
starts to deviate from its ads limit. because of the u  u invariance, the geometry in
the u   limit is also an ads5  s5 geometry, whose natural radial coordinate is u .
we nd therefore that the supergravity dual to the non-commutative sym does not have a
boundary, unlike the previously encountered examples of the boundary/bulk correspondence.
although this might seem surprising at rst sight, it follows quite naturally from the fact
that eld theories on non-commutative spaces do not admit a local uv description. the
scale of non-commutativity  = 1/4 can be read o from the self-dual scale of the u  u
transformation. this non-commutativity scale disagrees with the non-commutativity scale
computed in the weakly coupled limit in [3] by a certain functional dependence on the t
hooft coupling constant . we interpret this to mean that the relation between  and the
background b eld receives quantum corrections.
