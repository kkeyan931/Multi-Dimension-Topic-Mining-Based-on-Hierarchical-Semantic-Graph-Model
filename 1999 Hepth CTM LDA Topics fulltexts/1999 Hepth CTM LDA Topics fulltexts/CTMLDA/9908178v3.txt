we inspect the excitation energy spectrum of a conning string in terms of solitons in an eec-
tive eld theory model. the spectrum can be characterized by a spectral function, and twisting and
bending of the string is manifested by the invariance of this function under a duality transforma-
tion. both general considerations and numerical simulations reveal that asymptotically the spectral
function can be approximated by a simple rational form, which we propose becomes exact in the
yang-mills theory.

the ground state energy of a long conning string is proportional to its length l. when l decreases there will be

corrections, and in qcd we expect for the ground state energy of the conning ux [1]

e0(l) =   l +  +

c
l

+ o(

l2 )

(1)

here  is the string tension,  the intercept, and c = 
12 is a universal constant, the casimir energy of zero-point
uctuations that can be computed from the nambu-goto action in the gaussian approximation [1]. unfortunately,
a simple nambu-goto action becomes insucient when we attempt to describe the excitation energy spectrum. now
there are additional contributions that can lead to large deformations even when the underlying displacements remain
tiny. for example, a small torsional rotation around the axis of a long string can cause distant cross-sections to rotate
through large angles. similarly, if a long string is slightly bent its ends can move over considerable distances.

in the present letter we propose an eective eld theory approach to describe the excitation energy spectrum
of a conning string. the string appears as a soliton in the eective eld theory, which enables us to account
for contributions such as bending and twisting at the (semi)classical level. this provides us with an appropriate
background, to systematically investigate quantum corrections. quantitatively, our arguments are based on the
classical action [2]

(2)

the order parameter n is a three-component unit vector n  n = 1 and e2 is a coupling constant that determines
the length scale. this action is known to support closed knotted strings as solitons [3] - [4]. according to [5], it
also represents a universality class that describes su(2) yang-mills theory in the long wavelength limit. indeed, (2)
does emerge from the yang-mills theory in a derivative expansion [6]. thus it becomes natural to use its string
solutions to inspect properties of the conning ux in the yang-mills theory. however, ultimately we wish to employ
universality to propose that our results remain valid even beyond the steps that lead to (2). for this we shall combine
duality arguments with a familiar problem in the classical theory of elasticity, the evaluation of the free energy that
describes elastic deformations of a thin rod [7]. at least to the extent our results parallel those in the classical theory
of elasticity, we expect their validity to reach beyond the specic details of (2).

classically there are exactly two intrinsically small deformations of an elastic rod that can be accompanied by
large global displacements, twisting about its axis and bending [7]. when a straight elastic rod is twisted around its
axis, each transverse section becomes rotated by some relative angle. we align the coordinates so that the axis of
the rod coincides with the z-axis and denote by  the (local) twist angle, dened as the angle of rotation per unit
length of the rod around its axis. for a constant  a rod with length l acquires a total twist  =  l along its length.
combining (1) with the results in [7] we then expect that the free energy of a straight, twisted conning string has
the form

here t = 1
2  counts the number of twists around the axis, c is a form-factor that characterizes the string, and
the variable  = l/|t | denotes length per twist. we note that (3) exhibits a   a/ duality, reminiscent of the
t-duality in (super)string theories. when the number of twists t remains xed the self-dual point  = a minimizes
the ensuing contribution which yields

emin(q)  2a  |t | +  + o(

in the eld theory model (2) a straight twisted string is described by an axially symmetric conguration, in

cylindrical coordinates

n(r, , z) = 


sin(k +  z) sin (r)
cos(k +  z) sin (r)

cos (r)




(5)

where k is an integer that counts the degeneracy. we substitute (5) into (2), and by dening  = er a dimensionless

we draw attention to the similarity in the functional forms of (3) and (6) which can be used to relate the parameters
 and c to integrals over (). here we have introduced the hopf invariant h, explicitely with f = (n, dn dn) = da

h =

so that for a straight string the hopf invariant reduces to the number of twists h = t that a conguration with
length l makes around the z-axis (including the multiplicity k).

the prole () that minimizes the energy (6) solves the pertinent euler-lagrange equation. since this equation
depends nontrivially on the various parameters in (6), we expect a priori that the solution also attains a nontrivial,
nonlinear dependence on the parameters. in particular we expect that for an actual minimum energy conguration
the functional form of (6) in l does not stand.

we have performed an exhaustive numerical investigation of the parameter dependence for the conguration ()
that minimizes the energy (6). the result is described by a spectral function f (k2, ). it depends on the integer k2
and the dimensionless combination  = (le)/(2|h|) which measures length per hopf invariant. quite surprisingly,
we nd that the functional form (3) persists: we nd that to a very high degree of accuracy the energy of an actual
straight string solution is interpolated by a simple rational spectral function

emin(k2, )

42e

= |h|  f (k2, )  |h| (cid:16) a + b +

c

(cid:17)

(7)

where a, b, c are k2 dependent numerical coecients. in gure 1 we plot (7) for k = 1, together with several numerically
computed values of the energy. the high degree of accuracy of the rational spectral function (7) over a wide range of
values in  and k2 leads us to propose that this simple rational form might actually be exact for the straight string
solutions of (2) (or at least to a slight perturbation of (2) within its universality class).

we note that (7) has a denite, manifest modular structure as it should. namely, suppose we split a string into
two so that the total energy remains intact. obviously, the spectral form of the energy for both of the resulting strings
should also coincide with (7). since the hopf invariant |h| is additive and  denotes length per hopf invariant, we
conclude that (7) indeed does have the requisite property under splitting and joining.

2

the denite rational form (7) leads to additional observations. for this we rst note that if  = c minimizes
(7), in parallel with (3) the spectral function in (7) exhibits a   2
c/ duality. in order to interpret this duality
we consider a string with dirichlet-type boundary conditions that clamp the ends which keeps h intact. according
to (7) the string has a tendency to adjust its length  towards  = c i.e. towards the self-dual point of the spectral
function that minimizes the energy: when  < c the value of  has a tendency to increase, but when  > c there
is a tendency for  to decrease.

we recall the relation between hopf invariant h, twist t and writhe w [8]

h = t + w

(8)

from this we conclude that for  6= c the string has a tendency to supercoil: when  < c it becomes energetically
favourable for the string to dilate. this tends to decrease twist t , hence there is a tendency to increase writhe w.
similarly, when  > c it becomes favourable to contract which can lead to an increase in twist at the expense of
writhe. as a consequence the   2
c/ duality of the rational spectral function becomes related to supercoiling. it
can map a supercoiled conguration with an excess amount of twist to a (dual) supercoiled conguration with an
excess amount of writhe but with an equal amount of energy: since the hopf invariant h does not change when we
exchange t  w, we have a twist-writhe duality mapping that exchanges t  w and sends   2
c/ but leaves the
the spectral function intact. the energy (7) is invariant under this twist-writhe duality transformation, it determines
a symmetry in our eective eld theory [9].

the previous arguments are based on the inspection of a straight string. but a conguration with a nontrivial
writhe can not be straight, it must be bent. for this we recall from classical theory of elasticity that the free energy for
bending of a thin elastic rod, uniformly bent over a length l, has the form e = l/r2 with r the (mean) radius of
curvature and  a form factor that characterizes the rod [7]. suppose we consider a straight conning string with hopf
invariant h and a constant rate of twist along the string. we bend the string slightly in a uniform and non-planar
manner, with a constant radius of curvature r. this leads to a decrease in twist and, since h remains intact, to a
nontrivial writhe which we describe by a constant rate of increment  along the string. for small  the length l()
of the string scales in proportion to  according to l() = l0 + c  r, where l0 is the (planar) component of the
length that does not contribute to the writhe and c is a numerical constant; for simplicity we set c = 1. when we
combine the free energy for bending with the ensuing free energy (3) for stretching and twisting, we conclude that to
a leading order the free energy of our string acquires the following  dependence,

e() = l() + 2 

(h  )2
l()

+ 2

(9)

with  and  some parameters.

we rst consider the minimum value of the free energy (9) when we minimize it w.r.t. the rate of increment  by

keeping the hopf invariant h xed. we get

emin = 2(  ) 



r (cid:18)|h| +

l0

r (cid:19)

(10)

where we have dened 2 = 2 + 2 + r2. we observe that (10) has the same functional form as (4). this suggests
in particular, that the underlying dual structure persists. for this we subject the free energy to a minimization of ,
with the condition that both the hopf invariant h and the total length of the string l = l0 + r remain xed. we
nd

emin = |h|

(11)

where s2 = 2(l  l0)2 + 2l2. the dual structure is now manifest. we also note that both (10) and (11) are
consistent with the expected modular structure under splitting and joining.

in the eld theory model (2) a stable, bent and twisted conning string is (locally) described by a closed knotted
soliton [3], [4]. the radius of curvature of an actual soliton in general fails to be constant, but since the deviations
from an average r appear to remain small [4] we can expect the main features of (9) to persist. the energy of a closed

3

knotted soliton should then admit an asymptotic expansion in terms of modular invariant quantities such as hopf
invariant and length/average value of the radius of curvature. in particular, we expect that the leading contribution
in this expansion has the manifestly twist-writhe dual functional form (7), (11) of the spectral representation, with the
various parameters now integrals of n evaluated for the soliton. since the soliton minimizes the energy it corresponds
to the self-dual minimum energy point of the spectral function. according to (7), (10) this means that to the leading
order in an asymptotic expansion the energy spectrum of a closed knotted soliton admits the now-familiar functional
form

esoliton =   (|h| +  )

(12)

with some parameters  and  [10]. in particular, since |h| = 1, 2, 3, ... is an integer this energy spectrum is equipar-
titioned, en =   (n + ).

due to the high complexity of the euler-lagrange equations of (2) it becomes dicult to actually check the accuracy
of the asymptotic (12), or to inspect the underlying dual structure. numerical simulations are very demanding [4], and
at the moment we lack computational resources to perform exhaustive simulations. thus we rely on the numerical
results that have been recently published in [4]. there, the energy of various knotted solitons is evaluated for
qh = 1, ..., 8. in gure 2 we compare the data in [4] to the predictions of (12). when we account for the numerical
uncertainties in the data as described in [4], we conclude that the agreement appears quite satisfactory. in particular,
this suggest that for (2) the dual twist-writhe structure is inherent.

in conclusion, we have inspected properties of a conning string by describing it as a soliton in an eective eld
theory. in particular, we have numerically studied the excitation energy spectrum of a straight string. we nd that
it can be described by a spectral function that admits a simple rational form, manifestly invariant under a duality
transformation that relates twist and writhe. we have veried that the presently available 3d data [4] is also consistent
with the simple rational form of the spectral function. this suggests that (2) is at least in the same universality class
with a lagrangian for which a manifestly dual, simple rational form of the spectral function is exact. it becomes
natural to expect that our rational realization of the twist-writhe duality is distinct to an eective lagrangian that
accurately describes the properties of the conning ux in the yang-mills theory.
