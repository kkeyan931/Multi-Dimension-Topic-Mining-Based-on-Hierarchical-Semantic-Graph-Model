(ii) representations based discrete series contain tachyons, massless massive excitations, suciently large |j| (j negative ensure unitarity level-zero states), negative-norm states appear, remain physical spectrum. one possible solution problem cut spin, hoping negative-norm states thus eliminated . rened analysis shows reasonable constraint k 2 j < 0 . straightforward norm computations level two indicate unitar- ity could recovered , even indications no-ghost theorem could exist . however, important issue whether condition consistent features string. an- swer question known. clearly constraint allowed values spin introduces cut-o mass string ex- citations. obvious disagreement usual innite tower masssive states, and, extent, learned far ads/cft conjecture. another relevant related question must face concerns one- order loop partition function. several problems appear there. avoid divergence due innite degeneracy level level, must switch external source coupled cartan generator. allows proper though physically clear denition characters discrete series . apply, however, succes- fully continuous series, whose contribution partition function therefore remains undetermined. ignoring contribution, con- centrating discrete series, conclusive either. one hand, one seriously argue that, within unitarity con- straint, modular invariance cannot reached {$9908189$}. hand, 4 even ignoring unitarity bound, modular-invariant combinations characters known k > 2, technically dicult go beyond, since characters computed, except case irreducible representations. conclusion, one summarize situation follows: framework current-algebra approach, unitarity seems in- compatible consistent physical spectrum, since introduces cut-o mass. may interpreted signal that, present approach, missing sectors, could provide us positive-norm states, whose spin j < k/2, might orig- inate proper treatment target-space boundary conditions. latter hard implement within current-algebra method, might successfully explored following path-integral approach `a la gawedzki . role continuous series could also claried way. although compatible unitarity, corre- sponding excitations seem tachyonic. fair mention one could try alternatively avoid mass/spin cut-o purely tachyonic continuous representations various ways, playing es- sentially current algebra, and/or modifying ane sugawara construction . however, clear whether modications leave unaltered interpretation theory string propagating ads3. motivations studying string ads3 turn wider expected early works. analysis ads/cft conjec- ture, framework ads3s3 background, particular, attracted attention. ideally, would like compute correlators sides compare them. practice, correlators ads3 string states reach, makes rigorous check quite intricate. therefore, work direction devoted trying express space-time well asymptotic two-dimensional con- formal symmetry, terms elds wzw model whose target space bulk ads3 theory, build way boundary conformal eld theory. fair say, however, approach shed light structure ads3 string least re- garding questions raised here;
