(classically, consider half-hypermultiplets. hypermultiplets whose scalars fermions belong (2, 2n) (1, 2n) representations su(2)r sp(n)gauge respectively.) nothing wittens topological anomaly. therefore consider so(2r + 1) gauge theories 7-branes. furthermore, although 7-brane constructions non-simply-laced groups (f2 1 g2) also interesting problems, argue concentrate attention sp(r) group. obtain sp(r) gauge theories 7-branes, lay o+ r d7-branes parallel. conguration following monodromy. msp(r) = 1 4 r 1 ! . (2) monodromy identical set 8 + r d7-branes o, one might expect bps condition junctions two backgrounds identical. however, latter, open string going around o+ endpoints one d7-brane cannot bps state, undesirable string corresponds cartan part sp(r) gauge group. implies modify bps condition. paper, analyze bps condition means hetero/iib duality. {$9709013$}, correspondence quantum numbers heterotic strings t2 ones junctions t2/z2 obtained. orientifold seven planes t2/z2 used {$9709013$} o, cannot use result present purpose. case t2/z2 containing o+, dual heterotic string theory compactied t2 twisted gauge bundle{$9709013$}. section 2, review duality, explain bps condition heterotic strings modied section 3. section 4, give one one correspondence quantum numbers heterotic strings ones junctions suggest modied bps condition junctions. last section devoted conclusions discussions. 2 heterotic/type iib duality section explain duality so(32)1 heterotic string theory compactied t2 non-trivial gauge bundle structure structure type iib theory t2/z2 three one o+ {$9709013$}. let us start heterotic string theory whose x 7 x 8 directions compactied t2 radii r7 r8, respectively. simplicity, assume t2 rectangular ns-ns 2-form eld b78 vanishes. let us consider maximal subgroup o(2) o(16) so(32). order realize nontrivial structure gauge bundle torus, introduce wilson lines o(2) o(16) follows: x 7 direction : z exp(2iaa 7ha), x 8 direction : x exp(2iaa 8ha). (3) 1precisely, gauge group so(32) spin(32)/z2. paper, care point discrete subgroups. 2 factors z x o(2) wilson lines, nothing pauli matrices 2 representation. essential non-trivial structure gauge bundle. (in follows, represent torus t2 , t2 means torus trivial structure bundle.) due wilson lines, gauge group so(32) broken o(16). ha aa (a = 1, . . . , 8, = 7, 8) cartan generators wilson lines o(16) respectively. first, carry s-duality transformation obtain type theory t2 . then, perform t-duality transformation along x 7 direction type iia theory. x 7 direction compactied s1 radius r7 type side, type iia theory compactied s1/z2 length er7 = /r7. wilson line z o(2) along x 7 direction breaks gauge group so(32) subgroup o(16) o(16) (here, assume aa = 0.) o(16) factor lives eight d8-branes top one two orientifold eight-planes (o8). x 8 direction compactied s1 radius r8 type theory. existence non-trivial structure gauge bundle t2 , compactication manifold type iia theory direct product s1/z2 s1. non-commutativity wilson lines along x 7 x 8 direction, xzx = z, (4) implies go around s1 along x 8 direction, swap two o8. result, mobius strip compactication manifold type iia theory. order perform t-duality transformation along x 8 direction arrive nal type iib conguration, convenient rearrange mobius strip cylinder. boundary o8 another capped cross cap ((b) fig.1). rearrangement, becomes clear x 8 direction compactied s1 radius 2r8 (not r8). namely, shown fig.1, mobius strip width er7 circumference 2r8 ((a) fig.1) equivalent cylinder length er7/2 circumference 4r8 whose one performing t-duality transformation along s1, obtain t2/z2 radii er7/2 er8/2 = 1/(2r8). (radii t2/z2 mean radii two cycles t2.) t-duality transformation, cross cap transformed o+, o8 boundary transformed two o. refer compactication manifold t2/z 2, orientifold four t2/z2. using series dualities, obtain properties o+. example, let us consider type d-string winding around x 7 direction, s-dual heterotic string winding around direction. rst t-duality along x 7 direction, d-string transformed fractional d-particle o8, whose mirror image itself, 3 2r8 b 4r8 er7 (a) b er7/2 (b) figure 1: mobius strip (a) rearranged cylinder one end capped cross cap (b). thick lines represent orientifold eight-planes. second t-duality along x 8 direction transformed type iib d-string winding number 1/2. winding number 1/2 implies d-string stretched two orientifold planes along x 8 direction. cylindrical representation mobius strip ((b) fig.1), o8, fractional d-particle exists, one side. therefore, type iib d-string also side t2/z 2. fact suggests d-string cannot attached o+. obtain conclusion starting type d-string wrapped around x 8 direction follows: gauge group d-string o(1) = z2, wilson line takes two values 1. t-duality along x 7 direction d-string transformed d2-brane wrapped mobius strip inherits wilson line d-string. rearrange mobius strip cylindrical representation, length cycle along x 8 direction become twice. result, wilson line squared always becomes +1 regardless original value. therefore, possible x 8 coordinate dual type iib d-string unique. consistent fact d-string cannot attached o+. cause, although one d-string cannot attached o+, even number d-strings simultaneously attached regarded d-strings going around o+ turning back. furthermore, number fundamental strings attached orientifold plane is, regardless charge, always even integer. result, conclude f-string charges d-string charges strings attached o+ always even integers. case junctions t2/z2 (with four o), always remove strings attached one four adding null junctions {$9709013$}, shrinked point continuous 4 deformation. however, case, admit improper junctions, contain strings fractional charge, order remove string odd integral charge attached o. hand, f-string charge d-string charge string attached o+ always even integers explained, junction t2/z 2, remove strings attached o+ without introducing improper junctions. therefore, deform junction t2/z 2 standard conguration, strings starting three planes eight d-branes o+ meet together point expressed fig.2.

(31) comparing (17),the reason existence extra 2 factors f that, size t2/z 2 half t2/z2, order give energy winding numbers 10 twice (17). extra 2 factors compensated extra 1/2 factor (26). therefore, expected obtain exactly relations {m, n, k(8)} {d, f} het/t2 - iib/(t2/z2) duality given {$9709013$}. however, one problem. use relation (31), use background. because, unlike orientifold four o, positive r-r charge o+ cannot canceled d7-brane charge, bps background. obstruction overcome using non-bps background follows: allow non-bps congurations, make background setting four anti-d7-branes top o+. brane conguration gives gauge group so(8)4 rank 16. d7 4 d7 4 x 8 (f8, d8) (f7, d7) d7 4 d7 4 o+ x 7 figure 3: background three one o+. bullet represent stack four d7-branes circle set four anti-d7-branes.
