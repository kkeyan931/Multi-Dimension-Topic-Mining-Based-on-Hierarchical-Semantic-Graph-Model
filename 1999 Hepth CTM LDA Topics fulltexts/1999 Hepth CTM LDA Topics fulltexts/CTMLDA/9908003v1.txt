we investigate the eective potential for a scalar 4 theory with spon-
taneous symmetry breaking and nite temperature. all daisy and super
daisy diagrams are summed up and the properties of the correspponding
gap eqation are investigated. it is shown exactly that the phase transition
is rst order.

1 introduction

the investigation of quantum elds at nite temperature is an important prob-
lem for modern cosmology and particle physics. since the pioneering papers by
kirzhnits [1] and linde [2] numerous investigations devoted to the development
of the formalism and to various applications appeared. the best known papers
are the famous ones by weinberg [3] and dolan and jackiw [4]. there are ex-
cellent books [5, 6, 7, 8] and reviews [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] on these topics.
however, the complete understanding of the spontaneous symmetry breaking in
the early universe remains a key problem. it becomes more important as now
all particles of the standard model (except for the higgs) are discovered and
their characteristics like masses are known. hence, a quantitative analysis of the
electroweak phase transition can be made which allows a direct comparison with
the cosmological constraints among which the most important is the possibility
of the baryogenesis scenario [15], [16]. there is a lot of papers devoted to these
problems (see, for instance, [17], [18], [14] and references therein), where the
temperature eects are taken into account with dierent accuracy. of course, in
order to make such calculations reliable, the theoretical foundations of the for-
malism must be deeply understood. but there are some subtle problems to solve
the present paper is devoted to.

the main problem in eld theory at nite temperature with symmetry break-
ing is the presence of long range correlations resp. infrared divergencies [9, 12, 10,
14]. to some extent, the perturbative approach itself became questionable. the
point is the necessity to go beyond perturbation theory, i.e., beyond the simple
expansion in powers of the coupling constant. one has to sum up certain classes
of diagrams and to show that thereafter no infrared (or other) divergencies are
left. there is a large number of papers trying to accomplish this task. quite
early it was understood that the so called daisy diagrams must be summed up.
already in [4] it was said that even more is necessary  one has to consider the
corresponding gap equation (a simplied version of the dyson equation). how-
ever, to our knowledge, up to now no complete investigation of this kind had
been done. for instance, the problem with the imaginary part of the eective
action was not solved completely. frequently, only the high temperature expan-
sions of the corresponding quantities had been used for that investigations (see
for example [19, 18]). although the order of magnitude is captured right by this
approximation, there is a reason to expect that a more correct calculation at
nite (instead of high) temperature may change the results for about 10 ... 20 %
which may be important in cosmological estimates.

in the present paper, in oder to investigate these problems, we consider a
scalar eld theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking at nite temperature.
using functional methods we sum up all daisy and super daisy diagrams and
all tadpole diagrams as well. for the eective mass we obtain the corresponding
gap equation. all important properties of its solutions are derived exactly, ap-

1

proximative methods for numerical calculations are given. the eective potential
is shown to have a rst order phase transition, all characteristic quantities are cal-
culated, numerically where necessary. the imaginary parts of the eective mass
and the eective potential are shown to be absent in the minima of the eective
potential at any temperature. so the summation made turns out to reproduce
the essential properties of the eective potential correctly. further corrections
may add powers in the coupling only. the methods used are in fact transparent
and quite elementary, however some background in functional methods is helpful.
the authors knowledge, this result had not been obtained before. all previ-
ous works have been done in one or other weaker approximation, frequently using
high temperature expansions. we discuss the most important of these approxi-
mations in detail showing their relations to the correct values. as it frequently
happens, the correct approximation is more elegant and technically simpler that
the intermediate ones.

a secondary aim of the present paper is to give a systematic treatment of the
topic. this is of importance as the necessary tools and intermediate results are
scattered over the literature and usually formulated in quite dierent notations
related to dierent approaches.

in the next section the necessary functional formalism is introduced and the
summation of the infrared dangerous graphs is made. in the third section which
constitutes the main part of the paper the gap equuation is investigated and all
important properties of its solution are derived. in the fourth section eective
potential is investigated in detail and the phase transition is shown to be of rst
order.
in the next section the comparison with dierent approaches is made.
the results are discussed in the conclusions and some basic functions used are
collected in the appendix.

2 perturbative eld theory in functional formu-

lation

the appropriate formulation of perturbative quantum eld theory is the func-
tional formulation. we follow the book [20] which gives the most complete treat-
ment of this formalism. similar representations are given in [7] and in [21].

let us rst consider a general euclidean scalar theory with the action

s() =

1
2

k 


3

3 


4

4 .

(1)

we use condensed notations. the arguments of all quantities like the eld  are
dropped. wherever arguments appear they are integrated over. the rst term
in the action is the free part, quadratic in . its kernel is the operation k. in
our case it is

k =   m2 .

2

(2)

in complete notation the action reads

s() = z dx   1

2

(x)(  m2)(x) 


3

(x)3 


4

(x)4! .

the generating functional of the green functions is given by

z(j) = n z d exp  1

2

k 


3

3 


4

4 + j! ,

(3)

(4)

where n is a normalization constant and j (j(x)) is a source. we consider it as
a functional argument. the perturbative representation of z(j) is

z(j) = n exp" 1

2








# exp"

4

4 + j#

,

|=0

(5)

where 
 denotes the variational derivative. by expanding the exponentials the
last formula turns into the representation as the sum over all graphs with lines
 = k1 and generating vertices  
4 4 + j. an actual vertex factor is
the corresponding functional derivative of the generating vertex. a line is hung
up by the variational derivatives between two (or one and the same) vertices.
the generating functional of the connected green functions is known to be

3 3  

w (j) = ln z(j) .

(6)

to pass to the eective action () one has to perform the legendre transforma-
tion. for this reason one introduces the new functional argument  = 
j w (j),
expresses j in terms of  and denes the eective action by

its perturbative expansion is known to be

() = w (j)  j .

() = s() +

1
2

tr ln  + w 1pi(j  1) .

(7)

(8)

here, s is the action (1), the tr ln is the one loop contribution and w 1pi
denotes the one particle irreducible (1pi) graphs contributing to w , by means of
j  1 amputated for their external legs.

now the eective potential is minus the eective action for zero argument1:

1usually this notation is preserved for a constant background eld. up to now the formulas

are completely general and the background is not specied.

ve = (0) .

(9)

3

in the graphical representation it contains the tree contribution s(0) (which is
zero for the action (1)), the tr ln as the one loop contribution and w 1pi(0), the
1pi vacuum graphs of w .

in general, in the representation by graphs, lines closed over one vertex,

,
do appear. in eld theory without external elds or without symmetry breaking
resp. at t = 0 these result in unessential constants and are usually hidden in a
normalization. however, for nite temperature they deliver nontrivial contribu-
tions and must be taken seriously. in fact, from the considered 4-vertex they

appear with two external legs,
. these insertions are called daisy graphs.
they are like mass insertions. as such they cause the known infrared problems.
consequently, they must (and, in fact, can) be summed up completely. the same
holds for tadpole insertions,

, appearing from 3-vertices.

the problem of summation had been tackled repeatedly. diculties arise
with respect to the correct count of the symmetry coecients and beside. here
we use a simple functional method to sum up these insertions completely. from
the point of view of the functional methods as described in the book [20] this is an
easy exercise consisting in adding and subtracting three terms in the action, i.e.,
in redistributing contributions between the free part and the remaining part,
which is treated perturbatively. so we rewrite the action s (1) in the form

s =

1
2

(cid:16)  m2  a2(cid:17)   b2  c + m4 + m3 ,
4 4 + a22 + b2 and m3  

where the new vertex factors m4  
3 3 + c are
introduced. for the moment the parameters a, b and c are arbitrary constants.

(10)

in the functional language all lines closed over one vertex result from the
operation of hanging up lines acting only on that vertex. so, for instance, the
daisies on one 4-vertex are generated by

exp"1

2








# 4 = 4 + 602 + 32

0 ,

(11)

where 0 is  for coinciding arguments (see (12)). a detailed explanation can be
found in [20]. nevertheless, these formulae call for a more detailed explanation
here. first of all, the line  has two ends and, hence, it is the function of two
arguments. for example, in free space it is nothing else than the propagator
. the operation with the functional derivatives reads

exp(ik(xy))

k2+m2

(x, y) = r

the vertex is 4 = r dx (x)4 and the closed line is represented by

0 = (x, y)|x=y = z

dk

(2)4

k2 + m2

(12)

(for the moment we ignore the convergence problems). the index 0 is used
to symbolize that the line (x, y) is taken at x  y = 0. now, in the explicit
notations, the derivatives can be carried out trivially and returning back to the
condensed notations the rhs. of eq.
(11) will be obtained. analogously, the
relation








# 3 = 3 + 30

exp" 1

2

(13)

can be checked. it describes the emergence of the tadpole diagrams from a 3-
vertex.

in order to avoid the appearance of daisies the constants a and b introduced

in eq. (10) may be adjusted accordingly. in demanding

exp"1

2








# m4 = 


4

4

(14)

this goal can be achieved. at this point it must be noted that by adding zero
in eq. (10) we changed the rst part of the action which is the free part giving
rise to the lines (compare eqs. (4) and (5)). hence the mass in the propagator is
changed according to m2  m2 + a2. we denote the line with this changed mass
by a tilde.

from the formula (11) together with the simpler one

exp"1

# 2 = 2 + 0 ,

we obtain

2

in order to fulll the requirement (14) the equations

and

a2 = 3 0

b2 =

must be satised.

in a similar way we obtain from (13)

# m3 =

the parameter c follows to be

c =

 0 .

(18)

(19)

so, by virtue of (14) and (18), no closed lines will appear from the vertices m3
and m4. this is a quite strong consequence because together with the daisy
diagrams also all super daisy2 diagrams appear to be summed up. the same
holds for the tadpole diagrams. this procedure is similar to the concept of the
reduced vertex in [20], p. 38.

the meaning of eq. (16) is well known - it is a special case of the dyson
equation, also called gap equation. we shall follow the latter terminology. to
illustrate this we denote the mass of the line as explicit argument of the function
0 as 0(m), where m 2 = m2 + a2.
in this notation the  without tilde is
0(m). so we drop the tilde in what follows. than eq. (16) becomes

m 2 = m2 + 30(m) .

m has the meaning of the eective mass.

we note the graphical representation of 0(m),

 30(m) =

= 3z

k2 + m 2 .

(20)

(21)

now we turn to the corresponding theory with temperature using the mat-
subara formalism. thereby the formulae given above remain unchanged. further
we introduce the spontaneous symmetry breaking by giving the mass term the
wrong sign. than, after m2  m2 the eld  must be shifted

(x) = c + (x) ,

(22)

in order to quantize in the vicinity of the lower lying minimum of the action,
where c is the condensate eld, a constant, and (x) is to be quantized. after
this substitution the action reads

s =

where 2 = m2 + 3c
instead of (1) and performing the summation of the daisy graphs as explained

2they are also called foam diagrams in [22].

(29)

is the one loop contribution with the mass m in the propagator, see eq. (53).

in the eective action (), (28), as well as in the action (24), the term linear
in  acquired an additional contribution. the eective mass m in the addendum
quadratic in  must obey the gap equation (27) and becomes a function of the
condensate c and of the temperature in this way: m(c; , t ). all higher graphs
with external legs are contained in w 1pi.

in the eective potential ve the rst two terms are the so called tree ap-
proximation. the corresponding minimum of the eective potential is reached at
c = m/ which is at once the condition for the linear term in  to vanish at
tree level and the mass of the eld is m 2 = 2m2, then.

the third term in ve can be represented graphically as

looking like a
eight. the function v1 is a notation for the tr ln contribution and w 1pi(0) are

7

the higher loop graphs without external legs (vacuum graphs). we do not need
to consider them in this paper.

the eective potential has to be considered together with the gap equation
(27). this allows to exclude 0(m) from explicitely appearing in the expression

(30)

which, together with (27), will be used in the following.

the functions 0(m) and v1(m) can be written down quite explicitely. this
had been done in a number of papers. dierent representations are possible. we
collect the two most useful ones in the appendix together with their expansions
for high t which is at once the expansion for small m. these quantities con-
tain ultraviolet divergencies which are removed by a standard procedure which
includes also the xing of the normalization conditions. they are chosen not
to change the minimum of the eective potential known at tree level in case of
zero temperature (the nite temperature contributions are ultraviolet nite and
unique). so we require

v1
c |c=m/

= 0 and

2v1

c

= 0 .

|c=m/

in fact, the supercial divergence degree of vacuum graphs is four. because ve
2 rather than on c, there are only three independent normalization
depends on c
conditions to impose. after the rst two there remains one condition xating the
value of ve at some value of c
it is natural to demand ve(c = 0) = 0.
but the calculation of the corresponding constant to be subtracted from ve is
not easy. so we leave that condition open. in fact, it becomes important only in
gure 4 where it had been adjusted numerically.

2.

the single daisy graph 0, which is in fact the rst graph in the self energy,
has supercial degree two and two normalization conditions have to be imposed.
in the same aim as above we choose

(m 2)

|c=m/ = 0 .

the second condition results in an additive constant. we choose it so that the
equation

(31)

holds. note that this relation holds for the temperature dependent part auto-
matically.

3 solving the gap equation

the solution of the gap equation is the key element of the whole procedure. there
is, of course, no explicit solution. however, the most important properties can
be derived exactly.

2(m 2) as given by the gap equation (27) for  = 5 and

in solving the gap equation (27) we obtain the eective mass m appearing
after summing up the daisy diagrams. it is a function of the condensate c,
further it depends on the bare mass m, on the coupling  and on the temperature
t : m(c; m, , t ). the inverse function, c(m; m, , t ) is given explicitely by
2 = (m 2 + m2  3(m))/3. this function can be easily plotted,
eq. (27): c
see figure 1, for real values of m. as seen, it is not monotone and the inverse
function, i.e., m(c; m, , t ) is not unique. so the gap equation has two solutions
in m for each c. in order to understand that better we consider the graphic
solution of eq. (27). for this we write the equation in the form m 2 = rhs(m)
2 + 30(m) and plot the lhs. and the
with the notation rhs(m) = m2 + 3c
rhs. of this equation as functions of m 2 in one picture, see gure 2. the curve
2 + t 2/4 which follows
for the rhs. starts at m = 0 in rhs|m =0 = m21 + 3c
from (61) where we introduced the notation

1 = 1

82 .

(32)

the derivative is negative there (see the second term in the rhs. of eq. (61) so
2 + t 2/4 > 0 there is a solution close to m = 0. in the
that for m21 + 3c
opposite case there is no real solution there. for large values of m, the curve
describing the rhs. will be dominated by the logarithm, see formula (58). for
3 ln(m 2/2m2)/162  1 it becomes larger than the lhs. and delivers the other
solution, seen in figure 1 as the decreasing part of the curve. it takes place for
large values of  and m (at any t ) and is of no relevance for physical applications.
2 + t 2/4 = 0 the curve of the rhs. starts in the origin and

for m21 + 3c

the solution is exactly m = 0.

in general, the solution of the gap equation is non perturbative and can be
obtained only numerically. however, for the parameters in some range there are
two possibilities for approximative procedures.

3.1 the iterative solution of the gap equation

equation (27) can be iterated. for this we write it in the form m = qrhs(m).

inserting some zeroth approximation m 0 into the rhs. the next approximation
m (1) can be obtained which in turn must be inserted into the rhs. and so on. this
procedure converges until the module of the derivative of the rhs. with respect to
m does not exceed unity. this derivative takes its largest value at m = 0. from
this a sucient criterion for the convergence can be derived. let us consider the
derivative

also, even for  obeying this restriction, the denominator may become small and
make the iteration procedure diverge. in fact, this happens for m close to zero.
in case the sucient conditions are satised the iteration procedure works
 0.

well. it does so even in the complex region, i.e., for m 2 < 0 and down to t >
the solution appears in powers of .

3.2 the approximative solution

instead of iterating the eq. (27) one may approximate it and solve the approx-
imated equation. we restrict ourselves to temperatures of order t >
2 . this

again, it can be seen that for t 2  (cid:16) 4m2
2 + t 2/4 < 0 the solution becomes complex and

2) of the gap equation
the mass squared becomes negative. the solution m 2(c
is shown in gure 3. it is a nearly linear function and follows mostly the tree
2. only near m = 0 it shows a nontrivial
solution, m = , 2 = m2 + 3c
behavior which is the non perturbative region for small m discussed above.
(33) can be established
as follows. first, consider large t . the solution is m = t /2(1 + o()).
second, consider t  1/. the solution is m <
 t . so in both cases the
 or smaller (for example, at
contributions neglected in (61) are of order m
t 
2 +t 2/4 = 0 the solution m = 0 is exact). hence including higher
m21 +3c
order terms into (61) would result in corrections of order . on the other hand
side dropping any of the terms in (61) changes the solution quantitatively. it can
be checked that in doing so even the order of the phase transition changes.

4 the shape of the eective potential and its

extrema

the eective mass and the eective potential can be calculated numerically and
plotted. in the temperature region where the phase transition takes place the
approximative solution (34) of the gap equation together with formula (57) makes
it very easy to plot the eective potential as a function of c, see gure 4. it shows
the typical behavior of a rst order phase transition. this important property
can be shown exactly.

figure 5: plot of the rhs. and of the lhs. (= m) of the gap equation in the
minimum as function of m for  = 1 and several temperatures

the curve for the rhs starts in 2m21  t 2/2 with a positive derivative (cf.
eq. (61)). therefore, for suciently small t there is one real solution. this is the
position of a minimum of the eective potential (for t = 0 one obtains the known
picture of the tree approximation). for t 2  4m21/ the starting point of the
curve representing the rhs. is below the origin and there are two real solutions.
because the eective potential is a continuous function, this second solution must
be a maximum. it appears at smaller values of c than the minimum. so

t =

2m

q1

(38)

is the lower spinodal temperature. raising the temperature lowers the curve
representing the rhs.
further. the two solutions become closer to each other

13

until they merge nally. at that temperature the minimum and the maximum
are at the same place. hence this is the upper spinodal temperature t+. for
even higher temperature there is no real solution and the eective potential is a
monotone function  the symmetry is restored.

because these are exact, non perturbative properties of eq. (37) it is shown

exactly that the phase transition is of rst order.

it is important to note that the eective action is real in both its minima.
for t < t there is only one minimum (that at nite c). there the eective
potential is real. this is clear because the eectve mass is real as shown just
above and because the functions 0(m) and v1(m) are real for real arguments.
in c = 0 the eective potentiual has a maximum and it has an imaginary part.
this corresponds to the instability of this state.

consider t < t < t+. here the eective potential has two minima, one in
c = 0 and the other one at nite c. in both minima (as, in general, for any
t > t) the eective potetential is real. so in the given approximation they
are both stable. in fact, the eective potential should have an imaginary part
in the minimum at c = 0 for t < tc because there is a nite probabiity for a
tunneling transition to the lower lying minimum. but this is beyond the given
approximation.

it is interesting to note that in t = t the eective mass at c = 0 vanishes.
also the second derivative is zero there, see eq. (44). so this point is metastable
as it must be in a rst order phase transition.

these features can be seen explicitely in the expansion for small . using

(61) in the rhs. of eq. (37) we obtain

where the upper sign corresponds to the minimum and the lower sign to the

which the maximum appears at mmax = 0 and is the same as given by formula
(38). further, from formula (39) t+ follows. it is the temperature for which the
position of the maximum and of the minimum coincide, i.e., where the square

figure 6: c/2 in the minimum (resp. maximum) (upper resp.

of the coupling 

the temperature tc, where the minimum of the eective potential equals its

value at c = 0, is in between these two temperatures, closer to t+.

the positions of the minimum and the maximum of the eective potential
as function of the temperature can be calculated from eqs. (37) and (36) nu-
merically. also, they can be taken from (40) except for small values of t where
the approximation made in (39) is not valid. the result is shown in gure 6 for
several values of the coupling .

it is possible to calculate in a quite easy way the depth of the minimum at
t = t. for this we need the potential at c = 0 for this temperature. there
the gap equation has the (exact) solution m = 0. this is just the situation when
the curve representing the rhs.
in gure 2 starts from zero. than by means of
(57) and (29) we obtain

where higher corrections in  are dropped. this is the depth of the minimum at
the lower spinodal temperature.

it is interesting to calculate the eective mass m in the minima of the ef-
fective potential as function of the temperature. this is the so called debye or
temperature dependent mass. for c = 0 it follows from eq. (34). at t = t+ we
4(31)m. in the other minimum it is what we denoted
note the value m0 = 3
by mmin, given by eq. (40) (upper sign). at t = 0 we note mmin = 2m2 which
is the tree value. at t = t we have mmin = 3m/2 and at t = t+ we have
mmin = 3m/4. both are shown in gure 7 as function of the temperature.

another important check of the consistency of the given approximation is
that in the minimum of the eective potential the term linear in  in the eective
action (28) vanishes exactly. this can be seen by inserting c from (36) and
using eq. (37). note that from this the disappearance of all tadpole diagrams in
the green functions, not only in the eective action, follows.

also, the connection between the eective mass and the second derivative
of the eective potential in the minimum can be checked. for this reason we
calculate 2ve/(c

5 comparison with dierent approaches

since the pioneering papers back to the 70th there have been several steps in the
developement of the topic. already in [4] the necessity of summing daisy and
super daisy diagrams was underlined. perhaps the rst summation of daisy
diagrams (also called ring diagrams) for dierent models of quantum eld the-
ories was carried out in [19], later on it was reconsidered in [18] with specic
application to the electroweak phase transition in the standard model. in the
latter paper using some high temperature approximations a rst order phase
transition was obtained where also the imaginary part comes out right. as we
will see below, this is a qualitatively good approximation. detailed information
about properties of the high temperature daisy approximation can also be found
in [17].

5.1 one loop approximation

the simplest approximation is the pure tr ln, which means the one loop con-
tribution to the eective action without summing up any daisy diagrams. the
corresponding expression is simply

v a
e = 

m2

(45)

2 and v1(m) = 1

with 2 = m2 + 3c
2 tr ln(p2 + m2). the function v1 is given
in the appendix, (53), (54). the behaviour of this eective potential is in general
well known, but there are some subtles. in order to encounter them we consider
the extrema of (45) by equating zero its derivative

0(2) ,

whereeq. (31) had been used. this can be rewritten in the form

2 = 2m2  90() .

(46)

(47)

this relation is like eq. (37) with the dierence that the eective mass is 2 =
2 in this case. in complete analogy to eq. (37) the solution can be
m2 + 3c
investigated graphically. figure 5 applies changing merely the coupling according
to   3
2. hence the eective potential has a minimum for t 2 < 8m2/3. for
t 2  8m2/3 there are both, a minimum and a maximum. raising t further
they merge and disappear. these are properties of real solutions, i.e., for 2 > 0,
2 < m2/3 the eective potential is complex. therefore,
i.e., c

2 > m2/3. for c

the general behaviour is that of a second order phase transition. in a narrow
temperature region t 2 >
 8m2/3 the real part has two minima. at t 2 < 8m2/3
the left one is lower and for t 2 > 8m2/3 the right one is the lower one.
in
the left one the eective potential is complex and in the right one it is real. it
seems that the very tiny dip which is shown in gure 8 for  = 1 and in gure
9 for  = 0.1 in the magnication had not been observed before. it is clear that

18

the pure one loop eective potential is unphysical because it is complex in the
minimum at some temperatures. the position if the extrema are shown in gure
11, curves 3,4 and 5 as functions of t . curve 3 shows the minimum where v a
e is
real, on curve 5 it is complex and curve 4 shows the position of the maximum.

5.2

simple daisy diagrams summed up

after summing up all daisy and super daisy diagrams, which resulted in the
eective potential (29) and the gap equation (27) it is quite simple to go the
step back to the simple daisy diagrams summed up by substituting the tree
2 instead of the eective mass m 2 at two places in these

where v1 resp. 0 are the same functions (53) resp. (58) as in section 2. however,
we have to show that (48) and (49) is just the result of summing the simple daisy
diagrams. for this we have to go back to formula (8) and must pick up the daisy
diagrams from w 1pi. we obtain

theless it is interesting to comment on them. v b
e can be plotted qute easily using
the above formulae. it is shown in gure 10 as function of c for several values
2 = m2/3
of the temperature. it has an imaginary part for c
it has a cusp and above it is real. again, the real part has two minima in a
narrow temperature range. in general, the behaviour is quite similar to that of
the simple tr ln. the positions of the minima can be found numerically and
they are shown in gure 11 as curves 6 and 7 (the maximum is not shown there).

5.3 high temperature approximation

frequently high temperature approximations for the functions v1 and 0 are used
which are given by parts of the eqs. (57), (61). another type of approximations
used can be obtained by taking only the l = 0 contribution in the sum over the
matsubara frequencies. a typical example is given in [19]. there, the expression

(52)

has been obtained (see also [18]). here, the phase transition is rst order, the
eective potential is real in its minima. the positions of the maximum are shown
in gure 11 ( curve 8 resp. curve 9). it is seen, the behaviour is similar to that
of the correct solution (curves 1 and 2), but the numbers are about of 10 ... 20
% higher. so we conclude that the simple formula (52) works basically well and
gives a result which is qualitatively correct and quite close to the right numbers.

6 conclusions

in the foregoing sections the eective potential for a scalar theory with sponta-
neous symmetry breaking and nite temperature is calculated. all daisy and
super daisy diagrams are summed up and the properties of the correspponding
gap eqation are investigated. it is shown exactly that the phase transition is rst
order. the imaginary part of the eective action comes out in a correct way.

21

higher corrections may be calculated on the base of the summation made and
will result in small corrections, only.

natural extensions of the present work is the inclusion of fermions, gauge

bosons and external elds.
