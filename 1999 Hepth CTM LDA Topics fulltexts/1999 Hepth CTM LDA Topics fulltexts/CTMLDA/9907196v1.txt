abstract

introduction

relativistic string is a curve moving in d-dimensional minkowski space and sweeping by its motion
a 2-dimensional surface (world sheet). an area of the world sheet is proposed to be an action of the
string.

there are two approaches for the description of string dynamics. covariant approach keeps the
main symmetry of strings action: group of arbitrary reparametrizations of the world sheet, which
should be implemented both in classical and quantum theories. non-covariant approach eliminates
this symmetry, introducing a particular parametrization (gauge) on the world sheet.

in covariant approach the string theory is usually considered in oscillator representation, analo-
gous to the description of eld theories by operators of creation and annihilation. it is well known [1],
that reparametrization group in this approach has anomalies, violating the parametrical invariance
of quantum theory. in special case d = 26 the quantum theory has peculiar properties (an existence
of properly factorizable null subspace), this is usually considered as an indication of its parametrical
invariance.

covariant string theory was also investigated in non-oscillator representations. particularly, a
consideration, done by mezincescu and hennaux in [1] p.157, shows that the theory of closed bosonic
string at arbitrary even number of dimensions, quantized in x, p-representation, has a solution, pos-
sessing quantum parametrical invariance. this fact indicates the absence of anomalies in such rep-
resentation. analogous result was obtained in work [2], which shows, that quantum theory of open
string in pseudo-euclidean space with equal number of spatial and temporal directions (particularly,
d = 3 + 3) can be realized in positively dened extended space of states without anomalies in group
of reparametrizations.

consideration of string theory in covariant approach is related with one diculty. it is shown
in a recent work [3] that the phase space of covariant string theory is much wider than it is usually
assumed. it contains innite regions, lled by classical solutions with negative energies and negative
square of mass, related with existence of folds on the world sheets, see g.1. conditions, excluding
such solutions in classical mechanics, cannot be directly transferred to covariant quantum string
theory1. consistent exclusion of tachionic solutions is possible only in non-covariant approach, when
one chooses a special parametrization of the world sheet.

1work [3] shows that standard covariant quantization of string theory in oscillator representation does not exclude
classical tachionic solutions, but due to a special eect, caused by indeniteness of space of states, redenes their
square of mass in such a way that m 2 < 0  m 2 > 0, and then identies the tachionic solutions with normal ones.

standard parametrization, used in non-covariant approach is light cone gauge. this parametriza-
tion can be obtained in slicing of the world sheet by a set of parallel planes, where one is tangent
to light cone with a center in the origin (g.2). usually the position of such planes is frozen in
the space-time, i.e. lorentz transformations change the location of the world sheet with respect to
the slicing planes. as a result, lorentz transformations change the slices on the world sheet, i.e. are
followed by reparametrization. in this way the common anomaly in reparametrization group appears
also in the group of lorentz transformations2.

a simplest way to avoid this problem was proposed in [4, 5]. in these works lorentz-invariant light
cone gauge was introduced, which relates the slicing planes with the world sheet itself, so that lorentz
transformations move them together the world sheet. in this approach lorentz transformations are
not followed by reparametrization, and on quantum level have no anomalies. quantum mechanics,
based on this idea, was studied by dierent approaches in [5].

another lorentz-invariant parametrization: time-like gauge in center-of-mass frame was intro-
duced by rohrlich [6]. this gauge leads to a complicated hamiltonian mechanics. in full generality
this mechanics was investigated in [7]. in [8, 9] particular nite-dimensional subsets in the phase
space were selected, admitting anomaly-free quantization in d = 3 + 1.

in the present work we describe another lorentz-invariant gauge, which can be considered as
weakened variant of the rohrlichs one. this gauge leads to a simple hamiltonian mechanics and
gives a possibility to construct anomaly-free quantum theory at arbitrary number of dimensions.

1 classical mechanics

theory of closed bosonic string in d-dimensional minkowski space-time is described by canonically
conjugated coordinates and momenta:

{x(), p()} = g(  ), ,  = 0...d  1.

(1)

here x(), p() are 2-periodical functions and () is 2-periodical diracs delta-function. co-
ordinates and momenta are restricted by constraints:

xp = 0,

x2 + p2 = 0.

(2)

2exception is a case d = 26, where the anomalies are absent.

the constraints belong to the rst class in diracs terminology [10]: poisson brackets of constraints
vanish on their surface.

mechanics in center-of-mass frame. total momentum of the string is given by expression
0 d). following [7], introduce orthonormal basis
 =
 is temporal axis (directed along

p = h dp() (here and further h d denotes r 2
of vectors, dependent on total momentum: n 
p/p 2. this basis denes center-of-mass frame (cmf), where n 0
total momentum p) and n i

 = g = diag(+1,1, ..,1), with n 0

, i = 1..d  1 are spatial axes (orthogonal to p).

string dynamics in cmf is dened by a set of new canonical variables (z, p, q(), p()) with

 (p ), n 

 n 

poisson brackets

{z, p} = g,

{z, p0()} = n 0

(),

{q(), p()} = g((  )  ()),

(3)

other poisson brackets vanish. new variables are related with old ones by expressions (for detailed
proofs and derivations look to appendix 1):

q() = x()  x(0),

x() = n 

 x(),

p() = n 

 p(),

x, p are projections of coordinates and momenta onto axes of cmf; mean coordinate z:

z = n 0

x0(0) + 1

2n 

 (n 

 /p)m , m  = i dx[p].

here square brackets denote antisymmetrization: x[p] = xp  xp. variables m  can be
obtained from usual lorentz generators m = h dx[p] by projection to cmf.

new canonical variables are restricted by constraints:

q(0) = 0,

0p 2 i dp() = 0,

which as earlier belong to the rst class.

q 0p0  ~q ~p = 0,

(q 0)2 + (p0)2  ~q 2  ~p 2 = 0,

(4)

time-like gauge in cmf. lets impose a condition (gauge): q0()  0. it introduces a particular
parametrization on the world sheet, requiring that the string x() should always be an equal-time
slice of the world sheet in cmf, see g.3. this gauge gives a possibility to exclude p0() from the
set of independent variables, dening it identically as p0  ~q 2 + ~p 2. remaining variables have

poisson brackets:

{z, p} = g,

{qi(), pj()} = ij((  )  ()), i, j = 1..d  1

(others are zero). the constraints

~q(0) = 0,

i d~p() = 0,

~q ~p = 0, p 2 i dq~q 2 + ~p 2 = 0

(5)

(6)

are again of the rst class. in the spirit of diracs theory of constrained systems [10], each constraint,
being used as hamiltonian, generates canonical transformations in the phase space, representing
symmetries of the system.
in our case the constraints generate reparametrizations of the world
sheet, i.e. the transformations, which preserve the action.

in more details: from (5) one can conclude that the rst two constraints in (6)
have identically vanishing poisson brackets with all dynamical variables and
generate no transformations (they are auxiliary elements of our construction,
not related with any symmetry of the system). the third constraint gener-
ates reparametrizations of the string qi()  qi(), followed by a translation,
shifting new qi( = 0) to the origin  see g.4. this translation is neces-
sary due to the rst constraint in (6). the same translation, but in opposite
direction, is applied to xi(0) (see appendix 1), resulting to pure reparametriza-
tion of equal-time slice xi(). the fourth constraint generates translations of
slicing plane in p direction, and correspondent evolution of equal-time slice,

generated by hamiltonian h = h d~q 2 + ~p 2. this evolution has a period
t = p 2 (evolution, generated by an equivalent constraint (p 2 h 2)/2 = 0,

is 2-periodic).

lorentz generators

are given by expressions, identical to [8]:

m = x[p] + n i

n j

 m ij, x = z  1

2n i

(n j

 /p)m ij.

(7)

here m ij is the tensor of orbital moment of the string in cmf, which in bosonic string model
in the case d = 3 + 1 it is related with spin vector
is identied with the spin of the particle.

~m = h d~x  ~p as m ij = ijkm k.
the clue property: if in quantum mechanics the commutators of z, p are postulated directly from
poisson brackets (5), and the algebra of cmf-rotations so(d  1) is represented correctly by m ij:
[m i, m j] = iijkm k for d = 4, then operators, dened by expressions (7), represent correctly
e.g.
the algebra of lorentz transformations so(d  1, 1). for d = 4 this was proven in [8] by direct
calculation, and for other d can be proven analogously. natural explanation of this fact was also
given in [5]: variables (7) actually generate lorentz transformations of the world sheet together with
the set of slicing planes. they are not followed by reparametrizations of the world sheet, like in
standard light-cone gauge. namely these auxiliary reparametrizations create problems in standard
approach, because they bring anomalies, destroying the lorentz algebra.

2 quantum mechanics

canonical commutators

[z, p] = ig,

[qi(), pj()] = iij((  )  ())

can be realized in a direct product of space of functions (p ) onto the space of functionals [q()],
with denition of operators

z = i



p

,

pi() = i  

qi()  () i d



qi()! .

constraints:

i d~p()  = 0;

~q(0)  = 0;

~q ~p  = 0;

(p 2  h) = 0, h = i dq~q 2 + ~p 2.

(8)

(9)

from the denition of ~p we see that the rst constraint is satised identically for any . to
satisfy the second constraint, we should dene  = (~q(0)). then, we see that ~p commutes

through -factor: ~p(~q(0)) = (~q(0))~p . the second term in ~p is generator of global transla-
tions ~q()  ~q() + ~. requiring that  is translationally invariant3: [~q() + ~ ] = [~q()], we
will have (~q(0))~p  = (~q(0))(i/~q()). for the third constraint: considering linear combina-
tions h d()~q ()/~q(), we see that they act on the state  as generators of reparametrizations
~q()  ~q() + ()~q (). requiring additionally that  is parametrical invariant: [~q()] = [~q()],
we will satisfy the third constraint. the fourth constraint has a form of mass shell condition. to
satisfy it, we should solve eigenvalue problem for operator h (this will automatically determine the
spectrum of mass).

operator h can be dened using an expansion of the square root:

h = i dq~q 2 1 +

1
2~q 2 ~p 2 

1

(4~q 2)2 (~p 2)2 + ...! .

(10)

our next goal is to show, that each term of this expansion acts in the selected space of states, i.e.
functions of the form (~q(0)), where  are translationally and parametrically invariant functionals
of ~q().

formal calculation, given in appendix 2, shows that each term in (10) commutes with the rst
three constraints in (9), and therefore should act in the selected space of states. however, in concrete
calculations the denition of h should be rened, because powers of variational derivative /qi cre-

ate divergencies. particularly, action of /qi() on parametrically invariant integrals h dqjf j(q)
gives local expression q jf [j/qi]|, and (in the case if f [j/qi] is not constant) the next dieren-
tiation /qi() gives a divergency (0)  (q j2f [j/qi]qi). further we will introduce a wide set of
translationally and parametrically invariant functionals, for which h can be reasonably dened.
lets consider parametrically invariant functionals of the form ai(k) = h dqieikq, and took their
translationally invariant products: 1, ai(k)aj(k), ..., ai1(k1)..ain(kn)(k1 + ... + kn). lets dene
/qi()/qi() (classically this corresponds to the same
the powers of variational derivative as lim

pi()pi() = pi()2). in this denition the divergent terms are omitted (each ai(k) in
variable lim

the product is dierentiated once, giving local expression of , and further variational derivatives
with respect to ~q( 6= ) are not applied to it). note that for each product nitely many variational
derivatives can be applied to give non-vanishing result, and expansion (10) is actually truncated
to a nite sum. after all dierentiations and outer integration h d in (10) we obtain well-dened

functional. particularly,

h ai(k)ai(k) = i dqq 2  ai(k)ai(k) i dqq 2 k2 + (d  2)

(q k)2

q 2 ! .

analogous expressions can be written for other products.

remarks
1. the functionals, found in action of h to the products of ai(k), are translationally and paramet-
rically invariant, however, they are not expressed as products of ai(k). if one nds the expansion of
resulting functionals by the products of ai(k), i.e. prove that h acts in the space, spanned by these
products, this will give a possibility to solve eigenvalue problem for h.
2. another technically dicult task is an introduction of hermitian structure in this space of states.
it is known [11], that in theories with non-compact gauge group the scalar product from extended
3in the presence of (~q(0)) the values [~q()] for loops with ~q(0) 6= 0 are not important. assuming translational
invariance of , we actually dene these values to be the same as for loop with ~q(0) = 0. this assumption simplies
further calculations.

space of states is divergent on physical subspace, selected by constraints (it includes an innite vol-
ume of gauge group). therefore, it is needed to introduce a new scalar product, acting in the physical
subspace. hermitian property is required only for operators, acting in the physical subspace, particu-

larly, each term in expansion (10), integrated by h d, should be hermitian operator (not q (), p(),

from which it is composed  separately these operators do not act in the physical subspace).
3. it was noted in the previous section, that the function h 2/2 is action-type variable, generating 2-
periodical evolution. quasiclassically this means that h 2/2 takes integer eigenvalues (e2i(h 2/2) =
1). this property also reects a general symmetry of mechanics [12]: translation by p transforms
the world sheet to itself.
(however, concrete denitions of h can violate this property, and the
described symmetry can be lost.)
4. lorentz group in our approach is free of anomalies, because in generator of cmf-rotations

~m = h d~q  ~p = ih d~q  /~q + i~q(0)  h d/~q the second term vanishes on translationally

invariant functionals (also due to the presence of (~q(0)) in ), and the rst term denes correct
representation of rotation group in considered space of states (acting as rotations of the argument
in [~q()]). rotations obviously commute with all constraints and hamiltonian h, therefore, the
eigenspaces of h should be rotationally invariant, and can be decomposed into a sum of irreducible
representations of rotation group, correspondent to denite values of spin.
5. absence of anomalies in this approach can be also understood in standard oscillator representation
of string theory. here the constraint ~q ~p = 0 can be rewritten as ln  ln = 0, where ln, ln
are generators of virasoro algebra for left and right modes. using a commutator [ln, lm] = (n 
m)ln+m+(d1)/12n(n21)n,m and the same commutator for ln (coecient (d1) is here, because
ln, ln include only (d 1) space-like oscillators from cmf), one can see that ln  ln forms closed
virasoro algebra without central charge. actually, we have imposed a gauge, eliminating anomalous
components in these two virasoro algebras, and preserving their anomaly-free combinations.
6. the gauge introduced here is quite similar to the time-like gauge proposed by rohrlich [6], used
also in works [7-9], an important dierence: the rohrlichs gauge, except of q0 = 0, also supposes
p0 = ~q 2 + ~p 2 = const. this additional constraint does not commute with ~q ~p = 0 (rohrlichs
gauge xes parametrization on equal time slice  our approach preserves this freedom). as a result,
the whole set of constraints, appearing instead of (6), is of the second class, and the reduction to
these constraints leads to a complicated hamiltonian mechanics.

there is one more distinctive feature of the approach [6]  in this work the second class constraints
of the mechanics were imposed onto state vectors, in the spirit: two real constraints x = 0, p =
0,
[x, p] = i  one complex constraint (x + ip) = 0. such interpretation of constraints has
some physical ground (explanation was given in [5]), however, it is not equivalent to the standard
interpretation [10], where imposition of second class constraints is possible only after reduction on
their surface and quantization of the obtained reduced mechanics. the present work and [7-9] use
standard methods of constraints imposition.

conclusion

this work describes a particular gauge in the theory of closed bosonic string, which is applicable in
the space-time with any number of dimensions, and on the quantum level guarantees the absence
of anomalies in lorentz group and the rest of reparametrization group. the main problem consists
in a suitable denition and determination of spectrum for a single operator: quantum analog of

hamiltonian h = h d~q 2 + ~p 2.

appendix 1: canonical transformations

1. canonical variables, dening string dynamics in cmf, were derived in [7], using slightly dierent representation of
string theory. here we will reproduce this derivation in x, p-representation. for this purpose we will use a formalism
of symplectic forms [8, 13].

poisson brackets correspond to a closed non-degenerate dierential 2-form  = 1

2 ijdx i  dx j, dened on the
phase space of the system (which is generally considered as a smooth manifold, endowed by local coordinates x i, i =
1, . . . , 2n). coecient matrix of the form ij is inverse to the matrix of poisson brackets ij = {x i, x j}: ijjk = k
i .
detk{, }k 6= 0. reduction on this surface consists in the substitution of its explicit parametrization x i =
x i(ua) (a = 1, . . . , 2n  r) into the form:

lets consider a surface in the phase space, given by the 2nd class constraints: (x) = 0 ( = 1, . . . , r),

 = 1

2 abdua  dub, ab =

detkabk 6= 0.
matrix kabk , inverse to kabk, denes poisson brackets on the surface: {ua, ub} = ab.
this method is equivalent to commonly used dirac brackets formalism. sometimes it is convenient to combine
both methods: some of the constraints (x) are imposed as above, then dirac brackets on the remaining constraints
n(u) are calculated by denition:

x i
ua ij

x j
ub ,

{ua, ub}d = {ua, ub}  {ua, n}nm{m, ub},

where knmk is inverse to knmk: nm = {n, m}.
in string theory canonical poisson brackets {x(), p ()} = g(  ) correspond to symplectic form  =
h d p()  x(), which is exact, i.e. can be represented as a dierential of 1-form:  = ,  = h d px.
using decomposition x = n 
 h d px +h d px, or after elementary
transformations:  =  1
 /p)m dp +h d px. substituting x() = x(0) + q() and taking into
2 n 
account the identity h dpi = 0, we can rewrite the second term in  as p 2dx0(0) +h d pq. representing the
rst term in this expression as x0(0)(p /p 2)dp + d(p 2x0(0)), we will have

 x, p = n 
 (n 

 p, we will have  = n 

 dn 

 = zdp +i d pq + complete dierential, where z = x0(0)(p /p 2) + 1
we have constructed new variables in terms of old ones: (x, p)  (z, p, q, p). it is necessary to show that
old variables can be reexpressed in terms of new ones, i.e. this mapping is invertible and we actually consider two
equivalent bases in the phase space. first of all, it is needed to reconstruct variable x(0). considering m , we see
that x(0) enters only in m i0, and other components are expressed completely in terms of new variables:

 /p)m .

 (n 

2 n 

then we are able to obtain the required expression for x(0):

m i0 = xi(0)p 2 +i dq[ip0], m ij =i dq[ipj].

x(0) = z + (p 2)1/2n i

i dq[ip0]  1

2 n i

(n j

/p)m ij.

finally, old variables are reconstructed by relations x() = x(0) + n 

 p().
now we can nd symplectic form  (using antisymmetry of -operation and property d2 = 0):

 q(), p() = n 

 = d = dp  dz +i d p  q,

and inverting its coecient matrix, nd poisson brackets:

variables are restricted by constraints:

{z, p} = g ,

{q(), p()} = g(  ).

(11)

(12)

(13)

q(0) = 0,

g0p 2 i dp() = 0,

qp = 0,

q2 + p2 = 0,

(14)

the rst two constraints have non-zero poisson brackets, proportional to g, and belong to the second class. calcu-
lating new poisson brackets (= diracs brackets on the surface of second class constraints), we obtain expressions (3).

after this procedure the rst two constraints have vanishing poisson brackets (are in involution) with all dynamical
variables4, and as a result, with all constraints. the poisson brackets of derivatives q and momenta p have the
same structure, as those for x
 and p, therefore, the second pair of constraints (14) obeys the same algebra as (2).
finally, the whole set of constraints belong to the rst class.
2.

imposing the gauge q0 = 0 in symplectic form (13), we see that conjugated variable p0 drops out.

it can be

expressed from the fourth constraint in (14) as p0 =p~q 2 + ~p 2. calculating poisson brackets for the obtained form,

we have

{z, p} = g,

{qi(), pj ()} = ij(  ).

the constraints are:

qi(0) = 0,

i dpi() = 0,

~q ~p = 0, p 2 i dp~q 2 + ~p 2 = 0.

(15)

again, the rst two constraints belong the second class. calculation of diracs brackets on their surface gives expres-
sions (5). after that the rst two constraints are in involution with all variables; the third constraint denes the same
closed algebra, as {x()p(), x()p()}; involution of the third and the fourth constraints can be shown in direct
calculation:

qi qj{pi, qj} + pi pj{qi, pj}

{qp,i dpq2 + p2} =i d

= 

d

d i d

q q + pp

pq2 + p2

(  ) +i d

q q + p p

pq2 + p2
pq2 + p2

= i d
(  ) = 

d

q q + pp

pq2 + p2
dpq2 + p2 +

(  )

= 0.

qq + pp

pq2 + p2

thus, the whole set of constraints (15) is of the rst class.
the third constraint generates the following evolution:

q() = {i d  (q p), q()} = ()q()  (0)q(0).

here the rst term corresponds to innitesimal reparametrization q()  q( + ()), and the second one  to a
global translation. because q(0) = 0, this translation keeps q(0) in the origin. variables p are transformed by
reparametrizations correctly  as density:

p() = {i d  (q p), p()} = (()p()),

so that cumulative momentum, contained in interval   [a, b] : pab = r b
pab = ()p()|b

a = pb,b+(b)  pa,a+(a), see g.5.

a dp(s), has correct innitesimal change

lets nd the change of variable xi(0). components m ij are parametrically and translationally invariant, and the
change of x (0) is caused by the second term in (12). the second term is parametrically invariant and is changed in
translation qi  qi  (0)qi(0) by (0)qi(0)n i
x (0) =
(0)qi(0): for xi() = xi(0) + qi() the translation terms are compensated, and it is subjected to pure reparametriza-
tion.

. thus, the innitesimal change of xi(0) equals xi(0) = n i

evolution, generated by hamiltonian h, is described by equations:

qi() = {h, qi()} = pi()/p0()  pi(0)/p0(0),

pi() = {h, pi()} = (qi()/p0()),
4this is guaranteed by a structure of diracs brackets and also evident from denition (3).

p0 pq2 + p2.

its easy to check, that in such evolution p0() is constant in time:
from (12) that xi(0) = pi(0)/p0(0), and reformulate equations in terms of (x, p):

p0() = 0. this fact gives a possibility to nd

xi = pi/p0,

pi = (xi/p0).

simplest way to solve these equations is to introduce a special parametrization on the string:  = (2/p 2)r 

using the fact, that x, p are transformed under reparametrizations as densities, we have:

0 d p0.

where f, g are 2-periodical functions. from the constraints xp = 0, p0 = p 2/2 we also have f 2 = g 2 = p 2/(4)2.
finally, we see that the resolved evolution has period  = p 2.
note: periodicity of string dynamics has been established by many methods. the work [12] gives purely geometrical
explanation of this property.

3. to obtain the expression (7) for lorentz generators, we write:

then, using (11), we rewrite the rst term as

note: mean coordinate z is not lorentz vector, but has more complicated law of transformation [8]. the reason is
that variables n i
, being functions of p only, cannot be lorentz vectors6. however, variables m, composed from
these lorentz non-covariant objects, dene lorentz tensor and generate correct lorentz algebra both on classical and
quantum levels. proof of this fact can be found in [8].

appendix 2: commutators of h with constraints

the rst constraint in (9) is satised identically and commutes with all operators. the second constraint commutes
with operator ~p, dened by (8), and as a result, with each term in expansion (10). lets show that the third
constraint commutes with each term in (10). from the explicit denition of operator ~p its easy to obtain the following
commutation relations:

5the condition p0 = const actually gives rohrlichs gauge [6].

in our case this condition helps to solve the
equations of motion. but being used as a constraint in the phase space, it leads to complicated redenition of poisson
brackets, see the discussion in section 2.

6they should be transformed by a subgroup of lorentz transformations, not changing p, and this contradicts to

the fact, that they are functions of p.
