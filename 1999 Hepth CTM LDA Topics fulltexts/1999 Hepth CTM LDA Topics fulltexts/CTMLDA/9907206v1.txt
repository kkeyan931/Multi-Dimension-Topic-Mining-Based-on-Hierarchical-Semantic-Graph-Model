abstract

we consider n = 2 superconformal theories dened on a 3 + 1 dimensional hyper-
plane intersection of two sets of m5 branes. these theories have (tensionless) bps
string solitons. we use a dual supergravity formulation to deduce some of their
properties via the ads/cft correspondence.

1 introduction

the n = 2 supersymmetry algebra in four dimensions contains a central extension term
that corresponds to string charges in the adjoint representation of the su(2)r part of
the r-symmetry group. this implies that n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories in four
dimensions can have bps string congurations at certain regions in their moduli space
of vacua.
in particular, at certain points in the moduli space of vacua these strings
can become tensionless. a brane conguration that exhibits this phenomena consists of
two sets of m5 branes intersecting on 3 + 1 dimensional hyperplane. the theory on the
intersection is n = 2 supersymmetric. one can stretch m2 branes between the two sets
of m5 branes in a conguration that preserves half of the supersymmetry. this can be
viewed as a bps string of the four dimensional theory. the purpose of this note is to study
such brane congurations using the ads/cft correspondence [1, 2]. such a non-localized
brane system has been discussed in [3], and it does not correpsond to an n = 2 scft. the
fully localized brane system was given a dlcq description as a supersymmetric quantum
mechanics in [4]. this system does lead to an n = 2 scft on the 3 + 1 dimensional
intersection and will be discussed in the paper. most of our detailed analysis will be done
for a semi-localized brane system which corresponds to an n = 2 scft too.

the paper is organized as follows. in the next section we will present the dual su-
pergravity description of the four dimensional theory on the intersection and discuss the
eld theory on the intersection. in section 3 we will use the dual supergravity description
to deduce some properties of these strings. we will argue that from the four dimensional
eld theory viewpoint they are simply bps string congurations on the higgs branch.

2 the supergravity description

we denote the eleven dimensional space-time coordinates by (x||, ~x, ~y, ~z), where x|| parametrize
the (0, 1, 2, 3) coordinates, ~x = (x1, x2) the (4, 5) coordinates, ~y = (y1, y2) the (6, 7) coor-
dinates and ~z = (z1, z2, z3) the (8, 9, 10) coordinates.

consider two sets of vebranes in m theory: n1 coinciding m5 branes and n2 coin-
ciding m5 branes. their worldvolume coordinates are m5 : (x||, ~y) and m5 : (x||, ~x).
such a conguraion preserves eight supercharges. the eleven-dimensional supergravity
background takes the form [5, 6, 7]

f = 3(dh1  dy1  dy2 + dh2  dx1  dx2) ,

(2.2)

where  denes the dual form in the three dimensional space (z1, z2, z3). when the m5
and m5 branes are only localized along the overall transverse directions ~z the harmonic
functions are h1 = 1 + lpn1/2|~z|, h2 = 1 + lpn2/2|~z|, where lp is the eleven dimensional
planck length. the near horizon geometry in this case does not have the ads isometry
group and thus cannot describe a dual scft. moreover, there does not seem to be in this
case a theory on the intersection which decouples from the bulk physics.

consider the semi-localized case when the m5 branes are completely localized while
the m5 branes are only localized along the overall transverse directions 1. when the
branes are at the origin of (~x, ~z) space the harmonic functions in the near core limit of
the m5 branes take the form [8, 9] 2

h1 = 1 +

pn1n2

.

(2.3)

it is useful to make a change of coordinates lpz = (r2 sin 2)/2n2, x = r cos , 0   
/2. in the near-horizon limit we want to keep the energy u = r
xed. this implies, in
l2
p
particular, that membranes stretched between the m5 snd m5 branes in the ~z direction
have nite tension |~z|/l3
p. since we are smearing over the ~y directions we should keep ~y/lp
xed. it is useful to make a change of variables ~y/lp  ~y. the near horizon metric is of
the form of a warped product of ads5 and a six dimensional manifold m6

the metric (2.4) has the ads5 isometry group [10]. therefore, in the spirit of [1], m
theory on the background (2.4), (2.5) should be dual to a four dimensional n = 2 scft.
similar types of metrics appear in the near-horizon limit of the localized d2-d6 [11] and
d4-d8 brane systems [12].

note that the curvature of the metric diverges for small  as

(2.6)

1the supergravity solution with both the m5 branes and the m5 branes being completely localized

has not been constructed yet. we will discuss this system later.

2the numerical factors in (2.3) are determined by the requirment that the integral of f yields the

appropriate charges.

away from  = 0, eleven-dimensional supergravity can be trusted for large n1. the
singularity at  = 0 is interpreted as a signal that some degrees of freedom have been
eectively integrated and are needed in order to resolve the singularity. these presumably
correspond to membranes that end on the m5 branes.

the above m5-m5 brane system can be understood as up lifting to eleven dimensions
of an elliptic brane system of type iia. it consists of n2 ns5-branes with worldvolume
coordinates (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) periodically arranged in the 6-direction and n1 d4-branes with
worldvolume coordinates (0, 1, 2, 3, 6) stretched between them as in gure 1. when we
lift this brane conguration to eleven dimensions, we delocalize in the eleven coordinate
(which in our notation is 7) and since we have delocalization in coordinate 6 as well, we
end up with the semi-localized m5-m5 brane system.

it consists of n2 ns5-branes with worldvolume coordinates
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) periodically arranged in the 6-direction and n1 d4-branes with worldvol-
ume coordinates (0, 1, 2, 3, 6) stretched between them.

the four dimensional theory at low energies on the d4-branes worldvolume is an
su(n1)n2 gauge theory with matter in the bi-fundamentals. the metric (2.4) can be
viewed as providing the eleven-dimensional supergravity description of an m5 brane with
worldvolume r4   [13], where  is the seiberg-witten holomorphic curve (riemann
surface) associated with the four dimensional scft at the origin of the moduli space of
vacua [14]. in this brane set-up the r-symmetry group su(2)r  u(1)r is realized as
the rotation group su(2)8910  u(1)45. the dimensionless gauge coupling of each su(n1)
part of the gauge group is g2

s r2 and it has a dilaton
e = gsn2
r sin 1. this supergravity solution can be trusted when both the curvature
and the dilaton are small. away from  = 0 we need large n2 and n2  n 1/3
. when
the latter condition is not satised the dilaton is large and we should consider the eleven-
dimensional description.

(2.10)

the case when both sets of m5 branes are fully localized corresponds to a non elliptic
model [14].
in the type iia picture the coordinate 6 is not periodic and we have n2
ns5-branes and n1 d4 branes as in gure 2. there is no bending of this conguration
[13] and this allows a full localization in the coordinates 6 and 7. the four-dimensional
theory is an su(n1)n21 gauge theory with matter in the bi-fundamental representations
of su(n1)isu(n1)i+1, i = 1, ..., n21 as well as n1 hypermultiplets in the fundamental
representation of su(n1)1 and n1 hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation of
su(n1)n21. when n2 = 2 it is su(n1) gauge theory with 2n1 hypermultiplets in the
fundamental representation. although there does not exist yet a supergravity solution
when both sets of m5 branes are fully localized we expect the discussion in the next
section of bps strings to be similar.

branes are fully localized.

with z a
a = 0. the su(2)r part of the r-symmetry group acts on the indices a, b.
in addition to the particle charge z [ab], there are in (3.1) the string charges z a
b in the
adjoint representation of su(2)r and the membrane charges z (ab)
in the 2-fold symmetric
representation of su(2)r. thus, n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions
can have bps strings and bps domain walls in addition to the well studied bps particles.



the bps particles and bps strings are realized by stretching m2 brane between the
m5 and m5 branes. when the membrane worldvolume coordinates are (0, x, y) where x
is one of the ~x components and y is one of the ~y components we get a bps particle of the
four dimensional theory. it is charged under u(1)r that acts on ~x and is a singlet under
su(2)r that acts on ~z. the bps particles exist on the coulomb branch of the gauge
theory on which u(1)r acts, as in gure 3, and their mass is given by the seiberg-witten
solution.

when the membrane worldvolume coordinates are (0, 1, z) where z is one of the ~z
components we get a bps string of the four dimensional theory. it is not charged under
u(1)r and it transforms in the adjoint su(2)r since ~z transforms in this representation.
the bps strings exist on the higgs branch of the gauge theory on which su(2)r acts, as
in gure 3. the tension of the bps string is given by |~z|
where |~z| is the distance between
l3
p
the m5 and m5 branes and it is nite in the eld theory limit. it is easy to see that we do
not have in this set-up bps domain walls since stretching a membrane with worldvolume
coordinates (0, 1, 2) breaks the supersymmetry completely. one expects bps domain wall
congurations when the moduli space of vacua has disconnected components.

in the type iia picture the bps string is constructed by stretching a d2 brane between
the d4 branes and ns5-brane. the seperation between these two types of branes in the

5

~z direction has two interpretations depending on whether the four dimensional gauge
group has a u(1) part or not [16]. if is does then the separation is interpreted as the
su(2)r triplet fi parameters ~. the bps string tension is proportional to |~|. if the
gauge group does not have a u(1) part the seperation between these two types of branes
in the ~z direction is interpreted as giving a vev to an su(2)r triplet component of the
meson qq which transforms under su(2)r as 2  2 = 3  1. the bps string tension is
proportional to this vacuum expectation value. at the origin of the moduli space, where
we have scft, the string becomes tensionless.

figure 3: there are bps particles on the coulomb branch and bps strings on the higgs
branch. the scft is at the intersection of these two branches.

we can use the ads/cft correspondence in order to compute the self energy of a
string and a potential between two such strings of opposite orientation [17]. this is
obtained, in the supergravity approximation, by a minimization of the m2 brane action

s =

(3.2)

in the background (2.4), (2.5). consider a static conguration x0 = , x1 =  and
xi = xi(). then, the energy per unit length of the string is given by

thus, the string self-energy

(3.3)

(3.4)

the function e parametrizes the dependence of the self-energy on the coordinate .
from the eld theory point of view, this parametrizes a dependence on the moduli that
parametrize the space of vacua. x|| is a cut-o. in (3.4) we used the holographic relation
between a distance x|| in eld theory and the coordinate u which in our case reads3

x|| 

(n2n1)1/2

u

.

(3.5)

similarly, the potential energy per units length between two strings of opposite orien-

tation seperated by distance l is

e  

n1
l2 .

(3.6)

here l is distance between two strings. the results (3.4),(3.6) do not depend on n2
which means that they do not depend on the gauge coupling of the four dimensional
eld theory g2
y m  n2. this is not unexpected. the gauge coupling can be viewed as a
vacuum expectation value of a scalar in the vector multiplet and does not appear in the
hypermultiplet metric. since the bps strings exist on the higgs branch it is natural that
their potential and self-energy do not depend on the gauge coupling. however, (3.4) and
(3.6) are only the large n1 results and will presumably have 1/n1 corrections.

as noted above, the theory on the intersection of two sets of m5 branes containes bps
particles, which arise from m2 branes stretched in the directions (0, x, y). minimization
of the m2 brane action in this case yields the potential between these two such objects of
opposite charge separated by distance l

the 11-dimentional supergravity action goes like

suggesting that the number of freedom goes like n 2

two-point function of the stress energy tensor. this is, of course, expected for su(n1)n2
gauge theory. the one loop correction has the following form l9

is suppressed by n 2

a 1/n1 expansion, which again is in agreement with the eld theory expectation.

the type iia background (2.10) is t-dual to type iib on ads5  s5/zn2 [14]. the
latter is the dual description of the zn2 orbifold of n = 4 theory [19]. for instance
the number of degrees of freedom can be understood as c(n = 4)/n2  n 2
1 n2. we
can identify the spectrum of chiral primary operators with the supergravity kaluza-klein
excitations as analysed in [20, 21].

the matrix description of intersecting m5 branes [4] describes the system where both
sets of m5 branes are completely localized. the (tensionless) strings studied there are
the bps strings on the higgs branch of the gauge theory which become tensionless at the
origin of the moduli space of vacua. for instance, the case n1 = n2 = 1, corresponds
to n = 2 u(1) gauge theory with two electrons. the dimension two operator, identied
with a compact cohomology localized at the origin in [4], corresponds to t r2 where  is
the adjoint chiral supereld. in particular, there seems to be nothing novel about these
scfts.
