abstract
we test the renormalization of wilson operators and the mandelstam- leibbrandt gauge
in the case when the sides of the loop are parallel to the n, n vectors used in the m-l
gauge. graphs which in the feynman gauge are free of ultra-violet divergences, in the m-l
gauge show double divergences and single divergences with non-local si and ci functions.
these non-local functions cancel out when we add all graphs together and the constraints
of gauge invariance are satised. in appendix c we briey discuss the problems of the
m-l gauge for loops containing spacelike lines.

1. introduction.
the aim of this research is to test the mandelstam-leibbrandt gauge, which is the best
form of the lightcone gauge with the condition n  a = 0, n2 = 0 (where n is a vector used
to dene the gauge).

the wilson operator is dened as

w = t rp exp(igzc

a  dx)

(1)

where c is a closed curve, p denotes operator and matrix ordering along c, and the non-
abelian gauge eld a is a matrix in some representation r of the gauge group g. the
path-ordered phase factors (1) are gauge-invariant objects and therefore an ideal laboratory
for testing dierent gauges. also they are better coordinates in a non-abelian theory than
are the conventional vector gauge eld matrices a(x), even though they are functions
of all closed paths. the gauge-variant gauge elds greatly overdescribe the observable
dynamics. the operators (1) are in contrast gauge-invariant, more precisely describe the
dynamics and satisfy gauge-invariant equations. the hope has therefore arisen that the
w s can replace the as as fundamental dynamical variables, and correspondingly that
the loop functions (wilson operators) can replace the greens functions.

however, the loop functions are perturbatively even more divergent than the greens
functions [1]. therefore, to make any sense out of the above program, one must renor-
malize. this has already been done in lorentz gauges [2], [3]. in this paper we discuss
the renormalization of wilson operators in the mandelstam-leibbrandt light-cone gauge
which became popular with the revival and intensive research of string theories. the com-
plexity of the explicit calculations of individual graphs to order g4 speaks about usefulness
of the light-cone gauge in perturbative qcd for itself. apart from that, in appendix c,
we explain why strict application of dimensional regularization in the light-cone gauge is
not possible in the case of spacelike and/or timelike lines.

it was noted [1] that if the wilson loop contains a straight light-like segment, charge
renormalization does not work in a simple graph-by-graph way, but does work when certain
graphs are added together. in the m-l gauge renormalization is even more complicated.
we shall show to order g4 in perturbation theory that w in the m-l gauge obeys multi-
plicative renormalizability required in [1],

wr(ar; gr) = z()wb(ab; gb, )

(2)

where suces r and b denote renormalized and bare quantities and dimensional regular-
ization with d = 4   is used. the relationship between gb and gr and between ar and
ab should be the same as in ordinary perturbation theory. z() is determined from the
vacuum expectation value hw i

hwr(gr)i = z()hwb(gb, )i.

(3)

however, the divergences of the individual graphs are not of the short distance nature
and are non-local on the curve c. they are grouped into four tensors n
n
and nn. there are no transverse divergences of the type e.g. np, pp, (we use the
decomposition of the momentum p = 1
2 np + p), neither g divergences, as
argued in appendix a.

p+ + 1

, nn

, n

2 n

n

let the divergent part of the amplitude for the emission of two real gluons in momen-

tum space be

m = ann + bnn

 + cn

n + dn

n
,

where m is the coecient of the two elds when we expand w in terms of the elds and
n and n are the lightlike vectors used to dene the gluon propagator in the m-l gauge

g = (k2 + i){g +

nk + nk
n  k + in  k

}.

the polarization vectors should satisfy

and can be chosen to satisfy

e.g.

p  e = 0, q  f = 0

n  e = n  f = 0,

e =

p+n

  pn  2p
|4p+p|1/2

, f =

q+n

  qn  2q
|4q+q|1/2

(4)

(5)

for p and q on shell respectively. the other independent polarization vector which is
perpendicular to p , n and n and counterpart to e, gives zero when contracted into m
and so plays no role in this paper. of course, there is a counterpart of f as well.

we have four identities following from gauge invariance, which the amplitude should

satisfy.
(a) m ef should be the same as feynman gauge when the external momenta p

and q are on shell,
(b) m eq = 0 for p on shell,
m pf = 0 for q on shell,

(c) m pq = 0.
these equations allow us to redene the vectors (5) into

e
 = pn  p+n

, f 

 = qn  q+n
,

and the tensor structure (4) which satises (b) and (c) can be written in the form

m = e

f 

m.

3

(6)

(7)

the form (7) will in section 5 be crucial to show that non-local divergences must cancel.
(a), (b) and (c) impose the constraint on (4)

p+q+a + p+qb  pq+c  pqd = 0,

p+q+a  p+qb + q+pc  pqd = 0,

p+q+a + p+qb + pq+c + pqd = 0,

i.e.

q+a + qb = 0,

(8)

(15), (22) and
and x all the ratios of a : b : c : d. the answers we nd in eqs.
(32) conrm this prediction and are invariant under n > cn, n > cn, p+ > cp+,
p > cp for any constant c.

a, b, c and d turn out to be local, although from the example of the self-energy
graph [4], one might have expected non-local divergences to occurr with the wilson loop.
if we take a self-energy part and try to derive an on-shell physical thing, we get zero
(we take s(p), put p2 = 0, multiply by ee where e is a polarization vector satisfying
p  e = 0). therefore we cannot deduce much by arguing that physical things are gauge
invariant - we get just 0 = 0. but, for the wilson loop, we do not get zero if we put
p2 = q2 = 0 and multiply by polarization vectors. so the gauge-independence argument
does give some information. as the feynman gauge non-local divergences cancel [1], (a),
(b) and (c) explain why there are no non-local divergences in the m-l wilson operator.

the abelian crcr part obeys the factorization theorem [5], [6]. therefore in this
work we shall concentrate only on the non-abelian cgcr part of the graphs, where cr
and cg are the casimirs for the representation used to dene the wilson loop and the
gluons. in the following sections we list nal results for the amplitude m to order g4 after
the decomposition in (4). the graphs are grouped into sets according to their topological
equivalence.

where b(nn) denotes the born term which is in the nn sector only. the non-local

eld renormalization matrix in the lightcone gauge mixes all three sectors.

g1-set of graphs are the graphs with one 3-gluon vertex. there are two groups of

of course the graphs with p and q interchanged must be added. the graphs in fig.8 give

{2(eipl  1) + (eipl  1)ci(pl) + i(eipl + 1)si(pl)}.

5. discussion
we are now going to explain how (2) works out to order g4. the eld renormalization
matrix in the m-l gauge is [8],[9],[10],in momentum space, where a(p) is the gluon eld
in momentum space

ab

 (p) = (1 +

11
6

c)[g  cn(n

 

n  p

n  p + in  p

n)]ar(p)

where

= zar(p)

c =

g2
r
82

cg

and coupling constant renormalization is

gb = (1 

11
6

c)gr.

(33)

on the right hand side (2) contains various sorts of fourth order terms.

(a) wb to fourth order, z, z and gb to zeroth order
(b) wb to second order, z to second order
(c) wb to second, gb to second
(d) wb to second, z to second

then (b) contributes only to the abelian crcr part, while (c) and (d) should give
the counter-terms needed to cancel the uv divergences we found in (a). of course, since
wb to second order has two real gluons, that is two ab operators, it gets two z factors,
one depending on p and the other on q. we list counter-terms for each sector separately.

(1) nn sector

although the born term is contained in the nn sector only, we had to study the
o-shell sectors as well. the reason is the eld renormalization matrix z which mixes all
three sectors. the born term to order g2 is

b(nn) =

1

b(p)a

where

h = t r(tbtd)(eit p+  1)(eit q+  1)(eilp  1)(eilq  1).

we notice that the factor 11
6 c cancels out between the wave function renormalization (two
rst terms) and the coupling constant renormalization (last term). hence, the counter-term
to order g4

(3) nn sector gives zero

the sum of (1) and (2) gives exactly the counter-terms needed to cancel (15), (22) and
(32). the complications with non-local si and ci divergences were caused by the choice
of the m-l gauge, not the lightlike sides of the wilson loop, as shown in appendix c. we
certainly expected (a) of eq.(6) to be gauge-invariant, but in fact we nd that the whole
of the divergent part of m is gauge invariant.

we shall now explain how the eld renormalization matrix z leaves this tensor

structure unchanged. let us envoke the tensor structure for the amplitude in eq.(7)

m = e

f 

m.

13

(38)

this vanishes when contracted with p or q. then it is easy to see why z does not
change the structure. the non-local structure in z contains

n(n

 

n  p
n  p

n) = 

ne

p+

.

(39)

when contracted with m the term ne
p+

= 2 becomes free of non-localities.

although we have demonstrated multiplicative renormalizability of wilson operators
to order g4 in the m-l gauge, the complexity of the actual calculation raises the question
of usefulness of both, lightcone gauge and wilson operators as fundamental variables in
perturbative qcd. lightcone gauge has additional problems for loops containing spacelike
and/or timelike lines as explained in appendix c.

appendix a
there are no transverse components in the wilson operator as we have assumed in (4).
let us take one of the characteristic integrals which appears in the graph with one 3-gluon
vertex in fig.7.

z = z dnk

(eit (pk)+  eit k+ )

2k

k2(p  k)2k+



1

(p  k)

(eikl  1)(1  ei(pk) l) = p  m

(a1)

we multiply both sides by the perpendicular momentum p, and write

2p  k = k 2  k+k  (p  k)2 + (p  k)+(p  k) + p+k + pk+

(a2)

z  p = p 2  m = z dnk
{eit p+ (eit k+  1)  (eit k+  1) + (eit p+  1)}

(p  k)2  k2 + pk+ + p+k

k2(p  k)2k+



1

(p  k)

{eipl(ei(pk)l  1) + ei(pk) l  1}

(a3)

in this form we can integrate each of the terms in (a3). k+p gives uv nite term

as the integrals of the type

i = z dnk

1

k2(p  k)2

eit k+

1

(p  k)

contain the oscillating factor eit k+ which suppresses the possible uv divergences. let us
denote by y the contribution from kp+.

y = z dnk

p+k

k2(p  k)2k+

 {eit p+ (eit k+  1)  (eit k+  1) + (eit p+  1)}



1

(p  k)

{eipl(ei(pk)l  1) + ei(pk) l  1}

(a5)

the factor (eit p+  1) gives only uv nite term. also we can write

k

(p  k)

=

(k  p) + p

(p  k)

= 1

(a6)

modulo uv nite terms. we change the variable pk = k and use the argument analogous
to (a4) but now with k+ and k interchanged. the integral

a = z dnk

1

k2(p  k)2

eikl

1

(p  k)+

(ei(pk)+t  1)

(a7)

is uv nite due to the oscillating factor eikl.

therefore the uv divergent part of y is

y = p+(eipl + 1)z dnk

1

k2(p  k)2(p  k)+

{eit p+ (eit (pk)+  1)  (eit (pk)+  1)}.

(a8)

after the integration over k using the formula

z dnk

where

we obtain

1

k2(p  k)2 = i2

(a10)

the remaining two integrals in (a3) we denote by e and f .

e = z dnk

(p  k)

{ei(pk) l  1 + eipl(ei(pk)l  1)}.

(a11)

the term (eit p+  1) gives vanishing contribution upon the integration in the complex
k+ plane as

z dnk

f (p, k) = 0

(a12)

1

k2k+

because both poles lie in the same half-plane with k+ regulated in the sense of mandelstam
[7]. other terms have no pole at k+ = 0. for the rst (eit k+ 1) we close the contour in the
upper half-plane and pick up a pole at k+ = k 2
(k), while for the second (eit k+ 1)
we close the contour in the lower half-plane and pick up a pole at k+ = k 2

(k).

f (k, p) = 0.

(a14)

this step is not permitted for the spacelike or timelike lines (we explain why in appendix

in the case of wilson loops with spacelike and/or timelike lines strict application of di-
mensional regularization is not possible. as an example let us take the self-energy type

naively, one would strictly apply the rules of dimensional regularization and set the second
integral to zero as a tadpole in the perpendicular momentum k. however, after the
introduction of polar coordinates

k3 = k cos  = kx,

d3k = k2dk(1  x2) 

2 dxz d,

z d =

2

21 
(1  
2 )

(c5)

and integration over k, the rst integral leads to an integral which is not dened for any .

therefore we have to keep  in the integrand and it becomes a part of the gauge.
we can choose two ways. either we evaluate integrals separately in terms of the spurious,
ambiguous terms of the form  

2 2 dictated by the tadpole

w t = z d2k

or we transform the tadpole into polar coordinates

w t = z

dx(1  x2) 

2

1

(c7)

and sum it up with the rst integral in (c4) leading to

w1 = ieip3lp1

(c8)

we notice how crucial the contribution from the tadpole 

1x2+4ix2 is for the reg-
ularization of the pole at x = 1. only after the addition of the tadpole we can set  = 0
in (c8) and evaluate the integrals in the strip 1 <  < 4. in the same way we evaluate the
second part of (c1) with

denominator.

1

4x

(p+k)3

 let us mention that the change of variable k3 into k3 in the second part of (c1) is

not permitted as it creates the pole in k3.

20

thus we obtain the result for (c1)

(c9)

this graph in the feynman gauge contains only simple single poles. hence, the funny
non-local sine and cosine divergences and the double pole are caused by the choice of the
m-l gauge, not the lightlike sides of the loop.
