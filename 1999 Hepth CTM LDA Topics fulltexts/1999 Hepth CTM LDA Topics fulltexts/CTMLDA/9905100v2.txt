abstract

we study dynamical gauge symmetry breaking via compactied space in the frame-
work of su(n) gauge theory in m d1  s1 (d = 4, 5, 6) space-time. in particular, we
study in detail the gauge symmetry breaking in su(2) and su(3) gauge theories when
the models contain both fundamental and adjoint matter. as a result, we nd that

any pattern of gauge symmetry breaking can be realized by selecting an appropriate
set of numbers (nf, nad) in these cases. this is achieved without tuning boundary
conditions of the matter elds. as a by-product, in some cases we obtain an eec-
tive potential which has no curvature at the minimum, thus leading to massless higgs
scalars, irrespective of the size of the compactied space.

introduction

1.1. the gauge hierarchy problem and higher-dimensional gauge theories

we have proposed a possibility of solving the gauge hierarchy problem 1) by invoking

higher-dimensional gauge symmetry.

our main idea in this scenario is the following. suppose we consider a gauge theory on
the d-dimensional manifold m minkow  m extra, where m minkow is an ordinary minkowskian
4-dimensional space-time, and m extra is a compactied spatial (d  4)-dimensional manifold.
the gauge elds am on m minkow  m extra have 4 + (d  4) components:

a( = 0,    , 3), am(m = 4,    , d  1).

(1)

if we regard zero-modes of d  4 components of gauge elds as higgs scalars, we can avoid

quadratically divergent quantum corrections of higgs boson masses thanks to the higher-
dimensional gauge symmetry.

in a previous work, 1) we considered a qed model on m d1  s1 space-time and took
a zero-mode of d-th the component of the gauge eld as a higgs scalar. we calculated
also the quantum mass correction of the d-th component of the gauge eld. as a result we

conrmed the disappearance of the quadratic divergence. we, however, have found that a
nite mass correction to the higgs remains, which is generally proportional to the inverse
of the s1 radius.

although the gauge hierarchy problem in its original sense has been solved, as the

quadratic divergence has disappeared, several issues have to be settled for the scenario to
be realistic. here we address the following two important issues. (i) in our toy model on
m 4  s1, the higgs mass mh experiences a nite but generally large quantum correction
provided that the radius of s1 is as small as the gut or planck length. 1) then the issue is
how we can make the nite correction to mh small, approximately comparable to the weak
scale. (ii) the toy model on m 4  s1 is higher dimensional qed. the u(1) gauge symmetry,
therefore, is not spontaneously broken, even though the higgs d-th component of the photon

eld has non-vanishing vacuum expectation value (vev). this is simply because the higgs
eld is electrically neutral, and there appears the possibility to break the gauge symmetry,
once the theory is extended to the non-abelian gauge (yang-mills) theory, where the higgs

behaves as an adjoint representation of gauge group.

with regard to the rst issue above, we have already discussed a few possibilities to
settle the problem in a previous work. 1) the rst rather trivial possibility is to assume a
large compactication scale such as tev1. 2) 3) it is interesting to note that such a large
scale compactication has attracted revived interest, partially inspired by the progress in

2

superstring/m theories. 4) the second possibility is to utilize a heavy electron where mass
m satises ml  1 (l: circumference of s1). then the correction to mh is suppressed
roughly as exp(ml)/l. (here exp(ml) corresponds to the boltzmann factor in nite
temperature eld theory.)
it has also been pointed out that the nite mass mh can be
regarded as coming from a sort of aharonov-bohm eect on s1 space and may disappear if
the compactied space is a simply-connected manifold. we have conrmed this expectation
in a toy model on s2, showing that mh identically vanishes.

the main purpose of this paper is to settle the remaining second issue mentioned above.
in theories with s1 as the extra space, the constant background and vev of gauge elds have
physical meaning as a wilson loop, and they can be dynamically xed by the minimization
of eective potential as functions of the background elds. thus in yang-mills theories the
vev behave just as the vev of adjoint higgs, and they generally break the gauge symmetry
spontaneously: the so-called hosotani mechanism. 5)

to obtain realistic gut-type theories, starting from higher-dimensional yang-mills the-

ories, it is quite important to study how the gauge symmetry is dynamically broken by the
hosotani mechanism. in particular, we are interested in the question of how the breaking

pattern of gauge symmetry depends on the choice of the representation (fundamental or
adjoint or   ) of matter elds. we will extensively study this point by considering two
representative gauge groups, su(2) and su(3). as a bonus we also nd an interesting

property of the theory, concerning the rst issue mentioned above. namely, we realize in
some cases that the curvature of the curve of the potential function identically vanishes,
leading to mh = 0.
it should be noted that this vanishing mh is obtained for arbitrary
compactication scale and without the introduction of a simply-connected space like s2. 1)

1.2. gauge symmetry breaking and matter representation in hosotani mechanism

we now briey review the history of the investigation of the gauge symmetry breaking via
the hosotani mechanism, and in particular the case of m d1  s1 space-time conguration.
in 1983, hosotani found that a gauge symmetry may break down in a system of su(n)
gauge theories on m 3s1 space-time. but in his model in order to break the gauge symmetry,
it was necessary to have both many (more than 16 avors) complex scalar elds as the matter
eld and a non-trivial boundary conditions for the matter elds,  = /2. 5) later it became
obvious that for the case in which fermions belong to the fundamental representation of the
su(n) gauge group, gauge symmetry is never broken. in 1989, it was found that su(2)
gauge symmetry breaking is possible when fermions are in an adjoint representation, 6) 7) and
it was shown that the pattern of gauge symmetry breaking depends on the congruency class
representation of the gauge group. 7) 8)

3

many works have been done along this direction, giving hope for using the hosotani
mechanism as a possible mechanism of gut symmetry breaking. this scenario has been
investigated to some extent. 9) 10) however, the case in which the theory contains both fun-
damental and adjoint representations of fermions has never been investigated, except the
e6 model in ref. 7) and supersymmetric models. 12) 13) i was partially motivated by these
works in supersymmetric models and attempt to study the non-supersymmetric version of
gauge symmetry breaking via the hosotani mechanism in theories with both fundamental

and adjoint matter.

2. dynamical gauge symmetry breaking through extra dimension

2.1. eective potential

we consider su(n) gauge theories in m d1  s1 space-time with both fundamental and

adjoint fermionic elds.

the lagrangian is given by

dm f = m f + igt aaa
dm ad = m ad + ig[t aaa

m f,

m , ad],

am = aa

m t a,

(3)

(4)

(5)

f(ad) are fermions in the fundamental (adjoint) representation, and nf (nad) are the avor
numbers of the dirac fermion in the fundamental (adjoint) representation. the indices m

and n run from 0 to d  1 (whereas  and  run from 0 to d  2) and j and k are avor
indices. the color index has been omitted here. we use x and y as the coordinates on m d1
and s1, respectively.

the boundary conditions on s1 are taken as

a(x, y + l) = a(x, y),
f (x, y + l) = eif f(x, y),
ad(x, y + l) = eiadad(x, y),

(6)

(7)

(8)

where l is the compactication scale of the s1 subspace and is related to the radius of s1
as l = 2r.

(13)

the i are called the non-integrable phases of the gauge eld 9) and cannot be constrained by
the pure-gauge condition fm n  0. they should be determined dynamically at the quantum
level as a result of the minimization of ve.

when non-zero i are induced dynamically, only generators of the gauge group, which

commute with the wilson line surrounding s1,

form a remaining subgroup of su(n), and other symmetries are broken. thus gauge sym-

metry breaking is induced through dynamics in the extra dimension.

the phases f and ad, relevant for the fermions boundary conditions, remain as non-
dynamical parameters of the model and must be set by hand. in the nad 6= 0 and nf = 0
cases, 9) 10) the gauge symmetry breaking is controlled by changing the boundary condition
ads.
in this paper, however, we show that we can also realize various patterns of gauge
symmetry breaking by varying the appropriate choice of nf and nad, even if we simply take
the periodic boundary condition of fermions,

f = ad = 0.

(15)

when the periodic boundary condition is taken for fermions, ve is simplied as

ve =

it can also be written in terms of the polylogarithmic functions lid(x)  p

n=1

(17)

xn
nd :



exp(in)

= re lid(exp(i)).

(18)

fd() = re

xn=1

nd

thus we can calculate fd() analytically for some special values, or even numerically with
arbitrary precision.

it is easy to show how each sector of the eective potential plays a role in the gauge
symmetry breaking. the combination of gauge and fundamental fermion sectors has global

minima in a symmetric conguration of , where hw i is su(n) gauge symmetric. on the
other hand, the adjoint fermion sector has global minima at another , where hw i allows
only u(1)n symmetry. thus we can expect that by changing nf and nad we get a variety
of gauge symmetry breaking.

some comments are now in order.

2.1.1. eects of scalar eld

it is obvious that if there are also some scalars in the theory, the cotribution of the
f,ad avor complex scalar elds to the eective potential is given by replacing 2[d/2]nf,ad

f,ad . thus, nf and nad in eqs. (11) and (12) should be understood as

n scalar

where r stands for the representation and n fermion
are the number of avors of
fermions and scalars in the representation r, respectively. therefore nf and nad can be
negative and even take rational number values.

our investigation can be applied to any region of (nf, nad) plane. the nad < (d2)/2[d/2]
region is investigated without loss of generality by investigating the nad = 0 case and has
been already investigated by many authors. the region dened by nad > (d  2)/2[d/2]
and nf = 0 has also been investigated, 6) 7) 8) 9) 10) and it has been claimed that the gauge
symmetry breaking is mainly handled by the boundary conditions of fermion elds. 9) 10) but
the region dened by nad > (d  2)/2[d/2] and nf 6= 0 has not yet been investigated. hence
we study what happens if both adjoint and fundamental matter are included in the hosotani

mechanism.

2.1.2. supersymmetry

if majorana, weyl or majorana-weyl fermions exist in d-dimensional space-time and
if we take such a type of fermion as the matter eld, instead of the dirac fermion, nr
should be replaced by 1
, respectively. it also must be
pointed out that if the specic relations 2[d/2]nad  (d  2) = 0 and nf = 0 hold, and all
nad matter elds are fermionic, the fermionic elds can be regarded as gaugino, and the
system may be regarded as a super yang-mills theory. for supersymmetric pure yang-mills

theories, however, the eective potentials calculated in this article all vanish and will not be
investigated further. when the boundary conditions of bosons and fermions are dierent,
this is not the case, and symmetry breaking results even if nad = (d  2)/2[d/2] and nf = 0.
this is related to the scherk-schwartz mechanism of supersymmetry breaking, 11) 12) 13) and
we will present the results of an investigation along this line in the near future.

2.2. su(2) case

in the su(2) case, the parameterization of background gauge elds is given as

hayigl = diag(, ).

(20)

the su(2) symmetric gauge conguration corresponds to hayigl = diag(, ) or diag(0, 0).
hence, when ve() has a minimum at  =  or  = 0, the su(2) symmetry remains dy-
namically.

we search for global minima of v () for various nf and nad with periodic boundary
conditions (f = ad = 0). to see the contribution of each sector, v g+gh
e are
plotted in figs.1(a),(b) and (c), respectively. in these gures, we nd that the points  = 0
and  always become global minima of v g+gh
e has global
minima at  = /2 and 3/2, at which the su(2) symmetry is broken. thus to judge

e. on the other hand, v ad

whether there appears another local minimum to break su(2) that is lower than those at
 = 0 and , it is useful to calculate the second derivative of ve at  = 0 and . if su(2)
starts to break at some number of nf and nad, the second derivative at  = 0 or  is expected
to vanish for such a pair of numbers. for the specic case of d = 4, the calculated second

derivatives are found to behave as

 nf  8nad + 4,

(22)

(23)

it is quite interesting to note the fact that when equality is satised in (23), not only
is su(2) symmetry restored, but also the second derivative of gauge potential is exactly

0, which means that the higgs scalar, as an extra gauge boson, has a vanishing mass for
arbitrary l, even in the model on s1.

2.2.1. d = 5, d = 6 case

using f 

5 (0) = f 

6 (2n) = (4) =
6 () = 74/720, where () is riemans zeta function, we can also determine the

4/90,f

we thus have found that in both cases, gauge symmetry breaking and its restoration

occur, though the critical values of (nf, nad) are dierent.

2.3. su(3) case

we take the parameterization of the background su(3) gauge eld as )

hayigl = diag(1, 2, (1 + 2)).

the case in which su(3) is exact and not broken is realized for

hayigl = diag(0, 0, 0),

hayigl = diag(2/3, 2/3, 4/3) and its permutations.

the symmetry breaking of su(3) into su(2)  u(1) is realized provided

hayigl = diag(0, , ) and its permutations,

or generally,

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

hayigl = diag(, , 2) ( 6= 2 mod 2) and its permutations.

(30)

the contribution of each sector to ve is shown in fig. 2. we can see that v g+gh

e does
not have a minima at 1 = 2 = 0 for suciently large nf, and ve has global minima at points
such as (1, 2) = (2/3, 2/3), as pointed out by hosotani. 5) the points (1, 2) = (0, 0)
and (2/3, 2/3) are all su(3) symmetric. on the other hand, v ad
e has minima at other
points, for example at (1, 2) = (0, 2/3), where su(3) symmetry is broken.

e +v f

our main interest here is whether the breaking su(3)  su(2)  u(1) is possible. such
a study will be helpful when we apply the method to more realistic gut theories, where
partial breaking like su(5)  su(3)  su(2)  u(1) is favored. when nad = 1 and nf = 3,
ve seems to have a minimum at (1, 2, (1 + 2)) = (0, , ) and its permutations (fig.
3).

) we can also use another parameterization such as haigl = 13 + 28, where the i are gell-manns

 matrices. but the following discussion does not depend on the choice of parameterization.

and its eigenvalues and eigenvectors is useful. by utilizing such a method, we study how the
gauge symmetry breaks by changing nf with nad = 1 for brevity.

(1) 0  nf < 3

for nf = 0, the minima of the potential coincides with those of v ad
such minima move to the points where su(2)  u(1) symmetry is realized.

e . as nf increases,

(2) 3  nf < 9

when nf = 3, global minima are at the points (0, , ) (and its permutations). it
also should be noted that the hessian of ve exactly vanishes at such points:

det hve (0, ; nad = 1, nf = 3)  (6nad  3  nf)2|nad=1,nf =3 = 0.

(32)

this means that the mass of the adjoint higgs as a curvature of the eective potential
vanishes exactly. then as nf
increases, global minima of ve leave from su(2) 
u(1) symmetric points ((0, 0), (0, ), (, 0)) and move to the su(3) symmetric points

(2/3, 2/3), keeping su(2)  u(1) symmetry.

(3) 9  nf

when nf  9, global minima are at su(3) symmetric (non-trivial) points, such as
(2/3, 2/3).

(4) negative nf

as nf decreases, the global minima move to the trivial vev, such as (0, 0). when
nf  3, su(3) symmetry is recovered.

2.3.1. summary

(33)

hence all possible symmetry breaking patterns turn out to be realized.

it is interesting to note that in the case nf = 6nad 3, not only does the wilson line allow
su(2)  u(1) symmetry, but also all components of the hessian at su(2)  u(1) symmetric

points vanish. this means that by the hosotani mechanism, su(3) symmetry breaks into

11

su(2)u(1), and at this minimum, the eective potential has a vanishing second derivative,
which again suggests that the bosons remain massless.

we must remark that we get such a massless state without any ne-tuning of the param-
eters because the equality nf  6nad + 3 = 0 is exactly satised without any ne-tuning of
parameters, as both nad and nf are discrete numbers.

2.3.2. d = 5, d = 6 cases

as pointed out for the su(2) model, the situation of symmetry breaking depends also

on the dimensionality of space-time.

dependences on the matter content is more complicated for d = 5 and d = 6 case. for
example, in the d = 5 case, det hve (2/3, 2/3) > 0 suggests that (2/3, 2/3) is at least a
local minimum of ve. however, for nf = (108nad  81)/8, as shown in fig. 4, such a point
is not the global minimum. su(3) symmetry is recovered for suciently large nf, though

the critical value at which su(3) symmetry is recovered is more ambiguous than in the d = 4
case. we see that su(3) is recovered at least when nf > 4 for nad = 1 case.

the critical value at which su(2)  u(1) is enlarged to su(3) is ambiguous, as in the case
of d = 5. the transition u(1)2  su(2)  u(1) occurs at (18nad  9)/7 = nf, and su(3)
symmetry is recovered at least at nf = 8.

it also must be pointed out that in the d = 5 and 6 cases, the curvatures at su(2)  u(1)

symmetric points never vanish, unlike in the d = 4 case.

2.4. fd()  cos  (f2c) approximation

we found that gauge symmetry breaking depends not only on the matter content of
the theory but also on the dimensionalities of the space-time. this is partially because the
factors 2[2/d] and (d  2) depend on the dimensionality d. the other reason is that the form

12

of the function fd() depends on d. generally, fd() becomes close to cos  as d becomes
large. thus we can approximate fd() by cos  for suciently large d.

by taking fd()  cos  (f2c, for short) as an approximation, we can more easily

calculate and evaluate the ve for the case of su(3) with d = 10.

comparing the values of ve(2/3, 2/3) and ve(, ), because minima of ve cannot be
realized except at these points for (4nad  1)/2 < nf < 16nad  4 in this approximation.

3. discussion

in this paper, it has been shown that in the hosotani mechanism, the breaking pattern

of gauge symmetry depends on the choice of the representation of matter elds. the manner
in which the matter in the fundamental and adjoint representations contribute to the gauge

symmetry breaking has been clearly shown in the su(2) case.

by explicit calculation we have also shown for the su(3) model that we can realize not

only breaking of su(3) gauge symmetry but also breaking into su(2)  u(1), i.e., partial
gauge symmetry breaking, by suitably selecting the combination of nf and nad. this feature
may be very desirable in constructing more realistic gut models where a breaking into a
subsymmetry with the same rank, such as su(5)  su(3)  su(2)  u(1), is needed.
ho and hosotanis model 10) contains only an adjoint matter eld, and the su(n) gauge
group breaks only into u(1)n 1 with periodic boundary conditions, and nontrivial boundary
conditions were required for su(5) to break into su(3)  su(2)  u(1).

including the desirable feature mentioned just above, our model has the following advan-

tages, when considered as a prototype model of gut.

1. our model contains fermions with the fundamental representation in addition to the ad-

joint representation, while the models discussed by hosotani et al. have only fermions
with the adjoint representation. the situation we discussed may be understood as

more realistic, since matter with the fundamental representation is needed in gut.

2. it should be stressed that in our model, once the representation of the matter eld is
xed, there is no arbitrariness in ve and in the breaking pattern of gauge symmetry,

13

whereas in ordinary gut they depend crucially on the values of many parameters of
self-coupling of the higgs, such as the 24 representation of the higgs in su(5). we

have shown that in our model the vevs of higgs (as extra space components of the
gauge boson) are dynamically (and uniquely) chosen as the bottom of ve. as a bonus
we have also shown that our 4-dimensional gauge theory must live at a at bottom
of ve, namely that the higgs does not suer from the large nite mass correction
encountered in our previous work, in which an abelian gauge theory is discussed. 1)

to construct a realistic model, we must investigate models with larger gauge groups, such
as su(5), and with other representations, such as 10 of su(5). moreover, the compactied
manifold may be a larger and more complicated one, such as t n(n  2). the analysis
may become somewhat more complicated. the f2c approximation mentioned in this paper

should help to simplify the analysis.
