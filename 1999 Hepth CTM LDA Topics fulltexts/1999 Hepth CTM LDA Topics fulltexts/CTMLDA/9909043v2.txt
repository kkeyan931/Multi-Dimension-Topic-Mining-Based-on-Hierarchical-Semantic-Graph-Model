an analysis of one and two point functions of the energy momentum tensor on ho-
mogeneous spaces of constant curvature is undertaken. the possibility of proving
a c-theorem in this framework is discussed, in particular in relation to the coe-
cients c, a, which appear in the energy momentum tensor trace on general curved
backgrounds in four dimensions. ward identities relating the correlation functions
are derived and explicit expressions are obtained for free scalar, spinor eld theo-
ries in general dimensions and also free vector elds in dimension four. a natural
geometric formalism which is independent of any choice of coordinates is used and
the role of conformal symmetries on such constant curvature spaces is analysed.
the results are shown to be constrained by the operator product expansion. for
negative curvature the spectral representation, involving unitary positive energy
representations of o(d  1, 2), for two point functions of vector currents is derived
in detail and extended to the energy momentum tensor by analogy. it is demon-
strated that, at non coincident points, the two point functions are not related to a
in any direct fashion and there is no straightforward demonstration obtainable in
this framework of irreversibility under renormalisation group ow of any function of
the couplings for four dimensional eld theories which reduces to a at xed points.

1. introduction

the energy momentum tensor is a universal probe in any relativistic quantum eld
theory. parameters which are dened through correlation functions of the energy momen-
tum tensor, or its expectation value when the space on which the theory is dened has
non trivial topology or non zero curvature, may serve to specify the theory independent
of any particular formulation in terms of elementary elds. such parameters should be
well dened at any renormalisation group xed point where the theory becomes conformal,
which should also include the case of free theories. the cardinal example of course is the
virasoro central charge c for two dimensional conformal eld theories which may be dened
through the trace of the energy momentum tensor on a curved background, the coecient
of the energy momentum tensor two point function on at space r2 or a universal term
in the dependence of the casimir energy on the circumference when the underlying space
is compactied on a cylinder s1  r [1]. furthermore away from critical points c may
be generalised to a function of the couplings c(g) which monotonically decreases under
rg ow as the basic scale of the theory is evolved to large distances and the couplings
are attracted to any potential infra red xed point. this is the content of the celebrated
zamolodchikov c-theorem [2] and, since in a two dimensional conformal eld theory c may
be interpreted as a measure of the degrees of freedom, it incorporates the physical intuition
that rg ow is irreversible as a consequence of loss of information concerning details at
short distances in any infra red limit.1

many eorts have been made to generalise such ideas beyond two dimensions to re-
alistic four dimensional eld theories [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12], even making connections to
modern ideas of holography [13,14]. in particular cardy [4] discussed a possible candidate
for c(g) in terms of the energy momentum tensor trace on a curved background. even
at a conformal xed point there are now two parameters for the two independent scalars
formed from the curvature appearing in the energy momentum tensor trace, which may be
denoted by c, a. cardys conjecture for a four dimensional generalisation of the c-theorem
however involved a, the coecient of the four dimensional euler density. an analysis of
this proposal for general four dimensional renormalisable quantum eld theories demon-
strated [5] irreversibility of the rg ow of a quantity a, which is equal to a for vanishing
-functions, in some neighbourhood of weak coupling. recently non perturbative formulae
for the ow of both c and a between uv asymptotically free xed points and non trivial
ir xed points in n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories were proposed, on the basis of
anomaly calculations, which demonstrated that the rg ow of a is monotonic, so long as
the anomalous dimensions of the basic chiral elds are not too large [15,16]. the super-

given in [3].

symmetric results were subsequently shown to be in accord with the previous perturbative
discussions for general theories in [17].

it is therefore natural to try to analyse further how far two dimensional results may be
generalised. in this investigation we restrict attention to homogeneous spaces of constant
curvature, for theories continued to a space with positive denite metric, either the d-
dimensional sphere sd or the negative curvature hyperboloid h d. for such spaces

r = 2(cid:0)gg  gg(cid:1)  r = d(d  1)2 ,

(1.1)

with 1/ a length scale. the dependence on the metric is then reduced to just the single
parameter  and we may write



d
d

g = 2g + lug , lug = u +  u ,

(1.2)

where u is a vector eld which depends on the particular choice of coordinates. the
simplicity of considering homogeneous spaces of constant curvature is that it allows a
group theoretic analysis which, once the appropriate basis functions are introduced, is not
essentially more complicated than for at space [18,19]. the virtues of considering eld
theories on negative curvature spaces were advocated in [20].

we further restrict our attention here to one and two point correlation functions where
the positivity properties arising from unitarity are most evident. we compare and contrast
results for two and four dimensional theories in this context. for the case of negative cur-
vature an earlier analysis was given in [6] and some parts of our discussion are similar but
we attempt to consider here a complete set of ward and trace identities. an analysis of
consistency conditions related to the energy momentum tensor trace anomaly and renor-
malisation group equations was undertaken in [21] for general curved space backgrounds.
the consistency conditions obtained here are a subset of those in [21] but are here directly
related to physical correlation functions.

a general framework for such identities together with rg equations is then given
in the next section. this is specialised to two and four dimensions in sections 3 and
in section 5 we discuss a geometric approach appropriate for describing two point
4.
functions of tensor elds on spaces of constant curvature.
in section 6 the conformal
killing equation is solved, independently of any choice of coordinates in d-dimensions, and
the corresponding conformal group o(d+1, 1) identied as well as the appropriate isometry
groups. a scalar function s of two points x, y, which transforms homogeneously under
conformal transformations, is constructed. an associated bi-vector, related to inversions,
which also transforms simply under conformal transformations is found. these results
allow the construction of conformally covariant two point functions for any tensor elds.

2

the geometric formalism is extended to spinor elds in section 7 and the corresponding
inversion matrix as well as explicit forms for killing spinors are obtained. the formalism
of section 5 is applied in section 8 to determine a general expression for the two point
function of the energy momentum tensor ht (x)t(y)i and the necessary conditions
required to satisfy the conservation equation for the energy momentum tensor are obtained.
on s2 or h 2 for a traceless energy momentum tensor these have simple solutions with
only an undetermined overall scale for s2. expressions which satisfy the conservation
equations automatically are found in terms of two independent scalar functions which can
be interpreted as corresponding to spin-0 and spin-2 contributions. the spin-2 function
gives a form for the two point function appropriate to a traceless energy momentum tensor.
it is shown how to determine generally each of the scalar functions for any expression for
the two point function obeying the conservation equations. in section 9 the arbitrariness
in this decomposition, arising when the the spin-0 scalar function is a green function for
2  1
d1 r and the resulting expression for the energy momentum tensor two point
function is traceless, is discussed. in two dimensions, when the spin-2 function is absent,
ht (x)t(y)i is determined uniquely for conformal theories with the overall scale set
by the virasoro central charge c.
in section 10 we calculate the form of the two point
function in the conformal limit for free scalar and spinor elds in general dimensions and
also for free vectors in four dimensions. for sd the results are proportional to the unique
conformally covariant form with the same overall coecient ct as on at space. on h d
the results are not unique but there is a simple expression for the leading singular term
with the same coecient ct . some aspects of these results are understood in section 11
using the operator product expansion although its form on spaces of non zero curvature
is not yet fully clear. in section 12 we discuss the positive energy unitary representations
of o(d  1, 2) and their signicance for unitary quantum eld theories on h d. we obtain
in detail the representation for a spin 1 lowest weight state. the technicalities of this
section are then used in section 13 to obtain the spectral representation for the two point
function of a vector eld when the intermediate states are decomposed into representations
of o(d  1, 2). this work motivates a natural extension giving the spectral representation
of the energy momentum tensor two point function. finally in section 14 general aspects of
the c-theorem are discussed and diculties in deriving it for a eld theory dened on a space
of constant curvature are described. in appendix a the crucial results obtained in section
8 for positive curvature are listed in the negative curvature case while the calculation of
green functions in terms of hypergeometric functions is described in appendix b. some
detailed results for the spin one representation of o(d  1, 2), and the calculation of the
norms of the basis states, are deferred to appendix c. this also contains a summary of some
properties of the arbitrary dimension spherical harmonics used in section 12. in appendix
d we discuss the example of a free massive scalar eld , following [10], where the mass

3

is the sole coupling. this involves the explicit construction of the spectral representation
for 2.

2. ward identities and consistency conditions

our subsequent discussion depends crucially on the ward and trace identities satised
by correlation functions involving the energy momentum tensor. these are not necessarily
unique since there may be ambiguous local contact term, involving -functions, in any two
or higher point function. in consequence it is useful to rst give a precise derivation of
the identities in a consistent framework and later take account of the potential freedom
of contact terms. to this end we consider the vacuum functional w for a quantum eld
theory dened on an arbitrarily curved space with metric g(x) and also local sources gi(x)
coupled to a set of scalar elds oi(x). the expectation values of the quantum operator
elds in the background for an arbitrary metric but with gi(x) = gi the physical coupling
constants (which are taken to be dimensionless by introducing an appropriate power of a
scale  on which the metric depends) are given by

pg(x)ht (x)i = 2



g(x)

w(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)gi(x)=gi

, pg(x)hoi(x)i = 



gi(x)

,

(2.1)

w(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)gi(x)=gi

where the functional derivatives, for d-dimensions, are dened by



g(x)

g(y) = (

)

d(x  y) ,



gi(x)

gj(y) = i

jd(x  y) .

(2.2)

with this prescription the associated two point functions are given by

,

(2.3)

pg(x)pg(y)ht (x)t(y)i = 4
pg(x)pg(y)hoi(x)oj(y)i =

g(x)g(y)

2

2

gi(x)gj(y)

w(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)gi(x)=gi
w(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)gi(x)=gi

,

which are manifestly symmetric. we may also similarly dene ht (x)oj(y)i. in general
the correlation functions ht (x) . . .oj(y) . . .i formed from t and the scalar elds oj
form a basic set related by ward identities and obeying rg equations which are the subject
of discussion here.

the ward identities may be derived from the condition that w is a scalar functional,
corresponding to the requirement that any regularisation preserves invariance under dif-
feomorphisms, which implies

z ddx(cid:16)(v +  v)



g + vgi 

gi(cid:17)w = 0 .

(2.4)

4

it is easy to see that this gives

and also

hti = 0 ,

(2.5)


 d(x, y)(cid:1)ht(x)i + 2(cid:0)
ht (x)t(y)i = (cid:0)
ht (x)oi(y)i =  d(x, y)hoi(x)i .

(2.6b)

(

) d(x, y)ht(x)i(cid:1) , (2.6a)

in these equations, which contain d(x, y) = d(x y)/pg(x), the appropriate connections

to appear in covariant derivatives need to be clearly specied. any ambiguities are here
resolved by using the convention that the indices , ,  are regarded as at x while , 
are at y, covariant derivatives such as  involve dierentiation with respect to x and
have the required connection necessary according to the tensorial structure at x.

we also consider associated trace identities which take the form

ghti  hi = a ,

 = ioi ,

(2.7)

where a is the anomalous contribution to the trace present in eld theories on a curved
background. a is a local scalar formed from the the riemann curvature and its deriva-
tives and obeys consistency conditions which correspond to integrability conditions for
w . in (2.7) we have assumed that the operators oi form a basis for the trace of the en-
ergy momentum tensor with coecients the -functions corresponding to the couplings gi.
derivatives of lower dimensional operators are thus neglected in (2.7) but if present they
do not change the essential results of the analysis, as discussed in [21]. as a consequence
of (2.7) with the denitions (2.3) we have

g(x)ht (x)t(y)i  h(x)t(y)i  2ht(y)i d(x, y) = a(x, y) ,

(2.8)

where a(x, y) is formed from d(x, y) and derivatives and is explicitly given by

a(x, y) = 

2

pg(x)pg(y)



g(y)(cid:0)ga(x)(cid:1) .

(2.9)

we further have

g(x)ht (x)oi(y)i  h(x)oi(y)i + ijhoj(y)i d(x, y) = bi(x, y) .

(2.10)

where bi(x, y) also has support only for x = y. the appearance of ij reects the fact
that this is the anomalous dimension matrix for the operators oj. it is easy to see that
we must have for consistency

a(x, y) = d(x, y)a(y) ,

z ddyg bi(x, y) = ia(x) ,

(2.11)

5

and also

h(x, y) = g(y)a(x, y) + bi(y, x)i = h(y, x) .

(2.12)

which is an integrability condition. the necessity of (2.12) may be seen by combining (2.8)
and (2.10) to give

g(x)g(y)ht (x)t(y)i  h(x)(y)i

= 2g(y)ht(y)i d(x, y)  iijhoj(y)i d(x, y) + h(x, y) .

(2.13)

to obtain further consistency conditions it is necessary also to consider the linear rg
equations for the one and two point functions. first we dene the derivative operator
which generates constant rescalings of the metric and the associated ow of the couplings
by

d = 2z ddx g



g + i 
gi .

(2.14)

for a constant curvature metric depending on a single parameter  as in (1.1) we have, up
to the eects of the reparameterisation generated by u as in (1.2),

2z ddx g


g  

d
d

.

with the denition (2.14) the rg equations for hti and hoii are then

(d + d  2)hti = c ,
(d + d)hoii + ijhoji = ci ,

c (x) = z ddyg a (y, x) ,
ci(x) = z ddyg bi(y, x) .

for the two point functions we have

where

+ jkhoi(x)ok(y)i  ijkhok(x)id(x, y) = gij(x, y) .

(2.21)

given an expression for the trace anomaly a on a general curved space c and e,, as
well as a, may be directly calculated. for d = 2 and 4 general forms for f,i(x, y) and
gij(x, y) = gji(y, x) may be constructed as a sum of terms involving the curvature and
derivatives of d(x, y) with the appropriate dimension. from (2.6b) we must have

f,i(x, y) =  d(x, y)ci(x) ,

(2.22)

and (2.6a) gives a relation between e, and c .

requiring consistency of (2.16a, b) and (2.17),(2.19),(2.21) with (2.8),(2.10) leads to

(d + 2d  2)a(x, y) = g(x)e,(x, y)  f,i(y, x)i  2c(y)d(x, y) ,

(2.23)

and

(d + 2d)bi(x, y) + ij(cid:0)bj (x, y)  cj (y)d(x, y)(cid:1) = gf,i(x, y)  gij (x, y)j .

(2.24)

the identities obtained above are explored in the following sections in the particular
cases of two and four dimensions after restricting to spaces of constant curvature, as given
in (1.1). on such homogeneous spaces hoii and also the curvature trace anomaly a in
(2.7) are just constants and also

ht (x)i = 

1
d

cdg (x) ,

(2.25)

with c(g) dimensionless. the result (2.25) of course trivially satises (2.5). furthermore
(2.6a) simplies in this case to

ht (x)t(y)i =

(2.31)

in two dimensions the curved space trace anomaly for an arbitrary metric is just

proportional to the scalar curvature so that in (2.7) we may write

in this case in (2.8) and (2.10) we now take

2a = 1

12 c r .

2a(x, y) = 1

6 wi22(x, y) ,

(3.1)

(3.2)

which are in accord with (2.11) and where wi(g) is a vector function of the couplings.
furthermore in two dimensions c and e, are both zero so that (2.16a) and (2.17)
now become

while in (2.16b) and (2.19) we now assume

dhti = 0 ,

dht(x)t(y)i = 0 ,

2ci =  1

12 ic r ,

2f,i(x, y) =  1

6 ic(cid:0)  g2(cid:1)2(x, y) ,

(3.3)

2gij(x, y) = 1

6 gij22(x, y) + 1

12 ijc r2(x, y) .

(3.6)

with the expressions in (3.2) and (3.4) the consistency condition (2.23) is identically

satised. inserting the appropriate forms into (2.24) leads to the single relation

ic  gijj = lwi = j jwi  ij wj .

if we dene

then (3.7) may be rewritten as

c = c + wii ,

ic = (cid:0)gij + iwj  jwi(cid:1)j  iic = gijij .

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

we now show how the ward and trace identities may be solved, after restricting to a
homogeneous space of constant curvature, to give explicit forms for the two point functions
with relations between them. assuming (2.25) we may take

(2)2ht (x)t(y)icon

= (cid:0)  g2  1

2 gr(cid:1)f (x, y)(cid:0)   2g  1

2 gr(cid:1) ,

(3.10)

which satises (2.26) identically. in a similar fashion

(2)2(cid:0)ht (x)oi(y)i  ghoii2(x, y)(cid:1) = (cid:0)  g2  1

2 g r(cid:1)gi(x, y)(cid:0) 2  r(cid:1) ,

(3.11)

automatically satises (2.6b). applying (2.8) with (3.2) gives the relations

f (x, y) = gi(x, y)i + 1

3 c k0(x, y) ,

assuming k0 is a solution of

(2  r)k0(x, y) = 22(x, y) .

(3.12)

(3.13)

explicit solutions of this equation are discussed later. for the case of the positive curvature
sphere (3.13) has to be modied although this does not change (3.12) or (3.10). the rg
equations for the two point functions in (3.10) and (3.11) may now be reexpressed in terms
of f and gi,

as is well known in any even dimension beyond two dimensions there are several
possible curvature dependent terms which may contribute to the energy momentum tensor
trace. for four dimensions we take2

with c the weyl tensor. g is a topological density which is reected by its variation being
a total divergence,

for general metrics then (2.9) gives

requires b = 0 if i = 0. on a homogeneous space with (1.1) then c = 0 and

g = 1

v  = 1

3 r(cid:0)  g + (gg)(cid:1) ,

so that in this case the anomaly reduces to just

a = a + 6b ,

and using (4.5)

22a(x, y) =  1

(4.10b)

where e c

,(x) is the projector at x onto tensors with the symmetry and traceless

c = c[][] , c[] = 0 , gc = 0 .

(4.12)

an explicit form for e c is given later by (8.21) for y = x. the term involving e c in (4.11)
is automatically conserved and traceless since, on spaces of constant curvature when (1.1)
holds, for any c satisfying (4.12)

t = c  t = t , gt = 0 , t = 0 .

(4.13)

the remaining term h,(x, y) in (4.11) is then dened by

(
) g 4(x, y)(cid:1) + (cid:0)
h,(x, y) = (cid:0)
(

(

(4.14)

and, with the conventions on covariant derivatives described above, this is symmetric

h,(x, y) = h,(y, x) ,

(4.15)

and, for constant curvature, satises

h,(x, y) = 0 , h,(x, y)g(y) = 2(cid:0)g2 1

4 gr(cid:1)4(x, y) . (4.16)

as a consequence of (4.13) and (4.16) the form (4.11) satises

e,(x, y) = 0 ,

22g(x)e,(x, y) = 3b24(x, y)(cid:0)   2g  1

4 gr(cid:1) .

(4.17)

in addition the corresponding quantities entering into (2.19) and (2.21) may now be
2 di2r, its

assumed to be given by (for a general metric then 22ci may contain a term 1
variation according to (2.20) gives rise to the corresponding term below)

(4.18)

and

22gij (x, y) = gij224(x, y) + lij r24(x, y)  1

48 ij a r24(x, y) .

(4.19)

inserting the results (4.7), (4.17) and (4.18) into (2.23) then gives

3b = dii .

(4.20)

this provides an alternative demonstration of the vanishing of the coecient of the r2
trace anomaly at a xed point. imposing now (2.24) leads to two relations,

lui = gijj + 3di ,

lyi = lijj + di + 1

4 ia ,

(4.21)

and eliminating di then gives an analogous formula to (3.7),

3

4 ia = gijj  l ui ,

gij = gij  3lij ,

ui = ui  3yi .

(4.22)

in order to apply these results we consider explicit forms for the two point functions

for a homogeneous space of constant curvature given by

(22)2hoi(x)oj(y)i = (cid:0)  2  1

3 r(cid:1)hij(x, y)(cid:0) 2  1

3 r(cid:1) ,

(4.23)

and

(22)2(cid:0)ht (x)oi(y)ighoii4(x, y)(cid:1) = (cid:0)g2 1

4 gr(cid:1)gi(x, y)(cid:0) 2 1

3 r(cid:1) ,

(4.24)

which satises (2.6b). with the result (4.8) the relation (2.10) leads to

3gj(x, y) = ihij(x, y)  uj 224(x, y) + (yj  2

3 uj)rk0(x, y) + vjk1(x, y) ,

vj = (cid:0) 1

uj(cid:1)  22(cid:0)4hoji + jkhoki(cid:1) ,

where

3 r)k1(x, y) = k0(x, y) .

(2  1
13

(4.25)

(4.26)

as in two dimensions the equation for k0 must be modied in the positive curvature case
as demonstrated for its explicit solution found later. the rg equations (2.21) and (2.19)
now become

(d + 4)hij(x, y) + ikhkj(x, y) + jkhjk(x, y)

= gij 224(x, y)  (lij  2

and

(d + 4)gi(x, y) + ij gj(x, y) = di 224(x, y) + 1

4 ia  di)rk0(x, y) .

compatibility of (4.28) and (4.27) with (4.25), which requires

(d + 4)vj + jkvk = sjkk ,

is guaranteed as a consequence of (4.21).

(4.27)

(4.28)

(4.29)

it remains to nd a general form for the energy momentum tensor two point function.
for homogeneous spaces in general dimensions other than two this involves two independent
tensor structures which represent spin 2 and spin 0. for the conserved two point function
dened by (2.28)

(22)2ht (x)t(y)icon = (cid:0)e c

+(cid:0)  g2  1

,(x, y)f2(x, y)(cid:1)  
4 g r(cid:1)f0(x, y)(cid:0)   2g  1

4 gr(cid:1) ,

(4.30)

where e c
,(x, y) is a bi-tensor, constructed explicitly later, which satises the sym-
metry and traceless conditions of the weyl tensor separately at x and y and which for
x = y reduces to the projector e c
,(x) introduced above. both expressions on
the right hand side of (4.30) are automatically conserved, the rst term, involving f2,
using (4.13) is in addition traceless. it is important to recognise that the decomposition in
(4.30) is not unique. if f0  k0, satisfying (4.26), then this term is also both conserved
and traceless for non coincident x, y and, as shown in section 8, any conserved traceless
two point function can always be written in terms of an appropriate f2 for x 6= y. this
therefore leads to the relation

22h,(x, y) = 8(cid:0)e c

,(x, y)k2(x, y)(cid:1)  

3(cid:0)  g2  1
 2

4 gr(cid:1)k0(x, y)(cid:0)   2g  1

4 gr(cid:1) ,

(4.31)

for a suitable k2(x, y) where h,(x, y) is purely a local contact term. due to the
derivatives the right hand side of (4.31) is well dened as a distribution. by considering

14

the divergence and trace of both sides of this relation h,(x, y) may be identied with
the previous denition in (4.14) since it is the unique form satisfying (4.15) and (4.16).
on at space e c is a constant tensor and k0 and k2 are identical.

applying the decomposition in (4.30) we may rst note, by using the general relation

(2.8) with (4.24) and (4.7), that

3f0(x, y) = gi(x, y)i  1

12 a rk0(x, y) .

(4.32)

in order to implement the rg equation (2.17) it is necessary to rewrite the result for
e,(x, y), which is given by (4.11), by using (4.31) in the more convenient form,
,(x, y)(cid:0)c 224(x, y) + b rk2(x, y)(cid:1)(cid:17)  
22e,(x, y) = 4(cid:16)e c
 b(cid:0)  g2  1

3 rk0(x, y)(cid:1)(cid:0)   2g  1

4 gr(cid:1)(cid:0)4(x, y) + 1

4 gr(cid:1) .

(4.33)

with this result the rg equations reduce to

(d + 4)f2(x, y) = 4(cid:0)c 224(x, y) + b rk2(x, y)(cid:1) ,
(d + 4)f0(x, y) =  b(cid:0)224(x, y) + 1
3 rk0(x, y)(cid:1) .

(4.34a)

(4.34b)

it is important to note that (4.34b) follows directly from the expression (4.32) and (4.28)
so long as (4.20) holds.

the general results simplify if we restrict to a xed point where -functions vanish.

the expectation value of a single energy momentum tensor becomes

162hti(cid:12)(cid:12)i=0 =  1

24 ar2 g ,
or in (2.25) 22c|i=0 = 3a. from (4.25) we must also have
(22)2ht (x)oi(y)i(cid:12)(cid:12)i=0 =  (  1
4 g2)k0(x, y) 1

j = 4i

(4.35)

ujr2 + 22hoji(cid:1) ,

(4.36)

which is the extension of (3.23) to four dimensions. this provides a denition of ui at
a xed point. in the energy momentum tensor two point function f0 =  2
9 a rk0, from
(4.32), and using (4.31) we may write
,(x, y) f2(x, y)(cid:1)  

(22)2ht (x)t(y)icon(cid:12)(cid:12)i=0 = (cid:0)e c
f2(x, y) = f2(x, y)  1

+ 1

24 ar 22h,(x, y) ,
3 a rk2(x, y) .

(4.37)

hence in this case, apart from a contact term, there is only the manifestly conserved and
traceless spin 2 contribution to this two point function.

5. geometrical results for spaces of constant curvature

in order to nd more explicit expressions for the two point functions considered above
we discuss here some geometrical results which allow natural expressions for the two point
functions on homogeneous spaces of constant curvature to be found. a related discussion
was given by allen and jacobsen [22] but there are dierences in derivation and also
application.

our starting point is the geodetic interval (x, y) which is a bi-scalar dened for any
curved manifold which is unique for x in the neighbourhood of y and which satises [23],

g = 2 .

(5.1)

on at space (x, y) = 1
2 (x  y)2. for a homogeneous space of constant curvature then
any t...(x, y), which transforms covariantly under all isometries as a tensor at x and a
scalar at y, may be expanded in a basis formed by (x, y) and g(x) with coecients
functions of (x, y) [22]. thus we may write

 = g f () +  g() .

since, from (5.1),   = , we have

f () + 2g() = 1 .

imposing [, ]  = r

 on (5.2) gives using (1.1)

f ()  f ()g() = 2 ,

or dening  = 1

16

for any bi-tensor, t...,...(x, y), then the basis for expansion may be extended to
include (x, y) , which transforms as a covariant vector at y, and also the bi-vector
g(x, y) = (x, y)  as well as g(y). in practice it is more convenient to introduce

(x, y) which gives parallel transport of vectors along the geodesic from y to x. this is

i 
dened by

for homogeneous spaces as considered here we may write the general form

i 

 = 0 ,

i 

(x, x) =

i = g a()     b() .

inserting this into (5.7) and using (5.1),(5.2),(5.3) gives

a() + g()a() = 0 ,

d

d(cid:0)a() + 2b()(cid:1) = 0 .

solving these with the boundary condition a(0) = 1 gives

a =

sin 



,

sinh 



,

b =

2(cid:0)1  a(cid:1) .

an important consistency check, which follows directly from (5.7), is that

and further we have

i 

i = g ,

ii

 = g ,

(x, y)i 

(x, y) = (x, y)  .

(5.7)

(5.8)

(5.9)

(5.10)

(5.11)

(5.12)

in the following sections these results are used to to obtain a natural form for the
tensorial expansions of two point functions whose coecients are functions of the biscalar
(x, y).
it is convenient to use, as well as the parallel transport bi-vector i, a basis
formed by x and y, which are unit vectors at x, y, given by

 = x,

 y = x ,
i
using (5.11) and (5.12). with these denitions (5.2) and (5.6) then become

 = y ,

  = y ,

xi 

 x =  cot (g  x x) ,  coth (g  x x) ,

and also from (5.8) and (5.10) we have,

 y =   cosec (i + x y) ,  cosech (i + x y) ,
i =  tan 1

2 (g y + x i) ,  tanh 1

at a renormalisation group xed point quantum eld theories are additionally con-
strained by conformal invariance. conformal symmetry may be extended to spaces of non
zero curvature by seeking conformal killing vectors which satisfy

v + v = 2w g ,

w =

1
dv .

(6.1)

on at space the solutions are well known. we show here how it is similarly possible
to solve (6.1) on homogeneous spaces of constant curvature without any restriction to
particular choices of coordinates.4 from (6.1) and (1.1) we rst derive an expression for
two covariant derivatives of v

v = 2(gv  gv)  g w + gw + g w .

also by contracting with  we may obtain5

(d  1)2w + rw = 0 ,

d r)v, which also follows

and by using this with (6.1) together with (d 2)w = (2 + 1
from (6.1), we nd for d 6= 2

w = 2gw .
this is easily extended to arbitrarily many derivatives

(6.4)

(6.5)

(1 . . .2n)w = (2)ng(12 . . . g2n12n)w ,
(1 . . .2n+1)w = (2)ng(12 . . . g2n12n 2n+1)w ,

and then applying the covariant taylor expansion, which for any scalar f takes the form
[24]

f (x) = xn=0

1
n!

1 . . . n(1)n(1 . . .n)f (y) ,

(x, y) = g(y) (x, y)  ,

(6.6)

4 however writing the metric in a conformally at form g = 2 then if v is a solution

of the at space conformal killing equation it remains a solution for the metric g.

5 this demonstrates that there is no solution with w = 1 if r 6= 0 so that there is no dilation

current j = t v satisfying j = gt  except in at space.

18

leads to

w(x) = cos  w(y)

sin  yw(y) , cosh  w(y)

sinh  yw(y) .

(6.7)

this result demonstrates that w(x) is determined completely by the values of w and w
at any arbitrary y so that there are d + 1 independent forms for w (for r > 0 from (6.3)
these correspond to the d + 1 normalisable eigenvectors of 2 with eigenvalue d2). if
we dene

then from (6.2) and (6.4) we get

[v] =  ,

(1 . . .2n)v = (2)nn(cid:0)g(12 . . . g2n12n)v  v(1 g(23 . . . g2n)(cid:1)

(6.10)

it is straightforward to verify, using (5.14) and (5.15), that (6.10) and (6.7) satisfy (6.1).
besides w and w the general expression for v(x) is determined by v and  at some
arbitrary y, giving 1
2 (d + 1)(d + 2) linearly independent vectors. taking y = 0 it is easy to
see that (6.10) and (6.7) reduce to the standard results for at space with v(x) quadratic
and w(x) linear in x. from the denition (6.8) we may also derive

[v1, v2] = v3

using (6.10), (6.7) and (6.11) this is identical with the algebra of matrices w ,

[w1, w2] = w3 ,

(6.14)

(6.15)

(6.16)

it is clear that (6.13) corresponds in both cases to the lie algebra of the d-dimensional
conformal group o(d + 1, 1). if we restrict to killing vectors for which w = 0 it is also
evident that the algebra reduces to that for the isometry groups o(d + 1) or o(d, 1) for sd
or h d respectively as expected.

for construction of conformally covariant expressions for correlation functions it is
necessary to construct bi-scalar functions of x, y which transform homogeneously under
such conformal transformations. in consequence we consider the generalisation s of the
at space (x  y)2 which is required to satisfy

writing s() the left hand side of (6.17) involves

(cid:0)v(x) + v(y)(cid:1)s = (cid:0)w(x) + w(y)(cid:1)s .

(cid:0)v(x)x + v(y)y(cid:1) = tan 1

2 (cid:0)w(x) + w(y)(cid:1) ,

from (6.10) and (6.7). hence (6.17) becomes

s = cot 1

(6.17)

(6.18)

(6.19)

imposing the boundary condition that s  2/2 as x  y gives the solution

(6.20)
so that s may be interpreted as the chordal distance between x and y. for the hyperbolic
case it is useful also to dene

2s = 2(1  cos ) , 2(cosh   1) ,

2s = 2s + 4 = 2(cosh  + 1) .

(6.21)

any power s also transforms homogeneously under conformal transformations, as in
(6.17), and (5.16) gives

(cid:0)2  2(  d + 1)(cid:1)s = (2 + 2  d)s1 .

(6.22)

20

using the bi-scalar s we may further dene a bi-vector by

 ln s(x, y)  =

2

s(x, y) i(x, y) ,

which gives

i = i + 2x y .

(6.23)

(6.24)

i generalises the inversion tensor to spaces of constant curvature and, from (5.11) and
(5.12), we have i 
i = g. from its denition (6.23) and (6.17), with (6.8), we have

(cid:0)v(x) + v(y)(cid:1)i(x, y) = 

 (x)i(x, y) + 

(y)i(x, y) .

(6.25)

for the positive curvature case since s(x, y) is single valued for arbitrary x, y (6.23) also
ensures that i is well dened at  = .

for later reference it is useful also to dene related bi-vector

i =  1

2 s  = i + (1  cos )x y ,

i  (cosh   1)x y ,

which satises

7. spinors

 i = g sin  y , g sinh  y .

(6.26)

(6.27)

for spinor elds we may dene, using vielbeins as usual, dirac matrices (x) satis-
fying {, } = 2g. the essential geometrical object for our purposes is the bispinor
i(x, y) which acting on spinor at y parallel transports it along the geodesic from y to x.
this satises

xi = 0 ,

i(x, x) = 1 ,

(7.1)

where  = + is the spinor covariant derivative. for a homogeneous space of constant
curvature we follow a similar approach to that of allen and lutken in four dimensions [25]
and express the covariant derivative in a form compatible with (7.1),

i(x, y) =  1

2  ()(x  x)i(x, y) .

using (5.14) we may then nd

[]i(x, y) = 1

for a spinor  the commutator of covariant derivatives is given by

(7.4)

using (1.1). applying this integrability condition to (7.3) leads to equations for  which
are readily solved giving

and hence (7.2) becomes

the spinor parallel transport i(x, y) is easily seem to satisfy

and also

i(x, y)i(y, x) = 1 ,

i(x, y)i(y, x) = i 

(x, y) ,

(7.5)

(7.6)

(7.7)

(7.8)

which may be veried my applying a covariant derivative to both sides, using (7.6) with
(7.5) as well as (5.15).

it is also useful to dene

i(x, y) = xi(x, y) = i(x, y)y ,

(7.9)

which plays the role of the inversion matrix on spinors analogous to the inversion tensor
(6.24). it is easy to see, using (7.8), that

tr(cid:0)i(x, y)i(y, x)(cid:1) = 2

and from (7.9)

1

2 di(x, y) ,

tr(cid:0)i(x, y)i(y, x)(cid:1) = 2

1

2 di(x, y) .

(7.10)

from (7.6) and (7.5) we may also easily obtain

i(x, y)i(y, x) = 1 .

i(x, y) =  cot 1

i(x, y) =   cot 1

4 [, x]i(x, y) ,
2  i(x, y) 1

4 [, y] .

(7.11)

(7.12)

the importance of i is that it transforms homogeneously under conformal transformations
similarly to (6.25) since from (7.12), using (6.10) and (6.11) and the spin matrices dened
in (7.4),

v(x)i(x, y) + i(x, y)v(y) = 1

2  (x)si(x, y)  i(x, y) 1

2 (y)s .

(7.13)

22

using the above results it is easy to construct a spinor green function satisfying

s(x, y) = d(x, y) ,

which are then given by

s(x, y)+ =

s(x, y) =

1

i(x, y)(cid:19) ,

where

sd =

.

(7.14)

(7.15)

(7.16)

in the negative curvature case there are two inequivalent green functions which correspond
to two alternative boundary conditions and are appropriate for dierent spinor represen-
tations [25]6. the boundary conditions in either case violate chiral symmetry.

following [26] and [25] we may also construct a killing bispinor which satises the

killing spinor equation at x and at y. consistent with (7.4) a killing spinor  satises

 =  1

2 i ,  1

2  .

(7.17)

such spinors allow the construction of solutions of the dirac equation in terms of those for
a scalar eld since if

then

(cid:16)  2 +

d  2

 = (cid:0)( + )(cid:1) ,

r(cid:17) = 0   = 0 if  =  1

2 i(d  2),  1

2 (d  2) .

(7.18)

(7.19)

writing the killing bispinor in the general form s(x, y) = p()i(x, y) + q()i(x, y) and
using (7.6),(7.5) and (7.12) then leads to dierential equations for p, q which are easily
solved,

s = cos 1

2 i  i sin 1

2 i , cosh 1

2 i  sinh 1

2 i .

these satisfy

s =  1

2 is ,  1

2 s ,

s =  1

2 is ,  1

2 s ,

and hence for any solution of (7.17) we may write

6 in [20] the  is replaced in four dimensions by an arbitrary phase ei5 .

(x) = s(x, y)(y) ,

23

(7.20)

(7.21)

(7.22)

so that the general solution is determined by a xed spinor at any arbitrary point y. this
gives solutions coinciding with those found with particular coordinate choices [27]. it is of
course possible to form killing vectors from killing spinors, this is exemplied here by

s(y, x)s+(x, y) = g is(y, x)s+(x, y) , g s(y, x)s+(x, y) ,
(s+(y, x))s+(x, y) = 0 .

(7.23)

furthermore from (7.20)

s(y, x)s+(x, y) = i
s+(y, x)s+(x, y) = i

which are in accord with the general form exhibited in (6.10).

8. two point functions on spaces of constant curvature

in this section we obtain a general decomposition for the two point function of the
energy momentum tensor for arbitrary dimension d using the geometrical results of the
previous section. for simplicity we conne our attention here to the positive curvature
sphere sd although they are easily extended to the negative curvature case using the usual
correspondence between trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. the critical formulae are
displayed in appendix a.

it is convenient rst to consider  (x, y) which is a symmetric tensor at x and has

the form

 (x, y) = x xa() + gb() .

imposing the conservation equation  (x, y) = 0, using (5.14) easily gives

a + b + (d  1) cot  a = 0 .

(8.1)

(8.2)

imposing also the traceless condition g(x)(x, y) = 0, or a + db = 0, leads to a
solution

 (x, y) = k(sin )d(dx x  g) .

(8.3)

however such a solution is unacceptable due to the singularity at  = , although there is
no diculty with the corresponding solution in the hyperbolic case when sin   sinh .

24

the corresponding results for the two point function of the energy momentum tensor
are less trivial. the general form for a bi-tensor ,(x, y), symmetric in  and ,
may be reduced to six independent functions of 

, = x x y y r +(cid:0)i x y +   ,   (cid:1)s +(cid:0)ii + ii(cid:1)t

+(cid:0)x x g u1 + y yg u2(cid:1) + gg v .

for symmetry, ,(x, y) = , (y, x), it is clearly necessary that

u1 = u2 = u ,

and imposing tracelessness, g , = ,g = 0, further requires

p1  r  4s + du = 0 ,

p2  2t + u + dv = 0 .

(8.4)

(8.5)

(8.6)

in two dimensions the basis used in (8.4) is overcomplete as a consequence of the identity

(cid:0)i x y +  ,   (cid:1) +ii +ii +2(cid:0)x x g + y yg g g(cid:1) = 0 . (8.7)
in order to impose the conservation equation ,(x, y) = 0 we make use of

(5.14) as well as (5.15) giving in terms of the expansion (8.4),

 + (d  1)(cot  r + 2 tan 1

r  2s + u2
s  t  + d cot  s + d tan 1
u1

2  t  cosec  u2 = 0 ,
 + v  + (d  1) cot  u1  2 cosec  s + 2 tan 1

2  t = 0 .

2  s) + 2 cot 1

2  s  2 cosec  u2 = 0 ,

(8.8)

requiring the symmetry condition (8.5) of course guarantees that ,  = 0 as well.

for subsequent use it is convenient to rewrite (8.8). with the denitions (8.6), and assum-
ing (8.5), we have

p1

 + p2

 = (d  1) cot p1 .

in addition dening

q = 2t +

d  1
d

(r  4s) ,

then gives (equivalent equations for d = 4 were found in [28]),

q + d cot  q +

1
d

 =  2d cosec  (s  t ) ,
p1

(s  t ) + d cot  (s  t ) =  cosec 
+ cosec 

25

d  1(cid:0)q + (d  2)(d + 1)t(cid:1)

1

1
d

p1 .

(8.9)

(8.10)

(8.11a)

(8.11b)

hence, if p1 = p2 = 0 there are just two independent equations and in this case knowing
q in general determines r, s, t .

in two dimensions these relations provide stronger constraints since on the right hand
side of (8.11b) 4t + r 4s = 2q (it should be noted that r and t  s are independent of
ambiguities that arise from (8.7)). taking the sum and dierence of (8.11a, b) then gives

(r  8s + 8t )  2 tan 1

r + 2 cot 1

2  r + p1
2  (r  8s + 8t ) + p1

 = 2 cosec  p1 ,
 =  2 cosec  p1 .

if p1 = 0 there is a straightforward solution

r = c

4
sin4 1
2 

,

r  8s + 8t = 0 ,

(8.12a)

(8.12b)

(8.13)

where we have imposed the condition that there are no singularities at  = .

explicit forms satisfying (8.8) may be found in terms of the two independent terms
displayed for d = 4 in (4.30). initially we consider the contribution corresponding to spin
zero intermediate states

0,,(x, y) = (cid:0)  g2  (d  1)2g(cid:1)f0()(cid:0)   2g  (d  1)2g(cid:1) .

(8.14)

to evaluate this we rst write

f0()(cid:0)   2g  (d  1)2g(cid:1) = y ya + gb ,

where a(), b() are given by

a = 2(cid:0)f0

  cot  f0
(cid:1) ,

b = 2(cid:0)f0

 + (d  2) cot  f0

 + (d  1)f0(cid:1) .

(8.15)

(8.16)

these expressions automatically satisfy (8.2). inserting (8.15) into (8.14), for general a, b,
further gives

r0 = 2(cid:0)a  (cot  + 4 cosec )a + 4 cosec  cot 1
s0 = 2(cid:0)  cosec a + cosec  cot 1
u0,1 = 2(cid:0)b  cot  b(cid:1) , u0,2 = 2(cid:0)a + (d  2) cot  a  (d  1)(2 cosec2   1)a(cid:1) ,
v0 =  2(cid:0)b + (d  2) cot  b + (d  1)b + 2 cosec2  a(cid:1) .

t0 = 2 cosec2  a ,

2  a(cid:1) ,

2  a(cid:1) ,

(8.17)

it is easy to verify that these satisfy (8.8) and, given the results for a, b in (8.16), that
the symmetry condition (8.5) also holds. with the denitions in (8.6) and also (8.5) we
may note that

p1 + p2 = 2(d  1)(cid:0) cot (a + db) + a + db(cid:1) ,

(8.18)

26

which may easily solved for a + db up to a + db  a + db + k cos , reecting the freedom
of adding a solution of the homogeneous equation. consistency of (8.18) with (8.17) and
(8.5) requires (8.9). furthermore we may obtain from (8.16)

a + db = (d  1)(cid:0)2f0 + d2f0(cid:1) ,

(8.19)

which may be inverted to determine f0 if the constant k in the solution for a + db is
chosen to make this orthogonal to cos  as this is a zero mode for 2 + d2. hence from
(8.16) we may nd a, b separately and then from (8.17) obtain r0, s0, t0, u0, v0 satisfying
the conservation equations. since p1 is determined by (8.9) these functions reproduce the
same p1, p2 in (8.6) as obtained from the original r, s, t, u, v .

besides (8.14) we may use (4.13) to obtain a second solution of the conservation

equations by taking, as in (4.30),

2,,(x, y) = (cid:0)e c

,(x, y)f2()(cid:1)   ,
where for general d the bi-tensor e c may now be expressed explicitly in terms of the
parallel transport matrix i dened in (5.7) by (if d = 3 then e c = 0),
e c

(8.21)

for x = y, when i = g, this reduces to the projector onto tensors with the symmetries
and traceless conditions of the weyl tensor for general d given (4.12). to evaluate (8.20)
we may rst obtain

f,(x, y)g() = (cid:0)e c

,(x, y)f2()(cid:1)   ,

(8.22)

where the bi-tensor f,, which is a symmetric traceless tensor at y, is given by

(8.24)

using (8.22) in (8.20) gives an expression which automatically satises the symmetry and
traceless conditions (8.5) and (8.6) for any g and corresponding to the general form (8.4)
we have solution of (8.8) given in terms of

r2 = 22

(8.25)

if the traceless conditions (8.6) are satised then the expressions given by (8.25) are
generally valid. this is easily seen since, with the denition (8.10) in terms of r2, s2, t2,
we have

q = 22(d  3)d

d + 1
d  1

cosec2 g ,

(8.26)

and (8.11a, b), with p1 = 0, are equivalent to (8.25). conversely for arbitrary r, s, . . .
satisfying (8.8) we may rst solve (8.18) and (8.19) to obtain r0, s0, . . . and then dene
r2 = r  r0, s2 = s  s0, . . . which must necessarily satisfy (8.8) as well as p1 = p2 = 0.
hence dening q in (8.10) in terms of these r2, s2, . . . ensures through (8.26) that they
may all be expressed as in (8.25). furthermore f2 may be found by solving (8.24) in
conjunction with (8.26) which may alternatively be expressed as

4 d2
dw2(cid:0)wd1f2) =

16(d  1)

(d  3)d(d + 1)

wd1q ,

w = 1

2 (1 + cos ) .

(8.27)

assuming q and f2 are non singular at w = 0 ensures a unique solution. in consequence the
general bi-tensor , as given by (8.4) subject to the conservation equation , =
0 may be decomposed into spin 0 and spin 2 pieces,

,(x, y) = 0,,(x, y) + 2,,(x, y) ,

(8.28)

28

where the two independent expressions are given by (8.14) and (8.20).

as an illustration which is relevant for the case of conformally invariant theories, for

which p1 = p2 = 0, we may consider

1
4 r = s = 2t = q = c

1
sd = c( 1

4 2)d(1  w)d ,

when (8.27) may be integrated to give

f2 = c( 1

(d  3)d2(d + 1)2 w2f (d, d; d + 2; w) .

(8.29)

(8.30)

9. ambiguities in spin 0 - spin 2 decomposition

in the previous section we showed how the energy momentum tensor can be decom-
posed into a spin 2 traceless part and a spin 0 contribution determined by the trace, as in
(8.28) with (8.20) and (8.4). however the spin 0 part may also result in a traceless expres-
sion for ht (x)t(y)i if f0 is proportional to the green function k0 for 2  1
d1 r,

f0() = c0 d2k0() ,

(9.1)

this green function is constructed in appendix b. in the positive curvature case, since d2
is an eigenvalue of 2, this satises

(2  d2)k0()+ = sdd(x, y)  kd d cos  .

determining a, b from (8.15) and (8.16) ensures they satisfy (8.2) and from (9.2)

a + db = (d  1)kd cos  .

(9.2)

(9.3)

although the traceless condition a+db = 0 is not satised the corresponding expression for

0,, is since (cid:0) g (2 +2)(cid:1) cos  = 0. for general d a, b are not expressible in

terms of elementary functions but for d = 2, 4, either by solving (9.3) with k2 = 3/2, k4 =
15/4 or by using the explicit form for k0 given in appendix b, we have

a = c0(cid:16) 2
a = c0(cid:16) 2

+ 1

2 2cos (cid:17) ,
s
s2 (2 + 2s) + 3

d = 2 ,

4 4cos (cid:17) ,

d = 4 .

applying (8.17) for d = 2 then gives, if we make use of (8.7) to set u0 = 0,

1

8 r0 = 1

2 s0 = t0 = v0 =

6c0
s2 .

29

(9.4)

(9.5)

assuming (3.22) requires taking c0 = 1
at a xed point

6 c and, using (6.24), gives the following simple form

42ht (x)t(y)i+(cid:12)(cid:12)i=0 =

c

s2(cid:16)ii + ii  gg(cid:17) .

(9.6)

in two dimensions this the unique expression, as expected from the solution obtained in
(8.13), since the contribution corresponding to 2,, is absent. when d = 4 we may
also obtain

t0 = c0

r0 = c0

2

22

2 (2s)2(cid:1) , s0 = c0

s3(cid:0)4 + 32s + 3
s3 (cid:0)96 + 122s + (2s)2(cid:1) ,

2

s3(cid:0)24 + 82s + 3

2 (2s)2(cid:1) ,

in this case if we use (8.10) we nd

and inserting in (8.27) gives

q0 = 80c0

s3 ,

2 d2
dw2(cid:0)w3f2) = 3c0

w3

(1  w)3 .

(9.7)

(9.8)

(9.9)

in consequence the two point function may be equivalently be expressed in terms of f2,
i.e. for f2 determined by (9.9) inserted in (8.24) and hence (8.25) we have r2 = r0 etc.
this corresponds to the existence of k2 in (4.31) and by solving (9.9) we may nd

k2 =

2

8w3(cid:16) w
1  w

+ 11w  w2 + 6(2  w) ln(1  w)(cid:17) .

(9.10)

for the negative curvature case there are no complications due to zero modes as
reected in (9.2). in this case a, b satisfy the traceless condition a + db = 0 and the
dependence on  is simple for any d,

a = c02d2

d

(sinh )d .

(9.11)

for d = 2 the results, setting u0 = 0 as before, involve essentially two independent terms

4 r0 = s0 = 12c0

s2 ,

t0 = v0 = 6c0(cid:18) 1

s2 +

s2(cid:19) .

(9.12)

inserting these expressions into (3.22) with c0 determined in terms of c as above now gives

42ht (x)t(y)i(cid:12)(cid:12)i=0 =

c

s2(cid:16)ii + ii  g g(cid:17)

c

+

s2(cid:16)ii + ii  g g(cid:17) .

30

(9.13)

from (9.11) for any d we may nd using (8.10)

q0 = c02dd(d + 1)

d + (d  1) sinh2 

(sinh )d+2

,

(9.14)

and for d = 4 the complete expression for 2,, is given by

t0 = 4c08

sinh6

, s0 = 4c08 5 cosh  + 1

sinh6

, r0 = 16c08 5 cosh2 + 5 cosh  + 2

sinh6

.

(9.15)

as in the positive curvature case we may solve the equivalent equation to (8.27), given in
(a.10), to determine a corresponding f2 which gives identical forms for r, s, t with u, v
determined by (8.6). in our later discussion of the spectral representation we show that
the resulting f2 cannot be accommodated by imposing the unitarity bound on possible
spin 2 intermediate states.

10. free fields

it is important in order to understand what results may be found from an analysis of
the two point function on spaces of constant curvature to calculate the possible forms at
renormalisation group xed points. to this end we rst consider the results for conformally
invariant free eld theories, free scalar and fermion theories in general dimension d and
abelian gauge elds in dimension four. in each case we initially consider the theory on a
sphere, with r > 0, avoiding boundary conditions which are necessary for the hyperbolic
case when r < 0.

the free conformally coupled scalar eld  satises, on a space of constant curvature
4 d(d  2)2) = 0. the associated energy momentum

where (1.1) holds,   (2  1
tensor may be written in various equivalent forms but here we take

t =

1

d  1(cid:16)(d  2) + g2  (d  1)(d  2)2g(cid:17)2 ,

(10.1)

which is conserved and traceless on the equations of motion.7 correlation functions for
the energy momentum tensor and other composite elds are determined in terms of the
basic scalar eld two point function which for the sphere may be taken, with s the chordal
distance dened in (6.20) and sd given in (7.16), as

h(x)(y)i+ =

comparing with (9.6) for d = 2 gives c = 1 as expected. the expression (10.5) is just what
would be expected by conformal transformation from at space.

when the scalar elds are considered on the negative curvature hyperboloid h d bound-
ary conditions are necessary. for dirichlet boundary conditions the basic two point func-

these results satisfy the traceless conditions (8.6), as expected, and further for d = 2 the
terms involving ss disappear as a consequence of (8.7) and the result is compatible with
(9.13) for c = 1. the expression written in (10.9) is such that the dierent terms separately
obey the conservation equations. the resulting expression is no longer in the simple form
given by (10.5) in the positive curvature case but if the terms involving ss, which vanish
if d = 2, are dropped we have

with the same result for ct as in (10.6). the remaining terms present in (10.9) can be
understood in terms of the operator product expansion but it is clear that the form given
in (10.10) cannot be the unique expression for conformal eld theories.

for massless vector elds, satisfying the free equations f + a/ = 0 with
f = a  a and  a gauge xing parameter, we restrict to d = 4 when the theory
is conformally invariant on at space. neglecting terms which are irrelevant in gauge
invariant correlation functions the energy momentum tensor is

t = ff

  1

4 g ff  .

(10.11)

from the two point functions of the gauge eld a, which have been obtained in [22] and
more recently in [29] and are discussed in appendix b, the two point correlation functions
of the eld strength f are simple

hf (x)f(y)i+ =

(10.12)

with the explicit form (10.11) it is straightforward to calculate in this case that the energy
momentum tensor two point function is just as in (10.5) or (10.10) for d = 4 with

ct,v = 8 .

(10.13)

we may also easily show that

ht (x)ff (y)i+ = 0 ,

for massless spinor elds, satisfying  = 0, the energy momentum tensor may

be taken as

(10.15)

which is conserved and traceless for any d. the formalism for spinors on constant curvature
spaces was described in section 7 and the basic two point functions were obtained in (7.15)
in terms of the inversion bispinor i(x, y) and parallel transport bispinor i(x, y) giving

11. operator product expansion

the singular behaviour of the above results for two point functions for free eld
theories may be understood in terms of the operator product expansion. this may also be
applied for non trivial interacting theories to determine the various possible contributions
to two, and higher, point functions. we restrict here to the situation of theories at a xed
point, so that the at space theory is conformally invariant, and further consider just the
operator product expansions involving the energy momentum tensor and a scalar eld o
with an arbitrary dimension . on curved space the leading term in any operator product
expansion coecient is determined by the corresponding results on at space [30,31]. using

34

the notation of section 5 we consider rst the operator product expansion of t and o
which may be written as

t (x)o(y)  


d  1

1
sd

1
2 d(cid:0)dx x  g(cid:1)o(y) .
s 1

(11.1)

the overall coecient is determined through ward identities [30,31]. secondly the contri-
bution of the scalar o to the operator product expansion of two energy momentum tensors
has the form

t (x)t(y) 

1
sd 1

2 (cid:16)a x x y y + b(cid:0)x yi +   ,   (cid:1)

+ c(cid:0)ii + ii(cid:1)  traces(, )(cid:17)o(y) ,

(11.2)

where a, b, c satisfy the relations, derived essentially by imposing the conservation equations
on the expansion coecient,

(a  4b)(cid:0)1  1

2 (d  )(d  1)(cid:1) + db = 0 ,

a  4b  d(d  )b + d(2d  )c = 0 .

(11.3)

in this case there remains a single undetermined scale reecting the arbitrariness in the
normalisation of o.

the operator product (11.1) is in accord with the the leading singular behaviour as

s  0 of the expressions (10.8), (10.14) and (10.19) in the hyperbolic case taking then

h2i = 

1

(d  2)sd (cid:0) 1

2 )d2,

hff i = 

3
42 4 ,

h i = 

1
2 d

2

sd (cid:0) 1

2 )d1 .

(11.4)
these results for the one-point functions follow directly from (10.7), (10.12) and (10.16)
when the coincident limit is regularised by dropping the singular contributions in s (which
is consistent with the vanishing of these one-point functions in the spherical case). as
usual with dimensional regularisation this prescription is essentially unambiguous for d 6=
integer, but for the fermion case the result for h i is unique and well dened even at
d = 4 since it is non zero only if chirality is violated so that the rst term in (10.16) cannot
contribute. the form of the two point function for the energy momentum tensor in the
case of scalar elds given by (10.9) may also be understood by using the operator product
expansion in (11.2). for a free scalar theory taking o  2, which has dimension d  2,
we have

,

b = (d + 2)c ,

a = (d + 2)(d + 4)c ,

(11.5)

c =

d(d  2)2
4(d  1)2

1
sd

which satisfy (11.3). with the result (11.4) for h2i (11.2) and (11.5) generate the terms
in (10.9)  s 1
2 d1 as s  0. there are no corresponding contributions in the case of free

35

vectors or fermions from hff i or h i since these operators do not appear in the
operator product expansion of two energy momentum tensors, for  by chirality and for
ff  for free vector theories in d = 4 by direct calculation [31]. although the overall
normalisation of a, b, c in (11.3) is arbitrary such freedom is absent from the associated
contributions to ht (x)t(y)i since it is cancelled by a corresponding factor in hoi.

although the above results demonstrate the relevance of the operator product expan-
sion to understanding the form of the two point function on spaces of constant curvature
there are also areas where its role is less transparent. it was our initial hope, based on the
fact that the operator product expansion of two energy momentum tensors always contains
the energy momentum tensor itself and that its one point function, which has the form
shown in (2.25), is in general non zero, that expression for the two point function for the en-
ergy momentum tensor on such spaces would involve its coecient c. in particular in four
dimensions at a xed point, as a consequence of (4.35), this would require a dependence on
the parameter a, which is dened initially through the energy momentum tensor trace on
general curved backgrounds, in some evident fashion. such a result would be signicant
since a is the favourite candidate for a four dimensional generalisation of the c-theorem
[4] (there is now strong theoretical support for this conjecture in supersymmetric theories
[15]) and it could be hoped that a proof of the c-theorem in four dimensions might be
found in terms of the two point functions of the energy momentum tensor on curved space
following a similar approach to the original discussion of zamolodchikov [2]. nevertheless,
despite the arguments based on the operator product expansion for the appearance of the
parameter a in the two point function at non coincident points, this expectation is not
supported by the explicit free eld expressions obtained in section 10. this is most ap-
parent from the results for fermions and vectors which are have the identical form (10.10)
when d = 4 with the coecient ct determined by c in the trace anomaly (4.1). on the
other hand a, which is also initially dened in terms of (4.1), has no direct relation to c as
demonstrated by results for free elds.

it appears therefore that there may be some unresolved questions when applying the
operator product expansion on spaces with non zero curvature. for a conformal eld the-
ory on at space all one point functions vanish (except trivially for the identity operator).
for quasi-primary operators, which transform homogeneously under conformal transfor-
mations, two point functions, which are non zero only if both operators have the same
spin and scale dimension, are unique up to an overall constant and three point functions
are also given by a nite number of linearly independent forms. together these determine
completely the operator product expansions for any pair of quasi-primary operators in
terms of all quasi-primary operators and their descendents or derivatives for which the
associated three point functions are non zero and also the identity operator if their two

36

point function is non zero. if the operator product expansion is extended to a curved space
background the leading singular contributions to the coecient functions in the expansion
are of course determined by those for at space, but there may now be less singular con-
tributions involving the curvature which can naturally appear associated with derivative
terms. the contribution of the identity operator to the product of two operators may also
be expected in general now to be a function of the separation rather than just a power
determined by the scale dimension of the operators, since a non zero curvature introduces
a scale. moreover such a function cannot just be identied with the associated two point
function if other operators present in the expansion have a non zero expectation value on
curved space. in the particular case of the contribution of the energy momentum tensor to
the operator product expansion of two energy momentum tensors the coecient functions
found from at space calculations correspond to purely traceless energy momentum ten-
sors [31,32] so that the straightforward generalisation to curved space does not generate
terms associated with its expected trace anomaly. the necessity of a non zero trace for
hti on a general curved space for a at space conformal theory arises in d = 2, 4, . . .
dimensions as a consequence of the requirement that the regularisation procedure neces-
sary to determine hti should maintain the conservation equation (2.5), [33]. the trace
is then unambiguous, independent of boundary conditions and non zero. however, on a
homogeneous space of constant curvature, the conservation equation is trivially satised
as a consequence of (2.25). hence, as remarked in [26], there is no calculation uniquely
determining the anomaly, or the coecient c in (2.25), which is entirely intrinsic to the
theory on the constant curvature space (although calculations adapted to such spaces are
described in [34,26,35]).

when d = 4 the contribution of the energy momentum tensor, of dimension 4, to
the operator product expansion of two energy momentum tensors will in general mix with
terms quadratic in the riemann tensor and such terms will contribute to the two point
function. this may be illustrated by the associated example of the two point function of
the energy momentum tensor and the scalar eld o. (4.36) for the hyperbolic case gives
ujr2 +22hoji(cid:1) . (11.6)
(22)2ht (x)oi(y)i(cid:12)(cid:12)i=0 = 
j is the dimension matrix for the elds oj this is exactly in accord with (11.1) but
since i
the presence of a non zero uj in general demonstrates such a mixing with curvature terms.

12. unitary representations of o(d  1, 2) for spin one

in a quantum eld theory with a unique vacuum the correlation functions may be
expressed in terms of the vacuum state expectation values of products of local eld op-

37

erators. for unitarity the operators are assumed to act on a hilbert space with positive
norm. a further essential requirement is that there is a hermitian hamiltonian operator
h, which annihilates the vacuum but otherwise with positive spectrum, generating trans-
lations in a coordinate  . this ensures that the theory may be analytically continued, by
letting   it, from an underlying d-dimensional with positive metric to dene a unitary
quantum eld theory on the associated space with a metric with signature (, +, . . .). we
here consider eld theories on the homogeneous constant curvature spaces sd and h d. in
the positive curvature case the analytic continuation of sd, when  is periodic, leads to
de sitter space dsd and the correlation functions of the resulting quantum eld theory are
interpreted as corresponding to a thermal bath of non zero temperature [33], and so are
not given by vacuum matrix elements of eld operators.8 in consequence we restrict our
attention here to the negative curvature case when the homogeneous space h d is contin-
ued to adsd. hence we consider states which form unitary representations of the isometry
group o(d 1, 2) where the vacuum |0i is a unique state forming a trivial singlet represen-
tation. the general unitary positive energy representations are constructed from lowest
weight states which form a basis for a representation space for o(d  1). the representa-
tions are used subsequently to obtain spectral representations for the two point correlation
functions. for scalar elds the unitary representations are formed from a spin 0 or singlet
lowest weight state and the spectral representations are well known [19,6]. however the
extension to elds with spin involves further complications so in this section, and appendix
c, we construct in detail the representation for a spin one lowest weight state.

in order to identify convenient coordinates, with a privileged choice for  , for h d
we consider rst its embedding in rd+1 as the hypersurface given by the constraint
2gabab = 1 where with a = (0, i, d) we have g00 = gdd = 1, gij = ij.
global coordinates x = (, r, i) for h d are then given by 0 = sinh  sec r, i =
tan r i, d =  cosh  sec r, where ii = 1, i  sd2 and , r are in the ranges
 <  < , 0  r  
2 . on continuing   it these coordinates then cover the simply
connected covering space for adsd. the associated metric ds2 = gabdadb becomes

2ds2 = sec2 r(cid:0)d 2 + dr2 + sin2 r ds2

sd2(cid:1) .

the isometry group o(d, 1) generators lab = ab  ba obey the algebra

[lab, lcd] = gbc lad  gac lbd  gbd lac + gad lbc .

writing

h = l0d ,

li = l0i  ldi ,

8 for a relevant discussion see [36].

(12.1)

(12.2)

(12.3)

38

the algebra (12.2) decomposes as

[h, li] = li ,

[li, l+j] = 2ijh  2lij ,

[l+i, l+j] = [li, lj] = 0 ,

[lij, h] = 0 ,

[lij, lk] = jkli  iklj ,

(12.4)

with lij the generators of o(d  1) obeying an algebra of the same form as (12.2) with
gab  ij. with these coordinates we have

h = 




, li = e(cid:18)i(cid:16) sin r


  cos r

where di is the tangential derivative



r(cid:17)  cosec r di(cid:19) , lij = idj  jdi ,

(12.5)

[di, dj] = lij ,

idi = 0 ,

dij = ij  ij ,

(12.6)

so that we may write dj = ilij and also [lij, dk] = jkdi  ikdj .

in a quantum eld theory which is unitary on continuation to adsd the isometry
group is represented by operator generators lab obeying (12.2) which on decomposing as
in (12.3) obey the hermeticity properties

h  = h ,

li

 = l+i ,

lij

 =  lij .

(12.7)

these conditions correspond to restricting to unitary representations of the algebra of
o(d  1, 2). the vacuum state |0i of course satises lab|0i = 0, forming the trivial singlet
representation. the quadratic casimir has the form

c2 =  1

for a scalar eld (x) the action of the generators is simply

[ lab, ] = lab .

(12.10)

to determine the extension to vector elds we consider the transformation of a vector
eld aa() on rd+1 for which the corresponding action of the generators is [ lab, ac] =
labac  gacab + gbcaa. this may be reduced to a d-component eld on the embedded

39

hypersurface h d through the invariant constraint aaa() = 0. in terms of the coordinates
x = (, r, i) it is natural to consider instead the eld aa(x) where a = a0  ad and
ai = ai  ijaj is the component of ai tangential to sd2 so that iai = 0. using the
constraint to eliminate a the action of the generators then becomes, with h, li, lij
given by (12.5),

[ h, a] =  ha  a ,
[ lij, a] =  lija ,

[ h, ai] = hai ,

[ lij, ak] = lij ak  ikaj + jkai ,

(12.11)

and

[ li, a] =  lia ,
[ li, aj] =  liaj  e cosec r jai + (ij  ij)(cid:0)a  1
[ li, a] =  lia  2ai + i cosec r(cid:0)e a+  e a(cid:1) .
for a scalar eld () there is a corresponding vector aa = blab satisfying aaa = 0.
in the same fashion as previously when aa()  aa(x) on h d we may therefore dene
(x)(x) where explicitly in terms of the coordinates x =
the vector eld a(x) = ea
(, r, i)

2 cosec2 r(a  e2 a)(cid:1) ,

(12.12)

 = e(cid:0) cos r   sin rr) ,

i = cot r di .

(12.13)

similarly for a vector aa there is an associated scalar alabab which may be used to
dened the divergence a and which is then given by,

a = 1

2 cos r(cid:0)e  a+ + e  a(cid:1)
2 cot r(cid:0) cos rr + (d  3) cosec r(cid:1)(cid:0)e a+  e a(cid:1) + cot r diai .
 1

(12.14)

for scalar elds the appropriate representation is dened in terms of a spin-0 lowest

weight state |i, h|i=1, satisfying

h|i = |i ,

li|i = lij|i = 0 .

(12.15)

l+i

the representation space is then spanned by linear combinations of states of the form
ri|i. these may be decomposed into representations of o(d2) by using symmetric

qi
traceless rank  tensors ci1...i ,  = 1, 2, . . ., satisfying

ci1...i = c(i1...i) ,

ciii1...i2 = 0 ,

(12.16)

|n , ci = k+

n l+i1 . . . l+i|ici1...i ,

k+ = l+i l+i ,

n,  = 0, 1, 2, . . . .

(12.17)

40

it is easy to see that h|n , ci = ( + 2n + )|n , ci and for all states the casimir operator,
given by (12.8), takes the value (  d + 1) while for each  they transform irreducibly
under o(d  2). these states satisfy the orthogonality condition
c c = c

hn , c|n , ci = nn c c nn ,

i1...ici1...i ,

(12.18)

where, as shown in appendix c, the norms are

nn = 24n+n!!()n+( + )n( + 1  )n ,  = 1

2 (d  1) ,

()n =

( + n)

()

. (12.19)

a unitary representation therefore requires as usual  > 0,  1
2 (d 3) or  = 0 when there
is just the singlet vacuum state |0i. an complete orthogonal basis of states, {|n , ii}, of
the form given by (12.17) may be obtained by introducing for each  a basis of symmetric
traceless tensors ci
i1...i , satisfying (12.16), such that
ci 

i1...i = p ()

ci
j1...jci

 ci = i i , xi

j1...j,i1...i ,

(12.20)

where p () is here the projector onto symmetric traceless tensors of rank .

the action of l+i on the basis states (12.17) takes (n )  (n+1 1), (n +1). it is

convenient to dene the   1 rank symmetric traceless tensors

c+
i,i1...i+1 = i(i1ci2...i+1)

to obtain the spectral representation of the two point function of the scalar eld 
we need to determine the matrix elements of  between |0i and arbitrary states in the
representation. for the lowest weight state

h0|(x)|i = e f (r) ,

and li|i = 0 leads to, from (12.5), to cos rf (r) +  sin rf (r) = 0 so that

f (r) = n (cos r) .

(12.23)

(12.24)

a general matrix element has the form

h0|(x)|n , ci = en fn(r) y c

where we dene appropriate spherical harmonics (for further properties see appendix c, a

(12.26)

from (12.8), (12.9) and (12.10) with lab|0i = 0 it is easy to see that the matrix elements
(12.25) satisfy 2

reduced to a simple equation for fn. in order to nd fn with the overall scale determined

(12.30)

fn(0) = n (1)n22n()n()n 0 .

(12.31)

the above results are designed to set the scene for the more involved analysis when
spin is involved. for spin one we consider a lowest weight state |, ii, h, i|, ji = ij, with
(12.15) replaced by,

h|, ii = |, ii ,

li|, ii = 0 ,

lij|, ki = jk|, ii  ik|, ji .

(12.32)

42

in order to build a basis of states analogous to (12.17) it is necessary besides (12.16)
to introduce tensors cji1...i ,  = 1, 2, . . . belonging to mixed symmetry, described by
(, 1, 0 . . .) young tableaux, representations which satisfy the properties

cji1...i = cj(i1...i) ,

c(ji1...i) = 0 ,

cjji1...i1 = cjiii1...i2 = 0 .

(12.33)

corresponding to (12.17) we now dene the states,

|n  , ci = k+
|n  +, ci = k+
|n , ci = k+

n l+i1 . . . l+i1|, kicki1...i1 ,
l+k|, kici1...i ,

n,  = 0, 1, . . . ,

(12.34)

n = 0, 1, . . . ,  = 1, 2, . . . ,

with the associated eigenvalues of h taking the values,

n =  + 2n +   1 ,

n =  + 2n +  .

(12.35)

for  = 1, 2, . . . the scalar products of the states |n  , ci are described by a 2 2 matrix,

(cid:18)hn+1  , c|n+1  , ci
hn  +, c|n+1  , ci

hn+1  , c|n  +, ci
hn  +, c|n  +, ci (cid:19) = nn c c n n ,

(12.36)

while also

hn , c|n , ci = nn c c nn ,

hn 0 +, 1|n 0 +, 1i = nn nn+ .

c c = c

(12.37)

nn+ = 24n+2n!( + 1)n()n+1( + 1  )n(  d + 2) ,

(12.38)

so that unitarity requires   1, d  2. the expressions for the elements of n n are more
involved and so are deferred to appendix c.

in a similar fashion to (12.21) we dene

where c
i,ji1...i are mixed symmetry tensors satisfying (12.33) while ci,i1...i is a symmetric
tensor obeying (12.16). furthermore from ci1...i we may also dene a mixed symmetry
tensor satisfying (12.33) by

(12.41)

following a similar route to the case of scalar elds we consider now the matrix
elements of a vector current aa(x) between the singlet |0i and the states of this spin one
representation.9 for the lowest weight state we take, consistent with jaj = 0,

h0|a(x)|, ki = 0 ,
h0|aj(x)|, ki = (jk  jk)e f (r) .

h0|a+(x)|, ki = ke(+1) g(r) ,

(12.42)

imposing the equations following from li|, ki = 0, which also requires the vanishing of
the a matrix element, and using (12.5) we get

 sin rf + cos rf  = 0 ,

f + 1

2 cosec rg = 0 ,

( + 1)g + cos rg  cosec rg = 0 , (12.43)

for which the solution is

f (r) = n (cos r) ,

g(r) = 2n (cos r) sin r .

it is easy to verify from (12.14) that this solution implies10

h0|a|, ki = 0 .

(12.44)

(12.45)

9 in four dimensions the spin one representation was discussed by fronsdal [38] who obtained

equivalent results for h0|aa|, ki to those obtained below.

10 alternatively for a spin 0 lowest weight state we nd h0|a(x)|i = n e(1) (cos r)1,
h0|aj(x)|i = 0, h0|a+(x)|i = n e(+1) (cos r)1 cos 2r but in this case h0|aa(x)|i =
an e (cos r)/.
it is useful to also note that h0|a(x)|i = (  d + 1)n e (cos r)
so the current is conserved if  = d  1.

44

for other states the matrix elements may be determined in a similar fashion to previously.
to write expressions for matrix elements we need besides (12.26) vector spherical harmonics
which may be dened in terms of tensors satisfying (12.33),

y c
,j() = cji1...i i1 . . . i .
,j() = 0 and also we have djy c
 () this satises njy c

like dj y c

13. spectral representations

the spectral representation for two point functions encodes completely the analytic-
ity requirements following from locality for any quantum eld theory together with the

46

g() =

2

()

( + 1  )

ef (, ;  + 1  ; e2) .

(13.2)

conditions of unitarity which reduce to positivity of the spectral weight function. such
representations may also be found for spaces of constant curvature [19] although they are
signicantly less straightforward to determine in specic cases. for two dimensional eld
theories on at space the proof of the c-theorem may be recast with added insight in terms
of the spectral representation for the energy momentum tensor two point function [6]. it
is therefore natural to also consider the spectral representation for the energy momentum
tensor two point function on spaces of constant curvature.

for the scalar eld  we rst compute the two point function corresponding to sum-
ming over the intermediate states |n , ii labelled by  and for which the casimir operator
has the value ( d + 1). it is simplest to set r = 0 and then only  = 0 states contribute,
in a similar fashion to [6], and using (12.31) we have

h0|(, 0, )(0, 0, )|0i = xn=0

fn0(0)2
nn0

en0 = n 2e f (, ;  + 1  ; e2 ) .

(13.1)

for x = (, 0, ), y = (0, 0, ) we have  =  . with the appropriate choice for n 2 this is
the standard green function for 2 + (  d + 1)2, as veried in appendix b,

for the conformally coupled case the two choices of  are 1
ditions and 1
point function can then be written as

2 d for dirichlet boundary con-
2 (d 2) for the neumann case. the spectral representation for the scalar two

h(x)(y)i = z 

1

2 (d3)

d () g() .

(13.3)

in a similar fashion to the discussion of the scalar two point function in (13.1) we
may now determine the contribution of a single spin 1 irreducible representation to the
vector two point function. choosing the same conguration as previously the non zero
components are

h0|a(, 0, )a(0, 0, )|0i = h0|a(, 0, )a(0, 0, )|0i = e d( ) ,
h0|aj(, 0, )ak(0, 0, )|0i = (jk  jk)e( ) .

using the results (12.55) with (12.38) then (13.1) adapted to this case gives

d( ) = xn=0

(cid:0)g

e( ) = e xn=0

ane2n ,

where

a0 = n 2 ,

an+1 = ( fn+1 1 (0)

n1 (cid:18) fn+1 1 (0)

(13.6)

(13.7)

(13.8)

(13.9)

the functions d and e are constrained by conservation equations. to obtain these
and to show the relation to the general formalism used in section 8 we may write in general
for the correlation function of two vector currents

ha(x)a(y)i = x y d() + (i + x y) e() .

(13.10)

choosing, as in (13.4), x = (, 0, ), y = (0, 0, ), when  =  , then the non zero compo-
nents of x, y are just x = 1, y = 1 and also we have i  = 1. using (12.13) for these
a gives
x, y to obtain the equivalent results in the basis used in (13.4) given by aa = ea
then

x = e ,

y = 1 ,

i = i = e ,

iij = ij  ij .

(13.11)

applying (13.11) in (13.10) then leads to identical expressions for each components as in
(13.4) where d, e are given by just the single spin one irreducible representation specied
by . the conservation equation ha(x)a(y)i = 0 using the results in section 5 is
easily seen to give

sinh  d() + (d  1) cosh  d() = (d  1) e() .

(13.12)

it is straightforward to check that this is satised by (13.5) and (13.9). by extension of
(13.2) we dene

g,n() =

d2+2n

2

( + n)
( + 1  )

e(+n)f ( + n,  + n;  + 1  ; e2) ,

(13.13)

48

and then the representation for a general vector two point function may then be obtained
by expressing d as, if d > 3,

d() = z 

d v () g,1() ,
d2

(13.14)

where v () is a positive weight function, with e determined by (13.12).

it is of interest to consider separately the contribution from  = d  2 when we have

d0() = c gd2,1() = c

d
2sd

cosh 
(sinh )d ,

e0() =

c
d  1

d
2sd (sinh )d .

(13.15)

with these expressions the vector two point function (13.10) may be written just in terms
of the scalar gs

ha(x)a(y)is = gs()  ,

where

gs () = c

d  2
(d  1)2 gd1() .

(13.16)

(13.17)

thus gs is proportional to the scalar green function, as given by (13.2), for  = d1 which
since then 2gs() = 0 for x 6= y ensures that (13.16) satises the conservation equation.
in this special case the contribution of the spin one representation intermediate states is
therefore identical with those of spin zero. this is in accord with the representation theory
since, if  = d2 as may be seen in (c.7), the states {|n 0 +, ci} span an invariant subspace
with |0 0 +, 1i = l+k|, ki, annihilated by li, the lowest weight state. this representation
formed by this subspace is identical with a spin zero representation corresponding to  =
d  1. summing over intermediate states in this space gives just the result (13.16) with
(13.17).

our primary interest here is of course the energy momentum tensor two point function.
the unitary representation of the isometry group o(d  1, 2) for a spin two lowest weight
state, |, iji = |, jii, |, iii = 0 which satises analogous conditions to (12.32), may in
principle be constructed along similar lines to the spin one case considered above and in
appendix c, but this would be tedious to carry out. the norm of the state l+j|, iji
is proportional to   d + 1 so for unitarity it is necessary that   d  1 in this case.
although we do not here undertake the detailed relevant calculations the results for spin
one nevertheless suggest a natural conjecture for the contribution of the representation
built on the lowest weight state |, iji to the energy momentum tensor two point function.

49

to describe this we rst decompose the bi-tensor ,(x, y) given by (8.4), with (8.5),
for x = (, 0, ), y = (0, 0, ) in the basis given by (13.11) when we obtain

, = e2 (r  4s + 2t + 2u + v ) ,
j,l = e jl(s  t ) ,
ij,kl = (cid:0)ik jl + il jk(cid:1)t + ij klv ,

ij = ij  ij ,

ij, = ij (u + v ) ,

(13.18)

and other components are trivially related to those in (13.18). with the denitions (8.10)
and (8.6) we have

r  4s + 2t + 2u + v =

d  1
d

q +

2d  1

d

p1 +

1
d

p2 .

(13.19)

the conservation equations (a.2) demonstrate that , determines the other compo-
nents, assuming the traceless conditions (8.6), just like d determines e in (13.12) for the
vector current two point function.

based on analogy with (13.14) we conjecture the spectral representation for spin 2
intermediate states can therefore be written for q in the form, with the denition (13.13),

q() = sdz 

d 2() g,2() .
d1

(13.20)

of course, by virtue of the conservation equations, this determines the spectral represen-
tation for the whole energy momentum tensor two point function since for intermediate
spin 2 states it is automatically traceless. the general conserved energy momentum tensor
two point function, as given by (2.27), can then be expressed as in (8.28),

s 2
d ht (x)t(y)icon = 0,,(x, y) + 2,,(x, y) ,

(13.21)

where the spin 0 piece is determined by f0(),

0,,(x, y) = (cid:0)  g2 + (d  1)2g(cid:1)f0()(cid:0)   2g + (d  1)2g(cid:1) ,

(13.22)
and the spin 2 piece is traceless and may be written as in (8.20) in terms of f2(). since
q determines 2,, (13.20) implies therefore a spectral representation for the spin 2
part of ht (x)t(y)i determined by the positive weight function 2(). equivalently by
integrating (a.10) with q given by (13.20) a spectral representation for f2 may be found.
the spectral representation for the spin 0 part 0,, is also obtained directly by writing
a representation analogous to (13.3) for f0,

f0() = sdz 

0

d 0() g() ,

50

(13.23)

where 0 is in general restricted just by the unitarity bound 0 > 1

2 (d3) if d > 3. in [6] it
is suggested that 0 = d in order to ensure that r ddxg gt is well dened, in the co-
ordinates corresponding to the metric in (12.1), when gh d = (cos r)d(sin r)d2gsd2,
as x approaches the boundary r = 
2 , e  2 cosh  / cos r. directly from (13.22) we have
(13.24)

s 2
d g(x)g(y)ht(x)t(y)icon = (d  1)2(2 + d2)2f0() ,

and since for x 6= y this is identical with h(x)(y)i we must have, neglecting possible
subtractions,

sdh(x)(y)i = z 

0

d () g() ,

4(d  1)2( + 1)2(  d)20() = () . (13.25)

so that this determines 0() in terms of () except for  = d. as an illustrative
example we consider free massive scalars in appendix d. however, although (13.22) is
valid in general for  > 0, it may be extended to give a well dened distribution, for test
functions non zero at x = y, only if, for large , 0() = o() with  < 1. assuming
(13.23) and (13.24) we have, if 0  d,

g0 = sd

if 0 > d 1. clearly this depends on the subtraction constant g0, for which there is then
no necessary positivity constraint, as well as 0(). in (13.25) it is necessary to require
 < 1 is subtractions are to be avoided.
in four dimensions the expected behaviour
in renormalisable eld theories away from xed points is  = 1, apart from powers of
ln , so that it is then necessary to use (13.27). of course unless there is a well dened
representation for h(x)(y)i such as given by (13.24) and (13.27) relations involving local
contact terms like (2.13) are without signicance.

an important role is played by the contribution to f0() for  = d for which
in this case, following (9.1)

0,,(x, y) satises the traceless conditions for x 6= y.
since k0 = sdgd,

0() = c0d2(  d)  f0() = c0d2 sdgd() ,

(13.28)

51

leads to a form for 0,, which may be expressed in terms of the result calculated in
(9.14) for q0. from the denition of g,2 in (13.13) we have

q0() = 4d(d + 1)c0d2 sdgd2,2() .

(13.29)

this result shows exact agreement with the contribution expected from a spin 2 repre-
sentation, as in (13.20), for  = d  2. although this is outside the unitarity bound it
corresponds to the invariant subspace present for this value of  and which may be con-
structed from the spin zero lowest weight state l+k l+l|, kli, which is then annihilated
by li.

if we assume the minimal form given by (10.10) for conformally invariant theories we

nd

q()conformal = ct(cid:16) 1

sd +

1

sd(cid:17) = ct 2d ed(cid:0)(1  e)2d + (1 + e)2d(cid:1) .

(13.30)

the spectral representation (13.20) can be written in this case in the form

q()conformal = 2ct 2dxr=0

ar e(d+2r)f(cid:0)d + 2r,  + 2;  + 2r; e2(cid:1) .

(13.31)

by expanding both (13.30) and (13.31) in powers of e2 we nd, by matching the rst
ten terms,

a0 = 1 ,

ar = 2

(d)2r(d  2)2r1
(2r)!()2r1

, r = 1, 2, . . . .

(13.32)

for d = 3, when ar = 2(r + 1)(2r + 1) if r > 0, the hypergeometric functions may be
reduced to elementary functions and the summation carried out explicitly. as required
ar > 0 for d > 2 and ar = 0 if r > 0 and d = 2. for r > 0 the coecients ar determine
the appropriate 2() in (13.20) while from (13.29) we must have11

2d1d(d + 1)(d  1)c0 = ct .

(13.33)

the remaining contribution is then given by taking

11 the coecient c0 was calculated directly in [6] for free scalar elds with exact agreement,

with due regard for conventions, with this result.

52

for scalar elds the simple form given by (10.10), and hence (13.30), is not the whole
story in the conformal limit. the extra terms present in (10.9) inserted into (8.10) give,
writing q() = q()conformal + q1() with ct given by (10.6),

q1() = 4ct, d

(d  2)(d + 1)

(13.35)

this corresponds to the contribution with only  = d in the spectral representation. added
to (13.31), and using the result (13.32), leads just to the cancellation of the term involving
a1 = 2d(d + 1)(d  2)/(d  1). in particular the coecient a0 is unaected.

in general c0 determines the leading large distance behaviour of the energy momentum
tensor two point function while ct is related to its singular form at short distances. it is
unclear whether the relation (13.33) survives in interacting conformal eld theories.

14. implications for a possible c-theorem in four dimensions

the initial stimulus for this paper was to investigate the possibility of deriving a c-
theorem by considering one and two point functions of the energy momentum tensor on
spaces of constant curvature. within the framework described here this does not seem
to be feasible. a possible c-function need not necessarily reproduce all the attractive
features uncovered by zamolodchikov in two dimensions [2] but may satisfy some or all
the following properties:

1) c(; g) should be a physically measurable positive function of the couplings gi and
some length scale  such that at a xed point, i(g) = 0, c(; g) = c is independent
of  and unambiguously and universally dened in terms of the properties of the conformal
eld theory which is obtained at the xed point. the minimal condition of irreversibility
of rg ow is that for a unitary quantum eld theory in which there are both u v and ir
xed points we require

c(u v )  c(ir) > 0 .

(14.1)

ideally c(; g) should be a function of the couplings for all relevant and irrelevant opera-
tors in the space of cut-o quantum eld theories since its essential denition is independent
of perturbation theory, c = 0 should correspond to a totally trivial theory with no nite
energy degrees of freedom. it may, although this does not seem essential, be independent
of any strictly marginal couplings whose -functions vanish.12 the c function should be

12 in this case c is just a constant equal to its free eld value in n = 4 sym.

53

extensive so that if {g} can be separated into two distinct sets {g1}, {g2} corresponding to
two decoupled theories then

c(; g) = c1(; g1) + c2(; g2) .

(14.2)

2) the c-function should obey the usual rg equation expressing its independence of the
arbitrary rg scale 

(cid:18)




+ i 

gi(cid:19)c(; g) = 0 .

(14.3)

irreversibility of rg ow, at least in some nite domain of couplings {g} near a xed point,
is then entailed by the requirement






c(; g)(cid:26) < 0 on {g} \ g ,

= 0 if g = g .

(14.4)

with these conditions c denes a liapunov function in the region {g} for the rg ow

c(; gt) < 0 if

gt 6= g ,

gi
t = i(gt) .

3) a natural condition which clearly entails (14.4) is to require






c(; g) = gij (; g)i(g)j(g) ,

(14.5)

(14.6)

where gij (; g) is independently dened as a positive symmetric tensor on the space of
couplings and can be regarded as playing the role of a metric. gij (; g) should satisfy a
homogeneous rg equation,






gij (; g)+(lg)ij(; g) = 0 ,

(l g)ij = iigij +ikgkj +j kgik , (14.7)

where ij is the anomalous dimension matrix for the operators oj. trivially from (14.3)
and (14.6) we have the essential zamolodchikov equation,

i(g)


gi

c(; g) = gij(; g)i(g)j(g) .

(14.8)

4) assuming (14.8) the denition of c is still ambiguous to the extent that

c(; g)  c(; g) = c(; g) + dij(; g)i(g)j(g) ,

gij(; g)  gij(; g) = gij (; g) + (ld)ij (; g) ,

(14.9)

54

leaves (14.8) invariant. this denes an equivalence amongst c-functions and associated
metrics which ensures that the precise value of  chosen in (14.8) is irrelevant but of course
all such functions give the same value c at a xed point. to ensure the desired properties
of irreversible rg ow it is only necessary that there is a dij such that gij is positive.13
introducing the correct terms linear in i, as in (3.8), are in general necessary to nd a c
satisfying (14.8) although they also do not change c.

5) a stronger condition, analogous to (3.9), which implies (14.8) is

ic(; g) = tij(; g)j(g) ,

tij = gij + iwj  jwi .

(14.10)

if t[ij] = 0 this ensures that the rg ow is a gradient ow. in general (14.10) shows that
c is independent of marginal coupling if tij has no o diagonal pieces. under variations
as in (14.9) then (14.10) still holds if at the same time

wj(; g) = wj(; g) + djk(; g)k(g) ,

(14.11)

which demonstrates that wj cannot be zero in general and that the assumed form for t[ij]
in (14.10) is consistent.

to illustrate some aspects of the above we rst attempt to rederive the zamolodchikov
c-theorem [2] (for a recapitulation see [39]). the basic inequality is similarly obtained using
previous results applied to the two point function of the energy momentum tensor in two
dimensions on s2 ht (x)t(y)i = ,(x, y) as in (8.4). the positivity condition is
provided by gght (x)t(y)i = p1 + 2p2  0. using (8.12a) and (8.9) for d = 2 we
require

4c() = 2 sin4 1

2 (r + p1) + f ()(p1 + p2) ,

to satisfy

4c() = 1

2 f ()(p1 + 2p2) .

this provides a dierential equation for f which is readily solved,

f () = 4 sin4 1

2  + 4 sin2  ln cos 1

2  .

(14.14)

as   0 f ()   3
4 4 so that f () < 0 for some nite region near  = 0 (f () < 0
for  . 2.5) in which then c() < 0. nevertheless c is in general a function of the
dimensionless / as well as  and the couplings gi and the  derivative is not linked

13 in a perturbative context [21] we may obtain c(; g) = c(g) + ij(; g)i(g)j(g),
 ij + (l)ij = gij. the

gij(; g) = gij(g) + (l)ij(; g) where iic = gijij and  
perturbative gij need not be positive although gij is.

55

to the dependence on the rg scale . hence there appears to be no demonstration of
irreversibility of rg ow for general  from such an inequality. only with the assumption
of a sensible at space limit which requires c()  c(/) as   0 may such a result
be obtained. in this case the resulting c-function, which satises (14.6) as well as (14.3)
with  = s = /, is equivalent to that found by zamolodchikov.14

more recently [10] an alternative derivation of a c-theorem for general d in terms of
quantum eld theories on spaces of constant negative curvature, where the c-function c
is dened by ghti = cd, has been suggested which is based on equations akin to
(2.29a, b). dening

(2.29a) may be written, using (13.26), as

c = sdc ,



d
d

c = g0  d c ,

(14.15)

(14.16)

where, if the unsubtracted representation (13.23) is valid, (13.26) implies that g0 > 0. if
we assume a  d, as in sections three and four for both two and four dimensions, then
from (2.31) we have

i 
gi

c = 

d
d

c .

(14.17)

in this case the right hand side of (14.16) must vanish for i = 0. this becomes more
apparent by using (2.29b) to now write

ii c = g 

1

d sdi(cid:0)ia + ijhoji(cid:1) , g =

1

d sdz ddyg h(x)(y)i .

(14.18)

in [10] the additional terms beyond g, which is o(2), are missing (there is no discernible
redenition of c which achieves this). as it stands, given the denition of c, (14.18) is just
an identity. if these additional terms (14.18) are disregarded then taking c(/, g), which
satises (14.3) with  = 1/, as a possible c-function hinges on supposing g > 0 in order
to obtain the essential inequality (14.6). for x 6= y in unitary theories h(x)(y)i > 0.
however the regularisation of potential singularities in the integration dening g at x = y
is much less clear.15 it is important to recognise that g may be dened as a nite quantity
14 to make the comparison clear, using a similar notation to that in [39], we may dene

f = 1
(14.12), for g(s) = 1 + (1  1
h(s) = 1 + (1  1
identical with the standard at space result.

4 2s) satises sc (s) =  1

2 2s)/ 1

4 2s ln(1  1

15 the prescription in [10] of subtracting -function contact terms is not unambiguous and
does not provide a well dened regularisation in general. introducing additional couplings into

the quantum eld theory involving curvature terms does not change the essential argument.

56

through (14.18) but the regularisation of the integral need not preserve any positivity
conditions. these also do not apply to contact terms that may be present in h(x)(y)i
(and which may be arbitrary although any such ambiguity cancels on both sides of (14.18)).
in general g depends on possible subtraction constants in the spectral representation of
the two point function whose positivity need not be entailed by that of the spectral weight
function.

a perhaps convincing argument as to the essential diculties of such an approach,
independent of intricacies of the precise denition of g, is that in four dimensions (4.35)
shows that we expect c > 0 for either positive or negative curvature, and at a xed point
it is equal to a up to a factor, and then g > 0 would be sucient to prove the desired
c-theorem for c implying (14.1), so long as the other terms on the r.h.s of (14.18) are
neglected. however in two dimensions from (3.21) c has no denite sign although it is
proportional to the virasoro central charge c at a xed point. in particular for the positive
curvature case c < 0 and then g > 0 would be the wrong sign inequality to generate the
required irreversible rg ow. it is nevertheless dicult to see why any putative derivation
along these lines should not apply for both positive and negative curvature.

it is worth emphasising that considering a eld theory on a space of constant non
zero curvature of course introduces an extra scale, here denoted by . this complicates
the discussion of physical consequences from the rg equations except in some at space
limit as became apparent in the attempt to generalise the zamolodchikov derivation of
the c-theorem. another way of appreciating the dierence is that on at space the rg
equation may be regarded as implementing broken scale invariance identities. on at
space the full conformal group o(d + 1, 1) is reduced, except at xed points, to o(d)  td.
the broken generators decompose under o(d) into singlet generating scale transformations
and a d-dimensional vector corresponding to special conformal transformations. the scale
invariance ward identities may still be implemented in a quantum eld theory away from
xed points if they are associated with a ow in the space of couplings generated by the
usual -functions. although such linear equations for the correlation functions do not
involve any arbitrary scale  they are equivalent to the standard rg equations. there
are corresponding identities relevant for special conformal transformations [40] but these
involve the insertion of operators which are not generated by derivatives with respect to
the couplings.
in the absence of closed equations such identities are not then of much
practical signicance. if a quantum eld theory is dened on sd or h d, as considered in
this paper, then the manifest symmetry group is o(d + 1) or o(d, 1). in either case the
remaining generators of o(d + 1, 1) transform as a d + 1-dimensional vector. the broken
conformal identities are then similar to those for special conformal transformations on at
space and there are no associated linear equations relating directly the x-dependence and

57

the dependence on the couplings through the -functions.

although, as illustrated in (7.15), (10.2), (10.12), and (10.5), with (10.6), (10.13),
(10.18), the results for free eld theories on sd are in accord with expectation from con-
formal invariance, using (6.17), (6.25) and (7.13), this does not apply to the corresponding
results on h d. this arises since in order to derive the identities expressing conformal sym-
metry it is necessary to integrate by parts and surface terms on the boundary cannot be
dropped due to lack of sucient fall o of the killing vector elds as the boundary of h d
is approached. in consequence the results are less constrained in this case.

in the end the analysis of the energy momentum tensor on spaces of constant curvature
has not apparently led to new insight concerning a proof of a possible c-theorem away
from two dimensions. nevertheless we have rederived (4.22) which is the four dimensional
analogue of (3.7) in two dimensions which then gave (3.9), a perturbative analogue of the
c-theorem. this result can be shown to be directly connected with the full c-function
which entails irreversible rg ow [21]. the result (4.22) may be expected to be related to
similar equations involving three point functions at non coincident points. in such cases
positivity is no longer manifest but might be linked to positivity conditions on the energy
momentum tensor [41]. it is interesting to note that a recent demonstration of irreversible
rg ow in an ads/cft context depended on a positive energy condition [14], albeit for
classical supergravity.

in two dimensions if we modify the discussion in (14.12), (14.13) and (14.14) to the

negative curvature case instead of (14.12) we may dene

4c() = 2 sinh4 1

(a.12)

in this case f () < 0 for all  and c() is monotonically decreasing.

appendix b. construction of green functions

we here discuss the various green functions for particular dierential operators which
were used in the text. for homogeneous spaces of constant curvature these all depend just
on the single variable (x, y) and the dierential equations for sd or h d are similar although
the regularity or boundary conditions in each case lead to dierent solutions.

60

first we determine the green function g() for the operator 2  (  d + 1)2
for r  0. for the negative curvature case, writing g() = eh(e2), then
(2 + (  d + 1)2)g0() = 0 gives using (5.16),
z(1 z)h (z) +(cid:0)( + 1)(1 z) (1 z)(cid:1)h (z) h(z) = 0 ,
2 (d 1) , (b.1)
which is of standard hypergeometric form. imposing boundedness as    requires the
solution  f (, ;  + 1  ; z). for g() to be a green function it must have the
singular behaviour as as   0, g()  (/)d+2/sd(d  2), so as to generate d(x, y)
under the action of 2. it is easy to see that this gives the result (13.2). for  = d we
have for the green function k0 dened by (3.13) and (4.26) when d = 2 and d = 4,

k0() = sdgd() = d2 2d

ha(x)a(y)i = gd(x, y) .

(b.10)

to solve this we adapt the methods of ref. [29] to our notation. using the denition (6.26)
we may write

(b.11)

(b.12)

(b.13)

(b.14)

(b.15)

and, since as a consequence of (6.27) [

ha(x)a(y)i = f () i + h()  ,
i] = 0, we then have

hf (x)a(y)i = f ()(xi  x i) .

in order to solve (b.10) we rst require

this decomposes into two equations in either case

hf (x)a(y)i = gd(x, y) + (cid:0)s()y(cid:1) .

s+ = sin 2f+  2 cos f 
+ ,
s = sinh 2f  2 cosh f

 = 2(d  1) cosech f

 ,

which may be satised, along with (b.13), by imposing

2f ()  (d  2)2f () = d(x, y) .

this is identical to the equation for the scalar green function for  = d  2 so that from
the above solutions we have (for r > 0 the result is essentially given in [42])
f ()+ = d2 (d  2)

case,

(b.17)

with a similar equation if r < 0, although knowing h is unnecessary to obtain (10.12)
when in addition we use f (2, 1; 2; w) = (1  w)1.

appendix c. calculation of norms and spherical harmonics

the calculation of the norms of the basis states dened in (12.17) or (12.34) for the
scalar or vector representations follows from computing the action of li on these states.
in the standard fashion we use the basic commutator [ li, l+j] = 2ij h  2 lij, as well
as those involving h, lij with l+j, until they act on the lowest weight state and we may
use (12.15) or (12.32). for the scalar case, with the aid of,

[ li, k+] = 4 l+i( h   + 1)  2 l+j lij ,

 = 1

2 (d  1) ,

(c.1)

we nd

li|n , ci = 4n(   + n) l+i|n1 ,ci + 2( + 2n +   1)|n 1, c

(c.2)

after using (12.22). with the scalar products in (12.18) and using the hermeticity condi-
tions (12.7) with (c.2) and (12.22) again we have

hn1 +1, c| li|n , ci = 4n(   + n)nn1 +1 c c+

i =

 + 1
2( + ) nn c

i c ,

(c.3)

where

c c+

i = c

i c = c

ii1...ici1...i .

(c.4)

hence (c.3) gives relation between nn1 +1 and nn. similarly
hn 1, c| li|n , ci =

2

 +   1

( + n +   1)( + n +   1)nn 1 c c

i c ,
(c.5)
i c in this case, relates nn 1 and nn. solving the recurrence relations

i = nn c+

with c c
given by (c.3) and (c.5), with n00 = 1, then gives (12.19).

i = c+

for the vector case the results may be obtained in an analogous fashion albeit the

expressions are more lengthy. for the states dened in (12.34) we have

li|n , ci = 4n(   + n) l+i|n1 , ci + 4n|n1  +, cii + 2 |n  +, cii

(c.8)

with these formulae we may nd the norms of the basis vectors dened in (12.36) and
(12.37) by following the same procedure as in the spinless case. first for nn we obtain

hn1 +1, c| li|n , ci = 4n(   + n) nn1 +1 c c+

i =



2( + )

nn c

i c ,

(c.9)

and

hn 1, c| li|n , ci =

2(  1)
 +   1

( + n +   1)( + n +   1) nn 1 c c

i = nn c+

i c ,
(c.10)

by using (c.6) and (12.41). in (c.9) we have the relation

c c+

i =



 + 1

c

i c = c

ji1...iici1...i ,

(c.11)

and similarly in (c.10) with     1. thus nn obeys identical recurrence relations to
nn and (12.38) is obtained starting from n01 = 2(  1).

64

the 2  2 matrix n n dened by (12.36) may now be obtained directly with the aid
algebraic relations expressing each element in terms of nn. using (c.8) and (c.7) we may
nd, with an obvious notation for the components of n n,

hn , c| li|n+1  , ci = 4(n + 1)(   + n +  + 1) nn c ci
d +   3(cid:0)nn +  nn (cid:1) ci c ,

hn , c| li|n  +, ci =  2(  d + 2) nn  c ci

=

1

=

d +   3(cid:0)nn ++  nn +(cid:1) ci c ,

where

furthermore we have using (c.6)

ci c =  c ci = cii1...ici1...i .

hn  +, c| li|n+1 , ci = 0

=

d +   3(cid:16)2(n + 1)( +  + n +   1)nn ++

(cid:0)2( + n)( + n) + ( + 2n + 1)(cid:1)nn +(cid:17)c ci .

(c.12)

(c.13)

(c.14)

although a further relation may be obtained by considering hn+1  , c| li|n+1 , ci
(c.12) with (c.13) and (c.14), since nn + = nn +, are sucient to determine n n.
writing

n n = 24n++1n!(  1)!( + 1)n+1( + )n( + 1  )n (cid:18) a b

(c.15)

we then nd

b = 2(n + 1)( +  + n +   1)(  d + 2) ,
c = (cid:0)2( + n)( + n) + ( + 2n + 1)(cid:1)(  d + 2) .

(c.16)

the result for nn+ in (12.38) may be obtained by the result for nn ++ given by (c.15)
1 it is useful to note
and (c.16) by setting  = 0. since we require an expression for n n

appendix d. results for free massive scalar fields

forte and latorre [10] have discussed the case of free massive scalar elds on a space
of constant negative curvature. we here re-examine this case, which despite being a free
eld theory is non trivial, in the light of the main discussion in this paper.

for  a free scalar eld satisfying ( + m2) = 0 then if

m2 = (  1

2 d)(  1

2 d + 1)2 ,

(d.1)

the basic  two point function is g (). for such free massive elds the energy momentum
tensor may still be taken to be given by (10.1) but this is no longer traceless giving

 = m22 .

(d.2)

in terms of the general formalism set up earlier m2 may be regarded as a coupling with
the associated operator om2 = 1

2 2 and m2

= 2m2.

in order to determine the spectral representation for 2 in this case we make use of

f (1, ;1 + 1  ; e2)f (2, ; 2 + 1  ; e2)

=xn=0

b12,ne2nf (1 + 2 + 2n, ; 1 + 2 + 1   + 2n; e2) ,

66

(d.3)

where, in a similar fashion to (13.32),

b12,n =

(1)n(2)n

(1 + 1  )n(2 + 1  )n

()n(1 + 2 + 1  2 + n)n

n!(1 + 2 + n  )n

.

(d.4)

for d = 3, b12,n = 1, when (d.3) is easily checked. for the free eld  we therefore have

h2(x)2(y)i = 2g ()2 = z 

2

d 2 () g() ,

(d.5)

where from (d.3)

d2

2d1(d  1)2(d + 1)
2 d or   1

(  d) , (d.7)

where the limit m2  0 may be taken either by   1
2 d  1 in (d.1).
comparing with (13.28) the result for c0 is in agreement with (13.33) where ct is given
by (10.6).

for general d, g() may be separated, by using standard hypergeometric identities,
into two pieces one of which contains terms of the form d+2+2n, n = 0, 1, 2, . . ., and the
other which is analytic in . discarding the former we may easily obtain using (10.1)

h2i =

d2
(4) 1
2 d

(1  1

2 d)

()

( + 2  d)

,

hti =

d

m2gh2i .

(d.8)

the result for hti is of course as expected from (d.2). with the expression in (d.8) for
h2i we have, noting that (x) = (x)/(x),


m2 h2i =  h2i

()  ( + 2  d)

(  d + 1)2 .

(d.9)

the representation in terms of 2 may be veried directly for d = 3 and is convergent for
d < 4 when it demonstrates h2i/m2 < 0. for d = 2 (d.9) gives

2z d2yg h2(x)2(y)i =

(d.10)

as expected the one point functions in (d.8) are divergent when d = 2, 4. subtracting

the poles at d = 2, 4 as usual we have

2h2ireg(cid:12)(cid:12)d=2 =  ln
82h2ireg(cid:12)(cid:12)d=4 = m2(cid:16) ln


  ()  r ,




+ (  1) + r(cid:17) + 2s ,

(d.11)

where  is a regularisation scale and r, which may be absorbed into the denition of ,
and s are arbitrary parameters reecting the precise choice of renormalisation scheme (to
obtain the result for d = 4 it is essential to subtract a pole term  m2/,  = 4  d, where
m2 is given by (d.1) including o() terms). the ln / terms reect the mixing of the
operator 2 with 1, m21 for d = 2, 4 respectively. by using (2.30) we may obtain c/m2
in terms of h2ireg and integrating this gives

ghti =  cd = m2h2ireg + a ,
2a(cid:12)(cid:12)d=2 =  1

2 m2  1

6 c2 ,

22a(cid:12)(cid:12)d=4 = 1

2 m4  3a4 .

(d.12)

the free parameters r, for d = 2, and r, s, for d = 4, correspond to the potential freedom

of adding to the action terms of the form r d2xgm2 and r d4xgm4, r d4xgm2r

respectively. the undetermined integration constants c, a in (d.12), which are independent
of m2, cannot be so modied and are therefore renormalisation scheme independent. the
ln / terms demonstrate the mixing of t with gm2, gm4 for d = 2, 4 (even for free
theories and dening the energy momentum tensor through normal ordering for instance
there are such terms if the mass used to dene normal ordering is varied from the physical
m).

forte and latorre eectively choose r, s, as well as , by imposing the natural de-
coupling condition that hti, and also h2i, should vanish as m2  .16 this further
determines the integration constants c, a. with c dened by (14.15) and using the expan-
sion of (x) for large x, the decoupling condition leads to

68

these results for c, a determine c in the conformal limit m2  0 and are just as expected
for free scalar theories in 2, 4 dimensions. this prescription also ensures that a is indepen-
dent of m2, in contrast to (d.12). both results for cf l decrease monotonically to zero as
m2 increases from 0 to .17 for d = 2 the result for the m2 derivative can be expressed,
in agreement with (14.16) and (14.17), as

2m2

the  integral, with 0 given by (d.7), (d.6) and (d.4) for d = 2, may be veried numer-

ically and in special cases analytically. g0 is equal to 22m4r d2ygh2(x)2(y)i with

the o(m2) and o(1) terms at large m2 subtracted. for d = 4 the corresponding result is
again in accord with the general expression given by (14.16) and (14.17),

2m2

cf l = 4 cf l + g0 ,

. (d.18)

the additional constant present in (d.18) in the expression for g0 beyond that given
by (13.26) in terms of the integral over 0() is necessary since the right hand sides of
(d.15),(d.17) should vanish as m2  0 while the integral in this limit is restricted to
 = d, according to (d.7), and is determined by c0  ct  c while in four dimensions
cf l  a. from (13.26) and (d.7) we would have g0|m2=0 = d/(2d1(d + 1)).

2 p 1

17 for r > 0 a similar approach gives for d = 2, 4h2i = ln m2/2  (+)  ()
3 2/m2 + (+) + ()) where in both cases
and for d = 4, 162h2i = m2( ln m2/2 + 1
4  m2/2. by integrating (2.30) with the boundary condition that c vanishes as
 = 1
m2   we get for d = 2, c = m22h2i/2  1
120 . the
integration constants are just those expected from the trace anomaly. when d = 2 c decreases
monotonically with increasing m2, despite the sign of the anomaly in this case, as a consequence of
the result 4h2i  2/m2 as m2  0 with the singularity arising from the existence of constant
normalisable zero modes for 2 on a sphere. when d = 4 c changes sign at m2  0.22 before
tending to zero.

6 and for d = 4, c = m222h2i/4 + 1
