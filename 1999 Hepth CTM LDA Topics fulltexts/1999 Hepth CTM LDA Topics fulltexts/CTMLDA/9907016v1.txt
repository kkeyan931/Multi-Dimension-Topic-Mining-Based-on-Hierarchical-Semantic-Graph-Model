ultra-violet behavior of bosonic quantum

membranes

abstract

we treat the action for a bosonic membrane as a sigma model, and then
compute quantum corrections by integrating out higher membrane modes. as
in string theory, where the equations of motion of einsteins theory emerges
by setting  = 0, we nd that, with certain assumptions, we can recover the
equations of motion for the background elds, i.e. r + (1/4)ff 
 = 0
and df = 0. for the membrane case. although the membrane theory is
non-renormalizable on the world volume by power counting, the investigation
of the ultra-violet behavior of membranes may give us insight into the super-
symmetric case, where we hope to obtain higher order m-theory corrections
to 11 dimensional supergravity.

1 introduction

at present, little is known about the action for m-theory [1,2], other than that
it contains 11 dimensional supergravity in the low energy limit. higher order
corrections to 11d supergravity [3] are unknown. in this series of papers, we
hope to compute these higher order corrections.

in string theory, the usual 10d supergravity action is derived by treating
the original string action as a sigma model and them integrating the higher

1

modes. by setting  = 0 via conformal invariance, we then obtain the equa-
tions of motion of 10d supergravity, plus higher order corrections to any order
[4].

we would like to apply this same general technique to m-theory, treating
the 11d supermembrane action [5] as a sigma model in order to compute the
higher order corrections to m-theory. there are, of course, several obstacles
to performing such a procedure.

first, by power counting, the membrane theory in higher dimensions is non-
renormalizable on the world volume. we nd that the degree of divergence
for any n-point function can be made arbitrarily high by adding higher vertex
corrections, thereby rending invalid the standard renormalization technique.

second, there are problems with the quantization of supermembranes, i.e.
they are quantum mechanically unstable [6]. (this instability was the original
reason why many abandoned supermembrane theory soon after it was formu-
lated. however, it may be possible to re-interpret this instability in terms of
0-branes in matrix models [7].)

third, the precise relationship between membranes and m-theory is also
in particular, m-theory also contains ve-branes, and perhaps

not known.
higher order corrections to membranes as well.

our philosophy, however, will be to investigate the rst problem. although
the model is supercially non-renormalizable by power counting methods, it
may possess enough symmetry to eliminate large classes of diverges. for exam-
ple, there is no counterpart to the  = 0 equation for membranes, because there
is no conformal symmetry on the world volume. however, in a later paper we
will show that supersymmetry will in fact set the analogous supermembrane
term to zero because of the super bianchi identities. thus, supersymmetry
(which demands compatibility with the 11d supergravity background equa-
tions) is sucient to render the theory one-loop renormalizable.

our ultimate goal is to show whether or not supersymmetry is sucient to
kill the divergences of the supermembrane theory to all orders. this, in turn,
would allow us to compute the higher order corrections to 11d supergravity
in the m-theory action. if a recursion relation can be written for the higher
order corrections, then we may be able to make statements concerning the
entire theory, to all orders.

however, even if this ultimate goal is not realized, we expect to nd in-

2

teresting surprises. for example, we will show that, unlike the string case,
one needs both one-loop and two-loop graphs in order to derive the standard
equations of motion for the graviton and anti-symmetric tensor eld. in the
same way that the non-renormalizable four-fermion theory or the massive vec-
tor meson theory proved to be interesting laboratories for particle physics, it
may turn out that supermembrane actions, even if they are inherently non-
renormalizable, may be an interesting laboratory for m-theory.

2 riemann normal co-ordinates

our starting point is the bosonic membrane action:

l1 =

1
2

ijgij

(1)

where g is the space-time metric, where greek letters , ,  = 0, 1, 2...10,
where ij is the metric on the three-dimensional world volume, where roman
letters i, j, k = 1, 2, 3, and where  is the membrane co-ordinate.

to this action, we add a contribution from the anti-symmetric eld:

l2 = ijkaijk

(2)

which is found in the bosonic part of the supermembrane action. the total
action is then lt = l1 + l2, with  and  being two coupling constants.

notice that the action of this theory is gauge invariant under the transfor-

mation:

a =  + ...

(3)

notice that the action also contains a world volume metric ij.

in the
usual string action, this metric can be eliminated entirely via a gauge choice
and a conformal transformation. however, in the covariant membrane case,
we cannot eliminate all the degrees of freedom of the non-propagating world
instead, we will simply treat the metric ij as a classical
volume metric.
background eld. this means that we will have to keep ij arbitrary and
quantize the theory on a classical curved world volume.

3

next, we wish to power expand this action using the background eld
method applied to sigma models, using riemann normal co-ordinates [6]. let
the space-time variable ( ) obey a standard geodesic equation:

d2
d 2 + 



d
d

d
d

= 0

(4)

now expand the membrane co-ordinate  around a classical conguration


cl:

 = 

cl + 

(5)

where  is the quantum correction to the classical conguration. now power
expand  in terms of :

 =  

1
2


 

1
3!


...

(6)

the various co-ecients in this power expansion can be laboriously computed
by inserting the expression back into the geodesic equation. for example, we
nd that 

 is the usual christoel symbol, and:


 = 

  



  




in general, the higher coecients are equal to:

12...n = dn    d1




(7)

(8)

where we take the covariant derivatives only with respect to the lower indices.
our goal is now to power expand the lagrangian l1 +l2 in terms of , and
then integrate out  from the action. this will give us a series of potentially
divergent graphs, whose structure we wish to examine.

in general, this power expansion becomes prohibitively dicult as we progress

to higher and higher orders, so we will instead use the formalism introduced
by mukhi [9].

one reason why this expansion is unwieldy is because the standard taylor
expansion is non-covariant. if we have a function i and power expand it, we
nd:

4

i =

i (n)



xn=0

(9)

(10)

where:

i (n) =

1

n! z dx11x1

1 z dx22x2

2   z dxnnxn

n i

where the co-ordinates on the three dimensional world volume are given by xi,
and where x
i

is a functional derivative:

x
 =



(x)

clearly, iterating the operator:

z dx (x)x



yields non-covariant results.

let us dene instead the operator :

where d is a functional covariant derivative. for example:

 = z dx (x)d

da[(y)] = ha((x)) + 

((x))a((x))i 3(x  y)

then we can power expand the lagrangian as follows:

where:

l =

l(n)



xn=0

l(n) =

1
n!

nl

to perform the power expansion, we derive the following identities:

is given by:

since the original action was gauge invariant in the anti-symmetric eld,

because of gauge invariant, all subsequent terms will involve this covariant

before we can begin to set up the perturbation series, we must rst diago-
t . the space-time matrix g can be eliminated
, where the roman index a represents tangent

nalize the quadratic term l(2)
in favor of the usual vierbein ea
space indices.

9

now let us replace g with ea

ea

. with a little bit of algebra, we can move

the vierbein past the derivative and prove the identity:

di = ea
ea

(cid:16)i + i

(cid:17)
 a = dia

= ia + iab

where a = ea

 and where:

)eb + ea
which is self-consistent with the equation dea

ab
 = (ea

eb


 = 0, as desired.

(34)

(35)

in this fashion, we can now write everything with tangent space indices.
we nd that the only change is that we must replace green letters , , , 
with roman letters a, b, c, d.

for the general case, we nd:

l(n)

t =

n1

xk=0

di1a1di2a2    dikak    anli1i2 ik(n)

a1 an

(36)

where ai are dened in the tangent space.

3 regularization

now that we have power expanded the original action in terms of a, where a
is the tangent space index on curved space-time, we must now integrate over
the quantum eld a dened on the tangent space, which will leave us with
divergent terms whose structure we wish to analyze.

we will power expand around the term:

l(2)

1 =

1
2

ijdiadja

(37)

where the space-time metric g has been absorbed into the vierbeins.

if we perform the integration over a, then (subject to a regularization

scheme):

10

ht a(x)b(x)i  ab + ...

(38)

where the right hand side is linearly divergent via some large momentum scale
, and there are important corrections to this equation crucially dependent
on the regularization scheme.
then the rst term in l(2)

t contributes the following term:

which in turn yields the two equations:

l(2)
ab ht abi

and:

ht abi

1


ijrabij

ht abiijkijkdafb

(39)

(40)

(41)

unlike the superstring, there is no conformal symmetry by which we can
set this divergent term to zero. in this paper, we will simply set the lowest
order divergent term to zero by at. this is a weakness in this approach. this,
in some sense, denes the model, i.e. the theory can only propagate on certain
background elds which set the lowest order divergent term to zero.

however, for the supermembrane, we will show in a later paper that there
is enough supersymmetry to allow us to set this divergent term to zero, so we
have:

r = 0; dafabcd = 0

(42)

the second equation is just the equation of motion for the anti-symmetric
eld, as expected. however, the rst equation is rather troubling, since there
should be a term proportional to f 2. the fact that this term is missing means
that the equations of motion are actually inconsistent. there exists no action
involving g and f which yields these equations of motion. thus, we must
carefully analyze our regularization scheme and go to higher interactions. this
is dierent from the superstring case, where the one-loop results are sucient
to yield self-consistent equations of motion. for the membrane, we nd that
we must go to two loops in order to obtain self-consistent results.

11

now let us generalize this result to higher orders by carefully introducing
a regularization scheme. there is a problem with dimensional regularization,
however. if we analytically continue the integral:

ddp

(p2 + m2)  (1 

d
2

)

z

(43)

we nd that it is nite for d = 3. it diverges with a pole at d = 4, but is
formally nite for odd dimensions. this strange result does not change for
higher loops, since multiple integrals over the momenta yield factors of (k),
where k is half-integral, which is again nite for d = 3. furthermore, when
we introduce supersymmetry, we nd that dimensional regularization does not
respect this symmetry, which only holds at d = 3 for supermembranes. hence,
dimensional regularization poses some problems. in fact, supersymmetry is so
stringent, it appears that nding a suitable regularization method is problem-
atic for any method.

we will, instead, use standard point-splitting and proper time methods,
separating the points on the world volume at which the various (x) meet at
a vertex. this, of course, will violate general covariance and supersymmetry
by point-splitting. however, point-splitting methods are convenient since the
divergence within a feynman integral occur when elds are dened at the
same world volume point, i.e. x  y on the world volume.
then the two-point greens function can be written as:

ht a(x)b(x)i = igab(x  x)

(44)

where x and x represents points on the three dimensional world volume, and:

1

 hdab

i ijdbc

j + (cid:16)r + m2(cid:17)i gac(x, x) = 3(x  x)ab

(45)

(although the theory is massless, notice that we added in a small mass m2 in
order to handle infrared divergences. in non-linear sigma models of this type,
it can be shown that this mass regulartor cancels against other terms in the
perturbation theory. notice that we introduce a parameter  which takes into
account the curvature on the world volume. this term will be of interest when

12

we introduce fermions into our formalism. however, here we can set this term
 to zero for our case.)

the solution of this greens function is complicated by two facts. first,
the greens function is dened over both a curved three dimensional world
volume manifold and 11 dimensional space-time manifold, and hence we have
to use the formalism developed for general relativity.

second, the greens function will in general introduce unwanted curvatures
on the world volume. this is because the covariant derivative di contains the
connection eld iab
i = iab + aab
i ,
which is the familiar covariant derivative in o(d) gauge theory. thus, when
we invert the opertor diijdj, we encounter gauge invariant terms like the
square of rab

 . if we set this equal to aab

i , then dab

ij , where

[di, dj]ab = rab
ij

(46)

in two dimensions, curvature terms of this sort do not contribute to the
perturbation expansion to lowest order when d = 2 [8]. however, these terms
do in fact contribute to the perturbation expansion when d = 4 [10]. in fact,
the presence of these terms renders the quantum theory of the d = 4 non-linear
sigma model non-renormalizable, since they introduce new counter-terms not
present in the original action.

given the potential problems with this term, let us introduce the proper

time formalism [11]. let s be the schwinger proper time variable:

gab(x, x) = ((x))1/4gab(x, x)((x))1/4 = iz 

0

dshx, s|x, 0iab

where  = detij and we choose a positive metric on the world volume.

we impose the boundary condition:

hx, 0|x, 0iab = ab3(x  x)

now let us assume the ansatz for the greens function:

hx, s|x, 0i =

i

(4is)d/2 (x)1/41/2(x, x)(x)1/4f ab(x, x; is)

 exp 

(x, x)

2is  ism2!

13

(47)

(48)

(49)

where (x, x) is one-half the square of the distance along the geodesic between
x and x, where  is given by:

(x)1/4(x, x)(x)1/4 = det (,i,j(x, x))

and:



f (x, x)ab =

(is)naab

n (x, x)

xn=0

(50)

(51)

the object of this section is to power expand the greens function in terms
of (x, x). in particular,  obeys a number of useful identities, among them:

ii = 2

(52)

where i = i, and we raise and lower indices via ij. from this identity, we
can establish a large number of identities for various derivatives of .

when calculating feynman diagrams, we will nd that they diverge ac-
cording to inverse powers of . hence, we can compare the large momentum
cut-o  to , i.e.

this new greens function satises the schrodinger equation:

  1/2


ishx, s|x, 0i = hhx, s|x, 0i



where the hamiltonian is given by:

h = 1/4di1/2ijdj1/4 + r + m2

(53)

(54)

(55)

if we insert the expansion of the greens function into the dening equation
for the greens function, we are left with a constraint on the undetermined
function f :

now let us solve the an iteratively. the equation for aab

0 give us:

idia0 = 0

(57)

(58)

the goal of this exercise is to extract out the divergent terms within the
greens function. let us, therefore, slowly let x approach x. repeated dier-
entiation of the previous formula yields:

we now make the denitions  = 2m2,  = (/2m2)1/2,  = n+1(d/2).

to nd the power expansion in , we use the fact that:

h (2)

(66)

in particular, we nd that the propagator in curved space is linearly di-
vergent in momentum, as expected. the troublesome terms, a1 and a2, we

16

see, are nite in three dimensions, and so can be dropped from our discussion
(which is not the case for d = 4). although they ruin the renormalization
program for four dimensions, we nd that they drop out in three dimensions.

for completeness, we present the entire series:

(67)

notice that, as x  x, we nd that the integral diverges linearly with
the momentum, but the troublesome curvature term involving rab
ij do not
contribute (as they do in four dimensions). hence, from now on, we can
simply use the fact that the propagator diverges linearly with momentum.

lastly, we can also use this formalism to compute two point functions

involving derivatives. if we have two point functions like:

ht ia(x)jb(y)i = x

i y

j ht a(x)b(y)i = x

i y

j

gab()

(68)

where gab() is the propagator, then we can, for small distance separations,
use the fact that (x, y)  (1/2)(x  y)iij(x  y)j, so that:

i y
x

j (x, y)  ij

(69)

by taking repeated derivatives of the propagator as a function of the separation
, one can therefore contruct the contraction of an arbitrary number of  elds.

4 two loop order

we saw earlier that the one loop result was inconsistent. an action of the form
r+f 2
 cannot have equations of motion given by r = 0 and df = 0
we must therefore probe the two loop result to see if we can re-establish the
consistency of the model.

consider rst the case of two external lines n = 2.

17

the most interesting two loop graph is given by the contraction of lij(3)

with itself. this gives us the contraction:

ijkfkht di(x)dj(x)(x)di (y)dj

if we perform the contractions over , we nd, with a little bit of work, the

which vanishes by the anti-symmetry of the f tensor.

notice that the divergence can be absorbed into a rescaling:  = r/. (in the
next section, we will see that the leading divergences can in fact be absorbed
by this rescaling to all orders.)

after rescaling, we nd that the equation of motion of the graviton is given

by:

r +

1

ff 

 = 0

(73)

(unfortunately, the term proportional to g does not appear in the equations
of motions, signalling a possible inconsistency. this is normally solved for the
superstring case by adding an another eld, the dilaton. we will see that this
possible inconsistency vanishes for the supermembrane case.)

there is also a self-consistency between the equations of motion for the
metric and the anti-symmetric eld which must be re-established at every
loop order, and hence this provides a powerful check on the correctness of any
model of membranes.

higher order graphs are easy to construct but more tedious to evaluate.
we will present the contractions necessary to perform two and three loop
calculations, but will not explicitly compute the graphs.

for example, the r2 and dr two loop terms are contained in the contrac-

tion of l(4)

1,, so we have the two loop contribution:

18

1

24

ijijhr; + r

riht i

(74)

two loop curvature terms are also contained in the contraction of the

square of l(3)

1. this contraction yields:

1 l(3)

hl(3)

1 i = (cid:18) 2

3(cid:19)2 ijrjht di(x)(x)(x)

(y) (y)iijr  jdi 

 di (y)

  + ...

(75)

these two terms give us two loop correction terms to the curvature tensor,

yielding complicated combinations of r2 and dr terms.

lastly, we can also calculate the two and three loop contribution for the
anti-symmetric eld. for example, two loop corrections to the equations of
motion are given by contracting l(4)
2 with two propagators. this term is
contained within:

2 i = ijk(cid:26) 1
hl(4)

4!

dddfijk

4!

r

dfijk(cid:27)ht i + ...

(76)

this gives us terms like rf and dddf .

similarly, we can also contract over the square of lij(4)

2, which will give

us a f ddf term. it is contained within:

4! !2
2)2i =  18

5 power counting

now let us analyze the divergence of graphs to all orders in perturbation theory.
because the coupling constant has negative dimension, we can always increase

19

the degree of divergence of any multi-loop graph by adding more insertions.
in this sense, the theory is not renormalizable. but we will see in this section
how many divergences we can absorb via the coupling constant  and .

consider rst the lagrangian l1 with only the metric tensor, without the
anti-symmetric eld. let l be the number of loops in an arbitrarily compli-
cated feynman graph. then its contribution to the over-all divergence is 3l,
due to d3p. let i be the number of internal lines in the graph. so its contribu-
tion is 2l due to 1/p2. let vn be the number of n-point vertices in the graph.
since each n-point graph in the action has two momenta associated with it, it
can contribute at most 2vn. let e equal the number of external lines in the
graph. since each external line subtracts o a line which could have become
an internal line, it contributes n. then the supercial divergence of any
graph d is given by:

d = 3l  2i + 2



xn=3

vn  n

(78)

now calculate the number of momentum integrations. each internal line
contributed d3p. each n-point vertex contributes a momentum-conserving

delta function 3(p pi), which deletes three momentum integrations per ver-

tex. and then there is one over-all conservation of momentum factor. the
sum of these integrations, in turn, contributes an over-all (d3pi)l momentum
integration for the loops. thus, we have:

l = i 



xn=3

vn + 1

now insert the second equation into the rst, and we obtain:

d = l  n + 2

(79)

(80)

notice that the degree of divergence d is just a function of the number of
loops l and the number of external lines e.

now let us see if we can re-absorb this divergence into the coupling constant
. let  be the momentum cut-o for the graph. recall that the perturba-
tion expansion parameter is . then the leading divergences of the n-point
amplitude an , symbolically speaking, diverge as:

20

an =



xl=1

l1an,l

where we only compute the loop corrections.

we have just shown that an,l diverges as:

an,l  ln +2 an,l
now let us re-dene the coupling constant as:

r


 

which we performed in the last section for the single loop.

rescaling the graph, we now have:

an = 3n  xl=1

l1 an,l!

(81)

(82)

(83)

(84)

thus, the leading supercial divergence can be absorbed into  by a rescal-
ing. the larger n, the faster the graph converges. in particular, we see that
the amplitude is formally nite for n = 3 and beyond, but diverges still for
n = 2. we can eliminate the n = 2 divergence by simply declaring that the
background elds obey the standard equations of motion, thereby dening the
model.

now let us generalize the simple power counting to the general case, in-
cluding the anti-symmetric eld. the power counting is much worse, since we
now have 3 momenta attached to each vertex function, rather than 2. the
leading divergences all come from this sector.

so the degree of divergence is now given by:

d = 3l  2i + 3

vn + xn



xn=3

(85)

(if some of the lines on the vertex are external lines, this reduces the degree
of divergence of the graph, so we have to compensate this by adding in xn .
for example, x2 = 2, x3 = 3.)

21

the number of momentum integrations is given by:

l = i 



xn=3

vn + 1

(86)

notice that we can no longer cancel both i and p vn to arrive at a simple

relationship involving just l and n. thus, we need one more constraint to
eliminate the vertex factors.

let us count the number of lines in a graph. each of the vn vertices

lines to the graph. when two of these vertices vn are joined, they form an

contributes n lines to the graph. thus, they collectively contribute p nvn
internal line, which is therefore counted twice. this means that the sum p nvn

counts each internal line twice, and each external line once (since external lines
are not paired o). thus, we have:



nvn = 2i + n

(87)

xn=3

by examining these three sets of equations, we see that, in general, it is not
possible to eliminate all the vn in a graph. therefore, we will only concentrate
on the leading divergence within a graph and ignore lower order divergences.
let us see which vertices contribute the most to the over-all divergence.
a vertex vn contains 3 momenta. let us say that we replace it with two
small vertices vn1 and vn+2 which are joined by an internal line. the over-all
contribution from these two attached vertices is given by 3 + 3  2 = 4, where
the 2 comes from 1/p2. thus, we can always increase the over-all divergence
of a graph by replacing vn with pairs of smaller n-point vertices. this process
can be continued, until we are left with a graph with only v4 and v5 vertices
left. thus, the leading divergence is now given with only v4 and v5. if we
eliminate v4, we are left with:

d = 2l 

1
2

v5 +

n
2

+ xn + 1

(88)

(notice that this equation depends on whether the overall number of vertex
lines is even or odd. if it is even, then v5 = 0.)

in this way, we can compute the over-all divergence of a graph. however,
there is simple short-cut we can use. if we examine the perturbation expansion

22

of l1 and l2, we see that the primary dierence is that the internal vertices
of l1 contain two derivatives, while the internal vertices of l2 contain three
derivatives. because the coupling constant 1/ appears in front of each term
in l1, we see that each internal vertex function diverges, at most, like 3.
but if we let  remain a nite constant, we see that each internal vertex in
l2 diverges as 3 as well. thus, by only rescaling  but keeping  nite, we
see that the divergence of the purely metric theory is identical to the theory
coupled to anti-symmetric tensor elds. (, although it is nite, will ultimately
be xed by requiring consistency in the equations of motion of the background
elds).

6 conclusion

in eld theory, the study of non-renormalizable lagrangians, such as the four-
fermion model, or massive vector theories, has given us insight in deep physical
processes. likewise, the bosonic membrane action, by naive power counting,
is non-renormalizable on the world volume, but may give us insight into m-
theory. although the bosonic membrane theory is ultimately probably not a
consistent quantum theory, the techniques we have used here will generalize
to the supermembrane case.

in this paper, we have expanded the bosonic membrane action around
riemann normal co-ordinates, treating the theory as a non-linear sigma model,
and calculated the regularized propagator and higher loop graphs.

in particular, we found:
a) the standard dimensional regularization method apparently breaks down
at d = 3, where the gamma function no longer has a pole. instead, we de-
veloped the proper time and point-splitting formalism in curved space for the
d = 3 membrane action. although we lost general covariance, this gave us
an intuitive way in which to isolate all the divergences of higher graphs, since
the singularities emerge when two elds touch on the world volume.
it is
then a simple matter to analyze complicated graphs visually and isolate their
divergences.

b) the renormalization program in four dimensions for the non-linear sigma
model is ruined by the presence of terms like tr [rijrij]. however, we have

23

shown that these terms are not a problem in three dimensions.

c) we found that the single loop graph was insucient to generate self-
consistent equations of motion for the background elds. this was surprising,
since setting  = 0 in the usual string formalism yields self-consistent equations
of motions at the rst loop level.

d) since the formalism we have developed works for arbitrary loop level,
we can calculate higher order corrections to the equations of motion. we nd,
at two loop level, new terms which have the form: r2, dr, f ddf , f rf ,
etc.

e) we found that, by naive counting arguments on arbitrary loop graphs, we
could absorb the leading divergences into a rescaling of the coupling constant
. by setting   r/, where  is a large momentum cut-o parameter, we
could absorb the leading divergences. the amplitudes then diverge as 3n , so
the leading divergences actually vanish if n = 3, 4, .... for the case n = 2, we
set the divergence to zero, thereby yielding the equations of motions. we found
that the counting of divergences remains the same if the coupling constant 
for the anti-symmetric elds is nite. this doesnt mean that the action is
renormalizable, of course, since we still have to analyze non-leading graphs
and many other subtle problems.

one weakness of this formalism is that the equations of motion emerge
only after setting one divergences to zero by hand. hence, we have to dene
the theory by placing in the background elds on-shell.

in the superstring case, conformal symmetry allows us to set  = 0. how-
ever, the entire motivation of our approach is to analyze the d = 11 supermem-
brane, where supersymmetry is sucient to set these lower order divergences
to zero. our ultimate goal, therefore, is to see whether supersymmetry is
strong enough to control the divergences found in the supermembrane the-
ory, and whether we can obtain the the m-theory action by expanding around
higher order corrections to the standard d=11 supergravity action, and then
use recursion relations to probe the entire action. the supersymmetric case
will be discussed in a forthcoming paper.
