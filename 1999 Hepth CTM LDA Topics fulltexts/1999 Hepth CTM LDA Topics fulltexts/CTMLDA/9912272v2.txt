abstract

we construct twisted quantum bundles and adjoint sections on noncommutative t4, and in-
vestigate relevant d-brane bound states with non-abelian backgrounds. we also show that the
noncommutative t4 with non-abelian backgrounds exhibits so(4, 4|z) duality and via this du-
ality we get a morita equivalent t4 on which only d0-branes exist. for a reducible non-abelian
background, the moduli space of d-brane bound states in type ii string theory takes the form

1 introduction

recent developments in nonperturbative string theories have provided new powerful tools to
understand supersymmetric gauge theories [1]. the bogomolnyi-prasad-sommerfeld (bps)
brane congurations led to many exact results on the vacuum structure of supersymmetric
gauge theories. one may be interested in counting degeneracy of d-brane bound states of
type ii string theory compactied on r1,9d  x in which a gauge eld strength f and a
neveu-schwarz b eld on the brane are nonzero. then p-branes wrapped on a compact p-
cycle wp  x and their bound states look like particles in the eective r1,9d spacetime.
moreover, the degeneracy of the bound states is the same as the number of ground states in
the corresponding quantum eld theory on the d-brane worldvolume [2].

the d-brane moduli space [3, 4] can be dened as a space of chan-paton vector bundle e

over x or a space of solutions to the equation given by

 = fm n m n  +  = 0

for some pair of covariantly constant spinors  and  on r1,9d  x. the various rr charges
are given by the mukai vector q = v(e) = ch(e)q a(x)  h 2(x, z) where ch(e) =
tr exph 1
2 (f  b)i is the chern character and a(x) = 1  p1(x)/24 is the a-roof genus for

four dimensional manifold x. then the supersymmetric, bps bound states, for example (d0,
d2, d4) bound states on t4 or k3, are allowed by the chern-simons couplings [5]

it was shown in [6, 7] that noncommutative geometry can be successfully applied to the com-
pactication of m(atrix) theory [8] in a certain background. in those papers, it was argued that
m(atrix) theory in a 3-form potential background with one index along the lightlike circle and
2 indices along td is a gauge theory on noncommutative torus, specically (d+1)-dimensional
noncommutative super yang-mills (ncsym) theory. many more discussions of m- and string
theory compactications on these geometries followed, for example [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].
one obvious advantage of ncsym theory dened on td is that the t-duality, so(d, d|z),
of type ii string theory compactied on torus becomes manifest [6, 7, 13, 14, 15]. morita
equivalence between two noncommutative torus [10, 11] encompasses the nahm transformation
part of t-duality, not clearly observed in conventional yang-mills theory. using this symmetry,
it may be possible to systematically count d-brane bound states on t4 or k3 as ground state
congurations for the supersymmetric gauge theory.

for compactications on t2 and t3, generic u(n) bundles on it admit vanishing su(n)
curvature [6, 12, 13]. however, for compactications on tori of dimension 4 or larger, not

2

all bundles allow vanishing su(n) curvature so we have to consider more generic bundles
with nonvanishing su(n) curvature.
it turns out [16, 17] that one can construct twisted
su(n) gauge bundle on t4 with fractional instanton number. however, in discussing the
u(n) gauge theory as d-brane dynamics, it is understood that the total instanton number
is integral since the instanton number is related to d0-brane charges inside d4-branes, which
should satisfy dirac quantization due to the existence of d6-brane in type iia string theory
[18]. in [19, 20], t hooft solutions on twisted bundles on commutative tori were realized by
d-brane congurations (d-brane bound states) wrapped on tori in type ii string theory, and it
was shown that u-duality relates their bound states.

in general one can consider gauge bundle on t4 with non-abelian constant curvature [17].
in that case, non-abelian backgrounds can be obviously supersymmetric for self-dual or anti-
self-dual elds since the supersymmetry of d-brane world volume theory may be given by

 = fm n m n .

thus, in order to study the bps spectrums of the ncsym theory on the non-abelian back-
grounds, it will be useful to construct the corresponding gauge bundles.
in the presence of
non-abelian backgrounds as well as abelian backgrounds, the gauge bundle may be twisted
by the background magnetic uxes. while abelian backgrounds universally twist u(n) gauge
bundle, in the case of non-abelian backgrounds where the magnetic uxes in u(n) are decom-
posed into u(k) part and u(l) part [17], the magnetic ux in u(k) part twists u(k)  u(n)
gauge bundle and that in u(l) part does u(l)  u(n) gauge bundle. this causes two dierent
deformation parameters to appear.

the chern character maps k-theory to cohomology i.e. ch : k0(x)  heven(x, z) and
k 1 to odd cohomology and ch(e) = ch0(e) + ch1(e) + ch2(e) when x is 4-dimensional and
e is a vector bundle over x. here ch0(e) is the rank of e, ch1(e) is the rst chern class
and ch2(e) corresponds to the instanton number. ch1(e) is integral winding number when
the torus is commutative and it is not integer anymore when the torus is noncommutative but
ch2(e) still remains integral even if the torus becomes noncommutative [10, 11, 14]. however
d-brane charges take values in k(x), the k-theory of x [21], which constitutes a group of
integer z. the (4+1)-dimensional u(n) sym theory can be interpreted as dynamics of n
d4-branes. six magnetic uxes are d2-branes wound around 6 two-cycles of t4. instantons
are d0-branes bound to d4-branes. thus, even when ns-ns two-form potential background is
turned on, the physical d-brane numbers should be integers. in addition, the rank, 6 uxes,
and instanton (altogether, eight components) make a fundamental multiplet of the weyl spinor
representation of so(4, 4|z) [14].

since the explicit constructions of twisted bundles and adjoint sections in the literatures have

3

been performed only for abelian backgrounds, we will construct them for constant non-abelian
backgrounds in this paper. in section 2, we construct twisted bundles on noncommutative t4.
in section 3, adjoint sections on the twisted bundle will be constructed. in section 4, we show
that the modules of d-brane bound states exhibit an so(4, 4|z) duality and the action of this
group gives morita equivalent t4 on which only d0-branes exist. section 5 devotes conclusion
and comments on our results. in appendix, we present some details of the representation of
so(4, 4|z) cliord algebra.

2 twisted quantum bundles on t4

to dene the noncommutative geometry, we understand the space is noncommutative, viz.

[x, x] = 2i.

(1)

then the noncommutative t4, which will be denoted by t4
ators u dened by u = eix and satises the commutation relation

, is generated by translation oper-

uu = e2i uu.

(2)

also, we introduce partial derivatives satisfying

[, x] = 
,

[, ] = 0.

we construct quantum u(n) bundles on t4

 following the construction of [12, 13] and [17].

start with a constant curvature connection

 =  + ifx,
where greek indices run over spatial components only.
in this paper we allow the u(n)
gauge elds with nonvanishing su(n) curvature in order to consider non-abelian backgrounds.
following the ansatz taken by t hooft [17], we take the curvature f as the cartan subalgebra
element:

(3)

where f (1)

 = trf and f (2)

  u(1)  su(n). the constant curvature is given by

f = f (1)

 + f (2)
 ,

and one can calculate to get

f = i[,].

f = (2f + 2f f ).

4

(4)

(5)

(6)

note that both f and  are antisymmetric 4  4 matrices.

the gauge transformations of elds in the adjoint representation of gauge group are insen-
sitive to the center of the group, e.g. zn for su(n). thus, for the adjoint elds in su(n)
gauge theory, it is sucient to consider the gauge group as being su(n)/zn . however, there
can be an obstruction to go from an su(n)/zn principal ber bundle to an su(n) bundle
if the second homology group of base manifold x, h2(x, zn ), does not vanish [22]. in order
to describe such a nontrivial u(n) bundle, it is helpful to decompose the gauge group into its
abelian and non-abelian components

u(n) =(cid:16)u(1)  su(n)(cid:17)/zn .

(7)

it means that we identify an element (g1, gn )  u(1)su(n) with (g1c1, cgn ), where c  zn .
therefore one can arrange the twists in u(n) to be trivial by cancelling them between su(n)
and u(1) [19]. this requires consistently combining solutions of su(n)/zn with u(1) solutions
as to cancel the total twist.

to characterize the generic u(n) gauge bundle on t4

, we allow the gauge bundle be periodic

up to gauge transformation , i.e.

(x + 2

 ) = (x)(x)1

 (x).

(8)

consistency of the transition functions of the u(n) bundle requires the so-called cocycle con-
dition

(x + 2

 )(x) = (x + 2

 )(x).

however the su(n) transition function e(x) may be twisted as [16]
 )e(x),

 )e(x) = z e(x + 2

e(x + 2

where z = e2in /n is the center of su(n).

write (x) as a product of an x-dependent part and a constant part

(x) = ei(p (1)

 +p (2)

 )x

w,

(9)

(10)

(11)

where p (1)
 is antisymmetric and proportional to the identity in the lie algebra of u(n) while
p (2)
 is an element of u(1)  su(n). and constant n  n unitary matrices w are taken as
su(n) solutions generated by t hooft clock and shift matrices. for comparision, our p (2)

in (11) corresponds to the constant su(n) eld strength  in t hooft ansatz in [17] if we
consider commutative t4.

in the case of vanishing su(n) cuvature, f (2)

 = 0, an explicit construction of
gauge bundles with magnetic and electric uxes was given in [14]. for the nonvanishing su(n)

 = p (2)

5

curvature case, following t hooft solution [17] we consider diagonal connections which break
u(n) to u(k)  u(l) where each block has vanishing su(k) and su(l) curvature. we also
consider the groups u(k) and u(l) as u(k) = (u(1)su(k))/zk and u(l) = (u(1)su(l))/zl,
respectively. thus the twists of su(k) or su(l) part can be trivialized by each u(1) part. since
the u(1) in u(n) is the direct sum of u(1) in u(k) and u(1) in u(l), the su(n) twist tensor
should be a sum of su(k) and su(l) twist tensors.
here we take the generator  in u(1)  su(n) as
0

(12)

 =(cid:18) l 1k

0 k 1l(cid:19) ,

where k  k matrix 1k is the identity in u(k) and l  l matrix 1l is that in u(l). then we take
the su(n) connection to be proportional to . since the u(n) gauge eld in (3) contain only
the matrix  and the identity matrix 1n in u(n) and so commutes with w, in checking (8),
w are irrelevant in our situation and we have

p = 2f (1n + 2f )1 = 2(1n + 2f )1f,

(13)

where p = p (1)
the following commutation relation for w

 + p (2)

 . from the ansatz of  (11) and the cocycle condition (9), we obtain

where m is given by

ww = e2im /n ww,

here, an integral matrix m (1)
integral is proportional to .

m = m (1) + m (2) = n(2p  p p ).
 is coming from the trace part of u(n), and m (2)

 which is also

we now construct the solutions a la t hooft for bundles with a constant curvature back-
ground (4) on t4
. the greatest common divisor of (m, n) is invariant under sl(4, z) and
we take it as q. also, we assume the twist matrix m and the ux p have the form of q copies

(14)

(15)

(16)

(17)

of u(n) matrices m and ep dened by

where 1q is a q-dimensional identity matrix. in other words,

m = n(2ep  ep ep ),

p = 1q  ep ,

n = q n, m = q 1q  m,

where n is the reduced rank. in this case, it is convenient to consider transition functions 
and w as the following block diagonal form [13]

 = 1q  ,

w = 1q  fw,

6

(18)

where  and fw belong to u(n) and su(n), respectively. thus we will consider only one copy

described by u(n) transition functions .

let us dene su(n) matrices u and v as follows

ukl = e2i(k1)/n k,l,

vkl = k+1,l,

k, l = 1,   , n,

(19)

so that they satisfy uv = e2i/nv u. for t4
put f (2)

 = 0, there are solutions of the form

 = p (2)

 with vanishing su(n) curvature where we can

fw = u av b,

where a and b are integers. in order for the u(n) twists to be trivial as in (9), the su(n)
twists n should be balanced with the u(1) uxes m = m 1n. thus, the equation (14)
gives

n = m = ab  ab mod n.

(21)

in the case of commutative t4, t hooft solutions with nonvanishing su(n) curvature are
described by breaking u(n) to u(k)  u(l) so that background gauge elds live along the
diagonals of the u(k) and u(l) [17]. here we have taken n as n = k + l. for t4
, we now adopt
a t hooft type solution given by

(20)

(22)

1 v b

1 u c

2 v d
2 ,

fw = u a

where a, b, c and d are integers to be determined. the matrices u1,2 and v1,2 acting in the
two subgroup su(k) and su(l) satisfy the following commutation rules

u1v1 = e2i/kikv1u1,
u2v2 = e2i/lilv2u2,

[u1, u2] = [u1, v2] = [v1, u2] = [v1, v2] = 0,

where n  n matrices ik and il have the forms respectively
il =(cid:18) 0

ik =(cid:18) 1k

0(cid:19) ,

0

0

0

0 1l(cid:19) .

(23)

(24)

as discussed above, the triviality of the u(n) twists requires a balance between the su(n)
twists n and the u(1) uxes m(1)
 . similarly,
since each block has vanishing su(k) or su(l) curvature, the uxes m(k)
 in
u(l) have to cancel the twists n(k)
 in su(l) respectively, which leads us the
identication as in (21)

 , which leads to the identication n 1n = m(1)

 in su(k) and n(l)

 in u(k) and m(l)

n(k)
 = m(k)

 , n(l)

 = m(l)
.

(25)

7

following the identication (25), one can solve the total su(n) twists n in terms of two sets
of twists n(k)
 as in [17]. using (23) the equation (14) gives

, and the su(n) uxes m(2)

 and n(l)

1n =

taking the trace on the above equation, we get

where

n = n(k)

 + n(l)
,

n(k)
 = ab  ab mod k,
n(l)
 = cd  cd mod l.

recall that the pfaans given by twists n(k)

 and n(l)

 satisfy

n(l)

n(l)

 = 0 mod l

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

due to triviality of the su(k) and su(l) parts. however, the total su(n) twists may satisfy

1
8

nn 6= 0 mod n

since it is not trivial in this construction. and the 0-brane charge is given by

c = k  p f (n(k)/k) + l  p f (n(l)/l) = c (k) + c (l)

(30)

(31)

which is an integer, due to the triviality of each sector [19]. therefore, our construction corre-
sponds to d-brane bound states involved with (4, 2, 2) or (4, 2, 2, 0) system depending on the
value of c in the language of [19]. the (4, 2, 2) system is a bound state of 4-branes and 2-branes
with non-zero intersection number but no zero branes. the (4, 2, 2, 0) system is a bound state
of 4, 2, and 0-branes with non-zero 2-brane intersection number.
for an explicit construction of these systems, we may choose

n(k)
34 = n(l)

12 = 0, n(k)

12 6= 0, n(l)

34 6= 0

for (4, 2, 2), and

n(k)
12 = p(k), n(k)

34 = k, n(l)

12 = l, n(l)

34 = p(l)

for (4, 2, 2, 0). here, the 0-brane charge in the (4220) case is given by p(k) + p(l). notice that
in this construction, the (4, 2, 2) system can be contained in the (4, 2, 2, 0) system as a special
case.

8

since some work in this direction in the vanishing su(n) curvature case [14] was already
done via van baal construction [23], below we also show how we can construct a (4, 2, 2, 0)
system a la van baal in our case.

the equation (14) is covariant under sl(4, z). using this symmetry we can always make the
matrix m = m(k) + m(l) to a standard symplectic form by performing a sl(4, z) transformation
r,

where we choose m0 as

here we have taken a simple u(l) solution for convenience.

since we consider a special diagonal connection which breaks u(n) to u(k) u(l) and each
block has vanishing su(k) or su(l) curvature, the twisted bundle can be decomposed into
u(k) part and u(l) part and the construction in [23] can be applied to each part separately.
introduce qi = gcd(mi, k), l0 = gcd(m3, l) (i = 1, 2) and ki = k/qi, l1 = l/l0. in [23], it was
shown that twist-eating solutions of the type

il, can only exist if k1k2|k. we thus write k = k1k2k0. when this
where
restriction is satised, it is straightforward to check that the following solution satises (35),
fw1 = u m1/q1
 1k2  1k0  u m3/l0
fw2 = vk1  1k2  1k0  vl1  1l0
fw3 = 1k1  u m2/q2
 1k0  1l
fw4 = 1k1  vk2  1k0  1l,

where su(ki) matrices uki and vki are dened as

(uki)ab = e2i(a1)/ki a,b,

(vki)ab = a+1,b,

(vl1)cd = c+1,d,

a, b = 1,   , ki,
c, d = 1,   , l1,

(37)

so that they satisfy ukivki = e2i/kivkiuki and ul1vl1 = e2i/l1vl1ul1.

3 adjoint sections on twisted bundles

according to the correspondence between a compact space x and the c -algebra c(x) of
continuous functions on x, the entire topological structure of x is encoded in the algebraic
structure of c(x). continuous sections of a vector bundle over x can be identied with
projective modules over the algebra c(x). thus, in order to nd the topological structure of
the twisted bundle constructed in the previous section, it is necessary to construct the sections
of the bundle on t4
 are two connections then
the dierence d  d
-module. thus an
arbitrary connection d can be written as a sum of a constant curvature connection , and
an element of the endomorphism algebra:

 belongs to the algebra of endomorphisms of the t4

. furthermore as noted in [6], if d and d

d =  + a.

from the relation (8), we see that a is also an adjoint section. thus the algebra of adjoint
sections can be regarded as the moduli space of constant curvature connections.

in this section we will analyze the structure of the adjoint sections on the twisted bundles
on t4, closely following the method taken by brace et al. [13] and homan and verlinde [14].
according to the decomposition (17), we take the adjoint sections of u(n) as the form

(x) = 1q  e(x).

the sections e on the twisted bundle of the adjoint representation of u(n) are n-dimensional

 which is generated by (2), endomorphisms of the module, and

matrices of functions on t4
satisfy the twisted boundary conditions

suppose that the general solution for the n-dimensional matrices e(x) has the following

expansion

e(x + 2

 ) = e(x)1

 .

(38)

(39)

(40)

(41)

we also try to nd the solutions of the following form

z = eix x

where s
the basis taken in eq. (36), we dene the su(n) matrices  as follows

 ( = 1,   , 6) are integers and x is a matrix to be determined. here, according to

2 = vk1  1k2  1k0  1l,
3 = 1k1  uk2  1k0  1l,
4 = 1k1  vk2  1k0  1l,
5 = 1k  ul1  1l0,
6 = 1k  vl1  1l0.

(42)

one can directly check that the solution (40) is compatible with the boundary condition

(39) if the matrix x is taken as

x = qn

for (4, 2, 2) or (4, 2, 2, 0) backgrounds where the magnetic uxes take the form of diagonal
matrices breaking the gauge group to u(k)u(l), eq.(51) implies that the moduli space for the
d-brane bound states is described by two noncommutative parameters (k) and (l). thus
we expect that it takes the form (t4

where 12 and  are 2  2 identity and antisymmetric (12 = 21 = 1) matrices, respec-

transformation r, the corresponding so(4, 4|z) transformations  can be given by the set
(rm0rt , rn, l) [13]. with (53), the so(4, 4|z) transformation  can be found as

under the so(4, 4|z) transformation (59) or (60), the rank, 6 uxes, and instanton (eight
components altogether) make a fundamental multiplet of the weyl spinor representation of
so(4, 4|z) and this multiplet is mapped to morita equivalent tori by the action of so(4, 4|z)
[10, 11, 13, 14]. for convenience, the explicit construction will be performed only for the
so(4, 4|z) matrix (59) since, for the matrix (60), it is essentially similar, and so we will drop
the index () from here.

since the vector and spinor representations of so(4, 4|z) are related by

s1is = i

jj,

i, j = 1,   , 8,

where the gamma matrices satisfy

{i, j} = 2jij,

(62)

(63)

the spinor representation s() corresponding to the transformation  = 0(r) in (61) is a
product of s(0) corresponding to 0 and s(r) corresponding to (r)

s() = s(0)s(r).

(64)

on t4, the rank k, 6 uxes m, and u(k) instanton number, c = p f (m)/k, make a
fundamental multiplet of the weyl spinor representation of so(4, 4|z). we write such an
8-dimensional spinor  as

with the fermionic fock basis dened in the appendix. explicitly we take the spinor basis
 ( = 1,   , 8) as follows

 = (k, m34, m42, m23, m12, m13, m14, c).

using the result in the appendix, s(r) acts on this spinor as

(66)

(67)

0 = s(r) = (k, m2, 0, 0, m1, 0, 0, ec),

where ec = m1m2/k. note that the instanton number ec = m1 m2k/k1k2 is integral since k1k2|k

[23]. now one can check that, using the result in the appendix, s() acts on this spinor as

 = s(0)s(r) = s(0)0,

= (k0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).

(68)

since the transformation s() is an isomorphism between fock spaces described by quantum
number , (68) implies that the quantum tori with quantum number  is (morita) equivalent to

14

that of . similarly, the quantum tori described by the matrix (60) will be mapped to morita-
equivalent tori with quantum number (l0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0). thus it implies that the moduli
space of (4, 2, 2, 0) system as well as (4, 2, 2) system in u(n) super yang-mills theory can be
mapped to d0-brane moduli space and so it takes the form (t4
(l))ql0/sql0.
this prediction is also consistent with the fact that the moduli space for the reducible con-
nections takes the form of a product of smaller moduli spaces [4]. for a direct generalization,

(k))qk0/sqk0  (t4

expect that the moduli space of d-brane bound states in type ii string theory takes the form

one can consider a generic constant background which breaks u(n) to qa u(ka). then, we

5 conclusion and comments

we studied the modules of d-brane bound states on noncommutative t4 with non-abelian
constant backgrounds and examined the morita equivalence between them. we found that the
quantum tori with various d-brane charges is (morita) equivalent to that of d0-branes. for

a generic constant background which breaks u(n) to qa u(ka), it was shown that the moduli
space of d-brane bound states in type ii string theory takes the form qa(t4

the construction in this paper has only involved constant d-brane backgrounds. the non-
commutative instantons on t4 may share some properties with noncommutative instantons
on r4 [24] such as the resolution of small instanton singularity. unfortunately the explicit
construction of full instanton modules seems very hard, not due to the noncommutativeness
of the geometry, but rather due to the non-abelian properties of instanton connections.
it
would be very nice to give a construction also for these non-abelian instantons since it was
claimed in [25] that the moduli space of the twisted little string theories of k ns5-branes at
aq1 singularity [26], compactied on t3 is equal to the moduli space of k u(q) instantons on
a noncommuative t4.

(a))qa/sqa.

some interesting problems remain. the present construction may be generalized to the
noncommutative k3 and instanton solutions on it. the instanton congurations on noncom-
mutative t4 or k3 should be relevant to the microscopic structures of d1-d5 black holes with
bn sn s eld background, since the counting of microscopic bps bound states can be related to
the number of massless elds parameterizing the moduli space of the bound states [27]. it is
also interesting since the type iib string theory on ads3  s3  x with nonzero ns-ns b eld
along x, where x is k3 or t4, corresponds to the conformal sigma-model whose target space
is the moduli space of instantons on the noncommutative x [28].

another interesting problem is the deformation quantization of matrix theory on noncom-
mutative t4 [15]. although the algebra of functions on t4 is deformd by so-called  product,

15

the fuctions can be fourier expanded in the usual way. in that case,  product between fourier
expanded functions will be relatively simple. we hope to address these problems soon.

6 appendix

to construct the spinor representation s(), we introduce fermionic operators a
a = 4+/2 satisfying anti-commutation relations

 = /2 and

{a, a

} = ,

, a

{a

} = {a, a} = 0, ,  = 1,   , 4.

(69)

since the sl(4, z) transformation does not aect the rank and the instanton number and
the sl(4, z) is isomorphic to so(3, 3|z), we expect, in the spinor basis (65), that the spinor
representation s(r) corresponding to (r) in (61) has the following form

s(r) =

0

1
0
0 so(3, 3|z) 0
1
0

0

 .

indeed, according to [11], the operator (r) corresponding to (r) is given by

(r) = exp(aa
),

(r) = exp(),

and then the spinor representation s(r) is dened as

(r)| >=

8x=1 | > s(r).

(70)

(71)

(72)

obviously, acting on the rank ( = 1) and the instanton ( = 8) basis, s1(r) = s1(r) = 1
and s8(r) = s8(r) = 8. after a little algebra, we can nd the 6 6 matrix in (70) denoted
as h(r) = h3h2h1  so(3, 3|z)

where c is a 33 matrix formed by removing -th row and -th column from the 44 matrix
