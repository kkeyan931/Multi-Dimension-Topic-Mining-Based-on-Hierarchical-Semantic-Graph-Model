abstract

in this paper we discuss candidate superconformal n = 2 gauge theories that
realize the ads/cft correspondence with mtheory compactied on the homoge-
neous sasakian 7-manifolds m 7 that were classied long ago. in particular we focus
on the two cases m 7 = q1,1,1 and m 7 = m 1,1,1, for the latter the kaluza klein
spectrum being completely known. we show how the toric description of m 7 sug-
gests the gauge group and the supersingleton elds. the conformal dimensions of
the latter can be independently calculated by comparison with the mass of baryonic
operators that correspond to 5branes wrapped on supersymmetric 5cycles and
are charged with respect to the betti multiplets. the entire kaluza klein spectrum
of short multiplets agrees with these dimensions. furthermore, the metric cone
over the sasakian manifold is a conifold algebraically embedded in some cp. the
ring of chiral primary elds is dened as the coordinate ring of cp modded by the
ideal generated by the embedding equations; this ideal has a nice characterization
by means of representation theory. the entire kaluza klein spectrum is explained
in terms of these vanishing relations. we give the supereld interpretation of all
short multiplets and we point out the existence of many long multiplets with ratio-
nal protected dimensions, whose presence and pattern seem to be universal in all
compactications.

2 introduction

the basic principle of the ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3] states that every consistent
m-theory or type ii background with metric adsp+2  m dp2 in d-dimensions, where
m dp2 is an einstein manifold, is associated with a conformal quantum eld theory
living on the boundary of adsp+2. the background is typically generated by the near
horizon geometry of a set of p-branes and the boundary conformal eld theory is identied
with the ir limit of the gauge theory living on the world-volume of the p-branes. one
remarkable example with n = 1 supersymmetry on the boundary and with a non-trivial
smooth manifold m 5 = t 1,1 was found in [4] and the associated superconformal theory
was identied. some general properties and the complete spectrum of the t 1,1 compacti-
cation have been discussed in [5, 6, 7], nding complete agreement between gauge theory
expectations and supergravity predictions. in this paper we will focus on the case p = 2
when m is a coset manifold g/h with n = 2 supersymmetry.
backgrounds of the form ads4 m 7 arise as the near horizon geometry of a collection
of m2-branes in m-theory. the n = 8 supersymmetric case corresponds to m 7 = s7.
examples of superconformal theories with less supersymmetry can be obtained by orb-
ifolding the m2-brane solution [8, 9]. orbifold models have the advantage that the gauge
theory can be directly obtained as a quotient of the n = 8 theory using standard tech-
niques [10]. on the other hand, the internal manifold m 7 is s7 divided by some discrete
group and it is generically singular. smooth manifolds m 7 can be obtained by consid-
ering m2-branes sitting at the singular point of the cone over m 7, c(m 7) [4, 11, 12].
many examples where m 7 is a coset manifold g/h were studied in the old days of
kk theories [13] (see [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] for the cases s7 and squashed
s7, see [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28] for the case m p,q,r, see [29, 30] for the case q1,1,1, see
[25, 31, 32, 33, 22] for general methods of harmonic analysis in compactication and the
structure of osp(n|4) supermultiplets, and nally see [34] for a complete classication of
g/h compactications.)
for obvious reason, ads4 was much more investigated in those days than his simpler
cousin ads5. as a consequence, we have a plethora of ads4  g/h compactications for
which the dual superconformal theory is still to be found. if we require supersymmetric
solutions, which are guaranteed to be stable and are simpler to study, and furthermore
we require 2  n  8, we nd four examples: n 0,1,0 with n = 3 and q1,1,1, m 1,1,1, v5,2
with n = 2 supersymmetry. these are the natural ads4 counterparts of the t 1,1 conifold
theory studied in [4].
in this paper we shall consider in some detail the two cases q1,1,1 and m 1,1,1. they
have isometry su(2)3  u(1) and su(3)  su(2)  u(1), respectively. the isometry of
these manifolds corresponds to the global symmetry of the dual superconformal theories,
including the u(1) r-symmetry of n = 2 supersymmetry. the complete spectrum of
11-dimensional supergravity compactied on m 1,1,1 has been recently computed [35, 36].
the analogous spectrum for q1,1,1 has not been computed yet 1, but several partial results
exist in the literature [37], which will be enough for our purpose. the kk spectrum should
match the spectrum of the gauge theory operators of nite dimension in the large n limit.
as a dierence with the maximally supersymmetric case, the kk spectrum contains both
short and long operators; this is a characteristic feature of n = 2 supersymmetry and
was already found in ads5  t 1,1 [5, 7].

1this spectrum is presently under construction [38]

3

we will show that the spectra on q1,1,1 and m 1,1,1 share several common features with
their cousin t 1,1. first of all, the kk spectrum is in perfect agreement with the spectrum
of operators of a superconformal theory with a set of fundamental supersingleton elds
inherited from the geometry of the manifold.
in the abelian case this is by no means
a surprise because of the well known relations among harmonic analysis, representation
theory and holomorphic line bundles over algebraic homogeneous spaces. the non-abelian
case is more involved. there is no straightforward method to identify the gauge theory
living on m2-branes placed at the singularity of c(m 7) when the space is not an orbifold.
hence we shall use intuition from toric geometry to write candidate gauge theories that
have the right global symmetries and a spectrum of short operators which matches the
kk spectrum. some points that still need to be claried are pointed out.

a second remarkable property of these spaces is the existence of non-trivial cycles and
non-perturbative states, obtained by wrapping branes, which are identied with baryons
in the gauge theory [39]. the corresponding baryonic u(1) symmetry is associated with
the so-called betti multiplets [31, 26]. the conformal dimension of a baryon can be
computed in supergravity, following [6], and unambiguously predicts the dimension of the
fundamental conformal elds of the theory in the ir. the result from the baryon analysis
is remarkably in agreement with the expectations from the kk spectrum. this can be
considered as a highly non-trivial check of the ads/cft correspondence. moreover we
will also notice that, as it happens on t 1,1 [5, 7], there exists a class of long multiplets
which, against expectations, have a protected dimension which is rational and agrees with
a naive computation. there seems to be a common pattern for the appearance of these
operators in all the various models.

3 conifolds and three-dimensional theories

3.1 the geometry of the conifolds

our purpose is to study a collection of m2-branes sitting at the singular point of the
conifold c(m 7), where m 7 = q1,1,1 or m 7 = m 1,1,1. while for branes sitting at orbifold
singularities there is a straightforward method for identifying the gauge theory living
on the world-volume [10], for conifold singularities much less is known [40, 12]. the
strategy of describing the conifold as a deformation of an orbifold singularity used in
[4, 12] and identifying the superconformal theory as the ir limit of the deformed orbifold
theory, seems more dicult to be applied in three dimensions 2. we will then use the
intuition from geometry in order to identify the fundamental degrees of freedom of the
superconformal theory and to compare them with the results of the kk expansion.

we expect to nd the superconformal xed points dual to ads-compactications as
the ir limits of three-dimensional gauge theories.
in the maximally supersymmetric
case ads4  s7, for example, the superconformal theory is the ir limit of the n = 8
in three dimensions, the gauge coupling constant is
supersymmetric gauge theory [1].
dimensionful and a gauge theory is certainly not conformal. however, the theory becomes
conformal in the ir, where the coupling constant blows up.
in this simple case, the
identication of the superconformal theory living on the world-volume of the m2-branes

2see however [42] where a similar approach for q1,1,1 was attempted without, however, providing a

match with kaluza klein spectra. another partial attempt in this direction was also given in [43].

4

follows from considering m-theory on a circle. the m2-branes become d2-branes in type
iia, whose world-volume supports the n = 8 gauge theory with a dimensionful coupling
constant related to the radius of the circle. the near horizon geometry of d2-branes is not
anymore ads [44], since the theory is not conformal. the ads background and conformal
invariance is recovered by sending the radius to innity; this corresponds to sending the
gauge theory coupling to innity and probing the ir of the gauge theory.

we expect a similar behaviour for other three dimensional gauge theories. as a dif-
ference with fourdimensional cfts corresponding to ads5 backgrounds, which always
have exact marginal directions labeled by the coupling constants (the type iib dilaton is
a free parameter of the supergravity solution), these three dimensional xed points may
also be isolated. the only universal parameter in m-theory compactications is p , which
is related to the number of colors n, that is also the number of m2-branes. the 1/n
expansion in the gauge theory corresponds to the rads/p expansion of m-theory through
the relation rads/p  n 1/6 [1]. for large n, the m-theory solution is weakly coupled
and supergravity can be used for studying the gauge theory.
the relevant degrees of freedom at the superconformal xed points are in general
dierent from the elementary elds of the supersymmetric gauge theory. for example,
vector multiplets are not conformal in three dimensions and they should be replaced
by some other multiplets of the superconformal group by dualizing the vector eld to a
scalar. let us again consider the simple example of n = 8. the degrees of freedom at
the superconformal point (the singletons, in the language of representation theory of the
superconformal group) are contained in a supermultiplet with eight real scalars and eight
fermions, transforming in representations of the global r-symmetry so(8). this is the
same content of the n = 8 vector multiplet, when the vector eld is dualized into a scalar.
the change of variable from a vector to a scalar, which is well-dened in an abelian theory,
is obviously a non-trivial and not even well-dened operation in a non-abelian theory. the
scalars in the supersingleton parametrize the at space transverse to the m2-branes. in
this case, the moduli space of vacua of the abelian n = 8 gauge theory, corresponding
to a single m2-brane, is isomorphic to the transverse space. the case with n m2-branes
is obtained by promoting the theory to a non-abelian one. we want to follow a similar
procedure for the conifold cases.

for branes at the conifold singularity of c(m 7) there is no obvious way of reducing the
system to a simple conguration of d2-branes in type iia and read the eld content by
using standard brane techniques 3. we can nevertheless use the intuition from geometry
for identifying the relevant degrees of freedom at the superconformal point. we need
an abelian gauge theory whose moduli space of vacua is isomorphic to c(m 7). the
moduli space of vacua of n = 2 theories have two dierent branches touching at a
point, the coulomb branch parametrized by the vev of the scalars in the vector multiplet
and the higgs branch parametrized by the vev of the scalars in the chiral multiplets.
the higgs branch is the one we are interested in. each of the two branches excludes
the other, so we can consistently set the scalars in the vector multiplets to zero (see
appendix a for a discussion of the scalar potential in general n = 2, d = 3 theories).
we can nd what we need in toric geometry. indeed, this latter describes certain complex
manifolds as kahler quotients associated to symplectic actions of a product of u(1)s on
some cp. this is completely equivalent to imposing the d-term equations for an abelian
3 this possibility exists for orbifold singularities and was exploited in [45, 8, 9] for n = 4 and in [46]

for n = 2.

5

n = 2, d = 3 gauge theory and dividing by the gauge group or, in other words, to
nding the moduli space of vacua of the theory. fortunately, both the cone over q1,1,1
and that over m 1,1,1 have a toric geometry description. this description was already
used for studying these spaces in [42, 43].
in this paper, we will consider a dierent
point of view. we can then easily nd abelian gauge theories whose moduli space of
vacua (the higgs branch component) is isomorphic to these two particular conifolds. in
the following subsections, we briey discuss the geometry of the two manifolds and the
abelian gauge theory associated with the toric description. more complete information
about the geometry and the homology of the manifolds are contained in part iii. here we
briey recall the basic information needed to discuss the matching of the kk spectrum
with the expectations from the conformal theory.

3.1.1 the case of q1,1,1
q1,1,1, originally introduced as a d = 11 compactifying solution with n = 2 susy in [29],
is a specic instance in the family of the qp,q,r manifolds, that are all of the form:

su(2)  su(2)  su(2)

u(1)  u(1)

.

(3.1)

the cone over q1,1,1 is a toric manifold obtained as the kahler quotient of c6 by the
symplectic action of two u(1)s. explicitly, it is described as the solution of the following
two dterm equations (momentum map equations in mathematical language)

|a1|2 + |a2|2 = |b1|2 + |b2|2
|b1|2 + |b2|2 = |c1|2 + |c2|2

(3.2)

modded by the action of the corresponding two u(1)s, the rst acting only on ai with
charge +1 and on bi with charge 1, the second acting only on bi with charge +1 and
on ci with charge 1.
the manifold q1,1,1 can be obtained by setting each term in (3.2) equal to 1, i.e.
as s3  s3  s3/u(1)  u(1). this corresponds to taking a section of the cone at a
xed value of the radial coordinate (an horizon in morrison and plessers language [12]).
indeed, in full generality, this radial coordinate is identied with the fourth coordinate of
ads4, while the section is identied with the internal manifold 4 m 7 [47, 4].

given the toric description, the identication of an abelian n = 2 gauge theory whose
higgs branch reproduces the conifold is straightforward. equations (3.2) are the d-terms
for the abelian theory u(1)3 with doublets of chiral elds ai with charges (1,1, 0), bi
with charge (0, 1,1) and ci with charges (1, 0, 1) and without superpotential. the
theory has an obvious global symmetry su(2)3 matching the isometry of q1,1,1. we
introduced three u(1) factors (one more than those appearing in the toric data, as the
attentive reader certainly noticed) for symmetry reasons. one of the three u(1)s is

4in the solvable lie algebra parametrization of ads4 [48, 49] the radial coordinate is algebraically
characterized as being associated with the cartan semisimple generator, while the remaining three are
associated with the three nilpotent generators spanning the brane world volume. so we have a natural
splitting of ads4 into 3 + 1 which mirrors the natural splitting of the eight dimensional conifold into
1 + 7. the radial coordinate is shared by the two spaces. this phenomenon, that is the algebraic basis for
the existence of smooth m2 brane solutions with horizon geometry ads4  m 7, was named dimensional
transmigration in [48].

6

decoupled and has no role in our discussion. since we do not expect a decoupled u(1) in
the world-volume theory of m2-branes living at the conifold singularity, we should better
consider the theory u(1)3/u(1)diagonal.

the elds appearing in the toric description should represent the fundamental degrees
of freedom of the superconformal theory, since they appear as chiral elds in the gauge
theory. they have denite transformation properties under the gauge groups. out of
them we can also build some gauge invariant combinations, which should represent the
composite operators of the conformal theory and which should be matched with the kk
spectrum. geometrically, this corresponds to describing the cone as an ane subvariety
of some cp. this is a standard procedure, which converts the denition of a toric manifold
in terms of d-terms to an equivalent one in terms of binomial equations in cp. in this
case, we have an embedding in c8. we rst construct all the u(1) invariants (in this case
there are 8 = 2  2  2 of them)

x ijk = aibjc k,

i, j, k = 1, 2.

(3.3)

5

2, j2 = 1

they satisfy a set of binomial equations which cut out the image of our conifold c(q1,1,1)
in c8. these equations are actually the 9 quadrics explicitely written in eq.s (7.72) of part
iii. indeed, there is a general method to obtain the embedding equations of the cones
over algebraic homogeneous varieties based on representation theory.
if we want to
summarize this general method in few words, we can say the following. through eq. (3.3)
we see that the coordinates x ijk of c8 are assigned to a certain representation r of the
isometry group su(2)3. in our case such a representation is r = (j1 = 1
2, j3 = 1
2).
the products x i1j1k1x i2j2k2 belong to the symmetric product sym2(r), which in general
branches into various representations, one of highest weight plus several subleading ones.
on the cone, however, only the highest weight representation survives while all the sub-
leading ones vanish. imposing that such subleading representations are zero corresponds
to writing the embedding equations. this has far reaching consequences in the conformal
eld theory, since provides the denition of the chiral ring. in principle all the represen-
tations appearing in the k-th symmetric tensor power of r could correspond to primary
conformal operators. yet the attention should be restricted to those that do not vanish
modulo the equations of the cone, namely modulo the ideal generated by the represen-
tations of subleading weights.
in other words, only the highest weight representation
contained in the symk(r) gives a true chiral operator. this is what matches the kaluza
klein spectra found through harmonic analysis. two points should be stressed. in general
the number of embedding equations is larger than the codimension of the algebraic locus.
for instance 8 4 < 9, i.e. the cone is not a complete intersection. the 9 equations (7.72)
dene the ideal i of c[x] := c[x 111, . . . , x 222] cutting the cone c(q1,1,1). the second
point to stress is the double interpretation of the embedding equations. the fact that
q1,1,1 leads to n = 2 supersymmetry means that it is sasakian, i.e. it is a circle bundle
over a suitable complex threefold. if considered in c8 the ideal i cuts out the conifold
c(q1,1,1). being homogeneous, it can also be regarded as cutting out an algebraic variety
in p7. this is p1  p1  p1, namely the base of the u(1) bre-bundle q1,1,1.
it follows from this discussion that the invariant operators x ijk of eq. (3.3) can be
naturally associated with the building blocks of the gauge invariant composite operators of

5the 9 equations were already mentioned in [42] although their representation theory interpretation

was not given there.

7

our cft. holomorphic combinations of the x ijk should span the set of chiral operators of
the theory. as we stated above, the set of embedding equations (7.72) impose restrictions
on the allowed representations of su(2)3 and hence on the existing operators.
if we
put the denition of x ijk in terms of the fundamental elds a, b, c into the equations
(7.72), we see that they are automatically satised when the theory is abelian. since we
want eventually to promote a, b, c to non-abelian elds, these equations become non-
trivial because the elds do not commute anymore. they essentially assert that the chiral
operators we may construct out of the x ijk are totally symmetric in the exchange of the
various a, b, c, that is they belong to the highest weight representations we mentioned
above.

it is clear that the two dierent geometric descriptions of the conifold, the rst in
terms of the variables a, b, c and the second in terms of the x, correspond to the two
possible parametrization of the moduli space of vacua of an n = 2 theory, one in terms of
vevs of the fundamental elds and the second in terms of gauge invariant chiral operators.
we notice that this discussion closely parallels the analogous one in [4, 50]. q1,1,1 is

indeed a close relative of t 1,1.

3.1.2 the case of m 1,1,1

m 1,1,1 is a specic instance in the family of the m p,q,r manifolds, that are all of the form
(see [24]):

su(3)  su(2)  u(1)
su(2)  u(1)  u(1)
the details of the embedding are given in section 7.1.2.

.

(3.4)

the cone over m 1,1,1 is a toric manifold obtained as a kahler quotient of c5, described

as the solution of the d-term equation

2(cid:0)|u1|2 + |u2|2 + |u3|2(cid:1) = 3(cid:0)|v1|2 + |v2|2(cid:1)

modded by the action of a u(1), acting on ui with charge +2 and on vi with charge 3.
the manifold m 1,1,1 can be obtained by setting both terms of equation (3.5) equal to 1.
given the toric description, we can identify the corresponding abelian n = 2 gauge
theory. equation (3.5) is the d-term for the abelian theory u(1)2 with a triplet of chiral
elds ui with charges (2,2), a doublet vi with charge (3, 3) and without superpotential.
the theory has an obvious global symmetry su(3)su(2)u(1) matching the isometry
of m 1,1,1. again, we introduced two u(1) factors for symmetry reasons. one of them is
decoupled and we should better consider the theory u(1)2/u(1)diagonal.

the elds u, v should represent the fundamental degrees of freedom of the super-
conformal theory, since they appear as chiral elds in the gauge theory. as before, we
can nd a second representation of our manifold in terms of an embedding in some cp
with coordinates representing the chiral composite operators of our cft. in this case,
we have an embedding in c30. we again construct all the u(1) invariants (in this case
there are 30 of them) and we nd that they are assigned to the (10, 3) of su(3) su(2).
the embedding equations of the conifold into c30 correspond to the statement that in the
clebschgordon expansion of the symmetric product (10, 3)s (10, 3) all representations
dierent from the highest weight one should vanish. this yields 325 equations grouped
into 5 irreducible representations (see section 7.1.2 for details).

8

as in the q1,1,1 case, the x ij|ab can be associated with the building blocks of the
gauge invariant composite operators of our cft and the ideal generated by the embedding
equations (7.9) (see section 7.1.2) imposes many restrictions on the existing conformal
operators. actually, as we try to make clear in the explicit comparison with kaluza klein
data (see section ii), the entire spectrum is fully determined by the structure of the ideal
above. indeed, as it should be clear from the previous group theoretical description of the
embedding equations, the result of the constraints is to select chiral operators which are
totally symmetrized in the su(3) and su(2) indices.

4 the non-abelian theory and the comparison with

kk spectrum

in the previous section, we explicitly constructed an abelian theory whose moduli space
of vacua reproduces the cone over the two manifolds q1,1,1 and m 1,1,1. these can be easily
promoted to non-abelian ones. once this is done, we can compare the expected spectrum
of short operators in the cft with the kk spectrum. in this section we compare only
the chiral operators. the comparison of the full spectrum, which is known only for m 1,1,1,
will be done in part ii.

4.1 the case of q1,1,1
the theory for q1,1,1 becomes su(n) su(n)  su(n) with three series of chiral elds
in the following representations of the gauge group

ai :

(n, n, 1),

bl :

(1, n, n),

cp :

( n, 1, n) .

(4.1)

the eld content can be conveniently encoded in a quiver diagram, where nodes represent
the gauge groups and links matter elds in the bi-fundamental representation of the
groups they are connecting. the quiver diagram for q1,1,1 is pictured in gure 1. the

figure 1: gauge group su(n)1su(n)2su(n)3 and color representation assignments
of the supersingleton elds ai, bj, c in the q1,1,1 world volume gauge theory.

global symmetry of the gauge theory is su(2)3, where each of the doublets of chiral elds
transforms in the fundamental representation of one of the su(2)s.

9

notice that we are considering su(n) gauge group and not the naively expected
u(n). the reason is that there is compelling evidence [3, 53, 39] that the u(1) factors
are washed out in the near horizon limit. since in three dimensions u(1) theories may
give rise to cfts in the ir, it is an important point to check whether u(1) factors are
described by the ads-solution or not. a rst piece of evidence that the supergravity
solutions are dual to su(n) theories, and not u(n), comes from the absence in the kk
spectrum (even in the maximal supersymmetric case) of kk modes corresponding to color
trace of single fundamental elds of the cft, which are non zero only for u(n) gauge
groups. a second evidence is the existence of states dual to baryonic operators in the
non-perturbative spectrum of these type ii or m-theory compactications; baryons exist
only for su(n) groups. we will nd baryons in the spectrum of both q1,1,1 and m 1,1,1:
this implies that, for the compactications discussed in this paper, the gauge group of the
cft is su(n).

in the non-abelian case, we expect that the generic point of the moduli space corre-
sponds to n separated branes. therefore, the space of vacua of the theory should reduce
to the symmetrization of n copies of q1,1,1. to get rid of unwanted light non-abelian
degrees of freedom, we would like to introduce, following [4], a superpotential for our
theory. unfortunately, the obvious candidate for this job

ijmnpqtr(aibmcpajbncq)

(4.2)

is identically zero. here the close analogy with t 1,1 and reference [4] ends.

we consider now the spectrum of kk excitations of q1,1,1. the full spectrum of q1,1,1
is not known; however, the eigenvalues of the laplacian were computed in [37]. as shown
in [35], the knowledge of the laplacian eigenvalues allows to compute the entire spectrum
of hypermultiplets of the theory, corresponding to the chiral operators of the cft. the
result is that there is a chiral multiplet in the (k/2, k/2, k/2) representation of su(2)3 for
each integer value of k, with dimension e0 = k. we naturally associate these multiplets
with the series of composite operators

tr(abc)k,

(4.3)

where the su(2)s indices are totally symmetrized. a rst important result, following
from the existence of these hypermultiplets in the kk spectrum, is that the dimension of
the combination abc at the superconformal point must be 1.

we see that the prediction from the kk spectrum are in perfect agreement with the
geometric discussion in the previous section. operators which are not totally symmetric in
the avor indices do not appear in the spectrum. the agreement with the proposed cft,
however, is only partial. the chiral operators predicted by supergravity certainly exist in
the gauge theory. however, we can construct many more chiral operators which are not
symmetric in avor indices. they do not have any counterpart in the kk spectrum. the
superpotential in the case of t 1,1 [4] had the double purpose of getting rid of the unwanted
non-abelian degrees of freedom and of imposing, via the equations of motion, the total
symmetrization for chiral and short operators which is predicted both by geometry and
by supergravity. here, we are not so lucky, since there is no superpotential. we can not
consider superpotentials of dimension bigger than that considered before (for example,
cubic or quartic in abc) because the superpotential
(4.2) is the only one which has
dimension compatible with the supergravity predictions. 6 we need to suppose that all

6for a three dimensional theory to be conformal the dimension of the superpotential must be 2.

10

the non symmetric operators are not conformal primary. since the relation between r-
charge and dimension is only valid for conformal chiral operators, such operators are not
protected and therefore may have enormous anomalous dimension, disappearing from the
spectrum. simple examples of chiral but not conformal operators are those obtained by
derivatives of the superpotential. since we do not have a superpotential here, we have
to suppose that both the elimination of the unwanted colored massless states as well as
the disappearing of the non-symmetric chiral operators emerges as an non-perturbative
ir eect.

4.2 the case of m 1,1,1
let us now consider m 1,1,1. the non-abelian theory is now su(n)  su(n) with chiral
matter in the following representations of the gauge group

u i  sym2(cn )  sym2(cn),

v a  sym3(cn)  sym3(cn ).

(4.4)

the representations of the fundamental elds have been chosen in such a way that they re-
duce to the abelian theory discussed in the previous section, match with the kk spectrum
and imply the existence of baryons predicted by supergravity. comparison with super-
gravity, which will be made soon, justies, in particular, the choice of color symmetric
representations.

the eld content can be conveniently encoded in the quiver diagram in gure 2.

figure 2: gauge group u(n)1  u(n)2 and color representation assignments of the su-
persingleton elds v a and u i in the m 1,1,1 world volume gauge theory.

the global symmetry of the gauge theory is su(3)  su(2), with the chiral elds u
and v transforming in the fundamental representation of su(3) and su(2), respectively.
we next compare the expectations from gauge theory with the kk spectrum [35].
let us start with the hypermultiplet spectrum (the full spectrum of kk modes will be
discussed in part ii). there is exactly one hypermultiplet in the symmetric representation
of su(3) with 3k indices and the symmetric representation of su(2) with 2k indices, for
each integer k  1. the dimension of the operator is e0 = 2k. we naturally identify
these states with the totally symmetrized chiral operators

tr(u 3v 2)k.

11

(4.5)

one immediate consequence of the supergravity analysis is that the combination u 3v 2
has dimension 2 at the superconformal xed point.

once again, we are not able to write any superpotential of dimension 2. the natural

candidate is the dimension two avor singlet

ijkab(cid:0)u iu ju kv av b(cid:1) color singlet

(4.6)

which however vanishes identically. there is no superpotential that might help in the
elimination of unwanted light colored degrees of freedom and that might eliminate all the
non symmetric chiral operators that we can construct out of the fundamental elds. once
again, we have to suppose that, at the superconformal xed point in the ir, all the non
totally symmetric operators are not conformal primaries.

4.3 the baryonic symmetries and the betti multiplets

there is one important property that m 1,1,1, q1,1,1 and t 1,1 share. these manifolds have
non-zero betti numbers (b2 = b5 = 2 for q1,1,1, b2 = b5 = 1 for m 1,1,1 and b2 = b3 = 1 for
t 1,1). this implies the existence of non-perturbative states in the supergravity spectrum
associated with branes wrapped on non-trivial cycles. they can be interpreted as baryons
in the cft [39, 6].

the existence of non-zero betti numbers implies the existence of new global u(1)
symmetries which do not come from the geometrical symmetries of the coset manifold,
as was pointed out long time ago. the massless vector multiplets associated with these
symmetries were discovered and named betti multiplets in [31, 26]. they have the prop-
erty that the entire kk spectrum is neutral and only non-perturbative states can be
charged. the massless vectors, dual to the conserved currents, arise from the reduction
of the 11-dimensional 3-form along the non-trivial 2-cycles. this denition implies that
non-perturbative objects made with m2 and m5 branes are charged under these u(1)
symmetries.

we can identify the betti multiplets with baryonic symmetries. this was rst pointed
out in [59, 7] for the case of t 1,1 and discussed for orbifold models in [12]. the existence
of baryons in the proposed cfts is due to the choice of su(n) (as opposed to u(n))
as gauge group. in the su(n) case, we can form the gauge invariant operators det (a),
det (b) and det (c) for q1,1,1 and det (u) and det (v ) for m 1,1,1. the baryon symmetries
act on elds in the same way as the u(1) factors that we used for dening our abelian
theories in sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2. they disappeared in the non-abelian theory associated
to the conifolds, but the very same fact that they can be consistently incorporated in the
theory means that they must exist as global symmetries.
it is easy to check that no
operator corresponding to kk states is charged under these u(1)s. the reason is that
the kk spectrum is made out with the combinations x = abc or x = u 3v 2 dened
in sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 which, by denition, are u(1) invariant variables. the only
objects that are charged under the u(1) symmetries are the baryons.

baryons have dimensions which diverge with n and can not appear in the kk spec-
trum. they are indeed non-perturbative objects associated with wrapped branes [39, 6].
we see that the baryonic symmetries have the right properties to be associated with the
betti multiplets: the only charged objects are non-perturbative states. this identica-
tion can be strengthened by noticing that the only non-perturbative branes in m-theory
have an electric or magnetic coupling to the eleven dimensional three-form. since for our

12

manifolds, both b2 and b5 are greater than 0, we have the choice of wrapping both m2
and m5-branes. m2 branes wrapped around a non-trivial two-cycle are certainly charged
under the massless vector in the betti multiplet which is obtained by reducing the three-
form on the same cycle. since a non-trivial 5-cycle is dual to a 2-cycle, a similar remark
applies also for m5-branes. we identify m5-branes as baryons because they have a mass
(and therefore a conformal dimension) which goes like n, as discussed in section 5.2.

what follows from the previous discussion and is probably quite general, is that there
is a close relation between the u(1)s entering the brane construction of the gauge theory,
the baryonic symmetries and the betti multiplets. the previous remarks apply as well
to cft associated with orbifolds of ads4  s7. in the case of t 1,1,q1,1,1 and m 1,1,1, the
baryonic symmetries are also directly related to the u(1)s entering the toric description
of the manifold.

4.4 non trivial results from supergravity: a discussion

in the previous sections, we proposed non-abelian theories as dual candidates for the m
theory compactication on q1,1,1 and m 1,1,1. we also pointed out the diculties related
to the existence of more candidate conformal chiral operators than those expected from
the kk spectrum analysis. we have no good arguments for claiming that these non avor
symmetric operators disappear in the ir limit. if they survive, this certainly signals the
need for modifying our guess for the dual cfts. in the latter case, new elds may be
needed. the theories we wrote down are based on the minimal assumption that there
is no superpotential in the abelian case7; if we relax this assumption, more complicated
candidate dual gauge theories may exist. in the case of t 1,1, the cft was identied in two
dierent ways, by using the previous section arguments and also by describing the conifold
as a deformation of an orbifold singularity. since orbifold cft can be often identied using
standard techniques [10], this approach has the advantage of unambiguously identifying
the conifold cft. it would be interesting to nd an analogous procedure for the case
of ads4. it would provide a cft which ows in the ir to the conifold theory after a
deformation [4, 12] and it would help in checking whether new elds are necessary or not
for a correct description of the cfts. attempts to nd associated orbifold models in the
case of q1,1,1 have been made in [42, 43]; the precise relation with our approach is still to
be claried 8.

in any event, whatever is the microscopic description of the gauge theory owing to
the superconformal points in the ir, it is reasonable to think all the relevant degrees of
freedom at the superconformal xed point corresponding to the m theory on q1,1,1 and
m 1,1,1 has been identied in the previous geometrical analysis. we will make, from now
on, the assumption that the fundamental singletons of the cft for q1,1,1 are the elds
a, b, c and for m 1,1,1 the elds u, v with the previously discussed assignment of color and
avor indices and that they always appear in totally symmetrized avor combinations.
given this simple assumption, inherited from the geometry of the conifolds, we can make
several non-trivial comparisons between the expectation of a cft (in which the singletons
are totally symmetrized in avor) and the supergravity prediction. we leave for future

7if there is a superpotential the toric description may contain extra u (1)s related to the f-terms of

the theories, as it happens for orbifold models [41].

8a dierent cft was proposed for the case of q1,1,1 in [42]; this dierent proposal does not seem to

solve the discrepancies with the kk expectations.

13

work the clarication of the dynamical mechanism (or possible modication of the three-
dimensional gauge theories) for suppressing the non-symmetric operators as well as the
search for a rg ow from an orbifold model.

we already discussed the chiral operators of the two cfts. we obtained two main
results from this analysis. the rst one states that all chiral operators are symmetrized
in avor indices. the second one, more quantitative, predicts the conformal dimension
of some composite objects. when appearing in gauge invariant chiral operators, the
symmetrized combinations abc and u 3v 2 have dimensions 1 and 2, respectively.

having this information, there are two types of important and non-trivial checks that

we can make:

 the full spectrum of kk excitations should match with composite operators in the
cft. specically, besides the hypermultiplets, there are many other short multi-
plets in the spectrum. all these multiplets should match with cft operators with
protected dimension. this will be veried in sections 6.3, 6.4.

 we can determine the dimension of a baryon operator by computing the volume
of the cycle the m5-brane is wrapping, following [6]. from this, we can determine
the dimension of the fundamental elds of the cft. this can be compared with
the expectations from the kk spectrum. the agreement of the two methods can
be considered as a non-trivial check of the ads/cft correspondence. this will be
discussed in section 5.

leaving the actual computation and detailed comparison of spectra for the second

part of this paper, here we summarize the results of our analysis.

the spectrum of m 1,1,1 is completely known [35]. this allows a detailed comparison
of all the states in supergravity with cft operators. besides the hypermultiplets, which
t the quantum eld theory expectations in a straightforward manner, there are various
series of multiplets which are short and therefore protected. an highly non-trivial result is
that we will be able to identify all the kk short multiplets with candidate cft operators
of requested quantum numbers and conformal dimension. most of them can be obtained
by tensoring conserved currents with chiral operators. a similar analysis was done for
t 1,1 in [7]. in n = 2 supersymmetric compactications, the kk spectrum contains both
short and long multiplets. we will notice that there is a common pattern in q1,1,1, m 1,1,1
as well as in t 1,1, of long multiplets which have rational and protected dimension.
in
particular, we can identify in all these models rational long gravitons with products of the
stress energy tensor, conserved currents and chiral operators. we suspect the existence of
some eld theoretical reason for the unexpected protected dimension of these operators.
the dimension of the fundamental elds a, b, c and u, v at the superconformal point
can be computed and compared with the kk spectrum prediction. in the kk spectrum,
these elds always appear in particular combinations. for example, we already know
that abc has dimension 1 and u 3v 2 has dimension 2. a, b, c have clearly the same
dimension 1/3 since there is a permutation symmetry. but, whats about u or v ? from
the cft point of view, we expect the existence of several baryon operators: det a, det b,
det c for q1,1,1 and det u, det v for m 1,1,1. all of them should correspond to m5-branes
wrapped on supersymmetric ve-cycles of m 7. we can determine the dimension of the
single elds a or u by computing the mass of a wrapped m5-brane [6]. this amounts
to identifying a supersymmetric 5-cycle and computing its volume. the details of the

14

identication of the cycles, the actual computation of normalizations and volumes will be
discussed in sections 7.1.5, 7.1.6, 7.1.7, 7.2.4. here we give the results.

in the case of q1,1,1, since the manifold is a u(1) bration over s2  s2  s2, we can
identify three distinct supersymmetric 5-cycles by considering the 5-manifolds obtained
by selecting a particular point in one of the three s2. the computation of volumes
predicts a common dimension n/3 for the three candidate baryons det a, det b and
det c. we conclude that the three fundamental elds a, b, c have dimension 1/3. both
the dimension and the avor representation of these baryons, which will be determined
in section 5, are in agreement with the kk expectations.

in the case of m 1,1,1, there are two supersymmetric cycles. m 1,1,1 is a u(1) bration
over p1p2. a rst non-trivial supersymmetric 5-cycle is obtained by selecting a point in
p1; the associated baryon carries avor indices of su(2). a second 5-cycle is obtained by
selecting a p1 inside p2 (see section 7.1.6); the associated baryon only carries indices of
su(3). we can determine the dimensions of the baryons det u and det v , by computing
the volume of these 5-cycles, and we nd 4n/9 and n/3, predicting dimension 4/9 and
1/3 for u and v . this strange numbers are nevertheless in perfect agreement with the
kk expectation: the dimension of u 3v 2 is

4

3 

+ 2

= 2,

(4.7)

as expected from the kk analysis. we nd that this is quite a non-trivial and remarkable
check of the ads/cft correspondence.

let us nish this brief discussion, by considering the issue of possible marginal de-
formations of our cfts. a natural question is whether the proposed cfts belong to
a line of xed points or not. we already noticed that in three dimensions there is no
analogous of the ads5 dilaton and therefore we may expect that, in general, the cfts
related to ads4 are isolated xed points, if we pretend to maintain the global symmetry
and the number of supersymmetries of our cfts. if there is some marginal deformation
we should be able to see it in the kk spectrum as an operator of dimension 3. we can
certainly exclude the existence of marginal deformations that preserves the global symme-
tries of the xed point, at least for m 1,1,1 where the kk spectrum is completely known:
there is no avor singlet scalar of dimension 3 in the supergravity spectrum. other possi-
ble sources for exact marginal deformations preserving the global symmetries come from
non-trivial cycles. in t 1,1, for example, the second complex marginal deformation arises
from the zero-mode value of the b eld on the non-trivial two-cycles of the manifold.
in our case, however, an analogous phenomenon requires reducing the three form on a
non-trivial 3-cycle, which does not exist. it is likely that marginal deformations which
break the avor symmetry but maintain the same number of supersymmetries exist in
all these models, since non avor singlet multiplets with highest component of dimension
three can be found in the kk spectrum; whether these deformation are truly marginal or
not needs to be investigated in more details.

the rest of this paper will be devoted to an exhaustive comparison between quantum
eld theory and supergravity and to a detailed description of the geometry involved in
such a comparison.

the interesting fact is that the conformal operators (5.2,...,5.6) can be reinterpreted
as solitonic supergravity states obtained by wrapping a 5brane on a nontrivial super-
symmetric 5cycle. this gives the possibility of calculating directly the mass of such
states and, as a byproduct, the conformal dimension of the individual supersingletons.
all what is involved is a geometrical information, namely the ratio of the volume of the 5
cycles to the volume of the entire compact 7manifold. in addition, studying the stability
subgroup of the supersymmetric 5cycles, we can also verify that the gaugetheory predic-
tions (5.8,...,5.12) for the avor representations are the same one obtains in supergravity
looking at the state as a wrapped solitonic 5brane.

to establish these results we need to derive a general massformula for baryonic states
corresponding to wrapped 5branes. this formula is obtained by considering various
relative normalizations.

5.1 the m2 brane solution and normalizations of the seven

manifold metric and volume

using the conventions and normalizations of [52, 55] for d = 11 supergravity and for
its kaluza klein expansions, a freund rubin solution on ads4  m 7 is described by the
following three equations:

(5.13)

where ea (a = 0, 1, 2, 3) is the vielbein of anti de sitter space ads4, rab is the correspond-
ing curvature 2form, ba (a = 4, . . . , 10) is the vielbein of m 7 and rab is the corresponding
curvature. the parameter e, expressing the vev of the 4form eld strength, is called the
freund rubin parameter. in these normalizations, both the internal and spacetime viel-
beins do not have their physical dimension of a length [ea]phys = [ba]phys = , since one
has reabsorbed the planck length p into their denition by working in natural units
where the d = 11 gravitational constant g11 has been set equal to 1

reinstalled through the following rescaling:

cb appearing in eq. (5.13). furthermore eq.s (5.13) were written in at indices
while eq.s (5.15, 5.16) are written in curved indices.

5.2 the dimension of the baryon operators

having xed the normalizations, we can now compute the mass of a m5-brane wrapped
around a non-trivial supersymmetric cycle of m 7 and the conformal dimension of the
associated baryon operator.

the parameter k appearing in the m2-solution is obviously proportional to the number
n of membranes generating the ads-background and, by dimensional analysis, to l6
p . the
exact relation for the maximally supersymmetric case ads4  s7 can be found in [1] and
reads

rads =

lp

2 (cid:0)252n(cid:1)1/6  k = 252nl6

p .

(5.25)

we can easily adapt this formula to the case of ads4  m 7 by noticing that, by
denition, the number of m2-branes n is determined by the ux of the rr three-form

through m 7, rm 7 f [4]. as a consequence, n and the volume of m 7 will appear in all

the relevant formulae in the combination n/vol(m 7). we therefore obtain the general
formula

r 

6

=(cid:18)vol(m 7)

vol(s7)(cid:19)1/6

1

lp (252n)1/6 .

(5.26)

we can now consider the solitonic particles in ads4 obtained by wrapping m2- and
m5-branes on the non-trivial 2- and 5-cycles of m 7, respectively. they are associated
with boundary operators with conformal dimensions that diverge in the large n limit.
the exact dependence on n can be easily estimated. without loss of generality, we can
put  = 1 using a conformal transformation; its only role in the game is to x a reference
scale and it will eventually cancel in the nal formulae. the mass of a p-brane wrapped
on a p-cycle is given by tp  vol(p  cycle)  l(p+1)
. once the mass of the
non-perturbative states is known, the dimension e0 of the associated boundary operator
is given by the relation m2 = (2/3)(e0  1)(e0  2)  2e2
0/3. from equation (5.26) we
learn that lp  n1/6. we see that m2-branes correspond to operators with dimension
n while m5-branes to operators with dimension of order n. the natural candidates
for the baryonic operators we are looking for are therefore the wrapped ve-branes.

we can easily write a more precise formula for the dimension of the baryonic operator
associated with a wrapped m5-brane, following the analogous computation in [6]. for
this, we need the exact expression for the m5 tension which can be found, for example,
in [56]. we nd

m =

vol(5  cycle).

(5.27)

using equation (5.26) and the above discussed relation between mass of the bulk
particle and conformal dimension of the associated boundary operators, we obtain the
formula for the dimension of a baryon,

e0 =

n


vol(5  cycle)

vol(m 7)

,

(5.28)

where the volume is evaluated with the internal metric normalized so that (5.16) is true.
as a check, we can compute the dimension of a pfaan operator in the n = 8 theory
with gauge group so(2n). the theory contains adjoint scalars which can be represented
as antisymmetric matrices ij and we can form the gauge invariant baryonic operator
i1,...,i2n i1i2....i2n 1i2n with dimension n/2. the internal manifold is rp7 [39, 57], a

19

supersymmetric preserving z2 projection of original ads4  s7 case, corresponding to
the su(n) gauge group. we obtain the pfaan by wrapping an m5-brane on a rp5
submanifold. equation (5.28) gives

e0 =

(5.29)

as expected.

let us now apply the above formula to the case of the theories m 1,1,1 and q1,1,1. in
section 7.1.5 we show that the sasakian manifold m 1,1,1 has two homology 5 cycles c1
and c2 (see their denition in eq.s (7.36, 7.37)) belonging to the unique homology class,
but distinguished by their stability subgroups h(c1,2)  su(3)  su(2)  u(1), respec-
tively given in eq.s (7.44) and (7.45). furthermore in section 7.1.7 we show that, after
being pulled back to these cycles, the supersymmetry projector of the 5brane is non
vanishing on the killing spinors of the supersymmetries preserved by m 1,1,1. this proves
that the 5brane wrapped on these cycles is a bp sstate with mass equal to its own
6form charge or, briey stated, that the 5cycles are supersymmetric. wrapping the
5brane on these cycles, we obtain good candidates for the supergravity representation of
the baryonic operators (5.2) and (5.3). to understand which is which, we have to decide
the avor representation. this is selected by the stability subgroup h(ci). following an
argument introduced by witten [39], the collective degrees of freedom c of the wrapped
5brane soliton live on the coset manifold g/h(ci), where g is the isometry group of
m 7. the wavefunction (c) of the soliton must be expanded in harmonics on g/h(ci)
characterized by having charge n under the baryon number u(1)b  h(ci). minimizing
the energy operator (the laplacian) on such harmonics one obtains the corresponding g
representation and hence the avor assignment of the baryon. in section 7.1.6, apply-
ing such a discussion to the pair of 5cycles under consideration, we nd that they are
respectively associated with the avor representations

c1  (m1 = 0, m2 = 0, j = n/2)
c2  (m1 = n, m2 = 0, j = 0)

(5.30)
(5.31)

(see eq.s (7.51), and (7.52)). comparing eq.s (5.30, 5.31) with eq.s (5.8, 5.9), we see that
the rst cycle is a candidate to represent the operator det u, while the second cycle is a
candidate to represent the operator det v . the nal check comes from the evaluation of
the cycle volumes. this is done in eq.s (7.38) and (7.39). inserting these results and the
formula (7.40) for the m 1,1,1 volume into the general formula (5.28), we obtain

e0 (det u) = 4
e0 (det u) = 1

9  n  h[u] = 4
9,
3  n  h[v ] = 1

(5.32)
(5.33)

as we have already stressed, it is absolutely remarkable that these nonperturbatively
determined conformal weights are in perfect agreement with the kaluza klein spectra as
we show in section 6.

in section 7.2.4 we show that the manifold q1,1,1 has three homology cycles ca,b,c
permuted by the 3 symmetry that characterizes this manifold. their volume is calculated
in eq. (7.83) and their stability subgroups in eq. (7.86). applying the same argument as
above, we show in section 7.2.4 that the avor representations associated with these three

20

cycles are indeed those of eq.s (5.10,...,5.12), so that these three cycles are candidates as
supergravity representations of the conformal operators det a, det b, and det c. inserting
the volume (7.83) of the cycles and the volume (7.84) of q1,1,1 into the baryon formula
(5.28), we nd that the conformal dimension of the a, b, c supersingletons is

h[ai] = h[bj] = h[c] =

(5.34)

as stated in eq. (7.88).

6 conformal superelds of the m 1,1,1 and q1,1,1 theo-

ries

starting from the choice of the supersingleton elds and of the chiral ring (inherited
from the geometry of the compact sasakian manifold), we can build all sort of candidate
conformal superelds for both theories m 1,1,1 and q1,1,1.
in the rst case, where the
full spectrum of osp(2|4) su(3)  su(2) supermultiplets has already been determined
through harmonic analysis [35], relying on the conversion vocabulary between ads4 bulk
supermultiplets and boundary superelds established in [36], we can make a detailed
comparison of the kaluza klein predictions with the candidate conformal superelds
available in the gauge theory. in particular we nd the gauge theory interpretation of the
entire spectrum of short multiplets. the corresponding short superelds are in the right
su(3)  su(2) representations and have the right conformal dimensions. applying the
same scheme to the case of q1,1,1, we can use the gauge theory to make predictions about
the spectrum of short multiplets one should nd in kaluza klein harmonic expansions.
the partial results already known from harmonic analysis on q1,1,1 are in agreement with
these predictions.

in addition, looking at the results of [35], one nds that there is a rich collection of
long multiplets whose conformal dimensions are rational and seem to be protected from
acquiring quantum corrections. this is in full analogy with similar results obtained in
the fourdimensional theory associated with the t 1,1 manifold [5, 7]. actually, we nd an
even larger class of such rational long multiplets. for a subclass of them the gauge theory
interpretation is clear while for others it is not immediate. their presence, which seems
universal in all coset models, indicates some general protection mechanism that has still
to be claried.

using the notations of [36], the singleton superelds of the m 1,1,1 theory are the

following ones:

u i|
v a|

(x, ) = ui|
(x, ) = va|

(x) + (

u)i|
(x) + (

 (x) +
 ,

v )a|

 (x) +
 ,

(6.1)

where (i, a) are su(3)  su(2) avor indices, (, ) are su(n)  su(n) color indices
while  is a world volume spinorial index of so(1, 2). the supersingletons are chiral
superelds, so they satisfy e0 = |y0|.
is in the fundamental representation 3 of su(3)avor and in the (, ) of
(su(n)  su(n))color. v a is in the fundamental representation 2 of su(2)avor and

u i

21

in the (, ) of (su(n)  su(n))color. in eq.s (6.1) we have followed the conven-
tions that lower su(n) indices transform in the fundamental representation, while upper
su(n) indices transform in the complex conjugate of the fundamental representation.

studying the non perturbative baryon state, obtained by wrapping the 5brane on
the supersymmetric cycles of m 1,1,1, we have unambiguously established the conformal
weights of the supersingletons (or, more precisely, the conformal weights of the cliord
vacua u, v) that are:

e0(u) = y0(u) =

4
9

, e0(v) = y0(v) =

3

.

for the q1,1,1 theory the singleton superelds are instead the following ones:

a 2
i1|1(x, ) = a 2
b 3
i2|2 (x, ) = b 3
c 1
i3|3 (x, ) = c 1

i1|1(x) + (
i2|2(x) + (
i3|3(x) + (

a ) 2
i1|1 (x) +
 ,
b ) 3
i2|2 (x) +
 ,
c ) 1
i3|3 (x) +
 ,

(6.2)

(6.3)

where i ( = 1, 2, 3) are avor indices of su(2)1  su(2)2  su(2)3, while  ( = 1, 2, 3)
are color indices of su(n)1su(n)2su(n)3. also in this case we know the conformal
dimension of the supersingleton elds through the calculation of the conformal dimension
of the baryon operators. we have:

e0(a) = e0(b) = e0(c) = y0(a) = y0(b) = y0(c) =

(6.4)

6.1 chiral operators

when the gauge group is u(1)n , there is a simple interpretation for the ring of the chiral
superelds: they describe the oscillations of the m2branes in the 7 compact transverse
directions, so they should have the form of a parametric description of the manifold. as
we explain in section 7.1.2, m 1,1,1 embedded in p29, can be parametrized by

x ijl|ab = u iu ju kv av b.

(6.5)

furthermore, the embedding equations can be reformulated in the following way. in a
product

x i1j1l1|a1b1 x i2j2l2|a2b2 . . . x ikjklk|akbk

(6.6)
only the highest weight representation of su(3)su(2), that is the completely symmetric
in the su(3) indices and completely symmetric in the su(2) indices, survives. so, as
advocated in eq. (7.23), the ring of the chiral superelds should be composed by superelds
of the form

(i1j1l1...ikjklk)(a1b1...akbk) = u i1u j1u l1v a1v b1 . . . u ik u jku lk v akv bk

.

(6.7)

first of all, we note that a product of supersingletons is always a chiral supereld, that
is, a eld satisfying the equation (see [36])

following the notations of [35], we identify the avor representations with three nonneg-
ative integers m1, m2, 2j, where m1, m2 count the boxes of an su(3) young diagram
according to

m1 = 3k
m2 = 0
j = k
e0 = y0 = 2k

3(cid:19) = 2,

while j is the usual isospin quantum number and counts the boxes of an su(2) young
diagram as follows

.

(6.12)
(6.13)

the superelds (6.7) are in the same osp(2|4)  su(3)  su(2) representations as the
bulk hypermultiplets that were determined in [35] through harmonic analysis:

k > 0 .

(6.14)

in particular, it is worth noticing that every block uuuv v is in the (, )avor and
has conformal weight

(6.15)

as in the kaluza klein spectrum. as a matter of fact, the conformal weight of a product
of chiral elds equals the sum of the weights of the single components, as in a free eld
theory. this is due to the relation e0 = |y0| satised by the chiral superelds and to the
additivity of the hypercharge.
when the gauge group is promoted to su(n)su(n), the coordinates become tensors
(see (6.1)). our conclusion about the composite operators is that the only primary chiral
superelds are those which preserve the structure (6.7). so, for example, the lowest lying
operator is:

u 

i|(u 

j|u 

|)v 

a|(v 

b|),

(6.16)

where the color indices of every su(n) are symmetrized. the generic primary chiral su-
pereld has the form (6.7), with all the color indices symmetrized before being contracted.
the choice of symmetrizing the color indices is not arbitrary: if we impose symmetrization
on the avor indices, it necessarily follows that also the color indices are symmetrized (see
appendix c for a proof of this fact). clearly, the osp(2|4)  su(3)  su(2) representa-
tions (6.14) of these elds are the same as in the abelian case, namely those predicted by
the ads/cf t correspondence.

23

it should be noted that in the 4dimensional analogue of these theories, namely in the
t 1,1 case [4, 7], the restriction of the primary conformal elds to the geometrical chiral
ring occurs through the derivatives of the quartic superpotential. as we already noted,
in the d = 3 theories there is no superpotential of dimension 2 which can be introduced
and, accordingly, the embedding equations dening the vanishing ideal cannot be given
as derivatives of a single holomorphic function. it follows that there is some other non
perturbative and so far unclaried mechanism that suppresses the chiral superelds not
belonging to the highest weight representations.

let us know consider the case of the q1,1,1 theory. here, as already pointed out, the
complete kaluza klein spectrum is still under construction [38]. yet the information
available in the literature is sucient to make a comparison between the kaluza klein
predictions and the gauge theory at the level of the chiral multiplets (and also of the
graviton multiplets as we show below). looking at table 7 of [35], we learn that, in a
generic ads4  m 7 compactication, each hypermultiplet contains a scalar state s of
energy label e0 = |y0|, which is actually the cliord vacuum of the representation and
corresponds to the world volume eld s of eq.(6.9). from the general bosonic mass
formulae of [32, 31], we know that s is related to traceless deformations of the internal
metric and its mass is determined by the spectrum of the scalar laplacian on m 7. in the
notations of [31], we normalize the scalar harmonics as

and we have the massformula (see [31] or eq.(b.3) of [35])

(0)3 y = h0 y

(6.17)

(6.18)

(6.19)

which, combined with the general ads4 relation between scalar masses and energy labels
16(e0  2)(e0  1) = m2, yields the formula

m2

s = h0 + 176  24ph0 + 36
4q180 + h0  24p36 + h0

2 + 1

e0 = 3

for the conformal weight of candidate hypermultiplets in terms of the scalar laplacian
eigenvalues. these are already known for q1,1,1 since they were calculated by pope in
[37]. in our normalizations, popes result reads as follows:

h0 = 32(cid:0)j1(j1 + 1) + j2(j2 + 1) + j3(j3 + 1)  1

4y2(cid:1) ,

where (j1, j2, j3) denotes the su(2)3 avor representation and y the rsymmetry u(1)
charge. from our knowledge of the geometrical chiral ring of q1,1,1 (see section 7.2.1) and
from our calculation of the conformal weights of the supersingletons, on the gauge theory
side we expect the following chiral operators:

(6.20)

i1j11,... ikjkk = tr (ai1bj1c1 . . . aikbjkck)
in the following osp(2|4)  su(2)  su(2)  su(2) representation:

osp(2|4)
su(2)  su(2)  su(2)

: hypermultiplet with(cid:26) e0 = k

y0 = k

: j1 = j2 = j3 = 1

2 k

k  1.
24

(6.21)

(6.22)

(6.23)

inserting the representation (6.24) into eq. (6.20) we obtain h0 = 16k2 + 48k and, using
this value in eq. (6.19), we retrieve the conformal eld theory prediction e0 = k. this
shows that the hypermultiplet spectrum found in kaluza klein harmonic expansions on
q1,1,1 agrees with the chiral superelds predicted by the conformal gauge theory.

6.2 conserved currents of the world volume gauge theory
the supergravity massspectrum on ads4m 7, where m 7 is sasakian, contains a number
of ultrashort or massless osp(2|n) multiplets that correspond to the unbroken local gauge
symmetries of the vacuum. these are:

1. the massless n = 2 graviton multiplet(cid:0)2, 2( 3

2), 1(cid:1)

2. the massless n = 2 vector multiplets of the avor group gavor
3. the massless n = 2 vector multiplets associated with the nontrivial harmonic

2forms of m 7 (the betti multiplets).

each of these massless multiplets must have a suitable gauge theory interpretation. in-
deed, also on the gauge theory side, the ultrashort multiplets are associated with the
symmetries of the theory (global in this case) and are given by the corresponding con-
served noether currents.

we begin with the stressenergy supereld t which has a pair of symmetric so(1, 2)

spinor indices and satises the conservation equation

d+
 t  = d t  = 0.

(6.24)

in components, the expansion of this supereld yields the stress energy tensor t(x),
the n = 2 supercurrents ja
 (x).
obviously t  is a singlet with respect to the avor group gavor and it has

 (x) (a = 1, 2) and the u(1) rsymmetry current j r

e0 = 2, y0 = 0, s0 = 1.

(6.25)

this corresponds to the massless graviton multiplet of the bulk and explains the rst
entry in the above enumeration.

to each generator of the avor symmetry group there corresponds, via noether theo-
rem, a conserved vector supercurrent. this is a scalar supereld j i(x, ) transforming in
the adjoint representation of gavor and satisfying the conservation equations

d+d+

 j i = dd j i = 0.

(6.26)

these superelds have

(6.27)
and correspond to the n = 2 massless vector multiplets of gavor that propagate in the
bulk. this explains the second item of the above enumeration.

e0 = 1, y0 = 0, s0 = 0

25

in the specic theories under consideration, we can easily construct the avor currents

these currents satisfy eq.(6.26) and are in the right representations of su(3)  su(2).
their hypercharge is y0 = 0. the conformal weight is not the one obtained by a naive sum,
being the theory interacting. as shown in [36], the conserved currents satisfy e0 = |y0|+1,
hence e0 = 1.
let us nally identify the gauge theory superelds associated with the betti multiplets.
as we stressed in the introduction, the non abelian gauge theory has su(n)p rather than
u(n)p as gauge group. the abelian gauge symmetries that were used to obtain the toric
description of the manifold m 1,1,1 and q1,1,1 in the onebrane case n = 1 are not promoted
to gauge symmetries in the many brane regime n  . yet, they survive as exact global
symmetries of the gauge theory. the associated conserved currents provide the superelds
corresponding to the massless betti multiplets found in the kaluza klein spectrum of the
bulk. as the reader can notice, the b2 betti number of each manifold always agrees with
the number of independent u(1) groups needed to give a toric description of the same
manifold. it is therefore fairly easy to identify the betti currents of our gauge theories.
for instance for the m 1,1,1 case the betti current is

jbetti = 2 u |





|  3 v c|
u



v
c|



.

(6.29)

the two betti currents of q1,1,1 are similarly written down from the toric description.
since the betti currents are conserved, according to what shown in [36], they satisfy
e0 = |y0| + 1. since the hypercharge is zero, we have e0 = 1 and the betti currents
provide the gauge theory interpretation of the massless betti multiplets.

6.3 gauge theory interpretation of the short multiplets

using the massless currents reviewed in the previous section and the chiral superelds,
one has all the building blocks necessary to construct the constrained superelds that
correspond to all the short multiplets found in the kaluza klein spectrum.

as originally discussed in [27] and applied to the explicitly worked out spectra in
[35, 36], short osp(2|4) multiplets correspond to the saturation of the unitarity bound
that relates the energy (or conformal dimension) e0 and hypercharge y0 of the cliord
vacuum to the highest spin smax contained in the multiplet. hence short multiplets occur
when:

e0 = |y0| + smax, ( smax = 2 short graviton

smax = 3
2
smax = 1 short vector

short gravitino

.

(6.30)

26

in abstract representation theory condition (6.30) implies that a subset of states of the
hilbert space have zero norm and decouple from the others. hence the representation is
shortened. in supereld language, the expansion of the supereld is shortened by im-
posing a suitable dierential constraint, invariant with respect to poincare supersymmetry
[36]. then eq. (6.30) is the necessary condition for such a constraint to be invariant also
under superconformal transformations. using chiral superelds and conserved currents as
building blocks, we can construct candidate short superelds that satisfy the appropriate
dierential constraint and eq. (6.30). then we can compare their avor representations
with those of the short multiplets obtained in kaluza klein expansions. in the case of the
m 1,1,1 theory, where the kaluza klein spectrum is known, we nd complete agreement
and hence we explicitly verify the ads/cf t correspondence. for the q1,1,1 manifold we
make instead a prediction in the reverse direction: the gauge theory realization predicts
the outcome of harmonic analysis. while we wait for the construction of the complete
spectrum [38], we can partially verify the correspondence using the information available
at the moment, namely the spectrum of the scalar laplacian [37].

6.3.1 superelds corresponding to the short graviton multiplets

the gauge theory interpretation of these multiplets is quite simple. consider the supereld

(x, ) = t(x, ) chiral(x, ),

(6.31)

where t is the stress energy tensor (6.24) and chiral(x, ) is a chiral supereld. by
construction, the supereld (6.31), at least in the abelian case, satises the equation

  = 0
d+

(6.32)

and then, as shown in [36], it corresponds to a short graviton multiplet of the bulk. it is
natural to extend this identication to the non-abelian case.

given the chiral multiplet spectrum (6.14) and the dimension of the stress energy
current (6.14), we immediately get the spectrum of superelds (6.31) for the case m 1,1,1:

k > 0 .

(6.33)

this exactly coincides with the spectrum of short graviton multiplets found in kaluza
klein theory through harmonic analysis [35].

for the q1,1,1 case the same analysis gives the following prediction for the short gravi-

ton multiplets:

m1 = 3k
m2 = 0
j = k
e0 = 2k + 2, y0 = 2k


(cid:26) j1 = j2 = j3 = 1

e0 = k + 2, y0 = k

2k

k > 0 .

(6.34)

we can make a consistency check on this prediction just relying on the spectrum of the
laplacian (6.20). indeed, looking at table 4 of [35], we see that in a short graviton multiplet
the mass of the spin two particle is

m2

h = 16y0(y0 + 3).

(6.35)

27

looking instead at eq. (b.3) of the same paper, we see that such a mass is equal to the
eigenvalue of the scalar laplacian m2
h = h0. therefore, for consistency of the prediction
(6.34), we should have h0 = 16k(k + 3) for the representation j1 = j2 = j3 = k/2; y = k.
this is indeed the value provided by eq. (6.20).

it should be noted that when we write the operator (6.31), it is understood that all

color indices are symmetrized before taking the contraction.

6.3.2 superelds corresponding to the short vector multiplets

consider next the superelds of the following type:

(x, ) = j(x, ) chiral(x, ),

(6.36)

where j is a conserved vector current of the type analyzed in eq. (6.28) and chiral is
a chiral supereld. by construction, the supereld (6.36), at least in the abelian case,
satises the constraint

d+d+

  = 0

(6.37)

(6.38)

and then, according to the analysis of [36], it can describe a short vector multiplet prop-
agating into the bulk.

in principle, the avor irreducible representations occurring in the supereld (6.36)

are those originating from the tensor product decomposition
r,

ad  rk = rmax  x<max

where ad is the adjoint representation, k is the avor weight of the chiral eld at level k,
max is the highest weight occurring in the product ad  rk and  < max are the lower
weights occurring in the same decomposition.
let us assume that the quantum mechanism that suppresses all the candidate chiral
superelds of subleading weight does the same suppression also on the short vector su-
perelds (6.36). then in the sum appearing on the l.h.s of eq. (6.38) we keep only the
rst term and, as we show in a moment, we reproduce the kaluza klein spectrum of short
vector multiplets. as we see, there is just a universal rule that presides at the selection
of the avor representations in all sectors of the spectrum.
it is the restriction to the
maximal weight. this is the group theoretical implementation of the ideal that denes
the conifold as an algebraic locus in cp. we already pointed out that, dierently from
the d = 4 analogue of these conformal gauge theories, the ideal cannot be implemented
through a superpotential. an equivalent way of imposing the result is to assume that the
color indices have to be completely symmetrized: such a symmetrization automatically
selects the highest weight avor representations.

let us now explicitly verify the matching with kaluza klein spectra. we begin with
the m 1,1,1 case. here the highest weight representations occurring in the tensor product
of the adjoint (m1 = m2 = 1, j = 0)  (m1 = m2 = 0, j = 1) with the chiral spectrum
(6.14) are m1 = 3k + 1, m2 = 1, j = k and m1 = k, m2 = 0, j = k + 1. hence the
spectrum of vector elds (6.36) limited to highest weights is given by the following list of
osp(2|4)  su(2)  su(3) irreps:



m1 = 3k + 1
m2 = 1
j = k
e0 = 2k + 1, y0 = 2k k short vector multiplet

28

k > 0

(6.39)

m1 = 3k
m2 = 0
j = k + 1
e0 = 2k + 1, y0 = 2k k short vector multiplet



k > 0 .

(6.40)

this is precisely the result found in [35].

for the q1,1,1 case our gauge theory realization predicts the following short vector

and

multiplets:

j1 = 1
2k + 1
j2 = 1
2k
j3 = 1
2k
e0 = k + 1, y0 = k

k > 0

(6.41)



and all the other are obtained from (6.41) by permuting the role of the three su(2)
groups. looking at table 6 of [35], we see that in every n = 2 short multiplet emerging
from mtheory compactication on ads4  m 7 the lowest energy state is a scalar s with
squared mass
(6.42)

m2
s = 16y0(y0  1).

hence, recalling eq. (6.18) and combining it with (6.42), we see that for consistency of
our predictions we must have

h0 + 176  24ph0 + 36 = 16k(k  1)

(6.43)

for the representations (6.41). the quadratic equation (6.43) implies h0 = 16k2 +80k +64
which is precisely the result obtained by inserting the values (6.34) into popes formula
(6.20) for the laplacian eigenvalues. hence, also the short vector multiplets follow a
general pattern identical in all sasakian compactications.

we can nally wonder why there are no short vector multiplets obtained by multiplying
the betti currents with chiral superelds. the answer might be the following. from the
avor view point these would not be highest weight representations occurring in the tensor
product of the constituent supersingletons. hence they are suppressed from the spectrum.

6.3.3 superelds corresponding to the short gravitino multiplets

the spectrum of m 1,1,1 derived in [35] contains various series of short gravitino multi-
plets. we can provide their gauge theory interpretation through the following superelds.
consider:

=(cid:0)u u(cid:0)dv v(cid:1)  v v (cid:0)du u(cid:1)(cid:1)i a

where all the color indices are symmetrized before being contracted. by construction the
superelds (6.44,6.45), at least in the abelian case, satisfy the equation

  = 0
d+

(6.46)

and then, as explained in [36], they correspond to short gravitino multiplets propagating
in the bulk. we can immediately check that their highest weight avor representations
yield the spectrum of osp(2|4)su(2)su(3) short gravitino multiplets found by means
of harmonic analysis in [35]. indeed for (6.44),(6.45) we respectively have:

and

m1 = 3k + 1
m2 = 1
j = k + 1
e0 = 2k + 3

2, y0 = 2k

m1 = 3k + 3
m2 = 0
j = k
e0 = 2k + 3

2, y0 = 2k

k  0 ,

k  0 .

(6.47)

(6.48)




we postpone the analysis of short gravitino multiplets on q1,1,1 to [38] since this requires
a more extended knowledge of the spectrum.

6.4 long multiplets with rational protected dimensions

let us now observe that, in complete analogy to what happens for the t 1,1 conformal
spectrum one dimension above [5, 7], also in the case of m 1,1,1 there is a large class of
long multiplets with rational conformal dimensions. actually this seems to be a general
phenomenon in all kaluza klein compactications on homogeneous spaces g/h. indeed,
although the q1,1,1 spectrum is not yet completed [38], we can already see from its lapla-
cian spectrum (6.20) that a similar phenomenon occurs also there. more precisely, while
the short multiplets saturate the unitarity bound and have a conformal weight related
to the hypercharge and maximal spin by eq. (6.30), the rational long multiplets satisfy a
quantization condition of the conformal dimension of the following form

inspecting the m 1,1,1 spectrum determined in [35], we nd the following long rational

e0 = |y0| + smax + ,

(6.63)

the generalized presence of these rational long multiplets hints at various still unexplored
quantum mechanisms that, in the conformal eld theory, protect certain operators from
acquiring anomalous dimensions. at least for the long graviton multiplets, characterized
by  = 1, the corresponding protected superelds are easy to guess.
if we take the

31

supereld of a short vector multiplet j(x, ) chiral(x, ) and we multiply it by a stress
energy supereld t(x, ), namely if we consider a supereld of the form

  conserved vector current  stress energy tensor  chiral operator,

(6.64)

we reproduce the right osp(2|4)  su(3)  su(2) representations of the long rational
graviton multiplets of m 1,1,1. the soundness of such an interpretation can be checked by
looking at the graviton multiplet spectrum on q1,1,1. this is already available since it is
once again determined by the laplacian spectrum. applying formula eq. (6.64) to the
q1,1,1 gauge theory leads to predict the following spectrum of long rational multiplets:

j1 = 1
2k + 1
j2 = 1
2k
j3 = 1
2k
e0 = k + 1, y0 = k

k > 0

(6.65)



and all the other are obtained from (6.65) by permuting the role of the three su(2) groups.
looking at table 1 of [35], we see that in a graviton multiplet the spin two particle has
mass

which for the candidate multiplets (6.66) yields

m2
h = 16(e0 + 1)(e0  2),

m2

h = 16(k + 4)(k + 1).

(6.66)

(6.67)

on the other hand, looking at eq.
graviton is just the eigenvalue of the scalar laplacian m2
(6.20) to the representations of (6.65) we indeed nd

(b.3) of [35] we see that the squared mass of the
h = h0. applying popes formula

h0 = 16k2 + 80k + 64 = 16(k + 4)(k + 1).

(6.68)

it appears, therefore, that the generation of rational long multiplets is based on the
universal mechanism codied by the ansatz (6.64) applicable to all compactications.
why these superelds have protected conformal dimensions is still to be claried within
the framework of the superconformal gauge theory. the superelds leading to rational
long multiplets with much higher values of , like the cases  = 3 and  = 9 that we have
found, are more dicult to guess. yet their appearance seems to be a general phenomenon
and this, as we have already stressed, hints at general protection mechanisms that have
still to be investigated.

part iii
detailed geometrical analysis

in the third part of this paper we give a more careful discussion of the geometry of the
homogeneous sasakian manifolds on which we compactify mtheory in order to obtain
the conformal gauge theories we have been discussing. in the general classication [34] of
seven dimensional coset manifolds that can be used as internal manifolds for freund rubin

32

solutions ads4  m 7, all the supersymmetric cases have been determined and found to
be in nite number. there is one n = 8 case corresponding to the seven sphere s7, three
n = 1 cases and three n = 2 cases. the reason why these g/h manifolds admit n = 2
is that they are sasakian, namely the metric cone constructed over them is a calabi
yau conifold. we give a unied geometric description of these manifolds emphasizing all
the features of their algebraic, topological and dierential structure which are relevant
in deriving the properties of the associated superconformal eld theories. the cases, less
relevant for the present paper, of n 0,1,0, v5,2 and s7 are discussed in appendix b.

7 algebraic geometry, topology and metric structure

of the homogeneous sasakian 7-manifolds

we want to describe all the sasakian 7-manifolds entering the game as brations  : m 7 =

ma is a compact real 6-dimensional manifold.

g/h  g/eh = ma with bre eh/h = u(1), where g is a semisimple compact lie group
and eh  g is a compact subgroup containing a maximal torus t of g. as such, the base
since eh/h  u(1), h is the kernel of the non-trivial homomorphism  : eh  u(1)
given by the natural projection. the bundle g  u(1)  g/eh associated to this
character is the space of orbits of eh acting on g  u(1) as (g, u)eh = (geh, (eh)1u).

since the character is non-trivial, the total space of this bundle is homogeneous for g
and the stabilizer of the base point is precisely the kernel of . accordingly, we have an
isomorphism

(7.1)

g/h  g  u(1)  g/eh.

the rationale for this description is that there is a holomorphic version; one rst
complexies g to gc in the standard way, next one chooses an orientation of the roots of
liegc in such a way that the character  is the exponential of an antidominant weight

complex structure of gc/p we get a compact complex 3-fold.

and nally one completes the complexication ehc by exponentiating the missing positive
roots. this gives a parabolic subgroup p  gc and gc/p  g/eh. giving to ma the
the character of eh determined above extends to a (holomorphic) character of the

parabolic subgroup p and this induces a holomorphic line bundle l over ma, which is
homogeneous for gc and has plenty holomorphic sections spanning the irrep with highest
weight  log(). restricting to the compact form g, l acquires a bre metric and m 7 is
simply the unit circle bundle inside l. it turns out that l produces a kodaira embedding
of ma in p(v ), the linear space v = h 0(ma, l) being precisely the space of holomorphic
sections of l.

embedding quadrics and representation theory

one can also write down the equations for the image of ma in p(v ) by means of
representation theory. being ma a homogeneous variety, it is cut out by homogeneous
equations of degree at most two. to nd them one proceeds as follows. the space of
quadrics in p(v ) is the symmetric tensor product sym2(v ). as a representation of gc
this is actually reducible (for a generic dominant character 1) and decomposes as

sym2(v ) = w2  w,

33

(7.2)

w being the irrep induced by the character  of p . it turns out that the weight vectors
spanning the addenda w,  6= 2, considered as quadratic relations among the homo-
geneous coordinates of p(v ), generate the ideal i of ma. generically the image of the
embedding is not a complete intersection.

coordinate ring versus chiral ring

finally, the homogeneous coordinate ring of ma  p(v ) is

c[w1]/i  k0wk.

(7.3)

the physical interpretation of this coordinate ring in the context of 3d conformal eld
theories emerging from an m2 brane compactication on a sasakian m 7
s is completely
analogous to the interpretation of the coordinate ring in the context of 2d conformal
eld theories emerging from string compactication on an algebraic calabi yau threefold
m 6
cy . in the second case let x be the projective coordinates of ambient p4 space and
w (x) = 0 the algebraic equation cutting out the calabiyau locus. then the ring

c[x]

wcy (x)

(7.4)

is isomorphic to the ring of primary conformal chiral operators of the (2, 2) cft with
c = 9 realized on the world sheet. these latter are characterized by being invariant under
one of the two worldsheet supercurrents (say g(z)) and by having their conformal
weight h = |y|/2 xed in terms of their u(1) charge. geometrically, this is also the ring of
hodge structure deformations. in a completely analogous way the coordinate ring (7.3) is
isomorphic to the ring of conformal hypermultiplets of the n = 2, d = 3 superconformal
theory. the hypermultiplets are short representations [35, 36] of the conformal group
osp(2|4) and are characterized by e0 = |y0|, where e0 is the conformal weight while y0
is the rsymmetry charge.

homology

for applications to brane geometry, it is also important to know the homology (equiv-
alently, cohomology) of m 7. being m 7 a circle bundle, we can use the gysin sequence
in cohomology [58]. since the base ma is acyclic in odd dimensions, the gysin sequence
splits into subsequences of the form

0  h 2k1(m 7, z)  h 2k2(ma, z) c1 h 2k(ma, z)  h 2k(m 7, z)  0,

(7.5)

where the map c1 is the product by the euler class of the bration m 7, which equals the
rst chern class of l.

we now apply these standard results [62, 64, 63, 58] to the various manifolds which

enter our physical problem.

7.1 the manifold m 1,1,1

the rst case is given by

m 1,1,1 = su(3)  su(2)  u(1)/su(2)  u(1)  u(1) = g/h.

(7.6)

34

7.1.1 generalities

let us call hi, i = 1, 2, h and y the generators of the lie algebras of the standard maximal
tori of su(3), su(2) and u(1) respectively, all normalized with periods 2. then su(2)
is embedded in su(3) as the stabilizer of the last basis vector of c3, and the u(1)s are
generated by z = (h1 + 2h2)  h  4y , and z = (h1 + 2h2) + 3h.
to reconstruct the general structure described at the beginning of this section, notice
that the image of h under the projection of g onto su(3) is isomorphic to s(u(2) 
u(1)). this projection gives an exact sequence 0  k  h  h  0 and, since k is
normal in h, we have an isomorphism g/h = (g/k)/(h/k)  g/h. the elements
of h have the form

(cid:18)(cid:18) g 0

0 1 (cid:19) exp(i( + )(h1 + 2h2)), exp(i(3  )h), exp(i4y )(cid:19) ,

(7.7)

where g  su(2) and ,   [0, 2]. so k is given by g = (1)l,  +  = l and its
generic element is (1, exp(4ih), exp(4iy )). taking the quotient by k, the third
factor of g is factored out and there is an extra z2 acting on the maximal torus of su(2).
consequently, we nd that g/k = su(3)  so(3) and the image of h in g/k has a
component on the maximal torus of so(3) (generated by exp 2it) corresponding to the
innitesimal character (h1) = 0, (h2) = 3t.
u(1))  u(1). accordingly

summing up, we have g = su(3)  so(3), h = s(u(2)  u(1)) and eh = s(u(2) 

ma = gr(2, 3)  p1  p2  p1,

(7.8)

pn being the complex ndimensional space and gr(2, 3) being the grassmannian of
2planes in c3. 9
get

now we have to recognize the character. this comes by projecting eh onto eh/h. we

exp(ih1)  eh = eh,
exp(ih2)  eh = exp(3it)h,
exp(it)  eh = exp(it)h,

where t has been identied with the generator of eh/h. the character restricted to

so(3) is the fundamental one, which corresponds to the adjoint representation of su(2)
and therefore is the square of the fundamental character of su(2). we see then that
m 1,1,1 is the circle bundle 10 inside l = o(3)  o(2) over p2  p1.
the fundamental group of the circle bundle associated to the innitesimal character
(h1) = 0, (h2) = m, (h) = n is zgcd(m,n) applying the same analysis to m p,q,r, the
character corresponds to

dual space c3.

for r = 0. notice that m 1,1,1 = m 1,1,r is simply connected. although in [34] it is stated
that m 1,1,1 = m 1,1,0/z4, a closer analysis shows that the z4 action is trivial. in particular
h1(m 1,1,1, z) is torsionless.

7.1.2 the algebraic embedding equations and the chiral ring of m 1,1,1
as for the algebraic embedding of m 1,1,1, since dimw1 = 30, l embeds

ma  p2  p1  p29

(7.9)

by

x ijk|ab = u i u j u k v a v b

(

i, j, k = 0, 2, 3 ; a, b = 1, 2 ) ,

(7.10)

namely by writing the 30 homogeneous coordinates x ijk|ab of p29 as polynomials in the
homogeneous coordinates u i, i = 0, 1, 2 of p2 and v a (a = 0, 1) of p1. the image of ma
is cut out by dimsym2(w1) dimw2 = 465 140 = 325 equations. alternatively the
same 325 equations can be seen as the embedding of the cone c(m 1,1,1) over the sasakian
u(1) bundle into c30.
for further clarication we describe the explicit form of these embedding equations
in the language of young tableaux. from eq. (7.9) it follows that the 30 homogeneous
coordinates of p29 are assigned to the representation (10, 3) of su(3)  su(2):

x ijk|ab 7 (10, 3) 

   .

(7.11)

this means that the quadric monomials x 2 span the following symmetric tensor product:

x 2 = (cid:16) (cid:2)

   (cid:3)  (cid:2)

   (cid:3) (cid:17)sym

(7.12)

in general the number of independent components of x 2 is just

dim x 2 =

30  31

= 465,

(7.13)

which corresponds to the sum of dimensions of all the irreducible representations of
su(3)  su(2) contained in the symmetric product (7.12), but on the locus dened
by the explicit embedding (7.9) only 28  5 = 140 of these components are independent.

else but the statement that all the representations of su(3)  su(2) contained in the
symmetric product (7.12) should vanish with the exception of the representation (7.14).
let us work out the representations that should vanish. to this eect we begin by
writing the complete decomposition into irreducible representations of su(3) of the tensor
product 10  10:

next in eq. (7.15) we separate the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the decompo-
sition, obtaining

as a next step we do the same decomposition for the tensor product 3  3 of su(2)
representations. we have

hence the equations can be arranged into 5 representations corresponding to the list
appearing in the second row of eq. (7.22). indeed, eq. (7.22) is the explicit form, in the
case m 1,1,1, of the general equation (7.2) and the addenda in its second line are what we
named w,  6= 2, in the general discussion.
in the m 1,1,1 case, it takes the following form:

in eq. (7.23) we recognize the spectrum of su(3) su(2) representations of the osp(2|4)
hypermultiplets as determined by harmonic analysis on m 1,1,1.
indeed, recalling the
results of [35, 36], the hypermultiplet of conformal weight (energy label) e0 = 2k and
hypercharge y0 = 2k is in the representation

m1 = 3k ; m2 = 0 ;

j = k.

7.1.3 cohomology of m 1,1,1

let us now compute the cohomology of m 1,1,1. the rst chern class of l is c1 = 21+32,
where 1 (resp. 2) is the generator of the second cohomology group of p1 (resp. p2).
in this case the gysin sequence gives:

h 0(m 1,1,1) = h 7(m 1,1,1) = z,

0  h 1(m 1,1,1)  z

0  h 3(m 1,1,1)  z  z

0  h 5(m 1,1,1)  z  z

c1 z  z  h 2(m 1,1,1)  0,
c1 z  z  h 4(m 1,1,1)  0,
c1 z  h 6(m 1,1,1)  0.

(7.25)
the rst c1 sends 1  h 0(ma) to c1  h 2(ma). its kernel is zero, and its image is z.
accordingly, h 2(m 1,1,1) = z  (1 + 2). the second c1 sends (1, 2)  z  z =
h 2(ma) to (312, 212 + 32
2)  z  z = h 4(ma). its kernel vanishes and therefore
h 3(m 1,1,1) = 0. its cokernel is z9 = h 4(m 1,1,1) generated by (12 + 2
2). finally, the
last c1 sends 12 and 2
2  h 6(ma).
this map is surjective, so h 6(m 1,1,1) = 0 and its kernel is generated by  = 212+32
2.
hence h 5(m 1,1,1) = z  , with  = .
7.1.4 explicit description of the sasakian bration for m 1,1,1

2  h 4(ma) = z z respectively to 312

2 and 212

we proceed next to an explicit description of the bration structure of m 1,1,1 as a u(1)-
bundle over p2  p1. we construct an atlas of local trivializations and we give the appro-
priate transition functions. this is important for our discussion of the supersymmetric
cycles leading to the baryon states.

38

we take   [0, 4) as a local coordinate on the bre and (e,e) as local coordinates

on p1  s2. to describe p2 we have to be a little bit careful. p2 can be covered by the
three patches w  c2 in which one of the three homogeneous coordinates, u, does not
vanish. the set not covered by one of these w is homeomorphic to s2. we choose to
parametrize w3 as in [51]:

where

(cid:26)  1 = u1/u3 = tan  cos(/2) ei(+)/2

 2 = u2/u3 = tan  sin(/2) ei()/2

,

  (0, /2)
  (0, )
0  ( + )  4
0  (  )  4

.



(7.26)

(7.27)

these coordinates cover the whole w3  c2 except for the trivial coordinate singularities
 = 0 and  = 0, . furthermore  and  can be extended to the complement of w3.
indeed, the ratio

z =  1/ 2 = tan1(/2) ei

(7.28)
is well dened in the limit   /2 and it constitutes the usual stereographic map of s2
onto the complex plane (see the next discussion of q1,1,1 and in particular gure 4).
just as for the sphere, we must be careful in treating some one-forms near the coor-
dinate singularities. in particular, d and d are not well dened on the three s2 which
are not covered by one of the patches w: { = /2}, { = 0} and { = /2} (see gure
3.) actually, except for the three points of these spheres that are covered by only one
patch ({ = 0}  w3, { = /2,  = 0}  w1, { = /2,  = }  w2), one particular
combination of d and d survives, as it is illustrated in table (7.29).

the singular one-forms become well dened if we multiply them by a function having a

we come now to the description of the bre bundle m 1,1,1. we cover the base p2  p1
with six open charts u = w  h ( = 1, 2, 3) on which we can dene a local bre
coordinate   [0, 4). the transition functions are given by:

( 1 = 3  3( + ) + 2(  )e ,
1 = 2  6 + 2(  )e .

(,  = 1)

(7.30)

on this principal bre bundle we can easily introduce a u(1) lie algebra valued connection
which, on the various patches of the base space, is described by the following oneforms:



a1 =  3
a2 =  3
a3 =  3

2(cos 2 + 1)(d + d)  3
2(cos 2 + 1)(d  d)  3

figure 3: schematic representation of the atlas on p2. the three patches w cover
the open ball and part of the boundary circle, which constitutes the set of coordinate
singularities. this latter is made of three s2s: { = 0}, { = } and { = /2}, which
touch each other at the three points marked with a dot. each w covers the whole p2
except for one of the spheres (for example, w3 does not cover { = /2}). the three
most singular points are covered by only one patch (for example, { = 0} is covered by
the only w3).

due to (7.30), the one-form (d a) is a global angular form [58]. it can then be taken
as the 7-th vielbein of the following su(3)  su(2)  u(1) invariant metric on m 1,1,1:

(7.32)

the one-form a is the connection of the hodge-kahler bundle on p2  p1.
einstein metric

the einstein metric on the homogeneous space m 1,1,1 was originally constructed by
castellani et al in [24] using the intrinsic geometry of coset manifolds. in such a language,
which is that employed in [35] to develop harmonic analysis and construct the kaluza
klein spectrum we have

(m = 1, . . . , 3) are the leftinvariant 1forms in the adjoint of su(2) and  is the left-
invariant 1form on u(1). the  dependent rescalings appearing in (7.33) were obtained
by imposing that the ricci tensor is proportional to the metric which yields a cubic
equation with just one real root [24]. such a cubic equation was retrieved a little later
also by page and pope [28]. these authors wrote the einstein metric in the coordinate

our discussion of the supersymmetric 5cycles. in this frame eq. (7.33) becomes

where the three addenda of (7.34) are one by one identied with the three addenda of
(7.33). the second and the third addenda are the p2 and s2 metric on the base manifold
of the u(1) bration, while the rst term is the bre metric. in other words, one recognizes
the structure of the metric anticipated in (7.32). the parameter  appearing in the metric
(7.34) is the internal cosmological constant dened by eq. (5.16).

7.1.5 the baryonic 5cycles of m 1,1,1 and their volume

as we saw above, the relevant homology group of m 1,1,1 for the calculation of the baryonic
masses is

h5(m 1,1,1, r) = r .

(7.35)

let us consider the following two ve-cycles, belonging to the same homology class:

c1 :( e =e0 = const
e = e0 = const
c2 :(cid:26)  = 0 = const

 = 0 = const

,

.

(7.36)

(7.37)

the two representatives (7.36, 7.37) are distinguished by their dierent stability subgroups
which we calculate in the next subsection.

volume of the 5cycles

the volume of the cycles (7.36, 7.37) is easily computed by pulling back the metric
(7.34) on c1 and c2, that have the topology of a u(1)-bundle over p2 and p1  p1
respectively:

93

vol(c1) =ic 1
vol(c2) =ic 2

the volume of m 1,1,1 is instead given by

41

the results (7.38, 7.39, 7.40) can be inserted into the general formula (5.28) to calculate
the conformal weights (or energy labels) of ve-branes wrapped on the cycles c1 and c2.
we obtain:

.

(7.41)

as stated above, the result (7.41) is essential in proving that the conformal weight of the
elementary worldvolume elds v a, u i are

e0(c1) = n/3
e0(c2) = 4n/9


h(cid:2)v 4(cid:3) = 1/3 ,

h(cid:2)u i(cid:3) = 4/9

(7.42)

(7.44)

(7.45)

respectively. to reach such a conclusion we need to identify the states obtained by wrap-
ping the vebrane on c1,c2 with operators in the avor representations m1 = 0, m2 =
0, j = n/2 and m1 = n, m2, j = 0, respectively. this conclusion, as anticipated in the
introductory sections is reached by studying the stability subgroups of the supersymmet-
ric 5cycles.

7.1.6 stability subgroups of the baryonic 5-cycles of m 1,1,1 and the avor

representations of the baryons

let us now consider the stability subgroups

h(ci)  g = su(3)  su(2)  u(1)

(7.43)

of the two cycles (7.36, 7.37). let us begin with the rst cycle dened by (7.36). as we
have previously said, this is the restriction of the u(1)-bration to p2  {p}, p being a
point of p1. hence, the stability subgroup of the cycle c1 is:

h(cid:0)c1(cid:1) = su(3)  u(1)r  u(1)b,1

where u(1)r is the rsymmetry u(1) appearing as a factor in su(3)  su(2)  u(1)r
while u(1)b,1  su(2) is a maximal torus.
turning to the case of the second cycle (7.37), which is the restriction of the u(1)-
bundle to the product of a hyperplane of p2 and p1, its stabilizer is

h(cid:0)c2(cid:1) = s(u(1)b,2  u(2))  su(2)  u(1)r,

where su(2)  u(1)r is the group appearing as a factor in su(3)  su(2)  u(1)r,
u(1)b,2  su(3) is the subgroup generated by h1 = diag(1,1, 0) and s(u(1)b,2 
u(2))  su(3) is the stabilizer of the rst basis vector of c3.
following the procedure introduced by witten in [39] we should now quantize the
collective coordinates of the nonperturbative baryon state obtained by wrapping the ve
brane on the 5cycles we have been discussing. as explained in wittens paper this leads
to quantum mechanics on the homogeneous manifold g/h(c). in our case the collective
coordinates of the baryon live on the following spaces:

space of collective coordinates

h(c)

42

su (2)

u (1)b,1  p1

su (3)

s(u (1)b,2u (2))  p2

for c1
for c2

. (7.46)

the wave function  (collec. coord.) is in wittens phrasing a section of a line bundle of
degree n. this happens because the baryon has baryon number n, namely it has charge
n under the additional massless vector multiplet that is associated with a harmonic 2
form and appears in the kaluza klein spectrum since dimh2(m 1,1,1) = 1 6= 0. these are
the betti multiplets mentioned in section 4.3. following wittens reasoning there is a
morphism

i : u(1)baryon  h(ci)

i = 1, 2

(7.47)

of the non perturbative baryon number group into the stability subgroup of the 5cycle.
clearly the image of such a morphism must be a u(1)factor in h(c) that has a non
trivial action on the collective coordinates of the baryons. clearly in the case of our two
baryons we have:

im i = u(1)b,i

i = 1, 2 .

(7.48)

the name given to these groups anticipated the conclusions of such an argument.

translated into the language of harmonic analysis, wittens statement that the baryon
wave function should be a section of a line bundle with degree n means that we are sup-
posed to consider harmonics on g/h(c) which, rather than being scalars of h(c), are
in the 1dimensional representation of u(1)b with charge n. according to the general
rules of harmonic analysis (see [25, 31, 35]) we are supposed to collect all the representa-
tions of g whose reduction with respect to h(c) contains the prescribed representation
of h(c). in the case of the rst cycle, in view of eq. (7.44) we want all representations
of su(2) that contain the state 2j3 = n. indeed the generator of u(1)b,1 can always be
regarded as the third component of angular momentum by means of a change of basis.
the representations with this property are those characterized by:

2j = n + 2k,

k  0.

since the laplacian on g/h(c) has eigenvalues proportional to the casimir

su (2)/u (1) = const  j(j + 1),

(7.49)

(7.50)

the harmonic satisfying the constraint (7.49) and with minimal energy is just that with

2j = n.

(7.51)

this shows that under the avor group the baryon associated with the rst cycle is
neutral with respect to su(3) and transforms in the ntimes symmetric representation
of su(2). this perfectly matches, on the superconformal eld theory side, with our
candidate operator (5.3).

equivalently the choice of the representation 2j = n corresponds with the identi-
cation of the baryon wavefunction with a holomorphic section (=zero mode) of the
u(1)bundle under consideration, i.e. with a section of the corresponding line bundle.
indeed such a line bundle is, by denition, constructed over p1 and declared to be of
degree n, hence it is op1(n). representation-wise a section of op1(n) is just an element
of the j = n/2 representation, namely it is the n times symmetric of su(2).
let us now consider the case of the second cycle. here the same reasoning instructs us
to consider all representations of su(3) which, reduced with respect to u(1)b,2, contain
a state of charge n. moreover, directly aiming at zero mode, we can assign the baryon
wavefunction to a holomorphic sections of a line bundle on p2, which must correspond

43

to characters of the parabolic subgroup s(u(1)b,2  u(2)). as before the degree n of
this line bundle uniquely characterizes it as o(n). in the language of young tableaux,
the corresponding su(3) representation is

m1 = 0 ; m2 = n,

(7.52)

i.e. the representation of this baryon state is the ntime symmetric of the dual of su(3)
and this perfectly matches with the complex conjugate of the candidate conformal oper-
ator 5.2. in other words we have constructed the antichiral baryon state. the chiral one
obviously has the same conformal dimension.

7.1.7 these 5cycles are supersymmetric

the 5cycles we have been considering in the above subsections have to be supersymmetric
in order for the conclusions we have been drawing to be correct. indeed all our arguments
have been based on the assumption that the 5brane wrapped on such cycles is a bp s
state. this is true if the 5brane action localized on the cycle is supersymmetric.

the -symmetry projection operator for a ve-brane is

p =

1

2(cid:18)  i

1
5!g

x m x n x p x qx r m n p qr(cid:19) ,

(7.53)

where the functions x m () dene the embedding of the ve-brane into the eleven di-
mensional spacetime, and g is the square root of the determinant of the induced metric
on the brane. the gamma matrices m n p qr, dening the spacetime spinorial structure,
are the pullback through the vielbeins of the constant gamma matrices abcde satisfying
the standard cliord algebra:

(7.54)
a possible choice of vielbeins for c(m 1,1,1)  m3, namely the product of the metric cone
over m 1,1,1 times three dimensional minkowski space is the following one:

rabcde .

e8 = dr

e0 = dt

.

(7.55)



in these coordinates the embedding equations of the two cycles (7.36), (7.37) are very
simple, so we have

1
5!

x m x n x p x qx r m n p qr =(cid:26)

,

(7.56)

for c1 and c2 respectively. by means of the vielbeins (7.55) these gamma matrices are
immediately computed:

while the square root of the determinant of the metric on the two cycles is easily seen to
be

r5 sin3  cos  sin  34567

(   =(cid:0) 3
32(cid:1)2
512 r5 sin  cos  sine 31245

512 r5 sin  cos  sine

g1 = 3

.

,

(7.57)

(7.58)

so, for both cycles, the -symmetry projector (7.53) reduces to the projector of a ve
dimensional hyperplane embedded in at spacetime:

p =(cid:26) 1

1

2 (  i 34567)
2 (  i 31245)

.

(7.59)

the important thing to check is that the projectors (7.59) are nonzero on the two killing
spinors of the space c(m 1,1,1) m3. indeed, this latter has not 32 preserved supersymme-
tries, rather it has only 8 of them. in order to avoid long and useless calculations we just
argue as follows. using the gammamatrix basis of [24], the killing spinors are already
known. we have:

0 = 0  188
9 = 2  188
i = 5  i

;
;

(i = 1, . . . , 7)

8 = 1  188
10 = 3  188

(7.60)

where 0,1,2,3 are the usual 4 4 gamma matrices in fourdimensional spacetime, while i
are the 88 gammamatrices satisfying the so(7) cliord algebra in the form: {i , j} =
ij. for these matrices we take the representation given in the appendix of [24], which
is well adapted to the intrinsic description of the m 1,1,1 metric through maurercartan
forms as in eq. (7.33). in this basis the killing spinors were calculated in [24] and have
the following form:

;

0
u

u

 =
1 0 (cid:19) u =(cid:18)

a + ib (cid:19)

(7.62)

killing spinors = (x)  

where

u = (cid:18) a + ib

0

(cid:19) ;

u =(cid:18) 0

and where the 8component spinor was written in 2component blocks.

45

in the same basis, using notations of [24], we have:

34567 = 5  u8 u4 u5 u6 u7  3 = i 5  
= i 5

(7.63)
as we see, by comparing eq. (7.59) with eq. (7.61) and (7.63), the supersymmetry
projector reduces for both cycles to a chirality projector on the 4component spacetime
part (x). as such, the supersymmetry projector always admits non vanishing eigen-
states implying that the cycle is supersymmetric. the only aw in the above argument is
that the killing spinor (7.61) was determined in [24] using as vielbein basis the suitably
rescaled maurercartan forms 3, m, (m = 1, 2) and a, (a = 4, 5, 6, 7). our choice
(7.55) does not correspond to the same vielbein basis. however, a little inspection shows
that it diers only by some so(4) rotation in the space of p2 vielbein 4, 5, 6, 7. hence we
can turn matters around and ask what happens to the killing spinor (7.61) if we apply
an so(4) rotation in the directions 4, 5, 6, 7. it suces to check the form of the gamma
matrices [a , b] which are the generators of such rotations. using again the appendix
of [24] we see that such so(4) generators are of the form

i

so that the so(4) rotated killing spinor is of the same form as in eq.(7.61) with, however,
u replaced by u = au where a  su(2). it is obvious that such an su(2) transformation
does not alter our conclusions. we can always decompose u into 3 eigenstates and asso-
ciate the 3eigenvalue with the chirality eigenvalue, so as to satisfy the supersymmetry
projection. hence, our 5cycles are indeed supersymmetric.

7.2 the manifold q1,1,1
this is dened by g = su(2)  su(2)  su(2), h = u(1)  u(1).
if we call hi the
generators of the maximal tori of the su(2)s, normalized with periods 2, h is generated

u(1) is the product of the three maximal tori. so the base is

by h1 h2 and h1 h3, i.e. the complement of z = h1 + h2 + h3, while eh = u(1) u(1)
ma = p1  p1  p1.
the generator of eh/h can be taken to be h1. now

(7.68)

by the same argument as in the m 1,1,1 case, we nd that the image is cut out by 3627 = 9
equations. indeed, eq. (7.68) states that the p7 homogeneous coordinates are assigned to
the following irrep of su(2)  su(2)  su(2):

7.2.2 cohomology of q1,1,1

as for the cohomology, the rst chern class of l is c1 = 1 + 2 + 3, where i are the
generators of the second cohomology group of the p1s. reasoning as for m 1,1,1, one gets

h 1(q1,1,1, z) = h 3(q1,1,1, z) = h 6(q1,1,1, z) = 0,

h 2(q1,1,1, z) = z  1  z  2,

h 4(q1,1,1, z) = z2  (12 + 13 + 23),

h 5(q1,1,1, z) = z    z  ,

(7.75)

where  = 12  13,  = 12  23 and the pullbacks are left implicit.
7.2.3 explicit description of the sasakian bration for q1,1,1
the coset space q1,1,1 is a u(1)-bre bundle over p1  p1  p1  s2  s2  s2. we can
parametrize the base manifold with polar coordinates (i, i), i = 1, 2, 3. we cover the
base with eight coordinate patches, h (, ,  = 1) and choose local coordinates for
the bre,   [0, 4). every patch is the product of three open sets, h i
, each one
describing a coordinate patch for a single two-sphere, as indicated in g. 4:

h = h 1

  h 2

  h 3
 .

(7.76)

to describe the total space we have to specify the transition maps for  on the intersec-

figure 4: two coordinate patches for the sphere. they constitute the base for a local
trivialization of a bre bundle on s2. each patch covers only one of the poles, where the
coordinates (, ) are singular.

tions of the patches. these maps for the generic qp,q,r space are

111 = 222 + p(1  2)1 + q(1  2)2 + r(1  2)3 .

(7.77)

for example, in the case of interest, q1,1,1, we have

++ = ++  22 + 23 .

(7.78)

we note that these maps are well dened, being all the s and s dened modulo 4
and 2 respectively.

48

it is important to note that  and  are clearly not good coordinates for the whole s2.
the most important consequence of this fact is that the one-form d is not extensible to
the poles. to extend it to one of the poles, d has to be multiplied by a function which
has a double zero on that pole, such as sin2 

we can dene a u(1)-connection a on the base s2  s2  s2 by specifying it on each

2 d.

patch h

11:

a = (  cos 1)d1 + (  cos 2)d2 + (  cos 3)d3 .

(7.79)

because of the bre-coordinate transition maps (7.77), the one-form (d  a) is globally
well dened on q1,1,1. in other words the dierent one-forms (d  a) dened on
the corresponding h, coincide on the intersections of the patches. we can therefore
dene an su(2)3  u(1)-invariant metric on the total space by:
s 2s 2s 2 .

q1,1,1 = c2(d  a)2 + a2ds2

where  is the compact space cosmological constant dened in eq.(5.16). the einstein
metric (7.81) was originally found by dauria, fre and van nieuwenhuizen [29], who intro-
duced the family qp,q,r of d=11 compactications and found that n = 2 supersymmetry
is preserved in the case p = q = r. all the other cosets in the family break supersymmetry
to n = 0, namely, in mathematical language, are not sasakian. in [29] the einstein metric
was constructed using the intrinsic geometry of coset manifolds and using maurercartan
forms. an explicit form was also given using stereographic coordinates on the three s2.
in the coordinate form of eq. (7.81) the einstein metric of q1,1,1 was later written by
page and pope [30].

7.2.4 the baryonic 5cycles of q1,1,1 and their volume

the relevant homology group of q1,1,1 for the calculation of the baryonic masses is

h5(q1,1,1, r) = r2 .

(7.82)

three (dependent) ve-cycles spanning h5(q1,1,1) are the restrictions of the u(1)-bration
to the product of two of the three p1s. using the above metric (7.81) one easily computes
the volume of these cycles. for instance

vol(cycle) =i1(p1

8(cid:19)5/2

4 sin 1 sin 2 d1 d2 d1 d2 d =

4 (cid:18) 6
(cid:19)5/2

. (7.83)

the volume of the whole space q1,1,1 is

vol(q1,1,1) =iq1,1,1(cid:18) 3

8(cid:19)7/2

8

sin i didi d =

4

8 (cid:18) 6
(cid:19)7/2

.

(7.84)

11it is worth noting that the connection a is chosen to be well dened on the coordinate singularities

of each patch, i.e. on the product of the three s 2 poles covered by the patch.

3yi=1

49

just as in the m 1,1,1 case, inserting the above results (7.83, 7.84) into the general formula
(5.28) we obtain the conformal weight of the baryon operator corresponding to the ve-
brane wrapped on this cycle:

e0 =

.

(7.85)

n
3

the other two cycles can be obtained from this by permuting the role of the three
p1s and their volume is the same. this fact agrees with the symmetry which exchanges
the fundamental elds a, b and c of the conformal theory, or the three gauge groups
su(n). indeed, naming su(2)i (i = 1, 2, 3) the three su(2) factors appearing in the
isometry group of q1,1,1, the stability subgroup of the rst of the cycles described above
is

h(c1) = su(2)1  su(2)2  u(1)b,3
u(1)b,3  su(2)3

(7.86)

so that the collective coordinates of the baryon state live on p1  su(2)3/u(1)b,3. this
result is obtained by an argument completely analogous to that used in the analysis of
m 1,1,1 5cycles and leads to a completely analogous conclusion. the baryon state is in
the j1 = 0, j2 = 0, j3 = n/2 avor representation. in the conformal eld theory the
corresponding baryon operator is the chiral eld (5.6) and the result (7.85) implies that
the conformal weight of the ci elementary worldvolume eld is

h[ci] =

1
3

.

(7.87)

the stability subgroup of the permuted cycles is obtained permuting the indices 1, 2, 3 in
eq. (7.86) and we reach the obvious conclusion

h[ai] = h[bj] = h[c] =

1
3

.

(7.88)

this matches with the previous result (7.74) on the spectrum of chiral operators, which
are predicted of the form

chiral operators = tr (ai1 bj1 c1 . . . aik bjk ck)

(7.89)

and should have conformal weight e = k. indeed, we have k  ( 1

3 + 1

3 + 1

3) = k !

8 conclusions

we saw, using geometrical intuition, that there is a set of supersingletons elds which are
likely to be the fundamental degrees of freedom of the cfts corresponding to q1,1,1 and
m 1,1,1. the entire kk spectrum and the existence of baryons of given quantum numbers
can be explained in terms of these singletons.

we also proposed candidate three-dimensional gauge theories which should ow in the
ir to the superconformal xed points dual to the ads4 compactications. the singletons
are the elementary chiral multiplets of these gauge theories. the main problem we did
not solve is the existence of chiral operators in the gauge theory that have no counterpart
in the kk spectrum. these are the non completely avor symmetric chiral operators.

50

their existence is due to the fact that, dierently from the case of t 1,1, we are not able to
write any superpotential of dimension two. if the proposed gauge theories are correct, the
dynamical mechanism responsible for the disappearing of the non symmetric operators in
the ir has still to be claried.

it would be quite helpful to have a description of the conifold as a deformation of
an orbifold singularity [4, 12].
it would provide an holographic description of the rg
ow between two dierent cft theories and it would also help in checking whether the
proposed gauge theories are correct or require to be slightly modied by the introduction
of new elds. in general, dierent orbifold theories can ow to the same conifold cft in
the ir. in the case of t 1,1, one can deform a z2 orbifold theory with a mass term [4] or a
z2  z2 orbifold theory with a fi parameter [12]. the mass deformation approach for a
z2 z2 singularity was attempted for the case of q1,1,1 in [42], where a candidate conifold
cft was written. this theory is deeply dierent from our proposal. it is not obvious to
us whether this theory is compatible or not with the kk expectations. it also seems that,
in the approach followed in [42], the singletons degrees of freedom needed for constructing
the kk spectrum are not the elementary chiral elds of the gauge theory but are rather
obtained with some change of variables which should make sense only in the ir. the
fi approach was pursued in [43], were q1,1,1 was identied as a deformation of orbifold
singularities whose associated cfts can be explicitly written. unfortunately, the order
of the requested orbifold group and, consequently, the number of requested gauge factors,
make dicult an explicit analysis of these models and the identication of the conifold
cft. it would be quite interesting to investigate the relation between the results in [43]
and our proposal or to nd simpler orbifold singularities related to q1,1,1 and m 1,1,1. for
the latter one, for the moment, no candidate orbifold has been proposed.

we did not discuss at all the cft associated to v5,2 and n 0,1,0. the absence of a
toric description makes more dicult to guess a gauge theory with the right properties
and also to nd associated orbifold models. we leave for the future the investigation of
these interesting models.

a the scalar potential

let us now consider more closely the scalar potential of the n = 2 worldvolume gauge
theories we have conjectured to be associated with the q1,1,1 and m 1,1,1 compactications.
in complete generality, the scalar potential of a three dimensional n = 2 gauge theory
with an arbitrary gauge group and an arbitrary number of chiral multiplets in generic
representations of the gaugegroup was written in eq. (5.46) of [36]. it has the following
form:

u(z, z, m) = iw (z)ij

(a.1)

where:

1. zi are the complex scalar elds belonging to the chiral multiplets,

2. w (z) is the holomorphic superpotential,

3. the hermitian matrices (ti)ij (i = 1, . . . , dimg) are the generators of the gauge
group g in the (in general reducible) representation r supported by the chiral
multiplets,

4. ij is the g invariant metric,
5. gij is the killing metric of g,
6. mi are the real scalar elds belonging to the vector multiplets that obviously trans-

form in ad (g) ,

7.  is the coecient of the chernsimons term, if present,

the gauge lie algebra ej  z(g).

8. ej are the coecients of the fayet iliopoulos terms that take values in the center of
if we put the chern simons and the fayet iliopoulos terms to zero  = ej = 0, the scalar

potential becomes the sum of three quadratic forms:

u(z, z, m) = |w (z)|2 + 1

2gij di(z, z ) dj (z, z) + m i m j kij(z, z),

where the real functions

di(z, z) = zi

(ti)ijzj

(a.2)

(a.3)

are the dterms, namely the onshell values of the vector multiplet auxiliary elds, while
by denition we have put

kij(z, z) def= zi

(ti)ijjk

(tj )klzl.

(a.4)

if the quadratic form mi mj kij (z, z) is positive denite, then the vacua of the gauge
theory are singled out by the three conditions

w
zi = 0,
di(z, z) = 0,
mi mj kij (z, z) = 0.

(a.5)

(a.6)
(a.7)

the basic relation between the candidate superconformal gauge theory cf t3 and the
compactifying 7manifold m 7 that we have used in eq.s (3.2, 3.5) is that, in the higgs

52

branch (hmii = 0), the space of vacua of cf t3, described by eq.s (a.5, a.6, a.7), should
be equal to the product of n copies of m 7:

/n .

(a.8)

vacua of gauge theory = m 7  . . .  m 7
}

{z

|

n

indeed, if there are n m2branes in the game, each of them can be placed somewhere in
m 7 and the vacuum is described by giving all such locations. in order for this to make
sense it is necessary that

 the higgs branch should be distinct from the coulomb branch
 the vanishing of the dterms should indeed be a geometric description of (a.8).

let us apply our general formula to the two cases under consideration and see that these
conditions are indeed veried.

a.1 the scalar potential in the q1,1,1 case

here the gauge group is

in the nonabelian case n > 1 and

g = su(n)1  su(n)2  su(n)3

(a.9)

g = u(1)1  u(1)2  u(1)3

(a.10)
in the abelian case n = 1. the chiral elds ai, bj, c are in the su(2)3 avor representa-
tions (1/2, 0, 0), (0, 1/2, 0), (0, 0, 1/2) and in the color su(n)3 representations (n, n, 1),
(1, n, n), ( n, 1, n), respectively (see g.1). we can arrange the chiral elds into a column
vector:

naming (ti)
 the n  n hermitian matrices such that i ti span the su(n) lie algebra
(i = 1, . . . , n 2  1), the generators of the gauge group acting on the chiral elds can be
written as follows:

(a.16)

eq.s (a.15) and (a.16) are what we have used in our toric description of q1,1,1 as the
manifold of gaugetheory vacua in the higgs branch.
indeed it is evident from eq.
(a.16) that if we give non vanishing vev to the chiral elds, then we are forced to put
< m1 >=< m2 >=< m3 >= m. alternatively, if we give non trivial vevs to the vector
multiplet scalars mi, then we are forced to put < ai >=< bj >=< c >= 0 which
conrms that the coulomb branch is separated from the higgs branch.

finally, from eq.s (a.13, a.14) we can retrieve the vacua describing n separated

branes. each chiral eld has two color indices and is actually a matrix. setting

once again from eq.s (a.24) and (a.25) we see that the higgs and coulomb branches are
separated. furthermore, in eq. (a.24) we recognize the toric description of m 1,1,1 as the
manifold of gaugetheory vacua in the higgs branch (see eq. (3.5)).

as before, from eq.s (a.13, a.14) we can retrieve the vacua describing n separated

branes. in this case the color index structure is more involved and we must set

a little work shows that the potential (a.13) vanishes if each of the ndoublets u

separately satises the dterm equations yielding the toric description of a m 1,1,1 manifold
(3.5). similarly, for each abelian generator belonging to the cartan subalgebra of ui(n)
and having a non trivial action on u

b the other homogeneous sasakian 7-manifolds

in this appendix we briey discuss the other three homogeneous sasakians of dimension 7,
giving a description of their realizations as circle bundles, the corresponding embeddings
of the base manifolds and computing their cohomology.

b.1 the manifold n 0,1,0

next we have g = su(3), h = u(1) is generated by h1 + 2h2 and eh = u(1)  u(1) is

the maximal torus. accordingly

ma = f(1, 2; 3)

(b.1)

is the complete ag variety of lines inside planes in c3. a realization of this variety is
given by parametrizing separately the lines and the planes by p2  p2 and then imposing
the incidence relation
(b.2)

kkzk = 0,

where zi and i are homogeneous coordinates on p2 and p2. notice that this relation is
the singleton in the tensor product c3  c3.

the generator of the bre is h2, so

exp(ih1)  eh = exp(2ih2)h,
exp(ih2)  eh = exp(ih2)h,

this time dimh 0(ma, l) = 8 and the embedding space is p7; the ideal of the image is

showing that n 0,1,0 is the circle bundle inside o(1, 1) over the ag variety f(1, 2; 3).
generated by 36  27 = 9 equations.
we now list the cohomology groups. since f(1, 2; 3) is a p1-bundle over p2, we can
again apply the gysin sequence to this s2 bration to compute its cohomology. this
turns out to be z[1, 2]/h3
2i; the chern class of l is c1 = 1 + 2. we can now apply
the gysin sequence to the sasakian bration, getting

1, 2

h 1(n 0,1,0, z) = h 6(n 0,1,0, z) = 0,
h 3(n 0,1,0, z) = h 4(n 0,1,0, z) = 0,
h 2(n 0,1,0, z) = z  1,
h 5(n 0,1,0, z) = z  ,

(b.3)

where  = 2

1  12, and the pullbacks are left implicit.

b.2 the manifold v5,2

the last sasakian is v5,2 = so(5)/so(3), where so(3) acts on the rst three basis vectors

of r5. here eh is so(3) so(2); so ma is the homogeneous space so(5)/so(3) so(2),

which is actually a quadric in p4. to see this, recall the isomorphism spin(5)  sp(2, h),
the compact form of sp(4, c). this last group is of rank 2 and has two maximal parabolic
subgroups. the two simple roots can be chosen as l1  l2 and 2l2 [62]. the parabolic
subgroup we are interested in is given by marking the long root 2l2, i.e. by adding to
the borel subalgebra the vector y1,2 with root l1 + l2. a little calculation shows that

56

the parabolic subalgebra we get in this way is the span of the cartan subalgebra and the
root vectors with roots 2l1, 2l2, l1 + l2, l1  l2,l1 + l2. the corresponding matrices
have the block form

(b.4)

0 at (cid:19) ,
(cid:18) a b

with a generic and b symmetric 2  2 matrices. as such it is clear that it stabilizes a
2-plane in c4. on the other hand, sp(4, c) acts on 2c4  c6, with plucker coordinates
pij = aibjajbi, (i < j), preserving the standard symplectic form m = p13+p24. summing
up, this action preserves the intersection of the plucker quadric p12p34p13p24 +p14p23 = 0
with the hyperplane p13 + p24 = 0. therefore ma is a quadric in p4.

the character of eh is simply the projection on so(2), which is the fundamental

character associated to the parabolic subgroup above. hence, v5,2 is the circle bundle
inside the restriction of o(1) over p4 to the quadric ma; the embedding is the trivial one,
and there is just 15  14 = 1 equation (the quadric itself).
in this case it is more direct to observe that v5,2 is an s3-bundle over s4. in fact it
is the cone over the quadric in p4 intersected with s10 and this is in turn isomorphic to
the unit sphere bundle in the tangent bundle of s4. the gysin sequence gives that the
only non-vanishing cohomology groups are h 0(v5,2, z) = h 7(v5,2, z) = z and possibly
h 4(v5,2, z) which is torsion.

b.3 sasakian brations over p3

recall [60] that every homogeneous sasakian-einstein 7-manifolds is a circle bundle over
an algebraic homogeneous space of complex dimension 3. there is one missing in the list
above, namely p3. as we already mentioned, there is another maximal parabolic subgroup
p  sp(4, c) given by marking the short root l1  l2. after a suitable weyl action, the
compact form u(1)  su(2) of p is embedded in sp(2, h) as

ei
0
0 u
0
0



0
0

ei ,

(b.5)

where u is in su(2). as such it stabilizes a line in a 3-plane in c4. if we look at the
bration p : f(1, 3; 4)  p3 given by forgetting the second element of the ags v1  v3,
we see that the map v1 7 v1  kerm(v1,) is a section of p which is sp(2, h) invariant.
ma is the image of this section and hence

sp(2, h)/u(1)  su(2)  p3.

(b.6)

it is clear that the sasakian bration is m 7 = sp(2, h)/su(2)  s7 and obviously
s7/u(1) = p3. notice that s7/su(2) = p1(h) = s4 and we have a commutative diagram

s7
u(1) 
p3

id

s 2



s7
 su(2)
s4

,

(b.7)

where the action of sp(2, h) on p3 preserves the bration given by the bottom line. if
we forget about this bration, p3 can be considered a homogeneous space of su(4) and

57

again the sasakian bration over it is s7. there are two more ways of getting s7 as a
homogeneous space (namely so(8)/so(7) and so(7)/g2), but the action of the group
does not preserve the u(1) bration over p3.

c the necessary symmetrization of color indices

in this appendix we show that the symmetrization of avor indices for the chiral operators
of the m 1,1,1 theory implies the symmetrization of the color indices. for this purpose, let
us concentrate on the indices of one of the two su(n) color groups.

the problem is to construct uncolored elds polynomially depending (meaning totally
symmetric) on the u i
a . since these elds belong to the irreps sym2(cn ) and
sym3(cn) respectively, we need 3k us and 2k v s to have the right number of indices to
saturate. hence, we have to nd dual irreducible subrepresentations in the decompositions

 and v 

sym3k(sym2(cn )) = sym6k(cn )  w,
sym2k(sym3(cn)) = sym6k(cn)  w.

the rst two terms in these decompositions are obviously paired. we claim that these are
the only ones. if there is another pair of irreps w, w which are dual, then each must
be invariant under both the permutation subgroups h1 = 2k  3 and h2 = 3k  2
of 6k. so we have only to show that these subgroups generate the whole 6k.
first observe that we can order 6k letters in 2k triples in such a way that h1 acts with
3 permuting letters of the rst triple, and 2k permuting the triples. the action of h2 is
faithful but otherwise arbitrary. to these actions we can associate a graph whose vertices
are the triples and whose links connect the triples which contain letters permuted by 2;
3k permutes the links, while 2k permutes vertices. notice that each link connects in fact
two precise letters within triples; it doesnt matter which ones, since there is symmetry
within each triple.

if two vertices are connected by a link we can permute any two letters in these vertices,
using 3 within every single vertex and 2 exchanging the letters at the endpoints of the
links. thus, we have the action of the full symmetric group of the letters belonging to
every connected component of the graph.

if there are two disconnected components, we can permute a letter in one component
with a letter in the other as follows. first permute the nodes to which they belong by
the action of 2k; then use the symmetric group of each component to put the extra two
letters of each involved triple at the endpoints of a link. next exchange the couple of
links got in this way by an action of 3k. finally use again the symmetric group of each
component to restore the sequence of letters we started from, except for the two which
have been exchanged.

summing up this proves that, if we consider combinations of the us and v s com-
pletely symmetric on avor indices, the structure of the saturation of the color indices is
unique: the totally symmetric one saturated with its dual.
