abstract

we conjecture that the neutral black hole pair production is related to the

vacuum uctuation of pure gravity via the casimir-like energy. a general-

ization of this process to a multi-black hole pair is considered. implications

on the foam-like structure of spacetime and on the cosmological constant are

discussed.

i. introduction

it was j. a. wheeler who rst conjectured that spacetime could be subjected to topology

uctuation at the planck scale [1]. this means that spacetime undergoes a deep and rapid

transformation in its structure. this changing spacetime is best known as spacetime foam,

which can be taken as a model for the quantum gravitational vacuum. some authors have

investigated the eects of such a foamy space on the cosmological constant, one example is

the celebrated coleman mechanism involving wormholes [2]. nevertheless, how to realize

such a foam-like space is still unknown as too is whether this represents the real quantum

gravitational vacuum. for this purpose, we begin to consider the simplest quantum process

that could approximate the foam structure in absence of matter elds, that is the black hole

1

pair creation. dierent examples are known on this subject. the rst example involves the

study of black hole pair creation in a background magnetic eld represented by the ernst

solution [3] which asymptotically approaches the melvin metric [4]. another example is the

schwarzschild-desitter metric (sds) which asymptotically approaches the desitter metric.

the extreme version is best known as the nariai metric [5]. in this case the background is

represented by the cosmological constant  acting on the neutral black hole pair produced,

accelerating the components away from each other. finally another example is given by

the schwarzschild metric which asymptotically approaches the at metric and depends only

on the mass parameter m. metrics of this type are termed asymptotically at (a.f.).

another metric which has the property of being a.f. is the reissner-nordstrom metric,

which depends on two parameters: the mass m and the charge q of the electromagnetic

eld. nevertheless, all the cases mentioned above introduce an external background eld

like the magnetic eld or the cosmological constant to produce the pair and accelerate the

components far away. in this letter, we would like to consider the same process without the

contribution of external elds, except gravity itself and consider the possible implications on

the foam-like structure of spacetime. this choice linked to the vacuum einsteins equations

leads to the schwarzschild and the at metrics, where only the simplest case is considered,

i.e. metrics which are spherically symmetric. since the a.f. spacetimes are non-compact a

subtraction scheme is needed to recover the correct equations under the constraint of xed

induced metrics on the boundary [6,7].

ii. quasilocal energy and entropy in presence of a

bifurcation surface

although it is not necessary for the forthcoming discussions, let us consider the maximal

analytic extension of the schwarzschild metric, i.e., the kruskal manifold whose spatial slices
 represent einstein-rosen bridges with wormhole topology s2  r1. following ref. [6],
the complete manifold m can be taken as a model for an eternal black hole composed of

2

two wedges m+ and m located in the right and left sectors of a kruskal diagram. the
hypersurface  is divided in two parts + and  by a bifurcation two-surface s0. on 
we can write the gravitational hamiltonian

1

2z
hp = h  h0 =
d2xn(cid:16)k  k0(cid:17) 

+

1

zs+

d3x(nh+n ihi)

1

zs

d2xn(cid:16)k  k0(cid:17) ,

(1)

where  = 8g. the hamiltonian has both volume and boundary contributions. the

volume part involves the hamiltonian and momentum constraints

h = (2) gijklijkl q3gr/ (2) = 0,

hi = 2j

i|j = 0,

(2)

where gijkl = (gikgjl + gilgjk  gijgkl) /(cid:16)2g(cid:17) and r denotes the scalar curvature of the

surface . the volume part of the hamiltonian (1) is zero when the hamiltonian and

momentum constraints are imposed. however, for the at and the schwarzschild space,

constraints are immediately satised, then in this context the total hamiltonian reduces to

hp =

1

zs+

d2xn(cid:16)k  k0(cid:17) 

1

zs

d2xn(cid:16)k  k0(cid:17) .

(3)

quasilocal energy is dened as the value of the hamiltonian that generates unit time trans-

lations orthogonal to the two-dimensional boundaries, i.e.

1

etot = e+  e,

d2x(cid:16)k  k0(cid:17)

e+ =

e = 

(4)

where |n| = 1 at both s+ and s. etot is the quasilocal energy of a spacelike hypersurface
 = +   bounded by two boundaries 3s+ and 3s located in the two disconnected

3

regions m+ and m respectively. we have included the subtraction terms k0 for the energy.
k0 represents the trace of the extrinsic curvature corresponding to embedding in the two-

dimensional boundaries 2s+ and 2s in three-dimensional euclidean space. let us consider
the case of the static einstein-rosen bridge whose metric is dened as:

ds2 = n 2dt2 + gyydy2 + r2 (y) d2,

(5)

r . if we make the identication n 2 = 1  2m

where n, gyy, and r are functions of the radial coordinate y continuously dened on m,
with dy = dr/q1  2m
r , the line element (5)
reduces to the s metric written in another form. the boundaries 2s+ and 2s are located
at coordinate values y = y+ and y = y respectively. the normal to the boundaries is
n = (hyy)
y . since this normal is dened continuously along , the value of k depends
on the function r,y, which is positive for 2b+ and negative for 2b. the application of the
quasilocal energy denition gives

1

2 

e = e+  e

=(cid:16)r |r,y |h1  (hyy)

1

2i(cid:17)y=y+ (cid:16)r |r,y |h1  (hyy)

1

2i(cid:17)y=y

.

(6)

it is easy to see that e+ and e tend individually to the adm mass m when the boundaries
3b+ and 3b tend respectively to right and left spatial innity. it should be noted that
the total energy is zero for boundary conditions symmetric with respect to the bifurcation

surface, i.e.,

e = e+  e = m + (m) = 0,

(7)

where the asymptotic contribution has been considered. the same behaviour appears in the

entropy calculation for the physical system under examination. indeed

stot = s+  s = exp  a+
4 

a

4 !  exp(cid:18)ah
4 

ah

4 (cid:19) = exp (0) ,

(8)

where a+ and a have the same meaning as e+ and e. note that for both entropy and
energy this result is obtained at zero loop. we can also see eqs. (7) and (8) from a dierent

4

point of view. in fact these eqs. say that at space can be thought of as a composition of

two pieces: the former, with positive energy, in the region + and the latter, with negative

energy, in the region , where the positive and negative concern the bifurcation surface
(hole) which is formed due to a topology change of the manifold. the most appropriate

mechanism to explain this splitting seems to be a black hole pair creation.

iii. black hole pair creation

the formation of neutral black hole pairs with the two holes residing in the same universe

is believed to be a highly suppressed process, at least for   1 in plancks units [8]. the
metric which describes such pair creation is the nariai metric. when the cosmological

constant is absent the sds metric is reduced to the schwarzschild metric which concerns

a single black hole. however, one could regard each single schwarzschild black hole in our

universe as a mere part of a neutral pair, with the partner residing in the other universe. in

this case the whole spacetime can be regarded as a black-hole pair formed up by a black hole

with positive mass m in the coordinate system of the observer and an anti black-hole with

negative mass m in the system where the observer is not present. from the instantonic
point of view, one can represent neutral black hole pairs as instantons with zero total energy.

an asymptotic observer in one universe would interpret each such pair as being formed by

one black hole with positive mass m. what such an observer would actually observe from

the pair is only either a black hole with positive energy or a wormhole mouth opening to

the observers universe, interpreting that the black hole in the other universe has negative

mass without violating the positive-energy theorems [14,15]. this scenario gives spacetime

a dierent structure.

indeed it is well known that at spacetime cannot spontaneously

generate a black hole, otherwise energy conservation would be violated. in other terms we

cannot compare spacetimes with dierent asymptotic behaviour [16]. the dierent boundary

conditions reect on the fact that at space is not periodic in euclidean time which means

that the temperature is zero. on the other hand a black hole with an imaginary time

5

necessitates periodicity, but this implies a temperature dierent from zero. then, unless at

spacetime has a temperature t equal to the black hole temperature, there is no chance for a

transition from at to curved spacetime. this transition is a decay from the false vacuum to

the true one [1013]. however, taking account a pair of neutral black holes living in dierent

universes, there is no decay and more important no temperature is necessary to change from

at to curved space. this could be related with a vacuum uctuation of the metric which

can be measured by the casimir energy.

iv. casimir energy

one can in general formally dene the casimir energy as follows

ecasimir [m] = e0 [m]  e0 [0] ,

(9)

where e0 is the zero-point energy and m is a boundary. for zero temperature, the idea
underlying the casimir eect is to compare vacuum energies in two physical distinct cong-

urations. we can recognize that the expression which denes quasilocal energy is formally of

the casimir type. indeed, the subtraction procedure present in eq.(3) describes an energy

dierence between two distinct situations with the same boundary conditions. however,

while the expression contained in eq.(3) is only classical, the casimir energy term has a

quantum nature. one way to escape from this disagreeable situation is the induced grav-

ity point of view discussed in ref. [17] and refs. therein. however, in those papers the

subtraction procedure in the energy term is generated by the zero point quantum uctua-

tions of matter elds. nevertheless, we are working in the context of pure gravity, therefore

quasilocal energy has to be interpreted as the zero loop or tree level approximation to the

true casimir energy. to this end it is useful to consider a generalized subtraction procedure

extended to the volume term up to the quadratic order. this corresponds to the semiclas-

sical approximation of quasilocal energy. what are the possible eects on the foam-like

scenario? suppose we enlarge this process from one pair to a large but xed number of

6

such pairs, say n. what we obtain is a multiply connected spacetime with n holes inside

the manifold, each of them acting as a single bifurcation surface with the sole condition of

having symmetry with respect to the bifurcation surface even at nite distance. let us see

in which way such a spacetime can be modeled.

v. spacetime foam: the model

in the one-wormhole approximation we have used an eternal black hole, to describe a

complete manifold m, composed of two wedges m+ and m located in the right and left
sectors of a kruskal diagram. the spatial slices  represent einstein-rosen bridges with
wormhole topology s2  r1. also the hypersurface  is divided in two parts + and  by
a bifurcation two-surface s0. we begin with the line element

ds2 = n 2 (r) dt2 +

dr2
1  2m

r

+ r2(cid:16)d2 + sin2 d2(cid:17)

and we consider the physical hamiltonian dened on

both satised by the schwarzschild and flat metric respectively. the supermetric is gijkl =
2 (gikgjl + gilgjk  gijgkl) and r(3) denotes the scalar curvature of the surface . by using
the expression of the trace

k =

(13)

with the normal to the boundaries dened continuously along  as n = (hyy)

y . the

value of k depends on the function r,y, where we have assumed that the function r,y is

positive for s+ and negative for s. we obtain at either boundary that

k = 2r,y

r

.

(14)

the trace associated with the subtraction term is taken to be k0 = 2/r for b+ and k0 = 2/r
for b. then the quasilocal energy with subtraction terms included is

equasilocal = l2

p (e+  e) = l2

ph(r [1  |r,y |])y=y+  (r [1  |r,y |])y=yi .

(15)

note that the total quasilocal energy is zero for boundary conditions symmetric with respect

to the bifurcation surface s0 and this is the necessary condition to obtain instability with

respect to the at space. in this sector satisfy the constraint equations (3). here we consider

perturbations at  of the type

gij = gij + hij,

(16)

where gij is the spatial part of the schwarzschild and flat background in a wkb approxi-

mation. in this framework we have computed the quantity

e (m) = d(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)h schw.  h f lat(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) e

h|i

+ h|hquasilocal| i

h|i

,

(17)

by means of a variational approach, where the wkb functionals are substituted with trial

wave functionals. this quantity is the natural extension to the volume term of the subtrac-

tion procedure for boundary terms and it is interpreted as the casimir energy related to

vacuum uctuations. by restricting our attention to the graviton sector of the hamiltonian

approximated to second order, hereafter referred as h|2, we dene

e|2 = d(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)h|2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) e

(22)

where v is the volume of the system and r0 is related to the minimum radius compatible with

the wormhole throat. we know that the classical minimum is achieved when r0 = 2mg.

however, it is likely that quantum processes come into play at short distances, where the

wormhole throat is dened, introducing a quantum radius r0 > 2mg. we now compute

the minimum of e (m), after having rescaled the variable m to a scale variable x =

3mg/ (r3

02). thus

e (m)  e (x, ) =

nevertheless, there exists another part of the spectrum which has to be considered: the

discrete spectrum containing one mode. this gives the energy an imaginary contribution,

namely we have discovered an unstable mode [18,19]. let us briey recall, how this appears.

the eigenvalue equation

(2)a

(24)

can be studied with the regge-wheeler method. the perturbations can be divided in odd

and even components. the appearance of the unstable mode is governed by the gravitational

10

(28)

to be compared with the value e2 = . 19/ (mg)2 of ref. [18]. nevertheless, when we
compute the eigenvalue as a function of the distance y, we discover that in the limit y  0,

(30)

it is evident that there exists a critical radius where  turns from negative to positive. this

critical value is located at c = 1. 113 4 to be compared with the value c = 1.445 obtained by

b. allen in [20]. what is the relation with the large number of wormholes? as mentioned

in i, when the number of wormholes grows, to keep the coherency assumption valid, the

space available for every single wormhole has to be reduced to avoid overlapping of the wave

functions. if we x the initial boundary at r, then in presence of nw wormholes, it will
be reduced to r/nw. this means that boundary conditions are not xed at innity, but
at a certain nite radius and the adm mass term is substituted by the quasilocal energy

expression under the condition of having symmetry with respect to each bifurcation surface.

the eect on the unstable mode is clear: as nw grows, the boundary radius reduces more

and more until it will reach the critical value c below which no negative mode will appear

corresponding to a critical wormholes number nwc. to this purpose, suppose to consider

i, with
nw wormholes and assume that there exists a covering of  such that  =
i  j =  when i 6= j. each i has the topology s2  r1 with boundaries i with
respect to each bifurcation surface. on each surface i, quasilocal energy gives

nwsi=1

(31)

thus if we apply the same procedure of the single case on each wormhole, we obtain

ei quasilocal = l2

p (ei+  ei) = l2

p (r [1  |r,y |])y=yi+  l2

p (r [1  |r,y |])y=yi

.

(32)

note that the total quasilocal energy is zero for boundary conditions symmetric with respect

to each bifurcation surface s0,i. we are interested in a large number of wormholes, each of

11

them contributing with a term of the type (7). if the wormholes number is nw, we obtain

(semiclassically, i.e., without self-interactions)1

thus the total energy for the collection is

the same happens for the trial wave functional which is the product of nw t.w.f.. thus

the fourth power of the cuto (or the inverse of the fourth power of the region of dimension

quence a positive cosmological constant is induced by such uctuations. the probability of

this process in a euclidean time (not periodically identied) is

thus we recover the hawking result about the cosmological constant approaching zero. note

that the vanishing of c is related to the growing of the holes. even if this assemblage of

coherent wormholes seems to have the right trend to describe both a spacetime foam and a

quantum gravitational vacuum, we have a lot of problems to solve and other corrections to

include:
