asymptotic zero energy states for su(n  3)

abstract

some ideas are presented concerning the question which of the harmonic
wavefunctions constructed in [hep-th/9909191] may be annihilated by all
supercharges.

in an attempt to extend our knowledge about the asymptotic form of zero-
energy wave functions of su(n) invariant supersymmetric matrix models beyond
n = 2, it was recently shown [1], for n = 3, how to construct weyl  spin(d)
invariant asymptotic states out of the cartan-subalgebra degrees of freedom. to
nd out which of these harmonic wavefunctions is annihilated by the asymptotic
supercharges [2]

q = it

t = 1, . . . , d = (2), 3, 5 or 9

,  = 1, . . . , sd = 2, 4, 8 resp. 16

k = 1, 2

is non-trivial. the guess presented in this note will hopefully be a rst step1.
should the answer really be that for arbitrary n , already for this free problem,
exactly one supersymmetric state exists for d = 9 (and none for d = 2, 3, 5), this
should obviously have a simple (deep?) mathematical explanation, of more
general relevance.

each harmonic state, constructed in [1], has the form

 = xl,s,r,m

r2l2(d1) sr

lm (x1, x2)|s  r; mi

(2)

with l=0,1,. . . , sr
lm a harmonic polynomial of degree l (in the variables x1, x2;
r := px2
2) transforming under the weyl-group (the permutation group s3)
and spin(d) according to the irreducible representation s(= 1, or ), cf. [1],

1 + x2

1a detailed calculation of the matrix element (13) is under investigation by j. plefka.

resp. r, m = 1, 2, . . . dim(s  r), and |s  r; mi is the corresponding basis-
vector in a s  r representation present in the fermionic fock-space h(d) =
h2
sd (cf. [1]). as pointed out by m. bordemann, one way to construct
a state that will be annihilated by all the supercharges, is to let

with  being any of the harmonic states (2). the crucial question is: for which
 will (3) be non-zero? let d = 9 now (sd = 16). the guess which i would like
to discuss here, is that

 = r16|1i

(4)
will do, where |1i is the unique weyl  spin(9) invariant state in h = h256 
h256. why (4)? one simple reason(ing) is the following: as each q, acting on
the product of a harmonic, homogenous polynomial and a negative power of r
will increase the degree of the polynomial, (4) is the only harmonic state which
certainly (a priori!) can not be the image of q acting on some harmonic .
actually, if we could show that all harmonic s not containing a contribution
from l = 0 are of the form

 = x

q

(5)

with  harmonic, (4) would necessarily be the only chance left, as (3) is clearly
identically zero, if  is of the form (5).

in any case, consider now

 := 1 16 q1  q2  q16

1
r16 |1i

(6)

is it zero? first of all, one needs to know more explicitly, what the state |1i  h
is.

as h256 contains only 3 irreducible spin(9) representations,

h256 = 44  84  128

h contains only 3 spin(9) singlets, namely
:= xs,t
:= xs,t,u
:= xt,

|1i128

|1i44

|1i84

|sti|sti

|stui|stui

|ti|ti .

(7)

for notational simplicity, the fermions k=2 are sometimes denoted by 

, and

|sti = |tsi (ps |ssi = 0), |stui (totally antisymmetric in s, t, u) and |ti(with

t
|ti = 0) stands for the basis-elements of the 44,84, resp. 128-dimensional
representation.

in any case, as one of the weyl-transformations changes 
 (while leaving
 invariant), |1i128 can not be contained in the weyl-invariant state |1i, which
therefore must be a linear combination of |1i44 and |1i84
projecting (6) onto this linear combination will give some weyl  spin(9)
invariant dierential operator of degree 16 (with constant coecients), acting
on r16. while r. suter and i checked, by using quite dierent methods, that
a priori only 2 such independent operators, not containing the full laplace-
operator (which annihilates r16!) exist, one needs to know

should the result turn out to be non-zero, (6) will, by construction, be a
non-trivial supersymmetric wave function. for general n > 2 the corresponding
asymptotic fall o would be r((n 1)d+14).

a simpler way to describe the fermionic part of the wavefunction is to dene

fermionic creation operators
