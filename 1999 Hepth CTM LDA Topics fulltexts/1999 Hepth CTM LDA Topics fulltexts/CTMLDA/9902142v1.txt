abstract. a special class of solutions to the generalised wdvv equations related
to a nite set of covectors is investigated. some geometric conditions on such a set
which guarantee that the corresponding function satises wdvv equations are found
(-conditions). these conditions are satised for all root systems and their special
deformations discovered in the theory of the calogero-moser systems by o.chalykh,
m.feigin and the author. this leads to the new solutions for the generalized wdvv
equations.

introduction.

the generalised wdvv (witten-dijgraaf-verlinde-verlinde) equations are the
following overdetermined system of nonlinear dierential equations:

fif 1

k fj = fj f 1

k fi,

i, j, k = 1, . . . , n,

(1)

where fm is the n  n matrix constructed from the third partial derivatives of
the unknown function f = f (x1, . . . , xn):

(fm)pq =

3 f

xmxpxq

,

(2)

in this form these equations have been presented by a.marshakov,a.mironov
and a.morozov, who showed that the seiberg-witten prepotential in n = 2
four-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories satises this system [1]. orig-
inally these equations appeared in a slightly dierent form as associativity con-
ditions in topological eld theory (see [2]).

in the recent paper [3] it has been shown that for any root system r  rn

of a semisimple lie algebra of rank n the function

f (x) =

1

4 xr

(, x)2log (, x)2

(3)

satises the wdvv equations (1,2).

our rst observation is that this is actually true for all the coxeter cong-

urations related to any nite reection group.

the second, main observation is that the function (3) satises wdvv equa-
tion also for certain deformations of the root systems discovered by o.chalykh,
m.feigin and the author [4, 5, 6]. the corresponding families of the new solu-
tions to wdvv equations have the form

f =

where the real parameters k, m, l satisfy the only relation

k(2l + 1) = 2m + 1.

when m = 1 the formula (4) gives the well-known solution to wdvv equations,
corresponding to the leading perturbative approximation to the exact seiberg-
witten prepotential for the gauge group su (n + 1) (see [1]). for the general
m it corresponds to the deformation an(m) of the root system an related to
the lie algebra su(n + 1) (see [4] and below). the formula (5) with k = m =
l = 1 correspond to the root system cn+1, the general case - to its deformation
cn+1(m, l) (see [6]).

actually i will describe some geometric conditions (-conditions) on the set
of the covectors , which guarantee that the corresponding function (3) satises
the generalised wdvv equations. the roots systems and their deformations
mentioned above satisfy these conditions. the classication of all -systems
seems to be an interesting open problem.

1 -systems and particular solutions to wdvv

equations.

lets rst remind the following observation from [1, 7] that wdvv equations
(1), (2) are equivalent to the equations

fig1fj = fj g1fi,

i, j = 1, . . . , n,

(7)

n

pk=1

where g =

kfk is any particular invertible linear combination of fi with

the coecients, which may depend on x. introducing the matrices fi = g1fi
one can rewrite (7) as the commutativity relations

(cid:2) fi, fj(cid:3) = 0,

i, j = 1, . . . , n,

(8)

let us consider now the following particular class of the solutions to these equa-
tions.

let v be a real linear vector space of dimension n, v  be its dual space con-
sisting of the linear functions on v (covectors), a be a nite set of noncollinear
covectors   v .

consider the following function on v :

f a = xa

(, x)2 log (, x)2,

(9)

where (, x) = (x) is the value of covector   v  on a vector x  v . for any
basis e1, . . . , en we have the corresponding coordinates x1, . . . , xn in v and the
matrices fi dened according to (2). in a more invariant form for any vector
a  v one can dene the matrix

n

fa =

aifi.

xi=1

(10)

by a straightforward calculation one can check the following

lemma. for a function (9) fa is the matrix of the following bilinear form

on v

f a

a = xa

(, a)
(, x)

  ,

(11)

where   (u, v) = (u)(v) for any u, v  v and ,   v .

now let us choose ga as f a
x :

ga =

n

xi=1

xifi.

then, according to the lemma ga is a matrix of the bilinear form

ga = xa

  , ga(u, v) = xa

(, u)(, v).

(12)

notice that ga does not depend on x.

we will assume that ga is non-degenerate, which in the real case means that
the covectors   a generate v . this means that the natural linear mapping
a : v  v  dened by the formula

(a(u), v) = ga(u, v), u, v  v

is invertible. we will denote 1
v  v

a (),   v  as . by denition, for any
(13)

(, )(, v).

(, v) = xa

now let us dene the operator

f a
a = xa

(, a)
(, x)

  

(14)

according to (8) the wdvv equations (1,2) for the function (9) are equivalent
to

(15)

(16)

for any a, b  v . a simple calculation shows that (15) can be rewritten as

a , f a
(cid:2) f a

b (cid:3) = 0

x6=,,a

ga(, )b,(a, b)

(, x)(, x)

    0,

   =       

where

and

b,(a, b) =   (a, b) = (a)(b)  (b)(a).

thus the wdvv equations for the function (9) are equivalent to the conditions
(16) to be satised for any x, a, b  v .
notice that wdvv equations (1,2) and, therefore, the conditions (16) are
obviously satised for any two-dimensional conguration a. this fact and the
structure of the relation (16) motivate the following notion of the -systems.
remind rst that for a pair of bilinear forms f and g on the vector space
v one can dene an eigenvector e as the kernel of the bilinear form f  g for
a proper :

for any v  v . when g is non-degenerate e is the eigenvector of the corre-
sponding operator f = g1f :

(f  g)(v, x) = 0

f (e) = g1f (e) = e.

now let a be as above any nite set of non-collinear covectors   v , g = ga
be the corresponding bilinear form (12), which is assumed to be non-degenerate,

4

 are dened by (13). dene now for any two-dimensional plane   v  a
form
(17)

(, x)(, y).

ga

(x, y) = xa

denition. we will say that a satises the -conditions if for any plane
  v  the vectors ,     a are the eigenvectors of the pair of the forms
ga and ga

. in this case we will call a as -system.

the -conditions can be written explicitly as

() = ,

xa

(18)

for any     a and some , which may depend on  and .
if the plane  contains no more that one vector from a then this condition
is obviously satised, so the -conditions should be checked only for a nite
number of planes .
if the plane  contains only two covectors  and  from a then the condition

(18) means that  and  are orthogonal with respect to the form ga:

() = ga(, ) = 0.

if the plane  contains more that two covectors from a this condition means

that g and g restricted to the plane   v are proportional:

g| = () g|

(19)

theorem 1. let a be any -system, then the function (9) satises the

wdvv equations (1).

proof. it is enough to prove that

x,a

ga(, )b,(a, b)

(, x)(, x)

    0

for any plane   v . when   a consists only of two covectors  and 
this follows from ga(, ) = 0, which is the -condition in this case.
if
  a consists of more that two covectors this relation is proportional to the
corresponding relation for the function

f a

(cid:12)(cid:12) = xa

(, x)2 log (, x)2(cid:12)(cid:12) .

since  is two-dimensional this is obviously satised.

2 examples of -systems: root systems and their

deformations.

let v be now euclidean vector space with a scalar product ( , ), and g be
any irreducible nite group generated by orthogonal reections with respect to
some hyperplanes (coxeter groups [8]). let r be a set of normal vectors to
the reection hyperplanes of g. we will not x the length of the normals but
assume that r is invariant under the natural action of g and contains exactly
two normal vectors for any such hyperplane. let us choose from each such pair
of vectors one of them and form the system r+:
r = r+  (r+).

usually r+ is chosen simply by taking from r vectors which are positive with
respect to some linear form on v . we will call a system r+ as coxeter system
and the vectors from r+ as roots.

theorem 2. any coxeter system r+ is a -system.
proof is very simple. first of all the form (12) in this case is proportional to
the euclidean structure on v because it is invariant under g and g is irreducible.
by the same reason this is true for the form g (17) if the plane  contains
more than two roots from r+. when  contains only two roots they must be
orthogonal and therefore satisfy -conditions.

corollary. for any coxeter system r+ the function

f = xr+

(, x)2 log (, x)2

(20)

satisfy wdvv equations (1), (2).

remark. the root systems of any semisimple lie algebra are the particular
examples of the coxeter systems. in this case this result has been proven in [3].
notice that even when g is a weyl group of some lie algebra our formula (20)
in general gives more solutions since we have not xed the length of the roots.
remarkably enough that the theorem 2 is true also for the following deforma-
tions of the root systems found in the theory of the generalised calogero-moser
systems in [4, 5, 6].

let us make rst the following remark. one can consider the class of func-
tions related to a formally more general situation when the covectors  have
also some prescribed multiplicities 

f (a,) = xa

(, x)2 log (, x)2.

(21)

but it is easy to see that this actually will give no new solutions because f (a,) =
a+ quadratic terms, where a consists of covectors .

the following congurations an(m) and cn+1(m, l) have been introduced in

[4, 5, 6]. they consist of the following vectors in rn+1:

an(m) = (cid:26) ei  ej,

ei  men+1,

1  i < j  n, with multiplicity m,
with multiplicity 1,
i = 1, . . . , n

and

cn+1(m, l) =




where k = 2m+1
2l+1 .

ei  ej,
2ei,
ei 
2ken+1

ken+1,

1  i < j  n,
i = 1, . . . , n
i = 1, . . . , n
with multiplicity l,

with multiplicity k,
with multiplicity m,
with multiplicity 1,

when all the multiplicities are integer the corresponding generalisation of
calogero-moser system is algebraically integrable, but usual integrability holds
for any value of multiplicities (see [4, 5, 6]).

notice that when m = 1 the rst conguration coincides with the classical
root system of type an and when k = m = l = 1 the second conguration is
the root system of type cn+1. so these families can be considered as the special
deformations of these roots systems.

theorem 3. for the deformed root systems an(m) and cn+1(m, l) with

arbitrary m and l the function (21) satises wdvv equation.

this follows from the simple check that the sets

and

an(m) = 


cn+1(m, l) =

1  i < j  n,
i = 1, . . . , n

kej, 1  i < j  n

i = 1, . . . , n

i = 1, . . . , n

m (ei  ej),
ei  men+1,
kei 
2mei,

ken+1,

ei 
2klen+1,




with k = 2m+1
one can rewrite these families in the following, more convenient way:

2l+1 satisfy the -conditions. making a suitable linear transformation

an(m) = 


ei  ej, 1  i < j  n,
1m

i = 1, . . . , n

ei,

7

and

cn+1(m, l) =

k(ei  ej), 1  i < j  n,
2mei,

i = 1, . . . , n

i = 1, . . . , n

ei  en+1,
2len+1,




where again k = 2m+1
2l+1 .

corresponding functions f have the form (4), (5) written in the introduction.

corollary. the functions f given by the formulas (4), (5) satisfy wdvv

equations.

at the moment i have no satisfactory explanation why the deformed root
systems arisen in the theory of the generalised calogero-moser problems turned
out to be -systems. it may be that it is a common geometrical property of all
the so-called locus congurations [6]. in this connection id like to mention that
-systems can be naturally dened in a complex vector space. all this certainly
deserves further investigation.
