abstract

the kac determinant for the topological n=2 superconformal algebra is presented
as well as a detailed analysis of the singular vectors detected by the roots of the de-
terminants. in addition we identify the standard verma modules containing no-label
singular vectors (which are not detected directly by the roots of the determinants).
we show that in standard verma modules there are (at least) four dierent types of
submodules, regarding size and shape. we also review the chiral determinant formula,
for chiral verma modules, adding new insights. finally we transfer the results obtained
to the verma modules and singular vectors of the ramond n=2 algebra, which have
been very poorly studied so far. this work claries several misconceptions and confus-
ing claims appeared in the literature about the singular vectors, verma modules and
submodules of the topological n=2 superconformal algebra.

introduction and notation

the n=2 superconformal algebras provide the symmetries underlying the n=2 strings [1][2].
these seem to be related to m-theory since many of the basic objects of m-theory are realized in
the heterotic (2,1) n=2 strings [3]. in addition, the topological version of the algebra is realized in
the world-sheet of the bosonic string [4], as well as in the world-sheet of the superstrings [5].

the topological n=2 superconformal algebra was written down in 1990 by dijkgraaf, verlinde
and verlinde [6], as the symmetry algebra of two-dimensional topological conformal eld theory
(tcft). as the authors realized, this algebra can also be obtained by twisting the neveu-schwarz
n=2 superconformal algebra following the result [7][8] that the modication of the stress-energy
tensor of a n=2 superconformal theory, by adding the derivative of the u(1) current, leads to a
topological theory, procedure known as topological twist.

a basic tool in the representation theory of innite dimensional lie algebras (and superalgebras)
is the determinant formula. this is the determinant of the matrix of inner products of a basis
for the verma modules. the zeroes of the determinant formula, which in the case of the n=2
superconformal algebras are given by vanishing surfaces involving the conformal weight , the
u(1) charge h, and the conformal anomaly c, correspond to the verma modules which contain null
vectors. the vanishing surfaces also indicate the borders between regions of positive and negative
signature of the metric and therefore the determinant formula is crucial to investigate the unitarity
and non-unitarity of the representations.

in the middle eighties the determinant formulae for the known n=2 superconformal algebras;
i.e. the antiperiodic neveu-schwarz algebra, the periodic ramond algebra and the twisted algebra,
were computed by several authors [9][10][11]. at that time the topological n=2 algebra had not
been discovered yet and the corresponding determinant formula has remained so far unpublished1.
this has not prevented, however, from making substantial progress in the study of the topological
singular vectors. for example, it has been shown [12][18] that they can be classied in 29 types
in complete verma modules and 4 types in chiral verma modules, taking into account the relative
u(1) charge and the brst-invariance properties of the vector itself and of the primary on which
it is built. in ref. [12] the complete set of topological singular vectors was explicitely constructed
at level 1, (28 types in complete verma modules as one type exists only at level 0), whereas the
rigorous proofs that these types are the only possible ones have been given in ref.
[18] together
with the maximal dimensions of the corresponding singular vector spaces (1, 2, or 3 depending on
the type of singular vector). furthermore 16 types of topological singular vectors can be mapped
[12][19] to the standard singular vectors of the neveu-schwarz n=2 algebra, for which construction
formulae are known [15][16].

two years ago the chiral n=2 determinant formulae for chiral verma modules were computed
[13] for the neveu-schwarz, the ramond, and the topological n=2 algebras. as a bonus subsingular

1the neveu-schwarz, the ramond and the topological n=2 superconformal algebras are isomorphic. however
their representation theories are dierent, what has created some confusion in the literature. we thank v. kac for
discussions on this point

vectors were discovered for these algebras. the reason is that chiral verma modules are incomplete
modules resulting from the quotient of a complete verma module by the submodule generated
by a lowest-level singular vector (level zero for the topological and ramond algebras and level
1/2 for the neveu-schwarz algebra). as a consequence, the singular vectors in the chiral verma
modules are either the surviving singular vectors which were not descendant of the lowest-level
singular vectors that are quotiented out, or they are subsingular vectors in the complete verma
module becoming singular just in the chiral verma module. both origins were traced back for the
4 types of singular vectors found in chiral verma modules [13][12]. in ref. [18] it was proved that
these four types are the only existing types of singular vectors in chiral verma modules and their
corresponding spaces are always one-dimensional.

in this paper we intend to nish the picture presenting the determinant formula for the com-
plete verma modules of the topological n=2 algebra. in section 2 we review the most basic results
regarding the verma modules and singular vectors of this algebra.
in section 3 we present the
determinant formulae for the generic (standard) verma modules and for the no-label verma mod-
ules and discuss in very much detail the types of singular vectors detected by the roots of the
determinants. in addition we review the chiral determinant formula corresponding to chiral verma
modules adding some new insights. the results obtained are transferred to the verma modules
and singular vectors of the ramond n=2 algebra, which have been very poorly analysed in the
literature. some nal remarks are made in section 4. in appendix a we identify the generic verma
modules with chiral and no-label singular vectors, and we give some examples. the latter are not
directly detected by the roots of the determinants.
in appendix b we write down all singular
vectors at level 1 in verma modules with zero conformal weight  = 0.

notation

highest weight (h.w.) vectors denote the states with lowest conformal weight. they are necessarily
annihilated by all the positive modes of the generators of the algebra, i.e. ln1|i = hn1|i =
gn1|i = qn1|i = 0 .

primary states denote h.w. vectors with non-zero norm.

secondary or descendant states denote states obtained by acting on the h.w. vectors with the
negative modes of the generators of the algebra and with the fermionic zero modes q0 and g0 .
the fermionic zero modes can also interpolate between two h.w. vectors which are on the same
footing (two primary states or two singular vectors).
chiral states |ig,q are states annihilated by both g0 and q0.
g0-closed states |ig are states annihilated by g0 but not by q0 .
q0-closed states |iq are states annihilated by q0 but not by g0 .

no-label states |i denote states that cannot be expressed as linear combinations of g0-closed,
q0-closed and chiral states.

the verma module associated to a h.w. vector consists of the h.w. vector plus the set of secondary

2

states built on it.

null vectors are states in the kernel of the inner product which therefore decouple from the whole
space of states.

singular vectors are h.w. null vectors, i.e. the states with lowest conformal weight in the null
submodules.

primitive singular vectors are the singular vectors that cannot be constructed by acting with the
generators of the algebra on another singular vector. however, the fermionic zero modes g0 and
q0 can interpolate between two primitive singular vectors at the same level (transforming one into
each other).

secondary singular vectors are singular vectors that can be constructed by acting with the generators
of the algebra on another singular vector. the level-zero secondary singular vectors cannot come
back to the singular vectors on which they are built by acting with g0 or q0 .

subsingular vectors are non-h.w. null vectors which become singular (i.e. h.w.) in the quotient of
the verma module by a submodule generated by a singular vector.

the singular vectors of the topological n=2 algebra will be denoted as topological singular vectors
|i.

the singular vectors of the ramond n=2 algebra will be denoted as r singular vectors |ri.

2 verma modules and singular vectors of the topological n=2

algebra

2.1 the topological n=2 algebra

the two possible topological twists [7][8] of the generators of the neveu-schwarz n=2 algebra

are:

w )1 l()
(t 
w )1 h()
(t 
w )1 g()

(t 

w )1 q()

(2.1)

,

where lm and hm are the bosonic generators corresponding to the stress-energy tensor (virasoro
generators) and the u(1) current, respectively, and g are the spin-3/2 fermionic generators. these
twists, which we denote as t 
w , consist of the modication of the stress-energy tensor by adding
the derivative of the u(1) current. as a result [6] the conformal spins and modes of the fermionic
elds are also modied in such a manner that the spin-3/2 generators g, with half-integer modes,
are traded by spin-1 and spin-2 generators q and g, respectively, with integer modes, the rst

3

ones having the properties of a brst current2. observe that the twists are mirrored under the
interchange hm  hm, g+

r  g
r .

the topological n=2 algebra, obtained by twisting in this way the neveu-schwarz n=2 algebra,

reads [6]

[lm, ln] = (m  n)lm+n ,
[lm, gn] = (m  n)gm+n ,
[lm, qn] = nqm+n ,
[lm, hn] = nhm+n + c
{gm, qn} = 2lm+n  2nhm+n + c

6 (m2 + m)m+n,0 ,

3 (m2 + m)m+n,0 ,

3 mm+n,0 ,

[hm, hn] = c
[hm, gn] = gm+n ,
[hm, qn] = qm+n ,

m, n  z .

(2.2)

the eigenvalues of the bosonic zero modes (l0, h0) correspond to the conformal weight and
the u(1) charge of the states. these split conveniently as ( + l, h + q) for secondary states, where
l and q are the level and the relative charge of the state and (, h) are the conformal weight and
the charge of the primary state on which the secondary is built. the topological central charge c
is the central charge corresponding to the neveu-schwarz n=2 algebra. this algebra is topological
because the virasoro generators are brst-exact, i.e. can be expressed as lm = 1
2 {gm, q0}, where
q0 is the brst charge. this implies, as is well known, that the correlators of the elds do not
depend on the two-dimensional metric [14].

w (2.1). as a result, under t +

w or t 

an important fact is that the annihilation conditions g

1/2 |n si = 0 of the neveu-schwarz n=2
algebra read g0|i = 0 after the corresponding twists t 
w any
state of the neveu-schwarz n=2 algebra annihilated by all the positive modes of the ns generators
becomes a state of the topological n=2 algebra annihilated by g0 as well as by all the positive
modes of the topological generators, as the reader can easily verify. conversely, any topological
state annihilated by g0 and by all the positive modes of the topological generators transforms into
a ns state annihilated by all the positive modes of the ns generators. the zero mode q0, in turn,
corresponds to the negative modes g
1/2. observe that a topological state not annihilated by g0 is
transformed into a ns state not annihilated by g+
1/2 . consequently, the neveu-schwarz
counterpart of the topological primaries and singular vectors not annihilated by g0 are not primary
states and singular vectors themselves but rather they are secondary states of no special type,
or they are subsingular vectors. to be precise, the q0-closed topological primaries correspond to
ns secondary states obtained by acting with g+
1/2 on the ns primaries, the q0-closed
topological singular vectors with non-zero conformal weight correspond to null descendants of ns
singular vectors, and the q0-closed topological singular vectors with zero conformal weight and the
no-label topological singular vectors correspond to ns subsingular vectors [17]. as to the no-label
topological primaries, they do not have ns counterpart.

1/2 or by g

1/2 or g

2let us stress that the modication of the stress-energy tensor results in the modication of the conformal weights
and modes of the fermionic elds. therefore there are no spectral ows converting the half-integer modes of the neveu-
schwarz generators into the integer modes of the topological generators, as sometimes confused in the literature (the
spectral ows do not modify the conformal weights).

2.2 topological verma modules

highest weight vectors

in a given representation of the topological n=2 algebra, the primary states, i.e. the states with
lowest conformal weight denoted traditionally as highest weight vectors, require to be annihilated
by all the positive modes of the generators (the lowering operators). therefore the h.w. conditions
can be dened unambiguously as the vanishing conditions: ln1|i = hn1|i = gn1|i =
qn1|i = 0 .

the zero modes g0 and q0 provide the brst-invariance properties of the topological states in
the sense that a state annihilated by q0 is brst-invariant while a state annihilated by g0 can be
regarded as anti-brst-invariant. the states annihilated by both g0 and q0 are called chiral [6],
generalizing the fact that the chiral and antichiral primaries3 of the neveu-schwarz n=2 algebra
are transformed, under the topological twists (2.1), into topological primaries annihilated by both
g0 and q0: (g
1/2)  (g0, q0). in what follows the states annihilated by q0 but not by g0
will be called q0-closed whereas the states annihilated by g0 but not by q0 will be called g0-closed.

1/2, g

from the anticommutator {q0, g0} = 2l0 one deduces [12] that a topological state (primary
or secondary) with non-zero conformal weight  can be either g0-closed, or q0-closed, or a linear
combination of both types:

|i =

q0g0|i +

g0q0|i .

(2.3)

one deduces also that q0-closed (g0-closed) topological states with non-zero conformal weight
are q0-exact (g0-exact) as well. the topological states with zero conformal weight, however, can be
q0-closed (satisfying q0g0|iq = 0), or g0-closed (satisfying g0q0|ig = 0), or chiral, or no-label
(not decomposible into g0-closed, q0-closed and chiral states, satisfying q0g0|i = g0q0|i 6= 0).

hence one can distinguish three dierent types of topological primaries giving rise to complete
verma modules (provided they do not satisfy additional constraints): g0-closed primaries |, hig,
q0-closed primaries |, hiq, and no-label primaries |0, hi. we will not consider primaries |, hi
which are linear combinations of two or more of these types. chiral primaries |0, hig,q give rise
to incomplete verma modules because the chirality constraint on the primary state is not required
(just allowed) by the algebra.

(g0-closed), |i(q)q

l

as to the topological secondary states, in particular singular vectors, they are labelled in addi-
tion by the level l and the relative charge q. hence the topological secondary states are denoted
as |i(q)g
(no-label). it is convenient
also to indicate the conformal weight , the charge h, and the brst-invariance properties of the
primary state on which the secondary is built. notice that the conformal weight and the total u(1)
charge of the secondary states are given by  + l and h + q, respectively.

(q0-closed), |i(q)g,q

(chiral), and |i(q)

now we will give a rst description of the dierent kinds of complete verma modules as well as

of the chiral verma modules.

3chiral primary states of the n=2 superconformal algebras, which were introduced in ref.

[25], are of special

relevance in physics (see also refs. [6] and [14]).

generic verma modules

the verma modules built on g0-closed or q0-closed primary states without additional con-
straints are called generic verma modules [12][18]. they are complete in the sense that the con-
straints on the primaries of being annihilated either by g0 or by q0 are required by the algebra, as
we have just discussed. furthermore for non-zero conformal weight  6= 0 the h.w. vector of any
generic verma module is degenerate, i.e. there are two primary states. the reason is that the action
of q0 on |, hig produces another primary state: q0|, hig = |, h  1iq, and the action of g0
on |, h  1iq brings the state back to |, hig (up to a constant): g0|, h  1iq = 2|, hig.
for  = 0, however, q0|0, hig is not a primary state but a level-zero chiral singular vector in-
stead, denoted as |i(1)g,q
0,|0,h1iq.
as a consequence, the h.w. vectors |0, hig and |0, h  1iq are located in dierent verma mod-
ules v (|0, hig) and v (|0, h  1iq), whereas for  6= 0 the verma modules built on |, hig and
|, h  1iq coincide: v (|, hig) = v (|, h  1iq) i  6= 0.

0,|0,hig , and similarly g0|0, h  1iq is the chiral singular vector |i(1)g,q

no-label verma modules

the verma modules built on no-label primary states are called no-label verma modules v (|0, hi)
[12][18]. they are complete, obviously, as the no-label primaries are annihilated only by the positive
modes of the generators of the algebra. the action of g0 and q0 on |0, hi produce the charged
singular vectors g0|0, hi = |i(1)g
0,|0,hi, which cannot come back to |0, hi
as the action of q0 and g0, respectively, produces an uncharged chiral singular vector instead:
q0g0|0, hi = g0q0|0, hi = |i(0)g,q
0,|0,hi . (as a matter of fact, one deduces that g0|0, hi and q0|0, hi
are singular vectors taking into account that g0q0|0, hi is a singular vector). the level-zero states in
a no-label verma module consist therefore of the primary state |0, hi plus the two charged singular
vectors g0|0, hi and q0|0, hi, and the uncharged chiral singular vector q0g0|0, hi.

0,|0,hi and q0|0, hi = |i(1)q

chiral verma modules

the verma modules built on chiral primary states are called chiral verma modules v (|0, hig,q)
[13][12][18]. they are not complete because the primary state being annihilated by both g0 and
q0 amounts to an additional constraint not required (just allowed) by the algebra. chiral verma
modules result from the quotient of generic verma modules, with  = 0, by the submodules
generated by the level-zero singular vectors. that is, a chiral verma module can be expressed
as the quotient v (|0, hig,q) = v (|0, hig)/q0|0, hig and also can be expressed as the quotient
v (|0, hig,q) = v (|0, hiq)/g0|0, hiq , equivalently. therefore it can be regarded as a complete
verma module with a piece cut o. the level-zero states in a chiral verma module consist of only
the primary state |0, hig,q, obviously.

2.3 topological singular vectors

the topological singular vectors can be classied in 29 dierent types in complete verma mod-
ules and 4 dierent types in chiral verma modules, distinguished by the relative charge q and the

6

brst-invariance properties of the singular vectors and of the primaries on which they are built
[12][18]. an important question is whether the singular vectors with non-zero conformal weight,
 + l 6= 0, are linear combinations of g0-closed and q0-closed singular vectors. from the anticom-
mutator {q0, g0} = 2l0 one obtains the decomposition

|il =

1

2( + l)

g0q0 |il +

1

2( + l)

q0g0 |il = |ig

l + |iq

l

.

(2.4)

if |il is a singular vector, i.e. satises the h.w. conditions ln1|i = hn1|i = gn1|i =
qn1|i = 0 , then g0q0|il and q0g0|il satisfy the h.w. conditions too, as one deduces straight-
forwardly using the algebra (2.2). therefore, regarding singular vectors with non-zero conformal
weight, we can restrict ourselves to g0-closed and to q0-closed singular vectors. the singular
vectors with zero conformal weight,  + l = 0, can also be chiral or no-label.

in what follows we will see how the dierent types of singular vectors are distributed in the
generic, no-label and chiral verma modules. then we will discuss the action of the fermionic zero
modes g0 and q0 on the singular vectors.

generic verma modules

the possible existing types of topological singular vectors in generic verma modules are the

following [12][18] :

- ten types built on g0-closed primaries |, hig:

q = 2

q = 1

q = 0

q = 1

l

l

|i(2)g






(2.5)

(2.6)

with l =  in the case of chiral and no-label singular vectors. the maximal dimensions of
the corresponding singular vector spaces [18] are two, for the singular vectors of types |i(0)g
l,|,hig ,

7

|i(1)q

l,|,hiq and |i(1)g

l,|,hiq , and one for the remaining types4.

l,|,hig , |i(0)q
for  6= 0 the singular vectors of table (2.5) are equivalent to singular vectors of table (2.6) with
a shift on the u(1) charges due to the existence of two primary states in the verma module: one
g0-closed primary |, hig and one q0-closed primary |, h  1iq, as was discussed in subsection
2.2. in particular, the charged (uncharged) chiral singular vectors of table (2.5) are equivalent to
uncharged (charged) chiral singular vectors of table (2.6).

l

l

l,|,hig , |i(0)q

l,|,hig , |i(0)g

l

l,|,hiq and |i(1)q

an useful observation is that chiral singular vectors |i(q)g,q

can be regarded as particular
cases of g0-closed singular vectors |i(q)g
and/or as particular cases of q0-closed singular vectors
|i(q)q
. that is, some g0-closed and q0-closed singular vectors become chiral when the conformal
weight of the singular vector turns out to be zero, i.e.  + l = 0. this is always the case for singular
vectors of types |i(1)g
l,|,hiq , as explained in refs. [19][18] (see
below), while this never occurs to singular vectors of types |i(1)g
l,|,hiq and
|i(2)g

l,|,hiq , as there are no chiral singular vectors of the corresponding types.
all topological singular vectors in tables (2.5) and (2.6) can be organized into families [12]
involving dierent verma modules and dierent levels, every member of a family being mapped
to any other member by the topological spectral ows [21][22] and/or the fermionic zero modes g0
and q0. these families follow innite many dierent patterns. furthermore, with the exception of
the no-label singular vectors, all other 16 types of topological singular vectors in tables (2.5) and
(2.6) can be easily mapped to the singular vectors of the ns algebra [19]. as a bonus one obtains
construction formulae for the 16 types of topological singular vectors using the construction formulae
for the ns singular vectors given in refs. [15][16].

the possible existing types of topological singular vectors in no-label verma modules are the

following nine types [12][18] built on no-label primaries |0, hi:

that the chiral type of singular vector only exists for level zero. it is given by |i(0)g,q
0,|0,hi = g0q0|0, hi.
4the maximal dimension n for a given singular vector space puts a theoretical limit on the number of linearly
independent singular vectors of the corresponding type that one can write down at the same level in a given verma
module [18]. for the singular vectors given in tables (2.5) and (2.6) the corresponding maximal dimensions have been
veried by the low level computations.

5at levels 1 and 2 there are no 3-dimensional singular spaces (there are 2-dimensional ones though). further

computations are needed to decide whether or not they actually exist at higher levels.

these singular vectors can also be organized into families [12] resulting in two dierent kinds of
families with a unique pattern each: the box diagram consisting of four singular vectors connected
by g0, q0 and the universal odd spectral ow automorphism6 a.

chiral verma modules

the possible existing types of topological singular vectors in chiral verma modules are the

following four types [12][18] built on chiral primaries |0, hig,q:

q = 1

q = 0

q = 1

g0-closed 
q0-closed

l

l

|i(0)g
|i(0)q

|i(1)g


(2.8)

this result was to be expected since a chiral verma module v (|0, hig,q) can be viewed as a verma
module v (|0, hig) , built on a g0-closed primary, with a piece cut o, but it can also be viewed
as a verma module v (|0, hiq) , built on a q0-closed primary, with a piece cut o. therefore one
might think that the only possible singular vectors in chiral verma modules should correspond to the
types existing in both table (2.5), built on g0-closed primaries, and table (2.6), built on q0-closed
primaries, whereas the non-common types must be projected out belonging to the submodules that
are set to zero.
inspecting tables (2.5) and (2.6) one nds that the common types of singular
vectors are precisely the ones given in table (2.8) plus chiral and no-label singular vectors which
cannot possibly exist in chiral verma modules (one cannot construct chiral or no-label descendant
states on a chiral primary because they would require level zero but g0 and q0 annihilate the
primary). the reasoning we just made is not completely correct in spite of its apparent success,
however, because in the generic verma modules v (|0, hig) and v (|0, hiq) there exist subsingular
vectors which become singular only in the chiral verma module, i.e. after setting to zero the null
submodules generated by the level-zero singular vectors [13][12]. nevertheless the resulting types
of new singular vectors which are only singular in the chiral verma modules are again of the types
shown in table (2.8).

the maximal dimension of the corresponding singular vector spaces is one [18]. these singular
vectors can also be organized into families [13][12] with a unique pattern: the box diagram consisting
of four singular vectors, one of each type, connected by g0, q0 and the spectral ow automorphism
a (see footnote 6).

6the topological odd spectral ow for  = 1, denoted simply as a [21][22], acting as lm  lm  mhm, hm 
c
3 , gn  qn and qn  gn, is an involutive automorphism, i.e. a1 = a. it is universal in the sense that
hm 
it transforms every primary state and every singular vector back into another primary state and another singular
vector. in particular it is the only spectral ow operator that maps chiral states to chiral states and no-label states
to no-label states. hence any other spectral ow operators (except the identity) destroy chiral verma modules as
well as no-label verma modules.

the fermionic zero modes

most topological singular vectors come in pairs at the same level in the same verma module,
diering by one unit of relative charge and by the brst-invariance properties. the reason is that
the fermionic zero modes g0 and q0 acting on a singular vector produce another singular vector,
as can be checked straightforwardly using the algebra (2.2). therefore, at least in principle, only
chiral singular vectors can be alone, whereas the no-label singular vectors are accompanied by
three, rather than one, singular vectors at the same level in the same verma module. to be precise,
inside a given verma module v (, h) and for a given level l the topological singular vectors with
non-zero conformal weight are connected by the action of q0 and g0 as:

q0 |i(q)g

l  |i(q1)q

l

,

g0 |i(q)q

l  |i(q+1)g

l

,

(2.9)

where the arrows can be reversed (up to constants), using g0 and q0 respectively, since the confor-
mal weight of the singular vectors is dierent from zero, i.e. +l 6= 0. otherwise, on the right-hand
side of the arrows one obtains chiral secondary singular vectors which cannot come back to the
singular vectors on the left-hand side:

q0 |i(q)g

l=  |i(q1)g,q

l=

,

g0 |i(q)q

l=  |i(q+1)g,q

l=

.

(2.10)

observe that the non-existence of chiral singular vectors of types |i(2)g,q

l,|,hig , |i(2)g,q
l,|,hiq
and |i(1)g,q
l,|,hiq , as one can see in tables (2.5) and (2.6), implies in turn the absence of singular vec-
tors of types |i(1)g
l,|,hiq , for  + l = 0. therefore for zero
conformal weight these types of singular vectors do not exist as such but they always become
chiral, i.e. of types |i(1)g,q

l,|,hiq and |i(1)q

l,|,hig , |i(1)g,q

l,|,hig , |i(0)g,q

l,|,hig , |i(0)g,q

l,|,hiq and |i(1)g,q

l,|,hig , |i(0)q

l,|,hig , |i(0)g

l,|,hiq , instead.

regarding no-label singular vectors |i(q)

l

, they always satisfy  + l = 0. the action of g0 and

q0 on a no-label singular vector produce three singular vectors:

q0 |i(q)

l=  |i(q1)q

l= , g0 |i(q)

l=  |i(q+1)g

l= , g0 q0 |i(q)

l=  |i(q)g,q
l= .

(2.11)

all three are secondary singular vectors which cannot come back to the no-label singular vector
|i(q)
l= by acting with g0 and q0, the chiral singular vector being in addition secondary with
respect to the g0-closed and the q0-closed singular vectors.

summarizing, g0 and q0 interpolate between two singular vectors with non-zero conformal
weight, in both directions, whereas they produce secondary singular vectors when acting on singular
vectors with zero conformal weight.

3 determinant formulae

in what follows we will write down the determinant formulae for the topological n=2 algebra
and we will analyse in much detail the interpretation of the roots of the determinants in terms of
singular vectors, making use of the results discussed in the last section. we will also investigate
the dierent types of submodules, regarding shape and size, which appear in the verma modules.

10

we will start with the generic verma modules, then we will review the results for the chiral verma
modules [13], adding new insights, and nally we will consider the no-label verma modules. the
results obtained will be transferred straightforwardly to the verma modules of the ramond n=2
algebra (which have been very poorly studied in the literature) as these turn out to be isomorphic
to the verma modules of the topological n=2 algebra.

3.1 generic verma modules

for all the generic verma modules  either with two h.w. vectors |, hig and |, h  1iq

( 6= 0) or with only one h.w. vector |0, hig or |0, h  1iq  the determinant formula reads

it is easy to check, by counting of states, that the partitions 2p (l  rs

2 ), exponents of fr,s in the
determinant formula, correspond to complete verma submodules whereas 2pk(l  k), exponents of
g
k in the determinant formula, correspond to incomplete verma submodules. furthermore, as we
will see, taking into account the size and the shape one can distinguish four types of submodules.
the fact that p (0) = pk(0) = 1 indicates that the singular vectors come two by two at the same
level, in the same verma module.

the roots of the quadratic vanishing surface fr,s(, h, t) = 0 and of the vanishing planes
g
k (, h, t) = 0 are related to the corresponding roots of the determinant formula for the neveu-
schwarz n=2 algebra [9][10][11] via the topological twists (2.1). these transform the standard h.w.
vectors of the neveu-schwarz n=2 algebra into g0-closed h.w. vectors of the topological n=2 al-
gebra, as we discussed in subsection 2.1 (see refs. [13][12] for a detailed account of the twisting and
untwisting of primary states and singular vectors). the exponents p (l  rs
2 ) and pk(l  k) cannot
be obtained (easily) from the exponents corresponding to the determinants of the neveu-schwarz
n=2 algebra due to the complicated deformations produced by the topological twists (2.1) on the
neveu-schwarz verma modules. however, these exponents essentially coincide with the exponents
corresponding to the determinants of the ramond n=2 algebra, as we will deduce in subsection
3.4.

the interpretation of the roots of fr,s(, h, t) = 0 and g

k (, h, t) = 0 in terms of the singular

vectors that one encounters in the corresponding verma modules is as follows.

(3.4), the verma module built on the g0-closed h.w. vector |r,s, hig
has generically one uncharged singular vector of type |i(0)g
and one charged singular vector of
type |i(1)q
in the general case r,s 6= l , g0 and q0 interpolate between
these two singular vectors (up to constants), so that they are on the same footing, i.e. the h.w.
vector of the null submodule is degenerate. in the case r,s = l, however, the singular vectors
have zero conformal weight and the action of g0 or q0 on such singular vectors produces chiral
secondary singular vectors which cannot come back to the primitive singular vector by acting with
g0 and q0, as was explained in subsection 2.3. as a result, in the case r,s = l the generic
situation is that only one of the two singular vectors |i(0)g
is the h.w. vector of the
null submodule, the other becoming a chiral secondary singular vector (i.e. of type |i(0)g,q
or
and |i(1)q
|i(1)g,q
become chiral and thus disconnected from each other, both vectors being the h.w. vectors of two
dierent (although overlapping) null submodules. in appendix a we have deduced the values of
h and t corresponding to the verma modules with r,s = l for the three dierent possibilities:
|i(0)g
becoming chiral, and both of them becoming chiral. in the rst

for

it is important to distinguish between the following two possibilities: r,s 6= 0 and r,s = 0, as
shown in table (3.11), fig. i and fig. ii. in the rst case there is a degeneracy of the ground states,
so that the verma module built on |r,s, hig has also a q0-closed h.w. vector |r,s, h  1iq, g0
and q0 interpolating between them. as a result, one can choose to express the descendant states
in the verma module as built on |r,s, hig or as built on |r,s, h  1iq (with a corresponding
rearrangement of the relative charges). consequently, the singular vectors of type |i(1)q
l, |, hig are
equivalent to singular vectors of type |i(0)q
l, |, h1iq, and one can view the pair of singular vectors
for r,s 6= 0 at level l = rs
l, |, hig in the g-sector and
|i(0)q
l, |, h1iq in the q-sector (one of them, or both, becoming chiral for the case r,s = l), in
analogy with the (+) and () sectors of the ramond algebra.

for r,s = 0 there are two sets of solutions for h = hr,s that annihilate the determinants: hr,s =

h
and the verma modules built on the h.w. vectors |0, hr,s  1iq are dierent because g0|0, hr,s  1iq
and q0|0, hr,sig are level-zero chiral charged singular vectors (corresponding to g
0 (, h, t) = 0, see
below) which cannot be interchanged by the h.w. vectors |0, hr,sig and |0, hr,s  1iq, respectively.
consequently, in these verma modules the descendant states cannot be expressed in two ways (with
the exception of the states inside the null submodules generated by the level-zero singular vectors).

over the two h.w. vectors of the verma module, the singular vector on the vertical over the g0-closed (q0-closed) h.w.
vector being g0-closed (q0-closed) itself. therefore the two singular vectors can be appropriately described as two
uncharged singular vectors, one in the g-sector and the other in the q-sector. (for r,s = l one, at least, of the two
singular vectors becomes chiral and consequently the two horizontal arrows, corresponding to g0 and q0, reduce to one
single arrow, or to no arrow at all if both singular vectors become chiral and thus disconnected). for zero conformal
weight  = r,s = 0, however, there is only one h.w. vector in the verma module and there is one singular vector at
level zero. for the verma modules with h.w. vectors |0, hr,sig, for the case hr,s = h(0)
r,s the singular vectors at level l
are located outside the submodule generated by the level zero singular vector q0|0, h(0)
r,s ig. therefore they can only be
expressed as type |i(0)g
r,s ig. for the case hr,s = hr,s,
however, the singular vectors at level l are located inside the submodule generated by q0|0, hr,sig. therefore they
can either be expressed as type |i(0)g
descendant states of the h.w. vector |0, hr,sig, or they can
be expressed as secondary singular vectors built on the primitive singular vector q0|0, hr,sig.

no-label singular vectors

apart from the singular vectors that we have analysed, detected by the determinant formula,
there may still exist other primitive singular vectors, besides subsingular vectors, hidden by the rst
ones. such singular vectors, denoted as isolated, have not been investigated properly for any n=2
superconformal algebra. furthermore, it can even happen that some singular vectors predicted by
the determinant formula are secondary with respect to an isolated overlooked singular vector at
the same level, the latter being the generator of the detected singular vectors, by acting on it with
some zero modes of the algebra.

r

, corresponding to t = 2

in the case of the n=2 superconformal algebras subsingular vectors have been discovered and
partially analysed in refs.
[13][12][17][20]. as to the invisible isolated singular vectors, in the
topological algebra (as well as in the ramond algebra) there are certainly such singular vectors, at
least the ones which are in addition generators of visible secondary singular vectors detected by
the determinant formula. namely, all the no-label singular vectors in generic verma modules, given
in tables (2.5) and (2.6), belong to such category. no-label singular vectors, written down at levels
1 and 2 in refs. [12] and [17], are very scarce as they only exist for specic values of c. as deduced
in appendix a, these values are c = 3r6
r . the reason why no-label
singular vectors are undetected by the determinant formula is that they only appear in certain
verma modules, for discrete values of , h, t, where there are intersections, at the same level l, of
singular vectors corresponding to the series fr,s(, h, t) = 0 with singular vectors corresponding to
one of the series g
2 = k = l and  = l (see appendix a for the details).
to be precise, as was explained in section 2, no-label singular vectors generate three secondary
singular vectors at the same level, just by the action of g0 and q0, which cannot come back to the
no-label singular vector (see fig. v). it happens that one of these singular vectors corresponds to
the series fr,s(, h, t) = 0, another one corresponds to the series g
k (, h, t) = 0, and the remaining
one corresponds to both series. for example, in the case of an uncharged no-label singular vector
= q0|i(0)
|i(0)
and |i(0)g,q
(see fig. v), whereas in the case of a charged no-label
= g0|i(1)
singular vector |i(1)
,
l
= q0|i(1)
|i(2)q
. in appendix a we show the no-label singular
vector |i(0)
1 , at level 1, built on the g0-closed h.w. vector |1, hig together with the three secondary
singular vectors at level 1: |i(1)g

l = g0q0|i(0)
the three secondary singular vectors are of the types: |i(0)g

the three secondary singular vectors are of the types: |i(1)g

k (, h, t) = 0, with rs

types of submodules

now let us identify the dierent types of submodules that one nds in the generic verma
modules built on the h.w. vectors |, hig and/or |, h  1iq. we will take into account the
size of the submodules as well as their shape at the bottom. the singular vectors corresponding
to the series fr,s(, h, t) = 0 belong to two dierent types of submodules, as shown in fig. vi,
with the same partition functions p (l  rs
2 ) corresponding to complete verma submodules, but
with drastically dierent shapes at the bottom of the submodules. in the most general case the
bottom of the submodule consists of two singular vectors connected by one or two horizontal arrows
corresponding to q0 and/or g0 (only one arrow if one of the singular vectors is chiral). however, it
can also happen that the two singular vectors at the bottom of the submodule are chiral both, and
therefore disconnected from each other. an important observation is that a given verma submodule
may not be completely generated by the singular vectors at the bottom. these could generate the
submodule only partially, in which case one or more subsingular vectors generate the missing parts.

submodules are connected by g0 and/or q0, depending on whether  6= l or  = l, t 6=  s
which one of the singular vectors is chiral). in the second type, corresponding to  = l, t =  s
two singular vectors are chiral and therefore disconnected from each other.

the singular vectors corresponding to the series g

k (, h, t) = 0 belong to only one type of
submodule, as shown in fig. vii, with partition functions pk(l  k) corresponding to incomplete
verma submodules. the two singular vectors at the bottom of the submodule are always connected
by g0 and/or q0 since at most one of these singular vectors can be chiral. finally, the no-label
singular vectors generate their own no-label submodules. as shown in fig. vii, at the bottom of
the no-label submodule one nds four singular vectors: the primitive no-label singular vector and
the three secondary singular vectors generated by acting on this one with q0 and g0. no-label
submodules are therefore much wider than the other types of submodules.

fig. vii

. the singular vectors corresponding to the series g

k (, h, t) = 0 belong to only one type of submodules
(incomplete verma submodules). the two singular vectors at the bottom of the submodules are connected by g0
and/or q0, depending on whether  6= l or  = l. the no-label singular vectors generate the widest submodules
with four singular vectors at the bottom.

we see therefore that there are four dierent types of submodules that may appear in generic
verma modules, distinguished by their size and/or the shape at the bottom of the submodule7. a
more accurate classication of the submodules should take into account also the shape of the whole
submodule, including the possible existence of subsingular vectors [28].

3.2 chiral verma modules

chiral verma modules v (|0, hig,q) result from the quotient of generic verma modules of types
v (|0, hiq) and v (|0, hig), by the submodules generated by the level-zero singular vectors g0|0, hiq
and q0|0, hig, respectively. therefore there are two possible origins for the singular vectors in
chiral verma modules, as shown in fig. viii: they are either the surviving singular vectors in
v (|0, hig) or v (|0, hiq) which do not belong to the submodules set to zero, or they appear when
subsingular vectors in v (|0, hig) or v (|0, hiq) are converted into singular vectors in v (|0, hig,q)
as a consequence of the quotient procedure8. in the rst case one deduces straightforwardly, from

7in the literature there are claims (without proofs) that there are only two dierent types of submodules in generic
(standard) verma modules of the topological n=2 algebra. in particular, the chiral-chiral submodules on the right
of fig. vi and the no-label submodules on the right of fig. vii do not t into that classication.

8we stress the fact that these two are the only possible origins for the singular vectors in chiral verma modules (by

the results of tables (2.5) and (2.6), that the only possible types of such surviving singular vectors
. in the second case,
are the four types shown in table (2.8):
when the singular vectors in chiral verma modules originate from subsingular vectors, one cannot
deduce their possible types from tables (2.5) and (2.6). however, we know that the only possible
types of such singular vectors are again the four types given in table (2.8) since we have proved, in
ref. [18], that the space associated to any other type of would-be singular vector in chiral verma
modules has maximal dimension zero (i.e. no singular vectors of such types exist). observe that in
chiral verma modules there are no chiral neither no-label singular vectors. as a consequence the
action of either g0 or q0 on a singular vector produces always another singular vector. as a result
the singular vectors in chiral verma modules come always two by two at the same level in the same
verma module, g0 and q0 interpolating between them.

. when the singular vector q0|0, hig is set to zero, the generic verma module v (|0, hig) built on the h.w.
fig. viii
vector |0, hig is divided by the submodule v (q0|0, hig). as a consequence, the g0-closed h.w. vector |0, hig becomes
the chiral h.w. vector |0, hig,q and the resulting verma module is an incomplete, chiral verma module v (|0, hig,q).
the singular vectors in the generic verma module that are not located inside the submodule v (q0|0, hig) remain after
the quotient procedure, they are the surviving singular vectors. but it can also happen that there are subsingular
vectors outside the submodule v (q0|0, hig), but descending to it by acting with the generators of the algebra. these
subsingular vectors become singular in the resulting chiral verma module v (|0, hig,q).

the determinant formulae for chiral verma modules of the topological, neveu-schwarz and
ramond n=2 superconformal algebras were written down in ref.
[13]. they were deduced from
the determinant formulae for the complete generic verma modules by imposing the ansatz that the
roots of the determinants are the same in both cases (for the values of the conformal weights 
corresponding to the chiral verma modules). although no rigorous proofs were presented for this
ansatz, the corresponding expressions were checked until level 4. for the case of the topological
algebra the chiral determinant formula is given as function of the u(1) charges h as the topological
chiral verma modules have zero conformal weight  = 0. it reads

denition of subsingular vectors). the failure to see this has lead to very confusing statements in the literature where

vectors in the generic verma modules.

(3.18)

therefore they correspond to incomplete verma submodules, as we pointed out before. the factors
2 in the exponents of the determinants (3.15) show explicitly again that the singular vectors come
two by two at the same level in the same verma module, as pr(0) = 1. one can also see in the
(0)
determinant formula (3.15) that the singular vectors corresponding to h = h
r,s and the singular
(1)
vectors corresponding to h = h
r,s both belong to the same types of submodules (incomplete verma
submodules as the chiral verma modules where they are embedded).

the interpretation of the roots of the determinants in terms of singular vectors is much simpler
than for generic verma modules. first, in chiral verma modules there is only one h.w. vector and
therefore only one way to express the singular vectors. second, in chiral verma modules there are
no chiral singular vectors neither no-label singular vectors. the interpretation of the roots is as
follows, as shown in fig. ix.

now let us analyse the origin of the dierent singular vectors in the chiral verma modules
(1)
r,s ig,q) with respect to the singular and subsingular vectors in the
v (|0, h
generic verma modules.
in other words, let us investigate which of the singular vectors in the
generic verma modules are lost in the quotient, which are not quotiented out, resulting in singular
vectors in the chiral verma modules, and which are new singular vectors in the chiral verma
modules that were not singular in the generic verma modules but subsingular, as a consequence.
for this purpose we will consider the two possible quotients which give rise to the same chiral verma
module, i.e. v (|0, hig,q) = v (|0, hig)/v (q0|0, hig) and v (|0, hig,q) = v (|0, hiq)/v (g0|0, hiq).

let us start with the realization of the chiral verma modules as the quotient v (|0, hig,q) =
v (|0, hig)/v (q0|0, hig). as was discussed in the last subsection, setting  = 0 in the determi-
nant formula (3.1) one nds the generic verma modules of type v (|0, hig which contain singular
(0)
r,s and h = hr,s, eqns.
vectors as follows. from fr,s(0, h, t 6= 0) = 0 one gets the solutions h = h
(3.5) and (3.6), whereas from fr,s(0, h, t = 0) = 0 one obtains h =  s
2 . for all these solutions
the corresponding singular vectors are pairs of types |i(0)g
2 . from
k (0, h, t) = 0 one gets the solution h = h+
g+
k , eqn. (3.9), the corresponding singular vectors being
pairs of types |i(1)g
k (0, h, t) = 0 one obtains h = h
k ,
eqn. (3.9), the corresponding singular vectors being pairs of types |i(1)g
at level
l = k. after the quotient v (|0, hig)/v (q0|0, hig) is performed, by setting q0|0, hig  0, one
obtains the chiral verma modules v (|0, hig,q) which contain singular vectors only for h = h(0)
r,s and
r,s , eqns. (3.5) and (3.17), the corresponding singular vectors being pairs of types |i(0)g
(1)
,
h = h
and |i(1)g
|i(1)q
2 . a simple analysis of these facts, taking
into account that h+

after the quotient v (|0, hiq)/v (g0|0, hiq) is performed, by setting g0|0, hiq  0, one obtains as
in the previous case the chiral verma modules v (|0, hig,q) which contain singular vectors only for

an interesting observation now [12] is that two series of singular vectors in chiral verma modules
correspond to both singular vectors and subsingular vectors depending on the specic generic
and |i(1)q
verma modules. namely, the singular vectors of types |i(0)g
in the chiral verma
(0)

modules v (|0, h
in v (|0, h(0)
in the

r,s ig,q) correspond to singular vectors in v (|0, hr,s  1iq) but to
chiral verma modules v (|0, h
subsingular vectors in v (|0, hr,sig) for s > 2. these subsingular vectors do not have, a priori, well
dened brst-invariance properties, but become g0-closed or q0-closed when they become singular.
let us note that this symmetry between singular/subsingular vectors in the g0-closed/q0-closed
verma modules v (|0, hig) and v (|0, h  1iq) is broken for the neveu-schwarz n=2 algebra since
the q0-closed topological h.w. vectors do not correspond to h.w. vectors (but secondary states)
of that algebra, as explained in subsection 2.1, and consequently there is no ns counterpart for
the q0-closed verma modules v (|0, h  1iq). (for  6= 0 there is ns counterpart for the verma
modules v (|, h  1iq), however, because they coincide with the verma modules v (|, hig), as
explained in subsection 2.2).

3.3 no-label verma modules

no-label verma modules v (|0, hi) built on no-label h.w. vectors appear as submodules in some
generic verma modules for t = 2
). they have a counterpart in the ramond n=2 algebra
 no-helicity verma modules  as we will see in next subsection. however, they do not have a
counterpart in the neveu-schwarz n=2 algebra as the ns counterpart of no-label h.w. vectors are
non-h.w. ns vectors. in fact, the no-label singular vectors in generic verma modules correspond
to ns subsingular vectors, as was proved in ref. [17].

r (c = 3r6

r

in principle, we could dene no-label verma modules also for  6= 0.

in this case, how-
ever, the no-label h.w. vector |, hi can be decomposed into a g0-closed h.w. vector and a
q0-closed h.w. vector so that v (|, hi) is simply a direct sum of the generic verma module built
on g0|, hi = |, h + 1ig and the generic verma module built on q0|, hi = |, h  1iq. there-
fore, the corresponding determinant formula for  6= 0 is simply the product of the two generic
determinant formulae and its study does not lead to anything more than what we have found for
the generic verma modules.

for the only interesting no-label case, i.e. for  = 0, the no-label verma module is no longer a
direct sum of two generic verma modules, however. in fact, the level-zero vectors g0|0, hi, q0|0, hi,
and g0q0|0, hi become singular for  = 0 and therefore the no-label determinant formula for  = 0
vanishes for all levels. nevertheless, we can still use the roots of the determinants of the no-label
verma modules in the neighbourhood of  = 0 in order to nd the singular vectors for no-label
verma modules with  = 0. for this purpose we take the product of the determinant formulae
for the generic verma modules v (|, h + 1ig) and v (|, h  1iq) and factorise their roots in the
limit   0. the terms that vanish in this limit we combine in a factor  ( = 0) = 0 which is
responsible for the fact that the no-label determinant vanishes at each level. taking into account
the terms that do not vanish in this limit one nally nds the following expression

det(mt nl

(3.5), (3.17), (3.6) and (3.9). the partition
with h
functions p and pk are dened in eqn. (3.10). as was explained in subsection 3.1, the partitions
2p (l  rs
2 ) correspond to complete verma submodules of generic type, whereas the partitions
2pk(l  k) correspond to incomplete verma submodules. once again we see that the singular
vectors come two by two at the same level, in the same verma module, as p (0) = pk(0) = 1.

the factor  ( = 0) = 0 indicates that the determinant always vanishes for any value of h,
as happens for the generic verma modules with  = 0 (with one singular vector at level zero).
similarly as in that case, the other roots of the determinants identify the no-label verma modules
with singular vectors other than the ones at level zero (which is an important information in order
to study embedding patterns). like for chiral verma modules, in no-label verma modules there are

26

no chiral singular vectors nor no-label singular vectors. the interpretation of the roots in terms of

no-label verma modules

fig. x the no-label verma module built on the no-label h.w. vector |0, hi has three singular vectors at level zero:
|0, h + 1ig = g0|0, hi, |0, h  1iq = q0|0, hi and |0, hig,q = g0q0|0, hi. the submodules generated by |0, h + 1ig
and |0, h  1iq are generic verma modules intersecting in the chiral verma module built on |0, hig,q.

one important remark is that all the singular vectors detected by the determinant formula
(3.19), that belong to the series that we have just described, are located inside the submodules
generated by the level zero singular vectors g0|0, hi, q0|0, hi and g0q0|0, hi. there must exist,
however, singular or subsingular vectors outside these submodules. the reason is that after di-
viding the no-label verma module by these submodules a chiral verma module is left with the
(1)
corresponding singular vectors for h = h
r,s , as discussed in subsection 3.2. our con-
jecture is that outside the submodules built on the level zero singular vectors there are generically
only subsingular vectors, which are singular just for some discrete values of t (i.e. of c). at level 1
this is the case for t = 2 (c = 9), as one can see in appendix b, and at level 2 this is the case for
t = 1 (c = 6), t = 2 (c = 9) and t = 2 (c = 3).

3.4 verma modules and singular vectors of the ramond n=2 algebra

the determinant formula for the standard verma modules of the ramond n=2 superconformal
in spite of this, the verma modules and
algebra was computed in the middle eighties [9][11].
singular vectors of the ramond n=2 algebra have not been given much attention in the literature
so far (see however refs. [26], [17] and [18]). more recently the determinant formula for the chiral
verma modules (built on the ramond ground states) has been computed in ref. [13]. as a bonus,
subsingular vectors were discovered for this algebra. our purpose now is to show that the verma
modules of the ramond n=2 algebra are isomorphic to the verma modules of the topological n=2
algebra.
in particular one can construct a one-to-one mapping between every ramond singular
vector and every topological singular vector at the same levels and with the same relative charges.
as a consequence all the results we have obtained in this section for the topological n=2 algebra,
summarized in the four tables (3.11)  (3.14), and the ten gures fig. i  fig. x, can be transferred

28

straightforwardly to the ramond n=2 algebra.

to start let us say a few words about the ramond n=2 superconformal algebra given by [1],

[23], [26]

= (m  n)lm+n + c

12 (m3  m)m+n,0 ,

4 )r+s,0 ,

0 -closed or g

where all the generators, bosonic ln, hn, and fermionic g
r , are integer-moded. the fermionic zero
modes characterize the states as being g+
0 } =
2l0  c
12 shows. we will denote these states as helicity-(+) and helicity-() states. however, for
the conformal weight  = c
0 (we will call
them chiral), and there also exist indecomposable no-helicity states which cannot be expressed as
linear combinations of helicity-(+), helicity-() and chiral states. these no-helicity states, singular
vectors in particular, have been reported very recently for the rst time in ref. [17], and they were
completely overlooked in the early literature.

24 the ground states are annihilated by both g+

0 -closed, as the anticommutator {g+

0 and g

0 , g

we already see that the case  = c

24 for the ramond n=2 algebra is the equivalent to the case
 = 0 for the topological n=2 algebra. furthermore, the helicity-(+) and helicity-() r states
are analogous to the g0-closed (g) and q0-closed (q) topological states, and the chiral (+) and
no-helicity r states are analogous to the chiral (g, q) and no-label topological states, respectively.

in order to simplify the analysis that follows we will dene the u(1) charge for the states of the
ramond n=2 algebra in the same way as for the states of the topological and neveu-schwarz n=2
algebras. namely, the u(1) charge of the states will be denoted by h (instead of h  1
2 , as was the
standard notation in the past [9]), and the relative charge q of a secondary state will be dened
as the dierence between the h0-eigenvalue of the state and the h0-eigenvalue of the primary on
which it is built. therefore, the relative charges of the r states are dened to be integer, like for
the other n=2 algebras. we will denote the r singular vectors as |ri(q)+
or
|ri(q)
, where, in addition to the level l and the relative charge q, the helicities indicate that the
vector is annihilated by g+

0 , or both, or none, respectively.

l

now we will construct a one-to-one mapping between the r singular vectors and the topological
singular vectors that preserves the level l and the relative charge q. for this let us compose the
topological twists (2.1), which transform the topological n=2 algebra into the neveu-schwarz n=2
algebra, with the spectral ows, which transform the latter into the ramond n=2 algebra. let us
consider the odd spectral ow [27][22], which is the only fundamental spectral ow, as explained in
ref. [22]. it is given by the one-parameter family of transformations

6 2m,0 ,

a lm a = lm + hm + c
a hm a = hm  c
3 m,0 ,
a g+
a g

r a = g
r a = g+

r ,
r+ ,

(3.21)

satisfying a1

 = a and giving rise to isomorphic n=2 algebras. (it is therefore an involution).

29

if we denote by (, h) the (l0, h0) eigenvalues of any given state, then the eigenvalues of the
transformed state a|i are ( + h + c
3 ). if the state |i is a level-l secondary state
with relative charge q, then one deduces straightforwardly that the level of the transformed state
a|i changes to l + q while the relative charge q reverses its sign. for half-integer values of  the
spectral ows interpolate between the neveu-schwarz n=2 algebra and the ramond n=2 algebra.

6 2, h  c

by analysing the composition of the topological twists (2.1) and the spectral ows (3.21),
combining all possibilities, one obtains that the only mapping that transforms the topological
states into r states, preserving the level and the relative charge, is the composition a1/2 (t 
w )1:

|ri(q)

l = a1/2 (t 

w )1|i(q)

l

.

(3.22)

l = (t 
now let us show that if |i(q)

any other combination of the topological twists (2.1) and the spectral ows (3.21) changes either
the level or the relative charge of the states, or both, as the reader can easily verify10. furthermore
this mapping is one-to-one because it transforms every topological state into a r state, and the
other way around: |i(q)

w ) a1/2 |ri(q)

.

l

l

l = gn1|i(q)

l = qn1|i(q)

l = hn1|ri(q)

l = 0 , then |ri(q)

is singular, i.e. satises the topological h.w. conditions ln1|i(q)
l =
hn1|i(q)
is also singular, satisfying in turn the r
h.w. conditions ln1|ri(q)
l = g
l = 0 . to see this we
have to study rst the transformation, under a1/2 (t 
w )1, of the h.w. vectors of the topological
verma modules. thus we have four cases to analyse, corresponding to the topological h.w. vectors
being g0-closed |, hig, q0-closed |, hiq, chiral |0, hig,q, and no-label |0, hi. by carefully keep-
ing track of the transformation of the positive and zero modes of the topological generators one
obtains the following results:

n1|ri(q)

n1|ri(q)

l = g+

i) the g0-closed topological h.w. vectors |, hig are mapped by a1/2 (t

r h.w. vectors |r, hri+

r = | + c

24 , h + c

6 i+

ii) the q0-closed topological h.w. vectors |, hiq are mapped by a1/2 (t

24 , h + c

iv) the no-label topological h.w. vectors |0, hi are mapped by a1/2 (t 

w )1 to no-helicity r

h.w. vectors |r, hrir = | c

24 , h + c

6 ir.

now by taking into account that singular vectors are just particular cases of h.w. vectors
(secondary states that satisfy the h.w. conditions, to be precise) one deduces that the topological
singular vectors are transformed under a1/2 (t 
w )1 into r singular vectors, and with the helicities
determined by the exchange g  + , q   . that is, the g0-closed topological singular vectors are
mapped to helicity-(+) r singular vectors, the q0-closed topological singular vectors are mapped
to helicity-() r singular vectors, the chiral topological singular vectors are mapped to chiral r
singular vectors and the no-label topological singular vectors are mapped to no-helicity r singular

vectors. in addition, as we pointed out, these r singular vectors have the same level l and relative
charge q as the topological singular vectors. therefore all the results we have obtained for the
topological singular vectors and verma modules, summarized in tables (3.11)  (3.14) and gures
fig. i  fig. x are also valid for the singular vectors and verma modules of the ramond n=2
algebra, simply by taking into account that r =  + c
6 , and exchanging the labels
g  + and q   .

these results imply that the standard classication of the ramond singular vectors in two
sectors, the + sector and the  sector, where the singular vectors and the h.w. vectors on which they
are built have the same helicities, is not complete. the reason is that there also exist: i) singular
vectors with both helicities, like the level-zero singular vectors |ri(1)+
24 ,hi+ for
24 , ii) indecomposable singular vectors with no helicity11, and iii) singular vectors with the
 = c
opposite helicity than the h.w. vector of the verma module. the rst and the second possibilities

r
(c = 3r6
), like no-label topological singular vectors, as the spectral ows and topogical twists do
not modify the value of c. the third possibility occurs for  = c
24 due to the fact that the h.w.
vectors | c
r are in dierent verma modules, i.e. there is only one h.w. vector
in the verma modules (plus one level-zero chiral singular vector), so that one cannot chose the
helicity of the h.w. vector in order to build the singular vector of a given helicity. in addition in
these verma modules the number of singular vectors with helicity (+) is the same as the number
of singular vectors with helicity ().

as to the no-helicity h.w. vectors and verma modules, they always have level-zero singular

to nish, an interesting observation is that one gets exactly the same results by constructing
the mapping using the even spectral ow u [24][25] instead of the odd spectral ow a.

4 conclusions and final remarks

in this paper we have presented the determinant formulae for the verma modules of the topo-
logical n=2 superconformal algebra: the generic (standard) verma modules, the chiral verma
modules and the no-label verma modules. these were the last n=2 determinant formulae which
remained unpublished. (the absence of these formulae has created some confusion in the recent
literature, in fact). then we have analysed in very much detail the interpretation of the roots of the

11some examples of no-helicity r singular vectors were given in [17].

31

determinants in terms of singular vectors. as a bonus we have obtained a rst classication of the
dierent types of submodules, regarding size and shape, nding four dierent types (at least), in
contradiction with some claims in the literature that there are only two. a complete classication
of the dierent types of submodules requires a deeper understanding of the shape of these, which
in turn requires a classication of the subsingular vectors that is still lacking [28].

we have also identied the verma modules which contain chiral and no-label singular vectors.
the later are indecomposable primitive singular vectors which are not directly detected by the
determinant formulae (but their level-zero secondaries are) and only exist in generic verma modules.
as to the no-label verma modules, built on no-label h.w. vectors, they have two-dimensional
singular spaces already at level 1, and they reduce to chiral verma modules once the quotient by
the level-zero singular vectors is performed. we have found the interesting result that the singular
vectors of these chiral verma modules are mostly subsingular vectors in the original no-label verma
module.

finally we have transferred our analysis and results to the verma modules and singular vectors
of the ramond n=2 algebra, which have been very insuciently studied so far. in order to do this
we have found a one-to-one mapping between the topological singular vectors and the r singular
vectors which preserves the grading (level and relative charge). under this mapping, which is a
composition of the topological twists and the spectral ows, the topological singular vectors are
l  |ri(q)
transformed into r singular vectors in the following way: |i(q)g
,
|i(q)g,q
. our results imply that the standard classication of
the ramond singular vectors in two sectors, the + sector and the  sector, where the singular
vectors and the h.w. vectors on which they are built have the same helicities, is not complete. the
reason is that there also exist: singular vectors with both helicities (chiral), indecomposable singular
vectors with no helicity, and singular vectors with the opposite helicity than the h.w. vector of
the verma module. in particular, we have identied the standard verma modules with chiral and
indecomposable no-helicity singular vectors, which have been overlooked until very recently in the
literature. the no-helicity verma modules and submodules, built on no-helicity h.w. vectors, have
also been overlooked consequently.

in this appendix we will identify the generic verma modules v (|, hig) which contain chiral
(or both), and those which contain no-label singular

as explained in section 3, the determinant formula (3.1) implies the existence of singular vectors
of the types |i(0)g
2 built on g0-closed h.w. vectors |, hig with
conformal weight  = r,s, eq. (3.4), for c 6= 3, or with any conformal weight  for hs =  s
2 , for
c = 3. for simplicity in what follows we will denote these singular vectors as |i(0)g
and |i(1)q

our analysis showed that g0 and q0 interpolate between |i(0)g
, except in the cases
when these vectors have zero conformal weight, that is r,s + rs
2 = 0, for which this interpolation
breaks down. namely, at least one of the singular vectors |i(0)g
necessarily becomes
chiral and therefore is annihilated by both g0 and q0. a priori it is not possible to tell which one
of the two singular vectors becomes chiral, or if both become chiral, but by analysing some of their
coecients we will in the following give an answer to this question.

in ref. [18] we showed that singular vectors can be identied by their coecients with respect
to the terms of the ordering kernel. if two singular vectors agree in the coecients of the ordering
kernel then they are identical. in particular, if the coecients with respect to the ordering kernel
all vanish then the vector has to be trivial. the advantage of this procedure is that the ordering
kernel has at most two elements in our case, which means that we can identify singular vectors and
decide if they are trivial just by comparing only two coecients. in addition we can also deduce if
the vectors are g0-closed, q0-closed or chiral, as we will see. the ordering kernel for the uncharged
g0-closed singular vectors |i(0)g
at level l is given, for the general case c 6= 3 (t 6= 0), by [18]
{ll
1 g1q0}. the coecients of these vectors can easily be obtained from the coecients of
the uncharged singular vectors of the neveu-schwarz n=2 algebra12 given in eq. (3.11) of ref. [16].

it is easy to see that following the curve c the singular vectors |i(0)g
satisfy these two conditions
and therefore become chiral, i.e. of type |i(0)g,q
r,s does
generically not become chiral. the only exceptions to this rule are the discrete points ts,n =  s

for n = 1, . . . , r on the curve c+ where |i(0)g

apply. however, in the limit t  0 along curve c the singular vectors |i(0)g

again, there are two conditions which have to be satised, for the general case c 6= 3 (t 6= 0), for
these vectors to become chiral:

  rs

2 +  = 0 ,

 + 2   rs

2 = 0 .

(a.7)

as before we analyse whether these conditions are satised for the curves c+ or c. one nds
that both conditions hold for the curve c+. hence, |i(1)q
becomes chiral, i.e. of type |i(1)g,q
instead, on the curve c+. however, for c these conditions are generically not satised and therefore
|i(1)q
does not become chiral. the only exceptions to the generic case are again the discrete
points ts,n =  s
also becomes chiral. finally, in the limit
t  0 along curve c+ the singular vectors |i(1)q

are well dened, and chiral also consequently.

now we will investigate the appearance of no-label singular vectors at level l in generic verma
modules v (|l, hig). let us start with the uncharged no-label singular vectors |i(0)
l,|l,hig which
will be denoted simply as |i(0)
is necessarily accom-
panied at the same level l in the same verma module by three secondary singular vectors which
cannot come back to this one by acting with the algebra: one charged g0-closed singular vector
|i(1)g
, and one uncharged
chiral singular vector |i(0)g,q
. observe that the singular vector
l = 0 while q0g0|i(0)
|i(1)q
6= 0, as the
singular vectors |i(1)g
(built on |, hig) never become chiral. the fact that two charged singular
and |i(1)g
vectors of types |i(1)q
exist at the same level in the same generic verma module
v (|, hig) requires fr,s(, h, t) = g+
l (, h, t) = 0, given by eqns. (3.2) and (3.3), where l = rs

thus, following curve c1 or curve c2 by varying the parameter t we can assume that we have

a two dimensional singular vector space, as we proved in ref.
[18]. when the singular vectors
have zero conformal weight, i.e. in the case r,s = +
=  rs
always
rs
2
become chiral, as explained in section 3, whereas the singular vectors |i(0)g
become chiral only
under certain conditions that we have deduced a few paragraphs above. observe that the existence
of no-label singular vectors requires that these two uncharged singular vectors become chiral, and
therefore proportional, whereas the charged singular vector of type |i(1)q
should remain non-
chiral. these are necessary, although not sucient, conditions to guarantee the existence of the
no-label singular vectors.

let us therefore analyse the dierent possibilities when |i(0)g

r,s =  rs
to exist, leads to the solutions given by
curves c+ and c, eqns. (a.1) and (a.2). the solutions along curve c+, however, involve chiral
singular vectors of type |i(1)g,q

t = 2
r whereas in the second case there are solutions for all t provided s = 2. a closer look at these
solutions reveals that no-label singular vectors only exist for t = 2
r , in agreement with the low level
computations of these vectors given in refs. [12] and [17]. the argument goes as follows.

|i(0)g
. since these correspond to vectors in the kernel of the inner product matrix for the verma
module, one nds that for the case of both becoming chiral, and thus proportional, the rank of
the inner product matrix would rise for these particular points on the curve c1. but the inner
product matrix of the verma module contains only rational functions of t, , and h as entries and
therefore its rank is upper semi-continuous. as a consequence the rank cannot rise for particular
values of t and therefore for t = 2
needs to
exist at level13 rs
2 . for the solution s = 2 for all t, however, one nds that curves c2 and c are
identical. therefore, the vectors |i(0)q
are both chiral and proportional all along the
curve c2. as a result the corresponding space of uncharged singular vectors is just one-dimensional
and consequently an additional null vector is not required.

in two-dimensional spaces of uncharged singular vectors annihilated by q0, which do not exist, as
we proved in ref. [18]. finally, in ref. [16] conditions were given for verma modules containing two-

with the solutions t = 2

are neither g0-closed. the only possibility left is

therefore that |i(0)

are uncharged no-label singular vectors.

the unique solution s = 2, +

uncharged singular vectors is just one-dimensional so that no-label singular vectors do not exist.
(this solution can be viewed in fact as the case described above where c and c2 are identical, in
the limit t  0).

these results can easily be transferred to the other types of no-label singular vectors using the
[12]. since these mappings do not modify the value of t, one deduces
in particular,
, built on g0-closed h.w. vectors |r,s, hig,
r and

mappings analysed in ref.
that no-label singular vectors only exist for generic verma modules with t = 2
r .
no-label singular vectors of types |i(0)
appear at level l = rs
h = 1 + s

r (corresponding to c = 3r6

2 , and h = 1  s

), r,s =  rs

2 for t = 2

and |i(1)

2 + 1

r

l

l

2 + 1

r , respectively.

as an example, let us write the no-label singular vector |i(0)

built on a g0-closed h.w. vector
|r,s, hig, at level 1, together with the three secondary singular vectors that it generates at level
1 by the action of g0 and q0:

l

|i(0)

1,|1,1, t=2ig = (l1  h1)|1, 1, t = 2ig,

|i(1)g

1,|1,1, t=2ig = g0|i(0)

1,|1,1, t=2ig = 2g1|1, 1, t = 2ig,

|i(1)q

1,|1,1, t=2ig = q0|i(0)

1,|1,1, t=2ig = (l1q0  h1q0  q1)|1, 1, t = 2ig,

|i(0)g,q

1,|1,1, t=2ig = g0q0|i(0)

1,|1,1, t=2ig = 2(2l1 + g1q0)|1, 1, t = 2ig.

(a.13)

(a.14)

(a.15)

(a.16)

the no-label singular vector only exists for t = 2 (c = 3) whereas the three secondary singular
vectors are just the particular cases, for t = 2, of the one-parameter families of singular vectors of
the corresponding types, which exist for all values of t. (the singular vectors of the topological
n=2 algebra at level 1 were given in ref. [12]). moreover, the singular vector |i(1)g
1,|1,1ig is always
primitive for any value of t, except for t = 2, the singular vector |i(1)q
1,|1,1ig is also primitive,
except for t = 2, even when it becomes chiral (for t = 2), and the singular vector |i(0)g,q
1,|1,1ig
is always secondary, except for the value t = 2 (c = 9), for which it becomes primitive together
with the other chiral singular vector |i(1)g,q

1,|1,1ig.

appendix b

in what follows we present the complete set of singular vectors at level 1 in verma modules of
the topological n=2 algebra with zero conformal weight  = 0. that is, the singular vectors at
level 1 in: generic verma modules v (|0, hig) and v (|0, hiq), chiral verma modules v (|0, hig,q),
and no-label verma modules v (|0, hi). several of these singular vectors were written down in ref.
[12] (for any value of  in the case of generic verma modules).

all these singular vectors also apply for c = 3 (t = 0) and no additional singular vectors appear for
this value. chiral singular vectors and no-label singular vectors at level 1 require  = 1, therefore
they are absent for  = 0.

for each of these pairs the singular vector on the left is the particular case, for c = 9, of the
one-parameter family of singular vectors that exists for all values of c, given in eqns. (b.13) or
(b.18). the singular vectors on the right, however, are the particular cases of a one-parameter
family of subsingular vectors that turn out to be singular just for c = 9.
