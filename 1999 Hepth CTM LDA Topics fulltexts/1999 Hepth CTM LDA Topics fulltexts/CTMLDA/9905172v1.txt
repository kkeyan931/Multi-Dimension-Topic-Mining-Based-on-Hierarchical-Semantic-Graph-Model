abstract

we investigate two-loop quantum corrections to non-minimally coupled
maxwell-chern-simons theory. the non-minimal gauge interaction repre-
sents the magnetic moment interaction between the charged scalar and the
electromagnetic eld. we show that one-loop renormalizability of the theory
found in previous work does not survive to two-loop level. however, with
an appropriate choice of the non-minimal coupling constant, it is possible to
renormalize the two-loop eective potential and hence render it potentially
useful for a detailed analysis of spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by
radiative corrections.

i. introduction

maxwell-chern-simons electrodynamics has been studied extensively in recent years for
a variety of reasons. the chern-simons term gives the photon a topological mass without
spontaneously breaking gauge symmetry [1] and allows for the existence of charged particles
with fractional statistics [2]. pure chern-simons scalar electrodynamics admits topological
and non-topological self-dual solitons, for which many exact solutions to the classical equa-
tions of motion are available [3]. moreover, such theories may also have physical signicance.
relativistic three dimensional chern-simons theories provide a consistent description of the
high temperature limit of four dimensional gauge theories [4], and certain solid state systems
with planar dynamics [2]. in addition, the non-relativistic version of maxwell-chern-simons
theory has been applied to the fractional hall eect, and more recently to rotating superuid
3he-a [5].

recently a version of scalar electrodynamics in three dimensions has been studied in
which a non-minimal chern-simons type gauge interaction was introduced. the non-
minimal coupling in this model represents a magnetic moment interaction between the
charged scalar and the electromagnetic eld. it is of interest for several reasons. firstly,
it is well known that one of the most important features of scalar quantum electrodynam-
ics (qed) is the occurrence of the coleman-weinberg mechanism [6]. in scalar qed with
non-minimal coupling, the chern-simons term is generated through the coleman-weinberg

1

mechanism [7]. in this sense, the non-minimal model is the one in which the chern-simons
term arises naturally rather than being put in by hand.

another reason that the non-minimal model is of interest involves the study of vortex
solutions. in recent years, the classical vortex solutions of 2+1-dimensional chern-simons
eld theories have received considerable attention [3, 8]. to nd such a solution exactly,
the model must be self-dual. a self-dual theory is one in which the classical equations of
motion can be reduced from second- to rst-order dierential equations. in the absence of
a maxwell term, scalar qed with a chern-simons term is self-dual, and the topological
and non-topological vortex solutions have been found with an appropriately chosen scalar
potential [3]. however, if the maxwell term is present, a self-dual maxwell-chern-simons
theory can be achieved only if a magnetic moment interaction between the scalar and the
gauge eld, i.e. the non-minimal chern-simons coupling, is introduced [8, 9].

it is well known that maxwell-chern-simons scalar qed is renormalizable. non-minimal
gauge interactions are, however, notoriously non-renormalizable in four dimensions. there
is some hope that the situation might be dierent in three dimensions. some time ago it was
found by two of us that the non-minimal chern-simons coupling in 2+1-dimensional scalar
electrodynamics is actually renormalizable at the one-loop level [7]. the renormalizability
occurs because the non-minimal gauge interaction contains the three-dimensional antisym-
metric tensor. an analysis [7] of the symmetry breaking by induced radiative corrections
shows that at the one-loop level the non-minimal model behaves dierently from the min-
imally coupled one. in the usual maxwell-chern-simons scalar qed, symmetry breaking
results from quantum corrections but depends on the choice of a renormalization scale [10],
whereas in the non-minimal model the symmetry breaking is unambiguous and there is a
nite temperature phase transition to the symmetry restored state.

it is clearly of interest to discover whether the renormalizability of this model persists be-
yond one-loop level and to compare the symmetry breaking phase transitions in the minimal
and non-minimal models at higher orders. the two-loop behaviour of the minimal model
has recently been analyzed in detail [10] where it was shown that the coleman-weinberg
mechanism occurs at two-loops. the purpose of the present paper is to commence a detailed
analysis of the two-loop behaviour of the non-minimally coupled maxwell-chern-simons the-
ory. we will show that the model, not surprisingly, is not renormalizable at two-loop level.
however, the two-loop eective potential can be made renormalizable providing certain con-
ditions are satised by the coupling constants of the model. thus we will show that under
certain circumstances (i.e. when the lowest order in the momentum expansion is sucient)
the model may yield physically relevant predictions for the spontaneous symmetry break-
ing by radiative corrections at the two-loop level. a detailed analysis on the renormalized
eective potential and the consequent symmetry breaking is deferred to a future publication.
the paper is organized as follows. sect ii is a brief review, containing an introduction
to the model, a discussion of some technical aspects of dimensional regularization in 2+1
dimensions, and a list of some of the necessary feynman rules. sect iii demonstrates that
the full eective action is not renormalizable at the two loop-level. sect iv is devoted to the
(somewhat lengthy) calculation of the two-loop eective potential in the ms substraction
scheme.
in contrast to the one-loop case, the renormalizability of the two-loop eective
potential requires a specic choice of the non-minimal coupling constant. our conclusions
are summarized in sect v, while some useful formulae are collected in the appendix.

where the complex scalar eld  can be decomposed into the real and imaginary parts,
 =  + i; f = a  a; d =  + iea, and 0, e and  are the non-
minimal chern-simons coupling, the gauge coupling and the scalar self-interaction coupling
constants, respectively. the dimensional assignments for the elds and coupling constants
are as follows:

[a] = [] = [e] = m 1/2,

[0] = m 1/2,

[] = m 0.

(2)

the negative mass dimension of 0 indicates that the theory is not renormalizable in general.
following the standard technique to calculate the eective potential we rst assume
the existence of a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value for the scalar eld hi = v
with v real, and shift the real part of the scalar eld,    + v [11]. we look for a
non-vanishing value of v by determining the minimum of the eective potential generated
by quantum corrections. note that in the lagrangian (1), we have put the bare mass of
the scalar eld, the quartic scalar self-interaction coupling and the statistical parameter of
a possible chern-simons term equal to zero, even though these terms are allowed by the
gauge symmetry. the corresponding counterterms may appear, however, in the counterterm
lagrangian. the physical parameters can be obtained in the usual way, i.e. by choosing
renormalization conditions that give zero renormalized parameters at v = 0. to avoid the
infrared divergences we use the landau-type r gauge [12]. the gauge-xing term is

b. regularization

a regularization scheme must be chosen to handle the ultraviolet divergences of the
theory.
in this paper we shall use dimensional regularization. the use of dimensional
regularization in a theory that explicitly depends on epsilon tensors involves adopting a
complicated form for the gauge eld propagator, as will be discussed below.
in spite of
this complication, dimensional regularization is simpler than the pauli-villars regularization
adopted in the previous paper [7] since it allows us to preserve explicit gauge symmetry.

there are several problems involved with analytic continuation to n dimensions. the

rst of these is standard. the mass dimensions of the elds and parameters become,

[] = [a] = [v] = m (n2)/2;

[e] = m (3n)/2,

[0] = m (2n)/2,

[] = m 2(3n),

(5)

and thus, in order to ensure that the parameters keep their original mass dimensions, one
must make the following replacements for the parameters in the regularized lagrangian,

v(n3)/2v, e(3n)/2e, 0(3n)/20, 2(3n).

(6)

the second problem is more complicated. dimensional regularization in a theory with a
three-dimensional antisymmetric tensor  must be handled carefully. it has been explicitly
shown that naive dimensional regularization schemes cannot make the theory well dened
when they are applied to a chern-simons type model [13]. therefore, in carrying out
dimensional regularization we must adopt the three-dimensional analogue of the consistent
denition for 5, which was originally proposed by t hooft and veltman [14], and later
given a strict mathematical justication by breitenlohner and maison [15]. the explicit
denition of this dimensional continuation for chern-simons-type theory was explained in
ref. [16] where it is shown that this regularization method is indeed compatible with the
slavnov-taylor identities. the explicit denition for the dimensional continuation of the
epsilon and the metric tensors is

 =( 1 if () = permutation of (0, 1, 2)

0 otherwise

g =( +1 for  =  = 0
g =( +1 for  =  = 0
1 for  =  = 1, 2.

these denitions give rise to the following contractions,


p = gp,

c. feynman rules

(11)

(13)

(14)

these expressions are useful to simplify calculations.

there are several mass poles in the dimensional regularized gauge eld propagator. the
rst two terms in (10) show that m1 and m2 are the photon masses in the original three-
dimensional space-time. the third term indicates that m3 is the mass that photons acquire
in n  3 dimensional space-time. the last term is proportional to an evanescent quantity,
p2  ep2, and the power-counting shows that this term behaves as 1/p5 for large p. in the
two-loop calculation the contribution of this term at the level of regularization is nite and
hence vanishes in the limit n  3.
the interaction vertices of the model were derived in ref. [7]. these vertices are shown
in figs. 1-3 with dotted lines denoting gauge bosons, while solid lines corresponding to

6

either the  eld or the  eld, as labeled. for conciseness, the vertices in the gures are
labeled purely by their number, so that for example 3b denotes v3b, etc. the feynman rules
for the vertices and the corresponding interaction lagrangians are as follows:

v1b(42) = v1b(24) = i/5;
v2b(32) = v2c(4) = iv/5;

l(1)  v1a(6) = i,
l(2)  v2a(5) = iv,
l(3)  v3a(4) = iv2/2,
l(4)  v4a(3) = iv3/6,
l(5) + l(6)  v5(a) + v6(a) = e(p  q) + i0 k p;
l(7) + l(8)  v7(2a2) + v8(2a2) = v7(2a2) + v8(2a2) = 2ie2g  e0v(p  q);
l(9) + l(10)  v9(a2) + v10(a2) = e0v(k  q) + 2ie2vg.

v3b(22) = v3b(4) = iv2/10;
v4b(2) = iv3/30;

(15)

iii. two-loop renormalizability

in this section we discuss the renormalizability of the theory at the two-loop level. in
order to show that the theory is renormalizable we must show that contributions to the
two-loop quantum eective action from terms that do not appear in the original lagrangian
are nite. the supercial degree of divergence (sdd) of a diagram is given by

 = 3l +xv

vvv  2i,

(16)

where l is the number of loops, i is the number of internal lines, v is the number of
derivatives associated with each vertex, and vv is the number of vertices of each type. the
sum is over all vertices in the diagram. we can rewrite this expression using the following
relations,

l = i + 1  v,
i =
ivvv,

1

2xv

lv = iv + ev,

(17)

where v =pv vv is the number of vertices, lv is the total number of lines entering vertex v,

and iv and ev are respectively the number of internal and external lines entering the vertex
v. furthermore, there exists a relation between the number of vertices and lines,

lvvv = 2i + e.

xv

using (17) with l = 2 this constraint can be written as

consequently, we have the sdd

(lv  2)vv = 2 + e

(21)

to explicitly verify the renormalizability, we need to look at the 1pi parts of the green
functions that have positive sdd but no correspondence in the classical lagrangian. we
consider the 1pi part of the four-point function of gauge elds, a4haaaai.
it is
straightforward to determine which combinations of vertices satisfy the two conditions (19)
and (21). one must then select those combinations from which it is possible to obtain a
diagram with four external photon lines. we categorize these diagrams in three groups:
diagrams with two internal v 

6s, one internal v6 and no internal v6.

from (21) all diagrams with 2 v 

note that when calculating the sdd of an a4 diagram, the following points must be
taken into account. if v6 is an external vertex, then its degree of divergence is 6 = 1/2
instead of 6 = 1/2. this change occurs because of the fact that v6 carrys one factor of
momentum from the photon line, which becomes an external momentum when v6 is an
external vertex. similarly, the degree of divergence of v8 is reduced to 8 = 1 instead of
8 = 0 when v8 is an external vertex (v8 is considered an external vertex if both photon lines
are external legs). these exceptions must be considered in looking for divergent diagrams.
6s have sdd = 2, 1, or 0. the diagrams with sdd
8s are shown in figs. 4-10. it is straightforward to see that if
equal to 0 and no external v 
the sdd is 2, then the graph has two external v 
8s. as discussed above, these graphs have
factors of the external photon momentum from the vertices v8 which can be factored out,
leaving a two-loop integral with sdd =0. the diagrams are the same as those shown in
fig. 4, with the external v 
8s. if the sdd is 1, then the diagram has one
external v8. these graphs also have a factor of external photon momentum which can be
factored out to leave an integral of sdd=0. the diagrams are the same as those shown in
shown in figs. 5-7 with the external v 

7s replaced by v 

7s replaced by v 

8s.

the same thing happens for diagrams with one v6. the sdd is either 1 or 0. the
diagrams with sdd equal to 0 and no external v 
8s are shown in figs. 11, 12. if the sdd
is 1, then the diagram has an external v8 which reduces the sdd to 0, with a prefactor
that contains an external photon momentum. these diagrams are the same as those shown
8s
8s. for the diagrams with no v6, all v 
in fig. 11 with the external v 
contribute one photon line which is internal and one which is external, and thus contribute
the naive value 8 = 0 to the counting of the diagrams sdd. all divergent diagrams have
sdd=0 and are shown in figs. 13-15.

7s replaced by v 

8

note that all of the diagrams with external v 

5s have partner diagrams with all possible
combinations and permutations of v 
6s. these partner diagrams will have the
same sdd=0 as the original diagrams, but they will contain additional factors of external
photon momenta, since they contain external v 

the above analysis shows that all the two-loop divergent diagrams for a4 have sdd=0.
for the purpose of studying renormalizability, we need to extract only the divergent parts
and see whether they cancel. there are several simplications that one can make when
extracting the divergent part of a diagram with sdd=0. we start by considering the scalar
propagator. when a scalar propagator (8) contains an external momentum it has the form

5s replaced by v 

6s.

s(q + p, m) =

1

(q + p)2  m2

where p is an external momentum and q is an internal monentum that will be integrated
over. to study the uv behaviour of this propagator we can employ following decomposition,

s(q + p, m) =

1

(q + p)2  m2 =

1
q2 

2pq + p2  m2
q2 [(q + p)2  m2]

.

(22)

the uv degree of divergence of the second term is one less than that of the rst term and
thus gives no contribution to the uv divergent part of the integral. thus, in calculating the
divergent part of the integral, we can make the replacement

s(q + p, m)s(q)  1/q2.

(23)

to avoid the ir divergence induced by this procedure, it is necessary to keep the mass term
at least in one propagator, i.e. replace s(q + p, m) by s(q, m). we will keep all three.

similar simplications are possible for the gauge propagator (10). firstly, the evanescent
parts of the gauge eld propagator will give vanishing contribution to the uv divergent part
of the integral in the limit n3 since they have good uv behaviour. secondly, the uv
degree of divergence of the parity odd term in the gauge eld propagator is one less than
that of the parity even part of the propagator. thus, there are no contributions to the
uv divergent part of the integral from terms in the propagator that are proportional to
the epsilon tensor. lastly, as explained above for the scalar propagator, factors of external
momentum can be dropped.

in addition, the calculation is simplied because of the fact that there are no uv diver-
gences at one-loop in dimensional regularization. this fact is due to the special analytic
properties of the one-loop amplitudes in odd dimensional space-time [17]. as a consequence,
there is no need for us to consider the subtraction of sub-divergences.

using the above observations, one can show that all divergent terms will be proportional

to the two-loop integral of the form,

i =z dk z dqs(q) s(k) s(k + q, m)

(24)

with dkd3k/(2)3. the divergence will appear as a pole of the form 1/(3  n).
we concentrate rst on diagrams in which the prefactor does not depend on the external
photon momentum (figs. 4-15). these diagrams can be further classied into three groups

9

by coupling constant prefactors. the rst group of diagrams is shown in figs. 4, 5, 8, 11,
13, 14 and is proportional to e22
0, the second group is shown in figs. 6, 7, 10, 12, 15 and
is proportional to e42
0(0v)2. the third group are shown in fig. 9 and is proportional to
0(0v)4. each of these sets of diagrams must be separately nite if the theory is to be
e42
renormalizable. we will concentrate on the rst group of diagrams, figs. 4, 5, 8, 11, 13, 14.
direct calculation shows that the divergent pieces cancel between the diagrams in figs. 4,
5, 8, 11, 13, while fig. 14 is nite.

5s replaced by v 

as a further check, we calculate the a4 term with four external momentum factors. gauge
invariance requires that this contribution should take the form (f)4, and renormalizability
requires that it be nite. we obtain contributions from the diagrams in fig. 8, with all of
the external v 
6s. direct calculation shows that the divergent pieces cancel.
unfortunately, further checking reveals that the action is not in fact renormalizable.
we have calculated the 4 term with four external momentum factors. the corresponding
diagrams are shown in fig. 16. this term is a contribution to the gauge invariant structure
(d)4 and must be nite if the action is to be renormalizable. we nd that in this case
the divergent terms do not cancel so that the two-loop quantum eective action is not
renormalizable.

however, as we will show in the next section, the two-loop eective potential can be
made renormalizable providing certain conditions are satised by the coupling constants in
the model. therefore, for the lowest order in the momentum expansion of the quantum
eective action, the non-minimal model may yield physically relevant predictions for the
spontaneous symmetry breaking by the radiative corrections at the two-loop level.

iv. the effective potential

the eective potential is the energy density of the vacuum in which the expectation
value of the scalar eld is given by hi = v [11]. it can be determined from the eective
action [e] according to
where e is the vacuum expectation value of the scalar eld in the presence of the external
source. using the fact that [e] is the generating functional of the proper vertex,

[e = v] = (2)n(n)(0)ve(v),

(25)

[e] =

xj=1

(26)

one has

ve(v) = 

1
j!

xj=2

(j)(0, 0,  , 0)vj,

(27)

which means that one can get the eective potential by calculating the 1pi vacuum diagrams.
from eq.(27) we can write [18]

ve(v) = v (tree)(v)

(28)

where d1(p) is the inverse propagator for each of the bosonic elds in the theory. the
second term of (28) is the one-loop eective potential, and the third term contains the
higher order contributions. we shall use this expression to get the two-loop contribution to
the eective potential.

a. one-loop eective potential in dimensional regularization

the one-loop eective potential of this model was computed in ref. [7] in pauli-villars
regularization. in order to discuss spontaneous symmetry breaking, we now re-calculate the
one-loop eective potential using dimensional regularization. according to (28) we have

b. two-loop eective potential

it is straightforward to see that the two-loop eective potential is given by diagrams
that contain only vertices from the cubic and quartic parts of the interaction lagrangian.
all of these diagrams are either theta type diagrams, or gure eight type diagrams. for
each diagram we give the integral expression for the amplitude. the integral is evaluated
by rotating to euclidean space and using the integrals given in the appendix. the theta
diagrams contain ultraviolet divergent terms and the results are separated into divergent
and nite pieces. the divergent piece is represented by the integral i as dened in the
appendix, and thus proportional to the factor

1

3  n   + 1 + ln4

where  is the euler constant. as a last step we use (11) to write the results in terms of the
fundamental parameters e, 0 and v.

having obtained an expression for the eective potential, the next step is to absorb the
divergent terms into renormalized coupling constants by choosing certain renormalization
conditions. however, from (41), it is easy to see that v (4)div
contains terms proportional
to v8. since these terms would require counterterms that have no correspondence in the
classical lagrangian, we must require that they vanish to ensure the renormalizability of
two-loop eective potential. this can be done by imposing the constraint,

the rst, trivial solution, merely veries that the theory is renormalizable in the limit
0  0. for the case of a nite non-minimal chern-simons coupling, we must choose the
second solution and impose a non-trivial relation between this non-minimal coupling and
the other fundamental coupling constants of the theory. note that our result that the non-
minimal coupling depends on the fundamental couplings is consistent with the fact that
in a theory without non-minimal chern-simons coupling the magnetic moment interaction
would be generated through quantum corrections [19].

to summarize, in the ms scheme, the total eective potential is given by,

ve = v 0 + v oneloop

(55)

it is renormalizable if and only if the second condition in eq.(54) is satised by the coupling
constants.

v. summary and conclusions

we have studied in some details the two-loop quantum behaviour of 2 + 1-dimensional
scalar qed with a non-minimal chern-simons coupling. as expected from dimensional
arguments, the complete theory is not renormalizable beyond the one-loop level. this is
not a major problem in principle, since the theory is most reasonably considered as an
eective eld theory describing magnetic moment interactions between the charged scalar
and the electromagnetic elds. at this level the renormalizability is useful because it limits
the number of parameters that must be introduced at each order in perturbation theory in
order to make unambiguous predictions. we nd that the eective potential, which is the
zeroth order contribution to the quantum eective action in the momentum expansion, can
be made renormalizable providing the fundamental couplings are related to the non-minimal
one by the condition (54). it is of interest to further examine the eective potential with this
condition imposed. the renormalization of the two-loop eective potential using a physical
renormalization scheme is a straightforward but lengthy procedure. this, plus an analysis
of the resulting symmetry breaking mechanism, will be the subject of a future publication.

appendix a: two-loop integration formula

this appendix is a collection of the integration formula used in the calculation of two-
loop eective potential. denoting dk = dnk/(2)n and using the following notation for the
euclidean space propagators:

s1(q) =

1

q2 + m2
1

, s2(k) =

1

k2 + m2
2

, s3(k + q) =

1

(k + q)2 + m2
3

,

s3  s1(q)s2(k)s3(k + q),

we introduce the following integrals:

i =z dk dq s3;
n1 =z dk s(k), n2 =z dk k2s(k), n3 =z dk k4s(k);

19

k  =z dk dq qqkk s3; t  =z dk dq qqqk s3;
l =z dk dq qqqqkk s3; r =z dk dq qqqkkk s3.

contracting the tensor indices in various combinations with the n- and three-dimensional
metric tensors, we get the integrations needed for two-loop calculations,

k1 =z dk dq q2k2s3 ,
fk1 =z dk dq q2k2s3 ,
t1 =z dk dq q2(k  q)s3 ,
l1 =z dk dq q4k2s3 ,
l2 =z dk dq q2k  q)2s3 ,
l5 =z dk dq q2 q2k2s3 ,
r1 =z dk dq q2k2(q  k)s3 ,
r4 =z dk dq q2k2(k  q)s3 ,

k2 =z dk dq (k  q)2s3 ,
fk2 =z dk dq (k  q)2s3 ;
et1 =z dk dq q2(k  q)s3 ,
el1 =z dk dq q4k2s3 ,
l3 =z dk dq q2 q2k2s3 ,
l6 =z dk dq q2(k  q)2s3 ;
r2 =z dk dq (q  k)3s3 ,
r5 =z dk dq q2k2(k  q)s3 .

t2 =z dk dq q2(k  q)s3 ;
l2 =z dk dq q2(k  q)2s3 ,
l4 =z dk dq q4k2s3 ,
