abstract

in the previous paper [hep-th/9904129], we constructed a general explicit

bps solution for (f, d3) non-threshold bound state. by using the sl(2,z)

symmetry of type iib string theory, we here construct from (f, d3) a more

general bps conguration for a d3 brane with certain units of quantized

5-form ux and an innite number of parallel (f, d1)-strings. we study its

decoupling limit and nd that given maldacenas ads5/cf t4 correspondence

with respect to simple d3 branes and with the usual string coupling, we should

have a similar correspondence with respect to this bound state but now with

an eective string coupling. we discuss possible descendants of this bound

state by t-dualities along its longitudinal or transverse directions. in partic-

ular, we present explicit congurations for ((f, dp), d(p + 2)) bound states

for 2  p  5. all these congurations preserve one half of the spacetime
supersymmetries.

1

i. introduction

in the previous paper [1], we showed that for the non-threshold bound state (f, d3) the

dilaton in general does not remain constant as opposed to a simple d3 brane conguration,

even though in both cases one half of the spacetime supersymmetries are preserved. however,

the dilaton was still found to be bounded from below by its asymptotic value and from above

by its nite horizon value. the eective string coupling, dened as ge = e, decreases its

value when we move from asymptotic region to the horizon region. this is caused by the

innite number of f-strings in the bound state. in the so-called decoupling limit, this bound

state is expected to be described either by elds in the bulk spacetime or by the n = 4 u(n)
sym theory in 1 + 3 dimensions (with n the 5-form charge associated with the 3-brane in

(f, d3)). in the bulk, we need to study only the near-horizon region under this limit. we
found that the near-horizon string metric of (f, d3) was not automatically ads5  s5 but
under some constant rescalings of the coordinates it became ads5s5. the resulting metric
then became identical with the near-horizon geometry of an equivalent simple d3 brane with

5-form charge n with the eective string coupling evaluated at the horizon rather than the

usual string coupling. following the symmetry argument of maldacena [2], we mentioned

that we must have an ads5/cf t4 correspondence with respect to this eective vacuum

conguration of the equivalent simple d3 brane. the gauge coupling for the sym theory

became related to the eective string coupling rather than the usual string coupling as

g2
ym = 2ge.

after the rescalings of the coordinates, the information about the f-strings in the (f,

d3) in the metric disappeared completely. the only dierence between the equivalent simple

d3 brane with the usual simple d3 brane just mentioned was the string coupling constant.

so this indicated that the eect of the f-strings must be encoded into this eective string

coupling. indeed, we found that the tension for this equivalent simple d3 brane was nothing

but the tension for the (f, d3) bound state. this indicated that the eective vacuum

mentioned above was nothing but the (f, d3) bound state. the vacuum conguration for

2

the sym theory in that case does not contain the electric ux lines. we also found that the

eect of the electric ux lines in the worldvolume picture of the (f, d3) bound state gets

absorbed into the gauge coupling constant g2

ym = 2ge. therefore, we had a consistent

picture both in the bulk and on the brane.

thus the ads5/cf t4 correspondence of maldacena was found to hold true even for this

non-trivial d3 brane conguration, namely, (f, d3) but with the corresponding eective

string coupling rather than the usual string coupling. we also observed that the eective

string coupling was quantized in terms of the integral charges associated with the f-strings

and the d3 brane in the (f, d3) bound state. in particular, it can be independent of the

usual string coupling in certain limit.

in testing maldacenas ads5/cf t4 conjecture, most of the current activities are placed
in relating the perturbative particle-like modes of type iib supergravity on ads5  s5 with
the operators of the boundary n = 4 sym theory. in [1], we took a dierent step in relating
non-trivial (non-perturbative) (f, d3) conguration in the bulk to the corresponding one in

sym on the boundary. actually, there already exist some eorts [47] in this direction, for

example, in [6,7] certain eects of d-instantons of type iib theory in the decoupling limit

have been checked to match with those of the instantons in ym theory on the boundary.

in this paper, we continue our study for a more general d3 brane conguration, namely,

the non-threshold ((f, d1), d3) bound state. we construct this conguration explicitly in

the following section by using the type iib sl(2,z) symmetry and the (f, d3) conguration

given in [1]. in section 3, we study the properties of this ((f, d1), d3) bound state and its

decoupling limit. we nd that the ads5/cf t4 correspondence holds true in the same spirit

as in [2] for this ((f, d1), d3) bound states but once again with the corresponding eective

string coupling rather than the usual string coupling. the eective string coupling is also

quantized as in [1] in terms of integral charges associated with the f-strings, d-strings and

d3 brane in the ((f, d1), d3) bound state. in particular, we nd that d-strings in the ((f,

d1), d3) tend to increase the eective string coupling while the f-strings tend to decrease

it. in section 4, we present all possible descendants of this ((f, d1), d3) bound state by

3

t-dualities.

in particular, we nd non-threshold (dp, dp) bound states for 1  p  7,
where, the two dps share (p 1) common directions. we also nd a seemingly unique non-
threshold (d2, d2, d2) bound state, where, the three d2s share one common direction. we

discuss the possible role of these bound states in the m- or u-theory. we also present the

explicit congurations for the ((f, dp), d(p + 2)) bound states for 2  p  5. we conclude
this paper in section 5.

ii. non-threshold ((f, d1), d3) bound state

in this section, we will construct the non-threshold ((f, d1), d3) bound state using

the type iib sl(2,z) symmetry and the (f, d3) solution given in [1]. we will follow the

procedure outlined in [8,9]. we take the initial conguration as (f, d3) solution, with

vanishing asymptotic values for all non-vanishing elds. this is given by the following

einstein metric,

ds2 = (h h)1/4hh 1(cid:16)(dx0)2 + (dx1)2(cid:17) + h 1(cid:16)(dx2)2 + (dx3)2(cid:17) + dyidyii ,

(2.1)

with i = 1,   , 6; the dilaton,

e =   h 

h !1/2

,

and the remaining non-vanishing elds,

h (1)
3 = m 1/2
h (2)
3 = m n 1
20q3

0

h5 = n

(m,n) dh 1  dx0  dx1,
(m,n) h 2 dh  dx2  dx3,

5

(5 + 5) .

(2.2)

(2.3)

in the above, h (1)
3

and h (2)
3

are the nsns and rr 3-form eld strengths, respectively, and

they form a doublet

h3 = 


h (1)
3
h (2)
3

,




4

(2.4)

under the classical sl(2,r) symmetry of type iib string theory. h5 is the self-dual 5-form

eld strength which is inert under either sl(2,r) or sl(2,z). h is a harmonic function

h = 1 +

q3
r4 ,

(2.5)

with r2  yiyi and q3 = 1/2
as,

(m,n)20q3

0/(45), h  is a second harmonic function dened

h  = 1 +

n2q3/(m,n)

r4

.

also in the above, the -factor has the form,

(m,n) = m2 + n2,

(2.6)

(2.7)

where the asymptotic values of the scalars have been set to zero. here n is the quantized

5-form ux or 3-brane charge and m is the quantized ns string charge or the number of

f-strings through a (2)2 area of the 2-dimensional plane perpendicular to the strings in

(f, d3) as discussed in [1]. m and n are relatively prime integers. unless stated otherwise, 
always denotes the hodge dual. n denotes the volume form on an n-sphere and the volume

of a unit n-sphere is

n =

2(n+1)/2

((n + 1)/2)

.

in the above 20 = (2)7/22 and qp

0 is the unit charge for a dp-brane dened as,

qp
0  (2)(72p)/2(3p)/2.

(2.8)

(2.9)

it is well-known that type iib supergravity possesses a classical sl(2,r) symmetry [10]

and a discrete subgroup sl(2,z) of this group is now believed [11] to survive as a quantum

symmetry of the non-perturbative type iib string theory. under a global sl(2,r) transfor-

mation , we have the following transformations for the einstein metric g, the 3-form eld

strength doublet h, the 5-form eld strength h5 and the scalar matrix m parameterizing
the coset sl(2,r)/so(2) as

5

g  g, m  mt , h  (1)th, h5  h5,

(2.10)

where the sl(2,r)/so(2) coset scalar matrix is dened as,

m = e


e2 + 2

,




(2.11)

with , the dilaton and , the axion (or rr scalar) in type iib supergravity.

since there are an innite number of (f, d1)-strings in ((f, d1), d3), as discussed in

[1], the corresponding charges for f-strings and d-strings should be calculated according to

e(i) =

1

20 zr2s 5(cid:16)mij  h (j)

3  ijb(j)

2  h5(cid:17) ,

(2.12)

where i, j = 1, 2 and ij is the totally antisymmetric sl(2,r) invariant tensor with 12 = 1.

in general, e(i) are innite because of the innite number of f-strings and d-strings in ((f,

d1), d3). as discussed in [1], the following quantities q(i) are nevertheless quantized,

q(i)  (2)2

e(i)

20a2

,

(2.13)

where a2 = r dx2dx3 is the coordinate area of the x2x3-plane. the quantities q(1) and q(2)

represent charges associated with the f-strings and d-strings or the number of f-strings and

d-strings through a (2)2 area over the x2x3-plane measured in some units. from eqs.
(2.12) and (2.10), we nd that the charge doublet qt = (q(1), q(2)) will transform under an
sl(2,r) transformation as

q  q.

(2.14)

we will use the above transformations eqs. (2.10) and (2.14) to obtain the non-threshold

((f, d1), d3) conguration from the given initial (f, d3) solution eqs.(2.1)(2.7). since

the 5-form eld strength is inert under the sl(2,r) transformation, we expect that the

expression for h5 given in eq. (2.3) remains unchanged.

in other words, the integer n

remains the same. however, the integral ns-string charge m must be changed under the

sl(2,r) transformation . in general, it cannot remain as an integer, i.e, quantized. for

6

this reason, one either needs to introduce a compensating factor for m by hand [8] or take

the initial conguration with an arbitrary classical charge 1/2

(p,q) [9] in place of m such

that the resulting ns-string and d-string charges can be quantized. the process of charge

quantization also determines this factor in terms of the quantized ns-string and rr-string

charges and the asymptotic values of the dilaton and the axion. we will choose the later

approach, i.e., we take the integer m as an arbitrary classical charge 1/2

(p,q) in the above (f,

d3) solution.

as usual, we start with the zero asymptotic values of  and , i.e., m0 = i, with i the
unit matrix. here m0 denotes the scalar matrix m when the scalars take their asymptotic
values. we now seek a 2  2 sl(2,r) matrix 0 which maps the zero asymptotic values of
 and  to 0 and 0 (which are arbitrary but given) as

0it

0 = 0t

0 = m0 = e0

the above equation xes the sl(2,r) matrix 0 in terms of 0, 0 and an undetermined

so(2) angle  as

(2.16)




0 = e0/2


imposing charge quantization on q(i) as q(1) = p, q(2) = q with p, q relatively prime

integers for our general ((f, d1), d3) bound state, we have from eq. (2.14)

p

(2.17)

the above equation xes not only the sl(2,r) matrix 0 completely but also the (p,q)-factor

in terms of p, q and 0, 0 as

0 =

(p  0q) e0

,




(2.18)

and

7

(p,q) = e0 (p  0 q)2 + e0q2,

(2.19)

which is invariant under an sl(2,z) transformation. note that in this process the so(2)

angle  gets xed as ei = h(p  0q)e0/2 + iqe0/2i 1/2

(p,q) .

once we have the sl(2,r) matrix 0 (eq. (2.18)), we can obtain a general ((f, d1), d3)

conguration by performing the sl(2,r) transformation as given in eq. (2.10) with  = 0

on the initial (f, d3) conguration given in eqs.(2.1)(2.7), with m replaced by 1/2

(p,q). this

conguration is characterized in terms of the quantized charges p and q associated with the

f-strings and d-strings, the quantized charge n of the d3 brane, and arbitrary but given

asymptotic values 0 and 0 of the dilaton  and the axion , respectively. thus, we have

the following explicit conguration of the bound state ((f, d1), d3). the 5-form h5 remains

unchanged, as given in eq. (2.3). the einstein metric ds2 and the harmonic functions h

and h  all remain the same in forms as before, but the (m,n)-factor given in eq. (2.7),

which appears in the harmonic functions, is changed to

(p,q,n) = (p,q) + n2,

= (p  0 q)2 e0 + q2 e0 + n2,

(2.20)

which is also invariant under sl(2,z) as expected since n is inert under sl(2,z). the dilaton

is now

and the axion is

e = e0 h 
h h 

,

 =

0h  + (h  h )pqe0/ (p,q)

h 

.

in the above, we have introduced a third harmonic function h  as

h  = 1 +

(n2 + q2 e0)q3/(p,q,n)

r4

,

(2.21)

(2.22)

(2.23)

(p,q,n)20q3

where q3 = 1/2

0/(45). as expected, both the dilaton and the axion approach
their respective asymptotic values as r  . finally, the nsns and rr 3-form eld
strengths are

+ p n1

(p,q,n)h 2dh  dx2  dx3.

(2.24)

in the following section, we will study certain properties and the decoupling limit of this

conguration.

iii. properties and the decoupling limit of ((f, d1), d3)

by construction, we know that the conguration of ((f, d1), d3) given in the previous

section carries one (p, q)-string along the x1-axis per (2)2 area over the x2x3-plane. there

are p f-strings and q d-strings in the (p, q)-string. this non-threshold bound state also

carries the 5-form charge n.

we would like to mention that in constructing the sl(2,z) invariant ((f, d1), d3)

bound state solution of type iib theory, we have chosen the einstein-frame metric to be

asymptotically minskowski. however, since we are here studying strings and dp branes in

string theory, it would be natural to choose the string-frame metric to be asymptotically

minkowski instead. moreover, we need to calculate the tension for this bound state and

compare it with the corresponding worldvolume result where the string-frame metric is al-

ways chosen to be asymptotically minkowski in the context of string theory. also, usually in

discussing the so-called decoupling limit, the string-frame metric is chosen to be asymptoti-

cally minkowski. for these reasons, we re-express the explicit solution given in the previous

section in terms of such a choice for the asymptotic metric1. for this choice the 5-form

eld strength continues to be given by the expression in eq. (2.3). the dilaton and the

1actually there are some rationality behind the choice of the string-frame metric to be asymptot-

ically minkowski and relating such a choice to the sl(2,z) symmetry in type iib theory. we will

give a detail account of this along with other things in a separate paper.

9

axion also remains the same as given by eqs. (2.21) and (2.22), respectively. the same is
true for the harmonic functions h, h  and h  but with the replacements q3  e30/2q3,
n2 q3/(p,q,n)  n2e0/2q3/(p,q,n), and (n2 +q2 e0)q3/(p,q,n)  (n2 +q2)e0/2q3/(p,q,n)
in the respective harmonic functions. here the (p,q,n) is also changed to

(p,q,n) = (p  0 q)2 e0 + (q2 + n2) e0,

(3.1)

which is not manifestly sl(2,z) invariant now. apart from an overall constant factor e0/2

and the changes in the corresponding harmonic functions h and h  mentioned above, the

einstein-frame metric eq.(2.1) remains the same in form. the nsns and rr 3-form eld

strengths are now changed to

h (1)
3 = e0/2 (p  0 q) 1/2
3 = e0/2h0 (p  0 q)e0  q e0i 1/2
h (2)
(p,q,n)h 2dh  dx2  dx3,

(p,q,n)dh 1  dx0  dx1  e0q n 1
(p,q,n)dh 1  dx0  dx1

(p,q,n)h 2dh  dx2  dx3,

+e0p n1

(3.2)

where (p,q,n) is given by eq. (3.1).

we can now calculate the mass per unit 3-brane volume for this bound state with the

new einstein-frame metric using the generalized formula given in [1]. we therefore nd the

tension for the ((f, d1), d3) bound state as

t3(p, q, n) =

t 3
0

g qn2 + q2 + g2 (p  0q)2,

(3.3)

which, for 0 = 0, agrees precisely with what we obtained from the worldvolume study in

[3].

the expression for tension in (3.3) clearly shows that the spacetime ((f, d1), d3) bound

state should be identied with the bound state consisting of d3 branes carrying quantized

constant electric and magnetic elds given in [3] based on the worldvolume study. in other

words, the (p, q)-strings should be identied with the quantized electric and magnetic ux

lines. the quantized constant electric and magnetic elds are related to each other by the

sl(2,z) symmetry in the n = 4 sym theory on the worldvolume. this is directly linked to

10

the type iib sl(2,z) relating f-strings and d-strings in the (p, q)-string provided we identify

the gauge coupling and the -angle in the gauge theory with the string coupling and the

asymptotic value of the axion as

(3.4)

where g = e0 is the string coupling.

let us now study the decoupling limit for this ((f, d1), d3) bound state. under this

limit,

g2
ym = 2g = xed,

u =

 ,

  0,

(3.5)

we know that the modes propagating on the 3-brane worldvolume decouple from the modes

propagating in the bulk spacetime. also since   0 is a low-energy limit, the modes
propagating on the brane are just the massless ones of the open strings. therefore, d3

brane is now described by the n = 4 sym theory. it is also described by the elds in the
bulk. so now we have two equivalent descriptions for the d3 brane.

from the spacetime point of view, the decoupling limit tells us that we need to study

only the near-horizon geometry. under this limit, the dilaton, which denes the eective

string coupling ge, is given as,

ge  e = e0

1 + q2/n2

(1 + [q2 + e20(p  0q)2]/n2)1/2 ,

(3.6)

(3.7)

it is clear from (3.7) that x0, x1, x2 and x3 can be rescaled with the respective constant factors
such that the resulting metric reduces to ads5  s5. this metric describes equivalently

11

the near-horizon geometry of a simple d3 brane with 5-form ux n but with the string

coupling given by ge rather than the usual string coupling g = e0.

in the decoupling

limit, d-brane picture implies that this equivalent simple d3 brane is also described by the
n = 4 u(n) sym theory in 1 + 3 dimensions with the gauge coupling g2
corresponding  angle is now given by the value of the axion evaluated at the horizon, i.e.,

ym = 2ge (the

 = 2e = 2(pq + n20)/(n2 + q2)). in the same spirit of maldacena, we should have an

ads5/cf t4 correspondence here but with the string coupling ge and the axion e.

this equivalent simple d3 brane is taken as the eective vacuum conguration for

this correspondence. in analogy with (f, d3) bound state studied in [1], we may anticipate

that this eective vacuum corresponds to ((f, d1), d3) bound state. in order to provide

some evidence for this we notice that once the above coordinate rescalings are done, the

information about the (f, d1) bound states in the ((f, d1), d3) disappears in the resulting

metric. comparing the equivalent d3 branes with the usual d3 branes, we can see that the

only dierence is the string coupling constant. so the eects of these (f, d1) bound states

must be encoded in the eective string coupling ge given in eq. (3.6). the tension for this

equivalent simple d3 brane is nt 3

0 /ge. if we use the explicit expression for the ge, we nd

nt 3

ge

=

t 3

(3.8)

which, apart from the factor2 (1 + q2/n2)1, is nothing but the tension for the ((f, d1),

d3) bound state given in eq.(3.3). this indicates that the vacuum conguration for the

ads5/cf t4 correspondence in this case is the ((f, d1), d3) bound state.

on the sym side, ads5/cf t4 correspondence suggested above implies that the electric

and magnetic ux lines should disappear, too. as claimed, the gauge coupling is now given

as g2

ym = 2ge. using the explicit expression for ge as given by eq. (3.6), we have in the

linear approximation,

2we should point out that the appearance of this factor is not clear to us. we can only say that

it reects the presence of d-strings due to the s-duality performed on (f, d3) bound state.

where the second term in the square bracket represents the contribution from the magnetic

ux lines and the third term represents the contribution from the electric ux lines. in other

words, the eects of the electric and magnetic ux lines are absorbed into the gauge coupling

constant g2

ym = 2ge and they do not appear in the sym theory. therefore, we expect

that the superconformal symmetry is then restored. thus we have a consistent picture both

in the bulk and on the brane.

given the ads5/cf t4 correspondence with respect to the equivalent simple d3 brane, we

should have an ads5/cf t4 correspondence with respect to the ((f, d1), d3) conguration

with the string coupling ge and the gauge coupling g2

ym = 2ge. this in turn indicates

that maldacenas ads5/cf t4 correspondence holds true even for this non-trivial d3 brane

conguration but now with the string coupling ge rather than the usual string coupling g.

as in the case of (f, d3) bound state, the eective string coupling in eq.(3.6) is again

quantized but now in terms of integers p, q, n. from eq. (3.6) we nd that the f-strings in

((f, d1), d3) tend to decrease the coupling while the d-strings tend to increase it. therefore,

we may control the string coupling in the near-horizon region by adding or subtracting f-

strings (or d-strings).

iv. t-dual daughters of ((f, d1), d3)

once we have the space-time conguration for the non-threshold ((f, d1), d3) bound

state as given in section 2, many but nite number of its descendants can be obtained from

this by t-dualities, as described in detail in [1]. t-dualities can be applied either along the

transverse directions of the d3 brane in ((f, d1), d3) or along the longitudinal directions

of the d3 brane which includes the direction of the (f, d1)-strings. even though these

congurations can, in principle, be obtained directly from the equations of motion of type

iia or type iib supergravity theory, it would be very dicult to obtain them in practice if

we do not have these symmetries in hand. thre is no doubt that these congurations will

play important role in the formulation of the unique m- or u-theory.

in this section, we will rst discuss all possible non-threshold bound states which can be

obtained from ((f, d1), d3) by t-dualities3, following the table given below:

parallel transverse

dp d(p  1) d(p + 1)
f

w

f

w

f

ns5 ns5

kk

w

ns5

in this table w, f, ns5 and kk denote waves, fundamental strings, ns vebranes, and

kk monopoles, respectively, and they are associated with nsns elds. dp (1  p  8)
are the so-called d-branes and are associated with the rr elds.

then we will present explicit einstein-frame metric and dilaton for each of the non-

threshold ((f, dp), d(p + 2)) bound states for 2  p  5 where the well-known (dp, d(p
+ 2)) bound states are just special cases.

let us begin with the t-dualities along the transverse directions of the d3 brane. we

denote the coordinates along the d3 brane as x0, x1, x2, x3, and 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as its transverse

directions. we also denote (ti :7) as the t-duality along the i-th direction. according to
the above table, we have

((f, d1), d3) (t4 :7) ((f, d2), d4) (t5 :7) ((f, d3), d5) (t6 :7) ((f, d4), d6)
(t7 :7) ((f, d5), d7) (t8 :7) ((f, d6), d8).

(4.1)

we can t-dualize each of the above ((f, dp), d(p + 2)) for 1  p  6 along the
longitudinal directions of the original d3 brane, i.e., 1, 2 , 3 directions. we end up with

3we do not consider any dp brane resulting from d9 brane.

14

dierent bound states depending on whether we t-dualize along the 1 direction rst or

not. we demonstrate this on ((f, d1), d3) as examples. the other cases just follow. if we

t-dualize ((f, d1), d3) along the 1, i.e., the direction of (f, d1)-strings, we end up with

((w, d0), d2). if we t-dualize along the 3, we have ((f, d2), d2). we can now t-dualize

on ((f, d2), d2) along either 2 or 1. in the former case, we have ((f, d3), d1) while for

the later we have ((w, d1), d1). we can further t-dualize ((f, d3), d1) along the 1, we

end up with ((w, d2), d0).

in general, we have ((w, d(p  1)), d(p + 1)) if we t-dualize along 1 direction rst
on the ((f, dp), d(p + 2)) for 1  p  6. if we t-dualize rst along 3 instead, we have
((f, d(p + 1)), d(p + 1)). if we t-dualize on ((f, d(p + 1)), d(p + 1)) along either 1

or 2, we end up with ((w, dp), dp) or ((f, d(p + 2)), dp), respectively. further we can

t-dualize on ((f, d(p + 2)), dp) along 1, we end up with ((w, d(p + 1)), d(p  1)). we
summarize all the bound states obtained this way in the following table where the second

column indicates the common directions shared by the two d branes in the corresponding

bound state:

((w, d(p  1)), d(p + 1))

these are all possible non-threshold bound states which can be obtained from ((f, d1),

d3) by t-dualities. among these bound states, the well-known (dp, d(p +2)) bound states

for 0  p  6 [12] appear as special cases when the charges associated with either f-strings
or w-waves are set to zero. if we set the charge associated with the w-waves in ((w, dp),

dp) or the f-strings in ((f, d(p + 1)), d(p + 1)) for 1  p  6 to zero, we end up with

15

non-threshold (dp, dp) bound states 1  p  7 which appear to be new. as mentioned
above, the two dps share only (p 1) common directions. for those in the type iib theory,
we can apply sl(2,z) to obtain new bound states. for examples, from ((f, d3), d3), we can

have (((f, d1), d3), d3). one can also perform the consistency checks of the ads5/cf t4

correspondence for these two bound states. if we t-dualize (((f, d1), d3), d3) along the

common direction of the two d3s only, we have (((f, d2), d2), d2). if we now set the

charge associated with the f-strings to zero, we end up with a non-threshold bound state

(d2, d2, d2). the three d2s share only one common direction. it appears that this is the

only bound state consisting of three d-branes of same type. similarly, from ((f, d5), d5),

we can have (((f, d1), (ns5, d5)), (ns5, d5)). as we will demonstrate in a bit simpler

case of this, i.e., ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)), in [13] that the charges for the d5- and ns5-branes

are actually related to the charges for the f-strings and d-strings. this may suggest that

the formation of the sl(2,z) vebrane bound states [8,14,15] be a consequence of (f, d1)

bound states or (m, n)-strings. from ((f, d3), d5), we can have (((f, d1), d3), (ns5,

d5)) and so on. once we have these new bound states, we can again apply t-dualities to

obtain other new bound states, then s-dualities on those in type iib. we can continue this

process to obtain all possible non-threshold bound states by s- and t-dualities simply from

the original (f, d1)-strings. even though we are, at this point, unable to count how many of

these bound states are there, we believe that the total number of these bound states is nite

and may be related to the number of generators of the largest nite u-duality group in type

ii theory, i.e., e8(+8). after all, these bound states are obtained by repeated applications of

the s- and t-dualities. we speculate here that these bound states will form the multiplets

of the e8(+8) u-duality symmetry in the yet unknown m- or u-theory. we wish to come

back to provide more evidence for this elsewhere.

in closing this section we provide, as examples, the explicit einstein-frame metric and

the dilaton for each of the ((f, d(p  2)), dp) bound states for 3  p  7. the metric is

ds2 = e0/2(hh )1/4h (p3)/8hh 1(cid:16)(dx0)2 + (dx1)2(cid:17) + h 1(cid:16)(dx2)2 + (dx3)2(cid:17)

16

+h 1(cid:16)(dx4)2 +    + (dxp)2(cid:17) + dyidyii ,

with i = 1,   , 9  p; and the dilaton is

e = e0(h h)1/2h (7p)/4.

(4.2)

(4.3)

in the above, we have chosen the string-frame metric to be asymptotically minkowski. the

harmonic function h is

h = 


1 + qp

r7p ,

1  q7 ln r,

3  p  6,
p = 7,

(4.4)

with qp = 1/2

(p,q,n)e30/220/[(7  p)8p] and the harmonic functions h  and h  are

h  = h(n2h + q2) e0 + (p  0q)2 e0i 1

q2 h e0 + (p  0q)2 h  e0

h  =

(p,q,n),

q2 e0 + (p  0q)2 e0

.

(4.5)

other elds can be obtained from those given in section 3 for the ((f, d1), d3) conguration,

following the prescription given in [1]. in the above, the -factor continues to be given by

eq. (3.1) but now the integer p represents the quantized charge per (2)p1(p1)/2 area over
the x2    xp-plane carried by the f-strings, the integer q represents the quantized charge per
(2)2 area over the xp1xp-plane carried by the d(p  2) branes, and the integer n is the
quantized (p + 2)-form charge carried by the dp brane. the tension for each of these bound

states can be calculated by generalizing the mass per unit p-brane volume given in [16] in a

similar fashion as we did in [1]. the result is

tp(p, q, n) =

t p
0

g qn2 + q2 + g2(p  0q)2,

(4.6)

where the subscript p in tp and the superscript p in t p

0 should not be confused with the

integral charge p for the f-strings.

v. conclusion

to conclude, we have constructed in this paper the explicit space-time conguration for

the non-threshold ((f, d1), d3) bound state using the type iib sl(2,z) symmetry and

the known (f, d3) conguration. we have shown that the ((f, d1), d3) bound state is

identical to the bound state consisting of d3 branes carrying quantized constant electric and

magnetic elds. the (p, q)-strings are identical to the corresponding electric and magnetic,

or dyonic, ux lines. this also connects the type iib sl(2,z) symmetry in the bulk with the

sl(2,z) symmetry in the sym theory on the brane. we have studied the decoupling limit

of this bound state. we found that given the ads5/cf t4 correspondence of maldecena

with respect to a simple d3 brane and the usual string coupling, we should have a similar

correspondence with respect to this bound state but now with an eective string coupling.

this in turns indicates that maldacenas ads5/cf t4 correspondence holds true even for a

non-trivial d3 brane conguration with the corresponding eective string coupling rather

than the usual string coupling. we also found that d-strings in ((f, d1), d3) bound state

tend to increase the eective string coupling while the f-strings tend to decrease it. this

property may be used to control the string coupling in the bulk and the sym coupling on

the brane in the near-horizon region.

we have given the list of all possible descendants of this ((f, d1), d3) bound states

by t-dualities. unless there is an obstacle preventing us to perform t-dualities on these

bound states, we have predicted the existence of new non-threshold bound states (dp, dp)

for 1  p  7 where the two dps share only (p  1) common dimensions. we have also
predicted the existence of a seemingly unique non-threshold bound state (d2, d2, d2) in

type iia theory. the three d2s share only one common dimension. moreover, we have

presented the explicit congurations for the ((f, dp), d(p + 2)) bound states for 2  p  5.
using the type iib sl(2,z) symmetries on those newly obtained bound states, we can

construct further complicated bound states. then by t-dualities, we can have even more

bound states. we can probably exhaust all possible bound states by continuing this process.

18

all these bound states are bps ones, preserving one half of the spacetime supersymmetries.

these bound states can, in principle, be obtained from the equations of motion without the

need to use the s- and t-dualities. they are expected to appear in the uncompactied m-

or u-theory. we have conjectured that the total number of these bound states are nite and

these bound states will form multiplets of the u-duality group e8(+8) in the yet unknown

m- or u-theory.
