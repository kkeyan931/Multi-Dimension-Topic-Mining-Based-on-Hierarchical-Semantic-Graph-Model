introduction

it is well-known that all the fundamental interactions (electromagnetic, strong, weak and
gravitational) can be described in terms of gauge theories [1]. the quantization of gauge
theories is one of the most essential means to investigate the quantum properties of the
fundamental forces. the formalisms of hamiltonian (or canonical) and lagrangian (or
covariant) quantization of gauge theories present two dierent approaches to the quantum
description of dynamical systems [2].

the lagrangian quantization remains one of the most attractive approaches to gauge
theories quantization owing to its main advantage  the possibility of direct construc-
tion of the quantum eective action  allowing to avoid the usual long way of canonical
quantization with subsequent integration over momenta in the path integral, producing
as a result the vacuum expectation value of the s-matrix in the presence of external
sources. during last years covariant quantization schemes for arbitrary gauge theories are
intensively developed. the so-called sp(2)-covariant [3], supereld [4], triplectic [5] quan-
tization methods have been discovered. in addition, a further extension to an osp(1, 2)
symmetric quantization [6], allowing also for a supereld formulation [7], has been found.
these approaches are based on the principle of invariance under global brst-antibrst
symmetry [8, 9, 10, 11] and are connected with dierent o-shell realizations of this in-
variance principle in construction of greens functions.

the purpose of this paper is to introduce the reader into the sp(2)-covariant [3] and
triplectic [5] quantization methods and to present a modifed scheme of triplectic quanti-
zation [12].

2. sp(2)-covariant quantization

let us consider the sp(2)-quantization for general gauge theory described by the initial
classical action s0(a) of elds ai with grassmann parities (ai) = i. we assume that

1

s0(a) is invariant under gauge transformations ai = ri

(a),

s0,i(a)ri

(a) = 0,

(1)

where  are arbitrary functions, and ri
(a) are generators of gauge transformations. we
have also used dewitts condensed notations [13], where any index includes all particular
ones (space - time, index of internal group, lorentz index and so on). summation over re-
peated indices implies integration over continuous ones and usual summation over discrete
ones. we assume that the set {ri
(a)} is complete. as a consequence of the condition of
completeness, one can prove [14] that the algebra of generators has the following general
form,

ri

,j(a)rj

(a)  (1) ri

,j(a)rj

(a) = ri

(a)f 

(a)  s0,j(a)m ij

(a),

(2)

(a) are structure functions depending, in general, on the elds ai with the
(a) satises the

(a) = (1) f 

(a) and m ij

where f 
following properties of symmetry f 
conditions m ij

(a) = (1)ij m ji

(a) = (1) m ij

(a).

then it is necessary to introduce the total conguration space a,

a = (ai, b, c a,   ),

(a) = a.

(3)

here, c a are the sp(2)doublet of ghost (a = 1) and antighost (a = 2) elds with respect
to the index a, b are auxiliary elds and dots denote (for reducible theories) pyramids
of ghosts, antighosts and lagrange multipliers which are combined into irreducible repre-
sentations of the symplectic group sp(2) (see [3]). note that the general ingredients and
formulas have the same form both for irreducible and reducible cases.

to each eld a of the total conguration space one introduces three sets of anti-
aa) = a + 1 and a, ( a) = a, being sources of extended brst
elds 
transformations, namely, brst-transformations, antibrst-transformations and mixed
transformations respectively.

( , )a, called the extended antibrackets

(f, g)a

 (f  g) (1)((f )+1)((g)+1).

(4)

the derivatives with respect to elds are understood as acting from the right and those
with respect to antields, as acting from the left. there are the graded jacobi identities
for the extended antibrackets:

((f, g){a, h)b}(1)((f )+1)((h)+1) + cycl.perm.(f, g, h)  0,

(5)

where curly brackets denote symmetrization with respect to the indices a, b of the sp(2)
group.

in addition the operators v a, a are introduced

v a = ab

a = (1)a

(6)

(7)

where ab is the antisymmetric tensor for raising and lowering sp(2)indices

ab = ba,

12 = 1

ab = ab.

2

it can be readily established that the algebra of the operators (6), (7) has the form

{ab} = 0, {av b} + v {ab} = 0,

v {av b} = 0.

(8)

it is advantageous to introduce an operator a = a + (i/h)v a with the properties

for a boson functional s = s(, , ), we introduce the extended quantum master

(s, s)a + v as = ihas

s|= =h=0 = s0(a).

(10)

(11)

the generating equation for the bosonic functional s is a set of two equations.

it
should be veried that these equations are compatible. the simplest way to establish this
fact is to rewrite the extended master equations in the equivalent form of linear dierential
equations

a exp(cid:26) i

h

s(cid:27) = 0.

(12)

due to the properties (9) of the operators a, we immediately establish the compatibility
of the equations.

with the help of action (10) we next dene the vacuum functional z(0) by the rule

z(0) = z d d d  d da exp(cid:26) i

(13)

where we have introduced a set of auxiliary elds aa, (aa) = a + 1,, a, (a) = a
and a bosonic functional f = f () xing a gauge in the theory.

an important property of the integrand in (13) is its invariance under the follow-
ing global transformations (which, for its part, is a consequence of the extended master
equation for s)

a = aaa,



 a = aba

aa = a

a = 0,

aa = abab,

(14)
where a is an sp(2)doublet of constant anticommuting grassmann parameters. these
transformations realize the extended brst transformations in the space of the variables
, , ,  and .

the existence of these transformations enables one to establish the independence of
the vacuum functional from the choice of gauge. indeed, suppose zf  z(0). we shall
change the gauge f  f + f .
in the functional integral for zf +f we make the
above-mentioned change of variables with the parameters chosen as

then we nd

a =

zf = zf +f

(15)

(16)

and therefore the s-matrix is gauge-independent by virtue of the equivalence theorem
[15].

3. triplectic quantization

the main idea of the triplectic quantization proposed by batalin, marnelius and semikha-
tov [5] was to consider elds aa, which appear in the sp(2)-method, as anticanonical
partners to the antields a about extended antibrackets dened by the rule:
 a (cid:19)  (f  g) (1)((f )+1)((g)+1).

(f, g)a  (cid:18) f

+ ab f
ab

(17)

g

g


aa

a

the new extended antibrackets have properties which formally coincide with the proper-
ties of the extended antibrackets within the sp(2)formalism (see, for example, (5)). in
an anloguous way the operators v a, a are introduced by

v a =

1

2(cid:18)ab 

ab


 a

 (1)aaa l

a(cid:19),

a = (1)a l
a




aa

+ (1)a+1ab l
aa


 a

.

it can be readily established that the algebra of operators (18), (19) has the form

v {av b} = 0, {ab} = 0,

av b + v ba = 0.

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

note that the denition (18) of the new operators v a diers from the sp(2)case (see
eq.(6)). as a consequence, formulas (21) are valid without symmetrization in the indices
a and b in comparison with the sp(2)formalism.
it is also usefully to introduce an
operator a = a + (i/h)v a with the properties

{a b} = 0.

the vacuum functional in this approach is dened by the rule

z(0) = z dddd d exp(cid:26) i

h

(s + x)(cid:27)

(22)

(23)

where the boson functional s = s(, , , ; h) satises the following master equations

or, equivalently,

a exp(cid:26) i

h

s(cid:27) = 0.

1
2

(s, s)a + v as = ihas,

(24)

(25)

and the boson functional x = x(, , , , ; h) is a hypergauge xing action depending
on new variables a, (a) = a and satisng the following quantum equations:

1
2

(x, x)a  v ax = ihax,

(26)

4

which diers from eq.(25) by the opposite sign of the v-term.

the vacuum functional (23) possesses the important property of invariance under the

following global transformations

g = (g, s + x)aa + 2av ag,

(27)

where g denotes the complete set of variables and a is an sp(2) doublet of constant
anticommuting grassmann parameters. these transformations realize in the triplectic
quantization the extended brst transformations in the space of the variables , , ,
a and .

if we consider the transformations (27) with a depending on g and  it is not dicult

to obtain the following representation for the vacuum functional

z(0) = z dg exp(cid:26) i

h(cid:20)s + x  ih(a, s)a + ih(a, x)a + 2ihv aa(cid:21)(cid:27)

let us make an additional change of variables in the integral (28)

this change gives

g =

1
2

(g, fa)a.

z(0) = z dg exp(cid:26) i

h
+2ihv aa +

[s + x  ih(a, s)a + ih(a, x)a +

1
2

(s, fa)a +

1
2

(x, fa)a  ihafa](cid:27)

if we identify

then we obtain

fa(g) 

2h
i

a(g, )

z(0) = z dg exp(cid:26) i

h(cid:20)s + x + x(cid:21)(cid:27)

where the following notation has been introduced

x = (x, fa)a  v afa  ihafa.

one can now check (for details, see [5])

(x, x)a  v ax = ihax

provided fa is chosen to have the following form

fa = ab(cid:26)(x, y )b  v by  ihby(cid:27).

(28)

(29)

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

(34)

(35)

on the other hand, any small admissible variation of hypergauge xing action x in
eq. (23) has to satisfy eqs. (34). it means that one can compensate for a variation of
hypergauge xing action in the vacuum functional by a suitable choice of fa in (29) (or
y in (35)). therefore, the vacuum functional (23) does not depend on the gauge. we see
that from the formal point of view the triplectic quantization [5] possesses all remarkable
features of the sp(2)method.

5

4. modied triplectic quantization

notice that in its original version [5], the classical action s0(a) does not provide a solution
of the master equations (25) because of the special structure of operators v a (18) and
cannot be considered as boundary condition to the master equations. on the other hand
all known schemes of covariant quantization and existence theorems for them are based on
the fact that all information of initial classical system is introduced through the boundary
condition. this point should be considered as essential part of covariant quantizations.

we will show that it is possible to modify the original form of triplectic quantization
[5] preserving all attractive features of the method and allowing to encode in the usual
way any information about the classical system with the help of the boundary condition
to the master equations.

we use the denition of extended antibrackets given in (17). in solving the functional
equations determining the eective action we make use of the operators a, v a and u a

a = (1)a l

v a = ab

aa

+ (1)a+1ab l

,

,

u a = (1)a+1aa l

a .

(36)

(37)

(38)

notice that the operators a have already appeared both within the scheme of triplec-
tic quantization [5] and, virtually, within the scheme of supereld quantization [4]. even
though the operators v a in eq. (37) dier from the corresponding operators of the triplectic
quantization, they coincide, at the same time, with the operators applied in the frame-
work of the sp(2) method [3]. the use of the operators u a in eq. (38) (an analog of
these operators has been introduced in the method of supereld quantization) exhibits
an essentially new feature as compared to both the sp(2)method and the old triplectic
quantization.

one readily establishes the following algebra of the operators (36)(38):

v {av b} = 0, u {au b} = 0,

{ab} = 0,
{av b} + v {ab} = 0, {au b} + u {ab} = 0,
v au b + u bv a = 0, av b + v ba + au b + u ba = 0.

(39)

apart from a, v a, u a, we also introduce the operators a  a + (i/h)v a,
a 
a  (i/h)u a. with the above mentioned properties it follows that the algebra of these
operators has the form

{a b} = 0,

{a b} = 0,

{a b} + {a b} = 0.

(40)

let us denote by s = s(, , , ) the quantum action, corresponding to the initial
classical theory with the action s0 = s0(a), and dened as a solution of the following
master equations:

with the standard boundary condition

a exp(cid:26) i

h

s(cid:27) = 0.

s|= =h=0 = s0.

6

(41)

(42)

let us further dene the vacuum functional as the following functional integral (g =
(, , , , )):

z = z dg exp(cid:26) i

h (cid:16)s + x + 

aaaa(cid:17)(cid:27) ,

(43)

where x = x(, , , , ) is a bosonic functional depending on the new variables a,
() = a, which serve as gauge-xing parameters. we require that the functional x
satises the following master equation:

a exp(cid:26) i

h

x(cid:27) = 0.

(44)

notice that the generating equations determining the quantum action s in eq. (41) and the
gauge-xing functional x in eq. (44) dier  along with the vacuum functional z in eq. (43)
 from the corresponding denitions applied in the method of triplectic quantization [5].
one can readily obtain the simplest solution of eq. (44) determining the gauge-xing

functional x

x =   a 
=   a 

f

a! a 
a! a 

f

1
2
1
2

abu au bf =

abaa

2f
ab bb,

(45)

where f = f () is a bosonic functional depending only on the elds a. as a straight-
forward exercise, one makes sure that the functional x in eq. (45) does satisfy eq. (44). if
we further demand that the quantum action s does not depend on the elds a, then the
functional (43) becomes exactly the vacuum functional of the sp(2) quantization scheme
[3].

let us consider a number of properties inherent in the present scheme of triplectic
quantization. in the rst place, the vacuum functional (43) is invariant under the following
transformations:

g = (g, s + x)aa + a(v a + u a)g,

(46)

where a is an sp(2) doublet of constant anticommuting parameters. the transformations
(46) play the role of the transformations of extended brst symmetry, realized on the
space of the variables g = (, , , , ).

consider now the question of gauge dependence in the case of the vacuum functional

z (43). any admissible variation x should satisfy the equations

(x, x)a  u ax = ihax.

(47)

it is convenient to consider an sp(2)doublet of operators sa(x), dened by the rule

and possessing the properties

(x, f )a  sa(x)  f,

s{a(x) sb}(x) = s{a(cid:18)1

2

(x, x)b}(cid:19) ,

(48)

(49)

which follow from the generalized jacobi identities (5). consequently, eq. (47) can be
represented in the form

qa(x)x = 0,

7

(50)

where we have introduced an sp(2)doublet of nilpotent anticommuting operators qa,
dened by the rule qa(x) = sa(x)  ih a, q{a(x) qb}(x) = 0. then any functional of
the form

x =

1
2

ab qa(x) qb(x)y,

(51)

with an arbitrary bosonic functional y , is a solution of eq. (50). moreover, by analogy
with the theorems proved in ref. [3], one establishes the fact that any solution of eq. (50)
 vanishing when all the variables in x are equal to zero  has the form (51), with a
certain bosonic functional y .

let us denote by zx  z the value of the vacuum functional (43) corresponding to
the gauge condition chosen as a functional x. in the vacuum functional zx+x we rst
make the change of variables (46), with a = a(g, ), and then, accompanying it with a
subsequent change of variables  = (g, ya)a,
(ya) = 1, with ya = iha(g, ), we
arrive at

zx+x = z dg exp(cid:26) i

h(cid:18)s + x + x + x1 + 

aaaa(cid:19)(cid:27) .

in eq. (52) we have used the notation

x1 = 2(cid:18)(x, ya)a  u aya  ihaya(cid:19) = 2 qa(x)ya.

let us choose the functional ya in the form

ya =

1
4

ab qby ,

(y ) = 0.

then, representing x as in eq. (51), and identifying y = y , we nd that

zx+x = zx,

(52)

(53)

(54)

(55)

i.e., the vacuum functional (and also the s matrix) does not depend on the choice of
gauge.

5. discussion

the reader may prot by considering the original version of triplectic quantization [5] as
compared to the modied scheme, proposed in [12]. thus, both versions are based on
extended brst symmetry. both versions apply the vacuum functional and the s matrix
not depending on the choice of gauge. both versions implement the idea of separate treat-
ment of the quantum action and the gauge-xing functional, based each on appropriate
master equations. the principal distinctions concern a dierent form of these equations
as well as a dierent form of the vacuum functional. the modication of the generat-
ing equations [5] permits incorporating the information contained in the initial classical
action by means of the corresponding boundary conditions. in contrast to the original
version [5], the classical action provides a solution of the modied master equation. thus,
one establishes a connection with the previous schemes of covariant quantization. in par-
ticular, one easily reveals the fact of equivalence with the sp(2) quantization, by means
of explicit realization of the corresponding class of boundary condition. in the original
version of triplectic quantization, however, these questions still remained open.

8

another distinction of the two triplectic quantization schemes is connected with the
explicit structure of the corresponding master equations. thus, the original version [5] of
triplectic quantization dened the generating equations for the quantum action and the
vacuum functional, using the operators

v a
bm =

1

2  ab

ab


 a

+ aa(1)a+1 l

a! =

1
2

(u a + v a).

(56)

the use of the generating equations determining the quantum action with the help of
the operators v a
bm leads to the following characteristic feature of the triplectic quantization
[5]: the classical action of the initial theory, dened as a limit of the quantum action at h 
0 and  =  =  = 0, does not satisfy the generating equations of the method. in turn,
the proofs of the existence theorems for the generating equations in all known methods of
lagrangian quantization are based on the fact that the initial classical action is a solution
of the corresponding master equations. moreover, from the viewpoint of the supereld
quantization [4], which applies operators v a, u a, whose component representation is

v a = ab
ab


 a

 ja




aa

,

(57)

u a = (1)a+1aa l

a + (1)aaba l

ab

(with ja being the sources to the elds a), the operators (56) have no precise geometrical
meaning, whereas the v a and u a in eq. (57) serve as generators of supertranslations 
in superspace spanned by superelds and superantields  along additional (grassmann)
coordinates. in turn, the operators v a (37) and u a (38) can be considered as limits (at
ja = 0, a = 0) of the operators (57), which possess a clear geometrical meaning.

the present modied scheme of triplectic quantization enjoys every attractive feature
of the quantization [5]: the theory possesses extended brst transformations; the vacuum
functional and the s matrix do not depend on the choice of the gauge-xing functional;
there exists such a choice of the gauge-xing functional and solutions of the generating
equations that reproduces the results of the sp(2) method.
