abstract

in this experimental research, we use known topological recursion relations in genera-
zero, -one, and -two to compute the n-point descendant gromov-witten invariants of ip1
for arbitrary degrees and low values of n. the results are consistent with the virasoro
conjecture and also lead to explicit computations of all hodge integrals in these genera.
we also derive new recursion relations for simple hurwitz numbers similar to those of
graber and pandharipande.

introduction

it is well-known that the intersection theory on the compactied moduli space mg,n of stable
n-pointed genus-g curves, or equivalently the two-dimensional pure gravity, is governed by an
integrable kdv hierarchy [26, 38]. more precisely, the kdv hierarchy allows one to compute
recursively the intersection numbers of tautological divisors on mg,n, for arbitrary g and n,
in terms of two basic invariants in genus-0 and genus-1. physically, it means the following:
it is a common and useful practice to perturb a given quantum eld theory by introducing
into the action couplings to physical operators and to study the perturbed partition function
which becomes the generating function for the correlators of the original theory. for example,
in a topological string theory on a target space v , the physical operators are the cohomology
classes a of v and their gravitational descendants m,a, m  zz1. in this case, one considers
a perturbation by

xm=0 xah (v )

ta
m m,a

(1.1)

where 0,a represents the primary eld associated with the cohomology class a itself. the
m are said to form the coordinates on the so-called large phase space2. in this
parameters ta
setting, the kdv structure implies that the partition function of the perturbed topological
string theory on a point target space, in which the puncture or identity operator is the only
primary eld, is a  -function of the hierarchy and the  -function is uniquely xed by the string
equation.

it was soon realized that the statement of the integrable structure can be rephrased in terms
of certain dierential operators on the large phase space which annihilate the  -function. it
turns out that these operators furnish a representation of a subsector of the virasoro algebra,
and thus the kdv hierarchy of the intersection theory is also known as the virasoro constraints
[6].

one immediate generalization of the above picture is to introduce more primary elds
by coupling the two-dimensional topological gravity to topological eld theories. for example,
coupling the topological minimal models to topological gravity leads to d < 1 topological string
theories which are governed by w -algebra constraints, generalizing the virasoro algebra. a
more interesting and perhaps more physical way is to consider topological string theories on
more general non-trivial target spaces. this approach has led to physical means of studying the
gromov-witten (gw) invariants, of which the subject of quantum cohomology is a subset,
on fano and calabi-yau manifolds. such physical models describe the intersection theory,
sometimes called the gravitational quantum cohomology, on some suitably dened moduli
spaces of stable holomorphic maps from riemann surfaces to target spaces [3, 4, 27, 31].
based on the previous examples, should one expect some kind of an integrable structure to
govern the intersection theory in these cases as well?

2similarly, the small phase space refers to a space of deformations by only the primary elds; i.e. the subspace

ta
m = 0, m > 0, of the large phase space.

1

through a series of papers [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 24], it has been indeed conjectured that
there should exist a certain integrable hierarchy which underlies the gravitational quantum
cohomology and which manifests itself again in terms of a set of dierential operators forming
a half branch of the virasoro algebra:

[ln, lm] = (n  m)ln+m, n, m  1 .

(1.2)

this conjecture is now referred to as the virasoro conjecture and has been proven up to genus-
1 by mathematicians for manifolds satisfying certain conditions [7, 32, 33]; in particular, for
complex projective spaces ipn. historically, this conjecture is based on the discovery of a
matrix model for the topological string theory on ip1 [9, 10, 24]; the ward identities for the
matrix model form a virasoro algebra. the authors of [10] have checked for a few cases that
the intersection numbers on the moduli space of stable maps indeed satisfy the constraints
implied by their conjecture. despite some curious matchings, there is yet no complete proof3
of their conjecture even for ip1.

in this paper, we take a retrograding step towards attempting to unravel the mystery
of the virasoro constraints for ip1. at rst sight, this example appears to be the simplest
generalization of the pure gravity case, but it turns out that the only interesting gw invariants
for ip1 are the gravitational descendants. the reason is that the only primary elds of the
theory are the identity and the second cohomology class which can be eliminated via the
puncture and divisor equations [24, 38]. we thus cannot obtain any nontrivial information
by restricting our attention to the small phase space, as was done in [12, 13], and we would
need to consider various descendant gw-invariants to study whether there exist any possible
constraints on the theory. important ingredients in our computations of the gw-invariants
are the known topological recursion relations (trrs) in genera-zero, -one and -two.

incidentally, the relation between the trrs and the virasoro constraints are not clear,
even in the present case of ip1.
in the pure gravity case, the virasoro constraints, or the
kdv hierarchy, completely determine all the correlators in all genera in terms of h0,00,00,0i0
and h1,0i1, and there is no need for additional trrs; the trrs are thus redundant for a
point target space. for higher dimensional target spaces, however, the virasoro constraints
by themselves are not powerful enough to determine all the correlators and require the help
of additional trrs. in fact, it is not known whether the virasoro constraints, even if they
were true, together with various trrs, would be able to determine all the correlators for a
non-trivial target space. interestingly, for ip1, the positive modes of the virasoro constraints
are not needed to compute all the descendant gw-invariants up to genus-2. that is, the
trrs of [11, 17, 38], together with the l1 and l0 constraints4, are enough to compute all
the correlators in genus-zero, -one, and -two. at least in these low genera, it thus seems that
the virasoro constraints for ip1 are redundant, and indeed, we have checked for many of the

3that is, except for a point and calabi-yau varieties of dimension greater than or equal to three.
4these two constraints are proven to hold for all manifolds. the l1 constraint is the string equation of

witten [38], and l0 the equation of hori [24] combining the dilaton, divisor and dimension equations.

gw-invariants which we have obtained via trrs that they actually do satisfy the constraints.
before we proceed, it is perhaps necessary to clarify the nature of our work, so as to align
the readers line of thinking with our own. the philosophy of this paper is not to prove any
parts of the virasoro conjecture. instead, we admittedly take an un-innovative approach to
computing the descendant gw-invariants of ip1 by using the available topological recursion
relations, and the numbers that we thus obtain are independent of the virasoro conjecture.
since a genus-g recursion relation involves lower genus contributions, a mistake in genera-
zero and -one would propagate through any subsequent computations in higher genera. we
therefore check many5 of our results by verifying that they satisfy the virasoro constraints in
genera-zero and -one, which are rigorously proven to hold [7, 32, 33]. based on those numbers,
we are able to compute the genus-2 gw-invariants containing up to three arbitrary descendant
elds, and we again check that they satisfy many of the genus-2 virasoro constraints. as the
virasoro constraints in genus-2 are conjectural, our verication provides a minor support for
the claim.

this paper is organized as follows: we rst compute the descendant gw-invariants and
the hodge integrals in genera-zero, -one, and -two just by using known topological recursion
relations. in 3, we use these results to check the virasoro conjecture by explicitly checking
that the correlators satisfy the constraints. we also comment on the higher-genus cases and on
the trrs of eguchi and xiong [13]. in 4, which is independent of other sections, we derive
new recursion relations for simple hurwitz numbers in genera-zero and -one by using trrs
as well as by applying the virasoro constraints discussed in the previous sections. the paper
concludes with speculations and open questions regarding the relation between the trrs and
the virasoro constraints.

 we call m the degree6 of the descendant m,.

 following the physics nomenclature, we sometimes call the n-point descendant invariant

hm1,1    mn,nig an n-point correlation function, or simply an n-point functions.

 technically, an n-point gw-invariant hm1,1    mn,nig is a sum of gromov-witten
invariants hm1,1    mn,nig, d in various degrees with coecients in the novikov ring of
ip1, but since each correlator receives a contribution from only one specic degree, we
will often use hn1,1    nk,k ig and hn1,1    nk,kig, d interchangeably. the degree d
of the non-vanishing gw-invariant can be worked out easily from the dimension of the
virtual fundamental class [mg,n(ip1, d)]vir.

 many terminologies from algebraic geometry are used in this paper without explanation.
we will pretend that we know what they mean and refer the reader to the available
references for their denitions [5, 18, 23].

2 computations of the descendant gw-invariants

in this section, we compute the descendant gw-invariants of ip1 in genera-zero, -one and
-two by using the topological recursion relations of witten [38], eguchi-hori-xiong [11] and
getzler [17]. in general, a trr in genus-g involves lower genus gw-invariants; as a result, the
computational usefulness of a trr depends on the knowledge of the lower genus invariants.
we thus proceed systematically from descendant gw-invariants in genus-0 to those in genus-2.

2.1 properties of the descendant gw-invariants

the descendant gw-invariants, also known as the gravitational correlators, satisfy certain
topological axioms which will be used throughout this paper. in this subsection, we briey
review these properties and refer the reader to [5] for details.

let mg,n(v, ) be the compactied moduli space of stable holomorphic maps f :   v of
genus-g n-pointed riemann surfaces  to a smooth projective variety v , such that f[] =  
h2(v, zz). let  : mg,n+1(v, )  mg,n(v, ) be the universal curve with n natural sections

i : mg,n(v, )  mg,n+1(v, )

(2.1)

associated with the n marked points. the tautological line bundle li  mg,n(v, ) is dened
to be 
i , where  is the relative dualizing sheaf of , and we denote its rst chern class,
called the tautological -class, by i.

let ev : mg,n(v, )  v n be the evaluation map dened by

ev : [f : (, z1, . . . , zn)  v ]  mg,n(v, ) 7 (f (z1), . . . , f (zn))  v n.

(2.2)

6this degree should not be confused with the degree of a stable map in mg,n(ip1, d).

4

then, the descendant gw-invariant is dened to be

hm1,1    mn,nig,  :=z[mg,n(v,)]vir

m1

1

   mn

n  ev(1      n).

(2.3)

these invariants satisfy certain axioms which are generalizations of those occurring in the
pure gravity case, i.e. in the case of a point target space. specializing to the case of ip1, they
are:

 degree axiom. the gw-invariant hm1,1    mn,nig, d vanishes if

2d + 2g  2 + n 6=

(mi + i),

nxi

(2.4)

where d  zz0 is the degree of the map, i.e. f[] = d  where  generates the eective
cycles of h2(ip1, zz).

 string axiom. for either n + 2g  3 or d > 1, n  1,

h0,0m1,1    mn,nig, d =

nxi=1

hm1,1    mi1,i1mi1,imi+1,i+1    mn,nig, d.

(2.5)

 divisor axiom. for either n + 2g  3 or d > 1, n  1,

h0,1m1,1    mn,nig, d =

nxi

hm1,1    mi1,i1mi1,1+imi+1,i+1    mn,nig, d

+ dhm1,1    mn,nig, d.

(2.6)

 dilaton axiom. for either n + 2g  3 or d > 1, n  1,

h1,0m1,1    mn,nig, d = (2g  2 + n)hm1,1    mn,nig, d.

(2.7)

in degree zero, there are the following exceptional cases:

h0,00,a0,bi0, 0 = zip1

a  b

h0,1i1, 0 = 

1
24

the dimension of the virtual fundamental class is

h1,0i1, 0 =

1
12

vdim(mg,n(ip1, d)) = 2(g  1) + 2d + n .

thus, from the degree axiom, we see that the non-vanishing gw-invariants are of the form

hn1,0    nk,0 m1,1    m,1ig, d

5

where

2(g  1) + 2d + k =

ni +

kxi=1

mi .

xi=1

in particular, the only non-vanishing gw-invariants that do not contain the tautological -
classes are:

h0,10,1    0,1i0, 1 = 1 and h0,00,00,1i0, 0 = 1

in genus-0 and

h0,1i1, 0 = 

1
24

in genus-1. all other non-vanishing gw-invariants thus contain the tautological -classes, and
we call them descendant gw-invariants.

2.2 genus-zero

topological recursion relations (trrs) generally follow from the equality of the tautological
classes with boundary classes on the moduli space mg,n, and they are used to reduce the
degree of the descendants inside correlators. the trrs for the generating functions of the
gw-invariants of ip1 are given by

hhm1,1m2,2m3,3ii0 = hhm11,10,0ii0hh0,1m2,2m3,3ii0

+ hhm11,10,1ii0hh0,0m2,2m3,3ii0 .

(2.8)

we can compute the n-point descendant gw-invariants by using this relation and other topo-
logical axioms; the numbers that we compute are thus independent of the virasoro con-
jecture. we will later use these information to test numerically the virasoro conjecture in
genus-2.

we start with the two-point functions hm1,1m2,2i0 by noticing that there are two ways
of reducing the invariants hm1,1m2,20,0i0. that is, we can either use the genus-0 trr (2.8)
to reduce the degree of m1,1 or use the string equation to reduce the invariant into a sum of
two-point functions:

hm11,1m2,2i0 + hm1,1m21,2i0 = hm11,10,0i0h0,1m2,2 i0 + hm11,10,1i0h0,0m2,2i0

(2.9)

the two-point functions of the form hm,0,i0 can be computed by using the trr of eguchi-
hori-xiong (b.4) and are given by (b.7). now, (2.9) gives us a set of recursive relations among
the two-point functions. for example, dene

x(m) = h2m1,02d2m+1,0i0, d

and

y (m) = h2m,02d2m,0i0, d .

(2.10)

then, we obtain the relations

y (m) = x(m) + a(m, d)

and x(m) = y (m  1) + a(d  m + 1, d) ,

(2.11)

6

where

and

a(m, d) =

(2cm1  1/m)(2cdm)

m(m  1)!2(d  m)!2

cm =

.

mxk=1

we can solve for x(m) and y (m) recursively and obtain

h2m1,02d2m+1,0i0, d = x(m) = 2

cd
d!2 +

h2m,02d2m,0i0, d = y (m) = 2

mxk=2f1(k, d) ,
mxk=1

1(k, d) ,

cd
d!2 +

where

1(k, d) = a(k, d)  a(d  k + 1, d) ,

(2.12)

(2.13)

(2.14)

(2.15)

f1(k, d) = a(d  k + 1, d)  a(k  1, d) ,

and the summation is set to zero whenever the lower limit exceeds the upper limit. other
two-point functions are similarly determined, and we summarize the results in appendix b.
the one-point descendants can be obtained from the two-point functions by using the string
equation.

the genus-0 trr for the three-point gw-invariants are

hm1,1m2,2m3,3i0, d =( hm11,10,0i0, dh0,1 m2,2 m3,3i0, d

hm11,10,1i0, d + 1

h0,0 m2,2 m3,3i0, d  1

2

2

where the degree d of the holomorphic maps must satisfy

if m1 + 1 is odd,
if m1 + 1 is even.
(2.16)

2d + 1 =

d =

3xi=1

mi +

i ,

3xi=1

m1 + 1  1

2

and d = d  d .

(2.17)

by the divisor axiom and the string equation, we can further manipulate the above quantities
to produce two-point functions. for example, we have

h0,1 m2,2m3,3i0 = dhm2,2 m3,3i0 + hm21,2+1 m3,3i0 + hm2,2 m31,3+1i0 . (2.18)

hence, using the previous computations of the two-point invariants, we can now also compute
arbitrary three-point functions, whose closed-form expressions are possible but not instructive.
we thus compute them numerically using a computer program and tabulate some of the
invariants in appendix c.1.

similarly and unfortunately, we have reduced the problem of computing the higher-point
invariants to an exercise in computer programming. we dierentiate the trr (2.8) repeatedly

7

and use the divisor, dilaton, and string equations to reduce the number and degrees of the elds
appearing in the right-hand side of equation. using this simple but tedious approach, we have
completed a computer program which computes up to 7-point functions of arbitrary degrees
and have included a few examples in appendix c.

2.3 genus-one

because there exists another trr [38] in genus-1, it is also possible to compute the genus-1
descendant gw-invariants. for ip1, the relation has the following simple form:

hhn,ii1 = hhn1,0,0ii0hh0,1ii1 + hhn1,0,1ii0hh0,0ii1 +

1
12

hhn1,0,00,1ii0 .

(2.19)

setting all t

m = 0, (2.19) yields

h2d+1,0i1, d = ( 1

h2d,1i1, d = 

12 d!2 (cd  2dcd1  1)
1
12
1  2d
24 d!2 .

for d 6= 0 ,
for d = 0 , and

(2.20)

to compute the two-point functions7, we dierentiate (2.19) with respect to a descendant

variable t

m and get an equation which is valid in the large phase space:

hhn,m,ii1 = hhn1,m,0,0ii0hh0,1ii1 + hhn1,0,0ii0hh0,1m,ii1 + hhn1,m,0,1ii0hh0,0ii1

+ hhn1,0,1ii0hh0,0m,ii1 +

1
12

hhn1,m,0,00,1ii0 .

(2.21)

at zero couplings, it becomes

hn,m,i1 = 

1
24

hn1,m,0,0i0 + hn2,i0h0,1m,i1

+ hn1,0,1i0hm1,i1 +

1
12

hn1,m,0,00,1i0 .

(2.22)

which contains only genus-0 invariants and genus-1 one-point functions, upon using the divisor
axiom. closed-form answers for these two-point functions are again possible, but they are not
perhaps so illuminating. we thus omit the explicit expressions in the paper but list some of
their values in appendix c.2.

it is clear that the higher-point genus-1 descendant gw-invariants can be similarly com-
puted in terms of the genus-0 and the lower-point genus-1 invariants by repeatedly dieren-
tiating (2.19). we have again implemented the algorithm into a computer program which
computes up to 5-point functions of arbitrary degrees, and we have also tabulated a collection
of our results up to 3-point functions in appendix c.2.

7there are of course a few obvious ones that one can compute by using the divisor and string equations. for

example, one can show that h0,10,1i1 = 0, h1,00,1i1 = 1/24, h1,01,0i1 = 1/12.

8

2.4 genus-two

combined with our previous computations, we now use a genus-2 trr [17] to compute up to
3-point descendant gw-invariants in arbitrary degrees. getzlers trr (a.3) directly leads to
the one-point functions, and their derivatives yield the desired two- and three-point functions
(see appendix c.3). his trrs for two-point functions, on the other hand, seem somewhat
mysterious to us, and we were not able to produce the gw-invariants which satisfy the topo-
logical axioms and the genus-2 virasoro constraints.

2.5 hodge integrals

this section marks the end of our torture with programming.

let ,  and  be as in 2.1. the hodge bundle e =  over mg,n(v, ) is a rank-g
sheaf of holomorphic sections of h 0(, ), where  is the canonical sheaf of . the i
classes are dened to be the i-th chern classes of the hodge bundle, and a generalization of
the gromov-witten integral of the form (2.3) including the -classes is called a hodge integral.
in [15], faber and pandharipande have found a set of dierential operators that annihilate the
generating function for hodge integrals. in principle, their theorem allows one to compute the
hodge integrals on the moduli space of stable maps in terms of the descendant gromov-witten
invariants. in practice, however, it is dicult to compute the gw-potential in the large phase
space, and it is precisely for this reason that some kind of an integrable structure such as the
virasoro constraints is desirable in studying the intersection theory. it is, however, often the
case that the virasoro constraints alone are not strong enough to determine the gw-invariants
on non-trivial target spaces. in this paper, we have taken a dierent approach to computing
the invariants, and we have seen that for ip1, the known topological recursion relations allow
one to compute all the gw-invariants up to genus-2. using these results, the work of faber
and pandharipande completely determines all the hodge integrals for ip1 up to genus-2.

the expressions of the dierential equations for ip1 are particularly simple:

illustrations, we have implemented our computer program to compute this and other arbitrary
hodge integrals involving up to two-descendants in genus-1. ( see appendix c.2 for a partial
list.) the genus-2 cases are similarly treated: the  = 1 relations in (2.23) lead to 1 hodge
integrals, and the mumfords relation 22 = 2
1 yields the 2 integrals. since the algorithm is
obvious by now, we do not explicitly carry out the computations.

the virasoro constraints are actually proven to hold in genus-0 [32], and we have numerically
checked that the constraints (3.5) are indeed satised for roughly 5000 cases containing up to
four-point functions. this test makes it fairly certain that our computer generated answers of
the genus-0 gw-invariants are correct.

3.2 genus-one

since ip1 has a semi-simple quantum cohomology, the virasoro conjecture is true also in genus-1
[7, 33]. in this case, the virasoro constraints take the form

0 = zn,1 =

m hhn+m,0ii1 + 2 (m, n) t0

m hhn+m1,1ii1 + (m, n) t1

xm=0(cid:2)(m, n) t0

m hhn+m,1ii1(cid:3)

(3.6)

and they yield constraints that are similar to (3.5). using the genus-0 and genus-1 descendant
invariants that were computed in 2.2 and 2.3, we have checked that over 7000 virasoro
constraints which involve up to 4-point genus-1 gw-invariants are satised.

11

3.3 genus-two

the status of the virasoro constraints in genus-2 is still conjectural, and it would be interesting
to see if the gw-invariants which are obtained from either rigorously derived trrs or algebraic
geometry actually satisfy the virasoro constraints in this case and in higher genera.

we have checked that our results are indeed consistent with about 1100 virasoro constraints
containing up to 3-point genus-2 invariants. as previously mentioned, the genus-2 descendant
invariants obtained from getzlers trrs for 2-point functions (equation (7) in [17], or his
corrected version [19]) do not seem to satisfy the virasoro constraints, whereas the invariants
obtained from his 1-point trrs (equation (6) in [17]) do satisfy the virasoro constrains as
well as the required topological axioms. we do not understand the origin of our, or possibly
his, mistake.

3.4 speculations on higher-genus cases: trrs and localizations

we nd that the virasoro constraints by themselves do not provide an ecient computational
tool unless we already know many of the gw-invariants that are to be used in the constraint
equations.
in the pure gravity case, the virasoro constraints relate n+1,0 with n,0, thus
providing an eective recursions among the descendants. in the ip1 case, however, the virasoro
constraints relate n+1,0 with n,1, but there is no relation between n,1 and n1,0. this
pattern of recursion explains why the virasoro constraints generally cannot determine the
gw-invariants by themselves.

motivated by the previous computations, it is tempting to speculate that there may exist
higher-genus trrs that completely determine the gw-invariants. the only higher-genus
trrs that are known to us so far are those found by eguchi and xiong in [13]. unfortunately,
their derivation crucially depends on the assumption that the genus-g free energy fg(t) =

mm,a(cid:17)ig is a function of genus-0 correlation functions in the large phase space.

hexp(cid:16)pm,a ta

that is, their derivation assumes that

fg(t) = fg(u1 (t), u12(t), . . . , u123g1 (t))

(3.7)

where u12k := hh0,00,1    0,kii0 = k+1f0/t0
0 . at rst sight, it tells us that a
genus-g gw-invariant can be expressed in terms of genus-0 invariants; more precisely, it deter-
mines the functional dependence of the free energy on the variables t
m through the genus-zero
quantities u1(t), u12(t), . . . , u123g1 (t). in the rest of this section, we use the technique
of localization10 to comment on the validity of this assumption for complex projective spaces
ipr admitting torus actions.

0    tk

10we are grateful to prof. tian for suggesting this analysis. we are ineluctably led to make it absolutely
clear at this point that we do not have a satisfactory understanding of the ideas involving localizations and that
the ensuing statements are only speculative. as we do not feel competent enough to present a rigorous proof,
we are somewhat reluctant to present our arguments here. nevertheless, with the hope that our honesty would
engender further objectivity and caution from the readers than they would normally require, we proceed.

12

we will be very brief and use the results of [22, 28]. given a compact complex projective
variety v and a holomorphic vector bundle e  v , equipped with a torus action t  c 
    c on (v, e), the atiyah-bott xed points formula reduces the integrals of characteristic
classes of e over v to new integrals over xed loci of the torus action on v [1, 2]. recall
that the gw-invariants are dened to be integrals of certain characteristic classes over the
virtual fundamental class [mg,n(v, )]vir. the torus action on v can be naturally lifted to
mg,n(v, ) by translating the stable maps. the work of graber and pandharipande [22] states
that for non-singular projective varieties v , there exists a localization formula for the virtual
fundamental class [mg,n(v, )]vir, and thus the associated gw-invariants can be dened by
integrals over the virtual classes of the xed loci of the torus action on the moduli space. in
particular, the localization formula holds for projective spaces ipr, and the nal result which
we need is that an arbitrary gw-invariant of ipr can be expressed as a sum of hodge integrals
over products of the moduli spaces mg,n of pointed riemann surfaces; that is, roughly

hm1,1    mn,nig, d =x zm

e(n vir
 )

(3.8)

where the sum is over all the xed loci represented by certain graphs , e(n vir
 ) is the
euler class of the virtual normal bundle to m, i the pull-back of the rst chern class of
the cotangent bundle at i-th marked point on the riemann surface, and the weights are
determined by the torus action and on the cohomology classes j  h (ipr, c). furthermore,
the xed loci represented by the graph  are products of the moduli spaces of pointed stable
curves:

mg(v),val(v) ,

(3.9)

m = yvertices

with g(v)  g representing the arithematic genus of the contracted component of the domain
curve. we refer the reader to [22, 28] for the specic denitions of the notations which are
actually not so essential for our discussion.

the euler class e(n vir

 ) of the virtual normal bundle introduces the -classes, and the
resulting hodge integrals can be reduced to pure  integrals by using fabers algorithm [14].
now, we recall the fact that for the intersection theory of the tautological divisors on the
moduli space of stable pointed curves, the genus-g free energy, for g > 0, is actually a function
of the genus-0 correlators [8]:

fg(t)point = fg(u(1)(t),    , u(3g2)(t))point ,

(3.10)

where u := hh00ii0 = 2f0/t0 t0 and u(i) = iu/t0
i. combined with the localization
formula (3.8), the form of (3.10) implies that indeed each gw-invariant can be expressed in
terms of u1(0), u1 2(0), . . . , u123g1(0) and the values of their derivatives at the origin
of the phase space. this statement is however much weaker than the assumption (3.7). that
is, our analysis does not show that the functional dependence of fg(t) on t
m is only through
u1(t), u12(t), . . . , u123g1 (t). even though we cannot prove the statement at the mo-
ment, we believe that our approach deserves a further consideration.

4 recursion relations for simple hurwitz numbers

hurwitz numbers, whose study had been initiated by hurwitz more than a century ago [25],
count the number of inequivalent ramied coverings of a sphere by riemann surfaces with
specied branching conditions over one point called . the original approach of hurwitz
relates the problem to transitive factorizations of permutations into transpositions. recently,
new insights have been gained from developments in the absolute and relative gromov-witten
theory [21, 30, 37].

in this section, we take a very modest goal of obtaining new recursion relations for the genus-
0 and genus-1 simple hurwitz numbers which enumerate the coverings with no ramication over
. we take two dierent approaches which yield similar but inequivalent recursion relations.
in the notations of the previous sections, the genus-g simple hurwitz numbers are dened11
by the descendant gw-invariants of ip1 as

h g

d := h 2d+2g2

1,1

ig .

(4.1)

we rst show that the genus-0 and genus-1 trrs immediately lead to relations among the
simple hurwitz numbers in these genera. we then use the virasoro constraints to derive new
relations which could be generalized to higher genera.

4.1 from topological recursion relations

in this subsection, by using the trrs (2.8) and (2.19), we derive a new recursion relation for
simple hurwitz numbers in genus-0 and reproduce the known result of graber and pandhari-
pande in genus-1.

claim 4.1 the genus-0 simple hurwitz numbers satisfy

proof: we need the following equations which are implied by the string and the divisor
equations:

(4.3)

and similarly for h0,0 2k1

where we have used the fact that many of the correlation functions vanish for dimensional
reasons and we have relabeled indices. now, using (4.3) and relabeling the summation yields
the desired result.

together with the initial conditions h 0

2 = 1/2, these recursion relations easily
determine all the simple hurwitz numbers in genus-zero. the formulae (4.2) are qualitatively
similar to those found by graber and pandharipande [16], but they are in fact dierent recur-
sion relations.

1 = 1 and h 0

similarly, we use the genus-1 trr to derive recursion relations for genus-1 hurwitz numbers

arguments to get

taking caution that h0,1i1 = 1/24, we obtain (4.4) upon using the divisor and the string
equations.

unlike the genus-0 case, with a minor rearrangement of terms, it is easy to see that our

recursion relation (4.4) is actually equal to that of graber and pandharipande.

4.2 from virasoro constraints

it is also possible to derive new recursion relations for genus-g hurwitz numbers by combining
the virasoro constraints with some trrs. namely, the l1 virasoro constraints yield

3h g

d := 3h 2d+2g2

1,1

ig = 3(2d + 2g  3) h2,1 2d+2g4

1,1

(4.5)

for example, for genus-0, we deduce

claim 4.3 the genus-0 simple hurwitz numbers h 0
form

the l1 virasoro constraint (4.5) now implies our claim.

similarly, after some algebra, one can show

(4.9)

it can be easily checked that these relations are actually dierent from (4.2) and (4.4) and
from the ones obtained by graber and pandharipande. remark: it is important to note that
since the virasoro conjecture has been proven to hold in genera-zero and -one, the recursion
relations (4.6) and (4.9) are also true and are not mere conjectures. indeed, we have veried
numerically that they lead to the correct simple hurwitz numbers. further investigation is
needed to gain a geometric understanding of the recursion relations that we have obtained.

it is also possible to obtain similar relations for higher genus simple hurwitz numbers from
(4.5), but there are two important distinctions from the above two cases. firstly, the virasoro
constraints are still conjectural in genus-2 and higher, thus the resulting recursions are not
rigorous, even though they will provide an interesting check for the conjecture. secondly, there
are no eective trrs that can be used to express h2,1 2d+2g4
ig in terms
of hurwitz numbers. in principle, getzlers trrs (a.3) in genus-2 could be used to express
these quantities in terms of lower genus simple hurwitz numbers and h 2
k , for k < d. the trrs
however involve a large number of terms and render computations somewhat intractable. as

ig and h2,0 2d+2g3

1,1

1,1

16

there already exists a much simpler recursion relation [21], we omit the derivation here. in
higher genus, we are not aware of any eective trrs that can be applied. what seems to be
required in this study is a trr that eliminates the descendant 2, from correlators, just as
the string, divisor and dilaton equations eliminate the 0,0, 0,1 and 1,0 insertions, respectively.
it would be interesting to see if there exists a geometric reason for such an equation.

5 conclusion

in principle, one could, with much patience and stamina, extend our program to higher genera.
being novices that we are in computer science, we however stop at genus-2 and would now like
to discuss what we have learned from these exercises.

it is instructive to recall how the kdv conjecture for pure gravity, stating that the inter-
section theory of tautological classes on mg.n is governed by the kdv hierarchy and the string
equation, was proven by witten in genera-zero and -one [38]. first, recall the algebro-geometric
way of determining the descendant integrals: in genera-zero and -one, purely dimensional argu-
ments require the non-vanishing descendant integrals to include a certain number of puncture
and dilaton operators. then, the string and dilaton equations are used to reduce the integrals
to h 3
0,0i0 in genus-0 and h1,0i1 in genus-1, whose values can be determined from algebraic ge-
ometry. wittens proof is based on the fact that the string and dilaton equations and the initial
values of h 3
0,0i0 and h1,0i1, which together determine all the descendant integrals completely,
can be derived12 from his kdv conjecture. hence, the algebraic geometry and his kdv conjec-
ture yield the precisely same algorithm for computing the descendant integrals in genera-zero
and -one. in the case of point target space, there is thus no further need to invoke additional
topological recursion relations, which are nevertheless consistent with the kdv structure.

something similar but crucially dierent persists in the picture of the virasoro constraints
for ip1 in low genera. one could compute all the gw-invariants in genera-zero, -one and -two
by using only the string, divisor and dilaton equations together with the aforementioned topo-
logical recursion relations. on the other hand, the virasoro constraints are not strong enough
to determine the gw-invariants by themselves. it thus seems that the virasoro constraints
are weaker than the topological recursion relations. as we have checked numerically, the gw-
invariants obtained from the trrs satisfy the virasoro constraints in genus-zero and -one, as
they should according to the rigorous proofs of mathematicians, and even in genus-two, which
has yet no direct proof. thus, as in the pure gravity case, the trrs are consistent with the
conjectured integrable hierarchy manifested by the virasoro constraints which however, unlike
the pure gravity case, do not determine the generating functions completely.

the relations between the trrs and the virasoro constraints appear to be quite mysterious.
even in the case of pure gravity, although the trrs seem redundant, it is not known how
to derive them directly from the kdv hierarchy or whether it is possible to do so at all. an
analogous question in the case of ip1, in which the trrs and the virasoro constraints reverse

12more precisely, the dilaton equation can be derived from the string and the kdv equations.

17

their roles in some sense, would be: do trrs imply virasoro constraints in genera-zero, -one,
and -two? since l1 and l2 generate the (half branch of) virasoro algebra and since l1 is
just the string equation, which is true for general topological string theories, in order to answer
the question, one only needs to prove that the trrs imply the l2 condition. we have tried an
inductive approach to show that all derivatives of the l2z vanish by the trrs and the l1
constraint, but it does not seem possible to prove the statement.

the study of virasoro constraints is presently only at its rudimentary stage, and any
subsequent eort to understand their hidden structure would require unraveling their relation
with various topological recursion relations and also with the constraints arising from the
study of hodge integrals.
in this paper, we have used the l1, l0 conditions and trrs
to compute the descendant gw-invariants of ip1 in low genera. the ineectiveness of the
virasoro constraints suggests that there may exist an enlarged algebra including the virasoro
algebra and giving us a master hierarchy encoding the trr relations in all genera. since
the virtual localization technique expresses all gw-invariants in terms of hodge integrals over
products of the moduli space of stable pointed curves [22], it is also tempting to speculate that
the virasoro conjecture and the trrs can be translated into a statement of some kind of an
integrable hierarchy involving the very large phase space of manin and zograf [34].

c partial lists of the gw-invariants

for those who are interested in the numerical values of the gw-invariants and for the sake of
completeness, we here present, in ne prints, a few examples of the non-vanishing invariants.
in most cases, we omit the ones that can be reduced by using the string, dilaton, or divisor
equations.
