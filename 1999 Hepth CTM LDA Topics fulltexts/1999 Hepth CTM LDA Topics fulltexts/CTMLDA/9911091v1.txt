abstract

we show that a realization of the correspondence ads2/cft1 for near extre-
mal reissner-nordstrom black holes in arbitrary dimensional einstein-maxwell
gravity exactly reproduces, via cardys formula, the deviation of the bekenstein-
hawking entropy from extremality. we also show that this mechanism is valid
for schwarzschild-de sitter black holes around the degenerate solution ds2sn.
these results reinforce the idea that the bekenstein-hawking entropy can be de-
rived from symmetry principles.

1 introduction

for a long time it has been a remarkable puzzle to unravel the origin of the bekenstein-
hawking entropy of a black hole. one would expect that string theory, as a theory of
quantum gravity, could offer a microscopic explanation of black hole entropy. how-
ever, only recently it has been possible, by applying d-brane techniques, to perform
precise calculations which succeed in reproducing the bekenstein-hawking entropy
for extremal [1, 2] and near-extremal black hole solutions [3] (see also [4, 5]). on the
other hand three-dimensional gravity can also be quantized in a consistent way [6, 7]
and therefore one can expect to nd a statistical interpretation for the btz black hole
entropy [8]. carlip showed [9] that, by counting microscopic degrees of freedom of a
conformal eld theory living in an appropriate boundary, one can exactly reproduce the
bekenstein-hawking formula for the btz black holes. furthermore, strominger [10]
has also been able to obtain the entropy formula by exploiting the two-dimensional
conformal algebra arising as an appropriate symmetry of three-dimensional gravity
with a negative cosmological constant [11]. these results suggest that the statistical
explanation of the entropy is not too much tied to the details of the quantum theory,
but rather to general symmetry properties of the quantum gravity theory. this point of
view has been put forward in [12, 13, 14].

the holographic correspondence between gravity on ads3 and a two-dimensional
conformal eld theory, discovered by brown and henneaux, was realized in terms of
asymptotic symmetries at spatial innity. this type of realization of the ads/cft cor-
respondence [15, 16] was analyzed for the jackiw-teitelboim mode of 2d gravity in
[17, 18] and further studied in [19] in connection with gravity theories around extremal
black hole solutions. the extremal btz and four-dimensional reissner-nordstrom
black holes possess geometries of the form ads2s1 and ads2s2 respectively. it
was shown in [19] that the ads2/cft1 correspondence, implemented via asymptotic
symmetries, can be used to exactly reproduce the deviation of the bekenstein-hawking
entropy from extremality. as it was argued in [20], the symmetry algebra of a one-
dimensional conformal eld theory is just a copy of the virasoro algebra. the nite-
dimensional conformal part of this virasoro algebra, the sl(2,r) symmetry, is the
isometry group of anti-de sitter space in two dimensions. however, we can alterna-
tively regard the sl(2,r) symmetry as the isometry group of de sitter space in two
space-time dimensions and consider the virasoro algebra as its natural enlargement to
the conformal group in one dimension. one of the aims of this paper is to point out that
the realization of the ads2/cft1 correspondence in terms of asymptotic symmetries
can also be reformulated as a ds2/cft1 correspondence, providing, in turn, a statistical
description of the entropy of schwarzschild-de sitter black holes [21] near the degen-
erate solution (i.e. the nariai solution [22]), which has the geometry ds2s2. this
way, the explanation of the entropy for two physically different situations, near ex-
tremal reissner-nordstrom and near degenerate schwarzschild-de sitter black holes,
is similar and seems to indicate the universality of the mechanism. the second goal

1

of this paper is to show that this result is valid in any dimension, thus reinforcing the
idea that the bekenstein-hawking entropy can be just derived from symmetry consid-
erations.

the paper is structured as follows.

in sect.2 we review, in a parallel way, the
reissner-nordstrom and schwarzschild-de sitter black hole solutions and the corre-
sponding degenerate limits:
the robinson-bertotti (ads2s2) [23, 24] and nariai
(ds2s2) solutions, respectively. these degenerate solutions represent either black
holes of minimum size (for a given electrical charge) or black holes of maximum size
(for a given cosmological constant  > 0).
in both cases these solutions are sta-
ble. the degenerate reissner-nordstrom solution is extremal and the schwarzschild-
de sitter solution possesses two horizons (the schwarzschild black hole horizon and
the cosmological one) with the same size and the same temperature, thus being in ther-
mal equilibrium. in sect.3 we shall show, also in a parallel way, that the deviation of
the bekenstein-hawking entropy of nearly degenerate black holes from the entropy of
the degenerate solution can be derived, via cardys formula [25], from the virasoro
algebra of asymptotic symmetries. we shall emphasize the fact that this mechanism,
already introduced in [19], works for both situations: for asymptotic geometries of
the form ads2s2 and also ds2s2. in sect.4 we shall generalize the above results
for reissner-nordstrom and schwarzschild-de sitter black holes in any dimension.
finally, in sect.5, we state our conclusions.

2 degenerate horizons and (a)ds2s2 geometries
first of all we shall briey review the basic facts concerning the emergence of ads2s2
and ds2s2 geometries in the near-horizon limit of reissner-nordstrom and schwarz-
schild-de sitter black holes. the reissner-nordstrom (rn) black hole can be described
by the metric

where

ds2 = v (r)dt2 + v (r)1dr2 + r2d2 ,

v (r) = 1 

2ml2

r

+

q2l4
r2 ,

(2.1)

(2.2)

q is the electrical charge and l2 = g(4) is four-dimensional newtons constant. for
m2 > q2, v (r) has two positive roots corresponding to the inner and external black
hole horizons. but in the limit m2  q2 the two roots coincide and the horizons appar-
ently merge. however, this is nothing but an artifact of a poor coordinate choice. in this
degenerate case the schwarzschild coordinates become inappropriate since v (r)  0
between the two horizons. to see what really happens, let us try

m2
q2 = 1 + 2 ,

2

(2.3)

so that the degenerate case is recovered in the limit   0. we can now dene new
coordinates  and  by

t = |q|


 ,

r = |q|(1 +  sin ) .

(2.4)

the resultant metric, a rst order in , is

ds2 = q2(cid:20)(cos2    sin  cos 2)d2  (1 + 

sin   sin 3

2 cos2 

)d2 + d2(cid:21) , (2.5)

and when  = 0 there is a non-trivial geometry between the horizons

ds2 = q2( cos2 d2 + d2) + q2d2 .

(2.6)

this is the ads2s2 robinson-bertotti geometry describing the gravitational eld of
a covariantly constant electrical eld [23, 24]. the transformation (2.4) possesses a
remarkable similarity to the ginsparg-perry one [26] for the degenerate horizon case
in the schwarzschild-de sitter (sds) black hole, where the near-horizon geometry is
the ds2s2 nariai geometry [22]

ds2 = 1( sin2 d2 + d2) + 1d2 ,

(2.7)

and  > 0 is the cosmological constant. in both (2.6) and (2.7) cases, the geometry is
given by the product of two constant-curvature spaces.

we shall now rederive the above results in a more general setting. we start consid-

ering the most general spherically symmetrical metric

ds2 = a2(r, t)dt2 + b2(r, t)dr2 + d2(r, t)d2 .

(2.8)

if d(r, t) 6= const. in the above metric, we can perform a coordinate transformation
r  r = d(r, t) and, after further coordinate redenitions, we can write the above
metric in the well known form

ds2 = e(r,t)dt2 + e(r,t)dr2 + r2d2 .

the only thing that remains to be done is to impose einsteins equations

g + g = 8l2t ,

(2.9)

(2.10)

where  is the cosmological constant. for a cosmological charged body (a =
( q
r , 0, 0, 0)) the solution (generalized birkhoffs theorem) reads as

ds2 = u(r; , q, m)dt2 +

dr2

u(r; , q, m)

+ r2d2 ,

(2.11)

3

where

u(r; , q, m) = 1 

2ml2
r 


3

r2 +

q2l4
r2 ,

(2.12)

and m is the mass of the black hole. for  = q = 0 we recover the schwarzschild
black hole, for  = 0 the rn black hole and for q = 0 the sds black hole.

it is interesting to comment that, in a different way from the schwarzschild black
hole, the , q 6= 0 cases possess a richer physics. whereas for the rst case the function
u(r; m) only has one zero (the black hole horizon), the presence of new parameters
provides more complexity so that the function u(r; , q, m) can have different roots,
simple or multiple roots, depending in which way we adjust the different parameters.
one can nd some degenerate cases in which two different horizons become coincident
for certain relations between the parameters m, q and . two simple examples of this
feature are the rn and sds black holes. in the second example there are also two roots
3l2  1
(corresponding to the black hole and the cosmological horizon) for 0 < m < 1
( > 0) that become coincident (r =  1

2

2 ) in the limit m  1

3l2  1
2 .

now we consider the case1 d2(r, t) = r2

0 = const. in this case the spacetime
decomposes into the product of a two-dimensional manifold and the two-dimensional
spherical surface (m4 =m2s2); m2 with coordinates t, r, and s2 with coordinates ,
. we can now proceed in a similar way as the d(r, t) 6= const. case. by means of
some coordinate redenitions we get the following metric
ds2 = e(r,t)dt2 + e(r,t)dr2 + r2

(2.13)
note that both d(r, t) 6= const. and d(r, t) = const. are different solutions not being
diffeomorphism connected. thus, the crucial point is to check the einstein equations in
order to look for possible solutions to the (r, t), (r, t) functions. as in the d(r, t) 6=
const. case we immediately obtain that the above metric should be static. further-
more it is worthwhile to remark that these kinds of solutions do not always exist. the
simplest example emerges in the vacuum t = 0 and with a vanishing cosmological
constant  = 0. the non-vanishing components of the einstein tensor are

0d2 .

(2.14)

and it is immediately noticeable that g 0
1 do not satisfy the vacuum einstein
equations (2.10). instead, if we consider a non-vanishing stress tensor or a cosmolog-
ical constant, the situation changes and new solutions for the functions (r) and (r)
appear. we can get more global information about these solutions by taking the trace
of (2.10), being the curvature r = r + r, where

are respectively the curvatures of m2 and s2. it follows immediately that r = 4 and
then m2 is also a constant curvature space. let us analyze two simple and well-known
examples.

 = 0

# 1. t 
in this case the components g 0
1 satisfy the equations (2.10) for  > 0 being the
constant r2
0 = 1. thus m2 is a positive constant-curvature space and the remaining
equations solve for the de sitter space. the global topology is then ds2s2 and the
metric is nothing but the nariai metric (2.7).

0 = g 1

# 2.  = 0
now r = 0, r2
consider the tensor of a constant electrical eld

0 = q2 and equations (2.10) solve for a constant stress tensor. let us

t 0
0 = t 1

1 = t 2

2 = t 3

3 = 

1
8q2 .

(2.16)

thus m2 becomes the anti-de sitter space being the global topology ads2s2 and the
metric given by (2.6).

in the two above examples the d(t, r) = const. solutions are just the geome-
tries that we found previously around the degenerate horizon congurations in the
d(t, r) 6= const. solutions. we shall show this in a more general context in the re-
maining part of this section. let us consider again the general static solution (2.9) with
(r) = (r) = ln u(r; m, ), where m is the mass and s are parameters such as
the cosmological constant, electrical charge, etc. the horizons are the roots of u(r).
solutions with horizon degeneracy will be given by u(r) with two or more roots when
two neighbouring roots become coincident, in say, r0, for some determined relations
between the parameters m0 = m() as it is shown in fig. 1.

since r0 is a double root of u(r; m, ) for m = m0, it follows

u(r0; m0, ) = u (r0; m0, ) = 0 ,

u (r0; m0, ) =  r0 ,

(2.17)

where primes denote derivatives with respect to the radial coordinate r, and r0 is a
constant. now we perform a perturbative transformation around the degenerate radius
r0 by introducing a new pair of coordinates t, r

t =

t


,

r = r0 + r ,

(2.18)

where 0 <   1. we also write m = m0(1 + k2) where k is an arbitrary dimen-
sionless constant being positive for r0 < 0 and negative for r0 > 0. the degenerate
case is recovered when  = 0. expanding in powers of r  r0 in a similar way to what

(2.19)
where a2 = km0mu(r0, m, ), and still remains a non-trivial geometry in the near-
horizon limit   0 with constant curvature r = r0 + 2
. note that r0 is positive
(negative) depending on the timelike (spacelike) character of the region between the
horizons (see fig. 1) and, in fact, it can be written as r0 =  2
. concerning the
two examples considered earlier, we have r0 =  1

the existence of a connection between the presence of black hole solutions with
horizon degeneracy and (a)ds2s2 decomposed solutions is now clear. the con-
struction of these kinds of solutions from birkhoffs theorem is associated with the
existence of multi-horizon black hole solutions, and they also arise as the near-horizon
geometries around degenerate horizons.

3 holography and entropy of nearly degenerate rn and

sds black holes

in this section we shall explain how the deviation of the bekenstein-hawking entropy
from extremality for four-dimensional reissner-nordstrom black holes can be derived
in terms of the asymptotic symmetries of the corresponding near-horizon geometry.
moreover, we shall also show, in a parallel way, that this mechanism can be used to
obtain the deviation of the entropy of sds black holes from the entropy of the degen-
erate solution. in both cases the near-horizon geometry, i.e. the leading order metric

6

in power expansion with respect to the parameter , can be written as

ds2 = (a2 

r0

x2)dt2 + (a2

0d2 .

(3.1)

dimensional metric

it is not difcult to see that the innitesimal diffeomorphisms  a(x, t) preserving the
above boundary conditions are

 t = (t)

(3.5)

(3.6)

where the prime means derivative with respect to the t coordinate, which is a time-

like coordinate for ads2 ( r0 < 0) and space-like for ds2 ( r0 > 0). the o(cid:0) 1
x4(cid:1)

terms in the t component are arbitrary and represent the pure gauge transformations.
choosing for instance

 t =

one can show that tt, xx and tx transform as follows

tt =  r0x ,

and this implies that one can make the gauge choice

moreover it is just

tx = 0 .

according to the rule

tt = (t)

(t) .

(3.14)

therefore tt behaves as the stress-tensor of a (one-dimensional) conformal eld the-
ory living on the boundary of (a)ds2.

we must note that the boundary of ads2 is a timelike surface while for ds2 is
spacelike so that the holographic description of the gravitational degrees of freedom of
near-extremal reissner-nordstrom and near-degenerate schwarzschild-de sitter black
holes are physically different. however, mathematically we can treat both situations in
a similar way. the fourier components of the vector elds  aa, when t is considered
a compact parameter, close down a virasoro algebra with a vanishing central charge.
note that for ads2 it is natural to consider periodicity in the time coordinate t while
for ds2 the natural periodicity is in the space-like t coordinate. however it is well
known that a canonical realization of these types of asymptotic symmetries is allowed
to have a non-zero central charge. in fact the expression (3.14)) implies that the fourier
components lr

(3.17)

where the positive constant  is a coefcient which should be determined by the ef-
fective lagrangian governing the physics near extremality or degeneracy. at this
point it is interesting to remark that the integration with respect to the t variable
in (3.15), necessary to perform a mode decomposition to get a virasoro algebra, may
seems strange for ads2 since then t is a time-like coordinate. however for ds2, t is
a space-like coordinate and the expression (3.15) ts into the standard procedure of
the canonical formalism. this is reminiscent to the fact that, for a two-dimensional
conformal eld theory, the chirality condition of the stress-tensor components implies
that one can transform an integral over a spatial coordinate by an integral over the time
variable. our situation is physically different but it could be an inherent feature of
one-dimensional conformal eld theory. in fact the degenerate solution of the corre-
sponding euclidean black holes is, in both cases, of the form s2s2, unravelling up

8

to a sign a common origin in the euclidean sector. certainly this point merits further
analysis2.

we shall now evaluate the corresponding central charges for both classes of black
holes. to this end, and due that the variables (t, x) are the relevant ones, it is quite
useful to construct the effective theory describing the effective two-dimensional dy-
namics. let us consider the einstein-maxwell action with a cosmological constant

i (4) =

1

16g(4) z d4xpg(4)(r(4)  2 + (f (4))2) .

imposing spherical symmetry on the metric

ds2

(3.18)

(3.19)

where l2 = g(4), x are the 2d coordinates (t, x) and d2 is the metric on the two-
sphere, and assuming a radial electric eld

l2a = (

we must stress now that the asymptotic symmetries of the effective metric (3.33) are
the same as those of the four-dimensional one since the r  t part of both metrics
only differs by a constant factor 0 = 0

lagrangian the above expansion reads

i (4) = z d2xg(r  + l2v (0) ) + o(2) .

(3.35)

so the leading order is governed by the jackiw-teitelboim model [29] (see also [30]).
the central charge can be worked out using canonical methods. the full hamiltonian
h of the theory, to leading order in , is given by
h = h0 + k ,

(3.36)

where h0 is the bulk hamiltonian of the jackiw-teitelboim theory and k is the bound-
ary term necessary to have well-dened variational derivatives. remarkably, the bound-
ary term, after some algebra, turns out to be proportional to the stress-tensor tt

5 conclusions and nal remarks

the goal of this paper is to point out that the deviation of the bekenstein-hawking
entropy of nearly degenerate black holes from the degenerate solution can be com-
puted, via cardys formula, from the conformal asymptotic symmetry of the geome-
tries (a)ds2sn associated with the degenerate reissner-nordstrom and schwarz-
schild-de sitter black holes. partial results has been obtained in a previous paper [19]
and here we have generalized them to arbitrary dimensions and also for geometries
with a ds2 factor. we can wonder whether these results can also be further extended to
other types of black holes. according to the analysis of [19], this mechanism to derive
the entropy for nearly degenerate black holes works for a generic two-dimensional
dilaton gravity theory. therefore we can conclude that our approach can be applied

17

to any higher-dimensional black hole whose thermodynamics can be effectively de-
scribed by the thermodynamics of a two-dimensional dilaton theory. so, for instance,
the string black holes considered in [35] are natural candidates to further extend our
results.

appendix a conformal redenitions and dimensional

reduction

in section 4, a conformal reparametrization (4.9), (4.10) was used in order to get the
effective two-dimensional theory that describes the geometry close to the degenerate
horizon. we shall now state precisely some technical aspects of it. let us rewrite the
effective action (4.8) in the form

i =

2gz d2xpg(cid:16)d() r + h()||2 + l2 v ()(cid:17) ,

where d() is given by (4.9) and

in order to get (4.12) we perform the conformal redenition (4.10) where  = d()
and

v () =

finally 2() can be obtained by means of the the following differential equation [34]

in order to determine the constant c, recall that in (4.10) ds2

we get
