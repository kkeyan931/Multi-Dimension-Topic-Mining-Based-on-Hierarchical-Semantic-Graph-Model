abstract

we discuss a (10+2)d n = (1, 1) superalgebra and its projections to m-theory, type iia
and iib algebras. from the complete classication of a second-rank central term valued
in the so(10, 2) algebra, we nd all possible bps states coming from this term. we show
that, among them, there are two types of 1/2-susy bps congurations; one corresponds
to a super (2+2)-brane while another one arises from a nilpotent element in so(10, 2).

1 introduction

it is intriguing to consider the possibility that a theory of everything predicts not only
the dimensionality of spacetime but also its signature. in a paper [1], with this spirit in
mind, blencowe and du investigated possible supersymmetric branes moving in space-
time without a priori assuming denite signatures of both the brane worldvolume and the
spacetime. requiring local -symmetry on the worldvolume and spacetime supersym-
metry, they found, adding to well known string and membrane congurations, two extra
octonionic type branes; a (1+2)-brane in (9+2)d and a (2+2)-brane in (10+2)d. the
latter (2+2)-brane can possibly exist only when we consider an n = (1, 0) non-poincare
spacetime supersymmetry, which is the maximal symmetry to have 32 real supercharges.
in recent development of string unication, the connection of various supersymmetric
theories in higher dimensions has been discussed. it is well known that the conjectured
m-theory, when compactied on s1 and s1/z2, gives type iia and e8  e8 heterotic
string theories, respectively [2]. m-theory also leads to type iib, so(32) heterotic and
type i strings less directly upon compactication to nine dimensions. other higher di-
mensional structures also have been explored to obtain a unied picture of those strings
and to explain various duality relations among them, in which the notion of extra time
dimensions has emerged as hidden dimensions of the higher dimensional unication theo-
ries. a notable example is f-theory [3] which has been proposed as a (10+2)d structure
to give a geometrical explanation of the self s-duality of the type iib string.
in [4],
superalgebras in dimensions beyond eleven have been studied in the context of the uni-
cation of m-theory, type iia and iib algebras. with the restriction of the number of real
supercharges to be 64 or less, they found two possible distinct superalgebras; n = (2, 0)
algebra in (10+2)d and n = (1, 0) algebra in (11+3)d, where the latter is reduced to
various algebras in lower dimensions; n = 1 algebras in (11+2)d, (10+3)d and (11+1)d,
n = 2 algebra in (10+1)d and n = (1, 1) algebra in (10+2)d.

a fundamental question about physics with two or more time dimensions is what
kind of local theory can exist in such a spacetime. although there are many suggestions
concerning it, very little is known about the structure of the local theory. in particular,
we should be careful to discuss the dynamical aspect of such a theory, since the concept
of dynamics and energy used in ordinary theories with one time should be modied in the
present case. alternatively it would be a promising way to start with the analysis of the
symmetrical aspect of the theory. indeed, the structure of superalgebra is sensitive to the
dimensionality and the signature of spacetime and would teach us about the possibility

2

of extra time directions. it also seems possible to see what types of fundamental objects
exist in the superalgebra through the investigation of central terms appearing in anti-
commutators among supercharges.

in this paper, we discuss n = (1, 1) and (1, 0) superalgebras in (10+2)d, assuming
that the algebras are relevant to some local theory in (10+2)d. as described in section 2,
the n = (1, 1) algebra is composed of the so(10, 2) generators mab, (pseudo)-majorana
spinor supercharges q and tensorial central terms z (k)
a1ak (k = 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11) [5],[6].
since the algebra does not contain any vector generator, it is not the poincare type
superalgebra, so is rather unfamiliar to us. however, we see that its weyl projected n =
(1, 0) algebra is related to the (10+1)d m-theory algebra (m-algebra) and the (9+1)d
type iia algebra by dimensional reduction. it is also shown that another projection of
the (10+2)d n = (1, 1) algebra, together with dimensional reduction to (9+1)d, leads
to the type iib algebra.

a primary interest on the (10+2)d algebras is how many and what types of bps
congurations possibly exist in them. the above mentioned connection of the (10+2)d
n = (1, 1) algebra to m-, type iia and iib algebras may suggest a (10+2)d origin
of various bps states in m-theory and all known superstring theories.
in this paper,
we concentrate on the second-rank tensorial central term z (2)
ab and investigate possible
bps states arising from this term. as a rst step, we need to simplify the form of the
central term. z (2) belongs to the so(10, 2) algebra and hence transforms under the adjoint
action of the so(10, 2) group. unlike the cases of complex or real compact lie algebras,
so(10, 2) elements are not reduced to a unique form under the so(10, 2) action and hence
the classication of so(10, 2) becomes complicated. with the use of results in [7],[8],[9],
we classify conjugacy classes of so(10, 2) completely and construct representatives for the
classes, which contain at most 6 parameters. the classication enables us to pick up
all possible bps states characterized by some fraction of surviving supersymmetry, as
shown in section 3. it is also demonstrated how the (10+2)d bps states reduce to those
in m-theory and type iia and iib theories. finally several concluding remarks are given
in section 4.

the (10+2)d at metric is ab = (,, +,   , +). a, b,   = 0, 0, 1,   , 10 denotes
the (10+2)d indices, while a, b,   = 0, 1,   , 10 and , ,   = 0, 1,   , 9 are (10+1)d
and (9+1)d indices, respectively.

2 n = (1, 1) superalgebra in (10+2)d

we consider a graded generalization of the so(10, 2) lorentz algebra with generators
mab in terms of spinor supersymmetry generators q,

[mab, mcd] = macbd + mbdac  madbc  mbcad ,
[mab, q] =

 q .

(1)

(2)

with these commutation relations, we have to dene anti-commutators among the qs,
which depends on the dimensionality and the signature of spacetime.

2.1 spinors in d = (s, t )

in a general d = (s, t ) spacetime, with gamma matrices a,

{a, b} = 2 abid ,
it can be shown that there exists a matrix b satisfying

a = b1ab ,

bb = id ,

(3)

(4)

where parameters  and  are specied by the value of s  t as follows [10].

with the product of all time component gamma matrices a = 01    0t , the conjugation
matrix is dened as c = bt a, which satises

(5)

in the  = +1 case, we can impose the majorana ( = 1) or the pseudo-majorana
( = +1) condition as

q = bq  q  qa = qt c .

(6)

in the even dimension d, we can dene a denite chirality for spinors by the chirality
matrix

  (1)(st )/401    0t 1    s , 2 = id ,

(7)
from (5) and (7) , we obtain the condition  = b1b, if s  t = 0 mod 4, showing
that it is possible to impose the (pseudo)-majorana-weyl condition for spinors in 10+2
dimensions.

{, a} = 0 .

2.2 anti-commutators

the general form of anti-commutation relations among the (pseudo-)majorana spinors
q becomes

{q, q} = xk

1
k!

(a1akc1)z (k)

a1ak .

(8)

since the left-hand-side (lhs) of (8) is a real symmetric matrix, we have to choose z (k)
which make the right-hand-side (rhs) of (8) symmetric. in 10+2 dimensions, using (5),
we can show that

a1akc1 is symmetric for k = 1, 2 mod 4 for the c case,
for k = 2, 3 mod 4 for the c+ case.

for the c case, the algebra consists of the set of generators {mab, q, z (k)}, (k =
1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10), which becomes a supersymmetric extension of the poincare algebra if the
vector z (1)
a is identied with the translation generator pa. this, however, causes a prob-
lem in the construction of the worldvolume theory [6]. since the matrix (abcc1
)

is anti-symmetric with respect to (, ), the wess-zumino term on the (2+2)d world-
volume is identically zero, which means that the -symmetry can not be dened in this
case. thus the degrees of freedom of bosons and fermions on the worldvolume do not
match up.

in the following, we consider the c+ case which leads to a non-poincar e superalgebra

dened with (1), (2) and

{q, q} =

where spinor indices ,  run from 1 to 2[12/2] = 64. the two-rank tensorial central term
z (2)
ab is supposed to be independent from the lorentz generators mab. we note that z (2)
ab
has a constraint arising from the positivity condition that all eigenvalues i of the matrix
{q, q} of (9) are non-negative. henthforth, for simplicity, we take c+ = 00 (b+ = i)
and the spinor q to be real. then it can be easily shown that the trace of all terms in
the rhs of (9) vanishes except for the term (00c1

in the following, we demonstrate two projections of the (10+2)d spin space using the

explicit representation of gamma matrices,

0 = i2  i32 ,

a = 1  a ,

(11)

where a are (10+1)d gamma matrices, in which  equal to (9+1)d gamma matrices

we impose the weyl condition to q by the projection operator p  1

 = 00    10 in (7). in this projection, z (k) with k = 3, 7, 11 drop out from (9) and

[11].

we further take the s1 compactication of the spatial 10-direction of the (10+1)d
a of opposite

spacetime. we decompose q  into two majorana-weyl supercharges q

note that the positivity condition z (2)

the above two projections. having claried the above relation of the (10+2)d n = (1, 1)
algebra to m-, type iia and iib algebras, in the next section we investigate the connection
of bps states inherent in the (10+2)d algebra with those in m-theory and the string
theories, starting from the classication of the (10+2)d bps states.

3 (10+2)d bps states

3.1 bps states in (10+1)d m-algebra

before classifying bps states in (10+2)d, it is better to recall how to nd bps states
in an ordinary poincar e superalgebra. as an example, let us take the m-algebra in
(10+1)d, with only the rst term in the rhs of (14),

{q , q } = (a c1)  pa .

7

(19)

a bps state is annihilated by some combination of supercharges and hence has a con-
guration with det{q, q} = 0, which is equivalent to the null condition p 2 = 0. if
pa is null, by the action of the so(10, 1) rotation, we can choose a frame in which
pa = (,, 0,   , 0), with a positive parameter . then (19) becomes

{q , q } = (i  10)   .

(20)

since the matrix 10 squares to the identity and is also traceless, the half of eigenvalues
of 10 are +1 and half 1. thus we see that there exists a unique bps state in
(19) breaking half of the supersymmetries, which corresponds to a massless particle in
(10+1)d [11]. we need the second and third central terms in the rhs of (14) to obtain
other bps states, e.g., m2 and m5 branes.

3.2 bps states in (10+2)d superalgebra

3.2.1 second-rank central term zab

we now consider what types of bps states exist in the (10+2)d n = (1, 1) superalgebra.
in this paper, we concentrate on the anti-symmetric central term z (2)
ab in the rhs of (9)
and make other z (k) zero;

{q, q} =

1
2

(abc1)z (2)

ab .

(21)

in order to nd possible bps congurations inherent in (21), we intend to simplify the
form of z (2)
ab by the action of the so(10, 2) group, just as the case of the translation
generator pa in the above m-algebra. the matrix z = (z (2)a
b) may be regarded as a map
of the 12d vector space v(12) onto v(12); for v = (va)  v(12), zv = (z (2)a
bvb)  v(12).
we see that z belongs to the so(10, 2) algebra represented onv(12),

so(10, 2) = {z  gl(12, r); (zu, v) + (u, zv) = 0 , for all u, v  v(12)} ,

(22)

where  is the (10+2)d metric (u, v) = abuavb. an arbitrary element z  so(10, 2)
is transformed under the adjoint action of so(10, 2); z  1z,   so(10, 2). the
problem to nd bps states then reduces, as a rst step, to that of classifying all conjugacy
classes in the so(10, 2) algebra under the adjoint action. in 12d euclidean space-time,
under the so(12) rotation, any z in the so(10, 2) algebra is reduced to canonical form
which has six 22 anti-symmetric blocks ak = ihk2 (k = 1,   , 6) on the diagonal part.
however, in pseudo-euclidean space-time, some congurations of z can not be brought
to canonical form and we have to be careful for the classication.

8

it is known that an arbitrary element z in a semisimple lie algebra g has a unique

decomposition,

z = s + n ,

[s, n] = 0 .

(23)

where s and n are semisimple and nilpotent elements in g, respectively.

an element s  g is called semisimple if its adjoint representation ad(s) is a diag-
onalizable matrix. in complex or real compact lie algebras, any semisimple element is
reduced to a unique form like the above so(12) case, since there exists a unique cartan
subalgebra in g. in the real non-compact case, however, there are several non-equivalent
cartan subalgebras under the adjoint group g. an example is the sl(2, r) algebra, which
has two cartan algebras, {3} and {i2} (,   r). these are obviously inequivalent,
since the former generates a non-compact group, while the latter yields the 2d rotation.
the classication of all cartan subalgebras in real semisimple lie algebras is given in a
paper of sugiura [7]. in the real non-compact case, there also appears a nilpotent element
n  g such that n m 6= 0 and n m+1 = 0 for some non-negative integer m. thus, in our
superalgebra dened on the pseudo-euclidean spacetime with two time directions, we
expect to obtain several conjugacy classes in so(10, 2) containing nilpotent elements.

the complete classication of real semisimple lie algebras under the action of its
adjoint group is given in a paper of burgoyne and cushman [9]. in the following, we
classify the so(10, 2) algebra according to the method in [9] and construct a representative
for each conjugacy class in so(10, 2).

3.2.2 types 

we give a brief review on results in [9] which are needed in the rest of this paper. we start
with the general linear group gl(12, c) = gl(v(12)) represented on the 12d complex
vector space v(12). the orthogonal group o(10, 2) is dened as a real form of gl(12, c)
specied by an automorphism  of gl(12, c) with 2 = +1,

o(10, 2) = {g  gl(12, c)| (gu, gv) = (u, v) for all u, v  v(12) , 1g = g} .
note that  acts on v(12) as an anti-linear map onto v(12) with (u, v) = (u, v).
the corresponding lie algebra of o(10, 2) is o(10, 2) = o(v(12), , )  so(10, 2), which is
given in (22).

(24)

we introduce an equivalence relation among pairs of (z, v(n))  o(v, (p), ), which is
associated with the group o(n  p, p) and represented on v(n) with the metric (p). let
z  o(v (n), (p), ) then we write (z, v(n))  (z, v (n)) if there exists an isomorphism 

9

of v onto v  such that z = z,  =  and (p)(u, v) = (p)(u, v) for u, v  v(n).
in [9], an equivalence class for  is called a type  and its dimension is given by dim. =
dim.v(n) = n if (z, v(n))  . the index of  denoted as ind. is the number of time
(negative sign) components in the metric (p)  o(v(n), (p), ), i.e. ind. = p. the type
 is nothing but a conjugacy class of the o(n  p, p) algebra under the adjoint action of
o(n  p, p),
proposition 1. ([9], sec. 2.1)
let z, x  o(v(n), (p), ). there exists a g  o(v(n), (p), ) such that g1zg = x
if and only if (z, v(n)) and (x, v(n)) belong to the same type.

next, we introduce the notion of indecomposable type. let z  o(v(n), (p), ) and
let  denote the type containing (z, v(n)). we suppose that v(n) = w1 + w2 is a sum of
proper, disjoint, z-invariant, -invariant, and orthogonal subspaces. let  i
(p) (i = 1, 2) be
the restriction of the metric (p) to each wi, then the restriction of z to each wi denoted
as zi belongs to o(wi,  i
(p), ). let i denote the type containing (zi, wi). then we write
 = 1 + 2. a type  is called indecomposable if it can not be written as the sum of
two or more types. for any type , we have

theorem. ([9], sec. 2.2)
the decomposition  = 1 + 2 +    + s into indecomposable types is unique.
in the decomposition, a representative z in  can be given as a matrix to have repre-
sentatives zk  k (k = 1,   , s) on its diagonal part, with respect to the metric (p)
which has metrices  k
(p)  k on its diagonal. if a type  is decomposed as above, for
the dimension and the index of , we have

dim. = dim.1 + dim.2 +    + dim.s ,
ind. = ind.1 + ind.2 +    + ind.s .

(25)

in table 2 below, we write down all indecomposable types and their dimension and index
for the o(q, p) algebra. in our o(10, 2) case, all types , i.e., all conjugacy classes in the
o(10, 2) algebra can be obtained by taking all possible combinations of the indecompos-
able types with the conditions dim. = 12 and ind. = 2, which will be done in the
following sections.

we briey explain the notation of indecomposable types in table 2 and how to con-
struct a representative for each type. let (z, v )  m(1,   , t), then the subscript
m = 0, 1,   means that, in the decomposition z = s + n in sec. 3.2.1, the nilpotent n
satises n m 6= 0 and n m+1 = 0, while parameters 1,   , t  c are eigenvalues of the
semisimple element s. let f be a subspace of the vector space v spanned by eigenvec-
tors {e1,   , et} of s. we can show that v is decomposed as v = f + nf +   + n mf .
now the semisimple s can be supposed to belong to the algebra o(f, m, ) represented
on f with the metric m(u, v)   (u, n mv) for u, v  f . note that, from the nilpotency
of n, the metric m(u, v) = 0 for u, v  nv . non-zero values of m are given for each
indecomposable type in the appendix 2 of [9]. the description of the indecomposable
types enables us to construct an explicit matrix realization of z = s + n  o(v, , ) and
the metric  on v . in particular, descriptions of z and  as real matrices on v can be
given easily by taking -invariant combinations of elements in v . in the appendix in this
paper, we give explicit forms of representatives for all indecomposable types relevant to
our o(10, 2) case. having the representatives and arranging them on the diagonal part of
12 12 matrix, we obtain a realization of a representative for each case in o(10, 2), which
is with respect to a (10+2)d metric with metrices of indecomposable types arranged on
its diagonal part. finally, by an isomorphism  of v onto v noted above, we have our
seeking forms of representatives with respect to our metric  = diag.(,, +   , +).

as a nal step, we move to the classication of the so(10, 2) algebra under the action
of the so(10, 2) group, rather than o(10, 2). more exactly, we classify so(10, 2) under
the subgroup of so(10, 2) generated by the so(10, 2) generators mab, which we denote
as so(10, 2)0. the subgroup is the connected part of so(10, 2) containing the identity
element and its action to an arbitrary element z in so(10, 2) does not change the sign of
the component z00 in (10). the quotient group o(10, 2)/so(10, 2)0 is equal to z2  z2.
one of z2s corresponds to the sign of determinant, while another z2 indicates that
so(10, 2), or more generally so(q, p), has two connected parts. the two connected

11

parts are distinguished by the sign of the principal minor of the time components of
  so(q, p) [12]. in so(10, 2), we have the condition (0
0)2  1, where
the positive sign of the determinant corresponds to so(10, 2)0. we choose an element d
(c) in o(10, 2) which has the negative (positive) determinant and the positive (negative)
principal minor for the time components. if the action of c and d on a representative
z in a type  in o(10, 2),

is non-trivial, then the type  splits into four distinct types (d,c )  (d,c )z, (d, c =
1) under so(10, 2)0. some  may split into only two types (d,+) ((+,c )) if z  
is invariant under the c (d) action, while some  may be invariant under so(10, 2)0.

with the description noted above, we give all types , i.e., conjugacy classes of the
so(10, 2) algebra under the so(10, 2)0 action and nd possible bps congurations coming
from the types.

3.3 so(2, 2) case

3.3.1 so(2, 2) conjugacy classes

before studying the full so(10, 2) case, we demonstrate the classication of its so(2, 2)
part. we will see that almost possible bps states arise from this part. for the so(2, 2)
group, it is known that its associated lie algebra has the decomposition so(2, 2) 
sl(2, r)l  sl(2, r)r. we take the bases {hi, ei, fi} for each sl(2, r)i satisfying

[hi, ei] = ei ,

[hi, fi] = fi ,

[ei, fi] = 2hi ,

{hi, ei, fi} and ki.

3.3.2 (2+2)d bps states

having obtained all non-equivalent representatives in so(2, 2), we substitute them into
the rhs of (21) and calculate the characteristic polynomial,

d(x) = det .({q, q}  xi64) ,

(44)

for the 64  64 matrix {q, q}. we also denote the characteristic polynomial for the
weyl-projected 32  32 matrix {q , q } as dw (x). note that eigenvalues of {q, q} do

not depend on the choice of a particular representative of types in so(2, 2). as mentioned
in sec. 2, by the positivity condition, the eigenvalues must be non-negative.
in the
following, we show only the cases which satisfy the positivity condition.

2(h1 + h2)kl + 1

[i] s2 = 1
with the form of s2, (21) becomes

2(h1  h2)kr

{q, q} = h1i64  h200910 ,

(45)

with its characteristic polynomial,

d(x) = (dw (x))2 ,

dw (x) = (x  (h1 + h2))16(x  (h1  h2))16 ,

(46)

where h1 = z00  0. the bound h1  |h2| is imposed by the positivity condition. a bps
state arises if and only if the bound is saturated, i.e., h1 = |h2|, in which the fraction of
survived supersymmetries is 1/2. in this case, the eigenspinor  of {q, q} with zero
eigenvalue satises

00910 =  ,

(47)

where the sign +() is for positive (negative) h2. from (47), it is natural to interpret
the s2 case as the conguration of an extended object in the (0, 0, 9, 10) directions, which
we call super (2+2)-brane. we note that s3 and s4 cases with the positivity condition
reduce to the bps saturated conguration in the s2 case.

let us check how the (2+2)-brane is reduced to other branes in m-theory and type
iia theory by the dimensional reduction described in sec. 2.3. the condition (47) with,
say, the sign  in the rhs becomes under the weyl projection,

0910 =  ,

14

(48)

where  is a chiral part of  with  = . (48) shows that the dimensionally reduced
super (2+2)-brane is nothing a supermembrane extended in the (0, 9, 10) directions. the
further dimensional reduction of the spatial 10-direction yields the type iia fundamental
string conguration in the (0, 9) directions, characterized by the condition

09l = l ,

09r = r ,

(49)

where l(r) is a chiral part of  with chirality +1 (1) with respect to the (9+1)d
chirality matrix 10.

on the other hand, under dimensional reduction to (9+1)d with the iib projection

in sec. 2.4, (47) becomes

09l = l ,

09r = r ,

(50)

where the eigenspinor  is decomposed as  = (r, l) with 10l(r) = l(r). it is known
that (50) can be derived from (49), upon compactication to (8+1)d, by the t-duality
transformation and corresponds to the (9+1)d type iib fundamental string.

[ii] n1+ = el + er
in this nilpotent case, z00 = z09 = 1 and the others zero. then (21) takes the form,

{q, q} = i64 + 90 ,

with

d(x) = (dw (x))2 ,

dw (x) = x16(x  2)16 .

(51)

(52)

this n1+ case also yields a bps state with 1/2 surviving supersymmetries. the bps
state, however, seems rather dierent from the one in the s2 case, since, from (52), the
former is denitely bps saturated without any non-bps excited conguration.
it is
caused by the fact that the nilpotent zab is parameter independent.

let us see how the bps state is observed after the dimensional reduction to m-
theory.
(52) indicates that the reduced state in m-theory is still bps with 1/2-susy,
which has a non-zero t09 charge in the algebra (14).
in [11], it was argued that the
dual of t09 corresponds to a charge of the m9 brane extended in the (0, 1,   , 8, 10)
directions. subsequently, in [13], the target space solution for the m9 brane was found
to be a domain wall solution of the massive (10+1)d supergravity.

under another dimensional reduction to (9+1)d, the (10+2)d bps state does not
in this reduction, z00 becomes the

reduce to any bps state in the type iib theory.

15

energy p0 in (9+1)d, while z09 does not appear in the algebra (17). hence the reduced
state is interpreted as a non-bps massive particle in the type iib theory.

[iii] m3+ = el + hkr
the characteristic polynomial in this semisimple+nilpotent case becomes

d(x) = (dw (x))2 ,

dw (x) = x8(x  2h)16(x  2)8 .

(53)

the eigenvalues of the matrix {q, q} are x = 0, 2, 2h and thus the parameter h must be
positive. as the number of zero eigenvalues is 8, this m3+ case corresponds to a bps
state with 1/4-susy. in the case of h = 0, which is the nilpotent n3+ case, there arise 16
additional zero eigenvalues and the fraction of surviving supersymmetries becomes 3/4.
these fractions 1/4 and 3/4 remain unchanged under the weyl projection. the m3+
case reduces to the 1/4-susy conguration with p0 = h + 1/2, p10 = 1/2, y09 = 1/2,
y910 = h  1/2 and the others zero in the m-algebra (14). since, as noted in [i], [ii], y910
and y09 are identied with m2 and m9 brane charges, it would be possible to interpret
the conguration as a composite state of these branes. it is needed to investigate whether
the interpretation is also applicable to the n3+ case, or not.

under the type iib projection, the m3+ case reduces to the iib state with p0 =
h + 1/2, z 11
9 = h  1/2 and the others zero in the algebra (17). it is obvious
that the bps bound in the type iib theory can not be saturated unless the parameter h
equals to zero. thus the 1/4-susy bps state in the m3+ case corresponds to a non-bps
string state, while the n3+ case gives a 1/2-susy bps string state.

9 =  z 22

[iv] m4+ = hkl + er
this case and the n4+ = er case can be obtained by exchanging the subscripts l  r
in [iii]. all of results on possible bps states in the m4+ (n4+) case are the same as ones
in the m3+ (n3+) case, except that the signs of z010 and z910 are opposite to those in
[iii]. hence, through the weyl projection, we have 1/4 and 3/4-susy states in [iii] with
the opposite signs of p10 and y910, while, through the iib projection, we obtain string
states in [iii] with the opposite sign of z ii
9 .

the above s2, n3+ and n4+ cases were previously discussed in [14]. in summary, we

give the list of all possible bps states in table 3.

3.4 so(10, 2) case

finally we show the classication of the full so(10, 2) case. all types  in so(10, 2) can
be divided into two cases; [i] the so(2, 2) part in sec. 3.3 plus the remaining so(8) part
and [ii] other cases which can not be decomposed as in [i].

[i] so(2, 2) part + so(8) part
since the group so(8) is compact, all types  in this case are given by the sum of types
in so(2, 2) and the so(8) type with the canonical form as its representative,

so(10,2) = so(2,2) +

6

xk=3

+
0 (ihk,ihk) ,

(54)

where dim.so(10,2) = 12 and ind.so(10,2) = 2, as dim.+
0 = 0. a
representative for each type so(10,2) is therefore obtained by arranging a representative
of each so(2,2) and four 2 2 anti-symmetric blocks ihk2 (k = 3, 4, 5, 6) on the diagonal
part.

0 = 2 and ind.+

6

xk=3

ihk2

[i-1] s2(h1, h2) +
this case with s2 in sec. 3.3 corresponds to the (10+2)d canonical form and is naturally
interpreted as the conguration of super (2+2)-branes extended in timelike (0, 0)- and
spacelike (1,2)-, (3,4)-, (5,6)-, (7,8)-, (9,10)-directions. the calculation of the character-
istic polynomial gives

25

d(x) =

(h1  h2  h3  h4  h5  h6  x)2 ,
y

(55)

where h1 = z00  0 and the above expression means the product of all possible combi-
nations of the signs . since the total number of combinations equals to 25 = 32, the
rhs of (55) becomes a polynomial of order 64 of the parameter x, as expected.

17

it is easy to evaluate all possible fractions of survived supersymmetries in (55). at
rst, let parameters hi (i = 2,   , 6) be non-zero. then the unique minimal eigenvalue
among x = h1  h2  h3  h4  h5  h6 is

xmin.  h1  |h2|  |h3|  |h4|  |h5|  |h6| ,

and thus, from the positivity condition, we have the bound,

h1  |h2| + |h3| + |h4| + |h5| + |h6| .

(56)

(57)

a bps state arises when the bound is saturated and, as each eigenvalue enters twice in
the rhs of (55), the fraction of surviving supersymmetry is 1/32. next, we suppose that
one of parameters, say h6, is zero. in this case, two eigenvalues xmim. and xmim. + 2|h6|
become minimal and hence we have a bps state with 1/16-susy. more generally, we
obtain a 1/32, 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2-susy bps state if the number of zero his is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
respectively.

bps states in the n = (1, 0) superalgebra can be found by taking the weyl projection

of d(x),

24

dw (x) =

(h1  h2  h3  h4  h5  h6  x)2 ,

y:even

(58)

where all combinations with even number of negative signs are taken in the rhs. here,
we should be careful for nding zero eigenvalues, since the minimal value xmin. in (56)
may or may not be contained in the rhs of (58). the complete classication of bps
states in this weyl-projected case has been done in [15].

(58) and other eigenvalues are obtained by adding 2|hi1| + 2|hi2| or 2p4

if one of hi (i = 2,   , 6) is zero, xmin. always belongs to the set of eigenvalues in
q=1 |hiq| to xmin..
as in the case (55), we can easily count the number of eigenvalues equal to xmin. and
obtain a bps state with 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2-susy, when the number of zero his is 1, 2, 3, 4,
respectively. on the other hand, let us suppose all hi to be non-zero. if xmin. is contained
in (58), then xmin. is the unique minimal eigenvalue and its associated bps state has the
1/16-susy.
if xmin. is not in (58), the minimal eigenvalue in (58) is given by adding
some +2|hk| to xmin., where the parameter hk is supposed to have a minimal absolute
value among his.
if there are q his with the minimal absolute value, the fraction of
survived supersymmetry becomes q/16 (q = 1,   , 5) when the bps bound is saturated.
in summary, in the (10+2)d n=(1,0) superalgebra, there arise 1/16, 1/8, 3/16, 1/4, 5/16
and 1/2-susy bps states from the second-rank central term.

there also appear types  in so(10, 2) with n1+, m3+, n3+, m4+ and n4+ in the so(2, 2)

m4+ : d(x) = dw (x)dw (x) ,

dw (x) = dw (x) in m3+ , dw (x) = dw (x) in m3+ .

n3+ and n4+ cases are obtained by setting h = 0 in the m3+ and m4+ cases, respectively.
from (59), (60), (61), it can be shown that all hk (k = 3, 4, 5, 6) in the so(8) part have
to be zero in all above cases to preserve the positivity condition. therefore, unlike the
[i-1] case, no further fractions of survived supersymmetry can be obtained by adding the
parameters hk.

[ii] other so(10, 2) cases
adding to the types in [i], there arise two types in the classication of so(10, 2) which con-
tain indecomposable types with the dimension higher than four, that is, (d,c )2 (ih,ih)
with dim. = 6 and ind. = 2, and (+,c )+

4 (0) with dim. = 5 and ind. = 2.

[ii-1] (d)f1 = (d,+)2 (ih,ih) +
the type 2 (ih,ih) under o(10, 2) splits into four distinct parts under the action of

which act on a representative of 2 (ih,ih) given in (75) and yield the represen-
tative (d,c )z of the type d,c )2 (ih,ih) with respect to the (4+2)d at metric
 = (,, +, +, +, +),

where c = +1 (1) corresponds to the range h > 0 (< 0), showing the c = +1 case
to be compatible with the positivity condition. arranging the matrix (d,+)z and ihk2
(k = 2, 3, 4) on the diagonal part, we obtain a representative of the type (d)f1 with
respect to our (10+2)d at metric ab. the characteristic polynomial for the type is

d(x) = dw (x)dw (x) ,

4

dw (x) = d=1(x) , dw (x) = d=1(x) ,

d =

(x  3h + d(h2  h3  h4))2 

((x  h  d(h2  h3  h4))2(x + h + d(h2  h3  h4))  4x)2 .

(64)

it can be shown that, for any values of h, h2, h3 and h4, there appears, at least, one
negative eigenvalue from the cubic polynomial part of the parameter x in the last line
of (64). therefore the type (d)f1 can not be used to dene anti-commutators among
supercharges.

showing c = 1 to be forbidden by the positivity condition. we obtain a representative
of the type f2 with respect to the (10+2)d at metric ab by arranging the matrix (+)z
and ihk2 (k = 2, 3, 4) on the diagonal block. the characteristic polynomial in this f2
case becomes

d(x) = (dw (x))2 ,

dw (x) =

((x2  2  (h2  h3  h4)2)(x(x  2)  (h2  h3  h4)2)

(66)

as in the [ii-1] case, for any values of h2, h3 and h4, we have, at least, one negative
eigenvalue as a solution of the fourth order equation of the parameter x in the rhs of
(66). hence the type f2 can not be used for the denition of anti-commutators among
supercharges.

with the above two cases, the classication of the so(10, 2) algebra under so(10, 2)0
has been completed and all possible bps states arising from the central term zab have
been exhausted.

4 conclusion

in summary, we have studied the n = (1, 1) non-poincare superalgebra in (10+2)d
with tensorial central terms z (k) (k = 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11). the weyl-projected form of
the algebra, i.e., the n = (1, 0) superalgebra, has been shown to be reduced to the
(10+1)d m-algebra by a timelike dimensional reduction, just as the m-algebra is reduced
to the (9+1)d type iia algebra by a spacelike dimensional reduction. another so(9, 1)
covariant projection of the n = (1, 1) algebra with dimensional reduction to (9+1)d has
also been demonstrated to yield the type iib algebra.

from the complete classication of the second-rank central term, we have exhausted
all possible bps states arising from this term. a 1/2-susy bps state is associated with the
semisimple s2 type in so(2, 2) and is naturally interpreted as a super (2+2)-brane, which
is dimensionally reduced to a membrane in (10+1)d and type iia and iib fundamental
strings in (9+1)d. further fractions less than 1/2 of surviving supersymmetries have
been obtained from the extension of the s2 type to the canonical type in so(10, 2). there
has arisen another 1/2-susy bps state from the nilpotent n1+ type in so(2, 2), which
would be observed as an m9 brane in m-theory. the nilpotent type has been caused
due to the non-compact property of the group so(10, 2). thus the further investigation

21

of the type might give some insight or constraint on the number of time directions of
spacetime. we also have obtained the fraction 1/4 of surviving supersymmetries in m3+
and m4+ types and the fraction 3/4 in n3+ and n4+ types. as discussed in sec. 3.3.2
[iii], if bps states with these fractions of supersymmetry can possibly exist in m-theory,
they would be realized as some composite states of m2 and m9 branes. it is intriguing
to investigate whether there exist (10+1)d supergravity solutions corresponding to those
bps states, or not.

besides the second-rank central term, the consideration of other central terms leads
us to other various brane congurations inherent in the (10+2)d superalgebra. among
them, the sixth-rank central term z (6) represents a super (6+2) brane, which is dimen-
sionally reduced to a m5 brane in m-theory and a ns5 brane in the type iib theory. it
has been discussed that the worldvolume theory of the (2+2)-brane moving in (10+2)d
spacetime is given by (2+2)d self-dual yang-mills and gravitational theories [16]. it is
interesting to study whether the (6+2) brane is described by some (6+2)d integrable
systems like the self-dual theories. a candidate would be a (6+2)d version of the 8d
self-dual yang-mills theory [17] and its gravitational analogue [18].
the method used in this paper to classify the central term z (2)

ab under the so(10, 2)
rotation is also applicable to any second-rank central term in any dimension and signature
of spacetime. an example is the n = (2, 0) chiral superalgebra in (10+2)d, which is a
non-poincare type algebra containing central terms z (2), z, z (4) and self-dual (+)z (6) [4],

i , q

k ab + (a1a6c1) (+)z (6)

(67)

i (i = 1, 2) are majorana-weyl supercharges with the same chirality and  k =
where q
(3, 1, i2). as noted in the introduction, like the n = (1, 1) case, the n = (2, 0) algebra
also reduces to m-, type iia and iib algebras by dimensional reduction. it is interesting
to nd what types of bps states exist in this chiral algebra and to clarify the connection
of them with various bps states in membrane and string theories.

appendix

according to the description of indecomposable types in sec. 3.2.2, we construct explicit
forms of representatives for the types m relevant to our o(10, 2) case. let (z, v )  m
and z be decomposed as the sum of semisimple s and nilpotent n elements, z = s + n,
with n m+1 = 0. the vector space v can be written as v = f + nf +    + n mf ,
where f is the subspace of v spanned by eigenvectors of s. from (22), the metric
m(u, v) =  (u, n mv) for u, v  f is symmetric for m = even and anti-symmetric for
m = odd. for later use, we dene the symmetric, nondegenerate and real bilinear form
 as

m(u, v) = m(u, v)

= m(u, sv)

if m = even,
if m = odd and s 6= 0.

(68)

a-1: 

m(ih,ih)

we can choose a pair of vectors {e, f} spanning the subspace f of v such that se = hf
and sf = he (h  r). from m(su, v) + m(u, sv) = 0, we have (e, f )m = 0 while
m(e, e) = m(f, f ). we have two choices of the sign of m(e, e), which is labeled by the
superscript  = 1 in the type.

a-1-1: m=0

dim. = 2

since n 0+1 = 0, this type contains only a semisimple element z = s. the form of s on
v = f = {e, f} with respect to (w.r.t.) the metric  becomes

as eigenvalues of s are real, we can take eigenvectors {e, f} such that se = he and

to satisfy m(e, f ) = 1.

this type gives a nilpotent z = n with n 2 = 0. let us take two vectors {e, f} in v
as eigenvectors of s, then the vector space v can be spanned by {e, f, ne, nf}. we
can derive 1(e, e) = 1(f, f ) = 0 and take 1(e, f ) equal to +1. the representative
in 1(0, 0) and the metric  derived from the setup are the same as those in (78), (79).

having obtained the above representatives in indecomposable types, we arrange them
on the diagonal part of 12  12 matrix in order to obtain o(10, 2) representatives with
ind. = 2. in general, we have to transform the obtained representatives into the other
forms with respect to our (10+2)d metric  = diag.(,, +,   , +). here we give an ex-
ample in the o(2, 2) case in sec. 3.3.1. let us take the sum  = 0(h1,h1)+0(h2,h2),
which has dim. = 4 and ind. = 2. from sec. a-2-1, we have a representative z for
the type  w.r.t. the metric  = (, +,, +),
