we dene gravitational mass in asymptotically de sitter space-times with compactied dimension.
it was shown that the mass can be negative for space-time with matter spreading beyond the
cosmological horizon scale or large outward momentum in four dimension. we give simple examples
with negative energy in higher dimensions even if the matter is not beyond horizon or system does
not have large momentum. they do not have the lower bound on the mass. we also give a
positive energy argument in higher dimensions and realise that elementary fermion cannot exist in
our examples.

i. introduction

superstring or m-theory may oer the proper theory of gravity [1]. suck kind of theories are formulated in higher

dimensions and it is believed that the extra dimension space will be compactied to be less than planck length.

the stability of such space-times is important and has been discussed. it was shown that there is the instanton
which may indicate the decay of kaluza-klein vacuum [2] [3] [4]. as witten pointed out, the decay mode is excluded
by the existence of (massless) elementary fermion related to supersymmetry [5].

on the other hand, the stability of the asymptotically anti-de sitter(ads) space-time with compactied dimension
has been focused recently by horowitz & myers [6] because ads/cft correspondence [7] links the stability of super-
yang-mills theory to that of ads space-time. so they suggested a positive energy conjecture in locally asymptotically
ads space-times.

in the actual cosmological context, same argument of stability is important. in this paper, for simplicity, we consider
d-dimensional einstein gravity with a positive cosmological constant. a positive cosmological constant is essential
for ination universe [8] and acceleration of universe conrmed gradually by recent observations of supernovae [9]. in
nakao et als study, it was shown that the gravitational mass can be negative in four dimensional space-times when
the matter distributes beyond the cosmological horizon scale [10] [11]. in other words, the mass is negative if the
space-time has a large outward momentum. evaluating the electric part of weyl tensor, they also checked that the
mass is related to gravitational tidal force. in this paper we nd a initial data set whose mass can be negative and
does not have the lower bound even if the space-time does not have momentum. furthermore, we give an other
dynamical solution which also does not have momentum.

in asymptotically at space-times with compactied extra dimensions, there are examples of momentarily static
initial slices such that the energy can be negative regardless of the size of the compactied dimensions [4]. a parallel

argument helps us to discuss about the lower bound of the energy in asymptotically de sitter space-times. since a
positive cosmological constant prompts the rapid expansion of the universe, we might be able to obtain an implication
about the eect to the energy from the dynamics of the compactied dimensions.

the rest of the present paper is organised as follows. in the next section we give the denition of gravitational mass
in asymptotically de sitter space-time with extra dimensions and write down the expression in terms of canonical
quantities on the hypersurfaces. since a part of this is straightforward extension of work by nakao et al [10] based
on [12] [13], we give the brief discussion. we will point out that the expression is a special case of the gravitational
hamiltonian dened by hawking & horowitz [14]. in sec. 3 we show two examples which have negative energy and no
naked singularity. in sec. 4, we consider the positive energy theorem to discuss the stability of de sitter space-time.
as a result we conrm that elementary fermion cannot exist in examples given by us. finally we give summary in
sec. 4.

ii. gravitational mass in asymptotically de sitter space-times with higher

dimensions

we consider d-dimensional space-times which satisfy the einstein equation with a positive cosmological constant

,

rij 

1
2

gij r + gij = 8gdtij ,

(2.1)

where suces i, j runs over 0, 1, ..., d  1, tij is the energy-momentum tensor and gd is d-dimensional newtons
constant. we decompose the space-time metric into the d-dimensional de sitter metric gij and the resthij ;

hereafter the notation over-bar indicates the quantities of the background de sitter space-time. we remember that
hij is not necessarily small, but we impose that it vanishes at innity. we will give a further description below.

here we note that einstein equation is written as

gij = gij + hij .

(2.2)

rij
 

1
2

gijr  hij = (g)1/2t ij ,

(2.3)

where hij = gik gjlhkl, rij
is the linear part of ricci tensor rij with respect to hij and all the higher order terms

are included in t ij of the right-hand side. as the left-hand side of eq. (2.3) satises the bianchi identity, we see that
(2.4)
holds, where i is the covariant derivative with respect to gij . contracting t ij with the killing vector of de sitter
space-time,

it ij = 0

we obtain the local conservation low

t i = t ij j ,

it i = 0.

thus, r dd1xt 0 is conserved if the surface term r dd2sit i vanishes. we dene

ead =

8gd z dd1xt 0k k
8gd z dd2si[ i k 0ijm  k 0jji j] j ,

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

where k ijkl = (1/2)(gilh kj + gkj h il  gikh jl  gjlh ik), h ij = hij  (1/2)gijhk
k and i = 1, 2, ..., d  1.
in the case that i is a timelike killing vector ead is regarded as the killing energy, the so called abbott-deser(ad)
mass.

next, we rewrite eq. (2.7) in more familiar form in order to obtain its physical meaning. first of all, we need
take asymptotic region carefully. in asymptotic at cases, the extrinsic curvature kij of slices has the behaviour

2

k i
j  0 toward the spatial innity i0. as we know, we can expect that such slice does not have asymptotic region in
asymptotically de sitter space-time because static slices with kij = 0 have no boundary in de sitter space-time. so
we remember that the at chart of de sitter space-time has boundary and its spatial metric is conformally at(see
fig. 2 in ref [10]). thus, we realize that the most natural condition is given by k i
j or k  (d  1)h [15],
where h = p2/(d  1)(d  2). in this chart the metric of the background de sitter space-time is written as

j  hi

d1

where a(t) = eht. the killing vector has the component m = (1, hxi). after simple calculations we obtain

g = dt2 + a(t)2

dx2

jij,

(2.8)

(2.9)

where kij is the extrinsic curvature of t =constant (d  1)-dimensional hypersurface. by using the momentum
ij = kij  qij k, where qij is the metric of t =constant hypersurface, the second term in the second line of eq. (2.9)
can be written as

padm( ) = padm( )  padm( ) = 

1

8gd z d si(i

j  i

j) j .

(2.10)

as a result, ead is written in terms of the sum of the adm energy and net momentum. we note that the momentum
of background de sitter space-time is subtracted automatically. the above net momentum is the term momentum
used in introduction. the above argument does not depends on whether extra dimensions is compactied or not.

now we compare the above expression with the gravitational energy dened via physical hamiltonian [14]. the

gravitational energy has expression

ehh = 

1

8gd z ds(n k  n k) +

1

8gd z ds(n iij  n iij )rj ,

(2.11)

where k and ri are the trace of the extrinsic curvature and the unit normal vector of (d  2)-dimensional surface at
the innity, respectively. n and n i are the lapse function and the shift vector.
the physical hamiltonian is dened by the substraction the hamiltonian of a background space-time from the
original hamiltonian. as hawking & horowitz showed, the rst term of eq. (2.11) is just the adm energy. comparing
eq. (2.9) with eq. (2.11), one can see that they have the same expression except for scale factor, i.e, ead = a(t)ehh,
if one chooses the lapse function and the shift vector as follows,

n = n = 1

and

n i = n i =  i.

(2.12)

it is likely that the priority is given to our denition in asymptotically de sitter space-times because the hawking &
horowitzs construction of physical hamiltonian has the operation of articial substraction to keep it nite.

in asymptotically at cases, the adm energy is dened by view point of a static observer with n = 1 and n i = 0
at spatial innity i0. the naturalness of observer selection to dene the energy is related to the timelike translation
symmetry at innity. on the other hand, in asymptotically de sitter space-time, we must consider hypersurfaces
which have innity in order to dene the non-zero energy. as we have done, the most convenient slices is one which
corresponds to the at slices in de sitter space-time. this slices reach into the timelike innity i+(see fig. 2 in
ref. [10]). however, the slices is not associated with the timelike translation symmetry which de sitter space-time
possesses, that is, the slice is not orthogonal to timelike killing vector. thus, it may be natural that the adm
momentum term enters into the expression of the mass.

in four dimension the ad mass can be negative when system has a large outward momentum [10]. on the other
hand, the positivity of the ad or adm mass is guaranteed for systems without the net momentum, padm = 0, in
four dimension [16].

iii. examples in five dimensions

in the same way as four dimensional cases, the ad mass can be negative regardless of the compactication of the
extra dimension if the system has a large momentum. however, the physical reason of the negativity is the dynamics

3

of four dimensional part of space-time, rather than the (quantum) stability. now we are interest in just stability.
so, we consider the situation only where the contribution of the net adm momentum does not exist. we give two
examples in ve dimension which are regular everywhere and have negative energy.

let us consider an initial slice with kij = hgij and h = p/6. in this slice the hamiltonian constraint becomes
(4)r = 0. thus one can use the argument on the momentarily static slices in asymptotically at cases because the
hamiltonian constraint is just same one.

one can see easily that the euclidian reissner-nordstrom metric with imaginary charge ie satises the hamiltonian

constraint [4]. this metric of the hypersurface is given by

(4)g = v (r)d2 +

dr2
v (r)

+ r2d2
2

(3.1)

where v (r) = 1  2m/r  e2/r2 and r  r+ := m + m2 + e2. to avoid a conical singularity at r = r+, we assume

the period p = 4/v (r+) = 2r2

+/(r+  m) along the -direction.

on the present slice, the mass is constructed by only the adm energy component, ead = eadm = mp/2g5 =
m/2. by the same argument as brill & horowitz [4], it is shown that the mass becomes negative and does not have
the lower bound. the mass can be set to be arbitrary negative regardless of the radius of the compactied space.
however, it is not obvious whether the ad energy is conserved or not in the course of time development because of
the existence of the cosmological constant and momentarily non-static slices. in fact we will see that the energy is
not conserved in the next example.

as a second example, we take a dynamical solution [17]. the metric is

ds2 = dt2 + a(t)2h d2



2i,
+ dr2 + r22d2

(3.2)

where (r) = 1  m/r, a(t) = eht and h = p/6. the t =constant hypersurface has the extrinsic curvature
j = hi
k i
j. however, this space-time has timelike naked singularity at r = m. since the expansion of outgoing null
geodesics congruence is

+ =

1

2(cid:16)2h +

4r  m
2a3/2r2(cid:17),

(3.3)

the apparent horizon does not exist in the expanding chart with a = eht. in collapsing chart with a = eht, apparent
horizon also does not exist although surfaces such that + = 0 exists. the curvature invariant is given by

rijklrijkl = 5h 4 + 3hh 2 

m

2a2(r  m)3i2

+hh 2 

m

a2(r  m)3i2

.

(3.4)

to avoid the naked singularity at r = m, we change the sign of the mass parameter, m  m. after that the
radial coordinate r can run up to r = 0 and the conical singularity occurs at r = 0 in general cases. near r = 0, the
metric is written as

ds2  dt2 + a(t)2h r

m

d2 +

m
r

2i.
dr2 + m2d2

here we introduce a new coordinate r = (rm)1/2 and the metric is

ds2  dt2 + a2h4ndr2 + r2d(cid:16) 

2m(cid:17)2o + m2d2
2i.

(3.5)

(3.6)

hence, the metric is regular everywhere except for a = 0 singularity if one assumes the period p = 4m along the
-direction. the physical size of the compactied dimensions is given by 4a(t)m. thus, it decreases/increases if one
takes the collapsing/expanding chart. a cosmological constant make the compactied space dynamical as well as the
four dimensional part. the ad mass is

here we used the fact that the ve dimensional newtons constant is written as g5 = pg4 in term of the four dimensional
one.

e = eadm = 

a(t)3mp

g5

= a3(t)m.

(3.7)

this is not conserved due to the expansion of the universe! this comes from the non-vanishing boundary term

r dd2sit i which vanishes for asymptotically at cases. at rst glance, best we can do might be choosing the

collapsing chart and we can keep the radius of the compactied space to be less than planck length. in the chart,
we observe the value of the energy approaches zero. one may think that a large cosmological constant stabilise
the space-times because the extra dimension shrinks rapidly and the energy becomes zero before space-time decays.
at the same time the shrinking, however, means the big-crunch of the space-time and then this case does not give
attractive model. since there is no reason why one has to choose the collapsing chart a priori, we need consider the
expanding chart too. in this chart, the compactied space expands till the end of the ination and the the absolute
value of the ad energy increases. naively speaking, the decay rate of the de sitter space-time into the space-time
with the large compactied space is suppressed.

iv. positive energy theorem, elementary fermion and stability

in locally asymptotically at cases with compactied dimensions, the break down of positive energy theorem means
non-existence of the witten spinor [5]. in supergravity side, that means there are not supersymmetry because the
spinor is related to innitesimal generator of local supersymmetry [18].

in asymptotically de sitter cases, the situation is dierent from the above. as we stated, the energy can be negative
even if the extra dimension is not compactied and the topology is trivial. in this section, we discuss the positive
energy theorem, based on [16] [19] , in cases whose extra dimension is not compactied. conversely, we can see easily
that the witten spinor cannot exist for examples given in the previous section.

following kastor&traschen [19], we dene the cosmological supercovariant derivative operator on a spinor  as

i  = (cid:16)i +

i
2

hi(cid:17) = (cid:16)i + i +

i
2

hi(cid:17) =: (cid:16)i + 

i(cid:17),

where i is the spin connection,

and ei
j

is quasi-orthogonal basis. the cosmological witten equation is dene by

i = 

1
8

ej ki e

l
j [ l,  k],

i i = 0.

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

the solution is given by a constant spinor 0 satisfying 00 = i0 in the expanding at slice of de sitter space-time.

by using the bianchi identity, the hamiltonian and momentum constraints, we obtain an identity

z dsi i = z dvh| i|2 + 4gd(t00 + ti0i0)i

(4.4)

let us evaluate the left-hand side. we follow wittens argument [21] carefully. first, the constant spinor satises

i i0 = i

i0 = i(d1)i0 +

i
2

[k + (d  1)h]0

(4.5)

the argument in ref. [16] is prototype of the proof. rigourously speaking, the supercovariant derivative dened there is
not covariant for full space-times. the excellent approach bearing supergravity in mind was given in ref. [19]. however, both
papers have not been attained in the present rened form. the explicit evaluation of the left-hand side of eq. (4.4) has not
done yet in ref. [19]. see ref. [20] for asymptotically ads space-times.
 the vector i = i  dened by spinor  satisfying i  = 0 is conformal killing vector, not killing vector in de sitter
space-time. that it,  is a conformal killing spinor, not killing spinor. this point is the main reason why one cannot prove
the positivity of the ad mass for asymptotically de sitter space-times having the net momentum because the left-hand side of
eq. (4.4) cannot be the ad mass.

(4.9)

under the dominant energy condition [22] on the energy-momentum tensor tij . unfortunately, we cannot say some-
thing about e = 0 case because witten spinor approaching to 0 at innity is uniquely determined. thus, there is
not contradiction with the existence of non-trivial solution which has zero adm mass and is given in ref. [10].

we can see that e is not equal to the ad mass, ead. when k i

j = o(1/rd1) holds and the momentum term of
the ad mass vanishes, the ad mass equals to the adm energy and the positivity is guaranteed. for our purpose,
it is worth imposing k i
j = o(1/rd1) because we are interest in the stability of space-time, not its dynamics. as
eq. (4.9) this implies the positivity of the ad mass. the apparent contradiction with examples given in the previous
section indicates that the witten spinor does not exist in such examples.

v. summary

in this paper we dened the gravitational mass in asymptotically de sitter space-time with extra dimensions and
obtained a rened expression related to the adm energy and momentum associated to the timelike killing vector
of the background de sitter space-time. furthermore, we gave one dynamical solution and one initial data with the
negative energy in ve dimensions. does these solution indicate the quantum decay of de sitter space-time? we
cannot reply to the question instantly because we do not know whether the instanton exists or not. naively speaking,
we can guess from the previous section that the decay occurs unless one imposes the existence of elementary fermion
or supersymmetry.

finally, we should stress the fact that the energy seems to depend on the time in general although the denition is

reasonable. this means that the contribution from the boundary is not negligible.

in asymptotically at space-times, 0 is arbitrary constant spinor. this means the existence of ds independent solution of
witten equation. as a result, we obtain rijkl = 0 from 0 = [i, j] = (1/4)rijkl[k , l].
