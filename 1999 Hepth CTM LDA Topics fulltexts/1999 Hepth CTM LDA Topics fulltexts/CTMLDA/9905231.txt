(17) (18) (19) reason introducing operators become clear proceed. vectors satisfying (19) subspace total space vector elds denoted v . let us rst show l1 l2 well dened operators subspace: l1 : v v, l2 : v v. verify this, start curvature identity (ab ba)c kd = rabc contract gbc gad obtain eekd + rabd ecke, a2ka babka = 0. 8 (20) (21) (22) (23) now, another curvature identity together einstein equations (9) give: abka = baka l2kb. (24) using second term (23), one obtains (for arbitrary vector eld ka), a2ka = 2aka l2bkb. (25) ka v aka = 0 equation gives a2ka = 0. case, denitions l1 l2 imply: a(l1ka) = 0, a(l2ka) = 0, (26) (27) showing l1ka v l2ka v ka v . veries l1 l2 well dened operators v . introduce following inner product vector space v : < k|l >=zm gabkalb. (28) general, vectors v well dened inner products. thus, boundary conditions imposed eliminate vector elds. fact that, r large, volume form grows like rp asymptotic behavior metric xed previous section suggest following boundary conditions components ka (in x, r coordinates): kr = o( 1 rp/2+2 ), k = o( 1 rp/2 ). (29) redef ine v space divergence free vector elds obeying boundary conditions. redenition, inner product (28) becomes well dened v . note v kernel elliptic operator acting one-forms. due fact, assume v satises axioms hilbert spaces rigorously. also assume r-derivatives components fall one power faster. let us show l1 l2 hermitian operators v . requires vanishing following surface integral, zm nakb(alb) = 0, 9 (30) vectors ka, la v , na unit normal . volume form grows like rp+1 large r. using expression (12) unit normal vector, asymptotic behavior metric boundary conditions (29) obeyed vector elds ka la, one check integrand vanishes r . then, (30) implies, upon integration parts, turn proves l1 l2 hermitian operators v : zm ka2la = zm la2ka, < k|l1l >=< l1k|l >, < k|l2l >=< l2k|l > . (31) (32) (33) boundary conditions imposed obtain well dened inner product turn sucient make l1 l2 hermitian. determine asymptotic behavior vector eld ka v satises l1ka = 0 l2ka = 0. start fact that, r large components ka become: 1 rm ), 1 rn ), k = o( kr = o( n (34) + 2, p 2 . p 2 nd possible values n, one expand components powers 1/r (which done r suciently large): kr = k = f (x) rm + f(x) rn + g(x) rm+1 + ..., g(x) rn+1 + .... (35) (36) plugging expansions dierential equations, one group terms according powers 1/r solve equations order order. lowest order equations, sometimes called indicial equations, determine constants n. large r, components 2ka calculated (we set inverse radius = 1 on): 2kr = r22 r kr + 1 r2 kr + kr + (p + 4)rrkr 1 +o( rp+m+1 ) + o( 2 r3 k rp+n+2 ), 1 (37) (38) 2k = r22 r k + 1 r2 k (p + 1)k + prrk + 2rkr rp+m2 ), rp+n+1 ) + o( +o( 1 1 10 suppressed terms, arise due deviation metric ads soliton background, aect indicial equation. terms 1 r2 kr 1 r2 k, appeared (37) (38), contribute higher order equations, even though survive deviation background zero. thus, also ignored nding possible values n. fact vector elds divergence free, aka = 0, gives following relation among components: r2rkr + (p + 2)rkr + 1 r2 k + o( 1 rp+m ) + o( 1 rp+n+1 ) = 0, (39) suppressed terms higher powers 1/r compared ones written. now, using (39) last term (37), one show lowest order 1/r equations, obtained r-components dierential equations l1ka = 0 l2ka = 0, give following quadratic equations m: l1ka = 0 m2 (p + 3)m + (p + 4) = 0, l2ka = 0 m2 (p + 3)m + (3p + 6) = 0. (40) (41) fortunately, terms constant n turn higher order nally end equations m. vector elds satisfying l1ka = 0, constant following values. m1 = 1, m2 = p + 4. (42) rst root acceptable since consistent boundary conditions imposed vector elds. thus, set = p + 4. using (38) -component equation l1ka = 0, one obtain quadratic equation n, n2 (p 1)n (2p + 2) = 0, (43) single positive root n = p + 1. therefore, solutions l1ka = 0, ka v , fall like: kr = o( k = o( (44) 1 rp+4 ), 1 rp+1 ). vector elds obeying l2ka = 0, roots read (41) as: m1 = 3, m2 = p + 2. (45) rst root acceptable cases p > 1, since consistent boundary conditions, roots become equal p = 1. therefore, set 11 = p + 2. then, (38) used -component l2ka = 0, obtain following quadratic equation n: n2 (p 1)n = 0. (46) single positive root n = p 1 therefore solutions l2ka = 0, ka v , become large r (47) kr = o( k = o( 1 rp+2 ), 1 rp1 ). till xed boundary conditions ensure operators l1 l2 hermitian determined asymptotic behavior zero modes. try obtain information zero modes, since nal aim use operators solving certain dirichlet problems possibly imply existence killing vectors. would nice operators l1 l2 turned invertible i.e. zero modes. case l1, l2 able determine zero modes. proceed showing hermitian dierential operator l1 zero modes. ka v , fact divergence free (24) give used rewrite equation l1ka = 0 as: abka = l2kb, contract equation kb integrate : a(akb + bka) = 0. zm kba(akb + bka) = 0. (48) (49) (50) integrating parts, one easily obtain, vector eld satisfying l1ka = 0 aka = 0, 1 2 zm (akb + bka)(akb + bka) +zm nakb(akb + bka) = 0. (51) now, vector elds v fall like (44) obey l1ka = 0. ensures surface integrals vanish turn implies, akb + bka = 0, (52) since remaining integrand (51) nowhere negative. therefore, ka killing vector. asymptotics (44), ka akb vanishes . however, 12 well known killing eld derivative vanish point, killing eld vanishes everywhere . thus ka = 0 l1 zero modes given boundary conditions. let us try learn zero modes operator l2. simply repeat steps, obtain relation like (52). using (48), equation l2ka = 0 rewritten as, a(akb bka) = 0. (53) rst contract equation kb integrate . then, inte- grating parts, obtain vector eld satisfying l2ka = 0 aka = 0: (54) (akb bka)(akb bka) +zm nakb(akb bka) = 0. 1 2 zm surface integrals vanish due asymptotic behavior (47). remaining integrand positive denite implies akb bka = 0. (55) therefore zero modes hermitian operator l2 closed one-forms. since aka = 0 also co-closed thus harmonic one-forms. one obtain information zero modes recalling closed one-form written linear combination exact one-form rst cohomology classes manifold . cohomology classes related topology manifold. case, assumed that, outside compact region, topology become globally ads soliton i.e. p s1 times real line (the coordinate r). therefore, near asymptotic region, rst cohomology classes spanned 5 one-forms dx. however, forms cannot zero modes l2 since obey boundary conditions imposed vector elds belonging v . show moment exact forms also excluded. therefore, zero modes l2 harmonic representatives rst cohomology classes interior compact region. see exact forms cannot zero modes l2 write ka = af , function f . asymptotic behavior zero modes l2 determined 5in interior region topology may change one-forms dx become also exact. case, instance, one-form solution (8). 13 (47), f behave large r like, f = o( 1 rp+1 ). (56) since ka also divergence free, f satisfy laplace equation: 2f = 0. however, solution laplace equation obeys (56) zero. easily seen nothing following relation valid function obeying laplace equation: 0 = zm f2f = zm (af )(af ) +zm naf (af ). (57) last surface integral vanishes due behavior (56) f large r. since remaining integrand right side positive denite, one obtains af = 0. therefore, f constant constant vanishes since f vanishes r . shows exact forms excluded list zero modes l2. laplacian studied properties dierential operators acting divergence free vector elds, nally turn space functions. let w space square integrable functions endowed following inner product, < f|g >= zm f g. (58) inner product well dened, since functions w obey large r (due square integrability): f w f = o( 1 rp/2+1 ). (59) dierential operator consider w laplacian. one easily check that, due asymptotic behavior functions determined above, 2 hermitian operator < f|2g >=< 2f|g > . (60) before, try determine zero modes 2 see invertible w . asymptotic behavior zero modes determined calculating 2f = r22 r f + 1 r2 f (p + 2)rrf + o( 1 rp+m+1 ), (61) f = o(1/rm). indicial equation follows formula reads m(m + 1) (p + 2)m = 0. (62) 14 solution consistent boundary condition (59) = p + 1. therefore, zero modes 2 w fall like 1/rp+1. however, repeating arguments used show exact forms cannot zero modes l2, one easily see zero modes actually zero. therefore laplacian 2 invertible operator w . 4 existence harmonic functions commuting killing vectors previous section considered two vector spaces v w , endowed well dened inner products, studied properties dierential operators l1, l2 2. shown operators hermitian determined zero modes. operators l1 2 shown zero modes thus invertible. section try use operators show existence harmonic functions killing vectors. existence harmonic functions although 2 zero modes w , may solutions 2f = 0, f 6 w . consider following dirichlet problem (63) r , 2f = 0, f bixi bi arbitrary constants. note index runs 1 2. since coordinates xi periodically identied period l, function f well dened nite l. however, constant l free parameter one let l . indeed, discussed section 2, limit corresponds ads soliton. hand one cannot include coordinate (63) since period xed ( corresponds either compactication scale inverse temperature boundary conformal eld theory). note also f 6 w . solve dirichlet problem rst dene trial function near asymptotic boundary (where coordinates x r well dened) becomes = bixi. smoothly extend zero interior regions (where coordinates x r may well dened) thus obtain well dened function . nd solution (63) writing f = l + t, solving l obeying 2l = 2t, l 0 r . (64) 15 using (61), one check 2t = o(1/rp+2) w 6 thus unique solution l w , since 2 invertible. (59), l = o(1/rp/2+1). obtain accurate information asymptotic behavior l, expand large r l = f (x) rm + g(x) rm+1 + .... p 2 + 1. (65) now, (61) implies lowest order terms 2l fall like 1/rm. since l obeys (64), terms either cancel equal order terms coming right hand side. thus, either obey indicial equation (62) = p + 1 = p + 2. implies, least, l = o(1/rp+1) which, furthermore, gives following solution dirichlet problem (63): f = bixi + o( 1 rp+1 ). (66) one also try solve l constructing greens function, g(r, r), 2. asymptotic behavior g(r, r) deduced asymptotics possible zero modes since obeys laplace equation except singular points. inverting (64) l(r) = r g(r, r)2t(r) letting r , one nds l = o(1/rp+1) thus f asymptotic behavior (66). since f obeys 2f = 0, harmonic function df = 0. note also one-form df also harmonic (d + d)df = 0, adjoint d. hand, since construction introduced arbitrary constants bi, actually 2 independent harmonic functions. denote harmonic function obtained choice b = (0, 0, ..1, 0..0) f(i), b ith entry one. valid instanton solutions. existence killing vectors hermitian operator l1 invertible v . however, may solutions l1ka = 0, ka divergence free vector eld belong v . let us try see following dirichlet problem solution, l1ka = 0, aka = 0 kr 0, k a, r , (67) arbitrary constants. note that, contravariant components vector eld xed boundary. hand, covariant components 6one may naively claim (61) (by setting = 0) 2t = o(1/rp+1). however, carefull analysis shows o(1/rp+1) terms cancel (61) implies 2t = o(1/rp+2). 16 become, example, k = o(r2) shows ka 6 v. solve problem, rst dene trial vector eld ta following prop- erties. near asymptotic boundary, components t(x, r) smooth functions coordinates x, r vanish r < r become exactly ar2 r > r+, r r+ suciently large numbers r < r+. component function, tr(x, r), dened zero r < r chosen give ata = 0 r > r. extend ta zero trough interior regions, coordinates x r may well dened. gives us well dened divergence free vector eld . introduce new vector eld la writing desired solution (67) as: ka = la + ta. (68) construction trial vector eld ta, one solve dirichlet problem (67) working solutions la of, l1la = l1ta, la 0, r . (69) show l1ta v p > 3. since l1 invertible operator v , unique solution (69) la v . give unique solution dirichlet problem (67) p > 3. -component trial vector eld xed construction. let us determine behavior tr large r. mentioned above, tr chosen obtain divergence free vector eld, thus satises rst order dierential equation. using (39) components ta, obtain large r tr = o( 1 rp ). (70) using (37) (38), one see that, l1ta, terms come background contain constants cancel other. remaining terms determined fall like (l1t)r = o( 1 rp ), (l1t) = o( 1 rp1 ). (71) shows l1ta v p > 3, since obeys boundary conditions (29) range. mentioned above, l1 inverted obtain unique 17 solution la v . therefore, components la obey least (29). however, need accurate information asymptotic behavior la. obtain information, start fact large r: lr = o( 1 rm ), l = o( 1 rn ), p 2 + 2, p 2 , n (72) expand components like (35). lowest order terms r-component l1la seen fall like 1/rm. stage two possibilities; terms may cancel may equal order terms coming right hand side (69) i.e. (l1t)r. terms cancel other, satisfy exactly indicial equation (40) obtained zero modes. case = p + 4, (l1l)r term cancel lowest order terms coming (l1t)r. thus second possibility true. asymptotic behavior (l1t)r implies = p lr = o(1/rp). arguments repeated -components obtain: lr = o( 1 rp ), l = o( 1 rp1 ). (73) shows unique solution l1ka = 0, aka = 0, given ka = la + ta, asymptotically becomes (contravariant components): kr = o( 1 rp2 ), k = + o( 1 rp+1 ). (74) note that, able solve dirichlet problem, forced impose p > 3 i.e. dimension greater 5. try establish (74) killing vector. show this, one use equation (51), valid vector eld obeying l1ka = 0 aka = 0. surface integral (51) vanishes, one akb + bka = 0, since remaining terms (51) positive denite. one contribution surface integral, coming nrk(kr + rk), vanish. since volume form grows like rp+1, nr = o(r) k = o(1), surface integral integral term vanishes kr + rk = o( 1 rp+3 ). (75) however, one easily check condition satised solution (74) dirichlet problem. solution (74) obeys, instead, kr + rk = o(1/rp), shows surface integral may vanish general. note x 18 already asymptotic killing vector eld possible instanton like solution. see spaces surface integral vanishes, let us concentrate class instanton solutions obeying restrictive boundary conditions h = o( 1 rp+2 ), hr = o( 1 rp+3 ), hrr = o( 1 rp+6 ). (76) compared asymptotic behavior (13), metrics family fall three power r faster. order take account dierence previous formulas, one simply shift p 3. implies dirichlet problem (67) solved dimensions solution (74) becomes asymptotically kr = o( 1 rp+1 ), k = + o( 1 rp+4 ). (77) plugging (77) identity (51), one see surface integrals van- ish. therefore, (77) indeed killing vector. othar hand, since constants completely arbitrary, actually p + 1 independent killing vectors. denote killing vector eld obtained choice = (0, 0..1, ..0) k(s)a p + 1 1 sth entry one. remind reader proof applies family (76). dening za a = k(s)bbk(s) k(s)bbk(s) , (78) one easily show killing vectors family also commute. asymp- totic behavior (77) implies zr = o( 1 rp+3 ), z = o( 1 rp+2 ). (79) since commutator two killing vectors killing vector, za killing vector. killing vector asymptotic behavior, za v l1za = 0. however, since l1 invertible, za = 0. thus killing vectors commute other. operator l2 studied dirichlet problems related operators l1 2. discussed, existence solutions imply existence certain geometric properties. another operator, l2, studied section 2 considered yet context dirichlet problems. since hermitian dierential 19 operator l2 invertible v , one cannot naively solve dirichlet problem using l2 (at least following steps discussed far). seems one also make topological assumptions obtain invertible operator. here, simply note one-forms af(i) divergence free also eigenvectors l2 zero eigenvalue, l2af(i) = 0. note also af(i) 6 v . relation k(i) df(i) conclude section showing one killing vectors duals harmonic one-forms df(i): k(i)aaf(i) = i. (80) note r = killing vector k(i)a function f(i) equal xi, respectively. prove (80), using (ak(i) xi b) = 0, l1k(i)a = 0 l2af(i) = 0, calculate 2(cid:16)k(i)aaf(i)(cid:17) = (cid:16)2k(i)a(cid:17)af(i) + k(i)a(cid:16)2af(i)(cid:17) + 2(cid:16)bk(i)a(cid:17)(cid:16)baf(i)(cid:17) = 0, (81) shows functions k(i)aaf(i) obey laplace equation. one use (57) valid function obeying laplace equation. focus surface integrals. one writes g = k(i)aaf(i), using asymptotic behavior (77) (66) k(i)a f(i), respectively, one obtain then, surface integrals (57), obtained plugging g into, written g = + o( 1 rp+1 ). (82) explicitly as: izm naag +zm o( 1 rp+1 )naag. (83) rst term integrals vanishes since written integral 2g zero, second integral vanishes since volume form grows like rp+1, na = o(r), ag = o(1/rp+1) imply integrand vanishes r . therefore, surface integrals vanish (57). remaining integrand (57) positive denite implies ag = 0. therefore, g constant constant since g reaches value r . proves (80), turn shows killing vectors k(i) one-forms df(i) cannot vanish point. thus, one killing vectors xed points act freely. fact important since enables one choose global coordinates adapted killing vectors, functions f(i) case. 20 5 conclusions paper tried obtain certain geometric properties ads instantons. determining asymptotic behavior metric, studied certain hermitian dierential operators, dened suitable hilbert spaces. using op- erators, shown d-dimensional instanton 2 harmonic functions. class instatons, also proved existence 1 com- muting killing vectors. furhermore, one killing vectors shown xed points. results may usuful proving semiclassical stability ads soliton. believe existence proof killing vectors family (76) generalized instanton solutions choosing appropriate trial vector elds solving dirichlet problem corresponding l1. could done, one introduce globally well dened coordinates adapted killing vectors act manifold freely, try solve einstein equations coordinates attempt obtain possible instanton solutions. existence instanton solution necessarily imply ads soliton semiclassically unstable. solution may well describe decay an- unstable state ads soliton. see ground state semiclassically unstable, one study quadratic uctuations around instanton solution. negative action modes may arise quadratic approximation sign semiclassical instability. proofs semiclassical stability minkowski space positive energy theorem asymptotically spaces given , hermitian operators greens functions played crucial role. operators introduced paper may also useful studying positive energy conjecture horowitz myers. present paper, metric positive denite plays key role step deriving results. lorentzian context, one choose euclidean initial value hypersurface try adapt arguments presented obtain information euclidean hypersurface. acknowledgements would like thank s. erdin s. gunturk reading manuscript. 21
