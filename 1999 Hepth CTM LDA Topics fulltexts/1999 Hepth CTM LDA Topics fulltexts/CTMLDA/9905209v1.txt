abstract

we consider the multi-instanton collective coordinate integration measure in n = 2 super-
symmetric su(n) gauge theory with nf fundamental hypermultiplets. in the large-n limit,
at the superconformal point where nf = 2n and all vevs are turned o, the k-instanton
moduli space collapses to a single copy of ads5  s1. the resulting k-instanton eective
measure is proportional to ng4 z (6)
is the partition function of n = (1, 0)
sym theory in six dimensions reduced to zero dimensions. the multi-instanton can in fact
be summed in closed form. as a hint of an ads/cft duality, with the usual relation between
the gauge theory and string theory parameters, this precisely matches the normalization of
the charge-k d-instanton measure in type iib string theory compactied to six dimensions
on k3 with a vanishing two-cycle.

recently, it has been shown that the multi-instanton measure of n = 4 supersymmetric
su(n) yang-mills theory, in the conformal case of vanishing vevs, at large n, has a precise
correspondence with superstring theory on ads5  s5 in the following sense [1, 2]:

(i) the eective large-n collective coordinate space (moduli space) of the charge k

instanton sector is ads5  s5.

(ii) the large-n collective coordinate integration measure for k instantons matches pre-
cisely the measure for d-instantons in the string theory; in particular, it is proportional to
is the partition function for n = (1, 0) supersymmetric yang-mills

(iii) various correlation functions which have instanton contributions match those calcu-
lated from string corrections to the type iib supergravity eective action as required by the
ads/cft correspondence [38].

these features add up to compelling circumstantial evidence in favor of maldacenas conjec-
ture.

it is now tempting to apply the same large-n instanton techniques to theories without
an obvious string theory dual in the hope that the yang-mills instanton calculation will give
some clues about the latter. from a yang-mills perspective a simple variation on the n = 4
theory is n = 2 supersymmetric su(n) gauge theory with nf fundamental hypermultiplets.
as in the n = 4 case, we consider the theory with vanishing vevs. for nf = 2n the theory
then has non-trivial superconformal invariance (just as the n = 4 theory); a priori we expect
that this case might be the most similar to its n = 4 cousin because the coupling does not
run and the instanton calculation can be justied for small values of the t hooft coupling
g2n.

in analogy to the n = 4 model, we shall nd that the multi-instanton series may be

summed in closed form, and the following features emerge:1

k , where z (6)

(i) the eective large-n moduli space of the charge k instanton sector is now ads5  s1.
(ii) the large-n collective coordinate integration measure for k instantons is proportional
to n g4 z (6)
is the partition function for n = (1, 0) sym theory in six dimensions
reduced to zero dimensions. while an ads/cft correspondence is not presently known for
1unlike the n = 4 case [2], here we will not study correlation functions per se since a dictionary relating
gauge-invariant operators on the sym and string sides of a proposed equivalence is missing in the present
case. to leading semiclassical order, n-point correlators h1(x1) n(xn)i are straightforwardly obtained
from the collective coordinate measure obtained below, by inserting 1(x1) n(xn) under the integral,
where each i is replaced by the corresponding classical expression evaluated on the bosonic and/or fermionic
collective coordinates of the multi-instanton.

this n = 2 model, it is suggestive that this expression precisely matches the normalization of
the charge-k d-instanton measure in type iib string theory compactied to six dimensions
on k3 with a vanishing two-cycle [9].

in performing the n = 2 calculation, we shall nd that many of the required formulae
and notation can be adapted in an obvious way from the n = 4 theory, discussed at great
length in [2]. for this reason we shall include only a paucity of details and refer frequently
to this latter reference. in the n = 4 theory the fermion and scalar elds come with su(4)r
indices a, b, . . . = 1, 2, 3, 4. for the present theory, in order to describe the fermions and
scalars of the vector multiplet we only let a, b, . . . = 1, 2. the scalar eld is then the single
complex eld a12 = a21 and the gluinos come in a pair a, a = 1, 2, which rotate into one
another under su(2)r. virtually all the formulae of [2] for these elds in the background of
an instanton may be carried over. the new ingredients are the fundamental matter elds.
these, too, have been discussed at great length, in [10], and we shall borrow profusely from
this reference also.

the charge k instanton solution is described by the following bosonic collective coordi-
nates: the k  k dimensional hermitian matrices a
n, n = 1, 2, 3, 4; the n  k dimensional
matrices w , where  = 1, 2 is a weyl index; and their conjugates w . these are subject
to quadratic adhm constraints reviewed below. the gluino zero modes, a, a = 1, 2, in
the background of the multi-instanton are described by the following grassmann collective
coordinates: the k  k dimensional hermitian matrices ma
 , where  = 1, 2; the n  k di-
mensional matrices a; and their conjugates a. these coordinates are subject to fermionic
adhm constraints which are likewise reviewed below. sometimes it is convenient to assem-
ble separately the bosonic and fermionic collective coordinates into (n + 2k) k dimensional
matrices a = (cid:18) w 

 (cid:19) and ma = (cid:18) a
 (cid:19), where a
ma

  = a

 .

in addition to the collective coordinates coming from the vector multiplet, there are ad-
ditional fermionic (but not bosonic) collective coordinates for the fundamental matter elds
denoted k and k, which are k nf and nf  k dimensional matrices, respectively, of grass-
mann numbers [10]. these collective coordinates account for the 2knf fundamental fermion
zero modes in the k instanton background. unlike the collective coordinates describing the
vector multiplet there are no adhm constraints on k and k.

of vital importance in constructing the instanton measure is the action of the theory
evaluated on the instanton solution, with all the fermion modes turned on.
in the case
when the vevs vanish, the action of the theory evaluated on the multi-instanton solution
has the form [10]

sk

inst =

g2  ik + sk

where the term sk

quad is a particular fermion quadrilinear term of the form

here we have dened the k  k matrix fermion bilinears

vec =

(3a)

(3b)

and l is linear operator on k  k matrices dened in [2, 10]. the existence of a four-fermion
interaction (2) between the fermionic collective coordinates played a vital role in the n = 4
theory and we expect it to do so here as well.

the four-fermion interaction actually lifts all the fermion zero modes except the 8 su-
persymmetric and superconformal adjoint zero modes  a
 and  a which will be explicitly
dened later (or see [2]). from the form of the quadrilinear action (2), we see that adjoint
zero modes, numbering 4kn, and fundamental zero modes, numbering 2knf , are lifted in
equal number. in any given n-point function, the n insertions must, of course, saturate the
integrals over the 8 exact supersymmetric and superconformal adjoint zero modes but fur-
thermore let us suppose that they saturate the integrals over na  8 extra adjoint fermion
zero modes and nf fundamental fermion zero modes. we then have the following selection
rule:

from this selection rule it immediately follows that:

na  nf = 2k(2n  nf ) .

(4)

(i) unless one requires nf  2n in the large-n limit, the only non-vanishing correlators
in this limit are ones where the number of insertions grows with n. in this case the insertions
will necessarily modify the large-n saddle-point equations derived below (see for example the
analysis of ref. [11]).

(ii) it is obvious from eq. (4) that it is only in the conformal case nf = 2n that a
given correlation function gets a contribution from each instanton number k rather than
from only one value of k. moreover, in the absence of vevs, only in the conformal case can
one choose an arbitrarily small coupling constant and hence rigorously justify the instanton
approximation (again, see ref. [11] for an analysis of what goes wrong with instanton physics
when the vevs are zero but the -function is not).

for these reasons, we concentrate henceforth on the conformal case nf = 2n.

the next ingredient needed in the analysis is the integration measure dk

vec on the space of
collective coordinates of the vector multiplet. this has been determined in refs. [2,10,12,13].

4

it is simply the at cartesian measure for the bosonic and fermionic collective coordinates
with explicit delta functions that impose the aforementioned bosonic and fermionic adhm
constraints:2

the full measure is given by

(5)

(6)

where dk
this is simply

hyp is the measure for the fermionic collective coordinates from the matter elds;

z dk

hyp = 2knf z dknfk dknf k ,

(7)

where the integrals dknfk and dknf k are dened as separate integrals over each component
of the matrices k and k [10]. in (6) the constant c 
1 is determined by a detailed comparison of
this measure with the one instanton measure of bernard for su(n) [14] suitably generalized
to an n = 2 theory with fundamental hypermultiplets. this comparison gives

c 

1 = 21/22n 2n nf ,

(8)

where  is the dynamical mass scale in the pauli-villars regularization scheme.

following the same strategy as in [2,10], we can bilinearize the four fermion interaction by
introducing a set of auxiliary variables a, a = 1, 2, a two-vector of hermitian k  k matrices.
in addition, it is convenient to dene the matrix of complex variables

 = 1 + i2 .

(9)

the transformation we need was established in [10] and later adapted to the n = 4 theory
in [2]:

(detk2 l)1 exp sk
= k2 z d2k2

quad

 exp(cid:2)  trk ala + 8g1trk hyp + 8g1trk vec(cid:3).

(10)

conveniently, the factor of (detk2 l)1 needed in this gaussian rewriting is supplied by the at
measure, (5). next we transform to the so-called gauge invariant measure [2]; this change of

2the integrals over k  k matrix quantities a

n and ma

dened with respect to a basis of hermitian matrices t r, r = 1, . . . , k2, normalized so that trk t rt s = rs.

 and the arguments of the delta functions are

variables has the enormous calculational advantage that it allows us to integrate out explicitly
both the bosonic and fermionic adhm constraints. the necessary manipulations are detailed
in [2]. the resulting measure involves the bilinear bosonic variables

w 

 = w  w  , w 0 = tr2 w, w c = tr2  cw, c = 1, 2, 3 ,

(11)

where w 0 and w c are k  k hermitian matrices, and a decomposition of the fermionic
collective coordinates {a, a}:

a = w  a + a,

a =  a

 w  + a ,

where {a, a} lie in the orthogonal subspace to w in the sense that

w a = 0 ,

aw  = 0 .

(12)

(13)

here  a and  a
 are k  k matrices of grassmann spinors. the bosonic coordinates w c, c =
1, 2, 3 and the fermionic coordinates  a
 are then explicitly integrated-out using, respectively,
the delta-functions in (5) whose arguments are the bosonic and fermionic adhm constraints.

as in the n = 4 model discussed in ref. [2], the next stage involves explicitly integrating
out the as and as. concentrating on the nal term in the exponent in eq. (10), one
expands:

vec =

1
8

(12  21) + vec .

(14)

here we have dened a k  k matrix fermion bilinear in the remainingunintegrated
fermionic collective coordinates:

vec =

w 


2   2

w

(15)

where  a
performing the integration over the as and as then gives:

 , in turn, is dened in terms of  a and ma

 using the fermionic adhm constraints.

g(cid:17)2k(n 2k)

(cid:0)detk(cid:1)2(n 2k) .

(16)

this term will contribute to the saddle-point at large n.

next we turn to the fermionic collective coordinates in the matter sector. focusing on
the middle term in the exponent in eq. (10) and integrating out the k and k modes gives
(for general nf ):

z dknfk dknf k exp(cid:2) 1

2g1trk k k(cid:3) = (cid:16) 

2g(cid:17)knf

(cid:0)detk(cid:1)nf .

(17)

putting together all the previous steps, we now have a form for the measure which is amenable
to a large-n limit:

here the constant ck,n comes from switching to gauge-invariant variables, and is given by [2]:

ck,n =

22kn 4k2+k2kn 2k2+k

q2k
i=1(n  i)!

.

as in [2], in order to facilitate taking the large-n limit, it is useful to re-scale :

n  .

 

(19)

(20)

with this rescaling, the last term in the exponent of eq. (18) now scales like n, hence
contributes to the large-n saddle-point equations (as do the three determinantal factors
preceding the exponential). collecting all the bosonic terms which have the form of an
exponent of n times something and specializing once again to nf = 2n denes the
large-n eective instanton action:

se =  log det2kw  2 log detk  2 log detk + trk ala .

(21)

we now turn to the solution of the large-n saddle-point equations. these are the coupled
euler-lagrange equations that come from extremizing se with respect to the remaining
bosonic collective coordinates in the problem. the analysis of these coupled equations, while
rather involved, is virtually identical to the n = 4 model of ref. [2]; hence we suppress the
calculational details. as in that model, the saddle-point solution that is dominant in the
large-n limit is given by:

w 0 = 22 1[k][k] ,

a = 1 a 1[k][k] ,

a
n = xn 1[k][k] ,

where a is a unit 2-vector. it is convenient to parametrize a by the phase angle :

1 + i 2 = ei .

(22)

(23)

the interpretation of the solution is as in [2] with the s5 replaced by s1, parametrized
by a.
in other words, the solution is parametrized by a point (xn, , ) on ads5  s1.
as in the n = 4 case, the solution (22) is not actually the most general solution to the
saddle-point equations; there are additional at directions (moduli). however, we shall nd

7

in a completely analogous way that the integrals over the additional moduli are actually
convergent; as such, they are more conveniently viewed as uctuations around, rather than
facets of, the maximally symmetric saddle-point solution (22).

the next stage of the analysis is to expand the eective action in the uctuations out to
sucient order to ensure the convergence of the integrals over the uctuations. fortunately,
the analysis need not be repeated because our eective action (21) is, up to a constant, simply

the n = 4 eective action of [2] with the replacements 12  /8, 34  /8 and all

other components of ab set to zero. the uctuations in w 0 are integrated out at gaussian
order to leave integrals over the remaining uctuations in a
n and a, the traceless parts, that
are lifted at quartic order; the terms beyond quartic order are then formally suppressed by
(fractional) powers of 1/n, and may be dropped. the action for these quartic uctuations
is precisely the action for six-dimensional yang-mills theory with gauge eld

a = n 1/4(cid:0)1a

n,  a(cid:1) ,  = 1, . . . , 6 ,
2 trk [a, a]2 +    .

(24)

dimensionally reduced to 0 dimensions, i.e. with all derivatives set to zero:

(25)
in (24) the hats on the variables imply that they are traceless kk matrices, i.e. su(k)-valued
rather than u(k).

s(a) = nse =  1

not surprisingly the coupling to the fermions completes the six-dimensional theory to
an n = (1, 0) supersymmetric gauge theory in six dimensions dimensionally reduced to 0
dimensions. it is easy to see, for instance, that this theory has the requisite number of super-
symmetries. the eight dimensional fermion eld of the n = (1, 0) theory has components
(26)

2g

n 1/8ei/2(cid:0)1/2 ma

 , 1/2  a(cid:1) ,

in terms of which the coupling to the vector completes the action (25) to

s(a, ) =  1

2trk [a, a]2 + trk  [a, ] .

in (26) we have used the decomposition of the fermionic collective coordinates

 a = 4 a1[k][k] +  a ,

finally our eective measure for the k instantons has the form

(31)

this has a remarkable similarity to the form of the n = 4 measure (see eq. (5.45) in [2]).
apart from the dierences in the overall numerical factors, the integral over s5 is replaced
by s1 and the n = 4 measure involves, in addition, the factor pd|k d2, the sum over the
integer divisors of k. notice that the n dependence and factor of k7/2 is the same in both
cases. we can sum the instanton series in this case in terms of a generalized zeta-function:4



xk=1

k7/2e2ik = e2i (e2i , 7

2 , 1) .

(33)

the appearance of the phase in (32) implies a selection rule in order that correlation
functions are non-vanishing. in fact this is exactly the selection rule (4) since, as is clear
from the couplings of the fermion bilinears to  in (10), each insertion of an adjoint fermion
mode, other than the 8 exact modes, (numbering na  8) implies an insertion of ei/2 and
each insertion of a fundamental fermion mode (numbering nf ) implies an insertion of ei/2.
using this selection rule we see that the simplest kind of non-vanishing correlation functions
would involve operators that saturate the 8 supersymmetric and superconformal zero modes
and also 8 fundamental fermion modes, i.e. na = 8 and nf = 8.

in the n = 4 theory the large-n instanton measure could be interpreted directly as
the d-instanton measure for type iib string theory on ads5  s5. the natural question
3we have written the result in a way which allows an easy comparison with [15]. the factors of 2 and
2 arise, respectively, from the dierence in the denition of the bosonic integrals and the normalization of
the generators: we have trk t rt s = rs rather than 1
2 rs. the remaining factors are the result of [15]. we

have also used vol u (k) = 2kk(k+1)/2/qk1

4we thank michael nieto for pointing this out [16].

i=1 i!.

to ask is whether there is any similar interpretation for the measure (32) in terms of d-
instantons in six dimensions. remarkably there is such a relation arising from the type iib
superstring compactied on k3 [9]. d-instantons arise from wrapping the world-volume of
the d-string in ten dimensions on an s2 in k3 at a special point in the latter where the s2
vanishes. more generally, green and gutperle [9] were able to deduce the normalization of
the measure for d-instantons in various dimensions (4, 6 and 10) from the exact expressions
for certain higher-derivative terms in the supergravity eective actions in those dimensions.
for arbitrary dimension d, the leading order piece in the weak coupling expansion has the
generic form:

()1(sk)ade2(skik) z (d)

k (cid:0)1 + o(s1

k )(cid:1) ,

(34)

where sk = ke is the k-instanton action, where  is the expectation value of the dilaton, the
ns-ns scalar, and  is the expectation value of the r-r scalar. in the above ad is a constant
that depends upon the dimension and z (d)
is the partition function of su(k) minimally
supersymmetric gauge theory in d-dimensions dimensionally reduced to zero dimensions, as
in (30), but with a dierent normalization:

k

z (10)
k = xd|k

d2 ,

z (6)
k = z (4)

k = k2 .

hence in six dimensions, where a6 =  3

2, the leader order behaviour is

()1e3/2k7/2 exp(2ik(ie + )) .

(35)

(36)

with the usual identication of coupling constants of the yang-mills theory at large n and

the string theory parameters; namely g = 4e,  = 2 and ()1  pg2n , (36) goes

like

ng4k7/2e2ik ,

(37)

which matches the normalization of (32) exactly.

it remains to be seen whether the relation of the d-instanton measure of the type iib
string compactied on the special k3 and the large n multi-instanton measure in n = 2
su(n) gauge theory with 2n fundamental hypermultiplets is a reection of an ads/cft-
type duality. however, we should make the following cautionary remark. it is believed that
for a conformal gauge theory to admit a sugra dual in the large n limit the two coecients
of the four-dimensional anomaly, denoted as a and c in [17], have to be equal at leading order
in 1/n [18, 19]. for the n = 2 conformal theory that we are considering this is not the case
since a = 1
6(2n 2  1) [20].5 this implies that the dual, if it exists, is a
string theory which does not have a sugra approximation.

24 (7n 2  5) and c = 1

5this was pointed out to us by michael gutperle [21], who recently considered d-instantons and an
ads/cft correspondence in an n = 2 conformal theory involving the gauge group sp(n ); however, in this
case a = c and a sugra dual exists.
