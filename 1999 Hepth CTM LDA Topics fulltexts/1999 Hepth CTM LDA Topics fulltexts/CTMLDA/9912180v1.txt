abstract

we construct the integrable model corresponding to the n = 2 supersymmetric su(n)
gauge theory with matter in the antisymmetric representation, using the spectral curve found
by landsteiner and lopez through m theory. the model turns out to be the hamiltonian
reduction of a n + 2 periodic spin chain model, which is hamiltonian with respect to the
universal symplectic form we had constructed earlier for general soliton equations in the lax
or zakharov-shabat representation.

1 introduction

the main goal of this paper is to construct the integrable model which corresponds to
the n = 2 susy su(n) yang-mills theory with a hypermultiplet in the antisymmetric
representation. the 1994 work of seiberg and witten [1] had shown that the wilson eective
action of n = 2 susy yang-mills theory is determined by a bration of spectral curves 
equipped with a meromorphic one-form d, now known as the seiberg-witten dierential.
it was soon recognized afterwards [2, 3, 4] that this set-up is indicative of an underlying
integrable model, with the vacuum moduli of the yang-mills theory corresponding to the
action variables of the integrable model. in fact, in the special case of hyperelliptic curves, a
similar set-up for the construction of action variables as periods of a meromorphic dierential
had been introduced in [5]. this unexpected relation between n = 2 yang-mills theories on
one hand and integrable models has proven to be very benecial for both sides. the seiberg-
witten dierential has led to a universal symplectic form for soliton equations in the lax or
zakharov-shabat representation [6, 7]. the connection with integrable models has helped
solve the su(n) yang-mills theory with a hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation [4, 8],
as well as pure yang-mills theories with arbitrary simple gauge groups g [3]. conversely, the
connection with yang-mills theories has led to new integrable models, such as the twisted
calogero-moser systems associated with yang-mills theories with non-simply laced gauge
group and matter in the adjoint representation [9], and the elliptic analog of the toda lattice
[10]. 1

despite all these successes, we still do not know at this moment how to identify or
construct the correct integrable model corresponding to a given yang-mills theory. this is a
serious drawback, since the integrable model can be instrumental in investigating key physical
issues such as duality, the renormalization group, or instanton corrections [13, 14, 15]. at the
same time, the list of spectral curves continues to grow, thanks in particular to methods from
m theory [16, 17] and geometric engineering [18]. it seems urgent to develop methods which
can identify the correct integrable model from a given spectral curve and seiberg-witten
dierential.

in the case of interest in this paper, namely the su(n) gauge theory with antisymmetric
matter, the seiberg-witten dierential and spectral curve had been found by landsteiner
and lopez [17] using branes and m theory. the seiberg-witten dierential d is given by

d = x

where  is a renormalization scale. for the su(n) gauge theories, one restricts to un = 1,
un 1 = 0, so that the moduli dimension is n 1, which is the rank of the gauge group su(n).

the landsteiner-lopez curve (1.2) and dierential (1.1) have been studied extensively by
ennes, naculich, rhedin, and schnitzer [20]. in particular, they have veried that the curve
and dierential do reproduce the correct perturbative behavior of the prepotential predicted
by asymptotic freedom. the problem which we wish to address here is the one of nding
a dynamical system which is integrable in the sense that it admits a lax pair, and which
corresponds to the landsteiner-lopez curve and seiberg-witten dierential (1.1) in the sense
that its spectral curve is of the form (1.2), and its action variables are the periods of d along
n  1 suitable cycles on .

we have succeeded in constructing two integrable spin chain models, whose spectral
curves are given exactly by the landsteiner-lopez curves. however, the action variables of
the desired integrable model must be given by d = x dy
y , and here the two models dier
signicantly. for one model, referred to as the odd divisor spin model, the 2-form resulting
from d vanishes identically. for the other, referred to as the even divisor spin model,
the hamiltonian reduction of the 2-form resulting from d to the moduli space of vacua
{un = 1,
un 1 = 0} is non-degenerate, and the reduced system is indeed hamiltonian
with respect to this symplectic form, with hamiltonian h = un 2. thus the latter model is
the integrable system we are looking for.

our main result is as follows2. let qn, pn be 3-dimensional vectors which are n + 2

main theorem.  the dynamical system (1.6) is equivalent to the lax equation

l(x) = [m(x), l(x)];

(1.10)

 the spectral curves  = {r(x, y)  det(yi  l(x)) = 0} are invariant under the ow (1.6),
and are exactly the curves of the landsteiner-lopez form (1.2) (with n +2 normalized to 1);
 there is a natural map (qn, pn)  (, d) from the space of all spin chains satisfying the
constraints (1.3,1.4) to the space of pairs (, d), where  is a landsteiner-lopez curve, and
d = {z1,    , z2n +1} is a divisor whose class [d] = [d] is symmetric under the involution

 :

(x, y) = z  z = (x, y1).

(1.11)

for a given (qn, pn), d is the set of poles of the bloch function 0, l(x)0 = y0(x);
 let m0 be the space of pairs {, [d]}, where  is a landsteiner-lopez curve with un = 1,
un 1 = 0, and [d] is a divisor class which is symmetric under the involution . then the
space m0 has dimension 2(n  1). the map (qn, pn)  (, d) descends to a map between
the two spaces

{(qn, pn)}/g  m0,

(1.12)

where on the left hand side, we have factored out the gauge group g from the space of periodic
spin chains satisfying the constraints (1.3,1.4). at a generic curve  and a divisor [d] in
general position, the map (1.12) is a local isomorphism.
 let the action variables ai and the angle variables i be dened on the space m0 by

ai = iai

d,

i =

 the dynamical system (1.6) is hamiltonian with respect the symplectic form (1.14). the

in terms of the (qn, pn) dynamical variables, the hamiltonian can be expressed under the

we would like to note the similarity of the lax matrix l in (1.9) to the 2  2 lax matrix
used in [21] for the integration of a quasi-classical approximation to a system of reggeons in
qcd.

a key tool in our analysis is the construction of [6, 7], which shows that symplectic
forms constructed in terms of seiberg-witten dierentials can also be constructed directly in
terms of the lax representation of integrable models. the latter are given by the following
universal formula [6, 7]

 =

1

2 x

resp < 

n+1ln(x)  n > dx

(1.16)

where n and 
n+1 are the bloch and dual bloch functions of the system, and p are marked
punctures on the spectral curve . in the present case, p are the 3 points on  above x = .

finally, we note that the odd divisor spin model (which we describe in 3.1 and 6) may be
of independent interest. although the symplectic form associated to the seiberg-dierential
x dy
is degenerate in this case, the model does admits a hamiltonian structure with non-
y
degenerate symplectic form, but one which is associated rather with the form d(1) = ln y dx
x .
as suggested in [19], the form ln y dx
x is also indicative of supersymmetric yang-mills theories,
but in 5 or 6 dimensions with n = 1 supersymmetry.

2 geometry of the landsteiner-lopez curve

we begin by identifying the geometric features of the generic landsteiner-lopez curve which
will play an important role in the sequel. fixing the normalization n +2 = 1, we can write

 : r(x, y)  y3  f (x)y2 + f (x)y  1 = 0

where f (x) is a polynomial of the form

f (x) = 3 + x2pn (x), pn (x) =

uixi

n

xi=0

(2.1)

(2.2)

the parameters u0,    , un are the moduli of the landsteiner-lopez curve.

 the landsteiner-lopez curve  is a three-fold covering of the complex plane in the x
variable. it is invariant under the involution  dened in (1.11). the important points on 
are the singular points, the points above x = , and the branch points. we discuss now all
these points in turn.

 the singular points are the points where

xr(x, y) = yr(x, y) = 0

(2.3)

the generic landsteiner-lopez curve has exactly one singular point, namely (x, y) = (0, 1).
at this point, the equation (2.1) has a triple root, and all three sheets of the curve intersect.
for generic values of the moduli ui, all three solutions y of r(x, y) = 0 can be expressed as
power series in x in a neighborhood of x = 0

y(x) = 1 +

yixi



xi=1

5

(2.4)

in fact, we can substitute (2.4) into (2.1) to nd recursively all coecients yi, with the rst
coecient y1 a solution of

y3
1  u0y1 + 2u1 = 0.

(2.5)

for generic u0, u1, this equation does admit three distinct solutions for y1, which lead in turn
to the three distinct solutions. these three distinct solutions provide eectively a smooth
resolution of the curve , where the crossing point y = 1 above x = 0 has been separated
into 3 distinct points q, 1    3. under the involution , the leading terms in the three
solutions (2.4) transform as

(x, 1 + y1x +   )  (x, (1  y1x +   )1) = (x, 1 + y1x +   )

(2.6)

since the three solutions y1 of the equation (2.5) are distinct for generic values of the moduli
ui, we see that each of the three points q above x = 0 are xed under the involution .

 for generic values of the moduli ui, there are also three distinct branches of y(x) near

x = . a rst branch y(x) = o(xn +2) with a pole of order n + 2 can be readily found

y(x) = xn +2(un + un 1x1 + un 2x2 +   ).

(2.7)

(the rst three coecients in y(x) turn out to be exactly the rst three coecients un , un 1
and un 2 in the polynomial pn (x) of (2.2).) we denote by p1 the corresponding point above
x = . in view of the involution , a second branch y(x) = o(x(n +2)) with a zero of order
n + 2 exists which is the image of the rst branch under 

y(x) = (x)(n +2) 1

un  1 +

un 1
un

x1 +

u2
n 1  un un 2

u2
n

x2 +   !

(2.8)

the corresponding point above x =  is denoted p3. finally, the involution  implies that
the third branch y(x) is regular and xed under 

y(x) = ()n +2[1 + o(cid:18) 1
x(cid:19) ]

denoting the corresponding point above x =  by p2, we have

 : p1  p3,

 : p2  p2.

(2.9)

(2.10)

 the branching points of  over x-plane are just the zeroes on  of the function yr(x, y)
which are dierent from the singular points q. this function has a pole of order 2(n + 2)
at p1 and a pole of order (n + 2) at each of the points p2 and p3. therefore, it has 4n + 8
zeros. at each of the points q the function yr(x, y) has zeros of order 2. hence

#{branch points} = 4n + 2.

(2.11)

note that for generic moduli ui, neither 0 nor  is a branch point, in view of our previous
discussion. also for generic ui, we can assume that the ramication index at all branch points
is 2. thus the total branching number is just the number of branch points. since the number

6

of sheets is 3, the riemann-hurwitz formula can be written as g() = 3 + 1
in this case. thus the genus g() of the curve  is

2(4n + 2) + 1

g() = 2n  1.

(2.12)

 for generic moduli ui, the involution  :    has exactly four xed points, namely
the three points q above x = 0 and the point p2 above x = . that implies that the
factor-curve / has genus

g(/) = n  1.

(2.13)

the involution  induces an involution of the jacobian variety j() of . the odd part
j p r() of j() is the prym variety and the even part is isogenic to the jacobian j(/) of
the factor-curve /. the dimension of the space of divisors [d] which are even under  is
equal to dim j(/) = n  1.

3 the spin models

we introduce two systems with the same family of spectral curves (2.1). one system has
non-trivial dynamics along the even while the other system has non-trivial dynamics along
the odd (prym) directions of the jacobian. the system corresponding to the su(n) yang-
mills theory with a hypermultiplet in the anti-symmetric representation is the even system.
we sketch here the outline of the construction of both models, leaving the full discussion to
sections 4-5.

both models are periodic spin chain models, with a 3-dimensional complex vector at
each site. we view three-dimensional vectors s as column vectors, with components s,
1    3. we denote by st the transpose of s, which is then a three-dimensional row
vector, with components s. in particular, st s is a scalar, while sst is a 3  3 matrix. since
the odd divisor spin model is simpler, we begin with it.

3.1 the odd divisor spin model

the odd divisor spin model is a (n + 2)-periodic chain of complex three-dimensional vectors
sn = sn +n+2, sn = (sn,),  = 1, 2, 3, subject to the constraint

st
n sn =

3

x=1

and the following equations of motion

sn =

.

(3.1)

(3.2)

the constraint (3.1) and the equations of motion are invariant under transformation of the
spin chain by a matrix v satisfying the condition v t v = i

sn  v sn

7

(3.3)

the odd divisor spin model is integrable in the sense that the equations of motion are
equivalent to a lax pair. to see this, we dene the 3  3 matrices ln(x) and mn(x) by

ln(x) = 1 + x snst
n

mn(x) = x

1

st
n sn1

(sn1st

n + snst

n1)

then the compatibility condition for the system of equations

n+1 = ln(x)n
n = mn(x)n

is given by

ln(x) = mn+1(x)ln(x)  ln(x)mn(x)

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

a direct calculation shows that for ln(x) and mn(x) dened as in (3.5), this equation is
equivalent to the equations of motion (3.2) for the spin model. dene now the monodromy
matrix l(x) by

n +1

l(x) = ln +1(x)    l0(x) =

ln(x)

(3.9)

yn=0

where the ordering in the product on the right hand side starts by convention with the lowest
indices on the right. then l(x) and m(x) = m0(x) form themselves a lax pair

this is easily veried using (3.8), since

l(x) = [m(x), l(x)]

l(x) =

(3.13)

(3.14)

in particular, the characteristic equation of l(x) is time-independent and denes a time-
independent spectral curve

 = {(x, y); 0 = r(x, y)  det (yi  l(x))}.

(3.15)

we assert that these spectral curves are landsteiner-lopez curves (2.1). in fact, it follows
immediately from the expression (3.5) that det ln(x) = 1, ln(x) = ln(x)t , and ln(x)1 =
l(x). thus

det l(x) = 1, l(x)1 = l(x).

(3.16)

8

these two equations imply that det(yi l(x)) is of the form (2.1) for some polynomial f (x).
to obtain the expression (2.2) for f (x), it suces to observe that

f (x) = tr l(x) = tr (1 + x

(3.17)

dene the moduli ui of the curve r(x, y) = 0 as in (2.1) by f (x) = 3 + x2pn

the correspondence between the dynamical variables sn, 0  n  n + 1, and the moduli ui
is given by

(3.18)

where the summation runs over the set ii of all ordered i-th multi-indices n1 < n2 <    < ni.

to obtain the phase space of the model, we consider the space of all (n + 2)-periodic
spin chains sn, subject to the constraint (3.1), and modulo the equivalence sn  v sn, where
v is a matrix satisfying v t v = i. the dimension of this space is

dim {sn}/{sn  v sn} = 2n + 1.

(3.19)

indeed, the (n + 2)-periodic spin chains sn have 3(n + 2) degrees of freedom. the constraint
(3.1) removes n + 2 degrees of freedom, and the equivalence sn  v sn removes 3 others,
since the dimension of the matrices v with v t v is 3. a 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold
lodd is obtained by setting

lodd = {sn; un = constant }/{sn  v sn}

(3.20)

on the space lodd, the system is hamiltonian with respect to the symplectic form dened
by the dierential d(1) = (ln x) dy

(3.21)

the action-variables are the periods of the dierential d(1) = (ln x) dy
y over a basis of n
cycles for the curve , which are odd under the involution . if the curve  is viewed as a
twosheeted cover of /, these n odd curves can be realized as the n cuts along which the
sheets are to be glued.

3.2 the even divisor spin model

the even divisor spin model is the hamiltonian reduction of a periodic spin chain model
which incorporates a natural gauge invariance.

the starting point is a (n + 2)-periodic chain of pairs of three-dimensional complex
vectors pn = (pn,), qn = (qn,), 1    3, satisfying the constraints (1.3). we impose the
equations of motion (1.6). as noted before, the constraints and the equations of motion are

9

invariant under the gauge transformations (1.7,1.8). in particular, a gauge xed version of
the equations of motion (1.6) is

pn =

pn+1
pt
n+1qn

+

pn1
pt
n1qn

,

qn = 

qn+1
pt

qn1

.

this version follows from the other one by the gauge transformation

pn  n(t)pn, qn  1

n (t)qn, (t) = exp(cid:18)z t

n(t)dt(cid:19) .

we shall see in the next section that the system (1.6) admits a lax representation.

(3.22)

(3.23)

a reduced system is dened as follows. we impose the additional constraints (1.4). with
these constraints, the spectral curves of the system are the landsteiner-lopez curves (2.1).
the dimension of the phase space m of all (qn, pn) subjected to the previous constraints and
divided by the gauge group g of (1.7,1.8), is

dim m  dim {(qn, pn)}/g = 2n.

(3.24)

to see this, assume that n is even (the counting for n odd is similar). then the constraint
(1.4) reduces the number of degrees of the (n + 2)-periodic spin chain (qn, pn) to the number
3(n + 2) of a (n + 2)-periodic spin chain. the constraint (1.3) and the gauge transformation
(1.7) each eliminates n
2 + 1 degrees of freedom. now the dimension of the space of matrices
w satisfying w g0 = g0w is 5. however, in the gauge transformation (1.8), the matrices
w which are diagonal have already been accounted for in the gauge transformation (1.7).
altogether, we arrive at the count which we announced earlier.

the phase space {(qn, pn)}/g itself can be reduced further, to a lower-dimensional phase
space dened by suitable constraints on the moduli space (u0,    , un ). it turns out that
there are 2 possible natural further reductions, each related to its own choice of dierential
d and corresponding hamiltonian structure:

 on the (2n  2)-dimensional phase space dened by the constraints

m0 = {(qn, pn); un = 1, un 1 = 0}/g

(3.25)

the system is hamiltonian with respect to the symplectic form dened by the dierential
d = x dy
y . here we have used the same notation for the space just introduced and the
space m0 described in the main theorem, in anticipation of their isomorphism which will
be established later in 4. the hamiltonian is given by h = un 2 or equivalently by (1.15).
the action-variables are periods of d along a basis of n  1 cycles ai of  which are
even under the involution . (equivalently, the ai correspond to a basis of cycles for the
factor curve /.) this is the desired integrable hamiltonian system, corresponding to
the n = 2 supersymmetric su(n) yang-mills theory with a hypermultiplet in the anti-
symmetric representation.

 on the (2n  2)-dimensional phase space m2 dened by the constraints

m2 = {(qn, pn); u0 = constant, u1 = constant}/g

4 the direct and inverse spectral transforms

we concentrate now on the even divisor spin model. the main goal of this section is to
describe the map stated in the main theorem, which associates to the spin chain (qn, pn) a
geometric data (, [d])

(qn, pn)  (, [d]),

(4.1)

the curve  is obtained by showing that the dynamical system (1.6) for (pn, qn) admits a lax
representation l(x) = [m(x), l(x)], in which case  is the spectral curve {det (yi  l(x)) =
0}. the lax operator l(x) also gives rise to the bloch function, which is essentially its
eigenvector. the divisor d is obtained by taking the divisor of poles of the bloch function.
a characteristic feature of the even divisor spin model is that the equivalence class of this
divisor [d] is even under the involution . the map (4.1) descends to a map from the space
of equivalence classes of (qn, pn) under the gauge group g to the space of geometric data
(, [d]). these two spaces are of the same dimension 2n: we saw this in (3.24) for the
rst space, while for the second, the number 2n of parameters is due to n + 1 parameters
for the landsteiner-lopez curves (including un and un 1), and n  1 parameters for the
even divisors [d]. it is a fundamental fact in the theory that the map (4.1) becomes then a
bijective correspondence of generic points

{qn, pn)}/g  {(, [d])}

(4.2)

we shall refer to the construction  described above as the direct problem. the reverse
construction , which recaptures the dynamical variables (pn, qn) from the geometric data
(, [d]) will be referred to as the inverse problem. as usual in the geometric theory of solitons
[22], it will be based on the construction of a baker-akhiezer function. we now provide the
details.

4.1 the lax representation

we exhibit rst the lax representation for the system (1.6). the desired formulas can be
obtained from a slight modication of the easier odd spin model treated in 3.1. let pn, qn

11

be (n + 2)-periodic, three-dimensional vectors satisfying pt
functions ln(x) and mn(x) by

n qn = 0, and dene matrix-valued

ln(x) = 1 + x qnpt

n , mn(x) = x  qn1pt

n
pt
n qn1



n1

qnpt
pt

n1qn! .

(4.3)

then a direct calculation shows that the matrix functions ln(x) and mn(x) satisfy the lax
equation

tln = mn+1ln  lnmn

(4.4)

if and only if the vectors pn and qn satisfy the equations of motion (1.6).

as before, the equation (4.4) is a compatibility condition for the linear system n+1 =
n = mn(x)n. to obtain the spectral curve , we observe that the same arguments
ln(x)n,
as in the case of the odd spin model show that the matrix m(x) = m0(x) and the monodromy

matrix l(x) dened by l(x) = qn +1

n=0 ln(x) form again a lax pair

l(x) = [m(x), l(x)],

(4.5)

thus the spectral curve  = {(x, y); r(x, y)  det(yi  l(x)) = 0} is time-independent and
well-dened. we have used here the same notation r(x, y) as for (2.1), since the equation
det (yi l(x)) is indeed of the landsteiner-lopez form. to see this, we note that det ln(x) =
1 and ln(x) = ln(x)1. together with the constraint (1.4), this implies

det l(x) = 1, l(x) = g0l1(x)g0.

but we also have near x = 0

tr l(x) = tr (1 + x

n

xn=0

qnpt

n ) + o(x2) = 3 + 0(x2),

so that det(yi  l(x)) is of the form (2.1).

(4.6)

(4.7)

we observe that the expression r(x, y) = det (yi  l(x)) is invariant with respect to
the gauge transformations (1.7) and (1.8). therefore, if we write r(x, y) in the landsteiner-
lopez form (2.1) with moduli ui, the moduli ui are well-dened functions on the factor-space
m. in analogy with the odd spin case, ui can be written in terms of the dynamical variables
(pn, qn) as

(p+

uk = xik

i1qi2)(p+

i2qi3)    (p+

ik qi1)

(4.8)

here the summation is again over sets ik of multi-indices i = (i1 < i2 < . . . < ik).

4.2 general properties of bloch functions

the points q = (x, y) of the spectral curve  = {(x, y); det(yi  l(x)) = 0} parametrize the
bloch functions {n(q)}0nn +1 of the spin model. we begin by recalling the denition of
bloch functions, and by describing their main properties in the case of our model.

12

 we x a generic choice of moduli parameters ui. then the matrix l(x) has 3 distinct
eigenvalues y, except possibly at a nite number of points x. let q = (x, y). the bloch
solution n(q) for the spin model {ln(x)}0nn +1 is the function n(q) with the following
properties

n+1(q) = ln(x)n(q), n +n+2(q) = yn(q).

(4.9)

these equations determine n(q) only up to a multiplicative constant. to normalize n(q),
we observe that for generic moduli parameters ui, there are only nitely many points q where
0 (q) = 0.

=1 
outside of these points, we can x n(q) by the following normalization condition

the eigenvector 0(q) of the matrix l(x) satises the linear constraint p3



0 = 1.

3

x=1

(4.10)

the bloch function n(q) is then determined on the spectral curve  outside of a nite
number of points, and hence uniquely on . furthermore, the components of n(q) are
meromorphic functions on . this follows from the constraint (4.10) and the equation
l(x)0(q) = y0(q). they imply that 0(q) is a rational expression in y and in the entries
of the matrix (l(x)  l3(x)) 13
, in view of cramers rule for solving inhomogeneous
systems of linear equations. since x, y and l(x) are all meromorphic functions on , our
assertion follows.

12

 the exceptional points excluded in the preceding construction of bloch functions are
the points where l(x) has multiple eigenvalues, and the points where the eigenvector 0(q)
0 (q) = 0. by restricting ourselves to generic
values of the moduli ui, we can make the convenient assumption that these two sets of points
0 (q) = 0, the function

lies in the linear subspace of equation p3
are disjoint. in this case, it is evident that at points where p3

0(q) develops a pole.

=1 

=1 

consider now a point x0 6= 0 where the matrix l(x) has a multiple eigenvalue. let
(x  x0)1/b be the local holomorphic coordinate centered at the points q lying above x0,
where the branching index b can be either 1 or 2. (we can exclude the possibility b = 3 by a
genericity assumption on the moduli ui.) the holomorphic function y on the surface  can
be expanded as

where b = 1 is a root of unity. if b = 1, it follows that

y = y0 + y1(x  x0)1/b + o(x  x0),

xr(x0, y0) = yr(x0, y0) = 0,

(4.11)

(4.12)

which means that the curve is singular at (x0, y0). by a genericity assumption on the moduli
ui, the only singular point on  is at x0 = 0, and this possibility has been excluded. thus
b = 2, and the curve  has a branch point at x0 if and only if l(x0) has multiple eigenvalues.
the matrix l(x0) can now be shown to be a jordan cell, i.e., l(x0) is of the form

l(x0) = 


1 
0 2
0

0
0
0 3




13

(4.13)

in a suitable basis, for some  6= 0 and 1 = 2 6= 3. in fact, l(x0) has only one double
eigenvalue by genericity assumptions on ui. the three branches of the function y consist
then of one branch which is of the form 3 + y1(x  x0) +    and is holomorphic in the
variable x  x0. the other two branches are of the form

y = 1  y1(x  x0)1/2 +    .

(4.14)

we must have y1 6= 0, for otherwise y = o(x  x0), and the same argument which ruled out
the branching index b = 1 would imply that  is singular at x0. now for x near but distinct
from x0, the bloch function 0(q) also has 3 distinct branches. let  be the branches
corresponding to the eigenvalues in (4.14), and expand them as

 = (0)

 + (x  x0)1/2(1)

 + o(x  x0)

up to o(x  x0), the eigenvector condition can be expressed as

l(x)((0)

 + (x  x0)1/2(1)

 ) = (1  y1(x  x0)1/2)((0)

 + (x  x0)1/2(1)
 )

this is equivalent to

l(x0)(0)

 = 1(0)
 ,

(l(x0)  1)(1)

 = y1(0)
 .

(4.15)

(4.16)

(4.17)

clearly, this equation admits no solution if l(x0) is diagonal. thus l(x0) is of the form (4.13)
with  6= 0. we can now identify the coecients (0)
 in the puiseux expansion
(4.15). the eigenspace of l(x0) corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 is one-dimensional and
generated by a single vector 1, which we can take to satisfy the normalization condition
(4.10). evidently, (0)
 = 1. let 2 be the second basis vector in the basis with respect
to which l(x0) takes the jordan form (4.13), i.e., l(x0)2 = y12 + 1. then the second
equation above is solved by

 and (1)

(1)

 = (

y1


2 + 1),

(4.18)

where the constant  is chosen so that p3

=1 (1),

 = 0.

 outside a nite number of points x, the matrix l(x) has 3 distinct eigenvalues y(a)
and three distinct eigenfunctions 0(a), 1  a  3, normalized uniquely by the condition
(4.10). the function

det2{0(1) 0(2) 0(3)}

(4.19)

is independent of the ordering of both 0(a) and the corresponding eigenvalues y(a). by the
preceding observations, it can be expressed as a rational function of x and y(a), which is
also symmetric under permutations of y(a). thus it is actually an unambiguous and rational
function of x. we observe that the function det2{0(1) 0(2) 0(3)} vanishes at exactly
those values of x which are branch points for the spectral curve det(yi  l(x)) = 0. indeed,
we saw earlier that the branch points x0 are exactly the points where l(x0) has multiple
eigenvalues. outside points x0 where l(x0) has multiple eigenvalues, the determinant (4.19)
is readily seen to be 6= 0 (it may be innite, because of the normalization (4.10)). conversely,
assume that x0 is a branch point. then our preceding discussion shows that for x near x0

det2{0(1) 0(2) 0(3)}(x) = (x  x0)det2{1 2 0(3)} + o(x  x0)3/2

(4.20)

14

this shows that det2{0(1) 0(2) 0(3)}(x0) = limxx0det2{0(1) 0(2) 0(3)}(x) = 0,
establishing the observation. furthermore, since the vectors 1, 2, and 0(3) are linearly
independent by construction, we obtain the important fact that the order of vanishing of the
square of the determinant in (4.19) at a branch point is exactly 1. (more generally, for an
arbitrary branching index b, the order of vanishing of the square of the determinant is equal
to b  1, although we do not need this more general version here, thanks to our genericity
assumption on the moduli ui.)

 we can now determine the number of poles of the bloch function 0(q) outside of the
points pa above x = . clearly, this number is half of the number of poles of the expression
(4.19) outside of x = . now at x = , we saw that the operator l(x) has 3 eigenvalues,
so that (4.19) does not vanish there. furthermore, we shall show later that 0(q) is nite at
all three points above x = . thus (4.19) has neither a zero nor a pole at x = . in view
of the preceding discussion, the number of zeroes of (4.19) is equal to the number of branch
points of . we showed earlier, using the riemann-hurwitz formula, that the number of
branch points of  is 4n + 2. it follows that the number of poles, and hence of zeroes of
0(q) on  is 2n + 1.

 the poles of n(q) outside of the points pa lying above x =  are independent of n.
to see this, we let s0(x) be the 3  3 identity matrix i, and set sn(x) = ln1(x)sn1(x) =

q0kn1 lk(x). then n(q) can be expressed as
n(q) = ln1(x)n1(q) = y0kn1

lk(x)0(q) = sn(x)0(x)

(4.21)

this shows that the poles of n(q) outside of pa can only occur at the poles of 0(q). for
generic values of the moduli ui, we can assume that all the poles of n(q), 0  n  n + 1,
are exactly of the same order 1 when they occur outside of the points pa above x = .

 let d = {z1,    , z2n +1} be the divisor of poles of the bloch function n(q). then a
fundamental property of the even divisor spin chain model is the invariance of the equivalence
divisor class [d] of d under the involution 

[d] = [d]

(4.22)

in other words, there exists a meromorphic function on  with poles at zn and z
consequence of how l(x) transforms under the involution x  x, y  y1

n. this is a

l(x) = g0l(x)1g0.

(4.23)

this transformation rule implies that g00(q) is a bloch function at (x, y1) if 0(q) is a
bloch function at (x, y). thus g00(q) must coincide with 0(q) up to normalization

g00(q) = f (q)0(q)

(4.24)

since both 0(q) and 0(q) are meromorphic functions, the function f (q) is meromorphic.
this proves (4.22).

we summarize the discussion in the following lemma:

15

lemma 4.1 the vector-function n(q) is a meromorphic vector-function on . outside
the punctures pa (which are the points of  situated over x = ) it has g + 2 = 2n + 1
poles {z1, . . . , z2n +1}, which are n-independent. the divisor class [d] of d is invariant with
respect to the involution , i.e. there exists a function f (q) on  with poles at zj and zeroes
at z
j .

4.3 the direct problem

in the previous discussion, we made use only of the fact that the curve r(x, y) = 0 is the
spectral curve of a matrix l(x) which satises the involution condition l(x) = l(x)1.
in particular, the discussion applies for generic values of the moduli ui parametrizing the
curves.

we consider now the direct problem for the system (1.6), where the matrix l(x) arises
n=0 ln(x) =
n ). the discussion in the previous section has provided a precise description
it is also evident that the map descends to the

more specically in terms of the dynamical variables (qn, pn) as l(x) = qn +1
qn +1

of the right hand side of the map (4.1).
equivalence classes of (qn, pn) under the gauge group g.

n=0 (1 + xqnpt

it is convenient to exploit the gauge transformation (1.8) to normalize the bloch functions
at x = 0. first, we observe that ln(0) = i for all n, so that n(qa) is independent of n.
furthermore, the lax operator l(x) can be written near x = 0 as

where the matrix t is given by

l(x) = i + xt + o(x2)

in particular, t satises the condition

t =

n +1

xn=0

qnpt
n

t = g0t g0.

(4.25)

(4.26)

(4.27)

in view of the constraint pn = g0pn1, qn = g0qn1. next, recall from our discussion of the
landsteiner-lopez curve in 2 that t has 3 distinct eigenvalues y1(qa), and that y can be
expanded as y = 1+y1(q)x+o(x2) near qa. expanding 0(q) near qa as 0(q) = 0(qa)+
o(x), and using the preceding expansion for l(x), the condition l(x)0(q) = y0(q) for
bloch functions can be rewritten as

(i + xt )(0(qa) + x

0(qa)) = (1 + yax)(0(qa) + x

0(qa)) + o(x2)

this implies

t 0(qa) = ya0(qa)

(4.28)

(4.29)

i.e., 0(qa) are precisely the three eigenvectors of t , corresponding to the eigenvalues ya. if
we let 0(0) be the 3  3 matrix whose columns are the vectors 0(qa), then the transfor-
mation law (4.27) implies that 0(0) satises the condition

0(0) = g00(0)g0.

(4.30)

16

now the transformation (1.8) on (qn, pn) does not change the curve  and the divisor d, but
changes the matrix 0(0) into w 0(0). but 0(0) commutes with the matrix g0, and hence
so does its inverse. this means that the inverse qualies as one of the gauge transformations
w allowed in (1.8). under such a gauge transformation w , the bloch function 0(0) gets
transformed to the identity

henceforth we can assume then this normalization, and pn, qn satises the condition

0(0) = i.

(4.31)

(4.32)

our main task is to establish that the map (4.2) is generically locally invertible. this is
the goal of the next section on the inverse spectral problem, but in order to motivate the
constructions given there, we identify here the basic behavior of the bloch function n(x, y)
near the points p above x = . for (x, y) near p, set

n(x, y) = xpn

n,k(p)xk



xk=0

(4.33)

here pn is the order of the pole (or zero when pn < 0) of n(x, y) near p, which may
vary with both n and . the following lemma identies the coecients n,k(p) up to
normalization:

lemma 4.2  in the neighborhood of the puncture p1 (where y = o(xn +2)), the vector-
function n has a pole of order n and the leading coecient n,0(p1) of its expansion is equal
to

where the scalar n satisfy the recurrence relation

n,0(p1) = nqn1,

n+1 = (pt

n qn1)n.

the next coecient n,1(p1) satises

n+1,1 = n,0 + qn(pt

n n,1)

(4.34)

(4.35)

(4.36)

 in the neighborhood of the puncture p3 (where y = o(xn 2)) the vector-function n has
a zero of order n and the leading coecient n,0(p3) of its expansion is equal to

where the scalar n satises the recurrence relation

n,0(p3) = nqn,

n+1 = 

1

(pt

n qn+1)

n.

(4.37)

(4.38)

 in the neighborhood of the puncture p2 (where y = 1) the vector-function n is regular and
its evaluation n,0(p2) at p2 is orthogonal to both pn and pn1, i.e.,

pt
n n,0(p2) = pt

n1n,0(p2) = 0.

(4.39)

17

proof. first, we show that for generic moduli, the bloch function 0(x, y) is regular near each
p. observe that n +2(x, y) = l(x)0(x, y) = y0(x, y). now the relation n+1 = ln(x)n
can be inverted to produce

n(x, y) = ln(x)1n+1(x, y) = (1  xqnpt

n )n+1(x, y)

(4.40)

applying this relation n + 2 times, we may write

0(x, y) = y(1  xq0pt

0 )    (1  xqn +1pt

n +1)0(x, y)

consider rst the neighborhood of the point p3, where y is of order x(n +2).

0,0 = ()n +2q0(pt

(4.41)

if 0(x, y)

implies that p3
for generic values of the moduli of the curve , we may assume that p3

this shows that 0,0(p3) is proportional to the vector q0, say 0,0 = q0. now recall that
the bloch function 0(x, y) satises the normalization condition (4.10) throughout. this
=1 0,0(p3) = 0 if the order n0(p3) of the pole of 0(x, y) at p3 is positive.
it
follows that 0 = 0 and hence 0,0(p3) = 0, which contradicts the denition of 0,0(p3).
this shows that n0(p3) = 0, and the bloch function 0(x, y) is regular at p3. the arguments
near p1 is similar and even more direct, just using the equation y0(x, y) = n +2(x, y) =
incidentally, that the leading coecient 0,0(p1) is
proportional to qn +1. at p2, the regularity of 0(x, y) follows from the regularity of 0(x, y)
at the other two points p1 and p3, and from the fact that for generic moduli, the determinant
(4.19) is regular.

it shows,

it is now easy to see that the functions n(x, y) have the zeroes and poles spelled out in

4.4 the inverse spectral problem

it is now a standard procedure in the geometric theory of soliton equations to solve the
inverse problem using the concept of the baker-akhiezer function originally proposed in
[22]. the main properties of the baker-akhiezer function in our model are the following.

 let  be a landsteiner-lopez curve dened by equation (2.1). then for a divisor d
of degree g + 2 = 2n + 1 in general position, there exists a unique vector-function n(t, q)
such that:

(a) n(t, q) is meromorphic on  outside the punctures p1, p3. it has at most simple

poles at the points zi of the divisor d (if all of them are distinct);

(b) in the neighborhood of the punctures p1 and p3, it has respectively the form

n = xnext  
xk=0
n = xnext  
xk=0

n,k(p1)xk! , q  p1,
n,k(p3)xk! , q  p3,

(c) at the points qa, n(q) is regular, and n(qa) is equal to

n,(t, q) = ,.

(4.50)

(4.51)

(4.52)

the arguments establishing the existence of the baker-akhiezer function n are well-
known, so we shall be brief. first, we recall that as shown in [22] for any algebraic curve with
two punctures, any xed local coordinate in the respective neighborhoods of the punctures,
and for any divisor d of degree g there exists a unique (up to a constant factor) function
with the analytic properties stated above. now let (p1, p3) be the punctures, and let x1
be the local coordinate near either one of the punctures. we can easily show that if d
has degree g + 2, the dimension of the space of such functions is equal to 3. we form the
3-dimensional vector whose components are just the three independent functions from this
space. this 3-dimensional vector is unique up to multiplication by a constant matrix. we
x this matrix by the normalization condition (4.52). this establishes our claim.

the function n(t, q) can be written explicitly in terms of the riemann -function as-
sociated with . the -function is an entire function of g = 2n  1 complex variables
z = (z1, . . . , zg), and is dened by its fourier expansion

(z1, . . . , zg) = xmzg e2i<m,z>+i< m,m>,

where  = ij is the period matrix of . the -function has the following monodromy
properties with respect to the lattice zg +  zg

(z + l) = (z),

(z +  l) = exp[i <  l, l > 2i < l, z >] (z)

where l is an integer vector, l  zg. the complex torus j() = cg/zg +  zg is the jacobian
variety of the curve . the abel transform

imbeds the curve  into its jacobian variety. here dk is a basis of g holomorphic dierentials,
normalized as dual to the a-cycles of a symplectic homology basis for .

according to the riemann  roch theorem, for each divisor d = z1 + . . . + zg+2 in the
general position, there exists a unique meromorphic function r(q) with r(q) =  and
d as the divisor of its poles. it can be written explicitly as (see details in [23]):

r(q) =

let d0 and d1 be the unique normalized meromorphic dierentials on , which are
holomorphic outside p1 and p3, and with the property that d0 has simple poles at the
punctures with residues 1, d1 is regular at p3, and has the form d1 = dx(1 + o(x1))
at p1. the normalization means that the dierentials have zero periods around a-cycles

we observe that the dierential d
form dx(1 + o(x1).

the baker-akhiezer function n(t, q) is given by

 the baker-akhiezer function n is a bloch function, in the sense that

n +2+n(t, q) = yn(t, q).

(4.54)

this is just a consequence of the fact that both sides of the equation satisfy the criteria for
the baker-akhiezer function, and that the baker-akhiezer function is unique. similarly, the
uniqueness of the baker-akhiezer function implies that, if the divisor d is equivalent to d,
then the function n satises

n(t, q) = g0n(t, q)f (q),

s . without loss of generality, we

 let n(t, q) be the baker-akhiezer function corresponding to  and the divisor d
of degree 2g + 2. let pn(t) be a vector orthogonal to n,0(p3, t) (the leading term in the
expansion (4.50)), and to n(t, p2), i.e.

and qn be the vector

pt

n n(t, p2) = 0,

qn =

n,0(p1)
pt
n n1,0(p1)

.

(4.56)

(4.57)

the vector functions pn, qn are then (n + 2)-periodic and mutually orthogonal, and they
satisfy the contraint (4.31). as can be expected from the gauge invariance (1.7) in the
direct problem, the functions pn(t) and qn(t) which we obtain this way are dened only
up to a multiplier n(t). however, the operators ln and mn(x) are uniquely dened by
the expression (4.3). furthermore, again by uniqueness of the baker-akhiezer function, the
baker-akhiezer function n(q) satises

n+1(t, q) = ln(x)n(t, q),

(t  mn(x))n(t, q) = 0.

(4.58)

thus the vector function (qn(t), pn(t) is a solution of the dynamical system (1.6).
if the
equivalence class of the divisor d is invariant with respect to , then (pn, qn) satises in
addition the relation (1.4).

 the baker-akhiezer function n(t, q) satises the same dening bloch property (4.54)
as the bloch function n(q), except for the dierent normalizations, which is (4.52) in the
case of n(t, q) and (4.10) in the case of n(q). it follows that

n(t, q) = r1(t, q)n(t, q), r(t, q) =

3

x=1

0,(q)

(4.59)

is a bloch solution of (4.9) normalized by the condition (4.10). this leads to the following
description of the dynamical system (1.6).

let pn(t), qn(t) be vector functions (subject to constraints (1.3,1.4,4.31) ) which satisfy

the equations (1.6). then the t-dependence of the divisor d under the map (4.1)

(pn(t), qn(t)) 7 {, d(t) =

2n +1

xj=1

zj(t)}

(4.60)

coincides with the dynamics of the zeroes of the function r(t, q) given by (4.59). the
dynamics of the bloch eigenfunction of (4.9) (i.e. normalized by (4.10)) are described by

(t  mn(t, x))n(t, q) = (t, q)n(t, q),  = t ln r(t, q)

(4.61)

we observe that the linearization of the equations of motion on the jacobian of the curve is
a direct corollary of the linear dependence on t of the exponential factor in the expansion of
n(t, q) near the punctures.

21

 as we saw earlier, the normalization (4.31) can be achieved by the action (1.8) of a
subgroup of matrices w which commutes with g0. in order to get m, we have to consider
in addition the action of diagonal matrices w . the basic observation is the following.

let the baker-akhiezer functions n(t, q) and (t, q) corresponds to equivalent divisors

d and d, respectively. then



n(t, q) = w n(t, q)h(q),

(4.62)

where h(q) is a function with poles at d and zeros at d, and w is a diagonal matrix
w = h1(q),. to establish (4.62), it suces to check that both sides of the equation
have the same analytical properties. the equation (4.62) implies that the vectors pn, qn
dened by equivalent divisors are related by a transformation (1.8) with a diagonal matrix
w . altogether, we have established the following part of the main theorem of 1:

theorem 1. the map (4.1) identies the reduced phase space m with a bundle over the
space of algebraic curves  dened by (2.1) with fn (x) of the form (2.2). at generic data,
the map has bijective dierential. the ber of the bundle is the jacobian j(0) of the factor-
curve 0 = /.

m = {, [d]  j(0)}

5 hamiltonian theory and seiberg-witten dierential:

the even divisor model

we come now to the crucial issue of how to determine the symplectic forms with respect
to which the system (1.6) is hamiltonian. for this, we rely on the hamiltonian approach
proposed in [6] and [7] for general soliton equations expressible in terms of lax or zakharov-
shabat equations. this approach was eective in the study of gauge theories with matter in
the fundamental representation. further applications were given in [10] and [24]. we review
its main features.

5.1 the symplectic forms in terms of the lax operator

in order to nd the hamiltonian structure of the equations starting with the lax operator,
we need to identify a two-form on the phase space m of vectors (qn, pn), written in term of
the lax operator l(x). candidates for such two-forms are

(m) =

n+1(q)ln(x)  n(q) >

(5.1)

the various expressions in this equation are dened as follows. the notation < fn > stands
for a sum over one period of the periodic function fn:

< fn >=

note that (4.9) and (5.3) imply that 
nn
does not depend on n. we would also like to emphasize that, unlike the bloch function
n(q) which does not have n-independent zeroes, the normalization (5.4) allows the dual
bloch function 

n(q) to have such zeroes. in fact, they occur at the poles of n(q).

n+1(ln(x)n) = (

n+1ln(x))n = 

in (5.1), the dierential  denotes the exterior dierential with respect to the moduli
parameters of m. (this is in order to distinguish  from the dierential d, which is the
exterior dierential on the surface .) thus the external dierential ln(z) can be viewed
as a one-form on m, valued in the space of operator-valued meromorphic functions on .
similarly the bloch function n(q) and dual bloch functions 
n(q) are functions on m,
valued respectively in the space of column-vector-valued and the space of row-vector-valued
meromorphic functions on . it follows that n(q) is a one-form on m, valued in the space
of column-vector-valued meromorphic functions on . the expression 
n+1ln(x)  n(x)
is then a two-form on m, valued in the space of meromorphic functions on , and for each
m integer, the expression

(m) =< 

n+1ln(x)  n(x) >

dx
xm

(5.5)

is a meromorphic 1-form on . this justies (5.1) as a two-form on m.

in (5.1), we have allowed for a later choice of an integer m. we shall see shortly that
holomorphicity requirements restrict to 0  m  2, and that the symplectic form of the
n = 2 susy with a hypermultiplet in the anti-symmetric representation is obtained by
setting m = 0.

sometimes it is useful to think of the symplectic form  as

where n(x) is a matrix with the columns n(qj(x)), qj(x) = (x, yj) corresponding to
dierent sheets of . the matrix n(x) is of course not dened globally. note that 
n(q)

sequel.

5.2 the symplectic forms in terms of x and y

a remarkable property of the symplectic form dened by (5.1) in terms of the lax oper-
ator l(x) is that it can, under quite general circumstances, be rewritten in terms of the

23

meromorphic functions x and y on the spectral curve . more precisely, we have

(m) = 

2n +1

xi=1

 ln y(zi) 

x
xm (zi).

(5.7)

the meaning of the right hand side of this formula is as follows. the spectral curve is
equipped by denition with the meromorphic functions y(q) and x(q). their evaluations
x(zi), y(zi) at the points zi dene functions on the space m, and the wedge product of their
external dierentials is a two-form on m.

the proof of the formula (5.7) is very general and does not rely on any specic form of
ln. for the sake of completeness we present it here in detail, although it is very close to the
proof of lemma 5.1 in [24].

recall that the expression (m) dened in (5.5) is a meromorphic dierential on the
spectral curve . therefore, the sum of its residues at the punctures p is equal to the
opposite of the sum of the other residues on . for m  2, the dierential (m) is regular
at the points situated over x = 0, thanks to the normalization (4.31), which insures that
n(q) = o(x). otherwise, it has poles at the poles zi of n(q) and at the branch points
si, where we have seen that 
n+1(q) has poles. we analyze in turn the residues at each of
these two types of poles.

first, we consider the poles zi of n(q). by genericity, these poles are all distinct and of

rst order, and we may write

n  n,0(zi)

1

x  x(zi)

+   

it follows that n has a pole of second order at zi

n = n,0(zi)

x(zi)

(x  x(zi))2 +   

in view of the fact that 

n+1 has a simple zero at zi and hence can be expressed as

n+1  


n+1,0(x  x(zi)) +    ,

we obtain

reszi(m) =< 

n+1,0lnn > 

x
xm (zi) =< 

n+1lnn > 

x
xm (zi).

(5.8)

(5.9)

(5.10)

(5.11)

the key observation now is that the right hand side can be rewritten in terms of the mon-
odromy matrix l(x). in fact, the recursive relations (4.9) and (5.3) imply that

< 

n+1lnn > = <

an operator, 

0y0. altogether, we have found that

0l0 = 

reszi(m) =  ln y(zi) 

x
xm (zi).

(5.15)

the second set of poles of (m) is the set of branching points si of the cover. the pole of

n at si cancels with the zero of the dierential dx, dx(si) = 0, considered as a dierential
on . the vector-function n is holomorphic at si. however, n can develop a pole as we
see below. if we take an expansion of n in the local coordinate (x  x(si))1/2 (in general
position when the branching point is simple) and consider its variation we get

n = n,0 + n,(x  x(si))1/2 +   

n =

comparing with dn

(xx(si))1/2 +   , we may write

n =

x(si) + o(1).

this shows that n has a simple pole at si. similarly, we may write

y =

dx

x(si) + o(1).

the identities (5.18) and (5.19) imply that

ressi(m) = ressi"<

(5.18)

(5.20)

(5.21)

due to the antisymmetry of the wedge product, we may replace l in (5.21) by (l  y).
then using the identities


n +2(l  y) = 

n +2(y  l)

(y  l)d0 = (dl  dy)0,

which result from 

n +2(l  y) = (l  y)0 = 0, we obtain

antisymmetry of the wedge product, we arrive at

00 = y1. thus 

n +20 = 

ressi = ressi(cid:16)

(5.25)

recall that we have normalized the bloch function 0(q) at x = 0 by (4.31), and that
near x = 0, the function y is of the form (2.4). thus 0 = o(x) and y = o(x) near x = 0,
and the dierential form

(cid:16)
n +20(cid:17)  y

(5.26)

is holomorphic at x = 0 for 0  m  2. it is manifestly holomorphic at all the other points

2n +1

the sum of (5.15) and (5.28) gives (5.7), since

the identity (5.7) is proved.

5.3 action-angle variables and seiberg-witten dierential

the expression (5.7) for the symplectic form (m) suggests its close relation with the following
one-form on 

d(m) = ln y

dx
xm

(5.30)

strictly speaking, the form d(m) is not a meromorphic dierential in the usual sense, because
of the multiple-valuedness of ln y. however, the ambiguities in ln y are xed multiples of
2i, which disappear upon dierentiation. thus, the form d(m) is no dierent from the
usual meromorphic dierentials, as far as the construction of symplectic forms is concerned.
also, the form d(m) and the form 1
y ) dier by
an exact dierential, and we shall not distinguish between them. from this point of view,
the seiberg-witten form (1.1) can be identied with the form d(0).

y (for m 6= 1; for m = 1, (ln x) dy

m1xm+1 dy

our spin chain model has led so far to a 2n-dimensional phase space m, equipped with
several candidate symplectic forms (m), 1  m  2. we still have to reduce m to a

26

(2n  2)-dimensional phase space, and to identify the correct symplectic form. remarkably,
both selections are tied to a key physical requirement for the one-form which corresponds
to the seiberg-witten of a n = 2 susy gauge theory, namely the holomorphicity of its
variations under moduli deformations.

it is an important feature of n = 2 yang-mills theories that the masses of the theory
are not renormalized. since the masses of the theory correspond to the poles of the seiberg-
witten dierential d, it follows that d must be holomorphic. thus we need to examine the
poles of  d =  ln y dx
xm , and identify the subvarieties of m along which d is holomorphic.
there are 3 such subvarieties, corresponding to the choices of m:

 on the variety m2 = m  {u0 = c0, u1 = c1}, the dierential  d(2) = ( ln y) dx
x2
has no pole at q, since y = 1 + o(x2) near x = 0. on the other hand, the dierential dx
x2
vanishes at x = , so  ln y dx

x2 is also holomorphic there, and d(2) is holomorphic.

 on the variety m0 = m  {un = 1, un 1 = 0}, the dierential  d(0) = ( ln y)dx
is automatically holomorphic at x = 0. near , in view of the expansion () for y, we have
 ln y = o(x2) if we vary only the moduli within m2. thus d(0) is holomorphic.

 on the variety m1 = m  {un = 1}, the dierential  d(1) = ( ln y) dx

x is still
holomorphic, because  ln y = o(x). near x = , the sole constraint {un 1 = 1} suces to
guarantee that  ln y = o( 1

x). thus d(1) is holomorphic.

when m and hence d(m) is even under the involution , action-angle variables can
be introduced as follows. restricted to m(m), d(m) is holomorphic, and hence can be
expressed for suitable coecients ai as

d(m) =

2n 1

(ai)di,

xi=1

(5.31)

where di is a basis of 2n  1 holomorphic one-forms on . since d(m) is even, only
holomorphic one-forms di which are even can occur on the right hand side. we identify
such forms with forms on /. we choose a symplectic homology basis ai, bi and a dual
basis of holomorphic forms di, 1  i  n  1, for the factor curve /. the variables ai
and adi can then be dened by

ai = iai

d(m),

adi = ibi

d(m).

(5.32)

the interpretation of the variables ai is as action variables from the viewpoint of the spin
model and as vacuum moduli from the viewpoint of the n = 2 susy gauge theory. evi-
dently, their variations coincide with the ai of the equation (5.31).

next, the angle variables i, 1  i  n  1, are dened by

d = {z1,    , z2n +1} 7 i =

2n +1

xj=1 z zj

di

(5.33)

27

we claim now that, for m even, the symplectic form (m) is a genuine symplectic form when
restricted to m(m), and that ai and i as dened above are action-angle coordinates for (m)

(m) =

n 1

xi=1

ai  i

on m(m).

(5.34)

to see this, we evaluate the two-form (p2n +1

in (5.31), we nd that it is equal to

j=1

q0  d) in two dierent ways. substituting

r zj

(

(5.36)

comparing the two formulas, and making use of (5.7), we obtain the desired equation (5.34).

we observe that for the present even divisor spin model, the space m1 and the form
d(1) are not applicable. in fact, there are diculties with both the dimension of m1 which
is odd, and the angle variables i dened by (5.33), which would vanish identically because
the class of the divisor d is even.

for the n = 2 susy yang-mills theory with a hypermultiplet in the antisymmetric
representation, the spectral curves are given by m0. the symplectic form is then (0), which
provides an independent check of the choice of seiberg-witten form found by landsteiner
and lopez.

5.4 the hamiltonian of the flow

we show now that the even divisor spin model is a hamiltonian system. more precisely,
restricted to each of the phase space m(0) or m(2), the system is hamiltonian with the
corresponding symplectic form, with a corresponding hamiltonian. we would like to stress
that, once again, the arguments to these ends are quite general, and use only the expression
for (m) in terms of the lax operator.

lemma 5.1 let m be either 0 or 2. then the equations (1.6) restricted on m(m) are
hamiltonian with respect to the symplectic form (m) given by (5.1). the hamiltonians h(m)
are given by

h(0) = un 2

h(2) = ln un =

(5.37)

(5.38)

proof. by denition, a vector eld t on a symplectic manifold is hamiltonian, if its con-
traction it(x) = (x, t) with the symplectic form is an exact one-form h(x). the
function h is the hamiltonian corresponding to the vector eld t. thus

it(m) =

now under the ow (1.6), the lax operators ln(x) ow according to the lax equation (4.4),
while the bloch function n ow according to (4.61). consequently,

since lnn = n+1, it follows that 
upon averaging in n, we obtain

n+1mn+1lnn =

n+1(mn+1ln  lnmn)n >=  <

for all n, both ln(x) and mn(x) vanish at x = 0. the dierential form

(5.41)

(5.42)

is thus holomorphic at x = 0, in both cases m = 0 and m = 2. as we have seen, outside
of x = , the poles of 
n+1 are at the branch ponits and are cancelled by the zeroes of dx
there, while the poles of n are cancelled by the zeroes of 
n+1. thus the above dierential
form is holomorphic outside of x = 0. the sum of its residues at p must be zero

(5.43)

(5.44)

(5.45)

as follows from (4.50,4.51), and (4.61) the function (t, q) is holomorphic at p2, while it
has the following expansion at the punctures p1, p3

(t, q) = x + o(1), q  p1; (t, q) = x + o(1), q  p3.

(5.46)

we consider now the cases m = 2 and m = 0 separately. when m = 2, the form  dx
x2 is regular
at p2, and has simple poles with opposite residues at p1 and p3. since  ln y = un + o( 1
x)
near p1, it follows immediately that

it(2) = (ln un ).

(5.47)

29

when m = 0, we observe that the form ( ln y)dx is regular at x = . indeed, the con-
straints un = 1, un 1 = 0 dening the phase space m0 in this case imply that  ln y = o( 1
x2 )
near all three points p1, p2, and p3. for p1 and p3, this statement is a direct consequence of
(2.7) and (2.8). for p2, this follows from the fact that the three roots y of the landsteiner-
=1 y = 1. returning to the residues in (5.45), we see that
the point p2 does not contribute. as for the points p1 and p3, they contribute exactly the
coecient un 2 in the expansions (2.7) and (2.8) for y

lopez curve (2.1) must satisfy q3

it(0) = un 2.

(5.48)

the lemma is proved.

5.5 the symplectic form in terms of (pn, qn)

the expression (5.1) for the symplectic forms (m) in terms of the lax operator also provides
a straightforward way of writing (m) in terms of the dynamical variables (qn, pn). such an
expression for the form (0) appears complicated. but it is quite simple for the form (2),
and we derive it here.

we have ln = x (qnpt

be evaluated as follows.

at the point p1, y = o(xn +2), n = o(xn), n+1 = o(x(n+1)), and thus the dierential

x2 is regular. the residue at p1 vanishes.

< 

at the point p2, n and 

n+1 are regular. using the same notation as in (4.33), we write
n = n,0 + n,1x1 +   

n+1 =

(5.49)

(5.50)

in analogy with (ref), from the equation

n+1 =

it follows that

the residue at p2 is then readily identied

they imply that

as a consequence, the rst term on the right hand side of () simplies to

n+1,0(qnpt

now recall that we introduced the coecient n by n = nqn. comparing with the equation

rewritten as

altogether, we obtain the following expression for the residue at p3

where the terms ii and iii are dened by

ii = [

iii = pt

(5.64)

(5.65)

(5.66)

(5.67)

(5.68)

in fact, in view of the recursion relations (5.59) and the fact that n = nqn, it can be
rewritten as

iii = 

n,0qn)(pt

n qn  n + pt

n  (n)qn + pt

n  nqn)

(5.69)

the rst two terms on the right hand side cancel, since pt
we note that the normalization 
nn = 1 implies near p3

n qn = 0. as for the remaining term,

1 = (

n,0xn + o(xn1))(nqnxn + o(xn1)) = 

n,0nqn + o(x1)

(5.70)

31

from which it follows that 

n,0nqn = 1. the identity (5.68) is established.

finally, it is readily seen that the remaining terms i and ii combine into

i + ii = 

respa < 

n+1qn  pt

(5.71)

xa=1
n n > dx

but the 1-form <

ii+iii as residues at qa

n+1 = 

at x = 0, we have 
n, and this expression is determined by the normalization
condition (4.31) on the matrix w . in terms of n, the normalization (4.31) can be restated
as the normalization condition 
n = i as an identity between 3  3 matrices. thus
i + ii = 3 < qn  pn >, and we obtain the nal formula for the symplectic form  in terms

6 hamiltonian theory and seiberg-witten dierential:

the odd divisor model

the main dierence between the even and the odd divisor spin models is in the parity of
the divisor d of poles of the bloch function n(q). for the odd divisor spin model, d is
essentially odd under the involution  : (x, y)  (x, y1) in the following sense

[d] + [d] = k + 2

3

x=1

p

(6.1)

here k is the canonical class, which is the divisor class of any meromorphic 1-forms on
. as in the case of the even divisor spin model, the relation (6.1) is a consequence of the
transformation of l(x) under , which is in this case l(x) = (l(x)1)t . this implies that
0(q) and 0(q) are both dual bloch functions for l(x), and thus

0(q) = 0(q)f (q)


(6.2)

where f (q) is a meromorphic function on . but the zeroes of the dual bloch function 
0
are exactly the poles of 0(q), while its poles are exactly the branch points of the surface
. thus the preceding equation implies the following equation for divisor classes

[branch points]  [d] = [d]

(6.3)

to determine the divisor of the branch points of , we consider the dierential dx, viewed
as a meromorphic form on . since dx has a pole of order 2 at each pa, and a zero at

32

each branch point, we have [branch points]  2p3

follows.

a=1 pa = k, and the desired relation (6.1)

 we discuss briey the direct and the inverse problems for the odd divisor spin system.
once the dierence in parity of the divisor of poles of the bloch functions is taken into
account, the direct problem is treated in exactly the same way as before. as for the inverse
problem, we need only a few minor modications in expansions near the punctures p1, p3,
which we give (c.f. (4.50, 4.51) now

n = xnext  
xk=0
n = xnext  
xk=0

n,k(p1)xk! , q  p1,
n,k(p3)xk! , q  p3,

(6.4)

(6.5)

they lead to minor modications in the exact formulas for the baker-akhiezer function
n(t, q) (c.f. (4.53)):

n,(t, q) = r(q)

(a(q) + tu  + nv + z) (z0)
(a(q) + z) (tu  + nv + z0)

exp z q

q

nd0 + td!

(6.6)

where d = d1  d

1 and u  = u  u .

we show that if the divisor d satises (6.1), then the corresponding baker-akhiezer

function satises the relation

where as before 

n are the rows of the matrix inverse to the matrix

n(t, q) = t


n (t, q)f (q),



n,(x) = n,(p)

(6.7)

(6.8)

here the points p(x) are the three preimages of x on  on dierent sheets. of course, the
matrix n(x) does depend on the ordereing of sheets, but one can check that if for p(x)
we dene 
n is well-dened. as
before 

n has poles at all the branching points and zeroes at the points of the divisor d.

n(p) as the corresponding row of the inverse matrix, then 

to establish (6.7), we show that

n,(t, p(x))

n,(t, p)f (p) = ,

(6.9)

x

indeed, from (6.4) and (6.5), it follows that the function n,(t, q)n,(q)f (q) is holomor-
phic everywhere except at the branching points (the poles and the essential singularities at
the punctures p over x =  cancel each other; there are no poles at d and d because
f (q) has zeros at these points). therefore, the left hand side of the above equation is a
holomorphic function of x (the poles at the branching points cancel upon the summation).
hence it is a constant, which can be found by taking x = 0.

the uniqueness of n and the relation (6.7) implies as before that it satisfy the equation

n+1 = ln(x)n, tn = mn(x)n

(6.10)

33

where ln and mn have the form (3.4,3.5).

 we come now to the hamiltonian structure of the odd divisor spin model. recall that
we had introduced the space modd of spin chains. solving the direct and inverse spectral
problem as in the case of the even divisor spin model, we can identity modd with the space
of geometric data

modd

1  {, d; [d] + [d] = k + 2

3

x=1

p}

(6.11)

we can verify that the space on the right hand side is 2n + 1 dimensional, as it should be:
there are n + 1 moduli parameters for the curve , and n parameters for the antisymmetric
divisor [d]. the same discussion as in 5.3 and 5.4 for the even divisor spin model shows
that, in the present case, the only candidate for symplectic form is the form (1), restricted
to the 2n-dimensional phase space modd

dened by

1

the corresponding action and angle variables are now given by

modd

1 = modd  {un = 1}
