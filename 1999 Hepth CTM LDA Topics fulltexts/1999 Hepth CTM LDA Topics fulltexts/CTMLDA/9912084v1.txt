abstract

we apply the new orbifold duality transformations to discuss the special case of
cyclic coset orbifolds in further detail. we focus in particular on the case of the in-
teracting cyclic coset orbifolds, whose untwisted sectors are z(permutation)-invariant
g/h coset constructions which are not  copies of coset constructions. because  copies
are not involved, the action of z(permutation) in the interacting cyclic coset orbifolds
can be quite intricate. the stress tensors and ground state conformal weights of all the
sectors of a large class of these orbifolds are given explicitly and special emphasis is
placed on the twisted h subalgebras which are generated by the twisted (0,0) operators
of these orbifolds. we also discuss the systematics of twisted (0,0) operators in general
coset orbifolds.

1 introduction

in ref. [1] a construction of the stress tensors of all the sectors of all current-algebraic
orbifolds

(1.1)

a(h)

h

was given, where h is any nite group and a(h) is any h-invariant cft24 constructed
on ane lie algebra57. this technology employs new duality transformations among the
sectors of each orbifold, and, in particular, the special case of cyclic permutation orbifolds

a(z)

z

(1.2)

was worked out in full as an illustration.

the untwisted sectors of the permutation orbifolds a(z)/z are described by the set
of all z(permutation)-invariant cfts a(z), that is by all the z(permutation)-invariant
ane-virasoro8,9,4 constructions lab

ij on ane g, where

g = 1

i=0 gi,

gi = g,

z(permutation)  aut(g).

(1.3)

here z(permutation) acts by permuting the copies {gi} at level k of the ane algebra on
simple g. in this case the twisted current algebras of the twisted sectors are orbifold ane
algebras10,11,1, and the duality transformations relating the sectors of the orbifolds a(z)/z
are discrete fourier transforms.

in this paper, we apply the results of ref. [1] for a(z)/z to study the set of cyclic

coset orbifolds

in further detail. these orbifolds, rst delineated in ref. [1], are the special cases in a(z)/z
for which the z(permutation)-invariant cft a(z) is a coset construction7,12,13. in what
follows, an algebra h(z) which satises (1.4b) is called a z-covariant subalgebraa of the
ambient algebra g.

asince the stress tensor tg of g denes a z(permutation)-invariant cft, the property (1.4b) is a necessary
and sucient condition so that the stress tensors th(z) and tg/h(z) also dene z(permutation)-invariant
cfts.

are well-known examples whose stress tensors in the untwisted sectors are sums of  commut-
ing copies. in these orbifolds, the action of z(permutation) consists of cyclic permutations
of the coset copies. the stress tensors of all the twisted sectors of all cyclic copy orbifolds
are given in ref. [1]. the case of prime  was given earlier in refs. [10,11] and copy orbifolds
have also been studied in refs. [14-18]. as a consequence, our remarks will be minimal for
these cases.

we focus instead on a more intricate class of cyclic coset orbifolds called the interacting
cyclic coset orbifolds10,11,1 because their stress tensors in the untwisted sectors are not sums
of  commuting copies. as a consequence, the action of z(permutation) in the interacting
coset orbifolds is generally more involved than the action of z(permutation) in the coset
copy orbifolds. the simplest examples of interacting cyclic coset orbifolds are the cases

( g

z

(1.6)

where gdiag is the diagonal subalgebra of g. the stress tensors and ground state conformal
weights of these orbifolds are worked out in ref. [1]. as conjectured in ref. [10], some of the
sectors of these orbifolds are kac-wakimoto coset constructions19,20.

generalizing the simplest examples (1.6), we will construct here a large class {h(, )}

of z-covariant subalgebras

{h(, )}  {h(z)},

h(1, {0}) = gdiag

in an action formulation of these theories, where one must learn to gauge these twisted
subalgebras.

2.1 notation

in what follows, we assume that g in (1.3) is simple. our notation for the currents of the
ambient algebra g is

jg(z) = {ja(i)(z)} = {ha(i)(z), e(i)(z)}

a = 1, ..., dimg,

i = 0, ...,   1,

a = 1, ..., rankg,

  (g)

(2.1a)

(2.1b)

where the index i labels the copies of g and the index a runs over a general basis of g. the
algebra of ane g

[ha(i)(m), hb(j)(n)] = ij k m abm+n,0

[ha(i)(m), e(j)(n)] = ij ae(i)(m + n)

n(, )e+,(i)(m + n)

i, j = 0, ...,   1,

(2.2d)

holds in the cartan-weyl basis of g.

the action of the automorphism group z(permutation) on ane g is

ja(i)

 = ij (h)ja(j),

ij(h) = i+,j mod   z(permutation)  aut(g)

(2.3a)

 = 0, ...,   1,

()  {1, ..., },

()



 {0, ...,   1}

(2.3b)

where () is the order of the element h  z(permutation).

2.2 the subalgebra h(, )  g

the subject of this subsection is the construction of a large class of z-covariant subalgebras
{h(z)}. the members of this class are labeled as h(, ),

g  h(, )  {h(z)},




 z+

(2.4)

where  is any positive integer that divides , and  is constructed for each choice of  as
follows. on the simple roots {i  (g)} of g, choose an integer-valued function (i) with
values in the range 0 to 

  1:

  {(i)} :

(i)  {0, ...,




 1},

i = 1, ..., rankg.

(2.5)

therefore at xed ,  and g we will construct

n(, , g) = (

(2.6)

less than or equal to x. a short calculation shows that er
 in (2.12) also satisfy

the algebra (2.11), which means that z(permutation) is in aut(h(, )). it follows that
each h(, ) is a z-covariant subalgebra of g.

 and h r


as an example of these subalgebrasb, consider the subalgebra h(1, {0}) for all g and ,

where {0} means (i) = 0, i. for this choice, one nds that

h r=0

e(i)(z)

(2.13a)

h( = 1;  = {0}) = gdiag

(2.13b)

so that the z-covariant subalgebra is the diagonal subalgebra of g. this is the h subalgebra
of the simple case in (1.6).

as another example consider the ambient algebra

g = 2

i=0 gi,

gi = g = su(2)

(2.14)

with simple root . this has a z-covariant subalgebra h( = 1, {() = 1}) whose currents

h r=0(z; ) = h(0)(z) + h(1)(z) + h(2)(z),
3 e(1)(z) + e 2i

 (z; ) = e(0)(z) + e 2i
er=0

(2.15b)

generate an ane su(2) at level 3k. here h(i) and e(i), i = 0, 1, 2 are the cartan
generator and root operators of su(2)i.

bthe trivial case h(, ) = g is not useful in the g/h coset constructions below.

coset orbifolds, these quantities always refer to g and ane g.

3 twisted currents

3.1 the ambient twisted algebra g()

in ref. [1], a general prescription is given to obtain the twisted ambient algebra of each
sector  of any orbifold a(h)/h. one begins with the action of the automorphisms on the
ambient currents jg

jg

 = (h)jg,

h  h  aut(g).

(3.1)

the matrix (h) denes an eigenvalue problem whose eigenvectors ug() generate the g
eigencurrents

(3.2)
with diagonal response to the automorphism (h). the twisted g currents jg(), which are
the ambient currents of each twisted sector ,

jg()  ug()jg

jg()  jg()

(3.3)

then satisfy the same opes as the eigencurrents. the diagonal monodromies of jg() are
controlled by the eigenvalues of (h).

in the case1 of the cyclic permutation orbifolds a(z)/z, the matrices (h) are given in
eq. (2.3), and one obtains the twisted g currents jg() of sector , which satisfy the orbifold
ane algebra g():

jg()(z) = { j (r)

here j, l label copies gj

(3.5)

where k is the level of the ane algebra (2.2). in what follows, g() is called the ambient
orbifold ane algebra of sector .

(g/h)

h



a(h)

h

h  g,

h  aut(g),

(3.6)

is to nd the twisted h currents with diagonal monodromy. the analysis of ref. [1] for the
ambient algebra g can also be applied, mutatis mutandis, to the h-covariant subalgebra h,
with attention to the embedding of ane h in ane g

jh = mjg

where m is the embedding matrix in the untwisted sector.

the induced action of the automorphism group h on the currents jh has the form

jh

 = ()jh

(3.7)

(3.8)

and the matrix () denes an induced eigenvalue problem whose eigenvectors uh() gen-
erate the h eigencurrents

jh()  uh()jh = uh()mjg = uh()mu 

g ()jg()

(3.9)

whose response to () is diagonal. the twisted h currents jh,

jh()  jh()

(3.10)

satisfy the opes of the h eigencurrents, with diagonal monodromies controlled by the
eigenvalues of (). moreover, with eqs. (3.3), (3.9) and (3.10), we see that jh is embedded
in the ambient twisted algebra as

jh()  m () jg(),

m ()  uh()mu 

g ()

(3.11)

where m () is the embedding matrix of sector .

the general twisted h currents jh are further discussed in subsec. 4.5, and appendix a

gives an application of this procedure to the simple case of the cyclic copy orbifolds.

(3.23d)

this form of h(, , ) is recognized as  = (, ) commuting copies of a doubly-twisted
current algebra11.

the doubly-twisted current algebras correspond to ane algebras which have been simul-
taneously twisted both by outer automorphisms z (permutations) and inner automorphisms
(d 6= 0) of g. equivalently, doubly-twisted current algebras are inner-automorphically twisted
orbifold ane algebras. the doubly-twisted algebras have an order (in this case /) and
a level (in this case k/), which are the order and level of the orbifold ane algebra10,11,1
before the inner-automorphic twist.

the origin of these algebras in this problem can be understood from eq. (3.22), which
shows that the induced automorphism  on jh is a combination of the permutation au-
tomorphism (r  r + ) and an inner automorphism (the phases).
in turn, the inner
automorphisms can be traced to the form (2.9a) of the root operators of the untwisted
subalgebra h(, )

(3.24c)

where e(j+r)

 is inner-automorphically equivalent to e(j+r).

in special cases, the doubly-twisted subalgebras reduce to singly-twisted subalgebras:

when the inner-automorphic vector d vanishes

d = 0   = {0}

(3.25)

then the subalgebras h(, 0, ) are orbifold ane algebras (see also subsec. 5.1). when d 6= 0,
 = 1 (and hence  = 1) the twisted subalgebras are inner-automorphically twisted2629
ane lie algebras on simple g (see also subsec. 5.4). when d 6= 0 and

(3.26)

the twisted subalgebras consist of  copies of inner-automorphically twisted ane g (see also
subsec. 5.5).

algebra. the explicit form of the embedding

follows from the discussion above.
it has been further observed in ref. [10] that outer-
automorphically twisted ane lie algebras30 also occur as subalgebras of orbifold ane
algebras. so the orbifold ane algebras contain (as subalgebras) examples of all standard
twisted current algebras.

it may also be possible to nd interacting cyclic coset orbifolds whose twisted h subalge-
bras are triply-twisted current algebras, which are twisted as well by outer automorphisms
of simple g.

we note that the ground state conformal weights in (4.9e) depend in general on the inner-

when the order  of a cyclic permutation orbifold is prime, every twisted sector  has
order () =  and so j = l = 0. moreover  = 1 so r = s = 0. as a result many of the

from (3.14) and (4.9). when  = {0}, these twisted h currents generate the subalgebras

4.4 the orbifold ane-sugawara constructions of h(, )/z

form

when written in terms of the twisted h currents jh(,,). this form shows that the stress
tensors th(,,) are nothing but the appropriate orbifold ane-sugawara constructions10 on
the twisted subalgebras h(, , ).

to understand this, recall that h(, ) is embedded in ane g at level 

 k and the ope
formc (3.15) of h(, , ) has orbifold ane order /. then the prefactor in (4.11) can be
computed via the map

(level of ane g)

from the prefactor of the orbifold ane-sugawara construction tg() in (4.8).

4.5 twisted (0,0) operators of the interacting coset orbifolds

the untwisted currents jh of a general coset construction g/h are (0,0) operators of tg/h,
and this situation applies in the untwisted sector of the general coset orbifold

(g/h)

h



a(h)

h

,

h  g,

h  aut(g),

h  aut(h).

(4.13)

then, the duality algorithm of ref. [1] tells us that the twisted h currents jh of a general
coset orbifold (see subsec. 3.2) are also twisted (0, 0) operators

tg/h(z)jh(w) = o((z  w)0)  t g/h

h

(z) jh(w; ) = o((z  w)0)

(4.14)

in the twisted sectors of the general coset orbifold. in what follows, we verify this explicitly
for our class of interacting cyclic coset orbifolds.

by explicit computation24,11 with the form (4.11) and the opes (3.15), we nd that

tg()(z) j r,(r)

a

(w; ; ) = th(,,)(z) j r,(r)
w

a

(w; ; )

= (

(z  w)2 +

z  w

) j r,(r)

a

(w; ; ) + o((z  w)0)

(4.15a)

calthough h(, , ) in (3.19) is not an orbifold ane algebra, it is the ope form of an algebra that

determines1 the virasoro constructions.

as expected, the currents of the h(, , ) subalgebra are twisted (1,0) operators of tg()

(4.16b)

in each sector of the interacting cyclic coset orbifolds.

in an action formulation of coset orbifolds, one must learn to gauge these twisted h
subalgebras. the twisted (0,0) operators of the cyclic coset copy orbifolds are discussed in
app. a.

5 examples

the components for g/z in (4.8) and h(, )/z in (4.9) and (4.11) are now easily assembled
into the stress tensors and ground state conformal weights of the twisted sectors

form (4.11) for th(,,) in terms of the twisted h currents, while the alternate form of
th(,,) in (4.9) is used in appendix c to write the coset stress tensors entirely in terms of
the inverse inertia tensors l and l and the ambient algebras g and g().

18

for the rst three examples, we return to the general basis

in this case the conformal weights are those of tg() in (4.8) because the integral ane

appendix a.

(0,0) operators in cyclic coset copy orbifolds

in this appendix, we nd the twisted (0,0) operators (which are the twisted h currents) in
the simpler case of the cyclic coset copy orbifolds14,15,10,16,11,1,17,18

1

i=0 (g/h)i/z.

(a.1)

the stress tensors in the untwisted sectors of these orbifolds are sums of  commuting copies
of the coset construction g/h, h  g. the lie algebras involved here are

g = 1

i=0 gi,

gi = g;

h = 1

i=0 hi,

hi = h  g

(a.2)

and the ambient ane algebra is still given by (2.2). the embedding of the untwisted h
currents ja(i) in the untwisted g currents ja(i) is

ja(i)(z) = m a

a ja(i)(z)

a = 1, ..., dimh,

a = 1, ..., dimg,

i = 0, ...,   1

(a.3a)

(a.3b)

where m a

a is the embedding matrix of h  g.

in this case, the induced action  of z(permutation) on the untwisted h currents

ja(i)(z)  = ij (h)ja(j)(z) = ja(i+)(z),

(h) = (h),

 = 0, ...,   1

(a.4)

is the same as the action  in eq. (2.3) on the g currents. this follows because the embedding
matrix m a
a does not mix values of the index i. then the duality transformations of ref. [1]
tell us that the twisted h currents j (r)
a(j) are the same linear combinationsd of the currents of

dthat is, m () = m in the language of subsec. 3.2.

where r is the index of embedding of h in g. the twisted h currents j (r)
a(j) in (a.5a) are
twisted (1,0) operators of both stress tensors tg() and th(), and so they are twisted (0,0)
operators in each sector of each cyclic coset copy orbifold.
