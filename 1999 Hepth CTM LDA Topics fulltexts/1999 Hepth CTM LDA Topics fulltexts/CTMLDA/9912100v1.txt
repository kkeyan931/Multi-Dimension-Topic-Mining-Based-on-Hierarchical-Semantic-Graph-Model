abstract

we study the mass and dierent rr charge distributions of the bps (p,p-2)-brane

bound states in the closed string brane-like -model. we show that such brane bound

states can be realized by introducing a constant b eld in the closed string theory. in

addition we show that the worldvolume coordinates of these brane bound states turn

out to be noncommutative.

introduction

it is believed that d-branes play a crucial role in the dynamics of type ii string theories

at strong couplings. in the usual treatment, d-branes are described perturbatively by open

strings satisfying dirichlet boundary conditions for the transverse directions [1]. in an alter-

native approach the non-perturbative dynamics of d-branes in string theory is described in

terms of exotic massless vertex operators, brane-like states. in the open string sector these

operators are described by two form and ve form brst invariant vertices[2]:

vmn = h e2mn
m1...m5 = h e3m1..m5
v (3)

dz
2i

dz
2i ,

(1)

where m are ten dimensional nsr worldsheet fermions and  is bosonized superconformal
ghost eld. the remarkable property of these vertex operators is that they exist at non-zero

ghost pictures only. these vertex operators also appear as central two form and ve form

terms in the picture changed space-time superalgebra in the nsr string theory, i.e. due to

the no-go theorem they should be related to the dynamics of extended objects, such as d-

branes. in the closed string sector the corresponding brst invariant propagating brane-like

vertices are given by[3]:

v2(k) = e(k)r d2ze2a x aeik x 

v5(p) = 5(p)a1..a4 r d2ze3a1..a4 t

x teipax a

.

(2)

the space-time indices in the v2 vertex are split in the (2 + 8) way, ,  = 0, 1, a = 2...9,
whereas in the v5 in the (4 + 6), a1, ..., a4 = 0, 1, 2, 3 t = 4...9. it is crucial that the brst
invariance condition connes the propagation of these vertices to two and four longitudinal

dimensions for v2 and v5 respectively. moreover the condition of worldsheet conformal
invariance restricts the momentum dependence of the four dimensional 5 eld as:

5(p) =

0
p4

,

(3)

where 0 is some constant presumably related to mass or rr charge of the d3-brane. it is
shown that the nsr sigma model with the v5 vertex in at space-time is equivalent to gs
superstring theory in the background of the d3-brane, namely the ads5  s5 [5], and repro-
duces the correlation functions of the large n n = 4, d = 4 sym theory[4]. the v5 vertex
is therefore presumed to play an important geometrical role, accounting for, in particular,

2

the dynamical compactication of the at ten dimensional space-time to another maximally
supersymmetric ads5s5 vacuum. in the formula (2) the longitudinal 4-dimensional indices
of the v5 operator correspond to the worldvolume of d3-brane or the boundary of ads5.

apart from individual branes one can realize the non-marginal bound states of the branes,

i.e. bound states of p, p-2, p-4, ...-branes or bound states of d-branes with fundamental

strings. in the open string theory language these bound states can be introduced by the

open strings with mixed boundary conditions at the ends parallel to branes and dirichlet

boundary conditions for the transverse coordinates [6, 7]:

g(  )x  + b( + )x |z=z = 0 ,  = 0, ..., p

(4)

( + )x  = 0  = p + 1, .., 9.




the electric mixing, b0i 6= 0, leads to brane-string bound state while the magnetic mixing,
6= 0, produces the brane-brane bound states. quantizing the open strings with the
bij
above boundary conditions reveals the noncommutative structure of the brane worldvolume

coordinates [8, 9].

in this paper we will study the closed string -model with the v5 brane-like state in the
presence of constant non-zero b eld. in the section 2, we will show that the mass density

of the d3-brane in the presence of the b eld is reproduced by the scattering amplitude

(correlation function) of two v5 operators (that describe the d3-brane dynamics), which is
in exact agreement with the well-known results.
in order to elucidate the corresponding

d3-d1 bound state, we analyze the scattering of rr elds in the above mentioned -model.
we nd that the structure of the relevant four point correlation functions, < v5v5v p
rr >,
shows that our -model has the correct rr charge distributions of the corresponding d3-
d1 bound state. in the section 3, studying the two point x a x b correlation functions in

rrv p

the above closed string -model, we show that the noncommutative structure of the brane

bound state worldvolume appears just like in the open string case. namely, we will argue

that the regularization of the closed sting amplitudes with the v5 insertions leads to the
well-known open string propagators in the presence of b eld, however this result appears

to be regularization dependent. in the concluding section we discuss possible connections

between brane like -models, and ncsym theories and the related interesting questions.

2 brane bound states and brane-like states

in this section we study the partition function of the closed string theory with inserted v5
state and constant b eld:

z[5, b] = z dxer g x  x  +b x  x  +5 v5+5 v5

(5)

in order to explore the resulting brane structure we study the partition function perturba-

tively in 0 and b eld.

z =



xn=0

1
n!

< v5v5v n

b > +o(3),

(6)

where vb = b x  x  and we use the usual opes for closed strings. the rst non-trivial
contribution to the above sum comes from v 2

b, which in the proper ghost picture is

< v5v5vbvb >= r d4k 2
e3 a1 ..a4 t2

k4 a1..a4b1..b4bi1j1bi2j2 < e a1 ..a4 t1

t2 eikax a(z2, z2)x i1 x j1(z3, z3)x i2 x j2(z4, z4) > .

x t1eikax a(z1, z1)

(7)

since the b eld polarization is parallel to the brane and it is an antisymmetric tensor,

there are no contractions between the v5 and vb operators and hence we can easily nd the
above correlation function

< v5v5vbvb >= 2

0det(g)t r(b2),

(8)

and for the same reason we can nd all the contributions to (6). summing up all of those

terms, up to second order in 0 we nd

z[5, b] = z[5, b = 0] det(g+b)

detg

= z[5r det(g+b)

detg

, b = 0].

(9)

as we discussed in the introduction 5 shows the rr charge and hence the mass density
of the bps d3-brane. in the same manner the (2) shows that upon introducing the b eld,
the bps mass density of the related extended object is given by, d3  mass qdet(g + b).
since the constant b eld term in the (5) is quadratic in xs, the above calculations

can be understood and performed by replacing gij by gij + bij in the usual closed string
propagators (both in bosonic and fermionic parts), i.e.

: xi(z1)xj(z2) : |b = (gij + bij)log|z1  z2|.

(10)

4

hence z =< v5v5 > |b + o(3), which clearly reproduces the above results.

to show that turning on the b-eld in the brane-like -model (5) leads to the bound

d3-d1 state, one has to study the scattering of probe rr-elds o the v5-state (which
corresponds to d3-brane in our model) in the presence of the b-term. the bound d3-

d1 state (its appearance is the eect of switching on the b-eld) manifests itself through

the presence of the appropriate ramond-ramond charge distributions in the system. the

relevant correlation function is given by:

the upper indices in brackets refer to the left and right ghost numbers of vertex operators,

 are space-time spin operators, the momenta k1, k2 of the v5-vertices are four-dimensional
(polarized along the 0,1,2,3 longitudinal directions), while the momenta of the 3-form and

5-form rr-vertices are ten-dimensional. the presence of the constant b-eld results in the

modication of the o.p.e. between spin elds and fermions. first of all, the two-point

function of the longitudinal worldsheet fermions (parallel to the d3-brane worldvolume) is

given by:

< a(z)b(w) >=

(12)

while the correlators of the transverse fermions are unchanged. for simplicity, we will con-

sider the b-eld with the only non-vanishing b23 component elsewhere in this paper. per-
forming the usual construction of space-time spinors out of worldsheet fermions with taking

into account the modication related to the b-eld, we nd that the relevant modied

finally, putting together all the pieces of the correlator av5rr(z1, z1, ...z4, z4), xing the
sl(2,c) remnant conformal symmetry by setting z2  1, z3  0, z4   and integrating
over z1 with the appropriate koba-nielsens measure, we obtain the following expression for
the scattering amplitude:




av5rr(k1, k2, p1, p2) = r d2z1|z2  z3|2|z2  z4|2|z3  z4|2av5rr(z1, z1, ...z4, z4)

(19)

r d2z1|1  z1|2({k1k2}+2)|z1|2{k1p1}

it is remarkable that, after xing the global sl(2,c) conformal invariance the only terms

that survive in the amplitude are those linear in b23 (in the kinematic factor). all the
contributions to the kinematic factor which are non-linear in the b-eld, go away as we take
the limit z4  . performing the integration over z1, we get:

av5rr(k1, k2, p1, p2) = 35(k1)5(k2)fm1...m5(p1)fn1...n3(p2)

(t r(cn1...n3mm1...m5)(p1)m + t r(cn1...n323mm1...m5)b23)

this expression has yet to be integrated over the four-dimensional momenta k1 and k2 of the
v5-vertices. the integration similar to the one done in [4], taking into account the momentum
conservation p2 = p1  k1  k2 along with the condition (3), gives:

a = r d4k1r d4k2av5rr(k1, k2, p1, p2) = 3(0)2fm1...m5(p1)fn1...n3(p2)

(21)

where p||
1 is the projection of the ten-dimensional momentum of the rr-vertex to the four
longitudinal dimensions, and we have skipped the contributions analytic in p||
1 (which do not
play any role upon the fourier transformation back to the position space). finally, taking

traces of the gamma-matrices, we nd that the amplitude is proportional to:

a  2

0f0123tf 01tb23

(22)

corresponding to the attraction force between the d3-brane and d-string in the d3  d1

bound state.

analogously, one can consider turning on the b01 component of the b-eld, along with
b23. in this case,the eect of the b-eld in the d3-brane worldvolume will result in appear-
ance of the d-instanton-d-string-d3-brane bound state, in addition to the d1-d3 one. the
related string-theoretic v rrv5 scattering amplitude will be quadratic in the b-eld, being
proportional to a  2
0ftf 0123tb01b23, where ft is the rr eld strength, corresponding
to the d-instanton. analogously, one can observe the appearance of other various d-brane

bound states as a result of switching on the b-eld , in the context of the brane-like -model.

3 noncommutativity from closed string -model

in this section we will consider the propagators of two bosonic closed string x elds in the

presence of the b eld and the v5 operator. the correlation function of interest is given by

< x a(z1) x b(z2) > |b,v5.

as it follows from the -model action (5) that the rst non-trivial contribution to this
correlator (of order of 2

5) is proportional to

< x a(z1) x b(z2) > |b,v5  2

< x m(z1) x n(z2)v (1,0)

5

the integration over k is proportional to  r d4k

regularization. the above correlation function is then given by

k4 kakb which gives gab after the appropriate

let us consider the rst integral given by

i(z1, z2) = z d2w1d2w2

|w1  w2|4

(z1  w1)(z2  w1)

.

(25)

writing w1 = x + iy, we have

i(z1, z2) = z d2w2 z 



dyz 



dx

(x + iy  w2)2(x + iy  w2)2(z1  x  iy)(z2  x + iy)

.

(26)
for the sake of certainty let us consider the case im(z1), im(z2)  0, so that both of z1 and
z2 are in the upper half plane. now in order to elucidate the open string structure of the
propagator we propose to consider not all the poles in the above integral, but only those

located in the upper half plane and then to retain only the terms surviving the translational

invariance along the x axis. evaluating residues of those poles in x and then in y we nd

i(z1, z2) = 2z1z2 z d2w

1

(z1  w2)(z2  w2)

.

(27)

our procedure for distinguishing the upper half plane poles contains few subtleties; see

below for more explicit explanation. again we can perform the w2 integration by writing it
as w2 = u + iv, so that the integral can be written as

i(z1, z2) = 2z1z2 z 



dvz 



du

1

(z1  u  iv)(z2  u + iv)

.

(28)

the essential point in our computation is that we only take into account the poles located

in the upper half plane (this may be achieved e.g. by including the exponential factor
 eix,  > 0 in the complex integral over x and taking the limit   0 afterwards).

i(z1, z2) = 2z1z2 z 

0

dv

1

(z2  z1 + 2iv)

.

(29)

now we shall stress that in the integration over v, the integration must be taken from zero
to , rather than from  to , in order to exclude the terms breaking the translational

invariance in the direction of the real axis. finally, regularizing the above integral and

dierentiating over z1 and z2 we nd

i(z1, z2) =

1

(z1  z2)2

.

(30)

the corresponding contribution to the x x propagator is given by

(g + b)g1(g + b)log(z1  z2)

9

. adding the necessary complex conjugate part coming from

< x a(z1)x b(z2) > |b,v5 = (g  b)g1(g  b)

1

(z1  z2)2

,

we get the corresponding part of the x x propagator:

(cid:18)(g + b)g1(g + b)(cid:19)s

log|z1  z2|2 + (cid:18)(g + b)g1(g + b)(cid:19)a

log

z1  z2
z1  z2

(31)

where the s, a show the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of that matrix. to nd the full

expression for the propagator we also have to take into account the contributions coming from
< x a(z1)x b(z2) > |b,v5 and < x a(z1) x b(z2) > |b,v5. adding all of these contributions
together up to second order in 2

0 we have

< x a(z1) x b(z2) > gab(log|z1  z2|  log|z1  z2|)

(32)

(gab + ab)log(z1  z2)  (gab  ab)log(z1  z2),

where g and  are the the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of (g + b)1
ab . this is in
agreement with the expression for open string x x propagator in the constant b eld back-

ground giving rise to the noncommutative structure of the brane worldvolume coordinates

[10].

4 discussions and remarks

in this paper we have studied the adding of a constant b eld background to the closed string

brane-like -model. we argued that since the b term is quadratic in x and only contains

the parallel x components, the contractions between vb and brane-like states vanish and
therefore the constant b eld eects can be totally absorbed in the closed string propagators.

calculating the mass density and dierent rr charge densities we have shown that turning

on the b eld in the brane-like -model gives rise to the non-marginal d3-d1 bound state.

in addition we have shown that the closed string propagators in the presence of b eld reveal

the noncommutativity of the brane coordinates. all the above results can be checked and

claried in the brane-brane scattering processes [6, 7]. in order to study such scatterings we
should be able to identify the location of dp-brane in the 9  p dimensional transverse space.
this can be done by adding a delta function of the brane location, y t, to the v5 state:

v5(k||, kt) = (

0
k4
||

)a1..a4 z d2ze3a1 ..a4 t x teik||x||

eikt(x ty t).

10

we should note that adding such a term will not destroy the superconformal and the brst

invariance.

as it has been argued in [3, 4], adding the brane-like states to the closed strings in the

at background leads to strings eectively living in the related supergravity backgrounds,
namely ads5  s5. so we expect that the same ideology should work for the case we
have at hand, the brane bound states. however, in the presence of the b eld, the related

supergravity solution is not ads anymore. it has been argued in [11, 12] that one can nd

a limit in which the corresponding ncsym theory (described in terms of properly scaled

parameters) decouples from the bulk gravity. so it seems that we should be able to build

some more concrete relations between string theory in the above mentioned brane bound

state backgrounds and the deformed gauge theories on the boundary. in particular one can
nd the four point function of ncsym theory, < f 2
n c > from the dilaton scattering o
these bound states.

n cf 2

the more interesting question we can address here is the wilson loops. since it is believed
that the v5 operator (accounting for dynamical compactication ads5  s5) compensates for
the zig-zag non-invariance of the gravity part and since the b term is zig-zag invariant, wilson

loops of the ncsym theory calculated by means of the gravity/ncsym correspondence

should be zig-zag invariant.

it is well-known that the conformal invariance should be broken in the conning phase.

in the gauge theory language that means that we are just living apart from the uv xed

point. from the string theory point of view breaking the conformal symmetry in the four di-

mensional space-time usually corresponds to turning on the gravity in transverse dimensions

(e.g. the radial coordinate of ads5) [13]. however the presence of the transverse graviton
modes is expected to break the zig-zag symmetry, necessary to relate the string theory with

the gauge-theoretic large n limit. the alternative approach, which preserves the zig-zag

symmetry, is based on including the axionic b term to the functional for the wilson loop.

in this case one can expect this functional both to obey the large n loop equation and to

exhibit the area law behaviour, necessary for the connement.
