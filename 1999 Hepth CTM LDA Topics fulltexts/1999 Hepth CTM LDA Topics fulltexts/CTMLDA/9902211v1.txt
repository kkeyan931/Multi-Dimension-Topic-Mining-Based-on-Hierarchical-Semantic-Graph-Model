continuing the investigation of cnm (chiral-nonminimal) hypermultiplet
nonlinear -models, we propose extensions of the concept of the c-map which
relate holomorphic functions to hyper-kahler geometries.
in particular, we
show that a whole series of hyper-kahler potentials can be derived by replacing
the role of the 4d, n = 1 tensor multiplet in the original c-map by 4d, n = 1
non-minimal multiplets and auxiliary superelds. the resulting n = 2 models
appear to have interesting connections to calabi-yau manifolds and algebraic
varieties. these models also emphasize the fact that special hyper-kahler
manifolds (the analogs of special kahler manifolds) without isometries exist.

1 introduction

the study of supersymmetrical nonlinear -models has proven repeatedly to provide a
way in which to derive new results in complex manifold theories with potentials. one such
example of this is provided by the c-map, known for approximately a decade due to a
work of cecotti, ferrara and girardello [1]. according to the glossary in [2] the c-map
is a method for constructing the hypermultiplet moduli space of a type-ii string theory
compactied on a calabi-yau three-fold from the vector multiplet moduli space of the
other type-ii theory on the same three-fold. in rigid supersymmetry, with which we only
concern ourselves in this paper, the c-map sends a special kahler manifold of the rigid
type md to a hyper-kahler manifold h2d (with both subscripts denoting the complex
dimensions) [1]. one feature that arose due to the method of construction utilized is
that the resultant hyper-kahler metrics always possess a set of isometries. so clearly this
construction leads to a restricted class of hyper-kahler geometries. this naturally raises
the question of whether there exist generalizations of the c-map that lead to a wider class
of hyper-kahler geometries.

recently, we began an eort to investigate the structure of 4d, n = 2 nonlinear -
models which have the property that the n = 2 supersymmetry is manifest [3] by use of
projective superspace. projective superspace techniques made their rst appearance in
the literature via the work in [4] but received their most complete development in the later
works of [5, 6]. one implication of our completed investigation is that essentiallyall 4 4d,
n = 1 supersymmetric nonlinear -models possess 4d, n = 2 supersymmetric extensions.
it is thus natural that we turn our attention to the question of whether the projective
approach can be used to gain more insight into the issue of generalizations to the c-map.
in this work we will present results from this eort. we begin by looking at the classical
c-map [1] and presenting a streamlined proof as compared to the original one. here, using
projective superspace allows the discovery of a simple reason why the original c-map
necessarily relates a holomorphic function to a hyper-kahler metric. we next observe
that the original c-map is related to a particular projective multiplet representation,
the projective o(2)-multiplet. this is followed with the observation that the role of
the projective o(2)-multiplet is not unique and with a simple generalization, projective
o(2n)-multiplets and nally the projective polar multiplet may be used instead.

the structure of our proposed generalizations to the c-map suggest interesting con-

4there is a mild restriction that in order to possess an n = 2 extension, the kahler potential dening

the n = 1 nonlinear -model must be an analytic function.

nections to issues in algebraic geometry. in particular the models which emerge from this
approach have the structure of being theories that are dened on hypersurfaces in kahler
spaces. these surfaces are dened by holomorphic constraints. an interesting case for
the polar multiplets occurs when these holomorphic constraints are polynomial in nature.

2 the aboriginal c-map

the work of [1] started with a holomorphic prepotential5 f () dening the kahler

potential k(, ) for a special kahler geometry with metric gi j(, )

k(i , j ) = i fi() + i fi( )

,

gi j(, ) = fij () + fij ( )

.

(2.1)

next, the following extension of the kahler potential was introduced

h(, , , ) = k(, ) + 1

2 gi j(, )(i + i)(j + j )

.

(2.2)

in (2.1) and (2.2) the quantities i , as usual, are chiral superelds that have the geo-
metrical interpretation of being the coordinates of the complex manifold whose metric
in given by gi j.
in (2.2) the quantities i are also chiral superelds. however, their
geometrical interpretation is very dierent. since these appear in the expression multi-
plying the inverse kahler metric, it follows that i must be co-vectors associated with
the kahler manifold. after considerable eort it was shown that h(, , , ) denes a
hyper-kahler geometry. at this stage, we see that the c-map also has the interpretation
of providing a mechanism for dening hyper-kahler geometries in terms of a purely holo-
morphic function f (). according to a well-known theorem regarding supersymmetric
non-linear -models, all such 4d, n = 2 (or 2d, n = 4) supersymmetric models describe
hyper-kahler geometries. an apparent feature of (2.2) is that it is necessarily invariant
under the change of variables i  i + iai, if ai are a set of real quantities. this is
equivalent to the appearance of a set of isometries of the hyper-kahler metric. so it is an
intrinsic feature of the c-map (as described above) to entail a procedure in which some
hyper-kahler manifolds that necessarily contain isometries are constructed from a single
holomorphic function.

the proof given in [1] that the potential (2.2) describes a hyper-kahler geometry is
quite involved. below we will give an alternate and much more transparent proof of
this, taking advantage of the fact that any nonlinear 4d -model that realizes n = 2

5here we use this term to refer to its more recent denition, not its original one [7].

supersymmetry necessarily describes a hyper-kahler geometry. a set of d n = 2 tensor
multiplets is described in n = 1 superspace by d chiral superelds i and d real linear
superelds gi.

a way to make manifest n = 2 supersymmetry is to use the projective superspace
techniques [5] which, in turn, naturally emerge from the fundamental concept of harmonic
superspace [8]. in this approach to n = 2 supersymmetric theories, a whole sequence of
scalar multiplets, known as o(2n) projective multiplets [5, 6] has been found. the case
of the o(2) projective multiplet is directly relevant to the n = 2 tensor multiplet. the
quantity dened by

i(w) = i + wgi  w2 i

,

i = 1, . . . , d ,

(2.3)

is an o(2) projective multiplet and is allowed to enter a projective n = 2 supersymmetric
action of the form

s =

1

2 i ic

dw

w z d8z l(i(w), w)

,

(2.4)

where the lagrangian may be specied to the form

s = 

1

2 i ic

dw

w z d8z

f (i(w))

w2

+ h.c.

,

(2.5)

in terms of a single holomorphic function f . a simple calculation gives

f (i(w)) = f(cid:16)i + wgi  w2 i(cid:17)

therefore, the action is equivalent to

= f () + wfi()gi  w2(cid:16)fi() i  1
s[, , g] = z d8z n k(, )  1

2gi j (, ) gigj o .

2fij () gigj(cid:17) + o(w3)

.

(2.6)

the real linear superelds gi can be dualized (using an n = 1 supereld duality trans-
formation) into pairs of (anti)chiral ones, i and i. as a result, the action turns into

s[, , , ] = z d8z h(, , , )

,

(2.7)

with h(, , , ) given precisely as in (2.2). a special feature of the potential (2.2) is
that the (anti) chiral superelds  and  cannot be converted into complex (anti)linear
ones  and !

we thus see in eqs. (2.32.7) a simple and straightforward proof of the existence of the
c-map with the consequence that the potential (2.2) describes a hyper-kahler geometry.

4

3 construction of new o(2n) c-maps

as noted below eq. (2.7), the hyper-kahler geometry there described cannot be ob-
tained from our previous discussion of cnm-hypermultiplet models [3]. the technical
reason for this is because of the impossibility to perform an n = 1 supereld duality
transformation from chiral to complex linear superelds whenever the chiral superelds
appear in an action solely via the linear combination i + i and cnm models necessarily
involve complex linear multiplets. this leaves two options:

 it is impossible to eliminate all the auxiliary superelds in the

cnm-hypermultiplet models appropriate for the case at hand;

 if it is possible to eliminate all the auxiliary superelds in the
cnm-hypermultiplet models for kahler potential of the form (2.1),
we apparently arrive at a dierent hyper-kahler manifold as com-
pared to that dened by (2.2). this implies the c-map is not
unique, at least in the case of rigid susy.

let us repeat the above considerations for the case of o(4) projective superspace

multiplet (instead of the tensor multiplet). the basic superelds read

i (w) = i + wi + w2v i  w3i + w4 i

,

v i = v i

,

(3.1)

where i are chiral, i complex linear, v i real unconstrained superelds. instead of the
action (2.5), we now have

so(4) =

w z d8z

f (i(w))

(3.2)

or, after performing the contour integral,

2h fij k() j k + fij k( ) j k i v i

the auxiliary superelds v i can be easily eliminated via

v l =  1

2 gi l(, )h fij k() j k + fij k( ) j k i

,

(3.4)

5

which can be used to re-write the action totally in terms of the chiral and complex linear
superelds. then, the action will include terms of the second- and fourth-order in  and
. we explicitly nd that the removal of the auxiliary superelds yields,

s[, , , ] = z d8z n k(, )  gi j(, ) i j
4 fm j k() gm n fn rs( ) j k r s
4!fij kl ij kl + 1

4!

fij kl i j k l o ,

fij kl  fij kl  3 fijm gm n f kln .

(3.5)

we emphasize that this action despite its relative simplicity and written in terms of
n = 1 superelds actually possesses n = 2 supersymmetry. this is directly analogous to
the original n = 1 supereld introduction of the n = 2 supersymmetric kahlerian vector
multiplet (kvm) model [9].

to obtain the hyper-kahler potential, we have to dualize the (anti)linear scalars , 
into (anti)chiral ones , . this amounts to implementing an n = 1 supereld legendre
transform of  and  in the action (3.5) by writing the master action

s [, , w, w , , ] = s[, , w, w ] + z d8z [ w i i + w i i ]

,

(3.6)

and then to determine the unconstrained complex superelds w and w in terms of 
and  by solving their equations of motion

s 
w i = 0  i +


w i l(, , w, w ) = 0 ,

(3.7)

where l(, , , ) is the lagrangian in (3.5). since the kahler metric gi j (, ) is non-
singular and taking into account the explicit structure of l(, , , ), the above equa-
tions (3.7) are solved uniquely in a small neighborhood of the origin in w -space. globally,
the equations (3.7) are solved exactly although not uniquely, see below. the hyper-kahler
structure thus derived does not possess abelian isometries, in contrast to (2.2), obtained
via the original c-map.

one of the interesting features of the o(2n) (for n  2) projective multiplets, in
contrast to the o(2) projective multiplet, is that they can be coupled to yang-mills mul-
tiplets. the exception in the case of the o(2) projective multiplet is due to the fact
that only the o(2) multiplet contains a component level 2-form gauge eld. however,
the o(2n) (for n  2) projective multiplets can only provide representations of matter
that are real representations of the yang-mills gauge group. this condition arises due

6

to the reality of the supereld that occurs as the coecient of the wn-term in the o(2n)
projective multiplet. since the action (3.5) depends on the holomorphic function f , it
is interesting to conjecture that the o(4) projective -model can be combined with the
supereld kahlerian vector multiplet model [9] by identifying the two a priori indepen-
dent holomorphic functions as one and the same. this seems logical as a step toward the
construction of hyper-kahlerian vector multiplet (hkvm) models. in the limit where
f = 1
22 and with a modication of the linearity condition, the combined kvm action
and projective o(4) -model (3.5) describes the n = 4 yang-mills model. it is a topic for
additional study to see if this n = 4 supersymmetry continues to exist with more general
choices of f such as the seiberg-witten prepotential [10].

there is an obvious generalization to the results in (3.1) and (3.5). consider the

general o(2n) multiplet of the form

i(w) = i + w i +

wu i

1 + wn v i

n1

x=2

+ (1)n(n1

(3.8)

where  is a chiral supereld,  is a complex linear supereld, v i is an arbitrary real
general supereld and the remaining 4d, n = 1 superelds u in (3.8) are complex general
ones. we consider the action of the form

so(2n) = (1)n 1

2 i ic

dw

w z d8z

f (i(w))

w2n

+ h.c.

.

(3.9)

this obviously leads to a generalization of (3.2) and it includes a term of the form

(1)n 1

2 gi j (, ) v i v j

(3.10)

where the supereld v i is the real n = 1 coecient supereld of the wn term in the o(2n)
multiplet i(w). the only other manner in which this supereld appears in (3.9) is via a
term that is linear in v i. that is why v i can always be explicitly and uniquely removed
by its algebraic equation of motion. clearly, there are lots of other terms involving the
other complex superelds u i
for  = 1, ..., n  2. for the full
theory we have

 and their conjugates u i



so(2n)[, , u, v ] = z d8z h k(, )  gi j(, )i j + p(u, u, v ; , , , )

where the kahler potential and metric are determined as in (2.1) in terms of the holomor-
phic prepotential in (3.9). the same holomorphic prepotential f in (3.9) also determines
the function p being a multinomial in u, u and v with the coecients depending
polynomially on ,  and functionally on ,  such that

p(u, u , v ; , , , )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)u = u=v =0

p(u, u, v ; , , , ) = (1)gi j(, )

(3.13)

as is already clear from (3.13), for n > 2 we face the problem of eliminating the
auxiliary superelds. of course, one can develop a perturbation theory to solve the
equations of motion for u, u and v :

p =

(3.14)

by representing f () = f0 + f , where f0 = 1
22 represents the leading contribution to
f () and f = o(3) corresponds to a small perturbation. however, explicit solutions
to equations (3.14) can be found only for special choices of f (). in general, eqs. (3.14)
present an algebro-geometric problem, and we return to this below.

suce it here to recall that the coordinate and the vector superelds ,  parametrize
the total space of the tangent bundle, tm, over the manifold of special kahler geometry
whose metric is determined by the holomorphic function f . the auxiliary superelds
u, v, u enlarge this space considerably. the (2n  3) d constraint equations (3.14), for
n  2, then locate tm as an algebraic variety within the enlarged eld space.

for a general holomorphic prepotential f (), the o(2n) multiplets themselves, i (3.8),

possess a z2n symmetry dened as follows:

i (w)  i(eiw)

,

(ei)2n = 1 .

(3.15)

8

here the restriction exp(2ni ) = 1 follows from the twisted reality condition (5.2) to
which the projective superelds i(w) are subject. it is the requirement of z2n symmetry
which forbids us to add terms of the form

f (i(w))

wk

,

k 6= 0

(mod 2n)

,

(3.16)

to the lagrangian in (3.9).

it should be stressed that for the o(2) model we have not only the discrete z2 sym-
metry, but also d abelian noncompact isometries (peccei-quinn symmetry) in addition.
the point is the o(2) action in (2.6) is invariant under shifts

gi(z)  gi(z) + ai

,

i = 1, . . . , d ,

(3.17)

with the as being arbitrary real constants. such isometries are characteristic of the o(2)
model only and they cannot be present for the general o(2n) projective models with
n > 1.

4 construction of the minimal polar multiplet

c-map

in our previous work [3], we discussed6 the existence of 4d, n = 2 nonlinear -models

based on the use of the polar representation [11] of projective superspace



i(w) =

i

n(z)wn = i (z) + wi(z) + o(w2)

,

 [ i + iw + ai(w) ]

,

 i(w) =

w

 i(z) + o(( 1

w )2)

,

xn=0



xn=0

 [  i   i 1

w + a i(w) ]

.

(4.1)

the polar multiplet is in a sense the n =  limit of the o(2n) projective multiplets. it
is distinguished from them because, as mentioned in [3], the polar multiplet realizes a
certain u(1) symmetry that cannot occur in the o(2n) projective multiplets. we have

6our notational conventions in this section are those in [3].

to describe a 4d, n = 2 nonlinear -model. there was nothing in our previous discussion
that prevents the kahler potential (4.2) from taking the form given in (2.1). since the
potential has a special form, it follows that

s[, ] = z d8zn 1

(4.3)

so at least formally, it is possible to utilize the polar multiplet to dene a c-map that
connects a solely holomorphic function f to a 4d, n = 2 supersymmetric nonlinear -
model and therefore a hyper-kahler model. the action (4.3) can be shown to look similar
to that in (3.11), with the dierences that (i) the real auxiliary supereld v is absent;
(ii) the set of complex auxiliary superelds u includes innitely many representatives,
 = 1, 2, . . . , ; (iii) the function p(, , u, u) becomes transcendental.

a specic feature of the model (4.2) and its special version (4.3) we note, is a rigid

u(1) symmetry dened by

i(w)  i(eiw) .

(4.4)

this symmetry can be treated as a formal limit, u(1) = limnz2n, of the discrete
symmetry (3.15) in the o(2n) multiplet model. since the models (3.9) and (4.2) possess
dierent symmetries, it is natural to expect that these models lead to dierent hyper-
kahler structures.

we would be remiss if we did not mention that this form of the polar multiplet, since
it depends also only on the holomorphic function f , can be combined with the kvm
action [9] by identifying the two holomorphic functions to oer a second possible starting
point for the construction of a hyper-kahlerian vector multiplet (hkvm) action. it also
worthwhile to note that such a hkvm model might play a role for the eective action of
n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory just as the kvm model plays the critical role
of encoding the eective action of n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory.

10

5 discussion

the models discussed in this note appear to be avatars for a number of interesting
phenomena, most of which follow from the nice structure of projective superspace [5]. we
now discuss some of them in turn.

5.1 some general field-space issues

all the n = 2 multiplets considered in this note take the form of an order-2n polyno-
mial in the complex variable w with (eectively) n = 1 supereld coecients (suppressing
the i superscripts):

(w) =

wkk

.

2n

xk=0

(5.1)

the terminal superelds in the series, 0, 2n, are chiral and antichiral, respectively,
and the adjacent ones, 1, 2n1 are complex (anti)linear superelds. in addition, all but
the n   limit of (5.1) are required to satisfy the twisted reality condition

(w) = (w)

,

(w) def= (1)nw2n

(

1
w

2n

xk=0

)k k

.

(5.2)

this forces the middle supereld, n to be real, and so for n = 1, 1 is a real , not
complex, linear supereld.

the rst superelds 0 = , are identied as the coordinate superelds since their
lowest components map the 4d spacetime into the target manifold md and serve as local
coordinates. the next superelds, 1 = , may be identied with tangent vectors (much
as the fermions within the coordinate chiral superelds  are), so that the pair , 
provides a local (super)coordinate chart for the total space of the holomorphic (real in
the n = 1 case) tangent space tm. the interpretation that complex linear superelds most
naturally are associated with kahler manifold tangent vectors was rst given in [12] and
provided a solution to the puzzling fact that the component form of nonlinear -models
dened in terms of  possess [13] a very dierent form from those dened in terms of .

the remaining 2n3 superelds k, k = 2, . . . , 2n2 are auxiliary, since their equa-
tions of motion (3.14) are purely algebraic. generally (and for n > 1), their geomet-
rical interpretation is as follows. the total space, y , coordinatized by 0, . . . , 2n en-
larges tm considerably by the introduction of the 2n3 auxiliary superelds; in fact,

11

dimr(y ) = (2n + 1)d. the (2n3)d algebraic equations (3.14) then bring us back to the
complex 2d-dimensional total space of tm, embedded now in the much bigger y as an
algebraic variety!

this is not dissimilar to the approach of [14, 15], where (super)string compactications

on calabi-yau manifolds [16, 17] were discussed with the aid of the non-linear -model

(5.3)

for notation see [15]. here too, one starts from a larger eld space which is then dy-
namically constrained to the calabi-yau algebraic subvariety, dened as the the common
zero-set of the simultaneous (complex) algebraic equations pa() = 0.

however, in (5.3), the algebraic constraints on the -space are enforced through the
introduction of the additional lagrange multiplier superelds, a. the models considered
in this note are more frugal: the constraints (3.14) are enforced through varying the very
same superelds which are being eliminated. in this respect, the present situation is some-
what more similar to the landau-ginzburg approach of ref. [14], where the projectivity
of the kinetic term turns some of the elds into eectively auxiliary lagrange multipliers.
ultimately, the approaches of refs. [14] and [15] become analytic continuations of one an-
other, within the context of wittens gauged linear -model [18], or dierent gauge choices
in the non-linear -model [19]. in addition, this unifying approach rmly establishes re-
lations to toric geometry [20]. here, however, it is not clear how such a relation could be
established, since the multiplets (5.1) are all real (5.2), except when n  , precluding
the usual coupling to u(1) gauge eldsessential for relations to toric geometry `a la the
works in references [18, 20].

so, the algebraic system (3.14) seeming inherently real, it seems quite dissimilar to
the system pa() = 0, produced by varying the chiral superpotential in (5.3) by the chiral
a. note, however, that the whole lagrangian superdensity l(u, u, v ; , , , ) within
the square brackets in (3.11), and so also the real function p in (5.3), may be regarded
as (twice) the real part of a holomorphic function. that is, l = l + h.c., where l is a
holomorphic function of the 2n+1 n = 1 superelds k before the reality condition (5.2)
is imposed. from l(k), we obtain l by imposing the reality condition (5.2) on the ks
and then adding the hermitian conjugate. furthermore, the functions being constrained

to vanish in eqs. (3.14) are real parts of holomorphic functionsthe same ones as in
eqs. (3.14), but before the reality condition (5.2) enforced.

the situation is roughly as follows:

(0, 1, . . . , 2n1, 2n) = y c

(, , . . . , , ) = y

(5.2)y

(3.14)c

 t c

m

(5.2)

(5.4)

(3.14)

 tm

y

in fact, we may assign the (formal) weights, deg(k) = k, so that y c is a complex
weighted ane space. formally, we may assign also deg(w) = 1, so that deg((w)) =
0, whereupon the degree of quasihomogeneity of the action (3.9), and so also of the
holomorphic function l is 2n. of course, the same is obtained upon using the above weight
assignments after the contour integral is evaluated: in the action (3.11), with (3.13). thus,
the variable w eectively projectivizes the whole supereld system y c = (0, . . . , 2n),
and the constraints (3.14) describe the real part of a complete intersection of algebraic
hypersurfaces (each dened by a quasihomogeneous holomorphic polynomial equation) in
a weighted projective space, p (w1, 0, . . . , 2n). the actual (still complex) eld space,
y c where w has been integrated out, may be understood as the w = 1 (ane) coordinate
patch; the compactication of y c into p (w1, 0, . . . , 2n) is a fairly standard method in
algebraic geometry.

for reasons that we hope will be clearer shortly, the passage from tm  y to y c
is reminiscent of the fact that the cycles used in describing the moduli space of complex
structures on calabi-yau weighted complete intersections turn out themselves to be real
parts of algebraic subspaces [21].

finally, as the equations (3.14) are used to eliminate the auxiliary superelds u, v, u,

it is easy to determine their degrees. translating from deg(k), we have

deg(u) = +1 ,

deg(v ) = n ,

deg( u) = 2n  1 ,

(5.5)

and therefore with p = p + h.c.,

degz(cid:16) p

x(cid:17) = j2n  deg(x)

deg(z)

k ,

(5.6)

where x, z range over u, v, u, and   indicates truncation to the integral part.

given the above general observations, one may expect to obtain, after eliminating
the auxiliary superelds u, v, u, the same description of tm, regardless of which of the
o(2n) projective multiplets one used. this, however, is not true.

13

consider, for example, the o(6) case. the three equations of the system (3.14) are
of tri-degree (2,1,1), (1,1,2) and (1,1,1), respectively, with respect to the three auxiliary
elds u, v, u. upon projectivization, these are simply three quasihomogeneous algebraic
equations in three variables, where the coecients depend polynomially and functionally
on ,  and , , respectively; the general methods discussed in ref. [17] apply, although
one must take into account that the coecient functions are all (real parts of) derivatives
of a single function. in particular, as a special case of bezouts theorem, the system (3.14)
is expected to have a 4-fold (degenerate) solution: the p
v equation is linear in v and
yields a unique solution for v in terms of u, u (and of course, , , , ). but then, the
second equation is quadratic in u and linear in u, so that a substitution into the rst
one yields a quartic equation for u , in terms of , , , . the four solutions are related
by a , , , -dependent z4 action, z4. so, upon elimination of the auxiliary elds
u, v, u, the o(6) model describes four z4-related copies of tm. furthermore, as z4 is
a , , , -dependent z4-action, the multiple copies may coincide at special subspace,
b  tm. that is, the target space of the o(6) model is c4
b(tm), a 4-fold cover of tm
branched over b  tm! the case of no branching is included, in which case b = . (for
more information about branched coverings, see ref. [17] and the references therein.)

by contrast, the o(4) model has no such degeneracy, since the only auxiliary supereld,
v , appears linearly in its equation of motion, p
v = 0, and is eliminated uniquely. on the
other hand, even without explicit calculations, it is clear that for n > 3 the target space
of the o(2n) models will become an even higher (branched) cover of tm.

altogether another, but related, issue is that of dualizing the complex (real when
n = 1) linear superelds  into . the s being dual to the , the resulting model, in
terms of ,  (and their conjugates), has t 
m as the target space. in passing from the
action (2.6) to (2.7), one solves eq. (3.7) which for n = 1 is linear in  (and obviously
linear in ). this ensures a 11 mapping   , and so also of the respective models
target spaces tm  t 

m.

consider now what happens when n > 1. for n = 2, eq. (3.7) is cubic in , , and so
assigns three values of  for every value of , in a , -dependent fashion. that is, in
solving (3.7) for ,  in terms of , , we obtain three riemann sheets for each . they
all coincide at least at ,  = 0 = , ; other coincidences may appear depending on
the lagrangian l(, , , ), and so ultimately depending on the choice of the function
f ((w)) in (3.2); the loci of such coincidences introduce branching. since the , -
dependent discrete jump from one to another riemann sheet is not an isometry of the
hyper-kahler structure (and which we wish to preserve), in solving (3.7) we must not

14

identify them (akin to orbifolding) but must include them all. with the three , -
dependent -riemann sheets, the , , , -models target space is then a (possibly
branched) triple cover of the dual of the , , , -models target space. now, as the
- and the -spaces are contractible (as (co)tangent spaces to m), it may be possible
to isolate any one of the -riemann sheets7. if so, we would obtain 3 a priori distinct
, , , -models, the target space of each being the dual of the , , , -models target
space.

for the record, the dualizing map (3.7) for the o(2n) model is

{, }

1  (2n1)
 {, } ,

(5.7)

implying that there are 2n1 -riemann sheets. this leads to a , , , -model the
target space of whihc is a 2n1-fold (branched) cover of the dual of the , , , -models
target space, or to 2n1 a priori distinct dualizations of the , , , -model, using the
isolated various -riemann sheets. in the o(6) case, the target space of the latter we
showed was, c4
b(tm), a (possibly) branched 4-fold cover of tm. eq. (3.7) the produces
either a , , , -model with target space c5
b(t 
m)), or 5 a priori distinctly dualized,
n = 2 , , , -models with target space c4
m), a single -riemann sheets can be
isolated.

b(c4
b(t 

notice that both the system (3.14) and the dualizing map (3.7) are algebraic. this
ensures that the above multiplicity counting is correct, except for possible degenerations
and loss of some of the solutions owing to the real nature of the p
v = 0 equation, and
the non-holomorphy of (3.7). these can be better controlled in the complex category,
i.e., working in the upper row of the diagram (5.4). of course, explicit solutions will be
possible only for rather special choices of the function f ((w)), as noted above.

finally, much of the relations between (super)eld theory and geometry stems from a
cohomological interpretation of the massless sector of the hilbert space. in the nite-n
models considered here, we note that the discrete symmetry (3.15) produces (super)sectors
in the hilbert space and so induces (super)selection rules.

the n = 1 component superelds k have distinct transformations with respect to
the z2n specied in (3.15): ,  are invariant, while ,  transform with ei. correlation
functions must have a total -charge of 0 (mod 2n), which becomes strictly 0 in the
n   limit. this symmetry may be further twisted by n = 1 supersymmetric r-
symmetries, complicating the selection rules accordingly.

7amusingly, this logical possibility arises because of the real projection (5.2).

5.2 some specic field-space issues

while the above discussion, appropriately generalized, applies even to n = 2 models
with more general lagrangians, some of the features we wish to discuss depend exclusively
on the special geometry determined by the single holomorphic function f ((w)).

above, we have drawn some analogies between the present models and the calabi-yau
models (5.3) and their landau-ginzburg relatives [14]. taking these seriously implies
a novel concept for calabi-yau manifolds: that they admit a special geometry metric,
perhaps even one where k (r)(, ) and pa() in (5.3) are all determined by a single
holomorphic function. whether this is in any (useful) way related to the standard
einstein-kahler-yau metric remains an open question, but seems well worth a detailed
study, since there is only an innite iteration procedure for constructing the standard
metric. moreover, the physically relevant metric receives further world-sheet perturbation
and instanton corrections. while it may seem nothing short of a miracle, it is logically
possible that the special geometry metric, suggested by this n = 2 approach and with a
suitable choice of f ((w)) may shortcut this doubly innite iterative procedure and pro-
duce a useful metric on calabi-yau manifolds. furthermore, as we discussed, the dualizing
map (3.7) is a multi-valued map tm  t 
m. now, variations of the complex structure of a
calabi-yau manifold are parametrized by tm-valued 1-forms, while variations of the com-
plexied kahler class are parametrized by t 
m-valued 1-forms. the dualizing map (3.7)
then naturally maps between these two types of variations, and therefore also between
the two corresponding moduli spaces. however, as we have shown above, this map is
multi-valued , and this must be taken into account.

on the other hand, the special geometry is naturally given on the moduli space of
calabi-yau manifolds [22, 23]. as discussed above, the target space of o(2n) models
is closely related to tm, and we can now take m to be the complex structure moduli
space for a calabi-yau manifold rather than the manifold itself. as ref. [23] shows,
special geometry is very closely related to the so-called hodge bration over a complex
moduli space m of a larger space containing tm, the holomorphic tangent space to
mindeed very similar to our situation as described above. the special geometry metric
turns out to be remarkably well determined in terms of the periods of the holomorphic
volume form [22, 23], for which a natural choice of cycles includes the real parts of some
straightforward algebraic subspaces of the calabi-yau manifold [21]. as alluded to above,
this is very reminiscent of the role of the reality projection as shown in the diagram (5.4).
how far these parallels can be exploited further remains another open question.

16

finally, if the chiral superelds are valued in the adjoint representation of some com-
pact lie algebra which possesses a number of non-trivial casimir invariants, then one
obvious choice for the f -functions is given by a (non)linear combination of such invari-
ants. remarkably, this again seems to draw parallels with the description of calabi-yau
complete intersection manifolds [15]. there, the sought after manifolds were embedded
into products of complex projective spaces, which in turn may be represented as cosets
cp n = su(n+1)/u(n). whether a suitable generalization of the standard coset con-
struction, and furthermore subject to algebraic constraints to describe embedded com-
plete intersections is possible with the n = 2 multiplets used here remains an open but
intriguing question, ultimately leading to an n = 2 (and non-abelian) generalization of
the linear -model `a la witten [18].

originality does not consist in saying what no one has ever said before,

but in saying exactly what you think yourself.
