in the last year many new results about d-branes in string theories have emerged.
in the remarkable series of paper by sen [5, 6, 11, 12, 13], the problem of nonsuper-
symmetric conguration in string theories has been studied. it is clear that non-bps
d-branes in the iia, iib theories are as important as supersymmetric ones. on the
other hand it is known that non bps d-branes are not stable, so that they can decay
into supersymmetric string vacuum. instability of this system is a consequence of
tachyon eld that lives on world-volume of non-bps d-brane. but presence of non-
bps brane in the string theory is important from one reason. we can construct kink
solution of tachyonic eld on the world-volume of non-bps d-brane, which forms
d-brane of dimension smaller than original non-bps d-brane. it can be shown on
base of topological arguments that this solution is stable (for a review of this subject,
see [4, 2]). witten generalised this construction and showed that all branes in iib
theory can be constructed as topological defects in space-time lling world-volume
of d9 branes and d9 antibranes [7]. horava extended this construction to the case of
iia theory and showed that all d-branes in iia theory can emerge as topological so-
lutions in space-time lling non-bps d9 branes . horava also proposed an intriguing
conjecture about matrix theory and construction of d0 branes in k theory [8, 14].
for review of the subject d-branes and k theory, see [10], where many references
can be found.

in recent paper sen [1] proposed an supersymmetric invariant action for non-bps
d-branes. because non-bps branes break all supersymmetries, it seams to be strange
to construct supersymmetric action describing this brane. however, although there
is no manifest supersymmetry of world-volume theory, we still expect world-volume
theory to be supersymmetric, with the supersymmetry realised as a spontaneously

1

broken symmetry. from these arguments sen showed that the action has to contain
the full number of fermionic zero modes (32), because they are fermionic goldstone
modes of completely broken supersymmetry, while bps d-brane contains 16 zero
modes, because breaks one half of supersymmetry. sen showed that the dbi action
for non-bps d-brane (without presence of tachyon) is the same as the supersym-
metric action describing bps d-brane. this action is manifestly symmetric under
all space-time supersymmetries. sen argued that ordinary action for bps d-brane
contain dbi term and wz term, which are invariant under supersymmetry but only
when they both are present in the action for d-brane, the action is invariant under
local symmetry on brane  symmetry that is needed for gauging away one half of
fermionic degrees of freedom, so that on bps d-brane only 16 physical fermionic
elds live, as should be for object breaking 16 bulk supersymmetries. sen showed
that the dbi term for non-bps d-brane is exactly the same as dbi term in action of
bps d-brane (when we suppose, that other massive elds are integrated out, includ-
ing tachyon) that is invariant under sypersymmetric transformations, but has no a
 symmetry, so that number of fermionic degrees of freedom is 32 which is a appro-
priate number of fermionic goldstone modes for object braking bulk supersymmetry
completely.

sen also showed how we could include the tachyonic eld into action. because
mass of tachyon is of order of string scale, there is not any systematic way to construct
this eective action for tachyon, but on grounds of invariance under supersymmetry
and general covariance sen proposed the form of this term expressing interaction
between tachyon and other light elds on world-volume of non-bps d-brane. this
term has a useful property that for constant tachyon eld is zero, so that the action
for non-bps vanishes identically.

in present paper we would like to extend the analysis in paper [1]. we propose
the form of the term containing the tachyon and we show that condition of invariance
under supersymmetric transformation places strong constraints on the form of this
term. then we will show that tachyon condensation in the form of kink solution
leads to the dbi action for bps d-brane of codimension one with gauged local 
symmetry.

in conclusion, we will discuss other problems with non-bps d-brane and relation

of this construction to the k-theory.

2. action for non-bps d-brane in iia theory

we start this section with recapitulating basic facts about non-bps d-branes in iia
theory, following [1]. let ,  = 0, ...p are world-volume coordinates on d-brane.
fields living on this d-brane arise as the lightest states from spectrum of open string
ending on this d-brane. these open strings have two cp sectors [6]: rst, with
unit 2  2 matrix, which correspond to the states of open string with usual gso

2

projection (1)f |i = |i, where f is world-sheet fermion number and |i is state
from hilbert space of open string living on dp-brane. the second cp sector has cp
matrix 1 and contains states having opposite gso projection (1)f |i = |i.
the massless elds living on dp-brane are ten components of x m (), m = 0, ..., 9 ;
u(1) gauge eld a() and fermionic eld  with 32 real components transforming
as majorana spinor under transverse lorenz group so(9, 1). we can write  as sum
of left handed majorana-weyl spinor and right handed majorana-weyl spinor:

 = l + r, 11l = l, 11r = r

(2.1)

all elds except r come from cp sector with identity matrix, while r comes from
sector with 1 matrix. 1

as sen [1] argued, action for non bps d-brane (without tachyon) should go to
the action for bps d-brane, when we set r = 0 (we have opposite convention that
[1]). from this reason, action for non-bps d-brane in [1] has been constructed as
supersymmetric dbi action, which is manifestly supersymmetric invariant, but has
not  symmetry, so we cannot gauge away one half of fermionic degrees of freedom,
so that this action describes non-bps d-brane.

the next thing is to include the eect of tachyon. in order to get some relation
between tachyon condensation and supersymmetric d-branes, we would like to have
an eective action for massless eld and tachyon living on world-volume of non-bps
d-brane. this eective action should appear after integrating out all massive modes
of open string ending on dp-brane. because tachyon mass is of order of string scale,
there is no systematic way to obtain eective action for this eld, but we can still
study some general properties of this action. following ref.[1], the eective action
for non-bps dp-brane with tachyonic eld on its world-volume should has a form:

s = z dp+1s det(g +

2f)f (t, t, l, r,g, ..)

 = x m  m  , g = m n m

and

(2.4)

f = f  [11m ( x m 

m  )  (  )]

g was included in the function f in(2.2).

the constant c = 2tp =
we must say few words about function f , which expresses the presence of tachyon
on world-volume of unstable non-bps d-brane. we know that this function must
1our conventions are following. m are 32  32 dirac matrices appropriate to 10d with relation
{m , n} = 2m n with m n = (1, 0, ..., 0). for this choice of gamma matrices the massive dirac
equation is (m m  m ) = 0. we also introduce 11 = 0...9, (11)2 = 1. we also work in
units 42 = 1. then tension of bps dp-brane is equal to tp = 2
g where g is a string coupling
constant.

be invariant under poincare symmetry and supersymmetry. we also expect, that
this function must express interaction between light massless elds living on world-
volume of non-bps d-brane and tachyon. we will also suppose in construction of
this function, that other massive elds were integrated out. and nally, following [1]
we demand, that this function is zero for tachyon equal to its vacuum expectation
value t0 and for t = 0 is equal to tp tension of bps d-brane, which corresponds to
(1)fl projection, which projects out tachyon eld and also fermionic eld from 1
sector, so that resulting d-brane is bps dp-brane in type iib theory [2] 2 :

f (t = t0) = 0, f (t = 0) =

2
g

(2.5)

now we propose the form of this function. firstly, it must contain kinetic term

for tachyon, which should be written in manifest supersymmetry invariant way:

ikt = g

s t  t

(2.6)

where g denotes the matrix inverse of g + 1
2f and gs means the symmetric part
of the matrix. as was argued in ref.[1], the choice of this metric was motivated by
work [15], where was argued that in constant background b eld the natural metric
for open strings is gs and ordinary products becomes noncommutative products. on
the other hand, in [16, 17] it was shown, that natural noncommutative parameter
is gauge invariant combination of f  b, where f is a constant background eld
strength of gauge eld living on world-volume dp-brane. from these reasons, we
take the same metric as in [1], but due to the vanishing of b eld and background f
eld strength we expect that noncommutative eects do not appear in our case and
hence we will consider ordinary products between any functions. we will see that
the function f is really invariant under all symmetries presented above.

there should be potential term for tachyon in function f . we suppose form of

this term as:

v (t ) = m2t 2 + t 4 +

m4
4

this potential has a vacuum value equal to

dv
dt

= 0  t 2

0 =

m2
2

, v (t0) = 0

(2.7)

(2.8)

2in fact, sen argued, that in case of constant t , f reduces to the potential for tachyon and as a
consequence of general form of potential for tachyon, this term is zero for t = t0. in this article, we
slightly change behaviour of this function, because we only demand that in point on world-volume,
where the tachyon is equal to its vacuum value t0, we should recover supersymmetric vacuum, so
that there are no elds living on non-bps d-brane, so we have (2.5). sen also argued that for t = 0
function f should be equal to c, but we think that this function should rather be equal to tp from
reasons explained above.

4

we also expect that some interaction terms between tachyon and x elds and
gauge elds will be presented in f . in fact the interaction between t and x, a is pre-
sented in kinetic term for tachyon, which can be seen from the form of gs. we must
also stress that tachyon is not charged with respect to gauge eld because transforms
in adjoin representation of gauge group and u(1) has no adjoin representation. from
this reason there are no covariant derivatives in the action.

as a last thing, we will consider the interaction term between tachyon and

fermionic elds l, r. we propose this term in the form:

it f = g(t )(t

r0m m



g
s  r +t

l0m m



s l)+f (t ) g
g

s t

r0l (2.9)

where g(t ) is even function of t and f (t ) is odd function of t , which comes from
the fact that in perturbative diagrams in string theory t comes with cp factor 1
and l with cp matrix 1 and nally r with cp factor 1. then it is clear that rl
gives 1 so in order to have nonzero trace over cp factors, we must have f (t ) with
odd powers of t , which gives factor 1. in the same way it can be shown that g(t )
must be even function. we have also used the important properties of majorana-
weyl spinors which say that expression of two weyl spinors of the same chirality
with odd number of gamma matrices is zero and expression of two weyl spinors of
opposite chirality with even number of gamma matrices is zero, which can be seen
from following simple arguments:

t
l (i...k)l = t

l 11(i...k)11l = t

l (i...k)l

(2.10)

where we have used the fact, that 11 commutes with even number of gamma matrices
and anticommutes with odd numbers of gamma matrices.

in summary, we expect that f has a form:

22

g

f =

( g
s t  t + v (t ) + it f )

(2.11)

we know that f must be invariant under supersymmetric transformations as well
as under lorenz transformations and translations. we will see that requirement of
supersymmetric invariance place important conditions on various terms in the action.

under space-time translation, which has a form

we have

so that f is invariant.

(2.12)

under so(1, 9) lorenz symmetry various elds transform as

n n . then

g = m n m

consequently

l = kl. in the similar way we can show that f = 0 and

to prove lorenz invariance of fermionic terms we use

(2.22)

we see that the all integration terms between fermions and tachyon are lorenz
invariant.

now we come to the crucial question of supersymmetry transformation, which

have a form

 = , x m = m 

it is well known, that these transformations leave m
well. it can be also shown [19] that f is invariant as well. as a result we have

 invariant, consequently g as

 gs = 0

(2.23)

now we are ready to prove invariance of the term

f (t ) g

s t

r0 l =

1
2

f (t ) g

s (1  11) 

(2.24)

this term is clearly invariant under supersymmetry transformations due to the pres-
ence of partial derivative. on the other hand, the term

1
2

g(t ) g

s m (1 + 11)m

  

leads after supersymmetric transformation to the variation of the action

s = z dm (1 + 11)m

   = z (dm

 )m (1 + 11)

where we have used

d = s det(g +

1
2f )

1
2

g(t ) g

s

(2.25)

(2.26)

(2.27)

we see that requirement of invariance under transformation of supersymmetry leads
to conclusion that term g(t )... should not be present in the action for non-bps d-
brane, so that we consider interaction term between fermions and tachyon in the
form:

f (t ) g

s t

r0 l

(2.28)

it is important to stress that this term is consistent with requirement, that f (t )
should be odd function of t . this can be seen from the fact that gs has a cp factor
equal to unit matrix. to prove this we expand g as follows:

g = m n x m x n  2m n x m n   + m n (m )(n  )

(2.29)

we know that x m comes from cp sector with unit matrix, so that only one dan-
gerous term is

n   = (r + l)t 0n (r + l) = t

r0n  r + t

l 0n  l

(2.30)

these two terms give cp factors either (11 = 1) (for l) or (11) = 1 for (r)
r110m 11l =
(in previous part we have used the result: t
t
example expression 11m  is equal to t
we have used the identity

r0m l).
in the same way we can prove that f comes with unit matrix of cp factors. for
l 011m l, where

r0m l = t

r011m r + t

l 011m r = t
t

l 11011m 11r = t

l 011m r

(2.31)

it seams to us that requirement of supersymmetry places strong constraint on
various coupling between fermions and tachyon.
in particular, we have seen that
fermions must always come with partial derivative. in next section we will shown
that tachyon condensation in form of kink solution leads to correct supersymmetric
invariant dbi action of bps d(p-1)-brane.

3. tachyon condensation on world-volume of non-bps d-brane

in this section we will consider tachyon condensation on world-volume of non-bps
dp-brane in the form of kink solution.
in order to get clear picture of resulting
d-brane, we will consider tachyon kink solution in the form:

t0, x < 0
0, t = 0
t0, x > 0

(3.1)

t (x) = 


where x is one particular coordinate on world-volume of non-bps dp-brane. we
get equation of motion for tachyon from variation of (2.2), which give (we consider
dependence of tachyon only on x, say p coordinate):

where f has a form:

f =

22

g

d

dx   f

xt! 

df
dt

= 0

s t t + v (t ) + f (t ) g
(cid:16) g

s  t

r0l(cid:17)

first equation in (3.2) gives
( gx

s xt (x)) = ( gx)xt = 0

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

where we have used the fact that tachyon eld is only function of x and the fact that
we can look at the solution (3.1) as a extreme limit of ordinary kink solution, when
behaviour of tachyon eld can be approximated around the point x = 0 as t  x.
more precisely, when we take solution which is equal to tachyon vacuum value t0
at distance x = l from the point x = 0 than we get tachyon eld around the point
x = 0 in the form t = t0
l x. it is clear that second derivative of this expression is
zero. in order to get (3.1) we must take limit l  0 for x  0 in such a way that
t  0 for x  0.

outside the point x = 0 this equation is trivially obeyed because t (x) is equal
to its vacuum value t0. in the point x = 0 we have xt (x)  (x) so that to obey
equation of motion we must pose the condition

s (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=0
gx

= const.  gx |x=0 = const., fx |x=0 = const.

(3.5)

when we look at denition of g we will see, that this condition implies x  = kx
which has a form of static gauge which certainly is not correct for  6= x so we come
to the result gx = 0 for  6= x and with appropriate form of scaling we can take
gxx = gxx = 1. for fx = fx = const. (where we have used the upper result
xx  = xl = xr = 0,  6= x) we can take this constant to be equal to zero,
because the presence of the constant term do not aect the equation of motion.

8

the second term in (3.2) gives

dv
dt 



df (t )

dt

g
s t

r0 l = 0

(3.6)

it easy to see that (3.1) is a solution of equation dv

0 1) = 0. outside
the point x = 0 the tachyon eld is equal to its vacuum value so the expression in
the bracket is zero and in the point x = 0, t is equal to zero. in the point x = 0 the
value of potential is equal to m4
4 .

dt = 2m2t ( t 2

t 2

now we come to the second term in (3.2). we know that f (t ) is odd function
of t so that we can expect that its derivative df (t )
is nonzero. the only possibility
dt
to obey equation of motion for tachyon is to pose the condition that r or l is
equal to zero. we choose the condition:

r = 0

(3.7)

strictly speaking we have obtained this condition from behaviour of tachyon outside
the point x = 0. in the point x = 0 we expect that derivative of f is still nonzero
but gx

s = 0 so that in the point x = 0 we have condition

r = 0,  = 0, ..., p  1

(3.8)

but with using (3.5) and consequences resulting from it we see that (3.7) must holds
in the point x = 0 as well. we have arrived to the important result that r is non-
dynamical eld which can be set to equal to zero. in other words, we have eliminated
via tachyon condensation one half of fermionic degrees of freedom with direct parallel
of gauging of  symmetry on world-volume of bps d-brane.

we come to the nal result. we have seen that (3.1) is equation of motion for

tachyon. when we put this function into (3.3) we get

f (t = kink) =

22

g

t 2
0 (x)

(3.9)

where we have used gxx
s = 1 and (x)2 = (x). in previous equation we have also used
the fact that the derivation is much larger that the vacuum value of the potential.
in order to get correct tension of resulting d-brane we must x the vacuum value of
tachyon to be equal to t 2
2 . when we put (3.9) into (2.2) and with using (3.5),
(3.7) we get the  xed action for d(p-1)-brane in type iia theory:

0 = 1

s = 

2

g z dps det(g +

1
2f )

(3.10)

there is a place when we can discuss some questions about interaction terms
between fermions and tachyon. in previous part we have estimated the possible form

9

of interaction term between fermions and tachyon on grounds of invariance under
supersymmetry. we may ask the question, whether other possible terms which were
not included into the form of f do not spoil the result of emergence of bps d-brane
from tachyon condensation on world-volume of non-bps d-brane. for example, we
can consider the interaction of the form:

g
s g(t 2)m



g
s lm  l

(3.11)

which is consistent with requirement of invariance under all symmetries presented
above as well as with the trace of cp factors. the answer is that this term is zero
for tachyon approaching kink solution and consequently do not give any constraint
on massless elds.

when we write g(t ) = t 2 + t 4..., than xg(t ) = 2t xt + 4t 3xt + ... and
t = 2t + 4t 3 + ... so that the rst term in equation of motion for

consequently xg
tachyon gives contribution

while the second term is equal to

2t + 12t 2t + ...

2t + 12t 2t + ...

(3.12)

(3.13)

then we see, that the term xg(t 2) obeys equation of motion identically and we do
not get any additional constraint on massless elds. moreover, when we put kink
solution into this term we will see that this term is identically equal to zero. outside
the core of the soliton t is in its vacuum value t 2 = t 2
v so that its derivative is
zero and in the point x = 0 we can consider this kink solution as a extreme limit of
ordinary solution. than t t is zero in the point x = 0 due to the fact that t is zero
in the point x = 0. when we go to extreme limit, this expression is always equal to
zero in this limiting procedure so we can conclude that is zero in extreme limit as well.
we than see that this interaction term is identically zero after tachyon condensation
and do not give any new information and any new constraint on fermionic eld so
that we do not include this term into denition of f function in (2.2). we also
expect that other possible interaction terms do not give new information and from
this reason we will consider the f function in the form given in (3.3).

we must also discuss the situation when t is equal to its vacuum value every-
where. naively we could expect from the form of (3.3) that for this value of tachyon
we do not get supersymmetric vacuum due to the presence of the interaction term
between tachyon and fermions. however, tachyon vacuum value must be solution of
equation of motion and as we have seen this leads to requirement of constant spinor
eld r. then interaction term between fermions and tachyon is equal to zero and
from the denition v (t = t0) = 0, xt = 0 and we get the result that the second
bracket is equal to zero and consequently the whole action disappears with agreement
with ref.[1].

10

4. conclusion

in previous parts we have proposed the possible form of supersymmetric dbi ac-
tion for non-bps d-brane in type iia theory (for iib theory the situation will
be basically the same with dierence that both spinors have the same chirality).
we have seen that requirement of invariance under supersymmetric transformations
place strong constraints on possible form of this action. then we have studied the
kink solution of tachyon on world-volume of non-bps dp-brane in iia theory and
we have shown, that this solution really describes bps d(p-1)-brane in iia theory,
which is in agreement with results in [5, 7, 8] and in some sense can serve as further
support of their results.

we would like to outline the possible extension of this work. it would be certainly
nice to study situation when we have n non-bps d-branes and tachyon condenses
in more general conguration. it would be also interesting to study tachyon conden-
sation on system of d9-branes and antibranes in type iib theory following [7]. we
hope to return to these important question in the future.
