abstract

we study some properties of a dimensional reduction mechanism
for fermions in an odd number d + 1 of spacetime dimensions. a
fermionic eld is equipped with a mass term with domain wall like
defects along one of the spacelike dimensions, which is moreover com-
pactied. we show that there is a regime such that the only relevant
degrees of freedom are massless fermionic elds in d dimensions. for
any xed gauge eld conguration, the extra modes may be decoupled,
since they can be made arbitrarily heavy. this decoupling combines
the usual kaluza-klein one, due to the compactication, with a mass
enhancement for the non-zero modes provided by the domain wall
mechanism. we obtain quantitative results on the contribution of the
massive modes in the cases d = 2 and d = 4.

1 introduction.

domain wall fermions have been a very active subject of theoretical research
because of their many interesting properties and applications. they have
recently attracted increased attention in their application to kaplans [1]
domain wall approach to the problem of putting chiral fermions on a lattice.
this proposal has evolved into another, more abstract construction, the so-
called overlap formalism [2, 3, 4], that was designed in order to bypass
nielsen-ninomiyas no-go theorem [5]. it gives a procedure to dene a chiral
determinant in d = 2k dimensions in terms of the overlap (that is, scalar
product) between two dierent dirac vacua. these vacua correspond to two
dirac hamiltonians in d = 2k + 1 spacetime dimensions, in the presence of
the same static external gauge eld, but with opposite signs for their (dirac)
mass terms. this idea has been extensively applied to dierent models,
testing its predictions and consequences for both its continuum and lattice
versions. particular interest has been directed to the issue of chiral anomalies.
the original idea has been also extended to the odd dimensional case [6], and
to the bosonic case [7]. recently, fermions of domain-wall like defects have
also been studied in the context of condensed matter systems [8, 9].

up to know, all the tests performed so far suggest that, when properly
regularized, domain wall fermions may indeed provide a satisfactory deni-
tion of a chiral fermionic determinant. this denition, either in its overlap
or domain-wall version, demands the introduction of a parameter , with
the dimensions of a mass, which has to go to innity at some point of the
construction. a nite- denition, on the other hand, provides an eec-
tive denition of the chiral determinant, valid when low-momentum external
gauge-eld congurations are considered. chiral 2k dimensional modes are
conned to a strip of width  1
 around a 2k-dimensional hypersurface
dened by the position of the domain wall, say, x2k+1 = 0.

in this paper we study domain wall fermions from the dimensional re-
duction point of view. that is to say, we assume the extra dimension x2k+1
to be compactied, and we want to understand the combined eects of the
domain walls and the compact dimension on the eective dimensionally re-
duced theory. the eective low-energy theory arising in this kind of system
involves elds of both chiralities, since the use of a compactied extra di-
mension automatically produces a domain anti-domain wall pair and their
companion fermionic modes of opposite chiralities. we obtain the conditions
that have to be satised by the parameters of the theory, in order to have a

2

regime where the massive modes are decoupled. in other words, we nd the
conditions for the theory to be eectively dimensionally reduced to a model
of massless dirac fermions in 2k dimensions.

this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we dene and discuss, in
the functional integral approach, the dynamics corresponding to the fermionic
modes in an odd dimensional theory with a compactied dimension, regard-
ing the gauge eld as external (non-dynamical). we rst deal with a re-
stricted class of external gauge eld congurations, which are in fact similar
to the static ones of the overlap formalism, and afterwards extend the study
to more general gauge eld congurations. we then show how to extract the
eective dynamics of the reduced theory, and to assure the decoupling of the
higher modes. as explicit examples, the decoupling for the abelian case in
4 + 1 and 2 + 1 dimensions is discussed in the framework of perturbation
theory.

2 dimensional reduction

the euclidean functional integral corresponding to a fermionic eld in the
presence of an external gauge eld a, in d + 1 dimensions, and with a mass
term depending on the extra coordinate xd+1  s, is dened by

z(a) = z [d ][d] exp(cid:18)z dd+1x d(cid:19)

(1)

where the euclidean dirac operator d appearing in the fermionic action is
(2)

d = sds + m(s)+ 6d(a) .

we shall adopt the conventions that greek indices run from 1 to d; x =
(x),  = 1    d will denote the d uncompactied physical dimensions,
while s stands for the compactied one (xd+1). also, diracs  matrices are
hermitian, obeying the relations

{, } = 2 , {, s} = 0 , 2

s = 1 .

(3)

2.1 restricted gauge eld congurations

we want to express the euclidean functional integral (1) for z(a) in a form
that renders the existence and properties of the domain wall fermions more

3

transparent. to this eect we shall introduce an expansion of the fermionic
elds in terms of a suitable hermitian operator. as d is not hermitian, we
introduce the explicitly hermitian, positive denite operator h, dened in
terms of d as follows:
(4)

h = dd .

we rst assume that ad+1 = 0, and a = a(x). this restriction (to be
relaxed in subsection 2.2) is imposed in order to have a clean factorization
into the dynamics along the x-coordinates and along s, as then h is the sum
of two commuting pieces
(5)

h = h  6d2
where h acts on the extra coordinate s only

h = 2

s + m2(s)  sm(s) ,

(6)

with m(s) = d
ds m(s). we also dene projectors corresponding to the two
eigenvalues 1 of s, named pl,r, respectively, and two operators a, a, acting
on the hilbert space of functions depending on the coordinate s

a = s + m(s) , a = s + m(s) .

(7)

the boundary conditions for the functions upon which these operators act
are always going to be such that they become relatively adjoint. that will
hold true for both the compact and non-compact cases.

after these denitions, h may be written as

h = aapl + aapr  6d2

or

h = (aa  6d2)pl + (aa  6d2)pr .

(8)

(9)

we dene normalized eigenfunctions corresponding to the hermitian and
positive operators aa and aa,

aaf (+)
aaf ()

n (s) = e 2
n (s) = e 2

nf (+)
nf ()

n (s)
n (s) ,

(10)

and note that, as the extra dimension is compactied, both operators shall
have zero modes, namely, eigenfunctions f (+)
(s) with e0 = 0.
they shall correspond to the equations

(s) and f ()

0

0

af (+)

0

(s) = 0 , af ()

0

(s) = 0 ,

(11)

4

respectively. had the extra dimension been of innite extension, one of the
zero modes f (+), f () would have disappeared, because it must have had
an innite norm. we shall here assume that the extra dimension is nite:
s  [l, l], and that m(s) is periodic, so that we always have both zero
modes. moreover, they can be explicitly written as

where

f ()
0

(s) = n ()

exp[z s

dt m(t)]

n () = (z +l

l

ds exp[ 2z s

dtm(t)]) 1

.

(12)

(13)

it is convenient at this point to be more specic about the functional form of
m(s). the simplest possibility within the compactied case is to give m(s)
a positive step at s = 0

(14)
which, because of periodicity, does also have a negative jump at s = +l 
l. this yields for the zero modes the explicit expression

m(s) =  sign(s) ,

f (+)

f ()

(s) = s
(s) = s

e2l  1

e|s|

e|s| ,

(15)

which shall correspond to modes localized around s = 0 and s = l, respec-
tively. in the uncompactied case, on the other hand, as l  , only the
mode f (+)
survives. it is evident how to extend the previous zero mode solu-
tions to the general case of a stepwise mass prole m(s) such that m2(s) = 2.
keeping (8) in mind, we see that the eigenfunctions of h shall be products
of eigenfunctions of aapl or aapr, times eigenfunctions of 6d2. we then
expand the fermionic elds (x, s) and (x, s) in terms of these eigenfunc-
tions. of course, each term will also depend on an arbitrary d-dimensional
spinor (n)(x):

(x, s) = xn hf (+)
(x, s) = xn hf (+)

n

n (s)pl(n)(x) + f ()
(s) (n)(x)pr + f ()

n

n (s)pr(n)(x)i

(s) (n)(x)pli ,

(16)

5

or

(x, s) = xn hf (+)
(x, s) = xn h (n)

n (s)(n)

l (x) + f ()

l (x)f (+)

n

(s) + (n)

n (s)(n)

r (x)i
r (x)f ()

n

(s)i ,

(17)

with (n)

l,r(x) = pl,r(n)(x), and (n)

l,r(x) = (n)(x)pr,l.

we could, of course, expand each (n) in terms of the eigenfunctions of
 6d2, but that shall not be necessary. note that no approximation has been
invoked in order to obtain the expansions (16) and (17), since we are only
applying the property that h can be written as the sum of two commuting
pieces, and we can always expand any state in such a way as to make one of
the pieces diagonal.

using expansion (17), we have a decomposition of the fermionic integra-

tion measure,

[d] [d ] = yn (cid:16)[d(n)

l ][d (n)

l ][d(n)

r ][d (n)

r ](cid:17) ,

(18)

and a series for the fermionic action.
in this series, to
separate what corresponds to the zero modes, from the contributions due to
the higher ns, since they shall have quite dierent properties. explicitly, it
reads

it is convenient,

l (x) + (n)

l (x)(n)

(19)

this shows that there appear massless d-dimensional fermionic elds
localized around the domain wall defects, and that there is an innite tower
of massive states. these states can be decoupled of the massless ones, since
their masses en will satisfy, as shown below, the inequality

en  r||2 + (


l

)2 .

(20)

thus the masses of these higher modes can be made arbitrarily large by
proper choices of the parameters , l.

let us proof inequality (20) for the eigenvalues of h corresponding to the
modes with n 6= 0. we rst use the property that, for stepwise proles m(s),
such that m2(s) = 2, the only localized states are the zero modes. this can
be proved just by taking into account that localized states are combinations
of real exponentials, and those combinations are completely determined once
the matching conditions due to the  functions are imposed. for the non-zero
modes, the states are combinations of exponentials of ikx. the periodicity
of the extra coordinate xes the minimum k to be 
l , and the -function term
only xes boundary conditions, thus for any eigenstate f ()

(21)

let us consider the issue of decoupling. equations (18) and (19) already

indicate that

z = z (0)  yn6=0z (n)

(22)

where z (0) contains the massless modes of the dimensionally reduced theory

while

(23)

(24)

(n)(n))(cid:21)

are the massive, decoupling modes. of course they will only decouple if some
conditions are imposed on the external gauge elds, namely, their momentum
dependence cannot be arbitrary. in order to achieve decoupling, we have to
assume that the external momenta p, corresponding to the fourier compo-
nents of the gauge elds, are small in comparison to en. this guarantees the
existence of a momentum expansion for the massive determinants of (24).
the terms of such an expansion are suppressed by powers of p2
, since the
e 2
feynman diagrams are analytic below the threshold.

2.2 general gauge eld congurations

in the preceding subsections we have addressed the issue of decoupling in the
presence of external gauge elds satisfying the conditions,

sa = 0 ,

as = 0 .

(25)

as mentioned in subsection 2.1, under conditions (25), the eigenfunctions
of dd can be factored into eigenfunctions of h times eigenfunctions of (6d)2.
in the present subsection we present a perturbative proof of the fact that,
even for the general case, namely, relaxing (25), we still have a non-vanishing
gap of o() in the spectrum of dd. the spirit of the proof is to use the
fact that, by performing a perturbative expansion around the restricted case
(25), the correction to the gap is negligible when the gauge eld is smooth.

we split dd into free (h) and perturbation (v ) terms

dd = h + v

where h is the one discussed in 2.1, i.e.,
(s)  2

h = m(s)2  sm



s  (6d)2(a(x, s = 0))

(26)

(27)

and v is dened by

v = sas  a2

s  sfs+ 6d2(a(x, s = 0)) 6d2(a) .

(28)

the free term is o(2), while for the perturbation we shall assume that
the gauge eld is smooth, in the same sense as in the restricted case, namely,
their derivatives are small when compared with . thus the perturbation is
o(0). it is also useful to note that the perturbation is a periodic function
of s.
in order to compute the corrections to the spectrum of (27) we should

consider matrix elements of the following kind:

< n|v |m >= z l

l

ds f 

n (s)(cid:26)z ddx n

lr(x)v (x, s)n

lr(x)(cid:27) f 

n (s)

where v (x, s) may be written as a fourier series,

v (x, s) = xn (cid:20)v e

n (x)cos(

ns

l

) + v o

n (x)sin(

ns

l

)(cid:21)

8

(29)

(30)

and the functions f 
n (s) appearing in (29) are the excited states eigenfunc-
tions of h. they are odd or even (h is invariant under s  s) and are
explicitly given by,

f +,o
n (s) =

f +,e
n (s) =

n

ns

n = (

l

(31)

(32)

in both cases.
in order to estimate the perturbative correction, we see
that the  dependence of the matrix elements (29) is determined by the
s-integration, since the parameter  only appears in the f 
n functions. from
formulae (30) and (31) it is evident that this matrix elements are at most of
o(0). therefore, when the fourier components of the gauge elds are small
compared with , the corrections to the unperturbed energy levels (32) do
not eliminate the gap of o() of the unperturbed theory. indeed, the correc-
tions to the eigenvalues are not capable of modifying a gap of order , since
they always involve o(0) terms.

2.3 the fermionic propagator

the results of 2.1 were important in order to understand the mechanism on
decoupling, from the point of view of the gauge eld action. namely, the
contribution to the eective gauge eld action due to the fermion loops is
shown to be given mainly from the contribution of the massless, domain wall
modes. however, for physical processes involving external fermions, we need
to consider a dierent case, since we have to include fermionic sources (x, s)
(x, s) into the functional integral (1):

z(, ; a) = [z(a)]1z [d ][d] exp {s
+ z dsddx[(x, s)(x, s) + (x, s)(x, s)](cid:27) .

(33)

expanding the measure and the action, according to (18) and (19), respec-
tively, we have, after integrating out the fermions

z(, ; a) = z (0)(, ; a)  yn6=0z (n)(, ; a) .

(34)

9

z (0)(, ; a) is the generating functional corresponding to the domain wall
fermions:

z (0)(, ; a) =
exp(cid:26)z dsddxz dsddx (x, s)[f (+)

0

6d1(x, x) [f (+)

0

(s)pl + f ()

0

(s)pl]

0

(s)pr + f ()
(s)pr](x, s)o ,

(35)

while z (n)(, ; a) contains the innite tower of massive fermionic elds

z (n)(, ; a) =
exp(cid:26)z dsddxz dsddx (x, s)[f (+)
(s)pl + f ()

(6d + en)1(x, x) [f (+)

0

0

0

(s)pr + f ()
(s)pl]
(s)pr](x, s) .

0

(36)
again, decoupling is achieved when the masses (en) in the propagators de-
rived from (36) are large compared with the external momenta (now the
momenta of the fermions are also relevant). the domain wall piece (35)
allows us to write down their contribution to the fermionic propagator

h(x, s) (x, s)i =





e(|s|+|s|) 6d1(x, x)pl +

e(|s|+|s|) 6d1(x, x)pr . (37)
1  e2l
it is straightforward to obtain the expression for j(x, s), the vacuum current
contribution due to this part of the fermion propagator. with the usual
denitions, we see that

e2l  1

j(x, s) = h (x, s)(x, s)i
 trhh(x, s) (x, s)ii
e2l  1

e2|s|jl

(38)

where jl
mensions:

 (x) and jr

 (x) denote the corresponding vacuum currents in d di-

 (x) = h l(x)l(x)i
jl
 (x) = h r(x)r(x)i .
jr

10

(39)

it becomes clear from the above that the contributions of the chiral zero
modes to the current are localized around each domain wall, with a local-
ization length  1
in order to be able to resolve the two currents, the
 .
localization length should be smaller than the compactication length, what
amounts to the inequality

  l > 1 .

(40)

regardless of whether the two chiral currents have a large overlap or not,
the integral of the d + 1 dimensional current j(x, s) along the s coordinate
always produces the result corresponding to the current of a dirac fermions
in d dimensions

z l

l

ds j(x, s) = j(x) = h (x)(x)i ,

(41)

where  = l + r.

we shall also present, for the sake of completeness, a derivation of the
fermionic propagator obtained by directly inverting the operator d of (1), in
4 + 1 dimensions. we consider the free (a = 0) case for the sake of clarity,
since, for this calculation, the necessary changes for the non-free case are
easy to introduce. moreover, this free propagator in 4 + 1 is used in the next
subsection, in the perturbation theory example. this system is described by
the free euclidean action:

s = z dsddxlf , lf = (6  + m(s))

the free dirac operator 6  acts on the ve co-ordinates:

6   ii = ss +  .

diracs matrices are chosen to be in the representation:

 =   0 

0 ! , s =   1





0

0 1 ! ,  = (~, i1)

(42)

(43)

(44)

where ~ denotes the three familiar paulis matrices. finally, the domain wall
mass term m(s) is assumed to be of the form:

m(s) =  sign(s)

(45)

11

namely, it contains a domain wall like eect localized at s = 0, and an anti
domain wall companion at s = l. from its denition, it follows that the
fermionic propagator s satises

[6 x,s + m(s)]s(x, s; x, s) = (4)(x  x)(s  s)

(46)

where the subscripts x, s mean that derivatives act with respect to the x, s-co-
ordinates. because of translation invariance in x, a fourier transformation
in these co-ordinates suggests itself:

s(x, s; x, s) = z
hence equation (46) implies for sk

d4k
(2)4

eik(xx) sk(s, s) .

(47)

[ss + ik] sk(s, s) = (s  s) .

(48)

to solve this equation, it is convenient to dene an auxiliary function gk,
determined from sk by the relation

sk(s, s) = [ss  ik + m(s)]gk(s, s)

(49)

which substituted into (46) yields for gk the equation

[2
s + 2s((s)  (s  l)) + k2 + 2]gk(s, s) = (s, s)

(50)

where k2 = kk. then, gk is the inverse of a hamiltonian operator hk
which contains a delta-like potential in a one-dimensional quantum mechan-
ical system

(51)

hk = 

d2
ds2 + 2s((s)  (s  l)) + 2

k

k = k2 + 2.

where 2
in order to invert this operator, it is convenient to
diagonalize it, and then we are back into the issue of knowing the spectrum
of h, the operator considered in the general derivation of the previous sub-
section. again, the domain wall modes correspond to the bound states of
the hamiltonian. keeping only the contribution coming from these states,
we get for gk

gk(s, s) =



k2 h(e2l  1)1e(|s|+|s|)pl

12

which, when introduced in (49) yields,

+(1  e2l)1e(|s|+|s|)pri

sk(s, s) =



1  e2l

e(|s|+|s|)(i 6 k)1pl



e2l  1

e(|s|+|s|)(i 6 k)1pr .

(52)

(53)

2.4 decoupling of the massive modes

to render the general derivations of the previous paragraphs more concrete,
we present here their realization for two particular examples. we consider
the cases d = 4 and d = 2, with abelian external gauge elds. making the
redenitions a  iea, and recalling equations (23) and (24), we may write
for the full functional z(a),

where the eective action (a) is a sum

z(a) = exp [(a)]

(a) = (0)(a) + xn6=0

(n)(a)

with the domain wall eective action

and the contribution of the massive modes

(0) = tr ln[6  + i 6a]

(n) = tr ln[6  + i 6a + en] .

(54)

(55)

(56)

(57)

note that the issue of the convergence of the series over n is not clear at all,
unless one obtain a more explicit expression, in terms of a, for the contri-
bution of the massive modes. to check this in the d = 4 case, we may use
the known results [10] for the derivative expansions of the abelian fermionic
determinants in 4 dimensions, obtaining for the leading terms

(n)

d=4 = z d4x(

(59)

where we are of course neglecting higher dimensional terms. thus, in order to
assure the decoupling of these unwanted contributions to , either in d = 4
or d = 2, we must be able to render

(60)

(and all the series with higher even powers of en in the denominator) arbi-
trarily small by tuning  and l. but that can always be done, because for
large n, the eigenvalues of en will obviously grow at least like n, what makes
the series above absolutely convergent. then we adjust  and l to make
those sums arbitrarily small (note that we could interchange the order of the
limit    or l  0 and the summation of the series). it goes without
saying that higher dimensional terms carry higher powers of 1
, what makes
en
them more convergent.

this concludes our particular examples of decoupling. it is easy to verify
that the convergence arguments remain the same for the case of external non-
abelian elds, since the power of en that appears is 1 xed by dimensional
arguments, identical for the abelian and non-abelian cases.
