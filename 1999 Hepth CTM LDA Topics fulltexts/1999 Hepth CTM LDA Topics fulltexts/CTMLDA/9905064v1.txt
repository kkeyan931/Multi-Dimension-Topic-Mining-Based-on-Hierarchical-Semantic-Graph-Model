abstract

the decoupling limit of the d1-d5 system compactied on t 4  s1 has a
rich spectrum of u(1) charged excitations. even though these states are not

bps in the limit, bps considerations determine the mass and the semiclassical

entropy for a given charge vector. the dependence of the mass formula on
the compactication moduli situates the symmetric orbifold symn (t 4)  t 4
conformal eld theory in the moduli space. a detailed analysis of the global

identications of the moduli space yields a picture of multiple weak-coupling

limits  one for each factorization of n into d1 and d5 charges d1 and d5 =

n/d1  joined through regions of strong coupling in the cft moduli space.

1 introduction and summary

the d1-d5 system is a touchstone of recent progress in string theory. it underlies the

rst reliable counting of black hole microstates [1]; as well as precise calculations of

their cross-sections for absorption and emission of low-energy quanta, in the context of

a unitary quantum-mechanical theory (for review see e.g. [2, 3]). it is a prime example

of the duality between gravitational and non-gravitational dynamics [4, 5, 6, 7] in

certain scaling limits.

when the d1-d5 system is compactied on x 4 = t 4 or k3 in the directions

on the d5-brane that are transverse to the d1-brane, and on a large circle in the

common direction, the low-energy dynamics in the appropriate scaling limit appears
to be generically described by a sigma model on the moduli space of instantons minst
in the d5-brane gauge theory.3 it has been proposed that this sigma model might be
eectively described as a blowup of the symmetric product orbifold symn (x 4).

when x 4 = t 4, there is a large class of of u(1) charged excitations. although

these excitations are not bps after taking the scaling limit, they are bps states

beforehand; moreover, their energies remain nite in the limiting theory. bps con-

siderations thus determine a lower bound on the masses of charged states, as well

as the semiclassical entropy of states satisfying the bound; the evaluation of these

quantities constitutes some of our main results. their determination is not solely

attributable to the fact that these charges couple to a u(1) current algebra in the

limiting theory.

we begin in section 2 with a specication of the scaling limit itself, as a limit of

the bps mass formula where certain charges are taken to describe a heavy brane

background, while others remain light. according to the maldacena conjecture [5],
the dynamics of the heavy brane background is dual to string theory on ads3 
s3  x 4, where the anti-de sitter radius in units of the fundamental string scale is
rads = ls(g2
4 (g6 is the six-dimensional string coupling), and the characteristic
proper size of x 4 is ls(q1/q5)
excitations on x 4 = t 4 depend on the radii of a rectangular four-torus, with all other

moduli set to zero. the resulting mass formula depends separately on the background

one-brane and ve-brane charges q1 and q5 (and not just the product q1q5), due to the

dierent ways the proper size of the four-torus aects the various charged objects [9].

this indicates that the theory in some way distinguishes backgrounds with dierent

one-brane and ve-brane charges.

this leads us in section 3 to a more detailed investigation of the dependence of
the bps mass formula on all the so(5, 5)/so(5) so(5) moduli of compactication
on t 4. we begin with an analysis of the heavy brane background, determining the

tension of objects wrapping the large circle. the minimization of this tension xes

ve of the moduli in terms of the rest [10, 11], reducing the local geometry of the
moduli space to k = so(5, 4)/so(5)  so(4). we give a set of explicit and general
formulae for the xed scalars.

for generic moduli, the d1- and d5-branes are bound together by an amount

determined from the tension formula. the bound state dynamics is the higgs branch

of the low-energy d1-d5 gauge theory, reducing in the infrared to the aforementioned
sigma model on instanton moduli space minst; the singularities of the instanton mod-
uli space are regularized at generic points in the teichmuller space k by nonzero
antisymmetric tensor backgrounds (including the rr scalar) in the ambient space-

time [12, 8]. the binding energy of the brane background vanishes along certain codi-
mension four subspaces of k.4 these are the domains where the d1-d5 bound states
can separate into subsystems. coulomb branches (more precisely mixed coulomb-

higgs branches) of the d1-d5 gauge dynamics describe congurations where these

subsystems are separated in directions transverse to the vebranes. it is the appear-

ance of these new branches that causes the spacetime cft to become singular. we
apply the tension formula to determine the singular locus in the moduli space k for
given background brane charges d1 and d5 (including the case where either of the

charges is equal to one).

having dealt with the heavy background for generic moduli, we proceed to an

analysis of the light u(1)-charged excitations and their dependence on the moduli.

4with periodic (ramond) boundary conditions on fermions. as discussed in [12], there is a nite

gap between the two branches in the presence of antiperiodic (ns) boundary conditions on the

fermions.

2

this exercise provides a great deal of robust, non-topological data that can be com-

pared to particular conformal eld theories such as the symmetric orbifold. later, in

section 6, we use this data to locate the subspace of the moduli space described by

the symmetric orbifold.

in maximal supergravity on t 5, 1/8-bps states have a nite entropy. usually,

the charges participating in this entropy are taken to be the background d1- and d5-

brane charges themselves, together with momentum along their common direction.

however, the nite entropy will persist even when the responsible charges are mis-

aligned with the large circle in the scaling procedure of section 2  for example, a

string could carry both winding and momentum on the small t 4. this nite entropy

of states carrying combinations of u(1) charges is calculated in section 4.

an important part of the structure of moduli spaces of toroidal compactications

is their group of global identications. these are discrete transformations on the

charge lattice and moduli that leave the spectrum invariant. with the full moduli

dependence of the charged spectrum in hand, we are poised for an analysis of these

identications in section 5. in the presence of the heavy brane background, the

full so(5, 5; z) duality group of string theory compactied on t 5 is reduced to the
subgroup h~q that preserves the charge vector of the background. transformations not
in this subgroup do not preserve the xed scalar conditions or the spectrum of u(1)

charged excitations. nevertheless, the theory is covariant under such transformations;

one can transform any given background charges (q1, q5) into (n = q1q5, 1), as long as

one transforms the moduli (including the xed scalars) at the same time. therefore,

the moduli space for charges (n, 1) will be continuously connected to regions having

a natural interpretation in terms of charges (q1, q5). these are simply two dierent

interpretations of the same spacetime conformal eld theory. we call the charge

vector (n, 1) the canonical background.

it is easy to nd transformations from a given charge vector to the canonical charge

vector inside an so(2, 2; z) subgroup of the duality group; a convenient choice is the

so(2, 2; z) subgroup acting on the moduli that are scalar or pseudoscalar on the t 4.

the map from the background charges (q1, q5) to the canonical charges transforms the

singular locus in moduli space to a well-dened region in the fundamental domain of

the moduli in the canonical background. the interesting part of the residual duality

3

group h~q turns out to be a certain diagonal 0(n) inside this so(2, 2; z).5 we show
how the important structure of the fundamental domain of the moduli space of the
spacetime cft inside the teichmuller space k = so(5, 4)/so(5)  so(4) can be
projected onto the fundamental domain of 0(n) acting on  = + i/gs (here  is the

rr scalar, gs the string coupling of type iib string theory). the rational cusps of the

fundamental domain have the interpretation as coming from d1-d5 systems having

dierent partitions of n into one-brane and vebrane numbers (d1, d5 = n/d1). the

singular locus in the cft moduli space, where the system is unstable to decay by

emitting d1- and d5-branes, is located as a set of circular arcs inside this fundamental

domain passing between conjugate cusps. a satisfying picture of the cft moduli

space emerges, whereby dierent weakly-coupled regions of the cft, describing the

spacetime physics of dierent numbers of d1- and d5-branes, are connected through

regions of strong coupling.

one of the goals of our investigation was to pin down the relation between the sym-
metric orbifold symn (x 4) and the d1-d5 spacetime conformal eld theory. in section
6, we match the structure of a somewhat modied symmetric orbifold symn (t 4) t 4
to that of the spacetime cft. the extra t 4 is needed to represent the full spectrum of

sixteen u(1) charges. the u(1) currents of this orbifold naturally split into two sets:

eight (four left-moving and four right-moving) of level n from the symmetric prod-
uct,6 and eight more of level one from the extra t 4. this suggests that the orbifold

naturally describes a region in the cusp of the fundamental domain corresponding to

the canonical charges (n, 1); we indeed nd that all known data are consistent with

this proposal. this data includes the precise spectrum of bps states (including the

upper cuto on r-charges), which matches expectations from duality [13, 14, 15]; the

qualitative growth of the full (non-bps) spectrum [16]; the structure of the moduli

taking one away from the orbifold locus; and the u(1) mass formula.

during the course of our investigations, we learned of related work [17] on the en-

tropy of u(1) charged excitations; and on the global structure of the moduli space [12].

2 the setting

consider type iib string theory toroidally compactied to ve dimensions. this

theory contains 27 u(1) charges: 5 kk-momenta, 5 fundamental strings, 1 fully

wrapped ns5-brane,(cid:16)5

1(cid:17) = 5 d1-branes (d-strings),(cid:16)5

3(cid:17) = 10 d3-branes, and(cid:16)5

5(cid:17) = 1

d5 brane. the u(1) charges transform in the fundamental 27 of the e6(6) duality

group. the toroidal compactication is characterized by 42 moduli that parametrize

the coset space e6(6)/usp(8). in this section we focus on the moduli that are given

by the radii of a rectangular torus, as well as the type iib coupling constant.

the scaling limit: the microscopic description of black holes is based on a eld

theory that does not contain gravity. this theory can be isolated from the full string

theory by taking a suitable limit. the limit leaves one of the radii, say r5, much
larger than the other four radii ri, i = 1, 2, 3, 4. more precisely, we take ls  0 with
ri  ls (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) and r5 xed, while keeping the integer quantized values of the
u(1) charges xed. the scale of energy in the system is set by r1
5 . the eect of
this limit on the various u(1) charges can be judged by considering the mass of singly

charged constituent branes:7

the 10 branes that wrap r5 have masses that scale as l2

s . these are the ns5/d5,

the f1/d1 along r5, and the (cid:16)4

2(cid:17) = 6 d3 branes with one dimension along r5. the

branes that do not wrap r5 and the kk-momenta within the small t 4 have masses
that scale as l1

s ; there are 16 such charges. finally the kk momentum along r5

gives a mass scaling as l0
s.

7the precise denition of the string scale is ls  .

5

in the decoupling limit four dimensions are taken small, so it is natural to interpret

results in terms of the remaining six dimensions even though one of these is actually
compact (with radius r5). the 10, 16, 1 charges with masses that scale as l2
s , l1
s
and l0
s are tensors, vectors, and scalars from this six dimensional point of view. they
transform in the vector (10), spinor (16) and scalar (1) of the so(5, 5) duality group

of the six-dimensional theory. the most massive excitations are those that correspond

to charges of the 10 tensor elds. the strategy is to consider a background created by

these heavy charges and then consider the remaining light charges as excitations

in the resulting theory.

the tensor background: accordingly, rst consider the tensor charges. regular

black holes correspond to congurations where these preserve 1/4 of the supersym-

metry. simple choices of excited charges are the d1 and the d5, or the f1 and the

ns5 (these and other choices are equivalent under the action of the so(5, 5; z) u-

duality subgroup that preserves the distinction between the small and large circles).

we consider the f1/ns5 system without loss of generality. the mass of this brane

background is

the vector excitations: next consider the charged excitations about this back-

f1/ns5 system with momentum along the f1 on a rectangular t 5 with vanishing

parity-odd moduli. in general the f1 is not aligned with any of the coordinate axes,

the formula (5) has the same spectrum as a one-brane current algebra at level

f1 on a torus of radii ri, together with a ve-brane current algebra at level n5 on
a torus of radii ri/v4. this leads to a puzzle [18]: the proposed dual symmetric
orbifold cft has a diagonal u(1)4 current algebra in the untwisted sector of level

n = f1n5, and so would appear at best to describe f1 = n, n5 = 1. we will see

in section 5 that this apparent diculty is an artifact of the particular subspace of

moduli taken into account in (5). at generic points in moduli space, the mass formula

does not neatly separate into a one-brane term and a ve-brane term.

bps arguments guarantee that the masses given in equation (5) are exact, that is,

there are no perturbative or non-perturbative corrections. nevertheless, the excita-

tions are not bps in the decoupled theory. it is the complete set of supersymmetries

in the original string theory that ensures the exactness and some of these are realized

nonlinearly in the decoupled theory. one of the motivations for considering the u(1)

charges is that these are well-behaved non-bps excitations.

in this sense, our situation is directly parallel to that of matrix theory, where parts

of the eleven-dimensional supersymmetry algebra become nonlinearly realized in the

limiting process that denes the construction, and certain bps charges (in that case,

the transverse vebrane charge) decouple from the supersymmetry algebra [19]. this

property is a generic feature of the decoupling limit.

7

the mass formula (5) gives the energy of the lowest state with the specied

charges. more generally this formula can be interpreted as a lower bound on the

energy in the superselection sector with the specied charges. in this way the con-

siderations of this section are relevant at any nite energy in the decoupled theory.

the discussion in this section assumed toroidal compactication. it is straight-

forward to replace the small four-torus with a k3 and scale the volume of the k3 in

the same way. then the heavy charges are carried by 26 tensor elds in the 6d the-

ory that transform in the fundamental representation of the duality group so(5, 21).

however, there are no 6d vectors and so there is less to say about the structure.8

3 masses and moduli

the energy carried by u(1) charged excitations depends sensitively on the moduli

of the background. the purpose of this section is to present a mass formula that
expresses the dependence on general so(5, 4)/so(5)  so(4) moduli.

the tensor fields: consider rst the heavy background, i.e. the 6d tensor elds,

and further assume that the parity-odd moduli vanish.

in this restricted case the

square of the mass is the obvious norm of the so(5, 5) charge vector. we write the

result as

8another puzzle, raised in [15], concerns whether a 1+1d cft can describe the limits in the k3

moduli space where a vanishing cycle on the k3 appears. at these points, a tensionless string appears

in the spectrum of iib string theory; where is this string in the spectrum of the cft? first of all,

tensor charges (for either t 4 or k3) are invisible in the sense that they are part of the specication

of the cft background rather than an excitation of the cft itself. therefore, the appearance of

a light string in the spectrum (which need not be one of those in the brane background) means

that the target space of the cft is becoming strongly curved and/or of small volume in units of

that strings tension, and therefore at least part of the cft is becoming strongly coupled. the

decoupling limit assumed that all the background strings had nite tension in the limit, and this

assumption is breaking down. using duality transformations of the type explored below in section

5, one can relate these limits to decompactication limits in some other duality frame.

where dij5 denote the numbers of d3-branes with one dimension wrapping r5, and
gij is the string metric (e.g. g11 = r2

1 on a square torus). the normalization factor

g6 =

(7)

is convenient because it is invariant under so(5, 5) duality transformations. the

normalization of the various terms in (6) can be veried by writing the right hand

side as the sum of ve perfect squares; the rst is the square of (2), and the others

follow similarly by comparison with (1).

the next step is to include the parity-odd moduli in the background. it turns

out that the general eect of these elds can be summarized through the substitution

rules

f1  f1 = f1 +  d1  (a4

the physical interpretation of these shifts is that the parity-odd moduli induce charges

in addition to the those that are present in the background. this eect is well-known

from the anomaly-induced charges on d-brane world-volumes [20] and, simpler yet,

from the shift in the momentum of the perturbative string in the presence of a ns

b-eld. the full substitution rules (8) can be derived using the methods reviewed

in [21].

the fixed scalars: the classical solutions that correspond to a given charge as-

signment have the property that, in the near horizon region, some of the background

moduli are attracted to values which are independent of the moduli in the asymptot-

ically at region, and which are determined exclusively by the charge vector [10, 11].

from the perspective of the theory without gravity these scalars are not moduli be-

cause they cannot be varied; they are known as xed scalars. their values can be

determined in general by minimizing the mass formula (6) with the substitutions (8).

as a check on our computations we have veried that the xed scalar equations (10-

as expected. in the f1/ns5 system the free moduli can be chosen as the 16 elds
gij + bij as well as the rr-scalar  and the self-dual rr tensor-elds, denoted c +.

the singularities in moduli space: the spacetime conformal eld theory is

singular in a subspace of moduli space [22]. the physical origin of the singularity

was explained in [23, 12]: the d1/d5 system can become unstable to fragmentation

into smaller constituents. decay is only possible for special values of moduli, which

constitute the singular locus of moduli space.

the singular locus of moduli space is determined by the tensor mass formula. for

example, consider the decay of the d1/d5 brane system with charges (d1, d5) into two
fragments with charges (d1  d
1 < d1). the
mass of each constitutent is given by (9), with the background moduli constrained

1, 0), respectively (with 0 < d

1, d5) and (d

by the xed scalar conditions of the initial state (10-12). we further assume for

simplicity that the b+ vanishes and that the rr-scalar  is small. then the change

in mass from initial to nal state is given by

(19)

thus the decay is kinematically forbidden, when  6= 0. on the other hand, when
 = 0 there is no barrier to decay, so the singular locus of modular space includes the

codimension four subspace given by  = b+ = 0. the converse result is also true,

up to duality: fragmentation is possible precisely for the moduli  = b+ = 0, or

others that are related to them by duality9. it is straightforward to show that other

potential decays are also forbidden unless  = b+ = 0. note that since these results

9the global subtleties related to duality are discussed in sec. 5.

are underpinned by bps arguments, they are valid for all values of the charges and

in particular when d5 = 1. this is a necessary consistency condition for the proposal

that the symmetric product describes the case d5 = 1.

in [23, 12] a concrete picture of the singularity in the spacetime cft was achieved

in terms of an eective sigma model of long strings. this description breaks down

completely for d5 = 1; and for d5 = 2 the model cannot describe the perturbation

which lifts the degeneracy of the coulomb and higgs branches (it is not in the chiral

ring of this eective theory for d5 = 2).

it would be interesting to nd a useful

description of the singularity of the spacetime cft in these two special cases.

the vector fields: the next step is to add vector charges to the background of

tensor elds, and then expand as specied by the scaling limit discussed in section

2. the energy associated with the vectors is the total energy of the system less the

mass of the background.

we rst consider a square torus and assume that no non-trivial moduli are turned

on. the desired mass formula follows from bps algebra, as detailed in the appendix.

in the case where the background is the f1/ns5 system the result is

er5 =

(20)

the notation here and in the following is that the metric contracting ~p or ~wd3 with
themselves is gij, the inner product on ~wf 1 or ~wd1 is gij, and cross-terms are con-
tracted with j
i .

the corresponding formula for the d1/d5 system is derived by the s-duality
transformation that takes gs  g1
s gij (so that v4

the energy formulae (20-21) are derived without assumptions about the moduli.

however, in the scaling limit the xed scalar conditions must be imposed.

the next step is to take the parity-odd elds into account. the vector charges

in these formulae there are no terms that are quadratic in the parity-odd elds because

none of the branes carrying vector charge wrap the entire t 4.

the parity-odd elds also shift the background as indicated in (8). in general, this

lead to signicant complications; in particular, it is no longer consistent to choose the

background as one of the canonical ones (d1/d5 or f1/ns5), because the parity-odd

elds mix these with each other and with the d3-branes. however, when the scalars

take their xed point values the result is much simpler: the shifts in background

charges are compensated by changes in the xed scalar values. thus the background

charges are eectively unchanged by the parity-odd moduli. the end result for the

energy of the charges in the d1/d5 background is therefore simply (21) with the shifts

(22) and subject to the xed scalar equations (10-12). the corresponding result for

the f1/ns5 system is (20) with the same shifts but with the xed scalar equations

(15-17).

4 entropy and u(1) charges

in this section we take the heavy background to consist of n5 ns5-branes and f1

fundamental strings. general excitations in this background are characterized by the

value of momentum (the scalar charge), energy, and the 16 vector charges. for

suciently large coupling, these general congurations are interpreted in spacetime

as charged black holes. at small values of the charges and suciently small coupling,
one has an ensemble of brane bound states in ads3  s3  t 4. this section outlines
the calculation of the entropy of such objects.

i.e. the rr bacground is set to zero. the 8 ns-ns u(1) currents form a u(1)4

pretation of conformal levels as left and right moving energy. vertex operators in the

conformal eld theory can be written in the factorized form

v = virr vu(1) ,

(30)

where the latter factor carries all the dependence on the u(1) charges. in the subspace

of moduli space considered here, it is meaningful to assert that the currents associated

to the ns-ns sublattice have level q1 and those associated to the r-r sublattice

have level q5. the conformal dimensions of the uncharged part of the operator then

these equations express the fact that some of the excitation energy must be expended

on excitations that carry the 16 vector charges.

s = 2(cid:16)qclhirr

r /6(cid:17) .

(33)

this is a prediction for the area of a black hole with the prescribed set of charges.

it would be cumbersome to nd such a general solution explicitly but perhaps the

result could be inferred by duality arguments on the supergravity side.

however, in the extreme limit hirr

r = 0 the area formula is known [24]. in this case

the excitation energy can be expressed in terms of the charges as

this agrees with the area formula given in [24] upon specializing the e6(6) invariant
j3 to the case considered here 11.

a special case is p5 = 0, i.e. no momentum owing on the large circle of the
t 5. this is interesting because now there is only momentum (and winding) along

dimensions that are often thought of as dormant; the counting argument nevertheless

works.

in another special case, when the rr-charges vanish, an so(5) invariant

formula is obtained. however, this symmetry is not preserved by the formalism in

intermediate steps.

the entropy of the fundamental string with winding and momentum on t 4 is

analogous to the usual dabholkar-harvey spectrum of perturbative string theory,

11in [24] there is also a microscopic counting; however, the details seem dierent from those given

here.

are present.

5 a fundamental domain for the moduli space

the local geometry of the moduli space of the d1-d5 system is k = so(5, 4)/so(5)
so(4), the subspace of the scalar eld space so(5, 5)/so(5) so(5) of supergravity
on t 4 to which the geometry is attracted in the near-horizon limit. the global iden-

tications of this moduli space are implemented by the elements of so(5, 5; z) which
preserve the background charge vector; these form a subgroup h~q  so(5, 5; z). ele-
ments of so(5, 5; z) not in h~q can be used to map d1- and d5-brane charges (d1, d5)
to the canonical charge vector (n = d1d5, 1), at the expense of mapping the moduli to

exotic values. in other words, one can either impose conditions such as g6 < 1 and vary

the background charges (d1, d5); or allow general g6, etc., with d5 = 1. we will choose
the latter option. thus, the fundamental domain f = h~q\k of the moduli space
consists of several copies of the domain f0 = so(5, 4; z)\so(5, 4)/so(5)  so(4),
and we will roughly be able to associate particular copies of f0  f with particular
values of (d1, d5).

the structure of the global identications on moduli space h~q  so(5, 5; z) is
illuminated by considering particular so(2, 2; z) = sl(2, z)l sl(2, z)r subgroups
of the so(5, 5; z) u-duality group of compactication on t 4. such subgroups are

large enough to accomplish the transformation of the background charges to the

canonical charge vector, and have a simple matrix realization. a convenient choice
involves sl(2, z)r acting on  =  + ig1
iib in d=10); and the sl(2, z)l acting on  = a4 + iv4g1

s generated by t1234st1234
and integer shifts of a4. it is easy to check that these two sl(2, z)s commute. in the

(i.e. the usual sl(2, z) symmetry of type

s

explicit computations, we will only track the dependence on these moduli; however,

the general case is discussed at the end.

let us represent the relevant charges by the matrix

for example, the bps tension formula for the quartet of charges in q can be written

in terms of so(2,2) invariants as

= tr[et qt qt] + 2det[q] .

the xed scalars of the near-horizon limit are obtained by varying this expression

with respect to the real and imaginary parts of  and  ; at the extremum two of

the four parameters will be xed. for instance, if there are only d-brane charges,

then a4 = d1/d5, v4/gs = d1/d5gs; in other words,  =  d1/d5. if we have only
ns charges, then   = f1/n5. these relations are special cases of the xed scalar
conditions (11-12) and (16-17), respectively. they show how the moduli space can

be parametrized after xing the scalars by a single complex parameter that can be

chosen as  .

the so(2, 2; z) group we have isolated generally changes the values of the brane

charges, keeping only the inner product det[q] invariant. among the transformations

are some that can be used to map d1-d5 charges (d1, d5) to the canonical background

(d1d5, 1), while maintaining f1 = n5 = 0; they are

gl =   a d5 b d1
d ! ,
c
gr =   a
c d1 d d5!

,

ad d5  bc d1 = 1 .

(43)

solutions to this equation exist when (and only when) d1 and d5 are mutually prime;

they can be chosen to have c = d = 1. some freedom remains, because the matrices

gl =     d1d5





! ,

17

gr =   

 d1d5



!

,

  d1d5 = 1 ,

(44)

preserve the charge vector (d1d5, 1), and can be used after the canonical transforma-

tion (43) to do further shifts. equation (44) denes the congruence subgroup 0(d1d5)

of sl(2, z). the transformations (43) that satisfy c = d = 1 are unique for relatively

prime (d1, d5), modulo the 0(d1d5) transformations (44). this shows that (d1, d5)

appear precisely once as the image of the canonical charge (d1d5, 1) under sl(2, z)

transformations modulo 0(d1d5).

now consider the fundamental domain of the residual transformations (44); this

will be the main ingredient of a specication of a fundamental domain for the moduli

space of the spacetime cft. let us again start with non-canonical brane charges

(d1, d5). the singular locus, where the coulomb branch is degenerate with the higgs

branch and we expect some sort of pathology in the cft, is  = 0; in other words 

is purely imaginary. we can use (43) to map the singular domain  = 0 for charges

(d1, d5) into the fundamental domain for the canonical charges (d1d5, 1); this takes

the modulus  = it to

where a, b are the parameters of the transformation (43) (with c = d = 1).12 the

parameter t is the single remaining real modulus of the four in  ,   two have been

eliminated by going to the near-horizon limit, and one by going to the singular locus
of the cft.13 since the map of  is in sl(2, z), the singular line  = 0 for charges
(d1, d5) is mapped under (43) to a semicircle centered on the real axis; its endpoints

are at b/d5 and a/d1. as explained in the introduction, the singular loci for various

d1, d5 with xed n = d1d5 have physically distinct spacetime interpretations as the

12note that the residual transformations (44) include elements that shifts  by integers (keeping

gs xed), so if  

1 is greater than one, we can shift it back into the fundamental domain.

13the string coupling g6 (g2

6 = 2 2) determined from (45) is always larger than one after we have

done the transformation; there does not appear to be any residual transformation that changes this.

charge assignments other than the canonical one therefore always correspond to strongly coupled

regions of moduli space.

18

places in moduli space where the spacetime cft can break up into its constituent

d-branes; for instance, d1 fractional instantons might recombine into a d-string that
leaves the system by moving onto the near-horizon coulomb branch.14 therefore the

dierent semicircular arcs for various d1, d5 = n/d1 correspond to dierent parts of

the fundamental domain that are not identied by the duality group. indeed, they

are not identied under any action of 0(n). a picture of the fundamental domain

for n = 6 is shown in figure 1.

thus, the residual transformations preserving the d1-d5 charge vector (n, 1)

and lying in the particular so(2, 2; z) subgroup of u-duality is a certain diagonal

0(n). the index of 0(n) in  = sl(2, z) (the number of copies of the sl(2, z)

fundamental domain in a fundamental domain of 0(n)) is [26]

( : 0(n)) = n yp|n

p prime

(1 + p1) .

(46)

the number of inequivalent rational cusps in the fundamental domain (i.e. sl(2, z)
images of  = i that are not equivalent under 0(n)) is [26]

(n) =xq|n

(gcd(q, n/q)) ,

where (n) is the euler function

(n) = n yp|n

(47)

(48)

we specialize to the case where the prime decomposition of n contains no prime factor

with multiplicity more than one; this guarantees that any partition of n = d1d5 into

(d1 = q, d5 = n/q) is such that d1 and d5 are relatively prime, so that the brane

system is conned to the higgs branch for generic moduli (the extension to general

14it is often said that the coulomb and higgs branches of the eld space decouple in the low-energy

limit of the brane dynamics; however, since the eective eld theory that describes the singularity of

the higgs branch [23, 12] is written in terms of a vector multiplet describing the transverse separation

of branes, one might say that the higgs branch is joined smoothly onto the near-horizon region of

the coulomb branch. similar phenomena occur in the parametrization of the large-n solution of the

adhm equations [25], where the scale size of instantons inside a stack of d3-branes is isomorphic

to the transverse separation of d-instantons from the d3-branes, provided that separation is scaled

to remain nite in the maldacena limit. we thank a. strominger for discussions of this issue.

boundary segments are identied under elements of 0(6) (in this example, the identied

segments are symmetric about the imaginary axis). heavy dashed lines denote the subspaces
where the spacetime cft becomes singular.the line from  = 0 to i is the singular
locus for (d1, d5) = (1, 6) or (6, 1), with the lower end corresponding to the former charge

assignment and the upper end corresponding to the latter. similarly, the circular arc from

cusp corresponds to a dierent weak-coupling limit of the spacetime cft.

20

n is certainly of interest but lies outside the scope of the present work). in this case

(n) is simply the number of divisors of n, i.e. precisely the number of ways of

partitioning n into two factors (d1, d5). the cusps of the fundamental domain are

simply those that contain the two ends of the arcs (45) for the various partitions

(d1, d5). the charges (d1, d5) and (d5, d1) are interchanged by the transformation
  1/ and   1/ . hence the segment 1 < t <  of the arc (45) can be
assigned to the former charges, and the segment 0 < t < 1 to the latter charges.
moreover, d5 copies of the sl(2, z) fundamental domain meet at the cusp at t = 
along this arc, and d1 copies meet at the t = 0 cusp at the other end of the arc (see

figure 1); this reects the periodicity of  in the respective original u-duality frames,

before the map to canonical charges (n, 1). the cusps are the large volume limits
of the torus v4/gs  , before the transformation (43) to the canonical frame, for
dierent pairs of charges (d1 = q, d5 = n/q); we see there is precisely one for each

charge assignment. each large volume limit is a dierent weak coupling limit for the

dual cft. the dierent limits are connected through regions of strong coupling. the

fundamental domain of 0(n) contains all of the structure needed to describe the

dierent d1-d5 bound states in the context of a single connected moduli space.

to summarize, we have completely and explicitly characterized the moduli space

and its singular locus. with only the moduli gs, v4/gs, , and a4 activated, the

singular locus is given by the arcs (45); we can then switch on all the other moduli

while preserving the xed scalar conditions (10-12). each arc in the  -plane funda-

mental domain of 0(n) gives a single connected component of the singular locus,

of codimension four in the full moduli space. in particular, there are only as many

disconnected components of the singular locus as there are partitions of n into un-

ordered pairs (d1, d5) (for the class of examples considered here). all weak-coupling

regions of the cft other than that for d1 = n occur along the real axis of  ; these

will be small-volume limits in the target space of the symmetric product (see section

6).

up to this point we have focussed on the moduli  =  + i/gs and  = a4 +
iv4/gs in the map to the canonical background, by taking b+ = 0. however, the

disjoint (disconnected) nature of the singular loci for dierent (d1, d5) is a property

of generic moduli. the simplest argument leading to this conclusion proceeds in the

21

f1/ns5 duality frame. we consider a singular locus which is a transformation to the
canonical frame of the point  = c + = 0 in the background (f1, n5); and another

background (f 

singular locus which is the analogous transformation to the canonical frame from the
1 6= n5). we want to determine whether
these two co-dimension four surfaces intersect. assume that they do, and pull some

5) (with f1n5 = f

5 and f 

point on the intersection back to the original frame using the maps corresponding

to the two inequivalent interpretations; this gives two points on the original singular
surface corresponding to the charges (f1, n5) and (f 
5). this surface has  =
c + = 0 so, after taking the xed scalar conditions in to account, it is parametrized

1, n

by the standard moduli gij + bij (and g6); it is left invariant only by standard t-
duality transformations. however, this is a contradiction: (f1, n5) and (f 

5) are not
equivalent under t-duality. we conclude that the singular surfaces do not intersect.

1, n

the case of general moduli can also be analyzed from a dierent point of view.
after the map to the canonical frame with charges (d1d5, 1), the group h~q preserving
the background tensor charge vector ~q is generated by two canonical subgroups: (i)

the further 0(n) transformations (44); and (ii) transformations sts, where s is

type iib s-duality, and t is an element of the so(4, 4; z) t-duality group. in other

words, any element can be described via its action on the vectors of the charge lattice,

and we can use t-duality to rotate a given vector into some sublattice acted on by

an so(2, 2; z) subgroup that mixes it with (d1, d5). the allowed transformations in

this so(2, 2; z) subgroup are the image of 0(n) under the t-duality map.

the puzzles concerning the level of the current algebras, discussed heuristically

in section 2, can be explained in detail using the picture developed in this section.

the point is that the concept of level is meaningful only on the singular loci, where

the simple formula (5) for the energy of vector excitations applies. even with this re-

striction, the values of the levels are ambiguous: they are covariant under so(5, 4; z)

transformations so their values (q1 and q5) are those of the specic singular locus.

more importantly, since the dierent singular loci are continuously related through

the bulk of moduli space the levels are indeterminate at generic points in moduli

space.

the above analysis of the global structure of the d1-d5 moduli space carries

over without signicant modication to the case of compactication on k3; in the

22

generators of h~q discussed above, one simply replaces the so(4, 4; z) t-duality group
in transformations of type (ii) by the so(4, 20; z) t-duality group of k3.

6 comparison with the symmetric orbifold cft

the analysis of the u(1) mass formula gives a great deal of robust, nontopological data

about the spacetime cft. this data can be used to pin down the relation between the
symmetric orbifold cft symn (x 4) and the spacetime cft dual to ads3  s3  x 4.
the points of comparison of this cft with the data of the spacetime cft of the

d1-d5 system consist of

 the spectrum of bps states;
 the qualitative density of states in the vicinity of the orbifold locus;
 the moduli-dependent u(1)16 mass formula.

in this section, we analyze these data in turn.

first, we review the spectrum of half-bps states of the symmetric orbifold con-

formal eld theory; it matches several previous investigations of this spectrum [13,

14, 27, 28].15 as argued by vafa [13] the half-bps spectrum of the d1-d5 system is

expected to match that of a fundamental string with winding and momentum charges

(the so-called dabholkar-harvey spectrum). this relation is most easily seen [15] via

the chain of dualities involved in maintaining a proper low-energy description of the

near-horizon region as one passes to the core of the geometry; these dualities map

d1/d5 charge to momentum/fundamental string winding charge.

in addition, we

will nd a direct map between the bps chiral vertex operators of the symmetric

orbifold, and those constructed in a perturbative string approach [30, 18]; the lat-

ter, however, do not cover the full bps spectrum, as explained in [12]. the precise

match of the symmetric orbifold bps spectrum (including the cuto in r-charge at

j = d1d5/2) limits ones ability to tinker with this cft and still match the structure

of the unadulterated d1-d5 system.

15the discussion corrects several errors in [29].

23

the bps spectrum is topological data, and as such does not help us discover where

the symmetric orbifold lies in the moduli space analyzed in previous sections. the

fact that it contains a u(1)4
r current algebra of level n = d1d5 suggests it is
somewhere in the  = i cusp of the fundamental domain (c.f. figure 1), according
to the discussion of section 5. further support for this idea comes from consideration

l  u(1)4

of the non-bps spectrum. an estimate [16] of this spectrum yields hagedorn growth
s  e in the neighborhood of the orbifold locus. this estimate is also consistent
with q5 = 1.

finally, we come to the spectrum of u(1)16 charged states. we nd a slight

modication of the symmetric orbifold which precisely agrees with the formula for
vector masses at  = 1

2 and b = 0, and identify the perturbations away from the

orbifold point in the moduli space.

of cycles, each of which is a cyclic permutation of copies of x 4. the twist operator

for a single cycle is the analogue of a single-trace operator in the 3+1d superyang-
mills/ads5  s5 duality  in other words, it is the representation of a single-particle
operator.16 twist operators for words that are products of cycles are multiparticle

operators; their structure is determined combinatorically, and obeys the upper cuto
j  n/2 of the allowed r-charges (since a word in sn always has length less than or
equal to n). thus we need only consider the twist operators for cycles, namely the

twists corresponding to

(x 4)k/zk .

(49)

16more precisely, it is the leading term in such an operator; there could be a nontrivial, nonlinear

map between the boundary operator algebra of supergravity and that of the cft, similar to that

seen in solvable models [31]. indeed, we will argue below that the modulus of the cft corresponding

to the rr scalar has a component which is not a single-particle operator as dened here.

diagonalize the action of the twist (similarly ,  diagonalize twists for , ). the

operator which creates the twist ground state from the sl(2)-invariant cft vacuum
is the product of the (/k) twist operators for each x (),  = 1, ..., k  1 (and their
fermionic partners). these component twist operators have conformal dimension
 = (k  )/k2 from the operator that twists the bosons, and  = (/k)2 from the
fermions; combining all the twists, the total dimension is

zk twist = 1

2 (k  1) .

(51)

since the dimension equals the r-charge, the operator is bps. we will denote the

chiral part of the resulting operator 1k1, exhibiting its left-handed su(2) r-
symmetry transformation as a spin 1
2(k  1) representation. the right-handed chiral
vertex operator is similarly  1 k1.

details for x 4 = t 4: the highest weight n = (4, 4) vertex operators that create
single-particle bps states are then built out of the twist operator  , together with
the diagonal fermions (0), (0) which are invariant under the twist; one simply uses

these ingredients to build operators whose dimension is equal to their su(2) spin.

time cft [12], the set of chiral operators realized there is smaller than that of the

the sixteen operators p,q, p,q ll out the hodge diamond h p,q of t 4 [14, 27, 28], with

eight odd elements corresponding to fermions and eight even elements corresponding

to bosons.

finally, the proper description of the cft for x 4 = t 4 includes an additional
four-torus t 4 current algebra. the bps spectrum of this extra t 4 consists of 1, ,
, 
; the counting of these latter states is again that of the four-torus cohomology,
and is isomorphic to the set of chiral ground states of the superstring. without this

extra contribution, one would not reproduce the correct degeneracy of bps states.

the counting of multiparticle bps states matches that of the chiral spectrum of the

superstring, since the basic operators (52),(53) are isomorphic to the chiral oscillator

spectrum of the superstring, and the multiparticle states are the fock space of the

single-particle spectrum.17 all told, the bps spectrum is that of the (dabholkar-

harvey) bps states of a single superstring  the 16 bps states from the extra t 4

supplies the degeneracy of the left-moving ground states, and the symmetric product

gives the same counting as the left-moving oscillator states at level n = d1d5; the
global n = (4, 4) descendants supply an extra factor of 16, representing the right-
moving ground state degeneracy.

17for a given element of sn , each component t 4 belongs to some cycle (possibly trivial) of the

permutation, hence to some oscillator creation operator; the total number of component t 4s denes

the total oscillator level of the chiral oscillator spectrum.

26

details for x 4 = k3: the situation for x 4 = k3 is similar. one has exactly the
same twist operators    for k-cycles, which can be tensored with any of the 24
chiral primaries from the diagonal copy of k3 in k3k/zk; thus the structure is that

of the chiral oscillators of the bosonic string. in this case all d1d5 + 1 copies of k3 are

involved in the symmetric orbifold. there is no extra degeneracy of bps states from

some other component of the cft, analogous to the extra t 4 in the previous example;

this matches onto the uniqueness of the ground state of the bosonic string. also, the

additional copy of k3 in the symmetric product means that the degeneracy of bps

states will be that of the bosonic string at level n = d1d5 + 1, matching the shift

by one in ground state energy. finally, taking into account the 16-fold degeneracy of
the n = (4, 4) short multiplet gives the dabholkar-harvey spectrum of the heterotic
string, as expected [13, 15]. the moduli involve the usual 20 hypermultiplets of the

base k3, together with the further blowup hypermultiplet (described below for the
torus case); together they parametrize the so(4, 21)/so(4)  so(21) teichmuller
moduli space.

non bps states: a simple argument [16] shows that the full density of (generi-

cally non-bps) ns-sector states of the symmetric orbifold is of a stringy nature, not
characteristic of low-energy supergravity on ads3  s3  x 4. the kth twisted sector
has oscillators with moding 1/k; the energy cost to reach this sector is r5e  o(k)
(see (51)). thus the total density of states is approximately

(e) 

min (d1d5,r5e)xk=1

k exph0qk(r5e  k)i ,

(54)

for some constants 0, k. for a given r5e < d1d5, the value of k that dominates the
density of states is o(r5e/2), thus (e)  exp[0r5e/2] is a hagedorn spectrum.
this spectrum turns over to the exp[2d1d5e] growth required of a cft with
central charge c = 6d1d5 above the characteristic energy scale r5e  d1d5. because
the low-energy spectrum has string-theoretic rather than eld-theoretic growth, the

symmetric orbifold must describe a regime where there is a string in the theory whose

tension is of order the ads radius of curvature, so that the spacetime does not have

a supergravity interpretation. it is not dicult to identify the culprit: in the d1-

27

d5 background, the ads radius in units of the d-string tension is d5,18 so that
when d5 = 1 the spacetime seen by this object has stringy curvature. one has to

make sure that the spacetime is of low curvature with respect to all strings present

in the spectrum. as is standard in decoupling limits, the region of the moduli space

corresponding to spacetimes with a valid low-energy supergravity description is a

strongly-coupled region of the dual quantum eld theory. we take the qualitative

agreement of the full spectrum of the symmetric orbifold with that expected for

d5 = 1 as further evidence for the identication of the orbifold locus with a part of

the d5 = 1 region of the moduli space of the spacetime cft.

6.2 dependence on moduli

r of the symmetric orbifold symn (t 4) is at level n = d1d5, while
the u(1)4
that of t 4 is at level one. this suggests that this cft describes some part of the

l  u(1)4

corresponding region of the spacetime cft, where the u(1) spectrum separates into
two pieces with corresponding levels  in other words, the   i cusp of the
fundamental domain in the canonical presentation of section 5. we now provide

further evidence in support of this proposal, by checking that the dependence on all

the moduli is consistent with this identication.

the moduli space of the symn (t 4) theory includes the 16 narain moduli

mij = i

a aj

(55)

of the q1q5 copies of t 4 in the symmetric product, as well as the four blowup modes

of the z2 twist in sq1q5; near the orbifold point, the corresponding operators are the

descendants

mab = ga

(56)

of the z2 twist highest weight. in addition to these 20 moduli parametrizing k =
so(5, 4)/so(5)so(4), there are the u(1) current perturbations jij j, fjij j, jifj j,
and fjifj j, where ji, j i are the eight diagonal u(1) currents of (t 4)n ; and fji, fj i are

the u(1) currents of the t 4. one issue we will have to address is precisely how the

moduli space of the spacetime theory sits inside this 84-dimensional moduli space.

18this is just the s-dual of a corresponding statement in f1-ns5 backgrounds, where the ads

radius in units of the f1-string scale is n5.

28

to begin, let us turn o the self-dual ns b-eld moduli in the u(1) spectrum

the so(4, 4)/so(4)so(4) moduli parametrized by g6, g, and cij appear dierently
in the two square brackets. this is because the eight u(1) charges (pi, wi
d1) transform
in the vector of the associated so(4, 4; z) t-duality group, while the eight charges

(wi

f 1, wd3

i

) transform in a spinor representation (the two are related by triality in

6

so(4,4)). in terms of this data, we identify the moduli of the tori in the symmetric
gij and an antisymmetric tensor cij, whereas the moduli of
orbifold as a metric g1
the extra t 4 are a metric g1
gij and an antisymmetric tensor c ij = ijklckj. note
6
also that, even though wi
f 1 has a contravariant index, it should be thought of as a
momentum charge on t 4 for the present purpose, since it is this quantity that is
shifted by the t 4 winding wd3

in the presence of a nontrivial antisymmetric tensor

i

background.

having found the embedding of the so(4, 4)/so(4) so(4) moduli of the space-
time cft in that of the (so(4, 4)/so(4)  so(4))2 moduli space of tori of the
symn (t 4)  t 4 cft, we can account for the  dependence as follows. from the
way it appears in (57), part of the perturbation corresponding to  should be an-
other antisymmetric tensor modulus of symn (t 4)  t 4 since it couples in the same
way; however, since it couples the momentum of symn (t 4) to the winding on t 4 and

vice-versa, it must involve an antisymmetric perturbation that mixes the two factors.

the fact that the orbifold is parity symmetric means that it can only describe  = 0
2 in the moduli space [22]. however,  = 0 is a singular cft, leaving  = 1
or  = 1
2
as the only candidate. thus we should modify the orbifold to include an asymmetric

shift by half a lattice vector coupling ji and fji. note that this asymmetric shift

on the t 4 onto each copy of t 4 in the symmetric product,

will copy the winding wd3

i

29

accounting for the relative factor of n in shift of the momenta in the rst term of

(57). the asymmetric shift amounts to turning on a term

bb

cm =(cid:16)j a afj

(58)

in the action of the sigma model on symn (t 4)  t 4. however, the vertex operator
corresponding to the modulus  cannot consist solely of cm, since deforming the
orbifold to  = 0 would not result in a singular cft. this job is accomplished by
the scalar z2 blowup mode abmab (56), which also has the right quantum numbers
to be part of the modulus . moreover, it is the operator that shifts the theta angle

in the symmetric orbifold sigma model; turning it on by half a unit tunes the theta

angle to zero, resulting in the singular cft expected at  = 0. thus the dependence

of the spacetime cft on the modulus  is carried by several dierent parts of the

symmetric orbifold  the blowup modulus accounts for the singularity encountered

charges as a function of . the correct perturbation away from the orbifold point is

at  = 0, while the current-current perturbation cm takes care of the mixing of u(1)
  ( cm + abmab).

the analysis for the other three blowup moduli (self-dual ns two-forms in the

present duality frame) is similar, but complicated by the fact that these perturbations

enter as metric deformations in the u(1) mass formula.

it is not too hard to check that, to lowest order, the eect on the symmetric product is
n times that on the extra t 4, just as for the  perturbation. in any case, these moduli

are turned o at the orbifold locus (otherwise, they would break various discrete
symmetries). the perturbation away from the orbifold locus is  ~b+  ( ~m + ~abmab).
to summarize, we propose that the orbifold symn (t 4) t 4, where the semi-direct
product is meant to indicate the additional asymmetric shift coupling the two factors,
describes the line  = 1
2 in the d1-d5 moduli space in the canonical duality frame of
section 5. moving in the moduli subspace parametrized by  and g6 = gs/n , we

30

should encounter the singularities corresponding to all other partitions of n. these

loci depend separately on d1 and d5, and we get a dierent singular locus in the

moduli space of the symmetric product, for each possible partition of the product
n = d1d5 into two factors. all the other singularities are at small volume of the t 4,

with order one amount of the blowup modulus turned on; thus the sigma model is

strongly coupled.

it would be interesting to understand what phenomenon in the cft distinguishes

the singular domains; it is natural to speculate that there is a singularity in the sigma

model target space in which d5 fractional instantons come together to make a d1-

brane or d5-brane that leaves the system, and that this phenomenon is related to the
denominators of the rational cusps of the fundamental domain  i.e. that   a/d1
or   b/d5 (in the notation of section (5)). perhaps these are relics of the d1- or
d5-twisted sectors of the orbifold, since the fractional instantons at the orbifold point
are the elds parametrizing the component copies of t 4; and it is these twist operators

that sew together the proper number of fractional instantons of the orbifold theory

to reconstitute a string that can leave the system. it is hard to be precise, however,

since the orbifold point is far in the moduli space from the singular loci.

6.3 other orbifolds

adding kk monopoles: in [18], the gks formalism was extended to the n =
(4, 0) scft obtained when one introduces kaluza-klein monopoles into the brane

background, after compactication on an additional circle. the moduli space of the
iib theory on t 5 is e6(6)/usp(8), which is restricted to f4(4)/su(2) usp(6) by the
xed scalar mechanism. analogous to the d1-d5 system without the kk monopole,

the group of discrete identications of the moduli space is the subgroup of e6(6)(z)

that xes the background charges. it would be interesting to give a more explicit char-

acterization of it, along the lines of the present discussion for the d1-d5 background.

in the symmetric orbifold cft, the addition of p kk monopoles to the background

involves an asymmetric orbifold that acts as a zp twist of the right-moving su(2)

r-symmetry [18, 32]. this twist breaks the right-moving supersymmetry completely,

consequently there will be additional moduli which involve lowest components of su-

perelds from the untwisted sector (one can check that no new moduli arise from

31

twisted sectors of the zp orbifold). near the orbifold point, the additional moduli are

generated by the vertex operators

ma a 5 = ya a j3 ,

(here j3 is the r-current left unbroken by the zp action), and by

  .

it is not dicult to check that these operators have no three-point function with

themselves, the t 4 moduli, or the blowup modes (56), and are thus moduli (this

should be a sucient condition given (4, 0) supersymmetry). they also have the
right spacetime quantum numbers under both lorentz and su(2)  usp(6) trans-
formations. specically, the moduli transform as the (2, 14) under this group, which
decomposes as a (2, 1, 4) (2, 2, 5) under the manifest su(2) su(2) so(5) of the
orbifold cft (the su(2)  su(2) transforms the left-movers of the cft, the so(5)
the right-movers); the (2,2,5) consist of the moduli from the untwisted sector, and

the (2,1,4) are the eight moduli (56),(61) coming from the z2 twisted sector of the

symmetric orbifold.

one can again carry out the scaling analysis of section 2. the type iib theory is

now compactied on t 6, with one circle kept large and the rest having sizes of order

the string scale. there is a background of three of the 27 available tensor charges

turned on, which we have taken to consist of p kk monopoles, q5 d5-branes, and

q1 d-strings. the background naturally distinguishes one of the ve small circles

as the nontrivial ber of the kk monopole; the remaining four are isomorphic to

the t 4 that the d1-d5 system is compactied on. the vector excitations about the

background form a 27 of the e6(6) duality group of the small t 5: (cid:16)5

3(cid:17) = 10 d3-branes,

5 d1-branes, 5 fundamental strings, 5 kk-momenta, one wrapped d5-brane, and one

wrapped ns5-brane. these naturally decompose as 8v + 8s + 8c + 1 + 1 + 1 under the

so(4, 4) t-duality group of the t 4. one nds a structure reminiscent of (5), with
three separate t 4 current algebras of levels q1, q5, and p; and an interesting triality

symmetry among the terms. we hope to give further details elsewhere.

orientifolds: one can also consider the d1-d5 system in the presence of an

orientifold plane. in this case, the orientifold projection eliminates the rr scalar and

32

the four-form a4, as well as the ns b-eld. therefore, the so(5, 4)/so(5)  so(4)
near-horizon moduli space will be reduced to so(4, 4)/so(4) so(4); the rr scalar
will be frozen to either  = 0 or  = 1
2 for any given values of d1 and d5. in partic-
ular, the moduli that enabled us to move between the various domains associated to

dierent one-brane and ve-brane charges for xed n = d1d5 are projected out. any

orbifold conformal eld theory that describes such a situation then has no analogues
of the twisted sector moduli mab; the orbifold moduli space will then only describe
d1 = 1 or d5 = 1.

a general analysis of d5-branes in the presence of orientifold 5-planes was per-

formed in [33, 34, 35]. there are two types of orientifold that x  = 0 and two
that x  = 1

2; only the latter are expected to lead to nonsingular dual cfts when

d1-branes are added and the scaling limit is taken. these are

 an o5-plane of so-type (d5-brane charge -1) with an odd number of 5-branes,

yielding gauge group so(2k + 1);

 an o5-plane of sp-type (d5-brane charge +2) with an even number of d5-

branes, giving sp(2k) gauge group.

one might therefore expect that there is an appropriate modication of the sym-

metric orbifold that generates the moduli space of a single so(2k + 1) or sp(2k) in-

stanton on t 4 or k3. the dimension of the moduli space of n instantons in so(2k+1)
or sp(2k) gauge theory on t 4 or k3 is 4[2k(n k) k], leading one to expect a cft
of central charge c = 6[2d1d5  d5], in particular one has c = 6d5 when d1 = 1. the
orientifold will eliminate all half-integer spin representations of r-symmetry from the
half-bps spectrum. it is this projection that removes the twisted moduli mab (56)
related to  and b+, pinning the orbifold at  = 1
2. since the projection eliminates
the gauge elds that carry fundamental string and d3-brane ux, when x 4 = t 4,

only the u(1) charges associated to momenta and wrapped d1-branes survive.

a derivation of a bps formula

the mass formulae of interest are bps formulae, and hence direct consequences of

supersymmetry. bps masses are derived by solving appropriate eigenvalue prob-

lems. the details of this strategy as well as original references can be found in the

review [21].

the simplest starting point is the expression for the supersymmetry algebra in

m-theory.

the central charges zm n and zm n p qr are m2- and m5-brane charges, respectively,

and the pm are the momenta; in particular p0 is the mass m that we want to compute.

in this appendix we consider a f1/ns5 background and excitations with arbitrary

vector charges. our charge assignments are type iib but transformation to m-theory

is simple; this leads to the eigenvalue equation

s. note that this simple expression is the result of numerous cancellations
between the vector terms and the tensor-vector interactions. at this point the eigen-

value equation is solved by taking 11 = 1 (this is legitimate because it commutes

with 1234 = 1). taking the square root again gives

the excitation energy can now be read o as the energy above the background mass.

here it is understood that gij (contracting pi, wd3

are measured in units of ls. the nal equation (72) is identical to (21), except that

the sign of ~wd3 has been changed. this is purely a matter of conventions.

two renements of these results are needed for the entropy computation in section

4. first, it is straightforward to generalize the computation in this appendix by

including also the scalar charge p5, i.e. the momentum along the background f 1.

the result is simply that p5 can be added on the right-hand side of (72), without

any further cross-terms. next, the mass computed here is the largest eigenvalue of

the central charge matrix. the computation also identies the smaller eigenvalue: it
is found by choosing instead 11 = 1 after (70). this results in the opposite signs
within the absolute squares in (72). this justies the smaller conformal weight (hl)

used in section 4.
