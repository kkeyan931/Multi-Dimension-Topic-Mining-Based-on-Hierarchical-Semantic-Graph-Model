abstract

a class of conformally at and asymptotically anti-de sitter geometries involving proles

of scalar elds is studied from the point of view of gauged supergravity. the scalars involved

in the solutions parameterise the sl(n, ir)/so(n ) submanifold of the full scalar coset

of the gauged supergravity, and are described by a symmetric potential with a universal

form. these geometries descend via consistent truncation from distributions of d3-branes,

m2-branes, or m5-branes in ten or eleven dimensions. we exhibit analogous solutions

asymptotic to ads6 which descend from the d4-d8-brane system. we obtain the related

six-dimensional theory by consistent reduction from massive type iia supergravity. all

our geometries correspond to states in the coulomb branch of the dual conformal eld

theories. we analyze linear uctuations of minimally coupled scalars and nd both discrete

and continuous spectra, but always bounded below.

introduction

the ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3] oers the possibility of extracting information about

gauge theory in a strongly coupled limit from a dual supergravity description. much recent

work (see for instance [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]) has been devoted to bulk geometries that are only

asymptotically anti-de sitter and retain poincare invariance in the boundary directions.

such geometries correspond either to a relevant deformation of the conformal eld theory

or a state of the conformal eld theory with a vev which sets an energy scale. the

geometries arise from solving a system of scalars coupled to gravity. at the linearized level,

the second order scalar equations admit two linearly independent solutions. modulo the

subtleties discussed in [9], a bulk geometry corresponds to a deformation of the conformal

eld theory if the scalar proles approach the more singular of the two possible linearized

solutions near the boundary, and it corresponds to a state of the conformal eld theory if

they approach the less singular solutions.

we shall be concerned in this paper with fairly broad class of asymptotically anti-de

sitter solutions which can nevertheless be obtained in closed form. these geometries lift to

solutions of ten or eleven-dimensional supergravity describing some distribution of parallel

d3-branes, m2-branes, or m5-branes. they all preserve one half of supersymmetry, and

they are states of the dual conformal eld theories: the vevs in question are simply the

positions of the branes in the distribution.

these geometries are interesting for several reasons. first, a subset of them arise as limits

of charged black holes in anti-de sitter space. the limit in question leads (generically) to a

naked timelike singularity. when the asymptotically anti-de sitter solution is lifted to ten or

eleven dimensions, the only singularities are due to the fact that the branes are distributed

continuously. they are naked null singularities similar to those around low-dimensional

d-branes.

second, the geometries provide examples of consistent truncation in various dimensions.

the explicit embedding of lower dimensional gauged supergravities in higher dimensions has

been worked out only for a handful of cases, namely n = 2 (maximal) and n = 1 gauged
d = 7 supergravity as s4 reductions from d = 11 [10, 11], and d = 6 gauged n = 2
supergravity as as a warped s4 reduction from massive type iia supergravity [12]. (for
the s7 reduction of d = 11 supergravity, the results of [13, 14] are complete in principle

but very implicit in form.) consistent embeddings in d = 11 and d = 10 type iib for the
gauged supergravities with the maximal abelian subgroups u (1)4, u (1)2 and u (1)3 of the
so(8), so(5) and so(6) gauge groups from the maximal s7, s4 and s5 reductions have

2

also been constructed, in [15]. it is therefore of interest in the ongoing study of consistent

truncations to have further examples of some generality.

some of the geometries we consider appeared in [16, 17], and a set of representative

examples was studied in [7]. in [7] the curious result was obtained that some of the asymp-

totically anti-de sitter geometries lifted to distributions of branes of indenite sign: that

is, there were branes of negative charge and negative tension present in the distribution.

negative charge and positive tension would indicate an anti-brane. but negative charge and

negative tension, in the absence of some orientifolding, is pathological. for instance, the

transverse uctuations of such branes would have negative kinetic terms. yet the asymp-

totically anti-de sitter geometries that lead to these disallowed brane distributions are no

more pathological than those where the brane distribution is strictly positive.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we describe the interacting scalars which

participate in the conformally at and asymptotically anti-de sitter geometries. because

of the similarities of these geometries with supergravity domain wall solutions (see for

example [19]), we will often refer to them as anti-de sitter domain walls. in section 3 we

explain the ten and eleven dimensional origin of the geometries. in section 4 we describe

explicitly the brane distributions corresponding to each type of domain wall. in section 5,

we consider asymptotically ads6 geometries which arise from many d4-branes distributed

inside coincident d8-branes. we will see that d3-branes, m2-branes, and m5-branes behave

quite similarly in their respective dimensions, and the geometries and distributions can be

described very much in parallel. the d4-d8-brane solutions are rather dierent and provide

another interesting example of consistent truncation. finally, in section 6, we analyze

the spectrum of minimally coupled scalars in the various domain wall geometries we have

constructed.

2 symmetric potentials in gauged supergravities,

and domain-wall solutions

in this section, we consider the structure of the scalar potentials that arise in the maximally-

supersymmetric gauged supergravities in d = 4, 5 and 7 dimensions. we shall present the

results in a slightly more general framework for arbitrary dimension d, although in the end

we shall see that d = 4, 5 and 7 are singled out.

3

2.1 symmetric potentials

the scalar elds in d-dimensional maximal supergravity parameterize the coset e11d/k,

where en is the maximally-non-compact form of the exceptional group en, and k is its
maximal compact subgroup.1 we can focus on the sl(n, ir) subgroup of en, and consider
in particular the subset of 1
2 n (n +1)1 scalars parameterizing the coset sl(n, ir)/so(n ).
(in d = 4 and d = 5, the relevant subgroups of e7 and e6 are sl(8, ir) and sl(6, ir). in

d = 7, the group e4 is itself just a4, and so we consider sl(5, ir) in that case.)

one can use the local so(n ) transformations in order to diagonalize the scalar poten-

tial. thus we are led to consider the following lagrangian for gravity plus scalars in d

dimensions:

where the potential v is given by

e1 ld = r  1

2 ( ~)2  v ,

v =  1

nxi=1
2 g2(cid:16)(

xi)2  2

nxi=1

x 2

i(cid:17) .

(2.1)

(2.2)

(in d = 4, 5 and 7, we shall have n = 8, 6 and 5 respectively.) the n quantities xi, which

are subject to the constraint

xi = 1 ,

nyi=1

can be parameterized in terms of (n  1) independent dilatonic scalars ~ as follows:

xi = e 1

2

~bi~ ,

(2.3)

(2.4)

where the ~bi are the weight vectors of the fundamental representation of sl(n, ir), satis-
fying

~bi  ~bj = 8ij 

8
n

, xi

~bi = 0 ,

(~u  ~bi)~bi = 8~u ,

(2.5)

where ~u is an arbitrary n -vector. the last equation in (2.5) allows us to express the dilatons

~ in terms of the xi:

4xi
~ =  1

~bi log xi .

(2.6)

note that the potential has a minimum at xi = 1 for n  3, a point of inection at xi = 1
for n = 4, and a maximum at xi = 1 for n  5.

the equations of motion for the scalar elds, following from (2.1), are

1as usual, we dene e5  d5, e4  a4, e3  a2  a1, e2  a1  ir and e1  ir.

from (2.4) it follows that xi/ ~ =  1
become
2 g2 xi

note that we can also write the scalar equations of motion as

i  xi xj

(2.9)

xj)2(cid:17) .

(the last two terms on the right-hand side imply that the sum over i is zero, as it must be

since the n quantities xi satisfy (2.3).)

in order to make contact with previous results, we can verify that if the potential (2.2) is

specialized to the case where as many pairs of the quantities xi as possible are set equal, we

recover the previously-known potentials that arise when the various gauged supergravities

are truncated to the multiplets comprising the maximal abelian subgroups of the original

gauge groups. thus for d = 4 we may set the 8 quantities xi pairwise equal,

x1 = x2  ex1 , x3 = x4  ex2 , x5 = x6  ex3 , x7 = x8  ex4 ,

whereupon the potential becomes

(2.10)

(2.11)

v = 4g2 xa<b exa exb ,

where the four exa satisfy qa exa = 1. this potential is the one encountered in [18, 15], for

the scalars in the truncation of four-dimensional gauged so(8) supergravity to its u (1)4

maximal abelian subgroup.

for d = 5, we may set the 6 quantities xi pairwise equal,

x1 = x2  ex1 ,

under which the potential v given in (2.2) reduces to

x3 = x4  ex2 ,
3xa=1 ex 1

a

v = 4g2

x5 = x6  ex3 ,

,

(2.12)

(2.13)

where the three scalar quantities exa satisfy q exa = 1. this potential was encountered in

[20, 15]; it arises in the truncation of the ve-dimensional gauged so(6) supergravity to its
u (1)3 maximal abelian subgroup.

finally, in d = 7 we may set

x1 = x2  ex1 , x3 = x4  ex2 , x5  ex0 .

5

(2.14)

the three exa satisfy ex0 = (ex1 ex2)2, and the potential (2.2) becomes
0 + 8ex1 ex2 + 4ex0 ex1 + 4ex0 ex2) .

2 g2(ex 2

v =  1

this can be recognized as precisely the potential previously encountered in the truncation

(2.15)

of seven-dimensional so(5) gauged supergravity to its u (1)2 maximal abelian subgroup

[15]. it is interesting to observe how the asymmetry between the ex0 eld and the ex1 and
ex2 elds here can be simply understood as originating from the fact that the more general

potential (2.2) has an odd number of elds xi in this case, and so there is inevitably an

odd one out after setting as many pairs as possible equal.

it should be emphasized that in each case, setting pairs of xi equal is consistent with

the equations of motion (2.9).

2.2 ads domain-wall solutions

the equations of motion following from the gravity plus scalar lagrangian (2.1) comprise

the scalar equations (2.8), together with the einstein equation

rm n = 1

2 m ~  n ~ + 1

d2 v gm n .

we nd that these equations admit solutions given by

ds2

d = (g r)

xi = h 1

where

hi = 1 +

2
i
r2 ,

provided that the integer n is related to the spacetime dimension d by

n =

4(d  2)
d  3

.

(2.16)

(2.17)

(2.18)

(2.19)

note that for d = 4, 5 and 7 this indeed implies n = 8, 6 and 5 respectively. as we

explained in the introduction, we shall refer to solutions of this kind as anti-de sitter

domain walls.

in verifying these solutions, it is useful rst to calculate the ricci tensor for the class of

metrics

ds2

d = e2a dx dx + e2b dr2 ,

(2.20)

6

where a and b are functions of r. in the orthonormal basis e = ea dx, er = eb dr, we

nd that the tangent-space components of the ricci tensor are

r = (a + (d  1) a2  a b) e2b  ,
rrr = (d  1) (a + a2  a b) e2b ,

(2.21)

where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to r. thus the einstein equation (2.16)

becomes

 (a + (d  1) a2  a b) e2b =
(d  1)(a + a2  a b) e2b = 1

1
d2 v ,
2 e2b ~  ~ + 1

d2 v .

(2.22)

it is useful also to note that (2.18) implies h 

i = (2/r) (hi  1). substituting into the
einstein and scalar equations of motion, we now straightforwardly verify that (2.17) is a

solution.

it should be noted that the solutions we have obtained here reduce to previously-known
ones in certain special cases. namely, if we make the pairwise identications 2p1 = 2p 
lp for 1  p  n/2 in d = 4 or d = 5, then we obtain solutions with 4 or 3 parameters lp
respectively, which correspond precisely to the extremal bps limits of the 4-charge [18, 15]

and 3-charge ads4 [20] and ads5 black holes of maximal d = 4 and d = 5 supergravity. in
the d = 7 case, if we set 1 = 2  l1, 3 = 4  l2, and 5 = 0, we recover the previously-
known 2-parameter solutions that arise as the extremal bps limits of the 2-charge ads7
black holes [15] of maximal gauged d = 7 supergravity.2

it should be emphasized also that although we naively appear to have n parameters i in
the general solutions (2.17), there are really only (n 1) genuinely independent ones. to see
this, let us suppose, without loss of generality, that 2
n is the smallest of all the parameters,
i.e. 2
n . we also decompose the index i into i = (a, n ), where 1  a  n  1. we now

i  2

make the following coordinate transformation,

and at the same time dene

r2 = r2  2
n ,

straightforward algebra now shows that in terms of these quantities, the metric in the

eha = 1 +

(2.23)

(2.24)

solution (2.17) becomes

(2.25)

where the products are now only over the (n  1) functions eha. the quantities xi in (2.17)

become

(2.26)

a

xa = eh 1

(yb ehb)

1
n ,

xn = (yb ehb)

1
n .

thus we see that after making the coordinate transformation (2.23), the solution (2.17)

with n parameters 2

i is nothing but a solution of the identical form, but with transformed

parameters

2
i = (2

1, 2

2, . . . , 2

n 1, 2

n )  (2

1  2

n , 2

2  2

n , . . . , 2

n 1  2

n , 0) .

(2.27)

thus there are actually only (n  1) independent parameters in the solutions (2.17), im-
plying 7, 6 and 4 in d = 4, 5 and 7 respectively.

a simple example of the transformation (2.27) is the case where all the i have a common

value, . in this case the above transformation leads to a solution where all the i vanish,

and the the geometry is locally exactly anti-de sitter. it is possible however for the geometry

to change abruptly at some radius. this is the case, for example, if one has a spherical shell
of d3-branes at a radius . outside the shell, the geometry is ads5  s5, exactly the same
as if the shell were collapsed to a point. inside the shell the geometry is ten-dimensional at

space. this conguration has been considered in [16, 22, 23]. it was pointed out already

in [16] and emphasized in [23] that the background outside the shell is insensitive to what

spherical distribution of branes one puts inside the shell: only the total number of branes

controls the overall curvature.

the transformation (2.27) is a generalized shell theorem: as we will see in later sections,

it eectively exhibits a class of brane distributions that all have the same exterior.

further applications of the transformation (2.27) arise if we consider a situation where

m of the 2
2
n m+2 =  = 2
parameters

i parameters are equal. suppose we order the parameters so that 2

n m+1 =
n  l2. then, after making the transformation (2.27), we will have new

i = (2
2

1, 2

2, . . . , 2

n m, 0, 0, . . . 0) ,

(2.28)

i = 2

where 2
i  l2, and so the conguration is mapped to one with only (n  m) non-
vanishing parameters. if l2 is the smallest value among the original parameters, then all
the transformed parameters 2
were smaller than l2, then after the transformation they will correspond to 2

i will be positive. however, if some of the original parameters
i parameters

that are negative.

in fact, quite generally we can use the transformation to map the sets of solutions with

purely non-negative 2

i parameters into sets of solutions with arbitrary numbers p and q

8

n  l2 > 0 and 2

1 = 0 transforms into a solution with 2

i , with 0  p + q  n . for example, the solution with 2

1 < 0. thus a special case of the n = n  1 solutions with positive 2

of positive and negative 2
2 =
i = (l2, 0, 0, . . . , 0),
3 =  = 2
2
with 2
i transforms
to an n = 1 solution with negative 2
1. likewise, we can obtain a solution with n negative
2
i parameters from a solution with (n  n) positive parameters. these transformations
will be useful later, when we derive results for the charge distributions that allow us to

view the domain-wall solutions oxidized to higher dimensions as distributions of m-branes

or d-branes. thus having obtained results for the distributions for arbitrary numbers n of
positive 2
this mapping between solutions with positive 2

i parameters, we can immediately read o results for sets of negative parameters.
i parameters and negative parameters will
also be useful when we consider the spectra of wave equations in these background geome-

tries in section 6. in general, for reasons explained in section 6.1, we refer to parameters

with 2

i > 0 as lorentzian, and parameters with 2

i < 0 as euclidean.

3 higher-dimensional origin

in the previous section, we considered the d-dimensional theories of gravity plus scalar elds

that arise as consistent truncations of the gauged maximal supergravities in d = 4, 5 and 7,

and we showed that they admit multi-parameter domain-wall solutions. it is believed that

the gauged maximal supergravities can all be obtained as consistent kaluza-klein reductions

using sphere compactications of certain higher-dimensional supergravities. specically, it
has been shown that the d = 4 and d = 7 gauged theories arise from the s7 and s4

reductions of eleven-dimensional supergravity, while the d = 5 gauged theory is expected
to arise from the s5 reduction of type iib supergravity.3 we can therefore expect that

the truncations of the various gauged supergravities that we considered in the previous

section should themselves be directly derivable as consistent kaluza-klein reductions from

the relevant higher-dimensional supergravities.

in this section, we shall show explicitly how the various d-dimensional theories that

we discussed in section 2 can be embedded into the higher-dimensional supergravities. the

crucial point will be that these are consistent embeddings, meaning that all solutions of the

lower-dimensional theories will be solutions of the higher-dimensional ones. in each case,

the scalar elds of the lower-dimensional theory will appear as parameters describing inho-

3it has also been shown that the largest gauged supergravity in d = 6 arises as an s4 reduction of

massive type iia supergravity [12].

9

mogeneous deformations of the compactifying sphere metric. because of the inhomogeneity,

demonstrating the consistency of the reduction procedure is highly non-trivial, since there

is no simple group-invariance argument that can account for it.

in fact a crucial point

in all such kaluza-klein reductions is that the scalar elds appear not only in the metric

reduction ansatz, but also in the reduction ansatz for an antisymmetric tensor eld of the

higher-dimensional supergravity. it is only because of remarkable conspiracies between

the contributions from the scalars in the metric and eld strength ansatze that the consis-

tent reduction is possible. thus the issue of consistency is one that can be addressed only

if the complete reduction ansatze, including those for the antisymmetric tensor elds, are

given.

let us rst present our results for the consistent reduction ansatze. we can give all

three cases, for the reductions to d = 4, 5 and 7, in a single set of formulae. in each case

the relevant part of the higher-dimensional supergravity theory comprises the metric ds2,
and an antisymmetric tensor eld strength f(d).4 for the case of d = 4, we have the 4-form
eld f(4) of eleven-dimensional supergravity. for d = 7, we have f(7) =  f(4), where f(4) is
again the 4-form of eleven-dimensional supergravity. for d = 5, we have f(5), from which
the self-dual 5-form h(5) will be constructed as h(5) = f(5) +  f(5). our expressions for the
metric and eld-strength ansatze are

and the i are a set of n direction cosines that satisfy the constraint

d.

clearly, if the scalar elds ~ all vanish, so that we have xi = 1, the internal metric in

(3.1) reduces to the standard round metric on the (n  1)-sphere, proportional to pi d2

i .
when the scalars are nonzero, they parameterize inhomogeneous deformations of the round

sphere metric. the scalars also appear in the ansatz for the antisymmetric tensor, as

4we place hats on all higher-dimensional elds, and also on the hodge  operator in the higher dimension.

10

given in the second line in (3.1). it is straightforward to show that with this ansatz, the
equations of motion and bianchi identity for the eld strength f(d) correctly reproduce the

d-dimensional scalar equations of motion that we derived in section 2. in fact it is not hard

to see that in each of the cases d = 4, 5 and 7, the equations of motion for the scalars come

from the bianchi identity

d f(d) = 0 .

(3.4)

for the case d = 4, (3.4) is, of course, directly the bianchi identity of the 4-form eld
of d = 11 supergravity. for d = 7, where we have f(7) =  f(4), the bianchi identity
f(4)  f(4). since
(3.4) originates from the equation of motion for f(4), namely d f(4) = 1
the ansatz for f(7) in (3.1) implies that f(4)  f(4) = 0, we are again just left with (3.4).
finally, in d = 5 the bianchi identity for the self-dual 5-form h(5) = f(5) +  f(5) is just
d h(5) = 0, since we are taking the other elds of the type iib theory to be zero in our
reduction. furthermore, from the form of the ansatz for f(5) given in (3.1) in this case,
we can see that we will separately have to have d f(5) = 0 and d f(5) = 0, and in fact it is
the former that will imply the equations of motion for the xi. in fact in all three cases,
the eld equation d f(d) = 0 can be seen to be identically satised, supplying no further
information.

2

to see how (3.4) implies the equations of motion for the lower-dimensional scalars, we
note from the ansatz for f(d) in (3.1) that the only terms arising will be when the exterior
derivative lands on the i coordinates in the prefactor of (d), and on the x 1
dxi factor

i

in the last term in the eld-strength ansatz. thus we deduce that

xi (cid:16) log xi  4g2 x 2

i + 2g2 xi xj

xj(cid:17) d(2

i ) = 0 .

(3.5)

we cannot simply deduce from this that the factor enclosed in the large parentheses vanishes

for each i, since the i coordinates are not independent, but are subject to the constraint

i ) = 0. thus the most we can deduce from (3.5) is that

where q is an undetermined i-independent quantity. however, since we know that the xi

satisfy (2.3), it follows thatpi log xi = 0. thus summing over i in (3.6), the left-hand side

must vanish, which gives us an equation for q. substituting back into (3.6) then gives

section 2.

a complete verication of the consistency of the reduction ansatz (3.1) would require

substituting it into the higher-dimensional einstein equation. the components of this equa-

tion with indices living in the lower dimensions should then give rise to the d-dimensional

einstein equation (2.22), while the internal and mixed components should give rise to the

scalar equations of motion, and to certain non-trivial self-consistency checks. we have not

yet performed a complete check of the einstein equation, on account of the complexity of the

curvature calculations that are involved here. however, the computations here are rather

similar to ones that arose in [15], where a number of non-trivial checks on the consistency

of the ansatz in the einstein equation were performed. in fact, if we specialize our ansatze

here by setting as many pairs of xis as possible equal, they can be seen to reduce precisely

to special cases of the ansatze considered in [15].

to see how this occurs, consider rst a case where n is even. then, we may set

x1 = x2  ex1 ,

and also introduce angles a such that

x3 = x4  ex2 ,

etc.

full gauge group was made. (of course here, where we are considering just the metric and
scalar elds in the lower-dimensional supergravities, the surviving u (1)4 and u (1)3 gauge

elds of the maximal abelian truncation are also set to zero.)

12

in the case when n is odd, a similar type of specialization leads us back to a consistent
embedding of the form that was derived in [15] for the maximal abelian u (1)2 truncation
of d = 7 gauged supergravity into d = 11 supergravity compactied on s4. in this case,
we make pairwise identications for the rst (n  1) xi and i, as in (3.8) and (3.9), and
keep the single left over quantities ex0  xn , and 0  n as they are. now, we nd that

4 domain walls as distributed p-branes

having obtained the reduction ansatz for the scalar potentials of lower-dimensional gauged

supergravities from kaluza-klein sphere reductions, it is straightforward to oxidize the

ads domain wall solutions obtained in section 2.2 to higher dimensions. in this section we

show that the ads7, ads4 and ads5 domain wall solutions can be viewed as distributed

m5-branes, m2-branes and d3-branes respectively.

various cases arise, depending on how many of the i parameters are non-zero. without loss
of generality, we may consider the cases where the rst n parameters 2

for each n in the range 0  n  4. (note that there is no need to consider the case with

that is equivalent to having just 4 non-vanishing parameters.) we nd that the charge

the distribution for n = 2 with 1 = 2 were also given in [16]. we may note an interesting

relation among these distributions, which will persist in future sections and was rst noticed

in [7]. if the n = 4 distribution is integrated along one of its principle axes (that is, in the

direction of one of the yi), and a factor of (yi) is then inserted, the result is the n = 3

distribution. and if the n = 3 distribution is integrated similarly, the result is the n = 2

distributionet cetera. as we explained earlier, there is a priori no preferred choice of

ve-parameter solution: for example, if all the i were equal, there would be no preferred

spherically symmetric distribution of branes since all of them lead to the same perfect
ads7  s4 exterior. (this is because the ve-parameter solution is degenerate owing to the
symmetry of the solution given by (2.27).)

14

however, there is a unique ve-parameter solution which shares the property that inte-

grating it along some principle axis leads to the n = 4 solution. it is

5 six-dimensional gauged supergravity

in our discussion so far, we have focussed on the class of scalar plus gravity theories that

correspond to certain consistent truncations of the gauged maximal supergravities in d = 4,

5 and 7. there is one other case that we wish to consider here, namely gauged supergravity

in d = 6. this is an unusual case in that there apparently does not exist a gauged super-

gravity with the maximum number of supersymmetries that are allowed in six dimensions.

the known su (2) gauged theory has n = 2 rather than n = 4 supersymmetry [24]. it was

suggested in [25] that it could be related to the ten-dimensional massive type iia theory
[26]. it has recently been shown that it can be obtained from an s4 reduction of massive

type iia supergravity [12]. since it does not have maximal supersymmetry there is nothing

to preclude coupling it to n = 2 matter. the six-dimensional scalar plus gravity theory that

we shall consider here can be interpreted as a consistent truncation of the su (2) gauged

n = 2 supergravity in d = 6 coupled to certain matter multiplets. (domain wall solutions

in pure d = 6 gauged supergravity were previously studied in [27, 28].

the only part of the massive iia lagrangian that is relevant for our truncation comprises

the metric, the dilaton and the 4-form eld strength:

 (d5x  dh 1) ,

where g = 3m/2 and the harmonic function satises

z1/3 z(z1/3zh) + yh = 0 .

one class of solutions of this dierential equation can be expressed as follows [29]:

(5.2)

(5.3)

(5.4)

h = c + g10/3 z

(~y )d4y

(|~y  ~y |2 + z2)5/3 ,

where c is an integration constant, which we shall set to zero. it should be emphasized,

however, that this is not the most general solution to equation (5.3). if the distribution
function  is a delta function, i.e.  = (4)(~y), the metric becomes warped ads6  s4 [30].
inspired by the previous examples of m-branes and the d3-brane, let us consider the

following charge distribution,

(5.6)

where p 2

 = 1, summing over  = (0, i). note, however, that although we included a
parameter 0 for the sake of symmetry, it should actually be set to zero. next, we dene
h = 1 + 2

/r2 (and so h0 = 1). it then follows that the function h becomes

h =

in terms of the redened coordinates yi and z, the transverse-space metric is

(5.13)

having written the solutions in an abstract form, we can now propose to view (5.11) as a

general kaluza-klein reduction ansatz, for arbitrary six-dimensional elds, whose equations

of motion can be derived by substituting the ansatz into the ten-dimensional equations of

motion for the massive iia theory. (of course, for this to succeed, it is necessary that the

reduction ansatz (5.11) be a consistent one, which appears to be the case.) in particular, we

can determine the structure of the scalar potential. this is described by four independent

scalars, parameterised by x, subject to the constraint (5.13).

5.1 d = 6 potential

we can work this out by starting from the ansatz (5.11) for the 4-form eld strength. its

bianchi identity gives us the equations of motion for the x. thus we can immediately

where q is an undetermined quantity independent of . (the ambiguity here arises, as

 = 1.) we can determine q by noting that

3 log x0 +xi

4

log xi = 0 .

(5.15)

(recall we are splitting the indices as  = (0, i).) thus if we take this particular sum over

terms in (5.14), the left-hand side must vanish, hence giving us an equation for q:

q = g2 x0 xi

5.2 ads6 domain walls as distributed d4-d8-branes

the scalar lagrangian (5.18) with potential (5.21) admits a six-dimensional domain wall

solution with four parameters i, given by (5.12). from the d = 10 standpoint, the solution

can be viewed as a distribution of d4-d8-branes with charge distribution function (5.5).

for the various numbers of non-vanishing parameters i, the charge distribution function 

is given by

a remark about the evaluation of the integral (5.4) with the charge distributions (5.23) is

in order here. in the previous cases, of the d3-brane, m2-brane and m5-brane, the analogous

integrals could be studied rather easily (as in [16]) by rst specialising the coordinates ~y in

the resulting harmonic functions h(~y) to simple values for which the integration is more

easily performed. h(~y) for this specialised range of ~y coordinate values can then be matched

to the general solution of laplaces equation, expressed as a sum over a complete set of

elementary solutions, yielding a unique determination of the expansion coecients. this

then establishes that provided h(~y) evaluated over the specialised coordinate range agrees

with the claimed general form for h evaluated over the same range, then the integral over

the distribution must be in agreement with the claimed expression for h(~y) for arbitrary

coordinate values ~y. thus, for example, when evaluating (4.5) for the i = (1, 2, 0, 0, 0)

charge distribution given in (4.6), it suces to evaluate the integral for h(~y) at y1 = y2 = 0,

and verify that it agrees with h given by (4.2) in this restricted coordinate region. one can,

of course, instead directly evaluate the integral (4.5) for h(~y) with generic values for ~y, but

this is quite a bit more complicated in practice. in our present case, with the evaluation

of (5.4) for the d4/d8-brane distributions (5.23), one is on less solid ground if one tries

to invoke uniqueness to argue that it suces to evaluate the integral for h(~y) at special

values of ~y, since, as we remarked, (5.4) is not the most general solution of the equations for

d4/d8-brane intersections. we have therefore performed explicit integrations for generic

~y coordinate values, in order to verify that the distribution integrals do indeed correctly

reproduce the functions given by (5.7).

the discussion is applicable only for non-negative 2

i , it
can no longer be viewed as distributions of solutions of the form (5.4). this is not surprising,

i . for solutions with negative 2

since unlike the d3-brane and m-branes, the harmonic function here (5.4) is not the most

general solution of its equation (5.3). thus whilst for the previous cases the solutions have

to be expressible in terms of distributions of d3-branes or m-branes, here it is more of a

miracle that the six-dimensional ads domain walls with positive 2

i can be expressed as

distributions of d4-d8-branes, with the form (5.4).

it is worth remarking that the d4-d8-brane system also has other features that are rather

dierent from those in the d3-brane, m2-brane and m5-brane systems. the distributed

d3-branes, m2-branes and m5-branes in d = 10 or d = 11 admit lower-dimensional inter-

pretations as extremal solutions in the gauged maximal supergravities in d = 5, d = 4 and

d = 7 respectively. by contrast, the d4-d8-brane systems admit a lower-dimensional inter-

pretation in d = 6, where there apparently does not exist any maximally-supersymmetric

22

gauged supergravity. there does exist a gauged theory with one half of the maximal su-

persymmetry in d = 6 [24] (namely n = 2), and an su (2) gauge group, which arises as a
consistent s4 reduction of massive type iia supergravity [12]. however, this theory contains
only a single scalar eld x, which corresponds to the truncation x1 = x2 = x3 = x4  x,
x0 = x 3 in the six-dimensional potential (5.21). thus all four of the original i parameters

in the solutions (5.12) must be set equal in order that the conguration be a solution purely

within the su (2)-gauged n = 2 supersymmetric theory. we have shown that the more

general congurations (5.12) with all four i dierent are solutions of the six-dimensional

theory (5.18) and (5.21), which can also be obtained as a consistent dimensional reduction

of the massive type iia supergravity. however, this six-dimensional theory is not a trun-

cation of the pure gauged supergravity in d = 6; rather, it is a truncation of a gauged
supergravity coupled to matter.5

6 analysis of the spectrum

the correlations functions (and the spectrum) of the corresponding strongly coupled gauge

theory can be analyzed by studying the wave equations in these gravitational backgrounds.
in particular, the simplest two-point function is that of the operator o  trf 2 +  which
couples to the s-wave dilaton . in ten dimensions the dilaton obeys a free wave equation.

in lower dimensions, a consistent truncation ensures that the dilaton can be taken to be

independent of the spherical coordinates, and the s-wave dilaton does not participate in the

gauged supergravity scalar potential. generically we expect there always to be a minimal

scalar in our asymptotically ads geometries: a eld  which obeys the corresponding

laplace equation,

(gg ) = 0 .

(6.1)

we choose the ansatz  = eit (r), where  characterizes the energy level of the solution,

specied by (r), which is chosen to depend only on the radial coordinate r. then for the

distributed d3-branes and m-branes discussed in the previous sections, the wave equation

5a closely parallel situation which, however, highlights the distinction is that of the two-charge ads

black hole solutions of maximal (n = 2) so(5)-gauged supergravity in d = 7. if the charges are set equal,

the black holes can be viewed as solutions in pure n = 1 su (2)-gauged supergravity, but if the charges

are unequal, then from an n = 1 standpoint the black holes are solutions of n = 1 gauged supergravity

coupled to the matter that results from viewing the n = 2 pure supergravity as an n = 1 theory. the

dierence in d = 6 is that there is no maximal gauged supergravity that could provide the alternative

n = 2 viewpoint.

6.1 spectrum with euclidean parameters

in the approach to modelling conning gauge theories through higher dimensional branes

at nite temperature (initiated in [35]), the spectrum of low-energy excitations in the gauge

theory is the same as the spectrum of supergravity modes in the dual asymptotically anti-de

sitter geometry. by solving the eigenvalue problems (6.2) and (6.3) rotated to euclidean

signature we are gleaning information regarding the dual gauge theory. although it has

been argued in [31] that some of these gauge theories are indeed conning, the analysis

of [34] suggests that often they are not. the issue raised in [34] is that the ratio of the

tree-level thermal mass to the temperature vanishes for some of the gauginos in a limit

corresponding to one of the domain walls we have considered in this paper. the would-

be conning gauge theory approaches a non-conning supersymmetric theory in the limit.

what sets the mass scale of the spectrum in such a case is not the scale of connement,

but rather the higgs vev that determines the state on the coulomb branch. we will see

from supergravity calculations that the spectrum can be discrete, or a continuum above a

gap, or a continuum with no gap. the eld theory understanding of these results is not

very satisfactory, although some attempts at explanation have been made in [7, 21, 22, 23]

(mainly in the lorentzian cases).

when wick-rotating (6.2) and (6.3) to euclidean signature, we have a choice of whether

to change the signs of the quantities 2
spinning brane geometries [32, 33] suggests that the natural choice is to send 2

i . the relationship of some of these geometries to
i in
the wick rotation. the reason is that the i are proportional to the angular momenta in the
6the glue-ball (0++) spectra for the euclidean spinning brane backgrounds are determined by the same

i  2

wave equations and thus the same analysis is applicable in these cases also. (see [34] and references therein.)

spinning brane geometries, and angular momentum becomes imaginary on wick rotation.
thus we will refer to 2

i < 0 as a choice of euclidean parameters. for m2-branes, d3-branes,
and m5-branes, the transformation (2.27) allows us to map euclidean parameters back to

lorentzian parameters. the only lorentzian cases that need to be addressed separately are

for the d4-d8-brane system; see section 6.2.

the wave equations (6.2, 6.3) can be cast in the following form:

[yf (y)y  q]  = 0 ,

(6.4)

h and r2

h is an adjustable parameter. for m2-branes, d3-branes, and

where as usual n = 8, 6, and 5 in the respective cases. let us choose r2

h so that the most
positive root of f (y) is at y = 0. we will solve the equation (6.4) subject to regular boundary
conditions at y = 0 and y = , which is the boundary of ads. we are thus excluding from
consideration geometries like spherical shells of branes: the shell would sit at a nite value

of y where the norm of the killing vector /t is nite. to put it another way, we set
one of the i to 0 so that we have only n  1 free parameters. generically, (6.4) cannot be
solved exactly (although in special cases it reduces to a form of the hypergeometric equation

[7, 21]). however we may straightforwardly extract the qualitative features of the spectrum
by analyzing the asymptotics of (6.4) near the horizon (y  0) and near the boundary of
ads (y  ). the qualitative features depend only on how many of the parameters i are
nonzero. let us take 2
i = 0 for the other n  ne values.

i = 1 for ne values of i, and set 2

then the function f (y) takes the form:

f (y) = 4y

with n = 8, 6, 16

behavior

f (y)  y
f (y)  y

2 n

2 ne

for y   ,
for y  0 .

(6.6)

for the analysis of the spectrum it is useful to cast the wave equations (6.4) into the

form of the schrodinger equation. this is accomplished by introducing the new coordinate

25

z, dened by y/z = pf (y), and setting  =  f 1/4. we then nd that (6.4) indeed

takes the form of schrodinger equation:

h2

z + v (z)i  = q ,

v =

2
z log f +

1
16

1
4

(z log f )2 .

(6.7)

in order to determine the qualitative behavior of the spectrum, it now suces to analyze

the schrodinger potential v (z) near the endpoints.

the coordinate z was chosen as an increasing function of y. the potential has the
following properties. firstly, at the ads boundary, which is reached as y  , we have
z  z, where z is nite, and the potential blows up quadratically:

ads boundary : v =

cn

(z  z)2 .

(6.8)

here, the coecient cn depends on n (but not on ne). at the horizon boundary y  0,
we have z  z with z nite for ne = 1, 2, 3, whilst z   for ne = 4, 5, 6, 7. at this
boundary the potential has the form

horizon boundary :

v =

cne

(z  z)2 , ne = 1, 2, 3 ,

v  1 , ne = 4 ,
v  0 , ne = 5, 6, 7 ,

(6.9)

where the coecient is cne is independent of n and depends on ne in the following way:

cne =

ne(3ne  8)
4(ne  4)2 .

(6.10)

the value of cne = { 5

36 ,  1

4, 3

4} for ne = {1, 2, 3} respectively.

thus barring the subtlety that the potential should not have any additional local min-

imum, the spectra have the following universal features. for the cases ne = 1, 2, 3, the

potentials give rise to discrete spectra. when ne = 4, the potential gives rise to a contin-

uous spectrum above a gap, whilst for ne = 5, 6, 7 the spectra are continuous without any
gap. (note that had cne been less than  1
from below. the case ne = 2 with c2 =  1

4 , the spectrum would have been unbounded

4 is precisely on the borderline.)

numerical plots of the various potentials are displayed in figures 1-7, for ne = 1, , 7,
in order to facilitate the comparison of the potentials for a given ne but

respectively.

dierent values of n , in figures 1-3, the additive ambiguity in the denition of z has been

xed by requiring that zi = 0 for all n , and thus the horizon boundary corresponds to

26

z = 0 for all n . the z coordinate was subsequently rescaled so that z = 1 corresponds to

the boundary of ads for all values of n . in figures 4-7, the additive ambiguity in z has

been xed such that zn = 0, and thus z = 0 corresponds to the ads boundary for all n ,
while z   is the horizon boundary. the numerically evaluated potentials, displayed
in figures 1-7, have no additional local minima, thus conrming the nature of the spectra

described above. for each value of ne the universal behavior at the horizon boundary is

apparent, and the potentials increase monotonically with decreasing n . thus for each
ne = 1, 2, 3 the discrete spectra have an increasing gap between the discrete values of q for
the m2-brane (solid lines), d3-brane (dotted lines), d4-d8-brane (dash lines) and m5-brane

(dash-dotted lines) respectively. the rather universal patterns for the spectra for each ne

is also reected in the patterns for the charge distributions given in the previous section.
note also that while the geometries with ne  4 have naked singularities, nevertheless
the spectra are regular (and are not unbounded from below).

a few additional comments are in order: the d3-brane case (n = 6) was analyzed in
[7].7 the integer n used in [7] is the same as our n for the lorentz parameters, and thus our
ne is related to the n in [7] by ne = 6  n. we found no unbounded spectrum for ne = 1.

6.2 spectrum with lorentzian parameters

since the case with n equal nonzero lorentzian parameters 2
n > 0 is
equivalent to the case with ne = n  n euclidean nonzero parameters, for the m2-brane
(n = 8), d3-brane (n = 6) and m5-brane (n = 5),8 all these cases have already been

2 =  = 2

1 = 2

encompassed in the study above.

on the other hand the d4-d8-brane does not have this symmetry (note that in d = 6,

we have from (2.19) that n = 16

3 , which is a non-integer) and the analysis for lorentzian
parameters has to be done separately for these examples. the wave equation (6.3) in this
case can be cast in the form (6.4) where y = r2 runs from 0 (at the horizon) to  (the
boundary of ads) with the function f (y) taking the form:

f (y) = 4y

1

2 (n n) (y + 1)

1

2 n ,

(6.11)

7note also in this case the example with ne = 4 corresponds to the study of glue-ball (0++) spectra in

euclidean spinning-brane backgrounds with two angular momenta, which were studied in [17]. there, using

the wkb approximation, the rst few discrete eigenvalues were found. however, the present analysis shows

that the spectrum becomes continuous for higher excitations.

8this is easily seen by performing a coordinate transformation on either a solution (or the wave equation

(6.2)): r2

 r2 + 2

i . thus both the distributions of the brane congurations (see previous section) and the

spectra in these backgrounds are identical.

27

with n = 16

3 . the quantity f is again an increasing positive function of y, with the

asymptotic behavior

f (y)  y

for y   ,

for y  0 .

(6.12)

here n = 1, . . . , 4 is the number of (equal) non-zero parameters 2
took (without loss of generality) to be +1, i.e. 2
analysis of the spectra is qualitatively the same as for the examples with max(2

i  0 whose values we
n = 1. (in the case of i 6= j the
i ) = 1, and

1 =  2

the other parameters set to zero.)

using the procedure, outlined above, to obtain the schrodinger potential v (z), one

arrives at the following features of the potential v (z) at the endpoints. the ads boundary
is again reached as y  . at this boundary we have z  z, with z nite, and the
potential blows up quadratically as in (6.8), with coecient cn independent of n. at the
horizon boundary (y  0), we have z  z with z nite for n = 2, 3, 4 and z =  for
n = 1. at this boundary the potential has the form

horizon boundary :

v  0 n = 1 ,
v =

cn

(z  z)2 , n = 2, 3, 4 .

(6.13)

where n = n  n and the coecient is cn takes the same form as (6.10) but with ne
replaced by n. thus for the d4-d8-brane with n = 16
3 , we nd that when n = 1 there is
a continuous spectrum without a gap, while the spectra for n = 2, 3, 4 are discrete, with
the corresponding values cn = [+ 15
cn >  1

4 , the spectrum is always bounded from below.)

4 , 21

100 ,  3

the numerically evaluated potentials are displayed in figures 1-4, for n = 4, 3, 2, 1,

respectively, as another (bold) solid line. these potentials are quantitatively dierent in

behavior from the respective potentials with ne = 1, 2, 3, 4. nevertheless, it appears that
the cases with n and ne = 5  n are qualitatively similar.

note added

when this paper was nearing completion, the work [36] appeared, which has some overlap

with our results in the case of d3-branes.

figure 1: the schrodinger potentials v (z) with ne = 1 euclidean parameters are given for

m2-branes, d3-branes, d4-d8-branes and m5-branes, with successively increasing values of

the potential. the additional solid line represents the d4-d8-brane with n = 4 equal lorentz

parameters. the additive ambiguity for z is xed in such a way that z = 0 corresponds to

the horizon boundary, and z is rescaled so that z = 1 is the boundary of ads in all cases.
