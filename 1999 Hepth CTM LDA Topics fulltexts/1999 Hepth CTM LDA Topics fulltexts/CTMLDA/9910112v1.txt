abstract

it is well-known that the chiral wznw bloch waves satisfy a quadratic classical exchange
algebra which implies the ane kac-moody algebra for the corresponding currents. we here
obtain a direct derivation of the exchange algebra by inverting the symplectic form on the
space of bloch waves, and give a completely algorithmic construction of its generalized free
eld realizations that extend the classical wakimoto realizations of the current algebra.

1 introduction

the wess-zumino-novikov-witten (wznw) model [1] of conformal eld theory has proved to
be the source of interesting structures that play an increasingly important role in theoretical
physics and in mathematics [2, 3]. among these structures are the quadratic poisson bracket
algebras [4][16] that arise from the chiral separation of the degrees of freedom in the model,
which is based on the form of the classical solution of the eld equation given by

g(xl, xr) = gl(xl)g1

r (xr).

(1.1)

here xc (c = l, r) are lightcone coordinates and the gc are quasiperiodic group valued elds
with equal monodromies, gc(x + 2) = gc(x)m for some m in the wznw group g. the
classical exchange algebras can be regarded as fundamental since the ane kac-moody (km)
symmetry follows as their consequence, and help to better understand the quantum group
properties of the model (see e.g. [17]) by means of canonical quantization [18, 19, 20]. one
should however note that after the chiral separation, which essentially amounts to forgetting
the equal monodromy constraint on the pair (gl, gr), the poisson structure is highly non-unique
[14, 15, 16]. a natural choice consists in restricting the monodromy m of the chiral wznw
elds to be diagonal, in which case the resulting classical exchange algebra can be described as
follows [11, 12, 13]. denoting any of the chiral wznw bloch waves by b(x),

b(x + 2) = b(x)e,

  h,

where h is a cartan subalgebra of the lie algebra g of g, the exchange algebra reads as

nb(x) , b(y)o =
2 x

(1.2)

(1.3)

(1.4)

where e, hk is a cartan-weyl basis of g and  is a constant. for the exchange r-matrix
r() to be non-singular, the monodromy parameter  has to be restricted to a domain in h
where () / i2z for any root . notice also from (1.3) that the 2-periodic current

j = bb1

(1.5)

indeed satises the km poisson brackets

{tr (taj)(x), tr (tbj)(y)} = tr ([ta, tb]j)(x)(x  y) + tr (tatb)(x  y),

(1.6)

where (x  y) = 1

2 pnz ein(xy) and ta is any basis of g (for the notations, see also sec. 2).

our main purpose here is to construct generalized free eld realizations of the exchange
algebra given by (1.3) that extend the wakimoto realizations [21] of the current algebra. the
wakimoto realizations of the km current are well-understood both at the classical and quan-
tized level and proved useful in many respects (see e.g. [2, 22, 23, 24, 25]). their extension to
accompanying realizations of the wznw bloch waves have also received attention [7, 8, 15, 24],
but, except for the simplest cases, a fully algorithmic construction has not appeared yet. at

1

the classical level, we present such a construction in sec. 3. the construction is summarized by
the diagram (3.10), where all the arrows represent poisson maps, which is a new result for the

map cw dened by (3.18). for completeness, in sec. 2 we also give a derivation of the exchange

algebra. this derivation is quite dierent from those in [11, 13] and conceptually close to that
in [12]. in order to obtain (1.3), we will directly invert the symplectic form  which we use in
sec. 3 as well  that the space of bloch waves inherits from the full wznw phase space.

2 derivation of the exchange algebra of bloch waves

throughout the paper, let g be either a complex simple lie algebra or its normal real form,

and g a corresponding lie group. denote by eg (resp. eg) the loop group (algebra) consisting

of the 2-periodic, smooth, g-valued (g-valued) functions on the real line r. choose a cartan
subalgebra h  g that admits the root space decomposition

g = h  x

g,

(2.1)

and an associated basis hk  h, e  g normalized by tr (ee) = 2
an invariant scalar product on g. by using this basis any a  g can be decomposed as

||2 , where tr denotes

a = a0 + ar with a0  h, ar = x

etr (ea), e :=

1
2

||2e.

(2.2)

fix an open domain a  h which has the properties that () / i2z for any root,    
h, and the map a   7 e  g is injective.

let us now dene mg

bloch by

mg

bloch := {b  c (r, g) | b(x + 2) = b(x)e,   a  h },

(2.3)

and endow it with the dierential 2-form

g,

bloch(b) = 



2 z 2

0

dx tr (cid:16)b1db(cid:17) (cid:16)b1db(cid:17)




2

tr (cid:16)(b1db)(0)  d(cid:17) .

(2.4)

it is easy to check that dg,
a symplectic form on mg
form on the space of classical solutions of the wznw model, as explained in [12, 14, 15].

bloch = 0 and below we shall see that this formula actually denes
bloch can be obtained from the natural symplectic

bloch. note that g,

it will be convenient to parametrize b  mg

bloch as

b(x) = h(x) exp (x) ,

 :=


2

,

where   a and h  eg. this one-to-one parametrization yields the identication

mg

bloch = eg  a = {(h, )}.

correspondingly, a vector eld x on mg

bloch is parametrized by

x = (xh, x)

xh  th eg

2

x  ta  h

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

with h1xh  te eg  eg. by regarding  and h as evaluation functions on mg

bloch, we may
write x = x() and xh(x) = x(h(x)). equivalently, x can be characterized by its action on
b(x),

b1(x)x(b(x)) = exh1(x)x(h(x))ex + xx(),

(2.8)
where the function b1(x)x(b(x)) on r is uniquely determined by its restriction to [0, 2]. in
general, the derivative x(f ) of a function f on mg
bloch is dened by using that any vector
is the velocity to a smooth curve. that is, if the value of the vector eld x at b  mg
bloch
coincides with the velocity to the curve (x, t) at t = 0, (x, 0) = b(x), then for a dierentiable
function f we have x(f )[b] = d

dt f [(x, t)]|t=0.

a function f on mg

bloch is henceforth called admissible if its derivative with respect to any

vector eld x exists and has the form

x(f ) = hdf, xi = tr (df x) +z 2

0

dx tr (cid:16)(h1dhf )(h1xh)(cid:17)

(2.9)

where

h eg,

df = (dhf, df ) with dhf  t 

df  t 
(2.10)
is the exterior derivative of f . in this denition we identify t 
a with h by means of the scalar
product tr  and also identify t 
0 tr (, ), whereby we have
h1dhf  t 
bloch  b 7 b(x) are
dierentiable but not admissible, while e.g. the fourier components of the current j and the
components of  are admissible functions. it is also worth noting that the matrix elements of
the nonlocal g-valued function given by the path ordered exponential integral of the current
j over a period are, in fact, not admissible, but the trace of any of the powers of this (wilson
loop) function is admissible, since it can be expressed as a function of  alone.

e eg = eg. it is clear that the local evaluation functions mg

e eg with eg by the scalar product r 2

a

we now wish to show that g,

bloch is symplectic in the sense that it permits to associate a
unique hamiltonian vector eld, y f , with any admissible function, f . the dening property
of y f is that it must satisfy

hdf, xi = x(f ) = g,

bloch(x, y f )

(2.11)

for any vector eld x. in order to determine y f from this equality, we rst point out that in
terms of the variables (h, )

g,

bloch(h, ) = 



2 z 2

0

dx tr(cid:16)(h1dh)  (h1dh)

+ 2(h1dh)  (h1dh)  2d  h1dh(cid:17).

it follows that

bloch(x, y f ) = z 2

g,

0

tr(cid:16)(h1y f (h))h1x(h) + [h1x(h), h1y f (h)]

+ y f ()h1x(h)  x()h1y f (h)(cid:17).

this implies the following equations for y f :

(cid:16)h1y f (h)(cid:17)

+ [h1y f (h), ] + y f () =

(2.14)

(2.15)

given dhf and df , we will next nd b1y f (b).

on account of (2.8), (2.14) is in fact equivalent to

(cid:16)b1y f (b)(cid:17)

(x) =

whose solution is given by

b1(x)y f (b(x)) = b1(0)y f (b(0))

dy ey(h1dhf )(y)ey.

(2.17)

hence the only nontrivial problem is to determine the initial value

qf := b1(0)y f (b(0)) = h1(0)y f (h(0)).

to this end, note from (2.8) that

y f () = eb1(2)y f (b(2))e  b1(0)y f (b(0)).

by using (2.17), the cartan part of (2.19) requires that

y f () =

(2.22)

as for the remaining unknown, q0

f = 2df  z 2

dy (h1dhf )0(y).

(2.23)

in conclusion, we have found that the hamiltonian vector eld b1y f (b) is uniquely de-
termined and is explicitly given by (2.17) with b1(0)y f (b(0)) = qf in (2.22), (2.23).
in
the derivation of y f we have crucially used that  is restricted to the domain a  h. at
the excluded points of h some denominators in (2.22) may vanish, whereby g,
bloch becomes
singular.

the poisson bracket of two smooth enough admissible functions f1 and f2 on mg

bloch is

determined by the formula

{f1, f2} = y f2(f1) = g,

bloch(y f2, y f1).

(2.24)

we now explain that in a certain sense this poisson bracket is encoded by the classical exchange
algebra (1.3). for this purpose we consider functions of the form

f(h, ) = z 2

0

dx tr ((x)b(x)),

4

(2.25)

where b(x) is taken in a representation1  of g and (x) is a smooth, matrix valued, smearing-
function in that representation. it is easy to check that f is admissible if

(k)(0) = (k)(2) = 0 k = 0, 1, 2 . . . ,

and the exterior derivative of f at (h, ) is given by

(df)(h, ) =

(2.26)

(2.27)

(2.28)

we here denote by hk, h k and ta, t a dual bases of h and g, respectively. the last formula
extends to a smooth 2-periodic function on the real line precisely if (2.26) is satised. the
hamiltonian vector eld y f is then found to be

i sign (y  x)(cid:17)

,

0 < x, y < 2

(2.31)

with r() given by (1.4). since the representation  is arbitrary, this can be symbolically
written in the form (1.3).
it is clear that the local formula (1.3) completely encodes the
poisson brackets since y f can be recovered if the right hand side of (2.30) is given.

since the current j = bb1 and the monodromy parameter  are functions of b, their
poisson brackets can be derived from the exchange algebra (1.3). we can also determine the

hamiltonian vector elds of the functions k := tr (hk) and f := r 2

 is a 2-periodic, smooth, g-valued test function, directly from (2.14), (2.15) as

0 dxtr(cid:16)(x)j(x)(cid:17), where

y k(b(x)) =

1


b(x)hk,

y f(b(x)) = (x)b(x).

(2.32)

this implies that j generates the km poisson brackets (1.6), and the current algebra is cen-
tralized by the functions of .

it is worth remarking that the jacobi identity of the poisson bracket (1.3) is equivalent to

the following equation for the exchange r-matrix:

[r12(), r23()] +xk

h k

k r23() + cycl. perm. =

f c
ab t a  t b  tc,

(2.33)

1we use the notation tr = ctr, where tr is the trace over the representation  and c is a normalization

factor that makes ctr(ab) independent of  for a, b  g.

5

ab tc and tr (tat b) = b

where [ta, tb] = f c
a. this is a dynamical generalization of the modied
classical yang-baxter equation, and it has been veried in [11] that r() in (1.4) satises it.
this equation appears in other contexts as well [27, 28, 29] and was recently studied e.g. in
[30, 31, 32].

the classical exchange algebra (1.3) is also valid for a compact simple lie group, k, obtained
as a real form of a complex simple lie group, g (like k = su(n)  sl(n, c) = g). to see
this, let k  g be a compact real form of a complex simple lie algebra g. one can realize k
as

k = spanr{ihk, f +

 , f 

 | k  ,   + }

with

f 

 =

||
2

(e  e), f +

 = i

||
2

(e + e)

(2.34)

(2.35)

where hk (k  ), e (  +) form a chevalley basis of g corresponding to the set of
simple roots, , and positive roots, + (see e.g. [33]). if a is now a regular domain in the
cartan subalgebra of k, we have

a   = i = ixk

 khk with  k  r.

(2.36)

using also that cot(y) = i coth (iy), r() in (1.4) can be rewritten as

r(i ) = x+

||2

coth(i

( ))e  e =

1

2 x+

cot(

2

( ))f +

  f 
 .

(2.37)

this means that if  = i , then the r-matrix on the right hand side of (1.3) lies in k  k.
therefore (1.3) with (1.4) can be consistently applied to k-valued bloch waves. this can be
shown to be the correct result in the compact case by deriving the exchange algebra similarly
as above starting with k,
bloch. however, the free eld realizations discussed subsequently are
valid only in the case of a complex lie algebra and its normal real form.

3 generalized wakimoto realizations

at the classical level the generalized wakimoto realizations of the current algebra are given by
certain poisson maps

equipped with the poisson bracket in (1.6). the other notations are explained below. by
elaborating the idea outlined in [26], we will then prove that w can be lifted to a poisson (in
fact, symplectic) map

which gives a realization of g-valued bloch waves in terms of g0-valued bloch waves and free
elds.

w (3.1) with the parabolic subalgebra (g+ + g0)  g as follows. one of the constituents is the

to describe the other factor in (3.1), consider the manifolds eg+ and eg whose elements are
translations, identify the cotangent bundle of eg+ as

{+(x) , +(y)} = 0,

where v  is a basis of g+. the map w is dened by the formula:

w : (bg0)

.

one can verify [25] that this is a poisson map, i.e., the poisson bracket of j in (1.6) follows
from the poisson brackets of the constituents (i0, +, i).

since a symplectic map is always a poisson map as well, cw provides us with a realization
the analogous exchange algebra of the g0-valued bloch waves and the poisson algebra of t  eg+

consider some global coordinates q on g+ and dene the matrix n(q) = tr (cid:16)v1

for g = sl(2) the wakimoto realization of bloch waves was already described in [7, 15] and
some other special cases can be found in [24]. these results are in agreement with our general

construction of the map cw in (3.18).

finally, we illustrate the formula in (3.18) by a series of simple examples for the group
g = sl(n) (either real or complex). the parabolic subalgebras of sl(n) are associated with
the partitions of n, and we consider the 2-block cases (the map w in (3.1) is described in these
cases in [25]). that is to say, we let the underlying integral gradation of g = sl(n) be dened
by the eigenvalues of adq with a diagonal matrix

q =

in this case g are abelian subalgebras, which leads to a simplication of the formulae. in
particular, we can introduce the convenient parametrizations

furthermore, if we now denote

s = (cid:20) 1n1

then eq. (3.17) is explicitly solved as

ab =

1  a  n2, 1  b  n1.

(3.33)

combining these equations, (3.18) yields a realization of the sl(n)-valued bloch-wave b in
terms of the elds q, p and 0. by subsequently using a similar wakimoto realization for 0,
and so on, one can iteratively build up a complete free eld realization of b. incidentally, 0
can be written in the alternative form

0 = eq(cid:20) u

d(cid:21) ,

where eq(x), u(x) and d(x) are u(1), sl(n1) and sl(n2)-valued independent bloch-waves.
the wakimoto realizations of the ane km algebras in generalized fock spaces, at the
level of vertex algebras as opposed to the above poisson algebras, have many applications in
conformal eld theory [2, 22, 23]. an explicit formula for such realizations of the current j
was derived in [25] by quantizing the expression (3.9).
it would be very interesting to also
quantize (3.18). the exchange algebra of the resulting vertex operators should contain the
quantized version of the r-matrix r() which has been constructed recently for all lie algebras
in a universal manner [34]. another open problem is to nd an analogue of the rather simple
construction of the wakimoto realizations presented here and in [25] for the case of q-deformed
ane km algebras. we hope to return to these questions in the future.
