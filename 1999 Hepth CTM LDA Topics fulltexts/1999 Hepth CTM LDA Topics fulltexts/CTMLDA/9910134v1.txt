abstract

it is shown that the ads3 gravity action with boundary terms is non invariant
under dieomorphisms and that its lie derivative has the form of the weyl anomaly
in two dimensions. this variation is compensated by a weyl transformation of the
boundary metric when the radial derivative of the metric on the boundary is expressed
in terms of the stress tensor of a liouville eld. the obtained invariance of the action
under the combined transformation of a dieomorphism and a weyl transformation
allows to interpret the computed lie derivative as minus the weyl anomaly of the
two-dimensional eective action.

brown and henneaux have shown [1] that the asymptotic symmetry group of anti-de
sitter gravity in three dimensions is the conformal group in two dimensions with a central
charge c = 3l/2g. we are interested in understanding this central charge as the weyl
anomaly of the two-dimensional eective action. this anomaly has been calculated in [2]
by means of a regularization procedure and for a constant weyl parameter1. here we will
relate it to the non invariance of the action under dieomorphisms. we compute the lie
derivative of the ads3 on-shell action and show that it has the form of the weyl anomaly
in two dimensions with the value of the brown-henneaux central charge. however the
variation of the action can be compensated by a weyl transformation on the boundary,
provided that the radial derivative of the metric on the boundary is expressed in terms
of the stress tensor of a liouville eld. moreover the liouville equation and the einstein
equation are shown to be satised at the same time. therefore the invariance of the action
under the combined transformation of the dieomorphism and the weyl transformation
is established and the lie derivative of the action can be interpreted as minus the weyl
anomaly of the two-dimensional eective action. in this way, the relation between ads3
gravity and liouville theory [4] is recovered at the level of the weyl transformations prop-
erties and of the equations of motion. the work presented here was done in collaboration
with f. englert, m. rooman and p. spindel, and a extended version of these results will
be published separately [5].

the action considered is the einstein-hilbert action for three-dimensional gravity with
a negative cosmological constant, improved by the gibbons-hawking surface term and a
constant surface term:

s =

1

16g zm q(3)g((3)r +

2
l2 )d3x +

1

8g zm q(3)g(2dn +

1
l

)d2x.

(1)

the constant term makes the lie derivative of the action nite. the gibbons-hawking
term gets rid of the second derivatives of the metric and makes the action stationary
on the equations of motion for small variations of the metric that keep it xed on the
boundary. here, because of the cosmological constant in the einstein equations, the metric
diverges at spatial innity and the boundary metric is ill-dened. yet a conformal class
of boundary metrics can be builded by multiplying the metric by an arbitrary function
(which is called the dening function) that vanishes on the boundary and taking the value
of this product on the boundary as the boundary metric. as this metric changes by a
conformal transformation when the dening function is changed, a conformal equivalence
class of boundary metrics has been dened.

according to feerman and graham [6], a suitable choice of coordinates allows to put

any solution of the einstein equations in the form:

(3)g dxdx =

l2
4y2 dy2 +

1
y

gij(y, x)dxidxj,

(2)

where y = 0 on the boundary. the metric gij appearing in (2) can be expanded order by
order in the radial coordinate y, leading to the following development:

(3)g dxdx =

l2
4y2 dy2 + (

1
y

g(0)ij + g(2)ij )dxidxj + o(y),

(3)

1in a recent paper, the anomaly has been obtained for arbitrary weyl parameters by computing the

boundary eective action [3].

2

where g(0)ij = gij(y = 0, x) is a representative of the conformal class of boundary metrics
and g(2)ij is the rst radial derivative of gij on the boundary. the einstein equations
constraint the metric gij order by order in y. the equations of motion for g(2) are given
by:

t r(g1

(0)g(2)) = 

di(g1ik

(0) g(2)kj )  dj(g1ik

r(g(0)),

l2
2
(0) g(2)ik) = 0.

(4)

(5)

we see that, unlike in higher dimensions where g(2) is uniquely determined by the einstein
equations, there is an equation of motion for its trace-free part. when g(2) is chosen, the
rest of the solution is determined. this shows that the on-shell action depends on the
boundary metric g(0) and on the trace-free part of g(2).

we consider now dieomorphisms that keep the metric in the form (2), i.e. such that
(3)gyy = dif f

(3)gyi = 0. they are given by:

dif f

dif f y = 2(x)y,

dif f xi = 

l2

4 z y

0

gij(x, y),jdy,

and induce on g(0) and g(2) the following transformations:

dif f g(0)ij = 2g(0)ij ,
dif f g(2)ij = l2dij.

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

this dieomorphism keeps g(0) in its conformal class (which is unique in two dimensions).
yet the lie derivative of the action on the equations of motion gives:

dif f s =

l

16g zm qg(0)r(g(0))d2x,

(10)

showing that the action is not invariant under the dieomorphism.

to restore the invariance, we would like to compensate the above dieomorphism by

a weyl transformation on the boundary:

w g(0) = 2g(0),

(11)

which clearly cancels the tranformation (8) induced by the dieomorphism on g(0). we
recall that the on-shell action depends not only on the boundary metric g(0) but also
on the trace-free part of g(2) because there correspond dierent g(2)s solutions for the
same g(0). during the weyl transformation, this further degree of freedom needs to be
controlled to ensure that we are back to the initial solution, i.e.
the transformation
properties of g(2) must be specied in order to compensate exactly its variation (9) under
the dieomorphism. to induce this transformation, we note that the dependence of the
action on the trace-free part of g(2) can be expressed in terms of a eld  living on the
boundary. we take for  the following conformal weight:

w  = ,

3

(12)

and look for an expression for g(2) as a functional of g(0) and .

we can check that the relation for g(2) in terms of g(0) and  that implies the correct
transformation for g(2) under the weyl transformation is given by the following expression:

g(2)ij = l2[dij + ij + g(0)ij (e2 

1
2

kk)].

it can be written more compactly in terms of the on-shell liouville stress tensor tij:

where tij is derived from the liouville action:

1
l2 g(2)ij =

8g

l

tij 

1
2

g(0)ij r,

s =

l

8g z (

1

2qg(0)gij

(0)ij +

1

2qg(0)r + qg(0)e2)d2x.

(13)

(14)

(15)

the constants in front of the action and tij have been adjusted to match the value of the
weyl anomaly that will be computed below.

under the weyl transformations of g(0) and ,

w g(0) = 2g(0),

w  = ,

equation (13) implies the searched-for transformation for g(2):

w g(2)ij = l2dij.

(16)

(17)

(18)

moreover, we see that the eld  satises the liouville equation when the einstein equation
(4) on the trace of g(2) is satised:

t r(g1

(0)g(2)) +

l2
2

r = l2(2 +

1
2

r + 2e2) = 0.

(19)

the einstein equation (5) on the trace-free part of g(2) is then automatically veried:

di(g1ik

(0) g(2)kj)  dj(g1ik

(0) g(2)ik) = l2j(2 

r  2e2) = 0,

(20)

1
2

and expresses the conservation of the liouville stress tensor. indeed it can be written,
with the use of (19), as:

l2 8g
l

dit i

j = 0.

(21)

after doing the dieomorphism (8,9) and the weyl transformation (16,17), we are back

to the initial solution and the action is invariant under this combined transformation:

the value of the weyl anomaly of the two-dimensional eective action can then be deduced
from expression (10):

(dif f + w )s = 0.

(22)

with

w s = dif f s = zm qg(0)a,

a =

3l
2g

r
24

.

(23)

(24)

we recover in this way the central charge of the brown-henneaux asymptotic algebra [1].
