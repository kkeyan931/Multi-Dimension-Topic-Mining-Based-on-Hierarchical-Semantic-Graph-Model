abstract

a method for obtaining solutions to the classical equations for scalars plus gravity in
ve dimensions is applied to some recent suggestions for brane-world phenomenology.
the method involves only rst order dierential equations. it is inspired by gauged
supergravity but does not require supersymmetry. our rst application is a full non-
linear treatment of a recently studied stabilization mechanism for inter-brane spacing.
the spacing is uniquely determined after conventional ne-tuning to achieve zero four-
dimensional cosmological constant. if the ne-tuning is imperfect, there are solutions
in which the four-dimensional branes are de sitter or anti-de sitter spacetimes. our
second application is a construction of smooth domain wall solutions which in a well-
dened limit approach any desired array of sharply localized positive-tension branes.
as an oshoot of the analysis we suggest a construction of a supergravity c-function
for non-supersymmetric four-dimensional renormalization group ows.

the equations for uctuations about an arbitrary scalar-gravity background are also
studied. it is shown that all models in which the fth dimension is eectively com-
pactied contain a massless graviton. the graviton is the constant mode in the fth
dimension. the separated wave equation can be recast into the form of supersymmetric
quantum mechanics. the graviton wave-function is then the supersymmetric ground
state, and there are no tachyons.

1 introduction

phenomenologists have recently studied higher dimensional gravitational models con-
taining one or more at 3-branes embedded discontinuously in the ambient geometry.
scenarios with two 3-branes provide an explanation of the large hierarchy between the
scales of weak and gravitational forces and contain a massless 2++ mode which repro-
duces newtonian gravity at long range on the branes [1, 2]. in the following paper we
present results of our study of models of this type: specically, results on the smoothing
of discontinuities and stabilization of inter-brane spacings in 5-dimensional models with
gravity and a scalar eld. the issue of ne-tuning in such models is also addressed.
we also discuss the uctuation equations in these models somewhat dierently from
treatments in the recent literature.

the centerpiece of this work is a supergravity-inspired approach to obtain exact so-
lutions of the nonlinear classical eld equations in gravity-scalar-brane models which
is valid even without supersymmetry. after a brief introduction to the technical issues
in section 2, this approach is presented in section 3 and applied to a class of models
containing one positive and one negative tension brane [1] with compact s1/z2 geom-
etry in the fth dimension. stabilization of the brane spacing is a generic feature of
these models, but it is not guaranteed that the branes will be at. indeed, obtain-
ing at branes requires a ne-tuning of the model precisely equivalent to setting the
four-dimensional cosmological constant to zero, and if the ne-tuning is imperfect, the
induced metric on the branes will be de sitter space or anti-de sitter space. the stabi-
lization mechanism is a generalization of the work of [3]; however, our treatment also
includes back-reaction of the classical scalar prole. an explicit model is presented in
section 4.

in section 5 we obtain smooth solutions of gravity-scalar models which approach
discontinuous brane geometries in a certain sti limit. any array containing only
positive tension branes can be smoothed in this way. we also remark on the usefulness
of our rst-order formalism for the description of supergravity duals to renormalization
group ows.

our constructions have some parallels in earlier supergravity domain wall literature
(see [4] for a review). there are also similarities with more recent literature, for example
[5, 6].

in section 6 we discuss the equations for linear uctuations about a gravity-scalar-
brane conguration. we use the axial gauge and a parameterization in which the
4-dimensional graviton appears universally as a constant mode in the fth dimen-
sion. this mode is normalizable since that dimension is either manifestly or eectively
compact. the graviton equation can be transformed into the form of a schrodinger
equation in supersymmetric quantum mechanics. the graviton is the supersymmetric

1

ground state, so there is no lower energy state which would be a tachyon in the present
context.

2 the issues

we start with the ve-dimensional gravitational action

s = z d5xg(cid:20)

4

r +

3

l2(cid:21) ,

(1)

in + signature. the most general ve-dimensional metric with four-dimensional
poincare symmetry is

ds2 = e2a(r) ij dxidxj  dr2 ,

(2)
with ij = diag{1,1,1,1,1}. anti-de sitter space is the solution of the eld
equations of (1) with a(r) = r/l. this metric describes a poincare coordinate patch
in ads5 with boundary region r   and killing horizon region r  +.

the basic positive tension brane considered in [1, 2] is given by a(r) = |r|/l. this
can be thought of as the discontinuous (in rst derivative) pasting of the horizon halves
of two poincare patches with the 3-brane at r = 0. one can obtain this as the solution
of the eld equations for an action consisting of (1) plus a brane tension term:

sbrane = x z d4x drq| det gij|  (r  r) .

(3)

here we have generalized to any number of branes; gij is the metric induced on each
brane by the ambient metric g. for a single brane at r1 = 0 with brane tension 1,
the ads scale must be related by 1/l = 1/3 to achieve a solution in which the induced
metric is at. this constraint represents a ne-tuning which is precisely equivalent to
setting the four-dimensional cosmological constant equal to zero.

one can obtain a system of one positive and one negative tension brane [1] by
considering two branes in (3) with 2 = 1 and r2 = r0. this leads to the piece-wise
linear scale function a(r) shown in gure 1a. the fth dimension is then periodic
with period 2r0 and there is a reection symmetry under r  r. this is the s1/z2
situation originally considered in [7, 8].

another possibility is to consider [9] a second positive tension brane, which admits a
solution for a(r) shown in gure 1b. in this case, the bulk action (1) must be changed
to admit dierent scales l1, l2, l3 in the three spatial regions. the scales are related
to the brane tensions by 1/l1 + 1/l2 = 21/3 and 1/l3  1/l2 = 22/3 > 0. again
these relations must be regarded as ne-tunings absent a dynamical mechanism by
which they arise.

positive tension branes in an innite fth dimension.

there are solutions of the equations of motion for any choice of the inter-brane
spacing r0 in both scenarios above, so it is important to ask whether there is any
principle which xes or stabilizes the value of r0. a rst thought is that the total
action integral of the conguration might depend on r0, reecting an imbalance of
forces on the two 3-branes, and therefore could be minimized. however it will be
shown in the next section that the action vanishes for all r0, which apparently reects
the fact that the output value of the classical four-dimensional cosmological constant
vanishes, as is consistent with the input value assumed when we considered solutions
containing at 3-branes. in later sections we discuss models in which a real scalar eld
 with potential v () is coupled to gravity with brane tensions () depending on .
for a given choice of v () and (), it is generally the case that the brane spacing
r0 is uniquely determined.

discontinuous solutions of eld equations would be less articial if they could be
obtained as a limit of smooth congurations. in section 5 we present coupled scalar-
gravity models with potential v () (and no branes initially present). in these models
the scalar  plays a dierent role, that of an auxiliary eld, and hence is given a dierent
symbol. the models have smooth domain wall solutions which approach any desired
discontinuous conguration of positive tension branes as a scale parameter in v () is
varied. other parameters in v () determine the inter-brane spacing (e.g. r0) and ads
scales (e.g. li) of the limiting solution, and the solutions have zero total action at all
stages of the limiting procedure. the scalar  is eectively frozen in the sti limit
of discontinuous branes.

only positive tension brane congurations can be smoothed in this way. a negative
tension brane eectively has negative energy which cannot be modeled in a conventional
gravitational theory. nevertheless a negative tension brane is consistent with micro-

3

physical requirements if it is located at the xed point of a discrete group action. the
crucial point is that transverse uctuations are then projected out; otherwise they
would have negative kinetic terms.

3 the goldberger-wise mechanism

it was proposed in [3] that the dynamics of a scalar eld could stabilize the size of an
extra dimension in the brane-world scenario of [1]. the mechanism was to have a scalar
 with some mass in the bulk of a ve-dimensional spacetime and some potentials 1()
and 2() on two four-dimensional branes at the boundaries of this spacetime. such a
situation might be realized in the context of type i string theory [10, 7], the horava-
witten version of the heterotic string [8], or some more ornate string theory realization
of the basic scenario of [1]: in all cases, spacetime has the topology r3,1  s1/z2. the
claim of [3] is that stabilization of the length of the interval s1/z2 can be achieved
without ne-tuning the parameters of the model (namely the mass of the scalar and
the potentials 1() and 2()).

the analysis presented in [3] neglected back-reaction of the scalar eld on the metric
as well as the eect of dierent scalar vevs on the tensions of the branes. the aim of
this section is to include these eects exactly. to achieve a static solution with 3 + 1-
dimensional poincare invariance to the full gravity-plus-scalar-plus-branes equations,
one ne-tuning is necessary. this ne-tuning amounts to setting the four-dimensional
cosmological constant to zero.

the ne-tuning is somewhat dierent from the ones discussed in [11, 12]. in [11] it
was argued for a theory with only gravity in the bulk that a nonzero four-dimensional
cosmological constant must necessarily be accompanied by rolling moduli (correspond-
ing to changing brane separations). in [12] it was conjectured that a state with nonzero
cosmological constant might relax to zero cosmological constant, again through evolu-
tion of some moduli specifying a brane conguration: in short, it was suggested that
an appropriate brane dynamics might ne-tune itself to zero cosmological constant.
we will nd a more conventional alternative: there is generically a solution which is a
warped product of a maximally symmetric four-dimensional spacetime and an interval.
the four-dimensional spacetime can be at minkowski spacetime, de sitter spacetime,
or anti-de sitter spacetime, and which is chosen depends on the details of the scalar
potentials in the bulk and on the branes. roughly speaking, one can construct a four-
dimensional eective potential ve whose extremal value determines the cosmological
constant. there is no obvious dynamical principle in the absence of supersymmetry
which seems capable of forcing ve = 0. in particular, the presence of a fth dimension
simply does not constrain the extremal value of ve. from a certain viewpoint this
should not come as a surprise: brane-world scenarios must reduce at low energies to a

4

four-dimensional gravity-plus-matter theory, including some brane moduli with some
potential, and it would seem rather accidental than otherwise for this potential to enjoy
a fantastic property like zero extrema.

3.1 a solution generating technique

we generalize the action (1) + (3) to include a scalar eld (xi, r):

s = zm

d4xdrq| det g|(cid:20)

1
4

r +

1
2

()2  v ()(cid:21) x zb

d4xq| det gij|() , (4)

where m is the full ve-dimensional spacetime and b is the codimension one hyper-
surface where each brane is located. it will always be assumed that the branes are at
denite values of r, so that the xi are perpendicular to the brane hypersurfaces.

the solution generating method described in this section could be applied to a fairly
general setup with many codimension one branes on a nite or innite interval. in this
section our focus will be the case of a nite interval s1/z2 where the only branes are the
ones at the ends of the interval. we will work in the upstairs picture: z2-symmetric
congurations on the circle s1. the bulk integration will extend over the entire s1.
properly speaking, the action should be cut in half after this integration. this can be
achieved simply by setting g5 = 1/8 rather than 1/4.

we will initially assume a ve-dimensional metric of the form (2). we also assume
that the scalar depends only on r. these assumptions follow if one demands a solution
with 3+1-dimensional poincare invariance. we will later generalize slightly by replacing
ij with a de sitter or anti-de sitter metric. it is straightforward to obtain the ricci
tensor:

rij = e2a (4a2 + a) ij

r55 = 4a2  4a ,

and to show that the equations of motion are

(6)

we generally use primes to denote d/dr. the last of the equations in (6) is the usual
zero-energy condition that follows from dieomorphism invariance. if one dierentiates
it with respect to r, the result can be shown to vanish identically if the rst two
equations are satised.

by integrating the rst two equations on a small interval (r  , r + ) one can

if these conditions are satised at each brane, and if the rst and third equations of (6)
are satised away from the branes, then we have a consistent solution of the equations
of motion everywhere.

unfortunately we are still left with a dicult non-linear set of equations. we have
been able to take advantage of one integral of the motion (namely the zero-energy
condition) to eliminate a, and if we wished we could eliminate a algebraically in the
 equation by using the zero-energy condition, but we would still have a dicult second
order equation for  with no further obvious conserved quantities. the purpose of this
section is to exhibit a general method of reducing the system (6) to three decoupled
rst order ordinary dierential equations, two of which are separable. the method
is inspired by supersymmetry but can be carried out independent of it. we should
remark at the outset that our method is only simple in the case of a single scalar :
one of our dierential equations has  as the independent variable, and if there were
several scalars it would become a dicult partial dierential equation.

for some w (). then it is straightforward to verify that a solution to

(10)

(it was previously noted in [13] that the jump conditions could be satised in a specic
model if the brane tension was given identically by w (), which is a much stronger
constraint on the model than we assume.) potentials of the form (8) occur in ve-
dimensional gauged supergravity [14], and the conditions (9) arise as conditions for
unbroken supersymmetry: the vanishing of the dilatino variation leads to the rst
equation in (9) and gravitino variation leads to the second.

for us, the key observation is that, given v (), (8) can be solved for w (), and there
is one integration constant in the solution. whether a gauged supergravity theory can

6

be constructed so that the supersymmetry conditions lead to any desired w () is an
interesting question which we will not address in this paper. (it would also be amusing
to ask whether one could come up with interesting supersymmetry-breaking scenarios
by starting with a ve-dimensional gauged supergravity and constructing a solution
using (9) with the wrong w ().) the relevant point for the analysis at hand is
that (8) and (9) together have solutions specied by three integration constants, one
of which is the trivial additive constant on a. there are likewise three integration
constants for the solutions of (6), and again one is the trivial additive constant on a.
from this simple parameter count we may expect that the space of solutions includes
all possible solutions to (6). issues of global existence and discrete ambiguities seem
to be the only obstacles to realizing this expectation. these are best seen in a more
denite framework, so we will now proceed to our main example.

the rest of this section is devoted to the case where the only branes are the ones
at the ends of the interval s1/z2. again, we work in the upstairs picture where
these branes are realized as kinks in a(r) at the xed points of z2. if the z2 reection
includes an orientifolding, then string theory allows one of these two branes to have
negative tension. the negative tension brane must be located at a xed point of the
discrete group action: it does not introduce diculties with negative kinetic terms or
unboundedness of energy because it is just part of a background, not something which
can be dynamically created anywhere in space. we x the additive ambiguity on the
variable r by taking the positive tension brane to be at r = 0. the negative tension
brane then lives at some r0 (see gure 1) which is the modulus of the theory that the
mechanism of [3] purports to stabilize. the physical parameters that go into the theory
are the scalar potential v () and the tensions 1() and 2(). these are assumed to
emerge from the microscopic physics (for instance string theory) which leads to this
ve-dimensional picture in a low-energy limit (that is, low-energy compared to string
scale and ten-dimensional planck scale as well as any further compactication scales).
a moduli stabilization mechanism would be regarded as ne-tuned if one has to impose
some relationship among v (), 1(), and 2() to achieve a static solution.

before explaining how the solutions to (6) can be generated using (8) and (9), let us
do a quick count of parameters and constraints to show that a ne-tuning is necessary
to obtain a static solution with at branes. there are three integration constants for
the  equation plus the zero-energy equation in (6): they are (0), (0), and a(0).
there is one additional parameter, namely r0, so four parameters in all. there are
four constraints coming from the two jump conditions at the two branes. naively one
would conclude that there is no ne-tuning:
four contraints on four parameters can

r. myers [15] has also noted that (8) and (9) can be used to generate kink solutions, independent
of supersymmetry. in the study of rg ows in ads/cft he has considered an example with cubic
w () which is similar to the single-brane solution which we will discuss in section 5.

7

generically be solved. but a(0) is completely irrelevant because a(r) enters into the
equations of motion and the jump conditions only through its derivatives. that leaves
three parameters subject to four constraints:
indeed ne-tuned. this ne-tuning is
equivalent to the ne-tuning required in a theory without scalars between the brane
tensions and the bulk cosmological constant.

we will now argue in detail that any solution of (6) can be written as a solution to
(8) and (9) with an appropriately chosen w (). it is necessary to choose w odd under
the z2 symmetry, just because a is equal and opposite at the two points on any given
z2 orbit away from the xed points. with this in mind we can restrict our attention
to region a in gure 1. the jump conditions become

where 1 and 2 are the values attained by (r) at r = 0 and r = r0, respectively.
notice these constraints have the same form as (8) , with the  playing the role of w .
for generic v and , the equations (12) admit only a discrete set of solutions for 1
and 2. given the physical input into the model, namely v (), 1(), and 2(), the
discrete values 1, 2 are the points in eld space where at branes can be consistently
inserted.

 (1) =  1
 has the same sign as 1

let us now integrate the equation (8) and x the single integration constant by
requiring w (1) = 1(1). because of (8) we have w
 (1), and the plus
sign is guaranteed if we assume that w ()
 (1) in the vicinity
of  = 1. the solution (a(r), (r)) of (9) subject to (0) = 1 must coincide with the
solution (a(r), (r)) of (6) subject to (0) = 1 and (0) = 1
1
 (1), because both
2
of them satisfy the same boundary data. this is enough to conclude that locally every
solution of (6) can be generated by solving (8) and (9). global issues of the existence
and uniqueness of solutions to (8) and (9) are best addressed with a specic model in
hand. we will return to these points in section 4.

besides providing an ecient method for generating solutions to (6), the use of (8)
and (9) also allows us to characterize in a simple way how 1(), 2(), and v ()
have to be ne-tuned. having rst xed w () in the manner described in the previous

figure 2: sample w (solid line), v (dotted line), 1 and 2 (grey lines) as functions of

paragraph, and then integrated (9) to obtain (r), we can determine the position
of the second brane by (r0) = 2. there are no parameters left to x (except for
the trivial additive constant on a), but we must still demand w (2) = 2(2) and
 (2) =  2
 (2) in order that the jump conditions at the second brane be satised.
because of the dening property (12) of 2, either one of these last two equations
implies the other up to a sign. thus there is precisely one ne-tuning, as expected from
the earlier parameter count. the advantage of introducing w is that the ne-tuning
condition can be expressed in terms of the solutions of the single ordinary dierential
equation (8) (see gure 2). it should be kept in mind that we are working strictly at
the classical level. if we tune parameters so that w () and 2() are tangent, then
loop corrections to () and v () must be expected to spoil the relation.

it is true that if this ne-tuning can be achieved, there is no cosmological constant
allowed in the four-dimensional action. a quick way to see this is to show that the
lagrangian is a total derivative with respect to r when (8), (9), and (10) are satised:
then the four-dimensional lagrangian must vanish. let us dene

since we assumed 3 + 1-dimensional poincare invariance in our ansatz from the start, zero four-
dimensional cosmological constant was guaranteed. the following computation is therefore only a
consistency check.

the form of (14) makes it clear that (9) are indeed a sort of bps condition for solu-
tions of (6). however, because the perfect squares in (14) come in with opposite signs,
there is no obvious analog of a bogomolnyi bound. another important implication of
(14) is that the total action of any conguration of at branes vanishes. this is even
true of non-periodic arrays provided a   as r  .

3.2 non-zero cosmological constant

the ne-tuning to achieve zero cosmological constant was already commented on in
[3]. the purpose of this section is show that if the ne-tuning is imperfect, then there
are solutions without rolling moduli but where the metric on the branes is de sitter
space or anti-de sitter space.

most of the analysis is similar to section 3.1, so we will be brief. the metric ansatz

is

ds2 = e2a(r)gijdxidxj  dr2 ,

(16)
where gij is the metric of four-dimensional de sitter or anti-de sitter spacetime: rij =
3gij, where  is the four-dimensional cosmological constant (positive for de sitter
spacetime and negative for anti-de sitter spacetime). explicitly, we may write the
four-dimensional metrics as

the jump conditions (7) are unchanged. neither a(r) nor || can be determined
unambiguously from the equations of motion because they enter only in the com-
2 ln||. we will see that this combination is what determines the
bination a(r)  1
four-dimensional cosmological constant in four-dimensional planck units. we could
adjust the additive constant on a, if we so desired, to set  = 1 for de sitter space-
time or  = 1 for anti-de sitter spactimee. the important point is not to count the
magnitude of  as an adjustable parameter separate from the additive constant on a.
already from (18) we can see why there should be a solution with no ne-tuning
of parameters. the  equation and the zero-energy condition together have three
integration constants, and there is also the brane separation r0. because a itself rather
than just its derivatives enters into the equations (18), the additive constant on a is no
longer trivial. as before there are four boundary conditions (two jump conditions at
each brane), so generically one expects a (locally) unique solution for any given v (),

the solution in the bulk (more precisely, in region a of gure 1) can still be obtained

we are grateful to martin gremm and lisa randall for pointing out to us an error in an earlier

version concerning thes rst order equations.

11

note that this completely changes the character of the problem. in the case of zero
cosmological constant, the rst order equations (8), (9) allowed us to nd solutions for
given v directly by rst integrating (8) to solve for w (), then using the equations (9)
to solve consecutively for (r) and a(r). we now see that if we do not ne-tune the
cosmological constant to zero, we obtain a complicated non-linear rst order system of
dierential equations for 3 functions w (r), (r) and a(r), now viewed as functions of
a single independent variable r, which we cannot simply solve for in sequence. v ()
is still to be considered the information that is put in from the lagrangian, but its
relationship with w can no longer be isolated from the rest of the system. derivatives
with respect to  should now be thought of as




=

(r)


r

.

(21)

to make this point more transparent, it is useful to rewrite the system (19) as an
autonomous system, that is in the form

a = f (a, w, ),

 = g(a, w, ),

w  = h(a, w, ) ,

(22)

where

f (a, w, ) =

w (r)2(cid:19) .

(23)

while for a generic v () this system will still be hard to solve, it is very well suited
for generating examples where v () is determined at the end. for any given shape of
the warp factor a(r) one desires, one can nd a potential that supports such a solution
by the following procedure: pick a(r), calculate a(r), solve a =  w
3  algebraically
for w (r), and use  = q w 
2 to obtain (r). v (r) can now simply be determined by
plugging in w and , and after inverting (r) to r() one obtains the desired v ().
this procedure for example can be used to generate fat branes (as we will discuss them
in later chapters for the minkowski case) with an ads or ds worldvolume. note that
this simple technique for generating examples is not possible in the obvious rst order
system one could write down simply by introducing one new variable y with the one
new dening equation y = , as it is a standard technique for converting a system of
higher order equations into a rst order system.

if for a given v () we x a(0) arbitrarily, then the 5 other initial conditions, (0),
a(0), w (0), w (0), (0), (0) can be determined up to discrete choices, using the
3 equations from (19) evaluated at r = 0 and the 2 from the rst line of (24). then
(22) can be solved unambiguously for (r), w (r) and a(r). r0 is xed by the last
equality in (19). one is left with one condition, namely the third equality in (24). it
is a (very complicated) constraint on a(0), which generically will have only discretely
many solutions. the point is that we wind up with exactly as many parameters as
constraints, so it doesnt take any ne-tuning to get a solution.

there does not seem to be a simple way to express the action as a sum (or dierence)
of squares plus total derivatives, in analogy to (14). however it is straightforward to
use the equations of motion to show that

in general it is dicult to obtain solutions to (18) or (19) in closed form. we can
however give a complete treatment of the case where there is no scalar and w is just a
constant (namely the square root of the bulk cosmological constant); see also [16, 17].
in this case the only equations we have to solve are the rst equations in each line of
(19) and (24). the solutions can be expressed as follows:

in the ds4 case it is necessary to restrict r0 < r1. the main point which (30) demon-
strates is the following. suppose one starts with any xed negative bulk cosmological
constant, 4/l2, and arbitrary but specied 1 and 2, subject only to the constraint
that if one of the  exceeds 3/l in magnitude, then the other must also exceed 3/l
in magnitude and be of the opposite sign. then there is a unique solution to (30) up
to the usual ambiguity between the additive constant on a and the magnitude of .

both r1 and r0 will be xed in this solution, and so will the combination a  1
which determines the four-dimensional cosmological constant in planck units. the only
exception is when 1 = 2 = 3
l : in this case the branes are at, r1 is a meaningless
additive constant on a, and the brane separation r0 is not xed.

the bulk solutions in (30) have vanishing weyl tensor, hence they are locally ads5.
all we have found, then, is an embedding of ads4 and ds4 as codimension one hy-
persurfaces in ads5. to verify this one can nd an explicit change of variables which
brings the bulk metric into the standard form

let us now focus on the ds4 case with one positive and one negative tension brane at
the ends of the bulk. a solution of the form (30) maps to a strip of the t  r plane
between two curves of the form t = cer/l. here c1 and c2 are positive constants.
because /t is a killing vector of the bulk geometry, we can trivially obtain a broader
class of solutions which have as their boundaries curves of the form t  t = cer/l,
where now t1 and t2 are additional constants, only one of which can be set to 0 through
dieomorphism freedom. in these solutions the proper distance between the branes is
not constant. in fact, generically the branes intersect at some point, or they intersect
the boundary of ads5 at dierent pointsor both.
in the latter case the graviton
bound state ceases to exist at some nite time as measured on the negative tension
brane. this reinforces the intuition that brane-world cosmology can encounter some
curious pathologies.

the strategy of displacing one boundary by some distance along the ow of a killing
vector of ads5 can also be applied to at branes. for instance, one could shift the
negative tension brane forward along the global time of ads5 to obtain a new solution
where the proper distance between the branes is non-constant. the positive and neg-
ative tension branes would then intersect at some time in the distant past, and the
positive tension brane would again retreat to the true boundary of ads5 at a nite
time as measured on the negative tension brane. this is a catastrophe since it means
that gravity would cease altogether in four dimensions: the four-dimensional planck
length would vanish.

4 an explicit model

it is useful now to turn to an explicit example with non-trivial dynamics for a single
scalar. for simplicity, we choose quadratic w (), 1(), and 2() which are tangent
to one another in the manner illustrated in gure 2. explicitly,

w () =

3
l  b2 ,
l2 +  b2

2

3

b24

2b

l! 2 

+

v () = 
1() = w (1) + w (1)(  1) + 1(  1)2 ,
2() = w (2)  w (2)(  2) + 2(  2)2 .

3

,

(33)

in the absence of supersymmetry, there is no preferred choice of w ().

we stress that the physical properties of the model are summarized by v () and the
():
in
section 4.2 we will analyze the dierent possible w () that lead to the particular
quartic v () exhibited in (33). until then we will just assume that the particular
w () that is tangent to 1() happens to be the quadratic one shown in (33). we

15

make this assumption in order to obtain solutions in closed form. the only physical
ne-tuning is the requirement that 2() is also tangent to w (). the quantities
l, b, 1, 2, 1, and 2 are parameters of the various potentials, and no dimensionless
ratio of them should be large if we want to preserve naturalness.

we will always assume that 1 and 2 are positive so that the energetics of 1 and
2 tend to stabilize the positions of the branes in eld space. we will usually assume
b > 0 as well. it should be noted that v () is unbounded below, as is common and
without pathology in ads supergravity.

the brane spacing is determined by the condition br0 = ln(1/2). the dierence

problem, and one easily obtains

a(0)  a(r0) =

(36)

if b > 0, then 2
2 > 0, and only rst term can contribute to the hierarchy. this is
conceivable if bl is fairly small: for instance, if 1/2 = e then one needs bl  1/37.
if b < 0, then both terms in (35) could contribute to the hierarchy. one could for
instance obtain an acceptable hierarchy by taking bl = 1, 1 = 1, and 2 = 15.

the treatment of [3] ignored back-reaction of the scalar prole on the geometry.
crudely speaking this means one should drop the second term in (35) since it came
from a term proportional to the square of the scalar eld in (34). more precisely, (14)
of [3] can be reproduced exactly by dropping the second term in (35) and identifying
their m2l2 with our bl in the limit of small bl. thus the analysis of [3] was essentially
adequate for the case b > 0, where to obtain a large hierarchy one wants a bulk
geometry which is not so far from ads5 that the second term of (35) is large. however

we assume that the four-dimensional and ve-dimensional planck scales are comparable. it is

possible to relax this assumption [18] since the additive constant on a(r) is a free parameter.

16

the inclusion of back-reaction becomes quite important in the b < 0 case, where a large
hierarchy can be most easily obtained via a geometry which deviates strongly from
ads5.

any mechanism for generating large numbers must be probed for robustness. we
may ask, once the hierarchy (36) is obtained, how much can the parameters change
and still give the same weak scale to within errors? for deniteness, let us ask what
change of parameters shifts a(0)  a(r0) by no more than 0.02: this would amount to
a shift of the weak scale by two percent, which is about the ratio of the z width to its
mass. in the b > 0 scenario we described above, a change of 1/2 by about one part
in 2000 changes the weak scale by two percent: multiplicative shifts in this ratio are
magnied by the factor 1/bl. in the b < 0 scenario, changing 2 by about one percent
changes the weak scale by two percent. thus (supercially at least) the b < 0 scenario
is more robust.

4.2 numerics

we now change gears and refocus on (8). the purpose is to illustrate the problem
of selecting a superpotential w () which reproduces a given potential function v ().
however, we shall be content to explore this question only in the model of this section,
where v () is given in (33). it is convenient to rescale variables, partly to prepare for
use of the matlab linked program dfield5 [19]. we therefore dene

v () = 3 b2 u(t) ,

w () = 3 b x(t) ,

figure 3: the tx plane, showing forbidden regions.

the equation is roughly like the energy equation in the mechanics problem of a particle
in an inverted harmonic potential. as in mechanics there are forbidden regions of the
tx plane where x2 +u(t) < 0. at a boundary of this region, which would be a turning
point in a mechanics problem, the slope dx
dt vanishes. according to the general theory
of rst order dierential equations there is a unique solution curve through every point
not in a forbidden region. the inequality

dx

dt(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

shows that no solution reaches |x| =  at a nite eld value.

the dfield5 program quite rapidly provides a reasonable global and quantitative
picture of the space of solutions. the quantities of our problem depend only on the
single dimensionless parameter bl, and we set bl = 1 in our numerical work.

a large-scale plot of the tx plane is shown in gure 3, and we see two large forbidden
regions on the left and right and a small one in the center. the inclined lines at a grid
of points are the slopes, obtained from (39), of the solution curves through each point.
the solution through (t, x) = (0, 1) is shown, and it is easy to see that it gives the
preferred superpotential x0(t) = 1  t2/8 only for t < 0. this is related to the sign
ambiguity of the square root in (39), and it is not a diculty for us because we are

18

(cid:13)
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
primarily concerned with the region t < 0 which includes the full range of the geometry
containing two branes which was discussed in the rst part of this section.

some other representative solutions are also plotted in gure 3. it is not proven, but
it appears to be the case that the only solutions which give a superpotential dened
on the full eld space  < t <  are the curve through (t, x) = (0, 1) and its mirror
image through (t, x) = (0,1), which is also shown in gure 3. other solution curves
reach the boundary of the allowed region at a nite value of t in one direction, and
one can see that x(t) vanishes but x(t) diverges as one approaches the boundary.
by examining an approximate form of (39) and (9) , one can show that these curves
approach the boundary at a nite value of the coordinate r. it then appears that the
solution curve reects, and one must consider solutions of (39) with the other sign
of the square root. the scale factor a(r) is smooth at the turning point. this issue
does not aect our application, since the full brane geometry is contained in a region
without turning points.

lets recall the logic of our construction. the potential v () and left-hand brane
tension 1() are matched at a chosen value  = 1. we then choose the unique
superpotential w () which satises w (1) = 1(1) and agrees in sign of slope with
1(1). agreement in the magnitude of the slope is guaranteed by (8) and (12). we
then integrate the rst order equations (9) which gives the unique solution of the
second order problem (6) with the initial conditions (0) = 1, (0) = 1(1), the
latter from the jump condition (7). for consistency, it is useful to know that any other
choice of w () leads to a dierent solution of (6), one which does not satisfy the jump
conditions. this is quite clear from gure 3, since the jump conditons. e.g. (10), are no

longer satised if we change solution chosen at the relevant xed value t1 = q8/3 1.

we have explored our suggested solution generating technique in only one model.
global issues associated with the turning points do not spoil the applicability of our
method, and the method is certainly easy to use in the reverse mode where we start
with a conveniently chosen w (). we believe that this favorable situation is generic.

5 smooth solutions modeling branes

so far we have been considering solutions to an action that contains explicit -functions
at the positions of the branes. one might wonder to what extent this approach has
already built in the answers one wants to obtain. the purpose of this section is to
present a one-parameter family of purely 5d lagrangians for gravity coupled to a scalar,
labelled by the parameter , whose solutions are generically smooth and asymptote to
a specic -brane solution of the type considered so far. for generic , the smoothed
branes appear as domain walls interpolating between various scalar vacuua.
in the

19

sti limit (  ) the second derivative of the scalar potential goes to innity, so
the scalar becomes very heavy and can be integrated out. the parameters entering the
scalar potential become the brane tensions and positions associated with -function
terms in an action of the type (1) + (3) after integrating out the scalar.

several comments are in order. first, as mentioned before, we will not be able to
treat negative tension branes in this framework. second, the solutions presented in this
section do not have any elds living on the brane, since the smooth solitons that in the
sti limit become the branes do not have any zero modes. both these obstacles can be
avoided by introducing by hand the -functions in the action, but this is precisely
what we want to avoid with the smooth formalism. in principle, the second limitation
above could be overcome by studying a more complicated smooth model which allows
for non-trivial zero modes on the brane.

instead it is the scalar that the branes are made of!

last but not least we should emphasize that even though we are considering once
more 5d gravity coupled to a scalar, this time the scalar should not be thought of as
the bulk scalar  we studied so far, which plays the role of a modulus for the fth
dimension.
in order to avoid
confusion we will call this auxiliary scalar  and reserve the symbol  for the modulus
scalar.
in the sti limit, where the soliton approaches the array of localized -like
branes the uctuations of  are frozen out. the bulk scalar  has to be introduced as a
second scalar. interactions localized on the brane, like the () we introduced earlier,
can be mimicked by coupling the bulk scalar  only to derivatives of .

we study a ve-dimensional action of the form

s = zm

d4x drq|detg (cid:20)

4

r +

1
2

()2  v ()(cid:21) .

(41)

we will work in the rst order framework and hence take v () to be given in terms of a
superpotential as in (8) and study solutions to the rst order equations (9). we will
show that once we specify the potential appropriately, the resulting solitonic solution
describing an array of branes with tension  at positions r in the fth dimension is
specied uniquely.

we are interested in the case where the scalar prole is given as a solitonic domain
wall conguration interpolating between various vacua for the scalar eld, e.g. written
as

(r) = x

1


 tanh((r  r)),

(42)

or a similar function that has the properties that

 in the sti limit (  ) it reduces to an array of step functions of height

 

, and that

20

 its rst derivative is always negative and approaches a collection of -functions

at position r of strength  

.

note that latter property requires all  to be positive, ensuring that the function (r)
is invertible. this solution in the sti limit becomes an array of branes of tension

 =

4
3

2


(43)

and only positive tensions appear.

can we nd a w () in such a way that it allows a solution of the form specied in
(42)? in order to do so, we just rewrite the rst order equation for the scalar ow in
(9) as

2 =

w (r) = 2z r



=

w 


(44)

(45)

w ()

w ((r))

r()

=



r
((r))2 dr.

using invertibility of (r) we can re-express w (r) as w () and hence obtain a potential
v () which leads to a solution of the desired form. the one integration constant in w
corresponds to an overall bulk cosmological constant. it should be chosen in such
a way that a(r) =  1
3 w (r) is positive (negative) to the left (right) of all branes.
since a is always negative, it is always possible to choose the integration constant
this way. as we will see in the next section this property is enough to ensure that there
exists a 4-dimensional graviton. now we can turn the philosophy around and say that
once we have specied v and hence specied the action, or more precisely the bulk
cosmological constant and the cosmological constants between the various branes given
in terms of the value of v () at its minima, the rst order equations then provide us
with a solution of the form (42) for (r) together with the a(r). in the sti limit this
solution approaches an array of sharply localized branes at positions r and tensions
.

one should think of v () as being obtained from integrating out the microscopic
physics. one then can ask again whether there is some dynamical principle that de-
termines the parameters in v . since we expressed w as an integral over ()2 those
parameters are the  and the r. calculating the action integral of the solution as a
function of  and r one nds once more that it is always zero. we remain with a
serious ne-tuning problem: the underlying theory has to be arranged in such a way,
that for given  and r the potential has precisely the form specied by (45). in the
sti limit all that remains of v are its values at the minima  the inter-brane cosmo-
logical constants  and the ne-tuning problem reduces to the standard ne-tuning
the normalization in (42) was chosen in such a way, that those inter-brane cosmological constants

remain nite in the sti limit, 1

for example, in the case of a single brane we start with

(r) =

(46)

(47)

(48)

a is simply obtained by integrating w . in the multi-brane arrays the solution becomes
slightly more complicated due to the cross-terms in ()2 but it is still analytical. one
can show that in the sti limit all possible smoothings lead to the same brane array.

before we end our discussion on smoothing of the singular solutions, let us comment
on how the coupling to the additional bulk scalar looks in this framework. in order to
mimic the localized interactions for the bulk scalar  we couple it to the derivatives of
the auxiliary scalar . basically, this means that we couple a -model for the scalars to
gravity, where the kinetic terms of the auxiliary scalar  depend on the bulk scalar .
in the sti limit this once more will reduce to the solutions discussed in the previous
sections.

similar to (8) and (9) we can nd a rst order formalism for the general action

choosing a two scalar model with 1 =  and 2 =  and choosing g12 = g21 = 0,
g11 = 1 and g22() to be an arbitrary function of  we should once more be able (50)
to engineer a smooth model, this time limiting to multi-brane-array in the presence of
the bulk scalar  with localized interactions.

a count of parameters similar to the ones in section 3.1 and 3.2 allows us to conclude
thatat least locallyany solution of the equations of motion following from (49)

22

which preserves 3 + 1-dimensional poincare invariance can be written as a solution of
(50) for an appropriately chosen w () satisfying (51). suppose there are n scalars
involved in the action (49). each of them satises a second order equation of motion.
the scale factor a satises a rst-order zero-energy constraint analogous to the last
line of (6). so there are 2n + 1 integration constants. one of them can be absorbed
into an additive shift on r. now, (50) leads to only n+1 integration constants since the
scalar equations are now rst order. but there are also n integration constants in (51)
regarded as a partial dierential equation for w (). again one integration constant
can be absorbed into an additive shift on r. the point is that either way we have the
same number of integration constants, so barring non-generic phenomena and global
obstructions, the solution spaces are the same.

this is quite an interesting result in view of the ads/cft correspondence [20,
21, 22]. one of the main puzzles in the correspondence is how one might translate
the renormalization group (rg) equations, which are rst order, into supergravity
equations, which are second order. in [14] rst order equations were extracted from
the conditions for unbroken supersymmetry. these equations are suggestive of an rg
ow based on the gradient of a c-function. the c-function is w (), and its relation
to the conformal anomaly arises because of the equation a =  1
3w : in regions where
the scalars are nearly constant and the geometry is nearly ads5, an application of the
analysis of [23] shows that the weyl anomaly coecients in the conformal eld theory
are proportional to the third power of the radius of ads5, or equivalently to |w|3.
(thus in a sense it would be more appropriate to speak of |w|3 as the c-function.)
in a non-supersymmetric ow, the c-function can still be dened [24, 14] as 3a,
and it is possible to demonstrate a  0 using only the weakest of positive energy
conditions [14]. but then the spirit of rg is lost: one wants to have a notion of
a rst order ow through the space of possible theories labelled by dierent values
of parameters, and whatever c-function one constructs should be dened in terms of
those parameters. the construction of w indicated in (51) seems to realize this idea
explicitly.

however there are some caveats. first, w depends on n integration constants,
where as before n is the number of scalars. it seems reasonable that these integration
constants can be interpreted as specifying the state of the dual eld theory, which does
not change under rgonly the hamiltonian evolves. second, the same phenomena of
forbidden regions and turning points that we discussed in section 4.2 occur also in the
case of several scalars. a forbidden region is a region of (w, ) space where v ()+ 1
3w 2
is negative. barring singular behavior in gij , one nds that the gradient of w vanishes
at the border of these regions, so no ow can cross over. rather, ows reect from the
border and the subsequent ow is controlled by a dierent branch of w . because of
the multi-valued nature of w , we do not regard (50) as a wholly satisfactory starting

23

point for the transcription of supergravity equations into rg equations. however it is
perhaps a step in the right direction.

6 fluctuations around the solution

finally we examine the equations governing uctuations of the metric and scalar around
the classical background solutions of the equations of motion of the action (4). our
methods are somewhat dierent from those in the literature. we choose an axial-
type gauge, and the resulting form of the four-dimensional graviton is particularly
simple. transverse traceless modes in general obey the equation of a massless scalar
in the curved background, and by recasting this as the schrodinger equation for a
supersymmetric quantum mechanics problem, we argue that there are no space-like
modes threatening stability.

we impose the axial gauge constraint, so named for its resemblance to a3 = 0 in

electrodynamics:

h5 = 0 ,

where  = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5. we can then write the total metric in the form

ds2 = e2a(r)(ij + hij) dxidxj  dr2 ,

(52)

(53)

where we extracted a factor e2a from the uctuation term to simplify future equations.
axial gauge is not a total gauge x, as dieomorphisms generated by a vector eld
i = e2a(r) i(xj), 5 = 0 preserve the condition (52) while transforming the uctuations
hij as

hij(xk, r)  hij(xk, r) + i j(xk) + j i(xk) .

(54)

note the resemblance to four-dimensional dieomorphisms. k

the ricci tensor can be computed from the metric (53). to zeroth order in the

uctuations we continue to have (5), while to rst order we calculate (using maple):

where ij  (ij  ij/ ) and . . . indicates nonlocal terms. the hij satisfy

jhij = ij hij = 0 .

(60)

(61)

we emphasize that (61) applies only to the components dened in (60) and is not a
gauge choice; it would be incompatible with (52) and the residual gauge freedom (54).
for the hij, (59) simplies enormously. the transverse traceless projection removes

the right-hand side, and we are left with

(cid:16)2
r + 4ar  e2a (cid:17) hij = 0 .

25

(62)

notice that all -function jumps have canceled out; this is nothing but the equation
of motion for a free massless scalar in our curved background. in an ads5 black hole
background, the spin-2 components of the graviton were also found to obey a free scalar
wave equation [27, 28].

we expect one solution of our equations to be the four-dimensional graviton. since
hij = 0. we can easily see

it is massless in the four-dimensional sense, it must obey
that such a solution to (62) is simply the r-independent plane wave

hij = cij eipx ,

(63)

where p2 = 0 and cij is a constant. thus in this presentation the phenomenological
graviton has a very simple form.

the norm of metric uctuations is

|| h||2 = z dr e4a(r) gik gjl (e2a(r) hij) (e2a(r) hkl) = z dr e4a(r) hij h

ij

,

(64)

where we recall that the full metric perturbation has the additional e2a(r) factor, and
we are neglecting the dependence on the other four dimensions, where hij has the usual
plane-wave normalizability. we see that the graviton mode (63) is normalizable be-
cause the r-direction is eectively compactied in these models. the s1/z 2 geometries
are manifestly compact. for arrays of positive-tension branes only, the range of r is
  < r < , but the norm converges if we restrict to cases where

a  1/l > 0 as
a  1/l+ < 0 as

r   ,
r   ,

(65)

which are asymptotically anti-de sitter geometries. in all such models, which include
the smooth congurations of section 5, there is a naturally massless four-dimensional
graviton as described above.

having identied the four-dimensional graviton, we next turn to the question of
stability. if the equations of motion were to admit uctuations with a space-like mo-
mentum, it would be evident that the zeroth-order solution  our classical background
 is not stable. for the transverse traceless components, we can cast the expression
(62) in a form resembling a supersymmetric quantum mechanics problem, where p2
plays the role of the energy, and thus argue that p2  0.

to accomplish this, we rst need to eliminate the factor e2a multiplying the momen-
tum. we can do this by changing variables to coordinates in which the background is
conformally at:

now (62) takes the form

ds2 = e2a(z)(cid:16)(ij + hij) dxidxj  dz2(cid:17) .

(2

z  3 a(z) z + ) hij = 0 .

(66)

(67)

|| h||2 = z dz e2a(z) hijh ij .

z dz h(z)2   ,
z dz e2a(z) h(z)2  nite .

(70)

(71)

in terms of hij(z) = eipx e3a/2 hij, this becomes

(cid:18)2

a(z)2 +

a(z)(cid:19) hij(z) = p2hij(z) .

(68)

4a(z)2 + 3

this has the same form as a hamiltonian in quantum mechanics, with a potential
v (z) = 9
2a(z) and p2 as the energy eigenvalue. one can easily check that
it factorizes
(cid:18)(z +

a(z))(cid:19) hij(z) = p2hij(z) .

a(z))(z +

(69)

in at space, these terms are one anothers adjoint, and (69) can be regarded as a
factorization of the hamiltonian into qq. this is supersymmetric quantum mechanics,
and the transformed graviton wave-function is the supersymmetric ground state.

we are interested in functions hij that are normalizable on our curved background.
in conformally at coordinates, the measure is e5a(z) dz. in terms of the hij(z), we
have the norm

the decomposition (69) tells us that there is no solution h(z) with p2 < 0 normal-
izable in at space. thus the only solution that could have p2 < 0 would be a h(z)
such that

obviously there is no such h(z) in compact s1/z2 geometries, but in fact there is also
no normalizable h(z) when z has innite range. in this case the asymptotic regions
are anti-de sitter as in (65), and as z  ,
e2a(z) 

l2
z2 .

(72)

where l2

graviton equation (68) reduces to

= 3/v () and  is the asymptotic value of the background scalar. the

hij(z) +(cid:18)p2 

15

4z2(cid:19) hij(z) = 0 .

(73)

for p2 > 0 the solutions for h(z) are ordinary bessel functions z1/2j2(pz) and z1/2y2(pz),
as noted by [1] (in fact the same wave equation was considered earlier in [29]).

for space-like p2 < 0 on the other hand, the solutions are the modied bessel
functions z1/2 i2(|p|z) and z1/2 k2(|p|z), whose large-z expansions have the leading
terms e|p|z, respectively. for these modes to be normalizable with the proper measure,
i.e. the second condition in (71), only the falling exponential is permitted. such a

27

wavefunction would also have convergent norm in the at measure, however, and is
thus ruled out by the supersymmetric quantum mechanics argument. as a result there
can be no normalizable modes with p2 < 0 at all. thus we can state that there are
no transverse traceless modes with space-like momentum that might destabilize the
background solution.

before concluding this section, we briey remark on the non-transverse traceless
components of the metric uctuation, which are coupled to the scalar by the equations
(55), (56), and (57).

it is not easy to solve these coupled equations in general, and we have not attempted
to do so. one simplication which can be made, however, is to eliminate the ijhij
term in (57) using the r55 = t55 equation from (55) and (56). one is left with an
integro-dierential equation involving only  and the background. this equation can
be converted into a third-order ordinary dierential equation for .

we cannot exclude that this equation has normalizable space-like modes, but we sus-
pect not. it seems likely that the boucher non-supersymmetric positive-energy theorem
[30, 31] can be extended to include actions such as ours with potentials localized on
hypersurfaces, in which case stability would be guaranteed for our solutions, by virtue
of their satisfying the rst-order equations. this question is yet to be fully addressed.

note added

as this manuscript was nearing completion, several papers appeared [32, 33, 34, 35]
which overlap somewhat with our results. for instance, (14) was also derived in [35],
and the ds4 solution in (30) was also obtained in [32]. in [34], solutions similar to the
single domain wall of section 5 were shown to emerge from a u(1) gauged supergravity
theory.
