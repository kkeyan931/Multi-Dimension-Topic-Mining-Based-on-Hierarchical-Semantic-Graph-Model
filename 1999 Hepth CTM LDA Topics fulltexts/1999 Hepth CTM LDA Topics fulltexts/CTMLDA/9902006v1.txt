abstract

following the subtraction procedure for manifolds with boundaries, we cal-

culate by variational methods, the schwarzschild and flat space energy dif-

ference. the one loop approximation for tt tensors is considered here. an

analogy between the computed energy dierence in momentum space and the

casimir eect is illustrated. we nd a singular behaviour in the uv-limit,

due to the presence of the horizon when r = 2m. when r > 2m this singu-

lar behaviour disappears, which is in agreement with various other models

previously presented.

i. introduction

an interesting problem appearing in einstein gravity is the computation of quantum

corrections to a classical energy. a possible approach is the analysis of the thermodynamical

quantities that characterize the system under consideration. this analysis can be carried

1

out by computing the system free energy at a given volume and temperature, by means

of a partition function and the euclidean action. following the background method, we

x a metric and look at quantum uctuations with respect to such a background with the

appropriate boundary conditions, then we functionally integrate such metric uctuations

which are strictly periodic in euclidean time t. in particular, the only feasible way to treat

functional integration is by saddle-point methods. this is adequate for the treatment of the

small perturbation concerning minkowski space and for a semiclassical analysis of vacuum

stability. however, a dierent point of view based on the hamiltonian approach, could be

considered. in this framework, quantum corrections to a classical energy can be computed

by means of expectation values of the total hamiltonian with respect to some states. it is

clear that the problem is too large to be completely solved. to this end we might take into

consideration the simplest non trivial saddle-point we can extract from vacuum einstein

equations, the schwarzschild solution

ds2 = (cid:18)1 

2m g

r (cid:19) dt2 +(cid:18)1 

2m g

r (cid:19)1

dr2 + r2d2,

(1)

where d2 = d2 + sin2 d2 is the line element of the unit sphere, g is newtons constant

and m is a parameter representing the mass of the wormhole. this metric is asymptotically

at. the apparent singularity located at r = 2m g can be removed by a suitable denition

of the coordinates, e.g., the kruskal-szekeres coordinates, which is written as

(cid:16) r
2m g  1(cid:17) exp(cid:16) r
2m g(cid:17) = x

exp(cid:16) t

y

2m g(cid:17) = xy

.



(2)

(3)

in terms of these coordinates we have

ds2 =

32 (m g)3

r

exp(cid:18)

r

2m g(cid:19) dxdy + r2d2.

the only true singularities are at curves xy = 1, where r = 0. the region {x > 0, y > 0}
is the outside region, the only region from which distant observers can obtain any infor-

mation. the line y = 0, where r = 2m g, is the future horizon; the line x = 0 where also

r = 2m g, is the past horizon. we will consider a slice  of the schwarzschild manifold

2

representing a constant time section of m. this surface  is an einstein-rosen bridge with
wormhole topology s2  r1 which denes a bifurcation surface, dividing  in two parts de-
noted by + and . our purpose is to consider perturbations at  with t constant, which

naturally dene quantum uctuations of the einstein-rosen bridge. in particular we will

focus our attention on the + sector of the manifold, corresponding to the outside region

of the kruskal manifold. the explicit expression of the hamiltonian can be calculated by

considering the line element

ds2 = n 2(cid:16)dx0(cid:17)2

+ gij(cid:16)n idx0 + dxi(cid:17)(cid:16)n jdx0 + dxj(cid:17) ,

(4)

where n is called the lapse function and ni is the shift function. when n = q1  2m g
r (cid:17)1
ni = 0 and gijdxidxj = (cid:16)1  2m g

dr2 + r2d2, we recover the schwarzschild solution.

on the slice , deviations from the schwarzschild metric spatial section will be considered

,

r

gij = gij + hij,

with ni = 0 and n  n (r). then the line element (4) becomes

ds2 = n 2 (r)(cid:16)dx0(cid:17)2

+ gijdxidxj

and the total hamiltonian is

ht = h + h =z

d3x(nh+nihi) + h,

where

hi = 2ij

|j (super momentum),

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

while h represents the energy stored in the boundaries. in this respect, we will follow the

adm approach [7], even though the quasilocal energy context gives a more general treat-
ment with the possibility of looking at the gravitational thermodynamics [4,5]. moreover,

3

since the space under investigation is asymptotically at in spacelike directions, the quasilo-

cal energy agrees with the results of the adm approach in the limit that the boundary
tends to spatial innity. in any case, to correctly compute h = hadm we have to x

a reference frame to normalize the energy value on the boundary to zero. this opens the

problem of the subtraction procedure investigated in refs. [5,6]. in this paper we would

like to apply such a procedure extended to the volume term, at least at one loop. since

the reference space for the schwarzschild metric is at space, the contribution to the energy

term is

hadm = lim

rzqbgbgij [bgik,j bgij,k] dsk = m

(10)

where bgij is the metric induced on a spacelike hypersurface  which has a boundary at

innity like s2. following the result of ref. [6], we see that hadm is completely equivalent

to

1

(11)

where the subtraction structure is evident. the one-loop contribution to the zero point

energy for gravitons embedded in at space is

(2)3

(12)

it is clear that this term is uv divergent. we will show that the same kind of divergence is

present when the curved background is considered. in the spirit of the subtraction procedure

we will compute the dierence between zero point energies. their dierence at one loop

represents a casimir-like computation. the paper is structured as follows, in section ii we

dene the gaussian wave functional for gravity and we analyze the orthogonal decomposition

of the metric deformations, in section iii we give some of the basic rules to perform the

functional integration and we dene the hamiltonian approximated up to second order, in

section iv, we analyze the spin-two operator acting on transverse traceless tensors, only for

positive values of e2. we summarize and conclude in section v.

ii. energy density calculation in schr odinger

representation

as already mentioned, we would like to discuss the possibility of generalizing the bound-

ary subtraction procedure. to this end, by looking at the hamiltonian structure, we see

that there are two classical constraints

which are satised both by the schwarzschild and flat metric and two quantum constraints

,

(13)

.

(14)

h  = 0
hi  = 0

h = 0
hi = 0



 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) e

h  = 0 is known as the wheeler-dewitt equation (wdw). nevertheless, we are interested
in assigning a meaning to

d(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)h schw.

where  is a wave functional whose structure will be determined later and h schw.



is the total hamiltonian referred to the dierent spacetimes for the volume term. this

has to be meant in this way:

it is true that the wdw equation refers to the space of

metrics, but the space of metrics posses dierent sectors [1] and we are considering the

sector of asymptotically at metrics, in which the zero point energy is dened with respect

to minkowski space. for the de sitter sector, we have to substract the energy of de sitter

background and so on. note that if the expectation value is calculated on the wave functional

solution of the wdw equation, we obtain only the boundary contribution. however, in this

context boundaries are at innity in spacelike directions, that it is equivalent to considering

the unphysical situation of computing energy excitation in the asymptotic region. then

to give meaning to (15), we adopt the semiclassical strategy of the wkb expansion. by

observing that the kinetic part of the super hamiltonian is quadratic in the momenta, we

expand the three-scalar curvature r d3xgr(3) up to o (h3) and we get

will consider   c exp (is).
substituted by a trial wave functional according to the variational approach we would like

in this context, the approximated wave functional will be

to implement as regards this problem.

iii. the gaussian wave functional for tt tensors

to actually make such calculations, we need an orthogonal decomposition for both ij and

hij to disentangle gauge modes from physical deformations. we dene the inner product

hh, ki :=zm

ggijklhij (x) kkl (x) d3x,

(17)

by means of the inverse wdw metric gijkl, to have a metric on the space of deformations,

i.e. a quadratic form on the tangent space at h, with

gijkl = (gikgjl + gilgjk  2gijgkl).

the inverse metric is dened on co-tangent space and it assumes the form

hp, qi :=zm

ggijklpij (x) qkl (x) d3x,

so that

gijnmgnmkl =

1

2(cid:16)i

kj

l + i

l j

k(cid:17) .

(18)

(19)

(20)

note that in this scheme the inverse metric is actually the wdw metric dened on

phase space. now, we have the desired decomposition on the tangent space of 3-metric

deformations [2,3]:

hij =

1
3

hgij + (l)ij + h

ij

(21)

where the operator l maps i into symmetric tracefree tensors

6

(l)ij = ij + ji 

2
3

gij (  ) .

then the inner product between three-geometries becomes

ggijklhij (x) hkl (x) d3x =

hh, hi := zm
g(cid:20)
zm

2
3

h2 + (l)ij (l)ij + hijh

ij(cid:21) .

(22)

(23)

with the orthogonal decomposition in hand we can dene a vacuum trial state

 [hij (x )] = n exp(

4l2

p (cid:20)dhk 1he

x,y

+d(l) k 1 (l)ek

x,y

+dhk 1het race

x,y

(cid:21)) ,

(24)

which will be used as a probe for the gravitational ground state. this particular expression

is useful because the functional can be represented as a product of three functionals dened

on the decomposed tensor eld

 [hij (x )] = n hh

ij (x )i h(l)iji (cid:20)1

3

gijh (x )(cid:21) .

(25)

h
ij is the tracefree-transverse part of the 3d quantum eld, (l)ij is the longitudinal part
h,ix,y denotes space integration and
k 1 is the inverse propagator containing variational parameters. the main reason for a

and nally h is the trace part of the same eld.

similar ansatz comes from the observation that the quadratic part in the momenta of the

hamiltonian decouples in the same way of eq.(23). note that the decomposition related to

the momenta is independent of the choice of the functional. to calculate the energy density,

we need to know the action of some basic operators on  [hij]. the action of the operator

hij on |i =  [hij] is realized by

hij (x)|i = hij (x )  [hij] .

the action of the operator ij on |i, in general, is

ij (x)|i = i



hij (x )

 [hij] .

the inner product is dened by the functional integration:

7

(26)

(27)

h1 | 2i =z [dhij] 

1 {hij} 2 {hkl} ,

and the energy eigenstates satisfy the stationary schrodinger equation:

z d3xh(i



hij (x )

, hij (x )) {hij} = e{hij} ,

(28)

(29)

where hni



hij (x) , hij (x)o is the hamiltonian density. note that the previous equation

in the general context of einstein gravity is devoid of meaning, because of the constraints.

however in the semiclassical context, we can give a meaning to eq.(29), where a semiclassical

time is introduced in the same manner of refs. [12,14]. there, a schrodinger equation of

the form

i


t

= h|2

(30)

is recovered by the wdw equation approximated to second order for a perturbed minisu-

perspace friedmann model without boundary terms. when asymptotically at boundary

terms are present we have to take account of such contributions in the wkb expansion

such as in ref. [13]. however in this paper only gravitational transverse-traceless modes are

considered on the xed curved background and  is substituted by a trial wave functional.

to further proceed, instead of solving (29), which is of course impossible, we can formulate

the same problem by means of a variational principle. we demand that

h | h | i
h | i

= r hdg

ijir d3x
r hdg

1ng
ijohng

(31)

be stationary against arbitrary variations of {hij}. the form of h | h | i can be com-
puted as follows. we dene normalized mean values

(32)

(33)

it follows that, by dening h

ij = gij  gij, we have

z hdh

(35)

(36)

nevertheless, the application of the variational principal on arbitrary wave functional does

not improve the situation described by the eq.(29). to this purpose, we give to the trial

wave functional the form

iji = n exp(

(38)

(39)

choice (37) is related to the form of the hamiltonian approximated to quadratic order in

the metric deformations.

indeed, up to this order we have a harmonic oscillator whose

ground state has a gaussian form. by means of decomposition (21), we extract the tt

sector contribution in the previous expression. moreover, the functional representation (25)

eliminates every interaction between gauge and the other terms. then for the tt sector

(spin-two), one gets

iv. the spectrum of the spin-2 operator and the evaluation

of the energy density in momentum space

the spin-two operator is dened by

(2)a

j := a

j + 2ra

j

(43)

where  is the curved laplacian (laplace-beltrami operator) on a schwarzschild background
and ra

is the mixed ricci tensor whose components are:

j = diag(2m

,

m

r3) ,

(44)

where 2m = 2m g. this operator is similar to the lichnerowicz operator provided that we

substitute the riemann tensor with the ricci tensor. this is essentially due to the fact that

the riemann tensor in three-dimensions is a linear combination of the ricci tensor. in (45)

the ricci tensor acts as a potential on the space of tt tensors; for this reason we are led to

study the following eigenvalue equation

(cid:16)a

j + 2ra

a = e2hi

j

j(cid:17) hi

(45)

where e2 is the eigenvalue of the corresponding equation.

in doing so, we follow regge

and wheeler in analyzing the equation as modes of denite frequency, angular momentum

and parity. we can specialize to the case with the quantum number corresponding to the

projection of the angular momentum on the z-axis is zero, without altering the contribution

10

to the total energy because of the spherical symmetry of the problem. in this case, regge-

wheeler decomposition [11] shows that the even-parity three-dimensional perturbation is

(68)

remark we would like to explain the reasons that support the results of formula (65). in

that formula we introduced a particular value of the radius, which behaves as a regulator

with respect to the horizon approach of the potential. the meaning of this particular value

is related to the necessity of explaining the dynamical origin of black hole entropy by the

entanglement entropy mechanism and by the so-called brick wall model [9,10]. indeed,

1it is known that at one-loop level gravity is renormalizable only in at space. in a dimensional

regularization scheme its contribution to the action is, on shell, proportional to the euler character

of the manifold that is nonzero for the schwarzschild instanton. although in our approach we are

working with sections of the original manifold to deal with these divergences one must introduce a

regulator that indeed appears in the contribution of energy density.

14

the same mechanism is present when one has to regularize entropy by imposing a kind of

cut-o, which in coordinate space means r0 > 2m. in fact, r0 can be seen as 2m + h, where

h assumes the same meaning of ref. [9]. however, to explicitly relate this quantity we have

to compare the bekenstein-hawking entropy with the result deriving from the evaluation of

the free energy for gravitons, in this case. the only dierence from the original calculation

is the spin contribution not present for scalar elds.

v. summary and conclusions

we started from the problem of dening quantum corrections (semiclassical) to a grav-

itational energy. by means of a variational approach with gaussian wave functionals an

attempt to calculate such a correction was made. despite the constraint equations, this

calculation is based on an extension of the subtraction procedure involving volume terms in

the semiclassical regime. excitations coming from boundary terms have been neglected to

avoid the unphysical situation of having contributions deriving from innity. in this context

the extended subtraction procedure corresponds to the dierence between zero point ener-

gies calculated in an asymptotically at curved background referring to a at background.

this procedure eliminates the uv divergence of the free gravitons leaving the contribution

of the curved background related to an imposed by hand uv cut-o. a strong analogy with

the casimir vacuum energy calculation is revealed, opening the possibility of understanding

several congurations and their relationship with the vacuum stability. indeed, this appa-

ratus can be applied also to the schwarzschild-desitter background which asymptotically

approaches the desitter space and so on. although this evaluation has to be completed with

a careful study of the spin-two operator, we can conclude that the variational approach for

the computation of quantum corrections (semiclassical) to a classical energy can be thought

of as a tool for testing zero point energy (casimir-like energy) in a complicated theory such

as einstein gravity

because of the vanishing of the weyl tensor in 3d, that is c l

ijm = 0, the riemann

tensor is completely determined by the ricci tensor

appendix b: the kinetic term

the schrodinger picture representation of the kinetic term is

gijklijkl = gijkl

hij (x) hkl (x)! .

(b1)

we have to apply this quantity to the gaussian wave functional |i. this means that

ij (x) kl (x)|i =

hij (x) hkl (x)

 k 1(ij)(kl) (x, y) hkl (y)  [h] .

by functional integrating

h|hkl (y) hkl (y)| i = k(kl)(kl) (y, y)h|i .

thus

becomes
