freed, harvey, minasian and moore have proposed a mechanism to cancel the grav-

itational anomaly of the m-theory vebrane coming from dieomorphisms acting on the

normal bundle. this procedure is based on a modication of the conventional m-theory

chern-simons term. we compactify this space-time interaction to the ten-dimensional

type iia theory. we then analyze the relation to the anomaly cancellation mechanism for

the type iia vebrane proposed by witten.

1. introduction

in our journey towards m-theory there appears an object that for a long time has been

considered to be rather mysterious, the m-theory vebrane or m5-brane. the m5-brane

was discovered for the rst time as a solution to the classical equations of motion of eleven-

dimensional supergravity [1]. the vebrane mystery originated in part because people

did not know how to write down an action for this six-dimensional theory of (2, 0) antisym-

metric tensor-multiplets. this problem has been solved in [2] and [3] for the case of one

single vebrane. however, the action for n coincident m5-branes is still not known because

apparently it is not possible to write down the action for a theory of non-abelian tensor-

multiplets. for a recent discussion on the subject see [4]. progress towards understanding

this system was made by harvey, minasian and moore [5] who computed the gravitational

anomalies of the non-abelian tensor-multiplet theory through anomaly cancellation of a

system of n coincident m5-branes. the calculation of [5] is based on the anomaly cancel-

lation mechanism for a single m5-brane proposed by freed, harvey, minasian and moore

(fhmm) [6]. some earlier attempts to understand anomaly cancellation for the m5-brane

were made in [7], [8] and [9].

the perturbative anomaly cancellation for a single vebrane in type iia theory was

found by witten [10] who suggested an anomaly cancellation mechanism based on a ve-

brane worldvolume counterterm. since the type iia theory is dual to m-theory com-

pactied on a circle we expect that both anomaly cancellation mechanisms are related by

compactication. it is the purpose of this note to understand the relation between both

mechanisms. in section 2 we review some basic ideas which one has to keep in mind for

the next sections. in section 3 we will start with the technically simpler case of a chiral

string in ve dimensions. here the normal bundle is described by an so(3) gauge theory.

this string originates in compactications of m-theory on a calabi-yau manifold when the

m5-brane wraps a non-trivial four-cycle of the calabi-yau. it can potentially have gauge

and gravitational anomalies. we will show that after compactication to four dimensions

the fhmm chern-simons term gives a string worldvolume counterterm that cancels the

four-dimensional anomaly. this exactly coincides with the lower-dimensional version of the

anomaly cancellation mechanism proposed in [10]. in section 4 we consider the m5-brane,

1

where the normal bundle is described by an so(5) gauge theory. the basic idea is the

same as in the simpler string example. after compactication to ten dimensions we will

obtain the vebrane worldvolume counterterm of [10]. our conclusions are presented in

section 5 and some useful formulas are collected in an appendix. in this paper we will study

perturbative anomalies. the calculation of global anomalies in m-theory still remains an

open question.

2. the fivebrane gravitational anomaly

the question that was answered in [11], [10], [6] and [5] is whether the low energy

eective action of m-theory is well dened even in the presence of extended objects. the

extended objects of m-theory are membranes and vebranes. there are no perturbative

anomalies associated with membrane zero-modes because membranes are odd-dimensional

and the worldvolume theory is non-chiral. so the only possible anomalies related to mem-

brane zero-modes are global. their cancellation has been shown in [12]. the situation

is very dierent for the vebrane because the worldvolume is even-dimensional and the

worldvolume theory is chiral. potentially one could have perturbative anomalies and a

calculation is needed to see if these indeed cancel. the m5-brane is a six manifold w6

embedded in an eleven manifold. this breaks the lorentz symmetry to so(5, 1)  so(5).

for the low energy eective action of m-theory to be well dened, dieomorphisms which

map the vebrane into itself should be a symmetry of the theory. these are either dif-

feomorphisms of the vebrane worldvolume or so(5) gauge transformations acting on the

normal bundle. there are several sources for anomalies. first, there are chiral zero-modes

that live on the vebrane worldvolume. for a single vebrane these zero-modes form a

tensor-multiplet of six-dimensional (2, 0) supersymmetry. the chiral elds of this multi-

plet consist of a chiral fermion transforming in the spinor representation of so(5) and a

two-form potential with anti-self-dual eld strength which is a singlet under so(5). the

anomaly can be calculated with the descent formalism. it is expressed in terms of an eight-
form, i8 = di (0)

and the gauge transformation is given by i (0)

7

7 = di (1)

6 . the anomaly is

2

then given by a six-form on the vebrane worldvolume whose explicit form appears in [10]

2zw6

i zm(1)
6

.

(2.1)

the second source of anomalies comes from chern-simons couplings of the bulk theory

zm11

g4  i b
7.

(2.2)

here g4 is the four-form eld strength and i b

7 is a gravitational chern-simons seven-

form that can be expressed in terms of the eleven-dimensional riemann tensor. this

interaction was discovered in [13] by a one-loop calculation in type iia string theory and

in [14] from anomaly cancellation of the tangent bundle. in the presence of vebranes the

gauge invariance of this coupling is broken. under innitesimal dieomorphisms xi 

xi + vi where  is an innitesimal parameter and v is a vector eld, i b

7 transforms as

7 + di b(1)

6

i b
7  i b
integrating by parts we obtain

, where i b(1)

6

is a six-form. taking the gauge variation of (2.2) and

s = zm11

dg4  i b(1)

6

.

(2.3)

in the presence of vebranes the four-form is no longer closed but roughly speaking obeys

the bianchi identity

dg4 = 25.

(2.4)

here 5 is a ve-form which integrates to one in the directions transverse to the vebrane

and has a delta function support on the vebrane. the total gravitational anomaly was

computed in [10] with some standard formulas appearing in [15]

2zw6 (cid:0)i zm

6 + i b

6(cid:1)(1)

= 2zw6 (cid:18) p2(n )

24 (cid:19)(1)

.

(2.5)

here p2(n ) is the second pontrjagin class of the normal bundle. this is in agreement with

the result found in [14] who checked that the anomaly in dieomorphisms of the tangent

bundle cancel.

a new mechanism was needed to cancel the remaining anomaly. until this point there

exist two mechanisms in the literature that do not seem to have an obvious relationship.

3

first, witten [10] introduced a counterterm that lives on the vebrane worldvolume and

that cancels the anomaly in dieomorphisms of the normal bundle for the ten-dimensional

type iia theory. this mechanism did not seem to have an obvious generalization to m5-

branes [10]. on the other hand there exists the mechanism proposed in [6] that is useful

for m5-branes. it is based on a modication of the eleven-dimensional chern-simons term.

here we will show that both mechanisms are not dierent after all. we will see that the

compactication of the modied eleven-dimensional chern-simons term of [6] to ten di-

mensions gives two contributions. first, a modied ten-dimensional chern-simons term

that is gauge invariant and ensures the compatibility between the ten-dimensional bianchi

identity and the equations of motion. second, the vebrane worldvolume counterterm

proposed in [10] which cancels the ten-dimensional anomaly. let us start with the techni-

cally simpler case of a chiral string in ve dimensions which captures the essence of this

calculation.

3. the chiral string or so(3) gauge theory

consider a compactication of m-theory on a calabi-yau threefold. when the m5-

brane wraps a non-trivial four-cycle of the calabi-yau there appears a chiral string in ve

dimensions that can have both gauge and gravitational anomalies. it was shown in [6] that

in ve dimensions these anomalies actually cancel. we will show that after compactication

to four dimensions the fhmm chern-simons term [6] will give at least two contributions.

first, a string worldvolume counterterm that cancels the gravitational anomaly coming

from dieomorphisms of the so(2) normal bundle. this worldvolume counterterm is the

lower-dimensional version of the vebrane worldvolume counterterm found in [10]. second,

a modied four-dimensional chern-simons term which is gauge invariant. this will ensure

the compatibility between the four-dimensional equations of motion and the corresponding

bianchi identity. let us see how this works in more detail.

3.1. the string in five dimensions

this case was worked out in [6] and we will follow closely their discussion. consider

a string in ve dimensions located at yi = 0 for i = 1, 2, 3. the theory along the string

4

has some properties of gravity coupled to an so(3) gauge theory. a natural ansatz for the

ve-dimensional bianchi identity would be

dg2 = (y1)(y2)(y3)dy1  dy2  dy3.

(3.1)

here g2 is the two-form eld strength which couples to the string1. however, the expres-

sion (3.1) is not well dened when one is dealing with interactions that are non-linear in the
eld strength. so for example, order (0)2-terms may appear when one is checking the su-
persymmetry of the lagrangian. the appearance of (0)2-contributions in the lagrangian

was discussed some time ago in [16] for compactications of m-theory on a manifold with

boundary. in fact, there are some striking similarities between both theories. as in the

formula above, the bianchi identity of [16] contains a delta function whose support is at
the boundary of space-time. according to [16] the appearance of (0)2-terms is a symptom

of attempting to treat in classical supergravity what really should be treated in quantum

m-theory. in other words, some degrees of freedom are missing in the classical picture.

in the case at hand the authors of [6] made a clever proposal in order to eectively in-

clude the missing degrees of freedom. fhmm proposed to smooth out the ve-dimensional

bianchi identity by making the following ansatz

dg2 = d 

e2
2

.

(3.2)

the right hand side of this identity is the so-called thom class of the normal bundle [17].

 = (r) is a smooth function of the radial direction away from the string. it takes values

(r) = 1 for suciently small r and (r) = 0 for suciently large r. the delta function

of (3.1) can be obtained as a limiting function of the bump form d. the global angular

form e2 has integral two over the ber and is closed

de2 = 0,

(3.3)

because the euler class of an odd bundle is zero. the explicit form of e2 can be found in

the appendix of [6]2:

e2 =

1
4

abc(cid:0)dyadyb yc  f ab yc(cid:1) .

(3.4)

1 here and in the following we absorb a factor 1/2 in eld strengths and potentials.
2 this corrects a factor 2 in [6]. this factor has to be corrected in the explicit expressions of

all angular forms appearing in [6] and [5].

5

here ya = ya/r for a = 1, 2, 3 are the coordinates on the ber. using the connection

ab = ba one can dene a covariant derivative

and a two-form

dya = dya  ab yb,

f ab = dab  ac  cb.

(3.5)

(3.6)

formula (3.4) is gauge invariant under the so(3) gauge transformations generated by 

ab = (d)ab

and

 ya = ab yb.

(3.7)

an equivalent formula for e2 which will turn out to be useful for explicit calculations is

e2 =

1
4

abc(cid:2)dyadyb yc  d(cid:0)ab yc(cid:1)(cid:3) ,

(3.8)

which is identical to the expression for e2 appearing in [18] that we have collected in the

appendix.

since the angular form is closed and gauge invariant one can apply the descent for-

malism

e2 = de(0)
1

and

e(0)

1 = de(1)
0 .

(3.9)

one can now use the above forms to nd the solution to the bianchi identity and the

ve-dimensional chern-simons term. the solution to the bianchi identity (3.2) which is

non-singular on the string is given by

g2 = dc1 

1
2

d  e(0)
1 .

(3.10)

performing a gauge transformation and demanding that g2 should be invariant one obtains

that c1 transforms under gauge transformations of the normal bundle

c1 = 

1
2

d e(1)
0 .

(3.11)

in order to have compatibility between the equations of motion and the bianchi iden-

tity (3.2) one has to correct the space-time action. fhmm proposed that one way of doing

this is by introducing a modied chern-simons term

scs = 12d lim

0zm5d(w2)

(c1  1)  d (c1  1)  d (c1  1) .

(3.12)

6

here the integration is over the ve-dimensional space-time without a tubular region of
radius  around the string, 1 = e(0)

1 /2 and d is a constant related to the central charge

of the system whose precise denition can be found in [19] and [6].

the chern-simons interaction is not gauge invariant because of the gauge transfor-

mation

(c1  1) = 

1
2

d(e(1)

0 ).

the variation of the chern-simons interaction is then given by a boundary term

scs = 6d lim

0zs(w2)

0 (cid:18)g2 
e(1)

e2(cid:19)2

1
2

,

(3.13)

(3.14)

after applying stokes theorem. here one has to use the fact that the boundary of the

ve-dimensional space without the tubular region d(w2) is an s2-sphere bundle over the

worldvolume of the string w2. this is denoted as s(w2). since g2 and  are smooth

functions near the brane one obtains in the limit of small 

scs = 

3
2

dz s(w2)

e2e2e(1)

0 = 3dzw2

p(1)
1 (n ).

(3.15)

the relevant formula used to carry out the remaining integration is collected in the ap-

pendix. the above anomaly precisely cancels the contributions from chiral zero-modes

plus anomaly inow coming from bulk interactions.

3.2. compactication to four dimensions

this is the lower-dimensional counterpart of the vebrane in ten dimensions that was

considered by witten [10]. the string in four dimensions is described by a one-form eld

strength and a zero-form potential. the fhmm bianchi identity for this case is

dh1 =

1
2

d(e1).

e1 is the so(2) invariant global angular form which satises

de1 = 2(f ),

7

(3.16)

(3.17)

where (f ) = abf ab/4 is the euler class of the so(2) bundle. from (3.16) we see that

the bianchi identity on the brane is given by

dh1|w2 = (f ),

which is equivalent to the bianchi identity used in [10]3. the explicit form of e1 is

e1 = 

1


ab(dy)a yb = 

1


ab(cid:18)dya yb 

1
2

ab(cid:19) .

in order to make contact with the formalism of [10] we can locally write

e1/2 = d0 + 1,

where d0 describes the volume term on the ber and

1 =

1
4

abab,

(3.18)

(3.19)

(3.20)

(3.21)

lives on the string worldvolume. this last quantity is the chern-simons one-form in terms

of which the euler character takes the form (f ) = d1. under a gauge transformation

we then have

1 = d

with

 =

1
4

abab,

(3.22)

where  is again the generator of the gauge transformation. furthermore since e1 is gauge

invariant we obtain

0 = .

(3.23)

using the forms 0 and 1 it is easy to nd the non-singular solution of the bianchi

identity. it is given by

h1 = db0 + 1  d0.

(3.24)

note that a term of the form e1 is not allowed since e1 is singular on the brane. to see

this note that the integral of e1 over the ber is non-vanishing even if the volume of the

3

in order to relate the present formulation with the one of [10] one has to change the sign of

. this explains the minus sign in front of (f ) in formula (3.18).

8

ber tends to zero. since h1 should be gauge invariant under the so(2) transformations

of the normal bundle we see that b0 has a transformation

b0 = .

(3.25)

let us now work out the relation between the 5d and 4d chern-simons terms. for

that purpose we would like to consider an so(3) bundle n of the form n = n   o,

where n  is an so(2) bundle and o is a trivial bundle. we will then assume that the

3-component of all connections is equal to zero, 3a = 0 for a = 1, 2. the expression for

e2 then becomes

e2 =

1
2

  (f )y3 +

1
4

ababdy3,

(3.26)

where  is the volume element of the so(3) ber. next, notice that the ve-dimensional

anomaly followed from the bott and cattaneo formula

e3

2 = 2p1(n ),

(3.27)

where  denotes the integration over the ber. inserting (3.26) into this expression one
obtains after integration over the ber p1(n ) = (f )2, which is the correct relation

between the rst pontrjagin class and the euler class of an even bundle. the formula that

fhmm actually used to compute the ve-dimensional anomaly is

[e2e2e(1)

0 ] = 2p(1)

1 (n ).

(3.28)

in four dimensions the rst pontrjagin class is p1(n ) = (f )2 = d(1(f )). after a gauge

transformation the right hand side of the previous equation becomes (1(f )) = d().
this determines p(1)
1 (n ) = (f ). this is an important piece of information because
this together with (3.26) and (3.28) determines the value of e(1)
0

e(1)
0 = 

3
2

 y3.

(3.29)

this choice guarantees that the integration over the ber correctly reproduces the value
of p(1)

1 (n )

[e2e2e(1)

0 ] = 2p(1)

1 (n ) = 2(f ).

(3.30)

9

such a choice is always possible because e(0)
1

is only determined up to a total derivative.

the gauge transformation of the potential appearing in the chern-simons term (3.12) is

then a total derivative

(c1  1) = 

1
2

d(e(1)

0 ) =

3
4

d( y3).

(3.31)

this can be easily expressed in terms of the gauge transformation of the four-

dimensional b0 eld (3.25), so that we can identify

c1  1 =

3
4

d(b0 y3) + i,

(3.32)

where i represents gauge invariant terms. the anomalous contribution to the chern-

simons term is then given by

sa

cs = lim
0

9dzm5d(w2 )

d(b0 y3)(g2 

1
2

e2)(g2 

1
2

e2)

using stokes theorem we see that sa

cs is a boundary term

9d lim

0zs(w2)

b0 y3(g2 

1
2

e2)(g2 

1
2

e2).

(3.33)

(3.34)

since the elds b0 and g2 are smooth near the string we obtain after carrying out the

limit and the integration over the ber



9
4

d lim

0zs(w2)

b0e2e2 y3 = 3dzw2

b0(f ) = 3dzw2

h11.

(3.35)

to carry out the integration over the ber we have used (3.26) and formula (6.6) of the

appendix. the result (3.35) is precisely the lower-dimensional analogue of the worldvolume

counterterm proposed by witten for the case of the type iia vebrane [10].

in addition there are four-dimensional space-time interactions which are invariant

under gauge transformations of the normal bundle. we will not determine invariant terms

by a direct calculation because even in 5d the complete set of invariant terms is not known.

this would require a microscopic derivation of the interaction presented by fhmm. this

derivation is still missing. however, in order to have a consistent 4d theory we expect an

additional term in space-time of the form

zm4

c1(h1 

1
2

e1)g2.

10

(3.36)

this can be easily seen because once the bianchi identities are modied h1 is no longer

closed. replacing h1 by h1e1/2 guarantees that the bianchi identities and the equations

of motion of this theory are compatible.

4. the fivebrane or so(5) gauge theory

4.1. the fivebrane in m-theory

the problem of cancelling the anomaly coming from dieomorphisms of the normal

bundle of an m5-brane was solved in [6]. considering the m5-brane is completely analogous

to the chiral string in 5d that we discussed in the previous section. the vebrane in eleven

dimensions breaks the so(10, 1) lorentz symmetry to so(5, 1)  so(5). therefore the

normal bundle is described by an so(5) gauge theory.

the m5-brane couples to a four-form eld strength g4 with a three-form potential

c3. the fhmm bianchi identity for this case is

the explicit form of e4 is given by

dg4 = d 

e4
2

.

e4 =

1

322 a1...a5h(dy)a1 (dy)a2(dy)a3 (dy)a4 ya5
 2f a1a2 (dy)a3 (dy)a4 ya5 + f a1a2 f a3a4 ya5i,

(4.1)

(4.2)

where ai, i = 1, . . . , 5 labels the ber coordinates. one can again apply the descent for-

malism and introduce the notations

e4 = de(0)
3

and

e(0)

3 = de(1)
2 .

(4.3)

the eleven-dimensional fhmm chern-simons term is

scs = 

2
6

lim

0zm11d(w6)

(c3  3)  d(c3  3)  d(c3  3),

(4.4)

where 3 = e(0)

3 /2. this term is not invariant under dieomorphisms. its variation is

obtained by using the anomalous gauge transformation of c3 which determines

(c3  3) = d(e(1)

2 /2).

(4.5)

11

the result for the gauge transformation of the action is then

scs = 



24 zs(w6)

e4e4e(1)

2 = 



12 zw6

p(1)
2 (n ).

(4.6)

the last identity can be obtained by using the corresponding version of the formulas by

bott and catteneo [18]. we have collected the relevant formulas in the appendix.

4.2. compactication to ten dimensions

the anomaly cancellation for the vebrane in type iia theory has been veried in

[10]. in ten dimensions the vebrane is described by a three-form eld strength h3 with a

two-form potential b2. the modied bianchi identity is

dh3 =

1
2

d(e3).

the angular form e3 is given by

e3 = 

1

22 abcd(cid:20) 1

3

(dy)a(dy)b(dy)c yd 

1
2

f ab(dy)c yd(cid:21) ,

(4.7)

(4.8)

where a = 1, . . . , 4 labels the so(4) ber coordinates. notice that the sign between both

terms is dierent than in the expression given in [5]. this can be written in the form

e3/2 = d2 + 3,

(4.9)

where 2 = 2(yi, ) is a function of the ber and brane coordinates. it contains besides
other terms the volume form of s4. its explicit form is not needed in the following. 3 is

the chern-simons three-form

3 = 

1

322 abcd(cid:18)abdcd 

2
3

abcxxd(cid:19) ,

which is related to the euler class by

(f ) = d3 =

1
322 abcdf ab  f cd.

therefore the global angular form e3 is related to the euler class

de3 = 2(f ),

12

(4.10)

(4.11)

(4.12)

as usual. on the brane we the recover

dh3 |w6= (f ),

(4.13)

which is the bianchi identity used in [10].

after an so(4) gauge transformation with generator  the chern-simons three-form

transforms as a total derivative

3 = d

with

 = 

1
322 abcdabdcd.

(4.14)

in the notation of [10]4 3 = () and  = (, f ). the invariance of e3 implies that

2 has a gauge transformation

2 = .

(4.15)

in the same way as for the chiral string in 4d there is only one solution of the bianchi

identity which is non-singular on the vebrane

h3 = db2 + 3  d  2.

(4.16)

demanding h3 to be gauge invariant we see that b2 must have an anomalous variation

under so(4) transformations

b2 = .

(4.17)

in order to relate the 11d and 10d theories we will assume that the so(5) bundle n is of

the form n = n  + o, where n  is an so(4) bundle and o is trivial. the connections

involving the ve-component are then vanishing. recall that the second pontrjagin class

and the euler class of the so(4) bundle are related as p2(n ) = (f )2, so that we obtain

p2

(1)(n ) = . in order to satisfy the bott and cattaneo formula

[e4e4e(1)

2 ] = 2p2

(1)(n ) = 2(f ),

total derivatives for e(1)

3 have to be chosen in such a way that e2

(1) becomes

e(1)
2 = 45 y5.

4 there is again a change of sign in .

13

(4.18)

(4.19)

to carry out the integration over the ber we have used the formula (6.11) of the appendix.

the so(4) gauge transformation of the potential appearing in the eleven-dimensional

chern-simons term is then

(c3  3) = 

1
2

d(e(1)

2 ) = 

45
2

d( y5).

(4.20)

the anomalous term of the eleven-dimensional chern-simons interaction can be expressed

in terms of the ten-dimensional potential b2 as

c3  3 =

45
2

d(b2 y5) + i,

where i is an invariant under so(4) gauge transformations. because of the appearance

of the total derivative in the previous expression we are able to write the anomalous

contribution to the chern-simons interaction as a boundary term, exactly as we had done

this is precisely the counterterm found by witten [10] that cancels the anomaly from

so(4) transformations of the normal bundle of a type iia vebrane.

of course, as in the lower-dimensional example, in order to have compatibility between

the equations of motion and the bianchi identity (4.7) one should have a modied space-

time chern-simons term of the form

however, this does not contribute to the anomaly because it is gauge invariant. it is very

satisfying to see that in ten dimensions this anomalous contribution to the space-time

interaction can indeed be expressed as a worldvolume counterterm as proposed in [10].

5. conclusion

in this paper we have considered a string and a vebrane embedded in ve and eleven

dimensions respectively. these theories are not invariant under dieomorphisms of the

normal bundle. this results in an anomaly that can be expressed in terms of the corre-

sponding pontrjagin class of the normal bundle. until now there have been two anomaly

cancellation mechanisms in the literature whose relation had not been worked out until

now. the mechanism proposed by freed, harvey, minasian and moore [6] is formulated

for theories with an odd ber dimension while the mechanism proposed by witten [10] is

useful for theories with an even ber dimension. in this paper we saw that both mechanism

are actually not dierent. we have shown that after compactication the fhmm anomaly

cancellation mechanism [6] becomes equivalent to the one proposed in [10]. this is very

satisfactory and provides further understanding of both anomaly cancellation mechanisms.

even thought a microscopic derivation of the fhmm chern-simons term is still miss-

ing we believe that this interaction provides a way of eectively dealing with the presence

of n coincident m5-branes. so for example, the proposed interaction explains the n 3 con-

tributions to the black hole entropy found in [19] from a detailed reduction of the vebrane

tensor-multiplet. the n 3 growth of the entropy of a system of multiple m5-branes was

rst discovered in [20].

the microscopic description of n coincident vebranes is a theory of non-abelian

tensor-multiplets. such a theory does not seem to exist. at least not as a local quantum

eld theory [4]. so the only possibility seems to be a non-local theory. at this point our

most convincing candidate to be a satisfactory formulation of m-theory is matrix theory

[21]. however, it is very hard to describe m5-branes in this approach. it is rather possible

that the nal formulation of m-theory may involve a non-local theory. before trying to

answer this more dicult question it would be important to nd a global formulation

of the mechanism proposed by fhmm. it seems plausible that gerbes [22] might be the

correct framework to address this question. furthermore, freed and witten have computed

global anomalies for type ii theories [23]. maybe an extension of this work to the eleven-

dimensional m-theory is possible. we hope to report on this in a future.

6. appendix

in this appendix we would like to collect some formulas that are useful when computing

the integrals involved in the calculation of the anomalies presented in this paper. we would

like to begin with integrals involving e2. first e2 can be rewritten in the form

e2 =

 + d(c yc)

2

where  is the volume element

 = y1dy2dy3 + y2dy3dy1 + y3dy1dy2,

which satises rs2  = 4 and c = abcab/2. this expression implies

e2 = 2

where by  we denote the integration over the ber. moreover,

(2)2e2

2 =(cid:2)2d(aya) + d(a ya)d(b yb)(cid:3) =

2da(wya)  ab(dyadyb) = 0.

(6.1)

(6.2)

(6.3)

(6.4)

the explicit evaluation of the bott and cattaneo formula goes along the same lines [18]

(2)3e3

2 =(cid:2)3d(a ya)2 + d(a ya)3(cid:3) =

3dadb( ya yb)  3dabc(yadybdyc).

introducing spherical coordinates it is the easy to see that

( ya yb) =

4
3

ab

and

(yadybdyc) =

4
3

abc.

therefore we obtain the equation

e3

2 =

1

22 (cid:0)dada  abcdabc(cid:1) = 2p1.

16

(6.5)

(6.6)

(6.7)

in general pr denote the pontrjagin classes.

the evaluation of these expressions for the so(5) case is, of course, more involved

but in principle straightforward. without repeating the same steps as for the so(3) case

we just state here the results

e4 = 2,

e2

4 = 0

and

e3

4 = 2p2.

(6.8)

if  now denotes the volume form of the s4 ber

 =

4!

a1a2a3a4a5 dya1dya2dya3 dya4 ya5,

with rs4  = 82/3, then

( ya yb) =

8
15

2ab.

(6.9)

(6.10)

this equation implies that after imposing the condition that the 5-component of the con-

nection vanishes we have

(e4e4 y5) =

2
45

(f ),

(6.11)

as a simple evaluation of the involved integrals implies.
