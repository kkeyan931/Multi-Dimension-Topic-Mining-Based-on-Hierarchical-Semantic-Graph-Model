abstract

we study a membrane  anti-membrane system in matrix theory. it in fact

exhibits the tachyon instability. by suitably representing this conguration,

we obtain the (2+1)-dimensional abelian higgs model with an extra coupling.

we can identify the tachyon eld with the higgs eld in this model, thereby it

eventually condenses via the higgs mechanism. we show that there exist vor-

tex solutions which saturate the bogomolnyi bound. they can be interpreted

as gravitons in matrix theory, as discussed by a. sen in the corresponding

type iia string theory.

it is well-known that a tachyon develops when a d-brane and an anti-d-brane come

up to some critical interval of order of string scale [1, 2, 3]. hence the system of a brane

and an anti-brane is unstable, and the tachyon elds roll down to a stable point [5].

recently sen argued that the d-brane  anti-d-brane pair is annihilated via the tachyon

condensation and in this process certain stable d-branes are produced as soliton solutions

on this system [4, 6, 7, 8]. these stable d-branes are basically classied into two classes.

one is stable non-bps d-branes with codimension one [4, 6, 7, 8, 9]. they are stabilized

by certain orbifold or orientifold projections, and can be identied with kink solutions.

the other is bps d-branes with codimension two, and they can be interpreted as vortex

solutions, or kink solutions on unstable d-branes with codimension one, on the brane 

anti-brane pair [6, 8]. both classes of stable d-branes has been understood in terms of the

k-theory in more general way [11], and the author in [12] suggested possible applications

of this line of arguments to matrix theory.

in this paper we study the latter mechanism in matrix theory [13]. we consider
a specic example, a system of membrane  anti-membrane pair,4 in which gravitons
are supposed to be produced as vortex solutions on the membrane worldvolume via the

tachyon condensation:

m2 + m2 hti6=0

graviton (vortex),

where hti denotes the vacuum expectation value of the tachyon elds.
this corresponds to the mechanism in type iia theory [6],

d2 + d2 hti6=0

d0 (vortex) or d0 (anti-vortex).

(1)

(2)

in matrix theory we should not expect the appearance of anti-gravitons (corresponding

to d0 in type iia theory), for the matrix description of m-theory is thought of as an

innite momentum limit or as a light-like limit of m-theory. in fact we will see below that

we cannot have an anti-vortex solution in the matrix calculation.

in string theory the tachyon potential can in principle be computed, but it is hardly

possible to carry it out in all order. in matrix theory, however, we in fact have a simple

tachyon potential of quartic order, due to having taken a special limit of m-theory [14].

now let us see how tachyon modes appear in the background of the m2-m2 pair in matrix

theory, which was studied in detail in [15, 16]. the matrix theory action is

s =

[x i, x j]2 + t dt + it i[xi, ](cid:27) ,

(3)

4hereafter we will denote membranes and anti-membranes as m 2 and m 2 respectively. we will also

use the abbreviation dp and dp respectively for dp-branes and anti-dp-branes.

where r is the radius of a light-like circle and mp is the eleven dimensional planck mass.
we use a convention t  i[a0,] for the covariant derivative dt.
we can express the m2-m2 pair spreading over the (8,9)-directions of interval b in the

7-direction by the background matrices

b8 =   p1

0 p2 ! , b9 =   q1

0

0

0 b ! ,
0 q2 ! , b7 =   0 0

(4)

where pi and qi satisfy the commutation relation [pi, qi] = ic with a constant c which is
a charge density of the membrane [17]. the upper diagonal block corresponds to m2 and

the lower to m2. the background matrices for the other directions, the gauge potential

a0 and the fermions are vanishing. for later use we shall represent pi and qi by

pi = ixi + axi, qi = iyi + ayi,

(5)

with the eld strength fxiyi = xiayi  yiaxi = c. in this representation the trace in the
action is replaced with integrals over xi and yi. for our purpose, we are only interested
in the type of a trace

tr"  dx1 x

x dx2 ! ,  dy1

y  dy2 !#2

y

,

(6)

where dxi and dyi denote, in the representation given in eq. (5), covariant derivatives in
which the gauge elds depend only on x1 and y1 for i = 1, and x2 and y2 for i = 2. we
shall assume that diagonal elements, even the ones obtained as the products of matrices,

are local with respect to the coordinates x1 and y1 for the upper block and x2 and y2
for the lower block, although they are in general bi-local. we will factorize a trace as
tr = tr  tr22, and concentrate on a piece tr. there are three types of traces we have
to consider.

(i) a trace containing only diagonal elements, i.e., covariant derivatives:

tr[dxi, dyi]2 = z dxidyi[dxi, dyi]2.

(ii) two diagonal and two o-diagonal elements. an example is

trdx1y dy2x = z dx1dy1dx2dy2dx1y (x1, y1; x2, y2)dy2x(x1, y1; x2, y2),

(7)

(8)

where  denotes the complex conjugation, and the same rule is applied to the other cases
of this type.

(iii) four o-diagonal elements. an example is

trxy xy  = z dx1dy1dx2dy2dx2dy2x(x1, y1; x2, y2)y (x1, y1; x2, y2)

x(x1, y1; x2, y2)y (x1, y1; x2, y2), (9)

2

and similar results are hold for the other cases.

in order to see the appearance of tachyon modes in this system, it is instructive to

compute the potential between m2 and m2 in the one-loop approximation. it can be

done most easily in the background gauge with the gauge xing term

sgf = 

r3m 6

1

p z dt

1
2

tr(cid:16)ta0 + i[bi, y i](cid:17)2

.

(10)

here the matrices y i denotes the uctuations around the background, that is, x i =
bi + y i. since we know that the tachyon modes would come from the open strings
streched between d2 and d2 in the corresponding type iia picture, it suces to consider

the o-diagonal elements of the uctuation matrices (and ghosts as well):

y i =   0

(i)

i

0 ! , a0 =   0

() 0 ! ,  =   0

()t 0 ! .





then the mass matrices for the o-diagonal uctuations are given by

m 2

i = m 2
m 2

ghosts = b2 + h,

 = m 2
(8,9) =   b2 + h
4ic

(i = 1,   , 7),

4ic

b2 + h ! ,

m = 7b + 8(p1  p 2 ) + 9(q1 + q2),

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

where h = (p1  p 2 )2 + (q1 + q2)2, and it describes the hamiltonian of a charged
particle moving on a two-dimensional plane in the presence of a uniform magnetic eld

perpendicular to the plane. thus the energy level of the hamiltonian h is identical to
the landau level, 4c(n + 1

2) (n = 0, 1,  ).

now we can nd that the tachyon develops when m2 and m2 approach to some critical

interval, by diagonalizing the mass matrices for (8, 9)-directions:

um 2

(8,9)u =   b2 + 2c(2n + 3)

0

0

b2 + 2c(2n  1) ! ,

u =

1

2   i i

1 ! .

1

(15)

the upper eigenvalue is the mass square of the matrix   12
(9 + i8), and the lower
is that of   12(9  i8). the mass square of  becomes negative for the ground state
when the interval b is shorter than 2c, and thus the ground state of  corresponds to a
complex tachyon mode in the d2-d2 pair for b < 2c [15, 16].

we can easily carry out the one-loop calculation, and the long range potential between

m2 and m2 are reliably calculated in this approximation. the result is

and the agreement with the supergravity result was found at least up to a numerical
factor [15, 16]. speaking repeatedly, the potential (16) diverges for b < 2c, and it
exhibits the tachyon instability of this system. a lesson from the one-loop computation is

that the tachyon mode appears in the uctuation  when the distance between m2 and
m2 becomes shorter than the critical value 2c.

we are now interested in the region b  2c. at the critical distance b = 2c, a
massless mode comes out and it might be related to the horizon of a black hole [18]. we
will mention this point later. for the region b < 2c, a complex tachyon develops and
thus it would annihilate the m2-m2 pair by its condensation. moreover, as mentioned

before, the gravitons are supposed to be produced in this process as vortex solutions on

the membrane worldvolume. let us discuss this mechanism in the case of the coincident

m2-m2 pair, that is, b = 0 case. for this purpose, it is enough to consider only the
matrices x 8 and x 9, and to set the others to zero. the action in our concern is

s(8,9) =

1

p z dt

r3m 6

tr[x 8, x 9]2.

the matrices x 8 and x 9 take the form

(17)

where axi and ayi denote the diagonal uctuations. it is straightforward to show that the
action (17) can be written, after setting  = 0 (dened below the eq. (15)), as

which saturate the bogomolnyi bound [20]. there is, however, subtlety at this point.6 in
our convention the rst equation usually describes one of the bogomolnyi equations for

vortices, while the second one is that for anti-vortices [21]. thus it seems that we cannot

5as pointed out in [10, 11], even the decoupled u (1) here should be eliminated in the m 2-m 2 anni-
hilation. the author of [19] proposed a resolution of this puzzle. we, however, do not understand how it
can be applied to our case.

have vortex solutions on r2. but remember that our membranes have topology of 2-torus
[13], and in fact we can show the existence of vortex solutions on t 2.

let us express the higgs eld  by two real valued functions u and  as  = exp[ 1

i)]. from the rst equation in (28) the gauge eld az = 1
az = i

2z(u + i), where z = 1

conjugation and  is a multivalued function.7 then the second equation in (28) deduces
to

zzu = c  eu + 2

2(z  zk).

(29)

now we devide the radial part u of the higgs eld into a singular part u0 and an analytic
part v. the singular function u0 takes the form

(30)

(31)

and this is exactly doubly periodic [22]. the analytic function v obeys the equation

by the theorem 7.2 of kazdan and warner [23], one can show the existence of a solution
for this equation, at least if c + n

given by fxy = n

is suciently small. now the magnetic eld fxy is

22  2zzv, and thus the magnetic ux is

zt 2

dzdzfxy = 2n.

(32)

this corresponds to the n-vortex solution on t 2, in which each vortex is sitting at one of
the zeros zk of the higgs eld [24].

the bound for the energy is exactly zero, as opposed to the ordinary abelian higgs

model in which the bound is the absolute value of the magnetic ux. this indicates that

vortices in this system are massless particle, and thus they can be regarded as gravitons

in m-theory.

it, however, seems somewhat strange that a massless particle does not

carry any energy. but remember that the matrix theory hamiltonian is of the form
+ m 2)/2p. hence in matrix theory the hamiltonian of a massless particle
h = (p2

without transverse momentum is exactly zero, which accords with the above result. we

would like to note that anti-gravitons cannot appear in this system, again in accordance

with the interpretaion of matrix theory [13], since as we have shown the magnetic ux is

7on r2,  may be chosen as 2pn

k=1 arg(z  zk).

positive, which couples to a rr one-form via a chern-simons coupling and thus gives a

d0-brane charge in the corresponding type iia picture. a graviton of this type carries the

m-momemtum as a magnetic ux r dxdyfxy, which may be reminiscent of the membrane

scattering with m-momentum transfer [25][26]. a vortex solution is, however, a static

solution, as is dierent from an instanton solution which can provide scattering processes

with m-momentum transfer. hence a vortex solution cannot describe a tranfer of m-

momentum.

we would also like to remark that, at the minimum of the tachyon potential, the sum of

the tension of m2 and m2 is exactly cancelled by the energy density of the tachyon eld,
as discussed in [5, 6]. we can observe it from the action (26): (here in unit r3m 6

p = 1)

  4z dxdy c2.

2

c2 = 4z dxdy c2, (33)

(34)

this indicates the restoration of supersymmetry [5]. now let us discuss the supersymmetry

of this system. the initial state, the m2-m2 pair, breaks all of the supersymmetry. as we

showed above, it is annihilated via the tachyon condensation and a graviton is produced

as a vortex solution on the membrane worldvolume. the nal state, a graviton, is a

massless state, and thus it must preserve a half of the supersymmetry. let us look at the

fermion transformation law under the supersymmetry transformations:

 = (cid:18)dtx ii 

i
2

[x i, x j]ij(cid:19)  + .

(35)

for a vortex solution we can nd that

i[ 1

 89 + 

(36)

this shows that a vortex solution indeed preserves a half of the supersymmetry, as we

expected. note also that gravitons in matrix theory are described by a background of
commuting matrices. the above result (36) is nothing but the statement that x 8 and
x 9 are commuting for a vortex solution. again this agrees with the interpretation of a
vortex as a graviton in matrix theory.

now we would like to remark future directions of this work. the authors in [18]

pointed out the similarity of the tachyon instability to the absorption of matters by a

non-extremal black hole. they argued that this similarity leads to the identication of

the horizon of a non-extremal black hole with a critcal point (corresponding to a point

7

b = 2c in the m2-m2 system) where a massless mode comes out. as the horizon has a
light-cone structure, the appearance of a massless mode matches this feature. along the

line of their arguments, it would be interesting to pursue the following possibility in the

m2-m2 system. we will indicate the corresponding picture in terms of a black hole in

parenthesis:

set m2 and m2 innitely separated, that is, b(t = ) = . the attractive force
between m2 and m2 makes them approach up to a crtical point (the horizon), b(t) = 2c,
where a massless mode appears, and subsequently they across this point (the horizon)

to exhibit the tachyon instability. then there appears a vortex (the formation of a non-

extremal black hole) which is time-dependent through b(t) and does not saturate the
bogomolnyi bound for the region, 0 < b(t) < 2c. we expect that m2 and m2 gradually
collapses to a point, b(t = ) = 0, where a vortex (a remnant of a black hole, in this
case a graviton) saturates the bogomolnyi bound as discussed above. in this senario the

initial energy of m2 and m2 seems to disappear, for a vortex at the nal state does not

carry any light-cone energy as mentioned before. but matrix theory is unitary and thus

the total energy of m2 and m2 must be radiated (the hawking radiation) by a certain

mechanism.

another direction is to study stable non-bps states [4, 6, 7, 8, 9] in matrix theory. to

do this, we need certain orbifold or orientifold projections to make a complex tachyon real

so that there can exist a kink solution on the brane  anti-brane pair. as an example it

is straightforward to apply our analysis to a matrix theory on an orientifold background

[27]. we will report some progress in this direction elsewhere [28]. it also seems possible

to discuss stable non-bps states in type i theory [6, 7] by making use of the usp(2k)

matrix model [29].

finally we would like to mention that our analysis is applicable to more general sys-

tems, such as general brane  anti-brane pairs in the iib matrix model [30] as well as

those in matrix theory.
