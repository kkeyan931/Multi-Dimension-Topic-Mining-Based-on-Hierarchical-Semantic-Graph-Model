abstract

the relation between some perturbative non-bps states of the heterotic theory on
t 4 and non-perturbative non-bps states of the orbifold limit of type iia on k3 is
exhibited. the relevant states include a non-bps d-string, and a non-bps bound state
of bps d-particles (d-molecule). the domains of stability of these states in the two
theories are determined and compared.

1 introduction

it has become apparent recently that the duality symmetries of string theory give rise to
predictions about states that are not necessarily bps [1]. in particular, it was demonstrated
by sen in [2, 3] that perturbative non-bps states of one theory, that are stable due to the fact
that they are the lightest states carrying a given set of charges, can sometimes be identied
in the dual theory as bound states of bps d-strings and anti-d-strings. alternatively, these
states could be described as novel non-bps d-particles [4, 5] that are easily constructed using
the boundary state approach [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. these, and perhaps other non-bps d-branes
can also be naturally understood in terms of k-theory [12], where dierent states that can
decay into one another lie in the same equivalence class.

so far only two cases have been studied in detail. in one of them, the perturbative non-
bps state in question is a massive state in the ten-dimensional so(32) heterotic string that
transforms in the spinor representation of so(32). the dual type i state is then a zz2-valued
non-bps d-particle [5, 12]. the other case involves the orientifold theory iib/i4, where i4
is the inversion of four spatial directions. the relevant perturbative non-bps state in this
case is the ground state of the string beginning on a d5-brane and ending on its image, and
the dual state is a non-bps d-particle in the orbifold of type iib by (1)fli4 [4].
if we compactify the latter theory on a 4-torus, the orbifold is related by t-duality to type
iia on t 4/i4, which in turn is the orbifold limit of a k3 surface. on the other hand, iia on
k3 is also related non-perturbatively to the heterotic string on t 4, and it should therefore be
possible to identify suitable perturbative non-bps states of the heterotic string on t 4 with
brane states in iia on k3. this is all the more interesting since the (bps) spectrum of the
heterotic string is very well understood, and therefore detailed comparisons can be made.

in this paper we analyse two classes of perturbative non-bps states in the heterotic
theory on t 4, and relate them to non-bps states in the t 4/i4 orbifold of iia. the relevant
states are a non-bps d-string (that is t-dual to the non-bps d-particle of the iib orbifold
theory), and a non-bps d-molecule. both can be understood as non-bps bound states of
bps d-branes; in the rst case tachyon condensation takes place, whereas in the second the
bound state is due to an ordinary attractive force. in each case, we also analyse the stability
of these non-bps states as a function of the moduli of the theory. since their masses are not
protected against quantum corrections however, this analysis only holds at weak coupling
in either theory, and therefore we do not expect the masses and regions of stability to be
related by the duality. nevertheless, we nd non-vanishing regions of stability for both types
of states in both the heterotic string and the type iia string descriptions. furthermore, for
the non-bps d-string these regions are closely related by the duality transformation.

the orbifold limit of k3 is a rather special point in the moduli space of the theory, and it
is therefore interesting to understand how the various states can be understood for a smooth
k3. to this end we also discuss how the non-bps states can be understood in terms of

2

wrapped membranes.

the paper is organised as follows:

in section 2 the duality map between the heterotic
string on t 4 and type iia at the orbifold point of k3 is established. this is then tested by
comparing the masses of certain bps states of the two theories in section 3. in section 4 the
non-bps states are analysed in both theories. we conclude and raise some open problems in
section 5.

while this paper was being prepared we obtained the preprint [13] in which the non-
bps d-string of the type iia orbifold, as well as its stability and interpretation in terms of
wrapped membranes, is also discussed.

2 heterotic  iia duality in the orbifold limit

let us recall the precise relation between type iia at the orbifold point of k3 and the heterotic
string on t 4; the following discussion follows closely [14]. denote the compact coordinates
by xi, where i = 1, 2, 3, 4, and the corresponding radii in the heterotic string theory by rhi.
the sequence of dualities relating the two theories is given by

het t 4

s i t 4 t 4
where the various zz2 groups are

t iia t 4/zz2 ,

zz
2 = (1, i4) zz

2 = (1, (1)fli4) zz2 = (1,i4) .

(2.1)

(2.2)

here i4 reects all four compact directions,  reverses world-sheet parity, and fl is the left-
moving part of the spacetime fermion number. the rst step is ten-dimensional s-duality
between the (so(32)) heterotic string and the type i string [15], which relates the (ten-
dimensional) couplings and radii as1

gi  g1

h

rij  g1/2

h rhj .

(2.3)

the second step consists of four t-duality transformations on the four circles, resulting in
the new parameters

g  = v 1
j = r1

i gi  v 1
h gh

(2.4)

where vi = qj rij and vh = qj rhj denote the volumes (divided by (2)4) of the t 4 in

the type i and heterotic strings, respectively. this theory has 16 orientifold xed points.

1numerical factors are omitted until the last step.

3

in order for the dilaton to be a constant, the rr charges have to be cancelled locally, i.e.
one pair of d5-branes has to be situated at each orientifold 5-plane. in terms of the original
heterotic theory, this means that suitable wilson lines must be switched on to break so(32)
(or e8  e8) to u(1)16; this will be further discussed below. the third step is s-duality of
type iib. the new parameters are given by

g  = g 1
r

j = g 1/2r

 vhg1
j  v 1/2

h

h r1
hj .

(2.5)

finally, the fourth step is t-duality along one of the compact directions, say x4. the resulting
theory is type iia on a k3 in the orbifold limit. the coupling constants and radii are given
by

ga = g (r
raj = r

where we have now included the numerical factors (that will be shown below to reproduce
the correct masses for the bps-states).2 in addition, the metrics in the low energy eective
theories are related as [16]

ga

h gh

 .

(2.7)

the appropriate wilson lines in the heterotic theory on t 4 can be determined in analogy
with the duality between the heterotic string on s1 and type iia on s1/i1 (type ia). a
constant dilaton background for the latter requires the wilson line a = (( 1
2)8, 08) in the
former [17, 18, 19], resulting in the gauge group so(16)  so(16). the sixteen entries in
the wilson line describe the positions of the d8-branes along the interval in type ia. this
suggests that the four wilson lines in our case should be

so that there is precisely one pair of d-branes at each of the sixteen orientifold planes. indeed,
this conguration of wilson lines breaks the gauge group so(32) to so(2)16  u(1)16, and

2in our conventions 

h = 1/2, 

a = 1.

4

there are no other massless gauge particles that are charged under the cartan subalgebra of
so(32). to see this, recall that the momenta of the compactied heterotic string are given
as [20]

pl = (pl, pl) =  vk + ai

kwi ,

pi

+ wiri!

pr =

pr =   pi

where pi is the physical momentum in the compact directions

pi = ni + bijwj  v kai

(2.9)

(2.10)

wi, ni  zz are elements of the compactication lattice 4,4, and v k is an element of the
internal lattice 16. for a given momentum (pl, pr), a physical state can exist provided the
level matching condition

p2
l + nl  1 =

p2
r + nr  cr

(2.11)

is satised, where nl and nr are the left- and right-moving excitation numbers, and cr = 1/2
(cr = 0) for the right-moving ns (r) sector. the state is bps if nr = cr [21], and its mass
is given by

l + nl  1(cid:19) +(cid:18)1

p2

r + nr  cr(cid:19) = p2

r + 2(nr  cr) .

(2.12)

the massless states of the gravity multiplet and the cartan subalgebra have nl = 1 and
pl = pr = 0. additional massless gauge bosons would have to have nl = 0, and therefore
p2
l = 2. if wi = 0 for all i, this requires v 2 = 2 and pi = 0. the possible choices for v
are then simply the roots of so(32), and it is easy to see that for each root at least one of
k is half-integer; thus pi  zz + 1/2 cannot vanish, and the state is
the inner products v kai
massive. on the other hand, if wi 6= 0 for at least one i, the above requires (v + aw)2 < 2,
and it follows that v + aw = 0, i.e. that the massless gauge particle is not charged under
the cartan subalgebra of so(32).

3 bps states

in order to test the above identication further, it is useful to relate some of the perturbative
bps states of the heterotic string to d-brane states in iia on t 4/zz2, and to compare their
masses. let us start with the simplest case  a bulk d-particle. this state is charged only

5

under the bulk u(1) corresponding to the ten-dimensional rr one-form c (1)
rr.
described by the boundary state in iia

it can be

|d0; 1 >=

1

2(cid:16)|u0 >n sn s +1|u0 >rr (cid:17) ,

(3.1)

where the two components are dened in the standard way [10], and lie in the untwisted
nsns and rr sectors, respectively. here 1 = 1 dierentiates a d-particle from an anti-
d-particle. for a suitable normalisation of the two components the open-closed consistency
condition is satised [22, 10], and the spectrum of open strings beginning on one d-particle
and ending on another is given by

[ns  r]

1

2(cid:16)1 + 1

1(1)f(cid:17) .

(3.2)

the corresponding state in the heterotic string has trivial winding (wi = 0) and momentum
(v = 0, pi = 0), except for p4 = 1. level matching then requires that nl = 1, and therefore
the state is really a kaluza-klein excitation of either the gravity multiplet or one of the vector
multiplets in the cartan subalgebra. its mass is given by (2.12)

mh(d0) =

1
rh4

.

(3.3)

the corresponding mass in type iia can be found using (2.6) and (2.7), and turns out to be

ma(d0) = v 1/2

h

ghmh(d0) =

1
ga

.

(3.4)

this is in complete agreement with the mass of a d-particle.

next consider a d-particle which is stuck at one of the xed planes. both its mass
and bulk rr charge are half of those of the bulk d-particle (since prior to the projection
it corresponds to a single d-particle, whereas the bulk d-particle corresponds to two d-
particles); it is therefore called a fractional d-particle [23]. it also carries unit charge with
respect to the twisted rr u(1) at the xed plane. the corresponding boundary state is of
the form

|d0f ; 1, 2 >=

1

2(cid:20)(cid:16)|u0 >n sn s +1|u0 >rr (cid:17) + 2(cid:16)|t 0 >n sn s +1|t 0 >rr (cid:17)(cid:21) ,

(3.5)

where |u0 >n sn s and |u0 >rr are the same states that appeared in (3.1), and |t 0 >n sn s
and |t 0 >rr lie in the twisted nsns and twisted rr sectors, respectively. here 1 = 1 and
12 = 1 determine the sign of the bulk and the twisted charges of the state, respectively.
using standard techniques [10, 2, 4] it is easy to see that each of the components is invariant

6

under the gso and orbifold projections, and that for a suitable normalisation of the twisted
components the open-closed consistency condition is again satised. indeed, the spectrum of
open strings beginning on one fractional d-particle and ending on another is given by

[ns  r]

1

4(cid:16)1 + 1

1(1)f(cid:17)(cid:16)1 + 2

2i4(cid:17) .

(3.6)

in the blow up of the orbifold to a smooth k3, the fractional d-particle corresponds to a
d2-brane which wraps a supersymmetric cycle [24].
in the orbifold limit the area of this
cycle vanishes, but the corresponding state is not massless, since the two-form eld b(2) has
a non-vanishing integral around the cycle [25].
in fact b = 1/2, and the resulting state
carries one unit of twisted charge coming from the membrane itself, and one half unit of bulk
charge coming from the d2-brane world-volume action term r d3 c (1)
rr  (f (2) + b(2)). at
each xed point there are four such states, corresponding to the two possible orientations
of the membrane, and the possibility of having f = 0 or f = 1 (as f must be integral,
the state always has a non-vanishing bulk charge). these are the four possible fractional
d-particles of (3.5). since there are sixteen orbifold xed planes, there are a total of 64 such
states.

in the heterotic string these correspond to states with internal weight vectors of the form

v = (02n, 1,1, 0142n)

(n = 1, . . . , 8) ,

(3.7)

and vanishing winding and internal momentum, except for p4 = 1/2. the sixteen twisted
u(1) charges in the iia picture correspond to symmetric and anti-symmetric combinations
of the (2n + 1)st and (2n + 2)nd cartan u(1) charges in the heterotic picture. it follows
from the heterotic mass formula (2.12) that the mass of these states is

mh(d0f ) =

1

2rh4

.

as before, this corresponds to the mass

ma(d0f ) = v 1/2

h

gh mh(d0f ) =

1
2ga

,

(3.8)

(3.9)

in the orbifold of type iia, and is thus in complete agreement with the mass of a fractional
d-particle.

additional bps states are obtained by wrapping d2-branes around non-vanishing su-
persymmetric 2-cycles, and by wrapping d4-branes around the entire compact space. one
can compute the mass of each of these states, and thus nd the corresponding state in the
heterotic string. let us briey summarise the results:

7

(i) a d2-brane that wraps the cycle (xi, xj) where i 6= j and i, j  {1, 2, 3} has mass ma =
rairaj/(2ga); in heterotic units this corresponds to mh = 2rhk, where k  {1, 2, 3}
is not equal to either i or j. the corresponding heterotic state has wk = 1, pl = 0,
(v  ak)2 = 2, and nl = 0.

(ii) a d2-brane that wraps the cycle (xi, x4), where i is either 1, 2 or 3, has mass ma =
raira4/(2ga); in heterotic units this corresponds to mh = 1/(2rhi). the corresponding
heterotic state therefore has pi = 1/2, wj = 0, v 2 = 2, and nl = 0.

(iii) a d4-brane wrapping the entire compact space has mass ma = qi rai/(2ga); in het-

erotic units this corresponds to mh = 2rh4. the corresponding heterotic state therefore
has w4 = 1, pl = 0, (v  a4)2 = 2, and nl = 0.

4 non-bps states

the heterotic string also contains non-bps states that are stable in certain domains of the
moduli space. one should therefore expect that these states can also be seen in the dual
type iia theory, and that they correspond to non-bps branes. of course, since non-bps
states are not protected by supersymmetry against quantum corrections to their mass, the
analysis below will only hold for gh  1 and ga  1 in the heterotic and type iia theory,
respectively.

4.1 non-bps d-string

the simplest examples of this kind are the heterotic states with vanishing winding and
momenta (wi = pi = 0), and weight vectors given by

v = (0m,2, 015m)
v  = (02m,1,1, 02n,1,1, 0122n2m) .

(4.1)

the results of the previous section indicate that these states are charged under precisely two
u(1)s associated with two xed points in iia, and are uncharged with respect to any of
the other u(1)s. there are four states for each pair of u(1)s, carrying 1 charges with
respect to the two u(1)s. in all cases v 2 = 4, and we must choose nr = cr + 1 to satisfy
level-matching. these states are therefore not bps, and transform in long multiplets of the
d = 6 n = (1, 1) supersymmetry algebra. their mass is given by

mh = 22 ,

(4.2)

as follows from (2.12); in particular, the mass is independent of the radii.

8

on the other hand, these states carry the same charges as two bps states of the form
discussed in the previous section (where the charge with respect to the spacetime u(1)s is
chosen to be opposite for the two states), and they might therefore decay into them. whether
or not the decay occurs depends on the values of the radii, since the masses of the bps states
depend on them. in particular, the rst state in (4.1) carries the same charges as the two
bps states with p4 = 1/2, and weight vectors of the form
v1 = (02n, 1, 1, 0142n)
v2 = (02n, 1,1, 0142n) ,

(4.3)

where n = [m/2]. the mass of each of these states is 1/(2rh4), and the decay is therefore
energetically forbidden when

rh4 <

.

(4.4)

1
22

more generally, the above non-bps state has the same charges as two bps states with wi = 0,
and internal weight vectors

v1 = (cid:16)0m, 1, 0k, 1, 014mk(cid:17)
v2 = (cid:16)0m, 1, 0k,1, 014mk(cid:17) ,

(4.5)

where again the non-vanishing internal momenta are chosen to be opposite for the two states.
the lightest states of this form have a single non-vanishing momentum, pi = 1/2 for one of
i = 1, 2, 3, 4, and their mass is 1/(2rhi). provided that

rhi <

1
22

i = 1, 2, 3, 4 ,

(4.6)

the non-bps state cannot decay into any of these pairs of bps states, and it should therefore
be stable. similar statements also hold for the non-bps states of the second kind in (4.1).

we should therefore expect that the iia theory possesses a non-bps d-brane that has
the appropriate charges and multiplicities. this state is easily constructed: it is the non-bps
d-string of type iia, whose boundary state is given as

|d1nonbps; ,  >=

1

2(cid:20)|u1;  >n sn s +



2 (cid:16)|t 1; 1 >rr +ei|t 2; 2 >rr(cid:17)(cid:21) ,

(4.7)

where we have used the notation of sen [2].3 here  is the value of the wilson line on the
d-string, which must be 0 or  in the orbifold, and  = 1. the two states in the twisted
rr sector are localised at either end of the d-string (so that the d-string stretches between

two orbifold points). using the standard techniques [10, 2], one can easily check that each
of the boundary components is invariant under the gso and orbifold projections, and, for
a suitable normalisation of the dierent components, the open-closed consistency condition
is satised. the spectrum of open strings beginning and ending on the same d-string is
obtained as usual by computing the cylinder amplitude with the above boundary state, and
the result is

4 is the same as i4, except that it acts on x4 as x4  2ra4  x4. for each pair of
where i 
orbifold points there are four d-strings, which are charged only under the two twisted sector
u(1)s associated to the two orbifold points. these charges are of the same magnitude as
those of the fractional d-particles, since the ground state of |t 1 >rr is the same as that of
|t 0 >rr in (3.5). furthermore, it follows from (4.8) that the d-strings have sixteen (rather
than eight) fermionic zero modes, and therefore transform in long multiplets of the d = 6,
n = (1, 1) supersymmetry algebra. these states therefore have exactly the correct properties
to correspond to the above non-bps states of the heterotic theory.
we should not, however, expect that the corresponding masses are related by the duality
map, since for non-bps states the masses are not protected from quantum corrections. let
us consider for example the case where the d-string is suspended between two orbifold points
that are separated along x4 (fig. 1a). its classical mass is given by

ma(d1nonbps) =

ra42ga

.

(4.9)

the numerical factor can be determined by comparing the boundary state of the non-bps
d-string (4.7) to that of a bps d-string between two xed planes in the (t-dual) type iib
orbifold (eq. (3.16) of [2]). the units of the two orbifold theories are simply related by
replacing ga with gb, and since the coecient of the untwisted nsns component is greater
by a factor of 2 for the non-bps d-string, its mass is given by (4.9). in heterotic units,
this mass is  1/vh, and therefore does not agree with (4.2).
the open string ns sector in (4.8) contains a tachyon. however, since the tachyon is
(1)f -odd, and since i4 reverses the sign of the momentum along the d-string, the zero-
momentum component of the tachyon eld on the d-string is projected out. furthermore,
4 acts as x4  x4  2ra4, the half-odd-integer momentum components are also
since i4i 
removed, leaving a lowest mode of unit momentum. as a consequence, the mass of the
tachyon is shifted to

(4.10)
for ra4 < 2 the tachyon is actually massive, and thus attains its vacuum value at the origin.
on the other hand, for ra4 > 2 the tachyon has a non-zero vacuum expectation value, and

10

the lowest momentum mode describes a kink-anti-kink conguration along the d-string, in
which the tachyon eld vanishes at the two endpoints of the d-string, and approaches its
vacuum value in-between. for ra4 > 2 the state is therefore more appropriately described
as a pair of fractional bps d-particles located at either xed point, and carrying opposite
bulk charges (fig. 1b). alternatively, the ground state of the ns sector open string between
the above two fractional bps d-particles has a mass

,

m2 = 

+ (ra4t0)2 = 

(4.11)
and so becomes tachyonic for ra4 < 2, indicating an instability to decay into the non-bps
d-string. the d-string can therefore be thought of as a bound state of two fractional bps d-
particles located at dierent xed planes. this is also conrmed by the fact that the classical
mass of the d-string (4.9) is smaller than that of two fractional d-particles (3.9) when

ra4 < 2 ,

(4.12)

and thus the d-string is stable against decay into two fractional d-particles in this regime.
in terms of the heterotic string, this decay channel corresponds to (4.3). the regimes of
stability of the non-bps state in the two dual theories, (4.4) and (4.12), are qualitatively the
same, given the duality relation (2.6).

the d-string can therefore also be thought of as a bound state of two bps d2-branes. this
decay channel can also be understood from the appearance of a tachyon on the d-string
carrying one unit of winding in the xi direction, when rai < 1/2 [13], or alternatively from
the appearance of a tachyon between the two d2-branes when rai > 1/2.
in terms of
the heterotic string, these decay channels are described by (4.5), and again the domains of
stability are qualitatively the same. there are analogous regimes of stability for d-strings
stretched between any two xed points.

in the blow up of the orbifold to a smooth k3, the non-bps d-strings correspond to
membranes wrapping pairs of shrinking 2-cycles. since such curves do not have holomorphic
representatives, the states are non-bps. for each pair of 2-cycles there are four states, asso-
ciated with the dierent orientations of the membrane; the membrane can wrap both cycles
with the same orientation, or with opposite orientation. in either case the net bulk charge
due to b = 1/2 can be made to vanish by turning on an appropriate world-volume gauge
eld strength (f = 1 in the rst case, and f = 0 in the second). the decay of the non-bps
d-string into a pair of fractional bps d-particles is described in this picture as the decay of
this membrane into two separate membranes, that wrap individually around the two 2-cycles.
the entire discussion above also has a parallel in the t-dual theory, type iib on t 4/zz
2.
the fractional bps d-particles are t-dual to bps d-strings stretched between pairs of orb-
ifold points, and the non-bps d-string we found is t-dual to the non-bps d-particle that
was constructed in [4]. as was demonstrated by sen [2], this state can be obtained as a
bound state of two fractional bps d-strings carrying opposite bulk charges, and appropriate
twisted charges. for suciently large rb, the d-string pair develops a tachyonic mode and
decays into the non-bps d-particle.

4.2 non-bps d-molecule

the heterotic theory also contains states that are charged under a single u(1) associated
with one xed plane in the iia orbifold, but that are uncharged with respect to any other
u(1). the lightest such states have nl = 0 and an internal weight vector of the form

v = (02n, 2,2, 0142n) .

(4.14)

since v 2 = 8, we must choose nr = cr + 3 to satisfy level matching. the state is therefore
non-bps4 and its mass is given by

mh = 26 .

(4.15)

this state may decay into two bps states of the form (3.7), or into two non-bps states of

the form (4.1). the latter possibility is energetically forbidden since 2  22 > 26, and

4the degeneracy of the state is rather large, and it actually contains 60 long supermultiplets.

the former is possible provided that rh4 > 1/(26). in the heterotic theory, this non-bps
state is therefore stable if 5

rh4 <

.

the above suggests that the dual type iia theory contains a bound state of two fractional
d-particles which are located at the same xed plane, and which carry opposite bulk charges.
in the previous subsection we saw that a bound state of two fractional d-particles of opposite
bulk charge that are located on dierent xed planes could be better described as a non-bps
d-string. let us therefore attempt to describe the above state as a non-bps d-particle at a
xed plane. the associated boundary state would then be given by

|d0nonbps; >= c(cid:16)|u0 >n sn s |t 0 >rr (cid:17) ,

where |u0 >n sn s and |t 0 >rr are the same states as in (3.5), and c is a normalisation
factor which will be determined below. the resulting spectrum of open strings beginning
and ending on this d-particle is given by

(4.17)

(4.18)

[ns  r] c2(cid:16)1 + (1)fi4(cid:17) .

in order for this to make sense as the spectrum of an actual open string theory, the nor-
malisation should be c = 1/2. on the other hand, the magnitude of the twisted charge in
(4.17) would then be 2 in units of the twisted charge associated to the fractional bps d-
particles (3.5).6 furthermore, the spectrum of open strings between the non-bps d-particle
and a fractional bps d-particle is the same as above, except that the overall factor is c/2
rather than c2. for this to make sense we need c = 1, rather than c = 1/2. with this
normalisation, the charge (and mass) in (4.17) is then precisely twice the twisted charge of a
fractional bps d-particle, and the state described by (4.17) is not stable. this is consistent
with the fact that the open string spectrum is now doubled, and therefore cannot describe an
open string that begins and ends on a single d-particle. the situation is also dierent from
the case of the non-bps d-string in that the pair of fractional bps d-particles that carry
opposite bulk charges but equal twisted charges does not exhibit a tachyonic instability, as
follows from (3.6).

on the other hand, one should expect that two such fractional d-particles can bind, since

their interaction is of the form

v (r) = 

a
r7 +

b
r3 ,

a, b > 0 ,

where the rst term is the ten-dimensional (bulk) contribution, and the second term is the
six-dimensional (twisted) contribution. unlike the case of two bps d-particles at dierent

5we are only considering possible decay processes into states with trivial winding number.

xed planes, this bound state does not correspond to a new d-brane; it is most appropriately
referred to as a d-molecule. the d-molecule carries two units of twisted charge, but no
bulk charge, and is therefore still restricted to the xed plane. (this is to be contrasted with
the (threshold) bound state of two fractional bps d-particles carrying equal bulk charges
and opposite twisted charges, which corresponds to a bulk bps d-particle). since the above
interaction comes from the one loop open string diagram, it is o(ga). at weak coupling
the mass of the d-molecule is therefore well approximated by the mass of the two fractional
d-particles, i.e. 1/ga.

the decay channels described above for the heterotic string correspond in iia to the
decay of the d-molecule into a pair of fractional bps d-particles or into a pair of non-bps
d-strings. here it is the former which is energetically forbidden. on the other hand, the mass
of two non-bps d-strings is 2rai/ga, and is therefore smaller than that of the d-molecule
if rai < 1/2. the d-molecule is thus stable in the type iia theory when rai > 1/2.

unlike the non-bps d-string, the stability domains of the d-molecule are qualitatively
dierent in the two theories, i.e. at weak and strong iia coupling. at weak iia coupling only
the decay into non-bps states is possible, whereas at strong iia coupling, only the decay
into bps states is allowed. as the coupling is varied from weak to strong, the energy levels
must therefore cross over, and we expect that at intermediate coupling, both decay channels
will be available.

in the blow up to a smooth k3 the d-molecule corresponds to two d2-branes wrapping a
shrinking 2-cycle. the world-volume gauge eld must be f = 1 on one of the membranes,
to cancel the bulk charge due to b = 1/2 on the 2-cycle. the (conditional) stability of this
particle implies that the two wrapped d2-branes should form a (non-threshold) bound state
in a non-vanishing region of moduli space.

4.3 other non-bps states

there exist also other non-bps states in the heterotic string that are stable in certain regions
of the moduli space, such as states transforming in the spinor representation of so(32), e.g.
v = ((1/2)16). in d = 10 this state has been identied with a zz2-valued non-bps d-particle
in the dual type i string [3, 5, 12]. going through the sequence of duality transformations
in (2.1) suggests the following interpretation for this state: after the four t-dualities the d-
particle becomes a non-bps d4-brane in iib on t 4/zz
2. under s-duality this transforms into
a non-bps (non-dirichlet) 4-brane. the nal t-duality then gives a non-bps 4-brane in iia
on t 4/zz2. like the type i d-particle, this 4-brane is zz2-valued. perhaps this 4-brane can
be understood as a bound state of an ns-5-brane and an anti-ns-5-brane, in analogy with
the d-brane case. however, it is not yet clear what the analogue of the tachyon condensation
would be.

5 conclusions

in this paper we have analysed the duality between the heterotic string on t 4 and the type
iia string on k3 for states that are not necessarily bps. in particular, type iia string theory
on t 4/zz2, which is the orbifold limit of k3, admits a non-bps d-string as well as a non-
bps d-molecule, which are related by the duality map to perturbative non-bps states in
the heterotic string, and therefore probe the duality beyond the regime of bps states. the
d-string is also related by t-duality to the non-bps d-particle of the related orbifold of type
iib string theory, which was constructed in [4].

these states are not stable everywhere in moduli space. we have determined their regions
of stability in both the heterotic and type iia pictures, and we have found these regions to
be of non-vanishing size in both cases. for the case of the non-bps d-string, the regions
of stability are also qualitatively related by the duality map. since the masses of non-bps
states are not protected by supersymmetry, this was not guaranteed a priori.

it would be interesting to understand these branes in terms of the k-theoretic framework
proposed by witten [12]. more generally, it would be interesting to analyse systematically
the various non-bps dirichlet-branes in orbifolds and orientifolds of type ii theories, and
relate them to the k-theory predictions.
