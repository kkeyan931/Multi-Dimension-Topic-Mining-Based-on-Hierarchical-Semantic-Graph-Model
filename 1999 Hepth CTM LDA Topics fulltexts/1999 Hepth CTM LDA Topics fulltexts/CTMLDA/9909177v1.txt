abstract

we consider the general hypermultiplet low-energy eective actions (leea) that may
appear in four-dimensional, n=2 supersymmetric yang-mills theories, e.g.
in the
coulomb and higgs branches. our main purpose is a description of the exact leea
of n magnetically charged hypermultiplets. the hypermultiplet leea is given by the
n=2 supersymmetric non-linear sigma-model (nlsm) with a 4n-dimensional hyper-
kahler metric of the multi-monopole moduli space. harmonic superspace (hss)
and nlsm isometries are used to x the hyper-kahler potential of the metric in
question. the n=2 supersymmetric duality relations between hss superelds and
n=2 linear (tensor) o(2) and o(4) multiplets in n=2 projective superspace (pss) are
used to deduce the explicit form of the multi-monopole moduli space metric in some
particular cases. as the by-product, a simple new classication of all (uncentered)
multi-monopole moduli space metrics is obtained in terms of real quartic polynomials
of 2n variables, modulo sp(n) transformations. the hypermultiplet leea in pss
can be nicely encoded in terms of an elliptic curve.

1 introduction

the seminal work of seiberg and witten [1] gave several important insights into
the non-perturbative dynamics of the four-dimensional n=2 supersymmetric su(2)
yang-mills theory whose gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken to its abelian sub-
group (in the so-called coulomb branch). it was subsequently generalized to other
simply-laced gauge groups and n=2 super-qcd as well [2] (see also ref. [3] for a review
or an introduction). the seiberg-witten theory deals with the exact low-energy ef-
fective action (leea) in terms of abelian n=2 vector multiplets, which includes both
perturbative (one-loop) and non-perturbative (instanton) corrections. n=2 extended
supersymmetry plays the very important role in this construction, by restricting the
form of the n=2 vector leea to the most general ansatz governed by a single holo-
morphic function f (w a) of the n=2 abelian vector supereld strengths w a, where
a = 1, 2, . . . , nc  1 [4]. this ansatz is manifestly n=2 supersymmetric and model-
independent due to the o-shell nature of the n=2 restricted chiral superelds w a.
according to the riemann-hilbert theorem, a (milti-valued) holomorphic function is
fully determined by its singularity structure and monodromy (or asymptotics). the
number of singularities is dictated by witten index [5]. however, a calculation of the
witten index in massless gauge theories is plagued with ambiguities, so that its value
is usually postulated from physical considerations and consistency, which is closely
related to the existence of bps monopoles representing the non-perturbative degrees
of freedom in the non-abelian n=2 gauge theory under consideration [3]. indeed, any
non-abelian n=2 supersymmetric gauge eld theory can be considered as a particular
yang-mills-higgs system (with extra fermions) whose eld equations admit solitonic
solutions labelled by magnetic charge, and whose scalar potential is xed by n=2 su-
persymmetry. the monodromy behaviour is obtained from perturbative calculations
and electric-magnetic (s) duality. for example, the chiral anomaly of the underlying
n=2 gauge theory fully determines the perturbative (logarithmic) contribution to the
second derivative of f (w ), which is equivalent to knowing the monodromy around
innity in the quantum moduli space parametrized by vacuum expectation values of
the higgs elds. the s duality and global consistency conditions x the remaining
monodromies and, hence, the whole function f (w ).

due to the holomorphicity of the seiberg-witten leea, the non-perturbative
contributions to f (w ) take the form of an innite sum over all instanton numbers.
in particular, no instanton/anti-instanton (i.e. non-holomorphic) contributions can
appear in the seiberg-witten leea, in contrast to the standard (n=0) qcd. yet
another special and very remarkable feature of the seiberg-witten-type solutions is

2

the fact that any of them (e.g., in the su(nc)-based theory) can be nicely encoded
in terms of the auxiliary (hyperelliptic) curve (or riemann surface) sw of genus
(nc  1) [1, 2]. the function f (w ) is most naturally represented in the parametric
form, in terms of certain abelian dierential sw (of the 3rd kind) to be integrated
over the periods of sw [3].

n=2 supersymmetric gauge eld theories can have only two types of rigid n=2
supermultiplets, an n=2 vector multiplet comprising the helicities (1, 1
2, 0), and a
hypermultiplet comprising the helicities ( 1
2 ,0). the two types of n=2 multiplets
are truly dierent in four spacetime dimensions (4d), but they become dual to each
other in three dimensions (3d). the latter observation can be elevated to the co-called
c-map relating the special kahler geometry of the vector multiplet moduli space to
the hyper-kahler geometry of the hypermultiplet moduli space [6] or, even further, to
the mirror symmetry between certain type-ii superstring compactications on calabi-
yau manifolds [7]. the leea of the 3d, n=4 supersymmetric non-abelian gauge eld
theories can, therefore, be deduced along the lines of the seiberg-witten theory [8].
one of the most remarkable developments in the 3d seiberg-witten theory was the
proposed equivalence between the quantum moduli space of the 3d, n=4 supersym-
metric su(n) gauge theory (in the coulomb branch) and the classical (centered)
moduli space of n bps monopoles in the 4d, su(2) yang-mills-higgs system [9, 10].
in particular, as was argued by hanany and witten [10], this equivalence between
the moduli spaces of dierent eld theories in dierent dimensions, for all n, can be
understood as a consequence of s-duality applied to certain congurations of inter-
secting (dirichlet) 3-branes and 5-branes in type-ii superstring theory. though the
brane technology appears to be very ecient in explaining the equivalence between
the moduli spaces, it is still not powerful enough in deriving a metric on this mod-
uli space. the quantum moduli space of the 3d, n=4 supersymmetric su(2) gauge
theory can be rigorously established [11], while it is described by the two-monopole
atiyah-hitchin metric [12], whereas for n > 2 the relevant metric is essentially un-
known. the asymptotic form of the metric in the classical multi-monopole moduli
space is available [13, 14].

a derivation of the exact hypermultiplet leea in four dimensions (4d) requires
the techniques that are very dierent from the ones used in the seiberg-witten theory.
the main reason for this is the dierent status enjoyed by a scalar multiplet (hyper-
multiplet) versus a vector multiplet in 4d, n=2 supersymmetry. to appreciate this
fact, it is worth mentioning that there exists no o-shell, manifestly n=2 supersym-
metric (i.e. model-independent) formulation of the most fundamental fayet-sohnius
(fs) hypermultiplet in the conventional n=2 extended superspace in 4d (see, e.g.,

3

ref. [15] for a review). some o-shell versions of n=2 hypermutiplet exist in n=2
projective superspace (pss) [16], where they are known as the projective or (gener-
alised) tensor n=2 mutliplets [17, 18], at the expense of breaking the su(2)r internal
symmetry rotating n=2 supersymmetry charges. the most symmetric approach to
n=2 supersymmetry is provided by harmonic superspace (hss) [19], at the expense
of introducing the innite number of auxiliary elds. unlike the pss approach, both
n=2 vector multiplets and hypermultiplets can be introduced in hss on equal footing,
while hss allows one to keep both n=2 supersymmetry and its automorphism sym-
metry su(2)r manifest. in the pss approach, one adds a holomorphic (projective)
coordinate to the conventional n=2 superspace, and one uses hidden holomorphicity
of the n=2 superspace constraints dening the n=2 generalized tensor (or projec-
tive) multiplets.
in the hss description, one adds group-valued twistors and uses
hidden the grassmann analyticity of the o-shell hss constraints dening n=2 vec-
tor multiplets and hypermultiplets.
in our view, as far as n=2 supersymmetry in
4d is concerned, grassmann analyticity is more fundamental than holomorphicity.
at the same time, both pss and hss descriptions of the hypermultiplet leea are
closely related, most notably, in the form of n=2 duality relations between the hss
and pss multiplets.

the group of analyticity-preserving eld reparametrizations (e.g. in hss) is much
larger than the group of holomorphicity-preserving reparametrizations (e.g. in pss).
accordingly, a derivation of the exact hypermultiplet leea is more complicated
or, at least, dierent, from solving a seiberg-witten (or riemann-hilbert) problem,
just because more data is needed to x a (grassmann) analytic function versus a
holomorphic one. a formal solution to the riemann-hilbert problem is given by the
linear system of picard-fuchs dierential equations [20]. as is demonstrated in this
paper, a formal solution to the hypermultiplet leea and the multi-monopole moduli
space metric can be given in hss, in the form of an analytic hyper-kahler potential
of the metric. a derivation of the metric from the hyper-kahler potential requires the
elimination of all the auxiliary elds hidden in analytic hypermultiplet superelds,
which amounts to solving the (innite) linear system of dierential equations on a
two-sphere.

from the physical point of view, it is important to understand the origin of a non-
trivial hypermultiplet self-interaction in the leea. for example, as was argued by
seiberg and witten [1], the exact eective nlsm metric for fundamental hypermul-
tiplets with vanishing magnetic charges in the higgs branch of a 4d, n=2 gauge eld
theory is at, i.e. there is no self-interaction at all. however, magnetically charged
(massive) hypermultiplets can have a non-trivial self-interaction [21, 22]. this obser-

4

vation is consistent with the brane technology [23]. the corresponding leea just
describes the low-energy dynamics of the bps monopoles representing nonperturba-
tive degrees of freedom, in the lorentz-invariant way (cf. ref. [24]). for instance,
the non-trivial nlsm corrections to the perturbative hypermultilet leea found in
refs. [21, 22] (see sect. 3 too) are all proportional to the squared absolute value of
a central charge in n=2 supersymmetry algebra. the central charge itself is given
by a linear combination of abelian charges of the underlying (spontaneously broken)
non-abelian n=2 gauge theory. the non-vanishing central charge is also responsi-
ble for a dynamical generation of the non-trivial scalar potential associated with the
hypermultiplet leea [22, 25]. these important features were missed in the earlier
investigations of n=2 supersymmetric eld theories, which were either limited to
renormalizable n=2 eld theories or didnt include n=2 central charges.

the paper is organized as follows. in sect. 2 we review a superspace derivation of
the known relation between n=2 supersymmetry and hyper-kahler geometry in 4d
nlsm, which plays the central role in our investigation. we remind the reader about
the formulation of n=2 nlsm in n=1 superspace and then motivate the use of n=2
pss and n=2 hss for a resolution of the hyper-kahler constraints and isometries.
in sect. 3 we discuss in detail the most general 4d leea of a single hypermultiplet,
and demonstrate that it is given by the n=2 nlsm with the taub-nut or atiyah-
hitchin metric. sect. 4 is devoted to our results for many hypermultiplets. general
conclusions are collected in sect. 5. our presentation is self-contained. basic facts
about hyper-kahler geometry are given in appendix a. projective superspace (pss)
is introduced in appendix b. harmonic superspace (hss) is introduced in appendix
c. the classical moduli space of solitonic solutions in the su(2) yang-mills-higgs
system is discussed in appendix d.

2 supersymmetry and hyper-kahler geometry

the most natural description of 4d supersymmetry is provided by superspace. the
natural framework for n=1 supersymmetry is given by n=1 superspace [26]. n=2
extended supersymmetry can be manifestly realized in n=2 superspace which has
three dierent versions (standard, projective and harmonic). as regards n=2 nlsm,
in subsect. 2.1 we rst describe them along the standard lines of n=1 superspace [29],
which makes clear the equivalence between n=2 rigid supersymmetry and hyper-
kahler geometry in 4d nlsm. the n=2 nlsm in terms of n=2 superelds are
discussed in subsect. 2.2. subsect. 2.3 is devoted to isometries in general n=2 nlsm.

the whole section establishes our setup and provides a technical introduction for the
rest of the paper.

2.1 n=2 nlsm in n=1 superspace

n=1 scalar (chiral) multiplets are described by the n=1 complex chiral superelds
i and their conjugates i, i = 1, 2, . . . , k, satisfying the o-shell constraints

). they obey the basic anticommutation relations of n=1





{d, d

,

{d, d} = { d 



, d 

} = 0 .

(2.2)

we use the two-component spinor notation that is standard in 4d supersymmetry
[26]. the eld components of the chiral supereld i are

ai = i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) , i

 = d i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) , f i = 1

2 dd i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ,

where | means taking the rst (leading, or -independent) component of a supereld
or an operator. the scalars a and the spinors  are the propagating elds, whereas
the scalars f are the auxiliary elds.

(2.3)

the general 4d nlsm is described by an action

snlsm[a] =

1

22z d4x gij(a)aiaj .

(2.4)

it has an n=1 supersymmetric extension if and only if the nlsm metric gij(a) is
kahler [27]. indeed, the most general n=1 supersymmetric action, in terms of n=1
chiral superelds and of the second order in spacetime derivatives of the physical
scalars, reads

s =z d4xd4 k(i, j) =  1

2z d4x ki

(2.6)

and similarly for k(i, j). the right-hand-side of eq. (2.5) has the standard nlsm
form (2.4) with the restricted (=kahler) metric

ds2 = ki

j(a, a)daid aj .

(2.7)

6

a complex manifold whose metric can be written down in the form (2.7) with a locally
dened potential k is called the kahler manifold [28]. the form of the supereld
nlsm action (2.5) is preserved under arbitrary reparametrizations of i and j.
the line element (2.7) is only preserved under holomorphic reparametrizations of ai
and aj, ai  f i(aj), while this can be extended to holomorphic transformations of
the chiral superelds, i  f i(j). the ricci tensor of a kahler metric reads

ri

j = {ln det(kk

m)},i

,j

.

(2.8)

having constructed the most general n=1 supersymmetric nlsm action (2.5)
in terms of a kahler potential k(, ), one can further impose extra non-manifest
(non-linear) supersymmetry on the action (2.5), in order to get n=2 nlsm. in the
absence of n=2 auxiliary elds, the extended n=2 supersymmetry algebra can be
closed only on-shell, i.e. on the equations of motion for the nlsm elds.

the most general ansatz for the transformation law of extra supersymmetry is

given by

i = d2( i) ,

 i = d2(i) ,

(2.9)

 = d2 =  = 0, and  is
where  is a constant chiral supereld parameter, d 

a function of  and  (modulo an additive chiral term). the on-shell closure of the
supersymmetry transformations (2.9) implies the relations [29]

i,j j,k =j,i k,j = k

j,[m| i,|k]

j = 0 ,

(2.10)

and their complex conjugates. the n=1 nlsm action (2.5) is invariant under the
transformations (2.9) provided that [29]

ji,m =  mj ,
mk i,j = 0 ,

j i,m = 0 .

(2.11)

this is to be compared to the eld equations following from the action (2.5),

d2ki = ki

2 ki

jk d 


j d



 k = 0 .

(2.12)

the rst two lines of eq. (2.11) imply that the third line of eq. (2.10) is equivalent
to the equation of motion (2.12), which conrms the on-shell closure of the n=2
supersymmetry algebra [29].

7

it is now straightforward to check that eqs. (2.10) and (2.11) together amount
to hyper-kahler geometry (appendix a). in particular, the quaternionic structure
(a.12) comprises the canonical complex structure j (3) of eq. (a.6) and the two non-
canonical complex structures

j (1)j

i =

0 j,i
j,i

0  ,

and j (2)j

i =

0

i j,i

ij,i

0  ,

(2.13)

with mixed (one covariant and one contravariant) indices  see the rst line of
eq. (2.10). both j (1) and j (2) are integrable due to the second line of eq. (2.10), while
they are covariantly constant due to the second and third lines of eq. (2.11). finally,
the nlsm metric is hermitian with respect to all three complex structures due to
the rst line of eq. (2.11). according to appendix a, this precisely amounts to the
hyper-kahler structure.

the canonical complex structure, j (3), is obviously related to the given kahler
structure of the n=1 nlsm that we started with. the coordinate system, where the
metric takes the kahler form with respect to a non-canonical complex structure, is,
therefore, related to the preferred one by a nonholomorphic coordinate transforma-
tion.

eq. (2.13) gives the complex structures in terms of the derivatives of the non-
holomorphic functions i and i introduced in eq. (2.9). those functions can be
reconstructed from a given kahler potential and one of the noncanonical complex
structures j [29]. since j anticommutes with the canonical complex structure, the
former can be written down in the form

(2.14)

ji

0 

0 ji
ji

j =
 , where

j ij =

ij
0

0
ij

with some matrix  and its complex conjugate . it now follows that j ij is block-
diagonal,

ij  (k 1)i

k

kj .

(2.15)

the covariant constancy of j implies that jk is holomorphic whereas jk is antiholo-
morphic, ijk = ijk = 0. similarly one nds that ij introduced in the rst line
of (2.11) is antiholomorphic whereas ij  ki

kkj is holomorphic.

it is now straightforward to verify that the functions [29]

i  ijkj

8

(2.16)

obey the desired relation

i,j = ij ,

(2.17)

and satisfy all the equations (2.10) valid for any hyper-kahler manifold. eqs. (2.15)
and (2.16) further imply that

ki i = 0

and i i = 0 .

(2.18)

one concludes that the hyper-kahler structure plays the most fundamental role in
the hyper-kahler geometry, since all other geometrical quantities can be constructed
in terms of it.

the n=1 superspace approach remains the most popular method in 4d supersym-
metry, mainly because it has a very simple and clear connection to the component
approach. however, n=1 superspace is clearly inadequate for n=2 supersymmetry
since only one of the supersymmetries can be manifestly realized there, whereas the
other supersymmtry is necessarily hidden, being non-linearly realized. the non-linear
dierential constraints implied by the second supersymmetry (see, e.g., eq. (a.13) in
appendix a) have to be solved, since their presence does not allow one to formulate
the most general ansatz for the n=2 hypermultiplet leea or, equivalently, for a
hyper-kahler nlsm. perhaps, most importantly, a simple treatment of isometries of
n=2 nlsm is hardly possible in n=1 superspace (subsect. 2.3). the isometries are
going to be crucial for our purposes in the next sections.

lets now introduce the n=2 source supereld lij = lji into eq. (2.26),

(2.29)

.

(2.30)

eqs. (2.29) and (2.30) dene the projective (generalized tensor) n=2 multiplets
for all n  2 [18]. they are irreducible o-shell representations of n=2 extended 4d
supersymmetry of superspin y = 0 and superisospin i = (n  2)/2, having 8(n  1)

(2.31)

it follows from matching the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom that the real
vector v
= 0, whereas the
vector elds v i3in
of the projective n=2 multiplets with n > 2 are all unconstrained.

choosing n = 1 in eq. (2.29) results in the on-shell constraints dening a fayet-
sohnius (fs) hypermultiplet (of vanishing central charge), with the only helicities
( 1
2 ,0), as required for a hypermultiplet [31]. the failure to incorporate the o-
shell (i.e. model-independent) fs hypermultiplet within the framework of the stan-
dard n=2 superspace has far reaching consequences in n=2 supersymmetry [23].

11

as regards the n=2 nlsm, it implies the impossibility to formulate the most gen-
eral, manifestly n=2 supersymmetric nlsm in the standard n=2 superspace. since
n=2 supersymmetry amounts to the hyper-kahler nlsm geometry, the roots of the
problem can be traced back to the basic properties of the hyper-kahler structure
(appendix a). to the end of this subsection, we argue that the twistor approach is
the natural way to solve this problem.

given a hyper-kahler manifold m, a linear combination, aj (1) + bj (2) + cj (3), of
its three, linearly independent and covariantly constant, complex structures satisfying
the quaternionic algebra (a.12), with arbitrary real parameters (a, b, c), is also the
covariantly constant complex srtructure provided that a2+b2+c2 = 1. hence, a hyper-
kahler manifold m possess the variety of non-canonical complex structures (on the
top of the canonical one), worthy of a two-sphere s2. this property of hyper-kahler
metrics is crucial for the eectiveness of the twistor approach providing the natural
framework for an explicit construction of hyper-kahler metrics in pss and hss (see
appendices b and c, respectively). in the hss approach one extends the ordinary
n=2 superspace by the two-sphere s2. by using the isomorphism s2  su(2)/u(1),
one can actually add the group su(2) instead, and consider only those hss super-
elds that are equivariant with respect to the u(1) symmetry  this mathematical
construction is known as a ag manifold [32]. the su(2) symmetry can be identied
with the n=2 supersymmetry automorphisms su(2)r that can be made manifest
in hss. in the pss construction one uses another isomorphism s2  cp (1), while
one extends the standard n=2 superspace by the complex projective line cp (1). the
su(2)r automorphisms are realized in pss by the (non-linear) projective transforma-
tions. though the hss approach is the most symmetric and universal, it also implies
the innite number of auxiliary elds, e.g. in the o-shell formulation of the fayet-
sohnius hypermultiplet. it makes the relation between the hss superelds and the
component approach to be highly non-trivial. the pss approach can be formulated
with a nite number of the auxiliary elds for a restricted class of n=2 nlsm, by
assuming a holomorphic (polynomial) dependence upon the cp (1) coordinate. al-
lowing a more general (e.g., meromorphic) dependence of projective n=2 multiplets
upon the cp (1) coordinate makes the pss method to be essentially equivalent to the
hss one (see appendix b for a technical inroduction into pss, and appendix c for
a technical introduction into hss).

the pss construction of the n=2 nlsm metrics can be summarized into a short
prescription known as the generalized legendre transform [33]. one considers sections
of o(2p) line bundles over cp (1), dened by all holomorphic polynomials of the

12

cp (1) projective coordinate , of order 2p (cf. eq. (b.2)),

q(2p)() = z + v + w22 + . . . + w2p22p2 + (1)p1v2p1 + (1)p z2p ,

(2.32)

subject to the reality condition (cf. eq. (2.30))

q(2p)() = (1)p 2pq(2p)(1/ ) .

one introduces the contour integral (cf. eqs. (b.10) and (b.25))

f =

1

2iic

d 2g(q(), )

(2.33)

(2.34)

in terms of a holomorphic function g(q(), ). a kahler potential k of the hyper-
kahler metric associated with the holomorphic input (g, c) is found by performing
the complex legendre transform with respect to v and v [33] (cf. eq. (b.26)),

k(z, z, u, u) = f (z, z, v, v, wa)  uv  uv ,

subject to

f

(2.35)

(2.36)

when simultaneously extremizing f with respect to all wa, where a = 2, . . . , 2p  2
(cf. eq. (b.23),

f
wa

= 0 .

(2.37)

the generalized legendre transform provides the very powerful method for an
explicit construction of hyper-kahler metrics, especially after taking into account the
polynomials to all orders in p = 1, 2, . . . . in fact, one has to take all of them in the
most general case. because of the non-linear algebraic relations associated with the
legendre transform, it seems to be very dicult to classify all hyper-kahler metrics
(e.g., according to their isometries) by using this method.

harmonic superspace (hss) can be independently justied by relaxing (i.e. lift-
ing o-shell) the fayet-sohnius hypermultiplet constraints (2.29) in the on-shell case
of n = 1. it can be achieved with the innite chain,

d(i

(2.38)

that involves all projective multiplets l(i1i2p+1) up to p = . the hypermultiplet
hss supereld q+ (see appendix c) is just equivalent to eq. (2.38). though it is
denitely possible to incorporate all relaxed projective supermultiplets, including the
one of eq. (2.38), into the framework of the pss construction (appendix b), it may
not be convenient in practice.

2.3

isometries of n=2 nlsm

as regards the general bosonic nlsm (2.4), its isometry (symmetry) lie group g
may have an isotropy subgroup h consisting of those transformations of g that leave
a point {ai} in the nlsm target space xed. the remaining symmetries of g move
the point {ai}, being non-linearly realised. the innitesimal action of g reads

ai = m ki

m (a) ,

(2.39)

where ki
m (a), m = 1, 2, . . . , dim g, are the killing vectors generating the group g
and satisfying the killing equation k(i;j)
m = 0, while m are (lie algebra) parameters.
the isotropy subgroup h(a) depends upon the point {ai} chosen. in adapted local
coordinates, associated with a given point ai, the group h(a) acts linearly, i.e.

ai = ix(tx)i

jaj ,

(2.40)

where tx are the hermitian generators of h(a). we follow ref. [29] here.

a description of isometries of a kahler manifold has some special features related
to the invariance of its complex structure under holomorphic transformations that do
not mix ai and aj. it is, therefore, natural to distinguish between the holomorphic
isometries possessing the same property, and the isometries that do not. the lie
derivative associated with a holomorphic killing vector leaves both the kahler metric
and the complex structure invariant [34]. the action of the holomorphic isotropy
subgroup in adapted coordinates reads

ai = ii

jaj ,

 ai = i ajj

i , where i

j = x(tx)i

j .

(2.41)

the kahler potential is generically invariant under the isometry modulo a kahler

gauge transformation,

k = (a) + ( a) ,

(2.42)

with a holomorphic function (a). in the isotropic case one can always choose the
kahler gauge where  vanishes, so that

k = ii

j(kiaj  k j ai) = 0 .

14

(2.43)

to describe general holomorphic isometries, one introduces killing vectors ka with

holomorphic components ki

a(a) and their complex conjugates kai( a) [29],
a  lkai ,

 ai = akai  lk ai .

ai = aki

(2.44)

in adapted coordinates, eq. (2.44) takes the form of eq. (2.43). the holomorphic and
antiholomorphic components of the killing vectors generate two separate isometry
algebras, and, in general coordinates, obey the killing equations

k i

jkj

a;k + k j

kkaj

;i = 0 .

(2.45)

eq. (2.45) implies the existence of the killing potential associated with a holomorphic
killing vector [34, 29].

since a hyper-kahler metric is fully characterized by its quaternionic or triholo-
morphic structure, it is also quite natural to distinguish between the triholomorphic
isometries preserving all three complex structures, and the non-triholomorphic isome-
tries that do not share this property. the triholomorphic isometries are also known
in the mathematical literature as translational, while they commute with n=2 super-
symmetry in the n=2 nlsm. the non-triholomorphic isometries are also called rota-
tional since the action of the corresponding killing vector on the complex structures
amounts to their rotation, while they do not commute with n=2 supersymmetry.

in real coordinates (appendix a), a triholomorphic killing vector km satises the

equation

pi

j(cid:16)p n

mkm(cid:17);j

= 0 ,

(2.46)

where we have used the projection operators of eq. (a.2). eq. (2.46) is equivalent to
the vanishing lie derivative of each complex structure j,

lkji

j = 0 .

(2.47)

in the special coordinates, where the complex structures have the form (a.6) and
(2.13), and the killing vector km are manifestly holomorphic with respect to the
canonical complex structure, the triholomorphicity condition reads [29]

or, equivalently,

ij kj

;m  jmki

;j = 0 ,

j[ikj

;m] = 0 .

(2.48)

(2.49)

the triholomorphic condition (2.46) or (2.47) can be considered as the integrability
condition for the existence of a real killing potential x (j) for each complex structure
j, which satises the dierential equation [29]
kijij = x (j)

(2.50)

,j

.

15

in the special coordinates, the existence of a real killing potential x (j) amounts to
the existence of a holomorphic killing potential p and an antiholomorphic killing
potential p to be dened with respect to j (1)  ij (2), respectively [29].

triholomorphic isometries of a hyper-kahler metric signicantly simplify an ex-
plicit construction of the metric. given an n=2 tensor multiplet amongst the argu-
ments of the pss construction (appendix b) or, equivalently, a section of the line
bundle o(2) in the generalized legendre transform, it always implies a translational
(or triholomorphic) isometry. this can be understood as the result of dualization
of the conserved vector amongst the components of the n=2 tensor multiplet. the
translational isometry is manifest in the corresponding kahler potential of eq. (b.13).
this property is not shared by the higher projective multiplets with n > 2.

in the hss approach, an analytic hypermultiplet supereld q+ and its analytic

q + naturally form an sp(1) doublet, qa+, where a = 1, 2. the free hyper-
conjugate
multiplet action (c.7) has the manifest sp(1) isometry, in addition to the manifest
su(2)r isometry. the u(1) subgroup of the sp(1) rotations is given by

q+  eiq+ and



q +  ei


q + ,

(2.51)

and it can be identied with the u(1)r symmetry.

in order to get the most general n=2 nlsm in hss, lets make the same trick as
in general relativity, where one goes from a at space metric in general coordinates
to the truly curved space metric. in hss we can assign extra sp(n) indices to the
hss superelds,

qa+  qa+ , a = 1, 2, . . . 2n ,

(2.52)

and apply a reparametrization,

qa+  qa+

= f a+(q, u) , with ui

inert ,

(2.53)

to the free hss action (appendix c)

sfree[qa] =

1

2zanalytic

q+
a d++qa+ .

(2.54)

one easily nds that the free action (2.54) gets transformed into

s[qa] =

1

2zanalyticnf +

a (q, u)d++qa+ + g(+4)(q, u)o

(2.55)

with the particular functions f +

a and g(+4) given by

f +
a = f +
b

f b+
qa+

and g(+4) = f +

b ++f b+ .

(2.56)

16

it is therefore eq. (2.56), with arbitrary complex functions f +
a (q, u) and a generic
real function g(+4)(q, u), that represents the most general n=2 nlsm in hss (cf.
ref. [35]). the action (2.56) is invariant under innitesimal eld reparametrizations,

qa+ = a+(q, u) ,

u

i = 0 ,

provided that

f +

a = f +
b

b+
qa+

and g(+4) = f +

a ++a+ .

(2.57)

(2.58)

the hss vielbein fa is the pure gauge eld with respect to the hss reparametriza-
tions, and it can be gauge-xed to the canonical form, f +
a , in adapted coor-
dinates on the nlsm target space. it results in the standard hss form of the n=2
nlsm action [36]:

a = q+

snlsm[q] =

1

2zanalyticnq+

ad++qa+ + k(+4)(q, u)o .

(2.59)

the function k(+4)(q, u) is knows as a hyper-kahler potential in hss [36].

since isometries are the symmetries of the nlsm action, not of the nlsm la-
grangian, in hss the latter may vary into a total harmonic derivative, l(+4) =
d++++(q, u), because of the identity

the action (2.55) is invariant under an innitesimal isometry transformation

qa+ = xxa+

(2.62)

(2.63)

by analogy with the n=1 superspace description of n=2 nlsm isometries, the an-
alytic hss supereld x++ is called the (triholomorphic) killing potential of the
(triholomorphic) killing vector xa+ in hss [35].

17

if the n=2 nlsm action (2.59) in adapted coordinates has a linearly realised

isometry, eq. (2.61) takes the form (cf. eqs. (2.40) and (2.41))

qa+ = ix(tx)a

where tx are the generators of h. the corresponding killing vectors are linear in q,

(3.1)
where the hyper-kahler potential k(+4) is an arbitrary function of an unconstrained
analytic hss supereld q+, its analytic conjugate
i . a function
k(+4) should be of u(1) charge (+4) in order to cancel the opposite u(1) charge of
the analytic measure in hss (appendix c). as regards the hypermultiplet leea
also having the form of eq. (3.1), its hyper-kahler potential plays the role similar to
that of the holomorphic seiberg-witten potential f in the abelian n=2 vector leea
[1]. because of manifest n=2 supersymmetry of eq. (3.1) describing the propagating
fayet-sohnius hypermultiplet degrees of freedom only, the equations of motion for
the hss action (3.1) determine (at least, in principle) the component hyper-kahler
nlsm metric in terms of a single hss potential k(+4).
it is not known how to
deduce an explicit nlsm metric from eq. (3.1) in the case of a generic hyperkahler
potential, though some explicit examples are available (appendix c).

a crucial simplication arises when the su(2)r symmetry is not broken, which
is the case for the hypermultiplet leea (sect. 1). since the su(2)r transformations
are linearly realised in hss, the su(2)r isometry of the hypermultiplet leea just
means that the corresponding hyper-kahler potential k(+4) should be independent
upon harmonics. this observation gives rise to the most general invariant ansatz
for the leea of a single hypermultiplet, in the form of the most general, of u(1)
charge (+4), harmonic-indepenent hyper-kahler potential,

k(+4) =

with one real () and two complex (, ) parameters. the sp(1) = su(2)pg trans-
formations of q+
a leave the form of eq. (3.2) invariant but not the coecients. since
su(2)pg is the symmetry of a free hypermultiplet action (c.7), it can be used to
reduce the number of coupling constants in the family of hyper-kahler metrics asso-
ciated with the hyper-kahler potential (3.2) from ve to two. in addition, eq. (3.2)
implies the conservation law [36],

d++k(+4) = 0 ,

(3.3)

which is valid on the equations of motion of the hypermultiplet hss supereld,

d++



q + = k(+4)/q+ and d++q+ = k(+4)/

(3.4)

3.1 the perturbative hypermultiplet leea

the manifestly n=2 supersymmetric hss description of the hypermultiplet leea
allows us to exploit the constraints imposed by unbroken n=2 supersymmetry and its
automorphism symmetry in the very ecient and transparent way. for example, as
regards a perturbation theory in 4d, n=2 supersymmetric qed (or in the coulomb
branch of n=2 supersymmetric su(2) yang-mills theory [1]), the unbroken symmetry
is given by

su(2)r, global  u(1)local .

(3.6)

just because this is the only function of u(1) charge (+4) that is independent upon
harmonics, being invariant under the u(1) phase transformations (2.51) too.

the induced coupling constant  of eq. (3.6) in the one-loop approximation can
be determined from a calculation of the hss graph shown in fig. 1. the analytic
propagator (the wave lines in fig. 1) of the n=2 vector hss supereld v ++ in n=2

the appearance of the quantum corrections given by integrals over a subspace of
the full n=2 superspace, like the one in eq. (3.6). however, this non-renormalization
theorem does not apply in the case under consideration, because of the non-vanishing
central charge z [22].

the infra-red divergence of the one-loop induced eective coupling  in eq. (3.10)
may cause concern about the consistency of our approach. it is worth mentioning,
however, that eq. (3.6) is manifestly n=2 supersymmetric at any . in other words,
the infra-red cuto is consistent with n=2 supersymmetry of the hypermultiplet
leea. we expect the ir divergences to disappear after summing up (ir-divergent)
higher-loop feynman supergraphs with four external fs hypermultiplets (fig. 2).

it seems to be rather dicult to calculate the exact dependence of  upon the fun-
damental parameters of the underlying gauge theory, such as the yang-mills coupling
constant, an n=2 central charge and a higgs expectation value, by using quantum
perturbation theory. the perturbative expansion in terms of feynman graphs assumes
the validity of the weak-coupling description associated with a particular choice of
elds and coupling constants in (a portion of) the quantum moduli space, whereas
the parameter  is essentially non-perturbative (cf. the fermi constant f in qcd).
nevertheless, the exact geometrical (taub-nut) nature of the result (3.6), associated
with a fundamental monopole belonging to the hypermultiplet under consideration, is
very clear in the hss approach. the coecient  is simply related to the taub-nut
mass,  = 1

4m 2 (see appendix c).

to understand the hyper-kahler geometry associated with the hyper-kahler po-
tential (3.6), one may perform an n=2 supersymmetric duality transformation of the
fs hypermultiplet to an n=2 tensor multiplet, and then rewrite the corresponding
dual hss action into pss. unlike the o-shell fs hypermultiplet, the o-shell n=2
tensor multiplet has the nite number of the auxiliary elds  see eq. (2.31). the
n=2 tensor multipet constraints (2.28) can be rewritten to hss as

d++l++ = 0 and


l ++ = l++ .

(3.11)

lets now make a substitution (we temporarily set  = 1)

tn = 1
k(+4)
2 (



q +q+)2 = 2(l++)2 ,

or, equivalently,


q +q+ = 2il++ ,

(3.12)

which is certainly allowed because of eq. (3.3). the constraints (2.28) can be taken
into account o-shell, by using an extra real analytic hss supereld  as the lagrange

21

multiplier. changing the variables from (
duality transformation in hss. an explicit solution to eq. (3.12) is known [38],


q +, q+) to (l++, ) amounts to the n=2

(3.14)

it is straightforward to rewrite the free (massless) hss action (c.7) in terms of
the new variables. this results in the improved (i.e. n=2 superconformally invariant)
n=2 tensor multiplet action [38],

simproved =

1

2z d (4)du(f ++)2 .

(3.15)

the action dual to the nlsm action dened by eq. (c.10) is, therefore, given by a
sum of the non-improved (quadratic) and improved (non-polynomial) hss actions for
the n=2 tensor multiplet [16, 38],

staubnut[l; ] = simproved +

1

2z d (4)duh(l++)2 + d++l++i .

(3.16)

to understand the peculiar structure of the improved action dened by eqs. (3.14)
and (3.15), one may extract a constant piece cij out of lij by rewriting it to the form

l++(, u) = c++ + l++(, u) .

(3.17)

we use the notation

c = ciju

i u

,

(cij) = ikjlckl ,

c2 =

cijcij 6= 0 ,

f ++(l, u)  l++f (y) ,

the function f (y) now appears to be a solution to the quadratic equation,

1

f (y)

= 1 +

yf (y)

4c2

,

(3.18)

(3.19)

that comes from requiring the rigid n=2 superconformal invariance on the improved
action (cf. ref. [38]). the action (3.15) does not really depend upon cij because of its
su(2)conf. invariance. the normalization constant c2 is the only relevant parameter.

it is also straightforward to rewrite eq. (3.16) to n=2 pss and even to n=1
superspace, where it takes the form of eqs. (b.3) and (b.10), respectively. after

(3.21)

in complex -plane. the hyper-kahler metric of the n=2 nlsm dened by eqs. (3.16)
and (3.20) is equivalent to the taub-nut metric after the n=1 superspace legendre
transform (see appendix b) [16], with the mass parameter m = 1
21/2. stated
dierently, eq. (3.6) describes the hyper-kahler potential of the taub-nut metric in
hss (apendix c).

the known u(2) = su(2)  u(1) isometry of the taub-nut metric is clearly
consistent with eq. (3.5). it is instructive to investigate the realization of this internal
symmetry in the various formulations of the n=2 taub-nut nlsm mentioned in
this paper. the hyper-kahler potential (3.6) in terms of the fs hypermultiplet q+
provides the manifestly invariant formulation.
in the dual hss form, in terms of
(l++, ), the non-abelian factor su(2) is represented by the su(2)conf., whereas the
abelian factor u(1) is realized by constant shifts of . the su(2)r transformations
act in pss in the form of projective (fractional) transformations (b.7).

eqs. (b.8) and (b.9) imply that the su(2)r invariant pss potential g(q(2))
should be almost linear in q(2), like in the second term of eq. (3.20) where the extra
logarithmic factor is merely responsible for dening the proper integration contour.
the transition ui  i = (1, ) describes a holomorphic projection of hss to pss
where the analytic supereld l++(, u) is replaced by a holomorphic (with respect
to ) section q(2)(l, ) of the line bundle o(2) whose ber is parametrized by the
constrained n=1 superelds,  and g. the equation y2 =   ig + 2  denes a

riemann sphere in c2 parametrized by (y, ), where y2  q(2)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12).

3.2 exact hypermultiplet leea and o(4) bundle

there are no instantons in an abelian n=2 supersymmetric quantum eld theory.
this means that the perturbative result of subsect. 3.1 about the hypermultiplet
leea described by the taub-nut metric is, in fact, exact in the abelian case. if,
however, the underlying n=2 gauge eld theory has a non-abelian gauge group whose

23

rank is larger than one, one may expect nonperturbative contributions to the hyper-
multiplet leea (in the higgs branch) from instantons and anti-instantons which
break the u(1)r symmetry (cf. ref. [10]).

given the most general su(2)r-invariant hyper-kahler potential (3.2), lets make

a substitution

k(+4)(q,
where the real analytic supereld l++++ satises the conservation law (3.3), i.e.

(q+) 4 + 

(q+) 3q+ + h.c.# = l++++(, u) , (3.22)

d++l++++ = 0 .

eq. (3.23) can be recognized as the o-shell n=2 superspace constraints

d

(iljklm) = d 


(iljklm) = 0 ,

while eq. (3.22) implies, in addition, the reality condition

(3.23)

(3.24)

(3.25)

dening together the o(4) projective n=2 supermultiplet (see subsect. 2.2. and
appendix b). unlike the o(2) tensor multiplet, the o(4) multiplet does not have
a conserved vector (or a gauge antisymmetric tensor) amongst its eld components,
which implies the absence of the u(1)r triholomorphic isometry in the n=2 nlsm
to be constructed in terms of l++++.

the n=2 supersymmetric pss construction of the invariant actions (appendix
b), in terms of a pss potential g(q(), ) equally applies to the projective o(4)
supermultiplets, while l++++ should enter the universal pss action (b.3) via the
argument

q(4)(z, ) = ijkllijkl(z) ,

i = (1, ) .

(3.26)

the n=1 superspace projections of eqs. (3.26) and (b.3) are given by eqs. (b.24) and
(b.25), respectively, in terms of the n=1 chiral supereld , the n=1 complex linear
supereld w , and the n=1 general (unconstrained) real supereld v .

the auxiliary eld component c of the o(4) projective multiplet, dened by
eq. (2.31) (or, equivalently, the n=1 supereld v in the n=1 superspace reformula-
tion) enters the pss action (b.3) as the lagrange multiplier, whose elimination via
its equation of motion gives rise to an algebraic constraint,

re i

(3.27)

eq. (3.27) reduces the number of independent physical real scalars from ve to four,
which is consistent with the fact that the real dimension of any hyper-kahler manifold
is a multiple of four (appendix a). after solving the constraint (3.27), the complex
linear n=1 supereld w can be traded for yet another n=1 chiral supereld , by
the use of the n=1 supereld legendre transform. it results in the n=1 superspace
kahler potential k(, , , ) of the n=2 supersymmetric nlsm (appendix b).

the most straightforward procedure of calculating the dependence q(l) out of
the denition (3.22), as well as performing an explicit n=2 supersymmetric duality
transformation of the free fs action (c.7) into the dual (improved) action of the
constrained n=2 supereld lijkl dened by eqs. (3.24) and (3.25), requires knowing
roots of the quartic polynomial. though it is possible to calculate the roots, the
results are not very illuminating. in fact, the explicit roots are not even necessary to
determine the explicit form of the dual n=2 pss action. within the manifestly n=2
supersymmetric approach, it is the su(2)r symmetry and regularity requirements
that are sucient to x the action in question, either in hss or pss (cf. ref. [38]). the
one real and two complex constants, (, , ), respectively, parametrizing the hyper-
kahler potential (3.22) can be naturally united into an su(2) 5-plet cijkl subject to the
a + q+
reality condition (3.25). after extracting a constant piece out of q+, say, q+
a
and ua = (1, ), and collecting all constant pieces on the left-hand-side of eq. (3.22),
we can identify their sum with a constant piece c++++ = cijklu+
l of l++++
on the right-hand-side of eq. (3.22), representing the constant vacuum expectation
values of the n=1 supereld components of l++++,

the su(2)r transformations in pss are the projective transformations (b.7), so
that the pss potential g of the improved o(4) projective multiplet action having

the form (b.3) must be proportional toqq(4) just because of the transformation rules
(a + b)4 q(4)() . (3.29)
the most general non-trivial contour cr in complex -plane, whose denition is com-
patible with the projective su(2) symmetry, is the one encircling the roots of the
quartic (cf. eq. (3.21)),

q(4)()(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = p + q + 2r  3 q + 4 p ,

(3.30)

with one real (r) and two complex (p, q) additional parameters belonging to yet
another 5-plet of su(2)pg = sp(1). the projective su(2) invariance can be used

25

to reduce the number of independent parameters in the corresponding family of the
hyper-kahler metrics from ve to two, which is consistent with the hss predictions. 2
we didnt attempt to establish the explicit relation between the hss coecients
(, , ) and the pss coecients (r, q, p). the most natural contour cr, surrounding
roots of the equation

q(4)() = 0 ,

(3.31)

leads to the only non-singular hyper-kahler nlsm metric (see subsect. 3.3).

taking all the above together implies that the su(2)-invariant pss action, dual

to the hss action dened by eqs. (3.1) and (3.2), is given by

the generalized legendre transform of the function (3.32) is known [39], so we may
now borrow some of the results of ref. [39].

due to the reality condition (3.25), the quartic equation (3.31) has two pairs of
roots (,1/) related by an sl(2, z) transformation and satisfying the dening
relation

q(4)() = c(  1)(1 + 1)(  2)(2 + 1) .

(3.34)

the branch cuts in complex -plane can be chosen to run from 1 to 1/2 and
from 2 to 1/1. the contour integration in eq. (3.33) can then be reduced to the
complete elliptic integral (in the legendre normal form) over the branch cut [39],

(3.38)

v = 4h3 cos(2) sin2  + (2k2  1)(1  3 cos2 )i k 2(k) ,

where the euler angles (, , ) and the modulus k have been introduced. they
actually represent the independent (supereld) coordinates in the n=2 nlsm under
consideration.

applying the complex legendre transform (2.35) to the function (3.32) with re-
spect to w , on the constraint (2.37) having the form (3.35) here, gives rise to the
(double cover of) atiyah-hitchin (ah) space m2 as the nlsm target space [39]. in
fact, it was demonstrated in ref. [39] that the ansatz (3.32) gives rise to the hyper-
kahler structure of the ah space. this is, however, enough to claim the equivalence
between the n=2 nlsm metric in question and the ah hyper-kahler metric, in
accordance with our discussion in subsect. 2.1.

the ah space m2 was originally introduced as the (centered) moduli space of two
bps su(2) monopoles [12]. the metric of the ah space is known to be the only
regular hyper-kahler metric with the entirely non-triholomorphic so(3) symmetry
rotating hyper-kahler complex structures [12]. in the donaldson description [40] of
the ah space (see subsection 4.2 for basic denitions), the ah space m2 is described
by the quotient of an algebraic curve in c3,

x2  zy2 = 1 , where x, y, z  c ,

(3.39)

under z2 :
(x, y, z)  (x,y, z). eq. (3.39) thus describes the su(2)-symmetric
universal (2-fold) covering m2 of the ah space. since our n=2 superspace techniques
are purely local, we are unable to distinguish between m2 and m2. accordingly, we
make no distinction between so(3) and su(2) in our considerations. 3

the line element of any four-dimensional (euclidean) metric having so(3) isom-

etry can be written down in the bianchi ix formalism as follows:

ds2 = f 2(t)dt2 + a2(t)2

1 + b2(t)2

2 + c 2(t)2
3 ,

(3.40)

3see, however, ref. [8] for a discussion of the global issues associated with m2 and m2.

i  j = 1

2 ijkdk ,

i, j, k = 1, 2, 3 .

(3.41)

(3.42)

the standard parametrization of the ah metric uses the complete elliptic integrals

(3.37) and the modulus k related to the variable t of eq. (3.40) via the relation

t = 

2k(k)
k(k)

,

(3.43)

where k is known as the complementary modulus, k2 = 1  k2. the ah metric in
terms of the independent coordinates (k; , , ) reads [12]

bc =  k(k)he(k)  k2k(k)i ,
ac =  k(k)e(k) .

(3.44)

(3.45)

the parametrization (3.38) leads to the ah metric in the form (3.44) whose coecient
functions (a, b, c) are given by a cyclic permutation of those in eq. (3.45) [39]. the
kahler potential of the ah metric was calculated in ref. [41].

in the limit k  1 (or, equivalently, k  0), one has an asymptotic expansion

k(k)   log k"1 +

4 # + . . . ,

(3.46)

(3.47)

which suggests us to make a redenition

k = 1  k2  4 exp  1

! ,

and describe the same limit at   0. after substituting eq. (3.46) into eq. (3.45)
one nds that the ah metric becomes exponentially close to the taub-nut metric
in the form (3.40) subject to the additional relations

(3.48)

and with the negative mass parameter m =  1
2 [12]. going back to the general
hyper-kahler potential (3.2) whose taub-nut parameter  is xed as above, we are
left with the one-parameter family of the hyper-kahler metrics, all having the same
perturbative behaviour. the unique solution given by the ah metric follows from
a calculation of the one-instanton contribution to the leea, which unambigously
determines the remaining parameter [11] (see subsect. 3.3. also). the results of
ref. [11] also imply that the absolute value of  is proportional to the one-instanton
action.

the extra u(1)r symmetry of the taub-nut metric is the direct consequence of
the relation a2 = b2 arising from the ah metric in the asymptotic limit described
by eq. (3.48). the vicinity of k  0+ describes the region of the hypermultiplet
moduli space where quantum perturbation theory applies, with the exponentially
small (nonholomorphic) ah corrections to the taub-nut metric being interpreted
as the instanton/anti-instanton contributions. those nonperturbative corrections are
apparently related to the existence of bps monopoles in the underlying non-abelian
n=2 eld theory. the ah metric, as the metric in the hypermultiplet quantum
moduli space, was proposed by seiberg and witten [8] in the context of 3d, n=4
supersymmetric gauge eld theories, where it can be related to the (seiberg-witten)
gauge leea [1] via the c-map in three spacetime dimensions (sect. 1).

from the n=2 pss viewpoint, the transition from the perturbative hypermulti-
plet leea to the nonperturbative one corresponds to the transition from the o(2)
holomorphic line bundle associated with the standard n=2 tensor supermultiplet to
the o(4) holomorphic line bundle associated with the o(4) n=2 supermultiplet. the
two holomorphic bundles are topologically dierent: with respect to the standard
covering of cp (1) by two open ane sets, the o(2) bundle has transition functions
1, whereas the o(4) bundle has transition functions 2. the variable q is the
coordinate of the ber over cp (1).

3.3 the elliptic curve for atiyah-hitchin metric

the quadratic dependence of q(2) upon  in eqs. (b.2) and (b.10) allows us to interpret
q(2)() as a holomorphic (of degree 2) section of pss, bered by the superelds
(, g) and topologically equivalent to a (genus-zero) riemann sphere, described by

an algebraic equation y2 =   ig + 2 with y2  q(2)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12). similarly, the quartic

dependence of q(4) upon  in eqs. (b.2) and (3.26) allows us to interpret q(4)() as
a holomorphic (of degree 4) section of pss, bered by the superelds (, w, v ) and

29

topologically equivalent to the elliptic curve hyper. dened by an algebraic equation

y2() =  + w + 2v  3w + 4 ,

(3.49)

where y2  q(4)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12). the non-perturbative hypermultiplet leea can, therefore, be

encoded in terms of the genus-one riemann surface hyper. [42]. this result is quite
similar to the famous seiberg-witten description [1] of the exact leea in the su(2)
n=2 super-yang-mills theory, in terms of the elliptic curve sw.

the classical twistor construction of hyper-kahler metrics [12] is known to be
closely associated with the spectral elliptic curve h [43]. the hurtubise curve h
naturally arises in the process of uniformization of the algebraic curve (3.39), in the
donaldson description of the ah space [44]. taken together, this evidence allows us
to identify h with hyper. [42].

the dening equation (3.49) can be put into the normal (hurtubise) form [12]

y2( ) = k 2(k) hkk( 2  1) + (k2  k2) i .

(3.50)

eq. (3.50) is simply related to another standard (weierstrass) form, y2 = 4x3g2xg3
[45]. therefore, in accordance with refs. [12, 45], the real period  of h is

  4k1 , where

4k2

1 = kkk 2(k) ,

whereas the complex period matrix of h is given by

 =

ik(k)
k(k)

.

(3.51)

(3.52)

the normal form (3.50) is related to that of eq. (3.49) by the projective su(2)

where   log(cid:16)tan 

2(cid:17) + i. the parametrization (3.55) is related to that of eq. (3.38)

by a cyclic permutation of the coecient functions (a, b, c) in eq. (3.44).

at generic values of the ah modulus k, 0 < k < 1, the roots of the weierstrass
form are all dierent from each other, while they all lie on the real axis, say, at
e3 < e2 < e1 <  = (e4). accordingly, the branch cuts are running from e3 to e2
and from e1 to . the cr integration contour in the pss formulation of the exact
hypermultiplet leea in eq. (3.32) can now be interpreted as the contour integral
over the non-contractible -cycle of the elliptic curve h [44], again in very close
analogy to the standard writing of the seiberg-witten solution [1] in terms of the
abelian dierential sw integrated over the periods of sw.

the perturbative (taub-nut) limit k  1 corresponds to the situation when
e2  e1, so that the -cycle of h degenerates. the curve (3.50) then asymptotically
approaches a complex line, y  k . another limit, k  0, leads to a coordinate
bolt-type singularity of the ah metric in the standard parameterization (3.44) [12].
in the context of monopole physics, k  0 corresponds to the coincidence limit of
two centered monopoles. in the context of the hypermultiplet leea, k  0 implies
e2  e3, so that the -cycle of h degenerates, as well as the whole hypermultiplet
action associated with eq. (3.32). the two limits, k  1 and k  0, are related by
the modular transformation exchanging k with k, and -cycle with -cycle [44].

the ah metric is known to be only regular and complete four-dimensional hyper-
kahler metric with the purely rotational so(3) isometry [12, 46, 47]. being regular
means the absence of singularities, while completeness means that every curve of nite
length in the hyper-kahler manifold under consideration has a limiting point. it is
worth mentioning that only regular (i.e. globally well-dened) hyper-kahler metrics
can be interpreted as the metrics governing the hypermultiplet leea. since the most
general four-dimensional su(2)-invariant hyper-kahler metrics in hss are given by
the two-parametric family described by the hyper-kahler potential (3.2), it is, there-
fore, very imporant to determine the reason by which one can distinguish the regular
ah metric amongst them. this problem is also present in the generalized legendre
transform construction of hyper-kahler metrics (appendix b). our results suggest

31

a simple solution. as was shown in the preceeding subsect. 3.2, the most general
integration contour cr in the pss construction (3.32) is described by eq. (3.30). as
is clear from the results of this subsection, any non-trivial contour cr can be equally
interpreted as a linear conbination, cr = n1 + n2, of the fundamental cycles,  and
, of the underlying elliptic curve sh, with some real coecients, n1 and n2. since
an integration over  yields the bolt-type singularity [12], it should be excluded,
n2 = 0. the contour integration over  just yields the regular ah solution, whereas
the remaining scale parameter can be absorbed into the taub-nut mass.

4 more hypermultiplets and larger gauge groups

if the underlying n=2 supersymmetric gauge eld theory has a larger (of rank r > 1)
simple gauge group, such as su(n + 1), n > 1, there may be more (magnetically
charged) massive hypermultiplets qa+, a = 1, 2, . . . , 2n, in the leea, either in the
coulomb branch or in the higgs branch. their exact self-interaction is described by
the hyper-kahler nlsm governed by a hyper-kahler potential k(+4)(qa+; u
i ) in hss,

lleea = q+

a d++qa+ + k(+4)(qa+; u

i ) .

(4.1)

the non-anomalous su(2)r symmetry further implies that the hyper-kahler po-
tential k(+4) should be independent upon harmonics. therefore, the analytic function
k(+4) is given by a real quartic polynomial of the analytic hss superelds qa+,

k(+4)(q) = p (+4)(q)  abcdqa+qb+qc+qd+ ,

(4.2)

whose coecients (abcd) are totally symmetric and are subject to the reality con-

in a bit more explicit notation, qa+ = (q+

not all of the constants are really signicant since the kinetic terms in eq. (4.1)
have the manifest global sp(n) symmetry under the transformations of qa+. hence,
the space of all su(2)r-invariant hyper-kahler metrics in 4n real dimensions is
parametrized by the quotient

tm = {p (+4)()}/sp(n) .

(4.4)

it may not be accidental that the sp(n) factor in eq. (4.4) coincides with the maximal
sp(n) holonomy group of hyper-kahler manifolds in 4n real dimensions.

4.1 exact hypermultiplet leea in the coulomb branch

in the coulomb branch of the n=2 super-yang-mills theory with the su(n + 1)
gauge group, the su(n + 1) symmetry is spontaneously broken to its maximal cartan
subgroup h = u(1)n, due to a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value, hi 6= 0, of
the adjoint higgs eld. since 2[su(n + 1)/u(1)n] = 1[u(1)n] = zn, one expects
rank(g) = n dierent types of magnetic monopoles associated to each of the cartan
generators and belonging to hypermultiplets. the corresponding classical solitonic
solutions can be obtained via embedding the known su(2) solutions (see appendix
d) along the simple root directions in g (see ref. [13], and a recent review [48]). as
regards the leea of the hypermultiplets corresponding to dierent simple roots, it
must thus have the tri-holomorphic (or translational) u(1)n isometry, in addition to
the rotational su(2)r isometry discussed above. in this subsection, we present a very
simple derivation of the corresponding hyper-kahler potential in hss, and give the
associated hyper-kahler metric in components.

first, lets recall some basic facts about lie algebras and monopoles [49]. the
generators of a rank-r lie algebra 4 can be naturally divided into r commuting cartan
generators {hi}, and the raising and lowering operators, e~ and e~, for each of the
r-component root vectors {~},

hi, hj = 0 ,

e~, ~h = ~e~ ,

e~, e~ = ~  ~h .

(4.5)

we assume the standard normalization, tr(hihj) = ij. the root vectors dene a
root lattice, while any root vector can be decomposed with respect to a basis of simple
(fundamental) roots {~i} with non-negative integral coecients,

~ =

rxi=1

ni~i .

(4.6)

the simple root basis is not unique, with all choices being related by the weyl group
transformations. the dual root lattice is dened by

~ =

rxj=1

n
j ~

j , where

~
j = ~j/~2
j .

(4.7)

given g = su(n + 1), one has ~i  ~i > 0 and ~i  ~j  0 for i 6= j; while r = n.

the vacuum expectation value of the higgs eld can always be assigned to the

cartan subalgebra,

4most of our considerations apply to any simple lie group g. we use su (n + 1) for deniteness.

hi = ~h  ~h .

(4.8)

33

if ~h  h has non-vanishing products with all roots of g, as we assume here, the
group g is maximally broken to its cartan subgroup. the unique set of simple roots
is naturally distinguished by the condition

~h  ~i > 0 , where

1  i  r .

(4.9)

a magnetic charge is characterized by another vector ~g  h. the topological
(dirac) quantization condition on the magnetic charge implies that ~g belongs to the
dual lattice (cf. appendix d),

~g =

m =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)~h  ~g(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ,

mj =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)~h  ~gj(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ,

so that the mass spectrum of the fundamental monopoles (of unit charge) is given by

j = 1, 2, . . . , r .

(4.12)

the long-range force between two dierent monopoles i and j obeys the standard
(inverse radius squared) law, whose strength is given by the inner product of magnetic
charges, ~gi  ~gj/4 [48, 49]. the classical solitonic solutions, describing su(n + 1)
monopoles, can be constructed, in principle, by the adhmn method [50], whose input
(nahm) data is, however, highly constrained by some non-linear ordinary dierential
equations. it makes the most direct construction of the multi-monopole moduli space
metrics via the so-called moduli space approximation [24] to be highly non-trivial.

each of n (translational) commuting u(1) isometries can be realized by rigid phase

we thus conclude, from the symmetry considerations alone, that the hypermultiplet
leea decomposes into the sum of the single hypermultiplet self-interactions and
their pairwise interactions.

moreover, the equations of motion for the q-superelds, in the presence of any
su(2)r-invariant self-interaction k(+4)(q), imply the conservation laws d++l++
m = 0

m = l++
m .
for the composite hss superelds (4.14) subject to the reality condition
in other words, l++
m can be recognized as the n=2 tensor multiplets (cf. sect. 3).
this conrms the claim [51] that the exact metric on the moduli space of n distinct
monopoles in a spontaneously broken su(n + 1) pure gauge theory can be obtained
by the generalized legendre transform in terms of sections of the o(2) holomorphic
bundle only. in our terms, this result comes after dualizing the hss action (4.15) into
pss by the n=2 duality transformation (4.14). the equivalent pss action is given
by the sum of the non-improved and improved terms [51],

the metric (4.18)(4.21) was rst identied by lee, weinberg and yi [13] as the
asymptotic metric in the multi-monopole moduli space for the n distinct fundamental
monopoles corresponding to all dierent simple (or fundamental) roots. because of
its origin, this metric is sometimes called the multi-taub-nut metric. since the inner
products of the dual fundamental roots in the case of su(n + 1) can only be either
zero or negative, the hyper-kahler metric (4.18)(4.21) appears to be regular and
geodesically complete [13]. subsequently, it was further argued by the same authors
[13] that the metric found may actually be exact in this case (see ref. [48] too). as
was demonstrated by chalmers [51], by the use of the generalized legendre transform
based on eq. (4.17), the lee-weinberg-yi metric is unique, indeed. our presentation,
based on the hss approach, apparently makes the proof of this statement to be
simpler and more transparent.

if one deals with the similar monopoles (or hypermultiplets) labelled by the same
root (say, ~g1), the multi-taub-nut metric develops a singularity in the core re-
gion at r = ~g2
1/(4m), where the similar monopoles approach each other [13]. this
situation is apparently quite similar to the one described by the ah metric whose
asymptotic behaviour is given by the taub-nut metric with the negative mass pa-
rameter (sect. 3). it also implies that the exact metric described by the most general
hyper-kahler potential (4.3) should generalize the ah metric in some highly non-
trivial way.

4.2 on elliptic curve, non-abelian leea, and rational maps

a generic real quartic polynomial p (+4)(q) may have no translational isometries at all.
the problem of extracting the explicit hyper-kahler metric associated with a generic
hyper-kahler potential (4.2) then essentially reduces to a determination of the proper
set of composite analytic hss superelds of the second- and forth-order in q+, which
would allow one to make an n=2 duality transformation, if any, from hss to pss,
and thus get rid of the auxiliary elds. at least one such variable always exists, and
it is given by the hyper-kahler potential p (+4)(q) itself, because the conservation
law (3.3) is still valid for any number of the fs hypermultiplets subject to their
equations of motion (3.4). in general, it gives rise to the o(4) projective multiplet
l++++ = p (+4)(q) as one of the action-angle variables. if p (+4)(q) can be represented
as a quadratic polynomial squared, the role of l++++ is obviously replaced by an n=2
tensor multiplet. one can easily imagine mixed situations, where dualizing the hss
potential p (+4)(q) can be performed with some number of o(2) and o(4) projective
supermultiplets. some of the mixed pss actions were considered in ref. [51].

36

our general classication of the multi-monopole moduli space metrics, based on
eq. (4.2), is not limited to the value of magnetic charge ki  2, used in ref. [51], which
leads to the multi-atiyah-hitchin family of metrics obtained by gluing together
several ah metrics. nevertheless, given at least one relevant o(4) holomorphic pro-
jection provided by l++++ = p (+4)(q), we expect the most general (4n-dimensional)
hyper-kahler metric in the hypermultiplet leea (or, equivalently,
in the multi-
monopole moduli space) to share some of the key properties of the four-dimensional
ah metric. perhaps, the most noticable feature is the existence of the elliptic curve
h (see subsect. 3.3). since a generic metric to be constructed out of p (+4) is expected
to be singular and incomplete, it is important to formulate the criteria that would
render it well-dened. because of the fact that, in the four-dimensional ah case, the
answer was found in terms of the proper integration contour in pss, it is tempting
to conjecture that a regular metric always corresponds to the pss integraton contour
given by the -cycle of h. after all, its asymptotic form has to be given by the
multi-taub-nut metric (subsect. 4.1), which yields yet another constraint upon the
coecients of the quartic (4.2). whether those constraints are enough to uniquely x
the metric is yet to be investigated.

it should be emphasized that in our approach, based on hss, one may easily treat
all types of the gauge symmetry breaking. we only considered above the case of
the maximal symmetry breaking of the gauge group g down to its cartan subgroup.
more general patterns of the gauge symmetry breaking are possible, with the unbroken
subgroup being of the form k  u(1)rk, where k is a non-abelian (of rank k < r)
subgroup of g. it happens when the vector ~h  h, dening the vacuum expectation
value of the higgs eld in eq. (4.8), is orthogonal to the simple roots of k. the
unbroken symmetry should be simply imposed on the hypermultiplet leea as its
isometry. in other words, it just restricts the hyper-kahler potential (4.3) to be a
function of the k  u(1)rk invariants only, which considerably restricts the form of
the quartic (4.3). in addition, the magnetic charge ~g is supposed to commute with
the unbroken symmetry, which implies [48]

~g  ~i = 0

(4.22)

for all simple roots ~i of k, i = 1, 2, . . . , k.

in the case of massless monopoles and hypermultiplets, some of the diagonal
it does not, however, imply that
coecients of the quartic (4.3) become innite.
the hss description becomes invalid. although it means that some rescalings are
necessary. this is particularly clear in the pss description, in terms of the n=2

37

tensor multipets, where eq. (4.17) apparently continues to be valid, even if some of
the masses mi vanish.

to the end of this subsection, we briey comment on a relation between our
classication scheme of the multi-monopole space metrics in the su(n + 1) case
and the donaldson classication [40] of charge-n monopoles in the su(2) yang-mills-
higgs system (appendix d). the latter represents the situation which is just opposite
to the one discussed in the preceeding subsect. 4.1, when now all monopoles (or
hypermultiplets) under consideration are similar, i.e. they belong to a single root of
g (cf. refs. [9, 10]).

the classication of charge-n monopoles in the su(2) yang-mills-higgs system
(appendix d) proposed by donaldson [40] makes use of the rational maps dened by

s(z) =

p(z)
q(z) 

(4.23)

j=0 ajzj

pn1
zn +pn1

j=0 bnjzj

in rn(z). it is assumed that the roots, i, of q(z) and the values p(i) are dierent,
while p(i) 6= 0 for all i. this allows one to introduce a holomorphic 2-form,

 =

nxj=1

dj  d ln p(j) ,

(4.24)

in the space of the rational maps. the form  is closed, symmetric under any exchange
of i, and symplectic in rn(z). remarkably, there exists a one-to-one correspondence
between the (universal cover of) charge-n monopole congurations and the rational
maps s(z) [40]. this statement is often referred to as the donaldson theorem [12].
for example, the existence of the form (4.24) can be translated into the existence of
the hyper-kahler structure (appendix a).

to make this correspondence more explicit, it is worth mentioning that the input
provided by the rational map (4.23) naively has 4n real parameters given by real and
imaginary parts of the complex coecients (ai, bj). since the function s(z) transforms
as the (chiral) 2d conformal eld [52] under the transformations

ai  iai ,

bi  ibi ,

(4.25)

with the complex parameter , the map s(z) is merely dependent upon (4n 2) real
parameters only. the gauge symmetry (4.25) can be xed, for example, by choosing
a gauge bn1 = 0. the equation

n(p, q) 

nyj=1

38

p(j) = 1 ,

(4.26)

where n(p, q) is known as the resultant of the map s(z), denes the algebraic man-

ifold fm n of real dimension 4(n 1). the resultant also has a cyclic symmetry under

the transformations

n :

ai  qai , where

qn = 1 .

(4.27)

it is the quotient space fm n/n that is supposed to be identied with the charge-n

(centered) monopole moduli space (cf. eq. (3.39) for the ah space). for example,
setting n = 1 and bn1 = 0 corresponds to choosing the overall phase and location of
the n-monopole to be zero [9]. it is now easy to verify that the donaldson description
of the ah space in eq. (3.39) follows from eq. (4.26) in the case of n = 2.

our classication in terms of the quartic polynomials (4.2) is not one-to-one, while,
in the context of the monopole moduli spaces, it refers to the uncentered moduli
spaces. when dealing with the quotient of eq. (4.4), after extracting the center-of-
mass motion of monopoles, we expect our classication to become a truly one-to-one
correspondence, thus generalizing the donaldson result. a proof of this statement is,
however, beyond the scope of this paper and, perhaps, beyond the expertise of the
author.

since the hss method can be considered as the very particular application of ag
manifolds in the twistor approach to a construction of the hyper-kahler metrics on
the multi-monopole moduli spaces, the hss method may also be useful for a construc-
tion of the classical monopole solutions themselves. for instance, a correspondence
between su(n + 1) monopoles and rational maps of the riemann sphere into ag
manifolds was recently proved in ref. [53], whereas the relevance of harmonic maps
in this connection was recently emphasized in ref. [54]. it would be interesting to
explore their possible relations to hss.

5 conclusion

our results are summarized in the abstract of the paper. we conclude with a few
remarks of general nature.

the 4d twistor approach has many similarities with the inverse scattering method
in the theory of (lower dimensional) integrable systems. it its turn, the integrable sys-
tems are known to be closely connected to the hyper-kahler geometry and the theory
of riemann surfaces [55]. in our approach to a construction of the 4d hypermultiplet
leea, it was the passage from the n=2 harmonic superspace (hss) to the n=2

39

projective superspace (pss) that provided the link of harmonic analysis to complex
analysis and thus allowed us to introduce the holomorphic quantities. the latter were
then interpreted in terms of the elliptic curve h. for example, the uniformization of
the ah algebraic curve (3.39) describing the ah space is known to be closely related
to the continual 3d toda equation [44] that, in its turn, naturally arises in the large
n limit of 2d conformal eld theories [52].

it is also remarkable that the very simple quartic ansatz of eq. (4.2) for the hyper-
kahler potential in hss provides the exhaustive (though, not one-to-one) description
of the highly non-trivial family of the hyper-kahler metrics on the classical multi-
monopole moduli spaces, which naturally generalize the standard (four-dimensional)
taub-nut and atiyah-hitchin metrics to higher dimensions. the related hypermul-
tiplet leea has manifest n=2 supersymmetry and the su(2)r internal symmetry.
in particular, the n=2 nlsm in hss with the atiyah-hitchin metric has the natu-
ral holomorphic projection to n=2 pss, where it is associated with the holomorphic
o(4) line bundle. a similar projection still exists in the general (higher dimensional)
case.

the non-perturbative (instanton) corrections to the hypermultiplet leea are
dictated by the hidden (in 4d) elliptic curve parametrizing the exact solution. since
the seiberg-witten curve sw is known to have the simple geometrical interpretation
in m-theory, where it can be considered as the part of a magnetically charged ve-
brane worldvolume wrapped about sw [56], it is conceivable that the hypermultiplet
elliptic curve h may have, perhaps, a similar geometrical interpretation to be related
to d-6-branes in ten-dimensional spacetime [23].

appendix a: abc of hyper-kahler geometry

a full account of complex geometry, including the hyper-kahler one, is available in the
mathematical literature, see e.g., the books [28, 57]. we follow here the presentation
of ref. [29] adapted for physicists.

lets consider a manifold m of real dimension 2k, covered by a system of coordi-
nate neighbourhoods (charts) {xi}. the coordinates in an intersection of two charts
are supposed to be related by smooth and locally invertible transition functions.

(a.1)

the manifold m equipped with an almost complex structure is called an almost

in this case j is called a complex structure, while m is called a complex manifold. the
complex manifold is characterized by holomorphic transition functions. eq. (a.4) is

(a.6)

the existence of a system of complex coordinate charts in which the almost complex
structure has the form (a.6) is equivalent to the integrability condition (a.4) [28].

given a riemannian manifold m with a metric gij and an (almost) complex
j, the invariance of the metric with respect to the complex structure

means

ji

kjj

mgkm = gij ,

or, equivalently, jij  gjkji

k = jji

.

(a.7)

the metric satisfying eq. (a.7) is called hermitian.

an (almost) complex manifold equipped with a hermitian metric is called an
(almost) hermitian manifold. the hermitian manifold thus possesses the fundamental
2-form

  jij dxi  dxj .

(a.8)

in the special coordinates (where the complex structure j is of the canonical form),
the fundamental 2-form reads

 = 2igij dzi  dzj

.

(a.9)

an (almost) kahler manifold is the (almost) hermitian manifold with the closed

fundamental form,

d = 0

or, equivalently, j[ij,k] = 0 .

(a.10)

as is clear from eqs. (a.9) and (a.10), the metric of a kahler manifold can be (locally)
expressed in terms of a kahler potential. the conditions (a.5) and (a.10) together
are equivalent to the covariant constancy of the complex structure,

k = 0 .

ijj

(a.11)

an (almost) quaternionic structure is the set of three linearly independent (almost)

complex structures ji

(a.12)

a manifold with the quaternionic structure is called a quaternionic manifold. if a
quaternionic manifold possesses a metric that is hermitian with respect to all three
covariantly constant complex structures, the manifold is called hyper-kahler. in other
words, a hyper-kahler manifold is characterized by three linearly independent com-
plex structures satisfying the quaternionic algebra, while there exists the coordinate
system for any given complex structure where it takes the canonical form (a.6).

42

any hyper-kahler manifold is ricci-at. in fact, the hyper-kahler condition is
equivalent to the ricci-atness together with the kahler condition.
imposing the
ricci-atness condition on a kahler potential k  see eq. (2.8)  results in the
non-linear partial dierential equation,

det(ki

j) = 1 ,

(a.13)

known as monge-ampere equation [16].

perhaps, the most elegant description of hyper-kahler geometry is possible in
terms of holonomy, whose generators are the components of the riemannian curva-
ture. given a riemannian manifold of real dimension 4n, it is hyper-kahler if and
only if its holonomy is a subgroup of sp(n). the case of n = 1 is special since the
most general 4d holonomy group factorizes, o(4) = su(2)  su(2). self-duality
of the riemann curvature means that the holonomy is a subgroup of su(2). since
su(2) = sp(1), it is clear that a hyper-kahler manifold is always (anti)self-dual and
vice versa [12].

appendix b: n=2 projective superspace (pss)

the idea of n=2 projective superspace (pss) naturally comes out of the eorts to con-
struct an n=2 supersymmetric self-interaction of the projective o(n) multiplets satis-
fying the constraints (2.29) and (2.30) [17, 18]. lets introduce a function g(la; , ),
whose arguments are given by some number (a = 1, 2, . . .) of the o(n) projective mul-
tiplets (of any type with n  2) and two projective (complex) cp (1) coordinates, 
and , and constrain it by four linear dierential equations in n=2 superspace,

g  (d1

 + d2

)g = 0 ,  


g  (d1

 + d2





)g = 0 .

(b.1)

it is straightforward to verify that a general solution to eq. (b.1) reads

g = g(qa(); ) ,

 =  , q(n)()  i1    inli1in ,

i  (1, ) ,

(b.2)

in terms of an arbitrary function g(qa; ). of course, in deriving eq. (b.2) we have
used the dening constraints (2.29).

since the function g does not depend upon a half of the grassmann coordinates
of n=2 superspace by its denition (b.1), its integration over the rest of the n=2
superspace coordinates is invariant under n=2 supersymmetry. this leads to the
following n=2 invariant action [17, 18]:

s[la] =z d4x

1

2iic

d (1 + 2)4f 2e 2g(qa, ) + h.c. ,

43

(b.3)

where we have introduced the new superspace derivatives,

f   d1

  d2
 ,

e 
  d

1



  d

2
 ,



(b.4)

in the directions orthogonal to the vanishing directions dened by eq. (b.1). the
integration contour c in the complex -plane is supposed to make the action (b.3)
non-trivial. the points  = i, where the linear independence of the derivatives
(b.1) and (b.4) breaks down, should be outside of the contour c.

the form of the pss action (b.3) is universal in the sense that it applies to
any set of the projecive multiplets l(n) entering the action via the corresponding
function q(n)() dened by eq. (b.2), while the whole action is governed by a single
holomorphic potential g. this construction is easily generalizable to the case of the
so-called relaxed hypermultiplets. for example, in the case of the relaxed howe-stelle-
townsend hypermultiplet dened by the n=2 superspace constraints [58]

d(i

 ljk) = dllijkl , d(i

 ljklm) = 0 ,

and their conjugates, one should merely substitute q(2) by [15]

q(2),rel. = q(2) 

5
4

q(4)



.

(b.5)

(b.6)

some comments are in order. in the odd case of n = 2p + 1, the conjugated super-
elds li1in may enter the action (b.3) via the corresponding polynomial q(2p+1)().
however, this makes the potential g to be nonholomorphic, so that we exclude those
superels from our consideration. the factor (1 + 2)4 in the action (b.3) was intro-
duced to simplify the transformation properties of the integrand under the su(2)r
automorphisms of the n=2 supersymmetry algebra, as well as the corresponding
expressions in n=1 superspace (see below).

it is worth mentioning that the pss construction above is not invariant under the

su(2)r rotations. the cp (1) variable  has the rational transformation law,

 =

a  b
a + b

,

(b.7)

whose complex su(2)r transformation parameters (a, b) are constrained by the con-
dition |a|2 + |b|2 = 1. nevertheless, the n=2 supersymmetric action (b.3) is going to
be su(2)r invariant too, provided that the function g transforms as

g(q, ) =

1

(a + b)2 g(q, )

44

(b.8)

under the projective transformations (b.7), modulo an additive total derivative. since
we have

q

(n)() =

(a + b)n q(n)() ,

1

(b.9)

eq. (b.8) put the severe condition on a choice of g because of n  2. the su(2)r
invariant pss lagrangian should thus be linear in q2 outside of the origin of the
complex -plane (in fact, up to possible logarithmic factors), whereas in the case of
an o(4) tensor multiplet (n = 4), the pss lagrangian should be proportional to
q4.

the invariant action (b.3) of n=2 tensor multiplets (n = 2) can be easily rewritten

to n=1 superspace [17]. we nd q(2) =   ig + 2  and

s =z d4xd4

1

2iic

d2 g(  ig + 2 , ) + h.c. ,

(b.10)

in terms of the n=1 complex chiral supereld  = l11| and the n=1 real linear
supereld g = l12|, where | denotes the (2, 1)-independent part of a supereld or
an operator. the n=1 multiplets  and g together constitute an n=2 tensor multiplet

in 4d. the n=1 superspace covariant derivatives are given by d = d2| and d = d1(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12),

whereas the n=1 superelds  and g satisfy the constraints

and

d



 = d  = 0 ,

d 


d



g = ddg = 0 ,

(b.11)

(b.12)

respectively. the legendre (duality) transform in n=1 superspace allows one [17]
to trade the n=1 linear supereld g for yet another n=1 chiral supereld  (cf.
eq. (b.26) and the discussion below). when being applied to the action (b.10), it
yields the dual nlsm action

s =z d4xd4 k( + , , ) ,

whose hyper-kahler nlsm metric has a kahler potential

k =(cid:20) 1

2iic

d2g(  ih + 2, ) + h.c.(cid:21) + ( + )h ,

where the function h(, ,  + ) is a solution to the algebraic equation

as a simple illustration, lets take g(q, ) = f (q)/, in terms of a holomorphic
function f (qa) of some number (a) of n=2 tensor multiplets, with the contour c

the n=1 superspace legendre transform eliminates all the n=1 linear superelds
h a in favor of the n=1 chiral superelds a according to the algebraic equation

whose solution is

h a = gab(, )(a + a) ,

eq. (b.16) yields a kahler potential in n=1 superspace,

k(, , , ) = k(, ) + 1

2gab(, )(a + a)(b + b) .

(b.21)

by construction, the kahler potential (b.21) is parametrized by the holomorphic
potential f (), while it yields a hyper-kahler nlsm metric because of (on-shell) n=2
suspersymmetry. in the context of the c-map (sect. 1), the n=1 chiral superelds 
can be interpreted as the co-vectors associated with the dual special kahler manifold
[59].

it is straightforward to reduce the n=2 pss self-interaction of other projective
multiplets with n > 2 in eq. (b.3) to n=1 superspace. for example, the components
of the projective o(4) supereld lijkl dened by the constraints (2.29) and (2.30) are
given by

that reduces the number of the independent bosonic degrees of freedom on-shell.
indeed, the scalars lijkl comprise ve real bosonic components, while eq. (b.23)
reduces their number by one, in agreement with the known fact that the dimension
of a hyper-kahler manifold is always multiple to four.

the n=1 superspace reformulation of the interacting theory (b.3) in terms of
the projective o(4) multiplet is obtained after a decomposition of the n=2 extended
supereld lijkl in terms of its n=1 supereld constituents,

(b.24)

l1111(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) =  , l2222(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) =  ,

4 l1112(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = w ,

6 l1122(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = v ,

where  is the n=1 complex chiral supereld satisfying the constraints (2.1), w is
the n=1 complex linear supereld, d 
w = 0, and v is the general n=1 real scalar

supereld. it gives rise to the n=1 superspace action [15]

(b.25)

the n=1 complex linear multiplet w is dual to an n=1 chiral multiplet , while it
can be made manifest after introducing the n=1 chiral lagrange multiplier  into
the action (b.25). this yields the master action

s = s1 +z d4xd4 (cid:16)w + jw(cid:17) ,

(b.26)

where w is now the general complex scalar n=1 supereld. varying eq. (b.26) with
respect to  yields back the constraint on w and the action s1. varying eq. (b.26)
with respect to w instead (i.e. performing the legendre transform) yields an algebraic
equation on w , which can (at least, in principle) be solved in terms of the other
superelds. after being substituted back into the action (b.26), it results in the dual
n=1 supersymmetric action

sdual =z d4xd4 k(, , , ; v ) ,

(b.27)

with certain function k. the general supereld v can now be determined from
eq. (b.27), by the use of its algebraic equation of motion. substituting the result
back into eq. (b.27) yields the n=2 nlsm hyper-kahler potential kh.k.(, ; , )
that is only dependent upon the n=1 chiral superelds and their conjugates.

as the simplest example, lets consider a free theory dened by

(b.28)

with the contour c encircling the origin in complex -plane. the corresponding n=1

while its dual chiral (on-shell equivalent) action is given by

s1 =z d4xd4 (cid:16)  w w + v 2(cid:17) ,
sdual =z d4xd4 (cid:16) + (cid:17) .

unfortunately, dualizing the complex linear superelds w a in favor of n=1 chiral
superelds by the use of the n=1 supereld legendre transform in the general case
of eq. (b.34) does not seem to allow any simple solution.

appendix c: n=2 harmonic superspace (hss)

in the hss approach [19] one adds harmonics (or twistors) ui parametrizing the
riemann sphere s2  su(2)/u(1) and satisfying the relations

u+iu

i = 1 ,

u+iu+

i = uiu

i = 0 ,

ui+ = u

then one can make manifest the hidden analyticity structure of the standard n=2
superspace constraints (subsect. 2.2) dening both n=2 vector multiplets and fayet-
sohnius hypermultipets, and nd their manifestly n=2 supersymmetric solutions
in terms of unconstrained (analytic) n=2 superelds, while preserving the su(2)r
(linearly realized) symmetry.

instead of using an explicit parametrization of the sphere s2, it is more convenient
to deal with the (equivariant) functions of the harmonics, which carry a denite u(1)
charge dened by u(u

z du = 1 and

i ) = 1. the simple harmonic integration rules,
z du u+(i1    u+imuj1    ujn) = 0 , otherwise ,

(c.2)

are similar to the (berezin) integration rules in superspace. it is obvious that any
harmonic integral over a u(1)-charged quantity vanishes.

the usual complex conjugation does not preserve analyticity (see below). how-
ever, it does, after being combined with another (star) conjugation that only acts on


u
u(1) indices as (u+
i = ui. the
harmonic covariant derivatives preserving the dening equations (c.1) are given by

i ) = u+

ui= u

i and (u

it is easy to check that they satisfy an su(2) algebra and commute with the standard

(c.6)

analytic = ++  2i+ + ,
d++

it preserves analyticity, and it allows one to integrate by parts. in what follows we
omit the explicit reference to the analytic basis, in order to simplify our notation.

it is the advantage of hss that both an o-shell n=2 vector multiplet and an o-
shell hypermultiplet can be introduced there on equal footing. for example, the fayet-
sohnius hypermultiplet is naturally described in hss by an unconstrained complex
analytic supereld q+ of u(1) charge (+1). an n=2 vector multiplet in hss is
described by an unconstrained analytic gauge supereld v ++ of u(1) charge (+2).
the hss supered v ++ is real with respect to the analyticity preserving conjugation,
v ++ 
= v ++, while it can be naturally introduced as a connection to the harmonic
derivative d++.

an n=2 manifestly supersymmetric free hypermultiplet hss action reads 5

(c.7)

where we have introduced the notation q+
minimal coupling to an abelian n=2 gauge supereld v ++ reads

a = (


q +, q+), qa+ = abq+

b and a = 1, 2. its

s[q, v ] = z d (4)du


q +(d++ + iv ++)q+ .

(c.8)

both actions are also manifestly invariant under the su(2)r automorphisms, just be-
cause of the absence of explicit dependence of the hss lagrangian upon harmonics.
the action (c.7), in fact, possesses the extra su(2)pg internal symmetry rotating
the doublet q+
a , whereas this symmetry is apparently broken in eq. (c.8) to its u(1)
subgroup. the massless hss action (c.7) is actually invariant under the full n=2
superconformal symmetry isomorphic to su(2, 2|2) that also leaves the analytic sub-
space invariant. the supergroup su(2, 2|2) contains yet another su(2)conf. that can
be identied on-shell with su(2)r.

a hypermultiplet (bps) mass can only come from central charges in n=2 super-
symmetry algebra. the most natural way to introduce central charges (z, z) is to
identify them with spontaneously broken u(1)r generators of dimensional reduction
from six dimensions via the scherk-schwarz mechanism [22]. after being rewritten

5our superelds are all dimensionless, whereas the constant  in front of our actions has dimension

of length. we set  = 1 for notational simplicity.

50

to six dimensions and then compactied down to four dimensions, the harmonic
derivative (c.6) receives the additional connection term in 4d,

d++ = d++ + v++ , where

v++ = i(++) z + i(+ +)z .

(c.9)

the n=2 central charges can, therefore, be equivalently treated as the abelian n=2
vector supereld background with the covariantly constant n=2 gauge supereld
strength hwi = z. the non-vanishing n=2 central charges break the rigid u(1)r
i, of a massless n=2 supersymmetric eld
symmetry, i
theory. this symmetry breaking results in the appearance of anomalous terms in the
n=2 gauge leea [1], and in the hypermultiplet leea as well [22].

the general procedure of getting the component nlsm metric from a selnter-

acting hypermultiplet action in hss has the following steps:

 expand the equations of motion in grassmann variables, and ignore all the

fermionic eld components,

 solve the kinematical dierential equations (on the sphere s2  su(2)/u(1))
for the auxiliary eld components, thus eliminating the innite tower of them
in the harmonic expansion of the hypermultiplet hss superelds,

 substitute the solution back into the original hypermultiplet action in hss, and

integrate over all the anticommuting and harmonic coordinates.

this most straightforward calculation is very dicult in practice. nevertheless, in
was actually done in some special cases of the n=2 nlsm in hss, including the ones
with the four-dimensional taub-nut [36], eguchi-hanson [60] and gibbons-hawking
(multi-centre) [61] metrics.

for example, in the taub-nut case, the corresponding hss hypermultiplet action

reads [36, 22]

staubnut[q] = z d (4)du"q+d++q+ +

(q+)2(q+)2# .

the hss equations of motion for the analytic supereld q+(, u) are given by

d++q+ + (q+q+)q+ = 0 ,

where the analytic harmonic derivative d++ is

d++ = ++  2i+m +m + i(+)2 z + i(+)2z .

m(xa, u) + ++m (xa, u)

+ + +n (xa, u) + ++ + +p (3)(xa, u) .

(c.13)

the kinematical equations of motion in the (x

analytic, u) space, in the presence of

central charges, are given by [22]

m =2mf +  ( f +f +)a

++f + =  ( f +f +)f + ,

further examples can be found in refs. [60, 61]. the non-vanishing central charges in

dynamical generation of a scalar potential, e.g. in the eguchi-hanson case [25].

appendix d: bps monopoles in the su (2) yang-

v () =  tr(2  v2)2 .

(d.3)

a non-vanishing expectaion value, hi = v, of the higgs eld breaks the gauge
symmetry su(2) down to u(1). the ymh equations of motion are known to admit
the solitonic solutions given by eld congurations of nite energy, with the boundary
condition 2  v2 at the special innity s2 [63]. the (gauge-inequivalent) solitonic
solutions form the nite-dimensional space labelled by integral topological charge n
belonging to the homotopy group 2[su(2)/u(1)] = 2[s2] = 1[u(1)] = z, which is
simply related to the magnetic charge gmagnetic = 4n/e.

6the notation in this appendix may dier from the one used in the rest of the paper.

the most fundamental classical solution, corresponding to the static (thooft-
polyakov) monopole of unit magnetic charge (n = 1), is usually written down in the
spherically-symmetric form (a = 1, 2, 3)

where r is the unit radial vector, while the functions u(r) and h(r) are supposed to
satisfy the boundary conditions, u(0) = 1, u() = 0, h(0) = 0 and h() = v, in
order to avoid singularities and have a nite energy. in the so-called bogomolnyi-
prasad-sommerfeld (bps) limit [64], dened by sending   0 while maintaining all
the boundary conditions, one nds

(d.5)

(d.6)

a fundamental (thooft-polyakov) monopole has four collective coordinates, called
moduli. they comprise three translational components, dening a spacial position of
the monopole, and one angular component, describing the monopole orientation with
respect to the unbroken u(1) gauge group and associated with electric charge of the
monopole. the fundamental monopole moduli space is thus given by a non-trivial
bundle m1 = r3  s1, while it must also be hyper-kahler [12]. the only candidate
hyper-kahler metric on m1 is given by the taub-nut metric, just because of its
isometries and regularity.

the bps solitons with higher magnetic charge, n > 1, can be understood (in
asymptotic regions) as being composed of n fundamental monopoles. in other words,
the multi-monopole states should not be considered as the new states in quantum
theory, but they should rather be interpreted as multi-particle states [48]. the multi-
monopole moduli space is also hyper-kahler of real dimension 4n [12]. the spacial
coordinates, describing the center-of-mass of a charge-n monopole conguration, can
always be introduced to factorize the associated r3 factor in the corresponding moduli
space mn. the total charge conservation. associated with the (unbroken) rigid u(1)
rotations, further implies the presence of an s1 factor in mn. 7 the su(2)based
charge-n monopole moduli space mn is, therefore, of the form [12]

(d.7)

7in the case of higher gauge groups of rank r > 1, the total charge may no longer be periodic,

which implies the r1 factor instead of s1 in the decomposition (d.7) [13].

mn = r3  s1  fm n/n ,

54

eq. (d.7) is necessary to get the right spectrum of quantized charges [12].

where fm n/n is called the centered multi-monopole moduli space of real dimension
4(n  1), while n stands for a discrete subgroup of its isometry group. the n-cover
fm n of the centered moduli space is a hyper-kahler manifold. its modding by n in
a hyper-kahler metric on the manifold fm n is also supposed to be regular and

complete. in the case of a charge-2 monopole (or, equivalently, two identical funda-
mental monopoles), the centered moduli space has real dimension four, and possess
a rotational isometry so(3), which allows one to identify it with the atiyah-hitchin
manifold [12].
