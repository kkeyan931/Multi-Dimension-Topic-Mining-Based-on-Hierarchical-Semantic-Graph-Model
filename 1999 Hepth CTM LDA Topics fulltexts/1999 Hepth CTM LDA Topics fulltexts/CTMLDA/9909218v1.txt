1 introduction

in the context of n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theories in four-dimensional
spacetime, bps magnetic monopoles are referred to as 1/2-bps states, because they are
invariant under half of the supersymmetry. recently, 1/4-bps states have also been con-
sidered. 1/4-bps states are invariant under only a quarter of the supersymmetry and form
somewhat larger supermultiplets.

generally, there are six scalar elds in n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory. for
a conguration to be 1/4 bps, all but two of these scalar elds must vanish and the
remaining two must satisfy two eld equations called bps equations. the rst of these
equations requires that the gauge elds ai and one of the scalar elds, b, must satisfy the
usual bogomolny equation for bps monopoles. the second bps equation requires that
the other scalar eld, a, must satisfy the covariant laplace equation in the background of
the solution, ai and b, of the rst bps equation.

a point in the moduli space of 1/2-bps congurations corresponds to a unique 1/4-
bps conguration; the eld a is determined uniquely. this means the contribution of
a to the mass of the 1/4-bps state is a potential function over the moduli space. the
contribution of a to the mass is referred to as the electric part of the mass, or simply,
the electric mass. it is thought that there may be a moduli space approximation to the
low energy dynamics of 1/4-bps states with kinetic term given by the usual moduli space
metric and with potential term given by half the electric mass.

it is dicult to solve the two bps equations. the most tractable approach is to employ
the nahm formulation. using the nahm formulation, the elds were found for a simple case
in [1]. another approach is to study spherically symmetric solutions and use a spherical
ansatz to solve the eld equations [2, 3].

however, past experience has shown that a great deal can be learned about 1/2-bps
congurations, without knowing the explicit elds. it appears that this is also the case
with 1/4-bps congurations. the solutions of the rst bps equations are described by
moduli space coordinates and there is a natural metric on the moduli space. in a number
of examples, this metric is known even though the elds are not. furthermore, the electric
charge and the electric part of the bps energy can be obtained from the moduli space
metric without solving the bps equations for the elds [4].

in this paper, we show that the electric mass may also be calculated directly from the
nahm data, without having to calculate either the elds or the metric. we apply this to
two su(3) examples. in the rst example, b is a (1, 1)-monopole. in this case, the electric
mass is already know from more direct calculations [1, 4]. in the second example, the b
eld is the (2, [1])-monopole considered by dancer [5, 6]. the electric mass has not been
previously calculated for this case and, so, it is discussed in some detail.

a (2, [1])-monopole is a monopole in the theory with su(3) symmetry broken to u(2)
by the asymptotic value of b. in other words, su(3) has two simple roots,  and , and
the asymptotic value of b is perpendicular to , permitting a u(2) of gauge inequivalent
large gauge transformations of the elds. this means that the theory has two types of
monopoles: massive  monopoles and massless  monopoles. the nonabelian case is

2

usefully thought of as a limit of the generic case, where the asymptotic value of b is not
perpendicular to either root [7].

a (2, [1])-monopole is composed of two  monopoles and one  monopole. the moduli
space of (2, [1])-monopoles describes the solutions of the rst bps equation. the net
magnetic charge is purely abelian and the massless  monopole forms a nonabelian cloud
surrounding the two massive  monopoles. however, this discussion refers only to the
contribution that b makes to the mass. the asymptotic value of the second higgs eld, a,
breaks the symmetry further to u(1)  u(1). this symmetry breaking pattern is required
for genuine 1/4-bps congurations. when the asymptotic values of the two higgs elds
are proportional, the higgs elds are proportional everywhere. this means that there is
really only one active scalar eld and the conguration is 1/2 bps. in a genuine 1/4-bps
conguration, the  monopole is not massless if the contribution of the a eld is included.
a similar situation arose in the (1, [1], 1) case recently considered by one of us (kl) [8].
here, the su(4) symmetry is broken to u(1)  su(2)  u(1) by the b eld and is broken
maximally by the a eld. due to the recent progress in the understanding of 1/4-bps
congurations, some remarks can now be made about the (2, [1]) case which also apply to
the (1, [1], 1) case. it is emphasized that the precise position of the massless  monopole is
important in the 1/4-bps conguration. as far as the eld b is concerned, the position of
the massless monopole can be transformed by the unbroken symmetry. in fact, if a massless
monopole is considered as the massless limit; then some of the moduli of the monopole
become, in the limit, parameters of the orbit of the unbroken symmetry. on the other
hand, the asymptotic a eld breaks the su(2) symmetry and so the solution depends on
the position of the massless monopole. similarly, if there were several identical massless
monopoles, the solution of the second bps equation would depend on the moduli of the
massless monopoles.

recently, a low energy eective lagrangian for the moduli dynamics of 1/4-bps cong-
urations has been found [9]. it consists of a kinetic part and a potential part. the kinetic
part is given by the moduli space metric of the corresponding 1/2-bps monopole. the
potential part is given by half of the electric mass. the non-relativistic lagrangian has a
bps bound, and the bps conguration saturating this bound turns out to be the 1/4-bps
eld theoretic conguration. naive criteria, for specifying the valid region of this low en-
ergy lagrangian, require that the kinetic energy and the potential energy are much smaller
than the rest mass of the monopoles involved. when massless monopoles are involved, it
is not clear whether there is any valid region. however, if such a region exists, it would
have to be one where the energy is smaller than the magnetic mass of the conguration.
in this paper, we assume that a valid region exists and we explore the consequences. the
picture which emerges appears to be consistent.

the potential in the (2, [1]) case is quite interesting. it is repulsive and the relative
electric charge between dyons generates an eective attractive force. there is a minimum
allowed electric charge, which matches nicely with the string picture. the balance of the
attractive electric force and the repulsive force leads to the bps congurations. moreover,
when we try to remove the apparently massless  monopole away from the  monopoles,
it turns out that the potential grows linearly with distance from the two  monopoles to

3

the  monopole. this is a sort of connement. of course, it would be strange if we could
take out the massless monopole with a nite energy cost since it would then appear to be
both massive and massless.

in section 2, there is a review of the physics of 1/4-bps congurations. in section 3,
we discuss 1/4-bps congurations in the nahm formulation and derive a formula for the
electric mass. this formula is used to calculate the known electric mass potential in the
(1, 1) case. in section 4, the formula is used to calculate the mass of 1/4-bps states in
the (2, [1]) case. a string conguration equivalent to this state is proposed. finally, we
conclude with some remarks in section 5.

2 1/4-bps congurations

a n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory has a six component scalar eld. four of
these components are zero in 1/4-bps congurations [1] and it is possible to choose two
independent orthogonal higgs elds a and b satisfying

and

bi = dib

didia = [b, [b, a]]

(2.1)

(2.2)

where the coupling constant, e, is set to one.
in this context, these are referred to as
the rst and second bps equations. the gauge group is su(n). thus, ai and b satisfy
the usual bogomolny equation for 1/2-bps monopoles and a satises a covariant laplace
equation in the background of ai and b. the equation satised by a is the same as the
equation satised by a large gauge transformation of ai and b obeying the background
gauge condition. the appearance of the bogomolny equation apparently reects the fact
that some of the supersymmetry is unbroken. there is no bogomolny equation in the
non-bps case, where three of the scalar elds are active [3].

a general conguration has both magnetic and electric charges. asymptotically, the

higgs eld lies in the gauge orbit of

b  b  h 
a  a  h 

1

4r
1

4r

g  h,
q  h,

(2.3)

(2.4)

where the dot product of bold quantities is in the cartan space. the mass of the corre-
sponding conguration is

(2.5)
thus, there are two contributions to the mass: b g and a  q. these are referred to as the
magnetic mass and the electric mass respectively.
the solutions of the rst bps equation, (2.1), are 1/2-bps monopoles. generally, the
asymptotic value, b, of b breaks su(n) to u(1)n 1 and there exists a unique set of simple

b  g + a  q

4

roots 1, 2, . . . , n 1 such that i  b > 0 for i = 1 . . . n  1. for each simple root, there
is a fundamental monopole with four zero modes. for any magnetic charge

g = g(k11 + k22 + ... + kn 1n 1)

(2.6)

with non-negative ki, there exists a family of 1/2-bps solutions of the rst bps equation,
called (k1, k2, . . . , kn 1)-monopoles [10]. usually g = 4. the solutions are uniquely char-
acterized by their moduli space coordinates. thus, any specic solution of the rst bps
equation is given by the coordinates zp of the moduli space of these 1/2-bps monopoles.
the dimension of the moduli space is 4 (k1 + k2 + ... + kn 1) and there exists a naturally
dened metric on this moduli space, given by the l2 norm of gauge-orthogonal eld vari-
ations. the magnetic mass is the same for all monopoles with the same magnetic charge
and is given by

kii

(2.7)

b  g = gxi

where gi is the mass of the ith type of monopole.

the symmetry breaking is not maximal when i  b = 0 for some i. the corresponding
fundamental monopole becomes massless and does not exist in isolation. however, when
the total magnetic charge g is purely abelian, so that g  i = 0 for i  b = 0, there
are massless monopoles with ki = (ki+1 + ki1)/2. these massless monopoles appear as a
nonabelian cloud surrounding the massive monopoles. as long as the total magnetic charge
remains purely abelian the dimension of the moduli space does not change in the massless
limit [10, 7]. however, the meaning of the moduli space coordinate changes from the point
of view of 1/2-bps congurations. the position and phase of massless monopoles become
the unbroken nonabelian gauge orbit parameters and gauge invariant cloud parameters.

a solution of the second bps equation can be found for each solution of the rst bps
equation.
in fact, the second bps equation is identical to the zero mode equation for
gauge-orthogonal large gauge transformations of the elds. there are n  1 such zero
modes since su(n) breaks into n  1 abelian u(1) groups. from the solution of the
second bps equations, the electric charges carried by the ki i monopoles can be read o
from the asymptotic eld (2.4).

thus, when the asymptotic value, b, leaves some of the nonabelian gauge symmetry
unbroken, the 1/2-bps congurations may involve massless monopoles. the asymptotic
value a may preserve the unbroken symmetry by b or break it further. when there is
an unbroken nonabelian symmetry group, there may be non-vanishing, nonabelian electric
charge for a 1/4-bps congurations. this is shown in a simple case in [8].

3 the nahm formulation

in this section, we rst review the nahm formulation for the rst bps equation.
we then derive a formula for the electric mass using the nahm formulation. there is a
complication when two adjacent charges are equal, as in the (1, 1) case. in subsection 3.1,

5

we extend our formula to these cases. the specic example of the (1, 1) case is considered
in subsection 3.2. in the next section, the formula is applied to the (2, [1]) case.

bps monopoles are classied by nahm data [11, 12]. nahm data are a 4-vector of
skewhermetian matrix functions of one variable over the subdivided interval dened by the
eigenvalues of the asymptotic higgs eld b  h. inside each subinterval, the data satisfy
the nahm equation

dti
ds

+ [t0, ti] = [tj, tk]

(3.1)

where (i j k) is a cyclic permutation of (1 2 3). each subinterval corresponds to one of the
unbroken u(1) subgroups of su(n) and the magnetic charge around that u(1) determines
the size of the nahm matrices over that subinterval. thus, a (k1, k2, . . . , kn 1)-monopole
with higgs eld at spatial innity is given by

b  h = idiag(s1, s2, . . . , sn )

(3.2)

where s1 < s2 < . . . < sn , corresponds to nahm data over the interval (s1, sn ). over
(s1, s2), the nahm matrices are k1  k1, over (s2, s3) they are k2  k2 and so on. it is useful
to illustrate nahm data with a graph, taking the value ki over the ith interval.
boundary conditions relate the nahm matrices in abutting subintervals. for

k1






k2


s0

(3.3)

the nahm matrices are k1  k1 matrices if s < s0 and k2  k2 matrices if s > s0. the
boundary condition requires that

ti(s0) = blockdiag (ri/(s  s0), ti(s0+))

(3.4)

where the (k1  k2)  (k1  k2) residue matrices ri must form the (k1  k2)-dimensional
irreducible representation of su(2). thus, part of the data carries through the junction and
the rest has a pole with residues of a particular type.

the boundary conditions are dierent when k1 = k2. in this case the data carrying

though may have a rank one discontinuity. thus, for

k





s0

the boundary condition at s = s0 is

ti = ti(s0+)  ti(s0) =

i
2

trace2 iww

6

(3.5)

(3.6)

where w is a 2  k matrix, ww is a tensor product over both indices and trace2 () sums
the diagonal of the 2 2 part of the product. w is often called the jump or matching data.
the boundary condition is sometimes included in the nahm equation as a source term

dti
ds

+ [t0, ti] = [tj, tk] +

i
2

trace2 iww(s  s0).

(3.7)

this practice is not adopted here.

the boundary conditions for non-maximal symmetry breaking can be derived from

those above by identifying eigenvalues.

there is a group action on nahm data given by

t0  gt0g1 
ti  gtig1

dg
ds

g1,

(3.8)

where g is a group valued function of s. for this to act on nahm data, g must satisfy
certain boundary conditions on the subintervals. depending on how strong the boundary
conditions satised are, g is a large or small gauge transformation. the moduli space
of nahm data is dened relative to small gauge transformations. the precise form of
boundary conditions on the group transformations and the criterion distinguishing large
and small gauge transformations of the nahm data are discussed for specic examples in
[5, 13].

in [1], the nahm formulation of 1/4-bps states is derived by applying the fourier
analysis methods of [14] to the adhm formulation of the laplace equation for an instanton
background [15]. by partially performing the adhmn construction a  q is calculated for
(1, 1)-monopoles. a technique is now presented which simplies the calculation of the mass
in the nahm formulation. this technique relies on the isometry between the space of nahm
data and the moduli space of monopoles. in fact, while it is believed that these spaces are
isomorphic in general, this has only been proven in specic cases [16].

in [4], an expression is derived for the mass of a 1/4-bps state as a function over the
monopole moduli space. the argument that is used there is reversed to allow us to write
the mass in terms of the solution to the covariant laplace equation on nahm data. the
electric contribution to the mass is

i(adia)

a  q = trace z d3xxi
= trace z d3x{xi

(dia)2  [a, b]2}.

(3.9)

in [4], it is noted that dia is a large gauge transformation in ai and can be written as

dia =xp

a  kppai.

7

(3.10)

in the same way,

 i[b, a] =xp

a  kppb

(3.11)

where pai and pb are the zero modes for the 1/2-bps congurations and kp are the
killing vectors for the large gauge transformations. substituting these expressions into
(3.9) and using the equation satised by a gives the tong formula

where

a  q =xp,q

gpq(a  kp)(a  kq)

gpq(z) = trace z d3x xi

paiqai + pb qb! .

(3.12)

(3.13)

this formula allows the electric mass to be calculated from the metric; it does not require
that the elds are known.

the metric can also be written in terms of nahm data:

gpq = gtrace z dsx

ptqt.

(3.14)

this expression can be substituted into the tong formula (3.12) and the derivation can be
reversed to give a formula for a  q in terms of a large gauge transformation of the nahm
data satisfying the background gauge condition. there is a factor of g in (3.14 because the
mass of a static monopole is g rather than .

an innitesimal gauge transformation h of the nahm data is given by

dh
ds  [t0, h],

t0 = 
ti = [ti, h]

and the background gauge condition is

dt0
ds

+x

[t, t] = 0.

(3.15)

(3.16)

this is derived by requiring that variations are orthogonal to small gauge transformations
of the data. thus, a gauge-orthogonal large gauge transformation, p, satises the covariant
laplace equation

[

d
ds

+ t0, [

d
ds

+ t0, p]] +xi

[ti, [ti, p] = 0.

(3.17)

this is the equation discussed in [1]: the only dierences result from the convention of
using skewhermetian rather than hermetian nahm data.

8

now, substituting

a  kppt0 = 

dp
ds  [t0, p],

a  kppti = [ti, p]

xp
xp

into (3.14) and using the covariant laplace equation (3.17) gives

a  q = gtrace z ds

d

ds(cid:20)p(cid:18)dp

ds

+ [t0, p](cid:19)(cid:21) = gtrace z ds

d

ds(cid:18)p

dp

ds(cid:19) .

(3.18)

(3.19)

this is the formula for the mass in terms of the 1/4-bps nahm data. it allows the adhmn
construction to be avoided when calculating the mass.

a diculty with using this formula is calculating what a is. in the example considered
in section 4, this is not dicult as the form of the group action on the nahm is very clear.
it is more dicult in more trivial examples, where p is proportional to the identity. in these
cases it seems the adhmn construction must be examined. the adhmn construction
for 1/4-bps states is described in [1]. in short, a linear equation, known as the adhmn
equation, is solved for a set of n complex vector functions vi(s; x1, x2, x3). b and a are
then given by

ivj ds

bij = z isv
aij = z v

i(p  12)vj ds.

(3.20)

there is a tensor product with 12 in the formula for a. this matches the tensor product
in the adhmn equation.

let us consider the trivial su(2) example. in the su(2) case, b is a k-monopole and
there is no genuine 1/4-bps state, since the only solution to the second bps equation
has a proportional to b. the only non-singular solution to the covariant laplace equation
(3.17) is

where a is a constant. by (3.20) this means

p = ais1k

a = ab.

(3.21)

(3.22)

thus a = ab, q = aa and the electric mass can be calculated both directly and by using
the formula (3.19). either way

a  q = a2gk = a2b  g.

(3.23)

9

3.1 equal adjacent charges: including the jump data

recall that in the case where there are equal adjacent charges the nahm data is

augmented by jump data. the jump data appear in the metric: the metric on the

k




s1

s2

s3

data is

gpq = gtrace z s3

s1

dsx

(ptqt) + gtrace (trace2 {pwq}w).

the metric is used to calculate the background gauge condition. under small gauge trans-
formations

imposing gauge orthogonality gives the boundary condition

w = h(s2)w.

large gauge transformations of w allow

1

t0 =

2(cid:0)trace2 ww  trace2 ww(cid:1) .
w = p(s2)w  qw

(3.24)

(3.25)

(3.26)

(3.27)

(3.28)

(3.29)

(3.30)

(3.31)

where q is a pure imaginary number. substituting this into the background gauge boundary
condition (3.27) gives

(cid:18)dp

ds

+ [t0, p](cid:19) =

1
2{p, trace2 ww}  q trace2 ww.

repeating the previous calculation with the jump data included

a  q = gtrace z ds

d

ds(cid:18)p

dp

ds(cid:19)  gtrace [trace2 (ww)(p(s2)  q)2].

substituting the boundary condition(3.29) into this formula gives

a  q = g"p(s1)

dp

ds(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)s1  p(s3)

dp

ds(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)s3

+ q(cid:18)dp

ds(cid:19)# .

thus, q plays the same role at junctions with jump data as p does at end points.

as with the 1/2-bps dyon above, to identify a the adhmn construction must be
examined. as described by nahm [11], when there are equal adjacent charges the complex
vector functions vi(s; x1, x2, x3) are supplemented with jumping data i where

vi = iw

10

(3.32)

and

bij = is2

isv

ivj ds.

(3.33)

ij +z s3

s1

standard arguments involving approximate solutions of the adhmn equation are then
used to prove [11, 12] that

in the 1/4-bps case [1],

s1

b  h = i

ij +z s3

s1

aij = q

if p  1k, then the same standard arguments prove that

q

a  h =

(3.34)

(3.35)

(3.36)

3.2 the (1, 1) su (3) dyon case

a  q for the (1, 1) su(3) dyon has been calculated twice already [1, 4] and it is

illustrative to calculate it again. the nahm data are

1

s1


s2

1



s3

2

up to a choice of origin and of spatial and group orientation, the nahm data are

(3.47)

4 the (2, [1]) dyons in su (3) gauge theory

let us apply the above formalism to the (2, [1]) case rst studied by dancer [5, 6].
the metric is known in this case and so the tong formula could be used to calculate
the electric mass, however, it is easier to use the nahm data formula we have derived. a
(2, [1])-monopole is a 1/2-bps conguration with two massive monopoles and one massless
one. the asymptotic form of the b eld is

thus, with  and  the standard su(3) simple roots, the magnetic charge is given by

g = g(2 + )

(4.2)

12

and there are two massive  monopoles and a massless  monopole. the magnetic charge
is purely abelian, because g   = 0.
is translated to the interval (0, ) and so the data are

the nahm data are over the interval (2/3, /3). in line with common practice, this

2




0

1



(4.3)

there is no boundary condition at s = .

the residual su(2) action on the monopole corresponds to gauge inequivalent large
gauge transformations of the nahm data. the gauge action is given by (3.8) with g an
su(2) valued function of s with g(0) = 12. the gauge equivalence is given by the small
gauge transformations: those with g() = 12. thus, g() parameterizes the su(2) action
of large gauge transformations. this action corresponds to the su(2) action on the elds.

the nahm equations are solved by

where

ti(s) =

are the well-known euler top functions. there is a pole at s = 0. the data must be
analytic for s  (0, ] and so d < 2k(k)/. these solutions are acted on by the su(2)
group action along with a rotational so(3) action to give an eight-dimensional moduli
space.

we now consider 1/4-bps congurations. substituting these (2, [1]) nahm data into

the covariant laplace equation gives the three lame equations

d2pi
ds2 = (f 2

j + f 2

k )pi

where (i j k) is a permutation of (1 2 3) and

i
2

ipi.

p = xi

a two-parameter family of pi solving the relevant lame equation is given by

pi(s) = ifi(s)fi(s) + ifi(s)

(4.7)

(4.8)

where

fi(s) =z s

ds
fi(s)2 .

(4.9)

for p to correspond to a 1/4-bps state it must be nite and hence 1 = 2 = 3 = 0.
this condition was also used to x the lower integration limit. p is nite for any  since
d < 2k(k)/. thus

a  q =

g

2xi

2

i (cid:0)xf 2

i + fi(cid:1)

(4.10)

where fi = fi(), fi = fi() and x = f1f2f3.

this expression needs to be normalized. p() is in the algebra of the su(2) action on

the moduli space and determines a. if

with a unit vector n, then

where

(4.12)

(4.13)

these are the same as the ci appearing in the metric[5, 17]. c1 is not normally written in
this form. however, it can be converted into it by using the integration by parts identity

f1 + f2 + f3 +

1
x

= 0.

(4.14)

we can make spatial rotations and group rotations of the nahm data. any su(2)
gauge rotation changes the position of the massless monopoles. after an su(2) gauge
transformation of the nahm data (4.4), the position of the massless position can be given
by

r = i((t1)22, (t2)22, (t3)22)

= (f1 sin  cos , f2 sin  sin , f3 cos ).

thus, the position of the massless monopole lies on an ellipsoid

x2
f 2

+

y2
f 2
2

+

z2
f 2
3

= 1.

(4.15)

(4.16)

the p(t) for this gauge transformed nahm data is simply the gauge transformed version of
the previous result. the p() generates an innitesimal u(1) transformation and so should
leave the position of the massless monopole invariant. thus,

n = (sin  cos , sin  sin , cos )

(4.17)

14

up to the sign. therefore, we see that the potential a  q depends on the position of the
massless monopole on the ellipsoid.
a is determined by p() and a  q is known. hence, the asymptotic value of the higgs

eld a is known. it is

after diagonalizing, we get the higgs expectation value

and the unbroken u(1) charge is

a = 

q =

g

2 xi

n2

(4.18)

(4.19)

(4.20)

clearly, the electric charge of the 1/4-bps conguration depends on the position of the
massless monopole.

4.1 the eld theory of the (2, [1]) example

in this subsection, we consider the behavior of the potential calculated above and
it appears that the electric mass is
we describe the physics implied by this behavior.
minimized when the massless  monopole is coincident with one of the  monopoles and
the two  monopoles are innitely separated. in the next subsection, we calculate this
minimum value using string theory.

quite a lot is known about the (2, [1])-monopole [5, 6, 18, 19, 17]. after xing the
center of mass and the overall phase, the moduli space has an isometric su(2) action
corresponding to the residual symmetry and an so(3) action corresponding to rotation.
these actions may be xed by assuming, as we did above, that ti is proportional to i and
that the top functions are ordered f 2
3 . this quotient space is two-dimensional
and is parameterized by d and k. however, since the so(3) action is not free, this quotient
space is not a manifold. a two-dimensional, totally geodesic manifold which includes the
quotient space was introduced in [18]. it is called y and is the manifold of nahm data
with ti proportional to i but with no ordering assumption.

2  f 2

y is pictured in figure 1. there are six identical regions labeled a to f. each is
identical to the quotient space but with a dierent ordering of the top functions. the
coordinates on the space are

so region b corresponds to the ordering f 2
3 . the thick boundary corresponds to
d = 2k and is a boundary of the moduli space. on the boundary between regions, two

of the top functions are equal and the corresponding monopole is axially symmetric. this
can happen in two ways: either k = 0 or k = 1. when k = 0, the (2, [1])-monopole is torus
shaped and coincident. this is referred to as the trigonometric case, because the euler top
functions are trigonometric. this is what happens, for example, on the boundary between
b and c. when k = 1, the (2, [1])-monopole may separate into two individual monopoles.
this is referred to as the hyperbolic case, because the euler top functions are hyperbolic;
for example, on the boundary between b and a:

f1(s) = f2(s) = dcosech ds
f3(s) = d coth ds.

(4.22)

in this case, the two monopoles separate along the x3-axis. when d is large, it is the
separation of the two monopoles [19, 13]. the clouds get bigger as the thick boundary is
approached and the  monopoles separate down the legs [18, 19, 17].

the expressions for the cis are quite complicated. they are plotted numerically in
figure 2. in this gure, c3 is plotted in regions a and b, c2 in c and f and c1 in d and e.
this is done because the top functions are in a dierent order in each region. therefore,
in each region, a dierent ci corresponds to each i. in figure 2, the ci plotted is the one
which corresponds to 3. the result is a continuous function c on y .

c seems to become innitely large at the boundary. it seems to increase steadily down
the cd and ef legs and decrease down the ab leg. this can be conrmed by doing an
explicit calculation with k = 1. in this case, it follows from the hyperbolic expressions that

(cosh d sinh d  d)d

(4.24)

hence, the potential takes a minimum value for minimum cloud size and maximum sep-
aration of the  monopoles. this leads to a critical electric charge which agrees with
the string theory (4.38). similar calculations conrm that c2
2 diverge as d goes to
innity.

1 and c2

this situation is similar to the (1, [1], 1) case discussed in [8]. the uncharged monopole
consists of two massive monopoles and a massless one. as described in [13], the su(2)
symmetry acts on the position and charge of the massless monopole. this action moves
the massless monopole about on the ellipsoid known as the massless cloud. if the su(2)
symmetry is broken to u(1), the massless  seems to acquire a denite position. the
electric 1/4-bps energy and the electric charge depend also on the position of the massless
monopole.

one of us (kl), working with collaborators, has recently considered the low energy
eective lagrangian for 1/4-bps dyons [9]. when the electric part of the energy, which is
always positive, is small, then the 1/4-bps congurations can be regarded as being very
close to 1/2-bps congurations. in fact, it may be regarded as being excited states of 1/2-
bps congurations. when the asymptotic value a is zero, only 1/2-bps congurations
appear and their low energy dynamics are given by the moduli space metric. when a is

17

small compared to b, the low energy eective lagrangian is shown to be

where the potential is u(z) = 1

gpq(z)(a  kp)(a  kq).

(4.25)

(4.26)

the potential appears because there are two higgs elds involved in the 1/4-bps con-
guration and the electromagnetic force does not exactly cancel the higgs force. this
eective lagrangian is of the order

(4.27)
where v is the order of velocities za and  is the order of |a|/|b|. this lagrangian is valid
when v  1 and   1. it has n  1 conserved electric charges, one for each unbroken
u(1) symmetry. there is a bps bound on this newtonian lagrangian and eld theoretic
1/4-bps congurations appear as bps congurations of this lagrangian.

l  v2, 2

when   , the electric contribution to the magnetic energy is small if the electric
charge is small. in the (2, [1]) case, the kinetic part of the low energy eective lagrangian
is the metric on the space of (2, [1]) monopoles: the dancer metric [5]. the potential is

u(d, k) =

g2 2

2 xi

i n2
c2
i ,

(4.28)

that is, one half of the electric 1/4-bps energy. since we are considering only the relative
motion, there is only one conserved u(1). the position of the  monopole lies on the
ellipsoid (4.15).
in the trigonometric case k = 1, the massless monopole goes to the
innity when d approaches its maximal value /. in this limit,

(4.29)

(4.30)

and so

c2

(  d)

thus, the potential is linearly increasing with the distance from the massless monopole to
the two  monopoles. therefore, the  monopole is conned. in the hyperbolic case, with
two massive monopoles well-separated,

and

f1 = f2  0

(4.33)

(4.34)

therefore, if we try to put the  monopole at the middle of the line connecting two massive
 monopoles, then the energy increases linearly with the distance. this again implies that
the  monopole should be conned to one of the two massive  monopoles.

4.2 the string theory of the (2, [1]) example

in this subsection, we propose a string conguration corresponding to the (2, [1])-
monopole 1/4-bps state and we justify this proposal with the same sort of marginal
stability argument as applied to the (1, 1) dyon in [1].

it is believed that 1/4-bps states correspond to congurations of three-pronged strings
[20]. the string conguration given in figure 3 is a well-understood example [20, 1]. this
conguration of strings corresponds, in the eld theoretic context, to a (1, 1)-monopole
with electric charge q. the string conguration becomes unstable when the (q, 0)-string
has zero length, that is, when the string junction coincides with the d3-brane labeled (2)
in figure 3.

the tension of a (q, g)-string is pq2 + g2 and by balancing the forces at the string

junction, it is simple to calculate the angles between the strings [20, 1]. the critical angle
at which the (q, 0)-string has zero length is easily calculated from the d3-brane positions.
this means that the critical electric charge is known. in [1], the covariant laplace equation
(2.2) is solved for (1, 1)-monopoles with sucient explicitness to allow the electric charge to
be calculated. it is found that the electric charge has a maximum when the two monopoles
are innitely separated and that this charge is equal to the critical charge calculated from
the string theory. therefore, the critical charge can be calculated from either the string
theory or the eld theory.

a similar calculation is undertaken in this section. a string conguration is proposed
and the electric mass is calculated when the conguration is marginally stable. the pro-

posed string conguration is y-shaped and is shown in figure 4. the angle  can be
calculated by balancing forces at the junction and is given by

sin  =

.

(4.35)

this conguration becomes unstable if the (0, 2g)-string has zero length and the y-shape
degenerates to the v-shaped conguration illustrated in figure 5. at the onset of instability

this means that the critical electric charge is qc where

(4.36)

(4.37)

(4.38)

from the string picture it would appear that this critical value of the electric charge is a
minimum. this contrasts with the (1, 1) case, where the critical value is a maximum. the
above value of the critical charge is identical to the charge obtained from (4.20) and (4.24).
this critical value corresponds to the 1/4-bps electric charge of innitely separated two
massive monopoles, with the massless monopole on top of either massive monopole.

figure 5 might create the suspicion that at some point the y -shaped conguration has
larger energy than the -shaped conguration illustrated in figure 6. calculating the
energies allays this concern. the v-shaped conguration has energy

therefore, ev  e with equality only if  is zero or /2. of course, calculations of this sort
are an over-simplication but they provide evidence favoring the y-shaped conguration
over the -shaped one.

5 discussion

in this paper, we have derived a formula for the electric mass and applied it to two
examples. there are other examples that might also be considered. it would be simple to
extend the analysis to the (2, 1)-monopole, in which the  monopole has a magnetic mass.
in this case, the gauge orthogonality conditions require [13]

(t0)2,2(s2) = t0(s2+).

(5.1)

other examples which might be considered are the ([1], 2, [1])-monopole [21, 22, 13] or
even the special higher charge solutions discussed in [23]. it would also be interesting to

21

use the numerical adhmn construction of [24] to nd the a eld. this would reveal the
spatial distribution of the electric mass. this might be interesting in examples, like the
one considered in this paper, where there are monopoles with no magnetic mass. it would
also be instructive in examples, such as those in [23], where there are extra minima of the
higgs eld.

the dynamics of 1/4-bps states are not fully understood. in the better understood
(1, 1) example the level set of the potential lies on a group orbit. in the (2, [1]) example,
this is not the case as there are monopoles with the same electric mass which cannot be
group transformed into each other. the geodesic motion on the y space was studied by
dancer and leese [18]. it would be interesting to determine how this motion is modied
by the presence of the potential.
