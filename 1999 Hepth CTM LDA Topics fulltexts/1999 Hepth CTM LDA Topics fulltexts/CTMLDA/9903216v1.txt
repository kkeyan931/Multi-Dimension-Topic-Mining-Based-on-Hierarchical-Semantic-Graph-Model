we consider random superstrings of type iib in d-dimensional continuous space. the
discretized action is constructed from the supersymetric matrix model, which has been pro-
posed as a constructive denition of superstring theory. our action is invariant under local
n = 2 super transformations, and doesnt have any redundant fermionic degrees of freedom.

recent remarkable developments in superstring theory are mostly due to dual-
ity and the d-brane. 1) they shed light on the universal framework of the theory
as well as on its non-perturbative faces. following these discoveries, constructive
denitions of superstring were proposed, 2), 3) which provide practical prescriptions
of how to proceed beyond the perturbative limits. those theories are expressed on
the basis of matrices, and are expected to restore the string picture in the limit of
large matrix dimension, as it had been in the old matrix model. 4) once we have a
constructive denition of the theory, it is a natural step to look for a proper regu-
larization scheme in order to perform practical analysis. as we have experienced in
the course of developing qcd, lattice regularization is the most powerful method
for extending the analysis into all regions of the coupling strength. understanding
quantum gravity in terms of superstrings is commonly recognized as being essen-
tially non-perturbative. in fact, several eorts to construct superstring theory on a
lattice was tried before. 5), 6) in those studies, the green-schwarz superstring action
was discretized while maintaining the local supersymmetry. the problem concerning
those descriptions is that the local -symmetry is not explicitly fullled, and it is
expected to recover only in a suitable continuum limit. in the recent constructive
formulation of a superstring based on the type iib model, the redundant fermionic
degrees are removed by a special choice of fermionic pairs in accordance with the
local -symmetry. the action of the type iib matrix model in the schild gauge is
then expressed in the semi-classical (i.e. large matrix) limit by

in order to obtain discretized action, we perform triangulations in which we
discretized the world-sheet by equivalental triangles of side length a. the action is a

sum over the contributions from each triangle: s = phijki shijki. on each triangle,

both bosonic and fermionic elds are approximated by linear functions of the local
world-sheet coordinates. since the poisson brackets on each triangle are constant
for linearly approximated elds, and the integral of a triangle action (shijki) can be
trivially carried out; then, the discretized action is obtained as

s = sb + sf = xhijki(cid:16)shijkib + shijkif

and the symmetric pair eld is dened as: ahiji = 1
2 (ai + aj). the statistical
property of the surface generated by the discretized bosonic action was studied pre-
viously in 7), while the fermionic part was considered in 5) separately. to show the
n = 2 supersymmetry, we needed to rewrite the transformation so as to be valid in
a discretized world-sheet. straightforward discretization leads to

where we use the discretized poisson brackets (0.7). we note that the poisson brack-
ets are dened on the triangle, and also that a shift in the fermionic eld (1)hijki
is not dened on the vertex, but on the triangle. in order to prove that invariance
under n = 2 super transformations, we rst consider (2), i.e. variations which are
caused by 2 in eq. (0.9). it is easily shown that both (2)sb and (2)sf vanish, and
thus s is invariant. secondly, the variational quantities, which are caused by 1 in
eq. (0.9), are calculated by

these relations guarantee integration by parts in the discretized description for two-
dimensional no-boundary surfaces. also, we used the properties of  matrices,
i.e. ( 0 )mn are symmetric matrices and ( 0 )mn are antisymmetric matri-
ces. though the rst term of the (1)sf in eq. (0.11) is canceled out by the (1)sb,
shown in eq. (0.10), (1)s still remains, and is written as

this (1)s, however, also vanishes in the cases of d = 3, 4, 6 or 10. however, we
must pay attention to the one-to-one correspondence between the variations of the
fermionic variables on the triangles and on the vertices for the local supersymmetry.

we must check that there exist n0 independent relations among the n2 = 2(n0  )

for suciently large surfaces, where  is the euler characteristic. in order to check
how many independent relations exist among the n2 relations, we calculated numer-
ically orthonormal row vectors with n0 components by using the schmidts orthog-
onalization. for most of the large n0 congurations, there exist n0 orthonormal
vectors, and thus we conclude that there mostly exist a one-to-one correspondence
for suciently large surfaces. for small congurations with extra symmetry, i.e. a
discretized rotational symmetry, however, the number of orthonormal vectors be-
comes less than n0. because these congurations are expected to degenerate, we
will need to reconsider the symmetry factor in the numerical study.
quantization is carried out by the standard path-integral method. the measure
of g is expected to correspond to the dynamical triangulation. for the type iib
supersring, the discretized partition function with a xed number of vertices is given
by

where s(t ) is the symmetry factor of the triangulation (t ) to avoid over-counting.
it is noticed that the modes associated with the translational invariance of the ac-
tion for bosonic elds and the (2) super symmetry for fermionic variables have been
eliminated by removing integration over variables associated with the vertex, i = 0.
in the following we consider the case of a tetrahedron world-sheet, which corre-
sponds to the simplest and fundamental tree diagram. the triangulation is unique,
since a conguration with four vertices is only a
tetrahedron in our convention of not allowing tad-
poles and self-energies. by xing the vertex x0

the partition function of the tetrahedron is found to be nite for d + k  5 cases;
thus, it shows that the fermionic eects of the superstring suppress the divergence.
also, in the case of the tetrahedron, even the partition function of the bosonic string
becomes nite when d  5. we have checked numerically that the bosonic elds
diverge like random walks for d  4 cases and converge for d  5 cases.
however, this is not so simple for larger
size congurations. we, in fact, have cal-
culated numerically that the partition func-
tion of the bosonic string diverges for large
n0 in the case of d = 5. we have evaluated
the distributions of the coordination num-
ber (pn0 (q)), which are dened by

toms in the gure. also, in other d cases
we obtained the same properties. thus, we

nation number for pure gravity, 8) shown by the solid line. from this result, we can
conclude that the congurations of the bosonic string are illustrated as in fig. 3.

converge, its action becomes zero in spite of the eld values x 
i can take
random numbers. thus, even in the case of d  5, the partition function diverges
for a large system. in order to avoid these divergences, we will consider the type iib
superstrings, because it is expected that these diverges caused by the bosonic elds
are suppressed by the contribution of the fermionic elds of the superstrings.

among many models of superstrings, we have considered the type iib super-
strings. we have formulated the discretized type iib superstring action, and have
shown that this discretized action is invariant under the discretized n = 2 super
transformations.
in the green-schwarz superstring action, there is a topological
term used to impose local -symmetry for separating the extra fermionic degree
of freedom. the existence of the topological term makes it dicult to deal with
the green-schwarz superstring numerically. furthermore, in the discretized green-
schwarz supersting action, the local -symmetry available in the continuum theory
is lacking. on the other hand, the type iib superstring action has neither an extra
fermionic degree nor the topological term. this result is the most important one
reached in this study. moreover, our model is easier to handle than the discretized
green-schwarz superstring. we then calculated analytically the partition function
of the tetrahedron conguration of the world-sheet, which is the simplest model for
a superstring. the calculations have shown that the eects of the fermionic elds
suppress the divergence due to the bosonic elds, and suggest that this eects also
make the surface smooth for large systems. for further studies, we would like to
construct a quantum theory non-perturbatively for the type iib superstring by us-
ing a numerical simulation. we need to nd a useful method which can numerically
calculate the determinant caused by integrations of the fermionic coordinates for
a large system. these studies of our model are very interesting and important to
construct a superstring non-perturbatively.
