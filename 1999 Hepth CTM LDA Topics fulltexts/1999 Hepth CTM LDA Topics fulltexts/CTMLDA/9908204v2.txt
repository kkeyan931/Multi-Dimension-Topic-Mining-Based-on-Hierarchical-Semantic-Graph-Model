abstract

we study instanton-corrected renormalization group ow in the
two dimensional sigma models and four dimensional gauge theory. in
two dimensions we do that by replacing the non-linear supersymmetric
cpn1 model by the gauged linear sigma model which is in the same
universality class. we compare the moduli spaces of the instantons in
the non-linear model and that of bps eld congurations in the linear
model. we reduce the problem of matching of the parameters of the
two systems to the intersection theory on the compact moduli space
of the latter model. in four dimensions we nd that the analogue of
the linear sigma model is the gauge theory on the non-commutative
space-time. its bps moduli space is the space of torsion free sheaves.
both cases (2d and 4d) are unied by the notion of the freckled in-
stantons. we also put an end to the discussion of the nature of the
superpotentials w  log in 2d and 4d and discover the surprising
disconnectnessness of the eective target space.

1 introduction

the comparison between the two dimensional sigma models and four
dimensional gauge theories is fruitful for both subjects[39]. our paper
continues this line of the research.

motivation. our original motivation for the study is the interest
in the properties of the renormalization group ow in the four dimen-
sional gauge theories. this problem is both rich and has some chances
to be exactly soluble in the context of the n = 2 supersymmetric
gauge theories.

consider for simplicity the case of the pure su (n ) (twisted) su-
persymmetric gauge theory. the problem is formulated as follows.
let  be the complex adjoint scalar in the vector multiplet. for an
irreducible representation v of su (n ) let ov = trv  be the local
operator in the gauge theory.

it commutes with the certain supercharge q. by acting on ov
with other supercharges one can construct non-local gauge- and q-
v , i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, where the superscript i
denotes the degree of dierential form, which is being integrated over
a closed i-dimensional submanifold ci of the space-time manifold.

the problem[30] is now the following. the theory has low-energy
eective description in terms of the n = 2 theory with r  n 
1 abelian vector multiplets, whose scalars ai,
i = 1, . . . , r are the
special coordinates on the moduli space of vacua which is identied
with the base of the family of the hyperelliptic curves cu:

the parameters uk are identied with the traces of  in the represen-
tations vk = k+1cn :

uk = trvk

the problem is to nd a representative for the operators ov and
v in terms of uk and other data of the low-
energy theory. on the general grounds we expect to nd a relation
like:

o(i)

ov ; pv (u1, . . . , ur; )

(3)

where pv (u1, . . . , ur; ) is the polynomial whose value at  = 0 coin-
cides with the classical expression of the trace in the representation v

mensional generalization of the well-known quantum cohomology rings
of two dimensional supersymmetric sigma models.

scenario.

it was suggested in [37] to study the renormalization
group ow with instantons present by integrating out all fast uc-
tuating elds a l`a wilson, including the small size instantons. now
suppose we have a theory i which has instantons of all sizes, and a
theory ii which has both instantons of all sizes and some other type
of topological defects which we shall call freckles whose characteristic
size is bounded from above by some parameter . then if we inte-
grate out all the uctuations of the wavelengths smaller then  then
the remaining instantonic eld congurations in both theories i and
ii become identical  we say that the theories are in the same univer-
sality class. if for some reason the theory ii is simpler then the theory
i then we can use the correlation functions in this theory to compute
the correlation functions in the theory i. one needs to express the
couplings t() of the intermediate theory at the scale    through
the ultraviolet couplings of the theories i and ii:

t() = fi(t i

 ; ),

 ; ),
upon exclusion of t() we arrive at the relation:

t() = fii (t ii

  

(4)

t i
 = f (t ii

 ; )

(5)

below we conne ourselves with the examples of topologically twisted
supersymmetric sigma models in 2d and gauge theories in 4d. in these
cases (for t being the topological couplings, see below) we expect the
function f (; ) to be independent of  as long as  is greater then the
characteristic size  of the freckles which are specic for the model.

plan. in the present paper we start to carry out this program for
the supersymmetric cpn1 model in two dimensions and then gen-
eralize to the four dimensional gauge theory. the theories i and ii in
these cases are respectively: non-linear and gauged linear sigma model
in two dimensions, non-abelian gauge theory and (conjecturally) the
gauge theory on the non-commutative space in four dimensions. in the
case of two dimensional theory we nd a subtle nature of the eective
description of the theory ii, namely we nd that it can be described
as landau-ginzburg theory on the disconnected space. then we ob-
serve that the similar phenomenon occurs in the compactication of
the four dimensional theory down to two dimensions on a two-sphere.

2 two dimensional instantons with freck-
les

let us take for the theory i the two dimensional supersymmetric non-
linear cpn1 model. it has instantons represented by the holomor-
phic maps  :   x, where  is the worldsheet and x  cpn1
is the target space. the space m of such instantons is disconnected
and non-compact. the former property is due to the existence of the
maps of various degree d  (, x)  z and it leads to the possibility
of adding a theta term to the action. the non-compactness of m is a
serious albeit mostly computational problem.

the correlation functions of certain observables oi in the theory
are the integrals over m of certain dierential forms i. was m
compact we could change i by the exact forms without aecting
the integral over m. this is no longer possible for non-compact m.
the situation is not as innocent as one could think, since the exterior
derivative on m is the remnant of the (twisted) supersymmetry q
of the model. usually one discards the q-exact terms in the correla-
tions function when all the operators are q-closed. this operation is
dangerous when one has to regularize integrals, precisely because the
virtual boundary contributions may not vanish.

a way to compactify m is provided by the theory ii for which we
take the gauged linear sigma model with the gauge group u (1) and
n charged chiral multiplets[47].

more generally, a theory ii for the sigma model with the target
space x  cn //g is the gauged linear sigma model with n chiral
multiplets which transform in a certain representation of the gauge
group g and // denotes the symplectic quotient (the quotient of the
space of zeroes of the d-terms by the action of the gauge group g).

it turns out that the moduli space of the bps eld congurations
 (i.e. the solutions to the equation q = 0) in the gauged linear
sigma model is the compact space m which contains the space m as
an open subspace.

4

2.1 bps moduli spaces in theory i vs. that of
ii

in the case of x  cpn1 the space m = dmd looks as follows:

md = {(p0, . . . , pn1)}/ 

where pk are the degree d polynomials ( = holomorphic sections
of the line bundle o(d) over  ) which are not equal identically
zero altogether and  is the equivalence relation: (p0, . . . , pn1) 
(p0, . . . , pn1),   c. thus md  pn (d+1)1. the simplicity
of this space is misleading. the catch is that not every n -tuple of
the polynomials denes a map of p1 to x. only polynomials without
common divisors do that. inside of md there is a space md of the
polynomials without the common zeroes. unfortunately in addition
one nds a stratum md1  p1 which consist of the polynomials with
one common zero, one also nds a stratum md2  p2 of polynomials
with two common zeroes and so on, all the way down to the stratum
x  pd which consists of the polynomials of the form pk(z) = akp (z)
where p (z) is an arbitrary degree d polynomial and

(a0 : a1 : . . . : an1)

is a point in x. the common zeroes of the polynomials pk are tradi-
tionally called vortices. however we shall also call them freckles for
the reasons explained in the scenario.

in this way we arrive at the following stratication of md:

md = md  p1  md1  . . .  pd  m0

(6)

following[10] we refer to the points in md as to the quasimaps. how-
ever having in mind the four dimensional generalizations we suggest
another name: the freckled instanton.

notice that there are canonical maps gluing of the point-like in-

stantons

vl : md  pl  md+l,

which actually add vortices-freckles to a quasimap:

vl (p0(z), . . . , pn1(z)|x1, . . . , xl) = (p0(z)q(z), . . . , pn1(z)q(z)) ,
(7)

q(z) = (z  x1)(z  x2) . . . (z  xl)

2.2 great expectations: setup for the correla-
tors

a typical computation in the (twisted) supersymmetric sigma model
is the evaluation of the correlation function of the observables o(0)

 are the zero-observables corresponding to the

 where o(0)

cohomology classes of x, and o(2)

 are their two-descendants.

andr o(2)

to be specic let us take x  pn1. the cohomology ring of x
is n dimensional and is spanned by r = r, r = 0, . . . , n  1, where
  h2(x) is the kahler form. the interesting observables are the
zero-observables o(0)
r > 1.
the two-observable of 1   measures the degree of the holomorphic
map:

(8)

computes the number of the rigid holomorphic maps of  to x with the
following conditions: the xed points x1, . . . , xk on  are mapped to
the submanifolds c 1, . . . , c k  x which represent the cycles which
are poincare dual to the cohomology classes 1, . . . , k of x while
some points y1, . . . , yl whose position is not specied are mapped to
the submanifolds c 1, . . . c l  x whose homology classes are dual to
1, . . . , l.

the answer is independent of the specic choice of c , c  as long

as everything remains in generic position3.

in order to use the compactication md one has to formulate
the computation of the correlation function (8) in terms of the lin-
ear gauged sigma model, more specically, in terms of the n -tuples of
the polynomials of degree d.

3 this interpretation of the correlation function holds when one chooses the specic
representatives for the cohomology classes r of x, namely delta functions supported at
c , c . if one smoothes out the delta functions then at some point the supports of the
smeared delta functions overlap and one should use more intricate arguments to show that
the correlation function computes the same thing.

6

it is not hard to do that. the cycle in pn1 which is poincare
dual to r can be represented by a plane c  which is the space of
solutions to a system of linear equations 
i = 0, i = 1, . . . , r and each

is a section of o(1), i.e. the linear function in the homogeneous
i
coordinates w0, . . . , wn1 on x:


i (w0, . . . , wn1) =

n1x=0

l

i,w,

l

i,  c

now the correlation function in the non-linear sigma model computes
the number of such n -tuples p0, . . . , pn1 modulo the common mul-
tiple   c and the points y1, . . . , yl   which obey the following
equations:

p
i

(p0(xp), . . . , pn1(xp)) = 0,

i = 1, . . . , rp,

p = 1, . . . k (9)

q
i (p0(yq), . . . , pn1(yq)) = 0
if we relax the conditions on the polynomials pk, i.e. allow them
to have common divisors we replace the computation in the non-linear
sigma model by that in the gauged linear sigma model.

i = 1, . . . , rq ,

q = 1, . . . l

(10)

the drastic dierence between the spaces md and md shows up in
the following: if the polynomials p0, . . . , pn1 have a common zero x
then the equations (10) have solution e.g. ya = yb = yc = x for some
a 6= b 6= c. these solutions have nothing to do with the properties of
the actual holomorphic map dened by the polynomials pk with the
common factor divided out. in other words they do not contribute
to the solution of the enumerative problem posed by the non-linear
model. nevertheless they contribute to the correlation function of the
linear model.

the accurate subtraction of these extra contributions is the heart
of the relation (4) between the non-linear and the linear sigma models.
the most notorious example of this renormalization is known under
the name of the mirror map in the case of sigma models with calabi-
yau threefolds as the target space[47, 18, 34].

in case of the manifold x  pn1 (more generally if x is a d-

dimensional fano variety withrx d1  c1(x) > d) the correlations

functions of the zero-observables o(0)
 can be rather easily computed
by replacing the space md of the holomorphic maps by the space

7

md. the proof goes as follows: suppose that the ghost numbers i
of the observables o(0)
k (which coincides with the degree of
the cohomology classes of x which they represent) saturate the ghost
number anomaly in the instanton sector d, i.e.

1 , . . . , o(0)

al = n (d + 1)  1

xl

since the positions of the zero-observables x1, . . . , xk   are distinct
1 (x1) . . . o(0)
the vortices can contribute to the correlation function ho(0)
only if their location coincides with some of the points x1, . . . , xk. the
vortices with the xed location xi1, . . . , xip on  form a submanifold
vp(mdp  {xi1 , . . . , xip})  md of codimension n p. each class in
h(x) has degree which is less then n (in complex units). the com-
plement to the vortices in  is mapped to x with the degree d  p
therefore the rest of the observables must be saturated by the zero
modes which are present in the holomorphic maps of the degree d  p,
i.e. by n (d  p + 1)  1 zero modes. but their total number is

k (xk)i

xl6=i1,...,ip

l  n (d + 1)  1  p(n  1) =

= n (d  p + 1)  1 + p > n (d  p + 1)  1 = dimmdp.

hence the dimensions do not match and the vortices do not contribute.
the counting changes as soon as we start computing the correlation
functions of the two-observables. in that case the point of insertion of
the two-observable is not xed and may hit other observables at the
same time with the vortex. if the total ghost number of the collided
observables is greater then n 1 then in general there is a contribution
of the vortex to the correlation function. it is this phenomenon which
induces the contact terms4 which enter the relation (5) and provides
its microscopic explanation.

2.3 computations in theory ii: geometric story

let us compute the generating function of the correlators of the zero-
and two-observables in the gauged linear sigma model. the arguments
of the equations (9), (10) are the polynomials pk and the points yq.

4it is well-known that the contact terms correspond to the change of couplings[40].

(12)

this representation of the generating function of the correlation func-
tions in the linear gauged sigma model is rather suggestive yet shows
the crucial dierence between the non-linear and the linear gauged
models. the dierence shows up as the asymmetry between the zero-
and two-observables and the absence of the constant (in tk) metrics
on the space of zero-observables [21, 43]. the suggestive part of the

formula (12) is in its contour integral form, which looks very much like
the correlation function in the topological landau-ginzburg theory[41]
(with the contact terms[26] equal to zero). the latter must have the
following structure:

f lg

0

(t, t ) =i 2(x)dx 1  . . .  dx d exppk tkk(x)

1wt (x) . . . dwt (x)

(13)

where x i are the holomorphic coordinates on the target space x of the

lg sigma model, dwt (x) = dw0(x) +pk tkdk is the holomorphic

one-dierential (the derivative of the superpotential wt ), k are the
representatives of the local ring of the superpotential and (x)dx 1 
. . .  dx d is the holomorphic top degree form on x [41, 26, 46, 24].
the formula (12) is not exactly of the form (13) but it is easy to map
it into this form: replace the summation over d by the integral using
the poisson resummation trick:

xd0

ad = xnzz

assuming that the function ad dened on z+ can be extended to the
whole of r+ as a continious function. in order to apply this trick to
the formula above(12) we rewrite the contour integral over  as the
integral over  from 0 to 2 with  = ei. now we dene x as eix.
doing these manipulations we arrive at:

the contour integral in (15) is taken around innity at each connected
component of x . as usual the expression (15) must be understood
perturbatively in tk for k > 1.

the requirement that wt must be linear in tk constrains it but
does not xes it uniquely. we could interpret (14) in a slightly dierent

way, by taking  = ei(n/2) and wt =  1

it is not possible to make a fair choice between all these options
without further physical insight. we turn to it in the next subsection.

2.4 physical derivation

despite the exotic nature of the eective target space and the super-
potential which we derived in the previous section using topological
techniques applied to the moduli space of the bps eld congura-
tions in the gauged linear sigma model it makes perfect sense! in fact,
we shall now derive the same result using the eective eld theory
techniques.

recall the eld content of the two dimensional gauged linear n = 2

take values in some complex vector space w with the constant kahler

, f i(cid:1)
supersymmetric sigma model. the chiral multiplets i =(cid:0)i, i
form . the vector multiplets v = (cid:0)a, , , , , d(cid:1) take values

in the lie algebra of the group g which acts in w preserving kahler
structure. the supereld  which contains the eld strength f =
da+ 1
2 [a, a] is the twisted chiral supereld with the quantized highest
component f (for abelian g).

the bosonic part of the lagrangian is (in the absence of the tree

level superpotential):

z kdik2 +

e2

kk2 + k[, ]k2

(17)

iji j is the moment map for the g action in w . if the
where   t a
gauge group g contains u (1) factors then we may deform the model
by adding a constant per each u (1) to  (fayet-illiopoulos terms)
thereby promoting  to

 = t a

iji 

j  ri1i

(18)

also, for each u (1) factor there is a  term: ir fi. altogether we

get a complex parameter ti = iri + i

2 per each u (1). correlation

11

functions of chiral observables are holomorphic in ti  an important
constraint.

finally, e2 in (17) is the gauge coupling (for several u (1) factors
i ). the standard lore says that in
i   and the gauged linear model looks more and

one may have dierent couplings e2
the infrared e2
more like the non-linear sigma model with the target

x = w//g = 1(0)/g

for g = u (1), w = cn being the n times the standard charge one
representation of g the space x is isomorphic to cpn1 for r > 0,
x is a point for r = 0 and x is empty for r < 0.

the eld congurations which preserve some of the supersymmetry

obey the equations [47]:

(cid:0)  + a(cid:1) i = 0,

f = e2

(19)

it is possible to show that for the spherical worldsheet the space of

solutions to these equations in a given instanton sector (r f = 2id)

coincides with the space md of quasimaps[8]. the quasimaps with
vortices correspond to the perfectly smooth solutions of (19) which are
the generalizations of the abrikosov-nielsen-olesen vortices[1]. they
er and therefore for  > 1
have the characteristic size of the order
er
are integrated out in (4). the fact that the vortices have the nite
size in the microscopic theory ii is another justication for the name
freckle which we suggest.

1

to derive the relations (15), (16) within the physical theory one
integrates out the n chiral multiplets in the background of slowly
varying elds of the vector multiplet. one induces the well-known
twisted superpotential[14] (in our notations)

fwe () = n


2

log




(20)

with  = e2it1. the complex scalar  enters the twisted chiral
supereld  which has a constrained f component - it comes from
the gauge eld strength hence must be quantized:

z f  2iz

(21)

if this was not the case the superpotential (20) would not make any
sense due to the branching of the logarithm[47]. the bosonic part of

12

the lagrangian which contains the eective superpotential (20) has
the form:

(22)

z fwe (d + if ) + fw e (d  if )

to draw some physical conclusions from the shape of the eective
superpotential we need to map the constrained supereld  to the
unconstrained (twisted) chiral multiplet. otherwise we cannot simply
integrate out f in (22) to get an eective potential.

instead we perform the following duality transformation. first
of all we assume the worldsheet to have a spherical topology (it is
not necessary but simplies the discussion a bit). let us choose an
arbitrary point p on the worldsheet. the eld  taking values in c
(the point  = 0 is the singular point as there the matter elds become
massless and this singularity is avoided dynamically as we shall see in a
minute) is the same thing as the eld  taking values in c,  = exp i
with the only condition:

0  re (p) < 2

(23)

this condition is not holomorphic but this will not bother us, as we
will get rid of it very soon. the change of variables from  to  with
the constraint (23) maps all the elds in the supermultipet  to those
in the supermultiplet . now we can relax the condition (21) at the
expense of adding to (22) a term

2inz f

(24)

where n  z is the integer-valued eld which must be summed over
in the path integral. the term (24) is equivalent to the shift of the
twisted superpotential by the term, linear in :

fw  fw + 2in = iei(cid:0)n   n t  2n(cid:1)

now, the summation over all n  z with the path integral over 
obeying (23) is equivalent to the summation over n  zn with the
path integral over all  without any constraints, as promised. for the
shift of  by 2 is equivalent to the shift of n by n . in this way we
arrive at the formula (16) with t1 = n t, tk = 0, k > 1.

to get the full set of times tk we must start with the linear
sigma model deformed by all two-observables. it is easy to see that
this deformation is equivalent to the shift of the superpotential by the
terms  tkk, k > 1.

2.5 more examples of disconnected targets

in this subsection we consider more examples of eective theories with
disconnected target spaces. this story slightly takes us o the route so
the reader who is interested in further details concerning the relations
between the theories i and ii may skip it and proceed directly to the
next section.

compactication of n = 2 gauge theory. consider four dimen-
sional n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory with the gauge group
su (n ). let us keep the four dimensional coupling nite so that
we allow the point-like instantons to contribute to the eective ac-
tion. then the eective two-dimensional theory is given simply by the
kaluza-klein reduction of the eective four dimensional low-energy
action.

recall that the bosonic part of the latter is given by the following

expression:

sbos =z ijf i  f j  ijf +

i  f +

the couplings ij, i, j = 1, . . . , n  1 are determined with the help of
the family of hyperelliptic curves (1).

when we consider all possible congurations of the gauge eld we
must include those which have non-trivial uxes through the sphere
s2. naturally we get sectors labelled by ~n = (n1, . . . , nn1), where

fi = 2ini, ni  z

(26)

zs2

now, the resulting two dimensional theory still contains abelian gauge
elds. as it is well-known the gauge elds are non-dynamical in two
dimensions. it is perhaps less known that this non-dynamical nature
of the gauge elds can be conveniently summarized by saying that
instead of the path integral over the gauge equivalence classes of the
gauge elds one can simply take the path integral over two-forms fi
with the only constraint that the integral of fi over the (compact)
space-time is quantized[45, 7, 16]:

zspacetime

fi = 2i mi,

mi  z

this description automatically takes care of the gauge xing and the
faddeev-popov determinants. as we did in the previous analysis it

14

is convenient to enforce the latter constraint by introducing another
integer-valued eld ~m = (m1, . . . , mn1), mk  z to be summed over,
relaxing the condition on fi by allowing it to be any two-form, at the
same time adding to the action an extra term

s  s +zspacetime

mifi

(27)

let us compactify this theory on a two-sphere s2. since the sphere
has no covariantly constant spinors the supersymmetry will be bro-
ken. in order to avoid that we consider the (partially) twisted theory,
i.e. add certain curvature couplings to the lagrangian. the simplest
approach starts with the theory which is topologically twisted in four
dimensions [44, 5]. the eld content of the theory is: a vector a, a
one-form fermion , a self-dual two-form fermion , a scalar fermion
, an auxiliary self-dual bosonic two-form h, a complex bosonic scalar
a.

upon kaluza-klein reduction (which amounts to keeping the in-
ternal parts of the elds harmonic) we will get: a vector a, a one-form
fermion , a two-form fermion , a scalar fermion , an auxiliary two-
form bosonic eld h, a complex bosonic scalar a. upon the trick with
the introduction of the auxiliary labels ~m described in the previous
section the vector a is replaced by another auxiliary bosonic two-form
f . all elds have in addition a label i which runs from 1 to n  1. let
us look at the supersymmetry transformations: the scalar supercharge
q acts as follows:

qfi = di, qi = dai, qai = 0

qi = hi, qhi = 0,
qai = i, qi = 0

(28)

(29)

(30)

one can easily recognize here the q-operator of the topological type
b sigma model. usually the fermion i is denoted as i, while the
auxiliary eld hi goes under the name fi.

what is the target space? the immediate answer would be: the
space of ais, since these are the target space coordinates in the su-
persymmetry transformation laws. but we should remember that on
the route to the sigma model description we were introducing some
extra labels ~n, ~m when we dealt with uxes of the gauge eld through
the internal sphere as well as the two dimensional space-time itself.

15

the second guess would be that we should take as many copies
of the space of ais as there are labels (~n, ~m). the truth sits in be-
tween. recall that ais are only local special coordinates on the mod-
uli space v of vacua of the gauge theory. as one goes around some
non-contractible loops in v one comes back with another set of ais,
transformed by a monodromy group. this very group also transforms
the vectors (~n, ~m).

after all these symmetries are taken into account we get the fol-

lowing statement:

the target space v of the eective type b sigma model is the space
of pairs: (cu, ), where cu is one of the curves (1) and   h1(cu, z).
the unusual property of this target space is its disconnectness: the
cycles 1, 2 which are not in the same orbit of the monodromy group
belong to the dierent connected components. the component where
 = 0 is isomorphic to the moduli space v of the curves (1), while the
other components are certain covers of v:

for example, for n = 2, the component with  = 0 is isomorphic to
the complex line with the coordinate u, parameterizing the curves:

v  v ev  . . .

y2 = (x2 + u)2  44

while the other components are isomorphic to the strip 0  re  
4, im  > 0. this space shows up in certain computations in donald-
son theory [33, 29].

superpotential. the curves (1) are embedded by denition into a

hyper-kahler manifold t p1, which has a holomorphic two-form :

 =

1
2i

dx 

dz
z

(31)

our sigma model has a (twisted) superpotential w . in general,
the superpotential needs not to be well-dened. only the derivative
dw must be a well-dened holomorphic one-form on the target space.
in our case we can write a simple formula for the derivative dw :

dw =i



(32)

to prove the last assertion let us introduce a few more standard no-
tations. let  = 1
z be the meromorphic one-dierential, d = .

2i x dz

16

its residues on the curve cu vanish for any u. hence we can integrate
(32) to get:

 = niai + miad,i

(33)

w =i

where we expanded  in some (local) symplectic basis (ai, bi) in
h1(cu, z) and

ai =iai

,

ad,i =ibi



now let us compute the potential which follows from the superpoten-
tial (33):

(cid:16)ni + ikmk(cid:17)(cid:16)im1(cid:17)ij(cid:16)nj + jlml(cid:17)

(34)

this is precisely the potential which one would get from the gauge
theory action upon compactifying on the small sphere and performing
the two dimensional duality transformation. of course in this very
setup one also has kaluza-klein modes along the two-sphere which
have the same order of energy as the uctuations in the potential
(34). one can separate the two scales by adding the two-observable
to(2)
u whose support extends over all of the two dimensional space-
time. this addition changes the superpotential by tu and introduces
another scale into the problem. more details on this issue can be found
in [29].

remarks. the eect of the unfolding of the moduli space of twisted
chiral multiplets is very general.
in fact, one can use the similar
method of unfolding in four dimensional theories [22, 23] with eec-
tive superpotential of veneziano-yankielowicz type[42]. to the best
of our knowledge the phenomenon of creating of disconnected com-
ponents in the eective target space was not observed before neither
in two- nor in four-dimensional models. this phenomenon makes the
study of solitons connecting dierent vacua rather intricate. for the
solitons are represented by the paths connecting the vacua sitting on
dierent components of the target space. it means that the trajectory
connecting the vacua should break at some point. the only way this
breaking may be avoided is to assume that the metric on the eective
target space is such that the components are actually glued together
at innity.

if this is not the case then the actual location of the breaking point
on each sheet might be undetermined by means of the low energy
theory alone. this is similar to the fact that the mass of the magnetic

17

monopole cannot be computed from the maxwell theory alone. we
shall elaborate on this and related issues elsewhere [32].

notice that if the model is embedded into the string/m-theory, e.g.
via brane realization then one gets a geometrical representation of the
solitons[20]. also note that the superpotential of the sw form (but
without unfolded disconnected target space) was computed in [25] in
the geometrical engineering approach to the compactications on the
calabi-yau fourfolds. we plan to return to this question elsewhere.

2.6 comparison to the results of the xix cen-
tury

despite the success of the previous two subsections we should warn the
reader that their results where merely the groundwork for the solution
of the real problem - the eective theory description of the non-linear
sigma model. to see that the renormalization(4),(5) is non-trivial let
us perform several numerical checks.

to be specic let us take n = 3, i.e. cp2 model. the genus zero
correlation functions in the topologically twisted theory compute the
numbers of rational planar curves which pass through a given number
of points in p2 and intersect a given number of lines in generic position.
in particular:

ho(0)

1 (0)o(0)

1 (1)o(0)

2 inonlin = 1

(35)

1 ()z o(2)

2 z o(2)

is the number of degree one curves (lines) which pass through two
distinct points and intersect three lines in generic position. from the
elementary school we know that this number is equal to one. on the
other hand, it is easy to see that

ho(0)

1 (0)o(0)

1 (1)o(0)

2 ilin = 22 = 4

(36)

1 ()z o(2)

2 z o(2)

this is the rst in the series of numbers predicted by the gauged linear
sigma model which dier from those computed by the last century
algebraic geometers.

of course, the dierence happens precisely when we start looking
at the correlation functions of two-observables, as we promised in the
beginning of the section. we also said that the dierence is due to

18

the contribution of the freckles6. let us now see explicitly how this
happens.

the space m1 contains the subspace p1  p2 of vortices, where p1
parameterizes the location x of the vortex and p2 is the set of images
r in the target space of the complement to the vortex. the equations
(10),(9) are obeyed both by the proper map of degree one and by the
vortex congurations with x = y1 = y2 = xp where xp assumes one of
the three available values: 0, 1, . the two remaining equations state
that the image r must belong to two lines p, p 6= p in p2, i.e. to their
intersection point. altogether we found three vortex congurations,
each contributes one to the correlation function, hence:

4lin = 1nonlin + 3vortex

(37)

the similar (but much more tricky) counting works for higher instan-
ton charges. the eect of subtraction of the vortex contributions is
to replace the eective superpotential (16) by the innite series

(n   2n  t1) ei +xl

al(t )eiln (t1)

(38)

the computation of the coecients al(t ) is a complicated problem
[32] yet related problems are studied in the enumerative geometry
[9, 15]. if we were interested in the actual values of the correlators in
the theory i we could use the techniques of [21]. our goal is slightly
dierent.

remark. consider the trivial non-linear sigma model with the tar-
get space cp0 = a point. it becomes rather interesting once replaced
by the linear gauged sigma model. the latter has the moduli space

md = pd = symdp1

(39)

3 back to future: four dimensional in-
stantons with freckles

so far we have seen that adding some kind of point-like topological
defects  freckles  may lead to the compactication of the moduli

6we should mention that the similar eects were observed more then a hundred years

before[9] the discovery of supersymmetry[19]

19

space of instantons in a theory i: m  m. we have also seen that
these point-like defects may be perfectly smooth eld congurations in
the theory ii, but of some characteristic size . the natural question
is: can this work in four dimensions?

in four dimensions we study gauge theories with instantons. the
moduli space of instantons m is non-compact due to the well-known
phenomenon of shrinking of instantons. suppose that the euclidean
space-time is a compact kahler surface s, with kahler form .
it
is well-known that the moduli space of instantons in a given gauge
bundle e with the characteristic classes c1(e), c2(e) is isomorphic to
the moduli space of -semistable holomorphic bundles e over s with
the same chern classes as e. we recall the notion of (semi)stability
below. algebraic geometers replace the holomorphic bundle e by the
sheaf e of its holomorphic sections. more specically, over each open
set u one considers the abelian group  (e|u ) of the holomorphic sec-
tions of e over u . the elements s of this group can be multiplied by
the holomorphic functions f on u , f  ou . this operation makes
 (e|u ) a module over the ring ou of holomorphic functions in u . for
suciently small u one can nd a basis si in the space of holomorphic
sections of e|u such that every section s   (e|u ) can be uniquely
expanded as:

s =

fisi,

fi  ou

(40)

rxi=1

the sheaves with this property are called locally free  if the sheaf is
locally free then it is a sheaf of sections of some holomorphic bundle.
one can relax the condition (40) to the property of being torsion free:

if f s = 0  either f = 0 or s = 0

(41)

the sheaf which is torsion free in general does not come from a holo-
morphic bundle. nevertheless the beautiful property of the torsion free
sheaves (in complex dimension two) is that every torsion free sheaf f
is almost a bundle, in fact over a complement to a nite number of
points in s it is a bundle! one can always nd ([38], lemma 1.1.8)
a holomorphic vector bundle e such that e/f = sz , in other words
there is an exact sequence:

0  f  e  sz  0

(42)

where sz is a skyscraper sheaf supported at points, i.e. dimz = 0,

 (sz|u ) = c#zu

20

we see the rst similarity between the torsion free sheaves and
vortices in two dimensions: both dier from the honest instanton (the
face of the freckled instanton) only at nite number of points (freckles).
more quantitatively this similarity is supported by the fact that these
points carry instanton charge:

c2(f) = c2(e)  c2(sz ) = c2(e) + #z

(43)

the importance of the torsion free sheaves in the studies of s-duality
was rst advocated in [27]. one can show that the natural back-
grounds for the higher dimensional bc-systems studied in [28] are again
the sheaves [32] rather then holomorphic bundles alone.

in order for the torsion free sheaves to be useful we need a way to
construct their moduli space and make sure that it is compact. it turns
out that if one takes the space of -(semi)stable torsion free sheaves7
then the resulting space mc is compact (and even quasiprojective
[17]). moreover, it can be described rather explicitly in the case of the
manifolds s  p2, p1  p1 using adhm techniques.

to make further contact with the two dimensional story we need:
a) the supersymmetric gauge theory whose moduli space of bps elds
is mc, b) an analogue of the computation (12).

the answer to the point a) is not completely known. in the light
of [36] the natural conjecture would be to take the theory on the non-
commutative space s which is a quantization of s with the 1 being
the poisson structure.

the point b) is addressed using the monad description[6, 4, 11, 3]
of the moduli space of the torsion free sheaves (a useful review is
[35]). for example, for s = cp2 the -semistable torsion free sheaves
f arise as follows. let v0, v1, v2 be the complex vector spaces of
dimensions v0,1,2 respectively. consider the complex of bundles over
s:

0  v0  o(1) a

v1  o b

v2  o(1)  0

(44)

in down-to-earth terms this sequence has the following meaning. the
maps a, b in the homogeneous coordinates (z0 : z1 : z2) are the matrix-
valued linear functions: a(z) = za, b(z) = zb. the words com-
plex mean that
b(z)a(z) = zzba = 0  ba = 0,  = 0, 1, 2,

ba+ba = 0,  6= 

7the sheaf f is -semistable if for any subsheaf f  one hasrs  (cid:16) c1(f )

rkf   c1(f )

(45)

rkf (cid:17)  0

21

for the pair (b, a) of the maps between the sheaves obeying (45) we
can dene a sheaf f over s, whose space of sections over an open set
u is

 (f|u ) = kerb(z)/ima(z),

for

(z0 : z1 : z2)  u

the space of monads is the space mmon of triples of matrices a 
hom(v0, v1), b  hom(v1, v2) obeying (45). this space is acted on
by the group gc

mon = (gl(v0)  gl(v1)  gl(v2)) /c:

(b, a) 7 g  (b, a) = (g2bg1

1 , g1ag1

0 ), for (g0, g1, g2)  gc

(46)

the sheaves dened by the pairs (b, a) and g  (b, a) are isomorphic.
the maximal compact subgroup of gc

fix the real numbers r0, r1, r2, such that p vr = 0, r0, r2 > 0.

write the moment maps:

(48)

then the moduli space of the semistable sheaves is

mc =(cid:16)1

1 (0)  1

2 (0)  1

(49)

3 (0)(cid:17) /gmon

the compactness of the space (49) is obvious:
if we rst perform a
reduction with respect to the groups u (v0)  u (v2) then the resulting
space is the product of two grassmanians: gr(v0, 3v1)  gr(v2, 3v1)
which is already compact. the subsequent reduction does not spoil
this.

22

the chern classes of the sheaf f determined by the pair (b, a) are:

r = v1 v0 v2, c1 = (v0  v2) , c2 =

1

2(cid:16)(v2  v0)2 + v0 + v2(cid:17) (50)

let (i, i, i) denote the elements of the lie algebra of gmon, i.e.
i  u(v0), i  u(v1), i  u(v2) and (, , )  ( + 1v0, + 1v1 , +
1v2). we are interested in computing certain integrals over mc. this
can be accomplished by computing an integral over mmon with the
insertion of the delta function in i and dividing by the volume of
gmon provided that the expression we integrate is gmon-invariant:[45]

(51)
the useful fact is that the observables of the gauge theory we are
interested in are the gauge-invariant functions on (, , ) only. more
specically, there is a universal sheaf u over mc  s, whose chern
character is represented by:8

ch(u) = tre  tre  tre+

(52)

in particular (cf. (2)):

o(0)

u1 =

  o(2)

u1 = tr  tr

since the observables are expressed through , ,  only we can inte-
grate out a, b in (51) to obtain:

23

more elaborated answer to the point b) together with the explanation
of the relation of this work to the attempts of computing adhm
integrals in [12] will be presented elsewhere [32].

as a nal remark notice that the freckled instantons are present
even for the gauge group u (1), in which case the moduli space md
is the resolution of singularities of the d-th symmetric power of the
manifold s:

md = gsymds

very much like in (39).

in both cases the freckled instantons have only freckles, but no

face.
