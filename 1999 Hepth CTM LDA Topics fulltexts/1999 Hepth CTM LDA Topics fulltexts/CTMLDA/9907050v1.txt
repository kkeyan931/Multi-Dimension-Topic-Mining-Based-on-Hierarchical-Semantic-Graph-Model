abstract

the precise relationship between the arbitrary monodromy dependent 2-form appearing in the
chiral wznw symplectic form and the exchange r-matrix that governs the corresponding
poisson brackets is established. generalizing earlier results related to diagonal monodromy,
the exchange r-matrices are shown to satisfy a new dynamical generalization of the classical
modied yang-baxter equation, which is found to admit an interpretation in terms of (new)
poisson-lie groupoids. dynamical exchange r-matrices for which right multiplication yields a
classical or a poisson-lie symmetry on the chiral wznw phase space are presented explicitly.

1 introduction

since its invention fteen years ago [1], the wess-zumino-novikov-witten (wznw) model has
been the subject of many studies, and still receives considerable attention due to its central
role in two-dimensional conformal eld theory and to the richness of its structure (see e.g. [2]).
one of the fascinating aspects of the model is that in addition to its built-in ane kac-moody
symmetry it also exhibits certain quantum group properties. the quantum group properties
were originally discovered [3] in the quantized model, which raised the question to nd their
classical analogues. the intense eorts [4, 5, 6, 7] at the beginning of the decade led to the
consensus that the origin of the quantum group symmetries lies in the poisson-lie (p-l) 
gauge  symmetries of the so called chiral wznw phase space that emerges after splitting the
left- and right-moving degrees of freedom.

however, in the denition of the chiral wznw symplectic structure there appears, unavoid-
ably, a choice to be made [6], [7], and the resulting poisson brackets (pbs) have been analysed
so far only in a small subset of the possible cases. in this letter we wish to present new results
on the general case (for details, see [8]).

following [6], [7], the chiral separation of the space of classical solutions, msol, of the wznw
model based on a simple lie group g with lie algebra g can be described as follows1. msol
consists of the smooth g-valued functions g(,  ) which are 2-periodic in the space variable
 and satisfy the eld equation r(lg  g1) = 0. the general solution can be written as
g(,  ) = gl(xl)g1
r (xr), where (gl, gr) is a pair of g-valued, smooth, quasiperiodic functions
on the real line r with equal monodromies: for c = l, r one has gc(xc + 2) = gc(xc)m
with some c-independent m  g. this means that msol is the base of a principal g-bundle,
whose total space is

cm = {(gl, gr)|gl,r  c (r, g),

gl,r(x + 2) = gl,r(x)m m  g}.

(1.1)

msol has a natural symplectic structure, 

the free right-action of g on cm is given by g  p : (gl, gr) 7 (glp, grp), and the bundle
projection,  : cm  msol, operates as  : (gl, gr) 7 g = glg1
sol, whose pull-back to cm can be extended to the
chirally separated space given by cmext = ml  mr with

r . being a space of solutions,

(1.2)

mc = {gc|gc  c (r, g),

gc(x + 2) = gc(x)mc mc  g}.

in the extended space it is natural to require the two chiral factors to be completely decoupled.

and some 2-form  depending only on the monodromy of gc. more precisely, since in the
extended model the chiral factors (mc, c
chir) must be symplectic manifolds separately,
d(c

chir) = 0, one has the condition [6]

d(mc) =

tr (cid:16)m 1

c dmc  m 1

c dmc  m 1

c dmc(cid:17) ,

(1.5)

which in turn implies that the chiral monodromy matrices mc must be restricted to a domain
g  g on which there exists a smooth 2-form  satisfying (1.5).

one of the main points of [7] is that one can construct an appropriate 2-form  out of any
(suitably normalized) antisymmetric solution r  g  g of the modied classical yang-baxter
equation (ybe) in such a way that the corresponding pbs on mc are encoded by the classical
exchange algebra

group g = {p} endowed with the sklyanin bracket [9]

c{p , p} r = [p  p, r]

(1.7)

with r = r.

by using an arbitrary  in (1.3), one expects to obtain a classical exchange algebra governed
by some monodromy dependent exchange r-matrix r(m). our rst result in fact is that we
shall establish the precise relationship between  and r(m) in the general case. we will then
point out that r(m) and the r-matrix of the p-l symmetry group need not always coincide.
that is, right multiplication can be a p-l symmetry for certain non-constant exchange r-
matrices, too, which we shall give explicitly.

to place our second result into context, we recall that an alternative method of the chiral
separation is to construct the general solution of the wznw eld equation out of bloch-
waves that have diagonal monodromy matrix, given by e with   h, where h is a splitting
cartan subalgebra with basis h i. it was pointed out in [5] that the corresponding monodromy
dependent r-matrix, r(), then satises

(1.8)

this modied classical dynamical ybe appears in other contexts [10, 11, 12], too, and has been
much studied recently (see [13], [14] and references therein). in [13] a geometric interpretation
of (1.8) has been given in terms of dynamical p-l groupoids, generalizing the relationship [15]
between the (modied) classical ybe and p-l groups. as our second result, we shall show
that an arbitrary exchange r-matrix of the wznw model is a solution of another dynamical
generalization of the modied classical ybe, given by eq. (2.28) below, which also admits an
interpretation in terms of (new) p-l groupoids.

2 poisson brackets on the chiral wznw phase space

we here investigate the symplectic structure on the chiral wznw phase space mc introduced
above. the analysis is the same for both chiralities, c = l, r, and we simplify our notation by
putting mchir for mc and g, m,  for gc, mc, c, respectively. thus mchir is parametrized
by the g-valued, smooth, quasiperiodic eld g(x) satisfying the monodromy condition

g(x + 2) = g(x)m

m  g.

(2.1)

the corresponding chiral current, j(x) = g(x)g1(x)  g, is a smooth, 2-periodic function
of x. the domain in mchir that corresponds to m  g is denoted by mchir. below we show
chir dened by (1.3) is non-degenerate if g is appropriately chosen and describe the
that 
main features of the pbs associated with this symplectic form.

to use 

chir in practice we need to establish some notation for tangent vectors x[g] at
g  mchir and vector elds x over the chiral phase space. to this end we consider smooth
curves on mchir described by functions (x, t)  g satisfying

(x + 2, t) = (x, t)m(t)

m(t)  g;

(x, 0) = g(x).

(2.2)

x[g] is obtained as the velocity to the curve at t = 0, encoded by the g-valued, smooth function

(x) :=

d
dt

g1(x)(x, t)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

.

(2.3)

the monodromy properties of (x) can be derived by taking the derivative of the rst equation
in (2.2): (x + 2) = m 1(x)m, and this can be solved in terms of a g-valued, smooth,

2-periodic function, xj  eg, and a constant lie algebra element, 0, as follows:

(x) = 0 +z x

0

dy g1(y)xj(y)g(y).

(2.4)

a vector eld x on mchir is an assignment, g 7 x[g], of a vector to every point g  mchir.

thus it can be specied by the assignments g 7 0[g]  g and g 7 xj [g]  eg. using the curve

that denes x[g], x acts on a smooth function, g 7 f [g], on mchir as

x(f )[g] =

d
dt

f [gt](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

gt(x) = (x, t) .

(2.5)

note that the evaluation functions f x[g] := g(x) and f x[g] := j(x) are dierentiable with
respect to any vector eld, and their derivatives are given by

x(g(x)) = g(x)(x)

and

x(j(x)) = xj (x).

(2.6)

this claries the meaning of xj as well. it is also obvious from its denition that the mon-
odromy matrix yields a g-valued dierentiable function on mchir, g 7 m = g1(x)g(x + 2),
whose derivative is characterized by the g-valued function x(m)m 1 = m (x+2)m 1(x).
having dened vector elds, one can also introduce dierential forms as usual. we only remark
that by (2.6) evaluation 1-forms like dg(x), dj(x) or (g1dg)(x) are perfectly well-dened: e.g.
dg(x)(x) = x(g(x)) = g(x)(x).

3

the inversion of 

chir consists of the solution of the following problem: for a xed (scalar)

function f on the phase space mchir, nd the corresponding vector eld, y f , satisfying

x(f ) = 

chir(x, y f )

(2.7)

for all vector elds x. notice that y f does not necessarily exist for a given f . we say that f is
an element of the set of admissible hamiltonians, denoted as h, if the corresponding hamiltonian
vector eld, y f , exists.

to compute 

chir(x, y f ) we assume that x is parametrized by (x) and further by the
pair (0, xj(x)), while the analogous parametrization for y f is given by (x) and the pair
(0, yj (x)). furthermore we parametrize  now as

(m) =

1
2

q(m)tr(tm 1dm)  tr(tm 1dm).

(2.8)

the q, q = q, are smooth functions on the domain g  g. studying the right hand
side of (2.7) one can establish [8] the following three necessary and sucient conditions that f
must obey to guarantee that y f exists:
 there must exist a smooth g-valued function on r, af (x), and a constant lie algebra element,
af , such that for any vector eld x

x(f ) = z 2

0

dxtr(cid:16)xj (x)af (x)(cid:17) + tr (0af ).

(2.9)

this means that f  h must have an exterior derivative parametrized by the assignments
g 7 af (x)[g] and g 7 af [g]. the restriction of af (x) to x  [0, 2] and af are uniquely
determined by (2.9), and af (x) is made a unique function on r by the next requirement.
 the expression

1

haf (x), j(x)i + af 

(x)

must dene a smooth 2-periodic function on r.
 af (x) and af must be related by

af = g1(0)haf (0)  af (2)ig(0).

if these conditions are satised, then y f is uniquely determined, and is in fact given by

g1(x)y f (g(x)) = g1(x)af (x)g(x) 

1
2

af + r(m)(af ) ,

where

r(m)(af ) = tr(m)af


and the matrix r(m) is dened as the solution of an interesting linear equation. this equation
can be best described in terms of the linear operators q(m), r(m)  end(g) which are
associated with the matrices

r
 (m) = r(m)

by the rule

q(a) = tqa,

q = r

 (m), q

 (m).

in fact [8], using these operators the equation determining r(m) obtains the form:

q+(m)  r(m) = q(m)  ad (m 1)  r+(m).

(2.15)

(2.16)

notice that at the identity e  g the unique solution is r(e) = q(e). it follows by continuity
that there is a neighbourhood of e  g on which a unique solution exists and is a smooth
function of m. moreover, it is easy to see that the solution r(m) is antisymmetric, r = r.
by choosing g  g appropriately, hence we obtain by (2.16) a one-to-one correspondence
between the smooth 2-form  on g and the smooth map g  m 7 r(m)  end(g).

incidentally, it follows from (2.12) that

y f (j(x)) = haf (x), j(x)i + af 

(x),

(2.17)

which explains why (2.10) must dene an element of eg.

having obtained the conditions of existence and the general expression (2.12) for hamiltonian
vector elds, one can analyse which functions belong to h. first note that the evaluation
functions f x[g] and f x[g] fail to satisfy the rst condition, thus they are not in h. however,
their smeared out versions

f := z 2

0

dxtr(cid:16)(x)j(x)(cid:17),

f[g] := z 2

0

dxtr(cid:16)(x)g(x)(cid:17),

(2.18)

(where in dening f we use a representation  : g  gl(v ) of g with g = (g) and a
smooth test function  : r  end(v )) can be shown to belong to h, if (x) is a g-valued,
smooth, 2-periodic test function, and  satises (k)(0) = (k)(2) = 0 for every integer k  0.
the corresponding hamiltonian vector elds obtained from (2.12) satisfy

y f(g(x)) = (x)g(x), y f(j(x)) = [(x), j(x)] + (x),

y f(m) = 0,

(2.19)

and, for x  [0, 2],

af + r(m)(af).

(2.20)

eq. (2.19) shows that the f generate an innitesimal action of the loop group on the phase
space with respect to which g(x) is an ane kac-moody primary eld, and the current j(x)
transforms according to the co-adjoint action of the centrally extended loop group. the matrix
elements m 
kl of the monodromy matrix in representation  also belong to h. the action of
y m

ij(x) and on m

(2.23)

with r(m) = r
and m1 = m  1, m2 = 1  m.

 (m)t  t. the matrix r(m) appearing here is the solution of (2.16),

we now wish to interpret the above hamiltonian vector elds in terms of pbs. recall that
the pb of two smooth functions f1 and f2 on a nite dimensional smooth symplectic manifold
is dened by

{f1, f2} = y f2(f1) = y f1(f2) = (y f2, y f1),

(2.24)

where y fi is the hamiltonian vector eld associated with fi by the symplectic form . one may
formally apply the same formula in the innite dimensional case to the admissible functions
that possess a hamiltonian vector eld. however, it is then a non-trivial problem to fully
specify the set of functions that form a closed poisson algebra. setting this question aside, it
is clear from (2.19) and (2.22) that the admissible functions of j and those of m will form two
closed poisson subalgebras that centralize each other. furthermore, we may use the perfectly
well-dened expression

{f, f} := y f(f)

(2.25)

for the pb of two admissible hamiltonians of type f in eq. (2.18) to dene the (distribution
valued) pb of the evaluation functions g(x) by the equality:

{f, f} := z 2

0

z 2

0

dxdytr12(cid:16)(x)  (y){g(x) , g(y)}(cid:17) ,

(2.26)

where tr12 is the (normalized) trace over v  v and {g(x) , g(y)}ik,jl = {g
kl(y)}.
with these denitions, our explicit formula of the hamiltonian vector eld y f in (2.20) is
equivalent to the following quadratic exchange algebra type pb for the chiral eld g(x):

ij(x), g

ng(x) , g(y)o =

1

(cid:16)g(x)  g(y)(cid:17)(cid:16)r(m) +

1
2

i sign (y  x)(cid:17)

,

0 < x 6= y < 2,

(2.27)

where r(m) denotes (the appropriate representation of) the element in g  g corresponding
to the solution of eq. (2.16): r(m) = r(m)t  t. thus eq. (2.16) gives indeed the precise
relation between the 2-form  in (1.3), (2.8) and the  in general monodromy dependent 
exchange r-matrix, r(m). proceeding in the same way with the {f, m 
kl} pb as we did with
the {f, f} one, we conclude that the right hand side of (2.21) should be interpreted as the
expression of the {g

kl} pb, and similarly for (2.22).

ij(x), m 

it is clear from the foregoing discussion that the admissible hamiltonians of type f, f
and m 
kl should together generate a closed poisson algebra. although at present we cannot
fully characterize the set of elements that belong to this algebra, we wish to point out that the
jacobi identity for three functions of type f, in any poisson algebra that contains them, is
equivalent to the following equation for r(m):

[r12(m), r23(m)] + (m)t 

1 r r23(m) + cycl. perm. = 

f .

1
4

(2.28)

here f is the same as in (1.8) and the cyclic permutation is over the three tensorial factors
with r23 = r(1  t  t), t 
1 = t   1  1 and so on. furthermore, we use the components

6

of  = t   t  given by (2.23), and the left-invariant dierential operators r that act
on a function  of m by

(r)(m) :=

d
dt

(m ett)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

,

r = i r.

(2.29)

eq. (2.28) can be viewed as a dynamical generalization of the classical modied ybe, to which
it reduces if the r-matrix is a monodromy independent constant. of course, (2.28) is satised
for any r(m) that arises as a solution of (2.16) since the jacobi identity is guaranteed by
d

chir = 0.
next we describe an interesting solution of (2.28) obtained by inverting (2.16) for the r-
matrix using a particular 2-form  (2.8) as input. for this, we now note that if the monodromy
matrix m is near to e  g, then the chiral wznw eld can be uniquely parametrized as

g(x) = h(x)ex,

(2.30)

where h(x) is a g-valued, smooth, 2-periodic function and  varies in a neighbourhood of
zero in g, g  g, for which the map g   7 m = e2  g is a dieomorhism. an easy
computation gives the following formula for chir (1.4) in this parametrization of mchir:

where

0

chir(h, ) = 

1

2 z 2

0

chir(h, ) = 0

chir(h, )  0(),

dx tr (cid:16)h1dh  (h1dh)(cid:17) + dz 2

dxtr (cid:16)h1dh(cid:17) ,

0() = 

1

2 z 2

0

dx tr (cid:16)d  dexex(cid:17) .

taking into account that m = e2, it is not dicult to verify that

d0

chir = 0,

d0() =

1
6

tr (cid:16)m 1dm  m 1dm  m 1dm(cid:17) .

(2.31)

(2.32)

(2.33)

(2.34)

recalling eq. (1.5), we see that the 2-form  in (1.3) in this case can be parametrized by an
arbitrary closed 2-form  on g as

() = 0() + (),

d() = 0.

(2.35)

by (1.3) we thus have 
chir. in order to nd the exchange
r-matrix, r0, corresponding to 0, we notice that the integral dening 0 can be computed in
closed form and the linear operator, q0, corresponding by (2.15) to its matrix is given by

chir +, in particular 0

chir = 0

chir = 0

q0 =

2y + ey  ey

2(ey  1)(1  ey )

with

y := 2(ad ).

(2.36)

then from eq. (2.16) we nd the linear operator2 version, r0, of the exchange r-matrix as

r0 =

.

(2.37)

2the expressions in eqs. (2.36), (2.37), (2.41) are dened by the power series expansions of the corresponding

complex analytic functions around zero. for instance [16], 2r0 =p

k=1

22k|b2k|

(2k)!

by means of (2.27) this r-matrix denes one of the possible monodromy dependent exchange
algebras for the chiral wzwn eld, and it also represents a non-trivial special solution of
(2.28). to uncover a remarkable property of this solution, we note that the function f (h, ) =
 = tr (t) belongs to h, and its hamiltonian vector eld in the  = 0 case gives rise to the
pbs:

{g(x), } = g(x)t


and {, } = f 
(2.38)

chir the  (essentially the logarithm
this means that in the case of the symplectic form 0
of the monodromy matrix) generate a classical g-symmetry on mchir. we remark in passing
that a classical g-symmetry is sometimes called abelian to contrast it with a proper (non-
abelian) p-l symmetry, for which the symmetry group itself is endowed with a non-zero pb
(for p-l symmetry, see e.g. [7], [17] and references therein).

for

 := 2 .

motivated by the somewhat surprising result obtained above, we now investigate what
conditions the monodromy dependent exchange r-matrix should satisfy in general to guarantee
that the standard (rigid) right action of g on mchir is a proper p-l symmetry. for this
purpose we endow the group with the sklyanin bracket (1.7) (replacing c now by ), where
r = rt  t  g  g is a constant r-matrix subject to the requirement

[ r12, r23] + cycl. perm. = 2 f

2 : some real constant.

(2.39)

it is easy to check that the rigid right action3 of g on mchir, p : g(x) 7 g(x)p p  g, is a
p-l action if and only if

r(p1m p)  r = (p  p)1(r(m)  r)(p  p).

(2.40)

this simply means that the g  g-valued function (r(m)  r) on g must be equivariant with
respect to the natural (innitesimal) actions of g on g and on g  g.

therefore the right multiplication is a p-l symmetry i the exchange r-matrix r(m) is such
a solution of (2.28) that the corresponding dierence (r(m) r) is equivariant. insisting on the
parametrization m = e2, the search for these solutions is made feasible by the observation
that any analytic function of y = 2(ad) is equivariant.
in fact, one of our main results,
proved in [8], is that the r-matrix corresponding to the linear operator

r =

1
2

coth

y
2

  coth(y) + r

(2.41)

solves (2.28). some remarks on this formula are in order. first, note that in the  = 0 case we
mean the limit of the corresponding complex analytic function, whereby we recover r0 in (2.37)
if in addition we use r = 0 (see also footnote 2). second, notice that if  = 1
2, then r = r,
which is the case of the constant exchange r-matrices [7]. third, it is worth stressing that for a
compact lie algebra g constant exchange r-matrices do not exist, because of the negative sign
on the right hand side of (2.28), but our formula (2.41) gives explicit solutions also in this case

of the 2-form  that corresponds to the r-matrix in (2.41) is presented in [7], while in general
the existence (and the uniqueness) of a suitable local 2-form is guaranteed by the solvability of
(2.16). further comments and explicit results are contained in [8].

3 encoding chiral wznw by poisson-lie groupoids

the classical dynamical ybe (1.8) can be regarded as the guarantee of the jacobi identity
in a p-l groupoid [13]. below we show that eq. (2.28) admits an analogous interpretation.
for this, we introduce a family of p-l groupoids in such a way that a subfamily of these
is naturally associated with the possible pbs on the chiral wznw phase space. remarkably,
these groupoids are nite dimensional poisson manifolds that encode practically all information
about the innite dimensional chiral wznw pbs.

roughly speaking, a groupoid is a set, say p , endowed with a partial multiplication that
behaves similarly to a group multiplication in the cases when it can be performed. to under-
stand the following construction one does not need to know details of the notion of a groupoid
(see e.g. [18]), since we shall only use the most trivial example of such a structure, for which

p = s  g  s = {(m f , g, m i)},

(3.1)

where g is a group and s is some set. the partial multiplication is dened for those triples
(m f , g, m i) and ( m f , g, m i) for which m i = m f , and the product is

(m f , g, m i)( m f , g, m i) := (m f , gg, m i )

for m i = m f .

in other words, the graph of the partial multiplication is the subset of

p  p  p = {(m f , g, m i)}  {( m f , g, m i )}  {( m f , g, m i )}

dened by the constraints

m i = m f ,

m f = m f ,

m i = m i ,

g = gg,

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

where the hatted triple encodes the components of the product. a p-l groupoid [19] p is a
groupoid and a poisson manifold in such a way that the graph of the partial multiplication is
a coisotropic submanifold of p  p  p , where p  denotes the manifold p endowed with the
opposite of the pb on p . in other words, this means that the constraints that dene the graph
are rst class. this denition reduces to that of a p-l group in the particular case for which
the set s in (3.1) consists of a single point.

in the interpretation of (1.8) given in [13] the groupoid p is of the form above with s taken
to be a domain in the dual of a cartan subalgebra of a simple lie group g. by thinking about
a generic monodromy matrix, we now take p to be

p = g  g  g,

(3.5)

where g is some open domain in g. on this p , we postulate a pb { , }p dened, by using the
usual tensorial notation, as follows:

{g1, g2}p = g1g2r(m i)  r(m f )g1g2
{g1, m i
{g1, m f
1 , m i
{m i
{m f
1 , m f
1 , m f
{m i

(m i )
2 }p = g1m i
2
(m f )g1
2 }p = m f
2
2 }p = m i
1 m i
2
2 }p = m f
1 m f

2 }p = 0.

(3.6)

here  is an arbitrary constant included for comparison purposes. the structure functions r,
,  are g  g valued functions on g; in components

r(m) = r(m)t  t,

(m) = (m)t  t,

(m) = (m)t  t.

(3.7)

it is quite easy to verify that a pb given by the ansatz (3.6) always yields a p-l groupoid,
since the constraints in (3.4) will be rst class for any choice of the structure functions. of
course, the structure functions must satisfy a system of equations in order for the above ansatz
to dene a pb. the antisymmetry of the pb is ensured by

r = r21

(r21 := rt  t)

and

 =  21,

while the jacobi identity is, in fact, equivalent to the following system of equations:

(3.8)

(3.9)

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

1 r r23 + cycl. perm. =  f ,  = constant,

[r12, r13] + t 
[ 12, 13] + t 
[r12, 13 + 23] + [ 13, 23] + t 
[ 12 + 13, 23] + [ 12, 13] + t 

1 r 23 + cycl. perm. = 0,

3 r r12 + (t 
1 r 23 + (t 

1 r 23  t 

2 r 13) = 0,

3 r 12  t 

2 r 13) = 0.

observe that the left hand side of (3.9) is of the same form as that of (2.28), but in the groupoid
context on the right hand side we have an arbitrary constant . the derivation of the above
equations from the various instances of the jacobi identity is not dicult. what is somewhat
miraculous is that one does not obtain more equations than these. this is actually ensured by
our choice of the relationship between the pbs that involve m i and those that involve m f . as
an illustration, let us explain how (3.9) is derived. by evaluating

{{g1, g2}p , g3}p + cycl. perm. = 0,

(3.13)

one obtains that this is equivalent to

g1g2g3(cid:16)[r12, r13] + t 
= (cid:16)[r12, r13] + t 

1 r r23 + cycl. perm.(cid:17) (m i ) =
1 r r23 + cycl. perm.(cid:17) (m f )g1g2g3.

(3.14)

this holds if and only if the expression in the parenthesis is a constant, ad-invariant element
of 3(g), and  f is the only such element for a simple lie algebra g.

we have seen that the chiral wznw pbs are encoded by equations (2.27), (2.21) and
(2.22), where  and  are dened by (2.23) in terms of a solution r of (2.28). now our point
is the following: a p-l groupoid can be naturally associated with any poisson structure on the
chiral wznw phase space by taking the triple r, ,  that arises in the wznw model to be
the structure functions of a p-l groupoid according to (3.6).

it can be checked that the jacobi identities of the p-l groupoid (3.9)(3.12) are satised
for any triple r, ,  that arises in the wznw model. this actually follows without any
computation since, indeed, the jacobi identities of the chiral wznw pbs in (2.27), (2.21),
(2.22) lead to the same equations, with  =  1
4, and they are satised since they follow from
the symplectic form 

chir.

among the chiral wznw p-l groupoids described above there are those special cases
for which r satises (2.40) with some constant r-matrix r in correspondence with a right p-l

10

action of g on the chiral wznw phase space. under this circumstance one can verify that the
two maps dened by

p  g  ((m f , g, m i), p) 7 (m f , gp, p1m i p)  p

(3.15)

and respectively by

g  p  (p, (m f , g, m i)) 7 (pm f p1, pg, m i)  p

(3.16)

are both poisson maps. thus they dene (see also footnote 3) respectively a right and a left
p-l action of the p-l group g, endowed with the pb (1.7) for c = , on the p-l groupoid p .
in [13] p-l groupoids are associated with arbitrary subalgebras k  g, although the cor-
responding dynamical r-matrices are described only if k is a cartan subalgebra. the k = g
special case of their groupoids is in fact equivalent to our p-l groupoid whose structure function
is the r-matrix in (2.37). their p-l groupoids are dierent from ours in general.

the reader may nd a detailed exposition of the subject of this letter and several related
issues in [8]. among the questions for future study, it would be interesting to investigate the
quantization of the above introduced p-l groupoids and to nd other applications for them in
the eld of integrable systems. as for the second question, recall that the classical dynamical
ybe appears not only in the classical chiral wznw model, but also in the theory of the
knizhnik-zamolodchikov-bernard equation [11], the calogero-moser systems [12] etc, and thus
perhaps it might be natural to ask if (2.28) and the associated p-l groupoids can have other
interesting applications.
