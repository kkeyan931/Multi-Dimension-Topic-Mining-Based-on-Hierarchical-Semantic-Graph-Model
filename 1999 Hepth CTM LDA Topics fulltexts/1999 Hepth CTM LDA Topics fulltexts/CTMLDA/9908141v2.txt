abstract

we show that twisted reduced models can be interpreted as noncommutative yang-mills

theory. based upon this correspondence, we obtain noncommutative yang-mills theory with

d-brane backgrounds in iib matrix model. we propose that iib matrix model with d-brane

backgrounds serve as a concrete denition of noncommutative yang-mills. we investigate

d-instanton solutions as local excitations on d3-branes. when instantons overlap, their

interaction can be well described in gauge theory and ads/cft correspondence. we show

that iib matrix model gives us the consistent potential with iib supergravity when they are

well separated.

1 introduction

a large n reduced model has been proposed as a nonperturbative formulation of type iib

superstring theory[1][2]. it is dened by the following action:

s = 

1
g2 t r(

1
4

[a, a][a, a] +

[a, ]).

1
2

(1.1)

it is a large n reduced model of ten dimensional super yang-mills theory. here  is a ten
dimensional majorana-weyl spinor eld, and a and  are n  n hermitian matrices. it is
formulated in a manifestly covariant way which enables us to study the nonperturbative is-

sues of superstring theory. in fact we can in principle predict the dimensionality of spacetime,

the gauge group and the matter contents by solving this model. we have already initiated

such investigations in [3][4]. we refer our recent review for more detailed expositions and

references[5]. we also note a deep connection between our approach and noncommutative

geometry[6][7].

this action can be related to the green-schwarz action of superstring[8] by using the

semiclassical correspondence in the large n limit:

 i[ , ]  { , },

t r  z d2qg.

in fact eq.(1.1) reduces to the green-schwarz action in the schild gauge[9][14][15]:

sschild = z d2[qg(

1
4{x , x }2 

i
2

{x , }) + qg].

(1.2)

(1.3)

through this correspondence, the eigenvalues of a matrices are identied with the spacetime
coordinates x (). the n =2 supersymmetry manifests itself in sschild as

(1) = 
(1)x  = i,

,

1
2

and

(2) = ,

(2)x  = 0.

(1.4)

(1.5)

the n =2 supersymmetry (1.4) and (1.5) is directly translated into the symmetry of s as

(1) =

[a, a],

i
2

(1)a = i,

1

(1.6)

and

(2) = ,

(2)a = 0.

if we take a linear combination of (1) and (2) as

(1) = (1) + (2),
(2) = i((1)  (2)),

we obtain the n =2 supersymmetry algebra.

(1.9)

the n =2 supersymmetry is a crucial element of superstring theory.
constraints on the spectra of particles. furthermore it determines the structure of the inter-

it imposes strong

actions uniquely in the light-cone string eld theory[2]. the iib matrix model is a nonper-

turbative formulation which possesses such a symmetry. therefore it has a very good chance

to capture the universality class of iib superstring theory. these symmetry considerations

force us to interpret the eigenvalues of a as the space-time coordinates. note that our

argument is independent of the d-brane interpretations which are inevitably of semiclassical

nature[10].

we recall the typical classical solutions of (1.1) which represent innitely long static

d-strings. when  = 0, the equation of motion of (1.3) is

{x ,{x , x }} = 0.
corresponding to this, the equation of motion of (1.1) is

[a, [a, a]] = 0.

(1.10)

(1.11)

we can easily construct a solution of (1.10), which represents a static d-string extending
straight in the x 1 direction:

x 0 = t ,
l
2
other x s = 0,

x 1 =

,

2

(1.12)

where t and l are large enough extensions of a d-string and

0    1,
0    2.

(1.13)

considering the relation between the commutator and the poisson bracket, we obtain a

solution of (1.11) corresponding to the above one as follows:

a0 =

a1 =

t
2n
l
2n

q  p0,
p  p1,

other as = 0,

(1.14)

where t and l are large enough extensions of a d-string, and q and p are n  n hermitian
matrices having the following commutation relation and the eigenvalue distributions:

and

[q, p] = i,

2n,
0  q 
0  p  2n.

(1.15)

(1.16)

strictly speaking such p and q do not exist for nite values of n. for large values of n,

however, we expect that (1.15) can be approximately satised, because it is nothing but

the canonical commutation relation. as is well-known in the correspondence between the
classical and quantum mechanics, the total area of the p  q phase space is equal to 2
multiplied by the dimension of the representation. in this sense (1.16) indicates that p and
q are n  n matrices.

the cases in which [a, a] = cnumber  c have a special meaning. these correspond
2c in the n =2

to bps-saturated backgrounds [11]. indeed, by setting  equal to  1
supersymmetry (1.6) and (1.7), we obtain the relations

((1)  (2)) = 0,
((1)  (2))a = 0.

(1.17)

namely, half of the supersymmetry is preserved in these backgrounds. it is possible to con-

struct higher dimensional solutions which preserve half of the supersymmetry in an analogous

way. the d-branes in iib matrix model have been investigated in [16][17][18][19].

3

the bosonic part of the action vanishes for the commuting matrices (a)ij = x

i ij where
i and j are color indices. these are the generic classical vacuum congurations of the model.
we have proposed to interpret x

i as the space-time coordinates. if such an interpretation is
correct, the distributions of the eigenvalues determine the extent and the dimensionality of

spacetime. hence the structure of spacetime is dynamically determined by the theory. as

we have shown in [3], spacetime exits as a single bunch and no single eigenvalue can escape

from the rest. however the appearance of a smooth manifold itself is not apparent in this

approach since we nd four dimensional fractals in a simple approximation. although it is

very plausible that gauge theory and gravitation may appear as low energy eective theory,

we are still not sure how matter elds propagate [4].

the situation drastically simplies if we consider noncommutative backgrounds. these

are the d-brane like solutions which preserve a part of susy. although the ultimate relevance

of these solutions to the vacuum of iib matrix model is not clear, we can certainly test our

ideas to get a realistic model for space-time and matter with these backgrounds. we can

indeed show that gauge theory appears as the low energy eective theory. in the case of m

coincident d-branes, we obtain noncommutative super-yang mills theory of 16 supercharges

in the gauge group of u(m).

it is of course well-known that the low energy eective action for d-branes is super yang-

mills theory. if we mod out the theory with the translation operator, we immediately nd the

corresponding super yang-mills theory [20][21]. noncommutative yang-mills theories have

been obtained by the compactication on noncummutative tori[7]. by compactication, we

may modify the theory by throwing away many degrees of freedom. we are essentially left

with gauge theory. it is now well perceived through ads/cft correspondence that gauge

theory can represent gravitation in the vicinity of the d-branes[23]. however gauge theory

is not capable to describe gravitation in the at space-time far from the brane.

we point out that well-known twisted reduced models[13] are equivalent to noncommu-

tative yang-mills theory. the expansion around the innitely extended d-branes in iib

matrix model denes a twisted reduced model. using the equivalence, we nd noncommu-

tative yang-mills theory in iib matrix model. we therefore propose that iib matrix model

with d-brane backgrounds provides us a concrete denition of noncommutative yang-mills

theory. we point out that iib matrix model contains nonlocal degrees of freedom which can

represent the gravitational interaction in the at ten dimensional space-time far from the

branes. this fact will be demonstrated by calculating the potential between a d-instanton

4

and an anti-d-instanton on d3-branes.

the organization of this paper is as follows. in section 2, we show that noncommutative

yang-mills theory is equivalent to large n twisted reduced models. in section 3, we apply the

result of section 2 to iib matrix model with d-brane backgrounds. we study d-instantons in

section 4. section 5 is devoted to conclusions and discussions. there we discuss the relation

between the maldacena conjecture and the iib matrix model conjecture.

2 noncommutative yang-mills as twisted reduced model

in this section, we show that noncommutative yang-mills theory is equivalent to twisted

reduced models. reduced models are dened by the dimensional reduction of d dimensional

gauge theory down to zero dimension (a point)[12]. we consider d dimensional u(n) gauge

theory coupled to adjoint matter as an example:

s = z ddx

1
g2 t r(

1
4

[d, d][d, d] +

[d, ]),

1
2

where  is a majorana spinor eld. the corresponding reduced model is

s = 

1
g2 t r(

1
4

[a, a][a, a] +

[a, ]).

1
2

(2.1)

(2.2)

now a and  are n  n hermitian matrices and each component of  is d-dimensional
majorana-spinor. we expand the theory around the following classical solution.

[p, p] = ib,

(2.3)

where b are c-numbers. we remark that this commutation relation cannot be satised

with nite size matrices of dimension n. in fact it is spoiled at the boundary. nevertheless

we can still assume it as long as we consider the degrees of freedom which are localized in the

region far from the boundary. although such a background is no longer a stable solution,

its life time becomes arbitrary large in the large n limit. we assume the rank of b to be
d and dene its inverse c  in d dimensional subspace. the directions orthogonal to the

subspace is called the transverse directions. p satisfy the canonical commutation relations
and they span the d dimensional phase space. the semiclassical correspondence shows that
the volume of the phase space is vp = n(2) d/2detb. since we identify p as momenta,
the phase space corresponds to momentum space which is also called by the same name in

particle physics.

5

we expand a = p + a. we fourier decompose a and  elds as

a = xk
 = xk

a(k)exp(ic k p),

(k)exp(ic k p).

(2.4)

the hermiticity requires that a(k) = a(k) and (k) = (k). let us consider the
case that p consist of d/2 canonical pairs (pi, qi) which satisfy [pi, qj] = ibij. we also
assume that the solutions possess the discrete symmetry which exchanges canonical pairs

and (pi  qi) in each canonical pair. we then nd vp = l d where l is the extension of each
p. the volume of the unit quantum in phase space is l d/n =  d where  is the spacing
of the quanta. b is related to  as b = 2/(2). the eigenvalues of p are quantized in
the unit of l/n2/ d = /n1/ d. so we restrict the range of k as n1/ d/2 < k < n1/ d/2.
since |p| < l, we can assume that k is quantized in the unit of /n1/ d. so pk runs over

n2 degrees of freedom which coincide with those of n dimensional hermitian matrices.

we can construct a map from a matrix to a function as

we consider the product of two matrices

a  a(x) = xk

a(k)exp(ikx).

(2.5)

a(k)exp(ic k p),

b(k)exp(ic  k p),

a = xk
b = xk
ab = xk,l

a(k)b(l)exp(

1
2

c kl)exp(ic (k + l)p).

(2.6)

by this construction, we obtain the  product
ab  a(x)  b(x),
ic 

2

a(x)  b(x)  exp(

2

 )a(x + )b(x + )|==0.

(2.7)

the operation t r over matrices can be exactly mapped on the integration over functions as

t r[a] = detb(

)

dxa(x).

it is easy to understand this statement if we consider the two dimensional case.

t r(exp(ic k p))

= z dq < q|exp(ik0 p/b)exp(ik1 q/b)exp(ik0k1/b)|q >

= 2b(k0)(k1).

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

we may interpret the newly emerged coordinate space as the semiclassical limit of x =
c  p. in such an interpretation

a(x) = t r[xa],

(2.14)

where x denotes a density matrix localized around the eigenvalue x. semiclassically we

indeed nd eqs. (2.5) and (2.8) although we emphasize that eq.(2.10) is the exact correspon-

dence.

applying the rule eq.(2.10), the bosonic action becomes

we therefore nd noncommutative u(1) gauge theory.

in order to obtain noncommutative yang-mills theory with u(m) gauge group, we con-
sider new classical solutions which are obtained by replacing each element of p by the mm
unit matrix:

p  p  1m.

(2.17)

the uctuations around this background a and  can be fourier decomposed in the analogous
way as in eq.(2.4) with m dimensional matrices a(k) and (k) which satisfy a(k) = a(k)
and (k) = (k). it is then clear that [p + a, o] can be mapped onto the nonabelian
covariant derivative do(x) once we use  product. applying our rule (2.10) to the action

 | = /n1/ d as we have explained in this section. here we need to remark on the

since |kmin
novelty of our interpretation of twisted reduced models since it has been interpreted as large

8

n limit of u(n) gauge theory. our innovation is that we have constructed the coordinate
space in the matrices by the relation x = c  p. the remarkable feature of our construc-
tion is the appearance of the coordinate space out of momentum space. it is thanks to the

noncommutativity of momentum space. we may interpret that the noncommutativity eec-
tively introduces the maximum momentum scale . since x = c  p, the large momentum
region corresponds to large length scale in the dual x space. thus the physics beyond this

momentum scale is better understood in the dual coordinate space. therefore the whole

construction reminds us string theory and t duality.

in fact we will see in the following

section that the identical structure emerges in association with the d-branes in iib matrix

model.

3 noncommutative yang-mills and d-branes

in this section we apply the results of the preceding section to d-branes. we notice that

the d-string solution in eq.(1.14) is precisely the type of the backgrounds in twisted reduced

models we have considered in the preceding section. as we have found in section 2, the both

momentum space and coordinate space are embedded in the matices of twisted reduced
models. they are related by x = c  p. this relation should be understood in the follwing
sense. the plane wave with a wave vector k corresponds to an eigenstate of p = [p,
]
with k as the eigenvalue. they are commutative to each other since |k| < . the dual
coordinate space is embedded in the large eigenvalues of the matrices which are rotated by
c . they are also commutative. we obtain the same physics if we interpret k as momenta
or c  p as coordinates x.

we need to interpret a as coordinates in iib matrix model due to n =2 susy as we
have emphasized in the introduction. for this purpose, we identify the solution of iib matrix
model as x which satisfy.

[x, x] = ic  .

(3.1)

now the plane waves correspond to the eigenstates of p with small eigenvalus, where p =
b x. x and p satisfy the canonical commutation relation:
 . we expand
a = x + a as before and a and  can be fourier decomposed as in

[x, p] = i

a = xk
 = xk

a(k)exp(ik x),

(k)exp(ik x).

9

(3.2)

the space-time translation is realized by the following unitary operator:

exp(ipd)(x + a)exp(ip d)

= x + d +xk

a(k)exp(ikd)exp(ik x).

(3.3)

we nd that a(k) is multiplied by the phase exp(ikd)a(k).

once the eigenvalues of p are identied with k, the coordinate space has to be embedded
in the rotated matrices as we have seen in section 2. if we identify the large eigenvalues of
a as the coordinates x, we have to rotate the covariant derivatives as follows:

[x + a, o]  c (

1
i

o(x) + b(x)  o(x)  o(x)  b(x)).

(3.4)

note that we have dened a new gauge eld b(x) by this expression. we can map the

matrices onto functions by using the rule eq.(2.10) which is derived in the preceding section.

we consider the gauge invariance on d-string. the iib matrix model is invariant under
the unitary transformation: a  uau ,   uu . as we shall see, the gauge symmetry
can be embedded in the u(n) symmetry. we expand u = exp(i) and parameterize

under the gauge transformation, we nd the uctuations around the xed background trans-

(k)exp(ik0 x0 + ik1x1).

form as

a  a + i[x, ]  i[a, ]

exp(ik0 x0 + ik1x1)(a(k) + ic k (k))

i(k0l1  k1l0)

(3.7)

we interpret the above result as

(x)  (x) +

exp(ik0 x0 + ik1x1) (k)

where  = c (x). we indeed nd u(1) gauge group in the commutative limit. the
leading corrections in 1/b represent the volume preserving dieomorphism.

applying the rule eq.(2.10), the bosonic action becomes

=

where d = /(ix) + b and a = q1/b. the fermionic action becomes

t r [a, ]

= z d2xtr( [d, ] + b [, ]),

(3.9)

(3.10)

where  =  . we therefore nd noncommutative two dimensional n =8 u(1) gauge
theory.

we next consider m parallel d-strings. we can construct such a solution acl

 by replacing
each element of a d-string solution by an m by m unit matrix. as before we decompose
a = acl
the generalized rule which implies [a,

 + a where each element of a is now an m by m matrix. we can simply apply
]  c d where d is the nonabelian covariant

derivative. the bosonic action becomes

(3.11)

the symbol tr implies taking the trace over u(m) gauge group. the fermionic action becomes

t r [a, ]

= z d2xtr( [d, ] + b [, ]).

(3.12)

we therefore nd two dimensional n =8 super yang-mills theory with u(m) gauge group.
we move on to consider higher dimensional d-branes. a d3-brane may be constructed

as follows:

a0 =

other as = 0,

(3.13)

which may be embedded into n1n2 dimensional matrices. we can further consider m parallel

d3-branes after replacing each element of the d3-brane solution by m by m unit matrix.
under the replacements a  c d and a  (1/b), the bosonic action becomes

(3.14)

where we integrate over the four dimensional world volume of d3-branes. as for the fermionic

action, we nd

t r [a, ]

= z d4xtr( [d, ] + [, ]).

(3.15)

we thus nd four dimensional n =4 super yang-mills theory. the yang-mills coupling is
found to be g2b2. recall that (2/b)2 = r4 is the unit volume of a quantum and r is the
average spacing. if we consider a background with larger r for xed g2, we nd that the

yang-mills coupling decreases.

in this section, we have obtained noncommutative yang-mills theory with d-brane back-

grounds in iib matrix model to all orders in power series of 1/b. alternatively we can view

the iib matrix model with d-brane backgrounds as a concrete denition of noncommutative

yang-mills theory.

4 d-instantons in iib matrix model

as we have shown in section 3, the low energy eective theory with d3-backgrounds are

super yang-mills theory.

in super yang-mills theory, there are local nontrivial solutions,

namely instantons. the equation of motion in iib matrix model is

[a, [a, a]] = 0.

(4.1)

12

with our substitution rule, a  c d, we obtain,
[d, [d, d]] = 0.

(4.2)

since the instantons are nontrivial solutions of gauge theory, they must become those of

iib matrix model after ramications at short distances. as we have shown, short distance

modication of yang-mills theory in iib matrix model is to render it noncommutative. in
fact such solutions on noncommutative r4 are constructed in [22].

the t hooft solution is

a(x) = i(x)1(x),

(x) = 1 +

2

|x  xi|2 ,

(4.3)

where  is self-dual in  and takes values in traceless two by two hermitian matrices.

the location of the instanton is denoted by xi and  is its size. the prescription is just

replace (x) by its noncommutative analog. although it is an interesting problem to study

small instantons whose size is comparable to r, it suces to consider instantons whose size

is much larger than r in this section.

let us consider an instanton solution rst. the classical value of the action is

s =

2t l3
g2(2)2 +

1
b2g2 .

(4.4)

we interpret the rst and the second term of eq.(4.4) as the action of two d3-branes and

that of a d-instanton respectively. it preserves one fourth of the supersymmetry and hence

eq.(4.4) receives no quantum corrections. in order to see whether the solution preserves a

part of supersymmetry, we consider

this argument is valid for generic (anti)self-dual eld congurations.

we next consider a classical solution of iib matrix model which represents an instanton

and an (anti)instanton. we can realize u(4) gauge theory by considering four d3 branes.

we embed an instanton into the rst su(2) part and the other (anti)instanton into the

remaining su(2) part. we separate them in the fth dimension by the distance b:

the classical action is twice of eq.(4.4). while two instanton system receives no quantum

corrections, the instanton - anti-instanton system receives quantum corrections since it is

no longer bps. we now evaluate the one loop eective potential due to an instanton and

(anti)instanton. since they are local excitations, they must couple to gravity. these solutions

are characterized by the adjoint eld strength f which does not vanish at the locations of

the instantons. let us assume that they are separated by a long distance compared to their

sizes. we also assume that b >> r. then we can choose two disjoint blocks in each of which

a large part of an (anti)instanton is contained. let the location and the size of instantons
(xi, i) and (xj, j). the ten dimensional distance of them is r2 = (xi  xj)2 + b2. here we
have assumed that r >> . the potential between the i-th and the j-th blocks due to the

o-diagonal (i, j) block has been calculated in [1].

the novel feature of eq.(4.8) is that we have kept axion type interactions also. note that

where di

 denotes the covariant derivative of the instanton background which is localized

dilaton, axion and gravitons. we nd that the potential between two instantons vanish

due to their bps nature. on the other hand, the following potential is found between an

instanton and an anti-instanton

(4.12)

we remark that the above approximation is no longer valid when b < r. in this case

the interactions between an instanton and an anti-instanton is well described by the gauge

elds which are low energy modes of iib matrix model. they are close to diagonal degrees

of freedom in iib matrix model. their contribution can be estimated by gauge theory. on

the other hand when b >> r, the standard gauge theory description breaks down since we

have to take account of the noncommutativity. in that case, we believe that the block-block

interaction gives us a correct result. it is in a sense t dual description to gauge theory. the

one loop eective potential can be calculated by gauge theory when b << r

where we have assumed b >> 1/b. the above expression is estimated as follows:

(4.14)

where r = |y  z| is assumed to be much larger than . we note that eq.(4.14) falls o with
the identical power for large r with eq.(4.12).

in ads/cft correspondence, the instanton size is interpreted as the radial coordinate

of a d-instanton in ads5[24]. with this interpretation, the d-instanton approaches the

boundary of ads5 when the instanton size vanishes. the gravitational interaction between
d-instantons in at space is known to be of the form 4/r8. if we assume that   1/b
and g2  gs2, we nd that eq.(4.12) indeed of such a type. in ads5, it is modied as

where l is the radius of ads5. here we notice a limitation of gauge theory. we cannot

describe gravitational interaction between a d-instanton and an anti-d-instanton in at

space far from the branes by gauge theory. on the other hand the iib matrix model can

describe the gravitational interaction between them in both regions near and far from the

branes. hence we nd an important advantage of iib matrix model over gauge theory as

a nonperturbative formulation of superstring.

it is due to the existence of nonlocal (or

noncommutative) degrees of freedom in iib matrix model.

we have proposed that the fundamental strings are created by the wilson loop operators.

simple examples are the following vertex operators for a dilaton, an axion and gravitons

which are consistent with eq.(4.10):

t r{[a, a][a, a]exp(ika)} + fermionic terms,
t r{[a, a][a, a]exp(ik a )} + fermionic terms,
t r{[a, a][a, a]exp(ika)} + fermionic terms.

we have the corresponding vertex operators in cft:

z d4xtr([d, d][d, d])exp(ik  x) + fermionic terms,
z d4xtr([d, d][d, d])exp(ik  x) + fermionic terms,
z d4xtr([d, d][d, d])exp(ik  x) + fermionic terms.

(4.16)

(4.17)

under the replacements a  c d, a  1/b, the wilson loops in iib matrix

model coincide with those in cft such as

t r{[a, a][a, a]exp(ik(x + a))}

16

 z d4xtr{[d, d][d, d] + [d, ][d, ]}exp(ik  x) +    ,

(4.18)

where we have replaced x  x in the argument of the exponential.
investigate in more detail the above noticed relationship between the wilson loops in iib

it is interesting to

matrix model and the vertex operators in cft.

5 conclusions and discussions

in this paper we have shown that large n twisted reduced models can be interpreted in

terms of noncommutative yang-mills theory. such a system appears in iib matrix model as

innitely extended d-brane solutions which preserve a part of susy. we therefore obtain

noncommutative yang-mills theory with such backgrounds. we propose that iib matrix

model with such a background provides us a precise denition of noncommutative yang-mills

theory. the novel feature is that the real coordinate space and the conjugate momentum

space can be embedded into matrices in the large n limit. we have studied d-instanton

interactions. when they overlap, their interaction is well described by gauge theory. when

they are well separated in the fth dimension, the gauge theory description breaks down. in

that situation, iib matrix model provides an accurate description and we nd the result is

consistent with iib supergravity. in this sense, iib matrix model is valid in both the gauge

theory region and supergravity regions. therefore we need not assume the overlap of the

two unlike ads/cft correspondence.

let us consider the implication of our results on maldacena conjecture[23]. we have

shown that u(n) gauge theory is obtained if we consider n parallel d-branes in iib matrix

model whose distances are much smaller compared to string scale. the basic conjecture of

iib matrix model is that it is a nonperturbative formulation of iib superstring theory. its

low energy limit is iib supergravity. the tree level string theory is considered to be obtained

by summing planar diagrams and string perturbation theory is identied with the topological

expansion of the matrix model. if we consider the large n limit with xed thooft coupling,

we are left with the planar diagrams. therefore the maldacena conjecture follows from our

iib matrix model conjecture. we can also point out the limitations of maldacena conjecture.

the gauge theory description is valid only when the distances between the d-branes are much

smaller than the string scale. therefore it is not applicable when the branes are separated

by the distance much longer than the string scale. in other words, cft cannot describe the

at space far from the brane. in this regard, iib matrix model has the denite advantage

17

as we have demonstrated by the instanton interactions.

although we have obtained 4 dimensional gauge theory with d-brane backgrounds, we

nd ten dimensional gravity. it is presumably not a bad news for our scenario to get realistic

models out of iib matrix model, since d3-brane backgrounds possess enormous vacuum
energy density (1/)2. this is certainly what has been expected from string perturbation

theory. although the eigenvalue distributions of a are sharply peaked at four dimensional

hyperplane, they presumably spread out into the transverse directions due to the massless

scalars. it suggests us to consider the solutions without massless scalars (broken susy?) to

obtain four dimensional gravity. in any case, noncommutative geometry may be a crucial

element to obtain gauge theory in iib matrix model.

we conclude this section with the following comment. chepelev and tseytlin argued that

our d-brane solutions can be interpreted as not pure d-branes but those with nonvanishing

u(1) eld strength[17]. in this paper we have shown that our solution can be interpreted in

terms of noncommutative geometry with vanishing u(1) eld strength. recently seiberg and

witten has pointed out that noncommutative yang-mills is equivalent to ordinary yang-mills

theory with a nonvanishing b-eld or u(1) eld strength[25]. apparently these arguments

are consistent with each other and reect the t duality of string theory.
