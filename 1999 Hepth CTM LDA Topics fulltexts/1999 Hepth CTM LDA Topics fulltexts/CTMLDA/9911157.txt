(11) considering 2, small value (usually believed smaller 10122), entropy area bound satised turning point. consider happens 2a0 near nal stage collapse, universe shrinks planck scale. symmetry, lh(turning) 1/21/2 {$9904120$} time. scale factor planck lh time = 1 a(t = 1) = (2gm0/)1/2{sin}1/. ratio s/a 1/21/2. hence a(turning) 4 small , ratio much bigger unity universe general equation state 1 < 2. nd prior point maximal expansion, holographic constraints hold. however point ratio exceeds unity holographic bound cannot maintained. result agreement (3+1)-dimensions. comparison, easily see general d-dimensional case, eq.(4) gets dt dt (ad1) + p (ad1) = 0, view equation state (5) modied solution a(d1). going calculations, learn eq(11) form, leading similar conclusions. point however, rather stay 2+1-dimensions able draw conclusions. pointed {$9904120$}, problem expected cured replacing particle horizon apparent horizon proposed {$9902173$}, turning point = 0, eq.(16) ref.{$9902173$} diverges, is, 4 3a2(t) a(t) . (12) therefore new holographic principle violated even earlier. cannot naively expect bound saved considering universe unusual negative pressure matter analoguous 4d closed universe case , see (8), big bang universe cannot sucient expansion < 1, therefore classical description valid. appealing establish gsl 3d universes study relation gsl fs bound. using idea proposed {$9902173$}, denition total entropy domain 3d universes containing one cosmological horizons given = nh sh, nh number cosmological horizons within given comoving volume divided volume single horizon nh = a(t)2/|h(t)|2; sh entropy within given horizon. classical gsl requires cosmological evolution must obey ds 0, corresponds nh tsh + tnh sh 0 (13) adopting idea used gsl black hole, consider could many sources types entropy, total entropy sum contributions. supposing single type entropy dominant, sh = |h|, indicates type 5 entropy source, therefore = (a|h|)2|h|, eq(13) rewritten 2h + (2 + ) h h 0. let us reexpress eqs.(2-4) forms, k a2 h 2 = 2g h = 2g(p + ) + + 2h(p + ) = 0 k a2 (14) (15) substitute (14). nd relations equations state determined gsl p p 2 2 + 1 + 2 2 + 1 + k 2g(2 + )a2 k 2g(2 + )a2 , , f h > 0, f h < 0. (16) (17) last terms eqs(16,17), a2 corresponds energy whole universe, e = a2 k, thus last terms eqs. (16,17) neglected. employing rst law thermodynamics, ds = de + p dv = ( + p )dv + v d, temperature obtained 1 = ( e )v = , e = v, = sv , therefore = 1 g(2 + )|h| (18) ensure singularities avoided expressions total entropy s, ts temperature space limit vanishing h taken account, reasonable physical range lie within region 1 0. let us consider dominant contribution entropy universe given geometric entropy sg whose source existence cosmological horizon . speculative notion introduced . let us herewith suppose component entropy arises geometry. thus position discuss relation gsl fs entropy bound. system cosmological horizon, sh g given g = |h|1g1 sh n , (19) corresponds = 1. substituting value eqs.(16,17), equations state corresponding adiabatic evolution dominant sg obtained. expanding 6 universe h > 0, gsl requires p , agreement results obtained {$9910185$} fs bound. however negative h, corresponding contracting universe, gsl requires p/ (1,). range corresponds > 2 eq.(5), ruled 3d contracting universes fs bound discussions. therefore, 3d contracting universes fs bound compatible gsl. whether adding missing quantum entropy term developing quantum mechan- ical version gsl help us arriving compatibility fs bound gsl contracting 3d universes still clear. using denition quantum entropy 4d cases , dsquan. = dnh , chemical potential, always taken positive, nh = (ah)2, obtain ds = dsclass. + dsquan. = dnh sh + nhdsh dnh (20) sh classical entropy within cosmological horizon sh = |h| classical entropy dominated single source. quantum modied gsl expressed (2h + 2 h h )nh (sh ) + h h nh sh 0. (21) considering geometric entropy still dominates classical entropy, = 1, learn (21) contracting universe, h < 0. p sh sh 2 (22) sh, returns classical case leads p (1,); quantum eects p (1,); quantum eect dominates, p (0,). results never compatible requirement < 0 corresponds > 2 0 < < 1, respectively, comparable classical eects, sh , say sh , fs bound, p > 1 1 < p unacceptable fs bound contracting universes. therefore quantum consideration still cannot lead compatibility fs bound gsl. since believed second law thermodynamics fundamental principle physics, incompatible result gives us additional motivation seek reformu- lation cosmic holographic principle. one may attribute incompatibility 7 argument fs bound strong, looser cosmic entropy bound called solve conict gsl. possible way suggested veneziano 4d cosmology {$9902173$} replacing fs bound bound. based upon argument black hole larger h 1 cannot form, generalizing 3d cases nd largest entropy region corresponding one black hole per hubble volume h 2 2 p|h|, mp = g1/2 n , bound 3d universes dened recalling denitions bound fs bound, 3d expressed sh 2 p|h|1 (23) sbe el/h dp/h d2 sf dp/h dp/l2 p p dp/h h 2d2 p dp/l2 p (24) (25) dp particle horizon, lp h 1, consider applied non-inationary cosmology, h mp. substitute particle horizon dp . thus 3d cases reproduce relation among dierent entropy bounds rst obtained 4d cases {$9902173$}, = s1/2 f s1/2 (26) easy see bound much looser fs bound. attractive point study whether bound compatible gsl 3d cosmological models. assuming single dominant entropy form, sh = (|h| mp bound (23) written ), p|h|1 considering reasonable physical region , need ) 2 (|h| mp |h| mp 1/+1 p . (27) (28) bound, learn |h| maximum value, therefore order violate bound need expanding universe h > 0, evolution 3d universe undergoes decelerated expansion, say h > 0, h < 0. gsl allows evolution. since physical region 1 0, eq(14) reads 2h + (2 + ) > 2h + h h 0 h h 8 (29) h < 0, leads directly requirement equation state, is, p . quite natural thus entropy bound valid without violation gsl. contracting universe h < 0, satisfy entropy bound, need universe experience decelerated contraction, namely h > 0. requirement obviously compatible gsl, eqs(14)and (29) tell us 2|h|2 h (30) false h > 0. luckily conict bound gsl resolved considering quantum modied gsl (21). contracting 3d universes, h < 0, eq(21) rewritten 2|h|2nh (sh ) h. (31) neglecting quantum eect, sh, eq(31) boils (30) = 1. however consider quantum eect strong, namely sh < 0, rewrite eq(31) decelerated contraction h > 0, eq(32) certainly holds. thus considering quantum eect, conict bound gsl overcome. summary found analogously 3d closed universes, fs bound 3d cosmological models negative cosmological constant breaks regardless value k. unlike 4d closed universe , negative pressure matter cannot used save fs bound. establishing gsl 3d cosmologies, shown state equations required consistent needed fs bound, shows fs bound gsl compatible. furthermore shown conict cannot resolved taking account quantum modied version gsl, addressed 4d cases. considering gsl fundamental principle physics, motivations rethink expression cosmic holography. extending dierent cosmic entropy bounds 3d cosmology, reproduced relation bound, bound fs bound rst obtained 4d cases {$9902173$}. compared fs bound, bound looser, compatible gsl. result agrees claimed 4d cosmology  supports argument bound candidate describing 9 2|h|2 h | 2 + sh sh | .
