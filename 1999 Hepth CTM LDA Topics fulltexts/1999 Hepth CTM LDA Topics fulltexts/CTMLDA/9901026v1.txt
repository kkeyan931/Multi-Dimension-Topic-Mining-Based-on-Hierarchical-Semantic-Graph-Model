abstract

evidence for the possible existence of a quantum process opposite to the famous hawking

radiation (evaporation) of black holes is presented. this new phenomenon could be very

relevant in the case of exotic multiple horizon nariai black holes and in the context of common

grand unied theories. this is clearly manifested in the case of the so(10) gut, that is

here investigated in detail. the remarkable result is obtained, that anti-evaporation can

occur there only in the susy version of the theory. it is thus concluded that the existence

of primordial black holes in the present universe might be considered as an evidence for

supersymmetry.

in his celebrated paper, ref. [1], published over twenty years ago, steven hawking made

one of the most striking discoveries of the history of black hole physics: the possibility for

black holes to evaporate, as a result of particle creation. this eect which is now called

the hawking radiation process produced a deep impact in our understanding of quantum

gravity. nowadays it has become to be considered as a classical test of the theory.

what conferes this eect its great importance is the observation that hawking radiation

is a universal phenomenon. one of its most dramatic consequences being the fact that all

primordial black holes should evaporate in the process of the early universe evolution.

there exists, however, an exotic class of black holes (see ref. [2] for a review) which posses

a multiple horizon and for which the opposite eect might occur. we have investigated this

possibility in detail. consider a nearly degenerate schwarzschild-de sitter black hole (the

so-called nariai black hole [3] in the specialized literature). the schwarzschild-de sitter

black hole represents the neutral, static, spherically symmetric solution of einsteins theory

with a cosmological constant. the corresponding metric looks as follows

ds2 = v ( )dt2 + v 1( )d 2 +  2d2,

v ( ) = 1

 3,

(1)

where  is the mass and  the radius of the black hole, d2 the metric corresponding to

a unit two-sphere, and  is the cosmological constant.

it can be easily checked that the

equation

v ( ) = 0,

(2)

has two positive roots, c and b (we set c > b). here, c and b have the meaning of a

cosmological and a black-hole horizon radius, respectively.

in the degenerate case (which

corresponds to a black hole of maximal mass) both radii coincide and the black hole is in

thermal equilibrium. it is called a nariai black hole.

there are in fact two opposite sources contributing to this equilibrium, namely a radiation

ux coming from the cosmological horizon and the hawking evaporation originated at the

black hole horizon. it is plausible that such a state might be unstable, since it could be

aected by small perturbations of the geometry. this is what happens, indeed.

it was demonstrated in a recent paper by r. bousso and s.w. hawking, ref.

[4], that

a nearly maximal (or nearly degenerated) nariai black hole may not only evaporate as

shown in ref. [1] but also anti-evaporate [4]. in other words, nariai black holes actually

develop two perturbative modes: an evaporating one and an anti-evaporating one. the

mathematical realization of this quantum process, carried out in ref.

[4], is based on the

2

generalized cghs model of two-dimensional dilaton quantum gravity [5], with the dilaton

coupled scalars [6] coming from the so-called minimal four-dimensional scalars in the process

of spherical reduction (for a basic introduction of these concepts the reader is addressed to

ref. [7]).

the possibility of evaporation or anti-evaporation (i.e., increase in size) of a black hole of

this kind is certainly connected with the initial conditions chosen for the perturbations. in

the model of ref. [4], use of the commonly employed hartle-hawking no-boundary conditions

[8] shows that such black holes will most likely evaporate. we are thus left with the original

situation, in this case.

the exotic nariai black holes are not asymptotically at. they will never appear in the

process of star collapse. nevertheless, they could actually be present in the early inationary

universe, through any of the following processes:

1. pair creation of primordial black holes during ination [9];

2. quantum generation due to quantum uctuations of matter elds [10].

in any case, according to the model in ref.

[4], primordial multiple horizon black holes

should quickly evaporate, and it is very unlikely that they could be detected in the present

universe.

however, a dierent model for anti-evaporation of black holes has been proposed recently,

ref. [11], in which these diculties may be overcome. in that model, the quantum eects of

the conformally invariant matter have been taken into account. what is more interesting,

this theory allows for the possibility of including not only scalar elds, but also fermionic

and vector elds (typical of all grand unied theories, guts), whose classical action is

, f is the square of the weyl tensor, g the

gauss-bonnet invariant,  is a mass-dimensional constant parameter, and we choose the
metric as ds2 = e2gdxdx. specially when we assume the solution to be spherically

symmetric, the metric has the form of ds2 = e2(cid:16)p,=0,1 gdxdx + r2

is the metric on the unit two-sphere. the parameter r0 is introduced by hand. note that

0d2(cid:17), where d2

the schwinger-de witt expansion is the corresponding power expansion with respect to the

curvature. having introduced the parameter r0, the scalar curvature given by the metric g
is of the order of 1/r2

0 if there is no singularity, as in the nariai black hole. therefore, if we

choose r0 to be large, the schwinger-de witt type expansion becomes exact.

by solving the quantum eective equations of motion derived from (3) and (4), we can

nd the quantum analogue of the nariai black hole, which has constant scalar curvature
r = r0 and radius e = e0:

(5)

here we assume r0 to be large. furthermore, we can nd the perturbation around the so-

lution. it is given by an eigenfunction of the laplacian in the two-dimensional hyperboloid,

which corresponds to the subspace in the nariai balck hole, given by radial and time coor-

dinates. the fate of the perturbed black hole is governed by the eigenvalue of the laplacian

and we nd that anti-evaporation can occur only if

2n + 7n1/2 > 26n1.

(6)

owing to the fact that the equations of motion in the model by bousso and hawking con-

tain only second order derivatives, anti-evaporation is excluded there by the no-boundary

condition of hartle and hawking. the quantum eective equations of motion given by

(3) and (4), however, contain fourth order derivatives and there the anti-evaporation phe-

nomenon can be consistent with the no-boundary condition.

as an example take, for instance, the usual so(10) gut, which would be a typical model
in the early universe. first, we consider the non-supersymmetric model of [12], with 16  3

4

(generation) fermions and 16 + 120 + (10 or 126) = 136 or 262 higgs scalars (the numbers are

the dimensions of the representations). therefore we obtain 2n + 7n1/2 = 608 or 860, and

the adjoint vector elds (n1 = 45) give a contribution of 26n1 = 1170. thus, we nd that

eq. (6) cannot be satised. the situation is, however, drastically changed when we consider

the supersymmetric model. in the naive supersymmetric extension of the above model, we

have contributions from squarks, higgsinos and gauginos.

including them, we nd that

2n + 7n1/2 = 1971 or 3105, and eq. (6) is then certainly satised, since the contribution

from the vector elds does not change from the one of the non-supersymmetric model. the

above structure is not modied either in the various extensions of the so(10) model that

have been considered more recently. that is, in all these cases for the non-supersymmetric

model eq. (6) is not satised, since the contribution from the vector elds dominates, but

for the supersymmetric models the contribution from the higgsino in the large dimensional

representations dominates and eq.

(6) is fullled. then, under the hypothesis that the

no-boundary initial condition applies, at least some primordial multiple horizon black holes

are going to anti-evaporate.

in other words, primordial black holes might exist for a much longer period (if we consider

some reasonable susy gut as a realistic theory) than it had been expected [1]. primor-

dial black holes would have grown, for some time, until other eects could have stopped

the process. some could even have survived and be present in our universe. then, if these

primordial black holes were observed, they would constitute an indirect evidence of super-

symmetry. the rate p of pair creation of black holes has appeared in [9]:

p = exp

(7)

in the euclidean path integral, the weight of the probability is given in the semi-classical

approximation by substituting the classical black hole solution gclassical

be suppressed. but the magnitude of the exponent depends on the model of ination used.

if our universe were pair created as in the original work by hartle and hawking [8], in the

5

very early universe the energy density could be of the order of the planck scale and then

ef f would be of the order of unity. in such a situation, the pair-creation of the nariai black

hole would not be suppressed. the important consequence being then, that the pair created

black hole would not evaporate and could survive in the present universe.

in summary, we conclude that adopting the so(10) model (in any of its several versions)

and under the hypothesis that the no-boundary initial condition applies, we could obtain a

proof of supersymmetry by nding evidence of the existence of anti-evaporating black holes.

one may argue that, even if they existed, the probability of nding just one black hole of

this kind would be very low. however, in view of the extreme importance of supersymmetry

for all string, brane and conformal theories, and the like, and in view also of the extreme

diculty in proving, by any other means, that such a strongly broken symmetry as susy

is in fact a symmetry of nature (and not merely a beautiful idea), conferes a relevant status

to the results we have here obtained.

again, we concede that the process of anti-evaporation might in fact be rather exotic and

only limited to the very early times of the inationary universe. in the own words of steven

hawking: i regard anti-evaporation as a pathology. notwithstandingthat, the model above

has appeared as a brand new mathematical solution of plausible quantum gravity equations

under the conditions that are usually assumed to be the natural ones during the evolution

of the early universe.

it would not be wise to discard such solution and the physical

scenario it gives rise to before an observational quest is consistently pursued. moreover,

anti-evaporation might also lie on the basis of other cosmological eects (like ination) in

the very early universe. this is presently being investigated by the authors and the results

will be reported elsewhere.

one of us (s.d.o.) would like to thank prof. s.w. hawking for the kind hospitality

at damtp and for very interesting discussions. this investigation has been supported by
