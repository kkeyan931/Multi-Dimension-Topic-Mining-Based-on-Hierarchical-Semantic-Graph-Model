abstract

the four-dimensional minkowski space-time is considered as a three-brane embedded in
ve dimensions, using solutions of ve-dimensional supergravity. these backgrounds have
a string theoretical interpretation in terms of d3-brane distributions. by studying linear
uctuations of the graviton we nd a zero-mode representing the massless graviton in
four-dimensional space-time. the novelty of our models is that the graviton spectrum has
a genuine mass gap (independent of the position of the world-brane) above the zero-mode
or it is discrete. hence, an eective four-dimensional theory on a brane that includes the
massless graviton mode is well dened. the gravitational force between point particles
deviates from the newton law by yukawa-type corrections, which we compute explicitly.
we show that the parameters of our solutions can be chosen such that these corrections
lie within experimental bounds.

1 introduction

the idea that our four-dimensional minkowski space-time m4 can be viewed as a three-
brane embedded in some higher-dimensional curved space-time is appealing and attracted
attention already some years ago [1]. it was recently revived in several works. in partic-
ular in [2, 3] an alternative to the resolution of the mass hierarchy problem between the
planck (mpl  1019 gev) and electroweak (me  1 tev) scales using extra large dimen-
sions [4] was presented. indeed, in the latter scenario a compactication on a general
compact manifold bn with n  2 requires that the size of a typical extra dimension be
of order r = 1 mm or smaller, which is in principle accessible to experiments in the near
future (see, for instance, [5] and references therein). however, as far as the hierarchy
problem is concerned, the original mass hierarchy of mpl
me  1016 is replaced by a new one
of the same order of magnitude between the electroweak scale and the size of the large
dimensions. in [2, 3] a model based on a slice of the ve-dimensional anti-de sitter space
(ads5) was proposed. the eective four-dimensional planck constant was determined
by the curvature of the embedding space rather than the size of the extra dimension,
which is of the same order as the fundamental ve-dimensional scale. assuming that the
square of the fundamental ve-dimensional mass scale and the curvature of ads5 are of
the same order of mpl, one shows that the required hierarchy is of the order of 102.

the scenario of [2, 3] has the desired feature that there exists a square-normalizable
state representing a massless graviton. however, there is in addition a continuum of
massive modes with no mass gap separating them from the massless one. if the curvature
of ads5 is of the order of the four-dimensional eective planck scale, then this gives no
measurable eect to modications of, for instance, the newton law [3]. however, given
our present-day experimental data, this might not be the case and such corrections may
exist [5]. moreover, in order to have a well-dened eective eld theory, it is desirable
to have solutions where the massless graviton is separated from the other massive modes
by a mass gap. these massive modes can be continuous or discrete, with no immediate
eect in phenomenological considerations. it is the purpose of this paper to construct
such models.

it is also desirable to have a string theoretical construction for our models. the
model in [2, 3] can be thought of as a compactication of the near-horizon limit of the
solution for a large number of coinciding d3-branes in type-iib string theory on s5,
and a subsequent truncation of the range of the extra fth dimension. the background
in [3] with one three-brane shares many features with domain wall solutions of four-
dimensional supergravity theories, which were studied extensively in the literature [6]. a
geometry similar to that of the set-up in [2] appears in strongly coupled heterotic string
theories, which arise in calabiyau compactications of the horavawitten model [7]. in
[8] a domain wall solution with two three-branes at the two boundaries was constructed,
which is suitable for a further reduction to four-dimensional supergravity. in [9] a ten-
dimensional background of a conguration of d3-branes in an orientifold of type-ii string
theory was presented, which interpolates between ads5  s5 and m4  t 6 and contains

1

four-dimensional gravity on the branes. it is closely related to the set-up in [2, 3] and
can be viewed as an extension of the ads/cft correspondence [10] to boundary theories
including gravity. it is obvious [11] that the scenario of [2, 3] applies to all minima of
the potential of the ve-dimensional gauged supergravity [12], supersymmetric or not,
although the latter minima may not be stable (at least perturbatively).

in this paper we consider backgrounds of continuous distributions [13, 14] of d3-branes
of type-iib string theory in the near horizon limit, which preserve sixteen supersymme-
tries. we will consider in detail two examples: one that represents d3-branes uniformly
distributed over a disc and one where the distribution is over a three-sphere. these ex-
amples were studied before in [15, 16] in connection with the coulomb branch of strongly
coupled n = 4 super yang-mills theories within the ads/cft correspondence. they
possess many of the desired features we would like to have, in particular they have a
mass gap or a discrete spectrum for the case of the disc and sphere distributions, respec-
tively. however, the massless mode is not square normalizable and this is is one issue we
address and solve in this paper. although we will concentrate on these two backgrounds
for concreteness, we believe that one can in this context study a much larger class of
distributions of d3-branes e.g. shell-type distributions which were also studied before in
[17] as models for the coulomb branch of n = 4 super yang-mills.

the outline of the paper is as follows:

in section 2 we derive the ve-dimensional
backgrounds in the presence of a three-brane that cuts o the space in the fth direction.
in section 3 we study the spectrum of linear uctuations of the graviton in these back-
grounds. it turns out that the equation for gravitons polarized in the directions parallel
to the brane is identical to the massless scalar equation in the same backgrounds. we will
show that a normalizable zero-mode solution, representing the massless graviton, exists,
whereas the massive modes are separated by a mass gap. we use these models in section
4 to study possible measurable eects manifested as corrections to newtons law, which
turn out to be of yukawa-type. our analysis has certain similarities with that performed
for the case of compactications on general compact manifolds in [18]. the range of the
exponential correction is associated with the wavelength of the lightest massive state,
whereas its strength is related to the value of the corresponding wave function at the
position of the brane. in section 5 we present our conclusions and some future directions
of this work. we have also written an appendix, containing some details of the relation
between ten- and ve-dimensional backgrounds and the corresponding ve-dimensional
gauged supergravity theories.

2 the models

in the following we exploit the fact that there exists a big class of ten-dimensional back-
grounds, besides ads5s5, that can be reduced to ve-dimensional models. after the re-
duction to ve dimensions the backgrounds become warped products of four-dimensional
minkowski space with one extra dimension. then we reduce the range of this coordi-

2

nate at some nite value and place a three-brane at the boundary.1 although the fth
coordinate is not necessarily compact, these backgrounds are all eectively compacti-
cations, since the kaluzaklein spectrum contains a zero-mode corresponding to the
four-dimensional gravity of our world and there exists also a mass gap. this mass gap
can be chosen such that the corrections to newtons law lie within present-day experi-
mental limits. therefore, an observer on the brane will eectively see a four-dimensional
world.

we will concentrate on two backgrounds: one (to be called (a)) corresponds to d3-

branes distributed uniformly over a disc, with metric given by

ds2 =

r4/3
r2 (r2 + r2

0)1/3dxdx +

r2
r2/3 (r2 + r2

0)2/3dr2 ,

r  0 ,

(1)

and one (to be called (b)) corresponding to d3-branes distributed uniformly over a three-
sphere, with metric given by

ds2 =

r4/3
r2 (r2  r2

0)1/3dxdx +

r2
r2/3 (r2  r2

0)2/3dr2 ,

r  r0 .

(2)

note that the two metrics are related by the analytic continuation r0  ir0 and  is
the metric of four-dimensional minkowski space-time.

it is useful to present the metrics in their conformally at form

ds2 = e2(z)(dxdx + dz2) .

for model (a) we nd that the coordinate transformation

(4)

z  0 ,
and a rescaling of the space-time coordinates as x  r
(3) with conformal factor

sinh(z/r)

r =

x transforms (1) into the form

similarly for model (b), the coordinate transformation

and the same rescaling of the xs as before, transforms (2) into the form (3) with
conformal factor

e =

sin(z/r)

.

(7)

near the boundary r   (z  0) both spaces are asymptotic to ads5. equivalently,
we recover ads5 if we let the parameter r go to innity.

1the important issue of the determination of the location of the brane from rst principles will not
be addressed in this paper. for the model in [2, 3] a suggestion, based on a modulus-eld stabilization
mechanism, was made [19]; it can presumably be modied to cover our models as well.

3

our models are constructed by taking the above backgrounds and cutting out the
boundary region 0  z  z1 by placing a three-brane at z = z1 (compare footnote 1).
this restriction on the range of z is necessary to obtain dynamical gravity in the eective
four-dimensional theory. it is useful to consider the double cover of this space, which
amounts to requiring reection symmetry with respect to the three-brane. a feature of
these backgrounds is that the ve-dimensional bulk action also contains a scalar eld with
a potential (some facts about ve-dimensional supergravity relevant to our backgrounds
are summarized in appendix a). the ve-dimensional action is the sum of a bulk term
and a boundary term:

s = sbulk + sbrane

gm n m n   p ()(cid:19)

(8)

with zmax =  in case (a) and zmax = r/2 in case (b). the ve-dimensional metric
is denoted by gm n , and r is the corresponding ricci scalar. the potential p of the

scalar eld  is dened in appendix a, and eg is the pullback of the bulk metric to the

four-dimensional world volume of the three-brane. the brane action contains a term,
lbrane, that corresponds to the matter elds living on the brane and will be ignored in
the following; the other term is v , which corresponds to the tension of the brane and
which will be xed shortly by requiring consistency of the equations of motion. we
will show that this also implies the vanishing of the eective cosmological term on the
three-brane.

the equations of motion following from varying the metric and the scalar eld in the

action (8) are

(9)

(10)

the solutions to these equations can be expressed in terms of the bulk solutions without
the three-brane, by a simple replacement that preserves reection invariance z  z1 
(z  z1) with respect to the brane

(11)
this introduces terms proportional to (z  z1) in the equations of motion, which are
cancelled by the source term if we choose the vacuum energy of the three-brane to be

z  z = z1 + |z  z1| .

v = 3(z) exp() =

(12)

where w is an auxiliary function of the scalar eld  and is dened in appendix a.

we will focus our attention to solutions of (9) that preserve some supersymmetry,
so that the corresponding backgrounds are stable, at least perturbatively. the killing
spinor conditions for preserving sixteen supercharges, in the absence of the brane at
z = z1, were derived in [15] and are summarized in appendix a. in our case it turns out
that they are slightly altered by the presence of the brane

the solution is given by the bulk solution after replacing z  z in (5) and (7).

now that we have found the backgrounds, we can proceed to calculate several prop-
erties of the eective four-dimensional models. in this paper we will concentrate on the
gravity sector. this is partly because we do not know the exact form of lbrane; of course,
we could impose the standard model lagrangian, or try to derive it from rst principles.
in the second case, keeping in mind the string theory origin of our backgrounds, this
would most probably amount to expanding the borninfeld action in the corresponding
background. we leave this for future studies and ignore for the moment contributions
of the matter sector to the gravity equations. the quantities we want to study in the
following are the four-dimensional planck constant and the four-dimensional cosmologi-
cal constant, which should vanish for a physical model. in section 3 we will discuss the
spectrum of linearized graviton uctuations and in section 4 the corrections to newtons
law.

in order to calculate the four-dimensional planck mass in terms of the ve-dimensional
fundamental scale, we express the ve-dimensional metric gm n in terms of a four-
dimensional metric g(4), which replaces  in (3) so that the various four-dimensional
geometrical data are non-vanishing. the eective four-dimensional lagrangian thus de-
rived from (8) is

where zmax =  in case (a) and zmax = r/2 in case (b), and m is the ve-dimensional
fundamental planck constant. the eective planck constant in four dimensions, mpl,
can be read o from the rst term in (14). in case (a), we nd

(14)

(15)

(16)

because of the non-vanishing scalar potential p (), the ve-dimensional model has an
eective negative cosmological constant that is z-dependent. hence, it is not obvious
that this will not induce an undesirable cosmological constant in four dimensions (the
latter, if non-vanishing, can be consistently set to zero for the purposes of this paper).
however, this is prevented even by mathematical consistency, since it would imply that
the metric on the three-brane would not be a minkowski but a curved one. indeed it
may be checked that although all terms in (14), except the rst one, contribute to the
cosmological constant, the nal result is zero.

2.1 the parameter space

our models have three parameters: the fundamental ve-dimensional mass scale m, the
position of the brane z1, and the length parameter r. these have to be chosen in such a
way that supergravity is a good approximation as an eective theory. a straightforward
computation for the scalar curvature for the metric (3) gives

r = 4e2(cid:0)2 + 32(cid:1) .

(17)

using the explicit expressions for the conformal factors (5) or (7), it turns out that for
ratios z/r not too close to zmax, the scalar curvature becomes r  const./r2, where the
proportionality constant is of order 1. a similar statement holds for the other curvature
invariants. hence, the condition |r|  m 2 for supergravity to be valid reduces to

rm  1 .

(18)

keeping this in mind, we investigate the dierent physical pictures that are obtained
from various choices of the location of the three-brane z1, as well as of the fundamental
ve-dimensional scale m and the length parameter r.

case i: the three-brane is located at the point where

e(z1) = 1 ,

(19)

which implies, using the background (3), that z1 = 0.984r when the conformal factor is
given by (5) and z1 = 0.972r when the conformal factor is given by (7). we take the
radius of curvature of our background to be of the order of 1 mm and nd that

r  1 mm  1014 gev1 ,

m  108 gev ,

(20)

where the ve-dimensional fundamental mass scale was found using (15). notice that
this value is intermediate between the planck and electroweak energy scales. the picture
that emerges is similar to the case of compactication on a large torus of radius  1 mm.
consistent with that is the fact that both (15) and (16) can be approximated by

m 2

pl  m 3r .

6

(21)

similarly to [4] (for the case of compactication on a large torus), unication of the
fundamental scale m and the electroweak scale me cannot be achieved unless r  1013
m, i.e. r has astronomical size. choosing m at an intermediate scale, as in (20), we
avoid this problem and we are consistent with present-day data.

case ii: the three-brane is located at the point where

e(z1) 

r
z1  1011 ,

(22)

and m and 1/z1 are both taken to be of the order of the electroweak scale  1 tev.
since the argument of the conformal factor is small the four-dimensional planck constant
can be approximated as

m 2

pl 

m 3
z2
1

r3  m 5r3 ,

(23)

which is similar to compactications with three extra dimensions of large size r 
105 mm  108 (gev)1.
in this model the wave functions of the massive gravitons
are extremely small, at z = z1. for this reason, as we shall see in section 4, the yukawa-
type corrections to newtons law turn out to be negligible.

we note that for the choice of parameters we have made above, the condition (18)
is clearly satised. a feature that the two geometries share is that the curvature blows
up close to the brane distribution (at z   and z  /2r for model (a) and (b)
respectively) and corrections due to higher-derivative terms in the action become impor-
tant. however, the region of large curvature is very small and the qualitative picture will
not be altered at all. this point was discussed in [15, 16] from the point of view of the
ten-dimensional d3-brane solution.

3 the graviton: massless and massive modes

in this section we study small uctuations h of the four-dimensional minkowski metric
on the brane and determine the graviton spectrum. in general, this will depend on the
details of the ve-dimensional backgrounds where the four-dimensional minkowski metric
is embedded.

we parametrize the uctuations in the following manner

ds2 = e2(z)(cid:0)( + h)dxdx + dz2(cid:1) ,

(24)

as it is consistent to set to zero the components of the graviton uctuations h5 and h55
as well as the uctuations of the scalar eld . then we insert (24) into (9) and linearize
in h. the calculation is facilitated by the fact that the metric is conformally at. we
 = h = 0.
may also utilize the reparametrization invariance by choosing the gauge h
in this gauge we nd the following equation:

(cid:3)xh + 2

z h + 3

d(z)

dz

zh = 0 ,

(25)

7

which is just the laplace equation of a massless scalar in the ve-dimensional background
(24). the source term due to the three-brane cancels out completely, but the presence of
the brane at z = z1 demands that appropriate boundary conditions are chosen, as we shall
see. we consider uctuations that are plane waves in the four-dimensional minkowski
space-time

h(x, z) = exp(ik  x)h(z) .

(26)

then we nd the following simple dierential equation (we can drop the indices from h
since the dierential equation is the same for all the components of the graviton):

h + 3

d(z)

dz

h + m 2h = 0 ,

(27)

where m 2 = k  k is the mass square of the corresponding graviton uctuation mode.
at the location of the three-brane, the wave function h and its rst derivative are smooth
functions. this implies, because of the reection symmetry with respect to the three-
brane, that the rst derivative of h has to vanish at the location of the three-brane. this
condition also guarantees the hermiticity of the laplacian in the curved background (24).
it is obvious that there exists a massless mode

h0 = const.

(28)

that solves (24) and also has vanishing rst derivative at the position of the brane at
z = z1. moreover, it is normalizable in the interval z1  z < zmax, with measure dze3.
in the rest of this section we determine the spectrum of the massive graviton uctuations
for our two models.

3.1 model a

we rst determine the mass spectrum of graviton uctuations for non-zero m for the
model corresponding to a uniform distribution of d3-branes on a disc. in order to solve
the dierential equation we found it useful to change variable to

x =

u 2

u 2 + r2
0

=

1

cosh2(z/r)

,

0  x  x1 

1

cosh2(z1/r)

< 1 .

(29)

then the function hx(1q)/2 obeys a hypergeometric equation. hence, we can easily write
down the general solution for the graviton uctuations as

hq = nq(cid:16)eiq x(q1)/2fq(x) + eiq x(q+1)/2f

q(x)(cid:17) .

(30)

the constant q and the function fq(x) are related to the mass m and a particular
hypergeometric function as

fq(x)  f(cid:16)q  1

q  1
2
1  r2m 2 ,

q 

,

2

, 1 + q; x(cid:17) ,

(31)

8

where nq and q are real constants. the above solution takes the same form as that given
in [16], after using certain transformation properties of hypergeometric functions. the
coecients and the allowed values of m are now determined by requiring normalizability
and the appropriate boundary conditions. since x does not take values in the entire unit
interval, the hermiticity condition for the scalar laplace operator requires that

this determines the phase q as

xh|x=x1 = 0 .

(q + 1)f

e2iq =

q(x)  2xxf

(q  1)fq(x) + 2xxfq(x) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=x1

q(x)

note that q depends not only on the value of q, but also on the particular point x1. as
was shown in [16] (see also [15]) the parameter q in (31) is purely imaginary and therefore
there is a mass gap in the spectrum

(32)

(33)

.

mgap =

1
r

,

(34)

and, above it, there is a continuum with m  1/r. this follows from requiring or-
thonormalizability in the dirac sense (with the use of a -function). we also note that
the existence of a mass gap is most transparent if we transform the equation for the
graviton uctuations h(z) into a schrodinger equation by means of the transformation
h(z) = e3/2(z)

with potential

(35)

(36)

v (z) =

2(z) + 3(z1)(z  z1) .

in our case, using (5), we obtain

v (z) =

(z  z1) ,

(37)

which is a particular member of the class of potentials known in the literature as poschl
teller potentials of type ii. clearly, since v (z  ) = 1/r2, there is a minimum value
for m 2 given by (34). note also that the value of the mass gap does not depend on the
particular location of the brane at z1. the reason is that the mass gap corresponds to
the asymptotic value of the potential for large z. the zero-mode wave function is

0(z) =

cosh1/2(z/r)
sinh3/2(z/r)

,

(38)

and is clearly normalizable in the interval z1  z < . of course it corresponds to (28)
after we multiply with the factor e3/2.

rpq(q + 1) ,

(41)

3.2 model b

let us now turn to the case of the model corresponding to d3-branes uniformly dis-
tributed over a three-sphere. in order to solve the dierential equation (27) with (7) we
found it useful to change variable to

x = 1 

r2
0
u 2 = cos2(z/r) ,

0  x  x1  cos2(z1/r) < 1 .

(39)

then the function (1 x)2h obeys a hypergeometric equation. the general solution for
the graviton uctuations that is regular at x = 0 is given by

hq = nq(1  x)2f (q + 2,q + 1, 1; x) ,

(40)

where nq is a normalization constant and the real number q parametrizes the mass m as
rpq(q + 1). the hermiticity condition for the scalar laplace operator is equivalent
m = 2
to the condition (32) for the derivative of the graviton wave function. this determines
the massive spectrum as

where q belongs to a discrete set of real numbers that can be taken to be positive with no
loss of generality. hence, as in the case of the previous model, there exists a mass gap,
corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue for q, separating the massless graviton mode from
the massive spectrum.2 as before we may cast our eigenvalue problem into an equivalent
schrodinger problem. the corresponding potential is given by (36) after we use (7)

v (z) =

r2(cid:18)1

+

15

4 sin2(z/r)(cid:19) 

2
r

2 + cos(2z1/r)

sin(2z1/r)

(z  z1) .

(42)

similarly to (37), it is a particular member of the class of potentials known in the litera-
ture as poschlteller potentials of type i. the zero-mode wave function for the potential
(42) is given by

0(z) =

cos1/2(z/r)
sin3/2(z/r)

,

(43)

which is normalizable in the interval z1  z < r/2. of course it corresponds to (28)
after we multiply it by the factor e3/2. the schrodinger dierential equations for the
potentials (37) and (42) are related by the analytic continuation z  iz, as expected
from a similar relation between the corresponding supergravity backgrounds.

in general the wave functions (40) are not orthogonal for dierent values of q and in
addition they overlap with the massless constant mode h0. in principle it is straightfor-

2for z1 = 0.972r (equivalently x1 = 0.318) we have e(z1) = 1 and the rst few eigenvalues are
q = 2.74, 5.24, 8.00, 10.6 . . . as the brane position z1 moves closer to z = 0 (equivalently x = 1) the
corresponding eigenvalues move towards the set of positive integers (see (44) and (45) below). hence,
the mass gap corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue for q is insensitive, for all practical purposes, to the
position of the brane.

numerical methods. there are, however, two particular choices for the position of the
brane that lead to a great mathematical simplication and make the physical picture
more transparent. in the rst case, consider x1  1. this corresponds to z1  r as in
case ii discussed in subsection 2.1. in this case, (40) (with q a positive integer) is related
to jacobi polynomials. the complete set of mutually orthogonal massive graviton wave
functions that are normalized to 1 is practically the same as the one found in [16], where
x1 = 1 exactly. they read

hn =r 2(2n + 1)

r

(1  x)2p (2,0)

n1 (2x  1) ,

0  x  1 ,

n = 1, 2, . . . ,

(44)

where p (2,0)
tremely good approximation, given by

2n1 are the appropriate jacobi polynomials. the mass spectrum is, to an ex-

mn =

2

rpn(n + 1) ,

n = 1, 2, . . . .

(45)

another case where jacobi polynomials arise is for x1 = 1/2 (which corresponds to
z1 = r/4  0.785r and e(z1) = 21/3  1.26). note that for this choice of the brane
location we are eectively discussing a parameter choice similar to that made in case i
in subsection 2.1. here, the set of real numbers q in (40) coincides with the set of even
integers. it turns out that the complete set of mutually orthogonal massive graviton wave
functions that are normalized to 1 is

hn = 2r 4n + 1

r

(1  x)2p (2,0)

2n1(2x  1) ,

n = 1, 2, . . . ,

(46)

whereas the mass spectrum is given by

mn =

4

rpn(n + 1/2) ,

n = 1, 2, . . . .

(47)

the set of eigenfunctions (46) is by itself complete and all of its members are orthogonal
(with respect to the usual inner product) to the constant massless mode. the same of
course is true for (44).

4 the newton law

the fact that we have modelled our at four-dimensional space-time as a brane embedded
in a ve-dimensional curved space-time, has certain consequences for the newton law
that governs the gravitational attraction of point particles in our four-dimensional world.
present-day experimental data do not exclude corrections to the 1/r2 attractive force for
distances smaller than or equal to 1 mm. since our models are ve-dimensional at the
fundamental level, we should, at distances much smaller than r, have the newton law
in four spatial dimensions

,

(48)

v = 

g5m

r2
4

11

where r4 denotes the corresponding radial distance from a point mass m located at
the origin, and g5 is the newton constant in 4 + 1 dimensions. on the other hand,
for distances much larger than r, we should just obtain the usual newton law in three
spatial dimensions

g4m

v = 

r

,

(49)

where r is the usual radial distance in three spatial dimensions and g4 is the newton
constant in 3 + 1 dimensions. the crossover behaviour between (48) and (49) depends on
the details of the particular model used. in particular, in view of possible experimental
verications, we are interested in computing exponential corrections to the leading-order
behaviour of the newton potential (49). at this point we emphasize again the importance
of the existence of a mass gap in our models, as this will govern the behaviour of the
leading yukawa-type correction to (49).3

at the linearized level the gravitational potential in 4+1 dimensions with curved

metric given by (3) obeys the following equation in four spatial dimensions

3v + 2
2

z v + 3

d(z)

dz

zv = 42mg5

(3)(x)(z  z1)

e3

.

(50)

this is nothing but (25), after we include a source term, due to a point particle of mass
m located at the brane and at the origin of our three-dimensional spatial world. the
normalization in the right-hand side of (50) is chosen such that for small distances the
potential is v =  g5m
r2+(zz1)2 , in accordance with (48). we have also dropped the time
dependence since we are seeking static solutions. we may expand v in terms of the
complete basis of eigenfunctions {hq} of the operator 2
vq(r)hq(z) ,

z + 3d(z)/dz z as

(51)

v =xq

where the sum over q comprises the massless as well as the massive modes. the general
solution can be written formally as

with

v (r) = 

g5m

r xq,p
kqp =z zmax

z1

emqrk 1

qp hq(z1)hp (z1) ,

dze3(z)hq(z)hp (z) ,

(52)

(53)

with zmax =  and r/2 for the case of our models (a) and (b). we have omitted the
internal space dependence since all point particles are at z1 with respect to our four-
dimensional space-time. in general, we may assume that we have an orthonormal system
of eigenfunctions {hq}. then (52) becomes

3 the model in [3], based on the ads5, has a continuous spectrum with no mass gap, and the
corrections to newtons law are power-like. they can be made extremely small when the curvature of
the ve-dimensional space-time is of planck size [3].

the factor dq(z1) in (54) weights the contributions of the various massive kaluzaklein

our examples (30) and (40). however, we may easily deduce that the general form of the
newton potential, with the leading correction included, will be

v (r)  

g4m

r

(cid:0)1 + (r)er/(cid:1) ,

(56)

where the range  of the yukawa correction is related to the mass gap. the strength
of the force (r) could itself be a function of the distance r, as indicated, provided that
the spectrum above the mass gap is continuous. however, if the spectrum is discrete the
strength is just a constant. for the case of our examples we may show that

and

model (a) :

 = r ,

r(cid:19)2
(r) = const.(cid:18)r

,

model (b) :

  r ,

(r) = const. ,

(57)

(58)

where both constants appearing in the previous expressions depend on the position of the
brane. for the choice of parameters in case i in subsection 2.1 both of these constants
are of order 1, resulting in a measurable contribution to the strength of the yukawa cor-
rection. unlike this case, for the choice of parameters in case ii in subsection 2.1 both
of these constants are extremely small due to the wave function suppression. hence,
the corresponding yukawa correction is negligible. we may demonstrate these dier-
ent behaviours using the two orthonormal sets of wave functions (46) and (44) as they
correspond to two extreme choices of the brane location.

for the special case of the orthonormal wave functions (46) with masses given by
(47), the explicit computation can be carried out without much eort using properties
of the jacobi polynomials. we nd that

v (r) =

(59)

4in fact (54) is very similar and extends the corresponding formulae proved in [18] for compactication
on general compact manifolds (for the case of a torus compactication, see also [20]). one apparent
dierence is that, in the corresponding formulae in [18], the degeneracy of the irreducible representations
of the symmetry group of the compact space appears instead of dq(z1). however, as shown in [18], this
degeneracy can be also written in terms of eigenfunctions of the scalar laplacian on the compact internal
space.

good approximation

in the opposite limit of small r we may approximate an in (59) by its value at innity,
i.e. an  a
= 2/. using also the relation 2g5 = rg4 (following from (55)) we

indeed obtain the potential corresponding to newtons law in four spatial dimensions:

v (r)  

g5m

for

r  r ,

(61)

as expected. the advantage of (59) is that the crossover behaviour from (61) to (60) is
expressed in a simple and precise way.

for the special case of the orthonormal wave functions (44) with masses given by (45)

we nd that

v (r) =

(62)

hence, we see that using (22) and (39) all corrections to newtons 1/r potential are
o(1066) and therefore negligible. as we have mentioned, this is due to the wave-function
suppression near x = 1.

5 discussion

in this paper we have considered models of our four-dimensional world in which a three-
brane is embedded in ve-dimensional backgrounds, which are solutions of gauged su-
pergravity with a boundary term. these backgrounds arise as consistent truncations
of solutions of type-iib string theory, which correspond to continuous distributions of
d3-branes on a disc or on a three-sphere. from the gauged supergravity point of view,
the ve-dimensional metrics are warped products of minkowski space in four dimensions
with an extra dimension. the interesting feature of our backgrounds is that the spectrum
of linearized graviton uctuations either has a genuine mass gap with a continuum above
it or it is discrete. furthermore, if the range of the fth coordinate is reduced by placing
a three-brane, a normalizable zero-mode appears, corresponding to the graviton in our
world while the mass gap is preserved. therefore, these models naturally lead to physics
that appears four-dimensional, as long as energies are smaller than the mass gap, and an
eective four-dimensional theory can be dened.

furthermore, we studied in detail the corrections of newtons law induced by the
massive excitations that are yukawa-like owing to the mass gap. we examined the

14

space of parameters, under the condition that supergravity is a good approximation, for
physically interesting scenarios. in one of them (case i in section 2.1) the fundamental
scale is between the planck and the electroweak energy scales and the radius of curvature
of the space is of millimetre size. in this case the corrections are close to the experimental
bounds and might be observed in future experiments; but still there exists a hierarchy,
which, however, is smaller than the usual 1016. in this range of parameters our models
resemble those in [4] with a single compactied large extra dimension. the other scenario
(case ii in section 2.1) has the attractive feature that the fundamental scale is actually
of the same order as the electroweak scale (unication) and it shares several features of
compactication with three large extra dimensions, although our models have only one.
the corrections to newtons law, however, turn out to be negligible, because of a wave
function suppression at the location of the three-brane. it would be very interesting to
nd models similar to the ones studied in this paper where the parameters can be chosen
such that the corrections are closer to the experimental bounds whereas the fundamental
scale can be of the order of tev, i.e. we have unication.

note added

while we were nishing up our paper, [21] appeared, where the idea that the model
of [2, 3] may correspond, with appropriate choice of parameters, to a direct product
compactication with one large extra dimension, was also pointed out.

a d3-branes distributions and gauged supergravity

the general ten-dimensional metric of an arbitrary distribution of parallel three-branes
in type iib string theory takes the following form

ds2 = h1/2dxdx + h 1/2(dr2 + r2d2

5) ,

,  = 0, 1, 2, 3 ,

(a.1)

where d2
5 denotes the line element for the ve-dimensional sphere and the function h
is a harmonic function on the six-dimensional space transverse to the brane. one of the
simplest examples is a stack of n coinciding branes in the near horizon limit: h = r4/r4
with r4 = 4gsnl4
s. in this case the background is ads5  s5, which plays a central
role in the ads/cft correspondence [10]. upon reduction on the ve-sphere, this yields
n = 8 gauged supergravity in ve dimensions on ads5. the authors of [2, 3] utilized
variants of this background by adding one or two three-branes, which cut o the fth
coordinate. in the full ads5 background, the gravity decouples from the four-dimensional
world but, once the fth coordinate does not run over the full range, gravity becomes
dynamical. the ads5 solution in the bulk preserves thirty-two supersymmetries and is
a stable background.

the metrics (a.1) with harmonic h corresponding to more general not-coinciding
three-branes provide a large class of interesting backgrounds for compactication, which
preserve sixteen supercharges. in the following we will concentrate on two backgrounds:

15

(a) d3-branes distributed uniformly over a disc and (b) d3-branes distributed uniformly
over a three-sphere. for (a) the metric can be written as [16]

ds2 =

r(r2 + r2

0 cos2 )1/2
r2

dxdx +

0 cos2 )1/2

r(r2 + r2

r2 + r2
0

+ d2(cid:17) + (r2 + r2

0) sin2 d2 + r2 cos2 d2

3(cid:19) , (a.2)

where d2
3 is the line element of the three-sphere, r0 is the radius of the disc and r  0.
the metric for the case (b) is obtained by taking r0  ir0 and restricting the range of
the radial coordinate r  r0.

these two ten-dimensional backgrounds can be consistently truncated to ve-dimensional

gauged supergravity. more technical details can be found in [15]. the situation can be
summarized as follows. the n = 8 gauged supergravity in ve dimensions contains
forty-two scalars, which have a non-trivial potential. there is a stationary point where
all scalars are zero (except for the complex coupling, which is a at direction of the po-
tential), which corresponds to the ads5  s5 background in ten dimensions. for general
d3-brane congurations the metric on s5 is deformed, the ten-dimensional space becomes
a warped product space and in the ve-dimensional perspective (some of) the forty-two
scalars develop non-trivial proles. it is widely believed that every ve-dimensional solu-
tion can be lifted unambiguously to ten dimensions, but a complete proof is still missing.
there exist privileged ows such that the scalars lie in a one-dimensional submanifold of
the forty-two scalars, which we will denote by a scalar . it was shown in [15] that these
solutions correspond to certain d3-brane distributions in ten dimensions  including our
two examples.

the relevant part of the bosonic action of the ve-dimensional gauged supergravity,

in  + + + + signature, is
