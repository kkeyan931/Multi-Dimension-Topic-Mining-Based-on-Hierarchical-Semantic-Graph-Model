we consider cosmological solutions of string and m-theory compactied to four dimen-

sions by giving a general prescription to construct four-dimensional modular cosmologies

with two commuting killing vectors from vacuum solutions. by lifting these solutions

to higher dimensions we analyze the existence of cosmological singularities and nd that,

in the case of non-closed friedmann-robertson-walker universes, curvature singularities

are removed from the higher-dimensional model when only one of the extra dimensions is

time-varying. by studying the moduli space of compactications of m-theory resulting in

homogeneous cosmologies in four dimensions we show that u-duality transformations map

singular cosmologies into non-singular ones.

1. introduction and motivation

it is well known that string physics has changed the way we now look at cosmology.

in particular, string theory leads to consider multidimensional cosmological scenarios in a

natural way, since superstrings can only be consistently quantized in ten dimensions. m-

theory has conrmed this trend extending cosmology to the realm of the eleventh dimension

(see for example [1]).

higher dimensional cosmology is not new. before the advent of string theory the

kaluza-klein paradigm had already put forward the idea that four-dimensional space-

time should not be something taken for granted in cosmology (a collection of the most

relevant articles on the subject can be found in [2]; see also [3]). in its original version,

the kaluza-klein program aimed to describe all four-dimensional matter elds as purely

gravitational (or supergravitational) degrees of freedom in 4 + n dimensions. although

this idea met serious obstacles when trying to account for the existence of chiral matter in

four dimensions [4], it has been partially incorporated in string theory where the presence

of ten-dimensional chiral matter fermions solves the problem.

when looking at the four-dimensional physics, the extra internal dimensions leave

their blueprints in the form of a plethora of massless scalar and vector elds. on general

grounds, the presence of these massless scalars poses a serious problem in trying to extract

realistic cosmological models from string theory. the situation is complicated by the fact

that most of these elds represent at directions of the superpotential that are not lifted

by quantum corrections as long as enough supersymmetry is preserved. in many ocassions,

however, the study is restricted to the simplest cosmological models by looking just at the

eects of the dilaton and tensor elds, for example, and ignoring the remaining moduli
elds altogether3 [5][6].

the ultimate motivation of string/m-theory cosmology is of course to solve the prob-

lem of cosmological singularities, explain the initial conditions in cosmology and the di-

mensionality of space-time. close to t = 0, quantum gravity eects become dominant and

hopefully will smear the semiclassical singularity, thus opening a new window to the study

3 from the m-theory perspective, on the other hand, the dilaton itself is just a moduli asso-
ciated with the compactication of the eleventh dimension. the reason to separate it from other

elds is that in the weakly coupled string limit of m-theory its compactication scale gss is much

smaller than the string scale s.

of the early universe. although a full quantum cosmology description of the early universe

is still missing, the semiclassical analysis supported by the use of stringy symmetries has

been useful in getting a avor of the physics close to the big-bang singularity [7][8]. on the

other hand, from a kaluza-klein perspective it is possible that the existence of the initial

singularity might just be the result of integrating out the physics associated with higher

dimensions [9][10] and that it could be removed already in the semiclassical approximation.

in this paper we will combine these two ideas and investigate the eect of extra dimen-

sions on the initial cosmological singularity by studying a family of friedmann-robertson-

walker (frw) cosmologies coupled to a number of scalar elds which we associate with
compactication moduli. we nd that in the particular case of open or at (k = 1, 0)
universes in which only one of the extra dimensions has a non-trivial dynamics, the big-

bang singularity might be just an artifact of the kaluza-klein reduction which may be

removed when going to higher dimensions. on the other hand, in the case of spatially

closed solutions (k = 1) the big-bang or the big-crunch singularity is postponed in the

higher-dimensional model, again when only one of the extra dimensions is time-varying. it

is interesting that by switching on more than one dynamical internal dimension the regu-

larization of curvature singularities is denitively spoiled in all cases. when interpreting,

in the open and at cases, this higher dimensional cosmologies as solutions in m-theory we

nd that the u-duality group g7 acts on the moduli space of metrics by relating singular

geometries with non-singular ones. this seems to indicate that a certain class of cosmo-

logical singularities in m-theory can be physically resolved in terms of an equivalent dual

regular background.

the plan of the article is the following: in the next section we will review the properties

of moduli elds arising from compactications of (4 + n )-dimensional einstein gravity on

a n -dimensional straight torus and provide a general algorithm to construct gowdy-type

cosmologies in the presence of moduli elds. we will apply in sec. 3 this algorithm to

generate modular frw cosmologies and, after undoing the kaluza-klein reduction, will

study the structure of singularities of the higher dimensional parent metric. in sec. 4 the

analysis will be focused on m-theory compactications to four dimensions and the action

of u-duality on the moduli space of solutions. finally, conclusions will be summarized in

sec. 5.

2. cosmologies coupled to scalar elds vs. dimensional reduction

2.1. scalar elds from dimensional reduction

scalar elds appear naturally in the old kaluza-klein program or its string/m-theory

versions. here, we will consider the dimensional reduction of a (4 + n )-dimensional metric
on an n -dimensional straight torus tn = (s1)n using the ansatz4

(2.1)

the metric functions i(x) ( = 0, . . . , 3) should be thought of as the components of the
metric in the internal n -dimensional torus. notice that this ansatz is invariant under the

permutation of the i elds.

from the four-dimensional point of view, the elds i(x) are scalars. their dynamical
equations are obtained by demanding that the (4+n )-dimensional metric (2.1) is a vacuum

solution of the einstein equations. writing the einstein-hilbert action for (2.1) we nd

that

leading to the result that the breathing modes of the higher dimensional metric appear as

mixed scalar in the four-dimensional action. to eliminate this mixing we may perform a

diagonalization in eld space by dening the new elds i through the relation

which is not an o(n ) transformation. the new scalar elds i will be propagation eigen-
states and there will be no classical mixing among those. their dynamics will be governed

(2.5)

in our analysis we have assumed that all scalar elds have a geometric origin as

moduli of dimensional reduction. this point of view is very much appropriate for m-

theory where the dilaton is on the same footing with all other scalar as compactication

moduli. nonetheless, in those regimes of m-theory that can be described in terms of a

weakly coupled string theory the dilaton eld plays a privileged role as the eld whose

vacuum expectation value determines the string coupling constant. in this case, dimen-

sional reduction from ten dimensions will produce again a number of scalar elds in the

lower-dimensional theory. the dynamics of those moduli can be extracted again from the

kaluza-klein ansatz

6

where now the ten-dimensional metric is no longer a vacuum solution of einstein equation

but rather a solution of dilaton gravity instead. the resulting four-dimensional action in

string frame is [13]

where the four-dimensional dilaton  is dened in terms of the ten-dimensional one as

(2.8)

we see from (2.7) that the kinetic term for the elds i is diagonalized in the four di-
mensional action, although it is conformally coupled to the dilaton eld. this conformal

coupling can be removed as usual by a conformal transformation of the metric. it is how-

ever when we re-express the four-dimensional dilaton in terms of the ten-dimensional one

via (2.8) that the mixing between the dierent i appears. in order to recover the result
from the compactication of a vacuum solution of m-theory (eq. (2.2) with n = 7) we

would need to lift the solution (2.6) of ten-dimensional dilaton gravity to a vacuum solution

in eleven dimensions.

2.2. four-dimensional modular cosmologies from vacuum solutions

in the following we will be interested in nding exact solutions to the eld equations

derived from the four-dimensional action (2.5), that we can write in the manifestly o(n )-

invariant form as

where we have dened

s =z d4xg(cid:2)r  2t (cid:3)

the matter energy-momentum tensor for (2.9) can be written as a sum of the corresponding
stress-energy tensors for each scalar eld5

t =

xi=1

t (i)

g t (cid:19) .

let us concentrate our attention on gowdy-type cosmologies with line element

ds2 = ef (t,z)(dt2 + dz2) + k(t, z)hep(t,z)dx2 + ep(t,z)dy2i .

(2.10)

(2.11)

at rst sight, the gowdy-type coordinates seem an unnecessary complication, since we will

be mostly dealing with cases where both geometries and scalar elds are homogeneous. the

telling point to use them, nevertheless, is that: i) the scalar eld equation are linear in the

metric functions. ii) the evolution of the transversal metric functions k(t, z) and p(t, z)

is decoupled from scalar eld dynamics, the longitudinal function f (t, z) being the only

one inuenced by the presence of the scalar elds. and iii) that due to the presence of

a six-parameter isometry group g6 which includes the three dimensional group g3 acting
simply transitively on the three-dimensional surfaces of constant curvature in frw models,

5 we have normalized the energy-momentum tensor in such a way that the einstein equations

are g = t.

5

the above line element, which has a g2 isometry group, naturally includes all three frw
geometries.

let f (t, z) = f (t, z)vac such that (2.11) is a solution of the einstein vacuum equations.

in this case the functions p(t, z) and k(t, z) satisfy the following conditions

and


t

[k(t, z) p(t, z)] 


z

[k(t, z)p(t, z)] = 0

k(t, z)  k(t, z) = 0.

the idea now is to solve einstein equations with the energy-momentum tensor (2.10). as

it happens with a single scalar eld (see for example [14]), the transverse part characterized

by the metric functions k(t, z) and p(t, z) will be left unchanged. on the other hand, the

longitudinal function f (t, z)vac is replaced by

f (t, z)vac  f (t, z)vac + f (t, z)sc

and the equations for f (t, z)sc can be written from the einstein equations as

f (t, z)sc =

f (t, z)sc =

2k

k2  k 2 (cid:16)k ttz  k ttt(cid:17)
k2  k 2 (cid:16)k ttt  k ttz(cid:17)

2k

where t are the components of the energy-momentum tensor. substituting (2.10) we
nally get

f (t, z)sc =

f (t, z)sc =

(2.12)

the structure of this expression (sum over each scalar eld) is the result of the fact that

einstein equations are linear in the energy-momentum tensor and the energy-momentum

tensor itself is a sum of the contributions from each scalar eld. expressions (2.12) are

invariant under the global o(n ) symmetry of (2.5), as one expects, since a rotation of the

elds by an element of this group does not modify the geometry. in addition, the scalar

elds i must satisfy the wave equation

eqs. (2.12) can be used to generalize the algorithm of generation of string cosmologies
given in ref. [6]. taking i = i (i = 1, . . . , 6) and 7 = , the four dimensional dilaton,
we generate exact solutions of the einstein equations with seven scalar elds that, after the
conformal transformation by e2 will provide us with solutions to the equations derived
from the string theory action (2.7). after this, we can further transform the resulting four-

dimensional metric by o(2, 2; r) [6] or sl(2, r) [15] to generate other elds, the moduli
i remaining invariant under these transformations.

in addition to this, we can use this generation technique to directly construct four-

dimensional modular cosmologies representing toroidal compactications of cosmological

solutions of m-theory. in the following, we will particularize our analysis to a certain class of

these cosmological solutions that render homogeneous cosmologies in four dimensions and

use them to study how four-dimensional physics can be regularized in eleven dimensions.
this family of solutions will also be useful to study the moduli space of m-theory on t7.

3. frw cosmologies with moduli elds

we will now apply what we have learnt to the construction of rolling moduli cosmolo-

gies in four dimensions [16]. we start with a vacuum solution and apply the algorithm

(2.12) with a collection of n time-dependent scalar elds of the form

i(t) = qi 0(t),

i = 1, . . . , n

(3.1)

with qi a n -tuple of real numbers and 0(t) a particular homogeneous solution to the wave
equation (2.13). the numbers {qi} play now the role of coordinates in the moduli space
of solutions. from (2.12) we get the following equations for f (t, z)sc

notice that in the family of solutions under consideration, the o(n ) global symmetry of
the einstein-klein-gordon action (2.5) acts linearly on the qis and that the numerical
prefactor in (3.2) is just the o(n )-invariant metric on the moduli space.

in the generic case, the resulting family of metrics will always have strong curvature

singularities at some values of the time coordinate t. in what follows we will study what

happens to these singularities from a higher-dimensional point of view, when we undo the

kaluza-klein reduction.

the solution coupled to the n scalar elds is

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

the interesting feature of these solutions is that the dynamics of the scalar elds is only
relevant at early times, saturating to a constant when t  . one would expect this sort
of behavior in realistic models for the modular elds in string/m-theory cosmology. the

scalar elds are supposed to play an important role in the evolution during the early epoch,

but are expected to be frozen at a certain vacuum expectation value after supersymmetry

breaking. from that time on, the dynamics of the universe is dominated by matter or

radiation.

the case with  = 1 is especially interesting, since we recover an open frw universe

n

(3.6)

it is straightforward to check that the metric (3.6) has a cosmological singularity at t = 0

where the curvature scalar blows up. actually, the physical properties of the singularity

are independent of the particular values qi take, as long as the condition (3.5) with  = 1

8

is satised. this is in accordance with the requirement of o(n ) global invariance of the

theory.

let us now re-construct the (4 + n )-dimensional theory from which (3.6) is being

obtained by dimensional reduction. here we have to keep in mind that the scalar elds

associated with the scale factors of the internal torus are related to a linear combination of

the original elds i(t), as shown above. this means that the higher dimensional metric
will be

(3.7)
where we have introduced the new constants pi = dijqj , with dij the matrix (2.4). we
can now rewrite the condition  = 1 in terms of the new moduli space coordinates {pi} as

 

n

xi=1

(3.8)

the new parameters just provide a non-orthogonal system of coordinates in moduli space.

actually we see from (3.7) that the pis can be thought of as a kind of kasner exponents
in the n -dimensional internal torus when t  0.

the metric (3.7) with  = 1 is a vacuum solution of einstein equations in 4 + n

dimensions (in fact it is such for any ). naively, the singularity seems to be at t = 0 ,

as it was in the original four-dimensional space-time. however, it may happen that this

apparent singularity is just the result of choosing a singular coordinate system. to clarify
this, we can evaluate the square of the riemann curvature tensor rabcdrabcd, which is
non-vanishing, in the t  0 limit

rabcdrabcd  c(pi)t2(s3) + o[t2(s2)]

(3.9)

where we have written s =pn

c(pi) =

first, let us notice that s  3 < 3 so the leading term in (3.9) will always diverge at
t  0 limit. thus, in general, we will have curvature singularities in 4 + n dimensions in

xi=1

9

this limit. however, we nd the surprising result that whenever pi = 1, pj = 0 (j 6= i)
c(pi) = 0 and actually the curvature invariant is regular for all times and given by6

rabcdrabcd =

18

cosh8 t

.

(3.10)

this corresponds to having only one dynamically non-trivial cycle whose scale factor evolve

with time. in the four dimensional metric, on the other hand, due to the non-diagonal
relation between {pi} and {qi}, in general all scalar elds will have a non-trivial dynamics.
note, however, that the dimensionally reduced model (3.4) is generally inhomogeneous for

generic , the regular higher-dimensional solution falling into a homogeneous and isotropic

class. one might wonder whether higher-dimensional regularity and lower-dimensional

isotropy are physically linked somehow.

3.2. closed frw

we now pass to discuss a four-dimensional metric with closed spatial sections. the

vacuum seed metric is obtained from (3.3) by replacing hyperbolic functions by their

trigonometric counterparts. we again couple the space-time to n scalar elds of the form

(3.1) now with

0(t) =

3
2

log tan t.

imposing as before  = 1, we are left with the family of four-dimensional metrics

the coordinate transformation from the standard closed frw metric to (3.11) are given in

the appendix of ref. [14], the coordinates z, x and y used here being just euler angles for
s3. in spite of the similarities with the at case, the structure of cosmological singularities
is now richer. studying the scalar curvature r we nd that the metric (3.11) has curvature
6 actually, it is easy to realize that, provided this curvature invariant is nite, so are all other
scalars constructed from contractions of any number of riemann tensors. in our case this follows
from the fact that r1
dimension w1.

a;1b is nite when t  0, where the index 1 denotes the dynamical internal

singularities at t =

from a big-bang singularity at t =  into a big-crunch at t = (2 + 1)

in going to 4 + n dimensions, we get

(3.12)

where the same denition for the pi as in sec. 3.1, satisfying the condition (3.8), has been

used. from inspection of (3.12) we might be tempted to infer that the higher dimensional

theory will be singular again when t =  
2 . computing the curvature invariant when
t  0+ we get eq. (3.9), as in the previous case. however if we now compute the same
invariant close to the big-crunch singularity (t  

2 ) we nd

rabcdrabcd  c(pi)t2(s+3) + o[t2(s2)].

the situation is somewhat dierent as compared to the open case. there we found that

when the condition  = 1 is saturated by a single pi = 1, the initial big-bang singularity

disappears altogether by going to higher dimensions. here we nd that we do not get rid

of all curvature singularities, but only of half of them. the resulting geometry in this

case in only singular when t = 

2 (2 + 1), whereas those at t =  are smeared in 4 + n
dimensions. the curvature invariant now is given by (3.10) with the hyperbolic cosine

replaced by a trigonometric one. the reverse situation happens when we take pi = 1 and
pj = 0 (j 6= 0): we avoid singularities located at t = 
2 (2 + 1), the geometry being the
same as for the previous case but now with t  t + 
2 .

in ref. [10] a similar situation was noticed for a closed frw cosmology that could be

resolved into a ve-dimensional black hole interior with just one curvature singularity in

the past or in the future. the dierence with the model analyzed here is that in the case

at hand our higher-dimensional universe still has a nite life, although it is doubled with

respect to the one of the four-dimensional geometry.

3.3. flat frw

finally, let us briey analyze the case of cosmological models with at spatial sections.

the four-dimensional metric and scalar elds system is given by

using the denition of the kasner exponents in terms of the original pi it is possible to
check that the only case in which we will have a regular geometry at t = 0 will again occur if

12

pi = 1 with all other pj (j 6= i) vanishing. in this case the resulting metric is at. actually
it can be seen to be (4 + n )-dimensional minkowski space-time in rindler coordinates7.

the non-trivial topology of the internal dimensions will hinder global identication of the

manifold with static minkowski solution.

4. m-theory connections

let us particularize the study of the cosmological models of the previous section to

the case with n = 7 in which they can be interpreted as four-dimensional cosmologies
arising from a compactication of m-theory on t7 = (s1)7 with vanishing three-form. in

describing the moduli space of cosmological solutions coupled to scalar elds of the form

(3.1) we have two dierent possibilities. in the four-dimensional theory it seems natural

to take the coordinates qi (i = 1, . . . , 7) which characterize the seven independent scalar

elds coupled to gravity. due to the global o(7) symmetry of the low-energy action, there

is a natural choice for the moduli space metric

i4 =

q2
i .

7

xi=1

the resulting geometry will only depend on qi through the quadratic form i4 as seen in

equation (3.2).

on the other hand, in eleven dimensional language it seems more appropriate to
change coordinates in moduli space and use instead of {qi} the new parameters {pi} which
determine the scale factors of the internal compactied dimensions and are related to the
original coordinates by a non-orthogonal linear transformation, pi = dijqj .
express the moduli space metric in the new coordinates, we nd8

(4.1)

7 in ref. [9] an inverse procedure was evoked by dimensionally reducing from a ve-dimensional
at model to four dimensions to argue that the cosmological singularity could be an artifact of

dimensional reduction.

8 since we are just performing a change of coordinates, i4 = i11. we will use however dierent

notation to indicate the coordinates used to write the quadratic form.

13

incidentally, this moduli space metric is the same as the one obtained in [8] (see also

[17]) for the compactications of m-theory on a seven-torus with am np = 0 using group
theoretical considerations. the o(7) global symmetry will act linearly on the pis leaving
i11 invariant. it is however important to notice that the eleven-dimensional geometry do
transform under o(7), in contrast to the four-dimensional one that was a singlet under the

action of this group. in eleven dimensions the only transformations that leave invariant

the space-time metric are permutations of the pis, which generates the weyl subgroup of
the mapping class group of the seven dimensional torus, sl(7, z).

we will consider the family of m-theory metrics obtained by taking n = 7 in (3.7).

these line elements are vacuum solution of eleven-dimensional supergravity everywhere

in the submanifold of the moduli space dened by i11 = 1. we can ask now about the
action on this metric of g7  weyl[e7(7)(z)], the subgroup of u-duality transformations
preserving the straight torus t7 = (s1)7 and the vanishing of the three-form [17][8], which
is generated by permutations of the pis and the so-called 2/5 transformation

with s = p1 + p2 + p3. it is easy to show that g7 leaves invariant the bilinear form i11
and it is thus a discrete nite subgroup of o(7) connecting physically equivalent m-theory

vacua.

in the following we will restrict our analysis to the open frw metric of sec. 3.1

although most of our results can be extended to the at case as well. acting with the
elements of g7 on the dierent solutions characterized by {pi} we can look how sensitive
m-theory physics is to the semiclassical geometry. the most striking fact we nd is that

the u-duality group maps solutions with a big-bang initial singularity into geometries that

are regular for all values of the cosmic time. for example, the metric

which is singular at t = 0 (rabcdrabcd  t16/3) can be mapped by g7 into one of the
non-singular m-theory cosmologies using the following sequence of permutations and 2/5

we have concluded that using an u-duality transformation, which is an exact symmetry

of m-theory, we can transform a singular background into a non-singular one. the ob-

vious bottom line seems to be that, at least in the low-energy limit, m-theory physics is

insensitive to a certain class of cosmological singularities.

in the case of the open (k = 1) solution, however, the asymptotic form of the metrics
at large times is to a great extend left invariant by the action of g7. the general feature
of all solutiones (3.7) when t   is that the open three dimensional space-time inates
while the internal torus reach a constant volume, namely

vol3d
volt7   3,

with  the co-moving time. physically, what we have is a cosmological solution that

evolves from an eleven-dimensional regime in which all scale factors are of the same size

into an asymptotic state with describes a large four-dimensional expanding universe and

a small static seven-dimensional torus (cf. [18][19]).

in the case of the at solution, on the other hand, the large-time behavior of the

metric is not universal. as we saw in sec. 3.3, in this case we can rewrite the metric in
the kasner form (3.15) with exponents given by (3.16). the u-duality group g7 acts on
these exponents in a rather complicated way through the transformation of the moduli
space coordinates {pi} (cf.
i=1 pi is not invariant under the 2/5
transformation, the asymptotic form of the metrics (3.14) or (3.15) will be sensitive to

[8]). since the sum p7

rotations by elements of the u-duality group. in addition to this, the internal manifold

will not remain small in general. we will have the usual behavior of any kasner universe,

with at least one contracting direction and a number of expanding ones.

the main characteristic of the non-singular m-theory cosmologies that we have ob-

tained is that in all cases there is only one time-varying coordinate, while the remaining

ones are constant during the evolution of the universe. in trying to make a string the-

ory interpretation of such solutions it seems natural to identify the dynamical coordinate

with the eleventh dimension associated with the dilaton eld. if we do so and perform a
dimensional reduction of the open (k = 1) regular eleven-dimensional solution down to
ten dimensions, the resulting metric and dilaton in string frame are9

which corresponds to a string background with three open spatial dimensions and an-

other six compactied on a torus whose dynamics is characterized by a global breathing

mode (a situation extensively studied in the kaluza-klein and string cosmology literature
[20][7][16]). the geometry is singular when t  0 but, on the other, at large times we
nd again an inating three-dimensional space together with a frozen internal torus, now

also with a constant dilaton. notice, however, that m-theory u-duality maps these kind

of singular string cosmologies into the regular ones that are obtained by identifying the

dilaton eld with one of the static circles. these transformations involve the interchange

of the dilaton with other moduli elds and thus are intrinsically non-perturbative from the

point of view of string theory.

incidentally, let us remark that because of the invariance of i11   under o(7), the
family of solutions (3.4) is stable under the u-duality group which thus maps solutions into

solutions (cf.

[8]). this is what one should expect, since g7 is a symmetry of m-theory

on a straight torus with a vanishing three-form.

5. concluding remarks

in this paper we have been concerned with four-dimensional cosmologies that arise

from the compactication of string/m-theory on a straight torus. we have given a general

algorithm to generate these modular cosmologies in four dimensions with two commuting

isometries. using this technique we have also constructed frw metrics and observed
that, although they are singular in four dimensions, in the open (k = 1) and at (k = 0)
cases their lifted higher-dimensional vacuum images have a regular curvature invariant
rabcdrabcd. in the case of closed frw cosmologies (k = 1), singularities are not removed
but the lifetime of the higher-dimensional universe (i.e. the time elapsed from the big-bang

to the big-crunch) is twice that of their four-dimensional versions.

it is important to stress, however, that in general the homogeneous character of the

scale factors of the extra dimensions derived from (3.1) does not ensure the homogeneity

of the reduced four-dimensional cosmology. given the absence of a singularity-free higher-

dimensional parent cosmology for the four-dimensional inhomogeneous solutions, it is

remarkable that the regularity condition for the space-time in higher dimensions translates

itself into isotropy of the four-dimensional solution. thus, the initially isotropic universe

16

could be naturally chosen by the requirement of regularity of the higher-dimensional space-

time.

we have also studied four-dimensional modular cosmologies related to toroidal com-

pactications of string/m-theory. in the case of m-theory on a straight seven-torus with

vanishing three form we have found open and at singular metrics that can be rotated

into regular ones by the elements of the u-duality group g7, thus indicating that the

physics of a certain class of singular universe can be described in terms of a dual regular

geometry. in the case of homogeneous open universes, however, the large time asymptotic

behavior of the metric is insensitive to the action of g7. in all cases we nd an inat-
ing three-dimensional space with k = 1 and an internal torus whose size asymptotically
reaches a constant value. it is remarkable that u-duality is able to relate geometries with

such a dierent behavior near t = 0 without modifying the dynamics of the universe at

large times. incidentally, this stabilization of the internal dimensions is produced by the

presence of the positive spatial curvature and it is absent in the case of the at solutions.

because of the o(7) invariance of the dimensionally reduced cosmologies, all the
eleven-dimensional metrics labeled by {pi} and the same value of i11 will produce ex-
actly the same geometry in four-dimensions, although it will be coupled to scalar elds

with dierent amplitudes in each case. in particular, using the classical symmetry of the

four dimensional action any solution in our family with i4 = 1 can be rotated into one with

a regular higher-dimensional parent metric. however, since m-theory in this background

is not invariant under the full group o(7), one expects that quantum eects will break this

global symmetry down to the u-duality group g7 which preserves the lattice of charges.

the situation is completely analogous to the classical invariance of the four-dimensional

eective action under o(6, 6; r) [13], a symmetry that is broken down to the t-duality

group o(6, 6; z) by string eects.

finally, it would be interesting to check whether our results can be extended to com-

pactications of m-theory on a generic seven-torus with a non-vanishing three form. from

our analysis it is clear at least that there will be solutions of this kind that can be trans-

formed into non-singular universes by u-duality, as can be seen by acting on the regular

metric with the borel generators of e7(7)(z) [12].
