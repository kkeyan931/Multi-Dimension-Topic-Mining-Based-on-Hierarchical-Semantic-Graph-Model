abstract

following our previous paper (hep-th/9909027), we generalize a supersymmet-
ric boundary state so that arbitrary conguration of the gauge eld coupled to the
boundary of the worldsheet is incorpolated. this generalized boundary state is
brst invariant and satisfy the non-linear boundary conditions with non-constant
gauge eld strength. this boundary state contains divergence which is identical
with the loop divergence in a superstring  model. hence vanishing of the  func-
tion in the superstring  model corresponds to a well-dened boundary state with
no divergence. the coupling of a single closed superstring massless mode with mul-
tiple open string massless modes is encoded in the boundary state, and we conrm
that derivative correction to the d-brane action in this sector vanishes up to the
rst non-trivial order o(2). combining t-dualities, we incorpolate also general
congurations of the scalar elds on the d-brane, and construct boundary states
representing branes stuck to another d-brane, with use of bion conguration.

1 introduction

rrecent developmernt on d-branes in string theories is owing in some part to the analysis of
the boundary state [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. this ingredient is eective to describe boundary of string
worldsheet, especially when it is studied in the ordinary parturbative approach of closed string
conformal eld theory. the boundary state itself has been developped to formulate string
loop corections to the eective equations of motion of string theory in relation to the fischler-
susskind mechanism [1, 2, 3]. in most of the works concerning the boundary state, only the
constant gauge eld strength was taken into account as its boundary degree of freedom, since
in that case the boundary conditions which coordinate elds on the worldsheet satisfy become
linear, hence explicitly one can construct the eigen state of the equations of the boundary
conditions.

the d-brane era initiated by polchinski [7] opened new directions on the use of the bound-
ary state. since this state species the couplings between d-brane dynamical degrees of
freedom and closed string excitations, the state is useful for deriving dynamics and eective
actions of the d-branes [8, 9]. the d-brane actions have been indicative of various dualities in
string theories [10]. however, as mentioned above, these d-brane actions are obtained in only
the leading order estimation with respect to the derivatives acting on the degrees of freedom
on the d-branes. the derivative corrections may ruin the intriguing properties which the
d-brane actions possess, and hence a systematic approach to evaluate higher orders of the
d-brane actions and the boundary states are needed [11, 12, 13].

in this paper, we extend our previous result in ref. [14] to the superstring case. we
construct in superstring theory a generalized boundary state which incorporates whole degrees
of freedom of the boundary-coupled background elds, which are the gauge elds and scalar
elds on the d-brane. this boundary state is brst invariant and reduces to the previously
known form when taking the limit to the constant eld strength. this may give a gleam of
hope to understand string dualities to all order.

this generalization of the boundary state leads us to an interesting application. some
congurations of gauge theories on the d-branes describe branes ending on branes [15] and
bound states of branes [16]. especially, classical congurations in born-infeld theory, which is
a part of the d-brane action, have been extensively studied [17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. we shall give
a basis of the boundary state description of these bion congurations or other nontrivial
congurations of the d-branes.

this paper is organized as follows. in sec. 2, we obtain a supersymmetric extension of the
generalized boundary state given in our previous paper [14] in which in the bosonic string

1

theory a boundary gauge eld (in particular, non-constant modes of the eld strength) was
incorporated to the boundary state. we treat type ii superstring theory in this paper. after
checking the brst invariance of the generalized boundary state, in sec. 3 we evaluate the

divergence immanent in this state within the approximation of at most two-derivatives acting
on the eld strength. this divergence is found to be identical with the superstring  model
loop divergence, hence the vanishing of the  function in the string  model side corresponds to
a well-dened boundary state with no divergence. then with use of this well-dened state we
nd that there is no nite correction to the d-brane action upto this order o(2) in the sector
of the coupling linear in massless colsed string mode. this result is in contrast to the bosonic
string case [14], in which nite corrections exist. in sec. 4, utilizing t-duality transformation

we introduce scalar elds into the boundary state, and then apply our boundary state to the
bion conguration. we see that the spike part of the bion actually describes the stirng
stuck to the d-brane.

2 generalized supersymmetric boundary state

as mentioned in the introduction, most aspects of the d-branes are concerning supersymmetry
and their bps properties. hence the low energy eective actions of the d-branes are desirable
to be studied in a supersymmetric fashion.
in this section, we apply the idea developped
in our previous papar [14] to superstring theory and construct a generalized supersymmetric
boundary state, incorporating the non-constant gauge eld strength on the d-brane. the
scalar eld which also exists on the d-brane shall be treated later in sec. 4.

2.1 review of the generalized boundary state

first let us summarize the denition and the relevant properties of the generalized boundary
state with the non-constant eld strength in bosonic string theory [14]. in the case of constant

gauge eld strength f, the boundary state(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(b)(f )e is dened as an eigen state of the linear

boundary conditions for open bosonic strings [1, 2, 4]:

x i()(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(b)(f )e = 0,
(p() + fx ())(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(b)(f )e = 0,
c()(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(b)(f )e = c()(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(b)(f )e = 0.

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

the index i species the directions transverse to the d-brane, while the greek indices , 

run in the longitudinal directions. the superscript (b) denotes that this is for the bosonic

when the front factor is put in this form (2.8), this boundary state can be rewritten in a form
in which the dependence on the gauge eld is simply arranged :

part. the brst invariance of this boundary state is a consequence of eqs. (2.1)  (2.3). the

oscillator representation of (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(b)(f )e reads

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(b)(f )e = 

tp

where three factors of kets |bn(f )i,|bdi and |bghi are for satisfying (2.1), (2.2) and (2.3)
respectively. these are given by

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(b)(f )e = exp(cid:18) i

2i d x fx (cid:19) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(b)(f = 0)e .

in ref. [14], we have generalized this boundary state to the one with general conguration

of the gauge eld, using the properties of the star product (three-string interaction vertex) in
a string eld theory. the denition of this generalized boundary state is

with

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(b)(cid:16)a(x)(cid:17)e  u[a] (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(b)(f = 0)e ,

u[a]  exp(cid:18)i

(2.10)

(2.11)

one observes that, for the constant eld strength, the generalized boundary state (2.10) is
reduced to the previous one (2.9). this boundary (2.10) state is subject to the following

non-linear boundary condition in the transverse directions

(cid:20)p + f(x)x (cid:21)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(b)e = 0,

3

(2.12)

in addition to the usual dirichlet boundary conditions x i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(b)e = 0. note that in eq. (2.12),

the eld strength can be general, not only constant. furthermore, we can show that this |bi
is brst invariant,

with use of the boundary conditions above.

qb(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(b)e = 0,

2.2 supersymmetric extension

(2.13)

in the neveu-schwarz-ramond (ns-r) formulation of superstring theory, worldsheet fermions
and superghosts are introduced in addition to the contents in bosonic string theory. in this
paper we shall not mention the superghost part in the boundary state explicitly, since this is

not concerned with the gauge eld conguration.

in the absence of non-trivial gauge eld on the boundary, the fermionic boundary conditions
for the superstring worldsheet are (+ i) = 0 in the directions tangential to the d-brane,
and (+i)i = 0 for the transverse directions [1, 2, 4]. the sign  is the spin structure, and

we leave it undetermined.1 therefore the fermionic sector of the boundary state(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(f )(cid:16)a(x)(cid:17)e

should satisfy

the explicit oscillator representation of this eigen state is

(+  i)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(f )(a = 0)e = (+  i)i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(f )(a = 0)e = 0.
r i)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(f )

0 e is the fermionic zero mode part which exists only in the r-r sector. it is given

r ) exp(ixr>0

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(f )(a = 0)e = exp(ixr>0

now, dene the fermionic part of the generalized boundary state as

1our result on the correction to the d-brane action does not refer to the spin structure as well as other

ne structures such as gso projections.

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(f )(cid:16)a(x)(cid:17)e  u[f ](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(f )(a = 0)e

(2.16)

(2.17)

where the unitary operator u[f ]  exp r is given by

r 

1

8i d(+  i)(+  i)f[x].

(2.18)

from the denition, this boundary state incorporates general conguration of the gauge eld
strength and evidently gauge invariant. since the operator u[f ] is subject to the following

relation

u[f ](+  i)u[f ]1 = (+  i)  f 

[x](+  i),

(2.19)

then for the general background we obtain the non-linear boundary condition for the tangential
directions as

(cid:20)(+  i)  f 

[x](+  i)(cid:21)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(f )(cid:16)a(x)(cid:17)e = 0.

(2.20)

this boundary condition is actually the one given in ref. [24], from the supersymmetrization
of the boundary coupling in the string  model.

combining this fermionic part with the bosonic part in the previous subsection, the total
unitary operator becomes u  u[a]u[f ]. since we have introduced general x dependence in
the fermionic unitary operator u[f ], the boundary condition for the bosonic part (2.12) may
be changed. actually, using the relation

[p, r] = i
8

(+  i)(+  i) 

x  f[x],

(2.21)

we have

u[a]u[f ](p)u[f ]1u[a]1
i
= p + f[x]x  
8

f[x](+  i)(+  i),

(2.22)

thus the boundary condition seems to be modied by the third term on the right hand side

(rhs). however, this is not the case. dierentiating eq. (2.20) by x, this third term propor-
tional to f vanishes on the fermionic part of the boundary state. therefore we summarize
the boundary conditions as

(cid:20)p + f[x]x (cid:21)|bi = 0,
(cid:20)(+  i)  f 

[x](+  i)(cid:21)|bi = 0,

where we have dened the complete boundary state as

|bi (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(b)e (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(f )e .

5

(2.23)

(2.24)

(2.25)

whole of the boundary conditions agree with the string  model approach [24].

this boundary state exhibits worldsheet supersymmetry as in the following. the string

worldsheet attached to the d-brane possesses two supersymmetries with respect to the right
and left movers : for the fermions,

m

 = (   )x m +,

m

+ = ( +  )x m ,

(2.26)

where two epsilons denote the parameters of the worldsheet supersymmetry transformation.

the boundary property is encoded in the boundary conditions, hence substituting the bound-
ary condition for x (2.23) into the above transformation results in



 = (1  f [x])
if one adopts the identication

x +,



+ = (1 + f [x])

x .

 = i+,

(2.27)

(2.28)

then under this supersymmetry transformation the fermionic boundary condition (2.24) is
shown to be left intact (for verifying this, one should use the fact that the third term on the
rhs of eq. (2.22) vanishes on the boundary state). this suitable identication (2.28) means

that this generalized boundary state (2.25) preserves half of the supersymmetries.

of course when the eld strength is constant, the generalized boundary state (2.25) repro-

duces the usually utilized boundary state. for the bosonic sector of the boundary state, this
is checked in ref. [14]. for the fermionic part, exponentiating the linear operator r (2.18), we

have an explicit form of the boundary state which is written only by creation operators as

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(f )(f )e = n (f )(f ) exp(ixr>0

b()
r o 

 b(+)

r )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(f )

0 (f )e  |bsuperghosti .

in the r-r sector, the fermionic zero mode is modied and depends on the constant eld
strength as

the normalization factor n (f )(f ) is given by

4

0 (f )e  exp(cid:18)1
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(f )
n (f )(f ) =( 1

(det(1 + f ))(0)

f(cid:19) ii |0;i .

(for the ns-ns sector),
(for the r-r sector).

this resultant form coincides with the one given in ref. [2].

(2.30)

(2.31)

2.3 brst invariance of the boundary state

the annihilation of the brst operator on the boundary state is important for the string loop
correction to the equation of motion in superstring theory [1]. in this subsection we show that

the generalized boundary state constructed in the previous section is indeed brst invariant.

the brst charge is composed of relevant two terms in addition to the pure ghost sector

as

qb = q(l)

b + q(f )

b + (ghost sector),

where

q(l)

b x xn

ncn, q(f )
l,b

b x xn

f ,b

n n,

(2.32)

(2.33)

and we see the vanishing of these two operators q(l)
term q(l)

b , there is a representation

b and q(f )

b

respectively. for the former

q(l)

b = 2i (cid:20)ic {  } + c(cid:26)2pm x m 

1
2

(++ + )(cid:27)(cid:21) .

(2.34)

the rst term in the integrand disappears due to the ghost boundary condition c = 0. in
addition, the boundary state with a = 0 satises the following boundary conditions

pm x m |b(a = 0)i = 0,
(++ + ) |b(a = 0)i = 0,

thus the relations to be veried for the vanishing of q(l)

b are

[pm x m , u]|b(a = 0)i = 0,

(++ + ) u[f ](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(f )(a = 0)e = 0.

the action of the operator in eq. (2.37) is evaluated as

(2.35)

(2.36)

(2.37)

(2.38)

[pm x m , u] = [pm x m , u[a]]u[f ] + u[a][pm x m , u[f ]].

(2.39)

the rst term on the rhs vanishes due to the antisymmetric nature of the indices of f (as in

ref. [14]). the second term on the rhs is zero on (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(f )(a = 0)e, because of the same reason

as that the third term of eq. (2.22) vanishes. for eq. (2.38), noting a decomposition

1
2

++ +  =

(+  i)(+  i) +

(+  i)(+  i), (2.40)
then use of the boundary condition (2.24) and the antisymmetric property of the indices of
f ensure the equation (2.38). hence the operator q(l)
b vanishes on the generalized boundary
state (2.25).

another operator q(l)

b is expressed as

q(f )

b =i dh(pm  xm )m

 i .

using the boundary conditions for the superghost [1]

in addition to the boundary conditions (2.23), (2.24), we obtain

+ = i,

q(f )
b |bi = 0.

(2.41)

(2.42)

(2.43)

summing up all together, we see the brst invariance of the generalized boundary state
|bi. since in the generalized boundary state full conguration of the gauge eld coupled to
the boundary is included, this degree of freedom of the gauge eld is found to be actually
one of the collective coordinates of the brst equation. however, any conguration of the
gauge eld is not allowed, since this boundary state contains divergence in general. for special
conguration of the gauge eld, the boundary state is not divergent and well-dened, as in
the case of the bosonic string theory in ref. [14]. we will see this in the next section.

3 correction to the d-brane action

in this section, we calculate the corrections to the d-brane action. the procedure was already
explored in the previous paper [14], and here we shall extend the calculation given there to the
supersymmetric case. we expand the eld strength by derivatives, whose number is at most
two. therefore we are considering the rst correction to the d-brane action, that is o(2),
in the slowly-varying eld approximation.

3.1 divergence in the boundary state

as seen in the denition of the operator in eqs. (2.11) and (2.18), the newly dened boundary
state (2.25) contains short distance divergence on the worldsheet. for the bosonic boundary
state studied in ref. [14], this divergent terms are arranged in a from in which the divergence
is perfectly absorbed into the redenition of the gauge eld. here we show that this is also
the case for the supersymmetric boundary state.

first, write explicitly the zero mode part of the coordinate scalar and fermion as

x () = x + fx (),

8

 = 


0 + e.

(3.1)

the zero mode of the fermion 
arbitrarily on x and we taylor-expand a (x()) around the zero mode x:

0 exists only in the ramond sector. the gauge eld depends

f(x) = f(x) + fx  f(x) +

1

2fx fx  a(x) +    ,
2fx x  f(z) +    .

we decompose the unitary operator concerning the zero modes of x as

u[a] = v u0,

u[f ] = v (f)u (f)
0

where

u0 = exp(cid:18) i
0 = exp(cid:18) 1

(3.10)

in the above equations (3.7) and (3.8) we have kept terms in which the total number of
derivatives acting on f(x) is at most two, for the leading order derivative correction to the
d-brane action, of o(2).

note that [u0, v (f)] = 0 and that the zero mode contribution in the unitary operator is

summarized as

here we have dened the boundary state for the constant eld strength by eqs. (2.4) and
(2.29) as

u0u (f)

|b(f = 0)i =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(cid:16)f (x)(cid:17)e .

place of the constant f in |b(f )i. from these relations we obtain an expression

and the quantity (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(cid:16)f (x)(cid:17)e appearing in eq. (3.9) is obtained by substituting f (x) into the
the base state(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(cid:16)f (x)(cid:17)e is written explicitly only by the creation operators (see eq. (2.29)),

which relate the annihilation operators on(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(cid:16)f (x)(cid:17)e to the creation operators. here o(x) is

an orthogonal matrix dened by

(3.12)

(3.13)

(3.14)

(3.15)

in order to extract the normal ordering divergence in the boundary state (3.11), we change
all the annihilation operators in the derivative perturbation v into the creation ones with use

of these boundary conditions.

we have accomplished this procedure for v and v (f ) upto the order mentioned above, and
present here only the result (see the app. a for the detailed calculation). the result is the

same as the case of the bosonic string theory [14]. the boundary state to this order, expressed
by only the creation operators, contains (0) and (1) divergences. after regularizing one of
the divergences as (0) = 1/2, we are left with an intrinsic short-distance divergence (1).
however, the (1) divergent terms are arranged in a form in which the divergence is perfectly
absorbed into the redenition of the eld strength f (x) as

where the redened eld strength f red(x) is given by

|bi =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(f red(x))e +" creation operators

with nite coecients #(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(cid:16)f (x)(cid:17)e

+

1
4

f

f red
 (x)  f(x) +

1
2

(f + f))  {  }# . (3.16)

this result is precisely in the same form as in the bosonic string case [14]. this redenition
of the gauge eld strength is again related to the redenition of the gauge eld as

ared
 (x)  a(x) +

(1) 

1
2

1

1  f (x)2!

10

f(x).

(3.17)

hence for the well-dened boundary state which is not divergent, we should put the coecient

of (1) in the above redenition to zero. this is a constraint which the gauge eld in the
boundary state should satisfy.

the fact that the divergence (3.16) takes the same form as in the bosonic string theory is

expected from the string  model calculation, since in ref. [24] the divergence in the superstring
 model was shown to be equal to the one in the bosonic string [25] within the one-loop

calculation.

similar to the bosonic string theory [14], the divergence encoded in the eld strength
would be interpreted also from the superstring  model loop calculation. the divergence in

the boundary state might correspond to the one-loop divergence against the propagator on
the boundary of the string worldsheet.

3.2 correction to the d-brane action

although the divergence immanent in the supersymmetric boundary state is found to be

equal to the one in the bosonic string case, the nite part (the second term on the rhs of
eq. (3.15)) has dierent structure. in the boundary state, the part which is relevant for the

d-brane action is concerning the emission of the massless states of the closed string. the
projector which extracts the relevant emission mode is studied recently in ref. [8].
in our

language, the modes in v relevant for the massless emission is only the constant part (since if
one excite  creation operator, the state becomes massive). in addition, the relevant part in
v (f ) is the constant mode and b()

1/2 (only for the ns-ns sector).

1/2b(+)

it is shown in app. a that all of these modes do not appear after changing all the oscillators
in v and v (f ) into creation operators. especially, the constant mode which exists in the bosonic
string case, stemming from v , is canceled exactly by the constant term coming from fermionic
contribution v (f ).

therefore we conclude that there is no o(2) correction to the d-brane action, as for
the part which can be extracted from the boundary state (more precisely, the couplings linear
in the closed string massless modes). this is consistent with expectation from the other works

on the correction to the d-brane action, refs. [11] and [12]. in these literature, it was shown
that there is no o(2) correction in the other sectors (the (curvature)2 sector, and the born-
infeld sector with purely open string gauge elds, respectively). this property of the absence
of the o(2) terms in the d-brane action seems to be general in superstring theory.

4 incorporation of scalar eld and t-duality

in our previous paper [14] and in the former part of this paper, we have studied only the gauge

eld as a boundary degree of freedom. in addition to the gauge eld, there exist scalar elds
as another massless excitation on the d-brane. this scalar eld, usually treated on an equal
footing with the gauge eld, represents the deformation of the d-brane.

in this section, we incorporate this scalar eld into the boundary state. similar to the

gauge eld, the scalar eld takes an arbitrary conguration. the t-duality naturally relates
this scalar eld and the gauge eld on the d-brane, hence we use this perturbative duality so
as to check the consistency.

4.1

incorporation of the scalar eld

for simplicity, we concentrate on the bosonic string theory in sec. 4.1 and 4.2. the general-
ization to the superstring theory is straightforward, and it will be briey mentioned later.

since the scalar eld parameterizes the deformation of the d-brane in the static gauge, let

us dene the boundary state with the scalar eld i(x) as

with a translation operator

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(b)[, a]e  eu []u[a](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(b)(f = 0)e ,
eu[]  exp(cid:18)ii d pii(x)(cid:19) .

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

note that the arguments of the scalar  are x , the tangential coordinates. when  is linear
in x as i(x) = i

x , then we reproduce the result of the tilted d-brane case in ref. [22].

the boundary conditions which the above boundary state satises are as follows. for the
transverse directions, the d-branes are now expected to be deformed to a surface specied by
the scalar, and actually we have

hx i  i(x )i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(b)[, a]e = 0.

on the other hand, the boundary conditions for the tangential directions are also modied as

h(cid:16)p + pii(x)(cid:17) + x f(x)i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(b)[, a]e = 0.

this modication is natural in a sense that the combination p + pii(x) denotes the
translation along the deformed surface of the d-brane. the ghost part is unchanged, as in ref.

[14].

12

both the denition (4.1) and the boundary conditions (4.3) and (4.4) can be understood
through the t-duality. this duality transformation is the exchange of the sign of the right-
moving oscillators : t-duality in the m-th direction is dened as m ()  m (). under
this transformation, x is exchanged for the conjugate momentum as

x m   x m (= p m ).

(4.5)

now, consider the situation with vanishing scalar eld on the dp-brane. taking the t-duality
(4.5) in one of the tangential direction  = p in the boundary condition (2.12), then we obtain
new boundary conditions

pp + x fp(x) = 0,

pe + xefee(x) + x pfep(x) = 0,

(4.6)

(4.7)

on the t-dualized boundary state. the new tangential index e runs from 0 to p  1. using a

relation

fp = ap

(4.8)

and dening new scalar eld as p  ap, then we reproduce eq. (4.4) for d(p1)-brane and
(4.9)

(x p  p) |bi = 0.

this is consistent with the boundary condition in the transverse direction (4.3), and only the
zero mode part is not reproduced.2
if one is not concerned with the zero modes, it is also
possible to understand directly the denition (4.1) as a result of the t-duality. taking the
t-dualities of the operator u[a], then we obtain the denition of the boundary state with the
scalar eld (4.2).

in spite of the introduction of the scalar eld, the boundary state is still brst invariant.
in the case of the bosonic string theory, we need to verify the vanishing of the quantity
pm x m [14] for the brst invariance. with use of the boundary conditions (4.3) and (4.4),
this quantity is evaluated as

px  + pix i = pi(x i  x i(x)) 

1


x x f(x) = 0.

(4.10)

this brst invariance is seen clearly from the t-duality. actually, the operator pm x m
(and the brst charge qb) is t-duality invariant, hence if the previous boundary state with
only the gauge eld is brst invariant, then this is also the case for the one with the scalar
eld.

2the discrepancy on the zero mode part is owing to the fact that we are considering only the oscillator
part of the t-duality transformation, (4.5). if the target space is compactied, winding modes appear and it
becomes possible to treat zero modes simultaneously with oscillating modes. in this paper, uncompactied
at spacetime is assumed.

13

4.2 divergence in the boundary state

using the t-duality nature of the denition of the boundary state (4.1), as for the divergence
in the boundary state, we are trivially led to the same result as in the previous paper [22].

since the translation operator eu [] is transformed into the operator u[a] by the t-duality,

the procedure of changing all the operators into the creation operators is actually almost the

same. all the divergences in the boundary state can be arranged in such a way that they are
absorbed into the redenition of the gauge eld and the scalar eld as

ared
m (x)  am (x) +

1
4

(1)j ln (, f )lfn m (x),

(4.11)

where j(, f )  1 + o(, f ). the indices m, n,   run through all the spacetime directions,
and the gauge elds with transverse index should be understood as scalar elds. the matrix
o(, f ) is dened in the same manner as o n
l , using the following
denition:
0 ! ,

n {(1 + f )1} n

(x)  i(x).

m = (1  f ) l

fm n   f(x)
j

(x)

(4.12)

i
(x)

where i

explicitly for the scalar eld, the redenition becomes

i
red(x)  i(x) +

1
4

(1)j (, f )i(x) +    .

(4.13)

for the boundary state to be well-dened, these divergences should be eliminated, therefore

the background conguration of the gauge eld and the scalar eld should be restricted to the
one which makes the coecient of (1) in eq. (4.11) equal to zero.

the only dierence in calculating the divergence is that in eu [] there exists the zero mode

pi of the operator p i, although in u[a] the corresponding x  has no zero mode. this aects
the zero mode of the transverse part of the boundary state, that has been a delta function

(see eq. (2.6)).

let us see concretely the zero mode part. the relevant modes in the translation operator

eu[] are in the following:

eu [] = exp i(x)


xi 

1

4(cid:20)i d fx fx (cid:21) i(x)



xi +   ! .

here we expand the scalar eld as

i(x) = i(x) + fx i(x) +

1

2fx fx i(x) +    .

14

(4.14)

(4.15)

therefore the zero mode of the generalized boundary state is

(9p)(cid:16)xi  i(x)(cid:17) 

1

4(cid:20)i d fx fx (cid:21) i(x)



xi (9p)(cid:16)xi  i(x)(cid:17) +    ,

(4.16)

where the last omitted part consists of higher order terms.3 the expression of the rst term in
the above representation (4.16) is due to the rst term in the exponent in eq. (4.14). evaluating
the divergence in the second term in eq. (4.16) with use of the boundary condition analogous
to (3.12) now with the constant eld strength (4.12), then we see that the result is

1
4  (1)j   i(x)





xi (9p)(cid:16)xi  i(x)(cid:17)

(4.17)

this divergence can be absorbed into the delta function part in the boundary state, with the

redenition (4.13) as

(9p)(cid:16)xi  i

red(x)(cid:17) .

(4.18)

for general congurations of a and i, the correction to the d-brane action can be
calculated using dimensional reduction (with the identication ap = p), due to the t-
duality. however, as mentioned above, only the zero mode part of the translation operator
eu[] is dierent from t-dualized u[a], thus from this zero mode there appears a new nite

part which contributes to the d-brane action. the relevant term from the second term in eq.
(4.16) is

1
4

j j i(x)



xi (9p)(cid:16)xi  i(x)(cid:17)  (+)

1()
1.

(4.19)

when contracting with the closed string massless modes, this contribution gives a new term

in the correction to the bosonic d-brane action, in addition to the contributions from the
dimensional reduction of the gauge eld from ten-dimension.

4.3 supersymmetric case and correction to the d-brane action

as for the supersymmetric boundary state studied in sec. 2, the scalar elds can be associated
in the same manner. adopt the same redenition ()  () and i(x)  ai(x), and
then for the fermionic coordinates, dene the t-duality transformation as

3 although the second term in eq. (4.16) proportional to  corresponds to the f mode in u [a] by t-
duality, this term contains already the derivative acting on the delta function, thus the number of the derivatives
on the eld strength () are already two. therefore, the term in proportion to () or ()() are
higher order terms.

  .

(4.20)

15

all of the calculation of the divergence in the boundary state can be read in correspondence

with sec. 3 through the t-duality, except for the zero modes of the operator eu [] considered

in the previous subsection. (note that fermionic zero mode in the r-r sector does not make

mischief.) as for the divergence, this zero mode contribution precisely gives the redenition of
the scalar eld in the delta function, which results in no correction. although in the bosonic
string theory this zero mode contribution yields the correction to the d-brane action (4.19), in

superstring case this correction does not appear since the corresponding excitation is massive.

as seen in sec. 3.2, there is no o(2) correction to the d-brane action in the superstring
theory in the case of non-trivial gauge eld conguration. hence in the superstring case, even
if one incorporates the general brane deformation specied by (x), the d-brane action is
not corrected upto this order.

4.4 boundary state for brane ending on brane

well-dened congurations of the introduced gauge eld and scalar eld are the ones in which
the divergent part of the redenition (3.16) (and (4.13)) vanishes. therefore for studying the
well-dened boundary state, one must substitute to a and i the solutions of this constraint
which is identical with the leading-order equations of motion derived from the open superstring
 model approach.

one of the interesting solution is the bion conguration (or called spike soliton) [17, 18].
this conguration is known to be a solution of the equations of motion corrected to all order

in the derivative expansion [19]. therefore, if one assumes that the divergence in the boundary
state exactly coincides with the divergence in the string  model to all order, then this bion
conguration is the most natural among nontrivial congurations of a and i, for a well-
dened boundary state. another interesting respect concerning this solution is that this bion
conguration represents f-strings (or d-strings) ending on a d-brane [17, 20]. hence adopting

the bion solution we obtain boundary states representing branes ending on another d-brane.

let us consider a specic example of a d-string stuck to a d3-brane. the corresponding
bion solution is the bps conguration for a point magnetic charge in the worldvolume theory

on the d3-brane:

ba = a9(x)

with

9 = 1/r,

r q(x 1)2 + (x 2)2 + (x 3)2,

(4.21)

where ba is the magnetic eld with a = 1, 2, 3. let us evaluate this singular operator 1/r by
 expansion. put the center of mass of the string attached to this boundary state at x1 = 

16

and x2 = x3 = 0. then expand the magnetic eld around the center of mass as

b1 = 

1
2 + oscil., b2 = 0 + oscil., b3 = 0 + oscil.

(4.22)

we evaluate the eect of the constant mode of the magnetic eld. the contribution of the

center of mass becomes

fm n =

0
0
0

1/2

0

0
0 1/2
1/2

1/2

0
0
0

,



(4.23)

where the each column and row denote the direction along x1, x2, x3, x9, respectively. calcu-
lating the matrix o from this f and taking the limit   0 (in this limit we are approaching
to the d-string region, along the conjecture in ref. [17]), then we have

o  diag(1,1,1,1).

(4.24)

this means that the original neumann directions x1, x2, x3 change their signs in front of the
bilinear combination of the oscillators in the exponent of the boundary state (see eq. (2.5))

and become dirichlet directions, while the 9-th (originally dirichlet) direction also changes
the sign so as to become a neumann type. this result does not depend on where we expand
the magnetic eld, so long as we take the limit of approaching to the singular point xa  0.
therefore we have examined that the singular center of the bion corresponds to a d-string

which extends to the 9-th direction.

5 conclusion

in this paper we have constructed generalized supersymmetric boundary state which incorpo-

rates arbitrary congurations of massless elds on the d-brane. in order to introduce such
arbitrariness we follow ref. [14], where the bosonic boundary state was generalized by a gauge
transformation of a string eld theory which is an analogue of a string  model gauge trans-

formation of closed string theory.

the newly dened boundary state is brst invariant, and obeys the non-linear bound-

ary conditions (2.23) and (2.24) which are in the same form as derived in a superstring 
model [24]. though this brst invariance is veried for arbitrary conguration of the back-
ground gauge eld, the boundary state contains short distance divergences originating in the

products of coordinate elds on the worldsheet. for obtaining well-dened boundary state,

17

the divergent entry should be eliminated, and this constraint has been found to be identical

with the conformal invariance ((a) = 0) in a superstring  model loop calculation. this
has been checked at least within the next-to-leading order (o(2) correction, correspond-
ing to the one-loop calculation in the  model). after this subtraction, we have extracted
nite corrections to the d-brane action at this order, and have found that there exists no
correction of o(2) to the coupling linear in the closed string massless modes. for the r-r
sector this property of no-correction is expected from the fact that the coupling is relevant for
the anomaly cancellation. on the other hand, for the ns-ns sector the result is non-trivial.
the absence of the o(2) correction to the d-brane action seems to be universal (see refs.
[12, 11, 26]).

the t-duality transformation relates dirichlet and neumann directions, hence it inter-

changes the gauge eld with the scalar eld on the d-brane. this t-duality has enabled us to
incorporate also the general conguration of the scalar eld into the boundary state. taking

a bps conguration which was previously studied as bion [17, 18, 20], the divergence in the
boundary state vanishes and one obtains a boundary state for branes ending on another brane.

especially adopting a bion solution which represents a d-string stuck to a d3-brane, we have
evaluated the boundary state near the spike, and showed that in this region the form of the
boundary state approaches actually to the one of a d-string.

since we have constructed boundary states which incorporates arbitrary congurations of
boundary coupled background massless elds, various brane congurations are to be realized in

the worldsheet conformal eld theories, using some specic congurations of the background.
for example, string junctions [27] have been already realized in two-dimensional gauge theory

on d-strings [28], therefore it is possible to discuss the junctions with a single boundary state.
or, using other bion congurations, one can study fundamental strings stuck to a d-brane.
in this case, boundary states representing fundamental strings4 appear, and it is interesting
to study how this boundary states express the mechanism of the joining-splitting process of
the fundamental strings.

on the other hand, most of intriguing brane congurations are related to non-abelian
congurations of yang-mills-higgs theory. one of the examples belonging to this category is
string junctions terminated on d3-branes (1/4 bps dyons in super yang-mills theory [29]).

a non-abelian version of the generalized boundary state would be obtained with use of a
path-ordered unitary operator u[a]. evaluation of this kind of operator seems to be dicult

technically. these remain to be studied in the future works.

appendix

a calculation of the divergence in the boundary state

in this appendix, we present the evaluation of the generalized boundary state. as mentioned
in sec. 3, for extracting the couplings between closed string excitations and boundary degrees

of freedom, the boundary state should be in a form where all the oscillators are written only
by creation operators. for simplicity, we do not consider the scalar eld in this appendix.

we calculate the divergences in the boundary state by changing all the oscillators in v and
v (f) (eqs. (3.7) and (3.8)) into creation operators explicitly, by using the boundary conditions

(3.12) and (3.13) which hold on the boundary state (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(cid:16)f (x)(cid:17)e. we keep only terms up

to o(2) (at most two derivatives on the eld strength f ), therefore the quantity to be
evaluated is

1 + (v  1) + (v (f)  1) + vmix,

(a.1)

where the last term vmix contains contributions from both the bosonic part and the fermionic
part,

vmix (cid:20)i
we shall evaluate these three terms (v  1), (v (f)  1), and vmix respectively in the following.

1. for the bosonic part v  1, we already have the result in ref. [22], since the boundary
condition for the bosonic oscillators in the supersymmetric boundary state is the same
as in the bosonic boundary state. the result is as follows: first, the (1) divergences

in v can be completely absorbed into the redenition of the gauge eld (or the gauge

the second term in the above equation does not contribute to the d-brane eective
action5, since these excitations are related to the coupling between the boundary and
the massive excitations of the closed string: ()2 + ()4 + ()6. hence the relevant
correction is the rst term in eq. (a.3).

 oscillators

2. the last term vmix in (a.1) does not contribute both to the divergence in the boundary
state and to the d-brane eective action. a possible contraction which may bring out
the divergence is

i d fx fx fx i d(+  i)b(+  i)cfx a .

(a.5)

(this is because if one contract two of the three xs in the rst integral, the rest single
x has no zero mode and therefore the whole quantity vanishes. this is also the case
for the fermion contraction.) evaluating the contraction (a.5), one can easily see that
there is no divergence (1). additionally, there is no contribution to the d-brane, since
the massless excitation part of the boundary state does not stem from this vmix, even
after the contraction in the way (a.5).

3. finally, for the fermionic part (v (f)  1), we evaluate three non-trivial terms in eq. (3.8).
(a) first, the term proportional to f (the rst line in eq. (3.8)) has no divergence
and it is safely changed to the form written only by the creation operators. this

is because the contraction between two s makes no sence due to the fact that fx

has no zero mode.

(b) secondly, let us see that the term proportional to f (the second line in eq.

(3.8)) contains divergence. changing all the  oscillators in two fxs into creation

operators, then we have

5 in the boundary state, the terms which contribute to the d-brane action is of the form

this equality holds only on the boundary state (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(cid:16)f (x)(cid:17)e. the rest fermionic

contraction is

i d()()fx fx ,

(a.7)

however this does not give any divergence. therefore, one sees the single divergent
term in eq. (a.6) from the f part in (v (f)  1). referring to the denition of the
exponent r of the boundary state, eq. (2.18), this (1) divergence in (a.6) can be

absorbed into the redenition of the gauge eld strength in the boundary state as

f red
 (x)  f(x) +

f.

(a.8)

this is a part of the total redenition of the gauge eld (3.16). the nite part
after the redenition of the gauge eld strength consists of the ()2 term in eq.
(a.6) and (a.7). both of these terms contain two s, hence do not couple to the
massless modes of the closed superstring. therefore, the f part does not give
any correction to the d-brane action.

(c) the evaluation of the nal term in (v (f)  1),

i d(e+  ie)(e+  ie)fx  i d(e+  ie)b(e+  ie)cfx a,

is found to be rather complicated, as in the case of the bosonic string [22]. for

(a.9)

simplicity, we consider only e which is non-zero modes of the fermionic operator

. (the zero modes of  exists only in the r-r sector, and they will be treated
separately later.) we change all the oscillators in this (a.9) into creation opera-
tors, using the boundary conditions (3.12) and (3.13). after some straight forward
calculation, the result is found as

(a.9) = c + (b)2 + (other terms)

(a.10)

on the boundary state (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(cid:16)f (x)(cid:17)e. here the rst constant c term and the second

term quadratic in b contain (1) divergence as seen in the following, and the rest
other terms consisting of (b)2()2, (b)4 and (b)4()2 have nite coecients.
furthermore, these other terms couple to the massive excitations of the closed

superstring and thus have no contribution to the d-brane action. the rst constant
term c is given as follows:

the dierence between the ns-ns sector and the r-r sector stems from the fact
that the lattice point to be summed in the region consists of integer lattice (the
ns-ns sector) or half-odd integer lattice (the r-r sector) along the direction of

axis q. for the ns-ns sector, there is no lattice point on the line q + m = 0 in
g. 1, while for the r-r sector, lattice points on this line will give the zero mode

contribution which will be dealt with later. one can see from eq. (a.12) that the
(1) divergence exists only in the r-r sector, and nite terms (after regularizing as
(0) = 1/2) for the r-r sector and the ns-ns sector are the same. substituting
the summation (a.12) into (a.11), the (1) divergent term in c in eq. (a.10) is

found as

and ns-ns sector is

(a.14)

referring to eq. (2.31), only in the r-r sector there is a front factor in the boundary
state for the fermionic sector (in the case of constant eld strength). thus the

the front normalization factor of the boundary state through redenition of the
gauge eld strength as

divergence (a.13) in front of the boundary state (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(cid:16)f (x)(cid:17)e can be absorbed into
(1)hnj fj (f + f)o  {  }i . (a.15)

this is the last term in the redenition (3.16). on the other hand, the nite
contribution (a.14) results in a nal form

ff hj j (j  + j )i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(cid:16)f (x)(cid:17)e .

this is common for both the ns-ns and r-r sector. furthermore, one observes
that this nite constant factor exactly cancels the nite constant factor stemming
from the bosonic part (a.3).

secondly, we check that the divergence in the (b)2 term in eq. (a.10) can be
absorbed also by the redenition (a.15). the explicit expression of the (b)2 term
in eq. (a.10) is

(a.16)

(a.17)

in obtaining this expression, we have used the antisymmetric property of the indices
(b  c) and (  ), and change of the region for summation: (i)(i+3) with
(m, q)  (m,q) simultaneously. let us extract the (1) divergence in this
expression (a.17). for example, in the last term in (a.17), there is a (1) divergence

in the summation 1/m in the region (6), as seen if we x the excitation number

23

m  q of the oscillator b. in this manner, we obtain the divergence in (b)2 in eq.
(a.10) as

(a.18)

it is easy to show that this divergence can be absorbed into the exponent of the

boundary state (2.29) by the redenition (a.15).

the nite contribution to the d-brane action from (a.17) should be of the form
b()
1/2 b(+)
1/2 in the ns-ns sector. extracting that part, the coecient of the term is
turned out to be zero. thus there is no contribution to the d-brane action from
this (b)2 term.

finally, we consider the zero mode contribution in the term (a.9) in the r-r sector.
written explicitly the coecients, the zero mode contribution is

1

2(cid:18) 1
8(cid:19)2

4 

fafbci d (e+  ie)fx  i d b(e+  ie)cfx a. (a.19)

the front factor 4 is due to the antisymmetric nature of the indices of f . changing
all the oscillators in (a.19) with use of the boundary conditions (3.12) and (3.13),

we obtain
1
32

(1)fafbcb (j cj a  j cj a) + ()2 + (b)2 + ()2(b)2.

(a.20)

the last three terms do not contain any divergence, and have no contribution to
the d-brane action. the rst divergent term can be absorbed by the redenition of
the eld strength (a.15), into the fermionic zero mode part of the boundary state

(2.30).

summing up all contributions, we conclude that all the divergences in the boundary state

can be absorbed into the redenition of the gauge eld strength (3.16), and the rest nite
contributions relevant for the d-brane action vanishes.
