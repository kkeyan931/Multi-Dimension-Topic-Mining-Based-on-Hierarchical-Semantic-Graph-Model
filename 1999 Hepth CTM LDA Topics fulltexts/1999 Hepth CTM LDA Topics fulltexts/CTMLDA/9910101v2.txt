introduction

the existence of the renormalization group (rg) in the quantum eld theory was dis-
covered by e.c.g.stueckelberg and a.peterman [1]. rg techniques were successfully
developed by gellmann and low [2] in their investigation of the eective charge behav-
ior. they rst noticed that the derivative d log (p)/dt is only a function of the eective
ne structure constant:

(p) =

e2(p)
4

where e(p) is the eective charge, p is a 4momentum and

t = log

p2
m 2

(1)

(2)

with m as a momentum cuto.

in gauge theories without monopoles the gellmannlow rg equation has the follow-

ing form:

d log (p)

dt

= ((p))

where the function () depends on the lagrangian describing the theory.

at suciently small charge ( < 1) the function is given by a series over /4:

() = 2(


4

) + 4(

2

)


4

+ ...

(3)

(4)

the rst two terms of this series were calculated in qed a long time ago [3,4]. the
following result was obtained in the framework of the perturbation theory (in the one
and twoloop approximations):

a)

and

b)

2 =

4
3

,

2 =

1
3

,

4 = 4

 for fermion (electron) loops

4 = 1

 for scalar particle loops.

(5)

(6)

this result means that for both cases a) and b) the function can be represented by the
following series:

() = 2(

)(1 + 3

+ ...)

(7)

and we are able to use the oneloop approximation up to   1 (with accuracy  25%
for   1).
in the present paper we consider the abelian quantum eld theory when both electri-
cally and magnetically charged particles with charges e and g, respectively, present in the
theory which we call below qemd (quantum electromagnetodynamics) following the
terminology used in ref.[5]. in their review [5], m.blagojevic and p.senjanovic described
the various formulations [6-15] of the abelian quantum eld theories containing two cou-
pling constants (electric and magnetic charges) connected via the quantization condition.
several topics were treated there: diracs and schwingers quantum mechanics of the
monopole, connection with non-abelian monopoles, a supersymmetric generalization of
the theory and other aspects.

the aim of this paper is to investigate in qemd the corresponding rg equations
for electric () and magnetic ( ) ne structure constants in accordance with the dirac
relation for the minimal charges:

below we consider qemd in the zwanziger formalism [9].

2 the zwanziger formalism for the abelian gauge theory with

electric and magnetic charges

a version of the local eld theory for the abelian gauge elds interacting with electrically
and magnetically charged particles is represented by the zwanziger formalism [9,10] (see
also [16]) which considers two potentials a(x) and b(x) describing one physical photon
with two physical degrees of freedom.

in this theory the total eld system of the gauge, electrically- () and magnetically-
charged () elds is described by the partition function which has the following form in
euclidean space:

z = z [da][db][d][d ][d][d ]es

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

where

the zwanziger action szw(a, b) is given by:

s = szw(a, b) + sgf + se + sm.

szw(a, b) = z d4x[
i
2

(n  [  a])(n  [  b]) 
where we have used the following designations:

+

2

(n  [  a])2 +

(n  [  b])2 +

i

(n  [  b])(n  [  a])]

[a  b] = ab  ab,

g

 =

(n  [a  b]) = n(a  b),
1
2

g,

with n representing the direction of the frozen dirac string.

sgf in eq.(12) is the gaugexing action and the actions se and sm:

se,m = z d4xle,m(x)

describe the matter elds with the electric and magnetic charges, respectively.

here we have a number of possibilities. the electrically- and magnetically-charged
elds can be described by the following lagrangian expressions (given in minkowski
space):

a)

if they are fermions (electrons or monopoles, respectively). in eqs.(16), (17)

le = (id  e),
lm = (i d  m)

and

are the covariant derivatives.

if the electrically- and magnetically-charged particles are the kleingordon complex
scalars. but for the higgs scalars with electric and magnetic charges we have the fol-
lowing lagrangians:

the complex scalar elds:

and

contain higgs (, ) and goldstone (1, 2) boson elds.

sgf = z d4x[

3 dual symmetry and charge quantization conditions

in the last years gauge theories essentially operate with the fundamental idea of duality
(see, for example, reviews [8] and references there).

duality is a symmetry appearing in free electromagnetism as invariance of the free

maxwell equations:

(28)

(29)

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

(34)

  ~b = 0,
  ~e = 0,

  ~e = 0 ~b,
  ~b = 0~e,

under the interchange of electric and magnetic elds:

~e  ~b,

~b  ~e.

letting

it is easy to see that the following equations:

f =   a = (  b),
f  =   b = (  a),

which together with the bianchi identity:

f = 0,

f 

 = 0

are equivalent to eqs.(28), show invariance under the hodge star operation on the eld
tensor:

f 

 =

1
2

f

(35)

(here f  = f ).
invariance under the following duality transformations:

this hodge star duality applied to the free zwanziger lagrangian (13) leads to its

(  a)  (  b),
introducing the interacting maxwell equations:

f  f ,

(  a)  (  b).

f = je
,

f 

 = jm
 ,

with the local conservation laws for the electric and magnetic charges:

je,m

 = 0,

(36)

(37)

(38)

(39)

we immediately see the invariance of these equations under the exchange of the electric
and magnetic elds (hodge star duality) provided that at the same time electric and
magnetic charges and currents (and masses if they are dierent) are also interchanged:

together with e  m in eqs.(16), (17), (20), (21), (24), (25), and e  m in eqs.(24),
(25).

e  g,

(40)

the corresponding quantum eld theory with electric ei and magnetic gi charges is

selfconsistent if both charges are quantized according to the famous dirac relation [6]:

eigj = 2nij

(41)

when nij is an integer. for nij = 1 we have the dirac quantization condition (8) in terms
of the elementary electric and magnetic charges. but j.schwinger [8] showed another
possibility for the charge quantization condition when instead of eq.(8) we have:

eg = 4.

(42)

the results (8) and (42) depend on the choice of the string singularity line. we prefer to
consider the dirac semi-innite string and the dirac relation (8) as a charge quantization
condition.

if the fundamental electric charge e is so small that it corresponds to the perturbative
electric theory, then magnetic charges are large and correspond to the strongly interacting
magnetic theory, and vice versa. but below we consider some small region of e, g values
(we hope that it exists) which allows us to employ the perturbation theory in both, electric
and magnetic, sectors.

when non-trivial dyons  particles with both electric and magnetic charges simal-
taneously  are present, then the analogue of the dirac relation becomes a little more
complicated and it then reads:

eigj  ejgi = 2nij

(43)

which is duality invariant (see for example the reviews [5], [17] and the references there).
the relation (43) has the name of the diracschwingerzwanziger [6,8,9] quantization

condition. but in this paper the theory of dyons is not exploited.

4 propagators

at the same time as the partition function (11) let us consider the generating functional
with external sources j (a)

 , j (b)

 ,  and :

z[j (a), j (b), , ] =

= z [da][db][d][d ][d][d ]es+(j (a),a)+(j (b),b)+(,)+( ,)+(,)+( ,)

(44)

where

(j, a) = z d4xj(x)a(x),

and (, ) = z d4x(x)(x),

etc.

(45)

using this generating functional it is not dicult to calculate the propagators of the elds
considered in our model.

three bare propagators of the gauge elds a and b:

q0(a)

 =< aa >=

q0(b)

 =< bb >=

 j (b)



(46)

are presented in fig.1 (see fig.1(a)) together with the propagators q(a)
determined by fig.1(b).

 , q(b)

 and q(ab)



propagators (46) were calculated by authors of ref.[16] in the momentum space:

q0(a,b)



(q) =

(47)

(48)

(49)

the dot on the diagrams of fig.1(a,b) corresponds to the following operator:

considering qed with lagrangian (16) for electrons (monopoles are absent in this case)
it is easy to see that the bare d0
(q2) and the dressed (renormalized) dren,(q2)
photon propagators obey the following relation presented in fig.2:

dren,(q) = d0

(q) + d0

(q)(q)dren,(q).

(50)

here the contribution of the electron loop is described by the operator (q) given by
the following expression:

(q) = e2 z

d4k
(2)4 t r[g(k)(k, k  q)g(k  q)]

(51)

where  is the dirac matrix,  is the renormalized vertex and g(k) is the dressed
propagator of the electron. taking into account the transversality of the photon self-
energy tensor we have:

(52)
the dressed propagators q(a)
ren, containing the contributions of
the electric (thin lines) and magnetic (thick lines) charged particle loops are presented in
fig.3.

(q) = (q2  qq)(q2).
ren,, q(b)

the lagrangians (16) and (17) contain the interaction terms je

a and jm

 b where je


and jm

 are the electric and magnetic currents:

and

je

 = g .
jm

the interactions in the lagrangians (20)-(23) are given by je
seagull terms e2aa+ and g2bb+, respectively, but now we have:

a and jm

je
 = e(+  +)
jm
 = g(+  +).

and

(56)
the simplest electron-electron, monopole-monopole and electron-monopole interac-
tions corresponding to the lagrangians le,m given by eqs.(16) and (17) are shown in
fig.4.

now we are ready to obtain the renormalization group equations for the eective ne
structure constants when both, electric and magnetic charges are present in our eld
system.

5 renormalization group equations for the electric and mag-

netic fine structure constants

the gellmannlow rg equation (3) can be obtained by the calculation of the dressed
propagators. in the case of qed the relation shown in fig.2 gives us:

where the renormalization constant z3 is related, in its turn, with (q2) determined by
eqs.(51),(52):

d(q) = z 1

3 d0(q)

(57)

here  is the energy scale: q2 = 2.

z3 = 1  (2).

the gellmannlow -function is given by the following expression:

or

((p)) = 

 log z3
 log 2 ,

((p)) = 

 log (1  (2))

 log 2

.

(58)

(59)

(60)

in the oneloop approximation of perturbation theory (see for example [18]) we can write:

((p)) 

(2)
 log 2  

(m 2)
 log m 2

(61)

where m is the momentum cuto.

let us consider now the renormalization group equations for  and  when both

(electric and magnetic) charges are present in our theory.

fig.3 shows the contributions of the electric (thin lines) and magnetic (thick lines)
charged-particle loops to the dressed propagators q(a)
ren,. we consider also
the dressed propagators in loops assuming the theory of the case a) with lagrangians
le,m given by eqs.(16) and (17).

ren, = (z3 z3)

q(ab)

(64)
it is not dicult to calculate z3 and z3 according to the diagrams shown in fig.3. these
diagrams demonstrate the following relations:

(67)

using the expressions (47) and (48) obtained in ref.[16] for propagators q0(a,b,ab)

and
the limit ma,b   in eq.(47), it is possible to show that the following relations are
valid:
(68)

1/2 ,

1/2 .

here (e)(2) and (m)(2) are given at q2 = 2 by the photon selfenergy tensors (e)

and (m)
 corresponding to the electron and monopole loops, respectively (see bubbles in
fig.3):

(e,m)



(q) = (q2  qq)(e,m)(q2)

(72)

where (e) (or (m)) is described by eqs.(51),(52) with e, e (or g, m) as a charge and a
mass of the electron (or monopole).

j.schwinger was the rst (see refs.[8]) who investigated the renormalization problem

of the electric and magnetic charges in qemd.

considering the bare charges e0 and g0 and the renormalized eective charges e and

g, we must distinguish between two opposite cases. it was shown in refs.[8,11,12]:

while other authors [13,14] obtained the following result:

e/g = e0/g0,

eg = e0g0.

(73)

(74)

s.coleman [15] analysed the case when the extended thooftpolyakov monopole is shrunk
to zero size. the eective theory describing the interaction between such objects in qemd
tells us something about the renormalization eects. the consistency condition gave the
following result:

or

eg = (z3 z3)

1/2

e0g0 = 2,

z3 z3 = 1.

(75)

(76)

this means that the dirac relation (8) is valid not only for the bare charges e0 and g0,
but also for the renormalized eective charges e and g.

we have actually already rederived this result in the zwanziger formalism, since we
can obtain it by using (70) and (71). let us in fact multiply (70) on both sides with

1/z3  (m)(2)/q z3 and (71) by 1/q z3  (m)(2)/z3 and then add the resulting

equations. the last ones become by the cancellation of  terms giving

from which it is easily seen that eq.(76) follows.

qz3 + q z3 = 1/qz3 + 1/q z3,

(77)

8

using this result we obtain the following important relations:

z3 = z 1

3 =

1  (e)(2)
1  (m)(2)

.

(78)

rg equations for the ne structure constants  and  immediately follow from eq.(78):

 log 2 = (m)( )  (e)().

here the analytical expressions for functions are given by the same eq.(60):

(e,m)( or ) = 

 log (1  (e,m)(2))

 log 2

,

(79)

(80)

(81)

(82)

but now these functions contain electron (e, e) and monopole (g, m) parameters,
respectively.

the obtained rg equations (80) and (81) obey the following equality:

d(log (p))

dt

= 

d(log (p))

dt

which corresponds to the dirac relation:

(t) (t) =

1
4

(for all t)

(83)

(84)

valid for the renormalized electric and magnetic ne structure constants at the arbitrary
scales.

6 the betafunctions

the functions (e,m) are given perturbatively by the expressions similar to eq.(4):

(e)() = (e)

)

(85)

(86)

the perturbative expansions (85) and (86) coincide with the series (4) calculated in qed,
at least on the level of the twoloop approximation. the monopole(electric) loops inside
the electric(monopole) loops appear only on the level of the threeloop approximation.
of course, these functions are dierent if we consider magnetic scalar particles instead
of electric fermions, or vice versa. the corresponding coecients (e)
of the series

(85) or (m)
the charged particles.

, (m)

of the series (86) are given by eqs.(5) or (6) depending on the type of

2

4

if both matter elds are electrically- and magnetically-charged fermions or both are
scalars then we have the same expressions for the functions (e,m) and we can write the
following equations for the cases a) and b):

d(log (p))

dt

= 

d(log (p))

dt

= 2

(1 + 3

 + 

4

+ ...).

(87)

the last equations show that the oneloop approximation works with accuracy < 30% if

both  and  obey the following requirement:

0.25 < ,  < 1.

(88)

but strictly speaking, we dont know the exact behaviour of the whole asymptotic series
(87).

in refs.[19] and [20] the behaviour of the eective ne structure constants was in-
vestigated in the vicinity of the phase transition point in compact (lattice) qed by the
montecarlo simulation method. the following result was obtained [19,20]:

lat
crit  0.20

and

lat
crit  1.25.

(89)

these values almost coincide with the borders of the perturbation theory requirement (88).
in consequence, assuming that the phase transition couplings (89) may be described by
the oneloop approximation with accuracy not worse than (30  50)%, we have tried to
calculate them in the higgsed monopole model (see ref.[21]). the aim of the last paper
was to conrm, in general, the idea of the approximate universality (regularization
independence) of the phase transition couplings. the result obtained in [21]:

lat
crit  0.185

and

lat
crit  1.35

(90)

is in accordance with the lattice result (89). it seems that the idea of the approximate
universality for the rst-order phase transitions is really conrmed.

7 conclusions

the aim of this paper was to obtain the renormalization group equations for the electric
and magnetic renormalized ne structure constants using the zwanziger formalism for
qemd. the result (see eqs.(80) and (81)):

d(log (p))

dt

d(log (p))

dt

= 

= (e)()  (m)( )

(91)

conrms the dirac relation (t) (t) = 1/4 existing at the arbitrary scale.

according to the philosophy given in the introduction it is possible to consider the
perturbation theory for (e)() and (m)( ) simultaneously if both  and  are suciently
small. then the functions (e,m) are given perturbatively by the usual series (4) or (7).
the calculations in qed (see section 1) have shown that the perturbation theory works
up to  < 1. due to the dirac relation (9), such a requirement leads to the following

10

condition:  > 0.25. in consequence, we have qemd rg equations with beta-functions
(e,m) considered perturbatively if both  and  obey the following requirement:

0.25 < ,  < 1.

(92)

we have just this case in the vicinity of the phase transition point for the compact (lattice)
qed: lat

crit  0.2 and lat

crit  1.25 (see refs.[19] and [20]).
