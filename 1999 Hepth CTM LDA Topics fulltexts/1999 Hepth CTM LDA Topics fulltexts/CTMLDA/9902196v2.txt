abstract

using boundary states we derive the presence of (chiral) fermions on the
intersection of type 0 d-branes. the corresponding anomalous couplings on
the branes are then computed. furthermore, we discuss systems of branes
at c2/ n orbifold singularities. in particular, the massless spectrum on the
branes is derived, and a boundary state description is given.

1 introduction

type 0 string theories [1] have recently attracted a lot of attention. the hope is
that information on non-supersymmetric gauge theories can be extracted by embed-
ding them in these non-supersymmetric string theories [2, 3]. as in the ads/cft
correspondence for type ii string theory [4], d-branes play a crucial role in this
conjectured string theory/gauge theory correspondence. in this paper, we will be
concerned with the relation between type 0 d-branes and the supersymmetric type
ii d-branes. we will show how certain results, well established in the type ii con-
text, can be extended to the type 0 one.

in the neveu-schwarz-ramond formulation, type ii string theories are obtained
by imposing independent gso projections on the left and right moving part. this
amounts to keeping the following (left,right) sectors:

where for instance r is the ramond sector projected with pgso = (1  ()f )/2,
f being the world-sheet fermion number.
there is another, equivalent choice for both theories (related to the rst choice

by a spacetime reection):

iib :
iia :

(ns+, ns+) ,
(ns+, ns+) ,

(r, r) ,
(r, r+) ,

(r, ns+) ,
(r, ns+) ,

(ns+, r) ;
(ns+, r+) .

for the massless r-r sector the dierence between the primed and unprimed the-
ories shows up in opposite chiralities of the bi-spinor containing the r-r eld
strengths. this implies a sign dierence in the poincare duality relations among
these eld strengths, resulting in a selfdual ve-form eld strength in iib and an
antiselfdual one in iib, for instance.

the type 0 string theories contain instead the following sectors:

0b :
0a :

(ns+, ns+) ,
(ns+, ns+) ,

(ns, ns) ,
(ns, ns) ,

(r+, r+) ,
(r+, r) ,

(r, r) ;
(r, r+) .

these theories do not contain bulk spacetime fermions, which would have to come
from mixed (r,ns) sectors.1 the inclusion of the ns-ns sectors with odd fermion
numbers means that the closed string tachyon is not projected out. the third
dierence with type ii theories is that the r-r spectrum is doubled: the r-r
potentials of the primed and unprimed type ii theories are combined, resulting for
instance in an unconstrained ve-form eld strength in type 0b.

because of the doubling of the r-r spectrum, there are in type 0b two kinds
of d3-branes, named electric and magnetic in constrast to the selfdual d3-brane
of type iib. the recent literature has developed in two main directions. first, the
gauge theory on a superposition of a large number of electric branes was studied,
leading to non-supersymmetric, non-conformal, tachyon-free gauge theories [2, 6, 7].
second, equal numbers of electric and magnetic d3-branes were superposed, giving
a non-supersymmetric large n conformal eld theory [3, 8, 9].

in this paper we will be mostly interested in the second situation. a superpo-
sition of equally many electric and magnetic branes is reminiscent of the type ii
branes (see section 2), which have been well studied. it will turn out that a lot of
results can be transferred to type 0 almost without eort. for instance (section 3),
chiral fermions are present on certain intersections of electric and magnetic branes,
leading to anomaly inow on the intersection via anomalous d-brane couplings.
these, in turn, lead to the creation of a string when certain d-branes cross each
other.

in ref.

[10], the conguration of many type iib d3-branes sitting at a c2/ n
orbifold singularity was considered, and the spectrum of the corresponding super-
symmetric world-volume theory was described. in section 4, we consider the analo-
gous type 0 situation. we will derive the non-supersymmetric massless spectrum of
1however, fermions will occur when d-branes are introduced [5]. this will be crucial for our

results.

equally many electric and magnetic type 0 branes at a c2/ n orbifold singularity.
the theory can be seen as an orbifold of the large n conformal eld theory [3]
of equally many electric and magnetic d3-branes in at space. according to an
argument of ref. [9], it is still conformal in the large n limit. we have checked this
by computing that the gauge coupling beta function vanishes, in that limit, up to
two-loop order.

in many respects type 0 string theory is the result of a clever way of breaking
supersymmetry.
in taking the orbifold from type ii to type 0 the resulting the-
ory, although non-supersymmetric, still exhibits features reminiscent of the parent
theory. from the strong resemblances between type ii and type 0 string theories,
one may hope to draw more conclusions about non-supersymmetric theories by
reinterpreting old results from supersymmetric string theory in this new context.

2 d-branes in type 0 string theory

d-branes in type 0 theories have been discussed in refs [5] and [6]. in this section
we mainly review some of their results.

as discussed in the introduction, the spectrum of type 0 theories contains two
(p + 1)-form r-r potentials for each even (0a) or odd (0b) p. we will denote these
by cp+1 and c 
p+1, referring to the unprimed and primed type ii theories mentioned
above. for our purposes, more convenient combinations are

(cp+1) =

1
2

(cp+1  c 

p+1) .

(2.1)

for p = 3 these are the electric (+) and magnetic () potentials [6]. we will adopt
this terminology also for other values of p.
there are four types of elementary d-branes for each p: an electric and a
magnetic one (i.e., charged under (cp+1)), and the corresponding antibranes. in
ref. [6] the interaction energy of two identical parallel (p + 1)-branes was derived
by computing the relevant cylinder diagram in the open string channel, analogously
to the polchinski computation [11] in type ii. isolating, via modular transforma-
tion, the contributions due to the exchange of long-range elds in the closed string
channel, it is found on the one hand that the tension of these branes is a factor
2 smaller than for type ii branes. on the other hand, the r-r repulsive force
between two like branes has the double strength of the graviton-dilaton attraction
[6]; thus the type 0 branes couple to the corresponding r-r potentials (cp+1) with
the same charge as the branes in type ii couple to the potential cp+1.

the cylinder diagram between two d-branes in type ii can also be considered
as a tree-level diagram in which a closed string propagates between two boundary
states. a boundary state is a particular brst invariant closed string state that
describes the emission of a closed string from a d-brane. it satises conditions2 that

2we refer to ref.

[12] for explicit expressions, conventions and normalizations for boundary

3

correspond to the boundary conditions for open strings ending on the d-brane. in
particular, for the fermionic elds  the boundary state |b, ins,r, which depends
on the sector, r or ns, and on an additional sign  = , satises

(  is



)|b, ins,r = 0 ,

(2.2)

where s
 is diagonal, with entries 1 in the worldvolume and 1 in the transverse
directions. in type ii theories, the gso projection requires a mixture of the two
choices  = 1. indeed, starting, e.g., with  = +1, one nds that the type ii
boundary state |bi = pgso|b, +ins pgso|b, +ir is

|bi =

1
2

((|b, +ins  |b,ins)  (|b, +ir + |b,ir)) .

(2.3)

we remark that in the case of type 0 d-branes, the various cylinder amplitudes
between an electric (or magnetic) d-brane and an electric (or magnetic) one can
simply be reproduced using the following unprojected (and dierently normalized)
boundary states, whose sum is 2 times the type ii one:

|b,i =

1
2

(|b,ins  |b,ir) .

(2.4)

here |b, +i represents an electric brane and |b,i a magnetic one.
as a cross-check, with these boundary states it is easy to compute the one-point
function on the disc of a r-r potential (as in ref. [13]). denoting by |cp+1i the
state corresponding to the (cp+1) potentials, the one-point function describing its
coupling to a type 0 dp-brane will be hb,|cp+1i. this gives indeed the same
charge as in type ii, where we would compute hb|cp+1i, as we can see from eqs
(2.1,2.3,2.4).

3 anomaly inow and wess-zumino action

the d-branes described in the previous section showed many similarities to their
type ii cousins. in this section we will push the analogy further to include the whole
wess-zumino action, i.e., all the anomalous d-brane couplings3.

the open strings stretching between two like branes are bosons, just like the
bulk elds of type 0. however, fermions appear from strings between an electric
and a magnetic brane [5]. thus one could wonder whether there are chiral fermions
on the intersection of an electric and a magnetic brane. consider such an orthogonal
intersection with no overall transverse directions. if the dimension of the intersec-
tion is two or six, a cylinder computation reveals that there are precisely enough
fermionic degrees of freedom on the intersection to form one chiral fermion.

states; see also later section 4.1.

3and the non-anomalous ones found in ref. [14]

4

in type ii string theory, the analogous computation shows that chiral fermions
are present on two or six dimensional intersections of two orthogonal branes with no
overall transverse directions. that observation has had far reaching consequences.
namely, the presence of chiral fermions has been shown to lead to gauge and grav-
itational anomalies on those intersections of d-branes [15]. in a consistent theory,
such anomalies should be cancelled by anomaly inow [16]. in the present case,
the anomaly inow is provided by the anomalous d-brane couplings in the wess-
zumino part of the d-brane action [15, 17]. these anomalous couplings have an
anomalous variation localized on the intersections with other branes.

to sketch how this anomaly inow comes about, let us focus on the case of two
type iib d5-branes (to be denoted by d5 and d5) intersecting on a string. the

r-r two-form potential and y4 a certain four-form involving the eld strength of
gauge eld on d5 and the curvature two-forms of the tangent and normal bundles

wess-zumino action on d5 contains a term of the form rd5 c2  y4, where c2 is the
of d5. to be precise, one should replace this term by rd5 h3  3, with y4 = d3

and h3 the complete gauge-invariant eld strength of c2 (which generically diers
from dc2). with the additional information that the gauge variation of the chern-
simons form 3 is given by 3 = di2 for some two-form i2, it is easy to see that
the anomalous term on d5 will have a variation localized on the intersection with
d5:

zd5

h3  3 = zd5

dh3  i2 = zd5

d  h7  i2 = zd5

d5  i2 .

(3.5)

a careful analysis of all the anomalies [17] shows that the anomalous part of the
dp-brane action is given, in terms of the formal sum c of the various r-r forms,
by

swz =

tp

 zp+1

c  e2 f +b q a(rt )/ a(rn ) .

(3.6)

here tp/ denotes the dp-brane tension, f the gauge eld on the brane and b
the ns-ns two-form. further, rt and rn are the curvatures of the tangent and
normal bundles of the d-brane world-volume, and a denotes the a-roof genus:

a(rt )
a(rn )

1843204 (tr r4

n ) + . . . .

(3.7)

this action has been checked in refs [18, 19, 20, 14] by computing various string
scattering amplitudes.

these anomalous d-brane couplings have various applications. to mention just
one, using t-duality it has been argued [21] that they imply the creation of a
fundamental string whenever certain type ii d-branes cross each other. this string
creation process is dual to the hanany-witten eect [22].

let us now return to type 0 string theory. as stated above, here chiral fermions
live on intersections of electric and magnetic type 0 d-branes. the associated

5

gauge and gravitational anomalies on such intersections match the ones for type ii
d-branes. to cancel them, the minimal coupling of a dp-brane to a (p + 1)-form
r-r potential should be extended to the following wess-zumino action:

swz =

tp

 zp+1

(c)  e2 f +b q a(rt )/ a(rn ) .

(3.8)

the  in eq. (3.8) distinguishes between electric and magnetic branes. note that
tp/ denotes the tension of a type ii dp-brane, which is 2 times the type 0
dp-brane tension.

the argument that the variation of this action4 cancels the anomaly on the
intersection is a copy of the one described above in the type ii case, apart from
one slight subtlety. for deniteness, consider the intersection of an electric and a
magnetic d5-brane on a string. varying the electric d5-brane action (exhibiting
the (c2)+ potential, or rather, its eld strength (h3)+), one nds that the variation
is localized on the intersection of the electric d5-brane with branes charged mag-
netically under the (h3)+ eld strength. using eq. (2.1), the dierent behaviour
under poincare duality of the r-r eld strengths of type ii and ii shows that these
are precisely the branes carrying (electric) (h7) charge, i.e., what we called the
magnetic d5-branes. schematically,

zd5+

(h3)+ 3 = zd5+

d(h3)+ i2 = zd5+

d (h7) i2 = zd5+

d5  i2 . (3.9)

a completely analogous discussion goes through for the variation of the magnetic
d5-brane action.

this anomaly inow argument xes (the anomalous part of) the wess-zumino
action, displayed in eq. (3.8). the presence of these terms (and of a similar non-
anomalous one [14]) can be checked by a disc computation, as in type ii [18, 20, 14].
in fact, up to the cancelling factors mentioned at the end of the previous section,
the computation is precisely the same, conrming the form of the action (3.8).

assuming t-duality to hold between type 0a/b, the arguments of ref. [21] lead
to the creation of a fundamental string when certain electric and magnetic branes
cross each other. in type ii this is linked to the hanany-witten eect [22] by a
chain of dualities. however, this chain involves s-duality, of which we do not know
a type 0 analogue.

4 type 0 branes at an orbifold xed point

in this section we want to nd the open string spectrum on a system of n electric
and n magnetic type 0 d-branes at an orbifold xed point. as in section 2 the
type 0 situation closely parallels the well-understood type ii case.

4again, to be precise, as in type ii [15, 17] one should use an action expressed in terms of the

r-r eld strengths instead of the potentials, which is dierent from eq. (3.8).

4 orbifold. (b) its type 0 counterpart:
the links drawn with solid lines correspond to bosons, the other ones to fermions.

in type iib theory, d5-branes sitting at the singularity of a c2/ orbifold are
dened by d5-brane congurations on the covering space c2. here and below 
denotes a discrete subgroup of su(2). the denition is such that the action of  is
extended to include the (open string) chan-paton factors. let us take  = n for
concreteness. to describe n d5-branes on this orbifold, one starts with nn d5-
branes on c2, reecting that if a point p is an allowed open string endpoint, then so
are its image points under the orbifold group. the open string sector thus consist of
a vector a ( = 0, . . . 5) and 4 scalars x i (i = 6, . . . 9) in the adjoint of su(nn).
n is diagonal on the complex scalars x = x 6 + ix 7 and
the spacetime action of
y = x 8 + ix 9: its generator sends (x, y ) into (x, 1y ), where n = 1. this
geometrical action is then supplemented by an action on the chan-paton factors.
first divide the nn  nn hermitian chan-paton factor into n  n blocks, say
ij, i, j = 1 . . . n. in an appropriate basis the generator g of
n is taken to act as
g(ij) = ijij, corresponding to the regular action of
n on both indices. as usual
in open string theory the orbifold projection is then performed so as to retain only
n invariant states. after dimensional reduction from d = 6 to d = 4, one nds the
following n = 2, d = 4 supermultiplets. there are n vector multiplets for dierent
su(n) groups, and n hypermultiplets that transform each in the bifundamental of
a couple of su(n) factors, as encoded in a type ii quiver diagram [10], see fig.
1(a): each dot represents a vector multiplet in one of the su(n) factors and each
link a bifundamental half hypermultiplet.

next, let us consider the analogous situation for n electric and n magnetic
type 0 d-branes. as discussed in ref.
[3] for the at space case, one starts with
2n type ii d-branes, derives the type ii open string spectrum next, and nally
performs a ()fs i projection to nd the type 0 spectrum. fs is the space-time
fermion number and i acts as conjugation by 3 in the space of n  n blocks
obtained by separating each group of 2n type ii branes into n electric and n
magnetic type 0 ones. the type 0 eld content is as follows. the massless bosons
are:

7

 1 vector and 2 real scalars in the adjoint of each of the n su(n)  su(n)

factors of the gauge group;

 n complex scalars, each in the representation ((n, 1), ( n, 1)) + (( n, 1), (n, 1))
of two su(n)  su(n) factors, as encoded in a type 0 quiver diagram, wich
we will introduce shortly, see fig. 1(b).

the massless fermionic content consists of:

 2 weyl fermions in the (n, n ) + ( n , n) of each su(n) su(n) group factor;
 n weyl fermions, each in the ((n, 1), (1, n)) + (( n, 1), (1, n)) of a couple of

gauge factors as encoded in the type 0 diagram of fig. 1(b).

the type 0 quiver diagram that summarizes the information about the spectrum
requires only a slight modication of the quiver rules in ref. [10]. for instance, in
n case, one draws n pairs consisting of a lled and an empty dot, representing
our
the groups of electric and magnetic branes, respectively; one then draws oriented
links between any two dots inside one pair or in neighbouring pairs. the spectrum
can be read o using the following rules:

1. every dot represents the bosonic content of an su(n) vector multiplet;

2. every link connecting two like dots corresponds to spacetime bosons;

3. every link between an empty and a lled dot corresponds to spacetime fermions;

4. a link represents the bosonic or fermionic truncation of either a vectormultiplet
(in the case of links within a pair) or half a hypermultiplet (for links from one
pair to a neighbouring one), transforming in the bifundamental of the gauge
groups corresponding to the dots it connects.

4.1 closed string description

as we saw in section 2, in terms of unprojected r and ns boundary states one can
with equal ease describe type ii and type 0 d-branes. one can thus directly compute
in the closed string channel the one-loop open string free energy that encodes the
free spectrum of the gauge theory on the branes, both for type ii and for type
0. we give now in some detail the closed-string description of the conguration
treated above, namely d-branes sitting at an orbifold singularity (see also [23]); in
particular, we will show how to incorporate the non-trivial action of the orbifold
group on the chan-paton factors. as far as we know, this prescription is new, also
in the type iib context.

let us thus consider d5-branes on c2/ n. the theory possesses n closed string
sectors, distinguished by the periodicity properties of the elds (see, e.g., ref. [24]):

{x, y, x, y }(,  + 2) = {lx, ly, lx, ly }(, ) .

(4.10)

8

generically, the modings of the left and right moving oscillators, {, , , } and
{ , , , }, are shifted from integer values: ,   + l/n and ,    l/n
(plus of course an additional shift of 1/2 for the fermionic oscillators in the ns
sector). in the following we give explicit expressions for the x and x parts only.
a d5-brane localized at the orbifold xed point is represented in the l-th twisted

sector by a boundary state that satises5
(x (l) + x (l))| =0|b; li = 0 ,

((l) + i (l))| =0|b; li = 0 ,

(4.11)

plus conjugate relations and plus appropriate counterparts on y, y and y , y .

the solution to these conditions in terms of oscillators6 is, writing |b; li as the

product |bb; li  |bf, ; lir,ns of a bosonic and a fermionic part,
(cid:17)|0i ,
(cid:17)|0i ,

|bf, ; lir,ns = exp(cid:16)i x

|bb; li = exp(cid:16)x

   i x



 



 



+ x

(4.12)

where the modings are as indicated below eq. (4.10) and, as usual, the fermionic
part of the boundary state depends on the additional sign .

suppose now to have nn d-branes, which for our purposes we can represent by
nn boundary states, labeled by chan-paton indices. in the case we are interested
in, we group the d5-branes into n bunches and use a chan-paton composite label
i, a, with i = 0, . . . , n and a = 1, . . . , n.
in the type 0 context, we start with
a = 1, . . . , 2n and we split it into a = 1, . . . , n, for the n electric branes and
a = 1, . . . , n for the magnetic ones.

the cylinder amplitude between any two given d-branes, i.e., for xed chan-
in summing
paton indices, receives contributions from all the twisted sectors.
for each chan-paton label we can
the twisted sectors, an ambiguity shows up:
independently decide how to weigh the twisted sectors. this is the closed string
counterpart of the freedom one has in the open string picture to introduce a non-
trivial action of the orbifold group on the adjoint chan-paton factor. in the c2/ n
case, the regular action (i, a; j, b)  ij(i, a; j, b) of the orbifold generator described
at the beginning of section 4 is reproduced in the closed string language by dening

5here and below we display only those parts of the conditions on the boundary state, and of
the boundary state itself, that dier from the usual at space expressions given, e.g., in [12]. the
parts containing the elds in the neumann directions, the ghost and superghosts are unaected.
6in twisted sectors, l 6= 0, we must take into account the fact that the only  ramond 0-
modes are those in the 6 neumann directions, and modify the zero-mode part of the r boundary
states appropriately. in the ns sector, additional  zero-modes must be taken into account in the
orbifold directions when l/n = 1/2.

these expressions in powers of ei  we can count the on-shell states in the world-

particular, the only massless contributions arise when |i  j| equals 0 or 1, and the

4.2 large n conformal invariance

according to a general argument [9], large n conformal invariance, whence a van-
ishing beta function in the large n limit, is to be expected for the gauge theory on
the branes at the orbifold singularity. let us rst review the basic ingredients of
this argument. starting from a parent n = 4 theory, one can build a new theory by
taking the orbifold with respect to a discrete subgroup  of the su(4)r r-symmetry
group. if every non-trivial g   acts on a (fundamental) chan-paton index as a
traceless matrix g, the large n vanishing of the beta function in the orbifold theory
can be demonstrated to all orders. according to ref. [9] this condition on the ac-
tion of  amounts to imposing that the chan-paton indices transform in a number
of copies of the regular representation of .

let us now take the concrete example of n electric and n magnetic type 0
d3 branes at a c2/ n singularity. starting from the u(2nn) n = 4 gauge theory
corresponding to 2nn type ii branes in at spaces, the type 0 worldvolume theory
is obtained by orbifolding with 2  n. the rst factor, the one related to going
from type ii branes to type 0 electric plus magnetic branes, sits in the centre of
su(4)r, and its non-trivial generator is represented on the chan-paton factor by
i, introduced earlier in this section. the second factor is the geometrical orbifold
group and its action on the chan-paton factors is taken to be regular, as explained
at the beginning of this section. we are thus taking the orbifold with respect to a
discrete subgroup of (a su(2) subgroup of) su(4)r, whose representation on the
chan-paton factors meets the above condition. thus a large n vanishing beta
function is expected.

as a specic check we have evaluated the 2-loop beta function explicitly, taking
the eld content of section 4 as basic input. as expected, that spectrum was seen
to yield a large n vanishing beta function up to two loop order.
