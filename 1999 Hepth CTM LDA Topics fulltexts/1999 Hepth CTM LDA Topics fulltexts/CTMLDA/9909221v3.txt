abstract

the recently proposed physical projector approach to the quantisation of gauge invariant sys-
tems is applied to the u(1) chern-simons theory in 2+1 dimensions as one of the simplest
examples of a topological quantum eld theory. the physical projector is explicitely demon-
strated to be capable of eecting the required projection from the initially innite number
of degrees of freedom to the nite set of gauge invariant physical states whose properties are
determined by the topology of the underlying manifold.

introduction

the general gauge invariance principle pervades all of modern physics at the turn of this century,
as a most basic conceptual principle unifying the elds of algebra, topology and geometry with
those of the fundamental interactions of the elementary quantum excitations in the natural uni-
verse. this fascinating convergence of ideas is probably nowhere else better demonstrated than
within the recent developments of m-theory as the prime (and sole) candidate for a fundamental
unication[1]. given the many mathematics and physics riches hidden deep into the structures
and dynamics of gauge invariant theories, a thorough understanding sets a genuine challenge to
the methods developed over the years in order to address such issues. for example, a manifest
realisation of the gauge invariance principle requires the presence among the degrees of freedom
of such systems of redundant variables whose dynamics is specied through arbitrary functions
characterizing the gauge freedom inherent to the description. this situation leads to specic
problems, especially when quantising such theories, since some gauge xing procedure has to be
applied in order to eectively remove in a consistent way the contributions of gauge variant states
to physical observables. most often than not, such gauge xings suer gribov problems[2, 3, 4],
which must properly be addressed if one is to correctly account for the quantum dynamics of
gauge invariant systems, certainly within a non perturbative framework. among gauge theories,
topological quantum eld theories[5, 6] provide the most extreme example of such a situation,
since their innite number of degrees of freedom includes only a nite number of gauge inva-
riant physical states, whose properties are in addition solely determined by the topology of the
underlying manifold irrespective of its geometry.

in a recent development[7], a new approach to the quantisation of gauge theories was
proposed, which avoids from the outset any gauge xing and thus any issue of the eventuality of
some gribov problem[8]. this approach is directly set within the necessary framework of diracs
quantisation of constrained systems[4]. no extensionwith its cort`ege of ghosts and ghosts for
ghostsor reduction of the original set of degrees of freedom is required, as is the case for all
approaches which necessarily implement some gauge xing procedure with its inherent risks of
gribov problems[4]. nonetheless, the correct representation of the true quantum dynamics of the
system is achieved in this new approach, which uses in an essential way the projection operator[7]
onto the subspace of gauge invariant physical states of a given gauge invariant system. some of
the advantages of the physical projector approach have already been explored and demonstrated
in a few simple quantum mechanical gauge invariant systems[9, 10]. in the present work, we wish
to illustrate how the same methods are capable to also deal with the intricacies of topological
quantum eld theories which, even though possessing only a nite set of physical states, require
an innite number of degrees of freedom and states for their formulation.
indeed, it will be
shown that the physical projector precisely eects this required projection.

the specic case addressed here as one of the simplest possibilities, is that of the pure
chern-simons theory in 2+1 dimensions with gauge group u(1). moreover, the discussion will
be made explicit when the topology of the underlying manifold is that of ir, where  is a two
dimensional compact riemann surface taken to be a 2-torus t2 for most of our considerations.
this system has been studied from quite a many dierent points of view[6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].
the consistency of the physical projector approach will be demonstrated by deriving again some
of the same results through an explicit resolution of the gauge invariant quantum dynamics
within this specic framework which avoids any gauge xing whatsoever and thus also any
gribov problem.

the outline of the discussion is as follows. sect.2 briey elaborates on the classical con-
strained hamiltonian formulation for chern-simons theories with arbitrary gauge symmetry
group. these considerations are then particularised in sect.3 to the u(1) case restricted to the

1

ir  t2 topology, enabling a straighforward fourier mode analysis of the then discrete innite
set of degrees of freedom. in sect.4, the dirac quantisation of the system is developed, leading
in sect.5 to the construction of the physical projector. these results are then explicitely used in
sect.6 in order to identify the spectrum of physical states in the u(1) theory and to determine
their coherent state wave function representations. finally, the discussion ends with conclu-
sions, while some necessary details are included in an appendix in order not to detract from the
main line of arguments.

2 classical chern-simons theories

let g be a compact simple lie group of hermitian generators t a (a = 1, 2, , dim g) and
structure constants f abc such that [t a, t b] = if abct c. in terms of the gauge connection aa
, the
action for the associated 2+1 dimensional chern-simons theory is then given by

where f a
gauge coupling constant g has been absorbed into the gauge connection aa

, 012 = +1, while nk is a normalisation factor (the usual

   aa

 = aa

as is well known, under small gauge transformations (i.e. continuously connected to the
identity transformation), the lagrangian density in (1) remains invariant up to a surface term.
for large gauge transformations however (i.e. those transformations in a homotopy class dierent
from that of the identity transformation), the action (1) changes by a term proportional to a
topological invariant, namely the winding number of the gauge transformation. consequently, at
the quantum level, invariance under large gauge transformations requires that the normalisation
factor nk be quantised, which is the reason for its notation. note also that no metric structure
whatsoever is necessary for the denition of the action (1).
indices , ,  = 0, 1, 2 are not
raised nor lowered, while the notation, though reminiscent of a minkowski signature metric, is
in fact related to the specic topology ir   considered for the three dimensional manifold.
the choice of the real line ir for the time evolution coordinate x0 is made for the purpose
of canonical quantisation hereafter, while any other type of compact topology for the three
dimensional manifold may be obtained from ir   through gluing and twisting[6].

hence, (1) denes a topological eld theory, namely a eld theory whose gauge freedom is
so large that its gauge invariant congurations characterize solely the topology of the underlying
manifold, irrespective of its geometry[5]. in the present case, this is made obvious in terms of
the associated equations of motion,

f a

 = 0  f a

 = 0 .

(2)

indeed, the modular space of at gauge connections on the base manifold is nite dimensional
and purely topological in its characterization through holonomies around the non-contractible
cycles in the manifold. quantisation of the chern-simons theory thus denes the quantisation
of a system whose conguration spacewhich actually coincides with its phase spaceis this
modular space of at connections.

the action (1) being of rst-order form in time derivatives of elds, is already in the

hamiltonian form necessary for canonical quantisation[16, 4]. indeed, we explicitely have,

s = z d3xh0aa

i nkijaa

j + aa

0 nkijf a

ij  i(cid:16)nkijaa
0(cid:17)i
j aa

,

(3)

2

where ij (i, j = 1, 2) is the two-dimensional antisymmetric symbol with 12 = +1. consequently,
the actual phase space of the system consists of the eld components aa
i (i = 1, 2) which form
a pair of conjugate variables with symplectic structure dened by the brackets

1(~x, x0), ab

{aa

2(~y, x0)} =

1

2nk

ab (2)(~x  ~y)

.

(4)

in addition, the rst-class hamiltonian of the system vanishes identically, h = 0, as bets any
system invariant under local coordinate reparametrisations, while nally the time components
aa

0 of the gauge connection are the lagrange multipliers for the rst-class constraints

(8)

the constraints a also coincide, up to surface terms, with the noether charge densities related
to the gauge symmetry. indeed, the noether currents a = nkf abcab
 are conserved for
solutions to the equations of motion,  a = 0, so that the associated charges read

.

(9)

the above conclusions based on the rst-order action (3) are of course conrmed through
an explicit application of diracs algorithm for the construction of the hamiltonian formulation
of constrained systems[4]. in particular, the brackets (4) then correspond to dirac brackets after
second-class constrainst have been solved for, while (3) then describes the so-called fundamental
hamiltonian formulation[4] of any dynamical system.
incidentally, note that surface terms
which appear in (3) and (9) are irrelevant for such a hamiltonian construction, which is in
essence a local construct on the manifold . in any case, they do not contribute when  is
without boundaries.

3 the u(1) theory on the torus

henceforth, we shall restrict the discussion to the gauge group g =u(1) and to the compact
riemann manifold  being the two dimensional torus t2. this choice is made for the specic
purpose of demonstrating that the physical projector approach is capable of properly quantising
such theories in the simplest of cases, leaving more general choices to be explored elsewhere with
the same techniques. in particular, the torus mode expansions to be specied presently may
be extended to riemann surfaces  of arbitrary genus through the use of abelian dierentials
and the krichever-novikov operator formalism[11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19]. the extension to non

3

abelian gauge groups g requires further techniques of coherent states not included in the present
discussion.

given the manifold  = t2, let us consider the local trivialisation of this topology asso-
ciated to a choice of basis of its rst homology group with cycles a and b. correspondingly, the
choice of local coordinates x1 and x2 is such that 0 < x1, x2 < 1. related to this trivialisation
of t2, elds over t2 may be fourier expanded, so that the total number of degrees of freedom,
though innite, is represented in terms of a discrete set of modes over t2. explicitely, in a real
parametrisation we have (from here on, any dependency on x0 is left implicit while the single
index a = 1 for g =u(1) is not displayed),

i

ai(~x) = p+n1=0p+n2=0 a++
+ p+n1=0p+n2=1 a+i

(n1, n2) sin 2n1x1 sin 2n2x2

.

(10)

let us emphasize that such expansions do not include the terms which would be associated to
the following modes: a+i
(0, n2) (n1, n2 = 1, 2, . . .).
similar mode expansionsto which the remark just made also appliesare obtained for any
quantity dened over t2. for the u(1) generator (~x), one has (for a non-abelian group g,
terms bilinear in the ai
(n1, n2) modes also contribute, which is the reason for our restriction
to g =u(1))

since {(~x), (~y)} = 0 in the abelian u(1) case, all the modes (n1, n2) have vanishing

(n1, n2) are given by

(13)

in order to understand how small and large gauge transformationsthe latter not being
generated by the rst-class constraint (~x)are represented in terms of these mode expansions,
let us consider the general gauge transformation of the eld a, namely a = a + , associa-
ted to the u(1) local phase transformation u (~x, x0) = ei(~x,x0). a point central to our discussion
is that the arbitrary function (~x, x0) may always be expressed as

(~x, x0) = 0(~x, x0) + 2k1x1 + 2k2x2

,

(14)

4

where 0(~x, x0) is an arbitrary periodic functioni.e. a scalar eld on t2while k1 and k2
are arbitrary positive or negative integers. indeed, any small gauge transformation is dened
in terms of some function 0(~x, x0) with (k1, k2) = (0, 0), while any large gauge transformation
(~x, x0) may always be brought to the above general form with some specic function 0(~x, x0),
the integers k1 and k2 then labelling the u(1) holonomies of the gauge transformation around
the chosen a and b homology cycles in t2. any gauge transformation thus falls into such a
in terms of the mode expansion of the
(k1, k2) homotopy class of the gauge group over t2.
gauge parameter function (14), the non-zero modes ai
(n1, n2) (n1 6= 0 or n2 6= 0, or both) are

these dierent expressions thus nicely establish that small gauge transformationsgene-
rated by the rst-class constraint (~x)modify only the non-zero modes and that large gauge
transformations only aect the zero modes of the gauge connection ai(~x). turning the argu-
ment around, one thus concludes that the system factorizes into two types of degrees of freedom,
namely the non-zero modes ai
(n1, n2) (n1 6= 0 or n2 6= 0) directly related to small gauge trans-
formations only, and the zero modes a++
(0, 0) directly related to large gauge transformations
only. moreover, the above expressions also show that it is always possible to set half the non-zero
modes to zero by an appropriate small gauge transformation, namely either the i = 1 or the i = 2
component for each of the modes ai
(n1, n2) (the choice of which of these two components is
set to zero is left open for the modes with both n1 6= 0 and n2 6= 0, but not for those modes for
which either n1 = 0 or n2 = 0). consequently, invariance under small gauge transformations
implies that the physical content of the system actually reduces to that of its zero mode sector
a++
(0, 0) (i = 1, 2) only, while the physical content of its non-zero mode sector is gauge equi-
valent to the trivial solution ai(~x) = 0 to the at connection condition f12(~x) = 0 associated
to the vanishing holonomies (k1, k2) = (0, 0). that the physics of these systems lies entirely
in their zero mode sector remains valid at the quantum level as well, as is shown hereafter (in
fact, this conclusion also extends to riemann surfaces  of arbitrary genus and for any choice
of non-abelian gauge group g[6, 11, 12, 13, 14]).

i

an identical separation also applies to the modes of the gauge parameter function (~x, x0).
as shown above, the term (2k1x1 + 2k2x2) corresponds to large gauge transformations only,
while the contribution 0(~x, x0) induces small transformations only, whose zero mode ++
(0, 0) in
fact completely decouples. indeed, the latter mode corresponds to a global phase transformation,
which for the real degrees of freedom a(~x, x0) stands for no transformation at all. in other
words, in as far as the small gauge parameter function 0(~x, x0) is concerned, one could say that
its zero mode ++
(0, 0) has in fact been traded for the (k1, k2) parameters characterizing the
holonomies of a large gauge transformation. the zero mode ++
(0, 0) for small gauge parameter
functions 0(~x) thus does not enter our considerations in any way whatsoever, and may always
be set to zero. finally, let us simply point out also that the range of each of the non-zero
modes 0
(n1, n2) is the entire real line, running from  to + (as opposed to the zero

0

(0, 0) which would have taken its values in the interval [0, 2] for example, had it

it may appear that by using the mode expansion (10), the gauge eld ai(~x) is assumed
to obey periodic boundary conditions, which would amount to implicitely assuming that ai(~x)
denes a vector eld over t2 rather than a possibly non trivial section of a u(1) bundle over t2,
the latter case being associated to the possibility of twisted boundary conditions for the compo-
nents ai(~x)[20]. however, the local trivialisation of t2 in terms of the coordinates 0 < x1, x2 < 1
does not dene a complete covering of t2, which requires at least 22 = 4 dierent overlapping
coordinate charts. moving from one chart to another implies that the gauge connection ai(~x)
changes also by gauge transformations which include large ones associated to twisted boundary
conditions. therefore, by explicitely considering in our denition of the gauge invariant system
large gauge transformations, the possibility of twisted boundary conditions is implicitely in-
cluded, and the above fourier mode decomposition of the phase space degrees of freedom ai(~x)
is fully warranted.

4 dirac quantisation

given the above mode decompositions of the hamiltonian formulation of the system dened over
the torus t2, its canonical quantisation proceeds straightforwardly through the correspondence
principle according to which brackets now correspond to commutation relations being set equal to
the value of the bracket multiplied by ih. thus, given (12), the fundamental quantum operators
are the modes ai

(n1, n2) such that

[ a1

(n1, n2), a2

(m1, m2)] =

2ih
nk

f(n1, n2)n1,m1n2,m2

,

with in particular for the zero modes,

(0, 0), a++

2

1

h a++

(0, 0)i = i

h
2nk

.

(17)

(18)

henceforth, we shall thus assume explicitely that nk > 0, with the understanding that the case
when nk < 0 is then obtained simply by interchanging the roles of the coordinates x1 and x2.
it is already possible at this stage to determine the number of quantum physical states[6].
indeed, the relations (15) and (16) show that the actual gauge invariant phase space degrees of
freedom are the zero modes a++
(0, 0) dened up to integer shifts by 2, while half the non-zero
modeseither the i = 1 or i = 2 component, depending on the given modemay be set to zero
through small gauge transformations. in other words, the actual physical phase space of the
system is a two dimensional torus of volume (2)2, an instance of a phase space which is not a
cotangent bundle as is usually the case but rather a compact manifold. the quantisation of the
system thus amounts to quantising this two dimensional torus, with the commutation relation
(18) in which h = h/(2nk) plays the role of an eective planck constant. in particular, the
total number of physical states is thus given by the volume (2)2 of phase space divided by that
of each quantum cell (2h) for the degree of freedom a++

(0, 0), namely

i

(2)2

2(h/2nk)

nk

.

(19)

consequently, the normalisation factor nk ought to be quantised with a value nk = hk/(4)
to be associated with k physical states (k = 1, 2, . . .). precisely this quantisation condition is
established hereafter by considering large gauge transformations of the system; this quantisation

6

condition will then be specied further later on when considering modular transformations of
the underlying torus t2, which then require the integer k to also be even.

the above commutation relations for the modes ai

(n1, n2) dene an innite tensor pro-
duct of heisenberg algebras. in order to set up a coherent state representation through creation
and annihilation operators associated to this heisenberg algebra, it is necessary to introduce a
complex structure on the initial base manifold t2. the necessity of introducing some further
structure on  beyond the purely topological one is also unavoidable in all other quantisation
frameworks for chern-simons theories[6]. in fact, all other approaches require a metric structure
on , while it is then shown that the quantised system nevertheless depends only on the complex
structure (or conformal class of the metric) on , with the space of gauge invariant physical states
providing a projective representation of the modular group of  due to a quantum conformal
anomaly[6]. this is how close a topological quantum eld theory may come to being purely
topological. in the present approach, the necessity of introducing a complex structure over  is
thus seen to arise from a coherent state quantisation of the system, while, in contradistinction to
other quantisation methods, it is also gratifying to realise that no further structure is required
within this approach since the quantised system should in any case turn out to be independent
of any such additional structure.

on t2, a complex structure is characterized through a complex parameter  = 1 + i2
whose imaginary part is strictly positive, (2 > 0), with the modular group p sl(2, zz) of
transformations generated by (t :    + 1) and (s :   1/ ) dening the classes of
inequivalent complex structures under global dieomeorphisms in t2. associated to the complex
parametrisation,

given the choice of complex structure parametrised by  , the annihilation operators for

one has

[(n1, n2), (m1, m2)] = n1,m1n2,m2

,

(24)

while the annihilation (resp. creation) operators clearly correspond, up to normalisation, to the
fourier modes of az(z, z) (resp. az(z, z)).

an overcomplete basis of the space of quantum states is then provided by the coherent

states,

|z(n1, n2) >= y yn1,n2

11 = z y yn1,n2



|z(n1, n2) >< z(n1, n2)|

,

(26)

where z(n1, n2) are arbitrary complex variables and |0 > is the usual fock vacuum normalised
in particular, the gauge invariant physical states of the system are
such that < 0|0 >= 1.
those superpositions of these coherent states which are annihilated by the rst-class operator
(~x), namely by all the modes (n1, n2). however, this restriction does not yet account
for invariance under large gauge transformations, which are not generated by the constraint
operator (~x), a further specication to be addressed in the next section.

one could now proceed and solve for the physical state conditions (~x)| >= 0 in terms
of the above mode decompositions. however, we shall rather pursue the physical projector path,
which will enable us to solve these conditions by at the same time also determining the wave
functions of the corresponding physical states, and including the constraints which arise from
the requirement of invariance under large gauge transformations as well. nonetheless, let us
note that the resolution of the physical state conditions (~x)| >= 0 has been given in ref.[11]
precisely using the functional coherent state representation of the algebra of the eld degrees of
freedom, to which we shall thus compare our results. the approach of ref.[11, 12] however, uses
the formal manipulation and resolution of the functional dierential equations expressing the
physical state conditions in the coherent state wave function representation of the commutation
relations for the eld operators az(z, z) and az(z, z). by working rather in terms of fourier
modes as done here in the case of the torus t2, such formal manipulations are avoided by
having only a discrete innity of such operators, thus leaving only the much less critical issue
of evaluating discrete innite products of normalisation factors for quantum states, for which
-function regularisation techniques will be applied (since other regularisations would require
some physical scale, hence some geometry structure to be introduced on t2).

5 the physical projector

in order to construct the physical projector, which in eect projects out from any state its gauge

(30)

law is obeyed for large gauge transformations,

u (1, 2) u (k1, k2) = u (1 + k1, 2 + k2)

.

(32)

sinceusing the property in (43)the latter constraint translates into the cocycle condition

e4i2 nk

h [1k22k1] c(1, 2) c(k1, k2) = c(1 + k1, 2 + k2)

(33)

(34)

where k = 1, 2, . . . is some positive integer value. this specic result for the normalisation factor
nk will thus be assumed henceforth.

these results therefore establish that consistency of the quantised system under the ac-
tion of large gauge transformations in its zero mode sector a++
(0, 0) requires the quantisation
of the normalisation factor nk in precisely such a manner that a total of k gauge invariant
physical states are expected to exist within the entire space of quantum states generated by
in addition, the operator u (k1, k2) associated to the
the coherent states constructed above.
large gauge transformation of holonomy (k1, k2) is thereby totaly specied, while the opera-

tor u (0) = exp(cid:16)i/hrt2

function 0(~x) is dened in (27).

consequently, the projector onto gauge invariant physical states should simply be con-
tructed by summing over all small and large gauge transformations the action of the operators
u (0) and u (k1, k2) just described. even though this is straighforward for the large gauge

9

transformations, the summation over the small ones still requires some further specications[7],
stemming from the fact that the spectrum of the non-zero modes of the gauge constraint (~x) = 0
is continuous. since, as was seen previously, the small gauge invariance is such that half the
non-zero modes ai
(n1, n2) (n1 6= or n2 6= 0) may be set to zero, the other half being their
conjugate phase space variables, let us discuss this specic issue in the following much simpler
situation.

consider a single degree of freedom system with coordinate q and conjugate momentum p,
both hermitian operators, whose commutation relation is the usual heisenberg algebra [q, p] = i,
and subject to the rst-class constraint q = 0. the spectrum of this latter operator being
continuous, the proper denition of a projector onto the states satisfying this constraint requires
to consider rather the projector onto those states whose q eigenvalues lie within some interval
[, ],  > 0 being a parameter whose value may be as small as may be required[7]. the latter
projector is expressed as,

ei   ei [ < q < ] = z 



dq |q >< q| = z +



d ei q sin()



,

(35)

assuming that the position eigenstates are normalised such that < q1|q2 >= (q1  q2). by
construction, one has the required properties,

ei 2

 = ei 

, ei  = ei 

.

(36)

however, one would rather wish to consider the operator singling out the |q = 0 > component
of any state, namely,
(37)

.

ei 0 = |q = 0 >< q = 0|

even though this operator is indeed hermitian, it is not strictly in involution since one has,

ei 2

0 = (0) ei 0

.

(38)

in other words, since the position eigenstates of the q operators are non normalisable, the
operator ei 0 does not dene a projection operator in a strict sense, since even though it projects
onto the |q = 0 > component, it leads thereby to a non normalisable state satisfying the
constraint q = 0. nevertheless, the non normalisable projector ei 0 may be constructed from the
well dened one ei  through the following limit,

ei 0 = lim
0

1
2

ei  = z +



d

ei q

.

(39)

hence, associated to the choice of normalisation of position eigenstates < q1|q2 >= (q1  q2),
the non normalisable projector ei 0 onto the states such that q| >= 0 is simply represented by
the integral operator on the r.h.s. of this last identity.

transcribing these considerations to the u(1) chern-simons theory, it should be clear that
the (non normalisable) projector onto the (non normalisable) gauge invariant physical states of
the system is simply given by (recall that the modes ++
(n1, 0)
and 0

(0, n2) are non existent)

(0, n2), 0

note that this physical projector also denes the physical evolution operator of the system, since
the rst-class hamiltonian operator vanishes identically, h = 0, a consequence of invariance
under local coordinate transformations in .

6 gauge invariant physical states

the set of physical states of the system should now be identiable simply by applying the
physical projector ei 0 onto the entire space of states representing the operator algebra of modes
ai
(n1, n2). working in the basis (25) of coherent states |z(n1, n2) >, this is tantamount to
considering the diagonal matrix elements < z(n1, n2)|ei 0|z(n1, n2) >, since these matrix
elements simply reduce to a sum of the physical state contributions as intermediate states,
namely,

< z(n1, n2)|ei 0|z(n1, n2) > = pr < z(n1, n2)|r >< r|z(n1, n2) >

(41)

= pr |< r|z(n1, n2) >|2

,

where r is a discrete or continuous index labelling all physical states (only a nite number k of
which are expected, of course). therefore, when having obtained an expression for the diagonal
matrix elements < z(n1, n2)|ei 0|z(n1, n2) > as a sum of modulus squared quantities, the
physical states of the system together with their coherent state wave function representations
are readily identied up to a physically irrelevant phase factor, knowing that except for the
factor e|z(n1,n2)|2/2 for each mode stemming from the normalisation of the coherent states,
the wave functions < r|z(n1, n2) > are necessarily functions of the variables z(n1, n2)
only, but not of their complex conjugate values z(n1, n2). had the system possessed some
global symmetry beyond the u(1) gauge invariance, the associated dierent quantum numbers
of the physical states could have used to label them, thereby making it easier to identify them
as well as their wave functions from the above matrix elements suitably extended to include
the action of the global symmetry generators[9]. note also that trying to extract the same
informationbeginning with the number of physical statesfrom the partition function tr ei 0
would be problematic. indeed, that latter quantity is ill-dened since neither the physical states
|r > nor the physical projector ei 0 are normalisable quantities.
given that the exponential arguments appearing in the denition of the gauge operators
u (0) and u (k1, k2) are linear in the creation and annihilation operators ()(n1, n2), the
explicit evaluation of the above diagonal coherent state matrix elements of the physical projector
ei 0 is rather straighforward even though not immediate for the modes with n1 6= 0 and n2 6= 0.
let us only give the outline of the calculation for the modes with n1 = 0 or n2 = 0. that
for the modes with n1 6= 0 and n2 6= 0 is similar but involves some matrix algebra since the
integrations over ++
(n1, n2)
on the other, are coupled to one another in each case.

consequently, in the case of the matrix elements < z(n1, n2)|ei 0|z(n1, n2) >, the
integrations over the discrete innite number of non-zero modes 0
(n1, n2) (n1 6= 0 or n2 6= 0,
or both) for small gauge transformations simply correspond to gaussian integrals for each of these
contributions, whose results are then multiplied with one another. as mentioned previously, the
ensuing discrete innite products of normalisation factors are handled using -function regu-
larisation techniques, rendering these products well dened. moreover, the discrete innite
products of the remaining gaussian factors may be expressed as a simple exponential whose
argument is given by the integral over the torus t2 of a local quantity built from the modes
z(n1, n2) dening the coherent state |z(n1, n2) > for which the diagonal matrix element is
evaluated.
similar considerations apply to the contribution from the zero mode sector z++(0, 0), but
the summation over the holonomies (k1, k2) is such that no clear separation of terms in the
form of (41), corresponding to the separate contributions of the distinct physical states, appears
to be feasable.
in fact, the evaluation of the zero mode sector contribution to the relevant
matrix elements requires an entirely dierent approach, which is detailed in the appendix and
uses dierent representations of the zero mode algebra (18). in particular, it is shown in the
appendix that the total number of physical states is indeed equal to the value of the integer
k which quantises the normalisation factor nk in (34), so that the index r introduced in (41)
takes the following nite set of values, r = 0, 1, . . . , (k  1).

in order to give the nal result of all these calculations in a convenient form, let us
introduce the following quantities associated to the complex parameters z(n1, n2) (see (22)
and (23))

these wave functions coincide with those established in ref.[11] by using a functional
representation of the commutations relations of the eld degrees of freedom ai(~x) in order
to solve for the physical state condition (~x) = 0 as well as requiring invariance under large
gauge transformations. this identity of results thus demonstrates that the physical projector
approach is indeed capable, without any gauge xing procedure whatsoever and thereby avoiding
the possibility of any gribov problem, to properly identify the actual gauge invariant content of
a system, even when this requires the projection down to only a nite number of components
from an initially innite number of states.

by construction, the states whose coherent state wave functions are given in (51) are
invariant under both large and small gauge transformations. however, this property does not
necessarily imply that the wave functions themselves are invariant under arbitrary gauge trans-
formations of the variables az(z, z). to make this point explicit, let us consider the gauge
transformations of the physical states, whose invariance should thus imply the following identi-
ties,

< r| u1(0)|az(z, z) > = < r|az(z, z) > ,
< r| u1(k1, k2)|az(z, z) > = < r|az(z, z) > ,

(52)

13

valid both for small and large gauge transformations u (0) and u (k1, k2) whatever the values
of their modes 0

(n1, n2) or their holonomies (k1, k2).

in the case of small gauge transformations, a careful analysis of the contributions to the

relevant matrix elements establishes the result,

where az(z, z) + z(z, z) stands for the transformations of the modes az

combining these two relations and using the identity in (50) after integration by parts
in the exponential factors (to which the zero mode a++
(0, 0) does not contribute), the rst
identity in (52) then indeed follows, thereby conrming gauge invariance of the physical states
under small gauge transformations.

(n1, n2)
under the large gauge transformation of holonomies (k1, k2) which of course aects only the zero
mode a++
(0, 0) by the indicated constant shift linear in k1 and k2. consequently, these two
relations also lead to the the second identity in (52), thereby establishing gauge invariance of
the physical states under large gauge transformations as well.

z

these relations also demonstrate that in spite of the gauge invariance of the physical
states |r > (r = 0, 1, . . . , k  1) under small and large transformations, u (0)|r >= |r > and
u (k1, k2)|r >= |r >, their coherent state wave functions < r|az(z, z) > are not invariant by
themselves under the simple substitution of the gauge variation of their argument az(z, z),
namely the variations az(z, z) = az(z, z) + z(z, z) for small gauge transformations and
az(z, z) = az(z, z)  i( k1  k2)/2 for large ones.

let us now turn to the issue of modular invariance of the physical content of the quantised
system.
if indeed this content depends only on the complex structureparametrised by the
variable  as the only structure necessary beyond the mere topological one of the underlying
torus t2, the spectrum of physical states should remain invariant under the modular group
p sl(2, zz) of t2 which is generated by the transformations

t :

   + 1

, s :

.

(57)

indeed, these transformations correspond to global dieomorphismsnamely dehn twistsin
the local trivialisation of t2 characterized through the choice of holonomy basis (a,b) and the

14

associated coordinates 0 < x1, x2 < 1, and these modular transformations dene equivalences
classes for the values of  which correspond to a same complex structure (or conformal class)
on t2.

an explicit analysis of the transformation properties of the physical wave functions (51)
shows that the requirement of invariance of the physical content of the system under the t mo-
dular transformation is met only if the integer k also takes an even value (see the appendix)[11],
in which case one nds,

t : < r|az(z, z) >  ei/12 eir2/k < r|az(z, z) > .

(58)

on the other hand, invariance under the s modular transformation is realised through the
transformations,

(60)

hence, in addition to the quantisation condition nk = hk/(4) imposed on the normali-
sation factor nk by the requirement of invariance under large gauge transformations, modular
invariance of the theory requires also that the integer k be even[11]. in this case the space of
quantum physical states does provide an irreducible representation of the t2 modular group,
showing that the physical content of the system does indeed depend only on the choice of com-
plex structure (or conformal class) on t2 characterized through the equivalence class under the
modular group of the parameter  . nevertheless, physical states are not individually modular
invariant, but rather they dene a projective representation of the modular group. this is how
close the quantised u(1) chern-simons theory is to being a purely topological quantum eld
theory, the dependency on a complex structure on t2 following from the existence of a conformal
anomaly at the quantum level[6].

7 conclusions

this paper has demonstrated that the new approach to the quantisation of gauge invariant
systems[7], based on the physical projector onto the subspace of gauge invariant states, is per-
fectly adequate to handle the intricacies of topological quantum elds theories, in which only a
nite set of physical states is to remain after the innity of gauge variant congurations has been
projected away. this new approach to the quantisation of constrained systems does not require
any gauge xing procedure whatsoever and is thus free of any potential gribov ambiguity in
the case of gauge symmetries[8], in contradistinction to all other quantisation frameworks for
gauge invariant systems. another of its advantages is that the physical projector approach to
the quantisation of such theories is directly set simply within diracs formulation, where it nds
its natural place. in particular, the physical projector enables the construction of the physical
evolution operator of such systems, to which only physical states contribute as intermediate
states, so that the physical content may be identied directly from the matrix elements of that
evolution operator, including the wave functions of physical states. for topological eld theories,
since these systems are invariant under local dieomorphisms in the base manifold, their gauge

15

invariant hamiltonian vanishes identically, in which case the evolution operator coincides with
the physical projector.

more specically, the physical projector approach was applied to the u(1) pure chern-
simons theory in 2+1 dimensions in a space whose topology is that of ir  t2, t2 being an
arbitrary two dimensional torus. through a careful analysis of the quantised system, of the
relevant physical projector, and in particular of the specic discrete innite mode content of the
system, it has been possible to identify and construct the physical spectrum and the coherent
state wave functions of the gauge invariant states, leading to results which are in complete agree-
ment with those of other approaches to the quantisation of the same system[6, 11, 12, 13, 14],
while also avoiding some of complications or formal manipulations inherent to these other ap-
proaches. the only more or less ad-hoc but unavoidable feature which is introduced in our
analysis is that the discrete innite productsrather than continuous ones as occurs in func-
tional representationsof gaussian normalisation factors have been evaluated using -function
regularisation, which avoids having to introduce any other structure on the underlying two di-
mensional riemann surface beyond those associated already to the topology and complex struc-
ture (or conformal class) of that surface. this is in keeping with the fact that the quantised
theory only depends on that complex structure but no other structure beyond it (even when one
is introduced, namely through a metric structurec[6]), while also a dependency on the complex
structure rather than purely the topology of the underlying manifold is the unavoidable conse-
quence of the quantisation of the system[6]. in particular, it was shown how gauge invariance
under large gauge transformations implies a quantisation rule for the overall normalisation of
the classical chern-simons action in terms of an integer equal to the number of physical states,
which in turn is also required to be even for modular invariance to be realised[11]. when both
these restrictions are met, the quantised system indeed only depends on the complex structure
introduced on the underlying riemann surface.

these systems are also distinguished by the fact that their physical phase space is a com-
pact manifold, in the present instance with the topology of a two dimensional torus, which is
in contradistinction to the ordinary situation in which the phase space of a given system is
a cotangent bundle. usually, geometric quantisation techniques are then invoked in order to
address the specic issues raised by a phase space having a compact topology[21]. nevertheless,
no such techniques were introduced here, but rather by properly identifying the operator which
generates the transformations responsible for such a compact topology of phase spacein the
present instance large gauge transformations, it was possible to properly represent the con-
sequences of such a circumstance using straightforward coherent state techniques of ordinary
quantum mechanics. clearly, similar considerations based on the construction of the relevant
projection operator are of application to any system whose phase space includes a compact ma-
nifold which is an homogeneous coset space g/h, g and h being compact lie algebras. from
that point of view, it may well be worthwhile to explore the potential of the physical projector
as an alternative to geometric quantisation techniques.

the physical projector approach is thus quite an ecient approach to the quantisation
of gauge invariant systems, which does not require any gauge xing procedure whatsoever and
thus avoids the potential gribov problems inherent to such procedures. some of its advantages
have been illustrated here in the instance of the u(1) chern-simons theory, as well as for
some simple gauge invariant quantum mechanical systems elsewhere[9, 10]. hence, it appears
timely now to start exploring the application[22] of this alternative method to the quantisation
of gauge invariant systems of more direct physical interest, within the context of the recent
developments surrounding m-theory compactied to low dimensions, and aiming beyond that
towards the gauge invariant theories of the fundamental interactions among the elementary
quantum excitations in the natural universe.

appendix

this appendix outlines the calculation of the contribution of the zero mode sector to the co-
herent state diagonal matrix elements < z(n1, n2)|ei 0|z(n1, n2) > of the physical projector
operator, namely the quantity

+

xk1,k2=

< z| u (k1, k2)|z >=

+

xk1,k2=

< z|eikk1k2 e

iq k
2 {[ k1k2]+[ k1k2]}|z > .

(61)

here, z,  and  stand of course for the zero mode sector only, with the obvious understanding
that usual indices distinguishing these zero modes, such as z++(0, 0), are not explicitely displayed
in this appendix.

since the evaluation of these matrix elements requires changes of bases for dierent re-
presentations of the associated quantum algebra, let us recall here the relations between the
dierent quantum operators appearing in this sector of the system. one has the denitions

,

(62)

(63)

 =

1

2s k

2 hi a1 + i a2i

,  =

while the corresponding commutation rules are

1

2s k

2 hi a1  i a2i

h a1, a2i =

2i
k

,

h, i = 1 ,

with the implicit understanding that both a1 and a2 are hermitian operators. using these
relations as well as the identity in (43), large gauge transformations also read as

u (k1, k2) = eikk1k2 eik[k1 a2k2 a1] = eikk1 a2 eikk2 a1

.

(64)

since the algebra for the modes a1 and a2 is that of the usual heisenberg algebra, with a1
playing the role of the conguration space coordinate and a2 that of the conjugate momentum
variable, it is clear from the above last expression of the operator u (k1, k2) in terms of these
modes that the mixed conguration-momentum space matrix elements of u (k1, k2) are readily
obtained. hence, let us develop the dierent representations of the commutations relations (63),
namely the conguration space, the momentum space and the coherent state ones.

conguration and momentum space representations correspond to eigenstates |a1 > and

|a2 > of the a1 and a2 operators, respectively,
a1|a1 >= a1|a1 > ,
whose normalisation is chosen to be such that

a2|a2 >= a2|a2 > ,

< a1|a1 >= (a1  a1)

, < a2|a2 >= (a2  a2)

,

to which the following representations of the identity operator are thus associated

11 = z +



da1 |a1 >< a1|

,

11 = z +



da2 |a2 >< a2|

.

(65)

(66)

(67)

since the factor h = 2/k plays the role of an eective planck constant, it is clear that the
conguration space wave function representations of the two operators a1 and a2 are simply,

< a1| a1| >= a1 < a1| > , < a1| a2| >= 

2i
k



a1

< a1| > ,

(68)

18

and for the momentum space wave function representations,

< a2| a1| >=

2i
k



a2

< a2| > , < a2| a2| >= a2 < a2| > .

(69)

in particular, given the above choice of normalisation, we have for the matrix elements expressing
the corresponding changes of basis,
k
2

, < a1|a2 >=

< a2|a1 >=

k

let us now consider the fock state representation of the same quantum algebra, whose

set of orthonormalised basis vectors is thus dened by

|n >=

1

n! (cid:16)(cid:17)n

|0 > ,

(71)

|0 > being of course the fock vacuum normalised such that < 0|0 >= 1. given the above
conguration space representation, the conguration space wave functions of the fock basis
vectors are easily constructed. for the vacuum, one nds from the condition |0 >= 0, including
proper normalisation,

while the excited fock states are such that

< a1|0 >=(cid:18) k2

u = s ik

(73)

in order to solve for these latter expressions, let us introduce polynomials pn(u; ) generalising
the usual hermite polynomials, and dened by the generating function

e 1

2 (1+)t2+(1+)tu =

tn
n!

+

xn=0

pn(u; )

,

where  is a complex parameter. these polynomials satisfy the following set of properties,

pn(u; ) = e

p0(u; ) = 1 , p1(u; ) = (1 + )u .

hence nally, one nds

similarly for the momentum wave functions, one has

|z >< z|

|z >= z|z > , < n|z >=

(80)

(81)

as well as the above generating function for the polynomials pn(u; ) which appear in the matrix
elements < a1|n > and < a2|n >, the following results are readily obtained,

< a1|z >= (cid:18) k2
< a2|z >=(cid:18) k2

having established these dierent changes of bases, let us return to the evaluation of the
matrix element (61). obviously, given (64), the mixed conguration-momentum space matrix
elements are simply,

xk1,k2=

xk1,k2=

(87)
however, in this form it is not yet possible to identify the dierent contributions of the
physical states in the form of modulus squared terms. in order to achieve that aim, let us nally
compute the conguration space matrix elements of the relevant operator, using the change of
basis < a1|a2 > above. one then obtains,
u (k1, k2)|a1 >= r +

da2 < a1|a2 >< a2|p+k1,k2=

u (k1, k2)|a1 >



k (cid:17) p+n1= (cid:16)a1  2n2

k  2n1(cid:17)i

.

(88)

< a1|p+k1,k2=
k p+n2=h(cid:16)a1  2n2

= 2

having thus obtained the conguration space matrix elements of the zero mode physical
projector operator, let us nally apply it onto any state of this sector of the quantised system.
introducing the conguration space wave function

| >= z +



da1 |a1 >< a1| >=z +



da1 |a1 > (a1)

, (a1) < a1| > ,

(89)

one readily derives,

< a1|p+k1,k2=
k p+n2= h(cid:16) 2n2

u (k1, k2)| >= r +
k (cid:17) p+n1= (cid:16)a1  2n2

 da1 < a1|p+k1,k2=

k  2n1(cid:17)i

.

(90)
in particular, since physical states are to be invariant under the action of the physical projector

u (k1, k2), they should thus obey the following equation,

u (k1, k2)|a1 >< a1| >

= 2

p+k1,k2=

xn2=

"(cid:18) 2n2

k (cid:19) +
xn1=

2n2

k  2n1(cid:19)# = (a1)

.

(91)

however, since this equation possesses k distinct linearly independent solutions given by

< a1|r >= r(a1) =

2
k

cr

+

xn=

(cid:18)a1 

2r

k  2n(cid:19) ,

r = 0, 1, 2, . . . , k  1 ,

(92)

where cr is some normalisation factor, it is clear that there are exactly k distinct physical
states |r > for the quantised u(1) chern-simons theory whose action is normalised with the
factor nk = hk/(4). moreover, the normalisation cr for each of these conguration space wave
functions of physical states is obtained from the obvious condition,

< a1|

+

xk1,k2=

u (k1, k2)|a1 >=

k1

xr=0

< a1|r >< r|a1 > .

(93)

the explicit resolution of this last constraint then nally provides the following conguration
space wave functions for the k physical states |r > (r = 0, 1, 2, . . . , k  1),
k  2n(cid:19) .

the coherent state wave functions < r|z > of the same states are then easily obtained,

using the associated change of basis specied by the quantities < a1|z >, namely
