(3) thanks presence degrees freedom, one might think dominant congurations singularities actually regularized zero 1 ||2. indeed, standard yang-mills action written variables reads = 1 4g2 z d4x f 2 = 1 4g2 z d4x { 2 + n n (d)(d)] n n (d)(d) x6= + 2  h } + { - term}, (4) 2 1 g = c c; = + i, h = (n n n); = ( ic). (5) (6) case wu-yang monopole, singularity energy origin comes behavior h 2 ij = 2/r4. note local u(1) invariance (corresponding su(2) gauge transforma- tions form u = exp /2) manifest eq.(4). fixing direction n (by gauge transformations belonging su(2)/u(1)) n = (0, 0, 1), ex- ample, amounts abelian gauge xing: n conguration form, na = xa r , gauge transformation would introduce (apparently) singular dirac monopole, even though gauge eld conguration perfectly regular. curious feature faddeev-niemi decomposition, connection contains (x) = 1 + (x) (and (x)) naturally action depends (x) (and (x)) simple signicant way, central discussion. going main argument, let us note, following faddeev niemi, form eq.(4) suggests clear picture dierent possible phases qcd. namely, eld (x) uctuates strongly n eld, one could integrate former rst, sence renormalization group, arriving low- energy eective action qcd, f n = z d4x {2 x sef f n n + x6= (n n n)2}, (7) suggested , describing connement phase qcd ( dynamically gen- eraled mass). action two important features, one unique action containing n eld allowing hamiltonian interpretation, second, contain- ing topological solitons  could thought models gluonia. though interesting, main interest pursue ideas further. 1the term also quite elegant form, 322 z d4x f f = 642 z d4x { +  h }. 3 vice versa, dynamically n eld uctuates more, renormalization group ow would instead yield low energy action looks like f n = z d4x { g2 sef f (d)(d) + (1 ||2)2} (8) standard higgs model (describing possible higgs phase). finally, none elds uctuate strongly, one would original yang-mills action low energies: one non-abelian coulomb phase case (this case sucient number massless fermions present). though obviously over-simplied, observations show eld congu- rations contribute nonvanishing vev hi 6= 0 tend bring system higgs phase (short-ranged color electric force); connement caused congura- tions giving rise dual higgs phase (hence hi = 0). zero-energy static left-handed quark eld satises equation (we shall consider massless quarks simplicity) i(k)ij lj = 0. (9) follows standard covariant weyl equation i( ia)l = 0, (10) taken faddeev-niemi form. exact u(1) local invariance used set c0(x) = 0 above. well known dirac hamiltonian (the operator multiplying l eq.(9)) commutes total angular momentum operator, j = l + + 2 , (11) composed orbital spin angular momenta gauge su(2) spin. reason one seeks singlet zero mode general structure (l)i = 2 gl(r) + ( 2)i rahl(r). (12) functions gl(r) hl(r) satisfy coupled equations, (jl(r) rhl(r)): j l + 2 r jl r jl +  gl = 0; ] jl = 0, (13) set ck(x) = rkc(r), (14) assumed spherically symmetric forms c(r), (r), (r). let us rst consider case instanton background x0 = 0, na(x) = xa r ; (r) = 2 r2 f (x); f (x) = 1 r2 + 2 ; c(r) = (r) = 0, (15) instanton size. actually instanton conguration x0 = 0, static conguration relevant three dimensional zero mode. shall loosely refer instanton below. note monopole singularity origin smoothened zero 1 ||2 since (x) 0 (or (x) 1) r 0 0. eq.(13) immediately integrated case gives gl = er r 0 dr r = 1 r2 + 2 ; jl = 0, (16) well-known three-dimensional zero mode lefthanded fermion , related four-dimensional euclidean zero mode spectral-ow argument . instanton background x0 6= 0 allow three-dimensional fermion zero modes. note also another independent solution eq.(13) gl = 0; jl(r) = exp z r 0 dr 2 r , (17) however normalizable. course, precise form instanton background needed exis- tence normalizable fermion zero mode. essential features background (15) are: i) hedgehog form n eld; ii) behavior (r) eld (in gauge rho = 0), (0) = 0; (r) r 2 (or (r) r 1). (18) fact, rst (18) guarantees gauge conguration regular origin zero mode normalizable origin, second, means looks like monopole charge 2 distance, leads asymptotic 5 behavior fermion zero mode, gl 1/r2, compatible normalizability r . another example conguration class di-meron conguration  na(x) = xa r ; (r) = r r r(x); c(r) = (r) = 0, r(x) = log; (19) < < (2y two-meron separation). fact consider general class congurations character- istics, possibly c(r) 6= 0, (r) 6= 0, call instanton-like congurations. although one coupled equations system (gl, jl), one quite generally assume normalizable solution (gl, jl) exists c(r) suciently small. instanton-like congurations may well chiral sym- metry breaking, since collection congurations (instanton liquid ) chiral symmetry breaking vevs huruli = h drdli 6= 0 (20) nonvanishing. instanton-like congurations hand use point view connement. fact, asymptotic behavior eld means || 1 innity, suggesting instanton-like congurations tend bring system higgs phase 2. consistent general idea instantons, point-like four dimensions, nothing connement, argument based three dimensional properties congurations. consider next class congurations following characteristics: i) n eld hedgehog form na = xa/r; ii) (r) eld behaves (we set = 0 u(1) gauge transformation), namely 2see {$9805168$} recent related ideas. (0) = 0; (r) r 1, aa = (x) aij xj r2 + . . . 6 (21) (22) call regularized wu-yang monopole congurations. dierence factor 2 asymptotic behavior (x) eld compared instanton-like cong- urations, crucial. means that, one hand, (r) 0 ( 0) innity congurations consistent connement; hand, implies fermion zero modes non-normalizable (see below). note single meron conguration xed time slice xa r ; r(x); c(r) = (r) = 0, na(x) = r r(x) = log, (r) = r (23) type: fact class congurations may alternatively called meron- like congurations. (collection of) congurations indeed dominant ground state qcd, lead dual meissner eect (connement), suggested hooft, mandelstam nambu. congurations however trigger chiral symmetry breaking, since normalizable fermion zero modes case. fact assume c(r) = 0 simplicity, one solutions zero-energy equation gl = er r 0 dr r (24) normalizable innity, behaves gl 1/r. case meron conguration solution coincides one given . solution jl(r) (eq.(17)) non-normalizable case, too. again, could allow nonvanishing c(r) (r) elds, clear quite general class perturbations solutions remain non-normalizable. conclude regularized wu-yang monopoles (or rather collections those) fundamental connement nothing chiral symmetry breaking. quite remarkable one identify, analysis semiclassical fermion zero modes, two distinct complementary sets cong- urations: one (instanton-like congurations) likely chiral symmetry breaking relation connement (regularized wu-yang monopoles) likely responsible connement are, are, unre- lated chiral symmetry breaking. suggests two main nonperturbative eects qcd, connement chiral symmetry breaking, distinct eects, 7 particuar latter (chiral symmetry breaking) direct consequence former (connement). hints support conclusion lattice approach qcd . fact, conclusion overlaps considerably callan et. al. , use faddeev-niemi decomposition appears allow particularly simple way relate question chiral symmetry breaking (existence absence fermion zero modes) connement. conclude several comments. 1. fact asymptotic value quantized (in gauge (x) = 0), (r) r n, n z, (25) fundamental discussion. (25) must imposed faddeev-niemi construction. gauge n = (0, 0, 1) = 0, () represents charge magnetic monopole (see eq.(22)), obey diracs quantization condition consistency fermions present theory. noted although n eld represents 2(su(2)/u(1)) hence devided integer classes winding number s2 s2, fact alone sucient guarantee integer monopole charge. 2. analysis seems shed new light long-standing question interplay instantons monopoles qcd. although clearly totally unrelated, relations {$9506026$} rather subtle. instance, exact seiberg-witten solution  n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories, renormalization parameter due innite sum instanton contributions, dual language adequate low energies seen due perturbative loops magnetic monopoles. see also earlier related idea  recent related results nite temperature qcd {$9805168$}. 3. known connement occur without chiral symmetry breaking, exemplied many supersymmetric models, supporting idea two phenomena principle distinct. example, massless n = 1 supersymmetric qcd nf = nc + 1, low-energy degrees freedom mesons baryons superpartners (connement), chiral symmetries remain unbroken one possible vacua {$9411149$}. suggestive 8 occurs precisely theory eects instantons known relatively weak {$9411149$}. 4. work faddeev niemi generalizes earlier proposal cho {$9906198$}, required gauge connection satisfy whose solution simply dn = 0, aa (x) = cna + (n n)a. (26) (27) eld tensor decomposes sum electric magnetic parts, f = g + h; g = c c; h = (n n n), (28) h contains (wu-yang) magnetic monopole n eld hedgehog form. decomposition faddeev niemi continues share nice property, extra degrees freedom ((x)) capable accomodating larger classes regular eld congurations needed discussion. 5. actually, decomposition su(2) connection used fully general one. aa (x) expressed terms six independent functions (after taking account local u(1) invariance, one two physical degrees freedom c, two n two (x)), matches number physical degrees freedom aa (x). shown complete  sense yang-mills equations motions correctly reproduced c(x), n(x), (x). course, functional integration variables one needs two degrees freedom, faddeev-niemi decomposition accordingly generalized recently . original on-shell decomposition, however, seems contain sucient number degrees freedom (i.e., suciently wide classes congurations) purpose present exploratory study. 6. recently davies et.al.{$9905015$} computed gluino condensate pure n = 1 supersymmetric yang-mills theory, compactifying time coordinate cylinder, using gluino zero mode background standard bps monopole aa 0(x) appears higgs scalar). one might wonder whether absence fermion zero modes background regularized (x) (aa 9 wu-yang monopole noted, compatible work. fact, one repeats analysis case fermion adjoint representation gauge group, one nd pair zero modes background regularized wu-yang monopole background. simplest way get result set yukawa coupling zero original analysis jackiw rebbi . case fundamental fermion, seen normalizable jackiw-rebbi zero mode becomes non-normalizable 3, compatible absence normalizable zero modes found here. hand, (pair of) normalizable zero modes found  continue normalizable limit vanishing yukawa coupling case adjoint fermion 4 consistent calculation {$9905015$}. 7. alternative qcd quarks adjoint representation, regu- larized wu-yang congurations would lead connement chiral symme- try breaking caused types congurations. thus possible nite temperature chiral symmetry breaking occur without connement, suggested kogut et. al. , instanton-like congurations dominate wu-yang monopole like congurations. ackowledgment authors acknowledge useful discussions andrea barresi, massimo campostrini, prem kumar ettore vicari. k.t. would like thank infn, sezione di pisa, hospitality. references  y. nambu, phys. rev. d10 (1974) 4262, s. mandelstam, phys. lett. 53b (1975) 476; phys. rep. 23c (1976) 245 ; phys. rev. d19 (1978) 2391  g. hooft, nucl. phys. b190 (1981) 455  l. del debbio, a. di giacomo g. pauti, nucl. phys. b (proc. suppl.) 42 (1995) 231; 3one authors (kk) thanks h. terao discussion point. 4the asymptotic behavior zero modes change however limit: zero modes behave 1/r2, agreement result {$9905015$}. 10  l.d. faddeev a.j. niemi, phys. rev. lett. 82 (1999) 1624, hep-th 9807069  l.d. faddeev a.j. niemi, phys. lett. 449b (1999) 214, hep-th 9812090 v3  s. kronfeld, g. schierholz u.-j. wiese, nucl. phys. b293 (1987) 461  r. jackiw c. rebbi, phys. rev. d13 3398 (1976)  n. seiberg e. witten, nucl. phys. b426 (1994) 19; nucl. phys. b431 (1994) 484  k. konishi h, terao, nucl. phys. b511 (1998) 264, hep-th/9707005, g. carlino, k. konishi h. murayama, preparation  g. hooft, nucl. phys. b79 (1974) 276, a.m. polyakov, jetp lett. 20 (1974) 194  c. j. callias, commun. math. phys. 62 213 (1978), e. weinberg, nucl. phys. b167 (1980) 500, j. de boer, k. hori y. oz, hep-th/9703100 v3 (1998)  y. nambu, caltech preprint, calt-68-634 (1977)  c.g. callan, jr., r. dashen d.j. gross, phys. rev. d17 (1978) 2717  t.t. wu c.n. yang, properties matter unusual conditions, ed. h. mark s. fernbach, interscience, new york, 1969  l.d. faddeev a.j. niemi, nature 387 58 (1997), l.d. faddeev a.j. niemi, hep-th 9705176, j. gladikowski m. hellmund, phys. rev. d56 5194 (1997), r.a. battye p.m. sutclie, hep-th 9808129, r.a. battye p.m. sutclie, hep-th 9811077, h. aratyn, l.a. ferreira a.h. zimerman, hep- th/9902141 h. aratyn, l.a. ferreira a.h. zimerman, hep-th 9905079  j. kiskis, phys. rev. d18 (1978) 3690  v. de alfaro, s. fubini g. furlan, phys. lett. 65b (1977) 1631,  d.i. dyakonov v. yu. petrov, nucl. phys. b272 (1986) 457, e.v. shuryak, qcd vacuum, hadrons superdense matter, world scientic (1988)  j. kogut, j. polonyi, h.w. wyld d.k. sinclair, phys. rev. lett. 54 (1985) 1980, f. karsch m. lutgemeier, nucl. phys.
