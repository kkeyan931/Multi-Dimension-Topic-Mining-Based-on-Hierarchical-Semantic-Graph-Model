abstract

we explore the possibility of constructing p-brane world-volume actions with the
requirements of -symmetry and gauge invariance as the only input. in the pro-
cess, we develop a general framework which leads to actions interpolating between
poincare-dual descriptions of the world-volume theories. the method does not re-
quire any restrictions on the on-shell background congurations or on the dimensions
of the branes. after some preliminary studies of low-dimensional cases we apply the
method to the type iib ve-branes and, in particular, construct a -symmetric ac-
tion for the type iib ns5-brane with a world-volume eld content reecting the fact
that the d1-, d3- and d5-branes can end on it.

1 introduction

it is well established that extended objects play a fundamental role in the non-perturbative
completion of the superstring theories, and thus eective world-volume actions describing
these objects are of interest. while actions for the fundamental strings and for the m-
theory membrane [1] have been known for a long time, actions for the d-branes were
constructed somewhat more recently [26]. a further development was the observation
that these branes can equivalently be described by actions where the tension is generated
dynamically by a gauge-invariant world-volume p+1-form, fp+1. these actions have the
generic form

s =z dp+1g  [1 + ({fi})  (fp+1)2] ,

(1.1)

where {fi} collectively denotes the world-volume eld strengths (excluding fp+1), and 
is a lagrange multiplier for the constraint 1 + ({fi}) (fp+1)2  0. the world-volume
eld strengths (including fp+1) have the schematic form f = da  c  c  f . here
c  f  denote corrections to the canonical, minimally coupled form, determined by the
requirement of gauge invariance. the equation of motion for the tension gauge potential
ap leads to fp+1 = const; this constant is identied with the tension.

an appealing feature of the formulation (1.1) is that, in all known cases,  is a
polynomial function of its arguments. notice also that there is no wesszumino term in
the above action; this term is instead incorporated in the p+1-form eld strength fp+1.
whenever convenient, one can return to the formulation without the lagrange multiplier 
and the tension gauge potential ap by solving their equations of motion, thereby regaining
the wesszumino term in its traditional form.

actions of the form (1.1) were constructed for the m2-brane and the fundamental
strings in refs [7, 8] and more recently for the d-branes in ref. [9]. for the type iib
branes it is known [10] that the fundamental string (charge (1,0)) and the dirichlet string
(charge (0,1)) belong to a doublet of (p, q) strings under the non-perturbative sl(2,z)
symmetry [11] of the type iib theory. it has been shown that it is possible to construct an
action for these (p, q) strings which is manifestly covariant under the sl(2,z) symmetry
[12,13]. the d3-brane on the other hand is a singlet under the sl(2,z) symmetry. in the
action which makes this property manifest, two world-volume two-form eld strengths are
required [14]. in order to get the correct counting for the degrees of freedom, an auxiliary
duality relation between these two elds has to be imposed at the level of the equations
of motion.
in ref. [15] an action for the m5-brane was constructed which circumvents
the problems [16] associated with the self-dual world-volume three-form by implementing
the self-duality relation of this three-form as an auxiliary condition at the level of the
equations of motion. thus, in the last two cases duality relations had to be imposed to
compensate for the fact that too many elds appear in the actions; in the case of the
three-brane the introduction of extra elds was required to make a symmetry manifest,
and in the case of the m5-brane to circumvent a topological restriction. in this paper
auxiliary duality relations will be a recurrent theme.

a crucial requirement for supersymmetric boson-fermion matching of the above brane
actions is that of -symmetry, a local world-volume symmetry for which the variation
parameter  is a target-space spinor that can be written as  = p+ = 1
2 (1l+), where p
are mutually orthogonal projection operators, each reducing the number of independent
components of a spinor by half. these properties translate into the requirements tr() = 0,
and 2 = 1l. a long-standing problem has been the construction of a -symmetric action
for the type iib ve-brane.
it is known [17] that the theory on the world-volume is
described (on-shell) by a six-dimensional vector multiplet. there has been a debate in
the literature about whether this multiplet should be realised in the action as a two-form
or as a four-form eld strength (these are poincare dual, and hence have the same number
of degrees of freedom). recently, a proposal based on t-duality considerations for the
bosonic part of the action for the type iib ns5-brane action was put forward [18]. one of
the main results of the present paper is the construction of a -symmetric action for the
type iib ns5-brane in a general curved supergravity background and with a world-volume
eld content which reects the fact that the d1-, d3- and d5-branes can end on it. the
bosonic part of our action diers from the one given in ref. [18]; we will comment on this
fact in later sections.

in ref. [19] it was observed that in order to relate the action for the directly dimension-

2

ally reduced m2-brane to the action for the d2-brane, which describes the same physical
object, one has to perform a world-volume poincare dualisation of the one-form on the
world-volume of the dimensionally reduced membrane to a two-form, which can be in-
terpreted as the two-form eld-strength on the d2-brane world-volume, and vice versa.
such dualisations were shown to be required also in other interconnections between p-
brane actions [20, 21]. there are however limitations on the applicability of this method.
the extension for p > 2 to general backgrounds, where all form elds are non-constant,
was recently accomplished in ref. [22]. in the present paper we also work with general
backgrounds. the method of refs [20, 21] runs into more serious problems when p > 4,
since one then encounters fth-order algebraic equations.

in this paper we propose a general method for constructing world-volume actions with
the requirements of -symmetry and gauge invariance as the only input. to be able
to apply the method one does not need to know even the bosonic part of the action
beforehand. we work within the framework where the brane actions take the form (1.1).
the method furthermore leads to a new way of handling poincare dualisation, which in
a certain sense circumvents the above mentioned problem. the dualisation is also more
general in that it is not a z2 transformation; rather a whole set of interpolating theories
are constructed. the interpolating actions depend on certain parameters which control
the dualisation. for intermediate values of the parameters the world-volume elds are
doubled, i.e., they come in pairs with their poincare duals. in these formulations it
can be arranged so that there is a world-volume eld corresponding to every possible
brane-ending-on-another-brane case [2325], thus realising an equality among the various
possible gauge invariant world-volume eld strengths on the branes. in order to obtain the
correct number of degrees of freedom for intermediate values of the parameters auxiliary
duality relations are imposed. as a byproduct of our results we show that the form of
the usual d-brane actions is determined by supersymmetry alone (supplemented by gauge
invariance).

the fundamental requirements we impose are that the world-volume elds should be
gauge invariant and satisfy bianchi identities on the world-volume. for the type iib
branes we also require our actions to be invariant under the perturbative pecceiquinn
symmetry. all hitherto known supersymmetric brane actions are invariant under this
symmetry. furthermore, this requirement is closely related to the condition that the
world-volume eld strengths should satisfy bianchi identities.

the paper is organised as follows. in the next section we illustrate the method for the
d2-brane in the type iia theory. in section 3 we discuss the strings and the d3-brane
in the type iib theory. the construction of the action for the type iib ns5-brane is
presented in section 4; this section also contains a discussion about the d5-brane.

finally, in the appendices we describe our notation and conventions, list some proper-
ties of the ten-dimensional type ii supergravities in superspace relevant for our discussion,
and give some details about the method used to verify -symmetry of our actions. in the
latter context, we list a number of essential identities involving the world-volume eld
strengths. these identities should also be useful in applications of our results.

2 an introductory example: the d2/m2-brane

in this section we will describe the method in a simple, but non-trivial, settingthe
d2-brane in type iia. this brane can also be described as the dimensionally reduced
m2-brane; the two actions are related via a poincare-duality transformation of the world-
volume elds [19]3. this is, in fact, the way the -symmetric action for the d2-brane
was rst constructed [19]. the action for the dimensionally reduced m2-brane contains
the world-volume eld f m2
3 = da2  c3 + b2 f1 which generates the tension (here f1 =
da0  c1). similarly, an action for the d2-brane where the tension is replaced by the
world-volume eld f d2
3 = da2  c3  c1 f2 has been constructed [9] (here as usual
f2 = da1  b2).

before we continue we will briey discuss some facts about the background type iia
supergravity theory (more details can be found in appendix b). the gauge-invariant eld
strengths in the type iia theory which are relevant for the discussion in this section are
r2, h3 and r4. these elds satisfy the bianchi identities

dr2 = 0 ,

dh3 = 0 ,

dr4 = h3 r2 .

(2.1)

the rst two relations are solved by r2 = dc1 and h3 = db2, whereas there is an
ambiguity in the denition of r4; if one requires r4 to satisfy the above bianchi identity
one arrives at the natural solution r4 = dc3+x b2 r2(1x) c1 h3 = d(c3+x c1 b2)
c1 h3. from the last equality we see that the parameter x arises from an ambiguity in
the denition of c3, the most general natural eld redenition being c3  c3 + x c1 b2.
this innocent eld redenition will play a central role in the sequel. dierent values of
the parameter x describe the same physics, but, as we will see later, the corresponding
descriptions of the world-volume theories can be quite dierent. the background eld
strengths are invariant under the gauge transformations

c1 = dl0 ,
c3 = dl2  x r2 l1  (1x) h3 l0 .

b2 = dl1 ,

(2.2)

we now turn to the construction of gauge-invariant world-volume eld strengths satis-
fying bianchi identities. the general form of these eld strengths is f = daccf .
here c collectively denotes the background potentials (both the rr and the ns-ns ones)
and cf  denotes possible corrections to the minimally coupled form, required by gauge
invariance. it is easy to see that f1 = da0  c1, and f2 = da1  b2 are invariant under
the gauge transformations (2.2) together with a0 = c + l0 and a1 = dl0 + l1 (here c
is a constant), and that they satisfy the bianchi identities

3in order to obtain the m2-brane action from the d2-brane action one has to perform a world-
volume poincare-duality transformation followed by an s-duality transformation, which, given the relation
between the eleventh dimension and the dilaton [26, 27], corresponds to lifting the action to eleven
dimensions.

(2.3)

df1 = r2 ,

df2 = h3 .

4

furthermore, using the above form of r4, we see that the world-volume three-form eld
strength

obeys the bianchi identity

f3 = da2  c3 + x b2 f1  (1x) c1 f2

df3 = r4 + x f1 h3  (1x) f2 r2 ,

(2.4)

(2.5)

and is invariant under the above gauge transformations combined with a3 = dl1 + l2 +
x l1 f1 + (1x) l0 f2. thus, on the world-volume the eld redenition in the background
has a more profound implication:
it determines which world-volume eld strengths ap-
pear. we see that for x = 1 we obtain the correct tension eld for the description of
the dimensionally reduced m2-brane, whereas for x = 0 we instead nd the d2-brane
description. we thus know that the limits x = 0 and x = 1 lead to sensible results,
but what happens for other values of x? the answer to this question is given below,
where we construct an action which interpolates between the two limiting cases discussed
at the beginning of the section. the interpolation is controlled by the real parameter x
introduced above. in order for the kinetic term to be positive semi-denite, it appears
desirable to impose the physical restriction x  [0, 1]. we make a general ansatz for the
action of the form

s =z d3g h1 + (e

2 f2)  e

2

4 (f3)2i .

(2.6)

(2.7)

the dilaton dependence in this expression can be motivated by considering the dilaton-
scaling of the supergravity constraints, which, via the basic -variations, directly deter-
mine the dilaton-factor in front of each occurrence of the world-volume eld strengths.
we will from now on suppress the dilaton factors; they can be reinstated at any time by
4 f3. the equation of motion for
2 f2 and f3  e
using the rules f1  e
a3 is d[f3] = 0, whereas the ones for a0 and a1 are

d[
+ 2x b2 f3] = 0 ,

f2  2(1x) c1 f3] = 0 .

d[

by using the bianchi identities for f1 and f2 together with the result d[f3] = 0 one can
eliminate the explicit appearance of the background eld strengths:


f1  2x f2 f3] = 0 ,
+ 2(1x) f1 f3] = 0 .

it is thus consistent with the equations of motion and the bianchi identities to impose

(2.9)

where  is yet to be determined. these relations reduce the number of degrees of freedom
by half, and take care of the doubling of elds in the action. auxiliary duality relations of
this form have been used before in the literature [14, 15, 28]. for the two limiting values
x = 0 and x = 1 the duality relations (2.9) become degenerate, so that we have the
same number of degrees of freedom for all values of x, namely that of a one-form f1 (or,
equivalently, of its poincare dual f2). next we will investigate the -symmetry properties
of the action (2.6).

the -transformations of the world-volume elds can be shown to be

(2.10)

notice the close correspondence between the variations of the world-volume eld strengths
and their respective bianchi identities given in eqs (2.3) and (2.5). this correspondence
holds for all cases considered in this paper. we would now like to check whether the
action (2.6) is invariant under these transformations. to this end, it is sucient to show
that the variation of the constraint  = 1 +   (f3)2  0 is zero. however, we do
not know the form of the function . the way out of this impasse [14, 15] is to note
that if we assume that the scalar functional  is formed out of contractions between the
world-volume eld strengths and the metric only,4 a simple scaling argument shows that
the variation of  can be written5

(2.11)

this improves matters considerably since from (2.9) we have explicit expressions for k1
and k2, valid when the duality relations are imposed. hence, we are in the fortunate
situation that although we do not know the action we know its variation under a -
transformation. then, by demanding that  be -invariant, we can exploit this knowledge
to derive the action, as we shall demonstrate next.

inserting the expressions for the variations of the world-volume elds, together with

the background constraints leads to

()(1/2) = 2 f3 h + 2 f1211 + 3 f2111 + (3x) (f1 f2) + f3i ,

4we thus exclude wz-type terms linear in ijk, which is reasonable since in the formulation we are

(2.12)

using such terms are contained in f3.

5the part of this expression that is proportional to the dilaton variation was derived by temporarily
reinstating the suppressed dilaton-dependence of the action (2.6) by means of the previously given sub-
2 f2 and f3  e
4 f3. we discard an overall dilaton factor in 
stitution rules f1  e
since it can be absorbed in the lagrange multiplier .

these expressions should vanish when  is of the form p+ = 1
2(1l + ). we now face
another problem: how do we determine p+? this is a less serious problem, since there are
not that many natural terms that can appear. in all known cases one can write p+
as a p+1-form expression involving the world-volume elds and the totally antisymmetric
products of -matrices, i1...ir , considered as forms. by making a natural ansatz for p+,
inserting it into the above variations, and then using the formula (a.9) to expand the
products of i1...irs one obtains two expressions which are linear combinations of i1...ir s,
for various values of r. requiring these expressions to vanish forces each tensor component
to vanish separately, since the i1...ir s are linearly independent (for generic embeddings).
these conditions determine the expressions for the duality relations (2.9); for further
details, see appendix c. by integrating the latter we then obtain an expression for .
the projection operator which makes the above variation vanish is

2 f3 p = f3 1l  [  (1x) f1211 + xf2111] ,

(2.13)

and the result for the action is

s =z d3 g  [1 + x f1f1 + (1x) f2f2 + x (1x) f1f1 f2f2  (f3)2] , (2.14)

supplemented by the duality relations

f3 f1 = f2 + x (f1f1) f2 ,
f3 f2 = f1 + (1x) (f2f2) f1 .

(2.15)

at this point we would like to make a few comments. notice the similarity between the
bianchi identity for f3 and the form of p+; the correspondence becomes even closer if
we use the formal rules r2n  ()n2n1(11)n, h3  211. a similar correspondence
holds for all hitherto known brane actions. this correspondence, if assumed to hold in
all cases, reduces the amount of guesswork involved (basically we only had to guess the
form for p+) and makes the method more algorithmic. we will comment further on this
correspondence in later sections. in the simple case considered above one could also have
made progress by making an ansatz for ; for higher-dimensional cases this approach is
less feasible.

to summarise, in the two limits x = 0 and x = 1 we recover known results with
correct expressions for the projection operator p+. for other values of x we obtain new
-symmetric formulations of the d2-brane action. we would like to stress that these
actions are all equivalent (i.e., they describe the same physical object) as is obvious from
the way the parameter x was introduced. for the choice x = 1
2 one obtains a formulation
which treats the two world-volume elds in a symmetric fashion.

3 some further examples

the type iib d-string

the d-string in the type iib theory couples minimally to the two-form potential c2.
possible world-volume elds satisfying bianchi identities are

f0 =   c0 ,
f2 = da1  b2 ,

df0 = r1 ,
df2 = h3 ,

(3.1)

where  is a constant. in order for f0 to be invariant under the peccei-quinn symmetry,
 has to change to compensate for the constant shift of c0. we will comment on this fact
later on. given the above two elds, one can construct the following expressions for the
tension form f2:

f2 = d a1  c2 + x b2 f0  (1x) c0 f2 ,
d f2 = r3 + h3 f0  (1x) r1 f2 .

here the background eld strength r3 is dened as

r3 = dc2 + x b2 dc0  (1x) c0 db2 ,

(3.2)

(3.3)

and satises the usual bianchi identity, dr3 = r1 h3. the action is taken to be of the
form6

s =z d2 g  [1 + (f0, f2)  ( f2)2] .

(3.4)

in order to be able to apply the method of the previous section it is convenient to formally
regard  as the exterior derivative of a 1-form, a1. this procedure will be justied
later in this section. using the just mentioned formal trick, the duality relations can be
shown to be determined by

2(1x)  f2 f0 = k2 :=
2x f2 f2 = k0 :=

(3.5)

as in the case of the d2-brane, the -variation of the constraint  = 1 +  ( f2)2  0
can be written in terms of the ks:

(3.6)
the -variations of the elds are f0 = ir1, f2 = ih3 and  f2 = ir3 +
f0 ih3  (1x) f2 ir1 (the variations of the metric and the dilaton are the same as in
6as for the d2-brane we suppress the dilaton dependence; it can be reinstated by using the rules:

the d2-brane case). using these expressions together with the supergravity constraints
(see appendix b) one then obtains the expressions

()(1/2) = 2  f2 h   j + f0  k  f2 i  (1+x) f0 f2   f2i ,
()(0) = 4i f2 eih ij

p  ( f2  f0 f2)1l  [ j + (x+) f0  k + (1(x+))f2 i] .

(3.8)

following the same approach as for the d2-brane one can obtain the action; the nal
result is listed below:

s =z d2 g  [1 + x f 2

0 + (1x) f2f2 + x (1x) f 2

0 f2f2] .

(3.9)

note the similarity with the result for the d2-brane in the previous section. this fact
should be derivable from t-duality considerations.

the duality relations which supplement the above action are

 f2 f0 = f2 + x f 2
 f2 f2 = f0 + (1x) f2f2 f0 .

0 f2 ,

(3.10)

it is fairly straightforward to show that the second duality relation follows from the rst
one and the constraint 1 +  = ( f2)2, thus showing that it can be consistently imposed
and justifying the earlier formal derivation.
let us close this subsection by discussing some simple limiting cases of the above
action. when x = 0, we recover the conventional -symmetric d-string action. in the
opposite limit, x = 1,  equals 1 + f 2
0 = 1 + (  c0)2. this result agrees with the well-
known result of refs [20,21,29], where it was shown that  has the correct transformation
property under the peccei-quinn symmetry, which in particular transforms c0 to c0 + 1,
to make f0 invariant.
it was furthermore shown that the action could be interpreted
as the action for the fundamental string in an sl(2,z) transformed background; thus
establishing the s-duality connection between the d- and f-strings at the level of their
world-volume actions.

the type iib d3-brane

the complete -symmetric action for the super-d3-brane in the type iib theory was
constructed in ref. [3].
it is known that the d3-brane is a singlet under the sl(2,z)

9

symmetry of the type iib theory. this fact was demonstrated in refs [2022, 30]. an
action which makes the sl(2,z) symmetry manifest was constructed in ref. [14].

in this section we will apply our method to the type iib d3-brane, and compare our
ndings with previously known results. the parameterisations for the background eld
strengths which we will use in this section are

r1 = dc0 ,
h3 = db2 ,

r3 = dc2  c0 h3 ,
r5 = dc4 + x b2 dc2  (1x) c2 h3 .

(3.11)

notice that we have not introduced a parameter in the denition for r3, in contrast to
the case of the d-string. we will only introduce parameters which lead to (poincare)
dual pairs of world-volume eld strengths. this is, in general, a restriction; it is unclear
whether it excludes any physically interesting cases. the introduction of a parameter in
the expression for r3 would have lead to the appearance of f0 in various places, but there
is no corresponding four-form to which it can be dual (recall that for the d-string there
where two two-forms). given the above parameterisation the possible gauge invariant
world-volume elds and their bianchi identities become

f2 = da1  b2 ,
f2 = d a1  c2  c0 f2 ,
f4 = da3  c4 + x b2 f2  (1x) c2 f2 + x c0 b2 f2 + (x 1
df4 = r5 + x h3 f2  (1x) f2 r3 + (x 1

there is an alternative way of looking at the parameter x in f4 above. consider the
expression f d3
4 = da3 
c4  c2 f2. by making the eld redenitions c4  c4 + x b2 c2 together with a3 
a3  xa1 d a1, we recover the expression for f4 given above. thus, at the world-volume
level the dualisation is performed by adding the term f2 f2 to f4. this is analogous to
the way one usually proceeds. looking at the dualisation this way leads to an easy way
of determining which eld parameterisations are needed for the background elds.

this form of the action is more convenient for the derivation of the duality relations
consistent with the bianchi identities and the equations of motion. in the present case
these duality relations must be of the form

(3.16)

in order for the action (3.14) to be -invariant it is sucient that the constraint  =
1 + (f2, f2)  (f4)2  0 is invariant. by using the same argument as before we can
rewrite the -variation of the constraint in terms of the ks as

(3.17)

by inserting the expressions (3.16) for the ks and using the variations (3.13) of the
world-volume elds together with the on-shell constraints for the background elds, we
obtain

()(1/2) = 2 f4 h 1

again we note the similarity with the bianchi identity (from this perspective the free
parameter  can be understood from the fact that the bianchi identity for f4 can be
rewritten as d(f4  f2 f2) = r5 + (x + )h3 f2  [1  (x + )]f2 r3 + [(x + )

2 ]r1 f2 f2 ). inserting the above expression for  = p+ into the variations (3.18) and
using the expansion formula (a.9) for the product of two -matrices, we obtain a set of
component expressions which must each vanish in order for -symmetry to hold. the

nal results of the investigation of these expressions are the duality relations (for further

(3.21)

this action is -invariant for all values of the parameter x. the value x = 0 corresponds
to the usual d3-brane action with the standard projection operator, a result we have
arrived at using only the requirements of  and gauge invariance. in this limit there is no
need for the duality relations since they just dene f2 in terms f2, but f2 appears neither
in the action nor in the projection operator. as a consequence, the duality relations
can simply be dropped in this case. another interesting value is x = 1. in this limit
the action is also of born-infeld form, but with f2 as the world-volume eld. however,
unlike f2 in the limit x = 0, f2 does not decouple completely, since the action depends
implicitly on f2 through f2 and f4. the explicit dependence of f2 in p+ can be removed
by using the identity (c.9), but the implicit dependence remains. it is nevertheless true
that the equation of motion for a1 becomes non-dynamical, as can be demonstrated in
the following way. when x = 1, the equation of motion for a1 is

d(cid:20)(cid:26)2f4 f2 

 f2(cid:27) c0(cid:21) = 0 .


(3.22)

here the expression in curly brackets vanishes trivially as a consequence of the duality
relations. the action in the limit x = 1 diers from the dual action derived in refs [20,21].
the reason for this discrepancy is that the dual eld of refs [20, 21] does not satisfy a
bianchi identity, nor is it invariant under the peccei-quinn symmetry. it thus violates
two of our basic assumptions. we can reproduce the results of refs [20, 21] by solving the
duality relations to eliminate f2 at the level of the equations of motion and then integrate
the result to an action; this action agrees with the one derived earlier using conventional
poincare dualisation.

yet another interesting case is x = 1

2. this is the most symmetrical choice for the pa-
rameter x, and the corresponding action is, as one might suspect, related to the manifestly
sl(2,z)-covariant action constructed in ref. [14]. more precisely, the action (3.21) with
x = 1
2 is a gauge-xed version of the manifestly sl(2,z)-covariant action constructed in
ref. [14] and can easily be lifted to the latter. in the manifestly covariant formulation the
two world-volume eld strengths are combined into a single complex eld, f = u rf2;r,
which by construction is invariant under sl(2,z) but transforms under the (local) u(1)

12

1

symmetry of the background theory.8 here f2;r = da1;r  c2;r transforms as a doublet
under sl(2,z), where c2;1 = b2, c2;2 = c2 and similarly for a1;r. by choosing the u(1)
gauge u 1 = e
2 f2. implementing
this relation in the action leads to complete agreement with the results of ref. [14] (after
taking into account the dierences in conventions for f4 and r5). we have thus explic-
itly shown in a simple way that the usual d3-brane action and the manifestly covariant
action [14] describe the same physical objectthe d3-branewhich is a singlet under
sl(2,z).

4 the type iib 5-branes

in type iib supergravity in its doubled formulation there are two six-form gauge potentials,
c6 and b6, which are dual to the two-form potentials c2 and b2, respectively. the six-
form potentials couple minimally to two dierent branes: the d5-brane and the ns5-
brane. below we will discuss these two objects using the method outlined in previous
sections. we will be somewhat more elaborate in our treatment of the ns5-brane as this
is the most interesting and novel case.

the type iib d5-brane

the d5-brane couples minimally to the six-form potential c6. the standard form of the
associated world-volume six-form is [9]

f6 = da5  c6  c4 f2  1

2 c2 f2 f2  1

6 c0 f2 f2 f2 ,

(4.1)

and, in addition to this tension form, only f2 appears in the action. as in previous
sections, this action can be generalised by introducing parameters into the denitions of
the background eld strengths. in analogy with the case of the d3-brane, we will only
introduce dual pairs of world-volume elds, i.e., elds that are related by auxiliary duality
relations. in other words, we are dualising the two-form eld strength f2 into the four-
form eld strength f4. in world-volume language this means that we are redening f6 as
f6  f6  y f2 f4. we let the background elds r1, r3 and r5 have the canonical form
r = dc  c h, whereas r7 is given by

r7 = dc6 + y dc4 b2  (1y) c4 h3 .

(4.2)

these eld strengths all obey bianchi identities of the form dr  r h = 0. the corre-
sponding world-volume elds are

to verify that f4 is an appropriate dual eld in the conventional sense one can apply
the methods of refs [20, 21] to the usual dbi d-brane action. one then obtains exactly

d3-brane case.

(4.11)

in the last line of the second relation we have extracted a linear combination of terms
that can be shown to vanish identically when both duality relations are satised (see
appendix c, in particular eq. (c.12)). hence, in applications of the d5-brane formulation
under discussion one may simply drop these terms and use the simplied expression.

as expected, we recover the usual d5-brane action for y = 0. in the opposite limit, y =
1, we get a dual (but equivalent) description. however, f2 does not decouple completely
from the action in this limit; unlike the situation for the d3-brane, in addition to the
implicit dependence, f2 also appears explicitly in the action. in order to fully eliminate
f2 one needs to solve an algebraic equation similar to the one encountered in ref. [21]. the
dierence compared to earlier approaches is that we have the additional information of
knowing the equations of motion and the action of the dual theory, so we can in principle
determine the dynamics of the three-form potential. another interesting limit appears to
be y = 1
3, where the action becomes quartic. one would like to relate the action for the
d5-brane given above to an action for the ns5-brane; we will return to this issue once we
have constructed an action for the ns5-brane which we will do next.

the type iib ns 5-brane

it has been known for several years [17] that the world-volume eld theory is described
(on-shell) by a six-dimensional vector multiplet. however, there has been a debate in

15

the literature about whether the action should be formulated in terms of a two-form
eld strength (as for the d5-brane) or in terms of a four-form eld strength (in keeping
with the prescription of accompanying a target-space s-duality transformation with a
world-volume poincare duality transformation); for discussions see e.g. refs [31, 32]. it is
furthermore known that the d5-, d3- and d1-branes can end on the ns5-brane; see e.g.
ref. [25]. from this perspective one expects a six-form, a four-form and a two-form to be
present in the world-volume theory of the ns5-brane. the six-form is dierent from the
one describing the tension and the need for it has been discussed in ref. [33]. below we
will construct an action whose world-volume eld content reects the above mentioned
facts.

first we need to choose a proper parameterisation of the background eld strengths.
since it is known that the fundamental string cannot end on the ns5-brane, we use
as a guiding principle the condition that f2 should not appear (not even implicitly) in
the world-volume action. this restriction leads to the following expressions for the rr
background eld strengths:

r1 = dc0 ,
r3 = dc2 + b2 dc0 ,
r5 = dc4 + b2 dc2 + 1
r7 = dc6 + b2 dc4 + 1

2 b2 b2 dc0 ,
2 b2 b2 dc2 + 1
the corresponding world-volume eld strengths become10

6 b2 b2 b2 dc0 .

(4.12)

f0 = da1  c0 ,
f2 = d a1  c2 + f0 b2 ,
f4 = da3  c4 + b2 f2  1
f6 = da5  c6 + b2 f4  1

2 b2 b2 f0 ,
2 b2 b2 f2 + 1

(4.13)
these relations can be succinctly written as r = eb dc and ebf = da  c, where the
last denition is iterative and f = f0 + f2 + f4 + f6. in the same compact notation the
bianchi identities are

6 b2 b2 b2 f0 .

the gauge-invariant eld strength of the ns-ns six-form gauge potential is chosen as

df = r + h3 f .

(4.14)

h7 = db6  (1y) c6 dc0 + y c0 dc6  (1x) c2 dc4 + x c4 dc2 ,
dh7 = r7 r1  r5 r3 .

(4.15)

the associated tension form is then found to be
f6 = d a5  b6  (1y) c6 f0 + y c0 f6  (1x) c2 f4 + x c4 f2 + (1xy) b2 f0 f4

(4.17)

the fact that one has a non-dynamical six-form in addition to the tension form makes
the situation analogous to the d-string discussion, where two eld strengths of maximal
degree are present together with a non-dynamical scalar f0.

given the above eld content, the ansatz for the action takes the by now familiar

form11

s =z h1 + (f0, f2, f4, f6) + f6  f6i .

(4.18)

compatibility between the equations of motion and the bianchi identities leads to the
following expressions for the duality relations:

2y  f6 f0 = k6 :=
2(1x)  f6 f2 = k4 :=

although this expression looks rather intimidating, it simplies somewhat in certain limits
of parameter space. the duality relations supplementing the action are readily obtained by
inserting the appropriate functional derivatives of this expression in the equations (4.19);
equivalent expressions are listed in appendix c. we would like to point out that one has
the freedom of adding to the action expressions whose variations vanish as a consequence of
the duality constraints, e.g. quadratic combinations of the constraints given in eq. (c.18).
finally, let us comment on the relation of our formulation of the ns5-brane to the
one obtained in ref. [18], and to the formulation of the d5-brane above. by inspection
of (4.23) one notices that there is no way to consistently eliminate the four-form eld
strength at the level of the action. in ref. [18], t-duality considerations led to an action
for the ns5-brane which is related to the d5-brane by a simple s-duality transformation of
the supergravity background, without the need for any poincare-duality transformations
in the world-volume. however, as for the dual d3-brane action of refs [20, 21], the world-
volume eld strength of ref. [18] does not satisfy a bianchi identity, nor is it invariant under
c0  c0 + 1; this is the primary source for the discrepancy. however, if both actions are
to describe the same object, it must be possible to obtain the results of ref. [18] from ours
at the level of the equations of motion. in order to accomplish this one must eliminate
f4 and f6 from the equation of motion for a1. as a rst step in this direction one has to
choose x = 1 and y = 0. it turns out to be rather involved to algebraically eliminate f4;
we therefore temporarily limit our considerations to backgrounds for which c0 = 0, and
also set  = 0 so that f0 = 0. under these simplifying assumptions we nd agreement
with the results of ref. [18]. it would be of interest to investigate whether this is still the
case when c0 6= 0. furthermore, implementing the restriction f0 = 0 into the expression
for  leads to complete agreement with the action for the d5-brane in eq. (4.10), provided

18

we let x  1  y, f2  f2, f ns
and f6  f6. these transformations follow from
making an sl(2,z) transformation of the background; under sl(2,z) the combinations
(b2, c2), (a1, a1), (b6, c6) and ( a5, a5) transform as doublets whereas c4 and a3 are
singlets. in particular, for the sl(2,z) transformation

4  f d5

4

s =(cid:18) 0 1
1 0(cid:19) ,

(4.24)

the eld strengths have the required transformation properties. reinstating the dilaton
factors one nds that these also transform correctly under the transformation e  e
associated with (4.24).

5 discussion

we would like to comment briey on some of the cases we have not treated in this paper.
for the d4-brane in the type iia theory, the relevant world-volume eld strengths are f2
and f3; since there is no possible dual to f1 we choose the parameters so that it does not
appear. the tension form is given by

f5 = da4  c5 + x b2 f3  (1x) c3 f2 + x c1 b2 f2 + (x 1

2) c1 f2 f2 ,

(5.1)

and satises the bianchi identity, df5 = r6 x h3 f3 (1x) r4 f2 + (x 1
2) r2 f2 f2 = 0.
the duality relations take the same canonical form as for the other d-branes. for x = 0
we recover the usual d4-brane description in terms of f2 = da1  b2, whereas for x = 1
we obtain a dual description in terms of f3 = da2  c3  c1 f2. in the dual case the
action can be related to the one given in ref. [21], by completely eliminating f2 at the
expense of losing manifest gauge invariance. for the symmetric choice x = 1
2, we obtain
an action which can also be obtained from the m5-brane action given in ref. [15] by double
dimensional reduction. for the type iia ns5-brane the relevant world-volume elds are
f1, f3 and f5, while f2 cannot have a dual and is thus not introduced; this meshes
nicely with the fact that the fundamental string cannot end on the ns5-brane. the eld
strength f3 is self-dual, whereas there is a parameter controlling the dualisation f1  f5.
in particular, for a certain choice of the parameter the action can be related to the direct
dimensional reduction of the action in ref. [15]. by applying the methods developed in
this paper to the d6-brane, it may be possible, for certain values of the parameters, to
lift the solution to eleven dimensions. since it is known that the d6-brane is obtained
from the d=11 kaluzaklein monopole, one would in this way obtain an action for the
latter object. the known action [35] for the kk-monopoles gives the standard d6-brane
action upon direct dimensional reduction. if it is possible to lift the d6-brane action for
other choices of the parameters one would presumably obtain other formulations of the
action for the kk-monopole in d = 11. a similar situation holds for the iia d8-brane,
where, for certain values of the parameters, it may be possible to lift the solution to eleven
dimensions and make contact with work on the m9-brane [36]. in order to treat the last

19

two cases it may be necessary to introduce more general parameters than those considered
in this paper. it would also be of interest to extend the formalism to include the d = 10
kk monopoles. another issue involves the extension to massive branes [37]. we have
seen that there is a correspondence between the possible brane-ending-on-another-brane
congurations and the restriction to only introducing world-volume elds which have
duals. invoking this restriction there seems to be a world-volume eld for every possible
brane-ending-on-another-brane case. conversely, every world-volume eld (except for
the tension form) can arise from the end of a brane. in addition, one also have the
congurations which arise from dualisations of the background. for the type iib branes
an interesting outstanding problem concerns the construction of a manifestly sl(2,z)-
covariant action for the type iib (p, q) ve-branes. however, the problem of constructing
such an action turns out to be signicantly more involved than the cases treated in this
section; nevertheless some progress can be made [34].

there exist formulations of the ten-dimensional n = 2 supergravity theories where all
the usual scalar elds (including the dilaton) are doubled, i.e., supplemented with their
poincare duals; see e.g. refs [38, 39]. in particular, the dilaton is supplemented by a nine-
form eld strength. for every allowed eld in the doubled formulations there appears to
be an associated brane. the question therefore arises if there exist branes which couple
to the dual of the dilaton (ns 7-branes).
in hulls general brane scan [32], which
is based on considerations of the supersymmetry algebra of the background superspace,
there appears to be no place for such objects. however, in the type iib theory the d7-
brane has to transform under sl(2,z), since the potential to which it couples does. in
particular, it is possible to transform it into a brane which couples to the dual of the
dilaton. it is furthermore known [40] that in a manifestly sl(2,z)-covariant formulation
there must appear a triplet of seven-branes coupling to the dual eight-form potentials of
the three scalars which belong to the sl(2,r)/u(1) coset. after gauge xing there remain
two scalars and two dual eight-form potentials. the branes coupling to these eight-form
potentials are the usual d7-brane and an ns7-brane.
in the type iia theory, on the
other hand, there is only one eight-form potential, which in this case should couple to an
ns7-brane. to our knowledge such an object has not been discussed in the literature. in
treating this case our method should prove to be especially useful since nothing is known
about the action.

it also would be desirable to have a more uniform description for the various branes
within the framework of this paper, along the lines of those available for the d-branes both
in their original formulation [36] and in the one with dynamically generated tension [9].
it should also be possible to construct t-duality rules which relate actions of the general
form considered in this paper. presumably it is possible to choose the parameters so that
they are left inert under t-dualisation, as suggested by the similarity between the d1- and
d2-brane actions presented earlier. a more thorough investigation of the correspondence
between the bianchi identity for fp+1 and p+ which seems to hold in all cases, might lead
to a deeper understanding of -symmetry. our actions should also nd applications in
the study of world-volume solitons [4143].

b the d = 10 type ii supergravities in superspace

the maximally supersymmetric supergravity theories in ten dimensions were originally
formulated in superspace language in refs [44] and [45] for type iib and type iia, respec-
tively. however, when dealing with higher-dimensional p-branes (p  4) it is necessary
to use formulations in which the poincare duals to all eld strengths contained in the re-
spective bosonic sectors are included on an equal footing. since the constraints imposed
on the superelds force the theories on-shell, this is indeed possible to do. in fact, one can
go even further and consider doubled formulations, in which every bosonic super-eld
except for the vielbein (but including the dilaton) is accompanied by its poincare-dual
eld (see e.g. [38, 39]).

in its doubled formulation the type iia theory comprises in its bosonic sector a viel-
a, a dilaton  and the gauge potentials b2, b6, b8 as well as c2k+1 (k = 0, . . . , 4).
bein em
(in the massive theory one also has zero- and ten-form eld strengths.) in the superspace
formulation each of the above elds (as well as the corresponding eld strengths) becomes
the leading component of a supereld. in the type iib theory we again have vielbein and
dilaton superelds and the potentials are b2, b6 and b8 and c2k, where k = 0, . . . , 4. the
type iib theory is chiral and has an so(2) r-symmetry group (u(1) in a complex formu-
lation) under which the two majoranaweyl spinorial superspace coordinates transform
as a doublet.

22

we work with real majorana spinors. the -matrices acting on the spinor space are
a  {1l, 11} (type iia) and a  {1l, i, j, k} (type iib), where a = (a)
 are real;
11 = 01    9 and squares to 1l; the 22 matrices i, j and k anticommute pairwise
and satisfy i 2 = 1l, j 2 = 1l, k 2 = 1l, ij = k, ki = j and jk = i. (notice in
particular the minus-sign in the last relation.) the matrices (a1...an) are antisymmetric
for n = 0, 3, 4, 7, 8 and symmetric for n = 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, while (11) is antisymmetric.
furthermore, the 22 matrix i is antisymmetric, whereas j and k are symmetric.
spinor indices are raised and lowered with the antisymmetric charge conjugation ma-

trix c and its inverse c , according to the rules  = c and m
additional useful information regarding the conventions we use can be found in ref. [4].
in the type iib theory, the two physical scalars,  and c0, belong to the coset space
sl(2,r)/u(1). however, the scalar elds can be made to transform linearly under sl(2,r)
by combining  and c0 into an sl(2,r) matrix u r on which sl(2,r) acts from the left and
2rsu s u r = 1. by a suitable xing of the
u(1) acts locally from the right. the u rs satisfy i
u(1) gauge symmetry one can remove the additional scalar eld that has been introduced
in the process and regain the physical scalars. for further details on this construction,
see ref. [44].

c -symmetry calculations

in this appendix we exemplify the calculations performed to verify -invariance of the
actions presented in the main part of the paper. the methods are similar for all cases,
with increasing complexity as the number of elds and brane dimensions increase. for

13here we list only the components that enter into our calculations. we use the conventions of ref. [4],
where a more complete table of constraints can be found (the expression for ha1...a5 given above corrects
a sign in ref. [4]). finally, t and  denote the torsion and dilatino superelds, respectively.

23

each case, we also list some identities which follow from the duality relations. these
identities are crucial for proving -invariance and should also be useful in applications of
our results. before delving into the specic cases considered, however, we rst describe
some general features of the calculations.

after inserting a suitably chosen ansatz for  = p+ into the -variation of the
constraint  = 1 + ({fi})  (fp+1)2  0, and utilising the formula (a.9), the variation
takes the generic form

p+ =xq,k (cid:2) m i1...ik

(c.1)

here {eq} = {1l, 11} (type iia) or {eq} = {1l, i, j, k} (type iib). since the i1...ims are all
linearly independent (for generic embeddings), each component has to vanish separately,
i.e.

m [i1...ik]

q

= 0 (dim 1/2) , n i[i2...ik]

q

= 0 (dim 0) .

(c.2)

the so(1,p) tensors n i[i2...ik]
at dimension 0 can be further decomposed into irreducible
parts, each of which has to vanish separately. we will now give some additional details
case by case.

we will now outline some of the main steps of how to arrive at this result. the projection
operator which makes the corresponding -variations vanish is14

2 f3 p = f31l h  (1x) f1211 + xf2111i

(c.4)

let us rst consider the condition m i
1l = 0, which reads (3x) f ik fk = (3x) f ik fk =
0. there are two ways this expression can vanish: either x = 3 or f ik fk = 0. it turns out
that the latter is the case. next we consider the requirement m [ij]
11 = 0. this condition
becomes

1 (cid:3) = 0 .

14in general it is advantageous to make an ansatz for p+ with arbitrary coecients which are then
determined by the calculation. to make the presentation more readable we will from the outset use the
correct coecients.

reduces to the rst of the duality relations given in (c.3). by similarly analysing the
condition m i
11 = 0, one obtains the second duality relation. for consistency one then has
to show that f ik fk = 0 follows from the duality relations. this is indeed the case, as can
be seen by taking the wedge product of the second duality relation in (c.3) with f1. to
complete the programme one must analyse the remaining components at dimensions 1/2
and 0 and show that they vanish using the information obtained so far; one also has to
show that p 2

+ = p+. we will, however, not give the details here.

furthermore, modulo this identity, one obtains the rst duality relation from the require-

to follow from the duality relations. as a further example we consider the implications of
the condition n ij
1l = 0. by multiplying the expression for the variation with the projection
operator one obtains the expression

j = 0. similarly from the m [ij]

next, we note that it follows from the duality relations that x k2f2 + (1x) k2 f2 = 0,
which implies f2f2 + f2 f2  ((f2 f2))2  ((f2f2))2 = 0. adding  1

the principal dierence between the three-brane and the ve-brane as far as establishing
-symmetry is concerned, is the increased level of complexity in the latter case; otherwise,
the basic steps of the computations are essentially the same and we will therefore try to
focus on the main diculties.

first, the condition that p+ (given in (4.9)) have the properties required of a half-
maximal rank projection operator gives three independent constraints which must be
fullled once the duality relations have been applied; in addition to an implicit expression
for  (similar in structure to the trace-part of the expression given in eq. (c.10)), these
j] = 0 (i.e., f2 and f4 must commute when considered as
are the condition f [i|k| (f4)k
matrices) and the identity

f2 f2  f4f4  1

3 (f2 f2  f2)f2 = 0 .

(c.12)

when turning to the analysis of the conditions for -invariance, it is very useful to assume
the last two properties from the outset and at the end show that they follow from the
action and the duality relations that are derived in the process.

indeed, all the information needed to determine the action and the duality relations is
contained in the requirement that p+  0. at dimension 1/2 this gives 16 constraint

26

equations8 scalar equations from the - and 1l-components plus 8 two-form equations
from the 2 and 4 ones. at dimension 0, each 1-, 3- and 5-component can be de-
composed into three so(1,5)-irreducible tensors which must vanish independently. for 1
and 5 these can be written as the antisymmetric, the traceless symmetric and the trace
part of a second-rank tensor. similarly, the 3-components give rank-four tensors with
the symmetries n [ijkl], n g(i[j)kl] and gi[j nm
kl]m, wheredenotes the traceless part.15 hence,
demanding that (p+)(0)  0 gives in total 343=36 separate constraint equations,
to add to the 16 coming from the corresponding requirement at dimension 1/2. while
some of these 52 constraint equations are more or less trivially satised, most require
some eort to be shown to hold; they can roughly be divided into six separate categories:
trivial ones; those that vanish for purely algebraic reasons; those proportional to [f2,f4]
or the identity (c.12); those that give expressions for the duality relations for f2 or f4;
and those that give expressions for . (not all of the constraints are, however, quite as
clear-cut, but rather combinations of the above listed categories.)

to illustrate the kind of reasoning involved in the analysis, let us consider the dimension-

equipped with expressions for the duality relations one can make use of the fact that
these relations involve the derivatives of the scalar functional  in order to determine the
action. when doing this, one has to take into account the further fact that the expressions
derived from the component analysis are valid only modulo the identity (c.12). the
condition that the duality relations both should give the same  upon integration xes
the expressions and the end result is the one displayed in (4.10).

once the action and the duality relations have been determined, it remains to show
that the latter imply the property that f2 and f4 commute as well as the identity (c.12).
the rst property is readily proven by taking the commutator of the hodge-dual of the
rst duality relation in eq. (4.11) with f4 and subtracting 12y
1y times the commutator of
the second one with f2. then, by using the last of the identities in (c.17) below, one is
left with an expression proportional to [f4, f2], which consequently vanishes. note that
one must use the proper duality relations for this calculation (i.e., the full expressions
given in eq. (4.11)) in order to be allowed to use the result that [f2,f4] = 0 when
proving the identity (c.12). we will now turn to this problem. we start by subtracting
the exterior product between f4 and the second duality relation in eq. (4.11) from the
exterior product between f2 and the hodge-dual of the rst one. one can then show that
one is left with an expression which implies the identity (c.12). in establishing this result
the following algebraic identity (valid when [f4, f2] = 0) is useful:

(f2 f4)f2f4 + 1
 1

4(f2 f2)(f4f4) = 0 .

2((f2 f2)f4)f4 + 1

2((f4f4) f2) f2

(c.16)

in addition to the identity (c.12), a number of purely algebraic identities enter in
the process of establishing -symmetry. below we list a selection of the most frequently
occurring ones (here a and b denote arbitrary antisymmetric second-rank tensors; note
that these identities are equally useful in the analysis of the ns5-brane case):

maj]m = 0 .

((a a) b)[i

(c.17)

when deriving identities of this kind it is convenient to use the freedom of choice of basis
to minimise the number of non-vanishing tensor components. also, for the more involved
identities, the assistance of computer algebra packages can be useful.

ns5

the -symmetry analysis for the ns5-brane is in many respects similar to the d5-brane
analysis sketched above. of course, the fact that there are now four instead of two world-
volume eld strengths does make the analysis rather more involved and lengthy.

28

one quickly nds that the matrices f2 and f4 must commute when the duality rela-
tions are satised. moreover, combining the condition from the dimension- 1
2 component
4 with that from the totally antisymmetric part of 4 at dimension 0, leads to the two
identities

0 = f0 f4  f6  f2 + 1
0 = f0 f4  f6  f2  1

2 (f0 f4  1

f2 f2 ,
f2 f2)(f0 f4  1

f2 f2) .

(c.18)

expressions for the duality relations, all valid modulo these identities, are obtained
from various component constraints. in particular, the components 6 j, 4 i, 2 j and i
give

 f6 f0 = f6 + 1
 f6 f2 = f4  (f0)2 f4 + 1
+x( f2 f4) f2 + 1

6 ( f2 f2 f2) + (1y) (f0)2 f6  x f0 ( f2 f4) ,

2 f0 ( f2 f2) + (y2)f6 f0 f2
2 [f4( f2 f2)]  f0 (f4f4) ,

 f6 f4 =  f2  y f6 f0 f4 + (1x) ( f2 f4) f4  f0 f2f4

(c.19)

similar expressions for each of the above duality relations are obtained twice at di-
mension 0.
in addition, for other components one obtains a mixture of the duality
relations as well as various identities following from them, which are somewhat intri-
cate to disentangle. by inserting the above expressions in trivial identities of the kind
0  ( f6 f0) f4  f0 ( f6 f4), one nds the following identities which also enter in the
-symmetry computations:

0 = f6 f4  f0  f2  f0 ( f2 f4) f4 + f0 f6 [f0 f4  1

f2 f2 (f4 f4)

(c.20)

the correct expression for  is derived by integrating the expressions for its func-
tional derivatives obtained from the four duality relations (c.19) via the equations (4.19).
again, before integrating one must take care to incorporate the freedom allowed for in
the expressions (c.19) as a consequence of the identities (c.18). most of this freedom is
xed by mutual consistency requirements and one is left with the expression for  given
in eq. (4.23). having obtained an expression for  in this way, one must show that the
identities used to arrive at the result follow from the duality relations. in particular, one

29

must derive the condition that f2 and f4 commute, and in addition the identities (c.18).
in proving the rst statement it is convenient to consider [k4,f4] + [ f2, k2] and use
the algebraic identity

f [i|m|( f2f4)m

j]  1

2( f2 f2)[i|m|fm

j] = 0 .

(c.21)

finally, the derivation of (c.18) is performed by considering the trivially satised relations

0 = y f0 k4 + (1x) k6 f2 ,
0 = 1

(1y) k0 f4 + 1

(1x) f6 k2 + 1

(c.22)

for which the expressions on the right-hand-side can be shown to be linear in the identi-
ties (c.18).
