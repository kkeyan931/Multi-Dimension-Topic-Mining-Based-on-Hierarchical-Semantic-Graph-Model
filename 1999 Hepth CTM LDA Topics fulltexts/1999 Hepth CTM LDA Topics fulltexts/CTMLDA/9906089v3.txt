abstract

we show that the requirements of renormalizability and physical
consistency imposed on perturbative interactions of massive vector
mesons x the theory essentially uniquely. in particular physical con-
sistency demands the presence of at least one additional physical de-
gree of freedom which was not part of the originally required physical
particle content. in its simplest realization (probably the only one)
these are scalar elds as envisaged by higgs but in the present for-
mulation without the symmetry-breaking higgs condensate. the
nal result agrees precisely with the usual quantization of a classical
gauge theory by means of the higgs mechanism. but the empha-
sis is shifted: instead of invoking the gauge principle (and the higgs

mechanism) on the local quantum eld theory, the principles of local
quantum physics restricted by the perturbative renormalizability de-
mand explains (via bohrs correspondence) the classical gauge prin-
ciple as a selection principle among the many a priori (semi)classical
possibilities of coupling vector elds among each other. our method
proves an old conjecture of cornwall, levin and tiktopoulos stating
that the renormalization and consistency requirements of spin=1 par-
ticles lead to the gauge theory structure (i.e. a kind of inverse of t
hoofts famous renormalizability proof in quantized gauge theories)
which was based on the on-shell unitarity of the s-matrix. since all
known methods of renormalized perturbation theory are o-shell, our
proof is dierent and a bit more involved than the original arguments.
we also speculate on a possible future ghostfree formulation which
avoids eld coordinates altogether and is expected to reconcile the
on-shell s-matrix point of view with the o-shell eld theory structure.

1 introduction

in the development of understanding of the renormalization aspects for spin=1
interactions, the classical concepts of gauge and bre bundles have played a
crucial role. without the closely related higgs mechanism it would be hard
to imagine, how in the stage of qft at the end of the 60ies, the incorpo-
ration of the electro-weak interaction into the framework of renormalizable
eld theory could have been achieved.

the main motivation for the present article starts from the remark that
to our knowledge the higgs mechanism via higgs condensates within the set-
ting of gauge theories has not a well-understood intrinsic quantum physical
content. hence we choose an alternative procedure by which we will con-
struct the same physical results for interacting massive vector mesons in a
quite dierent way which does not rely on the above concepts. in our ap-
proach based on the well-known real-time causal formulation of perturbative
qft, the renormalizability in the presence of selnteracting vector mesons
is the basic input requirement and the uniqueness and the gauge appear-
ance of the polynomial interaction densities are consequences. with other
words we would phrase t hoofts famous statement that gauge structure
implies renormalizability the other way around: maintaining perturbative
renormalizability in the presence of vector mesons explains the gauge struc-
ture. since local quantum theory is more fundamental than classical, this

2

brings interacting vector mesons into harmony with the properly understood
bohrs correspondence principle:
it is the quantum theory which tells the
classical which possibility among many couplings involving vector elds and
lower spin elds it has to follow, namely the gauge invariant one.

we would not have gained much, and a cynic might claim that we have
replaced one mystery (the gauge recipe) by another one (the renormalization
prescription), but fortunately, we have some slightly more tangible results
to oer. our method brings into the open the long looming suspicion that
the appearance of additional physical degrees of freedom (the alias higgs
particle but now without vacuum condensates) is a necessity, following from
perturbative consistency up to second order (no claim outside of perturba-
tion theory is made!)1. in addition it suggests strongly that the physics of
zero mass theory should be approached from massive vector mesons, the lat-
ter being conceptually (but not necessarily analytically) simpler. so as it
happens often in physics, the new aspect does not so much lie in the physical
results as such, but rather in the novel way in which they are obtained and
in the interpretation associated with this derivation.

to avoid misunderstandings we emphasize that our approach supports the
principle of local gauge invariance because we obtain the same results (lie-
algebraic structure, necessity of the scalar higgs eld) by starting from
quantum physical requirements instead of the conventional, semiclassical,
dierential geometric ideas. however it is also important to emphasize that
crucial theoretical observations have been made in the rst 5 years of exis-
tence of gauge theories (e.g. t hooft, veltmann [45], [44] and becchi, rouet,
stora [3]). after almost 25 years there seems to be a consensus (based on
the present theoretical aspects of the standard model) that gauge theory,
despite its impressive early successes, did not (yet) reach the level of ma-
turity of other great theoretical developments in this century. our present
attempt at the physics of vector mesons outside (but not in contradiction to)
gauge theory is very much motivated by this state of aairs. we consider this
attempt as something preliminary. although it starts from the very physi-
cal wigner particle concept, it shares with the gauge approach the necessity
of extension by unphysical degrees of freedom (ghosts), which in this case
originates from renormalizability. this can be formulated as a cohomologi-

1unfortunately this is not a structural theorem as e.g. the theorem connecting spon-
taneous symmetry-breaking with the appearance of goldstone modes or the theorem
connecting relating the appearance of massive photons with charge-screening; rather it
still remains in the setting of renormalized perturbation theory [43].

cal extension within the wigner one particle spaces. the advantage of the
present approach is that the auxiliary role of the ghosts as renormaliza-
tion catalyzers2 becomes more manifest. the reader nds some speculative
remarks on where to look for a ghostfree formulation in the last sections.

since some of our concepts are not new, it may be helpful to remind
the reader of some historical precedents. ever since theories in which vector
mesons or higher spin particles became physically relevant in the late 50ies,
there were two points of views to deal with such problem: either to start from
the wigner particle picture and stay close to particles and scattering theory,
or to quantize classical gauge eld theory (canonically or by functional in-
tegrals) and to make contact with (infra)particles at a later stage. in fact
sakurai, who introduced the term yang-mills theory [29], and who wanted
to use quantized classical eld theory for the description of massive vector
mesons in strong interactions, encountered diculties to reconcile the two
points of view. in most of his contributions he therefore took a phenomeno-
logical non-geometric point of view within a dispersion theoretical setting.
this was particularly advisable since, as a result of some criticism of pauli,
the use of the yang-mills model for the description of massive vector mesons
was cast into question.

the discovery of the electro-weak theory and the renormalization of yang-
mills theories [44] led to a drastic change of that picture. the rst approach,
which tried to make the gauge principle for vector mesons more palatable
from a particle physics point of view, found some protagonists in the early
days of gauge theories (lewellyn-smith [26], bell [4], cornwall et al. [8]). it
was argued that tree unitarity of the s-matrix implies that one can choose
the elds such that the model describes a spontaneously broken gauge theory.
cornwall, levin and tiktopoulos even gave a heuristic argument that renor-
malizability requires tree unitarity. on the other side the gauge or yang-mills
point of view enjoyed general popularity and became the predominant one,
irrespective of whether it could be derived from a more particle dominated
on-shell approach or not. here we show that the tree unitarity viewpoint

2the ghosts are objects outside local quantum physics which are neither present in the
original physical degrees of freedom (which one wants to couple) nor in the nal physical
cohomological subspace. but without their intermediate presence one does not know how
to set up the renormalization machinery. in the perturbative framework we shall need
fermionic and bosonic (scalar) ghost elds. the rst correspond to the faddeev-popov
ghosts, the latter to the higgs ghosts (which are also called would be goldstone
bosons) or stuckelberg elds.

may be substituted by renormalizability within a suitable cohomologically
extended wigner particle setting. the presence of additional physical de-
grees of freedom (higgs particles) follows from perturbative consistency, even
though there is no concept of gauge symmetry breaking.

the main reason in favor of the gauge point of view was not only its
success in describing problems of quantum matter coupled to external elec-
tromagnetic elds as well as its aesthetical mathematical appeal, but rather
that it opened a path to a renormalizable theory of massive vector mesons,
as it was demonstrated by t hooft and veltman [45] [44]. this created, at
least for some physicists, the impression that in addition to causality and
spectral properties the general framework of qft needs an additional prin-
ciple for interacting massive vector mesons, namely the gauge principle. here
we propose a more intrinsic alternative framework which produces the same
physical (gauge invariant) results solely on the principles of local quantum
physics (lqp, for an introduction and overview see [21]) and perturbative
renormalizability. it uses a simplied free form of the brs formalism [3] for a
cohomological extension of the wigner representation theory as a mathemat-
ically less formal operator substitute for the faddeev-popov formalism [19]
in functional representations. this special cohomological extension (which is
only available for massive vector mesons!) lowers the operator dimension of
free massive vector elds from their physical value 2 to the formal (classical)
value 1 without loosing their point-like nature. such a lowering is motivated
by renormalizability within the framework of causal perturbation and the
resulting theory is for all practical purposes equivalent to the gauge invari-
ant lagrangian approach3. our contention is that the renormalizability of
interacting massive vector mesons alone uniquely xes the theory, including
its additional higgs-like matter content. in other words the gauge and higgs
aspect from which one starts the lagrangian quantization in the standard
formulation is reduced to the concept of renormalizability with which we
feel more comfortable because it occurs on the more fundamental level of
local quantum physics where there is still a future chance for a profound
understanding. the remaining intrinsic feature of the higgs mechanism is
the schwinger charge screening4 caused by the higgs-like matter degrees of

3although most of the free elds which correspond to the (m,s) wigner representation
cannot be obtained in the setting of free lagrangians l0, one can always rewrite a causal
interaction w in terms of lagrangian eld coordinatizations. this is necessary for path
integral formulations, but not for the causal formulation of perturbations.

in more recent times a similar point of view has been taken up by aste,
scharf and one of the authors (m.d.) [2]. we show however that their free
perturbative operator gauge invariance, which is a pure quantum formula-
tion of gauge invariance, is not needed as an a priori perturbative requirement
for pure massive theories: our physical consistency is a weaker requirement
but xes the theory to the same extent. some aspects of our point of view
appeared in the work of grigore [20]. it also has been mentioned in the set-
ting of schwingers work and of general quantum eld theory by one of the
authors (b. s) [33].

recently there has been an approach to understand the local observ-
able -algebras of nonabelian gauge theories without addressing the particle
content (which in the lqp framework is anyhow part of the separate more
dicult representation theory associated with states on the algebra) [10].
this approach was specially aimed at the zero mass theories with infrared
problems, because the method does not require the existence of an adiabatic
limit. in that case one cannot use the scattering theory of the physical par-
ticles and the brs operators cannot be written as bilinear operators in free
elds but they receive interacting contributions in every order. therefore one
has to face the more dicult problem of a changing position of the physical
cohomology space inside the extended space depending on the perturbative
order. the zero mass limit in our approach is conceptually and analytically
complicated because it is expected to lead to charge liberation (the opposite
of the schwinger-swieca charge screening) and the decoupling of the physical
consistency (higgs) degree of freedom. those physical matter elds which
will be charged in that limit cannot maintain their point-like localization,
rather one expects that their localization cannot be better than semi in-
nite space-like (mandelstam string-like). in fact the tight relation between
these various phenomena generates the hope that by controlling those o-
shell infrared problems one may actually get an insight into this (even in

[38] thought about a massive phase in qed through the mechanism of charge screening
but without (higgs) vacuum condensates. in order to make his non-perturbative ideas of
massive vector mesons (the maxwellian interaction is renormalizable) more palatable, he
invented the 2-dim. schwinger model. (in fact in the lowenstein-swieca treatment of this
model there is a chiral condensate (coming from the -degeneracy), but after the dust has
settled, the physical content is described in terms of a massive free eld only). schwingers
ideas were later elevated by swieca into a theorem about vector mass generation via charge
screening [43].

perturbation theory) notoriously dicult localization structure.

for reasons of brevity we exemplify our procedure in a particular class,
namely selnteracting models of massive vector mesons. in section 2 we re-
view the causal approach for massive vector mesons and its simplication as a
result of the existence of a natural fock reference space supplied by scattering
theory. our presentation uses a simplied quadratic brs formalism. phys-
ical consistency means that the s-matrix constructed on fock space (which
is the extended space, i.e.
it includes ghost states) induces a well dened
(unitary) operator on the physical subspace.

as a justication for the introduction of ghost elds we then describe
in section 3 the apparent clash between renormalizability and the operator
dimension dima = 2 of the free vector meson operators in the usual causal
setting and its resolution via cohomological ghost extension, which can be
preempted on the level of the wigner one-particle spaces.

in the fourth section we formulate physical consistency in an alternative
way which does not rely on scattering theory. the existence of the lowest
dimensional interpolating physical (i.e. brs-invariant) elds (the ones which
we want to describe in our model as observable particles) does not only x the
form of these elds, but it also determines the interaction density (including
the necessity of the alias higgs particle) in agreement with sect. 2.
in
particular we nd that the physical interpolating elds are composites in the
elementary elds of the extended theory.

so the lsz-type power series in terms of the physical incoming fock space
operators are modied (as we comment in sect. 5). this leads to a loss of
the specic iterative law for the perturbative representation of the coecient
functions in terms of retarded products (for the elds). only the general
lsz-like identication of coecient functions of local elds involving multi-
ple commutators of the local eld with the incoming free eld (generalized
formfactors) remains valid [37]. the reason for this complication, which pre-
vents the interchange of computations with the descend to the physical elds,
is that the wick-basis used for writing the latter in terms of linear combina-
tions of composites (including ghosts) is not a natural basis for the physical
elds (i.e. the elds which commute with the brs charge q).

section 5 also contains some still speculative remarks of where one has
to look for, if one wants to have a ghostfree formulation. in view of the fact
that the previous sections have made clear that ghosts behave in some sense

7

analogous to catalyzers5 in chemistry, this is not an academic problem but
really goes to the root of understanding of renormalizability for higher spin
where the standard causal approach breaks down. we are led to believe that
such an approach must bypass the bogoliubov-shirkov transition operator
s(g) and be on-shell i.e. directly deal with the on-shell s-matrix and multi
particle formfactors of physical elds.

we emphasize again that we consider the present formalism as transitory
towards a completely ghostfree formulation of interactions involving higher
spin particles. although it does not achieve this aim, it creates a critical
bohr-heisenberg attitude towards the many unobservable and formal aspects
of the standard gauge formalism.

2 consistent perturbative construction of the

s-matrix for massive vector elds

the aim of this section is to construct the stuckelberg-bogoliubov-shirkov
transition functional s(g), which is the generating functional for the time
ordered products of wick polynomials. as most functional quantities this
object is not directly observable but it gives rise to fundamental physical
observables as the s-matrix, formfactors and correlation functions of observ-
able elds. the notation should not be misread as the s-matrix by which we
always mean the scattering operator computed with the lsz or haag-ruelle
scattering theory. our model is that of selnteracting massive vector mesons.
our procedure is related to the one of scharf, aste and the rst author [2],
[30], but similarly to a previous discussion by the other author [34] and to
grigore [20] as well as older articles as lewellyn-smith [26], we simply rely
on physical consistency within the framework of local quantum physics and
do not require such technical tools as operator gauge invariance although
they tend to simplify calculations.

using the stuckelberg-bogoliubov-shirkov-epstein-glaser method [5] [17]

5one introduces them in order to lower the operator dimension of the interaction density
w to the renormalizable value four. this is achieved by decreasing the dimension of the
vector potential from two to one as a result of an unphysical cohomological extension of the
wigner one-particle representation theory. after the calculations have been done in the
extended setting, one eliminates the ghosts by cohomological descend (brs-invariance).

(1)

gj  s(r4), which is a formal power series in g. the unknown tj1...jn are
operator valued distributions 6. they are constructed inductively by means
of the following requirements (strongly inuenced by the general wightman-
framework [42]):

(a) specication of the model in rst order : the rst order expressions
are the main input of the construction. they specify the model and must
[tj(x), tk(y)] = 0 for (x  y)2 < 0. we assume that t0(x) 
be local:
w0(x)  w (x) = w (x) is the physically relevant interaction density in
fock space (i.e. a poincare covariant scalar composite described by a wick
polynomial). tj  wj, j = 1, ..., g are auxiliary interactions. the in-
teraction wj is switched by the space-time dependent coupling constant
gj  s(r4). the physically relevant s-matrix is obtained in the adiabatic
limit: g0  const., gj  0, j = 1, ..., g.
(b) permutation symmetry: due to the ansatz (1) we may require per-
mutation symmetry

tj1...jn(x1, ..., xn) = tj1...jn(x1, ..., xn),

  sn.

(2)

(c) causality:

s(g(1) + g(2)) = s(g(1))s(g(2))

if

j supp g(1)

j  (j supp g(2)

j + v) = ,

(3)

where v denotes the closed backward/forward light cone. this requirement
is equivalent to (see the appendix of [16]) 7

tj1...jn(x1, ..., xn) = tj1...jl(x1, ..., xl)tjl+1...jn(xl+1, ..., xn)

(4)

6for questions concerning domains we refer to [17]. for all operators which appear
in sections 2 and 3 there exists a common dense invariant domain d and we restrict all
operators to this subspace.
7the non-trivial part of this equivalence is that in the n-th order expression of (3) only

special test functions appear, whereas (4) holds on s(r4n).

9

if

{x1, ..., xl}  ({xl+1, ..., xn} + v) = .

this means that tj1...jn(x1, ..., xn) is a (well-dened) time ordered product of
wj1(x1),
..., wjn(xn). hence we use the notation

tj1...jn(x1, ..., xn) = t (wj1(x1)...wjn(xn))

(5)

due to the induction with respect to the order n, the tj1...jn are uniquely xed
by causality up to the total diagonal n = {(x1, ..., xn)|x1 = x2 = ... = xn}.
the extension of the tj1...jn to the total diagonal is non-unique. it is restricted
by the following normalization conditions:

(d) poincare covariance;
(e) unitarity: s(g)1 = s(g) for g = (g0, 0, ..., 0), g0 real valued;
(f) scaling degree: the degree of the singularity at the diagonal, mea-
sured in terms of steinmann scaling degree [40][6]8, may not be increased by
the extension. this ensures renormalizability by power counting if the scaling
degree (or mass dimension) of all wj is  4. this degree is a tool which is
related to weinbergs power counting.
additional normalization conditions must be imposed, if one wants to
maintain further symmetries or relations 9, e.g. discrete symmetries (p,c,t),
operator gauge invariance (29-30) or the eld equations of the interacting
elds ((n4) in [10]), which can be obtained from the functional s(g) (1) by
bogoliubovs formula (see sect.4).

the existence of the adiabatic limit restricts the extension additionally:
for pure massive theories epstein and glaser [18] proved that, with correct
mass and wave function (re)normalization the adiabatic limit of the func-
tional s(g) exists in the strong operator sense and it is this limit which we
call s-matrix. more precisely setting g(x) := (g0(x), 0, ...0) the limit

sn  lim
0

sn(g)

(6)

8we adopt here the notion scaling degree to operator valued distributions by using
the strong operator topology. note that the scaling degree of a wick monomial agrees
with its mass dimension.

9we consider symmetries and relations which are satised away from the total diagonal,
due to the causal factorization (5) and the inductive assumption. poincare covariance (d)
and unitarity (e) are of this type.

10

exists   d, where g0  s(r4), g := g0(0) > 0 is the coupling constant
and sn(g) (sn resp.) denotes the n-th order of the functional s(g) (s-matrix
resp.). it follows that the s-matrix is unitary as an operator valued formal

power series in fock space [18]: s =pn sn, sn  gn, ss = 1 = ss on d.

due to this fact we solely consider models in which all elds are massive.
in order that it makes physically sense to consider the s-matrix, we assume
that there are no unstable physical particles as e.g. the w- and z-bosons in
the electroweak theory.

in vector meson theories (which are gauge theories) the crucial prob-
lem is the elimination of the unphysical degrees of freedom. in the s-matrix
framework this problem turns into the requirement that the s-matrix in-
duces a well-dened unitary operator on the space of physical states (this is
discussed in detail below). we will see that this condition is very restrictive:
it determines the possible interactions to a large extent.

let us rst consider the free incoming elds. we quantize the free vector

elds (a

(where m is the pauli-jordan distribution to the mass m), which corre-
sponds to the feynman gauge. the representation of this -algebra re-
quires an indenite inner product space. we, therefore, work in a krein
fock space f . we denote the scalar product by (., .) and a+ is the adjoint
of a w.r.t. (., .). let j be the krein operator: j 2 = 1, j + = j. then the
indenite inner product < ., . > is dened by

< a, b > (a, jb),

a, b  f

and  denotes the adjoint with respect to < ., . >:

let q be an (unbounded) -symmetrical nilpotent operator in f

q = q

by means of q2 = 0 one easily nds that d is the direct sum of three,
pairwise orthogonal (w.r.t. (., .)) subspaces [22][23]

and hphys is interpreted as the physical subspace of f . we denote the pro-

the rst denition (i.e. hphys) has the advantage that the set of physical
states is a subspace of the krein fock space f , which has a clear particle
interpretation. but hphys is not lorentz invariant (in contrast to hphys). the
change of its position inside the total space under lorentz-transformations
is of course a result of the lack of lorentz-invariance of j.

to describe free spin=1 elds the introduction of a brst-formalism (as
we just have done) is not necessary. however, our main topic is to describe
the interacting theory in the adiabatic limit. so the incoming and outgoing
elds are asymptotically free. hence, being equipped with a characterization
of the asymptotical physical states in terms of a brst-formalism for free
elds, our scattering point of view is much simplied.

let ss = 1 = ss (on d). we now discuss two dierent formulations
of the physical consistency of the s-matrix:
(i) a consistent s-matrix theory requires

p0sp0sp0 = p0 = p0sp0sp0  (s00) = (s00)1
(ii) in the framework of the denition (22) of the physical states consis-
tency means that s and s1 = s induce well-dened operators on the factor
space hphys by the denition

on hphys.

requiring a perturbative condition which implies [q, s] = 0, namely the

in references [2], [30] physical consistency of the s-matrix is satised by

free perturbative operator gauge invariance 10 (or q-divergence
condition): let w  t0 be the interaction lagrangian. then there exists
a wick polynomial w 

1 with

[q, w (x)] = i w

let us assume that (30) holds true to all orders  (n  1). due to the
causal factorization (4) the requirement (30) is then satised away from the
total diagonal, i.e. on s(r4n\n). hence, (30) is an additional normalization
10the reason for this name stems from the fact that q is the generator of the brst-
transformation of the free incoming elds. for the present purpose we will simply refer
to it as the q-divergence condition for time ordered products since it has nothing to do
with the classical notion of gauge invariance in the dierential geometric setting of bre
bundles, but secures that the true s-matrix is physical. roughly speaking it is the o
shell version of physicality of the on-shell s-matrix.

condition for t (w...w ) and t (w...w 
1 ...w ). but it is a highly non-trivial
task to prove that there exists an extension to the diagonal which satises
(30) and the other normalization conditions (d), (e) and (f).

in contrast to [q, s] = 0 or [q, s]|ker q = 0, the q-divergence condition
(29-30) makes sense also in models in which the adiabatic limit does not
exist, e.g. for massless selnteracting vector elds (nonabelian gauge theo-
ries). for massless su(n)-yang-mills theories it has been proved that the
q-divergence condition (29-30) (more precisely the corresponding c-number
identities which imply (29-30)) can be satised to all orders [12],[13], and that
these c-number identities imply the usual slavnov-taylor identities [14]. in
addition, (29-30) determines to a large extent the possible structure of the
model (see below). we emphasize that this is a pure quantum formulation
of gauge invariance, without reference to classical physics.

in the present case of pure massive vector mesons (or more generally in
gauge theories in which the strong adiabatic limit (6) of the transition
functional s(g) exists) we proceed in an alternative way. we do not require
the q-divergence condition (29-30) as a new physical principle, instead we
simply require physical consistency of the s-matrix, which means

[q, s]|ker q = 0

(31)

by lemma 1. this is a weaker condition than (29-30). but we will see that
it determines the theory to the same extent. our procedure is similar to
grigore [20].11

first we construct the operator q (10) which denes the physical states.
for massless vector meson theories the procedure is well-known [25], [11].
the nilpotency of q gives reason to introduce an anticommuting pair of ghost

11however, there are two conceptual shortcomings in these papers. it is overlooked that
most of the trilinear terms in w vanish in the adiabatic limit due to energy-momentum
conservation and, hence, to rst order the condition (31) yields no information about the
trilinear terms in w (see appendix a).

by using the terminology introduced below the second shortcoming can be described as
follows: the higgs eld(s) is/are treated as scalar partner(s) (with arbitrary mass mh  0)
of the massless vector eld(s), which does/do not appear in q and, hence, is/are physical.
by chance this works for the electroweak theory (there is one massless vector eld and one
higgs eld is needed). but e.g. in the present case of pure massive vector mesons, there
would be no higgs eld and such a model is physically inconsistent (31) to second order.
this insuciency does not appear in [2] and [30].

if we insert the massive aa and ua elds into the formula (32) for q the

(34)

to restore the nilpotency we proceed as follows [23]: to each vector eld aa
we consider a scalar eld a with the same mass ma

((cid:3) + m2

a)a = 0,

[a(x), b(y)] = iabma(x  y), a = a.

(35)

we call the elds a also ghost elds (bosonic ghosts) because they are
unphysical (see below). then, due to [a
b (y) + mbb] = 0,
the charge

a + maa,  a

is nilpotent and symmetrical. later we shall see that an additional scalar
eld h with arbitrary mass mh  0 is needed13

((cid:3) + m2

h)h = 0,

[h(x), h(y)] = imh (x  y), h = h.

(37)

12the convergence of this integral (and also of the corresponding expression (36) in the

massive theory) can be shown by using a method of requardt [28],[10].

13for simplicity we only consider models in which one additional scalar eld suces for

a consistent construction of the s-matrix.

17

the notation h is reminiscent of the higgs eld, but one with no vacuum
condensate (leaving aside the academic point of whether higgs idea would
allow for our terminology): < 0|h(x)|0 >= 0, where |0 > f is the vacuum
of the free elds. for the representation of aa (7), ua, ua (33), a (35) and
h (37) in a krein fock space f and especially the denition of j we refer to
[23]14. note that the ghost elds ua, ua (33) and a (35) are also asymptotic
elds, but that asymptotic states containing ghost exitations do not belong
to the physical hilbert space (14). from the commutation relations

[q, a

a] = iua,

[q, a] = imaua,

{q, ua} = 0,

{q, ua} = i(a

a + maa),

[q, h] = 0

(38)

we conclude that hphys (14) is the linear span of the set of states b1....bl|0 >
, l  n0, where b1, ...., bl are transversal vector meson elds (three polariza-
tions) or h-elds. using this explicit result the positivity assumption (13)
can be veried [23]. we emphasize that h is physical, in contrast to the
(scalar) bosonic ghost elds a.

the following requirements:

we are now looking for the possible interactions w  w0 which satisfy
(a) w is a wick polynomial in the free incoming elds. each monomial

in w has at least three factors,

(b) w is invariant with respect to poincare transformations,
(c) the number of u-elds agrees with the number of u-elds in each

monomial of w (i.e. the ghost number is zero),

for renormalizability by power counting),

(d) the scaling degree (or mass dimension) of w is  4 (this is necessary
(e) w = w  (which yields s = s1 if the time ordered products are

suitably normalized),

(f) physical consistency (31).
first we point out that the requirements (a)-(f) do not x the interaction
uniquely. even if we replace in (f) the physical consistency (31) by the q-
divergence condition (29-30), which is a stronger requirement, the following
non-uniqueness is known: considering solely the q-divergence condition to

14in [23] it was not realized that without the higgs eld h (or an ingenious substitute)
the q-divergence condition to second order is violated. we represent the h-eld similarly
to the other scalar elds a with j = 1 in the h-fock space.

where d

condition to orders n  2 (30) into account, it seems that this freedom
can be maintained, due to the following result.
it is shown in [15] that
the q-divergence condition (30) can be satised to all orders (by choosing
suitable normalizations) for any (, ), if the generalized (free perturbative
operator) gauge invariance 15 holds true for (, ) = (0, 0). moreover, under
this assumption, one can prove

p0t (w (,)(x1)...w (,)(xn))p0 = p0t (w (0,0)(x1)...w (0,0)(xn))p0 + divergences

(40)

(see [15], divergences means divergences of local operators) and hence the
physical s-matrix s00 is independent from (, ) (because the divergences
vanish in the adiabatic limit in pure massive theories).

now we make the most general ansatz for w (up to divergence and

missing in any nonabelian model. nevertheless we strongly presume that this statement
holds true for all models which are brst-invariant, especially for the model studied below
of three massive, selnteracting vector elds.

abc, dabc, eabc, habc, jabc, kab, lab, pab, qab, ra, s  r are arbitrary
constants (which are introduced without any knowledge about a gauge group).
one can show that physical consistency (31) requires that fabc is totally an-
tisymmetric (i.e.
this part of the result (45) below is independent of the
restriction to three vector elds which is made in the following). hence the
simplest non-trivial model of selnteracting massive (ma > 0a) vector elds
is that of three elds: a = 1, 2, 3 16. from now on we specialize to this case.
in particular a single massive spin 1 eld (corresponding to the u(1)-case)
cannot be selnteracting.

our aim is to determine the parameters in w (41) and the tree normal-
ization terms (see (49) below) by the consistency condition (31). the hope
is that one can conclude from

0 = [q, sn]|ker q =

in

n!z dx1...dxn [q, t (w (x1)...w (xn))]|ker q

(42)

that [q, t (w (x1)...w (xn))] must be a sum of divergences of local operators
and that then one can follow the calculations in [2].

but there is a diculty at rst order, which is explained in detail in
appendix a. the adiabatic limit of the trilinear terms in w vanishes (except
possibly the h-couplings) due to energy-momentum conservation. this is
just the fact that for stable particles there are no s-matrix elements with
three particle legs; the lowest tree contributions involve  4 legs. hence,
we get no information about these terms from [q, s1]|ker q = 0. for the
quadrilinear terms w (4) in w the procedure works (see also appendix a): we
obtain that [q, w (4)] must be the divergence of a wick polynomial. in [20]
it is shown that this implies w (4) = 0 except for a term : h 4 :. but the
16the resulting model is usually called su (2) higgs-kibble model. it is obtained from
the electroweak theory, which is studied in detail in [2], by setting the weinberg angle
w = 0 and omitting the photon eld, which decouples in this case.

20

latter term will be excluded by consistency (31) to second order. (the well-
known : h 4 :-coupling is of second order in g, it appears in the framework of
causal perturbation theory as a tree normalization term of t (w (x1)w (x2)),
see below.)

to determine the parameters in the trilinear terms w (3) of w (41) we
compute the tree diagrams in t (w (3)(x1)w (3)(x2)) (which depend on these
parameters) and require

z d4x1 d4x2 [q, t (w (3)(x1)w (3)(x2))|tree]|ker q = 0.
 for the terms with x1 6= x2 the t -product factorizes, e.g.

instead of the long explicit calculation we give a heuristic description:

x2 + v  we have

for x1 6

(43)

[q, t (w (3)(x1)w (3)(x2))|tree] = [q, w (3)(x1)]w (3)(x2)|tree + w (3)(x1)[q, w (3)(x2))]|tree.

(44)

this makes it plausible that the cancelation of these terms17 yields the same

and some relations for kab, lab, pab and qab ([2], [20] and [30]). there results
no restriction on s. one easily veries that these values of the parameters are
not only necessary for the cancelation of the terms x1 6= x2 in (43) and for
(29), they are also sucient. by absorbing a constant factor in g we obtain

fabc = abc.

(46)

becomes clear from the explicit expressions.

17the fact that the terms x1 6= x2 cannot be canceled by diagonal terms x1 = x2
18it is obvious that the q-divergence condition to rst order implies the cancelation of

the terms x1 6= x2 in (43), but here we proceed in the opposite direction.

21

the latter are the structure constants of su(2). so the gauge group structure
is not put in, it comes out as a consequence of physical consistency and the
ansatz (41) for w . for more complicated models (i.e. more than three
vector elds) this conclusion is impossible at this stage, because one does
not know that the fabcs satisfy the jacobi identity. but then the latter is
obtained in the next step (see below). so far it is possible that all couplings
involving the h-eld vanish, i.e. the higgs eld is not yet needed.

 the remaining terms in (43) come from the diagonal x1 = x2. their
cancelation cannot be achieved without h-couplings. this condition yields
important results:19

- the fabcs must full the jacobi identity. (in our simple model this is

already known (46).) 20

- the masses must agree

- the h-coupling parameters take the values

where   {1, 1}. the parameter s is still free.

- there is no term : h 4 : in w (i.e. in rst order in g).
- in t (w (x1)w (x2))|tree the c-number distributions are feynman prop-
agators with derivatives: f (x1  x2), f (x1  x2) and f (x1  x2).
the rst two extend uniquely to the diagonal x1 = x2 and the last one
has a distinguished extension, namely  f (x1  x2) 21. we denote this
extension by t (w (x1)w (x2))|0

(49)

19these results agree precisely with the ones derived from the q-divergence condition

(for second order tree diagrams) in [2], [30] and with [20].

20stora [41] found (for an arbitrary number of massless selnteracting vector elds) that
the q-divergence condition to rst order implies that the coupling parameters are totally
antisymmetric and that the q-divergence condition for second order tree diagrams yields
the jacobi identity.

21the general extension which is poincare covariant (d) and does not increase the scaling

degree (f) reads: f (x1  x2) + cg(x1  x2), c  c arbitrary.

22

(b1, ..., b4  {a, u, u, , h}) can be added to t (w (x1)w (x2))|0
tree, if they
satisfy the properties (b) (poincare covariance), (c) (ghost number), (d) (scal-
ing degree) and (e) (unitarity) which are required above for w (here they
restrict n(x1, x2)). these tree normalization terms (49) correspond to the
quadrilinear terms of order g2 (g denotes the coupling constant) in the inter-
action lagrangian of the conventional theory, they have the same inuence
on the perturbation series of the s-matrix. the cancelation of the terms
x1 = x2 in (43) xes the possible tree normalization terms (i.e. the constants
c in (49)) uniquely (in terms of s), except for 22

(51)

so w and the tree diagram normalizations to second order are completely
determined (up to the sign , which is conventional) and these terms agree
precisely with the interaction lagrangian obtained by the higgs mechanism.
we have made the assumption that there is at most one physical scalar eld
h. this assumption is most probably not necessary. by specializing the
results of [30] to our model (of three selnteracting massive vector elds) one
nds that there is no solution of the q-divergence condition with more than
one h-eld, provided the h-elds couple to the vector or ghost elds.

the higgs potential is not put in here, it is derived from physical con-
sistency. spontaneous symmetry breaking plays no role in this approach,
because we start with the massive free incoming elds. a proof that physical
consistency can be satised to all orders (by choosing suitable normaliza-
tions) is missing up to now, but we are convinced that this holds true.

3 renormalizability and ghosts

the formulation of massive selnteracting vector mesons of the previous sec-
tion will now serve as a point of departure for a more fundamental conceptual
22for the expert we mention that tree normalization terms with b1, ..., b4 exclusively
scalar elds (e.g. nh 4 ) are required. in contrast to the other tree normalization terms
(i.e. the tree normalization terms with vector eld factors) they violate the normalization
condition (n3) in [10] (or (43) in [17]). but this is no harm.

23

discussion. similar to weinberg (weinbergs old work on feynman rules for
higher spin) we start with wigners theory of particle representations; in
our case because we want to avoid any parallelism to (quasi)classical sys-
tems (quantization) and (for reasons which will become gradually clear to
the reader) develop local quantum physics from an intrinsic point of view
as much as possible. in particular we would like to understand the curious
phenomenon that, contrary to the classical situation, the possibilities of per-
turbative renormalizable qft are the more restrictive, the higher the spin.
whereas the classical theory is in need of an additional selection principle
(the gauge principle in case of zero mass), local quantum physics for spin 1
is more restrictive: the particle content and renormalizability x the vector
meson theory (where the possible triviality for spin > 1 is a special case23).
it is this result red backward into (quasi)classical eld theory, which, in the
spirit of bohrs correspondence principle gives a fundamental physical sup-
port for the classical gauge selection principle (which then gives the strong
link with the mathematical-aesthetical appeal to bre bundles). as a side
result we will learn that the massive theory fullls the schwinger-swieca [38]
[43] screening mechanism, and that (similar to the gauge interpretation in
terms of a higgs eld) the theory has more physical degrees of freedom than
the massive vector mesons from which we started in zeroth order, namely
consistent perturbation theory requires the introduction of a scalar h-eld
(the higgs eld without higgs condensate24) of the previous section.

it is well-known that the step from the wigner representation theory of
particles (positive energy irreducible representations of the poincare group
with nite spin/helicity) to local free elds is described in terms of intertwin-
ers u, v25

23in a recent paper scharf and wellmann [31] have shown that there exists no renor-
malizable theory for s=2 which satises the free perturbative operator gauge invariance.
24we use the notation h-eld only in order to avoid any association with higgs con-

densates.

25the letter u, which was used in the previous section for a ghost eld, means here an
intertwiner. the ghost elds in the wigner one-particle space will be denoted by (, , ).
the corresponding fock space elds are the elds (u, u, ) of the previous section.

(2n+ + 1)(2n + 1) component u-spinors into a rectangular (2n+ + 1)(2n +
1)  (2s + 1) matrix u(p) and similar for the vs.
let us rst note that the covariantized inner product in the one-particle
wigner space for s  1 contains necessarily rst or higher powers of mo-
menta. associated with this is the fact that the intertwiners u, v have a
dimension  1 which immediately translates into an operator dimension of
the eld dim  2. since interaction densities w0  w are at least tri-
linear in free elds and since the smallest possible operator dimension is 1
(for scalar elds), it is impossible to satisfy the renormalizability condition
dimw  4 within the stuckelberg-bogoliubov-epstein-glaser operator ap-
proach. inspired by the idea of a cohomological representation of the physical
space and the physical observables in the previous section one looks for a co-
homological extension of the wigner space for massive vector mesons in order
that the associated two-point function (or propagation kernel) has a milder
(renormalizable) high momentum behavior. the results of the previous sec-
tion also suggest the simplest possibility to achieve that, namely to use three
additional indenite metric scalar wave functions (where on the wigner level
the statistics is yet undetermined). more precisely we form an extended
hilbert space hext by the multicomponent wave functions (a, , , ) de-
ned on the mass shell. hext has in addition to a positive denite inner
product another one which does not have this property and corresponds to
the krein structure of the previous section. the latter is relevant in order
to have at least some pseudo-unitary lorentz covariance and a denition of
modular localized subspaces. on hext we dene a brs-like operator by

i.e. we obtain the l2-closure of the space of transversal vector wave functions
which in terms of the associated elds (52) had the high dimension dima = 2
which was responsible for the lack of renormalizable interactions within the
original (non-extended) formulation. (the transversality condition does not
lower the dimension of the vector wave functions or the corresponding elds.)
on the other hand the extended hilbert space has no transversality condition
and obeys the classical assignment of dimensions (i.e. dima = 1 in hext).
this is due to the fact that ghost contributions damp the high momentum
behavior of the associated two-point function.26

the extension has however an inuence on the modular localization the-
ory in wigner space where the latter is (via the ccr/car functor) the pre-
empted locality in fock space. for example the wedge (rindler or bisognano-
wichmann) localized subspace involves instead of the simple complex-conjugation
in addition the krein operator  i.e. one has for the action of the pre-tomita
operator27

(s)(p) = ()(p).

(56)

4 f 2 + 1

26in the lagrangean framework there is an alternative method to lower the dimension
of the massive vector eld a from 2 to 1. in contrast to massless vector elds, the proca
eld (l =  1
2 m2a2, f   a  a) has a well-dened propagator without
introducing a gauge xing term, but it has dimension dima = 2. stuckelbergs trick
is to add a gauge xing term l1 =  1
2 (  a)2,  > 0 (this misleading terminology
is chosen because because l1 has the same form as the gauge xing lagrangean in the
massless case), which damps the high momentum behavior of the propagator such that
dima = 1. in this stuckelberg formalism, the necessity to introduce ghosts shows up in
the fact that without ghosts it is impossible to dene a stable physical subspace or factor
space. for  = 1 (feynman gauge) (7) one obtains the same free vector elds as in the
quantization of the cohomological extension of the wigner one-particle space. we prefer
the latter method, because we do not want to rely on a lagrangean framework, instead
we want to be close to the particle picture.

27the pre-tomita operator s has nothing to do with the above nilpotent operators sw

(54) (in the one particle wigner space) or s (57) in fock space.

where  is the multi-component wave function involving the ghosts in addi-
tion to the vector potential. the standard modular localization theory can be
found in [33] and the adaptation to the present extended pseudo-modular
case will be treated in a separate paper. the physical wigner subspace (more
precisely it is a cohomologically dened factor space) is precisely character-
ized by the validity of the correct modular localization associated with
the tomita theory. although our ghost extension of the (m,s=1) wigner
representation is not uniquely xed (we chose a minimal extension) we be-
lieve that any other cohomological extension which also lowers the dima = 2
down to its classical value dima = 1 will contain the minimal and possible
additional pieces which do not change the physical content28.

the next step from particles to elds is the answer to the question of
what is the action of sw on the multi particle tensor space [9]. from the
usual fock space formalism we are used to the following action of derivations
 on tensor products

(1  2) = 1  2 + 1  2

it is easy to see that the tensor product action of sw must include a grading
in order to maintain the nilpotency

s(1  2) = s1  2 + 1()degree 1  s2,

(57)

where s denotes the fock space version of sw .29 so, two of the three scalar
ghost elds (u, u, )30, which are companions of each massive vector meson
eld, are required to be graded fermionic elds and the third one must be
bosonic.

in this way we obtain the fock space formalism of the previous section
with [q,] being the implementation of s in fock space. whereas the ghost
formalism can be pursued back into the wigner one-particle theory, the neces-
sity to choose trilinear couplings at rst order in g with coecients fullling
group theoretical symmetry, as well as the necessity of enlargement of the

28the geometrical faddeev-popov method can also be considered as a minimal extension
of the functional measure. it owes its unique appearance more to geometric than quantum
physical reasoning.

29from the context it should be clear whether we mean by the letter s the present

nilpotent fock space operator s or the spin.

30we recall that (u, u, ) are the fock space elds of the previous section and correspond

to (, , ) in the wigner one-particle space.

27

vector meson setup by additional physical degrees of freedom (whose sim-
plest and perhaps only realization are the scalar h-elds) only shows up as
a consistency requirement above the zeroth order.

4 determination by field content

in the second section physical consistency was formulated for the s-matrix
(31). we are now looking for a corresponding condition in terms of inter-
acting elds. such elds (including composites) are dened by means of the
bogoliubov transition functional s(g) (1) in fock space as formal power se-
ries in g0. the interacting eld wj int(x; g0w ) due to the interaction w  w0
and corresponding to the wick polynomial wj, j = 1, ..., g of free elds, is
dened by

wj int(x; g0w ) 



igj(x)

s(g0, 0, ..., 0)1s(g0, 0, ..., gj, 0, ...)|gj=0.

(58)

by inserting (1) one obtains the perturbative expansion of the interacting
elds

wj int(x; g0w ) = wj(x) +



xn=1

in

n!z d4x1...d4xn g0(x1)...g0(xn)r(w (x1)...w (xn); wj(x)),

(59)

with the totally retarded products

r(a1(x1)...an(xn); a(x))  xi{1,...,n}

(1)|i| t (ai(xi), i  i)t (ak(xk), k  i c, a(x)),

(60)

where a1, ..., an, a are wick polynomials, i c  {1, ..., n} \ i and t denotes
the anti-chronological product. the corresponding generating functional is
s(g)1. the anti-chronological products can be obtained uniquely from the
time ordered products by the usual inversion of a formal power series

t (a1(x1)...an(xn)) = xppart{1,...,n}

(1)|p|+nypp

t (ai(xi), i  p).

(61)

28

by means of causality (4) one easily nds that the r-products (60) have
totally retarded support with respect to the distinguished coordinate x.
supp r(a1(x1)...an(xn); a(x))  {(x1, ...xn; x) | xi  x + v, i = 1, ...n}.
(62)

in a pure massive theory the strong adiabatic limit of the interacting elds
exists as a formal power series in g := g0(0):

wj int(x)  wj int(x; w )  lim
0

wj int(x; g0 w ), where

g0 (x)  g0(x),   d,

(63)

because this holds true for s(g) (6) [18].

a -symmetrical interacting eld in the adiabatic limit (i.e. int(x) 
int(x; w ) = lim0 int(x; g0 w ), int = int) is called physical (or an ob-
servable) if it induces a well-dened operator on the factor space hphys (22).
this holds true i

together we obtain int(f ) ran q  ran q.)

far (ii) can be weakened such that the uniqueness of fint does not get lost.
due to the normalization condition (f) (scaling degree) for the time or-
dered products, the property (iii) implies dimf 
a int  4. to specify (iv), (v)
and (vi) note that they must be fullled in particular by the wick monomials
ak (in the case of (vi) the coecients ck are also involved: ckak = ckak).
however, these three requirements also restrict the normalization of the
higher orders of 
a int. it is easy to see that these additional nor-
malization conditions can be fullled (e.g. by antisymmetrization in (, ) of
an arbitrary poincare covariant extension) and we assume that the normal-
izations are always done in such a way.

by denition we may assume vdabc = vdacb.

we require that the interaction density w satises the properties (a)-(e)
listed in section 2. the physical consistency of the s-matrix [q, s]|ker q = 0
is omitted here, we replace it by [q,fint(x; w )] = 0 (see (69) below).
in
particular we require dimw  4 which ensures renormalizability. addition-
ally we assume that w contains no quadrilinear terms. most probably this
assumption is not necessary, i.e. the other requirements (including the physi-
cality (66)) exclude the quadrilinear terms. but this still needs to be checked
and will be left open here.

we now replace the requirement (66) by

[q,f 

a int(x; w )] = 0.

(69)

this may be justied in the following way32. since we are working in the
adiabatic limit our q (36) (constructed in terms of incoming free elds) agrees
with the kugo-ojima operator qint [25], [10] which implements the brst-
transformation of the interacting elds. hence [q,f 
a int(x; w )] is again a
local operator. but by the reeh-schlieder theorem [27] such an operator is
zero if it vanishes on the vacuum, which is an element of the kernel of q.
thus the requirements (66) and (69) are equivalent.33

coecients (here the coecients are constants).

31by denition the map   int ( a wick monomial) is linear with c-functions as
32we thank klaus fredenhagen for bringing this argument to our attention.
33this argument cannot be applied to [q, s]|ker q = 0 (31), because the s-matrix is

non-local.

31

the main (completely new) result of this section is that the physicality
(69) xes the parameters tdab, ..., zda in the ansatz (67) and the interaction
w (including the tree normalization terms to second order (49)) up to the
same non-uniqueness as in section 2, namely the addition of divergence- and
coboundary couplings to w (39). especially we will see that an additional
physical degree of freedom is required:
the higgs eld h is needed in the
interaction w as well as in the eld f 
d int.

we verify this statement in appendix b by explicit calculation of the tree
diagrams to lowest orders. we do this only for the simplest non-trivial model,
namely three selnteracting massive vector elds (ma > 0, a = 1, 2, 3) as in
section 2. we make the same ansatz for w as in section 2 , but without the
quadrilinear terms. up to divergence- and coboundary couplings (39) this
is the most general trilinear ansatz which fullls the requirements (a)-(e) of
section 2.

the parameters in the ansatz for w and f 

d int (67) are determined by
inserting these expressions into the physicality requirement (69). here we
only state the results:

- for w we obtain precisely the same expression as in section 2,
- we have computed the parameters in fint (which are formal power series)

to get a better understanding of the latter result we identify these physi-

finally some more remarks on the validity of the schwinger-swieca screen-
ing property are in order. since the physical eld strength is an operator in
hilbert space (positive denite metric) which fullls a maxwell type equa-
tion and since the particle spectrum has an isolated mass hyperboloid for
the vector meson, the theorem of swieca [43] is applicable and hence the
charge dened in terms of the large surface integral over the physical eld
strength vanishes. this charge screening is more interesting if additional
spinor matter is present.

34to avoid problems of dening products of interacting elds (this can be done by means

of (58)) and the brst-transformation thereof, we only consider classical elds here.

33

5 renormalizability for s 1 without ghosts?

we have seen that the cohomological representation of the wigner theory for
vector mesons achieves the magic trick of rescuing renormalizability, whereas
the naive application of the standard causal perturbation theory based on
interactions wphys in terms of local wick polynomials in physical (wigner)
eld coordinates, which inevitably leads to dimwphys  5, fails on the count
of renormalizability35. the trick employs ghosts in intermediate steps in a
way which is reminiscent of a catalyzer in chemistry. this is to say a physi-
cal problem of perturbatively coupled massive spin =1 interactions, which a
priori has nothing to do with ghosts, had to be cohomologically extended, be-
cause that was apparently the only way to reconcile the standard perturbative
machinery (of deformation of free theories by w s) with the short distance
renormalizability requirement. but at the end, after the cohomological de-
scend, one obtains local physical vector meson elds and a physical s-matrix
(both renormalizable) within a physical fock space of massive spin one parti-
cles, together with new physical degrees of freedom. this is a physical result
which totally conceals the intermediate presence of ghosts. although the
nal result agrees formally with (the gauge invariant part of) renormalized
gauge theory, the underlying physical idea and the words used to describe
it are quite dierent. instead of the higgs mechanism, which generates the
s=1 mass through an additionally introduced (by hand) scalar eld with
non-vanishing vacuum expectation value, and which has no visible intrinsic
(gauge-invariant) meaning, the vector meson mass in the present approach is
directly linked with the aforementioned schwinger-swieca screening mecha-
nism. the latter, together with the renormalizability requirement, demands
the presence of additional degrees of freedom which we realized as scalar
particles and identied with the higgs eld without its vacuum condensate.
although we have neither demonstrated uniqueness of the ghosts nor of
the new physical degree of freedom, we believe, that as already mentioned in
the third section, our minimal solution is unique in the sense that any other
solution involving higher spin ghost and induced physical objects always con-
tains our minimal solution (plus possible additional couplings with coupling
parameters which may be set to zero).

35this is a well-known limitation in weinbergs program of using wigners particle
theory as a starting point for perturbative renormalization for massive vector mesons and
higher spin particles.

34

between the two formulations for interacting vector mesons, once as the
quantized version of classical gauge theories with higgs mechanism and on
the other hand the ghost catalyzer to implement perturbative renormal-
ization we prefer the latter because it underlines the preliminary aspect of
our understanding of higher spin interactions more clearly. in this sense it
upholds the bohr-heisenberg maxim that even in cases of discoveries via non-
observable and formal constructs, one should always aim for a reduction to
observable concepts in order to obtain a conceptual profound understanding.
the present formulation also gives a more detailed picture of physical
elds (cf. (70)). whereas their locality and spectral properties are as in a
renormalizable lower spin s<1 coupling, their operator dimension generally
does not have the form of logarithmic corrections on canonical values of la-
grangian elds. rather they involve higher wick-polynomials up to operator
dimension 4 i.e. are composites in the unphysical elds which interpolate el-
ementary (in the sense of a perturbative description only) physical particles.
this is the consequence of the fact that the cohomological descend renders
the standard formulas in terms of retarded r-products invalid. instead of
lagrangian interpolating elds with their canonical dimensions and logarith-
mic radiative corrections we have to work with the physical composites for
the interpolation of the physical particles. the q-invariant linear combina-
tions which represent the physical elds within the extended wick formalism
have no intrinsic meaning or in other words the present formalism has not
supplied us with a formalism which leads to the physical vacuum expectation
values in a more direct and less ad hoc manner. whereas symmetries of a
free eld theory can be used for the selection of a natural invariant subalge-
bra, the selection of a q-invariant subalgebra of wick-polynomials remains a
rather unnatural procedure. whereas an observable subalgebra resulting as
the xpoint algebra of an internal symmetry contains all the structure which
via the superselection theory allows an intrinsic reconstruction of the algebra
of elds, there is no intrinsic natural way to reconstruct the ghost extended
algebra from the physical algebra.
it also indicates that even though the
nal physical degrees of freedom are local and can be described in terms of
covariant point-like elds, the formalism deviates in some way from the
standard local behavior in that the perturbation cannot be interpreted as a
deformation on the original local class (borchers class) of local physical elds
but rather appears as a subclass of a deformed unphysical extended theory
with articial looking rules concerning its position within the extended local
class.
in this way the violation of the bohr-heisenberg maxim about ob-

35

servables in the present description of higher spin interaction becomes most
evident. before we present some ideas about an alternative approach avoid-
ing non-observable aspects, it is helpful to recall how the wigner theory deals
with the vector potential in the case of zero mass i.e. for photons.

on a very formal level (ignoring regularisations of line integrals) we could
in fact also have obtained the lowering of the operator dimension dima from
two to one without any cohomological extension by allowing non-point-like
and non-covariant vector potentials which are interpolating the same particles
as the covariant ones. although on-shell objects as the s-matrix of the nal
qft are unaected, as long as those elds remain almost local in the sense
of [21], it is not known how to deal with such objects in a causal approach
based on interaction polynomials w and transition operators s(g).

it is interesting to note that the wigner theory of free photons does not
allow the introduction of any local covariant vector potential, thus raising
the suspicion that massless spin one interactions formulated in a physical
hilbert space lead to some sort of clash between renormalizability (which
requires vector potentials of dima = 1) and the locality and covariance of
interaction densities w. this problem with vector potentials comes from the
non-compact structure of the little group (stability group) of a light-like vec-
tor say pr = (1, 0, 0, 1), which is the twofold covering of the euclidean group
e(2) (and is denoted by e(2)). whereas the rotation has the interpretation
as a helicity rotation (rotation around the third axis), the translations are
lorentz-transformations which tilt the t-z wedge, leaving its upper light-like
vector unchanged. as far as the two transversal coordinates are concerned
they behave like 2-parametric galilei velocity transformations (i.e. light
cone translations without the energy positivity property) with the two lon-
gitudinal light cone translations playing the role of the hamiltonian resp.
the central mass in the quantum mechanical representation theory of the
galilei group. the embedding of e(2) into sl(2, c) for the above choice of
reference vector is

where  is the angle for the rotations around the 3-axis and  = 1 + i2
parameterizes the euclidean translations by the vector (1, 2). the unitary
representation theory of this non-compact group is somewhat more compli-
cated than that of su(2). but it is obvious that the representations fall

36

into two classes; the neutrino-photon class with u((, 0)) = 1 i.e. triv-
ial representation of the euclidean translations, and the remaining faithful
continuous spin (innite dimensional) representations with u((, 0)) 6= 1.
a more detailed analysis shows that the latter lacks the strong localization
requirements which one must impose on those positive energy representa-
tions which are used for the description of particles.36 hence the wigner
theory does not allow to describe photon operators in terms of covariant vec-
tor elds. on the other hand a covariant eld strength f has the following
intertwiner representation in terms of the wigner annihilation/creation op-
erators for circular polarized photons a#

momentum direction ~n  ~k
 (xed uniquely by the standard prescription
in terms of two euler angles) and a subsequent lorentz-boost along this
direction which transforms (1, ~n) into k = (1, ~n). it is these vectors that do
not behave covariant under those lorentz-transformations which involve the
above little group translations but rather produce an ane transformation

are not invariant under the euclidean translations in e(2), as one would
have expected for a (non-existing!) bona de intertwiner from the (0, h = 1)

i.e. up to ane longitudinal terms. for general lorentz transformations this
ane law reads:

e(1k) + kh(, k)

(82)

this peculiar manifestation of the (0, h = 1) little group e(2) is the cause for
the appearance of the local gauge issue in local quantum physics. unfortu-
nately this quantum origin is somewhat hidden in the quantization approach,
where it remains invisible behind the geometrical interpretation in terms of
bre bundles. in terms of the potential in the physical fock space we have

u()a(x)u() = 1

 a(x) + h

(83)

where h is a concrete operator involving the a#
 and e from (80). for-
mally the string-like localized vector potential (with localization chosen in
the space-like n-direction) may be written as a line integral over the eld
strength

a(x)   a(x) = f(x)
nf y n  a = 0.
a =

n  

(84)

the regularization needed in order to make mathematical sense out of these
string-like objects and related technical problems will not be discussed in this
qualitative presentation. the physical manifestation of the existence of the
somewhat nonlocal vector potential is the breakdown of the additivity of the
algebras generated by the eld strength for non-simply connected regions [21].
the natural localization regions for vector potentials are space-like cones or
wedges which contain such cones. on the other hand the causal perturbation
theory (and any other formulation using lagrangian quantization) requires
point-like elds.

comparing this with the massive case, one notes that the problematic
aspects of the use of vector potentials in the local description of s=1 show up
in the quantum properties of free wigner photons before the renormalization
procedure, whereas for massive vector mesons it appears only in facing the
issue of renormalizability (dimensional counting) of interactions. what is in
common to both cases is the fact that no existing formulation of renormalized

38

perturbation theory is capable to deal with dima = 1 nonlocal vector po-
tentials within the framework of causal wick-polynomials w. both cases can
be dealt with in terms of the same remedy namely cohomological extension
by ghosts within a brs-like formalism; however as a result of the availability
of arguments based on scattering theory, the brs formalism is conceptually
much simpler in the massive case, whereas in the massless theory one must
use the full brs-formalism which suers contribution from interactions and
requires additional concepts for the separation of observable algebras from
physical states [10].

it should be clear from these remarks that in order to follow the bohr-
heisenberg maxim and remove the ghost-catalyzers in favor of a ghost-
free formulation, one has to go signicantly outside the present perturbative
framework. a hint where to look comes from the observation that the ghosts
have been introduced to lower the operator dimension of a from two to
one, while still maintaining the (formal) locality and the covariance of the
operators. this is clearly an o-shell short distance argument. so this obser-
vation suggests to look for an on-shell formulation. on-shell quantities are
the true s-matrix and formfactors of physical operators a between multi-
particle scattering states:

s |p1, ...pniout = |p1, ...pniin
out hp1...pm| a|p1, ...pniin

(85)

note that we dened the formfactors in such a way that the matrix elements
of s themselves correspond to the formfactor of the identity operator. so
the rst question is: can one compute the perturbative expansion of s while
staying on-shell all the time. the causal approach used before does not
fulll this requirement, since the bogoliubov transition operator s(g) is o
shell (in the sense of this paper) and only approaches the mass shell in the
adiabatic limit37. in fact it is not possible to formulate causality which in-
volves products of elds directly on-shell, rather the on-shell substitute is the
notoriously elusive crossing symmetry together with some inexorably linked
subtle analytic continuation properties. so the question is: does there exist a

37the dierence between on- and o-shell looks quite innocuous in momentum space,
however the spacetime aspects could be dierent. in order to illustrate this point, just
look at the massive thirring model. the s(g) resp. the eld correlation functions show
the full eld theoretic vacuum- and one-particle polarization structure (virtual particle
structure) whereas the s-matrix and the closely related pfg wedge generators (which are
introduced below) are quantum mechanical i.e. obey particle number conservation.

39

formulation of quantum eld theory which, dierent from quantization, uses
such on-shell concepts in its construction.

fortunately the beginning of such a new approach to qft already exists
[32][36]. this approach can be viewed as a generalization of the wigner
theory in the presence of interactions.
it bypasses completely the use of
point-like elds and aims directly at the wedge algebras and the associated
net of smaller localized algebras obtained by intersecting wedge algebras.

it is deeply satisfying that the modular theory used in this construction
directly converts the wigner one particle theory into the interaction free nets
of algebras without using elds and their equivalence classes in intermediate
steps. the generalization to interacting models is given by the modular inter-
pretation of the s-matrix as a relative modular invariant which measures
the interaction for wedge-localized algebras. the naturalness of the wedge
region appeared for the rst time long ago in unruhs minkowski space ana-
logue of the hawking thermal aspects of black holes. indeed, its use for a
generalization of the wigner approach in the presence of interactions leads
rather swiftly to a profound understanding of two aspects: the relation of
the thermal aspect of modular (wedge) localization with the aforementioned
elusive crossing symmetry of particle physics, and the existence of genera-
tors of the wedge algebra which, applied to the vacuum, create one particle
states free of particle-antiparticle polarization clouds, despite the presence
of interactions. the crossing is known to be closely related to the tcp
theorem; in fact it is a kind of tcp property for individual particle in form-
factors whereby the particle in an incoming conguration is ipped into an
(analytically continued) outgoing anti-particle. the existence of (vacuum)
polarization free generators (abbreviated pfg) for wedge localized alge-
bras on the other hand is a new discovery. their correlation functions can be
expressed in terms of nested products of s-matrices [36]. a closer look has
revealed that in the special case of d=1+1 purely elastic s-matrices (factor-
izing models [24][39]) the pfgs in fact obey the zamolodchikov-faddeev
algebra, and that the latter receives in turn for the rst time a physical
spacetime interpretation which transcends its formal use [33][34][35][36].

the potential relevance of these remarks for a ghostfree formulation of
higher spin interactions becomes clearer if one notices that the reasons for
their introduction is that the point-like interaction densities wphys in terms
of physical higher spin elds have a short distance behavior beyond the one
allowed by the formal renormalizability criterion.
if we could avoid such
o-shell objects as point-like elds and their correlation functions in favor

40

of formfactors of localized operators (85) then the existence of the theory
would not be threatened by the short distance behavior in the construction
of the theory. rather it would come out from the denition of formfactors of
products of such operators by summing over the complete set of intermediate
particle states. the rst step in such a new construction program namely the
construction of the pfgs belonging to the model is purely on-shell and only
involves physical particles. the correlation functions of pfgs are on-shell
objects, in the old fashioned language they contain a natural cuto as a re-
sult of their somewhat de-localized nature, but unlike the brutal force cutos
in the lagrangian approach, these objects coexist in the same hilbert space
together with sharper localized operators which belong to intersections of
wedge algebras. the non-triviality check in this approach, which is expected
to replace the good short distance behavior in the standard renormalization
theory, is the non-triviality of algebras localized in double cones obtained by
intersecting wedges

a(o) = owa(w )

(86)

it may not be widespread known, but it is nevertheless true that all physical
informations are contained in local algebras38 and that there is no necessity
from a conceptual point of view to use point-like eld coordinates apart from
certain distinguished point-like currents related to symmetries and possibly
associated order/disorder elds.

the rst step, namely the construction of the on-shell pfgs is rem-
iniscent of attempts in the 60ies to construct unitary crossing symmetric
s-matrices. this attempt, even in its limited perturbation version, was ill-
fated and did not lead to tangible results. it remained as a very fundamental
problem in particle physics closely related to the inverse problem i.e. the
question to what extend a physically admissible (on-shell) s-matrix deter-
mines uniquely an (o-shell) algebraic net. the modular approach to wedge
algebras and the concept of pfgs incorporates and enriches this old s-matrix
program, so that it becomes the rst step in a construction of local nets. the
hope that in this new version it becomes at least susceptible to a kind of on-
shell perturbation theory rests on the new eld theoretic setting together
with rich new concepts which were absent in the days of the old bootstrap
program. in fact the success of this program for d=1+1 factorizing models

38this independence of the physical content from eld coordinatizations is the main

reason for the interest in the algebraic approach (i.e. local quantum physics).

41

[24][39] (in which case such an s-matrix which avoids the standard construc-
tion exists even in a summed up non-perturbative form) may be taken as an
encouragement for a future exploration of this new approach to qft.

one expects that this new approach reproduces the perturbative results
of the standard renormalization theory wherever the latter is applicable. the
innovative power of the new approach is expected to show up in situations
where one has reasons to believe that lagrangian quantization does not pro-
vide physical eld coordinates of sucient low operator dimension related to
good short distance properties needed for the ws in the causal approach.
there is no a priori reason why the lagrangian elds should be the ones
with the lowest short distance dimensions in the local equivalence class of all
local elds of one model. in the case of spin=1 one can still overcome such
obstacles against the standard formulations by the ad hoc ghost trick which
is suggested by the quantization of gauge theories. but could there also be
(e.g. higher spin) cases with a nite number of coupling parameters which
are declared non-renormalizable in the standard approach, even though
they have a well-dened perturbation theory in the new sense?

6 future perspectives

the history of gauge theory and its connection with higher spin renormal-
izable qft is one of the theoretically most fascinating and experimentally
most signicant developments in the 20th century. contrary to a widely held
opinion this is still an unnished story with possible future surprises.

the usefulness of the role of the gauge principle as a selection principle
in the classical setting and its attractive geometric appeal in the semiclassical
realm of quantum matter coupled to external elds (minimal electromagnetic-
coupling) is universally recognized. acknowledging its important role in
the discovery of the renormalization of interactions between massive vec-
tor mesons, we nevertheless tried to argue in this paper that further progress
in this area requires new ideas beyond those of standard gauge theory, which
are of a more algebraic (or local quantum physical) than dierential geo-
metric kind. as a compromise between the standard approach and a future
ghostfree framework we presented a formulation of interactions of massive
vector mesons using ghosts which extend the wigner one-particle states of
the vector meson. in this formulation the necessity of the presence of further
higgs like physical degrees of freedom is most easily recognizable, even though

42

they have been stripped of their role of fattening the photons/gluons into
massive vector mesons via higgs condensates since their mass was assumed
non-vanishing from the outset. it is interesting to note that even without
this role their presence is nevertheless necessary for perturbative consistency
and the schwinger-swieca charge screening mechanism. although we hope
that this formulation will only be intermediary and replaced eventually by
a ghostfree modular approach (the remarks in the previous section), it is in
our view already with all its shortcomings better suitable than the standard
gauge approach to highlight those points which suggest the necessity of a
radically dierent formulation.

the viewpoint in this paper is in some ways opposite to the standard one.
whereas standardly the massless case is used as the basic reference and the
mass of vector mesons is attributed to the higgs mechanism in gauge theo-
ries which follows more the geometric logic of classical eld theory, we have
favored a particle viewpoint which emphasizes the physical particle interpre-
tation and leaves the more dicult o-shell infrared rearrangements in the
massless limit to future more detailed investigations. whether a completely
ghostfree formulation (which fully explains the gauge-restricted structure of
interacting higher spin objects as consequences of the same basic local quan-
tum physical properties which hold for low spins) is feasible, only future can
tell.

we also mentioned various historical precedents to our point of view. in
this context it is interesting to add a quotation from a paper of p.w anderson
[1]. about the possible non-intrinsic aspect of the higgs mechanism for
massive photons in comparison to plasmons he writes: how, then, if we
were conned to a plasma as we are to the vacuum and could only measure
renormalized quantities, might we try to determine whether, before turning
on the eects of electromagnetic interaction, a (the vector potential) had
been a massless gauge eld and... ? as far as we can see this is not possible.
the lack of intrinsic physical meaning of higgs condensates was also the main
issue of the well-known elitzurs theorem.

if by our observations on massive vector mesons we succeed to re-direct
some of the attention which has been given to geometric/mathematical as-
pects towards the many open and interesting conceptual local quantum prob-
lems, the time it took for writing this paper was well spent.

7 appendix a: the s-matrix to rst order

first we give an incomplete proof of the following statement (which is of
general interest):

conjecture: let v (x) be an arbitrary wick polynomial with derivatives
(i.e. an arbitrary element of the borchers class of the free elds) and let all
free elds be massive. then the relation

lim

0z d4x v (x)g(x) = 0,

(g  d(r4),

g(0) = 1)

(87)

implies that there exists another wick polynomial (with derivatives) w 
that

1 such

v = w 

1 + v0.

(88)

thereby v0 is the sum of all wick monomials c : a1 aj1(x)...an ajn(x) :
(c =const., aj is a free eld with mass mj) in v for which the masses
mj1, ..., mjn are such that the solution for (k1, ..., kn)  r4n of
jl l = 1, ..., n
l = m2

jl l = 1, ..., n.
a simple example for a term in v0 is : (x)3 :, where ((cid:3) + m2) = 0, m >

contains no non-empty open subset of the manifold k2

k1 + ... + kn = 0 ^ k2

l = m2

(89)

0.

incomplete proof:39 to simplify the notations we assume that the free
elds are bosonic scalars, the generalization to other types of elds is obvious.
global factors 2 are omitted in the whole proof. we write v in the form

v (x) =xn xj1,...,jn

pj1...jn(x1, ..., xn) : aj1(x1)...ajn(xn) : |x1=...=xn=x,

(90)

where the sum over n is nite, the ajs are free elds and pj1...jn(x1 , ..., xn)
is a polynomial in the partial derivatives xl
 , 1  l  n. obviously we may
replace pj1...jn(x1 , ..., xn) by

pj1...jn(x1 , ..., xn) 

1

n! xsn

pj(1)...j(n)(x(1), ..., x(n))

(91)

39klaus fredenhagen told us the main idea of proof. the method is strongly inuenced

by the proof of lemma 2 (including appendix (b)) in [7].

al(y) =z d4p (p2  m2

al(p) := [(p0)al(~p) + (p0)b+

l (~p)]

(92)

(al = bl is possible), where [bl(~p), b+

(here we have exchanged the order of the integrations and the limit   0.
this can be justied by considering matrix elements between wave packets.)
taking improper matrix elements < b+
of (93), where  is the vacuum of the free elds, we obtain40

rs(~ks)|...a+

l > 0 for l = 1, ..., s and k0

more precisely k0
l < 0 for l = s + 1, ..., t. if r1, ..., rt
are such that the corresponding term belongs to (v  v0), then the condition
(94) restricts the polynomial pr1...rt in the following way. we make a taylor
expansion with respect to k = (k1 + ... + kt) at k = 0:
pr1...rt(ik1, ..., ikt) = pr1...rt(ik1, ..., ikt1,i(k1 + ... + kt1)) + ik q

r1...rt(k1, ..., kt)

(95)

where q
r1...rt is also a polynomial. from (94) we conclude (for all (r1, ..., rt)
which appear in (v v0)) that pr1...rt(ik1, ..., ikt1,i(k1+...+kt1)) vanishes
ators. all give the same contribution due to the permutation symmetry of pr1...rt (91).

40usually there are several possibilities to contract the creation and annihilation oper-

45

on a non-empty open subset of the manifold k2
ri i = 1, ..., t  1 and
(k1 + ... + kt1)2 = m2
rt. we strongly presume that this implies that there
exist other polynomials p (l)(k1, ..., kt1) (l = 1, ..., t) (for simplicity we omit
the indices r1, ..., rt) such that

i = m2

p (ik1, ..., ikt1,i(k1 + ...kt1)) =

for vanishing masses this conjecture has been proved by buchholz and fre-
denhagen (in appendix (b) of [7]).41 by means of (96) we conclude

where q(ik1, ..., ikt) := i(k1+...+kt1kt)p (t)(k1, ..., kt1)+ q(k1, ..., kt).
next we symmetrize q according to (91) and denote the result by q. the
equation (97) holds still true if we replace q by q. summing up we obtain

(we set q

41unfortunately a straightforward generalization of their proof does not work. however,

for our purpose we do not need the validity of (96).

46

we do not need the general result (87-89), we only deal with very special

situations. physical consistency (31) to rst order means

lim

0z d4x g(x)[q, w (x)]|ker q = 0.

(98)

let us rst consider the quadrilinear terms in v (x) := [q, w (x)], i.e. [q, w (x)(4)],
where w (4) : aaaa :, : aauu :, : uuuu :, :  :, : aa :, :
uu :, : h 2 :, : aah 2 :, : uuh 2 :, : h 4 : (the upper index (4)
refers to the quadrilinear terms). they satisfy the kinematical equations
(89) for a sucient big set of momenta, i.e. they belong to (v  v0).42 the
polynomials pj1...jn (90) (and hence also p (91)) are of the form

p (ik1, ..., ik4) = c0

or

p (ik1, ..., ik4) =

cik
i ,

4

xi=1

where c0 and ci are constants. taking matrix elements of (98) with improper
two-particle states, where the incoming state is an element of ker q, we obtain
(94), which implies p = 0 or p  = c(k
4 ) (c =constant). hence (98)
implies that there exists a wick polynomial w (4)

1 + ... + k

such that

1

[q, w (x)(4)] = i w (4)

1

(x).

this is the q-divergence condition to rst order (29). in addition w (4) must
satisfy the requirements (a)-(e) listed in section 2. the only solution is
: h 4 : [20], but such a term will be excluded by physical consistency (31)
to second order.
a trilinear term in w (x) (with masses m1, m2 and m3) fullls the kine-
matical equations (89) for a sucient big set i there exists a permutation
  s3 such that

m(3) > m(1) + m(2).

(99)

but physical consistency to higher orders will require m1 = m2 = m3 =: m
apart from the h-couplings (mh > 0 will not be restricted; see sect. 2).

42for a free eld  note that [q, (x)] satises the same eld equation as  and hence

has the same mass.

47

neglecting this exception we conclude from (93) that the trilinear part s(3)
1
of the s-matrix to rst order vanishes in the adiabatic limit, i.e.

s(3)
1 = lim

0z d4x g(x)w (3)(x) = 0,

(100)

and [q, s(3)
1 ] = 0 (31) is trivially satised. to get restrictions on w (3) we
must consider physical consistency (31) to orders n  2, especially for second
order tree diagrams.

8 appendix b: determination of the parame-
ters in w and fint by requiring [q,fint(x; w )] =
0

the calculation is lengthy, hence we concentrate on the essential points.
we determined the parameters in the ansatz for w (41) and fint (67) by
inserting these expressions into the physicality requirement (69) to lowest
perturbative orders. once a parameter is xed, its value will be used in the
following calculations without mentioning it.

- to zeroth order the condition is trivially fullled due to43

[q, f 

d ] = 0.

- to rst order the equation

[q,f (1)

d (x)] + iz dx1 [q, r(w (x1); fd(x))] = 0

(101)

(102)

is required. the second term contains tree diagrams only. by means of (60)
they can be written in the form

r(w (x1); f 

+(x  x1)ic

d (x)) = (x0  x0

c (x1) :,

d (x), w (x1)]

(103)

43if we would not have made the assumption c(0)
k = 0 (i), we would nd here that most of
the zeroth order coecients must vanish. it would remain f  (0)
a h+z(0)
da :
a h 2 : only. x(0) and z(0) are then forced to vanish by higher orders of (69). but this
f 
complicates the calculation a lot and the assumption c(0)
k = 0 is reasonable. so we do not
do this eort here.

where c is an arbitrary constant. the terms  (x0  x0
1) have propagators
ret(x x1), ret(x x1), ret(x x1), where ret is the retarded funda-
mental solution of the klein gordon equation, supp ret  v +. the term 
c(x x1) is due to the non-uniqueness of the extension of t (w (x1)f 
d (x))
to the diagonal x1 = x2. this is similar to the tree normalization terms
(49). the tensor fbcd which is the same as in the ansatz for w 44 is antisym-
metrized according to the normalization condition f 
d int (iv). now
let 1, 2 be arbitrary free elds and y1, y2  r4, (yj  x)2 < 0 (j = 1, 2).
by commuting (102) with 1(y1) and 2(y2) we obtain

d int = f 

0 =z dx1 [[[q, [fd(x), w (x1)]], 1(y1)], 2(y2)](x0  x0

1).

(104)

we conclude that for x1  (x + v ) \ {x} the expression [q, [fd(x), w (x1)]]
must be a divergence of a local operator with respect to x1,45 i.e. there must
exist a two-point distribution r

1d(x1, x) with

(x0  x0

1)[q, [fd(x), w (x1)]] = x1

 r

1d(x1, x) + (x  x1)pd(x),

(105)

where pd(x) is a wick polynomial (with constant coecients) in free elds
(possibly with derivative). in contrast to the adiabatic limit of w (87) there
is no kinematical restriction (in the sense of (89)) here, because one of the
free eld operators in w (x1) is contracted with f (x) and, hence, the corre-
sponding momentum must not be on-shell. we have not worked out a general
proof (in the style of appendix a) of the step from (104) to (105). but the
explicit calculations show that this conclusion is correct.46
inserting (105)
and (103) into (102) it results

(106)

which means that the local terms47 must satisfy the condition (102) sep-
arately. later when we shall know more about w (which determines pd by
44we use here an additional normalization condition, namely that the term  c(xx1)
: aa : has the same color tensor as the corresponding non-local term (i.e. the term in
(x0  x0

45note that every operator valued distribution g(x1, ..., xn), (xj  r4) can be writ-
 r dy d...(x1 

1)[f (x), w (x1)] with the same external legs).

46this remark concerns also the analogous (more complicated) steps from (110) to (113)

and from (129) to (130) in second and third order.

47we set quotation marks because the splitting of a distribution in a local and a non-local

(105)), we will compute most of the coecients in f (1)

obviously this condition is truly weaker than [q, w ] =(divergence of a wick

yield more information about w .

and 3(y3) only the terms (109) survive (the terms  c1(x  x1) in (109)
do not contribute either)

0 = z dx1dx2 [[[[q, r(w (x1)w (x2); fd(x))|tree], 1(y1)], 2(y2)], 3(y3)]
= z dx1dx2 [[[[q,{[fd(x), t (w (x1)w (x2))]  w (x1)[fd(x), w (x2)]

w (x2)[fd(x), w (x1)]}|tree], 1(y1)], 2(y2)], 3(y3)],

(110)

where we have inserted (60), (61) and the causal factorization (4) of the
time ordered products due to x 6 {x1, x2} + v . similarly to the step

48note that totally retarded products (60) contain connected diagrams only.

50

from (104) to (105) we conclude that [q, r(w (x1)w (x2); fd(x))|tree] must
be a sum of divergences (with respect to x1 or x2) of local operators for
x1, x2  (x + v ) \ {x}. now we transform (110) by means of identities of
the kind

[q, (m(x)n(y))|tree] = [q, m(x)n(y)]|tree

(111)
= ([q, m(x)]n(y))|tree + (m(x)[q, n(y)])|tree,(112)
where m and n are arbitrary wick polynomials. then using (101) and (107)
we nd the condition

[fd(x), [q, t (w (x1)w (x2))]]|tree  [q, w (x1)][fd(x), w (x2)]|tree
[q, w (x2)][fd(x), w (x1)]|tree = divx1 + (x1  x2)

(113)
for x1, x2  (x + v ) \ {x}, where divy means some divergence of a local
operator with respect to y. next we specialize to the subregion x0
1 > x0
2,
where t (w (x1)w (x2)) factorizes. by means of again (107) we see that w
must satisfy
[[fd(x), w (x1)], [q, w (x2)]]|tree = divx1 + divx2 for x1, x2  (x + v ) \ {x}, x0
(114)

1 > x0
2.

inserting the ansatz for w into this condition one nds that (114) yields the
same restrictions on the parameters in w as the q-divergence condition to
rst order (29):

[q, w ] = divergence of a wick polynomial.

(115)

in other words we obtain the same results for the parameters in w as in (45),
especially fabc = abc. we recall that these values of the parameters are not
only necessary for (115), they are also sucient. hence (107) is also fullled.
by inserting (115) into (113) we nd the condition

[fd(x), [q, t (w (x1)w (x2))|tree]] = divx1 + (x1  x2)

for x1, x2  (x + v ) \ {x}.

(116)

this is a necessary but not sucient condition for [q, t (w (x1)w (x2))|tree] =
divx1 + (x1  x2). to get the full information of this latter condition we
need to go to third order.

51

- however, rst we return to the local terms to rst order (106), because
we shall need the validity of this equation. we explicitly calculate the terms
on the l.h.s. of (105), transform them into divergence form (as far as possible)
and obtain49

p 
d = bcd[f 

b uc  a

b  uc + a

(117)

inserting this into (106) we nd that (106) is fullled i the normalization

y(1) = 0,

y(1) = 0,

z(1) = 0.(119)

x(1) and z(1) are still arbitrary. note that (107), (118) and (119) are not only
necessary for (102), together they are also sucient.

- we now consider the condition (69) to third order, i.e. the analogous
equation to (102), (108). by commuting this equation with arbitrary free
elds 1(y1), 2(y2), 3(y3), 4(y4), (yl  x)2 < 0 l, we obtain

0 =

only tree diagrams of the following types contribute (we use the same nota-
tions as in (109)): in the rst term

of fd(x) with a(x1) in the rst term of w (x1) (41).

(123)

where the dots mean terms obtained by cyclic permutations. in the rst term
in (120) we take (60) and the causal factorization basing on x 6 ({x2, x3} +
v ) into account. by means of (115) it results
2!z dx2dx3 [[[[{[[q,f (1)(x)], t (w (x2)w (x3))]  w (x2)[[q,f (1)(x)], w (x3)]

i2

w (x3)[[q,f (1)(x)], w (x2)]}|tree, 1(y1)]..., 4(y4)].(124)

additionally we have used that due to (121) only the disconnected diagram of
t (w (x2)
w (x3)) contributes, hence [...[f (1)(x), [q, t (w (x2)w (x3))]]..., 4(y4)] = divx2+
divx3 by (115).

in the second term in (120) the situation is more complicated. the
diagrams of the type (123) obey the causal factorization basing on x 6
({x1, x2, x3} + v ). but for the diagrams of the type (122) we only know
x 6 ({x2, x3} + v ) (or promulgated congurations). to x the position of
the third vertex we consider two smooth functions h1, h2 with

1 = h1(y) + h2(y) y  x + v ,

h1  d(r4),

x  supp h1,

supp h2  x + v + = ,

(yl  z)2 < 0 z  supp h1, l = 1, 2, 3, 4.(125)

with that the second term in (120) can be written in the form

i3

3!z dx1dx2dx3 (h1(x1)h2(x2)h2(x3) + h2(x1)h1(x2)h2(x3) + h2(x1)h2(x2)h1(x3)
+h2(x1)h2(x2)h2(x3))[...[q, r(w (x1)...; f (x))|tree]..., 4(y4)].

(126)

in the terms with a factor h1(xl) the diagrams of the type (122) contribute
only, and we may insert the causal factorization due to {x, xl}  ({xj, xk} +
v ) =  (where {l, j, k} = {1, 2, 3}). so the contribution of (h1(x1)h2(x2)h2(x3)+
h2(x1)h1(x2)h2(x3) + h2(x1)h2(x2)h1(x3)) in (126) reads
2!z dx1dx2dx3 h1(x1)h2(x2)h2(x3)[...{[[q, r(w (x1); f (x))], t (w (x2)w (x3))]
w (x2)[[q, r(w (x1); f (x))], w (x3)]

where we have used [q, t (w (x2)w (x3))] = divx2 + divx3, which holds true
here for the same reason as in (124). from (102) and (103) we know

[q,f (1)(x)] + iz dx1 h1(x1)[q, r(w (x1); f (x))] =

iz dx1 h2(x1)[q, r(w (x1); f (x))] = iz dx1 h2(x1)x1

 [f (x), w 

1 (x1)],(128)

where we have used [q, w ] =  w 
(124) into (120). by means of (128) we obtain

1 (115). we now insert (127), (126) and

i3

 ([[f (x), w 

1 (x1)], w (x2)])|tree  x2(...)  x3(...)}..., 4(y4)],
where x2(...) and x3(...) are obtained from x1(...) by cyclic permutation.
the next step is analogous to the step from (104) to (105), but more compli-
cated because one has to care about the cancelation of the boundary terms.
taking the freedom in the choice of h2 into account, (129) is equivalent to
the existence of a local operator r

3(x1; x2, x3; x) with

1 (x1)], w (x3)]

(129)

[q, r(w (x1)w (x2)w (x3); f (x))]|tree = x1

 r

x1, x2, x3  (x + v ) \ {x},

3(x1; x2, x3; x) + cyclic permutations,

because the contribution from e.g. x1(...) in (129) is equal to

i3



3!z dx1dx2dx3 ( h2)(x1)h2(x2)h2(x3)[...r

3(x1; x2, x3; x)..., 4(y4)].

(131)

let us explain this latter statement. first note that due to (62) and (125)
there is only a contribution in (131) for x1, x2, x3  (x + v ) \ {x}  x1 6
({x2, x3} + v ). in this region we have

r(w (x1)w (x2)w (x3); f (x)) = [[f (x), w (x1)], t (w (x2)w (x3))]
w (x2)[[f (x), w (x1)], w (x3)]
w (x3)[[f (x), w (x1)], w (x2)] (132)

3(x1;

due to causal factorization. now we take into account that (in this region)
x1
 r
x2, x3; x) comes from the [q, w (x1)]-terms in [q, r(w w w ; f )] (where r(w w w ; f )
is given by (132)). however, by replacing w (x1) by  w 
obtain exactly the x1(...)-term in (129).

1 (x1) in (132) we

by means of causal factorization and (101), (115), (116) the condition

(130) can be written in the form

{[f (x), [q, t (w (x1)w (x2)w (x3))]] + [q, t (w (x2)w (x3))][w (x1), f (x)]
+[q, t (w (x1)w (x2))][w (x3), f (x)] + [q, t (w (x1)w (x3))][w (x2), f (x)]}|tree
(133)

= divx1 + cyclic permutations
for x1, x2, x3  (x + v ) \ {x}. next we specialize to the subregion x1 6
({x2, x3}+ v ). again by causal factorization and (116) we nd that t (w (x2)w (x3))
must fulll

[[f (x), w (x1)], [q, t (w (x2)w (x3))]]|tree = divx1 + divx2 + divx3

(134)
for x1, x2, x3  (x + v ) \ {x}  x1 6 ({x2, x3} + v ). inserting the explicit
expression for w (with the values of the parameters obtained so far) one sees
that this condition is equivalent to

[q, t (w (x2)w (x3))|tree] = divx2 + (x2  x3).

(135)

as we mentioned in section 2 the latter requirement is satised i the masses
agree m  m1 = m2 = m3 (47), the parameters of the h-coupling take the
values (48)50, there is no term : h 4 : in w and if the normalization con-
stants in the tree normalization terms (49) are suitably chosen (up to  (50)
they are uniquely xed by (135)). so far there remain two free parameters
in w and t (w w )|tree: s (41) (cf. (48)) and  (50). in section 2 they have
been determined by

[q, t (w (x1)w (x2)w (x3))|tree] = divx1 + cyclic permutations.

(136)

by inserting (135) into (133) we nd the weaker requirement

[f (x), [q, t (w (x1)w (x2)w (x3))|tree]] = divx1 + cyclic permutations (137)
50in the following calculations the undetermined sign  in (48) is chosen to be  = 1.

55

for x1, x2, x3  (x + v )\{x}. but the latter condition does not determined
s and . one needs to consider the physicality condition (69) to fourth order.
there the values (51) for s and  are obtained, as can be seen by an analogous
procedure. so we obtain exactly the same results for the parameters in
w and the tree normalizations in t (w w ) as in section 2. we recall that
they agree completely with the interaction lagrangian obtained by the higgs
mechanism.

- now we have explained how to handle the essential diculties which
appear in the determination of the parameters in w (41) and in fint (67)
by the physicality (69). we do not give further details. instead we give a
heuristic summary and the remaining results. to n-th order the requirement
(69) reads

0 = [q,f (n)

d (x)] +

n

xl=1

il

l!z dx1...dxl [q, r(w (x1)...w (xl);f (nl)

d  fd.

where f (0)
(i) in the non-local terms (xj 6= x for at least one j) we can apply the
causal factorization (4) of the time ordered products. then the non-local
terms in (138) cancel due to

[q, t (w (x1)...w (xk))] = sum of divergences of local operators,

1  k  n,
(139)

and the physicality (138) to lower orders < n (see e.g. (128-129)). we have
seen that for the tree diagrams to lowest orders the condition (139) is not only
sucient for the cancelation, it is also necessary. but the lowest orders tree
diagrams of (139) x the parameters in w and t (w w )|tree, as was shown
in [2].
for the cancelation of the non-local terms in (138) it is not important
which kind of physical elds we require to exist, the properties (i)-(vi) of
fint (67) are essentially not needed. hence we conjecture that already the
existence of any non-trivial observable xes the interaction.
(ii) the cancelation of the remaining terms in (138), which are local
their support is the total diagonal xj = x, j), requires a suitable
(x)) (see
, l = 0, 1, ..., n 

(i.e.
normalization of the time ordered products t (w (x1)...w (xl);f (nl)
e.g. (118)) and a suitable choice of the parameters in f (nl)

1.51 in this way the latter parameters are uniquely determined (at least to
lowest orders).

so the cancelation of the local terms to second order requires

t(2) = 0,

t(2) = 0,

v(2)

x(2) = 0,

y(2) = 0,

z(2) = 0,

z(1) = 0.(140)

the very last equation results from the terms  g2 : f (x)u(x)h 2(x) :. in
this case the cancelation is of a special kind as explained below. the other
equations are obtained analogously to (106), (119). they come from bilinear
and trilinear terms. x(1), x(2) and z(2) are still arbitrary.

to third order the terms  g3 : f (x)u(x)(x)(x) :, ( g3 : f (x)u(x)h 2(x) :

summing up (119), (140) and (141) we obtain the result (70). but we
have not checked that the cancelation of the local terms in (138) can be
achieved for loop diagrams and for tree diagrams to higher orders. for the
tree diagrams with more than three external legs (e.g. the very last equation
in (140) and the terms considered in (141)) there is no contribution from
f (n)

are available only (besides normalization constants). however, most of the
latter parameters have already been xed (or restricted) by (138) to lower
orders. (for example to achieve the cancelation of the terms considered in
(141), it is important that x(1) (z(2) resp.) has not been xed previously.) so
we have shown the existence of observables f 
d int, d = 1, 2, 3, only partially.
but there is a strong hint that this holds true for all terms to all orders from
the identication (given in the main text) of our physical elds f 
d int (70) as
gauge invariant elds in the framework of spontaneous symmetry breaking
of the su(2) gauge symmetry.
51mainly parameters in f (n)
