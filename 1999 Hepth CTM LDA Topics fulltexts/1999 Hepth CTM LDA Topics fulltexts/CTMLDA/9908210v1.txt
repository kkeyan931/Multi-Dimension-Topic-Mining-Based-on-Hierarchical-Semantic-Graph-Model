1. introduction.

it is formally possible to generalize any non-abelian eld theory by replacing its lie
group by the corresponding quantum group. since the lie algebras are completely rigid
with respect to small deformations of the structure constants, it is clear that any new
theory obtained in this way must be very dierent from the corresponding lie theory and
in particular it will contain additional degrees of freedom. while conventional yang-mills
theories may describe internal properties of point particles such as isotopic spin they do
not describe extension, i.e. solitonic or stringy properties of an elementary particle. the
quantum gauge theories may be able to do this1 and at the same time are approximated by
a yang-mills theory in a correspondence limit. here we pursue the correspondence further
by considering spontaneous symmetry breaking.

2. the q-yang-mills theory.

the basic lagrangian may be expressed as follows:1

s = z d4x(cid:26)

qf f  qr + itc +

1

2(cid:2)()t() + t(cid:3)(cid:27)

where kinetic terms in q and qr have been omitted. here

and

derivative transforms as

a =   

a

the eld strength is dened by

and transforms as

f

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

the fundamental new assumption is that the gauge group is slq(2). then if t belongs to
slq(2)

t tt = t t t = 

where t means transpose and

 is analogous to the charge conjugation matrix c intertwining the lorentz transformations

which depends on

(2.14)

but (2.14) will be satised in general only if the matrix elements of t1 commute with those
of t2. to ensure this property one may take t1 and t2 at spatially (causally) separated
points with respect to the light cone. the resulting groupoid is therefore non-local.

we shall discuss the action (2.1) as the basis for a non-abelian gauge theory. the
treatment will dier from the conventional lie theories since the interacting elds in (2.1)
are operator valued even before quantization and it is necessary to introduce not only the
usual fock space but also a second state space. to describe the theory more completely one
must assign quantum group representations to the constituent elds. finally in order to
compare with conventional theories we shall add a symmetry breaking term that becomes
important only near the minimum in the eld energy.

3. the quantum groups slq(2), suq(2), and soq(2).

set

t = (cid:18) a b

d(cid:19) ,

c

t slq(2) .

then eqs. (2.9) require that the matrix elements of t satisfy the following relations

(a) ab = qba
(b) ac = qca

(d) cd = qdc
(e) bd = qdb

(c) bc = cb

(f) ad  qbc = 1
(g) ad  da = (q  q1)bc

q1 = q1

where q may be complex.

a quantum subgroup is obtained by setting

(3.1)

(3.2)

then

(a) ab = qba
(b) ab = qba
(c) bb = bb

d = a
c = q1b .

(d) ba = qab
(e) ba = qab

3

(f) aa + bb = 1
(g) aa + q2

bb = 1

1

(3.3a)

(3.3b)

(3.4)

note that (3.4) is invariant under involution only if

q = q .

(3.5)

in the hermitian case, q = q (= complex conjugate) and by (3.5) q must be real. the
corresponding quantum group is suq(2) or t 1 = (t t).

if, however, a = at, b = bt, and q = qt, where t means simple transposition, and if
q is a scalar matrix, then q = qt = q where q may be complex. then (3.4) and (3.5) are
satised and the corresponding quantum group is soq(2) or t 1 = t t.

4. representations of the suq(2) and the soq(2) algebras.

a matrix representatiion of the algebra should be understood in the following discus-

sion.

(a) hermitian involution (suq(2)).

let

t = (cid:18) 
q1 



(cid:19)

(4.1)

then permitting the operation of hermitian conjugation with real q we may abbreviate
(3.4) as follows:

 = q
  = q 
  = 

  +   = 1
 + q2
q1 = q1

1

 = 1

(4.2)

(4.6)
(4.7)

if q = 1, the equations (4.2) may be satised by complex numbers  and  subject to

if q = 1, (4.2) may be satised by

||2 + ||2 = 1 .

 =  =

 =  =

1 0(cid:19) = 1

1

2 (cid:18) 0 1
2 (cid:18) 0 i

1

i

0 (cid:19) = 2 .

(4.3)

(4.4)

in addition to these nite representations there is
in both cases, q = 1, t su (2).
an innite dimensional representation. to derive this representation let us introduce the
innite dimensional state space associated with the algebra (4.2).

denote the basis states by |ni, n = 0, 1, 2 . . .. since  and  commute we may require
(4.5)

|0i = 0
|0i = b|0i
|0i = b|0i ,

4

where b amd b are complex conjugates. then the remaining states are obtained with the
aid of the raising operator  by

it is also consistent to set

|ni = n|n + 1i .

|ni = n|n  1i .

then the quadratic relations determine n and n as follows:

one also nds

|n| = (1  |b|2q2n)
n = n1

1

2

|ni = qnb|ni
|ni = qnb|ni
|b|2 = q2 > 0  q is real .

(4.8)

(4.9)

(4.10)

(4.11)

(4.12)

(4.13)
(4.14)

eq. (4.10) implies negative norms unless q2  1. the |ni are eigenstates of the self-adjoint
operator

h =

(  + )

(4.15)

1
2

and are hence orthogonal.

the preceding operator representation may be displayed as an innite matrix repre-

sentation in the usual way:

hn||ni = n(n, n  1)
hn| |ni = n(n, n + 1)
hn||ni = qnb(n, n)
hn| |ni = qnb(n, n)

(4.16)

(4.17)
(4.18)
(4.19)

where n and n are given by (4.10) and (4.11). by restricting the action to a nite
subspace of the state space one may search for nite dimensional representations. the
3-dimensional representation illustrates the general case.

but q must be real, therefore

q = 1 .

(4.22)

(4.23)

there are no additional nite-dimensional representations to be obtained in this way.

(b) transposition involution (soq(2)).

the matrix equations (3.3) and (3.4) and (4.2) may be read slightly dierently by
substituting simple transposition for hermitian conjugation. then the equations (4.2)
retain their same form but now

 = t
 = t = 
q = qt = q

(4.24)

and q may be complex.

the equations describing the state space are also the same except for changes required

by (4.24). for example

 |0i = b2|0i

b2 = q2

instead of
instead of

 |0i = |b|2|0i
|b|2 = q2

the principal equations now read as follows:

where

|0i = 0
|0i = b|0i
|0i = b|0i
|ni = n|n + 1i
|ni = n|n  1i ,

n = (1  q2n+2)
n = n1 .

hn||ni = n(n, n  1)
hn| |ni = n(n, n + 1)
hn||ni = qn+1(n, n)

(4.25)

(4.26)

(4.27)

eqs. (4.20) and (4.21) for the 3-dimensional representation are also unchanged except that
 = t and q may now be complex.

since the complex roots of unity are now allowed, there is now an innite class of

nite-dimensional representations. in the n -dimensional representation

2 (cid:21) = i

(4.28)

(4.29)

(4.30)

there is the following correspondence between the q-algebra and the conventional

notation for the cartan subalgebra in both cases (a) and (b):

  e+

(4.31)

5. a dierent reduction of the state space of slq(2).

by not making the second assumption (3.3b) one obtains a less restrictive state space.
eqs.

(3.2) may be rewritten to bring out the following algebraic automorphism:

  , q  q1.

 = q

 = q

 = q1

 = q1

  q = 1
  q1 = 1

 = 

(5.1)

since  and  commute they have a common set of eigenstates. let the ground state, |0i,
be dened by

|0i = 0
|0i = bo|0i
|0i = co|0i .

dene the state |ni by the recursive relations:

|ni = n|n + 1i
|ni = n|n  1i

7

(5.2)

(5.3)

then by (5.1)

|ni = qnbo|ni
|ni = qnco|ni .

the algebraic symmetry may be used to dene the dual states according to

we also assume

then by (4.1)

set

h0| = 0
hn| = hn + 1|n
hn| = hn  1|n .

h0| = h0|bo
h0| = h0|co

hn| = hn|qnbo
hn| = hn|qnco

(5.4)

(5.5)

(5.6)

(5.7)

(5.8)

where the bar means either (a) hermitian or (b) transposition conjugation.

we discuss (a) rst. then the dual equations (5.5)-(5.7) are also hermitian conjugates

of (5.2)-(5.4) if q and the other numerical factors are all real as we shall assume.

we also have by (5.1)

  q1 = 1
   q = 1

(5.9a)

(5.9b)

under the algebraic automorphism (5.9a)  (5.9b) and under hermitian conjugation, these
equations go into themselves.

we may compute

hn| |ni = hn|n|n + 1i = nn+1hn|ni = nn+1

and also by (5.3), (5.5) and (5.8)

hn| |ni = hn|  |ni = |n|2hn + 1|n + 1i = |n|2 .

where we have set hn|ni = 1 for all n. then

by (5.9a)


n = n+1 .

boco = q .

by (5.12).

hn|   q|ni = 1

|n|2  q q2nboco = 1 .

|n|2 = 1 + q2n+2
|n|2 = 1 + q2n

(5.14)
(5.15)

in case (b) the bar in (5.8) and following equations means transposition conjugation.
the dual state equations are also transposition conjugate. then q and other numerical
factors are not constrained to be real. the scalar products, measured by 2
n rather than
|n|2, may still be chosen positive for a proper choice of q:

n = 1 + q2n+1 .
2

(5.16)

in reductions of slq(2) to suq(2) and soq(2) we have assumed (3.3b). in that case
one must also assume q2  1 according to (4.10) and (4.27), but we are now assuming
that  and  are separately hermitian (symmetric) rather than hermitian (symmetric)
conjugates and q may therefore be greater than unity by (5.14) and (5.16).

in terms of t the equation (5.8) means

t 1t 1 = 1

where

1 = (cid:18) 0 1

1 0(cid:19) and t = (cid:18)  

 (cid:19) .



(5.17)

(5.18)

6. the choice of gauge.

since the theory is t -invariant, all elds may lie in the algebra (3.2). every t -
transformation will introduce new powers of the generators (, , , ). the theory may
be completed by introducing a privileged gauge that breaks the t -invariance. in the higgs
model the symmetry breaking is accomplished by associating the privileged gauge with
the minimum in the eld energy. one may imagine a similar mechanism here.
in any
case we would like the q-theory to lie close enough to the lie theory to permit a plausible
correspondence limit. in the lie case (su (2)) the vector and neutral scalar elds may be
written

w = w +

  + w 
 = 33 + 01 .

 + + w 3

 3

(6.1)

(6.2)

9

to go over from the lie algebra to the q-algebra we adopt the correspondence (4.31)

and write

w = w +

  + w 
 

 =  + 

  + w 


  + w




(6.3)

(6.4)

since the diagonal elements correspond to (, ).

in the suq(2) theory q is real q2  1, and (, , , ) are regarded as operators
on the innite dimensional internal state space. then there are 4 kinds of w particles:
, and there are 2 kinds of  particles:  and  ; and each of these
w +, w , w , and w
carries an innite set of excited states labelled by the eigenvalue of .

in the soq(2) theory the transition from slq(2) to a subgroup is accomplished with
the aid of the transposition involution (which is the more economical choice since slq(2)
is itself dened in terms of a transposition). in this case, q is an n th root of unity. then
 =  and each of the 4 particles (w +, w , w , ) carries a nite set of excited states
(of height n since the eigenvalues of  will run from q to qn ).

one next has the option of regarding q (a) as a basic parameter of the second theory
or (b) as a new quantum number that will be dierent for the dierent particle multiplets.
with option (b) one would be able to include the q = 1 particles, the familiar su (2)
particles. in this case we may regard q as an operator commuting with the rest of the
algebra and equal to the product of a hermitian and a unitary matrix so that its eigenvalues
may be either real or roots of unity, depending on the state on which it operates. in this
way one would arrive at a more general formalism that would subsume the separate cases
already mentioned. the enlarged state space is then divided into disjoint sectors labelled
by the eigenvalues of q. since q commutes with the complete algebra, transitions between
the separate sectors are not possible within the algebra.

in the slq(2) case  and  are separately hermitian rather than hermitian conjugates.
there are again 4 kinds of vector particles but there are no nite representations. the
important distinction is now that q2  1 no longer holds.

7. vector masses for suq(2) and soq(2).

following the usual ideas about spontaneous symmetry breaking, we may assume
a neutral scalar eld, a functional potential leading to a non-invariant lowest state, the
existence of goldstone bosons if the symmetry is global, and the replacement of goldstone
bosons by massive vectors if the symmetry is position-dependent. we shall accordingly
add to the original lagrangian a symmetry breaking term that becomes important near
the minimum in the eld energy and couples a neutral scalar eld to the vector eld.

the interaction term is assumed to be invariant under su (2) only, while the interact-
ing elds continue to lie in the suq(2) or the soq(2) algebra. then the vector mass term
is buried in the following kinetic energy term:

()()

(7.1)

where the dagger indicates hermitian conjugation. here  is the covariant derivative:

 =  + w(+) + w()  + w

we discuss only case (a). then  and  are separately hermitian rather than hermitian
conjugates and q is real but otherwise unrestricted. we repeat the calculation of mass for
this case.

dropping the vector index one has

 =  + c + n

c = w (+) + w () 
n = w + w
 =  +  .

the mass terms are

hn|(cid:2)(c + n )(cid:3)(cid:2)(c + n )(cid:3)|ni = hn|(c c + n n )|ni

by (8.2) n contains a -eld and also a -eld; but since the eigenvalues of  and  are
proportional by (5.4), one of these elds is redundant and permits the replacement of w
and w by z in eq. (8.9).

there is always enough information in the lowest lying multiplet to x q. if q should
turn out to be real and exceed unity in the case of other higher vector multiplets, then the
formalism would suggest a phenomenological theory predicting the manner in which the
low-lying pattern would be replicated at higher energies.

9. summary.

we have discussed a formal extension of non-abelian eld theory with the following
properties: the symmetry group is non-local; the dynamical elds do not lie in a lie algebra.
as a consequence, when the elds are resolved in normal modes, it is necessary to expand
state space in order to make a particle interpretation. it has been shown earlier1 for free
scalar elds that the particles associated with the expanded state space are characterized
by a string-like spectrum.

if q is real, the slq(2) group is collapsed to the suq(2) group; if q is a root of unity
slq(2) is collapsed to soq(2). if q is a root of unity, the particle multiplets are nite-
dimensional; but if q is real, only an innite-dimensional multiplet is allowed. in order to
accommodate both kinds of multiplets, it is necessary that total state space be divided
into disjoint sectors corresponding to dierent values of q. transition btween sectors can
be mediated by additional interactions lying outside the q-algebra. in both the suq(2)
and soq(2) examples q2  1. to obtain the possibility of q > 1 and real one may utilize
slq(2) with t 1 = 1t .
the principal novelty of this approach lies in the alternative that it provides for
introducing into eld theory non-locality and solitonic particles in an algebraic rather
than a geometric framework such as proposed in stringlike or other higher dimensional
theories.
