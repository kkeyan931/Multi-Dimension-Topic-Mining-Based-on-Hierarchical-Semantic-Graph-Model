(1) 1 expression (1) fact easily seen integer use stokes theorem . taking eld theory point view, linking number (1, 2) may obtained introducing topological abelian chern simons action  scs(a) = 1 2z d3xaa , (2) evaluating correlation function two loop variables h dxa, i..e., (cid:28)i1 dxai2 dya(cid:29)scs . (3) expression (3) reproduces linking number follows obser- vation propagator gauge eld obtained chern simons action (2) upon quantization landau gauge precisely kernel gauss integral (1), i.e., ha(x)a(y)iscs = 1 4 (x y) |x y|3 . (4) correlator (3) may thus regarded eld-theory description linking (1, 2). action (2) suitably extended higher dimensions, providing eld-theory characterization generalizations linking number . moreover, nonabelian version three- dimensional chernsimons action (2) proven play relevant role knot theory . although topological eld theories possess interests applications, worth underlining topological terms appear fre- quently parts general eective actions useful theoretical description large number phenomena dierent space-time dimen- sions. instance, eective action corresponding bosonization  relativistic three-dimensional massive fermionic systems = 0 written sum chern-simons term (2) innite series higher-order terms curvature f derivatives, i.e., s(f ) combination terms type scs(a) + s(f ), z d3xf 2, z d3xf 4, z d3xf 6, . . . 2 (5) (6) kind action turns useful order study several three- dimensional phenomena fermibose transmutation  quantum hall eect . second interesting example provided ve-dimensional gener- alization (5), obtained ads/cft correspondence , relates conformal n = 4 super-yang-mills theory type-iib superstring ads5 s5. fact, conformal case, dual supergravity ads5 possesses chernsimons term obtained sl(2, z) doublet two- forms brr , bn looks like {$9812012$} . case, relevant eective action brr , bn d5xbrr bn + s(db) , (7) zads5 term s(db) collects higher-order terms curvatures dbrr, dbn s. correlation function (3) generalizes (cid:28)z1 dbrr z2 dbn (cid:29) , (8) 1, 2 appropriate two-surfaces. view applications, seems natural ask response correlator type (3) corresponding topological eld theory perturbed introduction nontopological interaction term depending curvature. aim present paper. precisely, shall report four-loop computation correlator (cid:28)i1 dxai2 dya(cid:29)se , (9) three-dimensional chernsimons action (2) perturbed non- topological interaction term kind r f 4, namely, expression (9) evaluated eective action se given se = 1 2z d3xa + 4!z d3xef efef ef , (10) ef = 1 2 f arbitrary parameter negative mass dimension, reecting power-counting nonrenormalizability pertur- bation. 3 particular, shall able prove correlation function (9) turns independent , yielding linking number (1, 2) two curves 1, 2. although loop analysis worked fourth order, conclusion holds orders perturbation theory may easily generalized local nontopological interaction term containing arbitrary powers curvature f well higher- dimensional cases  as, instance, eective action eq.(7). result means loop correlator (9) stable respect perturbations added starting topological action. words, expression (9) give linking number two curves 1, 2, regardless f -dependent perturbation term introduced power-counting nonrenormalizability character. two remarks order. first, limit eective actions abelian. second, shall consider f -

(15) figure 2: two-loop contribution gure, wavy dashed lines refer respectively wick contractions daefe def efe. feynman integrals corresponding diagram fig.2 easily written means eqs.(14), (15). however, computing them, let us spend words mechanism responsible independence parameter expression (9). structure diagram fig.2, observe gauge elds a(x) a(y) present interaction term expression (12). therefore, besides lying two curves 1 2will always contracted ef contractions type def efe, corresponding feynman integrals always contain two contractions kind daefe. however, one remark second term eq.(14) one lorentz indices two space-time derivatives corresponds vector index gauge eld 6 lying either 1 2. thus refers total derivative respect variable running along one closed loops, implying vanishing contribution. words, second term eq.(14) may neglected. consequence, wick contractions entering feynman integrals basically lead product delta functions. introduction suitable regularization, latter integrated out, nally resulting 3(x y), where, remind, x run along two curves, respectively. variables never coincide, whole expression vanishes identically, ensuring independence parameter correlator (9). mechanism seen occur higher loop orders, explicitly shown later on. apart irrelevant global symmetry coecient, diagram fig.2 therefore corresponds following integral: (2) = i1 dxi2 dyz d3z1 d3z2 da(x) f(z1)eda(y) f(z2)ed f(z1) f(z2)e h4d f (z1) f (z2)ed f (z1) f (z2)e + 2d f (z1) f (z2)ed f (z1) f (z2)ei . (16) let us analyse rst term expression. making use propagators (14) (15), obtain dxi2 dyz d3z1 d3z2 4i1 (cid:20)g3(x z1) + 4 |x z1|(cid:21)(cid:20)g3(y z2) + (cid:2)3(z1 z2)(cid:3)(cid:2) 3(z1 z2)(cid:3)(cid:2)3(z1 z2)(cid:3) . 1 1 4 |y z2|(cid:21) (17) previously mentioned, terms containing derivatives contribute, correspond total derivatives closed curves. expression (17) becomes dxi2 4i1 (cid:2)3(z1 z2)(cid:3)(cid:2) dyz d3z1 d3z2 3(x z1)3(y z2) 3(z1 z2)(cid:3)(cid:2) 3(z1 z2)(cid:3) .(18) spite presence products delta functions argu- ments, expression easily seen vanish. let us show claim 7 two ways. first, observe always possible order taking integrations delta functions end products 3(x y) 3(0). present case, would amount integrate rst two delta functions arguments x z1 z2, would lead 4i1 dxi2 dy(cid:2)3(x y)(cid:3)(cid:2) 3(x y)(cid:3)(cid:2) 3(x y)(cid:3) = 0 , (19) since x never vanishes. worth remarking possibility exists, fact, higher-order diagrams, shown below. second, adopt rigorous treatment regularizing delta functions coinciding arguments point-splitting procedure already used polyakov : (z1 z2) = 1 (2)3/2 e(z1z2)2/2 , (z1 z2) = 3(z1 z2) . lim 0 (20) precisely, whenever product n delta functions coinciding ar- guments occurs, understood limit 0 meant taken end calculations. accordingly, expression (18) replaced regularized version, (cid:2)3(z1 z2)(cid:3)n = n1 3(z1 z2) , dxi2 dy 3(x z1)3(y z2) lim 0 4i1 (cid:2)(z1 z2)(cid:3) (cid:2) 3(z1 z2)(cid:3) . (21) whatever order integration, get, taking limit, expres- sion containing 3(x y), leads null result. second term (16) follows analogously, two-loop diagram fig.2 contribute correlator (9). concerning higher-order contributions perturbation theory, results similar nature. topologically distinct diagrams contribut- ing 3- 4-loop given fig.3 figs.4 5. 8 figure 3: three-loop contribution figure 4: four-loop contribution, rst type 9 figure 5: four-loop contribution, second type sucient present one typical term order. notational simplication convenient. dene transverse derivative operator . instance, typical contraction fig.3 proportional (3) = i1 = i1 dyz d3z1 d3z2d3z3 g3(x z1)g3(y z2) dxi2 h 3(z1 z2)ih 3(z1 z3)ih 3(z1 z3)i h 3(z2 z3)ih 3(z2 z3)i dyz d3z3h 3(x y)i dxi2 h (x z3)ih 3(x z3)ih (y z3)ih 3(y z3)i , (22) diagram fig.4 gives (4) = i1 dxi2 dyz d3z1 d3z4 g3(x z1)g3(y z2) 10 h 3(z1 z2)ih 3(z1 z3)ih 3(z1 z4)i h 3(z2 z4)ih 3(z2 z3)ih 3(z3 z4)i h 3(z3 z4)i dxi2 h 3(x z3)ih 3(x z4)ih 3(y z4)i h 3(y z3)ih (z3 z4)ih 3(z3 z4)i . dyz d3z3 d3z4 h 3(x y)i = i1 (23) order obtain expressions followed prescrip- tion established regularizing delta functions identical ar- guments. notice also integrated rst two -functions whose arguments depend points x two curves. terms possible diagrams may seen proportional 3(xy) (or derivatives). one may easily convince oneself mech- anism also applies order perturbation theory. always x 6= y, diagrams amount null correction basic diagram, correlation function (9) two closed smooth nonintersecting curves 1, 2 gives linking number orders: ha(x)a(y)ise = (1, 2).
