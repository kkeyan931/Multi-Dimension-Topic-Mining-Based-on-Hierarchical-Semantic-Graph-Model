abstract: we construct a covariant bound on the energy-momentum of the m-
vebrane which is saturated by all supersymmetric congurations. this leads to a
generalised notion of a calibrated geometry for m-vebranes when the worldvolume
gauge eld is non-zero. the generalisation relevant for dp-branes is also given.

introduction

supersymmetric soliton solutions have been at the centre of a great deal of study. in general these
solitons are stable due to their saturation of a topological bound which is a consequence of the
existence of preserved supersymmetries and an exact force cancellation between the various elds.
in the case of a non-abelian monopole for example, the bogomolnyi condition relates the scalar
higgs eld to the magnetic eld. the quantum corrections to these states are also under greater
control and therefore their properties can often be deduced in the complete quantum theory.

in recent years the focus in string theory has moved to branes where m-theory provides an
elegant and unifying framework. m-theory possess just two branes in at spacetime and the m-
vebrane is particularly interesting since it has a gauge eld on its worldvolume. in contrast to
other branes, this gauge eld is a self-dual two-form. the various dp-branes and the ns-vebrane
in ten-dimensional ii string theory are related to the m-vebrane by dimensional reduction and
t-duality.

the scalar elds that occur in the low energy dynamics describe the way a brane is embedded
in spacetime and as a consequence the corresponding bogomolnyi conditions will determine the
geometry of this embedding. in studies of brane solitons in the absence of a gauge elds it has
been found that the resulting geometries have an elegant interpretation as calibrated manifolds
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

this has led to a search for a generalised notion of calibrations to include solitons with active
worldvolume gauge elds [6]. in [7, 8] the notion of a calibration was extended to cases where there
is a background spacetime gauge eld. in this paper we will use the covariant superembedding
approach to construct a general bogomolnyi bound on the energy-momentum of an m-vebrane.
this bound naturally suggests a generalised denition of a calibration for cases when the world-
volume gauge eld is present. finally we mention how this bound can be dimensionally reduced
to the worldvolume of a dp-brane.

2 an energy-momentum bound

an m-vebrane is described by its embedding coordinates x n, n = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10, and ,  =
1, 2, 3, ..., 32, as well as a two-form gauge eld bmn, m, n = 0, 1, 2, ..., 5, with eld strength h = db
which lives on its six-dimensional worldvolume.
in static gauge one identies the worldvolume
coordinates with the rst six coordinates of spacetime and sets half of the fermions to zero. this
leaves ve scalar modes x n
, n = 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, describing the transverse coordinates and sixteen
fermions  i
 . these are u sp(4) symplectic majorana-weyl spinors with  = 1, 2, 3, 4, i = 1, 2, 3, 4.
in what follows we will omit the spinor indices for simplicity.

in the superembedding formalism the residual supersymmetry transformation after setting half

of the fermions to zero takes the form [4, 6]

where 2 = 1. we can therefore dene a projector p  1
2 (1  ) whose kernel consists of the
preserved supersymmetries of a given bosonic eld conguration. out of (1) one can construct a
manifestly positive denite object

 = (1  ),

(1)

||(1  )||2 = (1  )(1  )  0,

(2)

which on physical grounds is expected to lead to a bound on the energy involving the central
charges of the vebrane supersymmetry algebra.

evaluating the bound of (2) one nds that the energy does not naturally occur unless hmnp = 0.
as such it is dicult to interpret the bound arising from the variation of the fermion of equation (1).
a way out of this dilemma is to recognise that (2) contains a hidden ambiguity; the  arise as half
of the grassmann coordinates of the background superspace and since these are merely coordinates,
we are free to make another choice. the new fermions will have a dierent supervariation and
therefore lead to a new bound.

we start by performing a eld redenition

for some invertible, eld dependent matrix m . the new fermions  will transform as

 = m ,

 = m +  = (1  )m +  ,

(3)

(4)

where the ellipses denote terms which vanish after we set the fermions to zero. from (2) we are
led to the positive quantity

||(1  )m||2 = (1  )m m(1  )  0 .

(5)

our aim is now to nd a matrix m such that (5) does give a natural bound on the energy for
a generic vebrane conguration. from this new bound we will be able to derive a notion of a
generalised calibration which holds in the presence of worldvolume gauge elds.

we now turn to the technical task of determining the matrix m and the exact form of the
resulting bound. first let us describe in more detail the m-vebrane dynamics [11]. these were
derived from the superembeding formalism when applied to the m-vebrane [12]. the physical
three-form eld is h, which is closed. however, it is constrained to satisfy a non-linear self-duality
condition. to describe this condition it is helpful to introduce a three-form habc which is self-dual

habc =

1
3!

abcdef hdef ,

(6)

where we used tangent frame indices a, b, . . .. these are related to the world indices m, n, . . ., by
the usual vielbein e a

m constructed from the induced metric which in static gauge is given by

gmn = mn + mx a

nx b

ab .

later we will need the explicit connection associated with this metric which is given by

mn

p = mnx a

qx b

gqpab .

(7)

(8)

self-duality implies that the only covariant tensors one can construct out of h are given by

cdhbcd,
dhdbc,

kab  ha
(kh)abc  ka
q  1 

2
3

kabkab,

since (k2) b

a = 1

6 (trk2) b

a . one then denes the physical (closed) three-form eld habc as

habc 

1
q

(habc + 2(kh)abc) .

the self-duality condition on habc now implies that (kh)abc is anti-self-dual resulting in

 h abc 

1
3!

abcdef hdef =

1
q

(habc  2(kh)abc).

with these denitions the energy-momentum can be written as [9]

t 0a =

2  q

q

and in particular the energy is, for a static conguration, given by

e =

q

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

which agrees with the action formulation [10].

the worldvolume -matrices are the pull-backs of the at eleven-dimensional -matrices and

in static gauge are given as

m = mx n n = m

n n + mx n n .

(14)

but for our calculation it will be more convenient to use these -matrices referred to tangent frame
a = e m
a m; here they obey the standard property {a, b} = 2ab and as a consequence also the
duality relation

a1...an =

1

(6  n)!

n(n+1)

2

(1)

a1...anan+1...a6 012345an+1...a6 .

we may now write the matrix  that appears in the supersymmetry projector p (1) as [11]

 = (0) + (h)  

1
6!

abcdef abcdef +

habcabc .

(15)

(16)

furthermore, the m-vebrane itself preserves supersymmetries such that (1  012345) = 0.
elds of the m-vebrane is given by

returning to the matrix m , the most general covariant form that can be constructed from the

m  a + b(0) + c(h) + d(kh),

(17)

where (kh)  1
3 (kh)abcabc and a, b, c and d are functions of q which are to be determined. to
proceed we need the basic matrices in a more explicit way. using self-duality of h, anti-self-duality
of (kh) and the duality relation for the -matrices one nds

(0) = 012345,
(h) = h0ij0ij (1 + 012345),
(kh) = (kh)0ij0ij (1  012345),

(18)

here i, j, . . . denote tangent indices running from 1 to 5. we need three additional identities

(h0ij0ij )2 = 2(k00 + ki

00123450i),

((kh)0ij 0ij )2 =

h0ij0ij (kh)0kl0kl =

(19)

(1  )m = (a  b)(1  h0ij 0ij)(1 + 012345) + d(2(kh)0ij 0ij + 1  q)(1  012345).

(20)

we are only concerned with static congurations which implies

(012345) = 012345

and

(0ij ) = 0ij.

(21)

furthermore one has {0ij, 012345} = 0. hence we nd the conjugate of (20) to be

m(1  ) = (a  b)(1 + 012345)(1  h0ijh0ij ) + d(1  012345)(2(kh)0ij 0ij + 1  q).

(22)

evaluating the product and sorting the resulting terms gives

+2(a  b)2(2h0ij0ij) + 2d2(1  q)4(kh)0ij 0ij.

00i)012345

(23)

making the choice d2 = 1

1q (a  b)2 leads to

(1  )m m(1  ) = 2(a  b)2q(e  0iti

0  0  2 h 0ij0ij ),

(24)

where we have identied the components of the energy-momentum tensor (12). so for this choice
of constants we obtain the following bound on the energy

(e  0iti

0)  ((0) + 2 h 0ij0ij ) ,

(25)

which is the same as found in [6] if we identify ti = pi. it is gratifying to see that the three-form
automatically appears in the guise of the dual of the physical eld habc. note that the left hand
side of (25) is simply

mpm ,

(26)

where  = 0 and pm = t 0
leads to a manifestly covariant form for the bound in terms of the noether charges.

m is the six-momentum density. spatial integration of equation (25)

in an earlier work [9] we found that the associated energy momentum tensor is covariantly

conserved

mt mn = 0.

we are now going to show that this tensor gives rise to a tensor density

t mn = gt mn,

which is conserved in the at space sense

m t mn = 0.

(27)

(28)

(29)

thus the total energy and momentum of the m-vebrane are indeed conserved quantities.

the equation of motion for the scalar elds of the vebrane in static gauge and for a at

background is given by [11]

here gmn = qt mn [9] so this can be rewritten as

gmnmmx a

= 0.

t mnmnx a

= m(t mnnx a

) = 0,

(30)

(31)

where we used the fact that t mn is covariantly conserved. using standard tensor analysis we nd
that the equation of motion can be written as

m(gt mnnx a

) =

1

g

m(gt mn)nx a

1

g

+ t mnmnx a

= 0.

(32)

hence to prove our initial statement we have to show that the second term vanishes. this is
equivalent to showing that the equation of motion implies gmnmnx a
= 0. starting from (30)
we calculate

gmnmnx a

= gmnmnx a
= gmnmnx a
= gmnmnx b
= gmnmnx b

 gmnmn
 gmnmnx b

a short calculation reveals that the inverse of the matrix mb

exists and is given by

thus it follows that gmnmnx a
squares to a multiple of itself

b

= 0 if and only if gmnmnx a

= 0.

returning to the bound it turns out that for any choice of a, b, c and d, the matrix (1  )m

((1  )m )2 = 2(a  b + d(1  q))(1  )m.

(35)

hence the variation of the new fermions under worldvolume supersymmetry can be rewritten in
the form

(33)

(34)

(36)

(37)

(38)

 = p ,

where we dened

2(a  b + d(1  q))
choosing d = 11q (a  b) as before we nd from (20)

p 

(1  )m.

p =

+(cid:16)
1  q

(kh)0ij 0ij +p1  q(cid:17)(1  012345)(cid:19),

2

the remaining constants drop out and we are led to a unique new projector. if we express p in a
more familiar way we nd

2p = 1 

1  1  q
1 + 1  q (cid:18)(0) +

1

1 + 1  q

(h) +

2

1  q(1 + 1  q)

(kh)(cid:19) .

(39)

in principle one can now forget about m and simply take p to be the new supersymmetry projector
associated with the new set of fermions . a short calculation gives two relations fullled by p
and p

pp = p, pp = p.

(40)

these relations imply that p and p have the same zero modes, recall that they act from the
right, and that the image of one is related by an invertible, linear transformation to the image of the
other. therefore the bogomolnyi conditions for the preservation of supersymmetry are identical.
although a similar equation was obtained in [10] in terms of p and the supersymmetry projector
pp st of the action formulation, it is easily seen that pp st 6= p since the former is hermitian
whereas the latter is not.
in fact it is easy to establish that this is
generically the case for any values of a, b, c, d. a particularly simple choice is to take a = 0, b =
1, c = 0 so that d = (1  q) 1

our nal task is to ensure that m is invertible.

with m 2 = 1.

3 generalised calibrations

in the previous section we showed that there is a bound on the energy-momentum of a static
m-vebrane conguration which is saturated precisely when supersymmetry is preserved. for the
purely scalar case it is know that the right hand side of the bound corresponds to a calibrating form
and that supersymmetric states can be interpreted as an m-vebrane wrapped on a calibrated sub-
manifold of eleven-dimensional spacetime. in this section we would like to nd a similar spacetime
interpretation in terms of a generalised calibration when h 6= 0.
let us restrict our attention to static congurations that have a rest frame where p i = t 0i = 0.
we are also only interested in the spatial section of the m-vebrane worldvolume. let us introduce
the ve-form  and two-form  dened as

 =

1
01...5dx1  ...  dx5 ,
5!
1
012 dx1  dx2 ,
 = 
2

where 1, 2, 3... = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 and we choose to normalise our spinors such that  = 1. these
forms are dened over the entire ten-dimensional space in which the m-vebrane sits. furthermore,
since they are constant, they are closed. the bound on the total energy now can be written as

e  zm

 + h   ,

(42)

where  denotes the pull-back to the spatial part of the m-vebrane worldvolume m . here we see
that the role of  is to pick out preferred three-cycles in the worldvolume over which the ux of h
is measured. note that only the spatial components of h contribute to e.
this very suggestive form for the bound motivates the following denition of a generalised
calibration, valid for an arbitrary background spacetime: a generalised calibration consists of a
closed ve-form , together with a closed two-form  such that, for all submanifolds m with a
three-form h dened on it,

e dvol   + h   ,

(43)

when evaluated on any tangent plane. here dvol is the volume form and e is given by (13). a
particular pair (m, h) consisting of a ve-dimensional submanifold m and a three-form h is then
said to be calibrated by (, ) if the inequality is saturated on all tangent planes of m . clearly
for h = 0 then e = 1 and (43) reduces to the standard denition of a calibrating form. this leads
to the theorem: a calibrated pair (m, h) has minimal energy e with respect to all other pairs
(m, h) such that m  m = n , for some manifold n and h = h on m = m. this is easily
established from the closure of ,  and stokes theorem as in the analogous proof for standard

calibrations

e = zm
= zm
= zm 
= zm 
= zm 

 + h   ,
 +zm
b   ,
 +zm
 +zn
d +zm 
 +zn
 + h    e ,

(b  d)   ,
b   ,

(44)

where we have written b = b + d on m . thus a calibrated pair minimises the energy and
therefore solves the m-vebrane equations of motion.

although the right hand side of (42) seems quite simple the form for e given in equation (13) is
rather complicated. however the this form is necessary for the existence of calibrated m-vebranes
and we therefore suspect that there is a deeper geometrical signicance to e which would be inter-
esting to understand. furthermore the presence of preserved supersymmetries implies the existence
of reduced holonomy in spacetime. however if the preserved supersymmetries and in particular
their bogomolnyi conditions rely on gauge elds, either on the worldvolume or in spacetime, then
the reduced holonomy is not with respect to the levi-civita connection but rather a connection
that sees the relevant gauge structure. it might be interesting to nd a classication of all reduced
holonomies and the geometries that result from the corresponding generalised calibrations.

we may further generalise the notion of a calibration to include the case where d = f 6= 0
as in [7, 8] and also for dh 6= 0. these cases correspond to a non-zero four-form eld strength
g = dc in eleven dimensions. in this case we may write h = db + c where c is the pull-back
of c and dh = g [12]. the above argument is altered to

e  e +zn

(f + g  ) .

(45)

following [7, 8] we may interpret the additional term as the contribution of a wess-zumino term
to the total energy. to see this we observe that the modied bound (45) can be writen as

where

e + w z  e + w z ,

w z = zm

( + c  ) , w z = zm 

( + c  ) ,

(46)

(47)

and  is an static gauge potential dened by d = f .
in practice many soliton solutions of the m-vebrane are r-branes where the scalars and three-
form only depend on q = 5  r of the spatial dimensions. in this case the forms  and  are more
naturally interpreted as a q-form and (q  3)-form respectively
 = 01...r1...q dx1  ...  dxq ,
 = 01...r1...q3 dx1  ...  dxq3 .

(48)

furthermore we are now interested in the energy per unit r-volume and so only the components
of h tangent to the xr+1, ..., x5 dimensions appear in the bound. the denition of a calibration
follows analogously and it is clear that the above theorem still holds for q-dimensional submanifolds
m .

there are already many examples of solitons on the m-vebrane which are supersymmetric with
a non-zero h [13, 6, 14, 15, 16, 17]. these therefore provide examples of generalised calibrations

as dened above. perhaps the simplest example is the self-dual string soliton [13] with q = 4. this
soliton has

h01i =

1
4

ix 6 , hijk =

1
4

ijkllx 6 , x 6 = a +

q
r2

,

(49)

where r2 = xixi, i = 2, 3, 4, 5 and all other elds vanish. the preserved supersymmetries satisfy
016 =  and

 = 01dx  dx  dx  dx ,  = 01dx .

the energy for this conguration is [18]

e dvol = (1 + ix 6ix 6)dx2  dx3  dx4  dx5 ,

whereas the forms  and h   are

 = (cid:0)1  ix 66i(cid:1) dx2  dx3  dx4  dx5 ,

h   = (cid:0)ix 6ix 6 + ix 66i(cid:1) dx2  dx3  dx4  dx5.

(50)

(51)

(52)

from this and the normalisation  = 1 we see that the calibration condition (43) is indeed
saturated.

finally let us describe how this denition of a generalised calibration is modied when we
dimensionally reduce the m-vebrane to d-fourbrane. to this end we consider congurations for
which the x5 direction is an isometry.
it was shown in [11] that the m-vebrane equations of
motion reduce to those of a d-fourbrane (with a dirac-born-infeld action) if the direction x5
is compactied. thus if we consider solitons which do not depend on x5 and write for m, n =
0, 1, 2, 3, 4 [11]

fmn =

1
4

hmn5 ,

then we nd the generalised calibration may be expressed as

e dvol   + f   +  f   ,

(53)

(54)

which now includes contributions from both electric and magnetic charges. here  is the hodge
dual on the d-fourbrane,  = 05dx and [19]

.

(55)

f =

(1  1

2 trf 2)f + f 3
pdet(1 + f )

here f appears with one raised and one lowered index and matrix multiplication is understood.

in terms of the d-fourbrane elds we may write e = pdet(1 + f )(g + f )00, where (g + f )mn
is the matrix inverse of gmn + fmn. it follows from the dirac-born-infeld equation of motion that
d  f = 0, as we expect. the generalisation to all dp-branes with a dirac-born-infeld eective
action is clear. equation (54) stills applies but now the generalised calibration depends on a p-form
, (p  2)-form  and a one-form . in all these cases an analogous theorem exists for a bound on
the energy.
