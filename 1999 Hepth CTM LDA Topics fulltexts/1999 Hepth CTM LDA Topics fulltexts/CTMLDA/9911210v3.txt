null branes in string theory backgrounds

p. bozhilov 1,

bogoliubov laboratory of theoretical physics,

jinr, 141980 dubna, russia

we consider null bosonic p-branes moving in curved space-times and develop a method

for solving their equations of motion and constraints, which is suitable for string theory

backgrounds. as an application, we give an exact solution for such background in ten

dimensions.

1 introduction

the null p-branes are the zero tension limit tp  0 of the usual p-branes, the
1-brane being a string. this relationship between them generalizes the correspondence

between massless and massive particles. thus, the tensionless branes may be viewed

as a high energy limit of the tensile ones.

the p-branes are characterized by an energy scale t 1/(p+1)

p

and therefore by a length

scale t 1/(p+1)

p

. the gravitational eld provides another length scale, the curvature

radius of the space-time rc. for a p-brane moving in a gravitational eld an appropriate

p

parameter is the dimensionless constant d = rct 1/(p+1)
. large values of d imply weak
gravitational eld. one may reach such values of d by letting tp  . in the opposite
limit, small values of d, one encounters strong gravitational elds and it is appropriate
to consider tp  0, i.e. null or tensionless branes.

a lagrangian which could describe under certain conditions null bosonic branes

in d-dimensional minkowski space-time was rst proposed in [1]. an action for a

tensionless p-brane with space-time supersymmetry was rst given in [2]. since then,

other types of actions and hamiltonians (with and without supersymmetry) have been

introduced and studied in the literature [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. owing to their zero

tension, the worldvolume of the null p-branes is a light-like, (p + 1)-dimensional hyper-

surface, imbedded in the minkowski space-time. correspondingly, the determinant of

the induced metric is zero. as in the tensile case, the null brane actions can be written

in reparametrization and space-time conformally invariant form. however, their dis-

tinguishing feature is that at the classical level they may have any number of global

space-time supersymmetries and be -invariant in all dimensions, which support ma-

jorana (or weyl) spinors. at the quantum level, they are anomaly free and do not

exhibit any critical dimension, when appropriately chosen operator ordering is applied

[11, 3, 4, 7, 12]. the only exception are the tensionless branes with manifest conformal

invariance, with critical dimension d = 2 for the bosonic case and d = 2 2n for the
spinning case, n being the number of worldvolume supersymmetries [7].

let us mention also the paper [13], which is devoted to the construction of eld

theory propagators of null strings and p-branes, as well as the corresponding spinning

2

versions.

almost all of the above investigations deal with free null branes moving in at back-

ground (a qualitative consideration of null p-brane interacting with a scalar eld has

been done in [4]). the interaction of tensionless membranes (p = 2) with antisymmet-

ric background tensor eld in four dimensional minkowski space, described by means

of wess-zumino-like action, is studied in [14]. the resulting equations of motion are

successfully integrated exactly.

to our knowledge, the only papers till now devoted to the classical dynamics of null

p-branes (p > 1) moving in curved space-times are [15, 16, 17].

in [15], the null p-branes living in d-dimensional friedmann-robertson-walker

space-time with at space-like section (k = 0) have been investigated. the correspond-

ing equations of motion have been solved exactly. it was argued that an ideal uid of

null p-branes may be considered as a source of gravity for friedmann-robertson-walker

universes.

in [16], the classical mechanics of null branes in a gravity background was for-

mulated. the batalin-fradkin-vilkovisky approach in its hamiltonian version was

applied to the considered dynamical system. some exact solutions of the equations

of motion and of the constraints for the null membrane (p = 2) in general stationary

axially symmetric four dimensional gravity background were found. the examples of

minkowski, (a)ds, schwarzschild, taub-nut and kerr space-times were considered.

another exact solution, for the demianski-newman background, can be found in [17].

in this article we consider the classical evolution of tensionless bosonic p-branes in

a particular type of d-dimensional curved background. in sec. 2 we develop a method

3

for solving their equations of motion and constraints. in sec. 3, as an application of the

method proposed, we give an explicit exact solution for the ten dimensional solitonic

ve-brane gravity background. sec. 4 is devoted to our concluding remarks.

2 solving the equations of motion

we will use the following reparametrization invariant action for the null bosonic

p-brane living in a d-dimensional curved space-time with metric tensor gm n (x):

s = z dp+1l

,

m = /m

l = v mv nmxm nxn gm n (x),
m = (0, a) = (, a),

,

(1)

m, n = 0, 1, ..., p

,

a, b = 1, ..., p

,

m, n = 0, 1, ..., d  1.

it is a natural generalization of the at space-time action given in [5, 6].

let us rewrite the lagrangian density from (1) into the form ( = /, a =

/a):

l =

1
40 gm n (x)(  aa)xm (  bb)xn ,

where the connection between v m and (0, a) is given by

v m = (v 0, v a) =  

1
20

,

a

20!.

the euler-lagrange equation for xk are

" 1

+

20 (  bb)xk#  a" a
1
20 k

20 (  bb)xk#
m n (  aa)xm (  bb)xn = 0,

4

(2)

(3)

where k

m n is the connection compatible with the metric gm n (x):

k

m n =

1
2

gkl(m gn l + n gm l  lgm n ).

the equations of motion for the lagrange multipliers 0 and a which follow from (2)

give the constraints:

gm n (x)(  aa)xm (  bb)xn = 0,
gm n (x)(  bb)xm axn = 0.

(4)

(5)

from now on, we will work in the gauge 0, a = constants, in which the equations

(3) have the form :

(  aa)(  bb)xk + k

m n (  aa)xm (  bb)xn = 0.

(6)

we are going to look for solutions of the equations of motion (6) and constraints (4),

(5) for the following type of gravity background

ds2 = gm n dxm dxn

(7)

= gqq(dxq)2 + 2gqsdxqdxs + gss(dxs)2 + gdxdx +xi

gii(dxi)2,

where xq 6= xs are two arbitrary coordinates and it is supposed that gm n does not
depend on them.

to simplify the equations of motion (6) and constraints (4), (5), we introduce the

ansatz

xq(, a) = c qf (za) + yq( ),

xs(, a) = c sf (za) + ys( ),

(8)

xm (, a) = ym ( )

for

m 6= q, s;

za = a + a,

5

where f (za) is an arbitrary function of za, and c q, c s are constants. inserting (8) in

(4), (5) and (6), one obtains (the dot is used for d/d )

yk + k

m n ym yn = 0,

gm n ym yn = 0,

(c qgqq + c sgqs) yq + (c qgqs + c sgss) ys = 0.

(9)

(10)

(11)

it turns out that for the given metric (7), the equations for yq and ys in (9) become

linear dierential equations. on the other hand, with the help of (11), we can separate

the variables in them. the corresponding solution, compatible with (11), is (c = const)

yq( ) = c (c qgqs + c sgss) exp(h),
ys( ) = +c (c qgqq + c sgqs) exp(h),
h = z (cid:16)gqqdgqq + 2gqsdgqs + gssdgss(cid:17).

(12)

now we observe that if we introduce the matrix

h = 


then the following equality holds

gqq gqs

gqs gss

,




exp (h) = exp(cid:18)z t rh1dh(cid:19) = deth  h.

(13)

at the same time, the above equality is the compatibility condition for the solution

(12) with the other equations of motion and constraint (10).

using (12) and (13), the equations for the other coordinates and the remaining

constraint can be rewritten as (k, m, n 6= q, s)

yk + k

m n ym yn +

1
2

gkmm (cid:18)c 2 g

h(cid:19) = 0,

6

gm n ym yn +(cid:18)c 2 g

h(cid:19) = 0,

(14)

where

g = (c q)2gqq + 2c qc sgqs + (c s)2gss.

at this stage, taking into account the general structure of the string theory gravity

backgrounds in d dimensions, we introduce an additional restriction on the metric (7).

namely, we suppose that the set of values of the index m is expressed by the subsets

m = (q, s, , i) such that gm n does not depend on coordinates x(, a) = y( ) in

addition to xq, xs. under this condition, one can reduce the order of the dierential

equations for y by one with the result

y = exp(cid:18)z gdg(cid:19) c ,

c  = constants.

(15)

the condition on (15) to be in accordance with the equations for yi and the constraint

(14) is

2

dg
d

y y + g

d

d (cid:16) y y(cid:17) = 0,

and it is identically satised.

let us turn to the equations of motion for the remaining coordinates yi. these are:

yi + i

jk yj yk +

1
2

gij(cid:20)j(cid:18)c 2 g

h(cid:19)  (jg) y y(cid:21) = 0,

(16)

where y are given by (15). the following step is to use the equality

(jg) y y = j (cid:16)g y y(cid:17) ,

7

which is an identity on the solutions (15). this allow us to transform the equations

(16) into the form:

d

d (cid:16)gij yj(cid:17)  (igjk) yj yk + i(cid:18)c 2 g

h

+ v(cid:19) = 0,

2

where

v = (cid:18)c exp(cid:18)z gdg1(cid:19)(cid:19)

g(cid:18)exp(cid:18)z g1dg(cid:19) c(cid:19)

.

taking into account that the matrix gij is a diagonal one, we can further transform the

equations for yi( ) to obtain (there is no summation over i):

d

d (cid:16)gii yi(cid:17)2

+ yii(cid:20)gii(cid:18)c 2 g

h

+ v(cid:19)(cid:21) + yixj6=i

i  gii

gjj!(cid:16)gjj yj(cid:17)2

= 0.

(17)

in receiving (17), the constraint (14) rewritten in the form

gii( yi)2 +xj6=i

gjj( yj)2 + v + c 2 g
h

= 0

(18)

is also used.

now it is evident from (17) that we can reduce the order of these dierential equa-

tions by one, if

or

i  gii

gjj! = 0

for

i 6= j

i(cid:16)gjj yj(cid:17)2

= 0

for

i 6= j.

(19)

(20)

keeping in mind the aim to apply our results to the string theory gravity backgrounds,

we choose the following combination of the two existing possibilities: for all coordinates

8

yi except one, which we call yr, the equalities (19) are fullled; for i = r, the equalities

(20) hold. then the result of integration, compatible with (18), is

(cid:16)gkk yk(cid:17)2

= ck(cid:16)yr, ..., yk1, yk+1, ...(cid:17)  gkk(cid:18)c 2 g
= ek(cid:16)..., yk1, yk, yk+1, ...(cid:17) ,

h

+ v(cid:19)

(grr yr)2 = grr( xk 1!(cid:18)c 2 g

h

= er(yr),

k gkk

gii ! = 0,

k 6= q, s, , r.

+ v(cid:19) xk

ck

gkk)

(21)

(22)

(23)

here ck, ek and er are arbitrary functions. ck depend on all coordinates on which

depends the metric, but yk (for every xed value of k). ek do not depend on yr, but

depend on yk. obviously, the right hand sides of (21) and (22) have to be nonnegative.

now, we are interested in nding exact solutions of the above equations. it turns

out that it is preferable to use a slightly dierent approach for multi dimensional and for

lower dimensional space-times. this will allow us to obtain solutions in more general

class of metrics in the lower dimensional case. at rst, we will try to nd solutions

appropriate for application to higher dimensional backgrounds.

a simple analysis shows that we can integrate the equations (21) and (22) com-

pletely, if we x the coordinates on which the background depends, except yr. we prefer

to consider just this possibility in connection with further applications in mind. because

gm n = gm n (yr, yk), (k 6= q, s, , r), we x the coordinates yk: yk = yk
then the exact solution of the equations of motion and constraints for a null p-brane

0 = constants.

in the above equalities g0

m n (yr) = gm n (yr, yk

0) and analogously for g0, h0, v 0

and c 0

let us turn to the lower dimensional case. this separate consideration is necessary,

because in obtaining the solution (24) we have restricted the metric to be independent

on too many variables.

in four dimensions for instance, it is preferable to have a

metric, which depends at least on two of the coordinates. this gives us the possibility

to consider dierent types of black hole backgrounds for example. taking this into

account, now we would like to nd exact solutions of the dierential equations (21),

(22) for background metric, which does not depend only on yq and ys. to this end, we

set  = {} and choose the coordinates yk, (k 6= q, s, r) to be constant. then for the
remaining coordinates one obtains

(25)

the corresponding exact solution for the tensionless p-brane in the chosen d - dimen-

sional gravity background is given again by (8) with (25) inserted in there.

finally, we note that for obtaining exact solutions in cosmological type backgrounds,

one can identify x0 with yr in (24) or in (25).

3 the explicit solution

in this section we are going to apply the method proposed in the previous one

for nding an explicit exact solution. we start by considering a null p-brane moving

in the solitonic ( d  1)-brane background [18]

ds2 = gm n dxm dxn = exp (2a) dxdx + exp (2b)(cid:16)dr2 + r2d2

the (d  d  1)-dimensional sphere sd d1 is supposed to be parameterized so that

gd1,d1 = exp (2b) r2.

d  k  1 = 1, 2, ..., d  d  2,

if we now set q = 0,  = 1, 2, ..., d 2, d  1, s = d  1, r = d, k = d + 1, ..., d  2, the
conditions (23) are fullled and we can use the general formula (24). the result is

let us restrict ourselves to the particular case of ten dimensional solitonic 5-brane

background. the corresponding values of the parameters d, d and d are d = 10,

d = 6, d = 2. taking this into account and performing the integration in (26), one

obtains the following explicit exact solution of the equations of motion and constraints

for a tensionless p-brane living in such curved space-time

4 concluding remarks

in this paper we performed some investigation on the classical dynamics of the

null bosonic branes in a curved space-time.

in the second section, we have found

exact solutions of the equations of motion and constraints for a null p-brane in two

particular types of d-dimensional curved backgrounds. however, the latter are general

enough to include in itself many interesting cases of string theory gravity backgrounds

in dierent dimensions (like black branes, intersecting branes and cosmological type

backgrounds). in the third section, we gave an explicit example of exact solution for

the solitonic 5-brane curved background in ten dimensions.

let us nally note that there exists another ansatz which leads to the same type of

13

exact solutions and it is

xq(, a) = c qf (za) + yq(),

xs(, a) = c sf (za) + ys(),

xm (, a) = ym ()

for

m 6= q, s,

where  is one of the worldvolume coordinates 1, . . . , p.
