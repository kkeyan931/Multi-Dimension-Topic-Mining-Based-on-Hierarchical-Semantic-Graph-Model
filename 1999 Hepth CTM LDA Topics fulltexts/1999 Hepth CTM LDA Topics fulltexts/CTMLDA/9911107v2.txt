abstract

a proof of renormalizability of the theory of the dynamical non-abelian
two-form is given using the zinn-justin equation. two previously unknown
symmetries of the quantum action, dierent from the brst symmetry, are
needed for the proof. one of these is a gauge fermion dependent nilpotent
symmetry, while the other mixes dierent elds with the same transformation
properties. the brst symmetry itself is extended to include a shift transfor-
mation by use of an anticommuting constant. these three symmetries restrict
the form of the quantum action up to arbitrary order in perturbation theory.
the results show that it is possible to have a renormalizable theory of massive
vector bosons in four dimensions without a residual higgs boson.

i. introduction

each and every aspect of the standard model has been tested in recent years, with re-
markable agreement with theory, except in one sector. the standard model predicts the
existence of the higgs boson, responsible for making gauge bosons and fermions massive, as
well as breaking the su(2)u(1) symmetry of the theory down to the u(1) of electromag-
netism. but no elementary scalar has yet been observed in any particle interaction, nor has
any experiment so far detected the higgs boson, either elementary or composite. on the
other hand, various theoretical constraints put the upper bound of the higgs boson mass
only a little out of reach of present day experiments. it is therefore useful to consider the
scenario in which the higgs boson remains unobserved as the theoretical bounds are reached.
apart from the higgs boson and a possible neutrino mass, the standard model agrees
quite closely with experiment, so it is a good idea to leave most of the theory untouched.
the role of the higgs boson may be distributed among possibly dierent mechanisms for
generating vector and fermion masses, and symmetry breaking. the higgs mechanism does
all this in a renormalizable and unitary way [1], and any alternative must not aect these
good quantum properties of the theory. a possible alternative for generating vector boson
masses is to use a dynamical two-form. when an antisymmetric tensor potential b is coupled
to the eld strength f of a u(1) gauge eld via a topological b  f coupling and a kinetic
term for b is included, the gauge eld develops an eective mass [25]. the mass is equal
to the dimensionful coupling constant m of the interaction term, and there is no residual
scalar (higgs) degree of freedom. if a non-abelian version of this theory can be consistently
quantized, it may be applied to particle interactions.

no-go theorems [6,7] based on the consistency of quantum symmetries rule out most,
but not all, alternative higgs free mechanisms of mass generation for non-abelian vector
bosons. one useful exception is the topological mass generation mechanism [8] which has
seen renewed interest in recent years [911]. this mechanism uses an auxiliary vector eld
to close the symmetry algebra and thus avoid the no-go theorems. the price one has to pay
is to have non-propagating bosonic and ghost elds in the theory, which disappear in the
abelian limit. the no-go theorem of ref. [7] says only that the non-abelian model cannot
be constructed from the abelian model, which is known to be quantizable [4]. it does not
rule out the quantizability of the non-abelian model itself. however that is not in itself a
proof that the non-abelian model is quantizable, and a proof has not been constructed as
yet. the rst step in such a proof is the construction of a brst-invariant tree-level action,
which was done from a geometric point of view in [9] and ab initio in [10].

in this paper i construct the quantum action for this model up to arbitrary order in
perturbation theory starting from the brst-invariant tree-level action. i follow an algebraic
procedure along the lines of what is done for yang-mills theories [12,13]. the construction
itself is rather involved as there are dierent elds with the same transformation properties.
this suggests that the usual brst symmetry is not sucient to restrict the operators in
the quantum action. fortunately there are other useful symmetries of the tree-level action
and they, together with the brst symmetry, are sucient for the purpose. the starting
point of the paper is the classical action given in sec. ii.
in sec. iii i list the brst
transformation rules of the theory and construct another brst-like nilpotent symmetry. in
sec. iv i construct the quantum symmetries corresponding to these and other symmetries,

2

and in sec. v i nd all the dimension four operators allowed by all the symmetries. finally,
sec. vi carries a small discussion of possible extensions and applications of the results. the
main body of the paper sets up the structure of the proof, most of the detailed calculations
are collected in appendices at the end.

ii. tree level action

in this section i shall x my conventions. i shall work with an su(n) gauge group g,

with generators ta satisfying

[ta, tb] = if abc tc,

(2.1)

with the structure constants f abc totally antisymmetric in its indices. the gauge index,
as well as lorentz indices, will be made explicit in general for easier tracking of numerical
coecients. the background metric is taken to have signature ( + ++).

the classical action for the dynamical non-abelian two-form [8] is

s0 =z d4x(cid:18) 

1
4

f a
f a 

1
12

h a

h a +

m
4

ba

f a

(cid:19) .

here f is the curvature of a gauge connection a with gauge coupling g,

f a

 = (

i
g

[d, d])a = aa

  aa

 + gf abcab

ac
 .

(2.2)

(2.3)

the compensated eld strength h is dened with the help of an auxiliary eld c by the
relation

h a

 = (d[b])a + ighf[, c]ia

= [ba

] + gf abcab

[bc

]  gf abcf b

[c c
].

(2.4)

all the three elds a, b and c belong to the adjoint representation of the gauge group
g. the action (2.2) therefore remains invariant under gauge transformations given by

a  uau 1 

i
g

uu 1,

b  ub u 1,

c  ucu 1,

u  g .

(2.5)

in addition, the action s0 is invariant under vector gauge transformations given by

a  a,

b  b + d[],

c  c +  ,

(2.6)

where  is some arbitrary vector eld in the adjoint representation of the gauge group
which vanishes at innity.

for the purpose of power counting, i need the propagators of this theory. let me choose
the usual lorenz gauge aa = 0, ba = 0, with gauge parameters  and  respectively.
then the tree-level propagator for aa

 is

dab

 = 

ab

k2  g  (1  )

kk

k2 ! ,

3

(2.7)

and that for ba

 is

dab

 ,  = 

ab

k2  g[g]  (1  )

g[k]k

k2

! .

(2.8)

there is no quadratic term in the action involving the auxiliary eld c a
 in this gauge, so the
tree level propagator for it will vanish. as a result, there are no diagrams with internal c
lines. this is not actually a problem for perturbation theory as long as there are other elds
which propagate freely. similar situations are known in other eld theories as well [14]. it is
possible to choose some other gauge for which c a
 has a non-vanishing propagator, but that
does not change the arguments.

there is a quadratic coupling term between the vector and the antisymmetric tensor

elds coming from the last term in the action, the vertex given by

v ab
,  = imabk .

(2.9)

the eective tree-level propagator for the vector eld is then calculated by summing all
insertions of the tree-level b propagator into the nave tree-level a propagator [4]. the
result is

ab

k2  m2 g 

kk

k2 !  ab

kk
k4

.

(2.10)

 = 

fdab

this shows that there is a pole in the two-point function of the vector eld aa

level. on the other hand, the massive propagator fdab

 even at tree-
 falls o as 1/k2 at high values of k2,
like in the case of the higgs mechanism. the ultraviolet behavior of the propagators show
that the theory is power-counting renormalizable in this gauge. the best way to proceed
further is via the brst method of quantization.

iii. brst invariance

quantization of this theory requires gauge-xing and therefore the introduction of ghosts.
the gauge xed action, together with the ghost terms, is brst invariant. the vector
gauge symmetry requires ghosts of ghosts, and o-shell nilpotence of the brst charge
requires auxiliary elds. let me write the gauge-xing functions as f a, f a and f a for
gauge transformations, vector gauge transformations and gauge transformations of ghosts,
respectively. in sec. v, i shall choose the gauge functions to be of the usual lorenz gauge
type,

f a = aa,

f a = ba ,

f a = a ,

(3.1)

but most of the results in this paper will hold for arbitrary linear gauge functions. some
discussion about arbitrary gauges is presented in sec. vi.

the tree level quantum action can be written as

s = s0 +z d4x(cid:20)haf a + aa +

haha+ ha

 (f a + na)

+a

a +

ha

1
2

ha   aa + af a + aa +  aai .

(3.2)

here a, a and a are the brst variations, as dened below, of f a, f a and f a,
respectively. the appearance of na in the gauge-xing condition is usual for two-form
gauge-elds. the gauge-xing condition f a = 0 holds upon using the equation of motion
of na [16]. this action is no longer invariant under gauge or vector gauge transformations.
but it is invariant under the brst transformations [9,10]

(3.3)

these transformations are nilpotent, s2 = 0 on all elds, if s has a left action, i.e., the
change in any eld a is given by a = sa, where  is an anticommuting innitesimal
parameter. the tree-level quantum action of eqn.(3.2) is invariant under s, with a = sf a,
a = sf a and a = sf a. it is also possible to write this action as the sum of the classical
action s0 plus a total super-divergence,

 = (cid:18)af a +

 aha(cid:19) (cid:18)a

s = s0 + s ,

with

 (f a + na) +

1
2

 a

ha(cid:19) +(cid:16) af a +  aa(cid:17) .

(3.4)

in addition to the brst transformations, there is another brst-type nilpotent trans-
formation which leaves the action invariant. such a symmetry exists for all gauge theories,
not just the two-form theories, as can be seen from the following argument. the terms in
the extended ghost sector of the tree-level quantum action of a gauge theory are typically
of the form

sc
ext = haf a +

1
2

haha + aa ,

(3.5)

where (a, ha) are the trivial pairs. here the index a stands for the collection of various
indices as well as the spacetime point where the elds are evaluated, f a = 0 is the corre-
sponding gauge-xing condition with gauge parameter , and a = sf a. the sum over a
includes the integration over spacetime. this form of the extended ghost sector is valid for
commuting ha, f a and anticommuting a. for example, all but the last three terms of the
tree-level quantum action (3.2) can be written in this form, where the index a includes the
gauge index a or the pair (a, ) depending on the gauge eld (a or b). this part of the
action remains invariant under brst transformations

sa = ha ,

sha = 0 .

(3.6)

on the other hand, i can rearrange sc

ext as

where i have dened ha = ha 
only thing that comes out of this exercise is the fact that sc

f a. so far, i have not actually done anything. the
ext is invariant under a new set

2


sa = ha  sa = ha +

f a ,

sha = 0  sha = 

2

sf a = a  sf a .

2

sf a ,

(3.8)

therefore, if the action of s on a and ha is as above, and s = s on all other elds, the last
equation is identically satised, and it also follows that s is nilpotent on all elds, s2 = 0 if
a does not contain any auxiliary eld, which is usually the case.

when the extended sector corresponds to an anticommuting gauge eld, as in the case of
gauge-xing of ghost elds, the construction is slightly more complicated, since the auxiliary
elds have odd ghost number. typically, for anticommuting auxiliary elds a, a, the
extended ghost sector can be written as

ext = af a + f aa +  aa + aa .
sa

(3.9)

in this, f a is the anticommuting gauge-xing function, a = sf a, and a is the corre-
sponding commuting antighost. the term f aa is just a rearrangement of the appropriate
terms in aa which appear for the usual gauge symmetries. a term such as f aa must
appear, since a is the ghost for some eld and therefore appears in some a. for example,
in the tree-level quantum action of eqn.(3.2) f aa corresponds to aa, which in turn
is required to cancel the brst variation of ha
na. just as in the case with commuting
auxiliary elds, the terms in sa

ext can be rearranged,

sa

ext =  a +
=   a +

f a! a +
f a! 
f a! a +

=  aa + af a + f aa + aa .

(3.10)

where i have now dened a =   a +

f a! and a =  a +

f a!. as before, in

2


these coordinates sa

ext is invariant under its own set of brst transformations,

s a = a =  a +

f a! ,

2


s f a ,

sf a ,

s a = 0  sa = 

sa = 0  sa = 

sf a = a  sf a .

(3.11)

two more things are required for the nilpotence of s  a was the result of brst variation
of some eld (a = sna in eqn.(3.3))  now a has to be the variation under s of the same
eld, and s f a must be calculated according to the rules of eqn.(3.8) for s acting on the
anticommuting ghosts in f a. in addition, the action of s must be the same as that of s for
the elds contained in f a. then s2 = 0 on all elds.

i can now gather the results of eqn.(3.8) and eqn.(3.11) and apply them to the tree-level

quantum action of eqn.(3.2) to construct this symmetry,

s = s on all other elds.

(3.12)

since the gauge-xing functions do not contain antighosts or auxiliary elds, and since
brst variations of the remaining elds also do not contain antighosts or auxiliary elds, a
straightforward calculation shows that s is nilpotent on all elds,

s2 = 0 .

(3.13)

in addition, since the classical action s0 is invariant under brst transformations, and since
s = s on the fundamental elds,

7

ss0 = 0 .

(3.14)

the remainder of the tree-level quantum action of eqn. (3.2) can be written as a sum of
sc
ext and sa
ext as dened above, and either by the method described above or by an explicit
calculation it can be shown quite easily that this part is also invariant under s. so in fact

ss = 0 .

(3.15)

it should be made clear that s is not special to the dynamical two-form, nor even to re-
ducible gauge systems. usual gauge theories exhibit invariance under a symmetry analogous
to s. but in those cases, this gauge-fermion dependent invariance is not needed for restrict-
ing the form of the quantum action  invariance under the familiar brst transformation s
is sucient for that purpose [12,13]. however, s becomes extremely useful when the theory
contains many dierent elds in the same representation, as in the case of the dynamical
two-form. i shall make extensive use of s to construct the quantum eective action for the
dynamical two-form. in order to do that, i need to look at the quantum symmetries corre-
sponding to s, s and some other classical symmetries of the theory. this is done in the next
section.

iv. symmetries of the effective action

on the way to a proof of perturbative renormalizability of the dynamical non-abelian
two-form, the rst thing to note is that there is no kinetic term for c a
 in the tree-level action.
consequently, c a
 is taken to be dimensionless. the auxiliary ghost eld  is taken to be di-
mensionless for the same reason, and then the theory is power-counting renormalizable. the
presence of elds with vanishing mass dimension does not automatically rule out renormaliz-
ability of a theory [15], but it is possible that the theory will be non-renormalizable because
counterterms may contain arbitrary powers of these elds. therefore, one needs to ensure
that the symmetries of the theory restrict the number of counterterms to a nite value.
perturbative renormalizability requires that the quantum eective action, invariant under
the quantum symmetries, contain only those operators which appear in the tree-level action
of eqn. (3.2) up to arbitrary numerical coecients. the quantum action can be constructed
by use of the zinn-justin equation in the following manner.

the partition function z[j, k] in the presence of external c-number sources j a(x), k a(x)

is

z[j, k] =z hdbi exp(cid:18)is + iz d4xaj a + iz d4xf ak a(cid:19) ,

(4.1)

where f a(x) = sa(x), and i have kept the spacetime integration explicit for this section.
i shall also refer to k a as the antisource corresponding to the eld a. this partition
function leads to the eective action

[, k] = z d4xaj a

,k  i ln z[j,k, k] ,

(4.2)

where j a
being calculated in the presence of k a.

,k is the value of the current for which hb(x)ij,k = b(x), the expectation value

8

the eective action satises the zinn-justin equation [12,13],

(, ) = 0 ,

where the antibracket (f, g) is dened for any two functionals f and g as

(f, g) =z d4x

rf [, k]

a(x)

lg[, k]
k a(x)

z d4x

rf [, k]
k a(x)

lg[, k]

a(x)

.

(4.3)

(4.4)

in order to get a proof of perturbative renormalizability of a theory, the total action

functional s[, k] = s[] + r d4xf ak a is written as a sum of the renormalized action

sr[, k] plus a term s[, k] containing counterterms intended to cancel loop innities.
both sr and s must have the same symmetries as s[, k], so the innite contributions to
 can be cancelled by the counterterms in s if they also have those symmetries.

expanding  in a power series in the loop expansion parameter h,

[, k] =

xn =0

hn 1n [, k] ,

(4.5)

where 0[, k] = sr[, k], the zinn-justin equation can be written order-by order for each
n as

nxn =0

(n , n n ) = 0 .

(4.6)

this expansion automatically includes counterterms corresponding to sub-divergences at
any given loop order n. if for some n all innities appearing at m-loop order have been
cancelled by counterterms in s for all m  n 1, the only remaining innities in eqn.(4.6)
are in n . so the innite part n, of this quantity must satisfy

(sr, n,) = 0 .

(4.7)

for a theory which is renormalizable in the power-counting sense, this leads to a simple
mechanical procedure. for such a theory, the innite part n,[, k] must be a sum of
operators of mass dimension four or less.
in addition, all the linear symmetries of the
tree-level action are symmetries of [, k] and therefore of n,[, k].

let me assume for the moment that n,[, k] is at most linear in the antisources k a

for all a,

n,[, k] = n,[, 0] +z d4xf a

n [, x]k a(x) .

if i now dene the quantities

()
n [] = sr[, 0] + n,[, 0] ,

(4.8)

(4.9)

with  innitesimal, the terms independent of k a in eqn.(4.7) imply [13] that ()
invariant under the transformation

n [] is

sra(x) = f ()a

n (x) ,

9

(4.10)

where

f ()a
n (x) = f a(x) + f a

n (x) .

(4.11)

the terms of rst order in k a in eqn.(4.7) imply that this transformation is nilpotent,
r = 0. since n, contains only operators of mass dimension four or less, f ()a
s2
n (x) cannot
be of higher mass dimension than f a(x). in addition, f ()a
n (x) may not aect the linear
symmetries of the action. therefore, f ()a
n (x) must have the same lorentz properties, ghost
number and global gauge transformation properties as f a(x).
n (x) must be
the same as f a(x) if it corresponds to a eld which transforms linearly under s. all that
remains to be done is to construct the most general nilpotent transformation of the elds
under these restrictions, and then to construct the most general functional ()
n [] invariant
under this transformation. if that agrees, up to arbitrary constant numerical coecients,
with the original action s, the theory is perturbatively renormalizable.

in fact f ()a

this entire argument rests on the assumption that n,[, k] is at most linear in all of the
antisources k a. when is this a correct assumption? if a eld a has mass dimension da, the

corresponding k a must have mass dimension 3da so as to maker d4xf ak a dimensionless.

, na, a, a all have mass dimension 2. the
 and a each have mass dimension 3. also, the theory does not have any
, a, a because their brst variations vanish.

the antisources k a for aa
antisources for c a
external antisource k a for the elds ha, ha
therefore n, can be at most quadratic in k a.

, a, a, ba

, a

, a

if a eld a has ghost number a, the corresponding k a will have ghost number a 1.
, na is 1. the ghost
it follows that the ghost number of the antisource for any of aa
 and a is 2, and those of k a corresponding to a
numbers of k a corresponding to a, a
and a are 3 and +1, respectively. the remaining antisources correspond to a and a
,
they carry ghost number 0. the dimensions and ghost numbers of all the elds and their
antisources are given in table i at the end of this paper.

, c a

, ba

some of the quadratic terms can be eliminated straightaway. the brst variations of
, na and a are linear, so the eective action cannot be quadratic in their

the elds a, a
antisources. for example,

so the quantum transformations are the same,

sa = ha,

it follows from eqn.(4.2)that

hsaij,k ,k = ha .

r[, k]

k a[]

= ha ,

(4.12)

(4.13)

(4.14)

for the corresponding antisource k a[]. since this independent of k a, it follows that [, k]
, na and a. let me
is linear in the antisource for a. a similar argument holds for a
now look at the antisources for the remaining elds in the theory. the quantum eective
action [, k] must be linear in the antisources of a and c a
, since these objects have mass
dimension 3 and all other antisources have mass dimension 2. so [, k] is at most quadratic

10

in the antisources of only the other elds. it turns out that [, k] is in fact linear in the
remaining antisources as well. the argument involves showing that the coecients of the
quadratic terms are forced to vanish, term by term, by the dimensions and ghost numbers
of the elds which can possibly appear in them. appendix a contains the details of the
argument.

it follows then that the eective action is at most linear in all the antisources k a, and the
arguments following eqn.(4.7) hold. but the number of possible terms in the eective action
allowed by the (renormalized) brst symmetry sr is still enormous, and it is necessary to
invoke other symmetries to simplify calculations.

let me now consider the eect of the gauge-dependent symmetry s on the eective
action. i take the same partition function z[j, k] and the same eective action [, k] as in
eqs. (4.1) and (4.2), with the same sources j a
,k and the same antisources k a. (this [, k]
was shown to be linear in these k a in appendix a.) let me also denote the minimal elds
by a and non-minimal elds by a. then sa = sa = f a, and consequently sf a[] = 0.
the application of s on the partition function gives (since the tree-level action s is invariant
under s),

z d4x"hf aij,k ,k

l[, k]

l[, k]

(4.15)

now, if the gauge-xing functions are linear in the elds, sa as dened in eqn.(3.12) is
either linear in the elds or equals the brst variation of some linear function of the elds.
therefore, hsaij,k ,k is known in principle from solving the zinn-justin equations. in ad-
dition, the eective action does not contain the antisources corresponding to (ha, ha
, a, a)
, na, a). then i can read o from eqn.(4.15)
and only sr contains the antisources for (a, a

note that i did not fully utilize the nilpotence of s itself. in principle, i could have treated

but that creates a host of other problems. in particular, the eective action is not linear in

s just like s, dening new antisources fk a and deriving an analogue of zinn-justin equation.
these new antisources fk a.

these two renormalized symmetries, sr and sr are sucient to uniquely x the form
of the eective action, as will be shown in the next section. there is a further symmetry
which helps to pin down the form of sr. this symmetry mixes the ghost elds with the
same global properties and quantum numbers.

the action s is invariant under

ts(all others) = 0 ,

(4.18)

where t is the transformation /. note that i have taken  to be commuting only for
convenience. if  is taken to be anticommuting, the action will still be symmetric under
t = l/ provided l a/ = + a, other transformation rules remaining the same. it is
easy to see that the action s is symmetric under t for a large class of gauge-xing functions
f a.

by applying t on the partition function (4.1), i get the ward identities

where the quantum averages h i are calculated in the presence of the currents and antisources
j,k, k as before, and k a[] is the antisource for a. since ta = a, ta = a are linear
in the elds, their quantum averages are the same. as for the other two, ta
 and
ta = sa, so the quantum averages of the quantities on the left hand side are known. i
can then write this equation as

the interpretation of these equations is obvious. eqn.(4.22) says that ()

n [] is invariant

under tr, where

tr a = a ,
tra
 = sraa
 ,
tra = a ,
tra = sra ,

tr(all others) = 0 ,

(4.25)

the rst equation following that, eqn.(4.23), shows that trsr = 0 on all elds except a,
and eqn.(4.24) shows that trsra = sra. there are no surprises, except perhaps the
fact that these conditions are actually useful in restricting the form of sr to what is shown
in appendix b.

v. the most general effective action

in this section i shall use brute force methods to show that the eective action contains
the same terms, up to arbitrary multiplicative renormalizations, as the tree-level action of
eqn.(3.2). the proof requires construction of the most general nilpotent transformation of
the elds, sr, as discussed in the previous section. the actual construction of sr is a rather
involved digression, so i have separated it into appendix b. the result of sr on the various
elds is given in eqn.(b32).

now i need to construct the most general functional ()

n symmetric under sr as well
as under the linear symmetries of s. these are (i) lorentz invariance, (ii) global su(n)
invariance, and (iii) ghost number conservation. however, it is obvious that even with
the restrictions imposed by sr and these three symmetries, there is an enormous number

13

of possible terms. since c a

possible to multiply any other term by a scalar polynomial of the form

 has mass dimension zero as well as ghost number zero, it is
c a), and still
maintain the three abovementioned symmetries. of course, such terms are not sr-invariant
by themselves, but one can imagine that their variations cancel against those of something
else, and ruling out each such term requires a long and tedious calculation. and even without
this unwanted complexity, there are of the order of one hundred terms satisfying the three
linear symmetries. applying sr to a sum of so many terms, multiplied by unknown scalar
polynomials of c a
, and then nding the combination which remains invariant, would require
unlimited time and perseverance. fortunately, there is a way out of this quagmire, provided
by s.

(c a

npk=1

as before, let me denote the minimal elds by a and non-minimal elds by a. let me

also dene s

r  1

2(sr  sr). then from eqn.(4.15),

ra = 0 , s
s

ra 6= 0 .

(5.1)

the non-minimal elds a are (a, a, a
, na). let me also choose the gauge
xing functions to be specically those in eqn. (3.1). because of my choice of gauge-xing
functions, the action exhibits invariance under constant shifts of a, a, a
 and na. since
these are linear symmetries, i can impose them on the eective action. in other words, these
elds must appear in the quantum eective action only as derivatives, i.e., as  a etc.

, a, ha, a, ha

then on dimensional grounds, the eective action will be at most quadratic in the a. i

can then write the eective action in the generic form

 =xa

ax a +xa,b

abx ab ,

(5.2)

where x a and x ab do not contain any of the a, and have appropriate transformation
properties, dimension and ghost number. in particular, x a and x ab are assumed to include
derivative operators as necessary for the constant shift symmetries mentioned above, and
the sum over indices will be taken to include an integral over spacetime unless specied
otherwise. since both sr and sr are symmetries of the eective action, i have

and from eqn.(5.1), i have

s
r = 0 ,

rx a = s
s

rx ab = 0 .

(5.3)

(5.4)

therefore using eqn.(5.2) i can write

xa

(s

ra)x a +xa,b

(s

ra)bx ab +xa,b

(1)aa(s

rb)x ab = 0 .

(5.5)

here a (not to be confused with the a of eqs. (a3) and (a4)) is the grassmann parity of
the eld a.

since x a and x ab do not contain any of the a by denition, i can now look at the
coecients of the various a in the expansion of eqn.(5.5) and set them to zero in order

14

to get an expression for the eective action . many of the terms are thus eliminated, and
some algebraic relations appear among some of the rest. the details of the calculation are
given in appendix c. the result is the eective lagrangian of eqn.(c41) which i give here
again,

lg = ax a

x a

hh + ha(cid:16)hb

.

(5.6)

the undetermined coecients satisfy several relations among themselves as shown in ap-
pendix c.

the number of unknown coecients can be reduced even further. just as the symmetry
s
r = 0 produced relations among several of these xs, the quantum brst symmetry
itself, sr = 0, should produce some more relations independent of the previous ones. the
expression for the sr-variation is

sr =xa h(sra)x a + (1)aa(srx a)i

+xabh(sra)bx ab + (1)aa(srb)x ab + (1)a+bab(srx ab)i = 0. (5.7)

since srx a and srx ab do not contain any of the a, i can consider the coecients of a
or of ab in the above expression and set them to zero.

the calculation is fairly straightforward, but in keeping with other calculations in this
paper, i have again separated this one into appendix d. the result is that the functional
forms of all the unknown coecients become known, and only two arbitrary constants are
needed to write them, as shown in eqn. (d19).

i can now write down the general form of the ghost sector of the theory as

lg = z aa

r + z aa

r + z a

r + z af a + z haf a + z ha

 (f a + na)

(5.10)

i nd that the zinn-justin equation just says that the ghost-free sector is invariant under
these gauge transformations. the factor n6/n4 can be absorbed either in c a
 itself or in
the renormalization of a duciary coupling constant gc which always appears in front of c a
.
the procedure described so far can be used to construct eective actions for dierent
theories involving the non-abelian two-form. for example, it may be interesting to apply it
to the recently proposed rst-order formulation of yang-mills theory [17]. however, since i
have a specic theory in mind, i will need to invoke another symmetry in order to eliminate
unwanted terms from the non-ghost sector.

this symmetry was an invariance of the classical equations of motion under

ba

  ba

 + f a



(5.11)

with  a constant. it was suggested in [8] that this symmetry could play a role in preventing
terms of the form (b  dc)2 or (b  dc)  (b  dc) from appearing in the action. of
course, since the classical action is not invariant but changes by a total derivative, it is
nontrivial to elevate this to a quantum symmetry. classically this symmetry leads to a
conserved current

j 
t = h af a

 + m(aa

f a

 

2
3

) .

(5.12)

but there is no corresponding conserved current for the brst-invariant action s of
eqn.(3.2), which was the starting point of quantization. this part of the problem can
be circumvented quite easily by incorporating the shift into the brst transformation for
ba

, which now reads (cf. eqn.(3.3))
c + [a

 = gf abcbb

sba

] + gf abcab

[c

] + gf abcf b

c + f a
.

(5.13)

here  is an anticommuting constant with ghost number +1, and s = 0. it is trivial to
see that the brst transformation s is still nilpotent, s2 = 0. however, the action is still
not invariant, but is shifted by m
. so it seems that i have not gained
anything, but only recovered a symmetry of the equations of motion. on the other hand,
since i am now dealing with the quantum theory rather than the classical action principle,
i can also generate this term through quantum eects.

4 r d4xf a

f a

for example, this term could be canceled by the transformation of the fermion measure
if fermions are coupled to the gauge eld. under a chiral transformation with a parameter
42m, the eective action changes by  m
, which cancels the eect of
the shift transformation of eqn. (5.11). the action then becomes invariant under the com-
bination of the shift and global chiral transformations. there are other ways of canceling
the term generated by the shift. in any case, symmetry under the shift transformation rules
out terms involving products of (b  d[c]). i can then write down the most general
quantum eective action consistent with the quantum symmetries,

4 r d4xf a

f a

e =z d4x(cid:16)za f a



f a + zb h a



h a + zbf mba

f a

(5.14)

 + lg(cid:17) .

this is the same as the tree-level action up to arbitrary multiplicative constants, which
means that the theory is perturbatively renormalizable.

16

vi. discussion of results

it is time to gather the results. i have given an algebraic proof of perturbative renorma-
lizability of the dynamical non-abelian two-form gauge theory, also known as the topological
mass generation mechanism. it follows that just as in two and three dimensions, it is possible
in four dimensions to have a renormalizable theory of massive non-abelian vector bosons
without a residual higgs particle.

the calculations were done in a specic set of linear gauges, so that antighosts appeared
only as derivatives.
in other linear gauges, the calculations would be more involved, in
particular there would be terms cubic and quartic in the antighosts, but even in such cases
the methods of sec. v should go through. two other symmetries appeared as a result of
using linear gauges  these are s, dened in eqn. (3.12), and t, dened in eqn. (4.17). these
two symmetries were greatly useful for constructing the quantum brst symmetry and for
reducing the number of possible terms in the quantum eective action. these symmetries
would be present in other linear gauges as well, but not in a general nonlinear gauge. the
calculations are extremely tedious for nonlinear gauges, and it is not clear if the quantum
brst symmetry alone is sucient to restrict the terms in the quantum eective action to
the same form as those in the tree-level action in such gauges.

the use of the anticommuting constant  can potentially create problems because it has
vanishing mass dimension, but ghost number +1, by eqn. (5.13). the fact that there is
an anticommuting constant in the theory is not in itself a problem, similar objects appear
in supersymmetric quantum mechanics [18]. one place where problems can arise is the
argument in sec. iv and particularly in appendix a that the quantum eective action is at
most linear in the antisources k a. the argument relied on the fact that the coecients of
these quadratic terms terms had vanishing mass dimension but non-vanishing ghost number,
so they must contain a. now a can be replaced by the constant . but there is no reason to
worry, because the relevant objects have ghost number +2 or more, so at least one a will be
needed to construct any of them, and the rest of the argument remains unchanged. another
possible place for a problem is in the calculation of the general nilpotent transformation
sr, given in the appendix b. some of the elds a could have a term like a in their
transformation rules in principle. other similarly constructed terms are also possible. an
explicit calculation using the t symmetry shows that such terms do not arise.

the original motivation for the theory was to nd a possible alternative for the higgs
sector of the salam-weinberg model of electroweak interactions. what i have shown in
this paper is that it is possible to have massive vector bosons without spontaneous symme-
try breaking. but the problem with applying this mechanism to electroweak interactions
is precisely that there is no symmetry breaking, whereas the observed world has broken
su(2)u(1) symmetry. if i write the lagrangian for the salam-weinberg model without
the higgs eld, and add an su(2) two-form with an action as in eqn.(2.2), all the su(2)
gauge bosons get the same mass, contrary to experiment. all other observed events would
remain uncontradicted.
it has been suggested [11] that by also adding a u(1) two-form,
which would make the photon massive, it may be possible to get the correct mass ratio of
z and w particles. however, agreement with experiment requires an innite parameter in
the classical lagrangian, corresponding to an innite mass for the photon. another way is
to add an explicit symmetry breaking term to the lagrangian, so that the mass term reads

17

m
4

(cid:16)ba

f a

  tan w b3

f(cid:17) ,

(6.1)

where f is the eld strength of the u(1) gauge eld, and w is the weinberg angle. then
by dening the z and photon elds as usual, i can write the quadratic part of this mass
term as



4

(cid:16)mb1

[z](cid:17) .

[a1

] + mb2

[a2

] + m sec w b3

(6.2)

it follows from this that the z is heavier than the w by a factor of sec w (and the
photon is massless). however, because of the explicit symmetry breaking term, the proof of
renormalizability given here is not applicable. so the question of applicability of this model
to electroweak interactions remains open.

18

appendix a: antisource dependence of n,

as was argued in sec. iv, the quantum eective action is at most quadratic in the
antisources. in fact, several of the quadratic terms were eliminated just by looking at the
mass dimensions and brst transformation properties of the elds.
in order to see the
dependence of the eective action on the rest of the antisources, let me write the general
expression of n,[, k] as

n,[, k] = n,[, 0] +z d4x f a

n [, x]k a(x) +z d4x f ab

n [, x]k a(x)k b(x) .

(a1)

, a and a, and the quadratic sum also does
in this there is no k a corresponding to ha, ha
, na and a for reasons described in sec. iv.
not run over the antisources for a, c a

the relation (sr, n,) = 0, when applied to this expression, gives at zeroth order in k a

(a2)

(a3)

here i have used the fact that f ba
n where a, b are the grassmann
parities of k a and k b, 0 for bosonic k a and 1 for fermionic k a. the terms of second
order in the antisources lead to the equation

n = (1)ab f ab

(a4)

the coecient f ab
n [, x] has mass dimension da + db  2, and ghost number a + b + 2,
where da and a are respectively the mass dimension and ghost number of the eld a.
since a has ghost number +1 and mass dimension zero, it is possible to construct functions
of arbitrary positive ghost number and mass dimension zero by taking products of a. since
the quadratic sum runs only over the antisources for the elds aa
, a, it follows
that f ab
n to
take care of its ghost number, which is always positive. so the rst term of eqn. (a4),
f c lf ab

 for all a, b, and a must be present in f ab

n can depend only on a and c a

n /c, must contain for all a, b,

, a, a

, ba

(sa)

n

lf ab
a = (gf abcbc  a)

lf ab

(a5)

the rst term on the right hand side will always appear in f ac lf b/c because f ac
contains a for all a, b, but the second will appear only if f a contains a. (the index n is
suppressed from now on.)

19

in the sum f ac lf b/c, the only terms that contribute a a are for c corresponding
, and c corresponding to a when b is a. this implies, rst of all,
 when b is a
to aa
 or a. in other
that at least one of the indices a, b in f ab must correspond to either a
 or a, the sum f ac lf b/c does not
words, when neither a, b corresponds to a
contain a even after (anti-)symmetrization over a, b, while the sum f c lf ab/c must
contain a. therefore f ab = 0 for all such pairs a, b. so for example f ab(, ) = 0.

now, the only f ac which contribute a a to the sum f ac lf b/c are those for
 or a and all
which one index corresponds to one of (a
these f ac contain only products of a and c a
. looking at f ab of this type, i nd that
each term which can contribute a a to the sum has a factor f ac of the type that vanishes
by the previous argument. for example, if (a, b) correspond to (a, a), the only term in
the sum that could contribute a factor of a is f ac(, ) lf b()/c, which vanishes since
f ac(, ) = 0. explicitly, for this case eqn.(a4) reads

, a), and the other index to aa

z f ac(, )

lf b()

c +z f ac(, )

lf b()

c +z f ac(, )

lf b()

c

lf ab(, )

c

+z f c()

= 0 .

(a6)

the rst term vanishes because f ac(, ) = 0 by the previous argument, the second and
the third terms cannot contain a a, while the fourth term must contain only one factor of
a. since this is impossible, f ab(, ) must also vanish. it follows by a similar argument
that f ab = 0 when both indices correspond to a

 or a.

so the sum f ac lf b/c vanishes for all (a, b), and therefore f ab = 0 for all pairs
(a, b). it follows that n,[, k], and hence the quantum eective action, is at most linear
in the antisources k a, so that the arguments following eqn. (4.7) can be used towards a
proof of renormalizability.

appendix b: renormalized brst transformation

i need to construct a generalized brst transformation of the elds. this is a nilpotent
transformation which aects the lorentz properties, ghost numbers and global gauge trans-
formation properties of the elds in exactly the same way as s of eqn.(3.3) and is identical
with the latter where it is linear. let me calculate the generalized nilpotent transformation
sr for one eld at a time. for the elds which transform linearly under brst, this is the
same as the original s,

sr a = ha ,

srha = 0 ,

srna = a ,

sra = 0 ,

sr a

sr a = a ,

srha

all other coecients in the expression of srba

 vanish identically as a result.

note that it is possible to consider other terms in sr which obey the zinn-justin equation
at rst order in the antisources. i have ignored such terms because they vanish upon using
the symmetry t. let me consider one example, that of a. the zinn-justin equation says
that

sf a[]  gf abcf b[]c = 0 .

on the other hand, from eqn.(4.23) for a, i have

tf a[] = 0 .

the only allowed possibility for f a[] is then

f a[] =

g(dabc

which immediately shows that eabc = 0, and i can write eqn. (b2) for the transformation

the generic form of the eective action is

(c3)

in this appendix, i will construct the most general  obeying eqn.(c2). for each a i
will rst consider coecients of terms containing ab in the expansion of eqn.(c2). there
can be no term of third or higher order in a in the eective action because of the constant
shift symmetries, and therefore the left hand side of eqn.(c2) can be at most quadratic in
the a. the coecients will have as many ghost elds and derivative operators as necessary.
setting the coecients to zero will eliminate some of the terms from the eective action and
produce relations among some others. following the same procedure for the terms linear
in a will produce some more relations. there will also be a few terms not containing any
power of a in the expansion of eqn.(c2). the sum of these should also vanish.

i will consider a in the order (a, a, a

, a, ha, a, ha

, na). terms containing products

of the form ab in the expansion of s

r come from the s

r-variation of

a bx ab

  + a bx ab

  + a bx ab

  + a b

x ab

  + ahb

x ab

h + anbx ab
n ,

(c4)

where the subscripts   etc. indicate the quadratic combination which couples to a given x,
and an asterisk indicates the presence of a lorentz index on the subscript. in the rst term,
x ab
  has to be antisymmetric in [a, b]. therefore, the coecient of ahb in the expansion of
r gives x ab
s

  = 0. the coecients of a b, ahb

 and anb give

x ab

  = x ab

  = x ab

  = 0 ,

(c5)

while the coecient of ab gives x ab
other a) come from

h = x ab

(c6)

(c7)

each of the xs in this equation must contain at least one derivative operator to allow for
the constant shift symmetry of a. therefore, the xs must be constructed only out of
elds of mass dimension zero. since the factors multiplying the xs are all dierent, and
have elds of non-vanishing mass dimension, the only choice for which this equation can be
satised is

x ab

 = x ab

h = x ab

n = x ab

h = 0 .

thus, all terms containing ab are excluded from the eective action.

terms containing ab arise from the terms

as before, i set the coecients of the quadratic terms in the expansion to zero. the coe-
cients of a b, ahb

h has vanishing mass dimension and ghost number 1. since it is not possible

appendix d: derivation of eqn. (5.8)

in this appendix, i shall try to calculate the functions which remained undetermined in
eqn. (5.6) (equivalently, eqn. (c41)). i start from the expression for the sr-variation of ,
which can be written as

sr =xa h(sra)x a + (1)aa(srx a)i

+xabh(sra)bx ab + (1)aa(srb)x ab + (1)a+bab(srx ab)i = 0. (d1)

since srx a and srx ab do not contain any of the a, i can consider the coecients of a
or of ab in the above expression and set them to zero one at a time. i will rst set to
zero the coecients of ab, and then the terms linear in a.

the coecient of nab and hab give

x ab

nn = x ab

hn = 0 ,

while the coecients of ab, hahb, ha

hb

 and ha

nb give

srx ab

 = srx ab

hh = srx ab

hh = srx ab

hn = 0 .

(d2)

(d3)

now, each of the xs in this equation has zero mass dimension, zero ghost number and is
sr-invariant, so each must be a (possibly dierent) constant. let me dene four constants
k1, k2, k3 and k4 as

x ab

 = k1ab ,

x ab

hh = k2ab ,

x ab

hh = k3gab ,

x ab

hn = k 

4 ab .

the coecients of ha, a, ha

, a, a, a, a

 and na give the equations

 + srx a
 x a
x a
  srx a
 + srx a
x a
x a
 = srx a

h = 0 ,
 = 0 ,
h = 0 ,
n = 0 ,
 = srx a

srx a

 = srx a

n = 0 .

(d4)

(d5)

the last equation in this list is redundant as it can be obtained by applying sr to the
previous equations and remembering that s2
 = 0,
but x ab
 must contain a derivative operator to allow for the constant shift symmetry of a
.
so as with the functions in eqn.(d3), x ab
 must be a constant times a derivative operator.
the coecient of ha
4 , so i can write the ghost
sector lagrangian as

b in srlg shows that this constant is k 

r = 0.the coecient of a

b gives srx ab

(d6)

now i can use the unused equations from appendix c. these were eqs. (c17), (c21), (c25),
(c28), (c30), (c35), and (c40).

29

eqn.(c21) now reads

x a

 

k1


a

r = 0 .

in keeping with standard notation, let me rewrite

k1 = z



x a

 = za
r .

eqn.(c25) now becomes

 x a

 +

2


k2a

r = 0 .

as in the above, let me redene the constant,

k2 =


2

z



x a

 = za
r .

eqn.(c17) becomes

1


x a

 

1


k 

4 a

r = 0 ,

which gives upon using eqn.(d8) that

using this and eqn.(d8) i can rewrite eqn.(c33) as

k 

4 = z g .

(d7)

(d8)

(d9)

(d10)

(d11)

(d12)

z haa  z haa 

2


k3 haa + z haa = 0 ,

(d13)

from which it follows that

k3 =


2

z .

(d14)

this automatically satises eqn.(c28). with these redenitions i get from eqn.(c30) that

the right hand side vanishes upon using f a = ba . also, eqn.(c35) can be written as

x a

h = zf a .

(d15)

 x a

 +

1


x a

 

1


z f a + z a

r = 0.

(d16)

using eqs. (d5),(d8),(d10) and (d16), i can dene some new functions and write

x a

h = zf a + x a
h ,
1
 = za +


x a

 = zf a + x a
 ,

x a

 x a
 ,

x a

h = zf a +

1


 x a

h ,

sr x a

h = x a
 .

(d17)

30

then eqn.(d15) implies, because x a
function, that

h is a function of the elds and not an arbitrarily chosen

x a

h = 0 , and hence x a

 = 0 .

(d18)

putting these into eqn.(c40), i get x a
form of the ghost sector of the theory as

h = 0. therefore, i can now write down the general

lg = z aa

r + z aa

r + z a

a

r + z af a + z haf a + z ha
