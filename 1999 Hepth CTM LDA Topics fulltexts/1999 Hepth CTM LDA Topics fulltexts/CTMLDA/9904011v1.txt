we perform the spherical symmetric dimensional reduction 4d  2d of heterotic string
theory. we nd a class of two-dimensional (2d) dilaton gravity models that gives a
general description of the near-horizon, near-extremal behavior of four-dimensional
(4d) heterotic string black holes. we show that the duality group of the 4d theory is
realized in two dimensions in terms of weyl transformations of the metric. we use the
2d dilaton gravity theory to compute the statistical entropy of the near-extremal 4d,

1 introduction

the black hole solutions of four-dimensional (4d) heterotic string theory are very interest-
ing from several points of view [1]. they give a general description of the whole set of charged
black hole solutions of string theory (and general relativity) in four dimensions. heterotic,
type iia and type iib strings in four dimensions are connected one with the other by a
web of dualities [2, 3], so that one can use the black hole solutions of 4d heterotic string
theory as representative for the whole set of 4d black hole solutions in string theory. more-
over, using truncated models, it has been realized that there are only four classes of black
holes, which can be described by eective 4d dilaton gravity models with dilaton coupling
a = 3, 1, 1/3, 0 [4, 5].
the universal character of these solutions has found support both from the compositeness
idea, according to which the a = 1, 1/3, 0 solutions can be considered as bound states of
the a = 3 elementary solution [5] and from the interpretation of them as intersection of
d-branes [6].

each class of 4d heterotic string black holes is characterized by its spacetime structure,
its singularities and its thermodynamical behavior. particularly remarkable is the behavior
of the a = 0 black hole (essentially the reissner-nordstrom black hole of general relativity)
compared with that of the a = 1,3, 1/3, cases. the extremal limit of the a = 0 black hole
is a zero-temperature ground state with non vanishing entropy, whereas for a = 1,3, 1/3
at the extremal limit we have zero temperature and entropy. the previous features can
be understood using dierent approaches, even though a complete and satisfactory picture
of the all subject is still missing. for instance, the existence of a ground state with the
previously described behavior can be traced back to the presence of a mass gap. this mass
gap can be explained both using string theory [7] or just general features of the 4d eective
dilaton gravity theory [8].

until now the various attempts to give a general description and to clarify the subject
have mainly approached it from above , i.e using higher dimensional, d  4, models. the
recently proposed adsd (anti-de sitter)/ cftd1 (conformal eld theory) correspondence
[9] from one side and the discovery of dualities between four- and two-dimensional black
holes [10] from the other side, have changed slightly the perspective. for d = 2, 3 the
ads/cft duality has been used to compute the statistical entropy of 2d and 3d black holes
[11, 12]. on the other hand, it is known that near the horizon the geometry of the 4d,
magnetically charged, a = 0, 1, 1/3 black hole factorizes as the product of two spaces of
constant curvature, m2  s2, where s2 is the two-sphere and m2 is 2d minkowski space
for a = 1 and m2 = ads2 for a = 0, 1/3 [3].
it is therefore natural to try to extend
[12] of the statistical entropy to the 4d case. the hope is that
the computation of ref.
the explanation of the entropy in terms of microstates will also help to explain the dierent
behavior of the various black hole solutions.

motivated by the previous arguments, in this paper we perform a generic 4d  2d,
spherical symmetric dimensional reduction of 4d eective heterotic string theory. we nd
that the near-horizon, near-extremal behavior of 4d heterotic string black holes are described
by a class of 2d dilaton gravity models. we show that these 2d models encode all the relevant
information about the 4d theory but in a much simpler form. in particular, we show that the
duality group of the 4d theory is realized in the 2d theory in terms of weyl transformations

1

of the metric and we use the 2d dilaton gravity model to compute the statistical entropy of
the near-extremal 4d, a = 1/3, black hole.

in sect. 2 we describe the dimensional reduction 4d  2d of heterotic string theory and
the single-scalar eld truncation that produces the eective 2d dilaton gravity models. in
sect. 3 we study the realization of the 4d duality symmetry in the 2d context, showing
that it corresponds to weyl transformations of the metric. in sect. 4 we use the 2d dilaton
gravity model together with the results of ref. [12] to compute the statistical entropy of the
near-extremal, 4d, a = 1/3, black hole. finally in sect. 5 we draw our conclusions.

2 dimensional reduction of 4d heterotic string theory

in the string frame the bosonic action for heterotic string theory compactied on a six-

torus [13, 14] can be written as follows:

ah =

16 z d4x g e2nr + 4()2  2h()2 + ()2i
4i(cid:27) .
4 he22f 2

1 + e2+2f 2

2 + e2+2f 2

3 + e22f 2

(1)

in the bosonic action of heterotic string theory toroidally compactied to d = 4, we have
set to zero the axion elds and all the u(1) eld strengths but four, two kaluza-klein elds
f1, f2 and two winding modes f3, f4. in the action (1) and throughout this paper we set the
4d newton constant g = 1. the scalar elds , ,  are related to the standard denitions of
the string coupling, kahler form and complex structure of the torus, through the equations

e2 = ims,

e2 = imt,

e2 = imu.

(2)

the extremal, bogomolny-prasad-sommereld (bps), solutions of the action (1) are given
by (see for instance ref. [15])

ds2 = 13 dt2 + (24)1 (dr2 + r2d2

2 is the metric of the two-

f1 = d1  dt,

f3 = d3  dt,
where (1)1, (3)1, (2)1, (4)1 are harmonic functions, d2
sphere and f2 = e2(+)f2, f4 = e2(+)f4 ( denotes the hodge dual).

motivated by the fact that the action (1) admits solutions that are the direct product
of two two-dimensional spaces of constant curvature m2  s2 [3], we study the general,
spherical symmetric, dimensional reduction 4d  2d of the theory.
let us rst x our notation. greek letters from the middle of the alphabet denote 4d
spacetime indices, ,  . . . = 0, 1, 2, 3. greek letters from the beginning of the alphabet
denote 2d spacetime indices, ,  . . . = 0, 1. the capital latin letters i, j.. = 2, 3 label the
coordinates of the internal two-sphere, s2. the lower-case latin letters i, j . . . = 1, 2, 3, 4 are
used to label the four u(1) eld strengths f(i) whereas a, b . . . = 1, 2, 3 label the moduli,
a = (, , ).

2

the dimensional reduction of the 4d theory is performed by splitting the metric and the

u(1) eld strengths into their 2d parts, using the ansatz

ds2

(4) = ds2

(2) + q2e2d2
2,
f(i) = nf(i), f(i)ijo ,

(4)

where qe is the radius of the two-sphere, q is a constant that is related to the u(1) charges
(see eq. (7) below) and the scalar elds a,  depend only on the 2d spacetime coordinates.
the 4d eld equations together with the ansatz (4) constrain strongly the form of the

elds strengths f(i), we nd

f(i)ij = piij , f(i) = qie2bi2.

(5)

in the previous equations, and in the following, the dot means scalar product in the moduli
space, bi are the vectors:

b1 = (1, 1, 1),

b2 = (1, 1,1),

b3 = (1,1,1),

b4 = (1,1, 1),

(6)

whereas pi, qi are respectively the magnetic and electric charge-vectors that characterize the
particular dimensional reduction. for sake of simplicity, we will consider only vectors of the
form,

pi = q pi,

qi = q qi,

(7)

where pi and qi are vectors with entries 0 or 1.

the form of pi and qi determines the 4d background on which we are performing the
dimensional reduction. in general dierent charge-vectors will give rise to dierent 2d models.
the 4d solutions are connected one with the other by o(3,z) duality transformations, some
of them change the spacetime structure of the solutions, others leave it invariant [3]. the
most ecient way to organize the spectrum of the 4d solutions is to use the o(3,z) duality
symmetries together with the compositeness idea [3].

it looks therefore very natural to use the same procedure of ref.

[3] to classify the 2d
models deriving from the dimensional reduction of the action (1). the 4d solutions can
be classied in multiplets, labeled by n, of a given number (up to four) of elementary
constituent, on which the duality symmetry o(3, z) acts in a natural way [3] . moreover,
the multiplets with n = 1, 2, 3, 4 can be put in correspondence with the solutions of the
single-scalar, single u(1) eld strength model [4, 5],

16 z d4x g (cid:26)r  2( )2 
with coupling a given respectively by a = 3, 1, 1/3, 0.

a =

e2a f 2(cid:27) ,

(8)

it turns out that 4d solutions characterized by the same number of magnetic and electric
elementary constituents produce after dimensional reduction the same 2d model. for this
reason the various dimensional reductions (or equivalently the corresponding 2d models) can
be classied by giving, apart form n, the numbers n, m of electric, respectively, magnetic
elementary constituents, with the obvious constrain n = n + m. in this way one obtains 8
dierent 2d models, which can be put in correspondence with bps states of the 4d model (1),

n = 1 multiplet, a = 3,

n = 1, m = 0,
n = 0, m = 1,

qi = (1, 0, 0, 0),
qi = 0,

pi = 0;
pi = (0, 1, 0, 0).

(9)

n = 2 multiplet, a = 1,

n = 2, m = 0,
n = 0, m = 2,
n = 1, m = 1,

n = 3 multiplet, a = 1

pi = 0;
pi = (0, 1, 0, 1);

qi = (1, 0, 1, 0),
qi = 0,
qi = (1, 0, 0, 0),

pi = (0, 0, 0, 1).

(10)

n = 2, m = 1,
n = 1, m = 2,

qi = (1, 0, 1, 0),
qi = (1, 0, 0, 0),

pi = (0, 1, 0, 0);
pi = (0, 1, 0, 1).

n = 4 multiplet, a = 0,

n = 2, m = 2,

qi = (1, 0, 1, 0),

pi = (0, 1, 0, 1).

(11)

(12)

in the previous equations we have given only one representative element for each model,
characterized by pi and qi. there are, of course, dierent values of the u(1) charge-vectors
that give rise to the same 2d model. for instance, the model with n = 1, n = 1, m = 0 can
be obtained not only with the values of qi given in eq. (9), but also when pi = 0 and qi has
one entry equal to one, the others being zero. this degeneracy is related with the duality
symmetries of the theory and will be discussed in detail in the next section.

in the following we will use s(n, m) to denote a dimensional reduction associated with a
state with n elementary constituents, of which m are magnetic (n = n  m). we can now
perform explicitly the dimensional reduction of the model (1) dened by the ansatz (4). the
duality symmetry group o(3, z) contains o-shell dualities, for this reason it is convenient to
perform the dimensional reduction at the level of the equation of motion instead of directly
dimensionally reducing the action (1). using the ansatz (4) and the equations (5) in the 4d
eld equations steming from the action (1), we get the following 2d eld equations,

where the curvature r and all the dierential operators are 2d quantities, the eld  is the
2d dilaton related, as usual, to the 4d dilaton  by

 =   ,

(17)

and the vector a is now dened in terms of , a = (, , ).

the eld equations (13)-(16) are rather complicated. they assume a much simpler form
by considering a consistent, single-scalar eld truncation that reduces them to those of 2d
gravity coupled to the dilaton . these models have been widely investigated in recent years
under the name of 2d dilaton gravity. the single-scalar eld truncation is obtained using an
ansatz expressing the elds , ,  in terms of the dilaton  in a way that is consistent with
the eld equations (13)-(16),

where a = q3/2 for n = 1, a = 1 for n = 2, 3, 4. c = 1 for the states s(1, 1), s(2, 1),

s(1, 1), s(1, 0), s(3, 2), s(3, 1); c = 0 for s(2, 2), s(2, 0), s(2, 1), s(4, 2).
after inserting eqs. (9)-(12) and (18) into the eld equations (13)-(16), we nd that, for
n = 1, 2, 3, they are equivalent to those derived from a class of 2d dilaton gravity models
whose action has the form,

a2 =

1

2 z d2x g e2hr + ()2 + 2v ()i ,

(19)

where 2 = 1/q2 for n = 1, 2, and 2 = 1/(2q2) for n = 3. the kinetic coecient  and
the dilaton potential v are completely determined in terms of n, m, a, n,

f 2 + 2(cid:21) ,

which describes the heterotic string in 2d target-space [16].

the class of dilaton gravity models dened by the action (19) contains, as particular
cases, models that have been already investigated in the past. for n = 2, m = 2 the action
describes the callan-giddings-harvey-strominger (cghs) model [17]. for n = 2, m = 1
we get the weyl rescaled cghs model investigate in ref.
[18]. finally, for n = 3, m = 2
we obtain the jackiw-teitelboim (jt) model [19].

in general the 2d dilaton gravity model (19) give a near-horizon description of the, near-
extremal, 4d black hole solution of the action (1). this near-horizon description corresponds
to setting to zero the constant term in the harmonic functions appearing in eq. (3). on
the other hand, one can easily verify that this is exactly the way to make the ansatz (18)
consistent the 4d extremal solutions (3).

3 dualities and weyl transformations

in the canonical frame gc = e2gs, the 4d eld equations following from the action (1) are
invariant under the action the o(3, z) duality group that acts on the moduli , ,  and on
the u(1) eld strengths but leaves the 4d metric unchanged [3]. the o(3, z) duality group
can be generated using three s  t  u duality transformations s, t , u together with the
permutation group p3 acting on the moduli , ,  and on the u(1) eld strengths fi (see
ref.[3]). after passing to the string metric gs and performing the dimensional reduction
described in the previous section, the duality group o(3, z) becomes a symmetry of the 2d
eld equations (13)-(16). because the 4d action (1) is written in terms of the string metric
the duality transformation will act also on the 2d metric g and, owing to eq. (5), also on
the charge-vectors pi, qi. one can easily verify that the o(3,z) duality transformations leave
invariant the 2d dilaton eld , whereas in terms of the remaining 2d elds , , , g and
of the charge vectors pi, qi it is realized as follows:

the previous equations describe the action of the duality group on electric states (pi =
0), the action on magnetic states (qi = 0) can be easily obtained from eqs.
(22),(23),
by interchanging qi  pi. the duality group generated by the transformations (22),(23)

6

(22)

(23)

becomes extremely simple once we perform the single-scalar eld truncation described in
sect. 2. one can easily verify that the transformations t , u and the rst transformation in
eq. (23) change the ansatz (18) but not the resulting 2d action (19), (21). this fact has a
natural explanation. t , u and the rst duality in eq. (23) do not change the number n of
electric (or magnetic m) elementary constituents of a state, so that they cannot change the
2d action because the latter is parametrized in terms of n and m only. on the other hand,
using eqs. (18) into eqs. (22),(23), one nds that the remaining duality transformations
(in particular the s duality) act on the 2d dilaton gravity models (19) and (21) as weyl
transformations of the 2d metric,

g  ep g, p =

4

a2n

(m  m) ,

(24)

which map one into the other models in eqs. (19), (21) with the same value of n but with
a number m and m of magnetic elementary constituents.

acting at n xed, the weyl transformations (24) connect one with the other models
within a given multiplet. for instance, taking n = 2 we have three models: s(2, 2) ( = 4,
v () = 1, the cghs model), s(2, 1) ( = 0, v () = exp(2), the weyl-rescaled cghs
model of ref. [18] and s(2, 0) ( = 4, v () = exp(4)). these models are obtained one
from the other using the weyl transformations (24). g  e2g, maps s(2, 2)  s(2, 1)
and s(2, 1)  s(2, 0) whereas g  e4g maps s(2, 2)  s(2, 0).
the s duality is essentially an electro/magnetic duality, so that the strong/weak coupling
duality of the 4d theory (1) is translated, after dimensional reduction to two dimensions, at
least for the 4d model under consideration, into a dilaton-dependent weyl rescaling of the
2d metric.

it has been shown that dilaton-dependent weyl transformations leave invariant the phys-
ical parameters (the mass and for 2d black hole solutions, the hawking temperature and
radiation ux) associated with the solutions of 2d dilaton gravity [20]. also other physical
parameters that can be expressed in terms of the mass and the temperature (e.g the en-
tropy) are invariant under such transformations. the dimensional reduction seems to wash
out most of the information about the magnetic or electric character of the 4d solution. at
the 2d level the relevant information is encoded in the number n, the number of elemen-
tary constituents, the actual number of magnetic and electric elementary constituents being
irrelevant for the physical parameters of the solution. at the level of the 4d theory this
implies the equivalence of electrically and magnetically charged congurations, as long as
only excitations near extremality are concerned. moreover, in the 2d context, the duality
implies the equivalence of spacetime structure that behave rather dierently. 2d spacetimes
of constant curvature ( e.g the solutions of the 2d model s(3, 2)) are dual (i.e connected by
weyl transformations) to spacetimes with singularities (e.g the solutions of the 2d model
s(3, 1)).

presently, we do not know if this is a peculiarity of the 4d heterotic string theory (1)
or a general feature of 4d eective string theory. however, our results indicate that the
dimensionally reduced 2d theory takes care only of the relevant physical properties of the
4d model and can therefore be used to give a universal classication of the near-extremal
behavior of the 4d black hole solutions of string theory.

the results of the previous sections together with those of ref.

[12] can be used to
calculate, microscopically, the entropy of the near-extremal 4d, a = 1/3, black hole. the
near-extremal, near-horizon behavior of this black hole is described by the 2d model of eq.
(19) with n = 3, m = 2, i.e by the jt dilaton gravity model. for the jt black hole a
derivation of the statistical entropy has been given in ref. [12], one can, therefore, use it to
compute, microscopically, the entropy of the 4d, a = 1/3, black hole.
for a = 1/3 the single-scalar eld model of eq.(8) takes the form,
f 2(cid:27) ,

(25)
where the scalar eld  is connected to the 4d dilaton  trough  = 3 . as mentioned
above, this model arises as single-scalar eld, single u(1) eld strength truncation of the
n = 3 composite solutions of the action (1) and as compactication of the ve-dimensional
(5d) einstein-maxwell theory. the general (non extremal) black hole solution of the model
has the form [21],

if the 2d model (30) has to describe the near-extremal, near-horizon regime of the 4d black
hole solutions (26) then the 2d expression for the entropy (32) should match the leading
order of the corresponding 4d quantity in eq. (29). to show this, we rst write the 4d
solution (26) in terms of the string metric, we expand the solution near extremality and near
the horizon. after some manipulations we get

ds2 = (cid:16)2x2  (cid:17) dt2 +(cid:16)2x2  (cid:17)1
e2 = 2x.

dx2 + e20q2d2

(33)

where  = 1/(2q).

as expected the 4d solution factorizes as the product of a 2d spacetime and a two-sphere
of constant radius. taking into account that the dimensional reduction 4d  2d implies the
following relation between the 2d dilaton  and the 4d one :

e2 =

and comparing eq. (33) with eq. (31), we get

using eqs. (35) into the expression (29) for the 4d entropy and taking into account only the
leading term, we obtain a complete agreement with the 2d results, i.e s(4) = s(2).

until now we have considered only 4d, magnetically charged, solutions, i.e the state
s(3, 2). the 4d electrically charged solution s(3, 1) does not factorize as direct product of
two 2d spaces. near extremality it is described by the 2d model with n = 3, m = 1, which
is dual to the model (30). because the 2d entropy does not change under weyl rescaling of
the metric, it follows that the eqs. (32) and the equality s(4) = s(2) hold also for excitations
near 4d extremal, electrically charged, solutions.

we have shown that the semiclassical dynamics of small excitations near extremality of
the 4d black hole can be described by the 2d model (30) and that at the leading order,
the 2d and 4d thermodynamical entropy is the same. one can therefore use the results of
ref. [12] as an indirect calculation of the statistical entropy of the 4d black hole (26) in the
near-extremal regime.

in ref. [12] we have found a mismatch of a 2 factor between the thermodynamical and
the statistical entropy of the 2d black hole. this implies that also the statistical entropy of
the 4d a = 1/3 black hole agrees only up to a 2 factor with the thermodynamical result.
a simple explanation of this 2 factor could be found when the 2d ads black hole arises
as compactication of 3d one [12]. the same arguments of ref. [12] apply also in the case
under consideration because the 4d black hole solution (26) arises as compactication of the
solutions of 5d einstein-maxwell gravity that behave, near the horizon, as ads3  s2.

let us consider the 5d einstein-maxwell action,

[12] can be immediately translated to the

hence, the explanation of the 2 factor of ref.
case under consideration.
moreover, the expression (38) suggests that the discrepancy between thermodynamical
and statistical entropy of the 4d, a = 1/3, black hole could also have a geometrical expla-
nation. the 3d part of the metric (38) describes a spacetime that is ads3 with a conical
singularity.

5 conclusions

the dimensional reduction of 4d heterotic string theory presented in this paper has shown
once again that 2d dilaton gravity models can be used as a simplied description that retain
the relevant information about the 4d physics. the class of 2d dilaton gravity models we
have derived gives a general description of excitations near the extremal 4d heterotic black
hole. the geometrical structures, thermodynamical features and the duality symmetries of
the 4d theory become much simpler when translated in the 2d context.

particularly interesting are those 2d models that admit ads2 as solution. in this case
one can use the ads/cft duality to compute the statistical entropy of the near-extreme 4d
black hole. we have performed this calculation for the a = 1/3 black hole but in principle
the same should be possible for the a = 0 black hole. the near-horizon geometry factorizes

10

also for a = 0 as ads2  s2 and the excitations near extremality are now described by the
model (21). dierently from the a = 1/3 case, where we have a linear varying exp(2),
for a = 0 the dilaton is constant. a constant dilaton makes a black hole interpretation of the
solutions very dicult, at least from the 2d point of view. one cannot use the arguments of
ref. [12] to compute the statistical entropy of the black hole.

this diculties of the a = 0 case (actually the most interesting case from the string point
of view) are connected with a peculiarity, mentioned in the introduction, of the a = 0 case,
namely the existence of a mass gap separating the extremal conguration from the contin-
uous part of the spectrum. this implies that the nite-energy excitations near extremality
are suppressed [23]. probably, this behavior is related with other puzzling features of the
ads2/cft1 correspondence [23, 24, 12].
