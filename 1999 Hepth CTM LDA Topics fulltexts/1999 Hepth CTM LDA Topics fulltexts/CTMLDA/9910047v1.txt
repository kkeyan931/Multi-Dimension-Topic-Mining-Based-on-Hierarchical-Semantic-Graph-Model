abstract

we study the hybrid formulation of green-schwarz superstrings on ads3 with
ns ux and the boundary n = 4 superconformal algebra. we show the equivalence
between the nsr and gs superstrings by a eld redenition. the boundary n = 4
superconformal algebra is realized by the free elds of the ane lie superalgebra
a(1|1)(1). we also consider the light-cone gauge and obtain the n = 4 super-
liouville theory which describes the eective theory of the single long string near
the singularities of the d1-d5 system.

the duality between type iib superstrings on ads3  s3  m 4 (m 4 = k3 or t 4)
and two-dimensional n = 4 superconformal eld theory on the symmetric product of m 4

is an important example of the ads/cf t duality[1]. it also provides the microscopic

description of the black hole entropy [2]. the virasoro symmetry on the boundary of

ads3, which was rstly discovered by brown and henneaux [3], can be examined by

using various methods such as the liouville theory obtained from the sl(2, r) chern-

simons gravity with constraints [4] and the non-linear sigma models related to the d1-d5

system[5]. in particular, giveon kutasov and seiberg constructed the boundary virasoro

algebra from the conserved charges in the neveu-schwarz-ramond (nsr) superstring
theory on ads3  s3  t 4[6] (see also [7, 8, 9, 10]).

in this paper, we study the n = 4 superconformal algebra on the boundary of ads3

from the viewpoint of the covariantly quantized green-schwarz (gs) superstring theory.

the classical gs action on ten-dimensional at space [11] or ads spaces[12] is quite

dicult to quantize due to its non-linearity. on the other hand, the new (or hybrid)

formulation of the gs superstrings compactied on k3 manifolds or calabi-yau three-

folds, proposed by berkovitz and vafa (bv) [13], have manifest lorentz covariance and

is easy to quantize since the gs-like variables are expressed in terms of free elds. in a

recent paper[14], berkovitz, vafa and witten constructed the gs action in both the ns

and rr backgrounds, which is based on the non-linear sigma model on the lie supergroup
su(2|2).

one interesting property of the bv approach is that the gs action is equivalent to that

of the covariant nsr formalism by a eld redenition. we shall construct the explicit

operator map from the covariant nsr formalism to the gs formalism. the action is
shown to contain the ane lie superalgebra a(1|1)(1)(= sl(2|2)(1)). the superconformal
symmetry on the boundary of ads3 is realized by the wakimoto realization of the current

algebra which has been constructed in the previous paper[7].

as an application of this spacetime boundary superconformal algebra, we study the

eective theory of a long string separated from the d1-d5 system. seiberg and witten[16]

studied this system by taking the light-cone gauge[9] in the nsr formalism on ads3 and

showed that the bosonic sector of this system becomes the liouville theory. we will show

that the gs action leads to the n = 4 superconformal liouville theory. this theory would

1

be useful to investigate the eective theory describing the small instanton singularity of

the corresponding d1-d5 system.

we begin with the nsr superstrings on ads3  s3  m 4. here m 4 is k3 or t 4. we
then consider the correspondence between nsr and gs superstrings by a eld redenition.
let us consider the m 4 = t 4 case. the type iib superstrings on ads3  s3  t 4 in the
pure ns background is described in terms of n = 1 supersymmetric sl(2, r), su(2)
and u(1)4 wzw models with level k, which correspond to the ads3, s3 and t 4 part
respectively. we introduce fermionic ghosts (b, c) with conformal weights (2,1) and
bosonic ghosts (, ) with weights (3/2,1/2).

let j (z), j 3(z) be sl(2, r) currents at level k = k +2 and k (z) , k 3(z) the su(2)
currents at level k = k  2. a(z) and a(z) (a = , 3) are free fermions, which are
the superpartner of the currents j a(z) and k a(z), respectively. their operator product

expansions (opes) are given by

j 3(z)j 3(w) = 2k

obey the sl(2, r) and su(2) algebra at level k, respectively. the u(1)4 current algebras
are generated by the currents iy j(z) (j = 1, 2, 3, 4) and the free fermions j(z) with the

opes:

now we consider the spacetime supersymmetry in the nsr formalism[15]. to construct

the spacetime supercharges, it is convenient to bosonize the fermions:

(z) = eih1(z), (z) = eih2(z),

(3  i3) = eih3(z),

(1  i2) = eih4(z),

1
2
(3  i4) = eih5(z),

where hi(z) (i = 1,   , 5) are free bosons with opes hi(z)hj (w) = ij ln(zw)+   .
we also bosonize the ghost system (b, c) and (, ):

b = ei,

c = ei,

 = e,

 = e,

(8)

with opes (z)(w) =  ln(z  w) +   , (z)(w) =  ln(z  w) +    and (z)(z) =
1/(z  w) +   . the spacetime supercurrents in the (1/2)-picture take the form

(9)

(10)

p(z) = e/2s(z)

where

s(z) = e

i=1 i hi (z),

and i = 1. the 1, . . . , 5 obey the conditions q5
i=1 i = 1 [6]. the
supercharges are characterized by the sl(2, r) su(2) u(1) indices (1, 2, 4). 3 and
5 are determined by 3 = 12 and 5 = 4.

i=1 i = 1 and q3

we discuss the gs superstrings on ads3. in the bv construction[13], only half of the
spacetime supersymmetries is realized in the (1/2)-picture. these supercharges q1/2 
are written in the formr dzp(z), where p(z) are fermionic currents with conformal weight

one:

p+++++(z) = e/2+i/2(h1+h2+h3)+i/2(h4+h5),

p+++(z) = e/2+i/2(h1+h2h3)+i/2(h4+h5),

p+++(z) = e/2+i/2(h1h2h3)+i/2(h4+h5),

p+++(z) = e/2+i/2(h1h2+h3)+i/2(h4+h5).

(11)

let us introduce dual variables (z) to p(z) in (11):

+++++(z) = e/2i/2(h1+h2+h3)i/2(h4+h5),

3

+++(z) = e/2i/2(h1+h2h3)i/2(h4+h5),

+++(z) = e/2i/2(h1h2h3)i/2(h4+h5),

+++(z) = e/2i/2(h1h2+h3)i/2(h4+h5).

they satisfy

(14)

the pairs of elds (p(z), (z)) are fermionic system with weight (1, 0), which are fun-
damental elds in the bv construction.
in order to obtain the full system of the gs
superstrings, we need other three scalars, which are independent of (p, ). these are

given by

(h4  h5),
(h4 + h5  2 + 2i),

where we have introduced a scalar eld (z) by (, ) = (ei, ei). since the u(1) current

i(h4 + h5)(z) of t 4 is changed to 2i(z) = i(h4 + h5)(z) 2( + i)(z), the free
fermions i must be replaced by i, where

1
2

(1  i2) = ei(h4+i)(z),

1
2

(3  i4) = ei(h5+i)(z).

(15)

to summarize, the sl(2, r) and su(2) currents j a(z), k a(z) (a = , 3), the fermionic
ghosts (p(z), (z)), two free bosons (z), (z), n = 1 u(1)4 superconformal elds
(y i(z), i(z)) are fundamental elds in the gs action on ads3  s3  t 4.

for m 4 = k3 case, we may use the n = 4 superconfomal eld theory with cen-
tral charge c = 6 instead of (y i, i). we take an n = 2 superconformal subalgebra
(tk3, g

k3, jk3) by choosing the u(1) current jk3(z) = ihk3(z) where

jk3(z)jk3(w) =

c

(z  w)2 +    ,

(16)

with c = c/3 = 2. the spin operators (p, ) and the scalar eld  are obtained by
replacing h4 + h5 by hk3. the u(1) eld is shifted by the 2( + i) so that the
supercurrents g

k3 are modied as g

k3 = e(+i)g

k3.

we now discuss the spacetime superconformal symmetry on the boundary of ads3.

half of the spacetime supercharges are realized by the (-1/2)-picture supercharges q1/2 .
other supercharges are realized in the (+1/2)-picture. let us denote them as q

(19)

we study the subalgebra which does not depend on the term pei, although such terms

play an important role to construct the gs action in the rr background[14]. we may

5

show that the currents p(z), q(z), k ,3(z), j ,3(z) satisfy the ane lie superalgebra
sl(2|2)(1) at level k.

let us review the structure of the lie superalgebra sl(2|2)[17]. this algebra has the
simple roots i (i = 1, 2, 3), where 1 = e1  e2, 2 = e2  1, 3 = 1  2 and ea (a) are
the orthonormal basis with positive (negative) norm: ea  eb = ab (a  b = ab). sl(2|2)
has rank r = 2 since the algebra is obtained by taking the quotient by the one-dimensional

ideal generated by the identity matrix. an ane lie superalgebra with rank r is generated
by bosonic currents j(z) (  +
0 ), the cartan currents h i(z) (i = 1, . . . , r) and
fermionic currents j(z) (  +
1 ) denotes the set of positive even (odd)
roots. for sl(2|2), we have +
1 = {2, 1 + 2, 2 + 3, 1 + 2 + 3}.
the bosonic currents j1(z) and 1  h(z) obey the su(2) ane lie algebra at level k.
the currents j3(z) and 3  h(z) satisfy the sl(2, r) ane lie algebra at level k. the
pairs of fermionic currents (j(1+2)(z), j2(z)) and (j(1+2+3)(z), j(2+3)(z)) form

0 (+
0 = {1, 3} and +

1 ). here +

the doublets with respect to the su(2) subalgebra. we may identify the currents p(z),
q(z), k ,3(z), j ,3(z) in terms of the currents of sl(2|2)(1) as follows:

j2(z) = p+++++(z),

j12(z) = p+++(z),

j23(z) = p+++(z),

j123(z) = p+++(z),

j1+2+3(z) = q+++++(z),

j2+3(z) = q+++(z),

j1+2(z) = q+++(z),

j2(z) = q+++(z),

j1(z) = k +(z),
j3(z) = j +(z),

j1(z) = k (z), 1  h(z) = k 3(z),
j3(z) = j (z), 3  h(z) = j 3(z).

(20)

when we apply the wakimoto realization for the sl(2, r) and su(2) currents j ,3(z)
and k ,3(z), we obtain the free eld realization of the ane lie superalgebra sl(2|2)(1).
introduce the free bosons i(z) and two pairs of bosonic ghost system ( 1, 1) and
( 3, 3), whose conformal weights are (1, 0). their opes are given by

in terms of these free elds, the currents j and k are written as

1+2 = +++,

2+3 = p+++,
2+3 = +++,

1+2+3 = p+++,
1+2+3 = +++. (24)

this free eld realization is dierent from the one given in [7]. we nd that the relation

between two realizations is given by the formulae

1 = 1,

3 = 3,
2 = 2,

1 = 1 + 2 2+2 + 2+3 1+2+3,
3 = 3,

2 = 2 + 1 1+2,

1+2 = 1+2  1
2+3 = 2+3,

1+2+3,

1+2 = 1+2,

2+3 = 2+3 + 1 1+2+3,

1+2+3 = 1+2+3  1

1+2+3,

1+2+3 = 1+2+3,

(25)

where (, ) and (, ) are free elds used in [7]. in the previous work[7], we have
shown that the free eld realization of ane lie superalgebra sl(2|2)(1) leads to the space-
time n = 4 superconformal algebra on the boundary of ads3. by using the operator

map between the nsr and the gs strings, we can show that the boundary n = 4 su-

perconformal algebra constructed in the nsr formalism [6, 8] is equivalent to the algebra

in [7]. in the present paper, we examine the spacetime boundary superconformal algebra

by taking the light-cone gauge[9, 16]. in the light-cone gauge, the spacetime virasoro

algebra turns out to be the worldsheet one. the theory is expected to describe the eec-

tive theory of the single long string separated from the d1/d5 system[16]. we take the

7

following the light-cone gauge in (20):

3   = 0  1,
2+3 = z 2,

3 = z,

3 = z,
1+2+3 = z 1+2.

(26)

since the fermionic elds 1+2+3 and 2+3 are written in terms of other elds, we put
1+2+3 = 0 and 2+3 = 0. in order to study the spacetime conformal symmetry on

the boundary of ads3, we need to solve the constraint ttotal = 0, where the total energy-

momentum (em)tensor is dened by ttotal = tsl(2|2) + tm 4 + tghosts. tsl(2|2) denotes the
em tensor of the sl(2|2) wzw model. tm 4 is that of the conformal eld theory on m 4
and tghosts is constructed out of (, ) bosons. in the classical approximation, we may

ignore the ghost contribution. tsl(2|2) is then given by

let us consider the spacetime virasoro algebra in this light-cone gauge. the generator

ln(z) = zn+1( t + tm 4) +

zn(cid:16)i+3   + 2 2 + 1+2 1+2(cid:17) .

(30)

from (28), it is shown that ln takes of the form r dz

2i zn+1t (z), where t (z) = tn =4(z) +
tm 4(z) and tn =4(z) is the em tensor of the n = 4 su(2) extended superconformal
algebra with central charge c = 6(k  1):

we note that the em tensor (31) has no quantum correction though we treat the con-
straints in a classical way. in the light-cone gauge, the fermionic ghosts (1+2, 1+2)
and (2, 2) become the fermions with spin (1/2, 1/2) due to the twist in (30). adding
tm 4 with the central charge c = 6, the worldsheet total em tensor t (z) has the central

charge c = 6k as expected from the spacetime virasoro symmetry.

now we consider the space-time superconformal symmetry in the light-cone gauge. since

we have imposed the constraints 2+3 = 1+2+3 = 0, which break the half of space-

time supersymmetries, we expect to obtain half of generators of the n = 4 spacetime

superconformal algebra. the supercurrents of the spacetime n = 4 superconformal alge-

and the gs formulation of the superstrings on ads3 with pure ns background. the
latter formulation leads to the free eld realization of the sl(2|2) ane lie superlalgebra.
we have investigated the spacetime n = 4 superconformal algebra in the light-cone

gauge. in the classical approximation, we have obtained only half of the supercurrents

in the background (26). in order to get the quantum superconformal algebra the brst

approach is necessary[16].

as an application of the present formalism, it would be interesting to study the space-

time correlation functions of chiral primary elds. in order to compute them, we need to

investigate the bulk superstring theory[18], where we need to take into account the liou-

ville term in the action. we may examine this gs action on ads3 as the wzw model
on the su(2|2; c)/su(2|2), which provides a spacetime supersymmetric extension of the
euclidean ads3 = su(2, c)/su(2)[18]. an element of the lie supergroup su(2|2; c)
admits the decomposition:

where we put 

123 = 123 + 123. the cartan part i satisfy 1 + 2 = 0
and 3 + 4 = 0. then su(2|2) acts on su(2|2; c) by g  gh (h  su(2|2)). the
action of wzw model on su(2|2; c)/su(2|2) is dened by s = sw zw (gg), where

introducing the auxiliary elds i conjugate to i for i = 2, 12, 23, 123 and a to a

in order to obtain the free eld realization (20), we nd that i1   = 1  2, i3 
 = 3  4, ( a, a) = (a, a) (a = 1, 3) and (2, 2) = (2  1 12 + 3 23 
13 123, 2), (1+2, 1+2) = (12 + 3123, 12), (2+3, 2+3) = (23  1123, 23) and
(1+2+3, 1+2+3) = (123, 123). if we consider the quantum correction, the vertex op-
3e43 and e23(2112 + 32313123)(2 1 12 + 3 23
erators 1
13 123) become the screening operators, which commutes with the sl(2|2)(1) currents.
the remaining vertex operators, however, do not commute with the currents correspond-

1e21, 3

ing to the positive roots[19]. it is not clear at present how these non-screening operators

work for studying the spacetime correlation functions in the present gs formalism.

it is also interesting to generalize the present construction to other models with various
spacetime supersymmetries. for example, we may study the gs superstrings on ads3 
s3  s3  s1. the nsr formulation is discussed in [20].
in this case, we expect the
d(2|1; )(1) ane lie superalgebra to represent spacetime supersymmetry. the light-cone
gauge choice would lead to the linear subalgebra of the n = 4 su(2)su(2) non-linearly
extended superconformal algebra. another interesting example is the gs superstrings
with n < 4 spacetime supersymmetries[21]. for n = 2 case, we may study ads3 
s1  n /u(1), where n /u(1) denotes certain n = 2 superconformal kazama-suzuki
model. from this model, we obtain the non-critical superstrings with n = 2 spacetime

superconformal symmetry[22]. in this case, we expect that the ane lie superalgebra
sl(2|1)(1) [7] provides the corresponding gs superstrings. since one can introduce non-
trivial rr backgrounds in this formulation[14], it is possible to study the singular cft

resolved by non-trivial background [23]. these subjects will be discussed elsewhere.
