abstract: these lecture notes are a brief introduction to wess-zumino-witten models,
and their current algebras, the ane kac-moody algebras. after reviewing the general

background, we focus on the application of representation theory to the computation of
3-point functions and fusion rules.

1. introduction

in 1984, belavin, polyakov and zamolodchikov [1] showed how an innite-dimensional
eld theory problem could eectively be reduced to a nite problem, by the presence of

an innite-dimensional symmetry. the symmetry algebra was the virasoro algebra, or
two-dimensional conformal algebra, and the eld theories studied were examples of two-

dimensional conformal eld theories. the authors showed how to solve the minimal models
of conformal eld theory, so-called because they realise just the virasoro algebra, and they

do it in a minimal fashion. all elds in these models could be grouped into a discrete, nite
set of conformal families, each associated with a representation of the virasoro algebra.

this strategy has since been extended to a large class of conformal eld theories with
similar structure, the rational conformal eld theories (rcfts) [2]. the new feature is

that the theories realise innite-dimensional algebras that contain the virasoro algebra as
a subalgebra. the larger algebras are known as w -algebras [3] in the physics literature.

thus the study of conformal eld theory (in two dimensions) is intimately tied to innite-
dimensional algebras. the rigorous framework for such algebras is the subject of vertex
(operator) algebras [4] [5]. a related, more physical approach is called meromorphic con-

formal eld theory [6].

special among these innite-dimensional algebras are the ane kac-moody algebras (or
their enveloping algebras), realised in the wess-zumino-witten (wzw) models [7]. they

1

are the simplest innite-dimensional extensions of ordinary semi-simple lie algebras. much
is known about them, and so also about the wzw models. the ane kac-moody algebras

are the subject of these lecture notes, as are their applications in conformal eld theory.
for brevity we restrict consideration to the wzw models; the goal will be to indicate how
the ane kac-moody algebras allow the solution of wzw models, in the same way that

the virasoro algebra allows the solution of minimal models, and w -algebras the solution
of other rcfts. we will also give a couple of examples of remarkable mathematical

properties that nd an explanation in the wzw context.

one might think that focusing on the special examples of ane kac-moody algebras is

too restrictive a strategy. there are good counter-arguments to this criticism. ane kac-
moody algebras can tell us about many other rcfts: the coset construction [8] builds a
large class of new theories as dierences of wzw models, roughly speaking. hamiltonian

reduction [9] constructs w -algebras from the ane kac-moody algebras.
in addition,
many more conformal eld theories can be constructed from wzw and coset models by

the orbifold procedure [10] [11]. incidentally, all three constructions can be understood in
the context of gauged wzw models.

along the same lines, the question why study two-dimensional conformal eld theory?
arises. first, these eld theories are solvable non-perturbatively, and so are toy models
that hopefully prepare us to treat the non-perturbative regimes of physical eld theories.

being conformal, they also describe statistical systems at criticality [12]. conformal eld
theories have found application in condensed matter physics [13]. furthermore, they are

vital components of string theory [14], a candidate theory of quantum gravity, that also
provides a consistent framework for unication of all the forces.

the basic subject of these lecture notes is close to that of [15]. it is hoped, however,
that this contribution will complement that of gawedzki, since our emphases are quite
dierent.

the layout is as follows. section 2 is a brief introduction to the wzw model, including
its current algebra. ane kac-moody algebras are reviewed in section 3, where some

background on simple lie algebras is also provided. both sections 2 and 3 lay the founda-
tion for section 4: it discusses applications, especially 3-point functions and fusion rules.

we indicate how a priori surprising mathematical properties of the algebras nd a natural
framework in wzw models, and their duality as rational conformal eld theories.

2. wess-zumino-witten models

2.1. action

let g denote a compact connected lie group, and g its simple lie algebra1. suppose
 is a g-valued eld on the complex plane. the wess-zumino-witten (wzw) action is
written as [7][17]

sk() = 

k

8 z k(1, 1) d2x + 2k s() ,

(2.1)

where  = /x, the summation convention is used with euclidean metric, and k
denotes the killing form of g, which is nondegenerate for g simple,

k(x, y) =

tr(ad x ad y)

2h

, x, y  g .

(2.2)

here h is an integer xed by the algebra g, called the dual coxeter number of g, and
ad x(z) := [x, z]. the second term is the wess-zumino action. to describe it, imagine that
the complex plane (plus the point at ) is a large 2-sphere s2.  then maps s2 into the
group manifold of g.

s

g

figure 1. the map  : s2  g. b is the 3-dimensional solid ball with s2 as
its boundary, b = s2.

the homotopy groups n(g) thus enter consideration (see [18], for example). the
elements of n(g) are the equivalence classes of continuous maps of the n-sphere sn
into (the group manifold of) g. two such maps are equivalent if their images can be

continuously deformed into each other. if all images of sn in g are contractible to a point,
then the n-th homotopy group of g is trivial, n(g) = 0. a non-trivial n(g) indicates the
presence of non-contractible n-cycles in g. (a cycle is a n-dimensional submanifold without
boundary; a non-contractible one is also not a boundary itself.) so, homotopy is quite a
ne measure of the topology of a group manifold g. for example, n(g) = z implies there
is a non-contractible n-cycle cn in g that generates n(g), and a map sn  g can wind
around this cycle any number ( z) of times.

by a generalisation of stokes theorem, the existence of non-contractible cycles in g has
to do with the existence of harmonic n-forms on g. a harmonic form hn is a dierential
form that is closed (dhn = 0), but not exact (no form p exists such that hn = dp). recall
that if cn is a non-contractible cycle, its boundary vanishes (cn = 0), and cn is not a
boundary itself. in the case n(g) = z just mentioned, there exists a harmonic n-form hn
on g, that can be identied with the volume form on cn, and can be normalised so that
the volume of cn computed with it is 1: rcn

getting back to the wess-zumino term, since 2(g) = 0 for any compact connected lie
group,  can be extended to a map ( when we want to emphasise this) of b into g, where
b = s2. the wess-zumino action can be written as

hn = 1.

s() = 1

482 zb

ijk k(cid:18)1 

yi ,(cid:20)1 

yj , 1 

yk(cid:21)(cid:19) d3y

(2.3)

where yi (i = 1, 2, 3) denote the coordinates of b.

let ta denote the elements of a basis of g, i.e. g = span{ ta : a = 1, . . . , dim g }. for

hermitian ta, (ta) = ta, the commutation relations of g can be written as

[ta, tb] = xc

if abc tc

,

(2.4)

where the structure constants f abc are real. normalising so that k(ta, tb) = ab, we get

k(cid:0)ta, [tb, tc](cid:1) = i f abc .

(2.5)

since 1  
yi
the wess-zumino action.

is an element of g, we see by (2.3) that the structure constants f abc enter

now the totally antisymmetric structure constants f abc of g dene a harmonic 3-form
h3 on the group manifold of g. s is an integral over the pull-back of this harmonic 3-form
h3 to the space b:

h3 .

(2.6)

s()b := zb

h3 = z1s2

by the discussion of the previous paragraph, this points to a relation between the wess-
zumino term and the homotopy of g. this will be made explicit soon.

if the wzw action is to describe a local theory on s2, then the formal expression b =
1s2 should indicate that the physics is independent of which 3-dimensional extension
b of s2 is used. picture s2 as a circle, in order to draw a simple diagram.  : s2  g
can be depicted as in fig. 2.

(s  )

g

s2).

in fig. 3, the images by  of two dierent extensions b, b of s2 are pictured. in order

that the physics described by b is equivalent to that described by b, we require

or

exph2ik s()bi = exph2ik s()bi

exph2ik s()bbi = 1 .

(2.7)

(2.8)

(b  b) is homotopically equivalent to s3 (depicted as s2 in fig. 4).

now to the homotopic signicance of the wz term: s()s3 = n is the winding number
of the map  : s3  g. since 3(g) = z (for g any compact connected simple lie group),
we have n  z. therefore (2.8) requires k  z, and since k and k yield indistinguishable
physics, we use k  z0, which will be the so-called level of the ane kac-moody algebra
realised by the wzw model.

the quantisation of the wz term can also be understood by its relation to anomalies,
which have topological signicance (see [18], chapter 13, for example). consider rst a

( + a) = (z + a) + (z + a)  .

(2.9)

here z = x1 + ix2, z = x1  ix2, and  are the dirac (gamma) matrices, with anti-
commutation relations {, } = 2,. in the rst expression,  is a dirac spinor,  =
1, and a is the gauge potential. in the second, the chiral components  = (1+)/2,
 = (1  )/2 appear, where  := i12 is the chirality operator, and a = a1 + ia2,
a = a1  ia2. the lagrangian is invariant under the gauge transformations

a  u au 1 + u zu 1 ,   u  ;
  u  ,
a  u a u 1 + u z u 1 ,

6

(2.10)

g
g
where u and u are two independent elements of the gauge group g. this chiral g  g
gauge invariance is the result of the vector and axial-vector gauge invariance of the dirac
lagrangian: u = u species a vector gauge transformation, and when u = u 1, we get
an axial-vector transformation.

in a spacetime of n dimensions, a gauge boson has n  2 degrees of freedom. in n = 2,
what this means is that all a can be obtained by applying gauge transformations to some
xed a, 0, say. so we can parametrise

a = 1z ,

a = 1z ,

with ,   g. then, the gauge transformations (2.10) become

  u ,

   u .

(2.11)

(2.12)

equivalently, we can say that the elds a, a are subsidiary elds that could have been
eliminated in (2.9), giving a four-fermion interaction (and so a thirring model).

the path integral

z [d][d ] exp(cid:18)z l d2x(cid:19) = eseff

(2.13)

denes an eective action se from which the fermions have been eliminated. because of
the form of the lagrangian (2.9) in (2.13), one often writes

se = log det [( + a)] .

(2.14)

in simple cases, these path integrals can be computed explicitly.

suppose there are extra avour indices for the fermions, suppressed in (2.9), running over
a number nl of (avours of) left-handed fermions , and a number nr of right-handed
fermions . if nl 6= nr, the axial-vector gauge invariance is destroyed when quantum
corrections are taken into account. there is a chiral anomaly, proportional to nl nr. in
the path-integral formalism, this happens because the integration measure for the chiral

fermions cannot be regularised in a way that preserves the invariance [19].

following polyakov and wiegmann [20] (see also [21]), consider a fermionic model with

nl avours of left-handed fermions  and similarly nr right-handed fermions :

l = (z + a) + (z + a)  + vk(a, a) ,

(2.15)

where v is a constant.

7

first consider the case nl = nr = 1. in the gauge a = 0, integrating out the fermions

gives [20]

log det [( + a)] = s1() .

(2.16)

this contribution comes from the left-handed fermion .
in general gauge, one would
expect terms s1() + s1(1), the second term coming from the left-handed fermion .
this is not the complete answer, however, since by vector gauge invariance, we expect a
result that depends only on 1. this is where the k(a, a) term comes in. one nds
(2.17)

log det [( + a)] = s1(1) ,

and the constant v of (2.15) is adjusted so that

s1(1) = s1() + s1(1) 

1

4 z d2xk(cid:0)(1z), (1z)(cid:1) .

(2.18)

this is the polyakov-wiegmann identity. as well see, the ane current algebra of the

wzw model can be derived from it.

now suppose nl 6= nr, so that the theory has a chiral anomaly. eliminating fermions

gives

se (a, a) = nls1() + nrs1(1) 
(nl + nr)(cid:2) s1() + s1(1)(cid:3) +

8f z d2xk(1, 1) ,



(2.19)

where f is a constant, related to v. it is not xed by gauge invariance here. now take the
limit nl + nr  , with nl  nr xed. the term 1
forced to vanish. this implies pure gauge a, a: a = 1z, a = 1z (compare to
(2.11)). so we have

2 (nl + nr)(cid:2) s1() + s1(1)(cid:3) is

se = 

1

8f z d2xk(1, 1) + 2k s() ,

(2.20)

with k = nl nr. from this point of view then, k is quantised because it is the dierence
in the number of left-handed and right-handed fermions.

this last action is not quite that of the wzw model, with f being an arbitrary constant.
its that of a (two-dimensional) principal chiral -model, with wz term. such a sigma

model is asymptotically free, as is the -model without the wz term. without the wz
term, the sigma model is strongly interacting in the infrared. but with the wz term present
in the action, there is an infrared xed point, at 1
f = k. the wzw model describes the
dynamics of this xed point. well remain at 1

f = k henceforth.

2.2. current algebra

lets rewrite the polyakov-wiegmann identity (2.18) as

sk() = sk() + sk() + ck(, ) ,

(2.21)

putting  = 1, and using sk() = ks1(), and

ck(, ) = k c1(, ) = 

k

4 z d2xk(cid:0)(1z), (z1)(cid:1) .

(2.22)

the term ck(, ) is a cocycle:

ck(, ) + ck(, ) = ck(, ) + ck(, ) .

(2.23)

the presence of this cocycle indicates a projective representation, of the loop group lg of

g [22]. alternatively, we can say that the group dlg, an extension of lg, is represented
non-projectively. this extension dlg has as its lie algebra the (untwisted) ane kac-
moody algebra g, the central extension of the loop algebra of g. well call g an ane
algebra, for short. lets see how the wzw model realises g g as a current algebra [7][23].
then conformal invariance can be established.

since

ck(, 1) = 

k

4 z d2xk(cid:0)1z, 1z (cid:1) ,

(2.24)

if either z = 0 or z  = 0, then ck(, 1) = 0, and also sk() = sk( ) = 0. (2.21)
thus establishes the local g  g invariance of the wzw model:
sk(cid:0)(z)(z, z) 1(z)(cid:1) = sk ((z, z)) ,

(2.25)

sometimes called the g(z)  g(z) invariance.

for innitesimal transformations  = id + (z), (z) = id + (z), the wzw eld 

transforms as

  = ,

  =   .

with  =  + , we nd

sk() = 

k

 z d2x (cid:8)k(cid:0), z(z1)(cid:1)  k(cid:0), z(1z)(cid:1)(cid:9) .

the equations of motion of the wzw model are

(1) + i (1) = 0 .

9

(2.26)

(2.27)

(2.28)

switching to the complex coordinates z, z, and using z = 2z, z z = i/2, etc., these give
z(1z) = 0, with hermitian conjugate z(z1) = 0. dening

we have

j := kz1 ,

j := k1z ,

zj = 0 ,

z j = 0 .

(2.29)

(2.30)

so the currents j, j are purely holomorphic, antiholomorphic, respectively; i.e. j = j(z),
j = j(z). these currents will realise two copies of the ane algebra g.

first we must explain the quantisation scheme. we consider the euclidean time direction
to be the radial direction, so that constant time surfaces are circles centred on the origin.

more explicitly, the (conformal) transformation

z = e +i , z = e i

(2.31)

maps the complex plane (punctured at z = 0, ) to a cylinder, with euclidean time
coordinate   r running along its length, and a periodic space coordinate    + 2.
the origin z = 0 then corresponds to the distant past  = , and the distant future
 = + is at |z| = .

this is called radial quantisation. in (3+1)-dimensional qft the n-point functions are
vacuum-expectation-values of time-ordered products of elds. similarly, in radial quanti-

sation one needs to consider radially-ordered products of elds:

r ( a(z)b(w) ) := (cid:26) a(z)b(w) ,

b(w)a(z) ,

|z| > |w| ,
|z| < |w| .

(2.32)

dene the correlation functions as vacuum-expectation-values of radially ordered products
of elds, i.e.

ha(z)b(w)i := h0| r (a(z)b(w)) |0i .

we make the operator product expansion

r (a(z)b(w)) =

xn=n0

(z  w)nd(n)(w) ,

(n0  0) .

(2.33)

(2.34)

we are also assuming n0 < , i.e. that there is no essential singularity at z = w. break
this product up by dening the contraction

a(z)b(w) :=

1xn=n0

10

(z  w)nd(n)(w)

(2.35)

or singular part, and the normal-ordered product

n (a(z)b(w)) := xn0

(z  w)n d(n)(w) .

n (ab) (w) := d(0)(w) ,

if we also dene

then we can write

r (a(z)b(w)) = a(z)b(w) + n (a(z)b(w))

(2.36)

(2.37)

(2.38)

= a(z)b(w) + n (ab) (w) + o(z  w) .

radial ordering will be assumed henceforth. often it is only the singular parts of operator

product expansions (opes) that are relevant. we write

a(z)b(w) 

1xn=n0

(z  w)nd(n)(w) = a(z)b(w) ,

(2.39)

i.e.  indicates that only the singular terms are written.

to show that the currents realise two copies of g, we integrate the right hand side of

(2.27) by parts, using counter-clockwise integration contours, to get

i

4 i0

dz k ( (z), j(z)) 

i

4 i0

dz k(cid:0) (z), j(z)(cid:1) .

(2.40)

(hw dz will indicate integration around a contour enclosing the point z = w.) expanding
 =pa ata, j =pa j ata, (and , j similarly), using k(ta, tb) = ab, we get

2ii0
sk() = 1

2ii0

dz xa

a j a .

(2.41)

this transformation rule leads to the g  g current algebra. in the euclidean path integral
formulation, a correlation function of the product x of elds is given by

hxi = r [d] x es[]
r [d] es[]

,

(2.42)

where [d] indicates path integration over the elds  of the theory.

if the action s

transforms with s = h0 dz s(z), then
hxi = i0

11

dz h(s)xi .

(2.43)

so (2.41) implies

hxi =

1

2ii0

dz xa

a(z) hj a(z)xi ,

(2.44)

where we have put  = 0 for simplicity. put x = j b(w). with j(w) = k(z)1 and
 = , we get

more explicitly this is

j = [, j]  kw .

j b(w) = xc,d

if bcdc(w)j d(w)  kwb(w) .

in (2.44) this gives

two currents:

(2.48)

a similar ope holds for the currents j a(z). this ope is equivalent to an ane algebra.

where here radial ordering is not implicit in the operator products. both operator products

(2.53)

identical commutation relations hold for the current modes j a
m.

these are the commutation relations of g  g. it is easy to see that (2.53) is a central
extension of the loop algebra of g. consider j a  sn, with s on the unit circle in the
complex plane, and n  z. the loop algebra of g is generated by the j a  sn, since they
are g-valued functions on s1 (the loop). now

[j a  sm, j b  sn] = [j a, j b]  sm+n = if abcj c  sm+n .

(2.54)

so only the central extension term ( k) is missing.

the central extension term is known as a schwinger term. (2.48) is not the usual form
in quantum eld theory, because radial quantisation is not typical. if we switch variables

using z = exp(2ix/l), then laurent series become fourier series, and we recover the
more familiar form

[ j a(x), j b(y)] = if abc j c(x)(x  y) +

1
2

abk(x  y) ,

(2.55)

13

where we have put j(x) := zj a(z)/l. the schwinger term is a quantum eect (as powers
of  would show) and is related to chiral anomalies, as the presence of k suggests (recall
that k = nlnr in the derivation of the wzw model as an eective theory with fermions
integrated out).2

the conformal invariance of the model can now be established in a straightforward

way. the sugawara construction expresses the stress-energy tensor in terms of normal-
ordered products of currents j a(z). the normal-ordered product (2.36) of two operators
x(w), y (w) can be rewritten as

n (xy )(w) =

1

2i iw

dz
z  w

x(z)y (w) .

(2.56)

with this form of normal ordering, the appropriate version of wicks theorem is

x(z) n (y z)(w) =

1

2iiw

using this we calculate

dx

x  wn x(z)y (x) z(w)

+ y (x) x(z)z(w)o .

j a(z) xb

n (j b j b)(w) = 2(k + h)

j a(w)

(z  w)2 ,

using (2.48). here h =pa,b,c f abcf abc/(2dim g) is the dual coxeter number of g (this is

consistent with (2.2), (2.4), (2.5)). so

xb

n (j b j b)(z) j a(w) = 2(k + h)(cid:26) j a(w)

(2.59)

the sugawara stress-energy tensor is

t (z) =

(2.62)

this last result is the conformal algebra with central extension, or virasoro algebra, in

ope form. so conformal invariance is established. substituting t (z) = pnz z2nln

which corresponds to

[lm, j a

(2.64)

(2.65)

this shows that g and v ir extend to a semi-direct product in the theory. furthermore, the
full chiral algebra of the wzw model is v ir  g, with commutation relations (2.63),(2.53)

and (2.65).

2.3. factorisation and primary elds

a factorised form for (z, z) solves the classical equation of motion:

(z, z) = l(z)r(z)  z(cid:0)1z(cid:1) = 0 .

(2.66)

this factorisation survives in the following form in the quantum theory. as already men-
tioned, under an innitesimal g(z)  g(z) transformation, we have

 =  ,

 =   .

(2.67)

the currents j a(z), j a(z) generate the innitesimal transformations of the elds, so we
have

j a(z)(w, w)  1
z  w
j a(z)(w, w) 
z  w

(w, w)ta

(2.68)

where ta

 is the g-generator ta in the representation appropriate to (z, z).

15

the wzw model also contains other elds, besides (z, z), that transform in similar

fashion. these are the so-called primary elds ,(z, z):

j a(z),(w, w)  1

(2.70)

(2.71)

this implies that the primary eld , transforms as a highest-weight representation l()
of the ane algebra g. similar considerations work for the right action, so , transforms
as l()  l().3

for most purposes, it suces to consider only the left or right action of g. so we will

write, instead of (2.69),

j a(z)(w)  ta

(w)
z  w

,

(2.72)

and similarly for j a(z) and (z),
if need be. we must emphasise, however, that
(z), (z) are not sensible local elds; they are only the holomorphic (left-moving)
and antiholomorphic (right-moving) parts of the primary eld ,(z, z).
if you like,
,(z, z) = (z) (z).

to see this, rst note that the primary eld ,(z, z) transforms nicely under conformal
transformations. thats because of the sugawara construction (2.60), expressing the stress-

energy tensor as a normal-ordered product of the currents. in terms of modes, the sugawara
construction gives

(2.77)

(2.78)

now, the generator of innitesimal scaling is l0 + l0, as well show below. so h + h
is the scaling dimension of the primary eld ,. (in radial quantisation, scaling = time-
translation, so the hamiltonian h = l0 + l0.) l0 l0 generates rotations, so that hh
is the spin of ,. for a single-valued (local) eld, we therefore require h  h  z. this
is a highly nontrivial constraint on pairs (, ), since h, h  q. it is in this sense that
(z) cannot be considered a sensible local eld in its own right.

the elds , are primary because all others are in the span of operator products of

currents acting on them:

j a1 (z1)j a2 (z2)    j an(zn) j a1(z1)j a2 (z2)    j an (zn) ,(z, z) .

(2.79)

they are therefore called descendant elds. more usually, the basis elements are written
as

we can also consistently write

in terms of |vi, the primary-eld conditions read

n|vi = 0 (n > 0) ,

(2.83)

(2.84)

(2.85)

in agreement with (2.75). the ane algebras are examples of triangularisable algebras

(just like the simple lie algebras) [25]. this means their generators can be written as a
disjoint sum of three sets, with corresponding decomposition

g = g  g0  g+ .

(2.86)

g0 is the cartan subalgebra, while g  g0 are borel subalgebras. g+(g) correspond to
positive (negative) roots, and so contain raising (lowering) operators. now, in the basis
used, g+ is generated by {j a
0 } contains the raising operators of
g  g. but since ta
 are the generators of g in a representation l() of highest weight ,
we know g+|vi = 0. so by (2.85), g+|vi = 0, i.e. |vi is the highest-weight state (highest
state/vector) of the ane representation l() of g.

the rest of the states in the representation l() can be obtained as descendant states,

i.e. as linear combinations of states of the form

n1    j an

nn (0)|0i .

(2.87)

now, there is still an innite number of possible highest weights. but well nd that for
xed k  z>0, only a nite number of inequivalent highest weights are possible. these
are the (unitary) integrable highest weights; they generate representations of g that can be
integrated to representations of dlg. by the g(z)  g(z) invariance of the wzw model,

these representations are precisely the relevant ones. we will arrive at this result from an

algebraic perspective, however.

to do this, we rst need to discuss g, g and their relation. this justies an interesting

digression on kac-moody algebras [26] [27] [28] [29].

18

3. ane kac-moody algebras

3.1. kac-moody algebras: simple lie algebras

g, g are examples of kac-moody algebras, which can be presented in terms of a cartan
matrix a = (ai,j), with integer entries (i.e. kac-moody algebras are generalised cartan
matrix lie algebras). lets rst dene g this way. if x is generated by x1 and x2, for
example, we use the notation x = hx1, x2i.

recall g = g+  g0  g. now
g+ = hei

: i = 1, . . . , ri ,

(3.1)

: i = 1, . . . , ri , g0 = hhi
i = 1, . . . , r} are the chevalley generators of
where r is the rank of g, and {ei, hi, fi
g. the commutation relations of the generators can be expressed in terms of the cartan
matrix:

: i = 1, . . . , ri , g = hfi

:

[hi, hj] = 0

[hi, ej] = aj,iej
[hi, fj] =  aj,ifj
[ei, fj] = i,jhj .

the chevalley presentation of the algebra g is completed by the serre relations:

[ad (ei)]1aj,i ej = 0 ,
[ad (fi)]1aj,i fj = 0 .

(3.2)

(3.3)

the r  r cartan matrix has diagonal entries ai,i = 2, so that hei, hi, fii = s(2) for all
i = 1, . . . , r. for simple g, g 6= r
i=1s(2), so ai,j 6= 0 for at least one pair i 6= j, if r > 1.
for all kac-moody algebras (including semi-simple lie, ane, hyperbolic, etc. algebras)4,
in
ai,i = 2 i, as just mentioned; ai,j  z0  i 6= j; and ai,j = 0  aj,i = 0.
addition, the cartan matrices are symmetrisable: there exist positive rational numbers qj
such that ad is a symmetric matrix, where d = diag(qj).

for g a semi-simple lie algebra, ai,j  {0, 1, 2, 3} for i 6= j, and most importantly,
det a > 0, i.e. the cartan matrix is invertible. for simple g, a must be indecomposable.

the information contained in the cartan matrix can be encoded in a so-called (coxeter-
)dynkin diagram. r nodes are drawn, each associated with a row (or column) of a. node
i and node j (j 6= i) are joined by a number ai,jaj,i of lines; and if ai,j 6= aj,i, so that

figure 6. the (coxeter-)dynkin diagrams of the simple lie algebras.

there are more than one lines, an arrow is drawn from node i to node j if |ai,j| > |aj,i|.
the coxeter-dynkin diagrams of the simple lie algebras are drawn in figure 6.

a more direct signicance, in terms of the roots of the algebra, can be given to the cartan

matrix and coxeter-dynkin diagrams. as we do this, well introduce another presentation
of g, the cartan-weyl presentation.

first, nd a maximal set of commuting hermitian generators h i, (i = 1, . . . , r):

[h i, h j] = 0 (1  i, j  r) .

(3.4)

any two such maximal abelian subalgebras g0 (cartan subalgebras) are conjugate under
the action of exp g (the covering group of a group with lie algebra g). fix a choice of
cartan subalgebra g0.

since the h i mutually commute, they can be diagonalised simultaneously in any repre-
sentation of g. the states of such a representation are then eigenstates of the h i, 1  i  r.

20

we write

h i |; i = i |; i .

(3.5)

here  is called a weight vector (or just a weight), with r components i. the corresponding
r-dimensional space is known as weight space. as well discuss shortly, it is dual to the
cartan subalgebra g0. the  of the kets |; i is meant to indicate any additional labels.

a basis for the whole of g can be constructed by appending {e}, obeying

[h i, e] = ie (1  i  r) .

(3.6)

 is a r-dimensional vector, called a root, and e is a step operator (raising or lowering
operator, depending). for simple lie algebras, e is determined by , up to normalisation.
if  is a non-zero root, the only multiple of  that is also a root is , and we can take
(3.7)

.

e = (cid:0)e(cid:1)

the set of roots of g will be denoted .

to complete the presentation of g in the cartan-weyl basis, we also need:

[e, e] = 


n (, )e+
2  h/2

0

if  +   
if  +  = 0
otherwise

(3.8)

where   h means pr

i=1 ih i =: h , 2 := (, ) (see below), and the n (, ) are
constants.5 here we use the scalar product (, ), dened through the killing form (2.2):

(, ) = k(h , h ) = tr(cid:0)ad (h ), ad (h )(cid:1)/2h .

(3.9)

this completes the cartan-weyl presentation of g.

0, weight space: for every weight   g

the killing form also establishes an isomorphism between the cartan subalgebra g0 and
its dual g
0, there corresponds an element h   g0
by () = k(h , ) (i.e. (h ) = k(h , h ) = (, ) for   ). this inner product can
be extended, by symmetry, (, ) = (, ), to all weights ,   g
0. by (3.8), the rescaled
root 2/2 has importance; it is called the coroot .

if we choose a xed basis for the root lattice ( weight lattice), we call  positive,
  +, i its rst nonzero component in this basis is positive. otherwise,   , i.e. 
is a negative root. e is considered a raising (lowering) operator if   + (  ).
5 (3.7) implies n (, ) = n (, ). then for  +    with p    q, we can set
n (, )2 = q(1  p)(, )/2.

21

a simple root is a positive root that cannot be written as a linear z0-combination of
: i = 1, . . . , r}. the
i = 1, . . . , r}. the basis dual to  is the dynkin

other positive roots. the set of simple roots will be denoted  = {i
set of simple coroots is  = {
basis of fundamental weights:

:

i

(cid:0)(cid:1)

= {i

: j = 1, . . . , r } .

(3.10)

that is, (i, 

j ) = i
j.

let us now compare the chevalley and cartan-weyl presentations of g. the chevalley
presentation emphasises the r subalgebras of type s(2) = a1 that are associated with
each simple root (or fundamental weight). it is the more economical presentation, since
it is written in terms of just 3r generators, those listed in (3.1). this economy allowed
it was natural to wonder whether loosening
the discovery of the kac-moody algebras:

the constraints on the cartan matrix would lead to other interesting types of algebras.
the price to be paid is the imposition of the more complicated serre relations (3.3). but

these relations are what ensure that (among other things) a nite-dimensional algebra is
generated.

in contrast, the cartan-weyl presentation makes use of the a1-subalgebras associated
with every positive root. for every positive root we get a raising and lowering operator,
and the nite-dimensionality of the algebra is built in. of course, the cost is the use of

more generators, a total of dim g of them.

more concretely, it is not dicult to make the identications

ei = ei ,

fi = ei ,

hi =

2i  h

2
i

= 

i  h ,

(3.11)

where h =pr

i=1 ihi, and nally

ai,j =

2(cid:0)i, j(cid:1)

2
j

= (i, 

j ) .

(3.12)

so, the cartan matrix encodes the scalar products of simple roots with simple coroots.

now, det a > 0 guarantees that weight space is euclidean. consider the hyperplanes in
i=1 ii

weight space with normals i. the primitive reection ri = ri of a weight  =pr

across such a hyperplane is given by

ri = ri =   (, 

i )i .

(3.13)

22

being reections, the ri have order 2, and they generate a coxeter group w , which can be
presented as

with the relations

w = h ri

: i = 1, . . . , r i ,

(rirj)mij = id .

(3.14)

(3.15)

clearly, mii = 1 for all i, and it turns out that all mij  {2, 3, 4, 6}, when i 6= j. this
coxeter presentation can be encoded in a coxeter diagram: nodes are drawn for each
primitive reection, and {0, 1, 2, 3} lines between nodes for mij  {2, 3, 4, 6}, respectively
(i 6= j). for simple g, we nd the coxeter diagrams are just the corresponding dynkin
diagrams (see fig. 6), with the arrows omitted. in fact, the coxeter group so obtained is
the weyl group of g.

the possible weights of integrable representations will lie on the weight lattice p :=
z(), the points in weight space that are integer linear combinations of the fundamental
weights. of course, this lattice is periodic and lls weight space. so we can think of it
as an innite crystal. it has a point group isomorphic to the weyl group, which explains
the restriction mij  {2, 3, 4, 6}, familiar from crystallography.

still, it is remarkable that these coxeter-weyl groups almost determine the algebra g
completely. more accurately (br and cr have isomorphic weyl groups), the simple lie
algebras are essentially those whose weight lattices can exist in a euclidean weight space
of dimension equal to the rank.

what is the geometry of the weyl hyperplanes in weight space? there is a weyl hy-
perplane for each root, not just for the simple roots, and they partition the r-dimensional

weight space into a nite number of sectors. each sector is of innite hypervolume, and
w acts simply transitively on them. the example of g = a2 is pictured in fig. 7.

we use the notation  = pr
i=1 i i = (1, . . . , r), and l(1, . . . , r) = l(). fig. 8
is the weight diagram for the a2 representation l(2, 1). notice it is symmetric under the
action of the weyl group w = s3 for a2. let mult (; ) denote the multiplicity of a
weight  in the representation l(). then this weyl symmetry can be written as

mult (; ) = mult (; w) , w  w .

(3.16)

the weyl symmetry can also be expressed in terms of characters. characters are to

representations what weights are to states (vectors). they are simpler than the represen-
tations themselves, yet still contain sucient information to be useful in many contexts.

precisely, the formal character of the g-representation l() is

ch := trl() eh .

we can write

(3.18)

(3.19)

in (3.17) and (3.19), eh and e are formal exponentials, with the additive property ee =
e+, for example.

the weyl symmetry is made manifest in the celebrated weyl character formula:

ch = pww (det w) ew.
(1  e)

q+

,

(3.20)

where the shifted weyl action is w. := w( + )  . here det w = 1 if w can be written
as a composition of an even number of primitive reections, and det w = 1 for an odd
number.

since the character of the singlet representation l(0) is ch0 = 1, (3.20) gives the denom-

inator identity

y+

(1  e) = xww

(det w) ew.0 .

(3.21)

so the weyl character formula can also be written as

ch = pww (det w) ew(+)
pww (det w) ew

.

(3.22)

if we continue this relation to weights  6 p+, we can also derive

ch = (det w) chw. .

(3.23)

this relation will be important later.

we can informalise the formal character in the following way:

ch() := xp ()

mult (; ) e(,)

.

(3.24)

the character ch() is then a polynomial in the r indeterminates ej , j = 1, . . . , r.

25

3.2. kac-moody algebras: ane algebras

as discussed above, the ane algebras g relevant to wzw models are central extensions
of the loop algebras of g, for g semi-simple; we restrict to g simple here for simplicity.
they are known as untwisted ane algebras. for such g, g  g is known as the horizontal
subalgebra of g.

the chevalley presentation for g is identical to that for g except that the r  r cartan
matrix a = (ai,j) is replaced by the (r + 1) (r + 1) cartan matrix a = ( ai,j)i,j{0,1,...,r},
with ai,j = ai,j for i, j 6= 0. as for g, the elements of the cartan matrix are determined
by scalar products of simple roots and coroots:

ai,j = ( i, 

j ) .

(3.25)

because of this structure, there is an intimate relation between the simple roots of g and
those of g.

an ane kac-moody cartan matrix obeys all the conditions mentioned above that the
simple lie algebras obey, except that the det a > 0 condition is loosened. let a(i) denote
the submatrix of (r + 1)  (r + 1) matrix a obtained by deleting the i-th row and column.
then we must have

det a = 0 , but det a(i) > 0 i  {0, 1, . . . , r} ,

(3.26)

if a is to be an ane cartan matrix. this means that the submatrices a(i) must be cartan
matrices for semi-simple lie algebras. besides the untwisted ane algebras, twisted ane

algebras also exist, but they are not so directly useful in conformal eld theory.

(3.26) guarantees that a has no negative eigenvalues, and exactly one zero eigenvector.
for all ane cartan matrices a, there exist positive integers a0, a1, . . . , ar, called marks,
i=0 ai ai,j = 0. if a is ane, meaning it is the cartan matrix of an ane
algebra, then so is at (their dynkin diagrams are obtained from each other by reversing

figure 9. the (coxeter-)dynkin diagrams of the ane untwisted kac-moody
algebras.

notice that if any node of any of the dynkin diagrams of fig. 9 is omitted, one obtains

27

the dynkin diagram of a semi-simple lie algebra. this is also true of the twisted ane
dynkin diagrams (not drawn here), and is in agreement with the condition (3.26). it is only

the untwisted dynkin diagrams, however, that are isomorphic to the extended diagrams
of simple lie algebras.

before making this precise, we must introduce another operator. for an arbitrary

symmetrisable kac-moody algebra, one can dene the inner product of simple roots di-
rectly from the cartan matrix a by (i, j) = ai,jqj ( recall ad is symmetric, with
d = diag(qi) ). this inner product is positive (semi-)denite i a is of (ane) nite type.
now, many of the important results for g are obtained as straightforward generalisations
of those for g, but these latter rely on having a non-degenerate bilinear form (, ). to
make the bilinear form non-degenerate in the ane case, one needs to enlarge the cartan
subalgebra g0 of g, to ge
0, by adding a derivation d. we will denote the enlarged ane

showing that k is indeed central. actually, the coecient k of the wz term (2.3) in the
wzw action (2.1) is to be identied with the eigenvalue of k, which is xed in the current
algebra of a given wzw model.

if we extend the bilinear form by choosing k(k, d) = 1, k(k, k) = k(d, d) = 0, the
resulting form is non-degenerate. the operator d is very natural in wzw models: d will
be identied with the virasoro zero mode l0.

if a step operator e  is an element of g, with

[ h i, e ] = ie 
[k, e ] = 0 ,

(i  {1, . . . , r}) ,
[d, e ] = n ,

(3.31)

we denote  = (, 0, n), and write e  =: e
n . so one can think of ane roots as vectors
with r + 2 components, r of which describe a root of g, and the other two correspond to
the elements k, d  ge. the inner product on ge

is

the ane simple roots are

0 = (, 0, 1) ,

i6=0 = (i, 0, 0) .

(3.34)

this explains why the extended dynkin diagram of g is identical to the dynkin diagram

for g.

the fundamental weights are

0 = (0, 1, 0) = (0, a

0 , 0) ,

i6=0 = (i6=0, a

i6=0, 0) .

(3.35)

for an arbitrary ane weight  = (, , n),  is called the level of the weight, and n is
called its grade. in the wzw context, the level of weight vectors will usually be xed by

the wz coecient k, and the grade is directly related to the eigenvalue of the virasoro
zero mode l0. for  as just written, we will adopt the notational convention that  = ;
if the hat is removed from an ane weight, the result is the horizontal projection, or
nite part of it. this is consistent with (3.34) and (3.35), and also allows us to write
0 = 0, 0 = , for examples. we also use  to denote  (and have so already); so
that k 0 = 0, for instance.

this notational convention also allows us to write

i = i ,

 i  {1, . . . , r} .

(3.36)

these are the ane roots and weights. what about the ane weyl group w ? it is also
the coxeter group associated with the corresponding dynkin diagram, generated by the
primitive weyl reections

suppose  = (, k, n), then this gives

ri =   (, 

i )

.

ri = (ri, k, n) ,

i 6= 0 ;

r0 =  (cid:2)k  (, )(cid:3) 0 = (cid:0)  +(cid:2) k  (, )(cid:3) , k, n (cid:2) k  (, )(cid:3)(cid:1) .

29

(3.37)

(3.38)

notice that k  (, ) plays the role of 0. this is justied by (, ) = pr
0 +pr
consequently, we sometimes use 0 := k  (, ). so (3.36) can be extended to include

i i = 0 + (, ), which should be the eigenvalue of k, i.e. the level.

i = 0, once the level k of an ane weight has been xed, as it is in wzw models.

the relation between w and w  w is found by calculating r  for  = (, 0, m). one

gets r  = r(t)m, where

t = (cid:0)  + k, k, n + 2  ( + k)2/2k(cid:1) .

(3.39)

tt = tt, so hti = tkq , the translation group in the (scaled) co-root lattice q of g.
furthermore, rtr1

 = rtr = tr (), so tkq is a normal subgroup of w , and

w = w  tkq .

(3.40)

this relation has important implications for the modular properties of ane characters,

as well see.

the geometry of ane weyl hyperplanes can be compared to that for the weyl hy-
perplanes of g, at least after the horizontal projection  = (, k, n) 7 . the situation
is analogous, with sectors of weight space labelled by elements of w . but this time the
sectors are of nite volume, and there is an innite number of them, since | w| = . see
fig. 10 for a depiction of the case g = a2.

this fact is highly suggestive: the integrable highest weights for g are those integral
weights ( =pr
i=1 ii with all i  z) contained in the sector labelled by id  w , so we
expect the integrable ane highest weights to be nite in number. how does this happen?
first, if  = (, k, n) is to be a highest weight for an integrable representation of g,
then g  g implies  must be one for g. so   p+ = { = pr
i=1 ii
: i 
z0}, ensuring that each a1 subalgebra hei, hi, fii = hei
i (i  {1, . . . , r}) is
represented integrably, i.e. has i = 2j with isospin j  z0/2. the extra condition
is simply that the a1 subalgebra corresponding to the simple root 0 be represented
integrably. this just means 0  z0 is required, i.e. k  (, ) = k pr
i  z0.

integrability is signalled by the presence of null vectors, vectors (states) of zero norm.
for example, with g = a1, and highest state |vi with  = 11 = 2j1, one nds the null
states e1|vi (from the highest-state condition) and f 1+1
|vi. see fig. 11
for the example of j = 3/2, i.e. the a1 representation l(3). the existence of null vectors
(and so integrability) goes hand-in-hand with the weyl symmetry of representations.

|vi = f 2j+1

for the integrable highest-weight representations of g, with highest weight state satisfy-
ing ei|vi = 0 for all i  {0, 1, . . . , r}, there are r+1 primitive null vectors |ii := f 1+i
|vi.
primitive here means that all other null vectors (an innite number of them) can be ob-

i

tained as descendants of these ones. because of (3.34), these are of exactly the same form
as the primitive null vectors of the integrable g representation of highest weight , for
i 6= 0. the additional (i = 0) primitive null vector has interesting consequences in the
wzw model, as well see.

figure 11. the weight diagram for the a1 representation l(31), correspond-

the presence of the extra null vector is also consistent with the enlargement of the

weyl symmetry w  w . consider the ane formal character

h(cid:1)
ch := trl()(cid:0)e

(3.43)

where, h = pr

i=0 ihi, mult (; ) denotes the multiplicity of the weight  in l(), and

p () := {   ge

: mult (; ) 6= 0 } .

(3.44)

then it is the weyl-kac formula that makes manifest the ane weyl symmetry of ane

characters:

ch = p w w (det w) e w.

(3.45)

where w. indicates the shifted action of w: w. := w( + )  , with  =pr

so that (3.45) can also be written as

ch = p w w (det w) e w(+)

.

(3.47)

one integrable ane highest weight is special:  = k 0 has horizontal projection  = 0.
this indicates that it corresponds to a state that is g-invariant; this state is the vacuum
|0i. the corresponding eld k 0 = 0 is known as the identity primary eld, because of
its action on the vacuum:

k 0 (0) |0i = 0(0) |0i = |vk 0i = |v0i = |0i

(3.48)

(see (2.81)). now, more on the integrable highest-weight representations of g (they are
sometimes called the standard representations, for short).

in terms of chevalley generators, the highest state |vi is dened by ei|vi = 0, for all
i  {0, 1, . . . , r}. but the highest state is annihilated by the raising operator corresponding
to any positive root. so, using the cartan-weyl presentation, we have

e
0 |vi = 0 ,    + ;

j 
n |vi = 0 ,     , n  z>0 ,

(3.49)

where j 
n  {e
positive roots of g:

n , h 

n}. this then points to the appropriate choice of the set + of

+ = +  {n : n  z>0}  { + n :   , n  z>0} .

(3.50)

the full set of roots is  = +  = + ( +). all roots except 0 and the imaginary
ones {n : 0 6= n  z} have unit multiplicity, and each relates to a single element of
g: e+n = e
n. n (including 0) has multiplicity r, relating to the existence of the r
elements h i

n.

so, the generators of g can be written to emphasise their similarity with those for g: one

simply adds mode numbers as subscripts to the symbols for the generators of g. then
their commutation relations also take a form that is simply related to those for g, written

in (3.4),(3.6),(3.8):

[h i

here of course, ,   , and m, n  z.

by the sugawara construction, |vi is also the highest weight of a representation of v ir:
(3.52)

n (j a

mj a

nm) |vi = 0 , n  z>0 .

ln|vi = xmz

33

we also have l0|vi = h|vi, as noted above, with conformal weight h given in (2.76).
such an irreducible representation is not irreducible as a representation of v ir; rather, it

decomposes into an innite number of such representations.

the highest state is nevertheless the highest state of an irreducible representation of v ir.
so, by the state-eld correspondence, the g-primary eld also transforms as a v ir-primary
eld: under the conformal transformation z  w = w(z), an analytic function of z, and

(z)  (w) = (cid:18) dw

dz(cid:19)h

(z) .

(3.53)

so a v ir-primary eld transforms in a tensorial way under conformal transformations.

of particular use to us are the so-called projective transformations, where

w =

az + b
cz + d

, with ad  bc = 1 .

(3.54)

writing a, b, c, d as the elements of a 2  2 matrix shows that these transformations form
a group isomorphic to p sl(2, c): p stands for projective, meaning the matrix and its
negative describe equivalent transformations (3.54); s stands for special, i.e. the matrix

has determinant one; and l means linear. the projective transformations are the only
(invertible) conformal transformations that map the entire complex plane plus the point
at  to itself. they leave the vacuum invariant:

l1 |0i = l0 |0i = 0 ,

(3.55)

since the l1, l0 generate the s(2, c) algebra of the projective group.

for more details, consider innitesimal conformal transformations, i.e. w = z + (z),

with |(z)|  1. (3.53) then yields

(z) = (cid:0)(z)z + h(z)(cid:1)(z) .

(3.56)

if we dont restrict (z) further, we are considering general innitesimal conformal trans-

formations. from their general form (3.54), one can see that innitesimal projective trans-
formations give

(z) = c1 + c0z + c1z2 ,

(3.57)

where c1, c0 are constants. we write

 (z) =

1xm=1

cm [lm, (z)] ,

(3.58)

34

and nd

(3.59)

[lm, (z)] = (cid:0)zm+1z + (m + 1)hzm(cid:1)(z) ,
with m = 1, 0. this last formula is consistent with the commutation relations (2.63) of
v ir, for the modes l1,0, and shows they do generate s(2, c)  v ir.

note that l1 acts as the z-translation operator and l0 as the generator of dilations:

eal1 (z) eal1 = (z + a) ,

eal0 (z) eal0 = (eaz) .

(3.60)

including both the holomorphic and antiholomorphic parts of the primary eld, this last
equation gives

eal0+a l0 ,(z, z) eal0a l0 = ,(eaz, ea z) = eahah ,(z, z) ,

(3.61)

using (3.53), where a denotes the complex conjugate of a. putting a =  + i, with
,   r, we conrm that l0 + l0 is the generator of dilations (radial hamiltonian) and
l0  l0 is the generator of rotations. furthermore, h + h is the scaling dimension of
, and h  h is its spin.

the third generator l1 generates what are known as special conformal transformations.
all three types of transformations (translations, rotations and special conformal transfor-

mations) are conformal in any number n of dimensions. if we restrict the base eld to
r, instead of c, we have an algebra s(2, r). the antiholomorphic counterparts l1, l0
generate another copy of this algebra, and the direct sum of the two copies is isomorphic

to a real form of so(4). in n dimensions, the translations, rotations and special conformal
transformations generate a real form of so(n + 2). in n = 2 the symmetry extends to an

innite-dimensional one, with innite-dimensional algebra (2.54). after central extension,
we nd v ir.

a simple example of a standard representation of g = a1 = a(1)

is depicted in fig.
12. there the weights in ge
0 are drawn (except that the xed eigenvalue k = 2 of k is
not indicated as a coordinate). note that the horizontal weight spaces are those for
the simple lie algebra g = a1; in general, the horizontal subspaces of a representation
l() of g will be (reducible) representations of g.
(this is where the term horizontal
subalgebra g  g comes from.) in particular, for the standard representation l(), the
horizontal representation of lowest l0 eigenvalue is the irreducible representation l() of
g. notice also that the weight diagram is enclosed by a parabolic envelope: a parabola
passes through all weights  such that    is not also in the diagram. its curvature de-
creases with increasing level. the parabola becomes a paraboloid for higher rank algebras.
the simple roots are indicated, as well as the weights of the primitive null vectors. the

multiplicities of the weights rise rapidly with increasing l0 eigenvalue n; asymptotically

mult(cid:0); (, k, n)(cid:1)  n3/4 exp(const.n1/2).

fig. 13 shows the standard representations for arbitrary ane algebras in very schematic
fashion. there is a nite number (the case of card p k
+ = 3 is drawn) of such representa-
tions, each to be associated with a primary eld in the corresponding wzw model. as
mentioned above, the representation l(k 0) is special among them: its lowest horizontal
representation is l(0), the scalar representation, and its lowest l0 eigenvalue is the lowest
of the low. thats because the single state in the representation l(0) is to be identied
with the vacuum of the wzw model. the corresponding primary eld is called the identity

primary eld. the other standard representations have lowest horizontal representations
of higher dimensions, and lowest l0 eigenvalues that are higher than that of the vacuum;
after all, h = l0 + l0, so the vacuum should have lowest energy. these last two eects
go hand-in-hand, as the diagram is meant to indicate.

(2.65) shows that elements of g commute with l0. since h = l0 + l0, this means that
g  g is a true symmetry algebra of the wzw model. the full ane algebra g  g plays
the role of a spectrum-generating algebra in the theory, generating all the states in the

towers corresponding to the primary elds.

the remarkable thing is that the states in these card p k

+ primary towers span the space
of states of the wzw model! g  g generates the full spectrum of the model from the
card p k
+ primary highest states. we can therefore say that the the innite-dimensional

results in detail.

4.1. gepner-witten equation

null vectors constrain the possible couplings between wzw elds. consider a primary
eld realising a standard representation of g, with highest weight . that is, the primary
eld has holomorphic part  (z). this implies f 1+i
 = 0, for all i  {0, 1, . . . , r}. for
i = 0, this can be rewritten as

i

(cid:0)e
1(cid:1)1+0  (z) = 0 .

(4.1)

now, suppose this null eld appears in a correlation function with the primary elds
1(z1), . . . , n(zn); the correlator must then vanish:

h(cid:2)(cid:0)e

1(cid:1)1+0  (z)(cid:3)1(z1)    n(zn) i = 0 .

38

the rst consequence of (4.6) is that a non-integrable eld has vanishing correlators
with integrable elds, i.e. a non-integrable eld decouples from integrable ones. to see
this, let  be the identity eld in (4.6), that is, set  = k 0. then

 (z)|0i = ezl1 k 0 (0)ezl1|0i = |0i ,

(4.7)

using (3.60),(3.55),(3.48). so we can remove  (z) from (4.6). multiply by (z  zn)p1
and integrate over z to get

0 = h 1(z1)    n1(zn1)(t
n)pn(zn) i
0(cid:1)p
= h 1(z1)    n1(zn1)(cid:2)(cid:0)e

n(zn)(cid:3)i ,

(4.8)

for all p  1 + 0. now suppose n is non-integrable, so that there is no p  z>0 such
that [(cid:0)e
0(cid:1)p
n] = 0. then (4.8) will only be satised if h1(z1)    n(zn)i = 0, i.e. if the

non-integrable eld n decouples from the integrable ones 1, . . . , n1.

4.2. 3-point functions

the second application of (4.6) will be to the 3-point correlation functions hi
of primary elds. the 3-point functions encode the structure constants of the operator
product algebra, the ope coecients (see below). so the 3-point functions are arguably

the most important, since in principle, any n-point correlation function can be constructed
using the operator product algebra.

the 3-point functions are highly constrained by global (z-independent) gg invariance,
and invariance under the projective transformations with s(2, c) algebra generated by
l1, l0. well rst examine these constraints, before applying the gepner-witten equation
to arrive at a quite powerful result.

lets work with the holomorphic parts of primary elds, for simplicity. projective in-

variance yields

0 =

+ (m + 1)hjzm

j (cid:21) h 1(z1)    n(zn) i ,

for m  {1, 0, 1}

(compare to (3.59)). the general solution to (4.9) is

h 1(z1)    n(zn) i = f(cid:0) {zpqrs}(cid:1)

nyi,j=1

i<j

(zi  zj)hij ,

(4.10)

where hij = hji, pi6=j hij = 2hj , and f is an arbitrary function of the anharmonic ratios

.

(4.11)

zpqrs :=

(zp  zq)(zr  zs)
(zq  zr)(zs  zp)

39

these ratios are invariant under the projective transformations zi  (azi + b)/(czi + d),
ad  bc = 1.

only n  3 of these anharmonic ratios are independent, so for the 3-point function, f
is simply a constant. before writing the explicit form, let us change notation somewhat.
replace 1, 2, 3 with , , , and well drop the hats on the ane weights. we can
then write

h (x)(y)(z) i = (x  y)h hh (x  z)hh h (y  z)hhh c,, . (4.12)
so the computation of the 3-point function boils down to a computation of a constant
c,, . this constant is related to the ope of primary elds

(z)(0) 

c,,  t
zh+hh

,

(4.13)

and so is called an operator product coecient. here t indicates the highest weight of the
representation contragredient (charge-conjugate) to l(). (the corresponding eld is the
unique one with a non-vanishing 2-point function with the primary eld  .)

the global g invariance of a correlation function of n primary elds imposes

0 =

nxj=1

ta
j h 1(z1)    n(zn) i .

(4.14)

that is, the n-point function must be a g-singlet. for this to be possible, the tensor
product l()  l()  l() must contain the singlet representation l(0). alternatively,
in the tensor-product decomposition

l()  l() = xp+

t 
,l() ,

we require that the tensor-product coecients obey

t  t
, = t,, 6= 0 .

(4.15)

(4.16)

this implies that the corresponding clebsch-gordan coecient c,, 6= 0. in summary,
then, the global g-invariance gives

c,, 6= 0  c,, 6= 0 .

(4.17)

we will henceforth concentrate on 3-point functions.

1!2!(z  z1)1 (z  z2)2 h  (z)(z1)(z2) i .

since the z, z1, z2 dependence of h(z)(z1)(z2)i is xed, the terms in the summation
are independent, and so

(t

t is the raising operator for the a1  g subalgebra in the direction of the highest root  of
g. the maximum number of times it can be applied to a state (vector) v with non-vanishing
result, is called the depth d(, v) of that state, or sometimes the -depth.

to understand the name, look at the example pictured in fig. 8. there is drawn
the weight diagram of the a2-representation l(2, 1). consider as the upward direction
that of the highest root  (see figure 7). since e adds the root  to the weight of a
state, the depth of a state tells us how far down it is from its top, roughly speaking.
concentrating on the 2-dimensional subspace of weight (0, 1), we see that it breaks up
into two one-dimensional subspaces of depths d(, v1) = 1 and d(, v2) = 2. an important
point, however, is that d(, c1v1 + c2v2) = 2, as long as c2 6= 0.

now, if we write

h  (z)(z1)(z2)i =

xul() xvl() xwl()

,u,v,w h u(z)v(z1)w(z2) i ,

(4.20)

following (2.84), we can conclude from (4.19) that even if hu|w vi is non-zero, the 3-point
function hu(z)v(z1)w(z2)i will vanish unless

d(, v) + d(, w) < k + 1  (, ) = 1 + 0.

(4.21)

but if hu(z)v(z1)w(z2)i vanishes, then so does h (z)(z1)(z2)i. therefore, a necessary
condition for h (z)(z1)(z2)i 6= 0 is: whenever hu|v  wi 6= 0, (4.21) must be obeyed.
this is the gepner-witten depth rule.

41

4.4. tensor products and rened depth rule

are |ji = f 1+j

can we get additional constraints from other null vectors? no: the primitive null vectors
|vi for i  {0, 1, . . . , r}. we have just used the rst (j = 0), and all others
are present at the lowest grade in l(), and so are isomorphic to the primitive null vectors
of the g-representation l(). these latter determine the clebsch-gordan coecients for

j

g. so, the depth rule should allow the determination of the operator product coecients
c,, from a knowledge of the clebsch-gordan coecients c,, . this turns out to be
less straightforward than one might hope, however.

to see why, we consider the simpler problem of computing the operator product mul-
tiplicities (called fusion coecients) from the corresponding tensor-product multiplicities

(well call them tensor-product coecients). being multiplicities, these coecients are
non-negative integers. a general tensor-product decomposition is written in (4.15); there
the t 

,  z0. the simplest example of such a decomposition is for g = a1:
l(1)  l(1) = l(1 + 1)  l(1 + 1  2)      l(|1  1|) ,

(4.22)

where we write l(1) for l(11), e.g. if we change notation using 1 = 2j1, 1 = 2j2,
and 1 = 2j, we recognise the rule for the addition of quantum angular momenta.

reasoning similar to that given above leads to the following rule.

if w, v, u 
, = 0) unless when hu|w  vi 6= 0,

(4.23)

l(), l(), l(), respectively, then c
we have

, = 0 (and so t 

(cid:0)ei(cid:1)1 |wi  (cid:0)ei(cid:1)2 |ui = 0 ,

for all 1 + 2  1 + i, for i  {1, . . . , r}. if we generalise the denition of depth to:

d(, v) = min{   z0 : (e)+1v = 0 } ,

then we require

d(i, v) + d(i, w) < 1 + i ,  i  {1, . . . , r} .

(4.24)

(4.25)

compare this to (4.21).

before writing a more useful version of this rule, lets look again at the example already
mentioned above (4.20). suppose we have a space v spanned by two independent states
v1, v2, of depths d(, v1) = 1, d(, v2) = 2, respectively. choosing a dierent basis, (v1 
v2)/2, say, gives depths 2,2. the set of depths is a basis-dependent object. so, we should
instead be concerned with the dimensions of the spaces vi := {v  v : (e)1+iv = 0},
for i = 1, 2, which are 1 and 2 in this example, respectively. of course, a particular choice

42

of basis may help; {v1, v2} is a basis of v that is good for the computation of the required
dimensions, while the other basis is not.

now, the highest-weight state |vi must appear in l()  l() (as well as all others).

so, we must be able to write

cv
w,u |wi  |ui ,

|vi = xwl() xul()
for some coecients cv
w,u. it is not dicult to show that |vi must contain a non-zero
component  |wi|ui, where |wi is the highest state of l(), and u  l(). otherwise,
cv
w,u = 0 would imply that cv
w,u = 0 for all w  l(). of course, so that the component
|wi  |ui has the correct weight , we must have

(4.26)

h |ui = (

rxj=1

jhi) |ui = (  ) |ui .

therefore, we can write (see [31], for example)

t 

, = dim(cid:8) u  l(;   ) : (ei)1+iu = 0  i = 1, . . . , r(cid:9)

= : dim v 

, ,

where we have used

l(;   ) := (cid:8) u  l() : hu = (  )u(cid:9) .

(4.27)

(4.28)

(4.29)

for the operator product numbers, or fusion coecients (k)n

tensor product, or fusion product:


,, we write a truncated

l() k l() = p k

+

(k)n


, l() .

(4.30)

of course, since p k
in p k

+. but truncation here means that

+  p+ (see (3.42)), (k)n



, are undened if any of , ,   p+ are not

an argument similar to that above leads to the following conjecture [32] (see also [33]):

(k)n



,  t 

, .

(4.31)

(k)n



, = dim(cid:8) u  l(;   ) : (ei)1+iu = 0  i = 0, . . . , r(cid:9)

= : dim (k)v


, .

(4.32)

43

here, a special case of the extra conditions (4.21) has been incorporated into a formula
similar to (4.28). (recall that since 0 = (, 0, 1), 0 = .)

well call (4.32) the rened depth rule. notice it explains (4.31). in fact, (4.32) implies

the following stronger relations

(k)n



,  (k+1)n 

, ,

(k)n


, = t 

, .

lim
k

(4.33)

all this can be encoded in the concept of a threshold level [34]. when t 

, > 1, we say
that there are more than one dierent couplings l()  l()  l(). that is, there is
more than one way to assemble the states of l() in the tensor product l()  l(). if
in addition, l()  l() k l(), we say that the coupling is also a fusion coupling at
level k.

for each of the t 

, couplings l()  l() l(), there exists a threshold level kt, such

that the coupling is not a fusion coupling at levels k < kt, and is for all levels k  kt.

the threshold level allows a convenient notation: the fusion products for all levels can

be written as the tensor product with threshold levels as subscripts:

then

l()  l() = kt 

(kt)n

, l()kt .

(k)n


, =

kxkt

(kt)n

, .

(4.34)

(4.35)

in (4.35) the sum is over all couplings, and any coupling with kt  k contributes once.
the a1 example (4.22) becomes

l(1)  l(1) = l(1 + 1)1+1  l(1 + 1  2)1+11
     l(|1  1|)max(1,1) .

(4.36)

this can be derived from the depth rule, by considering the coupling l(1)  l(1)l(1)
and corresponding u  l(1), with hu = [(1  1)1]u. the depth is easily seen to be
d(, u) = (1  1 + 1)/2, so that

kt = (1  1 + 1)/2 + (, ) = (1 + 1 + 1)/2 .

(4.37)

let us rewrite the a1 fusion product one more way:

l(1)  l(1) = min(1+1,2k11)

1=|11|

l(1) .

(4.38)

44

this the original form found by gepner and witten, and it makes clear the level-truncation
of the tensor product.

an a2 example is

l(1, 1)2 = l(0, 0)2  l(1, 1)2

l(3, 0)3  l(1, 1)3  l(0, 3)3 
l(2, 2)4 .

(4.39)

this is perhaps the simplest example with a t 
(1,1),(1,1) = 1,
(k>2)n (1,1)
(1,1),(1,1) = 2. this phenomenon occurs because algebras of rank greater than one
(i.e. g 6= a1) have most mult (; ) := dim l(; ) > 1, the spaces of xed weight  in a
representation l() are typically not one-dimensional.6

, > 1: we have (2)n (1,1)

4.5. good bases and the littlewood-richardson rule

now lets try to use the rened depth rule (4.32) to compute fusion products like (4.39).
since the level k will gure more prominently henceforth, well let gk indicate the ane
algebra g at xed level k.


, = dim (k)v 

,  v 

the problem is to nd a good choice of basis of l(;   ) to simplify (as much as
possible) the computation of (k)n
,  l(;   ). lets rst back
, = dim v 
up and consider t 
,. after all, the problem of a good choice of basis already
exists in the computation of t 
, (for the i-depths, if not for the -depth). suppose a
basis b(;   ) = {ua : a = 1, . . . , dim l(;   )} of l(;   ) were to be good; what
should that mean? ideally, one could test the ua one-by-one, and those passing would form
a basis of v 
, would be spanned by the subset of b(;   )
,. it turns out that such good bases (or proper bases) b(p)(;  )
that are elements of v 
exist [36]:

,. that is, the subspace v 

v 
, = span{ ua  b(p)(;   ) : ua  v 

, } ,

(4.40)

for all possible highest weights , ,   p+.

for the case g = ar, the basis elements are indexed by standard tableaux, for example

1 2 2 4
3 3 5
4
5

.

(4.41)

6 except for a g2 exception, it turns out that mult (; ) = 1 i    has a unique expression as a
z0-linear combination of those positive roots  of g also obeying (, ) > 0 [35].

45

the tableaux with numbers removed are called young tableaux, and their boxes are ar-
ranged in left-justied rows, of non-increasing length going from top to bottom. to obtain
a standard tableau relevant to the ar case, the numbers added must be from the set
{1, 2, . . . , r + 1}, and they must appear in non-decreasing order from left to right in the
rows, and in increasing order from top to bottom in the columns. notice this implies that
a single column of a standard tableau can contain no more than r + 1 boxes, for the ar
case.

in combination with (4.28), the good bases (with elements indexed by standard tableaux)
lead to a simple rule for the computation of tensor-product coecients, the littlewood-
richardson rule, to be explained below. each box i
stands for a weight in the basic
representation l(1) of ar, so the weight wt( i ) of

is

i

wt( i ) = 1  1  2  . . .  i1 = 


1

,

i1 + i ;

r

,

i = 1

i = 2, . . . , r
i = r + 1

(4.42)

notice that pr+1
i=1 wt( i ) = 0; therefore a column of length r + 1 can be dropped from
a standard tableau. the weight wt(t#) of a standard tableau t# is just the sum of the
weights of its component boxes. the shape sh(t#) of a standard tableau t# is the weight
of the tableau obtained by replacing all the numbers in the i-th row with is. notice
that the shape of a standard tableau will always be a dominant weight (i.e. an element
of p+); it will be the highest weight of the relevant representation. to restrict to those
highest weights relevant to the ar wzw model, the number of columns of length less
than or equal to r must be less than or equal to k (see (3.42)). the weight of the young
tableau t obtained from the standard tableau t# by removing its numbers, is dened by
wt(t ) := sh(t#).

the elements of the good basis b(p)(; ) are indexed by the elements of

t#(; ) = { t#  s# : sh(t#) = , wt(t#) =  } ,

(4.43)

where s# just means the space of standard tableaux. well write v(t#) for the state
indexed by the standard tableau t#. the elements of these bases appropriate for the a2
representation l(1, 1) are shown in fig. 15. there the tableaux are drawn, roughly at the

positions of their weights in weight space.

the action of the step operators ei and fi (i = 1, 2), can be transcribed to an action on
the standard tableaux. i will describe it later in the more convenient language of paths.
for the moment, their actions (up to non-zero multiplicative factors) are indicated in fig.

figure 15. shown are the standard tableaux that label the states of the a2
representation l(1, 1) in the good basis.

15 by the lines drawn. notice that a single line species the action of both ei and fi (xed
i). thats because of the property

eit# 6= 0  fieit#  t# ,
fit# 6= 0  eifit#  t# ,

(4.44)

which guarantees the good-ness property, as can be seen from the diagram.

also, the depths d(i, t#) := d(i, v(t#)) of a standard tableau are easily found. notice
that the j right-most columns of a standard tableau form a standard tableau; call it t (j)
# ,
it turns out that the weights of these
where j ranges from 0 to the full width of t#.
sub-tableaux determine the depths d(i, t#) for all i = 1, 2, . . . , r. precisely, we have

d(i, t#) = maxj(cid:0) wt(t (j)

i (cid:1) .
# ), 

(4.45)

we can also speak of the height h(i, t#). by d(i, t#) (h(i, t#)) is meant the maxi-
mal non-negative integer  such that e
i t# 6= 0). so, h(i, t#) = d(i, t#), for
example. they are also simply found, since for a state u in any a1 = hei, hi, fii  g rep-
resentation, h(i, u)  d(i, u) = (, 
i ), if hu = (, i)u. now, notice that the tableaux
drawn in fig. 15, can be assigned to a single irreducible representation of hei, hi, fii for
each of i = 1, 2. this property generalises to all ranks r, and so

it# 6= 0 (f 

h(i, t#) = (cid:0) wt(t#), 

i (cid:1) + d(i, t#) .

47

(4.46)

the property just mentioned is another way of describing the good-ness of the required
bases.

consider the g = a2 example b(p)( (1, 1); (0, 0) ).

(4.50)

(4.51)

a glance at fig. 15 conrms these results.

when substituted into (4.28), the depths obtained by (4.45) yield the littlewood-
richardson rule, a simple rule for the computation of the g = ar tensor-product coecients
t 
,:

t 

, = card(cid:8)t#  t#(;   ) : d(i, t#)  i

(i = 1, . . . , r)(cid:9) .

by (4.43), we have

t#(;   ) = (cid:8)t#  s# : sh(t#) = , wt(t#) =   (cid:9) .

(4.52)

(4.53)

we should mention that this is not precisely the form of the rule originally given by

littlewood and richardson. it is, however, related to it by a simple transformation (see
[37], for example).

to use the littlewood-richardson rule, one can rst draw the young tableau t of shape
. consider a standard tableau t# of shape  and weight   . add its sub-tableaux t (j)

#

48

to t by placing boxes  to the right of the -th row (numbered from top to bottom)of
t. an a5 example, with  = (3, 1, 2, 1),  = (1, 1, 2, 0) and  = (2, 0, 3, 2) is

(4.54)

if the shape of the resulting mixed tableau (dened in the obvious way) is dominant (i.e.
,. also, the corresponding vector v(t#) is

# , then t# contributes 1 to t 

in p+) for all t (j)
an element of the basis of v 

,.

to make things clear, consider a simple a2 example: lets verify that t 

(1,0),(1,1) =
1. the tableaux of shape  = (1, 1) and weight    = (0, 0) are those drawn in (4.47).
adding the sub-tableaux t (j)
gives the mixed
tableaux

# (j = 1 and 2) of the rst one to t =

, = t (1,0)

1

2 ,

2
3

,

(4.55)

so that the rst tableau contributes 1 to the tensor-product coecient. with the second,

however, adding t (1)

# = 3 to t gives

.

3

(4.56)

therefore, the second tableau of (4.47) does not contribute, and we nd t (1,0)

(1,0),(1,1) = 1.

one nice feature of the littlewood-richardson rule is that one simply counts the number
of standard tableaux of a certain type that pass a specic test. furthermore, this test can be

applied to the candidate tableaux one-by-one, without referring to the other candidates.
for example, there are no redundancies or cancellations between candidates. for this
reason, well call the littlewood-richardson rule a combinatorial rule.

the littlewood-richardson rule can be stated in many dierent ways. the version
described is well suited to the application of (4.28), however, with its connection between
standard tableaux and the vectors of b(p)(;   ).

more importantly, the standard tableaux can be replaced by universal objects, that can

be dened for any simple g in a uniform way. so the littlewood-richardson rule can be
adapted from the case of g = ar to all simple g. it was littelmann who completed this
generalisation, rst using sequences of weyl group elements as the universal objects, and
then using sequences of weights [38]. in the littlewood-richardson rule, both sequences

49

have to do with the sub-tableaux t (j)
columns of t#, reading from right to left.

# of a standard tableaux t#, or equivalently, the

the more economical generalisation is the one using the sequences of weights.

it is
phrased in terms of littelmann paths in weight space. well look at the g = ar case, but
generalisation is straightforward. to each standard tableau, we can associate a piecewise
linear path in weight space as follows: read the weights of the columns of the standard

tableau from right to left, and associate a piece of the path to each. the vector position of
the end of such a piece minus that of the beginning equals the weight of the corresponding

column. so, by adding the pieces, in order (right to left on the tableau), we obtain the
relevant path.

as an example, fig. 16 shows the littelmann paths for the outer weights of the a2

representation l(2, 1).

figure 16. the littelmann paths are drawn for the outermost weights of the
representation l(2, 1) of a2. for each such weight , the shortest route from
0 to  is the relevant path.

as promised, well indicate the action of the step operators ei, fi (i = 1, . . . , r) on
the paths. by the equivalence of standard tableaux and littelmann paths, this will also

describe the actions on the standard tableaux. it is important to realise, however, that
what we describe is only the action of the step operators up to normalisation. let v()

50

denote the state labelled by the path . ei, fi acting on a path  yield other paths, ei, fi.
then we have ei v()  v(ei) and fi v()  v(fi), with non-zero multiplicative factors
left unspecied.
first consider ei. parametrise a path  with parameter t  [0, 1]. wt(cid:0)(t)(cid:1) is the weight
of a point t of the path. wt(cid:0)(0)(cid:1) = 0, and wt(cid:0)(1)(cid:1) is the weight of the path wt(),
the highest vector. first nd the minimum non-positive integer value of (cid:0)wt((t)), 
i(cid:1)
for t  [0, 1]; call it mi. let t2 be the minimum value of t where (cid:0)wt((t)), 
i(cid:1) = mi.
if mi  1, then nd the maximum value of t < t2 such
that (cid:0)wt((t)), 
i(cid:1) = mi + 1, and call that t1. now break the path up into three pieces,

and the weight of the corresponding vector and standard tableau. similarly, the shape
of the path sh() equals the shape of the corresponding young tableau, or the weight of

if mi = 0, then ei = 0.

corresponding to the intervals:

0  t  t1 ,

t1  t  t2 ,

t2  t  1 .

(4.57)

weyl reect the middle piece across the hyperplane normal to i at wt((t1)). finally,
re-attach the third piece (corresponding to t2  t  1) at (t2) + i, to obtain the path
ei.

it is not hard to see that this action yields d(i, v() ) = mi for the vector v() that
is indexed by the path . a diagram sketching the action of ei on a path  is given in fig.
17.

as above, consider m 

the action of the lowering operator fi is dened similarly; see fig. 18. with mi dened
i  1, rst nd the
i(cid:1) = mi; call it t1. then obtain the minimum
i(cid:1) = mi+1; call that t2. then the three intervals (4.57)

i = wt()  mi. if m 
maximum value of t such that (cid:0)wt((t)), 
value of t > t1 such that(cid:0)wt((t), 
are again relevant, and fi is found by reecting the middle piece across the hyperplane
normal to i at wt((t1)), and re-attaching the third piece at (t2)  i.

i = 0, then fi = 0. if m 

it is not hard to see that m 

i so dened is the height h(i, v() ) for the vector v() that

is indexed by the path .

with the actions so-dened, weve drawn in fig. 19 the analogue of fig. 15 for the
a2 representation l(2, 1). again, the lines indicate the action of the step operators
e1, e2, f1, f2.

incidentally, the graphs of figs. 15,19 are (essentially) examples of so-called crystal
graphs [39][40]. these arise in the theory of quantum groups uq(g), the q-deformations of
the universal enveloping algebra u (g) = u1(g) of g. such quantum groups allow the con-
struction of integrable lattice models in two-dimensions, in the spirit of the 2-dimensional
ising model. the graphs reect the simplied representation theory of uq(g) at q = 0.

(one can also say that the existence of the canonical bases at q = 1 is explained by the
simplied representation theory at q = 0 [41].) but physically, q = 0 corresponds to
absolute zero temperature, justifying the reference to crystals.

to make the actions of the ladder operators on paths completely clear, well do a couple

of examples. first consider the path of weight (2,-2) drawn in fig. 16. we indicate this
path by the weights of its straight segments, written in sequence:

 = { (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) } .

(roughly) at the positions of their weights. the lines indicate the action of
the step operators e1, e2, f1, f2 on the good basis elements indexed by the
tableaux (or by the corresponding littelmann paths).

2(cid:1); here it
to nd e2, we rst need m2, the minimum non-positive value of (cid:0)wt((t)), 
is -2. we nd wt((t1)) = (1, 1) and wt((t2)) = (2, 2). (notice here that the third
piece of (4.57) corresponds to the single value t = 1.) the middle piece consists of a
single, straight segment, of weight (1, 1), and so is reected to a similar single, straight

53

a
p
segment of weight r2(1, 1) = (0, 1). so we nd

e2  = { (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, 1)} ,

a path that is not drawn in fig. 16.

now consider f1, with  the path

 = { (1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 1)} ,

(4.59)

(4.60)

1 = 0  (1) = 1. wt((t1)) = (1, 1) and
of weight (0, 2). we have m1 = 1, and so m 
wt((t2)) = (0, 1) indicate that the middle piece is a single, straight segment of weight
(1, 0), that must be replaced by one of weight r1(1, 0) = (1, 1). as a result, we nd

e1  = { (1, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1) } ,

(4.61)

a path that is drawn in fig. 16.

what is the form of the littlewood-richardson rule in terms of paths? to calculate
t 
, , one considers all paths  of shape sh() =  and weight wt() =   . such a path
, i  + wt(cid:0)(t)(cid:1) has non-negative dynkin indices for all t  [0, 1].
will contribute 1 to t 
that is, we require (cid:0) + wt((t)), 
i )  0, for all i  {1, . . . , r}, and all 0  t  1. in
other words, the -translated path  + wt(cid:0)(t)(cid:1) must remain in the dominant sector; it

must be a dominant path.

this form of the littlewood-richardson rule is very general, applicable to all sym-
metrisable kac-moody algebras. these paths also have some interesting invariances. for
example, one can generate a valid set of paths for the vectors of l() by acting successively

with lowering operators on the highest path, in all inequivalent ways. furthermore, one
can use any dominant path as the highest path [42], even the straight line from 0 to !

this is all interesting, but what we really want to know is how to adapt this machinery

to the formula (4.32) for the computation of fusion coecients (k)n
,. can we nd an
analogue of the littlewood-richardson rule for fusions: a combinatorial rule that computes
the fusion coecients (k)n


,?

for that we also need to consider the action of e. restricting to g = ar, we have

 = 1 + 2 + . . . + r. by the cartan-weyl commutation relations (3.8),

e  ad (e1)ad (e2)    ad (er) er .

(4.62)

for example, if r = 2, e  [e1, e2]. figures 15, 19 reveal that the basis b(p)(; ) that is
good for the calculation of tensor-product coecients, is not also good for the calculation
of their truncated versions, the fusion coecients [32][43].

54

for example, consider again b(p)( (1, 1); (0, 0) ), and the relevant tableaux (4.47). we

on the other hand, we know (by means to be discussed soon) that (2)n (1,1)
(3)n (1,1)

(1,1),(1,1) = 1, and
(1,1),(1,1) = 2. this means that some linear combination v0 of the vectors labelled

is there another basis that is good for (k)n


,? no. such a basis must be good for the
,, and in the case of g = a2, such a basis is unique. so no

tensor-product coecients t 
such basis exists for a2; neither does one for any ar  a2.

so, to nd the fusion coecients by this route, the appropriate linear combinations must
be found. they would be useful for the computation of the ope coecients c
,. but
for the fusion coecients only, this is a bit much. luckily, there is another way to nd the

fusion coecients, due to verlinde.

4.6. ane characters and modular transformations

in order to motivate verlindes approach, let us rst discuss some results on ane
algebras that will turn out to be important for ane fusion [44]. consider the ane

character (3.43) made informal:

well set

ch() := xp ()

mult (; ) e(,)

.

 = 2i(cid:0) :=

rxj=1

zj 

j , , 0(cid:1) ,

and use (3.47) to bring in the ane weyl group w . then one nds

ch() = e2i(cid:0)h c(g,k)

24 (cid:1) pww (det w) (k+h)
pww (det w) (h)
where {z} stands for (z1, z2, . . . , zr), and the theta functions are
ei(cid:2)2(+k,) 

k2 |+k|2(cid:3) .

(k)

 (, {z}) := xq

w(+)(, {z})
w (, {z})

(4.64)

(4.65)

,

(4.66)

(4.67)

55

recall also that h and c(g, k) are the conformal weight of , and the virasoro central
charge, respectively (see (2.76),(2.62)). it is convenient to dene the normalised character

(, {z}) := e2i(cid:0)h c(g,k)

24 (cid:1) ch() .

then we have the simple relation

(, {z}) = pww (det w) (k+h)
pww (det w) (h)

w(+)(, {z})
w (, {z})

.

(4.68)

(4.69)

this last result is remarkable. first, notice that the sums are both over the nite weyl

group of the simple lie algebra g. consequently, there is a striking resemblance to the
weyl character formula (3.22) for g.

one can trace the appearance of the w -sums to the semi-direct product structure of
w , (3.40). when acting on a shifted weight, such as  + ,   p k
+, we have w =
w  t(k+h)q . the other factor t(k+h)q is responsible for the presence of the theta
functions. these latter are well-known to have remarkable transformation properties under

the group p sl(2, z), the so-called modular group . the modular group is generated by
the elements s :   1/ and t :    + 1, and the general modular transformation
has the form

 

a + b
c + d

,

a, b, c, d  z ,

ad  bc = 1 .

(4.70)

so, this transformation can be encoded in a 2  2 integer matrix, of determinant one, or
the negative of such a matrix; thus  = p sl(2, z).

as a consequence of the appearance of the theta functions in (4.69), we nd that the nor-
malised characters transform among themselves under modular transformations. speci-

cally, kac and peterson showed that

(1/, {z/}) = xp k
( + 1, {z}) = xp k

+ (see (3.42)) matrices s(k) and t (k),
consider the card p k
+ = card p k
with elements s(k)
,, respectively; they turn out to be unitary, showing that
the normalised characters form a unitary representation of (a subgroup of) the modular

+  card p k
, and t (k)

, = , e2i(cid:0)h c(g,k)

(4.72)

where f (g, k) is a constant independent of , .

4.7. kac-peterson relation and verlinde formula

the form of the s(k)

, recalls the numerator of the weyl character formula (3.22). to

recover the full character, rather than just the numerator, we can take a ratio to nd

s(k)
s(k)

,

0,

= ch(cid:0)  2i

 + 

k + h (cid:1) .

(4.73)

well call this important result the kac-peterson relation.

why should there be such an intimate relation between the modular matrix s(k) of the
ane characters and the characters of g? an answer is provided by conformal eld theory,

and more specically here, by the wzw model.

first, recall one of the uses of characters in the representation theory of g. consider the
t 
,l(), and the formal element eh

tensor-product decomposition l() l() =pp+

in it. taking traces gives

(4.74)

(4.75)

chch = xp+

t 
,ch .

one says that the simple lie characters obey the tensor-product algebra.

it is therefore natural to wonder if the kac-peterson ratios

(k)
 () :=

s(k)

have interesting multiplicative properties. after all, (4.73) says that they are discretised
simple lie characters. one nds

(4.77)

using the unitarity of s(k). this is the celebrated verlinde formula [45]. it is valid for all
rcfts, when the corresponding modular s matrices are used.

4.8. duality

the verlinde formula, in the form (4.76), provides a rationale for the kac-peterson
relation (4.73). as the depth rule makes clear, the wzw fusion products should be
truncated versions of the g tensor products, because the horizontal subalgebra g  g is
a true symmetry of the theory. it is perhaps not too surprising then that the quantities
{(k)
+} that obey the fusion rule algebra (4.76) turn out to be discretised
characters of g. roughly, that they are characters means that the fusion coecients are
intimately related to the corresponding tensor-product coecients. their discretisation
is a consequence of constraints coming from the spectrum-generating algebra g  g. it will
imply that the fusion coecients are bounded above by the tensor-product coecients.

 () :   p k

but that does not explain the verlinde formula in any way: why should ratios of modular
s matrix elements have anything to do with fusions, let alone represent the fusion algebra?

the answer arises from the powerful concept of duality in conformal eld theory [46].
consider an arbitrary correlation function in a conformal eld theory, not necessarily a
wzw model. one nds that such a correlation function factorises into holomorphic and

antiholomorphic parts:

c( z1, . . . , zn, 1, . . . , m ; z1, . . . , zn, 1, . . . , m ) =

xi, j

ci, j bi ( z1, . . . , zn, 1, . . . , m ) b j ( z1, . . . , zn, 1, . . . , m ) .

(4.78)

here z1, . . . , zn are meant to indicate the positions of the n elds (points) of the correla-
tion function, and the j are constants (sometimes moduli) set by the type of correlation
function under consideration. for the general class of conformal eld theories known as

rational conformal eld theories (rcfts), which includes the wzw models, the sums
over i, j are (discrete and) nite. the functions bi , b j are known as conformal blocks.
the factorisation (4.78) is not unique, however. as was alluded to earlier, the conformal
blocks can (in principle) be calculated using the operator product algebra. if we symbolise

58

figure 20. the graph labelling a conformal block for the 3-point function.

a non-zero operator product coecient c
, by the graph of figure 20, we are associating
that graph to the conformal block of a 3-point function. in a similar way, we can label a

choice of conformal blocks by a trivalent graph. part of the non-uniquenes of the conformal
blocks comes from the non-uniqueness of the trivalent graph as label.

for example, consider a 4-point function. its conformal blocks can be labelled by either
of the two trivalent graphs of fig. 21. the underlying assumption of duality is that the

nal physical correlation function must not depend on the choice of graph. furthermore,
duality states that there must be a linear relation between the conformal blocks associated

with the two graphs, such that this is true. the matrix encoding the particular linear
relation shown in the figure, is called the fusing matrix f .

there is a another, related way of thinking of these trivalent graphs. when radial
quantisation was mentioned earlier, the conformal transformation (2.31) from the cylinder

to the complex plane was discussed. one can think of the resulting plane as having two
special, marked points, at the origin and at . the inverse conformal transformation
maps the plane with these two marked points (or punctures) to a riemann surface, the
cylinder. letting the radius shrink to zero gives a particularly simple trivalent graph, a
straight line.

if one considers a 4-point function, however, one has four marked points, and a conformal
transformation can be found to map the plane to a riemann surface. the riemann surface

will be topologically equivalent to a riemann sphere with four marked points. one can
then recover a trivalent graph by shrinking the sphere in dierent ways. in particular, one

can recover the two dierent graphs of fig. 21.

with this latter picture, duality can tell us why the modular group  enters considera-
tion. the modular group is intimately connected with riemann surfaces (with no marked

points) of genus one, i.e. with tori. represent a torus by a parallelogram with opposite
sides identied, as in fig. 22. we will consider a conformal eld theory on such a torus.

by conformal invariance, the overall scale doesnt matter, so we set the sides of the par-
alellogram as shown in the figure. the conformal class of the torus can thus be specied

by one complex number, its modulus  . but this is still a redundant description. it is
simple to see that t :    + 1 does not change the underlying torus. furthermore, after
a rescaling, s :   1/ doesnt either. so the conformal class of the torus is invariant
under the full modular group  = hs, ti.
now consider the correlation function

(4.79)

z( ) = e2i( c

24   c

= trh e2i(cid:0) (l0 c

24  ) trh e2i(cid:0) h(iim  )+p(re  )(cid:1)

24 ) +( l0 c

24 )(cid:1) ,

where  is the complex conjugate of  , c and c are the holomorphic and antiholomorphic
central charges, and h is the hilbert space of the theory. we have used that the hamil-

60

t
tonian and rotation operators are h = l0 + l0 and p = l0  l0, respectively (see after
(3.61)). (4.79) is known as the torus partition function.

let us restrict once more to consideration of wzw models; what well say, how-
ever, can also be adapted straightforwardly to all rcfts. now, by the holomorphic-

antiholomorphic factorisation of wzw models, the hilbert space has the form

h = ,p k

+

m, h  h ,

(4.80)

+) is the hilbert space of states in the conformal tower

with m,  z0. here h (  p k

z(, ) = x,p k

+

m, (, {0}) 

( , {0}) .

(4.81)

that is, the conformal blocks for the torus partition function are the normalised characters.
the corresponding trivalent graph is a loop, but the blocks are also labelled by the torus
modulus  . but  ,  + 1, 1/ , etc., are all dierent ways of labelling the same torus. so
duality implies the modular covariance (4.71) of the normalised characters.

summarising to this point:

in a rcft, (normalised) characters appear naturally as
conformal blocks for the torus partition function, and duality implies that they must be

modular covariant.

conformal block for it.

but this is just one simple consequence of duality; much more can be extracted, including
the verlinde formula. to derive it from duality, one needs to consider a correlation function

that can involve both the 3-point functions (and so the fusion coecients) and the torus
(so that the modular transformations are involved). it is the 3-point functions on the torus

61

that are pertinent in this context. fig. 23 shows a torus with three marked points, and a
choice of a trivalent graph to label the corresponding conformal block. that choice makes

it clear how the 3-point functions and the characters appear. but there are many other
choices of graphs, and one can also replace  with 1/ , for example. these freedoms are
not completely independent, however. they turn out to be sucient to prove the verlinde

formula, but we will not provide the detailed argument here [46].

recapping, we have seen that the remarkable modular properties of ane characters are
accounted for in the physical context of wzw models. the underlying concept is duality,

a property that extends to all rcfts. it also implies many other important relations.
the verlinde formula is just one symptom of duality in conformal eld theory.

4.9. fusion coecients as weyl sums

to close this section, let us return to the problem of computing wzw fusion coecients,
and apply the verlinde formula (4.77). the kac-peterson relation (4.73) in (4.74) implies

(k)
 () (k)

 () = xp+

t 
, (k)

 () ,

(4.82)

where we have used the notation (4.75). compare this with (4.76). both are valid   p k
+.
(4.76) led to (4.77) by the unitarity of the matrix s(k). a relation between the tensor-

product coecients t 
, should result from the same
unitarity, except that the ranges are not identical. the sum over p+ in (4.82) must be
restricted to a sum over p k

, and the fusion coecients (k)n

+, as in (4.76).

to do so, we make use of the alternating weyl symmetry (3.23), as applied to the

kac-peterson ratios:

(k)
w.() = (det w) (k)

 () ,  w  w .

(4.83)

this is not sucient, however. to restrict the sum over   p+ to a sum over   p k
+,
we need to use elements of the ane weyl group w , not just w  w (see fig. 10, for
example). more accurately, we need the action of the ane weyl group projected onto the
weight space of the horizontal subalgebra g  g.

consider the ane primitive reection r0, with action on ane weights given in (3.38).
just as  is used to denote the horizontal part of the ane weight , r0. will indicate the
horizontal part of r0.. one nds

r0. = r. + (k + h) ,

(4.84)

62

where r  w is the weyl reection across the hyperplane normal to the highest root .
then

e 2i

k+h (r0.,+) = e 2i

k+h (r .,+) ,

(4.85)

for   p+, since then (,  + )  z. using this and the weyl character formula (3.22),
we nd

r0.() = (det r) (k)
(k)

 () = (det r0) (k)

 () .

(4.86)

since the ane weyl group w can be obtained from the weyl group w of g by adjoining
r0 as a generator, we have

(k)
w.() = (det w) (k)

 () ,  w  w .

(4.87)

using this in (4.82), and comparing with (4.76), we get

xp k

+

xw w

(det w) t 

, (k)

 () = xp k

+

(k)n


, (k)

 () ,

(4.88)

+. the unitarity of s(k) means that the coecients of (k)

for all   p k
side of (4.88) can be equated with those on the right hand side, for all   p k
we nd [26][47][48]

 () on the left hand
+. therefore

(k)n



, = xw w

(det w) t w.

, .

(4.89)

the dependence of the right-hand side on the level k is implicit: for a xed   p+, w.
can change with changing level, when w  w (see (4.84)).

this last equation provides a fairly simple way of computing the fusion coecients. for

example, one can employ the littlewood-richardson rule (or littelmanns generalisation)
to rst nd the tensor-product coecients t 
,, and then perform the alternating weyl
sum of (4.89). however, since it is an alternating sum (the signs are inherited from the
weyl character formula) cancellations occur, and the rule is not a combinatorial one.

another expression can be given for the fusion coecients as an alternating ane weyl
sum. this one will allow a connection with the rened depth rule (4.32). using (3.19)
brings in the weight multiplicities, and in (4.74) it leads to

t 

, = xww

(det w) mult (; w.  ) .

(4.90)

63

in (4.89), this results in

(k)n



, = xw w

(det w) mult (; w.  ) .

(4.91)

this formula encodes a straightforward algorithm for the computation of the fusion

coecients. first, the weight  +  is added to all the weights of p (). the resulting
weights are regarded as horizontal projections of ane weights, at level k + h. one then
attempts to weyl transform the resulting weights into the dominant (w = id) sector, using
the horizontal projection of the ane weyl group. some of the weights will be xed by an
ane weyl reection; that is, they can only lie on the boundary of the dominant sector

after weyl transformation. these should be ignored. the others will be transformed into
the dominant sector, some by elements of w of determinant +1, and some by elements
of determinant -1. the latter will always cancel some other dominant weights of the rst

kind. the nal result will be a set of dominant weights { + } with multiplicities (k)n
,,
the quantities to be calculated.

the algorithm can be pictured in a weight diagram, for ranks  2. a simple example is
drawn in fig. 24. recall now the rened depth rule (4.32). the conditions (ei)1+iu =

0 can be interpreted as saying that the states u that count toward (k)n
, are those for
which the cancelling states (ei)1+iu do not exist. if one does, then the alternating
weyl sum formula (4.91) tells us that the cancelling states weight will be reected into
the dominant sector, to cancel the weight , in the algorithm of the previous paragraph.

this concludes our discussion of the computation of fusion coecients, as an example

of an application of the representation theory of ane algebras to wzw models.

5. conclusion

we hope these lecture notes have given some indication of the beauty of the subject of

conformal eld theory, and the associated innite-dimensional algebras.

well close with a brief (and incomplete) guide to the review literature on conformal eld
theories, ane algebras, and their relation. the most comprehensive reference to date is

[49]. another monograph is [50].

for the beginner in conformal eld theory, the reviews [51] [52] [53] and [54] (in french)
are quite user-friendly. so is cardys review [12], which emphasises the statistical me-

chanics applications of conformal eld theory. for more applications, see [13].

for a review of rational conformal eld theory, especially its duality, see [2].
