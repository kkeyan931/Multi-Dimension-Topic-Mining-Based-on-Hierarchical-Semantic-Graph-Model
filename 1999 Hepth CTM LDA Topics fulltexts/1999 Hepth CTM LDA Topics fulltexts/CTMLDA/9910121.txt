(as matter fact, clear chiral uncharged singular vectors |i(0)g,q framework authors since completely ignored). furthermore authors claim massive topological submodules generated maximally (i.e.

no-label singular vectors (and many descendants) viewed pieces left outside topological massive submodules. precise, no-label submodules contain one topological one massive submodule, starting bottom, no-label singular vector, many descendants, belong submodules. result massive topological submodules together build whole no-label submodule. consequently, non-conventional singular vectors together generate maximal no-label submodule (not even bottom!). next subsection give another argument showing dierent way non-conventional singular vectors generate maximal submodules: one nd subsingular

bottom verma modules submodules ramond topological n=2 algebras two h.w. vectors two singular vectors, respectively, fermionic zero modes interpolating them. addition, one nd indecomposable singular vectors annihilated fermionic zero modes, also must called singular vectors following conventional denition {$9807234$}. second, let us also notice break symmetry g q sectors, regarding singular vectors q-sector simply descendant states (non-singular) singular vectors g-sector, leads confusion case zero conformal weight + l = 0. reason + l = 0 q0-closed (non-chiral) singular vectors |i(q)q l=

result, (see details ref. l= 10 since descendant states singular vector |i(q+1)g,q , way around, singular vectors q-sector |i(q)q l= must called subsingular vectors instead. similar reasons, indecomposable no-label singular vectors must also called subsingular vectors (they descendants singular vectors g-sector, way around, singular denition). l= see explicit examples subsingular vectors given ref. , singular chiral verma modules, complete classication subsingular vectors presented semikhatov tipunin ref. {$9704111$}. consequence deduce non-conventional singular vectors constructed refs. {$9512079$}{$9602166$} generate maximal submodules. authors classied generic verma modules built g0-closed h.w. vectors (massive verma modules) according whether zero, one, two singular vectors uncharged and/or charged series associated roots determinant formula (in notation fr,s(, h, t) = 0 and/or g k (, h, t) = 0). every case applied assumption two types submodules massive topological generated maximally non-conventional singular vectors constructed refs. {$9512079$}{$9602166$}. namely, one twisted topological non-conventional singular vector (where mean twisted spectral ows) assumed generate maximally one topological submodule whereas one twisted massive non-conventional singular vector assumed generate maximally one massive submodule. pointed before, objects null states general located bottom submodules unlike conventional singular vectors. fact, cases lie bottom coincide conventional singular vectors. important remark twisted topological h.w. conditions satised twisted topological non-conventional singular vectors reduce chirality h.w. conditions (i.e. annihilation g0, q0 positive generators) case twist parameter equal zero. result, zero twist topological non-conventional singular vectors coincide chiral charged conventional singular vectors bottom topological submodules. claim non-conventional singular vectors generate maximal submodules implies acting lowering raising operators algebra one generates whole submodules without null states left outside, subsingular vectors descendants them, pulled inside submodules action algebra. using assumptions simple geometrical arguments, authors deduced cases conventional singular vectors bottom submodules generate maximal submodules, remaining pieces outside generated subsingular vectors.
