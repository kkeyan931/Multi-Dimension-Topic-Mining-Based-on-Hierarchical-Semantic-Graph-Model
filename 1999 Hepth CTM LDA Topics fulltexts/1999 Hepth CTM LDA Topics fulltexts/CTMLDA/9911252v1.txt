abstract. we discuss some possible relationships in gauge theories, string the-
ory and m theory in the light of some recent results obtained in gauge invariant
supersymmetric quantum mechanics. in particular this reveals a new relationship
between the gauge group e8 and 11-dimensional space.

a long time ago it was proposed by eguchi and kawai [1] that the dynamics of a
four dimensional su(n) lattice gauge theory at large n could be described by the
same su(n) gauge theory on a single hyperube with periodic boundary conditions.
somehow the extensive nature of space time in such a theory is not important, at
least in the large n limit. the eguchi kawai model turned out to have a number of
problems which required various modications and it has never yielded a systematic
way of solving lattice gauge theories in general. however the idea is clearly appealing,
especially in the context of modern developments in which eld theories in dierent
numbers of space-time dimensions are related by the compactication of some of
the dimensions; the eguchi kawai model is simply su(n) lattice gauge theory
compactied on t 4 with the compactication radius sent to zero (or rather one
lattice spacing). one practical diculty with this is precisely that in a lattice theory
one cannot continuously vary the compactication radius by changing the lattice
size; really we want to keep the lattice size xed and vary the correlation length
so that the size of the box occupied by the continuum eective theory is sent to
zero. perhaps it would be simpler to deal with a continuum theory from the outset.
one might suspect that one crucial dierence between the modern compactication
relations and the eguchi kawai model is supersymmetry; this ensures that the
energy of the ground state does not diverge under compactication and seems (at
least from the technical point of view) to be a vital ingredient in demonstrating the
network of dualities relating dierent string theories and m-theory.

in a recent paper kac and smilga [2] have analyzed the zero mode structure of
the supersymmetric quantum mechanics (sqm) obtained by dimensionally reducing
d = 3 + 1 dimensional n = 4 to supersymmetric yang-mills eld theory (sym)
with gauge group g to d = 0 + 1. in turn the d = 3 + 1 theory can be regarded
as the dimensional reduction of d = 9 + 1 n = 1 sym. the dynamics of this sqm
had been rst analysed in [3], [4]. the sqm theory is known to have a continuous
spectrum with states of all energies e from zero (as guaranteed by supersymmetry)
upwards; these states are not normalizable. there is also a discrete spectrum of
normalized e = 0 states.
if the gauge group g = su(n) then it is known [5]
that the sqm hamiltonian can be regarded as describing the regularized quantum
11-dimensional supermembrane (see for example [6] and references therein) in the
light-cone gauge just as ordinary su(n) qm emerges in the light-cone quantization
of the bosonic membrane [7]. it was shown in [8] that the spectrum of su(n) sqm
is continuous which kills the old (i.e. rst quantized ) supermembrane. however,
this is precisely the property which is necessary in a matrix formulation of m-theory
[9] where n in su(n) is related to the number of parton d0 branes in a light-cone
formulation of m-theory in a at background. more about m-theory and matrix

theory can be found in [10], [11] and [12] and references therein.

if the sqm is to work as a formulation of m-theory then it is crucial that there
is only one e = 0 ground state and much eort has gone into investigating this.
the proof was given for su(2) in [13], and a lot of evidence accumulated for su(n)
[14]. kac and smilga have now shown that this is indeed the case for all su(n) and
u(n) gauge groups. however their results are much more far reaching and show
that the other classical groups, so(n), sp(2r), and the exceptional groups, have a
much richer structure of e = 0 modes.

consider a d = d + 1 sym theory with the d spatial dimensions forming a
compact manifold with isometry group e and scale (compactication scale) size .
we can dimensionally reduce the theory to sqm by sending  to zero. in doing so
we lose the isometry group as a symmetry of the theory. however we also create
a vector space of ng e = 0 modes which we will denote {|0, ii, i = 1 . . . ng}; note
that these states are time-independent because e = 0 and can therefore be regarded
as forming a real vector space not a complex one. a general zero energy state can
then be written

ng

the normalization condition applied to |xi gives the constraint

|xi =

xi=1

x i|0, ii.

1 =

ng

xi=1

x ix i

(1)

(2)

and thus the x i live on the sphere sng1. thus the destruction of the original
isometry group e by the dimensional reduction is accompanied by the emergence of
a new one, e  = so(ng). we propose that if e  e  then the process of compacti-
cation and reduction is continuous (ie the original d dimensional manifold ows into
the new one) and the sqm is equivalent to the original eld theory; in this sense
such models provide a realization of the eguchi kawai idea.

from the rules given by kac and smilga we list in table 1 the simple groups
which have (possibly) physically interesting values of ng. if we dimensionally reduce
d = 3 + 1 n = 4 sym compactied on s 3 then we see from the table that there
are three possible simple g with ng = 4 which will reproduce the s 3. in addition
there is a substantial number of direct products made up from pairs of groups with
ng = 2. for d = 9 + 1 n = 1 sym compactied on s 9 there is only one possible
simple group, sp(20), but again many direct product groups with one member taken
from the ng = 2 list and the other from the ng = 5 list.

the groups involved in this dimensional reduction do not seem to have any
particular physical signicance; it could be pure numerology, just a mathematical

game. however, let us now take d = 10 + 1 = 11 and we see there are two groups
so(24) and e8. we have here a very surprising and striking fact - the group e8
knows about 11 dimensions!

there is a natural place for e8 in string theory - through the heterotic construc-
tion and narain compactication [16] - roughly speaking this appears as a group
with self-dual and even root lattice 3. the fact that these lattices exist in dimen-
sions 0(mod8) ts nicely with the fact that the critical dimensions of bosonic and
fermionic strings are 26 and 10 and the dierence ts the group e8 e8 (also so(32)
of course, but for so(32) one may have open strings contrary to e8  e8). the fact
that this group can be obtained in closed string theory which is nite guarantees
that the green-schwarz mechanism [18] of anomaly cancellation works. let us note
that in narain toroidal compactication of heterotic string on a lattice 26d,10d
with d < 10 [17] one may get other groups - but in this case the space has a smaller
symmetry so(d).

now consider the horava-witten construction [19] of heterotic m-theory. here
the ten-dimensional e8  e8 heterotic string is related to an eleven-dimensional
theory on the orbifold r10 s 1/z2 and the presence of 10-dimensional boundaries of
11-dimensional space leads to the existence of an e8 gauge group on each boundary
in order to cancel dieomorphism anomalies. however it seems that e8 is not
directly related to 11 dimensions and knows nothing about the maximal lorentz
group so(11). but now we should take account of this new information about e8
sqm. consider heterotic m-theory on a space r1  t 9  s 1/z2 - each e8 gauge
theory is on a 9-torus t 9 and the r1 factor is time. let the radii of the torus be
ri = ir, i = 1 . . . 9 where the i are conformal factors and consider the limit r  0.
we get a 1 + 1 dimensional theory on the orbifold s 1/z2. this theory contains the
conformal factors of t 9 whose quantum mechanics is trivial, and two-dimensional

3we are not going to discuss so(24) beyond pointing out that it is the spatial symmetry group
of the critical bosonic string in light-cone gauge but the relation between 11 dimensions and bosonic
strings is unclear to us for now.

gravity with a copy of e8 sqm at each of the two singular points on the orbifold. it is
tempting to argue that the two-dimensional gravity is non-dynamical and therefore
we are just left with the two copies of e8 sqm each with an so(11) isometry group
on their zero energy normalizable subspace; note that this would not depend on the
value r11.
if r11 is small we have weakly coupled string theory compactied on
a shrinking torus, and if it is large we have the strong coupling limit. however it
seems to us that the conclusion that there are two so(11) isometry groups cannot
be true and that in fact the gravity must somehow mediate a coupling between the
boundaries so that the quantum theory has only one so(11) symmetry. our reason
for this is a string theory argument that we give in the next paragraph.

string theory on t 9 which is shrunk to a point is t -dual to an innitely large
torus, i.e. essentially r9. since the theory on t 9 is heterotic so is the t -dual theory
on r9 (in contrast to non-heterotic m-theory where d = 11 supergravity corresponds
to the strongly coupled iia string [10] and the t-dual transforms it into type iib).
now under t -duality we have that,

r  r =

1
r

,

gs  gs = gss r

r

=

gs
r

(3)

so when r  0 we see that r   and r11  gs  . thus string theory
arguments show that we should recover the so(11) symmetry. however if we started
from strong coupling from the very beginning we can not apply string arguments,
but this is precisely the situation discussed in the previous paragraph.

the group so(11) we get is hypothetically the full lorentz group of m-theory.
because the membrane lorentz algebra is dened in light-cone gauge we have to
check that there is full lorentz invariance just as in a light-cone string theory. the
classical lorentz algebra becomes closed only in the n   limit, and quantum-
mechanically it is still unknown if d = 11 is a critical dimension. although the
full quantum commutator is still unknown, it has been shown that the lowest non-
trivial anomalous terms in the commutators [m  i, m  j] are zero [20]. the so(11)
in the case of r10  s 1/z2 there is an
should be an exact quantum symmetry.
obvious so(10)  p (10) where p (10) denotes the poincare symmetry. the full
p (11) is broken by the existence of the orbifold planes. this group is nothing but
a contraction of the full so(11); in a picture of two concentric 10-spheres the full
so(11) acts faithfully on the space between them.

if we consider matrix theory on a nine-dimensional thorus we have instead of
0 + 1 sqm a fully edged 9 + 1 sym - again this theory only has a maximal so(10)
lorentz symmetry, but if we add 9+1 dimensional e8 theory and reduced the system
as a whole again to 0+1 the full so(11) symmetry will be produced by the e8 sqm.

we have argued that the two e8s should produce only one so(11). suppose this
is wrong; is there any other interpretation? a generic state for e8  e8 theory has
the form

11

|x, y i =

xi,j=1

x iy j|0, ii1|0, ji2 = |xi1|y i2

(4)

which looks like we have r11  r11 = r121 - not at all what we are looking for. a
possible loophole is to consider instead of states |xi1|y i2 operators |xihy |. this
simply means that the second hilbert space we consider as a conjugate to the rst
one and the quantum mechanical description is given by a density matrix

(x, y ) =

11

xi,j=1

x iy j|0, iih0, j|

(5)

this is actually a very nice picture because so far we have no idea how even to start
to construct dynamics on this 10-dimensional sphere. but now if we have the space
of non-trivial ground states in e8 providing coordinates, and momenta being the
cotangent bundle to this space, we can at least formulate the canonical symplectic
form

 = dpi  dqi

(6)

and start to develop the dynamics. for normalised wave functions the phase space
is going to be s 10  t s 10, so two boundaries of 11-dimensional space in heterotic
m-theory play the role of two coordinates in the density matrix (x + , x  ) a
phase space of some dual theory which has exact so(11) symmetry. the dierence
between the coordinates  is parametrised by the tangent bundle to s 10 and one
can see from a wigner function that a momentum is dual to this dierence which
justies the structure of phase space. how to nd a hamiltonian on this phase space
and formulate a dynamics is a question which remains to be answered!

we would like to thank andre smilga for telling us about the results of [2] and

the pparc fast travel fund for supporting his visit here.
