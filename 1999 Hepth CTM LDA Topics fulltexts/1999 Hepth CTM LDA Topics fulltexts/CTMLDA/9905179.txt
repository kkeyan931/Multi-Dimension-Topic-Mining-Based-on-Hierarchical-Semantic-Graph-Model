x0 < 0: < 0 hence x2 x2 fw+(e, f ) = {x : x2 = r2, xs < |xd|, x0 > 0}. dividing (x0, ~x) x = xd xs , obtain boundary region i+(e, f ) = {y = (y0, ~y) : y2 0 ~y2 > 0, y0 > 0}, is, future light-cone

set double-cones cm1,s1, map surjective. finally, since w+(e, f ) i+(e, f ) stabilizer subgroup so0(2, s), also injective. completes proof lemma. (cid:3) 2.2 proof corollaries identify wedge algebras ads1,s double-cone algebras cm1,s1 b(w(e, f )) = a(i(e, f )), is, b(w ) = a((w )). lemma implies given isotonous, causal conformally covariant net algebras cm1,s1, b(w ) dened identi- cation constitute isotonous, causal anti-desitter covariant net algebras ads1,s, vice versa. namely, identication relabelling index set net preserves inclusions causal complements intertwines action so0(2, s). thus established corollary 1. (cid:3) corollary 2, note that, algebras identied, states representations nets b also identied. since identication intertwines action anti-dsitter group conformal group, anti-desitter invariant state b corresponds conformally invariant state a. generator time translations anti-desitter group corresponds generator 1 2 (p 0 + k 0) conformal group known positive p 0 positive (note k 0 conformally conjugate p 0). hence conditions positivity respective generators time-translations equivalent. identication states algebras, also modular groups identied. modular group modular conjugation double-cone algebras vacuum state conformally covariant quantum eld theories conformally conjugate modular group modular conjugation minkowski space wedge algebra, turn given lorentz boosts wedge direction reection along ridge wedge . follows modular group wedge algebra anti-desitter space given corresponding subgroup anti-desitter group preserves wedge (for wedge w+(e, f ), subgroup boosts e-f -plane), modular conjugation cpt transformation maps w+ onto w. remarks suce complete proof corollary 2.
