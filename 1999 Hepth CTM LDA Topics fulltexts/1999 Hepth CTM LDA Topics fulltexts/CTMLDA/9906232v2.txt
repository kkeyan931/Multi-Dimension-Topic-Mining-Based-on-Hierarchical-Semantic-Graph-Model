abstract

we study the dynamics of the probe fundamental string in the eld background
of the partially localized supergravity solution for the fundamental string ending on
dp-brane. we separately analyze the probe dynamics for its motion along the world-
volume direction and the transverse direction of the source dp-brane. we compare the
dynamics of the probe along the dp-brane worldvolume direction to the bion dynamics.

1 introduction

the source and probe method has been useful for studying the bound states of branes.
in this method, it is assumed that the source brane is much heavier than the probe
brane. thus, although the probe is under the inuence of the elds produced by the
source, the probe has no inuence on the source eld conguration. so, the source
and probe system is described by the dirac-born-infeld (dbi) or the nambu-goto
(nb) action of the probe brane in the static eld background of the source brane.
such method has been successful in reproducing the brane intersection rules [1] and in
studying some dynamics or statistical mechanics of branes, e.g. refs. [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

the source and probe method is useful especially when one wants to study intersect-
ing brane conguration, since completely localized supergravity solution for intersecting
branes are not yet available. note, for delocalized supergravity solutions, a constituent
brane is not localized on the worldvolume of the other constituent. so, delocalized
solutions are not useful for studying, for example, the dynamics of a brane constituent
within the worldvolume of another brane constituent. for such study, one lets one
constituent to be the probe and another constituent to be the static background in
which the probe moves. however, this method cannot be applied if one also wants to
study the interaction among branes of the same type while these branes move in the
background of brane of another type. it is the purpose of this paper to study such
case.

in refs. [7, 8, 9, 10], various types of (partially) localized supergravity solutions for
intersecting branes in the core region of one constituent brane are constructed. for
such solutions, one constituent is localized on the worldvolume of the other constituent
(while the latter brane is delocalized on the former brane), provided that some of the
overall transverse directions are delocalized in some cases. in this paper, we study the
dynamics of the (localized) former type of brane (brane 1), which not only interacts
with the (delocalized) other type of brane (brane 2) but also interacts with another
brane 1. one can describe such dynamics with the dbi or the ng action of the brane
1 in the background eld conguration of partially localized intersecting brane 1 and
brane 2, where brane 1 is localized on brane 2.

one can apply this method to study the dynamics for any type of intersecting brane
congurations by using the partially localized intersecting brane solutions and applying
the similar procedure as the work of this paper. but we will restrict our study to the
case of the fundamental strings ending on dp-brane, because for this case the dynamics
of the corresponding worldvolume solitons, i.e. the bions [11, 12], is relatively well-
understood, e.g. refs. [13, 14, 15]. as we will see in the following section, we however
nd disagreement in dynamics of the probe fundamental string with the dynamics of
bions. this seems to be due to the fact that the supergravity solutions for intersecting

1

branes used in this paper is not fully localized ones. namely, for the partially localized
intersecting brane solutions used in this paper, the location of dp-brane along the
longitudinal direction of the fundamental string is not specied, whereas the scalar eld
of the bion solution species such location. also, it might be due to the dierence in
approximations used in the calculation of brane dynamics in the source-probe method
and the worldvolume soliton method. however, the comparison of supergravity and
worldvolume aspects of brane dynamics discussed in this paper may turn out to be
useful in other relevant studies and when fully localized solutions are available.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we summarize the partially localized
supergravity solution for the fundamental string ending on dp-brane. in section 3, we
study the dynamics of the probe fundamental string in this supergravity background,
closely following the previous works [2, 5] on the dynamics of the probe branes. we con-
sider the cases where probe fundamental string moves along the longitudinal direction
and the transverse direction of the source dp-brane, separately.

2 partially localized supergravity solution for the

fundamental string ending on dp-brane

in this section, we summarize the partially localized supergravity solution for the funda-
mental string ending on dp-brane 2 constructed in ref. [8]. the string-frame eective
supergravity action for such conguration is given by

s =

1

16g10 z d10xg[e2(r + 4m m  

1
12|h3|3)

2(p + 2)!|fp+2|2],

(1)

where g and r are respectively the determinant and the ricci scalar of the spacetime
metric gm n (m, n = 0, 1, ..., 9) in the string frame,  is the dilaton, h3 is the eld
strength for the the 2-form potential bm n in the ns-ns sector, and fp+2 is the eld
strength for the (p + 1)-form potential am1mp+1 in the r-r sector. for the p = 2 case,
there is an additional chern-simon term  m1m10bm1m2m3am4m5m6m7am8m9m10
in the action.

the supergravity solution has the following form 3:

gm n dxm dxn = h 1

2of course, this supergravity solution does not strictly correspond to the fundamental string end-
ing on dp-brane, but rather corresponds to the fundamental string piercing through dp-brane. but
at this moment, this supergravity solution is the closest that we have.

where the harmonic functions for the fundamental string and the dp-brane in the near

(3)

note, these harmonic functions describe the localized fundamental strings on the dp-
brane only for the p = 5 case. (when p = 6, the harmonic function hp is logarithmic
and therefore this supergravity solution is not valid. for the p = 7 case, the spacetime
is not asymptotically at.) for the p < 5 case, one has to delocalize 5 p of the overall
transverse directions in order to localize the fundamental strings on the dp-brane.
harmonic functions for this case are given by

hf = 1 +xi

(4)

note, in the expressions for harmonic functions in eq. (4), ~z is the part of overall
transverse coordinates where the branes are localized. namely, ~z in eq. (4) is three-
dimensional.

in this paper, we consider the case in which all the fundamental strings coincide at the
origin of the dp-brane worldvolume space (i.e. ~x0 i = ~0, for all i) and the fundamental
strings and the dp-brane meet at the origin of the overall transverse space (i.e. ~z0 = ~0).
the harmonic functions (3) in this case take the following forms:

3 dynamics of the probe fundamental string

in this section, we study the dynamics of the probe fundamental string that moves in
the background of the source fundamental string ending on the source dp-brane with
the eld conguration given by eq. (2). we will assume that (i) the source brane is
much heavier than the probe brane, i.e. there are large numbers of coinciding source
fundamental strings and source dp-branes, and (ii) the velocity of the probe funda-
mental string is very small and changes very slowly. based on the rst assumption, we
neglect the backreaction on the source due to the moving probe. the second assump-
tion implies that the radiation will be negligible, allowing quasistatic evolution of the
system which is described by the geodesic motion in the moduli space.

3

the action for the probe fundamental string with the tension tf moving in the curved

background is given by the following nambu-goto action:

s = z d dl = tf z d d(cid:20)q det gab +

1
2!

ab bab(cid:21) ,

(6)

where gab and bab (a, b = , ) are respectively the pull-backs of the spacetime metric
gm n and the ns-ns 2-form potential bm n to the worldvolume of the fundamental
string, namely

gab  gm n ax m bx n ,

bab  bm n ax m bx n .

(7)

in the static gauge (x 0 =  and x 1 =  with x 1 being the longitudinal coordinate of
the fundamental string), the pull-backs take the following forms:

gab = gab + gijax ibx j,

bab = bab + bajbx j + bibax i,

(8)

where scalars x i are the target space coordinates for the transverse space of the fun-
damental string.

note, the above action (6) describes the probe fundamental string moving in the
background of elds produced by the source brane conguration. namely, gm n and
bm n in eqs. (6) and (7) are the elds in eq. (2) produced by the source. also, in the
supergravity solution (2), the coordinates ~x, y and ~z correspond to the target space
coordinates ~x of the probe fundamental string and are assumed to be functions of time
 = x 0 only, i.e. ~x = ~x( ). namely, the probe fundamental string moves in the source
background without oscillating. therefore, the probe action (6) takes the following
form:

s = tf z d d"r(h 1

(9)

where vk and v are respectively the speeds of the probe fundamental string in the
longitudinal direction ~x and the transverse direction ~z of the dp-brane:

vk  vuut

p

xi=1

dxi
d

)2,

v  vuut

8p

(

xk=1

)2.

(10)

since the conguration under consideration is assumed to be independent of the longi-
tudinal coordinate x 1 =  of the fundamental string, the integration (with the possible

4

regularization) with respect to  in eq. (9) just gives the volume factor, which com-
bines with the tension tf of the probe fundamental string to give the mass mf of the
probe fundamental string in the third line in eq.
(9). so, the above probe action
s eectively describes the dynamics of a test particle with mass mf moving in the
background elds.

in the core region of the fundamental string and the dp-brane (x  0 and z  0) or
in the large source charge limit (qf  1 and qp  1), the harmonic functions in the
action (9) have the following forms:

qf

,

qf

(x2+4q5z)

hf = 


in the case of the delocalized intersecting source conguration, the harmonic functions
have the following forms:

hf = 1 +

qf
z6p , hp = 1 +

qp
z6p ,

(12)

where the constant terms 1 in the harmonic functions are absent in the near horizon
region (z  0). note, in the partially localized case with the harmonic functions
given by eq.(11), unlike the delocalized case with the harmonic functions (12), the
background geometry has the explicit dependence on the radial coordinate x of the
worldvolume space of the dp-brane. this makes the study of non-trivial dynamics of
the probe fundamental string in the relative transverse space possible.

so, explicitly in terms of the parameters of the source supergravity solution, the
probe action (9) in the core region of the constituent source branes takes the following
form:

s = mf z d

(x2 + 4qpz)

(14)

these actions for the probe fundamental string eectively describe the dynamics of
a particle with mass mf moving in a velocity dependent potential. when the motion
of the probe is restricted either to the relative transverse space (with the coordinates
~x) or to the overall transverse space (with the coordinates ~z) of the source brane
conguration, the force on the particle becomes central, as well.

5

for the purpose of analyzing this motion, we set all the angular momenta of the probe
except one in each space (jk 6= 0 in the relative transverse space and j 6= 0 in the
overall transverse space) equal to zero. and one introduces the polar coordinates (x, k)
and (z, ) in the rotation planes respectively associated with the angular momenta jk
and j. then, the velocities vk and v in the relative transverse space and the overall
transverse space, dened in eq. (10), are decomposed as

k = x2 + x2 2
v2
k,

 = z2 + z2 2
v2

(15)

where the dot denotes the dierentiation with respect to the time coordinate  .

then, in general, the angular momenta jk and j and the energy e of the probe

are given by

3.1 the motion of the probe fundamental string in the relative

transverse space

in this subsection, we study the dynamics of the probe fundamental string whose mo-
tion is restricted to the relative transverse space of the source brane conguration. in
this case, v = 0 and the coordinate z is constant in time. generally, the angular mo-
mentum jk in the relative transverse space and the energy e of the probe fundamental
string have the following forms:

jk =

e =

so, explicitly the angular momentum and the energy for each case are as follows:

from the above expression for the energy e of the probe fundamental string, one

obtains the following kinetic relation:

(22)

where the harmonic function hf is given by eq. (11) or eq. (12). by further using
the expression for the angular momentum jk in eq. (19), one obtains the following
kinetic relation for the radial motion of the probe:

e =

v (x) = e[1

so, the radial motion (along the x direction) of the probe is that of the test particle
with mass mf moving in a velocity-independent central force potential v (x).

in the partially localized case, the eective potential v (x) is explicitly given by

v (x) = e[1

(24)

(25)

where n = 6 [n = 7] for p < 5 [p = 5].

the dynamics of the probe fundamental string along the radial direction x can be
studied by analyzing an eective velocity-dependent central force potential v (x) in
eq. (23). in the delocalized source background with the harmonic function hf in
eq.
(12) being independent of the radial coordinate x, the dynamics of the probe
fundamental string in the worldvolume space of the dp-brane is trivial: the only force
on the probe is the repulsive centrifugal force due to non-zero angular momentum jk
of the probe. however, with the partially localized source background, one can study
non-trivial dynamics of the probe fundamental string since the source fundamental
string is now localized on the source dp-brane and therefore the eective potential
v (x) in eq. (24) has explicit dependence on x.

at large distance x  b from the source fundamental string, the eective potential

in eq. (24) takes the following form:

vxb

(26)

so, the motion of the probe fundamental string is qualitatively similar to the motion in
the background of the source fundamental string only, except that the strength of the
repulsive potential (the rst term in eq. (26)) is decreased due to the presence of the
source dp-brane. this contribution from the source dp-brane gets enhanced for larger
dp-brane charge qp and at larger distance z from the source dp-brane. however, the

8

centrifugal potential (the second term) remains the same regardless of the presence of
the source dp-brane.

at short distance x  b from the source fundamental string and very close to the

source dp-brane (z  b2/qp), the eective potential is approximated to

the (energy e independent) repulsive potential term is enhanced again due to the
presence of the source dp-brane:
for larger qp and z, the repulsive force becomes
stronger. unlike the case of the long distance region, the probe fundamental string
now feels the eect of the source dp-brane on the centrifugal potential when the probe
fundamental string gets very close to the source.

we now discuss the motion of the probe fundamental string in the source background.
the turning points, where the radial velocity x of the probe becomes zero, are located
at the values of x where e = v (x) (cf. eq. (23)) and therefore are the roots of the
following equation:

1 +

2(x2 + 4qpz)

b2

x2 ,

(28)

where b is given in eq. (25), b  jk/q2mf e and again n = 6 [n = 7] for p < 5

[p = 5]. this equation always has one positive root x for non-zero angular momentum
jk of the probe. and when jk = 0, there is no root x for this equation. furthermore,
the radial force f (x) =  dv (x)
on the probe diverges as x  0, when jk 6= 0. on the
other hand, when the angular momentum jk is zero, the force vanishes at x = 0. so,
the motion of the probe fundamental string can be summarised as follows. when the
probe has non-zero angular momentum, the probe will always be scattered away when
it reaches the source fundamental string. when the probe has no angular momentum,
it will eventually be absorbed by the source.

dx

in the following, we compare the dynamics of the bions, which is previously studied
in refs.
[13, 14, 15], to the dynamics of the probe fundamental string along the
worldvolume direction of the d-brane studied in the above paragraphs. it is natural to
expect that these two systems have the same dynamics, since the bions in the (p + 1)-
dimensional dbi theory are interpreted as the ends of fundamental strings on dp-brane
in the very weak string coupling limit (gs  0). namely, the motion of the ends of
the fundamental strings on the d-brane along the d-brane worldvolume direction is
essentially the motion of the bions. however, as we shall see in the following, our
description of dynamics of the probe fundamental string studied in the above is too
simplied to reproduce the dynamics of the worldvolume solitons, i.e. bions.

in the following, we summarize the dynamics of the bions, studied in refs. [13, 14,
15], for the purpose of comparing the dynamics of bions to the dynamics of the probe

9

a0 = h, x = h; h = xk

|~  ~xk|p2 ,

qk

(31)

and for the purpose of xing the notations. the (p + 1)-dimensional dbi action has
the following form:

sdbi = z dp+1q det(m n x m x n + f),

(29)

where m n (m, n = 0, 1, ..., 9) is the metric for the minkowskian target space and
f = a  a (,  = 0, 1, ..., p) is the eld strength of the worldvolume u(1)
in the static gauge, in which the worldvolume coordinates  are
gauge eld a.
identied with the target space coordinates as  = x  ((x m ) = (x , x m) with
m = p + 1, ..., 9), the dbi action (29) takes the following form:

sdbi = z dp+1q det( + x mx m + f).

(30)

the ends of the fundamental strings on the dp-brane worldvolume correspond to
the bions which carry the electric charge of the worldvolume u(1) gauge eld a. one
scalar, say x := x p+1, associated with the longitudinal direction of the fundamental
string in the target space is non-trivial. in general, the bion solution has the following
form [11, 12]:

where ~ = (1, ..., p) is the spatial components of the worldvolume coordinates () =
(, ~) and ~xk is the location of a bion with the electric charge qk in the worldvolume
space.

since we are interested in the low velocity dynamics of bions, it is sucient to

consider the following linearized approximation to the dbi action (30):

(32)

where in the second line only one scalar x associated with the longitudinal direction
of the attached fundamental string is kept.

to study the dynamics of the bions, we allow the locations of the bions to change
with time, i.e. ~xk = ~xk( ). so, ~vk = d~xk( )
is the velocity of the k-th bion with the
electric charge qk. one has to also add the following source term ssource for the bi u(1)
eld a and scalar eld x, and the free term sfree for the bions:

where p1 = 2
the regularized mass of the k-th bion. here,  is the cut-o for the radial distance
from the bions, i.e. we restrict ourselves to the region |~  ~xk|  . then, mk()
corresponds to the mass of the fundamental string whose length is truncated due to
the regularization [11]. the source term can be interpreted as being related to the
bulk supergravity conguration. namely, the dp-brane, whose shape in the (x, x)-
plane is given by x(x), is the source of the rst term in ssource, and the the end of
the fundamental string on the dp-brane is the source of the worldvolume u(1) gauge
eld a (the second term in ssource describes such coupling). sfree is the action for the
bions with masses mk().

note, since the bions, which carry electric charges, have non-zero velocities, the
magnetic eld is induced and the velocity dependent force will also be induced. to
study such and other eects on the bion dynamics due to non-zero velocities, one
perturbs the elds around the static conguration (31). then, one substitutes the
perturbed elds, which satisfy the equations of motion to the order o(v2) in the velocity
v of the bions, into the action s = sdbi + ssource + sfree in order to obtain the following
on-shell eective action for the bions to the order o(v2) [13, 14, 15]:

(2) with eq.

the system of the probe fundamental string (with the action (6)) moving in the
source background, given by eq.
(5), is the bulk counterpart to the
dynamic system of two bions in the (p + 1)-dimensional dbi theory. in this case, the
indices k and  in eqs. (31) and (34) run from 1 to 2. we let the rst [second] bion
correspond to the probe [the source] fundamental string. this is a two-body system
under a central force. such system can be reduced to an equivalent one-body system
by replacing the positions ~x1 and ~x2 of the bions by their center-of-mass position
~r = (m1~x1 + m2~x2)/(m1 + m2) and relative position ~r = ~x1  ~x2. the action (34) then
transforms to the following form:

p  2

p1z d [mv 2 + v2 + (p  2)p1

(35)

where m = m1 + m2 is the total mass,  = m1m2/m is the reduced mass, v = | d ~r
d |
is the center-of-mass velocity, and v = | d~r
d | is the relative velocity. thus, the motion
of bions is described by the geodesic motion in the moduli space with the following
metric:

m s = md ~r2 + [ + (p  2)p1
ds2

11

q1q2
rp2 ]d~r2.

(36)

as expected, the center-of-mass moves freely but the relative motion of the bions
is under the inuence of a velocity dependent central potential. since the source
fundamental string is assumed to be much heavier than the probe fundamental string,
the second bion is much heavier than the rst bion, i.e. m1  m2. then, the action
(35) in the center-of-mass coordinate system (~v = ~0) is approximated to 4:

p  2

(37)

which describes dynamics of the rst bion in the background of the second bion, which
is xed in space.

in order to compare the above result for the bion dynamics to the bulk theory
result, one has to obtain the velocity dependent potential from the energy e of the
probe fundamental string in eq. (20). in the limit of very small probe velocity (vk  0),
the energy e of the probe fundamental string in eq. (20) is expanded in powers of the
velocity as

e =

and, therefore, to the leading order in vk, the velocity dependent potential on the probe
is

.

(39)

this expression for the eective potential on the probe fundamental string has dif-
ferent dependence on the velocity vk and the radial coordinate x from the eective
potential on the light bion given in eq. (37). in addition, one also nds disagreement
of the probe moduli metric, which describes the geodesic motion of the probe funda-
mental string, with the moduli metric (36) of bions, as we see in the following. in
the limit of very small probe velocity (vk  0 and v  0), the on-shell action (9) is
approximated to

s 

1
2

mf z d (v2

k + hpv2

),

(40)

to the lowest order in the velocities. the vanishing of the static potential in this on-
shell action is in accordance with the fact that we are considering a bps conguration.
from the denitions of the probe fundamental string velocities (10), one can see that
the moduli metric of the probe fundamental string is given by

ds2

f = dxidxi + hpdzkdzk.

this moduli metric implies that the probe moves freely along the worldvolume direc-
tions of the dp-brane, whereas the moduli metric (36) for the bions describes the
motion under the inuence of the velocity dependent central potential.

this disagreement may be traced from the following factors. first, in calculating
the eective action for the probe fundamental string, we assumed that the eld con-
gurations are static, uninuenced by the moving probe fundamental string. as was
done originally in refs. [16, 17, 18, 19, 20], when one studies the motion of collection
of interacting solitons (in the low-velocity limit), which is described by the geodesic
motion in the moduli space, one usually takes into account the perturbation (in a
slow-motion expansion) of the original static elds due to non-zero velocities of the
solitons. this is properly done in the case of the interaction of bions in the above,
but not in the case of the probe fundamental string moving in the source background.
namely, in the source-probe method, one assumes that source is much heavier than
the probe and therefore the source is uninuenced by the probe. on the other hand,
in the case of bion dynamics, rst we assumed that all the bions have the comparable
mass (therefore, the eld produced by one bion is inuenced by those of other bions)
and at the end we let one of the bions to be much heavier and the others. second, the
supergravity background (2) in which the probe fundamental string moves corresponds
to the conguration where the source dp-brane is delocalized along the longitudinal
direction (the y direction) of the source fundamental string. on the other hand, as
for the bion solution in eq. (31), the location of the dp-brane along the longitudinal
direction of the fundamental string is specied by the scalar x. so, although the par-
tially localized supergravity solution (2) has all the parameters of the bions, i.e. the
charges and the locations of the bions, it still lacks one special feature of the bion
solution that a scalar x of the bion solution species the location or the shape of
the dp-brane along the longitudinal direction of the fundamental string. in the fully
localized supergravity solution, one would expect to see the shape of dp-brane pulled
by the fundamental string, just like the case of the bion solution. in the case of the
congurations describing one type of brane within the worldvolume of another type of
brane, we will not encounter with this problem, since there is no relative transverse di-
rection that is delocalized. if one properly takes into account the above observations, it
might be possible to reproduce the moduli metric for the bion interaction by studying
probe fundamental string moving in the source background of the fundamental strings
ending on dp-brane.

3.2 the motion of the probe fundamental string in the overall

transverse space

in this subsection, we study the dynamics of the probe fundamental string whose
motion is restricted to the overall transverse space.
in this case, vk = 0 and the
coordinate x is constant in time. generally, the angular momentum j in the overall
transverse space and the energy e of the probe fundamental string have the following
forms:

j =

,

e =

mf hpz2 
q1  hphf v2



 1
 .

mf

hf 


1

q1  hphf v2



(42)

(43)

(44)

so, the explicit expressions for the angular momentum and the energy are

j =

e =

mf qpz 
r1  qpqf v2


z(x2+4qpz)

mf (x2 + 4qpz)

where n = 6 [n = 7] for p < 5 [p = 5], and

j =

r1  qpqf v2



mf z6p

for the delocalized case.

from the above expression for the energy e of the probe fundamental string, one

obtains the following kinetic relation:

e =

mf v2

 + w (z); w (z) = e[1 

1
hp

1 + e
2mf
(1 + e
mf

],

(45)

where the harmonic functions hf and hp are given in eqs. (11) and (12). further using
the expression for the angular momentum j in eq. (42), one obtains the following
kinetic relation for the radial motion of the probe:

e =

1
2

mf z2 + v (z);

v (z) = e[1

so, again the radial motion (along the z direction) of the probe fundamental string is
that of a test particle with mass mf moving in an eective velocity-independent central
force potential v (z).

we notice the qualitative dierence in the eective potential (therefore, the quali-
tative dierence in the dynamics of the probe) between this case and the case of the
dynamics in the relative transverse space of the source brane conguration with the
eective potential given in eq. (23). namely, whereas the eective potential for the
dynamics in the worldvolume direction of the source dp-brane is aected by the source
dp-brane only through the dp-brane charge qp in the harmonic function hf for the
source fundamental string, in the case of the dynamics in the directions transverse to
the dp-brane the eective potential explicitly depends on the harmonic function hp of
the dp-brane. this is expected from the fact that our supergravity eld background (2)
for the source is delocalized along the longitudinal direction of the fundamental string:
the probe fundamental string will feel the uniform force eld of the same strength (pro-
duced by the source dp-brane) as it moves along the dp-brane worldvolume direction.
however, the source dp-brane is in fact pulled by the source fundamental string and
therefore the probe fundamental string will feel the varying force eld of the source
dp-brane and ultimately hit the dp-brane as it moves towards the source fundamental
string along the dp-brane worldvolume direction. this force on the probe fundamental
string due to the source dp-brane is the bulk counterpart to the force on the bion due
to the scalar charge of x in eq. (31). this is one of the reasons for the mismatch of
the probe dynamics in the dp-brane worldvolume direction and the bion dynamics, as
pointed out in the previous section.

for the partially localized case, the eective potential in the core region is explicitly

given by

v (z) = [1

(50)

we now analyze the dynamics of the probe fundamental string moving along the
radial direction z of the overall transverse space. the dynamics is non-trivial for both
delocalized and partially localized cases. we study both of these cases and compare
the dierences.

at large distance z  b from the source, the eective potential v (z) in eq. (46)

takes the following form:

(52)

for the delocalized case. due to the presence of the dp-brane, the usual repulsive
potential of the source fundamental string (the part of the potential which is indepen-
dent of j) gets an additional potential contribution from the source dp-brane. in the
delocalized case (eq. (52)), the repulsive force due to the probe fundamental string is
completely screened by the source dp-brane and the probe feels the repulsive force
due to the dp-brane, only. however, when the source fundamental string is localized
at the source dp-brane, the probe feels some repulsive contribution in the eective
potential which signals existence of the source fundamental string. the (repulsive)
centrifugal potential (j dependent term) on the probe is again suppressed due to the
presence of the dp-brane and is not repulsive any more. (the term j 2
p z2 in eq. (46)

2mf h 2
becomes a standard centrifugal potential term, if the source dp-brane is absent, i.e.
hp = 1.) in the case of the partially localized case, this term does not give rise to the
force on the probe (ignoring the subleading qf dependent term). however, when the
source fundamental string is delocalized, the probe still feels a j dependent attractive
force (to the leading order, ignoring the subleading qf dependent term).

at short distance z  b from the source dp-brane and very close to the source
fundamental string (x  qqpb), the eective potential is approximated to

for the delocalized case. the usual (j independent) repulsive potential term due to
the source fundamental string is suppressed by the contribution from the source dp-
brane. again, the repulsive centrifugal potential is completely suppressed and becomes
attractive.

we now study the motion of the probe along the radial direction z of the overall
transverse space. the turning point z, where the radial velocity z vanishes, of the
probes motion is given by the root of the following equation:

1 +

(55)

where b is given in eq. (48) and b = j/q2mf e. in the delocalized case, the turning

point z satises the following equation:

1 +

b6p
2z6p =

b2

qp

z4p,

(56)

dz

/qp  b/2 (b2

where b is given in eq. (50). in the partially localized case, there is always one turning
point at positive z when j 6= 0, whereas there is no turning point for the j = 0
case. in the delocalized case, when the angular momentum is non-zero, there is (i) one
turning point at positive z for p < 4, (ii) one turning point at positive z [no turning
point] for a suciently large [small] value of j for p = 4, and (iii) one turning point
at z = b2
 > qpb/2) for p = 5, whereas there is no turning point for
the j = 0 case. furthermore, the force on the probe along the radial direction z,
i.e. f (z) =  dv (z)
, is always positive [vanishes] at z = 0 when x > 0 [x = 0] in the
partially localized case. in the delocalized case, the force always vanishes at z = 0. so,
the motion of the probe fundamental string along the z direction can be summarized
as follows. in the partially localized case, away from the source fundamental string
(x > 0), the probe fundamental string will always bounce back as it approaches the
source dp-brane, but can be eventually absorbed by the source dp-brane when the
probe approaches the dp-brane inside of the worldvolume of the source fundamental
string (x = 0). in the delocalized case, the probe with j = 0 will always be absorbed
by the source dp-brane. this seems to be due to the fact that the source fundamental
string is delocalized on the source dp-brane, i.e.
is uniformly distributed over the
worldvolume of the dp-brane. when the probe has non-zero angular momentum j,
the probe will bounce back as it approaches the dp-brane for the following cases: (i)
p < 4, (ii) the suciently large value of j with p = 4, and (iii) b2
 > qpb/2 with
p = 5. otherwise, the probe will always be absorbed by the source as it approaches
the dp-brane.
