abstract

we consider the non-abelian chern-simons term coupled to external particles, in
a gauge and dieomorphism invariant form. the classical equations of motion are
perturbativelly studied, and the on-shell action is shown to produce knot-invariants
associated with the sources. the rst contributions are explicitely calculated, and the
corresponding knot-invariants are recognized. we conclude that the interplay between
knot theory and topological field theories is manifested not only at the quantum
level, but in a classical context as well.

1 introduction

the study of quantum chern-simons theory (c.s.t.) and its relationship with knot
theory (k.t.) is an active eld of research both in mathematics and theoretical
physics [1]. the bridge between eld and knot theories was stablished when e.witten
discovered that the vacuum expectation value of the wilson loop (w.l.) yields a knot
invariant closely related with the jones polinomial [2, 3]. from a physical point of
view, this relationship has interesting applications. for instance, the knot invariants
obtained from a perturbative expansion of the w.l. average [4] provide solutions to the
constraints of ashtekar quantum gravity [5] in the loop representation [6, 7]. the
purpose of this work is to show that the interplay between c.s.t. and k.t. is man-
ifested also at the classical level. to this end, we shall develop a perturbative study
of the classsical equations of motion of the c.s.t. coupled to external point particles.
as we shall see, this study leads to the obtention of link invariants associated to the
world lines of the particles, inasmuch the calculation of the expectation value of the
w.l. does in the quantum theory. this approach was explored by the author for the
abelian case several years ago [8].

2 classical chern-simons theory

2.1 preliminaries

the su(n) action is given by

scs = kz d3x  tr(a a +

aaa)

(1)

t a. the n 2  1 generators t a are chosen so that trt at b =  1

with a = aa
2 ab and
[t a, t b] = abct c, abc being the (completelly antisymmetric) structure constants. we
shall add an interaction term

with

si = z d3x tr(aj )

j (x) =

n

xi=1

z d 3(x  z( )) z

(i)( )i(i)( )

(2)

(3)

in this expression, z
(i)( ) denotes the wold line of the i  th particle, which acts as
an externally prescribed source for the c.s. eld. indeed, since we are going to take
these world lines as closed curves in 2+1 dimensions, the analogy with point particles
holds only formally. the algebra valued object i(i)( ) = i a
(i)( )t a could be interpreted
as the color charge carried by the i  th particle. the current j (x) was introduced
by wong [9] to deal with point particles interacting with the yang-mills eld. varying
scs + si w.r.t. a produces the eld equations

2

where f = a   a + [a, a ]. consistence of eq.(4) leads to

k f = j 

dj   j  + [a, j ] = 0

(4)

(5)

suppose now that one is able to solve eqs.(4),(5) to get a = a(j), and to calculate
the on shell action sos = s[a(j)] . since both scs and si are topological terms, it
is immediate to see that sos is metric independent too. moreover, since sos depends
only on the curves z
(i)( ) , we have to conclude that it is a link-invariant associated
to the curves. of course, one cannot solve the non-linear equations (4),(5) exactly.
therefore, we shall adopt a perturbative scheme, with  = k1 being the expansion
parameter. we shall get

sos(j) =



xp=0

ps(p)(j)

(6)

and, since sos(j) is a link-invariant for all  , the same will be true for each contri-
bution s(p).

2.2 perturbative solution

next we sketch how the perturbative procedure goes on, and calculate sos explicitly
up to rst order in . it can be seen that the consistence equation (5) leads to

where

plus the gradient of an arbitrary function, which can be set equal to zero. this amounts
to chosing the gauge ba
 = 0. observe that for the rst time, a metric (the euclidean
one) appears into the discussion. this will not spoil the dieomorphism invariance of
the on-shell action, because the latter is not sensible to metric choices. it could be said
that chosing a metric to solve the equations amounts to xing a gauge, or a geometry,
that will not break the topological invariance of the geometry-independent on-shell
action. as before, there are consistence requirements which must be studied:
from

(p)
j a must be conserved. this is clearly fulled in the 0th
eq.(14) it is immediate that
order case, but as we shall discuss later, it is by no means trivial for higher orders. we
now turn to the on-shell action. we set

is the gauss linking number of the curves i, j, which is a link invariant. (there are
some subtleties about the case i = j, whose discussion is out the scope of this paper [4]).

(1)
to obtain the rst order contribution
s , we have to study the consistence of eq. (13).
taking the divergence on both sides, and after some calculations, one is lead to the
condition

j (0) l(i, j) 3(x  z(i)(0)) = 0

(19)

xi,j

where z(i)(0) is the starting point of the curve i . from the last equation we see that
a sucient condition for eq. (13) being consistent is that l(i, j) = 0  i, j. a careful
look at eq.(19) reveals that if the curves do not intersect each other, the former is
indeed a necesary condition too. under these conditions, eq.(15) gives the solution of
eq. (13), which when substituted into eq.(16) yields the rst order contribution to s

(1)

s = xi,j,k

gi,j,km (i, j, k)

(20)

where gi,j,k is a group theoretical factor and

m (i, j, k) = z d3xc(i)(x)c(j) (x)c(k)(x)

+ z d3xz d3y [ t 

(i) (x, y)c(j)(x)c(k) (y) + cyc.perm.of i, j, k] (21)

the quantity dened in eq. (21) is the triple milnors linking number [10, 11, 12]
associated to the curves i, j, k, which is known to be a link-invariant, provided the gauss
linking numbers vanish for every i, j. hence, we obtain the following nice feature: the
consistence condition for solving the rst order equation of motion, is preciselly the
condition which allows the rst order contribution to the on-shell action to coincide
with a non-trivial link-invariant. as an application of this invariant, we recall that
the borromean rings have non-vanishing m (i, j, k) while their gauss linking number
vanish [11].

3 discussion

we have presented results supporting the following claim: classical (not only quan-
tum) topological field theories are an interesting tool for the study of link invariants.
concretely, we found that the on shell action of the c.s.t. coupled with string-like
sources, admits a perturbative expansion in powers of the inverse coupling constant,
whose rst and second order contributions give respectively the gauss linking number
and the triple milnors linking number. we want to underline that our proposal and
results are completely independent of quantum considerations.
the perturbative scheme we have reported could certainly be carried out further. we
conjecture that as far as the links allowed do not intersect each other, the corresponding
higher order contributions to the on-shell action will yield milnors higher-order linking
coecients. this should be compared with similar results of reference [12], obtained
within the quantum framework. it would also be interesting to study the case where
the curves intersect. these and other related issues are under work.
