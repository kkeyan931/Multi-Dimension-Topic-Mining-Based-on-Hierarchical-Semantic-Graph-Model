abstract

the irreducible brst symmetry for the freedman-townsend model
is derived. the comparison with the standard reducible approach is
also addressed.

pacs number: 11.10.ef

1 introduction

it is well-known that the hamiltonian brst formalism [1][5] stands for one
of the strongest and most popular quantization methods for theories with
rst-class constraints.
in the irreducible context the ghosts can be inter-
preted like one-forms dual to the vector elds corresponding to the rst-class
constraints. this geometrical interpretation fails within the reducible frame-
work due to the fact that the vector elds are no longer independent, hence
they cannot form a basis. the redundant behaviour generates the appear-
ance of ghosts with ghost number greater than one, traditionally called ghosts
for ghosts, of their canonical conjugated momenta, named antighosts, and,
in the meantime, of a pyramidal non-minimal sector. the ghosts for ghosts

ensure a straightforward incorporation of the reducibility relations within
the cohomology of the exterior derivative along the gauge orbits, while their
antighosts are required in order to kill the higher resolution degree nontrivial
co-cycles from the homology of the koszul-tate dierential. among the re-
ducible systems, the freedman-townsend model [6] plays a special role due
on the one hand to its link with wittens string theory [7], and, on the other
hand, to its equivalence to the non-linear -model [6]. this model was ap-
proached within the antield-brst framework [8][12] and only partially at
the hamiltonian brst level [8], but in both settings was studied along an
on-shell reducible context.

the purpose of this paper consists in proving that it is possible to quantize
the freedman-townsend model, which is an example of on-shell rst-stage
reducible hamiltonian theory, in the framework of an irreducible hamiltonian
brst procedure. the idea of replacing reducible systems by some irreducible
ones is not new. at the hamiltonian level, this idea appears in [5] and [13],
but it hasnt been either consistently developed, or applied so far to the
quantization of reducible hamiltonian systems. our treatment mainly relies
on the replacement of the on-shell rst-stage reducible hamiltonian model by
an irreducible one, and on the subsequent quantization of the resulting theory
in the hamiltonian brst context. the irreducible hamiltonian system is
completely derived from the requirement that under a suitable redenition of
the antighost number one antighosts all the antighost number one co-cycles of
the reducible koszul-tate dierential should identically vanish. this further
prevents the appearance of antighosts with antighost number two. moreover,
the reducible and irreducible systems possess the same physical observables,
hence the zeroth order cohomological groups of the corresponding brst
operators coincide. this enables us to replace the brst symmetry for the
starting reducible theory by that for the irreducible system. as a consequence
of our irreducible approach to the freedman-townsend model the ghosts for
ghosts are absent. thus, the three-ghost coupling term is discarded from
the gauge-xed action, and the corresponding gauge-xed lagrangian brst
symmetry becomes o-shell nilpotent in our procedure.

the comparison between the reducible analysis and our irreducible treat-
ment in the case of this model is instructive at emphasizing some interesting
aspects revealed by our formalism. for instance, within the reducible ap-
proach to this model the ghosts for ghosts are bosonic and display massless
scalar eld propagators, hence they are elds with correct spin-statistics re-

2

lations. on the other hand, it is well-known that in quantum eld theory the
ghosts do not describe physical particles, such that it appears necessary to
recover wrong spin-statistics relations in connection with these elds. our
method presents the nice feature that it restores this required type of wrong
relations. another interesting feature is that the emerging gauge-xed action
is manifestly lorentz covariant and displays a simpler form than the one in-
ferred within the reducible procedure, allowing thus a more straightforward
perturbative approach.
in the meantime, our irreducible analysis can be
applied to investigating the possible consistent couplings that can be intro-
duced among a system of free two-form gauge elds. the last problem was
studied in [12] accordingly the reducible background, being shown that in
four dimensions the freedman-townsend interaction vertex denes the only
consistent interaction that deforms nontrivially the gauge transformations of
free two-forms. it is possible that an irreducible approach to this matter will
reveal new aspects or enlighten other features of the already known results.
all these considerations motivate the necessity of an irreducible analysis for
the freedman-townsend model.

our paper is structured in four sections. in section 2 we realize the irre-
ducible quantization of the freedman-townsend model. initially, we derive
an irreducible theory associated with the starting reducible model by means
of some homological ideas. subsequently we prove that we can substitute the
hamiltonian brst quantization of the original redundant model by that of
the irreducible theory. in the nal part of this section we deduce the path
integral for the irreducible system in the context of the hamiltonian brst
quantization, which is found manifestly lorentz covariant. in section 3 we
realize the comparison between the gauge-xed action derived in section 2
and the usual gauge-xed action of the freedman-townsend model obtained
in the reducible antield context. section 4 ends the paper with some con-
clusions.

2 irreducible treatment of the freedman-

townsend model

in this section we construct the path integral for the freedman-townsend
model by using an irreducible hamiltonian brst procedure. we start with

3

the canonical analysis and derive some irreducible rst-class constraints as-
sociated with the reducible ones following homological arguments. next, we
obtain the irreducible brst symmetry associated with the above mentioned
irreducible constraints and reveal its relationship with the standard reducible
brst symmetry via proving that the physical observables corresponding to
the irreducible and reducible theories coincide. this makes permissible the
replacement of the hamiltonian brst quantization for the original reducible
model by that of the irreducible system. finally, we deduce the path integral
of the irreducible theory, which is found manifestly lorentz covariant.

in order to deal with the hamiltonian brst formalism, it is useful to elimi-

with respect to themselves. by passing to the dirac bracket, the constraints

r realizes an homological resolution of smooth functions dened on the
surface (9), while the model of longitudinal derivative r takes into account
the gauge invariances. the main property of r, the acyclicity, is gained via
introducing some new elds, called antighosts, and denoted by p a
(2)i and
p a. the rst two sets of antighosts are fermionic and possess the antighost
number one, while the last set is bosonic and displays the antighost number
two. the standard denitions of r on the koszul-tate generators are given
by

(1)i, p a

where za can be any of the reduced phase-space co-ordinates. the antighosts
p a are required by the acyclicity of r at antighost number one. indeed, from
(11) and (13) we nd that

a  (cid:16)di(cid:17)a

b

p b

(2)i,

(15)

are nontrivial co-cycles, which are restored trivial with the help of (14).

the basic idea of our irreducible approach consists in redening the
antighosts p a
(2)i in such a way that the new co-cycles of the type (15) vanish
identically. if we solve this problem, the antighosts p a will be discarded from
the theory, hence we get an irreducible hamiltonian system. in view of this
aim, we perform the transformation

(2)i  p a

(2)i = n aj

(16)

where n aj

multiplying (13) by n bi

(17)

(18)

which further yield the co-cycles a  (di)a
(2)i that vanish identically
due to the former relations in (17), hence (18) describe an irreducible theory.

the vanishing of these co-cycles induces the removal of the antighost number
two antighosts p a from the antighost spectrum, so it is natural to replace the
notation r by  in (18) in order to emphasize that these relations correspond
to an irreducible system. if we take

with m c
d, the relations (17) are automati-
cally fullled. it is clear that m c
d is invertible because our model is rst-stage
reducible, i.e., the equations (di)a
b ub  0 possess only trivial solutions. the
concrete form of m c
d is not important in the context of our analysis, but only
its existence in principle. substituting (19) in (18) we arrive at the relations

(20)

the last formulas describe an irreducible theory underlying some irreducible
rst-class constraints to be further determined.
in this light we add the
supplementary bosonic canonical pairs (a, a) equal in number with the
number of the reducibility relations (11), with a the non-vanishing solutions
to the equations

due to the invertibility of m a

(2)j(cid:17) 6= 0. thus, the non-vanishing solutions

enforce the irreducibility as a given by (15) are not co-cycles in this case.
obviously, the opposite situation (i.e., the trivial solutions b = 0) leads to

the equations (cid:16)(dj)a

(15), and thus of the reducibility. on behalf of (21) the relations (20) can be
written under the form

(2)j(cid:17) = 0, that reveal the appearance of the co-cycles

in this manner we associated an irreducible theory based on the irreducible
rst-class constraints (23) with the initial redundant model.

to see that the new constraints remain abelian.
lagrangian action (1) of the original reducible model is invariant under some
lorentz covariant gauge transformations [8][12]. at the hamiltonian level,
the covariant behaviour of the original gauge transformations is basically
ensured by the presence, besides the gauge parameters corresponding to the
rst-class constraints (2), of the supplementary gauge parameters associated
with the rst-stage reducibility functions appearing in the left-hand side of
(6). on the contrary, the gauge parameters available within the hamiltonian
context of our irreducible system are fewer than the original ones due to the
lack of reducibility. thus, we nd ourselves in the position to infer some non-
covariant transformations at the level of the lagrangian action underlying
the irreducible theory. in order to surpass this inconvenient and, moreover,
to derive a manifestly covariant path integral for the irreducible theory it
is necessary to enhance the eld and constraint spectrum in such a way to
preserve the irreducibility. a natural and also simple manner of realizing
this scope is to enlarge the phase-space with the canonical bosonic pairs

a , (1)a(cid:17), (cid:16)(2)
(cid:16)(1)

a , (2)a(cid:17), which we set to be constrained by

 (1)a  (1)a  0,

(2)a  (2)a  0.

known that one can always add a combination of rst-class constraints to a
rst-class constraint without aicting the theory. in this respect, we remark

(33)

as it will be further evidenced, the gauge algebra (3233) ensures the lorentz
covariance of the irreducible approach.

at this point we are in the position to construct the irreducible brst
symmetry corresponding to the irreducible theory derived so far. the min-
imal antighost spectrum of the irreducible koszul-tate dierential is orga-
nized as

p  (cid:16)p (1)a

, p (2)a

, p (1)a, p (2)a(cid:17) ,

(34)

where all the variables are fermionic of antighost number one, being associ-
ated with (2829). using the standard denitions

za = 0,

p ()a

i

, p ()a = ()a,  = 1, 2,

(35)

(36)

the koszul-tate operator is nilpotent and acyclic. the generators of the
longitudinal derivative along the gauge orbits are given by

  (cid:16)(1)i

a

, (2)i

a

, (1)

a (cid:17) ,
a , (2)

(37)

(39)

with these denitions at hand,  is strongly nilpotent. extending  to the
ghosts (37) and  to the antighosts (34) through

 = 0, p = 0,

(40)

the homological perturbation theory [15][18] guarantees that the irreducible
brst symmetry si =  +  exists and is nilpotent. to conclude with, at this
moment we managed to derive an irreducible brst symmetry associated
with the original reducible one.

2.3 relation with the reducible brst symmetry

in the sequel we establish the relationship between the irreducible and re-
ducible brst symmetries discussed in the above. in this respect we prove
that the physical observables of the irreducible theory coincide with those
of the reducible model. let f be an observable of the irreducible system.
consequently, it satises the equations

hf, (1)a

i

i

 0, hf, (2)a

i

i

 0,

10

(41)

where the weak equality holds on the surface dened by (2829). using (26)

 0, hf, (2)ai

hf, (1)ai
i

 0 lead to

the equations hf, (2)a

i

 0,

(42)

on the surface (2829). employing (26), by direct computation we nd that

hf, g(2)a

i

i

 0,

(43)

[f, a]  0,

(44)

on the same surface. on behalf of (44) it follows that the equations (42) are
equivalent with

hf, (1)ai

 0, hf, (2)ai

 0.

(45)

thus, any observable of the irreducible theory should verify the former equa-
tions in (41) and (4345) on the surface (2829).

next we show that the rst-class constraints (2829) are equivalent with

(1)a
i  0, g(2)a

i  0, a  0, (1)a  0, (2)a  0.

(46)

indeed, the constraints (1)a
enough to emphasize that the constraints

i  0, and (2)a  0 pertain to both sets, so it is

g(2)a

i  0, a  0, (1)a  0,

are equivalent to

(2)a
i  0, (1)a  0.

(47)

(48)

it is obvious that when (47) hold (48) hold, too. the converse results as
follows. substituting (26) in the concrete expression of (2)a

we arrive at

i

g(2)a

i = (cid:16)a
dj

i  (di)a

b

m b

c(cid:16)dj(cid:17)c

j  0.

d(cid:17) (2)d

(49)

from (26) and (49) we directly get that if (48) hold, then (47) also hold.
this proves the equivalence between the rst-class constraints (2829) and
(46).

by virtue of the above discussion, we have that any observable of the
irreducible theory, which we found that should verify the former equations in

11

(41) and (4345) on the surface (2829), will check these equations also on
the surface (46). as a consequence, the observables of the irreducible theory
and those of the theory based on the constraints (46) coincide. now, we
show that the observables of the system possessing the constraints (46) and
the observables corresponding to the original reducible theory also coincide.
we observe that the surface (46) can be obtained in a trivial manner from
(1)a
i

i

 0 by adding the canonical pairs (a, a), (cid:16)(1)

 0, g(2)a
a , (1)a(cid:17),
a , (2)a(cid:17) and requiring that their momenta vanish. thus, the observables
(cid:16)(2)
of the original model are unaected by the introduction of the new canonical
pairs. more precisely, the dierence between an observables f of the theory
based on the constraints (46) and one of the original theory f is of the type
f  f = aa + (1)
a (2)a. as any observables that dier through
a combination of rst-class constraints can be identied, it follows that the
observables of the original system and of the theory based on the constraints
(46) coincide. in consequence, we proved that the observables of the theory
with the constraints (46) coincide with those of the irreducible system, as
well as with those of the original model. this leads to the conclusion that
the observables of the irreducible and original reducible models coincide. in
turn, this matter has strong implications at the brst level.

a (1)a + (2)

as we noticed earlier, there exists a consistent hamiltonian brst sym-
metry satisfying the general grounds of homological perturbation theory
[15][18] associated with the irreducible system. comparing the standard
reducible hamiltonian brst symmetry corresponding to the freedman-
townsend model sr with that for the irreducible theory si from the point of
view of the basic equations underlying the brst formalism, we have that

r = 0, s2
s2

i = 0,

h 0 (sr) = h 0 (si) = {physical observables} .

(50)

(51)

the above relations enable us to substitute the hamiltonian brst quanti-
zation of the freedman-townsend model by that of the irreducible system.

2.4 irreducible path integral

based on the last conclusion, we pass to the hamiltonian brst quantiza-
tion of the irreducible rst-class theory, which is described by the rst-class
constraints (2829) and the rst-class hamiltonian (30). the ghost and

12

antighost spectra are respectively given by (37) and (34). at the same time,
we add the non-minimal sector

where the rst two sets of non-minimal elds are bosonic with ghost number
zero, while the last two sets are fermionic, with the s of ghost number minus
one and the p()s of ghost number one. the former variables in every set
are taken as elds, while the latter represent their momenta. under these
considerations, the non-minimal brst charge reads as

3 comparison with the standard reducible

approach

our irreducible context and those deriving in the standard reducible brst
approach. in the reducible approach the gauge-xed action can be brought

and o-shell nilpotent otherwise.

it is obvious that the ghosts for ghosts

(cid:16) ca, ca(cid:17) in the gauge-xed action (66) possess massless scalar eld propa-

gators, hence they output correct spin-statistics relations, in disagreement

15

with the requirement of not describing physical particles. in the meantime,
we cannot surpass this inconvenient by integrating over the ghosts for ghosts.

this is because the integration over (cid:16) ca, ca(cid:17) is cumbersome as the matrix of

their quadratic parts depends on the elds and the structure constants, such
that one cannot eliminate this term from the path integral. by contrast, the
ghosts for ghosts are absent within the gauge-xed action (62), so the above
disagreement is surpassed within the irreducible analysis. by performing the
identications

c a

(70)

among the variables involved with the gauge-xed actions derived within the
irreducible and reducible approaches, (62), respectively, (66), the dierence
between the two gauge-xed actions becomes

s  sk = z d4x(cid:18)(cid:16) ca(cid:17) (d)a

b cb +

1
8

f a

bc[ c ]a[ c c

]cb(cid:19) . (71)

we remark that s  sk is proportional with the ghosts for ghosts, cb, which
are some essential compounds of the reducible brst quantization. although
identied at the level of the gauge-xed actions, the elds c a and (1)a play
dierent roles within the two formalisms. more precisely, the presence of
(1)a within the irreducible model prevents the appearance of the reducibility,
while the c as represent an eect of the reducibility. in fact, the lagrangian
eect of introducing the elds (1)a resides in forbidding the existence of
the zero modes which are present within the original reducible theory. in
consequence, all the ingredients connected with the zero modes, like the
ghosts for ghosts or the non-minimal pyramid, are no longer involved. in this
light, we suggestively call the elds (1)a antimodes. the antimodes also
contribute to the dierence between the corresponding gauge-xed brst
symmetries. indeed, the absence of the ghosts for ghosts in our irreducible
context makes the gauge-xed brst symmetries (6465) o-shell nilpotent,
by contrast with the reducible situation (see (69)), and, moreover, removes
the three-ghost coupling term from our irreducible procedure. finally, we
mention that the number of antimodes is equal with the number of the pairs

(cid:16) ca, ca(cid:17) generated by the zero modes. obviously, neither the ghost for ghost

pairs nor the antimodes describe physical particles and are however governed
by correct spin-statistics relations, but, while the ghosts for ghosts cannot

16

be eliminated from the path integral by direct integration, the antimodes do
not produce this diculty due to the possibility of a safely integration over
them by making a gaussian average in (62).

4 conclusion

in this paper we show that the freedman-townsend model, which is a typical
example of on-shell rst-stage reducible hamiltonian system, can be consis-
tently approached along the irreducible hamiltonian brst line by replac-
ing the original reducible hamiltonian theory with an irreducible one. the
construction of the irreducible system is based on killing the initial redun-
dancy at the level of the koszul-tate complex. as the physical observables
associated with the irreducible and reducible versions coincide, the main
equations underlying the hamiltonian brst formalism make legitimate the
substitution of the reducible brst symmetry by the irreducible one. the
gauge-xed action of the irreducible model is derived within the hamiltonian
brst context by using an appropriate gauge-xing fermion. finally, we em-
phasize the comparison between our irreducible procedure and the standard
reducible brst treatment of the freedman-townsend model.
