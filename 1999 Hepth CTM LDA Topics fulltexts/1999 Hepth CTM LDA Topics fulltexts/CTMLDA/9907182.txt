(2) admits nonlocal parameterizations su(2) connection, 2 naturally associated hoofts abelian projections abelian vector potential contains magnetic monopoles described eld n. specifying let us rst analyze gauge transformation law new vari- ables. innitesimal gauge transformation su(2) connection reads = g1(a) = g1  . (1) infer c = n , w = g1n (a)n . (3) (4) substituting relations (2) solving n (two equations two in- dependent variables n), nd n = n(a). latter together (4) species inverse change variables. let n innitesimal gauge transformation n. (4) (3) follows c = (n n ) + g1n , w = w n + g1n (n n ) , (5) (6) used n n = 0. explicit form n found equation (n, a) = 0 (taken surface = 0) (n, a) obtained substitution (4) (w , c, n). emphasize n determined choice c w . let us introduce local orthonormal basis isotopic space n, nr n r = 0 nr n r = 1. also n nr = inr nr n 0, n2 basis determined modulo local transformations r: nr n = r = in. n xed, nr einr . (7) noted gauge freedom associated gauge group yang-mills theory new variables remain unchanged (7). local basis may exist globally eld nr may singularities. reason follows. spatial innity, connection must pure gauge. therefore n becomes constant |x| approaches innity, say, n0 = (0, 0, 1). eld n map three-sphere s3, compactied space, target two-sphere s2 isotopic space. homotopy group 3(s2) z trivial. integers z given hopf invariant. one attempts transform n n0 everywhere space rotation, rotation matrix ill-dened closed and, general, knotted contours. another type singularities associated homotopy group 2(s2) z eld n restricted s2 subspace s3. show new variables (1), yang-mills theory looks like abelian theory maxwell potential contains magnetic monopoles uxes associated nontriviality 2(s2) 3(s2), respectively. consider decomposition w = w nr + wn r .

(19) tensor product contains three independent components w perpendicular n. therefore one constraint components w: wh = 0. since functional integral one needs change variables, latter restriction w relaxed achieve goal if, example, set w = gw + g , (20) = (w, n) wh determined (19). eld (20) is, general, specied modulo factor may depend n. instance, condition (19) modied multiplying two terms tensor product coecients depending n. thanks gauge invariance yang-mills action, particular choice relevant partial duality always removed appropriate gauge transformation (6). quantum dynamics charged elds abelian theory (11) described antisymmetric eld w. jacobian change variables determinant euclidean metric ds2 = r dxda da ane space connections new variables (1) (20); da denotes functional dierential ane (eld) coordinate a. jacobian induces quantum corrections, associated curvilinearity new eld variables, classical action (11). dynamics charged eld w average yields h(w w) (w w)i m2 , (21) large distance limit, leading term gradient expansion eective action eld n would contain term m2 = m2(n)2. together tree level term proportional h 2 , forms, follows (11), action 8 faddeev model  describes knot-like massive solitons. solitonic excitations could good candidates glueballs. stability eective theory depends terms contained gradient expansion eective action. consider decomposition n = b b bb ) w = iwb + ib. dual (higgs) phase reported  may also exist abelian theory (11), provided average eld n property r. h = ig1(b nr + bn hbbi = 0 , hb bi 2 .
