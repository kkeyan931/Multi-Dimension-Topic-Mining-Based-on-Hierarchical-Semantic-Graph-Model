abstract

supersymmetry breaking via gaugino condensation is studied in vacua of heterotic mtheory

with vebranes. we show that supersymmetry is still broken by a global mechanism and that

the nonperturbative superpotential takes the standard form. when expressed in terms of low

energy elds, a modication arises due to a threshold correction in the gauge kinetic function

that depends on vebrane moduli. we also determine the form of the low energy matter eld

kahler potential. these results are used to discuss the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters,

in particular the question of universality.

1

introduction

starting with the seminal work by horava and witten [1, 2, 3, 4], considerable activity [5][47]
has been devoted to exploring various aspects of mtheory on the orbifold s1/z2 which represents
the strong coupling limit of e8  e8 heterotic string theory. most of the work dealing with com-
pactications of this theory based on calabiyau threefolds has used the standardembedding of

the spin connection into the gauge group as a starting point. although this leads to particularly

simple solutions of the weakly coupled heterotic string, this is not the case for its strongly coupled

counterpart. in fact, there does not seem to be any way, for calabiyau type compactications,

to set the antisymmetric tensor eld of 11dimensional supergravity to zero. hence, the standard

embedding does not appear to be particularly special in the strong coupling limit and one is led to

consider the general case of nonstandard embeddings. aspects of such nonstandard embeddings,

in vacua of heterotic mtheory not involving vebranes have been discussed in [32, 39, 40, 41].

it turns out that such nonstandard embedding vacua are, in fact, a small subclass of a much

larger class of vacua that, in addition, allows for the presence of vebranes. including vebranes

is quite natural from the mtheory viewpoint once general nonstandard embeddings are allowed

and is essential for a complete discussion of such vacua. these nonperturbative vacua, based

on calabiyau threefolds, general e8 gauge bundles and a number of vebranes, have been
constructed in two recent papers [41, 46]. the vebranes are oriented such that they stretch

across the 3 + 1dimensional uncompactied space and wrap on twocycles within the calabiyau

manifold.

these nonperturbative vacua have a number of new and perhaps surprising properties. most

notably, it has been explicitly shown [46] that threegeneration models with attractive lowenergy

gut groups exist for most calabiyau spaces in a certain specic class. this is facilitated by the

presence of the vebranes which introduce considerably more freedom in the anomaly cancellation

condition that consistent vacua need to satisfy. these results suggest that threegeneration models

exist for most calabiyau spaces once vebranes are allowed in the vacuum. another interesting

feature is the appearance of new sectors in the low energy theory that originate from the degrees

of freedom on the vebrane worldvolumes. in particular, these new sectors carry abelian or non

abelian gauge theories that enlarge the total low energy gauge group. at low energy, all these
sectors are coupled to one another and to the two conventional sectors that arise from e8  e8
only gravitationally. another interesting feature is that the two e8 sectors are modied due to the
presence of the vebranes. for example, the gauge kinetic functions depend on the moduli which

specify the positions of the vebranes in the orbifold direction. the appearance of these moduli

is a nonperturbative eect that cannot be seen in the weakly coupled limit of the heterotic string.

these properties make vacua of heterotic mtheory with vebranes a rich and interesting arena

for particle physics.

1

in this paper, we would like to investigate some of the physical properties of these new non

perturbative vacua. specically, we will analyze in detail how supersymmetry breaking via gaugino

condensation [54, 55] in the hidden sector works. for standard embedding vacua, gaugino con-

densation in heterotic mtheory was rst analyzed by horava [3] and subsequently by [17, 22].

supersymmetry breaking in ve dimensions was also studied in [48, 33, 45]. furthermore, we will

calculate the matter eld part of the d = 4 low energy eective action in its generic form. these

results will then be used to discuss soft supersymmetry breaking terms and, in particular, the

question of universality. recently, supersymmetry breaking and universality of the soft breaking

parameters in supergravity theories that originate from vacua with branes has also been discussed

in ref. [44].

it is important to be clear about the interpretation of the vacua from the low energy viewpoint.

in this paper, we will use a conservative interpretation in that we assume the observable sector

to arise from one of the e8 sectors. consequently, the vebrane sectors, as well as the other e8
sector, are hidden. in addition, we assume that supersymmetry breaking via gaugino condensation

occurs in the hidden e8 sector. these assumptions could be modied in two ways. first, it is
conceivable that, under certain conditions, one of the vebrane sectors could also be used as the

observable sector. although models along those lines have yet to be constructed in heterotic m

theory, there are recent type i examples [49, 50, 51] where semirealistic lowenergy theories arise

from threebrane worldvolume theories. in any case, the relation of our constructions to branebox

models [52, 53] suggests that chiral theories from the vebrane sectors might exist. as a second

modication, gaugino condensation could also occur in those hidden vebrane sectors that carry

nonabelian gauge groups. although these modications are worth investigating, in this paper

we stick to the simple interpretation explained above. in the end, we briey comment on gaugino

condensation in the vebrane sectors.

an important question we would like to address is how the presence of the vebranes aects

supersymmetry breaking via gaugino condensation. for the standardembedding case, horava

has shown that supersymmetry is broken by a mechanism that is global in the orbifold direction.

despite this new feature, the nonperturbative low energy potential induced by this condensate

turned out to be the same as in the weakly coupled case [5, 22]. the vebranes present in our non

perturbative vacua are stacked up along the orbifold direction; that is, precisely the direction in

which the global breaking mechanism occurs. it is, therefore, quite conceivable that the vebranes

can signicantly alter the picture of supersymmetry breaking via gaugino condensation.

to analyze this in detail, we will rst review the form of the vacua with vebranes, both from a

topological and an analytic viewpoint. in particular, we present the explicit form of those vacua as
an expansion, to linear order, in the strong coupling expansion parameter  = (/4)2/322/v2/3.

here  is the elevendimensional newton constant, v is the calabiyau volume and  is the orbifold

2

radius. subsequently, we incorporate gaugino condensation and analyze how supersymmetry is

broken on the level of the vacuum solution. in section 3, we compute the d = 4 superpotential

from gaugino condensation in terms of the condensate. while this was done in the 11dimensional

theory, in section 4, we present an alternative derivation in the vedimensional eective theory

of heterotic mtheory. to express the superpotential in terms of low energy elds, we need to

compute the matter eld part of the eective fourdimensional theory which is done in section 5.

finally, in section 6, we use these results to discuss soft supersymmetry breaking terms.

our results can be summarized as follows. on the level of the pure vacuum solution, su-

persymmetry breaking via gaugino condensation in the presence of vebranes still occurs via

horavas global mechanism. furthermore, the condensate superpotential as expressed in terms of

the condensate is unchanged with respect to the ordinary case. roughly speaking, these results

can be attributed to the fact that the gaugino condensate is associated with a dierent sector

of the calabiyau space than the curves on which the vebranes are wrapped. once the non

perturbative condensate potential is expressed in terms of the moduli elds, a new feature related

to the presence of vebranes occurs.

it turns out that the gauge kinetic functions in the e8
sectors have threshold corrections of order  which not only depend on the t moduli, but also

on the moduli that specify the positions of the vebranes in the orbifold direction [41]. hence,
the potential not only depends on the dilaton s and the t moduli t i, but also on the vebrane
position moduli z n. a similar correction of order  to the matter eld kahler metric depending on
s and z n is found as well. based on these results, we propose a parameterization of supersymmetry
breaking in terms of the auxiliary elds associated to s, t i and the vebrane moduli z n. using

this parameterization, we analyze the question of universality of soft parameters. universality can
be achieved at zeroth order in  by assuming supersymmetry breaking in the s or z n direction. as
usual, breaking in the t i directions is not generationindependent, even at zeroth order. from an

11dimensional point of view this happens because both the t moduli and the matter elds arise

as zero modes of the calabiyau space. when the order  corrections to the matter eld kahler

metric are taken into account no specic supersymmetry breaking pattern leads to universality.

generally, not even a pure stype breaking scenario [60] will work. the 11dimensional reason

for this is an orbifold dependence of the background on which the reduction to four dimensions is

performed. this dependence arises from the sources provided by the elds on the orbifold planes

and the vebranes and, as such, is a general phenomenon for vacua containing branes. we ob-

serve that this diculty can be overcome by choosing a specic type of calabiyau space with
h1,1 = 1. in this case, universality to order  is guaranteed independently of the breaking pattern.

soft breaking parameters are then computed for this particular case. these parameters can be of

the order m3/2 or m3/2 with a characteristic signature that is directly correlated to the pattern of
supersymmetry breaking.

3

2 the elevendimensional background

in this section, we would like to review the vacua of heterotic mtheory with nonstandard em-

bedding and vebranes constructed in ref. [41, 46].

in addition, we would like to incorporate

gaugino condensates on the orbifold planes and show, on the level of the vacuum solution, how

supersymmetry is broken by those condensates. most importantly, we would like to understand the

role of the vebranes in this context. none of the ingredients needed for this is essentially new.

nevertheless we nd it useful to present a coherent argument and to set the stage for what is going

to follow.

let us rst explain the basic structure of the nonperturbative vacua and their topological

properties following ref. [46]. to lowest order, we consider a spacetime

m11 = m4  s1/z2  x

(2.1)

where x is a calabiyau threefold and m4 is fourdimensional minkowski space. furthermore,
one needs to specify two semistable gauge bundles vi, i = 1, 2 on x with gauge groups gi  e8. as
discussed, we also allow for the presence of n vebranes in the vacuum. these vebranes should

stretch across m4 (to preserve 3 + 1dimensional poincare invariance) and wrap on holomorphic
curves c (n)  x where n = 1, . . . , n (to preserve n = 1 supersymmetry in four dimensions). note
that, given this orientation, the vebranes are located at specic points in the orbifold direction
which we denote by x11 = x1, . . . , xn , where 0  x1    xn  . as we will discuss later on,
inclusion of vebranes is important as it allows for the construction of physically interesting vacua

that would otherwise be forbidden. heuristically, this can be understood from the cohomology

constraint

c2(v1) + c2(v2) + [w ] = c2(t x)

(2.2)

that has to be imposed on such vacua in order to be anomaly free. here [w ] is the cohomology

class associated with the vebranes and c2(vi) and c2(t x) are the second chern classes of the
gauge bundles vi and the tangent bundle t x respectively. in fact, for a given calabiyau space
and given vector bundles one can always choose a class [w ] such that eq. (2.2) is satised. as was

shown in ref. [46], there is an additional physical constraint on [w ], namely that it constitutes an

eective class. essentially, this means that [w ] corresponds to holomorphic curves in x; that is, the
n=1 c (n) where the c (n) are linear combinations
of holomorphic curves with nonnegative integer coecients. this has to be contrasted to the

associated vebrane must be of the form w =pn

situation without vebranes where simply [w ] = 0.

in ref. [46], these statements have been made much more precise by constructing su (n) gauge

bundles over elliptically bered calabiyau spaces. this allows one to explicitly compute the

chernclasses c2(t x) and c2(vi) and hence, from eq. (2.2), the class [w ] of the vebrane curve.

4

it was shown that the eectiveness constraint can be satised and further physical requirements can

be imposed. in particular, a threegeneration constraint can be accommodated without problems

along with, for example, an su (5) gauge bundle that leads to a low energy su (5) grand unication

group. it was also demonstrated, for a specic example, how to determine the moduli space of curves

w associated with the class [w ]. this moduli space turns out to be a complicated multibranched

object that carries information about the additional vebranes sectors. in particular, sticking to
a specic branch, it allows one to read o the number of vebranes, n , and the classes [c (n)] of
their associated curves. with this information one can dene the instanton numbers (0)

 corresponding to four preserved supercharges. we will use 11dimensional indices i, j, k, =
0, . . . , 9, 11, fourdimensional indices , , , = 0, . . . 3 and calabiyau indices a, b, c, =
4, . . . , 9. holomorphic and antiholomorphic indices on the calabiyau space are denoted by
a, b, c, . . . and a, b, c, . . . . the form of the vacuum has been computed using an expansion, to

this (1, 1)form can be expanded in terms of harmonics of the calabiyau laplacian. for the

purpose of computing low energy eective actions, it is sucient to keep the massless terms in this

expansion; that is, the terms proportional to the harmonic (1, 1)forms of the calabiyau space.

let us now analyze the properties of these vacua in the presence of gaugino condensates. we

recall that, following horava [3], the proper way to avoid singularities in the presence of condensates

is to redene the antisymmetric tensor eld according to

g i j k l = g i j k l
g i j k11 = g i j k11 

with the gaugino bilinears

the sources j (0) and j (n +1) on the orbifold planes are as usual given by

the sources j (n), n = 1, . . . , n arise due to the presence of the vebranes. finally, the sources
j (,i) originate from the gaugino condensates and are dened as

j (,i) = d(,i) .

7

(2.20)

for generality, we have considered condensates on both orbifold planes. later on we will specialize

to the physical case of one condensate only. specializing to the eld conguration of the above
vacua all sources j (n), where n = 0, . . . , n + 1, constitute (2, 2)forms on the calabiyau space.
then the charges (n)

that we have dened earlier can be written as

i =zc4i
where {c4i} is a basis of h4(x) dual to the basis {c i

j (n) .

2} of h2(x) introduced above.

(2.21)

of course, the nonstandard embedding vacua with vebranes, eq. (2.6)(2.10), that we have

constructed constitute a solution of the eqs. (2.15)(2.18) in the absence of condensates, as they

should. as usual, we will consider condensates which, as part of the vacuum, are covariantly

constant and closed. let us now discuss our vacua in the presence of such condensates. the only
change in the equations (with the replacement of g by g understood) is then the appearance of the
condensate in the killing spinor equation (2.16). hence, if we set g equal to the eld g(1) of our
solutions and use the corresponding killing spinor  and metric gij , we can satisfy all equations
except 11 = 0. following ref. [3], one can try and modify the spinor  to  +  so as to also
satisfy this nal equation. one nds from eq. (2.16)

11() = 

1

192 (cid:16) 

4(cid:17)2/3h(,1)(x11) + (,2)(x11  )i i j k

i j k 0 .



(2.22)

i j k  i j k(cy)(x11), where (x11) is the
locally, this equation is solved by  proportional to (,i)
step functions which is +1 for positive x11 and 1 otherwise. such a modication also leaves
the 10dimensional part of the killing spinor equation,  i = 0, intact since the condensates are
covariantly constant. matching both functions in eq. (2.22), however, is impossible unless

((,1) + (,2)) i j k

i j k0 = 0 .

(2.23)

generally, this condition is violated and this is particularly so in the physical situation of a

condensate on one orbifold plane only. clearly, the obstruction of solving eq. (2.23) is global

in nature and is, of course, just the global supersymmetry breaking mechanism discovered by

horava [3]. what we have shown here is that this global mechanism continues to work even for

the more general vacua with nonstandard embedding and vebranes. this is not surprising since

the essential part of the argument does not depend on the specic form of the linearized solution

considered, but merely on the fact that the condensates are covariantly constant and closed. let
us summarize the essential steps of the argument. we have seen that the vebrane sources j (n)
enter the problem only via the bianchi identity (2.18). the condensate sources j (,i) in this bianchi
identity vanish since the condensate is closed. therefore, the redened antisymmetric tensor eld g
is unchanged from the previous g. as a consequence, the only obstruction to satisfying the killing

spinor equations comes from the explicit condensate terms in eq. (2.16). hence, the equation (2.22)

8

for the correction to the killing spinor does not contain the antisymmetric tensor eld g, the only
object that carries information about the vebranes. the nature of the breaking is, therefore,

independent on the presence of vebranes. although not involving anything essentially new,

we found it worth presenting the above argument in some detail since it contradicts the naive

expectation.

intuitively, one might expect that a supersymmetry breaking mechanism global in

the orbifold is modied by vebranes stacked along this direction. what we have seen is that this

does not happen, at least for the pure background case that we have discussed so far.

3 the gaugino condensate potential

in the previous section, we have shown that even for nonstandard embedding and in the presence

of vebranes supersymmetry breaking due to gaugino condensates on the orbifold planes continues

to work via horavas global mechanism. now we would like to proceed further and compute the low

energy superpotential associated with this breaking. again, an important question to be claried

is how the vebranes enter the fourdimensional low energy theory. in particular, since the ve

branes are stacked between what will become the hidden and the observable sector at low energy,

one might expect a signicant change of the nonperturbative potential.

to address this problem, let us rst recall how the gaugino condensate superpotential arises in
heterotic mtheory [22]. although the condensate sources j (,i) vanish for the background solution,

this is no longer true once the moduli in this solution are promoted to fourdimensional elds. more

specically, we use the standard expression [55]

(,i)
abc = tr (i)abc(i) = (i)abc

(3.1)

for the condensate, where abc is the covariantly constant (3, 0)form of the calabiyau space. in
this expression, the condensation scales (i) are functions of the lowenergy moduli elds. hence,

we have the nonvanishing components

j (,i)
abc = (i)abc

(3.2)

of the gaugino sources. in the bianchi identity (2.18), these sources appear with functions and

they have to be carefully integrated out when deriving the fourdimensional eective action. as

was rst observed in ref. [20, 24], this is a general phenomenon for theories with dynamical elds

on boundaries. not only have boundary sources induced by the background elds to be taken into

account (as we did when we derived the above vacuum solutions) but, in addition, all sources that

appear once the zero modes are promoted to elds in the low energy theory. doing this is essential

in order to arrive at the correct low energy theory and, in particular, to obtain all terms required

by supersymmetry. applied to the present situation, it means that the antisymmetric tensor eld

(3.3)

out the condensate sources (3.2) in the bianchi identity (2.18). explicitly one has

using the ux quantization rule of heterotic mtheory derived in ref. [22], one can show that the
constant  in this expression must vanish. finally, g(mod) accounts for all other sources involving

derivatives of low energy elds as discussed above. it is clear that the gaugino condensate potential
arises by inserting g into the perfect square (2.14). then, the standard result for the low energy
potential, of course, arises from g()
abc11g()abc11. one could, however, expect corrections to this
result from mixing terms between g() and other parts of (3.3), in particular those that originate

from the presence of the vebranes or contain vebrane zero modes. to discuss this in more
detail, let us refer to a part of g with n holomorphic, m antiholomorphic and k 11 indices (where
k = 0, 1) as a (n, m, k) component. in this terminology, the standard gaugino potential arises from
(3, 0, 1) and (0, 3, 1) components. let us rst consider the background eld g(1). since the form of
g(1) is intimately related to the presence of the vebranes, a mixing term g(1)g() could lead to a
correction of the potential induced by vebranes. however, eq. (2.7) shows that that g(1) consists

of (2, 2, 0), (2,1,1) and (1,2,1) components only and, hence, such a mixing term is impossible. a part
of g(mod) is related to sources from low energy elds on the orbifold planes. explicit expressions

for the various components from such sources have been given in ref. [20]. there exists, in fact, one

(3, 0, 1) component proportional to abcw , where w is the matter eld superpotential. this leads
to an expected cross term between the condensate potential and the matter eld superpotential.

in fact, such a term always has to be present and is in no way related to the presence of ve
branes. there is another part of g(mod) due to sources from low energy elds that originate from

the vebrane worldvolume. the orientation of the vebranes guarantees, however, that this part
of g(mod) is of the type (2, 2, 0) and, hence, cannot mix with g(). in conclusion, we nd that the

gaugino condensate potential does not receive corrections due to nonstandard embedding or the
presence of vebranes. we simply have wgaugino  (1) + (2).
f (2)(cid:21)

let us now specialize to the physical case (1) = 0 and (2) 6= 0. following [55], we write

exp(cid:20)

gutv

(2) 

6

bgut

(3.6)

where

gut =

(42)2/3

2v

.

10

(3.7)

here b and f (2) are the function coecient and the gauge kinetic function for the gauge group

on the second orbifold plane. hence the superpotential for a single condensate is given by

wgaugino = h exp(cid:20)

6

bgut

f (2)(cid:21)

(3.8)

where h is a constant of order /1/2v. for more than one condensate [56], we get a sum of terms

of the above type with dierent coecients b, as usual.

to summarize, let us briey recapitulate why vebranes did not eect the potential. once the

zero modes are promoted to low energy elds, the bianchi identity (2.18) contains, in addition to

the vebrane sources, condensate sources as well as other sources related to the zero modes on the
orbifold planes and on the vebrane worldvolumes. this leads to a complicated structure of g as
indicated by eq. (3.3). the conventional part of the gaugino condensate potential results from g2.
hence, one could expect cross terms between the gaugino part and parts related to the presence

of vebranes. as we have seen, those cross terms do not exist because the gaugino part and the

vebrane part are associated to dierent index structures in the calabiyau space. as a result,

the potential is unmodied.

4 the vedimensional viewpoint

the above line of reasoning can be equivalently presented purely in the vedimensional eective

action of heterotic mtheory. logically, this does not, of course, provide any new information over

what we have done in 11 dimensions. however, since the vedimensional eective action is of

interest in its own right, we nd it useful to reformulate our argument from a vedimensional

viewpoint.

to do so, we need to recall some facts about the vedimensional eective action of heterotic
mtheory [30, 36, 41]. the bulk part of this theory represents a gauged n = 1 supergravity theory
coupled to h1,1  1 vector multiplets and h2,1 + 1 hypermultiplets. fivedimensional spacetime
has the structure m5 = s1/z2  m4 where m4 is a smooth four manifold.

this bulk supergravity is then coupled to two fourdimensional n = 1 theories on the orbifold
x points that originate from the two e8 sectors of the 11dimensional theory and, in addition, to n
threebrane worldvolume theories with n = 1 supersymmetry that originate from the vebranes
in the vacuum. for the purpose of this section, we can concentrate on the structure of the bulk

theory. some details about the spectrum on the fourdimensional theories will be given in the next

section.

to be specic, we introduce the calabiyau (1, 1) moduli ai
5 and associated (1, 1) vector elds
ai
, where i, j, k, = 1, . . . , h1,1. we use indices , ,  = 0, . . . , 3, 11 for the vedimensional

11

spacetime. in the bulk, the eld strengths of these vector elds are given by

the volume modulus of the calabiyau space can be expressed in terms of the (1, 1) moduli as

they represent only h1,1  1 independent degrees of freedom. to make this more explicit, we

introduce independent scalars x, where x = 1, . . . , h1,1  1 such that bi

 is the graviphoton and a

here g is the d = 5 metric, 2
 is the gravitino. fermions in ve
dimensions are described by symplectic spinors and, in this section, we use indices a, b, c, = 1, 2
for the su (2) r symmetry. since the gravity multiplet contains one vector eld one remains with
h1,1  1 vector multiplets. their structure is given by

(x, bx

, xa)

5iai

(4.6)

where bx

5i projects onto the x subspace and xa are the gauginos. note that so far we have not

used the volume modulus v5. it becomes part of the universal hypermultiplet

(v5, , , ,  a) .

(4.7)

here  is a real scalar and  a are the hypermultiplet fermions. the bulk eld strength of the

complex scalar eld  is denoted by

x =  .

(4.8)

this eld strength will be of some importance in the following. we do not need to explicitly
introduce the remaining h2,1 hypermultiplets.

the gauging of the theory is with respect to the isometry    + const of the universal
hypermultiplet coset space and the associated gauge boson is a certain linear combination iai



12

of the vectors elds, where i are charges. the bulk action for those elds has been derived
in ref. [30, 36] for the case of the standard embedding. it has been shown [41] that this action

remains valid even in the presence of vebranes once the charges i are chosen appropriately.
more specically, for the interval zn  |z|  zn+1 between any two neighboring vebranes, where
n = 0, . . . , n , one should replace the charges i by

i  (n)

with (n)

as introduced in eq. (2.3). strictly speaking, for each interval one has, therefore, a dierent

i

now, we need to set up the essential parts of the d = 5 theory incorporating a gaugino

condensate. as in 11 dimensions, we start with a eld redenition to avoid singularities. since

the condensate originates from the (3, 0) part of the calabiyau space, as in eq. (3.1), we need to

redene the corresponding zero mode. this zero mode is precisely the complex scalar eld  with

eld strength x in the universal hypermultiplet. in analogy with eq. (2.12), we dene

x = x

(4.10)

analog in ve dimensions of the perfect square (2.14) reads

s()
5 =

(4.12)

the bianchi identity for x has been given in ref. [36]. inserting the denition (4.11) we obtain

 + (1))(x11) + (4j (2)

 + (2))(x11  )i

(4.13)

where j (i)
 is proportional to w (i), the derivative of the matter eld superpotential on the ith
orbifold plane. it is important to note that neither the bianchi identity (4.13) nor the relevant
part of the equation of motion for x (to be derived from (4.12)) have sources located on the
threebranes that originate from the vebranes. the reason for this was already explained from

the 11dimensional perspective. due to the orientation of the vebranes, they cannot contribute

to the (3, 0) part of the calabiyau space. in the vedimensional theory, this fact is manifest in

the structure of the above equations.

finally, we need the vedimensional bulk supersymmetry transformations. for the standard

embedding, they have been derived in ref. [30, 36]. to adapt these transformations to our sit-

uation, they should be modied in two ways. first, one should apply the replacement (4.9) as

13

discussed. secondly, one should incorporate the gaugino condensate and the denition (4.11), as

in the analogous 11dimensional equations (2.15) and (2.16). this leads to

(4.18)

this concludes our review of the vedimensional eective action. let us now discuss the vacuum

solution of this theory in the absence of a condensate. this solution is a bps multidomain wall

with n + 2 worldvolumes that constitutes the appropriate background for a reduction to four

dimensions. it is a straightforward generalization of the solution found in ref. [30, 36] and it can be

most easily obtained, in its linearized version, by just rewriting the 11dimensional solution (2.6)
(2.10) in terms of vedimensional elds. moreover, it satises the killing spinor equations a
 = 0,
xa = 0 and  a = 0 for a certain killing spinor a as long as the condensate vanishes. once the
condensate is switched on, the only supersymmetry transformation that changes is the one for a
11.
as in 11 dimensions, we can try to modify the spinor a to a + a so as to compensate for this

change. this leads to

11(1) = (s11)1

2 2 .

(4.19)

and the equation for 2 obtained by conjugation. again, this equation has a local solution every-

where. the existence of a global solution, however, requires

(1) + (2) = 0

14

(4.20)

which is the vedimensional analog of eq. (2.23). hence, we have rediscovered the global breaking

mechanism from a vedimensional viewpoint.

now, we promote the moduli of the multidomain wall solution to fourdimensional elds.
then, the sources in the bianchi identity (4.13) become nonvanishing. the solution for x then
takes the form

x = x (w )

 + x ()


(4.21)

accounts for the sources j (i)

 related to the superpotentials on the orbifold planes and

where x (w )
x ()




originates from the condensate sources. the solution for x ()


is given by

(4.22)

(4.23)

then, the gaugino condensate potential arises from inserting x ()
into the perfect square (4.12).
11
we nd wgaugino  (1) + (2) as before. hence, for the physical case (1) = 0 and (2) 6= 0,
we obtain the previous result (3.8) for the superpotential in terms of the gauge kinetic function.

once more we see that the potential is unchanged, at this level, by the threebranes that originate

from the vebranes. from the vedimensional viewpoint, the reason is that these threebranes
decouple from the crucial bianchi identity (4.13) and the equation of motion for x, as we have
stated earlier.

5 the fourdimensional eective action

to proceed further, we need some information about the fourdimensional n = 1 eective action
associated with our vacua. in particular, we need to know the gauge kinetic function that enters the

gaugino condensate potential (3.8). the main goal of this section is, therefore, to derive the matter

eld part of the low energy action. to put these results into the correct context we will, however,

start by explaining the general structure of the low energy actions derived from our vacua [41].

the eld content of the action splits into n + 2 sectors coupled to one another only gravi-

tationally. two of those sectors arise from the e8 gauge multiplets on the orbifold planes while
the other n originate from the degrees of freedom on the vebrane worldvolume theories. all of
these sectors have n = 1 supersymmetry. let us rst explain the two conventional e8 sectors.
we have considered internal gauge bundles vi, i = 1, 2 with gauge groups gi in these two sectors.
the surviving low energy gauge groups hi are the commutants of gi in e8. in general, from each
boundary i, we have gauge matter elds in those representations r of hi that appear in the de-

composition 248e8 ps,r(s, r) of the adjoint of e8 under gi  hi. the number of families, for

15

a certain representation r, is given by the dimension of h 1(x, vis) where vis is the vector bundle
vi in the representation s. we stress again that, for the class of vacua we are considering here, we
expect many examples where the chiral asymmetry takes the physical value three.

from the vebranes, we get additional gauge groups h(n), n = 1, . . . n . generically, these
groups are given by h(n) = u (1)gn where gn is the genus of the cycle c (n)  x on which the nth
vebrane wraps. they can, however, enhance to nonabelian groups, typically unitary groups,
when vebranes overlap or a curve c (n) degenerates. in any case, the low energy gauge group is
enlarged to h = h1  h2  h(1)    h(n ).

various sets of moduli arise in the low energy theory. first of all, we have the kahler and

complex structure moduli of the calabiyau space along with their superpartners. from the gauge

bundles vi we get two sets of bundle moduli. furthermore, we have moduli describing the position
of the vebranes in the orbifold direction as well as moduli that parameterize the moduli space of

the vebrane curve within the calabiyau space.

it is quite possible that reasonable observable sectors could arise from the vebrane world-

volume, although explicit models along these lines have not yet been explored. in this paper, we

adopt the more conservative viewpoint that one of the e8 sectors, say the one on the rst orbifold
plane, constitutes the observable sector while all other sectors are hidden. we have shown [46] that

low energy grand unication groups (for example h1 = su (5)) with three generations can easily
be obtained in this sector due to the freedom introduced by the presence of vebranes. we would

then like to study the low energy (matter eld) action in this sector and supersymmetry breaking

induced by the other e8 sector. it is likely that the hidden sectors from vebranes can contribute
to supersymmetry breaking via gaugino condensation as well under certain circumstances. we

postpone the investigation of this question to a future publication [57].

let us now be more specic about the ingredients we need to discuss the eective theory. for the

observable gauge matter, we focus on a specic irreducible representation r of the gauge group h1.
suppose that r appears as the product s  r in the decomposition of 248e8 under g1  h1. then
there will be dim(h 1(x, v1s )) families of this type which we denote by c ip(r). here i, j, k, =
1, . . . , dim(h 1(x, v1s )) is the family index and p, q, = 1, . . . , dim(r) the representation index
i (r)} of h 1(x, v1s ), where x, y, = 1, . . . , dim(s)
of r. we also need to introduce a basis {ux
is the representation index of s, and generators txp(r) corresponding to the (r, s)part in the
decomposition of 248e8. the complex conjugate of these generators is denoted by t xp(r) and
the normalization is chosen such that tr(txp(r)t yq(r)) = y
p. as an example, consider a gauge
bundle v1 with gauge group g1 = su (4). then we have a low energy theory with the grand
unication group h1 = so(10). the corresponding decomposition of the adjoint of e8 under

xq

16

su (4)  so(10) reads

248 = (15, 1)  (1, 45)  (6, 10)  (4, 16)  (4, 16) .

(5.1)

the relevant representations are then (s, r) = (4, 16) for the families, (s, r) = (4, 16) for the

antifamilies and (s, r) = (6, 10) for the higgs elds.

also, we need to introduce explicitly some of the moduli. most notably, there are the averaged

calabiyau volume v and the radius r of the orbifold in units of v and , respectively. the
(1, 1)moduli ai of the calabiyau space, where i, j, k, = 1, . . . , h1,1, are dened as  = aii.
here ab = ig(cy)
is the kahler form. as a function of the (1, 1)moduli, the volume is given by
v = v (a) = k(a)/6 with the kahler potential k(a) = dijkaiajak and the calabiyau intersection
numbers dijk. we also note that the metric (2.9) can be expressed as

ab

gij(a) = 

1
2

ij lnk(a) .

(5.2)

an important role will be played by the moduli zn  [0, 1], where n = 1, . . . n , that specify the
position of the vebranes in the orbifold direction.

introducing the conventional fourdimensional chiral elds s, t i as well as the chiral elds z n,

we have

re(s) = v ,

re(t i) = rai ,

re(z n) = zn .

(5.3)

(5.4)

another relevant quantity is the metric
1

g(r)

ij (a) =

vv zxqg(cy)g(cy)abuiax(r)ux

jb(r)

on the moduli space h 1(x, v1s ). in general, this metric is a function of the kahler moduli ai, as
we have indicated, as well as a function of the complex structure and bundle moduli. finally, we

need the yukawacouplings

ijk

=zx

  ux

i (r1)  uy

j (r2)  uz

k(r3)f (r1r2r3)

(5.5)

where f (r1r2r3)
projects onto the singlet in r1  r2  r3 (if any). as an example, for the above
so(10) case, the relevant products are of course 10 16 16 and 10 16 16. as is well known,
these yukawacouplings are quasitopological, depending on the complex structure moduli and the
dolbeault cohomology classes of the ux

i (r) only.

for the explicit computation, it is useful to write the metric of our vacuum solution in terms of

the moduli introduced above. one nds from eq. (2.6)(2.8)

where the bi are the parameters encoding the deformation of the calabiyau space as dened in
eq. (2.10) and g(4)
 is the fourdimensional einsteinframe metric. the part of the e8 gauge eld
strength that gives rise to the matter elds can be written as

fb = 2gut xr

one can compute the relevant lowenergy quantities. in the following, we suppress the representa-

can think of the indices i, j, k . . . as running over the various relevant representations as well as
over the families. we nd for the gauge kinetic function f (1) of the observable group h (1) and the

(5.20)

we remark that the kahler potential for hidden matter can easily be obtained from eq. (5.13) by
the replacement zn  1  zn.

we can now insert the result (5.11) for the hidden sector gauge kinetic function into eq. (3.8).

this leads to the explicit gaugino condensate potential

(5.21)

for a single condensate. although the presence of vebranes did thus far not eect the condensate

potential, we see that this nal step introduces a vebrane dependent modication resulting from

the threshold correction to the gauge kinetic function. as a result, the potential (5.21) not only
depends on the dilaton s and the t moduli, but also on the vebrane position moduli z n.

6 phenomenological issues

in this section we discuss some phenomenological issues related to supersymmetry breaking and

the eective fourdimensional matter eld action that we have computed. our emphasis will be on

the consequences for soft supersymmetry breaking terms.

we will not attempt to construct explicit gaugino condensate models based on the superpoten-

tial (5.21), since that would lead us into complicated model building. instead, we will parameterize

supersymmetry breaking in terms of the auxiliary elds of the moduli. usually, this is done using

the auxiliary elds associated to the dilaton and the t moduli [60, 61]. the presence of the ve
brane position moduli z n in the gaugino condensate superpotential, however, suggests that one

should, in general, also allow their auxiliary components to contribute to supersymmetry break-

ing. hence, we will analyze supersymmetry breaking that can be parameterized by auxiliary elds
(f s, f i, f n) corresponding to the moduli (s, t i, z n), respectively.

the starting point is the kahler potential

k = 2

p kmod + zij c i c j

(6.1)

where kmod is the kahler potential of the moduli depending on s, t i, z n and the other moduli
and zij was given in eq. (5.13). the fourdimensional newton constant p is dened in terms
of 11dimensional quantities as 2
p = 2/2v. one also needs the gauge kinetic function f (1),
eq. (5.10) and the yukawa couplings yijk in the superpotential (5.20). after integrating out the
moduli, the eective yukawa coupling will be

yijk = ekmod/2 yijk .

(6.2)

it will be useful for our discussion to explicitly list the general expressions for the soft masses [58,

59, 60]. one has

here m3/2 is the gravitino mass, m1/2 is the gaugino mass, m2
aijk are the trilinear soft couplings. indices a, b, c, . . . run over all moduli elds.

i j are the scalar soft masses and

there are two aspects of our scenario that make an analysis of soft terms interesting; that is,

the possibility of supersymmetry breaking in the direction of the vebrane position moduli and

the presence of the order  correction to the eective action. both aspects might inuence the

magnitude of the soft terms compared to perturbative heterotic string, as we will discuss later on

in more detail. for standardembedding vacua of heterotic mtheory and a simple model with one

family, soft terms in the presence of  corrections have been already studied [15, 21, 22].

before we come to that, we would like to address the problem of universality of soft breaking

parameters. in fact, universality might provide a stronger phenomenological constraint than just

the overall size of soft terms. we remark that for a perfectly universal model (at the unication
scale) we should have m2
i j  zi j and aijk  yijk. the obstruction to universality results from
the last term in the expressions for m2
i j and aijk in eq. (6.5) and (6.6). of course, there is nothing
wrong with choosing the moduli so as to make these last terms universal as well (something one

expects to be able to do for a suciently large number of moduli). however, given the accuracy

at which universality holds, this requires a signicant ne tuning in moduli space. therefore, it

is much more desirable to have a reason for universality to occur in a given model. the usual

assumption along these lines is that supersymmetry is broken in the direction of moduli that are

avorblind. to discuss this possibility, let us neglect the  corrections to our eective action for

the moment and concentrate on the lowest order part. clearly, the lowest order part of the matter
eld kahler potential is independent on s and z n. therefore, if supersymmetry breaking occurs

in the dilaton direction the soft terms will be universal to that order [60]. the same is true if
some of the auxiliary elds f n associated to the vebrane positions are nonvanishing. this last

option represents a new breaking pattern that is directly related to the presence of vebranes in

20

our vacua. what is the reason for this structure from an 11dimensional viewpoint? both, the

t moduli and the matter elds arise as zero modes associated to the shape of the calabiyau
space. hence supersymmetry breaking in the t i directions is generally not avorblind. on the
other hand, the moduli z n arise as zeromodes of the vebrane worldvolume theories and, hence,

do not distinguish between the generations to zeroth order.

let us now discuss the eect of the  corrections, which we have neglected so far. of course, if 

is very small these terms need not concern us much. however, it is well known that  is of order one

at the physical point where coupling unication can be realized [5]. hence, those terms are quite

possibly subject to the universality constraint as well. unfortunately, from eq. (5.13) we see that
the  corrections to the kahler metric depend on s as well as on z n. in addition, the zero and rst

order contributions to zij are generically not proportional to each other. this implies that, unlike
for the lowest order case, there is no specic pattern of supersymmetry breaking that will lead to
universality, in general. note, that also the f s scenario will not work in this case. let us again

discuss this from an 11dimensional point of view. to zeroth order, moduli were avorsensitive or

avorblind depending on whether or not they arise as zero modes of the calabiyau space. this

does not remain true once the  corrections are taken into account. these corrections correspond

to an orbifold dependence of the 11dimensional background that arises from the sources on the

orbifold planes and the vebranes. this dependence encodes interaction across the orbifold

and leads, for example, to a coupling of the vebrane moduli to the matter elds. this coupling

appears despite the fact that the matter elds and the vebrane moduli are separated in the

orbifold direction. we remark that one expects such corrections quite generally in vacua that

contain branes although they need not to be necessarily large.

one way out of the universality problem is to nd a way to make the zeroth and rst order

part of zij proportional. there is, indeed, a simple way to do that, namely to choose a calabi
yau space with one kahler modulus only (h1,1 = 1). such calabiyau spaces exist, the quintic
hypersurface in cp 4 being the simplest example. moreover, as our previous experience shows [46],

with the freedom introduced by allowing nonstandard embedding and vebranes the construction

of threegeneration models on such calabiyau spaces might be considerably easier than for the

restrictive standardembedding. let us, therefore, analyze this case in more detail. since we have

only one t modulus, the metric kbij in eq. (5.17) can be written as

kbij =

3

(t + t )2 hij

with some t independent metric hij . we then nd for the matter eld kahler metric

zij =(cid:20)

the relevant part of the moduli kahler potential then reads

kmod =  ln(s + s)  3 ln(t + t ) + k5

(6.11)

(6.12)

where k5 is the kahler potential for the vebrane moduli z n. now s, t as well as the vebrane
moduli z n enter the matter kahler potential in a generationindependent way and we expect
universal soft masses as long as supersymmetry is broken in the sector (f s, f t , f n) (which was

our original assumption). more specically we get

in these equations,  contains the vebrane moduli z n and is given by eq. (6.11). we also used
an index notation for derivatives with respect to z n, for example n = /z n. we see that, by
means of a simple topological assumption and supersymmetry breaking in the (f s, f t , f n) sector,

we have achieved universality to linear order in  (that is, to the order we can calculate). depending

on the specic breaking pattern, the size of the various soft terms is either of order m3/2 or of order
m3/2. given that  still has to be somewhat smaller than one in order to stay within the limits of
our approximations, the second option implies a certain suppression. let us discuss some examples.
consider supersymmetry breaking in the f t direction. then the gaugino mass is of order m3/2,
an observation that was rst made in ref. [15]. also, the trilinear soft terms are of that order while

the scalar soft masses still vanish [21, 22]. as an alternative possibility, consider supersymmetry
breaking in the directions f n of the vebrane moduli. the gaugino masses then remain at the

order m3/2 while trilinear soft terms and scalar masses are now of order m3/2. in general, we see
that the structure of our models provides a direct correlation between the magnitude of soft masses

and the pattern of supersymmetry breaking.

we would like to conclude with some outlook on supersymmetry breaking via gaugino conden-

sation in the type of models considered in this paper. here, we have only analyzed the simplest case

of gaugino condensation in the e8 sectors. as we have seen, one expects additional hidden sectors in
the eective theory that originate from the degrees of freedom on the vebrane worldvolumes. in

particular, under certain circumstances [46], these hidden sectors have nonabelian gauge groups.

hence, gaugino condensation might also occur in these sectors. due to the origin of these new

gauge groups, their gauge kinetic functions might be quite dierent from the conventional ones

in the e8 sectors. this might shed new light on the generic problems of gaugino condensation [62],
such as the stabilization of the dilaton at large eld values. we will address these issues in a future

publication [57].
