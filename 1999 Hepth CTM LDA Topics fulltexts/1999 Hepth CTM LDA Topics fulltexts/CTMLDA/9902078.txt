2 = x 11. 11d supermembrane action sm without 3-form gauge eld coupling presented follows; sm = tsm z d1dx 11q| det gsm ab |, (2.1) gsm ab induced metric world-volume supermembrane(sm), factor tsm denotes membrane tension; sm = 1/(2)2l3 sgs. letters a, b denote world-volume coordinates (, 1, x 11). induced met- described using super-space coordinates supermembrane z = ric gsm ab (x m, x 11, ) (m = 0, 1, , 9 = 1, , 32) 11d supergravity background metric g n ; p = 1/(2)2l3 ab = az bz n g n . gsm (2.2) kk massive modes -1 world sheet eliminated dimensional reduction x 11, leaving kk massless zero mode world sheet. procedure yielded putting following condition; x 11 ( fields ) = 0. (2.3) condition (2.3) corresponds also setting elds independent x 11, leads us reduction gsm ab metric ggs ab -1 world sheet. read 4 reduced ggs ab using super-coordinates z (, 1) = (x m, ) follows; ggs ab = az bz n gm n , (2.4) gm n reduced background metric 11d supergravity. therefore reach gs-string (gs) action type iia; gs = 2r11tsm z d1q| det ggs ab |, (2.5) r11 radius compactied x 11 coordinate, following condition string tension ts must fullled; ts = 2r11tsm . (2.6) consequently, type iia theory coupled 10d supergravity background obtained procedure double dimensional reduction. 2-2. iia string without double dimensinal reduction arrived subtle, rather essential point. would like focus eliminating mass terms kk nonzero-modes. see another way vanish mass kk-modes beside setting condition (2.3), i.e., without vanishing x 11 dependence. seen following context, nd case, kk nonzero-modes could decouple massless sector. periodic x 11 coordinate s1 coordinate radius r11, nat- urally introduce dimensionless angle parameter , satises x11 = r11 . dierentiation associated x 11 written using r11 follows; x 11 = 1 r11 . (2.7) well-known mass kk-modes yielded factor 1/r11, limit r11 mass kk-modes vanishes. is, kk-modes turn massless modes. important point would like emphasize limit, terms operated /x 11 vanish. hand, terms contain survive change. thus, obtain 5 massless kk nonzero-modes without putting condition (2.3). procedure, see x 11 dependence elds preserved contrast result making ordinary dimensional reduction, is, elds regarded functions dened x 11. therefore, starting supermembrane action (2.1), obtain following action taking limit r11 ; lim r11s sm = z gs( ) gs( ) = r11tsm z d1q| det ggs ab ( ) |. (2.8) (2.9) gs( ) describes x 11-dependent type iia gs-string. case, mass modes turns small. therefore see kk nonzero-modes could decouple massless sector. 3 iia center mass loop order consider lowest states x 11-dependent type iia string (2.9), next deal string center mass. thus following procedure, need take light-cone gauge dimensional reduction along 1 coordinate world-sheet. case type iia string, center mass corresponds lowest state, fact contrast case type iib string. going ahead discussion, let us consider lowest states gs-strings specify type gs-strings, supermultiplet string center mass 256 degrees freedom. 3-1. lowest states center mass rst recall contents gs-string degrees freedom corresponds d=10 super yang-mills multiplet, i.e., eight bose states | vector representation 8v spin(8) labeled letters i, j, eight fermi sates | (or | opposite chirality) spinor representation 8s (or 8c) spin(8) labeled a, b (or a, b). spin(8) contents type iia massless multiplet given tensor product two supermultiplets opposite chirality described 256 states; 128 bose states 6 | | j | | 128 fermi states | | | | j i. case type iib massless multiplet, tensor product two supermultiplets given fermi states chirality; 128 bose states | | j | | b 128 fermi states | | | b | j i. hand, type iia iib equations motion supermultiplets center mass light cone frame follows; type iia : type iib : 2 2 x i( ) = 0, 2 2 x i( ) = 0, s1a( ) = 0, s1(2)a( ) = 0, s2a( ) = 0, (3.1) s1 s2 belong dierent spinor representations 8s 8c. super- multiplets correspond zero modes gs-strings case. thus eq.(3.1), see iia eld contents supermultiplet center mass composed elds three dierent representations spin(8), i.e., 8v, 8s 8c, case type iib, supermultiplet center mass contains two dierent representations spin(8), i.e., 8v 8s (or, 8c). nd supersymmetric lowest states composed supermultiplets center mass follows; case type iia, 256 states identical type iia massless multiplet (that is, 128 bose states | | j | | 128 fermi states | | | | j i), case type iib, 16 states identical type massless multiplet (that is, 8 bose states | 8 fermi states | (or | i)). consequence, nd case type iia, supermultiplet center mass 256 degrees freedom contents massless multiplet 11d supergravity. 3-2. action x 11-dependent iia center mass let us take light-cone gauge dimensional reduction x 11- dependent iia string (2.9), order study lowest states correspond string center mass. rst take light-cone gauge. gauge, world-sheet parameter usually described x +/ l2 p+, (3.2) 7 x + (and x ) denotes light-cone coordinate x = x 0 x 9 2 , (3.3) ls string length. here, free set x + p+ independent x 11 together taking light-cone gauge, although elds thought dependent upon x 11 discussed above. natural take choice independent x 11 equation (3.2). light-cone coordinate x also eliminated due virasoro constraint equations usual. thus, obtain reduced type iia string action light-cone gauge 11d supermembrane action. let us next perform dimensional reduction obtain center mass. procedure corresponds reduce iia string action (2.8) along 1 direction one dimensional action. taking procedure, meant vanishing 1-dependence elds. procedure reduction done putting condition; /1 = 0. world sheet parameter 1 dimensionless, integration respect 1 turns yield 2 alone. finally, obtain following -dependent light-cone action type iia center mass background coming 11d supergravity; s( ) = z dtd x i(t, ) !2 + s1a(t, ) s1a(t, ) + s2a(t, ) s2a(t, ) ! , (3.4) s1 s2 8 component spinors labeled letter a, redened lsp+s. letter runs 1 8. coecient read follows; = 2l2 sp+r11tsm = p+r11 lsgs . (3.5) 8 4 matrix description bfss matrix model description system innite momentum frame along longitudinal direction. situation corresponds taking small r11 limit. model contains n d0-branes well short open strings attached d0-branes. specically large distance scale, string sector becomes massive decouple largely parton sector. distance scale, ma- trices commutative. show bfss matrix model large distance regime derived 11d supermembrane wrapped around 11th direction large r11 limit. discussions consistency resulting matrix description bfss model large r11 limit given next section 5. 4-1. iia center mass diagonal matrices due periodicity , fourier mode expansions x i(t, ), s1(t, ) s2(t, ). must set reality conditions x i, s1, s2; x n = x n , s1 n = s1 n , s2 n = s2 n , (n > 0). (4.1) free set additional reality conditions modes x n, s1 n, s2 n follows; x n = x n , s1 n = s1 n , s2 n = s2 n , (n > 0). (4.2) therefore, following mode expansions; x i(t, ) = s1(t, ) = s2(t, ) = 1 2 1 2 1 2 xn0 xn0 xn0 x n(t) cos n s1 n(t) cos n s2 n(t) cos n (4.3) ordinary treatment fourier expansion, conditions need reality conditions (4.1) original functions x i( ). setting additional reality conditions (4.2), meant functions regarded space coordinates scheme matrix model. 9 let us present matrix description resulting -dependent action previous section. rst substitute eq.(4.3) eq.(3.4), integrate action respect . obtain action; = lim n = lim n n n n x xn=0(cid:20)z dt(cid:16) x n + i(cid:16)s1a z dt tr{( x x i) + }. s1a n + s2a n s2a n (cid:17)(cid:17)(cid:21) (4.4) x denotes nn real matrix index runs 1 8, 16-component spinor direct product two 8-component spinors s1, s2; = (s1, s2)t . (4.5) 4-2. correspondence matrix model clearly, matrices x i, nonzero o-diagonal elements. henceforce, see direction described matrices at, action (4.4) form well-known bfss model direction large distance regime, except matching number components x i. is, bfss model nine x is, action (4.4) contains eight x is. seems dierence supercial one, cases degrees freedom, 256. matrix model, number comes representation algebra 16 fermionic eld 28 components. study dierence two matrix descriptions, let us remember original theory upon bfss model founded, say, = 10 super yang-mills theory. need instead conserved energy-momentum tenser = 10 yang-mills theory supersymmetry. tr f f + 1 4 tr gf f. (4.6) note matrix model direction long distance regime could obtained dimensional reduction = 10 u(1)n super yang-mills theory space direction. dimensional reduction (4.6) associated broken u(1)n gauge symmetry, components reduced following nontrivial components; 00 ij alone. letters i, j 0 label nine space directions 10 time direction, respectively. furthermore, one non-trivial conservation equation survive; 00 amounts dimensionally reduced tr ( ai)2. nd xi=1 9 xi=1 0 00 = 0, 9 (4.7) tr ( ai)2 must constant number. . must recall trace non-zero value contrust case four dimensions. thus, ninth component tr ( a9)2 obtained terms eight components, transverse eight components left independent components; tr ( a9)2 = const. ( ai)2. 8 xi=1 (4.8) matrix model, ai regarded position coordinate x n bounded d0- particles. thus, possible say bosonic matrix coordinate x actually eight components rather nine. moreover, suppose action matrix model describing system low energy n d0-particles large distance regime weak string coupling could pre- served large r11 limit, see action (4.4) actually corresponds matrix model direction large distance regime strong string coupling. henceforce, also identify coupling (3.5) d0-particle mass 1/lsgs; p+r11 lsgs 1 lsgs , (4.9) relation string tension ts assumption wrapped supermembrane taking limit r11 must identied type iia string case ; ts = 2r11tsm (2.6). therefore obtain following relation; p+ 1 lsgs . (4.10) thus, light-cone momentum p+ becomes zero large r11 limit. therefore, momentum 8 space directions thought non-zero value. theory turns free set 9-11 ip space directions limit expected. 11 5 discussions paper, shown matrix model direction large distance regime directly connected 11d theory 256 degrees freedom transverse light-cone frame taking limit r11 . first, let us consider meaning large r11 limit matrix model. taking account relations r11 g2/3 coupling short string scale region. constant lp denotes 11 dimensional p, seems large r11 limit leads us strong string l3 lp l2 planck length. means string sector restricted local regions space-time. need take account eects strings limit. thus, possible say string sector substantially decouple parton sector. situation seems one direction condition large distance regime. therefore, fact shows large r11 limit yields direction matrix model. hand, shown center mass type iia string obtained 11d supermembrane large r11 limit matrix description bfss model. taking matters consideration, see two matrix descriptions consistent limit r11 . would next like comment large n limit large r11 limit. limit r11 , energy whole system matrix model innite energy. order obtain nite energy whole system strong string coupling, necessary take limit n , energy state vanishes like 1/n {$9610043$}. taking large n limit equivalent treating whole fourier modes. thus, energy matrix description derived 11d supermembrane previous section naturally remain nite spite strong string coupling. finally, let us make remark 11th direction. direction crucial one bring longitudinal momentum p11 10d theory nonperturbative r-r charge. scheme so-called matrix string theory {$9703030$}, role 11th direction thought dierent direction leads us get type iia string, e.g., x 9. see paper, dierent roles directions 12 belong one directions strong string coupling, i.e., 11th direction x 11. weak coupling region, situation dierent case strong string coupling ? inference situation change. need appropriate interpretation kk nonzero-modes massive turn, zero-mode corresponds single iia string . seems undeniable kk nonzero-modes correspond matrix model small r11 limit. fact, see correspondence zero-mode mentioned matrix theory. acknowledgment: author would like thank professor s.saito helpful discus- sions careful reading manuscript.
