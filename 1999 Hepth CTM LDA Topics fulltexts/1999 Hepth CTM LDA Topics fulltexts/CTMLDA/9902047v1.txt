abstract

the niteness properties of the n =4 supersymmetric yangmills theory are
reanalyzed both in the component formulation and using n =1 superelds, in or-
der to discuss some subtleties that emerge in the computation of gauge dependent
quantities. the one-loop corrections to various green functions of elementary elds
are calculated.
in the component formulation it is shown that the choice of the
wesszumino gauge, that is standard in supersymmetric gauge theories, introduces
ultraviolet divergences in the propagators at the one-loop level. such divergences
are exactly cancelled when the contributions of the elds that are put to zero in the
wesszumino gauge are taken into account.

in the description in terms of n =1 superelds infrared divergences are found
for every choice of gauge dierent from the supersymmetric generalization of the
fermifeynman gauge. two-, three- and four-point functions of n =1 superelds
are computed and some general features of the infrared problem are discussed.
we also examine the eect of the introduction of mass terms for the (anti)
chiral superelds in the theory, which break supersymmetry from n =4 to n =1.
it is shown that in the mass deformed model no ultraviolet divergences appear
in two-point functions.
it argued that this result can be generalized to n-point
functions, supporting the proposal of a possible of use of this modied model as a
supersymmetry-preserving regularization scheme for n =1 theories.

1 introduction

the action of n =4 four dimensional supersymmetric yangmills theory was given for the
rst time in [1, 2] in the context of toroidal compactications of the type i superstring.
the theory has the maximal amount of supersymmetry allowed for a rigid supersymmetric
theory in four dimensions, namely the symmetry generated by sixteen real supercharges,
and has been proved to be nite, possessing a vanishing -function. for this reason it has
long been considered to be a rather trivial theory. however recent developments in the
study of the correspondence with type iib superstring theory on anti de sitter space have
shown that it is actually a very interesting quantum eld theory, displaying very peculiar
properties.

the eld content of the theory, which is unique apart from the choice of the gauge
group g, consists of six real scalars, four weyl spinors and one vector, which are all in the
adjoint representation of the gauge group g. in the abelian case the theory is free, whereas
in the non abelian case it has a moduli space of vacua parameterized by the vacuum
expectation values (vevs) of the six real scalars. in the coulomb phase, reached giving
non vanishing vevs to the scalars in the cartan subalgebra of g, the theory is again free,
while the origin of the moduli space corresponds to a highly non-trivial superconformal
eld theory.

the model is classically invariant under the n =4 superconformal group and this
property is supposed to be preserved at the quantum level [3, 4]. furthermore it has a
global su(4)so(6) symmetry, which naturally emerges in the compactication from ten
dimensions on a six-torus and is identied, in a four dimensional perspective, with the
r-symmetry group of automorphisms of the n =4 superconformal algebra [5].
the n =4 super yang-mills theory is supposed to exactly realize a generalization of the
electric-magnetic duality of montonen and olive [6] (s-duality), thanks to the presence
in the spectrum of an innite tower of stable bps dyonic states [7, 8, 9].

at the perturbative level the theory is nite up to three loops. the -function has been
shown to be vanishing both in the component formulation [10, 11, 12] and using superspace
techniques [13, 14]. in particular the formulation in terms of n =1 superelds has proved
to be an extremely powerful tool in the perturbative analysis. strong arguments have
been proposed in order to extend the proof of the niteness to all orders in perturbation
theory [3, 4, 15, 16] and moreover general considerations from instanton calculus and
duality arguments suggest that the same should hold at the non-perturbative level [17].
following the proposal of maldacena [18] of a correspondence relating (super) confor-
mal eld theories in d dimensions and type iib superstring theory on d+1 anti de sitter
space there has been recently a renewal of interest in n =4 supersymmetric yangmills
theory. according to this conjectured duality both perturbative [19] and non-perturbative
[20] contributions to correlation functions of gauge invariant composite operators in n =4
super yangmills theory should be related to type iib superstring amplitudes in ads5s5.
work in this context is leading to very interesting results in the study of peculiar proper-
ties of n =4 yangmills theory as a superconformal eld theory.
the aim of this paper is to present a careful re-analysis of perturbation theory, which
allows to point out various problems related to the choice of gauge. both in the component
eld formulation and using n =1 superelds the gauge xing procedure appears very

1

subtle. as we will discuss in detail later, in both cases one nds ultraviolet and/or
infrared divergences in o-shell green functions.

throughout the paper calculations will be carried out in euclidean space. two dif-
ferent formulations of the n =4 supersymmetric yangmills theory will be employed, one
in terms of n =1 superelds and the other in component (physical) elds. notations
and conventions that will be used are those of [22]. the n =4 on-shell multiplet can
be obtained by combining three n =1 chiral superelds and one n =1 vector supereld,
so that the six real scalars of the model are assembled into three complex scalars which,
together with three of the weyl spinors, form the chiral multiplets, the fourth spinor and
the vector gives rise to the vector multiplet. in this description a su(3)u(1) subgroup
of the su(4) r-symmetry group is manifest. the component-eld formulation that will
be used is directly related to that in n =1 superspace, actually it is obtained from the
former by integrating over the grassmannian coordinates of n =1 superspace.
in the component formulation the propagators of the elementary elds are ultraviolet
divergent in the wesszumino (wz) gauge and these innities are exactly cancelled when
the contributions of the gauge-dependent elds, that are put to zero in the wz gauge,
are taken into account. the choice of the wz gauge, that is almost unavoidable in explicit
computations, introduces divergences that require a wave function renormalization.

dierent problems emerge in the formulation of the theory in terms of n =1 superelds.
almost all of the calculations showing the vanishing of the quantum corrections to two-
and three-point functions, that are presented in the literature, were performed in the
supersymmetric generalization of the fermifeynman gauge. with a dierent choice of
gauge two- and three-point functions develop infrared singularities, leading to the result
that the choice of the fermifeynman gauge is somehow privileged. this conclusion was
proposed for the rst time in [21] and then it was discussed in the case of the n =4 theory
in [23]; however no possible explanation was proposed. unlike those of the elementary
elds, correlation functions of gauge invariant composite operators, that play a crucial
role in the correspondence with ads type iib supergravity/superstring theory, should
not suer from problems related to the gauge xing.

we will also discuss, in the supereld formulation, the eect of introducing of a mass
term for the (anti) chiral superelds, which breaks supersymmetry from n =4 down to
n =1. it is shown that this deformation of the model does not modify the ultraviolet
properties of the original theory. this result was rst proposed in [24], where it was
proved that the inclusion of mass terms for the (anti) chiral superelds does not generate
divergent corrections to the eective action. we will argue that this statement can be
reinforced, showing that, at least at one loop, no new divergences, not even corresponding
to wave function renormalizations, appear as a consequence of the addition of the mass
terms. this result supports the claim put forward in [25, 26], where the mass deformed
n =4 theory was proposed as a supersymmetry-preserving regularization scheme for a
class of n =1 theories.
the paper is organized as follows. section 2 deals with the problems introduced by the
choice of the wesszumino gauge when the component formalism is used. the following
sections report calculations performed in the n =1 supereld formalism of two-, three-
and four-point functions. a discussion of the results is presented in the concluding section.

2 perturbation theory in components: problems with

the wesszumino gauge

as already remarked the eld content of n =4 super yangmills theory can be obtained
by coupling in a gauge invariant way one n =1 vector supereld va(x, , ) and three chiral
superelds i
a(x, , ), i = 1, 2, 3, all in the adjoint representation of the gauge group g,
so that the colour index a takes the values a = 1, 2, . . . , dim g. a su(3)u(1) subgroup
of the su(4) r-symmetry group is manifest and under this global symmetry the chiral
superelds i transform in the 3, while the vector v is a singlet.

the complete expression for v is

v (x, , ) = c(x) + i(x)  i(x) +
+i(cid:20)(x) +

v = v   v = ilv /2h( +  + coth(lv /2)(  )i ,

(2)

where la(b) = [a, b] is the lie derivative and (2) is a compact form to be understood in
terms of the power expansion of coth(l). by explicitly writing the component expansion of
these relations one can show that it is always possible to put to zero the lower components,
c,  and s, of v by a suitable gauge transformation. as a result for the supereld v one
obtains

this choice is known as the wesszumino gauge. fixing the wesszumino gauge still
leaves with the ordinary non abelian gauge freedom on the remaining elds.

in this section we will discuss perturbation theory in components. the one-loop cor-
rection to the propagators of elementary elds will be computed rst in the wess-zumino
gauge and then taking into account the contribution of the elds c,  and s that are
absent in this gauge. we will show that the choice of the wz gauge introduces ultraviolet
divergences in the propagators.

the standard formulation of the model is obtained by eliminating the auxiliary elds,
f i from the chiral multiplet and d from the vector multiplet. this procedure in the
wz gauge results in a polynomial action with a scalar potential containing a quadrilinear
term for the scalars. however in order to correctly deal with the lower components of the
vector supereld v , that are put to zero in the wesszumino gauge, it is more convenient
not to eliminate the auxiliary elds through their equations of motion, but rather keep
them in the action:
in the computation of green functions the corresponding x-space
propagators are -functions.

the action is written in terms of the non abelian eld strength supereld w

note that the scalar eld c and the spinor  have wrong physical dimension, resulting in
non standard free propagators, as will be shown below. the interaction part sint contains
an innite number of terms. the propagators of the fermions i and of the scalars i
belonging to the n =1 chiral multiplets will now be computed at one loop. the terms
that are relevant for these calculations come from the expansion of v  and v 2 in
(6). the latter generates tadpole type diagrams in the propagator hi, but not in hi.

to summarize beyond the ordinary propagators for the physical elds, , ,  and a,
and those for the auxiliary elds, f and d, one further obtains the propagators hssi,
hcdi, hi and hi. the latter are absent in the wesszumino gauge.

2.1 one loop corrections to the propagator of the fermions be-

longing to the chiral multiplet

the one-loop correction to the propagator of the fermions i in the chiral multiplet is
the simplest to compute. in the wz gauge there are three contributions at the one loop
level, that will be shown to lead to a logarithmically divergent result.

from the action (8), (9), with c==s=0 one obtains the following three diagrams

notice that the insertion of tadpoles such as

in a diagram gives a vanishing result because all the propagators are diagonal in colour
space, so that the tadpole contains a factor abf abc  0. the same is true also for diagrams
in n =1 superspace that will be discussed in subsequent sections.

equation (17) shows that a logarithmically divergent wave function renormalization is
required in the wz gauge.

this divergence will now be shown to be a gauge artifact due to the choice of the wz

2.2 one loop corrections to the propagator of the scalars be-

longing to the chiral multiplet

the calculation of the propagator hi is more complicated because more diagrams are
involved. in particular tadpole type graphs, coming from the term v 2 in the action,
are present. however the result is analogous to what was found for the hi propagator:
in the wz gauge the one-loop correction is logarithmically ultraviolet-divergent, requiring
a wave function renormalization, but when the contributions neglected in the wz gauge
are taken into account the total one-loop result vanishes.

the diagrams contributing to hi at the one-loop level in the wesszumino gauge

are the following

the last three diagrams are all tadpole corrections since the free propagators for the
auxiliary elds f and d are -functions, so that the corresponding lines shrink to a point.
each one of these diagrams is quadratically divergent. there is also a quadratically
divergent contribution coming from the two diagrams b(x, y) and c(x, y) and the sum of
all these terms exactly vanishes. the total sum gives a nal result that is logarithmically
divergent. in momentum space it is schematically of the form

single diagrams contain quadratically divergent terms that cancel in the sum leaving a
total contribution that is again logarithmically divergent. this correction is exactly what
is needed to cancel the divergence in (20). as a result the complete one-loop correction
to the hi propagator is actually zero.
notice that the situation induced by the choice of the wz gauge is a feature common
to every supersymmetric gauge theory, since the contribution of the gauge-dependent
elds c,  and s is in general logarithmically divergent. however in theories with less
supersymmetry a logarithmic wave function renormalization is in any case unavoidable, so
that this eect is completely irrelevant. on the contrary it becomes important in the n =4
yangmills theory and in general in nite theories. of course the divergences encountered
here are gauge artifacts and disappear in gauge invariant correlation functions. examples
of computations of correlators of gauge invariant operators, in which the choice of the wz
gauge does not lead to this kind of problems, have been considered within the discussion
of the correspondence with type iib superstring theory on ads space, [19, 20].

the calculations we described seem to suggest the possibility of constructing improved
feynman rules in which the eect of the gauge dependent elds, set to zero in the wz
gauge, is dealt with by a suitable redenition of the free propagators. however this pro-

12

gram proves extremely complicated when the propagators of elds in the vector multiplet
or three- and more-point functions are considered. the calculation of these correlation
functions, already at the one-loop level, requires many other terms to be included in the
action sint. in particular terms coming from w (1)w (2) and w (2)w (2) must be considered.
the calculation of w (2) without the simplications introduced by the wesszumino gauge
is rather lengthy and gives

substituting (21) into sint results in a number of relevant interaction terms of the order
of 100, making this formulation totally impractical in explicit calculations. in conclusion
perturbation theory in components almost unavoidably requires the wz gauge, but the
latter introduces divergences in gauge dependent quantities. in the following sections the
supereld formalism, that allows to avoid these problems, will be employed. however we
will show that new diculties related to ordinary gauge xing emerge.

3 perturbation theory in n =1 superspace: propaga-

tors

the diculties encountered in the previous section in the calculation of gauge dependent
quantities, because of the divergences present in the wesszumino gauge, can be overcome
using the supereld formulation.

because of the lack of a completely consistent n =4 formulation, we will employ the
n =1 supereld formalism which has proved to be a powerful tool in the proof of the
niteness of the theory up to three loops. in this approach there is no particular diculty
in working without xing the wz gauge. if one does not choose to work in the wz gauge
the action is non polynomial, however a nite number of terms is relevant at each order
in perturbation theory, so that only at very high order the choice of the wesszumino
gauge introduces signicant simplications. the aim of this section is to show that there

13

are other subtleties related to further xing the gauge for the vector supereld, even if
one does not work in the wz gauge.

to be more general and for the purpose of studying the possibility of nding a super-
symmetric regularization of a class of n =1 theories, following the proposal of [25, 26], we
will consider a formulation in n =1 superspace of n =4 super yangmills theory deformed
with the addition of mass terms for the (anti) chiral superelds

the inclusion of this terms to the action breaks n =4 supersymmetry down to n =1. in
[24] it was argued, by means of dimensional arguments, that this term should not aect
the ultraviolet properties of the n =4 theory. more precisely the statement of [24] is that
no divergences appear in gauge invariant quantities, so that no divergent contribution to
the quantum eective action is generated perturbatively. as a result the model obtained
in this way would be an example of a nite n =1 theory. the inverse construction,
in which one deforms a n =1 model to n =4 super yangmills plus a mass term, has
been proposed in [25, 26] as a regularization procedure preserving supersymmetry. the
calculations presented in this section will show that in the presence of the term (22) no
divergence is generated, at the one-loop level, in the two-, three- and four-point green
functions that are computed. the results presented suggest the possibility of reinforcing
the conclusions of [24]; namely the n =4 theory augmented with (22) appears to be
nite in the sense that no divergences appear in the complete n-point irreducible green
functions, at least at one loop. in particular no wave function renormalization is required.
notice that this result is what is actually necessary for the consistency of the approach
advocated in [25, 26].

where dots stand for terms that are not relevant for the considerations of this paper.

notice that in the action (24) a gauge xing term corresponding to a family of gauges
parameterized by  = 1
 has been introduced. it will now be shown, by explicitly comput-
ing the propagators of both the chiral and the vector superelds, that the supersymmetric

2in the following the mass parameter m will be taken to be real for simplicity of notation.

14

generalization of the fermifeynman gauge, corresponding to  = 1, is somehow priv-
ileged (see also [23, 27]), since any other choice of the parameter  leads to infrared
divergences in green functions.

3.1 propagator of the chiral supereld

the propagator of the chiral supereld is the simplest green function to compute. the
calculation will be reported in detail in order to illustrate the supereld technique.

it follows from the form of the action (24) that there are three diagrams contributing
to the propagator hi at the one loop level. the one-particle irreducible parts of
these diagrams will be directly evaluated in momentum space using the improved super
feynman rules of [28]. the convention employed is that all momenta are taken to be
incoming. the diagrams are the following

in the above expressions an infrared regulator  has been introduced. notice that the
total correction (31) is exactly zero on-shell, i.e. for p2=m2.

to summarize the results, the propagator of the chiral superelds of the n =4 super
yangmills theory in n =1 superspace is logarithmically infrared-divergent for any choice
of the gauge parameter  6= 1. this divergence corresponds to a wave function renormal-
ization for the superelds i. in the fermifeynman gauge =1 the one-loop correction
exactly vanishes.

18

3.2 propagator of the vector supereld

the one-loop calculation of the propagator of the vector supereld is much more compli-
cated, because many more diagrams are involved producing a large number of contribu-
tions. the nal result is however completely analogous: in the fermifeynman gauge the
one-loop correction is zero, whereas o-shell infrared divergences arise for  6= 1. in the
presence of a mass term for the (anti) chiral superelds no new divergences are generated.
from a calculational viewpoint the new feature with respect to the hi case is
that there are also diagrams involving the ghosts. there are two multiplets of ghosts,
described by the chiral superelds c and c . the free propagators for these superelds
will be denoted by

the ghosts are treated exactly like ordinary chiral superelds with the only dierence
that there is a minus sign associated with loops, because c and c  are anticommuting
elds [28]

the contributions a to e are rather straightforward to evaluate much in the same way
as the diagrams entering the hi propagator. the last two graphs are more involved
because the free propagator for the v supereld is more complicated for generic values of
the parameter . moreover the cubic and quartic vertices

gives rise to six dierent terms.

schematically the calculation goes as follows. a(p) is a new contribution that appears
because of the addition of the mass terms (22); it is not present in the n =4 theory,
i.e. when m=0. it is useful to discuss separately the corrections coming from diagrams
a, b and c and those obtained from di, ei, f and g, since the latter correspond to
the one-loop contribution to the vector supereld propagator in the n =1 supersymmetric
yangmills theory.

notice that in particular the logarithmically divergent contribution proportional to m2
exactly cancels out. this is crucial because this correction would correspond to a mass
renormalization for the vector supereld that is known to be excluded in any gauge theory
as well as in supersymmetric theories in general.

the diagrams di and ei are completely analogous to the previous ones, with the only
dierence that the mass does not appear in the denominators and there is a minus sign
associated with the loops. their sum is logarithmically divergent and takes the form

be summed to those coming from the last two diagrams. f exactly vanishes for any ,
so that only e needs to be considered. this diagram produces in principle 72 corrections
because the feynman rules give rise to 18 terms (distributing the covariant derivatives
associated with the two vertices), each of which splits into 4, since the free propagator
itself contains two terms. many of these contributions can be easily shown to vanish using
the properties of the covariant derivatives. in particular one uses

which follows from d
is useful to separate in the non-vanishing part terms proportional to  and 2, from the
-independent terms. the latter combine to give a logarithmically divergent correction
that together with that of equation (36) cancel the correction (35) coming from the sum
a + b + c. actually if m 6= 0 this sum is nite and exactly vanishes at m=0. as a
result the only non-vanishing corrections to the vector supereld propagator at the one
loop level come from terms proportional to  and to 2 in e(p). the former contain an
infrared divergent part of the form

singular unless the fermifeynman gauge, =1, is chosen, in which case it vanishes. like
in the case of the chiral supereld propagator the non-vanishing -dependent corrections
could be reabsorbed by a wave function renormalization of the supereld v and are zero
on-shell, i.e. for p2=0.

the proof of the niteness of the theory in the presence of the mass terms (22) given in
[24] is based on naive power counting, which gives for the supercial degree of divergence,
d, of a diagram in n =1 superspace [30]

d = 2  e  c ,

where e is the number of external (anti) chiral lines and c the number of  or 
propagators. in [24] it is also argued that for corrections to the eective action involving
only v superelds the requirement of gauge invariance reduces the degree of divergence
to

d = c .

however for the purposes of [25, 26] it appears crucial that no divergences, not even cor-
responding to a wave function renormalization, be present in complete n-point functions
for any n. the computation of the two-point functions in this section has shown that this
actually the case at one loop. an argument for the generalization of this result to green
functions with an arbitrary number of external v lines will now be briey sketched. first
note that diagrams involving only vector and ghost superelds are not modied by the
inclusion of (22), so that one must only consider graphs containing internal chiral lines.
the ultraviolet properties of diagrams that are only logarithmically divergent in the orig-
inal n =4 theory are not modied by the presence of the mass in the propagators. thus
the contributions that we need to analyze are the quadratically divergent ones, which can
acquire subleading logarithmic singularities, plus eventually new diagrams involving 
and  propagators. the relevant quadratic divergences come from tadpole diagrams

v an

v bn

v a2

v a1

v b2

v b1

the only new diagram containing  and  propagators that must be considered is

23

v an

v bn

v a2

v a1

v b2

v b1

the only covariant derivatives that are associated with the vertices in these graphs come
from the functional derivatives and must act on the internal (anti) chiral lines to give a
non-vanishing result. as a consequence the loop integral in the above diagrams is exactly
the same as for the c and a corrections to the v v propagator. hence summing to the
previous diagrams the contribution of

v an

v bn

v a2

v a1

v b2

v b1

leads to a net logarithmically divergent correction that is exactly the same as the one
obtained in the original n =4 theory. like in the latter case this divergence will be
cancelled by the contributions coming from the other one-loop diagrams involving v and
ghost internal lines. the argument given here reinforces the results of [24], at least at
the one-loop level, and supports the proposal, put forward in [25, 26], according to which
the mass deformed n =4 model can be considered a consistent supersymmetry-preserving
regularization for (a class of) n =1 theories.
notice that for the previous discussion it is not necessary to consider equal masses for
all the (anti) chiral superelds. the same results can be proved giving dierent masses
to the three superelds. this can be easily understood since in each diagram considered
in this section only one chiral/anti-chiral pair is involved, because the propagators are
diagonal in avor space and the vertices containing vector and (anti) chiral superelds
couple 
i and i with the same index i. basically this means that the above discussed
cancellations apply separately to the contributions of each (anti) chiral supereld. from
the viewpoint of the dimensional analysis of [24] having dierent masses mi is irrelevant.
as a consequence one can in particular give mass to only two of the (anti) chiral
multiplets. this suggests the possibility of generalizing the approach of [25, 26] to the
case of n =2 super yangmills theories. a discussion of the eect of a n =2 mass term
in n =4 supersymmetric yangmills theory can be found in [31].

4 three- and four-point functions of n =1 superelds

the computation of green functions with three and four external legs will now be consid-
ered. from now on the fermifeynman gauge will be assumed. the three-point functions
are expected to suer from infrared problems of the kind encountered in the preceding
section. this issue will not be addressed here since the calculation with  6= 1 is quite
involved, even at the one-loop level, because of the huge number of contributions. four-
point functions on the contrary should be infrared nite, because they are directly related
to physical scattering amplitudes. notice, however, that infrared divergences in the green
function with four external v lines were found in [32] with  6= 1. in that paper beyond
the infrared singularity, it was shown that the adimensionality of the supereld v implies
that it requires a non-linear renormalization, in the sense that the renormalized eld vr
will be a non-linear function of the bare eld v

an example of three-point function will be briey discussed here and then the more

interesting case of a four-point function will be studied in greater detail.

vr = f (v ) .

4.1 three-point functions

the simplest three point function that one can consider corresponds to the correction to

the vertex ijktr(cid:16)i j k(cid:17) (or ijktr(cid:16)
i 

k(cid:17)), which is determined by one single
j 

diagram at the one loop level. however, as a less trivial example of computation of
three-point functions, the one-loop correction to the vertex

j

b (z)

a

i (z)

vc(z)

 (cid:16)a

i v ci

b(cid:17) (z)

will be considered here. the correction at the one-loop level comes from the following
diagrams (the notation for the propagators is the same as in the previous section)

the calculation of these diagrams is completely analogous to those that were presented
in the previous section. the last two diagrams are nite and vanish in the n =4 theory,
i.e. at m=0, as they are proportional to m2; they will not be considered here. the other
contributions will be briey studied in the limit m=0.

the diagram d(p, q) is zero as a consequence of the contraction among the colour
indices, so that there are ve contributions to be calculated. dimensional analysis gives a
vanishing supercial degree of divergence d, corresponding to a logarithmic divergence, for
the green function under consideration. single diagrams actually contain a logarithmi-
cally divergent term plus nite terms. a straightforward but rather lengthy computation,
based on elementary d-algebra, allows to prove that the divergent part of all the diagrams
is of the form

ilog = c i

ai (p, , )vb(p  q, , )j
where c is a constant. moreover one nds a nite contribution of the form

c (q, , )o ,



where c1 and c2 are numerical constants. the sum of all the logarithmically divergent
terms contained in the diagrams a, b, c, e and f vanishes. the residual nite part can
be shown to be zero as well.

in conclusion the one-loop correction to the three-point function hv i exactly van-
ishes in the fermifeynman gauge. the same result can be shown to hold for the other
three-point functions.

27

the supereld formalism does not lead to signicant simplications in the calculation
of three-point functions with respect to the same computation in components (in the
wesszumino gauge!). actually for the green function considered here the number of
diagrams to be evaluated is approximately the same as in the component formulation.
however the power of superspace techniques becomes clear in the computation of four-
point functions that will be considered in next subsection.

4.2 four-point functions

the computation of four-point functions in components is extremely complicated even at
the one-loop level and in the wesszumino gauge. in this case the choice of the wz gauge
should not lead to extra divergences because the complete four-point function must nally
give the physical scattering amplitude. in the n =1 supereld formulation the calculation
of four-point functions, though rather lengthy, is much more simple.
in this section the computation of the one-particle irreducible one-loop correction to
the green function hi in the fermifeynman gauge will be presented. there
are several diagrams to be considered: each of them is free of ultraviolet divergences, as
immediately follows from dimensional analysis. moreover in the fermifeynman gauge
each single diagram is infrared nite. in conclusion one nds a nite and non-vanishing
result.

the rst subset of contributions corresponds to the diagram

 6= 1, because in that case there would be projectors acting on the s. the vanishing

notice that, since in the fermifeynman gauge the one-loop corrections to the prop-
agators and vertices are zero, the total cross section is completely determined by the
sum of the above contributions, which is non vanishing for on-shell external momenta,
i.e. p2=q2=r2=0.

in the presence of a mass term for the (anti) chiral superelds the expressions given
above are modied by the presence of the mass in the free propagators and furthermore
there are two additional sets of contributions corresponding to the diagrams

both of these graphs give corrections proportional to m2, that can be calculated much in
the same way as the previous ones.

5 discussion

the infrared divergences found in the calculation of the propagators of the chiral and the
vector superelds are due to the fact that the vector supereld is dimensionless, so that

34

it contains in particular, as its lowest component, the scalar c that is itself dimensionless
and hence has a propagator which behaves, in momentum space, like

h(cc)(k)i 

1
k4

.

the contribution of the scalar c to the hv v i propagator leads to an infrared divergence
whenever a diagram contains a loop involving a v v line. in the fermifeynman gauge
the problem is not present because the choice  = 1 gives a kinetic matrix of the form
of equation (12) in the component expansion. the corresponding inverse matrix m 1 in
(13) shows that no hcci free propagator is present. on the contrary any choice  6= 1
produces such a propagator, i.e. gives a matrix m 1 with a non-vanishing (m 1)11 entry,
leading to the previously discussed infrared problem. an explicit calculation in compo-
nents with  6= 1 and without xing the wesszumino gauge should display problematic
infrared divergences analogous to those encountered here. these problems with infrared
divergences are not peculiar of the n =4 super yangmills theory, but appear in any su-
persymmetric gauge theory. analogous infrared divergences in green functions have been
observed in [27, 32]. the conclusion proposed in these papers is that there exist no way
to remove the infrared divergences, so that the choice =1 is somehow necessary, at least
for the computation of gauge-dependent quantities.

there are two general theorems concerning infrared divergences in quantum eld the-
ory. the rst is the kinoshitaleenauenberg theorem [33], which deals with infrared
divergences in cross sections. it states that no infrared problem is present in physical cross
sections of a renormalizable quantum eld theory, if the appropriate sums over degenerate
initial and nal states, associated with soft and collinear particles, are considered. the
second theorem was proved by kinoshita, poggio and quinn [34] and concerns green
functions. the statement of the theorem is that the proper (one-particle irreducible)
euclidean green functions with non-exceptional external momenta are free of infrared
divergences in a renormalizable quantum eld theory. a set of momenta pi, i = 1, 2, . . . , n
is said to be exceptional if any of the partial sums

pi ,

xii

with i a subset of {1, 2, . . . , n} ,

vanishes. the reason for the absence of divergences is that the external momenta, if
non-exceptional, play the role of an infrared regulator in the green functions.

k4 propagator.

the proof of the theorem is based on dimensional analysis which does not work in
the presence of a 1
in particular it fails in the case of supersymmetric
gauge theories in general gauges, because the adimensionality of the v supereld im-
plies that a propagator 1
k4 can appear in loop integrals. the apparent violation of the
kinoshitapoggioquinn theorem can be understood from the viewpoint of the component
formulation: supersymmetric gauge theories, being non-polynomial and thus containing
an innite number of interaction terms, are not formally renormalizable. the choice of
the wesszumino gauge makes the theory polynomial. in fact in this case no infrared
divergence is found in green functions and the general theorems are satised. however
in the case of the n =4 theory the choice of the wz gauge results in a change of the ul-
traviolet properties of the model, at least for what concerns gauge dependent quantities,
e.g. the propagators.

35

in theories with less supersymmetry, in which ultraviolet divergences are present the
problem might be less severe, since the subtraction of the ultraviolet innities could also
cure infrared singularities.

the infrared problems discussed here are however gauge artifacts and cannot aect
gauge invariant quantities. the mechanism leading to the cancellation of infrared diver-
gences in gauge independent green functions has not been veried in detail yet, but can
be understood starting from the super feynman rules. when the propagator hv v i is in-
serted into a feynman graph it is connected to vertices which carry covariant derivatives.
these derivatives come directly from the form of the action for vertices involving only
v elds and from the denition of the functional derivatives for vertices involving (anti)
chiral superelds. the situation in diagrams for gauge invariant quantities is such that at
least one covariant derivative can always be brought to act on the v propagator by inte-
grations by parts. in this way an additional factor of the momentum k is generated in the
numerator. more precisely for the infrared problematic term  1
one gets

a rigorous and general check of this mechanism in gauge invariant green functions has
not been achieved yet.

with a gauge choice dierent from the fermifeynman gauge the computation of
four-point green functions is more complicated. single diagrams involving vector super-
eld propagators contain new contributions, some of which are infrared divergent. the
correction c is not zero anymore, because there are projection operators acting on the
-functions. moreover further diagrams must be included in the calculation of scattering
amplitudes at the same order as a consequence of the non-vanishing of the one-loop cor-
rection to the propagators and vertices. for example one must consider diagrams such
as

a

l

as well as diagrams obtained by the insertion of one-loop corrections to the propagators in
tree graphs. notice that the inclusion of these contributions, each one separately infrared
divergent, is fundamental in order to get a nite total cross section.

36

the techniques illustrated in this paper for the calculation of green functions in the
n =1 formalism can be applied to correlation functions of composite operators as well.
green functions of gauge invariant composite operators such as those that form the mul-
tiplet of currents (see [35] for the explicit form of the multiplet in the abelian case) play
a crucial role in the correspondence with type iib superstring theory on ads space. the
application of n =1 superspace to this problem has not been considered here, but is under
active investigation [36]. it can be shown that the extension of the formalism to the case
of composite operators is in principle rather straightforward, the fundamental dierence
being that the complete green functions and not the proper parts must be considered.
