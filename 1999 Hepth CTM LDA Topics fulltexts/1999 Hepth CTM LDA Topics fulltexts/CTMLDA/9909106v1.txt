the oscillating ination model recently proposed by damour and mukhanov

is investigated with a non-minimal coupling. numerical study conrms an ina-

tionary behavior and the density perturbation is obtained. a successful ination

requires the gravity-dilaton coupling to be small.

recently, damour and mukhanov [1] proposed an ination model with os-

cillating inaton elds in the einstein gravity context. meanwhile, dilaton-like

elds are natural candidates for inaton elds, because generally inatons are sup-

posed to be gauge singlets. furthermore, the extended gravity sector is common

to unied theories such as supergravity, superstring/m-theory and kaluza-klein

theory[2]. these dilaton elds might be stabilized by some potential, which could

be an inaton potential. in these respects, in this paper, we study an oscillating

ination with non-minimal coupling.

we consider an action of non-minimally coupled scalar theory which is given

by[3]

which was suggested by damour and mukhanov[1]. here a,q and 0 are con-

stants. the equations of motion for the scale factor a and  from the action

(eq.(1)) with the metric ds2 = dt2 + a(t)2dx2 are

where the prime denotes d/dt and h  a/a. to see whether oscillating ination
really happens in this model, we do numerical study. a typical signal of an

oscillating ination is an increasing and wiggling curve of ah versus t. the

result of numerical calculation shows this curve(fig.1.) and conrms inationary

behaviours.

now let us show that  < q  1 is a good parameter range for our model with
the damour-mukhanov potential and calculate the density perturbation. the

cobe observation requires h  2  105. since the oscillating ination phase
is generally short, the observed perturbation is supposed to be generated during

a slow-roll phase. from eq.(3) and eq.(4) and with slow-roll conditions one can

obtain[4]

where 2 = 8/m 2

p . since during the slow-roll phase   0 , one can approxi-

mate the damour-mukhanov potential as

(6)

however, for q  1 which is required for the oscillating ination[1], such a poly-
nomial potential with small exponent brings the following problem with non-

minimal coupling[5]; when q  1 the rst term in eq.(5) is larger than the
second one and the former gives a force which prevents  rolling down to the

potential minimum. one can overcome this problem by simply choosing the pa-

3

rameters satisfying

22 < q/(4  q)  1.

since for the potential the number of e-folds of expansion during the slow-roll is

given by

one can obtain a sucient expansion with initial  = n  mp . then the above
condition(eq.(7)) becomes  < 1/8n. furthermore, it is known that for   1,
the density perturbation is proportional to h 2/|| as usual[6]. therefore, in this
limit, [7]

is a good approximation up to o() within the mentioned parameter ranges( <

q  1). the term with  represents the eect of non-minimal coupling which
is dominated by the last term, 22/q for q  1. therefore in the marginal
case( 22/q  1

(10)

since one can easily change the magnitude of h by choosing constants in the

potential such as a and 0, one need to observe the spectral index n of the pertur-

bation rather than the magnitude of it. the background radiation observation

since

(11)

where k is a wave number of the perturbation [10], the deviation of n between

the oscillating ination with einstein gravity and with the non-minimal coupling

is

where d/dlnk = (m 2
p /8v )dv /d. the rst term contributes 1010 to n
which is too small to be observed by the satellites. using 1  n  (q + 2)/2n for
chaotic ination with v  q [11], one can nd that even in the marginal case
the second term is about 22/30q  1/120, which is rather smaller than the
accuracy of planck n  0.02. so it is hard to expect the observations could
distinguish the two models near future.

now let us check ination conditions during the oscillating phase. the scale

factor also satises the following equation;

a
a

=

2

1 + 22 h2(1 + 3) + v ()  3(h + )i .

(13)

we adopt a reasonable assumption that during the oscillation the friction term is

negligible (   3h) and the eective mass squared of the eld (see eq.(4))

m2 

d2v ()
d2  6(h  + 2h 2)  h 2.

(14)

since the typical period of an oscillation is 1/m, one can ignore the variation of

h ( and the h  dependent term ) during a single oscillation. one can also easily

nd that in eq.(14), h 2 dependent term should be small relative to d2v /d2,

especially when   1. so it is a good approximation that   dv /d. since
we expect that the present value of u() is equal to mp /16, the present value

of  should be 0. so the limit 22  0 is a reasonable assumption near the
potential minimum and for   1. in this limit and with hi = h2i the
ination condition is

* a
a +  d2h2(1 + 3) + v ()  3(h + )ie

 2d2 + v ()e > 0,

where the bracket denotes a time average during an oscillation period.

with  = dv /d this reduces to
*v  

dv

d+ > 0,

(15)

(16)

which is the result of ref.[1]. of course, this is simply due to the fact that

in this limit the system becomes that with einstein gravity. so, our model is

self-consistent at least when  < q  1.

in summary, in the context of the non-minimal coupling, we investigate the

oscillating ination and calculate the density perturbation during the slow-roll

phase with the damour-mukhanov potential.
