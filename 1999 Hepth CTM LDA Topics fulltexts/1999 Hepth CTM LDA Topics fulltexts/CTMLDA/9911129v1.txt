closed form eective conformal anomaly actions in d4

abstract

we present closed-form coordinate invariant eective actions for both types a and b of
weyl anomalies in all dimensions d4. their nonlocalities reect (as they must) the anomalies
underlying loop diagram origins.
in particular, despite contrary appearances, the properly
interpreted riegertpolyakov type a actions do yield the anomalies and reproduce the lowest
order pole structure. for type b, where no correct candidate existed, our action both varies
correctly and reects the proper cuto  and logarithmic scale  dependence. it is constructed
in terms of novel weyl invariant tensor operators.

introduction

the nature of conformal or weyl anomalies beyond the (unique) polyakov action at d=2 level is
reasonably well established.
in particular, we know [1] that there exist two families, with very
distinct origins (in terms of the ir and uv parts of the underlying matter closed loops) and
characteristics (in terms of their own weyl variations) in arbitrary even dimension d=2n (there
are no weyl anomalies in odd d). there must exist eective actions, whose weyl variations yield
the respective anomalies expressed in terms of a background gravitational eld, that keep track of
the eects of integrating out the matter closed loops. the actions should be covariantizations of

lowest order expressions i0[g]  r g g < t..t > g and are necessarily nonlocal (any

local parts are irrelevant) but their weyl variations under

g = 2(x)g , g = dg

(1)

yield local anomalies a(x)  i[g ]/(x). the built-in integrability condition on second varia-
tions,
(2)

a(x)/(x) = 2i/(x)(x) = a(x)/(x)

serves as a useful check on candidate as and on form of compensator eld actions.

the origin of the anomalies in closed loop graphs imposes obvious constraints on the actions
momentum dependence. these seem to clash with the formally attractive dieomorphism-invariant
d4 generalizations of the d=2 action for type a, and make type b actions (which start at d=4)
hard to dene at all. let us briey recall the minimal requirements on eective actions in the present
context. first, they must obviously vary into the local anomalies a(x); this also dictates their
momentum dimension and nonlocality structure. secondly, loss of classical conformal invariance
having been accepted as the price for preserving coordinate invariance, they must be invariants.
on the other hand, they need not be unique, i.e., there can and (as we will show) do, exist nonlocal
weyl invariants. nor do they have to be obtainable (unlike in d=2) by integrating out an action

for a compensating eld that is physically acceptable (e.g., ghost-free); indeed we will see this is
unlikely in d>2.

in this paper, i present complete, closed form actions satisfying the above requirements for
both types a and b in all d, most explicitly in d=4, as well as a weyl-invariant nonlocal action
to demonstrate non-uniqueness. for type a the correct action is that proposed by riegert [2], as
an extension of the d=2 polyakov form to d=4. while it seemed to yield the anomaly (though its
form must be slightly improved), it also seemingly violated a single pole (1) nonlocality required
by dimension, having instead an explicit 2 factor. this dimensionality paradox disappears when
two facts are taken into account: rst, the demand that dieomorphism invariance be manifest
i.e., that everything has to be expressed in terms of curvature (to lowest order expansion of the
action about at space) is not mandatory and second, the single pole requirement only constrains
the lowest order part; suitable use of the rst freedom will indeed turn 2 into 1 there. at
higher orders, higher poles can and indeed should be present. for type b, a riegert-like expression
(the only extant candidate) is not only of wrong dimension but does not, in fact, vary correctly.
instead, i provide proper all-order eective actions through use of new operators, weyl-invariant
when acting on the weyl tensor, that are compatible with the physics.

2 type a: d=2 revisited

in d=2, where type a is the only possible anomaly, things are as usual very simple; they are also
very (sometimes too!) suggestive for generalizing to d=4 and beyond. by power counting alone,
the anomaly a(x) must have dimension 2; the only local dieo-invariant is the euler density e2(x),
(3)

a(x) = g r(x)  e2(x), e2(x)  2g 

whose weyl variation is also indicated (overall constant coecients are omitted for brevity). from
(2), integrability of a is manifest:

e2(x)/(x)  2g 2(x  x)  e2(x)/(x)

(4)

note also that the scalar density operator 2  g , when  and only when  acting on a scalar

is itself weyl invariant at d=2,

2  [(g g ) ] = 0 .

together, the behavior (2,4) of e2 and 2 under variation mean that

(e2/2) = 2(x)

(5)

(6)

i.e., that this nonlocal scalar operator acts like a weyl compensator eld. this is of course what
underlies the polyakov construction,

i2 = 1

4 r d2xe21

2 e2 ,

i2/(x) = e2(x) .

(7a)

strictly speaking, use of (5) in varying (7a) is not entirely correct as 2 must act on a scalar, rather
than on a density like e2 to be invariant; this is easily remedied here, by writing (7a) as

i2 = 1

4 r g (e21

2 )(e2/g ) ,

2

(7b)

whose variation is more easily veried (see below) than is (7a) to yield

i2/(x) = e2(x) .

(7c)

this seeming pedanticism will be better appreciated in d4. the action (7) is necessarily nonlocal,
so that i2 cannot be absorbed as a local counterterm might. the pole behavior of the action is
clearly  p2, in accord with the power counting of the 2-point closed loop  (r d2p/p4)r2
l where
rl  (pph) is the linearized scalar curvature in an expansion about at space, g =  + h .
the underlying correlator is < t  (p)t (p) >, here multiplied by h h and keeping track
of the four factors of momentum in the < t t > numerator. however, this counting is true only
if we expand (7), we see that all dressings of the
to leading, here quadratic, order in h .
curvatures in powers of h, keeping the at space 1
2 , maintain the p2 overall behavior, as they
should diagrammatically since this is still a 2-point function.
instead, even in d=2, if we also
expand 1

2 , about at space

 [0 + h ]1 = 1

1
2
h  g g   = (h  1

2  h) + ...

0 (1  1

0 h +...), 0   

(8)

there are increasing powers of p2, in total agreement with the diagrammatics: a 3-point closed loop
generically acquires another p2 from the extra propagator and so on for the n-point expansion.
indeed, although it seems to be folklore that anomalies must have only a 1
0 nonlocality, this is
only the case for the leading term. this fact will be essential in d=4. despite these higher poles,
the d=2 action is derivable by integrating out a perfectly physical ghostfree compensator elds

action, i2[] = r d2x[ 1

2 2 + e2]; this will no longer hold in higher dimension.

3 type a, d4

as shown in [1] there is a unique generalization of the d=2 anomaly to any d=2n, namely the
same infrared type is given by the euler density at d=2n,

a2n = e2n  (g)1/21..2n1..2n

r1...rn ,

(9)

where e2n vanishes identically in lower d (since the levicivita symbol does). then integrability
is always satised because e2n weyl transforms as
e2n(x)  g

2n dd(x)

(10)

where g
2n is an identically conserved tensor (as it must be, since e2n and its variations are total
divergences). for concreteness we will work specically in d=4, then indicate the generalization
to arbitrary d. here, g
is of course the einstein tensor (that indeed vanishes at d=2), hence it
follows directly from (9) that

4

e2n(x)/(x) = g

2n (x)dd (x  x) =  e2n(x)/(x) .

(11)

it is therefore tempting to write the same action as in d=2, in terms of the suitable generalization
indeed,

4 of 2. just by constant scale invariance, this must start as 4  g(2 + ..).

3

the precise form of 4 (acting on a scalar) was discovered by paneitz [3] and itself generalizes to
arbitrary d = 2n:

4 = g(2 + 2d(r  1

3 g r)d) ;

(12)

(13)

(14)

it is self-adjoint and reduces to 2
polyakov action due to riegert [2] is correct. actually, e4  e4 + 2
as in d=2
( e4/4) =  ,

 e4 = 4 ,

4 = 0

0 at at space. so it appears as if the natural extension of the

3 g r rather than e4 varies

the last two equations being valid only when 4 acts on scalars. hence the desired extension of (7)
is

i a

4 = z d4xg e41

4 ( e4/g ) , i a

4 / = e4

where we have rewritten the action of [2], as we did for d=2 in (7b) to make 1
( e4/g).

it is not quite obvious yet that (14) with its funny gs does vary correctly, but,
4 r d4x r2g / = g r, we see that since (14) varies into e4, it eectively

as we show below, it does. if we recall that r itself derives from a local (and hence irrelevant,
removable) term,  1
also varies into e4.

4 act on the scalar

0 pole, incompatible with the 3-point function r hhhht t ti,  r d4p

in [1] and elsewhere, (14) was criticized on the seemingly correct grounds that (through 1
4 )
it had a 2
(p2)3 (r3)  r r3/0
just by momentum counting around loops with three external curvatures, i.e., the leading o(h3
 )
term had to be 1
0 , nonlocal. the dimensional argument is correct, but the objection
was based on insisting that the o(h3
 ) part of the action be manifest linearized gauge invariant:
everything had to be stated in terms of curvatures. to understand the resulting paradox, rst
simply expand (14) in h :

0 , and not 2

4 [h3] = z d4x(e4 + 2
i a

3

0r)2

0  (1  2

0 (r  1

3  r) +...)(e4 + 2

3

0r) .

(15)

here all curvatures are needed only to their linearized o(h) order and all derivatives are also at
space ones; all corrections to those quantities either lead to o(h4) or are o(h3) but harmless,  1
0 .
next, get rid of the unity part of the 1
expansion: the quadratic terms are the local r d4x r2, the
4
cubics are  r d4x[e41
0 r] where 1 is the o(h) part of ; they are single-pole. now
pass to the correction term which seems to have a 4
0 . however, being linear, it only multiplies the
quadratic (0r)2
0 at worst. before proceeding further, note two important
0
features of cubic integrals: rst, the position of 1
among the 3 factors is irrelevant; second,
0
integration by parts rules are very useful, e.g., (for any s) r d4x s rr =  1
2 r d4x s0r2.

both are used implicitly below. the dangerous cubic terms in (15) are then of the form

0r  r2, so it is 2

0 r + 1r1

dependent one,

3  r) r .

0 (r  1
2 r r3/0 is obviously safe. this leaves the rst, r -

z d4x r 2
0 r =  1
0 (r )r = z d4xr,r, 2

the pure r3 part,  r r,r,2
z d4xr2
0 as it stands. note that there is no dimensional contradiction: the extra
is compensated for by the extra  in the numerator, but these are not mutable into a 0

which is certainly  2
1
0

0 r ,

(17)

(16)

by parts integration as long as we write everything in terms of curvatures alone. this seeming
impasse disappears by relaxing the latter requirement and expressing the ricci tensor in terms of
its metric denition,

2r = 0h  (2

h

 + ()) + h

, .

(18)

the 0h term is manifestly  1
integration by parts. the result of a simple calculation yields the equality

0 ; the remaining ones also provide an additional 0, after

z d4x r,r, 2

0 r = 1

2 r d4xhr,r,h /0  1

4 r2h

 + 1

2 r3/0i .

(19)

whose right side, although its rst term is irreducible to curvatures/0 is of course just as gauge-
invariant under h =  +  , r = 0 as the left.

this demonstrates the single pole nature of riegerts action to o(h3), which is all that can be
demanded of it. thereafter, there will clearly appear higher and higher poles in the h -expansion
of 1
4 . indeed, as explained previously, each successive additional vertex insertion into the loop
diagram involves an extra propagator and so, generically an (acceptable) extra power of 1
0 .
for higher d, the 2n will go as n, but again the leading, (n + 1)-point function must go as
r (d2np)/(p2)n+1  p2, and it will, by similar considerations as for d=4, with

ia = z d2nx e2n1

2n

e2n

(20)

and 2n  n + .. , e2n  e2n + ... where the additional terms in n and e2n are of lower/higher
derivative order respectively, and with ( e/) =  as in d=2,4.

to keep these results in perspective, one must remember that existence of an action which
varies correctly is almost tautological since its leading, o(h3), part is obtained (in d=4, say)
from the 3-point loop ht t ti by contracting it with three metrics; it thereby also has the correct
derivative dimensions. hence any action that varies correctly into the anomaly will have the right
dimensions as well. the new considerations here really make explicit rst that (7) (as we will see
from its second incarnation (7b)) indeed varies into the anomaly and second that it does embody
(albeit in hidden form) the lowest order (and permitted higher order) pole behavior dictated by
those dimensional properties. it is also clear that while (7) or (20) can be obtained by integrating
out local qft actions, the latter necessarily have ghost eld kinematics for d>2:

icov[] = z d2nx[ 1

2 2n +  e2n] ,

(21a)

0 . even the leading, o(h3), 1/0 terms cannot be obtained
since 2n here really does start as n
from a nonghost scalar action for d>2, simply by dimensions. consider for d=4, the general form

i3[] = z d4x[ 1

2 (0 + 1 + ar) + z] ,

(21b)

here the scalar z would obviously have to be of derivative dimension 3; quite apart from any details,
no scalar z (nor a vector action conserved source z ) can embody this. one could introduce
z  r3/2 terms, but even with this nonpolynomial ansatz it does not seem feasible to get the
desired o(h3) action. [as mentioned, the natural compensator eld action contains [2, 6] ()4
terms.]

4 type b, d4

the type b anomaly, which was in fact the rst one discovered in d=4 [5], has no d=2 antecedents
at all. its hallmarks are that the anomaly itself is weyl invariant,

and that the action depends on the uv cuto in a logarithmic way. there is only one ab in d=4,
but their number rises rapidly with dimension, e.g., there are 3 varieties at d=6. for d=4,

ab(x)/(x)  0

(22)

ab  g tr c 2 ,
the invariance of ab follows from the fact that c 

ab/  0 ;
 is the conformal-invariant index location
of the weyl tensor. the required logarithmic behavior was rst approximated in [5] by the lowest
order action

(23)

i 4

b  z d4xg tr c ln(/2)c + o(h4)

(24)

with  taken to o(h). from (8), this is plainly not quite correct, but certainly reproduces some
of the characteristics, including the dimensional cuto dependence. what we really want of course
is an argument  in the logarithm that varies as  /  = , while being simultaneously a scalar
(densities cannot be argument of logs by covariance) and of dimension 4, to bring in a 4. what
is the appropriate compensator ? ones immediate reaction is that  = 4/g, since
ln(4/g 4) fullls all requirements, but again only when acting on a scalar.
of  is merely to legally bring in ln g as the compensator, as well as display the need for a

cuto!] however, to keep 4 acting on scalars only would mean writing

[indeed the role

i 4

(25)

which seems supercially to vary correctly; unfortunately, i 4
vanishing variation.

b is really a total divergence, with

let us dispose of one other candidate action, based on the type a construction, that appears
to yield ab exactly except for the fact that it does not reect the ln 4/4 behavior required in
type b i.e., has wrong dimension. it is an instructive lesson, therefore, that it also thereby does not
weyl-vary correctly, best seen through the ne point that distinguished (7a) from (7b) earlier: the
type a action is based on the fact that e/ varies into  itself, so one might think that an action
b  r d4x( e4/4)g c 2 is the most economical way to achieve  i/ = g c 2.
of the form i 4
however, we must take into account the requirement that 4 act on a scalar in order to be invariant,
here on c 2 rather than on the density (gc 2), rewriting i 4
b = r d4xg( e4/4)(gc 2/g ).
but in this form there are two extra contributions to the variation, one each from the left g and
the right 1/g:
(26)
which do not vanish, unlike for type a, where we had the symmetric e41
e4 and hence the
corresponding extra term, ( e1 e  e1 e), vanishes when varying (20). the above wrong
construction, however, is useful in exhibiting the existence of a nonlocal weyl invariant, and hence
the formal non-uniqueness, but beyond leading h -order, of our eective actions: it is easy to
verify the weyl invariance of

b/ = g c 2 + ( e41
 i 4

4 c 2  c 21

e4),

4

4

iin v = z d4xg (g c 2)1

4 c 2 ;

(27)

6

the second term in the equivalent of (26) vanishes as both factors are identical. more generally,
nonlocal conformal (and dieo-)invariants can only begin at next-lowest, o(hn+2), in d=2n. in
this sense our explicit covariant actions, which start at o(hn+1), are unique: any others dier from
them by invariants that begin beyond the leading o(hn+1) terms.

finally let us turn to the desired all-order i 4

b. what makes it expressible in closed form is
the existence [6] of a covariant 4th derivative order tensor density operator c
4, any power of which,
when acting on a 4-tensor (but non-density!) with the algebraic properties of the weyl tensor,
remains invariant: (c

5 discussion

we have provided dieomorphism invariant eective actions for both type a and b anomalies in
closed form at all d4, and shown that they were also in accord with their underlying loop origins.
for type a, this meant reconsideration of the riegert action [2] to show that  despite initial
appearances  it both varied correctly (when the proper density factors were inserted) and (as had
to be) respected the single pole requirement to (and only to) lowest order about at space when
expanded in metric form. for type b, the existence of weyl invariant tensor density operators c
2n
acting on tensors with the algebraic properties of the weyl tensor (just like the simpler 2n were
weyl invariant when acting on scalars) enabled us to provide closed form actions compatible with
the log(/2)n behavior dictated by the diagrams; candidate actions behaving dierently varied

7

unacceptably. construction of a nonlocal weyl-invariant, starting at o(hn+2), showed our actions
nonuniqueness, at least without imposing further constraints. however, despite their closed form
nature, the physical meaning of these actions is still not suciently clear. for type a especially, we
saw that in contrast to the d=2 case, there is no physically acceptable local action which yields ours
upon integrating out a compensating eld. this seems to be true not merely of the full covariant
forms but already for the unique o(hn+1), 1
0 , leading terms near at space. needless to say, we
know still less about any such underlying basis for the type b action, with its logarithmic form.
given the continuing interest in conformal anomalies (for very recent very examples see e.g., [7, 8]),
a better understanding seems worth pursuing.
