broken somewhere planck weak scale. another approach one might contemplate start already non-supersymmetric string theory planck scale. however, generically non-supersymmetric string theories plagued problems luckily absent supersymmetric string theories. bosonic string theory, non-supersymmetric theories tachyons appear, best imaginable scenarios indicate phase transition stable background. moreover, without supersymmetry big cosmological constant generated loop corrections conict small value cosmological constant observe least universe. non-supersymmetric string theories vanishing

moduli usually generated, must stabilized, well. concerning establishing string dualities, one also less solid ground compared supersymmetric string theories. particular, notion bps like objects masses receive quantum corrections. paper mainly deal rst problems mentioned above, namely construct non-supersymmetric models free tachyonic modes. concretely consider special orientifolds type 0b
