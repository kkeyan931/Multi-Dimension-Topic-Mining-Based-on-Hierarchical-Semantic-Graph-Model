abstract

we consider type iib (p, q) 5-branes in constant non-zero background tensor po-
tentials, or equivalently, with nite constant eld strength on the brane. at linear
level, zero-modes are introduced and the physical degrees of freedom are found
to be parametrised by a real 2- or 4-form eld strength on the brane. an exact,
sl(2;z)-covariant solution to the full non-linear supergravity equations is then con-
structed. the resulting metric space-times are analysed, with special emphasis on
the limiting cases with maximal values of the tensor. the analysis provides an an-
swer to how the various background tensor elds are related to borninfeld degrees
of freedom and to non-commutativity parameters.

1. introduction

in investigating the structure of m/string theory, various extended non-perturbative objects,
branes, have proved to be very important []. these objects arise as solitonic solutions to
the low-energy eective theories [,], i.e., supergravities in eleven or ten dimensions. the
physical degrees of freedom of the branes arise as zero-modes around the solitonic solutions
[,] in analogy with the ordinary monopole case [] (see however ref. [] for some important
dierences due to whether the theory contains gravity or not). in a previous paper [], we
generalised the goldstone prescription for generating zero-modes to the case of tensor elds.
this enabled us to treat all zero-modes on an equal footing and also showed us exactly where
the zero-modes sit in the target space elds. in ref. [] we continued to explore the zero-modes
beyond linear level and were able to nd exact solutions to the full non-linear supergravity
equations for the d3 and m5 branes with nite constant eld strength, or, equivalently, in
the background of a constant tensor potential. this paper is the natural continuation of this
work as we now turn to the more dicult case of type iib (p, q) 5-branes.

in contrast to the d3 and m5 brane cases [], where we a priori had strong reasons
to expect analytic solutions, we now have the additional complication of a real 4-form eld
strength on the brane, which could make things worse []. in addition, the object used to
parametrise the zero-modes, a real 2- or 4-form, does not have any duality property as in
the previous d3 and m5 brane cases. this means that the ansatz for the nite solution will
contain more terms and that the algebra will be much more involved.

in section 2, we will review some properties of type iib supergravity that we will use and
also write down the ns 5-brane solution, which will be our starting point. the zero-mode
solution, which gives the parametrisation of the zero-modes, is obtained in section 3. in
section 4, we solve the full non-linear supergravity equations and in section 5 we analyse the
resulting metric space-times. we end by discussing the obtained solution and some possible
implications.

2. preliminaries

the type iib supergravity in ten dimensions has an sl(2;r) invariance (which is broken
to sl(2;z) by quantum eects) and contains two scalars in the coset space sl(2;r)/u(1)
(the dilaton  and the axion ), a selfdual 5-form eld strength h(5), which is an sl(2;r)
singlet, and a real sl(2;r) doublet of 3-form eld strengths h(3)r = dc(2)r (r = 1, 2),
corresponding to the ns-ns and r-r eld strengths respectively. however, there exists a
formulation, which makes the sl(2;r) covariance manifest []. we will use the notation of
refs. [,]. the scalars are described by a complex doublet, u r, which obey the following

sl(2;r)-invariant constraint

i

2 rsu r u s = 1

(.)

(we use conventions where 12 = 1, 12 = 1). gauging the u(1) leaves two physical scalars
which can be obtained through the projective invariant  = u 1/ u 2 =  + i e. one
advantage of the covariant formulation is that the doublet of scalars transforms in a simple
way under sl(2;r), whereas the physical scalars transform in a more complicated way via
the projective invariant  . the left-invariant sl(2;r) maurercartan 1-forms are

q = 1

2 rsdu r u s ,

p = 1

2 rsdu ru s .

(.)

under the local u(1) transformation u r  u rei (where the u(1) charge is normalised to
1 for the scalar doublet), the 1-forms transform as q  q + d , p  p e2i, i.e., q is a
u(1) gauge eld and p has u(1) charge 2. the maurercartan equations are

dp = 0 ,

dq  ip  p = 0 ,

(.)

where the covariant derivative d = d  ieq acts from the right (although fermions are not
treated in this paper, we stick to standard superspace conventions), and e is the u(1) charge.
the contravariant doublet of scalars can be combined with a covariant doublet to yield an
sl(2;r)-invariant object. the doublet can of course be retrieved from the scalar doublet
and the sl(2;r)-invariant object, e.g.,

h(3)  u rh(3)r ,

h(3)r = rs im(u s h(3)) .

(.)

using this formalism, the equations of motion can be written as

dp + i h(3)h(3) = 0 ,
dh(3)  i  h(3) p  4 i h(5)h(3) = 0 ,

and the bianchi identities are

dh(3) + i h(3)p = 0 ,
dh(5)  i

h(3)  h(3) = 0 .

 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . cederwall, gran, nielsen, nilsson: (p,q) 5-branes in non-zero b-field

in type iib we have an ns 5-brane, which couples magnetically to c(2)1 and a d5-brane,
which couples magnetically to c(2)2 (these are of course not the only tensor couplingsany
(p, q) 5-brane couples to all tensors in type iib supergravity, as can be seen from the known d-
brane actions []). here we conventionally denote the charge doublet (p, q), in the covariant
formalism this becomes pr (r=1,2), and for a classical 5-brane these are just real numbers.
due to the existence of (p, q) strings [], the charges will be quantised and for the quantum
mechanically allowed 5-branes, pr will be integers. the ns 5-brane corresponds to the charges
(1,0) and the d5-brane to (0,1). the physical charges are obtained by multiplying with the
5-brane charge quantum . apart from the charge, the ns 5-brane solution is characterised
by the asymptotic value . in the complex formalism, the solution for asymptotically
vanishing dilaton and axion (i.e.,  = i) is

ds2 = 1/4dx2 + 3/4dy2 ,
h 0

2 1 y d ,

(3) =  i

4 1d ,
p = i
u 1 = i 1/4 ,

h(5) = 0 ,

q = 0 ,
u 2 = 1/4 ,

(.)

where  = 1 + /2,  being the radial distance to the brane, and x,y means dualisation
with respect to the longitudinal (x) or the transverse (y) space. one advantage of the complex
formalism is that the above expressions for the metric, the 3-form and the 1-forms contain
all the (p, q) 5-branes. the point is that we have doublets u r and h(3)r which transform
under sl(2;r) as u r  m r
rh(3)s, where m is an sl(2;r) matrix.
when contracting the indices, we obtain an sl(2;r)-invariant object. hence the 3-form h(3)
is the same for the ns 5-brane and the (p, q) 5-branes, as long as the background scalars are
transformed along with the charges. if we want a specic type of brane, we can start with
the ns 5-brane and then simultaneously make an sl(2;z) transformation on the scalar and
3-form doublets.

su s, h(3)r  (m 1)s

the general version of eq. (.) for arbitrary charge (p, q) and arbitrary background

scalars is formally identical to (.) except for

u r = rs(cid:0)k1/4ps + ik11/4 ps(cid:1) ,

(.)

where rspr ps = 1 (pr does not have to be integer) and k is real, and where  = 1+k1/2.
notice that k1 = |u r
pr|, so the expression for  agrees with the one found in ref. [].
the asymptotic value of the physical scalar is  = (kq  ik1 q)/(kp  ik1 p). most of the
explicit calculations will, for the sake of economy of notation, make use of the ns 5-brane
charge (p, q) = (1, 0) and  = i, although the results will be stated in sl(2;z)-covariant
form.

3. zero-mode solution

we start by analysing the zero-modes using the general goldstone prescription introduced in
ref. []. this analysis will tell us how the zero-modes are parametrised, in our case by a real
2- or 4-form in the longitudinal directions, and enable us to write down an ansatz for the
exact solution. from the zero-mode solution we will also see exactly where the zero-modes
sit in the target space elds.

as described in e.g. ref. [], physical modes correspond to broken large gauge transfor-
mations. by a large gauge transformation we mean a transformation that does not go to
zero at spatial innity and therefore will change the charges associated with an object. if e.g.
a large gauge transformation changes the momentum of an object we must conclude that
the transformation corresponds to a time-dependent translation. in this sense, large gauge
transformations are equivalent to global symmetries of the theory. by taking the equations
of motion into account, as we will see later, we can determine the transversal dependence
of the zero-modes and thus single out a particular large gauge transformation which corre-
sponds to a global symmetry. we then have the ordinary correspondence between broken
global symmetries and physical modes.

small gauge transformations, i.e., transformations that go to zero at spatial innity,
on the other hand, relate equivalent congurations and therefore have nothing to do with
global symmetries or zero-modes. they only represent a redundancy in our description of
the theory.

it is important to note that since we are considering a theory with gravity, i.e., with
reparametrisation invariance, in contrast to the ordinary monopole case, we must be careful
when we talk about e.g. translations. to actually change the brane conguration we must
do something that is more than a small gauge transformation and therefore have a non-
vanishing eect at innity. what we really mean by a translation in a theory with gravity
is a large reparametrisation, and instead of saying that broken translational invariance gives
rise to scalar modes on the brane we should say that the scalar modes arise by breaking the
large reparametrisation invariance in the transverse directions []. since we actually consider
a theory with supergravity, the same arguing applies for the supersymmetry transformations
[].

we now introduce the tensor zero-modes as described in ref. [], by making a gauge
transformation c(2)r = d(1)r. using the proposed mechanism to generate zero-modes
as large gauge transformations, we make an ansatz u r(1)r = rea(1)kr + i ima(1)ki ,
where a(1) = u ra(1)r is a complex 1-form potential which lies in the longitudinal directions
and a(1)r is constant. that the correct thing to do is to allow dierent radial behaviour for
the real and imaginary parts is understood from the background values of u r. the reason
why we take a(1) to lie in the longitudinal directions is of course that we want to be able
to integrate out the transversal dependence, thus obtaining an eective theory on the brane

 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . cederwall, gran, nielsen, nilsson: (p,q) 5-branes in non-zero b-field

world-volume. we get

c(2) = rea(1) dkr + i ima(1) dki .

(.)

we now let a(1)r become x-dependent, which means that (.) is no longer a pure gauge
transformation. by computing h(3) and solving the equations of motion for the variation
we will get the equations of motion and the transversal behaviour of the zero-modes. we
nd (this relies on the observation that the scalars do not transform at linear levelthis
may be deduced group-theoretically or a posteriori from the solution)

h(3) = u rd(c(2)r) = ref(2) dkr  i imf(2) dki ,

(.)

where f(2) = u rf(2)r = u rda(1)r is the complex eld strength on the brane. (since type
iib theory contains a doublet of 2-form potentials any sl(2;z)-covariant description of a
brane must contain a doublet of vector potentials. how the complex eld strength is related
to the born-infeld eld strength will be claried below.) when solving the equations of
motion it is convenient to have all the -dependence explicit and we therefore introduce
(2), which is a -independent complex 2-form when expressed in lorentz indices, i.e., when
f
we use the vielbeins to go from coordinate-frame to lorentz indices. in the next section we
need to introduce higher matrix powers of f
(2). using lorentz indices, we then avoid the
complexity of metric factors.

we then have

h(3) = ref

(2) dkr  i imf

(2) dki 1/2 ,

(.)

where we have taken the  factors coming from the vielbeins and from the u s into account.

we also have to introduce zero-modes in h(5). this will be clear by looking at the
result, but can be understood by the fact that not only strings but also 3-branes may end on
5-branes, the two types of couplings being related by what will manifest itself as a duality
relation. here, a slight complication is present. the bianchi identity for the 5-form is readily
solved by

which is invariant under

h(5) = dc(4) + 1

2 im(c(2)  h(3)) ,

c(4) = d(3) + 1

2 im((1)ru r  h(3)) .

(.)

(.)

the variation of c(2)r introduced in eq. (.) clearly aects h(5), in such a way, however,
that the new 5-form eld strength is not single-valued on the transverse 3-sphere (remember

cederwall, gran, nielsen, nilsson: (p,q) 5-branes in non-zero b-field . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

that the background value of c(2)r is such that h(3)r wrap the sphere with charges (p, q)).
in order to use eq. (.) in a consistent way, i.e., in order to work with transformations at
the level of gauge potentials, two things have to be achieved by the 3-form gauge parameter
(3). it must generate a large gauge transformation, and it must, when made x-dependent,
cancel the otherwise inconsistent non-uniqueness in h(5). to be precise, the term we must
include in (3), in addition to the zero-modes, is

1

2 im(c(2) (1)ru r) ,

(.)

where c(2) is the background value of the potential and the x-dependence of (1)r is, as usual,
turned on when the variation of c(4) is obtained. in the present case, where the background
eld strengths are purely transversal, the eect of this is that the modication terms in
h(5) as well as in c(4) are discarded, and one may formally proceed as if h(5) = dc(4).
would there have been longitudinal components of background eld strengths, one had been
led to consider modied eld strengths also in brane directions, as in ref. [].

we thus make a gauge variation c(4) = d(3), where h(5) = dc(4). using the ansatz
(3) = ka(3), where a(3) is a constant 3-form potential in the longitudinal directions,
yields

by letting a(3) become x-dependent we obtain

c(4) = dk a(3) .

h(5) = dk g(4)  ydk xg(4) ,

(.)

(.)

where g(4) = da(3) and we have taken the requirement that h(5) must be self-dual into
account. to make the -dependence explicit we introduce g(4), which is -independent
when expressed in lorentz indices,

h(5) = dk1/2 g(4)  ydk1/2 xg(4) ,

(.)

where  means dualisation with respect to the at metric.

by inserting the variations into the second bianchi identity in (.) we get

d x g(4) = 0 ,

(.)

which is the equation of motion for g(4). we also get a relation between g(4) and f

(2).

4 . the lhs of the rst equation in (.)

since a bps brane in d = 10 has eight fermionic degrees of freedom, we must have eight
bosonic degrees of freedom in order to have supersymmetry. the scalar elds contribute with
four bosonic degrees of freedom for a 5-brane and we must get the remaining four from the
tensor zero-modes. at rst, it seems like we get too many from the tensor modes, since a
complex 2-form eld strength in six dimensions has eight degrees of freedom, i.e., twice the
amount we wanted. we, however, require the zero-modes to be normalisable, which singles
out kr =  3
4 and ki = 0, i.e., the imaginary part of h(3) vanishes. we have thus found
(2), which gives
that the zero-modes are parametrised by a real 2-form eld strength, ref
us the correct number of degrees of freedom.

we would like to comment in a more detailed way on the relation between the eld
strength on the brane and the background tensor potential. for an innitesimally thin
brane embedded in a target space, the equivalence is a consequence of the gauge invariance
of f  b = da  b. in the context of a soliton solution, the brane is the entire eld
conguration between the horizon and minkowski innity, and the background elds are the
values of the elds at innity. here we do not have f and b as independent objects, rather
the behaviour of b is parametrised in terms of f . take e.g. the linearised solution of the
present section. for a constant ref
(2) we may write the (interesting part of the) 3-form eld
(2)3/4]. note that the potential inside the square brackets
strength as h(3) = d [ref
goes to zero when  goes to zero (at the horizon) and to a nite background value when
 goes to innity. the conguration is that of an ns 5-brane in a constant (longitudinal)
2-form background. this was demonstrated here at linear level, but of course continues to
hold to all orders for the solutions presented in the following section.

in a type iib theory, we are generically in a situation where there are several tensor
potentials coupling to a brane. an important piece of information is the identication of the
combination of tensor potentials that are related to the borninfeld degrees of freedom, and
to the non-commutativity parameter. the parametrisation of the zero-modes, and later of
the full solutions, in terms of a real 2-form provides exactly this information.

4. finite field strength solution

the excitation of the 3-form is parametrised by the -independent 2-form f  ref
(2),
introduced in the previous section. the goldstone analysis yields zero-modes which are linear

cederwall, gran, nielsen, nilsson: (p,q) 5-branes in non-zero b-field . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

in f , i.e., the analysis is only valid for small eld strength. finite constant eld strength can
be obtained by doing an expansion in f . however, we can truncate the expansion because of
the caleyhamilton relation, which for antisymmetric matrices in 6-dimensional minkowski
space takes the form

f 6 = 1

2 t2f 4 + ( 1

4 t4  1

8 t2

2) f 2 + det(f )  ,

(.)

where t2 = tr(f 2), t4 = tr(f 4) and  is the diagonal matrix corresponding to the minkowski
metric (, +, . . . , +).

for the sake of simplicity, we start out with an ns 5-brane in  = i. the general case
is kept under control as in section , and the sl(2;z)-covariant result will be stated at the
end. the charges are determined by the real doublet of 3-forms h(3)r. once we excite the
3-form we must also excite the 1-form p and the 5-form to get solutions to the equations of
motion. since p is excited, the scalars will change. to stay on the (1,0) brane, we need to
change the complex background 3-form h 0
(3)r (background here meant in the
sense f = 0, not to be confused with asymptotic values).

(3) = u rh 0

we work in the gauge im(u 2) = 0, corresponding to

u 1 = e/2 + i e/2 , u 2 = e/2 ,

(.)

which forces us to have a non-vanishing u(1) gauge eld (see the comment at the end of
the section). writing ds2 = gdxdx + gpqdypdyq, the longitudinal metric g will get
f 2, f 4 and t2, t4, det(f ) corrections, whereas the transverse metric gpq  c2 pq, just gets
t2, t4, det(f ) corrections, since f lies in the longitudinal directions. it is convenient to work
with the matrix a, dened from the vielbein as a  log e (where e means ei
). it is easy to
get the metric from a. from the structure of the einstein equations we get c = exp(tr(a)),
and the ricci tensor now takes the simple form

rpq = pq(cid:0)tr(a2) + 1
r = c2()2e
ij ,

ie

2 (tra)2(cid:1) + 1

where prime indicates dierentiation with respect to .

the coordinate dependence of the solution can be written in terms of , and the ansatz

thus takes the form

a = a0  + a2 f 2 + a4 f 4 ,

h(3) = h y d  f2 d ,

h(5) = g(2) yd  dxg(2) ,

p = p d

and we have chosen to write the 5-form in terms of the 2-form

g(2) =   g(4) .

(.)

(.)

it is a straight-forward group-theoretical excercise to convince oneself that no other inde-
pendent combinations of f s can enter the ansatz. q is pure gauge, since the form of p
yields dq = 0. the maurercartan equations are therefore automatically satised. here
p, q, h, f1, f3 and f5 are complex functions of , t2, t4 and det(f ), and a0, a2, a4, g1, g3 and
g5 are real functions of the same variables and parameters. the functions p and q should of
course not be confused with the sl(2;z) charges (p, q).

inserting the ansatz in the equations of motion and bianchi identities yields equations

for these functions, see appendix a. the background solution corresponds to

a0 =  1

8 log  ,

p = i

4 1 ,

h =  i

2 1 ,

(.)

and the rest zero. the rst-order correction is the zero-mode solution found in the previ-
ous section, f1, g1  3/2, where the -dependence of the vielbeins has been taken into
account. now we can solve the equations order by order and the result is expansions in
negative powers of , see appendix a. because of the complexity of the equations and the
ansatz, we made a mathematica program to get the expansion of the solution. we were
able to sum up these series and we have checked the result explicitly for the p equation of
motion. the solution can be written in terms of the following functions:

f2+   + 9
f2    9
f4  2 + ( 9
fdet  f2+f4  ( 27

16 t2 ,
16 t2 ,
16 )2 (cid:0)(t2)2  4 t4(cid:1) ,

8 )2 det(f ) .

(.)

only the rst four terms in the expansions were used to determine the solution. for half of
the functions in the ansatz we have calculated 8-9 more terms and for the other half 21-22
more terms, and they all agree with the solution written in closed form. we therefore feel
condent that the solution is indeed the exact one.

cederwall, gran, nielsen, nilsson: (p,q) 5-branes in non-zero b-field . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

we converted the expansions for a0, a2 and a4 to expansions for the metric with the

following exact result

g = (fdet)3/4f4  + 9

4 (fdet)3/4f2(f 2) + ( 9

(.)

the above solution for the metric, the 5-form, the 3-form and the 1-forms constitutes the
sl(2;z)-covariant part of the solution and is therefore valid for all (p, q) 5-branes. the only
remaining information lies in the background value of the scalars. for instance, the ns
5-brane with  = i has

8 pf(f ) (f4)1 ,
 = 27
e = (fdet)1/2(f4)1 ,

which in our choice of gauge corresponds to the scalar doublet

u 1 = (fdet)1/4(f4)1/2(cid:0) 27
u 2 = (fdet)1/4(f4)1/2 .

it is straightforward to get the doublet of 3-forms from h(3) and the scalar doublet. as
explained in section , a (p, q) 5-brane can be obtained by simultaneously making sl(2;z)
transformations on these two doublets. then we of course just get the 5-branes obtained as

the sl(2;z) orbit on  = i. for the solution with general charges and arbitrary background

scalars, the scalar doublet is the nite eld strength modication of (.), leading to the

covariant expression

u r = rs (cid:16)k1 ps (fdet)1/4 (f4)1/2(cid:0) 27

8 pf(f ) (fdet)1/2 + i(cid:1) kps (fdet)1/4 (f4)1/2(cid:17) . (.)

with the covariant gauge choice discussed below, we thus have an sl(2;z)-covariant solution.

to linear order the exact solution reduces to the zero-mode solution found in section .

for all the elds, except the 3-form on the brane, it can easily be checked that we obtain

the background ns 5-brane solution by setting f and the parameters depending on f to

zero. for the 3-form on the brane we have to be more careful, since we divide by the pfaan

in the imaginary parts. if we choose a certain basis for f , see the next section, and insert
f1, f3 and f5 into f(2), it can be seen that f(2) will indeed vanish when f does.

a comment on u(1) gauge choices: the solutions for vanishing eld strength, given in

eqs. (.) and (.), use q = 0 as a choice of gauge for the local u(1) symmetry. this gauge

choice has the advantage of being manifestly sl(2;z)-invariant. in the case of an ns5-brane,
it is equivalent to im(u 2) = 0. the reason for our departure from q = 0 when the tensor
is turned on is purely practical. the eld conguration is always such that p points in

the radial direction, which means that q is closed, dq = 0, and it is formally trivial to

perform a gauge transformation to reach q = 0. the diculty we encounter for nite eld

strength is that even though we have an explicit expression for q, eq. (.), we have not
been able to integrate it to a closed analytic expression. the gauge choice im(u 2) = 0 is
therefore better suited to our ambition of giving closed explicit solutions for all elds. it

is not sl(2;z)-covariant as it stands, but can easily be made so with the introduction of
general chargesit then reads im(u r pr) = 0. the general solution (.) clearly fullls this
equation.

5. properties of the metric

in this section we analyse the metric arising from the deformation of the 5-brane via the nite

constant eld strength. to get a solution which makes sense, we must impose a condition

on the parameters of this eld strength.

this is dened in minkowski space and therefore we get a sign change in t2 compared to the

in this basis, the metric in the brane directions will be diagonal, since f 2 and f 4 are diagonal.
furthermore, from the structure of f , we get a natural split into three two-dimensional
spaces, one minkowskian and two euclidean. the components of the metric in the subspaces
are

g11 = (fdet)3/4(cid:16)( + 9

besides from the advantage of having a diagonal metric, one also has detailed knowledge
about f . when all the s are non-vanishing, the matrix has full rank, and lower rank can
be obtained by turning one or two of the parameters o. the exact solution found in the
previous section is of course simplied when using a lower rank matrix. if we for instance
set 2 and 3 to zero, everything can be expressed in terms of just two functions   9
8 1.
in the limit of vanishing 2-form eld strength, the longitudinal metric has the usual
asymptotic minkowski form (, +, +, +, +, +). for nite eld strength, the metric should
still asymptotically be minkowski, i.e., the rst component should be negative and the rest
should be positive. this gives a restriction on the  parameters. because of the negative
power of fdet in the metric, in order to get a non-singular solution, the parameters should
fulll yet another restriction. this is related to the breakdown of borninfeld dynamics at

some nite eld strength. it turns out that the latter requirement is the stronger, and we
get

in ref. [], we calculated the nite tensor deformations of the d3 and the m5-branes. because
of the duality properties, the solutions just depend on one parameter , which also has an
upper bound. in the limiting case, the metric blows up asymptotically in some directions on
the brane and shrinks in the other directions. this was interpreted as smeared out strings or
3 = 8
membranes. here we get the same kind of behaviour in the limiting case 2
9 .
for almost every possibility (the exception is considered below), after trivial rescalings, the
leading asymptotic terms in the metric become

2 + 2

1 + 2

ds2 = 3/2dx2

1 + 1/2(dx2

2 + dx2

3 + dy2) ,

(.)

where dx2
i , i = 1, 2, 3, corresponds to the three two-dimensional subspaces on the brane. we
see that the metric in the two-dimensional minkowskian subspace blows up asymptotically,
whereas it shrinks in the other directions, and the result is a smeared out string. the
exception is when just 2 or 3 is dierent from zero. considering the latter, we get the
following asymptotical behaviour of the metric

ds2 =  (dx2

1 + dx2

2) + 1(dx2

3 + dy2) .

(.)

here four directions blow up and the rest shrink. this is interpreted as a smeared out
3-brane.

in summary, we saw in the previous section that f and its higher powers were used as a
basis, and the solution was described in terms of the traces and the determinant. using the
frame introduced in this section, various properties of the solution become more clear. the
metric becomes diagonal and we have seen that we get an upper bound on the parameters
of the nite constant eld strength.

6. discussion

we have constructed explicitly the type iib supergravity solutions corresponding to 5-branes
with arbitrary charges and with nite borninfeld eld strength, or equivalently, in a nite
background tensor eld. the solutions are considerably more involved than in the previously
treated cases of type iib 3-branes and m5-branes [], due to the fact that a (p, q) 5-brane
couples both to the ns-ns and rr 2-forms and to the chiral 4-form, which in the solutions
manifests itself as excitations of all these tensors.

cederwall, gran, nielsen, nilsson: (p,q) 5-branes in non-zero b-field . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

one of the main results of the paper is that it answers the question provoked by the
titlewhat is the b-eld that a (p, q) 5-brane feels? we have parametrised the physical
modes by a real 2-form, which identies the unique combination of the doublet of 2-forms
and the 4-form that can not be gauged away in the presence of a (p, q) 5-brane.

we envisage some potential applications of the result. the rst one, which was one of the
main reasons for initiating this work, concerns the sl(2;z)-covariant formulation of type iib
5-brane dynamics, continuing the work of refs. [,] for lower-dimensional type iib branes.
related issues have been addressed in a number of papers [,,,]. a straight-forward
poincare dualisation of the borninfeld action was rst attempted in ref. []. it is however
unclear how relevant such a procedure isthe borninfeld eld strength, being related to
the ns-ns 2-form, is not sl(2;z)-invariant and the dual can hardly be associated with
the sl(2;z)-invariant 4-form. in ref. [], it was claried how a duality relation between a
complex 2-form and a real 4-form will be a natural ingredient in the type of description
we are looking for. for all values of the radius, there will be a (radius-dependent) duality
relation. it is likely that this relation may be deduced using the results of the present paper.
the only obstacle could be that one encounters equations that do not have obvious analytic
solutions, as in ref. []. we nd it more likely, however, that this will happen when one tries
to solve for some tensors in terms of others. the attempt of ref. [] to dualise the born
infeld eld failed due to the occurrence of quintic equations. here, we also note that both the
2-form and 4-form eld strengths on the brane are explicitly parametrised by a real 2-form
(f ), which, in light of the surprisingly simple expression (.) for the 4-form (for which we
have no other explanation than that we were lucky in our choice of basis), means that the
complex 2-form f is easily expressed in terms of the 4-form g. the opposite, to express
g in terms of f would demand solving a quintic equation. an order-by-order solution of
the problem of nding an sl(2;z)-covariant action was attempted in ref. [], with partial
success.

it is well known that the borninfeld action (and similar actions, e.g. for chiral 2-forms
in d = 6) has a maximal nite eld strength where the generalisation of the volume element
containing det(g + f ) degenerates, and the canonical electric eld diverges. analogously,
there is a maximal value of the non-commutativity parameter in non-commutative maxwell
theory. the solutions presented here and in ref. [] go furtherthey investigate in which sense
10- or 11-dimensional space-time degenerates in this limit. the result is, maybe somewhat
surprisingly, that the limiting space-times are well-dened, but with an asymptotic structure
that diers radically from the asymptotically minkowski brane solutions. there is an eective
reduction of the dimensionality of the boundary (boundary understood in the same sense
as in ads space), corresponding to a lower-dimensional brane. in the present paper string
and 3-brane degeneracies were presented explicitly, which gives an even stronger indication
that the limiting cases in some not yet fully understood sense correspond to branes-within-
branes situations. it is conceivable that there is an ads/cft-like correspondence between
superstring theory on these spaces and eld theories on the (codimension > 1) boundaries.

finally, the solutions found here and in ref. [] should be relevant in connection to
non-commutative geometry []. it has already been stressed that a nite value of the brane
eld strength is identical to a situation with nite background b eld (due to the gauge
transformation b = d, a = , leaving the combination da  b invariant). the results of
this paper contain explicit information, presented in an sl(2;z)-covariant form, about where
among the various tensor elds in type iib supergravity the non-commutativity parameter
is to be found. the corresponding information for the 3-brane is found in ref. []. although
the full solution for the m5-brane is known, we do not know the generalisation of non-
commutativity relevant for (chiral) 2-forms, and in that sense the m5-brane is still concealing
some, probably very interesting and stringy, secrets. to our knowledge, non-commutative
eld theory has never been treated with the ambition of manifesting sl(2;z)this may
prove interesting for e.g. the 3-brane and 5-branes in type iib, and the present techniques
would undoubtedly be relevant. neither has any concrete understanding been obtained con-
cerning generalisations to higher rank tensors. maybe detailed knowledge of the target space
congurations of the type presented here and in ref. [] can be helpful.
