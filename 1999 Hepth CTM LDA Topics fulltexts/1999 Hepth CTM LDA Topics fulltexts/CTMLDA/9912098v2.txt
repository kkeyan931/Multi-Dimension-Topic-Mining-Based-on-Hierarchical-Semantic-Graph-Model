abstract

we present evidence that there is a 4d model that satises the con-
ditions of renormalizability and dieomorphism invariance simultaneously
at the 2-loop level. the traceless mode is treated perturbatively, while the
conformal mode can be managed exactly. the two conditions constrain the
theory strongly, and determine the measure of gravitational eld uniquely.
quantum corrections of the cosmological constant are computed up in part
to 3-loop diagrams. how to remove the negative-metric states is also dis-
cussed from the viewpoint of dieomorphism invariance in analogy to the
r gauge in spontaneously broken gauge theory. the model may be a can-
didate for a continuum version of 4d simplicial quantum geometry realized
in recent numerical simulations.

1 introduction

for a long time, many authors have been longing to construct a well-dened
4d quantum theory of gravity [1][16]. renormalizability is a big problem that we
must overcome. besides this, we have to make any theory to be dieomorphism
invariant. furthermore, there are physical problems like unitarity, or how to
dene the s-matrix in a fully uctuating geometry. as a rst step, it should be
claried whether there is a model that satises the two fundamental conditions
of renormalizability and dieomorphism invariance simultaneously. in this paper
we give evidence that the model proposed in the previous paper [16] just satises
the two conditions. the problem of the s-matrix and the unitarity in our model
is also discussed from the viewpoint of dieomorphism invariance at the end of
the paper.

on the other hand, there is a development in dynamical triangulation ap-
proach [17, 18, 19] to a 4-dimensional manifold [20, 21]. recent numerical sim-
ulations suggest that 4d simplicial quantum geometry with u(1) gauge elds is
likely to have a higher order phase transition than 1-st order [21]. naively, if
there is a continuum limit of 4d simplicial quantum geometry, it will satisfy the
conditions of renormalizability and dieomorphism invariance.

dieomorphism invariant quantum theory is formally dened by the func-

tional integration over the metric,

z = z [g1dg]g[df ]g

vol(di.)

exp[i(f, g)] ,

(1.1)

where f is a matter eld 2 and i is an invariant action. the measure of the metric
is dened by the norm,

< g, g >g= z ddxggg(gg + ugg) ,

(1.2)

where u > 1/d by positive deniteness of the norm.
before the middle 1980s, pertubation theory had been naively dened by re-
placing the covariant measure with the measure dened on the background-meric,
g, as [g1dg]g[df ]g. this replacement, however, breaks the background-metric in-
dependence, or dieomorphism invariance, which is nothing but an innitesimal
version of the former. the renormalizability is also related to the problem of the
measure. this problem was not able to be overcome even by going to supergrav-
ity. it has thus been believed that superstring theory [22] is a unique candidate
for a background-metric independent quantum theory of gravity [23].

at the end of the 1980s a new approach emerged. the theory was formulated
in such a way as to preserve background-metric independence, even after the
measure is re-expressed by one dened based on the background-metric. 2d

2in this paper all 2-nd order elds except gravitational eld are refered to matter elds.

quantum gravity was solved exactly by knizhnik, polyakov and zamolodchikov
(kpz) [24] and david, distler and kawai (ddk) [25] in this way; then, several
2d models, such as dilaton gravity [26, 27, 28] and r2-gravity [29], were studied.
the idea can apply to even-dimensional quantum gravity, which makes the theory
background-metric independent; to do this we must add an action, s, as [16, 26]

z = z [d]g[ehdeh]g[df ]g

vol(di.)

exp[s(, g)  i(f, g)] .

(1.3)

the metric is now decomposed as g = e2g and g = (geh), where tr(h) =
0, adopted by kawai, kitazawa and ninomiya [30] as well as by the author [16].
the measures of the metric elds are dened on the background-metric by the
norms:

< ,  >g= z ddxqg()2 ,
< h, h >g= z ddxqg tr(eheh)2 .

(1.4)

(1.5)

the action, s, is a contribution induced from the measures, and is related to the
conformal anomaly. note that an anomaly usually means a classical symmetry
breaks down at the quantum level, but now the anomalous contribution, s, is
rather needed to ensure dieomorphism invariance at the quantum level.

s must satisfy the wess-zumino condition [31] to realize background-metric
independence, or z(e2 geb) = z(g), referred to as the bmi condition in the
following, where  and b
, which satisfy tr(b) = 0, are local functions. since
the measure [ehdeh]g, itself, is invariant under the change eh  ebeh, the
bmi condition for the traceless mode stands for that g and h always appear
in the combination g = geh in the theory [16]. although it is a rather trivial
condition, it means that when we calculate s, we can guess the h-dependence if
the g dependence of s can be shown.

besides being background-metric independent, namely, invariant under gen-

eral coordinate transformations,

 =

1
d

 +  ,

d

g = g  + g  
g  ,
the theory (1.3) should also be renormalizable.
in 4 dimensions s is a 4-th
order function. in this paper we assert that the measure of a 4d gravitational
eld, including s and the 4-th order invariant action [5][12], will be uniquely
determined by the two conditions; thus the integrability condition discussed by
riegert, fradkin and tseytlin [32] would be satised. here, we emphasize that
the 4-th order terms are just required by dieomorphism invariance, but are by no

(1.6)

means introduced by hand only for renormalizability, as in previous studies [6]
[12].

this paper is organized as follows. in the next section, as an exercise before
going to 4d models, we briey review 2d quantum gravity from the viewpoint of
dieomorphism invariance. the kpz/ddk formula [24, 25] on spherical topology
is computed using dimensional regularization. in this model, many fundamental
thoughts are included. in section 3 we consider a 4d model proposed in a previous
paper [16], which is slightly modied here. in 4 dimensions the traceless mode as
well as the conformal mode become dynamical. perturbation theory is applied
to the traceless mode, where a dimensionless coupling constant, t, is introduced,
while the conformal mode can be managed exactly [30, 16]. a model studied by
antoniadis, mazur and mottola [13, 14, 15] as a fully eective theory of quantum
gravity essentially corresponds to our model at the limit t  0. in this section
we present evidence that our model is renormalizable and dieomorphism invari-
ant, especially satisfying the integrability conditions discussed in [32], up to order
t2, or two-loop order for vacuum polarization of the traceless mode. the higher
order renormalizability is also discussed from the viewpoint of dieomorphism
invariance. at the end of this section we discuss our computations of quantum
corrections of the cosmological constant up to order t2, to which diagrams up to
3-loops contribute. the computation is quite analogous to 2d quantum gravity,
though the equation used to determine the conformal charge of the cosmological
constant becomes a biquadratic one at this order.
it can be solved perturba-
tively. we nally estimate the strength of the coupling, t, using the results of
recent numerical simulations [21]. section 4 is devoted to conclusions and dis-
cussions. at the end of this section we discuss how to dene the s-matrix and
how to remove the negative-metric states in the 4-th order theory required by
dieomorphism invariance. then, the role of the  f term in the wess-zumino
action is emphasized in analogy to the r gauge in spontaneously broken gauge
theory.

2 review of a two-dimensional model

in this section we re-investigate 2d quantum gravity with n massless scalar
elds, x [24, 25]. since we want to extend arguments to 4 dimensions, we do not
use conformal eld theories here. the wess-zumino action, s, in 2 dimensions,
what is called the liouville action, is given by integrating the 2d conformal
anomaly as

s(, g) =

=

a

a

gr

4 z d2xz 
4 z d2xqg(g + r) .

0

(2.1)

3

here, the wess-zumino condition is dened by

s(, g) = s(, g) + s(  , e2 g) .

(2.2)

one can easily prove that s satises the above equation by dividing the integral
region, [0, ], into [0, ] and [, ].

the coecient a is determined by requiring dieomorphism invariance. let us
apply the general coordinate transformation (1.6) and x = x to expression
(1.3). the action, i, is invariant such that i(x, g) = 0, but s is not. we obtain
the following expression:

s(, g) =

a

8 z d2xqg  r .

(2.3)

this is easily proved by decomposing the general coordinate transformation into
two parts,  =  + , and noting that s is invariant under , which is a trans-
formation law in which  transforms as if it were a scalar eld on the metric g,
such that g = g  + g  and  = , while  is the conformal
change of the metric g and the local shift of , dened by  g = 2g and
 =  with

(2.4)

 =

 .

since  is innitesimal, the r.h.s. of (2.3) can be expressed as s(, g) using (2.4).
thus, (2.3) is nothing but the wess-zumino condition (2.2) with a innitesimal
value (2.4).

on the other hand, the measure, itself, is not invariant, which conformally
changes in the form [d](1+2)g[ehdeh](1+2)g[dx](1+2)g, where  is given by
(2.4). we rst evaluate the measure of the traceless mode. let us take the
gauge-xing condition, ( p 

1 g) = g = 0, to be as usual. we then obtain

[ehdeh]g
vol(di.)

= [ehdeh]g det p 
1

p1( p 

1 g) .

(2.5)

as is well-known, in two dimensions, the r.h.s. can be further written in the
form [34]

p1)

1

2 ,

(2.6)

where [d ] = [ehdeh]g det p 
1 g) stands for the integration over the te-
ichmuller parameter. note that this rewriting is equivalent to taking the gauge
3 up to the zero mode, and hence obtain a gauge-xing
condition h = b
term, bh + 1
2bb, where b ia a symmetric traceless eld. the ghost
action is then given by bh|=c, which is the well-known bc-ghost system,
p1, one must treat the traceless mode

3if instead one chooses the ghost determinant as det p 
1

[d ](det p 
1
1 ( p 

as a quantum eld [4, 30].

4

where b is the anti-ghost related to b and c is the reparametrization ghost.
using the well-known conformal property of the p1 operator [34], we obtain

[ehdeh](1+2)g = [ehdeh]g(cid:18)1 +

26

48 z d2xqg  r(cid:19) .

(2.7)

the measure of  is easily evaluated by using the bilinear term of the action,
i = s + i, as a regulator, which is that of a scalar eld. combined with the
results for the traceless mode (2.7) and n + 1 scalar elds, we obtain

[dx](1+2)g[d](1+2)g[ehdeh](1+2)g exp(i)
= (1  u())[dx]g[d]g[ehdeh]g exp(i) ,

(2.8)

(2.9)

where

u() = 

25  n
48 z d2xqg  r .

thus, the variation of the partition function (1.3) w.r.t. the general coordinate
transformation becomes

z = 6a + 25  n

48

(cid:28)z d2xqg  r(cid:29) .

therefore, the dieomorphism invariance requires [25]

a =

1
6

(25  n) .

(2.10)

(2.11)

the lower dimensional operator generally receives a non-trivial quantum cor-

rection. the cosmological constant operator, r e, for instance, recieves the

quantum correction

 = dim[] = 2 +  ,

(2.12)

where  is the anomalous dimension. in the following we consider the perturba-
n! n, and calculate  using

dimensional regularization [13, 15].

tion theory on  in the at background as e = p n
the combined action in d = 2  2 dimensions is

1

i =

4 z ddxqg(cid:20)a(cid:16)g + r(cid:17) + e + gxx(cid:21) ,

(2.13)

where the bc-ghost is omitted. the conformal mode, , and the constant, ,
are now dimensionless, while the eld, x, has the dimension , where  is an
arbitrary mass scale. the strategy to compute the anomalous dimension using
dimensional regularization is as follows. consider that the coecient a in front
of the wess-zumino action is a bare coupling with dimension 2. we carry out
a renormalization procedure with a being unknown, and compute the anomalous
dimension. after regularization we take   0 and substitute the value of a
required by dieomorphism invariance into regularized quantities.

5

let us evaluate loop diagrams in the at background. we can easily see that
simple poles come only from the one-loop diagram in fig. 1. the sum of the
two-loop diagram (a) and the associated diagram (b) with one-loop counterterm
insertion shown in fig. 2 yields double poles proportional to 4. the higher-loop
diagrams do not also yield simple poles.

the contribution of a one-loop counterterm is also depicted.

hence, the renormalization factor dened by the relation  = zr is com-

puted as

(2.14)

where a is the dimensionless bare coupling dened by a = a2. since the bare
coupling, a, should be independent of the arbitrary mass scale, , we obtain a
nite value at   0,

(2.15)

this value is exact to all orders of the perturbation. we thus obtain the quadratic

(2.16)

where we choose a solution such that   2 at the classical limit a  .
we now re-explain dieomorphism invariance in the context of dimensional
regularization. in the curved background we obtain the one-loop exact countert-

from dus argument [33], the variation of this counterterm w.r.t. the general
coordinate transformation, which is now converted into the conformal change of
the background-metric,  g = 2g, gives the conformal anomaly u() (2.9)
because the conformal change in the scalar curvature in d = 2  2 dimensions
is given by the identity

qg r = 2qg r =  qg r .

(2.18)

we thus obtain the value (2.11), as explained before. substituting this value
into expression (2.16), we obtain the well-known kpz/ddk formula [24, 25] on
spherical topology.

3 four dimensional model

in this section we consider a slightly modied version of a model proposed in

ref. [16]. in 4 dimensions the wess-zumino action becomes 4-th order, parametrized
by three constants a, b and c in the form

s(, g) =

where the addition of c is a modication. f is the square of the weyl tensor and
g is the euler density, dened by

f = rr  2rr +
r2 ,
g = rr  4rr + r2 .

4 is the conformally covariant 4-th order operator dened by [32],

(r) ,

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

which satises 4 = e4 4. thus, in order to ensure dieomorphism invariance
in 4 dimensions the theory must be 4-th order for the gravity sector; only in that
case is the theory renormalizable also.

let us apply the general coordinate transformation (1.6) to the theory (1.3)

in 4 dimensions. the wess-zumino action then changes by

s(, g) =

1

4(4)2 z d4xqg (cid:20)a(cid:18) f +

2
3



 r(cid:19) + b g + c



 r(cid:21) .

(3.5)

7

as in two dimensions, this is nothing but the wess-zumino condition (2.2) for
the innitesimal value,

1
4

 = 

 .

(3.6)

the measure is also not invariant under the transformation, which conformally
changes in the form [d](1+2)g[ehdeh](1+2)g[df ](1+2)g with (3.6). the coe-
cients a, b and c are determined by imposing the condition of dieomorphism
invariance, such that the -dependence from the action and from the measures
cancel out.

the regulator used to evaluate the measures is now the combined action,
i = s + i, which includes unknown constants a, b and c. if the -dependence of
the deformed mesure has the anomaly form (1  u())[d]g[ehdeh]g[df ]g with

u() =

1

(4)2 z d4xqg (cid:20)a(cid:18) f +

2
3



 r(cid:19) + b g + c 

 r(cid:21) ,

(3.7)

where the coecients a, b and c are in general functions of a, b and c, the bmi
condition, u + s = 0, can be written using the equations

a(a, b, c) = a ,

b(a, b, c) = b ,

c(a, b, c) = c .

(3.8)

to be able to impose the bmi condition it is necessary that the -dependence
of the measure is indeed expressed in the above form. it forces matter elds to
be coupled with gravity conformally. as for the gravity sector, we must consider
the 4-th order invariant action, whose form is restricted by the conditions of
renormalizability and dieomorphism invariance discussed below.

we consider the following invariant action including 4-th order terms: 4

i(a, g) = i4th + ile ,

where

i4th =

ile =

1

t2 f + dr2(cid:19) ,

(4)2 z d4xg(cid:18) 1
(4)2 z d4xg(m2r + ) + ia(a, g) .

1

(3.9)

(3.10)

(3.11)

i4th is the 4-th order part, which could be regarded as being a part of the measure.
ile is the usual 2-nd order action which describes low-energy physics. m2 is the
inverse of gravitational constant and  is the cosmological constant.
in this
section we consider u(1) gauge elds, for example. ia is the action of na gauge
elds.

4note that the coecient d corresponds to c in the previous paper [16].

8

we here introduced a dimensionless self-coupling constant, t, only for the

traceless mode in the form [30, 16]

g = (geth) = g(cid:18)

 + th

 +

t2
2

(h2)

 +   (cid:19) .

(3.12)

the general coordinate transformation for the traceless mode is then expressed
as

where  = g. the bmi condition (3.8) is solved in the perturbation of t.

in the following we consider a model with [16]

d =

1
36

(2a + 2b + 3c) .

(3.14)

this condition means that the self-interaction terms of the conformal mode in the
4-th order part of the combined action i cancel out. this model is quite analogous
to the 2d quantum gravity discussed in section 2. in this paper we assert that only
in this case does the theory become renormalizable and dieomorphism invariant
simultaneously in the perturbation of the traceless mode, where the coecients a,
b and c are uniquely determined by dieomorphism invariance.

3.1 renormalization

using dimensional regularization we regularize the model i = s+i with (3.14)
as a theory on the metric g. the plan of this and following subsections is as
follows. here, we assume the renormalizability of our model and derive general
formulae for renormalization and dieomorphism invariance.
in the following
subsections, we show that no inconsistency appears in our model, at least up to
order t2. thus, condition (3.14) plays a crucial role.

in this paper we consider the m2 = 0 case for simplicity. thus, the bare

combined action becomes

i =

(4)2 z ddxqg(cid:20)2b 4 + a f  + b(cid:16) g

 r(cid:17)

f +

(2a + 2b + 3c) r2 + e(cid:21) + ia(a, g) , (3.15)
where d = 4  2. a, b and c are considered to be bare couplings with dimension
2; t is the bare coupling with dimension . for the later use we introduce
dimensionless bare quantities, a, b, c and t, dened by the relations a = a2,

1
36

9

b = b2, c = c2 and t = t, respectively. here, we set the dimension of the
conformal mode to vanish, while the traceless mode has dimension .

the renormalizations of the quantum elds and couplings are dened by the

following relations:

and

 = z 1/2

 r ,

h

 = z 1/2

h h
r

(3.16)

a = zaar ,

b = zbbr ,

c = zccr ,

t = zttr .

(3.17)

since the quantum traceless mode must be gauge-xed to carry out calculations,
we introduce here more good-natured variable, or the background eld [35] for
the traceless mode dened by

g = (eth) ,

(3.18)

where h
dened by the relation [35]

 = 0. the renormalization of the background traceless mode is also

h

 = z 1/2

h

h 
r  .

(3.19)

on the other hand, since the dynamics of gravitational elds is ruled by 4-
th order derivative theory, and matter elds are coupled to gravitational elds
conformally, the counterterms for the background eld become 4-th order:

if = pf

ig = pg

ir2 = pr2

(3.21)

(3.22)

here fr, gr and r2
r are the square of the weyl tensor, the euler density and the
square of the scalar curvature written by the renormalized quantities, respectively.
the pole terms, pf , pg and pr2, are expanded as

(3.25)

where tr is the dimensionless renormalized coupling. the coecients fn, gn, ln
and so on are generally functions of the dimensionless renormalized couplings:
ar, br and cr.

the counterterms, if and ig, are conformally invariant at d = 4, espe-
cially ig becomes topological, which is just an analog of the counterterm (2.17)

10

in 2 dimensions. in d = 4 2 dimensions the square of the weyl tensor and the
euler density satisfy the following identities [33]:

qgr fr = 2qgr(cid:18) fr +
qgr gr = 2qgr gr .

2
3

 rr(cid:19) ,

(3.26)

(3.27)

on the other hand, the counterterm, ir2, is not conformally invariant at d = 4,
because r2 satises the identity

qgr r2 = 12qgr  r .

(3.28)

this counterterm is related to the renormalizations of couplings a, b and c, and
also the integrability condition of the wess-zumino action discussed in [32], which
is discussed in detail in section 3.3.

the renormalization of the background traceless mode is now dened by the

relation

f =

1
t2

1
t2
r

fr  pf fr .

we thus obtain the renormalization factor of the coupling,

and the relation

(zt)2 = 1  pf t2

ztz 1/2

(3.29)

(3.30)

(3.31)

therefore, the background-metric is not renormalized, and hence gr = g.

dieomorphism invariance now implies that the 1pi regularized eective ac-

tion reg = ir + wreg satises the equation reg = 0, or

wreg(gr) =

(4)2 z d4xqgr(cid:20)ar(cid:18) fr +

3

r rr(cid:19) + br gr + cr r rr(cid:21) ,

(3.32)

where  is an innitesimal value (3.6). the general coordinate transformation is
now converted into the conformal change,  gr = 2gr. the r.h.s. of equation
(3.32) comes from the variation of the action ir, while the l.h.s. corresponds to
the anomalous contributions from the measures u(). this equation uniquely
determines coecients ar, br and cr.

3.2 some results on renormalization factors

we present here some results on the renormalization factors discussed in the
previous subsection. let us rst compute the coecients f0, g0 and l0 in the
counterterms. they were already calculated in refs. [14, 16] by considering the

11

case t  0 in the curved background.5 the interaction terms among quantum
elds then vanish and the kinetic terms reduce to conformal invariant ones due
to condition (3.14), such that

the coecients f0 and g0 are given by the values

l0 = 0 .

diagram (b) in fig. 3 is rather simple. the two terms in the vertex l(4)

shown in (3.40), produce logarithmic divergences. the other terms, including
derivatives of h, give vanishing contributions. hence, we obtain the following

therefore, the uv divergences as well as the ir divergences just cancel out in
the sum of (3.46) and (3.47) and we obtain

zbz = 1

(3.48)

at order t2
r.

this result is related to the counterterm, ir2. since g r2 produces the

kinetic term, 2, when the background eld of conformal mode, g = e2,
is considered, the background-metric independence for the conformal mode im-
plies the relation of the renormalization factors, zaz = zbz = zcz, where
z is the renormalization factor of the background conformal mode. since the
background-metric is not renormalized such that z = 1, we obtain

z = 1 ,

za = zb = zc .

thus, result (3.48) leads to

za = zb = zc = 1

(3.51)

here, l1 = 0 is rather trivial because only the one-loop diagrams contribute to
order t2
r, which is a consequence of the cube and quartic self-interactions of 
being dropped by condition (3.14). the result (3.51) is evidence that the action,
s, satisfying the integrability condition [32] exists at tr 6= 0, which is discussed
further in detail in the next subsection.

3.3 dieomorphism invariance at two-loop

in this subsection we discuss the condition of dieomorphism invariance (3.32)
at the two-loop level. to clarify the origin of the interactions we divide the

15

combined lagrangian into three parts, as follows:

f + la(a, g) ,

1
lc = 2b 4 +
t2
lcs = a f  + b g ,
 r +
ln c = 

2
3

b



1
36

(2a + 2b + 3c) r2 .

(3.52)

(3.53)

(3.54)

here, lc is the conformally invariant one. expanding lcs produces conformally
invariant vertices linear to . on the other hand, the last one, ln c, yields
non-conformally invariant vertices.
in the following arguments we omit tensor indices for simplicity. the weyl
tensor is then described as c and c 2 = f , where the subscript r can be dropped
because gr = g. the euler density is also written as g = b2.

first, we discuss the one-loop case [33]. at this order only the conformally
invariant lagrangian, lc, contributes to the eective action. from a dimensional
analysis, the one-loop eective action should have the following form [36]:

w (1) =

t2
r
2



hrk4(cid:18) k2
2(cid:19)(cid:18)v
+ v(cid:19)hr + o()
f  c log(/2) c(cid:19) + v
f
g  b log(/2) b(cid:19) + v

 vf(cid:18)1
+vg(cid:18)1





f

g + o() ,

g

(3.55)

where v and v are symbolical coecients; vf and vg and those with primes
represent true ones related to the conformally invariant counterterms, if and
ig, respectively. the ir cuto mass is canceled out. going to the second line,
2! 2 log2 k2 +    is used. the coecients vf and vg have
(k2) = 1   log k2 + 1
already been computed as vf = f0 and vg = g0 in (3.34). hence, the counterterm
is written as

w (1) = 

f0


f 

g0


g

(3.56)

and the regularized eective action is described as

w (1)

reg = w (1) + w (1)

= f0 c log(/2) c  g0 b log(/2) b + v

f

f + v
g

g . (3.57)

the anomalous contribution is given by the variation of regularized eective

action with respect to the conformal change,  g = 2g, as

with

w (1)

reg = a0a + b0a

a0 = 2f0 ,

b0 = 2g0 ,

16

(3.58)

(3.59)

where a = ( f + (2/3)  r) and a =  g. to derive this expression we use the
following variational formulae:
 f = 2a ,
 g = 2a ,

( c log( ) c) = 2a + o() ,
( b log( ) b) = 2a + o() .

(3.60)
(3.61)

here, note that, using the formulae, we obtain the equation w (1) = 0,7 such
that w (1)
reg = w (1), as used in section 2. thus, from equation (3.32), we
obtain the values of ar and br at tr = 0 as a0 and b0, respectively.

the terms related to the non-conformally invariant counterterm, ir2, in
the regularized eective action in general have the forms r log( /2) r and
r2. the term r log( /2) r breaks the condition of dieomorphism invariance
(3.32), and therefore it must vanish. it is now equivalent to the vanishing of l0
(3.33). this means that in order for the theory to be dieomorphism invariant,
those parts of the action contributing to the one-loop eective action w (1) should
be conformally invariant. this is now ensured by condition (3.14) for the gravi-
tational elds. matter elds must be conformally coupled to gravity. inversely,
only in this case does the theory become dieomorphism invariant. since the
variation of the r2 term is proportional to  r (3.28), this term determines the
value of cr. at the one-loop case, however, the conformal invariance is exact, and
hence such a non-conformally invariant term vanishes. thus, the value of cr at
tr = 0 vanishes.

let us analyse the eective action of order t2

r for zh). at this
order the non-conformally invariant terms in the action contribute to it. the
eective action of order t2

r is divided into three groups as

r (, or order t4

w (2) = w (2loop) + w (counter) + w (1loop) ,

(3.62)

where w (2loop) stands for contributions of two-loop diagrams, which are derived
from the conformally invariant lagrangian, lc. the contribution from associated
diagrams with one-loop counterterm insertion is represented by w (counter). fur-
thermore, there are contributions of order t2
r, but are one-loop diagrams described
by w (1loop), which include the vertices derived from lcs and ln c.
dimensional analysis, w (2loop) has the following form:

since two-loop diagrams have two internal-momentum integrals, from a simple

w (2loop) =

(3.63)

7precisely w (1) = o(), which reects that the conformal invariance of lc violates by o()

in d dimensions.

17

here, the dependences of the momentum and the ir cuto mass, (k2)2, (k22)
and (2)2, in each terms are the features of two-loop diagrams. on the other
hand, since the associated counterterm insertion diagrams are one-loop ones,
w (counter) should have the following forms:

w (counter) =

t4
r
2

hr(cid:18)

f0

 (cid:19)k4(cid:20)(cid:18) k2

2(cid:19)(cid:18)d



+ d(cid:19) +(cid:18) 2

2(cid:19)(cid:18)e



+ e(cid:19)(cid:21)hr .

(3.64)

since the contributions of two-loop diagrams come from the conformally in-
variant lagrangian, lc, the related two-loop counterterms becomes conformally
invariant ones. the conditions of renormalizability and ir niteness give con-
straints on the coecients. from the condition that the non-local divergence,
 log k2
1
2 , cancels in the sum of w (2loop) and w (counter), we obtain the constraint
2x  y + f0d = 0. the cancellation of the ir divergences gives the constraints
y = z = e = 0 and y + 2z  f0e = 0. hence, we obtain the following expression:

w (2loop) + w (counter)

(3.65)

the dieomorphism invariance (3.32) requires that w (2)

reg is proportional to
the anomaly forms a and a. this implies that the nite term including the
square of logarithm should vanish such that

xf = xg = 0 ,

(3.66)

which is equivalent to a vanishing of the double pole in the two loop countert-
erm, namely, the renormalization factor of the background traceless mode, zh,
does not have double poles of order t4
r. on the other hand, using the relation
between the renormalization factors, ztz 1/2
= 1 (3.31), and the niteness of the
-function, one can easily prove that zh does not have double poles of order t4
r.8
thus, the relation ztz 1/2
= 1 guarantees that we can impose the condition of
dieomorphism invariance at the two-loop level.

furthermore, the relation zt = z 1/2

implies that the diagrams with coun-
terterm insertions at vertices and at propagators cancel each other out, and

h

8there is an analogy in qed, where the renormalization factor, dened by e = zeer, satises
the relation zez 1/2
3 = 1 because of the ward-takahashi identity z1 = z2. the regularized 1pi
vacuum polarization does not have logn(/2) with n  2. see, for instance, section 8-4-4
in [37].

next we consider the one-loop part of the eective action w (1loop). re-
call that it includes the interactions derived from the lagrangians lcs and
ln c. since ln c is not conformally invariant, we must consider here the non-
conformally invariant counterterm ir2 also. from a dimensional analysis, we
obtain the following form:

w (1loop) =

the requirement of dieomorphism invariance is now equivalent to that the

non-local term, r log( /2) r, vanishes, or l
9precisely, gauge-xed renormalization insertion diagrams may be necessary [35].
10 note that, from a dimensional analysis, we can not say that w (2loop) vanishes. it,

rather, satises  

 w (2loop) = 0.

19

veried by computing the self-energy diagrams of the conformal mode to order
r in subsection 3.2. from the viewpoint of the vacuum polarization of h, this
t2
implies that the divergences contributing to l
1 in the one-loop diagrams, which
include the vertices coming from the non-conformally invariant lagrangian, ln c,
cancel out. as discussed at the end of this subsection, it is consistent with the
result in [16].

furthermore, the non-local term,  2 log( /2), which changes the form
of the wess-zumino action, does not appear in the regularized eective action
at order t2
r. the background-metric independence for the conformal mode im-
plies that vanishing of this term is equivalent to vanishing of the non-local term,
r log(/2) r.

the anomalous contribution at two-loop level is now given by

w (2)

reg = t2

r(cid:16)a1a + b1a + c1  r(cid:17)

with

a1 = 2f 

1 ,

b1 = 2g

1 ,

c1 = 12ul .

combining the one-loop results, equation (3.32) is now solved as

ar = a0 + a1t2
br = b0 + b1t2
cr = c1t2

r +    ,
r +    ,

r +    .

(3.72)

(3.73)

(3.74)

the coecients a1, b1 and c1 are generally functions of the couplings ar and br,
while a0 and b0 are given by the constants. hence, the bmi condition can be
solved perturbatively.

at higher order the conditions of dieomorphism invariance are expressed as
vanishing of the non-local terms: c logn(/2) c (n  2), b logn(/2) b
(n  2) and r logn(/2) r (n  1). each term with n  2 is likely to vanish
to all orders, as in gauge theories, which is ensured by relation (3.31). the non-
trivial condition is vanishing of the term r log(/2) r. this condition may be
realized when we substitute the values ar, br and cr (3.74) into the expression of
the regularized eective action.

this seems to be a trick of dimensional regularization. if there is a regular-
ization dened exactly in 4 dimensions, like the pauli-villars method, one would
be able to compute the eective action substituting the values of constants an, bn
and cn, required order by order, into the bare action at the begining. then, such
a trick will not be necessary, and we expect that all divergences will be renor-
malized to the coupling t and matter elds and other dimensional constants, and
that the wess-zumino action would not change the form.

the diculty to prove the renormalizability of our model originates from the
fact that to preserve dieomorphism invariance the wess-zumino action should

20

not change the form, while the symmetry to preserve the form of the wess-
zumino action would be nothing but dieomorphism invariance, itself. what can
be done seems to be merely to check for any self-consistencies of the theory. in
this paper we have shown that our model can preserve dieomorphism invariance
self-consistently at n = 0 and 1 of order t2n. since an extension to n  2 would be
unique due to the background-metric independence for the traceless mode, it is
expected that our model would preserve dieomorphism invariance to all orders.
we here comment on studies by kawai, kitazawa and ninomiya [30]. while
we apply dimensional regularization to the theory i = s + i (1.3), dened on
the metric g, it seems that, as far as using dimensional regularization, one could
apply it to theory (1.1), dened on the metric g with great care to the conformal
mode dependence, as discussed by them. the dierence between the two methods
is unclear at present. however, it seems that the two methods might be the same
at   0, at least up to order t2
r, because at this order the divergences of the
self-energy diagrams of the conformal mode cancel out for arbitrary values of
ar, br and cr. detailed analyses on this matter seem to be important to prove
renormalizability to all orders.

to determine the values a1, b1 and c1, it seems that we must carry out full two-
loop calculations. on the other hand, there is a naive argument that the regulator
of the measure is given by the bilinear term of quantum elds in the combined
lagranigan, l = 1
, a). then, using the special
property of 4-th order operators, we obtain the annomalous contribution formally
expressed in the form [16]

2tk + o(3), where t = (, h

 2t r(cid:16)ek(cid:17) ,

(3.75)

where  is a cut-o. it is essentially a one-loop contribution, and hence deter-
mines the values of wf and wg. the proof in [16] of the wess-zumino condition
for 4-th order operators now means that l
1 = wl = 0, which is consistent with
what we mentioned above. here, it is worth commenting on previous work. in
the proof given in section 3 in [16], it was assumed that action s satisfying the
integrability condition [32] exists. therefore, the proof means that, if being, the
variation of the part of the wess-zumino action s related to one-loop diagrams is
given by (3.75). applying the proof to our model, existence at t = 0 is guaranteed
by condition (3.14), but not at t 6= 0. however, since the g dependence of s is de-
termined by the background-metric independence for the conformal mode, the h
dependence of s is uniquely determined by the background-metric independence
for the traceless mode, as mentioned in the introduction. thus, the existence of
s is guaranteed in our model such that wl = 0.

we here conjecture that only the one-loop diagrams contribute to wreg, and
thus a1 = 2wf and b1 = 2wg, because (3.75) is the most simple expression giving
the wess-zumino action at all orders. using the generalized schwinger-dewitt

r. the
contribution to zero-th order of tr is given by the one-loop diagram in fig. 1,

r contributing to the
renormalization factor proportional to 2 are two 2-loop ones (a), (b) and 1-loop
one (c) in fig. 6. unlike the two-dimensional model, there are contributions
proportional to 3 and 4. they are given by diagrams (a) and (b) in fig. 7,
respectively.

11in [16] we used a gauge-xing condition that the conformal mode and the traceless mode
are mixed. but, it is incorrect because we did not introduce the coupling, t, for the conformal
mode. to ensure gauge-independence we here use the feynman-type gauge, and coecients a
and b are re-calculated. now, the o-diagonal term in the operator k becomes 4-th order, but it
can be managed in the perturbation by reducing the expression of t r log k to the formula given
r v
in ref. [12] by using an identity like, for example,  v =  v + 2 r
repeatedly, where the constraints r = 1
4 g r and  r = 0 are imposed as in [16] so that
the coecient cr can not be determined.

the rst term in the parentheses of the r.h.s. comes from the one-loop diagram
in fig. 1, and the second term comes from the sum of the two-loop diagarms,
(a) and (b) in fig. 6. the third one, in parentheses, is the contribution from the
one-loop, but order t2
r diagram (c) in fig. 6. the last two of the r.h.s. come from
(a) and (b) in fig. 7, respectively.

there is no counterterm insertion diagarms, because all subdiagrams, namely,
the sum of (a) and (b) in fig. 3, the sum of (a) and (b) in fig. 8, and also (c)
itself in fig. 8, give nite contributions. furthermore, diagrams (a) and (b) in
fig. 9 each give nite contributions. the niteness of the sum of diagrams (a)
and (b) in fig. 8 and of (c) in fig. 8 is also evidence of renormalizability.

the sum of the diagram of type (a) and associated ones (b), (c) with the

diagram with the gray circle in fig. 11 stands for the diagrams in figs. 1, 6, 7,

(c) in fig. 10 and the sum of the diagrams becomes nite. if the gray part is the
divergent one, the sum of the diagrams yields only double poles.

let us compare our model with the dynamical triangulation approach to 4d
quantum gravity. in this approach there is no ambiguity choosing the measure
unlike regges calculus. furthermore, although this lattice model has parameters
coressponding to the gravitational constant and the cosmological constant, there
is no dimensionless coupling, tr, unlike in the usual lattice gauge theories. this
indicates that, in continuum theory, the measure of a gravitational eld including
4-th order parts may be uniquely determined. here, we estimate the strength of
the coupling constant, tr, realized in recent numerical simulations [21], which
suggest that  is imaginary for na = 0, but becomes real for na  1.
recall that b0 is slightly greater than 4 for a small value of na. thus, 0 is
close to 8. therefore, the 3- and 4-terms and also the third terms proportional
to 2 in the parentheses of (3.81) are estimated as having a value on the order
o(1)  t2
r, while the second term in the parentheses, which comes from the sum
of the two-loop diagrams (a) and (b) in fig. 6, is more than 10-times greater
than them. if |b1|  |b0| is assumed,12 the rst term in the parentheses is also
suciently small. therefore, we neglect the terms of order t2
r, except for the
second ones. then, the equation reduces to a quadratic form, and we obtain the
following discriminant:

j = b0

(3.83)

the results of simulations [21] is now described as j < 0 for na = 0, but j > 4
for na  1. there is a solution of the inequality, and we obtain the value of the
coupling constant: 0.018 < t2
r < 0.028. the corrections from the neglected terms,
mainly b1, are at most 0.005 under the assumption. expression (3.82) is valid
in this region.

4 conclusions and discussions

in this paper we considered the problems of renormalizability and dieomor-
phism invariance in 4d quantum theory of gravity. we considered a perturbation
theory for the traceless mode, where the dimensionless coupling constant t was
introduced, while the conformal mode was managed exactly. we found evidence
that there is a model that satises two conditions of renormalizability and dif-
feomorphism invariance simultaneously; it is uniquely determined to be model
(3.9) with (3.14) if we do not introduce 4-th order elds, except for metric elds.
especially, the vanishing of l1 and l
1 in (3.25), which has been required by the
integrability condition discussed by riegert, fradkin and tseytlin [32], gives a
breakthrough to the two-loop renormalizability of 4d quantum gravity.

our conclusion seems to be plausible from the viewpoint of 4d simplicial quan-
tum geometry, because dynamical triangulation chooses a measure uniquely, and

12note that 2wg is a negative value close to b0 for small na.

25

therefore the measure of the corresponding continuum theory may be determined
uniquely. we expect that it may be given by the 4-th order parts of our model.
the 4-th order model in 4 dimensions is quite similar to the 2-nd order model
in two dimensions. we can rather easily compute the quantum corrections of the
cosmological constant up to order t2
r, as in the case of 2d quantum gravity, and
we obtain the biquadratic equation (3.78) with (3.81). quantum corrections of
the einstein-hilbert term are also quite important, which remain in the future
problems.

in this paper we did not consider gauge interactions, like qed and yang-
mills theories. if gauge couplings are introduced, one has to add a new couplig,
t r(ff ), to the action s. the coecient  is now a function of gauge
coupling determined from the non-local logarithmic terms of regularized vacuum
polarizations.

so far, we have focused only on the two fundamental conditions of renormal-
izability and dieomorphism invariance. theories satisfying such two conditions
might be called quantum geometry rather than quantum gravity. to discuss
quantum gravity, which should describe our universe, we need to dene the s-
matrix.

fig. 12: image of the s-matrix of a re ball/black hole formation

and evapolation. the arrowed lines denote matter elds.
the wavy lines are gravitational elds in the low-energy
asymptotic region. in the re-ball region, the 4-th order
terms are turned on.

recall, as computed in section 3.4, the cosmological constant receives non-
trivial quantum corrections because the propagators of the gravitational modes
are proportional to 1/k4 and tadpole-type diagrams have logarithmic divergences.
this is a dierence between the 4-th order theories and 2-nd order theories which
merely add negative-metric states. one can dene dieomorphism invariant cor-
relation functions in such a fully uctuating geometry. however, when one at-
tempts to dene the s-matrix, one reaches the problem of how to dene the
asymptotic states for the gravitational modes. since the states are always dressed
by the conformal mode when the 4-th order kinetic term of the conformal mode
exists, it seems that one has to consider an unusual interaction picture in which

26

the 4-th order parts are turned o in the asymptotic region, like a picture of
quantum black hole, where the asymptotically at region exist (fig. 12) [38]. in
this picture, negative-metric states in the 4-th order terms required by dieo-
morphism invariance do not appear in the low-energy asymptotic region, because
there gravity is ruled by the einstein-hilbert term. hence, the negative-metric
state is unstable and seems to be conned in the internal high-energy region
where the 4-th order terms are turned on [39, 9, 40].

more directly, as a consequence of the background-metric independence, or
dieomorphism invariance, the presence of the  f term in the action implies
that we can remove the weyl term, f , by shifting the conformal mode by a
constant. thus, although in this gauge the theory becomes unrenormalizable,
we can remove the negative-metric state for the traceless mode. this situation
somewhat recalls the argument of the r gauge in spontaneously broken gauge
theory [41].

let us compute the degrees of freedom in this case. we must now treat the
r2 term. then, the anti-ghost related to b in (3.42) is absent. hence, the
ghost action becomes ch|=c = ch|=c + (c  c), where
c is an anti-ghost related to b, and c is a ghost of dieomorphism invariance.
the ghost determinant is now given by det1/2() det m gh
is
the usual ghost operator of dieomorphism invariance dened in [16]. note that
det() = det()|a scalar (see, for instance, [12]), so that the number of ghost
degrees of freedom is 4 + 4 + 1 = 9. hence, the total degrees of freedom becomes
2  1 + 9 9 = 2. thus, the negative-metric state related to the conformal mode
is also removed by ghosts. we expect that in the general case the anti-ghosts
related to b may remove the negative-metric states for the traceless mode.
