complex geometry represents a fundamental ingredient in the formulation of the dirac equation
by the cliord algebra. the choice of appropriate complex geometries is strictly related to the
geometric interpretation of the complex imaginary unit i = 
1. we discuss two possibilities
which appear in the multivector algebra approach: the 123 and 21 complex geometries. our
formalism permits to perform a set of rules which allows an immediate translation between the
complex standard dirac theory and its version within geometric algebra. the problem concerning
a double geometric interpretation for the complex imaginary unit i = 

1 is also discussed.

i. introduction

in this paper we present a set of rules for passing back and forth between the standard (complex) matrix-based
approach to spinors in 4 dimensions and the geometric algebra formalism. this translation is only partial, consistent
with the fact that the hestenes formalism [1] provides additional geometrical interpretations. in a pure translation
nothing can be predicted which is not already in the original theory. in the new version of diracs equation some
assumptions appear more natural, some calculations more rapid and new geometric interpretations for the complex

imaginary unit i = 1 appear in the translated version for the rst time.

the matrix form of spinor calculus and the vector calculus formulated by gibbs can be replaced by a single
mathematical system, called multivector algebra, with which the tasks of theoretical physics can be carried out more
eciently. the multivector algebra derives its power from the fact that both the elements and the operations of the
algebra are subject to direct geometric interpretation [2]. the geometric algebra is surely the most powerful and
general language available for the development of mathematical physics [3,4]. the central result is a representation
of the dirac wave function which reveals a geometric structure, hidden in the conventional formulation [5].

the projection of the dirac equation into the pauli algebra eliminates redundancies, simplifying our task to solve
this equation, since in the pauli algebra we work in an eight dimensional space over the real numbers, while in the
standard formulation we have to do with a 32-dimensional space over the reals, the space of 4  4 complex matrix
c(4). - zeni [6].
the imaginary unit appearing in the dirac equation and the energy-momentum operator represents the bivector
generator of rotations in a space-like plane corresponding to the direction of the electron spin. - hestenes [7].

we wish to clarify these statements. we agree with fact that in the pauli algebra (isomorphic to the even part of
the space/time algebra cl+
1,3) we have only 8 real parameters in dening the dirac spinors, but in dening the most
general operator which acts on them, how many real parameters do we need? the imaginary unit i is identied by
the bivector 21  cl3,0. is this the only opportunity? what about the possibility to identify the complex imaginary
unit by the pseudoscalar 123  cl3,0?
in formulating the dirac equation by the pauli algebra we can start from the standard matrix formulation and
use the ideal approach to spinors to make a clear translation to the cliord algebra cl4,1 which is isomorphic to
m4(c). the following step is to reduce the formulation of the dirac equation to an algebra of smaller dimension, the
space-time algebra, cl1,3. finally, we get a projection of the dirac equation in the pauli algebra cl3,0 [6].

in this paper we shall perform a dierent approach. we give a set of rules which allow to immediately write the dirac
equation by using the pauli algebra. the fundamental ingredients of this translation are the direct identication of the

complex imaginary unit i = 1 by elements of the pauli algebra and the introduction of the concept of complex

geometry [8,9].

is characterized by 8 real parameters, which can be settled in the following 8-dimensional cliord algebras

cl3,0 [ m2(c)] , cl1,2 [ m2(c)] , cl0,3 [ h  h] , cl2,1 [ m2(r)  m2(r)] .

the natural choice is cl3,0 [ m2(c)], the algebra of the three-dimensional space. such algebra allows an immediate
geometric interpretation for the pauli matrices:

scalar
vectors
bivectors
trivector

cl3,0

21, 23, 31

123

the pauli algebra can be also represented by the complexied quaternionic ring [10,11]:

hc
1

i, j , k
i, j , k

in the following, we prefer to use the vectors ~  cl3,0, in order to avoid confusion in the identication of the
standard (complex) imaginary unit i = 1 by elements of the pauli algebra. by identifying the complex imaginary
unit i = 1 by elements of cl3,0, we must recognize two possibilities

i = 1  21  21 (bivector)

or

123  123 (volume element) ,

in fact

consequently, m + im can be respectively translated by

2
21 = 2

123 = 1 .

m + 21m

or

m + 123m

m = 1, ..., 4 .

we propose in this paper a discussion concerning these two dierent possibilities of translation for the standard
complex dirac theory. these two possibilities are strictly related to the use of two dierent complex geometries,
namely

the 123

and 21

complex geometries .

in our formalism the standard physical results are soon reproduced. the possibility of choosing two dierent complex
geometries in performing our translations will give an embarrassing situation: two dierent geometric interpretations

for the complex imaginary unit i = 1, namely

bivector or volume element .

ii. probability amplitudes and complex geometry

the noncommutativity of the element of cl3,0 algebra requires to specify whether our hilbert space, vcl3

0 , is to be
performed by right or left multiplication of vectors by scalars. we will follow the usual choice and work with a linear
vector space under right multiplication by scalars [10,1217]. in quantum mechanics, probability amplitudes, rather
than probabilities, superimpose, so we must determine what kinds of number system can be used for the probability
amplitudes a. we need a real modulus function n (a) such that

,

the rst four assumptions on the modulus function are basically technical in nature

probability = [n (a)]2 .

n (0) = 0 ,
n (a) > 0 if a 6= 0 ,
n (ra) = |r|n (a) , r real ,
n (a1 + a2)  n (a1) + n (a2) .

a nal assumption about n (a) is physically motived by imposing the correspondence principle in the following form:
we require that in the absence of quantum interference eects, probability amplitude super-imposition should reduce
to probability super-imposition. so we have an additional condition on n (a):

n (a1a2) = n (a1)n (a2) .

a remarkable theorem of albert shows that the only algebras over the reals, admitting a modulus functions with
the previous properties are the reals r, the complex c, the (real) quaternions h and the octonions o. the previous
properties of the modulus function seem to constrain us to work with division algebras (which are nite dimensional
algebras for which a 6= 0, b 6= 0 imply ab 6= 0), in fact

implies

which gives

a1 6= 0 , a2 6= 0

n (a1a2) = n (a1)n (a2) 6= 0

a1a2 6= 0 .

a simple example of non-division algebra is provided by the algebra cl3,0 since

(1 + 3) (1  3) = 0

guarantees that there are nonzero divisors of zero. so, if the probability amplitudes are assumed to be element of
cl3,0, we cannot give a satisfactory probability interpretation. nevertheless, we know that probability amplitudes are
connected to inner products, thus, we can overcome the above diculty by dening an appropriate scalar product.

we have four possibilities:

we can dene a binary mapping h | i of vcl3
that vcl3

,

0 represents the hilbert space with elements dened in the pauli algebra,

0  vcl3

,

,

0 into the scalar(s)/bivectorial(bv) part of cl3,0, we recall

h | i(s,bv ) = (cid:18)z d3x (cid:19)(s,bv )

.

note that the algebra (1, 21, 23, 31) is isomorphic to the quaternionic algebra. thus, we have the mapping

we can also adopt the more restrictive scalar projection h | is:

vcl3

,

0  vcl3

,

0  cl0,2  h .

vcl3

,

0  vcl3

,

0  cl0,0  r .

3

the last two possibilities are represented by the so-called complex geometries

in these case we dene the following binary mappings

h | i(1,21)

and

h | i(1,123) .

vcl3

,

0  vcl3

,

0  cli21

 c(1, 21) ,
 c(1, 123) .

in the standard denition of inner product we nd the operation of transpose conjugation, . how can we translate
the transpose conjugation in the geometric algebra formalism?

the cliord algebra cl3,0 has three involutions similar to complex conjugation. take an arbitrary element

written as a sum of a scalar e0, a vector e1, a bivector e2 and a volume element e3. we introduce the following
involutions

e = e0 + e1 + e2 + e3

in cl3,0 ,

e = e0  e1 + e2  e3
e = e0  e1  e2 + e3
e = e0 + e1  e2  e3

grade involution ,
conjugation ,
reversion .

the grade involution is an automorphism

(eaeb) = e

b ,

while the reversion and the conjugation are anti-automorphism, that is,

(eaeb) = e
(eaeb) = e

b e
a ,
b e

e  e  e. we shall show that the reversion can be used to represent the hermitian conjugation.
let us analyze the following products: , , , which involve the three involutions dened within the
cliord algebra cl3,0. we must consider the two possibilities due to the identication of the complex imaginary unit
i = 1 by 21 and 123. let us perform a real projection of these products,

nevertheless, this real projection of inner products gives an undesired orthogonality between 1, 21 and 123. we

know that the complex imaginary unit, i = 1, represents a phase in the standard quantum mechanics, thus if we

wish to adopt the identications

(cid:0)(cid:1)s

.

i = 1  21 or 123 ,

we must abandon the real geometry. we have another possibility. let us rewrite  as follows

the full  product is given by

 = h1 + 123h2

h1,2  h(1, 21, 23, 31) ,

 = (cid:16)h

1  123h

2(cid:17) (h1 + 123h2) = |h1|2 + |h2|2 + 123(cid:16)h

and so

consequently,

now, (1, 21) and (1, 123) do not represent orthogonal states, and our spinor  have four complex orthogonal
states, the complex orthogonality freedom degrees needed to connect a general element of the pauli algebra to the
4-dimensional dirac spinor

iii. barred operators

we justify the choice of a complex geometry by noting that although there is the possibility to dene an anti-self-
adjoint operator, ~, with all the properties of a translation operator, imposing a non-complex geometry, there is no
corresponding self-adjoint operator with all the properties expected for a momentum operator. we can overcome such
a diculty by using a complex scalar product and dening as the appropriate momentum operator

21-complex geometry
123-complex geometry

~p  ~ | 21 ,
~ ,
~p  123

where 1 | 21 indicates the right action of the bivector 21. for 123, it is not important to distinguish between left
~ still gives a
and right action because 123 commutes with all the elements in cl3,0. note that the choice ~p  21
self-adjoint operator with the standard commutation relations with the coordinates, but such an operator does not
commute with the hamiltonian, which will, in general, be an element of cl3,0. obviously, in order to write equations
that are relativistically covariant, we must treat the space components and time in the same way, hence we are obliged
to modify the standard complex equations by the following substitutions

5

21-complex geometry
123-complex geometry

i   | 21 ,
i  123 .

let us now introduce the complex/linear barred operators. due to the non-commutative nature of the elements of

cl3,0, we must distinguish between left and right action of 21, 23, 31. explicitly, we write

to identify the right multiplication of 21, 23, 31,

1 | 21 , 1 | 23 , 1 | 31 ,

(2)

(1 | 21)   21 , (1 | 23)   23 , (1 | 31)   31 .

note that the right action of 1, 2, 3 can be immediately obtained form the operators in (2) by 123 multiplication.
in rewriting the dirac equation, we need to work with complex linear barred operators. here, we must distinguish
between 21 and 123 complex geometry. in fact, by working with a 123-complex geometry it is immediate to prove
that

represent 123-complex/linear operators. on the contrary, by working with a 21-complex geometry we have only one
permitted right action, that is

1 | 21 , 1 | 23 , 1 | 31 ,

1 | 21 ,

which represents a 21-complex/linear operator. why this counting of parameters? it is simple. in cl3,0 we work
with 8 real parameters, but the most general linear transformation which can be performed on an element of cl3,0,
adopting a 123-complex geometry, is

a + b | 21 + c | 23 + d | 31

a, b, c, d  cl3,0 ,

which contains 32 real parameters, the same number of m4(c). this explains the possibility of a direct translation
between 4  4 complex matrices and the pauli algebra with 123-complex geometry

a. 123-complex geometry and dirac equation

we have now all the tools to reproduce the dirac equation within the algebra cl3,0. it is sucient to translate the

standard equation

by using the identication of i = 1 by 123 and nding a representation of the dirac matrices, , by elements of

the pauli algebra. we observe that the s can be rewritten in terms of elements of cl3,0, by adopting pseudoscalar
and left/right action of bivectors. to reproduce the right anticommutation relation which characterize the dirac
algebra, we perform the following identication

i = m ,

~  (23, 31, 12) .

to satisfy the anticommutation relation between 0 and ~, we introduce right actions

finally, the hermiticity conditions give

0  1 | 32

and

1,2,3  1 | 31 .

6

0  123 | 32 ,
1  12323 | 31 ,
2  12331 | 31 ,
3  12312 | 31 .

the dirac equation reads

t23 + 23x13 + 31y13 + 12x13 = m .

(3)

let us multiply the previous equation by the barred operator 123 | 23,

123t2323 + 12323x1323 + 12331y1323 + 12312x13 = m12323 .

by observing that

we nd

2
23 = 1 , 1323 = 21 , 123 (23, 13, 12) =  (1, 2, 3) ,

123t + 1x21 + 2y21 + 3x21 = m1 ,

(4)

which represents the dirac equation in the pauli algebra with 123-complex geometry. this equation is obtained
by simple translation, so it reproduces the standard physical contents. we are now ready to perform the desired
translation rules:

 

1 + i1
1 + i2
1 + i3
1 + i4







  (1 + 1231) + 21 (2 + 1232) + 23 (3 + 1233) + 31 (4 + 1234) ,

 (cid:0)(cid:1)(1,123)

.

to give the correspondence rules between 4 4 complex matrices and barred operators, we need to list only the matrix
representations for the following barred operators

all the other operators can be quickly obtained by suitable multiplications of the previous ones. the translation of 1
and 123 is very simple:

1 , 21 , 23 , 123 , 1 | 12 , 1 | 23 ,

b. 21-complex geometry and dirac equation

let us now discuss the possibility to write down the dirac equation in the pauli algebra with a 21-complex
geometry. at rst glance a problem appears. we have not the needed parameters in the barred operators to perform
a translation. in fact, the most general 21-complex/linear operator is

7

a + b | 21

a, b  cl3,0 ,

and consequently we count only 16 real parameters. we have no hope to settle down the 32 real parameters charac-
terizing a generic 4 4 complex matrix. nevertheless, we must observe the possibility to perform the grade involution,
which represents a 21-complex/linear operation

thanks to this involution we double our real parameters. let us show the desired translation rules

[ ( + 21)] =  ( + 21)

,   r .

 

1 + i1

 (cid:0)(cid:1)(1,21)

.

to give the correspondence rules between 4 4 complex matrices and barred operators, we need to list only the matrix
representations for the following barred operators

1 , 21 , 23 , 123 , 1 | 21 ,

and give the matrix version of the grade involution. all the other operators can be quickly obtained by suitable
combinations of the previous operations. the translation of 1 and 1 | 21 is soon obtained:

the remaining rules are

1 | 21  i1144 .

and nally the grade involution is represented by the following matrix

.




let us examine how to translate the dirac equation

i = m ,

by working with a 21-complex geometry. firstly, we modify the previous equation by multiplying it by 0 on the left

we observe that (by using the standard representation [18,19] for the dirac matrices)

it + i0~  ~ = m0 .

0 

1 0 0 0

 [(1 + 211) + 23 (2 + 212) + 123 (3 + 213) + 12323 (4 + 214)] ,

and

thus, the translated dirac equation reads:

0~  (1, 2, 3) ,

i1144  1 | 21 .

t21 + 1x21 + 2y21 + 3z21 = m .

we discuss in this section the possibility to relate the two equations obtained by imposing dierent geometries. let
us start by taking the -involution of eq. (6)

  1x + 2y + 3z .

by working with eqs. (6,8) we can reobtain eq. (7). to do it, we introduce the idempotents

123t + 21 = m1 .

e =

(1  3) ,

and give some relations which will be useful in the following

[e, 21] = 0 ,

1e = e1 ,

and

123e+ = e+21 .
let us multiply eqs. (6) and (8) from the right respectively by e and 1e+,

123e = e21 ,

by using the relations in eq. (9), we can rewrite the previous equations as follows

123te + e21 = me+1 ,
123t1e+  1e+21 = me+ .

and

(t + ) e21 = me+1 ,

(t + ) 1e+21 = me+ .

by taking the dierence between these last two equations, we have

(t + ) [e  1e+] 21 = m [e+1 + e+] .

by redening

and noting that

we nd

as anticipated.

  e  1e+ ,

 = e+ + 1e = e+ + e+1 ,

(t + ) 21 = m ,

= e21 .

at this stage, there is not dierence in the using a 123 or 21 complex geometry. so, we have an equivalence between
123 and 21 complex geometry within the pauli algebra.

v. conclusion

the possibility of using cliord algebra to describe standard quantum mechanics receives a major thrust with the
adoption of a complex scalar product (complex geometry). a second important step in this objective of translation
is achieved with the introduction of the so-called barred operators, which permit to write down few translation rules
which allow to quickly reproduce in the cl3,0 formalism the standard results of the dirac theory. all the relations
can be manipulated without introducing a matrix representation, greatly simplifying the algebra involved.

in this paper we worked with the pauli algebra but we wish to remark that our considerations can be immediately

generalized to the spacetime algebra, which represents the natural language for relativistic quantum mechanics.

in the standard literature, the unit scalar imaginary of quantum mechanics is replaced by a bivector. we showed

that another possibility is also available, namely the identication of the unit scalar imaginary i = 1 by the

pseudoscalar 0123 of the spacetime algebra (123 in the pauli algebra). these two geometric interpretations reect
the two possible choices in dening a complex geometry within the multivector formalism. at the free-particle level,
there is an equivalence in using these two complex scalar products.

we conclude by observing that a possible dierence between the 21 and 123 complex geometries could appear in
the formulation of the salam-weinberg model, where the electromagnetic group is obtained by symmetry breaking
from the glashow group su (2)  u (1). it appears natural to use
and

as generators of the electroweak group.
in this case the right choice should be the adoption of a 21 complex
geometry. after symmetry breaking the remaining electromagnetic group will be identied by the left/right action
of the generator 21. a complete discussion of the salam-weinberg model within the multivector formalism will be
given in a forthcoming paper [20].
