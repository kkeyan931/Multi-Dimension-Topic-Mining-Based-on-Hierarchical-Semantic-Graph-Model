abstract

nonlinear gauge theory is a gauge theory based on a nonlinear lie algebra (nite
w algebra) or a poisson algebra, which yields a canonical star product for defor-
mation quantization as a correlator on a disk. we pursue nontrivial deformation
of topological gauge theory with conjugate scalars in two dimensions. this leads
to two-dimensional nonlinear gauge theory exclusively, which implies its essential
uniqueness. we also consider a possible generalization to higher dimensions.

nonabelian chern-simons gauge theory, a topological eld theory (tft) of schwarz

type [1], provides an intriguing framework to deal with three-dimensional pure gravity on

one hand [2] and knot invariants on the other [3]. two-dimensional analogue of such a

framework is given by nonlinear gauge theory [4, 5, 6, 7], which is a gauge theory based

on a nonlinear lie algebra (nite w algebra [7]) or a poisson algebra [8].

1 that is,

nonlinear gauge theory provides a tft framework to deal with two-dimensional pure

gravity (dilaton gravity 2) on one hand [5, 6] and star products on the other [9, 10].

nonlinear gauge theory was originally constructed in part by inspection [4, 5]. in this

paper, we consider nontrivial deformation [11] of abelian bf theory [1] in two dimensions,

which results in nonlinear gauge theory exclusively. 3 two-dimensional nonlinear gauge

theory is unique in this sense, as is the case for chern-simons gauge theory in three

dimensions [11].

we rst recapitulate a few aspects of nonlinear gauge theory. the two-dimensional

theory is given by an action functional [5] 4

wab()hahb,

(1)

where a is a scalar eld, ha is a one-form gauge eld with an internal index a and

d denotes an exterior derivative on a two-dimensional spacetime or worldsheet . the

structure function wab is determined by a nonlinear lie algebra (nite w algebra [7])

[ta, tb] = wab(t ) or a poisson bracket [a, b] = wab() of the coordinates a and b

on a poisson manifold m, as was pointed out by schaller and strobl [8]. this action is

invariant under the nonlinear gauge transformation

a = wbab,

ha = da +

wbc

due to the jacobi identity satised by wab [5].

1more precisely, the structure constants of the algebra determine the couplings in the theory, as
nonabelian gauge theory is a gauge theory based on a nonabelian lie algebra, whose structure constants
yield the couplings of the gauge interaction.

2the metric eld along with the dilaton yields no local physical degrees of freedom in two dimensions,

as is the case for the metric eld in three dimensions.

3quadratically nonlinear gauge theory [4] was obtained in a somewhat related approach by dayi [12].
4this action is intrinsically two-dimensional [4, 5], as the chern-simons action is peculiar to three

dimensions.

with an ordinary lie algebra, this theory reduces to nonabelian bf theory in two

dimensions. when we adopt a nonlinear extension of the two-dimensional poincare alge-

bra, we obtain the palatini form of two-dimensional dilaton gravity [5], as the palatini

form of three-dimensional gravity is obtained as chern-simons gauge theory of the three-

dimensional poincare algebra [2].

when the poisson bracket is nondegenerate to yield a symplectic form  on m, we

can formally integrate out the elds ha to obtain an action

s = z

d1

(3)

of particles with the phase space m and the vanishing hamiltonian, where we adopt a

disk as the worldsheet  and thus  is the boundary circle. then the path integral

z d x(())f ((1))g((0)) exp

i
h

s

(4)

yields an estimation at a point x  m of the (time-)ordered product of functions f and

g on m, where x is a delta function centered at x and the arguments 0, 1 and  of 

denote three points on the circle , placed counterclockwise.

more generally, a canonical star product given explicitly by kontsevich [9] for defor-

mation quantization [13] is obtained perturbatively as a correlator

f  g(x) = z ddh x(())f ((1))g((0)) exp

i
h

s,

(5)

where s is the action eq.(1) of the nonlinear gauge theory on the disk , as was elucidated

by cattaneo and felder [10] (we have omitted the ghost part in the above functional

integral).

let us now consider nontrivial deformation of abelian bf theory in two dimensions

with the aid of the barnich-henneaux approach [11] based on the batalin-vilkovisky

formalism [14], where a solution to the master equation provides a gauge transformation

and an invariant action simultaneously.

the free action is given by

s0 = z d2  ha

 a,

(6)

which is invariant under the gauge transformation

a = 0,

ha

 = a.

the minimal solution to the classical master equation reads

and the brst symmetry is then given by

s = s0 +z d2 h

s = ca

a deformation l to the lagrangian should obey [11]

with its descent equations

thus

s l + da1 = 0

sa1 + da0 = 0,

sa0 = 0.

this deformation is consistent [11] only when the functions fab() verify the jacobi iden-

tity. then the deformed action

s +z l

(15)

satises the classical master equation. for the vanishing antields, it reduces to the action

eq.(1) of nonlinear gauge theory with fab() = wab(). hence we exclusively obtain the

nonlinear gauge theory as the deformation of the free theory in two dimensions.

we nally consider a possible generalization to higher dimensions. let us try a bf-like

lagrangian

this turns out to be invariant under the nonlinear gauge transformation eq.(2) with

(19)

thus deformation theoretic analysis is also called for in higher-dimensional cases.

to conclude, we have obtained the nonlinear gauge theory exclusively as the nontrivial

deformation of the free gauge theory with conjugate scalars in two dimensions. this may

be regarded as a partial result of a systematic search for topological gauge eld theories

of schwarz type: chern-simons, bf and nonlinear gauge theories. they constitute the

simplest class of gauge eld theories, with no local physical degrees of freedom, whereas

they have fertile mathematical contents. this is not so surprising; quantum eld theories

are even expected to describe the whole nature eectively, which is apparently the most

complicated in nature with huge mathematical structures.
