abstract

we present theories of n = 2 hypermultiplets in four spacetime di-
mensions that are invariant under rigid or local superconformal sym-
metries. the target spaces of theories with rigid superconformal in-
variance are (4n)-dimensional special hyper-kahler manifolds. such
manifolds can be described as cones over tri-sasakian metrics and
are locally the product of a at four-dimensional space and a quater-
nionic manifold. the latter manifolds appear in the coupling of hy-
permultiplets to n = 2 supergravity. we employ local sections of
an sp(n)  sp(1) bundle in the formulation of the lagrangian and
transformation rules, thus allowing for arbitrary coordinatizations of
the hyper-kahler and quaternionic manifolds.

1 introduction

it is well known that in theories with rigid n = 2 supersymmetry the hypermul-
tiplet action takes the form of a supersymmetric sigma model with scalars that
parametrize a hyper-kahler manifold [1]. in the case of local supersymmetry the
scalar elds parametrize a quaternionic manifold of negative curvature [2]. in this
paper we study actions for hypermultiplets invariant under rigid or local n = 2
superconformal symmetries. this study is both motivated by recent interest in
superconformal theories [3] and by eorts to nd alternative and hopefully more
convenient formulations of the hypermultiplet actions. the n = 2 superconfor-
mal algebra in four dimensions contains the bosonic subalgebra associated with
so(4, 2) su(2)  u(1), together with 8 real supersymmetry and 8 real special
supersymmetry transformations, called q- and s-supersymmetry, respectively.
requiring that the action is invariant under rigid superconformal transforma-
tions leads to extra constraints on the target-space geometry [4]. for instance,
these manifolds admit a so-called hyper-kahler potential whose derivative denes
a conformal homothetic killing vector and the three complex structures rotate
under the action of the su(2) group, which must be contained as a factor in
the isometry group of the manifold. spaces that satisfy these constraints will be
called special hyper-kahler manifolds1.

by using the superconformal multiplet calculus [5, 6] one can then obtain
corresponding quaternionic sigma models coupled to n = 2 supergravity. be-
cause of the gauge degrees of freedom associated with the dilatations and the
su(2) transformations, a (4n)-dimensional special hyper-kahler manifold leads
to a (4n  4)-dimensional quaternionic manifold. at the time this construction
was applied to only at hyper-kahler spaces or hyper-kahler quotients thereof.
the coupling to supergravity then leads to a quaternionic projective space and
its quaternionic hyper-kahler quotients [6]. but it has been known for some time
that there exist quaternionic spaces that can couple to supergravity which are
not in this class but can be described in the context of the formalism of [2]. some
of them have also been obtained explicitly in the context of harmonic superspace
[7]. therefore it is imperative to apply the superconformal approach to more
general special hyper-kahler sigma models. this application is the main topic of
our paper, where, in order to avoid introducing an innite number of elds, we
will no longer insist on o-shell supersymmetry for the hypermultiplets.

already quite some time ago the very same option was discussed by galicki
[8]. rather than starting from the superconformally invariant hypermultiplets, he
described the geometry of these more general hyper-kahler spaces using a result
of swann [9], who has proven that any quaternionic manifold has a corresponding
special hyper-kahler manifold which admits a quaternionically extended homoth-

1note that hyper-kahler manifolds that are in the image of the c-map are sometimes called
special, because of the underlying special geometry features. we stress that the usage of the
term special hyper-kahler in this paper has no relationship to special geometry.

ety and which has three complex structures that rotate under an isometric su(2)
action. and indeed, the hyper-kahler manifolds that he discusses have many
properties in common with the hypermultiplet actions discussed in [4]. moreover
it is known that a special hyper-kahler manifold is a cone over a so-called tri-
sasakian manifold, so that there exists a beautiful relation between quaternionic
manifolds, tri-sasakian manifolds and special hyper-kahler manifolds (for a re-
cent review, see [10]). the tri-sasakian manifolds have also appeared recently in
the context of supergravity compactications and the ads/cft correspondence
[11].

in this paper we follow the original superconformal approach and start with
the (4n)-dimensional special hyper-kahler manifolds as they were formulated in
[4]. we establish that these spaces are indeed cones over (4n1)-dimensional tri-
sasakian spaces (this feature was also discussed in [12]). the special hyper-kahler
manifolds have only a restricted holonomy group contained in sp(n  1); locally
they are a product of a at four-dimensional space and a (4n  4)-dimensional
quaternionic space. after gauging away the degrees of freedom associated with
the dilatations and the su(2) transformations, the quaternionic space remains
when coupling to supergravity. we present the full lagrangian and transfor-
mation rules for the supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models based on special
hyper-kahler spaces, including the option of gauged isometries. furthermore we
construct local sp(n)  sp(1) sections of the so-called associated quaternionic
bundle which is known to exist for any special hyper-kahler manifold [9].
it
turns out that the use of these sections greatly simplies the formulation of the
transformation rules and the lagrangian. in this way our general results remain
closely in line with the results of [6]; the formulae are identical up to modications
by connections and covariant tensors. when the sections are trivial, so that the
connections can be put to zero and the tensors become constant, they can be iden-
tied with the hypermultiplet scalar elds and one directly recovers the results of
[6]. guided by supersymmetry we thus make contact with the mathematical re-
sults quoted above and we construct the general action and transformation rules
in a new form.

the last topic is to couple these supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models to
supergravity, using the conformal multiplet calculus. in addition to presenting
the corresponding eld theory, we exhibit how the quaternionic manifold emerges
in the coupling. this manifold can now be encoded in terms of sp(n)  sp(1)
sections that are projective with respect to quaternionic multiplication.
our results could facilitate the study of type-ii string compactications on
calabi-yau three-folds. these lead to four-dimensional models with both vector
multiplets and hypermultiplets. while the moduli space of the vector multiplet
scalars is described in terms of a special kahler geometry and is well understood,
much less is known about the full quaternionic hypermultiplet moduli space. it
is known that at string tree level the quaternionic manifolds are obtained from
a special kahler manifold via the c-map [13]. one would like to understand

2

what the corrections are to the classical hypermultiplet moduli space coming
from both string perturbation theory and non-perturbative eects [14]. with
rigid conformal symmetry, the results of this paper could also be helpful in the
description of cone branes [11].

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we briey summarize some
essential features of hypermultiplet lagrangians with gauged target-space isome-
tries. for hypermultiplets there exists no unconstrained o-shell formulation in
terms of a nite number of degrees of freedom, hence the supersymmetry algebra
will only be realized up to the eld equations of the hypermultiplet fermions.
this is in contrast with the vector multiplets, introduced to gauge the isometries,
and the superconformal theory itself, for which o-shell formulations exist. as a
result of the latter, the algebra of gauged isometries and of the superconformal
transformations, including certain eld-dependent structure constants, is com-
pletely xed and not aected by the presence of hypermultiplets. section 3 deals
with rigidly superconformal hypermultiplets, where we nd the constraints on the
hyper-kahler manifold imposed by superconformal invariance. the rst subsec-
tion denes the superconformal transformation rules, the second one deals with
the hyper-kahler potential and the construction of local sp(n)  sp(1) sections,
and the third one gives the lagragian and the transformation rules. the geom-
etry of special hyper-kahler manifolds is explained in section 4. we rst discuss
the cone structure of these hyper-kahler manifolds which lead to a tri-sasakian
space. the latter is indeed an sp(1) bration over a smaller space, which we prove
to be quaternionic. this quaternionic space couples to supergravity, as we then
show in section 5. here we present the action for the hypermultiplets associated
with a special hyper-kahler target space coupled to conformal supergravity and
exhibit how the target-space metric becomes quaternionic.

2 preliminaries

in this section we summarize hypermultiplet lagrangians in at spacetime. as
is well known, these constitute n = 2 supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models
with a hyper-kahler target space [2]. the holonomy group is contained in sp(n)
and it is this group that is relevant for the hypermultiplet fermions. in the rst
subsection we discuss the supersymmetry transformations, the lagrangian and
the target-space geometry. in a second subsection we present possible extensions
related to gauged target-space isometries, which will involve couplings to vector
multiplets associated with the gauge algebra.

2.1 hypermultiplet nonlinear sigma models

we will base ourselves on the formulation of hypermultiplet lagrangians of [15].
with respect to the results of [2] this formulation diers in that it incorpo-

3

rates both a metric gab for the hyper-kahler target space and a metric g 
for the fermions. here we assume that the n hypermultiplets are described by 4n
real scalars a, 2n positive-chirality spinors   and 2n negative-chirality spinors
 . hence target-space indices a, b, . . . take values 1, 2, . . . , 4n, and the indices
, , . . . and , , . . . run from 1 to 2n. the chiral and antichiral spinors are re-
lated by complex conjugation (so that we have 2n majorana spinors) under which
indices are converted according to   , while su(2) indices i, j, . . . = 1, 2 are
raised and lowered. an explicit fermionic metric g  can be avoided as it can
always be converted to a constant diagonal matrix by a similarity transforma-
tion. but retaining a fermionic metric is, for example, important in obtaining
transparant transformation rules under symplectic transformations induced by
the so-called c-map from the electric-magnetic duality transformations on a corre-
sponding theory of vector multiplets. in formulations based on n = 1 superelds
(such as in [16]) one naturally has a fermionic metric but of a special form.

the lagrangian and transformation rules are subject to a number of equiv-
alence transformations, two of which are associated with the target space. one
set consists of the target-space dieomorphisms   (). the other refers
to reparametrizations of the fermion frame of the form    s
()  , and
corresponding redenitions of other quantities carrying indices  or . for ex-
ample, the fermionic metric transforms as g   [ s 1]
 [s 1]
 g. there

are connections, a
, associated with these fermionic redenitions, which ap-
pear in the lagrangian and supersymmetry transformation rules. finally, there
are chiral su(2) = sp(1) redenitions of the supercharges, which in the rigidly
supersymmetric case must be constant and are therefore trivial. in the locally
supersymmetric case this will be dierent and in the latter part of this paper we
will have to deal with local su(2).

the supersymmetry transformations are parametrized in terms of certain -

dependent quantities a and va according to

qa = 2(a
q  = v 
q  = v i 

 i ) ,
i  i  + ai
   ,
a i /ai  qa a

 .
a /ai  qa a

 

(2.1)

in principle a and va each denote (4n)  (4n) complex quantities, but as we
shall see below, these quantites are related and satisfy a pseudoreality condition.
as it turns out they will play the role of the quaternionic (inverse) vielbeine of the
target space. observe that the supersymmetry variations are consistent with a
u(1) chiral invariance under which the scalars remain invariant, while the fermion
elds and the supersymmetry transformation parameters transform. this group
will be denoted by u(1)r to indicate that it is a subgroup of the automorphism
group of the supersymmetry algebra. in section 3 we will see that this u(1) will
correspond to one of the conformal gauge transformations. however, for generic
a and va, the su(2)r = sp(1) part of the automorphism group cannot be

4

realized consistently on the elds. this would require the presence of an su(2)
isometry in the target space. in the above, we merely used that   and   are
related by complex conjugation.

the lagrangian takes the following form

2 gab ab  g ( d/   +  d/  )  1

l =  1
where we employed the covariant derivatives

4w        , (2.2)

   , d  =   + a a


d  =   + a a

 .

 

(2.3)

besides the riemann curvature rabcd we will be dealing with another curvature
, which takes its values in sp(n) =

rab
usp(2n; c). the tensor w is dened by

(2.4)

and will be discussed shortly in more detail.

the target-space metric gab, the tensors a, va and the fermionic hermitean
metric g  (i.e., satisfying (g ) = g ) are all covariantly constant with re-

spect to the christoel connection and the connections a
. furthermore we
note the following relations,

i 
i  = g  v 
gab b

from them one derives a number of useful relations, such as

j

bi = bi  v j 

a = j

ia + j

i gab .

(2.5)

(2.6)

the following three bilinears dene antisymmetric covariantly constant target-
space tensors,

ab = ak  k(i v j)
j ij

(2.7)

that span the complex structures of the hyper-kahler target space. they satisfy

(jij)ab  (j ij
in addition we note the following useful identities,

we also note the existence of covariantly constant antisymmetric tensors,

the tensor  can be used to dene a reality condition on v and ,

this equation leads to

another convenient identity is given by

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

(2.14)

the existence of the covariantly constant tensors implies a variety of integra-
bility conditions which have a number of consequences for the various curvature
tensors [2, 15]. first of all the covariant constancy of a implies

rabcd ci

 dj

 = ij  rab


 .

(2.15)

observe that the right-hand side is manifestly antisymmetric in [ij] and symmet-
ric in (). this implies that the riemann tensor can be written with tangent-
space indices according to

rabcd ai

 bj

 ck

 dl

2ij kl w ,

(2.16)

where, as a result of the cyclicity property of the riemann tensor, w is
symmetric in all four indices. this tensor is linearly related to the tensor (2.4)
upon multiplication with the tensors g and . in terms of w the curvatures
read

rabcd = 1

(2.17)

the above results are all derived from the requirement of supersymmetry.
to characterize the geometry of the target space, one could start from the non-
singular v i 
a and a nonsingular skew-symmetric tensor   that is covariantly
constant with respect to a symplectic connection a

. subsequently one notes
v j 
a and the inverse of va, denoted by b
that ij  
i , are linearly related by a
symmetric matrix gab. requiring that this matrix is real we can identify it with
the target-space metric while the ensuing reality constraint on the va enables
their identication as the corresponding quaternionic vielbeine. this information
is sucient for deriving all the algebraic identities listed above. the vielbeine
and the symplectic connection then allow the denition of an ane target-space
connection, with respect to which the vielbeine are covariantly constant thus
leading to a generalized vielbein postulate. all of above results then follow upon
assuming that the target space has no torsion so that the ane connection and
the christoel connection coincide.

2.2 gauged target-space isometries

i

the equivalence transformations of the fermions and the target-space dieomor-
phisms do not constitute invariances of the theory. this is only the case when the
metric gab and the sp(n)sp(1) one-form v 
(and thus the related geometric
quantities) are left invariant under (a subset of) them. therefore these are related
to isometries of the hyper-kahler space. we can then elevate such invariances to
a group of local (i.e. spacetime-dependent) transformations, by introducing the
required gauge elds in the form of vector multiplets. such gauged isometries
have been studied earlier in the literature [17, 16, 7, 18, 19] and the purpose of
our discussion here is to incorporate them into the formulation used in this paper.
we consider scalar elds transforming under a certain isometry (sub)group g
i (), with parameters i. hence

characterized by a number of killing vectors ka
under innitesimal transformations,

ga = g ika

i () ,

(2.18)

where g is the coupling constant and the ka

i () satisfy the killing equation,

dakib + dbkia = 0 .

the isometries constitute an algebra with structure constants fij

(2.19)

(2.20)

our denitions are such that the gauge elds that are needed once the i become
spacetime dependent, transform according to gw i
 k. the
killing equation generally implies the following property

i w j

dadbkic = rbcae k e

.

(2.21)

i v 

i bv 

ai + akb

quantities that carry sp(n) indices, such as v 

ai, are only required to be
invariant under isometries up to fermionic equivalence transformations. thus
g(kb
bi) must be cancelled by a suitable innitesimal rotation
on the index . here we assume that the eect of the dieomorphism is en-
tirely compensated by a rotation that aects the indices . in principle, one can
also allow for a compensating sp(1) transformation acting on the indices i, j, . . ..
however, the latter transformations must be constant, so they will generically
not appear here. this is equivalent to requiring that the isometry group will
commute with supersymmetry.

let us parametrize the compensating transformation acting on the sp(n) in-
  , where the (-dependent) matrices ti() remain

obviously similar equations apply to the other geometric quantities, but as those
are not independent we do not need to consider them. using the covariant con-
stancy of va, we derive from (2.22),

so that

target-space scalars will satisfy algebraic identities, such as

(ti)

 g + (ti)

 g  = (ti)

[   ] = 0 .

(2.23)

(2.24)

(2.25)

this establishes that the eld-dependent matrices ti take values in sp(n). from
(2.19) and (2.21), it easily follows that


 = k b
dati


i rab

(2.26)

for any innitesimal isometry. from the group property of the isometries it follows
that the matrices ti satisfy the commutation relation

[ ti, tj ]

k (tk)

i kb


j rab
 ,

(2.27)

which takes values in sp(n). the apparent lack of closure represented by the
presence of the curvature term is related to the fact that the coordinates a on
which the matrices depend, transform under the action of the group. one can
show that this result is consistent with the jacobi identity.

furthermore we derive from (2.22) that the complex structures j ij

ab are in-

variant under the isometries,

i cj ij
kc

ab  2[akc

i j ij

b]c = 0 .

(2.28)

this means that the isometries are tri-holomorphic. from (2.28) one shows that
a(j ij
i ) = 0, so that, locally, one can associate three killing
potentials (or moment maps) p ij
i

to every killing vector, according to

i )  b(j ij

(2.29)

observe that this condition determines the moment maps up to a constant. up
to constants one can also derive the equivariance condition,

which implies that the moment maps transform covariantly under the isometries,

summarizing, the invariance group of the isometries acts as follows,

(2.32)

when the parameters of these isometries become spacetime dependent we intro-
duce corresponding gauge elds and fully covariant derivatives,

(2.34)



the minimal coupling to the gauge elds requires extra terms in the super-
symmetry transformation rules for the hypermultiplet spinors as well as in the
lagrangian, in order to regain n = 2 supersymmetry. the extra terms in the
transformation rules are

(2.35)

these terms can be conveniently derived by imposing the commutator of two
supersymmetry transformations on the scalars, as this commutator should yield
the correct eld-dependent gauge transformation.

we distinguish three additional couplings to the lagrangian. the rst one is

quadratic in the hypermultiplet spinors and reads

g = g x i ai

(2.38)

where p ij
is the triplet of moment maps on the hyper-kahler space. these terms

were determined both from imposing the supersymmetry algebra and from the
invariance of the action. to prove (2.38), one has to make use of the equivariance
condition (2.30). actually, gauge invariance, which is prerequisite to supersym-
metry, already depends on (2.31).

3 rigidly superconformal hypermultiplets

in this section we determine the restrictions on the hyper-kahler geometry that
follow from imposing invariance under rigid superconformal transformations. as
we already mentioned in section 1, the corresponding spaces, called special hyper-
kahler manifolds, have an intriguing geometrical structure. in section 5 we will
obtain the coupling of hypermultiplets to conformal supergravity. a crucial ele-
ment in the construction of this coupling is that the full superconformal theory is
known in an o-shell form, so that the superconformal algebra remains unaected
in the presence of matter elds. our goal is more modest in this section where we
only consider rigid superconformal transformations. this aspect does not play
a role for the derivation of the superconformal transformations on the hyper-
multiplets and the results of this section describe the situation that would arise
when freezing all the elds of conformal supergravity to zero in a at spacetime
metric. in that case the superconformal transformations acquire an explicit but
xed dependence on the spacetime coordinates parametrized by a nite number
of spacetime-independent parameters (this is explained, for instance, in [20]).

in the rst subsection we impose the superconformal algebra on the elds and
nd the transformation rules as well as a number of important results for the
complex structures and the moment maps associated with possible isometries. in
the second subsection we derive the existence of a hyper-kahler potential and
reformulate the theory in terms of local sections of an sp(n)  sp(1) bundle.
then, in the third subsection, we present the lagrangian and the transformation
rules in terms of these local sections.

3.1 superconformal transformations

we start by implementing the n = 2 superconformal algebra [5] on the hyper-
multiplet elds. we assume that the scalars are invariant under special con-
formal and special supersymmetry transformations, but they transform under
q-supersymmetry and under the additional bosonic symmetries of the supercon-
formal algebra, namely chiral [su(2)u(1)]r and dilatations denoted by d. at
this point we do not assume that these transformations are symmetries of the
action and we simply parametrize them as follows,

a = d ka

d () + u(1) ka

u(1)() + (su(2))i

k jkka

ij() ,

(3.1)

where the ka are left arbitrary. note that ka
ij() is assigned to the same sym-
metric pseudoreal representation of su(2) as the complex structures, while su(2)
is antihermitean and traceless.

an important dierence with the situation described in the previous section,
is that in the conformal superalgebra the dilatations and chiral transformations
do not appear in the commutator of two q-supersymmetries, but in the com-
mutator of a q- and an s-supersymmetry. to evaluate the s-supersymmetry

10

variation of the fermions, we assume that sa = k  = 0 and covariantize the
derivative in the fermionic transformations with respect to dilatations. subse-
quently we impose the commutator, [ k(k), q() ] = s( /k) on the spinors.
this expresses the s-supersymmetry variations in terms of ka
d ,

s()   = v 

i a ka

d i ,

s()   = v i 

a ka

d i.

(3.2)

with this result we rst evaluate the commutator of an s- and a q-supersymmetry
transformation on the scalars. this yields

[ s(), q() ] a = (ii + ii) ka

a
d + 2jik

b kj (ij  ji) kb
d .

(3.3)

this result can be confronted with the corresponding expression from the n = 2
superconformal algebra, which reads

[ s(), q() ] = m(2iabi + h.c.) + d(ii + h.c.)

+u(1)(iii + h.c.) + su(2)(2ij  h.c. ; traceless) . (3.4)

comparison thus shows that ka

u(1) vanishes and that the su(2) vectors satisfy

b kb
a
ka
d .
ij = jij

(3.5)

now we proceed to impose the same commutator on the fermions, where on the
right-hand side we nd a lorentz transformation, a u(1) transformation and a
dilatation, if and only if we assume the following condition on ka
d ,

dakb

d = b
a .

(3.6)

the geometric signicance of these results will be discussed in later subsections.
here we note that (3.6) suces to show that the kinetic term of the scalar elds
is invariant under dilatations, provided one includes a spacetime metric or, in at
spacetime, includes corresponding scale transformations of the spacetime coordi-
nates. nevertheless, observe that ka
d is not a killing vector of the hyper-kahler
space, although it still satises (2.21), but an example of a conformal homothetic
killing vector. another consequence is that the su(2) vectors ka
ij, as expressed
by (3.5), are themselves killing vectors, because their derivative is proportional
to the corresponding antisymmetric complex structure

dakij

b = j ij
ab .

(3.7)

from this it follows that the kahler two-forms are exact, provided that the killing
vectors are globally dened. the product rule of the su(2) killing vectors can
now be worked out and one nds

kb ij bka kl  kb kl bka ij = 2 ka (i(k l)j) ,

(3.8)

11

which is indeed in accord with the su(2) structure constants.

from the [s, q] commutator we also establish the fermionic transformation

rules under the chiral transformations and the dilatations,

   = 0 ,

su(2)   + su(2)a a
u(1)  + u(1)a a
   =  1


  = 3
d  + da a

2i u(1)  ,

2 d   .

(3.9)

note that the u(1) transformation further simplies because u(1)a = 0.

to establish that the model as a whole is now invariant under the superconfor-
mal transformations it remains to be shown that the tensor v 
ai is invariant under
the dieomorphisms generated by ka
d up to compensating transfor-
mations that act on the sp(n)sp(1) indices in accordance with the transforma-
tions of the   given above and the symmetry assignments of the supersymmetry
parameters i. to emphasize the systematics we ignore the fact that ka
u(1) actually
vanishes and we write

u(1) and ka

in these equations the rst two terms on the left-hand side represent the eect of
the isometry or dilatation, the third term represents a uniform scale and chiral
u(1) transformation on the indices associated with the sp(n) tangent space, and
the last terms represent an su(2), a u(1) and a scale transformation, respectively,
on the indices associated with sp(1). eq. (3.10) should be regarded as a direct
extension of (2.22).

we close with a few comments. first of all, the su(2) isometries induce a

rotation on the complex structures,

kl cj ij
kc

ab  2[akc

kl j ij

b]c = 2jklc[a j ijc

b] = 2(i

(k l)m j j)m
ab ,

(3.11)

as should be expected. under dilatations, the kahler two-forms jab scale with
weight two, whereas the complex structures j a

b are invariant.

secondly, one can verify that the isometries introduced in subsection 2.2 com-

mute with scale transformations, provided that

this leads to another identity,

ka
i = kb

d dbka
i .

gab ka

i kb

d = 0 .

(3.12)

(3.13)

in particular these results hold for the su(2) killing vectors and imply, in addi-
tion, that the latter commute with the tri-holomorphic isometries. to see this, one

12

ij dbkia as kb

writes kb
d dabpiij using (3.5), (2.29) and the fact that the complex
structures are covariantly constant. interchanging the order of the derivatives and
extracting the complex structure then gives

kb
ij dbka

i = j a

ijb kb
i ,

(3.14)

which implies that the tri-holomorphic killing vectors commute with su(2).
from the above equations one can derive the following result for the variation of
the moment maps under a dilatation,

d ap ij
ka

i = j ij

ab ka

d kb

i = kij

a ka

i = 2p ij
i ,

(3.15)

i.e. they scale with conformal weight 2. here we have adjusted an integration
constant in p ij
in the last equation. combining the above equation with previous
i
results, one establishes that the moment maps transform under su(2) according
to

kl ap ij
ka

i = 2(i

(kl)m p j)m

i

.

(3.16)

the latter expresses the fact that the moment maps form a triplet under su(2).
it is then easy to check that the action is invariant under dilatations, u(1) and
su(2).

3.2 hyper-kahler potential and sp(n)  sp(1) sections

the existence of the homothetic killing vector satisfying (3.6) has important
consequences for the geometry. first of all (3.6) implies that ka
d can (locally) be
expressed in terms of a potential , according to kd a = a. up to a suitable
additive integration constant, one can then show that [12]

() = 1

2gab ka

d kb
d .

(3.17)

observe that  is positive for a space of positive signature. a second (covariant)
derivative acting on  yields the metric, and therefore a third derivative vanishes,

dadb = gab ,

dadbdc = 0 .

(3.18)

the rst condition expresses the fact that the metric is the second (covari-
ant) derivative of some function, somewhat analogous to the kahler potential
in kahler metrics, but now written in real coordinates. a kahler potential is
guaranteed to exist for any hyper-kahler space, but the potential  does not
always exist. in the literature  is sometimes called the hyper-kahler potential
(see, e.g. [9, 8]). this means that  serves as a kahler potential for each of the
three complex structures, as follows from the following equation,

1

2( c

a + j 
a

c) ( d

b  j 

b

d) dcdd = j 

ab ,

(3.19)

13

where j  = (2)ij j ij and  = 1, 2, 3 is kept xed.

the hyper-kahler potential  is invariant under isometries, as follows directly

from (3.13). in particular it is invariant under the su(2) isometry; explicitly,

 = (su(2))i

kjk kb

ij b = (su(2))i

kjk jij ab kb

d ka

d = 0 ,

(3.20)

where we made use of (3.5). however, it is not invariant under dilatations,

 = kb

d b = 2 .

(3.21)

another interesting consequence of the homothety is that it enables a refor-
mulation in terms of local sections of an sp(n)  sp(1) bundle. the existence
of such a so-called associated quaternionic bundle is known from general argu-
ments [9]. these sections are dened from the s-supersymmetry variation of the
hypermultiplet spinors (c.f. (3.2)),

they satisfy a quaternionic pseudo-reality condition

ai   (ai

) = ij   g  aj

 ,

(3.22)

(3.23)

as follows from (2.12). using (3.6) one proves that the covariant derivative of ai
reproduces the quaternionic vielbeine,



dbai

3.3 the hypermultiplet action and transformation rules

in this subsection, we write the hypermultiplet action and transformation rules
() introduced in (3.22). the complete lagrangian,
in terms of the sections ai
including the terms associated with gauged isometries, can be written as

l =  1

where the covariant derivatives are dened by

   ,

and we have used lie-algebra valued vector multiplet elds associated with gauged

(3.35)

the rst relation follows from (2.23) and (3.12), and for the second equation we
made use of the last equality in (3.15).

the action may be compared to the one in [6] (more precisely, to the part that
pertains to the rigidly supersymmetric lagrangian). however, in that reference,
 are identical to the coordinate elds, whereas in the present more general
the ai
case they are local sections as explained in subsect. 3.2. because the target-
space manifold is not at, we encounter a nontrivial metric in (3.33) as well as

15

nontrivial sp(n) connections in the covariant derivatives (3.34). furthermore, the
generators ti() associated with the isometries are not constant, but depend on
the scalar elds as we indicated before. this means that the lie-algebra valued
vector multiplet elds associated with the gauged isometries depend also on the
hypermultiplet scalars. their denitions are


 = w i

w

y ij

i
 = i i [ti ()]

x 

 = x i [ti()]

 ,

i



 = i

i [ti()]

 .

(3.36)

nevertheless, the correspondence with the formulation in [6] will be helpful later
on when evaluating the coupling to conformal supergravity.

in order to obtain the transformation rules of the sp(n)sp(1) sections under

dilations, su(2) and isometry transformations, we use the general relation

ai

 = bbai

 = b v 


ai

 .

(3.37)

b i  bb

using (2.9), (2.23) and (3.12), we then nd for a combined dilatation, chiral
transformation and target-space isometry, that

ai

 = dai

 + (su(2))i

j aj

 + gi ti


 ai

  aa

 .

(3.38)

this result should be combined with that for the fermions, derived in the previous
section,

  = 3

2d  a  1

2 iu(1)   + gi ti



    aa


  .

(3.39)

similarly we determine the transformations under q- and s-supersymmetry,

 = 2 i  + 2 ij g   j   qbb
ai
  = d/ ai
 i ,
i  qbb
 ai
 ai  ijj + ai  i .
  = d/ ai i  qbb

   + 2g x 

   + 2g x 


 ijj + ai


 ai

(3.40)

again, we stress that, apart from the sp(n) connection (and a slight change
in notation), these transformation rules are identical to the ones specied for a
at target space [6], where the local sections can be identied directly with the
target-space coordinates.

finally, we recall that it is straightforward to write down actions for the vector
multiplets that are invariant under rigid n = 2 superconformal transformations.
those are based on a holomorphic function that is homogeneous of degree two
[21].

4 cone structure and quaternionic geometry

in this section we discuss the properties of the special hyper-kahler space. we
will show how this space can be described as a cone over a tri-sasakian man-
ifold. the latter spaces (which are of dimension 4n  1) are characterized by
the existence of three (1, 1) tensors and three killing vectors that are subject to
certain conditions. a manifold is tri-sasakian if and only if its cone is hyper-
kahler. tri-sasakian spaces are einstein and take the form of an sp(1) bration
over a quaternionic space. this quaternionic space is the one that appears in
the coupling of hypermultiplets to supergravity (for more details, see [10], where
the relation between special hyper-kahler, tri-sasakian and quaternionic spaces
is reviewed from a more mathematical viewpoint).

we start by noting that the riemann tensor vanishes upon contraction with

any one of the four vectors (ka

d , ka

ij), i.e.

rabce ke

d = 0 ,

rabce ke

ij = 0 .

(4.1)

the rst equation (4.1) is derived by antisymmetrizing the second equation (3.18)
in the indices [ab]. the second equation (4.1) follows from inserting (3.7) into
(2.21).
incidentally, (4.1) implies that the ricci tensor has at least four null
vectors. however, in the case at hand this poses no extra restrictions as hyper-
kahler spaces are ricci-at. the above results can also derived from the fact
that the sp(n) holonomy group is reduced to sp(n  1), c.f. (3.28). this follows
from applying (3.30).

we recall that these four vectors are orthogonal (cf. (3.5), (3.17)),

ka
d kda = 2  ,

ij kkl
ka

a = k

(il

j)  ,

d kij
ka

a = 0 .

(4.2)

this implies that the hyper-kahler manifold is locally a product r4  q4n4,
where r4 denotes a at four-dimensional space. by decomposing r4 as r+  s3,
we can write the hyper-kahler manifold as a cone over a so-called tri-sasakian
manifold; the latter is then a bration of sp(1) over q4n4. hence the manifold
can be written as2 r+  [sp(1)  q4n4]. spaces with a homothety can always
be described as a cone. this becomes manifest when decomposing the coordi-
nates a into coordinates tangential and orthogonal to the (4n  1)-dimensional
hypersurface dened by setting  to a constant. the line element can then be
written in the form [12],

ds2 =

d2
2

+ 2 hab(x) dxa dxb ,

(4.3)

2strictly speaking it is sp(1)/z2 where sp(1) is the group that acts on the quaternionic

vielbeine and on the sections introduced in the previous chapter.

17

where the xa are the coordinates associated with the hypersurface3. in the present
case this hypersurface must be a tri-sasakian space and the hyper-kahler space
is therefore a cone over the tri-sasakian space.

the purpose of the remainder of this section is to establish that q4n4 is
a quaternionic manifold. in the next section we show how q4n4 arises in the
coupling of hypermultiplets to supergravity. the tangent space of the hyper-
kahler space can be decomposed into the four directions along (ka
ij), and a
(4n 4)-dimensional space q4n4 that is locally orthogonal to that. tensors that
vanish upon contraction with (ka
let us introduce a vector eld va ij which will serve as a connection for sp(1)

in a way that will become clear shortly,

va ij =

(4.4)

this vector eld is invariant under target-space dilatations and gauge isometries,
i.e.

dva ij = kb
gva ij = kb

d bva ij + akb

d vb ij = 0 ,
i vb ij = 0 ,

and rotates under target-space su(2), as follows from

b = 2(i(k v l)j)

with va ij we associate an sp(1) curvature tensor,

observe that  is a projection operator, i.e., it satises   = ,

and it projects onto the (2n  2)-dimensional subspace orthogonal to the ai

(4.9)

3in terms of a radial variable r2 = 2, this yields the usual form of a cone metric

ds2 = dr2 + r2 hab(x) dxadxb .

note that we have kb
dilatations and su(2) transformations. one can also show that  dbai

the identity (4.7) can be generalized to

where

gab = 1ij daai

 dbaj

(4.10)

(4.11)

(4.12)

observe that both gab and rabij are of zero weight under the homothety and
are horizontal, i.e., they vanish upon contraction with any of the four vectors
(ka
ij), and are thus orthogonal to the corresponding (local) four-dimensional
subspace.

d , ka

the tensor gab will provide a metric for q4n4. the relation between gab

and the hyper-kahler metric gab is given by

(4.13)

where we have used (3.30) and (3.31). observe that this relation reects both
the cone structure of the hyper-kahler space and the sp(1) bration of the tri-
sasakian space. it is not possible to give an explicit expression for the inverse
metric, at least not in general, but this is not really needed in view of the hor-
izontality of gab. when acting on horizontal tensors,  gab acts as the inverse
metric in view of the identity

gac gcd gdb = 1gab .

(4.14)

associated with q4n4 and  projects onto the tangent space of q4n4. more
precisely, we introduce the following related sets of 4n  4 vectors,

v j

(4.15)

which satisfy algebraic relations that are completely analogous to those satised
by the quaternionic vielbeine of the hyper-kahler space. in particular we note
that va and a are each others inverse in the reduced (4n4)-dimensional space,
(4.16)

v 
bj = gab ,

ij  v 
ai

 gab i
a

v 
bj = i

j   ,

19

where   is the identity matrix projected onto the (2n  2)-dimensional
subspace. the signicance of these results will become clear in due course.
subsequently we note that there exists an identity similar to (4.13) which

relates the complex structures to the eld strength rabij,

jij ab = 

1
 hkd[a kijb] + kl kki[a kljb]i  1

2  rabij .

this motivates us to introduce the following tensors,

a straightforward calculation using (4.17) shows that they satisfy

j ij
ab = j ij

a

cgcb .

jabij =  1

2rabij ,

(4.17)

(4.18)

(4.19)

so that the jabij are antisymmetric, horizontal and scale invariant. furthermore
these tensors satisfy the product rule

 j ij

ac gcd j kl

db = 1

2i(kl)j gab + (i(k j l)j)
ab ,

(4.20)

which is similar to (2.8). the tensors jabij are candidate almost-complex struc-
tures in the horizontal subspace q4n4. under su(2) target-space transforma-
tions they rotate into each other according to
kl jcbij + bkc

kl jacij = 2 (i(k jab l)j) .

kl cjabij + akc
kc

(4.21)

given a horizontal tensor hab that is invariant under the homothety and
the su(2) target-space transformations, then the covariant derivative of such a
tensor is no longer horizontal. this can be cured by making use of a modied
covariant derivative da, dened so that the following properties hold,

d

ka
ka
ij

dc hab = kc
dc hab = kc

dc hab = 0 ,
dc hab = 0 .

the modied derviative is obtained by using a modied target-space connection,

ab

c = ab

c  c

(a b) ln  + 2v(a ij j ij c

b)

.

(4.23)

because the modication is symmetric in (a, b), the connection remains torsion
free. observe that da(gbc), dakb
ij should be zero when contracted
with a horizontal tensor. this is obviously the case as can be seen from the
formulae,

d and dakb

da(gbc) = (b

(4.24)

the above construction can be generalized to tensors h that carry also su(2) in-
dices, indicating that they transform covariantly under target-space su(2) trans-
formations, e.g. as in ka
(kl)j h j in the simplest case. then one can
show that the derivatives of these tensors are still horizontal, provided one co-
variantizes da and includes an su(2) connection va ij. the crucial identity for
showing this is ka

kl ah i = i

a = k

(i l

j).

with respect to the new connection, gab is covariantly constant,

ij v kl

dc gab = 0 ,

(4.25)

so that the new connection must be just the christoel connection associated
with gab. likewise the tensors jabij are covariantly constant modulo a rotation
that involves the sp(1) connection,

dcjabij = 2 vck(i jabj)l kl .

(4.26)

note that the terms on the right-hand side covariantize the derivative on the left-
hand side with respect to su(2). hence the tensors jabij dene three almost-
complex structures in the space q4n4 which are covariantly constant up to an
sp(1) rotation proportional to the sp(1) connections. this implies that q4n4 is
a quaternionic space (see e.g. [22]).

to verify this result, let us compute the riemann tensor associated with the

new connection (4.23).

rabc

d = rabc

d  gc[a d

b] + rabij j ijd

c  rc[aij j ijd

b]

.

(4.27)

observe that the right-hand side is not horizontal, but by construction (via the
ricci identity) is horizontal when acting on a horizontal tensor with lower index
d. hence, when lowering the index by contraction with the metric gde one must
obtain a horizontal tensor. this is conrmed by explicit construction,

rabcd  rabc

e ged

= 1 rabcd + gd[a gb]c + rabij j ij

cd  rc[aij j ij

b]d . (4.28)

by virtue of (4.19) rabcd has all the symmetry properties of a riemann tensor.
observe that the explicit factor of 1 arises because the original curvature of
the hyper-kahler manifold is dened by lowering the upper index by means of
the metric gde. furthermore it satises the bianchi identity d[a rbc]de = 0.

let us now calculate the ricci tensor, which is symmetric by virtue of (4.25),

rab =  racbd gcd = 2(n + 1) gab .

(4.29)

oberve that we used that the original hyper-kahler manifold was ricci at and
that gab gab  = 4(n  1). we may also verify the expressions for the sp(1)
holonomy
(4.30)

rabcd gcegdf 2j ij
ef = 4(n  1) j ij
ab ,
21

where we used that the original hyper-kahler manifold has zero sp(1) holon-
omy. these are the expected results [23] for a (4n  4)-dimensional quaternionic
manifold with sp(1) curvature given by (4.19).
this completes the discussion of target-space properties. we now return to
aspects related to the sp(n) bundle over the special hyper-kahler space. first of

all we consider a modication of the connection a
 such that the the modied
 remains orthogonal. this requires
derivative of a tensor that is orthogonal to ai
 itself. when
that this derivative acting on ai
combining this with a few other obvious requirements4, we arrive at the following
connection,

 must be proportional to ai

 v ij

(4.31)

with this modication, the tensors  and g  remain covariantly constant.
the presence of the term proportional to v ij
a is required to preserve covariance
with respect to target-space su(2) transformations. this term also ensures that
the modication is horizontal. with the modied connection we establish the
required result,

daai

 = 1

2a ln  ai

 + vaik al

 kl ,

(4.32)

where the last term can be interpreted as an su(2) covariantization of the deriva-
tive on the left-hand side. the result (4.32) suces to show that the modied
derivative of a tensor that is orthogonal to ai
it is
now obvious that the projection operator  is covariantly constant under the
modied derivative

, will remain orthogonal.

da = 0 .

(4.33)

including the modied connections ab

c and a

 as well as the su(2) con-
nection v ij

terms that are proportional to ak
introduced in (4.15) are covariantly constant with respect to the new connections,
so that we have

4in determining the precise modications of the various connections, we were also guided to
some extent by supersymmetry. however, this aspect is postponed to sect. 5, where we outline
the signicance of the results of this section in the context of the coupling of hypermultiplets
to supergravity.

explicitly evaluate this tensor,

which indeed satises the rst integrability relation. note that all expressions
appearing in (4.36) are horizontal.

now we recall that for a special hyper-kahler manifold the tensor w

dened in (2.16) satises the constraint

w ai

 = 0 .

(4.37)

with this in mind we write the new curvature tensors as follows,

one can now verify that these curvatures satifsy also the second integrability
condition (4.35). we will return to this and related issues in the next section.

we close this section with a brief discussion of the isometries. for every tri-
holomorphic killing vector of the special hyper-kahler manifold we construct a
corresponding vector in the horizontal manifold q4n4 by the projection

kia = gab kb
i .

(4.40)
by explicit calculation one can then show that dakib + dbkia = 0, so that we
have a corresponding killing vector in the horizontal space and thus an isometry.
observe that the su(2) isometries of the special hyper-kahler manifold do not
generalize in this way, because the corresponding kia would simply vanish. this
is not so surprising, as the su(2) acts on the corresponding tri-sasakian space
through its sp(1) bre.

to study whether these isometries are tri-holomorphic in the horizontal sub-

space, we rst raise the index according to

ka
i =  gabgbckc

i = ka

i + 2 p ij

i ka
ij .

(4.41)

where piij = 1piij. the transformation of the almost complex structures in
the horizontal subspace is then governed by the expression,
i cjabij  2[akc

i jb]cij = kc

i jb]cij

i (kc

23

the rst line on the right-hand side is zero, as follows from (4.17) and the fact
that the isometries are tri-holomorphic and commute with dilatations and su(2)
in the special hyper-kahler space. the second line is equal to 4jabk(i j)l p kl
i
by virtue of (4.21). we can now elevate the derivatives on the left-hand side to
su(2) covariant dervatives. in this way we nd

da(jbcij kc

i )  db(jacij kc

i ) = 2rabk(i j)l p kl

i

(4.43)

where we used the horizontallity of kc
variant constancy of) rabij  jabij. the solution is given by

i and the bianchi identity for (or the co-

kb

jabij

(4.44)

which can also be veried by explicit calculation. by substituting previous results
one veries directly the modied equivariance condition,

jabij ka

kb
j = fij

k pkij + 4 kl pik(i pjj)l .

(4.45)

the above results are in complete agreement with the moment map construction
for quaternionic manifolds [24, 18]. the fact that the isometries generated by ka
i
act consistently on horizontal tensors is ensured by the following identities which
follow from explicit calculation,

kb

5 locally superconformal hypermultiplets

in this last section we consider the coupling of the hypermultiplets to supercon-
formal gravity. to that order we introduce the weyl multiplet, which contains
the gauge elds associated with the superconformal symmetries as well as some
extra matter elds [5]. the bosonic gauge elds are the vielbeine ea
, the spin-
connection ab
 , the dilatational gauge eld b, the gauge eld associated with
special conformal boosts f a
 and the gauge elds associated with su(2)u(1),
i
j (antihermitean) and a. the fermionic gauge elds are the grav-
denoted by v
itino elds i
 and the elds i
 associated with s-supersymmetry. finally, the
matter elds are tab ij (antisymmetric and selfdual in lorentz indices and anti-
symmetric in su(2) indices), a spinor i and a real scalar d. the elds ab
 , f a

and i
 are not independent and can be expressed in terms of the other elds.
we refer to [5, 6] for more details on the notation and conventions.

24

the transformation rules have been given in previous sections, but will change
in the context of local supersymmetry. the most obvious change concerns the
replacement of the derivatives by derivatives that are covariant with respect to
the additional gauge symmetries. the derivatives covariant with respect to the
bosonic gauge symmetries for the scalar elds, the sections and the fermion elds,
read

where we have also included the terms related to possible gauged isometries.
all covariantizations follow straightforwardly from the formulae presented in sec-
tion 3.3 and from the gauge eld conventions given in [5, 6]. observe that the

derivative in a multiplying the connection a
 does not require an additional
covariantization.

the transformation rules under q- and s-supersymmetry are now as follows,

(5.3)

we have veried that no further modications of the fermionic transformation
rules beyond those given above are possible, assuming that the bosonic transfor-
mation rules remain the same. one of the underlying reasons for the absence of
additional terms may be that the above rules are already consistent with rigid su-
persymmetry and with the case of a at hyper-kahler manifold which was taken
as a starting point in [6]. all additional modications would thus have to vanish
in the corresponding limits, while at the same time one must preserve covari-
ance under target-space dieomorphisms and fermionic frame reparametrizations.
therefore the possible modications should be proportional to the target-space
curvature times the superconformal elds and, as it turns out, it is dicult if
not impossible to see how such terms could emerge. given the fact that the
transformation rules take the same form, we expect the same situation for the

25

lagrangian, where, again, it is dicult to construct suitable modications that
would vanish in the appropriate limits.

motivated by these considerations, we write down the lagrangian by convert-
ing and covariantizing the relevant equation (3.28) in [6]. here we suppress the
hypermultiplet auxiliary elds, as we no longer insist on o-shell supersymmetry
for the hypermultiplets. the result reads as follows, where the derivatives are all
fully covariantized,

after substituting the expressions for the dependent gauge elds i

as follows,

here we did not include the terms related to gauged isometries. to incorporate
those one includes the relevant terms into the covariant derivatives and adds the
following g-dependent terms to the lagrangian,

(5.6)

as mentioned above, these results are in agreement with the action presented
in subsection 2.2 as well as with the results of [6] in the appropriate limits.

26

in addition we performed a number of independent checks on (5.5) and (5.6).
for instance, because the superalgebra closes only modulo the eld equations
for the fermion elds   and  , we have calculated these eld equations from
the supersymmetry transformation rules (5.2). as it turns out the result is in
agreement with the eld equations derived from the action.

the above action is invariant under all superconformal symmetries. in par-
ticular the scalar elds are subject to dilatations and to su(2) transformations.
ignoring the contributions from the vector multiplets, which are essential for ob-
taining the complete and consistent action for poincare supergravity coupled to
vector multiplets and hypermultiplets, but which do not aect the target-space
geometry of the hypermultiplets, we express the bosonic terms in scale-invariant
quantities, by introducing a normalized section

ai

 = 1/2 ai

 ,

(5.7)

 aj

which satises  ai
 = ij. similarly we redene the various other elds,
such as the vierbeine, spin connection, etcetera, by a -dependent scale transfor-
mation. the result for the bosonic terms then takes the form
3r  di ,

2 eh  ij d ai

l =  1

(5.8)

where r is the ricci scalar of the spacetime. suppressing possible gauged isome-
tries for convenience, this results in

(5.9)

(5.10)

this result can be substituted back into the lagrangian, which then reads

l =  1

2 e gab a b + 1

6e r + 1

2 e d ,

(5.11)

so that the target-space metric gab corresponds indeed to the quaternionic space
which we constructed in the previous section. the terms with the ricci scalar
and the auxiliary eld d combine with similar terms from the lagrangian of the
vector multiplets to give the einstein-hilbert action.

the material derived in the previous section now ts in nicely with what is
known about the general coupling of hypermultiplets to supergravity [2]. first
of all, the quantity  projects out precisely the s-invariant hypermultiplet
spinors which thus describe 2n  2 physical spinors after modding out the s-
supersymmetry. hence, the nonlinear sigma model comprises precisely the ex-
pected 4n4 scalars and 2n2 spinors. the relevant quaternionic vielbeine have

27

already been dened in (4.15), but can equally well be obtained from working out
the above lagrangian after removing the appropriate gauge degrees of freedom
we will list a number of relevant identities, which all follow from the previous
section,

the second integrability condition (4.35) can be rewritten as

(5.13)
which gives the decomposition of the riemann tensor into an sp(n  1) and
an sp(1) curvature. of course, this relation is already incorporated into the
expression (4.38) and its correctness can also be veried directly. the curvature

upon projection with , the last term vanishes and one nds an identity that is
well-known from the literature.

hence we see that all aspects of quaternionic geometry that arise in the cou-
pling of hypermultiplets to supergravity are correctly reproduced. our results
provide an elegant extension of the work reported in [6] and give a unied pre-
scription for all hypermultiplet couplings to supergravity. although this is in
principle straightforward, it remains to work out the details of the lagrangian
and transformation rules after removing the gauge degrees of freedom associated
with s-supersymmetry.
