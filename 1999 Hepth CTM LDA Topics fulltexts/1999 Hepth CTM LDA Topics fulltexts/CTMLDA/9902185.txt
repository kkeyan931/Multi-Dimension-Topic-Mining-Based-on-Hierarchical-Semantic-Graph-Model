(basic feature charge conjugation matrix c c transforms conjugate representation .) list properties cd c used work given appendix. 1 one-generation matter eld regularized lagrangian standard model reads lreg = +i 6d+ mr(t r cdc11r + rcdc11 r ) + ri 6dr + 1 2 + r11i 6dr 1 2 mr(t r cdcr rcdc r ). (1) 6d covariant derivative respect so(10) gauge eld a, 6d = ( igaij ij), ij so(10) generators; mr = r, (large) mass parameter (paulivillars mass) summation r 1 assumed. form mr crucial convergence diagrams model  concrete sign mr matter. introducing projectors irreducible spinor representations: = 1 2 (1 5) p = 1 2 (1 11) chirality properties elds read: + = r = r = 0, p+ = pr = pr = 0, r = r+ + r analogously r. so(10) gauge model anomaly free, big surprise (1) could rewritten vector-like form. following  introduce variables r = r+ + ccd r, r = r+ + ccd r. (2) new elds so(10) chiral lorentzian non-chiral spinors contrary original ones. pr = pr = 0, +r = r+; r = ccd r, +r = r+; r = ccd r. using denitions (2) ones following r = r+ rccd r = r+ rccd, eq.(1) takes form lreg = +i 6d+ + r(i 6d mr) + r(i 6d + mr). (3) 2 berezian corresponding change variables (2) 1, guarantees lagrangians (1) (3) describes one theory. want reformulate (3) higher derivative theory. following  rst step replace commuting paulivillars elds anticommuting ones. idea consider instead following one l = (i 6d ) l = ( + )(i 6d )( + ), (4) (5) additional dynamical eld. lagrangian large stuckelberg- type gauge symmetry. xing produces faddeevpopov ghosts ( ) statistics, opposite , i.e. normal anticommuting spinors. particular gauge choice brings (5) (4) plus ghosts terms trivially decoupled dynamics; another gauge choice leaves l = (i 6d ) (6) (plus decoupled -terms). thus eqs.(4) (6) describe physics. true provided sources eld (and ) model exactly situation paulivillars elds. applying procedure described r lagrangian (3) could rewritten as: lreg = +i 6d+ + r(i 6d + mr) r(i 6d mr), (7) elds anticommuting now. next step combine dierent terms (7) single higher derivative lagrangian. shown  lagrangian l = g (i 6d m1)(i 6d m2) suitable legendre transformation could put form l = g |g| (cid:0) 1(i 6d m1)1 2(i 6d m2)2(cid:1) 3 vice-versa, provided m1 > m2. note sign last lagrangian indepen- dent coupling constant g. decomposition sum rst order lagrangians holds higher derivative lagrangian l = qi(i 6d mi), mi 6= mj i, j : 6= j. use results bring together dierent terms (7). combine paulivillars terms equal r obtain lreg = +i 6d+ r(1 6d2 2r2 ), used freedom choose coupling constant gr = (m r)2. way introduced small parameter (1/m ) counts order derivatives lagrangian. parameter needed higher derivative theory . automatically produces called perturbative constraints exclude unwanted negative norm states (those paulivillars elds case). add one new second derivative terms matter eld term get l = 6d yr=1 (cid:18)1 6d2 2r2(cid:19) . (8) solution equation motion following lagrangian (8) = p (i 6d r)r = 0. describes full set matter paulivillars elds. r remnant perturbative constraints |physical >= 0 (9) excludes paulivillars elds physical ones. finally, using formula obtain sin (x) = x yr=1 (cid:18)1 x2 2r2(cid:19) lreg = sin(cid:18) 6d (cid:19). (10) eq.(10) together constraint (9) give us nonlocal version regularized lagrangian standard model. 4 nal note: lagrangian (10) could rewritten lreg = 6df (d2/m 2), f (x2) = sin x/x. form closely related interpretation generalised paulivillars regularization discussed . appendix lorentz charge conjugation matrix . 4-dimensional space-time metrics g = diag(1, 1, 1, 1) gamma matrices , = 0, 1, 2, 3 such, ( ) = . matrix 5 dened 5 = 0 1 2 3 ( 5) = ( 5)t = 5. charge conjugation matrix cd (the one used inverse ) properties: c 1 ( )t cd = , = 0, . . . , 3 c 1 5cd = 5, cd = cd = c = c = c 1 , det cd 2 = 1. so(10) charge conjugation matrix . corresponding gamma matrices i, = 1, . . . , 10 32 32 matrices, {i, j} = ij = i. 11 matrix dened 11 = i1. . . . .10, 11 = 11 = 11. generators so(10) algebra spinorial representation ij = 1 2 i, following properties: 6= j, i, j = 1, . . . , 10. charge conjugation matrix c c 1t c = i, = 1, . . . , 11 c 1t ijc = ij , c = c = c = c = c 1, det c 2 = 1. 5
