abstract

we compute threshold eects to gauge couplings in four-dimensional zn orientifold

models of type i strings with n = 2 and n = 1 supersymmetry, and study their de-
pendence on the geometric moduli. we also compute the tree-level (disk) couplings of

the open sector gauge elds to the twisted closed string moduli of the orbifold in var-

ious models and study their eects and that of the one-loop threshold corrections on

gauge coupling unication. we interpret the results from the (supergravity) eective

theory point of view and comment on the conjectured heterotic-type i duality.

introduction

2

the purpose of this paper is to study threshold corrections to gauge couplings in certain

n = 2 and n = 1 type i orientifolds [1]-[9]. such vacua are of obvious phenomenological
interest, but for a long time they had received much less attention than their weakly-

coupled heterotic counterparts. as has been, however, recognized recently, type i vacua

oer some added exibility for model building, and can exhibit several novel interesting

features.

in particular, since gauge interactions are localized on d-branes the tree-level

relations between gauge couplings and the string, compactication and planck scales are

not universal [10, 11], making it easier to consider scenarios in which these scales are

hierarchically-dierent [12]-[20]. the question of whether such scenaria can be reconciled

with the apparent unication of the observed low-energy couplings was the main motivation

for this work.

type i vacua are furthermore conjectured to have dual heterotic descriptions in appro-

priate circumstances [21]-[23]. thus, another motivation for the present work has been to

further elucidate this duality in the most interesting n = 1 context [5, 7], by a detailed
comparison of threshold corrections on the two sides, even if they cannot be simultaneously

weakly coupled in ten dimensions. moreover, the knowledge of the moduli dependence of

gauge couplings is required for any phenomenological application of type i string theory, and

is intimately related to the problems of supersymmetry breaking and possible dynamical

determination of the moduli vacuum expectation values (vevs).

threshold corrections to gauge couplings in heterotic vacua have been studied exten-

sively in the past and general results have been obtained for orbifold and smooth manifold

compactications [24, 25]. their comparison to the eective eld theory is particularly in-

structive and reveals the existence of a universal non-holomorphic correction associated to

the so called green-schwarz term [26, 27]. on the type i side on the other hand, previous
study was focused on the n = 2 orientifold based on the t 4/z 2 orbifold [28, 29].

3

in this work, we rst generalize the studies to other n = 2 orientifolds obtained by
toroidal compactications of six-dimensional (6d) vacua and compute the general one-loop

dependence of gauge couplings on the geometric moduli t  r1r2 and u  r1/r2 of the
two-torus with radii r1,2. for vanishing wilson lines, the corrections are proportional to the

beta function coecients and therefore they amount changing the unication scale from the

string to the compactication size. the latter can be much larger than the string scale in a

weakly coupled theory, in which case it is more appropriate to identify it as the winding scale

of the t-dual theory. this result allows two possibilities for unication. (i) when the two

radii are dierent r1 > r2, there is a linear correction r1/r2 [17] that can be interpreted as

a power-law evolution [30, 15] between 1/r1 and 1/r2, leading to unication at 1/r2 [15].

(ii) if the two radii are approximately equal r1  r2, there is only a logarithmic correction
which could possibly accomodate a conventional unication scenario at energies much

larger than the string scale [17, 18]. threshold corrections can alternatively be interpreted

as tree-level dependence of bulk elds on the transverse space [18]. these corrections

are non-universal (group dependent) if tree-level couplings to bulk elds are dierent for

the various gauge group factors. in fact, there is a tree-level (disk) dependence of gauge

couplings on the twisted neveu-schwarz (ns) moduli associated to twists dierent than

z2s. this dependence is already present at the level of six-dimensional theory, where these

moduli are part of tensor multiplets [31, 32]. although in some particular examples this

new (tree-level) contribution is miraculously proportional to the (one-loop) beta-function

coecients, in which case the unication scale is arbitrary, in the generic case the couplings

become free parameters and the unication is lost.

these results are generalized easily in the case of 4d compactications with n = 1
supersymmetry. the geometric moduli dependence of the one-loop threshold corrections

receives contributions from the n = 2 sectors only, controled by the n = 2 beta-functions,
in analogy with the heterotic case. on the other hand, n = 1 sectors provide moduli
independent contributions that can be interpreted as one-loop running up to the string

4

scale. as a result, if the string scale is low the only way to achieve unication is through

the n = 2 beta-functions. however, as in n = 2 compactications, there is a non-
universal tree-level dependence of the gauge couplings on the twisted ns-ns moduli for

twists dierent than z2s [33], which apriori can destroy unication. in this case though,

a new phenomenon appears due to the existence of anomalous u(1)s. at the points of

maximal gauge symmetry, the vevs of the twisted moduli are xed and unication is

recovered up to one-loop level.

we also compare our results to the eective supergravity. unlike the heterotic case,

we nd that compatibility requires the existence of several non-universal (gauge group

dependent) green-schwarz terms associated to the twisted ns-ns moduli 1 which now

belong into several linear multiplets. in the n = 1 orientifold examples the vanishing of
the anomalous u(1)s d-terms at the points of maximal gauge symmetry, imply a vanishing

vev for the twisted moduli coupled to gauge elds, in the string (linear multiplet) basis.

this implies in particular for the zodd orbifolds that physical gauge couplings have no

dependence on geometric moduli up to one-loop level and unication arises at the type i

string scale 2. moreover, this result raises doubts on the validity of the conjectured heterotic

 type i dual pairs with n = 1 supersymmetry.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we recall open string propagation in

constant magnetic elds, that provides the method we use for computing the corrections

to gauge couplings. in section 3, we derive the moduli dependence to gauge couplings of

generic 4d n = 2 orientifolds obtained by toroidal compactication from six dimensions.
in section 4, we study in detail gauge coupling in the context of the 4d n = 1 zodd (z3
and z7) orientifolds, while in section 5, we study the n = 1 z6 and we obtain general
in section 6, we compute threshold corrections in
expressions valid for any orientifold.

1this result was also obtained recently in ref. [34], while our work was in print.

2this result seems to contradict the recent claim of ref. [35].

2. background-eld method

the one-loop diagrams of type-i string theory are the torus t , the klein bottle k, the
annulus a, and the mobius strip m . the diagrams with boundaries (a and m) describe
in the direct channel the propagation of the open string degrees of freedom, including gauge

bosons and charged matter elds. the other two diagrams (t and k) have no boundaries
coupling to chan-paton charges  they describe the propagation in the loop of closed-

string degrees of freedom related to the gravitational sector of the theory. since the t and
k diagrams cannot couple to external open-string states, they do not contribute to the
renormalization of couplings in the open sector of the theory. these diagrams will not be

of interest to us in the present work.

we will here focus our attention to four-dimensional orientifolds obtained by orbifolding

the six real (three complex) internal coordinates by the twist  = (e2iv1, e2iv2, e2iv3), where
v  (v1, v2, v3) is called the twist vector and where for a zn orbifold n = 1. the two

and nally q = et. in the mobius amplitude  is the world-sheet involution operator

which exchanges left and right moving excitations of the closed string and acts as a phase
on the open string oscillators : m = eimm, with the upper plus sign for the nn
coordinates and the lower minus sign for the dd coordinates (n=neumann, d=dirichlet).

the supertrace stands for a sum over all open-string states  this includes the sum over

chan-paton states of the two endpoints and the integration over four-momenta,

str = (xbos  xf erm

(2.3)

the action of a twist element k on the n possible chan-paton states is realized by n  n
matrices k.
in the simplest cases we have n = 32, corresponding to the 32 d9-branes

of the ten-dimensional theory. more generaly however the four-dimensional orientifold

may also contain d5-branes, corresponding to additional chan-paton states. conversely

n and the rank of the gauge group can be reduced by turning on b backgrounds in the

internal manifold [36]. tadpole consistency conditions [37] severely constrain the chan-

paton matrix , and hence also the gauge group and the charged matter content of the

corresponding vacuum.

we will compute the one-loop corrections to the gauge couplings using the background-

eld method [38, 28]. to this end we turn on a magnetic eld in the (for example) x1

direction

f23 = bq ,

(2.4)

where x0    x3 are the uncompactied spacetime dimensions, and q is an appropriately
normalized generator of the gauge group. the eect of the magnetic eld on the open-string

spectrum [39] is to shift the oscillator modes of the complex x 2 + ix 3 string coordinate by

7

an amount , where

 = arctan(qlb) + arctan(qrb) ,

(2.5)

and ql(r) is the eigenvalue of the gauge-group generator q acting on the chan-paton states

at the left(right) endpoint of the open string. for notational simplicity, the dependence of

 on the chan-paton states will be left implicit in the sequel. the torus and klein-bottle

amplitudes are not aected by the magnetic eld, while the annulus and the mobius strip

are obtained by making in (2.1) the replacements [38, 39]

where 23 is the spin operator in the (23) direction, the integer n = 0, 1,   labels the
landau levels, and (ql + qr)b/2 is the degeneracy of landau levels per unit area.

the full one-loop vacuum energy has the weak-eld expansion

for supersymmetric compactications the one-loop cosmological constant vanishes, 0 = 0.

the term quadratic in the background eld contains the one-loop threshold corrections.

more precisely, if we choose q to be an appropriately normalized generator 3 inside the ath

with the upper and lower limits corresponding, respectively, to the ultraviolet and the

infrared regions in the open channel. as explained in references [28],[17] in the context of

the z2 orientifold [2], the integral must converge in the ultraviolet limit if all the tadpoles

have been cancelled globally, and provided that the background eld has no component

along an anomalous u(1) factor. the potential infrared divergences, on the other hand,

are due to massless charged particles circulating in the loop, so that

limt ba(t) = ba

(2.10)

is the -function coecient of the eective eld theory at energies much lower than the

last massive threshold.

the quartic term in the expansion (2.7) is quadratically divergent due to the on-shell

exchange of massless closed-string modes [28], [22]. these include the dilaton, the graviton

and, in the cases of interest to us here, the twisted ns-ns moduli elds mk of the orbifold.

these twisted moduli have non-universal couplings to the gauge elds of the gauge group

as conjectured, using anomaly-cancellation arguments and supersymmetry, in ref. [31, 32,

33]. in eq. (2.11), the sum over k goes up to the integer part of (n  1)/2 which counts
the number of independent twisted sectors of the orbifold. note that the supersymmetric

partners of the mk are rr axions, dual to antisymmetric two-index tensors (ns=neveu-

schwarz, r=ramond). by analyzing the divergences of 4 we will calculate the coecients

sk explicitly, and conrm the conjecture of [33]. this is important for discussions of unica-

tion, since such twisted modes could give rise to non-universal shifts of the gauge coupling

constants at tree level.

in order to analyze the divergences of 4 we must reexpress the amplitude as an integral

over the modulus l in the transverse (closed-string) channel. this is related to the direct

9

channel modulus as follows,

l =

l =

in the untwisted (k = 0) sector comes from the exchange of a graviton and dilaton and has

been analyzed in [28, 22]. for even n the k = n/2 sector has no quadratic divergences,

consistently with the fact that z2 twist elds do not couple to the yang-mills action. 4 for
the remaining sectors (k = 1,   [ n1

2 ]) we will show that

(2.16)

where the dots stand for exponentially-suppressed terms and the precise values of the

the corresponding divergence in 4, as coming from the exchange of an on-shell twist eld

coupling to the background f through equation (2.11). notice that the closed-string

propagator for a canonically normalized scalar is

written formally as 

2 r  dl.

3. n = 2 supersymmetry: k3  t 2 orientifolds

we begin our discussion with six-dimensional zn models [2, 3, 4], compactied further

down to four dimensions on a two-torus. the twist vector for these models is of the form

v = (1/n,1/n, 0). assuming no antisymmetric tensor backgrounds, tadpole cancellation
requires the presence of 32 d9 branes, and for even n of one set of 32 d5 branes. it also

xes the matrices 9 and ,9 which represent the action of the orbifold twist  and the

orientation reversal  on chan-paton states in the d9 sector, as well as the corresponding

ones in the d5-brane sector.5 the particular case of the z2 orientifold, n = 2, is the one

analyzed previously in reference [28].

in this section we will extend the analysis to the

other models of type a (using the language of [3]), namely the z3, z4 and z6 orbifolds.

we will consider a background eld living on the d9 branes of these models. to simplify

the formulae we will further restrict our attention to the case where all d5-branes are located

together at a xed point of the orbifold, and there are no (99) wilson lines. the amplitudes

of interest are the (99) annulus and mobius diagrams with insertion of a non-trivial twist
k (k 6= 0) and, in the presence of d5 branes, the (95) annulus with or without insertion
of a twist. the (55) diagrams do not couple to the background eld, while the untwisted

(99) diagrams have eectively n = 4 supersymmetries and thus do not contribute to
in the absence of a magnetic eld the relevant
the renormalization of gauge couplings.

amplitudes are (for k 6= 0)

5 consistently with the group property the action of k and of k can be represented by the product

matrices k and k respectively .

here left implicit. the factor of 2 in front of the (95) diagram counts the two orientations of

the open string, and (2)(t) is the lattice sum over momenta along the untwisted two-torus.

finally, the trace in the annulus amplitudes is over the tensor product of chan-paton states

for the left and the right endpoints of the open string, while in the mobius amplitude the left

and right chan-paton charges are equal and we have used the identity tr2k = tr(1

as previously, the  argument of the jacobi functions [ 

 ](z| ) is implicit, while the
argument z is only shown when it is non-zero. note that the shift  of the oscillator frequen-

cies depends on the charges of the left and the right string endpoint  the corresponding

jacobi functions have therefore been left inside the chan-paton trace. more explicitly in

view of the denition (2.5) we have

(3.6)

the lattice sum and the orbifold partition function, on the other hand, are independent of

the chan-paton states since we have assumed vanishing wilson lines.

in order to compute threshold corrections, we must expand the above formulae to

quadratic order in the background eld. we need the following taylor expansions

  (ql + qr)b + o(b3) ,
1(z)  23 z + o(z3) ,

a + o(z4) for a = 2, 3, 4 .

(3.7)

the integrands simplify enormously if one uses the modular identities (a8) of appendix

a which reduce the entire string-oscillator sum to a number. as explained in [28],[40],[22]

this is a consequence of n = 2 supersymmetry: only short bps multiplets can contribute
corrections to the gauge couplings, and all open-string excitations are non-bps. after some

straightforward algebra the nal result for the one-loop corrections (2.9) takes the form

we have here used the obvious identity trd  e = trdtre, and the fact that if q does
not have a component along an anomalous u(1), all the traces involving an odd power of

q are zero. note also that q must commute with 9 or else the corresponding gauge eld

would not have survived the orbifold projection.

the lattice sum in equation (3.8) has been regularized by the poisson-resummation

prescription [22, 17]. let us introduce the usual geometric modulus of the two-torus

(which spans the dimensions 4 and 5),

where the hypermultiplets transform in the representations r of the gauge group ga. the

gauge groups, charged hypermultiplets, and the chan-paton matrix 9 for these models

are summarized for convenience in table 1. following the conventions of [3] we use a

the expressions (2.9) and (3.8) for the one-loop corrections to the gauge couplings,

in (3.8), with mr the masses of the hypermultiplets in six dimensions, and modify the

kaluza-klein sum appropriately if there are non-vanishing wilson lines on the two-torus.

the potential t  0 divergence of the integral, and hence also the subtraction term in
(3.11), are not aected by these soft corrections.

let us turn now to the ultraviolet divergences of the amplitudes (3.3-3.5). to investigate

them we must reexpress the amplitudes as integrals over the proper time l in the closed-

string channel. performing the sequences (2.13,2.14) of modular transformations, a poisson

resummation of the kaluza-klein sum, and using the well-known modular properties of the

where we have separated inside the square brackets the contributions coming from the

exchange of ns-ns closed-string states (proportional to the inverse sines) and those coming

from rr states (which are proportional to the cotangents).

out of the above three amplitudes only a99 contains mixed terms with charge-operator
insertions at both the left and the right cylinder boundaries. the a95 diagram has one of it
boundaries stuck on d5-branes, which are blind to the (99) gauge groups, while the mobius

diagram has only a single boundary anyhow. these latter two diagrams combine with the

pure terms (all charge insertions on the same boundary) of a99 to give an infrared-nite
expression in the closed-string channel. this is a consequence of tadpole cancellation, which

garantees that a zero-momentum massless particle cannot disappear into the vacuum in

the absence of the magnetic-eld background. this can be checked explicitly using the

chan-paton matrices of table 1. for instance for the z3 model, there are no d5-branes and

tr9 = tr2

9 = 8, which is precisely the condition for the sum of a(2k)

99 and m(k)

99 to be nite

in the l   limit of the integration.

the leading non-cancelled divergences arise at quartic level from mixed terms of the

a99 amplitudes. they are due to the exchange of twist-eld scalars transforming in tensor
multiplets of n = 1 supersymmetry in six dimensions, and coupling to the yang-mills
action as in (2.11). all models with the exception of z2 contain such tensor multiplets,

localized at the xed points of the orbifold [3]. since the perturbative heterotic string

has only a single tensor multiplet, only the z2 model has a perturbative heterotic dual,

whose threshold calculation agrees with the results on the type-i side [23]. note that

supersymmetry does not allow the coupling (2.11) for hypermultiplets, so that in the z2

model the twisted cylinder amplitude is infrared nite [28].

expanding out to quartic order the expressions (3.18) and using (2.7) we nd

124g

4 = 

n

n1

xk=1,k6=n/2

sin2kv(trq2k)2z dl .

(3.19)

the physical interpretation of the term (3.19) of the type (trf 2)2 is that twisted ns-ns

17

elds mk appear in the tree-level (disk) gauge kinetic function of the gauge group and

generate at one-loop (tree-level in the transverse, closed string picture) a tadpole. by

using the integral form (2.17) for the propagator of a canonically-normalized scalar7, one

can extract the couplings sk (2.11) for the various models. the result is:

sk =

22

g1/4n| sin kv|(trq2k) .

(3.20)

because of the peccei-quinn symmetries generated by the rr axions, these couplings8

must be linear (at the perturbative level) in mk.

as previously discussed, these couplings are zero for the z2 example in table 1 and

for the corresponding sectors k = n/2 of the models z4 and z6. they are also zero for

the k = 1 twisted moduli couplings to the u(8) gauge factor in the z6 model, because

trq2

u (8)9 = 0 in this case.

in one particular example (z3) these couplings are proportional to the 4d beta func-

tions and therefore in this case the unication is preserved. notice however that the twisted

moduli elds are exact at directions in the eective eld theory, therefore by using the

expression of the gauge couplings (2.11) we nd that the unication scale is an arbitrary

parameter in these models. in all the other examples, unication is lost because the cou-

plings sk are not proportional to the 4d beta functions. we should also mention that some

of the gauge couplings become strong for critical values of mk, as it was rst pointed out

in [31].

7the gauge elds couple actually to linear combinations of twisted elds which in our conventions are

canonically normalized

8strictly speaking, the metric gkl of mk should appear also in (3.20). the string result (3.20) is valid

around mk = 0, it therefore contains only the rst term gkl(m) = kl +  in a taylor expansion.

18

4. n = 1 supersymmetry: the z3 and z7 models

our goal in this section is to compute the one-loop corrections to the gauge coupling

constants coming from the n = 1 sectors. in zn orbifolds with n a prime integer. due to
the absence of order two twist elements, these orientifolds have no 5-branes in the spectrum

and are therefore the simplest 4d models with n = 1 supersymmetry.

the annulus amplitude in the zn type i orientifolds with odd n can be written

contribution of the k  ()k sectors given by

(4.7)

a rst check of the formula (4.7) is by taking the infrared limit t   , in which case the
one-loop expression (4.7) must reproduce the one-loop running of the eective eld theory,

controled by the renormalization group (rg) coecients. in this limit we nd

(4.8)

lets now check the result (4.7) in the z3 example case. the z3 four-dimensional

n = 1 type i orientifold [5] is dened by the twist vector v = (1/3, 1/3,2/3). the
tadpole consistency conditions ask for 32 d9 branes in the spectrum and x the chan-paton
matrix  = diag (e2i/3i12, i4), where in is the n  n identity matrix. the matrix  then
determines the gauge group to be su(12) so(8) u(1)x (the u(1)x factor is anomalous
2,
[5], [7]) and the charged matter elds are in the representations 3(12, 8)1 + 3(66, 1)
where the subscripts denote the u(1)x charges. this model contains only n = 4 (0) and
n = 1 (1, 2 )sectors.

diag (1,1, 014) , qso(8) = qu (4) =

1

(4.10)

and therefore trq2k = 1/2 for su(12) and trq2k = +1 for the so(8) gauge group fac-
tors. finally, by cutting-o the integral in (4.7) by introducing the infrared (ir) regulator
t  1/2, we nd the ir behaviour

which is indeed in agreement with the eld theoretical rg coecients b1(su(12)) =

are independent of the compactication radii, in analogy with the threshold corrections of

n = 1 sectors of heterotic models [25].

the second check of consistency of (4.7) is to go into the transverse channel and check

that the uv divergences cancel. by using the modular transformation (a6) in (4.4), we

nd the amplitudes in the transverse channel

where, as in the previous section, we have explicitly displayed the contributions coming

from the exchange of ns-ns and the rr states. by performing a small b expansion in

(4.13), it can be checked that the uv divergence in the b2 term cancels, as expected, if

the tadpole consistency condition is imposed. more explicitly, the quadratic uv divergence

cancels provided

where the terms (trq4k) cancel exactly between the annulus and the mobius. the inter-

modes of the orbifold) appear at tree-level in the gauge kinetic function of the gauge group

and generate at one-loop (tree-level in the transverse, closed string picture) a tadpole.

therefore, the tree-level gauge couplings (2.11) become9

tensor. the relation (4.17) conrms the result conjectured [33] on the basis of spacetime

supersymmetry and anomaly considerations. notice that , even if the one-loop threshold

corrections in the ir (4.11) and the couplings (4.17) are separately non-universal (gauge-

group dependent), remarkably enough the coecients of the coupling of mk to the gauge

elds are proportional to the beta function coecients [41], shifting in a universal way the

string scale for zn odd orbifolds.

the anomalous u(1)x gauge factor has peculiar properties. fist of all, notice that the

result (4.17) applies to u(1)x as well. moreover, by introducing a background magnetic
eld b for it, coupled to the gauge group generator qu (1)x  qx, where for example
qx = (112, 04) in the case of the z3 orientifold, we nd a quadratic divergence

which is physically interpreted as a mixing between the u(1)x gauge eld and the ramond-

ramond axions (antisymmetric tensors c k

 in the string basis) in the tree-level lagrangian

[42]. in order to identify the coupling, we use the (gauge-xed) propagator

(4.19)

the u(1)x gauge boson becomes massive breaking spontaneously the symmetry, even for

zero vevs of the twisted elds mk. however, the corresponding global symmetry u(1)x

remains unbroken, since the fayet-iliopoulos terms vanish in the orbifold limit mk = 0 [44].

this property might be used in order to protect proton decay in low scale string models

[13], [14], [15].

notice that in the z3 case there is actually one linear (symmetric) combination of

twisted moduli (out of the 27 blowing up modes) which couples to the gauge elds, which

is the same appearing in the mixing between the rr axions and the anomalous u(1).

23

5. n = 1 supersymmetry: z6 and general models

the z6 model is dened by the twist vector v = (1/6,1/2, 1/3). the tadpole cancel-
lation conditions ask for 32 d9 branes and one set of 32 d5 branes lling the third compact

coordinate. the d5 branes are considered here to be all at the origin in the (z1, z2) plane for

simplicity, where (z1, z2, z3) denote the three complex compact coordinates. the solution

for the chan-paton matrices reads [6]

9 = 5 = diag (ei/6i4, e5i/6i4, ii8) .

(5.1)

the gauge group of this model is [u(4)  u(4)  u(8)]9  [u(4)  u(4)  u(8)]5 and the
charged matter representations are

99 or 55 :

(4, 4, 1) + (4, 4, 1) + (4, 4, 1) + (6, 1, 1) + (1, 6, 1) +

(1, 1, 28) + (1, 1, 28) + (1, 4, 8) + (4, 1, 8) + (4, 1, 8) + (1, 4, 8) ,

59 :

(1, 4, 1; 1, 4, 1) + (4, 1, 1; 1, 1, 8) + (1, 1, 8; 4, 1, 1) +

(4, 1, 1; 4, 1, 1) + (1, 4, 1; 1, 1, 8) + (1, 1, 8; 1, 4, 1) .

(5.2)

this model contains the n = 4 sector 0, n = 1 sectors coming from , 5 and n = 2
sectors coming from 2, 3 and 4.

our goal is the computation of the one-loop corrections to the gauge couplings coming

from the n = 1 and n = 2 sectors. then we will comment on the straightforward
generalization of these formulas for a generic four-dimensional n = 1 type i orientifold. for
this purpose, we choose the d9 brane gauge group and therefore we introduce a background

magnetic eld coupled to the d9 branes. in this case the relevant amplitudes to consider

are a99,a95 and m9. the other choice of turning on a magnetic eld in the d5 branes
sector can be obtained easily from the previous one by t-duality.

24

the one-loop open string amplitudes of this model with and without the background

magnetic eld are displayed in the appendix b. by collecting the results in appendix b

and performing a weak-coupling expansion similar to the one in section 3, we nd

orientifold is straightforward. a general such model contains in the spectrum d5i branes

lling the 4d spacetime and a compact complex dimension zi. dierent k sectors have

n = 1 and n = 2 supersymmetry, each one having a contribution as in (5.3). the last
line in (5.3) is replaced by the corresponding sum over 5i brane contributions.

taking the infrared limit in the above expression (5.3) allows to give a general formula

for the beta function coecient contributions of the various k sectors. by using the infrared

limits (4.8) and (a10) we nd

the various terms (b10)-(b13) in the transverse channel. the uv niteness of (5.3) is then

and the prime in the sum excludes the sectors k with 2kvi = integer for all i = 1, 2, 3, while

vi0 is the volume of the n = 2 complex torus ti0 in string units. the sectors k excluded
from the sum are associated to d5 branes and the corresponding twisted rr moduli are

4-forms in six dimensions; they belong to (neutral) hypermultiplets, which cannot couple

to the kinetic terms of non-abelian gauge elds, by virtue of n = 1 supersymmetry in 6d.
the remaining sectors fall in two categories: (i) n = 1 sectors corresponding to nontrivial
twists for all three planes with associated twisted moduli described by linear multiplets

in 4d; (ii) n = 2 sectors with no associated d5 branes and their corresponding (real)
moduli belonging to tensor muliplets in six dimensions containing also their rr 2-form

26

counterpart. the moduli of both categories (i) and (ii) can generally couple to gauge elds

according to (4.16).

let us illustrate this general result to the case of z6 orientifold. in this example, one

has n = 6 in (5.6) and the prime in the sum excludes the z2 sector k = 3 associated to 32

d5 branes.

we now describe the threshold corrections coming from n = 2 sectors in (5.3), using
the results of section 3. these corrections depend on the geometric moduli ti, ui dened

unlike the type i case, only the universal axion a is described by a linear multiplet, the

others tting naturally into chiral multiplets.

lets consider now the corrections given by an n = 2 sector, depending on the complex
torus of radii r1,2. notice that in the limit r1, r2   with r1/r2 = imu xed,
2  ln(r1r22), whereas in the limit r1  , r2 xed, the corrections are linearly
divergent 2  r1/r2. these power-law corrections can be used for the phenomenological
purpose of lowering the unication scale [15] in models with a low value of the string scale
mi [13, 14]. alternatively, if r1/r2  1 the logarithmic running 2  ln(r1r22) can also
be used in order to achieve unication at a high kaluza-klein scale, even if the fundamental

string scale has much lower values [17].

6. threshold corrections in models with spontaneous n = 4 

n = 2 supersymmetry breaking

type i string models with a continous parameter which interpolates between models

with dierent numbers of supersymmetries are an interesting framework for study threshold

corrections and their dependence on the interpolating parameter. in particular we show that

in the limit where the maximal supersymmetry is restored, there are no linear corrections in

the corresponding radius. the dependence is logarithmic only, which could be an advantage,

in the sense that the gauge hierarchy problem corresponding to these dimensions is improved

[18].

n = 4  n = 2 scherk-schwarz breaking

28

this model can be described in the closed string sector , as a freely-acting orbifold
iib/(1)mi, where (1)m denotes the order-two shift x 5  x 5 + r1 and i denotes
the inversion of the four internal coordinates ix 69 = x 69 [45] (a r1  2r1 operation
is required in order to go in the scherk-schwarz basis in which the amplitudes below

are written) . the resulting type i model [46] has n = 2 supersymmetry in 4d and a
gauge group so(n1)  so(n2) (with n1 + n2 = 32) originating from d9 branes and
can be described as a scherk-schwarz deformation (a shift of the kaluza-klein modes m1

with 1/2 unit along r1) of the n = 4 supersymmetric type i model with a wilson line
that breaks so(32) down to so(n1)  so(n2). n = 4 supersymmetry is recovered
in the r1   limit. the open string massless spectrum contains, besides the adjoint
n = 2 vector multiplets (n1(n1  1)/2, 1) + (1, n2(n2  1)/2), one hypermultiplet in
the representation (n1, n2).

in (6.1), m1(m2) denotes the kaluza-klein momentum sum along x 5(x 4) and (4) denotes

the momentum sum along t 4.

the introduction of the background magnetic eld is completely analogous to the cases

studied in the previous sections. by using the relations tr1 = n1 + n2, tr = n1  n2,
trq2 = 1 (plus sign for so(n1) and minus sign for so(n2) gauge factors) and by using

29

the last modular identity in (a8), we nd the threshold corrections

b(t) = 2[(n1  n2)  2](m1  m1+1/2) m2 ,

(6.2)

which in the ir limit agree with the eld theory beta-function coecients b1(so(n1)) =

2n1 + 2n2 + 4, b2(so(n2)) = 2n2 + 2n1 + 4. notice that, because of the remnant
n = 2 supersymmetry, the string oscillators decoupled in the nal expression, in analogy
with the n = 2 sectors of orbifold models, as shown in [28] and in section 3.

these corrections, in analogy with eq. (5.8), can be written in a more compact way in

the transverse channel

where u is the complex eld corresponding to the r1, r2 torus, g = r1r2 and e is the
euler number. in the r2   limit, r1 xed we get 2  r2/r1 and in the r1, r2  
limit we get 2  ln(r1r2), as expected. however, in the limit r1  , r2 xed,
corresponding to the limit of the restoration of the full n = 4 supersymmetry, we nd just
logarithmic corrections 2  ln r1, as in the dual heterotic models studied in [47]. the
corresponding threshold corrections on the heterotic side agree with (6.3), as expected, in

the th  i limit. notice that in (6.3) the uv divergence is automatically zero and does
not ask for the untwisted tadpole condition n1 + n2 = 32, in analogy with the previous

examples, because the untwisted tadpole condition is related to the n = 4 sector which
does not contribute to the threshold corrections to the gauge couplings. the uv niteness

holds to all orders in the magnetic eld b, which means that no tree-level modication of

the gauge kinetic function appears here, which is to be expected since there are no xed

points and therefore no twisted elds in a freely-acting orbifold.

n = 4  n = 2 m-theory breaking

30

this model is, in the closed string sector, the t-dual of the above one in the sense that it

exchanges the momentum modes and the winding modes along r1. the deformation shifts

now the winding modes along r1 with 1/2 unit and n = 4 supersymmetry is recovered in
the r1  0 limit. the model, which can also be seen by duality arguments as m-theory
compactied on (t 4  s1)/(z2  z2)  s2, contains, by tadpole consistency conditions, 16
d9 branes and 16 d5 branes, with a gauge group so(16) so(16). the massive spectrum
of the model has n = 2 supersymmetry, but the massless one has n = 4 supersymmetry
and consists of the vector multiplet in the adjoint representation of the gauge group. in

order to distinguish the two gauge factors in the following, we write the gauge group as

so(n)  so(d), where the tadpole conditions ask for n = d = 16.

(6.5)

and therefore there are no ir divergences. this is in agreement with the vanishing of the

beta function of the eective eld theory. the threshold corrections can be quantitatively

in the limit of the restoration of n = 4 supersymmetry r1  0, r2 xed, we nd a result
exponentially suppressed 2  er2/r1. this model has the property that the tadpoles are

31

locally cancelled in the compact direction r1. this can be understood by the fact that,

in the transverse channel, the annulus and the mobius amplitudes (6.4) have the same
winding lattice sum (1)nwn, while usually (in toroidal or orbifold compactications with-
out wilson lines) the transverse annulus contains the full lattice wn, while the transverse

mobius contains only the even windings lattice w2n. therefore not only the uv divergence

in (6.6) coming from the n = 0 mode is cancelled once the tadpole condition d = 16 is

imposed, but also simultaneously the contribution of the massive n modes, which describe

the position in the transverse (to the branes) space. the uv convergence holds at all

orders, for the same physical reason as in the model of the previous subsection.

7. eective eld theory

in the remaining two sections we discuss how our string-theory results could t (a) with

the general expressions of supergravity and (b) with the conjectured n = 1 heterotic/type
i duality, although there is no regime in which the 10d string coupling is small on both

sides. thus, we should warn the reader that this discussion is only tentative. our main

results will be (a) that the one-loop truncated supergravity expressions can be tted in the

special cases of z3 and z6 models and (b) that duality does not seem to work even in the

z3 example where the perturbative spectra on the two sides agree. these points deserve

denitely further study.

the starting point is the general (all-loop order) expression for the physical gauge

couplings ga in locally supersymmetric eld theories [48]:

expressed in terms of the wilsonian (holomorphic) gauge couplings fa and the wave-function

normalization matrix z(r) for the charged matter elds. here, mp is the planck mass,

k is the kahler potential, a denotes the gauge group factor and r runs over the gauge

32

group representations with dynkin index ta(r). the one-loop beta functions ba and the

coecients ca are given by

ba = xr

ta(r)  3ta(g) ,

ca = xr

ta(r)  ta(g) .

(7.2)

truncating the expression (7.1) to one-loop order requires the knowledge of the holomor-

phic gauge couplings fa at one-loop, while the kahler potential and the wave-function

normalization matrix need to be known only at tree-level. for simplicity, in the following

we concentrate on the gauge couplings originating from d9 branes. the holomorphic gauge

couplings and the kahler potential can be generally expanded as

fa = s + sakmk + f (1)

a (u) ,

k =  ln(s  s) + k(mk, t, u) ,

(7.3)

where u(t ) are the complex structure (kahler class) moduli elds and sak are numerical

constants given by (5.6). an important point is that in the wilsonian gauge kinetic function

fa the elds s, mk form complex chiral multiplets and that ims, immk are related to the

linear multiplet elds , mk (4.17), (4.16) in the string basis through a chiral-linear multiplet

duality [26]. notice that the twisted moduli mk can appear perturbatively only linearly

in fa because of the peccei-quinn symmetries associated to the ramond-ramond axions.

similarly, the only possible dependence of fa on t moduli is linear, but for d9 branes this

dependence vanishes. as we saw in the preceding sections, all linear dependence appears

only at the tree-level (disk diagram), while f (1)

a

is the genus one correction (5.10). inserting

eqs. (7.2) and (7.3) into (7.1), we nd

our goal here is to study the compatibility between the eective eld theory result (7.4)

and the string theory result (7.5) in the models z3 and z6 discussed in the previous sections.
we limit ourselves to the orbifold limit mk  0, where the string result is really valid. it
is instructive to review rst the situation in the heterotic case. the corresponding eective

eld theory and the heterotic string expressions can be obtained by putting sak = 0 and

immk = 0 in (7.4) and (7.5), replacing mi by the heterotic string scale mh and allowing

a dependence of the analytic one-loop corrections f (1)

i

on the kahler class moduli t [27].

this dependence turns out to be the sum imf (1)

a (t ) + imf (1)

a (u). indeed, unlike in type i

strings, in heterotic strings the t moduli are not protected by peccei-quinn symmetries.

more explicitly, the string expression becomes11

line of eld theory expression (7.4) combine to form ln(m 2

h/2), which reproduces the

corresponding term in the string expression (7.6). furthermore, a case by case analysis

11our notations are related to the function a of

ln(imtiimui).

(7.7)

where i

gs are gauge group independent constants. this apparent dierence (by a universal

term) between the two results can be explained psrtly by the fact that the string result

uses a linear multiplet for the dilaton l, instead of a chiral one s used in the eld theory

expression. indeed, the duality transformation that changes basis from the string to the

supergravity framework, brings a universal term proportional to the one-loop correction to

the moduli kahler potential [26]. as a result, the non-analytic part in y cancels out while

the coecients b(n =2)

ai

are shifted by the universal constants i

gs as in eq. (7.7).

we present in detail the explicit example of the z3 orbifold of the so(32) heterotic

string. the four-dimensional gauge group is su(12) so(8) u(1)x (the u(1)x factor is
anomalous). the charged massless chiral multiplets are in the representations 3(12, 8)1 +
3(66, 1)+2 from the untwisted sector and 27(1, 1)4 + 27(1, 8s)+2 from the twisted sector,
where the subscripts denote the u(1)x charge. in addition there are 9 neutral untwisted

(kahler class) moduli tij. in the following, for simplicity we consider only the diagonal
moduli tii  ti. since there are no n = 2 sectors, in the string expression (7.6)  =
0, b(n =2)
= 0 and there are no moduli dependent corrections to the wilsonian couplings

ai

f (1) = 0. on the other hand, in order to evaluate the eld-theory expression (7.4), we use

the results

where the index i in the untwisted matter labels the three dierent representations. notice

that in (7.4), by using the denitions (7.2) and (7.8), we can write

where the last sum in (7.9) is over the matter representations from the twisted sector.

moreover, by using the relation m 2

h = m 2

p /(ims)2, we conclude that the string scale in

35

(7.4) cancels between the rst line and the untwisted sector contribution of the second line.

therefore (7.4) becomes, for the two nonabelian gauge factors

(calabi-yau) blown-up z3 compactications where no twisted states are present in the

spectrum. in this case, the last term in the second eq. in (7.10) is absent and the resulting

expression coincides with the large volume limit of the string result [27]. notice that the

heterotic string scale disappears and the compactication volume plays the role of the

unication scale.

this is a linear-chiral multiplet duality12 for the twisted moduli, analogous to (7.12), per-

turbatively valid around mk = 0. the exact duality relation could depend on the complete

lagrangian for the twisted moduli and on higher-order corrections that we do not discuss

here. in analogy with the heterotic case, this result (7.15) is interpreted as a mixing be-

tween the twisted moduli mk and the untwisted ones s, ti, which could in principle be

checked by an explicit string computation.

the second, more involved, example, is the z6 orientifold. let us compare again the

string results obtained in section 5 and the eective supergravity. using (5.6) and (5.10)

notice that in the z3 case where the moduli m corresponds to n = 1 sectors twisted
with respect to the three complex planes, the linear-chiral multiplet duality (7.15) involves
in the z6 case on the other hand, where m2 corresponds to n = 2
sectors twisted with respect to the two-torii t 1, t 3 and untwisted with respect to t 2, the

the full volume.

linear-chiral multiplet duality (7.18) involves the volume of the twisted planes t 1, t 3.

our results on threshold corrections can be used to discuss heterotic - type i duality

which was conjectured to hold for some n = 1 4d vacua where perturbative spectra match,

38

even though there is no regime where both sides are weakly coupled and there are no bps

states to compare. the massless spectrum of the z3 case was described above (heterotic

side) and in section 4 (type i side). on the heterotic side there is an anomalous gauge factor

u(1)x [5] which forces the twisted matter elds (1, 1)4 to get a vev, breaking u(1)x and
giving superpotential masses to the 27 twisted charged elds (1, 8s)+2 [7]. these vevs

blow-up the heterotic orbifold singularities and the resulting heterotic massless spectrum

coincides with the one of type i at the orbifold point mk = 0. notice that the u(1)x

gauge eld on the type i side becomes massive without the need of any scalar vev [44],

and thus leaving unbroken the global u(1)x symmetry which has a counter part on the

heterotic side. after this blowing-up procedure, the heterotic threshold corrections are

given by the eld theory expression (7.10, 7.11), that does not depend on the heterotic

string scale, as explained in section 7. comparing this expression with the type i one-loop

threshold corrections at the orbifold point mk = 0 (7.13) one nds a disagreement since

the type i string scale appears explicitly. a possible explanation could be the existence of

non-perturbative corrections, depending logarithmically on the string coupling, on one of

the two sides which is necessarily strongly coupled. it is interesting to notice however that

if the vev of the type i twisted moduli were vanish in the chiral basis mk = 0, the two

one-loop results would match. in view of the relation (7.18), this would imply that the

orbifold point should be unstable on the type i side as well, due to higher order corrections,

which should induce a fayet-iliopoulos (fi) term for the anomalous u(1)x beyond one-

loop, depending on the compactication radii. this possibility seems though unlikely, in

view of the arguments of ref. [44].

8. anomalous u (1)s and gauge coupling unication

39

it is interesting to discuss in more detail the anomaly cancellation mechanism for the
anomalous u(1) factors in four-dimensional n = 1 orientifold models13. let us start for
simplicity with the z3 example discussed in section 4, where a linear symmetric combination

m of the 27 twisted moduli couples to the gauge elds

fa = s + sam ,

(8.1)

and the coecients sa were computed in (4.17). the model contains a single anomalous

u(1)x with the gauge generator qx = (112, 04) in a complex u(16) basis. under a u(1)x

gauge transformation with (supereld) parameter , there are cubic gauge anomalies. the

generalized green-schwarz mechanism requires a shift of the twisted moduli eld combi-

check of the anomaly cancellation mechanism. by supersymmetry arguments, we can also

(8.9)

in the above discussion, we neglected the additional complication of linear versus chiral

multiplet that arises from the change of basis of the type (7.15). although a detailed

analysis is needed to be done in the presence of several linear multiplets, it appears that

the gauge invariant combination entering in the kahler potential involves the scalar of the

linear multiplet mk instead of the chiral one mk, as in the expression of gauge couplings. we

will now show that, at least in the examples studied in this work, the linear combinations of

twisted moduli appearing in gauge couplings are the same with the combinations entering

in the anomalous u(1) d-terms. therefore, the vanishing of the latter at the point with

maximal gauge symmetry determines the vevs of the corresponding blowing-up directions

and removes the twisted moduli dependence of gauge couplings.

41

in fact, in the z3 case there is one anomalous u(1) with the corresponding fi term

proportional to the symmetric combination of the 27 blowing-up modes, which also appears

in the expression of gauge couplings, as discussed in section 4. requiring that the non-

abelian gauge group remains unbroken, the vanishing of the fi-term xes the symmetric

linear combination of the twisted moduli, removing the arbitrariness in the gauge couplings.

at the one-loop level, this selects the orbifold point mk = 0 [44] (or equivalently immk =

1

12c ln(v m 6

i )), implying that physical gauge couplings are moduli independent (up to one

loop) and unify at the string scale. on the other hand, if there are higher order corrections

that destabilize the orbifold vacuum and x the twisted moduli vevs at the point mk = 0

as discussed in the previous section, the unication scale would be determined by the size of

the compact space. this is an open important question that deserves further investigation.14

in the z6 orientifold, there are two linear combinations of twisted moduli elds entering

into the expression of gauge couplings (4.16), (5.6). on the other hand, the model has

two anomalous u(1)s in each of the d9 and d5 brane sectors. a simple inspection shows

that the vanishing of the corresponding fi terms (without breaking the non-abelian gauge

symmetry) xes both combinations appearing in the gauge couplings, removing again the

arbitrariness. at the one-loop level, this selects as before the orbifold point mk = 0. in this

example, the n = 1 sectors contribute to the running up to the type i string scale, while
the n = 2 sectors lead to threshold corrections depending on two compact tori, associated
to the two n = 2 sectors of the model (2 and 3). the issue of higher loop corrections is
similar to the previous (z3) example.

the situation simplies in the case of freely acting type i orbifold compactications [9,

46]. the couplings of the gauge elds to the twisted moduli and the presence of anomalous

u(1)s is determined by the (large or small radius) limit where supersymmetry is restored.

for instance, in all the examples studied in [9, 46], in particular in the ones discussed in

14 in ref. [35] it was assumed that the twisted moduli appearing in the gauge coupling are in the chiral

basis mk, with a non-vanishing vev, leading to a logarithmic volume dependence in the gauge couplings.

section 6, there are no anomalous u(1)s neither couplings to twisted moduli.

42

9. conclusions and discussions

the primary goal of this paper was the study of threshold corrections to the gauge

couplings in four-dimensional type i orientifolds. the method we use, developed in [28],

[17] consists in coupling a background magnetic eld b to the chan-paton charges of the

open strings and computing the quadratic terms b2 in a weak-eld expansion. we nd

that, in the n = 2 sectors of the orientifolds the string oscillators decouple and the result is
entirely due to kaluza-klein modes of the complex two-tori. this is in agreement with the

expectation that only bps states contribute to the threshold corrections in these sectors

[40, 28, 17]. for a rectangular torus of radii r1, r2 these corrections are proportional to

ln(r1r2) + f (r1/r2), where the function f diverges linearly f  r1/r2 in the r1 >> r2
limit. for phenomenological purposes, the linear term can be used in the accelerated

unication scenario of [15], while the logarithmic correction can acomodate for a more

traditional unication [17]. in the n = 1 sectors the string oscillators do not decouple
and the corrections are independent of the compact volume in the orbifold limit. by

identifying the string ir divergences with the eective theory running, a string formula for

the one-loop beta coecients of the eective eld theory was derived in (5.4). we showed

in section 6 that the dependence on the compact radii in models where supersymmetry is

spontaneously broken by compactication [9, 46] is milder. in particular, in the scherk-

schwarz model where the branes are parallel to the coordinate used to break supersymmetry

r1  , the linear behaviour is absent. on the other hand, in the m-theory model where
the branes are orthogonal to the breaking coordinate r1   (where r1 = 1/r1m 2
i is
the t-dual coordinate) the logarithmic corrections disappear as well and the thresholds are

exponentially suppressed er1r2m 2

i in the large radius limit, fact that could have interesting

phenomenological implications.

43

we explicitly computed the uv divergences in b4 in the one-loop open string ampli-

tudes, interpreted in the closed string channel as the propagation of the massless twisted

moduli mk coupling (at the disk level) to the gauge elds. by comparison of the two pic-

tures, we derived the explicit form of these couplings (4.16), (4.17), (5.6), rst discussed

in [33]. it turns out that the twisted moduli of all sectors (except the sector n/2 for n

even) generically couple to the gauge elds, fact that was also justied by supersymmetry

arguments in section 7. similarly we can couple a background magnetic eld b to the

anomalous u(1) factors. in this case, the b2 uv divergences in the open sector ampli-

tudes allowed us to single out the mixing of the rr twisted moduli with the anomalous

gauge elds (4.20). using these results, we discussed the fayet-iliopoulos terms for the

anomalous u(1) factors in section 8, as well as the generalized green-schwarz mechanism

[31] in section 7.

the method we used to obtain the above results for the d9 brane gauge groups can

be applied in a straightforward way to the d5 branes gauge groups, as well, by coupling a

background magnetic eld to the dirichlet strings. the dierence compared to d9 branes

is that the threshold corrections can depend only on the compact torus contained inside the

d5 branes world-volume, instead of the three torii available for the d9 branes. moreover,

the couplings (5.6) of the twisted moduli to the d5 gauge elds exist only for d5 branes

located at orbifold xed points and are nonvanishing only for twisted moduli living in the

xed point where the d5 brane is located.

we also performed a comparison between the one-loop corrected string gauge couplings

and the general eld theory results [48, 27]. this was done explicitly in the examples of

z3 and z6 orientifolds. we found that the two results dier by gauge group dependent

corrections, unlike the heterotic orbifolds, where the dierence is given by a universal term.

in the latter case, this dierence is explained by a chiral-linear multiplet duality (7.12)

for the dilaton multiplet, which involves the green-schwarz term related to the one-loop

44

correction to the kahler potential. in type i orientifolds, the compatibility between the two

results ask for specic chiral-linear multiplet duality relations (7.15), (7.18) for the twisted

moduli, which are described by linear (chiral) multiplets mk (mk) in the string (eld theory)

basis. this amounts to gauge group dependent corrections to the gauge couplings due to

the non-universal tree-level (disk) couplings of the twisted moduli to the gauge elds. in

analogy with the heterotic case, this requires loop corrections to the twisted moduli kahler

potential which would be interesting to be explicitly computed.

our results on threshold corrections were used to discuss in section 7 heterotic - type

i duality which was conjectured to hold for the z3 4d vacuum. comparing the threshold

corrections of the two sides we nd a disagreement which raises doubts on the perturbative

validity of the conjectured duality.

we nish by discussing the implication of our results on the unication of gauge cou-

plings. at the level of n = 2 compactications, in all orientifolds with the exception of
z2, the tree-level (disk) gauge couplings depend linearly on the vevs of twisted moduli

which correspond to exact at directions of the scalar potential. as a result, unication

is in general lost, although it is preserved in special examples (such as z3 in 6d), where

the coecients of these couplings are proportional to the (4d) beta-functions. in the latter

case, however, the unication scale is an arbitrary parameter, depending on the vevs of

the twisted moduli.

for n = 1 orientifolds, the generic presence of anomalous u(1)s xes the vevs of
the linear combinations of the twisted moduli that appear in gauge couplings, at least in

the examples we discussed in this work. at the point of maximal gauge symmetry, the

dependence on twisted moduli of gauge couplings vanish (up to one-loop order), and one

is left with the dependence on geometric moduli coming from the n = 2 sectors. as a
result, generically n = 1 sectors contribute to the running up to the type i string scale,
while the n = 2 sectors run up to the corresponding compactication radii. for low scale

45

string models, our results imply that the only way to achieve gauge coupling unication is

by using the running controled by the n = 2 beta-functions, that can be either power-like
or logarithmic.
