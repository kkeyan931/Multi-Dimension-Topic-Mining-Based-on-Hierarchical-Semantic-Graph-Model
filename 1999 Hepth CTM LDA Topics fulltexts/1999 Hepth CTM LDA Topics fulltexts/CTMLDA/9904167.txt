(1.7) noted that, special case = m, n = 0, i.e. degrees freedom bosonic, p (m|n) (1.5) becomes equivalent spin exchange operator ij pij appears hamiltonian (1.1). therefore, pure bosonic case, (1.7) would reproduce ferromagnetic polychronakos spin chain (1.1) = 1. similarly, case = 0, n = m, i.e. , degrees freedom fermionic, (1.7) would reproduce anti-ferromagnetic polychronakos spin chain (1.1) = 1. so, bosonic fermionic degrees freedom involved (i.e., n take nonzero values), may say h(m|n) (1.7) represents p hamiltonian su(m|n) supersymmetric polychronakos (sp) model. 3 article, aim study spectrum partition function dened su(m|n) sp model. end, sec.2, introduce appropriate extension spin calogero model (1.3), would generate sp model (1.7) freezing limit. section, also demonstrate spectrum extended spin calogero model essentially spectrum decoupled su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic oscillators, oscillator bosonic well n fermionic spin degrees freedom. way able show that, equidistant spectrum su(m|n) sp model (1.7) obtained simply modding spectrum su(m|n) harmonic oscillators spectrum spinless bosonic harmonic oscillators. subsequently, sec.3, derive partition function sp model (1.7) interestingly observe partition functions expressed novel q-polynomials. finally, obtain duality relation partition functions su(m|n) su(n|m) sp models. sec.4 concluding section. 2 spectra su (m|n) sp model related spin calogero model obtaining spectrum sp model, wish follow approach ref.8 nd rst suitable extension spin calogero model (1.3), would reproduce sp model (1.7) freezing limit. however, one immediate problem arises present spin calogero model like (1.3) rst quantised system, sp model (1.7) second quantised system. so, applying mentioned approach, convenient transform second quantised sp model (1.7) rst quantised spin system. end, consider special cases anyon like representations permutation algebra (1.6), used earlier constructing integrable exten- sions su(m) calogero-sutherland model well hs spin chain . 4 special cases anyon like representations dened action spin state like |12 n (with  ) p (m|n) ij |12 j n = ei(m|n)(i,i+1,,j) |12 j n , (2.1) (m|n)(i, i+1, , j) = 0 i, j , (m|n)(i, i+1, , j) = i, j , (m|n)(i, i+1, , j) = pm+n =m+1pj1 p=i+1 ,p  j  vice versa. clear p (m|0) reproduces original spin exchange operator pij p (0|m ) reproduces ij ij pij. next notice that, due constraint (1.4), hilbert space associated sp hamiltonian (1.7) spanned following orthonormal basis vectors: c11c22 cn n |0i, |0i vacuum state . so, possible dene one-to-one correspondence state vectors mentioned hilbert space state vectors associated spin chain |12 n c11c22 cn n |0i . (2.2) however noted that, matrix elements p (m|n) ij (2.1) p (m|n) ij (1.5) related  h12 n | pij|12 n = h0|cn n cn1, n1 c1 1 p (m|n) ij c11c22 cn n |0i, (2.3) may chosen possible ways. thus one nds that, anyon like representation (2.1) fact equivalent supersymmetric realisation (1.5). consequently, rst quantised spin hamiltonian given h (m|n) p = x1i<jn (cid:16) 1 p (m|n) (xi xj)2 ij (cid:17) , (2.4) would also completely equivalent second quantised sp model (1.7). par- ticular, hamiltonians (1.7) (2.4) would share spectrum eigenfunctions related correspondence (2.2). next, dene spin calogero model h (m|n) c = 1 2 n xi=1 2 x2 + 2x2 ! + x1i<jn l(cid:16) l p (m|n) (xi xj)2 ij (cid:17) , (2.5) 5 p (m|n) ij anyon like representation (2.1). special case = m, n = 0 (m = 0, n = m), hamiltonian reproduces su(m) spin calogero model (1.3) = 1 ( = 1). notice hamiltonian (2.5) rewritten h (m|n) c = h0 + l h (m|n) 1 , h0 hamiltonian spinless calogero model: h0 = 1 2 n xi=1 2 x2 + 2x2 ! + x1i<jn l (l 1) (xi xj)2 , (2.6) (2.7) 1 obtained h (m|n) h (m|n) tively. thus, operator h (m|n) p (2.4) replacing xi xj xi xj respec- 1 possesses spin particle degrees freedom. however, analogy case usual spin calogero model (1.3) , may consider freezing limit extended spin calogero model (2.5). freezing limit obtained setting l = hamiltonian (2.5) nally taking limit. evident that, freezing limit, particle spin degrees freedom hamiltonian (2.5) would decouple operator h (m|n) would transformed 1 pure spin hamiltonian xed values xis determined minima potential energy associated spinless calogero hamiltonian (2.7). since solu- tion eqn.(1.2) leads minima potential energy, operator h (m|n) 1 exactly reproduce sp hamiltonian (2.4) freezing limit. consequently, eigenfunctions spin calogero model (2.5) factorise eigenfunctions spin- less calogero model (2.7) containing particle degrees freedom su(m|n) sp model (2.4) containing spin degrees freedom. moreover, freezing limit, energy eigenvalues (denoted ep,s(), subscripts p represent particle spin degrees freedom respectively) full system (2.5) expressed ep,s() = ep() + es , (2.8) ep() es denote energy eigenvalues spinless calogero model (2.7) sp spin chain (2.4) respectively. clear eqn.(2.8) that, modding spectrum spin calogero model (2.5) spectrum spinless calogero model (2.7), one construct 6 spectrum sp model (2.4) (1.7). so, purpose obtaining spectrum sp model, essential nd rst spectrum spin calogero model (2.5). end, consider spinless calogero model distinguishable particles, described hamiltonian form h0 = 1 2 n xi=1 2 x2 + 2x2 ! + x1i<jn l (l kij) (xi xj)2 , (2.9) kij coordinate exchange operator: kij( , xi, , xj, ) = ( , xj, , xi, ). restricting action hamiltonian com- pletely symmetric wave functions, may recover spinless calogero model (2.7) indistinguishable particles. recently found that, using simi- larity transformations, one completely decouple particle degrees freedom calogero hamiltonians (2.7) well (2.9) . similarity transformations naturally lead ecient method calculating eigenfunctions spinless calogero models. particular, spectrum eigenfunctions h0 (2.9) obtained similarity transformation maps interacting hamiltonian system decoupled harmonic oscillators like hf ree = akak , n xk=1 (2.10) ak = 12 (cid:16)xk xk(cid:17) ak = 12 (cid:16)xk + xk(cid:17). mentioned simi- larity transformation explicitly given  s1 ( h0 eg ) = hf ree , eg = 1 2 n ( n l + (1 l) ) = g e 1 4 ol e 1 4 2 e 1 2 x 2 , x 2 = ol = n n x2 j , 2 = xj=1 xj=1 n 2 x2 j xj=1 + l xj6=k ( 2 |xj xk|l exp (xj xk)2 ) . kjk 1 xk!

(2.19) n 2 x 2 nondynamical spin degrees freedom. determine precise nature mentioned correlation, use relation (2.15) replace (m|n) n kij p (m|n) r.h.s. eqn.(2.19). finally, acting p (m|n) |12 n kij e 1 j=1 hnj (xj) , nd eigenfunction (2.19) free oscillators must (m|n) 2 x 2 n ij ij satisfy following symmetry condition simultaneous interchange related qn particle spin quantum numbers: n1,, ni,, nj ,, nn (x; ) = ei(m|n)(i,i+1,,j ) 1,, j ,, i,, n 1,, i,, j ,, n n1,, nj ,, ni,, nn (x; ) , (2.20) (m|n)(i, i+1, , j) phase factor appeared eqn.(2.1). clear eqn.(2.20) that, case i, j , eigenfunction 1,, i,, j ,, n n1,, ni,, nj ,, nn (x; ) remains completely unchanged simultaneous interchange particle spin quantum numbers. thus may treated bosonic quantum number, takes value ranging 1 m. next, using eqn.(2.20) case i, j , easy see 1,, i,, j ,, n n1,, ni,, nj ,, nn (x; ) would pick minus sign simultaneous interchange particle spin quan- tum numbers. therefore, eigenfunction 1,, i,, j ,, n n1,, ni,, nj ,, nn (x; ) must trivial choose ni = nj = j . thus may treated fermionic quantum number, takes value ranging + 1 + n. notice simultaneously interchange bosonic quantum number fermionic quantum number j ni nj, eigenfunctions satisfying 10 transformation relation (2.20) would either remain invariant pick minus sign depending whether even odd number fermionic spin quantum numbers present conguration: i+1i+2 j1. obvious that, special case = m, n = 0 (m = 0, n = m), 1, 2,, n n1, n2,, nn (x; ) (2.19) represents completely sym- metric (antisymmetric) eigenfunctions su(m) bosonic (fermionic) oscillators. so, case m, n 6= 0, may say correlated state vectors (2.19) would repre- sent eigenfunctions n number su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic oscillators. due existence symmetry condition (2.20), nd independent eigenfunctions su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic oscillators obtained uniquely following occupation number representation. since, present, spins be- nondynamical degrees freedom, single particle states occupation number representation may constructed taking m+n copies energy eigen- state associated spinless harmonic oscillator rst copies bosonic nature last n copies fermionic nature. usual, bosonic single par- ticle state occupied arbitrary number particles fermionic single particle state hold one particle. lling bosonic fermionic single particle states n number particles, easily identify inde- pendent eigenfunctions form (2.19). so, occupation number representation states (2.19) gives us convenient way analysing spectrum su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic oscillators. particular may verify that, similar pure bosonic fermionic case, spectrum su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic oscil- lators also equally spaced. but, interesting note that, ground state energy su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic oscillators coincides pure bosonic case, instead pure fermionic case. since number fermionic sin- gle particle states zero energy hold number particles, nonzero ground state energy obtained pure fermionic system n > m. however, least one bosonic single particle state zero energy available, state available particles. consequently nd that, irrespective values n, ground state energy su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic 11 oscillators would always zero. moreover, using mentioned occupation number representation, obtain degeneracy (dg) ground state su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic oscillators dg = n xk=0 (n + k 1)! n! (n k)! (m 1)! k! (n k)! . (2.21) worth observing degeneracy factor crucially depends values n, reproduces degeneracy ground state su(m) bosonic oscillators  special case = m, n = 0. similarly, one demonstrate degeneracy higher energy levels, appearing spectrum su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic oscillators, would also depend values n. due relation (2.18), acts nonsingular operator, exists one-to-one correspondence independent eigenfunctions spin calogero model (2.5) su(m|n) supersymmetric oscillators. consequently, constant energy shift (eg) energy levels, spectrum spin calogero model (2.5) ex- actly coincides spectrum su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic oscillators. however well known that, constant energy shift energy levels, spectrum spinless calogero model (2.7) exactly coincides spec- trum n number spinless bosonic harmonic oscillators. eigenvalues su(m|n) supersymmetric oscillators spinless bosonic oscillators depend linearly coupling constant , clear eqn.(2.8) used even nite value (though eigenfunctions spin calogero model (2.5) factorise freezing limit). moreover, since spectra su(m|n) supersymmetric oscillators spinless bosonic oscillators equally spaced, automatically follows eqn.(2.8) spectrum su(m|n) sp model (1.7) would also equally spaced choice n. natural expect that, similar case su(m|n) supersymmetric oscillators, degeneracy energy levels su(m|n) sp model (1.7) would crucially depend values n. so, interesting derive partition function sp model (1.7), information degeneracy factors encoded. 12 3 partition function su (m|n) sp model previous section observed that, similar pure bosonic case, ground state energy su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic oscillators would always zero. so, analogy pure bosonic (i.e., ferromagnetic) case , may put = 1 eqn.(2.8) subsequently use equation obtain relation like z (m|n) n (q) = z (m|n) (q) n z (1|0) n (q) , (3.1) (q) z (m|n) n (q) denote canonical partition functions q = e 1 kt , z (m|n) n su(m|n) sp model (1.7) su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic oscillators (where = 1) respectively. due mentioned notations, z (1|0) n (q) z (0|1) n (q) denote canonical partition functions n number spinless bosonic fermionic harmonic oscillators respectively. well known that, partition functions spinless bosonic fermionic oscillators given  z (1|0) n (q) = 1 (q)n , z (0|1) n (q) = q n(n1) 2 1 (q)n , (3.2) standard notation: (q)n = (1 q)(1 q2) (1 qn ) (and (q)0 = 1) used. so, calculating z (m|n) (q) help eqn.(3.1), nd n partition function n number su(m|n) supersymmetric oscillators. end, however, consider rst grand canonical partition function su(m|n) supersymmetric oscillators. grand canonical partition function may denoted z (m|n)(q, y), = e chemical potential system. so, according notation, z (1|0)(q, y) z (0|1)(q, y) denote grand canonical partition functions spinless bosonic fermionic harmonic oscillators respectively. usual, grand canonical partition function su(m|n) supersymmetric oscillators related corresponding partition function following power series expansion variable y: yn z (m|n) n (q) (3.3) z (m|n)(q, y) = xn =0 13 assumed z (m|n) 0 (q) = 1. previous section found that, independent eigenfunctions su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic oscillators obtained occupation number representation, corresponding single particle states constructed taking + n copies energy eigenstate associated spinless harmonic oscillator rst copies bosonic nature last n copies fermionic nature. exploiting result, easy prove grand canonical partition function su(m|n) supersymmetric oscillators expressed spinless bosonic fermionic oscillators z (m|n)(q, y) = h z (1|0)(q, y)imh z (0|1)(q, y)in . (3.4) next, substitute power series expansion (3.3) place grand canonical partition functions appearing equation. subsequently, compare coecients yn sides eqn.(3.4), readily nd canonical partition function su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic oscillators may also related spinless bosonic fermionic oscillators: z (m|n) n (q) = x ai+pn j=1 i=1 pm z (1|0) ai (q) yi=1 n yj=1 bj =n z (0|1) bj (q) , (3.5) ais bjs nonnegative integers. substituting known partition functions (3.2) spinless bosonic fermionic oscillators equation, one may obtain explicit expression partition function su(m|n) super- symmetric oscillators z (m|n) n (q) = x ai+pn i=1 pm bj =n j=1 bj (bj 1) 2 j=1 qpn (q)a1(q)a2 (q)am (q)b1(q)b2 (q)bn . (3.6) finally, using eqns.(3.1), (3.2) (3.6), derive exact canonical partition function su(m|n) sp model (1.7) z (m|n) n (q) = x ai+pn j=1 i=1 pm bj =n bj (bj 1) 2 j=1 (q)n qpn (q)a1(q)a2 (q)am (q)b1(q)b2 (q)bn . (3.7) 14 since, exists upper bound highest energy eigenvalue sp model (1.7), partition function z (m|n) (q) (3.7) evidently yields new q-polynomials n characterised values n. coecients various powers q, appearing novel q-polynomial, would represent degeneracy factors corresponding energy levels associated sp model (1.7). interesting note that, putting = m, n = 0 expression (3.7), one exactly reproduce partition function ferromagnetic polychronakos spin chain . hand, limiting case = 0, n = m, eqn.(3.7) would reproduce partition function anti-ferromagnetic polychronakos spin chain insignicant multiplicative factor. because, pure fermionic case, system harmonic oscillators spin degrees freedom gives nonzero ground state energy n > m. so, r.h.s. eqn.(3.1) must modied multiplicative factor taking account nonzero ground state energy . consequently expression (3.7) partition function, derived supersymmetric case (i.e., n nonzero), also modied factor pure fermionic limit. help relation: (q1)l = (1)l q l(l+1) 2 (q)l, nd partition function (3.7) sp model satises remarkable duality condition given z (m|n) n (q) = q n(n1) 2 z (n|m) n (q1) , (3.8) n may chosen nonzero integer. due duality condition, one write relation form d(m|n) n (e) = d(n|m) n n(n 1) 2 e! , (3.9) d(m|n) n (e) denotes degeneracy factor associated energy eigenvalue e su(m|n) sp model. moreover, using duality condition (3.8), along fact ground state energy hamiltonian (1.7) zero, easy show emax = n(n 1) 2 15 (3.10) represents highest energy eigenvalue su(m|n) sp model. context one may notice that, highest energy eigenvalue ferromagnetic anti-ferromagnetic su(m) polychronakos spin chain (1.1) given  emax = 1 2m n 2 t(m t) 2m , (3.11) = n mod m. thus curiously nd that, contrast case su(m) polychronakos spin chain (1.1), highest energy eigenvalue su(m|n) sp model (1.7) depend values n. obtaining insight mentioned dierence high- est energy eigenvalues (3.10) (3.11), nally consider motif picture, used analyse degeneracy eigenfunctions su(m) hs well poly- chronakos spin chain corresponding symmetry algebra . well known, motifs spin chains made binary digits like 0 1. moreover, spin chain n number lattice sites, binary digits would form motifs length n 1. write motif (a1a2 an1), ai  motif represents class degenerate eigenfunctions yield irreducible repre- sentation (glm ) yangian algebra . case su(m) polychronakos spin chain, energy eigenvalue corresponding (a1a2 an1) motif given  e(a1a2an1) = n1 xr=1 r ar . (3.12) however, case su(m) polychronakos hs spin chain, exists selection rule forbids occurrence number consecutive 1s motif. combining selection rule along eqn.(3.12), one derive highest energy eigenvalue (3.11) su(m) polychronakos model also understand eigenvalue crucially depends value m. worth noting that, mentioned motif picture also used analyse spectrum su(m|n) supersymmetric hs spin chain . but, supersymmetric case, exists selection rule binary digits like 0 1 chosen freely constructing motif length n 1. motivated case supersymmetric hs spin chain, 16 may conjecture motifs corresponding sp model (1.7) also free selection rule eqn.(3.12) gives corresponding energy eigenvalues. so, spectrum su(m|n) sp model contains 2n1 number motifs, constructed lling n 1 positions 0 1 possible ways. using eqn.(3.12), easy check motif (11 1) yields highest energy eigenvalue (3.10). thus absence selection rule, motifs corresponding sp model, turns main reason behind remarkably simple expression (3.10). 4 concluding remarks paper investigated spectrum well partition function su(m|n) supersymmetric polychronakos (sp) model (1.7) related spin calogero model (2.5). similarity transformation (2.11), maps spinless calogero model distinguishable particles decoupled oscillators, projection operator (2.16) played key role derivation spectrum spin calogero model (2.5). thus found that, constant energy shift states, spectrum spin calogero model exactly spectrum decoupled su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic oscillators. furthermore, using occupation number representation associated su(m|n) supersymmetric harmonic oscillators, obtained exact partition function spin calogero model. turned that, mentioned spin calogero model reproduces sp model (1.7) freezing limit. consequently, factoring contributions due dynamical degrees freedom spectrum well partition function spin calogero model (2.5), one compute spectrum partition function su(m|n) sp model. following procedure found that, similar non-supersymmetric case, spectrum su(m|n) sp model also equally spaced. however, degeneracy factors corresponding energy levels crucially depend 17 values n. result, get novel q-polynomials represent partition functions sp models. moreover, interchanging bosonic fermionic degrees freedom, obtain duality relation among partition functions sp models. future study, interesting nd lax operators con- served quantities su(m|n) sp model (1.7). moreover, parallel case su(m|n) haldane-shastry model , one might able show su(m|n) sp model also exhibits (gl(m|n)) super-yangian symmetry. super-yangian symmetry sp model may turn helpful analysing degeneracy patterns spectrum. however, information degeneracy patterns also encoded expression partition function (3.7). so, exist intriguing connection partition function (3.7) motif representa- tions super-yangian algebra. particular, partition function (3.7) might lead supersymmetric generalisation well-known rogers-szego (rs) polynomial. recursion relation among supersymmetric rs polynomials may used nd motifs representations degenerate multiplets associated super- yangian algebra. hope report supersymmetric rs polynomials related motifs forthcoming publication . acknowledgments like thank k. hikami many illuminating discussions. one authors (bbm) likes acknowledge japan society promotion science fellowship (jsps-p97047) supported work. 18
