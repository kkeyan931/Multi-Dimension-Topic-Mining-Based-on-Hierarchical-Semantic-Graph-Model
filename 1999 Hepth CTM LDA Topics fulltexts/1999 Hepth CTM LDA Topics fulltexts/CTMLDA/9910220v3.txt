abstract

in this paper we propose a new supersymmetric extension of conformal mechanics.
the grassmannian variables that we introduce are the basis of the forms and of the
vector-elds built over the symplectic space of the original system. our supersym-
metric hamiltonian itself turns out to have a clear geometrical meaning being the
lie-derivative of the hamiltonian ow of conformal mechanics. using superelds we
derive a constraint which gives the exact solution of the supersymmetric system in a
way analogous to the constraint in conguration space which solved the original non-
supersymmetric model. besides the supersymmetric extension of the original hamil-
tonian, we also provide the extension of the other conformal generators present in
the original system. these extensions have also a supersymmetric character being the
square of some grassmannian charge. we build the whole superalgebra of these charges
and analyze their closure. the representation of the even part of this superalgebra on
the odd part turns out to be integer and not spinorial in character.

1 introduction

more than 20 years ago a conformally-invariant quantum mechanical model was pro-
posed and studied in ref.[1]. recently that model has attracted again some interest
in connection with black-holes. it has been proven [2] in fact that the dynamics of a
particle near the horizon of an extreme reissner-nordstrm black-hole is governed in
its radial motion by the lagrangian of ref. [1]. this can be considered a manifestation
at the quantum mechanical level of the correspondence between gravity on ads and
conformal eld theory [3]. in this case it is the correspondence ads2/cf t1.

in 1983/1984 two groups [4] independently made a supersymmetric generalization
of conformal mechanics. it has been proved recently [2] that the motion of a super-
particle near an extreme reissner-nordstrm black-hole is governed by a relativistic
generalization of the supersymmetric conformal mechanics proposed in ref. [4]. so also
the supersymmetric version of conformal mechanics seems to hold some interest for
black-hole physics. for these conformal models (both for the original [1] and for the
supersymmetric one [4]) a nice geometrical approach was pioneered in ref. [5].

in this paper we will build a new supersymmetric extension of conformal mechan-
ics.
it is tailored on a path-integral approach to classical mechanics developed in
ref. [6]. the grassmannian variables which appear in this formalism are the basis of
the forms [7] and vector elds which one can build over the symplectic space of the
original conformal system. the weight in this path-integral provides what is known
as the lie-derivative [7] of the hamiltonian ow. this lie-derivative turns out to be
supersymmetric [6].

the reader may ask which is the dierence between our extension and the one of
ref. [4] which was tailored on the supersymmetric quantum mechanics of witten [8].
basically the authors of ref. [4] took the original conformal hamiltonian and added
a grassmannian part in order to make the whole hamiltonian supersymmetric. our
procedure and extension is dierent and more geometrical as will be explained later
on in the paper. one dierence for example is that while the equations of motion for
our bosonic variables are the same as those of the old conformal model [1], the analog
equations of ref. [4] have an extra piece. another dierence is that, once we use the
language of superelds, while we have to stick the supereld into the old conformal
potential [1] the authors of ref. [4] have to stick it into a potential which is derived from
the old conformal potential.

the paper is organized in the following manner: in section 2 we give a very brief
outline of conformal mechanics [1] and of the supersymmetric extension present in the
literature [4]; in section 3 we put forward our supersymmetric extension and explain its
geometrical structure. in the same section we build a whole set of charges connected
with our extension and study their algebra in details.
in section 4 we show that,

1

dierently from the superconformal algebra of [4] where the even part has a spinorial
representation on the odd part, ours is a non-simple superalgebra whose even part has
a reducible and integer representation on the odd part. nevertheless we can call it
a superconformal algebra because we have the charges which result from a combined
supersymmetry and conformal transformation. we think that the usual idea [12] which
says that a superconformal algebra has its even part represented spinorially on the odd
one applies only to relativistic systems and not to ours.
in section 5 we provide a
superspace version for our model and for the whole set of charges.
in doing that
we nd a new universal charge which is present always in our formalism [6] even for
non-conformal model. this new charge acts on the variables in such a manner as to
rescale the over-all lagrangian. this charge is not present in supersymmetric quantum
mechanics [4]. in section 6, using supereld variables, we provide an exact solution
of our model by giving a constraint in supereld space analogous to the one found for
conguration space in [1] and which provided the solution of the original conformal
system. we conne some calculations to a couple of appendices.

in this paper we do not have applications of our supersymmetric extension of confor-
mal mechanics to black-hole physics. we thought anyhow worth to write up these math-
ematical results because we feel that something deeply geometrical is behind the con-
nection conformal mechanics/black-holes or in general the correspondence ads/cft.
to grasp these geometrical issues it is better to use models where geometry is manifest
and beautiful and we believe ours has these features. we leave to others the task of
nding possible connection of our supersymmetric extension with black-holes.

2 conformal mechanics and its supersymmetric

extension

in this section we will briey review conformal mechanics [1] and its standard super-
symmetric extension [4].

the lagrangian proposed in [1] is

l =

1

2" q2 

g

q2# .

(1)

it is easy to prove that this lagrangian is invariant under the following transformations:

2

t =

q(t) =

;

t + 
t + 
q(t)

(t + )

;

with

   = 1;

(2)

(3)

(4)

which are nothing else than the conformal transformations in 0+1 dimensions. they
are made of the combinations of the following three transformations:

t = 2t
t = t + 
t

t =

t + 1

dilations,

time-translations,

special-conformal transformations.

the noether charges associated [1] to these three symmetries are:

g

q2! ;

1

h =

2 p2 +
1
d = th 
4
1
k = t2h 
2

(qp + pq);

t(qp + pq) +

1
2

q2.

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

using the quantum commutator [q, p] = i, the algebra of the three noether charges
above is:

[h, d] = ih;
[k, d] = ik;
[h, k] = 2id.

(11)

(12)

(13)

the fact that d and k do not commute with h does not mean that they are not
conserved. in fact what is true is that, as the h, d, k above are explicitly dependent
on t, we have:

d
t 6= 0;
dd
=
dt

k
t 6= 0;
= 0.

dk
dt

3

(14)

(15)

as the h, d, k are conserved, their expressions at t = 0 which are1:

h0 =

1

2"p2 +

g

q2# ,

[qp + pq] ,

d0 = 
1
k0 =
2

4
q2,

(16)

(17)

(18)

satisfy the same algebra as those at time t (see eqs. (11)-(13)). this algebra is so(2, 1)
which is known [11] to be isomorphic to the conformal group in 0 + 1 dimensions.

let us now turn to the supersymmetric extension of this model proposed in ref. [4].

the hamiltonian is:

hsu sy =

1

2 p2 +

g
q2 +

q2 [, ]!
g

(19)

where ,  are grassmannian variables whose anticommutator is [, ]+ = 1. as one
can notice, in hsu sy there is a rst bosonic piece which is the conformal hamiltonian
of eq.(1), plus a grassmannian part. note that the equations of motion for q have an
extra piece with respect to the equations of motion of the old conformal mechanics [1].
to make contact with supersymmetric quantum mechanics [8] let us notice that

hsu sy can be written as:

hsu sy =

=

1

=

2hq, qi+
2p2 + dw
dq !2

1

 [, ]

d2w

dq2 

where the supersymmetry charges are:

q =  ip +
q =  ip +

dw

dq ! ,
dq ! ,

dw

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

1the rhs of eqs.(16)-(18) is understood with p and q at t = 0 even if we do not put any subindex
(.)0 on them. moreover h0 and h have even the same functional form and so we will drop the
subindex (.)0 on h.

4

and w is the superpotential which, in this case of conformal mechanics, turns out to
be:

w (q) = g log q.

(24)

it is interesting to see what we obtain when we combine a supersymmetric transforma-
tion with a conformal one generated by the (h, k, d) elements of the so(2, 1) algebra
(11),(12),(13). we get what is called a superconformal transformation.
in order to
understand this better let us list the following eight operators:

table 1

h =

1

2hp2 +

[q, p]+

4

d = 
q2
k =
2
[, ]

;

b =

;

g + 2gb

q2

;

i;

2

g
q = hip +
q i;
g
q i;
q = hip +

s = q;
s = q.

the algebra of these operators is closed and given in the table below:

[h, d] = ih;
[q, h] = 0;
[q, k] = s;
[s, k] = 0;
[s, d] =  i
[q, q] = 2h;
[b, s] = s;

2 s;

[q, s] = g  b + 2id;

table 2

[k, d] = ik;
[q, h] = 0;
[q, k] = s;
[s, k] = 0;
[s, h] = q;
[s, s] = 2k;
[b, s] = s;
[b, q] = q;

5

[h, k] = 2id;
[q, d] = i
2q;
[q, d] = i
2q;
[s, d] =  i
2 s;
[s, h] = q;

[b, q] = q;

all other commutators are zero or derivable from these by hermitian conjugation. the
square-brackets [(.), (.)] in the algebra above are graded-commutators and from now on
we shall not put on them the subindex + or  as we did before. they are commutators
or anticommutators according to the grassmannian nature of the operators entering
the brackets.

as it is well known a superconformal transformation is a combination of a super-
symmetry transformation and a conformal one. we see from the algebra above that
the commutators of the supersymmetry generators (q, q) with the three conformal
generators (h, k, d) generate a new operator which is s.
including this new one
we generate an algebra which is closed provided that we introduce the operator b of
table 3. this is the last operator we need.

3 a new supersymmetric extension of conformal

mechanics

in this section we are going to present a new supersymmetric extension of conformal
mechanics. this extension is tailored on a path-integral approach to classical mechanics
(cm) developed in ref. [6]. the idea is to give a path integral for cm whose operatorial
counterpart be the well-known operatorial version of cm as given by the liouville
operator [9]. we will be brief here because more details can be found in [6].

let us start with a 2n-dimensional phase space m whose coordinates are indicated as
a with a = 1, . . . , 2n, i.e.: a = (q1, . . . , qn; p1, . . . , pn). let us write the hamiltonian
of the system as h() and the symplectic-matrix as ab. the equations of motion are
then:

a = ab h
b .

(25)

we shall put forward, as path integral for cm, one that forces all paths in m to sit
on the classical ones. the classical analog of the quantum generating functional is:

zcm[j] = nz d [(t)  cl(t)] exp(cid:20)z j dt(cid:21)

(26)

where  are the a  m, cl are the solutions of eq.(25), j is an external current and
e[.] is a functional dirac delta which forces every path (t) to sit on a classical one
cl(t). of course there are all possible initial conditions integrated over in eq.(26).

we should now check if the path integral of eq.(26) leads to the operatorial formu-
lation [9] of cm. to do that let us rst rewrite the functional dirac delta in eq.(26)
as:

6

(27)

. the

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) f
x(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)xi

[  cl] = [ a  abbh] det[a

b t  accbh]

where we have used the functional analog of the relation [f (x)] = [xxi]

determinant which appears in eq.(27) is always positive and so we can drop the modulus
sign |.|. the next step is to insert eq.(27) in eq.(26) and write the [.] as a fourier
transform over some new variables a, i.e.:

" a  ab h

b# =z da exp(iz a" a  ab h

b# dt) .

(28)

we then express the determinant det[a
as:

b taccbh] via grassmannian variables ca, ca

det[a

b t  accbh] =z dcadca exp(cid:26)z ca[a

b t  accbh]cbdt(cid:27) .

inserting the rhs of eqs. (28)(29) in eq.(27) and then in eq.(26) we get:

(29)

(30)

(31)

zcm [0] =z dadadcadca exp(cid:20)iz dtel(cid:21)

where el is:

el = a[ a  abbh] + ica[a

b t  accbh]cb.

one can easily see that this lagrangian gives the following equations of motion: for 
and c:

a  abbh = 0
[a
b t  accbh]cb = 0.

(32)

(33)

one notices immediately the following two things:

1) el leads to the same hamiltonian equations for  as h did;
2) cb transforms under the hamiltonian vector eld h  abbha as a form db does.
from the above formalism, using some extended poisson brackets (epb) dened in
the space (a, ca, a, ca) , one can get the equations of motion also via an hamiltonian

fh given by

fh = aabbh + icaac(cbh)cb.

7

(34)

the extended poisson brackets mentioned above are:

{a, b}ep b = a
b ;

{cb, ca}ep b = ia
b .
dta = {a,fh}ep b where a is one of the
the equations of motion are then given by d
variables (a, ca, a, ca) . all the other epb are zero; in particular {a, b}ep b = 0.
this indicates that the epb are not the standard poisson brackets on m which would
give {a, b}p b = ab.

being eq.(30) a path integral one could also introduce the concept of commutator
as feynman did in the quantum case.
if we dene the graded commutator of two
functions o1(t) and o2(t) as the expectation value h. . .i under our path integral of
some time-splitting combinations of the functions themselves as:

(35)

h[o1(t), o2(t)]i  lim

0ho1(t + )o2(t)  o2(t + )o1(t)i,

(36)

then we get from eq.(30) that the only commutators dierent from zero among the
basic variables are:

we notice immediately two things:

h[a, b]i = ia
b ;

h[cb, ca]i = a
b .

(37)

a) there is an isomorphism between the extended poisson structure (35) and the
graded commutator structure (37): {., .}ep b  i[., .];
b) via the commutator structure (37) one can realize a and ca as:

a = i


a ;

ca =


ca .

(38)

it is now easy to check that, using eq.(38), what we got as weight in eq.(30) corre-
sponds to the operatorial version of cm. in fact take for the moment only the bosonic

part of fh in eq.(34): fhbos = aabbh; this one, via eq.(38), goes into the operator
cfhbos  iabbha which is nothing else than the liouville operator of cm. so we got
what we expected. if we had added the grassmannian part to fhbos and inserted the op-

eratorial representation (38) of c, we would have got an operator which makes the evolu-
tion
like
f (, c) = fa1...apca1 . . . ca2. remembering that the ca transform as da (see point
(1) below eq.(33)), we can say that the function f (, c) can be put in correspondence
with p-forms:

in literature [7] as the lie-derivative of the hamiltonian ow. note that we are not
talking of forms built over the space (a, ca, a, ca) but only of forms over the space

so our fh makes the evolution of forms that means it corresponds to the object known
m whose coordinates are (a). our fh is the lie-derivative for this last space. via
our variables it is also possible to build vector and multivector elds over m and to
reproduce the full cartan calculus. for details we refer the reader to ref. [6] and for a
deeper geometrical understanding of our enlarged space (a, ca, a, ca) we invite the
interested reader to consult refs. [10].

the reader may remember that the concept of lie-derivative was mentioned also
in the second of refs. [8]. there anyhow the connection between lie-derivative and
hamiltonian was not as direct as here. moreover the lie-derivative was not associated
to the ow associated to the conformal potential but with the ow associated to the
superpotential (24).

the hamiltonian fh has various universal symmetries [6] all of which have been

studied geometrically. the associated charges2 are:

table 3

qbrs = icaa
qbrs = icaabb

qg = caca

abcacb

c =

2

abcacb

c =
nh = caah
n h = caabbh

2

using the correspondence between grassmannian variables and forms, the qbrs turns
out to be nothing else [6] than the exterior derivative3 on phase space and, as it is well
known [7] it always commutes with any lie-derivative. the qg, or ghost charge, is
the form-number which is always conserved by the lie-derivative. similar geometrical
meanings can be found [6] for the other charges that are listed above. of course linear

2the charges which here have been indicated as c and c are those that in ref. [6] were called k
and k. we change their names in order not to confuse them with the k operator of the conformal
algebra (see table 1).

3we denoted some charges as brs and anti-brs charges (qbrs,qbrs) because they are exterior
derivatives as the gauge-brs charges are and because they are nihilpotent and anticommutes among
themselves. the ab which appears in this table is the inverse of the ab of eq. (25).

9

combinations of them are also conserved and there are two combinations which deserve
our attention. they are the following charges:

(where  is a dimensionful parameter) which are true supersymmetry charges because,

qh  qbrs + n h;

(40)

qh  qbrs  nh;
besides commuting with fh, they give4:

(41)

[qh, qh] = 2ifh.

one realizes immediately that h acts as a sort of superpotential for the supersymmet-

this proves that our fh is supersymmetric. to be precise it is an n = 2 supersymmetry.
ric hamiltonian fh. all this basically means that we can obtain a supersymmetric
hamiltonian fh out of any system with hamiltonian h and, besides, our fh has a nice
we will now build the fh of the conformal invariant system given by the hamiltonian
of eq.(8), that means we insert the h of eq.(8) into the fh of eq.(34). the result is:

geometrical meaning being the lie-derivative of the hamiltonian ow generated by h.

(42)

fh = qp + p

g

q3 + icqcp  3icpcq g

q4

where the indices (.)q and (.)p on the variables (, c, c) replace the indices (.)a which
appeared in the general formalism. in fact, as the system is one-dimensional, the index
(.)a can only indicate the variables (p, q) and that is why we use (p, q) as index.
the two supersymmetric charges of eq.(40) are in this case

qh = qbrs +   g
qh = qbrs +   g

q3 cq  pcp!
q3 cp + pcq! .

(43)

(44)

it was one of the central points of the original paper [1] on conformal mechanics that
the hamiltonians of the system could be, beside h0 of eq.(16), also d0 or k0 of eqs.
(17)(18) or any linear combination of them. in the same manner as we built the lie-

ow generated by d0 and k0. we just have to insert5 d0 or k0 in place of h as

derivative fh associated to h0, we can also build the lie-derivatives associated to the
superpotential in the fh of eq.(34). calling the associated lie-derivatives as ed0 and
ek0, what we get is:

4the commutators used below are those of our path-integral for classical mechanics derived in

eq.(37).

5we will neglect ordering problem in the expression (17) of d0 because we are doing a classical

theory. the sub-index (.)0 that we will put on ed and ek below is to indicate that they were built

from the d0 and k0.

(45)

(46)

the construction is best illustrated in figure 1.

as it is easy to prove, both ed0 and ek0 are supersymmetric. it is possible in fact to

introduce the following charges:

qd = qbrs + (qcp + pcq);
qd = qbrs + (pcp  qcq);
qk = qbrs  qcq;
qk = qbrs  qcp;

( and  play the same role as  for h) which close on ed0 and ek0:

[qd, qd] = 4ied0
[qk, qk] = 2iek0.

11

(47)

(48)

(49)

(50)

(51)

(52)

one further point to notice is that the conformal algebra of eqs.(11)(12)(13) is now

realized, via the commutators (37) of our formalism, by the (fh, ed0, ek0) and not by the

old functions (h, d0, k0). in fact, via these new commutators, we get:

[fh, ed0] = ifh;

[h, d0] = 0;

[ek0, ed0] = iek0;

[k0, d0] = 0;

[fh, ek0] = 2ied0;

[h, k0] = 0.

(53)

(54)

the next thing to nd out, assuming as basic hamiltonian the fh and as supersym-

metries the ones generated by qh and qh, is to perform the commutators between
supersymmetries and conformal operators so to get the superconformal generators. it
is easy to work this out and we get:

[qh, ed0] = i(qh  qbrs);
[qh, ek0] =
(qd  qbrs);

i


[qh, ed0] = i(qh  qbrs);
[qh, ek0] =
(qd  qbrs).

i


(55)

(56)

from what we have above we realize immediately the role of the qd and qd: besides

being the square roots of ed0 they are also (combined with the qbrs and qbrs) the

generators of the superconformal transformations.
it is also a simple calculation to
evaluate the commutators between the various supercharges qh,qd, qk, qh, qd,
qk:

[qh, qd] = ifh + 2ied0  2h;
[qk, qd] = iek0 + 2ied0 + 2k0;
[qh, qk] = ifh + iek0  2d0;

[qh, qd] = ifh + 2ied0 + 2h;
[qk, qd] = iek0 + 2ied0  2k0; (58)
[qh, qk] = ifh + iek0 + 2d0;

(59)

(57)

from the rhs of these expressions we see that one needs also the old functions
(h, d0, k0) in order to close the algebra.

the complete set of operators which close the algebra is listed in the following table:

we notice than for our supersymmetric extension we need 14 charges (see table 4)
in order for the algebra to close, while in the extension of ref. [4] one needs only 8 charges
(see table 1). this is so not only because ours is an n = 2 supersymmetry (while
the one of [4] is an n = 1) but also because of the totally dierent character of the
model.

4 study of the two superconformal algebras

a lie superalgebra [12] is an algebra made of even en and odd o generators whose
graded commutators look like:

[em, en] = f p
[em, o] = g
[o, o] = c m

mnep;
mo;
em;

(60)

(61)

(62)

mn, g

m,, c m

and where the structure constants f p

, satisfy generalized jacobi identities.
one can interpret the relation (61) as saying that the even part of the algebra has
a representation on the odd part. this is clear if we consider the odd part as a vector
space and that the even part acts on this vector space via the graded commutators.
the structure constants f 
m are then the matrix elements which characterize the rep-
resentations.

for superconformal algebras the usual folklore says that the even part of the algebra
has his conformal subalgebra represented spinorially on the odd part. the reasoning
roughly goes as follows: the odd part of the algebra must contain the supersymmetry
generators which transform as spinors under the lorentz group which is a subgroup
of the conformal algebra. so it is impossible that the whole conformal algebra is
represented non-spinorially on the odd part.

actually this line of reasoning is true in a relativistic context in which the supersym-
metry is a true relativistic supersymmetry and the charges must carry a spinor index
due to their nature. in our non-relativistic point particle case instead the charges do
not carry any space-time index and so we do not have as a consequence that necessarily
the even part of the algebra is represented spinorially on the odd part. it can happen
but it can also not happen. in this respect we will analyze the superalgebras of the two
supersymmetric extensions of conformal mechanics seen here, the one of [4] and ours.

6the q(...) appearing in the table can be any of the following operators: qbrs,qh,qd,qk and the
same holds for q(...). obviously all commutators are between quantities calculated at the same time.

14

let us start from the one of ref. [4] which is given in table 1. the conformal

subalgebra g0 of the even part can be organized in an so(2, 1) form as follows:

b1 =
b2 = d

j3 =

2(cid:20) k
a  ah(cid:21)
2(cid:20) k
+ ah(cid:21)

g0 :



where a is the same parameter introduced in [1] with dimension of time.

the odd part g1 is:

q

it is easy to work out, using the results of table 2, the action of the g0 on g1. the
result is summarized in the following table:

[b1, q] =

as we said before, in order to act with the even part of the algebra on the odd part,
we have to consider the odd part of the as a vector space. let us then introduce the
following vectors:

|qi  q + q
|pi  s  s
|ri  q  q
|si  s + s;

15

(63)

(64)

(65)

(66)

they label a 4-dimensional vector space. on these vectors we act via the commutators,
for example:

b1|qi  [b1, q + q]

(67)

it is then immediate to realize from table 6 that the 2-dim.
space with basis
(|qi,|pi) form a closed space under the action of even part of the algebra so it carries a
2-dim. representation and the same holds for the space (|ri,|si). we can immediately
check which kind of representation is this: let us take the casimir operator of the
algebra g0 which is c = b2

representations:

sentation. it is possible to prove the same for the other space.

let us now turn the same crank for our supersymmetric extension of conformal
mechanics. looking at the table 4 of our operators, we can organize the even part
g0, as follows:

table 7 (g0)

b1 =

2  ek

b2 = ed;

the lhs is the usual so(2, 1) while the rhs is formed by three translations because
they commute among themselves. so the overall algebra is the euclidean group e(2, 1).
the odd part of our superalgebra is made of 8 operators (see table 4) which are:

qh;

as we did before in table 6 for the model of [4], we will now evaluate for our model
the action of g0 on g1. the result is summarized in the next table:

[b1, qh] =

[b2, qh] = i(qbrs  qh);
[b2, qk] = i(qk  qbrs);

[p2, q(...)] = 1(qh  qk);
[p0, q(...)] = 1(qh + qk  2qbrs);
where for simplicity we have made the choice a =s 
as we have to represent the conformal subalgebra of g0 (see table 7) on the
vector space g1 of table 8 it is easy to realize from table 9 that the following
three vectors

and

(69)

in fact, using

(70)

b1|qhi =  i
2|qdi
b2|qhi = i|qhi
j3|qhi =  i
2|qdi
b1|qki =  i
2|qdi
b2|qki = i|qki
j3|qki = i
2|qdi
b1|qdi = i(|qhi + |qki)
b2|qdi = 0
j3|qdi = i(|qhi  |qki).



|qhi = (qh  qbrs)  (qh  qbrs)
|qki = (qk  qbrs)  (qk  qbrs)
|qdi = 1[(qd  qbrs)  (qd  qbrs)]



make an irreducible representation of the conformal subalgebra.
table 9, we get:

having three vectors in this representation we presume it is an integer spin represen-
tation, but to be sure let us apply the casimir operator on a vector. the casimir is
given, as before, by: c = b2
3 but we must remember to use as b1, b2 and
j3 the operators contained in table 7. it is then easy to check that

2  j 2

1 + b2

c|qhi = 2|qhi.

(71)

the same we get for the other two vectors |qki,|qdi, so the eigenvalue in the equa-
tion above is 2 = 1(1 + 1) and this indicates that those vectors make a spin 1
representation.

in the same way as before it is easy to prove that these other three vectors:



|fqhi = (qh  qbrs) + (qh  qbrs)
|fqki = (qk  qbrs) + (qk  qbrs)
|fqdi = (qd  qbrs) + (qd  qbrs)

make another irreducible representation of spin 1.

(72)

of course, as the vector space g1 of table 8 is 8-dimensional and up to now
we have used only 6 vectors to build the two integer representations, we expect that
there must be some other representations which can be built using the two remaining
vectors. it is in fact so. we can build the following two other vectors:

and it is easy to see that each of them carry a representation of spin zero:

|qbrsi = qbrs  qbrs
| gqbrsi = qbrs + qbrs
c|qbrsi = c| gqbrsi = 0

18

(73)

(74)

(75)

so we can conclude that our vector space g1 carries a reducible representation of the
conformal algebra made of two spin one and two spin zero representations.

we wanted to do this analysis in order to underline a further dierence between our
supersymmetric extension and the one of [4] whose odd part g1, as we showed before,
carries two spin one-half representations.

one last thing to do is to nd out to which of the superalgebras classied in the

literature ours belongs. we will come back to this in the future.

5 superspace formulation of the model

it is easy and instructive to do a superspace formulation of our model like the authors

of ref.[4] did for theirs.

let us enlarge our base space (t) to a superspace (t, , ) where (, ) are grass-
mannian partners of (t). it is then possible to put all the variables (a, ca, a, ca) in a
single supereld  dened as follows:

a(t, , ) = a(t) + ca(t) +  abcb(t) + i abb(t)

(76)

this supereld had already been introduced in ref.[6]. it is a scalar eld under the
supersymmetry transformations of the system. the various factors of i appearing in
its denition are due to the fact that we chose [6] the ca, ca to be real and the ,  to
be pure imaginary.

it is a simple exercise to nd the expansion of any function f (a) of the superelds
in terms of , . for example, choosing as function the hamiltonian h of a system, we
get:

h(a) = h() + nh   n h + i  fh

where nh and n h and fh are those given in table 3 and in eq.(34).

from eq.(77) it is easy to prove that:

(77)

(78)

here we immediately notice a crucial dierence with the supersymmetric qm model of
ref.[4]. in the language of superelds (see the second of ref. [4]) those authors obtain
the supersymmetric potential of their hamiltonian by inserting the supereld into the
superpotential (which is given by eq.(24)) and integrating in something like , , while
we get the potential part of our supersymmetric hamiltonian by inserting the supereld
into the normal potential of the conformal mechanical model given in (16).

iz h() dd = fh

19

the space (a, ca, a, ca) somehow can be considered as a target space whose base
space is the superspace (t, , ). the action of the various charges listed in our
table 4 is on the target-space variables but we can consider it as induced by some
transformations on the base-space.
if we collectively indicate the charges acting on
(a, ca, a, ca) as , we shall indicate the generators of the corresponding transforma-

tions on the base space as b. the relation between the two is the following:

where

a = ba

a = [, a]

with  the commuting or anticommuting innitesimal parameter of our transforma-
tions7 and [(.), (.)] the graded commutators of eq.(37).

using the relations above it is easy to work out the superspace representation of the

operators contained in table 3, they are given in the table below:

table 10

bqbrs = 
bqbrs = 
bqg =   
bc = 
bc = 
cnh = t
cn h = t

via the charges above it is immediate to write down also the supersymmetric charges
of eq.(40):

(79)

(80)

(81)

(82)

their anticommutator gives:

bqh =    t;

bqh =  +  t;

7the conventions (79) and (80) are slightly dierent than the ones in ref. [6]. here we also correct

[bqh, bqh] = 2


t

some misprints present in that reference.

20

from which, comparing the above equation with eq.(41), one gets the superspace rep-

resentation of fh:


t

.

(83)

cfh = i

proceeding in the same way, via the relations (79), (80), it is a long but easy procedure
to give a superspace representation to the charges qd, qd, qk, qk of eqs. (47)-(50).
this long derivation is contained in the appendix and the result is:


   adkdb 
+  adkdb 


 

  2 adddb 
+ 2 adddb 


 

bqk = 
bqk =
bqd = 
bqd =
0 0 ! ;
kdb =  1 0

2  0 1
1 0 !

ddb = 

where the matrices kdb and ddb are:

(84)

(85)

(86)

(87)

(88)

(the repeated indices in eqs.(84)-(87) are summed). the matrices kdb and ddb are
2  2 just because the symplectic matrix itself ab is 2  2 in our case. the conformal
mechanics system in fact has just a pair of phase-space variables (p, q) and the index
in the a-phase space variables can take only 2 values to indicate either q or p (see the
eqs. of motion (25)).

from the expressions of bqk, bqk, bqd, bqd above we see that they have two free indices.

this implies (see eq.(79)) that those operators turn the various superelds in the
sense that they turn a q into combinations of q and p and viceversa. this is
something the other charges did not do.

reached this point, we should stop and think a little bit about this superspace repre-
the various charges

we gave the superspace

representation of

sentation.

these last quantities were built using the d0 and k0 that is the d and k at t = 0. if we

(qd, qd, qk, qk) of eqs.(47)-(50) which were linked to the ed0, ek0 of eqs.(45)(46). but
had used, in building the ed0, ek0, the d and k at t 6= 0 of eqs.(9) and (10), we would
have obtained a ed and a ek dierent from those of eqs.(45)(46) and which would have

had an explicit dependence on t. consequently also the associated supersymmetric
t
charges (qt
k), having extra terms depending on t, would be dierent from
k, q
those of eqs.(47)-(50). being these charges dierent, also their superspace representa-
tions shall be dierent from those given in eqs.(84)-(87). the dierence at the level of
superspace is crucial because it involves t which is part of superspace.

t
d, qt
d, q

21

let us then start this over-all process by rst building the explicitly t-dependent ed
and ek from the following operators d and k:

from which we get:

h = h0
d = th + d0
k = t2h + 2td0 + k0

ed = tfh + ed0
ek = t2fh + 2ted0 + ek0.

(89)

(90)

(91)

(92)

(93)

it is easy to understand why these relations hold by remembering the manner we got

the lie-derivatives out of the superpotentials. the explicit form of ed in terms of
(a, ca, a, ca) can be obtained from (92) once we insert the fh and ed0 whose explicit
form we already had in eqs.(42) and (45). the same for ek. let us now turn to the

t
t
form of the associated fermionic charges which we will indicate as (qt
k, q
d, q
k)
where the index (.)t is to indicate their explicit dependence on t. as it is shown in
formula (a.1) of appendix a, the qd and qk can be written using the charges nd
and nk of (a.2) and the qbrs. as it is only the n(...) and not the qbrs which pull in
quantities like d, k which may depend explicitly on time, we should only concentrate
on the n(...). from their denition (see eq.(a.2)):

d, qt

nd = caad;

nk = caak

we see that applying the operator caa on both sides of eqs.(90)(91), we get:

n t
n t

d = tnh + nd
k = t2nh + 2tnd + nk.

(94)

(95)

(96)

the next step is to write the qt
d and qt
that equation and (95)(96) above we get:

k. as they are given in formula (a.1), using

qt
d = qbrs  2n t
k = qbrs  n t
qt
k.

d

22

(97)

(98)

in a similar manner, via eq.(a.9) and applying the operator caabb to eqs.(90)(91),
t
t
we get the q
d and q
k:

t
d = qbrs + 2n
q
t
t
k = qbrs + n
k.

(99)

(100)

t

we shall not write down explicitly the expressions of (qt
k) in terms of
d, q
k, q
(a, ca, a, ca) because we have already in eqs.(47)-(50) and (a.2)(a.9) the expressions8
of the various charges (qd, qk, qd, qk, nd, nk, n k, n d) which make up, according
to eqs.(97)-(100), the new time dependent charges. the next step is to obtain the
t
t
superspace version of (qt
k, q
d, q
k). following a procedure identical to the one
explained in detailed in the appendix for the time-independent charges it is easy to get

d, qt

them and, via their anticommutators, to derive the superspace version of the ed and
ek. all these operators are listed in the table below:

(101)

the reasons for the presence of these two-dimensional matrices has been explained in
the paragraph below eq.(88).

the last three operators listed in table 11 are the superspace version of the
old (h, d, k). to get this representation we used again and again the rules given by
eqs.(79)(80). as their representation looks quite unusual, we have reported the details
of their derivations in appendix b.

we want to conclude this section by presenting a new symmetry of our system. a
symmetry which is not among those found up-to-now whose charges we have listed in
table 4. it is associated with the following superspace operator:

this operator is very similar to the ghost-charge qg of table 10 but it has a crucial
sign dierence.




+ 


 

.

(102)

bqs = 

let us apply it on the rhs of eq.(79) and see which variation it induces on the

(a, ca, a, ca) :

qs a = bqsa = (ca + abcb + 2iabb).

comparing the components with the same number of  and  on both side of the
equation above, we get

(103)

qs a = 0
qs ca = ca
qs ca = ca
qs a = 2a.

(104)

(105)

(106)

(107)

it is easy to check how the lagrangian of our model (see eq.(31)) changes under the
variations above:

we can conclude that the transformations induced by bqs on the (a, ca, a, ca) are a

symmetry of our system. in fact they just rescale the overall lagrangian so they keep
the equations of motion invariant and these qualies them as symmetry transforma-
tions. of course they are non-canonical symmetries because the rescaling of the whole

(108)

qs el = 2el.

24

lagrangian is not a canonical transformation in (a, ca, a, ca) . as it is not canonical

we cannot nd a canonical generator in (a, ca, a, ca) associated to bqs. note that the
above is a symmetry of any el not necessarily of the conformal model we have analyzed

here. we could ask if this was a symmetry also of the susyqm model of witten [8]
or at least of the conformal qm of ref. [4]. the answer is no!, the technical reason
being that in those qm models the analogs of the a variables enter the lagrangian

with a quadratic term while in our el they enter linearly. there is also an important

physical reason why that symmetry was not present in those qm models while it was
present in our cm one. the reason is that in qm one cannot rescale the action (as
our symmetry does) because there is the h setting a scale for the action, while it can
be done in cm where no scale is set. the reader may object that our transformation
rescales the lagrangian but not the action

s =z el dt

(109)

because one could compensate the rescaling of the el with a rescaling of t. that is not

so because our qs transforms only the grassmannian partners of time (, ) and not
time itself.

we will come back to this symmetry in the future because it seems to be at the heart

of the dierence between qm and cm.

6 exact solution of the supersymmetric model

the original conformal mechanical model was solved exactly in eq.(2.35) of reference
[1]. the solution is given by the relation:

q2(t) = 2t2h  4td0 + 2k0.

(110)

as (h, d0, k0) are constants of motion, once their values are assigned we stick them
in eq. (110), and we get a relation between q (on the lhs of (110) ) and t on the
rhs. this is the solution of the equation of motion with initial conditions given by
the values we assign to the constants of motion (h, d0, k0). the reader may object
that we should give only two constant values (corresponding to the initial conditions
(q(0), q(0))) and not three. actually the three values assigned to (h, d0, k0) are not
arbitrary because, as it was proven in eq.(2-36) of ref. [1], these three quantities are
linked by a constraint:

(cid:16)hk0  d2

0(cid:17) =

g
4

25

(111)

where g is the coupling which entered the original hamiltonian (see eq.(1) of the
present paper). having one constraint among the three constants of motion brings
them down to two.
the proof of the relation (110) above is quite simple. on the rhs, as the (h, d0, k0)
are constants of motion, we can replace them with their time dependent expression
(h, d, k) (see eq.(89)-(91)), which are explicitly:

h =

1

2  q2(t) +

g

q2(t)!

1
2

q(t) q(t)

d = th 
k = t2h  t q(t) q(t) +

(112)

(113)

(114)

1
2

q2

inserting these expressions on the rhs of eq.(110) we get immediately the lhs. from
the eqs.(112)-(114) it is also easy to see the relations between the initial conditions
(q(0), q(0)) and the constants (h, d0, k0); in fact:

h = h(t = 0) =

1

2  q2(0) +

g

q2(0)!

d = d0 = 
1
k = k0 =
2

1
2
q2(0).

(q(0) q(0))

(115)

(116)

(117)

from the relations above we see that, inverting them, we can express (q(0), q(0)) in term
of (h, d0, k0). the constraint (111) is already taken care by the form the (h, d0, k0)
have in terms of (q(0), q(0)).

what we want to do in this section is to see if a relation analogous to (110) exists
also for our supersymmetric extension or in general if the supersymmetric system can
be solved exactly. the answer is yes and it is based on a very simple trick.

let us rst remember eq. (78) which told us how fh and h are related:

(118)

iz h() dd = fh

the same relation holds for ed0 and ek0 with respect to d0 and k0 as it is clear from

the explanation given in the paragraph above eqs.(45)(46):

iz d0() dd = ed0

26

(119)

iz k0() dd = ek0.

(120)

of course the same kind of relations holds for the explicitly time-dependent quantities
of eqs.(90)-(93):

iz d() dd = ed
iz k() dd = ek.

let us now build the following quantity:

2t2h()  4td() + 2k()

(121)

(122)

(123)

this is functionally the rhs of eq.(110) with the supereld a replacing the normal
phase-space variable a. it is then clear that the following relation holds:

(q)2 = 2t2h()  4td() + 2k()

(124)

the reason it holds is because, in the proof of the analogous one in q-space (eq.(110)),
the only thing we used was the functional form of the (h, d, k) that was given by
eq.(112)-(114). so that relation holds irrespective of the arguments,  or , which
enter our functions provided that the functional form of them remains the same.
let us rst remember the form of q which appears9 on the lhs of eq.(124):

q(t, , ) = q(t) +  cq(t) + qpcp(t) + i qpp(t).

(125)

let us now expand in  and  the lhs and rhs of eq.(124) and compare the terms
with the same power of  and .

the rhs is

(q)2 = q2(t) + [2q(t)cq(t)] + [2q(t)cp(t)] + [2iq(t)p(t) + 2cq(t)cp(t)].

(126)

the lhs is instead:

9the index (.)q is not a substitute for the index a but it indicates, as we said many times before,
the rst half of the indices a. let us remember in fact that the rst half of the a are just the
congurational variables qi which in our case of a 1-dim. system is just one variable.

these

d, n t

(h, d, k, n(...), n (...),fh, ek, ed) are conserved and constants of motion in the enlarged

space (a, ca, a, ca) .

if we now compare the rhs of eq.(126) and eq.(127) and equate terms with the

same power of  and , we get (by writing the n and n explicitly):

(127)

(128)

(129)

(130)

(131)

q2(t) = 2t2h()  4td() + 2k();
a# ca;
a# abcb;

2q(t)cp(t) = "2t2 h

i2q(t)p(t) + 2cq(t)cp(t) = ih2t2fh  4ted + 2eki .

we notice immediately that eq.(128) is the same as the one of the original paper [1]
and solves the motion for q. given this solution we plug it in eq.(129) and, as on the
rhs we have the n-functions which are constants, once these constants are assigned
we get the motion of cq. next we assign three constant values to the n-functions which
appear on the rhs of eq.(130), then we plug in the solution for q given by eq.(128)
and so we get the trajectory for cp. finally we do the same in eq.(131) and get the
trajectory of p.

the solution for the momentum-quantities (p, cp, cq, q) can be obtained via their

denition in terms of the previous variables.

the reader may be puzzled by the fact that in the space (a, ca, a, ca) we have 8

variables but we have to give 12 constants of motion: (h, d0, k0, n(...), n (...),fh, ek, ed)

to get the solutions from equations (128)-(131). the point is that, like in the case
of the standard conformal mechanics [1], we have constraints among the constants of

10by time-dependent version we mean that they are related to the time independent ones in the

same manner as the n t-functions were via eqs. (95)(98).

motion. we have already one constraint and it is given by eq.(111). the others can
be obtained in the following manner: let us apply the operator caa on both sides of
eq.(111) and what we get is the following relation:

nhk0 + nkh  2ndd0 = 0

(132)

which is a constraint for the n-functions. let us now do the same applying on both
side of eq.(111) the operator caabb. what we get is:

n hk0 + n kh  2n dd0 = 0

(133)

which is a constraint among the n-functions. finally let us apply the qbrs on equation
(133) and we will get:

ifhk0 + iekh  21edd0  n hnk  n knh + 2n dnd = 0

(134)

which is a constraints among the fh, ed, ek.

so we have 4 constraints (134)(133)(132)(111) which bring down the constants of

motion to be specied in (a, ca, a, ca) from 12 to 8 as we expected.

7 conclusion

in this paper we have provided a new supersymmetric extension of conformal mechan-
ics. we have realized that the model is deeply geometrical in the sense that the grass-
mannian variables and the supersymmetric hamiltonian and various other charges are
all well-known objects in dierential geometry. in this case it is the dierential geom-
etry of the manifold and of the ows associated to the original conformal mechanical
model. we feel it was important to unveil the geometry because the recently discovered
connection between conformal mechanics and black-holes or in general the ads/cft
connection must have deeply geometrical origin.

what remains to be done, from a purely formal point of view, is to extend to our
model the recent analysis carried out in ref. [14] where it was found that the original
conformal mechanics model has a virasoro and w algebra. we hope to come back to
these issues using the tools developed in ref. [15].

last but not least, in performing this analysis we have discovered also a new universal
symmetry present also for non-conformal model and which, in our opinion is at the
heart of the interplay classical-quantum mechanics.

appendix

a details of the derivation of eqs.(84)-(87)

in this appendix we are going to show the detailed calculations leading to eqs.(84)-(87).
the reader may have notice the similarity between the charge qh (40) and the qd,qk
of eqs.(47) (48). we say similarity because all of them are made of two pieces, the
rst is the qbrs for all of them. it is easy to show that also the second pieces can be
put in a similar form. like for qh the second piece was (see table 3) of the form
nh = caah, so it is easy to show that both qd, and qk can be put in the form:

qd = qbrs  2 nd;

qk = qbrs   nk

where nd and nk are respectively:

nd = caad0;

nk = caak0

(a.1)

(a.2)

with the d0 and k0 given11 by eqs. (17)(18). so all three (nh, nd, nk) operators
could be put in the general form:

nx = caax

(a.3)

where x is either h, d0 or k0. in the case of d0 and k0 the x is quadratic in the
variables a:

x =

1
2

xabab

(a.4)

where xab is a constant 2  2 matrix.
in order to nd the cnx (that is the superspace version of nx) we should use

eqs. (79),(80) where  is now our operator nx. from the expression of nx we get for
a(t, , ) of eq.(80):

a(t, , ) = ab(bx) + iab(icddbx)

(a.5)

where  is the anticommuting parameter associated to the transformation. given the
form of x (see eq.(a.4) above), we get for (a.5):

11actually we should take the classical version of (17)(18) as we are doing classical mechanics.

a(t, , ) = abxbd[d + cd].

(a.6)

30

note that, using superelds, the above expression can be written as:

so we obtain from eq.(79) that the superspace expression of nx is

a(t, , ) = abxbd

d(t, , ).

(a.7)

(a.8)

(a.11)

the same kind of analysis we did here for the qd and qk can be done also for the qd
and qk. they can be written as:

d = abxbd .

(cnx)a

qd = qbrs + 2 n d;

qk = qbrs +  n k;

(a.9)

with

n d = caabbd;

n k = caabbk;

(a.10)

and the superspace representation of the n x turns out to be:

b = acxcb .

(cn x)a

remembering the form of the d0 and k0 functions in their classical version (see
eq.(17)(18)) and comparing it with the general form of x of eq.(a.4) above, we get
from eqs. (a.2)(a.3) that the matrices xab associated to d and k are12 exactly those
of eq.(88). so this is what we wanted to prove.

12we will call this form of xab as dab, and the one associated to k0 as kab, to stick to the

conventions of eqs.(84)-(87).

b representation of h, d, k in superspace

in this appendix we will reproduce the calculations which provide the superspace repre-
sentations of (h, d, k) contained in table 11. we will start rst with the operators
at time t = 0 which are listed in eqs. (16)-(18). using eqs.(79)(80) let us rst do the
variations (h,d,k)a. as (h, d0, k0) contain only (a) their action will aect only the
a eld contained in the supereld :

hq = [h, q] = i
hp = [h, p] = ip

g
q3

i
d0q = [d0, q] = 
2
i
d0p = [d0, p] = 
2
k0q = [k0, q] = iq
k0p = [k0, p] = 0.

p

q

considering that the two superelds are:

q = q +  cq + cp + ip;
p = p +  cp  cq  iq;

(b.1)

(b.2)

(b.3)

(b.4)

(b.5)

(b.6)

(b.7)

(b.8)

it is very easy to see that the b operators on the rhs of eqs.(79) can only be the

following:

;

h = 


t
1
3;
d0 = 
2
k0 = .

(b.9)

(b.10)

(b.11)

next we should pass to the representation of the time-dependent operators which are
related to the time-independent ones by eqs.(89)-(91). also for the superspace rep-
resentation there will be the same relations between the two set of operators, that
means:

h = h0;
d = t h + d0;
k = t2 h + 2t d0 + k0.

32

(b.12)

(b.13)

(b.14)

using the above relations and the expressions obtained in eqs.(b.8)-(b.10), it is easy
to reproduce the last three operators contained in table 11.
