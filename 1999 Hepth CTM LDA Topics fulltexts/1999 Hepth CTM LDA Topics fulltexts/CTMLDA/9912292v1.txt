we construct the worldline supereld massive superparticle actions
which preserve 1/4 portion of the underlying higher-dimensional su-
persymmetry. we consider the cases of n = 4  n = 1 and
n = 8  n = 2 partial breaking. in the rst case we present the
corresponding green-schwarz type target superspace action with one
-supersymmetry. in the second case we nd out two possibilities, one
of which is a direct generalization of the n = 4  n = 1 case, while
another is essentially dierent.

1. introduction. the most attractive feature of the description
of superbranes based on idea of the partial spontaneous breaking
of global supersymmetry (pbgs) [1] - [14] is the manifest o-shell
realization of the worldvolume supersymmetry. in this approach,
the physical worldvolume multiplets are interpreted as goldstone
superelds realizing spontaneous breaking of the full brane super-
symmetry group down to its unbroken worldvolume subgroup. the
invariant goldstone superelds actions, after passing to the com-
ponent elds, coincide with the static gauge forms of the relevant
green-schwarz (gs) type actions.

until present, only the examples of 1/2 breaking of supersym-
metry corresponding to the standard bps p-branes and d-branes
were treated in the literature on the pbgs. it is interesting to ex-
tend the pbgs framework to the 1/4 breaking and other fractional

1

patterns (see, e.g., [15]-[20] for the discussion of such options at the
algebraic level).

in the present talk we describe several examples of the 1/4
pbgs supereld actions in the simplest case of massive superpar-
ticles, namely, the actions corresponding to the pbgs patterns
n = 4  n = 1 and n = 8  n = 2. in the rst case we
construct a worldline supereld action and show its equivalence to
the gs-type target superspace action with one fermionic  symme-
try. in the second case we nd out two dierent models. for one
of them we nd the bosonic part of the worldline supereld action
and the corresponding gs-type action with two  symmetries. a
common feature of all the cases considered is that the algebras of
their underlying spontaneously broken d = 1 supersymmetries are
dimensionally-reduced forms of n = 1 and n = 2 d = 4 poincare
superalgebras extended by tensorial central charges [21, 22, 19, 20].

2. n=4  n=1 pbgs. our goal here will be to construct
a n = 1, d = 1 supereld action which respects three extra spon-
taneously broken supersymmetries. thus, the minimal multiplet
should include at least three n = 1 fermionic goldstone super-
elds i(t, )(i = 1, 2, 3) given on n = 1, d = 1 superspace with the
coordinates {t, } , (t = t,  = ). they should inhomogeneously
transform under the broken supersymmetries. one can check that
this requirement is met in a minimal way and the algebra of trans-
formations gets closed at cost of adding one additional fermionic
n = 1 supereld (t, ). the broken supersymmetry transforma-
tions read

i = i (1  d)  ijkjdk ,  = idi

,

where

d =




+ t , {d,d} = 2t .

i =

2dvi , (cid:16) i = i , vi = vi(cid:17) ,

vi = 2i (  ) + ijkjdvk ,  =

itvi .

due to the explicit presence of  in the transformations (5), the an-
ticommutators of q and the spontaneously broken supersymmetry
generators si acquire active central charges z i in the right-hand
side:

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

they form the following algebra1

{q, q} = 2p , nsi, sjo = 2ijp , nq, sio = 0 .

we wish to have a superparticle model with the worldline scalar
n = 1 multiplets containing physical bosonic elds. thus we are
led to introduce bosonic superelds vi

nq, sio = 2z i .

the central charge generators act as pure shifts of vi, suggesting the
interpretation of vi as goldstone superelds parametrizing trans-
verse directions in a four-dimensional space where z i, p act as the
translation operators.

surprisingly, the superalgebra (6) cannot be interpreted as a
dimensional reduction of the standard n = 1 poincare superalgebra
in d = 4, with z i, p being the components of full 4- momentum.
one should proceed not from the standard n = 1, d = 4 super
poincare algebra, but from its extension by tensorial central charges
[21, 22, 19, 20]. the generators z i turn out to partly come from
these central charges and partly from the extra components of 4-
momentum. namely,

p =

1
2

p0 , z 1 = p2 , z 2 = p1 , z 3 =

i
4

(t 22  t22) ,

(7)

1hereafter, we deal with the algebras of the supereld variations. the su-
peralgebras of the supercharges constructed by the pbgs actions following the
nother procedure are dierent: they inevitably include some constant central
charges which are crucial for evading [1, 2] the famous wittens no-go theorem
[23].

3

where the original n = 1, d = 4 superalgebra is dened by the
relations

{q, q } = 2 (m) pm ,
{q, q} = 2 t() ,

{ q , q } = 2 t (  ) .

(8)

let us construct invariant action for the system under consid-
eration. the eld (v) is a good candidate for the lagrangian
density

sv = z dtd(v) ,

(9)

in view of its transformation property (1). then the question is
how to covariantly express  in terms of i and, further, vi. this
can be done rather easily.

the most general ansatz for  is as follows

 = idia + 2ii

tb + 2idij

+ii

tjdje + 3di

tdjc
tdif + 32i

t dig ,

(10)

where a, b, . . . , g are as yet undetermined functions of x, and we
use the following notations

t = ti , 2i = ijkjk , 3 = ijkijk .
i

(11)

now, using (1), (10) we can write i in terms of i. then we ex-
plicitly evaluate  and require it to be equal to idi in accordance
with the transformation law (1). after rather lengthy calculations
we get the system of algebraic equations for the unknowns a, . . . , g

(12)

the integral (9) with  dened by (10), (12) provides us with the
action for the system under consideration.

we can greatly simplify this action. first, the b and c terms
in (10) can be absorbed into the f term. all the remaining e,
f , g terms can be reduced to the single a term, redening the
superelds vi as follows

tdkh1 + 3i

vi  i = vi + 3ijkj
th2 + ijk2jdkh3 , (13)
where h1, h2, h3 are some functions of x. these functions can
be given explicitly, but to know their precise structure is of no need
for our purposes. the action in terms of the redened bosonic
supereld i takes the very simple form

s = z dtd

2idi

1 + 1  4djdj

,

i

2di .

(14)

by construction, it is guaranteed to be invariant.

thus we have found the correct goldstone superelds action

describing the pbgs pattern n = 4  n = 1.
action (14)

let us end this section by noting that the bosonic core of the

sbos

 =

1

2 z dt(cid:18)1 q1  titi(cid:19)

(15)

is the standard massive d = 4 particle action in the static gauge.

3. target space action with one -supersymmetry.
to
clarify the situation with n = 4  n = 1 pbgs, we construct the
target space action which possesses only one  supersymmetry and
reduces to the action (14) in a xed gauge.

we shall deal with the n = 4 superalgebra (6).

in accord
with the standard strategy of constructing gs-type actions for
massive superparticles (see [26, 3, 4, 27, 6]) we introduce bosonic
x 0(t), y i(t) and fermionic (t), i(t) d = 1 elds, the coordinates
of a target n = 4 superspace, with the standard transformation
properties under n = 4 supersymmetry (6)

x 0 =   ii, y i = i  i,  = , i = i ,

(16)

5

and construct the invariants 0, i
0 = tx 0 + t + iti , i = ty i  ti + ti . (17)
after some guess-work, the target sigma-model action invariant

under the global target space supersymmetry (16), local t reparametriza-
tions and one local fermionic  symmetry was found to have the
following form

sgs = z dt00  ii z dt(cid:16)t  iti(cid:17) .

(18)

the  symmetry transformations are given by

i

 =  , i = 
x 0 =   ii, y i = i  i ,

0  00  ii

(19)

where (t) is an arbitrary fermionic gauge parameter.

the action (18) possesses only one  supersymmetry and there-
fore provides a space-time realization of the n = 4  n = 1
pbgs phenomenon.
to prove that there are no any other local fermionic symmetry
in (18) apart from -symmetry (19), we need to study the algebra
of the constraints in the hamiltonian formalism. we rst introduce
the einbein e(t) and rewrite the action (18) as

sgs = z dtl = z dt(cid:20) 1
z dt(cid:16)t  iti(cid:17) .

2e (cid:16)00  ii(cid:17) +

e

2(cid:21)

(20)

then we compute canonically conjugated variables

p 0 = 
i =   0

e  1! i 

0
e

, p i =

i
e

, pe = 0 ,  =  0

e

i ,

i
e

 .

6

(21)

the canonical hamiltonian reads

h = 

e
2

(p 0p 0  p ip i  1) .

(22)

there is one primary bosonic constraint, pe, and four fermionic
constraints

 0 =  + (p 0  1) + p ii ,
when taking the poisson bracket of the primary bosonic constraint
with the canonical hamiltonian, we obtain the secondary bosonic
constraint

 i = i + (p 0 + 1)i + p i . (23)

p 0p 0  p ip i = 1 .

(24)

we now have to determine which of the fermionic constraints   =
( 0,  i) are rst class, and thus generate gauge symmetries, and
which are second class. we compute the matrix of the poisson
brackets of the fermionic constraints

{ ,  } = c  , c = 2  p 0  1
~p

~p t

(p 0 + 1)1 ! ,

(25)

where 1 is the 3  3 unit matrix. the eigenvalues of c are easily
computed to be p 0 + 1, p 0 + 1, p 0 +q ~p 2 + 1, p 0 q ~p 2 + 1. on

the constraint surface, the last of these eigenvalues vanishes, and
the other three remain non zero. thus, there is only one rst class
constraint which may be chosen to be

 =  0 

1

p 0 + 1

~p ~ .

(26)

its poisson brackets with the constraints read

{,  0} =

2(p 0p 0  p ip i  1)

p 0 + 1

,

{,  i} = 0 .

(27)

this constraint generates the unique local fermionic symmetry (19)
through the poisson bracket.

7

in the static gauge the action (18) reads

sgs = z dt(cid:20)q(1 + iti)2  ty ity i  iti(cid:21) .

(28)

it is straightforward to show that it is related to the component
form of the action (14) by a eld redenition.

4. n=8  n=2 pbgs. to construct a superparticle model
which would exhibit n = 8  n = 2 pbgs we should, before all,
examine how 6 broken supersymmetries could be realized on a set
of n = 2, d = 1 superelds. we succeeded in nding two such
realizations.

case i. in the rst realization the basic set of n = 2, d = 1 super-
elds consists of seven bosonic superelds: a general real supereld
 and two conjugated triplets of chiral-anti-chiral superelds vi, vi:

dvi = dvi = 0 ,

i = 1, 2, 3 ,

where

d =




+

1
2

t, d =


 

+

1
2

t,

(29)

the broken supersymmetry transformations read

vi = 2(cid:16)  d(cid:17) i+ijkjdvk ,  =
together with the manifest supersymmetry, they form the algebra
with six central charges z i, z i

2 (cid:16)idvi + i dvi(cid:17) . (30)

1

nq, qo = p, nsi, sjo = ijp ,
nq, sio = 2z i , n q, sio = 2 z i .

the fermionic chiral superelds dened by

(31)

i = 

1
2

dvi , i =

1
2

dvi

8

are transformed under (30) as

i = (cid:16)1  dd(cid:17) i + ijkj d k,  = i i  ii.

so they are goldstone superelds corresponding to the linear real-
ization of six spontaneously broken supersymmetries with the pa-
rameters i, i. the bosonic superelds vi, vi are the goldstone ones
associated with the spontaneously broken central charges transfor-
mations.

(32)

once again, the supereld , in accord with its transformation
properties, can be chosen as the lagrangian density for this pbgs
pattern.

[24, 25].

to express  in terms of the goldstone superelds i, i, one
can apply the method of ref.
it basically consists in
passing to another supereld basis by performing a nite sponta-
neously broken supersymmetry transformation with the goldstone
fermionic superelds as the parameters. the redened supereld
 =  + o(, ) transforms homogeneously and so it can be put
equal to zero with preserving covariance under all supersymme-
tries. this produces equations allowing one to express  in terms
of i, i.

the straightforward application of this method to the present
case yields a rather complicated system of equations.
it can be
easily solved in the limit of vanishing fermions, yielding the static
gauge action for a massive particle in a 7-dimensional space-time
as the bosonic part of the full supereld action

sbos

v =

1

2 z dt(cid:18)1 q1 + tvitvi(cid:19) .

(33)

the gs formulation for this case is very similar to the case
of n = 4  n = 1 pbgs. we dene the standard realization
of n = 8 superalgebra (31) in the superspace with seven bosonic
x 0, y i, y i and eight fermionic , , i, i coordinates:

 =  , i = i , y i = 2i ,
2 (cid:16)  +  + i i + ii(cid:17) .
x 0 =

dening the invariants

0 = tx 0 +

1

2 (cid:16)t  + t + it i + iti(cid:17) ,

i = ty i + 2it ,

i  (i) .

we can construct the unique action

sgs = z dtq00  i i +z dt(cid:16) t  it i(cid:17) ,

with two  supersymmetries:

(35)

(36)

2 (cid:16)  +   + ii + i i(cid:17) ,

1

x 0 = 
y i = 2i ,
i =

i 

0 + 00  i i

.

(37)

the hamiltonian analysis, which repeats the basic steps of the anal-
ysis in the n = 4  n = 1 case, shows that there are no further
gauge fermionic symmetries in the action (36).
in the static gauge, x 0 = t,  = 0, the action (36) takes the

very simple form

sgs = z dt


s(cid:18)1 +
+ it ii .

1
2

it i +

1
2

ti i(cid:19)2

+ ty it y i

(38)

case ii. the second realization of n = 8, d = 1 supersymmetry
with six spontaneously broken supersymmetries can be constructed
in terms of general bosonic n = 2 supereld  and six chiral and

anti-chiral goldstone fermions n, , , o ,  = 1, 2
d  = d  = 0 ,

d = d = 0 ,

(39)

10

which form two doublets and two singlets with respect to so(2)
automorphism group. the appropriate closed set of the broken
supersymmetry transformations reads

 = (cid:16)1 + dd(cid:17)  +   d  ,

 =       + 

(40)

 = (cid:16) d  +  d (cid:17) +(cid:16)1  dd(cid:17)  .

to reveal the underlying central-charges extended supersymme-
try algebra and to gain physical bosonic elds, we need to pass as
before to bosonic superelds. the minimal realization amounts to
introducing two real scalar superelds u:

 = 

1
2

du ,

 =

1
2

du .

(41)

to learn what kind of prepotential one should introduce for the
remaining goldstone supereld , let us examine the relation be-
tween u(1) charges of spinor superelds which follows from (40)

q = 2q  qd .

(42)

here qd is the u(1) charge of the covariant derivative d (qd = 1
if one ascribes the charge +1 to ). from this relation and eq. (41)
it follows that the only way to introduce the bosonic supereld v
for  is to choose it complex and having the u(1) charge 2qd

 = 

1
2

dv ,

 =

1
2

dv , dv = dv = 0 .

(43)

in terms of v, v the supersymmetry transformations become:

v = 2(cid:16) + d(cid:17)  +  du ,
u = (cid:16)du +  du + dv +  dv(cid:17)
+2(cid:16) + d(cid:17)   2(cid:16)  d(cid:17)  ,
2 (cid:16)dv +  dv   du  du(cid:17) .

 = 

1

(44)

11

denoting the generators of the broken supersymmetry by s, s
and s, s, and the generators of the manifest n = 2 supersymmetry
by q, q, one can write the full supersymmetry algebra pertinent to
this case as

nq, qo = ns, so = p, ns, so = ,p,
nq, so = 2 z, n q, so = 2z, nq, so = 2z,
n q, so = 2z, ns, so = 2z, n s, so = 2z .(45)

once again, we can take the supereld  as the lagrangian den-
sity. to covariantly express  in terms of the goldstone fermions
or goldstone bosons, we may again stick to the general method of
[24, 25]. however it gives rather complicated equations which we
for the time being were unable to solve. we could try to nd at
least the bosonic part of the action. we get the following quartic
equation for the bosonic part of the action which we denote by x:

(x 2  x + a)(x 2 + a  1) + 2d d  = 0 ,

(46)

where

a = d d  + dd  .

the general solution of this equation exists (we require it to vanish
in the limit when all elds are put equal to zero), but it looks not
too illuminating to present it here. in the two limits,  = 0 or
 = 0, it takes the familiar form of the static gauge actions of
massive particles moving on some 3-dimensional target manifolds

sbos

v

u =

2 z dt(cid:18)1 q1 + tvtv(cid:19) ,
2 z dt(cid:18)1 q1 + tutu(cid:19) .

(47)

in the generic case there is a non-trivial cross-interaction between
the bosonic elds appearing in (47). it can hopefully be interpreted

12

in terms of intersection of the trajectories of two dierent super-
particles, with the physical worldline scalar multiplets represented
by the superelds u and v, v, respectively.

the fact that the bosonic part of the action cannot be written in
the standard static gauge nambu-goto form seriously obscures the
construction of the gs formulation for this case. we believe that
the better understanding of this case would be helpful for studying
the 1/4 pbgs systems with higher-dimensional worldvolumes.

5. conclusions.
in this paper we presented, for the rst time,
the manifestly worldline supersymmetric superparticle actions ex-
hibiting hidden spontaneously broken supersymmetries the number
of which is four times the number of the linearly realized manifest
ones. we treated in detail the case of n = 4  n = 1 partial
breaking and discussed some basic features of the more compli-
cated n = 8  n = 2 case. the common unusual feature of
the superparticle systems considered is that their space-time inter-
pretation is possible only within the superspaces corresponding to
higher-dimensional supersymmetries with tensorial central charge
generators. it would be of interest to understand whether this is
the general property of systems with fractional pbgs.
