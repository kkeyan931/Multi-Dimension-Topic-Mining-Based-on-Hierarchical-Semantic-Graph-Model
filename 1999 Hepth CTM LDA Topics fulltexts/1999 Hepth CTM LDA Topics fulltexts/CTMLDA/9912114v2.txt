abstract

one-loop calculations in quantum gravity coupled to u (1)-abelian elds
(photon elds) are ultraviolet nite and cuto-free in the framework of
causal perturbation theory. we compute the photon loop graviton self-
energy and the photon self-energy in second order perturbation theory. the
condition of perturbative gauge invariance to second order is shown and
generates the gravitational slavnovward identities. quantum corrections
to the newtonian potential through the photon loop graviton self-energy
are also derived.

introduction

the standard eld theoretical perturbative approach to quantum gravity (see
the introduction to this subject in [1] and references therein), considered as a at
space-time relativistic quantum eld theory of gravitons, massless rank-2 tensor
elds, coupled to photons, massless vector elds, leads to non-renormalizable
ultraviolet (uv) divergences. these were found by means of dimensional regu-
larization and background eld method [2], [3], [4] and [5].

a closer investigation of loop calculations in quantum eld theory shows that
the reason for the uv divergences lies basically in the fact that one performs
mathematically ill-dened operations, when using feynman rules for closed loop
graphs, because one multiplies feynman propagators as if they were ordinary
functions.

we show how it is possible to overcome these discouraging outcomes by
applying an improved perturbation scheme which has as central objects the
time-ordered products and as constructing principle causality. the s-matrix is
constructed inductively as a sum of smeared operator-valued n-point distribu-
tions avoiding uv divergences.

uv niteness of s-matrix elements is then a consequence of a deeper math-
ematical understanding of how loop graph contributions have to be calculated.
this idea goes back to stuckelberg, bogoliubov and shirkov and the pro-
gram (causal perturbation theory) was carried out successfully by epstein and
glaser [6] for scalar eld theories and subsequently applied to qed by scharf [7],
to non-abelian gauge theories by dutsch et al. [8] and to quantum gravity [9].
in this work we carry out the analysis of the coupled quantized einstein
maxwell system, sec. 2.2. two main topics will be investigated in this paper:
the gauge structure of the theory and the uv niteness of loop graphs in second
order perturbation theory.

the rst is formulated by means of a gauge charge that generates innites-
imal gauge variations of the fundamental free quantum elds. gauge invariance
of the s-matrix implies then a set of identities between the c-number part of
the 2-point distributions, sec. 2.4, which implies the gravitational slavnovward
identities (swi) [10].

the second is obtained by applying the causal perturbation scheme, sec. 3,
to the calculations of the photon loop graviton self-energy, sec. 4, and of the
photon self-energy, sec. 5, in second order perturbation theory. in both cases the
results are uv nite and cuto-free and the inherent ambiguity in the normaliza-
tion of the 2-point distribution is settled by requiring appropriate normalization
conditions for mass and coupling constant.

in addition, the causal scheme preserves the gauge symmetries of the theory.
the trace of the graviton self-energy tensor vanishes. this property was mani-
festly broken using dimensional regularization in order to extract nite results
from uv divergent quantities [11].

from the photon loop graviton self-energy we sketch the derivation of quan-

3

tum corrections to the newtonian potential between two spinless massive bodies
in the static non-relativistic limit, sec. 4.5.

gauge structure and one-loop calculations with gravitational self-coupling
are not considered here, see [9], [12], [13], and [14]. these references contain
also the notations and the conventions used here.

we use the unit convention:  = c = 1, greek indices , , . . . run from 0 to

3, whereas latin indices i, j, . . . run from 1 to 3.

2 quantized einsteinmaxwell system and pertur-

bative gauge invariance

2.1 inductive s-matrix construction

in causal perturbation theory [7], [15], one makes an ansatz for the s-matrix
as a formal power series in the coupling constant, namely as a sum of smeared
operator-valued distributions:

s(g) = 1 +



xn=1

1

n!z d4x1 . . . d4xn tn(x1, . . . , xn) g(x1)  . . .  g(xn) ,

(2.1)

where the schwartz test function g  s(r4) switches adiabatically the interac-
tion and provides a natural infrared cuto in the long range part of the interac-
tion. the s-matrix maps the asymptotically incoming free elds on the outgoing
ones and it is possible to express the tns by means of free elds. interacting
quantum elds are never used in the causal scheme.

the n-point distribution tn is a well-dened renormalized time-ordered

product expressed in terms of wick monomials of free elds :o(x1, . . . , xn):

tn(x1, . . . , xn) =xo

:o(x1, . . . , xn) : to

n (x1  xn, . . . , xn1  xn) .

(2.2)

the tns are c-number distributions. tn is constructed inductively from the
rst order t1(x), which plays the role of the interaction lagrangian in terms of
free elds, and from the lower orders tj, j = 2, . . . , n  1 by means of poincare
covariance and causality. the latter leads directly to uv nite and cuto-free
tn-distributions.

2.2 quantized einsteinmaxwell system

in the context of linearized gravity (without graviton self-interactions [9], [13],
[14]) coupled to photon eld [3], the interaction between the quantized symmet-
ric tensor eld h(x), the graviton, and the quantized vector eld a(x), the
photon, is considered in the background of minkowski space-time.

the free graviton eld satises the wave equation

 h (x) = 0 ,

(2.3)

4

and is quantized according to

where the b-tensor is constructed from the minkowski metric

(cid:2)h (x), h (y)(cid:3) = i b d0(x  y) ,
2(cid:16) +    (cid:17) ,

1

b :=

and d0(x) is the mass-zero causal jordanpauli distribution:

d0(x) = d(+)

2

(x2) sgn(x0)

0 (x) + d()
i

0 (x) =

=

(2)3 z d4p (p2) sgn(p0) ei px .

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

(see [12] and [13] for the details of this procedure). the additional degrees
of freedom present in the symmetric tensor eld h (gravitons are massless
spin-2 particles) could be eliminated by imposing appropriate gauge and trace
conditions, but these are disregarded in the following and only considered later
as a characterization of the physical states [12].

from the point of view of lagrangian eld theory [3], the hilberteinstein

lagrangian lhe = 2 2 g g r , (2 = 32g), is written by means of
the goldberg variable g := g g and expanded as g =  +  h
around the at space-time  = diag(+1,1,1,1). from the zeroth order,
choosing the gauge h

, = 0, one obtains (2.3).

the free photon eld fulls also the wave equation

 a(x) = 0 ,

and is quantized as

(cid:2)a(x), a (y)(cid:3) = +i  d0(x  y) .

also the eld strength f  := a   a will be used in the following.
2.3 gauge invariance and first order coupling t a

1 (x)

(2.7)

(2.8)

the u (1)em gauge content [7] of the photon eld is formulated by means of the
gauge charge qa

qa := zx0=const

d3x a (x),


0
x v(x) ,

(2.9)

where v(x) is a c-number scalar eld satisfying v(x) = 0. actually, due to the
generality of the gravitational coupling, one should also consider the coupling
between h and the quantized electromagnetic ghost v and anti-ghost v scalar

elds, but this would have the form   h vv from g vv and therefore

5

can be written as a total divergence in the sense of vector analysis because of
the presence of two equal derivatives on three massless elds. for this reason
the electromagnetic ghosts will not be considered here.

on the other side, the gauge content of the graviton eld (which is related
to the general covariance of g (x) under coordinate transformations [16]) is
formulated by the gauge charge [9], [14]

q := zx0=const

d3x h (x),


0
x u(x) .

(2.10)

in order for gauge invariance to rst order in pure quantum gravity to hold
(see eq. (2.15)) [9], for the construction of the physical subspace [12] and in
order to prove unitarity of the s-matrix on the physical subspace [12], we need
to quantize the ghost eld u(x), together with the anti-ghost eld u(x), as
fermionic vector elds

u(x) = 0 , u(x) = 0 ,

whereas all other anti-commutators vanish. the gauge charges generate the
following innitesimal gauge variations of the fundamental quantum elds:

(cid:8)u(x), u (y)(cid:9) = i  d0(x  y) ,

(2.11)

dqh (x) :=(cid:2)q, h (x)(cid:3) = i bu(x), ,

dq u(x) :=(cid:8)q, u(x)(cid:9) = i h(x), ,

dqaf (x) = 0 .

x v(x) ,

(2.12)

dqu(x) :=(cid:8)q, u(x)(cid:9) = 0 ,
dqaa(x) :=(cid:2)qa, a(x)(cid:3) = i 

the operator dq obeys also the leibniz rule

dq(a b) = (dqa) b + (1)ng(a)a dqb ,

(2.13)

for arbitrary operators a and b, where ng(a) is the number of ghost elds
minus the number of anti-ghost elds in the wick monomial a.

for convenience of notation, the trace of the graviton eld is written as h =
h
 and all lorentz indices of the elds are written as superscripts whereas the
derivatives acting on the elds are written as subscripts. all indices occurring
twice are contracted by the minkowski metric  . we skip the space-time
dependence if the meaning is clear.

the rst order interaction between graviton eld and photon elds is dictated
by gauge invariance and by the assumption that the graviton interacts with the
traceless and conserved electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor, see below.

gauge invariance of the s-matrix means formally

lim
g1

dqs(g) = 0 ,

and

lim
g1

dqas(g) = 0 .

(2.14)

since the existence of the adiabatic limit g  1 in massless theories can be
problematic, we consider the condition of perturbative gauge invariance to n-th
order

dqtn(x1, . . . , xn) = dqatn(x1, . . . , xn) = sum of divergences ,

(2.15)

6

which implies s-matrix gauge invariance, because divergences do not contribute
in the adiabatic limit g  1 due to partial integration and gauss theorem.

we dene t a

1 (x) as

t a
1 (x) := i


2

: h (x) b t 

em (x) : ,

(2.16)

where t 
reads

em (x) corresponds to the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor and

t 
em (x) := f (x) f 

(x) +

1
4

 f (x) f(x) .

(2.17)

actually, the b-tensor is not essential, because t 
the goldberg variable expansion. t a
the expansion of the generally covariant electromagnetic lagrangian density

em is traceless. its origin lies in
1 (x) corresponds to the term of order  in

la =

g f f g g ,

(2.18)

as a function of g around the at space-time.

perturbative gauge invariance to rst order is readily established. t a

1 (x) is

u (1)em gauge invariant

dqat a

1 (x) = 0 ,

(2.19)

due to dqaf  (x) = 0. the u (1)em gauge structure of the theory is rather
trivial and will not be considered.

holds because of t 
it
allows us to formulate the condition of perturbative gauge invariance to the
n-th order in a precise way :

(2.21)

n

xl=1

where t 
n/l is the renormalized time-ordered product, obtained according to the
inductive causal scheme, with one q-vertex at xl, while all other n  1 vertices
are ordinary t1-vertices.

2.4 consequences of perturbative gauge invariance to second

order

without performing any calculation, from the structure of t a
that the two-point distribution describing loop graphs has the form

1 we can anticipate

t2(x, y)loops =: h(x)h (y) : thh(x, y) + : f (x)f  (y) : tf f (x, y) .

7

here, the rst term represents the photon loop graviton self-energy and the
second term the photon self-energy. the c-number distributions thh and tf f
will be explicitly calculated in sec. 4 and in sec. 5, respectively.

perturbative gauge invariance to second order, eq. (2.21) with n = 2, enables
us to derive a set of identities for these distributions by comparing the distri-
butions attached to the same external operators on both sides of eq. (2.21), as
in [17]. calculating dqt2(x, y)loops we obtain

dqt2(x, y)loops =+ : u(x),h (y) : (cid:0)  i b thh(x, y)(cid:1) +
+ : h(x)u(y), : (cid:0)  i b thh(x, y)(cid:1) .

on the other side, the loop contributions coming from t 
the form

2/1(x, y) can only be of

(2.22)

t 
2/1(x, y) =: u(x)h (y) : t

uh(x, y) + : u(x)h (y) : tuh(x, y) .

(2.23)

applying x

 to the expression above we nd

x
t 

2/1(x, y) =+ : u(x),h (y) : (cid:8)t
(cid:8)t

+ : u(x)h (y) : x

uh(x, y) +  
uh(x, y) +  

 tuh(x, y)(cid:9) +
 tuh(x, y)(cid:9) .

we compare the c-number distributions in (2.22) and in (2.24) attached to the
external operators

(2.24)

: u(x),h (y) :

and

: u(x)h (y) : .

(2.25)

no such terms come from t 

2/2(x, y). therefore, we obtain the identities

i b thh(x, y) =(cid:8)t
(cid:8)t

0 = x

uh(x, y)

 +  tuh(x, y)(cid:9) ,
 +  tuh(x, y)(cid:9) .

uh(x, y)

by applying x

 to the rst identity and inserting the second one, we obtain

(2.26)

b x

 thh(x, y) = 0

(2.27)

this identity has been explicitly checked in eq. (4.20) and implies the grav-
itational slavnovward identities [3], [10] for the two-point connected green
function (see sec. 4.3)

3 causal construction of the two-point distribution

we outline briey the main steps in the inductive causal construction of t2(x, y)
from the rst order interaction t a
1 (x). following the inductive scheme [7], we
rst calculate

r
2(x, y) := t a

1 (y) t a

1 (x) , a

2(x, y) := t a

1 (x) t a

1 (y) .

(3.1)

8

from these two quantities, we form the causal distribution

d2(x, y) := r

2(x, y)  a

(3.2)

2(x, y) =(cid:2)t a

1 (x), t a

1 (y)(cid:3) .

in order to obtain d2(x, y), one has to carry out all possible contractions between
the normally ordered t1 using wicks lemma, so that d2(x, y) has the following
structure (see (2.2))

d2(x, y) =xo

:o(x, y) : do

2 (x  y) .

(3.3)

do
2 (x  y) is a numerical distributions that depends only on the relative coordi-
nate x  y, because of translation invariance.
d2(x, y) contains tree (one contraction), loop (two contractions) and vac-
uum graph (three contractions) contributions. due to the presence of normal
ordering, tadpole diagrams do not appear. d2(x, y) is causal, i.e. supp(do
2 (z)) 
v +(z)  v (z), with z := x  y.
in order to obtain t2(x, y) we have to split d2(x, y) into a retarded part,
r2(x, y), and an advanced part, a2(x, y), with respect to the coincident point
z = 0, so that supp(r2(z))  v +(z) and supp(a2(z))  v (z). this split-
ting, or time-ordering, has to be carried out in the distributional sense with
great care so that the retarded and advanced part are well-dened and uv
nite [6], [7].

the splitting aects only the numerical distribution do

2 (x  y) and must be
accomplished according to the correct singular order (do
2 ) which describes
roughly speaking the behaviour of do
2 (p) in
the limit p  , respectively. if  < 0, then the splitting is trivial and agrees
with the standard time-ordering. if   0, then the splitting is non-trivial and
non-unique:

2 (x  y) near x  y = 0, or that of do

do
2 (x  y)  ro

x|a|=0

(3.4)

and a retarded part ro

(3.5)

2 (p) =

which requires modications in the case of massless theories [8].

eq. (3.4) contains a local normalization ambiguity: the ca,os are undeter-
mined nite normalization constants, which multiply terms with point support
da(4)(x  y) (da is a partial dierential operator). this freedom in the nor-
malization has to be restricted by physical conditions. for example, lorentz
covariance and gauge invariance will be used in our discussions.

9

finally, t2(x, y) is obtained by subtracting r

2(x, y) from r2(x, y) and can

be written as

t2(x, y) + n2(x, y) =xo

:o(x, y) : (cid:26)to

2 (x  y) +

(do
2 )

x|a|=0

ca,o da (4)(x  y)(cid:27) ,

(3.6)

where n2(x, y) represents the normalization terms given by the second term on
the right side.

4 photon one-loop contribution to the graviton

self-energy

4.1 causal d2(x, y)-distribution for the photon loop

we now apply the causal scheme described in sec. 3 in order to calculate the
2-point distribution t2(x, y)gse that describes the photon loop graviton self-
energy.

first of all, from the commutation rules (2.4) and (2.8) we derive the con-

tractions between two eld operators

c(cid:8)h(x) h (y)(cid:9) :=(cid:2)h(x)(), h (y)(+)(cid:3) = i b d(+)
c(cid:8)a(x) a(y)(cid:9) :=(cid:2)a(x)(), a (y)(+)(cid:3) = +i  d(+)
0 (x  y) ,

0 (x  y) ,

where () refers to the positive/negative frequency part of the corresponding
quantity.
2(x, y)gse, dened in eq. (3.1), are ob-
tained by performing two photon contractions between the two rst order inter-
actions t a

1 (y). after this operation, we obtain

the distributions r

2(x, y)gse and a

1 (x) and t a

2(x, y)gse = + : h(x)h (y) : a

 ,
2(x  y)gse
 .
2(x y)gse

the c-number tensorial distributions a
 are given
by linear combinations of products between positive/negative frequency parts
of the jordanpauli distributions (2.6) and carry four derivatives (each photon
eld in t a
1 carries one derivative). therefore, the basic distribution appearing
here is

(4.5)

(see app. 1 of [13]), because products of jordanpauli distributions go over into
convolutions of the corresponding fourier transforms. therefore, we see that
we have to deal with integrals of the type

i ()(p)//// :=z d4k (cid:0)(p  k)2(cid:1) (cid:0)  (p0  k0)(cid:1) (k2) (k0)

(4.6)

these integrals have been calculated in detail in app. 2 of [13] and partially
in [8]. we give here only the nal results:

is typical for a loop with massless particles) and the numerical coecients always
refer to the polynomial structure as in eq. (4.10). the polynomial p (p)gse
 has
degree four in p, because of the four derivatives present on the two contracted
photon lines.

4.2 singular order, distribution splitting and graviton self-

energy tensor

according to the inductive construction of t2(x, y), sec. 3, the next step is
the splitting of d2(x, y) into a retarded part r2(x, y) and an advanced part
a2(x, y). in this procedure the singular order of the distribution d2(x, y) plays

12

an essential role. from (4.10) it follows that ( d2) = 4, because of the presence
of the polynomial of degree four in p.

a general formula for the singular order of any distribution in linearized
gravity coupled to photon elds can be found by considering in the n-th order
of perturbation theory an arbitrary n-point distribution

t g
n (x1, . . . , xn) =:

h(xkj )

nh

yj=1

na

yi=1

a(xmi) : tg

n (x1, . . . , xn) .

(4.12)

n corresponds to a graph g with nh external graviton lines and na ex-

this t g
ternal photon lines. then we state that the singular order of g is given by

(g)  4  nh  na  d + n .

(4.13)

here, d is the number of derivatives on the external eld operators in (4.12).
the explicit presence of the order of perturbation theory renders the theory
non-normalizable: the number of free undetermined, but nite normalization
terms in eq. (3.6) increases with the order of perturbation theory, that is the
theory has a weaker predictive power but it is still well-dened in the sense of
uv niteness. the proof of (4.13) has the same structure as in qed, yangmills
theories and pure quantum gravity, see therefore [7], [8] and [13], respectively.

in the case of the graviton self-energy contribution, eq. (4.9), we obtain
from (4.13) the correct result ( d2) = 4, being nh = 2, na = 0, d = 0 and
n = 2. the singular order of a distribution remains unchanged after distribution
splitting.

because of the decomposition (4.11),

it suces to split d(p), which has
( d) = 0, in order to obtain a retarded part r(p). the full retarded distribution
is then given by r2(p)gse
 r(p). the ambiguity in the normaliza-
tion appearing in the splitting formula (3.4) will be discussed in sec. 4.4.

 =  p (p)gse

the splitting of the scalar distribution d(p) was already carried out in [8],
using a modication of the formula (3.5) for the retarded part, see also [13]. we
quote only the result for the analytic continuation to p  r4 of the retarded
part:

r(p)an =

i
2

log(cid:18)p2  i p00

m 2

(cid:19) ,

where m > 0 is a scale invariance breaking mass. then

r2(x, y)gse =: h(x)h (y) : r2(x  y)gse
 log(cid:18)p2  i p00
r2(p)gse

 = i

p (p)gse


2

m 2

 ,

(cid:19) .

(4.14)

(4.15)

the distribution t2(x, y) is obtained from r2(x, y) by subtracting r
2(x, y),
eq. (4.2). this subtraction aects only the scalar distribution. since r(p) =

13

(p2) (p0), we obtain

t(p) = r(p)an  r(p) =

i
2

log(cid:18)p2  i 0
m 2 (cid:19) .

(4.16)

therefore, the 2-point distribution for the photon loop graviton self-energy reads

t2(x, y)gse =: h(x)h (y) : i (x  y)gse
i (p) = i (cid:2)  16,8, +12,12, +8(cid:3) log(cid:18)p2  i 0
m 2 (cid:19) ,

 ,

(4.17)

with  := 1
2 . the most important aspect of this result lies in the fact that
the obtained t2(x, y)gse-distribution is uv nite without the introduction of
counterterms [2], [3] and [4] and cuto-free. note that m is a normalization
constant and not a cuto.

4.3 slavnovward identities from perturbative gauge invari-

ance

we investigate the gauge properties of the graviton self-energy tensor. for
simplicity let us denote by [a, b, c, e, f ] the ve numerical coecients of (x
y) given as in eq. (4.10).
first of all, t2(x, y)gse satises the condition of perturbative gauge in-
variance to second order (2.21). using the innitesimal operator gauge vari-
ation (2.12), we obtain

dqt2(x, y)gse = + x

+ y

(cid:16) : u(x)h (y) : (cid:2) + b (x  y)(cid:3)(cid:17) +
(cid:16) : h(x)u(y) : (cid:2) + b (x  y)(cid:3)(cid:17) ,

(4.18)

because, after working out explicitly in momentum space, the necessary condi-
tion for (4.18) to hold,

b p (p) = 0 ,

(4.19)

corresponds to the identity (2.27) and is satised by (p) of eq. (4.17). in
terms of the a, . . . , f coecients, (4.19) implies

c + e = 0 , a  2b = 0 , b  2e  2f = 0 .

(4.20)

and these relations are satised by the polynomial in (4.17).

we show now that these relations implies the gravitational slavnovward
identities (swi) [3], [10]. we construct the 2-point connected green function
with one photon loop

g(p)[2]

 := b df

0 (p) (p) b df

0 (p) ,

(4.21)

14

with the feynman propagator df
swi reads

0 (p) = (2)2(p2  i0)1. the gravitational

p g(p)[2]

 = 0 ,

(4.22)

namely the 2-point connected green function is transversal. eq. (4.22) implies
the relations

c + e = 0 , a  2b = 0 ,

a
4

+ c  f = 0 .

(4.23)

analysis of (4.20) and (4.23) shows that the condition of perturbative gauge
invariance is equivalent to the gravitational swi. in addition, the photon loop is
transversal also without the b-tensors that come from the graviton propagators:

p (p) = 0 ,

(4.24)

because the equivalent relations

c + e = 0 , b + f = 0 , a + b + 2c = 0 .

(4.25)

are fullled by (4.17). this property follows directly from our perturbative
invariance condition (2.27), because the trace of (p) vanishes (see below).
the last two properties of (p) concern its trace and are related to
conformal transformations. conformal invariance is manifest in the vanishing of
the trace of the maxwell energy-momentum tensor in four dimension. basically,
the photon loop graviton self-energy consists of a time-ordered product of two
such traceless photon energy-momentum tensors (2.17). therefore, in addition
to the identities (4.19), it is expected that (p) and g(p)[2]
 are traceless.
the condition

 (p) = 0 ,

(4.26)

namely that the photon loop graviton self-energy tensor is traceless, implies the
relations

b + 2e + 4f = 0 , a + 4b + 4c = 0 .

(4.27)

these are satised by (4.17). note that (4.27) does not follow from the pertur-
bative gauge invariance conditions (4.20). in addition, in our approach, also the
trace of the 2-point connected green function vanishes:

 g(p)[2]

 = 0 ,

(4.28)

because the equivalent relations

a
2

+ 3b + 2c + 2e + 4f = 0 , a + 4b + 4c = 0 .

(4.29)

15

are satised by the coecients of the photon loop self-energy tensor in eq. (4.17).
this is in sharp contrast to the calculation in [3], [11], performed within the di-
mensional regularization scheme. this scheme generates conformal trace anoma-
lies [18], because the trace operation is not dimensional invariant. as a conse-
quence, the extraction of the nite part from uv divergent quantities breaks
this symmetry.

causal perturbation theory not only provides us with uv nite results but
preserves the underlying symmetries of the theory such as the swi and the
vanishing of the trace of the self-energy tensor.
invariance under conformal
transformations is broken by the presence of the mass scale m in the logarithm
of eq. (4.17). if necessary, we could exploit the ambiguity in the normalization
to restore it, see sec. 4.4.

4.4 freedom in the normalization of the graviton self-energy

we still have to discuss the ambiguity in the splitting procedure, namely the
appearance of undetermined local normalization terms.

having singular order four, the 2-point photon loop graviton self-energy

contribution t2(x, y)gse admits a general normalization of the form
n2(x, y)gse =: h(x)h (y) : i n (x, y) (4)(x  y) ,

n(p) = n (p)(0)

 + n (p)(2)

 + n (p)(4)

 ,

(4.30)

where the odd terms are excluded by parity. n (p)(i)
 is a polynomial in p of
degree i with i = 0, 2, 4. we assume in addition that only scalar constants should
be considered, because vector-valued or tensor-valued constants may endanger
lorentz covariance. taking the symmetries of (x  y) into account, we
make the following ansatz

n (p)(0)
n (p)(2)

 = (cid:2) + c1(cid:0) + (cid:1) + c2 (cid:3) ,
 = (cid:2) + c3(cid:0)pp + pp(cid:1) +

+ c4(cid:0)pp + pp + pp + pp(cid:1) +
+ c5 p2(cid:0) +  (cid:1) + c6 p2 (cid:3) ,

(4.31)

n (p)(4)

 = (cid:2)c7, c8, c9, c10, c11(cid:3) .

c1, . . . , c11 are undetermined real numbers. the normalization polynomials have
to full the same symmetries as  , namely: (4.20), (4.25), (4.27) and (4.29).
these reduce the choice to

n (p)(0)

 = 0 ,

n (p)(2)

 = 0 ,

n (p)(4)

 = 

c11

4 (cid:2)  16,8, +12,12, +8(cid:3) .

(4.32)

since n(p)(4)
 has the same structure as  , we absorb the undetermined
parameter c11 in the mass scale m appearing in eq. (4.17) through the rescaling

16

c11 = 4 log(m 2/m 2
0 ). the whole freedom in the normalization is reduced to the
mass parameter m0 in the logarithm owing to the symmetries that the self-
energy tensor and its normalization have to full.

this normalization automatically preserves graviton mass- and coupling
constant-normalizations. if one sums up the innite series with an increasing
number of photon loop graviton self-energy insertions, the vanishing of n (p)(0)

implies that the graviton mass is not shifted by quantum corrections and the
vanishing of n (p)(2)
 implies that the coupling constant  is not changed by
quantum corrections.

as pointed out at the end of sec. 4.3, we could exploit this normalization
to restore conformal invariance. through a rescaling of m0 we can compensate
the variation of p2 under such a transformation. the drawback lies in the
arbitrariness of this operation.

4.5 corrections to the newtonian potential

as pointed out in [19], [20], [21] and [22], massless particle loop corrections to the
graviton propagator leads to quantum corrections of the newtonian potential
between massive spinless bodies in the static non-relativistic limit. these can be
appropriately dened by considering the whole set of diagrams in the scattering
12  12, where i represents a scalar eld of mass mi, of the order 4 (i.e.
 g2). then one isolates the non-local contributions. these lead to r2 and
r3 corrections to the newtonian potential v (r) = gm1m2r1 in the static
non-relativistic limit. for this purpose, the logarithm-dependent result (4.17)
generates the correction

v (r) =  g

m1m2

r

(cid:18)1 +

g
c3

1

r2(cid:19) ,

(4.33)

as calculated in [13], where  and c are put back in the expression and the

relevant length scale appears to be the planck length lp =pg/c3.
note that the mass scale m in eq. (4.17) is irrelevant, because it contributes
only to local terms  (3)(x). therefore, the still remaining freedom in the nor-
malization, namely the choice of m , is irrelevant to physical quantum corrections
of the newtonian potential.

the correction in eq. (4.33) is only a partial one, because we have taken
into account only the photon loop graviton self-energy contribution and not the
complete set of diagrams of order 4 contributing to these corrections, as, for
example, the vertex correction or the double scattering. therefore we cannot
make any statement on the absolute sign and magnitude of the numerical factor
in eq. (4.33). to our knowledge, photon loop corrections to the exchanged
graviton have not been considered yet.

17

5 photon self-energy

we now turn to the calculation of the photon self-energy. since the main features
of the causal scheme have already been presented, we can go on more speedily.
moreover this graph is not interesting from the point of view of gauge invariance:
it is trivially gauge invariant due to dqaf  = 0.
2(x, y) and r

the expression in (5.2) has to be antisymmetrized in    and in

distributions. therefore, with (4.6) we nd in momentum space

a
2(p)| =

2

48(2)4 (cid:2) + 2pp  2pp  2pp + 2pp +

 p2 + p2(cid:3) (p2) (p0) .

(5.4)

2(x, y) is analogous to that of a

the result for r

space the factor (p0) is present instead of (p0). the causal d2-distribution

| ,

(5.5)

from eq. (4.13) or from direct inspection, we ascertain that the singular or-
der of the distribution is two. the distribution splitting is the same as in
sec. 4.2, eq. (4.16), because the loop consists of massless particles. therefore,
the t2(x, y)-distribution corresponding to the photon self-energy reads

2(p)pse

| =

t2(x, y)pse =: f (x)f (y) : (cid:0)  i (x  y)pse

48(2)5 (cid:2)the same as in (5.4)(cid:3) log(cid:18)p2  i0
m 2 (cid:19) .

(5.6)

18

u (1)em -perturbative gauge invariance to second order holds trivially:

dqat2(x, y)pse = 0 .

(5.7)

the photon self-energy 2-point distribution can be written also in terms of the
photon eld a:

t2(x, y)pse =: a(x),a(y), : (cid:0)  4 i (x  y)pse
|(cid:1)

=: a(x)a(y) : (cid:0)  i (x  y)(cid:1) ,

(5.8)

by disregarding non-contributing divergences (in the adiabatic limit g  1 of
eq. (2.1)). then t2(x, y)pse has the same structure as the photon self-energy
in qed [7] and the reduced photon self-energy tensor appearing eq. (5.8) is

(p) = 4 pp (p)|

=

2

12(2)5 (cid:2)p2pp  p4(cid:3) log(cid:18)p2  i0
m 2 (cid:19)

and satises the ward identity

p (p) = 0

(5.9)

(5.10)

as in qed.

as a last point, we discuss the normalization of t2(x, y)pse in the second
line of eq. (5.8) with singular order four from (5.9). actually, we should con-
sider the normalization of eq. (5.6) with singular order two, but owing to the
relation (5.9), the two analyses lead to the same conclusion. the normalization
terms have the form

n2(x, y)pse =: a(x)a(y) : (cid:0)  i n (x, y) (4)(x  y)(cid:1) ,

n (p) = n (p)(0)

 + n (p)(4)
 .

 + n (p)(2)

(5.11)

due to the same reasons as pointed out in sec. 4.4, the local normalization can
be expressed in momentum space through the polynomials

n (p)(0)
n (p)(2)
n (p)(4)

 = (cid:2)c1(cid:3) ,
 = (cid:2)c2pp + c3p2(cid:3) ,
 = (cid:2)c4p2pp + c5p4(cid:3) .

(5.12)

here, c1, . . . , c5 are undetermined real numbers and  := 2/12(2)5. requir-
ing (5.10) for n (p)(i)
, i = 0, 2, 4, we reduce the freedom in the choice of the
normalization parameters in the polynomials to

n (p)(0)

 = 0 ,

n(p)(4)

n(p)(2)

 = c2 (cid:2)pp   p2(cid:3) ,

 = c4 (cid:2)p2pp  p4(cid:3) .

19

(5.13)

(5.14)

the normalized photon self-energy tensor then reads

(p)n

 =(cid:16) pp

p2  (cid:17) (p2)n , with

(p2)n := (cid:20)p4 log(cid:18)p2  i0

m 2 (cid:19) + c2p2 + c4p4(cid:21) .

(5.15)

in order to x the remaining free parameters c2 and c4, we consider the total
photon propagator in momentum space, dened as the sum of the free photon
feynman propagator and an increasing number of self-energy insertions [7]

d(p)tot

the inverse of the total photon propagator is then

therefore, inverting the expression above, the total propagator reads

(5.17)

(5.18)

(5.19)

the explicit form of the function f (p2) is not important, because the last term
vanishes between transversal photon operators. photon mass- and coupling
constant normalization

= 0

and

(p2)n

p2

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)p2=0

(5.20)

yield c2 = 0. the last parameter c4 is non-essential, because it only shifts the
mass scale m . therefore, all local nite ambiguities in (5.11) can be reduced to
a single unknown normalization parameter.

this concludes our discussion of the loop graphs to second order in causal

perturbation theory.
