abstract

we study, using adhm construction, instanton eects in an n = 2 superconformal
sp(n ) gauge theory, arising as eective eld theory on a system of n d-3-branes
near an orientifold 7-plane and 8 d-7-branes in type i string theory. we work out
the measure for the collective coordinates of multi-instantons in the gauge theory
and compare with the measure for the collective coordinates of (1)-branes in
the presence of 3- and 7-branes in type i theory. we analyse the large-n limit
of the measure and nd that it admits two classes of saddle points: in the rst
class the space of collective coordinates has the geometry of ads5  s 3 which on
the string theory side has the interpretation of the d-instantons being stuck on
the 7-branes and therefore the resulting moduli space being ads5  s 3, in the
second class the geometry is ads5  s 5/z2 and on the string theory side it means
that the d-instantons are free to move in the 10-dimensional bulk. we discuss
in detail a correlator of four o(8) avour currents on the yang-mills side, which
receives contributions from the rst type of saddle points only, and show that it
matches with the correlator obtained from f 4 coupling on the string theory side,
which receives contribution from d-instantons, in perfect accord with the ads/cft
correspondence.
in particular we observe that the sectors with odd number of
instantons give contribution to an o(8)-odd invariant coupling, thereby breaking
o(8) down to so(8) in type i string theory. we nally discuss correlators related
to r4 , which receive contributions from both saddle points.

1 introduction

dualities, and in particular strong-weak coupling dualities, have shed light on our un-
derstanding of the dynamics of string theories and yang-mills theories. more recently
the conjecture of maldacena [1] relates the physics of certain conformally invariant large
n yang-mills theories living on 3-branes in various string theories to that of the cor-
responding bulk string theories in the near horizon geometry (ads geometry) of the
3-branes. many detailed checks have so far conrmed this conjecture and have at the
same time provided new insights into both the physics of yang-mills theories as well
as that of string theories. in a beautiful paper [2], in the context of n = 4 yang-mills
theories, this equivalence was extended to en orders. on the yang-mills side they
appear as instanton eects, while in the string theory they correspond to certain higher
derivative couplings induced by stringy instantons. what was remarkable was that in
the large n limit, the moduli space of su (n ) multi-instantons collapses into the center
of mass moduli that live on ads5  s5 as predicted by ads/ cft correspondence,
and a set of relative moduli whose action is that of a multi d-instanton action in the
underlying iib string theory. it was known through the works [3, 4] and [5] that the
latter contributes to certain r4 terms in the iib theory (r being the riemann tensor).
also, it was shown that certain correlators in the yang-mills instanton background, had
a direct correspondence with certain couplings appearing in the string theory via the
dictionary of the yang-mills operators and the bulk operators as given in [6, 7] .
the purpose of this paper is to extend the results of ref. [2] to the case of n = 2 sp(n )
yang-mills theories that appear as the 3-brane world volume theory in the type i model
where the 3-branes are living at an orientifold 7-plane together with 8 d-7-branes. the
near horizon geometry of this system is that of ads5  x5 where x5 is a particular z2
modding of s5. the 7-brane world volume intersects with x5 on an s3. this model
was rst studied in refs.
[8, 9] following the earlier works [10, 11]. subsequently the
order n corrections to the ads/cft trace anomaly in this model were analyzed in refs.
[12, 13]. in the bulk theory this correction was traced, in ref.
[13], to the presence of
an r2 term in the 7-brane world volume action.

in the present work we will consider instantons in the 3-brane world volume theory
and show that, in the large n limit, two types of saddle points are relevant: those for
which multi-instanton moduli space is ads5  s3, and the uctuations are given by the
d-instanton action in type i theory, and those for which the multi-instanton moduli
space is ads5  s5/z2, and the uctuations are given by the d-instanton action in type
iib theory. for the former saddle points the interpretation on the string side is that the
d-instatons sit at a point on the the 7-branes whereas for the latter ones they can be at
a point in the whole 10 dimensional bulk. we will study certain correlation functions,
in the yang-mills theory, of the o(8) avour currents that couple to o(8) gauge elds
in the bulk via ads/ cft correspondence. we will see that in the large n limit the

1

rst type of saddle points are relevant for these correlation functions. moreover, we
will show that these correlation functions describe the bulk to boundary propagators
that connect f 4 vertex to the o(8) currents on the boundary. the result then is
obtained by the d-instanton contributions to f 4 in type i theory or equivalently d-
string instanton contributions in type i theory [14, 15] or world sheet instantons at
string one-loop level in heterotic theory [16, 17]. we will see that both odd and even
instanton numbers contribute to this correlator. we will also see that certain correlators
can receive contributions from instanton congurations whose moduli space is the full
10-dimensional bulk spacetime ads5  s5/z2.
some of the issues developed here have been recently discussed in [18, 19]. also instanton
eects in su (n ) superconformal n = 2 gauge theories have been discussed in [20] and,
in the context of orbifold ads/cft correspondence, in [21]

the paper is organized as follows.
in section 2 we review the 3-brane world volume
theory and describe the relevant adhm construction of the multi-instantons. in section
3 we describe the adhm measure in terms of integrals over the elds on (1)-branes
in a system of (1)-, 3- and 7-branes. we then go on in section 4 to nd the saddle
point solutions in the large-n limit and show that the integral collapses to a center
of mass integral on ads5  s3 (i.e.
in the 7-brane world volume where o(8) gauge
elds live) or ads5  s5/z2, together with integrals over the uctuations describing
the relative positions of d-instantons in type i or iib theory respectively. for the rst
saddle point, we will see that both odd and even instantons contribute to the correlation
function involving four o(8) currents and give rise to odd and even quartic invariants
of o(8).
in section 5 we show that the four o(8) current correlators describe bulk
to boundary propagators connecting f 4 vertex in ads5 to four o(8) currents on the
boundary of ads5. we will explicitly show the emergence of the usual t8 tensor in f 4
vertex. in section 6, we describe the heterotic string computation of f 4 term for the
odd invariant case since this has not appeared in the literature so far. we will also
discuss r4 couplings, which receive contributions from both saddle points. finally in
section 7 we make concluding remarks.

2 adhm construction of n = 2 sp(n) instantons

the theory on the type i 3-branes that we are considering here is n = 2 sp(n )
yang mills theory with one hypermultiplet transforming under the antisymmetric rep-
resentation of sp(n ) and a fundamental hyper multiplet transforming as (n, 8) under
sp(n )  o(8) with o(8) being the avour symmetry arising from the 7-branes. the
following table includes the elds on the 3-brane world volume together with their
so(4)i  so(4)e  so(2) transformation properties. here the subscript i refers to
the so(4) of the world volume (writing so(4) = su (2)2, we shall label the quantum
numbers by , ), e refers to the external so(4) which is part of the 7-brane world

2

volume (a and y label the analogous quantum numbers) and nally so(2) acts on the
space transverse to the 7-branes.

it is instructive to compare the above elds with those of 2n 3-branes in type iib.
there the theory is n = 4 u (2n ) gauge theory. type i sp(n ) theory is obtained
from the n = 4 u (2n ) theory by   z2 projection (apart from the o(8) fundamental
elds which appear from 3-brane-7-brane states and we shall discuss them separately in
the following). recall that the n = 4 theory has an su (4) r-symmetry group which
can be decomposed in terms of so(4)e  so(2)  su (2)a  su (2)y  so(2) that
appears in the n = 2 theory. writing also so(4)i as su (2)  su (2)  we can write
the n = 4 elds (all in the adjoint of u (2n )) in terms of their representations under
su (2)  su (2)   su (2)a  su (2)y  so(2) as

the last entry here denotes the charge under so(2).
z2 projection acts as follows: z2 is the center of su (2)y , while  assigns a plus sign to
the sp(n ) subalgebra of u (2n ) adjoint and assigns minus to the remaining generators
of u (2n ) namely the ones transforming as the second rank anti-symmetric represen-
tation of sp(n ). from this it follows that vectors are sp(n ) adjoint and transform
as (2, 2, 1, 1, 0), while the scalars split into two classes: ay that transform as anti-
symmetric representation of sp(n ) and  transforming as adjoint. similarly fermions
transforming as (2, 1, 2, 1, +1) and their complex conjugate (1, 2, 2, 1,1) are in the ad-
joint of sp(n ) while the ones transforming as (1, 2, 1, 2, +1) and their complex conjugate
(2, 1, 1, 2,1) are in the antisymmetric representation. this is exactly the eld content

3

(apart from the fundamentals of o(8)) described above and in fact even their action is
just obtained from the n = 4 action by this projection. this fact will be important for
us in the following because our strategy will be to use the results of [2] for the case of
u (2n ) and project by  z2. not only the zero mode analysis of [2] can be adapted for
our case but even the action integrals can be carried over from the n = 4 analysis.

2.1 vector zero modes

in the u (2n ) theory the adhm data for k instanton is given in terms of (2n + 2k) 2k
matrix  of the form 1

i  = ai  + b

ix 

(2.1)

where  goes over 2n + 2k indices and the 2k indices are split into i = 1, . . . , k and
,  = 1, 2 and x  = x

 . the matrix  satises the constraint

( ) 

ij

ij  =  

 f 1

(2.2)

where fij is a symmetric matrix. another ingredient in the construction is u which is
a (2n + 2k)  2n matrix and satises the orthogonality relation u = u  = 0 and
u u = 1. the projection operator is u u = 1  f . the instanton gauge potential
v = u u gives a self dual eld strength of instanton number k.

we can now go to the sp(n ) case by projecting by  which implies that  and u
satisfy:

n +k = k,

n +ku = u n

(2.3)

where * denotes complex conjugation and r is a 2r  2r matrix with r diagonal blocks
of 2 each.

it is clear that  is dened up to the action of constant sp(n + k) from the left and
gl(k, r) from the right. sp(n + k) acts simultaneously on u on the left. u on the
other hand admits local sp(n ) transformations on the right. using the freedom on 
we can bring the matrix b in 2.1 to the form

b =  02n 2k
12k2k !

(2.4)

the residual symmetry of  is sp(n ) subgroup of sp(n +k) left action and o(k) action
dened by

   12n 2n

02k2n g  122 !  gt  122

02n 2k

(2.5)

with g being an o(k) element. this residual sp(n )  o(k) symmetry will play an
important role in the next section when we describe the adhm data using (1)-, 3-,
7-brane system.

1we use the same notation as ref. [2]

4

writing a =   w2n 2k

2k2k !, the constraint on  then implies that a is a symmetric

a

matrix (i.e. a
tensor under o(k). the constraint also implies that

(i)( j) = a

(j)( i)) and therefore transforms as the second rank symmetric

ij  tr2 c( ww + aa)ij = 0 c = 1, 2, 3.
dc

(2.6)
where  c are pauli matrices. note that dc is a kk antisymmetric matrix and transforms
in the adjoint representation of o(k). dc will play the role of the d-terms in the o(k)
it is also clear that w  transforms as a bi-
gauge theory of (1)-brane instantons.
fundamental of sp(n )  o(k) and the superscript on w indicates that it transforms as
a doublet of su (2) . these elds will play the role of (1)- brane - 3-brane states.

2.2 adjoint and antisymmetric fermion zero modes

now let us turn to the fermions. their zero modes can also be obtained by projecting
the zero modes for n = 4 u (2n ) theory. the result for the sp(n ) adjoint fermions is
(2.7)

(a

 )uv = u 

ifijb

uma

juv  u 

u bifij(mt )a

where ma is a constant (2n + 2k)  k matrix of grassmann variables. writing

the constraints on m are:

(f a

t )a

i a j + a

i ma

j = 0

(2.8)

(2.9)

y transforms in the anti-symmetric representation of o(k).

in particular this implies that m transforms in the symmetric representation of o(k).
similarly the zero mode expressions for the fermions y in the anti-symmetric repre-
sentation of sp(n ) are given by the above expressions with the collective coordinates
ma replaced by my and (mt )a replaced by (mt )y . this in particular implies that
m
the fermionic constraints f a
representations of o(k)respectively. note that ma
so(2) while my
is exactly the structure one nds in the (1)-, 3-, 7- brane system.
finally we will need the explicit expressions of the four supersymmetric and four super-
conformal exact zero modes. they are given respectively by choosing

 transform in the adjoint and the symmetric
 carry (+1) charge under

2.3 adjoint and anti-symmetric scalars

in the u (2n ) theory the adjoint scalar ab transforms as a vector under the so(6)r
symmetry. it satises the equation of motion

d2ab = 2i[a, b].

(2.12)

the solution is given by:

iab = 

1
22

u (maf mb  mbf ma)u + u  02n 2n

02k2n ab

02n 2k

kk  122 ! u (2.13)

where ab is the collective coordinate that satises the equation

with ab and the operator l dened as:

l  ab = ab

l  ab =

2{ab, w 0} + [a

(2.14)

(2.15)

where w 0 = tr2 ww. splitting again su (4)r symmetry into su (2)a  su (2)y  so(2)
and doing the   z2 projection, which projects ay and  into respectively anti-
symmetric and adjoint representation of sp(n ) we nd that the collective coordinates
ay and  transform as symmetric and adjoint representations of o(k) respectively.
also as a result of the projection, m in the above expressions are replaced by (mt )a
and (mt )y .

2.4 fundamental elds

as we mentioned, the theory we are considering also includes hypermultiplets that
transform as bi-fundamental of sp(n )  o(8). in fact we shall be precisely interested
in computing the correlation function of the o(8) avour currents. the fundamental
fermion zero mode is

u = u 
r

u b

ifijkr

j

(2.16)

where r is the o(8) avour index and ks are grassmann numbers that transform as
bi-fundamental of o(k)o(8). note that k does not transform under so(4)iso(4)e.

u couples to the scalar + through the term tr(+rr

since the spinor r
equation of motion for + has an additional term rr
the eect of this term is the addition of a term

), then the
 on the right hand side of(2.12).

(f )ij = kr

i kr

j

(2.17)

to the right hand side of equation (2.14) but only for the component +. in summary,
after the projection of the n = 4 u (2n ) result, which contains those elds of n =
2 sp(n ) which are in the adjoint and antisymmetric reps, the inclusion of the hypers in
the fundamental representation is just through the above modication of the constraint
for +.

2.5 multi-instanton measure

now we can write down the measure for k-instantons. it is just integration over the
collective coordinates discussed above together with the constraints (eqns. (2.6), (2.9)
and (2.14)):

da dw da dy dm
(f a

 ) (f y

a dm

y day d+ d dk

 ) (dc) (l  ab  ab

tot ) exp(

1
g2 trk  tot)

(2.18)

where tot =  + f . for later use, it is convenient to replace the integration over ay
and a by

ij and ba

ij are respectively symmetric

(2.19)

where bab is a 4k  4k matrix whose elements bay
and adjoint reps of o(k).

before analyzing the large n limit of this measure, it will be instructive to make a
comparison of the above measure with the one for d(1)-branes in the presence of
3-branes and 7-branes. this we will do in the next section.

3 adhm measure and d-instantons

in the last section, we discussed the adhm measure for the collective coordinates of
the k instantons in the sp(n ) gauge theory with the specic matter content appearing
on the type i 3-branes. in this section we will consider the higgs branch of a system
of k (1)-branes, n 3-branes and 8 of the 7-branes on an orientifold plane and will see
that, as it is expected [22, 23], it gives the same measure as the adhm analysis of the
last section. the eld content appearing on the world volume of the (1)-branes is

(3.3)

here the elds are classied according to their representations under so(k) gauge theory
of the world volume action of the (1)-branes, in which the sp(n ) and o(8) gauge
theories of the 3-branes and 7-branes respectively are the global symmetries. in addition
they carry specic representations of the so(4)e  so(4)i  so(2) which are the
rotation groups with e denoting the 4 directions transversal to 3-branes and longitudinal
to 7-branes, i denoting the 4 directions inside 3-branes world volume and so(2) denotes
the two transversal direction to the 7-branes. as before, the indices a and y refer to
the two su (2)s in so(4)e and  and  refer to the two su (2)s of so(4)i . it will be
useful to make comparison with the eld content for the (1)-, 3- brane system in type
iib that is relevant for the n = 4 theory. first of all, we have additional fermionic elds
k transforming as bi-fundamentals of so(k)  o(8) arising from open strings between
(1) and 7-branes. these describe the collective coordinates of the hyper multiplets in
the (2n, 8) of sp(n )o(8). secondly, the adjoint elds of the u (k) gauge theory in iib
splits into adjoint and symmetric representations of so(k) under the   z2-projection
as indicated above. finally the (1)-3-brane states satisfy a reality condition;

u =   uvw
w

the (1)-brane action for these elds is

note that the remaining action sd + sk has the following scaling invariance:

(3.4)

moreover one can easily see that the integration measure is also invariant under the
above scaling. from sd we obtain the d-term constraints. explicitly, integrating d, 
and  we nd the bosonic constraint:

(w c + (c) 


 (aa)
)[ij] = 0

and the fermionic constraints:

(3.7)

note that w 0 and w c are respectively symmetric and antisymmetric in ij.
it is now clear how the correspondence between the elds on the k (1)-branes and the
collective coordinates of the k instantons of previous section goes. the bosonic elds
a
  and w  correspond to the two components of the bosonic collective coordinate
ai . the other bosonic elds bay and ba correspond to the coordinates introduced
y , a, y and k correspond
with the same notation in (2.19). the fermions m
to the grassmann coordinates introduced with the same notation in section 2 when we
discussed the zero modes of adjoint, antisymmetric and fundamental fermions. moreover
we see that the constraints in (3.5) and (3.6) are exactly the same as the ones given in
last section and the action sk for the elds just mentioned is the the same as the action
in (2.19).

in order to integrate the delta function constraints (3.5) and (3.6), we decompose the
fermions s in terms of components s and s parallel and orthogonal to w respectively:

the integration over the 2  4k(n  k) fermionic variables (y , a) can be easily done
since they appear in the action as 1
g (abay y + aba + y b+y ). this then gives

the integration over 4k2 out of 2 (4k2) fermionic variables (y , a) can be done using
the delta-function constraints (3.6), which simply gives (det2k2kw )2k. note that this
factor cancels exactly (det2k2kw )2k coming from the jacobian of the transformations
(3.8). the remaining  integrations are over 2k(k  1) variables, y s, and 2k(k + 1)
variables, as.

for the integration over 4kn bosonic variables w 
ui, as in ref.[2], since the integrand is
only dependent on the gauge invariant matrix w , it is convenient to perform the angular
integrations. this can be done following the method explained in [2]. the steps involve
rstly to bring w into a standard upper triangular form by using the gauge invariance.
in our case, using sp(n ) gauge transformation:

the above action s, apart from the term kb+k, has exactly the same form as the
one appearing in equation (4.55) of ref. [2]. the dierence is that in the present case,
due to the -projection, the components of the variables bab,  a and ma belong to
dierent representations of so(k). thus the large n , saddle point analysis of [2] can
be adapted to our case, after keeping track of the above projection. therefore it will
suce to state the steps involved and then give the nal solution. one rst makes the

rescaling b  n b and raises the two determinants in (3.12) to an eective action

keeping only leading terms of order n . a class of solution to the saddle point equations,
modulo the so(k) gauge transformation, is obtained by setting to zero all the so(k)
adjoint variables ,b, with the symmetric ones, w 0, bay and a
  being diagonal. this
 (in r4) and sizes
corresponds to the k instantons having independent positions in x i
  and w 0
i with i = 1, . . . , k and  = 1, . . . , 4, given by the diagonal elements of a
respectively. moreover, the diagonal elements of bay give the positions i
a ( a = 1, 2, 3
) of the instantons on s3. in other words, each instanton is parametrized by a point
(x i

n, i, i

a) of ads5  s3.

actually in the present case this is not the whole story. we have also another class of
saddle point solutions which correspond to pairs of instantons splitting o the 7-brane
world volume and sitting at the mirror points in the transverse directions to the 7-

11

brane. to illustrate this let us consider k = 2r be an even number. in this case we can
take b to be diagonal (r  r) matrix times 2 and bay , a
  and w 0 to be diagonal
(r  r) matrix times 122 subject to the condition

b(+b) + bay bay = (w 1)0

(3.15)

if the r eigenvalues are dierent then the o(2r) gauge group is broken to the semidirect
product sr  (z2)r where sr is the permutation of the r eigenvalues and (z2)r acts by
reecting the eigenvalues of b (i.e. b  b). equation (3.15), together with the
gauge group sr  (z2)r then shows that this saddle point conguration corresponds to
r instantons on ads5  s5/z2 (in the covering space ads5  s5 there are 2r instantons
at the image points).

clearly there are also other saddle point solutions intermediate to the above two cases
where some of the instantons stay in the 7-brane world volume and others split o the
7-brane in pairs. moreover some of the eigenvalues may also coincide. but in all cases
the saddle point solution has a clear interpretation of k instantons forming subsystems
of single or bound instantons, some of them living in the 7-brane world volume and
others living in the bulk ads5  s5/z2

4 exact saddle points in the large-n limit

it has been argued in [2], in n = 4 context, that, after taking into account the uctu-
ations around the saddle point, the leading contribution to the integral, in the large n
limit, comes from the most degenerate conguration, corresponding to the k instantons
being of the same size and in the same position in r4 and s5, i.e. from the k-instanton
bound state in ads5  s5. the argument rests on the the analysis of the measure
when two of the eigenvalues become equal. in this limit some of the previously massive
variables become massless. the quadratic determinant of the bosonic variables there-
fore diverges in this limit. however in a supersymmetric theory the integration over
the would-be massless fermionic variables should cancel this divergence. to see this let
us consider k = 2 case in the n = 2 model under consideration (of course the same
consideration will also apply to the n = 4 model considered in [2]). there are two
possible generic saddle point solutions:

1)

2)

b = 0,
and bay , a
b = x2, and bay , a

 , w 0 diagonal with dierent eigenvalues,
 , w 0 proportional to 122

(4.1)

in the rst case the o(k) = o(2) is broken to z2 while in the second case it is unbroken.
in the rst case, to be explicit let us assume that the real part of only bay for a = y = 1
2in the case of an n = 4 sp(n ) gauge theory the coordinates (bay , b) are replaced by a six-
component vector of variables in the antisymmetric of o(k). the analog of (3.15) would then give,
together with the other bosonic coordinates, the moduli space (ads5  rp 5)r (for k = 2r), in agreement
with [25].

has dierent eigenvalues and all the other variables have equal eigenvalues. then the
o-diagonal components of bay ; (a, y ) 6= (1, 1), a
 , b, ms and s and the imaginary
part of b11, acquire masses that vanish in the limit the two eigenvalues coincide (note
that a certain combination of the o-diagonal components of w 0 and other elds have
quadratic terms that does not vanish in the limit of coinciding eigenvalues). let m be
the dierence of the eigenvalues of the real part of b11. we would now try to extract
the dependence of the measure on m . at rst sight it may appear that there are
9 o-diagonal bosons and only 16 real o-diagonal fermions whose masses vanish in
this limit, and therefore the integral over the massive variables diverges as m 9+ 16
2 =
m 1. however by using o(2) transformation one can always bring the real part of
b11 into diagonal form, with the jacobian of the transformation being d3b11  d2b11m
modulo the volume of o(2), where on the left hand side the 3 b11s are in the symmetric
representation of o(2) while on the right hand side we have the 2 diagonal b11s. in the
total measure therefore m cancels as is expected from supersymmetry.

in the second case, the fact that the measure is independent of the mass is even more
y and y in this case remain massless and the integration
straightforward to see. b, m
a, a and k cancel exactly as
over the massive bosonic bay and a
expected from supersymmetry.

  and fermionic m

the argument above can be easily extended to other values of k and for all the possible
saddle point solutions corresponding to subsystems of instantons in the 7-brane world
volume and in the full 10-dimensions. it is also easy to see that the same argument
applies to the n = 4 case considered in [2]; there is no divergence in the measure when
the two eigenvalues coincide.

what does then select the saddle point in [2] corresponding to collapse of all the instan-
tons to a common position and scale? the answer is that in all the other saddle points
there are more fermion zero modes than the 16 corresponding to the supersymmetric
and superconformal zero modes. indeed if there are subsystems of instanton bound
states, there would be center of mass of each of these subsystems resulting in more
fermion zero modes. in fact these extra fermion zero modes are the ones contained in
m and  (part of  which is parallel to w) in the decomposition of the fermion collective
coordinates m =   
m !. in other words these extra zero modes are not contained

in  and  that are parts of  and  that are orthogonal to w and w respectively. if
one considers yang-mills correlation functions involving operators that contain only 16
fermions then clearly these other saddle points cannot contribute. on the other hand
if one computes correlators involving more than 16 fermions, then as shown in [2], the
leading order term in large n limit comes when all the extra fermions (other that 16)
appear as  and  due to the fact that they transform as fundamental of su (n ) and
the su (n ) trace gives a factor of n for each pair of  and . thus to the leading order
in n only the saddle point corresponding to all the instantons at same position and of

13

same scale contribute.
in the n = 2 case under consideration the same argument applies. for any yang-mills
correlators, the leading order in n arises when one takes the maximum possible fermions
in the  and  part of the fermion collective coordinates. of course at any saddle point
there are at least 8 exact fermion zero modes coming from m and . precisely 8
exact zero modes appear when all the instantons sit in the 7-brane world volume at
a common position and with common size. thus yang-mills correlators that contain
only 8 fermion collective coordinates m (i.e. other than the o(8) fermion collective
coordinates k) will get contribution only from the saddle point corresponding to the
bound state of all the instantons on the 7-brane world volume. in the next section
we will consider such a correlation function involving four o(8) currents. however one
may also consider correlators involving more than 8 fermions.
if the extra fermions
can appear as  and  then the leading order in n is again given by the above saddle
point. but as we shall see in section 5, for correlators involving operators that couple to
kaluza-klein modes of closed string states on s5/z2 this leading order in n vanishes,
and one gets contribution from saddle points (for even k = 2r) that correspond to r
instantons sitting in ads5  s5/z2. anticipating these results, in the remaining part of
this section we analyse these two saddle points in detail, the one where all the instantons
sit at a common point in the 7-brane and second (for even k = 2r) when r instantons
sit in the bulk ads5  s5/z2.
in the rst case b = 0 and all the bay , a
  and w 0 are proportional to identity
matrix with the constraint bay bay = (w 1)0. one can then perform the analysis of
small uctuations around this conguration and arrive at the following measure for the
collective coordinates of k instantons:

5 yang-mills correlators in the instanton background

after having discussed the adhm measure and the exact saddle points in large n
limit, we now compute some yang-mills correlators in the instanton background. by

15

the ads/cft correspondence, these correlators will be given by certain bulk terms in
the eective action of the string theory living in the bulk. given the fact that the yang-
mills correlators will appear with the instanton action factor e2iky m and the relation
between y m to the complexied string coupling constant  in type i, the eective
action terms that will contribute are precisely the ones that get contribution from k d-
instantons. it is known via heterotic-type i-type i duality in 8-dimensions, that there are
terms like t8f 4 and t8r4 (and their supersymmetric partners) that get contribution from
world sheet instantons, d-string instantons and d-instantons in these three dual theories
respectively. these terms live in the 7-brane world volume in the type i theory. however
we will argue that there are also some bulk terms in the type i eective action (i.e.
living in 10-dimensions) of the form t8t8r4 and its supersymmetric partners that receive
corrections from d-instantons. we will rst compute some correlators in yang-mills
that in the large n limit receive contribution from the saddle point corresponding to all
instantons sitting on the 7-brane world volume and show that they can be reproduced as
coming from the t8f 4 and t8r4 terms in the 7-brane bulk theory. next we will consider
some correlator that selects the saddle point which corresponds to instantons sitting in
the bulk ads5  s5/z2 and show that they come from the t8t8r4 term in the string
theory.

the o(8) gauge potential couples to the avour current in the 3-brane world volume
theory via the term aa
a and d =
 + a is the sp(n ) covariant derivative. on the yang-mills side we are interested in
computing a 4-point function of the currents j a
 in the presence of sp(n ) instantons.
we will see below that this is sucient to soak the 8 exact gaugino zero modes and
moreover for odd instantons will soak also the 8 fundamental zero modes giving rise to
odd parity o(8) invariant. in the large n saddle point approximation, the correlation
function is just given by plugging in the classical solutions of the elds. first let us
consider the bosonic part of the o(8) current. the scalar eld  satises the equation:

d2q = 

(5.1)

where  and  are the gaugino and fundamental fermion elds. plugging in the expres-
sions for the zero modes of  and  as given in equations (2.7) and (2.16) in terms of
the adhm data, we can solve the above equation with the result:

u = u

(5.2)

where the index r and u label the fundamentals of o(8) and sp(n ) respectively,  runs
over 2n + 2k values, and i, j run from 1 to k.

the fermion part of the current at a  
a is a bit more tricky. at rst sight it
appears that this term cannot soak the 8 exact supersymmetric and superconformal
zero modes. indeed the zero mode of  does not contain ma collective coordinates
and   has no zero mode of the dirac operator. however a closer inspection shows
that one needs to solve the classical equation for   in the presence of the 8 exact zero
modes,

d    = (a

 qa + +)

(5.4)

note that this equation does not have a solution for arbitrary collective coordinates
ma. the reason for this is that the right hand side of the above equation has a non-
zero overlap with the zero modes for  given in (2.16) i.e. zero modes of the conjugate
operator d ). this is evident from the n = 2 analogue of the equation (3.7) of [2]
which reads

0 +  122 ! is the collective

coordinate of + appearing in (2.13). it is clear therefore that  is not in the image
of the operator d .

a careful analysis of the collective coordinate approach followed here (as well as in the
previous papers [2], and others) shows that in the correlator, in the leading semiclassical
approximation   should be replaced by the right hand side of eq.(5.6). however here
we will give a simple argument to prove this which is based on the fact that we need to
soak the 8 exact zero modes.

the right hand side of the expression in terms of collective coordinates is quadratic in
mas. since we need 8 exact zero modes and we have only 4 currents, it follows that
each of these mas must be replaced by the exact zero modes. therefore it suces to

17

solve eq.(5.4) in the presence of exact zero modes. in this case using eq.(2.14) one nds
+ = 0. this is due to the fact that mama = 0 for exact zero modes and the operator
l is a positive denite operator. as a result  is zero and eq.(5.6) solves eq.(5.4).

one can now, using eqs.(5.6),(2.16), compute the fermionic part of the o(8) current for
the 7-brane saddle point under consideration. the result turns out to be identical to
the bosonic part of the current, namely the right hand side of (5.3). thus the total o(8)
current is proportional to (5.3). it is also easy to check that the current is conserved
(j = 0).

the 8 exact gaugino zero modes can be grouped into an 8 component chiral spinor of 8
dimensional euclidean space as

s =

(5.8)

furthermore we will use the 8 dimensional (1616)  matrices introduced in (4.4). note
that  and 5 act on so(4)i indices  and , and that, from the two sets of sigma
matrices used, the rst one acts on the su (2)r index a, b while the second one acts on
the two chiralities of 8-dimensional euclidean space. moreover the charge conjugation
matrix c, as dened in section 4, raises and lowers the indices ,  and a. the current

in (5.13) js are the o(8) generators in the vector representation,  = a + i/gstr with
a being the type i 0-form rr potential and in the second equation on the right hand
side bis are totally symmetrized. note that the k odd term above gets contribution
only from the o(8) odd parity invariant. this could be seen directly at the level of
d-instanton action. indeed the the o(8)  o(k) fermions k couple only to the o(k)
gauge elds b+ in the d-instanton action. integrating the k therefore gives (det b+)4
in the vector representation of o(k). for odd k, b+ has always at least one zero mode
for generic values of b+. thus to get a non zero result one has to soak the fermion zero
modes, which is acomplished by the insertions of 8 k appearing in eq.(5.12), arising
from the four o(8) currents. soaking these zero modes brings about the 8-rank  tensor
in eq.(5.13) for odd k.

so far in the above discussion, the s3 part of the measure has played no role apart
from giving an overall volume factor. this is because we were considering correlators
of the o(8) currents which couple on the ads5 side to the lowest kaluza-klein modes
of the o(8) gauge elds on s3. there are two types of higher kaluza-klein modes one
can consider: that of the closed string states such as dilaton, graviton etc. and that of
the 7-brane world volume elds namely o(8) gauge elds. for the closed string elds
kaluza-klein modes will be on s5/z2 while for the 7-brane elds these modes will be
on s3 and therefore one would expect the integral to be on the 7- brane world volume
namely ads5  s3. in particular the correlators involving yang-mills operators that
couple to the kaluza-klein modes coming from the 7-brane elds, will get contribution
only from 7-brane saddle point. these correlators can be calculated exactly as in the
case of n = 4 theory discussed in [2] and one can show that they probe the s3 part of
the space-time.

19

5.2 correlators related to bulk r4 terms

we will now consider a correlator which will get contribution from the saddle point with
b 6= 0 that probes the full ads5  s5/z2. it is clear that such correlators must involve
operators that do not carry o(8) quantum numbers. such operators can therefore be
obtained by projection from the n = 4 operators. in the n = 4 context the operators
oab = trab in the (20) of so(6) (i.e. traceless symmetric tensor of 2 so(6) vectors,
with a, b here labelling the so(6) vectors) carry dimension 2, and they couple via
ads/cft correspondence to a certain kaluza-klein mode j of the scale factor h
 and
the 4-form potential c on s5. the combination j of these two elds given by

the projection to n = 2 splits (20) of so(6) into (3, 3)0, (1, 1)2 and (1, 1)0 of su (2)a
su (2)y  u (1), the representations (2, 2)1 being projected out. on the yang-mills
side these operators are respectively tray bx (where a, b and x, y are symmetrized),
tr()2 and tr+. on the ads side these operators couple to eld j mentioned above,
where the spherical harmonics y (2) is restricted to even ones under the z2 projection.
the simplest correlator is the one involving four operators o(3,3) = tray bx with
a, b and x, y symmetrized. in the large-n limit, we must replace the elds by their
classical solution with the result:

o(3,3) =

1
g2 tr u (mafmt y + my fmt a)u umbfmt xu

(5.16)

the correlator then would involve 8 mas which will soak the 8 exact zero modes,
leaving behind 8 my s. this correlator gets contribution from both the saddle points
described in the previous section:

1) when all the instantons sit at the same point in the 7-brane world volume (i.e.
b = 0). in this case using the fact that y appear in the action in the combination
ay bay + y y b+ and the fact that b+ = 0 in this saddle point, we conclude that all
y s and  y s. the scaling of (m)y and  y by gn 1/8 and
the 8 my s give rise m
the measure factor n g4 in eq.(4.2) gives rise to a term which goes as order one in g and
n times an o(2r) matrix theory correlator of 8 o(2r) adjoint fermions in the matrix
theory integral. in the supergravity theory this should correspond to 7-brane t8r4 and
t8(r2)2 terms together with the terms involving the 4-form potential. such terms via
t-duality and s-duality should be obtainable from the heterotic one loop computation
involving gravitons and anti-symmetric tensor elds.

20

2) when r instantons sit at a common point in ads5s5/z2 (with the other r instantons
sitting at the image point) there are 8 zero modes of my s as well that are not lifted
and the resulting matrix theory is that of su (r) theory of type iib instantons. thus
the result should be the same as in the type iib case where this correlator is expected
to get contribution from t8t8r4 (and terms involving 4-form potential). the measure
factor n can be understood as follows. the 10-dimensional integral of r4 goes as
l2  pg2n with l being the radius of s5. the factors of g cancel due to the fact

that the leading d-instanton contribution to r4 goes as 1/g [3, 4, 5]. note that in type
i theory, the 0-form rr eld  is not projected out and therefore the 10-dimensional
type iib d-instanton contributions would survive in type i theory.

6 string theory computation of f 4 terms

in this section we discuss the f 4 computation for so(8)4 heterotic theory in 8 dimen-
sions. the world sheet instantons of the heterotic theory are then mapped via s-duality
to d-string instantons in type i theory, which in turn are mapped via two t-dualities
to (1)-brane d-instantons in type i theory. in the present context of the near horizon
limit of the 3-branes lying at an orientifold plane where 8 of the 7- branes live, we are
interested in all the four f s in the same so(8) factor. there are three independent
quartic invariants of so(8):

tr f 4,

(tr f 2)2,

i1...i8fi1i2fi3i4fi5i6fi7i8

(6.1)

here tr denotes trace in the vector representation of so(8) and  is the 8-rank anti-
symmetric tensor in the vector representation, fij  fa(j a)ij with j a being the so(8)
generators in the vector representation. note that the rst two invariants are o(8)
parity even while the third one is o(8) parity odd due to the  tensor. the amplitudes
involving the rst two invariants, namely tr f 4 and (tr f 2)2, have already been computed
in [17, 18], with the result

f 2f 2
f 4

= 4[log |(4t )|4  2 log |(2t )|2]  4 log[t2u2|(u )|4],
= 

[log |(4t )|4  log |(2t )|2]

2

(6.2)

here t is the complexied kahler modulus of the torus t = b12+ir1r2. the coecient
of e2int in the above denotes the contribution of n world sheet instantons to the
amplitude. note that there are only even number of instantons contributing to these
two so(8) invariants. we shall now compute the last invariant, namely the o(8) parity
odd invariant. we will see that only odd instantons contribute to this term.
so(8)4 theory is best seen as a z2 z2 orbifold of heterotic so(32) theory compactied
on a torus of radii 2r1 and 2r2. the orbifold group is generated by two elements g and
h where g is half shift along rst direction together with the wilson line (sp, sp, 0, 0)
in the decomposition of so(32) in terms of so(8)4 and h is the half shift along the

21

second direction together with the wilson line (sp, 0, sp, 0). here sp = ( 1
2 )4 denotes
the highest weight of the spinor representation of so(8). including all possible twists
along  and t directions of the world-sheet torus, we nd 16 sectors which split into 5
modular orbits: one containing the completely untwisted sector, 3 orbits containing 3
sectors each and one orbit containing 6 twisted sectors. denoting by (a, b) the twisted
sectors with twist a along  and b along t directions, we can represent these orbits as
(1, 1) for the completely untwisted sector, (1, g), (1, h) and (1, gh) for the three orbits
containing 3 sectors each and nally (g, h) for the orbit containing 6 sectors. the rst 4
orbits contribute to the o(8) even parity invariants and they have been already studied
in [17, 18]. the last orbit represented by (g, h) contributes to the o(8) odd parity term.

the instanton numbers of course are governed by the windings along  and t directions.
let us denote by (n1, n2) the windings of (x1, x2) along  direction and (m1, m2) that
along t direction. world sheet instanton action is (2r1)(2r2)|n1m2  n2m1|. due to
shifts associated with g and h the windings in these representatives of the 5 modular
orbits are:

(1, 1)

(1, g)

(1, h)

(1, gh)

instanton number being invariant under the modular group, it is clear that in the rst
4 orbits the instanton action is even number times r1.r2 while in the last orbit it is
odd number times r1.r2.

let us consider the so(32) fermion partition function. in the (g, h) sector, we have a
twist along  direction by (sp, sp, 0, 0) and along t by (sp, 0, sp, 0). this means that the
characteristics of theta functions shift (in groups of four) by (1/2, 1/2), (1/2, 0), (0, 1/2)
and (0, 0) respectively. now in the original so(32) theory one has the sum over all
spin structures for all the 32 fermions simultaneously. the shifts in the characteristics
mentioned above imply that the partition function now becomes:

16
3 + 16

4 + 16

(6.4)

this partition function is of course zero because of the appearance of 4
1 in each term on
the right hand side. however since f 4 vertex operators contain 4 kac-moody currents,
they can in principle give non-zero answer. indeed if we take for instance the four kac-
moody currents to be in four dierent cartan directions of a given so(8), then one
of the terms in the right hand side will contribute since the eect of introducing these

22

currents is to take derivatives of the appropriate (, z) with respect to z at z = 0. the
result therefore becomes:

4

14

24

34

4 = 28424

(6.5)

remarkably 24 cancels the 1/24 coming from the partition function of the oscillator
modes in the bosonic string sector (the right moving sector) of heterotic string. left
moving part of the heterotic string, i.e.
the fermionic string sector, gives the usual
t8 tensor in the presence of 4 gauge eld vertices as can be easily seen in the green-
schwarz formalism. indeed each of the f vertex contains two green-schwarz fermions
that soak the 8 fermion zero modes in the light cone gauge and all the non-zero mode
determinants cancel due to space-time supersymmetry. thus the nal result for the
coecient z(t, u ) of the o(8) odd parity term i1...i8fi1i2fi3i4fi5i6fi7i8 is just given by
the 2-dimensional lattice sum of the windings.:

with ni and mi being integers. u is the complex structure of the torus and m is
the fundamental domain of the 2 subgroup of sl(2, z) dened as the set of matrices
  a b
c d ! with b and c even integers. note that m has 6 copies of the fundamental

domain of sl(2, z) owing to the fact that the orbit of (g, h) consists of 6 twisted sectors.
one can now use suitable elements of 2 to set n2 = 0 and the result is the unfolding of
the domain m to the full upper half plane. the integration over the upper half plane
yields the result:

z(t, u ) = 2(log |(t )|2)odd

(6.8)

where the subscript odd indicates projection onto odd powers of e2it . notice that there
is no u dependence since in this sector there is no degenerate orbit.

equations (6.2) and (6.8) give the complete f 4 terms in the so(8)4 heterotic theory
in 8-dimensions. in type i also one can do an analogous calculation involving d-string
instantons wrapped on the torus following the methods of [16, 15]. the basic idea
here is that in the infrared limit, the theory of n d-strings collapses into a symmetric
product of n copies of heterotic string (in the static gauge). the instanton contribution
is obtained by considering the one loop amplitude involving 4 f vertices with  and
t being identied with x1 and x2 respectively, as is dictated by the static gauge. we
will not give the details here but a trivial extension of the results of [16, 15] after
including the wilson lines in g and h yields the same result as the heterotic string one
loop result. finally in the type i theory which is obtained by 2 t-dualities on type i
theory, the coupling f 4 should be the same as in type i, however a direct computation
of d-instanton contributions in type i theory is an interesting open question.

7 conclusions

in this paper we studied the multi-instanton eects in n = 2 sp(n ) yang-mills theory
that appears in the 3-brane world volume in the type i theory (2 t-dual of type i).
we showed that the adhm construction of the multi-instantons gives rise to collective
coordinates which can be interpreted as the elds living in the (1)-brane instantons in
the presence of 3-branes in type i. the saddle points in the large n-limit describes (1)
brane instantons sitting at various points in the 7-brane world volume (ads5  s3) or
in the 10-dim bulk (ads5 s5/z2) that appears as the near horizon limit of the 3-brane
solutions. we further discussed the nature of the exact saddle points in the large-n
limit and argued that there are two distinct classes of exact saddle points, one where all
the instantons sit at the same point in the 7-brane world volume and the other when
all the instantons sit at a common point in the 10-dim bulk. the latter is of course
possible only for even number of instantons since there has to be an equal number of
instantons at a given point and its image under the z2 action. while the 7-brane saddle
point measure is order 1 in n , the bulk saddle point measure goes as n .
in the 7-brane saddle point there are 8 exact fermion zero modes and the measure splits
into an integral over ads5s3 times a matrix integral over the (1) brane world volume
theory (o(k) gauge theory) that appears in type i where the center of mass variables
have been factored out. this matrix integral via 2 t-dualities is related to d-string
instanton integrals in type i (which can be evaluated in the matrix-string approach of
[27]) and via a further s-duality is related to 1-loop world-sheet instantons in heterotic
theory. we computed 4 o(8) current correlator in the yang-mills theory which receives
contribution only from the 7-brane saddle point as is to be expected from the fact the
o(8) gauge elds live only in the 7-brane world volume, and showed that the result is
obtainable from f 4 terms in the 7-brane world volume via ads/cft correspondence.
a novel feature we nd is that also the odd instantons contribute to such correlators in
the yang-mills side and to f 4 term on the string theory side where it appears as o(8)
odd parity quartic invariant. in particular this shows that bps instantons break o(8)
to so(8) in contrast with the situation in 10-dimensional type i theory where o(32) is
broken to so(32) due to the non bps z2 instanton [28].

we also discussed some yang-mills correlators that do not involve o(8) quantum num-
bers. in this case only the even instantons contribute and both the saddle points are
relevant. these correlators are given by the r4 couplings (and their supersymmetric
partners) on the 7-brane world volume and in the 10-dimensional bulk respectively for
the two saddle points:

1) the 7-brane r4 coupling is of the form t8r4 and t8(r2)2 that appears via t and
s-duality at 1-loop in the heterotic theory. the (1)-brane instanton contribution to
such term is given by 1-loop world sheet instanton eects in the heterotic theory. these
are the super invariants i1 and i3 in the notation of [29], which are related to anomaly

24

cancelling cp odd term and therefore are expected to satisfy non-renormalization the-
orem.
in the type i side this result should be obtainable by computing 8 fermion
correlator (these are the zero modes that are lifted and carry (1) charge under o(2)
r-symmetry) in the o(2k) matrix integral (where the center of mass has been factored
out). it is an interesting open problem to work out this matrix integral and show that
it correctly reproduces the tensor structure of the i1 and i3 invariants as well as the
coecients in the instanton expansion. however we expect this to be true due to the
non-renrmalization theorem associated with these invariants.

2) more interesting and perhaps somewhat unexpected is the contribution of the 10-dim
bulk saddle point. in this case besides the 8 exact supersymmetric and superconformal
zero modes (that transform as (2, 1)+1 under su (2)asu (2)y o(2)) there are 8 more
exact fermion zero modes that transform as (1, 2)1. the measure factorizes into an
integral over the bulk ads5  s5/z2 together with these 16 fermion zero modes times
su (k) matrix integral (where 2k is the number of instantons) appearing in the type
iib context. this is exactly the situation for the k type iib (1) brane instantons
and therefore should produce t8.t8r4 term (and its supersymmetric partners). this
superinvariant (called i0 in [29]) appears at the tree level and the one loop torus level
in type i and type i (since the computation is the same as in type iib) as well as at
the tree level in the heterotic theory. i0 superinvariant is not expected to satisfy any
non-renormalization theorem. indeed it has been argued in [29] that the heterotic-type
i duality demands that i0 receives correction to all loops already in the 10-dimensional
iib on t 2/z2.(1)fl.) the
theory.
(1)-brane instantons of the iib theory are not projected out. therefore in the large
volume limit of t 2 we expect the (1)-brane instanton contributions to the i0 in iib
theory in 10-dim to survive. this is exactly the term which contributes to the instanton
eects in the corresponding yang-mills correlators arising from the bulk saddle point.
in fact this saddle point is dominant and goes as n in the large n -limit, due to the
fact that integral is also over the 2-directions transverse to to 7-brane and its volume
goes as gstn (the factor gst cancels from the 1/gst that appears in the leading
instanton contribution to r4 [3, 4, 5]).

in the type i theory under consideration (i.e.

an interesting open question is what is the fate of the type i i0 invariant in type i and
heterotic theory. by the duality relations one nds that the leading instanton term in
type i is mapped to

where subscripts i , i and h refer to the variables in the three theories, and t is the
volume of the torus. note that in the heterotic theory this expression does not make
sense due to the odd power of gh . this problem already appears at the 10-dimensional

25

level, as discussed by [29] with a possible resolution being that both in type i and
heterotic side this term should receive corrections to all orders.
