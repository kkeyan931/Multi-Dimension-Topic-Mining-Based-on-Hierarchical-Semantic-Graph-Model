abstract

the non-perturbative equivalence of four-dimensional n = 2 superstrings with three vector
multiplets and four hypermultiplets is analysed. these models are obtained through freely
acting orbifold compactications from the heterotic, the symmetric and the asymmetric type
ii strings. the heterotic scalar manifolds are (su(1, 1)/u(1))3 for the s, t, u moduli sitting
in the vector multiplets and so(4, 4)/(so(4)so(4)) for those in the hypermultiplets. the
type ii symmetric duals correspond to a self-mirror calabiyau threefold compactication
with hodge numbers h1,1 = h2,1 = 3, while the type ii asymmetric construction corresponds
to a spontaneous breaking of the n = (4, 4) supersymmetry to n = (2, 0). both have
already been considered in the literature. the heterotic construction instead is new and we
show that there is a weak/strong coupling s-duality relation between the heterotic and the
asymmetric type iia ground state with 4shet = (4sas)1; we also show that there is
a partial restoration of n = 8 supersymmetry in the heterotic strong-coupling regime. we
compute the full (non-)perturbative r2 and f 2 corrections and determine the prepotential.

1 introduction

in four space-time dimensions, string solutions with n  4 supersymmetries can be con-
structed, through appropriate compactications of the six-dimensional internal manifold,
from any of the perturbative ten-dimensional strings: heterotic, type i, type iia or type iib.
although these constructions appear dierent at the string perturbative level, they might
be non-perturbatively equivalent, provided the massless spectrum and the number of super-
symmetries is the same [1][3]. as far as n = 4 supersymmetry is concerned, several tests in
favour of the non-perturbative duality equivalence have been presented in the literature, not
only in the case of the heterotic string compactied on t 6 versus the type iia, b compacti-
ed on k3  t 2[1], but also for theories with a lower number of massless vector multiplets
[4], including the type iia, b n = 4 asymmetric, freely acting, orbifold constructions [5].

in the n = 4 theories the space of the moduli elds is restricted by supersymmetry to

be the coset [1, 6]:

where r = 16 in the heterotic and type iia, b compactied on t 6 and k3  t 2, respectively.
models with lower rank, r < 16, can be constructed, via freely acting (asymmetric) orbifold
compactication, from any of the perturbative superstring theories in ten dimensions [4, 6, 5].
on the heterotic side, the dilaton shet is always in the gravitational multiplet, while on
the type ii side it is either one of the moduli of the vector multiplets (sii = t 1), when
the compactication is leftright-symmetric, with n = (2, 2) supersymmetry, or in the
gravitational multiplet in the asymmetric compactication with n = (4, 0) supersymmetry.
the non-perturbative string duality therefore implies interchanges between the moduli elds
shet and t i of the scalar manifold [1, 4, 5], with the perturbative states of one string theory
mapped to non-perturbative states of its dual equivalent and vice versa [4, 5, 7, 8]. the non-
perturbative equivalence of dual strings has been veried on several occasions: for instance,
the anomaly cancellation of the six-dimensional heterotic string implies that there should be
a one-loop correction to the gravitational r2 term in the type ii theory. such a term was
found by direct calculation in [4, 9]. its one-loop threshold correction, upon compactication
to four dimensions, implies instanton corrections on the heterotic side, due to ve-branes
being wrapped around the six-torus. several other indications are given for dual n = 4
theories with rank r < 16 [4].

heterotic/type ii dual pairs with lower supersymmetry, n = 2, share properties similar
to those of n = 4. in general (non-freely-acting) symmetric orbifolds still give rise to n = 2
heterotic/type ii dual pairs in four dimensions [10][12]. on the heterotic side they can be
interpreted as k3 plus gauge-bundle compactications, while on the type ii side they are
calabiyau compactications of the ten-dimensional type iia theory. the heterotic dilaton
is in a vector-tensor multiplet, dual to a vector, and the vector moduli space receives both
perturbative and non-perturbative corrections. the hypermultiplet moduli space, however,
does not receive perturbative corrections; if n = 2 is assumed to be unbroken, it does not
receive non-perturbative corrections either. the dilaton in the type ii (symmetric) construc-
tions is in a tensor multiplet, dual to a hypermultiplet, and the prepotential for the vector

1

multiplets receives only tree-level contributions. the tree-level type ii prepotential was com-
puted and shown to give the correct one-loop heterotic result. this provides a quantitative
test of the duality [10, 12] and allows us to reach the non-perturbative corrections of the
heterotic side.

in the quantitative tests of non-perturbative dualities, extended supersymmetry plays an
essential role, since it allows for the existence of bps states (states in short representations
of the supersymmetry algebra). these states are (generically) non-perturbatively stable and
provide a reliable window into non-perturbative corrections to some terms of the eective
action that receive contributions only from those states. the relevant structures for this
analysis are the helicity supertrace formulae, which distinguish between various bps and
non-bps states [4, 13][16]. for n  2, these supertraces appear in particular in the f 2 and
r2 (two-derivative) terms or in a special class of higher-order terms constructed out of the
riemann tensor and the graviphoton eld strength [17]. in the four-dimensional heterotic
string, these terms are anomaly-related and it can be shown that they receive only tree- and
one-loop corrections. in higher dimensions, they do not receive non-perturbative corrections
either [18].

the non-perturbative equivalence of some heterotic/type ii dual pairs with n = 2 su-
[5, 11, 19, 20]. in this class of n = 2 models

persymmetry has been investigated in refs.
the scalar manifolds are coset spaces:

su(1, 1)

u(1)



so(2, 2 + nv )

so(2)  so(2 + nv )

and

so(4, 4 + nh )

so(4)  so(4 + nh)

,

(1.2)

describing the moduli space of the nv + 3 moduli in vector multiplets and the nh + 4 in
the hypermultiplets, respectively. the type ii symmetric duals correspond to self-mirror
calabiyau threefold compactications with hodge numbers h1,1 = nv + 3 = h2,1 = nh + 3,
which are k3 brations, necessary condition for the existence of heterotic duals [21, 22].
the equivalence of heterotic/type ii model(s) with nv = nh = 8 was studied in refs.
[11, 19, 20]; recently, in ref. [20], this analysis has been extended to type ii and heterotic
duals with nv = nh = 4 and 2.

the purpose of this work is to extend the analysis of ref.

[20] and establish the non-
perturbative equivalence of three dierent n = 2 constructions with nv = nh = 0: the
heterotic construction with supersymmetry n = (2, 0), the symmetric type ii construction
with n = (1, 1) and the asymmetric type ii with n = (2, 0) supersymmetry. all these con-
structions are based on six-dimensional freely acting (asymmetric) orbifold compactications
and thus the initial n = 8 (in type ii) or n = 4 (in heterotic) supersymmetry is sponta-
neously broken to n = 2 [14]. the heterotic scalar manifold of this n = 2 construction is
described by the vector scalar manifold (su(1, 1)/u(1))3 associated to the three moduli s, t
and u, and by the hypermultiplet quaternionic one, so(4, 4)/(so(4)  so(4)). the type
iia symmetric construction corresponds to a self-mirror calabiyau threefold compacti-
cation with hodge numbers h1,1 = h2,1 = 3 [5]. the type ii asymmetric construction [5]
corresponds to a spontaneous breaking of n = (4, 4) to n = (2, 0) supersymmetry [14].

in section 2 we construct the symmetric type ii model with n = (1, 1) supersymmetry
and calculate the one-loop gravitational corrections associated to the r2 term. the asym-

2

metric type ii n = (2, 0) construction is presented in section 3; in the same section we
show that the r2 corrections in the two type ii dual theories are in agreement with their
non-perturbative equivalence. the heterotic construction, as well as the corresponding cor-
rections to the gauge and gravitational couplings, are presented in section 4. in section 5 we
compare the heterotic, the type ii symmetric and the type ii asymmetric corrections, and
show that the non-perturbative equivalence of the three models is veried; we furthermore
show that due to this triality equivalence, there exists a weakstrong coupling relation (s-
duality) between the heterotic and the asymmetric type ii theory (4shet = (4sas)1).
we also claim that the n = 8 supersymmetry is restored in the heterotic strong coupling
regime. finally, in section 6 and in the appendix, we derive the perturbative prepotential,
as well as part of its non-perturbative corrections, which are argued to be valid for all three
dual theories. our conclusion and comments are given in section 7.

2 the n = (1, 1) type ii symmetric construction

we start by considering a type ii symmetric construction with n = (1, 1) supersymmetry
and no vector multiplets or hypermultiplets in the twisted sector. this model is obtained by
compactication of the ten-dimensional type ii string on a calabiyau manifold cy(3,3), with
hodge numbers h1,1 = h2,1 = 3. this compactication reduces the n = (4, 4) supersymmetry
to the desired n = (1, 1). in what follows we will always work at the z (1)
(freely acting)
orbifold limit of this manifold, where the partition function and the one-loop gravitational
and gauge corrections can be computed analytically.

model can be written easily in terms of the characters of the twisted and shifted com-

superpartners i and i. the remaining contribution to the partition function comes from
the left- and right-moving non-compact supercoordinates x , , x ,  and the super-
reparametrization ghosts b, c, ,  and b, c, , . the resulting partition function reads:

(2.3)

where 2,2(cid:2)h

g(cid:3) is the z2-shifted (2, 2) lattice sum. as usual, the shift has to be specied by

the way it acts on the momenta and windings (our conventions are those of refs. [4, 20, 24]).
since the three complex planes of t 6 are translated, there are no xed points. therefore
there are no extra massless states coming from the twisted sectors: the massless spectrum of
this model contains the n = 2 supergravity multiplet, 3 vector multiplets, 1 tensor multiplet
and 3 hypermultiplets. the tensor multiplet is the type ii dilaton multiplet and is equivalent
to an extra hypermultiplet.

by using the techniques developed in refs.

[14, 23, 24], it can be shown that this
model possesses an n = 8 supersymmetry spontaneously broken through a super-higgs
phenomenon, due to the free actions of z (1)
2 . there exist appropriate limits of the
moduli, which depend on the precise shifts in the lattices, in which there is an approxi-
mate restoration of 16 or 32 supercharges. in such limits, the supersymmetry restoration
is accompanied by a logarithmic instead of a linear blow-up of the various thresholds. the
logarithmic blow-up is an infrared artefact, which can be lifted by switching on an infrared
cut-o  larger than the mass of the extra massive gravitinos; the thresholds thus vanish, as
expected, in the limit m3/2/  0 in which supersymmetry is extended to n = 8.

helicity supertraces b2n. these are dened as the vacuum expectation value of(cid:0)q + q(cid:1)2n

the relevant quantities for the computation of the string correction to the r2 term are the
,
where q, q stand for the left- and right-helicity contributions to the four-dimensional phys-
ical helicity. for the details of the computation of such quantities in the framework of the
above models we refer to previous publications [20, 24]. here we simply quote the results. a
straightforward computation shows that b2 = 0, as expected in the models with nv = nh
[20]. this feature is common to all the n = 2 type ii z2  z2 symmetric orbifolds [25],
in which b2 can receive a non-zero contribution only from the n = (1, 1) sectors of the
orbifold. the internal coordinates in these sectors are twisted; all corrections are therefore
moduli-independent and come from the massless states only. one nds b2 = b2|massless,
which vanishes in the model we are considering here.

on the other hand, b4 receives non-zero contributions from the n = (2, 2) sectors of the

orbifold, and we nd1:

b4 = 6 xi=1,2,3x(h,g)

2,2(cid:20)0|h

(2.4)

1the prime summation over (h, g) stands for (h, g) = {(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)}.

4

from (2.4), by applying the techniques developed in [24], one can see that there is a limit
in moduli space in which b4 vanishes; this is the signal of the restoration of the n = 8
supersymmetry.

3

the four-derivative gravitational correction we consider here is similar to those that
were analysed in refs.
[4] and [20]; in order to obtain it we proceed as in [20]. there
is no tree-level contribution to this operator, and the r2 correction appears at one loop;
it is related to the contribution of the h1,1 moduli, obtained through the insertion, in the
2
one-loop partition function, of the two-dimensional operator 2q2q
. in this class of mod-

els the contribution of the n = (1, 1) sectors to b4 vanishes, and therefore d2q2q

2e is

b4|massless
iia is the type iia string scale
and (iia) is the type iia infrared cut-o. besides this running, the one-loop correction
contains, as usual, the thresholds iia, which account for the innite tower of massive string
modes. the threshold corrections to the r2 term are related to the infrared-regularized
genus-one integral of b4/3. this relationship can be made more precise by noting that
it also accounts for
terms such as f 2 or h 2. however, in the type iia string, the r2 corrections depend on the
kahler moduli t 1, t 2 and t 3 (spanning the vector manifold), and are independent of the
complex-structure moduli u 1, u 2 and u 3 (spanning the scalar manifold) [4, 20]. we thus
have

the shifts on the (i)
2,2 lattices break the sl(2, z)t i duality groups, and the actual subgroup
left unbroken depends on the kind of shifts performed (see refs.
[4, 20, 23, 24]). further-
more, there are three n = 4 restoration limits, corresponding to ( im t 1, 1/ im t 2)  0,
( im t 1, im t 3)  0 or (1/ im t 2, im t 3)  0. the masses of the three extra pairs of

and each of them vanishes in one of the above limits. owing to the eective restoration of
the n = 4 supersymmetry, there is no linear divergence in the volume of the decompactifying
manifold. for example, when (1/ im t 2, im t 3)  0, we observe the following leading
behaviour:

 2 log im t 2 + 2 log im t 3 .

3 the n = (2, 0) type ii asymmetric construction

we now consider the asymmetric type ii orbifold, which is obtained from the n = 8 iia
superstring compactied on t 6 by applying the freely acting projections z fr
2 . the
latter is the same projection we considered in the previous section: it acts as a combination
of rotation and translation, and it reduces symmetrically the number of supersymmetries by
one half. instead, z fr
acts as ()fr together with a translation on t 6, and projects out all
the right-moving supersymmetries. the properties of the n = 4 model obtained by applying
2 were already analysed in [4]. the orbifold obtained by further application of z (1)
only z fr
has an n = (2, 0) supersymmetry realized among the left-movers only.

the massless spectrum contains, besides the supergravity multiplet, 1 vector-tensor mul-
tiplet, dual to a vector, 2 vector multiplets and 4 hypermultiplets: it is therefore the same

6

as that of the type ii symmetric orbifold. however, there is an important dierence in the
nature of the elds: in this case the dilaton belongs to a vector multiplet. this is a general
property of all n = (2, 0) string compactications, where supersymmetry charges involve
left-movers only. the reason is that the dilaton, in such cases, is uncharged under the su(2)
operators that rotate the supercharges of the n = 2 supergravity.

the three vector moduli are in this case the dilaton sas, the kahler class tas, and the
complex structure uas of the rst torus. when (h 1, g1) = (0, 0), expressions (3.1) and (3.2)
give half the partition function of an n = (4, 0) asymmetric orbifold with gauge group u(1)6.
this model was analysed in detail in ref. [4].

2 and z fr

by using the same techniques as for the type ii symmetric orbifold, it can be shown that
the model at hand possesses a spontaneously broken n = 8 supersymmetry, due to the free
action of z (1)
2 . this can be seen again from the analysis of the helicity supertraces.
we nd that b2 is a constant also in this asymmetric construction. there are therefore no
n = 2 singularities, i.e. lines in moduli space with enhancement of the massless spectrum
such that nv 6= nh . on the other hand, for nite values of the moduli, there are no
n = 4 singularities either (lines where nv = nh ), because the bosonic vacuum energy
is 1/2, and there are no points in moduli space in which new massless states can appear.

the helicity supertrace b4 receives non-zero contributions from three n = 4 sectors:
the n = (4, 0) sector with (h 1, g1) = (0, 0), the n = (2, 2) sector with (h 1, g1) 6= (0, 0)
and (h f , gf ) = (0, 0), and the n = (2, 2) sector with (h 1, g1) 6= (0, 0) and (h f , gf ) =
(h 1, g1). we obtain:

(3.3)

the contributions of the rst line come from the n = (4, 0) sector, while those of the second
line are due to the n = (2, 2) sectors.

(2.4).

expression (3.3) has to be compared with the analogous for the type ii symmetric orb-
in both cases b4|massless = 18, in agreement with the expected n = 2
ifold, eq.
supergravity result. as in the type ii symmetric orbifold, we can make b4 vanish by taking
appropriate limits in the space of moduli belonging to vector multiplets and hypermultiplets.
in the asymmetric type ii the vector-multiplet moduli are the moduli of the rst complex
plane tas, uas. the moduli of second and third complex planes belong to the hypermultiplet
space. the lattice sum in the second line of (3.3) vanishes in some appropriate limits in
tas and uas. however, only by taking further limits in some of the moduli belonging to

hypermultiplets can we make also 6,6(cid:2)0,h f

0,gf(cid:3) vanish. this is precisely the limit in which the

extra massive gravitinos of the asymmetric construction become massless.

as was already pointed out in the framework of symmetric type ii constructions, the
r2 gravitational corrections of the asymmetric case do not receive any contribution beyond
one loop. these corrections are related to the insertion of the operator 2q2q
. again,

this amplitude accounts for more terms (like h 2) and only half of it is relevant to the r2.
therefore, the only non-zero contribution is provided by one sixth of the n = (2, 2) sectors
of b4 (the second term in eq. (3.3)). the part of b4 associated with the n = (4, 0) sector
does not enter in the r2 correction and thus the moduli dependence comes from the vector
multiplets only; there is no dependence at all on the hypermultiplet moduli, as expected
from general properties of the n = 2 theories. both moduli tas and uas of the rst plane
belong to vector multiplets and appear in the correction to the r2 term.

with the specic choice of half-unit shift, ()m1g1, induced by z (1)

2,2, we ob-
tain the corrected gravitational coupling in terms of the moduli tas, uas, and the appropriate
string scale and infrared cut-o:

this expression deserves some comments, as was for (2.6). we rst observe that the z (1)

a restoration of an n = (4, 0) supersymmetry with no linear behaviour either in im tas or
in 1/ im uas; the remaining contribution is logarithmic:

(3.5)

finally, comparison of (2.6) and (3.4) suggests that the string duality map implies the
following identication of the moduli:

tas  t 2 , uas  t 3 and 4sas  1/t 1 .

(3.6)

the identication of the asymmetric dilaton sas with the h1,1 moduli t 1 of the symmetric
type ii construction follows from the behaviour in the limit im t 1  0, which corresponds,
in the asymmetric construction, to the perturbative limit sas  .

c = (0, 16) conformal block. the resulting characters are described by those of 32 right-
moving isings . the z (f)
2 projection reduces the initial n = 4 supersymmetry to n = 2; it
acts as a  rotation in t 4 left and right (super)coordinates and as a translation in t 2. its
action on a is non-trivial (see below), and it is chosen in such a way that neither vectors nor
hypers are produced from the as. in this way the heterotic massless spectrum is identical
to that of the previous type ii constructions. namely, it consists of the n = 2 supergravity
multiplet, 1 vector-tensor multiplet that contains the dilaton shet and is dual to a vector,
2 vector multiplets associated with the kahler class t and the complex structure u of the
torus3 t 2, and 4 hypermultiplets, obtained by pairing the left-moving negative eigenvalues
of the projection z (f)

in both constructions  and , the massless contribution to the b2 vanishes for generic
values of the moduli t and u, as it should for models where nv = nh. owing to the
z (f)
2 -translation on the two-torus, the n = 4 supersymmetry is spontaneously broken. the
analysis of these constructions is the same as for the models discussed in [20], to which we
refer for the details. here we simply recall that the construction based on  is not suitable
for a comparison with the type ii ground states: the region in the space of (discrete) wilson
lines which allows for an easy identication of the map between the moduli of the dual
models is the one that corresponds to the construction based on . in the latter, and for the
particular z (f)

(4.15)

the n = 4 supersymmetry is restored when r1 =p im t / im u is large. for large values of

im u/ im t we recover instead a genuine n = 2 non-freely-acting orbifold. for the specic
directions of the shifts in the two-torus that we have chosen, there are lines in the (t, u)-
plane along which two extra hypermultiplets appear in the massless spectrum together with
two extra massless vectors leading to an su(2) enhancement of one of the u(1)s of the
torus.

4.2 the gravitational corrections

in order to obtain heterotic gravitational corrections analogous to those of the type ii con-
structions (see eqs. (2.6) and (3.4)), we must proceed as follows. instead of considering the
pure r2 term, we must compute the one-loop corrections for a special combination of gravi-
tational and helicity operators. the ordinary r2-term correction is given by the genus-one
amplitude of

q2

grav is the usual gravitational
where q stands again for the left-helicity operator, and p
operator: when inserted in the one-loop vacuum amplitude, it acts as 1
  on 1/ im  2;
2i
namely, it acts on the contribution of the two right-moving transverse space-time coordinates
x =3,4, including their zero-modes. this latter fact is responsible for the appearance of a
non-holomorphic gravity-backreaction contribution, which ensures modular covariance but
has no type ii counterpart, as was discussed in [20]; the one-loop amplitude of the above
operator is6

the massless contribution to fgrav is precisely the gravitational anomaly, bgrav = 24nv +nh

which in the case at hand equals 2 (b2|massless vanishes), at generic points of the (t, u)
moduli space.

12

the operator p

2
grav is not suitable for comparison with the type ii result, because it is
not holomorphic and its amplitude is sensitive to the n = 2 singularities occurring in the
(t, u) plane: the corresponding beta-function (i.e. the gravitational anomaly) jumps along
2
grav with an appropriate
rational lines where nv 6= nh. we must therefore replace p
2
holomorphic operator p
grav whose amplitude is regular everywhere in (t, u), at least in the
model constructed with , which is the model we will be analysing in the following. to this
purpose, we introduce two operators: h tw and p

2
2,2.

the operator h tw acts, for any (h f, gf)-twisted sector of the orbifold, as a derivative

5 comparison of the three duals

grav = q2 p
2
grav = 2q2q

in this section we would like to test the triality relation between all three freely acting
orbifolds we have considered, through the analysis of the gravitational corrections. first
2
2
of all we observe that the operator q2
grav with p
grav given in (4.21), coincides, on
type ii side, with the operator qii2
we considered in sections 2 and 3. indeed,
owing to the absence of perturbative ramondramond charges, the contribution of the dual
2
grav vanishes; because of the symmetry between left- and right-movers on the world-sheet,
of p
there is no need for us to introduce an operator such as h tw, the insertion of qii2
grav being
automatically holomorphic. the duality among the three orbifolds requires the identication
of one of the three perturbative vector multiplet moduli of the type iia symmetric orbifold,
with the dual of the eld shet, the dilatonaxion eld of the heterotic theory, and with the
inverse of sas, the dilatonaxion eld of the type ii asymmetric theory. modulo sl(2, z)
transformations, such modulus can be indierently any one of the three t i, i = 1, 2, 3. for
deniteness, we will choose t 1, as was anticipated in (3.6). in order to see what the precise
duality map is, we consider all three models in their n = 4 phase.
in this limit, the

heterotic amplitude(cid:10)q2
in the type ii(cid:10)qii2

grav(cid:11) is expected to receive contributions from genus zero only, while
grav(cid:11) should vanish in the asymmetric orbifold and depend on one complex

modulus only in the type iia symmetric one. this behaviour can be checked by taking the
appropriate n = 4 limits in the three models (see eqs. (2.8), (2.9), (3.5) and (4.15), (4.25)).
the other surviving contributions, with a logarithmic dependence on the other moduli, are
in fact infrared artefacts due to an accumulation of massless states, which can be lifted, in
all the three models, by switching on an infrared cut-o larger than the massive gravitinos,
as we previously discussed. by comparing eq. (2.9) with the genus-zero contribution in eq.
(4.27) (16 2 im shet), we obtain

t 1 =


2

shet = 2shet .

(5.1)

here we have introduced the eld s  4s, the actual modular parameter of the
montonenolive s-duality transformations. since, after an sl(2, z)t inversion t  1/t ,
the model becomes symmetric under permutations of the elds shet, t and u, the behaviour
of the eective coupling constant, for large values of the three moduli, must be symmetric as
well; this requirement forces us to x  = 2. this normalization of the coupling (4.26), which
diers by a factor 2 from the usual tree-level coupling (corresponding to  = 1), is required
also for a correct interpretation in terms of instanton contributions (see below). in the oppo-
site limit, t 1  0, the t 1-dependent contribution vanishes (up to an irrelevant logarithmic

15

term in 1/t 1). this is consistent with the identication of 1/t 1 with sas = 4sas, and
implies in particular that the type ii asymmetric orbifold is the strong coupling limit of the
heterotic:

1

shet

sas = 

.

(5.2)

in order to test the above duality relations, we consider the n = 2 phase of the various
theories under consideration, where the dependence on the other moduli, generating from
genus one for all three models, remains. the part of the gravitational amplitude that depends
on the perturbative moduli is indeed the same in the three models, provided we identify the
moduli (tas, uas) with (t 2, t 3) and (t, u). through the duality map, we therefore learn
that, similarly to the symmetric type iia orbifold, the heterotic model possesses an n = 8
supersymmetry that is broken spontaneously. this breaking on the heterotic side is non-
perturbative: the higgs eld whose vev is the order parameter for the spontaneous breaking
of the n = 8 supersymmetry to n = 4 is the dilaton shet, and the n = 8 supersymmetry
can be restored at the strong coupling limit. the further breaking of the supersymmetry
from n = 4 to n = 2 is realized spontaneously in a perturbative way, by using as higgs
elds the moduli t and u. the full, perturbative and non-perturbative, correction to the
eective coupling constant of the gravitational term considered here is given by the type iia
result, eq. (2.6). in heterotic string variables, we have:

(5.4)

from expression (5.3) we can easily read o the instanton numbers k, given by the powers
of q  exp 2ishet in the expansion of the rst term. we obtain k  n
2 , which for  = 2
becomes, as expected, k  n.

6 the prepotential

6.1 the one-loop result

the perturbative prepotential can be easily computed from the heterotic side. owing to
the n = 2 supersymmetry, it receives no perturbative corrections beyond one loop. the
tree-level contribution is determined by the geometric properties of the vector manifold, and
is the same for both the constructions based on  and on  [33]:

shett u .

h(0) = 

i
2

16

(6.1)

the genus-one correction, on the other hand, is dierent in the two constructions and,
moreover, it depends on the choice of shift vectors in the two-torus. here, we will concentrate
on the choices made previously for these shift vectors. the one-loop corrections to the
prepotential turn out to satisfy second-order dierential equations. these equations are
obtained by properly treating the universal part of the gauge corrections in models with
spontaneously broken supersymmetries, thereby generalizing the approach of [27, 30, 31].

notice that, in contrast to the universal corrections [24], the r.h.s. of the above equations
has singularities across lines in the moduli space.
integrals of this kind and analysis of
the singularities have been performed in several papers. we will not present the general
result here but give instead the answer for the prepotential. it is important to observe that
the above equations dene h(1) up to irrelevant linear and quadratic terms as well as cubic
terms such as t 2u or u 2t . these ambiguities can be resolved by looking at the ordinary

(6.4)

(6.5)

we would like to stress at this point that eqs. (6.2) and (6.4) (resp. (6.3) and (6.5)) hold
for heterotic constructions of the kind  (resp. ) with nv = nh 6= 0, as those presented in
[20]. therefore, our results for the perturbative prepotential h(1) or h(1) given below (eqs.
(6.6) and (6.7)) are valid for these more general models. this is again due to the fact that
the heterotic ground states under consideration fall into the same elliptic-genus universality
class, irrespectively of the value of nv = nh . non-perturbative contributions, however,
depend on the number of vector multiplets and hypermultiplets (through, for example, the
instanton numbers), and only the case nv = nh = 0 is analysed in the following.

17

after some lengthy algebra, we can solve the above equations and obtain the one-loop

prepotential for models based on the construction :

h(1)(t, u) = 

1

(2)4 (lc(t, u) + la(t, u) + lb(t, u)) 

=

for t2 < u2 .

(6.6)

the functions lc,a,b(t, u) are given in the appendix; lc,b(t, u) have a branch along t = u,
where b2|massless = nv  nh = 14. for models based on the construction , we
obtain:

h(1)(t, u) =

b (cid:18)t
, 2u(cid:19) + l(0)
b (t, u)(cid:19) ,

2

, u(cid:19)

(6.7)

where the functions l()
c,a,b(t, u) are as displayed in the appendix. in this case there is no
branch at t = u, where now b2|massless = 0, and (6.7) is thus valid for any t and u.
this makes the monodromy trivial around t = u. remember, however, that in the models
at hand, where the two-torus lattices are shifted, the target-space duality group is only a
subgroup of sl(2, z)t sl(2, z)u z t u
. in particular t  1/t is not a symmetry, and
the line t = u is not equivalent to the line 1/t = u. the latter, where b2|massless = 2,
is a branch for h(1)(t, u), although this is not straightforward from expression (6.7)  a
poisson resummation is needed. observe also the absence of cubic terms in h(1). such terms
are present in generic models with spontaneously broken supersymmetry, as those studied in
[24], for which the corrections to the prepotential can be computed in a similar way. cubic
terms vanish in general when the intersection form of the underlying calabiyau manifold of
the type ii dual becomes trivial7, as in our case. on the other hand, the absence of constant
term both in h(1) and h(1) reects the vanishing of the euler characteristic  = 2 (h1,1  h2,1).

6.2 non-perturbative contributions

let us now try to go beyond the above perturbative result. we will concentrate on the
construction based on , for which we have been able to determine the precise duality map.
for the prepotential, however, we have no exact type ii result that could be used to obtain
the heterotic non-perturbative contributions directly. nevertheless, the structure of the type
ii model is useful to infer at least part of these contributions.

the type ii (1, 1) ground state of section 2 is symmetric under permutations of the three
moduli {t 1, 1/t 2, t 3}. the heterotic dual should therefore possess the same property with
respect to {shet, 1/t, u}. in fact, invariance under 1/t  u is a residual target-space
7this implies that the heterotic construction based on , in which such cubic terms are present (see eq.
(6.6)), cannot be dual to a type ii, z2  z2 symmetric orbifold, for which the intersection matrix is trivial.

18

duality symmetry of the shifted lattices we are considering, and eq. (6.3) is indeed invariant
owing to the covariance property8 of the perturbative result h(1)(t, u) given in (6.7):

h(1)(cid:18)

1
u

, 

1

t(cid:19) =

1

t 2 u 2

h(1)(t, u)

(6.8)

(note, however, that h(1)(u, t ) 6= h(1)(t, u), owing to the breakdown of the t  u symme-
try).

in order to promote the above 1/t  u permutation symmetry to the level of the
three moduli, we must demand the following covariance properties for the full prepotential
h (shet, t, u):

h(cid:18)shet, 
h(cid:18)

 2
shet

shet

t 2

h (shet, t, u)

(6.9)

which are fullled by the tree-level contribution (6.1). we must therefore add two more
terms to h(1)(t, u):

h (shet, t, u) = h(0) + h(1)(t, u) + h(1) (t, shet) + t 2 u 2 h(1)(cid:18)

1
u

, shet(cid:19) .

(6.10)

these extra terms account for non-perturbative corrections and are exponentially suppressed
at large shet.

the above covariant symmetrization, which we have been advocating in order to deter-
mine non-perturbative corrections to the prepotential, does not exclude the possibility of
having also a series of exponentially suppressed terms with, in the arguments, covariant-
symmetric functions of shet, t and u, in the sense of (6.9). unfortunately, we have no
reason to rule out such non-perturbative contributions, nor a method for computing them
from the type ii symmetric or asymmetric ground states.

7 conclusions

in this work we studied n = 2 superstring ground states obtained from the heterotic and type
ii ten-dimensional superstrings through freely acting (asymmetric) orbifold compactication.
the massless spectrum of all these models is the same. besides the n = 2 supergravity
multiplet, there are three vector multiplets and four hypermultiplets. the construction
presented here extends the work of ref. [20], where we analysed heterotic/type ii duals with
n = 2 supersymmetries that have 3 + nv vector multiplets and 4 + nh hypermultiplets
with nv = nh 6= 0. here, we presented three dierent n = 2 models with nv = nh = 0

8the absence of pure power-like terms in (6.8) reects again the vanishing of the euler characteristic and

intersection form of the dual symmetric type ii construction.

19

and we veried the non-perturbative duality conjecture between them. the models we have
considered are the following: (i) the heterotic construction with n = (2, 0) supersymmetry,
based on characters  of the c = (0, 16) conformal block, eq. (4.8) (this choice is equivalent
to a particular choice of discrete wilson lines, reducing the number of the vectors to three
and that of the hypers to four); (ii) the type iia symmetric construction with n = (1, 1)
supersymmetry, which corresponds to a self-mirror calabiyau compactication with hodge
numbers h1,1 = h2,1 = 3; (iii) the type ii asymmetric n = (2, 0) freely acting orbifold
compactication, where the initial n = (4, 4) supersymmetry is spontaneously broken to
n = (2, 0).

the equivalence of the heterotic n = (2, 0), type iia n = (1, 1) and n = (2, 0) was
veried for the corrections of a modied gravitational and gauge combination associated
2
with the operator p
grav introduced in section 4. this operator has the property of being
regular in the entire (t, u) moduli space.

in the duality relations between the constructions described above, the heterotic vector
moduli (shet, t, u) are mapped to the three h1,1 moduli (t 1, t 2, t 3) of the symmetric type
ii, as well as to the moduli of the asymmetric type ii (sas, tas, uas), where sas = 1/sas is
the inverse of the asymmetric type ii dilaton. thus, there is a weakstrong coupling s-duality
relation between the heterotic and the asymmetric type ii ground state, shet = 1/sas. in
all above duals there is a (non-)perturbative restoration of n = 8 and n = 4 supersymmetry
in some specic limits of the three moduli, which is in agreement with the duality maps.

by using these duality maps, we found that the type ii corrections provide the complete,
perturbative and non-perturbative, heterotic corrections, as was also the case for all n = 2
models with nv = nh constructed in ref.
[20]. this remarkable property is due to the
universality of the n = 2 sector in the heterotic orbifold and of the corresponding n = (2, 2)
sectors in the symmetric and asymmetric type ii orbifolds. we obtained in this way the full
gravitational heterotic corrections. these contain instanton corrections, nk exp 2kishet,
which are due to the euclidean ve-brane wrapped around the six-dimensional internal
space; they depend only on shet and not on the other moduli. the explicit expressions
for these corrections are given in eq. (5.3). the olivemontonen duality group is a (2)
subgroup of sl(2, z)shet

.

finally, we computed the perturbative and part of the non-perturbative corrections to the
prepotential for the heterotic ground state. the perturbative result is actually valid beyond
the models presented in this paper, and covers more general situations, with nv = nh 6= 0
such as those of ref.
[20]. the non-perturbative piece was reached by using the triality
symmetry between the three moduli of the type ii symmetric model t 1  1/t 2  t 3.
the requirement of (partial) restoration of the (n = 4) n = 8 supersymmetry in special
limits of the vector moduli turned to be too weak to rule out or determine extra potential
non-perturbative terms in the prepotential.
