we explain sklyanins separation of variables in geometrical terms and construct it

for hitchin and mukai integrable systems. we construct hilbert schemes of points on
t  for  = c, c or elliptic curve in some detail and show that their complex defor-

mations are integrable systems of calogero-sutherland type. we present the hyperkahler

quotient constructions for hilbert schemes of points on cotangent bundles to the higher

genus curves, utilizing the results of hurtubise, kronheimer and nakajima. finally we

discuss the connections to physics of d-branes and string duality.

1. introduction

one way of solving a complicated problem with many degrees of freedom is to reduce

it to the problem with smaller number degrees of freedom. the solvable models allow

to reduce the original system with n degrees of freedom to n systems with 1 degree

of freedom which can be solved in quadratures. this approach is called a separation of

variables (sov). recently, e. sklyanin came up with a magic recipe for the sov in the

large class of integrable models with a lax representation [1][2]. the basic strategy of his

method is to look at the lax eigen-vector (also called baker-akhiezer function) (z, ):

l(z)(z, ) = (z)(z, )

(1.1)

with some choice of normalization (this is the artistic part of the method). the poles

zi of (z, ) together with the eigenvalues i = (zi) are the separated variables. in all

the examples studied so far the most naive way of normalization leads to the canonically

conjugate coordinates i, zi.

the purpose of this paper is to explain the geometry behind the magic recipe in

a broad class of examples, which include hitchin systems [3], their deformations [4] and

many-body systems considered as their degenerations [5][6]. we shall use the results of
[7],[8],[9]. for a complex surface x let x [h] denote the hilbert scheme of points on x of
length h (if x is compact hyperkahler then so is x [h] [10]).

2. hitchin systems

hitchin systems can be thought of as a generalized many-body system. in fact, elliptic

calogero-moser model as well as its various spin and some relativistic generalizations can

be thought as of a particular degeneration of hitchin system [5],[11],[6].

2.1. the integrable system

recall the general hitchins setup [3]. one starts with the compact algebraic curve  of

genus higher then one and a topologically trivial vector bundle v over it. let g = sln (c),

g = lieg. the hitchin system is the integrable system on the moduli space n of stable

higgs bundles. the point of n is the gauge equivalence class of a pair ( an operator
a =  + a, a holomorphic section  of ad(v )  1

). the holomorphic structure on v is

1

dened with the help of a. the symplectic structure on n descends from the two-form

r tr   a. the integrals of motion are the hitchins hamiltonians:

trk  h0(, k)  c(2k1)(g1),

k > 1

their total number is equal to:

n1xk=2

(2k  1)(g  1) = (n 2  1)(g  1) = 1

2 dimcn

thus, n can be represented as bration over

b =

n1mk=2

h0(, k)

with the bre over a generic point b  b being an abelian variety eb. this variety is

identied by hitchin with the quotient of the jacobian variety jb of the spectral curve cb,

dened as the divisor of zeroes of

r(z, ) = det((z)  )  h0(, n )

in t . the curve cb has genus n 2(g  1) + 1 which is by g higher then the dimension
of eb. in fact, eb = jb/jac(). the jacobian of  is imbedded into the jacobian of c

since the spectral curve is a covers  and therefore the holomorphic 1-dierentials on 
are pulled back to cb. an open dense subset of n is isomorphic to t m, the cotangent
bundle to the moduli space of holomorphic stable g-bundles on .

the space n is a non-compact integrable system. one can compactify it by replacing
t  by a k3 surface. this is a natural deformation of the original system in the sense
that the innitesimal neibourghood of  imbedded into k3 is isomorphic to t  (since

c1(k3) = 0). instead of studying the moduli space of the gauge elds on  together with

the higgs elds  one studies the moduli of torsion free sheaves, supported on  [4].

it turns out that this model is important in the studies of the bound states of d2

branes in type iia string theory compactied on k3, which wrap a given holomorphic

curve . one can think of the bound state as of the vacuum in the gauge theory on 

according to [12], [13]. it can also be represented classically by a smooth curve of the genus
h = n 2(g  1) + 1, which is an n -fold cover of .

2

in the compactied case, the curve c (which is nothing but our fellow spectral curve

cb) is imbedded into k3. it is also endowed with the line bundle l (from the point of view

of hitchin equations the bundle is simply the eigen-bundle of ; from the d-brane point

of view - the single d-brane carries a u (1) gauge eld on it and the vacuum conguration

corresponds to a at connection) which determines a point on its jacobian jb.

take the generic section of this line bundle. it has h zeroes p1, . . . , ph. conversely,

given a set s of h points in k3 there is generically a unique curve c in a given homology

class   h2(k3, z) of genus h with a line bundle on it l, such that the curve passes
through these points and the divisor of l coincides with s.

this allows one to identify the open dense subset of the moduli space of pairs (a curve
cb; a line bundle l on it) with that in the symmetric power symh(k3) of the k3 surface
itself. the symplectic form on the moduli space is therefore the direct sum of h copies of

the symplectic forms on k3.

summarizing, the phase space of integrable system looks locally as t m, where m is

the moduli space of rank n vector bundles over , where  is holomorphically imbedded in

k3. it can also be identied with the moduli space of pairs ( a curve cb; a line bundle l on

it) where the homology class of cb is n times that of , and the topology l is xed. this

identication provides the action-angle coordinates on the phase space. namely, the angle

coordinates are (following [3]) the linear coordinates on the jacobian of cb, while the action
coordinates are the periods of d1 along the a-cycles on cb. the last identication of the
phase space with the symmetric power of k3 provides the sov in the sense of sklyanin.

notice the similarity of our description to his magic recipe.

2.2. separation of variables in hitchin system

let us present an explicit realization of the separation of variables in the hitchin

system. let  be a compact smooth genus g algebraic curve and p be the projection
p : t   . let v be complex vector bundle over  of rank n and degree k. consider

the moduli space mn,k of the semi-stable holomorphic structures e on v .
it can be
identied with the quotient of the open subset of the space of a operators acting on the
sections of v by the action of the gauge group a  g1 ag. the complex dimension of
mn,k is given by the riemann-roch formula

dimcmn,k = n 2(g  1) + 1 := h

(2.1)

3

explicitly, the points in t mn,k are the equivalence classes of pairs (e, ) where e is the
holomorphic bundle on  and  is the section of end(e)  . the map  is given by the
formula:

(e, ) = {tr, tr2, . . . , trn }

(2.2)

let h denote the h-dimensional vector space ch:

h = n

l=1h0(l
 )

n. hitchin shows that the partial compactication of the cotangent bundle t mn,k is the
algebraiccaly integrable system, i.e. there exists a holomorphic map

 : t mn,k  h

whose bers are abelian varieties which are lagrangian with respect to the canonical
symplectic structure on t mn,k. the generic ber is compact. geometric separation of
variables in hitchin system is the content of the following:

theorem. there exists a birational map

 : t mn,k  (t )[h],

which is a symplectomorphism of the open dense subsets.
remark. the open dense set in x [h] coincides with (x h  )/sh where  denotes the
union of all diagonals and sh is the symmetric group. the theorem implies that on this
dense set one can introduce the coordinates {(zi, i)}, where zi  , i  t 
zi , such that
the symplectic form in these coordinates have the separated form:

 =

hxi=1

i  zi

(2.3)

the coordinates (i, zi) are dened up to permutations.

proof. first we construct  and prove that this map is biholomorphic. in order to do

that we need t o choose special k. as the moduli spaces mn,k are isomorphic for dierent
k (although not canonically!) this is not a problem. fix the pair (e, ). consider the
spectral curve c  t  dened as the zero set of the characteristic polynomial

p (, z) = det((z)  )  (n
 )

(2.4)

4

its genus equals h as can be seen from the adjunction formula or from riemann-hurwitz
formula. the pullback pe restricted to c contains the line sub-bundle l of the eigen-lines
of . our choice of k is such that the degree of l equals h. generically l has unique up

to a multiple non-vanishing section s. its zeroes l1, . . . , lh determine h points on c and
therefore on t . clearly they are determined uniquely up to permutations. this allows
us to dene:

(e, ) = (l1, . . . , lh)

(2.5)

now let us prove that the image of  coincides with (t )[h]. we do it at the level of the
open dense sets. fix the set of points (l1 = (1, z1), . . . , lh = (h, zh)) in t . let (j)
denote a basis in the space of holomorphic j-dierentials on . for given j the index 



runs from 1 to (2j  1)(g  1) for j  2, to g for j = 1 and to 1 for j = 0. consider the
space v of sections of pn

 . the vectors of v are:

p (, z) =

nxj=0x

vj,(j)

 (z)nj

(2.6)

the dimension of v equals h + 1. consider the subspace of p s such that p (i, zi) = 0
in that
for any i = 1, . . . , h.

it is one-dimensional if the points l1, . . . , lh are distinct.

case choose any p in this one dimensional subspace and consider the curve c dened by

the equation p (, z) = 0 through the points l1, . . . , lh. they form a divisor of the unique
line bundle l on c of degree h which can be considered as a point of (t )[h]. then
we can consider a direct image pl which is a vector bundle over  and a higgs form
 : pl  pl   which is nothing but the multiplication by the elements   c. hence
we obtain desired one-to-one correspondence at least at the level of an open dense sets.

now let us prove the equality of symplectic forms on t mn,k and on (t )[h].
we show it at the generic point of (t )[h] corresponding to the set of distinct points
(l1, . . . , lh). to this end recall the construction of the symplectic form on t mn,k in
terms of the data (c, l): let aa be a choice of the basis of a-cycles on c. the jacobian
jac(c) = h(0,1)(c, c)/h1(c, z) has the local linear coordinates b associated to aa. they
are normalized in such a way that:

zaa

db = a
b

where db is represented as a (1, 0)-form on c. introduce the coordinates i a:

i a =zaa

dz.

of holomorphic 1-dierentials on c which obeys:

using (2.10) we get:

remark. j. hurtubise in [7] gave the pure algebro-geometric proof of the main part of

the theorem. the basic motivation of our remarks is that some of our arguments looks

more direct and more in the spirit of the approach of integrable systems.

3. gaudin model

consider the space

(o1  . . .  ok) //g

(3.1)

where ol are the complex coadjoint orbits of g = sln (c) and the symplectic quotient is

taken with respect to the diagonal action of g.

this moduli space parameterizes higgs pairs on p1 with singularities at the marked

points zi  p1,
i = 1, . . . , k. this is a natural analogue of the hitchin space for genus
zero. concretely, the connection to the bundles on p1 comes about as follows: consider the
moduli space of higgs pairs: ( a, ) where  is a meromorphic section of ad(v )  o(2),
with the restriction that resz=zi   oi. the moduli space is isomorphic to (3.1). this
space is integrable system, studied in [14][15]. indeed, consider the solution to the equation

a =xi

i (2)(z  zi)
c

(3.2)

in the gauge where a = 0 (such gauge exists for stable bundles on p1 due to grothendiecks
theorem). we get:

provided that pi c

i = 0 and is dened up to a global conjugation by an element of g

hence the hamiltonian reduction in (3.1). now, consider the following polynomial:

det (  (z)) =xi,l

ai,lizl

(3.4)

it is an easy count to check that the number of functionally independent coecients ai,l

is precisely equal to

k(cid:18) n (n  1)

2

(cid:19) + 1  n 2

now let us treat explicitly the case n = 2. in this case the coadjoint orbits oi can be
explicitly described as the surfaces in c3 given by the equations:

oi : z2

and the complex moment maps:

i zi(cid:19)
i =(cid:18) zi x +

(3.7)

the phase space of our interest is p = k
somewhat larger space p0 = k

i=1oi/c, where c  sl2(c) acts as follows:

the moment map of the torus c action is simplypi zi. the complex dimension of p0 is

equal to 2(k  1). the hamiltonians are obtained by expanding the quadratic invariant:

that the restriction of the symplectic form p i onto the set pi zi = 0 is the pullback of

(3.12)

in the last section we present the quantum analogue of this separation of variables.

4. many-body systems: rational and trigonometric cases

in this section we study the hilbert scheme of points on s = c2, s = c2/ for

  zn , z. we show that s[v] has a complex deformation s[v]
integrable model including the complexication of sutherland model [16].



and that each s[v]

is an



4.1. points on c  c

let us start with c2. as is well-known [17] the hilbert scheme of points on c2 has
it is the set of stable triples (b1, b2, i), i  v  cv, b1, b2 
adhm-like description:
end(v ), [b1, b2] = 0 modulo the action of gl(v ): (b1, b2, i)  (gb1g1, gb2g1, gi) for
g  gl(v ). stability means that by acting on the vector i by arbitrary polynomials in

b1, b2 one can generate the whole of v .

the meaning of the vector i and the operators b1, b2 is the following. let z1, z2
be the coordinates on c2. let z be a zero-dimensional subscheme of c2 of length v. it
means that the space h0(oz) of functions on z which are the restrictions of holomorphic
functions on c2 has dimension v. let v be this space of functions. then it has the

canonical vector i which is the constant function f = 1 restricted to z and the natural

action of two commuting operators: multiplication by z1 and by z2, which are represented
by the operators b1 and b2. conversely, given a stable triple (b1, b2, i) the scheme z,
or, rather the corresponding ideal iz  c[z1, z2] is reconstructed as follows: f  iz i
f (b1, b2)i = 0.

now let us discuss the notion of stability. in the geometric invariants theory (git)

the notion of a stable triple (b1, b2, i) would be the following: there exists a holomorphic
function  on the space of all triples ( b1, b2, i) such that:

1. for any g  gl(v ),

(g b1g1, g b2g1, g i) = det(g)( b1, b2, i)

2. (b1, b2, i) 6= 0.

9

let us show the equivalence of the two denitions of stability. choose any v-tuple ~f
of polynomials f1, . . . , fv  c[z1, z2]. choose any non-zero element   (vcv). dene
a function

 ~f ( b1, b2, i) = (cid:16)f1( b1, b2) i  . . .  fv( b1, b2) i(cid:17)

(4.1)

clearly it obeys the property 1. if the triple (b1, b2, i) is stable in the sense of the rst
denition then there exist a v-tuple ~f for which the vectors f1(b1, b2)i, . . . , fv(b1, b2)i
form a basis in cv and therefore  ~f (b1, b2, i) 6= 0. conversely, if  ~f (b1, b2, i) = 0 for
any ~f then the span s of {c[b1, b2]i} is strictly less then v . on the other hand s is an
invariant subspace.

now let us discuss another aspect of the space (cid:0)c2(cid:1)[v]

see this let us start with the space of quadruples, (b1, b2, i, j) with b1, b2, i as above
and j  v . it is a symplectic manifold with the symplectic form

. it is symplectic manifold. to

 = tr [b1  b2 + i  j]

(4.2)

which is invariant under the naive action of g = gl(v ). the moment map for this action

is

 = [b1, b2] + ij  lieg.

(4.3)

let us perform the hamiltonian reduction, that is:

take the zero level set of , choose a subset of stable points in the sense of git and take

the quotient of this subset with respect to g. one can show [17] that the stability implies

that j = 0 and therefore the moment equation reduces to the familiar [b1, b2] = 0.

is an integrable system.

indeed, the functions trbl

moreover, (cid:0)c2(cid:1)[v]
it turns out that (cid:0)c2(cid:1)[v]

commute and are functionally independent for l = 1, . . . , v.

has an interesting complex deformation which preserves its
symplecticity and integrability. namely, instead of 1(0) in the reduction one should take
1(  id) for some   c. now j 6= 0. the resulting quotient s[v]
 no longer parametrizes
subschemes in c2 but rather sheaves on a non-commutative c2, that is the space where

functions are polynomials in z1, z2 with the commutation relation [z1, z2] =  (see [18]

for more details). nevertheless, the quotient itself is a perfectly well-dened symplectic
manifold with an integrable system on it: the functions hl = trbl
and are functionally independent for l = 1, . . . , v. on the dense open subset of s[v]

 where

b2 can be diagonalized: b2 = diag (q1, . . . , qv) the hamiltonians h1, h2 can be written as
follows:

h1 =xi

pi, h2 =xi

p2

i +xi<j

 2

(qi  qj )2

(4.4)

where pi = (b1)ii. these hamiltonians describe a collection of indistinguishable particles
on a (complex) line with a pair-wise potential interaction 1
x2 . this system is called rational
calogero model [19]. it is shown in [9] that the space s[v]
can be used for compactifying
the calogero ows in the complex case and moreover that the same compactication is



natural in the kdv/kp realization of calogero ows [20][21].

4.2. rounding o to c  c and to c  c

now let z1, z2 be the coordinates on c  c, i.e. z2 6= 0. then the description of the
previous section is still valid except that b2 must be invertible now. so in this case the
hilbert scheme of points is obtained by a complex hamiltonian reduction from the space
t  (g  v ). we skip all the details as they are well-known by now (the complex analogue

of the real reduction studied in [22][23] can be found for example in [5] ). the moment

map in our notations will be:

 = b1

2 b1b2  b1 + ij

which corresponds to the symplectic form:

 = tr(cid:2)b1b1

2 b2 + ij(cid:3)

(4.5)

(4.6)

the reduction at the non-zero level  =   id leads to the the complex analogue of either
sutherland [16] or rational ruijsenaars model [24][25]. in the former case h2 = trb2
1 while

b2 = diag (exp(2iq1), . . . , exp(2iqv)) the hamiltonian h2 equals:

2 (cid:1). on the open dense subset where b2 diagonalizable:

in the latter hrel = tr(cid:0)b2 + b1
h2 =xi

p2

i +xi<j

 2

sin2 (qi  qj )

(4.7)

the expression for hrel can be found in [5].

finally, if both b1 and b2 are invertible then we get the hilbert scheme of points on
c  c. its complex deformation is a bit more tricky, though. it turns out that it can
be obtained via poisson reduction of g  g  v  v . the integrable system one gets in

this case is the trigonometric case of ruijsenaars model [26].

4.3. ale models

slightly generalizing the results of [27][28][29] one may easily present the nite-
dimensional symplectic quotient construction of the hilbert scheme of points on t p1.
here it is: take v = cv, a = t hom(v, v), a = a  a and x = a  t (hom(v, c)).
the space x is acted on by the group g = gl(v )  gl(v ). the maximal compact

subgroup u of g preserves the hyperkahler structure of x. the hyperkahler quotient of x
with respect to u is the hilbert scheme of points on t p1 of length v.

this space is an integrable system. we shall prove it in a slightly more general setting.

 as well). the functional independence is easily checked on

5. elliptic models

5.1. hilbert scheme of points on t e

let e be the ellipic curve, e  jac(e) = pic0(e). for t  e let lt denote the
corresponding line bundle. in particular, let 0  e be the trivial line bundle: l0 = o. let
s = t e, let (z1, z2) be the coordinates on the universal cover of s, z2  t ,  : s  e
be the projection.

let z  s[v]. for each t  e let vt be the space h0 (z, lt|z). the spaces vt form
a holomorphic rank v bundle e over e. let  : v  v  1
e be the operator which
multiplies a section of lt by a covector (thus we get a map from v  1
e to v which is
the same as v  v  1
e ). the ber at t = 0 contains a distinguished vector i which is
the image of 1  h0(z, o|z). the triple (e, , i) is stable in the following sense: there
exists no holomorphic subbundle f of e , such that (f )  f  1

e and i  f0.

this is an appropriate counterpart of the notion of a stable higgs pair [30] in the case of

genus one.

let z  s[v]. consider the cover p : c  c  t e. let us lift z to the covering
space. the space v of functions on pz is z  z-module. by fourier transform we may

view this space as a space of functions on a two-torus with values in a v-dimensional vector
space. let t, t be the coordinates on the torus. the elements of the v-dimensional space
vt,t are the functions on pz which transform as follows:

f (z1 + m + n, z2) = exp

2i
  

(m (t  t) + n ( t   t)) f (z1, z2).

(5.1)

13

clearly, the function f  1 belongs to v0,0. it is represented by the vector i  v0,0.

to reconstruct a scheme z given a stable triple (,  + a, i) one can go to a gauge
where both  and a are constant (t-independent). then the matrices (, a) commute and
together with i form a stable triple suitable for dening a subscheme of c2 of length v. in
fact, the gauge where  and a are constant allows extra gauge transformations which make
the support of the subscheme of c2 invariant under the action of z  z by translations.
the simplest yet instructive case is that of the diagonalizable , a.
one can do more. the hilbert scheme of points on t e can be endowed with a hyperkahler
structure. to see this we start with the space x of the pairs (a, ) - where a is u (n ) gauge
eld on the torus e and  is the adjoint-valued one-form. the space x is hyperkahler and

the hyperkahler structure is preserved by the action of the gauge group g. the latter may
also act via evaluation at some points t1, . . . , ts on some nite-dimensional hyperkahler
manifolds o1, . . . , os. let ~k be the hyperkahler moment map for ok. let us consider the
hyperkahler reduction of the space x  o1  . . . os with respect to g. we rst impose the
hyperkahler moment map equations:

t + [at, t] =

ftt + [t, t] =

sxk=1
sxk=1

k(2)(t  tk)
c

k(2)(t  tk)
r

(5.2)

these equations are the genus one analogues of hitchins self-duality equations [30]. they

were studied from the point of view of complex reduction in [5][31][32]. they also appeared

in the study of intersecting d-branes on tori [33](see also [34] for the general discussion of
d-branes on tori). the case of our interest here is s = 1, o1 = t cpn1. the complex
reduction in this case has been studied in [31] where it was shown that the solutions to the

equations (5.2) (in fact of their deformation) form a holomorphic integrable system, which

turns out to be elliptic calogero-moser system. the latter describes the system of non-
relativistic particles on elliptic curve e, which pairwise interact via potential  2
c (zi  zj)
where  is a the period of a holomorphic symplectic form on o1 (see below).

the space o1 in turn can be described as a hyperkahler quotient of c2n with respect
to the action of u (1) which has charges (+1, 1) on cn  cn . let us denote the elements
of cn  cn as i  j, where j and i are the row and the column vectors respectively.
then the equations (5.2) can be written explicitly as:

z + [az, z] = (ij  cid) (2)(z)

fz z + [z, z] =(cid:0)ii   j j  rid(cid:1) (2)(z)

14

(5.3)

the solutions to (5.3) are the gauge elds which have monodromy around the puncture

z = 0, which is conjugate to exp(cid:0)ii   j j  rid(cid:1) and the covariantly constant higgs

elds which have a rst order pole at z = 0 with the residue given by (ij  cid).

6. beauville - mukais systems

let s be the surface of k3 type, which contains a holomorphically embedded curve

 of genus g. fix the numbers n and p. let mn,p,g(s, ) be the moduli space of the
pairs (c, l), where [c] = n [], c is a holomorphically embedded curve and l is the line

bundle on c of degree p. let h be the genus of generic c. it is equal to

h = 1 + n 2(g  1)

(6.1)

let m be the compactication of mn,h,g(s, ) (the case of general p is left beyond the
scope of our investigation) which is dened as the moduli space of pairs (c, l) where c is

a curve as above and l is a torsion free rank one coherent sheaf on c (if the curve c is

smooth then this is the same as a line bundle), with rc c1(l) = h.

theorem. m is a symplectic manifold, birationally equivalent to s[h] with its standard

symplectic structure.

proof. the statement is actually well-known and is a compilation of two beauville remarks

[35], [36]. similar considerations are contained in [37],[38]. fix a smooth irreducible

representative c. a. beauville proves that under the conditions of our theorem there
exists a morphism  : s  ph, such that its restriction to c coincides with the canonical
embedding of c into ph1 by the sections of the canonical sheaf c of c: a hyperplane
h  ph intersects (s) by a curve ch. a restriction of the line bundle o(1) over ph to
ch gives a line bundle lh of degree h.

given a very ample line bundle l over ch of the same degree h one may consider
as a base of the bration j  |l| with the

the corresponding linear system |l| =(cid:0)ph(cid:1)

ber jac(ch ) [35] over a point ch. moreover, as it was shown in [39] one can extend this
bration to a compactied bration j with the bre jac(ch) such that dim j = 2h.
this space is an algebraically completely integrable system with respect to a holomorphic

symplectic structure introduced in [40]. through h lineary independent points p1, . . . , ph
in s  ph the unique hyperplane h passes. hence (generically) there exists a unique genus

h curve ch passing through the points and the line bundle l whose divisor coincides with
p1 + . . . + ph. this l has a unique up to a constant non-zero section with h zeroes at the

15

points p1, . . . , ph. in other words the pairs (c, l)  m are parameterized by j . we have
established a correspondence between the point of m and the point of smooth open subset
in symmetric product symh(s). proposition 1.3 of [36] shows that this correspondence
actually extends to a birational isomorphism of our theorem. thus the symplectic structure
of mukais on j maps to a direct sum of symplectic structures on the copies of the surface
s.

remark. the identication of beauville-mukai integrable systems phase space with the

hilbert scheme of points on the initial k3 surface s provides an analogue of sklyanins
sov in terms of projective coordinates in ph. it again resembles his magic recipe: the
role of zeroes and poles of eigen-bundle sections is played by the zeroes of sections of linear
bundles l arising under replacing of t  by k3 surface s.

the following example of beauville-mukai system which is proposed in [35] is an

illustration of this ad hoc separation.
example. let us consider a quartic s  p3 given by the equation f (x0, x1, x2, x3) = 0
in homogeneous coordinates (x0 : x1 : x2 : x3). this is an example of k3 surface. the
condition degf = 4 implies that s has a holomorphic symplectic form, whose associated
poisson bracket can be described quite explicitly. suppose x0 = t 6= 0. let f (x1, x2, x3) =
t4f (t, tx1, tx2, tx3). let g, h be the locally dened holomorphic functions on s\s {x0 =
0}. extend them to the functions in (x1, x2, x3) dened in the neibourghood of f 1(0).
then:

{g, h} 

(6.2)

dg  dh  df

dx1  dx2  dx3

evaluated at f = 0 is well-dened independently of the choices made and also the poisson

bivector dened in this way extends to the whole of s. now we want to study the h = 3d
symmetric power of s, more precisely the hilbert scheme s[3].
xai, i = 1, . . . , 3,  = 0, 1, 2, 3. we denote by ~xi = (x1i, x2i, x3i), where xai = xai/x0i,
a = 1, 2, 3. the space s[3] has a natural sympectic form h which is the induced from
the symplectic form on s via the hilbert-chow morphism s[3]  sym3(s). let  = 1
h
be the corresponding poisson bivector. we now dene three functions on s[3]. assume
rst that ~xi 6= ~xj, i 6= j. then the construction of the previous section can be formulated
very concretely as follows. there is a unique hyperplane in p3 which passes through the
points ~x1, ~x2, ~x3  s  p3. the space of hyperplanes in p3 is the dual projective space

introduce the variables

h =(cid:0)p3(cid:1)

:

c = (c0 : c1 : c2 : c3)  h 7

3xa=0

caxa = 0, x = (x0 : x1 : x2 : x3)  p3

(6.3)

16

the hilbert scheme of points contains regions where the points coincide. for a collision
of a pair of points ~x1, ~x2 one glues a line p1 which determines the direction along which
the points collided. in this case there still exists a unique hyperplane in p3 which passes

through this line and the third point ~x3. now, if the third point approaches the cluster
formed by the rst two then the plane p2 along which the conguration of the line and
the third point collided is contained in the hilbert scheme of points. thus we have shown

that by associating a plane to the triple of points and they limits one gets a well-dened

birational map:

 : s[3]  h

the map  is given by the explicit formulae:

 = det

(6.4)

(6.5)

where  is the 3  3 matrix obtained from kxaik by removing the th column. in the
domain where 0 := detkxaik  0/ (x10x20x30) 6= 0 we may introduce the functions:

where a = detma, (ma)bi = xbi, for b 6= a and (ma)ai = 1 for any i:

ha =

(6.7)

these explicit hamiltonians are dened in 1(a3), where a3 is the ane part of h,
corresponding to 0 6= 0. it follows from the identity:

{a, b} = a{0, b}  b{0, a}

(6.8)

that the hamiltonians ha, a = 1, 2, 3, poisson commute. it would be interesting to in-

vestigate this system as an example of a deformation of a hitchin system in the sense

of [4] and to study its quantum analogues which as are hopefully related to some feigin -

odesski - sklyanin algebras.

7. relations to the physics of d-branes and gauge theories

the abovementioned constructions of the separation of variables in integrable systems

on moduli spaces of holomorphic bundles with some additional structures can be described

as a symplectomorphism between the moduli spaces of the bundles (more precisely, torsion

free sheaves) having dierent topology, e.g. chern classes.

to be specic let us concentrate on the moduli space m~v of stable torsion free coherent
sheaves e on s. let as = 1  [pt]  h (s, z) be the a-roof genus of s. the vector

~v = ch(e)p as = (r; ~w; d  r)  h(s, z), ~w  3,19 corresponds to the sheaves with the

chern numbers:

ch0(e) = r  h0(s; z)
ch1(e) = ~w  h2(s; z)

ch2(e) = d  h4(s; z)

(7.1)

type iia string theory compactied on s has bps states, corresponding to the dp-branes,
with p even, wrapping various supersymmetric cycles in s, labelled by ~v  h(s, z).

the actual states correspond to the cohomology classes of the moduli spaces m~v of the
congurations of branes. the latter can be identied with the moduli spaces m~v of

appropriate sheaves.

the string theory, compactied on s has moduli space of vacua, which can be identied

with

imia = o(cid:0)4,20(cid:1) \o(4, 20; r)/o(4; r)  o(20; r)

where the arithmetic group o(4,20) is the group of discrete authomorphismes. it maps
the states corresponding to dierent ~v to each other. the only invariant of its action is ~v2.

we have studied three realizations of an integrable system.

the rst one uses the non-abelian gauge elds on the curve  imbedded into symplectic

surface s. namely, the phase space of the system is the moduli space of stable pairs: (e, ),

where e is rank r vector bundle over  of degree l, while  is the holomorphic section of
1

  end(e).

the second realization is the moduli space of pairs (c, l), where c is the curve

(divisor) in s which realizes the homology class r[] and l is the line bundle on c.

the third realization is the hilbert scheme of points on s of length h, where h =

1
2 dimm.

the equivalence of the rst and the second realizations corresponds to the physical

statement that the bound states of n d2-branes wrapped around  are represented by

18

a single d2-brane which wraps a holomorphic curve c which is an n -sheeted covering of

the base curve . the equivalence of the second and the third descriptions is tempting to

attribute to t -duality.

8. discussion

we have attempted to formulate the separation of variables purely in geometric terms.

it seems that the proper physical setup is the use of chain of dualities to get the system of

d0 branes on some hyperkahler manifold.

a few subjects need further clarication. evidently an interesting question to inves-

tigate is the quantization of the integrable system. according to drinfeld, the quantum

separation of variables can be viewed as the geometrical langlands transform which maps

the spectrum of the hitchin d-module (hamiltonians) to the data connected to the local

system on the dual object. what we have studied is the classical analogue of the lang-

lands correspondence which maps the phase space of the hitchin and mukai systems to

the hilbert scheme of points.

the quantum separation of variables goes as follows. the wave function in the

separated variables becomes the product of identical factors up to a determinant factor

qi,j(i  j):

(1, . . . , n) =yi

q(i)

where q() obeys the so-called baxters equation

det (l()  ) q() = 0

where l() is the lax operator of the dynamical system, evaluated at the zero of the

baker-akhiezer function. the variable  is viewed as an operator acting on q(). the

commutation relation between  and  implies the representation of , which can be either

dierential, dierence or integral operator.

in some sense q(i) can be considered as the wave function of a single d0 brane while

the union of integrable systems with all n s is the second quantization.

as an example of the quantum separation of variables let us consider the gaudin

system. consider d-modules which describe a system of dierential equations on the

moduli space mg() of principal g-bundles over a complex curve  with marked points

which is given by a commuting set of dierential operators whose symbols coincide with

19

(cid:18) hi
ei hi(cid:19)

fi

nxi=1
d(z) =
hi =xi6=j

z  zi

cij

zi  zj

,

(8.2)

(8.3)

hitchin hamiltonians. hence they can be considered as a quantization of hitchin systems

[41].

if the curve  has genus zero then the corresponding d-modules give rise to the

gaudin model of integrable quantum spin chain [42].

consider the punctured sphere  = cp1 and attach to each of the distinct marked
points zi, i = 1, ...n the g = sl2 verma module vi of the highest weight i  c. represent
the lie algebra sl2 by the basic dierential operators

ei = ti2

ti  iti ,

hi = 2titi  i,

fi = ti,

(8.1)

and denote by cij the casimir operator cij = eifj + fiej + 1
is given by

2 hihj . the lax operator d(z)

introduce the operators hi :

and i = ( + 2)zi  hi, where   c is a level. consider the innite-dimensional lie
: g = g  c((z))  ck, where c((z)) are meromorphic functions of a
algebras g and g

+

formal parameter z around a marked point and g

= g  c[[z]] is the lie subalgebra of g

+

which consists of the power seria in z. the quotient u g/(k  ) is denoted by ug. by

denition the conformal blocks are linear functionals:

f : n

i=1(u(g) u(g

) vi )  c,

+

(8.4)

which are invariant under the action of the lie algebra gout(z1, ..., zn) of the laurent seria
at the marked points of regular g-valued functions on the marked sphere which vanish

at innity.

it is well-known fact [42] that any such functional denes a number-valued

function f (z1, . . . , zn; t1, . . . , tn) obeying the knizhnik-zamolodchikov system

i(f ) = 0.

(8.5)

let us perform the transition to the separated variables pi: (z, t1, . . . , tn)  (z, p1, . . . , pn1, u),
where the variables (p, u) and t are dened through the following relation:

nxi=1

ti

z  zi

dz = uqn1
qn

l=1 (z  pl)
i=1(z  zi)

dz.

20

(8.6)

it is clear that pl which are the zeroes of the 12 element of the lax matrix are zeroes of
the baker-akhiezer function. therefore the spectral curve

yields baxter-sklyanin equation for the gaudin magnet

2 = det(z)

(cid:2)2
pi + det(pi)(cid:3) q(pi) = 0,

, which denes a projective connection. if one considers g = sln

i

pzi

where  = p pi

magnet instead then baxter equation becomes the n -th order dierential equation.

in generic situation there are a few subtle points. first, the proper ordering should

be chosen in the quantum operators. secondly, when discussing hitchin system on higher

genus curve one has to deal with globally dened objects with proper modular properties.

there are no global solutions to the dierential equations in this case. the dierential

operators are dened globally, though.

the explicit computations in the case of genus 1 [6][5] give a system which interpolates

between the gaudin model and calogero-moser elliptic many-body system. drinfeld ap-

proach to sov for this system is elaborated in [43]. more detailed survey of this approach

can be found in [44].

it would be also interesting to formulate in the geometrical terms the generating

function for the separation of variables. it seems that this generating function has some

interesting properties.
