abstract

we present a technique to construct, for dm unitary minimal models, the non-

chiral fusion rules which determines the operator content of the operator product

algebra. using these rules we solve the bootstrap equations and therefore determine

the structure constants of these models. through this approach we emphasize the

role played by some discrete symmetries in the classication of minimal models.

1 introduction

the rst and the most known process to deal with the classication problem of two

dimensional conformal eld theories (cft) is the bootstrap approach. this approach

initially developed in the seminal work of belavin, polyakov and zamolodchikov (pbz)

[1] is based, among other things, on the associativity property of the operator product al-

gebra (opa) of the four point correlation functions on the plane. formally speaking, this

property known as crossing symmetry is expressed by the so-called bootstrap equations.

these equations are the master equations since their resolution gives in principle a com-

plete classication of a conformal theory. (pbz) mentioned the existence of a particular

class of (cft) associated to degenerate representation of the virasoro algebra for which

the bootstrap equations can be solved. this class of cfts designed as minimal models

include the nite discrete unitary models with central charge c < 1 [2].

in this framework, dotsenko and fattev (df) [3] proposed to solve the bootstrap equa-

tions and therefore they determined the structure constants of the operator algebra for

correlations with spinless elds. they use in their construction the monodromy property

of conformal blocs dening the coordinate dependencies of the correlation functions in

the halomorphic (antihalomorphic) sector z (z) in the coulomb gas formalism. indeed for

spineless elds the conformal blocs in the two sectors are complex conjugate so that only

diagonal combinations of this blocs survive to the monodromy constraint. after this work

capelli, itzykson and zuber [4] made a complete classication of modular invariant par-

tition functions: the ade classication of minimal conformal models. their results gave

the operator content of all the minimal models. the (a) present only spinless primary

elds and the models of this series are those studied by (df).

nevertheless, in the case of the (d) series solving the bootstrap equations seems to be

more dicult. two diculties arise; namely the presence of spin elds and the existence

of two copies of certain elds. because of the presence of the non-vanishing spin elds, it is

dicult to formulate the monodromy constraint in the (df) coulomb gas approach spirit.

2

moreover, with the monodromy constraint alone we cannot dierentiate the behavior of

the dierent copies of doubled elds in the (opa).

many approaches have been developed to solve these problems. apparently the most

complete and general approach is the one developed by petkova [5]. this consists globally

in an adaptation of the principle of monodromy in the (df) coulomb gas formalism for

the (d) series models. the importance of this adaptation resides in that it permits to un-

derstand the technical aspects of the (df) formulation. however, despite its importance,

which will be of a great utility for us, this approach present many ambiguities regarding

its principle [6]1. it is important to mention the existence of another approach [7] which

call on other formalisms namely the lattice representation ( generalized rsos models) of

the ade models [8]. in this approach the ratios of the structure constants of the d or e

theories over the corresponding structure constants of the a theory of the same coxeter

number are determined. it was also mentioned in ref.[7] that these results do not seem

easy derived from crossing (bootstrap) equations and only phenomenological observations

are given.

what we propose in the present work is a simple and general approach to solve the

bootstrap equations without using the monodromy constraint. our approach is a general-

ization of the ideas initially developed in ref.[9] for the particular case of the d5 (cid:0)c = 3
5(cid:1)

model. the principle of the idea lays on the construction of the so called non-chiral fu-

sion rules. the non-chiral fusion rules determine the operator content of the operator

algebra. initially the term fusion rules was used to express how two representations of
1one of these adaptations is the normalization of the two point correlations by a factor equal to (1)s
rather than 1, where s is the spin two point eld. this redenition of the normalization factor is in

complete contradiction with unitarity. in fact, the inner product i of two of the highest weight states is

determined by [1] [10]:

i (|i ,|i) =

lim

z, w0

z 2hz2h h0|  (z, z)  (w, w)|0i
= (1)s 

we see that the factor ()s would give negative norm states.

the virasoro algebra combine in the (opa). the non-chiral fusion rules permit to avoid

the monodromy problem and hence to make a new step in the resolution of the bootstrap

equations. for the determination of the non-chiral fusion rules we use some considerations

imposing strict constraints. the rst constraint lays on the consistency of the non-chiral

fusion rules and the fusion rules (chiral). the second consideration, rather obvious, con-

sist on imposing the consistency of the non-chiral fusion rules with the operator content

determined by the modular constraint. the third important consideration, which is given

to construct the non-chiral fusion rules lays on symmetry considerations. this last consid-

eration is manifested by a discrete symmetry z2 which is dened by its action on the two
components of a doubled eld (): z2 () = . thus, this symmetry (z2) permit
to separate the doubled eld contribution by imposing the consistency of the non-chiral

fusion rules with its action. under the action of the z2 symmetry the scalar elds are

found to have a positive parity contrary to spin elds which have negative parity. as a

consequence; the consistency of the non-chiral fusion rules with the z2 action gives them
a z2  grading structure.

once the non-chiral fusion rules are determined, it is possible to solve the bootstrap

equations by considering that at short distance these equations should be consistent with

the (opa) which we have expressed through these rules. this is precisely what was done

in ref.[9] for the d5 model. here, we propose a generalization of these calculations to

the all set of dm models. for this end we use general analytic and duality proprieties of

conformal blocs in the coulomb gas formalism developed in ref. [5]. as a result, we have

found that the structure constants of the dm series models factories out in those of the

chiral algebra expressed by the am series. the signs of the structure constants are also

determined.

in our construction a particular role is played by z2 symmetry which reects the
z2  grading structure of the non-chiral fusion rules. a physical interpretation of the
z2 symmetry as a scaling limit symmetry of some lattice models namely the generalized

rsos [8] models is given. furthermore, we show the importance of discrete symmetries

4

and particularly the symmetry z2 in the classication of minimal models. these remarks

make our approach applicable in general for the large set of rational conformal eld

theories [11].

this article is organized as follows. in sec.2 we briey review some important results

of minimal models classication. we give in particular a precise analysis of the operator

content spectrum of (dm) unitary series. in sec.3 we present our approach by constructing

the non-chiral fusion rules. in sec.4 we solve the bootstrap equations and determine the

structure constants. in sec.5 we give a general analysis of our approach and extract some

important consequences and we conclude in sec.6.

2 general features of minimal models

one of the fundamental requirements in conformal eld theories is the existence of a

closed operator algebra. at two dimensions this requirement is expressed by the operator

product algebra of two primary elds which can be written in the form:

cijk (z  w)hkhihj (z  w)hkhihj [k (w, w) + . . .] .

i (z, z)  j (w, w) =xk
where i =(cid:0)i, i(cid:1) indicates dierent elds with i(cid:0)i(cid:1) representing the chiral contributions of

the halomorphic (antihalomorphic) sectors. hi and hi are the conformal dimensions of i

(1)

and the ellipsis stands for terms involving descendant elds. cijk are complex numbers

known as structure constants of the operator algebra.

the associativity of the operator product algebra in four point correlation functions

on the plane yields to symmetry relations termed as bootstrap equations:

gijkp (z, z) = hi (0)  j (z, z)  l (1)  k ()i
i j (p | z)

where f lm
correlation g are noted as t-channel and s-channel development respectively.

ij (p | z) denotes the conformal blocs. these two expressions (3) and (4) of the

in the case of degenerate representations of the virasoro algebra projecting out null

states imposes a strict constraint on conformal models. this yields a particular class of

conformal theories known as minimal models. for unitary minimal models the central

charge and the conformal dimensions of elds are conned to discrete values:

c (m) = 1 

6

m (m + 1)

,

hrs (m) = hmr,m+1s (m) =

((m + 1) r  ms)2  1

4 (m + 1) m

,

1  r  m  1, 1  s  m.

in these cases the conformal blocs are solutions of dierential equations. this later im-

portant fact, proved to give hard constraints on the operator algebra. these constraints

are expressed through the fusion rules, which determine how the chiral parts of physical
elds combine in the (opa). if we associate to each primary eld i, i = (r, s | r, s), its
chiral part (r, s); the fusion rules for minimal models will be given by:

min(r1+r2,2mr1r2+1)

min(s1+s2,2ms1s2+1)

(r1, s1)  (r2, s2) =

xk=|r1r2|+1

xl=|s1s2|+1

(k, l) .

(5)

on another hand, the modular constraint on the partition function, give a complete

classication of the operator content of minimal models: ade patterns [4]. first the

(a) series is diagonal so that the operator content is composed by spinless scalar elds.

for the d series the partition functions are non-diagonal. they can be organized in the

unitary case as follows:

2.1 spectrum analysis

from the partition functions of the d series unitary minimal models presented above,

we can summarize the operator content spectrum with respect to m values modulo 4 as

follows:

m

scalar elds

spin elds

m = 2 mod 4

m = 1 mod 4

m = 0 mod 4

m = 3 mod 4

(r, s | r, s)
(r, s | r, s)
(r, s | r, s) (r = odd)
(r, s | r, s) (s = odd)

(r, s | m  r, s)
(r, s | r, m + 1  s)
(r, s | m  r, s) (r = even)
(r, s | r, m + 1  s) (s = paire)

r = odd

s = odd

according to the operator spectrum one can distinguish two categories:

 m = 0 mod 4 and m = 3 mod 4 : these cases are noted as automorphism or per-
mutation invariant solutions. this notation comes from the fact that the modular

invariant partition functions can be written as: z = p(rs) rs(rs), where () is

some automorphism of fusion rules [12]. we remark in this category the existence

of a dierence in parity with respect to the indices r or s between the scalar and

spin elds. also, for the values r = m/2 (m = 0 mod 4) and s = (m + 1) /2

7

(m = 3 mod 4) the corresponding spin elds have a null spin; they are thus scalar

elds. for technical reasons, that we will see later, they are called null spin eld.

 m = 2 mod 4 and m = 1 mod 4 : these cases are noted as integer invariant solutions.
the partition functions of this category (6 - 7) can be regarded as diagonal invariant

solutions of a larger chiral algebra than originally considered (virasoro algebra) [10].

the eld extending this algebra is represented by a character appearing in the same

term as the identity character. this eld is thus: (cid:0)1, 1 | 1, m+1

for m = 2 mod 4 and m = 1 mod 4 respectively. what characterizes the operator

2 (cid:1) and (cid:0)1, 1 | 1, m
2(cid:1)

content of these cases in not the dierence in parity between the scalar and spin elds

with respect to the indices (r, s), but the appearance of two copies of certain scalar

elds. in fact, for m = 2 mod 4 (m = 1 mod 4) with r = m/2 (s = (m + 1) /2), the

corresponding spin elds have the forme:

(m/2, s | m/2, s) , m = 2 mod 4.
(r, (m + 1) /2 | r, (m + 1) /2) , m = 1 mod 4.

(10)

(11)

and have, thus, a forme of a null spin elds. furthermore we note that the same

elds are present in the scalar elds set so that we have two copies of these elds

(10 - 11) in the operator content spectrum. we note these two copies by + and

.

the operator content analysis in the case of the d unitary minimal models we have

developed will permit us later to give a simple and general description of the operator

algebra through the non-chiral fusion rules. at this point it is interesting to note that
the two cases m = 2 mod 4 and m = 1 mod 4 are symmetric via the permutations s  r,
m  m+1. this same remark is valid for m = 0 mod 4 and m = 3 mod 4. thanks to this,
the treatment of the d series unitary models can be reduced to the cases m = 3 mod 4

for the automorphism invariant cases and m = 1 mod 4 for the integer invariant cases.

3 non-chiral fusion rules

by denition the non-chiral fusion rules determine the operator content of the operator

algebra. therefore, the fusion of the two elds i and j produce the eld k if and only

if the structure constant cijk is non-vanishing. to construct the non-chiral fusion rules

in the case of minimal models we will use two important facts which are the consistency

of these rules with the fusion rules (chiral) and the operator content structure together

in fact, from the bootstrap equations we can get the following condition:

cijk 6= 0 


(i)  (j)  (k)
(cid:0)i(cid:1) (cid:0)j(cid:1) (cid:0)k(cid:1)

.

(12)

with (i)  (j)  (k) translating the fusion condition of (i) and (j) which give the eld
(k) . this condition indicates the consistency of the non-chiral fusion rules with the fusion

rules. the second condition that must be considered is the compatibility of the operator
algebra with the operator content spectrum. if we designate this spectrum by the set a
this condition becomes:

cijk 6= 0  i, j, k a.

(13)

for the series (a) models the application of these conditions lead to the known result

obtained by (df) by the monodromy invariance [3]:

(s1, r1 | s1, r1)  (s2, r2 | s2, r2) =

min(r1+r2,2mr1r2+1)

min(s1+s2,2ms1s2+1)

xk=|r1r2|+1

xl=|s1s2|+1

(k, l | k, l) .
(14)

3.1 d series non-chiral fusion rules

3.1.1 automorphism invariant cases

due to the dierent parities of indices indicating the scalar and spin elds, the non-chiral

fusion rules can be easily determined.

33 + 35

35 + 37

37 + 36

32 + 34

36.

(15)

we begin by determining the fusion rules (5) of the model. among other things we nd:

(15)  (15) = (11) + (13) + (15) ,
(17)  (53) = (55) ,
(16)  (14) = (13) + (15) ,
(16)  (36) = (31) + (33) ,
(15)  (12) = (14) + (16) ,

(12)  (16) = (15) + (17)
(12)  (32) = (31) + (33)
(15)  (15) = (12) + (14) .

finally to deduce the non-chiral fusion rules of the model d7, we combine the fusion rules

in the two sectors and use the consistency with the operator content. as a nal result we

obtain:

(1, 5 | 1, 5)  (1, 5 | 1, 5) = (1, 1 | 1, 1) + (1, 3 | 1, 3) + (1, 5 | 1, 5)
(1, 7 | 1, 7)  (5, 3 | 5, 3) = (5, 5 | 5, 5)
(1, 6 | 1, 2)  (1, 4 | 1, 4) = (1, 5 | 1, 5)
(1, 5 | 1, 5)  (1, 6 | 1, 2) = (1, 4 | 1, 4) + (1, 2 | 1, 6)
(1, 6 | 1, 2)  (3, 6 | 3, 2) = (3, 3 | 3, 3) + (3, 1 | 3, 1)

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

we remark that the fusion of two scalar elds or two spin elds produce only scalar

elds (rule (a), (b) and (e)). whereas, the fusion of scalar elds and spin elds produce
only spin elds (rule (d)). it is to be noted that the eld (1, 4 | 1, 4) which is a null spin
eld behaves like a spin eld in the non-chiral fusion rules (rule (c)). this justies the

name null spin eld.

10

the conclusions of the preceding example are valid in the most general case. this is

due, indeed, to the dierence in parity of the indices between the scalar elds and spin

elds. in fact, for m = 3 mod 4 the index s is odd for scalar elds and even for spin elds.
as a consequence, the fusion products have an index s with the parity of |s1  s2| + 1,
that is: odd if two elds have the same parity and even if they have dierent parity. by
symmetry s  r, the same argument is valid for the case m = 0 mod 4.

in conclusion, if we designate by a0 the set of scalar elds and a1 the set of spin and

null spin elds, the non-chiral fusion rules will have the forme:

ai  aj = ak, k = (i + j) mod 2

the so constructed non-chiral fusion rules have thus a z2  grading structure.

these fusion rules structure we have just determined translates an important fact

(especially for the remaining) which is the conservation of a parity in these rules. indeed,

if we aect a positive parity charge to the set of scalar elds (a0) and a negative parity
charge to the set of spin and null spin elds (a1) then the z2grading structure translates
the conservation of this charge in the non-chiral fusion rules.

3.2

integer invariant cases

for these dm series models there is no dierence in parity between the scalar and spin

elds and it is not possible to deduce simple rules as above. in addition and as we have

already remarked there is a doubling of certain elds. the two components of these elds

which we have noted + and  will have the same contribution in the (opa) and it

is not possible, thus, to distinguish between the behavior of each one in a correlation

function.

to overcome these diculties we use an important physical fact namely that by the

state-eld correspondence principle the presence of many copies of primary elds trans-

lates the degeneracy of the ground state. to lift this degeneracy we introduce a discrete

11

parity symmetry z2:

z2(cid:0)(cid:1) = 

(16)

the characterization of the z2 symmetry is complete if one arrives at dening its action on
the other elds of the model {}. to this end we use an important consideration which
is the consistency of the operator product algebra with the action of this symmetry.

this last consideration is expressed by adding to the two construction bases (12 - 13)

a third constraint which is the consistency of the non-chiral fusion rules with the z2

symmetry action, i.e. the dierent members in a fusion rule must have the same parity

(the conservation of z2 parity charge in the non-chiral fusion rules).

for the z2 symmetry construction we use the dm series with m = 1 mod 4. the same

argument is valid by symmetry for m = 2 mod 4.

3.2.1 construction of z2

the technique of a z2 parity symmetry in the construction of the non-chiral fusion rules

was initiated in ref.[9] for the particular case of the d5 model. in this work, the authors

were concerned only with thermic sub-algebra:

(cid:8)(15, 15) , (15, 11) , (11, 15) , +

13, 

13(cid:9) .

the construction of this symmetry is based on the consistence of its action with the

operator algebra. thus, from the fact that:

(15, 15)  (15, 11) = (11, 15)

one can see that the z2 action will be limited to the following cases [9]:

12

a) (15; 15)  + (15; 15) ,

(11; 15)  + (11; 15) ,

(15; 11)  + (15; 11)

b) (15; 15)  + (15; 15) ,

(11; 15)   (11; 15) ,

(15; 11)  (15; 11)

c) (15; 15)   (15; 15) ,

(11; 15)   (11; 15) ,

(15; 11)  + (15; 11)

d) (15; 15)   (15; 15) ,

(11; 15)  + (11; 15) ,

(15; 11)  (15; 11).

it worth noting that for the construction of the non-chiral fusion rules the rst two

construction bases along with the denition itself of these rules was not taken explicitly

in ref.[9]. this has as a consequence a great problem as we will see hereafter.

the consistency with the (z2) action (a)(d) leads each one of its own to dierent
structure of non-chiral fusion rules. to select the physical structure the consistency of

each one structure with the bootstrap equations was taken into consideration. therefore,

by a counter example the fusion rules constructed on the basis of the case (c) and (d)

are found inconsistent. the case (b) is presumed inconsistent and only the case (a) is

retained.

the most striking result of the calculus of the structure constants in the case (a) is the

vanishing of one of the constants [9]:

c+++ = 0

(17)

(with the notation + = (1, 3 | 13)+) although the coupling (+ + +) is permitted by
the fusion rules. this result was considered as specic by noting that     the van-
if one
ishing of c+++ follows from our calculations and not from the fusion rules.

returns to the denition of the non-chiral fusion rules as describing the operator con-

tent of the operator algebra the result (17) found in ref.[9] has nothing specic.

in

other words, this result is simply not consistent with the bootstrap equations. the ac-

tion of the z2 symmetry that produce non-chiral fusion rules consistent with the boot-

strap equations is limited only to the case (b) which was not considered in ref.[9].

13

in this case as an example of the non-chiral fusion rules for the d5 model we nd:

+  + = (1, 1 | 1, 1) + + + (1, 5 | 1, 5)
   = (1, 1 | 1, 1) + + + (1, 5 | 1, 5)
  + = 

(18)

 are the two copies of the degenerate eld (1, 3 | 1, 3).

the construction of z2 symmetry for the thermic subalgebra of the d5 model can be

straighforwardly extended to the remaining elds of the d5 model. in fact, the consistency

of the z2 symmetry action with the (opa):

(1, 1 | 1, 5)  (2, 1 | 2, 1) = (2, 1 | 2, 5) ,
(1, 5 | 1, 5)  (2, 1 | 2, 1) = (2, 5 | 2, 5)

(1, 1 | 1, 5)  (2, 1 | 2, 1) = (2, 5 | 2, 1)

leads to the following tree possibilities for the z2 action:

b1) (21; 21)  + (21; 21) , (25; 25)  + (25; 25) , (25; 2, 1)  + (25; 21) , (21; 25)  + (21; 25) .

b2) (21; 21)   (21; 21) , (25; 25)   (25; 25) , (25; 2, 1)  + (25; 21) , (21; 25)  + (21; 25) .

b3) (21; 21)  + (21; 21) , (25; 25)  + (25; 25) , (25; 2, 1)   (25; 21) , (21; 25)   (21; 25) .

by a strainghtforward manipulation of the bootstrap equations in these three cases, one

can see that only the case (b3) is consistent with bootstrap constraint.

a rst looking on the z2 symmetry for the d5 model which we have just determined,

one remark that scalar elds are singlet under z2 contrary to spin elds which has a

negative parity under z2. the negative parity component () of a degenerate eld

behave like a spin eld in the (opa) (null spin structure eld).

this construction of the z2 symmetry is done for the d5 model thermic subalgebra

and is worth to be generalized for the remaining dm models, m = 1 mod 4. applying the

14

same method as for the d5 for the whole set of dm (m = 1 mod 4) is somewhat a delicate

thing. the set of elds to take in consideration increases with (m) and the number of the

possibilities of the z2 becomes, therefore, important. to overcome this problem we shall

consider a simple intuitive analysis that lays on the following consideration: seeing that

the symmetry z2 is introduced by an ad-hoc manner in order to separate the contribution

of elds that double in the (opa) and having in mind the structure of the operator

content that is the same 2 one is tempted to nd that the z2 action follows a general law

independently from the model (i.e. from (m)).

thus the z2 symmetry action for the general dm models (m = 1 mod 4) have the same

structure action as the d5 model.

z2(cid:0)(cid:1) = ,

where s = spin elds and c = scalar elds.

z2 (s

) = s

, z2 (c

) = +c
.

(19)

now as the action of the z2 symmetry is found the non-chiral fusion rules are con-

structed by imposing the consistency of these rules with the action of this symmetry. in

other words this turn out to consider the conservation of a parity charge in these rules.

in consequence, the non-chiral fusion rules in the dm case m = 1, 2 mod 4, will have a
z2  grading structure at the same title as the cases m = 0, 3 mod 4.

conclusion for the non-chiral fusion rules

if we designate by a0, the set of scalar

elds and by a1 the set of spin and null spin elds the fusion rules will be of the forme

ai  aj = ak, k = (i + j) mod 2.

(20)

2this general symmetry structure is perceptible from the simple currents construction of the d series

[11].

4 structure constants

now as the fusion rules are constructed it is possible then to solve the bootstrap equations

in order to obtain the structure constants. we present thereafter the complete demon-

stration of this calculation. since the dm models have the same non-chiral fusion rules

structure (20) we restrict ourselves to the cases m = 1 mod 4.

4.1 notations

here we sketch the most intriguing properties of conformal blocs in coulomb gas con-

struction (for more details see [3] and [5]). for simplicity we limit ourselves to thermic

subalgebra. first let us consider the four point correlation functions:

g (z, z) = hn (z1, z1)  k (z2, z2)  k (z3, z3)  n (z4, z4)i .

(21)

z13z24(cid:17).
with n= (1, n | 1, n) denotes a eld in unitary minimal model spectrum and z =(cid:16) z12z34

these correlations can be written in coulomb gas formalism as follows:

g (z, z) = f (zi) f (zi)

n,n

xi,j

ij (a, b, c) i n

i (a, b, c; z) i

n

j (cid:0)a, b, c; z(cid:1) .

(22)

where ii (a, b, c; z) are conformal blocs in coulomb gas formulation and ij (a, b, c) are cou-
pling constants with the notations: a = 2+n, b = c = 2+k , d = 2+ (20  n) + =
m+1(cid:3)1/2 , 0 = h
(cid:2) m

2 (1  i) + and f (zi) = (z14)2(hk hn)

(z13z24)2hk z2nm (1  z)2mn .

, i = 1

1

m(m+1)i1/2

the conformal blocs have the short distance development:

lim
z0

i n

i (a, b, c; z) =(cid:2)z2nm(hn+hkhp)  n n

i (a, b, c)  (1 + o (z))(cid:3)p=nk+2i1 .

n n
i (a, b, c) is a normalization constant.

(23)

16

the correlations (22) are in the t-channel development. to express the s-channel devel-

opment we use the conformal blocs transformation under duality:

i n

i (a, b, c; z) =xj

ij (a, b, c) i n

j (b, a, c; 1  z) .

(24)

where ij (a, b, c) are elements of the monodromy matrices. therefore, the s-channel

correlations can be written as follows:

g (z, z) = f (zi) f (zi)

n,n

xk,i,j,l

ij (a, b, c) ikjli n

k (b, a, c; 1  z) i

ij (b, a, c) i n

i (b, a, c; 1  z) i

n

j (cid:0)b, a, c; 1  z(cid:1) .

(25)

4.2 bootstrap equations resolution

before solving the bootstrap equations for the dm series models let us consider rst this

resolution for the simplest cases of am series models. for these models and from the

(opa) we can write the correlation functions (21) at short distance as:

g (z) xp

n k(cid:1)2
(cid:0)c p
|z|2(hn+hkhp) (1 + o (z)) .

(26)

where (p ) denotes a eld permitted by the non-chiral fusion rules law (14) of (n) and

(k). the consistency of the correlations in the s-channel with the non-chiral fusion rules

imposes that only the diagonal terms are present in (22) and that from (23) and (26) the

structure constants are given by:

n k(cid:1)2 (cid:0)i (a, b, c)n 2
(cid:0)c p

i (a, b, c)(cid:1)p=nk+2i1 .

(27)

the i (a, b, c) are obtained by imposing the consistency of the correlations in the t-channel

with non-chiral fusion rules and which leads to the known result of (df) namely:

k (a, b, c) ki (a, b, c) kj (a, b, c) = i (b, a, c) ij.

(28)

xk

17

by imposing that c 1

n n = 1 one can deduce the proportionality factor in (27) and thus

obtain the nal forms of the structure constants of the (a) series models:

c p

n k =s i (a, b, c)

1 (b, a, c)

ni (a, b, c)
n1 (b, a, c)

.

(29)

now we propose to solve in the same manner the bootstrap equations for the dm series

models. the correlations to deal with are of the form (21) where n (with bold character)
is a spin eld (n = m + 1  n) or a negative parity copies  of a degenerate eld and k
is a scalar eld (m = m).

t-channel:

in the channel-t the correlations at short distance written on the basis of fusion rules

(20) are of the form:

g1 =xp,p

zhn+hkhp
12

n k (cid:1)2 p,m+1p
(cid:0)c p

zhn+hkhp
12

zhn+hkhp
34

zhn+hkhp
34

.

24 z2hp
z2hp

24

in terms of the conformal blocs these correlations are written as:

g1 = f (zi) f (zi)xi,j

(d)
ij

with:

(a, b, c | a, b, c) i n

i (a, b, c; z) i n

j (a, b, c; z) .

a = 2+n,

a = 2+m+1n,

b = c = 2+k.

at short distance one has:

with:

ii (a, b, c; z)  z2kn(hn+hkhp),
ij (a, b, c; z)  z2nk(hn+hkhp).




p = n  k + 2i  1
p = n  k + 2j  1

.

18

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

for the combination of conformal blocs (31) to be consistent with the non-chiral fusion
rules expressed by the development (30) it is necessary that: p = m + 1  p. if one takes
this result in the system (33), along with the fact that n = m + 1  n, one nds that:
j = n + 1  i.

in consequence the consistency of the non-chiral fusion rules and the combinations of

conformal blocs at short distance at t-channel imposes that only the coecients i,n+1i

are non zero. thus 3:

g1 = f (zi) f (zi)xi

(d)
i,n+1i (a, b, c | a, b, c) i n

i (a, b, c; z) i n

n+1i (a, b, c; z) .

for more convenience, we adopt the following notation for the coupling constants:

i,n+1i (a, b, c | a, b, c) = (d)
(d)

i

(a, b, c) = (d)

n+1i (a, b, c) .

the structure constants are obtained as limits at short distance of (34)

n k (cid:1)2  (d)
(cid:0)c p

i

(a, b, c)ni (a, b, c)nn+1i (a, b, c) .

s-channel:

(34)

(35)

(36)

in order to impose the bootstrap constraint we will develope (34) in the s-channel.

this is done by considering the duality transformation of the conformal blocs (24). thus,

the s-channel correlation functions are of the form:

g1 = f (zi) f (zi)xi,l,l

(d)
i

(a, b, c) il (a, b, c) n+1i,l (a, b, c)

i n
l (b, a, c; 1  z) i n

l (b, a, c; 1  z) .

(37)

this form of the correlations must be consistent at short distance with the non-chiral

fusion rules which state that only scalar elds are present in the fusion of two elds of the

3here we note the net dierence between our form of correlation function in the t-channel (34) and

the analogue (a.6) in the work [5]. one of these dierences is the absence of signs factor in our form.

it is in order to lift this signs factor that the normalization of the two point correlation functions was

redened in [5].

same nature. in other words only the diagonal terms are present in the correlations (37):

g1 = f (zi) f (zi)xl

(d)
l

(b, a, c) i n

l (b, a, c; 1  z) i n

l (b, a, c; 1  z) .

(38)

by comparing these two latter forms of s-channel correlations one can deduce that the
coupling constants (d)

(a, b, c) are solutions of the algebraic equation:

i

(d)
i

(a, b, c) il (a, b, c) n+1i,l (a, b, c) = (d)

l

(b, a, c) ll.

(39)

xi

the problem of determining the structure constants of the (dm) series models is reduced

then to the resolution of the algebraic equation (39). for this goal, we consider the

following analytic property of conformal blocs [5]:

i (a, b, c; z) = z2nm(hn+hmhp)in+1i (d, c, b; z) .
i n

this will permit in fact to deduce that:

with

n+1i,l (a, b, c) = i,l(cid:0)d, c, b(cid:1) .
d = 2+ (20  m+1k) .

at this level we were inspired by petkovas work [5]; i.e. by using the fact that:

d  a = (2  m)  n.

and that in these conditions:

il(cid:0)d, c, b(cid:1) = il(cid:0)d, b, c(cid:1) = (1)(da)(l1) il (a, b, c) .

now if we report these relations in (39) we arrive at the equation:

(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)

(d)
i

(a, b, c) il (a, b, c) il (a, c, b) = (1)(m2)(l1) (d)

l

(b, a, c) ll.

(44)

xi

to nd the solutions of this equation we consider its analogue of the (a) series (28). by

comparison we can derive the solutions of (44) under the form:

d
i (a, b, c; z) = a
i (b, a, c; z) = (1)(m2)(i1) a
d

i (a, b, c; z) ,

i (b, a, c; z) .

(45)

(46)

20

once the coupling constants are determined the structure constants of the(dm) series

models are given by:

n k (cid:1)2
(cid:0)c p

 (a)

i

(a, b, c)ni (a, b, c)nn+1i (a, b, c) .

(47)

to write this last result in more convenient form we use the fact that if |a  a| is an
integer then4:

(a)
i

(a, b, c) = (a)

i

(a, b, c) .

and immediately we can show that:

(a)
i

(a, b, c) = (a)

n+1i (d, c, b) = (a)

n+1i (a, c, b) = (a)

n+1i (a, b, c) .

using this last result in (47) we nd nally:

n k (cid:1)2  (cid:18)q(a)
(cid:0)c p
n k  c p

= c p

i

n k .

(a, b, c)ni (a, b, c)(cid:19)(cid:18)q(a)

n+1i (a, b, c)nn+1i (a, b, c)(cid:19) ,

(48)

we see thus that the structure constants of the dm series factorizes out in those of the

chiral algebra expressed by the am series. another important result can be deduced from

(46) concerning the signs of the product of the structure constants namely:

n ndf

s(cid:0)c f

k k(cid:1) = (1)(m2)( f 1

2 ) .

since the scalar elds constitute a subalgebra in the (opa) we can chose the signs of

the structure constants of this subalgebra arbitrarily. by opting for positive signs we can

deduce that:

s(cid:0)c f

n n(cid:1) = (1)(m2)( f 1

2 )

(49)

this last result is obtained by the resolution of the bootstrap equations realized from dual-

ity symmetry of correlations of the form (21). to determine the signs of the structure con-

stants between general couplings c f

n k we must consider more general correlation forms.

this

can

properties

nection established in refs.[5, 7]. we nd that the result (49) is general .

5 discrete symmetries of minimal models

we make appear a z2 discrete symmetry in the construction of the non-chiral fusion rules.

this symmetry has appeared automatically in the automorphism invariant cases through
the z2  grading structure of the non-chiral fusion rules. in the integer invariant cases,
the z2 symmetry was put into evidence in a dierent manner and this as a consequence

of the existence of two copies of some scalar elds. the fusion rules obtained have also a
z2  grading structure.

essentially, the z2 symmetry appear for the whole set of the dm series as a conse-
quence of the z2  grading structure of the fusion rules. these structure expresses the
conservation of a parity charge in these rules. in fact, the z2 permit to associate a positive

parity to the scalar elds and a negative one to spin and null spin elds. this important

fact suggests us to nd a physical interpretation of the (z2) symmetry.

5.1 the ade classication as lattice models

the fact that the universal critical properties are controlled by the long range uctuations

enable to treat them by a continuum eld theory; conformal invariant at the critical

point. the richness of the conformal symmetry in two dimensions makes it possible the

classication of the universality classes. the ade classication of the minimal models

present a typical example of such classication.

in addition the universality principle of critical phenomena makes it conceivable to

construct a statistical model of spin on lattice for all universality classes(conformal model).

22

thus, one nds that the critical properties of the critical and the tricritical three states

potts models are given by the d series with m = 5 and m = 4 respectively; the ising

model at the other hand is described by the a series with m = 3.

nowadays it is established that the whole set of unitary minimal models of the ade

classication expresses the critical proprieties of the models said (rsos) [8]. the formula-

tion of these models (rsos) is realized on the basis of the simple lie algebra of type ade

where at each site of the lattice is attributed a weight variable. these weights correspond

to those of coxeter-dynkin diagram for a simple lie ade algebra with the condition

that two closest neighbors have neighboring weights in the coxeter-dynkin diagram.

none of these models has a continuum symmetry but on the contrary they have discrete

symmetries. in this respect, we nd as an example that the three state potts models have

a discrete symmetry s3 which is a sum of cyclic discrete symmetries z3 and z2 and the

ising model has a z2 cyclic symmetry. for the whole set of rsos models the discrete

symmetries are nothing but the automorphism group of the coxeter-dynkin diagrams.

in consequence the whole set of these models have a z2 symmetry except the d4, d5, e7

and e8 models. the diagrams of d5 and d4 have an s3 symmetry and those of e7 and

e8 have no symmetry.

the minimal models and their ade classication involve in their construction only

the conformal symmetry and modular invariance (i.e. periodic) of partition functions.

so it is of importance to know if this classication is consistent with the presence of

other discrete symmetries. this is very important, indeed, because the critical properties

have a strong dependence on symmetries and if the ade classication describes the

critical behavior ( universality classes) of the rsos models then it must be consistent

with the presence of discrete symmetries of these lattice models. this is exactly what

was done in a recent work [14] where the consistency of the ade classication with the

presence of discrete cyclic (zn) symmetries is was investigated. the result found therein

conrm that only symmetries which are present in the rsos models are consistent with

the ade classication. another important result determined in ref.[14] is the action of

23

these discrete symmetries on primary elds. for the particular cases of the d series and

z2 symmetry this action is exactly identical to that of our z2 symmetry, found in the

construction of the non-chiral fusion rules. instead the discrete symmetry z2 of the d

series rsos models appear through the consistency of the non-chiral fusion rules with

the action of this symmetry.

this important constatation leads us to think to construct for the three state potts

models d5 (d4) the non-chiral fusion rules consistent with the other symmetry of these

models namely (z3) symmetry. this construction will be done for the d5 critical three

state potts model and it will be available by symmetry to the d4 tricritical three state

potts model.

5.2 z3 construction for d5 model

the critical three states potts model is a spin lattice model with discrete spin complex
variable  = exp (i) ;  = 0, 2

3 . the lattice hamiltonian of this model is given by:

h = jxx,i

1

2(cid:0)x

x+i + 

xx+i(cid:1)

(51)

where (x) denotes lattice spin position and (i) the neighboring position.

at the scaling limit the discrete spin variables become continues operators  (x) . it

is natural also to identify the density energy operator  (x) from (51) as the scaling limit

of the interaction term x

x+i + 

have a scaling dimension equal to  = 2
and  = 4

xx+i. these two identied operator were known to
15 for the spin complex operator  (x) ( (x))
5 for the energy density operator. the complex nature of the spin variable
 (x) is one of the reasons that the critical three states potts model is identied with

the d5 model rather than the diagonal a5 model [13]. in fact, from the spin variable we
can dene two real spin variables:  +  and    which reect the presence of two
copies of the same scalar real primary eld in the model. as a consequence and from the
operator content of the d5 we can identify  +  and    with the two copies  of

24

the doubled eld (2, 3 | 2, 3) and hence write the complex spin variable as:

(52)

1

 =

2(cid:0)+ + i(cid:1)

in addition the energy density eld can be identied with the scalar eld (2, 1 | 2, 1).

the hamiltonian (51) is invariant under the discrete cyclic symmetry (z3) dened

with its action on the spin variable as:

z3 ( (x)) = exp(cid:18) 2i

3 (cid:19)  (x)

(53)

from the operator product expansion, one can show that the second doubled eld (2, 3 | 2, 3)
which can be represented as a complex eld () like (52) transforms under (z3) in the

same way as  (x) (53). the other non doubled elds were invariant under (z3) because

each of them are conjugate5 to itself in the operator product expansion.

5.2.1 the z3 non-chiral fusion rules

from the action of the z3 symmetry we can easily deduce, as was done for the z2 sym-

metry, the non-chiral fusion rules consistent with its action. this is what was considered

in a second work [13] by the author of ref.[9]. for example one nds that:

   = 
   = 1 + (1, 5 | 1, 5) + (1, 5 | 11) + (1, 1 | 1, 5)

  (1, 1 | 1, 5) = 
  (2, 1 | 2, 1) =  + 

(54)

in [13] it was noted that the solutions obtained from the two constructions namely (z2) and

(z3) are ..., of course, inequivalent.. if the two constructions are really inequivalent one
5the conjugate eld c of a eld  is dened by the condition that the opa of these two elds

produce the identity eld:

c    1

25

can deduce that if (54) produce the (opa) content of the critical three states potts model

then the (z2) (opa) structure describes another critical model, which is ambiguous. the

(z2) as (z3) are both discrete symmetries of the three state potts model so that the (opa)

structure obtained from these two symmetries must be equivalent. the error committed

in [9] is that the good action (the (a) case rather than the (b) case) of the (z2) symmetry

was not considered. we propose now to establish the equivalence between the (z3) and

(z2) structure of the (opa). this is done easily by calculating the fusion for example of

 and . from the rules (18) one nds that:

1

1

   =
=



2(cid:0)+ + i(cid:1) (cid:0)+  i(cid:1)
2(cid:2)+  + +    + i(cid:0)+      +(cid:1)(cid:3)


+i

c+   + c+  (15|11) + c+  (11|15)  c + 



1 + c+ + + + c+ + (15|15) + 1 + c  + + c  (15|15)

c + (15|11)  c + (11|15)




(55)

using the fact that: c  + = c+ + + and c+ + (15,15) = c  (15,15) deduced from the signs
of the structure constants (50) and the fact that:

cabc = (1)s(a)+s(b)+s(c) cbac = (1)s(a)+s(b)+s(c) ccba

we deduce that:

   = 1 + (1, 5 | 1, 5) + (1, 5 | 1, 1) + (1, 1 | 1, 5)

in the same way we can proof that:

   = 

(56)

what we have just proved through equation (56) is the equivalence of the two construc-

tions of the non-chiral fusion rules based on the z2 and z3 symmetries. what we have

exactly done is the following: if we consider the non-chiral fusion rules as a commutative

and associative ring (in the same way as the fusion rules [15]) with as a basis the set of

primary elds of the dm model then by transformation (52) we have achieved a change

26

of basis. the z2 symmetry structure of the fusion rules in the real basis is manifested by

the complex z3 symmetry in the new complex basis (52).

the question that is of interest to answer at this stage is the very prediction of the

existence of the complex cyclic symmetry (zn ) for the other models of the (dm) series

as we have done for the d5 (d4) models of the (z3) symmetry. indeed if such symmetry

exists it cannot be but a cyclic symmetry of order 3 (z3). this turns out to prove the

equivalent of the equation (56) with:

 =

1

2(cid:0)+ + i(cid:1)
| 1,

m + 1

2

 = (cid:18)1,

(57)

m + 1

2 (cid:19)

in fact, the change to the complex basis cannot be consistent with the (opa) i.e.  
1; but for the values of m = 5 mod 8 (m = 6 mod 8) and for this cases precisely and by

following the same approach as for (d5) model we can show that it is not possible to have

a form consistent with (56). this meets the results found in ref.[14].

6 general discussions

in this work we have proposed an approach to solve the bootstrap equations in the case

of the minimal and unitary models of dm series. this approach consists in the very

construction of the non-chiral fusion rules which determines the operator content of the

operator algebra. once these fusion rules are determined it will be possible to solve the

bootstrap equations by considering the consistency of these equations at short distance

with these rules.

for the dm series models the non-chiral fusion rules found have a z2  grading struc-
ture. this later reects, directly in the automorphism invariant cases, the existence of a
z2 symmetry. in the integer invariant cases the z2  grading structure was instead de-
duced as a consequence of the doubling of certain scalar elds and therefore the existence

27

of discrete parity symmetry z2. this symmetry has been interpreted as scaling limit of z2

symmetry of the d-like (rsos) spin lattice models. in addition, beginning from the non-

chiral fusion rules consistent with the z2 action and the signs of the structure constants,

we succeeded in nding the non-chiral fusion rules consistent with z3 symmetry for the

three state potts models d5 (d4). also we have proved that the existence of other discrete

cyclic symmetries was not possible for the remaining of the dm models. regarding the

rsos lattice construction this symmetries structure of the dm model is nothing but the

automorphism group of the d coxeter-dynkin diagrams [8].

a further important interpretation of the manifestation of these discrete symme-

tries for minimal models is given in [18]. in fact, goddard, kent and olive (gko) [17]

gave a coset construction to generate the unitary minimal models from unitary rep-
resentation of su2 (k)  su2 (1) /su2 (k + 1). the su2 models are z2 invariant and
so is the (gko) coset construction of minimal unitary models. at another hand, it

turns out that the three state potts models can also be realized as coset construction of
su3 (k) su3 (1) /su3 (k + 1) which is z3 invariant. thus these last models carry a z3
as well as z2 symmetry.

these remarks give to our approach a possibility to be generalized to other conformal

models namely rational models. for these models and particularly in the case of kac-
moody chiral algebras the non-chiral fusion rules in the dlike series may be structured
following a discrete symmetry which is a center or a subalgebra of the center of the chiral

algebra. for a coset construction g/h the discrete symmetry is a subalgebra of the center

of g that preserves h. a convenient manner to formulate the problem is presented in

another work of the present auctors [11]. this later is based, in the same way as in this

work, on the consistency of the non-chiral fusion rules with the chiral fusion rules and

with the operator content derived from the modular constraint. the discrete symmetry
structure is introduced simply by the simple currents construction of dlike series.
this framework this symmetry is nothing but the eective center of the simple currents

in

utilized in modular invariant construction [19].

28

finally it is important to mention a possible connection of the discrete symmetry

structure of the non-chiral fusion rules with a reection group of what is known as graphs

construction [7, 16]. these graphs are a generalization of the ade coxeter-dynkin

diagrams; so a possible integrable lattice interpretation and construction of the (opa)

and structure constants my be envisaged.
