flat-space scattering and bulk locality
in the the ads/cft correspondence

abstract

the large radius limit in the ads/cft correspondence is expected to provide a holo-

graphic derivation of at-space scattering amplitudes. this suggests that questions of

locality in the bulk should be addressed in terms of properties of the s-matrix and their

translation into the conformal eld theory. there are, however, subtleties in this trans-

lation related to generic growth of amplitudes near the boundary of anti-de sitter space.

flat space amplitudes are recovered after a delicate projection of cft correlators onto

normal-mode frequencies of ads. once such amplitudes are obtained from the cft, possi-

ble criteria for approximate bulk locality include bounds on growth of amplitudes at high

energies and reproduction of semiclassical gravitational scattering at long distances.

1. introduction

maldacenas proposed correspondence[1] between string (or m) theory on ads5  s5
and n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimensions has stimulated a great deal
of recent excitement.1 a particularly fascinating aspect of this correspondence is that it
apparently serves as a concrete realization of holographic ideas [3,4]. although a great

deal of work has been done to deduce properties of the large-n yang-mills conformal

eld theory from this correspondence, an even more interesting question is how to deduce

properties of string/m theory from the the boundary conformal eld theory.

several steps have recently been taken in this direction.

in particular, in [5,6] the

relationship between boundary correlators and an ads analog of the s-matrix (called

the boundary s-matrix in [6]) was described. this work had been closely preceded by

related work [7,8] which sketched a prescription to derive at space s-matrix elements in

the innite radius r limit of ads space; one naturally expects this s-matrix to be an
appropriate r   limit of the boundary s-matrix of [5,6].

this paper will investigate this question: in particular, it will address the issue of how

at-space s-matrix elements can be obtained from conformal eld theory data. as we will

nd, this is somewhat nontrivial.

a useful analogy to bear in mind is that between anti-de sitter space and a resonant

cavity. if one quantizes a free eld in ads, generic frequencies produce non-normalizable

states, and the normalizable states correspond to a discrete set of frequencies and are

analogous to cavity modes. since there are no true asymptotic states among these modes,

its not a priori clear how to formulate scattering problems. here the example of a resonant

cavity serves as a guide. consider for example two atoms at diametrically opposite ends of

the cavity, and suppose one is in an excited state, and one in the ground state. even when

the transition energy is not a normal-mode frequency of the cavity, it is possible for atom

one to decay to its ground state with atom two transitioning to the corresponding excited

state. or one may have more atoms, acting as emitters and detectors, and the emitted

particles may mutually scatter before being detected. such gedanken experiments give a
framework to discuss scattering.2

1 for a recent review and extensive set of references, see [2].
2 another possibility in the resonant cavity case is to cut small holes in the wall of the cavity
through which particles may enter and exit. this clearly more dicult for ads space, although
an analogous construction exists for the case where an ads bubble is embedded in a space with
asymptotic particle states, and these states must penetrate a potential barrier to reach the interior
of ads, as described in [5,6].

1

this analogy is not perfect. for one thing, ads space has much more volume at innity

than at space, and this together with growth at innity of the wavefunctions at non-

normalizable frequencies can have important consequences. in particular, as well see, these

combined eects can lead to growth of interaction strengths near the ads boundary if we

work with states at non-normalizable frequencies. this poses a diculty for extracting at-

space scattering amplitudes in the center of a large radius anti-de sitter space. an obvious

retort is that one should project scattering amplitudes onto normalizable frequencies, with

a corresponding projection on the correlators of the boundary cft. however, this is not

made any easier by our lack of knowledge of the spectrum of normalizable states at the

multiloop or non-perturbative levels, except in the case of protected states. we will discuss

this problem and possible resolutions in more detail.

if we assume that it is indeed possible to extract at-space s-matrices from the confor-

mal eld theory, another profound question arises. if the correspondence of [1] is correct,

the theory in the bulk should exhibit approximate d+1-dimensional locality, in an appropri-

ate low-energy limit. although the bulk theory is conjectured to be string theory, which is

manifestly non-local, this non-locality is expected to only be apparent at the string scale

(in some appropriate sense), or perhaps in black hole experiments. the theory should be

macroscopically local, namely it should give low-energy, weak eld amplitudes that are

derivable from a local low-energy eective eld theory. an important question is what

property of the boundary cft implies macroscopic bulk locality in the large radius limit

of anti-de sitter space? also, one would like to better characterize and understand the

nonlocalities, and their possibly quite important implications.

to address this question we need a way to diagnose locality. from at least two view-

points (gauge invariance, holography) it was expected that the ads/cft correspondence

would only yield s-matrix elements  not o-shell amplitudes  and direct study has par-

tially conrmed this [7,8,5,6]. therefore we need a way of inferring from the s-matrix

whether  or to what extent  the underlying theory is local. various bounds exist for

s-matrices derived from local theories, or even from generalizations to theories with non-

local behavior above a denite energy scale. however, derivation of these bounds becomes

problematic in the case of theories with massless particles, and particularly for theories

with gravity. there is some related information about the high-energy structure of string

scattering amplitudes, but at present nothing that serves as a denitive test of locality

near the string scale. at macroscopic scales, one important test of locality is that the

2

theory correctly produce semiclassical gravity amplitudes or other coulombic behavior, at

long distances or equivalently small momentum transfer.

yet another question that can be addressed is that of whether, or to what extent,

the underlying bulk theory can be reconstructed from complete knowledge of the s-matrix

elements. this is a dicult problem, and in general the solution is not unique. a few

comments about this problem will also be made.

the paper will begin with a brief review of the maldacena conjecture, as formulated

by gubser, klebanov, polyakov, and witten. the next section will then describe the basic

properties of the large radius limit for ads. section four will then turn to the question

of whether, and how, bulk at-space s-matrix elements can be extracted from bound-

ary conformal eld theory correlators in the large radius limit. if the latter are written in

frequency space, an important distinction occurs between frequencies corresponding to nor-

malizable and non-normalizable modes; at frequencies corresponding to non-normalizable

modes, boundary correlators receive important contributions from regions near the bound-

ary of anti-de sitter space. this behavior poses some diculty for extracting the at-space

s-matrix, although outlines of a procedure will be given. section ve contains some discus-

sion of the problem of investigating the bulk locality properties of the theory, as well as on

the problem of reconstructing the bulk theory. following the conclusion is a rather lengthy

appendix containing a number of useful properties of anti-de sitter space, its propagators,

and the large radius limit. many of these appear previously in the literature, although

there are some new results.

2. review of the gkpw correspondence

we begin by recalling the precise form of the correspondence for local correlators, as

formulated by gubser, polyakov, klebanov and witten [9,10], and extended to lorentzian

signature in [11,12]. this paper will use global coordinates x = (, , ) for the cover of

anti-de sitter space,

ds2 =

r2

cos2 

(d 2 + d2 + sin2  d2

d1) .

(2.1)

the boundary has topology sd1r, or alternatively can be represented as the conformally
equivalent innite-sheeted cover of minkowski space. a point on the boundary sphere

can be specied by a d-dimensional unit vector e; boundary points are parameterized as

b = (, e).

3

the basic statement of this correspondence is

z[(0)] = ht eir

db 0(b) o(b)i .

(2.2)

in this formula labels for dierent elds and their corresponding operators have been

suppressed. on the left hand side is the bulk partition function for string theory on
ads5  s5 with both radii set to r. this is evaluated with bulk elds  constrained to
obey the boundary condition

(2.3)

(2.4)

where the constants h and , dened by



/2
 (cos )2h+0(b)

4h = d pd2 + 4m2r2 = d  2 ,

for a eld of mass m, govern the asymptotic behavior of the eld. the right side is the
corresponding generating functional for cft correlation functions in n = 4 su(n) yang-
mills theory. the operator o corresponding to  has conformal weight  = 2h+. the
y m n )1/4
parameters of the theories are related by gs = g2
for the ads5  s5 radius.

y m for the couplings, and r = (g2

at the level of correlation functions, the correspondence (2.2) may be rewritten as

ht (o(b1)o(b2)  o(bn))i = z

n

yi=1

[dxigb (bi, xi)]gt (x1,    , xn) .

(2.5)

in this expression gb (bi, xi) denotes the full (multiloop) bulk-boundary propagator, and
gt (x1,    , xn) denotes a bulk n-point green function with its external legs truncated.
some properties of bulk and bulk-boundary propagators will be reviewed in the appendix.

in particular, the basic issues will be illustrated using the relation between four-point

functions,

hto1(b1)  o4(b4)i = z

4

yi=1

[dxigb(bi, xi)] gt (x1, . . . , x4) .

(2.6)

as a concrete example, consider truncating string theory down to a scalar sector with a
three-point coupling, as in [13], and suppressing dependence on the s5 coordinates:

s = z dv (cid:20) 1

2

()2 +

m2
2

2 + g3(cid:21) .

to leading order in the coupling, the cft correlator is given by a term of the form

hto1(b1)  o4(b4)itree,t =  g2z dv dv hkb(b1, x)kb(b3, x)kb(x, x)

(2.7)

(2.8)

plus s and u channel contributions, where kb is the bulk feynman propagator for the 
eld, and kb is the tree-level bulk-boundary propagator.

kb(b2, x)kb(b4, x)i

3. the large-r limit

our goal is to recover at-space s-matrix elements from boundary correlators.

in

order to extract these we must consider the regime of large r, where the ads geometry
has a large region (of size o(r)) that is approximately at.

the relation between the large-r geometry of ads and at space is easily exhibited

in the global coordinates (2.1). an arbitrary point p of ads space can be moved to the

origin (, ) = (0, 0) by an so(2, d) transformation. for large r, we can readily recover

the nearly at metric in the vicinity of p in spherical polar coordinates by dening

t = r ; r = r .

then the metric (2.1) becomes

ds2 =

1

cos2(r/r) hdt2 + dr2 + r2 sin2(

r
r

)2d2i .

(3.1)

(3.2)

for r  r, this clearly reduces to the at metric.

since the spacetime in the vicinity of p is approximately at, one expects to recover

at-space physics in this region. for example, consider the bulk feynman propagator,

which appeared in the amplitude (2.8). this has been given in closed form in terms of a

hypergeometric function[14,15], and the large r limit of this expression is derived in the

appendix. the result is, for particles3 of masses <o(1/r),

ikb(x, x) =

c

[s2(x, x) + i](d1)/2 ,

(3.3)

where c is a constant given in the appendix, and s(x, x) is the geodesic distance between
the points x and x. this is the standard at-space propagator for a massless eld.

4. s-matrices at large r?

wed like to determine whether the at-space s-matrix can be extracted from the

conformal correlators, such as (2.8), in the limit of large r. to begin with, recall the form

of the at-space s-matrix for the process corresponding to that of (2.8). this is simply the

3 the case of massive particles, m  o(1/r), can also be treated.

5

tree-level, t-channel contribution to the at-space s-matrix, which is given by a fourier

transform of the feynman propagator:

smink,t(s, t) = g2z dd+1xdd+1xei(k1+k3)xei(k2+k4)x

kf (x, x)

= ig2(d+1)(k1 + k2 + k3 + k4)

1
t

.

(4.1)

the general question at hand is how to extract the s-matrix, for example (4.1), di-

rectly from the corresponding contribution to the cft correlation function, for example

(2.8). note that these formulas appear very similar. by the lsz prescription, the at

s-matrix consists of truncated at-space n-point functions, convoluted against on-shell

wavefunctions; this should be compared to (2.8), which has the identical structure with

bulk-boundary propagators replacing at-space wavefunctions. this served as a central ob-

servation behind the interpretation of the conformal correlators as providing a boundary

s-matrix for anti-de sitter space[5,6].

in searching for a general prescription to extract the at-space s-matrix from the

ads/cft correspondence, we will begin by reverse engineering the expression (2.8) to

see how the corresponding piece of the s-matrix could be extracted from this contribution

to the conformal correlators. this will allow us to infer some lessons for the more general

problem of the complete s-matrix.

weve just seen that at large r the contribution from kb to the correlator reduces to
the expected at-space expression. therefore, the remaining task is to understand whether

the contributions from the factors kb can be related to on-shell, at-space wavefunctions
in the minkowski region. some properties of kb are reviewed in the appendix. given
the relationship (3.1), it is convenient to work with the frequency conjugate to the global

ads time  , as this also corresponds to denite minkowski energy,

 = er .

in frequency space, the relation (2.8) becomes

hto(1, e1)  o(4, e4)itree,t =  g2z dv dv hkb(1, e1; x)kb(3, e3; x)
kb(x, x)kb(2, e2; x)kb(4, e4; x)i .

(4.2)

(4.3)

it will turn out that there is an important distinction between the cases where the frequency

of the external state is generic, corresponding to a non-normalizable mode, and where it

is that of one of the normalizable modes. we will consider these in turn.

6

4.1. generic frequencies

in the case where the i dont correspond to normal-mode frequencies, the bulk-
boundary propagator must be a non-normalizable solution of the scalar wave equation.

one can most easily explore the consequences of this by working in a partial-wave basis;

as seen from (3.2) (and also shown in terms of generators in the appendix), ads angular

momentum is directly identied with minkowski angular momentum in the large-r limit.

in an angular momentum basis and at arbitrary frequency, the bulk-boundary propagator

has asymptotic behavior

kb(, l, ~m; x)  ei y l ~m(cos )2h .

(4.4)

from this we immediately see a problem in extracting the at-space s-matrix, (4.1), di-

rectly from (4.3). in order to do so, wed like kb to be convolved with wavefunctions that
have their support concentrated in the at region r  r. however, the behavior (4.4)
ensures that all linear combinations of the non-normalizable modes grow like (cos )2h
at innity, and thus are concentrated in the region r  r instead. indeed, consider the
behavior of the integral over x in (4.3). the volume element is

dv =

rd+1(sin )d1

(cos )d+1

d ddd1 ,

and so near  = /2 the  part of the integral takes the form

 z d

(sin )d1

(cos )d+1 (cos )4hkb(x, x)  z d

1

(cos )2+1 kb(x, x) .

(4.5)

(4.6)

thus the wave-function factor convolving the bulk green function has its main support in
the vicinity   /2.4 for non-normalizable frequencies, there is no apparent way to obtain
a limit in which one recovers the desired asymptotic fallo of at-space wavefunctions for
r large but r  r without also encountering this growth at innity.

evidence for this behavior can also be seen directly in position space. as shown in

the appendix, the position space bulk-boundary propagator takes the form

kb(b, x) = cb (cid:20)

cos 

cos(  )  sin e  e(cid:21)2h+

(4.7)

4 this is directly connected to the fact that, in the more general case of scalar elds of unequal

masses, the integral (4.6) only converges for certain values of the scalar masses[13].

7

up to the i prescription (see appendix). this is singular for points on the boundary light
cone: at points such that cos()ee = 0, it has behavior  (/2)2h+ at   /2.
in (2.8), the product of the rst two bulk-boundary propagators will be singular on the

intersection of their boundary light cones; this behavior is exacerbated by the growth of

the volume element.

these arguments, suggest that for generic frequencies ads holography is in a sense

only skin deep.

4.2. normalizable frequencies

we now turn to the case where all the external frequencies i correspond to those of
normalizable modes. to investigate this case, recall that the bulk-boundary propagator
can be found as a limiting case of the bulk propagator,5

gb (b, x) = 2ird1 lim
/2

(cos )2h+gb(x, x) ,

(4.8)

and that the feynman propagator can be written in the form

ikb(x, x) = z d

2 xnl ~m

ei( ) nl ~m(, e)nl ~m(, e)

2  2

nl  i

.

(4.9)

the normalizable wavefunctions nl ~m(, e) have asymptotic behavior

nl ~m(, e)

/2
 knl(cos )2h+yl ~m(e)

(4.10)

for certain constants knl (see appendix). the frequency-space form of kb is thus

kb(, e; x) = 2rd1ei  xn,l, ~m

knly l ~m(e)nl ~m(, e)

2  2

nl  i

.

(4.11)

from (4.11) we see that extracting the normalizable-frequency piece is rather deli-

cate. we want only the contribution corresponding precisely to the normalizable-mode

frequency, in order to eliminate the above non-normalizable behavior. the green function

is divergent at this frequency; one must extract the residue at the pole. once one takes

into account higher-loop corrections, these frequencies are not a-priori known (though they

should be determined by knowledge of the exact conformal weights), and the frequency-

space behavior of the amplitude may be more complicated. these factors pose signicant

5 for more details, see the appendix.

8

diculties. nevertheless, let us assume that we are able to perform these steps, and see

where they lead.

thus, we dene a modied bulk-boundary propagator by

k(n, l, ~m, x) = lim
nl

(2  2

nl)kb(, l, ~m, x)

= 2nli d
= 2rd1einl knlnl ~m(x) .

kb(, l, ~m, x)

2i

(4.12)

the corresponding operations can be performed directly on cft correlators, where they

are the operations needed to project onto a denite state of the cft.

the modied propagator (4.12) does reproduce on-shell wavefunctions in at space.
indeed, in the appendix it is shown that in the r  r limit, the modes nl ~m go over into
the at-space wavefunctions,

nl ~m(~x) r 2e

1

rd/21 jl+d/21(er)yl ~m(e) .

likewise, the coecients knl can be worked out, with the result

k(n, l, ~m, x) r c(e, r)il

1

(er)d/21 jl+d/21(er)y l ~m(e)

with coecient function

c(e, r) =

22
()

(1)er/2h+(er)2h+ .

(4.13)

(4.14)

(4.15)

in fact, this can easily be transformed back to position space on the boundary, giving6

k(e, e; x) = xl, ~m

yl ~m(e) k(n, l, ~m, x) r

c(e, r)

(2)d/2 ei~k~x ,

(4.16)

a plane wave with ~k = e e.

putting all of this together suggests tree-level prescriptions for extracting at-space

s-matrix elements from boundary correlators:

6 note that the following is valid to the extent that contributions from very large l dont
contribute to the sum over all l. such contributions give ads corrections to the plane waves.
these can be suppressed by consideration of wavepackets with spatial spread < r.

9

where nili = eir is a normal mode frequency, and ki = ei(1, ei).

however, at the multiloop level these expressions are potentially problematical. in

particular, one doesnt a-priori know the frequencies to tune i to in order to sit on a
normalizable mode, and the analytic structure in  may contain more than just simple poles

at these frequencies. one possible approach to this problem  given complete knowledge

of the yang-mills correlators  would be to take a correlator and look for the frequencies

where poles appear, extract the residues at these poles, and then use the result to construct

the at-space s-matrix along the above lines. these frequencies are approximately given

by locating the poles in the boundary two-point function, which at tree level takes the

form (see appendix)

.

(4.18)

however, interactions will in general shift the energy of the two-particle state relative to

twice the single-particle energy, causing added diculty in precisely identifying the relevant

frequencies.

another approach, advocated in [7,8], is to convolve the boundary correlators with

appropriately chosen wavepackets. this appears to have some diculty, as we can see

from (4.11). if f (, e) is the wavepacket prole for one of the external states, then it is

connected to the rest of the diagram through a factor of the form

z ddd1f (, e)kb(, e, x)

= z ddd1f (, e) xn,l, ~m

2rd1 knly l ~m(e)nl ~m(, e)

.

for any regular f this receives contributions from non-normalizable frequencies even if f

is sharply peaked near a specic normalizable frequency. this in turn implies sensitivity
to contributions from interactions at r  r, as described in sec. 4.1. it is not clear how
to make wavepackets focussed in the minkowski region from these modes.

a modication of this procedure would be to rst extract the amplitudes restricted

to normalizable frequencies, as outlined above. then wavepackets can be built by taking

linear combinations of those with dierent normal mode frequencies.

these results suggest that while it may be possible to derive at-space s-matrix el-

ements from the ads/cft correspondence, the procedure is not so simple as it rst

appeared.

10

5. locality

let us assume that it is possible to infer the full at-space s-matrix from the conformal

eld theory correlators , through some variant of the above procedure or some other pro-

cedure. this would provide an even more concrete realization of the holographic proposal.

a profound question underlying this proposal is how it is possible for the boundary theory

to produce a bulk theory that is an approximately local theory in one higher dimension.

one piece of the answer appears to be that the boundary theory is a conformal eld

theory. in a conformal eld theory, there is no mass-shell condition on the states, since

there are no masses. correspondingly, one can have states with xed boundary momenta

and a spectrum (discrete in global coordinates, continuous in poincare coordinates) of

frequencies. this statement is made manifest in the kallen-lehman representation for

the boundary two-point function, which can be found from that of ads given in [16]. in

the bulk theory this spectrum is interpreted as arising from the dierent values of the

momentum in the extra radial direction.

thus, in this sense the boundary theory contains enough states to represent a bulk

theory. however, this is no guarantee that the interactions have the correct properties to

produce a sensible and approximately local bulk theory. one other key property is bulk

momentum conservation, which has been the subject of one recent discussion[17]. this

seems assured by the correspondence between the symmetries of the two theories: the

conformal group so(2, d) is also the group of isometries of anti-de sitter space, and in the

large-r limit reduces to the poincare group. however, this does not imply locality  there

is an innite variety of momentum conserving but nonlocal interactions.

one would like to investigate the possible presence of such nonlocality in the bulk

theory. of course, the bulk theory is not expected to be a local theory, but rather to have

nonlocalities present on a scale of order the string scale. but this is to be contrasted with

the situation where there are macroscopic nonlocalities, for example on scales of order the

(large) ads radius. one could imagine an observer living in an approximately minkowski

region in a very large ads space without ever knowing about the large-scale curvature,

and to such observers the only nonlocalities present should be very subtle and dicult to

measure eects not easily seen at long distances. such an ads observer shouldnt be able

to exploit macroscopic nonlocality to win the lottery! what property is it of the boundary

conformal theory that ensures preservation of locality at the macroscopic level? how does

one characterize the amount of nonlocality present? what experiments could be performed

11

to measure it? and is it sucient to resolve the black hole information paradox or solve

the cosmological constant problem? these are all questions of considerable importance.

as expected on grounds of both holography and gauge invariance, it appears that

one can at best compute the s-matrix of the bulk theory from full knowledge of the cft

correlators. therefore conventional tests of locality  like commutativity of eld operators

at spacelike separations  arent available. one must nd ways of diagnosing locality

directly from the s-matrix.

this is a dicult problem.7 first consider theories with a mass gap. here one test

of locality for the s-matrix is that it respect various bounds that can be derived as a

result of locality. amplitudes must satisfy both upper and lower bounds. for example, the

froissart bound [18] states that for four-point scattering at arbitrary angle, the amplitude

must obey

|a(s, )| < cs log2 s ,

(5.1)

where c is a constant; there are more stringent bounds for xed angle, 0 <  < .

polynomial boundedness also implies the cerulus-martin bound [19], which states that

amplitudes at arbitrary angles cant fall too rapidly at xed angle:

|a(s, )|  sc/s .

(5.2)

similar bounds have also been found in nonlocal theories. one way of producing a

nonlocal theory is to construct a theory with an exponentially increasing density of states,
such as string theory. this leads to the denition of quasi-localizable theories,8 which

are theories with nonlocality occurring below a denite length scale l. these theories are

characterized for example by densities of states that grow like

for some power , and satisfy bounds of the form

(m)  e(lm)

|a(s, )| < cs2 ln (s1/2) .

(5.3)

(5.4)

this suggests the possibility of reading o the scale of nonlocality from the behavior of

the four-point scattering amplitude.

7 i thank k. bardakci for several conversations on this issue.
8 for more discussion of these and their bounds, see [20] and references therein .

12

however, derivation of these bounds assumes the existence of a gap. the requisite an-

alyticity properties are spoiled by massless particles; gravity is particularly problematical.

here of course the usual ir divergences imply that one must study inclusive cross-sections,

summing over soft particles below some energy resolution relevant to the experiment in

question. nevertheless, one might hope that similar bounds could be derived for these
inclusive rates, providing a way of quantifying the degree of nonlocality of the theory.9

there are also estimates in high-energy string scattering[21,22] that should be con-

sidered as a standard of comparison. for example, [21] investigated the large s, xed t

regime; the borel resummation[23] of the resulting amplitudes yields an expression of the

form

valid in a domain

it would be very interesting to see whether the cft reproduces this and other stringy be-

havior. in fact, there are a number of open questions about the large order/nonperturbative

structure of high-energy string scattering, and one hope is that the boundary cft could

teach us something new about this.

so far the discussion has focussed on locality in the large s regime. however, its

not even a-priori clear how the ads/cft correspondence produces bulk locality at the

macroscopic level. wed like to nd appropriate criteria for this.

one possibility is to for example consider xed energy scattering of physical particles10

at large distances, or equivalently small t. one very rough criterion is that we have
interactions falling at least as fast as 1/rd2 at long distances, since the only long range
forces are expected to be gravity and other coulombic interactions. this corresponds to

scattering amplitudes that grow like 1/t as t decreases. in the ads context, one of course
expects this growth to be truncated at the ads radius, t  (1/r)2, but for r  1 there
is a clean separation of scales and one can study growth of amplitudes in the regime
1  t  (1/r)2 to see if they satisfy this crude criterion. indeed, taking this one step
further, one could also ask whether the boundary theory reproduces the correct structure

9 also, in ads the radius supplies an intrinsic ir cuto, which may be useful in circumventing

the usual ir problems.

10 these must in particular be neutral under any nonabelian gauge groups.

13

for gravitational (or other coulombic) scattering for a wide variety of semiclassical states.

this would be an important test, sensitive to bulk locality and more, of any independent

calculation of the cft correlators. it would be very interesting to go beyond to understand

what property of the boundary theory ensures recovery of the correct semiclassical limit.

one might inquire whether locality properties are encoded nicely in the operator

product expansion of the boundary theory. to investigate this, one rst needs a translation

of the kinematical variables  the mandelstam invariants  into the ads and cft contexts.

this is provided by considering the quadratic casimir of so(2,d), which in the large-r
limit reduces to the poincare invariant p 2 as shown in the appendix. thus if we wish to
combine two states in representations of so(2,d), the analog of s is now provided by the

conformal weight  of the resulting states in the product representation.

first consider the problem of large-s scattering. this for example should be governed

by fusion of two high energy states into a third state with large . the ope takes the

general form

i (x)j (y)  xk

cijk

k (y)

|x  y|i+jk

.

(5.7)

thus large k corresponds to very high order terms in the ope, rather than the leading
behavior. one can see a similar eect by considering scattering of two particles with
momenta e(1, e1) and e(1, e2). for these, s = e2(1  e1  e2). in the ope limit, e1  e2,
s  e22 where  is the angle between the unit vectors. small boundary distance only
corresponds to large s if we simultaneously take very large e.

however, this suggests that behavior of amplitudes at t  0 could be explored in the
ope limit in the t channel. i hope to return to the implications for cft in future work.

finally, related to this discussion is the question of whether one can reconstruct the

entire bulk theory given complete data in the boundary theory. in general reconstruction

of a theory given the s-matrix is not unique, but one may try to reconstruct even one

bulk theory that reproduces the correct amplitudes. consider rst three-point functions.

a problem here is that the cft three-point function is uniquely determined by conformal

symmetry, up to a constant; in the example of scalars, both interactions

g1z dv 3

and g2z dv 22

(5.8)

give identical three-point functions up to this constant [13]. of course the dependence of

this constant on r for the two dierent cases will be dierent; this will help in decoding

the dierent interactions. but in general the program will involve considering four- and

higher-point functions, with their non-trivial dynamics. the problem of reconstruction is

an interesting one for the future.

6. conclusion

this paper has attempted a modest beginning of an investigation of bulk locality in the

ads-cft correspondence. a rst problem is to extract the at space s-matrix from the

boundary correlators. ideas for how to do this have been previously presented in [7,8,5,6],

but there are subtleties. in particular, it was showed that at arbitrary non-normalizable

frequencies, the boundary correlators are sensitive to interactions in the skin of ads, at

radii r > r, due to growth of the wavefunctions and of the volume of anti-de sitter space.

it appears that only by a delicate procedure of extracting the residues of poles at the

normalizable frequencies may we nd the at s-matrix. there are bound to be wrinkles in

this procedure when all-order perturbative or non-perturbative amplitudes are considered.

wed like to know what form locality takes in the bulk theory. there is no known

procedure to extract o-shell data about this theory  in accord with holography as well as

gauge invariance  and so information about locality properties must be derived directly

from the s-matrix.

in theories with a gap, locality or even nonlocality on a denite

scale implies certain bounds for the s-matrix, but the presence of massless particles and

particularly gravity complicates the story. nonetheless, some information is known about

the behavior of high-energy string scattering amplitudes, and one might as a rst test

try to investigate this behavior from the cft and even to go beyond to new results.

furthermore, the bulk theory should exhibit macroscopic locality, namely bulk observers

should nd an approximately local theory at long distances. one very rough criterion for

this is fallo of potentials (thus growth of amplitudes) bounded by coulomb behavior.

indeed, another important test is reproduction of semiclassical gravitational scattering.

wed like to know whether the cft reproduces such behavior, and in particular what

properties of the boundary theory allow the surprising result that an approximately local

higher-dimensional theory emerges from it.

appendix a. basic ads tools

this appendix will review some basic properties of the geometry of anti-de sitter space

and its boundary, and of wavefunctions and propagators on ads, as well as deriving some

new and useful results. in particular, an explicit treatment of the large r limit will be

given.

a.1. geometry

adsd+1 can be represented as the solution of the equation

(x m )2 = r2

(a.1)

in at (2, d) signature minkowski space with coordinates (x1, x 0, x i) and with metric

ds2 = m n dx m dx n = (dx1)2  (dx 0)2 + (dx i)2 .

(a.2)

global coordinates (, , e), where e is a d-dimensional unit vector, are dened by

x1 = r

cos 
cos 

, x 0 = r

sin 
cos 

, x i = r tan ei ,

(a.3)

and in these coordinates the metric takes the form

ds2 =

r2

cos2 

(d 2 + d2 + sin2  d2

d1) .

(a.4)

typically we will work on the universal cover of anti-de sitter space, which in an abuse of
notation will also be denoted adsd+1. the r  sd1 boundary of this cover corresponds
to  = /2 and is parameterized as b = (, e).

there are two related notions of invariant distance on adsd+1. the rst is geodetic

distance, dened with respect to the embedding space metric:

(x1, x2) =

1
2

m n x m x n ;

(a.5)

in global coordinates it can be shown that

(x1, x2) = r2 +

r2

cos 1 cos 2

[cos(1  2)  sin 1 sin 2e1  e2] .

(a.6)

the second is geodesic distance, as measured in the ads metric (a.4). this can be shown

to be given by

s(x1, x2) = r cosh1(cid:20) cos(1  2)  sin 1 sin 2e1  e2

cos 1 cos 2

(cid:21)

(a.7)

16

in global coordinates. geodesic and geodetic distances are related by

cosh(cid:16) s

r(cid:17) = 1 +


r2 .

(a.8)

there is of course no conformally-invariant notion of interval on the boundary. when

working in poincare coordinates for adsd+1

ds2 = r2(cid:18) du 2

u 2 + u 2dx2(cid:19) ,

where

u =

x1  x d

r

; x = x /ru ,  = 0, 1,    d  1 ,

one frequently uses the non-conformally invariant interval x2

12 = |x1  x2|2.

coordinates this becomes

thus the denition

x2
12 =

2(cos(1  2)  e1  e2)
(cos 1  ed
1)(cos 2  ed
2)

;

s2
12 = cos(1  2)  e1  e2

(a.9)

(a.10)

in global

(a.11)

(a.12)

gives an analogous non-conformally invariant interval in the global frame. in order to form

conformal invariants, one must have four or more points, allowing the denition of cross

ratios like

s2
12s2
34
s2
13s2
24

=

(cos(1  2)  e1  e2)(cos(3  4)  e3  e4)
(cos(1  3)  e1  e3)(cos(2  4)  e2  e4)

.

(a.13)

a.2. wavefunctions

in many respects anti-de sitter space behaves like a resonant cavity. in particular,

solutions of the scalar wave equation

are for generic frequencies non-normalizable, having asymptotic behavior

(  m2) = 0

where

  (cos )2h ,

4h = d pd2  4m2r2 = d  2 ,

17

(a.14)

(a.15)

(a.16)

near the boundary at  = /2.

only for special frequencies,

nl = 2h+ + 2n + l

(a.17)

do normalizable solutions exist. explicit forms for these solutions are given in [14,11],

nl ~m(~x,  ) = nl()yl ~m(e)

einl
2nl

(a.18)

where the radial wavefunctions nl() are written in terms of the jacobi polynomials,11

nl() = anl(cos )2h+(sin )lp l+d/21,

n

(cos 2) .

(a.19)

here anl is a normalization constant. if the nl ~m are given the conventional klein-gordon

normalization

(nl ~m, nl ~m) = z dnl ~mi nl ~m = nn ll  ~m ~m

with respect to surfaces of constant  , then these constants are

anl

2 =

2nl
rd1

n!(n + 2h+ + l)

(n + l + d

2 )(n +  + 1)

.

the normalizable solutions have asymptotic behavior given by

with constants knl given by

nl()

/2
 knl(cos )2h+ ,

knl = (1)nanl

(n +  + 1)
n!( + 1)

.

a.3. green functions

the bulk feynman green function is dened by solving

(  m2)ikb(x, x) = (x, x)

11 the conventions of [24] will be followed.

18

(a.20)

(a.21)

(a.22)

with feynman boundary conditions.

it can be represented as an innite sum over the

normalizable modes,

ikb(x, x) = z d

2 xnl ~m

ei( ) nl ~m(~x)nl ~m(~x)
2  2  i

nl

.

(a.25)

the sum has been explicitly performed to yield[14,15]

ikb(x, x) =

cb

[cosh2(s/r) + i]h+

f (cid:18)h+, h+ +

1
2

;  + 1;

1

cosh2(s/r)  i(cid:19) ,

(a.26)

where cb is a constant,

cb =

1

(2h+)

rd1

22h++1d/2( + 1)

,

(a.27)

and f is the hypergeometric function.

the bulk-boundary propagator kb is designed to provide a solution to the free wave

equation (a.14) satisfying the boundary condition

this solution is given by



/2
 (cos )2hf (b) .

(x) = z dbf (b)kb(b, x) .

a simple greens theorem-type argument[6] shows that

kb(b, x) = 2rd1 lim
/2

(cos )2h+ikb(x, x) .

(a.28)

(a.29)

(a.30)

we can therefore nd two equivalent expressions for kb, the rst from the limit of (a.25),

kb(b, x) = 2rd1z d

2 xnl ~m

ei( ) knly l ~m(e)nl ~m(~x)
2  2  i

nl

,

and the second from the limit of (a.26),

kb(b, x) = cb (cid:20)

cos2 

[cos(  )  sin e  e]2 + i(cid:21)h+

,

where

cb =

(2h+)

22h+d/2()

.

19

(a.31)

(a.32)

(a.33)

finally, the boundary two-point function can be obtained by taking the second point

to the boundary,

this gives

g(b, b)  lim

k(b, b) = k z d

(a.34)

(a.35)

1

([cos(  )  e  e]2 + i)h+

,

(a.36)

where k and c are constants. note that k is naturally written in terms of the boundary

interval (a.12).

a.4. large-r limits

it was shown in sec. 3 that for large r, in a patch of proper size o(r), anti-de
sitter space may be approximated by minkowski space. this can be explicitly seen in the

coordinates

t = r ; r = r ,

where the metric takes the form

ds2 =

1

cos2(r/r) hdt2 + dr2 + r2 sin2(

r
r

)2d2i .

(a.37)

(a.38)

this subsection will discuss other aspects of the relationship between adsd+1and md+1 at

large r.

first consider the relation between the symmetry generators jm n of so(2, d) and

those of the poincare group. in the vicinity of (, ) = (0, 0), the connection can be made

through the identication

p =

j1
r

, m = j ;

(a.39)

the so(2, d) algebra clearly goes over to the poincare algebra in the limit r  . also
useful is the quadratic casimir, which is important for the classication of the representa-

tions of the conformal group. it is given by

c2 =

1
2

jm n j m n =

1
2

mm   r2pp 

(a.40)

20

and takes value c2 = (d  ) in a representation of conformal weight . from the
relationship  = 2h+ and eq. (a.16), we see that

c2 = m2r2 ,

(a.41)

which combined with (a.40) gives the correct mass-shell relation in the large-r limit. the

quadratic casimir may be used to nd analogues of the mandelstam invariants.

next consider wavefunctions. the relations (4.2), (a.17) imply that

er = 2h+ + 2n + l ,

(a.42)

so for xed minkowski energy and angular momentum, and m<o(1/r), large r corre-

sponds to large n. a useful relation for large order jacobi polynomials is

lim
n

for r  r this gives

1
n p 

n (cos(x/n)) = (cid:18) 2

x(cid:19)

j(x) .

(a.43)

lim
r

cos2h+(r/r) sinl(r/r)p (l+d/21,)

n

(cos(2r/r))

= (er)d/21

1

(er)d/21 jl+d/21(er) ,

(a.44)

which is, up to the overall power of er, the standard at space radial wavefunction. we

also need anl, which from (a.21) via sterlings approximation is

anl r r 2nl
rd1 .

combining this with (a.44) then gives the desired wavefunctions at large-r:

nl ~m(~x) r 2ed1

1

(er)d/21 jl+d/21(er)yl ~m(e) ,

(a.45)

(a.46)

where r  r is understood. at   /2, corresponding to large r, one still nds behavior
 (cos )2h+, and in fact the large-r limit of the coecients knl of eq. (a.22) is

knl r

(1)n
( + 1)

2e
2 (cid:19)
rd/21 (cid:18) er

.

(a.47)

finally consider the large-r behavior of the green functions. the asymptotics of the

bulk propagator immediately follows from (a.26). geodesic distance on adsd+1 trivially

21

becomes the minkowski interval. the hypergeometric function must therefore be evaluated

with argument near one, which is done via the formula

f (h+, h+ +

( + 1)( 1d

+ (1  z)(1d)/2 ( + 1)( d1

(1  h)( 1
2 )
(h+)(h+ + 1
2 )

2  h)
f (1  h,

taking

1

z =

cosh2(s/r)  1 
and assuming that  stays nite as r  , we nd
c

(a.49)

(a.50)

(a.51)

[s2(x, x) + i](d1)/2 ,

where

c =

( d1

2 )(2h+)

d/222h++1(h+)(h+ + 1
2 )

.

this is the expected massless at-space propagator.

as we saw in sec. 4, for generic frequencies the bulk-boundary propagator kb grows
like (cos )2h at the boundary, and so in the large-r limit is not concentrated in the

minkowski region. this can be remedied by restricting to normalizable frequencies, as in
eq. (4.12). the large-r behavior of the resulting function k is readily inferred from (a.46)
and (a.47), and gives

k(n, l, ~m, x) r c(e, r)(1)l/2

1

(er)d/21 jl+d/21(er)y l ~m(e)

where the coecient function c(e, r) is given by

c(e, r) =

(1)er/2h+(er)2h+ .
