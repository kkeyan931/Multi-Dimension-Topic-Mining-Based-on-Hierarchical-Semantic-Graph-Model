abstract

following a recent suggestion by randall and sundrum, we consider string compactication
scenarios in which a compact slice of ads-space arises as a subspace of the compactica-
tion manifold. a specic example is provided by the type ii orientifold equivalent to type
i theory on (orbifolds of) t 6, upon taking into account the gravitational backreaction of
the d3-branes localized inside the t 6. the conformal factor of the four-dimensional metric
depends exponentially on one of the compact directions, which, via the holographic corre-
spondence, becomes identied with the renormalization group scale in the uncompactied
world. this set-up can be viewed as a generalization of the ads/cft correspondence to
boundary theories that include gravitational dynamics. a striking consequence is that, in
this scenario, the fundamental planck size string and the large n qcd string appear as (two
dierent wavefunctions of) one and the same object.

1

introduction

in string theory, when considered as a framework for unifying gravity and quantum mechan-
ics, the fundamental strings are naturally thought of as planck size objects. at much lower
energies, such as the typical weak or strong interaction scales, the strings have lost all their
internal structure and behave just as ordinary point-particles. the physics in this regime
is therefore accurately described in terms of ordinary local quantum eld theory, decoupled
from the planckian realm of all string and quantum gravitational physics. the existence of
this large separation of scales has often been used as an argument against the potential pre-
dictive power or even the potential reality of string theory. however, as we will argue in this
letter, there are a number of recent insights and ideas that suggest a rather more optimistic
scenario, in which string physics may have visible consequences at much lower energies scales
than assumed thus far. the two particular recent developments that we wish to combine are:

(i) the ads/cft correspondence

the basic example here is the proposed duality between four-dimensional n =4 sym

theory and type ii b string theory on ads5  s5 geometry

here ds 2

4 = dx2

//

ds2 = e2y/r ds 2

denotes the at four-dimensional metric and

r2 = q4ngs

(1)

(2)

with gs = g2
ym the type iib string coupling [1] [2]. in this ads/cft dictionary, the coordinate
y needs to be thought of as parametrizing the four-dimensional scale: two sym excitations
related by a scale transformation

translate on the ads-side into two excitations concentrated around dierent locations in the
y-direction related by a translation

x//  ex//

(3)

y  y + r.

(4)

this map thus provides a holographic projection of the physics of the gauge theory (which
can be thought of as living on the ads-boundary) onto the one higher-dimensional ads
space.

truncating the ads theory to y-values larger (or smaller) than some nite value y = y0
amounts to introducing an uv (or ir) cut-o in the gauge theory [3]. in the strict continuum
limit, however, the range of y-values extends over the full real axis. a consequence of this is
that, while the type ii theory on the ads-space contains gravity, the dual conformal gauge
theory on the boundary does not. modes of the ads gravitational eld that extend all the
way to the boundary y   are not normalizable, and therefore do not uctuate.

1

the metric ds2 has the rather striking property that for suciently large y-values it
diers from the four-dimensional brane-metric ds 2
4 by an exponentially large red-shift factor
e2y/r , that is, distances along the x// -directions are measured very dierently by both
metrics. a most dramatic consequence of this that the fundamental iib strings, while
still of planck size when viewed by the full metric ds2, can become arbitrarily large when
measured in terms world-brane metric ds 2
4, simply by moving to larger y values. the sym
interpretation of these large iib strings is that they represent the color-electric ux lines [2].
in principle this type of holographic correspondence can be generalized to less symmetric
gauge theories with non-zero beta-functions and more complicated phase diagrams. the
idea remains the same, namely that y-translations in eect amount to renormalization group
transformations on the gauge theory side. beta-functions or symmetry breaking or other type
of phase transitions thus translate into a non-trivial y-dependence (e.g.
in the form of do-
main wall structures) of the metric, dilaton and other elds relative to the ads5-background.

(ii) compactifications with a d3-brane world

in a large class of type i string compactications, the gauge theory degrees of freedom
in our four-dimensional world may be thought of as bound to a (collection of) d3-brane(s).
these 3-branes wrap our world but are otherwise localized as point-like objects somewhere
inside the compactication manifold. scenarios of this type have recently been studied from
various points of view, as in particular they seem to oer some promising new avenues for
addressing the gauge hierarchy problem [4, 5]. besides (perhaps) allowing for the possibility
of large extra dimensions [4], a second new aspect of these type of compactications is that
(due to the backreaction of the d3-branes) various elds, such as the dilaton and in particular
the conformal factor of the four-dimensional metric, may acquire non-trivial dependence on
the compact coordinates.

an interesting example of this type of geometry was recently considered by randall and
sundrum in [5]. in this set-up, the four-dimensional conformal factor is found to depend
exponentially on the extra fth coordinate y, precisely as in the ads-geometry (1). a
new ingredient, relative to the standard ads situation, is that in [5] the extra coordinate
y is chosen to run over a nite (or semi-innite) range. as a consequence, there exists a
normalizable gravitational collective mode, given by those uctuations of the metric ds2 that
preserve the form (1) but with ds 2
4 replaced by a (suciently slowly varying but otherwise)
general four-dimensional metric

ds 2

4 = g (4)

 (x//)dx

dx

//

.

(5)

//

hence this collective mode behaves just as the ordinary graviton of our four-dimensional
world. in addition, due to the exponential y-behavior of the graviton wave-function, a given
object with ve-dimensional mass m has an eective four-dimensional mass m4, that depends
of its y-location via

m4(y) = mey/r

2

(6)

in [5] the presence of this exponential red-shift factor (or warp factor) was argued to
provide a natural explanation of the large mass hierarchies, such as between the weak and
planck scale.

putting (i) and (ii) together:
it seems natural to look for a way of combining these two ideas. concretely, one could ask
the following two (probably equivalent) questions:

 can the ads/cft type of dualities be extended to situations where the radial ads-
coordinate is eectively compactied, and does this compactiation indeed automati-
cally imply the presence of four-dimensional gravity on the boundary?

 are there string compactication scenarios where a compact slice of ads-space appears
as part of the compactication geometry, and does the radial ads coordinate then
again have a holographic interpretation as parametrizing the rg scale of the four-
dimensional theory?

in the following we will argue that both questions have a positive answer, though the rst
one only for a (large but) nite set of d3-brane charges n. consequently, the compactied
ads-geometry will be a good approximation provided the string coupling gs is not too small
compared to 1/n. in the concluding section we will address some of the possible consequences
of this new view on string compactication.

2 ads compactication

let us start with considering the toy example of a four-dimensional n =4 supersymmetric
world described by the t 6 compactication of the type i superstring. its low energy eective
description is given by n =4 super-yang-mills theory, with as maximal unbroken gauge
symmetry group g = so(32), coupled to supergravity. in the following we will consider the
situation where this symmetry is broken down to an u(n) sub-group with n  16.
by applying t -duality this type i string theory can be equivalently described as an
orientifold of type ii string theory on t 6. in this representation, there are 26 = 64 orientifold
planes located at all the half-way points of the t 6. in addition, there are 32 d3-branes inside
the t 6 which are pairwise identied under the orientifold z2-action [7]. hence it is possible
for n  16 of these d3-branes to form a small cluster inside the t 6, and in the limit where
all n coincide at the same point, the unbroken u(n) gauge symmetry appears.
at low energies in the uncompactied world, gravity eectively decouples from the u(n)
sym dynamics. thus we can look for a regime of parameters in which we can apply the
ads/cft duality map and obtain type ii theory on ads5  s5 as a good dual low energy
description. the main restriction (in order to be able to trust the sigma-model approxima-
tion) is that the ads5 radius of curvature r, given in (2), needs to be large compared to the

hence, relative to the usual large n context, we now have a somewhat more limited control
over the approximations involved in the duality map.

around the string scale ls, open string eects will start to modify the sym dynamics.
let us choose the radial ads-coordinate y such that this string scale ls gets mapped to
the region around y  0. then the ads5  s5-description is a valid approximation for the
low-energy regime y >> r. around y  0, on the other hand, we reach the transition region
where the low energy regime meets with the high energy regime described by orientifold of
type ii on t 6. our main new proposal is that these two regimes can be consistently glued
together into one single dual type ii string background. in the following we will assume that
the size of the t 6 is bigger or of the order of the ads-radius r in (2).

as a rst approximation, we can visualize the total target space of this new type ii theory
as follows. we rst cut out a small ball around the d3-branes inside the t 6, such that its
outside radius coincides with the s5 radius r in (2). then we replace the inside of the ball by
the y > 0 region of ads5  s5. (see g. 1). it seems reasonable to assume that the resulting

4

total space can be smoothed out to obtain an exact consistent type ii background, and the
end result of this procedure should be equivalent to taking into account the gravitational
backreaction of the d3-branes.

in a more complete treatment, we must also include the backreaction of the 64 orientifold
planes. these have a negative tension equal to 1/4 times the d3-brane tension, which need
to be taken into account. we can write an explicit form for the background metric, by starting
from the general form

ds2 =

h(x)1/2

ds 2

4 + h(x)1/2 dx2
.

//

4 = dx2

with ds 2
, and where x denote the coordinates inside the t 6. for simplicity, let us
consider the most symmetric example of the so(32) invariant point, where all 16 d3-branes
coincide with their 16 z2 images at one of the orientifold xed points, say at x = 0. taking
the t 6 to be an exact cube with period rc, the harmonic function h(x) then takes the
form

where

h(x) = 1 + 4gs()2hfd(x)  fo(x)i

that of the 64 orientifold planes located at all the half-way points inside the t 6. in the region
close to the d3-branes at x = 0, the above geometry indeed reduces to the ads5s5 metric
(1).1
the present minimal example (of the simple t 6 orientifold compactication) can straight-
forwardly be generalized to less symmetric theories obtained e.g. by applying further orb-
ifoldings. in this way one can nd holographic duals to a large class of four-dimensional type
i string theories, typically with a reduced number of (or even zero) supersymmetries. the
total target space of the type ii duals should all describe consistent compactications of the
ads5 s5 geometry. the number of such consistent ads-compactications, however, is con-
strained by the usual tadpole cancelation conditions. in particular, one needs to make sure
that the rr ux n that escapes the ads-region gets absorbed by the appropriate number

to this condition can be found only for a nite set of n-values. still, relative to our minimal
set-up, one can signicantly extend the range of allowed values for n, up to values of the
order of n  103 or larger, by considering more general orbifold spaces. hence in this more
general setting, the restriction (7) in eect just amounts to gs >> 104, which leaves a quite
sucient parameter range for which we can trust our approximations.

3 gravitational coupling

this geometric set-up is now indeed very similar to that of [5], where our t 6 region with the
orientifold planes plays the role as the positive tension brane in their scenario. several of the
same conclusions apply. in particular, we must nd a collective graviton mode of the exact
same type as described in the introduction, that couples precisely as the four-dimensional
graviton to the boundary eld theory. in our case this result was of course expected from
the start, since the boundary theory is in fact the type i string theory on t 6  r4, that also
contains a gravitational closed string sector.
the relation between the four-dimensional planck length lpl and the 10-dimensional one

l10 takes the usual form

(l10)8 = (lpl)2 v6

(12)

where v6 is the appropriately measured volume of the t 6. plugging the form (8) into the
ten-dimensional action gives

1

(l10)8 z d10xg10 r10 =

v6

(l10)8 z d4x// g4r4

with

v6 = zt 6

d6x h(x).

(13)

(14)

notice that, in spite of the fourth order pole in h(x) near the branes, this integral indeed
yields a nite answer.

the collective mode of the 10-dimensional metric that produces the four-dimensional
graviton again has the same shape as the full metric, as given in eqn (8), with ds2
4 a general
four-metric (though suciently slowly varying with x//). the shape of the graviton wave-
function the ads-region decays with y as e2y/r. this exponential factor is reects the
fact that the coupling of matter to the graviton becomes weaker and weaker at lower and
lower scales. indeed, we can extract the strength of the coupling to matter by inserting the
variation g(4)
4 into the the ten-metric (8). the corresponding
variation of the 10-d matter action reads

 = h of the four-metric ds2

z d10xg10 g

10 t = z d4x// h t 

(15)

6

with

t (x//) = z d6x h(x) t.

(16)

inserting on the right-hand side the energy-momentum tensor (here all indices contracted
with the ten-metric ds2)

t =

m

g10

z d

x x x2

10(xx( ))

(17)

of a 10-d point-particle, with mass m located at a given location y, gives for the eective
4-d energy-momentum tensor (with all indices contracted with the four-metric ds2
4)

t  =

m

h(x)1/4 z d

x x x2

4(x//x//( ))

so the four-dimensional mass depends on x as

m4(x) =

m

h(x)1/4 .

(18)

(19)

this is the expected red-shift eect; close to the d3 branes it reduces to (6).

4 rg scale as a real extra dimension

though familiar and standard, the appearance of both open and closed string dynamics
in type i string theory is still a deep fact. the two are indeed intertwined in an intricate
way, since when one starts including the open string quantum eects, there is no obviously
unique way of separating the open string loop diagrams from closed string tadpoles. this
very subtlety of course lies at the heart of the d-brane correspondence between gauge theory
and gravity. a microscopic reconstruction of the reasoning of [1] indeed shows that the
appearance of the curved ads-metric (1), as describing the near-horizon region close to the
d3-branes, must be thought of as a cumulative consequence of open string quantum eects.
concretely, one can imagine setting up a renormalization group ow, where via a fischler-
susskind type mechanism, the eect of integrating out successive momentum shells in the
open string channel gets absorbed into an appropriate redenition of the world-sheet sigma-
model couplings. roughly speaking, in this procedure the slice of the ads target space in
between two values y1 and y2 gets created from the open string dynamics in between the
corresponding energy scales. eventually, after all open strings are integrated out, its planar
diagrams have been replaced by a stretched-out closed string worldsheet, moving inside the
semi-innite ads-throat geometry. thus, in a quite precise sense, the ads closed strings
provide the long sought after dual representation of the gauge theory planar graphs [1] [2].

7

if instead one runs this renormalization group ow from the string scale down to a
certain nite length scale l (for example the weak scale), the resulting target space consists
of a compact slice of ads bounded by the planck region y  0 on one side and by an
eective d3-brane located at y  r log l/ls on the other. the d3-brane hosts the remaining
sector of low energy open strings2, describing the physics at distance scales larger than l.
sub-planckian physics thus happens far inside the ads-tube, and from this perspective the
t 6-orientifold region merely acts as a kind of sounding board, providing some appropriate
boundary condition in the far away planckian regime. via high energy experiments on the
d3-brane world-volume, however, one can still generate quantum uctuations that extend
to smaller values of y and thereby probe the corresponding planckian geometry.

what new lesson can we extract from this? it is clear that, relative to the standard notion
of an extra dimension, the y-direction is rather unusual. normally one would expect that
space-like separated events are independent, while here we are learning that y-translations
are in eect scale transformations. therefore, to avoid over-counting of the number of degrees
of freedom, we thus indeed need to adopt the hypothesis that physics that happens far out
in the y-direction is not really independent from that, say, at the boundary region y  0,
but rather a holographic image of physics at y  0 happening at a corresponding scale
l(y) = lsey/r.3 this is the familiar dictionary of the ads/cft correspondence [9][10].
though quite miraculous, in itself this holographic equivalence doesnt teach us anything
new yet, as it simply points to some redundance in the description. we could for example
insist on describing all the physics as happening just at y  0, and consider the holographic
map as some purely mathematical equivalence. relative to the standard ads/cft situation,
however, we now have four-dimensional gravity as an essential new ingredient.
in rst
approximation the gravity coupling seems quite consistent with holography, since (as seen
from the previous section) it looks like to a relatively standard kaluza-klein dimensional
reduction. the holographic reconstruction does, however, strictly amount to a non-trivial
redistribution of matter, and since gravity is still in the game, in the end we do need to
specify which energy-momentum distribution acts as a source for the gravitational eld.

the new consequence of this holographic view of gravity, therefore, is that the renormal-
ization group scale is promoted to a real physical extra direction. concretely, this means
that for type i string theory the gravitational energy-momentum in our four-dimensional
world really spreads out into the extra y-direction, indeed similar to a holographic, or in a
perhaps more accurate analogy, chromatographic image.

brane is no longer applicable in our context. also the (continuum) kk tower of gravitational excitations
must be reinterpreted as actually representing low energy sym degrees freedom in the boundary theory.

8

5 concluding remarks

finally, let us try to draw a few obvious and less obvious conclusions. we begin with

the planck vs large n qcd string

a rst striking property of this new scenario is that the planckian type ii string and the
low energy electric ux strings are in essence made up from one and the same object: the two
are simply related by a translation in the y-direction. similarly, in more realistic type i com-
pactications with qcd-like conning gauge sectors, one expects to nd glueball excitations
that on the type ii side correspond to bound state solutions to the graviton wave-equation,
localized (possibly around some domain wall structure) far inside the ads-region. this is
just like in the standard ads/cft correspondence. however, the new ingredient here is
that the bulk gravity (used for representing the glueballs) and the gravity in the physical
boundary world are directly linked and produced by the same type ii string.

low energy string phenomenology

the above set-up seems to open up the possibility of nding type ii string compactica-
tion scenarios that in eect bypass the quark and gluon stage and immediately connect with
the infra-red degrees of freedom in terms of mesons, baryons, etc. more generally, instead
of the usual top-down approach to string phenomenology, one may contemplate a rather
dierent bottom-up philosophy. ideally, one could rst try to connect string theory with
low-energy physics (e.g. via standard non-compact ads/cft type technology and variations
thereof) and then afterwards introduce gravity by trying to look for all possible consistent
compactications of this ads-type space. of course, there are still important technical as
well as conceptual obstacles to deal with, such as supersymmetry breaking, unication, mass-
less moduli elds, and allowing n to be small rather than large, just to name a few.

the gauge hierarchy problem

perhaps the deepest consequence of the above picture is that the renormalization group
scale parameter of the four-dimensional world gets promoted to a real physical extra dimen-
sion. in this way all relative mass hierarchies, such as those between the weak scale and
the planck scale, are translated into relative separations in this extra direction. since the
conformal factor decays exponentially with y with a planckian decay length, separations of
say 50 or 100 times the planck length generate scale factors as large as 1015 or 1030 [5]. while
perhaps one could argue that this gives a natural explanation of the large mass separations
in our world, without giving a good reason of why string theory would necessarily choose this
type of compactication geometry, one cannot claim it really solves the hierarchy problem.
instead, it seems more sensible to turn the conclusion around, and consider the existence of
a large mass hierarchy as evidence supporting this type of compactication scenario as its
most natural geometric realization.

9

the cosmological constant problem

the most vexing hierarchy problem is of course that of the cosmological constant. in
essence it arises as a clash between experiment and the theoretical knowledge of general
relativity and the renormalization group. there are several ingredients in the present set-up,
however, such as (i) the reinterpretation of the rg scale as a holographic extra dimension,
(ii) the intimate connection between the rg ow and the ads-gravity equations of motion,
(iii) the presence of a planckian size negative cosmological constant inside the ads-region,
that suggest a rather new perspective on this problem.

in this connection, it seems interesting to note that a naive ads holographic description
of the universe (as a boundary theory with nite temperature equal to that of the microwave
background) identies the total geometry with that of an ads black hole [11] with a horizon
radius of about a millimeter, and thus with associated entropy of the order of 1090. a sugges-
tive coincidence is that this horizon size is of similar magnitude as the thermal wavelength
of the radiation itself, which perhaps indicates that holography may provide a link between
the size and the total entropy of the universe [12].

finally, we notice that this view of the universe as an ads black hole has the striking
consequence that any pair of points can be connected via a path of at most a couple of mil-
limeter length. indeed, one can simply rst travel close to the black hole horizon, traverse the
required distance in the x//-direction, and then go back. this does not mean, however, that
one can travel at super-luminous speeds, since the travel time (as measured in our world) is
delayed correspondingly by the red-shift factor.
