abstract

the cosmic holographic principle suggested by fischler and susskind has been exam-

ined in (2+1)-dimensional cosmological models. analogously to the (3+1)-dimensional

counterpart, the holographic principle is satised in all at and open universes. for

(2+1)-dimensional closed universes the holographic principle cannot be realized in gen-

eral. the principle cannot be maintained, neither introducing negative pressure matter

nor matter with highly unconventional equation of state.

it is well-known that the entropy of a black hole is represented in terms of the area a of

the event horizon by the formula s = a/4. this relation can be interpreted as meaning that

all the degrees of freedom in a black hole are stored on its boundary. for a long time one

has sought to extend this relation to more general situations in gravity, meaning that under

certain conditions all the information contained in a physical system in quantum gravity can

be projected onto its boundary. this is called the holographic principle [1, 2]. recently this

hope has been further promoted by the discovery of ads/cft (anti-de sitter/conformal

field theory) correspondence [3]. the conjectured equivalence between supergravity on d-

dimensional ads space and conformal eld theory on d-1-dimensional boundary has been

proved very useful to gain information about supergravity in the bulk from knowledge about

its boundary. it is generally believed that the holographic principle must eventually have

implications for cosmology.

there have been many attempts to apply dierent formulations of the holographic prin-

ciple to various cosmological models [4][12]. a specic realization was suggested by fischler

and susskind [4]. a remarkable point of their proposal is that the holographic principle is
valid for at or open universes with the equation of state satisfying the condition 0  p  .
however, for the closed universe the principle is violated. the problem becomes even more

serious if one investigates the universe with a negative cosmological constant [5]. in that

case the holographic principle fails, independently of whether the universe is closed, open or

at. various dierent modications of fischler and susskinds version of holographic princi-

ple have been raised recently, such as replacing the holographic principle by the generalized

second law of thermodynamics [6, 5], using cosmological apparent horizon instead of particle

horizon in the formulation of holographic principle [7], changing the denition of degrees

of freedom [8] etc. a very recent result claimed that the holographic principle in a closed

universe can be obeyed if the universe contains strange negative pressure matter [12]. all

these studies have concentrated on (3+1)-dimensional cosmology and it would be fair to say

that the fully understanding of the cosmic holography is still lacking.

the purpose of the present paper is to reconsider the previous studies in (2+1)-dimensional

cosmological models, where the mathematical simplicity may help us understanding the

physics deeper. the fact that the rst successful implication of ads/cft duality to solve

the problem of the microscopic interpretation of black hole entropy appeared in (2+1)-

dimensional models [13-16], giving more hints in that of higher-dimensional black hole cases

2

[17-19], gives us further motivation to study (2+1)-dimensional cosmological models. we

will try to examine the basic assumptions of cosmic holography and show that for open and

at universes with a certain xed equation of state, the result in (2+1)-dimensional cases

reproduces that of (3+1)-dimensional cosmology [4-6]. applying the method proposed in

[5], we nd that the holographic principle in (2+1)-dimensional closed universes containing

normal matter of positive pressure cannot be realized. attempts to protect the holographic

principle by introducing negative pressure matter as well as matter with highly unconven-

tional state equation also has been foiled.

we rst consider the equations governing homogeneous expansion in (2+1)-dimensions

[20]. in terms of the (2+1)-dimensional robertson-walker line element

ds2 = dt2  a2(t)(

dr2

1  kr2 + r2d2),

einstein eld equations become

(

(a2) + p

d

k
a2 = 2g,
a
a
a2 = 0.

= 2gp,

for a dust-lled universe, p = 0 and energy-momentum conservation leads to

a2 = const = 0a2
0
a2 = 2gm0  k

where m0 = 0a2

0. eq(6) requires m0  k/2g, therefore the solution

a(t) = a0 +p2gm0  kt

implies that the universe will always expand, regardless of the value of k.

the comoving distance to the horizon rh is dened by

rh = z t

0

dt
a(t)

=

2gm0  k

(8)

while the corresponding physical distance is lh = a(t)rh . the total entropy inside the

horizon divided by the area grows as

s
a

= 

rh
a

where  is the comoving entropy density and stises   a2
as the universe expands, the bound will be satised even better. this result is in agreement

0 at the beginning. thus, later on,

with the case of the at and open universes discussed in (3+1)-dimensional cases [4-6].

let us consider now a radiation-dominated universe [20], namely  = 2p . energy-

momentum conservation now implies that

a3 = const = 0a3
0,
a2 = 2gm0/a  k,
a = m0g/a2.

in the at case (k = 0), the solution of (11) is straightforward

the comoving horizon is

a(t) = [

3
2

(2gm0)1/2]2/3t2/3.

rh = z t

a(t)

=

for large t, the comoving entropy area relation behaves as

s
a

straint was satised at the beginning, namely, /a2

thus the ratio s/a does not increase with time. therefore if the initial holographic con-
0  1, as the universe expands the holo-
graphic bound will get more stringent, which agrees with the (3+1)-dimensional results

[4-6].

the behavior of isotropic open universe (k = 1) is similar to that of the at universe.
it is of interest to discuss the closed universe model (k = 1) in the radiation-dominated

phase. first of all, we see from eq(11) that a vanishes at a = 2gm0, after which a becomes

negative and universe collapses. this happens within a nite time after the beginning of

the expansion. from the denition of the particle horizon and (11), one can nd the value

of lh at the turning point,

lh(turning) = 2gm0b(1/2, 1/2),

(16)

where b(p, q) is the euler beta function. putting these formulas together, we see that at

the turning point

s
a 

1

4gm0

.

4

(17)

the ratio s/a is seen to be smaller than unit at the turning point. now we can consider

what happens near the nal stages of collapse, when the universe has evolved back to the
lh (turning)  2a0 [5]. the scale factor
planckian scale. by symmetry, lh 
a(turning)
for the closed universe has been calculated in [20]

2a0

t = 2gm0[arcsin(

a

2gm0

)1/2  (

a

2gm0

)1/2(1 

a

2gm0

)1/2].

(18)

considering the small value of a at the planck time t = 1, we can expand the above equation

and we have

a0 = [2(2gm0)1/2]2/3.

at this time, /a2

0  1, hence the ratio s/a yields

s
a  2a0

(19)

(20)

we see that in order to have s/a < 1, we need a0 < 1/2. however, from eqs. (17) and (20)

we learn that at the turning point

s
a

=

2
a3
0

,

(21)

thus the holographic bound is violated at the turning point, which means that the holo-

graphic bounds are violated much before the universe reaches the future planck era.

in order to generalize our discussion, we study in the following the (2+1)-dimensional

cosmological model proposed in [21]. the metric is determined by a time-dependent scale

factor a(t) and of the form eq.(1). the scale factor is determined by a friedmann-like

equation

(

a
a

)2 =

2gm0
a2 

k
a2

,

(22)

when the material content is a perfect uid with equation of state p = (  1), where 
is a constant. for 1 <   2, the solutions of (22) are closed, open or at cosmological
models according to whether k is 1, -1, or 0, respectively. for  < 1 the universe is lled

with negative pressure matter, a case which was discussed in four-dimensional space-time,

where it has been argued that the holographic principle can be maintained [12]. the case

 > 2, though not physical, is going to be discussed as well.

we will rst discuss the at cosmological model with k = 0. from (22), we have the

scale factor

a(t) = (p2gm0)1/t1/.

5

(23)

when  = 3/2, it reduces to the result for the radiation-dominated at universe. for large

t the comoving distance to the horizon is

rh = z t

0

dt
a(t)

=

1

2gm0(  1)

(p2gm0t)(1)/

therefore, the entropy density has the form

s
a 



2gm0(  1)a2(t)

(24)

(25)

if initially the holographic bound holds, namely /a2

0  1, then, within the region 1 <   2,
we nd again that subsequently the ratio s/a will always be smaller than unit. this result
will also hold in open universe case (k = 1).

most interesting is to see now whether the holographic bound can be realized in the closed

universe (k = 1). from (22), we nd that a vanishes at a = (2gm0)1/2(1), afterwards a

becomes negative and the universe collapses. at the turning point, we get the value of the

particle horizon lh

lh(turning) =

1

2(  1)

(2gm0)1/2(1)b(1/2, 1/2)

where b(p, q) is the euler beta function. then we see that at the turning point

s
a 



2(  1)a(turning)

(26)

(27)

let us impose that the ratio s/a is smaller than unit at the turning point. we now study

what happens near the nal stages of collapse when the scale factor reaches the planck
scales. by symmetry, at this time lh 
0  1.
hence the ratio of s/a yields

lh (turning) 

a0
  1

, and /a2

2a0

a(turning)

s
a 

a0
  1

(28)

in order that the holographic bound be realized we need a0 <   1. however, even if the
scale factor at the planck time is small enough the holographic principle will not be valid:

by the same arguments used before, eq. (27) says that the bound is violated at the turning
point, if 1 <   2.

for other values of  the situations are naively expected to be improved. for  < 1

case in four dimensions, it has been proven in [12] that this is the case. however, in three

dimensions the situation is worse, since for  < 1 equation (22) does not accomodate classical

solutions immediately after the big bang.

6

if we impose a0 <   1, we need

p2gm0 <

(  1)



and at the turning point, it is easy to see that for  > 2 we need

s
a

and there is no evident contradiction with the holographic bound for  > 2, since the above

function decreases from one (at  = 2) downwards.

however, the problem is not that simple. the restriction a0 <   1 together with eq.
(29) prevents the universe to have enough momentum to expand suciently and the universe

would collapse soon after it was born. hence the classical description used to discuss the

holographic principle by introducing unusual matter is not valid.

in summary, we have investigated the holographic principle in (2+1)-dimensional cos-

mological models. we have shown that in all at and open universes, the holographic

principle is satised in all models. this result is consistent with that obtained in (3+1)-

1

dimensional cosmologies. for (2+1)-dimensional closed universe the attempts to maintain

the holographic principle failed, no matter whether the universe is composed of normal mat-

ter, strange negative pressure matter, or strange matter with high pressure. the result for

the closed universe with negative pressure matter is quite dierent from that claimed in

(3+1)-dimensional cases [12]. the negative result for holographic principle in (2+1)-closed

universe gives us even more motivation to modify the holographic principle in cosmology.
