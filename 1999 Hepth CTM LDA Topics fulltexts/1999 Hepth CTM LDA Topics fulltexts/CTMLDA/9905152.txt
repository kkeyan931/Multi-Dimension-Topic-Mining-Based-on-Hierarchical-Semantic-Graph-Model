(8) justied low-energy regime device motion. instead, renormaliza- tion theory must carried out, course, terms ordinary generating functional eq. (8) eective expression, elds, including corresponding measuring device, considered quantum. thus, given order loop expansion supposed subdivergences green functions eliminated lower orders according standard procedure, supercially divergent diagrams rest. general result renormalization theory  procedure arranged way preserves symmetry properties generating func- tionals green functions. thus, suppose functional w renormalized, say, (n 1) th-loop order, satises identity (27)5 local divergences order n. follows eq. (17) divergences w1/ determined substitution j j(a) made. always, means corresponding one-particle-irreducible6 diagrams considered only. present case, how- ever, one may substitute j j(a0) directly, function j(a0) determined eq. (13). indeed, additional divergences associated reexpressing right hand side eq. (27) terms mean eld a, appear, assumption, n th-loop order. however, actually contribute order, since right hand side eq. (27) vanishes zeroth order, one easily verify7. thus, splitting w sum divergent convergent parts w = w div(n) + w con , noting corresponding parts identity (27) must cancel independently, obtain renormalization equation w div(n) 8: 2 w div(n) 1 = ja w div(n) 2 ka + w div(n) 1 w (0) 2 ki + w (0) 1 w div(n) 2 ki , (28) superscript (0) denotes zeroth order approximation. let us turn examination right hand side eq.
