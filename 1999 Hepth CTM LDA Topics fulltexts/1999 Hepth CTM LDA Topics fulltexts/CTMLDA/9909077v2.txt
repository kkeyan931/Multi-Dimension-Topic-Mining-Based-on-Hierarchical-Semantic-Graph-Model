abstract

we study the dynamics and thermodynamics of a probe d3-brane in the
rotating d3-brane background and in its extremal limit, which is a multicenter
conguration of d3-branes distributed uniformly on a disc. in the extremal
background, if the angular momentum of the probe does not vanish, the probe
is always bounced back at some turning point. when its angular momentum
vanishes, in the disc plane, the probe will be captured at the edge of the disc;
in the hyperplane orthogonal to the disc, the probe will be absorbed at the
center of the disc.
in the non-extremal background, if the probe is in the
hyperplane orthogonal to the disc, it will be captured at the horizon; if the
probe is restricted in the disc plane, the probe will be bounced back at a
turning point, which is just the innite red-shift hyperplane of the rotating
background, even when the angular momentum of the probe vanishes. the
thermodynamics of a relative static d3-brane probe is also investigated to
the rotating d3-brane source. two critical points are found. one is just
the thermodynamically stable boundary of the source rotating d3-branes;
the other is related to the distance between the probe and the source, which
can be regarded as the mass scale in the corresponding super yang-mills
theory. if the probe is static, the second critical point occurs as the probe is
at the innite red-shift hyperplane of the background. the relevance to the
thermodynamics of the super yang-mills theory is discussed briey.

i. introduction

over the past several years the probe method has been used extensively in investigating
the structure of black holes, the bound state of branes, dynamics, thermodynamics and sta-
tistical mechanics of branes, and so on [110]. it turns out that many calculations involving
the probe in supergravity backgrounds are in agreement with those obtained from the point
of view of eld theory.

on the other hand, there are two branches in the n =4 super yang-mills (sym) theory
in four dimensions. the higgs branch corresponds to the vevs of scalar elds being zero,
while the gauge theory is in the coulomb branch when the vevs of some scalar elds do not
vanish. according to the maldacenas conjecture [11], dierent states in the sym theory
can be described in terms of dierent congurations in supergravity. for instance, a vacuum
state of n =4 sym theory with gauge group u(n) in the higgs branch is described by n
extremal d3-branes coinciding with each other, and a thermal state of the theory is supposed
to be described by the near-extremal d3-branes. furthermore, the states of the sym in the
coulomb branch are described by multicenter d3-brane solutions. a simplest case is that n
parallel coinciding d3-branes are separated along a single transverse direction by a distance
from a single d3-brane. in this case, the gauge symmetry u(n + 1) of the gauge theory is
broken to u(n)  u(1).
however, unlike the single-center congurations, the multicenter solutions have not the
non-extremal generalizations. this results in the diculty to investigate thermodynamics
of the sym in higgs phase. recently tseytlin and yankielowicz [12] attacked this issue
and studied the free energy of the sym in the higgs phase by using the probe method.
they interpreted the supergravity interaction potential between near-extremal d3-branes
(as source) and a d3-brane (as a probe) as contribution of massive states to the free energy
of the large n sym theory at strong t hooft coupling. in this method, it is worth noting
that the source is excited, that is, the source is near-extremal static d3-branes, while the
probe does not get excited. in this way some interesting results were observed. for example,
from the free energy of the probe they predicted the existence of a phase transition. note
that there is no phase transition in the conformal case [13]. therefore phase transition may
be present in the higgs phase. in the low temperature limit they found that the structure
of terms which appear in the free energy at strong and weak couplings is the same.

recently, it has been found that it is possible to have the non-extremal generalizations
of multicenter d3-brane congurations. but these d3-branes are distributed continuously,
rather than discretely. the non-extremal generalizations of the continuously distributed
d3-branes are just the rotating d3-brane solution found in [1417], based on [18]. it means
that the sym corresponding to the rotating d3-branes is in the higgs phase. indeed, from
the calculations in supergravity, it is learned that the behavior of the sym at strong t hooft
coupling is quite dierent in the dierent branches. for example, in the higgs branch the
quark-antiquark potential has the coulombic behavior [19,20], while in the multicenter back-
grounds the potential has not only the coulombic behavior, but also the conning behavior
[2123].their thermodynamic behaviors are also quite dierent. the thermodynamics of the
static d3-branes is stable; the heat capacity is always positive-denite and hence the sym
is always in the unconnement phase [13]. furthermore the so-called localization instability
for the static d3-brane congurations does not happen [24]. for the rotating d3-branes,

2

however, it has been found that the thermodynamics of excitations of d3-branes is stable
up to a critical angular momentum density, beyond which the heat capacity will become
negative, and a phase transition may happen [2527]. the localization instability may occur
when the angular momentum reaches some critical value [28].

in this paper, we would like to investigate the structure and thermodynamics of the
multicenter and rotating d3-brane congurations by using the probe method. in the next
section we analyze the dynamics of a d3-brane probe in this multicenter and rotating d3-
brane background. the thermodynamics of the probe will be investigated in section iii. a
comparison to the case of single-center solution is also made. in section iv main results are
summarized with a brief discussion.

ii. dynamics of a probe d3-brane in the multicenter and

rotating d3-brane background

the d3-brane solutions in the type iib supergravity have six transverse spatial dimen-
sions. therefore the rotating d3-brane solutions may have three independent angular mo-
mentum parameters. for simplicity, we consider the rotating d3-brane solution with only
an angular momentum parameter. in this case, its metric is

in this solution the dilaton is a constant and the nonvanishing components of the four-form
potential are

(3)

corresponding to this rotating d3-brane solution, the r-symmetry of sym theory is broken
from so(6) to so(4)  u(1). furthermore, it is observed that the extremal limit of this
solution, m  0 keeping l xed and me2 nite, is a multicenter solution, which represents
d3-branes to be distributed uniformly on a disc with a radius l [15,16]. that is, this extremal
limit is some superposition of n static d3-branes, rather than that of n coinciding rotating
d3-branes. taking an appropriate coordinate transformation, this limiting metric becomes

(6)

on the other hand, the dynamics of a d3-brane probe is governed by the following action:

s = t3z d4xqdet g  t3z c,

(7)

where t3 = 1/2gs(2)2 = n/22r4 is the d3-brane tension. in order to investigate the
dynamics of the probe, it is convenient to take the static gauge:  = t, xi act as just the
worldvolume coordinates, and other transverse coordinates yi depend on  only. lets rst
discuss the case of the probe in the extremal background (4).

a. in the extremal background

substituting (4) and (6) into (7), we obtain

s = t3v3z d h 1

0 [q1  h0 y2

i  1],

(8)

where the overdot denotes derivative with respect to  , v3 is the spatial volume of the
worldvolume and we subtracted a constant term. for a static probe, it is obvious from
(8) that the interaction potential vanishes, which means that the source is indeed a bps
conguration. for a low-velocity probe, its action is, up to the term o(v4),

s =

t3v3

2

z d y2

i + o(v4).

(9)

it is seen that the motion of the probe is like the motion of a test particle with mass
mp = t3v3 in a at spacetime. therefore, to this order, its motion is the same as that in a
single-center d-brane background [2]. of course, this is also required by the bps property
of the system consisting of the source and the probe.

now we consider a general motion of the probe in the extremal background. generally
speaking, the motion of the probe is like that of a test particle with mass mp moving in a
velocity-dependent potential. set the probe to have the angular momentum only in some -
i = r2 +r2 2. from (8) we have the angular momentum
y2
direction, we can then write down:
l of the probe,

l =

mpr2 

q1  h0( r2 + r2 2)

.

(10)

and the energy e of the probe is

4

e =

mp( r2 + r2 2)

q1  h0( r2 + r2 2)

+ mph 1

0 [q1  h0( r2 + r2 2)  1].

(11)

from the above equation, using the expression of the angular momentum and the kinetic
relation,

e =

1
2

mp r2 + v (r),

we can obtain an eective potential of the radial motion of the probe,

v (r) = e"1 

1 + eh0/2mp

(1 + eh0/mp)2# +

l2

2mpr2

1

(1 + eh0/mp)2 .

(12)

(13)

thus, the radial motion of the probe is that of a test particle with mass mp moving in the
velocity-independent central force potential v (r). characterizing the motion is the turning
points, which satisfy the equation e = v (rc).
it can be seen clearly from the eective
potential that when the angular momentum vanishes, l = 0, there is no turning point, and
then the probe might be captured by the source.

as mentioned above, the source d3-branes are distributed on a disc in a plane dened
by y1 = y2 = y3 = y4 = 0. so it would be interesting to study the motion of the probe in
this plane or orthogonal to this plane. lets rst discuss the case for the probe moving in
the disc plane.

(i).in the disc plane. in this case, one has r2 = 2, and

h0 = 1 +

r4

(2  l2)2 ,

(14)

where 2 = y2
in this case, the eective potential becomes

5 + y2

6. indeed, the harmonic function is singular at the edge of the disc  = l.

(15)

we rst consider the far region, that is, 2  l2 >> r2. the potential has the following
behavior:

(16)

the force exerted on the probe mainly comes from the repulsive centrifugal force due to
the non-zero angular momentum l. the eect of the source is of the sub-leading order.
compared to the single-center case, where l = 0, the sub-leading eect is enhanced due to
the distribution of the source d3-branes. in the region near the edge of the disc, namely,

5

2  l2 << r2, the constant 1 in the harmonic function (14) can be dropped out. the
eective potential reduces to

(18)

in this region, the potential is a sum of two repulsive potentials. the rst term is enhanced
due to the distribution of the source, while the usually repulsive centrifugal potential (second
term) is suppressed. when 2  l2 << 2

(19)

the repulsive potential (second term) in fact is independent of the energy and is suppressed
in this case; the usually centrifugal potential (third term) becomes attractive and it is also
suppressed due to the distribution eect of the source. from (19) we see that the potential
is a constant e at the edge of the disc and the central force, f () = dv ()/d, on the
probe vanishes there. when l2 = 0, the turning point is at 2
c = l2, therefore, the probe
will be captured and it will locate at c = l; when l2 6= 0, the turning point c is

c =

2

/ +q(2

/)2 + 4l2
2

,

(20)

 = l2/mpe. therefore we can conclude the motion of the probe in the disc plane
where 2
as follows. when the probe is far from the disc, the eect due to the distribution of source is
of the sub-leading order. for the radial motion in the disc plane, the probe will be captured
at the edge of the disc if its angular momentum vanishes; the probe will be bounced back
and never be absorbed by the source if its angular momentum does not vanish.

(ii). in the hyperplane orthogonal to the disc. when the probe is restricted in a hyper-
plane dened as y5 = y6 = 0, which is orthogonal to the disc plane discussed above, we have

h0 = 1 +

where r2 = y2
function. in the asymptotically far region, we have the eective potential

once again, as expected, the distribution eect of the source is in the sub-leading order and
the main contribution to the force on the probe comes from the repulsive centrifugal force.
unlike the case in the disc plane, however, the sub-leading eect is suppressed here. in the
region near the disc, the eective potential has the following form:

v (r) = e

at the distance r >> , the eective potential takes the following form:

l2

24


r2(r2 + l2)! .

(23)

(24)

here the rst repulsive potential term is suppressed, while the centrifugal repulsive potential
is enhanced. when r << , the eective potential reduces to

v (r)  e

l2

r2(r2 + l2)2

.

(25)

in this case, once again the usually centrifugal repulsive potential becomes attractive and
it is enhanced, compared to the single-center case. the second term in (25) is a repulsive
potential, which is also enhanced due to the distribution eect of the source. from (25) we
see that the potential is a constant e at r = 0 and the central force on the probe vanishes
there. therefore the probe will be absorbed at r = 0 if the probe has no angular momentum.
otherwise, the probe will be bounced back at the turning point:

c =

(26)

b. in the non-extremal background

in this case, the background represents the rotating d3-brane solution. substituting (1)

and (3) into (7) yields

where

and

f0 = 1 +

r4

7

(27)

(28)

(29)

in this case, the static interaction potential will no longer vanish and can be written down
as:

v0(r, ) = mpf 1(h  1 + f0  f ).

(30)

the potential depends on not only the radial position of the probe, but also the azimuth
. quite interesting is that when  = /2, which means that the probe is in the disc
plane discussed above, the eect due to the rotation of the source disappears. the form of
potential implies that the static probe suers from an attractive force from the source. the
general motion of the probe is quite complicated. here we consider the motion of probe
in two self-consistent cases: one is  = 0 and 3 = const., and the other is  = /2 and
3 = const.. in the rst case, which implies that the probe is moving in the hyperplane
orthogonal to the disc plane, the action reduces to

s = mpz d f 1[qh  f r2/h  1 + f0  f ],

(33)

we are interested in the so-called eld theory limit, in which one has f  f0 = r4/r4.

here r4
by h = 0,

r2

2 (cid:16)l4 + 8m  l2(cid:17) .

(35)

from (34) we nd that the potential is a constant e at the horizon r+ and the central force,
f (r) = dv (r)/dr, on the probe vanishes there. furthermore, the turning point is just the
horizon. therefore the probe will be absorbed by the source and will locate at the horizon.
note that in this case the innite red-shift hyperplane and event horizon of the background
coincide with each other.

in the second case, namely,  = /2 and 3 = const., due to the dependence on the
angular coordinate , the motion is still complicated. to simplify the problem, we further
set  = 0, namely, the angular momentum of the probe vanishes in this simplied situation.
thus the action of the probe is also expressed by (31), but

(36)

(37)

in this case we have two turning points: one is the horizon r+ and the other is r4
c = 2m,
determined by h = 0. note that the latter is just the innite red-shift hyperplane in this
case. at these two turning points the potential is the constant e, but the central force
does not vanish there. because of rc > r+ the probe will be bounced back at rc. to
compare this to the case of static source is interesting. for the static source case, one has
h = h = 1 2m/r4. in that case, the turning point coincides with the horizon and the force
on the probe vanishes. thus the probe will be captured and will locate at the horizon.
in the calculations of the wilsonian potential in the non-extremal supergravity solutions
(for example see [29,30]), it has been assumed that the non-extremal branes locate at the
horizon of non-extremal backgrounds. the analysis in this section provides an evidence of
this assumption, at least for static background: indeed the brane can locate at the horizon
of backgrounds. however, for the rotating background, the dynamics of the brane restricted
in the disc plane poses a puzzle: the vanishing angular momentum brane cannot locate at
the horizon. perhaps we should consider the probe brane with the same angular velocity
with the background. for such a brane, we expect that it can locate at the horizon.

iii. thermodynamics of a probe d3-brane in the rotating

d3-brane background

near the extremal limit, some thermodynamic quantities of the rotating d3-brane solu-

tion (1) can be expressed as follows [26]:

e = 332mv3,
j = 7/43/2n 1/2m1/2lv3,
 = 5/41/2n 1/2m1/2lr2
+,
t = 211/41/2n 1/2m1/2(2r3
s = 211/43/2n 1/2m1/2r+v3.

+ + l2r+),

(38)

here r+ is given by (35); e denotes the energy above the extremality which equals the
adm mass of the black three-brane minus the mass of the corresponding extremal one;
and j, , t and s represent the angular momentum, angular velocity, hawking temper-
s 4 and g is the
ature, and the entropy, respectively. in addition, 22 = 16g = (2)7g2
newton gravitational constant in ten dimensions. these quantities satisfy the rst law of
thermodynamics

de = t ds + dj.

(39)

in [26] it has been observed that the heat capacity at a constant angular velocity, c =
t (s/t ), diverges at l2 = 2r2
+, namely, l4/m = 8/3, and beyond which the heat capacity

9

becomes negative. this means that the n =4 large n sym corresponding to the rotating
d3-brane conguration has a phase transition. its critical behavior at the critical point has
been investigated and some relevant critical exponents have been obtained in [26]. recall
that the sym theory corresponding to this rotating d3-brane solution is in the higgs phase.
thus the occurrence of phase transition in this rotating conguration is in agreement with
the observation that phase transitions may be present in the higgs phase [12].

corresponding to this thermodynamic system, the gibbs free energy, which is dened as

g = e  t s  j, is

gn = 

1
2

32r2

+(r2

+ + l2)v3,

and the helmholtz free energy, dened as f = e  t s, is
+  l2)v3.

fn = 

32r2

+(r2

1
2

(40)

(41)

the gibbs free energy does not change its sign, but helmholtz free energy does at r2
+ =
l2, that is, l4/m = 1. however, it is not clear by now whether this change of sign is
related or not to the hawking-page phase transition, which takes place in schwarzschild-
anti-de sitter black holes. this phase transition has been interpreted by witten as the
connement/unconnement phase transition in the sym theory [13].

next we consider the thermodynamics of a probe d3-brane. for a static probe, as
explained by tseytlin and yankielowicz [12], its distance to the source can be regarded as
a mass scale in the sym, and hence interaction static potential between the source and the
probe can be interpreted as a contribution of massive states to the free energy of the large
n sym at the strong t hooft coupling. in the rotating d3-brane background (1), to keep
relative static position of the probe to the rotating source, we have to let the probe rotate
along an orbit in the direction  with the same angular velocity  = . the euclidean
action of such a probe is

(42)

where  = 1/t is the inverse hawking temperature. since we are interested in thermo-
dynamics of sym theory through the maldacena conjecture, we consider the eld theory
limit:

r  u, m  m4,
but gs gets xed. in this limit, we have r2
forms, only dierence is that 22 is replaced by 22 = (2)7g2
(40) and (41) remain same forms as well.

where  = 2ng2
ym = 4ngs is the t hooft coupling constant. unlike the case of the probe
in the static non-extremal d3-brane background, there the free energy of the probe depends
on the temperature of source and the mass scale u of scalar elds (see [12]), here the free
energy depends not only on the temperature and mass scale, but also on the angular velocity
of the source and the azimuth . in fact, the dependence on the azimuth  means that the
probe is separated by not only a single direction from the source d3-branes. in principle,
we can eliminate m and l from (46) by using the expressions of the hawking temperature
and angular velocity in (38). in practice, however, the expression of the free energy would
be quite complicated if we did. so we keep the form (46) in the following discussions.

from the expression (46) of the free energy we see that there is a minimum, which occurs

when the square root in (46) is zero, namely,

having been given the free energy of the probe, we can acquire other thermodynamic quan-
tities of the probe immediately. for example, its entropy, angular momentum, and heat
capacity can be obtained by using following formulas:

sp =  gp

jp =   gp

cp = t   sp

(48)

below we discuss two special positions of the probe. one is  = 0. that is, the probe is
in a hyperplane perpendicular to the disc plane of the source. the free energy (46) takes a
very simple form in this case:

where  = q1  2m/u2(u2 + l2). we can also calculate the heat capacity of the probe,
but because of the complexity of its expression, we are not going to present it here. we
nd that the entropy and angular momentum of the probe diverge at l2 = 2r2
+ and  = 0,
the heat capacity has also the same property. the divergence of thermodynamic quantities
means that the existence of critical points and the occurrence of phase transitions. the rst
point is just the thermodynamically stable boundary of the source rotating d3-branes [26],
at which the ratio of the critical angular velocity to the critical temperature is

at the second point, we can also get a similar relation from  = 0,

which depends on the value u/l. for example, when u/l = 1, one has p = 2/3. the
second critical point is just the extension of the so-called maximal temperature observed in
[12] when the probe is in the static d3-brane background. furthermore,  = 0 means that
the probe is just at the horizon of the rotating source. in the static background, the rst
critical point is absent. in the rotating d3-brane background, for xed angular velocity and
mass scale, if s < p, the rst critical point will not occur, that is, the whole system is
already unstable due to the probe before the occurrence of the thermodynamic instability
of the source; if s > p, the second critical point is then absent because the whole system is
already unstable due to the thermodynamic instability of source before reaching the second
critical temperature.

in [12] it has been observed that at the low-temperature or long-distance (u  ) limit,

the free energy of the probe can be expressed as

g
p = gn +1  gn  g1,

(54)

where gn +1, gn , and g1 denotes the free energies for the n + 1 coinciding d3-branes, n
coinciding d3-branes and one d3-brane, respectively. hence the free energy of the probe
can be explained very well by the contribution of the massive states to the free energy of
sym theory at strong t hooft coupling. in our case, taking the limit u  , from (49) we
have

as expected, the relation (54) holds as well in this case.

the same happens as the rst case. that is, the entropy and angular momentum of the
probe is divergent at the source instability point l2 = 2r2
+ and  = 0. the remarks about
the thermodynamic instability in the rst case are applicable here as well. however, from
(57) we see that in the long-distance limit (large u)

that is, when u  , the free energy is divergent. obviously the relation (54) does not
hold in this case. for a general , the thermodynamic properties of the probe is similar to
the case of  = /2, the second critical point is just determined by the equation (47). in
addition, it is worth noting that when  = 0 in (46), namely, for a static probe, the relation
(54) can be recovered in the limit u   for any azimuth . in this case, the second critical
point is 2m = u2(u2 + l2 cos2 ), which corresponds to that the probe is just at the innite
red-shift hyperplane of the background.

iv. conclusions

in this work we investigated the dynamics and thermodynamics of a probe d3-brane in
the rotating d3-brane background. as is well-known, the extremal limit of the rotating d3-
brane conguration is a multicenter solution of d3-branes, which are distributed uniformly

13

on a disc; the excitations of rotating d3-branes are thermodynamically stable up to a critical
angular momentum density, beyond which the heat capacity is negative. when we discussed
the dynamics of the probe, we emphasized how the probe is captured by the source and
what is the eect of the thermodynamic stability boundary on the motion of the probe.
in the extremal background of the rotating d3-branes, the probe will be bounced back at
some turning point if its angular momentum does not vanish. otherwise, the probe will be
absorbed by the source: when the probe is restricted in the disc plane, the probe will be
captured and will locate at the edge of the disc; when the probe moves in the hyperplane
which is orthogonal to the disc plane, the probe will be absorbed at the center of the
disc.
in the near-extremal background, when  = 0, which means that the probe is in
the hyperplane orthogonal to the disc plane, the probe will be captured and locate at the
horizon of the rotating d3-branes; in the disc plane, the probe will be bounced back at a
turning point, which is just the innite red-shift hyperplane of the background, even when
the probe has zero angular momentum. we observed that a probe with vanishing angular
momentum is always captured and can locate at the horizon if the background is the static
d3-brane conguration. the dynamic analysis of the probe brane provides an evidence
of the assumption (which has been used in the calculations of the wilsonian potentials in
the non-extremal backgrounds): the non-extremal brane locates at the horizon of the
supergravity background, at least for the static source. in addition, nothing special happens
at the thermodynamically stable boundary of the rotating d3-branes from the point of view
of the motion of the probe.

the free energy was obtained of a probe which keeps a relative static position to the
rotating d3-branes, namely, the probe rotates along an orbit in the -direction with the
same angular velocity  = . the free energy depends on not only the hawking temperature
of the source and the distance to the source, but also the angular velocity and the azimuth
. from the free energy some thermodynamic quantities, for example, the entropy, angular
momentum, and heat capacity, of the probe can be worked out. we found that there are two
critical points, at which those thermodynamic quantities of the probe diverge. one point is
just the thermodynamic stable boundary of the rotating d3-branes; the other is related to
the source parameters (hawking temperature and angular velocity) and the position of the
probe. the latter can be regarded as the mass scale of scalar elds in the sym theory since
the free energy of the probe can be interpreted as the contribution of massive states to the
one of sym theory at the strong t hooft coupling. a self-consistency check of this is the
relation (54), which has been found in the static source case [12]. in our case, however, we
found that except the case of  = 0, the free energy of the probe diverges in the long-distance
limit and hence the relation (54) does not hold. from the viewpoint of eld theory, spinning
d3-branes means adding a chemical potential to the sym [15,25], due to it, our calculations
imply that the massive states have the additional contributions to the free energy of the
sym, which diverge as the mass scale goes to innity. that the relation (54) holds in the
case of  = 0 reects the fact that in fact the probe in this position is static and implies that
the angular quantum number of the massive states conjugate to the chemical potential is
zero in this case. indeed, for a static probe in this rotating source, the relation (54) can be
recovered for arbitrary  as we see above. in addition, the occurrence of the second critical
point means that the sym theory has rich phase structures in the higgs phase. finally
we mention that recently it has been found that the contribution of the massive states also

14

diverges as the sym theory is on a s3 sphere [10], in that paper the thermodynamics of a
probe has been studied in the static d3-branes wrapping on the s3 sphere.
