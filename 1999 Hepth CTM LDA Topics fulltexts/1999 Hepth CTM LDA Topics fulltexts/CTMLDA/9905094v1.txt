abstract

we study fully localized bps brane solutions in classical supergravity using a per-

turbative approach to the coupled born-infeld/bulk supergravity system. we derive rst

order bulk supergravity elds for world-volume solitons corresponding to intersecting m2-

branes and to a fundamental string ending on a d3-brane. one interesting feature is the

appearance of certain o-diagonal metric components and corresponding components of

the gauge potentials. making use of a supersymmetric ansatz for the exact elds, we for-
mulate a perturbative expansion which applies to m2m2 (0), m5m5 (3) and dpdp
(p 2) intersections. we nd that perturbation theory qualitatively distinguishes between
certain of these cases: perturbation theory breaks down at second order for intersecting
m2-branes and dp-branes with p  3 while it is well behaved, at least to this order, for
the remaining cases. this indicates that the behavior of the full non-linear intersecting
dp-brane solutions may be qualitatively dierent for p  3 than for p  4, and that fully
localized asymptotically at solutions for p  3 may not exist. we discuss the consistency
of these results with world-volume eld theory properties.

1. introduction

the fact that supersymmetric gauge theories describe the low energy dynamics of

branes in string theory has yielded many important insights, some of which are reviewed

in [1,2]. the most interesting physics arises when supersymmetry is further broken by

brane intersections. for example, witten [3] (following earlier work in [4]) has shown
how to recover the results of seiberg and witten [5] on n = 2 gauge theories in four
dimensions via intersecting m5-branes in eleven dimensions. the smooth complex curve

describing the m5-brane intersection in this construction provides a geometric realization

of the seiberg-witten curve, describing the renormalization group ow of the yang-mills

coupling.

the constructions referred to above involve branes embedded in at space. one

expects that useful complementary information could be obtained from the curved space

descriptions of these same systems. delocalized solutions for intersecting branes, in which

the harmonic function associated with each brane is smeared out over the directions parallel

to the other branes, have been known for some time (see e.g. [623], and especially [2426]

for reviews). these solutions are useful for many purposes, such as black hole entropy

counting constructions, in which the delocalized directions are compactied on a torus.

however, the smearing wipes out much of the interesting physics.

despite a good deal of eort, spacetimes describing fully localized bps brane inter-

sections have proved quite dicult to nd. in fact, it has been shown [27,28] that certain

intersections are necessarily delocalized. these results, however, were limited to either in-

tersections in which one brane is fully contained within another, or to partially localized

intersections in which one of the branes is smeared over the directions parallel to the other

brane. in this paper we will consider the existence of supergravity solutions for a class

of fully localized intersections. by fully localized, we mean that the spacetime elds have

nontrivial dependence on the coordinates along either brane, and that the sources are

appropriate delta functions. unlike the cases considered in [27,28], we are now faced with

a nonlinear set of eld equations to solve. consequently, our analysis will be restricted to

a weak eld perturbative expansion. we start with m2-branes, and solve perturbatively

for the spacetime elds due to a non-planar m2-brane source; namely, one for which the

m2-brane surface is a certain holomorphic curve associated with orthogonal intersecting

branes. however, we nd that the second order term in the perturbation series diverges.
intersections of d2-branes (d2 d2(0)) and d3-branes (d3 d3(1)) behave similarly. on

1

the other hand, in the case of m5-branes or dp branes with p  4, the second order term
is nite. one can interpet the second order results as supporting the gauge theory argu-

ments of [28] about the existence/nonexistence of fully localized bps intersecting d-brane

solutions. possibly the divergence in the perturbative expansion indicates a more general

result that there are no fully localized, non-planar, static, gravitating bps m2-branes or
dp-branes for p  3.

the question of existence probes an interesting aspect of the gauge theory description

of brane dynamics. a version of the ads/cft limit [29,30] implies [28] that the near

horizon properties of intersecting d-brane spacetimes have a dual gauge theory description.

the scale over which brane intersections are delocalized in classical supergravity turns

out to be dual to the quantum uctuations of a massless modulus eld in the gauge

theory. complete delocalization occurs when these uctuations become large due to infra-

red eects. this in turn is determined by the dimensionality of the intersection. the gauge

theory analysis in [28] accounts for the supergravity results that, for example, dp-branes

cannot be localized within d(p + 4)-branes for p = 0 or p = 1, while they may be localized
for p  2.

as a starting point for the present analysis, consider the delocalized solution for a

pair of m2-branes, one in the (t, 1, 2) plane and one in the (t, 3, 4) plane, intersecting at

the origin. the spacetime elds are

ansatz of the form (1.1) and allowing the functions f1 and f2 to depend on all the spatial

5 + . . . + 2

coordinates, i.e., not only the directions x5, . . . , x10 transverse to both branes, but also

x1, x2, x3 and x4. however, the equations of motion turn out to require that at least one

of the branes remains delocalized [3134]. if for example the m2-brane in the (t34) plane
is to be localized, we must have translation invariance in the x3, x4 directions, ie, the (t12)

brane cannot be localized. furthermore the supergravity equations then reduce to

2
f1 = 0,

f2 + f1(2

(1.2)

given a solution to the rst equation for f1, the second equation for f2 is then linear1.

it seems clear that in order to nd fully localized intersections, one must consider a

wider class of spacetimes. some physical input is then necessary to determine an appro-

priate generalization of the diagonal ansatz. our strategy is quite simple. the key in-

gredients in determining the weak eld limit of a given brane intersection are appropriate

source terms for the eld equations. these are provided by coupling the bulk supergravity

elds to brane sources via the born-infeld eective action. now, since m2-branes have

no world-volume gauge elds, the term born-infeld dynamics may seem inappropriate.

however, under dimensional reduction what we refer to here as the born-infeld action of

m2-branes reduces to the familiar born-infeld action for d-branes and it is convenient to

use the same term for both systems.

smooth world-volume solitons, sometimes called bions, describing certain non-

planar branes in a background at spacetime have been studied, beginning with the work

of [3,3537]. following the literature, we will refer to these non-planar branes as inter-

secting. these solitonic congurations are appropriate sources for the bulk eld equations

linearized around at space. in section 2, we work out the linearized elds for the bionic

source describing intersecting m2-branes. we will see from the linearized analysis that

certain o-diagonal terms in the metric, as well as certain additional components of the

gauge eld, are generated by bionic sources.

any bion generates a solution to the bulk eld equations linearized about at space.

distinctions between dierent intersecting brane congurations, however, arise when we

look at higher orders in the weak eld expansion. carrying out a perturbative expansion

based directly on the eld equations would be a tedious task. fortunately, the supersym-

metry of the bionic sources leads to considerable simplications. recently, fayyazuddin

1 the partially localized intersections studied in [27,28] are solutions to equations having this

form, but with dierent numbers of relative transverse and overall transverse directions. the

relative transverse directions are taken to be compact and f2 is expanded in fourier modes.

solutions for which f2 is localized can always be found when the two branes are separated in the

transverse directions. however, as the transverse separation is taken to zero, the fourier modes

with non-zero wave number are driven to zero unless the number d of overall transverse directions

satises d  3.

3

and smith [34] have presented an ansatz for the spacetime elds of fully localized intersect-
ing m5-branes, which preserves half of the 32 supersymmetries of d = 11 supergravity2.
the remaining undetermined function in the ansatz satises a nonlinear set of equations.

it is straightforward to alter the form of the ansatz in [34] to obtain an appropriate

ansatz for m2-brane intersections and this is done in section 3. the altered ansatz does in

fact guarrantee the existence of killing spinors appropriate to intersecting m2-branes. a

useful consistency check is that the ansatz matches the linearized solutions of section 2. by

dimensional reduction and t-duality, the same is true for solutions of dp-branes intersect-
ing dp-branes on p 2 dimensional spatial manifolds in d = 10 type ii supergravities. we
use this structure to investigate the second order perturbations to the bulk supergravity

elds. although they are nite for larger branes, for intersecting m2-, d2-, and d3-branes,

we nd that the second order perturbations diverge at every point in spacetime as we

take a delta function limit of smooth sources to represent fully localized branes. section

3 shows that this holds for a simple crossed-brane conguration, while the more compli-

cated calculations associated with holomorphic curve brane congurations are presented

in appendix a. as will be discussed in section 4, this meshes well with arguments of [28]

based on the low-energy eld theory on the d-branes and is likely to be connected with

interesting properties of full non-linear solutions.

lastly, appendix b considers the weak coupling limit of a fundamental string ending

on a d3-brane. in this case, we do not yet have an ansatz for the full non-linear space-

time elds, but we hope that our rst order results will help to motivate such an ansatz.

the weak eld results do show that the born-infeld spike soliton of [3537] generates the

appropriate ns anti-symmetric tensor eld to be identied with a fundamental string.

2. m2-brane intersections

we begin by studying the weak eld limit of a pair of m2-branes intersecting at a

point. we take the action to be given by s = sbulk + sbrane, where sbulk is the d = 11
supergravity action and sbrane is the born-infeld action for an m2-brane embedded in
curved spacetime. the bosonic parts of these are given by

sbulk =

these are conserved if the m2-brane equations of motion are satised.

in a at and empty background, intersecting m2-branes can be described by a bps

soliton solution to the world-volume equations of motion [3],[35] with two separate asymp-

totic regions

0 6= 0 the intersection region is smoothed out this scale and |0| is the
size of the neck where the two branes join. the born-infeld equations of motion in

the at background are satised for any 0 in the complex plane. now, the born-infeld
eective action is an approximation to the low-energy brane dynamics valid when certain

derivatives are small. for large 0, all curvatures of the brane are small and the born-
infeld description will therefore be accurate. furthermore, in [38] a related intersection

of d3-branes and fundamental strings was studied in which, due to supersymmetry, the

born-infeld description could be shown to be exact. in the present case, we again expect

that our born-infeld description of the brane dynamics is exact for all values of 0.

note that the parameter 0 has nothing to do with the charges of the branes; the
symmetry of the holomorphic curve guarantees that we have the same number of branes

in each of the two planes. a similar parameter occurs in d-brane intersections of the form

5

dp dp(p  2) and, in that case, corresponds to a modulus in the low energy eld theory
on the branes.

let us choose coordinates 0,1,2 = x 0,1,2 on the m2-brane world-volume. note that
this choice introduces an asymmetry between the two asymptotic regions. the brane stress

integral expressions for the functions f1(x), f2(x), (x) and (x) are then easily obtained

using the ten-dimensional greens function. the resulting expression for e.g. f1(x) is given

the lorentz gauge conditions to hold, are satised

1f1 = 3  4,
3f2 = 1 + 2,

2f1 = 4 + 3
4f2 = 2  1.

(2.13)

3. nonlinear intersecting m2-branes

in section 2, we saw that it was straightforward to derive the rst order elds for a

localized intersection of m2-branes. this raises the question of whether our analysis can

be extended to a full perturbation scheme. here, we study the second order perturbations,

which already show surprising results.

to make the analysis tractable, we rst nd a compact formulation of the full non-

linear intersecting m2-brane problem. our approach is based on the recent work of

fayyazuddin and smith [34] on localized m5-brane intersections, in which a supersym-

metric ansatz is given for the spacetime elds. we start by adapting the results of [34]

to the m2-brane case. the ansatz in this case, as in [34], depends on a single unknown

function which must satisfy a non-linear partial dierential equation. the spacetime elds

found in the last section, because they are determined by a bps source, give a leading

order solution to these nonlinear equations in weak eld perturbation theory.

7

3.1. the non-perturbative ansatz

fayyazudin and smith [34] have given an ansatz for the spacetime elds of a pair of

m5-branes intersecting on a 3-brane.

in this case, as with m2-branes intersecting at a

point, each brane has two spatial dimensions not shared by the other. the ansatz in [34] is

built around a kahler metric on this four-dimensional relative transverse space, with the
unknown function being the kahler potential. dene complex coordinates s = x1 + ix2
and v = x3 + ix4 on the relative transverse space. the ansatz for intersecting m2-branes,

analogous to that in [34], is then given by

ds2 = h 2/3dt2 + 2h 2/3gmndzmdzn + h 1/3dxdx,

(3.1)

where ,  = 5, . . . , 10, zm ranges over s, v and gmn is a kahler metric on the associated
four-space; i.e., we may introduce the potential k such that gmn = mnk. the function

h is related to the determinant g of gmn:

h = 4g = 4(gvvgss  gvsgsv).

taking the three-form gauge potential a to be related to the metric through

a0mn = ih 1gmn,

(3.2)

(3.3)

and calculating the supersymmetry variations of the elds shows that this ansatz guaran-

tees the existence of killing spinors  satisfying the projection condition

0mn  = h 1gmn .

(3.4)

it therefore yields a supersymmetric solution of 11-dimensional supergravity when the

equations of motion for the gauge eld are satised. one can show that these reduce to

the same nonlinear equation for the kahler potential k found for m5-brane intersections

in [34],

1
2

mn(8g(k) + k) = jmn,

(3.5)

where in this case the source jmn is related to the 3-form current j 
by

brane dened in (2.4)

jmn =

i
2

mm1 nn1 j 0m1n1

brane p det g11,

8

(3.6)

where det g11 is the determinant of the full eleven-dimensional metric. the i in (3.6)
guarrantees that jmn is hermitian. note that, because the determinant g = h/4 is a
density, rather than a scalar, equation (3.5) is not a tensor equation. consequently, the
form of (3.5) is invariant only under holomorphic changes of the coordinates zm for which

the jacobian is the identity.

following our general strategy, the source jmn should be consistent with the coupled
bulk/born-infeld dynamics. introducing a complex spatial coordinate  = 1 + i2 on the
m2-brane world volume, one can check that the bi equations of motion are satised for any
static holomorphic conguration x  = 0, x 0 = 0, x m = x m(), x n = x n(), whenever
the bulk elds have the form described by (3.1) and (3.3). one technical diculty is that

for a single brane with a delta function source, as in section 2, the metric and three-form

potential diverge at the source and consequently the born-infeld equations of motion are

not well dened. in order to deal with this, one may introduce a uid or dust of m2-

branes which provides a smooth source at which the bulk elds need not diverge. given

the non-linearities, the existence of smooth solutions is non-trivial even for smooth sources.

however, if we assume that they do in fact exist for arbitrary smooth sources, one may

consider a limit in which the dust density approximates a  function. in this sense, any any

holomorphic embedding of the m2-brane is a consistent source for the full coupled non-

linear problem. in particular, since an arbitrary smooth source does lead to smooth bulk

elds at rst order in perturbation theory, any holomorphic embedding of the m2-brane

is a consistent source at second order in perturbation theory.

before studying the weak eld perturbation expansion of equation (3.5) for the kahler

potential, we introduce a new set of holomorphic coordinates for the relative transverse

space (s, v), which will be useful in keeping the calculations compact. in complex coordi-
nates the world-volume of the m2-brane source is given by the holomorphic curve sv = 2
0.
this is most easily described by making a holomorphic change of coordinates with unit

jacobian:

 = sv,

 = sv ln s/v.

(3.7)

translated into the present notation, the intersecting m2-brane holomorphic curve of sec-

tion 2 yields a source of the form

j =

q
2

(2)(  0)(6)(x)

(3.8)

with j, j and j vanishing and x representing x for  = 1 to 6. here q is a charge
describing the number of branes that are present and 0 is the parameter describing

9

the neck of the holomorphic curve. note that such a holomorphic source satises the

obvious integrability condition for the existence of a solution to (3.5): there is a potential
j = q
4 ln| 0|(6)(x) such that jmn = mnj. in terms of the (, ) coordinates, the
eld equations and source are just as for a at brane, which will simplify the calculations

below. note however, that what makes the problem nontrivial in the coordinates (, )

are the boundary conditions. these are determined by the fact that the asymptotic metric

takes the standard cartesian form in terms of the original s, v coordinates, and that the s, v

coordinates are to range over (exactly) the complex plane. the result is that the coordinate

 ranges only over a strip, and that the asymptotic form of the metric is complicated in

terms of  and . thus, it is nontrivial to construct the exact solution.

however, for the purposes of this paragraph only, let us make the assumption that

the boundary conditions at innity are not important near the source. in this case, the

standard at-brane solution holds (approximately) in this region. one obtains a solution in

which, as usual, the source at  = 0 is replaced by a horizon through which the solution
may be smoothly continued. thus, if the boundary conditions are indeed unimportant

near the source, we should in the end obtain a solution of the sourceless 11-dimensional

supergravity equations.

3.2. perturbation expansion

as noted in [34], the nonlinear equation (3.5) for the kahler potential k can be solved

using a weak eld expansion. expand the kahler potential as k =pn0 k (n), where k (n)

is proportional to qn, and also introduce g(n)
at spacetime, so the zeroth order kahler metric is g(0)
follows from the zeroth order kahler potential k (0) = ss+vv

nm = nmk (n). we want to perturb around
2 ), which
. since we perturb around at

mn = mn (with ss = 1

2

spacetime, the asymptotic boundary conditions will play a central role.

the nonlinear equation for the kahler potential (3.5) is the same for both the m2-

brane intersections considered here and the m5-brane intersections studied in [34]. solu-

tions for intersecting d2-branes can be constructed by considering the setup for m2-branes,

taking the source to be independent of x10 (i.e., smearing the branes along this direction),
and using dimensional reduction. further smearing of the source can create additional

symmetry directions, and we can then use classical t-duality of the supergravity and
born-infeld theories to construct a fully localized dpdp (p 2) solution in type ii super-
gravity coupled to an appropriate brane source. thus, by letting the index  range over
an appropriate number (d = 7 p) of transverse directions, equation (3.5) in fact describes

10

intersecting solutions of the form dpdp (p2). however, as we perturb around at space
and impose asymptotically at boundary conditions in the d dimensional transverse space,
we will only analyze the cases with d  3 in detail below (i.e., dpdp (p  2) with p  4
or intersecting m2- or m5-branes).

given the form of the zeroth order elds, the rst order terms in (3.5) combine to give

where 2 here denotes the (d + 4)-dimensional at laplacian in the 4 relative transverse

let us introduce the notation [s] = 1 = [s], [v] = +1 = [v]. then, with m (n) ranging
over s, v (s, v), all the source components of equation (2.8) assemble using (3.6) into the

3.3. to converge, or not to converge?

the important question which needs to be addressed is whether the integrals (3.13)
for k j do in fact converge, starting with the second order term j = 2. we consider here the
limit 0  0 in which the smooth intersection degenerates into the singular intersection
of two perpendicular planes. although, due to the large curvature at the intersection,

the born-infeld description of the dynamics is not a priori justied in this limit, the
considerably more complicated calculations for 0 6= 0 lead to the same conclusions. these
calculations are presented in appendix a. in the 0  0 limit, the nonzero source terms
in (3.8) are given simply by

jss =

q
2

2(s)(x),

jvv =

q
2

2(v)(x).

(3.14)

the fact that jsv, jvs  0 even at s = v = 0 can be veried by integrating jsv (at nite
0) over any region invariant under s  eis, v  eiv. the rst order metric for the
crossed-plane source is just the superposition of the results for at branes at s = 0 and
v = 0. for example, the component g(1)

ss is

with an analogous expression for g(1)

(d + 2)d+3(xx + |s|2)d/2 ,
vv . the o-diagonal terms gsv and gvs both vanish.

(3.15)

g(1)
ss =

q

the integral in (3.13) for k (2) then has the form

k (2)(x0) =

(d + 2)33

d+3 z

q2

|x0  x|d+2

ddxd2sd2v

(xx + |s|2)d/2(xx + |v|2)d/2 .

(3.16)

let us analyze this integral in a small region near x = s = v = 0. in this region, we may
approximate |x0x| by a constant. introducing 2 = xx +|s|2+|v|2, the integral over this
small region factors into an integral over angles and an integral over  of the formr 3dd.
the integral over angles does not vanish as the integrand is strictly positive. thus, when
d  4, the integral diverges for any x0. however, for d = 3, the integral converges and the
second order perturbation is well-dened. although we have not explicitly considered the

cases with d < 3, it is clear that the second order perturbation will have no short distance

divergences in those cases.

this calculation suggests that higher order perturbation theory breaks down when
the number d of overall transverse dimensions satises d  4, which includes the m2-brane
intersection (d = 6). on the other hand, perturbation theory is potentially well-dened

12

for d = 3, which includes m5-brane intersections. as will be discussed further in section

4, these results t well with both the supergravity results of [28] in similar, but slightly

dierent, situations and with the predictions of that work, based on arguments in the

d-brane eld theory, for supergravity solutions of the present form.

since the divergence of second order perturbations may be unexpected, the reader may

wonder if some subtlety has been passed over through the use of singular sources. to show

that such subtleties are under control, we consider below the same calculations for smooth

sources and study the limit in which the smooth sources approximate the delta-functions

above.

3.4. smooth sources

still keeping 0 = 0, we smooth the sources according to

jss =

q
2

fl(|s|2 + xx),

jvv =

q
2

fl(|v|2 + xx),

(3.17)

where fl is a smooth, non-negative function which vanishes for r > l and has unit
0 f (r)rd+1dr = 1. note that this smoothing is simple
to carry out because of the no force condition between bps objects. with sources

normalization; i.e., satisfying dr l

smoothed over any scale l, solutions exist at each order of perturbation theory. we want
to study the behavior of solutions as we take l  0. typically there are many ways to
take such a limit in general relativity (see e.g. [39]). however, the present bps system is

highly constrained. fixing the volume integral of the current components jmn determines
the total charge via gausss law, f  = j  . therefore for each l the solution has
the same charge in the above prescription. expanding in multipole moments, we see that
to leading order in r1, k (1) stays the same for all l.

symmetry considerations guarantee that the rst order elds evaluated outside the

dust distribution are identical to those from the delta-function source, and that gsv and gvs
remain identically zero. however, the rst order elds are now smooth everywhere, so the
integral dening k (2) converges. it therefore gives the correct second order perturbation

for the smooth source.

now, consider the limit in which l  0 and fl becomes the appropriate delta function.
for any smooth fl approximating the singular source, we may divide the integral for k (2)
into an integral over a region outside the support of fl, and one over a region inside. since
the integrand in the outside region is just the same as in the delta-function case, we have

13

ss and g(1)

already seen that, for d  4, it grows without bound in the limit. now note that since
f is non-negative, g(1)
vv are positive and the source for k (2) is of a denite sign.
thus, the integral over the region containing the source contributes to k (2) with the same
sign as in the exterior region. thus, we conclude that for d  4, in the limit in which the
smooth source becomes a delta function, k (2) grows without bound at each x0.

the eect of this divergence on a physical quantity is somewhat subtle. for example,

although the divergence occurs at the same order in r1 as the term from k (1) that encodes

the total charge, it cannot in fact eect the total charge computed at innity. this is xed

by charge conservation, and the divergence can only appear in f  at higher order in

r1.

order metric perturbation g(2)

it is useful to note that arguments of the above form apply directly to the second
mn, and to the norm ||t||2  h 2/3 of the timelike killing
eld. the latter is a scalar under coordinate transformations, so that its divergence shows

that the result is not an artifact of our particular choice of gauge. thus, we conclude that

perturbation theory breaks down at second order for localized solutions of intersecting

m2-, d2-, and d3-branes. however, the second order perturbations do exist for localized
intersecting solutions of larger branes for which d  3.

now, on the one hand, it is no surprise that perturbation theory cannot construct a

full non-linear solution corresponding to a delta function source. we expect a full solution

to have a horizon, which is a strong eld eect. sources may be characterized by a charge
radius rc  q1/(d1), and by a length scale l associated with the support of f . one
expects perturbation theory to be useful for weak sources with rc/l  1, but not for
strong sources with rc/l  1 or greater. of course, the dierence between weak and
strong sources is usually apparent only when one attempts to sum the perturbation series.

what is interesting about our case is the explicit divergence of the second order term and
the fact that the behavior is very dierent for d  3 than for d  4. although we can
say nothing denite about the full non-linear solutions, this strongly suggests that their
behavior is qualitatively dierent for d  4 than for d  3. in particular, it is consistent
with the prediction of [28] that fully localized asymptotically at solutions should exist
only for d  3. in appendix a, we show that the same behavior holds for 0 6= 0.

14

4. discussion

in this work we have explicitly constructed the rst order perturbative bulk super-

gravity elds corresponding to intersecting m2-branes. the corresponding results for a

fundamental string ending on a d3-brane appear in appendix b. we also showed that, as

one would expect, any solution of the coupled bulk supergravity/born-infeld system for
intersections of the form m2m2 (0) or dpdp (p  2) is controlled by equations of the
form presented in [34] for m5m5 (3). we used this structure to analyze the second order
perturbations of the bulk elds. while these perturbations are nite and small far from
the branes for intersecting m5-branes and intersecting dp-branes with p  4, the second
order perturbations diverge everywhere in the spacetime for intersecting m2-branes and

for intersecting dp-branes with p = 2, 3.

this result appears to t well with the predictions of [28] based on eld theory con-

siderations. that work started from the observation [27] that there are no fully localized

solutions for one-branes inside ve-branes. solutions do exist when the branes are sepa-

rated in the transverse direction, but the one-branes necessarily delocalize as the transverse

separation is removed. the limit of zero separation gives one-branes smeared over the

ve-branes. it was shown in [28] that similar results hold in a number of other contexts,
such as d(p4)-branes parallel to dp-branes for p = 3, 4, or dp-branes intersecting smeared
dp-branes on a p  2 surface for p  3. this behavior is in contrast with the situation
for larger branes in which the solutions remain localized as the transverse separation is
removed3.

similar eects are found in certain near-horizon spacetimes. therefore, one expects

to have a eld theory description of this eect through an analogue of the dualities described

in [29],[30]. understanding the eld theory origin of delocalization was the main goal of
[28]. consider rst the case of d(p  4)-branes parallel to dp-branes. since both are
associated with a width of the d(p  4) branes in the directions along the dp-branes,
a natural idea is that the delocalization in classical supergravity is somehow related to

the scale size of the instantons that describe the smaller branes in the higgs phase of

the dp-brane eld theory. in dualities in general, strong eld classical eects on one side

are related to strongly quantum mechanical eects on the other.

it turns out that the

supergravity delocalization is related to the quantum uctuations of the scale size in the

eld theory. fluctuations which would be large due to ultraviolet eects are suppressed

3 the rst such localized solutions were found in [40] in the near-core limit.

15

by a string-scale cuto, but the uctuations can still be large due to infrared eects. the

relevant eld theory lives on the intersection of the two branes and delocalization occurs

in exactly those cases where this is 0+1 or 1+1 dimensional, for which the infrared eects

do indeed make the uctuations large. this uctuation-delocalization duality correctly

predicts both the cases in which the supergravity should delocalize and the rate at which

it does so as the transverse separation is removed.

now consider dp-branes intersecting dp-branes on a surface with (p  2) spatial di-
mensions. such intersecting branes are associated with holomorphic curves z1z2 = 2
0
in c2, where c denotes the complex numbers. it turns out that 0 is a modulus and is
related to the scale size modulus associated with d(p 4)-branes inside dp-branes through
t-duality. thus, one expects similar behavior in this case, with delocalization related to

the quantum uctuations of 0. as little information was available regarding the classical
supergravity solutions for fully localized intersecting branes, [28] could compare the eld

theory only with the classical supergravity solutions in which one brane was smeared over

the worldvolume of the other. for such cases, agreement was once again found with regard

both to which cases should delocalize and how fast this should happen as the transverse

separation is removed.

the natural prediction is of course that a fully localized solution in which two branes

are separated in a transverse direction should also delocalize when this separation is re-
moved and therefore that fully localized intersecting brane solutions with dpdp (p  2)
should not exist for p  3. as a result, one expects that m-theory solutions with
m2m2 (0) also should not exist. these are just the cases for which we found a di-
vergence of the second order perturbations of the bulk elds. note that since rst order

perturbation theory is linear, the lack of a well-dened second order perturbation is the

natural signature of the non-existence of fully localized asymptotically at solutions.

a small subtlety is that one should remember that the eld theory is dual to the

supergravity physics only in the near-horizon region. as a result, it is not clear just

what the eld theory arguments have to say about the existence of asymptotically at

(as opposed to near-horizon) supergravity solutions for which the neck size 0 of the
supergravity solution is comparable to or larger than the charge radius rc of the branes.
for this reason, [28] could conclude that such solutions fail to exist only for small 0. it
is interesting that our perturbative results were qualitatively the same for all values of 0,
but it is not clear to what extent the existence of full non-linear solutions for large 0
should be reected in perturbation theory.

16

having found that the second order perturbations fail to exist for d  4, it is natural to
ask about the higher order perturbations for the case d  3. do they in fact exist? this is
far from clear. the source terms for the higher order perturbations are more complicated,

and there is the potential for subtle cancellations even in the case 0 = 0. we leave this

question for future work.

appendix a. sources with 0 6= 0

we now wish to consider the second order perturbation k (2) for the case 0 6= 0.
again, we will nd that k (2) exists only for d  3. let us consider the value of k (2) at
some point x0 = (x

0 , s0, s0, v0, v0). from (3.13), this is

k (2)(x0) =

(a.1)

with g(1)
mn given by (3.11). as before, a divergence can only result from integrating over
the singularities in the rst order elds that arise at the location of the source. note, in
particular, that adding to g(1)
mn any smooth function of x with the same large x behavior
will not alter the convergence of the above integral. this is the strategy we will invoke

below.

if, instead of integrating over the entire  strip in (3.11), we restrict the integration to
be over only the the region || < 20, then this changes g(1)
mn only by a smooth function
of the sort mentioned above. in the remaining (small   ) region, it is useful to expand
e[m] /20e[m]
/20 in powers of /0 := ()/20. we write the resulting innite series
as e[m]/20e[m]/20 p (1)
mn is a series in ,  with constant coecients.
we also expand terms in the denominator in powers of /0 := /0  1. note that

where p 2 is a series in both |

p (1)
mnp (2), the integral over d2 is nonsingular, even for x = 0,  = . thus, dropping
these terms again changes g(1)
mn only by another smooth function of appropriate decrease
at innity.

having dropped the terms in p (1)

mnp (2) that are not singular at  = x =  = 0, let us
consider taking 0   to remove the restriction on the region of integration. the highest
remaining terms lead to logarithmic diverges at large , but the other terms remain nite.

thus, if we add appropriate counterterms to regulate the logarithmic divergence, taking
mn only by a bounded function and does not eect the convergence of
the second order perturbations (a.1) to the kahler potential. the details of treating the

0   changes g(1)

large  logarithms are not important, as we will see that the convergence of (a.1) at small

the eects of a term in h (1) of given order in || on the second order perturbation k (2)
are straightforward to analyze. after rescaling  by , the ,  dependence factors out.

the integral over ,  converges, and the only integrals remaining to be done are of the

form

z ddxd2 ||k
(x2 + ||2)d .

the convergence of such integrals can be studied by introducing the radial coordinate

 =pxx + ||2. the expression (a.10) factors into a convergent angular integral and a
radial integral that converges for k + 1  d.

clearly, the relevant issue is which values of k actually contribute. this is just
the question of determining the smallest power of || that appears in the numerator of
(cid:0)h (1)(cid:1)sing, which in turn can be found by studying how the rst order elds (3.11) enter
into(cid:0)h (1)(cid:1)sing. let us rst consider terms of the form (a.10) that arise from the constant

to the same order as in (a.12). note that a depends only on , . let us dene 0 = .
then k (2) involves the integral of the above expression (a.13) with respect to the measure
2d2 d20 ddx. the integral over ,  converges and clearly gives a result proportional
to (00 + xx)2(d1). we therefore see that the integral over 0, 0, x converges if
d + 2 > 2(d  1); i.e., for d  3. on the other hand, for d  4, this contribution to k (2)
diverges at every point in the spacetime.

we have now shown that, for d  4, the terms that arise from the order zero piece of
p (2) cause a divergence in k (2) at order k = 2 (in the counting of (a.10)). to conclude
that k (2) is in fact divergent, we need only show that higher order terms in p (2) cannot
cancel this divergence. this is not hard. let p (2)(1) be the collection of rst order terms
in p (2), proportional to either || or ||. a compensating divergence could only come from
the interaction of p (2)(1) with a term of order  or  in p (1)
denote the rst
order terms in p (1)
mn. due to the structure of our system, p (2)(1) always appears with either
p (1)(1)
or p (1)(1)
. however, both of these vanish. that a higher order
ss
divergence does not arise from the interaction of p (2)(1) with the zero order term p (1)(0)
in p (1)
is independent of m, n. thus, k (2)(x0) does
indeed diverge for all x0 when d  4; i.e., for m2, d2, and d3-branes.

once again, one may consider replacing the localized intersecting brane with a smooth

dust of branes concentrated in a region of size l in the transverse directions. this leads
to smooth metric functions g(1)
mn which converge to the localized brane rst order elds
(3.11) in the l  0 limit. the analysis proceeds much as in the case of a delta-function
source, but with extra integrals over 0 and the location of the brane in the x directions.
in particular, h (1) has a similar structure. thus, in the limit where the source becomes a
delta function, k (2)(x0) diverges for all x0 for d  4. as before, one can also show that
g(2)
mn and ||t||2 diverge as well.

thus, the second order perturbations are innite and perturbation theory breaks down
at second order for d  4, though not for d  3. this suggests that the full non-linear
localized solutions are quite dierent for d  3 than for d  4. in particular, it is consistent
with the prediction of [28] that localized solutions should not exist, at least for small 0.

it is interesting that the divergence encountered here does not in fact depend on the value

of 0, but it is not clear if such a feature of the full solutions should be apparent at this

level of analysis.

appendix b. strings ending on d3-branes

in this appendix we compute weak coupling solutions to the coupled d = 10 type

iib supergravity d3-brane dirac-born-infeld system, starting from the world-volume spike

soliton describing a fundamental string ending on the d3-brane [3537]. for this case, a

useful ansatz for the full non-linear metric is not known, but we hope that our work below

will help to motivate one. the total action is given by s = sbulk + skinetic + sw z, where

these terms are given in the einstein frame by

strings ending on the d3-brane. in the at background g =  with all other the bulk
elds equal to zero, given in static gauge a = x a = xa, a = 0, 1, 2, 3 by

where r2 = x2
3 and 2 = gsnf . although it looks much like the parameter
0 associated with the intersecting brane solutions of sections 2 and 3, the parameter 
appearing here is physically much dierent. it does not correspond to a modulus in the
eld theory and in fact is quantized since the number nf of fundamental string charge
must be an integer.

our aim is to linearize the bulk eld equations and compute the rst order corrections

in gs. the form (b.2) solves the born-infeld equations only in the limit of small  [35],
but this is achieved for gs  0 with nf xed. now, small  will in fact mean that, for
example, the extrinsic curvature of the embedded 3+1 surface will be large. in general,

we would not expect even the exact born-infeld description to be valid in this domain.

luckily, for intersections of this form, it was shown in [38] that the born-infeld description

is in fact exact.

let us now explore the form of the integrals fq. the symmetries of all the expressions
show that we can rotate the xi plane and the (x4, . . . , x8) plane in such a way that any
point in spacetime is equivalent to one such the only nonzero components are x3, x8 and

x9. in that situation we integrate over  obtaining,

fq(x3, x8, x9) =

(r2[(r + x3)2 + x2

(b.13)

it is easy to see that these integrals will be convergent. for r   they go like
r dr r2(q+2). note that when x3  0 both (innite) terms in (b.13) cancel each other.

the only singularity occurs when x is located over the source, that is, when

x8 = 0,

x3x9 = 2.

(b.14)

this was expected, and means that our perturbative analysis is not valid near the source.

the gure shows a plot of 8f2 (which corresponds to the dilaton) with xed x8 = 0 and

 = 1. the plot was made by evaluating the integral (b.13) numerically.

the at region is a numerical cuto near the singularity at the source; i.e., it is just
the region where 8f2  50. note how the singular region narrows, indicating a weaker
singularity, far from x3 = 0. recall that large x3 is far from the fundamental string. this
behavior is therefore expected, since we know that a pure d3-brane by itself is not a source

for the dilaton. the other functions fq and kq show similar behavior.

here we have studied only the lowest order bulk elds in the limit of small .

it

would be interesting both to understand the rst order elds produced by the exact bi-on

solution [35] and to study higher order contributions to the bulk elds. for the case where

the string passes through the d3-brane (and does not end on it), [28] would again predict

that a fully localized intersecting brane solution does not exist. the argument involves

considering the s-dual system of a d1-brane intersecting a d3-brane and identifying a set

of moduli which live on the 0+1 dimensional intersection manifold and which are t-dual
to the moduli that determine the delocalization of the d2 d2(0) intersection. in this
case, these moduli are not associate with the parameter , but rather with the fact that

the two halves of the string on opposite sides of the d3-brane can separate. note, however,

that the case considered here is somewhat dierent since we only have a string on a single

side of the d3-brane. in particular, we cannot consider this solution as a limit of solutions

in which the branes are separated in a transverse direction. therefore, it appears possible

that the present case may have dierent behavior.
