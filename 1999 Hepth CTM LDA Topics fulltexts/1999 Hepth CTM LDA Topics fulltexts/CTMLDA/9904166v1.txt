i

. introduction

quantum theories, particularly quantum gravity in (2 + 1)- dimensions provide us with a

useful eld of investigation not only for theoretical and mathematical issues, but also in

some cases, for actual physical problems [1, 2]. in the past decade many interesting physical

problems in (2+1)-gravity have been solved, such as classical scattering, quantum scattering,

2

bound states of a scalar and spinor point particle both in the presence and absence of a

magnetic monopole and also magnetic vortex [3, 4, 5, 6]. in reference [6] some interesting

results have been obtained in studying quantum scattering and bound states of a scalar

charged particle in the background metric corresponding to (2 + 1)- manifold both with local

and global constant curvature in the presence of a magnetic monopole, which satisfy the

coupled einstein-maxwell equations.

here in this article we investigate the quantum mechanics of a charged spin 1

2 point par-

ticle on a (2 + 1)- spacetime with spatial part of local constant curvature in the presence

of a constant magnetic eld of a magnetic monopole. we show that these 2-dimensional

hamiltonians have the degeneracy group of sl(2, c) type and para-supersymmetry of ar-

bitrary order or shape invariance. using these symmetries we have obtained their spectra

algebraically. also, the dirac quantization follows naturally from the representation theory.

in the case of local constancy of the curvature, the presence of angular decit suppresses

both the degeneracy and shape invariance.

the paper is organised as follows: in section ii we briey describe the (2 + 1)- spacetime

metric of reference [6] and assume that angular decit is absent. section iii is devoted to

the algorithm of the manipulation of the dirac operator in these spacetimes. the dirac

operator has been given in terms of the generators of the sl(2, c) lie algebra, which reduces

the familiar dirac operator on the s2 in special case [7]. in section iv we obtain the left and

right invariant generators of the sl(2, c) lie group in terms of eulers angles [8], where after

eliminating the  coordinate we get the eigenspectrum of massless dirac operator together

3

with its degeneracy which is in agreement with those of reference [7] in special case of s2.

also, as a special case, we obtain the massless dirac operator in the presence of a magnetic

vortex [5, 9]. in section v we add the constant magnetic eld of the magnetic monopole.

using again the representation of the sl(2, c) lie group we obtain the eigenspectrum of a

charged spin 1

2 particle algebraically together with its degeneracy group. as a special case we

obtain the monopole harmonics [10, 11, 12] . also we obtain the familiar dirac quantization

from the representation theory.

in section vi, using the right invariant generators and

eliminating the coordinate , we obtain the raising and lowering operators of the magnetic

charge. using them we show the presence of the para-supersymmetry of arbitrary order

p, or equivalently, the shape invariance symmetry associated with the dirac operator in

the presence of a magnetic monopole. finally in section vii we add the angular decit to

the background spacetime metric which leads to the suppression of both degeneracy and the

shape invariance symmtery. thus we obtain the eigenspectrum by solving the dirac operator

by usual method which is in agreement with the result of the reference [4] for special case of

the cone.

ff   lm},

(2.1)

where lm is the matter lagrangian corresponding to a very massive point particle with mass
m located in the origin. we have rescaled g by a factor of 4. as it is shown in reference

[6] the following (2 + 1)- spacetime metric corresponds to a massive point mass m together

with nonnegative cosmological constant  and magnetic monopole eld

ds2 = dt2

(d2 + (1  gm)2 sin2

d2).

where  and  satisfy the following relation

 = 2,

(2.2)

(2.3)

and gm satises the condition gm < 1. the parameter  in equation (2.3) chooses one of

the values 0, 1, i. in the case of  = 1,  is a positive real number and we have

0   < ,

0   < 2.

for  = i,  is a negative real number and (2 + 1)- spacetime metric (2.2) is euclidean. in

this case we have 0   <  and the range of  is the same as  = 1 case. finally for  = 0,
 is a positive real number again and  plays the role of the radial variable [6] and the range

of the coordinate  is the same as  = 1, i case. the magnetic monopole eld corresponding

to the system (2.1) is

b = g(1  gm) sin ,

(2.4)

with

g =

if  = 0 and 1

if  = i

(2.5)

which extremizes the einstein-hilbert action given in (2.1).

in other words they are the

solution of the einstein-maxwell equation which extremizes this action. the magnetic eld

given in (2.4) is the magnetic eld of a magnetic monople located in the origin of the r3

euclidean space where the constant curvature spatial part of the spacetime is embedded in

it. the corresponding magnetic potential one-form a in the coordinates  and  is

a = g(1  gm) cos d.

(2.6)

in the next section after introducing the abstract dirac operator we write it on the spatial

part of metric (2.2) in the case m = 0.

iii

. dirac operator on two dimensional spaces with

global constant curvature

the massless dirac operator on a given d-dimensional riemannian manifold with metric

g can be written as [7, 8]:

d = iae 

a ( +

1
8

ab[a, b]),

(3.1)

6

where a, s are the generators of the at cliord algebra which satisfy the following anti-

commutation relation:

{a, b} = 2ab

a, b = 1,   , d.

(3.2)

, ab are d-beins and spin connections, respectively, which satisfy the following

also e 

a

relations:

e 

a g e 

b = ab

e 

a e b

 =  b

a

e a

  

 e a

 + abe b

 = 0.

(3.3)

here in this article we are concerned with the manifolds described by metric (2.2) and gauge

potential (2.6). we also assume that m vanishes in the rest of the article except in the last

section. then the spatial part of the metric (2.2) reads:

ds2

(2)

=

1
2

(d2 +

sin2 

2

d2),

(3.4)

it is clear form the above metric that the spatial part consits of a 2-dimensional manifold

of global constant curvature. using the equations (3.3) we obtain the following expression

for the nonvanishing components of zwei-beins and spin connections associated with metric

(3.4):

1 = 2, e 
e 

2 = 2



sin 

12 =  cos .

7

(3.5)

by using the equation (3.1), we obtain the dirac operator on a manifold described by metric

(3.4) as follows:

d2 = i21( +

1
2



tan 

)  i22 

sin 

.

(3.6)

for  = 1, d2 becomes the dirac operator on the 2-dimensional sphere s2 [7]. it is more

convenient to consider the 2-dimensional manifold (3.4) as a submanifold of the 3-dimensional

manifold m3 with the line element

ds2

(3)

= dr2 + 2r2(d2 +

sin2 

2

d2),

which is parametrized with the following local coordinates:

x1 = r sin  cos 

x2 = r sin  sin 

x3 = r cos .

now we consider r = constant submanifold of m3 with the following metric:

ds2

(2)

= 2r2(d2 +

sin2 

2

d2).

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

for  = 1 and r = 12

> 0 this submanifold coincides with the special case of  = 1

of two dimensional manifold with metric (3.4), while for  = 0, with the assumption of

, it is the same as  = 0 case of metric (3.4). finally for  = i,

limo,r r = f inite = 12
with the assumption r = 12||
dene the dirac operator on the manifold m3. using the equations (3.3), for nonvanishing

> 0 it changes to  = i case of metric (3.4). now we try to

components of 3-beins and spin connections we get

r

, e 

2 =

r sin 

, e r

3 = 1

13 = , 21 = cos , 23 = sin .

(3.10)

finally, using the relations (3.1) and (3.10) the dirac operator associated with metric (3.7)

reads

d3 = i1 1

r

( +

tan 

)  i2 1

  i3(r +

(3.11)

it is straightforward to see that the dirac operator d3 yields

,

(3.12)

with a dened as

a = i3a,

a = 1, 2

which satisfy the following cliord algebra

{a, b} = 2ab.

(3.13)

assuming the equivalence of the metric of submanifold given in (3.9) with the two dimen-

sional metric (3.4) and also replacing r with 12

, we can deduce that the operator (3.12) is

the same as dirac operator d2 given in (3.6). in terms of local coordinates (3.8) the operator

d3 can be written as

d3 = ii i,

9

(3.14)

where i, s are pauli matrices. using the identity ( i xi

r )2 = i, we have

d3 = (

ixi

r

)2d3 = i

i xi

r

(r +

i
r

ijk ixj k).

(3.15)

now, comparing the operator (3.15) with (3.11), it follows that the operator 3 has the

following form

3 =

ixi

r

.

(3.16)

using the relations (3.12) and (3.15) together with the relation (3.11) the dirac operator d2

over two dimensional manifold with metric (3.4) can be represented as

d2 =

1
r 

i
r

ijk ixj k = 2(1i1 + 2i2 + 3i3 + i),

(3.17)

where i is a 2  2 identity matrix and the dierential operators ii with i = 1, 2, 3 in (3.17)
have the following form:

i1 = i(sin  +

cos )



tan 


i2 = i( cos  +

tan 

sin )

i3 = i ,

and satisfy the following sl(2, c) lie algebra

[i1, i2] = i2i3

[i2, i3] = ii1

[i3, i1] = ii2.

(3.18)

(3.19)

it is clear that for  = 1 this algebra becomes an su(2) lie algebra, for  = i we get su(1, 1)

lie algebra, and nally for  = 0 we get iso(2) lie algebra [6, 15].

10

iv . degeneracy group of the dirac operator on two

dimensional manifolds with global constant

curvature

in order to obtain the degeneracy group of the dirac operator d2 over two dimensional

manifold with metric (3.4) we need to know the left and right invariant generators of sl(2, c)

group which have the following form in the eulerean coordinates [6]

l(l)

1 = i(sin  +

2 = i( cos  +
l(r)
3 = i ,

sin )

(4.1)

where 0   < 2, 0   < 4 and 0   <  for  = 1, while 0   <  when  = 0, i. it
is rather well known that both left and right invariant generators satisfy sl(2, c) lie algebra

denoted by sl(2, c)l and sl(2, c)r, respectively and also they commute with each other. that

is we have

[l(l)

1

, l(l)

2

] = i2l(l)

3

[l(l)

2

, l(l)

3

] = il(l)

1

[l(l)

3

, l(l)

1

] = il(l)

2

,

[l(r)

1

, l(r)

2

] = i2l(r)

3

[l(r)

2

, l(r)

3

] = il(r)

1

[l(r)

3

, l(r)

1

] = il(r)

2

,

[ ~l(l), ~l(r)] = 0.

(4.2)

11

now, using the generators (4.1) we dene the following new bases:

k (l)

1

:= l(l)

1  i +

1
2

1

k (l)

2

:= l(l)

2  i +

k (r)

:= l(r)

k (r)

2

:= l(r)

2  i

k (l)

3

:= l(l)

3  i +

k (r)

3

:= l(r)

3  i.

1
2

3,

(4.3)

using the commutation relations (4.2) and the properties of pauli matrices it is rather

straightforward to show that the newly dened left and right invariant operators (4.3) also

satisfy sl(2, c) lie algebra separately and commute with each other. now, the operator f

dened as

f := 2(1l(l)

3 + i),

1 + 2 l(l)

2 + 3l(l)

commute with all the generators given in (4.3), that is

[f, ~k (l)] = 0,

[f, ~k (r)] = 0.

(4.4)

(4.5)

therefore, in order to obtain the eigenspectrum of operator f , we need the set of commu-

tative operators expressed in terms of operators (4.3),which are

{k (r)

3

, k (l)

3

, k (l) 2

1

+ k (l) 2

2

+ 2k (l) 2

3

, k (r) 2

1

+ k (r) 2

2

+ 2k (r) 2

3

}.

then, we have the following simultaneous eigenvalue equations

k (r)

3  = q

k (l)

3  = m

(k (r) 2

1

+ k (r) 2

2

+ 2k (r) 2

3

) = 2l(l + 1)

(k (l) 2

1

+ k (l) 2

2

+ 2k (l) 2

3

) = 2j(j + 1).

(4.6)

12

obviously the operators k (r)

3

and k (l)

3

have the following dierential form

k (r)

3 = 

3 =

therefore, the two component spinor  reads

 =

2 )+iqf1()

2 )+iqf2()

.




(4.7)

(4.8)

in equation (4.8) a and b are constants and f1 and f2 are functions of variable . in order

the spinor  to become a periodic function of  with period 2 , the quantum number m

must be a half integer number. now, using the left and right invariant generators (4.1) we

have:

l(l) 2

(4.13)

where  is constant of normalization. note that in equation (4.13) q takes integer values

because m can take on only half integer values as said before [13]. now, by taking the

operator f of eq (4.4) to the power two we arrive at:

f 2 = 2(k (l) 2

l,j=l 1

(4.14)

now, transfering the factor eiq which appears in the wavefunction (4.13) to the left of the

operator f and eliminating it from both sides of equation (4.14), we get:

specially for  = 1 we get the dirac operator on s2 [7], and the eigenfunction introduced in

(4.16) becomes the wellknown spinor harmonics [10].

where  is the new constant of normalization. the operator f (q), in the limit of   0

in this limit the operator f (q) has the following eigenvalue

is the eigenstate associated with the scattering of a massless fermion from a vortex.

it is

obvious that in the case q = 0, (4.17) and (4.18) represent the wavefunction and the dirac

operator of a free massless fermion on two dimensional at space respectively. in the next

section we obtain the eigenspectrum of the dirac operator in the presence of the magnetic

monopole (2.4) for the special case of m = 0.

v . the dirac operator on a 2-dimensional manifold

the massless dirac operator on a riemannian manifold with metric g in the presence

(5.1)

therefore, using the beins and spin connections given in (3.5) and considering the gauge

the manifold described by the metric (3.7) and by the gauge eld with connection

ar = 0

a = 0

a = g cos .

(5.3)

using the beins and spin connections given in (3.10) and gauge eld connection (5.3), the

(5.6)

where it satises the following gauge condition

~r. ~a = 0.

in the local coordinates (3.8) together with the gauge connection (5.6), the dirac operator

can be written as

d3(a) = i(

1
i

i + eai).

(5.7)

with further little algebra one can show that the dirac operator given in (5.7) takes the

following form:

d3(a) = (

ixi

r

)2d3(a) = i3(r 

1
r

~.~r  (

1
i

~ + e ~a)).

(5.8)

finally using the relation (5.5) between the operators d2(a) and d3(a), the dirac operator

on the 2-dimensional manifold (3.4) and in the presence of magnetic eld of a magnetic

monopole is

d2(a) = f (eg)  2eg3.

(5.9)

therefore, according to section 4, we have the following eigenvalue equation

d2(a)

l,j=l 1

2 ,m,q

(, ) = s22[(j +

1
2

)2  q2]

l,j=l 1

2 ,m,q

(, ),

(5.10)

where q is equal to the product of electric and magnetic charge, that is

q = eg.

therefore, the dirac quantization condition follows naturally from the nite representation

of sl(2, c) lie group. also j + 1

2  q and for j + 1

2 = q the operator (5.9) becomes

noninvertible. it is clear that for  = 1, the operator d2(a) becomes the dirac operator on

s2 in the presence of magnetic eld of magnetic monopole [11, 12] with monopole harmonics

as its eigenfunctions.

vi

. para-supersymmetry and shape invariance of

dirac equation

in this section using the left and right invariant generators introduced in section 4, we

try to investigate the shape invariance symmetry and para-supersymmetry of 2-dimensional

dirac operator. here it is more convenient to work with bases {j (r)
with {l(r)

3 } which are dened as:

, l(r)

 = l(r)

j (r)

3 = i .

clearly these new bases have the following commutation relations

(6.1)

(6.2)

using the relations (4.9) and (4.10) we arrive at:

l,j=l 1

2 ,m,q

(, , ),

l,j=l 1

2 ,m,q

the above relations indicate that j (r)

+  i and j (r)

  i are raising and lowering operators

of index q respectively, that is:

j (r)

(6.4)

now by transfering eiq, which is only  dependent factor in the eigenspinor

to the left-hand sides of the lowering and raising operator in (6.4) we arrive at

(6.6)

eigenspinors

2 ,m,q

the basis for a representation of para-supersymmetry of order p, where p is an arbitrary

integer. according to [15, 16], the non-unitary para-supersymmetric algebra of order p can

be generated by parafermionic generators of order p, denoted by q1 and q2 and a bosonic

20

generator h, which satisfy the following relations

qp

1q2 + qp1

1 + q2qp

1 = 2pqp1

1 h

1 q2q1 +    + q1q2qp1

2 = 2pqp1

[h, q1] = [h, q2] = 0.

by introducing the operators

x+(q) := j (r)

+ (q)  i

x(q) := j (r)

 (q)  i

hq := hq  i,

(6.7a)

(6.7b)

(6.7c)

(6.7d)

(6.8)

we can represent the generators q1, q2 and h by the following (p + 1)  (p + 1) matrices of
the form

(q1)qq := x(q)

q+1,q

(q2)qq := x+(q  1)

q,q+1

(h)qq := hq 

q,q

q, q = 1,   , p + 1,

(6.9)

where each element of these matrices is a 2 2 matrix. in (6.9) we need to choose the hamil-
tonians h, withq = 1,   , p + 1 so that the generators (6.9) satisfy the para-supersymmetric
algebraic relations (6.7). the generators q1, q2 and h, as dened in (6.9), satisfy the

equation (6.7c), but the equations (6.7a,b) lead to the following equations:

x+(p  2)   x+(1)x+(0)x(1) +    + x+(p  2)x(p  1)x+(p  2)x(p  3)   x+(0)+

21

x(p)x+(p  1)x+(p  2)   x+(0) = 2px+(p  2)x+(p  3)   x+(0)h1

(6.10a)

x+(p  1)   x+(1)x+(0)x(1) + x+(p  1)   x+(2)x+(1)x(2)x+(1) +    +

x+(p 1)x(p)x+(p 1)x+(p 2)   x+(1) = 2px+(p 1)x+(p 2)   x+(1)h2 (6.10b)

x(1)   x(p1)x(p)x+(p1)+x(1)   x(p2)x(p1)x+(p2)x(p1)+   +

x(1)x+(0)x(1)x(2)   x(p  1) = 2px(1)x(2)   x(p  1)hp

(6.10c)

x(2)   x(p  1)x(p)x+(p  1)x(p) +    + x(2)x+(1)x(2)x(3)   x(p)+

x+(0)x(1)x(2)   x(p) = 2px(2)x(3)   x(p)hp+1.

(6.10d)

finally equations (6.7d) imply the following equations

hq x(q) = x(q)hq+1

hq+1x+(q  1) = x+(q  1)hq .

(6.11)

now, dening the hamiltonians hq , q = 1,   , p as:

hq =

(6.12)

22

by the denitions (6.12) relations (6.11) are satised for the special case q = p. in order the

relations (6.11) to be satised for q = 1,   , p  1, too we need to choose the constants cq
as:

where

eq+1  eq = cq  cq+1,

eq := 2[l(l + 1)  q(q  1)].

(6.13)

(6.14)

to obtain relation (6.13) we have used the following shape invariance property between the

operators x(q)

x+(q  1)x(q)  x(q + 1)x+(q) = eq  eq+1.

(6.15)

substituting (6.12) in formula (6.10a), and also using the shape invariance property (6.15)

we obtain

c1 =

1

[(1  p)e1 + e2 + e3 +    + ep].

finally combining (6.13) with (6.16) we obtain

cq =

(6.16)

(6.17)

from (6.17) we can see that the following relation among the constants cq holds

c1 + c2 +    + cp = 0.

using the substitution (6.12) and the shape invariance property (6.15) together with the

constants cq given in (6.17) one can straightforwardly show that all the equations (6.10b,c,d)

are satised, too. also using the result given in (6.17) and the shape invariance relation (6.15)

23

it follows that the hamiltonians hq are isospectral and we have

hq

q = 1,   , p + 1.

(6.18)

with

substituting eq in (6.19) and by using the relation (6.14) we get

e =

2[3l(l + 1) + 1  p2].

in a similar manner by substituting (6.14) in (6.17) we have

cq =

2[3q(q  1) + 1  p2].

(6.19)

(6.20)

(6.21)

substituting the constants cq in (6.21), and also using the relations (6.6) and (6.8) after the

substituting (6.12) we obtain the explicit dierential form of the hamiltonian hq as

the bases of the representation of para-supersymmetric algebra of order p can be represented

(6.24)

it follows rather trivially from the commutation relations (6.7d) and also from the relations

(6.7c) that qq

l,j=l 1

(6.25)

the representation of para-supersymmetry algebra of order p is valid even for the special

case of  = 0. using the relation (4.17) in the limiting cases of   0 and l   we arrive
at the following shape invariance relations

i

(6.26)

note that in the limiting case of  = 0 there is neither any highest nor lowest state in the

realization of para-supersymmetry, since there is no rst order dierential operator which

can kill any of the bessel functions. in this case we can have a para-supersymmetry of innite

order where the bessel functions form its bases.

vii

. solution of dirac equation on 3-dimensional

manifolds with a local constant curvature

for nonvanishing m, the spatial part of the metric given in (2.2) describes a 2-dimensional

manifold with local constant curvature. in this section we try to solve the dirac equation of

25

a point mass m and charge e on the manifold with metric (2.2), in the presence of magnetic
eld with connection (2.6). the angular decit due to the presence of a very heavy point

mass m destroys the global constancy of the curvature, hence we lose both the degeneracy

and para-supersymmetry. therefore, we cant solve the dirac equation by the algebraic

methods anylonger. thus we have to solve it by an ordinary method of solution of coupled

rst order dierential equations. in a at (2 + 1)- spacetime one can represent the dirac 

matrices as [4, 5]

0 = 3

1 = i2

2 = i1 ,

(7.1)

where a, a = 0, 1, 2 close the cliord algebra as

{a, b} = 2ab

a, b = 0, 1, 2.

(7.2)

the minkowski metric ab has the following signature

ab = diag(+,,).

one can write the metric (2.2) in the following form

ds2 = dt2  2(2d2 +

sin2 

2

d2),

(7.3)

where 2 and  are dened as:

 = 1  gm
(1  gm)2

.

2 =

2

26

since  is negative when  = i we have 2 < 0, hence the metric (7.3) is euclidean while

for other values of  it is minkowskian. we can choose the three-beins associated with the

metric (7.3) as:

e a
 =

sin 

( +iea)]m}(t, , ) = 0, (7.9)

where  and  are dened as:

 =  sin 1 + cos 2.

in the limiting case of   0, the coordinate  becomes similar to a radial coordinate r and
the dirac equation (7.9) in the absence of gauge eld a becomes exactly the dirac equation

associated with a massive fermion on a (2 + 1)- spacetime dimension with conical spatial

part [4]. now let the dirac spinor has the following time dependence

(t, , ) = eiet(, ),

together with the following  dependence

(, ) = 


ei(m 1

ei(m+ 1

(7.10)

where m is a half integer number. one can show that the functions f1() and f2() satisfy

the following dierential equations

with c as a real number, one can give the solutions of equations (7.11) in terms of hyperge-

ometric functions [17]. in the limiting cases of , e  o and c   such that the product
c remains constant we obtain [17]
