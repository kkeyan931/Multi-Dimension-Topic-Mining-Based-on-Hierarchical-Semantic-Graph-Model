abstract

we compute the 3-point function of the stress-energy tensor in the d-dimensional cft from the adsd+1
gravity. for d = 4 the coecients of the three linearly independent conformally covariant forms entering
the 3-point function are exactly the same as given by the free eld computations in the n = 4 sym just as
expected from the known renormalization theorems. for d = 3 and d = 6 our results give the value of the
corresponding 3-point function in the theories of strongly coupled n = 8 superconformal scalar and (2, 0)
tensor multiplets respectively.

1 introduction

the maldacena conjecture [1]-[3] relating the large n limit of certain conformal eld theories in d-dimensions
with supergravity on the product of the d + 1 dimensional anti-de sitter space with a compact manifold have
been recently tested by explicit computation of many 2- and 3-point gauge theory correlation functions from
the ads supergravity [4]-[20]. a considerable progress was also achieved in studying 4-point correlators [21]-
[27], whose complete computation, however, requires the knowledge of the supergravity action on the ads
background beyond the quadratic [28] approximation.

an important question being yet unsolved with 3-point functions is computation of the 3-point function
of the stress-energy tensor tij(~x). unlike the other 3-point functions that are determined by the conformal
symmetry almost completely (usually up to one constant), the 3-point function of tij(~x) in general dimension d
admits ve independent conformally covariant forms, two of them being xed by the gauge theory conservation
law itij(~x) = 0 [29]. three constants undetermined neither conformal symmetry nor the conservation law
might be computed from the ads supergravity and confronted with their free-eld counterparts. this obviously
provides a further nontrivial test for the ads/cft correspondence.

in this paper we therefore address the problem of computing the 3-point function of the stress-energy tensor

in the d-dimensional cft from the adsd+1 gravity.

according to the ads/cft conjecture the cft current of conformal weight zero coupled to the stress-
energy tensor of conformal dimension d is extended to the interior of the ads space as the on-shell graviton
eld. in comparison with 3-point functions of other gauge-invariant composite operators computation of the
3-point function of tij(~x) is complicated by two things. firstly to cure up the infrared divergences of the gravity
action one can introduce the boundary of the ads space. the hamiltonian formulation [13] of the ads/cft
correspondence then naturally requires additional boundary terms [8], so that the pure gravity action is not
given only by the standard einstein-hilbert term. it is worth stressing that the account of the boundary terms
is absolutely necessary since they provide the fullment of the ward identities in the boundary cft. the second
thing is that after introducing the boundary terms the gravity action looses its manifest conformal as well as
gauge invariance.

in our computation of the 3-point function we account the boundary terms in the following way. we start
with the standard einstein-hilbert term (with the cosmological constant) and decompose it up to the cubic
order in metric perturbation h . removing all terms linear in second derivatives as well as all total derivative
terms we are left with an action that according to [13] diers from the action one should use in the ads/cft
correspondence only by terms that do not contribute to the green functions. then, by the on-shell perturbation
theory, one may nd that the contribution of the quadratic terms to the value of the 3-point is exactly zero.
thus, the remaining action is just the sum of the cubic bulk and the boundary (noncovariant) terms, the latter
arise due to the removal procedure. fortunately, the cubic boundary terms do not contribute to the value of
the 3-point function and by this reason can be disregarded. the bulk term is manifestly covariant w.r.t. the
ads isometries as well as on-shell gauge symmetry and that apparently solves the second diculty.

choosing the covariant gauge we then explicitly compute the remaining bulk integral and get the 3-point
function. for the physically most interesting case d = 4 we realize that the coecients of the conformal
tensors of the 3-point function are exactly the same as the ones found by the free eld computations. this
is obviously in agreement with the earlier results by [12, 30, 31], whose essence is that in four dimensions the
superconformal symmetry is powerful enough to protect some 3-point functions in n = 4 yang-mills against
quantum corrections.
as to the other cases of particular interest d = 3 and d = 6, at the moment we are unaware of the gauge
theory calculations and may suggest that our results give the value of the corresponding 3-point function in the
theories of the strongly coupled superconformal scalar and (2, 0) tensor multiplets respectively.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we dene the gravity action one should use in the ads/cft
correspondence and obtain its decomposition up to cubic order in metric perturbation. in the third section we
compute the on-shell value of the gravity action in the de donder gauge and obtain the 3-point function. we
then write down explicitly the coecients of the conformal tensors occuring in the 3-point function in dimensions
d = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and comment the most interesting cases. some details of the calculation are collected in the
appendix.

2 gravity action at third order of perturbation

we begin by xing the basic notation. let m be a d + 1 dimensional manifold with a d-dimensional boundary.
throughout the paper the indices , , . . . run the set 0, . . . , d, while i, j, . . . are reserved for the d-dimensional
boundary and take values 1, . . . , d. the coordinates x are then splitted as x = (x0, ~x) with ~x = {xi}. let m
be also supplied with a positive signature metric g .
we will deal with the euclidean version of the adsd+1 space that is described as the upper half space

m = {xi  r;

x0 > 0} endowed with the metric

ds2 =

dxdx.

1
x2
0

the boundary of adsd+1 space is at x0 = 0 and can be identied with the euclidean space. since the boundary
is innitely distant from any interior point the gravity action on the ads background suers from infrared
divergences. a natural regularization is then provided by putting the boundary of adsd+1 space at x0 =  and
considering the part with x0  . the physical elds are required to vanish when x0  .
sum

the total gravity action s one should use for computing gauge theory correlation functions is given by the

s = s + s(1) + s(2)

(2.1)

2

of the standard einstein-hilbert term ( with the cosmological constant  = 1

2 d(d  1))

s =z g(r  2)

and two boundary terms s(1) and s(2) [8]. explicitly, s(1) is the gibbons-hawking term [32]

(2.2)

(2.3)

where k is the trace of the fundamental form on the boundary and g is the determinant of the induced metric.
the second boundary term s(2) is a term proportional to the volume of the boundary:

s(1) = 2zm

ddxp gk,

s(2) = 2(1  d)zm

ddxp g.

(2.4)

as was shown in [13], adding the boundary terms is equivalent to removing from the bulk action (2.2) all
terms linear in second derivatives and all total derivative terms. the gravity action obtained in such a way
diers from (2.1) only by terms which do not contribute to green functions. therefore we can restrict our
attention to considering the bulk term.

if we assume g to be the background ads metric and perturb g near the background value: g =

g + h, then equations of motion r = dg up to the second order in h can be written as follows

l = v ,

where two tensors

and

l = h +  h  h  h + 2(h  gh),

v = (h(h + h  h )) + (hh)

2hh + hh
were introduced. here the covariant derivatives are taken w.r.t the background metric.

(2.5)

(2.7)

introduce the notation

r = r + r(1)

 + r(2)

 + ... = r + r +

1
2!

(2)r + ...

for decomposition of the ricci tensor around the background r and analogous one for decomposition of the
curvature.

now we are ready to analyse gravity action (2.1) up to the third order in metric perturbation. we start

with working out decomposition of (2.2):

s = s + s +

1
2!

(2)s +

1
3!

(3)s + ...

computing the rst variation s of (2.2) one then represents it in the form

s[g, h] = zm

g(cid:18)r 

1
2

gr + g(cid:19) h + t,

where t is the following boundary term

t =zm

g( h  h) = zm

g(h0  0h).

(2.8)

(2.9)

in (2.9) we consider s[g, h] as the variation of s[g] at a point g , i.e. we do not assume the metric g
to be equal to its background value. now the simple algorithm to nd decomposition (2.8) is to consider the

3

succesive variations of s[g, h]1. since we are interested in decomposition of the total action (2.1) we can omit
the total derivative term t .

thus, varying the terms in parenthesis in (2.9) and reducing the result to the background we get

r(1)

with these formulae at hand it is now easy to nd the action (2.2) up to the third order in h :

where we again omitted nonessential total derivative terms. note that the last term in the integrand coincides
with the third order term in the decomposition of g, in which one tensor h is replaced by l. the action
(2.10) depends on second derivative terms. to remove these terms one should add to (2.10) total derivative
terms which can be easily found by using explicit expressions (2.6) and (2.7) for l and v respectively. a simple
cons ideration then shows that the quadratic terms in the resulting action do not contribute to the 3-point
green function.

thus, we see that to nd the 3-point function we need to compute the on-shell value of s which is given by

s =

g(v

gv )h + cubic,

(2.11)

here h is a solution to the linearized equation of motion: l[h] = 0 and cubic refers to the unwritten
explicitly total derivative terms of the cubic order. since these terms may deliver only a local contribution to
the value of the 3-point function in what follows we disregard them.

3 three-point green function

the radiation gauge for the ads gravity that is eectively used for computing the two-point green function
of the stress-energy tensor in the boundary cft obviously breaks the invariance of the gravity action under
isometries. for the 3-point function this fact leads to severe diculties in computing the bulk integrals. thus,
to handle the problem we choose the covariant gauge of the de donder type:

in this gauge the solution of the linearized equations of motion reads as [8]:

(cid:18)h

 h(cid:19) = 0.

(3.16)

the computation of (3.16) is a rather combersome but purely technical task that can be performed by the
inversion method of [7]. before plugging into details we make some comments about the relation between the
bulk and the boundary gauge transformations. the symmetry group of action (3.16) is now reduced to the
gauge transformations that preserve the de donder gauge. this group of residual gauge transformations is
generated by vectors  obeying an equation   d = 0. explicitly, the solution satisfying the gauge
 = 0 reads as

(x0, ~x) = vz ddy

i (x  ~y)i(~y),

v =

,

(3.17)

where the coecient v is xed by requiring i(x0, ~x)  i(~x) when x0  0. in particular, the component 0 is

0(x0, ~x) =

v

d + 1z ddy

xd+3
0

(x2

0 + (~x  ~y)2)d+1 ii(~y).

one may see that on the boundary (  0) the residual gauge transformations are reduced to

hj

i = ij + ji 

2
d

ij(kk),

(3.18)

i.e. to the usual gauge transformations of a traceless symmetric tensor. in other words, the transformations
(3.18) of the boundary data can always be prolonged to the bulk gauge elds, which preserve the de donder
gauge. we, therefore, expect the 3-point function tij,kl,mn(~x, ~y, ~z) =< tij(~x)tkl(~y)tmn(~z) > of the stress-energy
tensor tij to obey the conservation law

itij,kl,mn(~x, ~y, ~z) = 0,

for noncoincident ~x, ~y and ~z.

as was already mentioned in the introduction in arbitrary dimension d > 3 there are ve independent con-
formal tensors occuring in the expression for the 3-point function of the stress-energy tensor. the conservation

5

law then xes the value of two from ve coecients. it is clear that the 3-point function dened by s is con-
formally covariant and the only reason to nd its explicit expression is to make comparison of the coecients
of conformal tensors to the ones found on the gauge theory side.

thus, substituting (3.13) in (3.16) we see that according to the ads/cft prescription [2, 3] the 3-point

function is dened as2

where sum is taken over all possible permutations of sets of indicies and points (ij, ~x), (kl, ~y) and (mn, ~z) of the
following tensor

tij,kl,mn(~x, ~y, ~z) = 8x iij,kl,mn(~x, ~y, ~z),

recall that here and in what follows the bulk (boundary) indices are contracted w.r.t. the ads metric (eu-
clidean) and, therefore, only their positions matter. note that the tensor iij,kl,mn itself is not conformally
covariant.

following the method of [7] we now put in (3.20) ~x = 0 and perform the change of variables

in view of (3.19) it is further more convenient to deal with the integral i sym

the coecients a, ...,e computed for any dimension d  2 represent our basic result. we rst discuss the
most interesting case d = 4. in this case by using the table 1 of the appendix one nds for a, ...,e the following
values

a =

c =

(3.27)

now we are ready to confront the coecients (3.27) with the ones found by the free eld computations in
n = 4 sym. to this end one needs to restore the gravity coupling g2
g that enters as an overall constant in
front of the total action s. the value of the coupling constant is xed by the type iib supergravity on the
ads5  s5 background and is equal to

g2
g =

82
n 2 .

clearly, to restore the g2

g-dependence of the 3-point function we should multiply (3.27) on g2

g and obtain

recall that the 2-point function of tij(~x) found from the adsd+1 gravity is given by

< tij(~x), tkl(~y) >=

cd

|~x  ~y|d iij,kl(~x  ~y)

(3.28)

(3.29)

with the central charge cd = 2kgd

. in particular, for d = 4, one gets c4 = 80

in [33] it was shown that for any four-dimensional free eld theory given by ns scalars, by nf dirac fermions

and by nv vector elds the coecients a,b,c are as follows

1

a =

ns  16nv(cid:19)
ns + 4nf + 32nv(cid:19)
ns + 2nf + 16nv(cid:19) .
substituting here the eld-theoretical content of the n = 4 su (n ) sym:

6 (cid:18) 8
6 (cid:18) 16
6 (cid:18) 2

b = 

c = 

1

27

27

27

we, thus, arrive at

ns = 6(n 2  1), nf = 2(n 2  1), nv = n 2  1,

a = 

128
96 (n 2  1), b = 

392
96 (n 2  1),

c = 

184
96 (n 2  1).

(3.30)

the central charge c4 can be found by taking into account the ward identity that relates c4 with coecients
a,b,c of the 3-point function [29]:

c4 =

2
12

(9a  b  10c) =

10
4 (n 2  1).

it is now obvious that in the large n limit the coecients a,b,c and c4 of the n = 4 su (n ) sym coincide
with the ones found from the ads5 gravity.
thus, the coecients a, b and c of the conformal tensors obtained from the ads5 gravity and reecting
thereby the strong-coupling behavior of the corresponding gauge theory do not receive corrections to their free
eld (one-loop) values. this fact nds a good agreement with the results by [12, 30, 31]. indeed, the traceless
conserved stress-energy tensor occurs in the multiplet of the supercurrent t = tr(w 2), where w is an analytic
supereld describing the n = 4 yang-mills strength multiplet. in [12] it was checked for the leading components
of t being the scalar elds that their 3-point functions computed from ads5  s5 supergravity coincide with

8

the one-loop results in the large n limit. the same conclusion about vanishing of the radiative corrections at
order g2 was achieved in [30] even for nite n . by considering the anomaly in the superconformal symmetry,
it has been argued in [31] (see also [7]) that the 2- and 3-point functions of t should actually have a one-loop
nature.

d = 2, 3, 5, 6 that can be found from (3.24) together with (a.1)-(a.3).

having discussed the four-dimensional case, we now list explicitly the coecients a, ...,e for dimensions
d = 2:

a =

(3.34)

in [29] it was shown that the conservation law implies the fullment of the following two identities

(d2  4)a + (d + 2)b  4dc  2d = 0,
(d  2)(d + 4)b  2d(d + 2)c + 8d  4e = 0.

it is needless to say that coecients (3.27) and (3.31)-(3.34) satisfy both of them. it is, of course, only the check
that we have done the computation of (3.16) correctly. one should be also aware of the fact that for d = 2 and
d = 3 the number of linearly independent conformal tensors is reduced to 1 and 2 respectively [33].

the cases d = 3 and d = 6 are of particular interest since according to the ads/cft conjecture they
correspond to compactications of the 11d supergravity on ads4s7 and ads7s4 respectively. we, therefore,
expect that coecients (3.32) describe the 3-point function of tij(~x) in the strongly coupled three-dimensional
gauge theory of the n = 8 conformal scalar multiplet while (3.34) are expected to be found in the six-dimensional
gauge theory of the (0, 2) tensor multiplet [34]-[37].
