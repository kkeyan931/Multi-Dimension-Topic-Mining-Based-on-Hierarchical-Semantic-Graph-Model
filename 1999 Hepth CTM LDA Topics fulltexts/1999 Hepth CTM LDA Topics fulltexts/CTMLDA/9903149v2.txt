abstract

motivated by the search for a spacetime supersymmetric extension of the n =2
string, we construct a particle model which, upon quantization, describes (abelian)
selfdual super yangmills in 2+2 dimensions. the local symmetries of the theory
are shown to involve both worldline supersymmetry and kappa symmetry.

1. introduction
recent progress [1, 2] in a stringy description of (2+2)dimensional selfdual yangmills
and selfdual gravity triggered by investigations of n=2 strings (see [3] for reviews con-
taining further references) stimulates interest in the construction of supersymmetric ex-
tensions. the rst formulation of such a supersymmetric selfdual system [4] has been
obtained from a constraint system known earlier as the d=10 abcd superstring (or
superparticle) [5], by truncating it to a selfdual superspace.

since the proposed set of constraints fails to form a closed algebra [6], it was suggested
to examine a smaller but closed subset. two corresponding n=2 string models were
constructed [6, 7]. however, their massless states, although consisting of a scalar and
a spinor, do not interact according to selfdual super yangmills (sdsym) or selfdual
supergravity (sdsg)2.

it is well known that quantum eld theories appear not only as lowenergy limits
of string theories but also upon quantization of pointparticle models. guided by the
connection of the n =1 superparticle to n =1 d=10 super yangmills theory, it is tempting
to investigate similar relations in a superspace based on r2,2 which we call kleinian
superspace. the knowledge of the zero mode structure for that case is likely to clarify the
construction of a full superstring.

yet, the conventional n=2 string [10] does not possess spacetime supersymmetry
(see, however, ref. [11]). its point analogue [12] is the n=2 case of a spinning particle
with nextended local worldline supersymmetry [13]. upon quantization in d=4 such a
model describes two massless irreps of the poincare group, labelled by helicities  n
2 . for
n=2 these are just the selfdual resp. antiselfdual parts of ordinary yangmills theory.
even though the n=1 spinning string turns into the superstring after the gso treat-
ment, spacetime supersymmetry is not present in spinning particle or n=2 string models
and, thus, requires an enlargement of these theories. the incorporation of rigid supersym-
metry in the d=4 spinning particle (which provides also a  symmetry) lifts the original
poincare irreps to super poincare irreps of superhelicity  n
2 [14, 15]. one immediately
concludes that the only possibility involving the n =1 sdsym multiplet is to choose n=1
(see also ref. [14]).

our consideration suggests that a stringy extension of sdsym may have to be doubly
sypersymmetric, i.e. possessing both local worldsheet supersymmetry and  symmetry
(for an earlier consideration of doubly supersymmetric models see e.g. ref. [16]). it is
the purpose of the present letter to construct a doubly supersymmetric particle model in
kleinian superspace which describes abelian sdsym when covariantly quantized.

2. abelian sdsym
let us begin by reminding the reader of the spinor notation in kleinian at spacetime
in order to x our notation. the covering group of the lorentz group in r2,2 factorizes as

spin(2, 2) = sl(2, r)  sl(2, r)

,

(1)

2a successful stringy extension of n =1 sdsg was achieved by de boer and skenderis [8] who combined
a conventional n =2 string in the rightmoving sector with a greenschwarzberkovits type sigma model
[9] in the leftmoving sector.

1

and we distinguish weyl spinors with respect to the two factors by employing undotted
and dotted early greek indices, respectively. the standard convention is applied when
contracting spinor indices, i.e. 2 =  and 2 =    . contrary to the case of
sl(2, c), the fundamental sl(2, r)() spinor representations are majoranaweyl and,
hence, not related by complex conjugation. we take all spinors to be real whereas sigma
matrices are chosen to be imaginary.

irrespective of the spacetime signature, abelian sym is described by a single ma-
jorana spinor supereld (w, w ). a convenient way to incorporate the selfduality
condition in kleinian superspace is to drop the antichiral spinor supereld strength and
work with w alone [17]. thus, our starting point is

d w(x, , ) = 0

and

dw(x, , ) = 0 ,

(2)

where d =  +    and d  =      are the usual covariant derivatives. for
r2,2 this is consistent because w is real and automatically fullls the majoranaweyl
condition.3

the rst of equations (2) is just the chirality condition which species the eld content

of the problem and reduces the component expansion of w to

w(x, , ) = (x) + f(x) + 2(x)

+  

 (x) + 1

2 2 

 f 

(x) + 1

4 2 2(x)

.

(3)

the second condition in (2) is the equation of motion. decomposing f = f() + f
one nds

f (x) = 0 ,
 f()(x) = 0

,

(x) = 0 ,

 (x) = 0

.

(4)

(5)

the rst of eqs. (4) implies that f are the components of a selfdual eld strength;
the rst of eqs. (5) is nothing but the corresponding bianchi identity. the latter guaran-
tees (locally) the existence of a selfdual vector potential (we symmetrize with weights),

f() = (

a) 

with

0 = (  a

)

.

(6)

all equations above are invariant under abelian gauge transformations (acting only on

a) as well as under (1,1) supersymmetry:

 = f()

and

a  = 2     f() = 2 (

)  

(7)

where  and   are two independent (real) majoranaweyl spinors of opposite chirality.
it is worth mentioning that the supersymmetry algebra closes (modulo gauge transforma-
tions) only onshell, i.e. with the use of the selfduality condition.

we shall go on to construct a spinning (super) particle model which, when covariantly
quantized, yields eqs. (2) (in their complexied form). it is known that the quantum wave

3the integrability conditions for (2) imply that w obeys the weyl equation in the external index.

function of a conventional spinning particle is realized in terms of four component dirac
(and not weyl) spinors [18]. it is therefore convenient to rewrite our starting point (2) as

(1 + 5)ab wb = 0 ,

n

ab nwb = 0 ,

(8)

d wa = 0 ,

(9)
n 0(cid:17) the dirac matrices in kleinian
with wa = (cid:16) w
at spacetime.4 the rst two equations dene an onshell chiral fermion, while the
remaining ones govern supersymmetry.

w (cid:17) a majorana spinor and n = (cid:16) 0 n

 dwa = 0

,

3. chiral fermion model
a technique for obtaining the massless dirac equation from rstquantized particle me-
chanics has been known for a long time. it suces to start with the action [18]

s = z dn 1

2e

( xn + in)2 + in no ,

(10)

where n and  are anticommuting real vector and scalar variables, respectively. quan-
tization modies the grassmann algebra to a cliord algebra, so that the n will be
represented by gamma matrices.
incorporation of the chirality condition 1 + 5 = 0
into the model (10) turns out to be more involved. as was shown in ref. [19], naively
implementing the classically analogous constraint [12] by adding a lagrange multiplier
term

s = z d  (1 + abcdabcd)

(11)

is classically inconsistent5 since taking the body of the constraint equation implies 0 = 1.
interestingly, the contradiction seems to be avoided when one imposes only the time
derivative of the classical contraint. on the quantum level, however, one has to be more
inventive. an elegant solution is provided through an extension of the system by a con-
ventional fermionic oscillator.6 so, let us consider the following action,
s = z 2

3 nmklnmkl)o . (12)
the variables e, xn,  are even, the remaining ones are odd. we regard all variables to
be real except for  =  . reality of the kinetic term7 implies the boundary condition
|2
1 = 0, which restricts the trajectories entering the variational problem. the equations
of motion in the (, ) sector,

 + i = 0

and

  i  = 0 ,

(13)

t = c 1nc with c = 01 in kleinian spacetime.

4 note that n
5 the approach followed in ref. [20] suers from the same problem [19].
6 a similar extension for the massive dirac particle has been employed in ref. [21].
7 alternatively, we could start with a conventional kinetic term    , which would lead to an

equivalent quantum description in terms of creation/annihilation operators.

and

d ( )

(14)

with a constant 0 = ( 0)
observes that only the constant modes 0 and 0 enter the  equation of motion,

conforming to the boundary condition. from eq. (14) one



i  2

3 nmklnmkl = 0 .

(15)

since (, ) do not appear elsewhere, this is consistent with other equations of motion, in
particular with

nmkl nmkl = 0 .

(16)

before going over to the hamiltonian analysis we list the lagrangian local worldline

symmetries of the model:

,

2e n + 4

xn =  xn + n  nmklmkl
n =  n + 1
 =    i
e = (e) + 
 = () + 

3 nmklmkl  3
2e nmklmkl
  =   + i 
,
 = () +  ,
 = () + 4

,

3   4

3  +  ,

,

,

,

(17)

where we denote n  xn +nmklmkl +n. in addition to worldline reparametriza-
tion invariance and local supersymmetry of the massless spinning particle (10), there ap-
pears a couple of new local symmetries with bosonic () and fermionic () parameters
and their corresponding gauge elds  and , respectively. it is straightforward to check
that the symmetry algebra closes only modulo the equations of motion.

let us now analyze the system in the hamiltonian formalism. evaluating the set of

primary constraints8

pe = 0 ,

p = 0

pn  n = 0

,

p = 0 ,

,
p   = 0 ,

,

p = 0
p  = 0 ,

(18)

one nds the canonical hamiltonian to be

h = pee + p + p + (pnn)

+ 1

2 ep2  nmklpnmkl  pnn   (i  2

n + p + (p) + p  
3 nmklnmkl)

,

(19)

where the s are the lagrange multipliers associated to the primary constraints. consis-
tency conditions for the primary constraints imply the secondary ones,

pnn = 0 ,
p2 = 0 ,

i  2

3 nmklnmkl = 0 ,
nmklpnmkl = 0 ,

(20)

8we dene momenta conjugate to anticommuting variables to be right derivatives of the lagrangian

with respect to their velocities.

and x some of the lagrange multipliers,



n = 1

2 pn  3

 = i

2 nmklpmkl + 4
  = i 
and

3 nmklmkl
.

,

(21)

to show that no tertiary constraints arise at the next stage of the dirac procedure, one
needs the wellknown identity

abcdef gd = 6 [a

eb

f c]

g = 6 a

[eb

f c

g]

.

(22)

the rst line in eqs. (18) contains a set of rst class constraints. imposing the gauge

e = 1

,

 = 0

,

 = 0 ,

 = 0

allows us to omit four canonical pairs, the xed lagrange multipliers being9

e = 0

,

 = 0 ,

 = 0

,

 = 0 .

rewriting the second of eqs. (20) in the equivalent form

ip + ipp   2

3 nmklnmkl = 0

,

(23)

(24)

(25)

one decouples the (second class) constraints in the sector (, p ) from the others. in this
fashion we may drop those variables, after having introduced the associated dirac bracket.
the brackets for the remaining variables prove to be canonical. finally, by making use of
the shift

n  

n = n + 1

2(pn  n)

so that

{

n, 

m} = 1

2 nm ,

(26)

one can also isolate the second class constraint pnn = 0. regarding it further as a
strong equation, one nally arrives at the following constraint set,

pnn = 0
p2 = 0

,

,

ip  2

3 nmklnmkl = 0 ,
nmklpnmkl = 0 ,

(27)

which forms a closed algebra under the dirac bracket.

quantization is now straightforward. one promotes classical variables to quantum

operators (here in position representation),

xn = xn

,

pn = i



xn

,

n = 1
2 e

3i

4 n

,

 = 

,

p = i




, (28)

which act on the corresponding quantum state represented by a wave function

a(x, ) = ua(x) +  wa(x)

.

(29)

9 eqs. (23) applied to eqs. (21) also imply  = 0 =   which puts the hamiltonian (19) into its real

form. it was originally complex due to our choice for the  kinetic term.

5

the latter is a dirac spinor since it is acted upon by r2,2 dirac matrices n
ab. in what fol-
lows, we assume the qpordering in the sector (, p). in agreement with general principles
we assign positive grassmann parity to the xdependent functions in the expansion (29).
hence, the complete state has no denite parity.

physical states are characterized by the fact that the rst class constraint operators

annihilate them. eqs. (27) then yield

u(x) = 0 ,

(1 + 5)w (x) = 0 ,

nnw (x) = 0 .

(30)

at the quantum level, the second line in eqs. (27) follows from the rst one.

thus, after quantization, the model (12) describes a single onshell chiral fermion.

4. adding rigid supersymmetry
to obtain the remaining equations (9) from the quantization of our particle mechanics it
suces to extend the original conguration space {xn} to a superspace {(xn, ,  )}, by
adjoining a pair (,  ) of kleinian majoranaweyl spinors, and to provide a couple of
rst class constraints

p   p  = 0

and

p p  = 0

(31)

when passing to the hamiltonian formalism. this is achieved by extending the action (12)
just like in the construction of siegels superparticle [5] (see also related works [22, 23]),

s = z 2

1

2e ( xn  i n  + in  + nmklmkl + n + in )2

dn 1
+ n n +      +  (i  2

3 nmklnmkl)o .

(32)

here,  and   are auxiliary (real) odd variables. we switch back to spinor notation.
the model is invariant under rigid spacetime supersymmetry transformations

x  = 2(     )

,

 = 

,

   =  

.

(33)

the set of local symmetries is extended by a pair of new symmetries, including kappa
symmetry,

 = e1  

,

 = 0 ,

   = 0 ,
   =  

,

x  = 2(     )

,

e = 4  

 

and

where

 = 0
 = 2 e1   

,

,

   =  
   = 0 ,

,

x  = 2  

,

e = 4    

,

  = x   2    + 2    +     +   + 2   

.

(34)

(35)

(36)

6

as is seen from the transformations above, the  symmetry allows us to remove the 
variable, which is compatible with the rst of the rst class constraints (31) arising in the
hamiltonian formalism.

the hamiltonian analysis for the extended model proceeds along the lines of the
previous section. in addition to the seven earlier primary constraints (18), one nds four
new ones,

p = 0 ,

p   p  = 0 ,

p  = 0

,

p   p    = 0 , (37)

while the hamiltonian (19) acquires the contribution

hadd = p

 + p 

 + (p   p   )

 + (p   p )

    p 

. (38)

time translation invariance of the new constraints (37) yields a new secondary one as
well,

and species some of the lagrange multipliers, i.e.

p  = 0 ,

 =  p 

,

 = 2 

p 

.

(39)

(40)

no tertiary constraints appear at the next stage of the dirac procedure. in the sector of
the additional variables (, , , ) the full set of constraints may then be written as

p   p    = 0 ,

p = 0 ,

(41)

(p   p )p  = 0

,

p   p  + 2 p

p  = 0 ,

p  = 0

,

(42)

the constraints (42) are rst class. imposing the gauge (implying  = 0)

  = 0 ,

(43)

one can omit the variables (, p). the pair (41) is second class and can be taken as
strong equations after introducing the associated dirac bracket. the dirac brackets for
the remaining variables turn out to coincide with the poisson ones. upon quantization, the
remaining constraints will append two additional restrictions to equations (30), namely

d wa(x, , ) = 0

and

 dwa(x, , ) = 0 ,

(44)

with wa from (30) acquiring now (, ) dependence. beautifully enough, these are pre-
cisely the equations describing abelian selfdual super yangmills in their complexied
form.10

10 in r1,3, time reversal is often used to impose a reality condition on the wave function [12], which
is, of course, only admissible for energy eigenfunctions. for r2,2 however, this is not an option because
there is no notion of orthochronicity.

7

5. concluding remarks
to summarize, in this letter we have constructed a particle model which describes (abelian)
sdsym upon quantization. the theory is essentially doubly supersymmetric, i.e. com-
bines the features of the greenschwarz and neveuschwarzramond formalisms.
in
order to attempt a superstring generalization, it seems natural to start with a string ana-
log of the action (12), followed by the implementation of kappa symmetry. we envisage
that the fermionic oscillator degree of freedom, being inessential in the particle case, may
exhibit a nontrivial inuence on the string spectrum. another (heterotic) possibility is
provided by combining the standard nsr set of constraints in the left-moving sector with
the constraints of ref. [6] in the right-moving sector. such an approach is likely to be
related to that of ref. [8].

as has been discussed in ref. [15], the global symmetry structure underlying a wide
class of doubly supersymmetric particles is that of the superconformal group. it would
be interesting to perform a similar analysis for the formulation at hand.
