abstract: we extend the results found for matrix string theory to heterotic matrix
string theory, i.e.
to a 2d o(n ) sym theory with chiral (anomaly free) matter and
n = (8, 0) supersymmetry. we write down the instanton equations for this theory and
solve them explicitly. the solutions are characterized by branched coverings of the basis
cylinder, i.e. by compact riemann surfaces with punctures. we show that in the strong
coupling limit the action becomes the heterotic string action plus a free maxwell action.
moreover the amplitude based on a riemann surface with p punctures and h handles is
proportional to g22hp, as expected for the heterotic string interaction theory with string
coupling gs = 1/g.

1. introduction

the purpose of this paper is to extend to heterotic matrix string theory (hmst),
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] the results obtained recently for matrix string theory (mst),
[11, 12, 13, 14, 15] (see also the related papers [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]). in the latter it
was shown what had been previously conjectured in [22, 23, 24, 25], namely that mst, i.e.
u (n ) sym theory in two dimensions with adjoint matter and n = (8, 8) supersymmetry,
describes in the strong coupling limit iia superstring theory and all its string interactions.
the relevant riemann surfaces are dynamically generated via bps instantons, which are
referred to throughout as stringy instantons. each riemann surface (with p punctures and
h handles) is associated to a corresponding string process in an obvious way. to verify the
correctness of this association the action was expanded about an instanton; it was shown
in [14] that the resulting amplitude is proportional to g
, where gs is the string coupling
constant (i.e. the inverse of the yang-mills coupling) and  = 2  2h  p is the euler
characteristic of the riemann surface. this is what one expects from perturbative string
interaction theory. relying on this basic result, in [15], we set out to analyze the moduli
space of stringy instantons and found that it does not exactly coincide with the moduli
space of compact riemann surfaces with punctures, which is relevant to closed string the-
ory, but it mimics it very closely: in fact it is a discretized version of the latter in the sense
that some of the moduli are discrete. however these moduli become continuous in the
n   limit. we argued in [15] that in this limit the moduli space of stringy instantons
does reproduce the moduli space of riemann surfaces relevant to the type iia theory.

in the present paper we extend the above result to the hmst. the latter is an o(n )
sym theory with chiral (anomaly free) matter and n = (8, 0) supersymmetry. we rst
write down the instanton equations for this theory. then we show how one can solve
them explicitly. the solutions are of course dierent from the mst case, but they span
the same kind of branched coverings of the basis cylinder, i.e. the same kind of compact
riemann surfaces with punctures, as in mst. we then expand the action about any such
instanton in the strong coupling limit. the details are dierent from the mst case and
somewhat subtler (see appendix), however the nal result is similar to mst. the strong
coupling limit action is the heterotic string action plus a free maxwell action. moreover the
amplitude based on a riemann surface with p punctures and h handles is proportional to
g2h+p2
, as expected for the heterotic string interaction theory. at this point the analysis
s
of the moduli space of stringy instantons goes through as in [15]. this moduli space is
a discretized approximation of the moduli space of riemann surfaces in heterotic string
theory. the approximation gets better and better as n becomes larger.

the paper is organized as follows. section 2 is devoted to heterotic stringy instantons.
in section 3 we expand the action around any instanton solution and compute the strong
coupling limit. the appendix contains a few details of the relevant calculations.

2. the 2d sym model and classical supersymmetric congurations

the heterotic matrix string theory (hmst) is specied by an o(n ) sym model in a 2d
euclidean space-time. we will choose n even, n = 2n. the action is

s =

[x i, x j]2 + i(sd ws  cdwc)

where we use the complex notation

w =

( + i) ,

w =

(  i) ,

aw = a0  ia1 ,

a w = a0 + ia1 ,

where  and  are the world-sheet coordinate on the cylinder.
in (2.1) g is the gauge
coupling, x i with i = 1, . . . , 8 are real symmetric n  n matrices. a0, a1 are real anti-
symmetric nn matrices. the covariant derivative is dened as dwx i = wx i[aw, x i].
fw, w is the gauge curvature. summation over the i, j indices is understood. s(c) repre-
sents 8 n  n symmetric (antisymmetric) matrices whose entries are 2d real spinors and
simultaneously transform in the 8s and 8c representations of so(8).  are 2d fermions
transforming according to the fundamental representation of o(n ) and the fundamental
representation of so(32). the matrices i are the 16  16 so(8) gamma matrices. for
deniteness we will write the matrices i in the form

i = (cid:18) 0

i

i

0 (cid:19) ,

(2.2)

and i, i are the same as in appendix 5b of [27]. all the elds in hmst are periodic on
the cylinder.

2

the action (2.1) is chiral, however the fermion representations are such that the gauge
anomaly vanishes (see also appendix). it is invariant under the supersymmetry transfor-
mations (n = (8, 0) supersymmetry)

the hmst, in the strong coupling limit, is expected to represent heterotic string
theories. we can enrich the content of (2.1) by introducing wilson lines. the corresponding
a=1 ababb, where b is a real antisymmetric

term in the integrand of (2.1) is b = p32

matrix.

a specic choice of b leads to a theory in which, for example, so(32) is broken
to so(16)  so(16). via a t-duality transformation this theory can be related to the
ten-dimensional e8  e8 heterotic theory broken down to so(16)  so(16) by another
suitable wilson line, see [7, 8, 9, 10].
in the absence of wilson lines it is expected to
represent so(32) heterotic string theory compactied to nine dimension on a very small
circle.

all this, as well as the s-duality connection with type ia and type ib theories [28, 29],
is well-known. however the introduction of wilson lines does not aect our subsequent
derivation. therefore we will drop them throughout and resume them at the end of our
derivation.

2.1 interpretation of the strong coupling states
the naive strong coupling limit (g  ) in the action, after rescaling a  ga, tells us
that all the x i, aw, a w and  commute, and aw = 0.

denoting with a bar the elds in the strong coupling limit, one sees that there are two

types of solutions. let us denote by 1 the 2  2 identity matrix and by  = (cid:18) 0
1 0(cid:19).
the rst type of solution is: aw = a  , c = c  , x i = xi  1 and s = s  1, where
a, xi, c and s are diagonal matrices. moreover  is such that  aw  = 0, which implies
that half of the degrees of freedom of  must vanish. for a reason that will be explained
below, we actually scale out c by multiplying it by a suitable power of 1/g, so that in the
above formulas it is understood c = 0.

1

a second group of solution is characterized by aw = 0. consequently x i and s are
generical diagonal matrices (without the two by two identication of eigenvalues as before).
supersymmetry then requires that c = 0.

3

in the following we refer to these two group of solutions as rst and second branch,
respectively. although one can hardly attach too much importance to these naive elabora-
tions, they actually turn out to be very suggestive and not at odds with the results of the
more appropriate treatment presented later.

it is well-known that in the strong coupling theory there is a residual gauge freedom,
which contains the weyl group of o(n ) and allows a variety of boundary conditions.
each one of them, in the rst branch, denes a string congurations. let us consider, for
example, a solution from the rst branch. we have in particular x i = diag(xi
n)1.
the distinct eigenvalues of the latter can be interpreted as free strings of various lengths.
for instance,1 let us consider the eect on x i of the element p  p  1 of the weyl group
of o(n ), where

the boundary condition x i(2) = p x i(0) p1 implies that xi
k1(0), and so the
xi
k form a unique long string of length 2n. a parallel interpretation holds for the fermionic
degrees of freedom. we see that, apart from the gauge eld, we get the spectrum of the
free heterotic superstring. the gauge degrees of freedom need further specication. here
we only anticipate that the gauge eld will turn out to be essential for the interpretation
of the strong coupling limit of hmst as heterotic string interaction theory.

k(2) = xi

one may wonder at this point why above we scaled out c and not in its stead the full set
of  degrees of freedom. we would have obtained in this way, apart from the gauge degrees
of freedom, the spectrum of the free type iia superstring theory. the answer is that there
are various indications that the strong coupling limit in this case would be discontinuous.
for example, the hmst is a chiral fermionic theory, while the strong coupling limit would
not be chiral. moreover the supersymmetry transformations inherited by those of hmst
(see (2.3) are not those of the type iia. therefore we exclude the possibility of such a
strong coupling limit.

we can proceed similarly also for the second branch solutions. they have apparently
a spectrum which coincides with the heterotic superstring spectrum. however, one sees
immediately that the residual discrete gauge transformations, which form the weyl group
of o(n ), are not the expected ones for a heterotic string interpretation of this branch.
this is a spy of of the fact that, as will become clear later on, the strong coupling limit of
the second branch, if it exists, cannot be interpreted as a string theory.

2.2 2d instantons and hitchin systems

we look now for classical euclidean supersymmetric congurations that preserve half su-
persymmetry. to this end we set  =  = 0 and look for solutions of the equations  = 0,

1here we use the same explicit example as in [13] in order to point out the analogies and dierences

between the two cases

4

i.e., from (2.3),

(cid:18) i
2g2 fw w 

i
2

[x i, x j ]ij(cid:19) c = 0 , dwx iic = 0 .

(2.4)

solutions of these equations that preserve one half supersymmetry are the following ones.
set x i = 0 for all i except two, for deniteness x i 6= 0 for i = 1, 2; remark that 12 is an
antisymmetric 8  8 matrix, and 2
12 = 1 and therefore its eigenvalues are i ( moreover
12 = 12). it is easy to show that there exists , with four independent components, such
that

12 = i,

1 = i2.

we replace this  in eq. (2.4).
x 1 + ix 2,
conditions to be satised in order to preserve one half supersymmetry are

it is convenient to introduce the complex notation x =
x = x 1  ix 2 = x. x, x are complex symmetric matrices. then the

fw w + g2[x, x] = 0,

dwx = 0,

(2.5)

it is easy to verify that, if non-trivial solutions to such equations exist, they satisfy the
equations of motion of the action (2.1). the action with  = 0,  = 0, x i = 0 for i = 3, . . . 8
can be normalized as follows

sinst =

2 z d2w tr(cid:18)xdwd w x  xdwd wx +

1
2g2 f 2

w w +

g2
2

[x, x]2(cid:19) .

(2.6)

it is elementary to prove that sinst vanishes in correspondence to solutions of (2.5).

3. heterotic stringy instantons and riemann surfaces

3.1 heterotic stringy instantons

we recall that n is even, n = 2n. we want to construct solutions of eqs. (2.5) that
interpolate between any two asymptotic string states (w = ) as the ones considered in
sec.2.1. it turns out that the right (heterotic stringy) strong coupling solutions of (2.5) are
of the type:

(3.1)
where x (b) = x  1 and x = diag(x1, . . . , xn). we construct the instanton that reduces
to it in the strong coupling limit in close analogy with [13, 14].

a  a(b) = 0 ,

x  x (b),

our purpose is to construct a symmetric matrix x and an antisymmetric connection
a that satisfy (2.5). let us start from the canonical n  n matrix m whose eigenvalues
coincide with those of x,

we map the problem from the cylinder to the disk: w  z = ew, and require zm = 0,
and therefore zai = 0 for each i = 0, . . . , n  1, after mapping . the matrix m denes
a branched covering of the cylinder c, which is a riemann surface with punctures, as
discussed at length in [13, 14, 15].

now we identify the eigenvalues of x with those of m . we diagonalize m

m = s m s1,

m = diag(x1, . . . , xn)

where

next we set

 = y1i<jn

(xi  xj) .

s = bq ,

(3.3)

(3.4)

where b = ps s = b. here tilde stands for transposition. one has q q = b1s sb1 = 1.

in other words we decompose s into the product of a complex symmetric matrix b and a
complex orthogonal matrix q.

as a consequence

ms = b1m b = q m q1

(3.5)

is a symmetric complex matrix. we choose ms as our starting point in the construction
of the instanton, in the same way as we used m in [13, 14]. at this point it would seem
that we have to accompany ms with a corresponding connection aa = qq1. however
one can prove that the latter identically vanishes. this follows from the fact that q and
q1 contain strictly fractional singularities in z, say (z  a)k/j with k, j relatively prime
integers, but never (z  a)l, with l positive integer. therefore, in the sense of complex
distributions, zq1 = 0.

now the complex orthogonal matrix q can be decomposed as follows

q = ho,

h = pqq .

(3.6)

as a consequence, h = h, oo = 1 and o o = 1. therefore o  o(n, r).
our complete ansatz for the instanton is dened by the couple x = y 1msy  1 and
a = y 1wy  1, where y = hl, and l is a complex orthogonal matrix. in particular
(3.7)

x = y 1msy  1 = l1o m o1l  1 .

since l is a complex orthogonal matrix, x is symmetric and a is antisymmetric, as desired.

6

the points where  vanishes, i.e. where two eigenvalues coincide, are branch points of
the covering dened by the matrix m . they are therefore characterized by a monodromy.
let us check that the solutions we propose are not aected by such monodromies, i.e. are
single-valued. notice that under a monodromy transformation around any point of the
basis cylinder, we have

b  b ,

q  q ,

h  h ,

s  s ,
where  is the monodromy matrix about the given point (one such monodromy matrix is,
for example, the matrix p introduced above).

therefore ms and x, as well as a, are single-valued provided l is. let us see how one

o  o ,

m  1 m  ,

can construct such an l.

in order for our ansatz to satisfy (2.5), the entries of the complex orthogonal matrix
l must be single-valued elds that satisfy eld equations of the wznw type, with delta-
function-type sources at the branch points. we have already discussed the existence of
solutions of such equations in [13, 14, 15]. we have seen that in the strong coupling limit
l tends to 1 outside an arbitrary small neighborhood of the branch points. therefore,
excluding a small neighborhood of the branch points, we can set

x = o xo1  1 ,

a = h1wh  1 = owo1  1

since, as we have seen, wq = 0. therefore in the strong coupling limit, ouside the branch
points, we recover a(b) and x (b) up to a gauge transformation.2

we also remark that eqs. (2.5) are invariant under orthogonal o(n ) transformations.
therefore the instantons solutions we have found are understood to be dened up to arbi-
trary orthogonal o(n ) transformations.

3.2 other branches

with the term strong coupling solutions we mean the solutions of (2.5) in which fw w = 0
and [x, x] = 0 separately. there are many other possible strong coupling solutions of (2.5)
beside (3.1). therefore it is important to understand why in this paper we limit ourselves
to (3.1). the strong coupling congurations split into two branches, just as the solutions
studied in naive strong coupling limit in sec.2.1. the rst branch is given, in the diagonal
representation, by

aw = a(b)

w = a   ,

x  x (b) = x  1 ,

(3.8)

where a and x are diagonal matrices. the second branch corresponds to congurations
(x (b), a(b)) in which a(b) = 0 and x (b) is a generic diagonal matrix (i.e. without two by
two identication of the eigenvalues as in (3.1). this classication closely parallels the one
found in section 2.1 in the naive strong coupling limit.

the strong coupling solutions (3.1) correspond to the intersection of the two branches.
in the same way as above we constructed the instantons corresponding to any strong

2of course, if o  o(n), o  1  o(n ).

7

coupling solution (3.1), we can construct instantons corresponding to any strong coupling
solution in the two branches. this has been done and will be reported elsewhere. however
a generic instanton in the two branches needs not lead in the strong coupling limit to the
heterotic string theory. the instantons in the intersection (i.e. the stringy instantons) do.
let us clarify what we mean by this. as is clear from [13, 14] and from the next
section, our aim is to expand the action about a given instanton solution and to extract
the strong coupling limit. the instanton is really stringy if the riemann surface it contains
(as a branched covering of the cylinder) is in accord with the string interpretation as
a scattering process, in the strong coupling limit. this requires that the corresponding
amplitude be proportional to g
, where  is the euler characteristic of the riemann
surface, as explained in the introduction. this factor can only come from a maxwell eld
theory on the covering of the cylinder, which, in turn, can only be a consequence of a
surviving part of the original gauge symmetry of the theory. we recall that in [13, 14] the
u (n ) gauge symmetry of the theory breaks down, in the strong coupling congurations
on the basis cylinder, to (u (1))n , and that this is the basis for the persistence of a u (1)
gauge symmetry on the covering in the strong coupling limit. in the instantons constructed
in the previous subsection, the strong coupling congurations (3.1) break down the gauge
symmetry o(n ) in such a way that a (o(2))n symmetry survives. this, as will be seen,
guarantees that a maxwell theory will survive on the corresponding covering in the strong
coupling limit. this is the reason why we limit ourselves in this paper to strong coupling
congurations (3.1) represented by x (b)s in which the eigenvalues are identied two by
two, i.e. are in the intersection of the two branches.

s

should we consider instead diagonal x (b)s in which all eigenvalues are dierent (generic
solutions of the second branch), any non-discrete gauge symmetry would be destroyed
in the strong coupling limit. this would not leave any room for a maxwell eld on the
covering, therefore such congurations cannot trigger a string interpretation. as for generic
solutions of the rst branch, they contain a non-vanishing background gauge potential. the
corresponding coverings may possibly be interpreted in terms of scattering of heterotic
strings with non-perturbative objects.

in conclusion, only in the intersection of the two branches a genuine heterotic string
interpretation of the strong coupling limit seems to be possible. that is the reason why we
called heterotic stringy the instantons corresponding to the intersection between the two
branches.

3.3 lifting to the spectral covering

following [14], we show now that the hmst in the strong ym coupling limit, can be lifted
to the covering  of the basis cylinder. to this end we rst rewrite the action in the
following form

1

s =

[x i , x j ]2  g2[x i , x][x i , x] + dwxd wx
c )  gt i[x i, ](cid:19) + idw(cid:27) ,

c dw+

4g2 (cid:0)fw w + g2[x, x](cid:1)2

+

1

g2
2

8

where i = 3, 4, ..., 8. we now expand the action around a generic instanton conguration
writing any eld  as

 = (b) + t + n  (b) +    + n ,

(3.9)

where (b) is the background value of the eld at innite coupling, t are the uctuations
along the cartan directions (for a and c) or the directions which commute with the
cartan generators (for x i and s), while n are the uctuations along the complementary
directions in lie algebra o(n ) and in the relevant representations. so, in particular,

at
w = ad

w, xid, d

where ad
components, while xin have 2n2 components each.

s, d

xit = xid  1 ,

s  1 ,
w  ,
c are diagonal n  n matrices. therefore for instance an

c   ,

t
s = d

t
c = d

(3.10)

w has 2n(n  1)

as for  the above splitting has a specic meaning. as a vector in the fundamental

representation of o(n ), we split it as follows

t =

02 (cid:18) 1

1(cid:19) ,

n =

12 (cid:18) 1

1(cid:19) ,

(3.11)

where 0, 1 are n-component vectors. this splitting is actually rather arbitrary: we could
replace 0 and 1 with any two linearly independent combinations of them. however the
nal result below would not change.

in the strong coupling we consider the above action on the base space c0, i.e. the
initial cylinder with a small disk cut out around any branch point (in other words we
insert a regulator dened by the radius of such disks). then the only eld with a non-
vanishing background part is x (b) = x  1 and its complex conjugate, since a(b) = 0
dressed with the orthogonal gauge transformation o, see (3.6). we can get rid of o by
means of a gauge transformation in the action. but we have to exercise some care because
in so doing we would o-rotate all the uctuations (both cartan and non-cartan). in order
to simplify things we will understand that the uctuations in (3.9) are dened up to the
gauge transformation o1.

now, since the value of the action on the background is zero and since the background
is a solution of the equation of motion, the expansion of the action starts with quadratic
terms in the uctuations. next we proceed, exactly, as in [14]. we use the same gauge
xing

g = dwa w + dwaw + g2([x, x] + [ x, x]) + 2g2[xi , xi ] = 0 ,

(3.12)

where d stands for the covariant derivative with respect to a. next we introduce the
faddeev-popov ghost and antighost elds c and c. they will be in the antisymmetric
representation of o(n), and will therefore be expanded as aw and a w. then we add to the
action the gauge xing term

sgf = 

1

4g2 z d2w g2

(3.13)

9

and the corresponding faddeev-popov ghost term

sghost =

1

2g2 z d2w c

g
c

c ,

(3.14)

where  represents the gauge transformation with parameter c.

at this point, to single out the strong coupling limit of the action, we rescale the elds

in appropriate manner.

and

aw = gat

c = gct + gcn ,

(3.15)

(3.16)

the reason why we scale out t
make a further comment on this point in the appendix.

c, and not 1, has been explained in section 2.1. we will

after these rescalings the action becomes

where ellipsis denote non-leading terms in the strong coupling limit,

and qn is the purely quadratic term in the n uctuations. they can be integrated over
and give exactly 1. although at rst sight everything looks like [14], there are several
subtle dierences.
in fact the derivation of (3.18) and the integration of qn are not as
straightforward as in [14]. in order not to interrupt the exposition we have collected the
relevant details in the appendix.

in conclusion, in the strong coupling limit (g  ), the action becomes

ssc =

1

 zc0

d2wntr(cid:2)wxi d wxi d + wxd w xd + id

s wd
s

+wad

w wad

w + wcd wcd(cid:3) + itwto .

(3.19)

the matrices which appear in this action are diagonal n  n matrices, while n is an n-
component vector. we can therefore rewrite the action in terms of the component modes
d = (1), . . . , (n):

ssc =

1

 zc0

d2w pn

p=1 hwxi

(p) wxi

(p) + i(s(p) ws(p) + (p)w(p))

+wa w(p) waw(p) + wc(p) wc(p)i .

(3.20)

10

at rst sight this looks like a theory of free elds on c0. however, as pointed out in [14], this
is not correct. the elds xi
(p), ... are not single-valued on the cylinder: by going around
a branch point some of the xi
(p) is mapped to some adjacent one, and this is precisely
the way a branch point describes a string interaction. the right interpretation was given
in [14]: every n-tuple of elds xi
(p) (s(p), (p), aw(p), c(p)) form a unique well dened eld
xi (s, , aw, c) on the riemann surface , which is the covering of the cylinder dened by
the background we have expanded about. at this point we have a well dened action on
all of , which is smooth also in correspondence with the branch points. therefore we can
remove without harm the regulator introduced before.

finally we can write the strong coupling action (3.20) as follows

m axwell,

s

het =

sc = s
s
het + s
 z

m axwell =

d2z(cid:16)z xiz xi + i(sz s + z )(cid:17)
d2z(cid:0)gz zzazzaz + zcz c(cid:1) .

(3.21)

(3.22)

(3.23)

in (3.22) a z (resp. z) factor has been absorbed in s (resp. ) which is a ( 1
(resp. (0, 1

2 )) dierential on  and the metric in the maxwell term is gz z = zz.

2 , 0)

summarizing, what we have obtained in this subsection is that the strong coupling
eective theory is given by the green-schwarz heterotic string action on the branched
covering worldsheet plus a decoupled maxwell theory on the same surface.

3.4 string amplitudes

the structure of the strong coupling theory is now parallel to the one obtained for the
matrix string theory in [14] and we can quickly draw our conclusions by simply taking
the results of [14, 15] and applying them to hmst. the riemann surface , generated by
the instanton, is taken to represent a heterotic string process. the surface has punctures
(i.e. the points of the covering that correspond to z = 0 and z = ) which represent the
incoming and outgoing strings: the length of each asymptotic string, i.e. the multiplicity
of the corresponding branch point plus one [15], is physically interpreted as its light-cone
momentum p+. naturally, in order to fully describe the asymptotic string states, we have
to introduce in the path integral the corresponding vertex operators. each vertex is con-
structed out of the x, ,  elds and, moreover, species the string transverse momentum.
since the vertices do not depend on the maxwell eld and ghosts, we can integrate them
out (the non-cartan modes have been integrated out above). since the action is free, the
integration produces a ratio of determinants, which turns out to be a constant. however
we have to take account of the zero modes for the elds that have been rescaled. the
rescaled elds on  (3.15) are

az  g az ,

az  g az ,

c  g c ,

c  g c .

(3.24)

11

as a consequence the maxwell partition function rescales too with a factor depending on the
zero modes. by counting the zero modes of the maxwell elds and ghosts we conclude,3 as
in [14], that (thanks to the maxwell partition function) the string amplitude corresponding
to  is proportional to g22hp, where h and p are respectively the number of handles and
punctures of . being the string coupling gs = g1, this multiplicative factor is exactly
what we need in order to correctly reproduce string interaction theory.

of course this is not the end of the story. in order to obtain the complete amplitude
we have to sum over all the instantons of the same topological type (h, p). let us call
v1, . . . , vk the vertex operators corresponding to k incoming and outgoing strings, and
insert them into the path integral. the genus h amplitude (in the strong coupling limit)
will schematically be:

hv1, . . . , vkih = g

s zm

(h,n)
n

dm z d[x, , a, c]v1 . . . vkeshet ,

(3.25)

integrating over m(h,p)

n means integrating over all distinct instantons which underlie the
given string process for xed n , that is to say with assigned incoming and outgoing strings
in ordinary string interaction theory m(h,p) is nothing but the
and string interactions.
moduli space of riemann surfaces of genus h with p punctures, a complex space of dimen-
sion 3h 3 + p. in hmst m(h,p)
is the same as in mst and we can simply summarize the
result obtained in [15]: m(h,p)
is a discrete slicing of the moduli space of riemann surfaces
of genus h with p punctures, every slice having complex dimension 2h  3 + p; in other
words h moduli are discrete in hmst; we have argued in [15] that when n   these
discrete parameters become continuous and the full moduli space of riemann surfaces is
recovered.

n

n

therefore we can say that for large n the strong coupling limit of hmst reproduces

the heterotic string interaction theory.

as pointed out in section 2, in the absence of wilson lines, this is the so(32) theory

compactied to nine dimensions on a circle of very small radius.

to obtain other heterotic string theories, one must introduce wilson lines b, which
at strong coupling become b  0b0. the latter term is lifted to the covering as
b  and accounts for the breaking of so(32) to some suitable subgroup. as remarked at
the beginning, with a standard choice of wilson lines, one can break so(32) to so(16) 
so(16), and relate the model to the ten-dimensional e8e8 string also broken to so(16)
so(16).

a. appendix

in this appendix we discuss the derivation of the strong coupling action (3.17) and the
integration of the qn therein. the problems we have to face are related to the presence
in the action of chiral fermions and to the absence in the hmst of half the supersymme-
try, compared to mst. in (2.1) all fermions appear quadratically, therefore they can be

3fermionic zero modes are absent if 2h + p  2 > 0

(at least formally) integrated and give an overall well dened fermion determinant, since
chiral anomalies from dierent multiplets cancel. if we were able to explicitly expand it in
powers of 1/g, we would start from this well dened expansion and then integrate also over
the bosons. unfortunately we do not know how to do that. therefore we can only carry
out the expansion directly in the action. however, if we do so, we break the abovemen-
tioned well-dened determinant to pieces and, in particular, we have to treat each chiral
species separately. this, in turn, leads to the longstanding problem of representing chiral
fermions in eld theory. various solutions have been proposed over the years: dynamical
mechanisms based on an innite number of avors [30] or on a generalized pauli-villars
regularization [31] (see the reviews [32, 33], and the references therein); in two dimensions,
in particular, the twistor formalism has been extensively used [34]. any of these choices
would require a long technical detour from the mainstream of our paper. therefore we
take a simpler course. we operate formally on the action, by making sure, however, that
our procedure leads at every step to a well-dened result.4 we warn the reader that a
complete conrmation of the correctedness of this way of proceeding would come from the
full expansion of the path integral in powers of 1/g. this is however beyond our present
ability.

we deal rst with the action term dw, which turns out to be the most delicate. let

us use (3.11), (3.10) and rewrite it as

s =

i

 z dw = iz (t + n)(cid:0)w  at
w  an
 z (cid:0)twt  tan
wt  tat
 z (cid:0)0w0  0 aw0 + 20ad

=

=

w(cid:1) (t + n)

wn  nat
w1 + (cid:1) .

i

i

wt + (cid:1)

(a.1)

dots represent non-leading terms in the strong coupling limit once the rescalings (3.15),
(3.16) are applied, so for simplicity we drop them right away. however it should be kept
in mind that the rescalings will become eective only later on. the matrix aw is n  n
antisymmetric. its elements are given by

(aw)ij = (an

w)2i,2j + (an

w)2i,2j+1 + (an

w)2i+1,2j + (an

w)2i+1,2j+1 .

looking at the last line of (a.1) a diculty is immediately evident. the second term
should simply not be there in the strong coupling limit, the rst term should end up in ssc
and the last term should account for the overall result of 1 in the integration of qn. but
rst and last term are intertwined. we have to disentangle them. in so doing we will solve
also the problem of the second term.

to this end let us, for simplicity, single out the grassmann path integral involving the

terms (a.1).

z d0d1 es .

4our wording is probably too poor in regard to fermion determinants: by well-dened we mean that a

determinant is a function rather than a section of some nontrivial line bundle.

13

in this path integral we introduce a delta function (0  ) where  is a fermionic eld
of the same type as 0 (i.e. a vector with n components, each of which is a real spinor in
the fundamental of so(32)), and integrate over . then we lift the delta function to the
exponent by means of a lagrange multiplier , which is itself a spinor of the same type as
0 and . the path integral is equivalent to the initial one, provided we integrate over the
modes of 0, 1,  and  and provided the action (a.1) is replaced by

s =

i

 z (0w0  aw0 + 2ad

w1  0 +  + ) .

now we redene 1 as

and obtain

s =

1 = 1 

1
2ad
w

 

1
2ad
w

aw0

i

 z (0w0 + 2ad

w1  0 + ) .

(a.2)

another way to get rid of the term 0aw0 is to integrate rst over the an
w degrees of
freedom and their conjugate: a well-known procedure to englobe linear terms in a gaussian
integration leads to a quartic term in 0, which is however vanishing.

summarizing, the path integral involving the  modes has become

z d0d1dd e

i

 r (0w0+2ad

w10+) .

(a.3)

it remains for us to rescale the elds according according to (3.15), (3.16) and, in addition,
 according to   1
g . as a consequence, all terms represented by dots, as well as the 0
term, will drop out in the strong coupling limit, leaving a zero volume integration constant.
we will comment about this later on. disregarding it for a moment, the  path integral in
the g   limit becomes

z d0d1d e

i

 r (0w02ad

w1) .

(a.4)

now the rst term is shued to ssc in (3.18), while the second term is exactly what we
need in order to get 1 from the path integration of qn. let us concentrate now on the
latter.

qn has the form

qn = q(matter)

it is understood that one must integrate qn over all the n modes, including 1 (remem-

ber (3.11)), and in addition over . in a very obvious way  can be written as t = 2 (cid:18) 1

so that

our aim is to show that the integration over the bosonic degrees of freedom in the path
integral of qn is exactly compensated for by the integration over the fermionic ones. as
for q(gauge)
the argument is the same as in [14] and will not be repeated here: the integral
over the gauge and ghost modes gives 1.

n

as for the matter part, integrating formally we obtain a ratio of determinants of a
and q. however there are here some subtleties that we have to explain. in q(matter)
the
operator a is a chiral operator: there is an asymmetry between n
c . the asymmetry
is measured in the same way we do for chiral anomalies: we compute the trace of the
square generators in the symmetric and adjoint representations of the lie algebra o(n ).
setting =1 the corresponding quantity in the fundamental representation, we get n + 2 in
the symmetric representation and n  2 in the adjoint. therefore the determinant that
comes from the formal integration over these modes is not well dened.

s and n

n

to see this point more clearly we need a further splitting of the non-cartan degrees of

freedom.

and n
and d

denotes the remaining non-cartan directions. it is clear that the components d


 are present only in the elds x i and s, not in the others.

now, computing the trace of the square generators in the symmetric and adjoint rep-
resentations, it is easy to see that the chiral asymmetry of (n + 2)  (n  2) = 4 between
the two representations is accounted for exactly by the modes d
 . but, calculating
the trace in the fundamental representation, we see that this asymmetry is exactly com-
pensated for by the 1 and  modes. (naturally these compensations are the same that
cooperate to cancel the chiral anomaly in the initial action (2.1)).

 and d

therefore the operator a, as it appears in (a.5) is non-chiral and the corresponding
determinant well dened. we can therefore proceed from now on as in [14]. what we
have to evaluate is the ratio (cid:0)(deta)16/(detq)8(cid:1)2n 2+n . the involved operators do not
have zero modes. the deta in the numerator should be understood as pdet(aa). but
aa = aa = q. therefore the net result of integrating over the non-cartan modes is
1. this is the result expected from supersymmetry in the absence of zero modes.

15

as for the overall jacobian arising from the rescalings (3.15), (3.16) and the one of
, it gives rise to a factor g60n. this factor in the g   limit is an innite factor that
must be related to the abovementioned zero volume factor due to integration over . such
innite and zero factors do not exist for nite g. they are an artifact of the g   limit.
therefore it is sensible to assume that they just compensate for each other and give a
constant which we can choose to be 1.

resuming now the considerations at the beginning of this section, we remark that
formal manipulations of the path integral have led us, nevertheless, to a blameless denition
of the integration over the non-cartan modes. as for the surviving cartan modes, lifted
to the covering they give rise to a well-dened theory, the heterotic superstring.

finally we would like to make a comment on the possibility, mentioned in section 2.1,
of an alternative strong coupling limit which would be obtained by scaling away all the 
degrees of freedom while keeping t
c. this would surprisingly lead to a type iia theory. we
have already ruled out above this possibility on the basis of some some simple arguments.
here we would like to strengthen the argument that the strong coupling limit should be
a chiral theory. this can be done by a request of anomaly matching condition similar to
t hoofts one [35]. the avor symmetry of our theory at g = 0 can be thought of as a
global so(8)r  so(8)l  so(32)l. suppose we gauge this symmetry (for instance, by
coupling s to a gauge potential c ij
w ijs, and so on); it is elementary to see that
the corresponding anomalies are reproduced in the heterotic strong coupling limit with
the same relative coecient, while they would not reproduced in the would-be iia strong
coupling limit.
