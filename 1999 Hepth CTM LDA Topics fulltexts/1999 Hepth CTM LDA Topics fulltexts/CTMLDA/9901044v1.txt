abstract

an important element in a model of non-singular string cosmology is a phase in which

classical corrections saturate the growth of curvature in a desitter-like phase with a linearly

growing dilaton (an algebraic xed point). as the form of the classical corrections is not well

known, here we look for evidence, based on a suggested symmetry of the action, scale factor

duality and on conformal eld theory considerations, that they can produce this saturation.

it has previously been observed that imposing scale factor duality on the o() corrections

is not compatible with xed point behavior. here we present arguments that these problems

persist to all orders in . we also present evidence for the form of a solution to the equations

of motion using conformal perturbation theory, examine its implications for the form of the

eective action and nd novel xed point structure.

1 introduction

einsteins theory of general relativity precipitated a revolution in cosmology, predicting

in a quantiable way a dynamical universe. however, extrapolating this evolution back to

very early times exposes a number of puzzles. firstly, to evolve to the universe we observe

today the early universe must be unnaturally smooth and at. these problems can be solved

by introducing an early phase of accelerated evolution, generically known as ination. but,

secondly, beyond these apparent ne tuning problems, the universe as we know it must have

a singularity of innite density in the past [1], indicating that general relativity itself is

incomplete.

our best current candidates for a unied theory of gravity and all other interactions

are the various string theories. these theories generically predict that in addition to the

elds of the metric tensor, gravity contains a scalar component called the dilaton, whose

vacuum expectation value also controls masses of particles and the strength of the various

gauge couplings. while the presence of a light dilaton was actually found to be damaging

to standard forms of ination based on the potential energy of a scalar eld [2], a radically

dierent scenario was proposed [3, 4] in which the kinetic energy of the dilaton eld drives

ination. further, the natural origin for such a phase lies in the perturbative domain of

string theory, a weakly coupled, very at universe. objections have been raised that this

origin is itself a form of ne-tuning, and while the situation is not yet completely clear, some

aspects of these objections have been answered or spawned interesting new speculations on

the question of initial conditions. nonetheless, this scenario, dubbed the pre-big-bang,

utilizes the dilaton as a uniquely natural inationary candidate, sidesteps the ambiguities

inherent in placing the origin of the universe in a near singular state and most interestingly

leads to possible observable signals [5].

the scenario begins with the observation that solutions to the lowest order equations

of motion for the metric-dilaton system come in duality pairs related by a symmetry of

string theory in cosmological backgrounds, scale factor duality (sfd). they consist of an

inationary branch in which the hubble parameter increases in time and which ends in a

singularity (the (+) branch) and a decelerated branch with decreasing hubble parameter
which begins in a singularity (the () branch). the pre-big-bang scenario consists of a
essentially empty universe beginning on a (+) branch which evolves to high curvature and

1

rapid expansion but instead of going all the way to a singularity, turns around and decelerates
into a () branch. this () branch can then be smoothly joined with a standard radiation
dominated friedmann-robertson-walker (frw) universe with constant dilaton, necessary

to be compatible with observational limits on the variation of gauge couplings and masses, at

least from the time of nucleosynthesis [6]. this combination provides a realistic cosmology in

which the high curvature phase joining the two branches, which we expect to be accompanied

by copious particle production, is identied with the big bang of the standard model.

to produce this joining of the two branches we will need to consider correction terms to

the lowest order action which may allow exit from the (+) branch inationary phase. this

has proved a frustrating enterprise, leading to this being called the graceful exit problem.

in [7] we generalized earlier specic no-go theorems [8] to show that the property required
of the additional sources is the ability to violate the null energy condition (nec) (+p  0,
where  is the eective energy density of the additional sources and p is the pressure). on

the negative side this rules out standard sorts of sources such as potentials, other scalar

elds, perfect uids with reasonable equations of state, etc. on the armative side this

points in the direction of quantum corrections which are known to be capable of violating

such energy conditions.

corrections to the lowest order action take the form of a dual series in two expansion
parameters. the rst is the string length scale s = . corrections in this parameter
become important in the regime of large curvature. these are classical corrections related

to the nite string size and are expected to play a role in regulating curvature growth. the

second is the dimensionless string coupling e = g2

string, where  is the dilaton expectation

value. these are genuinely quantum corrections since the power of e counts the number of

loops in the string worldsheet topology and they can, in principle, violate nec.

we recently presented an explicit model of a graceful exit [9], following a suggestion

[10], that o() classical correction could limit curvature growth, leaving the universe in a

de-sitter like phase (a xed point) with constant hubble parameter but a linearly growing

dilaton. since the dilaton controls the strength of quantum loop corrections, they will become

stronger, eventually providing the source of nec violation to complete the exit.

while it is possible the loop corrections could accomplish the graceful exit on their own, it

appears to be dicult to tune the theory to accomplish this. the xed point behavior seems

2

to be necessary to bridge naturally between the inationary (+) branch and the graceful exit.

with a xed point to rest in, changes in the initial conditions only change the value of the

dilaton at the time of entry to the xed point, but do not aect the behavior of the nal

exit phase.

although the existence of such a xed point is a question that should be answerable

from rst principles, as we explain in detail in the next section, our knowledge of the form

of these corrections of higher order in  is very limited. previous works simply selected

corrections that exhibited xed point behavior from a family of corrections compatible with

the few known properties of these corrections. but not all members of this family exhibit

this behavior. in this work we discuss evidence that classical corrections of higher order may

or may not assist the graceful exit by exhibiting attractive xed points, and nd evidence

for the position of the xed point.

2 eective string cosmology

2.1 general considerations

string theory eective action takes the following form,

1

16 z d4xghe(cid:16)l0 + 1

sef f =
l0 = r + ,

2lc(, g . . .)(cid:17) + . . .i

(2.1)

(2.2)

where g is the 4-d metric and  is the dilaton, the eective action is written here in
the string frame. lc contains the corrections to the lowest order 4-d action coming from
a variety of sources, but here we restrict ourselves corrections that are tree-level in the

string worldsheet, terms made up of covariant combinations of the massless elds and their

derivatives (the graviton g, the dilaton  and the antisymmetric tensor eld strength

h, which we here set to zero). as higher order corrections, they take the form of a series
expansion with expansion parameter  = 2

s, where s is the string length scale.

we are interested in solutions to the equations of motion derived from the action (2.1) of
the frw type with vanishing spatial curvature ds2 = n2(t)dt2 + a2(t)dxidxi and  = (t).
gelc
we include the corrections in the form of their energy momentum tensor t = 1g
,

g

3

which will have the form t 
source term arising from the variation by  equation, lc = 1

 = diag(, p, p, p). in addition we have another form of

gelc

1g



2

.

in terms of these sources the equations of motion are

2 h  3h 2 + 2h   1
3 h + 6h 2  3h  + 1

2

3h 2 + 1
2

2

2  3h  = 1
2 +  = 1
2   = 1

2e
2ep
2elc
,
 + 3h( + p) = lc

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

h = a/a. the explicit  dependence in these equations is an artifact of our attempt to

maintain consistency with earlier works. for the tree level classical corrections  itself will
be of the form e(. . .). so the corrections lc will appear in the equations of motion as
polynomials in h and  and possibly higher derivatives.

our knowledge of the form of these corrections is incomplete. eorts to x them by

requiring the action reproduce the string theory s-matrix elements [11] can determine only

some of the coecients of potential covariant terms in the action since others do not con-

tribute to the s-matrix or make contributions which overlap in form with those of other

terms [12]. for example, in [11] they x the contribution

lc =

k
2

(0rr + 1()4),

(2.7)

and nd 0 = 1 and 1 = 0, where k = 1, 1/2 for the bosonic and heterotic string respectively

(for the type ii string k = 0 and the corrections start at higher order). we will thus nd

it convenient to x our units such that k = 1. there are also determinations of other

contributions containing the antisymmetric tensor eld strength. our knowledge of higher

order corrections fades rapidly with increasing order.

but even (2.7) is ambiguous, as we can make modications to this correction (eld

redenitions) of the form,

sef f  sef f + smod
g +

16 z d4x gel0

g

1

gel0



! .

(2.8)

(2.9)

smod =

we have added to the action factors consisting of the lowest order equations of motion

multiplied by g and  which we will chose to be explicitly proportional to . since

4

the corrections to the lowest order equations of motion are also of order  for dimensional

reasons, this is consistent on the level of a truncated perturbation expansion in powers of

. more importantly, these modications are justied on the basis of the fact they dont

alter the on-shell scattering s-matrix and so have equal standing with correction (2.7) [12].

as we shall see, in spite of this equivalence they represent quite dierent eective actions

for evolving cosmologies.

explicitly (see [13, 14]) this becomes,
smod = 1

16 z d4xge(cid:26)(r +  

1
2

g(r + 22  ()2))g+

where we put

+ 2(r + 22  ()2)(cid:27),

g = k(a1r + a2 + a3g()2 + a4gr + a5g2)
 = k(b1r + b2()2 + b32).

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

explicitly evaluating the correction, we nd it can be expressed in terms of the following

tensor structures (after some integration by parts, use of the bianchi identity and setting

k = 1),

smod = 1

16 z d4xge(cid:26)c0rr + c1rr + c2r2 + c3()4+
+ c4r + c5r()2 + c6r2 + c72()2 + c8(2)2(cid:27),

(2.13)

(2.14)

with

c0 = 0

c1 = a1
a1
c2 =
2

+ a3  2b1

c3 = a2  2a4 + 2b2
c4 = a1  a2
c5 =

2

c6 =

c7 =

c8 = 3a5  4b3.
5

(2.15)

we have included the c0 term even though it is unchanged by eld redenitions so we have a

list of all independent covariant tensors at this order. as observed in [11, 13], freely varying

the a and b parameters results in free variation of the non-zero c parameters subject to the

single constraint

c2 + c3 + c7 + c8 = c5 + c6.

(2.16)

we should remark that the reemergence of the ()4 term does not contradict the calculation
(2.7) since its contribution to the s-matrix is oset by the other terms introduced.

these shifts are useful to exhibit forms of the action which have equations of motion

containing at most second derivatives. higher derivative equations of motion are dicult to

handle, since the extra initial conditions which must be imposed suggest that weve allowed

extra modes into the problem. practically, these extra modes lead to numerical instabilities

and runaway solutions. this physical nature of this problem is lucidly discussed in [15]

by analogy with the radiation reaction on an accelerating point charge, which can produce

similar runaway solutions. the equation of motion becomes third order in derivatives, ap-

parently introducing a new degree of freedom, the choice of initial acceleration. however,

the initial value of the acceleration must be adjusted exactly to cancel an exponentially run-

away solution, which should be regarded as unphysical. so in spite of an apparent increase

in the number of higher derivative initial conditions, the restriction to physical behavior

will eliminate them. in our case of higher derivative corrections, it is practically impossible

to nd these special initial conditions with any exactitude, and even if we could, numerical

instability would render the solution useless after a short time. these problems can also

be dealt with on a perturbative level by a prescription called reduction of order, in which

higher order derivatives coming from the corrections are replaced by forms obtained by dif-

ferentiating the lowest order parts of the equations of motion [15]. this leads to modied

equations of motion which formally dier from the original by truncation of terms containing

higher powers of the perturbative expansion parameter . however, the modied equations,

while of lower order, are often extremely complicated and we will not explore this approach

further. here we will simply explore only those forms of corrections which do not introduce

higher derivatives.

as we shall see later, making these shifts, while formally preserving the action to o(),

have a drastic eect of the behavior of solutions, not only in the region of xed points,

6

causing xed points to move or even cease to exist, but making qualitative changes in the

perturbative regime. our knowledge of the form of the corrections at this point is not

sucient to answer the most basic questions about the behavior of the solutions. so we need

other information to constrain them further.

the existence of the inationary (+) branch solutions can be traced to a symmetry of

the lowest order action [16], scale factor duality (sfd), which can be extended to a larger

symmetry o(d, d) in the presence of the antisymmetric tensor [14]. the origin of sfd lies

in a canonical transformation on the string world sheet and since the worldsheet elds will

have this symmetry, if we could untangle the elds relationships with the redened and

renormalized elds in the eective action at a given order, we would see the symmetry

realized in the corrections, perhaps in a non-trivial way [14]. so it is tempting to try to

use this symmetry to extract information about the unknown parts of the higher order

corrections. this subject has already been extensively explored by maggiore [13] and many

of the following results were originally reported there. here we conrm them independently

in a dierent setup and make some additional observations.

recall sfd in its simplest (isotropic) form in 4 dimensions,

(t)  (t)  6 log(a(t))

a(t) 

1

a(t)

.

(2.17)

we see that in terms of the variable (t) = (t)  3 log(a(t)), sfd takes the simple form
(2.18)

(2.19)

(2.20)

(2.21)

(2.22)

(2.23)

(t)  (t)
h(t)  h(t).

the equations of motion become

= 0

 3h 2   + 
  2 h + 2h  = 0
  3h 2  
+ 2 = 0
3h + (  )  +  = 0,

where  = e,  = elc and  = e(p + lc). in addition to a slightly simplied form,
this version has the advantage that the terms of each equation are uniformly even or odd

7

under sfd. so a source can easily be inspected for sfd invariance,  and  should be even
and  should be odd. these conditions can be guaranteed by showing that lc can be written
in a form that is explicitly sfd even. generally this will require integrations by parts to

eliminate total derivatives that dont have this property. for example the lowest order part

of the action can be explicitly displayed in an sfd invariant form as

 = z dte (

3h 2
n

n

+ lc) = z dte lef f (h, , h, . . .).

(2.24)

2.2 explicit examples

in this section we look at explicit examples of evolution with various forms of constraints

imposed on the corrections. we remark that many of the interesting properties of these

solutions can be deduced without explicit numerical integrations. in the no higher derivative
case the constraint equation (2.20) is an algebraic equation in the ( , h) phase plane. so
solutions will be conned to ow on this curve. the location of the xed points can be

found by intersecting this curve with the curve dened by taking one of the other equations

of motion and putting the higher derivatives to zero. while this might seem to lead to more

equations than unknowns, as observed in [10], the conservation equation (2.23) is actually

a linear relation between the other three equations in a xed point, reducing the system to

two equations in two unknowns and allowing for the generic existence of xed points.

to map landmarks in the ( , h) plane, we solve the constraint equation (2.20) for ,

 = q3h 2 + .

(2.25)

the sign choice here corresponds to our designations of (+) and () branch respectively.
so the vacuum solutions ( = 0) will appear as straight lines  = 3h. explicitly as a

function of time the expanding vacuum solutions are,

 = 

1
t

h = 

1
3t

.

(2.26)

the upper sign corresponds to the (+) solution (t < 0) and the lower to the () (t > 0).
the change from one branch to another happens along the line  = 0. and, as discussed in
detail in [7, 9], the line  = 2h or these variables  = h, is where the bounce (the change

from expansion to contraction or vice versa) takes place in the einstein frame (a conformally

8

related frame in which the gravitational coupling is held constant). we are currently working

in the string frame in which the string scale s is a constant. it is the crossing of this line

that is associated with nec violation.

we will also nd the solutions will sometimes encounter singularities at nite values of 
and h. to see where these come from we solve the equations of motion (2.21) and (2.22) for
 and h in terms of lower derivatives. without higher order corrections this is trivial, but
2 h etc. this
when higher order corrections are added  and  can contain terms like h 2, 
means solving for  and h can lead to expressions containing denominators. clearly if the
solution approaches the curve corresponding to the vanishing of one of these denominators

the higher derivatives will go to innity and the integration must be stopped. the curves

also generally mark changes in the ow direction on the constraint curve. so we will also

plot curves indicating the vanishing of these denominators.

to begin with the simplest case we will also impose the requirement that the action

produces equations of motion having at most second derivatives in the variables a and .

this limits us to four possible tensor structures in the correction.

lc = k(a ()4 + b r2

gb + c (r 

1
2

gr)   + d 2() ()2)

(2.27)

where rgb = rr  4rr + r2 is the gauss-bonnet term. we can consider
putting other constraints on this correction, for example, the requirement that it contain the

riemann squared term of (2.7) is

b =

1
2

.

(2.28)

this is because the riemann squared term is not altered by a eld redenition. the require-

ment that the rest of the terms come from a eld redenition of the form (2.9) from the

basic correction (2.7) is,

a + b + c/2 + d = 0.

(2.29)

before we look at the consequences of imposing sfd on our sources we look at two
examples of explicit evolutions of this type in the ( , h) phase plane. fig. 1a shows the
case a = 1/2, b = 1/2, c = 0, d = 0, the case examined in [10] and used as part of the
foundation for a model of graceful exit in [9]. the (+) branch vacuum ows into a xed
point located at (0.445, 0.617) after undergoing a branch change. fig. 1b shows the case

a = 1/2, b = 1/2, c = 2, d = 1. this is the form of corrections proposed in [14]. it
has the remarkable property of being sfd (indeed o(d, d)) invariant, but with the form of

the duality (2.17) modied by corrections of order  and with terms of higher order in 

truncated. so it does not show the symmetry of (2.17) and furthermore the (+) branch

solution ows away from the region of branch change and does not encounter a xed point.

the important thing to note here is that these corrections are related to the correction

(2.7) by a eld redenition (check (2.29)) yet show very dierent behavior. not only are

they dierent in terms of xed point behavior, very close to the (+) branch vacuum the

curves are turning in opposite directions.

to consider the eects of imposing (2.17) on the correction, we consider a correction with

completely general a, b, c, d. this adds to the quadratic terms in (2.24) the correction,

lc = (cid:26) 3 (27 a + 8 b + 9 c + 27 d) h 4

(2.30)

the qualitative question of whether this action has solutions which turn towards the

branch change region ( < 0) as in fig. 1a or away ( > 0) as in fig. 1b is easily answered by

inserting the (+) branch vacuum solution (2.26) into (2.27) (since  comes from the variation

by n, the  contribution is proportional to the above form of the action). numerically, we

nd the turning direction is determined by the sign of,

0 = 83.5692a + 6.3094b + 11.1962c + 63.1769d.

(2.31)

so if 0 < 0 we expect the solution to turn towards the branch change and conversely. also,

because the constraint equation contains only terms of degree two and degree four when

we restrict ourself to only the o() corrections, we see the solution can have at most one

nonzero intersection with every radial line through the origin. so once it turns one way it

will not turn back.

the requirement of sfd symmetry can now be imposed by forcing the action to be sfd

invariant. this is done by setting the coecients of the h 

3

and h 3  terms to zero, i.e.

d = 2a
c = 4a 

4
9

b.

11

(2.32)

we then checked an observation [13] that these corrections fail to satisfy sfd in an

anisotropic background, since allowing three dierent hubble constants in three directions

hx, hy and hz will create many more sfd odd terms which must be set to zero. so

we simultaneously relaxed the no higher derivatives conditions, which allows for the nine

dierent tensor structures not related by bianchi identities shown in (2.14). the equations

become enormously more complicated, and since it is not clear which integrations by parts

should be performed to exhibit the action in sfd invariant form (if indeed this is possible)
we derived the ,  and  expressions and inspected them for the correct sfd symmetry.

we found a two parameter family of corrections which did not break sfd invariance. in

terms of the cs of (2.14), the remaining seven coecients of the sfd invariant corrections

can be parameterized in terms of the values of c3 and c8,

c0 = 0

c1 = 4c3  c8
c2 = c3 + c8/2
c4 = 4c3  c8
c5 = 2c3
c6 = c8

c7 = 2c3  c8/2.

(2.33)

the condition c0 = 0 makes this incompatible with the calculated result (2.7). further, the

only combination of the curvature squared terms not giving rise to higher derivative equations
of motion is the gauss-bonnet combination, which in turn requires 4c0 = 4c2 = c1, so there
are no nontrivial members of this family without higher derivative equations of motion.

with these cautions, we still might hope that the family of corrections given by (2.32)

might give some clue as to the nature of the correct corrections, and they might indicate

that the solutions coming out of the (+) branch vacuum tend to wind up in xed points.

numerical examinations showed this was not the case. we present a representative family

of such evolutions in fig. 2. notice the enhanced symmetry over fig. 1. in fig. 2a,d we see
an attractive and repulsive xed point on the  axis at  negative and positive respectively.
however they lie on a portion of the constraint curve disconnected from the vacuum part.

in fig. 2b,c the vacuum part of the constraint forms a closed loop, and we could hope it

performs the graceful exit on its own. but this loop is cut by the singularity curve where

the integration must be halted.

2.3 naive sfd is a bad thing

one conclusion might be that this shows that the order  corrections are insucient to

describe the behavior and we need to know the higher order corrections as well. this may

be, and indeed the xed points generally occur at regions of the phase space where the order

 corrections are on the same order as the lowest order terms. but there is an even more

fundamental obstruction. we will now show that sfd in its naive form (2.17) is generically

incompatible with good xed point behavior.

first of all we note another fundamental symmetry of our equations of motion, time

13

reversal invariance

t  t
(t)   (t)
h(t)  h(t).

(2.34)

this tells us that if we have a solution curve in the ( , h) plane, we can reect it through
the origin and reverse the time ow to obtain another solution. putting this together with
sfd (2.19), which says we can also reect solutions across the  axis we see solutions can
also be reected across the h axis and time reversed. this in turn tells us the xed points

also occur in pairs reected across the h axis with one repulsive and one attractive as a

result of the time reversal.

now we repeat an observation [10] that the lowest order action (2.24) is independent of

 = log(a(t)), and depends only on its derivatives, all explicit  dependence having been
absorbed into . we presume this independence will persist in the higher order corrections.

this allows us to drop the rst term of the variation,

 = z dte " lef f

(2.35)

(2.36)

since the quantity in brackets is just proportional to the  equation of motion (2.21) with an
overall factor of e  and it is clearly a total derivative, we can integrate it to get a constant

of motion [10],

where

q = z dte (  2 h + 2h ) = e (   2h),

(h, , h. . . .) = e

z dte 

(2.37)

(2.38)

is a function beginning at third degree in derivatives with the o() corrections. we will

nd the this conserved constant will allow us to make some statements about the location

of xed points.

14

putting q = 0 in (2.37) leads to another constraint type equation for the solution,
  2h = 0. this clearly conicts at lowest order with the constraint (2.20), so this is not
a possibility for solutions originating near the vacuum. considering a solution approaching

a xed point, we have   2h  constant. if  > 0 then clearly the decreasing exponential
in (2.37) will force q to be zero, so the only remaining possibility is   0 and   2h = 0
in the xed point. so the diverging exponential is cancelled by the decrease in   2h, but
now it would appear we have another algebraic condition to impose on a xed point, raising

the question again of whether ne tuning is necessary to get a xed point. but we can show

this is not the case. the content of the equation (2.21) is equivalent to

i1 = e

" d

dt

(e  lef f

d2

dt2 (e  lef f

) + . . .# = 0.

(2.39)

the integrated condition   2h = 0 which we must enforce at xed points is proportional
to

i2 = e "(e  lef f

h

) 

d
dt

(e  lef f
 h

) + . . .# = 0.

(2.40)

in a xed point, the time derivatives of the partial derivatives of lef f vanish, since they
are functions of h,  which are becoming constant and derivatives higher than the rst will
vanish in a xed point. so the only non-vanishing parts will come from the time derivatives

of the e , so i1 =  i2. so at least in the case where  6= 0 in the xed point, the vanishing
of the equation of motion i1 implies the vanishing of   2h.

putting these arguments together shows that xed points at  < 0 are attractive in the
sense that generic (q 6= 0) solutions will ow into them. conversely, solutions at  > 0

are repulsive in the sense that solutions ow out of them. we have not found an argument
classifying the behavior at xed points at  = 0. in addition, we have the possible existence
of q = 0 solutions which evade these constraints. we shall have more to say about these

when we confront one in section 3.

now we are ready to discuss the possibility of a solution coming out of the (+) branch

vacuum and ending in a rst xed point encountered on the constraint curve for an sfd

invariant action. given the symmetries of sfd invariant actions we can draw three possible

pictures of such a solution and its sfd/time reversed partner, a solution owing out of a

xed point and into the () branch vacuum fig. 3. in fig. 3a the xed point is at   0.

16

therefore, as we have argued, this xed point is repulsive, and a solution will ow out of

it rather than in. given that a solution is also owing out of the (+) branch vacuum, they

must meet at some intermediate point. this point will not be a regular xed point since

we presume the cross marks the rst xed point. the only other possibility is that it is a

singularity of the type discussed in [9, 13], which is manifested in the equations of motion
h and  in
terms of lower order derivatives, and which we have indicated by drawing such a curve. so

by a zero in the denominator of the expression for the highest order derivatives,

this case leads to singular behavior rather than xed point behavior.

in the second case, fig. 3b the problem is a little more subtle. here we have put the rst
xed point at  < 0, so it is attractive, but something peculiar is clearly going on where the
two solutions cross. we have two solutions leaving the same ( , h) point, when we would
expect that the value of  and h would uniquely specify initial conditions. this is because
rst, we have presumed that equations are at most second order in derivatives. second, the

variables a(t) and (t) do not appear explicitly in the equations of motion. in fact, this
situation is the same as the singularity in the rst case. the expressions for h and  take
the indeterminate form 0/0 at this point. so the curve corresponding to the vanishing of

the denominators of these expressions also passes through this point, and higher derivatives

go to innity in the neighborhood of such points. numerical simulations are wildly unstable

passing through there, and we regard it as physically unstable as well.

it might be objected that this looks like the behavior at the origin. this is indeed possible
if this crossing point is also a  = 0 xed point, like the origin. in this case the solutions
dont actually cross, but just asymptotically approach this point. this is the boundary

behavior of both of the previous cases when the xed points are allowed to approach each

other. this is an interesting place for a xed point, it is mapped into itself by a combination
of sfd and time reversal and so is both a (+) and () branch solution simultaneously.

we now discuss briey the possiblity of placing the xed point at  = 0, fig. 3c, the
only possibility that would allow us to retain both simple sfd (2.17) and good xed point

behavior. to do this we need to examine the equations of motion with all derivatives higher
than the rst set to zero, and with  = 0. a little thought will show that the only terms in
the action that can contribute to these reduced eoms are

z dte (

3h 2
n

+ c1

h 4
n3 + c2

h 6
n5 + . . .),

17

(2.41)

where the dependence on n(t), the lapse factor, is dictated by time reparameterization in-
variance. performing the variation with respect to n, as in (2.20), and with respect , as in

(2.22), and setting n = 1, we get the following,

3h 2 + 3c1h 4 + 5c2h 6 + . . . = 0

3h 2 + c1h 4 + c2h 6 + . . . = 0.

(2.42)

(2.43)

so we see there are no non-trivial  = 0 xed points at order  (allowing us at most the
power h 4). at o(2) it would seem to be possible. but we have not classied covariant

tensor structures at this order and have no results comparable to (2.7). even so we have

tried to introduce sfd invariant corrections of the form expected at o(2) and while we can
position a xed point at  = 0 we have found no cases where it well behaved and connected
to the vacuum. this should be expected, since this case be looked at as a limiting case of the

two previous cases, where the action is manipulated to allow the two xed point to approach

each other. since the previous cases exhibit pathologies, they should probably be expected

to persist in the limit, but we dont regard this as a rigorous argument.

to summarize, we have shown that good xed point behavior and sfd with eoms con-
taining derivatives at most of order two require xed points at  = 0, which in turn seems
to be dicult to achieve.

on the other hand, it is not dicult to nd good xed point behavior (as in [10]) if

sfd is broken. so to sum up, perversely we have the situation where imposing a string

theoretical notion (sfd) on possible classical corrections seems to create diculties for

achieving another string theory notion, that nite size string eects will saturate curvature

growth.

there are several dierent conclusions to be drawn. one is simply to accept these conclu-

sions and retain faith in both the simplest form of sfd and curvature saturation. perhaps if

and when we can determine the correction to all orders it will exactly solve (2.43) allowing
a  = 0 xed point and shed pathologies. a second is the suggestion of [13], that we must
consider the contribution of the massive string modes, which may help to saturate curvature

growth. a third direction lies in a modication of the form of duality. as discussed in [16],

the source of sfd is a classical symmetry involving the exchange of winding and momentum

modes on the string world sheet, so at this level the dilaton does not participate in sfd at

all, since the dilaton only enters the theory at the quantum level. the non-trivial transfor-

18

mation of the dilaton comes at the level of the eective action, where we are working with

renormalized elds, which mix the dilaton with the scale factor. working to higher orders

in the corrections, one should expect additional renormalizations and hence corrections to

the form of sfd. this expectation was exploited in [14] to actually x the form of the action

and correction at o(), based on correct order by order cancellation of non-o(d, d) invariant

terms. as we have seen, this form of correction does not lead to xed point behavior (fig.

1b). but as we will see in the next section, it is close to the region of parameter space that
admits xed points without sfd. further, considering (2.22) we see that the source  has to
be at least of the same order as h 2 or 
this suggests that rather than simply conclude sfd works against xed point behavior,

, so the corrections cannot be small in a xed point.

2

we will require more knowledge of higher order corrections and/or of the form scale factor

duality takes in the higher order eective action.

2.4 the distribution of fixed points

since at this level sfd does not lead to interesting conclusions regarding the xed point

behavior, we return to the general form of corrections (2.27) and simply ask the question,

what region of the (a, b, c, d) parameter space for the corrections leads to good xed point

behavior and where are the xed points located? since this is a four dimensional space we

also impose the conditions (2.28) and (2.29), reducing us to a two parameter space (a, d).

to nd these xed points one should be careful not only to check algebraically that the

xed points exist but that they are reachable from solutions beginning near the (+) branch

vacuum. to do this we run numerical integrations from initial conditions near the (+) branch

vacuum and examine the solutions for xed point behavior at late time. in fig. 4a we have

placed a dot on a grid where an (a, d) selection leaves to good xed point behavior. we

have also marked the line corresponding to the condition (2.31). as expected, there is no

good xed point behavior to the right of this line, since the solutions initially veer from the
vacuum away from branch change, hence towards  > 0 where we nd only unstable xed
points. but good xed point behavior almost saturates the region to the left.

we have also marked with crosses the corrections corresponding to the  corrections used

to produce xed point behavior in [10, 7, 9] inside of the region of good xed parameters,

and also the parameters corresponding to the corrections of [14], whose evolution is plotted

in fig. 1b, which lies outside of this region. this form of the corrections is perhaps the

best motivated form of the corrections, coming from an exact but truncated form of o()

modied duality. it is discouraging that it is outside the region of good xed point behavior,

but encouraging to note that it is not far away, suggesting higher order corrections could

easily modify its behavior.

in fig. 4b we plot the locations of the resulting xed points in the ( , h) plane and
the location of the xed point used in [10, 7, 9]. we nd that the good xed points are

all located in a wedge bounded by   0 and h   . the rst boundary is easy to
understand, since we have just shown that the stable xed points must be located at   0.
the second is harder to understand. but we do observe that the line h =   is just the line

where the scale factor undergoes a bounce in the einstein frame, and producing this bounce
requires the sources to violate the null energy condition ( + p  0) [7, 9]. as these sources
represent classical string corrections which are not expected to violate nec, it is possible

these constraints contain part of that condition.

20

3 conformal field theories

we have seen that investigations of the behavior of solutions including only o() correc-

tions leads to, at best, ambiguous conclusions about their xed point behavior. since the

classical equations of motion for the background elds of the string are derived from the

requirement that they preserve conformal invariance on the string worldsheet [17], directly

constructing a conformally invariant background would give a solution to all orders in ,

even without knowledge of the form of the corrections. while there is a large literature

of exact cosmological solutions [18] (coming, for example, from gauged wzw models), all

exhibit either extreme anisotropy or are supported by other elds in addition to the graviton

and the dilaton. so they are not particularly relevent to this scenario. we will take a more

naive and non-rigorous approach to constructing a background which we hope will at least

have properties in common with a conformally invariant background.

recalling the classical action for the bosonic string,

s =

1

4 z d dhg(x)x x  + r(2)(x)(x)i ,

(3.1)

where  and  are coordinates and  is the metric on the string worldsheet, x  and g are

the spacetime coordinates and metric, r(2) the worldsheet curvature and  is the dilaton.
with g =  = (, +, +, . . .) this leads to a conformally invariant theory in critical
dimensions where the reparameterization ghosts cancel the contribution to the central charge

of the bosonic elds x . in the following we ignore issues related to the central charge of the

model, expecting it can also be cancelled by the addition of other sources that are inert,

in the sense of not aecting the other conclusions we draw. we introduce a nontrivial

background in the above by assuming

(x) = p x 0 = p t,

(3.2)

where p is a constant, giving a dilaton varying linearly in time. we also add to the at space

action ((3.1) with g = ) the term,

ok(z, z) = xi>0

e2kx 0

x i(z, z)x i(z, z).

(3.3)

this leads to an action with a total background metric of frw form with a(t) = 1 + e2kt,
interpolating between at space and a de-sitter form like our expected xed point solutions.

21

but we will need to insure that the addition of (3.3) to the action hasnt spoiled conformal

invariance.

a rst step in this direction is to check that quantum eects do not change the classical

scaling dimension of (3.3). a standard framework for doing this falls under the name of

conformal perturbation theory (see, for example, [19]). the energy momentum tensor for

the at space action (3.1) with the linear dilaton ansatz is,

tzz = 

1

2  zx 0zx 0 xi>0

zx izx i + p 2

z x 0! ,

(3.4)

where we have used conformal invariance to put the world-sheet metric into the conformal

gauge (z z = zz = 1, zz = z z = 0). there are also exactly parallel formulae for the

anti-holomorphic parts (z), which decouple from the holomorphic parts.

the requirement that ok transform as a conformal tensor is just,

ok(z, z)   f

z!h   f
 z!

h

ok(f (z), f (z)).

(3.5)

since we require the action to be an invariant, we want h = h = 1 to oset the scaling of

the integration measure dzdz. since tzz is the generator of conformal transformations, it

can be shown that (3.5) requires the following singularity structure in the operator product

expansion,

tzz(z)ok(w, w) =

h

(z  w)2ok(w, w) +

1

(z  w)

wok(w, w) + non  singular.

(3.6)

as usual this can be related to a normal ordered product by contracting operators as specied

by wicks theorem and using the following mnemonic for the propagators,

< x (z)x (w) >=  log(z  w).

(3.7)

this is a mnemonic in the sense that it correctly represents the short distance behavior of

the propagator and the operators are to be regarded as normal ordered in the sense that we

do not include divergent contractions of operators with the same argument.

so the expression corresponding to the holomorphic part of the ith component of the left

hand side of (3.6) becomes,



1

2 (cid:16)zx 0(z)zx 0(z)  zx i(z)zx i(z) + p 2

z x 0(z)(cid:17) e2kx 0(w)wx i(w)

(3.8)

22

the contractions are easily carried out because of the simple behavior of the exponential

under contractions. the result is,

e2kx 0(w)

(z  w)2 (cid:16)zx i(z)  k(p + 2k)wx i(w)(cid:17) +

e2kx 0(w)
(z  w)

if we insert the taylor expansion, zx (z) = wx (w) + (z  w)2
this as,

2kzx 0(z)wx i(w)

(3.9)

wx (w) . . ., we recognize

(1  k(p + 2k))ok(w)

+

(z  w)2

wok(w)
(z  w)

+ non  singular.

(3.10)

comparing this with (3.6) we identify ok as a conformal tensor of dimension 1k(p +2k),
so we can nontrivially satisfy the requirements of conformal invariance by setting p = 2k.
next to make contact with , the dilaton in our eective action, we compare our equations

of motion with those of [17]. we conclude that 2 = . reading o the space-time metric

and dilaton,

(t) = 2p t

p = 2k
a(t) = 1 + e2kt

k

h(t) =

1 + e2kt
(t) = 4k  3h(t)

(3.11)

a sample of such an evolution is given in fig. 5a. it is unusual in light of our previous

results. its xed points sit beyond the line h =   where the einstein frame bounce requires

nec violation, so we perhaps should not expect solutions originating near the vacuum to
ow into this xed point. secondly, it is owing out of a xed point at  < 0, the opposite
of the expected behavior, as we discussed in section 2.3. so we expect that if it is in fact a

solution to an eective action, we will nd it is a q = 0 solution.

to try to understand the implications of such a solution on the form of the eective action

we construct the most general eective action not involving higher derivatives and attempt

to x the coecients by demanding this solution solve the eoms. we took the action to be

of the form,

 = z dte l(h(t), (t), n(t))
cn,ih(t)i (t)ni/n(t)n1,
l = xn,i

where the sum is over even values of n. as before, the power of the lapse factor n(t) is

dictated by time reparametrization invariance. this is the most general action that can be

produced by covariant tensor corrections that do not introduce higher derivatives. we can

we then x c2,2 = 3, c2,1 = 0 and c2,0 = 1 reecting our knowledge of the lowest order
action and add a nite number of terms with even n, insert (3.11) into the resulting equations

of motion and attempt to solve the resulting linear system for the coecients cn,i. at the

level n = 4 we nd no solutions. but adding the n = 6 terms gives a one parameter family

of solutions and adding n = 8 an even larger family of solutions. and this is in spite of the

fact we get many more equations than free parameters.

a hopeful conclusion is that we have done something right, and the form of (3.11) is well

suited to solution by relatively lower orders in expected forms of the eective action. but

24

closer examination of the resulting equations of motion showed that when the initial condition

appropriate to the solution (3.11) are inserted the resulting equations become degenerate,

and we dont have enough dynamical equations to reconstruct (3.11). in particular, both of

the dynamical equations (3.14) and (3.15) become (t) = 3 h(t).

again a hopeful conclusion is that this is evidence for the special nature of (3.11). but

in fact this can be seen to be true of any q = 0 solution. referring to (2.36), we see that

the conserved quantity for our action ansatz can be written,

q = e  l
h

,

(3.16)

so the q = 0 condition becomes lh = 0. so the lower order part in (3.14) becomes identically
zero. the lower order part in the second dynamical equation is, in terms of the action (we

also set n(t) = 1),

l  

l
 

= xn,i

cn,ih(t)i (t)ni xn,i

(n  i)cn,ih(t)i (t)ni.

combining this with (3.13),

we see,

(n  1)cn,ih(t)i (t)ni = 0,

xn,i

l  

l
 

= xn,i

icn,ih(t)i (t)ni = h

l
h

.

(3.17)

(3.18)

(3.19)

so, in fact, the q = 0 condition, lh = 0 causes the dynamical equations to become homo-
geneous equations in the higher derivatives. since a homogeneous system does not have a

unique non-zero solution, we have lost the ability to recover the time dependence of (3.11)

from the equations of motion.

while this disturbing and unexpected, it has another interesting implication. any point
on the trajectory can be regarded as a xed point, since ( , h) = constant trivially satises
the eoms (3.14) and (3.15) by virtue of the vanishing of the lower derivative contributions.

in other words because of this degeneracy of the eoms, instead of having isolated xed points

we have curves of xed points.

furthermore, although the cft trajectory occupies only a nite segment in the ( , h)
phase space, looking at the situation from the view point of the eoms this is only part of the

story. consider the equation (3.13) which is just a polynomial in  and h. since it vanishes
on the segment dened by (3.11) it follows that (3.13) contains a linear factor which is just
the equation dening the segment, explicitly +3h(t)+4k. since this linear factor vanishes
on the entire innite line containing the segment we nd this constrain equation is valid on
the entire line. similarly, since the quantity lh = 0 must be satised on the segment it must
also be satised on the entire line. so the previous arguments can be seen to hold on the

entire line. so we have, in fact, have an innite line of xed points.

now consider the time reversed solution, clearly it also a q = 0 trajectory, since when

    and h(t)  h(t) we have lh   lh since it only contains terms of odd degree.

all of the foregoing apply to it also, so it can also be extended to an innite line of xed

points. we have illustrated these extended lines in fig. 5b.

returning our attention to the solution coming from the (+) branch vacuum where the

equations of motion are generically nonsingular, we observe that it is between two lines of
xed points. the points at  > 0 are repulsive and the solution cannot ow into them or
cross them. but those at  < 0 are attractive and make a large target of future attractors.
so the (+) branch solution may either ow to innity or singularity between the lines or

26

ow to one of the  < 0 xed points. the choice between these alternatives depends on the
exact form of the eective action. as we have stated, requiring (3.11) to be a solution of the

eective action to a given order does not x the coecients in the eective action but only

constrains them. we illustrate the situation in fig. 6. here we have tted an eective action

of order o(2) to the cft solution, which leaves us with one free parameter. setting this

parameter to two dierent values allows us to exhibit these two dierent types of behavior by

numerically integrating the (+) branch vacuum solution. while we nd that the solutions

are not compelled to ow to the xed points, such behavior seems to occur over a large

portion of the parameter space.

while these observations depend on the exact nature of the cft solution and we should

not expect it to be exact as we are working in conformal perturbation theory, we remark

that much of the previous argument can be applied to a solution which only qualitatively

resembles the cft solution. the fact it is a q = 0 solution is necessary only because it exits

from a  < 0 xed point. as this is the most reliable perturbative regime (as t  ), this

is perhaps reasonable. and while we lose the exact factorization arguments, a line of zeros

of a polynomial expression does not simply terminate at a point as the cft solution does.

so we should expect that the resulting curve of xed points can again be extended.

we have made use of the time reversed cft solution but have made no mention of sfd.

we expect imposing the naive form of sfd will only eliminate good xed point behavior, as

we have argued, so we do not base any arguments on it. we do expect that the form of the

action should reect some form of sfd, but without knowing something of its nature it is
dicult to be exact. since the naive sfd partner of the cft solution ows out of a  < 0
xed point we should expect the exact sfd partner does as well, making it in turn a q = 0

solution and a line of xed points. so we may nd other walls of xed points around as well,

compelling the solution coming out of the (+) vacuum to have good xed point behavior.

4 conclusions

we have seen that the known information about the nature of the o() corrections to

the eective action coming from string theory are insucient to decide whether inationary

branch used in the pre-big-bang scenario exhibits curvature saturation by owing into a xed

27

point. attempts to use sfd to further constrain the action nally lead an exact statement

independent of the order of correction that naive sfd simply works against this behavior.

however we have also observed that naive sfd simply cannot be implemented at o() in

the general anisotropic case and we concur with other work suggesting that sfd itself must

receive higher order corrections.

we have also scanned the parameter space of possible forms of corrections and have de-

termined that good xed point behavior, while not universal, does occupy a large region of

this parameter space. finally, we have attempted to construct a plausible approximation to

a conformally exact solution and discovered that independent of its exact form, a generically

similar solution forces the equations of motion to a corresponding action to exhibit a degen-

eracy which forces the existence of continuous lines of xed points. these xed points can

in turn powerfully constraint the possible evolution of the (+) inationary branch, opening

the possibility that deeper knowledge of some conformally exact solutions may be enough to

settle the question of whether string theory predicts curvature saturation for the inationary

scenario of string cosmology.
