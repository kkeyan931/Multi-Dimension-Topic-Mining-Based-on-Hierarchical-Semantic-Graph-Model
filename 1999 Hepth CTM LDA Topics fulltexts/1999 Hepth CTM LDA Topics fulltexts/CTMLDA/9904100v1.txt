conformally invariant boundary conditions for minimal models on a cylinder are classied by pairs of lie algebras (a, g)
of ade type. for each model, we consider the action of its (discrete) symmetry group on the boundary conditions. we nd
that the invariant ones correspond to the nodes in the tensor product graph a  g that are xed by some automorphism. we
proceed to determine the charges of the elds in the various hilbert spaces, but, as it turns out, many consistent solutions
occur. even if one specic solution looks more natural than the others, which one could conjecture to be the physical solution,
a proper interpretation of the boundary elds is needed to x unambiguously the charge normalization in the presence of mixed
boundary conditions.

i. introduction

it has been an extremely fruitful idea to study a con-
formal eld theory by putting it on various surfaces, with
or without boundaries. apart from the sphere, that has
been considered rst, prime examples of nontrivial ge-
ometries include the torus [1] and the cylinder [2,3]. they
serve to probe dierent facets of a given conformal the-
ory. however the data specic of these surfaces are in-
extricably related to each other, and this fact provides
very stringent constraints on the theory itself, allowing
for example to determine its eld content.

for minimal conformal theories, the problem on the
torus for singlevalued elds has been resolved in [4]:
consistent models have a periodic partition function that
can be associated in a unique way with a pair (a, g) of
simple lie algebras of ade type.

the solution of the analogous problem for the cylinder
is much more recent, even if early calculations in either
specic models or with specic boundary conditions have
been carried out in [2,3,5]. the recent discovery in [6] of
a new conformally invariant boundary condition in the
3state potts model triggered a renewal of interest in
the problem. for minimal models, its solution was given
in [7,8], and shown to be encoded in the same dynkin
graphs that specify the torus partition function.

when a model has a symmetry, necessarily discrete in
this context, elds can be multiplevalued on the torus,
so that nonperiodic sectors exist. furthermore, the
elds transform under the symmetry group, and, when a
diagonalization is possible, can be assigned charges. all
this information is encoded in frustrated partition func-
tions, covariant under the modular group of the torus,

a fact that can be used to, rst, detect the presence of
a symmetry, and then to compute the various partition
functions [9,10].

in this article, we address the question of the action of
the symmetry group on the cylinder partition functions
for the minimal models. we show how the symmetry
group acts on the boundary conditions, and identify the
invariant (or symmetric) ones. we then study the charge
assignments of the elds that occur in the presence of
those boundary conditions.

section ii is a reminder about the minimal conformal
models on a torus and on a cylinder. in section iii, we
discuss the action of the symmetry group on the confor-
mally invariant boundary conditions, which is then used
in section iv to compute frustrated partition functions
on a cylinder. the unicity of these is examined in section
v, in the light of which we suggest in the form of a con-
jecture what the physical partition functions could be.
we nish by giving in section vi, explicit formulae for
the charges of the primary elds in the various boundary
conditions.

ii. minimal models

minimal models are classied by a pair (a, g) of
simplylaced simple lie algebras with coprime coxeter
numbers, p and q. one may assume that p is odd. their
periodic partition function on a torus of modulus  is a
sesquilinear form in the virasoro characters

z(a, g) = xi,j

mij 

i ( ) j ( ),

mij  n,

(2.1)

where i, j are labels for virasoro highest weight repre-
sentations. they lie in the kac table {(r, s) : 1  r 
p  1, 1  s  q  1}, in which (r, s) and (p  r, q  s)
must be identied. the connection with the lie algebras

is best brought out by writing the diagonal elements mii
as [4]

z(a, g) = 1

2 xrexp a

sexp g

|r,s|2 + o-diagonal,

(2.2)

where r and s run over the exponents of a and g. the
full expressions of the partition functions are given in [4].
the question of the symmetry group has been ad-
dressed in [10], in the unitary models |p  q| = 1. the
analysis can however be easily extended to the non
unitary minimal models, with the following result. with
the exception of the models (ap1, aq1) with p and q
odd, which have no symmetry at all, the other mod-
els (a, g) have a nite symmetry group , which is the
group of automorphisms of the dynkin graph of g, that
is, (g) = z2 except (d4) = s3 and (e7, e8) = {1}.
when a model has a symmetry group, the elds may
have a nontrivial monodromy along the two periods
of the torus, transforming as (z + 1) = g(z) and
(z +  ) = g
(z) for two commuting elements g, g  .
in the hamiltonian formalism, this amounts to give a
hilbert space hg of states with a gmonodromy along the
rst period, which are then acted on by g when trans-
ported along the second period. the latter action can be
diagonalized, g
|i = e2iq/n |i, dening the charge q
of the eld  under the action of g, an element of order
n .

the eld content of hg as well as their charges
can be read o from the frustrated partition functions
zg,g (a, g). these are still sesquilinear forms but with
coecients in z(e2i/||):

zg,g = trhg hql0c/24 q

l0c/24 gi.

(2.3)

because a modular transformation mixes the two periods,
it must be accompanied by a corresponding change of
boundary conditions so that the net eect vanishes (for
a xed pair (a, g)):

zg,g ( ) = zgagc,gbgd ( a +b

c +d ).

(2.4)

all such functions are given explicitly in [10] (with a
straightforward extension to the nonunitary case). the
function (2.2) corresponds to g = g = e.

on a cylinder, say of length l and perimeter t , only
one virasoro algebra remains, so that the partition func-
tion is linear rather than sesquilinear in the characters [2].
conformally invariant boundary conditions ,  must be
specied on the two boundaries, and a monodromy con-
dition g must be imposed along the periodic coordinate,
(z + t ) = g(z). we rst consider a trivial monodromy,
g = e.

if the time variable is dened to run along the peri-
odic direction, the partition function is the trace of the
transfer matrix et h, ,

the integer ni
eld with kac label i in the hilbert space h,.

, gives the multiplicity of the primary

alternatively, one may view the time evolution as going
from one boundary to the other. in this case, the states
on constant time surfaces belong to the bulk periodic
hilbert space he, and are propagated in time from one
boundary state |i to the other |i (formally also in he).
the partition function is then

z e

,( ) = h|elhe|i,

(2.6)

with he the hamiltonian corresponding to periodic bulk
sector.

the boundary states are conformally invariant, satis-
fying (ln  ln)|i for all n  z. the solutions to
this equation are the ishibashi states [11]: every high-
est weight representation [i  i] contains exactly one
such state, which we denote by |iii, while the other
representations [i  j], for i 6= j, do not contain any.
in the present situation, the ishibashi states must be
taken from the space he, and hence are labelled by
ee = {i : [i  i]  he}.
states, |i = pi ci

expanding the boundary states in the basis of ishibashi
 |iii, makes the partition function

(2.6) take the form

z,( ) = xiee

ci
 ci

 i( 1

 ).

(2.7)

the arguments of the characters in (2.5) and (2.7) are
related by the modular transformation  7 1
 , under
which the characters transform linearly through a uni-
tary matrix s. comparing the two formulae then yields
cardys equation [3]

ni

, = xjee

si,j cj

.

(2.8)

the relations (2.8) are overdetermined for the vectors
cj, and provide a means to classify the boundary condi-
tions |i, to compute the spectra of h,, and in turn
the surface scaling dimensions. such calculations have
been carried out in [2,5,6], but the general answer ap-
peared only very recently in [7,8]. let 1 be the label
corresponding to the vacuum representation, namely to
(r, s) = (1, 1) = (p  1, q  1).

in [8],

it was observed that, upon setting ci

tion

the matrices ni have eigenvalues si,j/s1,j, and a com-
mon eigenbasis is given by the vectors j. as a result,
they satisfy the fusion rules

reversing the argument, the authors of [8] conclude that
an nvalued representation of the fusion algebra of di-
mension |ee| provides a solution to cardys equation with
|ee| dierent boundary conditions. when ci
is an invertible matrix, this solution yields the maximal
set of conformally invariant boundary conditions. note
that the boundary states |i are determined up to a
phase, but the fact that the entries of ni are to be positive
integers leaves only a global, unobservable, phase.

/ps1,i

 = i

for minimal models, this was all made explicit in [7].
for the model (a, g), it was shown that each node in
the tensor product dynkin diagram a  g, quotiented
by an appropriate z2 automorphism, denes a boundary
condition and viceversa. indeed, from (2.2), the num-
ber of ishibashi states in the periodic sector is |ee| =
1
2 |expa  expg|, so that only half the nodes can dene
distinct boundary conditions. we will use the variables
,  and (ai, bi) as labels for the nodes of a  g. the
letters a and g will denote at the same time the lie
algebras, the dynkin diagrams or the corresponding ad-
jacency matrices.

as a result of the quotient of the tensor product graph,

the matrices ni, for i = (r, s), are given by [7]

(a1,b1),(a2,b2) = ( nr)a1,a2 (vs)b1,b2 + ( nr)a1,a
ni
2 (vs)b1,b
(2.11)

in this formula, the n s and the v s are the fused adja-
cency matrices of a and g respectively. they are dened
recursively by xm = x2xm1  xm2, with x1 = 1 and
x2 = a if x = n , and x2 = g if x = v . equivalently,

nr = ur1(a),

vs = us1(g),

(2.12)

where um(2 cos x) = sin (m + 1)x/ sin x is the mth
tchebychev polynomial of the second kind. the auto-
morphism (a, b) 7 (a, b) can be determined from the
condition n(r,s) = n(pr,qs) (necessary if the ni are to
it yields a and b to be
satisfy the fusion algebra).
given1 by the nontrivial automorphism of a and g, for
g 6= deven, e7, e8, and b = b for g = deven, e7, e8.

seeing the tensor product f i(a, g) = nr  vs as the
fused adjacency matrices of a  g, the above result may
be summarized by saying that ni is a folded fused adja-
cency matrix of a  g

, = f i
ni

, (a, g) + f i

, (a, g).

(2.13)

the eigendata for the matrices a and g make sure that
the matrices in (2.11) satisfy the minimal model fusion
algebra. for the (a, a) models, the ai (resp. bi) labels
run over the same set as r (resp. s), and the matrices ni
are the fusion matrices n i themselves [3].

1the automorphism  in g thus coincides with the charge
conjugation in the corresponding ane algebra g.

iii. symmetric boundary conditions

we now proceed to the analysis of the cylinder par-
tition functions when there is a group of symmetry .
from now on, we thus take q even, and g 6= e7, e8.

the boundary states are combinations of periodic
ishibashi states, on which the action of  is known from
the torus partition functions ze,g. this induces an action
on the boundary states which one can determine. that
action must be by permutations.

for the minimal models, a boundary state corresponds

to a pair of nodes on a and g,

i(a, b) |iii.

(3.1)

|(a, b)i = xiee

1

ps1,i

where the i form an eigenbasis for the concrete matrices
in (2.11).

let us denote by  the automorphisms of g, so that
every  has xed points. (the automorphism of the a
factor has a free action, and is used to obtain a set of
representatives under the  involution, see (2.11).) each
 has a diagonalizable action on the eigenvectors i.

the action of g   on a periodic ishibashi state can
be read o from the diagonal terms in the frustrated par-
tition function ze,g(a, g) [10]. these can be compactly
presented as follows. if g has order n , and if one writes
the diagonal terms in ze,g as

ze,g = xiee

qg (i)
n

|i|2 + . . . ,

(3.2)

then, for a proper choice of the i, the phase is seen to
be exactly equal to the eigenvalue of i under an order
n automorphism :

i(a, (b)) = qg (i)

n

i(a, b).

(3.3)

the  that is induced by g through the previous formula
is unambiguous in the models (a, g) if g is not d4: the
only nontrivial g induces the only nontrivial . when
the d4 algebra is involved, exactly which  in s3 arises
from a set of charges qg (univoquely given by ze,g) de-
pends on the eigenbasis we choose. in particular, a same
set of z2 charges can lead to the three dierent (but con-
jugate) order two s.

it quickly follows from (3.1) and (3.3) that an order
n element g acts on the boundary states as an order n
automorphism :

|(a, b)i  |g(a, b)i = |(a, (b))i.

(3.4)

therefore, for any subgroup  of , the symmetric
boundary conditions correspond to the nodes of a  g
that are xed by a group  of automorphisms of g. this
set of nodes form a graph which we call the xed point
graph and denote by a  g.

in particular, the boundary conditions that are invari-
ant under a group element g correspond to the nodes in

a  g, with g the part of g that is xed by the auto-
morphism  induced by g. as before the pairs of nodes
which are related by the  automorphism dene the same
invariant boundary conditions. in the minimal models,
the xed point diagrams that arise for the various choices
of g are

(ap1, aq1) :
(ap1, dq/2+1) :
(ap1, d4) :
(ap1, e6) :

t(p1)/2  a1,
t(p1)/2  aq/21,
t(p1)/2  a1,
t(p1)/2  a2,

(g2 = e),

(g3 = e),

(3.5)

where t(p1)/2 denotes the tadpole diagram obtained by
quotienting ap1 by its automorphism .

for instance, the xed point graph of an element g
of order two in the (ap1, dq/2+1) model is graphically
given by

iv. cylinder partition functions

the consequences of a symmetry can now be pursued
at the level of the partition functions. let us suppose that
 and  are two boundary conditions that are invariant
under a group element g, of order n .

it implies that the transfer matrix eh, and g com-
mute, and can be diagonalized in the same basis. the
eect, on the cylinder partition function, of the insertion
of g on a line connecting the two boundaries is to aect
each virasoro tower with a n th root of unity, so that
the rst form (2.5) becomes

z g
,( ) = xi

n(g) i
, i( ).

(4.1)

this shows that n(g) i must be related in the following
way to the restriction of ni to the gsymmetric boundary
conditions: an entry of ni equal to n becomes in n(g) i a
sum of n n th roots of unity.

in the second form, the boundary state |i is propa-
gated to |i by the hamiltonian that acts on the bulk
sector twisted by g, so that

z g
,( ) = h|elhg |i.

(4.2)

this formula makes it clear that the states |i and |i
should have a projection in the twisted hilbert space hg,
and being conformally invariant, must have expansions in
ishibashi states of the bulk gsector, themselves labelled
|iiig,
by eg = {i :
one obtains a cardy equation

[i  i]  hg}. setting |i = pi c(g) i
n(g) i

c(g) j

(4.3)

for all boundary conditions which are gsymmetric.

by inspecting the torus partition functions zg,e(a, g)
[10] (see also the last section), one readily sees that the
matrices c(g) i

are square, namely



|eg| = 1

2 |a  g| = |t  g|,
where the factor 1
2 accounts for the identication under .
let us also note that, since the gishibashi states form a
basis for boundary states that are invariant under g, they
should themselves be all neutral for consistency. this is
again easily checked from zg,g.

(4.4)

the rest of this article is devoted to a discussion of the
solutions to the cardy equation (4.3). we will suggest
that the proper physical solution is the natural general-
ization to g 6= e of the two formulae (2.9) and (2.13) for
ni.

our rst statement is that a solution n(g) i, compatible
with ni  n(e) i, is provided, modulo a sign i, by the
folded fused adjacency matrices of the graph a  g:

n(g) i
, = i(cid:2)f i

,(a, g) + f i

, (a, g)(cid:3),

i = 1.

(4.5)

here  = (a1, b1) and  = (a2, b2) are pairs of nodes in
a  g (with the usual identication under ), and the
automorphism  is the same as before.

when g,  6= e, this formula can be simplied because
every b2 in g is a xed point of . indeed since  is a
node of ag, b2 is a xed point of . but  and  coin-
cide, except for g = deven for which  is trivial anyway.
thus the folding by  acts on a2 only, resulting in an
eective folding of the a factor (hence the graphs (3.5)).
one may check that the folded fused adjacency matri-
ces of ap1 are the fused adjacency matrices of t(p1)/2.
thus the matrices in (4.5) are simply proportional to the
fused adjacency matrices of the xed point diagram

n(g) i
, = i f i

,(t, g) = i ur1(t )a1,a2 us1(g)b1,b2.

(4.6)

the matrices f i(t, g) fall short of satisfying the min-
imal fusion algebra, but the factors i can be adjusted so
that the n(g) i do satisfy it.

the fusion algebra of the minimal model m(p, q) is
polynomially generated by two generators x and y ,
which one can associate with the representatives of n (2,1)
and n (1,2) [12]. the elements of the algebra are explicitly
given by tchebychev polynomials

n i = ur1(x) us1(y ),

(4.7)

and the generators must satisfy three relations:

up1(x) = uq1(y ) = up2(x)  uq2(y ) = 0. (4.8)

the matrices f i(t, g) have the proper form (4.7),
and t(p1)/2 and g do indeed satisfy the rst two rela-
tions in (4.8). this is most easily seen by verifying that

all eigenvalues satisfy the relevant equation. for instance,
the eigenvalues m of t(p1)/2 are in

spec(t p1

2

) = {2 cos m
p

: 1  m odd  p  1},

(4.9)

and clearly satisfy up1(m) = 0.

in the same way, one computes that

up2(t p1

2

) = 1.

(4.10)

the corresponding calculation for g yields2, in the same
four cases as in (3.5),

g = a q

g = a1 :
2 1 :
g = a1 :
g = a2 :

uq2(g) = (1)
uq2(g) = 1,
uq2(g) = 1,
u10(g) = 1,

q

2 +1 1,

(4.11)

where the last line refers to the models (ap1, e6) for
which q = 12. thus, except when g = a1 and when
q = 2 mod 4, the last condition in (4.8) is not fullled.

q

owing to the parity properties of the tchebychev poly-
nomials, um(x) = (1)mum(x), one easily sees that
2 +1 t(p1)/2 in the rst and third cases of
x = (1)
(4.11), and x = t(p1)/2 in the second and fourth ones,
together with y = g, do satisfy all three conditions and
therefore generate the correct algebra.

correspondingly, one nds that the matrices n(g) i =

f i(x, y ) = if i(t, g) with the following signs,

(ap1, aq1) :
2 +1) :
(ap1, d q
(ap1, d4) :
(ap1, e6) :

i = (1)(r+1)( q
i = (1)r+1,
i = 1,
i = (1)r+1.

(g3 = e),

2 +1),

(g2 = e),

(4.12)

obey the minimal fusion algebra. because of the signs i
but also because the matrices f i(t, g) are not positive
for  6= e (they are however of constant sign), the n(g) i
provide zrepresentations3 of the minimal fusion algebra.
it remains to prove our earlier assertion that the so

dened n(g) i are solutions to cardys equation (4.3).

since they satisfy the fusion algebra, the n(g) i must
have eigenvalues given by ratios si,j
of s matrix ele-
s1,j
ments. it is not dicult to see, by looking rst at the
partition functions zg,e to get eg and then by computing

2the adjacency matrix of a1 is the number zero, so that
its fused adjacency matrices are us1(0) = (1)(s1)/2 for s
odd, and 0 for s even.
3in case of a z3 symmetry group, one might expect
z(e2i/3)valued representations. this is however excluded
by the symmetry zg
, (time reversal invariance),
which implies the reality of n(g) i
, .

, = zg

the ratios explicitly (see last section), that the eigenval-
ues of n(g) i are precisely the above ratios for j  eg.
thus the following diagonalization formulae hold

n(g) i
, = xjeg

(g) j



si,j

(4.13)

where the vectors (g) j form a common orthonormal
eigenbasis (also common to all fused adjacency matri-
ces f i(t, g) of the xed point diagram). this yields
the value of the coecients in (4.3)

c(g) j
 =

(g) j



.

(4.14)

to complete the proof, it is enough to show that they
are compatible with the ni, in the sense that has been
explained in section iii: an entry in ni equal to n goes
over, in n(g) i, to a sum of n roots of unity, and moreover
n(g) 1 = 1. one may verify that this is indeed the case.
we omit the proof here since, to a large extent, it is given
in the last section.

the formulae (4.5) and (4.13) bear much resemblance
with the corresponding ones for ni, of which they consti-
tute a natural extension. like the ni, the matrices n(g) i
have a graph theoretic description derived from that of
ni through the action of g, they satisfy the minimal fu-
sion algebra, and their eigenvalues are exactly labelled
by the set eg which species the diagonal terms of the
twisted partition functions zg,e. we will see in the last
section that this set eg can also be viewed as the set of
exponents of the graph that serves to dene n(g) i.

v. unicity

the boundary conditions that are invariant under a
group element g correspond to boundary states which
have expansions in gishibashi states

|i = xieg

c(g) i


|iiig.

(5.1)

the coecients in (4.14) provide a specic solution to
cardys equation (4.3). as for the ni, one may raise the
question of the unicity of this solution.

for every g, the symmetric boundary conditions ex-
haust the gishibashi states. it means that every other
symmetric boundary state must be a linear combination
of those we already have, and so must be one of them.
however, since the boundary states |i enter cardys for-
mula through scalar products, it is the boundary rays
more than the boundary states which matter. thus the
basic question is whether one keeps a sensible solution if
one multiplies the boundary states by phases.

clearly if the symmetric boundary states are multi-
plied by phases, |i  |i, the matrices change ac-
cording to n(g) i
, , which satisfy the minimal
fusion algebra for any choice of phases.

,  

n(g) i

whereas for g = e, the positivity of n(e) i = ni forces
all the phases to be equal, this is no longer the case when
g 6= e. since the matrices n(g) i are zvalued, the only
condition one has is that the phases must be equal up to
signs,  =  .

for a z2 symmetry, the new matrices n(g) i

, are
also solutions of the cardy equation, because they too
are compatible with the ni.
indeed the compatibility
amounts to check that ni and n(g) i coincide modulo 2,
which obviously remains true if signs are inserted. more-
over, the identity primary eld occurs in the diagonal
boundary conditions only,  = , for which the signs
cancel out. thus the charge of the identity is not af-
fected.

on the contrary, in the case of a z3 symmetry, the
insertion of signs  does not yield sensible solutions (as
far as the minimal models are concerned): given that
n(g) i, uniquely dened as above, is compatible with ni,
one quickly nds that none of those with nontrivial 
can be. the reason is that some of the elds occur with
multiplicity two. since the corresponding entries in n(g) i
must be real combinations of two third roots of unity,
they can only be 2 or 1. therefore, changing their sign
by inserting some  is not consistent.

thus when the symmetry group is z2, there is a vast
number of seemingly acceptable solutions. these various
solutions dier by the charges which are assigned to the
primary elds in mixed boundary conditions ( 6= ).
the freedom we have in choosing the  reects the fact
that the charge normalization in mixed boundary condi-
tions cannot be xed a priori, unlike what happens for
diagonal boundary conditions, in which an identity oc-
curs.

one may try to derive more constraints on the charge
normalizations by requiring that the boundary charge as-
signments be compatible with (i) the charge assignments
in the bulk, and (ii) the boundary eld operator product
coecients.

the rst requirement is a condition on the way bulk
elds close to a boundary (taken to be y = 0) expand in
boundary elds [13,14]

j (x + iy)  xb.c. xk

j yhk2hj 

k (x),

(5.2)

where the summation on  is over all boundary condi-
tions, not just the invariant ones. the z2 symmetry im-
plies selection rules on the coecients since a bulk eld of
a given parity should expand in a combination of bound-
ary elds that transforms the same way. it means that
the parity of the eld 
k must match that of j for all
invariant boundary conditions such that ()bk

j 6= 0.

since these expansions involve elds in diagonal
boundary conditions only, the selection rules that fol-
low are the same no matter what the signs  are. this
does not prove however that the selection rules are indeed
satised. for the diagonal models (a, a), the coecients

()bk
j are known explicitly [15], and it would be interest-
ing to check directly that their values are consistent with
the boundary charge assignment we have found in this
article.

the second consistency condition concerns the opera-

tor algebra of the boundary elds themselves [13,14]

restricting to invariant boundary conditions , , , the
discrete symmetry implies again selection rules which re-
quire that the charges given by the matrices n(g) i should
provide a grading of the boundary fusion algebra4:

c() k

6= 0 = n(g) i

, n(g) j

, .

(5.4)

it is obvious that if the matrix coecients n(g) i
, satisfy
(5.4), the same will be true of n(g) i
, , so that here
too, these matrices are all consistent with the boundary
operator product expansion (5.3), or else none of them is.
as the discrete symmetry is expected to occur, one can
be condent in the fact that the selection rules will be
satised. it is nonetheless not trivial to verify that this
is indeed the case. one can illustrate this in the most
explicit case, namely the diagonal models.

in the diagonal models (a, a), the boundary conditions
are in onetoone correspondence with the chiral primary
elds through their labelling by two nodes (a, b) taken
in ap1 and aq1. as before, the boundary conditions
(a, b) = (p  a, q  b) and (a, b) are to be identied.
without loss of generality, one may thus assume that the
rst label (the rlabel) is odd.

the boundary operator product coecients are known
explicitly from [15], where they were proved to be equal
to coecients of the crossing matrices (in a suitable nor-
malization)

(5.5)

since for instance, an odd boundary eld 

cannot
occur in its fusion with itself, the corresponding crossing
coecient must vanish. the verication that it does is
nontrivial only when the chiral eld i indeed occurs in
its own bulk fusion (namely n i
ii 6= 0), when the primary
eld i indeed occurs in the diagonal boundary conditions

i

4we leave aside the cases where some matrix elements n(g) i
,
are zero without having the corresponding elements in ni
equal to zero. this happens when several elds with the same
conformal properties come in pairs of opposite charge. the
 ambiguity does not aect them since the relevant matrix
elements are zero anyway.

for all i = (r, s) such that r, s are odd, s = 3 mod 4,
r  (2p  1)/3, s  (2q  1)/3, and for all  = (a, q/2)
such that (r + 1)/2  a  p/2.

the simplest example where such constraints arise is
the tricritical ising model (a4, a3), in which (5.6) implies

more conditions can be derived in a generic diagonal
model.

to summarize, the ambiguity in the charge normaliza-
tion that arises in mixed boundary conditions, due to the
factors , must be resolved on physical grounds. as the
interpretation of all the boundary elds is lacking in the
general case, it is not clear to the author what the cor-
rect physical requirement should be. in this context, the
specic choice (4.6) with the sign i given in (4.12), is a
minimal and natural one, as it extends nicely the corre-
sponding formula for g = e and retains much of the graph
theoretic description. it also has the distinctive feature
of producing matrices n(g) i of constant sign, either to-
tally positive or totally negative (implying that when a
given virasoro primary occurs, whatever the boundary
conditions, it does so with the same charge).

this choice is not the only one to have the constant
sign property. because q is even, it is clear that in the
formula (4.6) giving n(g) i, one can substitute g for
g without changing much of the main properties. in-
deed the new matrices are still zvalued, and satisfy the
minimal fusion algebra. moreover the diagonal elements
us1(g)b,b = us1(g)b,b because they are all zero
for s even, and thus the charge normalization does not
change for mixed boundary conditions.

the substitution of g into g has no eect when
g = a1, since the associated adjacency matrix is the
number zero.
in the other cases, namely the models
(a, d) and (a, e6) for an order two g, the eect is to
multiply i by (1)s+1. this factor can be seen to be
in the line of the previous discussion, because it is equal
to a product a : (1)s+1 =  where  = (1)b+1
if  = (a, b).
it is presumably the only choice of s,
such that the matrices n(g) i have constant sign. it
can also be seen to be related to the existence of a non
trivial automorphism of the graph g.

to nish this section, we would conjecture that, among
all sensible solutions to cardys equation, the specic one
displayed in (4.6) and (4.12) is the physical one. we have
no strong argument supporting this conjecture but the
fact that it appears to be the minimal solution.

vi. charges

in this last section we give some computational details
that were missing in section iv, and we determine the
charges of the primary elds as given by (4.6) and (4.12).
in other words, we make the assumption that that spe-
cic solution to cardys equation is the physical one, as
was suggested in the previous section.

before doing that, we recall that the formula giving
the s matrix elements in the minimal model m(p, q) is,
for i = (r, s) and j = (r, s),

si,j = r 8

pq

(1)rs+rs+1 sin

qrr

p

sin

pss

q

.

(6.1)

we start with the diagonal series (ap1, aq1), p odd
and q even, of which the symmetry group is z2. the
invariant boundary conditions  = (a, b) are controlled
by the tadpole graph t(p1)/2  a1, i.e. a runs from 1 to
(p  1)/2 and b = q/2.

from (4.6) and (4.12), the matrices n(g) i are

n(g) i = (1)(r+1)( q

2 +1) ur1(t p1

2

) us1(0).

(6.2)

since the frustrated partition function are [10],

zg,e(a, a) = 1

2 xr,s



r,s r,qs = x1r oddp1

1sq1



r,s r,qs,

(6.3)

it follows that the twisted ishibashi states |jiig can be
labelled by

eg(a, a) = {j = (m, q

2 ) : 1  m odd  p  1}.

(6.4)

(which representative (r, s) or (p  r, q  s) we take does
not matter, since the s matrix elements are the same.)

for these values of j, an easy calculation yields

si,j
s1,j

= (1)(r+1)( q

2 +1) ur1(2 cos qm

p ) us1(0). (6.5)

since q is even, the numbers which appear as arguments
of ur1 coincide with the set (4.9) of eigenvalues of the in-
cidence matrix t(p1)/2. a simple comparison with (6.2)
shows that the eigenvalues of n(g) i are indeed the num-
bers in (6.5) for j  eg, and that the set eg itself is in
exact correspondence with the exponents of the tensor
graph t(p1)/2  a1.

as mentioned before, the matrices ni are the fusion

matrices n i themselves [3], equal, from (2.11), to

ni

(a1, q

2 ),(a2, q

2 ) = n i

(a1, q

2 ),(a2, q

2 ) = ur1(t p1

2

)a1,a2 , (6.6)

for all odd s, and identically equal to zero for s even.

inserting this in (6.2) leads to

n(g) i
(a1, q

2 ),(a2, q

2 ) = (1)(r+1)( q

2 +1)+ s1

2 n i

(a1, q

2 ),(a2, q

2 ). (6.7)

the sign in front of the fusion coecient gives the charge
of the primary eld (r, s), its occurrence being deter-
mined by the fusion coecient itself. this equation also
shows clearly that n(g) i is compatible with ni in the sense
explained before.

we can also consider the z2 symmetry in the models
(ap1, dq/2+1), for two coprime integers p, q and p odd
as before. the nontrivial group element g induces the
automorphism  of dq/2+1 which exchanges the last two
nodes. therefore the symmetric boundary states cor-
respond to the nodes (a, b) of the xed point diagram
t(p1)/2  aq/21, pictured in section iii, so that a is
between 1 and (p  1)/2, and b is between 1 and q/2  1.

the frustrated (antiperiodic) partition function on the
torus is (the double sums run over [1, p  1]  [1, q  1])

thus the kac labels of the gishibashi states |jiig can
be chosen in the set

eg(a, d) = {j = (m, m) : 1  m odd  p  1,

1  m even  q  1},

(6.12)

namely, the set of exponents of the product graph
t(p1)/2  aq/21.

from this, one computes

which coincide, in view of (6.9) and (6.10), with the eigen-
values of n(g) i. the numbers in the set {2 cos pm
q } come
by pairs of opposite sign, so that the set of ratios (6.13),
for xed i, is the same whether or not there is a minus
sign in the argument of us1. each individual ratio how-
ever diers by a factor (1)s+1, which then leads to the
alternative solution for n(g) i discussed at the end of the
previous section.

finally the compatibility of n(g) i with the original ma-
in the sector of invariant

trices ni can be established.

where b1, b2 are restricted to lie in [1, q/2  1]. one may
simply notice the following modular identity (same values
of the indices)

us1(d q

2 +1) = us1(a q

2 1) mod 2.

it has the immediate consequence that

n(g) i
, = ni

, mod 2.

(6.15)

(6.16)

which shows the required compatibility.

on the basis of the above formula for n(g) i, one
can now easily determine the charges of the various
elds. one rst notes that all the entries of n(g) i are in
{0, +1, 1}, whereas those of ni are in {0, 1, 2}. more-
over, the matrices ur1(t(p1)/2) are all positive, unlike
the us1(aq/21), which are positive for s < q/2, neg-
ative for s > q/2, and identically zero for s = q/2, on
account of uqs1(aq/21) = us1(aq/21).

putting these observations together, one can conclude
that the paired elds, corresponding to the labels i =
(r, q/2), have opposite z2 charges within each pair, and
that the charge of an unpaired eld with label i = (r, s)
is equal to (1)r+1 if s < q/2, and equal to (1)r if
s > q/2.

a nontrivial check can be made in the particular case
of the critical 3potts model, corresponding to p = 5
and q = 6. a set of z2symmetric boundary conditions
is provided5 by the socalled a, bc, free and new [6].
they correspond respectively to the nodes (1,1), (2,1),
(1,2) and (2,2).
(free and new, being fully invariant
under s3, must correspond to b = 2, which is the only
node of d4 invariant under s3.)

a straight calculation shows that the hilbert space

with mixed boundary condition a,free is

ha,free = [(4, 4)]1/8 + [(4, 2)]13/8,

(6.17)

where the subscripts are the conformal weights. it results
from the above charge assignment calculations that the
rst eld is even under the z2 group, while the second is
odd, as was indeed computed long ago by cardy [2].

when q = 6, i.e. for (ap1, d4) models, z3 invariant
boundary conditions can be investigated. they are la-
belled by nodes (a, 2) with a in t(p1)/2. from (4.6) and
(4.12), one has n(g) i = f i(t p1
, a1), or more explicitly

ditions, corresponding to the other two (conjugate) z2 sub-
groups of s3.

so that the ishibashi states in the z3twisted sector have
labels j = (m, 3) for m odd between 1 and p  1.

the z3 charges of the primary elds follow by compar-
ing the above matrices n(g) i in (6.18) with the restriction
of ni to the sector of invariant boundary conditions, given
by ur1(t(p1)/2)a1,a2us1(d4)2,2.

(6.20)

as in the z2 case, the second line shows that the doubled
elds have opposite and nonzero z3 charge (if  6= 1 is
a third root of unity,  + 2 = 1).

the models (ap1, e6) are somewhat similar to the
(a, d) models. a unique feature of the models based
on e6 however is that some of the elds occur tripled in
specic boundary conditions (in addition to some others
being doubled). one nds that these are the elds (r, s)
with s = 5 and 7, in the boundary conditions correspond-
ing to the nodes (a, 3), for a in t(p1)/2 (with b = 3 the
intersection of the three branches of e6). this follows
from the fused adjacency matrices u4(e6) and u6(e6) of
e6, which, when restricted to the nodes b = 3, 6 corre-
sponding to the symmetric boundary conditions, read

u4(e6) = u6(e6) = (cid:18) 3
