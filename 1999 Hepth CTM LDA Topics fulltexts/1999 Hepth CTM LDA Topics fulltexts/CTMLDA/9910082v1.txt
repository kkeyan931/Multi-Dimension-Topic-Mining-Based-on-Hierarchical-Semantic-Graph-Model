abstract

a very brief review is given of some of the developments leading to our current un-

derstanding of black holes in string theory. this is followed by a discussion of two possible

misconceptions in this subject  one involving the stability of small black holes and the

other involving scale radius duality. finally, i describe some recent results concerning

quasinormal modes of black holes in anti de sitter spacetime, and their implications for

strongly coupled conformal eld theories (in various dimensions).

1. review

this talk is divided into three parts. the rst is a brief review of some of the key

developments leading to our current understanding of black holes in string theory. this

part will be very elementary, and not assume much knowledge of string theory. next, i

will try to clear up two misconceptions that i had until recently, and that i have seen

in the literature. finally, i will describe some recent work about black holes in anti de

sitter spacetime, and their implications for the approach to thermal equilibrium in strongly

coupled conformal eld theories.

since supergravity is the low energy limit of string theory, the study of black holes

begins by nding solutions to this theory with horizons. actually, there are several super-

gravity theories that arise in string theory, starting with the ten and eleven dimensional

theories. since we are in higher dimensions, there are extended black holes, or black p-
branes. the simplest solutions are products of rp with the dp dimensional schwarzschild

solution (where d = 10 or 11), but more interesting solutions carry charge associated with

a p + 2 form. the rank is p + 2 since the solution has p spatial dimensions along the

brane. adding one for time and one for the radius in the transverse space, one nds that

a sphere s which surrounds the brane must have dimension d  (p + 2). the charge is

then q  rs

fp+2. this charge can be nonzero even though there are no fundamental
sources in supergravity, since all you need is nontrivial spacetime topology. this is exactly

analogous the existence of charged black holes in einstein-maxwell theory without charged

matter. the rst charged black p-branes that were found almost ten years [1] ago assumed

maximal symmetry, so all elds were a function of only one radial variable. these solutions

depended on two parameters which were the mass m (really mass per unit volume) and

charge. solutions existed only when m and q satised a certain inequality. since then,

the number of black p-brane solutions has grown enormously as people have learned how

to add multiple charges, rotation, traveling waves, etc. [2].

unlike supergravity, string theory does have sources for many of these charges called

d-branes [3]. the charge to mass ratio of these d-branes is exactly the same as the

extremal limit of the black p-branes, so the latter can be interpreted as the gravitational

eld of the d-brane. at weak coupling, this gravitational eld goes to zero and the low

energy excitations of n parallel d-branes are described by an su (n ) gauge theory. the

strongly coupled description of the same excited system should be a nonextreme black

p-brane. by comparing the weak and strong coupling descriptions, one had the possibility

1

of understanding black hole entropy by counting quantum states for the rst time.

as an example, consider n three-branes. to keep all quantities nite, it is convenient

to compactify the directions along the brane into a three torus. then, in the extreme limit,

the area of the horizon goes to zero, which agrees with the fact that at zero excitation

energy, the only state in the gauge theory is the ground state. to compare the entropies,

we want to add energy to the system. equivalently, we can consider nonzero temperature

t . the eective coupling is gn where g is the string coupling constant. when gn  1

the system is a weakly coupled 3 + 1 dimensional gauge theory at temperature t . when

gn  1 one has a near extremal black three-brane at the same temperature. one can

compare the entropies and nd [4]

sbh =

3
4

sgauge

(1.1)

where sbh is the bekenstein hawking entropy of the black three-brane. so the gauge theory
has roughly the right number of degrees of freedom to explain the entropy of near extremal

black three-branes. the fact that they are not exactly the same was not a surprise. at the

time this was rst computed, it appeared that one had two dierent descriptions of the

same system which were valid for dierent ranges of the parameter gn . they appeared to

have no overlapping region of validity.

however, there were other situations where the entropies agreed exactly. these were

obtained by looking at solutions with more than one charge. for example, suppose four
dimensions of space are compactied on a small t 4. we can take q5 ve-branes and wrap

them around the compact dimensions to produce an eective string in six dimensions. one
can then add q1 one-branes to this string. when g2q1q5  1, the low energy excitations
are described by a 1 + 1 dimensional conformal eld theory [5]. when g2q1q5  1 the

system is described by a black string in six dimensions. if one now adds a small amount

of energy and compares the entropies, one nds complete agreement (for large charges) [6]

sbh = scf t

(1.2)

why is this working? for the special case where the momentum along the eective

string is equal to the added energy, i.e., one excites only right moving modes, there is

unbroken supersymmetry. the momentum along the string is like another charge, and the

black string remains extremal. in this case, one can show that the number of supersym-

metric states should not depend on the coupling. but the entropy turns out to agree even

2

when supersymmetry is broken, e.g., when you excite equal amounts of left and right mov-

ing modes [7,8]. even more importantly, the spectrum of hawking radiation also agrees

[9,10].

the situation was claried by maldacena [11] who took a low energy limit which

decoupled the excitations of the branes from the excitations of the strings o the branes.

at strong coupling, this same limit corresponded to considering strings moving very close

to the horizon of the black p-brane. in the cases of interest, the excitation of the branes is

described by a conformal eld theory (cft), and the near horizon geometry of the extremal

black p-brane is a product of anti de sitter (ads) space and a sphere. for example, in the
case of the three brane, this geometry is ads5  s 5 where the radii of curvature are equal.
for the one-brane ve-brane system, the near horizon geometry is ads3  s 3  t 4. since

the conformal eld theory is well dened even at strong coupling, we obtain two dierent

descriptions which are now valid for the same range of parameters. this lead maldacena

to his famous ads/cft correspondence. if one adds energy to the system, the spacetime

is not exactly ads, but still approaches it asymptotically. so the correspondence says

that string theory in spacetimes which asymptotically approach ads times a sphere is

completely described by a conformal eld theory. there is growing evidence in support of

this remarkable conjecture [12].

how does this explain the entropy results? for the case of the three-brane, it is easy

to see from the eld theory side why the entropy might change between weak and strong

coupling. as you increase the coupling constant you add potential energy to each state and

increase its energy, so the number of states for given total energy goes down. similarly,

from the gravity side one can understand the change in entropy as follows. the near

horizon geometry of the near extremal solution is a black hole in ads. as you lower the

string coupling, the spacetime curvature increases in string units. this results in stringy

corrections to the geometry, and hence corrections to the black hole entropy. in light of

these eects, one would expect the weak coupling and strong coupling results to be related

in a complicated way. the fact that they are related by a simple factor of 3/4 is rather

mysterious and still not understood.

in contrast, for the one-brane ve-brane system, one has a 1 + 1 dimensional cft

whose entropy depends only on the central charge. this can be computed exactly, and

is independent of the coupling constant. on the gravity side, the near horizon geometry
turns out to be the product of a three dimensional btz black hole [13] and s 3  t 4. this

3

is locally a space of constant curvature and probably does not receive string corrections as

g  0 [14]. there are other systems where the entropy can be computed exactly without

supersymmetry, including near extremal four dimensional black holes. but as far as i

know, in all such cases the corresponding eld theory is a 1 + 1 dimensional cft and

the near horizon geometry is a space of constant curvature.

(when there is unbroken

supersymmetry, the entropy can be reproduced for a wider class of black holes, including

higher order corrections to the bekenstein hawking entropy [15].)

in light of the ads/cft correspondence, we can begin to translate questions about

black hole physics into questions about eld theory. for example, the formation of a large

black hole in ads is not an exotic process in the cft. it corresponds to the eld theory

evolution of a very special high energy state into a typical (approximately thermal) state.

more importantly, the formation and evaporation of a small black hole in ads should be

described by the usual unitary evolution in the eld theory.

2. misconceptions

we now come to our rst possible misconception, which involves small black holes in

ads. let r+ denote the horizon radius, and r denote the radius of ads. the temperature of

a black hole in ads decreases with mass for r+  r, but increases with mass for r+  r.

so large black holes have positive specic heat and are stable. small black holes have

negative specic heat and one often concludes that they are unstable and will evaporate.

however, let us compare the entropy of a small black hole with the entropy of the same
amount of energy in a thermal gas. we will consider the case of black holes in ads5  s 5.
since the magnitude of the curvature on s 5 is the same as ads5, a gas of radiation will

be eectively ten dimensional. since the curvature of ads acts like a conning box of side
r, the gas has s  t 9r9 and e  t 10r9, so

sgas  (re)9/10

(2.1)

a small black hole in ads5 which is uniform over the s 5 is unstable to localizing on the s 5

due to the gregory-laamme instability [16]. so we should use ten dimensional black holes
which have sbh  r8
+/8
p,
p, so n is a measure of how large the s 5
which implies sbh  er+. now let r8  n 28
(or ads5) is in planck units. (in the ads/cft correspondence, this is the same n that

p (where p is the ten dimensional planck scale) and e  r7

+/8

appears in the group su (n ), but since we are asking a pure supergravity question, we

4

dont need to introduce any string theory or gauge theory quantities.) so the entropies

will be equal when

this implies

(2.3)

which can be made arbitrarily small for large n . in other words, if r+/r > n 2/17, the

black hole has more entropy than a gas in ads. so its evaporation would violate the second

law of thermodynamics. what happens?

if you x the temperature, a small black hole with high temperature will simply absorb

energy from the heat bath until it turns into a large black hole with the same temperature

which is stable. but this is rather unphysical since its hard to connect a heat bath to

ads, and this is not the right boundary conditions when a black hole evaporates. one

should instead x the total energy, and consider a system consisting of both a black hole

and radiation. it is clear that if you start with all the energy in the black hole and radiate
a small amount , sbh   and sg  9/10. so sg + sbh > 0 and you increase the
total entropy by starting to radiate. this is a consequence of the negative specic heat.

but to see the nal outcome, we must maximize the total entropy for given energy. let

us divide the total energy into a part which is the gas, and a part which is the black hole:

e = eg + ebh. as a crude approximation, we will assume the entropy of the gas is the
same that it would be in the absence of the black hole. this may be justied since we are

considering small black holes. the total entropy is then

s  (egr)9/10 + ebh(ebh8

p)1/7

(2.4)

using 8

p  r8/n 2, the second term becomes (e 8

bhr8/n 2)1/7. extreming s keeping the

total energy xed yields

e 7

g e 10

bh 

n 20
r17

(2.5)

since the left hand side has a maximum when eg  ebh, we clearly need er > n 20/17
in order to have a stable equilibrium. (one can easily check that this is equivalent to
our earlier condition r+/r > n 2/17.) when this condition is satised, there are two

extrema of the entropy, a local maximum when ebh > eg and a local minimum when
ebh < eg. when er  n 20/17, the ratio eg/ebh is very small in the maximum entropy
conguration. so the net result is that if you x the total energy, most black holes will

5

evaporate slightly and quickly come into equilibrium with their hawking radiation1. this

is very similar to earlier studies of a black hole in a box.

a simple check on our result is the following. in order for the black hole to be in stable

equilibrium with the radiation, it has to be large enough that it does not evaporate before

the radiation has a chance to see the background curvature. in other words, the lifetime

of the black hole must be larger than r. it is easy to check that in the stable regime,

all black holes satisfy this condition. ignoring the background curvature, the lifetime of a

small ten dimensional black hole can be computed from

de

+/r8. this will be of order r when
since e  r7
r+/r  n 2/9. since n 2/9  n 2/17 for large n , this is much smaller than our lower

p, the lifetime is t0  r9

bound for a black hole to be in stable equilibrium. in the context of string theory, another

thing we should check is whether the size of the black hole remains bigger than the string
scale s. since the smallest stable black hole has r+/r  n 2/17, and r4  gn 4
that r+ will be larger than s provided gn > n 8/17.

s, we see

a similar calculation in eleven dimensions shows that black holes have more entropy
than a gas of radiation provided r+/r > (p/r)9/19 where p is now the eleven dimensional
planck scale.

a second possible misconception concerns the relation between ads radius and scale

size in the cft. in poincare coordinates, the ads metric is simply

ds2 =

r2
r2 (dt2 + dxidxi) +

r2
r2 dr2

(2.7)

since this metric is invariant under r  r, (t, xi)  1(t, xi), it is often assumed that

radial position in ads is reected in the scale size of the corresponding excitation in the

eld theory. this has been checked and is certainly true in many cases, usually involving

static congurations. a particularly simple example of this seemed to be a null particle

moving radially in ads. it produces a gravitational shock wave which is reected in the

eld theory by a < t > which is concentrated on the null cone [18]. so the expanding
excitation in the cft is correlated with decreasing radial position. however, we should

ask what happens if the particle changes its orbit inside ads. the answer turns out to be

1 this is a more rened version of the discussion in [17].

6

that < t > continues to grow at the speed of light even if the particle stops at some
radius r!

this is essentially a consequence of causality: < t > is determined by the asymptotic
form of the spacetime metric, and this metric is causally related to the null particle. letting
z = r2/r, (2.7) becomes

ds2 =

r2
z2 (dt2 + dxidxi + dz2)

(2.8)

a particle initially falling in from t = xi = z = 0 can only inuence elds inside its future
light cone t2  xixi + z2. a point on the boundary z = 0, t = t0, xi = x0
i can only be
i )2 + z2. looking at the
aected by events inside its past light cone (t0  t)2  (xi  x0
intersection of these two sets, its clear that the maximum z value for the particle that can
aect the asymptotic eld at t0, x0

i is

zmax =

1
2

[(t0)2  (x0

i )2]1/2

(2.9)

which occurs at t = t0/2 and xi = x0
i )2  (t0)2, i.e., one approaches
the light cone on the boundary, zmax  0. this means that even if the particle, or better
yet, a rocket ship, stops at a constant value of z inside ads, the eld will continue to

i /2. therefore, as (x0

grow along the light cone on the boundary. of course changing the trajectory inside will

produce additional gravitational waves which will result in a change in the expectation

value of the stress tensor inside the light cone. but the main lesson is that, in dynamical

processes, the size of the disturbance on the boundary is not always a measure of the

radial position of the particle in the interior. (for further examples of this phenomenon,

see [19].)

3. quasinormal modes

a spherical black hole in adsd is described by

where

ds2 = f (r) dt2 + f (r)1dr2 + r2 d2

.

(3.1)

(3.2)

the black hole horizon r = r+ is at the largest zero of f . a particle falling into this black

hole will produce gravitational waves. a rough estimate for when this radiation reaches

7

innity is just the time it takes for the particle to fall from innity to the vicinity of the
black hole. for a large black hole r+  r, this is of order 1/t where t  r+/r2 is the

black hole temperature. at late times, this radiation is independent of the details of what

fell in. it is described by characteristic oscillations of the black hole geometry known as

quasinormal modes [20]. these oscillations are damped and the corresponding quasinormal

frequencies are complex. the mode with the smallest imaginary part dominates at late

time and gives the timescale for generic perturbations to decay. my student v. hubeny and

i have recently computed these quasinormal frequencies. (for a more complete discussion,

see [21].)

the damping time of these oscillations have important implications for the dual cft.

suppose we start with a large static black hole with temperature t . this is described
in the eld theory by the thermal state2 with temperature t . perturbing the black hole,

corresponds to perturbing this thermal state, and the timescale for the decay of the per-

turbation is the timescale for the return to thermal equilibrium. this dynamical timescale

is extremely dicult to compute directly, but can be done relatively easily using the

ads/cft correspondence. for simplicity, we considered perturbations described by a real

scalar eld like the dilaton.

since a black hole in ads has two dimensionful parameters r and r+, it is not obvious

how the quasinormal frequencies  will scale as we change the size of the black hole. but

for large black holes r+  r, it turns out that there is an extra symmetry which ensures

that  will be proportional to the black hole temperature.

let us decompose the quasinormal frequencies into real and imaginary parts as  =

r  ii . (the sign is chosen so that exponentially decaying modes correspond to i > 0.)
the linear dependence with temperature is clearly shown in g. 1 and g. 2, where i and
r respectively are plotted as a function of the temperature for the four, ve, and seven
dimensional cases. we have set the ads radius equal to one, so all quantities are measured

in units of the ads radius. the dots, representing the lowest quasinormal mode for each

black hole, lie on straight lines through the origin. in g. 1, the top line corresponds to

the d = 4 case, the middle line is the d = 5 case, and the bottom line is the d = 7 case.

explicitly, the lines are given by

i = 11.16 t

for d = 4

2 for a black hole formed from collapse of a pure state, the cft state will still be pure, but

resemble the thermal state for macroscopic observations.

(3.3)

for smaller black holes, the quasinormal frequencies do not scale with the temperature.

this is clearly shown in g. 3 which plots i as a function of r+ for d = 4 black holes
with r+  1. to a remarkable accuracy, the points continue to lie along a straight line

i = 2.66 r+. the dashed curve represents the continuation of the curve i = 11.16 t
shown in fig. 1 to smaller values of r+. (for large r+ these two curves are identical.) it is

i = 2.66 r+, and the dashed line is i = 11.16 t .

not yet clear what the signicance of this linear relation is for the dual cft. as we have

seen, these black holes are stable if one xes the total energy, and thus correspond to a

class of stable states in the eld theory. this linear relation is describing the timescale for

the decay of perturbations of these states.

the fact that the quasinormal frequencies do not follow the temperature is very dif-

ferent from small black holes in asymptotically at spacetimes. in that case, there is only

one scale r+ in the problem and the frequencies must go like t  1/r+. it is dierent in

ads simply because the boundary conditions at innity have been changed. it should not

be surprising that even for small black holes, the late time behavior of elds is dierent in

ads than in an asymptotically at spacetime.

there is a striking similarity between the slope of the line in fig. 3 and a number

that has been computed in a completely dierent problem.

if you study the gravita-

tional collapse of spherically symmetric scalar elds (in four dimensional asymptotically

at spacetimes), one nds that weak waves scatter and go o to innity while strong waves

collapse to form black holes. on the boundary between these two possibilities, there is ini-

tial data which collapses to form a zero mass black hole, which is really a naked singularity

[22]. all such initial data approach the same solution, called the critical solution, near the

singularity. this critical solution is known to have one unstable modes which grows like
e2.67t [23]. this number is very similar to the slope 2.66 that we found above. despite the

fact that both numbers characterize exponential behavior of spherically symmetric scalar

elds in four dimensions, further investigation has failed to nd any conrming indications

of a connection between black holes in ads and black hole critical phenomena. it appears

at the moment to be just a numerical coincidence.

one reason for this is that the linear relation does not extend to very small black

holes. in fact, since the quasinormal frequencies can be computed to an accuracy much

better than the size of the dots in fig. 3, one can check that the points actually lie slightly

o the line. this is shown more clearly in the ve dimensional results in fig. 4. once

again, the dashed curve is the continuation of the curve i = 8.63 t shown in fig. 1, and
the solid curve is the line i = 2.75 r+ that it approaches asymptotically.

4. conclusion

if i was granted three wishes in the subject of black holes in string theory, they would

be:

a) explain the 3/4 factor relating the weak and strong coupling calculations of the en-

tropy of the near extremal three-brane.

b) find an exact calculation of the entropy of a schwarzschild black hole.

c) understand how (whether?) the usual information loss arguments break down in the

evaporation of a small black hole.

we have already discussed (a). the current status of (b) is that there are general

arguments which relate uncharged black holes to excited string states, and show that the

entropy should be proportional to the horizon area [24,25]. but they are not yet able

11

to compute the numerical factor. finally, we mentioned that in terms of the ads/cft

correspondence, the evaporation of a small black hole in ads should be a unitary process

in the cft. but we do not yet understand how the usual semiclassical arguments for in-

formation loss break down. this might point toward a possible limitation of the ads/cft

correspondence, but is more likely just a result of our current lack of understanding of how

the cft describes the spacetime inside the horizon.
