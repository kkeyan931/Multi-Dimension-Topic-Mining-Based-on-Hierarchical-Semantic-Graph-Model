abstract

we consider an easy way to get the noncommutative spacetime in minkowski

space. this corresponds to introducing a magnetic eld b = bk in the

plane. we construct a greens function in coordinate space which includes

a moyal phase factor. the projection to the lowest landau level(lll) is

necessary for a simple calculation. using this greens function and a second

quantized formalism, we study the thermodynamic property of the anyons

on the noncommutative geometry. it turns out that the moyal phase factors

contribute to the thermodynamic potential  as opposed to the free-particle

nature.

i. introduction

gauge theories on noncommutative space are relevant to the quantization of d-branes

in background b elds [15]. the eect of noncommutativity is given in the momentum

space vertices as the from of moyal bracket phase. to derive this factor, the authors in ref.

[6] consider a dipole in a magnetic eld b. in the limit of strong magnetic eld (b ),
this dipole is frozen into the lowest landau level(lll). interaction of such dipoles include
the moyal bracket phase factor of eipq with p q = ijpiqj/b. however, in this process, the
dipole in a strong magnetic eld is turned out to be a galileian particle of mass m because

they neglect the kinetic terms.

it is important to note that the noncommutativity comes just from the presence of the

magnetic eld. the condition of strong makes the calculation easy and does not matter

with the noncommutativity. in this sense it is valuable to study a eld theory both in the

presence of a magnetic eld and in the coordinate space. actually one can derive the factor

of ei   from the operation tt

t t

 of magnetic translation operator(t ) [7]. this

 it
means that when an electron travels around a parallelogram generated by t t
picks up a phase  = 2/0 = bk  (   )     , where  is the magnetic ux in the
parallelogram and 0 = hc/e is the ux quantum. the only dierence between the momen-

tt

tum and coordinate spaces is the phase factor: in the momentum space it is proportional

to 1/b while in the coordinate space it is proportional to b. this is so because the correct

dimensions should be recovered. if we introduce the greens function in a magnetic eld and

in the coordinate space, this noncommutative situation is shown up clearly. for example,

the one particle greens function for a free particle is [8]

gf ree



(r2, r1) =

m

whereas the one in the lll is given by [9]

with c = e|b|/2mc and  = b/|b|. we note that gf ree
(r1, r2). but gb

is symmetric under (r2, r1) 
 no longer carries such a symmetry because of the presence of the phase



factor. the phase factor originates from a subtle, combined property of translation and

gauge transformation in the presence of magnetic eld(i.e., the magnetic translation).

in this paper, we study the nonrelativistic anyonic model as a model of (2+1)d eld

theory on the noncommutative geometry. this model has already introduced to study the

fractional statistics [10] and anyonic physics [8,9]. now we reconsider this model to explore

its hidden noncommutative property. we can regard this model as a simple model which

shows the noncommutativity. actually the noncommutativity appears as the matrix m in

the form of the anti-symmetric submatrix(dij).

ii. anyonic model in a magnetic field

we start with the lagrangian for an ideal gas of fractional particles (nonrelativistic

anyons) in a magnetic eld (b = bk) [10]

l =

n

xi=1(cid:20) m

2

x2

i + q xi  ai + q {a0(xi) + xi  ai}(cid:21) +

1

2 z d2x aa ,

(3)

where xi is the ith particle coordinates, q(charge= e), ai = ( b
2 xi, 0) with i ai =
b, ai(statistical gauge potential) and a0(scalar potential). the rst term is the kinetic term

2 yi, b

for nonrelativistic particles. the second one is their interaction with a magnetic eld. the

third term is their coupling with the statistical gauge potential. the last term is just the

chen-simons term which associates with each particle ctitious ux q.  plays a role of

the statistical parameter. the anyons are considered as identical particles (fermions or hard-

core bosons) with the ux q. on later, we need to introduce a harmonic potential term of

1

i=1

2m2r2

(pn
i ) to regularize the divergences [8,9]. then our model (3) is very similar to
(3) of ref. [6]. the dierence is that in our case all particles carry the same charge q = e,
but bigatti and susskind considered a dipole with harmonic interaction between the charges

to connect the string theory. further their way to lead the moyal phase factor is articial.

3

however we include this factor into the greens function without any vertex correction. using

this greens function, we study the anyons on the noncommutative geometry.

after some calculation, one nds the corresponding hamiltonian as

h =

1
2m

n

xi=1(cid:18)i +

e
c

ai(cid:19)2

,

where the mechanical momentum i is given by

i = pi +

e
c

ai

with the canonical momentum pi. and the statistical gauge potential ai takes the form

ai = 

e
c

n

xi6=j

k  rij
r2
ij

(4)

(5)

(6)

which satises the coulomb gauge condition i ai = 0 and i ai  bk. here we set h = 1
and k is the unit vector perpendicular to the plane. let us see how the noncommutativity

comes out from the presence of a magnetic eld. in the absence of a magnetic eld, the

commutator of the momentum i is given by

but in the presence of a magnetic eld the commutator leads to

[x

i , y

i ]b=0 = 0.

[x

i , y

i ]b6=0 = i

e

bij.

this is an easy way to get a noncommutative spacetime in the plane.

the schrodinger equation for the n anyon is

h(r1, ..., rn ) = e(r1,   , rn ).

(7)

(8)

(9)

we now treat the - and 2-anyonic interactions in (4) as the perturbations of the hamil-

tonian h 0:

h = h 0 + h,

h 0 =

(12)

here h 0 describes n particles (bosons or fermions) moving in the uniform magnetic eld.
as it stands, the model with h0 is very important.
nonrelativistic fermions in the presence of magnetic eld is relevant to the fractional quantum

in particular, the study of (2+1)d

hall eect(fqhe) [7]. such a system has a further connection with (1+1)d c = 1 string

model [11,12]. that is, a system of (2+1)d nonrelativistic fermions in the lll is dual to

a boundary system of (1+1)d nonrelativistic fermions (c = 1 string model). this is very

similar to the ads3/cft correspondence in the sense of the bulk/boundary dynamics [13].

there exists a conceptual diculty in doing the perturbation near  = 0. because of

the singular nature of the 2-interaction

and the fact that a wave function does not vanish when any two bosonic particles approach

each other (rij  0), a naive perturbation would lead to an innite energy shift [7,8]. in
order to overcome this diculty, we use the improved technique of the perturbation. the

singular nature of the interaction forces the real wave function to vanish when rij  0. hence
(r1, ..., rn ). one can easily
we redene the n-body wave function as (r1, ..., rn ) = qi<j r
show that all divergent terms in (13) disappear if  is equal to ||. it is worth noting that
the prefactor qi<j r||
ij can be interpreted as a factor which optimizes the dynamical short-
range avoidance between anyons. the resulting equation is (h 0 +  h)  = e . here the

perturbed hamiltonian  h is given by

 h =

(14)

the interaction terms in (14) are two-body interactions, contrary to (12) where three-body

interactions are present. this approach is based on the quantum-mechanical framework at

rst order in . for second and higher corrections, this is no longer useful. rather, it is

appropriate to use a quantum eld theory.

5

iii. second quantized formalism

in order to compute perturbatively the thermodynamic potential  in the grand canonical

ensemble, we introduce a second quantized formalism (nite-temperature quantum eld

theory) [7,8]. this formalism is also very useful for representing the magnetic translation

symmetry. the thermodynamic potential is given by

 = p v =  ln tre(hn ),

(15)

where h and n stand respectively for the second quantized hamiltonian and the number
operator of anyons, and  is the chemical potential [ z = exp()]. in terms of a second

quantized eld  the second quantized hamiltonian h takes the form
2 z dr1dr2(r1)(r2)v(r1  r2)(r2)(r1)

h = h0 +

with

h0 =

here v is the anyonic interaction given by

v(r1  r2) = v(r1, r2) + v(r2, r1),

(16)

(17)

(18)

the rst term (anyonic vertex) in (18) measures the energy change in the nonzero angular

momentum sector and materializes, only in the presence of a magnetic eld, in the virial

coecients. the second (short-range improved vertex) comes from optimizing the dynamical

short-range avoidance between anyons and measures the energy change in the zero angular

momentum sector. the last (constant vertex) couples the statistical parameter  to the

magnetic eld and plays a crucial role in cancellation of divergences. it is important to note

that the || term is not hermitian, and is complex as much as the anyonic vertex. instead,
we construct the simple hermitian vertex

6

v h (r1, r2) =

1

2 nv(r1, r2) + v (r1, r2)o .

(19)

(20)

the equivalence of the ||-term in v(r1, r2) and the ||-term in v h (r1, r2) was conrmed to
be valid at second order in  [8].

we treat  and || as small parameters and expand perturbatively the thermodynamic

potential  :

v(1) is the two-anyonic interaction built from the thermal second quantized eld

(r1, 1) = e1(h0n )(r1)e1(h0n ).

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

the upper index c in (21) means that one omits any disconnected diagram when using the

wick theorem. the wick theorem is performed through the one particle thermal greens

function [ (r1, 1)(r2, 2) ]. the thermal propagator in a power series of z is then

[(r1, 1)(r2, 2)] =

(25)

where 12 = 1  2 and h is the one particle hamiltonian. here  refers to bose/fermi
cases. when 12  0, s starts at s = 1; whereas when 12 < 0, it starts at s = 0. in the
lowest landau level of b  , the one-particle greens function at temperature s  12 is
:

(26)

we here consider the statistical mechanics of a gas of anyons in a strong magnetic eld, and

in the thermodynamic limit. a naive perturbative calculation of thermodynamic potential

consists in working with (26). however, the presence of a free-particle nature and a phase

factor in the exponent of (26) leads to the unwanted result (a divergent quantity). a good

regularization procedure should be introduced to resolve this problem by adding an extra

potential term of conning nature. for simplicity we introduce a harmonic regulator to

give an unambiguous meaning to all diagrams(fig.1 - fig.3). this amounts to adding to

(11) a term of pn

i and the thermodynamic limit is understood as   0. the
one-particle greens function at temperature s in a constant magnetic eld with a harmonic

it is sucient to consider up to the order of 6 to obtain the nite results. care has to

be taken regarding overall normalization. at a given power s of z, one has to multiply the

harmonic result by s in order to recover the large volume(area) limit of v  .

iv. moyal phase factor and greens function

hereafter we choose e/c = 1. the relevant symmetries of the unperturbed system (17) are

the translational and rotational ones. here we mainly concern the translational symmetry.

8

the hamiltonian h0 is invariant under a cocycle transformation which is dened through
its action over the eld operator as [14]

u (r, t)u1

 = exp(ia(r)   )(r   , t)  t (r, t),

(29)

where u is the unitary operator representing the translation in the second quantized fock

space. also the above is the dening equation of the magnetic translation operator t . from

(29) the generator(gc) of the cocycle transformation is derived as

t(r, t) = exp(i  gc(r))(r, t), gc(r) = p  a(r).

(30)

also from (17), gc is compared with the momentum  = p + a. for our purpose let us

introduce the complex coordinates as

z = s|b|

2

(x + iy), z = s|b|

2

(x  iy).

h = 2c(

here a(a) is an annihilation(creation) operator which mixes the landau levels. on the other

hand, b(b) is an annihilation(creation) operator within each landau level. the commutation

relations are given by

[a, a] = , [b, b] = ,

(37)

9

with all other commutators vanishing. the hamiltonian operator in (32) can be expressed

in terms of these operators as

h = 2c(aa +

).

the generator of the cocycle transformation in (30) takes the following form:

we also have t t
magnetic length dened by 1/l2 = |b| = b. this is a familiar feature of the group of
translations in a magnetic eld, because     is exactly the moyal phase generated by the
ux in the parallelogram of  and   plane. hence t s form a ray representation of the
magnetic translation group. in fact t translates the particle a distance k   . this means
t . how does
that dierent components of t do not commute. that is, t t

 = ei  t

the greens function accomodate this phase factor? introducing the ux  enclosed in the

parallelogram and 0 (ux quantum), then these take the forms as

 = b  (r2  r1),
0 =

uses this greens function to calculate any physical quantity, the eect of noncommutativity

is taken into account automatically. this can be done solely by the greens function without

manipulating vertices as in string theories [6].

10

v. structure of perturbation theory

here we observe the eect of the moyal phase factors on the calculation of thermodynamic

quantities. for simplicity, we choose the hermitian point vertex v h (r1, r2) = 
m||(r12).
this vertex minimizes the divergence problem in higher order corrections. and this repre-

sents the average anyonic eect.

a. first-order calculation

we are now in a position to derive the rst-order correction to 0 in (22). one has to

consider the two diagrams in fig.1. they correspond to two possible contractions in the

wick expansion

11

the rst term corresponds to the two-tadpole diagram and the second is the conventional

diagram. considering the point vertex of 

m||(r12), two terms lead to the same expression.

the diagrams in figs.2(e)-2(l) have one tadpole. if there exists a tadpole, one has to perform

the integral over the tadpole coordinate rst. then, the remaining gaussian integration will

be of the form of 6  6 matrix. consider the diagram of fig.2(e). applying the feynman
rules, the second-order correction to 0 is given by

it is easy to show that this leads to fig.2(m)

. in order to investigate the non-triviality of

this diagram in connection with the moyal phase factors, we introduce the constant vertex

of c/2 in (20). after integration over the tadpole coordinate r2, we perform the gaussian
integration over r1, r3 and r4. one obtains 3/det m6 where the matrix m6 is given by

m6 =

again, one nds that the determinant of m6 becomes a perfect aquare:

finally det m6 takes the form

qdet m6 = c11c33c44  c11(cid:16)c2

34 + d2

13 + d2

+2c34 (c13c14 + d13d14) + 2d34 (c13c14  d13d14) .

(61)

here we observe that the moyal phase factor(d2

ij) contribute to 2 as exactly opposed to the

free-particle nature(c2

ij). the last term is considered as a compositive term.

(3) diagrams without tadpole

diagrams in figs.2(a)-(d) and figs.3(a)-(d) belong to this category. in these cases one nds

that the integrand can be cast into the form as



4

xi,j=1

cijri  rj 

4

xi,j=1

exp


dij k  (ri  rj)


,

(62)

where cij involve the free-particle nature, whereas dij contain the moyal phase factors.
performing the gaussian integration over r1, r2, r3, r4, one obtains 4/det m8 with the
8  8 matrix

m8 = 


cij dij

dij cij




.

(63)

its determinant becomes a perfect square of the form det m = (det p + q)2 with det p =

det(cij) and q = q(cij, dij) [9]. after some manipulation, det m can be lead to the similar

form as in (61).

vi. discussions

in this paper, we study the eect of moyal phase factors on the thermodynamic potential

using the anyonic model in the presence of a magnetic eld.

in this case, we use the

coordinate space greens function including the moyal phase factor without manipulating

the vertices. it turns out that the moyal phase factors contribute to the thermodynamic

potential  as opposed to the free-particle nature. moyal phase factors are encoded in

the antisymmetric submatrix(dij), whereas the free-particle properties are encoded in the

symmetric submatrix(cij, i 6= j). the diagonal elements of cij denote the regularization
scheme.

in connection with string theory, we compare our model with bigatti and susskinds case

[6]. they introduced a dipole with two opposite charges and harmonic interaction( k

2 r2

12)

between them in the presence of the strong magnetic eld [15]. they also neglected the

kinetic terms and introduce the interaction potential v (r1) = (r1) by hand to extract the

moyal phase factor. in the quantum level, they derived the moyal bracket phase eipq as

vertex correction in the momentum space. here we use the n particles with the same charge
q = e and a harmonic regulating potential( 1
i ). further we use the hermitian point
vertex (v h = 
m||(r12)) to study the higher order corrections. then the moyal phase
factors are included in the greens function and thus we dont need to correct the vertex.

although our model seems not to connect with the string theory, this shows clearly the

noncommutative eect on the thermodynamic potential.
