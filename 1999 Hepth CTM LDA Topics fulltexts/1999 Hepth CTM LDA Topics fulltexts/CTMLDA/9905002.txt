(2.15) (2.15), see k must integer. otherwise contour integrals would ill-dened. moreover, k must positive annihilated hn n > 0. particular, h0 acts claimed before. similarly, en act en(cid:0)o(cid:1) = ic0 dz2icz2 dz1 (z12)nk 2ei2en(i12)(z1)vkei(z2) . (2.16) first let us note contour integrals well-dened 2 z. considering e+ n n 0, see integrands non-singular 0. thus generators annihilate o. hand, negative powers z12 may arise en n > 0 unless 2 k. therefore, highest weight vectors exist = 0, 1/2, . . . , k/2, course desired result exactly values k dene unitary representations (see (2.6)). thus built highest weight vectors su(2) algebra dened (2.2). remains show verma modules generated vectors contain string vertex operators. done inductively, using fact hn, en stringy. take, example, hn(cid:0)o(cid:1) lmhn(cid:0)o(cid:1) = hnlm(cid:0)o(cid:1) = 0 taking cocycle factor account,  =  =   = 0 . easily repeated general state verma module. built unitary highest weight representations su(2). point, couple comments order.
