abstract

we study f 4-threshold corrections in an eight dimensional s-dual pair of string
theories, as a prototype of dual string vacua with sixteen supercharges. we show
that the orbifold cft description of d-string instantons gives rise to a perturbative
expansion similar to the one appearing on the fundamental string side. by an
explicit calculation, using the nambu-goto action in the static gauge, we show that
the rst subleading term agrees precisely on the two sides. we then give a general
argument to show that the agreement extends to all orders.

under the type i/heterotic duality map, length scales are related by lh = li /i , with
i the type i string coupling constant and lh, li heterotic and type i scales, respectively.
this implies, in particular, that an expansion in the large volume limit of a toroidal
compactied heterotic theory can be translated to a genus expansion on the type i side.
in [1] the exact moduli depence of f 4 and r4 terms in the low energy eective actions
for toroidal compactications of heterotic string to d  5 dimensions was computed.
these terms are special in the sense that they are related by supersymmetry to cp
odd couplings, for which only one-loop perturbative corrections are possible [2]. it is
therefore expected that this is also the case for their supersymmetric partners. moreover,
for d  5, the only non-perturbative object on the heterotic side, which is the vebrane
instanton, is always innitely massive to give contribution. therefore one expects that
the one-loop result is exact even non-perturbatively. the one-loop formula can be
expressed, in the type i variables, as a sum of a nite number of perturbative corrections
and an innite series of d-string instanton contributions. indeed, for d  5, the d-
string instanton is the only source of non-perturbative contributions on the type i side.
the form of the n-instanton contribution in this sum suggests that it can be read
o from the o(n ) gauge theory describing n nearby d-strings, whose worldsheets are
wrapped on a two-torus [4]. more precisely, the leading behaviour in the volume of
the compactication torus for the so(32) f 4 and r4 gauge and gravitational couplings
respectively were shown in agreement [4] with the exact formula found in a perturbative
computation in the heterotic side [3]. similar results were found in [5], where the moduli
dependence for o(2, 2) f 4 gauge couplings, for the gauge elds coming from the kk
reduction of the metric and antisymmetric tensor, were considered in a class of orientifold
models with 16 supercharges. also, higher derivative couplings involving graviphotons
have been recently discussed in [6]. in all the cases, the d-string instanton coupling
to the gauge elds are obtained from the classical d-string instanton action, while the
contributions from quantum uctuations around the d-string instanton background are
encoded in the elliptic genus of the corresponding o(n ) gauge theory.

the perturbative computations of [3, 5] show that, on top of the leading d-string instan-
ton corrections, there are a nite number of contributions corresponding to perturbative
corrections in the d-string instanton background. one can ask the question whether
the cft describing the infrared limit of the d-string gauge theory captures some in-
formation about these subleading terms. the aim of this letter is to show that this
is indeed the case. we will perform our analysis in the simplest context of the eigth
dimensional dual pair obtained via an orbifold/orientifold of type iib theory considered
in [5]. the dual orbifold/orientifold actions are dened by the orbifold ()flv (fun-
damental side) and orientifold v (type i side) z2 actions, with v a shift of order
two in the two torus.

let us rst start by briey reviewing the computation of the moduli dependence of
f 4 couplings in the the fundamental side and how the result agrees, at the leading

1

order in a large volume expansion, with what one gets from the cft describing the
d-string system. we will subsequently show that the cft description also gives rise
to a perturbative expansion which has the same structure as the one appearing on the
fundamental string side. in particular, we will show a perfect agreement for the rst
subleading correction.
the f 4 couplings we are intersted in are obtained from the one-loop string amplitudes:

denote with capital indices m = (, i) the ten dimensional noncompact  = 0, 1, . . . 7
and compact i = 8, 9 directions. the combinations with the minus sign represent the
graviphoton vertex operators, which carry always additional power of momenta and are
therefore irrelevant for the computation of f 4 couplings. it is convenient to dene a
generating function z(i, ,  ), in term of which the above amplitudes read:

where gij and bn

the theory we are considering involves half shift along x 8 direction, it is convenient
to replace the radius r8 by 2r8. indeed this new radius is what appears on the dual
iib/v theory (upto the scaling by the string coupling constant). as a result t , u

along 1 and 2 are integer valued.

specic orbifold sector, while m2, n2 run over all integers. we denote the three relevant
sectors: n1 odd, m1 odd and both odd by  = +,+, respectively. the untwisted
sector,  = ++, will not contribute, since it has too many zero modes to be soaked by
the four vertex insertions at this order in the momenta. note that, due to the existence
of these dierent sectors, the duality group  on u is not the full sl(2, z) group but

which reduces the sum over all wrapping mode congurations in a given sl(2, z) orbit
to a single integration over an unfolded domain. the unfolded domains are either the
strip or the upper half plane depending on whether the orbit is degenerate (det w = 0)
or non degenerate (det w 6= 0). in [3, 5] these contributions were identied with the
perturbative and d-string instanton corrections respectively in the type i side. the
result for the non-degenerate contributions were written as [5]

is exactly reproduced by a direct computation of d-instanton contributions in the type

minant m1n2 of the representative matrices m , while dierent wrapping mode cong-
urations labelled by m1, n1, n2 are mapped to l, s, m , describing the dierent sectors
of the orbifold conformal eld theory to which the eective o(n ) gauge theory ows in
the infrared. the coupling of the n d-instanton background to the f8, f9 gauge elds

where t f = 1
i=1 si are the fermionic zero modes
corresponding to the center of mass of the n copies of d-string worldsheets. indeed,
bringing down four powers of these terms, we soak the eight fermionic zero modes and
combining with the quantum d-instanton partition function 1
l ),
the perturbative result (14) is reproduced. note that the center of mass fermions here
are dened with unconventional normalization in order to make the comparison with the
fundamental string side more transparent. in this normalization the partition function
appears with m4 as stated above. had we used the canonical denition of the center
of mass fermion zero modes, then we would have had a factor l4 instead of m4 in the
partition function. the easiest way to see the appearance of l4 in the partition function
is by examining the short string sector l = 1, m = n , where one can unambiguously
calculate the partition function using operator formalism. since the zn projection
implies that the momenta pi of each string is equal (to p say) the partition function
appears with en u2p2
which upon integration over p yields a factor 1/n 4. this cancels
the factor n 4 coming from the trace over canonically normalized fermionic zero modes
(other than the center of mass ones). in the general (l, m ) sectors the factor l4 is then
xed by modular transformations. now one can rescale the canonically normalized zero
modes by 1/n which gives rise to a jacobian 1/n 4 giving rise to the partition function
claimed above.

the exact formula (11) shows the presence of t2-subleading terms which should corre-
spond to a nite number of perturbative corrections around the n d-instanton back-
ground.

stood as acting on the coecient of 4r in the expansion of the function inside the

we would like now to show how these corrections can be reproduced by the eective
d-string instanton action. to this aim, we start with the d-string instanton action in
the presence of constant eld strength background for the gauge elds gi, bi under
consideration. each eld strength appears in the action with two fermion zero modes
and therefore the amplitude is obtained by extracting the 8 fermion zero modes in the
partition function. one immediately encounters two problems:

5

1) one needs to keep in the action higher order terms in the fermion zero modes.
unfortunately in curved backgrounds the covariant green-schwarz actions that exist
in the literature include only terms upto quartic in fermions, with higher order terms
in principle being calculable using space-time supersymmetry and kappa symmetry.
on dimensional grounds, as will become clear in the following, each pair of fermion
zero modes appears with 1/t2 and therefore, such higher order terms can contribute
to order 1/t 2
in the absence of
information on such higher order terms we will be restricted below to calculate only the
rst subleading correction. however later we will argue that the complete action should
correctly reproduce the full perturbative expansion.

2 correction (compared to the leading order term).

2) even upto the terms quartic in fermion elds, the green-schwarz action presupposes
that the background elds satisfy the supergravity equations of motion. of course
constant eld strengths satisfy the gauge eld equations, however they can contribute to
the stress energy tensor and therefore can modify the classical equations for dilaton and
the 8-dimensional metric. however this problem will not appear if we restrict ourselves
to the rst subleading correction in 1/t2. indeed as seen from equation (20), the rst
subleading term appears in two ways: 1) for  = 0 (ie. fz = 0) there is a correction
coming from the rst order expansion of 1/(t2  
2 ). this can get contribution from
terms in the action that are quadratic in f z. for fz = 0 arbitrary constant values
of f z will solve the equations of motion since the resulting stress energy tensor is
zero. 2) the rst order in  already comes with 1/t 2
2 and therefore does not require an
2 )2. this means that in the action we need to include
expansion of the term 1/(t2  
only the rst order term in both the f s which certainly solves the linearized equations
of motion. all the expessions in the following should be understood to make sense only
in the rst subleading term in 1/t2.
the green-schwarz, covariant world-sheet action for a single string coupled to the n =
1, 10-d supergravity multiplet, is given by [9] ( = 1

(22)

the dots above indicate terms involving 6 and higher powers of fermion elds. here
we have directly rewritten the action of [9] in the nambu-goto form, by using the
equations of motion for the world-sheet metric. the resulting induced metric gab and
the antisymmetric coupling rab are given by:

we then proceed by choosing the static gauge, which amounts to identing the eu-
clidean world-sheet complex coordinates z  122
(1 +  2), z, with the spacetime
torus coordinates x z  122
(x 8 + u x 9), x z respectively and the complex structure
of the world-sheet torus,  , with that of the spacetime torus, u .
in addition, local

ai from the expansion of (22) and then set gi to zero, we can set always gi to zero
unless a derivative hits on it. this is so because such terms would anyway disappear in
the nal result due to gauge invariance. furthermore since the connections involve at
most one derivative of the metric, the terms containing two or more derivatives of gi
are irrelevant for our present discussion. here and in the following we will always set
these components to zero.

1strictly speaking, because of the majorana-weyl nature of fermions, the gauge xing condition
makes sense only in the minkowski space-time (and world-sheet). we assume that x 9 is time like in
which case z and z are real light-like coordinates and 2 and u2 are imaginary. at the very end we will
do the analytic continuation back to complex  and u

2notice that precisely this combination appears in the connections in (24)

using the ansatz (26), and recalling from [5] that, after orientifolding,  is periodic (and
therefore has 8 zero modes, denoted by 0), whereas  is anti-periodic, it can be seen
that the contributions of interest in (23) come from two kind of terms, 0 z k l  k l

in the above formulae and in the following z and z denote so(2) gamma matrices and
the t2 dependence will be explicitely displayed. contributions to the f 4 couplings will
come from the d-instanton partition function once four powers of these combinations
are brougth down to soak the 8 fermionic zero modes. this is why we replaced the
fermions in (27,28) by their zero mode part 0. f 4 couplings will be dened then by
the fourth order terms in the ,  expansion of the resulting eective action. the two

we have considered so far the nambu-goto action for a single d-string. the results (29)
can however easily be generalized to the n d-string case. the low energy eective action
describing the excitations of the n d-string system is described by o(n ) gauge theory
studied in [5]. as argued in that reference, after integrating out the very massive degrees
of freedom in the infrared limit, we are left with an eective conformal eld theory in

the moduli dependence of f 4 couplings in the n d-instanton background are then

the fermionic bilinears 2, 2  with our previous sources , , one can show that the
perturbative results (17), (18) are reproduced.

precisely the virasoro generator of an innitesimal shift in the z worldsheet coordinate,
l0, which couples to u . therefore its insertions translate into covariant derivatives d u

the rst subleading term in 1/t2 the fact that the  coupling appears with the same
normalization factor

as in the perturbative result (17) is quite remarkable.

the calculation above shows the precise matching of the rst subleading correction
around d-string instantons with the exact result on the fundamental string side. how
can we extend this to all orders in 1/t f
2 ? the steps involved are two fold. first of all,
we will need terms upto 8th order in fermion zero modes in the covariant green-schwarz
action. this can in principle be obtained by repeatedly using space-time supersymmetry
and kappa symmetry. secondly, we need to solve the linearized equation for  in the
presence of arbitrary . this will involve turning on 8-dimensional gravitational and
dilaton elds to the rst order in . although straightforward, the computation involved
is rather cumbersome. we will give here an alternative argument to show that the
complete action should correctly reproduce the full perturbative expansion. for n =
1 the covariant d-string action is the same as the fundamental string action. the
static gauge computation presented here should be the same as the light cone gauge
computation in the fundamental string side provided one restricts to detw = 1 in
equation (20). this shows that at least for single instanton the two results should agree
to all orders in 1/t2. for n > 1, the orbifold cft description implies that the result is
obtained from the n = 1 result by applying the hecke operator hn , upto n dependent
factors. indeed, by the zero mode argument of [10, 5], one knows that only the twisted
sectors of the form (l)m contribute and the resulting expression involves the sum over
l, m, s. modular covariance in u under the subgroup  then xes the powers of l in the
sum over the sectors, giving rise to hecke operator hn . the only quantity which is not
xed in the amplitude h f rf 4ri by this argument is the n dependence of the leading
as well as the subleading terms in 1/t f
2 for each r. to determine this n dependence we
note that the general form of the n d-string action in the orbifold limit is schematically
of the form

decouple in the infrared limit. the powers of t f

to summarize, we have studied the perturbative corrections around d-string instan-
tons and have shown that there is an expansion similar to the one appearing on the
fundamental string side.
in particular by an explicit analysis of the supersymmetric
nambu goto action in static gauge that appears in the orbifold cft, the rst sublead-
ing term was shown to agree precisely on the two sides. we further argued by studying
the n dependence of the general form of nambu goto action containing higher powers
of fermion zero modes, that the complete perturbative expansion is reproduced by the
d-string instantons. thus our results show that the orbifold cft description of the
d-string instantons captures also these perturbative corrections.

the results presented here are restricted to the simplest example of eight dimensional
dual pairs with sixteen supercharges, among the ones studied in [3], [5]. this model is
however a convenient prototype for all of them (type i-heterotic, chl-type i with non
commuting wilson lines, etc.) and we believe that these results extend in a straight-
forward way to all the cases in which the precise matching between fundamental and
d-string bps excitations has been stablished.

the fact that we can compute perturbative corrections around d-string instanton back-
grounds by inserting operators that are not of dimension (1,1) (in the present context
the stress-energy tensor t (z)) is quite remarkable and we believe it deserves a deeper
study.
as in the previous studies [3], [5], this analysis was restricted to d > 4. for d  4
the ve-brane physics becomes relevant. this is of course another exciting direction to
explore.
