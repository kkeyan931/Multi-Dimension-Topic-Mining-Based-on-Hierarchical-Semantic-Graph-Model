1. introduction

topological defects play an important role in many physical systems ranging from cos-
mology to condensed matter. thus they link apparently unrelated areas characterized by
very dierent energy and time scales.

the issue of spontaneous defect formation during symmetry breaking phase transitions
has recently attracted much attention [1]. as originally pointed out by kibble [2] and more
recently by zurek [3], dierent regions of a system may be unable to correlate during the
quench time which characterizes the transition and, as a result, some parts of space may
remain trapped in the original (symmetric) phase, giving rise to topological defects.

although the kibblezurek mechanism gives a reasonable estimate of the defect density
as a function of the quench time (as conrmed, for instance, by recent experiments on
superuid helium [4]), this picture is essentially phenomenological. it is clear that a full
understanding of the process of defect formation requires a full quantum eld theoretical
formulation of the problem. there has recently been much progress in this direction [5], and
here we give some novel results based on the approach which we are currently developing.
a more systematic account will be presented in two forthcoming papers [6,7].

we are inspired by the work done in the 70s by umezawa et al. [8], who showed how
solitons can arise in qft as result of a localized (inhomogeneous) condensation of particles.
in this picture the extended objects have an inherently quantum origin. the corresponding
classical soliton solutions are then obtained in the   0 limit.
following these ideas we construct a qft of topological defects using the closedtime
path (ctp) formalism [9]. the latter is a vital ingredient of our construction, as it has a
natural extension to nite temperature and to nonequilibrium situations (which is relevant
for example in realistic phase transitions).

the paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we give a brief account of ctp formalism
and of some fundamentals of qft which are essential to what follows. in section 3, we
consider a simple model, namely 4 in 2 d (i.e.1 + 1), showing how the kink solution can
be constructed at zero and nite temperature. in section 4, we discuss the vortex solution
for 4d complex 4 theory. we conclude in section 5.

2. the haag expansion in closedtimepath formalism

let us consider the dynamics of an heisenberg eld described by

(x) = i[h, (x)]

,

(x) = i[h, (x)] ,

(1)

where  is the momentum conjugate to  and h is the full (renormalized) hamiltonian in
the heisenberg picture. assuming that the heisenberg and interaction pictures coincide at
some time ti, we can write the formal solution of eqs.(1) as (in denotes quantities in the
interaction picture)

(x) = z 1/2

 1(t) in(x) (t)

, (x) = z 1/2

 1(t) in(x) (t)

(2)

(t) = ei(tti)h 0

d4xhi

t1

in ei(tti)h , u(t2; t1) = (t2) 1(t1) = t (cid:26)exp(cid:20)iz t2

in(x)(cid:21)(cid:27) (3)
where hi
in is the interacting hamiltonian, t is the time ordering and z, z are the wave
function renormalizations (usually   , and so z = z). eqs.(2) must be understood
if not, we would get the canonical commutator between  and  equal
in a weak sense:
to iz3(x  y). this would imply z = 1, whilst the kallen-lehmann representation
requires z < 1. the solution of this problem is well known, the hilbert spaces for 
and in are unitarily inequivalent, and the wave function renormalizations z and/or z
then indicate how much the unitarity is violated [10]. thus, the choice of the in and of
the associated hilbert space is not unique: selecting a particular set of in corresponds to
dening a particular physical situation, i.e. initialtime data for the operator equation (1).
we will use this feature to construct a qft which contains topological defects.
if derivatives of elds are not present in li (and thus hi = li) we can write
in(x)(cid:21)(cid:27) .
(x) = z 1/2

 tc(cid:26)in(x) exp(cid:20)izc

 u(ti; t) in(x) u 1(ti; t) = z 1/2

d4xli

(4)

here c denotes a closedtime (schwinger) contour (see fig.1), running from ti to a later
time tf and back again. tc denotes the corresponding timepath ordering symbol.

in the limit ti  , in becomes the usual in(or asymptotic) eld. since tf is
arbitrary, it is useful to set tf = +. eq.(4) is the so called haag expansion, for the
heisenberg eld  [9].

3. kinks in twodimensional 4 theory

in this section we apply the formal considerations developed above to a specic model,
namely the 2d 4 theory both at zero and nite temperature. let us consider the following
lagrangian (we adopt the minkowski signature (+)):

the heisenberg equation of the motion for the eld  is

(2 + 2)(x) = 3(x) .

for 2 < 0, this model admits at a classical level kink solutions. dening

(x) = v + (x)

with v = h0|(x)|0i , 22 = m2 , 2 = v2 ,

we obtain

note that m2 > 0. the asymptotic eld (at t  ) now satises

(2 + m2)in(x) = 0 .

the haag expansion for the eld  reads (we suppress the renormalization factor z)

with f being a cnumber function. it is known [11] that such a canonical transformation
induces an inhomogeneous condensation of in quanta.

in fulls the same asymptotic equations as the unshifted eld in we

may equally well use it as initialtime data for . in this case the haag expansion reads

where c(x; y) = htc[in(x)in(y)]i (h. . .i  h0| . . .|0i where |0i is the vacuum for the
in eld). we now take the vacuum expectation value (vev) of eq.(15), use the relation

classical kinks at zero temperature

let us now deal with the born, or classical, approximation of (18). for this purpose we

keep only nite parts in c and d terms in the   0 limit. we then get:

(25)

this recurrence relation belongs to the class of the so called functional equations of cauchy
marleys type [12,13] whose fundamental solution cannot be expressed (apart from a very
narrow class of kernels) in terms of elementary functions. this means that we cannot hope
to resolve (25) in terms of general k (or f ). we can however obtain analytical solutions of
the classical version of eq.(7) - the analytical kinks. these may be obtained if we realize
that the convolution of the 2d retarded greens function gr(x) with an exponential is
proportional to the very same exponential. thus, if q1(x) = f (x) is an exponential, fourier
nontransformable, solution of eq.(13), we have qn(x)  (q1(x))n and

qn(x) = anf n(x) = an emn(x1x0u) ,

(26)

where  = (1  u2) 1

2 . plugging this form into (25) we arrive at the following equation

classical kinks at nite temperature

let us now concentrate on the nite temperature case. it is important to understand
what happens with the topological defects if the system is immersed in a heat bath at
temperature t .

the crucial observation at nite temperature is that the operatorial wicks theorem still
holds [17] and thus eq.(15) retains its validity provided ( . . .  denotes thermal average)
(31)

c(x, y) = h0|tc(in(x)in(y))|0i  c(x, y; t ) =  tc(in(x)in(y))  ,

together with : . . . :  n(. . .). the thermal normal ordering n(. . .) is dened is such a
way [17] that  n(. . .) = 0. this is of a great importance as all the previous formal
considerations go through also for nite t .
at nite temperature the question of  appearance is more delicate than in the zero
temperature case. the whole complication is hidden in the thermal propagator c(x, y; t ).
to understand this, let us make  explicit. the free thermal propagator in spectral or millss
representation [18,19] then reads

ic(x, y; t ) = z d2k

(2)2 eik(xy) (k)[c(x0  y0) + fb(k0/t )]

= ic(x, y; 0) + it

c(x, y) ,

(32)

where the spectral density (k) = (2)(k0) (k2  m2) with (k0) = (k0)  (k0). the
contour step function c(x0  y0) is 1 if y0 precedes x0 along the contour c. the bose
einstein distribution fb(x) = (ex  1)1. to calculate res0 we need to perform a laurent
expansion of fb around , i.e.

4. vortices in fourdimensional 4 theory

in this section we sketch the treatment of the 4d complex 4 theory in presence of
vortices. for a more thorough discussion see ref. [7]. we show how the vortex solution
can be obtained by shifting both the elds of the massless (goldstone) mode and of the
massive (unstable) mode: the appearance of a topological charge is controlled by the shift of
the goldstone eld only. we consider the ginzburglandau type lagrangian for a charged
scalar eld:

l =   2 


4||2 .

the (unrenormalized) equations of motion for the heisenberg operator  read

(cid:18) + 2 +



2|(x)|2(cid:19) (x) = 0 .

(35)

(36)

we assume symmetry breaking, i.e. 2 < 0 and hi = v = p22/. we parametrize the
eld as (x)  ((x) + v)ei(x), where both the elds  and  are hermitian and have zero
vev. we also put g =  and m2 = v2 > 0. the equations of motion for  and  read

g 3 = v ()2

(cid:2)  ()2 + m2(cid:3)  +
(cid:2)( + v)2(cid:3) = 0 .

we now choose as the relevant asymptotic elds the ones described by the equations

(37)

(38)

(39)

(40)

(cid:2)  (in)2 + m2(cid:3) (in + v) = 0
(cid:2)(in + v)2 in(cid:3) = 0 ,

i.e. ( + m2) in = 0 , where we have used in  (in + v) eiin. this means that the
interaction lagrangian density is

li = (m2  2) 


4||2 = 2m2v  gm3

m2v2 .

the corresponding haag expansion for the heisenberg eld operator  is then

(x)  ((x) + v)ei(x) = tc(cid:26)(in(x) + v)eiin(x) exp(cid:20)izc

d4yli

in(y)(cid:21)(cid:27) .

(41)

(42)

as before, the solutions of the asymptotic equations (39) and (40) are not unique. indeed,
we may dene the following shifted elds:

in(x)  f
in(x)  g

in(x) = in(x) + f (x)

in(x) = in(x) + g(x) ,

(43)

(44)

satisfying the same equations as the ones for the unshifted elds. the cnumber functions
h  f + v and g solve the coupled equations:
7

(cid:2)  h(in(x))2i  (g(x))2 + m2(cid:3) h(x) = m2v
(cid:2)(cid:0)h2

ini + h2(x)(cid:1) g(x)(cid:3) = 0 .

the haag expansion for  in terms of the new asymptotic elds reads

f,g(x) = tc(cid:26)(f

in(x) + v)eig

in(x) exp(cid:20)izc

d4yli f

in (y)(cid:21)(cid:27) ,

(45)

(46)

(47)

by construction the eld f,g(x) satises the same heisenberg equations as the eld (x).
a particular choice of solutions of eqs.(45), (46) can lead to the description of a particular
physical situation, e.g. of a system with topological defects. observe that in (47) the whole
dependence on g factorises out of tc.

let us now consider the vev of the heisenberg operator (47), i.e. the order parameter:

hf,g(x)i  eig(x) ff (x) = eig(x)h0|tc(cid:26)(f

in(x) + v)eiin(x)exp(cid:20)izc

d4yli f

in (y)(cid:21)(cid:27)|0i. (48)

in the classical approximation, the order parameter satises

(cid:2)  (g(x))2 + m2 + f 2
(cid:2)f 2

f (x)g(x)(cid:3) = 0 .

f (x)(cid:3) ff (x) = 0

(49)

(50)

this is nothing but the well known vortex equations [21]. a particular solution  a static
vortex along the third axis  is obtained taking ff (x) time independent with a radial de-
pendence only. eq.(50) then reduces to the laplace equation having the polar angle as
solution:

x1(cid:19) ,
g(x) = n (x) = n tan1(cid:18)x2

(51)

where the integer n guarantees the single valuedness of the order parameter hf,g(x)i. ff (r)
then fulls the following (static) equation:

r +

(cid:20)2

1
r

r 

n2

r2 + m2(cid:21) ff (r) = f 3

f (r) .

(52)

at this point we can use the fact that the function g appearing in the vortex equations
(49), (50) and in the equations for the shift functions (45), (46) is the same: we pick up
the solution of the static vortex equation and plug it into the shift equations(45), (46) to
determine1 the other shift function, f . let us denote this solution by f. then the expression
for the heisenberg operator in the presence of a static vortex at x = 0 will be

1in doing this, we use the renormalized equations, thus the terms with the vev will drop. the
notation is kept in (45), (46) since in general these terms are present (eg. at nite temperature as
thermal averages).

8

vort.(x) = tc(cid:26)(cid:16)in(x) + f (r(x)) + v(cid:17) eiin(x)+in(x) exp(cid:20)izc

d4yli f

in (y)(cid:21)(cid:27) .

(53)

this expression can be used as a starting point for further analysis [7]. here we only
consider the simplest approximation, i.e. we completely neglect the radial dependence by
setting f = 0. then the following relation holds:

(x)  ein(x) (x) ,

(54)

from which also follows the relation between greens functions with and without vortices (x
and y are far from the vortex core):

g(x, y)  h0|t ((x)(y))|0i  ein[(x)(y)] g(x  y) .

(55)

it is interesting to note that a similar relation can be derived for a systems of (charged)
particles in a bohmaharonov potential. in this case, one has [22]:

ga(x, y) = eie[(x)(y)] g0(x, y) ,

(56)

where the bohmaharonov potential is that induced by a magnetic ux = n times the
elementary magnetic ux:

a =  ,

i ds  a = 2n/e .

in the case of a vortex line of strength n we also have, beside eq.(55):

j = n

,

i ds  j = 2n .

(57)

(58)

thus the duality correspondence reads n(x)  e(x) and j  ea.
5. conclusions

we have developed a eld theoretical (operator) formalism suitable for the description
of quantum systems containing (topological) defects. the use of the closedtimepath for-
mulation is crucial in our approach, since it allows to treat systems both at zero temperature
or in thermal equilibrium as well as systems out of equilibrium.

we have applied our method to 4 theory in 2d and 4d cases.

in 2d case, kink
solutions were studied at zero and at nite temperature. in 4d case, vortex solution was
shown to arise from a inhomogeneous condensation of goldstone modes; an analogy with
bohmaharonov eect was discussed.
