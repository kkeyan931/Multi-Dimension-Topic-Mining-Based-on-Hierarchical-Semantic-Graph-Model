zero locus reduction of the brst differential

m. a. grigoriev

abstract. i point out an unexpected relation between the bv (batalinvilkovisky) and the bfv
(batalinfradkinvilkovisky) formulations of the same pure gauge (topological) theory. the non-
minimal sector in the bv formulation of the topological theory allows one to construct the poisson
bracket and the brst charge on some lagrangian submanifold of the bv conguration space; this
lagrangian submanifold can be identied with the phase space of the bfv formulation of the same
theory in the minimal sector of ghost variables. the bfv poisson bracket is induced by a natural
even poisson bracket on the stationary surface of the master action, while the brst charge origi-
nates from the bv gauge-xed brst transformation dened on a gauge-xing surface. the inverse
construction allows one to arrive at the bv formulation of the topological theory starting with the
bfv formulation. this correspondence gives an intriguing geometrical interpretation of the non-
minimal variables and claries the relation between the hamiltonian and lagrangian quantization
of gauge theories.
this is an extended version of the talk given at the qfthep-99 workshop in moscow, may 27 
june 2, 1999

1. introduction

the aim of this talk is to outline an unexpected relation between the batalinvilkovisky [1]
quantization and its hamiltonian counterpart known as the the batalinfradkinvilkovisky quan-
tization [2]. i investigate the pure gauge sector of a gauge theory. the relevant models are the
topological theories, i.e. the theories all of whose degrees of freedom are gauge ones. to anticipate
the result, the correspondence is based on the zero locus reduction [3, 4], i.e., the construction of an
even (odd) poisson bracket on the zero locus of the odd nilpotent vector eld on the (anti)symplectic
manifold.

a geometrical counterpart of the bv quantization conguration space (see [12][16] for the ge-
ometrically covariant formulation of the bv formalism) is the qp manifold (the manifold equipped
with an antibracket and a compatible odd nilpotent vector eld q; in the bv context, q is usually
given by q = (s,  ), where s is the bv master action satisfying the master equation (s, s) = 0).
as shown in [3, 4], the zero locus of the odd vector eld q on a qp manifold is an even symplectic
manifold, provided the appropriate nondegeneracy condition is imposed on q. in the bv context,
the zero locus zq of q = (s,  ) is the stationary surface of the master action s.

on the other hand, the construction proposed in [6, 5],

(1.1)

{f, g} = (f, (s, g)) ,

(s, s) = 0 ,

1

zero locus reduction

2

expresses the grassmann-even operations through the antibracket and the solution s to the master
equation. it was shown there that (1.1) is a poisson bracket provided one denes it on the subalgebra
of functions that are commutative w.r.t. the antibracket. moreover, the binary operation (1.1)
induces a lie algebra structure on the space of gauge symmetries in the bv formalism [6] (see
also [4]). it was also observed in [4] that (1.1) is a well dened operation in the algebra of smooth
functions on the zero locus zq considered as the quotient of all functions modulo those vanishing
on zq.

an important observation of [8, 9] is that (1.1) has an even counterpart. indeed, one can consider
an even poisson bracket and an odd nilpotent vector eld that preserves the poisson bracket;
then the structure (1.1) with the antibracket replaced by the even poisson bracket determines
an antibracket similarly to how (1.1) determines a poisson bracket. the zero locus of the odd
nilpotent hamiltonian vector eld on an even symplectic supermanifold is therefore endowed with
an antibracket [7].1

since the zero locus itself is an (odd) poisson (super)manifold, one can try to make it into a qp
manifold. however, if we start with a general qp manifold, there are no additional structures that
could induce an odd nilpotent vector eld on the zero locus (since q vanishes on zq, it induces
only the trivial q-structure on zq). a possible way to make zq into a qp manifold is to solve the
equation

(s, s) = 0 p(s) = 0,

or

( {, } = 0 p() = 1 )

in either the odd or the even case; this is the generating equation for the odd nilpotent vector elds
on zq. in this way, one arrives at various relations between dierent qp manifolds. this approach
is developed in [7], where it is also interpreted in terms of lie algebra (co)homology.

my claim is that there exists an alternative way to equip the zero locus of q with an odd
nilpotent vector eld. this approach is more restrictive but more relevant as regards applications
in the brst quantization. namely, it can be possible to reduce to the zero locus not only the
bracket structure but also the brst dierential. this reduction can be viewed as a procedure
relating the bv conguration space and the bfv phase space of the same pure gauge model;
the bv antibracket and the bv-quantization brst dierential q = (s,  ) induce the bfv phase
space structures (the poisson bracket and the corresponding brst dierential qbf v = {,  }) on
the zero locus of q = (s,  ). in what follows, i will refer to this relation as the zero locus reduction
of the brst dierential.

1another interesting feature of the even analogue of (1.1) is that it expresses the odd bracket through the even
one and therefore, quantizing the even bracket one can arrive at the quantum counterpart of the antibracket [8]. the
quantization amounts to replacing the poisson brackets in (1.1) with the commutator. we do not discuss this very
interesting subject here, however.

2. qp-manifolds

the notion of the qp manifold was introduced in [13, 3] as the geometrical structure underlying
the bv quantization. in fact, a similar structure (with the antibracket replaced by the ordinary
poisson bracket) underlies the bfv quantization. i now give a unied denition.

denition 2.1. a qp manifold is a supermanifold m equipped with a nondegenerate antibracket
(poisson bracket) (  ,  ) and an odd nilpotent vector eld q satisfying

(2.1)

q(f, g)  (qf, g)  (1)p(f )+p((,))(f, qg) = 0 , f, g  fm ,

with fm being the algebra of smooth functions on m and p( ) being the grassmann parity.
qp manifolds with a poisson bracket are called even, and those with an antibracket, odd.

let m be a qp manifold. let also zq be the zero locus of q (the submanifold where q
vanishes); this is assumed to be a smooth manifold and q is required to be regular. this means
that the components of q generates an ideal of functions vanishing on zq. one then has

proposition 2.1. [4] the binary operation { , } : fzq  fzq  fzq

(2.2)

{f, g} = (f, qg)|zq ,

f, g  fzq , f, g  fm , f |zq = f , g|zq = g .

is well dened (i.e., is independent of the choice of the representatives f, g of functions f, g on
zq). moreover, { , } is a poisson bracket (antibracket) on zq.

among the qp manifolds, i single out those on which the q vector eld is maximally nondegen-
erate in the following sense: the matrix ( 
a qb)|pzq of the linear operators qp : tpm  tpm
labelled by p  zq should be of the maximal rank at each point p  zq. since qp is nilpotent, this
condition is formalized as follows

denition 2.2. a qp manifold m is called proper if the homology of the linear operator qp :
tpm  tpm is trivial at each point p  zq.

in coordinate-free terms, one can dene this linear operator qp as follows. for p  zq, one
considers the tangent space tpm as the quotient of vectm modulo vector elds from vectm that
vanish at p. it is easy to see that the operation

(2.3)

qp(x|p) = ([q, x])|p ,

is well-dened provided q vanishes at p. this gives an important property of the q eld on a
proper qp manifold:

proposition 2.2. let m be a proper qp manifold. then each function f satisfying qf = 0 can
be represented as f = qh + const in an appropriately small neighborhood of any point p  zq.

in dierent words, the cohomology of q is trivial when evaluated in an appropriately small

neighborhood of any point p  zq. if in particular q = (s,  ), it follows that

(2.4)

s = (, s)

zero locus reduction

4

for some (locally dened) function  (since s is dened up to a constant, the constant term is
omitted here).

another important property of proper qp manifolds is the following

proposition 2.3. [3, 4] let m be a proper qp manifold. then zq is (anti)symplectic. the
corresponding poisson bracket (antibracket) is given by (2.2).

remark. all the properties of qp manifolds stated above do hold if the manifold is nite-
dimensional. in the innite dimensional case, however, one should apply these statements with
some care. in particular, the standard master action s of e.g., the yang-mils theory is a proper
solution of the master equation (which is precisely the condition for q = (s,  ) to be proper) but
the homology of q is not trivial when evaluated on the local2 functionals.

3. reduction of the brst differential

let us be given a topological theory described by the master action s satisfying the classical

master equation:

(3.1)

(s, s) = 0 .

gauge xing in the bv framework is described by the anticanonical transformation :

(3.2)

s = s = e(, )s,

where  is a gauge fermion. the brst transformation acting on the eld-antield space is

(3.3)

q = (s,  ).

i also need the brst transformation qgf acting on the gauge-xing surface (which is identied
with l0 via l = 1l0). in the covariant bv approach, however, there is no natural way to
determine the gauge-xed brst transformation. indeed, being dened on the whole eld-antield
space m, the brst transformation does not restrict naturally to the lagrangian submanifold l 
m. thus, in order to determine the gauge-xed brst transformation, one needs an additional
structure.

let the eld-antield space m be the odd cotangent bundle over some eld space l0 (this is
the case in various applications of the bv quantization). let also a and 
a be the coordinates on
l0 and on the bers (elds and antields). then it is possible to determine the gauge-xed brst
transformation via

(3.4)

qgf f = (s, f ))|l0 ,

h  fl0 ,

where  is the pullback associated with the canonical projection  : m  l0 (again, gauge xing
submanifold l is identied with l0 via l = 1l0).

2here, local refers to space-time locality.

zero locus reduction

5

unfortunately, this prescription violates the nilpotency of the brst transformation in general.
an important case where qgf is still nilpotent is where s is linear in the antields. i will thus
assume that s has the form

(3.5)

s = s0() + 

asa .

now the gauge-xed brst transformation can be represented as
qgf h = (q(h))|l0 = (1)p(a)sa 
a

(3.6)

,

and does not, therefore, depend on the particular choice of the gauge fermion.

let zq be the zero locus of the odd vector led q = (s,  ) (the stationary surface of the master

action). assume that there exists an anticanonical transformation  such that

 (l0) = zq, i.e.,  transforms the initial lagrangian submanifold l0 into zq;
  is such that

(3.7)

s = (s, )

for some new (in general, locally dened) function  ; here  is the pullback associated to .
this can be expressed by saying that transformation  preserves the property of s to be
q-closed.

the symplectic structure on zs is carried over to l0 by the anticanonical transformation .

the corresponding poisson bracket on l0 reads

(3.8)

{f, g} = (f, ((s), g))|l0 ,

f, g  fl0 .

let me now return to master equation (3.1) and rewrite it in terms of the transformed action

s as

((s, ), (s, )) = 0 = (s, (, (s, ))) = 0 .

the expression (, (s, )) formally coincides with the poisson bracket (3.8) of  with itself. to
make this correspondence manifest, observe that the equality (s, x) = 0 implies that (locally)
x = (s, y ) + const and, thus, x|l0 = const provided l0 is the zero locus of (s,  ). now
(, (s, ))|l0 = const implies that (, (s, ))|l0 = 0, since the function  is grassmann-odd.
thus,

(3.9)

(s, (, (s, ))) = 0 , = {|l0, |l0} = 0 ,

where { ,  } is the poisson bracket (3.8) on l0.

the crucial observation is that qgf considered as the vector eld on l0 is generated by the

bracket (3.8). indeed, eq. (3.7) implies that

qgf h = (s, h)|l0 = ((, s), h) = {|l0 , h} ,

h  fl0 ,

where { ,  } is the even poisson bracket (3.8).

zero locus reduction

thus, the bv formulation of the topological theory gives rise to all the data of the corresponding
bfv scheme, including the poison bracket and the generating function  satisfying {, } = 0.
the corresponding brst transformation {,  } coincides with qgf in the bv framework.

i have to note, however, that this coincidence is rather formal: the main dierence between the
bv and bfv pictures is that in the bv framework, one works with the conguration space (the
space of eld histories), while in the bfv approach one considers the phase space. further, the
bv antibracket is dened on the functionals on space-time, and the bfv poisson bracket is the
equal-time bracket dened on the functionals on the space. in sec. 6, i will give some arguments
that make this coincidence exact in several special cases.

4. existence of 

the issue of the existence of a globally dened transformation  is very complicated in the
general setting. i will limit myself to a local analysis. the argument is based on abelianization. it
is well known that given a proper solution s to the master equation, one can nd new canonical
coordinates in some (appropriately chosen) neighborhood, where s becomes quadratic. specializing
asa() (since the theory is topological one can assume
this to the case where s has the form s = 
that the initial action s0 from (3.5) vanishes) in the initial coordinates, one arrives at the new
coordinates z, y, z

, y

 such that
y ,

s = z

(4.1)

(z, z

) = 
 ,

(y, y

) = 
 ,

and the submanifold l0 is determined by the equations z
new coordinates, the stationary surface zq is determined by the equations y = z

 = y

 = 0. it is easy to see that in the

 = 0.

one can see that the transformation  relating the submanifolds l0 and zq does not exist in
general; the existence of  implies that the superdimensions of l0 and zq are equal. this in turn
implies that among the variables x and y, there are equally many even and odd ones. this is
also a sucient condition for  to exist, at least locally.

indeed, let me assume that the condition is fullled. then the variables z, z, y, y split into
] of dierent parities. now the master action from (4.1) takes

] , [ci, bi] , [c

i , bi

the pairs [xi, ci] , [x
the form

i , ci

(4.2)

s = x

i ci + ci

bi .

and the transformation,  is obviously given by
i ) = x
i

(xi) = xi (x

(4.3)

(yi) = bi

, (bi

) = ci
) = yi, (bi) = y

(ci

 (ci) = ci
i , (y

i ) = bi .

this transformation evidently satises all the conditions of sec. 3.

an important case occurs if the master action is constructed via the standard bv prescription
for a pure gauge model. then the required condition always holds provided the conguration space
is enlarged by the nonminimal sector (i.e., by the standard auxiliary variables needed for gauge
xing). as we will see in the example in the next section, this is indeed the case with an irreducible

zero locus reduction

7

pure gauge theory. thus the nonminimal variables are precisely those which allow one to construct
the  transformation.

5. a simple example

here, i illustrate the constructions of sec. 3 in a very simple example of a topological model
which is constructed in the bv framework as follows. let me start with a smooth manifold x
considered as the conguration space of a model with the vanishing action. that the initial action
vanishes implies that all the degrees of freedom are pure gauge ones. let r be the corresponding
gauge generators, which i assume for simplicity to be linearly independent and form a closed algebra

(5.1)

[r, r] = c 

r


in local coordinates xi on x , one has r = ri
xi . that all degrees of freedom are gauge ones

implies that r considered as vector elds on x constitute a basis of the tangent space to x at
each point; equivalently, ri

 is a nondegenerate matrix.

according to the standard bv quantization prescription, i now introduce the ghost variables
c for each gauge generator r and the antields variables x
. these variables constitute the
so-called minimal sector of the gauge theory. the corresponding solution to the classical master
equation is

i , c

(5.2)

smin = x

i ri

c +

1
2

 c 
c

cc .

to x the gauge, one should enlarge the minimal set of variables to the nonminimal one. the
nonminimal variables are the antighosts c, the auxiliary led b, and their conjugate antields.
one should add also the nonminimal terms to the master action. the master action becomes

(5.3)

s = smin + c

 b .

which again is a proper solution to the master equation. now the gauge xing can be performed
by choosing a gauge fermion .

let me now concentrate on the zero locus zq of the master action (5.3). the submanifold zq
 = b = 0 and is a lagrangian submanifold of the

is determined by the equations x
conguration space. the poisson bracket (2.2) on zq reads

i = c = c

(5.4)

{xi, c

} = ri

 ,

{c

, c

} = c 

c
 ,

with all the other brackets vanishing. thus zq is equipped with a nondegenerate poisson bracket.
at the same time, the submanifold l0  m is equipped with the odd nilpotent vector eld qgf (a
gauge xed brst transformation (3.6)); in the local coordinates x, , c, c, it reads

(5.5)

qgf = cri



xi 

1

cc 
c

c

.

let me now turn to the construction of the anticanonical transformation  relating the la-
grangian submanifolds zq and l0. for the abelian theory (i.e., with the structure constants c k
ij
vanishing), the required transformation is simply an obvious modication of transformation (4.3).

zero locus reduction

in the nonabelian case, however, one should add additional terms. consider the following general-
ization of (4.3)

(xi) = xi (x
  c 

(b) = c

i ) = x
c b

(c) = c , (c

(5.6)

we have

proposition 5.1. transformation (5.6) is anticanonical (preserves the antibracket), is globally
dened, and satises the condition

(5.7)

s = (, s) .

indeed, transformation (5.6) is globally dened by construction (since it preserves the base x ).

the transformed master action is

(5.8)

s = x

it is easy to see by direct computations that

(5.9)

solves the condition (5.7).

it now follows from the general treatment of section 3 that l0 is equipped with poisson

bracket (3.8). in the local coordinates on l0, we have
{xi, b} = ri
{c, b} = c 

{c, c} =

(5.10)

c ,

{b, b} = c 
{c, b} = c

the jacobi identity for bracket (5.10) holds provided s satises the classical master equation.

it also follows from the results of sec. 3 that qgf given by (5.5) is compatible with poisson

bracket (5.10). moreover,

(5.11)

qgf = {,  }

thus, at least at the formal level, we obtain all the objects of the bfv quantization: the
poisson bracket and the generating function (the brst charge) . to make the coincidence more
clear let me choose new coordinates

(5.12)

qi = xi ,

pi = r

i (b + c 

c c) , p  = c ,

with all the others being unchanged. these are the canonical (darboux) coordinates for the poisson
bracket (5.10)

(5.13)

{xi, pj} = i

{c, p } = 
 .

in the new coordinate system, one gets

(5.14)

zero locus reduction

which is the standard form of the brst charge for the pure gauge theory with the rst-class
constraints given by t. moreover, at the formal level,3 this is the brst charge of the same theory.
indeed, the rst class constraints t satisfy the same lie algebra as the gauge transformation r
in the bv formulation; the phase space of this system is the cotangent bundle t x enlarged by
the ghosts c and the corresponding momenta p .

a remarkable feature of the proposed reduction procedure is that it reduces the bv scheme of
the topological model in the nonminimal sector to the corresponding bfv scheme in the minimal
sector. moreover, the zero locus reduction of the brst dierential identies the nonminimal
variables in the bv quantization with the momenta associated to the minimal variables in the bfv
picture of the same theory.

6. a generalization

until this point, i discussed a nite dimensional analogue of the topological theory in the
bv and bfv framework. i would now like to give some arguments showing that the zero locus
reduction works well not only at the formal level. for simplicity, i consider only the 1-dimensional
eld theory, or quantum mechanics. to avoid considerable technical complications, let me also
assume that the topological theory at hand can be represented in the form where the master action
and the gauge generators come from the corresponding objects in the target space. this means
that

(6.1)

s = z dt s((t), (t)) ,

ri

(t, t) = (t  t)ri

((t)) ,

where s and r are functions and vector elds on the target space (which is also antisymplectic).
this is the case for a wide class of pure gauge theories including e.g., sqm, chernsimons model,
and topological sigma models (see [3] for details).

then the bv congurations space is the space of smooth maps from the time line into the
target space. the conguration space is equipped with the antisymplectic structure given by the
lift of the antisymplectic structure in the target space to the space of maps into the target space
(see [3]).

since the zero locus reduction can be performed in the target space, one arrives at the symplectic
submanifold l0 equipped with the odd vector eld qgf = {,  }. the space of maps from the time
line into the symplectic manifold can be identied with the space of hamiltonian trajectories.
under this identication, the poisson bracket in the target space becomes the equal-time poisson
bracket. one thus arrives at the bfv formulation of the same topological model.

3an account is not yet taken of an explicit time dependence of the hamiltonian scheme. this issue will be explained

in sec. 6

zero locus reduction

10

7. the bv quantization from the bfv approach.

similar considerations can be applied starting with the bfv formulation of a topological model.
in that case, the zero locus of the bfv brst dierential q = {,  } is equipped with a nonde-
generate antibracket. a similar reduction procedure (where one should nd the transformation
relating the zero locus of q and the submanifold of coordinates) provides this submanifold with an
odd hamiltonian vector eld q, which can be interpreted as the brst transformation generated
by some (grassmann-even) function s viewed as the master action in the corresponding bv for-
mulation. again, the bfv formulation in the nonminimal sector reduces to the bv formulation in
the minimal sector.

8. conclusions

we have explicitly constructed the bfv phase space of a pure gauge (topological) model starting
with the bv conguration space of the bv formulation of the same model. the construction is
based on two important ingredients.

the rst one is the even poisson structure on the zero locus of the brst dierential (stationary

surface of the master action) in the bv formalism [3, 4].

the second is the construction of the appropriate anticanonical transformation  relating the
gauge xing surface (which in our simplied approach is identied with the initial submanifold
l0 via the gauge xing transformation) and the stationary surface zq of the master action. the
transformation  allows us to identify zq with l0 and, thus, to carry over the gauge xed brst
transformation qgf dened on l0 to a hamiltonian vector eld on zq (equivalently, to carry over
the poisson bracket from zq to l0; this is the viewpoint adopted in the paper). in this way, one
arrives at the lagrangian submanifold equipped with two compatible structures, the even poisson
bracket and the odd nilpotent vector led. a further analysis shows that one can formally identify
this lagrangian submanifold with the phase space of the corresponding bfv phase space.

an important feature of the proposed construction is that the bv variables of the nonminimal
sector play the role of momenta that are conjugate to the variables of the bfv minimal sector.
this gives an interesting geometrical interpretation of the nonminimal variables.

it should be noted that the relation discussed here is essentially based on the fact that the
initial bv structures correspond to the topological theory. however, in the general gauge theory
setting, one can formally separate the physical sector and the pure gauge sector and then perform
the reduction in the pure gauge sector. this suggests an interpretation of the results presented
here as those describing the structure of the pure gauge sector of the general gauge theory.

this also suggests that the poisson bracket in the bfv formulation of the general gauge theory
splits into two parts: the standard poisson bracket in the physical sector and the poisson bracket
in the pure gauge sector. the latter is related to the bv antibracket from the corresponding bv
formulation via the present construction. at least for an irreducible theory with a closed gauge

zero locus reduction

11

algebra, this relation originates in the fact that both the bv antibracket in the pure gauge sector
and the bfv poisson bracket in the pure gauge sector come from a single gerstenhaber-like bracket
structure in the gauge algebra complex (see [7] for the details). this is somewhat reminiscent of the
results of [10], where the general relationship was established between certain lie algebras w.r.t.
the bv antibracket and their hamiltonian counterparts w.r.t. the bfv poisson bracket.
