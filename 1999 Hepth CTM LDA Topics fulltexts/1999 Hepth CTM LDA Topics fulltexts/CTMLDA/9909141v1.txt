we look back at early eorts to approximate the large nc feynman diagrams of qcd as very
large shnet diagrams. we consider more carefully the uniqueness of rules for discretizing
p + and ix+ which x the shnet model in the strong t hooft coupling limit, and we oer
some renements that allow more of the crucial qcd interactions to be retained in the shnet
approximation. this new discretization has a better chance to lead to a physically sensible
bare qcd string model. not surprisingly the resulting shnet diagrams are both richer in
structure and harder to evaluate than those considered in older work. as warm-ups we analyze
arbitrarily large shnets of a paradigm scalar cubic theory and very small shnets of qcd.

introduction

with all the recent eort devoted to the search for a solution of large nc qcd [1] as a classical
string theory [2], it is appropriate to reassess earlier eorts to accomplish this goal. in this article
we wish to rene and extend the formulation and calculational methods developed in the eort of
the late seventies to systematize a shnet [3] approximation to large nc qcd [4, 5].

the larger goal here is to set up a discrete model of innite nc qcd which, when analyzed in a
weak coupling expansion (ncg2  1), reproduces perturbative qcd and, when analyzed in a strong
coupling limit (ncg2  ), describes what we choose to call a bare qcd string. since qcd is
supposed to conne at all values of the t hooft coupling, the innite nc glueball should actually
be noninteracting over the whole range of couplings. however, its composite internal structure is
generally expected to be quite complicated, and it is only in the strong t hooft coupling limit that
the internal structure of an innite nc glueball can be as simple as that of the fundamental string
of string theory. we regard it an open question whether the bare qcd string can be identied
with one of the known fundamental strings or is an entirely novel object. we hope that our eorts
will eventually settle this issue. we tentatively identify the bare qcd string with the object whose
propagation is described by the so-called shnet diagrams.

as shown in [4] the shnet diagrams by no means exhaust the planar diagrams of t hoofts
nc   limit. fishnets are certainly planar, but they are also very large in both directions:
there are many lines and many interaction vertices. it is natural to try to associate such diagrams
with strong t hooft coupling ncg2  , but as with all strong coupling expansions one must
rst dene a cuto theory which controls the size of the kinetic energy of the system. in [4] the
choice was to evaluate all graphs on a light front and simultaneously discretize p + = (p 0 + p 3)/2
and x+ = (x0 + x3)/2. in this model the large t hooft coupling limit singled out large shnet
diagrams whose continuum limit was a seamless world sheet. as usual with strong coupling limits
this conclusion is highly sensitive to the cuto model.

what one hopes when resorting to strong coupling methods is that although the limit strongly
distorts the quantitative details of the continuum theory, the qualitative physics is shared between
the continuum and lattice models for all couplings. in standard lattice gauge theories this hope is
usually expressed as requiring that the lattice model exhibit no phase transition as the coupling
constant is varied from strong to weak coupling. probably the most familiar case in which there is
a phase transition is compact qed whose strong coupling limit shows connement, but whose
continuum limit is a theory of free photons.

although the existence of a phase transition at nite coupling is usually extremely dicult
to detect, it is the case that in some situations our lattice shnets can be seen to be completely
irrelevant to the physics of large but nite coupling. in [4] this possibility was noted in the context
of scalar 4 theory. the qualitative physics of the seamless shnet diagrams is that the quanta of
the eld theory are bound into a linear polymeric chain. however, one can examine at next order
in the strong coupling expansion the nature of the interaction that should be responsible for this
binding. for  > 0 this interaction is repulsive, and the seamless world sheet given by the strong
coupling limit is a purely formal artifact. in contrast, for  < 0 the interaction is attractive, and it
is qualitatively correct to imagine that the nearest neighbor quanta form very tight bonds in the
strong coupling limit.

a serious shortcoming of the qcd shnet model attempted in [5] is that the basic gluon-gluon
quartic interaction retained in the strong coupling limit favored the alignment of the gluon spins.
this defect was not apparent, however, because the leading shnet structure was explicitly an even
function of this interaction and in fact described an anti-ferromagnetic spin arrangement. the

1

inherent instability of the system would only be seen at non-leading order. we aim to improve this
situation in the present work by proposing a discretized model whose shnet approximation retains
both the contact interactions, with their ferromagnetic tendency, and the one gluon exchange
interactions with their anti-ferromagnetic tendency.

the rest of the article is organized as follows. in section 2 we give a self contained review of the
feynman rules in light-cone gauge as well as the discretization rules largely following [4, 5]. however,
we treat the longitudinal modes dierently. we represent the induced quartic interaction of light-
cone gauge by the exchange of a short-lived ctitious spin 0 quantum: its propagation is limited to
a small number of discrete time steps. this idea motivated another departure from [5]. namely, we
also choose to represent the basic quartic gluon interaction by the exchange of another short-lived
ctitious spin 0 quantum. in this way all vertices of the discretized feynman rules are cubic, and
are accordingly all treated on the same footing in the strong coupling limit. in section 3 we show
our discretization in action by computing the gluon self energy at one loop order. we see how
the ambiguities inherent in spreading out the quartic vertices begin to be resolved by requiring
lorentz invariance. the propagators of the ctitious scalars are multiplied by fk, hk, where k is

the number of time steps, andpk fk =pk hk = 1. lorentz invariance of the self-energy constrains
the moments pk fk/k and pk hk/k. in section 4 we describe the shnet approximation. as a

warm-up, we give a complete analysis of the leading shnet diagrams of a paradigm matrix scalar
eld theory gtr3. then we describe the more complicated situation of qcd. we do not attempt to
analyze the arbitrary qcd shnets here. instead in section 5 we study the sum of planar diagrams
for small values of m , the number of units of p + carried by the evolved system. finally in section
6 we collect some concluding remarks and sketch future directions for this program of research.

2 light-cone feynman rules and discretization

d(p) = i

the signature of our metric tensor  is taken to be (, +, +, +). in this paper we shall make
extensive use of the x+ representation

d(p, p+, x+) z dp

d(p)eix+p.

(2.2)

evaluating the p integral leads to the following expressions for the individual components of d :

where the arrows indicate the imaginary time versions ( = ix+). in this paper latin indices will
always refer to the transverse components. we shall also nd it convenient to use a complex basis

for transverse indices, dening v   (v 1 + iv 2)/2 and v   (v 1  iv 2)/2. in this basis the
here we are assuming that a = a+ has not been eliminated from the formalism. since gauss
law relates a+ to the transverse components through a constraint not involving time derivatives, it
is possible to explicitly integrate a+ out (see for example [6]) leaving the transverse components as
the only independent variables. in that case the feynman rules would only employ the transverse
propagator dkl. graphically, one achieves the same result by showing that the contributions of
dk and d lead to modied cubic vertices and a new induced quartic vertex which arises from
the (x+) term in d.

we shall present the primitive cubic and quartic vertices as t hooft did in his presentation of
the 1/nc expansion [1]. since the vertex assignments lack permutation symmetry, it is understood
that all permutations of them must be included. the double line notation makes clear what powers
of nc must be included with each topology. however, since we shall be dealing exclusively with the
planar diagrams of the nc   limit, we shall dispense with this renement in order to reduce
clutter. to correctly use these rules at nite nc, the double line notation should be restored. with
this understanding, the primitive cubic vertices are given by

where the arrows indicate the appropriate vertices to use with imaginary time. in light-cone gauge,
only transverse gluons participate in the quartic vertices. our convention will be that all momenta
ow into the vertex. also, the index  () will be represented graphically by attaching an outgoing
(incoming) arrow to a line (see fig. 1). the ordering of indices will be counterclockwise around the
vertex. as usual, each vertex is associated with an integration over x+ and conserves the transverse
and + components of momentum. then each unconstrained momentum is integrated with measure
d2pdp+/(2)3.

2.3 discretization

to give a nonperturbative model for the summation over planar diagrams, it was proposed in ref.
[4] to simultaneously discretize p+ = lm and imaginary time   ix+ = ka, with k, l running over
all positive integers. the use of imaginary time converts all oscillating exponentials to damped
ones, and removes all is from the feynman rules. thus the i occurring in each vertex is combined
with the dx+ to form d . (because of time translational invariance, the time integral for one vertex
in each connected diagram should be omitted, leaving one factor of i unabsorbed. conventionally,
we shall omit this last i in the quantities we calculate.)

it can be easily seen that the lattice constants a, m only enter the sum of graphs in the ratio
t0  m/a. first notice that only this ratio appears in the exponents. since each propagator is
nominally integrated over its p+, r dp+  mp provides a factor of m to cancel one from a 1/p+
prefactor in each propagator. further r d  ap at each vertex which also has a nominal p+
conserving delta function that supplies a 1/m, so each vertex supplies a factor 1/t0. finally, every
 index of a propagator will be matched with a + index of a vertex, which will involve a factor
of p+ and hence supply a factor of m to cancel the extra factor of 1/m in dk and to convert the
extra factor of 1/ma in d to t0.

the discretization of d involves some ambiguity in the interpretation of the term involving
(x+). with x+ continuous, this term collapses the two cubic vertices it connects into an instan-
taneous quartic interaction local in x but p+ dependent and hence nonlocal in x. indeed this is
precisely the well-known quartic vertex induced by elimination of a+ in the hamiltonian formu-
lation of light-cone gauge. in this approach the remaining part of d combines nicely with the
contributions of dk to yield a modied cubic vertex for transverse gluons only:

2  q+

2 q
1 )

1 q

2  q+

2 q
1 ),

(2.6)

which are the vertices appropriate to imaginary time. with longitudinal gauge elds completely
eliminated in this way, discretization could then proceed as usual by discretizing the x+ and p+
parameters of the transverse gluon propagator. in addition, one has to exclude, in some ad hoc
manner, the p+ = 0 exchange part of the induced quartic vertex which is innite as it stands.
moreover, the set of tadpole diagrams necessarily excluded in our discretization (see sec. 2.4
below) is enlarged by the induced quartic interaction and, since the new quartic interactions depend
non-trivially on p+, the p+ dependence of the necessary counter-terms will be more complicated.
nevertheless, an attractive feature of such a treatment is that the modied cubic vertex is manifestly
invariant under the light-cone galilei group: q  q + q+v.
we shall follow a dierent path, more in the spirit of the sum over histories. the idea is to
exploit our discretization of x+ to give a more exible interpretation of (x+), which retains a

4

gaussian damping factor and maintains galilei invariance throughout. this can be done by the
replacement:

d(q, q+ = m m, x+ = ika) 

q2
2m 3 ekq2/2m t0  fk

t0
m 2 ekq2/2m t0

fk = 1.

xk>0

(2.7)

the last term on the r.h.s. of eq (2.7) is a satisfactory discretization of the delta function provided
the fks fall o suciently rapidly with k. the exclusion of f0 ensures damping of transverse
momentum integrals. in this approach, instead of a new induced quartic vertex we have introduced
a short lived scalar, whose exchange simulates that vertex in a way that maintains galilei invariance.
further, by leaving the choice of the fks open we might be able to tune their values to cancel
unwanted symmetry violations induced by ultraviolet divergences in the continuum limit. the rst
term on the r.h.s. of eq (2.7) is exactly what is needed to complete the modied cubic vertex (2.6)
when combining all of the contributions of the longitudinal gluons.

perhaps a more intuitive discretization would be to replace the derivative in d by a discrete

dierence:

d(q, m m,ika)  

t0

m 2 (cid:26) ekq2/2m t0  e(k1)q2/2m t0

eq2/2m t0

k > 1
k = 1

,

(2.8)

where the special treatment of the case k = 1 simulates the (x+) contribution we know must
be there in the continuum. unfortunately, this denition violates galilei invariance because of the
term that propagates only k1 steps in time: newtonian mass conservation is temporarily violated.
this causes considerable complications in calculations, but nonetheless displays interesting features.
we wont pursue this option in the main text, but in an appendix we shall see that with a suitable
counter-term galilei invariance of the one loop self energy can be restored in the continuum limit.

2.4 tadpoles

the exclusion of the propagators with zero  and zero p+ renders every feynman integral nite,
making our discretization an eective regulator of divergences.4 but it also means that certain
tadpole feynman diagrams, which involve one or more propagators originating and terminating
at the same vertex are excluded. in a theory with at most quartic vertices, these diagrams are
limited to self-energy parts, which generally require counter-terms to enforce lorentz invariance in
the continuum limit. thus errors induced by excluding these diagrams could simply be absorbed
in the ultimate value of the counter-terms.

tadpoles arising from the cubic interaction (see fig. 2(a)) represent the vacuum expectation
value of the color current density. the transverse components of these would vanish anyway because
they are linear in transverse momentum but we can make sure all these tadpoles vanish by simply
normal ordering the current density. however tadpoles arising from the quartic interaction, see
fig.2(b), would give a divergent non-vanishing result if the zero time propagator were inserted. as
mentioned above one possibility is to absorb them in the self-energy counter-term.

another possibility is to note that, from the point of view of the continuum, one can just
as well spread the quartic interaction over several time steps, in which case a candidate for the

4the discrete light-cone quantization (dlcq) industry which burgeoned in the mid eighties (for a review see [7])
only exploited p + discretization leaving ultraviolet divergences unregulated. discretization of ix+ has the eect of
introducing factors of eap

(which is a popular way to regulate uv divergences) into loop integrals.

figure 3: quartic vertices get replaced by two cubic vertices and a ctitious scalar eld.

tadpole diagrams would emerge. we have already exploited this idea in our discretization of d,
see eq (2.7). a natural way to do this is to imagine that the quartic interaction is actually the
concatenation of two cubic interactions mediated by a ctitious scalar eld which is only allowed
to propagate a few time steps5. we thus redraw the various quartic vertices as in fig. 3. the
ctitious scalars must be ghosts: to reproduce the quartic couplings, either their coupling to two
transverse gluons must be taken imaginary or their propagator must be negative. we choose the
second alternative for which the vertices are given in fig. 4. note that the quartic vertex which

the subscript m indicates that this is a magnetic ghost vertex. this replaces the two quartic
vertices at the bottom of fig. 1.

involves adjacent like direction spins in one channel can be viewed as a spin zero exchange in only
one way, whereas the vertex with unlike adjacent spins in both channels becomes two exchange
diagrams, giving a natural interpretation of the factor of 2 in the eective quartic vertex. if we now
consider the tadpoles arising from connecting any pair of external lines, we see that there are

5note that in higher dimensions, the ctitious eld would be a transverse two-form instead of a scalar. such an
additional degree of freedom is presaged by the rst order formulation of gauge theory in which f is treated as
independent of a and the lagrangian density is trf 2/4 + itrf (a  igaa). going to light-cone gauge in
this formalism leaves, in addition to ak, the (nondynamical) elds f+ and fkl. our prescription simply gives these
extra elds a short-lived dynamics.

3 diagrams, see fig. 5, but the two with the topology of a cubic tadpole, which cannot be drawn
in our discretized light-cone formalism, cancel. thus the only remaining tadpole is the bubble
diagram on the far right of fig. 5, which poses no problem for our formalism.

figure 5: three tadpole diagrams resulting from the spreading out of the quartic gauge vertex.

the ctitious scalar propagator can be taken to be

d(q, m, k) = hkt0ekq2/2m t0

hk = 1,

xk>0

(2.9)

where the hks, like the fks, vanish rapidly with k. the normalization condition guarantees that
the correct quartic vertex will be reproduced in the continuum limit. the exponential factor damps
ultraviolet divergences, and with the form we have specied, maintains galilei invariance even for
nite lattice constants. furthermore, by leaving the choice of the hks open, we gain additional
exibility to cancel unwanted symmetry violations. the hope is that tuning the fks and hks will
remove the need for explicit counter-terms.

3 gluon self-energy and counter-terms at one loop

in this section we illustrate the way discretization regulates divergences by computing the one-loop
contribution to the gluon self-energy part, i , dened as the sum of all one particle irreducible
diagrams for the two-point function. for this purpose it is convenient to pass from x+ representation
to energy (e = p) representation. with discretized  , this is accomplished by dening

d(q, m, e) =

 (q, m, e) =

eaked(q, m, k)

eake (q, m, k).

the evaluation of j+ is not much harder. here there are four diagrams that dier only in
the prefactor of transverse momentum (see fig. 7). since the prefactor is linear in momentum, we
need only to remember that the gaussian integral over transverse momentum involves the shift
p  p + lq/m . after this shift the term linear in p integrates to zero, so the net eect is to set
p = lq/m . thus the net prefactor is

qj
m

(2l  m )[(1 + l/m ) + (2 + l/m ) + +(1  l/m ) + +(2  l/m ) =

2qj
m 2 (2l  m )2, (3.9)

which involves the identical sum over l as ++. thus we end up with

j+ =

qj
m

(m  1)(m  2)( ln(1  u)).

(3.10)

figure 8: the eight bubble diagrams that contribute to .

the coecient of qiqj in ij may be singled out by computing . this leads to a similar
calculation to the above because, after the shift in integration variable, p and pp both integrate
to zero. thus again, prefactors of p may simply be set to lq/m . eight diagrams contribute to
this quantity, equal in pairs (see fig. 8). the prefactors of these diagrams combine as follows:

2qq

m 2

((m + l)2 + (2m  l)2  (m + l)(2m  l)  (m + l)(2m  l)) =

2qq

m 2

(2l  m )2.(3.11)

so again we have the same sum over l, leading to:

 =

g2nc

qq
m 2 (m  1)(m  2)( ln(1  u)).

the equality of the various s holds even at nite m, a. this can be understood because the
diagrams we have evaluated show no violation of galilei invariance. our result for 1 can be
compared with the result from the study of asymptotic freedom in the innite momentum frame

continuum limit, a  0, m  , 1  u  (q2  2q+e)/2m t0 = q2/2m t0. thus for us, the
role of 2 is played by the quantity 2m t0 = 2q+/a. note that if we choose to keep t0 xed, the
ultraviolet cuto is removed by simply taking m  .

3.2 calculation of 2

finally we turn to the real core of the self energy calculation, the determination of 2, which can
be inferred from  = qq1 + 2 = 2 + q21/2. seventeen diagrams contribute to this
quantity, fteen of which do not involve d and are relatively simple to analyze. first consider

figure 9: the three bubble diagrams that contribute to 

a involving only transverse components.

the three diagrams that only involve transverse internal propagators (see fig. 9). the prefactors
of transverse momentum combine as follows:

(2p  q)(2p  q) + (p + q)(p + q) + (2q  p)(2q  p) = 3(p2 + q2  p  q)

 3(p2 + (1  l/m + (l/m )2)q2),

(3.15)

where in the last line we have indicated the result of shifting p by lq/m and dropping the term
linear in p. the transverse integral of the term in q2 is the same as before, but the term in p2
gives an extra factor 2t0l(m  l)/km . these terms require the sums

the rst term inside the large square brackets is exactly the contribution one would obtain using
the modied cubic vertex (2.6) in the three diagrams of fig. 9. the terms with fk represent the
tadpole diagram that would have been constructed from the induced quartic vertex had a+ been
eliminated from the formalism. this is as it should be because summing over all the diagrams
involving dk and d is the graphical equivalent of the elimination of the a+ degree of freedom.
the formalism with a+ eliminated gives an extremely ecient calculation of the three bubble
diagrams, as shown in the next subsection, but no candidate for the tadpoles. but by treating a+
graphically we are led to a useful proposal for the tadpole diagram.

in order to compare our results to the continuum calculation of ref. [8], we must examine the
limits u  1 and m  . the behavior of the rst term of eq. (3.30) in this limit is transparent
once we use the identity

and a similar expansion forpk fkuk/k. the coecient of the linear term is completely determined
by the normalization conditions on the f s and hs. momentum independent terms in 2 imply a
(divergent and noncovariant) tachyonic gluon mass squared in perturbation theory. since the gluon
has only helicity 1, such a mass is inconsistent with poincare invariance of the continuum limit.
clearly these symmetry violating terms would be cancelled if we could impose the constraints

but clearly the second of these is impossible with hk independent of m (implicitly assumed in
(2.9)). the best we can do is to set the r.h.s. of eq. (3.34) to 2/18, which would cancel the
linear divergence of 2. however, there remains a nite gluon mass which is still inconsistent with
the poincare invariance of the continuum theory. one option would be to cancel this with a mass
counter-term, whose coecient would have to be determined order by order.

another approach is to allow hk to be dependent on m . we have the freedom to make this
replacement as long as we recover the correct continuum limit (m   and a  0) of the theory6.

we prefer this approach to that of a mass counter-term, since it is possible that this is a uniform
description that works order by order (at each order the cancellation places constraints on higher
moments of h). the hope is that this can be used non-perturbatively.

for the coecient of q2 ln q2, provided we identify m e with q+/ and 2m t0 with 2. we do not
get, nor should we expect, the same (nite) coecient of q2.

6we have the same exibility for the f s in (2.7) but as we will see this is not necessary at least at one loop order.

3.3 a brief calculation of 

in the work just completed, we deliberately kept the a+ degree of freedom in the graphical rules
in order to keep the calculation as close as possible to one in other gauges. however, having seen
how all of the graphs with longitudinal gluons combine so nicely, it is appropriate to note that the
calculation with a+ explicitly eliminated, so that the feynman rules refer only to the transverse
gluons, is much more compact and ecient. with our prescription we can exploit this simplication
by using the modied cubic vertices eq. (2.6) for the transverse gluons. at the same time we retain
our replacement of both the bare and induced quartic vertices by the exchange of two short-lived
scalars. the self-energy diagrams involving those scalars will be exactly as described previously (i.e.
the terms involving f s and hs). however, all of the remaining contributions to kl are reduced to
the two or three diagrams involving only transverse gluons and the modied cubic vertices.

only two diagrams contribute to , the last two diagrams in fig. 8, and they each involve a

prefactor

(m p  lq)(m p  lq)  m 2pp,

(3.41)

after the shift in momentum. clearly this integrates to zero so  = 0. finally there are only
three non-tadpole graphs to consider for , namely those in fig. 9. in this case the relevant
prefactors from the three diagrams contributing to  combine as

after the usual shift in momentum. note that because these vertices are manifestly galilei invariant,
there is no term proportional to q2 in the prefactor. thus after integration over loop momentum
we are left with the contribution to :

4 summing planar diagrams: fishnets

the discretized feynman rules given at the end of sec. 3 provide a tool to sum classes of diagrams.
as described in [4] summing diagrams on a light front has a direct interpretation as the path
history quantum evolution of a system of particles moving in the transverse space under newtonian
dynamics. by xing the total discretized p + = m m, the maximum number of particles present
at any time is m . because the vertices allow particles to fuse and ssion, particle number is not
conserved and there is quantum mechanical mixing between states with any number of particles
between 1 and m .

we are particularly interested in the class of planar diagrams singled out by t hoofts nc  
limit of qcd. it is actually more precise to think of this class of diagrams as drawn on a cylinder
rather than a plane: at any time the system of particles is ordered around a ring, and interactions
only exist between neighbors on this ring. thus the stage is set for the particles to bind into a
closed polymer chain. this was previously investigated in [4] where scalar matrix eld theory with
quartic couplings, tr4/4 was considered. these interactions are attractive (repulsive) if  < 0
( > 0). thus bound chains can form only if  < 0, the unstable sign. in the interpretation of
the sum of diagrams as a sum over histories of a system of particles, this sign assures that all
histories contribute with a positive weight. using the discretization of p + and ix+, as reviewed
here in sec. 2, a strong t hooft coupling limit nc   was formulated and analyzed. this
was achieved by focusing attention on the cylinder diagrams that evolve a system of particles with
p + = m m a xed large number n steps forward in time. the limit singles out those diagrams in
which every particle has the minimum p + = m (so the number of particles is maximal = m ), and
each propagator evolves only one time step. for even m these diagrams include the large shnet

16

diagrams that form a seamless web of quartic vertices and propagators, and the resulting gaussian
integrals could be identied as a discretized path integral for a relativistic bosonic string quantized
on the light-cone.

this work on scalar eld theory was immediately followed by a rst attempt to apply these
in that work qcd was formulated on a light front, with p + and
ideas to large nc qcd [5].
ix+ discretized. the ordinary bare vertices of qcd, both cubic and quartic, were used. because
the quartic coupling in qcd is of order g2, the literal strong coupling limit, as formulated in [4],
favored shnet diagrams with only the primitive (i.e. non-induced) quartic couplings. actually
this conclusion required the ad hoc exclusion of the p + = 0 exchange part of the induced quartic
interactions arising from xing the light-cone gauge. nonetheless, the resulting shnet was very
interesting: the spin of the gluons played the role of the arrows of a certain six vertex model, known
as the f-model [9]. in fact the four gluon vertices of the eld theory were exactly the vertices of
the f-model. the fact that some of the vertex weights were negative did not cause problems for
the leading strong coupling shnets because those diagrams always had an even number of negative
weight vertices. however the problem with them reappears at next order because the deletion of a
single negative vertex reveals a repulsive nearest neighbor interaction in that spin channel7. thus
that channel could not have formed a bond in the rst place. in some spin channels there were
also positive weights, so that the bonds could form. however, unfortunately for these shnets,
the attractive channels are ferromagnetic: the only long polymers that could be formed by these
interactions would have enormous spin!

the problem is that at strong coupling only the quartic interactions survived with the dis-
cretization of [5]. the spin-spin interaction from gluon exchange has anti-ferromagnetic behavior,
and it is possible that a discretization that allowed the exchange interaction to compete with the
quartic interaction could cure this problem. to explore this possibility, one of us examined the
relative strengths of quartic and cubic exchange interactions for neighbors on a gluonic chain by
putting the two gluons in a spherical mit bag [10]. in that context one can see explicitly, not only
that the cubic exchange of a transverse gluon is anti-ferromagnetic, but that its strength (at least in
weak coupling perturbation theory) is more than sucient to reverse the ferromagnetic character of
the quartic interaction. a major shortcoming of the discretization of [5] is that at strong coupling
the cubic interactions have no opportunity to compete with the quartic interactions.

the discretization developed in sec. 2 of this paper is more promising. in fact, we do away
with quartic interactions completely: all interactions are cubic! the quartic interactions have
been replaced by the exchange of ctitious scalars, and these exchanges are not enhanced by strong
coupling over the exchanges of the ordinary transverse gluons. without quartic vertices the basic
cells of the densest diagrams are no longer square but hexagonal: the shnet looks like a honeycomb
(see fig. 15). these shnet diagrams require particles with both 1 and 2 units of p +. thus the
leading shnet structure is somewhat looser than in the quartic coupling case. the inclusion of
two dierent values of p + in the leading approximation also sets the stage for the emergence of
a string degree of freedom (provided string states do form!) corresponding to uctuations in p +.
such a degree of freedom is expected to be described at long worldsheet wavelength by polyakovs
liouville eld [11].

because all of our vertices are cubic, the paradigm scalar eld theory is now gtr3/3. of
course, the presence of factors of transverse momentum in the qcd cubic vertices will cause a
profound qualitative dierence between gauge and scalar theory. for one thing, the scalar theory
is super-renormalizable with the cubic coupling carrying dimensions of mass. this means that

7 contrast this with the cubic scalar theory where the sign of the coupling is indeed irrelevant because the deletion

of a single cubic coupling is not allowed by the feynman rules.

cylindrical topology.

weak or strong coupling is determined by the size of the ratio g2nc/2, where  is a mass scale
relevant to the calculated physical quantity. for example, in our strong coupling considerations,
we can simply take 2 = t0. also, since 3 is unbounded at large  in one direction, the theory is
ultimately unstable, although this instability is not evident in weak coupling perturbation theory
if the scalar eld has a non-zero mass. but the topology of graphs and momentum ow is the same
in both scalar eld theory theory and our version of discretized qcd, so we shall exploit the scalar
paradigm to illustrate such common features. the absence of spin degrees of freedom in the scalar
theory is a helpful simplication for at least some issues.

before turning to details, we comment on the ambiguities in our setup contained in the values
of the f s and hs (see eqs (2.7) and (2.9)). as shown in our study of the gluon self-energy in
sec. 3, weak coupling perturbation theory constrains moments of these quantities (for example,

at one loop we nd constraints on p fk/k and p hk/k). since strong coupling emphasizes short

times, we expect this limit to put constraints on the fk and hk for low values of k. thus we gain
complementary or dual information about the theory as we explore both limits. it should be
stressed here that there is no unique discretized theory to associate with continuum qcd: all
sorts of lattice details get washed out in the continuum limit. instead our goal is to nd a single
lattice model that shows continuum qcd at weak coupling and string theory at strong coupling.
this dual requirement will hopefully help to determine a unique theory.

as in [4] we shall consider the sum of cylinder diagrams that evolve a system with p + = m m
forward in time by the amount t = n a. for xed initial and nal states, according to our
prescription, there are only a nite number of diagrams that contribute. this denes a denite
model that can be studied as a function of the bare couplings. if the complete sum could be done for
arbitrary m and n , one could then read o the exact spectrum of the continuum theory by studying
the limit m, n  , with parameters tuned so that the limit is nontrivial. this is presumably
too ambitious, but in the next section we shall at least be able to deal nonperturbatively with
some small values of m . one might also envision studying moderate values of m numerically on a
computer. in the rest of this section we shall discuss the shnet diagrams that describe the innite
coupling limit of our model.

let us rst consider the scalar paradigm. it is sometimes helpful to dene a transfer matrix t
which evolves one step forward in time. in order to do this, start with time continuous and express
the exact time evolution by an amount a in the interaction picture:

ea(h0+v ) = eah0



xn=0

(a)n
n!

z a

0

dt1dt2  dtnt [vi (t1) vi(tn)].

(4.1)

18

this expression is exact, and of course it does not correspond to any discretization. our dis-
cretization is given by approximating each vi (ti)  vi (0) = v and only retaining the term
t [vi (t1) vi (tn)] when each vi acts on a dierent subsystem of the particles present initially.
we shall therefore write the transfer matrix for our discretized theory as

t = eah0

(a)n
n!

[v n],



xn=0

(4.2)

where we understand [v n] = 0 unless each of the n v s acts on a dierent subsystem of the particles
present. with this understanding we implement our discretization rule that every line in a diagram
propagate at least one step in time. these approximations are strictly valid for suciently small a
at xed coupling parameters. but we use eq. 4.2 to dene a discretized shnet model at xed nite
a, which we intend to study at all values of the coupling, including g  . although the strong
coupling limit at xed a (as always) takes one far from the original continuum theory quantitatively,
we hope that it will lead to a new continuum qcd string theory bearing qualitative resemblance
to real qcd. but there is, of course, no a priori guarantee of this outcome.

an ecient way to implement the nc   limit is via the fock space approach of [12]. one

chooses a state of the form

|i =

m

x=1

1

c x{mk}z tr[a

n /2

m1

(p1) a

m

(p)]|0i(p1, m1, . . . , p, m),

(4.3)

and applies the transfer matrix keeping only terms that survive the nc   limit. the second
sum is over all partitions of m , such that m1 + m2 +  + m = m . all such terms retain the
color trace structure and describe interactions between nearest neighbors as dened by the color
trace. if we wish also to take the innite t hooft coupling described by the densest shnet, we
choose m even (m = 2n) and restrict  in the sum to the two values:  = 2n with mk = 1 for all
k and  = n with mk = 2 for all k, and we require that every particle present participate in an
interaction at each time step. this leads to the following coupled equations for n and 2n when
|i is an eigenstate of the transfer matrix:

where t is the eigenvalue of the transfer matrix, and we have included a bare mass 0 for the scalar
eld. in the continuum limit t  eae. we have suppressed the mks in the arguments of n and
2n due to their simplicity. clearly, we can eliminate 2n to obtain a single equation for n:

where in the last line we have shifted integration variables to complete the square in the gaussian
exponent. this equation sums diagrams including not only the basic shnet, but also shnet
diagrams containing any number of time intervals in which n subsystems each with m = 2 propagate
freely for arbitrary lengths of time (see fig. 16). this complication is described by the second term

figure 16: fishnet with a section of m = 2 subsystems propagating freely. the dashed lines again
indicate the closed cylindrical topology.

on the l.h.s. in considering the eect of this term, one should keep in mind that no self mass counter-
terms have been included in the derivation of (4.7). for example, in weak coupling perturbation
theory, the self energy bubble by itself would lower the scalar mass squared by an innite amount.
to keep the scalar mass non-tachyonic at weak coupling one needs a mass counter-term. with
discrete time, it is convenient (as in our treatment of tadpoles) to spread such a mass counter-term
over several time steps by introducing a short lived ctitious scalar with a quadratic coupling to
the real scalar eld of order g. we would then have additional diagrams as in fig. 17, and the

we shall begin by dropping this term completely (i.e. by choosing 1 = 1) to determine the
contribution of the basic shnet for the scalar cubic theory. later, we shall comment on the eect
of 1 < 1.

in order to understand the dynamics inherent in the basic shnet, it is helpful to express the
integral transform on the r.h.s. of (4.7) as an operator in the state space of a rst quantized system
of n particles. it is straightforward to show that the appropriate operator is given by

  nepj p2

j /2t0et0pi(xi1xi)2/4,

(4.9)

where the ps and xs are the momentum and coordinate operators for the n particle system. here
 is an operator dened in momentum and coordinate bases by

 z yj

and m is an n  n matrix dened by

(4.10)

(4.11)

it is easy to check that m is invertible provided n is odd. for n even there is a zero eigenvalue
which must be separated and handled before continuing the analysis. for simplicity, we assume n
is odd in the following discussion. one can readily verify that  has the following action on the
coordinates and momenta:

xk = xl(m 1)lk
pk = mklpl.

(4.12)

(4.13)

because of the gaussian structure of , it also has a linear action on the coordinates and

momenta:

xk = [xl + ipl/t0](m 1)lk

pk = (cid:18)mklpl  i

[xl + ipl/t0][2(m 1)lk  (m 1)l,k+1  (m 1)l,k1](cid:19) .

note that these eigenvalues are not real because  is not a hermitian operator. however, also
note that the second factor is positive for both branches and for 0 < l < n. the eigenvalue is
therefore always in the right half complex plane. we also have that |+| = 1 which implies that
|+| > 1 > ||. moreover, the rst factor which contains the complex phase can be rewritten in

which shows that the phase is proportional to the shnet momentum created by the eigenoperator:
l/n for l < n/2 and (n  l)/n for l > n/2. cyclic symmetry of the initial wavefunction implies
that the total shnet momentum must be 0.
the ground state (belonging to the largest eigenvalue ) is determined by the condition that it

this result shows that the string arising from our basic cubic shnet has an eective rest tension of
t0/2, corresponding to a regge slope parameter  = 1/2t0. noting that here the transverse
dimensionality is 2 and not 24, eq. (4.31) gives the usual result of bosonic string theory, d/6.
this is all for the basic cubic scalar shnet, in which the second term on the l.h.s. of eq. (4.7)
is tuned to zero. including that term, we nd a solution for general n intractable. however, quali-
tatively, we can say that it introduces a continuum threshold at t = n/2(1  1)n/2, corresponding
to a threshold energy eth = (n/2a) ln((1  1)). as long as the basic shnet described above
produces a ground state energy eg < eth, we can expect qualitatively similar physics for large n.
however, for eg = eth we can expect that the seamless shnet structure begins to be disrupted

figure 18: typical example of a strong coupling qcd shnet.

with a dramatic qualitative change in the physics. we shall explore this eect for small values of
m in the next section.

finally, let us turn to qcd. the rst major dierence is that each line can exist in four dierent
internal states, corresponding to the two polarizations of the transverse gluon (with spin sz = 1)
and the two ctitious scalars introduced to simulate the quartic interactions (see fig. 18 for an
example of a generic dense qcd shnet lattice). in the fock space language this can be described
by axing a 4-valued index to the creation operators. the basic shnet diagrams will be the same
as in the cubic scalar theory, but with the complication that the vertex value depends on the states
of the lines entering it. in particular, some of the vertices are linear in the transverse momenta of
the incoming lines, leading to an interesting spin-orbit coupling on the shnet world sheet. thus
the qcd shnet dynamics requires the solution of a two-dimensional lattice spin system with a
nontrivial interplay between the internal spin variables and the structure of the lattice itself.
contrast this with the shnet contemplated in [5] and based solely on the quartic coupling. in the
latter situation the spin degrees of freedom decoupled from the transverse coordinate degrees of
freedom and corresponded to the soluble f-model, one of the 6-vertex models. the shnet model
we are proposing here has a considerably richer structure, which we shall begin to explore for small
values of m in the next section.

5 baby fishnets

in section 4 we discussed how our discretized feynman rules can be used to determine the dense
qcd shnets for strong coupling. this was also discussed in the context of the paradigm cubic
scalar theory.
in this section we are interested in the dynamics of the discretized theory away
from strong coupling. potentially the strong coupling limit will not be described only by the dense
shnet lattice. while the ultimate goal is to do this for m   (remember p + = m m), we will
begin by analyzing systems with small values of m (i.e. baby shnets).
the simplest non-trivial qcd shnet has m = 2. we always understand our shnets to
propagate color singlet systems so that they have cylindrical topology. then the m = 2 shnet
has no interesting dynamics due to the fact that color-singlet gluons decouple from gluon bubbles.
however, the color adjoint m = 2 gluon propagator which plays an important role as a subsystem
of larger diagrams, can be solved to all orders in perturbation theory due its simplicity. we leave
investigation of m  3 to the future. another possible avenue of investigation is systems involving
sources rather than pure glue, (such congurations are discussed in [14]). we also defer exploration
of such systems.

24

in section 4 we were only able to solve the strong coupling cubic scalar shnet for general n with
the term on the l.h.s. of eq. (4.8) cancelled via a mass counter-term (we will dene 2 = 1  1).
but for special cases of m = 2n we can solve (4.8) including 2-term. the simplest of these is the
m = 2 scalar shnet, however, in this case the only eect of the 2-term is to rescale the solution
presented in section 4. for the more interesting cases of m = 4, 6 we will see that they too can be
solved. for m = 6 the solution is computed through the use of an s-wave approximation.

5.1 m = 2 states of qcd

the m = 2 color singlet glueball states display no dynamics, because our discretization with exclu-
sively cubic vertices only allows interactions via mixing between one gluon and two gluon states,
and there is no interacting color singlet gluon. (even if the gauge group is u (nc) the abelian gluon
completely decouples in the pure gauge theory.) to understand this decoupling in terms of our
feynman rules, note that on a cylinder the gluon self energy bubble can close in two ways as in
fig. 19. it is then easy to see from our rules that the two diagrams are equal in magnitude and
opposite in sign. the conclusion is that the m = 2 color singlet channel consists of two free m = 1
gluons or, in the u (nc) case, a single free m = 2 gluon. this trivial situation is due to the manner
in which the quartic vertices of the initial gauge theory have been replaced by scalar exchange.
only the direct channel scalar exchange is allowed at m = 2, and the part of the quartic vertex
that is described by the crossed channel exchange only makes its appearance for m  3.

(b)

figure 19: here we see how bubbles of a generic m = 2 shnet lattice can close in 2 ways due to
the cylindrical topology. the wraparound diagram (a) has the opposite sign to the bubble diagram
(b), so that they cancel.

thus the only nontrivial m = 2 channels are color non-singlets. moreover, xing m = 2 limits
the allowed diagrams so drastically that the nonvanishing ones can be explicitly summed to all
orders in perturbation theory. we rst look at the m = 2 gluon propagator, which can be simply
read o from sec 3. for simplicity we work in the center of mass frame. the diagrams that

these constraints on the f s and h(1)s have been determined in section 3 at large m (see (3.33)
and (3.39)) in order to cancel divergences in 2. we tentatively impose the same constraints at all
nite m in order to have a uniform description for all m . the exact transverse gluon propagator
for m = 2 is (see (3.6))

this propagator evolves a spin 1 color adjoint system, which by itself would not correspond to a
glueball, which must be a color singlet. because of its importance for larger diagrams, it is worth
understanding the energy eigenstates implied by the propagators pole structure. the (1  u)1
factor out front is just the massless gluon pole (u = 1 implies e = 0).

zeroes of the quantity in square brackets in eq 5.3 determine any additional eigenvalues:

even with the f s and h(1)s general, one can note that the r.h.s. tends to  as u  1, with
behavior completely xed by the constraints. also for u  0 the r.h.s. vanishes quadratically as
(9  9f1  h1(1))u2/4. therefore if 9  9f1  h1(1) > 0 there would be at least two solutions
for suciently large g, the lowest of which would tend to u = 0 as g  .
if, however, the
inequality were reversed, the r.h.s. might never be positive in which case there would be no solution.
alternatively, if it did cross the axis there would be at least two solutions the lowest of which would
tend to some nonzero u = u0 > 0 as g  . it is amusing to see which of these behaviors is
suggested by a minimal solution of the constraints so far imposed (see (5.2)). for m = 2 we can
meet the constraints with only the rst two elements of each series nonzero, which are then fully
determined by the constraints:

f1 = 1 +

f2 = 2

h1(1) = 1,

h2(1) = 2.

where li2(u) is the dilogarithm (spence) function [15]. as we can see in fig. 21 this minimal
choice shows no physical eigenvalue, since there is no positive solution for 82/g2nc for any value
of u  [0, 1].
finally, the m = 2 color adjoint magnetic scalar propagator also receives self energy corrections
which can be summed exactly (see fig. 22).
(note that the ctitious electric scalar (solid line
propagator) does not play a role in the m = 2 channel, since its coupling to two m = 1 transverse

gluons is zero.) although the magnetic scalars contribution to the dynamics of a color singlet
m = 2 glueball cancels, its propagator describes a spin 0 m = 2 color adjoint subsystem in larger
shnets, and so it is also useful to analyze here. in these diagrams the bubbles correspond to the
one-loop self energy diagrams of the ctitious magnetic scalar (the dashed scalar). the magnetic
scalar self energy (see fig. 23) is given by

again we see the same possible behaviors as in the case of the gluon propagator (except, of course,
there is no massless pole at u = 1!). in this case we also present the results of choosing a minimal
set of the hk(2) to satisfy the constraints. doing this yields

bound state (actually two) with 0 < u < 1 for the coupling greater than some critical value,
g2nc/82 & 18.28. such a bound state would be signicant because it would mean that the short-
lived magnetic scalar, which we have introduced as a device, can gain longevity at strong coupling,
so that it can play the role of a spin 0 gluon in larger diagrams.

28

there is also a solution for negative u for all couplings. from the interpretation u = eae we
see that these solutions would correspond to complex energies with imaginary part i/a. in fact
the relation between u and e is fundamentally ambiguous by the imaginary amount 2in/a simply
due to the discretization of  . we presume this ambiguity is simply a lattice artifact, and it seems
likely that the solutions with negative u are also artifacts. however, the ultimate proof of their
artifactual nature must await a more complete understanding of the continuum limit, which will
involve taking m   as well as a  0.

5.2 strong coupling m = 4 scalar fishnet

clearly we need to be able to deal with large values of m if we are to understand qcd. in this
section, to better understand what this will involve, we look more closely at the m = 4 sector of
the simpler paradigm scalar theory. in particular we would like to explore the eect of the 2-term
on the l.h.s. of the strong coupling eq. (4.8). recall that we have set 1 1 = 2. we dropped this
term in the analysis of sec. 4 because it made the equation intractable for general n. however, for
the special case of m = 4 (n  m/2 = 2) it is possible to solve this equation. we also note that
this case was not covered in sec. 4 (even with the 2-term removed) because of the limitation to
odd n. the additional special case of m = 6 will be investigated in the following subsection.

for m = 4 the strong coupling eigenvalue equation reads

(cid:16)t2  22e(q2

1+q2

2(qt /2 + k2  k1, qt /2 + k1  k2)e(k2

1+k2

2)/t0 ,

(5.14)

where qt = q1 + q2. after the change of variables (kt  k1 + k2 and k  k2 k1) we can integrate
with respect to kt on the r.h.s. what remains is

(cid:16)t2  22e(q2

1+q2

2)/2t0(cid:17) 2(q1, q2) =

2)/2t0z d2k

t0

2(qt /2 + k, qt /2  k)ek2/2t0 .

(5.15)

then the equation becomes

if we now perform a variable transformation on the qs (qt  q1 + q2 and q  (q1  q2)/2)
(cid:16)t2  22e(q2

t +4q2)/4t0(cid:17) 2(qt /2 + q, qt /2  q) =

t +4q2)/4t0z d2k

t0

2(qt /2 + k, qt /2  k)ek2/2t0 .

(5.16)

we can absorb the qt dependence by scaling t = t0 exp(q2
mass frame.

t /8t0), in eect going to the center of

for the case of t2

0 > 22, we can eliminate the 2 dependence by manipulating this equation

and integrating with respect to d2q. the result

t0

e3q2/2t0

t2
0  22eq2/t0

,

(5.17)

is a transcendental equation for the eigenvalue, as is readily seen by direct evaluation of the integral:

2 =

t
2

ln

t + 

t    1,

29

(5.18)

where t  t0/ and we have assumed 2 > 0. if 2 < 0 we write   i and the equation becomes

1  2 =

t


t(cid:19) .
tan1(cid:18) 

(5.19)

it is immediately clear that a solution exists in this case only for 2 = 2 < 1.
if we analyze (5.18) we see that by varying t between  and  the r.h.s. takes on values between
0 and , thus there is a solution to this equation for any value of . for the special case of  = 0,
a more careful analysis of this equation also yields a solution. for a given eigenvalue solution to
(5.18) the eigenfunction is given by

2(q) =

eq2/t0

2(cid:0)t2  2eq2/t0(cid:1)z d2k

t0

2(k)ek2/2t0,

(5.20)

where the integral on the r.h.s. represents a number that can be xed by normalization.

if we refer back to (5.16) we see that if t2 < 2, then a delta function term restricting momentum

to energy shell may be added. for s-waves (non s-waves are free), we then have

2(q) = a(cid:18)q2  t0 ln

2

t2(cid:19) +

2(k)ek2/2t0,

(5.21)

where the coecient of the delta function can be xed via the following equation which relates a
to the normalization of the wavefunction,

t0

eq2/t0

2(cid:0)t2  2eq2/t0 + i(cid:1)z d2k

a

t0 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

t

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

in this case, t2 < 2, there is no restriction on the value of t, thus this solution corresponds to
the continuum. to summarize the spectrum of t2
0 includes a discrete s-wave bound state and a
0 < 22. clearly the discrete state will not change drastically in the limit   0,
continuum for t2
but the continuum would be dramatically squeezed to a set of measure zero in this limit.

5.3 strong coupling m = 6 scalar fishnet

the starting point for evaluating the strong coupling m = 6 bit scalar shnet diagrams is eq. (4.8).
for n = m/2 = 3 the equation to solve is

(cid:16)t2  23e(q2

where we have used kij = ki  kj. by working in the center of mass frame, we can replace
q3  q1  q2 and the equation becomes
(cid:16)t2  23e(q2

2+q1q2)/t0z d2k1
3(q1/2 + q2/2 + k21,q1/2 + k32,q2/2 + k13)e(k2

d2k3

if we change the integration variables k2 and k3 on the r.h.s. to

p1 = q1/2 + q2/2 + k21,

p2 = q1/2 + k32,

(5.25)

30

then we see that 3 in the integrand on the r.h.s. is independent of k1, so the gaussian integral
over k1 may be trivially performed by completing the square.

once this has been done the result is

(cid:16)t2  23e(q2

(p1  q1 + 2p1  q2  p2  q1 + p2  q2)(cid:21) .

(5.26)

in this equation we see that except for the last term in the exponential on the r.h.s. this integral
equation only depends on the scalar quantity, q2
2 + q1  q2. this is not surprising since this
scalar quantity is proportional to q2
3 and is the only cyclically invariant (qi  qi+1) scalar
of order q2. we next perform another change of variables,

1 + q2

2 + q2

1 + q2

q1t0

= u1 + u2,

q2t0

= u1  u2,

p1t0

= v1 + v2,

p2t0

= v1  v2,

(5.27)

remembering that qi, pi and now ui, vi are euclidean 2-vectors. with these substitutions our
equation becomes

1+u2

(cid:16)t2  23e(3u2
 exp(cid:20)
3(cid:0)3v2

1
3

u2  v2(cid:21) .

if we rescale u2 and v2 by a factor of 3, then we can make the o(4) symmetry manifest (up to
the last four terms in the exponential on the r.h.s.) by combining u1 and u2 (v1 and v2) into a
euclidean 4-vector u (v). thus the equation may be written as

(5.28)

43

where

(cid:16)t2  23e3u2(cid:17) 3(u) =
u1  3u3
u2  3u4
u3 + 3u1
u4 + 3u2
the vector function w has the property that

and

w(u) 

kwk pw(u)  w(u) = 2kuk,

2 e7u2/2z d4v 3(v)e2v2+vw(u),



u =





u1
u2
u3
u4

,

.

(5.29)

(5.30)

(5.31)

so while the function w does break o(4) invariance it does conserve o(4) length. thus we can
search for an o(4) invariant solution to this equation which is a function only of this length.
although this will not yield the most general eigenstate, it is expected to include the ground state.
plugging in this ansatz, the equation simplies to

(cid:16)t2  23e3u 2(cid:17) 3(u ) =

43

2 e7u 2/2z v 3dv 3(v )e2v 2z dvevw(u),

(5.32)

where u  kuk and v  kvk. the angular integral on the r.h.s. may be evaluated with standard
techniques,

z dvevw(u) = 4z 1

,

(5.33)

22i1(2u v )

u v

where i1(x) is the modied bessel function regular at x = 0.

thus the integral equation to solve is

t23(u ) = 23e3u 2

3(u ) + 83 e7u 2/2

u

z v 2dv i1(2u v )3(v )e2v 2

.

(5.34)

the rst thing to note is that for 2 = 0 the eigenfunction solution is a gaussian of the form

3(u ) = eu 2

,

where

 =

3 + 105

.

for this solution the corresponding eigenvalue is

(5.35)

(5.36)

t2 =

643

(cid:0)11 + 105(cid:1)2 .

both of these match the values predicted by equations (4.23) and (4.28) for n = 3. for 2 away
from zero we can solve this integral equation by means of an iterative procedure. starting with the
solution for 2 = 0 we can iterate the r.h.s. of (5.34) repeatedly. this is a convenient way of solving
this equation since the functions generated by the integral on the r.h.s. are always gaussian. thus
at each iteration step the solution will be of the form

3(u ) =xn

cnenu 2

,

(5.37)

with the number of terms in the sum doubling after each iteration. for a solution of this form it
can be shown that the corresponding eigenvalue, t2, is given by

t2 = 2 +

.

we have tested this iteration procedure numerically and for values of 2 small (2 < 0.3) we see
that the wavefunction/eigenvalue converges to a well-dened function/value. for 2 larger (closer
to 1) this becomes murkier as one needs a lot more iterations for the convergence to a value distinct
from 2 to be evident. another interesting phenomenon is that for 2 . 0.11, then t2 becomes
negative indicating that no physical solution exists.

6 conclusion

in this article, we have rened and extended an approach, proposed in the late seventies, to obtain
the large nc limit of qcd by directly summing the planar diagrams which survive. the basic tool
is to dene the planar diagrams using light-front space-time coordinates for which ix+ and the p+

32

carried by each gluon are discretized. this eectively digitizes the sum of diagrams, a rst step
toward a numerical evaluation. it also regulates the usual divergences of feynman diagrams. we
identied several shortcomings of the discretized model of qcd attempted in [5], and we proposed
an improved formulation which at least mitigates, and might well overcome, these defects.

discretization enables a formal strong t hooft coupling limit of the sum of diagrams. a major
disadvantage of the discretization of [5] was that this formal limit suppressed the cubic gluonic
interaction essential for the anti-ferromagnetic ordering of glueball mass levels: the dominant
quartic interaction ordered levels ferromagnetically. our new discretized model replaces the quartic
interactions by the exchange of two kinds of ctitious short-lived scalars, so that all interactions
can compete on an equal footing in the strong coupling limit. the ambiguities inherent in such a
replacement can also be exploited to remove unwanted symmetry violations induced by the usual
ultraviolet divergences present in the continuum limit.

having dened our discretized model, we explored its physical properties in several ways. we
rst studied the nature of weak coupling perturbation theory by calculating the gluon self energy
to one loop order, regaining the known continuum answer. this calculation showed how the dis-
cretization regulates ultraviolet divergences, and how the ambiguities in the model begin to be xed
by the restoration of poincare invariance. although we have not done a two loop calculation, there
is sucient exibility in these ambiguities to hope to achieve poincare invariance to all orders in
perturbation theory. the discretized model can also be studied in the strong coupling limit, but
in this article we just began this study for qcd by looking only at states with very small total
p + = m m for m = 2, where the dynamics is so drastically simplied that it can be solved exactly.
we defer to a future publication studies of qcd at m = 3 and higher. the continuum limit, of
course, will require m  .
as a warmup for going to larger values of m , we evaluated the strong coupling limit in a
paradigm matrix scalar eld theory with only cubic interactions. not surprisingly, the bosonic
light-cone string was obtained. although this paradigm model yielded some useful insights into
the nature of large planar diagrams, we stressed that the corresponding qcd calculation will have
profound dierences: for one thing the gluons carry spin, and for another their interactions show
both repulsion and attraction depending on the quantum numbers of the channel. in contrast, the
interactions of the scalar theory are exclusively attractive. because of this, the strong coupling
limit forced the p+ carried by each scalar quantum to be minimal, i.e. one discretized unit m. this
circumstance prevented a liouville degree of freedom, associated with collective uctuations of
the p + distribution amongst the scalar quanta, from arising. thus the limit must be interpreted
as a critical string theory.

the diversity of interaction signs of qcd will obviously complicate this outcome. it is possible,
and a major focus for future study, that cancellations deemphasize the contributions where all
quanta carry the minimum p+ to such a degree that a collective liouville eld emerges. then the
strong coupling limit might be a subcritical version of one of the existing string models.
if so,
the liouville world-sheet eld could be thought of as a fth dimension, and the dual description
of our model as a eld theory at weak coupling and a subcritical string theory at strong coupling
would resemble the ads/cft duality of [2, 16, 17]. another logical possibility, though, is that
the strong coupling limit of large nc qcd is actually a novel critical string theory with critical
dimension 4. of course, it could also turn out that the attempt to reach a reasonable poincare
invariant strong coupling limit of large nc qcd simply fails. after all, continuum qcd is, strictly
speaking, not an innite coupling theory in any sense of the word. the coupling is scale dependent
and corresponds to no tunable parameter at all. the strong coupling limit, as everyone knows,
describes the discretized model and can vary wildly from one discretization to another.

33

much has been said about the holographic nature of the duality mentioned above. we would
like to conclude with a few comments about this. the hologram metaphor was invented by t
hooft [18] to describe a possible resolution of the information loss paradox of quantum black
holes. since the horizon of a black hole is two dimensional, it should be possible to describe all of
three dimensional physics by a two dimensional quantum theory. the discretized model we have
presented here is not holographic in this sense. the transverse space of a light front is indeed
two dimensional, but the third longitudinal dimension has not been eliminated: it is present in the
disguised form of a variable newtonian mass m m for each gluon. however, the model is holographic
in the higher dimensional sense described by witten [17]. the fundamental discretized model is
3 + 1 dimensional, 2 transverse dimensions, variable p+ and x+. however in the strong coupling
limit we expect 4 + 1 dimensions: the x of light-cone string should emerge as a function of the
transverse and liouville degrees of freedom. holography in t hoofts sense would require a more
profound circumstance: there should be no liouville eld and the variable p+ of each gluon must
itself be a mere collective eect. for example, the gluon with m units of p+ might be thought of
as a bound system of m minimal p+ bits [19]. in that case, the model presented here would just
be a stepping stone toward that more fundamental theory.

a appendix: alternate discretization

in this appendix we explore the ramications of the alternate discretization eq. (2.8) of d. the
bare propagator in energy representation is

d

0

(q, m, e) =

t0(eae  1)

m 2

u
1  u

.

(a.1)

the self-energy parts kl, k+ and ++ will of course have dierent values in this discretization,
but the decompositions (3.5) remain valid. under the assumption that 
1 = 1, the relations
of the exact propagators to the s are identical to (3.6) except for d for which the relation is

1 = 

d =

t0

m 2 (cid:20)

u(eae  1  q2/2m t0)

1  u  t0u1(eae  1  q2/2m t0)

+

q2

2m t0

u

1  u  u2i /2m(cid:21) .

(a.2)

the only parts of the one loop self energy calculation aected by the dierent discretization
are the two diagrams, fig. 12, which have a d propagator as one of the internal lines. the
evaluation is quite dierent for this discretization because the completion of squares in the second
term of eq. (2.8) leads to dierent factors than the rst term. the contribution of the rst term
involves the exponent

k

2t0 (cid:18) p2

l

+

(q  p)2
m  l (cid:19) =

l(m  l)

+

q2

m (cid:19) ,

(a.3)

whereas the contribution of the second term involves

(k  1)p2

2t0l

k(q  p)2
2t0(m  l)

=

m (k  1) + l! , (a.4)
k(k  1)q2

for one of the two diagrams, and for the other a similar expression with p  q p and l  m  l.
thus the two contribute equally to

the violation of galilei invariance caused by the this alternate discretization is apparent from the
non-polynomial dependence on q2. however, one can easily see that each power of q2 comes with
an accompanying power of 1/m . at most one power of m is supplied by the prefactors, so all
powers of q2 higher than the rst are irrelevant in the continuum limit.

in order to compare our results to the continuum calculation of ref. [8], we must examine
the limits u  1 and m  . the behavior of the rst two terms of eq. (a.8) in this limit is
transparent once we use the identity (3.31). the continuum limit of the last term requires a bit
more analysis. first, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, we only need keep two terms in the
expansion of the exponential:

the sums over l can be approximated using the euler-maclaurin summation formula, see eq. (4.30),
as long as f is not singular at the endpoints of integration. clearly terms with 1/l in the summand
must be treated separately, which is easily handled using (3.26). applying these formulae, we nd

remembering that our 2 is a factor of q2/t0 times that dened in ref. [8], we nd agreement
for the coecient of ln q2, provided we identify 2m t0 with 2. the rst two groups of terms on the
r.h.s. of eq. (a.16) violate important symmetries and must be removed by explicit counter-terms.
the term linear in q2 violates galilei invariance and the momentum independent terms imply a
nite gluon mass squared in perturbation theory, thus violating poincare invariance. note that

36

the necessary counter terms are low order polynomials in both the transverse momentum and in
the discretized p +. without the tadpole contributions the discretization used in the text would
have required counter-terms with logarithmic m dependence. but we found (at least at one-loop)
that the tadpoles could be designed to eliminate the need for counter-terms. then the fact that it
preserves galilei invariance makes it the superior choice.
