abstract: we identify two distinct, complementary classes of gauge eld cong-
urations for qcd with su(2) gauge group, one (instanton-like congurations) having
to do with chiral symmetry breaking but not with connement, the other (regularized
wu-yang monopoles) very likely responsible for connement but unrelated to chiral
symmetry breaking. our argument is based on a semiclassical analysis of fermion zero
modes in these backgrounds, made by use of a gauge eld decomposition recently in-
troduced by faddeev and niemi. our result suggests that the two principal dynamical
phenomena in qcd, connement and chiral symmetry breaking, are distinct eects,
caused by two competing classes of gauge eld congurations.

it is now widely accepted that connement in quantum chromodynamics (qcd)
is a kind of dual superconductivity [1, 2, 3]. according to this idea, the ground state
of qcd is a condensate of magnetic monopoles. color electric elds are expelled from
the hadronic medium, except as possible thin laments (abrikosov votex) connecting
quarks and antiquarks, leading to a linearly rising potential between them.

the details of this phenomen is dicult to analyse, though, due to the fact that
the role of the cooper pairs in the standard superconductors is here played by topo-
logically nontrivial soliton-like congurations. actually, the situation is worse since,
unlike what happens in theories with elementary scalar elds in the adjoint repre-
sentation, magnetic monopoles in qcd do not correspond to any stable solitonic
solutions of the classical yang-mills equations of motion. in fact such a static solu-
tion is known not to exist in pure yang-mills theories. rather they represent sets of
regularized wu-yang monopole congurations, whose presence may be conveniently
detected by t hoofts abelianization procedure [2].

a new decomposition of the non-abelian gauge elds recently proposed by fad-
deev and niemi [4, 5] makes these ideas more concrete; it appears to enables us to
analyse the relevant physics aspects in more detail, without the need of choosing
particular gauges such as the maximally abelian gauge [6].

as an example, we discuss here the possible connection between connement and
chiral symmetry breaking in qcd. we shall argue that congurations responsible
for connement and for chiral symmetry breaking are quite distinct and in a sense
complementary, in qcd.

a key aspect in discussing such a connection is the existence of the fermion zero
modes in the background of the semiclassical monopoles [7]. in fact, the connection
between these two dynamical phenomena has been recently illucidated in full nonper-
turbative analysis, in many su(nc) or usp(2nc) theories with n = 2 supersymmetry
(broken softly to n = 1) [8, 9]. we shall not discuss here physics of these models
(which show very rich varieties of nonperturbative scenarios, some resembling those in
the actual world of strong interactions, some quite dierent); for the present purpose
we shall only draw one lesson from these studies. namely the existence of the fermion
zero modes in the background of semiclassical monopoles, is a necessary condition for
the low-energy, light magnetic monopoles to carry avor quantum numbers, hence a
condition for their condensation (connement) to imply chiral symmetry breaking.

the models of [8, 9] contain t hooft-polyakov monopoles [10] in the spectrum.

1

the existence and number of the zero modes for each fermion can be (and has been)
established both explicitly (by generalizing the analysis by jackiw and rebbi) and
through callias index theorem [11]. the resulting semiclassical avor multiplet struc-
ture can be compared with the spectrum of low-energy massless (fully quantum me-
chanical) monopoles, with complete matching between the two [9].

in qcd, one might instead use the background congurations which are presum-
ably dominant in its ground state [12, 13]. for simplicity, we discuss here qcd with
su(2) gauge group. candidate congurations we shall consider are (regularized)
wu-yang monopoles, instantons, and modication/collection of these. according to
faddeev and niemi, the su(2) connection can be decomposed as

aa

 = cna + (x)(n  n)a +  na;

(x) = 1 + (x),

(1)

in terms of the unit vector eld n and the abelian gauge eld c which live on s2 and
s1 factors, respectively, of su(2) = s3  s2  s1 manifold, and a charged scalar
eld

 = (x) + i(x).

(2)

in terms of these variables, the wu-yang singular monopole solution [14], for instance,
is

na =

xa
r

, c =  = 0.

(3)

thanks to the presence of the other degrees of freedom, one might think that in
the dominant congurations such singularities are actually regularized by the zero of
1  ||2.

indeed, the standard yang-mills action written in these variables reads

s = 

1

4g2 z d4x f 2

 = 

1

4g2 z d4x { [g + (1  ||2) h]2 +
n  n (d)(d)]

n  n (d)(d)  x6=

+ 2 [x6=
 i [(d)(d)  (d)(d)] h } + { - term},

(4)

2

where 1

g = c  c;  =  + i, h = (n  n  n);

d = (  ic).

(5)

(6)

in the case of the wu-yang monopole, the singularity in the energy at the origin
comes from the behavior h 2

ij = 2/r4.

note that the local u(1) invariance (corresponding to su(2) gauge transforma-
tions of the form u = exp in   /2) is manifest in eq.(4). fixing the direction
of n (by gauge transformations belonging to su(2)/u(1)) as n = (0, 0, 1), for ex-
ample, amounts to the abelian gauge xing:
for the n conguration of the form,
na = xa
r , such a gauge transformation would introduce an (apparently) singular dirac
monopole, even though the gauge eld conguration itself is perfectly regular.

a curious feature of faddeev-niemi decomposition, that the connection contains
(x) = 1 + (x) (and (x)) naturally while the action depends on (x) (and (x)) in
a simple and signicant way, is central to our discussion.

before going into our main argument, let us note, following faddeev and niemi,
that the form of eq.(4) suggests a very clear picture of dierent possible phases of
qcd. namely, if the eld (x) uctuates more strongly than the n eld, one could
integrate the former rst, in the sence of renormalization group, arriving at a low-
energy eective action of qcd,

f n = z d4x {2 x
sef f

n  n + x6=

(n  n  n)2},

(7)

suggested in [4], describing the connement phase of qcd ( is a dynamically gen-
eraled mass). this action has two important features, one being the unique action
containing n eld and allowing for hamiltonian interpretation, and second, contain-
ing topological solitons [15] which could be thought as models of gluonia. though
very interesting, it is not our main interest here to pursue these ideas further.

1the  term has also quite an elegant form,



322 z d4x f

f  =



642  z d4x {[g + (1  ||2) h  ][g + (1  ||2) h ]

+ i [(d)(d )  (d )(d)] h }.

3

vice versa, if dynamically n eld uctuates more, renormalization group ow

would instead yield a low energy action which looks more like

f n = z d4x { g2
sef f 

  (d)(d) + (1  ||2)2}

(8)

which is the standard higgs model (describing a possible higgs phase). finally, if
none of the elds uctuate strongly, then one would have the original yang-mills
action at low energies: one is in the non-abelian coulomb phase in this case (this
will be the case if a sucient number of massless fermions are present).

though obviously over-simplied, these observations do show that eld congu-
rations which contribute to nonvanishing vev hi 6= 0 tend to bring the system to the
higgs phase (short-ranged color electric force); connement is caused by congura-
tions giving rise to dual higgs phase (hence with hi = 0).

a zero-energy static left-handed quark eld satises the equation (we shall consider

the massless quarks for simplicity)

i(k)[k  i(ckna + (kn  n)a +  kna)

 a
2

]ij lj = 0.

(9)

which follows from the standard covariant weyl equation

i(  ia)l = 0,

(10)

with a taken in the faddeev-niemi form. the exact u(1) local invariance was used
to set c0(x) = 0 above.

as is well known the dirac hamiltonian (the operator multiplying l in eq.(9))

commutes with the total angular momentum operator,

j = l + s +


2

,

(11)

composed of the orbital and spin angular momenta and the gauge su(2) spin. for
this reason one seeks for a singlet zero mode having the general structure

(l)i = i 2

i gl(r) + ( a 2)i rahl(r).

(12)

the functions gl(r) and hl(r) satisfy the coupled equations, (jl(r)  rhl(r)):

] jl = 0,

(13)

where we have set

ck(x) = rkc(r),

(14)

and assumed spherically symmetric forms for c(r), (r), and (r).

let us rst consider the case of an instanton background at x0 = 0,

na(x) =

xa
r

;

(r) = 2 r2 f (x);

f (x) =

1

r2 + 2 ;

c(r) = (r) = 0,

(15)

where  is the instanton size. this is actually only the instanton conguration at
x0 = 0, the static conguration relevant to the three dimensional zero mode. we
shall loosely refer to it as the instanton below. note that the monopole singularity
at the origin is smoothened by the zero of 1  ||2 since (x)  0 (or (x)  1) as
r  0 and   0. eq.(13) can be immediately integrated in this case and gives

gl = er r

0

dr 

r =

1

r2 + 2 ;

jl = 0,

(16)

which is the well-known three-dimensional zero mode of the lefthanded fermion [16],
related to the four-dimensional euclidean zero mode by the spectral-ow argument
[13]. the instanton background at x0 6= 0 does not allow for three-dimensional fermion
zero modes.

note also that there is another independent solution of eq.(13)

gl = 0;

jl(r) = exp z r

0

dr

2  

r

,

(17)

which is however not normalizable.

of course, the precise form of the instanton background is not needed for the exis-
tence of the normalizable fermion zero mode. the essential features of the background
(15) are:

i) the hedgehog form of the n eld;

ii) the behavior of the (r) eld (in the gauge rho = 0),

(0) = 0;

(r) r 2

(or (r) r 1).

(18)

in fact, the rst of (18) guarantees that the gauge conguration is regular at the origin
and that the zero mode is normalizable at the origin, while the second, which means
that it looks like a monopole of charge 2 from the distance, leads to the asymptotic

5

behavior of the fermion zero mode, gl  1/r2, compatible with the normalizability
at r  .

another example of conguration of this class is the di-meron conguration [17, 16]

na(x) =

xa
r

;

(r) = r


r

r(x); c(r) = (r) = 0,

r(x) = log[r2 + y2  t2 + {r2 + (t  y)2}1/2{r2 + (t + y)2}1/2];

(19)

for y < t < y (2y is the two-meron separation).

in fact we can consider a more general class of congurations with these character-
istics, with possibly c(r) 6= 0, (r) 6= 0, and call these instanton-like congurations.
although one has coupled equations for the system (gl, jl), one can quite generally
assume that a normalizable solution (gl, jl) exists if c(r) and  are suciently small.

the instanton-like congurations may then well have to do with the chiral sym-
metry breaking, since in the collection of such congurations (instanton liquid [18])
the chiral symmetry breaking vevs

huruli = h drdli 6= 0

(20)

will be nonvanishing.

instanton-like congurations are on the other hand of no use from the point of view
of connement. in fact, the asymptotic behavior of the  eld means that ||  1 at
innity, suggesting that instanton-like congurations tend to bring the system into
the higgs phase 2. this is consistent with the general idea that the instantons, being
point-like in four dimensions, have nothing to do with connement, but our argument
is based on the three dimensional properties of these congurations.

consider next the class of congurations with the following characteristics:

i) the n eld is the hedgehog form na = xa/r;

ii) the (r) eld behaves as (we set  = 0 by the u(1) gauge transformation),

namely

2see [22] for recent related ideas.

(0) = 0;

(r) r 1,

aa

i = (x) aij

xj
r2 + . . .

6

(21)

(22)

which we call regularized wu-yang monopole congurations. the dierence of factor
2 in the asymptotic behavior of (x) eld as compared to the instanton-like cong-
urations, is crucial. it means that, on the one hand, (r)  0 (  0) at innity
so these congurations are consistent with connement; on the other hand, it implies
that the fermion zero modes are non-normalizable (see below).

note that the single meron conguration at a xed time slice

xa
r

;

r(x); c(r) = (r) = 0,

na(x) =


r
r(x) = log[{r2 + t2}1/2  t],

(r) = r

(23)

is of this type: in fact this class of congurations may alternatively be called meron-
like congurations.

if (collection of) these congurations are indeed dominant in the ground state of
qcd, it will lead to dual meissner eect (connement), as suggested by t hooft,
mandelstam and nambu.

these congurations however do not trigger chiral symmetry breaking, since there
are no normalizable fermion zero modes in this case. in fact if we assume c(r) = 0
for simplicity, one of the solutions of the zero-energy equation is again

gl = er r

0

dr 

r

(24)

but this is not normalizable at innity, because it behaves as gl  1/r. in the case of
the meron conguration this solution coincides with the one given in [16]. the other
solution jl(r) (eq.(17)) is non-normalizable in this case, too. again, we could allow
for nonvanishing c(r) and (r) elds, but it is clear that for quite general class of
perturbations these solutions will remain both non-normalizable.

we conclude that regularized wu-yang monopoles (or rather collections of those)
are fundamental for connement but have in themselves nothing to do with chiral
symmetry breaking. it is quite remarkable that one can identify, through the analysis
of semiclassical fermion zero modes, two distinct and complementary sets of cong-
urations: one (instanton-like congurations) has likely to do with chiral symmetry
breaking but with no relation to connement and the other (regularized wu-yang
monopoles) being most likely responsible for connement but are, as they are, unre-
lated to chiral symmetry breaking. this suggests that the two main nonperturbative
eects of qcd, connement and chiral symmetry breaking, are distinct eects, and

7

in particuar that the latter (chiral symmetry breaking) is not a direct consequence of
the former (connement). there are hints that support this conclusion in the lattice
approach to qcd [19].

in fact, our conclusion overlaps considerably with that of callan et. al. [13], but
the use of the faddeev-niemi decomposition appears to allow for a particularly simple
way to relate the question of chiral symmetry breaking (existence or absence of the
fermion zero modes) to that of connement.

we conclude with several comments.

1. the fact that the asymptotic value of  is quantized (in the gauge (x) = 0),

(r) r n, n  z,

(25)

is fundamental to our discussion. (25) must be imposed on the faddeev-niemi
construction. this is so because in the gauge n = (0, 0, 1) and for  = 0, ()
represents the charge of the magnetic monopole (see eq.(22)), which should
obey diracs quantization condition for consistency if fermions are present in
the theory. it should be noted that although n eld represents 2(su(2)/u(1))
hence can be devided into integer classes of winding number s2  s2, this fact
alone is not sucient to guarantee the integer monopole charge.

2. our analysis seems to shed some new light on the long-standing question of the
interplay between the instantons and the monopoles in qcd. although they
are clearly not totally unrelated, their relations [20] can be rather subtle. for
instance, in the exact seiberg-witten solution [8] of n = 2 supersymmetric
gauge theories, the renormalization of the  parameter is due to the innite
sum of instanton contributions, but in the dual language more adequate at low
energies it is seen as due to the perturbative loops of magnetic monopoles. see
also an earlier related idea [21] and recent related results in nite temperature
qcd [22].

3. it is known that connement can occur without chiral symmetry breaking, as
is exemplied in many supersymmetric models, supporting our idea that these
two phenomena are in principle distinct. for example, in the massless n = 1
supersymmetric qcd with nf = nc + 1, the low-energy degrees of freedom
are mesons and baryons and their superpartners (connement), while chiral
symmetries remain unbroken in one of the possible vacua [23]. it is suggestive

8

that this occurs precisely in a theory in which the eects of instantons are known
to be relatively weak [23].

4. the work of faddeev and niemi generalizes an earlier proposal by cho [24],

who required that the gauge connection satisfy

whose solution is simply

dn = 0,

aa

(x) = cna + (n  n)a.

(26)

(27)

the eld tensor decomposes as a sum of electric and magnetic parts,

f = g + h; g = c  c; h = (n  n  n),

(28)

where h contains the (wu-yang) magnetic monopole for n eld of hedgehog
form. the decomposition by faddeev and niemi continues to share this nice
property, but having extra degrees of freedom ((x)) is capable of accomodating
larger classes of regular eld congurations which are needed in our discussion.

5. actually, the decomposition of the su(2) connection used here is not a fully
general one. aa
(x) is expressed in terms of six independent functions (after
taking into account of the local u(1) invariance, one has two physical degrees of
freedom in c, two for n and two more from (x)), which matches the number of
the physical degrees of freedom of aa
(x). they were shown to be complete [4] in
the sense that yang-mills equations of motions are correctly reproduced by those
for c(x), n(x), (x). of course, as functional integration variables one needs
two more degrees of freedom, and the faddeev-niemi decomposition has been
accordingly generalized recently [25]. the original on-shell decomposition,
however, seems to contain just sucient number of degrees of freedom (i.e., a
just suciently wide classes of congurations) for the purpose of the present
exploratory study.

6. very recently davies et.al.[26] have computed the gluino condensate in pure n =
1 supersymmetric yang-mills theory, by compactifying the time coordinate on a
cylinder, and by using the gluino zero mode in the background of the standard
bps monopole for aa
0(x) appears as the higgs scalar). one might wonder
whether the absence of fermion zero modes in the background of the regularized

i (x) (aa

9

wu-yang monopole we noted, is compatible with their work.
in fact, if one
repeats our analysis in the case of a fermion in the adjoint representation of the
gauge group, one does nd a pair of zero modes in the background of regularized
wu-yang monopole background. the simplest way to get this result is to set
the yukawa coupling to zero in the original analysis of jackiw and rebbi [7].
in the case of the fundamental fermion, it can be seen that the normalizable
jackiw-rebbi zero mode becomes non-normalizable 3, which is compatible with
the absence of normalizable zero modes we found here. on the other hand, the
(pair of) normalizable zero modes found in [7] continue to be normalizable in
the limit of the vanishing yukawa coupling in the case of an adjoint fermion 4
which is consistent with the calculation of [26].

7. in an alternative qcd with quarks in the adjoint representation, only the regu-
larized wu-yang congurations would lead to connement while chiral symme-
try breaking can be caused by both types of congurations. it is thus possible
that at some nite temperature chiral symmetry breaking can occur without
connement, as suggested by kogut et. al. [19], if instanton-like congurations
dominate over wu-yang monopole like congurations.
