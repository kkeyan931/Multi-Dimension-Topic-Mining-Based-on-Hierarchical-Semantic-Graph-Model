area law corrections from state counting and supergravity

1. introduction

a microscopic derivation of the entropy of certain extremal black holes has recently
become available in the context of string theory [1]-[6]. for four-dimensional extremal
black holes in the limit of large electric/magnetic charges q, the microscopic entropy is
generically of the form

smicro  qq4 .

(1)

this result agrees with the one obtained from macroscopic calculations based on the
corresponding eective eld theories. here one rst constructs the associated black hole
solution and then one computes the macroscopic entropy according to the bekenstein-
hawking area law [7, 8].

in the context of string theory and m-theory, the microscopic entropy (1) is
calculated by counting excitations of d-branes and m-branes. in the context of type-iia
compactications on calabi-yau threefolds cy3 extremal black holes are microscopically
represented by wrapping a d4-brane on a smooth holomorphic four-cycle p of the
calabi-yau threefold and by considering its bound state with |q0| d0-branes.
in m-
theory compactications on cy3  s1, on the other hand, they are represented by
ve-branes wrapped on p  s1, with |q0| quanta of lightlike momentum along the circle
s1. the massless excitations of the ve-brane wrapped on p are described by a (0, 4)
two-dimensional conformal theory [5], and the degeneracy of states of this conformal
eld theory yields the microscopic entropy according to cardys formula,

d(|q0|, cl)  exp(smicro)  exp(cid:16)2q 1

6|q0|cl (cid:17) .

(2)

here |q0| is taken to be large and cl denotes the central charge for the left-moving sector.
evaluation of (2) for the case of a ve-brane wrapped around p  s1 yields [5],

smicro = 2r 1

6|q0|(cid:16)cabc papbpc + c2a pa(cid:17) ,

(3)

where cabc and c2a denote the triple intersection numbers and the second chern class
numbers of the calabi-yau threefold, respectively. the charges pa denote the expansion
coecients of the four-cycle p in a homology basis a of four-cycles, p = paa. in
obtaining (3) the topological data of the four-cycle p have been expressed in terms of
topological data of the calabi-yau threefold.

the calabi-yau compactication reduces the number of supersymmetries to eight,
so that the black hole solution has n = 2 supersymmetry at spatial innity. one may
also consider compactications on k3  t 2 or on t 6 with the ve-brane wrapping a
four-cycle.
in that case one has n = 4 or n = 8 supersymmetry at spatial innity
while the massless excitations are still described by a (0, 4) two-dimensional conformal
eld theory. hence one obtains entropy formulae similar to (3). we will return to them
later.

inspection of (3) shows that, for large charges pa, there are subleading corrections
(proportional to c2a) to the microscopic entropy.
it was argued in [5, 6] that these
deviations in the entropy formula should, at the macroscopic level, arise from terms

area law corrections from state counting and supergravity

in the eective action proportional to the square of the weyl tensor, with coecients
linearly related to the second chern class of the calabi-yau threefold.

the associated four-dimensional eective eld theory is based on n = 2
supergravity coupled to a number of vector multiplets whose gauge elds are associated
with electric and magnetic charges, denoted by qi and pi, respectively. the theory
incorporates, in a systematic fashion, the phenomenon of electric/magnetic duality,
according to which the electric and magnetic charges can be interchanged and/or rotated
and it includes higher-derivative couplings with among them a certain class of terms
quadratic in the weyl tensor. the eective theory is thus complicated and depends on
many elds. how can the macroscopic description of extremal n = 2 black holes then
be so constrained and systematic as to precisely reproduce the results from the counting
of microstates such as (3)? the crucial ingredient that is responsible for the remarkable
restrictions on the entropy formulae obtained on the basis of these complicated eective
eld theories is the enhancement to full supersymmetry at the horizon. the black hole
solutions that we consider are static, rotationally symmetric solitonic interpolations
between two n = 2 supersymmetric groundstates: at minkowski spacetime at spatial
innity and bertotti-robinson spacetime at the horizon [9, 10]. the interpolating
solution preserves n = 1 supersymmetry so that we are dealing with a bps conguration
and the black hole is extremal. the interpolating solution depends, generically, on the
electric and magnetic charges as well as on the values of the moduli elds at spatial
innity. the supersymmetry enhancement at the horizon is responsible for the xed-
point behaviour of the moduli forcing them to take certain values depending on the
electric/magnetic charges at the horizon [11, 12]. the precise relation can be deduced
from electric-magnetic duality considerations [13, 10]. the near-horizon geometry is
thus entirely determined in terms of the charges carried by the black hole, and so is the
entropy.

2. supersymmetric black hole solutions

the supergravity lagrangians that give rise to these extremal black hole solutions are
based on the coupling of n vector multiplets to n = 2 supergravity. they contain
various other couplings, such as those associated with hypermultiplets, which play only
a limited role in the following and will be omitted. the construction of the coupling of
vector multiplets to n = 2 supergravity utilizes the so-called superconformal multiplet
calculus [14] which enables one to straightforwardly include the interactions proportional
to the square of the weyl tensor. let us recall that the covariant elds of a vector
multiplet, the eld strength of the vector gauge eld, a complex scalar, a doublet of
gaugini and a triplet of auxiliary scalar elds, constitute a restricted chiral multiplet.
the complex scalar elds are denoted by x i. we consider only abelian vector multiplets,
which we label by i = 0, 1, . . . , n. the extra vector multiplet is required to provide the
graviphoton eld of supergravity. the supersymmetric (wilsonian) action is encoded
in a holomorphic function f (x) of the scalars (or, in superspace, of the corresponding

area law corrections from state counting and supergravity

4

chiral superelds). under electric/magnetic duality transformations the function f (x)
changes, but the corresponding equations of motion and bianchi identities remain the
same.

 = 2di  1

in the superconformal framework there is another multiplet, the so-called weyl
multiplet, which comprises the gravitational degrees of freedom, namely the graviton,
two gravitini as well as various other superconformal gauge elds and also some auxiliary
elds. one of these auxiliary elds is an anti-selfdual lorentz tensor eld t ab ij, where
i, j = 1, 2 denote chiral su(2) indices, which occurs in the gravitino transformation law
8ab j t abij +   . the covariant quantities of the weyl
according to i
multiplet also reside in a reduced chiral multiplet, denoted by w ab ij, from which one
constructs the unreduced chiral multiplet w 2 = (w ab ijij)2 [15]. the lowest component
eld of w 2 is equal to a = (t ab ijij)2. because w 2 is also a chiral multiplet, we
can simply include interactions between the vector multiplets and the weyl multiplet
by extending the holomorphic function to a function that depends both on x i and
a. however, this function must be homogeneous of degree two and thus satises
x ifi + 2 a f a = 2f , where fi = f/x i , f a = f/ a. the most prominent
interaction term that is induced by the a-dependence is quadratic in the weyl tensor
and proportional to the derivative f a. note that there are no terms proportional to the
derivative of the riemann tensor.

our rst task is to nd all n = 2 supersymmetric eld congurations (in the full
o-shell theory) that are consistent with the static, spherically symmetric, black hole
geometry, which in isotropic coordinates (t, r, , ) is described by the line element

ds2 = e2g(r)dt2 + e2f (r)(dr2 + r2d2) .

(4)

an o-shell analysis which includes general interactions with the weyl multiplet [10]
reveals that there exists only one class of fully supersymmetric solutions, namely the
bertotti-robinson spacetime corresponding to ads2 s2. this geometry is thus relevant
for the black hole near the horizon or at spatial innity (where the anti-de sitter radius
tends to innity so that one is dealing with at minkowski spacetime). it is important
to stress here that we do not explicitly use the action or eld equations (except for
the abelian gauge elds which are induced by the presence of the electric/magnetic
black hole charges), as everything is encoded in the function f (x, a). the use of
an o-shell formulation is essential in view of the fact that the action is extremely
complicated and generates an innite sequence of higher-derivative interactions upon
integrating out the auxiliary elds. in this way one obtains, for instance, an innite
series of terms proportional to the square of the weyl tensor times powers of the eld
strengths associated with the vector multiplets. in view of the maximal supersymmetry
the corresponding eld equations must be satised.

the analysis of [10] shows that the x i and a must be constant (that is, in a certain
gauge; in principle only appropriate ratios are determined in view of the invariance
under local dilatations of the superconformal formulation) and that e2g(r) = e2f (r) =

area law corrections from state counting and supergravity

ek |z|2 r2, where

z = ek/2 (pifi(x, a)  qix i) ,
ek = i[ x i fi(x, a)  fi ( x,

a)x i] .

(5)

this shows that we are dealing with a spacetime geometry that is of the bertotti-
robinson type. note the dependence on the black hole magnetic and electric charges
(pi, qi). the quantities z and k are both generically non-vanishing and constant. it
was also found that t 01 ij = i t 23 ij = 2 ij ek/2 z 1, while all other components of
t ab ij vanish. therefore we have a = 64 ek z 2.

hence the fully supersymmetric eld congurations are characterized in terms
of the (constant) moduli x i (or rather, their ratios) and the electric/magnetic
charges. however, when the eld conguration satises the eld equations and the
bianchi identities, which we know must be the case, then it must also be consistent
with electric/magnetic duality. these equivalence transformations take the form of
symplectic sp(2n + 2; z) transformations. now we observe that both (pi, qj) and
(x i, fj) transform as symplectic vectors under duality transformations [16]. since
they are the only such vectors left in these supersymmetric congurations, they must
satisfy a proportionality relation, which in principle determines the x i in terms of the
charges [13, 10]. therefore fully supersymmetric eld congurations are completely
parametrized in terms of the charges. observe that this observation already indicates
that, also in the presence of higher-derivative interactions, the moduli will exhibit xed-
point behaviour at the horizon. an explicit proof of this will be presented elsewhere
[17].

what remains is to calculate the entropy for particular black hole solutions which
interpolate between the two dierent fully supersymmetric eld congurations at spatial
innity and at the horizon. since the behaviour at the horizon is completely determined
in terms of the charges, the resulting entropy formula will only depend on these charges.
however, if one computes the macroscopic entropy for a black hole of the type considered
in [5, 6] by using the area law of bekenstein and hawking, then one discovers [18] that
the resulting expression does not agree with the expression for the microscopic entropy
(3). thus, in order to obtain agreement with the counting of microstates provided by
string theory, one is forced to depart from the area law. for that reason we adopt
walds proposal for the entropy which ensures the validity of the rst law of black hole
mechanics for more generic eld theories. this proposal is based on the existence of
a noether charge associated with an isometry evaluated at the corresponding killing
horizon [19]. when evaluating this current subject to the eld equations, current
conservation becomes trivial and the current can be written as the divergence of an
antisymmetric tensor. this tensor, sometimes called the noether potential, is a local
function of the elds and of the (arbitrary) gauge transformation parameters. its integral
over the horizon yields the macroscopic entropy.

3. entropy as a noether charge

in order to elucidate walds noether charge proposal let us rst briey consider a simple
three-dimensional abelian gauge theory, with a gauge-invariant lagrangian depending
on the eld strength f,
its derivatives f, as well as on matter elds  and
rst derivatives thereof. furthermore we add a chern-simons term (which acts as a
topological mass term), so that the total lagrangian takes the form

ltotal = linv(f, f, ,  ) + c a a ,

(6)

where   is the covariant derivative of  and c is some constant. this lagrangian is
not gauge invariant but changes into a total derivative,

ltotal = n (, ) = c   a ,

(7)

where generically  denotes all the elds and  denotes the transformation parameter.
for eld congurations that satisfy the equations of motion, the corresponding noether
current can be written in terms of a so-called noether potential q, which in the case
at hand reads

q(, ) = 2 l   2 l,  + l,  + 2c a  .

(8)

here l and l, denote the derivatives of the action with respect to f and f,
respectively. observe that the bianchi identity implies l[,] = 0. the noether
potential, whose denition is not unambiguous, is a local function of the elds and
of the transformation parameter . observe that q does not have to vanish for eld
congurations that are invariant (in the case at hand, this would imply  =  = 0).
modulo equations of motion the corresponding noether current equals

j (, ) =  q(, ) .

(9)

note that the current depends only on the gauge parameter through the gauge variations
. this property is not automatic and in order to realize this we made a particular
choice for the noether potential, exploiting the ambiguity in its denition [20]

integration of the noether potential (8) over the boundary of some (spacelike)
hypersurface leads to a surface charge, which, when restricting the gauge transformation
parameters to those that leave the background invariant, is equal to the noether charge
in the usual sense.
in the case at hand this surface charge remains constant under
variations that continuously connect solutions of the equations of motion. here we
consider a continuous variety of solutions of the eld equations which are left invariant
under a corresponding variety of residual gauge transformations. hence, the parameters
 that characterize the residual symmetry may change continuously with the solution.
denoting the combined change of the solution  and of the symmetry parameters  by
the variation , one may thus write

() = 0 .

(10)

in our example the noether current can be written as a function of  and , so that
one knows that j(, ) remains proportional to  and must therefore vanish for the

area law corrections from state counting and supergravity

7

symmetric congurations. consequently q(, ) must vanish up to a closed form,
[], so that the surface charge obtained by integration over a cauchy surface c
with volume element d,

zc

d j (, ) = ic

d q(, ) ,

(11)

is constant under the variations induced by . observe that the integrand on the right-
hand side is in principle nonvanishing and nonconstant, so that the constancy of the
total surface charge represents a nontrivial result.

in general relativity one follows the same approach as in the above example.
the gauge transformations then take the form of dieomorphisms and the residual
gauge symmetries are associated with killing vectors. the lagrangian is not invariant
but transforms as a density, which implies that n (, )   l. proceeding as in
the example discussed above, the associated noether current gives rise to a noether
potential. however, in this case there are a number of complications when considering
variations of the surface charge. another essential ingredient is that the boundary
decomposes into two disconnected parts for black hole solutions, one associated with
spatial innity and one with the horizon. after identifying a surface charge that is
constant under variations within a continuous variety of solutions of the equations of
motion, the contributions coming from variations at spatial innity must cancel against
those coming from the horizon. it is this phenomenon that ensures the validity of the
rst law of black hole mechanics: the contributions originating from spatial innity
are related to variations of the black hole mass and angular momentum, while the
contributions originating from the horizon are identied with the change of the black
hole entropy (see [21, 22, 23] for a review). in this way one establishes a formula for
the black hole entropy in terms of the surface charge of the noether potential over the
horizon. when the lagrangian depends arbitrarily on the riemann tensor r (but
not on its derivatives) and on matter elds and their rst-order derivatives, one can
show that the entropy of a static black hole is given by [24, 21, 22]

smacro = 1

16 is 2

ab cd

(8l)
rabcd

,

(12)

where the epsilon tensors act in the subspace orthogonal to the horizon associated
with the time and the radial coordinates; the factor 8 is related to our normalization
conventions for the lagrangian.

with these results one can compute the macroscopic entropy of static, spherically
symmetric, n = 2 supersymmetric black hole solutions in the presence of higher-
derivative interactions. in view of the homogeneity of the function f , it is convenient
to introduce rescaled variables y i = ek/2 zx i and  = ek z 2 a. at the horizon
it then follows that the relation between the y i and the
we must have  = 64.
electric/magnetic charges of the black hole is given by y i  y i = ipi and fi(y, ) 
fi( y , ) = iqi . on the other hand, it follows from (5) that |z|2 = pifi(y, )  qiy i,
which determines the value of |z| in terms of (pi, qi). subsequently one establishes that

area law corrections from state counting and supergravity

8

the expression for the entropy takes the remarkably concise form [10],

smacro = h|z|2 + 4 im(cid:16) f(y, )(cid:17)i ,

where  = 64 .

(13)

in this formula the rst term originates from the bekenstein-hawking entropy
contribution associated with the area, whereas the second term is due to walds
modication induced by the presence of higher-derivative terms. here we point out
that this modication does not actually originate from the terms quadratic in the
weyl tensor, because the weyl tensor vanishes at the horizon, but from a term in
the lagrangian proportional to the product of the ricci tensor with the tensor eld
t ab ijtcd kl. note that when switching on higher-derivative interactions the value of |z|
changes and hence also the horizon area changes. there are thus two ways in which the
presence of higher-derivative interactions modies the black hole entropy, namely by a
change of the near-horizon geometry and by an explicit deviation from the bekenstein-
hawking area law. also note that the entropy (13) is entirely determined in terms of the
charges carried by the black hole, s = s(q, p). because of the homogeneity property of
the function f (y, ) one can show that the macroscopic entropy (13) must be an even
function of the charges.

4. an n = 2 example

let us then determine the macroscopic entropy of black hole solutions arising in type-
iia string theory compactied on a calabi-yau threefold, in the limit where the volume
of the calabi-yau threefold is taken to be large, and let us compare it with the result for
the microscopic entropy (3) obtained via state counting. the associated homogeneous
function f (y, ) is given by (with i = 0, . . . , n and a = 1, . . . , n)

f (y, ) = 

cabc y ay by c

6 y 0

c2a

y a
y 0  .

(14)

the lagrangian associated with this homogeneous function contains a term proportional
to the square of the weyl tensor with coecient c2a im za, where za = y a/y 0.
in particular, black holes carrying charges q0 and pa, only. solving the
consider,
associated stabilization equations for y i = y i(q, p) and substituting the result into
(13) yields [10]

smacro = 2q 1

6 |q0|(cabc papbpc + c2a pa) ,

(15)

in exact agreement with the microscopic entropy formula (3). thus, we see that the
entropy obtained via state counting [5, 6] is in accord with walds proposal for the
macroscopic entropy which deviates from the area law.

5. state counting for n = 4, 8 black holes

let us now nally turn to black hole solutions occuring in type-iia compactications
on k3  t 2 and on t 6 and let us discuss the associated microstate counting. in the m-
theory picture we consider then a ve-brane wrapped around a holomorphic four-cycle

area law corrections from state counting and supergravity

p in either one of these spaces. when proceeding with the counting of zero modes, as
in the calabi-yau threefold case described in [5], the left- and right-moving bosonic and
fermionic degrees of freedom are given in terms of the hodge numbers of p by:

n left
n left
n right
n right

bosonic = 2h2,0(p ) + h1,1(p ) + 2  2h1,0(p ) ,
fermionic = 4h1,0(p ) ,
bosonic = 4h2,0(p ) + 4  2h1,0(p ) ,
fermionic = 4[h2,0(p ) + h0,0(p )] .

(16)

the eective two-dimensional theory describing the collective modes of a bps black
hole is a (0, 4) supersymmetric sigma-model. therefore, the number of right-moving
bosons and fermions has to match. moreover the right-moving scalars are expected
to parametrize a quaternionic manifold and therefore the number of right-moving real
bosons should be a multiple of four.
inspection of (16) shows that in the case of a
generic calabi-yau threefold, for which h1,0(p ) = 0, the counting of right-moving modes
is consistent with (0, 4) supersymmetry, whereas this is not the case for k3  t 2 and for
t 6, for which h1,0(p ) = 1 and h1,0(p ) = 3, respectively. this implies that the zero-mode
counting for k3  t 2 and for t 6 has to deviate from the one described above.

using (16) the central charges of the left- and right-moving sector are computed to

be

cl = n left
cr = n right

bosonic + 1
bosonic + 1

2n left
2n right

fermionic = cabc papbpc + c2a pa + 4h1,0(p ) ,
fermionic = cabc papbpc + 1
2c2a pa + 4h1,0(p ) ,

which then via (2) leads to the following result for the microscopic entropy,

smicro = 2r 1

6|q0|(cid:16)cabc papbpc + c2a pa + 4h1,0(p )(cid:17) .

(17)

(18)

now we note that the sub-subleading third term in this expression proportional to h1,0
is not consistent with the macroscopic computation of the entropy based on n = 2
supergravity. as mentioned above, the entropy should be even in terms of the charges.
how is the zero-mode counting for k3  t 2 and for t 6 to be modied in order to
remove the inconsistencies mentioned above? let us recall that there are b1 = 2h1,0(p )
nondynamical gauge elds present. if we assume that the zero-modes are charged and
couple to these gauge elds, then the following mechanism suggests itself. due to
gauge invariance, the number of left- and right-moving scalar elds is reduced by b1,
so that the number of right-moving scalar elds is indeed a multiple of four. due to
supersymmetry this must be accompanied by the removal of 2b1 right-moving fermionic
real degrees of freedom. if, in addition, we assume that the removal of fermionic degrees
of freedom is left-right symmetric, then the actual number of left-moving fermionic
degrees of freedom is zero. the central charge in the left-moving sector is now computed
to be cl = cabc papbpc +c2a pa, which is odd in the charges. the resulting microscopic
entropy formula is then in full agreement with the macroscopic computation, and it is
also consistent with anomaly inow arguments [25].
