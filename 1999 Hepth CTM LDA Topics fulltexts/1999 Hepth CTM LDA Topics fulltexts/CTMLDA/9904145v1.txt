abstract

this is a set of introductory lecture notes devoted to the wess-zumino-witten
model of two-dimensional conformal eld theory. we review the construction of
the exact solution of the model from the functional integral point of view. the
boundary version of the theory is also briey discussed.

introduction

quantum eld theory is a structure at the root of our understanding of physical world
from the subnuclear scales to the astrophysical and the cosmological ones. the concept
of a quantum eld is very rich and still poorly understood although much progress have
been achieved over some 70 years of its history. the main problem is that, among
various formulations of quantum eld theory it is still the original lagrangian approach
which is by far the most insightful, but it is also the least precise way to talk about
quantum elds. the strong point of the lagrangian approach is that it is rooted in the
classical theory. as such, it permits a perturbative analysis of the eld theory in powers
of the planck constant and also captures some semi-classical non-perturbative eects
(solitons, instantons). on the other hand, however, it masks genuinely non-perturbative
eects. in the quest for a deeper understanding of quantum eld theory an important
role has been played by two dimensional models. much of what we have learned about
nonperturbative phenomena in quantum eld theory has its origin in such models. one
could cite the thirring model with its anomalous dimensions and the fermion-boson
equivalence to the sine-gordon model, the schwinger model with the connement of
electric charge, the non-linear sigma model with the non-perturbative mass generation,
and so on.

the two-dimensional models exhibiting conformal invariance have played a specially
important role. on one side, they are not without direct physical importance, de-
scribing, in their euclidean versions, the long-distance behavior of the two-dimensional

1

statistical-mechanical systems, like the ising or the potts models, at the second order
phase transitions. on the other hand, the (quantum) conformal eld theory (cft)
models constitute the essential building blocks of the classical vacua of string theory,
a candidate theory of everything, including quantum gravity. the two-dimensional
space-time plays simply the role of a string world sheet parametrizing the string evolu-
tion, similarly as the one-dimensional time axis plays the role of a world line of point
particles. the recent developments seem to indicate that string theory, or what will
eventually emerge from it, provides the appropriate language to talk about general
quantum elds, whence the central place of two-dimensional cft in the quantum eld
theory edice.

due to the innite-dimensional nature of the conformal symmetry in two space-
time dimensions, the two-dimensional models of cft lend themselves to a genuinely
non-perturbative approach based on the innite symmetries and the concept of the
operator product expansion [1]. in the present lectures, we shall discuss a specic model
of two-dimensional cft, the so called wess-zumino-(novikov)-witten model (wzw)
[2][3][4]. it is an example of a non-linear sigma model with the classical elds on the
space-time taking values in a manifold which for the wzw model is taken as a group
manifold of a compact lie group g. we shall root our treatment in the lagrangian
approach and will work slowly our way towards a non-perturbative formulation. this
will, hopefully, provide a better understanding of the emerging structure which, to a
large extent, is common to all cft models. in fact, the wzw theory is a prototype of
general (rational) cft models which may be obtained from the wzw one by dierent
variants of the so called coset construction. in view of the stringy applications, where
the perturbation expansion is built by considering two-dimensional conformal theories
on surfaces of arbitrary topology, we shall dene and study the wzw model on a
general riemann surface.

a word of warning is due to a more advanced audience. the purpose of these
notes is not to present a complete up-to-date account of the wzw theory, even less of
cft. that would largely overpass the scope of a summer-school lecture notes. as a
result, we limit ourselves to the simplest version of the model leaving completely aside
the ramications involving models with non-simply connected groups, orbifolds, etc, as
well as applications to string theory. we prot, however, from this simple example to
introduce on the way some of the main concepts of two-dimensional cft. much of the
material presented is not new, even old, by the time-scale standard of the subject, with
the possible exception of the last section devoted to the boundary wzw models. the
author still hopes that the following exposition, which he failed to present at the 1998
istanbul summer school, may be useful to a young reader starting in the eld.

the notes are organized as follows.

in sect. 2, we discuss a simple quantum-
mechanical version of the wzw model: the quantum particle on a group manifold.
this simple model, exactly solvable by harmonic analysis on the group, permits to de-
scribe many structures similar to the ones present in the two-dimensional theory and to
understand better the origin of those. sect. 3 is devoted to the denition of the action
functional of the wzw model. the action contains a topological term, which requires

2

a special treatment. we discuss separately the case of the surfaces without and with
boundary, in the latter case postponing the discussion of local boundary conditions to
the last section. in sect. 4, we introduce the basic objects of the (euclidean) quan-
tum wzw theory: the quantum amplitudes taking values in the spaces of states of the
theory and the correlation functions. we state the innite-dimensional symmetry prop-
erties of the theory related to the chiral gauge transformations and to the conformal
transformations. the symmetries give rise to the action of the two copies of the current
and virasoro algebras in the hilbert space of states of the theory constructed with
the use of the representation theory of those algebras. we discuss briey the operator
product expansions which encode the symmetry properties of the correlation functions.
sect. 5 is devoted to the relation between the wzw theory and the schrodinger picture
quantum states of the topological three-dimensional chern-simons theory. the relation
is established via the ward identities expressing the behavior of the wzw correlation
functions, coupled to external gauge eld, under the chiral gauge transformations. we
discuss the structure of the spaces of the chern-simons states, the fusion ring giving
rise to the verlinde formula for their dimensions and their hilbert-space scalar prod-
uct, as well as the knizhnik-zamolodchikov connection which permits to compare the
states for dierent complex structures. in particular, we explain how the knowledge
of the scalar product of the chern-simons states permits to obtain exact expressions
for the correlation functions of the wzw theory. in sect. 6 we give a brief account of
the coset construction of a large family of cft models which may be solved exactly,
given the exact solution of the wzw model. finally, sect. 7 is devoted to the wzw
theory with local boundary conditions. again, for the sake of simplicity, we restrict
ourselves to a simple family of the conditions that do not break the innite-dimensional
symmetries of the theory. we discuss how to dene the action functional of the model
in the presence of such boundary conditions and what are the elementary properties of
the corresponding spaces of states, quantum amplitudes and correlation functions.

2 quantum mechanics of a particle on a group

2.1 the geodesic ow on a group

non-linear sigma models describe eld theories with elds taking values in manifolds.
these lectures will be devoted to a special type of sigma models, known under the
name of wess-zumino(-novikov)-witten (or wzw) models. they are prototypes of
conformal eld theories in two-dimensional space-time. as such they play a role in string
theory whose classical solutions are built out of two-dimensional quantum conformal
eld theory models by a cohomological construction. before we plunge, however, into
the details of the wzw theory, we shall discuss a simpler but largely parallel model in
one dimension, i.e. in the domain of mechanics rather than of eld theory.

one-dimensional sigma models describe the geodesic ows on manifolds m endowed
with a riemannian or a pseudo-riemannian metric . the classical action for the

and the classical solutions s = 0 correspond to the geodesic curves in m parametrized

action of the free, non-relativistic particle of mass m undergoing linear classical motions
x(t) = x0 + p

as a gauged-xed version of the action

where the reparametrization invariance is restored by coupling the system `a la polyakov
to the metric (t)(dt)2 on the word-line of the particle. the  = 1 gauge reproduces
then the action (2.1), whereas extremizing over , one obtains the relativistic action

given by the geodesic length of the trajectory.

the exact solvability of the geodesic equations can be achieved in suciently sym-
metric situations. in particular, we shall be interested in the case when m is a manifold
of a compact lie group g and when  is a left-right invariant metric on g given by k
2
times a positive bilinear ad-invariant form tr(xy ) on the lie algebra1 g. for matrix
algebras, as the algebra su(n) of the hermitian n  n traceless matrices, the form is
given by the matrix trace in the dening representation, hence the notation. the posi-
tive constant k will play the role of a coupling constant. the action (2.1) may be then
rewritten as

s(g) =  k

the variation of the action under the innitesimal change of g vanishing on the bound-
ary is

s(g) = k

consequently, the classical trajectories are solutions of the equations

(2.2)

the case g = tn, where tn = rn/zn is the n-dimensional torus, is the prototype of
an integrable system whose trajectories are periodic or quasiperiodic motions with the

angles evolving linearly in time. the case g = so(3) corresponds to the symmetric top
whose positions are parametrized by rigid rotations. the classical trajectories solving
eq. (2.2) have a simple form:

(2.3)
where g,r are xed elements in g and  may be taken in the cartan subalgebra t  g.
for the later convenience, we have introduced the factor 1

usually, the phase space p comes equipped with the symplectic form

i d tr (p g1dg),

(2.4)

where the right hand side may be calculated at any instance of time giving a result
independent of time. the symplectic structure on p allows to associate the vector elds
xf to functions f on p by the relation df = xf , where x denotes the contraction
of a vector eld x with a dierential form . these are the hamiltonian vector elds
that preserve the symplectic form: lxf  = 0, where lx is the lie derivative that
acts on dierential forms by lx  = x d + dx . the poisson bracket of functions is
dened by: {f, g} = xf (g). in particular, the time evolution is induced by the vector
eld associated with the classical hamiltonian
k tr p2 =  k

which stays constant during the evolution. in the alternative way (2.3) to parametrize
the solutions, h = 1

and r is given by the same formula with the subscript  replaced by r.

(2.5)

there are two commuting actions of the group g on p: from the left g(t) 7 g0g(t)
and from the right g(t) 7 g(t)g1
0 . both preserve the symplectic structure and the
hamiltonian h. the vector elds corresponding to the left and right actions of the
innitesimal generators ta  g are induced by the functions

(summation convention!). the symplectic form  gives, for  xed, the canonical
symplectic form on the (co)adjoint orbit {gg1

left action of the group is g 7 g0g so that it coincides with the (co)adjoint action
on the orbit. as is well known, upon geometric quantization of the coadjoint orbits for
appropriate , this action gives rise to irreducible representations of g.



2we identify g with its dual using the bilinear form tr(xy )

2.2 the quantization
the geodesic motion on a group is easy to quantize. as the hilbert space h one takes
the space l2(g, dg) of functions on g square integrable with respect to the normalized
haar measure dg. the two commuting actions of g in h:

f 7

the irreducible representations r of the compact lie group g are nite dimen-
sional and are necessarily unitarizable so that we may assume that they act in nite-
dimensional vector spaces vr preserving their scalar product. we shall denote by gr
and xr the endomorphisms of vr representing g  g and x  g. up to isomorphism,
the irreducible representation of g may be characterized by their highest weights.
let us recall what this means. the complexied lie algebra may be decomposed into
the eigenspaces of the adjoint action of its cartan subalgebra t as

gc = tc  (

ce)

(2.6)

where [x, e] = tr (x) e for all x  t. the set of the roots   t may be divided
into the positive roots and their negatives. we shall normalize the invariant form tr on
g so that the long roots have the length squared 2 (this agrees with the normalization
of the matrix trace for g = su(n)). the step generators e may be chosen so that
[e, e] is equal to the coroot   2
tr 2 corresponding to . the elements   t
such that tr () is integer for all roots are called weights. a non-zero vector v  vr
(unique up to normalization) is called a highest weight (hw) vector if it is an eigen-
vector of the action of the cartan algebra: xrv = tr (rx) v and if (e)rv = 0 for all
positive roots . the element r of the cartan algebra, a weight, is called the highest
weight (hw) of the representation r and it determines completely r. all weights
  t such that tr () is a non-negative integer for each positive  appear as hws
of irreducible representations3 of g. the representations r may be obtained by the
geometric quantization of the (co)adjoint orbit passing through r. for the su(2) lie

3such  are usually called dominant weights

algebra spanned by the pauli matrices i, one usually takes 3 as the positive root and
2 (1  i2) as the corresponding step generators. the hws are of
the matrices  = 1
the form j3 with j = 0, 1

2 , 1, . . . called the spin of the representation.

with respect to the left-right action of g  g, the hilbert space l2(g, dg) decom-

poses as

h = r

(2.7)

r

where the (innite) sum is over the (equivalence classes of) irreducible representations
of g and r denotes the representation complex-conjugate to r, i.e. v

= gr. recall that the complex conjugate vector space v is composed of the vectors
g
v  v , denoted for distinction by v, with the multiplication by scalars dened by
v = v. a linear transformation a of v , when viewed as a transformation a of v , is
still linear. the above factorization of the hilbert space reects the classical splitting
(2.5). let (gij
r ) be the (unitary) matrix of the endomorphism gr with respect to a xed
orthonormal bases (ei

describing the time evolution of the quantum system. in the euclidean spirit, we shall
be more interested, however, in the semigroup of the thermal density matrices e h
obtained by the wick rotation of time  = it  0. their (heat) kernels are given by:

e h(g0, g1) = xr

dr e 2

k  cr r(g0g1

1 ).

in particular, at  = 0, we obtain a representation for the delta-function concentrated
at an alement g0  g:

g0(g1) = xr

dr r(g0g1

1 ).

we shall also need below the delta-functions concentrated on the conjugacy classes c.
they may be obtained by smearing the delta-function g over c :

c = xr

(2.11)

is not a normalizable state in h but it denes an antilinear functional
more exactly, c
on a dense subspace in h, e.g. the one of vectors with a nite number of components
in the decomposition (2.7).

the delta-functions c

may be used to disintegrate the haar measure dg into the

measures along the conjugacy classes and over the set of dierent conjugacy classes:

dg = 1

|t| |(e2i/k)|2 c

(g) d dg .

(2.12)

we shall choose the measure d such that it corresponds to the normalized haar measure
on the cartan group t  g under the exponential map  7 e2i/k. then

(e2i/k) = y>0

(ei tr ()/k  ei tr ()/k)

(2.13)

is the so called weyl denominator. in particular, for class functions constant on the
conjugacy classes one obtains the weyl formula:

zg

f dg = z f (e2i/k) |(e2i/k)|2 d ,

(2.14)

where each conjugacy class should be represented ones. we shall employ this represen-
tation of the integral of class functions later.

integral:

e h(g0, g1) =

es(g) dg ,

where dg stands for the product of the haar measures dg(t). the integral on the right
hand side may be given a rigorous meaning as the one with respect to the brownian
bridge measure dwg0,g1(g) supported by continuous paths in g. the path integral may

3 the wzw action

3.1 two-dimensional sigma models

the two-dimensional sigma models describe eld theories with elds mapping a surface
 to a target manifold m, both equipped with metric structures. such eld congu-
rations represent evolution of a string in the target m with  being the string world

10

sheet. the (euclidean) action functional of the eld conguration x :   m is

4 z

s(x) = 1

(x) x  x   ,

(3.1)

where  is the riemannian metric on m,  the one on  and   qdet  is the

riemannian volume density on . in particular, if m = rn with the standard metric,
we obtain the quadratic action of the free eld on a two-dimensional surface leading to
linear classical equations. the general case, however, results in a non-linear classical
theory.

the term s does not change under the local rescalings  7 e2 of the metric
on  i.e. it possesses two-dimensional conformal invariance. for oriented , conformal
classes of the metric are in one to one correspondence with complex structures on 
such that zz = z z = 0 in the holomorphic coordinates and that the latter preserve the
orientation. the action s may be written using explicitly only the complex structure
of :

s(x) = i

2 z

(x) x  x  ,

(3.2)

where  = dzz and  = dzz. one-dimensional complex manifolds are called riemann
surfaces. it follows that the action s(x) may be dened on such surfaces.

to the s term, one may add the expression

s(x) = 1

4i z

(x) x x 

(3.3)

where  =  are the coecients of a 2-form  on m. geometrically, s is
proportional to the integral of the pullback of  by x:

s(x) = 1

4i z

x .

(3.4)

the imaginary coecient is required by the unitarity of the theory after the wick
rotation to the minkowski signature. the term s does not use the metric on  but
only the orientation and is often called a topological term. hence the classical two-
dimensional conformal invariance of the model with the action s = s + s.

on the quantum level, the sigma model requires a renormalization which often

imposes the addition to the action of further terms

stach(x) = 1

2 zt (x)

and

sdil(x) = 1

2 zd(x) r  ,

(3.5)

where where t and d are functions on m called tachyonic and dilatonic potentials,
respectively, and r is the scalar curvature of the metric . the renormalization breaks
the conformal invariance (note that stach and sdil are not conformal invariant). we shall
be interested, however, in the case of the wzw model [2], an example of a cft, where
the classical conformal invariance is (almost) not broken on the quantum level.

11

the wzw model is the two-dimensional counterpart of the particle on a group and
may be thought of as describing the movement of a string on a group manifold m = g
equipped with the invariant metric  described before. we then have for g :   g,

tr (g1g)(g1 g),

where k is a positive constant. the quantization of a model with such an action leads,
however, to a theory without conformal invariance. to restore the latter, one adds to
the s term, following witten [2], a topological term, the so called wess-zumino (wz)
term sw z. in the rst approximation, sw z = ks where  is a 2-form on g such that
d is equal to the canonical 3-form   1
3 tr (g1dg)3 on g. if the group g is abelian,
such a description is indeed possible and the overall action is a simple version of the free
eld one. in the non-abelian case, however, the diculty comes from the fact that the
3-form  is closed but not globally exact so that the forms  exist only locally and are
dened only up to closed 2-forms. hence the denition of the wz term of the action
requires a more rened discussion.

3.2 particle in the eld of a magnetic monopole

it may be useful to recall a simpler situation where one is confronted with a similar
problem. suppose that we want to dene the contribution sdir(x) to the action of a
mechanical particle of the term

ez t

a(x)

dx
dt

dt = ez xa

describing the coupling to the abelian gauge eld a = adx with the eld strength
2 (a  a), or in the language of dierential forms, with f = da, where
f = 1
f = fdxdx. the constant e stands for the electric charge of the particle. for
concreteness, suppose that f corresponds to the magnetic eld of a monopole of
magnetic charge  placed at the origin of r3:

f = 1

2  

x

|x|3 .

there is no global 1-form a on r3 without the origin such that da = f . for a closed
trajectory t 7 x(t), however, we may pose

sdir(x) = ezdexf ,

ez
s2exf

12

where ex is a map of a disc d into r3 \ {0} coinciding on the boundary of the disc with
x. for two dierent extensions ex, however, the above prescription may give dierent

results. their dierence may be written as the integral

(3.7)

(3.8)

over the 2-sphere s2 obtained by gluing the two disc d, one with the inverted orien-

tation, along the boundary and for the map ex : s2  r3 \ {0} glued from the two

extensions of x to the respective discs, see fig. 2.

d

fig. 2

the ambiguities (3.8) are the periods of the closed form f over the cycles of the 2nd
integer homology h2(r3 \ {0}) = z. they take discrete values which are multiples of
4e. the latter value is obtained for the unit sphere in r3, a generator of h2(r3 \
{0}). the discrete ambiguities are acceptable in classical mechanics where one studies
the extrema of the action.
in quantum mechanics, however, we have to give sense
to the feynman amplitudes eisdir(x) , hence only the ambiguities in the action with
values in 2z are admissible. demanding that the quantum-mechanical amplitudes be
unambiguously dened reproduces this way the dirac quantization condition e  1
2 z.
for open trajectories [0, t ]  t 7 x(t), the amplitudes eier xa may not, in general,
be unambiguously assigned numerical values. they may be only dened as maps be-
tween the bers lx(0) and lx(t ) of a line bundle l. geometrically, they give the parallel
transport in the bundle corresponding to a u(1)-connection with the curvature form f .
we shall recover the analogous situation below when discussing how to give meaning
to the wz term in the action of the wzw model.

3.3 wess-zumino action on surfaces without boundary

let us rst consider the case of compact riemann surfaces without boundary.

fig. 3

13

topologically, such surfaces are characterized by the genus g equal to the number
of handles of the surface. they may be viewed as world sheets of a closed string
created from the vacuum, undergoing in the evolution g splittings and recombinations
and nally disappearing into the vacuum, see fig. 3 where a surface of genus 2 was
represented. at genus zero, there is only one (up to dieomorphisms) riemann surface,
the riemann sphere cp 1 = c  {}, see fig. 4(a).

at genus one, there is a complex one-parameter family of riemann surfaces: the complex
tori t = c/(z +  z) with  in the upper half plane h + of the complex numbers such
that im > 0, see fig. 4(b). the tori t and t , where  = a+b
d ) in the
c+d
modular group sl(2, z), may be identied by the map z 7 z = (c +d)1z. the space
of the dieomorphism classes (i.e. the moduli space) of genus one riemann surfaces
is equal to h +/sl(2, z) and has complex dimension 1. for higher genera, the moduli
spaces of riemann surfaces have complex dimension 3(g  1).

for ( a

c

b

let us return to the discussion of the action of the wzw model. assume that g
is connected and simply connected and that  is a compact riemann surface without
boundary. following [2] and mimicking the trick used for a particle in a monopole eld,

one may extend the eld g :   g to a map eg : b  g of a 3-manifold b such that

b =  and set:

is contained in the domain of denition of a 2-form  such that d = , but it makes

by the stokes formula, this expression coincides with ks(g) whenever the image of eg
sense in the general case. the price is that the result depends on the extension eg of the

eld g. the ambiguities have the form of the integrals

over 3-manifolds eb without boundary with eg : eb  g, see fig. 5.

they are proportional to the periods of the 3-form  over the integer homology h3(g).
such discrete contributions do not eect the classical equations of motion s = 0. in
quantum mechanics, however, where we deal with the feynman amplitudes4 es(g),
only ambiguities in 2iz are allowed. hence we have to nd conditions under which
the periods (3.10) lie in 2iz.

recall that we normalized the invariant form tr on the lie algebra g of g so that

the long roots in t have length squared 2. when g = su(2) = {x  r4 | |x|2 = 1},
the 3-form  equals then to 4 times the volume form of the unit 3-sphere. since the
volume of the latter is equal to 22, we infer that

1

4i zsu (2)

 = 2i .

(3.11)

for the other simple, simply connected groups, the roots  determine the sub-algebras
su(2)  g, obtained by identifying the corresponding coroot  = 2 
tr 2 and the step
generators e with the pauli matrices 3 and , respectively. by exponentiation, we
obtain the su(2) subgroups of g. clearly,

1

4i zsu (2)

 =  4i
tr 2 .

(3.12)

2

the ratio
tr 2 is equal to 1 for long roots and is a positive integer for the others. it
appears that any of the subgroups su(2) = s3 for  a long root generates h3(g) = z.
thus the unambiguous denition of the amplitudes esw z (g) requires that the coupling
constant k, called the level of the model, be a (positive) integer, in the analogy to the
dirac quantization of the magnetic charge.

it is easy to see that, although the action sw z(g) cannot be expressed, in general,

as a local integral over , the variation of s w z has such a form:

w z

s

(g) = k

4i z

tr (g1g)(g1dg)2.

(3.13)

the above formula is a special case of the general, very useful, geometric identity:

r f = r lf  , where lx is the lie derivative. applied to f = g and  =  it gives,

4there is no i in front of s since we work with the euclidean action

15

in conjunction with the stokes formula, the above relation. it is also important to note
the behavior of s w z under the point-wise multiplication of elds, a basic property of
the wz term:

w z

s

(g1g2) = s

w z

(g1) + s

w z

(g2) + w (g1, g2) ,

where

w (g1, g2) = k

4i z

tr (g1

1 dg1)(g2dg1

2 ).

(3.14)

(3.15)

the relation follows easily from the denition (3.9), again by applying the stokes for-
mula.

the complete action of the wzw model on a closed riemann surface  is the sum
of the - and the wz-terms with the same coupling constant k: s(g) = s(g)+s w z (g).
since s is unambiguous, it has the same ambiguities as sw z, requiring that k be a
(positive) integer. the relations (3.13) and (3.14) get also contributions from s and
become:

2i z

tr (g1g)(g1 g),

s(g) =  k
s(g1g2) = s(g1) + s(g2) + k

2i z

tr (g1

1

g1)(g2g1

2 ).

(3.16)

(3.17)

the last relation is often called the polyakov-wiegmann formula. from eq. (3.16), we
obtain the classical equations of motion

(g1 g) = 0

or, equivalently,

(gg1) = 0 .

(3.18)

they have few solutions with values in g (this would not be the case if we considered
 with a minkowski metric). in all the above formulae, however, we could have taken
elds g with values in the complexied group gc. for such elds, the general local
solutions of eqs. (3.18) have the form

g(z, z) = g(z) gr(z)1

(3.19)

where g (gr) are local holomorphic (anti-holomorphic) maps with values in gc. thus
eqs. (3.18) constitute a non-linear generalization of the laplace equation in two dimen-
sions whose solutions are harmonic functions which are, locally, sums of holomorphic
and anti-holomorphic ones. in particular, multiplying a solution (3.19) by a holomor-
phic map into gc on the left and by an anti-holomorphic one on the right we obtain
another solution. similarly, composing a solution with a local holomorphic map or
inverting it in gc after composition with a local anti-holomorphic map of  one pro-
duces new solutions. hence a rich symmetry structure of the classical theory. this
structure will be preserved by the quantization leading to the current and virasoro
algebra symmetries of the quantum wzw model.

16

3.4 wess-zumino action on surfaces with boundary

what if the surface  has a boundary? of course only the wz term in the action
causes problems due to its non-local character. the term s is dened unambiguously
for any compact surface. it will be convenient to represent  as  \ (n
n) where dn
are disjoint unit discs { z | |z|  1} embedded in a closed surface  without boundary,
see fig.6.

d

fig. 6

note that the boundaries of  are then naturally parametrized by the unit circles. one
way to proceed in the presence of boundaries is to extend the eld g :   g to a map
(g) pertaining to the surface , as stressed
g :   g and to consider the action sw z
by a subscript. we are again confronted with the question as to how the action on 
depends on the extension of the eld. the answer is easy to work out. if g = gh is
another extension of g then, by eq. (3.14),



s

w z

 (g) = s

w z

 (g) + s

w z

 (h) + w(g, h) .

(3.20)

it will be convenient to localize the changes in the discs dn by rewriting the last formula
as

s

w z

 (g) = s

w z

 (g) +xn (cid:16)s

w z

s2 (hn) + wdn

(g, h)(cid:17) ,

(3.21)

where hn, mapping spheres (compactied planes) s2
by
unity and wdn
are as in eq. (3.15) but with the integration restricted to dn. to account
for the change (3.21), we shall dene the following equivalence relation between the pairs
(g, z) where g : d  g and z  c:

n to g, extend the maps h|dn

(g, z)  (gh, z esw z

s2 (h)wd (g,h))

for h : s2  g equal to unity outside the unit disc d  s2. the set of equivalence
classes forms a complex line bundle l over the loop group lg of the boundary values of
the maps g. comparing to eq. (3.21), we infer that for g :   g with  as above, the
amplitude esw z
 (g) makes sense as the element of a tensor product of the line bundles
l, one for each boundary component of ,

esw z

 (g)  n lg|

,

dn

17

where lh denotes the ber of l over the loop h  lg. hence the wz amplitudes
esw z
 (g) take values in line bundles instead of having numerical values, exactly as for
the amplitudes giving the parallel transport in a u(1)-gauge eld mentioned before.

the line bundle l is an interesting object. it carries a hermitian structure given
by the absolute value of z. the bers of l over g and g where g ia a reversed loop,
g(ei) = g(ei), may be naturally paired so that, for g : e  g, where e is obtained
from two surfaces  and  by gluing them along some boundary components, see
fig. 7,

(g| ) i = es

(3.22)







fig. 7

l may be also equipped with a product structure such that
es (g1)  es (g2) = es (g1g2) ew (g1,g2) ,

(3.23)

compare to eq. (3.14). under the product, the elements of unit length in l form a
group bg which is a central extension of the loop group lg by the circle group u(1):

1  u(1)  bg  lg  1 .

the second arrow sends ei to the equivalence class of (1, ei). the extensions for k > 1
are powers of the universal one corresponding to k = 1. on the innitesimal level, one
obtains the central extensions of the loop algebra lg of the maps of the circle s1 to the
lie algebra g by the real line:

(3.24)

(3.25)

0  r  bg  lg  0 .

the lie algebra bg, called the current or the ane kac-moody algebra, may be de-

scribed explicitly in terms of the complexied generators ta
taein in lgc and the central element k satisfying the commutation relations:

n corresponding to the loops

[ta
n, tb

m] = if abc tc

n+m + 1

2 k n abn+m,0 .

(3.26)

18

the algebra bg is the same for all levels k but the central element k  bg is the image of
k  r under the second arrow in the exact sequences (3.25). note that the generators
0 span a subalgebra g  bg. as we shall see, the group bg and the algebra bg play in the
ta
wzw theory a similar role to that of g and g for the particle on the group.

3.5 coupling to gauge eld
we may couple the wzw model to the gauge eld ia  i(a10 + a01), a 1-form with
values in the lie algebra g (or, more generally, gc), where a10 = ta aa
zdz and a01 =
ta aa
zdz are, respectively, a 1,0- and a 0,1-form (the chiral components of the gauge eld).
in most what follows, we shall treat the gauge eld as external, i.e. non-dynamical.
nevertheless, the coupling will allow to test the variation of the quantum system under
the changes of the gauge eld background and, nally, will facilitate the exact solution
of the model. for a surface without boundary, we dene

s(g, a) = s(g) + ik

2 z

tr [a10(g1 g) + (gg1) a01 + ga10g1a01] .

(3.27)

under the local gauge transformations h :   g, the gauge elds transform in the
standard way:

a10 7 ha10 = ha10 h1 + hh1 ,

a01 7 ha01 = ha01h1 + h h1 .

the reaction of the action to the chiral changes of the gauge is encoded in the identity

s(g, a) = s(h1gh1

2 , h2a10 + h1a01) + s(h2, a10) + s(h1

1 , a01)

(3.28)

which follows in a direct manner from the polyakov-wiegmann formula (3.17). for
the later convenience, we have chosen a modied way of coupling to the gauge eld,
as compared to the more standard way with the addition of the term a10a01 in
the brackets on the right hand side of eq. (3.27). the latter way would render the
action invariant with respect to the diagonal (i.e. non-chiral) gauge transformations
with h1 = h2.

for surfaces with boundary, we dene es(g,a) by the same prescription but on the
level of the amplitudes with values in the product of line bundles. the denition (3.23)
of the product implies then the transformation rule:

es(g,a) = es(h1

1 ,a01)  es(h1g h1

2 ,

h2a10 +

h1a01)  es(h2,a10)

(3.29)

which extends the property (3.28) to the case with boundaries.

4 quantization of the wzw model

4.1 quantum amplitudes

the feynman quantization prescription instructs us that in the quantum wzw model
we should sum the amplitudes of dierent classical congurations. this leads to formal

19

functional integrals such as, for example,

a = z es(g) dg ,

where one integrates over the maps g :   g and dg stands for the local product
qdg() of the haar measures. if  is closed, then the above integral should take a
numerical value z called the partition function (because of the statistical physics
analogy). for  with boundary, it should dene, instead, a hilbert space state. let
(l) denote the space of sections of the line bundle l over the loop group lg. (l)
plays the role of the space of states of the quantized theory. if  has a boundary, we
should x in the functional integration the boundary values g = (gn) of elds g :   g:

a(g) =

z

g|dn

= gn

es(g) dg .

(l)
the result, in its dependence on g, should give an element of the tensor product n
of the state spaces: the quantum amplitude corresponding to the surface . more
generally, we shall consider the quantum amplitudes in the presence of external gauge
eld:

a(g; a)  =

z

g|dn

= gn

es(g,a) dg

(4.1)

again with the values in n
(l). we would like to give a rigorous meaning to such
objects. in general, the functional integrals require complicated renormalization proce-
dures which, besides, work only in some cases (of the so called renormalizable theories)
and even then, in most instances, have been implemented only on the level of formal
perturbation series. the wzw models are perturbatively renormalizable. in this case,
however, one may follow a shortcut by exploiting formal symmetry properties of the
functional integrals and showing that they x uniquely the quantum amplitudes. this
will be the line of thought adopted below, although we shall only describe the essential
points of the argument and make detours to introduce other important notions.

let us start by discussing the formal structure of the space of states (l). the

scalar product and the bilinear form

(, ) = zlg

((g), (g)) dg ,

h, i = zlgh(g), (g)i dg ,

(4.2)

which employ the hermitian structure and the duality (3.22) on the line bundle l,
should turn (l) into a hilbert space h and should allow the identication of h with
its dual. the space (l) carries also two commuting actions of the group bg :  7 bh
and  7 bh . they are dened by:
bh
(g) = bh  (h1g)

where g and h are elements of the loup group lg and h is the projection of bh  bg.
formally, these actions preserve the scalar product and the bilinear form in (l). on

(4.3)

bh

(g) = (gh) bh1 ,

20

innitesimal level, they give rise to two commuting actions of the current algebra bg in
(l). we shall denote by j a
n the operators in (l) corresponding to the left
and right action of the generators ta
n of bg. the central generator k acts in (l) as
multiplication by k. of course, j a

n satisfy the commutation relation (3.26).

n and ej a

as stressed by segal in [5], there are two important properties of the quantum
amplitudes a which are crucial for their rigorous construction. the rst one, is the
gluing property

n and ej a

(gn, gn) = z ha(gn, gn0), a (gn0, gn)i dgn0

(4.4)

which states that for a surface e glued along boundary components of two pieces  and
, as in fig. 7, the functional integral may be computed iteratively, by rst keeping the
values of g xed on the gluing circle and integrating over them only after the integration
over the elds on  and , see eq. (3.22). using the bilinear form on (l) applied to
the glued channel, we may write this relation as the identity

ae

= ha , a i .

(4.5)

it is often more convenient to view the quantum amplitudes a as operators from
the tensor product of some of the boundary spaces h into the others. this is always
possible because of the linear isomorphism between h and its dual. then eq. (4.5)
may be simply rewritten with the use of the product of operators:

= a a .

(4.6)

one may also glue two boundary components in a single connected surface . the

amplitude for the resulting surface e is then obtained from that of  by pairing the

two corresponding factors in the product of the hilbert spaces or, in the operator
interpretation, by the partial trace applied to the glued channel:

ae

ae

ae

= trh a .

(4.7)

in fact, as pointed out in [5], the last relation encompasses also the previous one if one
introduces the amplitudes for the disconnected riemann surfaces dening them as the
tensor product of the amplitudes of the components. clearly, similar gluing relation
should hold for the amplitudes in external gauge eld.

the second important property of the quantum amplitudes follows formally from
the transformation property (3.29) of the classical amplitudes under the chiral gauge
transformations h1,2 :   g. it reads:

bh1a(a)bh2 = a(h2a10 + h1a01)

(4.8)

1 = es (h1

for bh1

1 ,a01) and bh2 = es (h2,a10) . the identity (4.8) expresses the covari-

ance of the quantum amplitudes under the chiral gauge transformations. it is at the
basis of the rich symmetry structure of the quantized wzw theory.

21

where k, a non-negative integer called the level, is the value taken in the representation

4.2 the spectrum
to give a rigorous construction of the hilbert space h of the wzw model, whose
vectors represent quantum states of a closed string moving on the group manifold, one
may resort to the representation theory of the current algebras. the algebra bg possesses
a distinguished family of irreducible unitary representations labeled by pairs br = (k, r),
by the central generator k of bg and where r is an irreducible representation of g
(and of g). the irreducible unitary representations br act in spaces v
possessing a
br
(unique) subspace vr  v
n with n > 0 and carrying
the irreducible representation r of the subalgebra g  bg generated by ta
0. they are
characterized by this property. not all irreducible representations r of g appear for
the xed level k but only the ones corresponding to the the so called integrable hws
which satisfy the condition

annihilated by all the generators ta

br

tr (r)  k ,

(4.9)

where  =  is the highest root of g, i.e. such a root that  +  is not a root for any

positive root . given k, there is only a nite number of integrable hws. for dsu(2),

2, 1, . . . , k

is canonically isomorphic to v

2 . if r satises the condition
. the scalar

the integrable hws correspond to spins j = 0, 1
(4.9) then so does 
product on v

and the space v

r

may then be viewed as a bilinear pairing between v

and v

.

br

the rigorous denition of the hilbert space of states h for the wzw model of level

k makes the two notions of the level coincide:

h =

where the symbol (. . .) stands for the hilbert space completion. this is the loop group
analogue of the decomposition (2.7) of l2(g, dg). the operators j a
n representing
the action of the generators ta
satisfy the unitarity conditions
n = j a
j a
n. it is not dicult to motivate the above choice of the hilbert
space. one may, indeed, realize the space (4.10) as a space of sections of l. formally,
this may be done by the assignment (compare to the relation (2.8))

where the normalization constant  will be xed later. the functional integral on the
right hand side, as a function of g|d = h is the corresponding section of l. one may
argue that the above integral is given, up to normalization, by its semi-classical value,

(gcl)ij

r (0) esd (gcl)

(4.12)

where gcl : d  gc is the solution of the classical equations (3.18) with the boundary
condition gcl|d = h. as shown in [6], the expression (4.12) denes a non-singular
section of l only if the hw of r is integrable at level k (recall that the action s(gcl) is

22

proportional to k). one obtains then a rigorous embedding of the space br vrvr into
(l), and, identifying the actions of the current algebra bg in (l) and in br vbr  vbr
,
also of the latter space. the formal scalar product and the formal bilinear form (4.2)
on (l) correspond to the scalar product and the bilinear form on h induced by the
and
scalar product on the representation spaces v

and the bilinear pairing between v

v

(the latter induces the pairing between the br and br summands in h).
br
the action of the pair of the current algebras in h leads to the (projective) action in
h of the algebra of conformal symmetries. let us discuss how this occurs. the spaces
vbr of the irreducible unitary representations br of bg appear to carry also the unitary
representations of the virasoro algebra v ir, the central extension of the algebra of
the vector elds v ect(s1) on the circle,

br

br

0  r  v ir  v ect(s1)  0 .

(4.13)

the complex generators n of v ir corresponding to the vector elds iein satisfy the
commutation relations

[n, m] = (n  m)n+m + 1

12 c (n3  n)n+m,0 ,

(4.14)

v

where c is the central generator, the image of 1 under the second arrow in the exact
sequence (4.13). the action of the generators n in the spaces of the representations

br  v

br of bg gives rise to the set of operators ln and eln acting in the space of states
. they implement a projective action of v ect(s1)  v ect(s1), the lie
br
algebra of minkowskian conformal transformations. v ect(s1)  v ect(s1) is, indeed,
the lie algebra of the innitesimal transformations preserving the conformal class of the
minkowski metric dx2 dt2 = dx+dx, where x = x t are the light-cone coordinates
on the cylinder with periodic space-coordinate x.

the central charge c entering the commutation relations of the virasoro generators
is an important characteristic of a conformal eld theory. it appears also in the rigorous
version of the quantum amplitudes a. it enters into them in a somewhat subtle way,
measuring their change under the local rescalings  7 e2 of the metric of  (recall
that the amplitudes of the classical congurations es(g) were invariant under such
rescalings). under the change  7 e2 with  vanishing around the boundary,

due to renormalization eects, with  depending on the renormalization prescription.
we shall use the prescription corresponding to  = 0. the same transformation rule
is obeyed by the amplitudes a(a) in external gauge eld. hence, the quantum am-
plitudes are only projectively invariant under the conformal rescalings of the metric .
this is an example of the standard eect leading to projective actions of symmetries in
quantum theory. due to this eect, some care will have to be taken when making sense
out of formal properties of the quantum amplitudes, like the gluing property (4.4). we
shall always assume that the metric  of , which, together with the orientation of ,
denes its complex structure, is of the special form around the boundary. namely, that,
in terms of the complex coordinate of the unit discs dn holomorphically embedded into
the surface  without boundary such that  = \(n
n), it is equal to the cylindrical
metric |z|2|dz|2. upon gluing of surfaces along boundary components, such metrics
will automatically give smooth metrics on the resulting surfaces.

in particular, the metrics on the unit discs d will have the form e2|dz|2 with
 =  ln|z| around the boundary of d. unless otherwise stated, we shall also assume
that  = 0 around the center of d. consider the riemann sphere cp 1 = c  {}

antees that the change of  under the rescalings of the metric on d will cancel the

change of the functional integral r gij

r es(g) dg.

4.3 correlation functions

the formalism of green functions encoding the action of eld operators constitutes a
traditional tool in quantum eld theory. in the minkowski space, the green functions
allow to express easily the scattering matrix elements (at least for the massive theories,
via the lsz formalism) whereas in the euclidean space they coincide with correlation
functions of continuum statistical models, providing a bridge between quantum eld
theory and statistical mechanics.
in the context of cft, the correlation functions
dened on a general riemann surface  without boundary constitute a somewhat easier
objects to deal with than the quantum amplitudes a for surfaces with boundary.
besides, even considered on the simplest riemann surface, the riemann sphere cp 1,
they already contain the full information about the model. formally, the correlation
functions of the wzw model are given by the functional integrals

< yn

(n) > (a) = z(a)1z yn

(4.19)

where n are disjoint points in a riemann surface  without boundary. for the riemann
surface without boundary  obtained by gluing unit discs dn to a surface  with
boundary5, see fig. 6, and for the points n placed at the centers of the discs dn,
the correlation functions without the gauge eld may be expressed, with the use of
the assignment (4.11) and of the gluing property (4.5), by the scalar products of the
quantum amplitudes a with special vectors in the hilbert space of states:

< yn

(n

the normalization factor is given by the partition function of the surface with boundary
 dened by

z = z yn

n

(4.20)

with n as in eq. (4.18). the combination of the partition functions on the right hand
side does not change under local rescalings of the metric inside the discs dn.

on the level of correlation functions, the symmetry properties of the theory are
encoded in the so called ward identities. for example, the behavior (3.28) of the action

5the metric  on  is assumed to come from metrics on  and on the discs dn of the type described

these are the ward identities expressing the symmetry of the correlation functions
under the chiral gauge transformations.

it is useful and customary to introduce more general correlation functions with in-
sertions of currents testing the reaction of the functions (4.19) to innitesimal changes
of the gauge elds. on the surface  they are dened by

the action of the virasoro generators may be interpreted similarly in terms of the

their variation under the changes of the metric on the surface:

(4.28)

under the local rescaling of the metric  7 e2 with  vanishing around the insertion
points n, the correlation functions (4.19) are invariant. this is not any more the case for
general  due to (the wave function) renormalization of the insertions. for general ,
(n), where
the correlation functions pick up the product of local factors equal to e2rn
the conformal dimension r of the elds gr() coincide with the lowest eigenvalues
of the virasoro generator l0 in the hw representations of the current algebra discussed

27

before. the partition functions transform under the metric rescaling according to the
rule (4.17). the innitesimal versions of the above transformation properties together
with the covariance of the whole scheme under innitesimal dieomorphisms of the

surface  may be shown to imply that the insertions of t (zm) (et (zm)) are analytic
(anti-analytic)7 in zm for zm 6= 0 with the singular part given by the operator product
expansion

the latter expansions state that gr() are primary elds of the virasoro algebra. the

the ward identities of the chiral gauge symmetry together with the transformation

the operator expansion algebra of the insertions into the correlation functions sub-
stitutes then for the operator commutation relations but allows to encode also more
complicated algebraic relations between the cft operators, see the last section. it is
the basic technique of two-dimensional cft.

as we have discussed before, the action of the virasoro generators in the space of
states of the wzw model may be expressed in terms of the current algebra action, see
eq. (4.15). this relation may be translated into the language of the insertions into the
correlation functions, giving rise to the sugawara construction of the energy-momentum
tensor:

5 chiral wzw theory and the chern-simons states

as we have seen, the whole information about the quantum amplitudes of the wzw
theory resides in the correlation functions (4.19) in an external gauge eld. we shall
look now more closely into the gauge-eld dependence of these functions. by (formal)
analytic continuation, the chiral ward identities (4.21) and (4.22) should also hold
for the complexied gauge elds a with values in gc and for the complexied gauge
transformations h with values in gc. as we shall see, they give a powerful tool for
analysis of the correlation functions.

29

let us consider rst the ward identity (4.21). the holomorphic maps  on the space

a01 of gc-valued 0,1-gauge elds a01 with values in n

vrn satisfying the equation

(a01) = es(h1,a01) n

h1

rn

(n) (ha01)

(5.1)

for h in the group gc of gc-valued gauge transformations have an interesting geometric
interpretation. on one side, they may be viewed as holomorphic sections of a vector
vrn over the orbit space8 n = a01/gc. mathemati-
bundle w with typical ber n
cally, the orbit space n is the moduli space of the holomorphic gc-bundles and the
mathematicians like to view s as non-abelian generalizations of the classical theta
functions. indeed, the latter are holomorphic sections of a line bundle over the moduli
space (the jacobian) of the holomorhic c-bundles over a riemann surface.

5.1 states of the chern-simons theory

physically, the holomorphic maps  satisfying the ward identity (5.1) may be identied
as the quantum states of the three-dimensional chern-simons (cs) gauge theory [7].
the classical phase space of the cs theory on the 3-manifold   r is composed of
the at g-valued gauge elds ia on  modulo g-valued gauge transformations. the
atness condition is

f (a)  da + a2 = 0 .

(5.2)

in the holomorphic quantization `a la bargmann, the quantum states of the theory
are described as holomorphic functionals  on the space a01 with the condition (5.2)
imposed as a quantum constraint:

f (a) (a01) = 0 ,

(5.3)

with f (a) as in eq. (5.2) but with a01 acting as the multiplication operator and a10
as the dierentiation: aa
. the constraint (5.3) is closely related to the
innitesimal ward identity:

z =  2

k

z

(f (a) + 4i

k xn

rn

) (a) = 0

(5.4)

obtained by expanding the global ward identity (5.1) to the rst order in h around 1.
the innitesimal identity (5.4) is equivalent to its global version (5.1). in the absence
of insertions, it coincides with eq. (5.3). the modications involving the insertions
correspond in the cs gauge theory language to the insertions of the wilson lines {n}r
in representations rn.

it is a crucial fact that the (k-dependent) spaces w(, r) of the holomorphic maps
s satisfying the ward identities (5.1) or (5.4) are nite-dimensional, with the dimen-
sion given by the celebrated verlinde formula [8]. in particular, only representations

8this space requires a careful denition with a special treatment of bad orbits

30

rn with hws rn integrable at level k may give rise to non-trivial spaces w(, r).
it is instructive to look more carefully into the case of the riemann sphere cp 1. on
cp 1 all gauge elds a01 may be written in the form h1 h or may be approximated
by the elds of this form. in other words, the gauge orbit of a01 = 0 is dense in a01.
but by eq. (5.1),

(h1 h) = es(h) n

h1

rn

(n) (0) ,

(5.5)

where (0)  n
vrn is an element of a nite-dimensional space. hence (0) determines
 on a dense set of gauge elds a, so everywhere. in fact, (0) belongs to the subspace
vrn )g of tensors invariant under the diagonal action of g, as is easy to see by taking
(n
constant h in eq. (5.5). we obtain then a natural embedding

w

cp 1 (, r)  (n

vrn )

g

.

(5.6)

the images of w
cp 1 (, r) in the spaces of invariant tensors are, in general, proper
vrn )g depending on k. the reason is that the s dened by eq. (5.5)
subspaces of (n
on a01 = h1 h do not extend holomorphically to all of a01 for all invariant tensors
(0). in particular, the image of w
cp 1 (, r), which is zero if some of hws rn are
not integrable at level k, becomes the whole space of invariant tensors for suciently
large k.

for genus one, i.e. on the complex tori t = c/(z +  z), a dense set of gauge elds

is formed by the gauge orbits of the elds

a01

u = 

im u dz

with u in the complexied cartan algebra tc  gc. it is then enough to know the cs
states  only on the gauge elds a01
u . in particular, in the case with no insertions, the
holomorphic functions  dened by

(u) = e  k

2 im  tr u2

(a01
u )

characterize completely the cs states .

it appears that the functions (u) are arbitrary combinations of the characters

(, e2iu) of the hw representations of the current algebra bg, see eq. (4.16). this

br
fact implies an important property of the latter. recall that the tori t and t  for
 =  1
 may be identied by the map z 7 z = z/ . under this identication,
(, e2iu) of the

5.2 verlinde dimensions and the fusion ring

the dimensions cnr of the spaces w(, r) are independent of the complex structure

of  and the locations  of the insertion points (but dependent on the level k of the
theory suppressed in the notation). they are given by the verlinde formula which, in the
present context, is a natural generalization of the classical formula for the dimensions
nr of the spaces (vrn )g of group g invariant tensors. the dimensions nr may be
computed from the characters of the representations rn:

nr = zgyn

rn (g) dg = z yn

rn (e2i/k) |(e2i/k)|2 d ,

(5.9)

where we have used the relation (2.14). for simple, simply connected groups, the last
integral may be taken over the symplex

k = {   t | tr ()  0 for  > 0, tr ()  k }

(5.10)

r r1r2

coincide with the dimensions n r2

whose elements label the conjugacy classes classes c in a one to one way. note that the
weights in the symplex k are exactly the hws integrable at level k, see the denition
of the multiplicity
(4.9). the numbers n
spaces in the decomposition (2.18) of the tensor product of representations, i.e. with
the structure constants of the character ring rg of the group g, see eq. (2.19). for
example for the su(2) group, n j2
= 1 if |j  j1|  j2  j + j1 and j + j1 + j2 is an
j j1
integer and n j2
= 0 otherwise. the ring rg comes with an additive z-valued form 
given by the integral over g.  assigns to the combination p niri
j j1
of characters the
coecient of the character 1 = 1 of the trivial representation r = 1. the dimensions
nr are the values of  on the product of the characters rn in rg.

progress towards the solution of the wzw theory. fortunately, there exist eective
ways to determine the coecients h .

5.4 scalar product of the chern-simons states

it was argued in [9], see also [10] for a formal functional integral argument, that the
matrices (h ) appearing in eq. (5.15) are inverse to the matrices (h) with matrix
elements

h = (,  )

given by the scalar product of the cs states. according to the rules of holomorphic
quantization, the latter is given by the functional integral

(, ) = z

((a01), (a01))v

rn

e k

2 kak2

da

(5.17)

over the g-valued gauge elds ia = i((a01) + a01) with kak2  ir tr (a01) a01.

this is again a formal expression. the point is, however, that the da-integral may be
calculated exactly by reducing it to doable gaussian (i.e. free eld) functional integrals.
ones this is done, the exact solution for the correlation functions follows by eq. (5.15).
note that the above solution for coecients h  guarantees that the right hand side of
eq. (5.15) is independent of the choice of a basis of the cs states. let us briey sketch
how one achieves the reduction of the integral (5.17) to the free eld ones.

in the rst step, the integral (5.17) may be rewritten by a trick resembling the
faddeev-popov treatment of gauge theory functional integrals. the reparametrization
of the gauge elds

permits to rewrite the functional integral expression for the norm squared of a cs state
in the new variables as

kk2 = z ((a01(n),(hh)1

rn

(a01(n))v

rn

e(k+2h)s(hh,a01(n)) d(hh) d(n). (5.19)

to obtain the expression on the right hand side, we have used eq. (5.1). the term
2h s(hh) in the action comes from the jacobian of the change of variables (5.18)
contributing also to the measure d(n) on the local slice in a01.

unlike in the standard faddeev-popov setup, the integral over the group of gauge
transformations did not drop out since the integrand in eq. (5.17) is invariant only
under the g-valued gauge transformations.
instead, we are left with a functional
integral (5.19) similar to the one for the original correlation functions, see eq. (4.19),
except that it is over elds hh . these elds may be considered as taking values in
the contractible hyperbolic space gc/g. d(hh) is the formal product of the gc-
invariant measures on gc/g. the gain is that the functional integral (5.19) for the
hyperbolic wzw model correlation functions is doable. for example for g = su(2)
and for  = cp 1, where we may set a01(n) = 0 (in this case the gauge orbit of a01 = 0
gives already a dense open subset a01),

boloid sl(2, c)/su(2) by   r and v  c, with u  su(2). although the action
is not quadratic in the elds, it is quadratic in the complex eld v so that the v integral
can be explicitly computed. somewhat miraculously, the resulting integral appears to
depend on the remaining eld  again in a gaussian way so that the integration may
be carried out further. the same happens for more complicated groups and on surfaces
with handles, except that the procedure requires more steps. at the end, one obtains
explicit nite-dimensional integrals. hence, the integral (5.19) belongs to the class of
functional integrals that may be explicitly evaluated. the gaussian functional inte-
grals encountered in its computation require mild renormalizations (the zeta-function

35

or similar regularization of determinants, wick ordering of insertions) but these are well
understood. they are responsible for the mild non-invariance of the wzw correlation
functions under the local rescalings of the metric, leading to the values of the virasoro
central charge and of the conformal dimensions discussed above.

on the complex tori t with no insertions and in the constant metric |dz|2, the
scalar product of the cs states takes a particularly simple form: the current algebra
(, ) appear to give an orthonormal basis of the space of states. it follows
characters 
that the toroidal partition function in the constant metric is

br

z( ) = x
br

br

(, 1)|2 ,

(5.20)

see eq. (5.16). the exact normalization of the constant metric on t is not important
since at genus one constant rescalings of the metric, exceptionally, do not eect the
partition functions. the latter fact has an important consequence. it implies that the
partition function z( ) has to be a modular invariant:

z( ) = z( a +b
c +d )

b

c

d )  sl(2, z). this is indeed the property of the right hand side of eq. (5.20)
for ( a
since the matrices implementing the modular transformations on the characters of the
current algebra are unitary.

explicit nite-dimensional integral formulae for the scalar product (5.17) have been
obtained for general groups at genus zero and one and, for g = su(2), for higher
genera. it is clear that the case of general group and genus >1 could be treated along
the same lines, but the explicit calculation has not been done. it should be also said
that the general proof of the convergence of the resulting nite-dimensional integrals is
also missing, although several special cases have been settled completely.

5.5 case of g = su (2) at genus zero

to give a feeling about the form of the explicit expressions for the scalar product of
the cs states, let as describe the result for g = su(2) and  = cp 1 with insertions
at points zn in the standard complex coordinate z. in this case, as we have discussed
vjn )su (2) , where we label
above, the cs states correspond to invariant tensors v in (n
the irreducible representations of su(2) by spins. the spin j representation acts in
the space vj spanned by the vectors ()
is the
normalized hw vector annihilated by (+)j , with i denoting the pauli matrices. for
the scalar product of the cs states, the procedure described in the previous subsection
gives the following integral expression:

j vj with  = 0, 1, . . . , 2j , where vj

carries the dependence on the metric e2|dz|2 on cp 1, with det() denoting the
zeta-function regularized determinant of the (minus) laplacian on cp 1 with omission of
4ir  
the zero eigenvalue. the -dependence of (det()/area) is given by a term e
leading altogether to the value 3k
k+2 of the virasoro central charge of the wzw theory
(recall that this is the inverse of the scalar product that enters the wzw correlation
functions). similarly, the conformal weight j of the elds gj() of the su(2) wzw
theory may be read from eq. (5.22) to be j(j+1)
k+2 . next, (z, y) is a meromorphic

finally, u(z, y) is a multivalued function

u(z, y) = xn<m

jnjm ln(zn  zm)  xn,r

jn ln(zn  yr) + xr<s

ln(yr  ys) .

(5.24)

the integral (5.21) is over a positive density with singularities at the coinciding yr s
and the question arises as to whether it converges. a natural conjecture states that the
integral is convergent if and only if the invariant tensor v is in the image of the space
of states w(cp 1, z, j) explicitly described as the set of v  (n

vjn )su2 such that

(vjn , yn

for x pn  j  k  1.

(5.25)

in particular, for two or three points, the image does not depend on the location of

the insertions and gives the whole space of invariant tensors if p jn  k and zero

otherwise. in this case, the integrals in eq. (5.21) may indeed be computed in a closed
form conrming the conjecture. numerous other special cases have been checked. in
general, the only if part of the conjecture is easy but the if part remains to be
veried.

5.6 knizhnik-zamolodchikov connection

there is another way to construct the matrices (h ) entering the formula (5.15) for
the correlation functions. let us describe it briey.

the spaces w(, r) of the cs states depend on the complex structure of the surface
 and on the insertion points. they form, in a natural way, a holomorphic vector bundle
w whose base is the space of complex structures on a given smooth surface  and of
non-coinciding insertions  (modulo dieomorphisms). the scalar product of the cs
states equips this bundle with a hermitian structure. in turn, a hermitian structure on

37

a holomorphic vector bundle determines a unique connection such that the covariant
derivatives of the structure and of the holomorphic sections vanish. although the scalar
product of the cs states has been rigorously dened in the general case only modulo
the convergence of nite-dimensional integrals (see the end of the last subsection), the
connection on the bundle of the states may be easily constructed with full mathematical
rigor. it appears to be projectively at (i.e. with a curvature that is a scalar 2-form
on the base space), a crucial fact. in other words, the parallel transport of a cs state
around a closed loop in the space of complex structures and insertions at most changes
its normalization.

for the genus zero case, there is only one complex structure modulo dieomorphisms.
if we x it as the standard complex structure on cp 1, then we are only left with the
freedom to move the insertion points z. the bundle w is in this case a subbundle of
vrn )g and
the trivial bundle with the ber formed by the invariant group tensors (n
the connection may be extended to this trivial bundle. the covariant derivatives of the
sections of the latter are given explicitly by the equations:

zn v = zn v ,

zn v = zn v + 2

k+h xm6=n

ta
ta
rn
rm
zmzn

v

(5.26)

which go back to the work [3] of knizhnik-zamolodchikov on the wzw theory. in fact
the above connection is at as long as the insertion points stay away from innity and
the article [3] studied their horizontal sections such that v = 0. the higher genus
generalizations of these equations were rst considered by bernard [11][12] and we shall
call the connection on the bundle w the knizhnik-zamolodchikov (kz) connection for
genus zero or the knizhnik-zamolodchikov-bernard (kzb) one for higher genera.

in general, the kzb connection can be made at by some choices (as in the case of
genus zero, where the curvature has been concentrated at innity). for a at connec-
tion, one may choose locally a basis () of horizontal sections. the gain from such a
choice of the basis of the cs states is that the coecients h  in eq. (5.15) become then
independent of the complex structure or the positions of the insertions. indeed, since
h = (, ) and the kzb connection preserves the scalar product of the states,
the above scalar products are constant for horizontal . since the horizontal sec-
tions are, in particular, holomorphic, eq. (5.15) gives then a holomorphic factorization
of the correlation functions into sesqui-linear combinations of the conformal blocks
holomorphic in their dependence on the complex structure and positions of insertions.
such a nite factorization is the characteristic feature of rational cfts. as we see,
the conformal blocks of the wzw theory are given by the horizontal sections  of
the bundle w of the cs states. for example, at genus zero with no insertions, the
conformal blocks are formed by the characters of the current algebra and eq. (5.20)
provides a particular realization of the holomorphic factorization.

since the kzb connection, although at, has nevertheless a non-trivial holonomy,
the conformal blocks are, in general, multivalued. the coecients h  in eq. (5.15)
may then be xed, up to normalization, by demanding that the correlation functions be
uni-valued. the overall normalization may be xed, in turn, by considering the limits

38

2 eld g 1

when the insertion points coincide. this was the strategy used in the original work
() of the su(2)
[3] to compute the 4-point correlation function of the spin 1
wzw model on the riemann sphere. the horizontality relations for the conformal
blocks reduce in this case to the hypergeometric equation and the calculations of the
conformal blocks and of their monodromy are easy to perform. for general genus-zero
conformal blocks, one obtains generalizations of the hypergeometric equation whose
solutions may be expressed by contour integrals [13][14]. the latter are, essentially, the
holomorphic versions of the integrals (5.21) so that the two strategies to obtain explicit
solutions for the correlation functions, one based on the study of the monodromy of the
conformal blocks and the other one involving a calculation of the scalar product of the
cs states, are closely related.

2

there appears to be a very rich structure behind the connection (5.26) and its gen-
eralizations. it is closely related to the integrable systems of mechanics and statistical
mechanics, see e.g. [21][22]. the holonomy of the connection gives representations of the
braid groups which played an important role in the construction of the jones-witten
invariants of knots and 3-manifold invariants [7]. the perturbative solutions of the
horizontality equations enter the vasiliev invariants of knots [23]. the kz connection
is also closely connected to quantum groups [24] and to drinfelds quasi-hopf algebras
[25], to mention only some interrelated topics.

6 coset theories

there is a rich family of cfts which may be obtained from the wzw models by a
simple procedure known under the name of a coset construction [15][16]. on the
functional integral level, the procedure consists of coupling the g-group wzw theory
to a gauge eld ib = i(b10 + b01) with values in a subalgebra h  g . the eld b is
then integrated over with gauge-invariant insertions [17][18][19][20]. let h  g be the
subgroup of g corresponding to h. choose elements tn in the space (end(vrn , vrn ))h
of the intertwiners of the action of h in the irreducible g- and h-representation spaces.
the simplest correlation functions of the g/h coset theory take the form

and the group h cs states, i.e. t : w(, r)  w(, r) with

(t )(b01) = n

tn (b01) .

(6.3)

indeed, it is straightforward to check that the right hand side satises the the group h
version of the ward identity (5.1). eq. (6.2) may be rewritten with the use of the map

where h = (, ). since the above relations hold also for the partition function,
it follows that the calculation of the coset theory correlation functions (6.1) reduces to
that of the scalar products of group g and group h cs states, both given by explicit,
nite-dimensional integrals.

6

among the simplest examples of the coset theories is the case with the group
g = su(2)  su(2) with level (k, 1) (for product groups, the levels may be taken
independently for each group) and with h being the diagonal su(2) subgroup. the
resulting theories coincide with the unitary minimal series of cfts with the virasoro
central charges c = 1 
(k+2)(k+3) , rst considered by belavin-polyakov-zamolodchikov
[1]. the hilbert spaces of these theories are built from irreducible unitary representa-
tions of the virasoro algebras with 0 < c < 1. the simpliest one of them with k = 1
and c = 1
2 describes the continuum limit of the ising model at critical temperature
or the scaling limit of the massless 4
2 theory. in particular, in the continuum limit
() where g takes
the spins in the critical ising model are represented by elds tr g 1
values in the rst su(2). the corresponding correlation functions may be computed
as above. one obtains this way for the 4-point function on the complex plane (or the
riemann sphere) an explicit expression in terms of the hypergeometric function.

2

the g/h coset theory with h = g is a prototype of a two-dimensional topological
eld theory. as follows from eq. (6.4), the correlation functions of the elds tr gr()
are equal to the dimension of the spaces w(, r) , normalized by the dimension of
w(,) and are given by the verlinde formula (5.11).
in particular, they do not
depend on the position of the insertion points, a characteristic feature of the correlation
functions in topological eld theories.

7 boundary conditions in the wzw theory

discussing in sects. 3.4 and 4.1 above the classical and the quantum amplitudes for
the wzw model on surfaces with boundary, we have admitted an arbitrary behavior

40

of the elds on the boundary. in physical situations, one often has to constrain this
behavior by imposing the boundary conditions (bc) on the elds. the simplest example
is provided by the dirichlet or neumann bcs for the free elds which x to zero,
respectively, the tangent or the normal derivative of the eld (the absorbing versus
the reecting condition). such conditions leave unbroken an innite-dimensional set of
symmetries of the free eld theory. we shall be interested in bcs in the wzw model
with a similar property.

the theory of boundary cfts was pioneered by cardy [26] and cardy-lewellen
[27].
it found its applications e.g. in the theory of isolated impurities in condensed
matter physics (in the so called kondo problem, a traditional playground for theoretical
ideas) [28]. in string theory, the use of the neumann bc for free open strings has a
long tradition [29]. the realization that one should also consider free open strings
with the dirichlet bc came much later and gave rise to a theory of dirichlet- or d-
branes [30]: the end of an open string, some of whose coordinates are restricted by
the dirichlet bc, moves on a surface (brane) of a lower dimension. the d-branes
provide the basic tool in the analysis of the non-perturbative eects in string theory: of
the stringy solitons and of the strong-weak coupling dualities [30]. the general theory
of boundary cfts is slowly becoming an important technique of string theory (see
e.g. [31]). here, for the sake of illustration, we shall discuss a particular class of bcs
for the wzw theory. these conditions constrain the group g valued eld g to stay over
the boundary components in xed conjugacy classes of g. such bcs were discussed in
[33], see also [32]. they clearly generalize the dirichlet bc of the free elds, contrary
to the claim in [33] (based on the conventions of reference [34]) associating them to the
neumann bc. our presentation, along similar lines, claries, hopefully, some of the
discussions of the above papers.

7.1 the action
as before, we shall represent a riemann surface  with boundary as  \ (m
m),
where dm are disjoint unit discs embedded in a closed surface  without boundary,
see fig. 6. we have seen in sect. 3.4 that the classical amplitudes es(g) of the elds
g :   g of the wzw model take values in a line bundle l rather than being numbers.
the line bundle l over the loop group lg is not trivial but it may be trivialized over
certain subsets of lg, for example the ones formed by the loops taking values in special
conjugacy classes c. it will then be possible to give numerical values to the amplitudes
es (g) for g :   g satisfying the bcs

since the conjugacy classes c are in one to one correspondence with  in the symplex

 integrable at level k, see the denition (4.9).

the full action s(g) of the boundary wzw model is still obtained by adding
to the wz action sw z the s term of eq. (3.6). the coupling to the gauge eld is
given again by eq. (3.27). the behavior of the complete action under the chiral gauge
transformation may be shown to obey the following bc version of the eq. (3.28):

s(g, a) = s(h1gh1

2 , h2a01 + h1a01) + s(h1

tr (h2a10 h1a01) ,

(7.6)

this conditions, the eld h1gh1
is constrained on the boundary to the same conjugacy
2
classes as g and h1h1
to the trivial one so that the actions on the right hand side make
2
sense. the above relation will be employed below to infer the chiral gauge symmetry
ward identities for the boundary wzw theory. it may be used as the principle that
selects the bcs (7.1).

summarizing: if the eld g :   g satises the bcs (7.1) with integrable weights
m, then the amplitude es

well dened as complex numbers. of course, the mixed case, where the bcs (7.1) with
integrable m are satised only on some boundary components of  and no conditions
are imposed on the other (free) boundary components can be treated in the same
way. it results in the amplitudes

7.2 quantum amplitudes and correlation functions

the functional integral denition (4.1) of the quantum amplitudes of the wzw model

impose the bcs (7.1) with integrable weights m. the resulting amplitudes a,(a)
will be now elements of n free
(l). they may be represented as (partial) contractions
of the amplitudes a(a) with all boundaries free with appropriate states:

this is the chiral gauge symmetry ward identity for the boundary wzw correlation
functions, a variant of the identities (4.21) and (4.22) in presence of the bcs. note,
however, that the identity (7.8) may be factorized as the latter ones only if we assume
that h1 and h2 are equal to 1 on the boundary. the general case where on the boundary
h1 = h2 requires the presence of both gauge transformations h1 and h2.

it is illuminating to rewrite the ward identity (7.8) in a dierent way. to this

end, let us dene a doubled riemann surface without boundary e by gluing  to its

complex conjugate  along the boundary components, see fig. 14.

properties are often summarized by saying that the boundary cft is chiral since its

we infer that the correlations functions of the boundary wzw theory on a surface
 may be viewed, in their gauge eld dependence, as the special states  belonging
to the space w
may be shown, moreover, to be preserved by the parallel transport with respect to the

(, , r, r) of the cs states on the doubled surface e. the states 
kzb connection on the restriction of the bundle fw of the cs states on the doubled
correlation functions are given by special conformal blocks of the wzw theory on e.
it would be desirable to characterize geometrically the cs states  . some of their
special properties are easy to nd. for example, they are preserved by the antilinear
(, , r, r) induced by the involution  of the doubled
involution  7  of w

( ea01) = (( ea01)) .

a complete geometric characterization of the states  for dierent choices  of the
bcs seems, however, still missing.

7.3 piece-wise boundary conditions

up to now, we have imposed the boundary conditions forcing the elds to take val-
ues in the special conjugacy classes uniformly on the component circles of . since

46

the conditions are local, it should be also possible to do this locally on the pieces of
the boundary. suppose that the boundary  is divided into intervals ir (the entire
boundary circles are also admitted). we shall associate integrable weight labels r to
some of these intervals in such a way that two labeled intervals in the same boundary
component are separated by an unlabeled (free) one, see fig. 15.

we shall now consider the elds g on  which on the labeled intervals take values in the
corresponding conjugacy classes cr and are not restricted on the free intervals. one
may still dene the classical amplitudes esw z (g) for such elds although this requires
a more local ( cech cohomology type) technique than the one developed above [36]. let
us sketch how this is done.

recall from the end of sect. 3.1 that s w z (g) in the rst approximation is equal to

4i r g where d =  is the canonical closed 3-form on g. the problem stemmed

47

from the fact that such 2-forms  exist only locally. however, on the sets of a suciently
ne open covering (o) of g, we may choose 2-forms  such that d = . choose
a triangulation t of  with the triangles t, edges e and vertices v. if t is ne enough

the above expression depends, however, on the choice of the forms  and of the

plices of lower dimension. let 0 1

where in the last sum the sign is taken according to the orientation of the vertices
v inherited from the triangles t via the edges e. one may show that for the surface
without boundary, the above expression does not depend on the choices involved and
coincides with the denition given in sect. 3.3.

in the presence of boundary circles with unconstrained elds, the above expression
may be used to dene the amplitudes with values in a line bundle and it provides an
alternative construction of the bundle l over the loop group [36]. in the presence of
the boundary conditions on the intervals ir we shall still employ the same denition,
but with some care. namely, we include neighborhoods o of the conjugacy classes
c into the open covering (o) of g. we choose 2-forms  on o coinciding with 
of eq. (7.2) when restricted to c. the triangulations used in eq. (7.11) are required
to be compatible with the splitting of the boundary. to the simplices in the labeled
intervals ir we asign the open sets or , see fig. 16. the amplitudes resulting from
eq. (7.11) coincide then with those dened in the previous section for the special case
when the labeled intervals ll entire circles. in the general case,

48

the space of sections (lir ) plays, as before, the role of the space of states of the
wzw theory but, this time, on the interval and with boundary conditions specied by
the conjugacy classes cr and c

string moving on the group with the ends on the branes cr and c

one may still dene an action of the central extension of the loop group in the spaces
(lir ) (a single one) and base on its analysis a rigorous construction of the open-string
hilbert spaces of states h  , as we did in sect. 4.1 for the closed-string states, see
eq. (4.10). one obtains

states w(cp 1, , r) with three insertion points in representations r, r and r. in
particular, the dimension of the multiplicity spaces is given by the fusion ring structure

. the spaces h  carry the obvious action of the current algebra bg
and of the virasoro algebra, the latter obtained by the sugawara construction (4.15).
the generator l0  c

h with the same bc on both sides contain the vacua , i.e. the states annihilated

ones for the geometries listed on fig. 18.

the elementary amplitudes (a) and (b) represent, respectively, the vacuum state 
in the closed string space h, and the vacua  in the open string spaces h. the
amplitudes (c) for arbitrary annuli encode the action of the pair of virasoro algebras in
h. in particular, for a complex number q 6= 0 inside the unit disc one may consider the
annular regions aq = { z | |q|  |z|  1}, see fig. 19, obtained from cp 1 by taking
out the unit discs embedded by the maps z 7 qz and z 7 z1.

viewing the amplitude of aq as an operator from the space h associated to the rst
boundary component to h associated to the second boundary, one has:

the gluing of the two boundary circles of aq leads to the complex torus t where

aq aaq = q l0 qel0 .

q = e2i . according to the gluing relation (4.7), this produces the toroidal partition
function

z(t ) = zaq trh (q l0 qel0) .

(7.15)

upon choosing a at metric on t and working out the partition function11 zaq , one
obtains nally

which is nothing else but eq. (5.20).

(7.16)

the amplitude for a disc pw,q,q1 with two round holes, as in fig. 18(d), gives rise to
a 3-linear form on h which may be also viewed as an operator from the space h  h
associated to the inner discs to h corresponding to the outer one. it is customary in
cft to rewrite this amplitude as an operator (e; w) in h labeled by the vectors e in
(a dense subspace of) h and the point w inside the unit disc:
(ql0 qel0 e)  (ql0

(e; w) e = zpw,q,q1 apw,q,q1

the combination with the powers of l0 and el0 assures the independence of the expres-

sion of q and q1. the vectors e can be recovered from the operators (e; w) by acting
with them on the vacuum vector

pictorially, this corresponds to lling up the central whole of pw,q,q1 by gluing a disc to
its boundary. the operators (e; w) satisfy an important relation:

(e; z) (e; w) = ((e; z  w) e; w) .

(7.19)

the above identity holds for 0 < |w| < |z| and 0 < |z  w| < 1. it results from the two
ways that one may obtain the disc with three holes by gluing two discs with two holes,
see fig. 20.

the relation (7.19) may be viewed as a global form of the operator product expansion.
the local forms may be extracted from it by expanding the vector (e; z  w) into
in particular, for specially chosen vectors e and e
terms homogeneous in (z  w).
one obtains the operator versions of the relations (4.25) and (4.31), hence the name
of the latter. the vector-operator correspondence together with the operator product
expansion (7.19) are the cornerstones of the non-perturbative approach to cft.

the amplitudes corresponding to the surfaces with boundary of fig. 18(e) represent
the action of the virasoro algebra in the open string spaces h . the surfaces (f) give
rise, in turn, to the amplitudes which, applied to vectors ql0
e  h, dene the
action of the closed string sector elds (e, w) in the open string spaces h . finally,
the amplitudes of the disc (g) with three labeled and three free boundary intervals
dene 3-linear forms on the corresponding open string spaces. as before in the closed
string sector, one may interpret them in terms of boundary operators labeled by vectors
in, say, h and mapping from h to h .

the gluing properties give rise to non-trivial relations between various amplitudes.
for example, gluing along the free sides a rectangle with a local bc imposed on the
two other sides, see fig. 21, one obtain a nite cylinder zl with the bcs imposed on
the boundary components.

by virtue of the verlinde formula (5.12), the last identity coincides with eq. (7.20). we
have, in fact, inverted here the logic of reference [26], where the consistency of the two
ways of computing the amplitude az
was used to obtain the expression (7.7) for the
boundary states b.

the whole system of elementary amplitudes represents an intriguing algebraic struc-
ture which is common to all (rational) boundary cfts. already the case of boundary
topological eld theories, where the amplitudes depend only on the surface topology,
leads to an interesting construction that remains to be fully understood.
it entan-
gles a commutative algebra structure on the closed string space of states and a non-
commutative algebroid in the open string sector. an example of such a structure was
inherent in the work of kontsevich [37] on the deformation quantization of general pois-
son manifolds, see [38]. certainly, the two-dimensional cft did not unveal yet all of
its secrets.
