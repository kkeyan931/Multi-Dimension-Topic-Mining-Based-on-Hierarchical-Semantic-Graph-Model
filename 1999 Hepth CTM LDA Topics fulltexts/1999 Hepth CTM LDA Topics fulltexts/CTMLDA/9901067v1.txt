abstract

the electromagnetic interaction of massive superparticles with n = 2 extended
maxwell supermultiplet is studied. it is proved that the minimal coupling breaks the
k-symmetry. a non-minimal k-symmetric action is built and it is established that
the k-symmetry uniquely xes the value of the superparticles anomalous magnetic
moment.

1. introduction

it is well known that consistency of the theories of superstrings, super-p -
(and d-) branes [1,2] may be achieved only if the k-symmetry is present in
these theories [3-5]. however, the presence of the k-symmetry in a free super-
symmetric theory doesnt guarantee its presense in a theory with interaction.
this fact accounts for an interest to the problem of the k-symmetry preserva-
tion when passing from free supersymmetric models to ones with interaction.
the model of a charged superparticle coupled to external superpotential [7-9,
12] is one of the simplest supersymmetric schemes with interaction. in the

case of n = 1 massless superparticle the model with interaction possessing
the k-symmetry can be obtained by strict following to the minimality prici-
ple. an important consequence of the k-symmetry existence is presence of
the correct constraints for supereld strengths which remove unphysical elds
and single out the n = 1 maxwell supermultiplet. analogous situation takes
place in the case of n = 1 supergravity.

in ref.[4] has been proposed an extended (n > 1) free superparticle model
which possesses the k-symmetry and, unlike the n = 1 case, permits the co-
variant (although reducible) division of the grassmanian constraints without
introduction of the auxiliary variables such as twistor-like ones [10]. how-
ever, consistency of the minimality principle and the k-symmetry is violated
when passing to that superparticle model coupled to extended n > 1 super-
potential. as revealed by luzanna and milevski in ref.[12], this breakdown
requires, the modications of the model, analogous to those of the refs.[13,14]
for the spinning particles. these modications, based on the mass renor-
malization prescription, turned out to be equivalent to the introduction of
an anomalous magnetic moment (amm) for the spinning particles as it was
established in ref.[15], where a supereld description was given. moreover,
no restrictions on the amm magnitude of the spinning particle appeared.

in some sense a similar situation appears in the model of n = 2 mas-
sive superparticle which is studied below. however, here the requrement of
the k-symmetry existence severely restricts the amm value of superparticle.
clarication of this statement is a reason for this paper.

the paper is organised as follows: section 2 is devoted to the study of
the free n = 2 massive superparticle model [4]. in the section 3 we examine
this model when the minimal coupling with an external n = 2 superpoten-
tial is introduced. then the problem of the k-symmetry breaking for this
coupling is discussed. in the section 4 we build k-symmetric action for the
superparticle interacting with the external n = 2 superpotential. we show
that the restoration of the k-symmetry of the action is provided by means
of the nonminimal terms introduction. this nonminimal extension of the
model corresponds to taking into account the electromagnetic interactions
of the superparticle caused by its amm. moreover, the value of this amm
turns out to be xed.

2. n = 2 massive superparticle model

among various superparticle models of the most interest are those, which
possess the k-symmetry. in particular, these are massless superparticles in
d = 3, 4, 6, 10 with an arbitrary number of supersymmetries [5]. at the same

2

time a transition to the corresponding massive superparticle model violates
the k-symmetry. however, when n > 1 there exists the possibility to avoid
these diculties by means of wess-zumino -witten-like term introduction.
for the d = 4 case such model was suggested in [4] and for the d = 6, 10 in
[6].

we resort the d = 4, n > 1 case [4], where to the brink-schwarz action

was added the additional term

i aij j +  iaij  

j ,

where aij is a real antisymmetric matrix depending on the superparticles
mass. this term is invariant under global supersymmetry transformations
up to the total derivative and is a 1d analogue of the super-p-branes wess-
zumino-witten term [5]. in the n = 2 case this matrix is simply mij and
the superparticle action takes form

s = z dq + mz d (cid:18)

and the standard hamiltonian

h0 = xp +

having the constraints requires introduction of the full hamiltonian

h = h0 + v +   v  + pg,

we need to have the poisson brackets denition

.

using (5) we can evaluate several important poisson brackets

nv, vo = 2im,(cid:26) v , v (cid:27) = 2im  ,nv, v o = 2p ,

np2 + m2, vo = 0,

np2 + m2, v o = 0.

now, according to the dirac prescription [16], we study equations, obtained
from the primary constraints by the temporal conservation conditions:

{pg, h} = 0 =  = p2 + m2  0, (secondary constraint)
o = 2imi

nh, v io = 2

this condition however does not x systems rank, which in our case equals
four 1, so only half of the equations (9) are linear independent and, as a
consequence, four of the lagrange multipliers () remain unxed. this
indicates the presence of the local fermionic symmetry of the action (1),
which is just the k-symmetry, and existence of the four spinorial rst-class
constraints, generating this symmetry. the rest of the spinorial constraints
in (3) belong to the second-class. at this point the new problem arises:
how is it possible to produce the covariant division of the rst- and second-
class spinorial constraints? the matrix a (10) prompts us to use the set of
projectors [17], separating the rst- and second-class constraints

and  satises the strong relation 2 = 1. the multiplier (cid:16)p2(cid:17) was

introduced here for a normalization. the projectors pi and pii obey the
following relations: p 2

although we managed to separate constraints in the manifestly covariant way
we have got, however, the linearly dependent sets of the rst- and second-class

the bosonic constraint  belongs
reparametrization generator), but the external superpotential coupling con-
verts it to the second-class as will be seen below

{, } = 0,

{, v} = 0,

{, v } = 0.

(15)

thus, our analysis explicitly shows how to covariantly separate the
fermionic constraints and to construct the k-symmetry transformations. the
total constraints algebra is presented in the appendix b.

the next step in our analysis will be investigation of the consistency be-
tween the k-symmetry and the minimal coupling procedure to introduce the
interaction of a superparticle with an external superpotential.

here we restrict ourselves by the electromagnetic u(1) group case. the gauge

superelds am (x, , ) = (cid:16)a, ai

, a i(cid:17) contain a great number of unphysical

component elds, which have to be removed by imposing gauge invariant
constraints on the supereld strengths. the requirement of the k-symmetry
existence will restrict the admissible form of these constraints.

now we consider the hamiltonian treatment of the model (16) and intro-

duce the canonical momenta

and the canonical hamiltonian is given by

h0 =

g

2 h(p  iea)2 + m2i

the total hamiltonian is

h = h0 + v +   v  + pg.

(19)

(20)

below we remind some useful poisson brackets relations following from
eqs.(18-19)

{v, v} = 2im  ef;

{ v , v } = 2im    ef  ;

{v, v } = 2p   ef , where p  = p   iea ;

the eld strenghts are dened in [18]. temporal conservation of the primary
constraints leads to the secondary one  = p + m2  0 and to the system of
the linear equations for the lagrange mulipliers

e = q + m + 

e  = q  + n  + 

n  = 0
 m   = 0

q + q   = 0,

where we have used the following notations:

q =

m = 2im  ef,

eg
2 p

f , ;

q  =
m   = 2im    ef  ;

(22)

(23)

n  = 2p   ef .

it is easy to show that the last equation in (22) is a consequence of the
others. similarly to the free case, the existence of the four spinorial rst-
class constraints imposes certain restrictions on the rank of the system (22).
namely, this rank should be equal to four. the matrix of the system (22)
equals

a = 


m n

n t

m




(24)

respectively, the matrix of the extended system can be written in the form

aex = 


m n q
m  q
n t

.




(25)

using well-known properties of the rank invariance one can persuade that
rank a = rank r and det a = det r, where

r = 


m

0

n

m  n t m1n

.




(26)

we suppose that det m 6= 0, so rank m = 4. indeed, det m 6= 0 when the
interaction is turned o, so it is quite reasonable to assume its conserva-
tion when interaction is turned on. then we nd that rank a = rank m =
rank r = 4 and

y   = m    n m1n  = 0.

(27)

7

the system (22) is compatible, when and only when rank a = rank aex = 4
or, equivalently,

rank aex = rank


m n

q

0

0  q + n t m1q

= 4,

(28)




the latter equation implies the constraint

q   n m1q = 0

(29)

provided that det n 6= 0.
thus, we conclude that the systems rank is halved, if and only if the
new constraints (27,29) are satised. in view of this observation the total
hamiltonian (20) should be extended to the form

2. the new
lagrange multipliers  dene the rst-class constraints.
it is well known
that the rst-class constraints form a closed algebra. to prove that we are
dealing with just this case, we are to calculate the poisson brackets of the
two second-class constraints

power with the coecients constructed from the spinorial components of the
supereld strengths. this essential feature will play the crucial role in our
further analysis. now we are going to study the poisson brackets for v (1)

y possesses the polynomial structure of the third power with respect to
p  with the coecient functions depending on the supereld strengths. it
is not a function of the present constraints, so we are forced to consider
it as a new constraint. again, we calculate the poisson brackets for y
and v (1)
to obtain a new fourth power polynomial constraint, which should
be then considered as a new constraint. in the limit, the above-described
procedure leads to an innite sequence of polynomial constraints of arbitrary
high power with respect to p  with the coecient functions constructed
from the supereld strengths. a controlled analysis of the exact form of
these innite constraints chain is rather dicult, since we have not found
any recursion procedure for their presentation as functions of y.

the only reason, why we have got innite set of the constraints, is that
the object y1...n appearing on every stage was considered as the creation
of a new constraint. a possibility to avoid such uncontrolled multiplication
of the constraints supposes their identical fullment (for the total set of p )
starting from a certain stage. taking into account the structure mentioned
above, the identical fullment actually signies some restriction for the su-
pereld congurations. the identical fullment of the n-th stage constraint
yields the identical fullment of the next stage constraints. although we
cant realize this procedure for an arbitrary stage (because of the sophisti-
cated structure of the appearing expressions), here we present the explicit
consideration of the rst and the second stages.

9

at the rst stage we deal with y. for our purpose it will be convenient

to introduce the su(2)-decomposition of the supereld strengths
f =  w +  ij
and then the matrix inverse to m takes the form

after the substitution of the constraints (35-37) into the supereld bianchi
identities, we nd the following restrictions for the physical superelds w and
w : d w = d w = 0 and dijw  dij w = 0, which isolate n = 2 maxwell

at the second stage the nullication of the cubic term in p  from eqs.(32)

yields the two possibilities:

a) d  f   = 0, d w = 0;
b) f   = 0.

now, by analogy with the rst stage, the linear terms impose too strong
constraints on the chiral superelds w and w : dw = d  w = 0. and,
again, we conclude that the identical fullment of y eliminates physical
degrees of freedom.

although we could not prove it evidently, it is quite reasonable to con-
jecture that the identical fullment of the next stage constraints wlll also
eliminate the physical degrees of freedom. then the necessity for the intro-
duction of nonminimal terms to preserve the k-symmetry becomes evident.

4. a nonminimal coupling

of n = 2 massive superparticle

there exists a possibility to introduce some nonminimal terms for a su-
perparticle possessing not only the electrical charge e, but also an amm ,
in such a way that the minimal structure of the interactions caused by the
electric charge, will be preserved. taking into account the dimensional rea-
sons ([] = l in the system c = h = 1) we can construct the dimensionless
 linear in the eld strenghts. anal-
gauge invariant scalars f 
ogous considerations were used in [19] for the introduction of nonmininal
terms by means of the extension of the superconnection 1form. then the
superparticle action can be written in the form

(44)

the total hamiltonian reads

h = h0 + v +   v  + pg.

(43)

note that, unlike h and h0, the primary constraints dont feel nonminimal
terms. as in section 3, the temporal conservation of the primary constraints
leads to the secondary constraint  = p 2 + m2  0 and to the linear system
of equations for lagrange multipliers coinciding with (23), if the following
redenitions are taken into account

q =

(45)

to have the rst-class spinorial constraints, generating the k-
again,
symmetry, we need to halve the system rank. the necessary and sucient
condition of the rank halving is the presence of the constraints (27,29), as in
the section 3. again the spinorial rst-class constraints read

v (1)
 = v  n 

m1   v .

12

(46)

so, the analysis performed in the previous section is also valid here, and we
can formulate the conclusion: the possibility to avoid a sequence of innite
constraints is the identical fullment of the constraint (27). substituting
explicit expressions for m and n matrices and using the mass-shell condition
we get:

-the quadratic term

2(m  iew/2)


-the linear term

f  = 0;

(48)

-the free term

(m  iew/2)  e f = 0.

in each order. taking into account  -matrices linear independence one has:

f = 0

(49)

and

(m + ie w /2)(m  iew/2) = (m + im w )(m  imw ).

(49)
substituting the constraints (47-49) into the bianchi identities for the super-
eld strengths leads to the standard constraints on n = 2 physical superelds

d w = d w = dijw  dij w = 0.

(50)

the remaining constraint (49) either xes the amm magnitude  = e
2m,
imposing no further constraints on w and w , or eliminates the physical de-
grees of freedom. so, unlike the minimal case, nonminimal one gives rise to
the rst-class constraints (and the k-symmetry), but at certain eld cong-
urations (50) and  = e
2m. then the superparticle lagrangian is presented

solve equations (23) subjected to the constraints (47-50) and substitute the

actually describes the superparticle amm. for this purpose we are to consider

5. conclusions

we have examined the n = 2 extended massive superparticle model [4]
(with and without interactions) following to the dirac prescription and evolv-
ing the results [12]. in the free case this model possesses the k-symmetry
which allows to gauge away a half of fermionic degrees of freedom. including
the minimal interaction with the abelian gauge supereld am (x, , ) and
demanding the k-symmetry existence, as in the free case, imposes too strong
constraints on the supereld strengths fm n , which eliminate the component
elds of the n = 2 maxwell multiplet. so we present an explicit proof for the
conclusion that the model with minimal coupling actually does not permit
k-invariant terms of interaction. to restore the k-invariance we introduced
the nonminimal terms into the lagrangian of the superparticle, which de-
scribes the amm caused interactions, as weve shown. thus the idea of the
nonminimal terms introduction, earlier advanced in [12], gets here its ex-
plicit realization by means of constructing the nonminimal lagrangian. this
lagrangian is invariant under the k-symmetry transformations, only if the
amm value of the massive superparticle is rigorously xed.

appendix a

in the present paper we use following metric signature:  = diag(, +, +, +).

variant way:

 = ij

 i =   ij 

i = ijj

the above formulae can be used to dene the scalars:

the conjugation rules for spinors, derivatives, -matrixes and potentials are
the following

appendix b

this appendix is devoted to the constraints algebra.
a) free superparticle case:

each rst-class constraint commutes with each second-class one and bosonic
rst-class constraint  commutes with all of them.

where ga = (v (1),(2)
in (b.1) only the rst term determines
which of the constraints belongs to the rst-class and which to the second.
that is why we omit below complicated expressions or other terms and use
weak equalities
