1 introduction

there has been recently some interest in higher dimensional topological eld theories.
in
particular baulieu and west studied a six dimensional topological model of two-form elds in
[1]. they also discussed the brst quantization of this model and a new kind of topological
twist operation specic to (2, 0) supersymmetry in six dimensions. the aim of this paper is to
elaborate on their work and investigate closer the brst-structure of the model and its relation
to a twist of the (2, 0) supersymmetry. more specically we are looking for a completion of
the topological supersymmetry. in [1] the authors showed that the part of the brst-operator
that encodes the topological shift symmetry can be thought of being obtained by twisting the
(2, 0) poincare supersymmetry algebra. the complete brst operator is built up by promoting
also the usual two-form eld gauge symmetries to a brst-symmetry. all this structure is
completely parallel to what happens in four dimensional topological yang-mills theory [2, 3].
in the latter theory it has been shown that there also exists a fermionic vectorial supersym-
metry whose anti-commutator with the brst-operator closes onto translation [4]. of course,
the existence of this additional symmetry can to some extent be motivated from the fact that
the twist of the n = 2 supersymmetry in four dimensions also gives rise to vectorial supersym-
metric partner of the brst-charge [5]. it seems therefore natural to ask also for such a vector
supersymmetry in the topological model of [1]. it is this question which we will investigate in
this paper.

the paper is organized as follows. in section two we will present the model and discuss the
brst action on the gauge eld sector. in section three we present the gauge xing of the shift
symmetry q and the symmetry s. additionally, we rewrite the q-xed action in a new basis for
later use. in the next section we establish the existence of the topological supersymmetry and
discuss the twist operation of the (2, 0) supersymmetry. we obtain the q-operator related to
the topological shift symmetry and also a vector operator. in this context we point out that the
form of the vectorial transformation laws are in close analogy to the vectorial transformation
laws obtained by twisting the four dimensional n = 2 super yang mills theory. concluding, we
state why the transformations derived from the twisting procedure do not close onto translations
modulo gauge-transformations and e.o.m..

2 gauge eld and ghosts

for the construction of a tqft in six dimensions one needs two-form elds b2 = 1
dx and cb2 = 1

2 b dx 
cb dx  dx constrained by the self-duality conditions between these two

independent real two forms

[b] +

[cb] = 0,

in order to get a topological invariant action cl which does not vanish trivially

cl = z f3  cf3.

(1)

(2)

the corresponding eld strength tensors are dened by f3 = db2 and cf3 = dcb2, where
d = dx denotes the exterior derivative. the action (2) possesses two gauge symmetries

2b2 = 2 and 1b2 = d1,

(3)

and similar equations for cb2. 2 and 1 are a two-form and a one-form characterizing the
innitesimal gauge symmetry.

the usual brst-quantization demands that these innitesimal gauge parameters are trans-

formed into ghost elds 1

2 and v 1
1 .

corresponding to equ.(3) the total brst operator is therefore dened by

s = q + s,

(4)

where q represents the topological shift symmetry [2] and s is the usual brst-symmetry
induced by the gauge freedom of the model. generalizing the concepts of [6] the total brst-
symmetry is constructed by the so called horizontality conditions

(s + d)(cid:16)b2 + v 1

1 + m2(cid:17) = f3 + 1

2 + 2

1 + 3,

which implies the horizontality condition

(s + d)(cid:16)f3 + 1

2 + 2

1 + 3(cid:17) = 0,

by virtue of the nilpotency of (s + d). equ.(5) yields in terms of forms

s3 = 0.

the transformations in component notation for b , 1

and the non-vanishing brst-symmetry stemming from the gauge freedom is given through

nilpotent and fulll therefore

3 gauge xing procedure

3.1 the shift symmetry

in order to implement the self-duality condition (1) one introduces a general three-form h3 =
3! hdx  dx  dx with its corresponding anti-ghost 1
1
dx  dx  dx. these
elds are members of a brst-doublet

3 = 1

3! 1

q1

 = h, qh = 0,

(13)

for the gauge-xing of the q-symmetry one proceeds similarly by an introduction of the anti-
ghost elds 2

 , 3, x 1 with their brst-doublet partners (see also table 2)

 , q1

 = 1

q2
 = 0,
q3 = 2, q2 = 0,
qx 1 = 2, q2 = 0.

(14)

in the spirit of [1, 7] we are now able to x the topological shift symmetry with its reducible

we also included additional couplings with parameters i which are consistent with the sym-
metries, dimensions and q-charges. later on, we will see that the topological vector susy
places some restrictions on these parameters.

(23)

we would like to stress that our q-xed action diers from equ.(2.23) in [1]. it seems that this
can be traced back to the following. in [1] the authors assumed the elds 1
, h to be
self-dual (with c and ch antiself-dual). since in six dimensions the variation with respect
ch   c.c.
to a self-dual eld is antiself-dual one would need to introduce cross terms like (
in order to generate an equation of motion like (16). the introduction of such cross terms is
however equivalent to our method of assuming 1
 and h not to fulll (anti)self-duality
conditions.
these mixing terms ( and c1) make it impossible to understand the
action as the sum of two free six-form multiplets plus one decoupled part of purely topological
packages.
the q-transformations after the insertion of the algebraic equations of motion, equal those
found in [1].

except for the equation involving 1

 similar transformations are valid for the cc-sector.

for later use, we write the action and the q-transformations in a dierent basis. in order
to write the redenitions as compact as possible we use the shorthand  = (f, b, 1, 2, 3):

(26)

we denote the (anti-)selfdual parts of a three form by the superscripts +(), whereas the
subscript +() , is related to the plus (minus) sign in the eld redenitions in (25). rewriting
the action (23) yields:

can be read as the product of these sectors. furthermore the q-transformation respects this

4 the topological linear vector supersymmetry

it is well known that topological eld models of schwarz type are also characterized by the
fact that these models posses an additional symmetry: the topological linear vector supersym-
metry, which is responsible for the perturbative niteness of the model. in [4] is shown that
this topological linear vector susy is also present in the topological yang-mills theory in four
dimensional space-time if one uses a linear gauge condition for the shift ghost 1
 instead of the
non-linear gauge condition of this witten-type model. however, one knows that this model is
not perturbative nite. the existence of this topological linear vector susy improves consid-
erable the discussion of the algebraic renormalization procedure - leading to an anomaly free
theory [4]. additionally, one has to stress that in schwarz type models quantized in the axial
gauge the constraints coming from the vector susy allow only tree-graphs which are alway! s
perturbatively nite.

it seems to be quite natural to investigate the possibility of the existence of this vector
susy also for the model under discussion.usually, the vector susy can be constructed from the
fact that cl is metric-independent, whereas the metric dependence emerges by the gauge-xing
procedure entailing that the energy-momentum tensor can be written as brst exact expression
[7]

t = s.

(42)

from equ.(42) follows in a standard manner in calculating the divergence of the energy-
momentum tensor - and in considering2

(43)

the existence of the vector susy. due to the fact that the model in question is a free abelian
one, no external unquantized sources are needed in order to describe the non-linear pieces of

s. this implies that the -symmetry is not broken linearly by the quantum elds as it is the
case for interacting topological eld models. usually, the brst-operator and the -operation
closes on on-shell on space-time translations

{s, } =  + eom.

(44)

however, for the model under consideration the wess-zumino type algebra (44) is an o-shell
relation. (44) implies that the -symmetry is in some sense the inverse of the brst-symmetry.
for the explicit construction of the vector susy we have chosen a general ansatz which
coecients are determined by the algebra (44) and the ward identity (43). this places also
restrictions on the gauge parameters. in particular, we have to set 1 = 2 = 3 = 0 and
i = 0 to obtain a model which is invariant under the vector susy. the transformations of the
gauge eld and the ghosts then are

v 1
 = b , 2

b = 0,

3 = m2,

(45)

(46)

one deduces that for each brst-doublet there exists also a corresponding -doublet. it is
straightforward to prove that  (cl + q + gf ) = 0 is indeed valid.

5 twist

in a next step we try to reconstruct the topological shift and vector-supersymmetry transfor-
mations of the elds through a twist of a supersymmetry multiplet. hence, we need a tensor
multiplet containing a second-rank antisymmetric tensor gauge eld. in six dimensions this is
given by a (2,0) tensor multiplet which consists of the desired tensor b, a real eld ij and
a spinor i.

10

the spinors in six dimensions transform under spin(1, 5)  spin(5), where spin(5) is iso-
morphic to u sp(4). u sp(4) also provides the existence of symplectic majorana-weyl spinors.
the symplectic majorana-weyl condition is


i = b 

ijj,

(47)

where  = 1, 2, 3, 4 are the spinor indices which transform under weyl-projected spin(1, 5),
whereas i = 1, 2, 3, 4 denote internal indices transforming under u sp(4). the metric ij is
real and antisymmetric and allows raising and lowering of the internal indices by i = ijj
respectively i = jji. the matrix b is unitary and acts like   = b

 and  =  b
 .

with the constraint ijij = 0 this yields three respectively ve bosonic on-shell degrees of

freedom for b and ij, and eight fermionic on-shell degrees of freedom for i [8].

in order to perform the topological twist [9] we have to break down so(1, 5) to so(5),
since so(5) is locally isomorphic to u sp(4). now the twist is done by choosing the diagonal
subgroup of the symmetry group so(5)  u sp(4). the invariant axis under so(5) will be
denoted by n = (1,~0) in the vector representation. for the spin-representation the vector n
is translated to n (). the spin(5) sub-group consists of the rotations of spin(1, 5) that
do not change n (). now technically diagonalizing so(5)  u sp(4) is done by identifying
the respective indices (  i, ...). some care is in order, as a metric, similar to ij of u sp(4) is
missing so far. as a metric of spin(5) n () has to be chosen, as it is invariant by denition
and any dierent met! ric would further constrain the set of rotations. identifying indices forces
one to identify the matrices as well, so one has to set

the supersymmetry action on the components of the complexied multiplet is given by3

[1] that one has to add a topological package of scalar elds of opposite statistics (3, (2)0)

the eld content of the q-xed action in section (3.1) we have to take also a twisted (0, 2)
multiplet, which gives us anti-self dual part.

(54)

in [5] similar results for the shift symmetry and the vector supersymmetry were obtained
in the case of wittens topological yang-mills theory by twisting the n = 2 supersymmetric

4 q and  are obtained by using analogous decompositions as in (50) for the supersymmetry parameters.

this implies that there are also some tensorial transformations. we do not further investigate these.

algebra. however, an analysis of the results of [5] shows that they dier from the results given
in [4]. this is due to the fact that the twist procedure starts with a supersymmetric multiplet
in the wess-zumino-gauge. the super-poincare algebra closes on translations only modulo
gauge-transformations and equations of motion. hence, the twist leads to an algebra that looks
like

{q, } =  + equations of motion + gauge-transformations,

where we denoted the twisted vector supersymmetry by . the model which one obtains, is
not totally gauge-xed, since the gauge-degree of freedom for a is left [2]. we expect that the
twist in a manifestly n = 2 supersymmetric formulation would give a result as in [4]. in this
way the existence of a vector supersymmetry in the gauge xed n = 2 sym can be motivated.
let us contrast this now to our ndings in the six dimensional model at hand. the vector
operator (54) can be constructed in rather analogous way as in the four dimensional sym. its
properties are however rather dierent. we nd that { q, } does not close on translations
modulo gauge transformations and equations of motion. this is because the six dimensional
supersymmetry makes use of schoutens identities (see e.g. [8]) valid for symplectic majorana-
weyl spinors. the latter property is however broken by the twist, as already noted in [1]. in
order to connect the twisted (2, 0) multiplet with the eld content of the topological model one
has also to introduce the topological package (3, (2)0). one might hope that these elds
can compensate the terms breaking the schoutens identities. however one gets disappointed.
it is not possible to incorporate 3 such that the algebra closes even on these elds. lorentz
symmetry and ghost number conservation make it impossible.

therefore, contrary to the case in four dimensions, the existence of a topological vector
susy we found in the previous chapter seems rather unrelated with the fact that part of the
brst-operator can be constructed by a twist of the six dimensional (2, 0) multiplet.
