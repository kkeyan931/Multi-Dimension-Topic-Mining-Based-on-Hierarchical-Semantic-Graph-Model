abstract

we show how chiral type i models whose tadpole conditions have no supersymmetric

solution can be consistently dened introducing antibranes with non-supersymmetric

world volumes. at tree level, the resulting stable non-bps congurations correspond

to tachyon-free spectra, where supersymmetry is broken at the string scale on some

(anti)branes but is exact in the bulk, and can be further deformed by the addition of

brane-antibrane pairs of the same type. as a result, a scalar potential is generated,

that can stabilize some radii of the compact space. this setting has the novel virtue

of linking supersymmetry breaking to the consistency requirements of an underlying

fundamental theory.

introduction

2

type i models have become the subject of an intense activity during the last few years,

since their perturbative denition [1] oers interesting new possibilities for low-energy phe-

nomenology, and in particular leaves some freedom to lower the string scale well below the

planck mass, if some extra dimensions are large [2, 3, 4, 5]. their consistency and a number

of their most amusing features may be traced to the relation to suitable parent models

of oriented closed strings, from which their spectra can be derived. in this procedure, a

special role is played by tadpole conditions for ramond-ramond (rr) states [6]. these

may be regarded as global neutrality conditions for rr charges [7], constrain the (integer)

chan-paton multiplicities, and are usually linked to gauge and gravitational anomalies.

the explicit study of type i vacua, however, has revealed an unexpected diculty: in

some interesting chiral four-dimensional models it is apparently impossible to satisfy some

of the tadpole conditions [8, 9]. this peculiar phenomenon can often be traced to sign ips

of some crosscap contributions or, in more suggestive space-time language, to the reversal

of some orientifold charges. examples are actually known where the solution would lead to

negative chan-paton multiplicities, thus violating the positivity of the annulus amplitude,

or where no solution can be found in general, because crosscaps and boundaries scale

dierently with the internal volume.

in a recent work, it was shown how this diculty can be evaded, in a prototype six-

dimensional z2 model and in the four-dimensional z2  z2 orientifold, if one relaxes the
condition that the brane conguration be supersymmetric, thus allowing for vacua includ-

ing both branes and antibranes. as a result, supersymmetry is broken on some collection

of branes at the string scale, while it is preserved (to lowest order) in the bulk and possibly

on other branes. aside from its interest for the consistent denition of type i models,

this scenario, termed in [10] brane supersymmetry breaking, has clearly some beauty

of its own if our non-supersymmetric universe is modeled as a brane in a bath of higher-

3

dimensional supergravity. rather than being introduced as a possible deformation, the

breaking of supersymmetry in our low-energy world would then be seen as a neat con-

sequence of the internal consistency of the underlying string theory. moreover, in this

context the present experimental limits on small-distance deviations from newtonian grav-

ity leave open the exciting possibility that supersymmetry, broken on our world brane, be

almost exact a millimeter away from it. we would like to stress that this mechanism links

supersymmetry breaking to the string scale, rather than to geometric scales of the internal

space, as scherk-schwarz [11, 12, 13, 14] or magnetic [15] deformations. the natural dis-

tinction between these two settings, however, is closely linked to a geometric interpretation

of the two-dimensional conformal field theory, and is somewhat blurred in non-geometric

settings, such as those recently explored in [16].

actually, all these vacua can be further deformed.

in particular, in type i models

one can add arbitrary numbers of d9  d9 and d5  d5 brane pairs without violating

any rr tadpole condition [17, 18], but introducing additional breakings of supersymmetry

on the branes. for instance, starting from the z3 orientifold of [19], one can thus build

semi-realistic three-generation models [20]. we would like to stress that the introduction

of (anti)5-branes requires in general that additional z2 projections act on the boundaries

consistently with the closed spectrum. in this case the resulting congurations are generally

unstable, due to the presence of tachyonic modes that, however, can often be lifted by

suitable wilson lines (or, equivalently, by suitable brane displacements). this should be

contrasted with the original setting for brane supersymmetry breaking [10], where the

brane conguration involves branes and antibranes of dierent types and is by construction

stable. still, in both settings the models include non-bps (anti)brane systems of the type

considered in [21], whose interactions with gravity are consistently described by type i

string theory.

in this work we discuss in more detail the open descendants of two typical examples

4

of type iib orbifolds, where the problem of unsolvable tadpoles was rst encountered. we

begin in section 2 with a detailed discussion of four-dimensional z2  z2 models with
discrete torsion, showing how the unavoidable reversal of some of the orientifold charges

is naturally accompanied, in a fully consistent construction, by the simultaneous presence

of branes and antibranes. we also discuss similar modications of the open descendants

of the corresponding freely-acting orbifolds recently studied in [14]. in section 3 we turn

to the t 6/z4 orbifold, a canonical case where the tadpole conditions can not be solved.

here we can display a consistent non-supersymmetric solution, provided the klein-bottle

projection is also modied, with the net result of lifting the oending twisted tadpole.

we should stress, however, that the diculties met in these two classes of orbifolds are

rather distinct. in type-i models, the twisted tadpoles are generally related to non-abelian

gauge anomalies, whereas the untwisted ones are related to gravitational anomalies, ab-

sent in four dimensions. in the z2  z2 models with discrete torsion the twisted tadpoles
are actually solvable, whereas the untwisted ones are not, and as a result even the naive

supersymmetric open spectrum is free of non-abelian gauge anomalies [8]. on the other

hand, in the z4 model with standard klein bottle the problem is related to the twisted

tadpoles, and as a result the naive supersymmetric open spectrum has non-abelian gauge

anomalies [9]. in section 4 we discuss the possible deformations of type i models to stable

vacuum congurations including both branes and antibranes of the same type. in partic-

ular, we discuss deformations of six-dimensional toroidal compactications, that may thus

include arbitrary pairs of d9  d9 and d5  d5 branes, and present a similar generaliza-

tion of the four-dimensional t 6/z4 orientifold studied in section 3. we show explicitly how

the presence of additional brane-antibrane pairs, via the resulting ns-ns (neveu-schwarz)

tadpoles, can actually stabilize the radii of the compact internal space. all the models

presented in this paper are meant to provide new instances of the phenomenon discussed in

[10]: to lowest order, the d-branes are supersymmetric (with suitable diagonal subgroups

of the antibrane gauge groups realized as global symmetries), while the antibranes are not.

5

finally, section 5 contains our conclusions and the two appendices collect some relevant

properties of the characters used in the text.

2. z2  z2 orientifolds and discrete torsion

let us begin by displaying the torus amplitude for the parent type iib z2 z2 orbifold.
aside from the identity, that we denote by o, the other three elements act on the three

internal two-tori as

g : (+,,)

,

f : (, +,)

,

h : (,, +)

.

(2.1)

in the z2  z2 orbifold, one has the freedom of introducing discrete torsion [22], that
corresponds to associating a sign  = 1 to the independent modular orbit containing all
terms that are twisted and projected by two dierent orbifold operations. omitting for

brevity the contributions of the space-time bosons, the torus amplitudes of the two z2 z2
models are

where the 16 z2  z2 characters kl [8], combinations of products of level-one so(2) char-
acters, are displayed in appendix a. the choices  = 1 identify the models with and
without discrete torsion, whose low-energy spectra are quite dierent: in the rst n = 2
supergravity is coupled to 52 hypermultiplets and 3 vector multiplets, while in the second

it is coupled to 4 hypermultiplets and 51 vector multiplets. these spectra correspond to

orbifold limits of calabi-yau manifolds with hodge numbers (51, 3) and (3, 51), respectively.

the  projections that we are considering are implemented by the klein-bottle ampli-

tudes

where pk and wk denote the restrictions of the lattice sums k to their momentum and

winding sublattices. discrete torsion has a neat eect [14] on (pk + wk):

if  = 1, the

massless twisted contributions are diagonal combinations of the kl, and appear in the

klein bottle, while if  = 1 they are o-diagonal combinations, and do not contribute to
it. consistently with the crosscap constraint [23], (2.4) can accommodate three additional

signs k. actually, these are not independent, but are linked to the parameter  by the

constraint

one can write this amplitude as

tions over repeated indices and symmetrizations over distinct indices are left implicit. an

where the superscript e denotes the restriction of the lattice sums to their even terms and

the vk denote the volumes of the three internal tori. at the origin of the lattices, the

constraint (2.5) leads to an expression whose coecients are perfect squares,

that shows rather neatly how the choice k = 1 reverts the charge of the o5k orientifold
plane. while manifestly compatible with the usual positivity requirements, this reversal

clearly aects the tadpole conditions, that require the introduction of antibranes. in this

respect, it should be appreciated that, according to (2.5), discrete torsion implies the

reversal of at least one of the o5 charges. therefore, taking into account the presence of

the k, one can identify four classes of models, determined by the independent choices for

(1, 2, 3). if  = 1, the choice (+, +, +) gives the model discussed in [8, 24], with 48 chiral

multiplets from the closed twisted sectors, while the choice (+,,) gives a model with 16
chiral multiplets and 32 vector multiplets from the twisted sectors. on the other hand, for

 = 1 the two choices (+, +,) and (,,) yield the same massless twisted spectrum,
namely 48 chiral multiplets.

in order to describe the annulus amplitude, it is convenient to introduce a compact

notation. if t ns

kl (t r

kl) denote the ns (r) parts of the usual combinations of supersymmetric

z2  z2 characters, we thus dene

t ()
kl = t ns

kl  t r

kl (= t (+)

combinations t ()

kl with reversed rr charges, associated to the interactions between branes
and antibranes, do not. as a result, the corresponding terms in a, describing open strings
stretched between branes and antibranes, contain new combinations t ()

where no, dg;o, df ;o and dh;o are the charges for the d9 branes and for the three sets of d5

dg;k, df ;k and dh;k (k = g, f, h) parametrize the breakings induced by the three orbifold

operations g, f and h. as expected, the rr part of every term describing the interaction

between a brane and an antibrane has a reversed sign. the untwisted terms at the origin

moreover, the breaking terms reect rather neatly the geometry of the (anti)brane congu-

ration. indeed, the coecient that multiplies a given twisted character is a sum of squares

associated to the xed tori of the various twisted sectors, and each square contains the
breaking terms for the branes present in the xed tori, with factors v if they are wrapped
around them or 1/v if they are localized on them. the relative coecients of these terms

are also directly linked to the brane geometry, and are given by

s

# of xed tori

# of occupied xed tori

.

(2.12)

thus, for a given twisted sector, the numerator counts the xed tori, while the denominator

counts the xed tori where branes are actually present. moreover, the r portions of the

characters describing brane-antibrane exchanges have reverted signs also in these twisted

contributions, as expected. for instance, in the g-twisted sector of the (+ +) model, that
contains d53 branes, the reection coecients for the massless modes in gh are

10

one xed torus, while the coecients of df ;g and dh;g are 2/v1, since the d52 and d53

are conned to four of the xed tori. finally, out of the 16 g-xed tori, one sees all the

branes, three see only the d9 and the d52, three see only the d9 and the d53 and, nally,

nine see only the d9.

the models where only one k is negative have discrete torsion and contain one d5.

for the d9 and the two sets of d5 branes, the gauge groups are u(8)  u(8), with n = 1
supersymmetry, while for the d5 branes the gauge group is usp(8)4, with n = 0. moreover,
the 59 and 5k5l strings are supersymmetric, while the 95 and 5k5 strings are not. let us
discuss in some detail the case (1, 2, 3) = (+ + ), that contains d5 branes wrapped
around the third torus. to this end, let us parametrize the charges as

no = o + g + o + g ,

on the other hand, the strings whose ends live on the antibrane give rise to supersym-

metric spectra, even if the annulus contains supersymmetric characters, since bosons and
fermions are treated dierently by m. thus, the 5353 sector contributes a gauge group
usp(8)4, with weyl spinors in the (28, 1, 1, 1) and in three additional permutations, and

chiral multiplets in the (8, 8, 1, 1) and in ve additional permutations. finally, the strings

stretched between a brane and an antibrane have non-supersymmetric spectra, with weyl

spinors and complex scalars in the representations

the choice (1, 2, 3) = (  ) also corresponds to a model with discrete torsion. in this
case, however, there are d9 branes and three sets of d5 branes, while the charges are to

be parametrized as

no = a + b + c + d ,

nf = a  b + c  d ,

ng = a + b  c  d ,

nh = a  b  c + d ,

dg;o = o1 + g1 + o1 + g1 ,

dh;f = i(o3  g3  o3 + g3) ,

dh;h = o3  g3 + o3  g3 .

(2.20)

the d9 branes have n = 1 supersymmetry, with gauge group so(8)4 and chiral mul-
tiplets in the (8, 8, 1, 1) and ve permutations. moreover, each antibrane gives a non-

supersymmetric spectrum, with gauge group u(8)  u(8), chiral multiplets in the (8, 8),
(8, 8) and in their conjugates, spinors in the (28, 1), (28, 1), (1, 28), (1, 28) and complex

scalars in the (36, 1), (36, 1), (1, 36), (1, 36). we would like to stress that in this case the

gauginos are massless, since the mobius amplitude does not aect the adjoint representa-

tions of unitary groups. finally, 5k5l sectors give chiral multiplets in the representations

all chiral spectra thus obtained are free of non-abelian anomalies.

on the other hand, the models without discrete torsion are not chiral. the choice

(1, 2, 3) = (+ + +), discussed in [8] and worked out in detail in [24], leads to a gauge

group usp(16)4. another model, without discrete torsion but with two d5 branes, can be

14

obtained letting two of the k be negative. the d9 and d5 branes give orthogonal gauge
groups with n = 1 supersymmetry, while the two d5 branes give symplectic gauge groups
with no supersymmetry. for instance, with the choice (+  )

(2.21)

and there are no breaking terms in the annulus. after a suitable rescaling of the charge

multiplicities, the d52 and the d53 branes give non-supersymmetric spectra, with usp(16)

gauge groups, spinors in the 136 and in three copies of the 120 and scalars in the 120 and

in two copies of the 136. the 99 and 5151 sectors have n = 1 supersymmetry, gauge group
so(16) and chiral multiplets in the 136 and in two copies of the 120. finally, there are two

chiral multiplets in the representation (16, 16) arising from the 951 and the 5253 sectors and

complex scalars and weyl spinors in bifundamental representations arising from the 952,

953, 5152 and 5153 sectors.

the fact that the z2  z2 orientifold with discrete torsion naturally leads to non-
supersymmetric spectra can also be argued considering f-theory on the t 8/z2z2z2 with
discrete torsion [25], since the blow-up of this eight-dimensional orbifold is only birational

to a calabi-yau fourfold 1.

2.2. comments on freely acting z2  z2 orientifolds with brane supersymmetry breaking

in all the models discussed in [14], one can introduce d5 branes simply reverting some

signs in the twisted sectors of the klein bottle, as in the previous case. this procedure

1we would like to thank zurab kakushadze and koushik ray for calling this correspondence to our

attention.

generates models with branes, antibranes and various amounts of supersymmetry. for

instance, the p23 model of [14], with 1

2-momentum shifts along the last two tori, can be

turned into a dierent model, described by

the 99 sector gives a gauge group so(16  a)  so(a)  so(16  c)  so(c), with n =
1 supersymmetry and chiral multiplets in the representation (16  a, a, 1, 1) and in ve
additional ones diering by permutations of the entries. the 5151 sector gives a gauge

group usp(8) usp(8), with complex scalars in the (36, 1) and (1, 36), weyl spinors in two
copies of the (28, 1) and (1, 28), and one n = 2 hypermultiplet in the (8, 8). finally, the 951
sector gives weyl spinors in the representations (16a, 1, 1, 1; 8, 1), (1, a, 1, 1; 8, 1), (1, 1, 16
c, 1; 1, 8), (1, 1, 1, c; 1, 8) and complex scalars in the representations (16  a, 1, 1, 1; 1, 8),
(1, a, 1, 1; 1, 8), (1, 1, 16c, 1; 8, 1), (1, 1, 1, c; 8, 1). in the decompactication limit r2, r3 
, local tadpole cancellation requires a further breaking of the d5 gauge group to usp(4)4,
and the resulting conguration may be linked to the z2 orientifold discussed in [10].

3. open descendants of the t 6/z4 orbifold

16

the z4 orbifold is obtained identifying the complex world-sheet coordinates x a on the
three internal tori and the world-sheet fermions a according to x a  ax a, a  aa,
where a = e2ita (a = 1, 2, 3) and the twist vector has components (t1, t2, t3) = ( 1
4 , 1
2).
in order to display the contributions of the a, it is convenient to decompose the original

4, 1

level-one so(8) characters with respect to so(2)  so(2)  su(2)  u(1). to this end, we
introduce the two level-one su(2) characters (0, 1/2), of conformal weights (0, 1
4), and the

eight u(1) characters m (m = 0,1,2,3, 4) for a boson on a circle of radius r = 8,

of conformal weights hm = m2/16. the contribution of the a to the sector twisted by k

and projected by l, (k, l = 0, 1, 2, 3), can then be expressed as

kl = k0 + ilk1 + (1)lk2 + (i)lk3

,

(3.1)

where the characters kl are collected in appendix b, while the contributions of the internal

(lattice) bosons are

before the  projection, the massless sector describes n = 2 supergravity coupled to 7
vector multiplets and 32 hypermultiplets, and can thus be associated with the singular

limit of a calabi-yau manifold with hodge numbers (h11, h21) = (31, 7).

where, as in the previous cases, we have inserted a sign  = 1 in front of the twisted
contributions. the choice  = 1 gives the usual  projection, while the choice  = 1 inverts
the charge of the o5 plane and, as in the previous examples, requires the introduction of

antibranes. in the transverse channel, this amplitude turns into

reveals the presence of a term proportional to 1/v3. for  = 1, this gives rise to a massless

tadpole that can not be canceled by the annulus and mobius contributions. for  = 1,
however, this term becomes massive, and one can complete the construction of the open

descendants without any further diculties.

in this case, the projected massless closed

spectrum is n = 1 supergravity coupled to 6 vector multiplets and 33 chiral multiplets.
for the open sector, it is convenient to introduce a compact notation, as in the previous

section, dening

and denoting by

it should be appreciated that the structure of the breaking terms is consistent with eq.

(2.12). thus, in the sector twisted by 2 they are

(s + 4sd)2 + 15s2 = 16s2 + 16s2

since the branes are present only in one xed torus, while in the sector twisted by  (or

as usual, the coecients in m are xed by factorization in the tube channel. some sign am-

interpretation. the latter calls for the parametrization

while the tadpole conditions select the gauge group so(8)9  so(8)9  u(8)9  usp(8)5 
usp(8)5  u(8)5. the d9 spectrum has n = 1 supersymmetry, with two chiral multiplets
in the (8, 1, 8) and in the (1, 8, 8) representations, and one chiral multiplet in each of the

(1, 1, 28), (1, 1, 28) and (8, 8, 1) representations. on the other hand, the d5 spectrum is not

supersymmetric, and contains, aside from the corresponding gauge bosons, spinors in the

(28, 1, 1), (1, 28, 1), (1, 1, 64), (1, 1, 28), (1, 1, 28), complex scalars in the (1, 1, 36), (1, 1, 36),

and chiral multiplets in the (8, 8, 1) and in two copies of the (8, 1, 8) and (1, 8, 8). finally,

the nd strings contain complex scalars in the (8, 1, 1; 8, 1, 1), (1, 8, 1; 1, 8, 1), (1, 1, 8; 1, 1, 8)

and (1, 1, 8; 1, 1, 8), and weyl spinors in the (8, 1, 1; 1, 1, 8), (1, 1, 8; 1, 8, 1), (1, 8, 1; 1, 1, 8)

and (1, 1, 8; 8, 1, 1). this spectrum is chiral, but is free of irreducible gauge anomalies. as

in previous examples, if suitable diagonal subgroups of the d5 factors are regarded as global

symmetries, the d9 spectrum has n = 1 supersymmetry.

21

4. type i vacua with branes and antibranes of the same type

in the previous examples we have seen how the structure of the closed sector determines

both the types and the total numbers of d-branes present in the open descendants. in these

cases, the breaking of supersymmetry on the branes is directly enforced by the consistency

of the model.

somewhat dierent scenarios have been recently proposed in [17, 18, 20]. in the resulting

models, a supersymmetric open sector is deformed allowing for the simultaneous presence of

branes and antibranes of the same type. whereas tadpole conditions only x the total rr

charge, the option of saturating it by a single type of d-brane, whenever available, stands

out as the only one compatible with space-time supersymmetry. however, if one relaxes

this last condition, there are no evident obstructions to considering vacuum congurations

where branes and antibranes with a xed total rr charge are simultaneously present. the

rules for constructing this wider class of models can be simply presented referring to a

ten-dimensional example.

the starting point is the familiar supersymmetric type iib torus amplitude

t = |v8  s8|2

,

and the corresponding klein bottle projection

k =

1
2

(v8  s8)

.

in the transverse channel, the latter becomes

k =

25
2

(v8  s8)

,

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

and requires an open sector with a net number of 32 branes in order to cancel the resulting

rr tadpole. actually, both v8 and s8 develop tadpoles in this case, that in the usual

type i model are related by supersymmetry, but are conceptually quite dierent. while

22

ns-ns tadpoles result in redenitions of the vacuum conguration, rr tadpoles signal in

general genuine inconsistencies, and their presence is a symptom of the emergence of serious

pathologies [6].

actually, one can conceive a more general construction in this case [17], allowing in the

transverse-channel annulus dierent reection coecients for the v8 and s8 characters, so

that

a =

25

2 h(n+ + n)2 v8  (n+  n)2 s8i ,

(4.4)

where n+ and n actually count the total numbers of d9 and d9 branes.

it should be

appreciated how their relative minus sign in the coecient of s8 accounts neatly for their

opposite rr charges, while they have clearly identical couplings to the graviton, consis-

tently with the coecient of v8. the direct-channel annulus amplitude

+ + n2
n2


2

a =

(v8  s8) + n+n (o8  c8)

(4.5)

reects the opposite gso projections for open strings stretched between two d-branes of

the same type (99 or 99) and of dierent types (99 or 99) [21]. while the former yields

the supersymmetric type i spectrum, the latter eliminates the vector and its spinorial

superpartners, while retaining the tachyon and the spinor of opposite chirality. as a result,

supersymmetry is broken and an instability, signaled by the presence of the tachyonic

ground state, emerges.

the mobius amplitude

m = 

1
2

(n+ + n) v8 +

1
2

(n+  n) s8

(4.6)

now involves naturally an undetermined sign for v8, whose tadpole is generally incompatible

with the one of s8, and is to be relaxed. together with a, the two signs lead to symplectic or
orthogonal gauge groups with s fermions in (anti)symmetric representations and tachyons

and c fermions in bi-fundamentals.

23

in these ten-dimensional models, the only way to eliminate the tachyon consists in

introducing only d9-branes. depending on the signs in the mobius amplitude, one thus

recovers either the so(32) superstring or the usp(32) model of [17]. on the other hand,

more can be done if one compacties the theory on some internal manifold. in this case,

one can introduce wilson lines (or, equivalently, separate the branes) in such a way that in

the open strings stretched between separate 9 and 9 branes the tachyon actually becomes

massive. it is instructive to analyze in some detail the simple case of circle compactication.

as in the previous example, the klein bottle amplitude is not aected, and is given by

k =

1
2

(v8  s8) p ,

(4.7)

where p denotes the sum over momentum states. however, the wilson line aects the

annulus amplitude, that in the transverse-channel now reads

a =

25

2 h(n+ + (1)nn)2 v8  (n+  (1)nn)2 s8i w ,

(4.8)

where (1)nw denotes an oscillating winding sum. as a result, in the direct channel
amplitude

+ + n2

2

a =

where p (1/2) denotes a sum over 1

(v8  s8) p + n+n (o8  c8) p (1/2) ,
2-shifted momentum states, both the tachyon and the c

(4.9)

spinor are lifted. the open sector is completed by the mobius amplitude

m =

1

2 h(n+ + n) v8 + (n+  n) s8i p ,

(4.10)

and at the massless level comprises gauge bosons in the adjoint of so(n+)  so(n) (or
usp(n+)  usp(n), depending on the sign of v8 in m) and s spinors in (anti)symmetric
representations.

4.1. toroidal compactications with nine and ve (anti)branes

let us now turn to six-dimensional toroidal compactications. in this case, one has the

interesting option to introduce in the standard type i model of [26] pairs of d5d5 and

24

d9d9 branes. the result includes a chiral spectrum conned to the (non-supersymmetric)

branes, and calls for the introduction of six-dimensional green-schwarz couplings to the

single tensor present in the projected closed spectrum to cancel the residual gauge and

mixed anomalies.

the starting point in this construction is the standard type iib string compactied on

a four-torus, for which

t = |v8  s8|2 4 = |v4o4 + o4v4  c4c4  s4s4|2 4 .

(4.11)

one can now add the standard klein bottle projection

k =

1
2

(v8  s8) p 4 =

1
2

(v4o4 + o4v4  c4c4  s4s4) p 4 ,

(4.12)

where, for later convenience, we have explicitly decomposed the so(8) characters into

products of so(4) ones. the transverse-channel annulus amplitude

a =

is somewhat unconventional, and thus deserves some comments. actually, the 99, 99, 99,

55, 55 and 55 contributions have already been discussed previously and do not need further

explanations, but one should notice the presence of wilson lines (brane displacements)

in the 99 (55) sectors. these are to aect dierent directions, and are needed to lift the

tachyons that would otherwise be present in the open spectrum. the transverse-channel
amplitude a, however, includes additional mixed terms, absent in ordinary toroidal con-
structions, that are to be interpreted as orbifold-like projections. in fact, the simultaneous

25

presence of 9 and 5-branes, a familiar feature of orbifold models, halves the number of su-

persymmetries and results in the corresponding (z2) breaking of the characters v8 and s8.

of course, due to the simultaneous presence of branes and antibranes, the complete theory

is not supersymmetric, as implied by the dierent signs in the rr sectors. the orbifold-like

structure of the annulus amplitude can be better appreciated after an s transformation to

the direct-channel amplitude

(n+d + nd+) .

(n+d+ + nd)

(4.14)

while the mixed nd terms have the structure familiar from z2 orbifolds, no breaking terms

are actually present in this case both for n and d charges. this is precisely as demanded

by the consistency conditions for open-string constructions, since only the toroidal bulk

states are allowed to propagate in the transverse channel.

one can now derive the transverse-channel mobius amplitude combining the terms in

k and a at the origin of the lattices, so that

(4.16)

the rr tadpole conditions demand that the net charge of the d9/d9-branes, n+ n, be
equal to 32, and that the numbers of d5 and d5 branes be the same. it is then impossible to

satisfy the ns-ns tadpoles, and as a result a potential is generated for the six-dimensional

dilaton, 6, and for the volume v of the internal torus:

ve  e6"(n+ + n + 32)v +

(d+ + d)

v

# .

(4.17)

this potential has the peculiar property of stabilizing the internal volume to the value

v0 =

d+ + d

n+ + n + 32

,

(4.18)

while giving a mass to the corresponding (breathing-mode) eld. this feature is common

to all models with 9, 9, 5 and 5 branes that we shall encounter in the following sections.

follows from (4.15) after one includes the massive contributions and performs a p trans-

formation. the massless open spectrum depends on the sign , that is not xed by tadpole

conditions. for  = 1, it comprises gauge bosons in the adjoint of so(n+)9  so(n)9

where s (a) and f denote the (anti)symmetric and fundamental representations. on the

other hand, for  = +1 symmetric and antisymmetric representations are interchanged in

the bosonic sector (thus also interchanging orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups), while

the massless closed states, still supersymmetric, ll the n = (1, 1) supergravity multiplet.
it should be appreciated that, to lowest order, after a toroidal compactication to four
dimensions, for  = +1 ( = 1) the spectrum on the d9 and d5 (d9 and d5) branes has
n = 2 supersymmetry, if suitable gauge subgroups for the d9 and d5 (d9 and d5) branes
are regarded as global symmetries. thus, to lowest order the resulting massless spectrum

has n = 4 supersymmetry in the bulk, n = 2 supersymmetry on the branes (antibranes),
while it is not supersymmetric on the antibranes (branes). the open sector is chiral and

leads to residual mixed and gauge anomalies, summarized by the polynomial

i8 =

(4.20)

and removed by green-schwarz couplings [27] involving the single antisymmetric tensor

present in the massless closed spectrum, while the rr tadpole conditions guarantee the

cancellation of all irreducible trr4 and trf 4 anomalies.

one can further deform these spectra, allowing for a non-trivial quantized ns-ns bij

of rank r. due to the peculiar structure of the models, the closed sector behaves as in

standard toroidal compactications [26], whereas the annulus amplitude, modied as in

[28], in the transverse channel reads

is thus xed by factorization and, as usual, involves the signs  that enforce a proper

2r/2 and, after a modular transformation to the direct channel, 2r/2 copies of the nd

sectors are present, while the  allow for continuous interpolations between orthogonal

and symplectic gauge groups only on the d9 and d9 branes.

4.2. the t 4/z2 orbifold revisited

let us now reconsider the open descendants of the t 4/z2 orbifold, allowing for the

simultaneous presence of branes and antibranes of the same type. for the sake of clarity,

let us begin from the torus amplitude

where we have used the standard z2 decompositions

qo = v4o4  c4c4 ,

qv = o4v4  s4s4 ,

qs = o4c4  s4o4 ,

qc = v4s4  c4v4 .

(4.25)

we have written k in this form, since one can actually modify the klein bottle projec-
tion for twisted closed states, as in [10]. multiple klein-bottle projections, rst discussed in

[23], have also interesting physical applications to tachyon-free non-supersymmetric open-

string models [29]. the choice  = +1 corresponds to the usual t 4/z2 orientifold, and gives

a closed unoriented spectrum containing n = (1, 0) supergravity coupled to 20 hypermulti-
plets and 1 tensor multiplet, while the choice  = 1 gives n = (1, 0) supergravity coupled
to 4 hypermultiplets and 17 tensor multiplets.

one can anticipate the need for a net number of 32 d9 and 32 (anti)d5-branes (for  = 1,

lowing [18] we have inserted the d5 and d5-branes at dierent xed points of the orbifolds,

and we have added wilson lines for the d9-branes along a dierent coordinate.

the 99 and 55 sectors are supersymmetric, and comprise vector multiplets in the adjoint of

u(n+)9  u(n)9  u(d+)5  u(d)5, together with hypermultiplets in the antisymmetric
and conjugate antisymmetric representations. on the other hand, the 99 and 55 are not

supersymmetric and contain left-handed weyl fermions in the antisymmetric and conjugate

antisymmetric representations, and a quartet of real scalars in the symmetric and conju-

gate symmetric representations. finally, the 95 and 95 sectors give hypermultiplets in the

(n+ , d+) and (n , d), respectively, while the 95 and 95 sectors, evidently not supersym-

metric, give a quartet of scalars in the (n+ , d), (n , d+) and right-handed weyl fermions
in the (n+ , d), (n , d+). the irreducible gravitational and gauge anomalies vanish as a

result of tadpole conditions, whereas the residual anomaly polynomial

in the present models discrete deformations for the ns-ns b-eld may be introduced

as in [26, 28], and result in a reduced total rr charge for nine and ve (anti)branes and

in multiplicities for the nd sectors. moreover, the corresponding signs in the mobius

amplitude allow continuous interpolations between orthogonal (symplectic) and unitary

gauge groups.

as a last example, we would like to generalize the non-supersymmetric t 6/z4 orbifold

of section 3, allowing for the simultaneous presence of branes and antibranes. as in the

previous examples, the torus and klein bottle amplitudes are not aected, whereas the

charges by n, d and by their orbifold-induced breakings r, s and t . the z4 action

suggests the parametrization

rn = n + im  p  i m , rd = q + ir  s  ir ,

sn = n  m + p  m ,

scalars in the representations (n+, q), (p+, s), (m+, r) and ( m+, r), and spinors in

the representations (n+, r), (p+, r), (m+, s) and ( m+, q), while the 59 sector contains

chiral multiplets in the representations (n+, r+), (p+, r+), (m+, s+) and ( m+, q+). finally,

the 59 and 59 sectors give similar contributions, with suitable relabelings of the chan-paton

charges. this chiral spectrum is free of non-abelian gauge anomalies.

5. conclusions

in this paper we have discussed type i models where the basic two-dimensional con-

sistency conditions (rr tadpoles), although apparently unsolvable, can actually be solved

provided supersymmetry is broken at the string scale on some (anti)branes, while some

amount of supersymmetry is left, to lowest order, on other branes, and most notably in the

bulk (gravitational) sector.

this new feature of our mechanism (called in [10] brane supersymmetry breaking), where

the breaking is tied to the string scale, is the main dierence compared to other previously

known mechanisms in heterotic strings [11], in type i strings [12, 14, 15, 33, 13, 34] or

in m-theory [35]. brane supersymmetry breaking is typically accompanied by uncanceled

ns-ns tadpoles for the dilaton at some moduli elds of the compact manifold.

since our models contain non-bps brane-antibrane systems, one might wonder whether

they correspond to stable congurations. this is indeed the case, and actually the min-

imal d9-d5 pairs of [10], aside from having no open-string tachyons, experience no net

mutual forces, as can be seen from the vanishing of the corresponding annulus amplitude.

following [17, 18], these models can be further deformed by the inclusion of additional

brane-antibrane pairs of the same type (d9-d9, d5i-d5i). we would like to stress that this

additional deformation is an interesting option, not required by any rr tadpole conditions.

rather, it destroys local tadpole cancellations, while the new brane-antibrane pairs do expe-

rience mutual forces, although the tachyons resulting from strings stretched between them

37

may be lifted if the endpoints are suitably separated in the internal space. interestingly, the

ns-ns tadpoles resulting from the various mutual interactions between (anti)branes and

orientifold planes determine a scalar potential that can actually stabilize some of the radii

of the compact space, giving masses to the corresponding elds. large (small) volumes,

however, require unnaturally large numbers of d5-d5 (d9-d9) pairs, whose presence, there-

fore, asks for a dynamical reason. since the whole approach is perturbative, the dilaton

potential has, not surprisingly, a runaway behavior towards vanishing string coupling. we

would like to stress that all these constructions, despite their attractive features, do not

solve the problem of the (four-dimensional) cosmological constant.

breaking supersymmetry at the string scale is a viable phenomenological alternative

if our world is a non-supersymmetric (anti)brane and the string scale mi is in the tev

range, or if our world is on a brane that, to lowest order, is supersymmetric. in the latter

case, supersymmetry breaking could be mediated by gauge interactions, and a realistic

spectrum would ask for a string scale of the order of 100 tev if the non-supersymmetric

(anti)brane gauge coupling were of order one, or at an intermediate value if the (anti)brane

gauge coupling were suppressed by the volume of the internal space. alternatively, if

this coupling were very tiny, gravitation would mediate supersymmetry breaking with an

intermediate string scale of the order of 1011 gev [5]. the (tree-level) supersymmetry

present in the bulk sector can have far-reaching physical consequences. indeed, quantum

corrections to brane/antibrane couplings can also be interpreted in terms of eective brane

couplings to bulk elds. if these respect the bulk symmetry, one could contemplate the

fascinating possibility of living in a non-supersymmetric world where quantum corrections

are governed by a supersymmetric bulk sector. in this case, the gauge hierarchy would be

protected and the quantum corrections would be very similar to those of a supersymmetric

brane theory. we will return to these interesting issues in the near future.
