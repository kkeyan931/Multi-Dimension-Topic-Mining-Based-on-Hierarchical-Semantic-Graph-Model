abstract

in ref.[1], schwinger terms in hamiltonian quantization
of chiral fermions coupled to vector potentials were com-
puted, using some ideas from the theory of gerbes, with
the help of the family index theorem for a manifold with
boundary. here, we generalize this method to include grav-
itational schwinger terms.

1

introduction

chiral anomalies in quantum eld theory appear in several dier-
ent forms. historically they were rst observed in perturbative

calculations of certain 1-loop scattering amplitudes, as a breaking
of the (classically valid) chiral symmetry, [2]. later nonperturba-
tive methods were developed for understanding the chiral symme-

try breaking in the euclidean path integral formalism, [3],[4]. it was
also understood that even the symmetry under coordinate transfor-

mations could be broken when quantizing massless fermions.

in the hamiltonian approach to chiral anomalies one considers

the equal time commutation relations for the innitesimal gener-
ators of the classical symmetry group. first one constructs the

1

2

bundle of fermionic fock spaces parametrized by various external
(classical) elds: gauge potentials, metrics, scalar potentials etc.

the quantization of the algebra of currents in the fock spaces re-
quires some renormalization procedure. in 1 + 1 space-time dimen-

sions usually a normal ordering is sucient but in higher dimensions
certain additional subtractions are needed. typically the renormal-

ization modies the algebra of classical symmetries by the so-called
schwinger terms, [5].

in 1 + 1 dimensions the schwinger term is normally just a c-

number, leading to an ane lie algebra (gauge transformations)
or to the virasoro algebra (dieomorphisms). in higher dimensions

the algebra is more complicated; instead of a central (c-number)
extension the schwinger terms lead to an extension by an abelian

ideal [6]. direct analytic computations of the schwinger terms in
higher dimensions, although they can be carried out [7] in the

yang-mills case, are very complicated in the case of an external
gravitational eld. however, there are topological and geometrical
methods which give directly the structure of the quantized current

algebra. as in the case of euclidean path integral anomalies, a
central ingredient in this discussion is the families index theorem.

in a previous paper [1] (see also [8] for a review) it was shown
how the schwinger terms in the gauge current algebra are related,

via atiyah-patodi-singer index theory, to the structure of a system
of local determinant line bundles in odd dimensions. this system
provides an example of a mathematical structure called a bundle

gerbe, [9].

in the present paper we want to extend the methods of [1] for

constructing the schwinger terms which arise in fermionic fock
space quantization of the algebra of vector elds on an odd di-

mensional manifold.

3

in section 2 we set up the notation and recall some basic re-
sults in the families index theory in case of compact manifolds with

boundaries. in section 3 we compute the curvature forms for a lo-
cal system of complex line bundles over a parameter space b which

consists of gauge potentials and riemannian metrics. in section 4
we explain how the schwinger terms in the fock space quantiza-

tion of vector elds (and innitesimal gauge transformations) are
obtained from the local curvature formulas. finally, in section 5 we
give some results of explicit computations of the schwinger terms.

2 the family index theorem

let  : m  b be a smooth bre bundle with bres dieomor-
phic to a compact oriented spin manifold m of even dimension 2n.
assume that each bre mz = 1(z), z  b, is equipped with a
riemannian metric. assume further that m is equipped with a
connection. this means that at each point x  m , the tangent
space splits in a horizontal and a vertical part: tx m = hx  vx,
where vx consists of vectors tangential to the bers.

let e be a vector bundle over m which along each ber mz
is the tensor product ez of the dirac spinor bundle over mz (with
cliord action of the vertical vectors vx) and a nite dimensional
vector bundle wz (with trivial cliord multiplication).
it has a
z2 structure provided by the chirality operator  according to:
c() = 1 on e , where c denotes the cliord action.

e is assumed to be equipped with a hermitean ber metric. this
naturally induces an l2-metric in the space of sections (mz, ez).
finally, let d be an operator on ( m, e) which is berwise dened
as a family of dirac operators dz : (mz, ez)  (mz, ez) with
z  b. with a dirac operator we mean an operator that can be

4

written as the sum of compositions of a covariant derivative and a
cliord multiplication.

we would now like to apply the family index theorem to the case
described above. before doing this, some additional assumptions

is needed. these are of dierent nature depending on if m has a
non-empty boundary or not. when the boundary is empty, it will
only be assumed that the set {dz}zb should consist of self-adjoint
dirac operators. the assumptions in the more dicult case of a
non-empty boundary m will now be described.

z ) can be written as ct( 

we make the common simplifying assumption that for all z  b,
there exists a collar neighbourhood of mz such that all structures
in ez are of product type (see ref. [10]). this implies that d+
z =
d|(mz,e +
z ) near the boundary, where
ct is the cliord multiplication by an element corresponding to the
coordinate vector eld 
t (which is along the unit inward normal
vector eld at the boundary) and d
z is a self-adjoint dirac operator
on e +|mz . our conventions are such that ct is unitary.

t + d

let indd, be the family {inddz,}zu, where indd = kerd+
kerd is the index bundle in the sense of k-theory and u = {z 

b;  / spec(cid:0)d

z will be restricted to {  (mz, e 

z(cid:1)}. the notation means that every operator d+

z
will be restricted to the domain {  (mz, e +
z ; pz,|mz = 0},
while d
z ; (1  pz,)ct|mz =
0}, where pz, is the spectral projection of d
z corresponding to
eigenvalues  . we will assume that the dirac operators dz, are
self-adjoint.

the family index theorem has been proven in [11] when m = 

and in [12], based on [10], when m 6= . it reads:

ch (indd) (z) = zmz
ch (indd) (z) = zmz

a(mz)ch(wz),

m = 

a(mz)ch(wz) 

1
2

(z), z  u, m 6= ,

where

a(mz) = det1/2(cid:18) irz/4

sinh(irz/4)(cid:19)

ch(wz) = tr exp (ifz/2) .

5

(1)

we choose to not write down the denitions of the form  or the
curvature 2-forms r and f in m, where rz = r|mz and fz = f |mz,
since we will only need their explicit expression in a simple special
case. the only thing about the  form we need to know later is that
it depends only on the boundary spectral data. the zero degree

part of  is just the -invariant of the boundary dirac operator.

z and kerd

z )  det ker d

for m = , the determinant line bundle det is an object
it is a line bundle
closely related with the index bundle indd.
over b, bre-wise dened as (det kerd+
z . to dene
it globally over b we must also account for that the dimension of
kerd+
z can jump as z varies. for a detailed construction,
see [13]. for m 6=  there exist a similar construction of a bundle
det over u, closely related to indd, see ref. [14]. in [13] and
[14] it has been shown that for m =  and m 6=  there exists
a connection on det and det, respectively, naturally associated
with the quillen metric, [15], with curvature given by

i

where [2] denotes the part that is a 2-form. notice that the 2-form

part of the right hand side of the family index theorem, eq. (1), is
equal to the right hand side of eq. (2).

in the case of an odd dimensional manifold n one can produce
in a similar way an element   h 3(b, z), by an integration over

6

the bers nz,

(z) = (cid:18)znz

where this time we pick up the component of the form which is

of degree 3 in the tangential directions on the parameter space b.
this form plays an important role in the hamiltonian quantization

of external eld problems, [1]. it is the dixmier-douady class of a
gerbe. a nonvanishing dixmier-douady class is an obstruction to

quantizing chiral fermions in a gauge invariant manner.

3 local line bundles over boundary

geometries

let p be a xed principal g bundle over m with a projection  :
p  m and f m the oriented frame bundle of m. the bundle f m
is a also a principal bundle, with the structure group gl+(2n, r),
the group of real 2n  2n matrices with positive determinant. let
q denote the product bundle p  f m. let b = a  m where
a is the ane space of connections on p and m is the space of
riemannian metrics on m. locally, an element of a is written as a
lie(g) valued 1-form on m. we may view q as a principal bundle
q over m = m  b in a natural way, as the pull-back under the
projection m  b  m.

with notations as in the previous section we dene mz as the
manifold m with metric given by z  b. along the model ber
m, let e be the tensor product of the dirac spinor bundle and a
vector bundle w over m, the latter being an associated bundle to
p (m, g). we view e in a natural way as a vector bundle e over
m  b. finally, we let dz : (mz, ez)  (mz, ez) be the dirac
operator constructed from z  b in the usual way; in terms of a

7

local coordinates a = adx,  = dx, and with respect to a
local orthonormal frame {ea}2n

a=1 of t mz we have

d(a,) =

2n

xa,=1

aea

 ( + a + ) ,

s are the components of the basis vectors ea in the
where the ea
coordinate frame and a is the cliord multiplication by ea, with
ab + ba = 2ab.

let d be the group of orientation preserving dieomorphims of
m and g the group of gauge transformations in p, i.e., the group
of automorphims of p (m, g) which projects to the identity map on
the base. the groups g and d act through pull-backs on a and m.
the group actions induce a ber structure in b = a  m but in
order to obtain smooth moduli spaces we restrict to the subgroups
g0  g and d0  d. the former is the group of based gauge
transformations  leaving invariant some xed base point p0  p,
(p0) = p0. the group d0 is dened as

d0 = {  d|(x0) = x0 and tx0 = id}

for some xed x0  m. with these choices, we obtain the smooth
ber bundles m  m/d0 and a  a/g0. this leads also to a
bering b = a m  (a m)/(d0  g0). note that the group of
symmetries is the semidirect product of d0 and g0 since locally an
element of g0 is a g-valued function on m and the dieomorphisms
act on the argument of the function.

following [16] we have a connection form  on q = p  f m 
b  m  b which can be pushed forward to a connection form on
q/(d0  g0). along p  f m the form  is given by a connection
a  a and by the levi-civita connection given by a metric g  m.
restricted to the second factor b = a  m the form  is called

8

the brst ghost and will be denoted by v. since the total form 
should vanish along gauge and dieomorphism directions it follows

that its value along these directions in b is uniquely determined by
the value of the corresponding vector eld on p  f m.

in the case of gauge potentials, b = a, an innitesimal gauge
transformation is given locally as a lie(g) valued function z on m
and then vp,a(za) = z(x) where x = (p) and za = za is the
vector eld on a dened by the innitesimal gauge transformation
z. in the case of dieomorphims, z is the gl(2n, r) valued function

dened as the jacobian (in local coordinates) of a vector eld on m.
again, v(z) is the tautological 1-form, z evaluated at a point x 
m. the ghost v in other directions is a nonlocal expression involving
the greens function of a gauge covariant laplacian, [16, 17], but we

shall make explicit use of v only in the gauge and dieomorphims
directions.

next let n be an odd dimensional manifold without boundary
and let m = [0, 1]n, dimm = 2n. given a principal bundle p over
n we can extend it to a principal bundle over m (to be denoted

by the same symbol p ) by a pull-back dened by the projection
[0, 1]  n  n. we choose a xed connection a0 in the principal
bundle p over n and a xed metric g0 in n. if a is an arbitrary
connection in p we form a connection a(t) (with t  [0, 1]) in the
principal bundle p over m by

a(t) = (1  f (t))a0 + f (t)a,

where f is a xed smooth real valued function such that f (0) =

0, f (1) = 1, and all the derivatives of f vanish at the end points
t = 0, 1. similarly, any metric g in n denes a metric in m such

that along n directions it is given by

gij(t) = (1  f (t))(g0)ij + f (t)gij

9

and such that t is a normalized vector eld in t direction, or-
thogonal to the n directions. however, for computations below it

is more convenient to use directly a homotopy connecting the the
levi-civita connection  (constructed from the metric g) to the
connection 0 (constructed from g0). the formula for this homo-
topy is the same as for the gauge potentials above.

we use the russian formula, which is just an expression of
the fact that in a principal bundle with a connection the curvature
form has no components along ber directions. the formula tells
that when the total curvature on p  f m  a  m is evaluated
along vertical directions in am  (am)/(g0 d0) and along
vector elds on p  f m the result is

f  = f a, = da +

[a, a] + d +

[, ],

where  is the levi-civita connection.

next we replace  = a +  + v by the time dependent connec-

tion

(t) = (1  f (t))(a0 + 0) + f (t)(a +  + v).

an evaluation of the curvature of a dirac determinant bundle over
a  m involves an integration of a characteristic class pn+1(f (t))
over m = [0, 1]  n and an evaluation of the  form on the bound-
ary. here pi denotes a generic homogeneous symmetric invariant
polynomial of degree i in the curvature.

actually we have to restrict the construction of the determinant
bundle to subsets u in the parameter space b on the boundary.
here u is again the set of those points in b such that the associated
dirac operator on m does not have the eigenvalue . these sets
form an open cover of b. in each of the sets u one can dene the 
form associated to dirac operators dz   as a continuous function
of the parameters z  b.

10

we shall restrict to the problem of determining the curvature
along gauge and dieomorphism directions on the boundary. the

 form is a spectral invariant and therefore the only term which
contributes is the appropriate characteristic class in the bulk m.

the integration of the index density in the bulk can be per-
formed in two steps. first one integrates over the time variable t

and then the resulting expression is integrated over n to produce a
2-form on a(n)m(n). all the computations involving the ghost
v are restricted to vertical directions.

restricting to the case of gauge potentials (calculations involv-
ing the levi-civita connections are performed in the same way) we

have

ij

f (t)
f (t)

0i

= iaj(t)  jai(t) + [ai(t), aj(t)]
= f (t)(a  a0)i,

where we use the index 0 for the t component. for intermediate
times 0 < t < 1 the curvature has components also to the vertical

directions,

(f (t))[0,2] =

1
2

f (f  1)[v, v]

(f (t))[1,1] = vf (t)dt + f (f  1)[a  a0, v].

here we have denoted by (f )[i,j] the component of a form f
which is of degree i in the tangential directions in p and of degree
j in the ghost v.

if pk is any homogeneous symmetric function of degree k of the

curvature we set pk(a, f ) = pk(a, f, f, . . . , f ) and then

pk(f (t)) = kzn z 1

(4)

11

the form on the right, when expanded in powers of the ghost
v, gives forms of various degrees on the parameter space b. we

are interested in the curvature form which is of degree 2 in v. the
degree zero part gives just the chern-simons form 2k1(a, a0)
and if n were an even dimensional manifold the degree 1 term
would be the nonabelian gauge anomaly.
in low dimensions one

gets familiar explicit formulas; as an example, consider the case of
a trivial bundle and a0 = 0. when n = 1 the relevant characteristic
class is p2(f ) = 1
2 )2tr f 2 and the curvature c1 along vector elds
given by a pair x, y of innitesimal gauge transformations on the

the case of levi-civita connection  needs some extra remarks.

the reason is that we have actually two types of chern-simons
forms (and associated anomaly forms) depending whether we write
the connection with respect to a (local) orthonormal frame in the

tangent bundle t m or with respect to the holonomic frame given
by coordinate vector elds.

formally, the two chern-simons forms (and associated poly-
nomials in v) look the same; they are given exactly by the same
dierential polynomials in 
a (with
respect to an anholonomic basis e
a). the dierence is (locally) an
exterior derivative of a form (in n) of lower degree. the dierence
 of the chern-simons forms involves the matrix function e
a(x)

 (coordinate basis) or in b

12

on n. since this function takes values in the group gl(2n  1, r),
which topologically is equivalent to so(2n  1), there might be a
topological obstruction for writing  globally as d for some form
. the potential obstruction is the winding number of the map
e : n  gl(2n  1, r), given by the (normalized) integral

w(e) =

1

(2n  1)! (cid:18) i

2(cid:19)n+1zn

tr (e1de)2n1.

the choice a

b in the anholonomic frame ea leads to dieomor-

phism invariant integralrn 2n1(a, a0) and there are no anomalies

or 2-forms along di(n) orbits in m. on the other hand, there is
a frame bundle anomaly related to local frame rotations; this takes
exactly the same form as the pure gauge anomaly discussed above,
[18].

the choice 
 in the coordinate frame is insensitive to the frame
rotations ea 7 e
a but it responds to a local change of coordinates.
explicit formulas for the forms c2n1 along din orbits are given
in the appendix.

4 schwinger terms from the local sys-

tem of line bundles

as we saw in the previous section, aps index theorem gives us a
system of local determinant bundles det over certain open sets
u  b. the innite-dimensional group k = d0  g0 acts in the
parameter space b mapping each of the subsets u onto itself. we
denote k = lie(k). in general, the determinant bundles are topo-
logically nontrivial and one cannot lift directly the action of k to
the total space of det. instead, there is a an extension k which
acts in the determinant bundles.

13

the lie algebra k of k is given in a standard way.

it con-
sists of pairs (x, ), where x  k and  is a function on b, with
commutation relations

[(x, ), (y, )] = ([x, y ], lx  ly  + c(x, y ; )),

where the schwinger term c is a purely imaginary function on b
and antisymmetric bilinear function on k. it is dened as the value
of the curvature of det at the given point in b along the vector
elds x, y on b. here lx denotes the lie derivative on b along
the vector eld x. the jacobi indentity in k is an immediate conse-
quence of the fact that the curvature is a closed 2-form on u  b.
let u = u  u. over u there is a natural complex line
bundle det such that the ber at a point z is the top exterior
power of the nite-dimensional vector space spanned by all eigen-
vectors of the dirac operator dz on n with eigenvalues in the range
 <  < . if  < , we set det = det
. by construction,
we have a natural isomorphism

det  det  det,

for all triples , , .

theorem 1 ([1]) for any pairs ,  of real numbers one has

det  det  det


over the set u.

note that even though in [1] the discussion was mainly around the
case of gauge potentials and gauge transformations, the proof of

the theorem was abstract and very general, not depending on the
particular type of parameter space for dirac operators.

14

in the gerbe terminology the content of this theorem is that the
gerbe dened by the system of local line bundles det is triv-
ial. the line bundles can be pushed forward to give a family of
local line bundles on b/k since the spectral subspaces transform
equivariantly under gauge transformations and changes of coordi-
nates. however, over b/k the gerbe is no more trivial, i.e., it
cannot be given as tensor products of local line bundles over the
sets pr(u), where pr : b  b/k is the canonical projection. the
obstruction to the trivialization is an element of h 3(b/k, z), the
dixmier- douady class of the gerbe. in [1] the dd class was com-
puted from the index theory in the case of yang-mills theory; the

generalization to the case involving metrics and dieomorphism is
straight-forward and the free part of the cohomology class is given
by the integral formula (3), with b replaced by b/k.

the importance of the above theorem comes from the following
simple observation. let hz = h+(z, )  h(z, ) be the spectral
decomposition of the fermionic 1-particle hilbert space with re-
spect to a spectral cut at   r, not in the spectrum of dz. this
determines a representation of the car algebra in a fock space
f (z, ), with a normalized vacuum vector |z,  > . the dening
property of this representation is that

a(u)|z,  >= 0 = a(u)|z,  >,

for u  h+(z, ) and u  h(z, ). all creation operators a(u)
and annihilation operators a(u) are anticommuting except

a(u)a(u) + a(u)a(u) =< u, u >,

where < ,  > is the inner product in hz. if we change the vacuum
level from  to  > , we have an isomorphism f (z, )  f (z, )
which is natural up to a multiplicative phase. the phase is xed by

15

a choice of normalized eigenvectors u1, u2, . . . up in the energy range
 < dz <  and setting |z,  >= a(u1) . . . a(up)|z,  > . but
this choice is exactly the same as choosing a (normalized) element
in det over the point z  b.

thus, setting fz = f (z, )  det(z) for any  not in the
spectrum of dz we obtain, according to theorem 1, a family of fock
spaces parametrized by points of b but which do not depend on
the choice of , [19]. this gives us a smooth fock bundle f over b.
the k action on the base lifts to a k action in f , the extension part
in k coming entirely from the action in the determinant bundles
det.

the schrodinger wave functions for quantized fermions in back-
ground elds (parametrized by points of b) are sections of the fock

bundle.
it follows that the schwinger terms for the innitesimal
generators of k, acting on schrodinger wave functions, are given
by the formula for c which describes the curvature of the determi-
nant bundle in the k directions. in the case of b = a and k = g,
the elements in the lie algebra are the gauss law generators. this

case was discussed in detail in [1]. more generally, we give explicit
formulas for the schwinger terms in section 5.

5 explicit computations

the schwinger term in (2n1)-dimensional space will now be com-
puted. this will be done by using notations for yang-mills, but it
works for dieomorphisms as well if a dierent symmetric invariant
polynomial is used. eq. (4) gives that

the schwinger term can be calculated from this expression. how-

ever, since we are only interested in the schwinger term up to a
coboundary, an alternative is to use the triangle formula as in
[20]:

2n+1(a + v, a0)  2n+1(a0 + v, a0) + 2n+1(a + v, a0 + v),

where  means equality up to a coboundary with respect to
d+, where  is the brst operator. this gives a simpler expression

for the non-integrated schwinger term and also for all other ghost
degrees of 2n+1(a + v, a0). straight forward computations gives
the result

this gives expressions for the non-integrated schwinger term in a

the gravitational schwinger terms are obtained by multiplying
with the normalization factor (i/2)1, inserting the integration
over n and evaluating on vector elds x and y on m generating
dieomorphisms. the levi-civita connection and curvature have
components ()i
ijj dxi  dxj. recall that
(v(x))i

j  = j x i, see, for instance, [18].

j  = ri

j  = i

to illustrate how the schwinger terms can be computed, we give

the result for 1 space dimension:

xy dx,

where  now means equality up to a coboundary with respect to
the brst operator.

when both a yang-mills eld and gravity are present, the rele-

vant polynomial is a sum of polynomial of type

pk(cid:0)f (t)(cid:1) pl(cid:0)r(t)(cid:1) ,

where the curvatures f (t) and r(t) are with respect to pure yang-
mills and pure gravity, respective. this gives

zm

pk(cid:0)f (t)(cid:1) pl(cid:0)r(t)(cid:1)

= zn z 1

+lpk(cid:0)f (f (t))(cid:1) pl(cid:0)h(t)( + v  0), r(h(t))(cid:1)idt.

the expression is independent of f and h (see below). with a
choice such that f (t) = 0, t  [1/2, 1] and h(t) = 0, t  [0, 1/2],
this implies that

zm

pk(cid:0)f (t)(cid:1) pl(cid:0)r(t)(cid:1) = zn

thus, the schwinger term in combined yang-mills and grav-
ity is up to a coboundary equal to the part of the expansion of

(5) that is of second ghost degree. in particular, this implies that
schwinger terms which have one yang-mills ghost and on dieo-

morphism ghost are in cohomology equal to the schwinger term
obtained from the form in (5). thus, truly mixed schwinger terms

do not exist. notice that if the background elds are vanishing
then the schwinger term is gravitational (although some parts of
the form degrees are taken up by the yang-mills polynomial). this

can give anomalies of virasoro typ in higher dimensions. observe
that there is nothing special about gravity, a yang-mills schwinger

term is obtained by interchanging the role of f and h. this does
however not mean that the gravitational schwinger term dier from

the yang-mills schwinger term by a coboundary. the terms with
k = 0 respective l = 0 ruin this argument.

it is easy to see that our method of computing the schwinger
term agrees with one of the most common approaches: the poly-
nomial pk(f n)  pk(f n
0 ) is written as (d + ) on a form, the (non-
integrated) chern-simons form. the schwinger term is the given by
the part of the chern-simons form that is quadratic in the ghost.

for the case when both yang-mills and gravity are present, the
relevant polynomial is a sum of polynomials

pk(f )pl(r)  pk(f0)pl(r0).

(6)

there is an ambiguity in the denition of the chern-simons

form; it is for instance possible to add forms of type (d + ) to it.
however, an ambiguity of this type will only change the schwinger

term by a coboundary. it will now be shown that the ambiguity
in the denition of the chern-simons form is only of this type.

thus, we must prove that closeness with respect to (d + ) implies
exactness. this can be done by introducing the degree 1 derivation

20

 dened on the generators by: (d + )(a + va) = a + va, (d +
)( + v) =  + v, da0 = a0, d0 = 0, and otherwise zero.
then (d + ) + (d + ) is a degree 0 derivation which is equal to
1 on the generators. therefore, if  is closed with respect to (d + ),
then  is proportional to (d + ).

an example of a (non-integrated) chern-simons form for the

polynomial in (6) is

2k1(a + va, a0)pl(r0) + pk(f )2l1( + v, 0).

this is in complete agreement with (5).
