abstract

an example of a non-abelian brane box model, namely one corresponding to a zk
dk orbifold singularity of c3, is constructed. its self-consistency and hence equivalence
to geometrical methods are subsequently shown.
it is demonstrated how a group-
theoretic twist of the non-abelian group circumvents the problem of inconsistency
that arise from nave attempts at the construction.

1 introduction

brane setups [1] have been widely attempted to provide an alternative to algebro-geometric
methods in the construction of gauge theories (see [2] and references therein). the advantages
of the latter include the enlightening of important properties of manifolds such as mirror
symmetry, the provision of convenient supergravity descriptions and in instances of pure
geometrical engineering, the absence of non-perturbative objects. the former on the other
hand, give intuitive and direct treatments of the gauge theory. one can conveniently read out
much information concerning the gauge theory from the brane setups, such as the dimension
of the coulomb and higgs branches [1], the mirror symmetry [1, 3, 4, 5] in 3 dimensions rst
shown in [6], the seiberg-duality in 4 dimensions [7], and exact solutions when we lift the
setups from type iia to m theory [8].

in particular, when discussing n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories in 4 dimensions,
there are three known methods currently in favour. the rst method is geometrical engineer-
ing exemplied by works in [9]; the second uses d3 branes as probes on orbifold singularities

of the type c2/ with  being a nite discrete subgroup of su(2) [10], and the third, the
usage of brane setups. these three approaches are related to each other by proper t or s
dualities [11]. for example, the conguration of stretching type iia d4 branes between
n + 1 ns5 branes placed in a circular fashion, the so-called elliptic model2, is precisely

t-dual to d3 branes stacked upon ale3 singularities of type dan (see [8, 12, 13, 14, 15] for

detailed discussions).

the above constructions can be easily generalised to n = 1 supersymmetric eld theories
in 4 dimensions. methods from geometric engineering as well as d3 branes as probes now
dictate the usage of orbifold singularities of the type c3/ with  being a nite discrete
subgroup of su(3) [16, 17]. a catalogue of all the discrete subgroups of su(3) in this con-
text is given in [18, 19]. now from the brane-setup point of view, there are two ways to
arrive at the theory. the rst is to rotate certain branes in the conguration to break the
supersymmetry from n = 2 to n = 1 [7]. the alternative is to add another type of ns5
branes, viz., a set of ns5 branes placed perpendicularly to the original ns5, whereby con-
structing the so-called brane box model [20, 21]. each of these two dierent approaches
has its own merits. while the former (rotating branes) facilitates the deduction of seiberg
duality, for the latter (brane box models), it is easier to construct a class of new, nite,
chiral eld theories [22]. by nite we mean that in the eld theory the divergences may
be cancelable. from the perspective of branes on geometrical singularities, this niteness
corresponds to the cancelation of tadpoles in the orbifold background and from that of brane
setups, it corresponds to the no-bending requirement of the branes [11, 22, 23]. indeed, as
with the n = 2 case, we can still show the equivalence among these dierent perspectives
by suitable s or t duality transformations. this equivalence is explicitly shown in [21] for
the case of the abelian nite subgroups of su(3). more precisely, for the group zk  zk
or zk and a chosen decomposition of 3 into appropriate irreducible representations thereof
one can construct the corresponding brane box model that gives the same quiver diagram
as the one obtained directly from the geometrical methods of attack; this is what we mean
by equivalence [16].

indeed, we are not satised with the fact that this abovementioned equivalence so far
exists only for abelian singularities and would like to see how it may be extended to non-
abelian cases. the aim for constructing brane box models of non-abelian nite groups
is twofold: rstly we would generate a new category of nite supersymmetric eld theories

2we call it elliptic even though there is only an s 1 upon which we place the d4 branes; this is because
from the m theory perspective, there is another direction: an s 1 on which we compactify to obtain type
type iia. the presence of two s 1s makes the theory toroidal, or elliptic. later we shall see how to make
use of t 2 = s 1  s 1 in type iib. for clarity we shall refer to the former as the n = 2 elliptic model and
the latter, the n = 1 elliptic model.

manifolds.

and secondly we would demonstrate how the equivalence between the brane box model and
d3 branes as probes is true beyond the abelian case and hence give an interesting physical
perspective on non-abelian groups. more specically, the problem we wish to tackle is that
given any nite discrete subgroup  of su(2) or su(3), what is the brane setup (in the
t-dual picture) that corresponds to d3 branes as probes on orbifold singularities aorded by

? for the su(2) case, the answer for the ba series was given in [8] and that for the cd series,
in [4], yet de6,7,8 are still unsolved. for the su(3) case, the situation is even worse. while

[20, 21] have given solutions to the abelian groups zk and zk  zk, the non-abelian  and
 series have yet to be treated. though it is not clear how the generalisation can be done
for arbitrary non-abelian singularities, it is the purpose of this writing to take one further
step from [20, 21], and address the next simplest series of dimension three orbifold theories,
viz., those of c3/zk  dk and construct the corresponding brane box model and show its
equivalence to geometrical methods. in addition to equivalence we demonstrate how the two
pictures are bijectively related for the group of interest and that given one there exists a
unique description in the other. the key input is given by kutasov, sen and kapustin in
[4, 24, 25]. moreover [26] has briey pointed out how his results may be used, but without
showing the consistency and equivalence.

the paper is organised as follows. in section 2 we shall briey review some techniques
of brane setups and orbifold projections in the context of nite quiver theories. section 3
is then devoted to a crucial digression on the mathematical properties of the group of our
interest, or what we call g := zk  dk. in section 4 we construct the brane box model
for g, followed by concluding remarks in section 5.

nomenclature

unless otherwise stated, we shall, throughout our paper, adhere to the notation that n =
n , the nth root of unity, that g refers to the group zk  dk , that without ambiguity zk
e
denotes zzk, the cyclic group of k elements, that dk is the binary dihedral group of order

4k and gives the ane dynkin diagram of cdk+2, and that dk denotes the ordinary dihedral

group of order 2k. moreover  will be dened as (k, 2k), the greatest common divisor (gcd)
of k and 2k.

2 a brief review of dn quivers, brane boxes, and

brane probes on orbifolds

the aim of our paper is to construct the brane box model of the non-abelian nite group
zk  dk and to show its consistency as well as equivalence to geometric methods. to do

3

so, we need to know how to read out the gauge groups and matter content from quiver
diagrams which describe a particular eld theory from the geometry side. the knowledge
for such a task is supplied in 2.1. next, as mentioned in the introduction, to construct eld
theories which could be encoded in the dk quiver diagram, we need an important result from
[4, 24, 25]. a brief review betting our aim is given in 2.2. finally in 2.3 we present the
rudiments of the brane box model.

2.1 branes on orbifolds and quiver diagrams

it is well-known that a stack of coincident n d3 branes gives rise to an n = 4 u(n) super-
yang-mills theory on the four dimensional world volume. the u(1) factor of the u(n) gauge
group decouples when we discuss the low energy dynamics of the eld theory and can be
ignored, therefore giving us an eective su(n) theory. for n = 4 in 4 dimensions the
r-symmetry is su(4). under such an r-symmetry, the fermions in the vector multiplet
transform in the spinor representation of su(4)  spin(6) and the scalars, in the vector
representation of spin(6), the universal cover of so(6). in the brane picture we can identify
the r-symmetry as the so(6) isometry group which acts on the six transverse directions of
the d3-branes. furthermore, in the ads/cft picture, this su(4) simply manifests as the
so(6) isometry group of the 5-sphere in ads5  s5 [16].

we shall refer to this gauge theory of the d3 branes as the parent theory and consider the
consequences of putting the stack on geometric singularities. a wide class of nite yang-mills
theories of various gauge groups and supersymmetries is obtained when the parent theory
is placed on orbifold singularities of the type cm/ where m = 2, 3. what this means is
that we select a discrete nite group   su(4) and let its irreducible representations {ri}
act on the chan-paton indices i, j = 1, ..., n of the d3 branes by permutation. only those
matter elds of the parent theory that are invariant under the group action of  remain, the
rest are eliminated by this so-called orbifold projection. we present the properties of the
parent and the orbifolded theory in the following diagram:

let us briey explain what the above table summarises. in the parent theory, there are, as
mentioned above, gauge bosons aij=1,...,n as singlets of spin(6), adjoint weyl fermions 4
ij
in the fundamental 4 of su(4) and adjoint scalars 6
ij in the antisymmetric 6 of su(4).
the projection is the condition that

a = ()  a  ()1

for the gauge bosons and

( or ) = r()  ()  ( or )  ()1

for the fermions and bosons respectively ( and r are appropriate representations of ).

solving these relations by using schurs lemma gives the information on the orbifold
su(ni)

theory. the equation for a tell us that the original u(n) gauge group is broken toqi
where ni are positive integers such thatpi

ni dim ri = n. we point out here that henceforth

we shall use the regular representation where n = n|| for some integer n and ni = n dim ri.
indeed other choices are possible and they give rise to fractional branes, which not only
provide interesting dynamics but are also crucial in showing the equivalence between brane
setups and geometrical engineering [27, 28]. the equations for  and  dictate that they
become bi-fundamentals which transform under various pairs (ni, nj) within the product

respectively for r = 4, 6.

the supersymmetry of the orbifold theory is determined by analysing the commutant of
 as it embeds into the parent su(4) r-symmetry. for  belonging to su(2), su(3) or the
full su(4), we respectively obtain n = 2, 1, 0. the corresponding geometric singularities are
as presented in the table. furthermore, the action of  clearly diers for   su(2, 3, or 4)
and the 4 and 6 that give rise to the bi-fundamentals must be decomposed appropriately.
generically, the number of trivial (principal) 1-dimensional irreducible representations corre-
sponds to the co-dimension of the singularity. for the matter matrices aij, these irreducible
representations give a contribution of ij and therefore to guaranteed adjoints. for example,
in the case of n = 2, there are 2 trivial 1s in the 4 and for n = 1, 4 = 1trivial  3. in
our paper, we focus on the latter case since zk  dk is in su(3) and gives rise to n = 1.
furthermore we acknowledge the inherent existence of the trivial 1-dimensional irrep and
focus on the decomposition of the 3.

the matrices ar=4,6

in (2.1) and the numbers dim ri contain all the information about
the matter elds and gauge groups of the orbifold theory. they can be conveniently encoded

ij

into so-called quiver diagrams. each node of such a diagram treated as a nite graph
represents a factor in the product gauge group and is labeled by dim ri. the (possibly
oriented) adjacency matrix for the graph is prescribed precisely by aij. the cases of n =
2, 3 are done [10, 18, 19, 29] and works toward the (non-supersymmetric) n = 0 case are
underway [30]. in the n = 2 case, the quivers must coincide with ade dynkin diagrams
treated as unoriented graphs in order that the orbifold theory be nite [9]. the quiver
diagrams in general are suggested to be related to wzw modular invariants [18, 31].

this is a brief review of the construction via geometric methods and it is our intent now

to see how brane congurations reproduce examples thereof.

2.2 dk quivers from branes

let us rst digress briey to ak quivers from branes. in the case of su(2)   = cak  zk+1,
polygon with k + 1 vertices. the gauge group is qi

the quiver theory should be represented by an ane ak dynkin diagram, i.e., a regular
su(ni)  u(1) with ni being a k + 1-
partition of n since ri are all one-dimensional4. however, we point out that on a classical
level we expect u(ni)s from the brane perspective rather than su(ni).
it is only after
considering the one-loop quantum corrections in the eld theory (or bending in the brane
picture) that we realise that the u(1) factors are frozen. this is explained in [8]. on the other
hand, from the point of view of d-branes as probes on the orbifold singularity, associated to
the anomalous u(1)s are eld-dependent fayet-illiopoulos terms generating which freezes
the u(1) factors. thess two prespectives are t-dual to each other. further details can be
found in [32].

now, placing k + 1 ns5 branes on a circle with ni stacked d4 branes stretched between
the ith and i+1st ns5 reproduces precisely this gauge group with the correct bifundamentals
provided by open strings ending on the adjacent d4 branes (in the compact direction). this
circular model thus furnishes the brane conguration of an an-type orbifold theory and is
summarised in figure 1. indeed t-duality in the compact direction transforms the k + 1 ns5
branes into a nontrivial metric, viz., the k + 1-centered taub-nut, precisely that expected
from the orbifold picture. since both the ns5 and the d4 are osprings of the m5 brane,
in the m-theory context, the circular conguration becomes ir4   in ir10,1, where  is
a k + 1-point compactication of a the riemann surface  swept out by the worldvolume
of the vebrane [8]. the duality group, which is the group of automorphisms among the
marginal couplings that arise in the resulting eld theory, whence becomes the fundamental
group of mk+1, the moduli space of an elliptic curve with k + 1 marked points.

4the u (1) corresponds to the centre-of-mass motion and decouples from other parts of the theory so that

when we discuss the dynamical properties, it does not contribute.

the introduction of on0 planes facilitates the next type of n = 2, d = 4 quiver the-

ories, namely those encoded by ane ddk dynkin diagrams [4]. the gauge group is now
the dynkin indices of the ddk diagrams.
there are two ways to see the ddk quiver in the brane picture: one in type iia theory

and the other, in type iib. because later on in the construction of the brane box model we
will use d5 branes which are in type iib, we will focus on type iib only (for a complete
description and how the two descriptions are related by t-duality, see [4]).
in this case,
what we need is the on0-plane which is the s-dual of a peculiar pair: a d5 brane on top
of an o5-plane. the one important property of the on0-plane is that it has an orbifold
description ir6  ir4/i where i is a product of world sheet fermion operator (1)fl with
the parity inversion of the ir4 [25]. let us place 2 parallel vertical on0 planes and k  2 ns5
branes in between and parallel to both as in figure 2. between the on0 and its immediately
adjacent ns5, we stretch 2n d5 branes; n of positive charge on the top and n of negative
charge below. now due to the projection of the on0 plane, n d5 branes of positive charge
give one su(n) gauge group and n d5 branes of negative charge give another. furthermore,
these d5 branes end on ns5 branes and the boundary condition on the ns5 projects out
the bi-fundamental hypermultiplets of these two su(n) gauge groups (for the rules of such
projections see [4]). moreover, between the two adjacent interior ns5s we stretch 2n d5
branes, giving su(2n)s for the gauge group. from this brane setup we immediately see

that the gauge theory is encoded in the ane quiver diagram of ddk.

2.3 brane boxes

we have seen in the last section, that positioning appropriate branes according to dynkin
diagrams - which for   su(2) have their adjacency matrices determined by the representa-
tion of , due to the mckay correspondence [18] - branengineers some orbifold theories that
can be geometrically engineered. the exceptional groups however, have so far been elusive

theories of the ddk type.

[4]. for   su(3), perhaps related to the fact that there is not yet a general mckay cor-
respondence5 above dimension 2, the problem becomes more subtle; brane setups have been
achieved for orbifolds of the abelian type, a restriction that has been argued to be necessary
for consistency [20, 21]. it is thus the purpose of this writing to show how a group-theoretic
twisting can relax this condition and move beyond abelian theories; to this we shall turn
later.

we here briey review the so-called zk  zk elliptic brane box model. the orbifold
theory corresponds to c3/{ = zk  zk  su(3)} and hence by arguments before we are
in the realm of n = 1 super-yang-mills. the generators for  are given, in its fundamen-
tal 3-dimensional representation6, by diagonal matrices diag(e
, 1) corresponding to
the zk which act non-trivially on the rst two coordinates of c3 and diag(1, e
k )
corresponding to the zk which act non-trivially on the last two coordinates of c3.

since  is a direct product of abelian groups, the representation thereof is simply a
kronecker tensor product of the two cyclic groups. or, from the branes perspective, we
should in a sense take a cartesian product or sewing between two n = 2 elliptic ak1 and
ak1 models discussed above, resulting in a brane conguration on s1  s1 = t 2. this is
the essence of the (n = 1 elliptic) brane box model [20, 21]. indeed the placement of a
perpendicular set of branes breaks the supersymmetry of the n = 2 model by one more half,
thereby giving the desired n = 1. more specically, we place k ns5 branes in the 012345 and
k ns5 branes in the 012367 directions, whereby forming a grid of kk boxes as in figure 3.
we then stretch nij d5 branes in the 012346 directions within the i, j-th box and compactify

5for gorenstein singularities of dimension 3, only those of the abelian type such that 1 is not an eigenvalue
of g g   are isolated. this restriction perhaps limits nave brane box constructions to abelian orbifold
groups [21]. for a discussion on the mckay correspondence as a ubiquitous thread, see [31].

6we have chosen the directions in the transverse spacetime upon which each cyclic factor acts; the choice
is arbitrary. in the language of nite groups, we have chosen the transitivity of the collineation sets. the
group at hand, zk  zk , is in fact the rst example of an intransitive subgroup of su (3). for a discussion
of nite subgroups of unitary groups, see [30] and references therein.

the bi-fundamental elds are then given according to adjacent boxes horizontally, vertically
su(n))  u(1) = su(n)kk  u(1) (here again

and diagonally and the gauge groups is (ni,j

the u(1) decouples) as expected from geometric methods. essentially we construct one box
for each irreducible representation of  = zk  zk such that going in the 3 directions as
shown in figure 3 corresponds to tensor decomposition of the irreducible representation in
that grid and a special 3-dimension representation which we choose when we construct the
brane box model.

we therefore see the realisation of abelian orbifold theories in dimension 3 as brane box
congurations; twisted identications of the grid can in fact lead to more exotic groups such
as zk  zkk/l. more details can be found in [21].

3 the group g = zk  dk

it is our intent now to investigate the next simplest example of intransitive subgroups of
su(3), i.e., the next innite series of orbifold theories in dimension 3 (for denitions on the
classication of collineation groups, see for example [30]). this will give us a rst example
of a brane box model that corresponds to non-abelian singularities.

motivated by the zk  zk treated in section 2, we let the second factor be the binary
dihedral group of su(2), or the dk series (we must point out that in our notation, the dk

group gives the cdk+2 dynkin diagram). therefore  is the group g = zk  dk, generated

we now present some crucial properties of this group g which shall be used in the next
section. first we remark that the  in g is really an abuse of notation, since g is certainly
not a direct product of these two groups. this is the cause why nave constructions of the
brane box model fail and to this point we shall turn later. what we really mean is that
the actions on the rst two and last two coordinates in the transverse directions by these
subgroups are to be construed as separate. abstractly, we can write the presentation of g
as

 = ,

 = 1,

mn = nm

m, n  zz

(3.2)

these relations compel all elements in g to be writable in the form m mnp. however,
before discussing the whole group, we nd it very useful to discuss the subgroup generated
by  and , i.e the binary dihedral group dk as a degenerate (k = 1) case of g, because the
properties of the binary dihedral group turn out to be crucial for the structure of the brane
box model and the meaning of twisting which we shall clarify later.

3.1 the binary dihedral dk  g

all the elements of dk can be written as pn with n = 0, 1 and p = 0, 1, ..., 2k  1, giving
the order of the group as 4k. we now move onto frobenius characters. it is easy to work
out the structure of conjugate classes. we have two conjugate classes (1), (k) which have
only one element, (k 1) conjugate classes (p, p), p = 1, .., k 1 which have two elements
and two conjugate classes (p even), (p odd) which have k elements. the class equation is
thus as follows:

4k = 1 + 1 + (k  1)  2 + 2  k.

moreover there are 4 1-dimensional and k  1 2-dimensional irreducible representations such
that the characters for the 1-dimensionals depend on the parity of k. now we have enough
facts to clarify our notation: the group dk gives k + 3 nodes (irreducible representations)

which corresponds to the dynkin diagram of ddk+2.

we summarise the character table as follows:

m, m = 0, .., k  1, n = 0, 1 and p = 0, ..2k  1, which we abbreviate as (m, m, n, p). in the
matrix form of our fundamental representation, they become

(m, m, n = 0, p) =

(m, m, n = 1, p) =

of course this representation is not faithful and there is a non-trivial orbit; we can easily
check the repeats:

(m, m, n = 0, p) = (m + k
(m, m, n = 1, p) = (m + k

(k,2k), m  k
(k,2k), m  k

(k,2k), n = 0, p  2k

(k,2k) )

(3.3)

where (k, 2k) denotes the largest common divisor between them. dividing by the factor of
this repeat immediately gives the order of g to be 4kk2
(k,2k) .

we now move on to the study of the characters of the group. the details of the con-
jugation automorphism, class equation and irreducible representations we shall leave to the

let us explain the above tables in more detail. the third row of each table give the
representative elements of the various conjugate classes. the detailed description of the
group elements in each conjugacy class is given in the appendix. it is easy to see, by using
the above character tables, that given two elements (mi, mi, ni, pi) i = 1, 2, if they share the
same characters (as given in the last two rows), they belong to same conjugate class as to
be expected since the character is a class function.

3.3 the tensor product decomposition in g

a concept crucial to character theory and representations is the decomposition of tensor
products into tensor sums among the various irreducible representations, namely the equation

rk  ri =mj

ak
ijrj.

not only will such an equation enlighten us as to the structure of the group, it will also
provide quintessential information to the brane box construction to which we shall turn
later. indeed the r in (2.1) is decomposed into direct sums of irreducible representations rk,
which by the additive property of the characters, makes the fermionic and bosonic matter
matrices ar
ij. in particular, knowing the specic decomposition
of the 3, we can immediately construct the quiver diagram prescribed by a3
ij as discussed in
2.1.

ij ordinary sums of matrices ak

we summarise the decomposition laws as follows (using the multi-index notation for the

irreducible representations introduced in the previous section).

3.4 d kk



, an important normal subgroup

we now investigate a crucial normal subgroup h  g. the purpose is to write g as a
canonical product of h with the factor group formed by quotienting g thereby, i.e., as
g  g/h  h. the need for this rewriting of the group will become clear in 4 on the brane
box construction. the subgroup we desire is the one presented in the following:

lemma 3.1 the subgroup

h := {(m, m, n, p)|m = 0, .., k  1; n = 0, 1; p = 0, ..., 2k  1}

is normal in g and is isomorphic to d kk

.



to prove normality we use the multiplication and conjugation rules in g given in the ap-
be generated by  and  using the notation
pendix as (5.12) and (5.13). moreover, let d kk
of 3.1, then isomorphism can be shown by the following bijection:



(m, m, 1, p)  
(m, m, 0, p)  

2k
 m k
2k
 m+ k

 (pk),
 p.

another useful fact is the following:

lemma 3.2 the factor group g/h is isomorphic to zk.

this is seen by noting that l, l = 0, 1, ...k  1 can be used as representatives of the cosets.
we summarise these results into the following

{k =

in the proposition, by  we do mean the internal semi-direct product between zk and
, in the sense [33] that (i) g = hzk as cosets, (ii) h is normal in g and
h := dk := d kk
zk is another subgroup, and (iii) h  zk = 1. now we no longer abuse the symbol  and
unambiguously use  to show the true structure of g. we remark that this representation is
in some sense more natural (later we shall see that this naturality is not only mathematical
but also physical). the mathematical natuality is seen by the lift from the normal subgroup
h. we will see what is the exact meaning of the twist we have mentioned before. when
to the whole group g, the
we include the generator  and lift the normal subgroup d kk
structure of conjugacy classes will generically change as well. for example, from



( b)1 = ( b+ 2k

 ),

(3.6)

 = even and collapse into one single conjugacy class if 2k

we see that the two dierent conjugacy classes ( even b) and ( odd b) will remain distinct
if 2k
 = odd. we formally call the
latter case twisted. further clarications regarding the structure of the conjugacy classes
of g from the new points of view, especially physical, shall be most welcome.

after some algebraic manipulation, we can write down all the conjugacy classes of g in
this new description. for xed a and 2k
 a),
(a 
 a), (b p even) and (b p odd).
the crucial point here is that, for every value of a, the structure of conjugacy classes is
almost the same as that of d kk
. there is a 1-1 correspondence (or the lifting without the
twist) as we go from the conjugacy classes of h to g, making it possible to use the idea
of [26] to construct the corresponding brane box model. we will see this point more clearly
later. on the other hand, when 2k
 = odd, for xed a, the conjugacy classes are no longer
in 1-1 correspondence between h and g. firstly, the last two classes of h will combine into
only one of g. secondly, the classes which contain only one element (the rst two in h) will
remain so only for a = even; for a = odd, the they will combine into one single class of g
which has two elements.



16

so far the case of 2k

 = odd befuddles us and we do not know how the twist obstructs
the construction of the brane box model. this twist seems to suggest quiver theories on
non-ane dk diagrams because the bifurcation on one side collapses into a single node, a
phenomenon hinted before in [18, 26]. it is a very interesting problem which we leave to
further work.

4 the brane box for zk  dk

4.1 the puzzle

the astute readers may have by now questioned themselves why such a long digression on
the esoterica of g was done; indeed is it not enough to straightforwardly combine the dk
quiver technique with the elliptic model and stack k copies of kapustins conguration on a
circle to give the zk dk brane boxes? let us investigate where this navete fails. according
to the discussions in 2.3, one must construct one box for each irreducible representation of
g. let us place 2 on0 planes with k parallel ns5 branes in between as in 2.2, and then
copy this k times in the direction of the on0 and compactify that direction. this would give
us k + k boxes each containing 2 1-dimensional irreducible representations corresponding to
the boxes bounded by one on0 and one ns5 on the two ends. and in the middle we would
have k(k  1) boxes each containing 1 2-dimensional irreducible representation.

 = even and for 2k

 = odd, 2k 1-dimensionals and k( kk

therefrom arises a paradox already! from the discussion of the group g = zk  dk in
3, we recall that there are 4k 1-dimensional irreducible representations and k( kk
(k,2k)  1)
2-dimensionals if 2k
2) 2-
dimensionals. our attempt above gives a mismatch of the number the 2-dimensionals by
a factor of as large as k; there are far too many 2-dimensionals for g to be placed into
the required kk boxes. this mismatch tells us that such nave constructions of the brane
box model fails. the reason is that in this case what we are dealing with is a non-abelian
group and the noncommutative property thereof twists the nave structure of the singularity.
to correctly account for the property of the singularity after the non-abelian twisting, we
should attack in a new direction. in fact, the discussion of the normal subgroup h in 3.4 is
precisely the way to see the structure of singularity more properly. indeed we have hinted,
at least for 2k
 = even, that the nave structure of the brane box model can be applied again
with a little modication, i.e., with the replacement of dk by d kk
. here again we have the
generator of zk acting on the rst two coordinates of c3 and the generators of d kk
acting
on the last two. this is the subject of the next sub section where we will give a consistent
brane box model for g = zk  dk.

4.2 the construction of brane box model

let us rst discuss the decomposition of the fermionic 4 for which we shall construct the
brane box (indeed the model will dictate the fermion bi-fundamentals, bosonic matter elds
will be given therefrom by supersymmetry). as discussed in [18] and 2.1, since we are in an
n = 1 (i.e., a co-dimension one theory in the orbifold picture), the 4 must decompose into
13 with the 1 being trivial. more precisely, since g has only 1-dimensional or 2-dimensional
irreducible representations, for giving the correct quiver diagram which corresponds to the
brane box model the 4 should go into one trivial 1-dimensional, one non-trivial 1-dimensional
and one 2-dimensional according to

4  (0, 1)1  (l, h)1  (d, l)2.

of course we need a constraint so as to ensure that such a decomposition is consistent with
the unity-determinant condition of the matrix representation of the groups. since from
(3.5) we can compute the determinant of the (d, l)2 to be (1)(n+1)(d+1)(m+ m)(2ld)
, the
constraining condition is l + 2l  d  0(modk). in particular we choose

k

3  (l = 1, h = 1)1 + (d = 1, l = 0)2;

(4.7)

indeed this choice is precisely in accordance with the dening matrices of g in 3 and we
will give the brane box model corresponding to this decomposition and check consistency.
now we construct the brane box using the basic idea in [26] . let us focus on the case
of  := (k, 2k) being even where we have 4k 1-dimensional irreducible representations and
k( kk
(k,2k)  1) 2-dimensionals. we place 2 on0 planes vertically at two sides. between them
we place kk
). next we place
k ns5 branes horizontally (which give the structure of zk) and identify the kth with the
zeroth. this gives us a grid of k( kk
 + 1) boxes. next we put n d5 branes with positive
charge and n with negative charge in those grids. under the decomposition (4.7), we can
connect the structure of singularity to the structure of brane box model by placing the
irreducible representations into the grid of boxes `a la [20, 21] as follows (the setup is shown
in figure 4).

 vertically parallel ns5 branes (which give the structure of d kk



first we place the 4k 1-dimensionals at the two sides such that those boxes each contains
two: at the left we have (l = 0, h = 1)1 and (l = 0, h = 3)1 at the lowest box and with
the upper boxes containing subsequent increments on l. therefore we have the list, in going
up the boxes, {(0, 1)1 & (0, 3)1; (1, 1)1 & (1, 3)1; (2, 1)1 & (2, 3)1; ...(k  1, 1)1 & (k  1, 3)1}.
the right side has a similar list: {(0, 2)1 & (0, 4)1; (1, 2)1 & (1, 4)1; (2, 2)1 & (2, 4)1; ...(k 
1, 2)1 & (k  1, 4)1}. into the middle grids we place the 2-dimensionals, one to a box, such
that the bottom row consists of {(d = 1, l = 0)2, (2, 0)2, (3, 0)2, ...( kk
  1, 0)2} from left to
right. and as we go up we increment l until l = k  1 (l = k is identied with l = 0

ns5 branes

figure 4: the brane box model for zk  dk . we place d := kk
 ns5 branes in between 2

circularly. within the boxes of this grid, we stretch d5 branes, furnishing bi-fundamental as
indicated by the arrows shown.

due to our compactication). now we must check the consistency condition. we choose
the bi-fundamental directions according to the conventions in [20, 21], i.e., east, north and
southwest. the consistency condition is that for the irreducible representation in box i,
forming the tensor product with the 3 chosen in (4.7) should be the tensor sum of the
irreducible representations of the neighbours in the 3 chosen directions, i.e.,

3  ri = mjneighbours

rj

(4.8)

of course this consistency condition is precisely (2.1) in a dierent guise and checking it
amounts to seeing whether the brane box model gives the same quiver theory as does the
geometry, whereby showing the equivalence between the two methods. now the elaborate
tabulation in 3.3 is seen to be not in vain; let us check (4.8) by column in the brane box as
in figure 4. for the ith entry in the leftmost column, containing ri = (l, 1 or 3), we have
ri  3 = (l, 1 or 3)1  ((1, 1)1  (1, 0)2) = (l + 1, 1 or 3)1  (1, l)2. the righthand side
is precisely given by the neighbour of i to the east and to the north and since there is no
southwest neighbour, consistency (4.8) holds for the leftmost column. a similar situation
holds for the rightmost column, where we have 3(l, 2 or 4) = (l+1, 2 or 4)1( kk
 1, l1)2,
the neighbour to the north and the southwest.

19

now we check the second column, i.e., one between the rst and second ns5-branes. for
the ith entry ri = (1, l)2, after tensoring with the 3, we obtain (1, l + 1)2  (l + 1, l + 0)2 
((l + 0  1, 1)1  (l + 0  1, 3)1), which are the irreducible representations precisely in the 3
neighbours: respectively east, north and the two 1-dimensional in the southwest. whence
(4.8) is checked. of course a similar situation occurs for the second column from the right
where we have 3(ri = ( kk
 11, l 1)2 ((l, 2)1 (l, 4)1),
or respectively the neighbours to the north, southwest and the east.

 1, l + 2)2 ( kk

 1, l)2) = ( kk

the nal check is required of the interior box, say ri = (d, l)2. its tensor with 3 gives
(d, l + 1)2  (d  1, l  1)2  (d + 1, l)2, precisely the neighbours to the north, southwest and
east.

4.3 the inverse problem

a natural question arises from our quest for the correspondence between brane box con-
structions and branes as probes: is such a correspondence bijective? indeed if the two are
to be related by some t duality or generalisations thereof, this bijection would be neces-
sary. our discussions above have addressed one direction: given a zk  dk singularity, we
have constructed a consistent brane box model. now we must ask whether given such a
conguration with m ns5 branes between two on0 planes and k ns5 branes according to
figure 4, could we nd a unique zk  dk orbifold which corresponds thereto? the answer
fortunately is in the armative and is summarised in the following:

2k
(k,2k) being even7, there exists a bijection8 between the brane
proposition 4.2 for
box model and the d3 brane-probes on the orbifold for the group g := zkdk = zkdm:= kk
in particular

(k,2k)

.

 (i) given k and k, whereby determining g and hence the orbifold theory, one can

construct a unique brane box model;

 (ii) given k and m with the condition that k is a divisor of m, where k is the number
of ns5 branes perpendicular to on 0 planes and m the number of ns5 branes between
two on 0 planes as in figure 4, one can extract a unique orbifold theory.

now we have already shown (i) by our extensive discussion in the previous sections.

indeed, given integers k and k, we have twisted g such that it is characterised by k and

m :=

kk

(k, 2k)

,

two numbers that uniquely x the brane conguration. the crux of the remaining direction
(ii) seems to be the issue whether we could, given k and m, ascertain the values of k and
k uniquely? for if so then our brane box model, which is solely determined by k and m,
would be uniquely mapped to a zk  dk orbifold, characterised by k and k. we will show
below that though this is not so and k and k cannot be uniquely solved, it is still true that g
remains unique. furthermore, we will outline the procedure by which we can nd convenient
choices of k and k that describe g.

let us analyse this problem in more detail. first we see that k, which determines the zk
in g, remains unchanged. therefore our problem is further reduced to: given m, is there a
unique solution of k at xed k? we write k, k, m as:

k = 2qlf2
k = 2plf1
m = 2nf3

(4.10)

where with the extraction of all even factors, l, f1 and f2 are all odd integers and l is
the greatest common divisor of k and k so that f1, f2 are coprime. what we need to know
2k
(k,2k) = even, a condition on
are l, f1 and p given k, q, n and f3. the rst constraint is that
which our paper focuses. this immediately yields the inequality p  q. the denition of m
(4.9) above further gives

2nf3 = m = 2plf1f2 = 2pqkf1.

from this equation, we can solve

p = n,

f1 =

m

2pqk

(4.11)

now it remains to determine l. however, the solution for l is not unique. for example, if we
take l = l1l2 and (l2, f1) = 1, then the following set {k, k} will give same k, m:

k = k = 2ql1l2f2

k = 2pl1f1
m = 2nf3

this non-uniqueness in determining k, k from k, m may at rst seem discouraging. however
we shall see below that dierent pairs of {k, k} that give the same {k, m} must give the
same group g.

we rst recall that g can be written as zkdm= kk
zk and dm are same. for the whole group zkdm= kk
choose we just need to show that the algebraic relation which generate zkdm= kk

. for xed k, m the two subgroups
be unique no matter which k we
from

(k,2k)

(k,2k)

(k,2k)

21

zk and dm is same. for that, we recall from the proposition in section 3.4, that in twisting
g into its internal semi-direct form, the crucial relation is

 = 

2k

(k,2k) 

k

(k,2k) = m

k where the condition that k is a divisor of m makes the
indeed we observe that
expression having meaning. whence given m and k, the presentation of g as zkdm is
uniquely xed, and hence g is uniquely determined. this concludes our demonstration for
the above proposition.

now the question arises as to what values of k and k result in the same g and how
the smallest pair (or rather, the smallest k since k is xed) may be selected. in fact our
discussion above prescribes a technique of nding such a pair. first we solve p, f1 using
(4.11), then we nd the largest factor h of k which satises (h, f1) = 1. the smallest value
of k is then such that l = k
h in (4.10). finally, we wish to emphasize that the bijection we
have discussed is not true for arbitrary {m, k} and we require that k be a divisor of m as is
needed in demonstration of the proposition. indeed, given m and k which do not satisfy this
condition, the 1-1 correspondence between the brane box model and the orbifold singularity
is still an enigma and will be left for future labours.

5 conclusions and prospects

we have briey reviewed some techniques in two contemporary directions in the construction
of gauge theories from branes, namely branes as geometrical probes on orbifold singularities
or as constituents of congurations of d branes stretched between ns branes. some rudi-

ments in the orbifold procedure, in the brane setup of n = 2 quiver theories of the ddk type

as well as in the n = 1 zk  zk brane box model have been introduced. thus inspired, we
have constructed the brane box model for an innite series of non-abelian nite subgroups
of su(3), by combining some methodology of the aforementioned brane setups.

in particular, we have extensively studied the properties, especially the representation
and character theory of the intransitive collineation group g := zk  dk  su(3), the
next simplest group after zk  zk and a natural extension thereof. from the geometrical
perspective, this amounts to the study of gorenstein singularities of the type c3/g with the
zk acting on the rst two complex coordinates of c3 and dk, the last two.

we have shown why nave brane box constructions for g fail (and indeed why non-
abelian groups in general may present diculties). it is only after a twist of g into a
semi-direct product form zkd kk
, an issue which only arises because of the non-abelian

(k,2k)

2k
(k,2k) even, we have successfully
nature of g, that the problem may be attacked. for
established a consistent brane box model. the resulting gauge theory is that of k copies

22

of cd-type quivers circularly arranged (see figure 4). however for

2k
(k,2k) odd, a degeneracy
occurs and we seem to arrive at ordinary (non-ane) d quivers, a phenomenon hinted at by
some previous works [26, 18] but still remains elusive. furthermore, we have discussed the
inverse problem, i.e., whether given a conguration of the brane box model we could nd
the corresponding branes as probes on orbifolds. we have shown that when k is a divisor of
m the two perspectives are bijectively related and thus the inverse problem can be solved.
for general {m, k}, the answer of the inverse problem is still not clear.

many interesting problems arise and are open. apart from clarifying the physical meaning
2k
(k,2k) odd case, we can try to construct brane
of twisting and hence perhaps treat the
boxes for more generic non-abelian groups. moreover, marginal couplings and duality groups
thereupon may be extracted and interpreted as brane motions; this is of particular interest
because toric methods from geometry so far have been restricted to abelian singularities.
also, recently proposed brane diamond models [34] may be combined with our techniques to
shed new insight. furthermore during the preparation of this manuscript, a recent paper that
deals with brane congurations for c3/ singularities for non-abelian  (i.e the  series in
su(3)) by (p, q)5-brane webs has come to our attention [35]. we hope that our construction,
as the brane box model realisation of a non-abelian orbifold theory in dimension 3, may
lead to insight in these various directions.

appendix

using the notation introduced in 3, we see that the conjugation within g gives

(q, q, n, k)1(m, m, n, p)(q, q, n, k) =



( m + q  q, m  q + q, n, 2k  p) for n = 0, n = 0
(m  q + q, m + q  q, n, 2k + p) for n = 0, n = 1
( m, m, n, p) for n = 1, n = 0
(m, m, n, p) for n = 1, n = 1.

(5.12)

also, we present the multiplication rules in g for reference:

(m, m, 0, p1)(n, n, 0, p2) = (m + n, m + n, 1, p2  p1)

23

(m, m, 0, p1)(n, n, 1, p2) = (m + n, m + n, 0, p2 + p1  k)

(m, m, 1, p1)(n, n, 0, p2) = (m + n, m + n, 0, p2  p1  k)

(m, m, 1, p1)(n, n, 1, p2) = (m + n, m + n, 1, p2 + p1  k)

(5.13)

first we focus on the conjugacy class of elements such that n = 0. from (3.3) and (5.12),
we see that if two elements are within the same conjugacy class, then they must have the
same m + m mod k. now we need to distinguish between two cases:

 (i) if

2k
(k,2k) = even, the orbit conditions conserve the parity of p, making even and odd

p belong to dierent conjugacy classes;

 (ii) if

2k
(k,2k) = odd, the orbit conditions change p and we nd that all p belong to the

same conjugacy class they have the same value for m + m.

in summary then, for
elements; for

2k
(k,2k) = even, we have 2k conjugacy classes each of which has

kk

(k,2k)

2k
(k,2k) = odd, we have k conjugacy classes each of which has

2kk
(k,2k) elements.

next we analyse the conjugacy class corresponding to n = 1. for simplicity, we divide

the interval [0, k) by factor (k, 2k) and dene

vi ="

ik

(k, 2k)

(i + 1)k

(k, 2k)!

,

with i = 0, ..., (k, 2k)  1. now from (3.3), we can always x m to belong v0. thereafter,
m and p can change freely within [0, k)/[0, 2k). again, we have two dierent cases. (i) if
(k,2k) = even, for every subinterval vi we have 2k0 (we dene k0 := 2 k
(k,2k) ) conjugacy classes
each containing only one element, namely,

2k

(m, m = m +

or 2k

(k, 2k)

).

2 + k0(k01)

2k = k0(k  1) + kk2

also we have a total of k0
classes of 2 elements, namely (m, m, n = 1, p) and ( m  ik
indeed, the total number of conjugacy classes is 2k + (k, 2k)(2k0) + (k, 2k)(kk2

(k,2k) 1), giving the order of g as expected. furthermore, there are 4k 1-dimensional
(k,2k)  1) 2-dimensional irreducible representations. this

(k,2k), n = 1, p  i 2k

(k,2k) , m + ik

0 + k0k = kk2

is consistent since pi dim ri = 12  4k + 22  k( kk

we summarize case (i) into the following table:
