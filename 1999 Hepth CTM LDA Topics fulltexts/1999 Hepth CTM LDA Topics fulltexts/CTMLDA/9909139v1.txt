abstract

we investigate transformation from ordinary gauge eld to
noncommutative one which was introduced by n. seiberg and
e. witten (hep-th/9908142). it is shown that the general trans-
formation which is only determined by gauge equivalence has a
path dependence in -space, but this ambiguity is negligible in
comparison of dirac-born-infeld action in u(1) case, because of
the u(1) nature and of its very rough approximation. however,
next order approximation or u(n) case, ambiguity is not negli-
gible due to its noncommutative structure.

1 introduction

gauge theories on noncommutative spaces have been investigated for many
years from mathematical and physical viewpoint [2].
in string theory, es-
pecially the worldvolume theory of d-branes in a background b-eld is de-
scribed by noncommutative yang-mills or dirac-born-infeld theory.

recently, seiberg and witten [1] argued the equivalence between ordinary
gauge elds and noncommutative gauge elds as the low energy eective
theory of open strings: they arise from same two-dimensional eld theory
regularlized in dierent ways, so that there must be a transformation among
them. in [1], this transformation is uniquely given by the gauge equivalence
relation, and this implies the equivalence between ordinary dirac-born-infeld
action and noncommutative one.

in this short note, we re-examine the validity of above arguments and
point out that the transformation of [1] has in general ambiguities. in section
2, we begin with the gauge equivalence relation between two nearby points
in the -space and show that there are ambiguities with arbitrary constant
parameters, which is understood in some trivial sense. and then, we discuss
its path dependence in the -space, which arises with innitesimal deriva-
tion twice. this implies the existence of another source for ambiguity. in
section 3 we investigate these ambiguities from another viewpoint. next in
section 4, we consider u(1) case in slowly varying eld approximation. this
is the situation of [1], comparing ordinary dirac-born-infeld action with non-
commutative one. in this case all ambiguities do not change the result of [1],
because of the u(1) nature and of the very rough approximation. in section
5, we give some conclusion and discussion.

2 gauge equivalence relation

in [1], it is obtained that a transformation from ordinary gauge eld ai (and
gauge parameter ) to noncommutative gauge eld ai (and gauge parameter
) by demanding their gauge equivalence relation. however, it will be shown
that their statement has generally ambiguity. here we investigate the gauge
equivalence relation carefully.

consider a noncommutative, associative algebra a = (g  c , ) ,where
g is some lie algebra and the  product is dened to be the tensor prod-
uct of matrix multiplication with the product of functions such as f (x) 

1

g(x) := exp(cid:16)i kl

yk



zl(cid:17) f (y)g(z)|y=z=x with constant antisymmetric tensor

kl = lk. note that  are arbitrary parameters and we denote -space 
as parameter spaces of whole set of algebra {a}.

we assume there exists some mapping from a to another a in a way
that preserve gauge equivalence relation, which is described by the following
equation in terms of gauge elds and gauge parameters ai( a), ( a, )  a
and ai,   a:

ai( a) + 

(1)
ai = di =
where  is the gauge transformation with innitesimal , i.e., 
i  ih ai, i . 1 and likewise for . this relation means naively that the

ai( a) = ai( a + 

a),

diagram below is commutative.

a

ai



especially in the case of nearby points in , i.e.,  =  +  with in-
nitesimal , this commutativity is signicant because (1) is written in the
variational form in this case as

 ai = 

ai

(2)

by writing a = a +  a( a) + o(),  =  + ( a, ) + o() and expanding
to rst order in .

we rst look for the solution of eq.(1) in the way that is discussed in next

section. it can be easily rewritten as 2

 ai  di + ih ai, i =  1

2 kl{k ai, l},

which corresponds to n = 1 case of (10). note that this form is actually the
same one in [1]: the  version of eq.(3.4). it is solved most generally by (see
next section for detail)

(5)

where fij = i aj j aiih ai, aji is the eld strength and ,  are arbitrary

constants.
( =  = 0 case corresponds to (3.8) of [1].) this says that
only with the requirement of the gauge equivalence there exist in general
ambiguity to determine a innitesimal mapping. however, note that its
ambiguity has rather trivial origin because we looked for two functions  ai,
 as the solution of one equation (2), and that the terms with ,  have
formally a form of some gauge transformation. from the beginning, the
mapping that preserves the gauge equivalence relation is the one which maps
gauge orbits from a to a rather than gauge elds themselves. therefore,
this kind of ambiguity is not relevant when we discuss only gauge equivalence
classes.

however, applying -variation twice, we will encounter the second kind
of ambiguities. denote each variation as 1 and 2, respectively, which are in
general dierent direction with each other in the -space, and consider their
commutation relation acting on ai:

[1, 2] ai,

which measures the path dependence in -space . substituting the rst
line of (5) twice, we obtain explicitly

note that the sum of all ,  dependent terms again has the form of some
gauge transformation (with ai dependent parameter), which is naturally un-
derstood because gauge transformations are closed under commutation re-
lations. contrary, ,  independent terms are quite nontrivial and they do
not disappear in general. that is there exists path dependence if we repeat
variations more than one step in . in terms of the gauge equivalence, (7)
means as follows.
in the same sence as discussion above for the one-step
derivation, a gauge orbit in a is mapped to a orbit in a+1+2, but now
depending on the path, orbits mapped along two paths are not same.

a vertical line denotes gauge orbit on a point in -space.

the double line denotes two dierent orbits on the same point.

this second type of ambiguities accumulate globally in -space, if we
consider any mapping from a to a at a nite distance in -space. in other
words, if a path is xed by hand, its transformation on gauge elds can be
described by the integration for  as

a = zpath

 a.

(8)

of course,  a has also the rst type of ambiguities. if we further x  and
 by hand, i.e. select a representative, then a is uniquely determined. the
procedure described in [1], where the functional a(a) is determined order by
order in , is exactly the one discussed here. in fact, in this case with  = 0
and  = , if we x  =  = 0 and choose a straight line in -space as the
path of integration. here the straight line corresponds to the existence of
formal exponential solution of (5) whose exponent is almost  operation.

note that there exist no rule to select a particular path from the stand-
point of gauge theory (or more precisely a space of whole set of algebra
{a}.) it needs some physical requirement. in 4 we discuss the equiva-
lence of actions between ordinary gauge theory and noncommutative one in
this point of view.

3 more comments on ambiguity

in this section, we investigate gauge equivalence relation (1) from another
viewpoint.

to get a transformation which satises (1) from ai,   a to ai,   a

directly, we expand formally ai as the power series of  =   :

ai =



xn=0

a(n)

i

,  =



xn=0

(n),

(9)

where a(n)

i

, (n)  a are o(n), and a(0)

i = ai, (0) = .

substitute this formal expansion (9) in (1), the equation of o(n) is



a(n)

where summation ranges in p + q + r = n, p, q, r  0, p 6= n, q 6= n and [ , }
denotes { , } if r is odd, [ , ] if r is even, respectively. this equation means
that a(n)
, (n) in the left hand side are determined by o(n1) quantities in
the right hand side.

that is, concrete procedure to get a(n)

, (n) is as follows : using the
, (k) up to o(n1), we write a(n), (n) as a polynomial
solution of (10) a(k)
of n, ai, j ak, . . . , , l, . . . in most general form with expected indices 3
and substitute it in (10), then we can determine its coecients order by order
of .

however, suppose there are some functions a0(n)

, 0(n) such that

(11)

then we can freely add them to a(n)
using relation

i.e., replaces ai with i but does not act on ai

in di. here we take g as a polynomial of ai, di aj, . . . in a. in the same
way,

dk fij = ih dk fij, i , . . . ,

follows

3we assume here that a transformation from ai,  to ai,  can be expressed by some

polynomial of ai, , j ak, . . . , mn only and indices are contracted among them.

i

( fjk, dl fmn, . . . ; n) + di g(n)( aj, dk al, . . . ; n)

(16)

this means that there is large ambiguity due to arbitrary polynomials
g(n)( aj, dk al, . . . ; n), g(n)f
result is consistent with path dependence of 2.

( fjk, dl fmn, . . . ; n) order by order in (9). this

in particular, if we take  innitesimal and consider up to o(1) then

the ambiguity has the form as

g(1)( aj, dk al, . . . ; 1) = kl[ ak, al],

g(1)f

i

( fjk, dl fmn, . . . ; 1) = kl di fkl,

(17)

where ,  are arbitrary constants. from (17)(16) this is the ,  dependent
term in (5). note that these ,  parameters are most general ambiguity in
o(1).

4 u (1) case

in this section, we consider the case that the gauge group is u(1). and we
assume here that fij is slowly varying and can ignore o( f ). this approxi-
mation is adopted when we consider dirac-born-infeld action. precisely, we
regard f   a as o(1) and count the order by (the number of )(that of
a).

note that di = i+jkj aik +o( f ), fij = i aj j ai+klk ail aj +
o(4 f ), and that ,  dependent terms are o(2 f ) and negligible in  ai in
(5).

(7) follows in this approximation as

in [1] it is discussed ordinary dirac-born-infeld lagrangian and noncom-

respect to . the gauge eld of ordinary dirac-born-infeld theory is in a=0
and noncommutative one is in a6=0.
in their proof, (5) is used with
 =  = 0. as shown above, there is in general ambiguity due to , 
dependence in (5) but this is negligible.

as previous sections there is ambiguity to determine ai (or fij) from ai

because of path dependence in -space, that implies

ldbi|  ldbi| = zpath

metric and ns 2-form eld, respectively.  = 0 case is (ordinary) noncommutative dirac-
born-infeld action.

but this path dependence is up to gauge transformation (16)(17) and neg-
ligible. therefore their proof of equivalence of ordinary dirac-born-infeld
action and noncommutative one (or generally equivalence of the action (20)
in -space) is also justied from our context. this means that in this physical
input (i.e., equivalence of ordinary dbi action and noncommutative one) no
ambiguity is restricted.

5 conclusions and discussions

we considered a transformation from ai,   a to ai,   a which is
determined by gauge equivalence. this transformation has large ambiguity
due to path dependence in -space. however this ambiguity is negligible in
particular in u(1) case and in rough approximation ignoring o( f ). this
fact justies equivalence of noncommutative dirac-born-infeld lagrangian
(20) in -space.

however the ambiguity is no longer negligible in u(n) case or u(1) case
if  6= 0 and o( f ) is considered because path dependence (7) is not the
form of gauge transformation. so if one considers o( f ) correction from
dirac-born-infeld action or u(n) generalization of (20) by using transfor-
mation restricted only by gauge equivalence, one should treat it carefully.
geometrical interpretation of variation with respect to  such as (5) would
be required.
