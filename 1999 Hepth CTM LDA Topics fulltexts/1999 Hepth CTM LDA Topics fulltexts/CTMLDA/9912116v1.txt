abstract

the condensation of a dualvector eld is investigated in the dual monopole nambu
jonalasinio model with dual dirac strings. the condensate of a dualvector eld is calcu-
lated as a functional of a shape of a dual dirac string. the obtained result is compared with
the gluon condensate calculated in a qcd sum rules approach and on lattice.

introduction

eective lagrangian of the dual magnetic monopole nambujonalasinio model.
in our recent publications [14] we have shown that the dual monopole nambujonalasinio
model (mnjl) with dual dirac strings is a perfect continuum spacetime analogy of com-
pact quantum electrodynamics (cqed) [5]. as has been shown in ref.[5] cqed possesses
the same nonperturbative phenomena as lowenergy qcd. the mnjl model is based on a
lagrangian, invariant under magnetic u (1) symmetry, with massless magnetic monopoles self
coupled through a local fourmonopole interaction [1,2]:

l(x) = (x)i(x) + g[ (x)(x)]2  g1[ (x)(x)][ (x)(x)],

(1.1)

where (x) is a massless magnetic monopole eld, g and g1 are positive phenomenological
constants. below we will show that we have to choose g1 = g/4 for the self consistency of the
theory in the one loop approximation [3,4].

the magnetic monopole condensation accompanies the creation of  collective excitations

with the quantum numbers of a scalar higgs meson eld  and a dualvector eld c.

for the derivation of an eective lagrangian the  and c elds are introduced as cyclic

variables.

where v(x) is dened

l(x) = (x)i(x)  v(x),

(1.2)

 v(x) = (x)(g c(x)   (x)) (x) 

2
4g

2(x) +

g2
4g1

c(x)c (x).

(1.3)

now we can show that the vacuum expectation value (v.e.v) of the  eld does not vanish. for
this aim we have to derive the equation of motion of the  eld by varying the lagrangian
eq.(1.1) with respect to the  eld:

l(x)
(x)

=   (x)(x) 

2
4g

(x) = 0.

this leads to

taking the v.e.v. of both sides of eq.(1.5) we get

(x) = 

2g


(x)(x).

h(x)i = 

2g


h (x)(x)i = 

2g


< (0)(0)i,

(1.4)

(1.5)

(1.6)

where h (0)(0)i is the magnetic monopole condensate. thus, the nonzero value of the v.e.v.
of the  eld is related to the monopole condensation. in order to deal with a physical scalar
eld, the eld, we should follow the standard procedure and subtract <(x)>. this gives
(x) = (x)  < (x) >. the v.e.v. of the eld can be expressed in terms of the mass of
the magnetic monopole m in the superconducting phase [14], < (x) >= m/, where m is
proportional to <(0)(0)> [14]

m =  2 g h (0)(0)i.

(1.7)

this is the gapequation testifying the appearance of massive magnetic monopoles in the super-
conducting phase, where < (0)(0)>6= 0. as has been shown in refs.[1,2] it also leads to the

2

suppression of direct transitions between the physical scalar eld  and the nonperturbative
vacuum.

in terms of the eld the lagrangian eq.(1.2) reads

l(x) = (x)(i  m ) (x)  v(x),

(1.8)

where now v(x) reads

 v(x) = (x)( g c(x)   (x))(x) 

2

2(x) +

(1.9)

integrating out the magnetic monopole elds we arrive at the eective lagrangian

with l(x)e dened as

the eective lagrangian le (x) can be represented by an innite series

le(x) =  i* x(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(1.13)

at k1 + k2 + . . . + kn = 0 . the r.h.s. of eq.(1.13) describes the onemassivemonopole loop
diagram with nvertices. the monopoleloop diagrams with two vertices (n = 2) determine
the kinetic term of the eld and give the contribution to the kinetic term of the celd,
while the diagrams with (n  3) describe the vertices of interactions of the  and c elds. in
accordance with the prescription given in [1,2] the eective lagrangian le (x) should be dened
by the set of divergent one-massivemonopoleloop diagrams with n = 1, 2, 3 and 4 vertices.
the evaluation of these diagrams gives

in order to get correct factors of the  and c eld kinetic terms we have to set [1,2]

g2
12 2 j2(m ) = 1 ,

2
8 2 j2(m ) = 1 .

(1.15)

(1.16)

so, the coupling constants are connected by the relation 2 = 2g2/3 [1,2].

the eective lagrangian eq.(1.14) contains a term linear in the eld. this part of the
eective lagrangian leads to direct transitions   vacuum. in the case of a physical eld
such transitions should be suppressed. in order to suppress these transitions we have to impose
the constraint [14]

22 j1(m ) = 0,

where j1(m ) can be connected with the monopole condensate [14]

< (0)(0) >=

42 m j1(m ).

inserting eq.(1.18) into eq.(1.17) we arrive at the gapequation (1.7)

the coecient in front of the last term in eq.(1.14) denes the mass of the c eld:

m 2

(1.17)

(1.18)

(1.19)

piling up the gapequation (1.7) and the constraint (1.16) we recast the eective lagrangian
(1.14) into the form

(1.21)

as has been shown in ref.[3,4] the gapequation, in turn, can be derived in the onemonopole
loop approximation by using only the lagrangian eq.(1.1). when comparing these two gap
equations we get the relation g1 = g/4 that reduces the number of input parameters [3,4].
wave function of the nonperturbative vacuum. the mnjl model as well as the njl
model [6] and the bcs theory of superconductivity [7] possesses a nontrivial nonperturbative
vacuum with a wave function [2]

|0i(m ) = y~p,=1"r 1 + ~p

+ r 1  ~p

a(0)(~p, ) b(0)(~p, )# |0i,

(1.22)

where ~p = ~p/e~p = ~p/p~p 2 + m 2 is the velocity of a massive monopole with the mass m ,

and a(0)(~p, ) (or b(0)(~p, )) denotes the creation operator of a massless monopole ( or anti
monopole) with a momentum ~p and helicity ; |0i = |0i(0) is the wave function of the perturbative
vacuum of the noncondensed phase. the wave function |0i(m ) of the nonperturbative vacuum
is distinctly invariant under magnetic u (1) symmetry. the former implies that in the condensed
phase the magnetic u (1) symmetry is not broken [2]. this is the main peculiarity of the mnjl
model with respect to the dual higgs model with dual dirac strings [810], where the magnetic
u (1) symmetry is broken spontaneously in the superconducting phase.

the wave function of the nonperturbative vacuum |0i(m ) is invariant under party transfor-

mations p, p|0i(m ) = |0i(m ).

in order to show that the magnetic monopole condensate h (0)(0)i has a distinct meaning
of the order parameter we, following the bcs theory of superconductivity [7], can introduce two
operators possessing dierent properties under parity transformations

o+ = 2x~p x=1
o = 2x~p x=1

 b(0)(~p, ) a(0)(~p, ) , po+p  = + o+,

b(0)(~p, ) a(0)(~p, ) , pop  =  o.

(1.23)

as has been shown in ref.[2] the v.e.v of the o+ operator per unit volume coincides with the
magnetic monopole condensate ho+i = h (0)(0)i:

ho+i =

where v is a normalization volume. in turn, one can show that hoi = 0. this conrms the
parity conservation in the mnjl model.

this eective lagrangian should be used for the evaluation of dierent observables dened in
terms of vacuum expectation values related to the magnetic monopole green functions [14].
magnetic monopole green functions. the npoint magnetic monopole green function can
be dened as the vacuum expectation value of the time ordered product of the massless magnetic
monopole densities refs.[14]:

g (x1, . . . , xn) = h0|t( (x1)1(x1) . . . (xn) n (xn))|0iconn. ,

(1.29)

where i(i = 1, . . . , n) are the dirac matrices. as has been shown in ref.[11] the vacuum
expectation value eq.(1.29) can be represented in terms of the vacuum expectation values of the
densities of the massive magnetic monopole elds m (x) coupled to the elds of the collective

condensed phase and |0i the wave function of the perturbative vacuum of the noncondensed

the selfinteractions lint[(x)] provide eld loop contributions and can be dropped out
in the tree eld approximation refs.
[14]. the tree eld approximation can be justied
keeping massive magnetic monopoles very heavy, i.e. m  mc. this corresponds to the london
limit m = 2 m  mc in the dual higgs model with dual dirac strings [810]. the inequality
m  mc means also that in the mnjl model we deal with dual superconductivity of type ii
[12]. in the tree eld approximation the r.h.s. of eq.(1.30) can be recast into the form

g(x1, . . . , xn) =< 0|t( (x1)1(x1) . . . (xn)n(xn))|0 >conn.=

(1.31)

for the subsequent investigation it is convenient to represent the r.h.s. of eq.(1.31) in terms of
the generating functional of the monopole green functions [14]

the paper is organized as follows.

in sect. 2 we discuss the gluon condensate in non
perturbative qcd both in the qcd sum rules approach and in lattice simulations. in sect. 3
we calculate the dualvector eld condensate and compare the obtained result with the gluon
condensate of nonperturbative qcd. in the conclusion we discuss the obtained results.

strength, has been introduced as a phenomenological parameter characterizing quantitatively
nontrivial properties of a nonperturbative vacuum of qcd in the qcd sum rules approach
[13]. the gluon condensate breaks the dilatation invariance at a scale of energy transferred of
order d  4 gev [14]. this gives a signal to the breaking of chiral symmetry which becomes
broken spontaneously at a scale of energy transferred of order   1 gev [14]. as has been
shown in ref.[15] the contribution of the gluon condensate to the condensate of light quarks
u, d and s makes up 1/3 of the meanvalue of the quark condensate huui = h ddi = hssi =
(0.253 gev)3 [15].

the coecient w40 describes a perturbative contribution to the gluon condensate, whilst the
coecients w40 and w22 are fully nonperturbative. the presence of the term proportional to
2
qcd/2
u diers the expression for the gluon condensate obtained within the diluteinstanton
gas approximation from the gluon condensate calculated on lattice. the appearance of this
term is related to power corrections [13,21], whereas the expression eq.(2.10) corresponds to the
leading order contribution in power expansion [13]. the gluon condensate given by eqs.(2.10)
and (2.11) we would compare with the condensate of the dualvector eld c which we calculate
below in the mnjl model.

in the mnjl model we dened the condensate of the dualvector eld c by analogy with the
magnetic monopole condensate [24]

recall that we are working in the london limit, m = 2 m  mc. one can show that in this
limit the contribution of the  eld exchanges to the dualvector eld condensate are insignicant
and can be neglected with respect to the contributions of the dualvector eld exchanges. as a
result the integral over the  eld can be absorbed by the normalization constant z

the dependence of the dualvector eld condensate on the shape of a dual dirac string enters
through the term f [e(x)] f [e(x)].

since the connement regime can be described by static innitely long dual dirac strings, we
would make an estimate of the numerical value of the dualvector eld condensate in the approx-
imation of the innitely long dual dirac string strained along the zaxis. in this approximation
the electric eld of a static dual dirac string is given by [8]

~e(~r ) = ~ez q (2)(~r ),

(3.28)

where ~r is the radiusvector in the plane perpendicular to the zaxis. the dualvector potential
possesses only the azimuthal component and reads [8]

c(r) = 

qmc

2

k1(mcr),

(3.29)

where k1(mcr) is the mcdonald function. the dual electric eld induced by an innitely long

at r  0 the dualvector eld condensate is innite. however, as has been noted in refs.[24]
in the mnjl model as well as in the dual higgs model with dual dirac strings [810] the minimal
transversal distances are restricted by inequality r  1/m = 1/2m . thus, at r = 1/2m we get
the maximal value of the dualvector eld condensate, since the contributions of the dual dirac
string described by the terms proportional to k 2
0 (m cr) and r k0(mcr) k1(mc r) are positive.

we should emphasize that unlike the magnetic monopole condensate the dualvector eld con-
densate does not vanish in the close vicinity of a dual dirac string [3,4].

4 conclusion

the evaluation of the dualvector eld condensate in the mnjl model has conrmed our state-
ment we have pointed out in refs.[24,9,10] that quantum uctuations of the elds of monopole
(anti)monopole collective excitations around the abrikosov ux lines induced by dual dirac
strings in the condensed phase play an important role for the undestanding of the connement
mechanism. we have shown that these uctuations determine fully the dualvector eld con-
densate independent on the shape of a dual dirac string and nonvanishing at large distances.
in the case of the neglect of quantum eld uctuations this part of the dualvector eld

condensate does not appear and the condensate is dened by

(4.1)

for the innitely long static dual dirac string strained along the zaxis.

unlike eq.(3.32) the dualvector eld condensate given by eq.(4.1) vanishes at large distances
in the plane transversal to a dual dirac string. this result should contradict to the gluon
condensate having a nonvanishing part at large distances.

when matching our expression for the dualvector eld condensate given by eq.(3.32) with
that calculated on lattice we would like to emphasize the absence of the perturbative term w40
and the presence of the term proportional to m 2/2 having a nonperturbative nature. the
absence of the perturbative contribution to the dualvector eld condensate is rather clear.
indeed, the evaluation of the dualvector eld condensate is carried out in the nonperturbative
(condensed) phase of the mnjl model with a nonperturbative dualsuperconducting vacuum
lled with dual dirac strings. thereby, the perturbative contributions cannot appear in principle.
cm 2/4 are de-
termined fully by the dual dirac string. they vanish at large distances. at short distances

then, nonperturbative contributions having the structure m 4

c/4 and m 2

17

restricted from below by inequality r  1/m = 1/2m the contributions of these terms are
positive. due to this they increase the value of the nonstring part of the dualvector eld con-
densate in the vicinity of a dual dirac string. this result is opposite to that we have obtained
for the magnetic monopole condensate. unlike the dualvector eld condensate the magnetic
monopole condensate vanishes in the close vicinity of a dual dirac string [24].

c/4) o(g6) or (m 4

unfortunately, we could not derive with onetoone correspondence the contribution to the
dualvector eld condensate analogous to that caused by a diluteinstanton vacuum in the gluon
condensate. in the mnjl model according to the dirac quantization this contribution should
be of order (m 4
c /4) o(g6). such contributions can be found among other
terms in the part of the dualvector eld condensate depending on the shape of a dual dirac
string. however, these terms vanish at large distances and do not give a dominant contribution
to the dualvector eld condensate. thus, we can conclude that the nonperturbative dual
superconducting vacuum of the mnjl model possesses partly the properties of a diluteinstanton
gas vacuum but this part of the wave function of the nonperturbative vacuum does not play a
dominant role.
