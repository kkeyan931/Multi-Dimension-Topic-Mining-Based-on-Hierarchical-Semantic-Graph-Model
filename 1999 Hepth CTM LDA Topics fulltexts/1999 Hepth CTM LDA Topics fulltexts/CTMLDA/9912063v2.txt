abstract

the eective zero-brane action approach is generalized for arbitrary multi-
scalar elds. as an example, by virtue of this method we derive the non-
minimal particle action for the jackiw-teitelboim gravity at xed gauge in
the vicinity of the black hole solution as an instanton-dilaton doublet. when
quantizing it as the theory with higher derivatives, it is shown that the ap-
pearing quantum equation has su(2) dynamical symmetry group realizing
the exact spin-coordinate correspondence. finally, we calculate the quantum
corrections to the mass of the black hole.

i. introduction

the aim of this paper is to develop the classical and quantum eld-to-particle zero-brane
formalism for multiscalar eld theory in two-dimensional at spacetime (here and below
we will use the term zero-brane in the sense non-minimal point particle rather than
d-brane theory). then, as an example, we apply it to the particular 2d theory of gravity
admitting at certain parametrization the correspondence to some scalar eld theory acting
on at spacetime.

the jackiw-teitelboim dilaton gravity discovered in 1984 [1] can be obtained also as a
dimensional reduction of the 3d btz black hole [2,3] and spherically symmetric solution
of 4d dilaton einstein-maxwell gravity used as a model of evaporation process of a near-
extremal black hole [4]. in spite of the jt solution is locally dieomorphic to the desitter
space, it has all the global attributes of a black hole. besides, it is simply enough to obtain
main results in a non-perturbative way that seems to be important for highly non-linear
general relativity.

despite the wide literature devoted to classical and quantum aspects of the theory (see
refs. [57] and references therein), it concerns mainly with standard methods of study,
whereas it is clear that black holes are extended objects and thus should be correctly con-
sidered within frameworks of the brane theory where there is no rigid xation of spatial
symmetry. the quantum aspects were studied mainly in connection with group features of
jt dilaton gravity in general whereas we will quantize the theory in the vicinity of certain
non-trivial vacuum induced by a static solution with the emphasis on the corrections to mass
spectrum. thus, our purpose is to study the 2d dilaton gravity in the neighbourhood of
the classical and quantum jackiw-teitelboim black hole within the frameworks of the brane
approach, which consists in the constructing of the eective action where the non-minimal
terms (rst of all, depending on the world-volume curvature) are induced by the eld uc-
tuations. then the eective action evidently arises after nonlinear reparametrization of an
initial theory when excluding zero eld oscillations.

in sec.

the paper is arranged as follows.

ii we study the jt solution as a soliton-
dilaton (more correctly, instanton-dilaton) doublet and its properties on the classical level.
in sec. iii we generalize the approach [8] for arbitrary multiscalar elds and apply it for
jt dilaton gravity in xed-gauge (at-spacetime) formulation. minimizing the action with
respect to eld uctuations, we remove zero modes and obtain the point-particle action with
non-minimal terms corresponding to this theory. sec. iv is devoted to quantization of the
action as a constrained theory with higher derivatives. in result we obtain the schroedinger
wave equation describing wave function and mass spectrum of a point particle with curvature
and apply them for the jt black hole. then we calculate the zeroth and rst excited levels
to get the mass of the quantum jt black hole with quantum corrections. conclusions are
made in sec. v.

ii. jackiw-teitelboim gravity

consider the action of jackiw-teitelboim dilaton gravity

sjt [, g] =

1

2gz d2xg (r + 2m2),

2

(2.1)

where g is the gravitational coupling constant, dimensionless in 2d case. extremalizing this
action with respect to metric and dilaton eld variations we obtain the following equations
of motion

r + 2m2 = 0,

(cid:16)  m2g(cid:17)  = 0.

further, if one performs the parametrization of a metric

ds2 =  sin2(u/2)dt2 + cos2(u/2)dx2,

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

and puts the metric anzats into eqs. (2.1)-(2.3), they can be rewritten [5], respectively, as

sjt [, u] =

1

2gz d2x (u  m2 sin u),

u  m2 sin u = 0,
(cid:16)  m2 cos u(cid:17)  = 0,

where  is the at euclidean laplacian, 2

t2 + 2

x2.

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

if we wish to choose from the solutions of eq. (2.6) only the one-instanton ones, we have

the following instanton-dilaton pair:

u(s)(x, t) = 4 arctan exp (m),
 (s)(x, t) = c1 sech (m) + c2 [sinh (m) + m sech (m)] ,

(2.8)
(2.9)

where ci are arbitrary constants,  = (x vt), 1/ = 1 + v2. then the metric (2.4) after
the transformation {x, t}  {r, t}, such that
2gm "dt

cosech2 (m)  v2 d# ,

v/

dt = vs m

r =

where m is an arbitrary constant, can be rewritten in the explicit form representing jt
black hole solution

ds2 = (cid:18)m2r2 

2gm

m (cid:19) dt 2 +(cid:18)m2r2 

2gm

m (cid:19)1

dr2,

having the following energy and event horizon

ebh = m, rbh =s 2gm

m3

.

(2.10)

(2.11)

the our purpose now is to take into account the eld uctuations in the neighborhood of this
solution and to construct the eective action of the jt black hole as a zero-brane. before
we go further, one should develop some general approach.

iii. effective action

in this section we will construct the nonlinear eective action of an arbitrary multiscalar
2d theory in the vicinity of a solitary-wave solution, and then apply it for jt dilaton gravity.
in fact, here we will describe the procedure of the correct transition from eld to particle
degrees of freedom. indeed, despite the solitary-wave solution resembles a particle both at
classical and quantum levels, it yet remains to be a eld solution with innite number of
eld degrees of freedom whereas a true particle has a nite number of degrees of freedom.
therefore, we are obliged to correctly handle this circumstance (and several others) otherwise
deep contradictions may appear.

a. general formalism

let us consider the action describing n scalar elds

s[] =z l() d2x,

suppose, we have a solution in the class of solitary waves

a () = (s)

coinciding with the total energy up to the lorentz factor .

let us change to the set of the collective coordinates {0 = s, 1 = } such that

xm = xm(s) + em

(1)(s), a(x, t) = ea(),

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

where xm(s) turn to be the coordinates of a (1+1)-dimensional point particle, em
(1)(s) is the
unit spacelike vector orthogonal to the world line. hence, the action (3.1) can be rewritten
in new coordinates as

1

s[e] =z l(e)  d2,

l(e) =

and k is the curvature of a particle world line

(3.9)

where mn is the unit antisymmetric tensor. this new action contains the n redundant
degrees of freedom which eventually lead to appearance of the so-called zero modes. to
eliminate them we must constrain the model by means of the condition of vanishing of the
functional derivative with respect to eld uctuations about a chosen static solution, and in
result we will obtain the required eective action.

(3.15)

(3.16)

strictly speaking, the explicit form of ga() is not signicant for us, because we always can
suppose integration constants to be zero thus restricting ourselves by the special solution.
nevertheless, the homogeneous system should be considered as the eigenvalue problem for
c (see below).

substituting the found functions a = kfa back in the action (3.11), we can rewrite it

where the second term can be integrated as a full derivative. therefore, even if it is non-

(3.11) or adding of an appropriate counterterm to the action (3.8):

thus, we obtain the nal form of the eective zero-brane action of the theory

(3.23)

hence one can see that eq. (3.13) was nothing but this equation in the linear approximation
k  1, as was expected.
thus, the only problem which yet demands on the resolving is the determination of
eigenvalue c. it turns to be the stourm-liouville problem for the system (3.16) under some
chosen boundary conditions. if one supposes, for instance, the niteness of g at innity then
the c spectrum turns to be discrete. moreover, it often happens that c has only one or two
admissible values2.

be that as it may, the exact value of c is necessary hence the system (3.16) should be
resolved as exactly as possible. let us consider it more closely. the main problem there is
the functions ga are mixed between equations. to separate them, let us recall that there
exist n  1 orbit equations, whose varying resolves the separation problem. we consider
this for the case n = 2, i.e., for a biscalar theory, all the more so it will be helpful when
applying for jt gravity.

considering (3.15), the varying of a single orbit equation yields

2for instance, in the works [8] (one-scalar 4 theory) or [9] (3 and liouville model), where the
special cases of this formalism were used, c has the form m2 where  is a single positive half-integer
or integer; the cases with c < 0 does not have, as a rule, independent physical sense, because at
quantization they either can be interpreted in terms of antiparticles or appear to be unphysical at
all.

b. in this form it is much easily to resolve the eigenvalue problem.

a =xb

therefore, the two independent parameters for the action (3.22),  and c, can be determined
immediately by virtue of eqs. (3.6) and (3.25).

finally, it should be pointed out that the developed method can be (comparatively)
easily generalized both in the qualitative direction (considering it for the yang-mills and
spinor lagrangians [16]) and toward the increasing of dimensions, thereby in the latter case
one would expect the brane actions complemented with non-minimal terms, rst of all,

depending on the external curvature, r d pg( + k 2).

b. application for jt black hole

for further it is convenient to perform the wick rotation and to work in terms of solitons
and lorentzian time rather then in terms of instantons and euclidean time, all the more
so the main results of the previous subsection are independent of v. omitting topological
surface terms, we will consider instead of the action (2.5) its lorentzian analogue

sjt [, u] =

1

2gz d2x(m mu  m2 sin u).

the soliton-dilaton doublet (2.8), (2.9) has the localized energy density (3.5)

(x, t) =

cosh2 (m)

,

and can be interpreted as the relativistic point particle with the energy

eclass =

,

i.e. the integral (3.6) is nite and coincides with the energy (2.11)

 = m,

(3.26)

(3.27)

(3.28)

if one redenes c2.

the action (3.26) always can be linearly rearranged in the form (3.1), (3.2), if we intro-

duce elds a such that

2u = 1  i2,

 / = 1 + i2,

(3.29)

where  is an arbitrary real constant which (similarly to c1) will not aect on nal results.
we will suppose the nal zero-brane action (3.22), and the main task now is to determine
its parameters. we have  already determined by (3.28), and the eigenvalue c remains to
be the only unknown parameter for eq. (3.22).

for eqs. (3.25) we will require the traditional boundary conditions

ga(+)  ga() = o(1),

(3.30)

8

whereas provided eqs. (2.8), (2.9), (3.29) the system (3.25) have the form

where

 g 

a + (ka  c) ga = 0,

m2

a1( cosh2 (m)  2) + c2 cosh5 (m) + a2(6  cosh2 (m))

k1 =

cosh2 (m)
k2 = k1|cici,
a1 = cosh (m) (42 + 3c2), a2 = sinh (m) (c1 + c2m),

cosh (m) (42 + c2 + c2 cosh2 (m))  a2

(3.31)

,

hence it is clear that

ka(0) = m2, ka() = ka(+) = m2.

(3.32)

this eigenvalue equation is evidently hard to solve exactly, hence we use the method of the
approximing potential which would have the main properties of ka especially those presented
by (3.32). besides, we will consider the equation for k1 only because both potentials have
approximately the same behaviour.

thus, omitting the index we will assume the following eigenvalue equation

 g  + m2 1 

2

cosh2 (m)! g  cg = 0,

(3.33)

instead of eq. (3.31). its potential has the main features of ka but appears to be exactly
solvable: according to the proven theorem (see appendix a), the only admissible non-zero
c is

c = m2.

(3.34)

this result is conrmed also by the quasiclassical approximation.

indeed, the necessary

appears to be the following one

which yields eq. (3.34) again.

therefore, the eective zero-brane action of the dilaton gravity about jackiw-teitelboim

black hole with uctuational corrections is

(3.35)

in the next section we will quantize it to obtain the quantum corrections to the mass of
xed-gauge jt black hole.

iv. quantization

in the previous section we obtained a classical eective action for the model in question.
thus, to quantize it we must consecutively construct the hamiltonian structure of dynamics
of the point particle with curvature [10].

a. general formalism

from the brane action (3.22) and denition of the world-line curvature one can see that we
have the theory with higher derivatives [11,12]. hence, below we will treat the coordinates
and momenta as the canonically independent coordinates of phase space. besides, the
hessian matrix constructed from the derivatives with respect to accelerations,

appears to be singular that says about the presence of the constraints on phase variables of
the theory.

as was mentioned, the phase space consists of the two pairs of canonical variables:

xm, pm =

besides we should add the proper time gauge condition,

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

to remove the non-physical gauge degree of freedom. then, when introducing the new
variables,

g =qq2  1  0,

10

(4.8)

(4.9)

(4.10)

the constraints can be rewritten in the form

 =qq2, v = arctanh(cid:16)p(1)/p(0)(cid:17) ,

2 = "qp2 cosh v +

hence nally we obtain the constraint

2 = qp2 cosh v +

which in the quantum theory (v = i/v) yields
b2|i = 0.

2
v  0,

as was shown in ref. [8] (see also ref. [11]), the constraint 2 on the quantum level admits
several coordinate representations that, generally speaking, lead to dierent nonequivalent

theories, therefore, the choice between the dierent forms of b2 should be based on the

physical relevance. then the physically admissible equation determining quantum dynamics
of the quantum kink and bell particles has the form:

(4.11)

(4.12)

(4.13)

and s = 0 in our case.

as was established in the works [13,14], su(2) has to be the dynamical symmetry group

for this hamiltonian which can be rewritten in the form of the spin hamiltonian

where the spin operators,

besides

in this connection it should be noted that though the reformulation of some interaction
concerning the coordinate degrees of freedom in terms of spin variables is widely used (e.g.,
in the theories with the heisenberg hamiltonian, see ref. [15]), it has to be just the physical
approximation as a rule, whereas in our case the spin-coordinate correspondence is exact.
further, at s  0 there exists an irreducible (2s + 1)-dimensional subspace of the repre-
sentation space of the su(2) lie algebra, which is invariant with respect to these operators.
determining eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the spin hamiltonian in the matrix representa-
tion which is realized in this subspace, one can prove that the solution of eq. (4.11) is the
function

() = exp(cid:18)

cs+1 = cs1 = 0,  = s,  s + 1, ..., s.

however, it should be noted that these expressions give only the nite number of exact
solutions which is equal to the dimensionality of the invariant subspace (this is the so-called
qess, quasi-exactly solvable system). therefore, for the spin s = 0 we can nd only the
ground state wave function and eigenvalue:

0() = c1 exp(cid:18)

b
2

cosh (cid:19), 0 = 0.

(4.17)

hence, we obtain that the ground-state mass of the quantum particle with curvature coin-
cides with the classical one,

m0 = ,

(4.18)

as was expected.

further, in absence of exact wave functions for more excited levels one can nd the
rst (small) quantum correction to mass in the approximation of the quantum harmonic
oscillator. it is easy to see that at b  1 the (eective) potential

2(cid:19)2
v () =(cid:18)b

sinh2 

b

12

(4.19)

has the single minimum

vmin = b/2 at min = 0.

then following to the h-expansion technique we shift the origin of coordinates in the
point of minimum (to satisfy  = 0 = 0 in absence of quantum oscillations), and expand v
in the taylor series to second order near the origin thus reducing the model to the oscillator
of the unit mass, energy /2 and oscillation frequency

therefore, the quantization rules yield the discrete spectrum

 =

1

2qb(b  1).

 =qb(b  1)(n + 1/2) + o(h2), n = 0, 1, 2, ...,

(4.20)

and the rst quantum correction to particle masses will be determined by the lower energy
of oscillations:

 =

1

2qb(b  1) + o(h2),

that gives the algebraic equation for m as a function of m and .

we can easily resolve it in the approximation

which is admissible for the major physical cases, and obtain

b  1  c/2  0,

that after considering of eqs. (4.13) and (4.18) yields

then one can seek for mass in the form m =  +  (  ), and nally we obtain the mass
of a particle with curvature (3.22) with rst-order quantum corrections

m =  

c
2

+ o(h2c/2).

(4.25)

the nature of the justied choice of the root sign before the second term is not so clear as
it seems for a rst look, because there exist the two historically interfering arguments. the
rst (physical) one is: if we apply this formalism for the one-scalar 4 model [8] and compare
the result with that obtained in other ways [17], we should suppose the sign +. however,
the second, mathematical, counterargument is as follows: the known exact spectra of the
operators with the qes potentials like (4.11) are split, as a rule by virtue of radicals, hence
the signs  can approximately represent such a bifurcation and thus should be unharmed.
if it is really so, quantum uctuations should divide the classically unied particle with
curvature into several subtypes with respect to mass.

finally, comparing the rst term (4.25) and the estimate (4.22), one can see that the
obtained spectrum is nonperturbative and can not be derived by virtue of the taylor series
with respect to 1/.

b. mass of quantum jt black hole

thus, considering eqs. (3.35) and (4.25), the mass of quantum jt black hole as a soliton-

dilaton boson in the rst approximation is

m = m  m/2 + o(m2/m 2),

(4.26)

therefore, the approximation (4.22) has to be justied in this case. the problem of the
obtaining of further corrections turns to be reduced to the mathematically standard stourm-
liouville problem for the razavi potential, all the more so the latter is well-like on the whole
axis and hence admits only the bound states with a discrete spectrum.

finally, it should be noted that we quantized the reduced theory (3.26) rather than
complete dilaton gravity because in general case the latter has two rst-class constraints
which were removed by xed metric gauge. besides, unlike the previous works we quantized
the theory about the static solution rather than in the neigbourhood of trivial vacuum, and
were interested rst of all in obtaining of mass spectrum. the question of the construction of
corresponding formalism for dilaton gravity in general case remains open because it requires
the consistent generalization of eld-to-particle procedure for the case of elds in curved
spacetime.

v. conclusion

let us enumerate the main items studied.

it was shown that the jackiw-teitelboim
dilaton gravity can be reduced to biscalar theory admitting the doublet consisting of in-
stanton and dilaton components, which can be interpreted as a massive quantum particle.
further, considering eld uctuations in the neighborhood of the jt black hole it was ruled
out the action for this eld doublet as a non-minimal point particle with curvature, thereby
we generalized the procedure of obtaining of brane actions for the multiscalar case. (from
the fact, that the (1+1)-dimensional dilaton gravity yields the eective action for jt black
hole as a spatially zero-dimensional brane (nonminimal point particle), we can conclude that
the ordinary black hole (in the case of the arbitrary symmetry and eld uctuations in a
neighborhood) should be consecutively described within frameworks of a ve-dimensional
eld theory.)

when quantizing this action as the constrained theory with higher derivatives, it was
shown that the resulting schroedinger equation is the special case of that with the razavi
potential having su(2) dynamical symmetry group in the ground state. finally, we found
the rst quantum correction to mass of the jackiw-teitelboim black hole which could not
be calculated by means of the perturbation theory.

using the asymptotics of the hypergeometric functions in the neighborhood z = 1, it is
straightforward to derive that the rst from the conditions (a4) will be satised if we

further, to specify the parameters at which this function satises with the second condition
(a4) we should consider the asymptotical behavior of f (reg) near innity. we have

from this expression it can easily be seen that f (reg) diverges at innity everywhere except
perhaps the points:

ec = (2n)2 = 0, 4, 16, ..., and ec = 1,

and so on. by induction it is clear that at ec  4 there are no ci at which f would satisfy

with the requirements (a2).
