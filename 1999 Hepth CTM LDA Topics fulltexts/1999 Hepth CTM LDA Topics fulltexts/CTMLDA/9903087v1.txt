talk given at the workshop integrability: the seiberg-witten and whitham equations

edinburgh, september 1998

abstract

review of the theory of eective actions and the hypothetical origins of

integrability in seiberg-witten theory.

this conference is devoted to remarkable links between the recently dis-
covered seiberg-witten ansatz [1] for the low-energy eective action of n = 2
supersymmetric yang-mills theories in 4 and 5 space-time dimensions and
the old theory of classical (0+1)-dimensional integrable systems, based on
the notions of lax representations and spectral riemann surfaces. the ba-
sic question about this whole subject is why at all integrability properties
should arise in the study of high-dimensional models, and it remains ob-
scure and even non-addressed in most publications. still, in [2] integrability
has been deliberately searched for  and found  as the hidden structure
behind the seiberg-witten ansatz. it is the goal of this brief presentation
to collect the implicit arguments in favor of the a priori existence of a hid-
den integrable structure. these arguments are non-convincing and some-
what non-constructive, still they deserve being kept in mind in the study of
seiberg-witten theory and its predecessors (like matrix models) and possible
generalizations.

1. why integrability?
the question about the origins of integrability in seiberg-witten theory
is in fact a part of the broader question: what is the role of integrability in

1

physics? dierent people would give dierent answers to this question, and
most of them would choose between the following options:

- integrable models provide funny examples.
- these exactly solvable examples can be (and actually are) used as the
starting points for perturbative expansions describing approximately the re-
ally relevant physical models.

- whatever is solvable is integrable, i.e. if anybody succeeded in providing
exact solution to some physical model, there should be a (hidden) integrable
structure in this model, responsible for the very possibility to solve it. this
a posteriory integrability principle, while certainly true, is not very interest-
ing: we would prefer to know about the existence of integrable structure in
advance.

- integrability theory is rather a branch of mathematics (group theory),

and can be of little physical signicance.

what we are going to advocate in the present notes is a less obvious

hypothesis: integrability is the general property of eective actions.

however, in order to understand this hypothesis it is important to have

an adequately adjusted (and broad enough) notion of integrability.

2. what is integrability? [3, 4]
eective actions are functional integrals like

z{t|0}  z0

d es(t|)

(1)

these quantities depend on two types of variables: on the shape of the bare
action s() and on the boundary conditions 0 for integration variables
(elds) . in physical language these are respectively dependencies on the
coupling constants t and on the choice of vacuum 0.

obviously, being a result of integration, an (exponentiated) eective ac-
tion z exhibits peculiar features, unfamiliar from the studies of other classes
of objects in quantum eld theory and mathematical physics. identication
of such features should be the key to characterization of the new class of spe-
cial functions, which will be used to represent the answers to any questions
in non-perturbative quantum eld (string) theory.

among already discovered, the most important are the two peculiarities
[4]: (i) covariance of z under variation of the coupling constants (the shape
of s()), reecting invariance of an integral under a change of integration

2

variables (elds) , and (ii) certain relation between the dependencies of z
on the shape s() and on the choice of the vacuum (boundary conditions)
0, reecting dependence of vacuum states on the shape of the action.

the feature (i) turns to imply that eective actions exhibit a (hidden)
integrable structure and hypothetically eective actions are (always?) the
(generalized)  -functions of integrable hierarchies.

so far, we have a restricted set of examples where this hypothesis is

explicitly formulated and checked:

- ordinary matrix models. here one can straightforwardly study the t-
dependence of matrix integrals and nd the links to the simplest kp/toda-
like  -functions.

- character formulas and chern-simons theory. here the dependence on
boundary conditions can be investigated and again the links with kp/toda
 -functions are easily established. this result can be less expected than the
previous one, still it is true.

- generalized kontsevich model (gkm). the gkm theory allows to

study the interplay between the t- and 0-dependencies.

- seiberg-witten conjecture and donaldson n=4 susy 4d yang-mills
model (the topological 4d yang-mills theory). in this context the quasiclas-
sical (whitham)  -functions enter the game.

all these examples are distinguished by the property that relevant  -
functions belong to the well studied kp/toda family (i.e. are associated with
u(1)k=1). new examples can be discovered
the simplest kac-moody algebra
after further advances in the theory of geometrical quantization when the
notion of  -functions for other groups becomes more familiar.

3. ordinary matrix model [5, 6, 4].
in this case the role of the functional integral is played by an ordinary

integral over n  n hermitean matrices :

z{t} = z dn 2

 exp  
xk=0

tktrk!

(2)

invariance of the integral under arbitrary change of integration variable
  f () leads to covariance of z{t} under the change of its arguments: the
coupling constants tk. namely [6], if  = n+1, then the action s() =

trpk tkk changes by s = trpk ktkk+n, and  if  is a number, not a

3

matrix  this variation can be reinterpreted as the result of the change of
t-variables: tk+n = ktk. this implies the relation like z{t}  z{t + t}.
such relation would imply that z{t} is actually independent of t. in fact,
one should also take into account the change of the measure d under the
variation of , and exact statement, expressing covariance of z{t}, is:

ln =

lnz = 0

for n  1,



xk=0

ktk



tk+n

+ xa+b=n

2

tatb

(3)

this covariance still implies that z{t} is essentially independent of its argu-
ments tk, but exact statement is that the dependence exists, but is of a very
peculiar form:

z{t} = kp {t|g0},

(4)

i.e. z{t} is a kp  -function at some special point g0 of the universal
u(1)k=1). this statement can
grassmannian (particular group element of
be checked by explicit evaluation of the matrix integral [5] in the formalism
of orthogonal polynomials.

thus, dependence of eective action on the coupling constants can be

represented in terms of the  -functions.

4. generalized  -functions and dependencies on the boundary

conditions.

generalized  -function [7] is a generating function for all the matrix ele-

ments of a given group element g in a given representation r:

r(t|g) = h0|etaj a

g|0ir

(5)

here ta are parameters of the generating function and j a are generators of
the lie algebra under consideration.

as already mentioned, the conventional kp/toda-like  functions are
associated with the free fermion realization of the simplest ane algebra
 . here c is a riemann surface (complex

u(1)k=1: j(z) = (z), s = rc
curve), which can be used instead of the group element g = exppm,n amn mn

in the denition of  for ane (1-loop) algebras. also, in this case it is con-
venient to parametrize the set of t-variables by a single function a:

kp ( a|c) = hexp(cid:18)zc

aj(cid:19)ic

4

(6)

the standard form of kp tau-function is a particular case of this one, asso-

ciated with a = ,  = p

k=0 tk(z  z0)(k+1).

the same kp  -function can be alternatively represented in terms of a
topological three-dimensional eld theory: abelian chern-simons model [8]
(this is a simple example of the ads/cft-correspondence [9]):

where

kp ( a|c) = zam =c= a

da exp scs,

scs = zm

ada +im

a a

(7)

(8)

and m is the lled riemann surface c  the 3d manifold with the boundary
c.

this identity illustrates the important hypothesis: the boundary condi-
tions dependence of the functional integral (that of the chern-simons theory
in this particular example) can be also (like that on the coupling constants)
represented in terms of the  -functions. it may be not so surprising, because
the dependencies on coupling constants and boundary conditions are in fact
deeply interrelated.

5. generalized kontsevich model [10, 11, 4].
this interrelation can be illustrated with the example of generalized
kontsevich model (gkm), dened as the matrix integral over n  n her-
mitean matrices x,

zgkm {l|vp+1} = cz dn2

x etr(vp+1(x)+xl)

(9)

here l is a nn hermitean matrix and vp+1(x) is a polynomial of degree p+1,
its derivative wp(x) = v 
p+1(x) is a polynomial of degree p. in gkm theory
one introduces two sets of time-variables to parametrize the dependencies
on l and on the shape of vp+1(x):

tk 

1
k

trk,

tk 

1
k

trk, l = wp() = p

and [12]

tk =

p

k(p  k)

resw 1k/p

p

()d

5

(10)

(11)

in (9) c is a prefactor used to cancel the quasiclassical contribution to the
integral around the saddle point x = ,

c = exp(cid:16)trvp+1()  trv 

p+1()(cid:17) det1/2vp+1()

the central result of the gkm theory is that [11]

zgkm {l|vp+1} = efp( tk|tk)p( tk + tk)

(12)

(13)

where p is a  -function of the p-reduced kp hierarchy, and the shape of
u(1))
p as a function of time-variables (i.e. the associated group element of
depends only on degree p and not on the shape of the polynomial wp(x).
the exponential factor in (13) contains

fp( tk|tk) =

1

aij(t)( ti + ti)( tj + tj),

2 xi,j
aij = res w i/p()dw j/p

+ ()

(14)

which is a quasiclassical (whitham)  -function.

at the rst glance this gkm example does not seem very close to (1):
neither of the two types of variables in (9)  the shape of vp+1 and the ma-
trix l  is obviously interpreted as a boundary condition or vacuum. instead
the whole expression (9) looks very much like a (matrix) fourier transform,
and the interrelation like (13) between the l- and vp+1-dependencies, which
puts them essentially on equal footing, is not too surprising: usually the
dependence of fourier transform (z) on its argument (l) contains entire
information about the shape of transformed function (evp+1(x)). however,
the gkm example can be not so irrelevant for our consideration. as shown
in [13], the gkm partition function (9) can be a natural member (the over-
simplied case, associated with the genus-zero spectral curve) of the family
of the seiberg-witten prepotentials, which are clearly the quantities of the
type (1).

6. the low energy eective actions.
the low energy eective actions describe the eective dynamics of light
modes, arising after all the heavy modes are integrated away. in the case of
the seiberg-witten theory the light modes are abelian supermultiplets (their
lowest components parametrize the valleys in the potential, i.e. the moduli

6

r d3xtr(ada+ 2

space of vacua) and the chern-simons degree of freedom (not a eld!) k =
3a3), peculiar for yang-mills theories in four dimensions with
the property that (non-perturbative) eective potential is always a periodic
function of k. it remains an unresolved problem to derive the low-energy
eective action for the uctuations along the valleys in interaction with the
dynamics in k-direction  which should be just a (0+1)-dimensional problem
 directly from the non-perturbative n = 2 susy yang-mills theory. still
one can attempt to guess what the transition to the low-energy eective
actions should mean from the point of view of the  -functions.

normally, in higher-dimensional eld theories the functional integrals de-
pend on additional parameter: the normalization point , which is the ir
cuto in the integration over uctuations with dierent momenta. eective
action with a given  describes the eective dynamics of excitations with
wavelenghts exceeding 1. the low-energy eective action arises in the
limit   0, when only nite number of excitations (the zero-modes of the
massless elds) remain relevant. of course, dierent theories can possess the
same low-energy action (e.g.
in all the theories without massless particles
there are no degrees of freedom, surviving in the low-energy approximation,
and the low-energy eective action is just zero for all of them): these actions
are pertinent for universality classes rather than for particular eld theory
models. as usual in the study of universality classes it is instructive to
look for the simplest representative of the given class. the matrix integrals,
which are (0+0)-dimensional models are such simplest representatives of the
class, which also contains the 2d topological sigma-models interacting with
2d gravity. similarly, the seiberg-witten conjecture can be interpreted so
that n = 2 susy yang-mills models belong to universality class, of which
the simplest representatives are the (0+1)-dimensional integrable systems.

the natural hypothesis (suggested in [2]) about interpretation of the low-

energy eective actions in terms of the  -functions states that:

- the low-energy eective actions are quasiclassical (whitham)  -functions.
- the proper coordinates (the at structure) on the moduli space of vacua

are provided by the adiabatic invariants (ac = hc ~pd~q).

- the time-variables, associated with the low-energy correlators (i.e. renor-
malized coupling constants) are whitham times (the deformations of sym-
plectic structure).

the seiberg-witten theory provides us with two kinds of pieces of evi-

dence in support of this hypothesis:

7

- dynamics of branes seems to imply the shapes of the spectral curves

and their period matrices [14, 15, 16].

- the correlation functions in donaldson theory seem to be indeed de-

scribed in terms of the relevant whitham tau-functions [18, 13].

7. dynamics of 5-branes [14, 17, 15, 16].
the fundamental object associated with the d = 11 supergravity  and
thus, presumably, with entire m-theory  is a membrane, i.e. a 2-brane.
its dual  which should be equally fundamental  is a 5-brane with a 6-
dimensional world volume. in the rst-quantization approach dynamics of
a 5-brane is thus described in terms of some 6d eld theory, which  as a
rst choice  can be either a non-abelian super-yang-mills model or that of
abelian self-dual 2-forms. if the topology of the world volume is r4  c one
gets a family of 4d yang-mills models, parametrized by the choice of vacua,
labeled by riemann surfaces c. the possible choice of c is restricted by the
equations of motion of the 6d theory. according to [15], these equations for
6d super-yang-mills model, provide c in the form of the spectral curve,

c :

det (l()  ) = 0

(15)

with the at coordinates on the moduli space of such curves dened as ac =

hc . if one further considers the theory of abelian 2-forms on such curves,

one immediately gets [14] the seiberg-witten prepotential (the n = 2 susy
substitute of the low-energy eective action) f (aa), of which the second
derivative is the period matrix of the spectral curve c: ab = calf /aa,
t = ab/aa.

eq.(15) is in fact the equation of motion for scalar elds ij in the 6d

super-yang-mills theories:

d2 = fermionic v.e.v.

(16)

for the topology r9  t with 2d torus t (the bare spectral curve) and the
5-brane wrapped around the torus, this equation becomes (in appropriate
gauge a = 0 and aij = diag(ai))

(  + a)() = source

(17)

if there is no source at the r.h.s., ij = const  this is the case of unbroken
n = 4 supersymmetry in four dimensions. breakdown of supersymmetry

8

(down to n = 2 as result, say, of non-trivial boundary conditions imposed
along t on some elds) somehow produces non-vanishing source at the r.h.s.
if, for example, the source is a -function, m(1  ij)(2)(  0), then

lij = ij  d

piij + m(1  ij)

(cid:16)  0 + im 

 (ai  aj)(cid:17)

(  0)

(18)




this is the lax operator of elliptic calogero model.

in the double-scaling (inosemtsevs) limit m  ,   i, 2n =

m2n e2i the spectral equation

turns into familiar equation for the toda-chain system:

det(cid:16)l(z)  (cid:17) = 0

z +

1
z

= w (),

 = 

dz
z

(19)

(20)

where w () is a polynomial of degree n and z  e2i.

thus we see, that the brane dynamics forces the brane, wrapped around
the bare spectral curve (with some susy breaking boundary conditions), to
split its n sheets in such a way as to form the full spectral curve.

8. correlation functions for n = 2 susy ym in 4d.
the main observables in donaldson theory are made from the scalar elds
: the lowest components of the supermultiplets. if ok = tr k, of interest
are the quantities

ck1...kn = hok1 . . . okni

the ordinary anomalies in yang-mills theory, like

imply that

j 5

 = trf f ,
 = trf 2






ck1...kn = c2 k1...kn,

9

(21)

(22)

(23)

in particular






hoki = ho2oki

(24)

in [18] the correlation functions ho2oki were explicitly evaluated by
methods of donaldson theory as functions of the moduli.
in [13] it was
shown that these answers are indeed consistent with interpretation in terms
of whitham  -functions, which implies that

hok1 . . . okni =

nf (a, t )
tk1 . . . tkn

(25)

the prepotential (whitham  -function) f and the whitham times t are
introduced by the following construction [12, 19, 20, 13]. the dierential
ds =  which is the eigenvalue of the lax matrix 1-form lij = ij has the
property that

ds

moduli

= holomorphic dierential on c

(26)

if one allows c to have punctures, then holomorphic means that the rst-
order poles are allowed at punctures. if punctures collide, the higher order
poles are allowed. ds can be now deformed:

ds =  +x tkd k

(27)

where d k has a pole of degree k + 1 at a given point. one can now include
the cycles going around the punctures into the set of a-cycles and those going
between the punctures into the set of b-cycles. the enlarged period matrix
tkl can be used to dene the prepotential:

tkl = tlk =

2f

tk tl

(28)

the prepotential itself is given by the sum over the enlarged set of a and b
cycles:

f =

1

2 xk iak

dsibk

ds

10

(29)

presumably it should satisfy the generalized wdvv equations [21].

in the case of the toda chain one can explicitly evaluate the period matrix

[13]:

2f

tmtn

= 



2i  hm+1,n+1 +


mn

hm+1,n+1 = 

ai
n
mn

hm+1

hn+1
aj 2

ij log e(~0)! ,

resw n/n ()dw m/n

+

()

(30)

this result is in agreement with the calculation of [18]. on the other hand,
it is obviously a direct generalization of eq.(14) in the case of gkm.
