abstract

the integrability of the n -cosine model, a n -eld generalization of
the sine-gordon model, is investigated. we establish to rst order in
conformal perturbation theory that, for arbitrary n , the model pos-
sesses a quantum conserved current of lorentz spin 3 on a submanifold
of the parameter space where the interaction becomes marginal. the
integrability of the model on this submanifold is further studied using
renormalization techniques. it is shown that for n = 2, 3, and 4 there
exist special points on the marginal manifold at which the n -cosine
model is equivalent to models of gross-neveu type and therefore is in-
tegrable. in the 2-eld case we further argue that the points mentioned
above exhaust all integrable cases on the marginal submanifold.

introduction

the n -cosine model is a n -eld generalization of the sine-gordon model
(sg). multi-eld generalizations of sg model have been previously intro-
duced by shankar [1], bukhvostov and lipatov [2], fateev [3,4], and recently
by baseilhac et al. [5] and by saleur and simonetti [6]. in particular, the 2-
eld case [2] has drawn closer attention in the subsequent works of ameduri
and efthimiou [7], lesage et al. [8, 9], ameduri et al. [10], and saleur [11].
the boundary double-cosine model has found recent applications in con-
densed matter physics in describing tunneling eects in quantum wires [8,9].
in this work we focus on a model of n boson elds, whose perturbation
to the free lagrangian is a product of n cosines, i. e. the euclidean action

of the model is:

a calculation to rst order in conformal perturbation theory (cpt) [12]
showed that the model (1.1) possesses a conserved current of lorentz spin 3,
when the couplings lie on the submanifold of the parameter space determined
by the constraint

(1.2)

the results of the above analysis are discussed in section 2.

the weakness of the conformal perturbation theory in the limit where
the interaction becomes marginal [12, p.650] requires further investigation
of the integrability of the model on the submanifold (1.2). by performing
renormalization group analysis, conducted using the technique of [13], we
showed that at special points on the marginal manifold the model (1.1) can
be written as a current-current perturbation of the level 1 wess-zumino-
witten (wzw) model based on some lie algebra g. as discussed in [14],
such models are equivalent to the g-invariant gross-neveu models, known
to be integrable [15, 16]. marginal models of the above type have yangian
symmetry and their exact s-matrix can be computed. a similar behavior
in the marginal limit has been observed before by [14] in the sg model
(current-current perturbation of the level 1 su(2) wzw) and in ane toda
theories.

in section 3 we discuss the double-cosine model (n =2 case) in more
details. in addition to the previously known integrable cases in which the
double-cosine model reduces trivially to the marginal sg, we establish the
presence of new integrable points on the marginal manifold where the model
can be written as a current-current perturbation of the level 1 su(3) wzw.
renormalization group arguments then allowed us to further argue that the
aforementioned g-symmetric points exhaust all the integrable cases on the
marginal submanifold.

finally, in section 4, we generalize our analysis to arbitrary n and nd
integrable points for n =3 (current-current perturbation of the level 1 su(4)
wzw) and for n =4 (current-current perturbation of the level 1 so(8) wzw).
some calculational details are given in the appendices.

with this paper we hope to conclude the study of the integrability of the
models involving interactions of the multi-cosine type (1.1) and to place these
qfts in the larger context of known 1+1 dimensional integrable models by
revealing their relationship to the imaginary coupling toda, gross-neveu,
and sine-gordon models.

integral of motion of lorentz spin 3

in this section we investigate the presence of conserved quantities of higher
lorentz spin in the n -cosine model (1.1) using the technique of perturbed
conformal eld theory [12]. by treating a 2d qft as a perturbed cft, it is
possible to study which, if any, of the innite number of conservation laws in
cft survive the perturbation. zamolodchikovs paper [12] also provides us
with an easy way for computing the conserved current densities explicitly.

including all possible local elds of dimension 4 which respect the sym-
metries of the action (1.1), we propose the following ansatz1 for t4 in the
n -eld case:

t4 =

n

xi=1hai(cid:0)2

z i(cid:1)2

+ bi(zi)4i +xi<j

cij(zi)2(zj)2 .

(2.1)

in cft t4 is a holomorphic function and zt4 = 0. in the perturbed
qft that is no longer true and we can compute zt4, using zamolodchikovs
formula [12, eq. (3.14)]:

zt4 = iz

d

2i  n
yi=1

cos[ii(, z)]! t4(z) .

(2.2)

if the rhs of (2.2) can be expressed as a total z-derivative of some local
operator, z2, the conservation law of spin 3 survives in the perturbed
qft and has the form

zt4 = z2 ,

(2.3)

t4 and 2 being the quantum conserved densities of the spin 3 integral of
motion. our goal was to nd all the conditions (if any) on the couplings i,
i = 1, 2, ..., n for which (2.3) holds.

as a result of the calculation one nds that if the form (2.1) is assumed,

the spin 3 current is conserved if and only if

n

xi=1

2
i = 2 ,

for n  3 .

(2.4)

it is interesting to compare the result for n  3 with the (n =2)-case. as
shown in [8] and [10], a quantum conserved current (to rst order in cpt)
exists on 3 distinct submanifolds in (1, 2)-parameter space:

the rst manifold (2.5) is trivial: when 2
2 , the double cosine model
decouples into 2 sine-gordon models and, of course, is integrable both clas-
sically and quantum mechanically. on the second manifold (2.6) the exact
s-matrix has been found by lesage et al. [9], using the method of non-local
charges. the integrability of the model on the third manifold (2.7), to the
best of our knowledge, has not been thoroughly investigated. it is curious
that only the manifold (2.7) generalizes to the case with arbitrary n . our
calculation also showed that for n  3, t4 is not conserved on 2 = 1 and
not even when the squares of all the couplings are equal2.
the fact that t4 is conserved on the manifold (2.4) for arbitrary n is
encouraging. one could hope that it is due to some yet undiscovered sym-
metry of the theory (1.1). the result is, however, challenged by the following
dimensional argument: the quantity 2 (sum of the couplings squared) is ex-
actly the dimension of the perturbing operator in (1.1) and when 2 = 2, this
operator becomes marginal ([] = 0). as a result zamolodchikovs counting
argument [12, p.650] is weak in this case and rst order cpt can no longer
be claimed to give exact results. therefore we need to use other methods to
investigate further the integrability of the model on the marginal manifold.

3 renormalization on the marginal manifold and

integrable points for n = 2

let us consider a conformal eld theory perturbed by some marginal oper-
ators oi(z, z):

s = scft +

1

4 z d2zxi

ioi(z, z) .

(3.1)

zamolodchikov has shown [13] that the beta functions for the couplings i
can be computed by examining the singularities in the operator product
expansions (opes) of the perturbations oi(z, z) and by regularizing them
through introducing a cuto . for an ope of the type

oj(w, w)ok(z, z)  c i

jk oi(z, z)
|w  z|2

(3.2)

the divergence is logarithmic and the beta functions to second order are

i 

di

d log 

=

1
2

c i

jkjk + o3(i) .

(3.3)

2the latter is not as surprising as it may seem because, unlike the (n =2)-case, for
n  3 the lagrangian does not decouple trivially into a sum of sine-gordon lagrangians
even when all the couplings are equal.

4

if the opes of the perturbations in (3.1) do not close on the set {oi(z, z)},
the action (3.1) does not dene a consistent qft. in this case renormaliza-
tion requires that new operators be added to the lagrangian until {oi(z, z)}
becomes closed ope algebra of the type (3.2). we refer to this procedure
by saying that new terms are generated under renormalization.

in the following discussion we shall focus on the particularly interesting

case when the perturbing operator is of current-current type:

s = scft +



4 z d2zo(z, z) ,

o(z, z) =

in case 1 and case 2 the last two terms of (3.7) are regular. in case 1
the couplings 1 and 2 are equal and the model (1.1) decouples into two

6

sine-gordon models5. in case 2 the double-cosine model is non-trivial but
no new terms are brought in by renormalization. in case 3 one of the last
two terms of (3.7) is logarithmically divergent and contributes to the beta
function which is of the type (3.3). this case is the most interesting one and
we will discuss it in some more details. in case 4 the last two terms give rise
to power-law divergences which lead to a generation of a mass term under
renormalization. in case 5 one of the couplings vanishes while the other has

a value of 2. in this case (1.1) is reduced to a single sg model at its

marginal point and a free boson eld. (the marginal limit of the sg model
is discussed in details in [14].)

3.1 the model as a current-current perturbation

in this subsection we will show that the double-cosine interaction can be
written as a current-current perturbation at the marginal points where the
quantity |2
2| has integer values  these are cases 1, 3, and 5 of (3.8).
in each of these cases the values of 1 and 2 are such that the double-cosine
perturbation can be written in the form

1  2

o(z, z) =

yi=1

cos[ii(z, z)] = xj : some

ej (z)ej (z) ,

(3.9)

where {j} are some (but not all) of the roots and ej (z) are the corre-
sponding generators of some lie algebra g in the cartan-weyl basis6. as
we will show below, the generators corresponding to all roots as well as the
cartan generators of g are generated under renormalization, thus leading to
a current-current perturbation to the level 1 g current algebra7:

(3.11)

5see also eq. (2.5) and the discussion that follows.
6in order to write the double-cosine perturbation in terms of the generators ej (z) we

need to use the eld representation of g in terms of bosonic vertex operators:

ej (z) = eij ~(z) ,

j (z) = eij 

~
(z) ,

e

(3.10)

where ~ = (1, . . . , n ) and j is a root of g (by tradition, the vector sign over j is
omitted). for a detailed discussion of the bosonic vertex representation of lie algebras
and the opes of the vertex operators see for instance [17, 18].

let us rst consider case 1 of eq. (3.8). the condition |2

species 4 points in the parameter space:

1  2
1 +2

2| = 0
2 = 2,

2
1 = 2

2 = 1 .

(3.12)

at these points the model decouples into two sg models8, each at its margi-
nal point. as shown for instance in [14], the sg model in the marginal limit
is equivalent under renormalization to a current-current perturbation of the
su(2) current algebra and also to the su(2) gross-neveu model.

next, let us consider case 3 of eq. (3.8). the constraints |2

2 = 2 specify 8 points in the parameter space:

where the values of 1 and 2 are solutions of (3.13), <  min(1, 2), and
< is the eld corresponding to <. consulting the vertex representations
of the kac-moody currents of su(3) and their opes9, we can rewrite the
-term of (3.15) as a current-current perturbation10 of the current algebra
su(3) (the su(3) wzw model).

10see appendix a for details.

this is also equivalent [14] to the su(3) gross-neveu model. therefore, at the
points (3.13) the double-cosine model is integrable and yet nontrivial since
it is not reduced to the sg model.

finally, in case 5 of eq. (3.8), the constraints |2

specify the 4 points

(3.17)

where the model decouples into a free eld and a single marginal sg model
(equivalent under renormalization to a su(2) gross-neveu model [14]).

3.2 the model away from the gross-neveu points

so far we have discussed the behavior of the marginal double-cosine model
only at the special points where the model can be written as a current-current
perturbation. let us now complete the renormalization group analysis on
the entire marginal manifold. the regions that remain to be considered are
described by cases 2 and 4 of eq. (3.8). (see figure 1.)

case 2 corresponds to the regions on the marginal circle, 2

2 = 2,
where the couplings also satisfy the constraint 0 < |2
2| < 1 (the grey
segments on figure 1). on these segments the only contribution to the beta
function of  comes from the rst term of (3.7) while the last two terms
do not give rise to singularities. the full renormalized action in this regime
reads:

(3.19)

although the model in this regime is non-trivial and its properties could
be further investigated, the following simple argument makes integrability
look very unlikely: in the limit |2
2|  0 the model is equivalent to
su(2)  su(2) current-current perturbation (two decoupled sg models) and
its particle spectrum consists of 4 particles 1 soliton and 1 anti-soliton for
each sg model (the fundamental representation of each su(2) is 2). in the
other limit, |2
2|  1, the model is equivalent to a su(3) current-
current perturbation and its spectrum consists of 6 particles  belonging
to the two fundamental representations, 3 and 3, of su(3). therefore it is

1  2

1  2

9

not conceivable, just by counting the degrees of freedom, that the particle
spectrum could be smoothly deformed from the rst point to the second.

1  2

case 4 corresponds to the segments on the marginal circle, where the
couplings also satisfy 1 < |2
2| < 2 (the black segments on figure 1).
on these segments, in addition to the contribution to  coming from the
logarithmic singularity due to the rst term of (3.7), it is necessary to add
new counterterms to the action to cancel the singularity coming from one
of the last two terms of (3.7). this is a power-law singularity and hence,
by dimensional analysis, the coupling of this new counterterm has to be
massive11. the full renormalized action reads:

it can be easily checked that the massive -perturbation in (3.20), gener-
ated under renormalization, breaks the conservation of the spin 3 current
(2.3) even to rst order in cpt. therefore, in this region the model is not
integrable.

4 generalization to arbitrary n

in the previous section we completed our analysis of the integrability of
the double-cosine model (n =2) on the marginal manifold by considering all
distinct cases specied by (3.8). let us now try to generalize our analysis
to the n -eld case. we will be looking in particular for special points on
the marginal n -sphere (2.4) where the n -cosine term can be written as a
current-current perturbation to some current algebra g.

where ~  (1, . . . , n ) and ~  (cid:0)s1

all combinations of signs, si
, are present in the rhs of (4.1), so that there
are 2n dierent vectors ~ in the n -eld case12. our goal is to look for
special values of i for which the vectors  become roots of some lie algebra
g.

 n(cid:1) with si

1, . . . , sn

there are a few constraints on g that can be immediately seen:
1. g must be simply-laced, since (~  ~) = 2,  and thus all the roots

of g must have equal length.

2. rank[g] must be n , since we will be looking for n -eld vertex repre-

sentations of the generators of g.

the simply-laced lie algebras of rank n are an , d(n4), and e(n =6,7,8).
before trying to write (4.1) as a current-current perturbation to one of these
algebras, let us rst make the following simple considerations:

first, since |~|

2

=2, each of its components must satisfy:

(si

2
i)

= 2

i  (0, 2) .

(4.2)

the ends of the above interval, 0 and 2, are excluded because in both cases
some of the couplings i will vanish and the n -eld model will trivially
reduce to a lower-n case. furthermore, if {~} are roots of a simply-laced
lie algebra with squared norm 2, it is easily seen from the cartan matrix
that

(~  ~) = 2 ,
for  =  ;
(~  ~)  {1, 0, +1} , for  6=  .

let us assume, for instance, that ~ and ~ ( 6= ) dier only by their pth
components: sp

n(cid:17),

since for any p  {1, . . . , n}, there is a pair of vectors for which (4.4) is
true, we conclude, using also (2.4), that

in other words, we can only hope to be able to write the n -cosine model as
a current-current perturbation at the points on the marginal manifold whose
coordinates satisfy (4.5). as n increases, (2.4) additionally constrains the
set (4.5), so we nally get:

therefore, for n > 4 the marginal n -cosine model cannot be written as a
current-current perturbation.

let us now consider in some more detail the remaining two cases, n =3
and n =4. we shall discuss below that in both cases there exist specic
sets of values for the couplings i specifying isolated points on the marginal
manifold (2.4) where the model (1.1) is equivalent under renormalization to
a a current-current perturbation of some current algebra g:

(4.10)

this is a model of the gross-neveu type with g-symmetry and such qfts
are known to be integrable. the s-matrices for the g-invariant models of
gross-neveu type are known explicitly for the classical lie algebras [15, 16]
and their structure is expected to be the same for all lie algebras.

in the n = 3 case the only possible candidate for g is a3 = su(4), since
this is the only simply-laced lie algebra of rank 3. there are 24 points
on the marginal manifold (2.4) for which the values of the couplings i are
consistent with (4.7). these points are specied by the equations:

at the above points, the 3-cosine action is equivalent13 to a current-current
perturbation of the type (4.10) with g = su(4).
in this case j runs over
the 3 simple roots and the 3 non-simple positive roots of su(4) and j are
the corresponding negative roots. the perturbation of (4.10) thus contains
the generators for all 12 roots of su(4) and the 3 cartan generators, which is
consistent with rank[su(4)]=3 and dim[su(4)]=15.

for n = 4 the only possible candidates for g are a4 = su(5) and d4 =
so(8), the only simply-laced lie algebras of rank 4. there are 16 points
on the marginal 4-sphere (2.4) for which the values of the couplings i are
consistent with (4.8). their coordinates are xed by the equation:

the vectors ~ for the above values of the couplings do not satisfy the cartan
matrix of su(5) so we are left with the second candidate, so(8). we indeed
showed14 that at the above points the 4-cosine action is equivalent under
renormalization to a current-current perturbation of the g = so(8) current
algebra. j runs over the 4 simple roots and the 8 non-simple positive roots
of so(8) and j are the corresponding negative roots. the perturbation of
(4.10) thus contains the generators for all 24 roots of so(8) and the 4 cartan
generators, which is consistent with rank[so(8)]=4 and dim[so(8)]=28.

5 conclusions

we have completed the analysis of the integrability of the double-cosine
model on the marginal manifold and have found that the model is integrable
only at the points where the interaction can be written as a current-current
perturbation to some current algebra g. in addition to the previously known
points with symmetry su(2) (single sg) and su(2)  su(2) (2 decoupled sgs),
we have also found su(3)-symmetric points where the model is of gross-neveu
type and is thus integrable. similarly, in the n =3 case we observed su(4)-
invariant integrable points and in the n =4 case, so(8)-invariant integrable
points.

at last, we would like to compare the marginal limiting behaviors of the
multi-cosine models and the imaginary coupling ane toda theories [14].
toda theories depend on a single dimensionless coupling parameter. when
this parameter approaches the value for which the perturbing operator be-
comes marginal, the theory is equivalent to a current-current perturbation
of the wzw model based on some lie algebra g. the full current algebra

13some details of the calculation are provided in appendix b.
14some calculational details are provided in appendix c.

in the toda case is generated under renormalization by the vertex operators
in the original action corresponding to the simple roots and the ane root
of g. the multi-cosine models, on the other hand, depend on many coupling
parameters and become marginal on an entire hypersphere in the param-
eter space. at special points on this hypersphere they are also equivalent
to a current-current perturbation of the g-symmetric wzw model, the full
current algebra being generated by vertex operators in the original action
corresponding to the simple and the negative-simple roots of g. therefore,
even though in general the n -cosine models are very dierent from the ane
toda theories, at special marginal points they have the same limiting be-
havior.

the 2-cosine model can be written as a su(3) current-current perturbation at
the 8 points on the marginal 2-sphere (2.4) given by (3.13).

vectors ~ reproduce the simple roots15 of su(3) and their opposite negative

ally used in the literature. since we have to fulll the requirement that i 6= 0, we must
nd such basis of the root space in which all components of all roots are non-vanishing.
all the roots here are written in such basis.

so(8) current-current perturbation for n =4

here we provide some details of our calculation, showing that the 4-cosine
model can be written as a so(8) current-current perturbation at the 16 points
on the marginal 4-sphere (2.4) specied by (4.12).

therefore, the 4-cosine perturbation contains all so(8) generators correspond-
ing to the simple roots 1, 2, 3, 4, and their opposite negative roots, as
well as the generators corresponding to the roots 1+2+3, 1+2+4,
2+3+4, 1+22+3+4, and their opposite. the remaining generators
of so(8), corresponding to the roots 1+2, 2+3, 2+4, 1+2+3+4,
and their opposite, as well as the 4 cartan generators, are generated under
renormalization.
