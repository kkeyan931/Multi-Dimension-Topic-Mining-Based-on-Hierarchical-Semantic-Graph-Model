we review our proposal for a constructive denition of superstring, type iib matrix
model. the iib matrix model is a manifestly covariant model for space-time and matter
which possesses n = 2 supersymmetry in ten dimensions. we rene our arguments to re-
produce string perturbation theory based on the loop equations. we emphasize that the
space-time is dynamically determined from the eigenvalue distributions of the matrices. we
also explain how matter, gauge elds and gravitation appear as uctuations around dynam-
ically determined space-time.

introduction

several proposals have been made as constructive denitions of superstring the-
ory. 1), 5) - 13) the type-iib matrix model, 1) - 3) a large n reduced model of maximally
supersymmetric yang-mills theory, is one of those proposals. it is dened by the fol-
lowing action:

1

g2 tr(cid:18) 1

2

 [a, ](cid:19) ,

(1.1)

where a and  are n  n hermitian matrices, the former is a ten-dimensional
vector and the latter is a ten-dimensional majorana-weyl spinor eld respectively.
it is formulated in a manifestly covariant way, which is suitable for studying nonper-
turbative issues of superstring theory. since it is a simple model of matrices in zero
dimension, it does not possess degenerate vacua unlike its higher dimensional cousins.
it is possible that the model possesses a unique vacuum, namely our space-time. if
so, we can in principle predict the dimensionality of the space-time, low-energy gauge
group and matter contents by solving this model. in such an endeavor, this model

can be studied by numerical simulations eectively. in this paper, we review the iib
matrix model and explain how the space-time appears dynamically and how the low
energy gauge symmetry and dieomorphism invariance emerge microscopically.

we rst list several important properties of the iib matrix model. this model
can be regarded as a large n reduced model of ten-dimensional n = 1 supersym-
it was shown 14) that a large n gauge theory
metric su (n ) yang-mills theory.
can be equivalently described by its reduced model, namely a model dened on a
single point. in this reduction procedure, a space-time translation is represented in
the color su (n ) space, and the eigenvalues of the matrices are interpreted as the
momenta of elds. therefore, the basic assumption in this identication is that the
eigenvalues are uniformly distributed. as a constructive denition of a superstring,
on the other hand, we will see that we need to interpret the eigenvalues of matrices
as the coordinates of space-time points. the interpretation is t-dual to the above.
since our iib matrix model is dened on a single point, the commutator of the
supersymmetry which we inherit from the ten-dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric
su (n ) yang-mills theory,

( (1)a = i 1

(1)

= i

2   [a, a]1,

(1.2)

vanishes up to a eld-dependent gauge transformation, and we can no longer interpret
this supersymmetry as space-time supersymmetry in the original sense. however,
after the reduction, we acquire an extra bosonic symmetry,

a = c1,

(1.3)

whose transformation is proportional to the unit matrix 1 and an extra supersym-
metry,

(cid:26) (2)a = 0

(2)

= 2.

the linear combinations of these two supersymmetries (1.2) and (1.4),

q(1) = q(1) + q(2), q(2) = i(q(1)  q(2)),

satisfy the following commutation relations,

q(i), 2

[ 1

q(j)] = 2 12p(ij),

(1.4)

(1.5)

(1.6)

where p is the generator of the translation (1.3) and i, j = 1, 2. therefore, if we
interpret the eigenvalues of the matrices a as our space-time coordinates, the above
symmetries can be regarded as ten-dimensional n = 2 space-time supersymmetry.
since the maximal space-time supersymmetry guarantees the existence of gravitons
if the theory permits the massles spectrum, it supports our conjecture that the iib
matrix model is a constructive denition of superstring. this is one of the major
reasons to interpret the eigenvalues of a as being the coordinates of the space-time
which has emerged out of the matrices.

the second important and confusing property is that the model has the same
action as the low-energy eective action of d-instantons. 15) we should emphasize
here the dierences between these two theories, since we are led to dierent inter-
pretations of space-time. from an eective-theory point of view, the eigenvalues
represent the coordinates of d-instantons in ten-dimensional bulk space-time, which
we have assumed a priori from the beginning of constructing the eective action.
on the other hand, from a constructive point of view, we cannot assume such a
bulk space-time, in which matrices live. this is because not only elds, but also
the space-time, should be dynamically generated as a result of the dynamics of the
matrices. the space-time should be constructed only from the matrices. the most
natural interpretation is that space-time consists of n discretized points, and that
the eigenvalues represent their space-time coordinates. here we need to assume that
the dynamics of the iib matrix model is such that the resulting eigenvalue distribu-
tions are smooth enough to be interpreted as riemannian geometry.

a nal important property is that the type-iib matrix model has no free pa-

rameters. the coupling constant g can always be absorbed by eld redenitions:

(cid:26) a  g1/2a
  g3/4.

(1.7)

this is reminiscent of string theory where a shift of the string coupling constant
is always absorbed to that of the dilaton vacuum expectation value (vev).
in an
analysis of the schwinger-dyson equation of the iib matrix model, 2) we introduced
an infrared cut-o , which gives a string coupling constant, gst = 1/n 2. how-
ever, through a more careful analysis of the dynamics of the eigenvalues, 3) we have
shown that there is no such infrared divergences associated with innitely separated
eigenvalues, and that the infrared cuto  which we have introduced by hand can be
determined dynamically in terms of n and g. (the schwinger-dyson equation and
the double scaling limit are discussed in 2.)
we then explain several reasons we believe that the iib matrix model is a con-
structive denition of type-iib superstring in addition to the symmetry argument.
first, this action can be related to the green-schwarz action of a superstring 16) by
using the semiclassical correspondence in the large n limit:

in fact, eq. (1.1) is related to the green-schwarz action in the schild gauge: 17)

sschild = z d2(cid:20)pg(cid:18) 1

4{x , x }2 

i
2

 {x , }(cid:19) + pg(cid:21) .

we need to integrate over the scale factor of the metric g in order to quantize the
schild action

z = z dgdxdesschild.

(1.8)

(1.9)

the matrix analog is the following grand canonical ensemble:

xn=0z dades(),
tr[a, a ]2 

1
4

s() = (cid:18)

2

tr(  [a, ])(cid:19) + tr1.

(1.11)

if the large n limit is smooth, we expect that the   c limit is identical to
consider the microcanonical ensemble with xed n and take n large.
the correspondence can go farther beyond the above identication of the model
with a matrix regularization of the rst quantized superstring. namely, we can
describe an arbitrary number of interacting d-strings and anti-d-strings as blocks
of matrices, each of which corresponds to the matrix regularization of a string. o-
diagonal blocks induce interactions between these strings. 1), 19) thus, it must be clear
that the iib matrix model is denitely not the rst quantized theory of a d-string,
but a full second quantized theory.

it has also been shown 2) that wilson loops satisfy the string eld equations of
motion for type-iib superstring in the light-cone gauge, which is a second evidence for
the conjecture that the iib matrix model is a constructive denition of superstring.
we consider the following regularized wilson loop: 2), 20)

w(c) = tr" m
yn=1

exp{i(k

na + n)}# .

(1.12)

here, k
n are the momentum densities distributed along a loop c; we have also
introduced fermionic sources, n. the symbol  is a short-distance cuto of string
world sheet. in the large n limit,  should go to 0 so as to satisfy the double scaling
limit. in ref. 2) it was proved, once we have taken the correct scaling limit, that
the n = 2 supersymmetry is enough to reproduce the lightcone eld equation of
type iib superstring from the iib matrix model. in order to resolve the problem of
the double scaling limit, we need to evaluate several quantities (i.e., an expectation
value of the wilson loop with almost zero total momentum) and there is still some
subtlety as to how to take this double scaling limit in which we obtain an interacting
string theory. it is discussed extensively in 2.
considered as a matrix regularization of the green-schwarz iib superstring,
the iib matrix model describes interacting d-strings. on the other hand, in an
analysis of the wilson loops, the iib matrix model describes joining and splitting
interactions of fundamental iib superstrings created by the wilson loops. from
these considerations, it is plausible to conclude that if we can take the correct double
scaling limit, the iib matrix model could become a constructive denition of type-
iib superstring. furthermore, we believe that all string theories are connected by
duality transformations, and once we construct a nonperturbative denition of any
one of them, we can describe the vacua of any other strings, particularly the true
vacuum in which we live.

the dynamics of eigenvalues, that is, dynamical generation of space-time was
rst discussed in ref. 3). an eective action of eigenvalues can be obtained by

iib matrix model

5

integrating all of the o-diagonal bosonic and fermionic components, and then the
diagonal fermionic coordinates (which we call fermion zeromodes). if we quench the
bosonic diagonal components, xi
 (i = 1 n ), and neglect the fermion zeromodes
i, the eective action for xi
 coincides with that of supersymmetric yang-mills
theory with maximal supersymmetry and vanishes respecting the stability of the
supersymmetric moduli. the inclusion of fermion zeromodes as well as the non-
planar contributions lifts the degeneracy, and we can obtain a nontrivial eective
action for the space-time dynamics. in ref. 3) we estimated this eective action
by perturbation at one loop, which is valid when all eigenvalues are far from one

another, |xi  xj|  g. of course, this one-loop eective action is not sucient to

determine the full space-time structure, but we expect that it captures some of the
essential points concerning the formation of space-time. one of important properties
of the eective action is that, as a result of grassmannian integration of the fermion
zeromodes, space-time points make a network connected locally by bond interactions.
this feature becomes important when we extract dieomorphism symmetry from our
matrix model, which is discussed in 4.
once we are convinced that iib matrix model is a constructive denition of su-
perstring, we then have to give natural interpretation of low energy dynamics. that
is, we need to show how we can obtain local eld theory in a low energy approxima-
tion and the origin of local gauge symmetry in our space-time generated dynamically
from matrices. we also have to show how the background metric is encoded in a low
energy eld theory in the space-time, especially the origin of dieomorphism invari-
ance. in ref. 4) we have shown that, if we suppose that the eigenvalue distribution
consists of small clusters of size n, the low-energy theory acquires su (n) local space-
time gauge symmetry. this gauge invariance assures the existence of a gauge eld
propagating in the space-time of distributed eigenvalues. also, we have obtained
a low energy eective action (a gauge-invariant kinetic action) for a fermion in the
adjoint representation of su (n), which becomes massless. the low-energy behavior
for these elds is formulated as a lattice gauge theory on a dynamically generated
random lattice, and hence supports our interpretation of space-time. we have also
shown in ref. 4) that the dieomorphism invariance of our model originates in in-
variance under permutations of the eigenvalues. our model realizes the invariance in
an interesting way by summing all possible graphs connecting the space-time points.
the dieomorphism invariance restricts the low-energy behavior of the model, and
indicates the existence of a massless graviton in the low energy eective eld theory
on dynamically generated space-time. the background metric for propagating elds
is shown to be encoded in the density correlation of the eigenvalues, while the dilaton
vacuum expectation value is encoded in the eigenvalue density. a curved background
can be described as a nontrivial distribution of eigenvalues whose density correlation
behaves inhomogeneously.

both of these fundamental symmetries, local gauge symmetry and the dieo-
morphism symmetry, originates in the su (n ) invariance of the matrix model. it
is quite interesting that these fundamental symmetries can arise from a very simple
matrix model dened on a single point. these are discussed in 4.

the organization of this paper is as follows. in 2, we review our analysis of
the schwinger-dyson equation for the wilson loops and discuss a problem on the
double scaling limit. in 3, we briey review our analysis on the dynamics of space-
time, and show how a network picture of space-time arises. here is an analogy with
the dynamical triangulation approach to quantum gravity. we also discuss a recent
result on numerical simulation. in 4, we discuss a possible origin of low energy gauge
symmetry on a dynamically generated space-time and that of the dieomorphism
invariance. we also show that we can obtain a low energy eective action for several
elds by using these low energy symmetries. such low-energy eective theories are
formulated as a lattice gauge theory on a dynamically generated random lattice.
section 5 is devoted to discussions.

2. loop equations and scaling limit

in this section, we derive the light-cone string eld theory of type iib super-
string 18) from the schwinger-dyson equations for the wilson loops (loop equations).
the purpose of this analysis is to verify that the iib matrix model indeed reproduces
the standard perturbation series of type iib superstring and to x how to take the
scaling limit. here we review the analysis in ref. 2) with renement.

we regard the wilson loop

w(c) = tr(v(c)),

v(c) = p exp(cid:18)iz 2

0

d(k()a + ())(cid:19) ,

(2.1)

as the creation or annihilation operator for the momentum representation eigenstate
of string |k, ()i, where k() is a momentum density on the worldsheet and ()
is its super-partner. we explain in 2.1 the reason why this interpretation is natural.

the basic equations we consider in the following are the loop equations:

0 = z dad
0 = z dad



 {tr(tv(c1))w(c2) w(cl)es},

a


{tr(tv(c1))w(c2) w(cl)es},

(2.2)

(2.3)

where t is a generator of u (n ) lie algebra, and an equation which represents the
local reparametrization invariance of the loop:

 k()(cid:18)



k()(cid:19)

+ ()(cid:18) 

()(cid:19)! w(c) = 0.

(2.4)

2.1. wilson loops and light-cone setting

in this subsection, we briey sketch our basic idea for deriving the light-cone
string eld theory from the loop equations. for this purpose, let us consider only the
bosonic parts. we emphasize here that we perform this simplication for explanation.
in fact, as is explained later, we cannot obtain the light-cone string eld theory from
the bosonic reduced model.

iib matrix model

7

we rst explain a motivation to consider the wilson loops like eq. (2.1) in the
following. let us consider a gauge theory in a box with size a. we impose the
periodic boundary conditions on the elds. then a wilson (polyakov) loop is given
by

where x is an arbitrary function which satises the condition

w(c) = tr(cid:18)p eir 2

0

dx

()a(x())(cid:19) ,

x(2)  x(0) = na.

(2.5)

(2.6)

here the n are the winding numbers in the -th directions. in the zero volume limit
(a  0), eq. (2.5) reduces to

w(c) = tr(cid:18)p eir 2

0

dx

()a(cid:19) .

(2.7)

the expectation values of the wilson loops with nontrivial windings vanish if the
translation (u (1)) symmetry is not spontaneously broken. this phase transition
is known to be the deconning transition in lattice gauge theory. this symmetry
may be broken in the large n limit for bosonic reduced models. in order to obtain
string theory in minkowski space which is translation invariant, we have to keep
the translation invariance by supersymmetrizing the theory. we assume that the
gauge theory is in the conning phase and hence well described by string theory. we
further assume that there is no phase transition while we take a  0 limit. then the
wilson loop (2.7) must represent strings. let us consider the wilson loops with large
winding numbers so that na is nite in a  0 limit. they represent the strings
with no momentum but with many windings in the zero volume target space. in
order to obtain the strings moving in the innite-volume target space, we adopt the
t-dual picture here. that is, we reinterpret x as the momentum density, k, and
obtain the (bosonic part of) expression (2.1). as is expected in the ordinary t-dual
picture, the windings are converted to the total momenta, which is seen readily in
the relation

na = z 2

0

dk().

(2.8)

thus we regard the wilson loop (2.1) as the creation and annihilation operator for
the momentum representation eigenstate of string |k(), ()i. since a is dual
to the momentum in the expression (2.1), it can be interpreted as the space-time
coordinate naturally.

to make the connection with the light-cone string eld theory, we consider the
particular congurations of the wilson loops, which we call the light-cone setting.
the schwinger-dyson equations lead to the continuum loop equation as we explain
shortly:

(k(b)()2 + x(b)()2)hw(c1) w(cb) w(cl)i = 0,
where for simplicity we consider only the free part and we denote i
we have also the local reparametrization invariance (the bosonic part of (2.4)),

k() as x().

(2.9)



x(b)()k(b)

 ()hw(c1) w(cb) w(cl)i = 0.

(2.10)

8

h. aoki, s. iso, h. kawai, y. kitazawa, a. tsuchiya and t. tada

we put k(b)+() = 1 for all the wison loops by using the reparametrization in-
variance so that we set the length of the strings to be equal to the + components
of their total momenta. we consider the congurations of the wilson loops which
possess the identical light-cone time x+. namely we perform the functional fourier
transformations of the wilson loop from k(b)() to x(b)+() and consider such con-
gurations that x(b)+() = x+ for all the wilson loops. we also locate a group of
the wilson loops at x+ =  which represent a particular initial state. after these
prescriptions, we denote the wilson loop by w(c):

w(c) = w[x+() = x+, k+() = 1, ki();  = 0  p+]

= z dk()eir p+

0

dx+()k()w(c)|k+()=1,x+()=x+ ,

(2.11)

where p+ is the + component of the total momentum. this is the light-cone setting
which is illustrated in fig. 1.

in the light-cone setting, the loop equation (2.9) reduces to

k(b)()h w(c1) w(cb) w(cl)i

x(b)+()h w(c1) w(cb) w(cl)i

fig. 1. the light-cone setting. we consider the congurations of the wilson loops which possess
the identical light-cone time x+. we also locate a group of the wilson loops at x+ =  which
represent a particular initial state. we put k+() = 1 for all the wison loops by using the
reparametrization invariance.

equation (2.10) reduces to

h w(c1) w(cb) w(cl)i
= x(b)i()k(b)i()h w(c1) w(cb) w(cl)i.

(2.13)

using these equations we can deform the wilson loop locally from the constant x+
surface and shift the value of k(b)+() locally. therefore we can recover general
congurations of the wilson loops. this fact ensures us to consider the light-cone
setting. integrating eq. (2.12) over  and summing up over b, we obtain an operator
which shift the constant value of x+, that is, the light-cone hamiltonian:

i


x+h w(c1) w(cb) w(cl)i

= xb z d

2

(k(b)i()2 + x(b)i()2)h w(c1) w(cb) w(cl)i,

(2.14)

which is identical to the free light-cone hamiltonian of bosonic string. note that we
can obtain a closed system of equations within the light-cone setting even though we
consider the particular congurations of the wilson loops. our procedure is anal-
ogous to obtaining a hamiltonian in super-many-time theory, where a hamiltonian
density is dened on a general space-like surface. we consider a constant time surface
and integrate a hamiltonian density on it to obtain an ordinary hamiltonian.

2.2. loop equations and loop space

in this subsection, we represent our loop equations by the loop space variables

and put them in the light-cone setting.

though the right-hand side of eq. (2.18) vanishes in naive   0 limit, we expect
here that for nite n an ultraviolet cut-o  appears naturally on the worldsheet.
we assume that  converges to zero in n   limit such as   n b (b > 0). we
should keep  and other quantities depending on n in the process of the calculation
and take n   (  0) limit as the continuum limit in the nal stage.
we expect naively that we may ignore the terms except the rst one in the
right-hand sides of eq. (2.18) since they are the higher order terms with respect to .
however, in general, they contribute to the renormalization of the lower-dimensional
terms because in the loop equations they generate the divergences from operator
product expansion. the ways we represent the loop equations are not unique since
the right-hand sides of eq. (2.18) can be expressed in innitely many ways. however
we expect that they are unique in the   0 limit in the loop equation. this is the
universality of the dierential operators, which is guaranteed by a power counting
and symmetry as seen in 2.4. here we may draw an analogy with the quantum eld
theory on the lattice. the lattice action may be expanded formally in terms of the
lattice spacing a. although the operators which are suppressed by the powers of a
formally vanish in the continuum, we cannot simply neglect them because they may
renormalize the relevant operators. in fact we can write down many lattice actions
which possess the identical continuum limit.

here let us proceed to the light-cone setting. the + component of total momen-
tum carried by the w[x+() = x+, k+() = 1, ki(), ();  = 0  )] is equal to
. therefore we expect naively

h w[x+() = x+, k+() = 1, ki(), ();  = 0  )]i = 0

(2.21)

because of the momentum conservation if  6= 0. we also expect the same case for
h w[x+() = x+, k+() = 1, ki(), ();  = p+    p+]i. however these are not
actually the cases since the eigenvalues of a distribute in a nite range for nite
n , which violates the momentum conservation slightly. therefore these two w have

12

support for small  generally. we dene a nonvanishing quantity i by

i = z p+

0

dh w[x+() = x+, k+() = 1, ki(), ();  = 0  ]

+ w[x+() = x+, k+() = 1, ki(), ();  = p+    p+]i. (2.22)

we expect that i diverges as n   and assume that its large n behavior is
i  n a (a > 0). then a part of the splitting interaction term in the loop equa-
tions contribute to the rst term in the loop equations representing the innitesimal
deformation of the string.

thus in the light-cone setting eq. (2.19) leads to

we eliminate a half of fermionic degrees of freedom by using the above two equations
just like eliminating the half of the fermionic degrees of freedom in the light-cone
eld theory by using the equation of motion. we can also rewrite eq. (2.4) as

(2.28)

our task is summarized as follows. by using eqs. (2.23), (2.26), (2.27) and
, and evaluate the

(2.28) iteratively and repeatedly, we eliminate n a, n a and x
light-cone hamiltonian,

h = xb z dk(b)().

(2.29)

in this process, various interaction terms of order 1/i k  o(1/n ka) are generated,
which represent processes where the k + 2 strings interact at one point, i.e., (k + 2)-
reggeon vertices. in this procedure, we should take the continuum limit by keeping
the higher order terms of  vanishing in the naive   0 limit. this task is in general
very hard to perform because we should treat innite series. however we will discuss

14

h. aoki, s. iso, h. kawai, y. kitazawa, a. tsuchiya and t. tada

in 2.4 that the continuum limit is completely controllable by an analysis based on a
power counting of  and the symmetries. we should consider the supercharges rst
rather than the hamiltonian in this more rigorous treatment. in the next subsection,
we rst sketch how we can derive light-cone hamiltonian for type iib superstring
from the loop equations.

2.3. light-cone hamiltonian

  

here we neglect the interaction terms in eq. (2.23) and concentrate on the free
part of light-cone hamiltonian. we can see that if we ignore the non-quadratic terms
and set g2i
2  const, the free part of eq. (2.23) has the same form as the free
light-cone hamiltonian of type iib superstring in the naive continuum limit except
lacking the 
aa term. in the following, we verify that we indeed obtain this term
when we eliminate  a in the free part of eq. (2.23) using eq. (2.27). let us consider
the naive leading contribution in the free part of eq. (2.27):

g2i


a ()hw(c 1)w(c 2) w(c l)i. (2.30)
(1)

we assume rst that the free part of eq. (2.23) correctly describes the free part of
light-cone hamiltonian. this assumption can be justied by showing that the non-
quadratic terms are indeed negligible in the continuum limit except for nite renor-
malization of the quadratic terms. since we are dealing with free two-dimensional
eld theories, we can use standard techniques of conformal eld theory to estimate
()2 is of order 1/2
the eects of the non-quadratic terms. we note that the x

since we have a cuto length . so we may expand x

where : y : denotes the normal ordered operator constructed out of y. the symbol

 in the denominator is a quantity proportional to p/g2i on dimensional grounds.

in this way, the left-hand side of eq. (2.30) becomes

in this way, we see that non-quadratic higher-dimensional operators do not ap-
pear in the continuum limit due to the suppression of the powers of  and only
renormalize nitely the quadratic operators. therefore we expect to obtain the fol-
lowing free hamiltonian in the continuum limit:

here we assume that terms with the negative powers of  and other nite terms
such as kixi do not remain, which is guaranteed by an argument based on a power
counting and symmetries as is seen in the next subsection. in the bosonic model,
this is not guaranteed and the 1/2 divergence remains in general. this is the reason
why we cannot obtain the light-cone string eld theory from the bosonic reduced
model. the hamiltonian (2.33) is identical to that of type iib superstring theory 18)
if a() and a() are rescaled appropriately and rotated by a complex phase factor
 = exp( i

4 ) as follows:

a()  a(), a()  a().

(2.34)

we elaborate more on this point in connection with the supercharges in the next
subsection. here we cannot determine the coecients c, c, c and c, which include
the eects of renormalizations, and in the next subsection we can x them by using
n =2 supersymmetry. from eq. (2.33) we nd 2  g2i/ and hence we should
obtain the prescription of the scaling limit, g2n a+b  2  const.
2.4. general proof

in this subsection, we give a general proof of our assertion that the light-cone
string eld theory for type iib superstring can be derived from the loop equations
of the iib matrix model. we use a power counting and a symmetry analysis based
on n =2 supersymmetry, so(8) invariance and the parity symmetry on the string
worldsheet.

2.4.1. power counting and parity symmetry

in order to perform a power counting for , we rst introduce a mass dimension
on the worldsheet through the relation [] = 1 and determine the dimension of each
eld. the iib matrix model action (1.1) is decomposed into

[a+, a]2  [a+, ai][a, ai] +

[ai, aj ]2

s =

2

g2 tr  
(2a[a+, a]  ai

1
2

a a[ai,  a]   ai

aa[ai, a] + 2 a[a,  a])!.

by demanding the iib matrix model action (2.35) to be dimensionless, we obtain

[ai] = 0, [a+] = [a], [a+] = 2[a] and [a] = 2[ a].

(2.36)

on the other hand, the wilson loop (2.1) is decomposed into

(2.35)

w(c) = tr(cid:16)p exp(cid:16)iz p+

0

d(k+()a

from this, we also read o the relations

k()a+ + ki()ai  ia()a  i a() a(cid:17)(cid:17).

(2.37)

[k+] + [a] = 1,

16

h. aoki, s. iso, h. kawai, y. kitazawa, a. tsuchiya and t. tada

[k] + [a+] = 1,
[ki] + [ai] = 1,
[a] + [a] = 1,
[ a] + [ a] = 1.

(2.38)

noting that we should set [k+] to be zero since k+() = 1 in our light-cone setting,
we can determine the dimensions of all quantities as follows:

[k+] = 0, [k] = 2, [ki] = 1, [a] =

1
2
1
[x+] = 1, [x] = 1, [xi] = 0, [a] =

[a+] = 1, [a] = 1, [ai] = 0, [a] =

,

2

, [ a] =

, [ a] =

, [ a] =

,

.

(2.39)

next we dene a symmetry which corresponds to the parity on the string world-
sheet. it is seen easily that the iib matrix model action (1.1) is formally invariant
under the following transformation:

this transformation ips the direction of the wilson loop in the following way:

a  at
,
  it.

(2.40)

w(c) = tr p eir p+

0

d(k()a+())!
 tr p
eir p+

yn=1

m

0

d(k(p+)ai(p+))! . (2.41)

therefore our theory has a symmetry under the transformation

k()  k(p+  ),
()  i(p+  ),

(2.42)

which we identify with the worldsheet parity. we also obtain the parity transforma-
tion for the dual variables x

n and n:

x()  x(p+  ),
()  i(p+  ).

2.4.2. n =2 supersymmetry

we denote the supercharges generating the transformations

by q(1) and q(2) respectively. we can determine the dimensions and parities of the
parameters  and  in eqs. (2.44) and (2.45) by comparing their both sides,

(2.46)

(2.49)

2.4.3. free parts of supercharges and hamiltonian

the supercharges q(1) and q(2) can be expressed as dierential operators on the
loop space using the ward identities. in principle we can eliminate the operators
,  a and  a by repeatedly using the loop equations and the reparametrization
k, x
invariance as is discussed for k in the previous section. note that we obtain inter-
action terms through this procedure. however as we will see just below, the forms
of their continuum limit are completely determined by the dimension, parity and
so(8) invariance. first we concentrate on free parts of the supercharges q(1) and
q(2), i.e., ignore the interaction terms. by using the power counting, eqs. (2.39) and
(2.47), so(8) invariance and the parity symmetry, eqs. (2.42), (2.43) and (2.48),
we can deduce the following forms of free supercharges in the   0 limit:

q(1)

q(2)

free a = z da1a(),
free a = z da2a(),
free a = z d(b1xi()i
free a = z d(b2ki()i

(2.50)

18

h. aoki, s. iso, h. kawai, y. kitazawa, a. tsuchiya and t. tada

in eq. (2.50) we have excluded terms such as 1
 xii by translation invariance. it
is easy to see that all possible terms which appear with negative powers of  are
forbidden by the symmetries.
in this sense the existence of the continuum limit
is guaranteed by the symmetries. we can also x undetermined coecients in eq.

(2.50) by the n =2 supersymmetry (2.49) as follows. from {q(1)
{q(1)

which completely agree with the light-cone green-schwarz free hamiltonian and su-
percharges for type iib superstring. this fact also justies the analytic continuation
introduced for fermionic elds in ref. 1). we also note that we have obtained the re-
lation b1c2  1/2, and b1c2 should be equal to /g2i multiplied by some numerical
constant as is illustrated in the previous subsection.

2.4.4.

interaction parts of supercharges and hamiltonian

in this subsection, we examine the structure of the interaction parts of the super-
charges and the hamiltonian. first we consider the contributions of order 1/i, which
correspond to 3-reggeon vertices in string eld theory. since our free hamiltonian
is equal to that of the green-schwarz light-cone formalism and the interactions of
loops are local in our loop equations, we can use the same arguments as in light-cone
string eld theory.
in general, the operators inserted near the interaction points
in 3-reggeon vertices generate divergences coming from the mandelstam mapping.
since our wilson loops are written by the variables ki and , the corresponding 3-
reggeon vertices should consist of delta functions representing the matching of three
strings in the k   space, which is the same as in ref. 18). therefore the ki, xi
and a diverge as 1/ near the interaction points while a is of order 0 there. we
also note that every derivative of  acting on the elds introduces an extra factor of
1/. therefore the interaction part at order 1/i of the supercharges possesses the
following general structure:

1

i z dz d1(ki)(xi)(a)(a)

(derivative)(products of delta functions for ki and a),

(2.57)

where ki, xi, a and a represent the operators inserted near the interaction points,
and  is the total number of derivatives acting on these operators.

for example, let us consider the interaction part of q(1)
a .
2  + 1
free a] leads to  +  +  + 1

in this case, the
dimensional analysis [q(1)
2  +   1 = 1
2 ,
where we used the relation [i] = 1 and the fact that the dimensions of the delta
functions are canceled due to supersymmetry. therefore the total powers of  which
appear in the interaction part of q(1)
a

int a] = [q(1)

is evaluated as

(2.58)

the case in which  =  =  =  = 0 is excluded by so(8) invariance. we can
consider four cases in which  = 1: (1) = 1 and  =  =  = 0, (2) = 1 and
 =  =  = 0, (3) = 1 and  =  =  = 0 and (4) = 1 and  =  =  = 0. cases
(3) and (4) are not permitted by so(8) invariance. if we take the large-n limit with
i kept xed, cases (1) and (2) survive in the   0 limit. this limit corresponds to
taking gst  1/i. note that in this limit all of the other cases vanish because  is
larger than 1 for them. furthermore we can restrict the values of  by the parity

20

h. aoki, s. iso, h. kawai, y. kitazawa, a. tsuchiya and t. tada

symmetry and deduce the structure of q(1)

int a as follows:

q(1)

int a =

1

i z dz d1(ki((a)3 + (a)7) + xi(a + (a)5))

(products of delta functions for ki and a).

(2.59)

this structure agrees with that of the light-cone string eld theory. 18) applying a
similar analysis to q(2)

int a, we obtain

q(2)

int a =

1

i z dz d(ki(a + (a)5) + xi((a)3 + (a)7))

(products of delta functions for ki and a),

(2.60)

and q(2)

int a and q(2)

which also agrees with the light-cone string eld theory. as for q(1)
a , no
a
1/i contribution remains non-zero in this limit since the minimum value of  is  1
2
in these cases. therefore we conclude that q(1)
int a are equal to zero at
order 1/i, which is again consistent with the light-cone string eld theory. note
that the right-hand sides of eqs. (2.59) and (2.60) are uniquely determined by n =2
supersymmetry, as is shown in ref. 18). finally the anti-commutation relation
{q(1)
b } = 2h ab xes the interaction part of h, which is certainly consistent
next we consider the contributions of order 1/i k (k  2), which correspond to
(k + 2)-reggeon vertices. the general structure of the interaction part is represented
as

with the light-cone string eld theory.

a , q(2)

1

i k z dz d1    dk(ki)(xi)(a)(a)(derivative)

(products of delta functions for ki and a).

(2.61)

from the mandelstam mapping in these cases, it is natural to consider that the ki,
xi and a diverge as  k
k+1 near the interaction points. therefore the total power 
of  is evaluated as

int a in the   0 limit, which
is consistent with the light-cone string eld theory. using so(8) invariance, we can
show that in q(1)
int a some terms with  equal to ve might survive for k = 2
and ones with  equal to seven for k = 2 and k = 3. presumably it is not possible
to satisfy n =2 supersymmetry only by these restricted terms. therefore we may
conclude that there are no contributions of order 1/i k (k  2) in q(1)
int a and

the hamiltonian, which is also consistent with the light-cone string eld theory.

3. dynamics of eigenvalues and space-time generation

in this section we analyze the structure of space-time, and in particular, try
to explain why our space-time is four-dimensional. 3) as we mentioned in the in-
troduction, the diagonal elements of the bosonic matrices a can be interpreted as
space-time itself. for example, if the diagonal elements distribute within a manifold
which extends in four dimensions but shrinks in six dimensions, then a natural in-
terpretation is that the space-time is four-dimensional. we thus derive an eective
theory for the diagonal elements, and analyze their distribution.

we decompose a into diagonal part x and o-diagonal part a. we also

decompose  into diagonal part  and o-diagonal part :

a = x + a; x =

here the products are taken over all possible dierent pairs (ij) of the space-time

factors, 1, tr(s4
the last two factors are functions of (xi

that connect the space-time points xi
. since the factors tr(s4
(ij))/4 and
(tr(s8

them an 8-fold bond and a 16-fold bond, respectively. we do not assign any bond
to the factor 1. in this way we can associate each term in the expansion of multi-
products in eq. (3.10) with a graph connecting the space-time points by 8-fold bonds
and 16-fold bonds. therefore the multi-products in eq. (3.10) can be replaced by a
summation over all possible graphs:

here we sum over all possible graphs consisting of 8-fold and 16-fold bonds. for each
bond (ij) of g, we assign the rst or the second factor depending on whether it is
an 8-fold or a 16-fold bond.

24

in order to saturate the grassmann integration d, we need 16(n  1) fermion
zeromodes. since an 8-fold bond and a 16-fold bond contain 8 and 16 fermion
zeromodes respectively, graphs remaining after the  integrations are those where
the sum of the number of 8-fold bonds and twice the number of 16-fold bonds is
equal to 2(n  1). thus, the number of bonds is of order n , which is much smaller
than possible number of pairs n (n  1)/2. in this sense n space-time points are
weakly bound.
since 8-fold bond and 16-fold bond terms behave as (xij)12 and (xij)24, both
are strong attractive interactions. hence, only the closer points can be connected
by the bonds, and these interactions become local. on the other hand, since all
possible graphs must be summed up, this system has a permutation invariance among
the points. this reminds us of summation over all triangulations in the dynamical
triangulation approach to quantum gravity. we come back to this analogy in 4.
in order to see some important features of the system (3.11), let us take an
approximation. if there were only 16-fold bonds, considerable simplications take
place and the  integrations can be performed exactly. since a 16-fold bond term
contains 16 fermion zeromodes, it is proportional to delta function of the grassmann
variables as

(3.12)

tr(s8

(ij))  (16)(i  j)

1

(xi  xj)24 .

if there is a loop in the graph, the contribution vanishes, since the product of delta
functions of grassmann variables on the loop vanishes:

(16)(i1i2)(16)(i2i3) (16)(iki1) = 0.

(3.13)

also, as we mentioned above, the remaining graphs have (n  1) number of 16-fold
bonds. hence, the remaining graphs are tree graphs which connect all n points.
such type of graphs are called maximal trees. we also note that all maximal trees
contribute equally as we can see by performing  integrations from the end points
of each maximal tree. therefore, only with 16-fold bonds, the distribution of xi

becomes branched polymer type:

z dxes16-fold bond

e

[x] = z dx xg:maximal graph

y(ij):bond of g

1

(xi  xj)24 .

(3.14)

note that all points are connected by the bonds, and each xij integration can
be performed independently and converges for large xij on each bond. thus this
system is infrared convergent. as we proved rigorously in ref. 3), this feature of ir
convergence holds even with 8-fold bonds, and also, to all orders in perturbation ex-
pansion. this is consistent with the explicit calculations of the partition function. 23)
this shows that all points are gathered as a single bunch and hence space-time is in-
separable. thus, the size and the dimensionality of the space-time can be determined
dynamically. note also that the dynamics of branched polymer is well known and
its hausdor dimension is four. it is conceivable that the smooth four-dimensional
space-time emerges by taking account of the eects from 8-fold bonds as we argue
in what follows. therefore, the model (3.11) constitutes a candidate of models for
dynamical generation of four-dimensional space-time.

iib matrix model

25

before going into the analysis of the space-time structures by using the eective
action (3.11), which is valid in the long distance, we consider the short distance
behavior of the system. let us suppose that a pair of the bosonic coordinates are
degenerate but the rest of the coordinates are well separated from one another and
from the center of mass coordinates of the pair. we can determine the dynamics
of the relative coordinates of the pair of the points, from the exact solution for the
su (2) case. the distribution for the relative coordinates r is

z d10rf (r),
f (r)  ( 1/r24

r8

r2  g
r2  g

.

(3.15)

we conclude that there is a pairwise repulsive potential of 8 ln r type when two
coordinates are close to each other. it is clear that these considerations are valid
for arbitrary numbers of degenerate pairs although the center of mass coordinates
should be well separated. although it is possible to repeat these considerations to
the cases with higher degeneracy, the analysis becomes more complicated. therefore
we choose to adopt a phenomenological approach and assume the existence of the
hardcore repulsive potential of the following form:

score[x] = xi<j

g(xi  xj),

where

g(xi  xj) = ( 4 ln((xi  xj)2/g)

0

for (xi  xj)2  g
for (xi  xj)2  g

.

(3.16)

(3.17)

hereafter, we investigate the structure of space-time by using the one loop eective
action (3.11) plus the phenomenological hardcore potential (3.16).

if the number of 16-fold bonds is much larger than that of 8-fold bonds, the
system behaves as a branched polymer. a small number of 8-fold bonds may fold the
branched polymer into a lower-dimensional manifold. this can happen as in protein,
a chain of amino acids is folded into a lower-dimensional object like -sheet, by
perturbative interactions. since the hausdor dimension of the branched polymer is
four, the core interactions exclude the manifolds in less than four dimensions. thus,
four-dimensional space-time can be realized by this mechanism. we are checking
this conjecture by numerical simulations, which we mention later in this section.

on the other hand, if the 8-fold bonds dominate, the number of bonds are of
order 2n , twice as much as in the above case. thus, the entropy of graph rear-
rangement becomes more important, and the system might behave as a mean eld
phase, where all the n points condensate into a nite volume. however, the core
interactions prohibit an innite density state, and the system behaves as a droplet.
the 8-fold bond interaction can be written as
tr(s(ij))4  c 1...8ij

/(xij )16,

(3.18)

1  ij

26

h. aoki, s. iso, h. kawai, y. kitazawa, a. tsuchiya and t. tada

where c 1...8 is an invariant tensor, and v ij
 is a fourth rank symmetric
 . since v ij
traceless tensor constructed from xij
 is traceless, the average over
orientations of xij
 gives a suppression factor for each 8-fold bond. this suppression
factor becomes weak if the system becomes lower-dimensional. also, the  inte-
grations give contractions of v ij
 among dierent bonds, which consist of inner
 xkl  between dierent bonds. these angle-dependent interactions may
products xij
favor lower-dimensional space-time.

we can study self-consistently which phase is realized; 16-fold bond dominant
branched polymer phase or 8-fold bond dominant droplet phase. the phase with the
lowest free energy is realized. however, in any phase, four-dimensional space-time
can be realized by one of the above mentioned mechanisms or by some combinations
of them.

in the remainder of this section, we show how we perform numerical simulations.
our conjecture is that a small number of 8-fold bonds fold the branched polymer

and diagonalize it. the ten eigenvalues are the length squared in the principal axes
in ten dimensions. in this way, we analyze anisotropy of ten-dimensional space-time.
for example, if four of the eigenvalues are much larger than the others, and grow as
we take n large, it means space-time is four-dimensional.

figure 2 is our preliminary result.

in n = 800, two of the ten eigenvalues
are relatively large, suggesting the existence of anisotropy. we hope to see four
eigenvalues become larger as we increase n . however, in order to see this, we need
at least 4426  16, 000 points, which is quite a large number in the current computer
power. thus, we are trying to make some modications to the model (3.20) to study
the system with larger n . the results will be reported soon. 24)

4. symmetries in the low energy theory

4.1. local gauge invariance

once we describe the space-time as a dynamically generated distribution of the
eigenvalues, low-energy eective theory in the space-time can be obtained by solving
the dynamics of the uctuations around the background x. both of the space-time
x and matter a are unied in the same matrices a and should be determined
dynamically. low-energy uctuations are generally composites of a and , and it
is natural from the analysis of the schwinger-dyson equation for the wilson loops
that a local operator in space-time is given by a microscopic limit of the wilson loop
operators, such as

w(k; o) = tr[o(a, ) exp(ika)].

(4.1)

here, o(a, ) is some operator made of a and . in order to identify the total
momentum of this operator with k, the operator o(a, ) should be invariant under
a constant shift of a, that is, a translation in the space-time coordinates.

28

h. aoki, s. iso, h. kawai, y. kitazawa, a. tsuchiya and t. tada

in the rst approximation around the diagonal background x, the coordinate

representation of this operator is given by

d10k
w(x; o) = z
(2)10 exp(ikx) w(k; o)
xi=1


oii(10)(x  xi).

n

(4.2)

here, we have replaced a by x + a and taken the leading term. oii is the (ii)
component of the operator o. due to the delta function, the operator has support
only in the domain where the eigenvalues distribute. vanishing of the operator
w(x; o) outside of the domain of the distributed eigenvalues implies that space-time
simply does not exist outside the domain. this fact supports our interpretation of
the space-time in iib matrix model.

we can apply a similar analysis to strings which propagate in the space-time. in
the 1/n expansion, the correlation between wilson loop operators can be evaluated
by summing over all surfaces made of feynman diagrams connecting the wilson
loops at the boundary. this surface is interpreted as a string world sheet connecting
strings at the boundaries. each eigenvalue (xi
) associated to a loop in the diagrams
represents a coordinate on the world sheet, and it takes a value in the eigenvalue dis-
tribution in the leading approximation around the diagonal background x. hence,
a string world sheet evolves only in the space-time of the eigenvalue distribution,
which again supports our interpretation of space-time.

it is generally dicult to obtain how uctuations propagate in the eigenvalue
distribution, which is reminiscent of the qcd eective theory: in qcd excitations
are expressed as composite operators of microscopic variables, and their low-energy
dynamics can be discussed only through a symmetry argument, namely an argument
based on chiral symmetry. also, in our case, we will show that there are eigenvalue
distributions around which symmetry arguments allow us to discuss the low-energy
dynamics for some excitations. suppose that the eigenvalue distribution forms clus-
ters consisting of n eigenvalues. at a length scale much larger than the size of each
cluster, the su (n ) symmetry is broken down to su (n)m, where m = n/n.

we can expand a and  around such a background x similarly to the analysis

in the previous section. first, write a and  in block forms:

a =

each block, aij

 or ij, is an n  n matrix, and the diagonal blocks can be further

(4.4)

where 1 is an n  n unit matrix and tr aii
 = 0. here, tr means the trace for a
submatrix of n  n. we interpret each cluster of the eigenvalues as being a space-
time point with an internal structure su (n). since each su (n) symmetry acts on
the variables at position i independently, the unbroken su (n)m symmetry can be
regarded as being local gauge symmetry. indeed, under a gauge transformation of
the unbroken su (n)m symmetry,

(4.6)

some of the dynamics for low-energy excitations is governed by this local gauge
invariance. gauge elds live on the links and transform as the link variables in lattice
gauge theory. in our case, we have too many such elds (at least 10 boson elds aij

for a link (ij) ), but only one unitary link variable is assured to be massless by the
gauge symmetry, and the others acquire mass dynamically. therefore, in deriving
low-energy eective theory, we rst apply a polar decomposition to aij
 into unitary
and hermitian degrees of freedom, and identify all of the unitary components of aij

by setting them to be one common eld u ij on each link. we have to integrate those
massive o-diagonal block elds aij
 while keeping the unitary components u ij and
this procedure is performed by the following replacements:

aij
 = 0,
 = g2 
aij
  aji

(xij)2 u ij  u ji.

(4.7)

in the second equation, the factor, 1/(xij)2, corresponds to the propagation of the
hermitian degrees of freedom while the appearance of the link variable u ij corre-
sponds to keeping the unitary degrees of freedom. higher order correlations can be

30

h. aoki, s. iso, h. kawai, y. kitazawa, a. tsuchiya and t. tada

obtained by using wick theorem in general except ten-body correlation function for
aij
 . due to the chiralness of the ten-dimensional fermion, we obtain an extra term
proportional to 1...10, coming from fermion one-loop integral.

in order to derive the eective theory for uctuations around the assumed back-
ground, we integrate massive elds rst and obtain eective action for other elds
as we have obtained the eective action for the diagonal components (i.e., space-
time coordinates) in the previous section. generally speaking, we can expect any
terms which are not forbidden by symmetries; supersymmetry and local su (n) gauge
symmetry.

a plaquette action for gauge elds u ij can be generated as follows. the relevant

terms in the action are

s4 =

1

g2 xi6=j6=k6=l

tr(aij

 ajk

  aij

 ajk

 )akl

 ali
 .

(4.8)

by integrating out the hermitian degrees of freedom of the o-diagonal blocks with
the procedure (4.7), this action vanishes; s4 = 0. however, interactions generated
by (s4)2 induce a kinetic term for the gauge eld:

(s4)2  xi6=j6=k6=l

g4

(xij)2(xjk)2(xkl)2(xli)2 tr(u iju jku klu li)tr(u ilu lku kju ji). (4.9)

this is the plaquette action generated by a wilson loop for the adjoint representation,
and hence the gauge eld u ij indeed propagates in the space-time of the eigenvalue
distribution. the gauge eld can hop between any pair of space-time points, but the
hopping is suppressed by 1/x8 for distant points and we will recover locality in the
continuum limit. similarly we can obtain a gauge invariant hopping term for adjoint
fermion ii.

to summarize this subsection, supposing that the distribution of the eigenvalues
consists of small clusters of size n, we have shown that the low-energy eective theory
contains several massless elds, such as the gauge eld associated with the local
su (n) gauge symmetry and fermion eld in the adjoint representation of su (n)
gauge symmetry. gauge-invariant kinetic terms were also derived. our ndings
are reminiscent of those which are obtained by considering n coincident d9-branes.
presumably our argument here is related to the standard argument of coincident
d-branes.

our system is a lattice gauge theory on a dynamically generated random lattice.
it is invariant under a permutation for the set of the m discrete space-time points,
since the permutation group sm is a subgroup of the original su (n ) symmetry. the
existence of the permutation symmetry is the crucial dierence from the ordinary
lattice gauge theory on a xed lattice, which becomes important in deriving the
dieomorphism invariance of our model. we will come back to this point in the next
subsection. although the permutation invariance requires that all space-time points
are equivalent, locality in the space-time will be assured due to suppression of the
hopping term between distant points. in general, however, we need a sucient power
for the damping of the hopping terms in order to assure locality in the continuum

iib matrix model

31

limit. though we do not yet know the real condition for locality, we expect that
terms with lower powers are canceled due to supersymmetry or by averaging over
gauge elds.

4.2. dieomorphism invariance

as shown in 2, the one-loop eective action for the space-time points is de-
scribed as a statistical system of n points whose coordinates are xi
. integration
over the fermion zeromodes  gives the boltzmann weight, which depends on a graph
(or network) connecting the space-time points locally by the bond interactions:

z = xg:graphz dx w [x; g].

(4.10)

w [x; g] is a complicated function of a conguration x and a graph g. an im-
portant property is that the weight is suppressed at least by a damping factor of
1/(xi  xj)12, when two points, i and j, are connected. this system is, of course,
) of n space-time points, which is a subgroup of
invariant under permutations sn
the original symmetry su (n ), while the boltzmann weight for each graph g is not.
the invariance is realized by summing over all possible graphs.
in other words,
the system becomes permutation invariant by rearrangements of the bonds in the
network of the space-time points. this reminds us of the dynamical triangulation
approach to quantum gravity, 25) where dieomorphism invariance is believed to arise
from summing all possible triangulations. our system satises both the locality and
permutation invariance simultaneously by summing over all possible graphs whose
points are connected through the local interactions.

now we see that the permutation invariance of our system actually leads to
dieomorphism invariance. to see how the background metric is encoded in the
eective action for low-energy excitations, let us consider, as an example, a scalar
eld i propagating in distributed eigenvalues. the eective action will be given by

(i  j)2

s = xi,j

f (xi  xj) +xi

m(i)2,

(4.11)

where f (x) is a function decreasing suciently fast at innity to assure locality in
the space-time. introducing the density function of the eigenvalues,

(x) = xi

(10)(x  xi),

and a eld (x) which satises (xi) = i, the action can be rewritten as

(4.12)

(4.13)

s = z dxdyh(x)(y)i

) in this section we consider general eigenvalue distributions in which all eigenvalues have
nondegenerate space-time coordinates.
if we take the cluster type distribution considered in the
previous subsection, the permutation symmetry responsible for the dieomorphism invariance should
be sn/n.

here, the expectation, hi, for the density and the density correlation means that we
have taken average over congurations x and networks g of the space-time points.

normalizing the density correlation in terms of the density,

h(x)(y)i = h(x)ih(y)ir(x, y),

(4.14)

and expanding (x)  (y) = (x  y)(x) +   , the action becomes

s =

1

2z dxh(x)i(cid:20)z dyh(y)i(x  y)(x  y) f (x  y)r(x, y)(cid:21) (x) (x)
+mz dxh(x)i(x)2  .

(4.15)

this expansion shows that the eld (x) propagating in the eigenvalue distribution
feels the density correlation as the background metric, while the density itself as
vacuum expectation value of the dilaton eld. namely, we can identify

g (x)  z dyh(y)i(x  y)(x  y) f (x  y)r(x, y),
ge(x)  h(x)i.

(4.16)

(4.17)

if the density correlation respects the original translational and rotational symmetry,
that is, if they are not spontaneously broken, the metric becomes at, g   .
(normalization can be absorbed by the dilaton vev.) the fact that the background
metric is encoded in the density correlations indicates that our system is general co-
variant, even though the iib matrix model action (1.1) dened in at ten dimensions
does not have a manifest general covariance.

then, let us see how the dieomorphism invariance is realized in our model.
the action (1.1) is invariant under the permutation sn of the eigenvalues, which is
a subgroup of su (n ). under a permutation,

xi  x(i)

for   sn ,

(4.18)

the eld i transforms into (i). then, from the denition of the eld (x), we
should extend the transformation (4.18) into x,
x  (x),

(4.19)

such that (xi) = x(i). under this transformation, the eigenvalue density trans-
forms as a scalar density and the eld (x) as a scalar eld. on the other hand,
the metric transforms as a second-rank tensor, if the function f (x  y) decreases
rapidly around x = y and the y integral in eq. (4.16) has support only near y = x.
the tensor property of the metric is also required from the invariance of the action
under transformation (4.19). in this way, the invariance under a permutation of the
eigenvalues leads to the invariance of the low-energy eective action under general
coordinate transformations.

the background metric is encoded in the density correlation of the eigenvalues.
since we have started from the iib matrix model action (1.1) which is poincare-
invariant, the density correlation is expected to be translational and rotational in-
variant, and we may obtain a low-energy eective action in a at background. a

iib matrix model

nontrivial background can be induced dynamically if the lorentz symmetry is spon-
taneously broken and the eigenvalues are nontrivially distributed.

a nontrivial background can also be described by condensing a graviton opera-

tor. 26) bosonic parts of graviton and dilaton operators are given by

s (k)  tr(ff

eika) + (  ),

their condensation induces extra terms in the iib matrix model action,

(4.20)
(4.21)

(4.22)

scond = z dk(cid:16)x h (k)s (k) + h(k)d(k)(cid:17) .

we can similarly obtain an eective action for uctuations around a diagonal back-
ground from this modied matrix model action. condensation of dilaton changes the
yang-mills coupling constant g locally in space-time. since g is the only dimension-
ful constant in our model, and thus determines the fundamental length scale, a local
change in g leads to a local change in the eigenvalue density. this is consistent with
our earlier discussion that the dilaton expectation value is encoded in the eigenvalue
density. on the other hand, the condensation of graviton induces an asymmetry of
space-time. for a condensation of the k = 0 graviton mode, it is obvious that the
condensation can be compensated by a eld redenition of matrices a,

a  (

 + h

)a ,

(4.23)

and the two models, the original iib matrix model and the modied one with the
k = 0 graviton condensation, are directly related through the above eld redeni-
tion. the density of the eigenvalues is mapped accordingly, and the density cor-
relation is expected to become asymmetric in the modied matrix model. for a
more general condensation, if the graviton operator s(x) (coordinate representa-
tion of eq. (4.20)) changes only the local property of the dynamics of the eigenvalues,
the density correlation will become asymmetric locally in space-time around x, and
therefore induces a local change in the background metric.

our low-energy eective action is formulated as a lattice gauge theory on a dy-
namically generated random lattice. since the lattice itself is generated dynamically
from matrices, we must sum over all possible graphs.
in this way, our system is
permutation sn invariant, which is responsible for the dieomorphism invariance.
the background metric is encoded in the density correlation of the eigenvalues, and
the low-energy eective action becomes manifestly general covariant. the graviton
operator is represented as uctuation around the background space-time, and is con-
structed from the o-diagonal components of the matrices. a microscopic derivation
of the propagation of the graviton is dicult to obtain, but once we have claried
the underlying dieomorphism symmetry, it is natural that the low-energy eective
action for the graviton is described by the einstein hilbert action. by employing
this dieomorphism invariance and the supersymmetry, we will be able to derive the
low-energy behavior of the graviton multiplets, which will be reported in a separate
paper.

5. discussion

we have reviewed the current status of the type iib matrix model, which is

proposed as a constructive denition of superstring.

there are still several conceptual issues. we have obtained a nonabelian gauge
symmetry from the iib matrix model by assuming a particular eigenvalue distribu-
tion. this indicates that this vacuum is not a perturbative vacuum of the type iib
superstring. instead, we may wonder if this is a perturbative vacuum of a heterotic
string or a type i string realized in a nonperturbative way within the iib matrix
model. as we discussed in the introduction, our matrix model contains both of
the world sheets of the fundamental iib string and those of the d-strings. by a
semiclassical correspondence (1.8), we have identied a iib superstring in the schild
gauge where tr is interpreted as integration over a d-string world sheet. we can also
construct an f-string world sheet in terms of surfaces made of feynman diagrams,
whose su (n ) index represents the space-time coordinate of a world sheet point. in
both cases, if we assume an eigenvalue distribution consisting of small clusters, an
internal structure appears on the world sheet, and hence current algebra may arise
and there is a possibility to describe heterotic string within the type iib matrix
model.

another issue is how to describe global topology in the iib matrix model. a
simple example is a torus compactication. a possible procedure of torus compact-
ication 28) is to identify a with a + r by embedding a derivative operator into
our matrix conguration. therefore, n is taken as innity from the beginning. since
this procedure has a subtlety in the large n limit, we require a careful examination
of the double scaling limit.

we also do not yet know how we can describe chiral fermions in lower dimensions
after compactication.
if we naively consider a low energy eective theory on a
four-dimensional space-time generated by distributed eigenvalues, we will obtain
fermions with both chiralities. a possible mechanism to produce a chiral fermion is
to consider a compactied six-dimensional space-time with a nontrivial index, or a
parity violating background. we should replace the n  n block matrices considered
in 4 by (n +) (n +) matrices. size n part of a block represents the low energy
gauge symmetry as before. the rest of the innite size represents an internal space
with six dimensions, which should have a non-trivial index. for simplicity, let us
consider a two-dimensional internal space. then the following background

aii

aii

a1,

a = xi
5 =   0
6 =   0

aii

p ! ,
q !

gives the (ii) block components of a desired background. here a = 1  4 and p, q
are innite dimensional matrices satisfying [p, q] = i. this background is invariant
under u (n) u (1) in each block and this becomes the local gauge symmetry in four-

iib matrix model

35

dimensional space-time. the eective theory for low energy uctuations around the
background are similarly obtained as in 4. all the o-diagonal elds become massive
and we integrate them over except a gauge eld. in diagonal blocks, there are several
 or ii
elds that can be massless. writing uctuations in a diagonal block, o = aii
as

o =   oa o

of os ! ,

f

(5.1)

f on o

oa transforms as an adjoint representation, o
f as a fundamental representation and
os is a singlet for su (n) transformation. p or q acts like p o
f , and [p, os ]
on s-components. then we can show that we obtain a massless chiral fermion
with fundamental representation for gauge symmetry su (n), whose wavefunction
in (p, q) space is given by the groundstate wavefunction of a harmonic oscillator.
other possibly massless fermions are vector-like and will acquire mass unless they are
protected by supersymmetry. this is the simplest way to obtain a chiral fermion in
four-dimensional space-time. in this construction, all non-singlet elds transforming
as adjoint or fundamental representations live in four dimensions and localized at
x5 = x6 = 0. however, singlet elds including graviton propagate in the bulk (here,
six dimensions). in order to have a four-dimensional theory, we need to compactify
the internal six-dimensional space. this is discussed in a separate paper.

it is also desirable to construct ads type backgrounds in our approach. 29) let

us recall the metric of ads5  s5:
r2
ds2 =
z2 (d~x2 + dz2) + r2d2
5.

(5.2)

the volume factor g  1
z5 is sharply peaked at z = 0 in ads5. since we have
argued that g is proportional to the density distribution in iib matrix model,
such a background may be represented by the eigenvalue distribution which is also
sharply peaked at z = 0 namely at the four-dimensional boundary. the gauge
theory is obtained by assuming that the full su (n ) matrices are decomposed into the
clusters of submatrices of su (n) as we have argued. since the eigenvalue distribution
is essentially four-dimensional, the resulting low energy eective theory must be a
four-dimensional eld theory. if we further assume n = 4 supersymmetry in four
dimensions which must be present due to the conformal symmetry of ads5  s5,
we may conclude that the low energy eective theory for such a background of iib
matrix model is n = 4 super yang-mills theory.
