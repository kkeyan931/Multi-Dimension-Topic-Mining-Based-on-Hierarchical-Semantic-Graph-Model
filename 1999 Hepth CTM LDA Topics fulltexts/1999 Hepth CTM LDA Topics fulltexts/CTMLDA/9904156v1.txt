ferromagnetic systems in two spatial dimensions can be described by the landau-lifshitz
(ll) model [1] in the long wavelength limit. the discrete version of this model is equivalent
to the heisenberg model. this model involves time derivatives of the rst order only, and is
actually a nonrelativistic sigma model. the ll model is also equivalent to the nonrelativistic
cp 1 model [2]. the relativistic counterpart, i.e., the standard o(3) nonlinear sigma model
(nlsm), on the contrary, describes antiferromagnetic systems [3].

it was shown by nardelli [4] that the gauged nlsm containing an so(3) chern-simons
(cs) term admits a new kind of topological soliton which can not be chracterised by 2-the
second homotopy group, unlike nlsm. later, cho and kimm [5] generalized the result for
arbitrary cp n 1, where the global su(n) group is gauged and a corresponding cs term is
added. thus the question naturally arises, whether the gauged nonrelativistic cp 1 model also
admits topological solitons similar to its relativistic counterpart. we try to analyse this issue
in the present letter.

to this end, we consider the model given by

2(cid:20)(d0z)z  z (d0z)(cid:21)  |diz|2  a0(z z  1)

here we have introduced a triplet of real scalar (background) elds a, for reasons that will
become clear later, and z = (cid:18) z1
z2 (cid:19) is a complex doublet satisfying z z = 1.  represents the

cs parameter. the covariant derivatives are given by

d0 = 0  igaa
di = i  iai  igaa

(2)

with t a = a/2. here ai and aa
i represent the u(1) and su(2) gauge elds respectively.
note that since we are considering a non-relativistic model, we have the freedom to introduce
dierent temporal and spatial covariant derivatives in (2) without violating any principles.

as this nonrelativistic model is rst order in time derivative, the symplectic structure can
readily be obtained by using the faddeev-jackiw [6] method to yield the following brackets:

{z(x), z
i (x), ab

(y)} = i(x  y)
ab(x  y)

j(y)} =

g1 and g2
g2

a are the rst class gauss constraints of this model, and it can be shown that g1 and

a generate the appropriate u(1) and su(2) transformations respectively, i.e.,

z(x) = z d2yf (y){z(x), g1(y)} = if (x)z(x)
z(x) = z d2yf a(y){z(x), ga

is a unit vector obtained by using the hopf map. clearly, (7) and (8) form a pair of second
class constraints, and therefore are strongly implemented by the dirac bracket

{ai, j} = 0

(10)

with this, ai ceases to be an independent degree of freedom. it may be mentioned here that
the same thing happens to the u(1) gauge eld for the case of the gauged cp 1 model coupled
to the cs term in its relativistic avatar which was studied in [7].

one can show that ga

following the group theoretical arguments, as in [7], one can show that the following relations
between the gauss constraints are expected.

gg1 = m aga
2

(12)

this can be veried using m am a = (z z)2  1. this shows that g1 is not an independent
constraint, and, this model therefore, has only su(2) gauge invariance. this is again similar
to the case of the relativistic version of the gauged cp 1 model coupled to the hopf term [7].

we are now equipped to address the question of solitonic congurations [8] in this model.
to investigate the existence of solitons, consider the energy functional obtained from the hamil-
tonian density (3) (on the constraint surface(4)), which is given by

which can be rewritten as

where

e = z d2x(diz)(diz)

e = z d2x|(d1  id2)z|2  2n

n =

1

2i z d2xij(diz)(djz)

(13)

(14)

(15)

in order for solitons to exist, the corresponding static congurations must satisfy the saturation
condition

(d1  id2)z = 0

(16)

and n should be given by some number which may have a topological origin. note that n(15)
is su(2) gauge invariant, and so we can evaluate n in any gauge of our choice. at this stage
we rewrite n as

n =

1

4 z d2xij(cid:20)2iiz jz + gaa

i (jm a +

g
2

abcab

jm c)(cid:21)

(17)

by making use of the local su(2) gauge invariance of the model, we can go to a conguration
where z(x) = constant. correspondingly, m as are also constant, so that quantities like jz
and jm a vanish, and n (17) reduces to

n =

g2
4 z d2xabcm aab

1ac

(18)

on the other hand, the invariance under su(2) (global) transformation of the model (1)

implies the existence of the following triplet of conserved su(2) charges

qa = 2z d2x(1aa

2  2aa

(19)

as follows from noethers theorem.

j ), n becomes

in terms of the corresponding charge density j 0a =

n =

m a z d2x(cid:18)ba 

j 0a
2 (cid:19)

making use of the gauss constraint g2 (4), one can write

g2
16 z d2x(1  m aa) 
now if the background eld a satises the condition

n =

m aqa

then using (21) and (4) one gets

m aa = 1

n =

m aba = 0

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

note that all (m aa), (m aba), and (m aqa) are su(2) scalars.
at this point we make a particular gauge choice3 z = (cid:18) 0

1(cid:19). correspondingly, m a = a3,

and

b3 = 1a3

(25)

(26)

(just to remind the reader, the subscripts and superscripts of a stand for spatial and group
indices respectively.) note that in this gauge, one has only a surviving u(1) symmetry. this
corresponds to an so(2) rotation around the m 3 axis. q3 is the corresponding conserved

at innity, e(13) and n (15) are invariant under arbitrary gauge transformations.

(noether) charge. making use of (2) and (8), one of the saturation conditions (16), (i.e.,

(d1 + id2)z = 0) in the gauge z = (cid:18) 0

1(cid:19), can be shown to yield
a1

1 = a2

a1
2 = a2

using (26) and (27) one nds

q3 = 2g z d2x((a1

2)2 + (a2

and consequently (using (23)),

n =

q3 > 0

and the minimum value of energy is

e(min) = 2n =

g
4

q3 =

g2
2 z d2x(cid:18)(a1

1)2 + (a1

2)2(cid:19) > 0

one can easily check that the other saturation condition ((d1  id2)z = 0) yields

a1
1 = a2
2
2 = a2
1

a1

and q3 (26) becomes

with this, n is given as

q3 = 2g z d2x(cid:20)(a1

1)2 + (a1

2)2(cid:21)< 0

n =

g

q3 < 0

but now, emin is given by

emin = 2n = 

g
4

q3 =

g2
2 z d2x(cid:20)(a1

1)2 + (a1

2)2(cid:21)> 0

(27)

(28)

(29)

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

(34)

thus, either of the saturation conditions (16) yields the same (positive denite) value for emin
as desired. the only dierence is that the two conditions in (16) correspond to the positive
and negative values for the number n.

thus we must have either of the saturation conditions corresponding to the conguration

z = (cid:18) 0
1(cid:19). also note that for e(min) to be nite, a1 and a2 must vanish asymptotically.
thus asymptotically, b3 (25) becomes a u(1) magnetic eld with a3
i as the abelian gauge
eld. the points at innity can be identied, so that the two-dimensional plane gets eectively
compactied to s2. from (19), it then follows that q3 represents a topological index, which
is nothing but the rst chern class. clearly, emin ((30) and (34)) is given by a topological
index. thus these eld congurations satisfying either of the saturation conditions (27) or (31)
correspond to topological solitons, with positive or negative winding numbers (n). the same
holds for all other congurations obtained by gauge transformations. for example, for any other
conguration with z(x) = constant, the emin will be given by an appropriate qa obtained by
making a suitable so(3) rotation corresponding to the su(2) transformation required to get

z = constant conguration from z = (cid:18) 0

1(cid:19). but the value of emin will remain the same. it

is important to note that we had to choose a convenient gauge here to identify emin with a
topological index (up to a constant). it is rather nontrivial to make this identication in an
arbitrary gauge.

note further, that if in adition, a = m a, then ba = 0 (4) and aa

i are pure gauges. in this
case we can go to a gauge where aa
i = 0 and di|ai=0 = di (the covariant derivative operator
of the pure cp 1 model). here also n corresponds to the topological index (chern class) and
we have a topological soliton.

finally, note that for a = 0, the rst term in n (21) diverges, and there does not exist any
solitonic conguration. it was thus necessary to introduce a triplet of background scalar elds
a in (1), satisfying (22) in order to obtain solitonic congurations. this is in contrast to the
case of the relativistic model [5] and its reduced phase space version [7].
