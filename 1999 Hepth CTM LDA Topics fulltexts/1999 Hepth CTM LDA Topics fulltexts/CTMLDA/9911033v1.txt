abstract

a new approach proposed recently by author for the calculation of green functions in quantum
eld theory and quantum mechanics is briey reviewed. the method is applied to nonperturbative
calculations for anharmonic oscillator, 4-theory, quantum electrodynamics and other models.

1 toy model

to illustrate the general properties of the calculation scheme, which was proposed recently in works [1]-[3],
we consider a toy problem of the calculation of n-particle green functions in zero-dimensional theory
with 4-interaction, i.e., a problem of calculating the following quantities

where

gn = gn/g0,

gn = z 



d 2n exp{

m2
2

2  4}.

a generating function for these quantities is

g(x) = z 



d exp{

m2
2

2  4 + x2}.

at that gn = dng

dxn |x=0.

the generating function g(x) satises the dierential equation

which is the schwinger-dyson equation (sde) for this toy model.

a solution of this equation can be written as a coupling constant perturbation (ccp) series g(x) =

from the point of view of dierential equation theory the ccp is attributed to the type of so-called
singular perturbations. this fact denes, to a considerable extent, both the poor convergence properties
(the ccp series is an asymptotic expansion at best) and the limited nature of the eld of its applicability.
(in the model under consideration the ccp theory gives good results in the region   0.01m4 and nothing
more.) a perturbation is named to be singular if it contains a higher derivative term. the perturbation
theory over  is singular in the above sense, since the leading approximation consists in the neglecting of
the higher derivative term. (see [4], [2] for more discussion.)

an alternative for the perturbation theory over  can be other iterative scheme that based on an
approximation of eq. (1) near the point x = 0 by an equation with constant coecients. take as a
leading approximation the equation

(6)

leading approximation equation has the solution g(0) = ex, where s are roots of the characteristic
equation

42 + m2  1.

from a condition of the convergence of integral (3) at   0 we choose the root

 = m2 + m4 + 16

8

= 1/m2 + o().

a solution of nth-step equation is looked for in the form g(i) = p(i)g(0). taking into account the leading
approximation equation (5), we obtain the equation for p(i)

4(cid:16) d2p(i)

dx2 + 2

dp(i)

dx (cid:17) + m2 dp(i)

dx

= 2x(cid:16) dp(i1)

dx

+ p(i1)(cid:17).

(7)

it is evident from this equation that p(i) is a polynomial of degree 2i in x.

the question about a small parameter for the expansion dened by eqs. (5)-(7) arises. there is no
manifest small parameter for this expansion , but it is clear, that the expansion approximates well the
exact solution not only for small values of . really, in the strong coupling region    the rst-
step one-particle function g1 (propagator) approximates the exact result with accuracy of 26%, and
second-step one with accuracy 7%.

to be more exact, the question about the small parameter should be replaced by the question about a
convergence of the expansion. but the convergence of this iteration scheme can be easily proved. notice,
the iteration scheme dened by eqs. (5)-(7) is equivalent to iterations of the second kind volterra equation
with the continuous kernel. the convergence of the iteration of this equation is fullled by the textbook
theorem.

so, this regular expansion possesses the good convergency properties in the framework of this simple
zero-dimensional model and, more importantly, is a nonperturbative method of calculations of green
functions.

2 4-theory

let us go to the eld theory. consider the theory of a scalar eld (x) in the euclidean space ed with
the action

a() = z dx{

1
2

()2 +

m2
2

2 + 4}

(8)

(9)

and with the generating functional of green functions (vacuum expectation values)

g() = z d exp{a + }.

here (x, y) is a bilocal source,   r dxdy(x)(x, y)(y). a normalization constant is omitted. the

nth derivative of g over  with the source being switched o is the 2n-point (n-particle) green function.
the schwinger-dyson equation (sde) for the generating functional g() is a corollary of the identity

((y) exp{a + }).
taking into account the above denitions we get the sde for 4-theory

0 = z d

(11)

at d = 0 (zero-dimensional theory, or single-mode approximation) the functional derivatives transform
into usual ones, and eq. (11), after obvious redesignations, reduces to the ordinary dierential eq. (4).
at d = 1 the model corresponds to the quantum-mechanical anharmonic oscillator. at d  2 (eld
theory) for the cancellation of ultraviolet divergences the appropriate counterterms should be included
in the action. the sde for the theory with counterterms has the form of eq. (11) with the substitution
   + , m2  m2 + m2, 2  (1 + z)2, where , m2 and z are correspondingly counterterms
of coupling, mass and wave function renormalizations.
let apply to sde (11) the same idea about the approximation by an equation with constant (i.e.,

independent from ) coecients. as the leading approximation equation we will consider the equation

4

2g(0)


+ (m2   2)

g(0)
  g(0) = 0,

(12)

and the term 2 g
 (that contains the source  explicitly) should be treated as a perturbation. since
green functions are the derivatives of g() in zero and the only behaviour of g near  = 0 is essential
, such an approximation seems to be acceptable. the iteration procedure for the generating functional
g = g(0) + g(1) +  + g(i) +  consists in the step-to-step solution of the equations

4

2g(i)


+ (m2   2)

g(i)
  g(i) = 2

g(i1)



.

the solution of the leading approximation equation (10) is the functional

g(0) = exp{z dxdy(y, x) (0) (x  y)},

where (0) is a solution of the characteristic equation

4 (0) (0) (0) (x  y) + (m2   2) (0) (x  y) = (x  y).

(13)

(14)

(15)

at d  2 the quantity (0)(0) must be considered as some regularization.
equation (15) is similar to the equation for the propagator in the leading approximation of the 1/n -
expansion. certainly, the similarity is completely supercial, since the principle of the construction of
the approximation scheme is dierent.

the solution of equation (15) is the free propagator (0) = (2   2)1 with the renormalized mass
2 = m2+4(0)(0). the quantity (0)(0) is dened from the self-consistency condition. the propagator
is the rst derivative of g() over the source  : g1   = g
 | =0. as can be easily seen, it is simply
(0) for the leading approximation.
notice, that the generating functional (14) of leading approximation does not possess the complete
bose-symmetry. really, as follows from the denition of generating functional, the bose-symmetry implies
on full generating functional the condition

2g

(y, x)(y , x)

=

2g

(y , x)(y, x)

.

(16)

evidently condition (16) does not fullled for g(0) dened by eq.(14). the violation of this condition leads
particularly to the violation of connected structure of the leading approximation two-particle (four-point)
green function.

such a situation is rather typical for nonperturbative calculational schemes with bilocal source (for
example, for 1/n -expansion in the bilocal source formalism), but discrepancy of such type are not an
obstacle for using these iteration schemes. really, condition (16) should be satised by the full generating
functional g which is an exact solution of sde. it is clear that an approximate solution may do not
possess all properties of an exact one.
in given case we have just the same situation. properties of
connectivity and bose-symmetry of higher green functions, which are not fullled at rst steps of the
iteration scheme, improves at subsequent steps. for example, the structure of disconnected part of the
two-particle function is reconstructed as early as at the rst step of the iteration scheme. at subsequent

3

steps the correct connected structure of many-electron functions and other corollaries of bose-symmetry
are reconstructed. such stepwise reconstruction of exact solution properties is very natural for the given
iteration scheme as it is based on an approximation of the generating functional g() in vicinity of
zero. the green functions are coecients of the generating functional expansion in the vicinity of zero,
therefore only the lowest functions are well-described at rst steps of the approximation  at the leading
approximation the propagator only. higher many-particle functions come into the play later, at following
steps, and relation (16) is fullled more and more exactly when we go toward exact solution.

in the general case, the solution of equation for the i-th step of the iteration scheme is the functional
g(i) = p (i)g(0), where p (i) is a polynomial in  of a degree 2i. therefore at the i-th step the computation
of green functions reduces to solving a system of 2i linear integral equations.

a solution of the rst step equation is g(1) = p (1)g(0) where p (1) = 1

2 f 2 +(1). the function f is
two-particle (four-point) function of the rst step, and (1) is the rst-step correction to the propagator.
eq.(13) at i = 1 gives us a system of equations for f and (1). equations for f and (1) are simple
linear integral equations. the exact form of solutions of these equations see in [1]. at   0 the rst
step propagator reproduces correctly the rst term of the usual ccp theory.
at d = 1 the model with action (6) describes the quantum-mechanical anharmonic oscillator. ultra-
violet divergences are absent, quantities of (0)(0) type are nite and the above formulae are applied
directly for the computation of green functions.

to calculate a ground state energy e one can use the well-known formula

de
d

= g2(0, 0, 0, 0),

where g2 is the four-point (or two-particle) function. integrating the formula with a boundary condition
e( = 0) = m/2 taken into account, one can calculate the ground state energy for all values of the
coupling (see [1]).

0

at   0 the rst step calculation reproduces the perturbation theory up to the second order.
at    : e = 01/3 + o(1/3), and 0 = 0.756. the coecient 0 diers by 13% from the exact
= 0.668. at /m3 = 0.1 the result of the calculation diers from the exact numerical
numerical one exact
one by 0.8% and at /m3 = 1 diers by 6.3%. therefore, the rst step calculations approximate the
ground state energy for all values of  with the accuracy that varies smoothly from 0 (at   0) to 13%
(at   ).
at d  2 action (6) should be added by counterterms for the elimination of ultraviolet divergences.
there is no need to add a counterterm of wave function renormalization for the leading approximation,
and the equation of the leading approximation will be

4( + 0)

2g(0)


+ (m2

0 + m2   2)

g(0)
  g(0) = 0.

(17)

at i  1 the counterterms i, m2
corresponding terms should be added to the r.h.s. of equation (11). so, the rst step equation will be

i and zi should be considered as perturbations. therefore, the

(18)

for the super-renormalizable theory (d = 2 and d = 3) it is sucient to add counterterms of mass
renormalization and wave function renormalization, i.e. i = 0 for all n. the normalization condition
on the physical renormalized mass 2 gives us a counterterm of the mass renormalization in the leading
approximation. this counterterm diverges logarithmically at d = 2 and linearly at d = 3. the countert-
erm z1 is nite at d = 2, 3. the counterterm m2
1 diverges as that of the leading approximation does,
namely, logarithmically at d = 2 and linearly at d = 3.

at d = 4 besides the renormalizations of the mass and the wave function a coupling renormalization
is necessary. due to the presence of the counterterm  the normalization condition on the renormalized

mass 2 for the leading approximation becomes the connection between counterterms m2

0 and 0.

a solution of the equation for the four-point function f at d = 4 diverges logarithmically, and a
renormalization of the coupling is necessary. the equation for f contains the counterterm 0 only.
therefore by dening a renormalized coupling r as a value of the amplitude in a normalization point
we obtain the counterterm of the coupling renormalization 0 and the renormalized amplitude. taking
the renormalization of the two-particle amplitude in such a manner, one can solve the equation for (1)
and renormalize the mass operator in correspondence with the general principle of normalization on
the physical mass. but in four-dimensional case one gets an essential obstacle. at the regularization
removing, 0  , and the coecient  + 0 in the leading approximation equation (17) vanishes.
the same is true for all the subsequent iterations. the theory is trivialized. one can object that an
expression

( + 0) 

(y, x)(x, x)

2g

(19)

is really an indenite quantity of 0   type, and the renormalization is, in the essence, a denition of
the quantity. but it does not save a situation in this case since the renormalized amplitude possesses
a nonphysical singularity in a deep-euclidean region (it is a well-known landau pole). the unique
noncontradictory possibility is a choice r  0 at the regularization removed. this is the triviality of the
theory again. the triviality appears almost inevitably in an investigation of 4
4-theory beyond the ccp
theory and is a practically rigorous result. notice, that contrary to the ccp theory which is absolutely
nonsensitive to the triviality of the theory, the method proposed leads to the triviality already at the rst
step.

from the point of view of exact solutions equations (26) and (28) are fully equivalent since the transition
from eq.(26) to eq.(28) is, in essence, an identical transformation. however, it is not the case for the
used iteration scheme since, as for bose-symmetry condition (16) as, fermi-symmetry condition (27) is
fullled only approximately at any nite step of the iteration scheme. therefore, eqs. (26) and (28) lead
to dierent expansions. eq.(26) gives to the calculational scheme, which on the language of feynman
diagrams of perturbation theory is analog of the summation of chain diagrams with fermion loop. this
version is named calculations over perturbative vacuum since a unique connected green function of
the leading (vacuum) approximation is the free electron propagator. this scheme leads, as for 4-theory
as (see above, section 2), to landau pole and triviality at the rst step of the iteration scheme (see [5]
for more details).

the second version of the iteration scheme, which is based on eq.(28), gives us a fruitful and insen-
sitive to triviality scheme of calculation of physical quantities. this version is named calculations over
nonperturbative vacuum since the electron propagator of the leading vacuum approximation is a solution
of a non-trivial nonlinear equation. for this scheme a calculation of two rst terms of expansion of the
vertex function in photon momentum for chiral-symmetric vacuum have been performed in work [5]. this
calculation has allowed to obtain a simple formula for anomalous magnetic moment: f2 = /(2  ),
where  is the ne structure constant. also, for a linearized version of the theory (see, for instance, [6])
the problem of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking have been investigated in work [5]. the calculations
are performed for renormalized theory in minkowski space. in the strong coupling region   /3 the
results correspond to earlier investigations performed in euclidean theory with cuto (see [6]): solutions
arise with breakdown of chiral symmetry. but for the renormalized theory a solution with breakdown of
chiral symmetry is also possible in the weak coupling region  < /3 with a subsidiary condition on the
value of  which follows from the gauge invariance (see [5] for more details).

4 other models

some other models have been investigated by proposed method in works [2]-[3] and [7]-[9]. famous
gross-neveu model with the lagrangian

l = ji j +


2n

( j j)2

(29)

have been investigated by this method in work [3] at d = 2, 3, 4 and nite n , where d is space dimension
and n is a number of avors. the results were following: a spontaneous symmetry breaking is shown
to exist in d = 2, 3 and the running coupling constant is calculated. the four dimensional theory turns

6

seems be trivial. these results exhibit the eciency of the method and are the nite n generalization of
the known results obtained in the framework of 1/n expansion.

the greatest interest from the physical point of view presents applications of the method to study
gauge theories in nonperturbative region. first steps in this direction were made in works [7]-[9]. in
work [7] a generalization of the higgs mechanism which takes into account the contributions of gauge
eld vacuum conguration into the formation of the physical vacuum was considered. for the abelian
higgs model the triviality bound mh  1.15ma was found. in works [8]-[9] a non-abelian su (2) gauge
theory was considered, and a mechanism for the dynamical mass generation of a non-abelian gauge
eld which was based on taking into account the contributions of the gauge eld vacuum congurations
into the formation of the physical vacuum was proposed. these investigations are needed in a following
elaboration. a most winning eld of application of proposed method seems to be a problem of dynamical
chiral symmetry breaking in gauge theories.
