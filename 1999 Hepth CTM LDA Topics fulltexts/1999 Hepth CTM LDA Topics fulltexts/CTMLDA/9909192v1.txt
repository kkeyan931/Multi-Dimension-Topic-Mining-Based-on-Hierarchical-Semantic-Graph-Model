abstract

it is shown that the auxiliary eld in the low-energy eective theory
of the supersymmetric qcd (su(nc) gauge symmetry with avors
nf < nc) can be understood as a physical degree of freedom, once the
supersymmetry is explicitly broken. although the vacuum expectation
value of the auxiliary eld is just a measure of the supersymmetry
breaking in the perturbative treatment of the supersymmetry breaking,
it can be the vacuum expectation value of the quark bilinear operator
in the non-perturbative treatment of the supersymmetry breaking. we
show that the vacuum expectation value remains nite in the limit of
the innite supersymmetry-breaking mass of the squark. we have to
take the large nc limit simultaneously to keep the low-energy eective
kahler potential being in good approximation.

introduction

it is natural to attempt extracting some non-perturbative information on
the non-supersymmetric gauge theory from the supersymmetric one by in-
troducing the explicit supersymmetry breaking, since some non-perturbative
eects can be reliably evaluated in the latter theory[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. in
case of studying qcd using the supersymmetric qcd (sqcd) 1 there is a
problem of physical degrees of freedom[9]. in the low-energy eective theory
of sqcd there is no physical eld which can correspond to the low-energy
eective eld in qcd. all the physical low-energy eective elds in sqcd
describe the bound states which include at least one squark, and there is
no eective eld corresponding to the bound state whose constituents are
quarks only. the auxiliary eld in the eective meson supereld seems to
correspond to the bound sates of two quarks (mesons)[9], but it is not clear
if the auxiliary eld really can be a physical degree of freedom 2[11].

in this note we show that the auxiliary component of the eective su-
pereld in sqcd with nf < nc can be understood as a physical degree
of freedom. we introduce the supersymmetry-breaking squark mass in the
ultraviolet theory, and construct its low-energy eective theory following the
method in refs.[12, 13, 14]. it gives the scalar potential which is described
by two scalar elds, the rst and auxiliary components of the eective su-
pereld, and the vacuum expectation values (vev) of these elds can be
obtained. if we naively take the limit of the innite squark mass, the vev
of the auxiliary eld diverges. this result does not mean the unphysical
nature of the eld, but the bad approximation for the eective kahler po-
tential. if we take large nc limit simultaneously, the vev of the auxiliary
eld remains nite, and the auxiliary eld can be understood as a physical
degree of freedom corresponding to the meson in qcd. large nc limit is
required to keep the eective kahler potential in good approximation.

2 sqcd with explicit supersymmetry breaking

the lagrangian of the supersymmetric su(nc) gauge theory (nc > 2) with
avors nf < nc is

l = z d4k +(cid:26) 1

trz d2w w  + h.c.(cid:27)

1 in this letter we use the word qcd to indicate general vector-like su(nc) gauge

theories with nf avors

2 the low-energy eective scalar eld with mass dimension three, which is the same

mass dimension of the auxiliary eld, is successfully utilized in ref.[10].

and

k = q

i e2gv qi + qie2gv t qi,

(2)
where qi and qi are quark chiral superelds with avor index i, v and
w  are the gluon vector supereld and its eld strength chiral supereld,
respectively, and g is the gauge coupling (see ref.[15] for notation). the
supersymmetry-breaking mass for squarks can be introduced as

lm = z d4xk,

(3)

where x is an interpolating vector supereld whose highest component has
a vev hxi = 2 2m2. in the innite mass limit the theory becomes non-
supersymmetric qcd with an adjoint fermion.
it is known that the low-energy eective eld of this theory with m = 0

is the gauge singlet chiral supereld

j  qi qj.

the correspondence of its component elds to the composite operators in
the fundamental theory is

auxiliary component,

(5)

(6)

(7)

where the auxiliary elds of quarks are integrated out by using the equation
of motion. note that the auxiliary eld fm corresponds to the quark bilinear
operator. the low-energy eective theory is described as

le = z d4k e +(cid:26)z d2wdyn + h.c.(cid:27) ,

where wdyn is the dynamically generated superpotential

wdyn = (nc  nf )  3ncnf

(9)

and  is the scale of dynamics[12]. it is very dicult to obtain the exact
eective kahler potential. we use

k e = 2trm m

(10)

2

which is eective in the weak coupling limit and describes the theory on the
classical at direction [13, 14].

the supersymmetry breaking eect due to x can be introduced to the
eective theory by including the terms which are the general functions of x
and m . since x is a vector supereld and we can consider as x 2 = 0, only
the kahler potential has correction of the form

k e

m = xf (m , m )

(11)

in the low-energy limit, where f is a real function. we estimate the function
f as follows.

since the kahler potential of eq.(10) is obtained by a simple replacement
of eq.(2) based on the identication of eq.(4), we may be able to do the
same replacement in eq.(3). but the replacement itself must be modied by
the supersymmetry breaking eect. from the condition of the at direction,
we have[13]

( q q)i

k( q q)k

j = ( qq)i

k(q q)k

j.

(12)

in the supersymmetric case the right hand side is simply replaced by m m ,
but now we should have

( q q)i

k( q q)k

j = m i

km k

j + xg(m , m )i

j,

where g is a real function of m  and m . this relation results

(13)

(14)

(15)

therefore, we have

tr(cid:16) q q(cid:17) = trm m +
xtr(cid:16)(m m ) 1
f (m , m ) = 2trm m + tr(cid:16)(m m ) 1

2 g(m , m )(cid:17) .

2 g(m , m )(cid:17)

in the weak coupling limit. the result of this note indicates that the rst
term dominates the second term in large nc limit. here, we simply neglect
the second term. the eective theory which we are going to analyze is

l = z d4 (1 + x) k e +(cid:26)z d2wdyn + h.c.(cid:27) .

(16)

we can obtain the eective scalar potential from this lagrangian. for
simplicity, we assume that the vev of the eective eld is avor diagonal:

if we perturbatively solve the stationary conditions, v /a = 0 and
v /f = 0, the vev of the auxiliary eld is simply proportional to m2,
and it is merely a measure of the supersymmetry breaking (some regulator
interaction, wreg = det m/2nf 3, for example, must be introduced to have
a nite vev of a in the supersymmetric limit). we can easily solve the
stationary conditions without any approximation. the result is

3 decoupling limit and vev of the auxiliary eld

before taking the limit of m  , the scale of dynamics at low energies, ,
must be specied. since we take m very large in comparison with any other
scales of dynamics, the matching condition of the running gauge coupling at
one-loop can be utilized. the scale  can be described by the scale  and
m as

 = (cid:18) 
m(cid:19)
where b  3nc  nf and b  3nc  2

in m   limit with xed , f diverges, though a vanishes as expected.
this is because of a truncation in the eective kahler potential in the pre-
vious section. we show that we can obtain a convincing result in large nc

limit, which indicates that the rst term in eq.(15) dominates the second
term in large nc limit.

to take a correct large nc limit the scales of dynamics,  and , should

not depend on nc. this requires that

should be a nite value. if we take the nite value as 1/6 ( > 1 because

in large m and nc limit. the uncertainty of the value of  corresponds
to the ambiguity in the present determination of the scale of dynamics at
low energies. now we have a nite value of f and vanishing a which is
required to have non-decoupling quarks. this result shows that the auxiliary
eld can be understood as a physical degree of freedom.

we note that the kahler potential of eq.(10) is in good approximation,
since the value of the gauge coupling in the supersymmetric theory at the
scale  which is the typical scale of the low-energy physics is small.

(26)

we also note that f diverges in this large m and nc limit, if we assume
the naive eective kahler potential k e

naive  tr(m m )/2.

the next question is which degree of freedom in the underlying theory
corresponds to the auxiliary eld. as described in eq.(7), it is natural to
consider that the quark bilinear operator corresponds to the auxiliary eld,
though the large nc scaling is dierent (hq qi  nc). this means that
the coecient which should be determined by the dynamics depends on nc.
namely,

4 conclusion

it has been shown that the auxiliary component of the low-energy eective
chiral supereld in the supersymmetric qcd (nf < nc) with explicit su-
persymmetry breaking can be understood as a physical degree of freedom.
supersymmetry was explicitly broken by the squark mass m, and the large
m limit was considered to obtain the non-supersymmetric theory: qcd with
an adjoint fermion. large nc limit was required to keep the eective kahler
potential in good approximation. the nite vacuum expectation value of
the auxiliary eld was obtained in the limit, which means that the auxiliary
eld can be a physical degree of freedom in the non-supersymmetric theory.
it can be identied to the quark bilinear operator with a coecient of 1/nc
scaling or the meson eld with a coecient of 1/nc scaling.
