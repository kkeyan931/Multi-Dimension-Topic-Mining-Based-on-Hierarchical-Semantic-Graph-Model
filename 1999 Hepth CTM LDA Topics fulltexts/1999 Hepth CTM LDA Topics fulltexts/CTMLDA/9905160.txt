(3) equation, x position coordinate wavefunc- tions corresponding various levels string. sum goes 3 possible products s, normal ordered avoid possible singular expressions. imposing commutation relations eq.(1) ansatz result set equations s, identify string eld equations. equations easy write down; solving another matter. practical method seems perturbation expansion around background, explicitly known solution algebra. therefore, although equations background indepen- dent, perturbative solution depend background. paper, expand ls around free eld solution eq.(2), corresponding background. setting gives lm = l(0) + km,   +  (m n)km+n = 0. (4) assumed central charges l(0)s ls same. next section, investigate systematically linear part equation, dropping last term quadratic ks:   (m n)km+n = 0. (5) eq.(5) similar equation motion non-abelian chern-simons gauge theory, dierence ordinary commuting coordinate deriva- tives replaced non-commuting operators l(0) . important prop- erty shares theory invariance transformations lm u 1lmu, (6) u arbitrary unitary operator constructed x s. transformations identied gauge transformations dynamics invariant. play important role follows. linearized equations invariant abelian part gauge transformations: km km + .

(8) easy nd special solutions eq.(5) standard vertex construction. vertex operator, given v (k, ) =: exp (ik.x( )) : (9) x ( ) = x + 0 + x1 satises relation 1 (cid:16)eim eim m(cid:17) ,  = eim (v (k, )) + 1 2 k2eim v (k, ). (10) result, set ks equal vertex tachyon emission: km = eim v (k, ), (11) condition k2 = 2, eq.(5) satised k satises tachyon mass shell condition. furthermore, solution abelian; dierent ks commute, result, satises initial exact equation (4). also note dierent values parameter correspond gauge equivalent results, since (cid:20)lm,z 2 1 v (k, )(cid:21) = i(cid:16)eim2 v (k, 2) eim1 v (k, 1)(cid:17) . (12) one easily construct innite number additional solutions ks replacing tachyon emision vertex emission vertices higher excited states. solution given also generalizes closed string. case, two commuting set operators, s, two commuting set virasoro algebras generated ls ls. let v denote 5 vertex operator eq.(8), constructed instead s. then, corresponding ks ks given km = z 2 km = z 2 0 0 eim( ) v (k, )v (k, + ), eim( +) v (k, )v (k, + ), (13) k2 = 2. case, solution satises linearized equations. again, ver- tices emission excited states provide additional solutions. wish analyze linear equations ks general, using operator expansion eq.(3). found convenient carry analysis amounts phase space representation operators. representattion, one one correspondonce set normal ordered operator products set states. states constructed following procedure: first, new set operators, m, commute s, introduced, well new c-number momentum p, commutes x. next, old non-commuting set operators replaced new set commuting operators according recipe km |mi, m, m, 0 = p, > 0. finally, application resulting operator vacuum gives state associated original operator. example, normal ordered operator product (x) 0 n corresponds state (x) p n|0i. according denition normal product, operators always placed right (x). 0 = shall need expressions l(0) acting states. start general normal ordered operator product, compute com- mutator l(0) given eq.(2). original operator product, well 6 nal commutator, represented states, explained above. therefore mapping one set states another induced l(0) s, mapping provides us representation dierent eq.(2) l(0)s. call state representation l(0)s designate symbol confusion arise. straightforward compute explicit expressions l(0)s new representation; however, stand, expressions bit complicated. simplied considerably making additional canonical transformation m, m, > 0. avoid complicating notation, use letters new set operators, understood that, on, stand new set operators. finally, following simple result: l(0) l l m, (14) l given eq.(2) l identical expansions terms s. change denition zero modes; given 0 = p i, 0 = p . (15) lack symmetry zero modes due particular nor- mal ordering prescription operators x discussed earlier. also note l(0)s dened eq.(14) central charge. expected, since action l(0)s states dened commutators corresponding operators, central charge drops picture since commutes everything. linearized equations(eq.(5)), new language, (cid:16)l l m(cid:17) |ni (cid:16)l n l n(cid:17) |mi (m n)|m + ni = 0, (16) state |mi replaced operator km. language new states, hermiticity properties original operator products bit complicated. hermitian conjugation operator product corresponds following interchange corresponding states: m, , |mi | mi, p p i. (17) 7 3. solutions linear equations open string section, investigate linearized equations open string (eqn.(5) ), connect solutions well-known states free bosonic string. rst sight, seems many states many independent variables. instead single string state, innitely many labeled integer m. also, number coordinates doubled compared standard string picture. states constructed using two new sets operators: addition s, p addition x. hand, also large set gauge transformations given eq.(7), translate |mi |mi +(cid:16)l l m(cid:17) |gi, (18) |gi represents arbitrary gauge state. shall show, equiva- lence gauge transformations drastically reduce number independent states; state = 1 turn inde- pendent. also, state function x, p . reduction original set non-commuting coordinates nal set commuting coordinates accomplished (partial) gauge xing. see this, let us organize states follows: consider expansion states powers p, label term expansion np, number factors p contains. addition, label level numbers n n; respectively eigenvalues operators n = n = x1 x1 mm, mm. given state |mi therefore written sum: |mi = xnp,n,n |m, n, n, npi. (19) note ns non-negative integers. also, easy show dierence n n term expansion. 8 focus state = 1. principle, could started value m, turns particular value special properties makes easy work with. wish establish following two results: a) expansion state, terms either np n greater zero gauged away. b) xing gauge, complete solution eq.(16) expressed terms single remaining component | 1i, namely | 1, n, 0, 0i. state, depends x s, identied usual string state. furthermore, show satises correct mass shell equation subsidiary conditions. since contemplating expansion powers p, convenient seperate ls two parts; one linear p p independent: l = l m(0) + p.m, l = l m(0) + p.m. condition state | 1, n, n, npi spurious (pure gauge) follows eq.(18). gauge states |g, n, n, npi, satisfying equation 1 (0)|g, n, n + 1, npi = | 1, n, n, npi + l l +p.1|g, n 1, n, np 1i + p.1|g, n, n + 1, np 1i, 1(0)|g, n 1, n, npi (20) found, state spurious. wish show equation solutions states either n np greater equal 1. basic idea solve iteration, starting smallest values n np working larger values. gauge states corresponding smallest value n, n = 0, determined equation, set equal zero simplicity. starting n = 0, note special case, since left hand side eq.(20) vanishes: l 1 (0)|n = 1i = 0. (21) case, solve gauge state |g, n, 1, npi inverting operator p.1: |g, n, 1, npi = 1 (np + 1)! 1. p (| 1, n, 0, np + 1i) . (22) 9 shows = 1 states n = 0 np 1 gauged away. let us consider next set states n = 2. case, write |g, n, n + 1, npi = (cid:16)l +p.1|g, n 1, n, np 1i + p.1|g, n, n + 1, np 1i(cid:17). 1 (0)(cid:17)1(cid:16)| 1, n, n, npi + l 1(0)|g, n 1, n, npi (23) note states right hand side equation n 1, acting states, operator l 1 (0) invertible. contrast previous case when, acting states n = 0, l 1 (0) invertible, eq.(20) n = 1 treated special case. taking n = 1 np = 0 eq.(23), right hand side equation completely known. gauge states n = 1 already known (eq.(22)), last term right hand side vanishes since state np = 1. left hand side equation gives us gauge states n = 2 np = 0. take np = 1 n = 1; right hand side completely known, recycling equation gives us gauge states n = 2 np = 1. continuing iteration, gauge states n = 2 arbitrary np determined. next set n = 2 eq.(23) continue double iteration process till gauge states values n np determined. argument establishes result states | 1, n, n, npi either n,np greater equal 1 gauged away. shown surviving piece state = 1 n = 0 np = 0, derive equation satised state. first setting n = 1, 0 eq.(16), projecting n = 0, np = 0 component, l m(0)| 1, n + m, 0, 0i l (m + 1)|m 1, n, 0, 0i = 0. 1(0)|m, n 1, 0, 0i (24) notice l n = 0 sector, neither l special case = 0 equation: m(0) contribute 0 projection 1 (0) eq.(21). consider (l 0 (0) 1) | 1, n, 0, 0i l 1(0)|0, n 1, 0, 0i = 0. (25) 10 argue state |0, n 1, 0, 0i gauged away. gauge transformations, |0, n, 0, 0i |0, n, 0, 0i + l 0 (0)|g, n, 0, 0i. operator l 0 (0) always invertible, since contains term form 2 0 = , always inverted. therefore, suitable gauge state always chosen make last term eq.(25) vanish. gauge choice, standard mass shell condition: (l 0 (0) 1) | 1, n, 0, 0i = 0. (26) important notice choice = 1 state question crucial arriving mass shell condition given above. choice m, would extra terms corresponding equation; example, analogue eq. (22) = 2, l 2 (0)|n = 2i = 0 simply true. possible go beyond mass shell condition establish standard subsidiary conditions l m(0)| 1, n, 0, 0i = 0, 1, (27) showing states |m, n, 0, 0i 1 gauged away. done, example, adaptation standard string theory argument. established state |1, n, 0, 0i made satisfy standard string equations (eqs.(26) (27)), next step show that, gauge xing, states, gauge equivalence, determined terms single state. section (6), shown using brst method; here, illustrate process works simple example, construct explicit solution states n = 1 np = 0 0. take n = 1, 0 eq.(16), project component corresponding n = 0 np = 1: m(0)| 1, n + m, 0, 1i l l +p.m | 1, n + m, 0, 0i + p.1 |m, n, 1, 0i = 0. 1(0)|m, n 1, 0, 1i (m + 1)|m 1, n, 0, 1i (28) 11 equation, state | 1, n + m, 0, 1i vanishes previous gauge choice. following ansatz provides solution; |m, n, 0, 1i = 0, 0, |0, n, 1, 0i = i1. | 1, n, 0, 0i, |m, n, 1, 0i = 1.m| 1, n + m, 0, 0i 1. (29) consistency check: solution given also satisfy n = 1,np = 0 component eq.(16) m, n 0, m(0)|n, n + m, 1, 0i l l m,0|n, n, 1, 0i + n,0|m, n, 1, 0i = 0, n(0)|m, n + n, 10i (m n)|m + n, n, 1, 0i (30) indeed does. principle, solutions higher values n np, well negative values constructed fashion, although brute force method soon becomes laborious. close section comments gauge invariance. starting rich gauge group (eq.(18)), good deal gauge xing done arrive string equations (26) (27) |1, n, 0, 0i, candidate physical string state. is, however, still invariance residual gauge transformations | 1, n, 0, 0i | 1, n, 0, 0i + l 1(0)|g, n 1, 0, 0i, (31) gauge state satises l 0 (0)|g, n 1, 0, 0i = 0. well-known invariance shift zero norm states gen- erated l1, valid dimension. misssing invariance shifts zero norm states generated lms > 1, valid critical dimension. really troublesome puzzle, following tentative suggestion solution. possible choice state = 1, n = np = 0 physical string state, although advantage simplifying vari- ous computations, suitable fully understanding residual gauge invariance. example, choice state |s, n, 0, 0i = n xm=1 12 |m, n, 0, 0i, (32) physical state advantage that, gauge transformations, |s, n, 0, 0i |s, n, 0, 0i + n xm=1 l m(0)|g, n m, 0, 0i, (33) gauge states generated lms, l1. however, found states type dicult work pursue point further. 4.solutions linear equations closed string section, briey discuss solutions linear closed string equations. treatment less complete compared case open string. operators km km replaced states |mi | mi. two copies equation (16), plus equation expressing commutativity two virasoro algebras (eq.(8)): l(0) |ni l(0) l(0) |ni l(0) l(0) |ni l(0) n |mi (m n)|m + ni = 0, n | mi (m n)| + ni = 0, n | mi = 0, where, l(0) = l l m, l(0) = l l m. gauge transformations given |mi |mi + lm|gi, | mi | mi + lm|gi. (34) (35) (36) (37) discussion closed string states brief less complete compared open string. last section, expand states powers p level numbers n, n, now, addition, level numbers n n . states thus labeled |m, n, n, n , n , npi, | m, n, n, n , n , npi. usual constraint right-left level numbers requires n n = n n . (38) 13 make choice physical string state. parallel open string, focus states = 1 set | 1, n, 0, n , 1, 0i = 1. |s, n, 0, n , 0, 0i, (39) n = n state |s, n, 0, n , 0, 0i identied string state. is, course, arbitrariness choice, example, reason operator 1. right yet clear. also, choice symmetric left right moving (tilde non-tilde) states. hope clarify issues proceed. show state dened satises two sets equa- tions; one set invoving ls set ls. rst set equations easy derive. starting eqn.(34), following steps last section, one arrives analogues eqns.(26) (27): (l 0 (0) 1) |s, n, 0, n , 0, 0i = 0, l m(0)|s, n, 0, n , 0, 0i = 0, 1. (40) turn attention eqs.(35) (36). particular, eq.(36) im- poses stringent conditions choice string state. take = n = 1 set np = 0 equation: l(0) 1(0)|m = 1, np = 0i = l(0) 1(0)| = 1, np = 0i. (41) non-trivial solution, sides equation must vanish; other- wise, operators l1(0) l1(0) would invertible resulting solution would pure gauge. therefore set l1(0)| 1, np = 0i = (cid:18)l 1(0) l 1 (0)(cid:19) | 1, np = 0i = 0. (42) satisfy condition, write state sum n , | 1, n , np = 0i, | 1, np = 0i = xn =1 14 identify term n = 1 state dened eq.(39). following solution: | 1, np = 0i = xk=0(cid:18)l 1 (0)(cid:19)k 1(0)(cid:17)k (cid:16)l (i 1.)|s, n, 0, n , 0, 0i. (43) note operator l 1 (0) invertible states n 1, therefore term right hand side equation well dened. one reasons presence operator 1 denition state given eq.(39); result, sum equation starts n = 1. next, take n = 1 0 eq.(36): lm(0)|n = 1, np = 0i = l1(0)| = m, np = 0i 0. again, unless sides vanish, candidate string state would pure gauge. must therefore m(0) l (cid:18)l m(0)(cid:19) | 1, np = 0i = 0, 0. project n = 0 sector equation. projec- m(0) contribute > 0, = 0, tion, operator l acting state dened eq.(39), gives one. resulting equations complement eqns.(40): (cid:16)l 0 (0) 1(cid:17) |s, n, 0, n , 0, 0i = 0, l m(0)|s, n, 0, n , 0, 0i = 0, 1. (44) another reason 1 eq.(39) gives correct mass shell condition equation. 3 application formalism developed here, note note duality, left moving(tilde) components multiplied -1, easily implemented transformation form given eq.(6). similarly, hope various dualities implemented gauge transformations type. important point although 3 normalization slope parameter closed string diers factor two conventional one. 15 symmetries usually quite transparent original non-gauge xed form string equations, dicult see gauge xed form equations. 5. interaction term far, considered linearized equations. task section express non-linear interaction term eq.(4) language states. purpose, convenient use coherent state representation states: |f = z du dv fm(u, v) exp x1 exp iu0.x + iv0.p + x1 1 k mm!

(47) far, considered open string. however, straightforward generalize everything done closed string simply doubling number operators. 16 seen virasoro algebra naturally gives rise in- teraction term. next question whether agrees standard string interaction. seems quite plausible standard string interac- tion provide least one particular solution equations, since highly unlikely standard string theory eliminated imposing virasoro invariance. course, existence additional solutions cannot priori ruled out. one way attack problem gauge x light cone gauge compute interaction term gauge. hope return problem future. 6. brst formulation elegant convenient way handling theory invariant gauge symmetry brst method, extensively used various formulations string theory . here, rst show reformulate linear equations open string (eq.(16)) nilpotency condition brst operator, generalize include interaction term. standard brst operator free virasoro algebra given by, q = x l(0) cm 1 2 x (m n)cmcnbm+n, (48) l(0) tion relations: given eq.(2), bs cs satisfy usual anticommuta- know q nilpotent critical dimension: {cm, bn} = m,n. q2 = 0. next, wish determine form q state representation. done directly essentially going steps led eq.(14). present case, start normal ordered operator products con- structed bs cs addition s, represent opera- tors states section (2). this, introduce operators before, also need two sets addditional anticommuting opera- tors, bm cm, partners bs cs. next compute anticommutator q operator product. anticommutator induces mapping initial set states set states represent- ing anticommutator, provides state representation q. 17 procedure, although straightforward, gives complicated unwieldy result . instead, try guess simple economical form q, afterwards check equation q|si = 0 (49) correctly reproduces eq.(16). guess state representation q following: keep eq.(48) stands, l(0) eq.(2) replaced eq.(14). also, choice vacuum dierent usual one. standard vacuum dened annihilated cm bm 1. instead, vacuum satisfy bm|0i = 0, m, conditions. particular, none cs annihilate vacuum. important check whether nilpotency condition q2 = 0 satised. generically, condition violated central charge virasoro algebra. critical dimension, central charge virasoro generators matter elds cancel central charge virasoro generators ghost elds. present case, generators matter elds, given eq.(14), zero central charge. hand, easy verify that, new denition vacuum, virasoro generators ghost sector also central charge, nilpotency condition still satised. briey discuss equation (49). ghost number zero, solutions equation; particular, vacuum solution. ghost number 1, state |si = ck|ki, x (50) solution states |ki satisfy eq.(16). usual, gauge transformations (18) generated brst transformations |si |si + q|gi, 18 |gi ghost number zero. easy incorporate interaction term; identifying states |ki eq.(50) coherent states eq.(45), dene star product two states |si |si |si x ck|fki, equations interaction(eq.(47)) written |si |si = x ck cl |fki |f l i. q|si + |si |si = 0.
