we discuss the formulation of the cghs model in terms of a topological bf theory coupled to particles carrying

non-abelian charge.

in order to have a better understanding of the
quantum properties of four-dimensional gravity
theories two-dimensional models have been exten-
sively studied. a particular model where black
holes can be formed and quantization can be per-
formed is the callan, giddings, harvey and stro-
minger (cghs) model [1]. it is described by the
action

s = z d2xg[e2( r  4g   )

+

gfifi],

(1)

where r is the curvature scalar build with the
metric g ,  is the dilaton,  is the cosmological
constant and fi is a set of scalar matter elds.
if the conformal transformation g = e2g is
performed the action (1) takes the form

s = z d2xg (r  +

2 xi

gfifi),(2)

where  = e2 and r is the scalar curvature
built with the metric g. now the eld equa-
tion for  implies that r = 0 so that the two-
dimensional space-time is locally at and there is
no black hole solution. while the model described
by (1) presents hawking radiation the model de-
scribed by (2) has no hawking radiation. it has
been argued that with proper care of the confor-
mal transformation no ambiguity exists [2]. even
so the quantization in either form is not free of
troubles [3].

talk presented at qg99 meeting, sardinia, september
1999. this work is partially supported by cnpq.

an important feature of the action (2) is that it
can be cast as a topological gauge theory of the
bf type with a gauge group which is a central
extension of the two-dimensional poincare group
[4].
if matter is coupled in this formulation it
should be coupled in a gauge invariant way. a
possibility makes use of a formulation of relativis-
tic particles which carry non-abelian charges [5].
it was applied to the gauge theoretic version of
dilatonic gravity [6]. an important aspect is that
the curvature equation r = 0 never acquires a
source term. we will show that in the formula-
tion where particles carry non-abelian charge a
new gauge invariant coupling does exist for topo-
logical bf theories. this new coupling provides a
source term for the curvature equation and black
hole solutions can then be found [7].

particles carrying non-abelian degrees of free-
dom were originally introduced in the context of
qcd [8,5]. they are described by the group ele-
ment g( ) and a real constant element of the al-
gebra k,  being the proper time of the particle.
it is useful to introduce the variable

q( ) = g( )kg1( ),

(3)

which is in the adjoint representation. as usual
a covariant derivative can be introduced

d =

d
d

+ e xa(x( )).

(4)

if we also consider a kinetic term for the rela-
tivistic particle then an action which is gauge and
reparametrization invariant is [5]

s = mz d  x2+z d t r(kg1( )d g( )).(5)

2

this action is also invariant under the transfor-
mation k  sks1 where s is  independent.
this shows that the action (5) is independent of
the direction in the internal symmetry space given
by k. varying the action (5) with respect to
x( ) we get a non-abelian version of the lorentz
force

mx + 

 x x = et r(f 

q) x ,

(6)

while varying with respect to g( ) we get a co-
variant conservation equation for the non-abelian
charge q

dq
d

+ [a(x( )), q( )] x( ) = 0.

(7)

these equations are known as the wong equa-
tions [8].

consider now a two-dimensional bf topologi-

cal eld theory

s = z d2x t r( f ),

and proper time reparametrization

(10)

e( ) =

d
d  e( ),

x( ) =

d
d  x( ),

(11)

with all remaining elds being reparametrization
scalars.

the new coupling now implies that the con-
nection is no longer at and has as source the
non-abelian charge q

 f = gz d e( ) q( ) 2(x  x( )).

(12)

this will allows us to nd black hole solutions [7].
the eld equation for the lagrange multiplier is

 d = ez d q( ) 2(x  x( )) x( ),

(13)

(8)

where f = da+a2 is the curvature two-form cor-
responding to the connection one-form a and 
is a zero-form transforming in the co-adjoint rep-
resentation of the gauge group. since the struc-
ture of the bf theory requires two elds then,
besides the coupling involving the gauge eld a,
we can consider another coupling involving the
lagrange multiplier . a coupling of the type
t r( q) is gauge invariant but not proper time
reparametrization invariant.
in order to get a
reparametrization invariant action we introduce
the worldline einbein e( ) and the respective mass
term for the particle. so we can consider an ex-
tension of the former actions to

s = z d2x t r( f ) +z d t r(g1k g)
+ ez d2xz d t r(q( )a(x)) 2(x  x( )) x
+ gz d2xz d e( ) t r(q( )) 2(x  x( ))

+

where e and g are independent coupling con-
stants. the action (9) is invariant under gauge

while the equation for non-abelian charge is mod-
ied to

dq
d

+e[a(x( )), q] x+g[(x( )), q]e( ) = 0,(14)

generalizing the conservation equation (7) to the
bf theory. the eld equation obtained by vary-
ing the worldline einbein is

gz d2x t r(q( )(x)) 2(xx( ))+

m2 = 0.(15)

for the two dimensional dilatonic gravity the-
ory we choose the gauge group as the central ex-
tension of the poincare group [4]

[pa, pb] = abz,
[pa, z] = [j, z] = 0,

[j, pa] = a

bpb,

(16)

where pa is the translation generator, j is the
lorentz transformation generator and z is a cen-
tral element of the group. the supersymmetric
extension of (16) was performed in [9]. when we
consider the algebra (16) we can expand the one
form gauge potential in terms of the generators
of the algebra

a = eapa + wj + az.

(17)

m2 = 0.

(30)

the elds ea, w and a are going to be identied
with the zweibein, the spin connection and an
abelian gauge eld, respectively. the lagrange
multiplier  can be expanded as

 = apa + 3j + 2z,

(18)

with components a, 2 and 3 with 2 being pro-
portional to the dilaton in (2). then the curva-
ture two-form f has components

f a(p ) = dea + web a
b ,

f (j) = d,

f (z) = da +

similarly the non-abelian charge q can be ex-
panded as

q = qapa + q3j + q2z.

(20)

the eld equations for the gauge elds (12) are

 (ea

+ gz d e( ) qa( ) 2(x  x( )) = 0,

finally the equation of motion (15) gives a con-
straint among the non-abelian charge, the la-
grange multiplier on the worldline and the parti-
cle mass

gz d2x (qaa + q32 + q23)2(x  x( ))

we will discuss some solutions of the above
equations.
in order to solve (21-30) we have
to perform several gauge xings. we also have
to choose a space-time trajectory for the parti-
cle. we will look for static solutions so we use
rindler like coordinates (x, t). for simplicity let
us consider the proper time gauge for the particle
e( ) = 1 and set the particle at rest in the origin
x( ) = 0, t( ) =  .

0 = e0

let us consider rst the gauge eld sector. in
the gravitational sector we will choose a diagonal
zweibein e1
1 = 0 with the non vanishing com-
ponents satisfying e0
1)1, and a vanishing
space component of the connection 1 = 0. for
the abelian gauge eld we will choose the axial
gauge a1 = 0. eqs.(21-23) reduce to
1e0

0 = (e1

0 + 0e1

1 = gq0 (x),
0 = gq1(x),
10 = gq3 (x),
1 = gq2 (x).

if no matter is present (e = g = 0) then we nd
at space-time as the only solution. now consider
the situation when matter is present. if q3 = 0
and qa 6= 0 then the space-time has torsion but
if q3 6= 0 and qa = 0 then the
no curvature.
space-time has curvature but no torsion. let us
consider the last case. take q2 and q3 as con-
stants (as we shall see below q2 and q3 constants
and qa = 0 is a solution of (27-29) ). then we
nd as solution of (31-34)

0 = gq3(x),
a0 = x + gq2(x) + a,

0 = (b  2gq3|x|)
e0

where b and a are integration constants. the
space-time described by (35) has a black hole
and the curvature scalar is given by (33) r =
gq3(x). notice that gq3 can now be understood
as the black hole mass and it is essential to have
g 6= 0.
choices reduce eqs.(24-26) to
1 = eq0(x),

for the lagrange multiplier sector the gauge

10  3e1
11 = eq1(x),
01 = 00 + 3e0
12  e1
e0
01 = 0,
13 = eq3(x).

0 = 0,
10 = eq2(x),

in the presence of matter with q2 and q3 con-
stants and qa = 0 we nd, using (35)

(36)

+ q2( )3(, 0)] +

m2 = 0.

(39)

in the presence of matter with qa = 0 (39) is ill
dened since according to (37) 2 and 3 have a
discontinuity at x = 0. we then take q2 = 0 and
(39) becomes gq3c + 1
2 m2 = 0 giving a constraint
among the integration constants q3 and c and
the mass m. recalling that the curvature scalar
is r = gq3(x) we can interpret the black hole
mass as being due to the non-abelian charge of
the particle q3 or to its mass m.

some local solutions for the gauge theoretic
version of dilatonic gravity theories with non-
abelian sources have been presented. presently
we are investigating the constraint structure of
the model and its hamiltonian formulation. we
also plan to study global aspects of the model.

3 = eq3(x),(37)
where c is another integration constant and (x)
is the step function. the appearance of the step
function in the solution for the lagrange multi-
plier elds signals that there are topological re-
strictions to the motion of particles. it is remark-
able that the would be cosmological constant 3
is now a step function changing sign at the posi-
tion of the particle. the dilaton 2 still has its
linear term but has also acquired a step function.
we can however set q2 = 0 and still have a linear
dilaton and the black hole (35), which is indepen-
dent of q2.

for the non-abelian charge the equations (27-

29), after the gauge choice, reduce to

q0  eq10  g(q13  q31) = 0,
q1  e(q00  q2e0
q2  eq1e0
q3 = 0.

0 + g(q01  q10) = 0,

0)  g(q03  q30) = 0,

(38)
in the presence of matter with qa = 0 and q2 and
q3 constants we nd using (35) and (37) that q2
and q3 are constants as we had anticipated.

finally the constraint equation (30) becomes,

after the gauge choices,

g[qa( )a(, 0) + q3( )2(, 0)
