(2.1) given by: p = 1 + g 2 . (2.4) 1 + (1)f 2 (1)f reverses sign world-sheet fermions, whereas g reverses sign world-sheet scalar fermions associated x6, . . . , x9 coordinates. computing partition function (2.1) also need know (1)f g act fock vacuum dierent sectors; known . ns sector 1 : : (1)f = 1 (1)f = 1 g = 1 g = 1 . (2.5) thus combine open string spectrum two sectors, see net (1)f g projection, given mass level open string states carrying (1)f charges g charges. however, net (1)f g projection, since fock vacuum sectors odd (1)f g, hence open string states, obtained oscillators carrying net (1)f g charge 1 acting vacuum, 7 allowed spectrum. thus combined contribution chan paton factors (2.1) ns sector states written z dt 2t trn e2tho 1 + (1)f g 2 ! , (2.6) tr denotes sum oscillators single fock space, integration momenta non-compact directions, sum winding numbers compact directions, contain sum dierent chan paton factors. situation ramond sector even simpler. ground state 16-fold de- generate due 8 fermionic zero modes, contains equal number states charge 1 1 three operators (1)f , g (1)f g. thus rr(e2tho(1)f ), rr(e2thog), rr(e2tho(1)f g) vanish, com- bine spectrum two chan paton sectors, contribution (2.1) written z dt 2t 1 2 trr(e2tho) .

(2.15) (2.18), (2.14) becomes z = 0 . (2.17) (2.18) (2.19) since integrand z vanishes t, shows exact degeneracy bosonic fermionic open string states mass level, although brane non-bps. order nd bosonic fermionic spectrum separately, need evaluate (2.12) sum (2.8) (2.11). given by: (2)p+1 (2t) p+1 2 4 f2(q)4f3(q)4 f1(q)4f4(q)4 .
