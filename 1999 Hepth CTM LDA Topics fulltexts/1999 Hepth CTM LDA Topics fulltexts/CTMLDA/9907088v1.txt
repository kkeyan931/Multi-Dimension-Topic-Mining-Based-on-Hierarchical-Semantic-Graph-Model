abstract

multi-trace scalar operators in the (0, k, 0) representations of su(4)r share many proper-
ties with their single-trace analogs. these multi-trace operators are primary elds of short
representations of the n = 4 superconformal group. thus, they have protected dimensions.
we show that two- and three-point correlator functions of such operators do not receive
radiative corrections at order g2 in perturbation theory for an arbitrary gauge group.

1 introduction

short representations of n = 4 superconformal algebra play an important role in the cor-
respondence between supersymmetric yang-mills (sym) theory and supergravity in anti-de
sitter (ads) space [13]. operators in the short representations have protected dimensions,
while the dimensions of the long representations depend on the coupling constant. short op-
erators with a single trace over the gauge indices are believed to correspond to single-particle
states of supergravity in the ads background. multi-trace operators relate to multi-particle
states. the long operators with single traces correspond to string states.

much work has been devoted to the investigations of correlator functions using either
the supergravity dual [25] or directly computing in perturbation theory in sym [69]. for
additional references see the review article [10]. since the supergravity calculations are
applicable for large values of the t hooft coupling, they cannot be easily compared with the
weak-coupling perturbation theory. therefore, it is interesting to study non-renormalized
quantities.
if a free-eld value of some quantity coincides with its large-coupling value
obtained by supergravity calculations, then such a result can be regarded as a hint for a
non-renormalization theorem. for example, two- and three-point functions of single-trace
short operators were found to be equal to their free-eld values [5]. by checking if such
non-renormalization theorems hold at low orders of perturbation theory one can test the
conjectured duality. perturbative calculations in eld theory also provide information beyond
the leading order in the 1/n expansion. see refs. [68,11] for calculations of two- and three-
point functions. of course, there should be a symmetry reason for a non-renormalization
theorem to hold to all orders of perturbation theory and even non-perturbatively [1214].

in addition to single-trace short multiplets there are also multi-trace operators in short
representations of the n = 4 superconformal group. this fact is certainly known, but not
widely appreciated. see refs. [15, 16] for recent discussions on multi-trace operators. the
main result of this paper is that two- and three-point functions of such short multi-trace
operators are not renormalized at order g2 in perturbation theory, independent of the gauge
group. multi-trace operators are in short representations whenever they transform in the
same representations of the avor symmetry as the single-trace short operators. that is, a
primary operator proportional to k powers of the scalar eld is short if it transforms in the
k-index traceless symmetric representation of so(6)r, or equivalently in (0, k, 0) of su(4)r.
two facts underline the relevance of short multi-trace operators for the maldacena duality.
first, single- and multi-trace operators have non-vanishing two-point functions already at
the tree level. second, the supergravity dual is blind to the gauge structure of n = 4 sym
theory since only the gauge-invariant operators enter the correspondence.
it is therefore
possible that at sub-leading orders in n, the true correspondence between the single-particle
states of supergravity and the short representations of superconformal n = 4 theory involves

a linear combination of single- and multi-trace operators. after all, such operators have
identical quantum numbers.

we rst review why multi-trace operators in the (0, k, 0) representations of su(4)r are
indeed short and why their dimensions are protected. next, we show that two-point functions
of arbitrary linear combinations of operators in the (0, k, 0), either single- or multiple-trace
are not corrected at order g2 in perturbation theory. our results are an extension of ref. [6],
we show that the techniques developed there are also applicable to multi-trace operators.
we follow the notation of ref. [6], where it was shown that two- and three-point functions
of short single-trace operators are not renormalized at o(g2). afterwards, we repeat the
calculation for a particularly simple case of a three-point function, leaving for the appendix
the proof that arbitrary three-point functions of linear combinations of short operators are
not renormalized at o(g2).

n = 4 supersymmetry has 16 supercharges. thus, a generic multiplet is obtained by
acting on a primary eld with up to 16 supersymmetry transformations. the on-shell trans-
formations are [17]

i
a  = i   i + 
i 
,
l
[ij] + ijklk 
[ij] = 
,
i f() + 
i = 
f() = i d ()i,

j [ik, jk] + j d ij,

(1.1)

where [ij], i, and a  are the scalar, fermion, and gauge components of the n = 4 mul-
tiplet, respectively. f() denotes the gauge eld strength tensor. all these elds transform
in the adjoint representation of the gauge group, but we omitted the gauge index. latin
indices are the fundamental indices of su(4)r, while the greek indices refer to the lorentz
group. parameters 
i and i  all anticommute and denote the action of supercharges qi

and qi .

a primary operator cannot, by denition, be expressed as a supersymmetry transfor-
mation of some other operator. hence, primary operators are products of the scalar elds
[ij], with color indices contracted without the use of the f symbol. any antisymmetric
contraction of gauge indices indicates that the operator contains some descendent because
the supersymmetry transformations (1.1) contain a commutator of scalar elds.

short or chiral multiplets are generated by at most eight supersymmetry transforma-
in the
s (corresponding to

tions of a primary eld, while the remaining transformations annihilate the eld.
notation of eq. (1.1), a short multiplet is generated by at most four qi

i s) and no more than four qi  (i ).

primary gauge-invariant elds k in the (0, k, 0) representation of su(4)r generate short
multiplets. there are several arguments in the literature explaining that fact [1820]. these
arguments do not make any reference to the gauge structure of the primary elds. short

2

multiplets were constructed using the oscillator method, in which the representations of
non-compact groups are built from unitary representations of a compact subgroup [18, 19].
moreover, representations that contain null vectors under the action of supersymmetry
transformations are short [10, 20]. this argument also relies on the global symmetries of the
primary eld, and not its gauge structure.

another way of showing that k in (0, k, 0) are in short multiplets is by considering the
n = 1 superconformal algebra. in the n = 1 language, only su(3)  u(1) subgroup of
su(4) is manifest. scalar elds are in the antisymmetric (6) representation, they decompose
into chiral 32/3 and antichiral 32/3 of su(3)  u(1). the decomposition of k in (0, k, 0)
into su(3)  u(1) involves a k-index symmetric tensor of su(3) carrying the r-charge of
2k
3 . such a eld must be n = 1 chiral since it is a product of k scalar components of chiral
superelds. this means that the original multiplet must be short and that its dimension is
xed by the n = 1 superalgebra to be k.

2 two- and three-point correlators

conformal symmetry uniquely species the form of two- and three-point correlator functions.
anomalous dimensions of operators show up in correlators as logarithmic corrections. such
logarithms arise as the result of expanding exponentials of the anomalous dimensions in
the powers of coupling.
in the case of protected operators, only the overall coecient of
a correlator function can depend on the coupling constant. we will show the absence of
radiative corrections at o(g2) in any formcontaining either logarithms or powers of the
space-time points. this arms that the operators we consider have protected dimensions.

we now show that two-point correlators of arbitrary linear combinations of operators in
the (0, k, 0) representation are not corrected at order g2. we denote the single-trace operators
by

ok = tr(t a1 . . . t ak) a1

i1j1 . . . ak

ikjk

,

while generic multi- or single-trace operators by

m r

k = tr(t a1 . . . t am1 ) . . . tr(t amr +1 . . . t ak) a1

i1j1 . . . ak

ikjk

.

the set of numbers m1, . . . , mr denes the number of generators in each of the r traces. the
k-th trace contains mk  mk1 generators, where m0 = 0. with this denition ok = m 1
k . in
the above formulas, matrices t a are the generators of any simple nonabelian gauge group.
indices a are the adjoint indices. the generators can be in any representation since we will
only use the cyclic property of the trace and the lie algebra relations about commutators.
following ref. [6] we work in the n = 1 component language. we refer to the scalar
components of chiral superelds as zn and the antichiral ones as zn, where n = 1, 2, 3 is the
su(3) index. the calculation we carry out here follows closely that of ref. [6]. we will use

3

the same notation. we denote the propagator of scalar elds by

g(x, y) =

1
42

1

(x  y)2 .

there are two types of interactions that enter the calculation of the two-point function. the
rst interaction is the self-energy correction to the scalar propagator

a

a = aa

c2(g)a(x, y)g(x, y),

(2.1)

where a, a are the gauge indices, and c2(g) is the casimir of the adjoint representation of
the gauge group g. we will not need the explicit form of function a(x, y). second, there are
four-point interactions which come from summing the gluon exchange diagram and quartic
interaction originating from the d-term. the sum of these two diagrams gives

a

a

b

b

+

= (f pabf pab

+ f pab

f pab)b(x, y)g2(x, y),

(2.2)

where, again, the explicit form of b(x, y) is irrelevant.

we always choose the highest-weight state in the k-index symmetric representation of
su(3), in order to avoid complications with the combinatorics of avor symmetry. for a
two-point function this implies that one of the operators is proportional to k powers of z1,
the other to z1. the tree-level expression for the correlator of two, not necessary identical,
operators mk is given by

hm (1)

k (x)m (2)

k (y)i = g(x, y)kp (1,2)
k,k,0,
p (1,2)
k,k,0 = xperms 

[tr(t a1 . . . t am1 ) . . . tr(t amr +1 . . . t ak)]

(2.3)

htr(t a(1) . . . t a(m

1

)) . . . tr(t

a(m

r +1) . . . t a(k))i .

the self-energy graphs are trivial to incorporate: we need to multiply one of the propagators
by c2(g)a(x, y) and then sum over all propagators. this sum is equal to

k c2(g)a(x, y)g(x, y)kp (1,2)
k,k,0.

(2.4)

we now insert the interaction of eq. (2.2) into the tree-level expression (2.3) and sum over
all pairs of lines. the f symbols are converted into commutators on one of the multi-trace
expressions. we do not repeat the whole expression (2.3) with additional commutators
inserted, but instead write only the relevant part

k

xi6=j=1

{tr(t a1 . . . [t ai, t p] . . . t am1 ) . . . tr(. . . [t aj , t p] . . .) . . . tr(t amr +1 . . . t ak )} .

(2.5)

we now use the identity

to observe that

traces

{tr(t a1 . . . [t ai, t p] . . . t am1 ) . . . tr(. . . [t aj , t p] . . .) . . .} = 0.

(2.8)

this is the observation that allows us to extend the results of ref. [6] from single traces to
multiple traces. we will use similar identities repeatedly. the remaining sum in eq. (2.6)
can be performed for each trace individually. we can again use eq. (2.7) to rewrite the sums
within a given trace

ki

tr(. . . [t i, t p] . . . [t j, t p] . . .) =

xi6=j=1
xi=1



ki

tr(. . . [[t i, t p], t p] . . .) = kic2(g)tr(. . .),

(2.9)

where ki is the number of generators in the trace. it is now easy to perform the sum over
each trace, which gives

kb(x, y)g(x, y)kp (1,2)
k,k,0,

(2.10)

where the extra factor of 1/2 is a combinatoric factor that prevents overcounting of diagrams.
the additional minus sign comes from converting two f symbols into commutators. it is
now apparent that the cancellation of radiative corrections happens for the same reason it
does in the two-point function of single traces. it was shown in ref. [6] that 2a + b = 0
due to a non-renormalization theorem for ho2o2i, which is a consequence of o2 being in the
multiplet containing the energy-momentum tensor.

similarly, we can repeat the analysis for the hmk(x)m 

k(y)o2(w)i correlator. calculation
in addition to
for the general three-point functions will be presented in the appendix.
o(g2) interactions of eqs. (2.1) and (2.2) there is a four-scalar interaction involving three

where the form of function c will not be important for the calculation. in some cases only
the d-term quartic interaction contributes in the above diagram dening c. whenever both
f - and d-terms contribute, we denote the corresponding function by c .

the tree-level expression for this correlator is

k,k,2t11,

k,k,2 = kp (1,2)
k,k,2,

(2.12)

where tij is an su(3) avor matrix. this matrix enters our denition of o2 = zitijzj. in
the above equation m (1)
k = (z1)k. the additional factor of k comes from
distinguishing one line in each multi-trace expression. it is straightforward to sum all possible
self-energy diagrams since they multiply each propagator by the same expression. the sum
is proportional to the tree-level term, which we omit, times the following factor

k = (z1)k and m (2)

c2(g) [(k  1)a(x, y) + a(x, w) + a(y, w)] .

(2.13)

k (x) and m (2)

next, we include quartic interactions (2.2) by summing over all pairs of k  1 propagators
that connect the operators m (1)
k (y). repeating the same steps we have already
explained for the two-point function, we convert the f symbols into commutators and then
perform the sum over pairs of indices. since there is only one distinguished generator in
the traces at points x and y, eq. (2.8) still holds. the distinguished generator is the one
connected by a propagator to the operator o2. one can always use the identity (2.7) for a
trace that does not contain the distinguished line. the remaining sum in eq. (2.6) is easy to
carry out. for the traces without the distinguished generator we pick a factor of ki, which
is the negative of the number of elements in a given trace, just like we did in eq. (2.9). for
the trace with the distinguished generator, the algebra is slightly more involved. we can
always use the cyclic property of the trace to place the special generator as the last one in
the trace. then, we use the following identity

ki1

tr(. . . [t ai, t p] . . . [t aj , t p] . . .)

xi6=j=1
xi=1

ki1

= 

{tr(. . . [[t ai, t p], t p] . . .) + tr(. . . [t ai, t p] . . . [t aki , t p])}

= (ki  1  1)c2(g)tr(. . .)

(2.14)

to complete the evaluation of the sum over pairs of propagators between the two operators
mks. there are k  1 such propagators. due to the additional 1 in eq. (2.14) the nal
expression is proportional to k  2.

there are three possible ways of inserting interaction (2.11) into the tree-level expression,
depending on which vertex the two lines grouped together enter. this distinguished vertex in

6

eq. (2.11) corresponds to the space-time point x. when the distinguished vertex is one of the
vertices corresponding to operators m (1)
k (y), we need to sum over all propagators
connecting these vertices. this single sum is easy to perform using the identity (2.7) since
the sum over all, but one, traces vanishes. the selected trace is the one which involves a
generator linked to the operator o2(w) by the scalar propagator. the algebra is identical to
the one we used in the previous equation, which is

k (x) or m (2)

ki1

xi=1

tr(. . . [t ai, t p] . . . [t aki , t p]) = c2(g)tr(t a1 . . . t aki ).

(2.15)

when eq. (2.11) is inserted with the distinguished vertex corresponding to the operator
o2(w) there is no need to perform any sums since there are only two propagators entering
this vertex. however, the choice of avors at this vertex is such that both the d-term and
f -term vertices contribute in this case. thus, the expression is proportional to c (w; x, y)
instead of c. the sum of all o(g2) contributions is equal to the born term times

c2(g)

[(k  1)a(x, y) + a(x, w) + a(y, w) +

2
2c(x; y, w) + 2c(y; x, w) + 2c (w; x, y)].

k  2

b(x, y) +

(2.16)

the minus sign in front of functions c compared to eq. (2.15) is the result of converting
f symbols into commutators. the factor of two comes from two pairs of f symbols in the
denition (2.11) of function c. eq. (2.16) is equal to zero as a result of non-renormalization
of the ho2(x)o2(y)o2(w)i correlator, which implies that [6]

a(x, y) + a(x, w) + a(y, w) + 2[c(x; y, w) + c(y; x, w) + c (w; x, y)] = 0.

(2.17)

this equation together with the fact that 2a + b = 0 imply the lack of o(g2) corrections
k(y)o2(w)i correlator. in the appendix, we show that o(g2) corrections for
to the hmk(x)m 
general three-point functions hmk1mk2mk3i vanish.

3 conclusions

we investigated correlators of primary elds of short multi-trace operators in n = 4 super-
symmetry. such primary elds contain k scalar elds in the (0, k, 0) representation of su(4)r
and arbitrary symmetric contraction of color indices. we have shown that two- and three-
point functions of chiral primary elds do not receive radiative corrections at order g2 in
perturbation theory. this result is valid for any gauge group due to the non-renormalization
theorem for two- and three-point correlators of the so-called massless multiplet, which
includes the energy-momentum tensor. the result is also independent of the the size of the
gauge group, so it is not a leading n result in the large-n expansion.

7

our results suggest that two- and three-point correlators of arbitrary short multiplets
are not renormalized.
if these results hold beyond low orders in perturbation theory, it
indicates that there must be a symmetry reason for such non-renormalization. the so-
called bonus u(1)y symmetry [12] explains why correlators of operators which correspond
to single-particle states of supergravity on ads spaces are not renormalized. perhaps it is
possible to extend the arguments about the u(1)y symmetry to correlators of short operators
corresponding to multi-particle states. since all the quantum numbers of the single- and
multi-trace chiral primary operators are identical, non-renormalization theorems are likely
to be a consequence of the full n = 4 superconformal symmetry. superconformal ward
identities would not distinguish between single-trace and multi-trace operators.

it would be interesting to explore the implications of these results for the duality between
supergravity and conformal eld theory. one of the issues that require better understanding
is the correspondence between operators in the conformal eld theory and supergravity
states. it is believed that single-particle states of supergravity correspond to short single-
trace operators. however, the single- and multi-trace operators mix.
it is easy to check
that at the tree-level, the two-point functions hokmki do not vanish. in the su(n) theory,
two-point functions of single-trace operators ok are proportional to n k in the leading order
in n. likewise, in the leading order hokm r
k i  n kr+1, where r is the number of color
traces in the operator m r
k . thus, the mixing of operators ok with mks is suppressed in the
large-n limit.

appendix hmk1mk2mk3i

we now extend the calculations of section 2. we show that arbitrary three-point corre-
lators hmk1(x)mk2(y)mk3(w)i are not corrected at order g2. we dene the sum over all
permutations of indices in a given multi-trace expression as

mki  tr(t a1 . . . t aki ) 

1

ki! xperms 

tr(t a(1) . . . t a(m1)) . . . tr(t a(mr +1) . . . t a(ki)), (a.1)

where the number of traces and the number of generators in each trace depends on the gauge
structure of a particular operator. the number of propagators in the tree-level expression

8

that connect operators with k1 and k2 elds are 3 = (k1 + k2  k3)/2 and so on. as in
the previous sections, mk1  (z1)k1 is n = 1 chiral and it is the highest-weight eld of
the completely symmetric su(3) representation. similarly, mk2  (z1)k2 is antichiral, while
mk3  (z1)1(z1)2.

with the above denitions, the tree-level expression for the correlator is

hmk1(x)mk2(y)mk3(w)i  g(x, y)3g(x, w)2g(y, w)1pk1,k2,k3,

pk1,k2,k3 = tr(t a1 . . . t a3 t b1 . . . t b2 ) tr(t b1 . . . t b2 t c1 . . . t c1 )

tr(t c1 . . . t c1 t a1 . . . t a3 ).

(a.2)

in the above formula we omitted the su(3) avor generator, which contracts the avor
indices of chiral and antichiral elds in mk3(w). the computation of radiative corrections
is very similar to the one we presented for the hmkm 
ko2i correlator, only the algebra of
traces is more complicated. there are three types of diagrams that contribute to the o(g2)
corrections. these correspond to insertions of o(g2) interactions of eqs. (2.1), (2.2), and
(2.11) into the tree-level expression for the correlator.

the self-energy graphs are straightforward to incorporate. they give a factor of c2(g)a

for every propagator, so we get

c2(g) [3a(x, y) + 2a(x, w) + 1a(y, w)]

(a.3)

times the born expression. next, we include the interactions of eq. (2.11). for each of the
three vertices we need to evaluate

tr(t a1 . . . [t ai, t p] . . . t a3 t b1 . . . [t bi, t p] . . . t b3 ) tr(. . .) tr(. . .).

(a.4)
however, it turns out that all three such expressions are identical. we can do the algebra
for a xed, yet suciently general, permutation of the generators. performing the sums over
all permutations will not aect the result. we divide the traces in the multi-trace expression
tr(t a1 . . . t b3 ) into three categories: traces containing only generators with index a, only
index b, and containing both indices. for simplicity, we choose the permutations of indices
such that for traces with two dierent indices, the generators with index a come before the
ones with index b. for example,

tr(t a . . . t a) . . . tr(t a . . . t a)tr(t a . . . t at b . . . t b) . . . tr(t a . . . t at b . . . t b)
tr(t b . . . t b) . . . tr(t b . . . t b).

(a.5)

we choose analogous permutations for the other two traces. when performing the sums
j=1 in eq. (a.5), we can neglect all traces with one kind of indices only. sums
over these traces vanish due to eq. (2.7). our goal is to show that we can move the sums

p3
i=1 and p2

9

from one multi-trace expression to another. converting the commutators into the f symbols
and then back into commutators on another trace, we get

wk1,k2,k3 = tr(t a1 . . . t b3 )

tr(t c1 . . . t c1 t a1 . . . [t ai, t p] . . . t a3 ).

(a.6)

within a given multi-trace expression we can convert a sum over one kind of index into
minus the sum over another index

because we can use eq. (2.7) within each trace independently. in eq. (a.6) we can exchange
the sum over bs into the sum over cs using the above trick. we can then move the sum over
cs into the last trace in eq. (a.6) by converting f symbols into traces. this shows that the
expression dened in eq. (a.4) is universal for all insertions of interactions (2.11), hence we
obtain

 2wk1,k2,k3 [c(x; y, w) + c(y; x, w) + c (w; x, y)] .

(a.8)

the overall factor of 2 is the result of converting two pairs of f symbols into propagators.
this is the same factor as the one appearing in eq. (2.16).

the nal step is evaluating the contributions of interactions of eq. (2.2). for each set of

indices a, b, and c, we need to compute the double sum
