abstract. we discuss the relevance of eisenstein series for representing certain
g(z)-invariant string theory amplitudes which receive corrections from bps states
only. the eisenstein series are constructed using g(z)-invariant mass formulae and
are manifestly invariant modular functions on the symmetric space k\g(r) of non-
compact type, with k the maximal compact subgroup of g(r).
in particular, we
show how eisenstein series of the t-duality group so(d, d, z) can be used to represent
one- and g-loop amplitudes in compactied string theory. we also obtain their
non-perturbative extensions in terms of the eisenstein series of the u-duality group
ed+1(d+1)(z).

1. introduction

worldsheet modular invariance has played a major role in the construction of consistent
anomaly-free perturbative string models. at the one-loop level, it demands that the
string partition function be invariant under the sl(2, z) fractional linear transformations
of the modular parameter of world-sheet torus. the advent of target-space and non-
perturbative dualities has brought into play yet another branch of the mathematics of
automorphic forms invariant under innite discrete groups g(z). these dualities arise
in models with many supersymmetries, where the scalar elds take values in a rigid
symmetric space k\g(r), where k is the maximal compact subgroup of g. duality
symmetries identify points in k\g(r) diering by the right action of an innite discrete
subgroup g(z) of g(r), and all physical amplitudes are constrained to be invariant
under the transformations in g(z). this includes in particular the mapping class group
sl(d, z) in the case of toroidal compactications of dieomorphism-invariant theories,
the t-duality group so(d, d, z) in toroidal compactications of string theories, as well
as the non-perturbative u-duality group ed+1(d+1)(z) in maximally supersymmetric
compactied m-theory or non-perturbative type ii string theory [1, 2, 3] (see for instance
[4, 5] for reviews and exhaustive list of references). these duality symmetries are to be
contrasted with dualities between distinct string theories, which, although less tied to
supersymmetry, yield much weaker constraints.

the invariance under duality symmetries, although valid for all physical amplitudes,
is usually not sucient to completely determine them. for a certain class of bps
saturated amplitudes however, supersymmetry gives further constraints, in the form of
second order dierential equations in the most favorable half-bps saturated case [6, 7, 8].
combining these constraints with duality invariance and behavior at the boundary of
the moduli space allows in many cases to determine exact non-perturbative results
not obtainable otherwise, which can then be analyzed at weak coupling to provide
interesting insights on instanton calculus in string theory [13, 14, 15] (see also ref. [16]
for lecture notes). as an illustration, table 1 lists for a number of compactications the
(non-)perturbative symmetries that apply to all amplitudes along with the amount of
supersymmetry of the theory and a selection of 1/2 and 1/4-bps amplitudes.

the prototypical example of such an exactly computable coupling is the r4 coupling
in ten dimensional type iib theory. this was conjectured [13] and later proved [17, 6, 8]
to be a certain (non-holomorphic) automorphic form of weight 0 of the s-duality group
sl(2, z), namely the eisenstein series of order 3/2

tree-level and one-loop terms, along with an innite series of exponentially suppressed
terms of order en/gs, attributed to n d-instanton congurations. it is easy to check
that the above eisenstein series is an eigenmode of the laplacian on the upper half

supersymmetry on the other hand requires the exact r4 coupling to be an eigenmode of
the same laplacian with the precise eigenvalue 3/8, which together with the assumption
of at most polynomial growth at weak coupling uniquely selects the eisenstein series of
order 3/2.

in this talk we discuss the construction and utility of automorphic forms of the
duality groups g(z) generalizing the eisenstein series of sl(2, z) (see ref.
[15] for an
extensive treatment). for the representation theory of these groups, in particular the
multiplets of half-bps states that we will use, we refer the reader to the review [5] and
its very brief summary [18]. section 2 presents the general construction of eisenstein
series, section 3 its applications to perturbative string amplitudes; section 4 extends
these results to the full non-perturbative expression and nally section 5 mentions some
open directions.

2. generalized eisenstein series

we focus on string or m-theory models whose moduli space is spanned by a symmetric
space of non-compact type

k\g(r)

, g(r) = k  a  n ,

(4)

where k is the maximal compact subgroup of g(r) and we have also indicated the
iwasawa decomposition of g(r) into elements of the maximal compact, abelian and
nilpotent subgroups k, a, n respectively. this structure may describe only a part of

eisenstein series in string theory

4

the moduli space, like the internal metric for toroidal compactications or the neveu-
schwarz moduli for perturbative strings, or the full moduli space when protected by
supersymmetry. duality symmetries identify dierent points in this moduli space and
form an innite discrete group g(z) of the classical symmetry group g(r), acting from
the right on the coset k\g(r). the bps states are labelled by a set of integer charges
m and fall into certain representations r of the duality group. the mass of half-bps
states is given by the manifestly g(z)-invariant form

m2(r) = m  mr(g)  m .

here, the moduli matrix mr in representation r is given by

(5)

mr(g) = rtr(g)

(6)
where g denotes an element in the coset k\g(r). moreover, there is in general a
half-bps constraint, quadratic in the charges, that can be written schematically as

g  a  n ,

,

1/2-bps :

to be more specic,

k = m  m = 0 ,

(7)
where the cup product m m denotes all but the highest of the irreducible components
of the symmetric tensor product rsr. the constraint thus amounts to requiring that
r s r be an irreducible representation.

in the case of the sl(n, z) duality groups (of toroidally
compactied dieomorphism invariant theories) we will be mostly interested in the
fundamental and antifundamental representations, labelled by the charges mi and mi
respectively.
in this case the moduli matrix m in (6) is simply the (inverse) metric
gij (gij) on the torus. for the t-duality group of toroidally compactied string theory
we will need the vector, spinor and conjugate spinor representations, while for the u-
duality group of m-theory the particle, string and membrane representations will be of
relevance (see [5, 18, 15] for details).

given the duality group g(z), one may follow the denition of eisenstein series

given in the mathematical literature by [19]

r

e g(z)
{wi} (g) = xhg(z)/n

yi=1

ai(gh)wi ,

(8)

where wi is now an arbitrary r-dimensional vector (r = rank g) in weight space, and
a(g) is the abelian component of g in the iwasawa decomposition (4). note that this
denition is manifestly k-invariant on the left and g(z)-invariant on the right. this
denition is however hardly tractable, and we rather dene our generalized eisenstein
series [14, 15] as

e g(z)
r;s (g) = xmr\{0}

(m  m) (cid:2)m  rtr(g)  m(cid:3)s

(9)

for any symmetric space k\g(r), any representation r of g and any order s. this
denition, albeit less general than (8), has a more transparent physical meaning: the
 choosing w along a highest-weight vector r associated to a representation r reduces (8) to (9)
where w = sr, up to an s-dependent factor. these two denitions generalize the two terms of the
last equality in (2) to higher rank groups.

eisenstein series in string theory

5

lattice r labels the set of bps states in the representation r of the duality group,
m2 = m  rtr(g)  m gives their mass squared (or tension), and the -function imposes
the half-bps condition (7). this ensures that the sum runs over one g(z) orbit only,
and is in fact a necessary requirement for the eisenstein series to be an eigenmode of the
laplacian on the symmetric space. the eigenvalue follows simply from group theory,

k\g e g(z)

r;s = s(,   s) e g(z)
r;s ,

(10)

where  is the highest weight of the representation and  is the weyl vector [15].
this expression implies in particular that eisenstein series associated to representations
related by outer automorphisms, i.e. symmetries of the dynkin diagram, are degenerate
under k\g, as well as two eisenstein series of same representation but order s and the
dual value [(, )/(, )]  s. up to these identications, we expect that, aside from
cusp forms, a basis of invariant functions on the space is spanned by the representations
corresponding to the nodes of the dynkin diagram.

3. perturbative string amplitudes

3.1. one-loop modular integral

under toroidal compactication on a torus t d, any string theory exhibits the t-duality
symmetry so(d, d, z), and all amplitudes should be expressible in terms of modular
forms of this group. for half-bps saturated couplings, the one-loop amplitude often
reduces to an integral of a lattice partition function over the fundamental domain f of
the moduli space of genus-1 riemann surfaces,

id = 2zf

d2
 2
2

zd,d(g, b;  ) ,

(11)

where zd,d is the partition function (or theta function) of the even self-dual lattice
describing the toroidal compactication. this is for instance the case for r4 couplings
in type ii strings on t d, or r2 or f 2 couplings in type ii on k3  t 2.

it is natural to expect a connection between this one-loop modular integral and
the so(d, d, z) eisenstein series dened above. as is well known, the  -integral can be
carried out by the method of orbits, which corresponds to a large volume expansion of
the integral. this yields [14, 20]

id =

22
3

vd + 2vd e sl(d,z)

d;s=1 + . . .

(12)

and exhibits the order 1 sl(d, z) eisenstein series in the fundamental representation.
the omitted terms are exponentially suppressed world-sheet instanton terms that can
be written down exactly and simplify for the low-dimensional cases, reducing to the
standard results:

i1 =

22

3 (cid:18)r +

1

r(cid:19) ,

i2 = 2 log(cid:0)t2u2|(t )(u)|4(cid:1) .

(13)

eisenstein series in string theory

6

treating these simple cases rst, it is not dicult to show that they can be rewritten
as the sum of the so(d, d, z) eisenstein series of order 1 in the spinor and conjugate
spinor representations:

id = 2 e so(d,d,z)

s;s=1

+ 2 e so(d,d,z)

c;s=1

,

d = 1, 2 .

(14)

in particular, the result is manifestly invariant under the extended t-duality o(d, d, z),
where the extra generator exchanges the two spinors.

to arrive at a similar claim for d > 2, one considers the eigenvalues of the
one-loop integral under both the laplacian so(d,d) on the moduli space so(d) 
so(d)\so(d, d, r), as well as under another second order dierential operator (cid:3)d. this
operator is given by

(cid:3)d = gl(d) 

1

8 (cid:18)gij



gij(cid:19)2

= sl(d) +

8d (cid:18)gij
2  d



gij(cid:19)2

(15)

which is non-invariant under so(d, d), but still invariant under complete t-duality on
all directions, and happens to have id as an eigenvector . the resulting eigenvalues are
[15]

so(d,d)id =

d(2  d)

4

id

, (cid:3)did =

d(2  d)

id .

(16)

on the other hand, the corresponding eigenvalues under these operators of the eisenstein
series in the vector, spinor and conjugate spinor representation are given by,
sd(s  d + 1)

(s, s) = (c, s) =

(17)

(v, s) = s(s  d + 1) ,

(18)

(19)

(20)

comparing (16) with (17)-(20), we see that the candidate eisenstein series for the
one-loop integral are restricted to the order s = 1 spinor and conjugate spinor series,
together with the order s = d/2  1 vector series and their duals. another constraint
comes from comparison of the large volume expansion (12) with the expansion of the
eisenstein series. these two requirements then enable one to show that the one-loop
integral id in (11) can be represented for d  3 as

id = 2

( d

v;s= d

2 1

= 2 e so(d,d,z)

s;s=1

= 2 e so(d,d,z)

c;s=1

.

(21)

here, the rst equality is a theorem and the last two are well-supported conjectures [15].
as a practical application of this result, let us consider the conjectured duality
between heterotic string on t 4 and type iia on k3. on the heterotic side, the half-bps
states are momentum and winding states, and transform as a vector of so(4, 20, z).
on the type iia side at the t 4/z2 orbifold point, these states correspond instead to

eisenstein series in string theory

7

even branes wrapped on invariant cycles of t 4, plus fractional branes stuck at the
xed points of the orbifolds. restricting to a [so(4)  so(4)]\so(4, 4) subspace of
the moduli space, it is easy to see that under duality, the vector of so(4, 4) should
be mapped to the conjugate spinor: the duality therefore corresponds to a triality in
so(4, 4), and using our last result (21), it is easy to see that i4 is indeed invariant
under heterotic-type iia duality. this fact will be instrumental in checking the duality
conjecture at the level of f 4 couplings [21].

3.2. genus g modular integral

similar methods carry over to higher-loop amplitudes, such as the higher-genus analogue
of (11), namely the integral of a lattice partition function on the 3g  3-dimensional
moduli space mg of genus g curves

d z g

d,d (gij, bij;  ) ,

(22)

i g

d = zmg

where z g
one may derive by similar methods as in the one-loop case the eigenvalue condition,

d,d is the genus g lattice sum. in this case the modular group is sp(g, z) and

so(d,d)i g

d =

dg(g + 1  d)

4

i g
d .

(23)

comparison with (17) shows that this eigenvalue agrees with the order s = g eisenstein
series in the spinor and conjugate spinor representation. this leads us to the conjecture
that the g-loop integral (22) is (up to an overall factor) given by the so(d, d, z)
eisenstein series of order g in the spinor representation:

d  e so(d,d,z)
i g

s;s=g

+ e so(d,d,z)

c;s=g

,

(24)

where the superposition of the two spinor representations is required by the o(d, d, z)
invariance of the integrand. note that normalizing (24) would require a knowledge of
the weil-peterson volume of the moduli space of genus g curves.

though less substantiated than the one-loop conjecture (21), equation (24) is
strongly reminiscent of the genus g partition function of the n = 4 topological string
[22] on t 2 which was shown to be exactly given by the eisenstein series of order s = g in
the spinor representation e sl(2,z)
;s=g (t ) [23]. this result was subsequently used to derive
a set of higher derivative topological couplings r4h 4g4 in type iib string compactied
over t 2 [24]. our conjecture (24) suggests a natural generalization of these results to
lower dimensions: the r4h 4g4 couplings between 4 gravitons and 4g  4 ramond
three-form eld-strengths in type iia compactied on t d, d  4 are given at genus g by
the so(d, d, z) constrained eisenstein series in the spinor representation with insertions
of 4g  4 charges:

i = z d10dx

xm

(m  m) e6(g1) r4 (m  hrr)4g4
(m  m(s)  m)3g2 ,

(25)

where  is the t-duality invariant dilaton, related to the ten-dimensional coupling
as e2 = vd/g2
s , and we work in units of ls. a similar conjecture also holds for

sld

eisenstein series in string theory

8

the coupling computed by the topological b-model [22], and states that the r4f 4g4
couplings between 4 gravitons and 4g  4 ramond two-form eld-strengths in type iia
compactied on t d, d  6 are given at genus g by the so(d, d, z) constrained eisenstein
series in the conjugate spinor representation with insertions of 4g  4 charges:

(26)

i = z d10dx

xm

(m  m) e6(g1) r4 (m  frr)4g4
(m  m(c)  m)3g2 .

note that the results (25) and (26) involve covariant modular functions instead of
invariant ones, but behave like eisenstein series of order 3g  2  (4g  4)/2 = g
as far as their eigenvalue and decompactication limit are concerned. they generalize
the sl(2, z) modular functions f p,q = p (p+q)/2
/[(m + n )p(m + n )q] invariant up to a
phase, that were also used in the context of non-perturbative type iib string in [25, 26].

4. non-perturbative string amplitudes

4.1. r4 couplings in toroidally compactied type ii

while eisenstein series provide a nice way to rewrite one-loop integrals such as (11), their
utility becomes even more apparent when trying to extend the perturbative computation
into a non-perturbatively exact result.
indeed, a prospective exact threshold should
reduce in a weak coupling expansion to a sum of t-duality invariant eisenstein-like
perturbative terms, plus exponentially suppressed contributions, and eisenstein series
of the larger non-perturbative duality symmetry are natural candidates in that respect.
four graviton r4 couplings in maximally supersymmetric theories have been argued
in dimension d  8 to receive no perturbative corrections beyond the tree-level and
one-loop terms, and to be eigenmodes of the laplacian on the full scalar manifold
k\ed+1(d+1)(r) as a consequence of supersymmetry. we assume both properties to
persist in lower dimensions as well, so that from the rst property we have

fr4 = 2(3)

vd
g2
s

+ id + non pert.

(27)

this result can be suggestively rewritten in terms of t-duality eisenstein series as,

fr4 =

vd
s e so(d,d,z)
g2

;s=3/2 + e so(d,d,z)

s;s=1

+ non pert.

(28)

while the ramond scalars are decoupled from the perturbative expansion by peccei-
quinn symmetries, the full non-perturbative result should depend on all the scalars in
the symmetric space k\ed+1(d+1)(r). the r4 threshold should thus be an automorphic
form of ed+1(d+1)(z) with asymptotic behavior as in (28). to obtain the non-
perturbative extension of this result, we use the fact that the singlet and spinor
representations of the t-duality group are unied into the string representation [27, 28, 5]
of the u-duality group, the tension of which is given by

t 2 = m2 +

vd
s m2(s) +
g2

v 2
d
g4
s

,m2(o) ,

(29)

eisenstein series in string theory

9

where o is an extra representation that appears when d  4. from this group theory
fact, one arrives at the non-perturbative generalization of (28): the exact four-graviton
r4 coupling in toroidal compactications of type ii theory on t d, or equivalently m-
theory on t d+1, is given, up to a factor of newtons constant, by the eisenstein series
of the u-duality group ed+1(d+1)(z) in the string multiplet representation, with order
s = 3/2:

fr4 =

vd+1
m e
l9

ed+1(d+1)(z)
string;s=3/2 .

(30)

here lm is the eleven-dimensional planck length, vd+1 = rsvd the volume of the m-
theory torus t d+1. the quantity vd+1/l9
is the u-duality invariant gravitational
constant in dimension d = 10  d. as an immediate check, the proposal has the
appropriate scaling dimension d+19+32 for an r4 coupling in dimension d = 10d.
using the eigenvalue equation (10) we can in fact determine the corresponding

m = ld8

p

eigenvalues of (30) under the laplacian on the symmetric space k\ed+1(d+1)(r)

ed+1(d+1)fr4 =

fr4 .

(31)

3(d + 1)(2  d)

2(8  d)

this property could in principle be proved from supersymmetry arguments along the
lines of [6, 8], and holds order by order in the the weak coupling expansion. in fact, using
the eigenvalues of the particle and membrane representations of the u-duality group one
arrives at the conjecture that the non-perturbative r4 amplitude in m-theory on t d+1
has three equivalent forms,
vd+1
m e
l9
again, it is easy to check that the scaling dimensions match.

ed+1(d+1)(z)

ed+1(d+1)(z)
string;s=3/2 =

l9

(d/2  1)

d/22

e

(32)

as a justication of the claim (30),

it can be shown that it reproduces the
perturbative contributions in (27) in a weak coupling expansion. moreover, taking
the d = 4 case as an example the non-perturbative terms can be interpreted as
superposition of euclidean d0 and d2-branes wrapped on a one-cycle or a three-
cycle of t 4. in addition to these terms, there are further contributions which behave
supercially as e1/g2
s . such non-perturbative eects are certainly unexpected in toroidal
compactications to d > 4, since there are no half-bps instanton congurations with
this action (the ns5-brane does have a tension scaling as 1/g2
s, but it can only give
rise to euclidean congurations with nite actions when d  4). the matching of the
tree-level and one-loop contributions together with the consistent interpretation of the
d-brane contribution is however a strong support to our conjecture.

4.2. r4h 4g4 and r4f 4g4 couplings

using the manifestly t-duality invariant forms (25) and (26) of the g-loop amplitudes,
it is also straightforward to propose a non-perturbative completion of the r4h 4g4 and
r4f 4g4 couplings, invariant under the full u-duality group. for that purpose, we
note that the set of three-form eld-strengths in m-theory compactied on t d+1 fall

eisenstein series in string theory

10

into a representation of ed+1(d+1) dual to the string multiplet. the string multiplet
decomposes under so(d, d, z) into a singlet (the neveu-schwarz hn s), a spinor (the
ramond three-forms obtained by reducing the m-theory four-form eld-strength), as
well as further terms for d  4. we therefore conjecture that the r4h 4g4 couplings
between 4 gravitons and 4g  4 three-form eld-strengths in m-theory compactied on
t d+1, d  4 are exactly given, up to a power of newtons constant, by the ed+1(d+1)(z)
constrained eisenstein series in the string representation with insertions of 4g4 charges:

as an immediate check, we note that this proposal has the appropriate scaling
dimension, while the expression also reproduces the tree-level interaction involving the
neveu-schwarz three-form only. moreover, the result (33) reproduces the g-loop result
(25). the analysis of non-perturbative eects is as in the r4 case, and shows order
e1/gs d-brane eects as well as, for d  4, contributions supercially of order e1/g2
s .
similarly, for the case of non-perturbative r4f 4g4 couplings, we note that the
two-form eld-strengths of m-theory compactied on t d+1 transform as the dual of the
particle multiplet. this makes it natural to propose that

i = z d10dx

xm

(m  m)

r4 (m  f )4g4

(m  m(particle)  m)4g5+ d

,

(34)

where the power 4g5+d/2 has been set by dimensional analysis. the particle multiplet
decomposes as a vector and conjugate spinor of so(d, d, z) in that order, so that this
proposal implies a one-loop term given by the so(d, d, z) eisenstein series of order
2g  3 + d/2 in the vector representation, plus a higher perturbative term which should
reproduce the genus g term (26). due to the presence of constraints, this statement has
not been proved at present.

5. open directions

the analysis presented here has focussed on half-bps saturated couplings in theories
with maximal supersymmetry.
it would be interesting to extend our techniques to
(i) couplings preserving a lesser amount of supersymmetry, and (ii) half bps states
in theories with less supersymmetry. given that the quadratic half-bps constraint
imposes second order dierential equations and that the quarter-bps condition is
cubic in the charges, one may envisage that quarter-bps saturated couplings should
be eigenmodes of a cubic casimir operator, and expressable as generalized eisenstein
series with quarter-bps conditions inserted.

on a more mathematical level, our results provide a wealth of explicit examples of
modular functions on symmetric spaces of non-compact type k\g, with g a real simply
laced lie group in the normal real form, that generalize the eisenstein series on the
fundamental domain of the upper half-plane. we have not addressed the question of the
analyticity of eisenstein series with respect to the order s. unfortunately, the presence

of constraints tends to give rise to ill-behaved expansions, which is the mathematical
counterpart of the physical problem raised above of understanding the instanton eects
supercially of order e1/g2
s .

it would also be interesting to understand more precisely what eisenstein series are
needed to generate the spectrum of the laplace operator for any eigenvalue (note in that
respect that the order s is no longer a good parametrization, since the relation between
the eigenvalue and s depends on the representation). from the point of view of harmonic
analysis however, eisenstein series are the least interesting part of the spectrum on such
manifolds, which should also include a discrete series of cusp forms. hopefully string
theory will provide an explicit example of these elusive objects.
