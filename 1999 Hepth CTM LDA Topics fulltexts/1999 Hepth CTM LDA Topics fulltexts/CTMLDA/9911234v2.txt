abstract

we construct the general model with only parallel positive tension 3-branes
on m 4  r1 and m 4  r1/z2. the cosmology constant is sectional constant
along the fth dimension. in this general scenario, the 5-dimensional gut scale
on each brane can be indentied as the 5-dimensional planck scale, but, the
4-dimensional planck scale is generated from the low 4-dimensional gut scale
exponentially in our world. we also give two simple models to show explicitly
how to solve the gauge hierarchy problem.

1 introduction

experiments at lep and tevatron have given the strong support to the standard
model of the strong and electroweak interactions. however, the standard model has
some unattractive features which may imply the new physics beyond the standard
model. one of these problems is that the gauge forces and the gravitational force are
not unied. another is the gauge hierarchy problem between the weak scale and the
4-dimensional planck scale. previously, two solutions to the gauge hierarchy problem
have been proposed: one is the idea of the technicolor and compositeness which lacks
calculability, and the other is the idea of supersymmetry.

more than one year ago, it was suggested that the large compactied extra
dimensions may also be the solution to the gauge hierarchy problem [1]. moreover,
half year ago, randall and sundrum [2] proposed another scenario that the extra
dimension is an orbifold, and the size of the extra dimension is not large but the 4-
dimensional mass scale in the standard model is suppressed by an exponential factor
from 5-dimensional mass scale. in addition, they suggested that the fth dimension
might be innity [3], and there may exist only one brane with positive tension at
the origin, but, there exists the gauge hierarchy problem. the remarkable aspect
of the second scenario is that it gives rise to a localized graviton eld. combining
those results, lykken and randall obtained the following physical picture [4]: the
graviton is localized on planck brane, we live on a brane separated from the planck
brane about 30 planck lengths along the fth dimension. on our brane, the mass
scale in the standard model is suppressed exponentially, which gives the low energy
scale. furthermore, we generalized those scenarios and obtained the scenario with
the following property [16]: the 4-dimensional planck scale is generated from the
low 5-dimensional planck scale by an exponential hierarchy, and the mass scale in
the standard model, which is contained in the observable brane, is not rescaled. in
short, recently, this kind of compactication or similar idea has attracted a lot of
attentions [5-27]. by the way, supergravity domain walls was discussed previously in
the 4-dimensional space-time [28].

in the model building, almost all the models [2, 4, 11, 16, 19, 26, 27] which can
solve the gauge hierarchy problem contain the branes with the negative brane tension
except lykken-randall model and oda model 1. however, mathematically speaking,
lykken-randall model [4] may not be strict because they neglected the eect from
the observable brane tension which they assumed might be very small, and in oda
model [26], the transformation is not 1-1 and may not be topological invariant. we
want to consider the model with only positive tension branes, because, as we know,
an object with negative tension can not be stable, although we might not need to
worry about it if the anti-brane is orientable 2. in addition, there are positive energy
objects, namely d-branes and ns-branes, that are well understood and on which

1 i do not consider the models with brane intersections/junctions here [6, 25], and many brane

junctions will be considered elsewhere [18].

2 i would like to thank j. x. lu for pointing out this to me.

gauge elds and matter elds can be localized so that the standard model elds can
be placed there.

before our discussion, we would like to explain our assumption and notation
which are similar to those in [16]. we assume that all the gauge forces are unied
on each 3-brane if there exist gauge forces. the 5-dimensional gut scale on i-th
3-brane m5(i)
gu t and the 5-dimensional planck scale mx are dened as the gut
scale and planck scale in the 5-dimensional fundamental metric, respectively. the 4-
dimensional gut scale on i-th 3-brane m (i)
gu t and the 4-dimenisonal planck scale mpl
are dened as the gut scale and planck scale in the 4-dimensional minkowski metric
(). in order to avoid the gauge hierarchy problem between the weak scale and the
4-dimensional gut scale mgu t on the observable brane which includes our world,
we assume the low energy unication 3. the key ansatz is that the 5-dimensional
gut scale on each brane is equal to the 5-dimensional planck scale.

in this paper, we construct the general model with only parallel positive tension
3-branes. if the fth dimension is compact, the sum of the brane tensions is zero which
is the topological invariant of this kind of models [17]. therefore, we have to go to
the non-compact fth dimension case. from dierential topology/manifold, up to
dieomorphic, there is only one connected non-compact 1-dimensional manifold: r1,
and there is only one connected non-compact 1-dimensional manifold with boundary:
h1 or r1/z2 ( the equivalence class is y  y ). therefore, the space-time we consider
is m 4r1 and m 4r1/z2 where m 4 is the 4-dimensional minkowski space-time. the
parallel positive tension 3-branes are located along the fth dimension. we construct
the most general model with above properties, calculate the 4-dimensional planck
scale and gut scale on each brane. it seems to us the gauge hierarchy problem can
be solved easily in this scenario: the 5-dimensional gut scale on each brane can
be indentied as the 5-dimensional planck scale, but, the 4-dimensional planck scale
is generated from the low 4-dimensional gut scale exponentially in our world. the
cosmology constant is sectional constant along the fth dimension, so, for any point in
m 4 r1 and m 4 r1/z2, which is not belong to any brane and the section with zero
cosmology constant, there is a neighborhood which is dieomorphic to ( or a slice of
) ads5 space. furthermore, we also give two simple models which are subsets of the
model with more branes: general two branes case, three branes with z2 symmetry.
the gauge hierarchy problem is solved explicitly in those models. one new feature is
that, sometimes, the 5-dimensional planck scale might be very large because of the
exponential factor.

3we will not explain why mgu t can be low energy scale here, but, it is possible if one considers
additional particles which change the rge running. of course, proton decay might be the problem,
but we do not disscuss this here. these subjects were discussed in [19, 29].

2 general solution and model

first, we consider the fth dimension is r1. assuming we have l + m + 1 parallel
positive tension 3-branes, and their fth coordinastes are:  < yl < yl+1 < ... <
y1 < y0 < y1 < ... < ym1 < ym < +. the 5-dimensional metric in these branes
are:
(1)

g(i)
(x)  g(x, y = yi) ,

where gab is the ve-dimensional metric, and a, b = , y 4.

the classical lagrangian is given by:

s = sgravity + sb ,

sgravity = z d4x dy g{(y) +

m 3

xr} ,

sb =

m

xi=lz d4xqg(i){li  vi} ,

(2)

(3)

(4)

where mx is the 5-dimensional planck scale, (y) is the cosmology constant, and vi
where i = l, ..., m is the brane tension. the (y) is dened as the following:

m

(y) =

xi=1
i ((y  yi1)  (y  yi)) + +(y  ym)
xi=l+1

i ((y + yi)  (y + yi1)) + (y + yl) ,

+

0

where (x) = 1 for x  0 and (x) = 0 for x < 0. so, (y) is sectional constant.

the 5-dimensional einstein equation for the above action is:

g(cid:18)rab

gabr(cid:19) = 
xi=l

[(y)g gab +
viqg(i) g(i)

 

m 

n (y  yi)] .

(5)

(6)

assuming that there exists a solution that respects 4-dimensional poincare invariance
in the x-directions, one obtains the 5-dimensional metric:

ds2 = e2(y)dxdx + dy2 .

(7)

4 we assume that g5 = 0 here. in addition, if the fth dimesnion has z2 symmetry, i. e., the

lagrangian is invariant under the transformation y  y, then, g5 = 0.

3

with this metric, the einstein equation reduces to:

2 = (y)
6m 3
x

,  =

m

xi=l

vi
3m 3
x

(y  yi) .

the general solution to above dierential equations is:

(y) =

m

xi=l

ki|y  yi| + kcy + c ,

(8)

(9)

where kc and c are constants, and ki > 0 for i = l, ..., m. the relations between the
ki and vi, and the relations between the ki and i are:

m

i1

vi = 6kim 3

kj 

xj=i

x , i = 6m 3

kj + kc)2 .

m

xj=l

(10)

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

(17)

therefore, the cosmology constant is negative except the section (at most one) with
zero cosmology constant, then, for any point in m 4  r1, which is not belong to any
brane and the section with zero cosmology constant, there is a neighborhood which is
dieomorphic to ( or a slice of ) ads5 space. moreover, the cosmology constant and
brane tensions should satisfy above equations. in order to obtain nite 4-dimensional

planck scale, we obtain the constraints: pm

the general bulk metric is:

j=l kj > |kc|.

ds2 = e2pm

i=l ki|yyi|2kcy2cdxdx + dy2 .

and the corresponding 4-dimensional planck scale is:

where

m 2

pl = m 3

m1

xi=l

ti,i+1
 ,

t,l =

1

2

e2(yl) , tm,+ =

2+

e2(ym) ,

if i,i+1 6= 0, then

and if i,i+1 = 0, then

where

ti,i+1 =

1

2i,i+1 (cid:16)e2(yi+1)  e2(yi)(cid:17) ,
ti,i+1 = (yi+1  yi)e2(yi) ,

 =

m

xj=l

kj  kc , i,i+1 =

m

xj=i+1

kj 

i

xj=l

kj  kc .

4

by the way, one can easily prove that ti,i+1 is positive, which makes sure that the
4-dimensional planck scale is positive.

in addition, the four dimensional gut scale on i-th brane m (i)

gu t is related to

the ve dimensional gut scale on i-th brane m5(i)

gu t :

m (i)

gu t = m5(i)

gu t e(yi) .

(18)

in this paper, we assume that m5(i)

gu t  mx, for i = l, ..., m.

this solution can be generalized to the solution with z2 symmetry. because
of z2 symmetry, kc = 0. there are two kinds of such models, one is the odd number
of the branes, the other is the even number of the branes. for the rst one, one just
requires that ki = ki, yi = yi, and m = l. for the second case, one just requires
that ki = ki, yi = yi, m = l, and k0 = 0 (no number 0 brane). furthermore, the
solution can also be generalized to the case in which the fth dimension is r1/z2,
one just requires that ki = ki, yi = yi, m = l, then, introduces the equivalence
classes: y  y and i th brane  (i) th brane. the only trick point in this case
is that the brane tension v0 is half of the original value, i. e., v0 = 3k0m 3
x.

3 two simple models

randall and sundrum constructed the model with only one 3-brane which is the sim-
plest model in above general construction [3]. however, the gauge hierarchy problem
is not solved in that model. in this section, we will give two explicit simple models
without gauge hierarchy problem, because all the other models with more branes will
have these simple models as subset.

(i) two brane cases with kc: their positions are y0, y1, respectively, and the val-
x are: k0, k1, respectively. and the constraint

ues of the brane tension divided by 6m 3
is k0 + k1 > |kc|. therefore, we obtain:

(y) = k0|y  y0| + k1|y  y1| + kcy + c ,

(y0) = k1(y1  y0) + kcy0 + c , (y1) = k0(y1  y0) + kcy1 + c .

(19)

(20)

assuming no section has zero cosmology constant, one obtains the four dimen-

sional planck scale:

m 2

x  
pl = m 3

k0

k2

0  (k1  kc)2 e2(y0) +

k1

1  (k0 + kc)2 e2(y1)! .

k2

(21)

without loss of generality, assuming that (y0) < (y1) and e2((y1)(y0)) <<

1, we obtain

m 2

pl = m 3

x

k0

k2

0  (k1  kc)2 e2(y0) .

(22)

5

if the brane with position y1 is the observable brane, assuming mx = k2
obtain:

0(k1kc)2

k0

m (1)

gu t = mple((y1)(y0)) .

, we

(23)

so, we can push the gut scale in our world to tev scale and 105 gev scale range if
(k0  k1 + kc)(y1  y0) = 34.5 and 30, respectively. and the value of (y0) determines
the relation between mpl and mx. explicit example: k0 = k1 = kc > 0, kc(y1  y0) =
34.5 and 30. so, kc is also an important factor to solve the gauge hierarchy problem.
if the brane with position y0 is the observable brane, we can solve the gauge
and

hierarchy problem only when (y0) > 0. assuming that mpl = k2
e2((y1)(y0)) << 1, we obtain:

0(k1kc)2

k0

m (0)

gu t = mple 1

3 (y0) ,

(24)

with (y0) = 103.5 and 90, we can have gut scale in our world at tev scale and
105 gev scale, respectively. the ve-dimensional planck scale is 1048 gev and 1044
gev, respectively.

(ii) three 3-branes with z2 symmetry, their positions are: y1, 0, y1, respec-
tively, and their brane tensions divided by 6m 3
x are: k1, k0, k1, respectively. one
obtains mpl, and the 4-dimensional gut scales on the branes at y=0 and at y=y1:

m 2

pl = m 3

xe4k1y12c  1
gu t e2k1y1c , m (1)

k0 

2k1

(2k1 + k0)k0

e2k0y1! ,

(25)

(26)

m (0)

gu t = m5(0)

gu t = m5(1)

gu t e2k1y1k0y1c ,

gu t = m5(1)

where m5(0)
gu t = mx. if the brane with position y1 is the observable brane,
one can sovle the gauge hierarchy problem. for example, assuming e2k0y1 << 1 and
k0 = mx, one obtains:

mpl = mxe2k1y1c , m (1)

gu t = mplek0y1 .

(27)

with k0y1 = 34.5 and 30, one obtains the gut scale in our world will be at tev
scale and 105 gev scale range, respectively. and the relation between mpl and mx
depends on the value of 2k1y1 + c.
in addition, if the brane with position y = 0
is the observable brane, the gauge hierarchy problem can be solved, too. assuming
mpl = k0 and e2k0y1 is very small, one obtains:

mpl = mxe 4

3 k1y1 2

3 c , m (0)

gu t = mple 2

3 k1y1 1

3 c ,

(28)

with 2k1y1 + c = 103.5 and 90, one can push the gut scale in our world to the tev
scale and 105 gev scale range, respectively. and the ve dimensional planck scale is
1048 gev and 1044 gev, respectively.
