abstract

we construct iib supergravity (viewed as dilatonic gravity) background
with non-trivial dilaton and with curved four-dimensional space. such back-
ground describes the strong coupling regime of non-susy gauge theory with
(power-like) running gauge coupling which depends on curvature. we also
speculate on such running as caused by ads time. curvature dependent
quark-antiquark potential is calculated where the geometry type of hyper-
bolic (or de sitter universe) predicts (or not) the connement. generaliza-
tion of such background (susy or non-susy) with non-constant axion is
presented. quark-antiquark potential being again curvature-dependent may
produce the standard area law for large separations.

1 introduction

ads/cft correspondence [1] may provide new insights to the understanding
of non-perturbative qcd. for example, in frames of type 0 string theory the
attempts[2] have been done to reproduce such well-known qcd eects as run-
ning gauge coupling and possibly connement. it is among the rst problems
to get the description of well-known qcd phenomena from bulk/boundary
correspondence.

in another approach one can consider iib supergravity vacuum which de-
scribes the strong coupling regime of a non-susy gauge theory. this can be
achieved by the consideration of deformed iib sg vacuums, for an example,
with non-constant dilaton which breaks conformal invariance and supersym-
metry of boundary super ym. such background will be the perturbation of
ads5  s5 vacuum. the background of such sort (with non-trivial dilaton)
which interpolates between ads (uv) and at space with singular dilaton
(ir) has been found in ref.[3] where also conformal dimensions for (dilaton
coupled) scalar have been found.

this solution of iib sg [3] has been used in ref.[4] with the interpreta-
tion of it as the one describing the running gauge coupling (via exponent of
dilaton). it has been shown that running gauge coupling has a power law be-
havior with uv-stable xed point and quark-antiquark potential[5] has been
calculated. qcd properties of such background have been discussed in detail
in refs.[6]. modications of iib sg solution with non-constant dilaton [3] due
to presence of axion[7], constant self-dual vector[8] or world volume scalar
[9] give further proof of the possible connement and asymptotic freedom of
the boundary non-susy gauge theory.

in the present paper we continue the study of running gauge coupling and
connement from iib supergravity backgrounds with non-trivial dilaton. we
generalize the solution of ref.[3] for non-zero curvature of d-dimensional space.
as a result, iib supergravity background is changing drastically. the running
gauge coupling depends explicitly on the four-dimensional curvature. the
structure of quark-antiquark potential is modied. in a sense, connement
becomes the characteristic of the universe.

the work is organized as follows. in the next section we give iib super-
gravity background with non-constant dilaton and non-at four-dimensional
space. via ads/cft it gives the curvature dependent (power-like) running
gauge coupling and quark-antiquark potential where hyperbolic geometry
supports connement. section 3 is devoted to speculation related with the

2

interpretation of running gauge coupling as the one depending from ads
time. in section 4 we generalize the background of section 2 for the case
when axion presents.
(curvature dependent) quark-antiquark potential is
found. it is shown that inationary universe (de sitter) with axion predicts
connement. some outlook is given in the last section.

2 solution, running gauge coupling and

quark-antiquark potential

we start from the following action of dilatonic gravity in d + 1 dimensions:

s = 

1

16g z dd+1xg (r    g ) .

(1)

in the following, we assume 2   and  to be positive. the action (1) is
very general. it contains the eective action of type iib string theory. the
type iib supergravity, which is the low energy eective action of the type iib
string theory, has a vacuum with only non-zero metric and the anti-self-dual
ve-form. the latter is given by the freund-rubin-type ansatz:

f = 
fijkpq = 


2  , , ,   = 0, 1,   , 4

i, j,   = 5,   , 9 .
2 ijkpq ,

(2)

the vacuum has the topology of ads5s5. since ads5 has a four dimensional
minkowski space as a subspace, especially on its boundary, ads5 has the
four dimensional poincare symmetry iso(1, 3). s5 has, of course, so(6)
symmetry.

as an extension, we can consider the solution where the dilaton is non-
trivial but the anti-self-dual ve-form is the same as in (2). furthermore if
we require the solution has the symmetry of iso(1, 3)  so(6), the metric
should have the following form:

ds2 = g dxdx + gmndxmdxn

where gmn is the metric of s5 and ref.[3]

g dxdx = f (y)dy2 + y

ijdxidxj .

d1

xi,j=0

(3)

(4)

in order to keep the symmetry of iso(1, 3)  so(6), the dilaton eld  can
only depend on y. then by integrating ve coordinates on s5, we obtain the
eective ve dimensional theory, which corresponds to d = 4 and  = 1
2 case
in (1). we keep working with above dilatonic gravity as it will be easy to
come to iib supergravity (d = 4,  = 1

2) at any step.

from the variation of the action (1) with respect to the metric g, we

gg(cid:19)

and from that of dilaton 

0 = (cid:16)gg (cid:17) .

(5)

(6)

we assume that  depends only on one of the coordinate, say y  xd as in
type iib supergravity solution with the symmetry of iso(1, 3) so(6) and
we also assume, as a generalization of (4), that g has the following form

ds2

d+1 =

x,=0

g dxdx = f (y)dy2 + y

gijdxidxj

(7)

d1

xi,j=0

here gij is the metric in the einstein manifold, which is dened by

rij = kgij .

(8)

here rij is the ricci tensor given by gij and k is a constant, especially k > 0
for sphere and k = 0 for the at minkowski space and k < 0 for hyperboloid.
such solution generalizes the previous solution of ref.[3] (where k = 0) as
boundary gauge qft lives now in four-dimensional curved spacetime. the
case of k = 1 is especially interesting as it corresponds to gauge theory in de
sitter (inationary) universe.

(12)

here r = gijrij = kd. substituting (12) into (9), we can solve it algebraically
with respect to f :

f =

when  is small, y is large and the structure of the spacetime becomes ads
asymptotically. from (15), we nd

(17)

we can compare the above behavior with that of the previous ads5  s5
solution in type iib sypergravity [4]. the ads5 part in the solution has the
form of

therefore we nd

where gs is the string coupling and n is the ux of the ve-form f in (2)
through s5, which is produced by the n coincident d3-branes. using the
denition of rs in (18), the solution (13) and (14) has the following form:

 = cz dyvuut

.

(21)

here we put  = 1
background. on the other hand, if we change the coordinate by

2 and d = 4 in order to get explicitly iib supergravity

the metric in (7) has the following form

 = z dyqf (y) ,

g dxdx = d2 + s()

gijdxidxj ,

d1

xi,j=0

6

(22)

(23)

where s() is given by solving y in (22) with respect to : s() = y().

we now consider the case k < 0. first let the dilaton eld to be constant
or small. then from eq.(13), when y decreases from the positive innity, the
function f increases and diverges at a nite value of y : y = y0 and after
that the signature of the metric seems to change. this is not, however, real
but apparent. near y = y0, the function f (y) behaves as

f (y) 

f0
y  y0

,

where f0 is a constant. when we introduce a new coordinate u by

y  y0 = u2 ,

the metric has the following form when y  y0,
xi,j=0

d+1  4f0du2 + y0

ds2

d1

ijdxidxj .

(24)

(25)

(26)

the metric in (26) is regular even when u  0 (y  y0) and there is no
curvature singularity. the change of coordinates in (25) tells that y increases
again as u increases when u > 0. then when we write the solution by the
coordinate u, the solution connects two boundaries at u =  and u = +,
which would be two d-branes. the structure of the spacetime, however,
changes when the dilaton becomes large. let us write f (y) in the following
form:

.

(27)

f (y) =

d(d  1)
4y22h(y)

,

h(y)  1 +

c2
2yd +

kd
2y

we now investigate the condition h(y) vanishes or f (y) diverges and changes
its sign. the minimum hmin of h(y) can be found by the equation dh(y)
dy = 0,
which can be solved as follows:

y = y0   

c2

k !

d1

and we nd

hmin = 1 +

k(d  1)

2

(28)

(29)

.

therefore h(y) does not vanish if hmin > 0, that is

c2 > c2

(30)

when c2 > c2
boundary at y = 0 as in the k = 0 and k > 0 cases.

0, the solution connects the boundary at y =  with the singular
we now consider the running of the gauge coupling, which is given by
the dilaton eld . from (14), when y is large and d > 2, we nd that the
dilaton eld behaves as

here    expresses the higher order terms of 1
y . in the ads string theory, the
coupling on the boundary manifold, which is the coupling in n = 4 su(n)
super-yang-mills when d = 4, is proportional to an exponential of the dilaton
eld . we now assume the gauge coupling has the following form

the next-to-leading order term is proportional to k if k 6= 0. this changes
the renormalization group equations drastically. if we multiply n
2 with g,

we obtain the t hooft coupling gh = gn

y = u 2 ,

(35)

u expresses the scale on the (boundary) d dimensional space (due to hologra-
phy [10]). following the correspondence between long-distances/high-energy
in the ads/cft scheme, u can be regarded as the energy scale of the bound-
ary eld theory. then from (32), we obtain the following renormalization
group equation

(36)
the leading behavior is identical with the previous works [4, 6, 7, 8] but the
next to leading term contains the fractional power of (g  gs) although the
square of (g gs) appears for k = 0 case. we should note that the qualitative
behavior does not depend on  which appears in the coupling (32).
hence, we found that beta-function explicitly depends on the curvature
of four-dimensional manifold. of course, curvature dependence is not yet
logarithmic as it happens with usual qfts (perturbative consideration) in
curved spacetime [11]. the power-like running of gauge coupling is much
stronger than in k = 0 case. note that previous discussion of power-like
running includes guts with large internal dimensions [12]. in the case un-
der investigation we get gauge coupling beta-function as an expansion on
fractional powers of gauge coupling.

we now consider the static potential between quark and anti-

quark[5]. we evaluate the following nambu-goto action

s =

1

2 z d drdet (cid:16)gs

xx(cid:17) .

(37)

with the string metric gs
function k() to the metric tensor in (3). especially we choose k() by

(39)

we consider the static conguration x0 =  , x1  x = , x2 = x3 =    =
xd1 = 0 and y = y(x). choose the coordinates on the boundary manifold

9

so that the line given by x0 =constant, x1  x and x2 = x3 =    = xd1 = 0
is geodesic and g11 = 1 on the line. substituting the conguration into (37),
we nd

s =

(40)

here t is the length of the region of the denition of  . the orbit of y can be
obtained by minimizing the action s or solving the euler-lagrange equation

is a constant. if we assume y has a nite minimum y0, where xy|y=y0 = 0,
e0 is given by
(42)

e0 = k ((y0)) y0 .

introducing a parameter t, we parametrize y by

y = y0 cosh t .

here e(l) expresses the total energy of the quark-anti-quark system.
the energy e(l) in (47), however, contains the divergence due to the self
energies of the innitely heavy quark and anti-quark. the sum of their
self energies can be estimated by considering the conguration x0 =  , x1 =
x2 = x3 =    = xd1 = 0 and y = y() (note that x1 vanishes here) and
the minimum of y is yd where brane would lies. we divide the region for y
to two ones,  > y > y0 and y0 > y > yd. using the parametrization of
(43) and identifying t with  (t = ) for the region  > y > y0, we nd the

here we neglected the l independent terms. note that leading and next-
to-leading term does not depend on the parameter  in (38). the leading

11

d0

behavior is consistent with the previous works and attractive since d0 =
2.39628... but we should note that next-to-leading term is linear in l(for
k = 0 it was cubic ), which does not depend on the dimension d. since
c 5

c 3

+ d2 = 3.49608 > 0 and b is negative if k is positive and vice versa

from (44). therefore the linear potential term in (49) is repulsive if k > 0
(sphere, i.e. gauge theory in de sitter universe) and attractive if k < 0
(hyperboloid). hence, curvature is responsible now for typical connement
behavior of non-perturbative quark-antiquark potential. the area law for
wilson factor is produced thanks to non-zero four-dimensional curvature.
the de sitter universe acts against connement while hyperbolic geometry
is responsible for connement (at least within present approach).

we can also evaluate the potential between monopole and anti-monopole

by using the nambu-goto action for d-string instead of (37) (cf.ref.[13]):

(51)

we should note that k() is replaced by 1
k() compared with quark anti-quark
case (40), which corresponds the replacement of   . as the potential
in (49) does not depend on  in the given order, we nd the monopole anti-
monopole potential em m is identical with eq q :

em m(l) = eq q(l) .

(52)

it is not dicult to study the curvature dependence in more detail, for exam-
ple, numerically for dierent choices of parameters and regions. nevertheless,
we dont do this as most qualitative features are clear.

speculation that one can understand running of gauge coupling also as depen-
dence from second time( ads time). it would be interesting to understand
if such a picture may have any physical meaning.

4 axionic background with non-zero curva-

ture and non-constant dilaton

let us present now the generalization of above iib sg background with non-
trivial dilaton when non-constant axion is included into the action. such
study for the case of at four-dimensional space has been presented earlier
in ref.[7] (for eects of additional scalars ,see also ref.[9]).

the obtained metric is identical to that in (13) where axion vanishes if we
replace c in (77) with c2

that d = 4.

we now introduce a new coordinate  by

(84)

we should note that k-dependence does not appear in  and  if we use the
coordinate  because it is hidden in this coordinate. if we choose 0 = 0, e 
0. since 4e can be regarded as the yang-mills coupling constant and   0
(y  +) corresponds to the ultraviolet xed point from the viewpoint of
ads/cft correspondence, the theory can be regarded as asymptotically free.
we now compare the above results with those in [7] for k = 0 and d = 4.

we introduce a new coordinate r by

eq 2c

(r  r0)! .

(85)

the coordinate transformation (85) can be given in terms of y when k = 0
and d = 4 by using (78) and (83),

y2 = k 4(r)  r c

(86)

(87)

then the solution in [7] seems to be a special case corresponding to 0 =
0 = 0.

let us consider the potential between quark and anti-quark. as we are
interested in the case of asymptotically free theory, we put 0 = 0 in (81)
and d = 4. then we nd

therefore the linear potential in the next-to-leading term becomes attractive
if k < 0 and repulsive if k > 0. the result is consistent to the potential
without axion in (49).

we now investigate the supersymmetric background. for k = 0 it has
been found in ref.[7]. we look for its k-dependent generalization. since we
consider the background where the fermion elds, that is, dilatino  and
gravitino  vanish, if the variation under some of the supersymmetry trans-
formations of these fermionic elds vanishes the corresponding supersymme-
tries are preserved. the supersymmetry transformations of these elds are
given by [14]

(96)

therefore all the supersymmetries break down in general since  and 
do not vanish. in the limit of c  0, however, we nd

  0 ,
 =

  0

 .

(97)

therefore there is a possibility that half of the supersymmetries correspond-
ing to  survives in this limit. it should be noted that, in the limit, f (y) in
(77) becomes

f =

d(d  1)
2y(cid:17)
4y22(cid:16)1 + kd

,

(98)

which tells that the metric of the spacetime becomes nothing but the metric
of ads5s5 although the dilaton and the axion elds are non-trivial. then if
we choose the spinor parameter  by using the killing spinor  in ads5  s5
as follows[14, 7]

(99)
 vanishes in the limit of c  0, which tells that half of the supersymmetry
corresponding to , in fact, survives in this limit. this situation does not
depend on k. such solution corresponds to n = 2 super ym theory with
asymptotically free gauge coupling. (note that deformations of n = 4 super
ym theory which ow to xed points like in refs.[15, 16] may also dene
running gauge coupling). in the limit of c  0, the solution in (81) and
(82) has the following form:

e  c(  0)
1
  0 

c(  0)

.

(100)

even in the limit, the theory becomes asymptotically free when 0 = 0 since
the coupling given by e vanishes in the ultraviolet limit corresponding to
 = 0. we should also note that the potential (0 = 0 case) between quark
and anti-quark in (93) is not changed in the leading and next-to-leading
orders since c is not included to the corresponding expression.

5 discussion

in summary, we found the background of iib supergravity with non-constant
dilaton, non-zero curvature of four-dimensional space-time and with (or with-
out) non-trivial axion. ads/cft interpretation of such solution gives the
(power-like) running gauge coupling and predicts its curvature dependence.
in the presence of axion, background may have half of supersymmetries un-
broken and describe n = 2 super ym theory with asymptotically free gauge
coupling. in all cases, we calculated quark-antiquark potential and showed
that the term linear on distance l explicitly depends on the curvature. hence,
curvature of universe may predict the connement.

it would be really interesting to nd further development of such scenario
so that to present more realistic (logarithmic) behavior for running gauge
coupling. clearly, major modications of background are necessary. note
in that respect the recent paper [17] where it was shown that ads orbifolds
may describe the running gauge coupling.

acknoweledgements. we would like to thank h.b. nielsen for discussion of
two-times cosmology. we are also indebted to a.tseytlin and a. sugamoto
for discussions.

appendix

in this appendix, we point out that there are many kinds of einstein mani-
folds which satisfy eq.(8). the einstein equations are given by,

g = t matter



.

(101)

here t matter
sider the vacuum solution where t matter



is the energy-momentum tensor of the matter elds. if we con-



= 0, eq.(101) can be rewritten as

r =


2

g .

(102)

for the einstein manifold
if we put  = 2k, eq.(102) is nothing but eq.
(8). the einstein manifolds are not always homogeneous manifolds like at
minkowski, (anti-)de sitter space or nariai space but they can be some black

in these solutions, the curvature singularity at r = 0 has a
form of line penetrating ads5 and the horizon makes a tube surrounding the
singularity. this conguration seems to express d-string whose boundary lies
on the boundary of ads5 or possibly d3-brane. especially in case of kerr
or kerr-(anti-)de sitter solution, the object corresponding to the singularity
has an angular momentum.

we should note that the dilaton depends on the geometry of the boundary
manifold only through k as in (14). therefore the behavior of the running
coupling or renormalization group equation is irrelevant with the existence
of the black hole singularity.
