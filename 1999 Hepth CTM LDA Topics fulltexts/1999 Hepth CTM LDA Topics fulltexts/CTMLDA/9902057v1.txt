abstract

calculations of the casimir energy for spherical geometries which are based on
integrations of the stress tensor are critically examined. it is shown that despite their
apparent agreement with numerical results obtained from mode summation methods,
they contain a number of serious errors. specically, these include (1) an improper
application of the stress tensor to spherical boundaries, (2) the neglect of pole terms
in contour integrations, and (3) the imposition of inappropriate boundary conditions
upon the relevant propagators. a calculation which is based on the stress tensor and
which avoids such problems is shown to be possible. it is, however, equivalent to the
mode summation method and does not therefore constitute an independent calculation
of the casimir energy.

in 1948 casimir [1] rst predicted that two innite parallel plates in vacuum would
attract each other. this remarkable result has its origin in the zero point energy of the
electromagnetic eld. while the latter is highly divergent, the change associated with this
quantity for specic plate congurations is found to be nite and thus in principle observable.
early work to detect this small eect [2] was characterized by relatively large experimental
uncertainties which left the issue in some doubt. more recent eorts [3] have provided quite
remarkable data, but are based on a dierent geometry from that of casimir. since a rigorous
theoretical calculation has never been carried out for the latter conguration, there remains
room for skepticism as to whether the casimir eect is as well established as is frequently
asserted.

the extension of casimirs result to problems with nonplanar boundaries has been of
considerable interest and fraught with diculties. it was achieved for the case of the con-
ducting spherical shell by boyer[4] in a remarkable but intricate calculation. his result was
subsequently veried by various methods [5-7], including in particular that of direct mode
summation [8-9]. one of the methods developed in ref. 7 consisted of integrating the radial
component of the stress tensor over the bounding surface, a technique which was subse-
quently applied to the case of the cylinder [10], the circle [11], and the dirichlet problem of
a d-dimensional sphere [12]. in view of the increasingly wide application of this technique,
it is clearly of interest to ascertain its validity.

since the electromagnetic sphere is the only known case in which a nite casimir energy
can be obtained for a nonplanar geometry using conventional (e.g., exponential) regulariza-
tion techniques, it is convenient to use this case as a specic framework for the present work.
one begins by dening the usual stress tensor for the uncoupled electromagnetic eld

where g = (1, 1, 1, 1) and

t  = f f

gf f

f  = a  a

(1)

with a being the usual vector potential [13]. the latter is taken most conveniently to be
in the radiation gauge kak = 0, a0 = 0. the vacuum expectation value of t  can clearly
be obtained from appropriate derivatives of the time ordered product

gij(x, t; x, t) = ih0|(ai(x, t)aj(x, t))+|0i

(2)

where the latter is to be evaluated in the presence of spherical conducting boundaries at
r = a and r = r where r = |x|. the limit r   is to be taken as the nal step of the
calculation.

the dierential equation for gij

t2! gij(x, t; x, t) = ij(x  x)(t  t)

with ij(x) the usual transverse delta function is to be solved for 0  r, r  a and for
a  r, r  r subject to the usual causal boundary conditions, namely positive (negative)
frequencies for t  t > 0 (t  t < 0). this is an issue of some importance since all previous
stress tensor calculations of the casimir energy for nonplanar boundaries have imposed
outgoing wave conditions in the region exterior to the surface of interest. while causal
boundary conditions follow directly from the existence of the vacuum as the state of lowest
energy, there is no way to infer outgoing wave conditions [14] for the propagator (2).

the fourier transform of the propagator is thus inferred from the boundary conditions

to have the form

gij(x, x; e) = xn

one readily obtains the form of these functions. using fln((1)

where xlm(, ) with l  1 denotes the vector spherical harmonics [15], and fln and gln are

boundary conditions.

denoting the interior and exterior radial functions by (f <

having determined the relevant propagators the problem of computing the casimir energy
ec can now be addressed. using the energy density given in (1), the propagators (4), and
the normalization conditions (5), the appropriate derivatives can be taken together with the
limits x  x and t  t. this readily yields the result

where the summation is to be taken over both the interior and exterior eigenmodes of the
system. this sum has been carefully evaluated in ref.9 using an exponential cuto with
results entirely consistent with previous calculations. thus it only remains to be determined
whether similar conclusions follow from the stress tensor method.

to pursue this issue it is to be noted that the interpretation of t kl(x) as the k compo-
nent of the force per unit area normal to a surface l comes from the k component of the
conservation law

thus

t  = 0.



t zv

dx t k0 = z

dl t kl

where the integration on the rhs is to be taken over the surface  which bounds the volume
v . since the lhs is the time rate of change of the k component of the momentum, it can
then be claimed that t kl(x) is the correct force per unit area so long as the calculation is
performed in cartesian coordinates. however, the claim has been made [7,10-12] that it is
also valid in spherical coordinates, i.e., that the force per unit area f/a on the spherical
surface is simply given by

f/a = h0|[trr(r = a  )  trr(r = a + )]|0i.

(6)

this, of course, is an assertion which can be examined by direct calculation, a task to which
attention is now directed.

at r = a the vacuum expectation value of trr can be written as h0| 1

2(b2  e2)|0i.

application of the boundary conditions at r = a together with the identity

|ylm(, )|2 =

yields the vacuum expectation value of trr(r = a  ) as the angular independent form

where ()
ln refers to the internal eigenfrequencies. the corresponding result for h0|trr(r =

gether with the replacements f <  f > and g<  g>. in order to relate this result to the
mode summation method, however, an explicit construction of the relevant eigenfunctions is
required. for the interior region r  a the normalization of the functions f <

to

in agreement with the claim of [7]. however, for the exterior of the sphere there is, of course,
a contribution only from r = a while the normalization depends upon both a and r, a

since the coecients (1,2)
vanish in the large r limit, it follows that this implies a suppres-
sion of the contribution of the external modes in the calculation of the casimir energy,thereby
contradicting eq.(8). thus the stress tensor approach does not constitute a valid approach
to this problem for the case of spherical boundaries. similar conclusions are readily obtained
for dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions.

although the conclusions reached here have been based on a very specic calculation,
they can be placed in a more general context by using techniques of covariant dierentiation.
to this end one takes the conservation law for t  in the form

t 
, = 0

or

t  +(cid:26) 

 (cid:27) t  +(cid:26) 

 (cid:27) t  = 0.

for spherical coordinates the nonvanishing independent christoel symbols are

r ) = 1/r,
r ) = ( 
(

( r
and ( 

(cid:26) r
 (cid:27) = r,
 ) = sincos,
( 

 ) = cot.

this yields for the r component of (10) that

0t r0 +

r3 rr3t rr +

sin

sint r + t r =

r

t 00

where use has been made of the tracelessness of t . since h0|t r0|0i is time independent
and h0|t r|0i = h0|t r|0i = 0, it follows that

z drdr(r3h0|t rr|0i) = z r2drdh0|t 00|0i,

and consequently

r3h0|trr(r)|0i|r2

r1 = z r2

r1

r2drh0|t 00(r)|0i

(11)

for arbitrary r1 and r2. this clearly shows that the correct inference to be drawn from (10)
is not the force equation (6) but rather the fact that the dierence between the quantities
r3h0|trr(r)|0i when evaluated on the two bounding spherical surfaces is proportional to the
total energy in that region.

it should also be noted that this result can also be inferred directly from the cartesian

tensor result

which implies that

lh0|t kl|0i = 0.

xklh0|t kl|0i = lxkh0|tkl|0i  h0|t kk|0i

= 0.

upon using once again the tracelessness of the energy momentum tensor eq.(11) clearly
follows.

it has been noted here that many of the existing calculations of the casimir eect for
a sphere have not used correct boundary conditions on the underlying propagators. more
serious is the fact that those which have used the stress tensor method have applied an
approach which fails in its application to nonplanar boundaries. in concluding this work it

7

needs to be pointed out that there exists yet a third failure in many of these calculations.
to illustrate this point it is convenient to refer to eq.(3.14) of ref.[7] which gives the casimir
energy as

where the jl terms are associated with the interior of the sphere and the h(1)
terms with the
exterior. in order to bring this result to the usual integral over bessel functions of imaginary
argument it is necessary to perform a ninety degree rotation of the contour. however, for the
case of the exterior mode part of e such a rotation fails since it does not take into account
the existence of poles of the hankel functions in the lower half plane. this is a noteworthy
reminder of the remarks made earlier concerning the fact that the outgoing spherical wave
condition for r > a cannot be derived for casimir propagators.

l

having displayed some of the problems associated with the calculation of the casimir
energy for the case of spherical boundaries it must also be acknowledged that the nal
answer is insensitive to these issues. while there may be an explanation for the fact that
three signicant errors leave the nal result unaltered, it is clear that there is no reason to
expect a recurrence of such a fortuitous outcome in future calculations of the casimir eect
for dierent geometries.
