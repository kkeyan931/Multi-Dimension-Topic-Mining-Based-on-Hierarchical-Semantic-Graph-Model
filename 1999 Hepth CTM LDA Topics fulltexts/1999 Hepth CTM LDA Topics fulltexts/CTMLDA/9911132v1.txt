we give a general decomposition of su (n ) connection and derive a gen-
eralized skyrme-faddeev action as the eective action of su (n ) qcd in the
low energy limit. it demonstrates the existence of mass gaps in qcd which
triggers the connement of color.

i. introduction

an open question in qcd is to identify the quark connement mechanism and under-
stand how it works. the monopole condensation is regarded as a possible explanation for
the connement of color through the dual meissner eect [1,2]. to realize the dual scenario
of the connement, t hooft proposed an abelian projection where the gauge group is broken
by a suitable gauge condition to its maximal abelian subgroup [2]. since the topology of the
su(n) and that of its maximal abelian subgroup u(1)n 1 are dierent, any such gauge is
singular, meaning that a gauge group element which transforms a generic su(n) connection
onto the gauge xing surface is not regular everywhere in space-time. the singularities may
form worldline that are usually interpreted as worldlines of magnetic monopoles. as a result
the original yang-mills theory turns into electrodynamics with magnetic monopoles. recent
numerical simulations show that the monopole degrees of freedom in the abelian projection
can indeed form a condensation responsible for the connement [3]. however, there still has
no satisfactory proof how the desired monopole condensation could take place in qcd.

recently, there are lots of work [4,5] done for searching the mechanism of connement
in yang-mills theory. one hopes to nd the connement mechanism based on the rst
principle. y. m. cho et al [4] provide a possible theoretical mechanism of the monopole
condensation in su(2) qcd. through utilizing the parametrization of the su(2) gauge
potential and choosing proper gauge, they showed that the monopole potential acquires a
mass through the quantum correction after integrating out all the dynamical degrees of the
non-abelian potential.

in this paper, from the similar consideration as that of cho et al, we obtain the eective
theory of su(n) qcd based on the rst principles. it is found that there exists mass gaps
in the infra-red limit of su(n) qcd corresponding to dierent abelian projection parts
of su(n) connection. a possible theoretical mechanism of the monopole condensation is
obtained in su(n) qcd. we also shows this eective theory may have special feature
at large n limit and may relate to the properties of d-brane.
in order to achieve the
goal desired, we also give a general decomposition of su(n) connection in terms of n 
1 orthonormal vectors dened by conjugating the cartan matrices by a generic su(n)
element. the su(n) connection we give corresponds to cho connection and faddeev-niemi
connection under dierent condition.

this paper is arranged as follows. in section 2, we give the general decomposition of
su(n) connection. in section 3, the eective theory of su(n) qcd is given. at last, we
give some discussion at section 4.

ii. decomposition of su (n ) gauge potential

in this section, we will give a generalized decomposition of su(n) gauge potential (con-

nection).

let m be a n-dimensional riemannian manifolds and p (, m, g) be a principal bundle
with the structure group g = su(n). a smooth vector eld a (a = 1, 2, ..., n 2  1) can
be found on the base manifold m (a section of a vector bundle over m). the covariant
derivative 1-form of a is

da = da + f abcabc

where aa is the connection 1-form

the curvature 2-form is dened as

aa = aa

dx.

f a =

1
2

f a
dx  dx = daa + gf abcab  ac

(1)

(2)

(3)

the dening representation of the su(n) lie algebra consists of n 2  1 matrices t a which
satisfy

t at b =

1
2n

ab +

i
2

f abct c +

dabct c,

(4)

where f abc are completely antisymmetric and dabc are completely symmetric. in terms of
t a, the vector eld a can be represented as matrix form

and its covariant derivative as

 = at a

d = d  ig[a, ]

(5)

(6)

conjugating the cartan matrices hi (i = 1, 2, ..., n  1) by a generic element g  su(n),
we dene n  1 vectors

which are othornormal to each other

mi = ma

i t a = ghig1

1
2

t r(mimj) = ma

i ma

j = ij.

(7)

(8)

in this way, mi make up an over determined set of coordinates on the orbit su(n)/u(1)n 1.
the covariant derivative of ma

by making use of a relation

it is easy to solve the equation (9) to get gauge potential a expressed in terms of mi as

a =

in which ai is the projection of a on the mi

we get the cho connection [6]

(13)

(14)

on 4-dimensional manifold, by choosing a complete basis of subspace of su(n) lie algebra
which is orthogonal to the subspace make up by mi, the covariant part of the gauge potential
(11) can be expressed as

 f abcdmb

imc

i = ijf abcmb

and the connection is expressed as

(16)

which is just the connection proposed by faddeev and niemi [7].

dene a covariant vector 1-form x a = x a

x a =

which is orthogonal to ma

and denote the non-covariant part of (11) as

x ama

i = 0

aa

where

c a

we can rewrite the gauge potential simply as

aa

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

the connection we obtained naturally pick out the abelian parts from the full connection.
in the expression (11) ai serve as electric potential and c serve as magnetic potential.
under the innitesimal gauge transformation

to get (26), we assume

(27)

(28)

which means the lie product of x is belong to the subspace made up by mi. this condition
is satised intrinsically at su(2) gauge theory. the further analysis of this assumption will
be showed in the forth coming paper.

in order to get the eective action expressed solely by the topological elds mi, we need

to integrate out all the dynamical degrees. consider the generating function for (26)

w [ji, j a

] = z daidx a

 exp[iz (

1

f a + aiji + x a
f a

)d4x].

(29)

to integrate out all the dynamical degrees we need to choose a proper gauge to leave mi as
a background. the techniques we use here are similar to that were used by y. m.. cho et
al [4].

firstly, we x mi as a background such that under the innitesimal gauge transformation

mi = 0,

aa

 =

from which one has

the corresponding faddeev-popov determinant can be written as

with this the generating functional takes the form with  = 1,

 and express the quartic term as

take the trivial classical congurations a

auxiliary antisymmetric eld. in one loop approximation, by making use of the dimensional
regulation, we can calculate the determinants and those terms involving only divergent parts
are

ln det ||m1|| = i

this restricted qcd action contains only the abelian projection which nevertheless has the
full non-abelian gauge degrees of freedom.

then we consider

we have to integrate out the electric degrees ai from the restricted qcd to obtain the

where  and  are the renormalized coupling constants. this is nothing but a generalized
skyrme-faddeev lagrangian to su(n). one can nd it is much complex than the case of
su(2) qcd. we have obtained the eective action of su(n) qcd from the rst principles.

iv. discussion

in the above discussion, we construct the eective theory for su(n) qcd. our analysis
shows, just like su(2) qcd, there exist the mass gaps corresponding to mi in the infra-red
limit of qcd based on the rst principles. the monopole condensation can serve as the
physical mechanism for the connement of color in su(n) qcd. however, one can nd the
mass gotten for dierent mi are the same. the reason is that we choose only one gauge
condition (37) for all mi. alternatively, one can choose n gauge condition for every mj = n
such as

7

2j = ajna + f abc2mb
f a

i mc

i  f2 = 0

then n dierent mass j are obtained and the mass term of the eective lagrangian becomes



2
i
2

(ma

i )2.

when calculating the yang-mills lagrangian, we assume (28) to remove a cross term. this
assumption may be superuous and do not aect the eective lagrangian we obtain too
much for it involves only the covariant parts of the gauge potential.

another important feature of this eective theory is that when n  , some special

terms of the lagrangian (42) manifest their importances and the others can be ignored

lef f =

we still dont know what problem it will cause. but we think it is crucial at the large n
cases, and may relate to some properties of d-brane. and we believe the last term in above
lagrangian will give rise to many interesting physical eects.

finally, we think at the large n limit the eective theory, under a suitable gauge condi-

tion, should just be the following expression

lef f =

2

which is similar to the lagrangian faddeev and niemi expect [7]. this will be a useful proof
which supports the existence of qcd string in the low energy limit at the large n case. the
more detailed study will be discussed in a forthcoming paper.
