abstract

the casimir energy of an innite compact cylinder placed in a uniform un-
bounded medium is investigated under the continuity condition for the light
velocity when crossing the interface. as a characteristic parameter in the
problem the ratio 2 = (1  2)2/(1 + 2)2 = (1  2)2/(1 + 2)2  1
is used, where 1 and 1 are, respectively, the permittivity and permeability
of the material making up the cylinder and 2 and 2 are those for the sur-
rounding medium. it is shown that the expansion of the casimir energy in
powers of this parameter begins with the term proportional to 4. the ex-
plicit formulas permitting us to nd numerically the casimir energy for any
xed value of 2 are obtained. unlike a compact ball with the same properties
of the materials, the casimir forces in the problem under consideration are
attractive. the implication of the calculated casimir energy in the ux tube
model of connement is briey discussed.

i. introduction

the calculation of the casimir energy for boundary conditions given on the surface of
an innite cylinder has turned out to be the most complicated problem in this eld [16].
in ref. [3] an attempt was undertaken to predict the casimir energy of a conducting cylin-
drical shell treating the cylinder as an intermediate conguration between a sphere and two
parallel plates. taking into account that the vacuum energies of a conducting sphere and
conducting plates have the opposite signs, the authors hypothesized that the casimir energy
of a cylindrical perfectly conducting shell should be zero. however, a direct calculation [1,2]
showed that this energy is negative as in the case of parallel conducting plates. this calcu-
lation was repeated only in recent papers [46] by making use of comprehensive methods,
more simple but more formal at the same time.

thus in spite of its half-century history the casimir eect still remains a problem where
physical intuition does not work, and in order to reveal even the sign of the casimir energy
(i.e. the direction of the casimir forces) it is necessary to carry out a consistent detailed
calculation.

the account for dielectric and magnetic properties of the media in the case of nonplanar
interface proved to be a very complicated problem in calculation of the casimir energy [7].
however if the light velocity is constant when crossing the interface, then the calculation of
the casimir energy of a compact ball [8] or cylinder [4] is the same as that for conducting
spherical or cylindrical shells, respectively. in such calculations the expansion of the casimir
energy in terms of the parameter 2 = (1  2)2/(1 + 2)2 = (1  2)2/(1 + 2)2  1 is
usually constructed, where 1 and 1 are, respectively, the permittivity and permeability of
the material making up the ball or cylinder, and 2, 2 are those for the surrounding medium.
the same velocity of light, c, in both the media implies that the condition 11 = 22 = c2
is satised.

the casimir energy of a compact ball with the same speed of light inside and outside [8]
and the casimir energy of a pure dielectric ball [911] turned out to be of the same sign: they
are positive, and consequently the casimir forces are repulsive.1 moreover, the extrapolation
of the result obtained under the condition  = c2 to a pure dielectric ball gives a fairly
good prediction [8,9].

for a compact cylinder under the condition  = c2 it has been found [4] that the linear
term in the casimir energy expansion in powers of 2 vanishes. keeping in mind the situation
with a compact ball possessing the same speed of light inside and outside and a pure dielectric
ball, it is tempting to check whether the casimir energy of a compact cylinder under the
condition  = c2 is close to the casimir energy of a pure dielectric cylinder. however, in the
case of a dielectric cylinder a principal diculty arises, namely, in the integral representation
for the corresponding spectral -function (or, in other words, for the sum of eigenfrequencies)
it is impossible to carry out the integration over the longitudinal momentum kz. on the
other hand, in ref. [4] the casimir energy of a compact dielectric cylinder was evaluated by a

magnetic congurations with 1 = 2 = 1 and 1 6= 2.

direct summation of the van der waals interaction between individual fragments (molecules)
of the cylinder. by making use of the dimensional regularization, a vanishing value for this
energy was obtained. it is worth noting that this procedure, having been applied to a pure
dielectric ball [12], gives the same result as the quantum eld theory approach [10].
in
view of all this, it is undoubtedly interesting to elucidate whether the vacuum energy of the
electromagnetic eld for a compact cylinder with the condition  = c2 vanishes exactly.
therefore, the main goal of the present paper is, namely, to extend the analysis made in [4]
up to the fourth order in . to this accuracy the casimir energy in question turns out to be
nonvanishing. our consideration is concerned with zero temperature theory only, and the
main calculation ignores dispersion.

the layout of the paper is as follows. in sec. ii the rst nonvanishing term proportional
to 4 is calculated in the expansion of the casimir energy of a compact cylinder in powers
of 2 under the condition  = c2. this term proves to be negative, and the casimir
forces seek to contract the cylinder reducing its radius, unlike the repulsive forces acting on
a compact ball under the same conditions. in sec. iii the casimir energy in the problem at
hand is calculated numerically for several xed values of the parameter 2 without assuming
the smallness of 2, and the corresponding plot is presented. in sec. iv the implication of
the obtained results in the ux tube model (hadronic string) describing the quark dynamics
inside the hadrons is considered. in the conclusion (sec. v) some general properties of the
casimir eect are briey discussed.

ii. expansion of the casimir energy in powers of 2

we start with the formulas which allow us to construct the expansion of the casimir
energy of a compact innite cylinder, possessing the same speed of light inside and outside,
in powers of the parameter 2. the derivation of these formulas can be found in the papers
cited below.

when using the mode-by-mode summation method [4] or the zeta function technique [5]
the casimir energy per unit length of a cylinder is represented as a sum of partial energies

is assumed to hold, with c being the velocity of light inside and outside the cylinder (in units
of that velocity in vacuum). the parameter 2 in eq. (2.2) is dened by the dielectric and
magnetic characteristics of the material of a cylinder and a surrounding medium

the representation (2.1), (2.2) for the casimir energy is formal because the integral in
eq. (2.2) diverges logarithmically at the upper limit, and the sum over n in eq. (2.1) is also

the casimir energy (2.9) is dened correctly because the integrals in eqs. (2.10) and
(2.11) exist and the sum in eq. (2.9) converges [4]. it is this formula that should be expanded
in powers of 2. we conne ourselves with the rst two terms in this expansion

merically only for n < n0 with a certain xed value of n0. for all the rest partial energies
with n  n0 one needs an analytic expression. we derive such a formula using the uniform
asymptotic expansion (uae) for the product of the modied bessel functions [13]. taking

from which the exact formulas (2.15) and (2.17) can be substituted by the approximate ones
(2.22) and (2.23). in ref. [4] it was shown that when calculating e(2) one can begin to use

this result obtained in [4] was interpreted there as the vanishing of the casimir energy of a
compact cylinder under the condition (2.3). however, as it will be shown below this is not
the case.

(2.27)

the casimir energy of a cylinder under consideration turned out to be negative. conse-
quentially, the casimir forces strive to contract the cylinder. the numerical coecient in
eq. (2.26) proved really to be small, for example, in comparison with the analogous coe-
cient in eq. (2.27). probably it is a manifestation of the vanishing of the casimir energy of
a pure dielectric cylinder noted in the introduction.

iii. numerical calculation of the casimir energy for

arbitrary 2

equations (2.9)(2.11) obtained in the preceding section enable one to calculate the
casimir energy e(2) numerically, without making any assumptions concerning the small-
ness of the parameter 2. comparing the results obtained by the exact formula (2.10) and
by the approximate one (2.21) we again nd the value n = n0 starting from which easymp
reproduces en precisely enough. in the general case there is its own n0 for each value of
2. obviously, one should expect a substantial deviation from eq. (2.26) only for 2  1.
moreover the main contribution into the casimir energy determined by the sum (2.9) is
given by the term e0 which is evaluated now exactly using eq. (2.11) without expanding in
powers of 2 as it has been done in the preceding section.

n

the results of the calculations accomplished in this way for e(2) are presented in fig. 1
(solid curve). here the casimir energy dened by eq. (2.26) as a function of 2 is also
plotted (dashed curve). when 2 = 1 we get the casimir energy of a perfectly conducting
cylindrical shell [4]. if we used for its calculation the approximate formula (2.26), we should
obtain for the dimensionless energy e = (4a2/c)e the value 0.0955 instead of 0.1704.
thereby, the approximate formula (2.26) at this point gives a considerable error of  70%.
at the same time the analogous formula (2.27) for a compact ball at 2 = 1 gives the casimir
energy of a perfectly conducting spherical shell with a few percent error [8,15].

iv. implication of the calculated casimir energy in the flux

tube model of confinement

the constancy condition for the velocity of gluonic eld when crossing the interface
between two media is used, for example, in a dielectric vacuum model (dvm) of quark
connement [1618]. this model has many elements in common with the bag models [19],
but among the other dierences, in dvm there is no explicit condition of the eld vanishing
outside the bag. it proves to be important for calculation of the casimir energy contribution
to the hadronic mass in dvm. the point is that in the case of boundaries with nonvanish-
ing curvature there happens a considerable (not full, however) mutual cancellation of the
divergences from the contributions of internal and external (with respect to the boundary)
regions. if only the eld conned inside the cavity is considered, as in the bag models [2022],
then there is no such a cancellation, and one has to remove some divergences by means of
renormalization of the phenomenological parameter in the model dening the qcd vacuum
energy density.

from a physical point of view the vanishing of the eld or its normal derivative precisely
on the boundary is an unsatisfactory condition, because due to quantum uctuations it is
impossible to measure the eld as accurately as desired at a certain point of the space [23].
in the dvm there is also considered a cavity that appears in the qcd vacuum when the
invariant ff   e2  b2 exceeds a certain critical value (e and b are the color elds).
inside the cavity the gluonic eld can be treated as an abelian eld in view of the asymptotic
freedom in qcd. in this approach it is assumed that in the qcd vacuum (outside the
cavity) the dielectric constant tends to zero 2  0 while the magnetic permeability tends

7

to innity 2   in such a way that the relativistic condition 22 = 1 holds. inside the
cavity 1 = 1 = 1. as it was shown in the present paper for a compact cylinder and in
ref. [8] for a compact ball, in calculation of the casimir energy the condition 11 = 22
proves to be essential, and it is possible to take the limit 2  0, 2   in the resulting
formula putting 2 = (1  2)2/(1 + 2)2 = (1  2)2/(1 + 2)2 = 1.
hence, in the dvm as a vacuum energy of gluonic eld one should take the casimir
energy of a perfectly conducting innitely thin shell having the shape either of a sphere,
or expanded ellipsoid, or cylinder.
in the last case we deal with the ux tube model of
connement [17,24,25] in which a heavy quark and antiquark are considered to be coupled
through a cylindrical cavity (ux tube) in the qcd vacuum. obviously, in the ux tube
model of connement the casimir energy of a compact cylinder calculated under the con-
dition 11 = 22 = 1 should be regarded as a quantum correction to the classical string
tension. to estimate this correction, it is necessary to dene the value of the radius a of
the ux tube. without pretending at high accuracy we shall take a of the same order as
the critical radius rc in the hadronic string model.2 at the distances between the quarks
smaller than rc the ux tube model has no sense. in the nambu-goto string model rc is
determined by the string tension m 2

the multiplier 8 makes an account for the contribution of the eight gluonic eld components
into the string tension. thus, unlike the conclusion made in [17, (1988)], the quantum
correction to the classical string tension, determined by the gluonic eld conned in the ux
tube, turned out to be essential ( 10%). this fact should be taken into account in detailed
examination of this model.

v. conclusion

the casimir energy of a compact cylinder under the condition  = c2 does not vanish,
but it is negative with the absolute value increasing as 4 for small 2. the casimir forces
seek to contract the cylinder.

the calculation of the vacuum energy for the boundary conditions of dierent geometries
both with the account for the properties of the materials and without such accounting

2in principle the radius of the gluonic tube may be deduced by minimizing the linear density of a
total energy in this model, the qcd vacuum energy being considered to be negative [25]. however
in this case a is expressed through the phenomenological parameter, the ux of the gluonic eld,
that in its turn requires a denition.

8

enables one to make the following general conclusion. in a concrete problem the direction
of the casimir forces is determined only by the geometry of the boundaries. dielectric and
magnetic properties of the media cannot change the direction of these forces.

this conclusion is conrmed by the calculation of the casimir eect for parallel con-
ducting plates, for a sphere and cylinder, these boundaries being considered in the vacuum
or dividing the materials with dierent dielectric and magnetic properties. even a dilute
dielectric cylinder mentioned above does not violate this pattern. maybe the casimir forces
in this case vanish in fact, but there are no indications that they can become repulsive.

the account for the dispersion probably does not change this inference. the calculation
of the casimir energy carried out in [28] for a compact ball with  and  dependent on
the frequencies of electromagnetic oscillations  conrms this.
in ref. [29] the casimir
forces aecting a compact cylinder when ()() = c2 were investigated. to remove
the divergences the authors introduced a double cuto over the frequency 0 and over the
angular momentum n0. the nite answer proved to be very involved and depended on the
cuto parameters, but the casimir forces are attractive as in our consideration. however
there are other points of view concerning the role of dispersion in the casimir eect [3033].
