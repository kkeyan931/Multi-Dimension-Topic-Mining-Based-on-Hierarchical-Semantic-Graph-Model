abstract

we calculate the eect of noncommutative spacetime on the greybody fac-

tor on the supergravity side. for this purpose we introduce a system of

d3-branes with a constant ns b-eld along their world volume directions

(x2, x3). considering the propagation of minimally coupled scalar with non-

zero momentum along(x2, x3), we derive an exact form of the greybody factor

in b eld. it turns out that b6=0

l

> b=0

l

. this means that the presence of

b-eld (the noncommutativity) suppresses the potential barrier surrounding

the black hole. as a result, it comes out the increase of greybody factor.

recently noncommutative geometry has attracted much interest in studying on string

and m-theory in the b-eld [17]. for simplicity, we consider supergravity solutions which

are related to d3 branes with ns b elds. according to the ads/cft correspondence [8],

the near horizon geometry of d=7 black hole solution can describe the large n limit of

noncommutative super yang-mills theory (ncsym). we take a decoupling limit to isolate

the near horizon geometry from the remaining one. it turns out that the noncommutativity

aects the ultra violet(uv) but not the infra red(ir) of the yang-mills dynamics. the

ncsym is thus not useful for studying the theory at short distances. it is well known that

an ncsym with the noncommutativity scale  on a torus of size  is equivalent to an

ordinary supersymmetric yang-mills theory (osym) with a magnetic ux if  = 2/2

is a rational number [9]. the equivalence between the ncsym and the osym can be

understood from the t-duality of the corresponding string theory. hence the osym with

b-eld is the proper description in the uv region, while the ncsym takes over in the

ir region. actually, the noncommutativity comes from the b   limit of the ordinary
theories [5,6,10].

on the other hand, it turns out that the total number of physical degrees of freedom for

the noncommutative case at any given scale coincides with the commutative case [5]. all

thermodynamic quantities of the ncsym including the entropy are the same as those of the

osym. however, in the next order correction of the -expansion, the entropy decreases in

the ncsym [11]. we remind the reader that aside the entropy, there exists an important

dynamical quantity the greybody factor(absorption cross section) for the quantum black

hole [1215]. hence it is very important to check whether there is or not a change in the

greybody factors between the commutative and the noncommutative cases. on the string

side, there was a calculation for the absorption of scalars into the noncommutative d3-branes

[16].

in this paper we wish to study the quantum aspects of d3-brane black hole in b-eld

background using a minimally coupled scalar. this may belong to the o-diagonal gravitons

polarized parallel to the brane (hab, a, b = 0, 1, 2, 3). we will derive an exact form of absorp-

2

tion cross section in b-eld on the supergravity side. however, it is not easy to obtain the

absorption cross section on the gauge theory side because the graviton can turn into pairs of

gauge bosons, scalars, or fermions in the world volume approach. in the absence of b-eld,

adding up these rates leads to the absorption cross section of hab on the superstring side

[12].

we start with the d=7 extremal black hole solution for d3-branes in a b23-eld on the

d=10 string frame [5]

cos hr(f 1).

here the asymptotic value of b-eld is b

23 = tan  and the parameter r is dened by

cos r4

b = 4gn2 with n(the number of d3-branes). here we dene r4

0 = 4gn2 for
b = 0, r for b   and rb for an arbitrary b. we note that rb > r0. and g = g
is the string coupling constant. it is obvious that for  = 0, one recovers the ordinary d3-
brane black hole with the standard ads5s5 in the near horizon. in this case the dilaton
background() is constant. but for  = /2 one nds the d3-brane black hole in the b  
limit. this actually reduces to the black d-string with the smeared coordinates x2 and x3.
in latter case, one nds a deviation from ads5s5 in the near horizon.

now let us introduce the perturbation analysis to derive the greybody factor. general

uctuations including the dilaton and the rr scalar will be given as the complicated systems

of dierential equations [17]. a simple equation may be arised from the o-diagonal graviton

uctuation of h01 [8,12]. let us set all other uctuations to zero and introduce a minimally

coupled scalar  which may be g00h01. this scalar is a good test eld in the einstein frame

because it is minimally coupled to the background spacetime. then this in the einstein

frame satises

this leads to

m (cid:16)ggm n n (cid:17)  2 (m )(cid:16)m (cid:17) = 0,

where gm n is the string frame metric in (1).

now let us consider

with 2
iyl(i) = l(l + 4)yl(i). here l(r) is the radial part of the l-partial wave of energy
. we assume the momentum dependence along the world volume directions. this is a

crucial step to translate the noncommutativity in the x2, x3 directions(the presence of b23)

into the greybody factor [5]. then eq. (3) takes the form

take the same form up to the leading-correction, there exist

some dierences to point out. first, because of  <  and r0 < r, one nds b=0

. this implies that in the presence of large b-eld(b  ), the height of potential
is lower than the case of b = 0. actually, we observe from eq.(5) that the height of the

eective potential decreases as  (that is, the strength of b-eld) increases. hence, in the

low energy scattering, one nds the larger absorption cross section b

0

than b=0

0

. the

5

greybody factor of the black hole arises as a consequence of scattering of minimally coupled

scalar o the gravitational potential barrier surrounding the horizon; that is, this is an eect

of spacetime curvature [15]. furthermore, we wish to point out that there also exists the

dierence for r in the logarithmic terms.

we have seen the eect of b   on the absorption probability for d3-branes above.
now we may ask how the greybody factor changes in the presence of arbitrary b-eld. for

an arbitrary b, we can rewrite the eq.(5) in the following form:

l(l + 4)

r2 + 2 1 +

b = (cid:26)1 + (k2

r 
(cid:27) r4

where r4

b. suprisingly, we nd that the above equation has exactly

the same form as eq.(6) with dierent r. then the absorption cross section can be read

o from (8) by substituting r0 with rb as follows

b
l = b=0

l

(r0  rb).

(16)

this is our main result. from (16) one can recover b=0

0

in (10) for  = 0 as well as b

0

one nds b6=0

in (14) for  = /2. here we point out several main features. firstly, for arbitrary b-eld,
since rb > r0 and  rb < 1. secondly, since rb incerases as   0,
the wave packet having lower energy is absorbed more easily. thirdly, the absorption cross

section in the presence of b-eld is exactly same as that in the absence of b-eld with

rb = (cid:26)1 + (k2

3) sin2 
2+k2
2

(cid:27)1/4

rb. it may imply that the scattering wave regards the geometry

as being the same with an increased ads5 radius as long as the absorption cross section

is concerned. furthermore, a recent paper [18] pointed out that the einstein metric of a

d3-brane is not changed by the presence of a b-eld. this implies that for a minimally

coupled scalar, the solution with the b-eld can be obtained from the solution without the

b-eld by replacing r0 by rb.

we conclude that the main eect of b-eld (the noncommutativity) suppresses the po-

tential barrier surrounding the black hole. as a result, one nds the increase of greybody

factor. finally we comment on the relationship between the near horizon geometry and

6

the greybody factor. taking the decoupling limit [5], the near-horizon geometry(a devia-
tion from ads3s5 for b 6= 0) plays an important role in obtaining two-point function of
 = g00h01 : ht01(k)t01(k)i  exp(ca|k|) with c = 1.69, a = qbr2
b. in the uv regime,
this decays exponentially with the momentum k = qk2

3. this is a new feature in the

noncommutative geometry. however we remind the reader that in the calculation of the

2 + k2

greybody factor we never take the decoupling limit to single the near horizon geometry out.

instead we use the dierential equation to nd the approximate solution in the whole region.

hence the near horizon geometry is not so sensitive to obtain the greybody factor. in our

case, the momentum contributes to the cross section through r4

b = {1 + k2

2 sin2 }r4

b with

a sequence r4

b > r4

b > r4
0.

note added

after our work has been done, we nd a related paper [19]. the rst version of this paper

takes over the same subject with the rr scalar (c), which is non-minimally coupled to the

background. kaya claims that the greybody factor does not change even if the large b-eld

is turned on. however, we point out that such result comes from the assumption that the

scalar eld c does not depend on the noncommuting coordinates (x2, x3). in our case, if

 does not depend on (x2, x3), equivalently, k2 = k3 = 0, we also recover the usual result

for ordinary d3-branes except with rb > r0.

it indicates that, in order to extract the

b-eld eect(the noncommutativity), the world volume dependence of the scalar eld is a

key ingredient [5,18]. it follows because the propagation of elds does not feel the presence

of b-eld if the wave does not move on the x2-x3 plane [10]. fortunately, kaya in the third

version of ref. [19] comment that b6=0

0 > b=0

0

is still valid for the case of the rr scalar by

introducing the new parameter s = q1  k2/2 < 1. in our notation,  = s and  = s.

that is, he showed that b6=0

0  s4 > b=0

0  s8.
