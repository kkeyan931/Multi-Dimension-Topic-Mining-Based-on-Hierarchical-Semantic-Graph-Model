abstract

we study dynamical aspects of holographic correspondence between d = 5 anti-de sitter su-
pergravity and d = 4 super yang-mills theory. we probe causality and locality of ambient
spacetime from super yang-mills theory by studying transmission of low-energy brane waves
via an open string stretched between two d3-branes in coulomb branch. by analyzing two
relevant physical threshold scales, we nd that causality and locality is encoded in the super
yang-mills theory provided innite tower of long supermultiplet operators are added. massive
w-boson and dual magnetic monopole behave more properly as extended, bilocal objects. we
also study causal time-delay of low-energy excitation on heavy quark or meson and nd an
excellent agreement between anti-de sitter supergravity and super yang-mills theory descrip-
tions. we observe that strong t hooft coupling dynamics and holographic scale-size relation
thereof play a crucial role to the agreement of dynamical processes.

introduction

initiated by important observation of maldacena [1], it is now widely believed that an anti-de

sitter (ads) supergravity is dual to large n limit of conformal eld theory (cft). one of the

important features of this so-called ads/cft correspondence is that the duality demonstrates

the holographic principle [15, 16, 17]  (d+1)-dimensional semi-classical gravity is holographi-

cally encoded into d-dimensional quantum eld theory.

an immediate question has been how one can decode (d+1)-dimensional semi-classical grav-

ity holographically out of d-dimensional quantum eld theory. in addressing this question, all

previous investigations on the ads/cft correspondence has focused exclusively on static as-

pects such as matching symmetries, excitation spectra and correlation functions. the hologra-

phy, however, dictates much stronger correspondence than this. it implies that one can decode

dynamical aspects of (d+1)-dimensional semi-classical gravity out of d-dimensional quantum

eld theory.

in this paper, we begin to investigate the dynamical aspects of the ads/cft correspondence

2. more specically, in the context of correspondence between semi-classical limit of anti-de

sitter type iib superstring in ve dimensions and large-n limit of su(n) super yang-mills

theory in four dimensions, we study whether and how causality and locality of the former

can be decoded out of the latter. as a probe, we will consider a macroscopic string (either

fundamental or dirichlet string), whose appropriate congurations have been idened with

heavy quark, meson or baryon [6, 7].

our main conclusion is that, in order to encode semi-classical dynamics of type iib su-

pergravity on ads5, neither conventional (keeping only dimension-four terms) nor dirac-born-

infeld form of the d = 4,n = 4 super yang-mills theory is sucient.
higher-dimensional operators encompassing short and long supermultiplets are to be included.

innite towers of

in due course of building up this conclusion, we also emphasize that, unlike at spacetime,

2being so, throughout this paper, we will reinstate c, the speed of light explicitly. the plancks constant h

is still set to unity.

1

it is quite dangerous and very often misleading to draw any conclusion on dynamical aspects

based on static ones in anti-de sitter spacetime. to illustrate this, in at space, consider an

open string stretched between two points of distance r = |x1  x2|. obviously, static mass of
the string m = r/2
s is proportional to the causal time-delay t = r/c for a pulse to propagate

from one end to the other. in anti-de sitter spacetime, as we will see in later sections, static

mass of an open string stretched radially equals to m = |u1  u2| is not relatd to the causal
time-delay t = 1

c| 1
u1  1

u2| in any simple way.

we begin with, in section 2, dynamics of a macroscopic string that corresponds to a heavy

quark or monopole in the yang-mills side. the causality and locality of semi-classical anti-de

sitter supergravity is then studied by adding a pulse on one end of the string and observing

subsequent propagation of the pulse along the string. the pulse on the string corresponds,

in the yang-mills side, to a spherical radiation wave-front of the heavy quark. we nd that

causal propagation of the pulse along the string is exactly encoded into causal propagation of

the shperical wave-front of the heavy quark.

in section 3, we study dynamics of a macroscopic string that corresponds to a heavy meson

in the super yang-mills side. we again nd that dynamics in the anti-de sitter spacetime can

be decoded correctly out of the heavy meson conguration in the super yang-mills side.

in section 4, we consider higgsing su(n) gauge group to s[u(n  2)  u(2)] and study
low-energy dynamics of massive w-boson of u(2)  u(1)  u(1). via holography, the yang-
mills theory ought to encode dynamics of two displaced d3-branes and an open string stretched

between them in the bulk of anti-de sitter spacetime. we then study (an extended version of)

thompson scattering of the open string by adding an incident low-energy plane wave on one of

the two d3-branes . the plane wave will be scattered o by the open string and, after causal

propagation along the string, part of the scattered wave will be excited on the other d3-brane.

we estimate the transmission rate of the incident power to the other d3-brane via the string

and show that the rate diers from the standard eld theory result by the causal time-delay

2

eect on the string.

in order to understand the causal time-delay phenomena better within the yang-mills theory

context, we also derive an eective lagrangian of the massive w-boson directly. the stretched

open string, whose worldsheet dynamics is governed by (1 + 1)-dimensional eld theory, couples

two separate (3 + 1)-dimensional u(1) super yang-mills theories. by integrating out the open

string excitations, we nd that dynamics of the massive w-boson in the u(1)  u(1) super
yang-mills theory is described by a charged point particle whose lagrangian contains proper-

time derivatives of innite order, similar essentially to the theory of pais-uhlenbeck [29]. this

indicates that causality and locality of anti-de sitter spacetime can be decoded out of super

yang-mills theory only if innite tower of short and long supermultiplets are included.

we end with further discussions on section 5.

2 causality and locality in flat spacetime

before dwelling into anti-de sitter spacetime, we will rst study causality and locality in at

spacetime. to make a direct comparison with anti-de sitter spacetime later, as a probe, we will

use a system consisting of two d3-branes and a open f- or d-string stretched between them.

consider, in type iib string theory, two parallel d3-branes in at spacetime x = r9,1.

the d3-branes are oriented along 0, 1, 2, 3 directions and are located along 4,   , 9 directions
at (r1, 0,   , 0) and (r2, 0,   , 0), respectively. low-energy dynamics on the d3-brane world-
volume is governed by d = 4,n = 4 super yang-mills theory with gauge group g = u(2). we
will denote generators of u(2) gauge group as ta (a = 1, 2, 3, 4), where t1,2,3 = 1,2,3 belong to

the su(2) and t4 = id to the diagonal u(1) subgroups. as the two d3-branes are separated by

a distance r = |r1 r2|, the su(2) gauge group is spontaneously broken to u(1) generated by
t3 cartan subalgebra. together with the diagonal u(1), the gauge group on the two d3-branes,
which we label by 1 and 2, is then given by h = u (1)(1) u (2)(1), generated by diagonal linear
combinations, (t3  t4)/2. a massive w-boson (or dual magnetic monopole) associated with

3

the spontaneous symmetry breaking is represented by an open f-string (or d-string) stretched

between the two d3-branes. the static mass of the w-boson and the dual magnetic monopole

is given by

mw = t r,

mm =

t
gst

r.

(2.1)

they are part of an isospin triplet under g (or its dual gauge group) and hence, under h, carry

electric (or magnetic) charges (q,q) where q = 1 3.

to investigate causality and locality of the at minkowski spacetime over the distance scale

r, one will need to excite slightly, say, the rst d3-brane and follow subsequent propagation

of the excitation, which will eventually arrive at and excite the second d3-brane. in the limit

gst  0, semi-classical dynamics of the type iib supergravity ought to obey both locality
and causality. for low-energy excitation, the leading order process in this limit will be such

that the excitation is transmitted from the rst d3-brane to the second through an open f- or

d-string stretched between them 4. when exciting brane-wave on the rst d3-brane, there are

two channels available: massless higgs or u (1)(1) gauge eld waves. in what follows, we will

consider exclusively adding a weak amplitude, plane-wave of the u (1)(1) gauge eld on the rst

d3-brane 5. the entire dynamical process is then viewed as the classic, thomson scattering of

the u (1)(1) radiation eld o the open string.

the open string stretched between the two d3-branes is casually identied with a massive w-

boson. this sounds paradoxical since the open string is an extended object whose characteristic

scale is the string scale, s, while the massive w-boson is a point-like object. an answer to this

is well-known [8] ever since the advent of the d-branes. in this section, from the dynamical

point of view, we will revisit this issue as it is intimately tied with understanding causality and

locality of the ambient spacetime in which the d-branes are embedded. specically, we will

study the thomson scattering process in two opposite limits of the massive w-boson, rst in a

point-particle limit and second in a stretched open string limit. we will nd shortly that, over

the distance scale r, super yang-mills theory will perceive nonlocality and acausality in the

limit the w-boson may be treated as a point-particle. in order to recover locality and causality,

the w-boson ought to behave more like an extended, bilocal object. crossover between the two

limits takes place, as anticipated, at r  o(s), the minimum distance scale of the ambient
spacetime when probed by type iib f-string. somewhat surprisingly, we will nd that the same

conclusion holds for a massive magnetic monopole, viz. an open d-string stretched between

the two d3-branes.

2.1 scattering of flat brane-wave by point-like w-boson

as is set up, a plane-wave of monochromatic radiation of u (1)(1) gauge eld is incident on a

free, massive w-boson of charge q and mass mw. the w-boson will be accelerated and emit

radiation and, if the energy of the incident radiation is low enough compared to the mass m,

the emitted radiation will have the same frequency as the incident radiation. the whole process

then can be described by conventional thomson scattering process, for which the w-boson is

treated as a point-particle. as the w-boson is charged under h, the emitted radiation will

consist of both u (1)(1) and u (2)(1) gauge elds eld. in terms of the d3-branes, this means that

both d3-branes will be excited by dipole oscillation of the stretched open string (interpreted as

the massive w-boson) after the incident u (1)(1) radiation on the rst d3-brane scatters o it.

2.1.1 scattering equation of motion

we will study dynamics of a massive w-boson, located at x(t), interacting with gauge elds

of the gauge group h. from the d3-brane point of view, the w-boson is realized by an open

f-string stretched between the two d3-branes. denote spatial position (on the two d3-branes)

of its endpoints as x1,2(t). in the limit the w-boson is treated as a point-particle, the position

of the w-boson x(t) ought to coincide with the two endpoint positions, x1,2(t) all the time.

5

consider an incident plane-wave radiation of the u (1)(1) gauge eld, whose wave vector and

frequency are denoted by k and , respectively. as the w-boson is charged with charge (q,q)
under h, electric eld of the incident radiation:

e(x, t) = e(1)(t) eikx,

e(1)(t) = e(1)

0 eit,

(2.2)

according to the lorentz force equation, will exert an instantaneous acceleration to the massive

w-boson:

x1(t) = x2(t) =

q
mw

e(1)(t)eikx.

(2.3)

throughout this paper, we will consider the weak eld-strength limit. in this case, the w-boson

is in nonrelativistic motion and, at leading order, the spatial dependence of the electric eld on

the right-hand side of eq.(2.3) may be ignored.

the eq.(2.3) shows that the two ends, even though separated by a distance r, accelerates

in an identical manner, viz. the stretched open f-string behaves like a rigid rod. it indicates

that, should the open f-string be treated as a point-particle, super yang-mills theory on the

d3-brane worldvolume would entail inevitably nonlocality over the distance scale r in the

direction perpendicular to the d3-brane. this is of course as it should be, in order for the

perpendicular direction to be interpreted as color isospin direction.

2.1.2 transmission rate

to appreciate the signicance of the eq.(2.3), we will now calculate the rate of energy transmis-

sion t from the rst d3-brane to the second through the stretched open string. from eq.(2.3),

one can determined the instantaneous power p (t) radiated into a polarization state  by the

w-boson is 6

(2.4)

6for a weak eld limit of the incident radiation, the w-boson may be treated as heavy enough. in this case,
spin and charge degrees of freedom decouple each other. we will henceforth treat the w-boson as a spinless
particle.

(2.7)

characteristic feature of the classical thomson scattering is that the cross-section is inde-

pendent of the frequency of the scattered radiation. the result eq.(2.6) is valid only at low

frequency limit,   mc2, for which the gauge eld can be treated as a classical wave. as the
energy of the incident radiation becomes comparable to the w-boson mass, the scattering pro-

cess should be treated quantum mechanically, viz. treating the radiation as photons. treated

in the coulomb gauge for which the transition matrix element is identical to the classial am-

plitude, the modication is from the phase space factor and hence is purely kinematical. the

result is

had we have considered a point-like limit of the magnetic monopole dual to the w-boson,

represented by an open d-string stretched between the two d3-branes, the transmission rate

would be essentially the same as above except that mw is to be replaced by the mass of the

magnetic monopole mm and that the charge q is interpreted as the dual magnetic charge.

to recapitulate, in the limit the w-boson is point-like, viz. the stretched f-string moves

rigidly, the transmission of radiation energy from the rst d3-brane to the second through

w-boson is instantaneous and is a consequence of the standard eld theory result, eq.(2.3).

based on this fact, we conclude that the d3-brane worldvolume dynamics, if treated in terms

of conventional super yang-mills theory and point-like w-bosons, would perceive nonlocality

and acausality over a distance scale r in the six-dimensional transverse space in x. from

the super yang-mills theory point of view, this conclusion should be hardly surpring as the

color isospin space is only an internal space and is not part of the four-dimensional spacetime

(worldvolume of the d3-branes).

2.2 scattering of flat brane-wave by charged open string

from the underlying string theory point of view, nonlocality and acausality over the distance

scale r are extremely bizzare. the transverse to the d3-branes is six-dimensional subspace in

x and string theory ought to exhibit locality and causality, at least over a long distance limit.

for example, energy transfer from the rst d3-brane located at r = r1 to the second at r = r2

through the open string between them ought to take a causal time delay

t 

1
c

(r2  r1) =

r
c

.

(2.11)

resolution of the puzzle is quite simple. as nonlocality and acausality has arisen from

the point-particle limit of the w-boson, one expects that locality and causality will become

transparent in the opposite limit, viz.

the w-boson (realized as an open string stretched

between the two d3-branes) is treated as a full-pledged string. this means that one will now

need to study the thomson scattering of the incident u (1)(1) radiation o a string-like w-

8

boson. in fact, in this section, we will nd that the w-boson dynamics is drastically modied

from that in the point-particle limit and that the modied dynamics is precisely what allows

to restore locality and causality of x.

2.2.1 scattering equations of motion

consider again the thomson scattering of the u (1)(1) eld radiation o the w-boson, but

now in the limit the w-boson is treated as a full-edged open string. dynamics of the string

is governed by type iib green-schwarz action, supplemented by an appropriate boundary

action. in nambu-goto formulation, which is sucient for the thomson scattering process,

the action is constructed in appendix a. after xing the -symmetry in a gauge compatible

with the boundary conditions and worldsheet reparametrization symmetries in static gauge,

whose steps are explained in detail in appendix a, one nds that the action for the string

transverse coordiinates x(r, t) is reduced to the form:

istring = z dt(cid:20)mw +
+ xi=1,2z dt qi (cid:20)a(1)

t

2 (cid:18) 1

c2 (tx)2  (rx)2(cid:19) +     (cid:21)
x1  a(1)(r, t)(cid:21)r=xi (t)

1
c

,

0 (r, t) +

(2.12)

(q1 = q2 = 1).

the rst term in the expansion represents the static mass of the string t r, which equals to

the mass of the w-boson mw (see eq.(2.1)). consider, as posed above, thomson scattering

of a low-energy, monochromatic plane-wave of the u (1)(1) gauge eld o the string endpoints.

the boundary condition of the string coordinates x(t, r) is given by

t rx(t, r)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r=r1
t rx(t, r)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r=r2

= qe(1)(t)

= 0 .

(2.13)

according to the rst boundary condition, the string endpoint x1(t) (on the rst d3-brane)

will undergo a dipole oscillation and generate a pulse that will propagate subsequently along

the string. the pulse may be decomposed into spectral components

x(t, r) = z d

2 h a() ei(tr/c) + a()ei(t+r/c) i ,

(2.14)

9

where the spectral amplitudes a(), a() are determined uniquely by the thomson scattering

boundary condition eq.(2.13):

a() = a() =

qe(1)
0
2t

(cot t  i) .

(2.15)

from eqs.(2.14, 2.15), one immediately obtains an equation of motion for the string endpoint

x1(t) on the rst d3-brane:

mw  tanh tt

tt ! x1(t) = qe(1)(t).

(2.16)

one rst nds that the inertia mass of the open string equals to the static mass, mw, as is

dictated by the underlying lorentz invariance. compared to the point-particle limit of the

w-boson, eq.(2.3), equation of motion of the endpoint x1(t) is changed to a one involving

innite-order kernel. as will be shown in section 2.3, the extra kernel, which has originated

from taking into account of the string oscillations, is what enables low-energy dynamics of the

d3-brane worldvolume to reproduce locality and causality of the ambient spacetime x. for

now, note that, due to the kernel, one may interpret the endpoint x1(t) to behave heavier than

the point-like w-boson mass mw.

what about the dynamics of the second endpoint x2(t) attached to the second d3-brane?

for point-particle limit of the w-boson, we have seen that the two endpoints behaves identically,

see eq.(2.3). what one now nds, however, is that the dynamics of the second endpoint is

governed by a dierent equation of motion:

mw sinh tt

tt ! x2(t) = qe(1)(t).

(2.17)

comparison with eq.(2.16) shows that the innite-order kernel associated with the second

endpoint is dierent from that of the rst one. in particular, the kernel lets us to interpret that

the seocond endpoint x2(t) behaves lighter than the point-like w-boson mass mw.

the eqs.(2.16, 2.17) constitute dening equations for the thompson scattering o the open

f-string. compared to the thomson scattering o the massive w-boson, new eects have

10

entered through d3-brane-separation-dependent (see eq.(2.11)), innite-order kernels. as the

two endpoints obey dierent equations of motion, at any moment, one would expect that

x1(t) 6= x2(t). therefore, from the super yang-mills theory perspective, it suggests to view
the w-boson more naturally as a sort of an extended, bi-local object.

2.2.2 transmission rate across open string

following the same steps as in section 2.1.2, it is straightforward to calculate the transmission

rate t (dened earlier in section 2.1.2) from the new equation of motion, eq.(2.17) of the string

endpoint on the second d3-brane.

actually, one will need to take into account of another important corrections to the trans-

mission rate: virtual w-boson pair and radiation reaction eects. they are entirely of eld-

theoretic origin and have nothing to do with string oscillation eects. because of these eects,

in eld theory treatment, the w-boson might be viewed roughly as a particle with an eective

size set by the w-boson compton wavelength. heuristically, the eects may be understood as

follows. low-energy dynamics of a single w-boson may be described by taking a non-relativistic

limit of the w-boson gauge eld w:

w0 =

w =

1

2mw
2mw

i

eimwc2t d  (r, t)

mwc
eimwc2t(r, t),

(2.18)

in which charge-conjugate, anti-particle part is suppressed. expanding the super yang-mills

lagrangian in the non-relativistic limit and taking the semi-classical limit, one obtains a la-

grangian for the w-boson particle:

lw =

c

x  a(cid:19) + s  b +   

(2.19)

where parts containing classical spin dynamics and interaction with higgs eld are suppressed

for brevity. following abraham-lorentz-type approach [9], it is straightforward to derive an

11

equation of motion that takes into account of radiative reaction force. one obtains

mw 1 

q2
4

t
mw

+   ! x(t) = qe0(t).

(2.20)

if one takes into account of virtual w-boson pair corrections, one also obtains a term similar

to the second on the left-hand side. at low frequency, the second term is suppressed compared

to the rst by o(/mw) and hence, according to eq.(2.4), gives rise to o(2/m 2
to the transmission rate.

w) correction

taking into account of the above eects, one obtains the transmission rate for f-string as:

tfstring =

2

3   q2

mwc2!2

(cid:18)1  2



mwc2 +   (cid:19)  1 (cid:18) 

mwc2(cid:19)2

+   ! (cid:20) t
sin t(cid:21)

2

.

(2.21)

the rst two brackets represent the result derived from the limit the w-boson is treated as

a point-particle. the third bracket is the correction due to virtual w-boson and radiation

reaction eect estimated above. the last bracket comes from the string oscillation eects, viz.

from the fact that the massive w-boson is actually a stretched open string.

it is instructive to consider the transmission rate for, instead of a f-string, a d-string is

stretched between the two d3-branes. from super yang-mills point of view, the open d-string

corresponds to a magnetic monopole dual to w-boson. in this case, scattering of the brane wave

takes place from interaction of the open d-string with magnetic component of the radiation

eld. the corresponding transmission rate is obtained straighforwardly:

tdstring =

mwc2(cid:19)2

(2.22)

where q should now be interpreted as magnetic charge of the dual w-boson. one again nds

that, apart from the kinematical, compton scattering correction, corrections of o(2/m 2
from the classical nite-size of the magnetic monopole, set by the compton wavelength of the

w) arise

w-boson, and radiation reactive force eects.

we emphasize that, for both w-boson and its dual magnetic monopole, the correction due

to nite-size and radiation reactive force eects is set by the w-boson mass, mw. given that it

12

is the only low-energy scale in the system at weak coupling limit, the fact that the correction

for both w-boson and magnetic monopole is governed by the same low-energy scale should not

be surprising. incidentally, the correction also entails an interesting deviation from s-duality

of the d = 4,n = 4 super yang-mills theory.

2.3 locality and causality in flat spacetime

from the super yang-mills theory point of view, the entire dynamical process is nothing but

the classic, thomson scattering of radiation o a massive w-boson.

figure 1: thompson scattering of a massive w-boson. the u (1)(1) plane wave eld, whose wave
front is denoted by dashed lines, is scatted o the point-like massive w-boson. the scattered
spherical wave elds of both u (1)(1) and u (2)(1) gauge groups are radiated away simultaneously.

2.3.1 retarded dynamics of string endpoints

it is easy to see that the string endpoint on the second d3-brane experiences a retarded motion.

consider now the same process as viewed from the stretched open string between the two

d3-branes. as shown in figure 2, the incident plane wave eld of u (1)(1) gauge group is

localized on the d3-brane at x4 = r1. once the incident wave eld shines the string endpoint

on this d3-brane and induce oscillatory motion, spherical wave eld of the u (1)(1) gauge group

will be radiated o. at the same time, the oscillation pulse of the endpoint will propagate along

the string and, after causal time-delay t = r/c, spherical wave eld of the u (2)(1) gauge

group will begin to be radiated o. hence, unless the two endpoints of the open string reacts

13

somehow non-locally, the radiation eld of the two gauge groups will not be simultaneous.

figure 2: a stretched f- or d-string connecting two probe d3-branes in at spacetime back-
ground. vibration of the stretched string causes retarded signal propagation between the two
d3-branes only when the separation is bigger than the string scale.

when viewed from ten-dimensional at spacetime, the d3-brane locations x5 = r1, r2 are

two distinct points between which the open string is stretched. hence, it makes all sense to

address causality and locality for processes between the two points x5 = r1, r2. when viewed

from yang-mills theory, however, the 5-th direction is interpreted as color isospin direction

dened at each point on (3 + 1)-dimensional d3-brane world-volume.

it is unimaginable to

conceive a possible causal time delay r/c for a component of the color isospin to rotate to

another.

2.3.2 physical thresholds: winding versus momentum

as is evident from the transmission rates, eqs.(2.21, 2.22), frequency-dependent corrections

are characterized by two distinct physical threshold scales inherent to the problem. the rst is

set by the w-boson mass, mw = t r, dening a physical threshold (of eld theoretic origin)

above which description in terms of abelian gauge theory with gauge group h breaks down.

the second is set by energy gap of string oscillation, 1/t = c/r, above which a point-

particle description of the w-boson breaks down. being proportional to r and inversely to

r, respectively, we shall be referring the rst threshold as winding threshold w and the

14

second as momentum threshold, m:

w = mw = t r,

m =

1
t

=

hc
r

.

(2.23)

as there are two distinct physical thresholds, depending on which one sets the lower scale,

low-energy dynamics of the open string will become quite dierent. note that winding and

momentum thresholds depend on the spatial separation r inversely. therefore, one nds a

version of string uncertainty relation

wm  o (hct ) ,

(t =

1
2
s

)

(2.24)

where the right-hand-side is set by fundamental constants only.

hence, if r  s, relevant scale for low-energy processes is set by the winding threshold.
as string oscillation excitations are completely irrelevant, the stretched open string behaves

literally like a rigid-rod, to which the d3-branes serve as a guiderail. thus, being a rigid body,

the open string is best approximated as a point-particle, w-boson. this is the limit in which

the d3-brane worldvolume dynamics is best approximated by super yang-mills theory, either

in conventional or dirac-born-infeld form.

we see that physics is non-local over the distance r. this is what we should have expected

since this is a sub-stringy scale, for which conventional spacetime picture does not hold.

if

r  s, the yang-mills theory does not provide a good description and one has to take into
account of full-edged string oscillation threshold.

normally, the massive w-boson mass t r sets a physical threshold to the yang-mills theory.

in the present case, the eective inertia masses of the string end-points have zeros at frequency

 harmonics of 1/r. this resonance eect originates from oscillatory excitation of the open

string and hence gives rise to a new physical threshold. the stretched open string will behave

essentially as a point-particle (massive w-boson) only if the new threshold is much higher than

the rst. this yields the well-known condition for validity of the yang-mills theory description

15

of the d3-branes:

t r 

1
r  r  s.

(2.25)

exactly the same condition applies for the stretched string being a d-string. stretched d-string

is identied with magnetic monopole. its classical size is given by the massive w-boson scale

t r 7 and denes the rst threshold scale. requirement that this threshold scale is much less

than the oscillation threshold scale again yields eq.(2.25).

2.3.3 stretching beyond super yang-mills theory

the above analysis tells us more. suppose r becomes larger than the string scale. this is the

regime where the conventional yang-mills theory description in terms of either renormalizable

or dirac-born-infeld action is no longer valid. nevertheless, can one still use yang-mills theory

description possibly with some modication? the above analysis, especially, the generalized

point-particle description of the stretched open string eqs.( 2.16, 2.17) suggests that this is

indeed so. the innite-order time derivatives in the equations of motion imply that, in yang-

mills theory, innite tower of long super-multiplets (which involves higher-order derivatives) is

potentially capable of describing the stretched string in terms of point-particle description. to

see this, we now turn to derivation of an eective lagrangian of the stretched open string.

3 dynamical aspect of scale-size relation

in [6, 7], it has been shown that a macroscopic f-string (d-string) in the bulk corresponds

a heavy quark (monopole) in yang-mills theory. ground-state conguration of the string is

straight, extending radially outward. harmonic uctuation of the string has been studied

previously [6, 20]. using the result, we now investigate the issue of causality and locality.

in this section, we will study dynamics of charged external probes. as a charged state forms

a super-selection sectors, it will be necessary to control long-range coulomb eld produced by

7at weak coupling, classical size of the stretched d-string t r is much larger than the compton wavelength

of the monopole t r/gst and hence a semi-classical treatment of the monopole is justiable.

16

the charged particle. this may be achieved, for example, by higgsing, viz. separating some

of the d3-branes and study charged state with respect to the gauge group of the separated

d3-branes.

by the presence of large-n d3-branes, ambient spacetime is now turned into anti-de sitter

spacetime:

ds2 = 2

s" u 2
ge (cid:16)dt2 + dx2

||(cid:17) + ge

du 2
5# .
u 2 + ged2

(3.26)

the most important consequence out of the anti-de sitter spacetime background is that the

scale position u in the anti-de sitter spacetime is related directly to the scale size r in the

super yang-mills theory:

r =

ge
u

.

(3.27)

this relation has been rst derived from evaluation of the wilson loop [6, 7] and later extended

in generality [10].

3.1 holography of heavy quark dynamics

consider a heavy quark of large-n super yang-mills theory at zero temperature. to control

long-range coulomb eld produced by the quark, we will separate a single d3-brane to the

coulomb branch and consider a quark coupled to it. denote the location of the displaced d3-

brane as u. then, a heavy quark (monopole) of the super yang-mills theory is realized by a

macroscopic f- (d-) string ending on the displaced d3-brane at u = u and stretched outward

along u-direction. dynamics of the macroscopic string may be studied using nambu-goto

action in the anti-de sitter space eq.(3.26). taking static gauge (, ) = (t, u) and expanding

string transverse coordinates (x||, 5) up to harmonic uctuations, one nds [6]

let us begin with static properties of the macroscopic string. the rst term in eq.(3.28)

represent the static mass of the string

mstring(u) = z uv

(3.30)

for any nite u, the static mass diverges as the cuto uv  . as shown rst in [6, 7]
and discussed further in [10, 11], this is nothing but anti-de sitter manifestataion of divergent

self-energy of a heavy quark. a physically meaningful, nite quantity would be a residual static

mass between strings ending on dierent locations of u, which we may dene as

mstring(u)  z u

0

du

du

= u.

(3.31)

using the scale-size relation eq.(3.27), one then nds that mstring(u) = ge/r corresponds

to the coulomb eld energy measured at radius r.

what does this mean? in order to understand this scale, let us go back to the interpretation

of the macroscopic from yang-mills theory side. at the origin of the coulomb branch (viz.

u = 0), the macroscopic string creates not only a heavy quark (transforming as the dening

representation of su(n)) itself but also long-range color coulomb eld around it, as depicted

in the left of figure 2. away from the origin of the coulomb branch, one might expects that

18

the long-range coulomb eld is cut-o at the compton wavelength u 1



of the massive gauge

bosons 8. however, as pointed out in [6, 7], the strong t hooft coupling dynamics cuts o the

long-range eld at a larger scale, geu 1
 .

figure 4: coulomb branch view gauge eld generated by a test quark (monopole)

thus, we nd that mstring is nothing but the eld energy, the energy associated with

coulomb eld outside radius r = ge/u in the yang-mills theory. summarizing, static

property (such as static mass) of the macroscopic string is determined by the quantity r du.

what about dynamical properties? consider exciting a low-energy pulse at the outer end

of the string. the pulse will then propagate at the speed of light (which has been explicitly

checked in [6]) along the string toward u. according to the uv-ir relation, in super yang-

mills theory, the pulse looks like a spherical yang-mills wave generated at the position of the

heavy quark and then propagates outward to the outer edge of the coulomb eld, r = geu 1
 .

from yang-mills point of view, for the outgoing spherical wave propagate a radial size r, it

will take yang-mills time:

(t)ym =

1
c

r.

(3.32)

if causality is implied by the holographic relation, then the time-delay for the pulse to

propagate along the string should be equal to that for the spherical wave to propagate outward.

let us check this explicitly. the string pulse propagates along the string, viz. a null geodesic

(3.33)

thus, measured in yang-mills units, the anti-de sitter time-delay (t)ads for the pulse to travel

from u =  to u = u along the string is given by
ge z u

(t)ads = 

1
c



du
u 2 =

.

(3.34)

remarkably, the holography, more specically, the uv-ir relation eq.(3.27) shows that the

bulk propagation time is exactly the same as that along the boundary!

the last quantity is precisely the time-delay for a spherical yang-mills wave to propagate

over the scale size [0, r]. we thus nd the holography works nicely as well for dynamical

properties.

in particular, we nd that locality and causality in u-direction is encoded into

causal propagation of spherical waves whose wave front varies in size.

the same analysis goes through for monopole. here, an interesting issue is posed by the

mechanism. as is well-known, the bare monopole has a semiclassical size, the mass of the

massive w-boson.

3.2 vibrating quark (monopole) at finite temperature

it is also possible to show that the causality and locality holds also for super yang-mills theory

at nonzero temperature. the near-horizon geometry of near extremal d3-branes is described

by the anti-de sitter-schwarzschild spacetime, whose (t, r) subspace is given by:

from nambu-goto lagrangian, one again nds that the static mass of the string is given by

m = z

du.

(3.36)

consider introducing a heavy quark to the yang-mills theory. once again, the quark is

described by a macroscopic f-string stretched along u-direction [20, 21], as depicted in figure

20

3. in the present case, the string terminates at the schwarzschild horizon, u = u0, where it

melts completely and dissipates the f-string ux into the inner horizon region.

this phenomenon has a direct counterpart in super yang-mills theory. at zero temperature,

coulomb eld of the static quark extends everywhere, as depicted at the left in figure 4.

at nite temperature, however, the coulomb eld becomes debye-screened and is expected

to extend to the scale of debye wavelength u 1

0 = (get )1. using the holographic uv-ir

relation, one now actually nds that the coulomb eld is cut o at a larger scale geu 1

zero temperature case, one may interpret this as reecting the fact that strong t hooft coupling

dynamics gives rise to the cuto at a larger scale geu 1

in fact, by demanding causality, one can understand the fact that string must end at u = u0.

21

to reach the position u(u0  u  ) is easily estimated:

(3.37)

the time-delay becomes innite when u  u0. the inner-horizon region u < u0 is unphysical
since the time-delay is negative, viz. acausal. as is explicit in eq.(3.37), the time delay is

measured in units of geu 1

0

reects the fact that it is a characteristic scale size in yang-mills

theory at nite temperature.

in fact, the scale r0 = geu 1

0

corresponds to a physical threshold scale in yang-mills theory

at nite temperature. at weak t hooft coupling limit, matsubara energy scale associated with

dimensionally reduced three-dimensional fermions (satisfying anti-periodic boundary condition

around euclidean time) is o(t ), which equals to u0/ge. if this observation continues to hold
somehow in super yang-mills theory at zero temperature, then we are prompted to expect

that the scale r  geu 1
that this scale is completely dierent from either compton wavelength of massive gauge bosons

actually corresponds to a new physical threshold scale. recall



u 1

 , which certainly corresponds to a physical threshold. nevertheless, the fact that the scale

r is ge times compton wavelength of massive gauge bosons is tantalizingly similar to the

observation of shenker made in a dierent context [23].

4 causality and locality in anti-de sitter spacetime

having understood dynamical aspect of the scale-size relation better, especially for semi-innite

string, we will now reconsider scattering of brane waves by an open string and consequent

implication to causality and locality, but now all in anti-de sitter spacetime.

we will now show that, throughout the moduli space of the coulomb branch (except possibly

at the origin), momentum threshold of the open string is always lower than winding threshold

in the strong t hooft coupling limit. this is precisely what is needed in order for the super

yang-mills theory to be able to encode causality and locality of the anti-de sitter spacetime.

turning around, one now nds that, in large-n, strong coupling limit of super yang-mills

theory, w-bosons ought to behave as a sort of bi-local object with innite tower of light internal

excitations.

4.1 d3-branes in the coulomb branch

the anti-de sitter spacetime is generated as the near-horizon geometry of innitely many

(n  ) d3-branes, coincident one another. therefore, to explore causality and locality of
the anti-de sitter spacetime, from the viewpoint of super yang-mills theory, one will need to

examine low-energy moduli dynamics over the coulomb branch.

as in at spacetime, we will consider displacing two out of n coincident d3-branes, at

24

positions u1, u2 respectively, and a macroscopic open string stretched between them. we will

again excite the displaced d3-branes with low-energy waves and study scattering of the waves by

the open string. the conguration corresponds to the following sequential symmetry breaking:

su(n)  g = s [u(n  2)  u(2)]  h = s [u(n  2)  (u(1)  u(1))] .

(4.45)

from super yang-mills theory perspectives, this appears quite a complicated problem, as the

excitation of, say, rst d3-brane will reach to the second d3-brane not only through the open

string stretched between them but also indirectly through the coincident (n  2) d3-branes,
with which the two d3-branes interact. at the least, because of o(n 2) possible transmission
channels through the background (n  2) d3-branes, one might be tempted to conclude that
the transmission mechanism in large-n super yang-mills theory is not mediated by massive

w-bosons but by complicated large-n, strong t hooft coupling dynamics.

this, however, should not be the case. let us study super yang-mills theory with gauge

group g = s[u(n  2)  u(2)]. as we are interested in dynamics of the two displaced d3-
branes, we will integrate out over the higgs branch, viz. open strings transforming in (n  2, 2)
and its complex-conjugate representations. in the limit n   and large t hooft coupling,
the integration amounts to resummation of large-n feynman diagrams. as have shown in

[18], the result is to produce anti-de sitter spacetime, in which the two displaced d3-branes is

embedded.

intuitively, this can be understood by observing that root-mean-squared positions of (n 2)
d3-branes and displaced two d3-branes are (gstn)1/4 and (gst)1/4, respectively. that is, in the

large-n limit, position of the two displaced d3-branes is well-localized inside the anti-de sitter

spacetime. it should also become clear that, even after adding a stretched open string between

the two displaced d3-branes (associated with the symmetry breaking g  h), integration over
the higgs branch is essentially the same, viz. both the two d3-branes and the stretched open

string between them will experience the ambient background as anti-de sitter spacetime.

henceforth, at large-n and t hooft coupling regime, in order to study causality and locality

25

over the coulomb branch, one will only need to study low-energy excitation of massive w-

boson in (quantum-corrected) super yang-mills theory with symmetry breaking pattern u(2) 
u(1)  u(1).

4.2 scattering of brane wave by charged open string

dynamics of the open string stretched between the two d3-branes is governed by the type iib

green-schwarz action in the anti-de sitter spacetime. in appendix b, for nambu-goto form

of the action, details of gauge xing of local - and reparametrization symmetries is explained.

it turns out the gauge-xing as well as analysis of string dynamics thereof become enormously

simplied once one adopts a new coordinate, r  ge/u. according to the scale-size holography
relation eq.(3.27), the new coordinate r is nothing but size variable of super yang-mills theory.

it is interesting that, in analyzing physical process in anti-de sitter spacetime, description in

terms of super yang-mills theory is more suited and ecient. indeed, in terms of the size

coordinate r, the metric of the anti-de sitter spacetime is described in poincare coordinates:

ds2

ads =

ge

r2h  dt2 + dx2

5i.
|| + dr2 + r2d2

(4.46)

as elaborated in appendix b, this coordinate choice leads the green-schwarz action to an

almost identical form, after gauge xing, to the one in at spacetime, for both bosonic and

fermions parts.

in fact, it has been observed already [6] that harmonic analysis of string

uctuation becomes considerably simplied in the poincare coordinate system. the gauge-xed

action of the open string is now given by

(4.47)

(4.48)

the rst point to note is that static mass of the string in anti-de sitter spacetime, the rst

term in eq.(4.47), ge r dr/r2 equals to (u2  u1) in terms of the original scale coordinate.

vibration of the stretched string causes retarded radiation between the two d3-branes.

similar result holds also for an open d-string stretched between the two d3-branes. hence,

mw = u,

mm =

1
gst

u.

(4.49)

recalling that u = t r (cf. eq.(3.26)), this means that static mass of the string in anti-de

sitter spacetime is the same as that in at spacetime. this is, of course, an obvious fact from

the super yang-mills theory perspective. both w-boson and dual magnetic monopole are bps-

saturated states and hence their masses are not renormalized as one interpolates from weak to

strong t hooft coupling regime. the weak and strong t hooft coupling regimes are, roughly

speaking, dual to at and anti-de sitter spacetimes.

one might have expected that, as the mass of the open string is determined by the distance

between the two d3-branes, the w-boson can serve as an excellent probe of whether the am-

bient spacetime is at or curved. for example, from yang-mills theory perspective, feynman

diagrams involving virtual w-bosons depends on the w-boson mass and hence on the distance

between the two d3-branes. large mass expansion of the feynman diagrams corresponds to

small energy expansion.

for the thomson scattering in at spacetime, we have observed that the static mass of

the w-boson and the causal time-delay are governed by one length scale, r, the separation

between the two d3-branes. one might tempted to guess that it will be the same for anti-

de sitter spacetime, as the separation is the only relevant length scale in the problem. this,

27

however, turns out not quite right. we will now show that the causal time-delay is governed

not by the scale u, but by

(4.50)

it is clear that  has no simple functional relation to u, the scale that has set the w-boson

mass for both at and anti-de sitter spacetime.

4.2.1 scattering equation of motion

consider excitation of a low-energy, monochromatic plane-wave of the u (1)(1) gauge eld on

the rst d3-brane. in static gauge, the boundary condition of the transverse string coordinates

x(t, r) is given by

ge

r2 rx(t, r)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r=r1
r2 rx(t, r)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r=r2

= qe(1)(t),

= 0 .

(4.51)

from eq.(4.47), one nds that a weak pulse propagating along the string is described by

x(t, r) = z d

2 (cid:20) a() (cid:18)1  i

r

c (cid:19) ei(tr/c) + a() (cid:18)1 + i

r

c (cid:19) ei(t+r/c)(cid:21) .

(4.52)

again, the boundary condition, eq.(4.51), xes the spectral amplitudes a(), a() uniquely:

a() = a() =   r1/ge

 !


qe(1)

eir2/c

.

(4.53)

substituting eq.(4.53) into eq.(4.52), one obtains equation of motion for the string endpoint

x1(t) on the rst d3-brane is given by:

mw 1 +

r1

r2    t

tanh  t  1!!1

x1(t) = qe(1)(t).

(4.54)

comparison with the corresponding equation eq.(equationofmotion) in the at spacetime indi-

cates that the innite-order kernal has been changed completely for both functional form and

dependence on the d3-brane locations, u1,2. the inertia mass and the fact that the kernel

makes the endpoint eectively heavier remains the same.

28

proceeding in a similar manner, one also nds an equation of motion for the string endpoint

x2(t) on the second d3-brane:

mw sinh  t

 t ! x2(t) = qe(1)(t).

(4.55)

interestingly, functional form of the innite-order kernel is exactly the same as in the at space

case, eq.(2.17). however, argument of the kernel (which denes the momentum threshold

scale) is completely changed: it was inverse of the w-boson mass r = 2

su in at spacetime,

while, in anti-de sitter spacetime, it is r = (ge/u). the threshold scale provide an

information on size of yang-mills eld conguration corresponding to the pulse propagation.

we have thus learned that causality and locality of the anti-de sitter spacetime is encoded via

pulse sizes in super yang-mills theory.

4.2.2 transmission rate across open string

it is straightforward to estimate transmission rate of the brane-wave on the rst d3-brane to the

second. as argued above, the transmission takes place eectively via the stretched open string

in the anti-de sitter spacetime background. the equation of motion eq.(secondend) shows that,

compared to the at spacetime, the innite-order kernel depends on z, separation between

the two d3-branes measured in units of size (following from scale-size relation eq.(xxx)) in the

super yang-mills theory. henceforth, the transmission rate tfstring for a f-string in anti-de

sitter spacetime is obtained straightfowardly as

tfstring =

mwc2 +   (cid:19)  1 (cid:18) 

mwc2(cid:19)2

+   ! (cid:20) 
sin (cid:21)

.

(4.56)

similarly, the transmission rate tdstring for a d-string in anti-de sitter spacetime is

tdstring =

2

3   q2

mmc2!2

(cid:18)1  2



mmc2 +   (cid:19)  1 (cid:18) 

mwc2(cid:19)2

+   ! (cid:20) 
sin (cid:21)

2

.

(4.57)

in establishing the above result, we have use the fact that, rst, both w-boson and its dual

magnetic monopole are bps-saturated and hence their masses are completely protected and

that thomson scattering process is governed solely by a perturbative expansion parameter,

29

qe(1),   mw. as such, even if the super yang-mills theory should be studied at strong
t hooft coupling limit, transmission rates derived above are consistent in so far as the brane

waves are weak enough.

4.3 locality and causality in anti-de sitter spacetime

explain why the rst endpoint is modied so drastically while the second is not.

4.3.1 physical thresholds in anti-de sitter spacetime

in the last subsection, we have derived two physical threshold scales relevant for probing causal-

ity and locality of anti-de sitter spacetime: the winding threshold scale dened by the w-boson

mass and the momentum threshold scale dened by the yang-mills scale size:

w = mw = u ;

m =

1


=

u1u2
ge

1
u

.

(4.58)

it is then clear that in strong t hooft coupling limit ge  , as u is held xed at a generic
point in coulomb branch (away from the origin), m is smaller than w. one thus nds a new

uncertainty relation for anti-de sitter spacetime:

w m  o(

u1u2
ge

).

(4.59)

note that, in contrast to the at spacetime situation, the uncertainty does depend on the

location of the two d3-branes, u1,2, viz. location in the moduli space of the coulomb branch.

as proclaimed, the causal time delay in anti-de sitter spacetime is governed by the dierence

in z-coordinate (which is identied with the size in super yang-mills theory by the holography

principle) and is not related to that in at spacetime in any simple manner.

it should now become clear that, in the strong t hooft coupling limit, the momentum

threshold m stays always lighter than the winding threshold. as such, from super yang-

mills theory perspective, the w-boson behaves more like a exible bilocal object rather than a

point-particle.

30

what about at the origin of the coulomb branch? as the momentum threshold depends

on both ge and u1,2. the answer clearly depends on the order one takes the limits ge  
and u1,2  0. if one takes ge  0 rst and then u1,2  0, it is clear that the momentum
if one takes oppositely, for example, u  0 rst and
threshold stays light all the time.

u1,2  0 afterward, the winding threshold always dominates.

4.3.2 holographic encoding in super yang-mills theory

it is then clear how the thomson scattering looks like in the large-n super yang-mills theory.

the open string is holographically projected to a shell of spherically symmetric yang-mills eld

conguration, as depicted in figure 10, whose inner and outer radius are ge/u1 and ge/u2

respectively. once the w-boson is hit by the incident plane wave, the scattered wave of the

two isospin components will emanate from each of the two radii. any observer located at

asymptotic region will then perceive the radiation as originating from the same point in space

but with a time delay (t)ym. this is how the causal time-delay in the bulk ads5 is encoded

in the boundary super yang-mills theory.

it now becomes clear how the time delay, eq.(4.50), is encoded in the super yang-mills

theory with light momentum threshold. the w-boson behaves as a exible bilocal object.

what it means is that the two radiation wave-front are separated in radial size by r. to an

observer sitting far away from the w-boson position, the two color isospin components (namely,

u (1)(1)  u (1)(1)s ) will arrive at the observers detector with a time delay  !

in super yang-mills theory, this process is nothing but thompson scattering  scattering

of low-energy photon on a heavy charged particle.

having concluded that super yang-mills theory dened either in renormalizable or in dbi

lagrangians is not capable of encoding causality and locality of anti-de sitter spacetime, we

now ask what modications, if possible, can do so. the answer to this question can be drawn

(4.1)

expanding each term in the sum in power series of  t, one immediately nds that the

interaction vertex of massive w-boson with gauge elds is governed by an innite tower of

higher-dimensional operators of the form 2m

t e.

in d = 4,n = 4 super yang-mills theory,

operators of such a form are classied as long supermultiplets.

it should not be surpring that long supermultiplets are responsible for encoding causality

and locality. we have argued that string oscillator excitations are needed to exhibit locality and

causality. it was shown that the long supermultiplets arise precisely from the massive string

excitations.

5 discussions

in this paper, we have studied several dynamical issues in the holographic correspondence be-

tween type iib supergraivty on ads5 and super yang-mills theory.

in particular, we have

investigaged how locality and causality of the ve-dimensional anti-de sitter spacetime is en-

coded into four-dimensional dynamics of super yang-mills theory. the main conclusion is that,

in order to encode causality and locality of anti-de sitter spacetime, the super yang-mills the-

32

ory ought to contain innite tower of long supermultiplets (in addition to short supermultiplets

summarized by non-abelian born-infeld lagrangian).

before closing, we would like to compare our result with earlier works, in which dynamical

issues have been briey mentioned.

appendix: eective field theory of string endpoints

in this appendix, using covariant green-schwarz formalism, we will explain derivation of

gauge-xed, open string worldsheet action, eqs.(2.12, 4.47). the derivation turns out somewhat

nontrivial, as two majorana-weyl spinors of the covariant green-schwarz action are constrained

both by -symmetry gauge-xing and by open string boundary conditions. we will show that

both requirements lead to so-called d-brane gauge as a unique choice of the spinor projection.

the d-brane gauge has been proposed previously as a natural gauge-xing condition of the 

symmetry. interestingly, we nd that exactly the same condition also arises from the analysis

of open string boundary conditions.

we will also derive, after integrating out string excitations, an eective eld theory describ-

ing low-energy dynamics of two endpoints of the string. as pointed out in sections 2 and 4, the

dynamics is described by a lagrangian with innite-order kernels, which turns out exactly the

same as (two particle generalization of) the pais-uhlenbecks model. remarkably, according to

the analysis of pais and uhlenbeck, the particular innite-order kernel is the one compatible

with convergence, positive-deniteness and causality.

a green-schwarz action in flat spacetime

dynamics of an open f- or d-string stretched between the two parallel d3-branes, as depicted in

figure 2, is governed by the covariant green-schwarz action [31]. denote bosonic and fermionic

string coordinates as (x m ; a

 ) (m = 0,   , 9; a = 1, 2;  = 1,   , 32), which map worldsheet
 (spanned by i (i = 0, 1)) to coset superspace p oincare(9, 1|2)/so(9, 1). in type iib string
theory, 1,2 are majorana-weyl spinors of same chirality. in the nambu-goto formulation, the

worldsheet action is given by

the last term in eq.(a.1) is the lagrangian describing interaction of the open string endpoints

with gauge and higgs elds on the worldvolume of the two d3-branes. denoting the d = 4,n =
4 vector supermultiplet as (a, ), the boundary lagrangian in the lowest order in derivative

expansion reads

(a.9)

for dirichlet and neumann directions, respectively. to proceed further with gauge xing, one

will need to nd linear boundary conditions for fermions that are consistent with eqs.(a.8,

a.9). because of sign dierence between a = 1, 2 terms in eqs.(a.8, a.9), a unique choice of

the linear boundary condition is of the form

a = 5ma

bb,

5  01    3,

(a.10)

where (22) matrix m is determined to be mab = ab by the requirement that the boundary
condition is compatible with majorana and weyl conditions and with invertibility of eq.(a.10).

hence, for open green-schwarz superstring attached between the two d3-branes, the boundary

conditions are:

x  = 0,

x || = 0

(ab  5ab) b = 0

(ab + 5ab) b = 0.

(a.11)

a.2 gauge fixing

due to the local -symmetry, half of the degrees of freedom of 1,2s are redundant. since

the spinors 1,2 have the same chirality, the -symmetry may be gauge xed conveniently by

setting 1 = i2 = 1

2. the gauge-xed action then reads

igs = t zz d d (cid:20)qdetix ajx a +

(a.12)

10once, on the d3-brane worldvolume, higgs and gauge elds are turned on, boundary conditions are expected
to be modied. it is easy to show, however, that higgs eld background does not modify the dirichlet boundary
condition at all, while gauge eld background aects the neumann boundary condition. as we will be considering
background elds that are weak enough, these modications will be ignored throughout.

a.3 low-energy eective lagrangian of string endpoints

we will begin with solving the equations of motion for x(t, r), subject to xed but arbitrary

location of the string endpoints, x1,2(t). consider a fourier transformed, harmonic solution

x(, r) = z dte+itx(t, r)

= a()ei(tr/c) + a()ei(t+r/c).

the boundary condition specied,

= x1(),

= x2(),

(a.17)

x(, r)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r=r1

x(, r)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r=r2

relates the spectral amplitudes a(), a() uniquely to the (fourier transformed) string end-

points x1,2(). using the relation, it is possible to express normal derivatives at the string

endpoints

r x1()  r x(, r)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r=r1

,

37

x2()  r x(, r)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r=r2

r x2() =

sin t   x1()  x2() cos t

(a.19)

in order to obtain an eective action for the string endpoints, we will need to integrate out

massive string excitations. as the string action, istring, is quadratic in x(r, t) at leading order,

it amounts to imposing the equation of motion of x(r, t) back to the action, eq.(a.16). one

then obtains, after fourier-transform back to x1,2(t),

istring = z dt (cid:20)mw 

t

2(cid:16)x2(t)  rx2(t)  x1(t)  rx1(t)(cid:17) +   (cid:21) .

(a.20)

the string action is now expressed entirely in terms of boundary data of the open string

positions on the two d3-branes.

inserting eq.(a.19) to eq.(a.20), one nally obtains the low-energy eective action of the

string endpoints:

igs = istring + id3q

(q1 = q2 = 1).

(a.22)

let us now focus on the thomson scattering by d3-brane waves, studied in section 2.

initially, the radiation eld is present only for the rst d3-brane, viz. a(2)

0 = a(2) = 0. in this

case, the equation of motion for x2(t) is reduced simply to

(cosh tt) x2(t) = x1(t),

(a.23)

38

viz. a retardation relation

x2(t) = z dt(cid:28)t(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

1

cosh tt(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

t(cid:29) x1(t).

(a.24)

after x2(t) is integrated out of istring using eq.(a.23), the low-energy eective lagrangian for

the thomson scattering process is obtained:

lthomson =  mw +
+ q(cid:20)a(1)

mw

x1(t)  tanh tt

tt ! x1(t) +

x1  a(1)(r, t)(cid:21)r=x1(t)

.

(a.25)

the eqs.(2.16, 2.17) follow immediately from the above eective lagrangian and the retardation

relation eq.(a.23).

b green-schwarz action in anti-de sitter spacetime

the green-schwarz action in ads5  s5 can be obtained in a closed form via super-coset space
construction. in nambu-goto form, the action reads

b.1 gauge fixing

in order to x the local -symmetry, it turns out most convenient to make a change of vari-

able r = ge/u and use the poincare coordinates. up to the conformal rescaling, the ten-

dimensional spacetime is at. to proceed in an analogous manner to the at spacetime situa-

tion, we will follow the observation of kallosh and take the gauge-xing

i

 = 0

where

i
  (p)i, p ij

 =

2

(0  i52)ij .

(b.29)

the -gauge-xed action is quartic in fermions. however, if one makes a change of variable

z = ge/u, as mentioned in seciton 4, the action is dramatically simplied, as the metric is

conformal to ten-dimensional at spacetime 11.

the nal form of the gauge-xed green-schwarz action of the open string is:

iads = z dt (lstring + ld3q)

where

lstring = "mw +

and the boundary interaction action is exactly the same in the at spacetime.

b.2 low-energy eective lagrangian of string endpoints

one can obtain low-energy eective lagrangian of the string endpoints repeating steps of at

spacetime case, section a.2. after fourier transformation, a harmonic solution of the string

coordinate x(, r) now takes a form

x(, r) = z dte+itx(t, r)

unnecessary.

the equations of motion of string endpoints, eqs.(4.44, 4.45).
