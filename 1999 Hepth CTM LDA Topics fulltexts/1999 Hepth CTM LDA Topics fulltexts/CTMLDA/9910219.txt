dimensional space. modifying old kaluza-klein picture , extra-dimensions must suciently com- pact, recent developpements based idea ordinary matter elds could conned three-dimensional world, corresponding ap- parent universe, gravity could live higher dimensional space . usual constraints kaluza-klein models could therefore relaxed , large extra-dimensions would conceivable, thus leading fundamental planck mass much lower apparent three-dimensional value, even low ev scale. spirit, gogberashvili  randall sun- drum ,{$9906064$}, reviving older idea , recently pointed extra dimension

interesting aspect cosmology models that, thanks symmetries, pos- sible deal non-linearities einsteins equations detect eects may appear linearized treatment. rst crucial question viability models

leaving next, linear, order. works however provided approximate perturbative analysis cosmological evolution. now, exact solutions global einsteins equa- tions extremely useful, now, solutions bulk

(12) (13) (14) since 0 gives 0 = b independent y, one integrate (12), f + 2 6 a4b + c = 0, (15) c constant integration priori depends time. assuming addition 0 5, one nds using time derivative (12) yderivative (13) b constant time. also implies c constant time. order deal last component einsteins equations (see (6)), convenient use bianchi identity, 0 = 5 ga0 = 0, rewritten (using g05 = 0, 0 0 = 5 5) form f ! = 2 3 aa2i j gj . (16) (17) one nds (using (12)) equation identically satised b = pb. hence, bulk source cosmological constant, set functions a, n, b satisfying (15) or, explicitly, na(cid:19)2 (cid:18) = ba!2 2b + 1 6 k a2 + c a4 , (18) together g05 = 0, solution einsteins equations (3), locally bulk. brane taken account using junction conditions {$9905012$}, simply relate jumps derivative metric across brane stress-energy tensor inside brane. procedure described detail 5 previous paper {$9905012$} context ve-dimensional brane cosmology (see also {$9903225$}). relevant expressions  a0b0  n0b0 = 2 3 = 2 3 b, (3pb + 2b) , (19) (20) subscript 0 a, b, n means functions taken = 0,  = q(0+) q(0) denotes jump function q across = 0. assuming symmetry simplicity, junction condition (19) used compute two sides brane, continuity 0, (18) yield generalized (rst) friedmann equation (after setting n0 = 1 suitable change time): a2 0 a2 0 = 2 6 b + 4 36 b + c 2 0 a4 k a2 0 . (21) salient features equation that, rst, bulk energy density enters linearly, second, brane energy density enters quadratically, nally cosmological evolution depends free parameter c (related choice initial conditions whole space-time), whose inuence corresponds eective radiation term (from standard point view, i.e. interpreting linearly additional term)2. one note equation generalization exact equation obtained previous paper {$9905012$}. equation enough study cosmological evolution brane, independently metric outside particular time evolution b. analysis equation postponed section 4. next section interested obtaining explicit solution whole dimensional metric. 3 explicit dependence fth dimension stabilized bulk section, shown that, help additional assumption, namely fth dimension static, sense b = 0, (22) 2from technical point view, presence free parameter, contrast standard cosmological equations, explained following way. four-dimensional cosmology, component (0,0) einsteins equations yields rst integral, contains rst derivatives time. present work, used component (0,0) integrate y, whereas time integration operated help component (5,5) contains second derivatives time. 6 possible solve full space-time metric, i.e. determine explicit dependence metric coordinate y. restriction (22) allows us go gauge (23) follows immediately equation g05 = 0, n expressed terms according relation b = 1. n = (t), (24) function depends time (and y). inserting (12) yields following dierential equation: 2 + k (aa) = 2 3 ba2, (25) valid everywhere bulk (but brane) two sides brane separately. integrated y, yielding case b < 0, a2 = cosh(y) + b sinh(y) + c, = 22 3 b, a2 = cos(y) + b sin(y) + c, = 22 3 b, case b > 0, nally (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) a2 = (cid:16)2 + k(cid:17) y2 + dy + e, b = 0. following, focus rst case b < 0, equations apply well case b > 0, transformation i, b ib. coecients a, b, c, d, e functions time, c expressible terms others determined junction conditions. symmetry imposes relations a+ = a, b+ = b b coecients two sides brane. using (19) (20), one nds b + c 2 3 = b, 2 b + c = 2(cid:18)pb + 1 3 b(cid:19) . (32) 7 c = 3 , (31) 2 + k 2b note one check explicitly energy conservation brane relations, i.e. b + 3 (b + pb) = 0. (33) a0 a0 let us nally x temporal gauge, imposing condition n0 = 1, i.e. choose time corresponds cosmic time brane. function simply a0 (see equation (24)), (26) specialized = 0 gives with, equations (31) (21), = a2 0 c, c = a2 0 2 1 + 22 b 6b ! + 3c 2ba2 0 . using rst relation (32), remaining coecient determined b = 2b 3 a2 0. (34) (35) (36) substituting back coecients b thus obtained general expression (26) using (21), one nally obtains following expression scale factor a(t, y): 2 1 + a(t, y) = ( 1 2 1 +"1 b6b 22 b 0 + 3c 22 b 6b ! a2 2ba2 0 6b ! a2 3c 0 0 sinh(|y|))1/2 a2 0# cosh(y) 2ba2 . (37) coecient metric, n(t, y), follows directly ex- pression help relation (24), i.e. n(t, y) = a(t, y) a0(t) . (38) therefore, two functions a0(t) b(t) restricted brane, obtainable solving coupled system constituted two equations (21) (33), one able infer extension metric bulk away brane. let us mention briey case b = 0. following procedure above, one would end following expression scale factor: a(t, y) = (a2 0 2b 3 a2 0|y| +( 42 36 b 0 + c a2 a2 0) y2)1/2 . (39) 8 special case c = 0, one recognizes linear solutions obtained previous paper {$9905012$}. specied whether fth dimension compact not. compact, one must check one gets end globally well dened solution (see {$9905012$}). next section devoted determination evolution scale factor brane, a0(t), using equations (21) (33), - wish emphasize - depend hypothesis (22) present section. 4 cosmological scenarios section examine consequences equation (21) cos- mological evolution inside brane. general, one still nds quadratic behaviour brane energy density leads non conventional cosmol- ogy {$9905012$}. however, suggested  , show one indeed implement idea randall sundrum {$9906064$} cosmological context recover standard cosmology. nd exact solutions match early non conventional cosmology subsequent ordinary cosmology. let us thus assume energy density brane decomposed two parts, b = + , (40) constant represents intrinsic tension brane stands ordinary energy density cosmology. substituting (21) one gets 2 + c 0 a4 follow randall sundrum choosing + b + 2 + 4 36 a2 0 a2 0 = 2 6 4 18 4 36 k a2 0 . (41) (42) 2 6 b + 4 36 2 = 0, one sees standard cosmology recovered identication (, ) 8g 4 6 , (43) . let us however keep unspecied stage. case = 0 c = 0 one would recover solutions given kaloper {$9905210$}. get analytic solutions assume ordinary matter described equation state form p = w, w constant. then, using equation (33) p, one write = (a0/a)q, q = 3(1 + w), (44) 9 constants. inserting expression (41), possible integrate explicitly resulting equation case c = 0 k = 0. assuming rst term right hand side (41) positive dening = b 62 + 2 36 , one nds, > 0, a0 = a1/q (cid:26) and, = 0, 362 hcosh(cid:16)q2t(cid:17) 1i + a0(t) = a(cid:16)2(cid:17)1/q q2 72 2t2 + 1 6 sinh(cid:16)q2t(cid:17)(cid:27)1/q t!1/q q 6 (45) , (46) (47) (the origin time chosen a0(0) = 0). clear, latter expression, case = 0, one passes early universe, charac- terized non-conventional evolution a(t) t1/q, late time phase described standard cosmology, a(t) t2/q. case > 0, suciently small, one obtains three successive phases, non-conventional phase dominated 2, conventional phase dominated and, nally, exponential phase, plays role eective cosmological constant universe. therefore, brane cosmology able produce late time acceleration phase seems needed latest cosmological observations (), price how- ever tiny mismatch compensation b tension brane. required ne-tuning expresses brane cosmological version well-known cosmological constant problem. let us nally examine case universe lled radiation (w = 1/3). possible, still k = 0, integrate explicitly case c 6= 0, c-term dependence a0 term proportional (41). moreover, free parameter c constrained nucleosynthesis. indeed, time nucleosynthesis, universe dominated radiation energy density, written rad(tn ) = g 2 30 4 n , (48) g eective number relativistic degrees freedom time. standard model, g(standard) = 10.75, deviation g strongly constrained observed abundances light elements, typically g < 2. model, since additional c-term evolves like radiation, also seen eectively additional relativistic degrees freedom, subject usual constraint, c(tn ) 3c 8ga4(tn ) 10 2 15 4 n (49) nucleosynthesis. conclude, wish recall main results work. first, shown one obtain rst integral einsteins equations, provides, brane, relation analogous (rst) friedmann equation depends geometry matter content brane, except constant parameter. second, b = 0, one extend explicitly solution found brane whole spacetime. finally, shown, ex- hibiting exact solutions, brane cosmology appears compatible, late times, standard cosmology, randall-sundrum type model. respect, important question future investigations wether (exact quasi) randall- sundrum conguration naturally reached dynamical scenario early universe. note added: several papers discuss related issues appeared quasi simultaneously one  (see also {$9910174$}).
