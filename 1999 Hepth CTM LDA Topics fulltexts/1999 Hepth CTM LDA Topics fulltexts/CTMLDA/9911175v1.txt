we show that the de donder-weyl (dw) covariant hamiltonian eld equations of
any eld can be written in dun-kemmer-petiau (dkp) matrix form. as a conse-
quence, the (modied) dkp matrices  (55 in four space-time dimensions) are of
universal signicance for all elds admitting the dw hamiltonian formulation, not
only for a scalar eld, and can be viewed as eld theoretic analogues of the symplec-
tic matrix, leading to the k-symplectic (k=4) structure. we also briey discuss
what could be viewed as the covariant poisson brackets given by -matrices and the
corresponding poisson bracket formulation of dw hamiltonian eld equations.

in the end of the thirties is was observed [1] (see [2] for historical details) that the
rst order form of the klein-gordon and the proca eld equations can be represented in
the dirac-like matrix form

where -matrices fulll the relation

u  mu = 0,

 +  =  + 

(1)

(2)

which denes the so-called dun-kemmer-petiau (dkp) algebra (for a textbook intro-
duction see, e.g., [3, 4]).

later on similar considerations have been extended to higher-spin theories [57], gauge
elds [8, 9], curved space-time [10], and even to the einstein gravity [9, 11] and arbitrary
non-linear equations (see [4,9,11] and the references therein). from a more mathematical
point of view dkp algebras have been considered, e.g., in [7, 1214].

the starting point of dkp formulation (1) is the lagrangian framework since the
components of the wave function u in (1) are essentially the eld variables and their rst
space-time derivatives. for example, for the scalar eld  eq. (1) is a matrix formulation
of the rst order form of the klein-gordon equation (cid:3) = m2:

 = m,
 = m

(3)

a particular representation of -matrices arises from rewriting (3) in the form (1) using
the column wave function u := ( 1

my, y)t .

recently, we have argued that another rst order form of the eld equations is of
interest in eld theory since it represents a manifestly covariant generalization of the
hamiltonian formulation from mechanics to eld theory [15]. we mean the so-called de
donder-weyl (dw) formulation [16] which can be summarized as follows. let us consider
a eld theory given by the lagrangian density l = l(ya, ya
 , x) which is a function of
 = ya, and space-time variables x
eld variables ya, rst derivatives (jets) of elds ya
( = 1, ..., n). then we can dene a set of variables p
, called polymomenta,
and the analogue of the hamilton canonical function h := p
  l = h(ya, p
a, x),
called the dw hamiltonian function, such that the euler-lagrange eld equations take
the dw hamiltonian form

a := l/ya
aya

ya = h/p
a ,
p

a = h/ya.

(4)

a comparison of (4) with (3) suggests an idea of representing the dw hamiltonian
equations (4) in a matrix form similar to (1).

let us rst discuss what would be an analogue of the procedure under discussion
for a mechanical system with a single degree of freedom.
in this case we have the
conguration space variable q and the conjugate momentum variable p which fulll the
hamilton equations of motion

tq = h/p,
tp = h/q.

(5)

if we introduce a column matrix corresponding to the phase space vector z := (p, q)t
equations (5) can be written in the matrix form

tz = 1zh,

(6)

where

 := (cid:18) 0

1

1

0 (cid:19)

is the symplectic matrix. alternatively, one can rewrite (6) in the form resembling (1)

tz = zh.

the objective of this paper is to demonstrate that the dw hamiltonian eld equations
(4) can be written in the form of dkp equations and to argue that in this case -matrices
can be viewed as eld theoretic generalizations of the symplectic matrix in mechanics.

henceforth we assume for simplicity the space-time to be four-dimensional euclidean,
r4 (a generalization to other dimensions and signatures is rather straightforward). first,
we consider a scalar eld theory with a single eld variable y  r. let us introduce
the ve-component quantity z v := (p1, p2, p3, p4, y)t  r4  r, v = 1, 2, ..., 5 (for clarity,
we drop the dimensionful factors which may be easily restored when necessary). then,
similarly to (3) and (1), the dw hamiltonian equations (4) can be represented in the
matrix form

where -matrices (= the modied dkp matrices) are as follows

uvz v = h/z u,

from the comparison of (8) with (7) it becomes obvious that -matrices (9) are in a
sense eld theoretic analogues of the symplectic matrix in mechanics. more specically,
they represent the so-called k-symplectic structure given by the set of k = 4 symplectic
forms  := dp  dy:1

 = 

uvdz u  dz v.

(10)

by direct evaluation one can establish that -matrices fulll the following relation

 +  = ( + )

(11)

which is similar to the dening relation of the dkp algebra, eq. (2), up to a sign factor
in the right hand side.
the minus sign in (11) could be absorbed in redenition of
-matrices:   i, but in the present context this redenition seems to be unnatural
and will not be used in what follows.

1note, that the notion of the k-symplectic structure was introduced in [17] (see also [18] and
the references therein). recently it found interesting applications in studying wave propagation in open
systems [19]. note also that our -matrices are 4-dimensional analogues of matrices k and m introduced
in [19] in two space-time dimensions, our h corresponding to s in [19].

as a consequence of (11) we obtain the properties of -matrices

which are similar, up to a sign, to the usual properties of dkp matrices (see, e.g., [1,3]).
the extension of the present formulation to the multicomponent elds is dierent
from the usual way the dkp formulation is extended from scalar to vector elds (cf. [3]).
instead of a multicomponent column variable here we introduce the 5  m matrix, z v
a,
of eld variables ya (a = 1, ..., m) and polymomenta p

z v

a :=

(13)

then the dw canonical equations (4) for an arbitrary m-component eld can be written
in the form


uvz v

a = h/z ua.

(14)

we conclude, therefore, that our 5  5 -matrices have a universal signicance for all
elds which can be represented in dw canonical form (4), not only for a one-component
scalar eld as with the usual dkp formulation.

a similarity between -matrices and the symplectic matrix in mechanics allows us to

introduce the bracket operation of functions of variables z u:

{f, g} :=

f

z u ()uv g
z v ,

(15)

which is antisymmetric, fullls the leibniz rule and a generalization of the jacobi identity:

{{f, g}(k}) + cyclic(f, g, k) = 0,

(16)

where a() := 1
2(a + a ), and thus could be considered as an analogue of the poisson
bracket. when written in explicit form this bracket coincides with the one put forward
earlier by good [20] and tapia [21]. however, the potential problem with the bracket
(15) is that it maps two functions to a vector, and that it is not obvious what is the math-
ematical meaning of the analogue of the jacobi identity, eq. (16). besides, although the
bracket (15) allows us to write the dw hamiltonian equations (4) in bracket formulation:
as a consequence of (8) and (15) we obtain

z = h/z = {z, h},

(17)

dkp formulation of covariant hamiltonian dynamics

it is not clear how this formulation could be extended to more general observables (here,
functions of ya and p

a) to be a proper generalization of tf = {h, f } in mechanics.

alternatively, one could try to introduce a bracket operation which maps two vectors
to a vector (cf., e.g., the last equation in [22]). however, a satisfactory formula consistent
with a version of the leibniz rule and the jacobi idenity so far is not known to us.

let us recall that in our previous papers [15] another poisson bracket operation for
the de donder-weyl formulation was introduced using a more geometric point of view.
the bracket is dened on dierential forms representing observables and is based on the
notion of what we call the polysymplectic form. whether or not a connection with the
constructions of the present paper can be established is a question yet to be investigated.
in fact, a relationship between dkp and cliord algebras [13, 14] and a geometric char-
acter of the latter, as well as a relation between the k-symplectic structure (10) and
the polysymplectic form used in [15], imply such a connection.

a natural question is whether or not the structures described in the present paper,
viewed as eld theoretic generalizations of the structures of the hamiltonian formalism
in mechanics, could be useful for an inherently covariant canonical quantization in eld
theory. a natural starting point of quantization of this type would be the canonical
bracket following from (15)

{p

a, yb} = b

a.

(18)

however, at present it is not known how the dirac quantization rule should be general-
ized to a -indexed bracket. let us note that a conceptually related approach to eld
quantization based on dw hamiltonian formulation can be developed [23] using the afore
mentioned (graded) poisson bracket on dierential forms.
