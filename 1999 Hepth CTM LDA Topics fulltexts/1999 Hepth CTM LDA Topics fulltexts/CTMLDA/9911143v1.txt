abstract

p-form gauge theories with stueckelberg coupling are quantized
in an irreducible antield-brst way. as a consequence, neither the
ghosts of ghosts nor their antields appear. some irreducible gauge
conditions are inferred naturally within our formalism. in the end we
briey discuss the interacting case.

pacs number: 11.10.ef - lagrangian and hamiltonian approach

the necessity of covariantly quantizing gauge theories with open alge-
bras has stimulated the development of the antield-brst formalism [1]
[5], which represents the most powerful quantization method known so far.
the power of this treatment resides, among others, in its capacity of be-
ing applied to reducible gauge theories, i.e., to those systems whose gauge
transformations are not independent. a typical class of redundant models
is expressed by gauge theories involving p-form gauge elds. such theories
are important due to their link with string theory and supergravity mod-
els [6][11]. their brst quantization [12] has been performed until now
only in a reducible manner by introducing ghosts of ghosts and a pyramid of
non-minimal variables.

in this paper we prove that p-form gauge theories with stueckelberg cou-
pling allow for an irreducible antield-brst quantization. as a consequence
of our irreducible treatment, the ghosts of ghosts and their antields do not
appear. the main steps implied in our procedure consist in: (i) the construc-
tion of an irreducible system associated with the starting redundant model;
(ii) the proof of the fact that we can consistently replace the brst quanti-
zation of the initial theory with the quantization of the irreducible system;
(iii) the antield-brst quantization of the irreducible model. finally, the
analysis is extended to interacting theories.
we start with the lagrangian action [13]

initially, we construct the irreducible theory associated with the starting
model. corresponding to the relations (3), we introduce the elds k+1 
(a1...pk1, h 1...pk2) for every k  1 odd, and the gauge parameters
k+1  (1...pk1, 1...pk2) for every k  2 even. we take the gauge
transformations of the new elds of the form a1...p2k2 = [1  2...p2k2]
m 1...p2k2 + 1...p2k2 (with k = 0, . . . , a), and h 1...p2k3 =
[1  2...p2k3] + m1...p2k3 + 1...p2k3 (with k = 0, . . . , b). we em-
ployed the notations a = p/2  1, b = p/2  2 for p even, respectively,
a = (p  3) /2 and b = (p  3) /2 for p odd. all the gauge transforma-
tions of the original and newly introduced elds are irreducible.
indeed,
taking 1...p2k1 = [1  2...p2k1] and 1...p2k2 = [1  2...p2k2] 
m1...p2k2, the above gauge transformations vanish if and only if one has
1...p2k = [1  2...p2k] and 2...p2k1 = [1  2...p2k1] m1...p2k1,
hence 1...p2k1 = 0 and 1...p2k2 = 0, such that the irreducibility is
manifest. now, we consider the theory described by the lagrangian action

reducible gauge transformations. in this way, we associated an irreducible
model with the starting reducible theory. this irreducible system will be rel-
evant by virtue of the subsequent antield-brst analysis. it is well-known
that the brst dierential, s, splits into two dierentials playing dierent
roles. the rst dierential, which is usually called the koszul-tate opera-
tor, , realizes an algebraic resolution of the smooth functions dened on the
stationary surface of eld equations. the main feature of this operator is
its acyclicity, namely hl () = 0 for every non-vanishing antighost number
l, where hl () denotes the lth order homological group of . the second
dierential is the (model of) longitudinal exterior derivative along the gauge
orbits, d, and takes into account the gauge invariances on the stationary
surface. in the sequel we analyze these two dierentials.

first, we investigate the acyclicity of  in connection with the irreducible
model built above. the minimal antield spectrum includes the variables

1...p2k2, k = 0, . . . , a, where c = p/2, d = p/2  1 for p even, respec-
tively, c = d = (p  1) /2 for p odd. the antields a and h  are fermionic
and of antighost number one, while the antields   and c  are all bosonic
and possess antighost number two. the standard brst denitions of  act-
ing on the elds and antighost number one antields yield a1...p2k = 0,

we prove that with the present antield spectrum at hand, the acyclicity
of  is ensured on the basis of the prior denitions. from the above deni-
tions, we nd at resolution degree one the non-trivial co-cycles h

1...p2k1,
1...p2k , k = 1, . . . , c, and h

proof is given for deniteness in the case p even, the other situation be-
ing similar. the starting point is represented by the last equations from
(5) and (6), namely  
  a, respectively, c  =

indicating that all the above mentioned co-cycles are trivial in the homol-
ogy of . with these results at hand, and, at the same time, invoking the
irreducibility of the gauge transformations, it follows that there are no other
non-trivial co-cycles, so  is acyclic. we underline that the acyclicity was es-
tablished employing just the previous antield spectrum, that contains only
generators of antighost number one or two.

next, we investigate the longitudinal exterior derivative along the gauge
orbits associated with the irreducible model. the minimal ghost spectrum
contains the fermionic pure ghost number one ghost elds 1...p2k1, k =
0, . . . , d and c 1...p2k2, k = 0, . . . , a. the usual denition of d acting
on the elds leads to da1...p = [1  2...p], dh 1...p1 = [1 c 2...p1] +
m1...p1, da1...p2k2 = [1  2...p2k2] mc 1 ...p2k2 +1...p2k2
(with k = 0, . . . , a), dh 1...p2k3 = [1 c 2...p2k3] + m1...p2k3 +
c 1...p2k3 (with k = 0, . . . , b), while for the ghosts we standardly have
d1...p2k1 = 0 (for k = 0, . . . , d), dc 1...p2k2 = 0 (for k = 0, . . . , a).
first, we show that the irreducible and original models possess the same
observables. the equations fullled by an observable, f , of the irreducible
model read as

where m(k) = 1/ (p  2k  2), n(k) = p  2k  1 for k = 0, . . . a, and
p(k) = 1/n(k), q(k) = p2k for k = 0, . . . d. we exploit equations (1112) level
by level, beginning with the last relations. for deniteness, we illustrate the
procedure for p even, the opposite situation being treated along the same

line. in this case, the last equations are expressed by m f
h  = 0,
a = 0. applying  on the second relation and
and 
using the rst equation, we nd ( + m 2) f
a = 0, which further implies
f
introduc-
a = 0 due to the invertibility of the klein-gordon operator.
ing f
a = 0 in the starting relations, we obtain in addition  f
h  = 0 and
 f
h  . taking into account the next equation from (11), namely
1
a + 3
h  = 0, multiplied by  and on behalf of the
2[
prior additional relations, it follows f
h  = 0. similarly, we derive that f
does not depend on the new elds, and, moreover, satises the equations

a1 ...p1 = 0, which are noth-
ing but the equations checked by any observable of the redundant theory.
thus, any observable of the irreducible system is an observable of the re-
ducible one. the converse also holds, i.e., any observable, f , of the reducible
model is an observable of the irreducible one. this is as f clearly veries
(1112). accordingly the ingredients of the antield-brst formalism, the
zeroth order cohomological groups corresponding to the reducible, respec-
tively, irreducible longitudinal exterior derivatives along the gauge orbits
coincide. in agreement with the homological perturbation theory [14][17],
the zeroth order cohomological groups associated with the reducible and ir-
reducible brst symmetries are equal. at the same time, the acyclicity
of the irreducible koszul-tate operator ensures the nilpotency of the corre-
sponding brst symmetry. these results make permissible from the physical
point of view, i.e., from the point of view of the requirements s2 = 0 and
h 0(s) = {observables}, the replacement of the brst quantization of the
reducible model with the one of the irreducible system constructed above.
h 0(s) denotes the zeroth order cohomological group of s.

although the cohomological groups of the longitudinal exterior deriva-
tives at pure ghost number zero coincide, this may not hold at superior
pure ghost numbers. indeed, in the irreducible case the higher order coho-
mological groups of d vanish as the ghosts are all d-exact. this can be
shown as follows for p even (the opposite situation is similar). we begin
with the last equation from the expressions of d acting on the elds, namely,
da = mc + , dh  = c + m + c . applying  on the latter

prior expression of c in the starting equations and applying  on the relation

and using the former, we nd c = d(cid:16)
expressing da, we derive  = d(cid:16)

+m 2 (h   ma)(cid:17). inserting the

along the same line, we output 1...p2k1 = d(cid:16)
+m 2 1...p2k2(cid:17) (with k = 0, . . . , a),
k = 0, . . . , d), and c 1...p2k2 = d(cid:16)
where 1...p2k1 = [1 a 2...p2k1] + mh 1...p2k1 + a1...p2k1, and
1...p2k2 = [1 h 2...p2k2]  ma1...p2k2 + h 1...p2k2. because
the ghosts are all d-closed, it results that any d-closed quantity with pure
ghost number greater than zero is a polynomial in the ghosts with coe-
cients which are gauge invariant functions. on the other hand, as all the
ghosts are d-exact, we have that any such d-closed quantity is also d-
exact, so all higher order cohomological groups of d vanish in the irreducible
case. in the reducible situation, however, not necessarily all the higher or-
der cohomological groups are trivial. the analysis of the cohomology of the
irreducible d clearly outlines that the functions 1...p2k1 and 1...p2k2
may be regarded as some purely gauge elds with the gauge transformations
1...p2k1 = ( + m 2) 1...p2k1, 1...p2k2 = 1...p2k2, so it is
natural to choose 1...p2k1 = 0 and 1...p2k2 = 0 like gauge conditions
(because they are in addition irreducible). hence, our formalism displays a
class of possible gauge conditions that can be used at the brst quantization
during the gauge-xing process.

we discussed before that it is legitimate to substitute the brst quantiza-
tion of the reducible theory with the quantization of the irreducible model. in
the sequel we pass to the antield-brst quantization of the irreducible sys-
tem. with the ghost and antield spectra introduced previously, we take the

non-minimal sector (cid:16)1...p2k1,  
k = 0, . . . , d and (cid:16) c 1...p2k2, c 

1...p2k1(cid:17), (cid:16)b1...p2k1, b

1...p2k2(cid:17), for

k = 0, . . . , a, with the bs, bs,  s and c s bosonic, with ghost number
zero, and the remaining elds fermionic, with ghost number minus one (the
ghost number is dierence between the pure ghost and antighost numbers).
consequently, the non-minimal solution of the master equation is given by

it is clear that action (13) possesses no residual gauge invariances. thus, we
succeeded in quantizing the model with abelian p- and (p  1)-form gauge
elds coupled through a stueckelberg-like term by employing an irreducible
treatment, which needs no ghosts of ghosts.

the results exposed here can be also applied to interacting theories. it
is known [18] that the consistent interactions of a given gauge theory can
be such that: (a) they do not change the original gauge transformations;
(b) they change the gauge transformations, but do not aict their gauge
algebra, or (c) they simultaneously change the gauge transformations, as
well as the gauge algebra. the case (a) can be directly approached within
the context of the procedure exposed in this paper. indeed, if we add to (1)

an interaction term si ha1...p, h1...p1i invariant under the original gauge

transformations, the previous analysis remains valid. the only modication
appears in relation with the denitions of  acting on the antields associated
with the original elds because the interaction term may add new pieces to
the eld equations. this fact, however, does not change in any way the prior
treatment as the noether identities of the interacting theory are same with
those of the model described by action (1). then, the resulting gauge-xed
action of the interacting system will be expressed by the right-hand side of

(13) to which one must add si ha1...p, h1...p1i. the more realistic cases

(b) and (c) (including the interactions that satisfy the durand-weinberg-
witten theorem) can be also approached in an irreducible manner, but in this

8

situation it is necessary to apply the technique of the consistent deformation
of the master equation [19]. this represents a separate matter, which will
be reported elsewhere. this completes our approach. we remark that in the
limit m = 0 our procedure leads to the irreducible quantization of a system
with free abelian p- and (p  1)-form gauge elds.

to conclude with, in this paper we proved that p-form gauge theories with
stueckelberg coupling can be consistently quantized within the irreducible
antield-brst formalism. the key point of our treatment consists in con-
structing an irreducible theory in a way that makes permissible the replace-
ment of the redundant brst quantization with the irreducible one. both
the irreducible koszul-tate operator and the longitudinal exterior derivative
have been explicitly built. the analysis of the longitudinal exterior deriva-
tive emphasizes some irreducible gauge conditions that can be used at the
gauge-xing procedure. finally, we mention that our results open a new
perspective for a cohomological approach to p-form gauge theories.
