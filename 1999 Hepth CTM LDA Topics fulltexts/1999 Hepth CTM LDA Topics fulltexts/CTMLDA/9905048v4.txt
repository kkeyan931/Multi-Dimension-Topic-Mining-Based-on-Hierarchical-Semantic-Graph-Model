abstract

the two-point green function of a local operator in cft corresponding to a massive
symmetric tensor eld on the ads background is computed in the framework of the
ads/cf t correspondence. the obtained two-point function is shown to coincide with
the two-point function of the graviton in the limit when the ads mass vanishes.

1 introduction

the ads/cft correspondence conjectured in [1] states that in the large n limit and at large
t hooft coupling  = g2
y m n the classical supergravity/m-theory on the anti-de sitter space
(ads) times a compact manifold is dual to a certain su(n) conformal gauge theory (cf t )
dened on the boundary of ads. one notable example of this correspondence being the duality
between d = 4, n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory and d = 10 type iib supergravity
theory on ads5  s5. the precise formulation of the conjecture was given in [2], [3] where
it was proposed to identify the generating functional for connected green functions of local
operators in cft with the on-shell value of the supergravity action under the restriction that
the supergravity elds satisfy the dirichlet conditions on the boundary of ads. recall that in
the standard representation of ads as an upper-half space x0 > 0, xk  r, k = 1, . . . d with
the metric

ds2 = gdxdx =

1
x2

0 (cid:16)dx0dx0 + dxidxi(cid:17) ,

the boundary includes the plane x0 = 0 as well as the point x0 = . since the boundary is
located innitely far away from any point in the interior the supergravity action is infrared
divergent and must be regularized. as was pointed out in [4] the consistent regularization
procedure (with respect to ward identities) requires one to shift the boundary of ads to
the surface in the interior dened by x0 = . then the dirichlet boundary value problem for
supergravity elds is properly dened and one can compute the on-shell value of the supergravity
action as a functional of the boundary elds. with the account of this regularization procedure
the standard formulation of the ads/cft correspondence assumes the form:

ho(x1)    o(xn)i = lim
0



1(x1)

  



n(xn)

alexey@mi.ras.ru

sonshell (1(x1), . . . , n(xn))|i(xi)=i(x0=,xi),

where xi are some points on the boundary of adsd+1, oi(xi) are gauge invariant composite
operators in cft and i(xi) are the corresponding supergravity elds. here we used the
convention in which the coordinates x of adsd+1 are split according to: x = (x0, x), so that
x  rd. the action sonshell is the sum of the bulk supergravity action and the boundary terms
necessary to make the ads/cft correspondence complete. the origin of these boundary terms
was elucidated in [5] where it was shown that they appear in passing from the hamiltonian
description of the bulk action to the lagrangian one.

the ads/cft correspondence has been tested by computing various two- and three-point
functions of local operators in d = 4, n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory on ads5.
in particular two-point functions corresponding to scalars [3] - [8], vectors [3], [4], [9], [10],
spinors [10] - [12], the rarita-schwinger eld [13] - [16], antisymmetric form elds [17] - [20]
and the graviton [5], [21], [22] were computed on the ads background. the only eld in the
supergravity spectrum, found in [23], that has evaded the attention is the massive symmetric
second-rank tensor eld. in this paper we ll in the gap by computing the remaining two-point
green function.

we note that the dirichlet boundary value problem for the massive symmetric tensor eld
is nontrivial due to the fact that the equations of motion for various components are coupled.
furthermore, in computing the two-point green function we have to stick with the regular-
ization procedure described above in order to obtain the consistent result. at the end of our
computation we nd that in the limit when the ads mass vanishes the correlation function
reduces to that of the massless symmetric tensor eld, i.e. the graviton.

2 equations of motion

the starting point in the calculation is the action for the symmetric second-rank tensor  on
adsd+1 [24]1:

(2.1)

where g is the determinant of the ads metric g. the action (2.1) leads to the following
equations of motion ([23], [24])



 = 0,

 + (2  m2)
 = 0.



 = 0,

(2.2)
(2.3)

the massive terms in (2.1) destroy the standard symmetry:  =  + , which is
present in the case of the massless symmetric tensor eld. as a result of this symmetry breaking
one can no longer perform gauge xing. since 
 is traceless, we can eliminate the component
0 from the equations of motion by using the constraint 0
0
i = 0. let us introduce a concise
notation:

0 + i

 = i

i, i = i

0,  = ii.

1note that the ads background satises restriction (10) of [24] and also to simplify our calculations we set

the parameter  of [24] equal to 1.

then starting from (2.2),(2.3) one can obtain the following system of coupled dierential equa-
tions

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

here eq.(2.6) corresponds to  =  = 0 in (2.2) while eqs.(2.4) and (2.5) follow from (2.3). to
simplify the notation, we chose the convention in which indices are raised and lowered with the
at metric  = x2
0 g so that, in particular, 2 = . the fourier mode for the eld 
vanishing at x0   is given by:

(x0, k) = a(, k)x

d

2 +2
0 k(kx0).

here k = |k|,

and k is a modied bessel functions [25]:

k(z) =

sin 

,

i(z) =



xk=0

1

k!( + k + 1)(cid:18)z

2(cid:19)+2k

(2.7)

.

recall that the modied bessel function satises the recurrence relations [25]:

k+1(z)  k1(z) =

2
z

k(z)

, k+1(z) + k1(z) = 2

d

k(z).

(2.8)

by dierentiating (2.5) with respect to xi and using (2.4) and (2.6) one gets:

iji

j =  d  1

x0

(d  1)(d + 2) + m2

(2.9)

from (2.7) and (2.9) we can easily deduce the fourier mode solution for the eld

(x0, k)  kikji

j(x0, k) =

d

0  (d  1)(x0k)k+1(x0k) +(cid:16) (  1) + (x0k)2(cid:17) k(x0k)!,

where recurrence formulae (2.8) were used. here we introduced a concise notation

 =

d
2

+ =

taking the ratio of  and  at x0 =  results in the following relation

(k) = 2 (d  1)(k)k+1(k) + ((  1) + (k)2) k(k)

k(k)

(k),

where (k) = (, k) and, similarly for other elds. in the limit   0, (k)  2(k) and
therefore if we keep (k) nite as   0, then (k) will tend to zero. on the other hand,
keeping (k) nite leads to the divergence of (k). consequently, we ought to x  at x0 = .
thus we have:

(x0, k) =

(x0, k) =

(k).

(2.10)

(2.11)

the fourier mode solution for the eld  is found by substituting (2.10) into (2.4):

(2.12)

where once again recurrence formulae (2.8) were used. next we turn our attention to the eld
i. here we need to use equation

(2.13)

which follows from (i0)-component of (2.2) by taking into account (2.5). now we decompose
i into the transversal and longitudinal parts:

rewriting (2.5) and (2.13) for the transversal part of i leads to:

to nd bi(, k) substitute (2.17) into (2.15) to obtain the following formula

using the same arguments as before one nds that in order to avoid the divergence at   0
the solutions for the eld

where we introduced a concise notation: k(z) = zk(z).

3 two-point green function

to compute the green function in the framework of the ads/cf t correspondence we need to
evaluate the on-shell value of the action. taking into account equations of motion (2.2) and
(2.3) one nds that the on-shell value of (2.1) is

sonshell =

82 zx0=

i  0 + 2  2kii

2(d + 1)



(cid:16)2 + kk(cid:17)! .

let us rst consider the contribution to sonshell that depends locally on boundary elds, i.e.
does not contain the normal derivative 0. we expect that such terms do not contribute to the
non-local part of sonshell. so we need to consider the behavior of  and k on the boundary
of ads. to this end we note that according to (2.10) the eld (k) is local since

(d  1)(k)k+1(k) + ((  1) + (k)2) k(k)

k(k)

=

1

+(+  1)

+ o(2k2),

while expanding solution (2.26) in  gives:

i(k) = (i)" 1

k2 (k)# + local.

(3.1)

here we included only non-local terms.
expansion of the modied bessel function [25]:

in deriving (3.1) use was made of the power series

k(z) = 21() 1 +

z2

4(1  )

+ . . .! ,

(3.2)

6

where ellipsis indicate terms of order z4 and higher which evidently lead to local expressions as
well as terms of order z2+2 which will become negligible in the limit   0. from expression
(3.1) it follows that i(k) is a local eld. consequently, the terms in (3.1) that depend only
on the value of elds at the boundary do not contribute to the non-local part of sonshell as we
expected.

next we consider terms with the normal derivative 0. in evaluating such terms it is useful

to employ the following identity

d

dx0  (cid:18)x0

f (k) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x0=
 (cid:19) f (x0k)

=

k


d
dk

ln f (k).

(3.3)

taking into account solution (2.10), identity (3.3) and expansion (3.2) we nd that 0(, x) is
equal to

0(, x) = z

ddk

(2)d eikx(cid:18)2 + 



+ o(k2)(cid:19) 2 

1

+(+  1)

+ o(2k2)! (k).

clearly 0 is a local expression and therefore does not contribute to the non-local part of
sonshell. consequently, the non-local part is entirely determined by the following expression

d+1

82 zx0=

ddx j

i (x)z

ddk

(2)d eikx(cid:16)0i

j(x0, k)(cid:17).

(3.4)

taking into account solution (2.25), identity (3.3) and expansion (3.2) we see that the expression
for 0i
j gets three dierent contributions: the rst contribution comes from dierentiating the
ratio x0
 raised to the power  or (2 + ); the second contribution comes from o(k2) terms
in the power expansion of the logarithmic derivative of various functions in (2.25) and the third
contribution comes from o(21k2) terms in the same expansion. from (2.25) we can easily
read o the rst contribution which is equal to

leading to a purely local expression which does not contribute to the non-local part of sonshell.

in the process of deriving (3.7) we dropped all terms containing i
in the limit   0. to understand why this is so, note that when i
from (3.4) it gives the trace of i

j(x) which according to (2.10) is order o(2) at x0 = .
now putting together (3.4) and (3.7) we arrive at the following formula for sonshell
