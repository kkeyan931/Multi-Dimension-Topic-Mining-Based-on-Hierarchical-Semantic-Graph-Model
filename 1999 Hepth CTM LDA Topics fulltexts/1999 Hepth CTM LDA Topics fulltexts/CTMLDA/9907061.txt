(7) so(32) symmetry group broken wilson lines subgroup commutes wilson line matrix. terms type description gives following rules: n d8-branes coincide interior interval, corre- sponds unbroken u(n) gauge group. n d8-branes coincide o8-plane give unbroken so(2n) gauge group. cases gauge bosons arise zero modes 8 8 open strings. second case mirror-image d8-branes also contribute. explain 5 later, whole story. symmetry enhancement arise ways. case trivial wilson line (all ai = 0) corresponds 16 d8-branes (and mirror images) coincide one d8-branes. gives so(32) gauge symmetry, course. addition two u(1) factors. corresponding gauge elds arise components 10d metric b eld: g9 b9. one combination belongs 9d supergravity multiplet, whereas combination belongs 9d vector supermultiplet. somewhat generally, consider wilson line (cid:18) i16+2n 0 0 i162n (cid:19) . (8) corresponds 8 + n d8-branes coincide o8-plane x = 0 8 n d8-branes o8-plane x = r. generically gives rise gauge symmetry so(16 + 2n ) so(16 2n ) u (1)2. (9) however, s-dual heterotic description type theory, one knows particular value radius symmetry enhancement possible. specically, heterotic radius r2 h = n/8 one nds gauge symmetry enhancement so(16 2n ) u (1) e9n . (10) radius, converted type metric, corresponds r2 = gn/8. symmetry enhancement explained type viewpoint later. interesting extended symmetries su(18) so(34), might also understood type viewpoint, considered here. 5 d0-branes type theory constructed type iia orientifold. such, bulk physics away orientifold planes essentially type iia theory. precisely, number distinct type iia vacua distin- guished dierence number d8-branes left right. numbers match, one ordinary iia vacuum. dont one massive iia vacuum kind rst considered romans.10 case, ordinary iia vacuum admits various even-dimensional d- branes. wish focus d0-branes. later discuss happens 6 cross d8-brane enter region dierent iia vacuum. d0-branes type theory correspond type d-strings wrap compactication circle. wilson line d-strings controls positions dual d0-branes. collection n coincident type 1 d-strings o(n) world-volume gauge symmetry. unlike case d9-branes reection element included, group really o(n) so(n). means case single string o(1) = z2. thus case two possible values wilson line (1). dual type description single d0-brane stuck one orientifold planes, value wilson line controlling one is. single d0-brane type stuck orientifold-plane cannot move plane bulk. however, pair so. understand this, let us consider pair wrapped strings type i, coincident dimensions, carries o(2) gauge symmetry. again, dual pair type d0-branes positions controlled choice o(2) wilson line. inequivalent choices wilson line classied conjugacy classes o(2) gauge group. recall are. important o(2), unlike so(2) subgroup, non-abelian. correspondingly, conjugacy classes two types: so(2) subgroup classes labeled angle . including eect reection, inequivalent classes correspond range 0 . conjugacy class describes d0-brane x = r bulk, together mirror image x = (2 )r. see move bulk second (mirror image) d0-brane provided. reection elements o(2) belong conjugacy class. representative matrix (cid:18) 1 0 1 (cid:19). class corresponds 0 one stuck d0-brane o8-plane. 6 brane creation solutions massive type iia supergravity investigated polchinski witten,11 showed involve metric dilaton vary one direction. context type theory means vary regions number d8-branes left right unequal. thus case eect occur so(16) so(16) conguration d8-branes attached o8- planes. (this case closely related theory description e8 e8 theory.12) 7 avoid describing x dependence metric explicitly using proper distance coordinate along interval. (this requires holding coordinates xed.) one 0 r, r = 1/r. didnt address issue earlier, said interval length r really mean proper distance. terms coordinate varying dilaton eld, hence varying string coupling constant ga(s). regions half d8-branes left half right constant. function ga(s) obtained polchinski witten solving eld equations. instructive way obtaining understanding result uses brane creation process. consider isolated d0-brane region ga(s) constant. suppose d0-brane crosses d8- brane enter region ga(s) varying. happens d0- brane emerges side fundamental string stretched d8-brane. phenomenon, called hananywitten eect,13 derived variety means.14 occurs many dierent settings related various duality transformations. (for example, two suitably oriented m5-branes cross give rise stretched m2-brane.15) intuitive reason string creation required understood follows. original d0-brane conguration preserved half supersymmetry bps. therefore delicate balance focus ensured stable rest. crosses d8-brane (adiabatically) amount supersymmetry remains unchanged still stable rest. specic, let us consider d8-brane conguration discussed earlier 8 + n d8-branes x = 0 o8-plane 8 n d8-branes x = r o8-plane. case n fundamental strings connect d0-brane x = 0 o8-plane. bps condition implies mass d0-brane independent position interval. recalling mass type iia d0-brane 1/ga, therefore conclude conguration md0 = 1 ga(0) = 1 ga(s) + n tf 1s. (11) tf 1 = 1 2 tension fundamental type iia string (in string units). therefore see ga(s) reciprocal linear function whenever n 6= 0. thus, n 6= 0 necessarily develops pole r large. mass md0 also computed type picture terms pair wrapped strings wilson line. mass independent o(2) wilson line, since independent x coordinate. however, depend so(32) wilson line. altogether mass sum two 8 contributions: winding term contribution given simple classical considerations: md0 = mwinding + mwilson. (12) mwinding = 2 2r td1 = 2r g . (13) careful analysis required obtain wilson line contribution mwilson = n 4r . (14) note contribution vanishes large r. come main point. special value r, one coupling diverges x = r orientifold plane. case 1 ga(r) = 0, implies, using eq. (11), hence md0 = n 2r = 2r g + n 4r , r2 = gn/8. (15) (16) (17) precisely value previously asserted gives symmetry enhancement so(162n ) u(1) e9n . reason symmetry enhancement additional massless vectors appropriate quantum numbers. arise ground states open strings connecting d8-branes stuck d0-brane.16,17 works stuck d0-brane massless case, consequence eq.
