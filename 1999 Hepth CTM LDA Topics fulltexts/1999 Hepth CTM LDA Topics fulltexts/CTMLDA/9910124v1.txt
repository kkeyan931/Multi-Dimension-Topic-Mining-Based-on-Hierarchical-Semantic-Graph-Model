abstract

counterterm actions for regularizing gravitational action on non-compact

spaces are studied in evaluating the action value on boundaries. it is shown

that the boundary action value, so the counterterm action, always can be writ-

ten as an integration form of intrinsic boundary geometry. we consider some

examples and show that our expression of counterterm action reproduces pre-

vious results. we discuss about the relationship between counterterm actions

for asymptotically ads and at. using this description, we also discuss about

the holographic anomaly. for asymptotic ads spaces, restricting the bound-

ary geometry, we obtain an arbitrary (even) dimensional holographic anomaly.

interestingly, we also show that for an asymptotically at space, the boundary

action value has a logarithmically divergent term, and corresponding conformal

anomaly is obtained. according to this anomaly, descriptions and applications

are briey discussed.

1 introduction

there has been a typical problem to dene a gravitational action suering from

divergence in a non-compact space.

in spite that several prescriptions within the

concept of reference space have been suggested so far [1][2][3], those are awed by

the fact although the divergences could be eliminated by choosing an appropriate

reference space, it is impossible to embed a boundary with an arbitrary geometry.

another drawback of the reference space method is that dierent reference spaces are

needed for dierent boundary geometries, so that one cannot dene relative energies

in a consistent manner.

recently, a prominent prescription has been suggested [4] in context of ads/cft

correspondence [5][6][7]. according to the correspondence, the uv divergences of

quantum eld theory living on the boundary of ads space are derived from the ir

divergences of the bulk theory. so, the bulk action could be regularized by adding

local counterterms [6][8]. for asymptotically ads spaces, this approach gives an

elegant expression of counterterm action in the form of the expansion for ads radius

 [4][9][10][11]

in case of even dimensional boundary, however, one encounters a logarithmic diver-

gent term in evaluating the bulk action functional. what one takes the counterterm

action involving this log term to render the action nite may produce problematic

results in calculating the boundary stress energy [10]. even though this appearance

of the logarithmic divergent term embarrasses the counterterm subtraction approach

to dene a nite regularized action, it provides a remarkable consistency check of

the ads/cft correspondence [6][8]. the conformal anomaly for d-dimensional con-

formal eld theories in coupling to background gravity comes from logarithmic uv

divergences [12]. thus, to evaluate the conformal anomaly in this scheme becomes a

nontrivial check of the uv-ir connection [13] of the ads/cft correspondence.

in more systematic scheme, the counterterm action of eq.(1) has been also con-

structed from the gauss-codazzi equations through an iterative process [11]. the

2

authors investigated counterterm actions for asymptotically at (af) spaces as well.

unfortunately, the procedure adapted for ads spaces could not be simply generalized

on af spaces because of a mathematical diculty due to non-linearity of the gauss-

codazzi equations. taking an alternative approach, they obtained a counterterm
action for af spaces with sdn  rn boundary geometries

very recently, a dierent prescription to construct the counterterm action has been

suggested [14]. in the prescription, a length dimensional parameter analogue to the

radius of ads space was dened, so that the counterterm actions for asymptotically

at and ads spaces could be consistently constructed in the expansion for the dened

length parameter.

the authors of ref.[11] considered an interesting example of spaces with nontriv-

ial boundary geometry that is the d-dimensional generalization of the kerr metric

[15] setting the mass parameter to zero. it is the metric of af space in spheroidal
coordinates. they have shown that for d  6 the counterterm action in (2) can
not eliminate all divergent terms. in the procedure, the full einstein equations were

used in evaluating the action value on the boundary. however, since the countert-

erm action is given by a surface integral on the boundary, one has to calculate the

boundary action value in which the boundary integral still remains. thus, on action

level, only the equation that is obtained by projecting the einstein equations on the

boundary in normal directions, must be used. in fact, for spaces with simple bound-

ary geometries, it does not matter whether another equations, tangential-tangential

and tangential-normal projection equations of the einstein equations, are used or not,

because they are trivial or dummy in deriving the counterterm action. however, on

nontrivial boundary geometries, what one uses the full einstein equations is to get

an over-constrained boundary action value (bav). on the above example, we shall

show that there are missing terms in the bav comparing with the evaluation of the

ref.[11], and the missing terms produces logarithmic divergence in even dimensional

boundaries. it is very interesting result, because according to the holographic princi-

ple [16][17], it can be identied with the uv logarithmic divergences of the boundary

theory that is related to the conformal anomaly.

3

the rst step of the process will be given by evaluation of the bav with only

the normal-normal projection equation. then, we will show that the bav, so the

counterterm action, always can be written by intrinsic geometry of a boundary. from

this expression of the counterterm action, we obtain some valuable results. in fact,

concerning the variety of the boundary geometries, the expression of the counterterm

action in (1) is very elegant one. however, for higher dimensions, its evaluation is not

manageable. in this paper, restricting our concern to simple boundary geometry, we

obtain the counterterm action available for any d-dimensional boundary. from this

expression, we derive arbitrary dimensional (holographic) anomaly.

our paper is organized as follows; in sect.2, counterterm action is formulated as

an integration form. examples for asymptotic ads spaces are considered in sect.3; a

counterterm action for asymptotic ads space with sd boundary is constructed. from

this example, arbitrary dimensional conformal anomaly is obtained. in sect.4, the

relationship between the counterterm actions for asymptotic ads and at spaces is

discussed. for af space in spheroidal coordinates, the bav and counterterm action is

evaluated. from this, holographic anomaly is obtained and according to the results,

some speculations will be given given. discussions and summary are contained in

sect.5.

2 holographic counterterm actions

(d + 1)-dimensional gravitational action with cosmological constant  = d(d 
1)/(22) is given by

s =

(3)

where gab is boundary metric and  is the trace of extrinsic curvature of d-dimensional
timelike boundary x dened by ab = g
anb.  denotes the covariant derivative
on (d + 1)-dimensional manifold x and n is an outward unit normal to the boundary

x. the boundary term in eq.(3), so called gibbons-hawking term, is required for

well dened variational principle.

our purpose is to add another proper surface integral to the action in (3), so

that the action becomes nite in the limit that the boundary is taken to innity.

4

according to the counterterm subtraction approach, the integrand of the additional

surface integral must be given by the inverse sign of the divergent terms of the bav.

in addition, it must be given by a functional of intrinsic boundary geometry. for

the procedure, we take the adm formulation as a guide line for construction of the

counterterm action. as it will seen in the following, the adm formulation guarantees

to extract the intrinsic boundary geometries from the action (3).

to rewrite the action (3) in a canonical form, we rst take a metric given by

gdxdx = n 2d2 + gabdxadxb,

(4)

where n 2 = n 2() and g = g(, xa). on this coordinate system, the unit normal to
the boundary is given by n = n

. then, following the standard adm formalism,

the canonical form of the action (3) is

dd+1x(abg 

s =zx
ab is the momentum density conjugate to gab and  denotes the

ab  nh) zx

dd+1xl,

where ab = l/g

(cid:19) ,

(6)

where r is the d-dimensional scalar curvature of the boundary. the equation h = 0
generates reparametrization of space coordinate . in fact, this equation one of the

gauss-codazzi equations that is dened by projecting the einstein equations on the

boundary in normal directions.

using the constraint equation h = 0, the bav evaluated from the action in (3)

on the boundary  = 0 is given by a simple form as

(7)

so, according to the counterterm subtraction approach, regularized action (ra), sra,

is dened by

where the counterterm action s is given by

sra  s  s,

s = zx

ddxdiv (a(xa; 0))  zx

ddxg0 adiv(xa; 0),

5

(8)

(9)

where div means to pick divergent terms after -integration and g0 is the induced

metric on the boundary.

in fact, the expression for the counterterm action (9) still contains an integration

of a space coordinate  in the functional a that must be evaluated in case-by-case.

however, from the expression of the counterterm action, we nd two important things

in our investigation. one is that the integrand of the counterterm action in eq.(9)
is to be a functional of the intrinsic boundary geometry, because a(xa; 0) in eq.(7)

is the functional of the intrinsic boundary geometry. (the lapse function n can be

eliminated by a redenition of the space coordinate .) in fact, the divergent terms

in bav is given from the gibbons-hawking term that is the surface integral of the

extrinsic curvature, as well as from the bulk terms. of course, it has been shown

that the divergent terms of the gibbons-hawking term can be described by intrinsic

boundary geometry in some examples [11]. in the above procedure, it can be seen

very clearly. the extrinsic term is canceled by a term extracted from the bulk term,

and the whole divergent structure of the bav in (7) is given by only the bulk term

written by the intrinsic boundary geometry.

on the other hand, it must be also noted that in the above procedure, we did not

use the full einsteins equation to obtain the bav, but only the constraint equation,
h = 0, was used. this means that in the bav in (7), degrees of freedom inherited
on the boundary still remain without xing it. what one uses another gauss-codazzi

equations is to lead to an over-constrained bav. in section 4, it will be seen that this

notion leads to a very interesting result.

3 ads space and holographic anomaly

the counterterm action for asymptotic ads spaces in (1) is useful for various bound-

ary geometries. however, counterterm action for higher dimensional boundary is not

easy to evaluate because of its mathematical complexity. if one restricts the bound-

ary geometry to simple one, this complexity properly disappears. as an example, we

consider the euclidean ads space with sd boundary described by the line element

the counterterm action for this asymptotic space can be constructed by evaluating

the functional a in eq.(7) for the metric (10)

spaces with sd boundary is given by a polynomial in the boundary scalar curvature

after simple algebraic calculation using the relation rabrab = r2/d, it can be

shown that the counterterm action in (14) is equivalent to the eq.(1). in other words,

the counterterm action in (1) can be written by a polynomial in the boundary scalar

curvature r for the ads spaces with sd boundary and in the case, d-dimensional

counterterms are determined by the terms in eqs.(15) or (16).

it must be also noted that since we take the counterterm action (14) as a polyno-

mial in the d-dimensional scalar curvature r, in d = even case, the counterterm action

of eq.(14) fails on eliminating all divergent terms appearing in the bav, instead the

ra contains a logarithmically divergent term

(17)

it has been already understood in the context of the ads/cft correspondence [6][8];

the regularization of bav by introducing local counterterms may break conformal

invariance and ra is left with a conformal anomaly for boundary cft. according

to this prescription, we derive (holographic) conformal anomaly for which the dual

cft is coupled to the background gravity with sd boundary. considering a scale

transformation r = r for an innitesimal constant parameter , the conformal
invariance is broken by the conformal anomaly a

the conformal anomaly in arbitrary dimensions has been given in geometric descrip-

expression of the conformal anomaly in arbitrary dimensions.

for s2 boundary, the eq.(18) recovers well known result

(19)

comparing the (1 + 1)-dimensional anomaly on a surface of radius , 1/(8g) =
c/(122), the central charge c becomes 3/(2g). from the eq.(18) for d = 4, we
nd that the conformal anomaly agrees with that of ref.[8]

(20)

the conformal anomaly for n = 4 super yang-mill theory on s4 is 3n 2/(824).
comparing with the anomaly on this boundary from the eq.(20), 3/(16g), we

obtain the expected result

n 2 =

2g

,

(21)

where n is the rank of the gauge group of the dual n = 4 supersymmetric d = 4
su(n) ym theory. at last, it can be seen that for six dimensional boundary, the

anomaly in (18) is equivalent to that of [8]

(22)

in fact, since we are concerned about s6 boundary, the terms in third line including

derivatives vanish. on the other hand, eq.(22) can be veried by considering the

central charge of n coincident m5-branes in the large n limit. it has been shown

that the central charge is proportional to n 3 [19]. so, the anomaly on s6 boundary

with radius , 15/(64g), is proportional to n 3/(46). thus, we nd [5]

(23)

before ending of this section, it is useful on following process to consider another

euclidean ads space with dierent boundary geometry, sd1  s1,

ds2 =(cid:18)1 +

r2

2(cid:19) d 2 +(cid:18)1 +

r2

2(cid:19)1

dr2 + r2d2

d1 .

(24)

on this metric, the functional a in (7) is given by

a(xa; r0) =

8g (cid:18)d  1

2 (cid:19)(cid:18)(d  1)(d  2)

r

(cid:19)d/2(cid:18)1 +

2r

(d  1)(d  2)(cid:19) .

(25)

9

since all terms in expanding of eq.(25) are divergent for d > 2, the counterterm

action is just the negative of scl in (7) [11]

s =

1

8gzx

ddxg0(cid:18)d  1

 (cid:19)(cid:18)1 +

2r

(d  1)(d  2)(cid:19)1/2

.

(26)

it could be shown that using rabrab = r2/(d1) and expanding for , the counterterm
action in (26) is equivalent to eq.(1). however, it must be noted that while the

counterterm action for sd boundary is given by a nite sum of the series in (1), for
sd1  s1 boundary it is given by an innite sum. as mentioned in ref.[11], in the
process the divergent factors 1/(d 4), 1/(d 6),    in (1) are canceled. thus, while
conformal invariance of the ra for sd boundary is broken by the anomaly in (18),
that for the sd1  s1 is still conformal invariant.

4 af space and holographic anomaly

now, consider the counterterm action for asymptotic at spaces. those are simply
obtained by taking the limit of    on the functional as

in (25). in eqs.(27) and (28), the counterterm actions were written in the lorentzian

signature. in more useful expression, the counterterm actions in (27) and (28) can be

written by [11]

s =

(29)

in fact, the counterterm action in (29) is somewhat general expression which is avail-
able for the af spaces with sdn  rn boundary geometries described by the metric

(32)

in the above evaluation, it must be noted that the counterterm action for af

spaces is not a limitation of the counterterm action for the asymptotic ads spaces. in

other words, the counterterm action for the two dierent asymptotic spaces (at and

ads) are derived by taking dierent limitations on the bav in (7) respectively. so,

there is not any reasonable relationship between themselves without passing through

the bav. (in ref.[14], the author has taken a new expanding parameter that varies

on dierent boundary geometry.)

now, consider an af space in spheroidal coordinates that was investigated in

ref.[11]

metric in (33) does not describe the asymptotic spacetime of the kerr black hole in

(34). because, in the process, one is to meet a naked singularity. it is just the at

spacetime metric of n = 1 in eq.(30) written in spheroidal coordinates.

as shown in ref.[11], the counterterm action (29) for the metric (33) can not

properly eliminate the divergent terms appearing in bav. now, using the eq.(31),

we calculate the counterterm action for the metric in (33). the d-dimensional scalar

curvature r on the metric is

r =

of course, since our procedure to determine the counterterm action is just to take

the divergent terms of the bav and to impose inverse sign, the counterterm action

of eq.(39) exactly cancels the divergent terms in bav for arbitrary dimensions.

of the action (3). however, it leads to over-constrained bav in the case of nontrivial

boundary geometries, e.g., the metric in (33). as seen in the section 2, the bav is

obtained by using only the normal-normal projection equation of the gauss-codazzi
equations, h = 0.

on the other hand, there is another interesting outcome in the bav (36); in the
case of even dimensional boundaries of d  4, it contains a logarithmic divergent
term. so, the conformal invariance of the ra is broken by a conformal anomaly

we can see that setting a = 0, the anomaly (41) vanishes. this means that the

anomaly is due to a nontrivial slicing of the space. in the metric (33), if we take the

limit of r0 >> a, then, the metric becomes

gdxdx = dt2 + dr2 + r2d2 + r2 sin2 d2 + r2 cos2 d2

d3.

(42)

this metric describes the asymptotic space of the black hole (34). for this asymptotic

spacetime, the anomaly (41) manifestly disappears. however, as mentioned above,

the constant a in (33) cannot be interpreted by the angular momentum of the black

hole. then, the metric (33) does not describe the (quasi-) asymptotic spacetime of

the black hole. the constant a is a proper characteristic parameter of the metric

(33). thus, taking the asymptotic spacetime of the metric (33), the anomaly (41) is

inevitable.

the appearance of the anomaly in (41) is very interesting. because, in holographic

sense, if one nds a cft corresponding to the anomaly (41), the gravity theory could

be identied with the cft. as an example, consider ve-dimensional spacetime of
(33). then, the conformal anomaly, af lat

comparing with the case of the ads space (20), we see that as expected, r0 plays

the same role of . however, as well known, the r term can be eliminated by

a cft corresponding to the anomaly subtracting the r term in (43).

5 summary and discussions

the counterterm subtracting method to dene a nite gravitational action on non-

compact spacetime has been speculated in a direct scheme. it has been shown that the

bav in (7) can be always written by a surface integral of a functional of the intrinsic

geometric terms of the boundary. so, the counterterm action constructed from the

bav becomes naturally a surface integral of a intrinsic functional of the boundary

geometry. on the other hand, restricting the boundary geometry as sd, we have

obtained an expression of the counterterm action available for arbitrary dimensional

spaces in (14), (15), and (16). according to this expression, the arbitrary dimensional

conformal anomaly has been obtained.

we have also considered the relationship between the counterterm actions for

asymptotic at and ads spaces. in this concern, it has been shown that countert-

erm actions for the two dierent asymptotic spaces are derived by taking dierent

limitations in the bav in (7). so, there is not any reasonable relationship between

themselves without passing through the bav. recently, solodukhin [14] has shown

that introducing a new expansion parameter instead of , the counterterm actions

could be constructed in a consistent manner. this newly dened parameter varies on

dierent boundary geometries and becomes  on asymptotic ads spaces.

the expression of the counterterm action in (9) is not an elegant one. but it

is helpful to evade from a trap of over-constrained bav. we have shown that for

a nontrivial boundary geometry, what one use the full einstein equation may lead

to the over-constrained bav. from this observation, it has been shown that for the

asymptotic spacetime of the metric (33), ra has a logarithmic divergence term in

an even dimensional boundary. thus, the ra is broken by the anomaly (41). it was

discussed that the anomaly is inevitable in taking the asymptotic space of the metric

(33). however, the corresponding cft could not be found.

recently, at-space s-matrix has been studied on the large radius limit in the

ads/cft correspondence [20][21]. this approach has been suered from a non-

14

local holographic mapping. according to the investigation in this paper, it appears

that the investigation of the at-space scattering could be understood on alternative

holographic mapping that is dierent from the ads/cft. in order words, there might

be an alternative corresponding chain in which a gravity theory on asymptotically at

is identied with a cft.
