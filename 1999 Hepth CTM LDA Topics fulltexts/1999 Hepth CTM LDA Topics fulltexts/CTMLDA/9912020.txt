(4) provides formal proof equivalence w  two sets gauges, shall also provided reasonably brief proof statement o(g4). utilize work cheng tsai  order shorten argument. note propagator  fact general form used cheng tsai : = k2 + (g ak bk), (6) a(k) = b(k) bose symmetry. cheng tsai  prove equivalence wilson loops two gauges introducing eective ghost- ghost-gluon vertex: g(k) = k k2a(k)] k2 + (7) (which includes propagator outgoing ghost). entire proof equivalence wilson loops lorentz axial-type gauges would go through, fact treatment ghost well gluon propagator arise rather eective action sa e. con- sequently, results  would imply equivalence wilson loop two sets gauges (axial lorentz) o(g4) veried could 3 show two treatments ghosts make dierence order. sake brevity, refer reader diagrams (fig. 1) . shall prove desired result simply showing (only) one diagram required considered calculation fact vanishes loops 2 < 0 fact vanishes large class loops 2 > 0. diagram o(g4) relevant diagram 1(b)  diagram two ends gluon propagator ghost-loop self-energy insertion. entire propagator diagram (with two gluon propagators) structure: g(p, ) = app + bp + cp + (8) a, b, c functions p2, p (and also depend 2). whole contribution diagram wilson loop form: w  z d4pi dx dyeip(xy)g(p, ). (9) shall give simple argument loops rst three terms (8) contribute (9). note contribution rst two terms (9) form w  = z d4pi dx dyeip(xy)p a(p2, p) could re-expressed as: w  = z d4p a(p2, p)i dyeipy dxpeipx = z d4p a(p2, p)i dyeipy dx(i)eipx. now, xed p y, evaluate dx(eipx) (10) (11) (12) along loop nd vanishes. similar argument applies third term: evaluate h dypeipy rst. consider contribution last term. reads w  z d4pil dxeipx il dyeipyd(p2, p, 2).

(14) now, (14) would vanish planar loop could choose = perpendicular loop l ( dx = 0). investigate possible planar loop l. plane loop described (not necessarily uniquely) intersection ax = bx = b. (15) (i) let 2 < 0. note least one a, b c (a a0 b0 b) (with b0 6= 0) necessarily spacelike. pick space-like vector three call n. 2 < 0, always choose parallel n. evidently, since d(n x) = 0, dx = 0 l (14) vanishes. (ii) let 2 > 0. suppose possible construct time-like vector linear combinations b. then, call n orient parallel n. argument proceeds above. evidently, argument case, hold planar loops time-like normal exist. (iii) let 2 = 0. (a b)2 > a2b2, real exists + b light-like. case, choose n = + b argument proceeds before. argument fact applies loops general planar loop. example, 2 < 0, argument applies loop conned 3-dimensional subspace normal space-like vector. argument easily extends arbitrary loop 2 < 0 subclass arbitrary loops 2 0. close loop surface cover patchwork n planar loops (we might require 5 limit n given loop). write w  = htrt p exp(cid:18)il adx(cid:19)i = htrt p exp(cid:18) n xi=1 ici adx(cid:19)i. (16) relevant o(g4) contribution w  ghost diagrams comes quadratic terms expansion exponent, path ordering immaterial since tr(t b) = tr(t bta). typical term (apart overall coecient) reads ici dx icj dyg(x, y). (17) apply arguments following equation (8) typical term. so, shall come across contribution analogous (14). term, need choose perpendicular one two loops ci cj. entire argument goes term (i, j) separately, provided always chosen normal one loops1. shown earlier, always possible 2 < 0. 2 0, hold subclass loops. also note o(g2) thermal wilson loop considered  given by: wr = 1 + (n 2 c 1)g2 2nct z d3k (2)3 d00(k0 = 0, ~k) (18) thus depends d00(k0 = 0, ~k). nd propagator k2+i d00(k0 = 0, ~k) , d00(k0 = 0, ~k) = g00 lorentz gauges wr value lorentz-type gauges. summarize, emphasized treatment given axial gauge poles  construction, compatible preservation wilson loop orders. given 1the argument fact assumes argument applies separately term (i, j). seen follows: let arbitrary closed loop l broken sum two arbitrary closed loops l1 l2. w  broken w  = w  + w  + w . here, w  depends loops. entire argument cheng tsai argument gave independence direction applies w , w  w  therefore w . argument easily extended case l broken n loops. hence etc. 6 proof statement o(g4) using earlier work cheng tsai. proof holds arbitrary loop 2 < 0 subclass loops 2 0. also noted preservation thermal wilson loop o(g2) treatment. acknowledgement authors thank dr.m.lavelle communication. references  see example
