abstract

spin-5/2 gauge elds are quantized in an irreducible way within
both the brst and brst-anti-brst manners. to this end, we
transform the reducible generating set into an irreducible one, such
that the physical observables corresponding to these two formulations
coincide. the gauge-xing procedure emphasizes on the one hand the
dierences among our procedure and the results obtained in the liter-
ature, and on the other hand the equivalence between our brst and
brst-anti-brst approaches.

1 introduction

the power of the antield brst formalism [1]-[5] has been fully proved
lately. this approach can be applied to both irreducible and reducible the-
ories. a more symmetrical treatment is given by the antield brst-anti-
brst method [6]-[16]. although less important than the brst symmetry,
the brst-anti-brst procedure helps at a correct understanding of the non-
minimal sector. the non-minimal variables are particularly important when

dealing with redundant systems, being required during the gauge-xing pro-
cess. a typical class of reducible models are free massless higher spin gauge
elds [17]-[28]. such theories are important due to their connection with
string theory, and, because of their remarkable gauge symmetries, they are
promising candidates for building a unied physical theory.
in the mean-
time, the existence of a large class of nontrivial interacting higher spin gauge
theories [29], at least in four dimensions, reveal the necessity of investigating
this type of models.

in this paper we quantize free massless spin-5/2 gauge elds. although
rst-stage reducible, we show that this model can be consistently approached
in an irreducible manner following both antield brst and brst-anti-
brst lines. as far as we know, there has not been published such a proce-
dure. our analysis mainly consists in: (i) replacing the reducible generating
set of the original gauge symmetries with an irreducible one, and (ii) quantiz-
ing the irreducible theory. the irreducible model is obtained by introducing
a spin-1/2 gauge eld such that the physical observables arising from the
reducible, respectively, irreducible situation are the same. we mention that
the idea of replacing the reducible symmetry by an irreducible one acting on
new variables is not new. in fact, it originates in the hamiltonian formal-
ism, where a reducible set of rst-class constraints can be replaced with an
irreducible one via introducing some new variables [30]-[31].

the paper is structured in ve sections.

in section 2, we give a brief
description of the model under study. sections 3 and 4 are devoted to the
irreducible brst, respectively, brst-anti-brst quantization. section 5
presents some nal conclusions.

2 spin-5/2 gauge elds

we start with the lagrangian action [18], [24]

the pauli metric ( = 1, 2, 3, 4) and hermitian -matrices satisfying

action (1) is invariant under the gauge transformations

stage reducible [2]

with the reducibility functions

z = .

this completes the classical lagrangian analysis.

3 the irreducible brst treatment

in this section we develop an irreducible antield brst approach for the
spin-5/2 gauge elds. initially, we transform the reducible gauge generators
z into some irreducible ones. to this end, we associate a spin-1/2 eld,
, with the reducibility relation (4) and impose its gauge transformation as

 = a,

with a some matrices (that may involve the elds) taken to full

det (az) 6= 0.

from (5) and (7) one can easily see that a possible choice reads as

because az = / has the inverse //. in this way, (6) become

a = 1,

 = .

next, we investigate the theory described by the action

sl
0 [ , ] = sl

0 [] ,

(10)

subject to the gauge transformations (3) and (9). a noteworthy feature
of this theory is that its gauge transformations are irreducible on account
of (7). it is remarkable that the physical observables corresponding to the
irreducible, respectively, reducible models coincide. this can be seen as
follows. let f (, ) be an observable of the irreducible theory. then, its
gauge variation should vanish (at least when the equations of motion hold).
this implies

f


z +

a = 0.

f


(11)

(12)

(13)

multiplying (11) by z, and using (4) and (7) we nd

from (11) and (12) we obtain

f


= 0.

f


z = 0.

the last formula shows that if f is an observable for the irreducible theory,
it is observable also for the reducible one. conversely, if f () is an observ-
able for the reducible model (i.e. f veries (13)), then it remains so in the
irreducible case because it automatically checks (11). in conclusion, the ze-
roth order cohomological groups associated with the irreducible, respectively,
reducible brst operator are equal. moreover, the numbers of physical de-
grees of freedom corresponding to both cases are equal, therefore the path
integrals associated with the irreducible and reducible systems describe the
same theory.

it is well-known that the brst construction relies on homological per-
turbation theory that requires the acyclicity of the koszul-tate operator,
. for a given gauge theory,  can be recursively derived antighost level by
antighost level.
in our irreducible approach, the minimal ghost spectrum
contains the bosonic ghosts  with ghost number one, while the minimal
antield spectrum involves the elds

the antield  being -closed, it follows that there can be nontrivial co-
cycles in the homology of  at non-vanishing resolution degrees. in order to
show that  is however acyclic, we prove that  is -exact. multiplying (19)
from the left by , we nd after simple computation

hence  is -exact.

the last step of this treatment resides in deriving the path integral of
the irreducible theory. with the above spectra at hand, the non-minimal
solution of the master equation reads as

and (b, b

we pass to the gauge-xing procedure. for subsequent purpose, we will
implement three gauge-xing fermions. the rst fermion is taken of the form

using the concrete form of (24), we can emphasize clearer the advantages
of our irreducible procedure. the last term from (24) is invariant (as in the
reducible case) under the gauge transformations

c   c + c,    + ,

(25)

with c and  arbitrary spinors. these invariances are however cancelled by
the term c, which simultaneously xes c and . in the reducible
approach, there is necessary to supplement the ghost spectrum with ghosts
of ghosts (and consequently enlarge the non-minimal sector) in order to x
the above invariances, in contrast with the present case. in order to make
the link with the reducible approach exposed in [2], we choose an alternative
gauge-xing fermion under the form

k  = az d4xc /,

(26)

with a a non-vanishing constant. in this case the corresponding gauge-xed
action is given by

sk  = sl

the last two terms in (28) are identical with the corresponding ones from [2],
while the term c/ replaces the remaining terms appearing in sgauge
and sghost derived within this reference. the nielsen-kallosh ghost for
spin-5/2 gauge elds present in [2] is absent in our procedure, but the role of
the extraghost c 
1 is played here by . the third gauge-xing fermion to be
discussed below allows us to make a proper correlation with the gauge-xed
action to be derived in the framework of the brst-anti-brst formalism
(see the next section). it has the expression

k  = z d4xc ,

with

the resulting gauge-xed action is

the gauge conditions implemented via (30) have been not used so far in the
literature. nevertheless, (30) stand for some good canonical gauge conditions
because they lead to the terms

(32)

in the gauge-xed action after eliminating the auxiliary elds b (on their eld
equations). all the terms in (32) are linear in the derivatives, as requested by
eld theories with fermions in order to prevent the existence of negative-norm
states.

dure

here we develop the antield brst-anti-brst quantization of action (10),
subject to the irreducible gauge transformations (3) and (9). in connection

with the general approach of the antield brst-anti-brst treatment, we
follow the line from [6], [10]. however, the ideas from [6], [10] are not enough
in the context of our irreducible procedure. they have to be supplemented
with the analysis from the beginning of section 3. the eld, respectively,
ghost spectra read as

sion with the operation of spinor conjugation. in the sequel we will omit the
superscript for simplicity. with the help of the above spectra, we derive the
solution of the master equation in the brst-anti-brst formalism under the
form

this is the nal result of our irreducible antield brst-anti-brst formal-
ism. the gauge-xed action (43) is identical with (31), modulo the identi-
cations

5 conclusion

we showed that free massless spin-5/2 gauge elds can be consistently quan-
tized as an irreducible theory within both the antield brst and brst-anti-
brst approaches. in this context, although the starting model is reducible,
the ghosts of ghosts are not necessary. this is because we replace the initial
reducible generating set with an irreducible one, such that the physical ob-
servables remain the same in both formulations. the irreducibility is gained
by introducing a spin-1/2 gauge eld having trivial eld equation. the triv-
iality of the spin-1/2 gauge eld equation implies the -closedness of the
associated antield. in spite of this, the irreducible koszul-tate operator is
proved to be truly acyclic at non-vanishing antighost numbers. in the frame-
work of the brst procedure we discuss three possibilities of xing the gauge.
the rst one emphasizes in a clearer fashion the meaning of our irreducible
treatment. the second choice is helpful at establishing a comparison with the
reducible methods employed in the literature with regard to the investigated
model. the third election is taken in order to make manifest the equivalence
with the brst-anti-brst gauge-xed action.
