this thesis presents a thorough analysis of the links between the n = 4 supersymmetric
gauge theory in four dimensions and its three topological twisted counterparts. special
emphasis is put in deriving explicit results in terms of the vacuum structure and low-
energy eective description of four-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories. a key
ingredient is the realization of the montonten-olive duality in the twisted theories, which
is discussed in detail from dierent viewpoints.

introduction

topological quantum eld theory [104] has become a very fruitful link between physics
and mathematics. in four dimensions, it provides an extremely powerful framework to
apply and test dierent ideas emerged in the context of duality as a symmetry of extended
supersymmetric gauge theories. two salient examples are the introduction of the seiberg-
witten invariants [72][110], and the strong coupling test of s-duality carried out by vafa
and witten [100] from the analysis of a twisted version of the n = 4 supersymmetric gauge
theory. subsequent generalizations in the framework of the seiberg-witten invariants have
enriched the physics [48][60][70][74][76][78][79][84] as well as the mathematical literature
[85][89][97].

the origin of these connections can be traced back to the work of donaldson in the
early eighties. donaldson addressed the problem of classifying dierentiable structures on
four-manifolds by studying classical non-abelian gauge theory. he introduced the cele-
brated donaldson invariants, which are invariants of the dieomorphism type of smooth
four-manifolds, and which are dened as cohomology classes on instanton moduli spaces
[28][29].

in 1988, edward witten made a decisive contribution to the eld with his work on
donaldson theory from the point of view of quantum eld theory [104]. he showed
that in a twisted version of the n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory, now known as the
donaldson-witten theory, one can dene certain correlation functions which are equivalent
to the donaldson invariants. his formulation was later reinterpreted by atiyah and jerey
[6] in a more geometrical setting, as the mathai-quillen representative [81] of the thom
class of a vector bundle associated to the moduli space of instantons.

the realization of the donaldson invariants as correlation functions of a physical theory
inmediately raises the question as to whether one can use physical methods to calculate
them, and conversely, whether topological computations can be used to test assumed facts
about the behaviour of physical models. this has been repeatedly shown to be the case
in a series of works [79][84][100][109][110].

this thesis is intended to present a thorough analysis of the links between four di-
mensional n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory and its topologically twisted coun-
terparts. these theories appear as eective worldvolume theories on d3-branes and m5-
branes wrapping supersymmetric cycles of higher dimensional exotic compactication
manifolds [9][82], and provide a promising arena for testing key ideas as eld-theory du-
alities, large n dynamics of supersymmetric gauge theories and, eventually, the recent

ads-cft conjecture [71].

introduction

for the n = 4 theory, the topological twist can be performed in three dierent ways
[114], so one ends up with three dierent topological quantum eld theories which, while
living in arbitrary four-dimensional geometries, should nevertheless retain some informa-
tion about their physical origin. the way to unravel and at the same time take advantage
of this connection between sym theories and their twisted counterparts is as follows.
the twisted theories are topological in the sense that the partition function as well as a
selected set of correlation functions are independent of the metric which denes the back-
ground geometry. in the short distance regime, computations in the twisted theory are
given exactly by a saddle-point calculation around a certain bosonic background or moduli
space, and in fact the correlation funcions can be reinterpreted as describing intersection
theory on this moduli space. this correspondence can be made more precise through the
mathai-quillen construction [6][81], and this topic was addressed in full generality for the
n = 4 theories in [56]. unfortunately, it is not possible to perform explicit computations
from this viewpoint: the moduli spaces one ends up with are generically non-compact,
and no precise recipe is known to properly compactify them.

a complementary approach which sheds more light on the structure of the twisted
theories and allows explicit computations involves the long-distance regime, where one
expects that a good description should be provided by the degrees of freedom of the
vacuum states of the physical theory on ir4. if the physical theory admits an eective low-
energy seiberg-witten description [92][93], it might appear that the answer for the twisted,
topological theory should come by integration over the corresponding moduli space of
vacua (the u-plane) of the physical model. this conjecture is indeed true, and has been
recently put on a sound basis by moore and witten [84], who have given the precise recipe
for integrating over the u-plane. in the case of the pure n = 2 theory with gauge group
su(2), they have been able to reproduce well-known results of the donaldson theory. this
approach is at the heart of the successful reformulation of the donaldson theory in terms
of the seiberg-witten invariants proposed by witten in [110]. the question immediately
arises as to whether it is possible to carry out a similar computation for the twisted n = 4
theories.

while for the topological theories related to asymptotically free n = 2 theories the
interest lies in their ability to dene topological invariants for four-manifolds, for the
twisted n = 4 theories the topological character is used as a tool to perform explicit
computations which may shed light on the structure of the physical n = 4 theory. this
theory is nite and conformally invariant [90], and is conjectured to have a symmetry
exchanging strong and weak coupling and exchanging electric and magnetic elds [83],
which extends to a full sl(2, zz) symmetry acting on the microscopic complexied cou-
pling 0. it is natural to expect that this property should be shared by the twisted theories
on arbitrary four-manifolds. this was checked by vafa and witten for one of the twisted
theories and for gauge group su(2) [100], and it was clearly mostly interesting to extend
their computation to higher rank groups and to the other twisted theories. in this con-
text, the u-plane approach has been applied to the twisted mass-deformed n = 4 sym

duality in topological quantum field theories

theory with gauge group su(2) [59]. this theory is obtained by twisting the n = 4 sym
theory with bare masses for two of the chiral multiplets. the physical theory preserves
n = 2 supersymmetry, and its low-energy eective description was given by seiberg and
witten [93]. the answer for the twisted theory, which is a topological eld theory with
an arbitrary mass parameter, is given explicitly and completely in terms of the periods
and the discriminant of the seiberg-witten solution of the physical model. the parti-
tion function of the twisted theory transforms as a modular form and, as in the theory
considered by vafa and witten, it is possible to sharpen the computations by including
non-abelian electric and magnetic t hooft uxes [44] which are exchanged under duality
in the expected fashion. it is also possible to compute correlation functions for a selected
set of operators, and these turn out to transform covariantly under sl(2, zz), following a
pattern which can be reproduced with a far more simple topological abelian model. all
these resuts will be reviewed in chapter 6.

it would be very interesting, in the light of the ads/cft correspondence, to generalize
these results to su(n) gauge groups, but the generalization involves many non-trivial
constructions which are only available for the pure n = 2 sym theory [76]. on the other
hand, the vafa-witten twist seems to be a far more promising example.
in this case,
however, the approach based on the seiberg-witten eective description is not useful,
but, as conjectured by vafa and witten, one can nevertheless compute in terms of the
vacuum degrees of freedom of the n = 1 theory which results from giving bare masses
to all the three chiral multiplets of the n = 4 theory. as analyzed in detail in [58],
the twisted massive theory is topological on kahler four-manifolds with h2,0 6= 0, and the
partition function is invariant under the perturbation. under certain general assumptions,
the construction of vafa and witten can be generalized to su(n) (at least when n is
prime), and the resulting formula turns out to satisfy all the required constraints [61].
it is still not clear what the large n limit of this formula corresponds to on the gravity
side, but the issue certainly deserves further study. these facts will be reviewed in great
length in chapter 5.

as for the third twisted n = 4 theory, no explicit results have been obtained so
far, but some general features are known which constrain the structure of its topological
observables. the theory is believed to be a certain deformation of the four-dimensional
bf theory, and as such it describes essentially intersection theory on the moduli space
of complexied at connections [14][73].
it has also been pointed out that the theory
is amphicheiral, which means that it is invariant to a reversal of the orientation of the
spacetime manifold. the terminology is borrowed from knot theory, where an oriented
knot is said to be amphicheiral if, crudely speaking, it is equivalent to its mirror image
[69]. from this property it can be shown [56] that the topological invariants of the theory
are completely independent of the complexied coupling 0. all this will be reviewed in
chapter 7.

the organization of the thesis is as follows.

in chapter 1 we present a general in-
troduction to topological quantum eld theories from a functional integral perspective.
in chapter 2 we briey review the mathai-quillen formalism, with special emphasis on

12

introduction

those aspects which are relevant to the work presented here. several excellent reviews are
available [10][13][20], to which we refer the reader for details. in chapter 3 we review the
structure of the n = 4 theory and study its low-energy eective description for gauge
group su(2). we also comment on several aspects of electric-magnetic duality on arbi-
trary four-manifolds. in chapter 4 we review the twisting of the n = 4 theory and make
several remarks about the structure of the twisted theories. we also discuss the connec-
tion between topological quantum eld theories and string theory. chapters 5, 6 and 7
deal with each of the twisted n = 4 theories, both from the viewpoint of the twist and
the mathai-quillen approach. they also include a thorough description of exact results
for these theories where available. many technical details are deferred to apendices at the
end of each chapter. finally, an appendix contains the conventions used throughout this
work.

chapter 1

topological quantum eld theory

in this chapter we will study the general structure of topological quantum eld theory
(tqft) from a functional integral point of view. the involved functional integration
is not in general well dened but, as in ordinary quantum eld theory, an axiomatic
approach has been constructed [7], which we shall not attempt to review here. we will
concentrate instead on a naive functional integral approach. although not well dened in
general, it is the approach which has shown to be more successful.

the basic framework will consist of an n-dimensional riemannian manifold x endowed
with a metric g. on this manifold we will consider a set of elds {i}, and a real
functional of these elds s(i), which will be regarded as the action of the theory. we
will consider operators o(i), which will in general be arbitrary functionals of the elds.
in tqft these functionals are labelled by some set of indices  carrying topological
or group-theoretical data. the vacuum expectation value (vev) of a product of these
operators is dened as the following functional integral:

ho1o2   opi =z [di]o1(i)o2(i)  op(i) exp(cid:0)  s(i)(cid:1).

a quantum eld theory is considered topological if it possesses the following property:

(1.1)


g ho1o2   opi = 0,

(1.2)

i.e.
if the vacuum expectation values (vevs) of some set of selected operators remain
invariant under variations of the metric g on x. if such is the case, these operators are
called observables.

there are two ways to guarantee, at least formally, that condition (1.2) is satised.
the rst one corresponds to the situation in which both the action s and the operators
o, are metric-independent. these tqfts are called of the schwarz type [10]. in the
case of schwarz-type theories one must rst construct an action which is independent of
the metric g. the method is best illustrated by considering an explicit example. let us
take into consideration the most interesting case of this type of theories: chern-simons
gauge theory [105]. the data in the chern-simons gauge theory are the following: a

13

14

dierentiable compact three-manifold x, a gauge group g, which will be taken simple
and compact, and an integer parameter k. the action is the integral of the chern-simons
form associated to a gauge connection a corresponding to the group g:

scs(a) =zx

tr(cid:18)a  da +

2
3

a  a  a(cid:19) .

(1.3)

observables are constructed out of operators which do not contain the metric g. in
gauge-invariant theories, as is the case here, one must also demand that these operators be
invariant under gauge transformations. the basic set of observables in the chern-simons
gauge theory is provided by the trace of the holonomy of the gauge connection a in some
representation r along a 1-cycle  in x, that is, the wilson loop:

a.

(1.4)

trr(cid:0)hol(a)(cid:1) = trrp expz
ai =z [da]trr1per1

the vevs are labelled by representations ri and embeddings i of s1 into x:

htrr1per1

a . . . trrnpern

a . . . trrnpern

ae

ik

4 scs(a).

(1.5)

a non-perturbative analysis of the theory [105] shows that the invariants associated to
the observables (1.5) are knot and link invariants as the jones polynomial [51] and its
generalizations. the perturbative analysis has conrmed this result and has shown to
provide a very useful framework to study the vassiliev invariants (see [55][67] for a brief
review.)

another important set of tqft of the schwarz type are the bf theories [45]. these
can be formulated in any dimension and are believed to be, as the chern-simons gauge the-
ory, exactly solvable quantum eld theories. we will not describe them in this work. they
have recently acquired importance since it has been pointed out that four-dimensional
yang-mills theories could be regarded as a deformation of these theories [19].

the second way to guarantee (1.2) corresponds to the case in which there exists a

symmetry, whose innitesimal form will be denoted by , with the following properties:

where t(i) is the energy-momentum tensor of the theory, i.e.

o(i) = 0,

t(i) = g(i),

and g(i) is some functional of the elds i.

t(i) =


g s(i),

(1.6)

(1.7)

the fact that  in (1.6) is a symmetry of the theory means that the transformations
i of the elds are such that both s(i) = 0 and o(i) = 0. conditions (1.6) lead,
at least formally, to the following relation for vevs:



g ho1o2   opi = z [di]o1(i)o2(i)  op(i)t exp(cid:0)  s(i)(cid:1)

= z [di](cid:16)o1(i)o2(i)  op(i)g exp(cid:0)  s(i)(cid:1)(cid:17) = 0,

(1.8)

duality in topological quantum field theories

15

which implies that the quantum eld theory can be regarded as topological. in (1.8) it has
been assumed that the action and the measure [di] are invariant under the symmetry
. we have also assumed in (1.8) that the observables are metric-independent. this is a
common situation in this type of theories, but it does not have to be so. in fact, in view
of (1.8), it would be possible to consider a wider class of operators satisfying:


g o(i) = o

 (i),

(1.9)

with o

 (i) a certain functional of the elds of the theory.

this second class of tqfts is called cohomological or of the witten type [10][107].
its most celebrated representatives are the four-dimensional donaldson-witten theory
[104], which can be regarded as a certain twisted version of the n = 2 supersymmetric
yang-mills theory, and the two-dimensional topological sigma models [106], which are
also twisted versions of the conventional n = 2 sigma model.
in fact, all the twisted
supersymmetric quantum eld theories are topological eld theories of this type.

it is important to remark that the symmetry  must be a scalar symmetry. the reason
is that, being a global symmetry, the corresponding generator must be covariantly constant
and for arbitrary manifolds this property, if satised at all, implies strong restrictions
unless the generator is a singlet under the holonomy of the manifold.

most of the tqfts of cohomological type satisfy the relation:

s(i) = (i),

(1.10)

for some functional (i). this has far-reaching consequences, for it means that the
topological observables of the theory (in particular the partition function itself) are in-
dependent of the value of the coupling constant. indeed, let us consider for example the
vev:

ho1o2   opi =z [di]o1(i)o2(i)  op(i) exp(cid:18)

1

e2 s(i)(cid:19) .

(1.11)

under a change in the coupling constant, 1/e2  1/e2  , one has (assuming that the
observables do not depend on the coupling), up to rst order in :

ho1o2   opi  ho1o2   opi

+z [di](cid:20)o1(i)o2(i)  op(i)(i) exp(cid:18)

= ho1o2   opi.

1

e2 s(i)(cid:19)(cid:21)

(1.12)

hence, observables can be computed either in the weak coupling limit, e  0, or in the
strong coupling limit, e  .
so far we have presented a rather general denition of tqft and made a series of
elementary remarks. now we will analyse some aspects of its structure. we begin by

16

topological quantum eld theory

pointing out that given a theory in which (1.6) holds, one can build correlators which cor-
respond to topological invariants (in the sense that they are invariant under deformations
of the metric g) just by considering the operators of the theory which are invariant un-
der the symmetry. we will call these operators observables. actually, to be more precise,
we will call observables to certain classes of those operators. in virtue of eq. (1.8), if one
of these operators can be written as a symmetry transformation of another operator, its
presence in a correlation function will make it vanish. thus we may identify operators
satisfying (1.6), which dier by an operator which corresponds to a symmetry transforma-
tion of another operator. let us denote the set of the resulting classes by {}. actually,
in general, one could identify bigger sets of operators since two operators of which one
does not satisfy (1.6) could lead to the same invariant if they diered by an operator
which is a symmetry transformation of another operator. for example, consider o such
that o = 0 and o + . certainly, both operators lead to the same observables. but
it may well happen that 2 6= 0 and therefore we have operators, which do not satisfy
(1.6), that must be identied. the natural way out is to work equivariantly, which in this
context means that one must consider only operators which are invariant under both 
and 2. it turns out that in most of the cases (and in particular, in all the cases that we
will be considering) 2 is a gauge transformation, so in the end all that has to be done is
to restrict the analysis to gauge-invariant operators, a very natural requirement. hence,
by restricting the analysis to the appropriate set of operators, one has in fact,

2 = 0.

(1.13)

property (1.13) has striking consequences on the features of tqft. first, the sym-
metry must be odd, which implies the presence in the theory of commuting and anti-
commuting elds. for example, the tensor g in (1.6) must be anticommuting. this is
the rst appearance of an odd non-spinorial eld in tqft. those kinds of objects are
standard features of cohomological tqfts. secondly, if we denote by q the operator
which implements this symmetry, the observables of the theory can be described as the
cohomology classes of q:

{} =

ker q
im q

,

q2 = 0.

(1.14)

equation (1.6) means that in addition to the poincare group the theory possesses a
symmetry generated by an odd version of the poincare group. the corresponding odd
generators are constructed out of the tensor g in much the same way as the ordinary
poincare generators are built out of t. for example, if p represents the ordinary
momentum operator, there exists a corresponding odd one g such that

p = {q, g}.

(1.15)

let us discuss the structure of the hilbert space of the theory in virtue of the sym-
metries that we have just described. the states of this space must correspond to repre-
sentations of the algebra generated by the operators in the poincare groups and by q.

duality in topological quantum field theories

17

furthermore, as follows from the analysis leading to (1.14), if one is interested only in
states |i leading to topological invariants, one must consider states that satisfy

q|i = 0,

(1.16)

and two states which dier by a q-exact state must be identied. the odd poincare group
can be used to generate descendant states out of a state satisfying (1.16). the operators
g act non-trivially on the states and in fact, out of a state satisfying (1.16), we can build
additional states using this generator. the simplest case consists of

z1

g|i,

(1.17)

where 1 is a 1-cycle. one can easily verify using (1.6) that this new state satises (1.16):

qz1

g|i =z1{q, g}|i =z1

p|i = 0.

(1.18)

similarly, one may construct other invariants tensoring n operators g and integrating
over n-cycles n:

zn

g1g2...gn|i.

(1.19)

notice that since the operator g is odd and its algebra is poincare-like the integrand
in this expression is an n-form.
it is straightforward to prove that these states also
satisfy condition (1.16). therefore, starting from a state |i  ker q we have built a
set of partners or descendants giving rise to a topological multiplet. the members of a
multiplet have well dened ghost number. if one assigns ghost number 1 to the operator
g, the state in (1.19) has ghost number n plus the ghost number of |i. of course,
n is bounded by the dimension of the manifold x. among the states constructed in this
way there may be many which are related via another state which is q-exact, i.e.which
can be written as q acting on some other state. let us try to single out representatives
at each level of ghost number in a given topological multiplet.

consider an (n  1)-cycle which is the boundary of an n-dimensional surface, n1 =

sn. if one builds a state taking such a cycle one nds (p = i)

g1g2...gn|i, (1.20)

zn1

g1g2...gn1|i = izsn

p[1g2g3...gn]|i = iqzsn

i.e.it is q-exact. the symbols [ ] in (1.20) denote that all indices between them must
by antisymmetrized. in (1.20) use has been made of (1.15). this result tells us that the
representatives we are looking for are built out of the homology cycles of the manifold
x. given a manifold x, the homology cycles are equivalence classes among cycles, the
equivalence relation being that two n-cycles are equivalent if they dier by a cycle which
is the boundary of an n + 1 surface. thus, knowledge of the homology of the manifold on

18

topological quantum eld theory

which the tqft is dened allows us to classify the representatives among the operators
(1.19). let us assume that x has dimension d and that its homology cycles are in,
in = 1, ..., dn, n = 0, ..., d, dn being the dimension of the n-homology group, and d the
dimension of x. then, the non-trivial partners or descendants of a given |i highest-
ghost-number state are labelled in the following way:

zin

g1g2...gn|i,

in = 1, ..., dn,

n = 0, ..., d.

(1.21)

a construction similar to the one just described can be made for elds. starting with

a eld (x) which satises

[q, (x)] = 0,

(1.22)

one can construct other elds using the operators g. these elds, which we will call
partners or descendants, are antisymmetric tensors dened as

(n)
12...n(x) =

1
n!

[g1, [g2...[gn, (x)}...}},

n = 1, ..., d.

(1.23)

using (1.15) and (1.22) one nds that these elds satisfy the so-called topological descent
equations:

d(n) = i[q, (n+1)},

(1.24)

where the subindices of the forms have been suppressed for simplicity, and the highest-
ghost-number eld (x) has been denoted as (0)(x). these equations enclose all the
relevant properties of the observables which are constructed out of them. they constitute
a very useful tool to build the observables of the theory. let us consider an n-cycle and
the following quantity:

w (n)

 =zn

(n).

(1.25)

the subindex of this quantity denotes the highest-ghost-number eld out of which the
form (n) is generated. the superindex denotes the order of such a form as well as the
cycle which is utilized in the integration. using the topological descent equations (1.24)
it is immediate to prove that w (n)

is indeed an observable:



[q, w (n)



} =zn

[q, (n)} = izn

d(n1) = 0.

(1.26)

furthermore, if n is a trivial homology cycle, n = sn+1, one obtains that w (n)
q-exact:



is

w (n)

 =zn

(n) =zsn+1

d(n) = izsn+1

[q, (n+1)} = i(cid:20)q,zsn+1

(n+1)(cid:27) ,

(1.27)

duality in topological quantum field theories

19

and therefore its presence in a vev makes it vanish. thus, similarly to the previous analysis
leading to (1.21), the observables of the theory are operators of the form (1.25):

w (in )



,

in = 1, ..., dn,

n = 0, ..., d,

(1.28)

where, as before, dn denotes the dimension of the n-homology group. of course, these
observables are a basis of observables, but one can make arbitrary products of them,
leading to new ones.

one may wonder at this point how it is possible that there may be observables which
depend on the space-time position x and nevertheless lead to topological invariants. for
example, an observable containing the zero form (0)(x) seems to lead to vevs which
depend on x, since the space-time position x is not integrated over. a closer analysis,
however, shows that this is not the case. as follows from the topological descent equa-
tion (1.24), the derivative of (0)(x) with respect to x is q-exact and therefore such a
vev is actually independent of the space-time position. this is completely analogous to
the situation in conventional supersymmetric gauge theories, where it is well-known [2]
that certain correlation functions (as the gaugino condensate) are independent of spatial
separation and can be computed in either the short or long distance limits.

20

topological quantum eld theory

chapter 2

the mathai-quillen formalism

tqfts of the cohomological type are conventionally characterized by three basic data:
elds, symmetries, and equations [10][20][107]. the starting point is a conguration space
m, whose elements are elds i dened on some riemannian manifold x. these elds
are generally acted on by some group g of local transformations (gauge symmetries,
or a dieomorphism group, among others), so that one is naturally led to consider the
quotient space m/g. within this quotient space, a certain subset of special congurations
or moduli space, m0, is singled out by a set of equations s(i) = 0:

m0 = {i  m|s(i) = 0}/g.

(2.1)

this moduli space is generically nite-dimensional. the crucial aspect of topological eld
theories is that the path integral localizes to these congurations

z =zm

di es(i) zm0    ,

(2.2)

and this makes it possible to express partition and correlation functions as nite dimen-
sional integrals over the moduli space.

in standard supersymmetric theories, these type of special congurations typically
arise as supersymmetric or bps congurations, which are characterized by the property
that they preserve a certain fraction of the supersymmetries [87]. for example, in n = 2
supersymmetric gauge theories, the supersymmetry variation of the gaugino reads

 = f,

(2.3)

so that for  satisfying  = 5 we nd that instanton congurations with f + = 0 are
invariant under half of the supersymmetries.
in cohomological eld theories a similar
mechanism works: the moduli space is dened as the xed point set of the topological
symmetry  [108]. within this framework,  furnishes a representation of the g-equivariant
cohomology on the eld space. when g is the trivial group,  is nothing but the de rham
(or exterior dierential) operator on the eld space.

21

22

the mathai-quillen formalism

it can be applied to any witten-type theory.

the next step consists of building the topological theory associated to this moduli
problem. we will do this within the framework of the mathai-quillen formalism [81].
this formalism is the most geometric of all the approaches leading to the construction
of tqfts.
it was rst implemented in
the context of tqft by atiyah and jerey [6], and later further developed in two works
[11][20]. the basic idea behind this formalism is the extension, to the innite-dimensional
case, of ordinary nite-dimensional geometric constructions. soon after the formulation of
the rst tqfts it became clear that the partition function of these theories was related
to the euler class of a certain bundle associated to the space of solutions of the basic
equations of the theory. in the nite-dimensional case there are many dierent, though
equivalent, forms of thinking on the euler class, which we will recall bellow. the mathai-
quillen formalism basically consists of generalizing one of these forms to the innite-
dimensional case. in what follows we will give a brief account of the fundamentals of the
construction. for further details, we refer the reader to [13][20][57], where comprehensive
reviews on this approach are presented.

2.1 finite-dimensional case

let x be an orientable, boundaryless, compact n-dimensional manifold. let us consider
an orientable vector bundle e  x of rank rk(e) = 2m  n over x. for completeness we
recall that a vector bundle e, with a 2m-dimensional vector space f as bre, over a base
manifold x, is a topological space with a continuous projection,  : e  x, such that
x  x,  ux  x, open set, x  ux, e is a product space, ux  f , when restricted to ux.
this means that there exists a homeomorphism  : ux  f  1(u) which preserves
the bres, i.e.((x, f )) = x, with f  f .
there exist two complementary ways of dening the euler class of e, e(e)  h 2m(x):
1. in terms of sections. a section s of e is a map s : x  e such that (s(x)) = x.
a generic section is one which is transverse to the zero section, and which therefore
vanishes on a set of dimension n2m. in this context e(e) shows up as the poincare
dual (in x) of the homology class dened by the zero locus of a generic section of
e.

2. in terms of characteristic classes. the approach makes use of the chern-weil theory,

and gives a representative e(e) of e(e) associated to a connection  in e:

e(e) = (2)mpf(),

(2.4)

where pf() stands for the pfaan of the curvature , which is an antisymmetric
matrix of two-forms. the representative e(e) can be written in eld-theoretical
form:

e(e) = (2)mz de

2 aab

 b,

(2.5)

duality in topological quantum field theories

23

by means of a set of real grassmann-odd variables a, a = 1, . . . , 2m, satisfying the
berezin rules of integration:

z dab = ab.

(2.6)

if rk(e) = 2m = n = dim(x), one can evaluate e(e) on x to obtain the euler number

of e in two dierent ways:

(1),

(e) = xxk:s(xk)=0
(e) = zx

e(e).

(2.7)

in the rst case, one counts signs at the zeroes of a generic section (notice that in this case
a generic section has a zero locus s(x) = 0 consisting of a nite set of isolated points.) in
the second case, one integrates the dierential form (2.4) over x. of course, both results
coincide, and do not depend either on the section s (as long as it is generic) or on the
connection . when 2m < n one can evaluate e(e) on 2m-cycles or equivalently take the
product with elements of h n2m(x) and evaluate it on x.

in the particular case that e  t x the expression (e) =pxk:s(xk)=0(1), which gives

the euler number of the base manifold x, can be generalized to a non-generic vector eld
v (which is a section of the tangent bundle)

(x) = (xv ),

(2.8)

where xv is the zero locus of v , which is not necessarily zero-dimensional.

in this framework the mathai-quillen formalism gives a representative of the euler
class es,(e), which interpolates between the two approaches described above. it depends
explicitly on both a section s and a connection  on e:

es,(e)  [e(e)],

(e) = zx

es,(e),

(if 2m = n).

(2.9)

the construction of es, is given by the formalism. first, it provides an explicit repre-
sentative of the thom class [16], (e), of e. let e  x be a vector bundle of rank 2m
with bre f , and let us consider the cohomology of forms with gaussian decay along the
bre. by integrating the form along the bre, one has an explicit isomorphism (the thom
isomorphism) between k forms over e and k  2m forms over x. this isomorphism can
be made explicit with the aid of the thom class, whose representative (e) is a closed
2m-form over e with gaussian decay along the bre such that its integral over the bre is

24

the mathai-quillen formalism

unity. in terms of this form, and given any arbitrary p-form  over x, its image under the
thom isomorphism is the p + 2m form () (e), which by construction has gaussian
decay along the bre. () is the pull-back of  by the projection  : e  x. if s is
any section of e, the pull-back of the thom form under s, s(e), is a closed form in
the same cohomology class as the euler class e(e). if s is a generic section, then s(e)
is the poincare dual of the zero locus of s. mathai and quillen constructed an explicit
representative, (e), of the thom form in terms of a connection  in e. its pull-back
by a section s, es,(e) = s(e), is represented as a grassmann integral:

2|s|2+ 1

2 aab

 b+isaa.

(2.10)

es,(e) = (2)mz de 1

as a consistency check, note that, as follows from (2.5), es=0,(e) = e(e), i.e.
the
pull-back of the mathai-quillen representative by the zero section gives back the euler
class of e. es,(e) is a closed 2m-form. this can be veried after integrating over the
grassmann-odd variables a.
it is closed because the exponent is invariant under the
transformations

(2.11)
these transformations square on-shell (that is, using the  equation of motion isa =
ab


b) to rotations by the curvature matrix ,

a = isa(x).

s = s,

2sa = ab


sb,

2a = ab


b.

(2.12)

the mathai-quillen representative (2.10) interpolates between the two dierent ap-
proaches to the euler class of a vector bundle described above. this statement can be
made more precise as follows. the construction of es,(e) is such that it is cohomologous
to e(e) for any choice of a generic section s. take for example the case n = 2m, and
rescale s  s. nothing should change, so in particular:

(e) =zx

es,(e).

(2.13)

we can now study (2.13) in two dierent limits:

2. limit   : the curvature term in (2.10) can be neglected, and the integration
in (2.10) localizes to a nite sum over the moduli space s(x) = 0, leading to

1. limit   0: after using (2.5), (e) = (2)mr pf().
(e) =pxk:s(xk)=0(1). these signs are generated by the ratio of the determinants

of s and its modulus, which result from the gaussian integrations after expanding
around each zero xk.

this localization property can be restated in terms of the grassman odd scalar sym-
metry . notice that the xed point of the symmetry transformations (2.11) is the set
sa(x) = 0 = s, which is precisely the moduli space to which the integration (2.13)
localizes. this is a simple realization of the general result due to witten [108] that we
mentioned above.

duality in topological quantum field theories

2.2 innite-dimensional case

we now turn into the study of the innite-dimensional case. the main complication
that one nds in this case is that e(e) is not dened. by taking advantage of what we
have learned so far, we could try to generalize the mathai-quillen formalism to dene
something analogous to an euler class for e. it turns out that this is actually possible,
and the outcome of the construction is what is called a regularized euler number for the
bundle e. unfortunately, it depends explicitly on the section chosen for the construction,
so it is important to make good selections.
the outline of the construction is as follows. first recall that, as stated in (2.8), in
the nite-dimensional case (x) = (xv ) when v is non-generic, i.e.when its zero locus,
xv , has dimension dim(xv ) < 2m. for x innite-dimensional the idea is to introduce
a vector eld v with nite-dimensional zero locus. the regularized euler number of e
would then be dened as:

v (x) = (xv ),

(2.14)

which explicitly depends on v . by analogy with the nite-dimensional case one expects
that:

v (x) =zx

ev,(t x),

(2.15)

as a functional integral, where ev,(t x) is meant to be the mathai-quillen representative
for the corresponding euler class.

in general, the regularized euler number s(e) of an innite-dimensional vector bundle

e is given by:

s(e) =zx

es,(e),

(2.16)

where es,(e) is given by the mathai-quillen formalism. the construction follows the
pattern of the nite-dimensional case. but it is important to remark that (2.16) makes
sense only when the zero locus of s, xs, is nite-dimensional. s(e) is then the euler
number of some nite-dimensional vector bundle over xs, and it corresponds to the reg-
ularized euler number of the innite-dimensional bundle e. of course, s(e) depends
on s, but if s is naturally associated to e one expects to obtain interesting topological
information. for topological quantum eld theories, s is given by the xed points of the
fermionic symmetry , which in turn comes from the underlying supersymmetry of the
theory. the expression in the exponential in (2.10) is the action of the topological model,
and the rst term,  1
2|s|2, gives the purely bosonic terms in the action, while saa gives
the kinetic energy of the fermions (notice that s is a one-form on x, so one can see it
as a fermion). the situation where there are local symmetries in the problem (such as
conventional gauge symmetries) is more involved, but one can easily extend the formalism
to cover these cases as explained in great detail in [20]. we will review the construction
when we describe the twisted n = 4 theories below.

the n = 4 supersymmetric gauge
theory in four dimensions

in this chapter we will review some aspects of the four-dimensional n = 4 supersymmetric
gauge theory. we will describe the seiberg-witten solution for the low-energy eective
description of the n = 4 theory with gauge group su(2), and we will make several
remarks concerning the montonen-olive strong/weak-coupling duality symmetry of the
theory on arbitrary four-manifolds.

3.1 n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory
we begin with the standard n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory on at ir4. our
conventions regarding spinor notation are almost as in wess and bagger [103], with some
dierences that we conveniently compile in the nal appendix.

the n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory is unique once the gauge group g and
the microscopic coupling 0 = 0
are xed. the lagrangian and supersymmetry
transformations can be constructed from the n = 1 supersymmetric yang-mills theory in
10 dimensions by dimensional reduction on a six-torus [17]. the ten-dimensional lorentz
group so(1, 9) splits as so(1, 3)so(6)i, where so(1, 3) is the four-dimensional lorentz
group, while so(6)i  su(4)i, which corresponds to the rotation group in the extra di-
mensions, appears in the four-dimensional theory as a global symmetry group (it is in fact
the automorphism or r symmetry group of the n = 4 supersymmetry algebra). the eld
 and their
content of the model is the following: a gauge eld a , four weyl gauginos u
complex conjugates u
 (which come from the 10-dimensional majorana-weyl gaugino)
transforming respectively in the representations 4 and 4 of su(4)i (u, v, w, . . . = 1, 2, 3, 4
are su(4)i indices), and six scalars uv (which come from the 10-dimensional gauge eld)
in the 6 of su(4)i. all the elds above take values in the adjoint representation of some
compact lie group g. being in the representation 6, the scalars uv satisfy antisymmetry

correspondingly, the transformations (3.3) close the supersymmetry algebra on-shell.

in ir4, the global symmetry group of n = 4 supersymmetric theories is h = su(2)l
su(2)r  su(4)i, where k = su(2)l  su(2)r is the rotation group so(4). the

supersymmetry generators responsible for the transformations (3.3) are qu
they transform as (2, 1, 4)  (1, 2, 4) under h.
from the point of view of n = 1 superspace, the theory contains one n = 1 vector
multiplet and three n = 1 chiral multiplets. these supermultiplets are represented in
n = 1 superspace by superelds v and s (s = 1, 2, 3), which satisfy the constraints
v = v  and d s = 0, being d  a superspace covariant derivative. the physical
component elds of these superelds are:

3.2 electromagnetic duality in the n = 4 theory

within the last ve years, electromagnetic duality has become a powerful tool to unravel
the structure of strongly coupled quantum gauge theories and string theory. in many the-
ories with n = 1 [91] and n = 2 [92][93] supersymmetry, duality shows up as a symmetry
of the eective low-energy description, and it plays a prominent role in disentangling the
infrared dynamics  see [35] for a review. on the other hand, in the n = 4 theory and
some special n = 2 theories, the duality is exact, in the sense that it is conjectured to
hold valid at all energy scales.
the massless n = 4 supersymmetric theory has zero beta function, and it is believed
to be exactly nite and conformally invariant, even non-perturbatively [90]. the full
duality group is actually sl(2, zz), which includes a zz2 corresponding to the interchange
of electric and magnetic charges along with the interchange of strong and weak coupling
as originally proposed some twenty years ago by montonen and olive [83][86].

the purpose of this section is to discuss some aspects of this duality. we will start by
briey reviewing the denition of the magnetic group h v dual to a compact lie group h

30

the n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimensions

[34]. we follow the discussions in [41] and [30]. in a gauge theory with unbroken gauge
group h one can consider two kinds of quantum numbers. electric quantum numbers are
xed by the representations under which the elds transform, and take values in the weight
lattice h
weight of h. magnetic quantum numbers are topological in nature, and are related
to gauge congurations over two-spheres. they are in fact the winding numbers of the
equatorial transition functions f () : s2  h, and the dirac quantization condition, as
generalized by goddard, nuyts and olive [34], forces them to take values in the coweight
lattice h

coweight of h, which is dual to h

weight.

i = 2 ~i

~2 which is dual to h

root is the coroot lattice h

the following step is to realize that the magnetic quantum numbers of h are the
electric quantum numbers of another dual group h v, whose weight lattice is dual to that
of h, and whose root lattice h v
coroot of h spanned by the simple
coroots ~v
root. therefore, the true symmetry group of the theory
is actually h  h v. now, the montonen-olive duality conjecture [83] follows simply as
the statement that the electric and magnetic factors are exchanged under an inversion of
the coupling constant e0  1/e0.
let us consider the example h = su(n) in detail. since su(n) is simply laced,
su(n) and su(n)v have the same lie algebra su(n). also, we can identify the coweight
lattice of su(n) with the root lattice of su(n). thus, su (n )v
coweight = su (n )
root =
weight = su (n )v
su (n )v
, su(n)v has no center (h
root  center(h)),
and therefore su(n)v = su(n)/zzn .

weight = su (n )

weight/h

. but since su (n )v

now we can wonder as to how we expect to see montonen-olive duality in the n = 4
theory. first of all, in presence of a non-zero 0 angle, the original zz2 transformation
e0  1/e0 is extended to a full sl(2, zz) symmetry acting on 0

then, under 0  1/0 we expect g to be exchanged with its dual gv. this sl(2, zz)
duality imposes strong constraints on the spectrum of the theory, and those have led to
a series of successful tests on the bps part of spectrum [30][39][87][94].

in addition to this, in the n = 4 theory all the elds take values in the adjoint
representation of g. hence, as pointed out by t hooft [44], if h 2(x, 1(g)) 6= 0 it is
possible to consider non-trivial g/center(g) gauge congurations with discrete magnetic
t hooft ux through the two-cycles of x.
in fact, g/center(g) bundles on x are
classied by the instanton number and a characteristic class v  h 2(x, 1(g)). for
example, if g = su(2), we have su(2)/zz2 = so(3) and v is the second stiefel-whitney
class w2(e) of the gauge bundle e. this stiefel-whitney class can be represented in
de rham cohomology by a cohomology class (a class of dierential two-forms under the
equivalence relation a2  b2  a2 = b2 + dc1, where a2, b2 are two-forms and c1 is a one-
form) in h 2(x, zz) dened modulo 2, i.e., w2(e) and w2(e) + 2, with   h 2(x, zz),
1 on arbitary four-manifolds x, the symmetry group may be reduced to a subgroup of sl(2, zz) as

shown in [100][101][111].

represent the same t hooft ux, so if w2(e) = 2, for some   h 2(x, zz), then the
gauge conguration is trivial in so(3) (it has no t hooft ux.)
similarly, for g = su(n) one can x uxes in h 2(x, zzn ) (the corresponding stiefel-
whitney class is dened modulo n.) one has therefore a family of partition functions
zv(0), one for each magnetic ux v. the su(n) partition function is obtained by
considering the zero ux partition function (up to a factor whose origin is explained in
[100]), while the su(n)/zzn partition function is obtained by summing over all v, and
both are to be exchanged under 0  1/0. the action of sl(2, zz) on the zv should
be compatible with this exchange, and according to [100][113], the 0  1/0 operation
mixes the zv by a discrete fourier transform

zv(1/0) = nb2/2(cid:16) 0

i(cid:17)w/2(cid:18) 0

i(cid:19) w/2 xuh 2(x,zz)

e2iuv/n zu(0).

(3.9)

the modular weights w and w are linear combinations of the euler characteristic  and
the signature  of x. this pattern has been checked for the physical n = 4 theory on
t 4 in [33].
as for the twisted n = 4 theories to be described below, it would be natural to expect
that they should behave in the same way under duality. in fact, for the twisted theories,
and in generic circumstances, the partition function depends holomorphically on 0, so
one would actually expect that they should obey (3.9) with w = 0. this was checked by
vafa and witten for one of the twisted theories and for gauge group su(2) [100], and their
result has been generalized to g = su(n) (with n prime) in [61]. similar results have
been recently derived for another twisted version of the n =4 theory within the u-plane
approach [59]. we will review these results in great detail in chapters 5 and 6 below.

3.3 the seiberg-witten solution

the massless n = 4 theory has a moduli space of vacua in the coulomb phase consisting
of several equivalent copies which are interchanged by the su(4)i symmetry. each of
these copies corresponds to one of the scalar elds uv developing a non-zero vacuum
expectation value. there is a classical singularity at the origin of the moduli space, which
is very likely to survive even in the quantum regime.

bare masses, mr d4xd2tr(12) + h.c. , to two of the chiral multiplets. this mass-

life gets more interesting if one deforms the n = 4 supersymmetric theory by giving
deformed theory still retains n = 2 supersymmetry: the massive superelds build up
an n = 2 hypermultiplet, while the remaining chiral supereld, together with the vector
supereld, build up an n = 2 vector multiplet. the low-energy eective description of
this theory was worked out, for the su(2) gauge group, by seiberg and witten in [93].
their results were subsequently extended to su(n) by donagi and witten in [27], where
a link to the su(n) hitchin integrable system was established. dhoker and phong have

32

the n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimensions

analyzed the su(n) theory in terms of the elliptic calogero-moser integrable system [21],
and have extended the computations to arbitrary gauge groups [22].

some quantitative discrepancies between the proposed solution and explicit instanton
calculations have been pointed out in [31]. the explicit structure of the eective theory for
gauge group su(2) has been much claried by ferrari [32], who has also given a detailed
account of the bps spectrum.

for gauge group su(2) and for generic values of the mass parameter, the moduli space
of physically inequivalent vacua forms a one complex-dimensional compact manifold (the
u-plane). this manifold parametrizes a family of elliptic curves, which encodes all the
relevant information about the low-energy eective description of the theory. the explicit
solution is given by the curve:

and 2, 3 and 4 are the jacobi theta functions  see the appendix to chapter 6 below for
more details. notice that the curve (3.10) depends explicitly on 0 through the modular
forms ej, so sl(2, zz) duality is actually built in from the start.

the parameter z in (3.10) is a global gauge-invariant coordinate on the moduli space
and it is a modular form of weight 2 under the microscopic duality group. it diers from
the physical order parameter htr 2i by instanton corrections [31], which are not predicted
by the seiberg-witten solution. the precise relation is given by:

these bps states are generically dyons carrying non-zero magnetic charge, and can be
constructed in the semiclassical regime by quantizing the zero modes of the elementary
elds of the theory in the background of the dyon [39]. for the massless n = 4 theory,
these zero modes build up a short n = 4 vector multiplet with spins up to 1 [88], and
this explains why the monopoles (with unit magnetic charge and no electric charge) can
be dual, in the montonen-olive sense, to the elementary vector bosons. a non-zero value
of the mass m lifts half of the zero modes, and the remaining ones build up the n = 2
hypermultiplets which produce the singularities.

circumstances, at strong (eective) coupling, there are two singularities at z2, z3, with

an electrically charged (adjoint) quark becoming massless. for this choice of parameters,
we have the explicit formulas:

twisting the n = 4 supersymmetric
gauge theory

the twist in the context of supersymmetric four-dimensional gauge theories was intro-
duced by witten in [104], where he showed that a twisted version of the n = 2 supersym-
metric gauge theory with gauge group su(2) is a relativistic eld-theory realization of
the donaldson theory of four-manifolds. soon after wittens breakthrough, yamron [114]
generalized the construction to the n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory and described
the structure of two of the possible non-equivalent twists of these theories and pointed
out the existence of a third one.

the purpose of this chapter is to describe the possible twists of the n = 4 super-
symmetric gauge theory.
it is intended to provide a general introduction to the next
three chapters. we assume that the reader is familiar with the analogous (yet simpler)
procedure in n = 2 theories [1][10][104][109].

in four dimensions, the global symmetry group of the extended supersymmetric gauge
theories is of the form h = su(2)l  su(2)r  i, where k = su(2)l  su(2)r is
, q j
the rotation group, and i is the chiral r-symmetry group. the supercharges qi
transform under h as (2, 1, n) and (1, 2, n), where n is generically an n -dimensional
representation of the r-symmetry group  n is the number of independent supersymme-
tries. the aim of the twist is to extract from these supercharges one (or several) global
scalar fermionic symmetries  as described in chapter 1  which always exist regardless of
the space-time topology. now to create a scalar supercharge out of spinor supercharges
one has to modify somehow the action of the rotation group on the supercharges. the
idea is to gauge a subgroup of the r-symmetry group with the spin connection in such
a way that at least a linear combination of the original supercharges be a singlet under
a combined lorentz plus chiral rotation  see [66] for a review. depending on how we
choose this subgroup, we will obtain dierent theories after the twisting1. while in n = 2
1note than on a general four-manifold the holonomy group is su (2)l  su (2)r, so the twist will be
an observable eect, that is, the twisted theory and the physical theory will be inequivalent. however,
on a hyper-kahler manifold the holonomy is simply su (2)r, so if one gauges the chiral current with

35

36

twisting the n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory

supersymmetric gauge theories the r-symmetry group is at most u(2) and thus the twist
is essentially unique, in the n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory the r-symmetry group
is su(4) and there are three dierent possibilities, depending on how we embedd the
rotation group into the r-symmetry group [56][100][114].

the possible choices are found just by analyzing how the 4 of su(4)i splits in terms
of representations of the rotation group k. there are just three possibilities which will
give a topological symmetry for a given choice of the su(2) component of k: (i) 4 
(2, 1)(2, 1), (ii) 4  (2, 1)(1, 1)(1, 1) and (iii) 4  (2, 1)(1, 2), each of which leads
to a dierent topological quantum eld theory. choosing the other su(2) component of
k one would obtain the equivalent twists: 4  (1, 2) (1, 2), 4  (1, 2) (1, 1) (1, 1)
and 4  (1, 2)  (2, 1). as described below these alternative twists are related to the
previous ones by a reversal of the orientation of the four-manifold x.

cases (i) and (iii) lead to topological eld theories with two supercharges. one of
these (i) was considered by vafa and witten [100] in order to carry out an explicit test
of s-duality on several four-manifolds, and will be analyzed in full detail in chapter 5.
it has the unusual feature that the virtual dimension of its moduli space is exactly zero.
this feature was analysed from the perspective of balanced topological eld theories in
[25], while the underlying structure had already been anticipated within the framework
of supersymmetric quantum mechanics in [12].

case (iii) was rst discussed in [73], where it was shown to correspond to a topological
theory of complexied at gauge connections. this idea was pursued further in [14],
where a link to supersymmetric bf theories in four dimensions was established. we will
study this theory in chapter 7, where it will be shown that the theory is amphicheiral,
this meaning that the twist with either su(2)l or su(2)r leads essentially to the same
theory.

the remaining possibility (ii) leads to the half-twisted theory, a topological theory
with only one brst supercharge [114]. this feature is reminiscent of the situation in
twisted n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories, and in fact [56], the theory is a close rel-
ative of the non-abelian monopole theory [48][63][64][74], the non-abelian generalization
of wittens monopole theory [110], for the special case in which the matter elds are in
the adjoint representation of the gauge group  see chapter 6 below.

4.1 twisted n = 4 supersymmetry and the mathai-

quillen approach

in the forthcoming chapters we will analyze to exhaustion the three cases described above,
both from the viewpoint of the twisting of n = 4 supersymmetry and the mathai-quillen
approach. it is well known that topological quantum eld theories obtained after twisting

the su (2)l part of the holonomy only, the twisting is trivial, and the twisted and physical theories are
equivalent.

duality in topological quantum field theories

37

n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories can be formulated in the framework of the mathai-
quillen formalism [6][20][74]. one would expect that a similar formulation should exist for
the n = 4 case. though it turns out that this is so, there is an important issue that has to
be addressed to clarify what is meant by a mathai-quillen formulation in the latter case.
twisted n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories have an o-shell formulation such that the
topological quantum eld theory action can be expressed as a q-exact expression, where
q is the generator of the topological symmetry. actually, this is true only up to a -term.
however, the r-symmetry group of the n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories contains
a u(1) factor which becomes the ghost-number symmetry of the topological theory. but
this chiral u(1) is anomalous, so one can actually get rid of the -term with a chiral
rotation. as a result of this, the observables in the topological theory are unsensitive to
-terms up to a rescaling. what remains is just the q-exact part of the action which is
precisely the one obtained in the mathai-quillen formalism.

on the other hand, in n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theories -terms are observable.
there is no chiral anomaly and these terms can not be shifted away as in the n = 2 case.
this means that in the twisted theories one might have a dependence on the coupling
constants (in fact, this was one of the key observations in [100] to make a strong coupling
test of s-duality.) this being so we rst have to clarify what one expects to be the form
of the twisted theories in the framework of the mathai-quillen formalism. to do this let
us focus on the part of the action of a twisted theory (originated from any gauge theory
with extended supersymmetry) involving the gauge eld strength,

sx =

4e2zx

gd4x tr(f f)

(4.1)

where x is an oriented riemannian four-manifold and g a riemannian metric on it.
we are using conventions such that,

is the instanton number of the gauge conguration. using the decomposition of the eld
strength f into its self-dual and anti-selfdual parts,

f  =

(f

we see that (4.1) can be written in the following two forms:

(4.5)

what we intend to discuss here is the dierence between the two possible choices which
are present when picking up one of the components of the rotation group. it turns out
that choosing one of them, say, the left or twist t , one must consider the rst form of the
action in (4.4) since then, after working out its o-shell formulation, it can be written as

st
x =

(4.6)

(4.7)

for some  and some q. these actions correspond to an orientable four-manifold x with
a given orientation. the actions of the two twists are related in the following way:

x = s t
st

x(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

,

(4.8)

where the four-manifolds x and x are related by a reversal of orientation.

for twisted theories originated from n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories, observ-
ables do not depend on e because it appears only in a term which is q-exact. they do not
depend on  either, up to a rescaling, due to the chiral anomaly. in the case of twisted
theories n = 4 theories, however, the partition function and the observables do depend
on e and  through  . in both cases one needs to consider only one of the types of twist,
say t , since, according to (4.8), the other just leads to the observables that one would
obtain by working on x instead of x. in the rst case this statement is exact and in
the second case one must supplement it with the replacement    . therefore one
can say that up to a reversal of orientation there is only one possible twist from n = 2
supersymmetric gauge theories and three, as stated in [114] and described in detail above,
from the n = 4 theory.
after these remarks on the twisting procedure we will state what is meant by a mathai-
quillen formulation of topological quantum eld theories resulting after twisting n = 4
supersymmetric gauge theories. the mathai-quillen formulation builds out of a moduli
problem a representative of the thom class associated to the corresponding vector bundle.
this representative can always be written as an integral of the exponential of a q-exact
expression. the three twists of n = 4, after working out their o-shell formulation, can
be written as in (4.6). we will present for each case the moduli problem which in the
context of the mathai-quillen approach leads to the q-exact part of the action. in other
words, we will nd out the geometrical content which is behind each of the three twists.

4.2 string theory and twisted n = 4 topological eld

theories

this section is intended to give and overview of the known relations between string theory
and topological quantum eld theories. almost everything of what we will be saying is
well-known and nothing is new.

several isolated links between string theory and topological quantum eld theories
have been known for some time. in 1991, harvey and strominger pointed out that s-
matrix elements describing zero momentum scattering of spacetime axions o vebranes
in heterotic string theory are proportional to the donaldson polynomials [42]. indeed, the
set of ground states of n static vebranes is precisely the moduli space of n-instanton
congurations on the four-dimensional manifold transverse to the vebranes [18], and the
transitions between dierent ground states are governed by eective vertices which are
formally identical to the topological observables which represent the donaldson invariants
in the twisted n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory [104]. the eective theory describing
the dynamics and interactions of the vebranes is a six-dimensional sigma model with
target the moduli space of instantons, but one could be tempted to conjecture that the
twisted n = 2 theory could provide a dual eective description of the dynamics.

a second connection in the same direction stems from a result of taubes [96] pointing
out a relation between the seiberg-witten invariants [110], which capture the essential
topological information of many twisted four-dimensional supersymmetric theories, and
the gromov invariants, which arise in the context of two-dimensional topological sigma
models [106]. this relation has been discussed in [26] in connection with the vafa-witten
theory for g = su(2).

new, recent developments in string theory have unveiled more concrete and truly un-
expected relations. bershadsky, sadov and vafa [9], and minahan, nemschansky, vafa
and warner [82], have pointed out that the three twisted n = 4 theories appear nat-
urally in compactications of string/m theory as world-volume eective theories of iib
d-threebranes or m-vebranes wrapping supersymmetric cycles of the compactication
space. the idea is as follows  see [14][99] for a review. consider a certain compactica-
tion of type iib theory on a d-dimensional compact manifold wd, and a d3-brane with
worldvolume x4 wrapped around a supersymmetric 4-cycle of wd (this is a 4-dimensional
submanifold of wd dened by the property that a d-brane wrapping around it preserves
some supersymmetries [8].) the eective theory on the threebrane is generically an n = 4
supersymmetric gauge theory, with the six real scalars describing the position of the brane
in the ambient space. or more precisely, the scalars are sections of the normal bundle
of x4 in m10 (the 10-dimensional space where the full string theory lives), which is 6-
dimensional. but since x4 is embedded in wd, d 4 of the scalars will be twisted as they
are actually sections of the normal bundle of x4 relative to wd. now by supersymmetry,
the rest of the elds in the n = 4 multiplet will be twisted as well, so the general result is
that the eective theory is a certain twisted version of the n = 4 theory. which twisted

40

twisting the n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory

version one ends up with depends on the details of the compactication. consider for
example the vafa-witten theory. as we will see in the next chapter, the theory contains
three real scalar elds, while the remaining three are twisted to a self-dual two-form. thus
the compact space wd must be 7-dimensional. likewise, as there are two independent
twisted supersymmetries, and the d-brane generically preserves 1/2 of the supersymme-
tries left unbroken by the compactication, we need a 7 manifold preserving 1/8-th of the
supersymmetry. this is a 7-manifold of g2 holonomy, which indeed has supersymmetric
4-cycles whose normal bundle is precisely 2,+(x) (the bundle of self-dual two-forms on
x), as expected. a similar analysis [9] shows that the second twist arises in compacti-
cations on an 8-dimensional spin(7)-holonomy manifold, while the amphicheiral theory
is realized on supersymmetric cycles of su(4)-holonomy calabi-yau 4-folds. in all these
cases the structure of the normal bundle and the number of unbroken supersymmetries
agree with what is expected for each of the twisted theories.

as for the m5-brane, it is known that [24] the eective theory on a worldvolume of
the form ir4  t 2 is again the n = 4 gauge theory (the gauge coupling constant is
just the modular parameter of the torus, and the sl(2, zz)-duality of the n = 4 theory
follows simply from the sl(2, zz) action on the modular parameter of t 2.) if we now
consider more general worldvolumes of the form x  t 2, where x is a supersymmetric
cycle of a given compactication manifold, the eective theory on x should be again
a twisted n = 4 theory. this fact has been exploited in [82] to study certain six-
dimensional tensionless strings. actually, in all these cases the twisted n = 4 theories
should correspond to the long-wavelentgh limit of the eective theory on the curved
branes, whose correct description should involve a twisted version of the appropriate
born-infeld theory on the branes [40][95].

all these connections seem to suggest a deep relation between string theory and topo-
logical eld theories which would be worth to study in the future. the most promising
avenue to explore and exploit these connections seems to be the recent ads/cft con-
jecture [38][71][112]  see [54] for a review. gopakumar and vafa [36][37] have recently
shown that in the large n (t hooft) limit, the chern-simons theory is dual to a certain
topological closed string theory. as for the twisted n = 4 theories, no real progress has
been made so far (but see [47][113], where some interestings issues in this direction are
addressed.)

chapter 5

the vafa-witten theory

in this chapter we will concentrate on the rst of the topological theories that can be
constructed by twisting the n = 4 theory. the twisted theory, for gauge group su(2),
was considered by vafa and witten [100] to carry out an explicit test of s-duality on
several four-manifolds. the partition function of this theory computes, under certain
circumstances, the euler characteristic of instanton moduli spaces, making it possible to
x, by comparing with known mathematical results, several unknown modular functions
which can not be determined otherwise. the nal computation requires the introduction
of a clever mass perturbation which, while breaking down the n = 4 supersymmetry
of the physical theory down to n = 1, still preserves one of the topological symmetries
of the theory. a similar approach was introduced by witten in [109] to obtain the rst
explicit results for the donaldson-witten theory just before the far more powerful seiberg-
witten approach was available. however, this approach is restricted to kahler manifolds
with b+
2 > 1. vafa and witten conjectured that, in the case of the theory at hand, the
perturbation does not aect the nal result for the partition function. we will carefully
analyze and conrm their conjecture and extend their computation to gauge group su(n),
with n prime.

5.1 the twisted theory

after the twisting, the symmetry group of the theory becomes h = su(2)l  su(2)r 
su(2)f , where su(2)f is a subgroup of su(4)i that commutes with the splitting 4 
(2, 1)  (2, 1) and remains in the theory as a residual isospin group. under h, the
supercharges split up as,

qv

  qi, qi

,

qv   qi
 ,

(5.1)

where the index i labels the fundamental representation of su(2)f . the twist has pro-
duced two scalar supercharges, the su(2)f doublet qi. these scalar charges are dened

41

42

the vafa-witten theory

in terms of the original supercharges as follows:

qi=1  qv=1
qi=2  qv=3

=1 + qv=2
=2,
=1 + qv=4
=2.

the elds of the n = 4 multiplet decompose under h as follows:

a   a ,
v  i, i,
v
  i
uv  ij, g.

,

(5.2)

(5.3)

notice that the elds i
 and g are symmetric in their spinor indices and therefore
can be regarded as components of self-dual two-forms. ij is also symmetric in its isospin
indices and thus transforms in the representation 3 of su(2)f . some of the denitions in
(5.3) need clarication. our choices for the anticommuting elds are,

i=1() = 

i=1 = v=1,=2  v=2,=1,

i=1,=1,2



= v=1,2

,



i=1(11) = v=1,=1,
i=1(12) = 1
...

2(v=1,=2 + v=2,=1),

the qi-transformations of the twisted theory can be readily obtained from the corre-

where, for example, (ij) = 1

algebra [1, 2] = 0 modulo a non-abelian gauge transformation generated by the scalars
j[ij, g]. the algebra closes on-shell, and

{q1, q1} = g(22),
{q1, q2} = g(12),
{q2, q2} = g(11),

(5.9)

where by g(22) we denote the non-abelian gauge transformation generated by 22. as
explained in [114], it is possible to realize the algebra o-shell by inserting the auxiliary

elds n (symmetric in its spinor indices) and m  in the transformations of i
  and

theory, where an o-shell formulation in terms of unconstrained elds is not possible.

the next step is to couple the theory to an arbitrary background metric g of eu-

(5.14)

where we have introduced the full covariant derivative d . the action (5.14) is, by
construction, invariant under the appropriate covariantized version of the transformations
(5.11). however, it is not manifestly real because it contains elds in the fundamental
representation of su(2)f , which are complex, and it is not possible to assign a non-trivial
ghost number to the elds in (5.14). now, the action of a topological cohomological
eld theory has to be real, since we will eventually interpret it as a real dierential form
dened on a certain moduli space. likewise, it has to posses a non-trivial ghost-number
symmetry which, from the geometrical viewpoint, corresponds to the de rham grading
on the moduli space.

to overcome these problems we break the su(2)f internal symmetry group of the
theory down to its cartan subgroup. this allows to introduce a non-anomalous ghost
number in the theory (basically twice the corresponding charge under the diagonal gen-
erator t3). with respect to this ghost number, the eld content of the theory can be
reorganized as follows (we follow the notation in [100]): with ghost number +2, we have
the scalar eld   11; with ghost number +1, the anticommuting elds    i1 ,
  1 and   i1; with ghost number 0, the gauge connection a , the scalar eld
c  i12, the self-dual two-form b  g and the auxiliary elds h  in and
h   m ; with ghost number 1, the anticommuting elds   i2,    2 
and   2; and nally, with ghost number 2, the scalar eld   22. these elds are

5.2 the topological action in the mathai-quillen ap-

proach

we have described so far the vafa-witten theory as a twisted version of the n = 4 theory.
the twisting procedure has been repeatedly shown to be a very powerful technique for
the construction of topological quantum eld theories. however, it suers from serious
drawbacks, the main one being that it is not possible to identify from the very beginning
the underlying geometrical structure that is involved. rather, in most of the cases the
underlying geometrical scenario is unveiled only after a careful analysis with techniques
borrowed from conventional quantum eld theory is carried out [104]. in what follows,
we will change our scope and try to concentrate on the geometrical formulation of the
theory. we will make use of the mathai-quillen formalism (see chapter 2), which is very
well suited for our purposes. let us recall briey the fundamentals of this approach.
in the framework of topological quantum eld theories of cohomological type [107], one
deals with a certain set of elds (the eld space, m), on which the action of a symmetry
group, g, which is usually a local symmetry group, is dened. an appropriate set of
basic equations imposed on the elds singles out a certain subset (the moduli space) of
m/g. the topological quantum eld theory associated to this moduli problem studies
intersection theory on the corresponding moduli space. in this context, the mathai-quillen
formalism involves the following steps. given the eld space m, the basic equations of

50

the vafa-witten theory

the problem are introduced as sections of an appropriate vector bundle v  m, in such a
way that the zero locus of these sections, modded out by the gauge symmetry, is precisely
the relevant moduli space. the mathai-quillen formalism allows the computation of a
certain representative of the thom class of the vector bundle e = v/g, which turns out
to be the exponential of the action of the topological eld theory under consideration.
the integration on m of the pullback under the sections of the thom class of v gives the
euler characteristic of the bundle, which is the basic topological invariant associated to
the moduli problem.

5.2.1 the vafa-witten problem

the analysis starts from two basic equations involving the self-dual part of the gauge
connection f +, a certain scalar eld c and a bosonic self-dual two-form b+, all taking
values in the adjoint representation of some compact nite-dimensional lie group g.
these equations are:

(dc + 2db+
  i
f +

 , b+

2[b+

 = 0,
]  i2

[b+

, c] = 0.

(5.28)

one can consider the equations above as dening a certain moduli problem, and our
aim is to construct the topological quantum eld theory which corresponds to it within
the framework of the mathai-quillen formalism. our analysis will follow closely that in
[62][63][74]. it should be pointed out that the mathai-quillen construction for this twist
was already contained, yet not explicitly constructed, in [100], and was also studied in
the context of balanced topological eld theories by dijkgraaf and moore in [25], while
the basic structure had already been discussed from the viewpoint of supersymmetric
quantum mechanics by blau and thompson in [12].

recently, the mathai-quillen formalism has been applied to the twist under consid-
eration in [102]. the construction presented in that work diers from ours in the role
assigned to the eld c.

5.2.2 the topological framework

the geometrical setting is a certain oriented, compact riemannian four-manifold x, and
the eld space is m = a0(x, adp )2,+(x, adp ), where a is the space of connections
on a principal g-bundle p  x, and the second and third factors denote, respectively,
the 0-forms and self-dual dierential forms of degree two on x taking values in the lie
algebra of g. adp denotes the adjoint bundle of p , p ad g. the space of sections of this
bundle, 0(x, adp ), is the lie algebra of the group g of gauge transformations (vertical

duality in topological quantum field theories

51

automorphisms) of the bundle p , whose action on the eld space is given locally by:

g(a) = i(dg)g1 + gag1,
g(c) = gcg1,

g(b+) = gb+g1,

(5.29)

where c  0(x, adp ) and b+  2,+(x, adp ). in terms of the covariant derivative,
da = d + i[a, ], the innitesimal form of the transformations (5.29), with g = exp(i)
and   0(x, adp ), takes the form:

g()a = da,
g()c = i[c, ],
g()b+ = i[b+, ].

(5.30)

tr(  ) +zx

the tangent space to the eld space at the point (a, c, b+) is the vector space
t(a,c,b+)m = 1(x, adp )  0(x, adp )  2,+(x, adp ). on t(a,c,b+)m we can dene
a gauge-invariant riemannian metric (inherited from that on x) as follows:
h(, , +), (, , +)i =zx
where ,   1(x, adp ), ,   0(x, adp ) and +, +  2,+(x, adp ).
to introduce the basic equations (5.28) in this framework we proceed as follows. on
the eld space m we build a trivial vector bundle v = m  f , where the bre is in this
case f = 1(x, adp )  2,+(x, adp ). the basic equations (5.28) can then be identied
to be a section s : m  v of the vector bundle v. in our case, the section reads, with a
certain choice of normalization that makes easier the comparison with the results in the
rst part of the chapter:

tr(  ) +zx

tr( +  +)

(5.31)

s(a, c, b+) =(cid:0)2(dc + 2db+

), 2(f +

 

i
2

[b+

 , b+

] 

i
2

[b+

, c])(cid:1).

(5.32)

notice that this section is gauge ad-equivariant, and the zero locus of the associated
section s : m/g  v/g = e gives precisely the moduli space of the topological theory.
it would be desirable to compute the dimension of this moduli space. the best we can
do is to build the corresponding deformation complex whose index is known to compute,
under certain assumptions, the dimension of the tangent space to the moduli space. this
index provides what is called the virtual dimension of the moduli space. the deformation
complex that corresponds to our moduli space is the following:

0  0(x, adp )

c1(x, adp )  0(x, adp )  2,+(x, adp )

ds1(x, adp )  2,+(x, adp )  0.

the map c : 0(x, adp )  tm, given by (recall (5.30)):

c() = (da, i[c, ], i[b+, ]),   0(x, adp ),

(5.34)

denes the vertical tangent space (gauge orbits) to the principal g-bundle. the map
ds : t(a,c,b+)m  f is given by the linearization of the basic equations (5.28)

under suitable conditions (which happen to be the same vanishing theorems discussed in
[100]), the index of the complex (5.33) computes de dimension of ker(ds)/im(c), that is,
the dimension of the moduli space under consideration. to calculate its index, the complex
(5.33) can be split up into the atiyah-hitchin-singer instanton deformation complex [4]
for anti-self-dual (asd) connections,

(1) 0  0(x, adp )

da1(x, adp )

p+da2,+(x, adp )  0,

(5.36)

and the complex associated to the operator,

(2) d = p+da + da : 0(x, adp )  2,+(x, adp )  1(x, adp ),

(5.37)

which is also the asd instanton deformation complex. they contribute with opposite
signs and therefore the net contribution to the index is zero, leaving us with the result
that the virtual dimension of the moduli space is zero.

5.2.3 the topological action

we now proceed to construct the topological action associated to this moduli problem,
and we will do it within the mathai-quillen formalism. the mathai-quillen form gives
a representative of the thom class of the bundle e = m g f , and the integration over
m/g of the pullback of this thom class under the section s : m/g  e = m g f
gives the (generalized) euler characteristic of e, which is to be identied, from the eld-
theory point of view, with the partition function of the associated topological quantum
eld theory.

as a rst step to construct the topological theory which corresponds to the moduli
problem dened by the basic equations (5.28), we have to give explicitly the eld content
and the brst symmetry of the theory. this will help to clarify the structure of the
topological multiplet we introduced in sect. 2. in the eld space m = a  0(x, adp )

2,+(x, adp ) we have the gauge connection a, the scalar eld c and the self-dual two-
form b+
, all with ghost number 0. in the (co)tangent space t(a,c,b+)m = 1(x, adp )
0(x, adp )2,+(x, adp ) we have the anticommuting elds ,  and +
, all with ghost
number 1 and which are to be interpreted as dierential forms on the moduli space. in the
bre f = 1(x, adp )  2,+(x, adp ) we have anticommuting elds with the quantum
numbers of the equations, namely a one-form  and a self-dual two-form +
, both with
ghost number 1, and their superpartners, a commuting one-form h and a commuting
self-dual two-form h +
, both with ghost number 0 and which appear as auxiliary elds
in the associated eld theory. and nally, associated to the gauge symmetry, we have a
commuting scalar eld   0(x, adp ) with ghost number +2 [107], and a multiplet of
scalar elds  (commuting and with ghost number 2) and  (anticommuting and with
ghost number 1), both also in 0(x, adp ) and which enforce the horizontal projection
m  m/g [20]. the brst symmetry of the model is given by:
{q, } = d,
{q,  } = i [c, ],
{q, +

} = i [b+

[q, b+

,
[q, ] = ,

[q, h] = i [ , ],
[q, h +
, ],
{q,  } = i [ , ].

] = i [+

(5.38)

the brst generator q satises the algebra {q, q} = g(), and can be seen to correspond
to the cartan model for the g-equivariant cohomology of m .
we are now ready to write the action for the topological eld theory under consider-
ation. instead of writing the full expression for the mathai-quillen form, we dene the
action to be {q, } for some appropriate gauge invariant gauge fermion  [20]. the use
of gauge fermions was introduced in the context of topological quantum eld theory in
[68] (see [10] for a review). as is explained in detail in [20], the gauge fermion consists
of two basic pieces, a localization gauge fermion, which essentially involves the equations
dening the moduli problem and which in our case takes the form:

loc = h( , +), s(a, c, b+)i + h( , +), ( h, h +)i

(5.39)

and a projection gauge fermion, which enforces the horizontal projection, and which can

54

be written as:

the vafa-witten theory

proj = h ,c(, , )ig,

(5.40)
where h,ig denotes the gauge invariant metric in 0(x, adp ), and the map c : tm 
0(x, adp ) is the adjoint of the map c (5.34) with respect to the riemannian metrics
(5.31) in tm and 0(x, adp ). the adjoint of c() is readily computed to be:

c+(, , ) = d +

i
2

[ +

 , b+] + i[, c],

(5.41)

proj =zx

where (, , )  t(a,c,b+)m. this leaves for the projection fermion (5.40) the expression:
(5.42)

[ +

g tr(cid:8) (cid:0) d +

i
2

, b+] + i[, c](cid:1)(cid:9).

in the mathai-quillen formalism the action is built out of the terms (5.39) and (5.42).
however, as in the case of the mathai-quillen formulation of donaldson-witten theory
[6], one must add another piece to the gauge fermion to make full contact with the
corresponding twisted supersymmetric theory. in our case, this extra term is:

extra = zx

[, ](cid:9).

it is now straightforward to see that after the rescalings

(5.44)
and with the identication q  q+ we recover, in terms of the primed elds, the twisted
model we analyzed in the rst part of the chapter and that is encoded in (5.23) and (5.26).
and what about q? what is its role in this game? in fact, the theory admits two
mathai-quillen descriptions, related to each other by the weyl group of su(2)f , in such
a way that the roles of q+ and q are interchanged, as are the roles of  and , + and
+,  and , and  and . the corresponding moduli space is dened by eqs. (5.28) with
the substitution c  c, and the theory localizes  as was proved in [100]  actually on
the intersection of both moduli spaces, which is dened by the equations

duality in topological quantum field theories

55

alternatively, one can consider both q+ and q at once within the framework of what
dijkgraaf and moore [25] have called the equivariant cohomology of iterated superspaces.
the resulting topological eld theories have two brst operators d and the virtual
dimension of the corresponding moduli spaces is zero. the simplifying property of this
type of theories is that the topological action can be derived (up to theta terms) from an
action potential f

s = d+df ,

(5.46)

 this is just the content of eq. (5.12). f is a kind of morse function on eld space, and
under certain assumptions the path integral can be seen to localize to the critical points
of f [25].

5.3 observables

in this section we will analyze the structure of the possible topological observables of the
theory. observables are operators which are q-invariant but are not q-exact. a quick
look at either the q+ or q transformations shows that the observables are basically the
same as in the ordinary donaldson-witten theory. indeed, from (5.23) or (5.38) one nds
that the trio a,  and  transforms such as to ensure that the operators

w0 =tr(2),

w1 = 

2tr(  ),

satisfy the descent equations,

which as we know imply that,

(5.47)

(5.48)

(5.49)

being j homology cycles of x, are observables. of course, as usual, this set can be
enlarged for gauge groups possessing other independent casimirs besides the quadratic
one. we can also build a similar set of observables o(j ) in the cohomology of q by
exchanging  by  and  by . while the observables o(j ) have positive ghost numbers
given by 4  j, the observables o(j ) have negative ghost numbers j  4. the unusual
feature to the rst twist is that the ghost number symmetry is non-anomalous. this means
essentially that the only vacuum expectation values which are non-vanishing are those
containing sets of observables with zero overall ghost number. although very appealing,

56

the vafa-witten theory

the idea of combining observables from the q+ and q cohomologies with opposite ghost
numbers to get non-zero vacuum expectation values is not useful. the reason is that, for
these combined operators to be truly topological invariants, they must lie simultaneously
in the cohomologies of both q+ and q. the only possible candidate appears to be
the theta-term, which does not lead to any new invariant. hence, the only non-trivial
observable is the partition function itself. notice that the topological action splits as

s = {q+, }  2ik0,

(5.50)

now, owing to (5.50), the partition function depends on the microscopic couplings e0
and 0 only through the combination 2ik0, and in particular this dependence is a priori
holomorphic (were the orientation of the manifold x reversed, the partition function would
depend anti-holomorphically on 0). however there could be situations in which, because
of some sort of holomorphic anomaly, the partition function would acquire an explicit
anomalous dependence on 0. this seems to be the case, for example, for the theory
dened on cip2 [100] and, more generally, on manifolds with b+
2 = 1 [82]. somewhat
related results have been derived for the donaldson-witten theory in the context of the
u-plane formalism [84].

but (5.50) has also far-reaching consequences on the structure of the partition function,

which can be written as

z(0) =xk

zk e2ik0,

(5.51)

where zk is the partition function computed with action {q+, } at xed instanton
number k. now since the zk do not depend on e0, one can take the weak-coupling limit
e0  0 where the computations are given exactly by a saddle-point calculation around
the bosonic background dened by the vafa-witten equations (5.28). unfortunately, it
is not possible to perform explicit computations from this viewpoint: the moduli space is
non-compact, and no precise recipe is known to properly compactify it. the way out is to
exploit the metric independence of the partition function to go to the long-distance limit
and compute in terms of the low-energy degrees of freedom of the physical theory. for
the vafa-witten theory this is the n = 1 theory which results from giving bare masses to
the chiral multiplets of the n = 4 theory. in what follows we will review the construction
thoroughly and apply it to the computation of the partition function for gauge group
su(n).

5.4 mass perturbations and reduction to n = 1
it is a well-known fact that on complex manifolds the exterior dierential d splits into
the dolbeaut operators  and , and that this splitting is completely eective on kahler
manifolds, where the de rham cohomology is equivalent to the cohomology of . in a
similar way, as pointed out in [109], on a kahler manifold the number of brst charges

duality in topological quantum field theories

57

of a twisted supersymmetric theory is doubled, in such a way that, for example, the
donaldson-witten theory has an enhanced nt = 2 topological symmetry, while the vafa-
witten theory has a nt = 4 topological symmetry. in each case, one of the brst charges
comes from the underlying n = 1 subalgebra which corresponds to the formulation of
the physical theory in n = 1 superspace. by suitably adding mass terms for some of
the chiral superelds in the theory, one can break the extended (n = 2 or n = 4)
supersymmetry of the physical theory down to n = 1. for the reason sketched above,
the corresponding twisted massive theory on kahler manifolds should still retain at least
one topological symmetry. one now exploits the metric independence of the topological
theory. by scaling up the metric in the topological theory, g  tg, one can take the
limit t  . in this limit, the metric on x becomes nearly at, and it is reasonable that
the computations in the topological eld theory can be performed in terms of the vacuum
structure of the n = 1 theory.
one could wonder as to what the eect of the perturbation may be. the introduction
of a mass perturbation may (and in general will) distort the original topological eld
theory. this poses no problem in the case of the donaldson-witten theory, as witten
was able to prove that the perturbation is topologically trivial, in the sense that it aects
the theory in an important but controllable way [109]. as for the vafa-witten theory
[26][58][100], we will see below that the twisted massive theory is topological on kahler
four-manifolds with h2,0 6= 0, and the partition function is actually invariant under the
perturbation.
in what follows we will make use of the transformations generated by q+ only, which

we rewrite as follows

[q+, ] = 2 ,
{q+,  } = 2i [ , ],
{q+,  } = h  + 2s ,
[q+, h ] = 22i [  , ] 
{q+, +

(5.52)

(5.53)

written in this form (compare with (5.23)), the on-shell transformations are simply

obtained by setting h +

 = 0 = h  in (5.52).

58

the vafa-witten theory

notice that s  and s are precisely the components of the section (5.32) which
denes the vafa-witten theory in the mathai-quillen approach. now it is easy to see
why the theory localizes to eld congurations satisfying (5.28). according to wittens
xed-point theorem, the contributions to the partition function of the theory, which is the
only non-trivial observable owing to the vanishing of the ghost number anomaly, come
from the xed points of the brst symmetry. but according to (5.52), the xed points
are precisely (with the auxiliary elds set to zero) s  = 0 = s.

one of the main ingredients in the analysis in [100] is the existence, on certain four-
manifolds (basically of the kahler type), of a suitable vanishing theorem which guarantees
that all the solutions to eqs. (5.28) are of the form:

f +
 = 0, b+

 = 0, c = 0,

(5.54)

that is, that the moduli space reduces to the moduli space of asd connections. in fact,
under these circumstances, the partition function of the theory computes, for each value
of the instanton number, the euler characteristic of the corresponding instanton moduli
space. observe that the vanishing theorem allows only positive instanton numbers to con-
tribute to the partition function; the presence of negative instanton number contributions
would signal a failure of the vanishing theorem.

on a four-dimensional kahler manifold the holonomy group is contained in su(2)r 
u(1)l, where u(1)l is a certain subgroup of su(2)l. under this reduction of the holon-
omy, left-handed spinors  decompose into pieces 1 and 2 of opposite u(1)l charges,
in such a way that if the manifold is also spin, the spinor bundle s+ has a decompo-
sition s+  k
2 is some square root of the canonical bundle of x,
c t x. following [109], we can pick a complex structure on x by taking the
1-forms ()1 dx to be of type (1, 0), and the 1-forms ()2 dx of type (0, 1). with
this choice, the self-dual 2-form ()dx  dx can be regarded as a (2, 0)-form for
 =  = 1, as a (0, 2)-form for  =  = 2, and as a (1, 1)-form for  = 1,  = 2. this
decomposition corresponds to the splitting 2,+(x) = 2,0(x) 0,2(x) 0(x), valid
on any kahler surface ( stands for the kahler form).
with respect to the complex structure of the manifold, the elds of the theory naturally
split into objects that can be thought of as components of forms of type (p, q). for
example, the connection 1-form a () dx splits up into a (1, 0)-form a2 () 
1 dx
and a (0, 1)-form a1 () 
()dx  dx gives
rise to a (2, 0)-form b+
11()22dx  dx and a (1, 1)-
form for b+
12()12dx  dx = b+
11 would
correspond to the (0, 2)-form , b+
12 to the 0-form b in [100].
note that the eld b+
12 can be thought of as a scalar eld on x. in fact, we shall see

in a moment that it naturally combines with the scalar eld c into two complex scalars
12  ic. something similar happens with the other self-dual 2-forms + and +.

let us recall that in our conventions the brst operators q are obtained from the
n = 4 supercharges qv

q+ = q3

q = i(q1

2).

(5.55)

in the kahler case, each of the individual components q1
2 is well-dened
under the holonomy su(2)r  u(1)l. it is therefore possible to dene four charges, of
which only q4
2 is related to the underlying construction in n = 1 superspace. hence, it
is the only topological symmetry that should be expected to survive after the mass terms
are plugged in.

we now turn to the discussion of the possible ways of (softly) breaking n = 4 supersym-
metry by suitably adding mass terms for the chiral multiplets. let us consider rst the
situation that arises on a at ir4. by adding a bare mass term for just one of the chiral

duality in topological quantum field theories

multiplets, say 1,

l(1) = mz d4xd2tr(1)2 + h.c.,

61

(5.60)

n = 4 supersymmetry is broken down to n = 1. the corresponding low-energy eective
theory, at scales below m, is n = 1 supersymmetric qcd, with su(2) as gauge group,
coupled to two massless chiral superelds in the adjoint representation with a (tree-level)
quartic superpotential induced by integrating out the massive supereld. as shown in
[49], this theory has a moduli space of vacua where both a coulomb and a higgs phase
coexist. on the other hand, equal bare mass terms for two of the chiral multiplets,

l(2) = mz d4xd2tr(12) + h.c.,

preserve n = 2 supersymmetry, whereas if the mass terms are dierent:

l(2) = m1z d4xd2tr(1)2 + m2z d4xd2tr(2)2 + h.c.,

(5.61)

(5.62)

n = 4 supersymmetry is again broken down to n = 1. however, both theories ow in
the infrared to a pure n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory, which has a moduli space of
vacua in the coulomb phase. finally, mass terms for the three chiral multiplets, no matter
whether the mass parameters are equal or not, preserve only n = 1 supersymmetry. of
the three inequivalent ways of breaking n = 4 supersymmetry down to n = 1, we must
choose the one in terms of which the analysis of the vacuum structure of the resultant
n = 1 theory is simplest. the appropriate choice is [100]

l(3) = mz d4xd2tr(cid:0)(1)2 + (2)2 + (3)2(cid:1) + h.c.,

(5.63)

in terms of which the classical vacua of the resulting n = 1 theory can be classied by
the complex conjugacy classes of homomorphisms of the su(2) lie algebra to that of g.
in the case that g = su(2), for example, there are three discrete vacua, corresponding
to the three singularities of the mass-deformed n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory with
gauge group su(2) [93].
on general curved manifolds the naive construction sketched above simply does not
work. as explained in [100][109], superpotentials of a twisted theory on kahler manifolds
must transform as (2, 0)-forms. this comes about as follows. let us consider the situation
for n = 2 theories, as it turns out that all the other cases can be reduced to it. a general
superpotential can be written in n = 1 superspace as

z d4xd2  w + h.c.,

(5.64)

where w is an anti-holomorphic function of the chiral superelds. now, viewed as part of
i , i = 1, 2), the measure d2  carries an
the n = 2 superspace (with coordinates i

 and

su(2)i index, d2  = d2 d2
, and therefore after the twist on a kahler four-manifold it
carries non-trivial charge under u(1)l. in fact, after the twist d2  becomes a (2, 0)-form
according to the above conventions, so w must be a (0, 2)-form on x, and therefore w
must be a (2, 0)-form as stated.
now, according to our conventions, two of the chiral superelds, 1 and 3 (whose
12  ic and ,  resp.) are scalars in the twisted model, while
scalar components are b+
the third one, 2 (whose scalar components are b+
22), is a (2, 0)-form. a suitable
mass term for 2 and one of the other scalar superelds, say 1, can be readily written
down and reads:

11 and b+

l(m) = mzx

d2tr(12) + h.c.

(5.65)

in (5.65) m is just a (constant) mass parameter. a mass term for the remaining supereld
3 requires the introduction of the (2, 0)-form1  [109]:

l() =zx

  d2zd2tr(3)2 + h.c.

(5.66)

therefore we now turn to studying the eect of the following mass terms for the chiral

multiplets 1, 2 and 3:

l(m, ) = mzx
+ zx

d2tr(12) + mzx
d2tr(3)2 +zx

d2 tr(12)

d2  tr(3)2,

(5.67)

where, for simplicity,  = 11 = ()11   stands for the only non-vanishing com-
ponent of the (2, 0)-form , while  = 22 = 11 stands for the only non-vanishing
component of the (0, 2)-form  conjugate to .

the q1 transformations (5.57), which are the only ones to survive the perturbation a

tions which stem from (5.71) are precisely the f -atness conditions as derived from the
superpotential

i2tr (1[2, 3]) + mtr (12) + tr(3)2.

(5.72)

we can analyse eqs. (5.71) following [100]. they admit a trivial solution b+

12 =
c =  = 0, where the gauge group is unbroken and which reduces at low energies to the

11 = b+

64

the vafa-witten theory

11, b+

n = 1 pure su(n) gauge theory (which has n discrete vacua). in addition to this trivial
vacuum, eqs. (5.71) admit a non-trivial xed point (the irreducible embedding in [100])
in which , and therefore b+
12 and c, are not zero. on at space-time this solution
corresponds to a higgs vacuum in which the gauge group is completely broken. all these
vacua have a mass gap: the irreducible embedding is a higgs vacuum, while the presence
of a mass gap in the trivial vacua is a well-known feature of the n = 1 sym theory.
when n is prime, these are the only relevant vacua of the n = 1 theory. there are
other, more general, solutions to (5.71) which leave dierent subgroups of g unbroken.
however, in all these solutions the unbroken gauge group contains u(1) factors and one
expects on general grounds that they should not contribute to the partition function [100].
on the other hand, when n is not prime, there are additional contributions coming from
embeddings for which the unbroken gauge group is su(d), where d is a positive divisor of
d. the low-energy theory is again an n = 1 su(d) gauge theory wihout matter with d
massive discrete vacua. now in the long-distance limit, the partition function is given as
a nite sum over the contributions of the discrete massive vacua of the resulting n = 1
theory. for g = su(n) the number of such vacua is given by the sum of the positive
divisors of n [27]. the contribution of each vacuum is universal (because of the mass
gap), and can be xed by comparing to known mathematical results [100].

this analysis is valid only on hyper-kahler manifolds, as in this situation one can
pick a section of h (2,0) which vanishes nowhere. on more general kahler manifolds, this
picture must be corrected near the zeroes of the two-form  along the lines proposed in
[100][109].

with the mass terms added, the action s + l(m, ) is only invariant under q(m,)
.
to deal with the mass terms proportional to m, we shall proceed as follows. we will
modify the q2 transformations by appropriately introducing mass terms (proportional to
m), in such a way that q+(m) = q(m)
(with mass m, and  = 0 at this stage) be
a symmetry of the original action plus mass perturbations. we will show this by proving
that l + l(m,  = 0) is actually q+(m)-exact. to this end we make the replacements:

in this way, q+(m) closes on h1 , 1  with q = 1, and on h2 , 2  with q = +1.

(5.86)

moreover, as the m mass term does not enter in any of the above calculations, the results
also hold for q+(m).

the preceding analysis implies that if we denote vacuum expectation values in the
twisted theory (which has topological symmetry q+and action l) by h. . .i, in the com-
pletely perturbed theory (with action l + l(m, ) and symmetry q(m,)
) by h. . .im,,
and in the equivariantly extended theory (with action l + l(m) and symmetry q+(m))
by h. . .im, the situation for the partition function is the following:

1

h1im, =(cid:10)ej()el(m)(cid:11) =(cid:10)ej()(cid:11)m .

(5.87)

in the rst equality we have discarded the q(m,)

-exact term (5.83). notice that it is
also possible, for the same reason, to discard the terms in (5.79) and (5.80). this leaves
the q(m,)

(5.88)

notice that (1) has ghost number 2, while j() has ghost number +2. also l + (1)
is q+(m)-closed (in fact it is q+(m)-exact up to a -term). hence, we can trade j() for
{q+(m),  } + i() and discard the q+(m)-exact piece in (5.85). we are left with the
action

(5.89)

now, as noted in [109] in a closely related context, i() (or rather j()) is the f -term
of the chiral supereld 3; therefore, it cannot develop a vacuum expectation value if
supersymmetry is to remain unbroken. strictly speaking, this applies to h22i. as for
the remaining term [b+
22], one can readily check that it vanishes on the moduli
space. hence,

12  ic, b+

(cid:10)ei()(cid:11)m = h1im =de(1)e .

(5.90)

finally, since (1) has ghost number 2, its vev in the original theory must vanish
as well, if the ghost number symmetry is to remain unbroken. hence, under these as-
sumptions, the partition function is indeed invariant under the perturbation as stated in
[100].

68

the vafa-witten theory

5.4.3 equivariant extension of the thom form

on kahler manifolds there is a u(1) symmetry (5.59) acting on the moduli space. this
symmetry was already noted in [100] within the discussion of the vanishing theorem,
which guarantees localization on the moduli space of asd connections, but not further
use of it was made. we have discussed it in the previous section in connection with the
mass perturbations. its action on the dierent elds is the following:

the gauge eld a, the antighosts +

(5.92)

from the viewpoint of the mathai-quillen formalism, the unperturbed twisted theory
provides a representation of the g-equivariant de rham cohomology (in the cartan model)
on the moduli space. however, the formulation is not equivariant with respect to the u(1)
action. in other words, the perturbed action is not invariant (i.e. it is not equivariantly
closed) under the unperturbed twisted supercharge. on the other hand, it is invariant
under the perturbed twisted supercharge. in fact, the twisted supercharge q+(m) of the
perturbed theory can be interpreted as the generator of the u(1)-equivariant extension of
the g-equivariant de rham cohomology on the moduli space. this connection between
massive extensions of twisted supersymmetric theories and equivariant cohomology was
exploited in [65], where the explicit construction leading to the idea of the equivariant
extension was carried out in detail. in what follows, we will try to adapt the construction
in [65] to our problem. we intend to be as sketchy as possible, and therefore refer the
reader to the work cited above for the minute details of the construction.

the idea underlying the construction is the following. prior to the perturbation, we
have a topological eld theory which admits a mathai-quillen description with brst
charge q+. this means, among other things, that the corresponding lagrangian is a
q+-commutator. after adding the mass terms proportional to m, it is possible to modify
the q+ transformation laws so that the perturbed lagrangian can be written as a q+(m)-
commutator as well, where q+(m) are the modied topological transformations. in view
of this, it would be tempting to assume that there has to be a standard mathai-quillen

duality in topological quantum field theories

69

construction associated to the new topological theory. however, the perturbation has not
changed the geometrical setting of the problem, so there is a priori no reason why the
mathai-quillen formulation should change at all. in fact, it does not, and it turns out
that the perturbed theory admits no standard mathai-quillen formulation. however, as
pointed out in [65], the formalism allows a natural generalization in those situations in
which there is an additional symmetry group acting on the moduli space. the geometrical
construction involved is an equivariant extension [5] of the thom form of e within the
framework of the mathai-quillen formalism.

the mathai-quillen formalism provides an explicit representative of the thom form
of the oriented vector bundle e = m g f . the bundle e is awkward to work with, and
it is preferable to work equivariantly, i.e. to regard e explicitly as an associated vector
bundle to the g-principal vector bundle m  f  e. the mathai-quillen representative
of the thom form of e is g-equivariantly closed and basic on mf (and hence descends
naturally to e). in the weil model for the g-equivariant cohomology of e, the mathai-
quillen form is an element in w(g)  (f ) (w(g) is the weil algebra of g) given by
[20]:

u = e|x|2z d exp  1

4

ikijj + ii(dxi + ijxj)!.

(5.93)

in (5.93) xi are orthonormal coordinates on the bre f , and dxi are their corresponding
dierentials. the i are grassmann orthonormal coordinates for the bre, while k and 
are the generators of w(g). the chern-weil homomorphism, which essentially substitutes
the universal realizations k and  by the actual curvature and connection in mf , gives
the link between the universal representative u and the thom form (e). the important
point is that while u is g-equivariantly closed by construction, it is not equivariantly
closed with respect to the u(1) action.
it seems natural to look for a redenition of
the representative (5.93), which is u(1)-equivariantly closed. the equivariant extension
of u with respect to the u(1) action simply amounts to nding a suitable form p such
that u + p is u(1)-equivariantly closed [5]. within the framework of the mathai-quillen
formalism this amounts to replacing the curvature k with a new equivariant curvature
ku (1) [65], which is just the original curvature 2-form k plus an operator l involving
the innitesimal u(1) action and the connection 1-form . in the cartan model, which
is the best suited to topological eld theories, the connection form is set to zero, and
hence the equivariant extension of the curvature is just the original one plus an operator
implementing the innitesimal u(1) action. this may sound rather abstract, so we now
proceed to the actual construction. the main ingredients are a u(1) action dened on
the moduli space and the bre f , under which the metrics on both the moduli space and
the bre must be invariant, while the section s : m  v has to transform equivariantly;
that is, if mt and ft denote the action of u(1) on m and f respectively, then

s  mt = ft

 s

(5.94)

70

the vafa-witten theory

this can be easily veried in the present problem in view of the form of s (5.53) and
the u(1) actions (5.91). as for the metrics, it suces to show that for two vector elds
(0, x +, x) and (0, y +, y), their scalar product is invariant under the u(1) action (5.91).
according to our conventions, trx +
y + = 4trx y , so a natural denition for the
metric on the eld space would be as follows (h|i denotes the scalar product on tm):

(cid:10)(0, x +, x)|(0, y +, y)(cid:11) = zx

(5.95)

which is indeed invariant under the u(1) action.

to incorporate the u(1) action to the mathai-quillen construction for the theory,
we modify the q+ transformations of the ghosts and the auxiliary elds charged under
u(1) by replacing the curvature  with its equivariant extension (t) =  + lt, where
lt generates on the elds an innitesimal u(1) transformation. according to (5.91), this

5.5 the partition function for g = su (n )

in this section we will consider the vafa-witten theory for gauge group su(n). as all
the elds are in the adjoint representation of the gauge group, it is possible to consider
non-trivial gauge congurations in su(n)/zzn and compute the partition function for a
xed value of the t hooft ux v  h 2(x, zzn ). we know that the twisted n = 4 super-
symmetric action breaks up into a q+-exact piece plus a topological term proportional to
the instanton number of the gauge conguration,

stwisted = {q+, }  2ikv0,

(5.99)

kv = 

n  1
2n

v  v mod zz,

with kv the instanton number of a gauge bundle with t hooft ux v. this is an integer
for su(n) bundles (v = 0), but for non-trivial su(n)/zzn bundles with v 6= 0 one has
(5.100)

where v  v stands forrx v  v . therefore, as pointed out in [100], one would expect the

su(n) partition function to be invariant to 0  0 + 1, while the su(n)/zzn theory
should be only invariant under 0  0 + 2n on arbitrary four-manifolds, and under
0  0 + n on spin four-manifolds (where v  v is even.) in any case, for odd n, we have
invariance under 0  0 + n on any four-manifold.
as we have argued above, one can compute the partition function in terms of the
vacuum degrees of freedom of the n = 1 theory which results from giving bare masses to
all the three chiral multiplets of the n = 4 theory. the partition functions on k3 for gauge
group su(n) and trivial t hooft uxes have been computed by vafa and collaborators
in [82]. we will extend their results to arbitrary t hooft uxes and compute the partition
function on more general kahler four-manifolds. these results have been presented in
[60][61].

72

the vafa-witten theory

5.5.1 the partition function on k3

as a rst step towards the derivation of the formula for the partition function we will
consider the theory on k3, where some explicit results are already available. for x a
k3 surface the canonical divisor is trivial, so there exists a nowhere vanishing section of
the bundle of (2, 0) forms. therefore, the mass perturbation  does not vanish anywhere
and the above analysis of the vacuum structure of the n =1 theory carries over without
change.
the structure of the partition function for trivial t hooft ux was conjectured in
[100]. this conjecture has been conrmed in [82] by studying the eective theory on n
coincident m5-branes wrapping around k3 t 2. the partition function for zero t hooft
ux is almost a hecke transformation of order n [3] of g( ) = ( )24, with ( ) the
dedekind function  see eq. (3.7) in [82]:

ad=n, b<d

d (cid:19) .

notice that the number of terms in (5.101) equals the sum of the positive divisors of n
as we mentioned above. when n is prime the formula is considerably simpler

there are n + 1 terms, the rst one corresponding to the irreducible embedding, and the
other n to the vacua of the n =1 su(n) sym theory.

the su(n) partition function is dened from (5.101) as zsu (n ) = 1

n zv=0. from it,

notice the rst equality in (5.103), which is, up to some correction factors which vanish
in at space, the original montonen-olive conjecture.

(5.103)

to generalize (5.102) for gauge congurations with arbitrary t hooft ux we pro-
ceed as in [100]. the n contributions coming from the n = 1 pure gauge theory
vacua are related by an anomalous chiral symmetry which takes 0  0 + 1. the

lous phases eimkv = ei n 1

the above results only hold for prime n. we have not been able to nd the appropriate
generalization for arbitrary n.

5.5.2 more general kahler manifolds

on more general kahler manifolds the spatially dependent mass term vanishes where
 does, and we will assume as in [100][109] that  vanishes with multiplicity one on a
union of disjoint, smooth complex curves cj, j = 1, . . . n of genus gj which represent
the canonical divisor k of x. the vanishing of  introduces corrections involving k
and additional modular functions whose precise form is not known a priori. in the g =
su(2) case, each of the n = 1 vacua bifurcates along each of the components cj of the
canonical divisor into two strongly coupled massive vacua. this vacuum degeneracy is
believed to stem [100][109] from the spontaneous breaking of a zz2 chiral symmetry which
is unbroken in bulk. this is exactly the same pattern that arises in all known examples
of twisted n = 2 theories with gauge group su(2) as the donaldson-witten theory
and its generalizations [64][84][109]. this in turn seems to be related to the possibility
of rewritting the corrections near the canonical divisor in terms of the seiberg-witten
invariants [110].
in fact, it is known that the vafa-witten partition function for g =
su(2) can be rewritten in terms of the seiberg-witten invariants [26].

2note that k3 has  = 24,  = 16, b1 = 0 and b2 = 22.

74

the vafa-witten theory

the form of the corrections for g = su(n) is more involved. from related results
on donaldson-witten theory [76] we know that the higher-rank case presents some new
features. we have not been able to disentangle the structure of the vacua near the
canonical divisor from rst principles. instead, we will exploit the expected behaviour of
the partition function under blow-ups of x. this, together with the modular invariance
of the partition function will suce to completely determine the unknown functions.

5.5.2.1 behaviour under blow-ups

dimensional lattice spanned by the poincare dual of the exceptional divisor b created by

blowing up a point on a kahler manifold x replaces it with a new kahler manifold bx
whose second cohomology lattice is h 2(bx, zz) = h 2(x, zz)  i, where i is the one-
the blow-up. any allowed zzn uxbv on bx is of the formbv = v  r, where v is a ux in x
as above, the partition functions for xed t hooft uxes bzbx,bv factorize as zx,v times a

and r = b,  = 0, 1, . . . n  1. the main result concerning the su(2) partition function
in [100] is that under blowing up a point on a kahler four-manifold with canonical divisor

level 1 character of the su(2) wzw model. it would be natural to expect that the same
factorization holds for g = su(n), but now with the level 1 su(n) characters. in fact,
the same behaviour under blow-ups has been proved by yoshioka [115] for the generating
function of euler characteristics of su(n) instanton moduli space on kahler manifolds.
this should not come out as a surprise since it is known that, on certain four-manifolds,
the partition function of vafa-witten theory computes euler characteristics of instanton
moduli spaces [82][100]. this can be conrmed by realizing the vafa-witten theory as
the low-energy theory of m5-branes wrapped on x  t 2 [24]. it seems therefore natural
to assume that the same factorization holds for the partition function with g = su(n).

explicitly, given a t hooft ux bv = v  b,  = 0, 1, . . . n  1, on bx, we assume the

factorization [115]

zbx,bv(0) = zx,v(0)

(0)
(0)

,

(5.107)

where (0) is the appropriate level 1 character of su(n)  see the appendix to this
chapter for details. this assumption xes almost completely the form of the partition
functions. some loose ends can be tied up by demanding modular invariance of the
resulting expression.

5.5.3 the formula for the partition function

given the assumptions above, and taking into account the structure of the partition
function on k3, we are in a position to write down the formula for kahler four-folds x
with h(2,0) 6= 0. we will rst assume that the canonical divisor k is connected and with
genus g  1 = 2 + 3. the formula is then

(5.109)

the structure of the corrections near the canonical divisor in (5.108) suggests that the
mechanism at work in this case is not chiral symmetry breaking. indeed, near k there is
an n-fold bifurcation of the vacuum, and the functions , m, (with m xed) are not
related by a shift in 0 as it would be the case were chiral symmetry breaking responsible
for the bifurcation. a plausible explanation for this bifurcation could be found in the
spontaneous breaking of the center of the gauge group (which for g = su(n) is precisely
zzn .) this could come about as follows. let us focus on the irreducible embedding.
for trivial canonical divisor the gauge group is almost but not completely higgsed in
this vacuum.
in fact, since the scalar elds transform in the adjoint representation of
su(n), the center zzn  su(n) remains unbroken. the su(n) gauge threory has zzn
string-like solitons [44] which carry non-trivial zzn -valued electric and magnetic quantum
numbers. if these solitons condense, the center zzn is completely broken giving rise to
an n-fold degeneracy of the vacuum. each vacuum is singled out by a dierent value
of the zzn -valued ux. now for non-trivial canonical divisor k as above, the irreducible
vacuum separates into n vacua with magnetic uxes [k]n ! one could be tempted to
speculate further and identify the surface k (or the cj below) with the world-sheet of the
condensed string soliton.

as in [100] we can generalize the above formula for the case that the canonical divisor
consists of n disjoint smooth components cj, j = 1, . . . , n of genus gj on which  vanishes
with multiplicity one. the resulting expression very similar to that in [100]

where j = 0, 1, . . . n  1 are chosen independently. notice that (5.110) reduces to
the formulas for the partition function do not apply directly to the n = 2 case. for
n = 2 there are some extra relative phases ti  see equations (5.45) and (5.46) in [100] 
which are absent for n > 2 and prime. modulo these extra phases, (5.108) and (5.110) are
a direct generalization of vafa and wittens results. they reduce on k3 to the formula
of minahan, nemeschansky, vafa and warner [82] and generalize their results to non-zero
t hooft ux. moreover, as we will show momentarily, they transform as expected under
duality and factorize appropriately under blow-ups. therefore, the above results (5.108)
and (5.110) can be seen as predictions for the euler numbers of instanton moduli spaces
on kahler four-manifolds with b+

2 > 1.

it could be interesting to investigate whether (5.108) and (5.110) can be rewritten in
terms of the seiberg-witten invariants. we believe that this is not the case for the follow-
ing reason. let us suppose that it is actually possible to do so. then one would expect,
by analogy with the result for su(2) [26], that the donaldson-witten partition function
for su(n) [76] should be recovered from the vafa-witten su(n) partition function in
the decoupling limit q0  0, m   with m4q0 xed. in particular, one would expect
that the structure of the corrections involving the canonical divisor should be preserved
in this limit. now in the dw partition function in [76], these corrections are written in
terms of the seiberg-witten classes x [110]. for g = su(n) these basic classes appear
nx1    nxn 1 (nxl are the seiberg-witten invariants [110]).
therefore, for g = su(n) there are n  1 independent basic classes contributing to the
above sum. on a kahler manifold with canonical divisor k = c1  c2      cn, with
the cj disjoint and with multiplicity one, each of these basic classes can be written as

in the generic formpx1,...xn 1

xl =xj

l

j
l cj,

(5.112)

with each j
l = 1 [110], and the sum over the basic classes can be traded for a sum
over the j
l . this is analogous to the sum over the j in (5.110), and both sums should
contain the same number of terms were it possible to rewrite (5.110) in terms of the basic
classes. however, while in the sum over the j
l there are 2n(n1) terms, the sum over the
j contains n n terms. notice that this two numbers do coincide when n = 2, as it should
be, but for n 6= 2 this is no longer the case.
it would certainly be mostly interesting to extend these results to all n (not necessarily
prime), and to investigate what the large n limit of (5.108) and (5.110) correspond to on
the gravity side in the light of the ads/cft correspondence. this remains as an open
problem.

thus, the partition function (5.110) takes the form

given (5.110), we can see explicitly how the factorization property (5.107) works. let x

which is the montonen-olive relation. notice that since n is odd, the su(n) (or
su(n)/zzn ) partition function is modular (up to a phase) for 0(n) on any four-manifold.
on the other hand, for even n one would expect on general grounds [100] modularity for
0(2n), or at most 0(n) on spin manifolds.

3we assume as in [100] that there is no torsion in h2(x, zz). were this not case, eqs. (5.119) and

(5.110) above should be modied along the lines explained in [113].

(5.121)

notice that since t 4 is a spin manifold, v2  2zz, and therefore the sum over m in (5.120)

zt 4,v = v,0 +

(5.122)

which gives the partition function for the physical n = 4 su(n) theory in the sector of
t hooft ux v and in the limit 0   (which would explain the discrepancy with the
results in [33].)

chapter 6

adjoint non-abelian monopoles

in this chapter we will study the second possible twist of the n = 4 theory. the twisted
theory is well-dened on spin four-manifolds, and can be deformed by giving masses to two
of the chiral multiplets. the massive theory is still topological on arbitrary spin manifolds
and is in fact the twisted counterpart of the mass deformed n = 4 theory. using the
low-energy eective description of the physical theory we compute, within the u-plane
approach of moore and witten [84], the generating function of topological correlation
functions for gauge group su(2) and arbitrary values of the t hooft uxes, and analyze
the duality properties of the resulting formulas.

6.1 the twisted theory

the theory is dened by the splitting 4  (2, 1)  (1, 1)  (1, 1) of the fundamental
representation of su(4)i in representations of su(2)l  su(2)r. as explained in [114],
this amounts to breaking su(4)i down to a subgroup su(2)a  su(2)f  u(1), and then
replacing su(2)l with the diagonal sum su(2)l of su(2)l and su(2)a. the subgroup
su(2)f  u(1) remains in the theory as an internal symmetry group. hence, we observe
that, as a by-product of the twisting procedure, it remains in the theory a u(1) symmetry
which was not present in the original n = 4 theory, and which becomes, as we shall see in
a moment, the ghost number symmetry associated to the topological theory. with respect
to the new symmetry group h = su(2)l  su(2)r  su(2)f  u(1) the supercharges
qv
, where the index i labels the
representation 2 of su(2)f . in more detail,

 split up into three supercharges q(), q and qi

 (q = q

  qv=2
),

 ,

83

the conjugate supercharges qv  split up accordingly into a vector isosinglet and a right-
handed spinor isodoublet supercharge, q  and qi .

84

adjoint non-abelian monopoles

the elds of the n = 4 multiplet give rise, after the twisting, to the following topo-

logical multiplet (in the notation of reference [114]):

a   a(0)
  ,
 , (1), (+1)
v  (1)
i ,
v
  ,  (1)
  (+1)
i  ,
uv  b(2), c (+2), g(0)
i ,

(6.2)

where we have indicated the ghost number carried by the elds after the twisting by a
superscript. notice that the twisted theory contains several spinor elds. this means that
the theory is not well dened on those manifolds x that do not admit a spin structure.
as explained in [48][63][66]  see [110] for a related discussion , one could try to avoid
this problem by coupling the spinor elds to a xed (background) spinc structure. this is
essentially a xed abelian gauge conguration with magnetic uxes through the two-cycles
of x quantized in zz/2 instead of in zz, which would be the standard dirac quantization
condition. quantum mechanics of electric charges is not consistent in this background,
but it turns out that the obstruction to dening consistent quantum propagation can be
xed to cancel the obstruction to dening spinors on x [43]. we will not follow this path
here, and therefore we will take x to be an  otherwise arbitrary  spin four-manifold.

some of the denitions in (6.2) need clarication. our choices for the anticommuting

elds are:

(v=1,2)   ( = (),

 = 2[],

v =
 =(v=1,2

v=3,4

v

(v=3,4)  i,
  
,
   i
,

whereas for the commuting ones we set:

b = 12,
g(i=1)1 = 13,
g(i=1)2 = 23,

c = 34,
g(i=2)1 = 14,
g(i=2)2 = 24.

to obtain the corresponding topological symmetry we proceed as follows. first of
all, we recall that the n = 4 supersymmetry transformations (3.3) are generated by

. according to our conventions, to obtain the q-transformations we
qv
v
must set v

 qv
 = 0 and make the replacement:

v =((v=1,2)  c,

(v=3,4)  0.

the resulting transformations turn out to be:

(6.7)

the generator q of the transformations (6.7) satises the on-shell algebra {q, q} =
g(c) where by g(c) we mean a non-abelian gauge transformation generated by c. it is
possible to realize this algebra o-shell, i.e., without the input of the equations of motion
for some of the elds in the theory. a minimal o-shell formulation can be constructed
by introducing in the theory the auxiliary elds n (symmetric in its spinor indices) and
p i
, both with ghost number 0. the o-shell brst transformations which correspond to

[q, n] = 22i [, c],

(6.11)

eqs. (6.8) and (6.11) summarize what we could say was the standard formulation
of the second twist as discussed by yamron [114]. however, we think there are several
subtleties that demand clarication. since the twisted theory contains several spinor elds
taking values in the fundamental representation of the internal su(2)f symmetry group,
and these elds are necessarily complex, as they live in complex representations of the
rotation group and of the isospin group, it can be seen that the action (6.11) is not real.
moreover, there are more elds in the twisted theory than in the physical theory. to see
this, pick for example the scalar elds uv in the physical n = 4 theory. they are 6
real elds that after the twisting become the scalar elds b and c (which can be safely
taken to be real, thus making a total of 2 real elds) and the isospin doublet bosonic
spinor eld gi, which is necessarily complex and thus is built out of 2  2  2 = 8 real
elds. thus we see that 6 real elds in the n = 4 theory give rise to 10 real elds in the
twisted theory. with the anticommuting elds this overcounting is even worse. in what
follows we will break su(2)f explicitly and rearrange the resulting elds wisely so as to
avoid these problems. the outcome of this reformulation is that we will make contact
with the non-abelian monopole theory formulated in [63][64][65] (see [74] for a review).
as an aside we would like to comment on the reality conditions we have been forced to
impose in this and the previous twist. it is well known that a similar problem arises in
donaldson-witten theory. we are aware that it would be desirable to have at our disposal
a systematic way of handling these issues. however, at present there is no such unied
scheme  but see [15] for a concrete proposal in this direction. the best way to proceed in
our opinion, is to consider the theory from the viewpoint of the mathai-quillen approach
(whenever this is possible), where the geometrical content of the theory as well as the role
played by each eld are explicit.

we start with the elds gi, which we rearrange in a complex commuting two-

88

. the constraint
 = (g2) looks rather natural when considered from the viewpoint of the physical

component weyl spinor m  g2 and its complex conjugate m

similarly, for the other isodoublets in the theory we make the rearrangements:

1 = ,
2 = ,
p1  = h ,

1  =  ,
2 =  ,
p2  = h .

finally, after redening   i, c  , b   and n  h (a and  remain the

(6.19)

the resulting theory is equivalent to the theory of non-abelian monopoles discussed in
[1][48][63][64][65][74], but with the monopole multiplet in the adjoint representation of the
gauge group. that theory in turn is a generalization of the abelian monopole equations
proposed in [110].

6.1.1 the massive theory

let us now deform the n = 4 theory by turning on equal bare masses for two of the chiral
multiplets. the mass terms break preserve two supersymmetries and break the su(4)i
symmetry group down to su(2)i  u(1)b. of the four gauginos of the n = 4 theory,
two remain massles and transform as a doublet under su(2)i and carry no u(1)b charge,
while the other two get a mass and transform as a singlet under su(2)i and are charged
under u(1)b, which is in fact the baryon number symmetry of the n = 2 theory. if we

90

adjoint non-abelian monopoles

now twist su(2)i with su(2)l, say, the resulting theory is a non-abelian monopole theory
with massive monopoles in the adjoint representation of the gauge group. this theory has
a well-dened scalar supersymmetry and is therefore topological for any value of the mass
on any spin four-manifold. this was shown for the n = 2 supersymmetric theory with
one hypermultiplet in the fundamental representation in [1], and it is straightforward
to extend this result to the present situation.
in fact, it was shown in [65] (again for
the n = 2, nf = 1 theory), that the twisted theory is the equivariant extension of the
massless theory with respect to the u(1)b symmetry. notice that from the viewpoint of
the twisting, the u(1)b is the cartan subgroup of su(2)f .

6.2 the mathai-quillen approach

as we saw before, the model arising from the second twist is equivalent to the theory
of non-abelian monopoles with the monopole elds in the adjoint representation of the
gauge group. the relevant basic equations for this model involve the self-dual part of the
gauge connection f + and a certain complex spinor eld m taking values in the adjoint
representation of some compact nite dimensional lie group g:

(f +

 + [m (, m)] = 0,
d m  = 0,

(6.20)

where m is the complex conjugate of m.

6.2.1 the topological framework

the geometrical setting is a certain oriented, closed riemannian four-manifold x, that
we will also assume to be spin. we will denote the positive and negative chirality spin
bundles by s+ and s respectively. the eld space is m = a(x, s+adp ), where a
is the space of connections on a principal g-bundle p  x, and the second factor denotes
the space of sections of the product bundle s+  adp , that is, positive chirality spinors
taking values in the lie algebra of the gauge group. the group g of gauge transformations
of the bundle p has an action on the eld space which is given locally by:

g(a) = i(dg)g1 + gag1,
g(m) = gmg1,

(6.21)
where m  (x, s+  adp ) and a is the gauge connection. in terms of the covariant
], the innitesimal form of the transformations (6.21), with
derivative da = d + i[a,
g = exp(i) and   0(x, adp ), takes the form:
g()a = da,
g()m = i[m, ].

(6.22)

duality in topological quantum field theories

91

the tangent space to the eld space at the point (a, m) is the vector space t(a,m )m =
1(x, adp ) (x, s+  adp ). on t(a,m )m we can dene a gauge-invariant riemannian
metric given by:

the basic equations (6.20) are introduced in this framework as sections of the trivial
vector bundle v = m  f , where the bre is in this case f = 2,+(x, adp ) (x, s 
adp ). taking into account the form of the basic equations, the section reads, up to some
harmless normalization factors that we introduce for reasons that will become apparent

 + [m (, m)]), 2d m (cid:1).

(6.24)

the section (6.24) can be alternatively seen as a gauge ad-equivariant map from the
principal g-bundle m  m/g to the vector space f , and in this way it descends naturally
to a section s of the associated vector bundle mgf , whose zero locus gives precisely the
moduli space of the topological theory. it would be desirable to compute the dimension
of this moduli space. the relevant deformation complex (which allows one to compute,
in a general situation, the virtual dimension of the moduli space) is the following:

0 0(x, adp ) c1(x, adp )  (x, s+  adp )

ds2,+(x, adp )  (x, s  adp ).

the map c : 0(x, adp )  tm is given by:

c() = (da, i[m, ]),   0(x, adp ),

(6.25)

(6.26)

while the map ds : t(a,m )m  f is provided by the linearization of the basic equations
(6.20):

ds(, ) =(cid:0)4

 d  2[(, m)]  2[m (, )],

2d  + 2[ , m ](cid:1).

(6.27)

under suitable conditions, the index of the complex (6.25) computes de dimension of
ker(ds)/im(c). to calculate the index, the complex (6.25) can be split up into the asd-
instanton deformation complex:

(1) 0  0(x, adp ) da1(x, adp )

p+da2,+(x, adp )  0,

(6.28)

92

adjoint non-abelian monopoles

whose index is p1(adp ) + dim(g)( + )/2, being p1(adp ) the rst pontryagin class of
the adjoint bundle adp , and the complex associated to the twisted dirac operator

(2) d : (x, s+  adp )  (x, s  adp ),

(6.29)

whose index is p1(adp )/2dim(g)/8. thus, the index of the total complex (which gives
minus the virtual dimension of the moduli space) is:

dim(m) = ind(1)  2  ind(2) = dim(g)

of two appears in (6.30) since we want to compute the real dimension of the moduli space.

6.2.2 the topological action

we now proceed as in the previous case. to build a topological theory out of the moduli
problem dened by the equations (6.20) we need the following multiplet of elds. for
the eld space m = a  (x, s+  adp ) we introduce commuting elds (a, m), both
with ghost number 0, and their corresponding superpartners, the anticommuting elds 
and , both with ghost number 1. for the bre f = 2,+(x, adp )  (x, s  adp )
we introduce anticommuting elds + and  respectively, both with ghost number 1,
and their superpartners, a commuting self-dual two-form h + and a commuting negative
chirality spinor h, both with ghost number 0 and which appear as auxiliary elds in
the associated eld theory. and nally, associated to the gauge symmetry, we have
a commuting scalar eld   0(x, adp ) with ghost number +2, and a multiplet of
scalar elds  (commuting and with ghost number 2) and  (anticommuting and with
ghost number 1), both also in 0(x, adp ) and which enforce the horizontal projection
m  m/g. the brst symmetry of the model is given by:

[q, a] = ,
[q, m] = ,

[q, ] = 0,
{q, +
} = h +
,
{q,  } = h ,
[q, ] = ,

{q, } = d,
{q,  } = i [m, ],

[q, h +

] = i [+

[q, h ] = i [ , ],
{q,  } = i [, ].

(6.31)

this brst algebra closes up to a gauge transformation generated by .

we have to give now the expressions for the dierent pieces of the gauge fermion. for

6.3 the observables for g = su (2)

let us now focus on the twisted theory for gauge group su(2). as discussed above, the
twisted n = 4 action breaks up into a q-exact piece plus a topological term proportional
to the instanton number of the gauge conguration,

stwisted = {q, }  2ik0,

(6.36)

with k = 2/4 mod zz the instanton number of the gauge conguration with t hooft
ux   h 2(x, zz2) (in this chapter we change our notation to make contact with the
results in [59]; thus,  will denote an so(3) t hooft ux). this is an integer for su(2)
bundles (which have  = 0), but a half-integer for non-trivial so(3) bundles on spin
four-manifolds. therefore, as pointed out in [100], one would expect the su(2) theory
to be invariant under 0  0 + 1, while the so(3) theory should be only invariant
under 0  0 + 2 on spin manifolds. notice that, owing to (6.36), the partition function
depends on the microscopic couplings e0 and 0 only through the combination 2ik0,
and in particular this dependence is a priori holomorphic (as usual, if we reversed the
orientation of the manifold x, the partition function would depend anti-holomorphically
on 0).

in the twisting procedure, one couples the twisted action (6.36) to arbitrary gravita-
tional backgrounds, so as to deal with its formulation for a wide variety of manifolds. in
general, the procedure involves the covariantization of the at-space action, as well as the
addition of curvature terms to render the new action as a q-exact piece plus a topological
term as in (6.36). actually, on curved space one might think of additional topological

terms  such as r r  r or r r  r, with r the curvature two-form of the manifold

 besides the one already present in (6.36). thus, the action which comes out of the
twisting procedure is not unique (even modulo q-exact terms), since it is always possible
to add c-number terms, which vanish on at space but are nevertheless topological. in
a topological eld theory in four dimensions, those terms are proportional to the euler
number  and the signature  of the manifold x. in order to keep the holomorphicity
in 0, the proportionality constants must be functions of 0. at this stage one does not
know which particular functions to take, but clearly good transformation properties under
duality could be spoiled if one does not make the right choice. it seems therefore that
there exists a preferred choice of those terms, which is compatible with duality. this issue
was treated in detail in [100], where it was shown that a c-number of the form i0/6
was needed in the topological action in order to have a theory with good transformation
properties under duality. in the case at hand, this c-number has the form i0( + )/2
if 2 + 3 = 0 mod 32, and i0(2 + 3)/8 otherwise. this will be shown in subsection
6.4.4 below.

topological invariants are obtained by considering the vacuum expectation value of
arbitrary products of observables, which are operators that are q-invariant but not q-
exact. as discussed in [56][64], the relevant observables for this theory and gauge group

95

su(2) or so(3), are precisely the same as in the donaldson-witten theory [104]:

w0 =

w2 =

w1 =

w3 =

(6.37)

the operators wi have positive ghost numbers given by 4  i and satisfy the descent
equations

which imply that

[q, wi} = dwi1,

o(j ) =zj

wj,

(6.38)

(6.39)

j being homology cycles of x, are observables.

the vacuum expectation value of an arbitrary product of observables has the general
form (modulo a term which involves the exponential of a linear combination of  and ),

*yj

o(j )+ =xk *yj

o(j )+

k

e2ik0,

(6.40)

where k is the instanton number and hqj o(j )ik is the vacuum expectation value com-

puted at a xed value of k. these quantities are independent of the coupling constant e0.
when analysed in the weak coupling limit, the contributions to the functional integral
come from eld congurations which are solutions to eqs. (6.20). all the dependence of
the observables on 0 is contained in the phases exp(2ik0) in (6.40). the question
therefore arises as to whether the vacuum expectation values of these observables have
good modular properties under sl(2, zz) transformations acting on 0. below it will be
shown that this is indeed the case, at least for spin four-manifolds of simple type (al-
though one could easily extend the arguments presented here to all simply-connected spin
manifolds with b+

2 > 1).

the ghost-number anomaly of the theory restricts the possible non-trivial topologi-
cal invariants to be those for which the overall ghost number of the operator insertions
matches the anomaly (3/4)(2 + 3). notice that since any arbitrary product of ob-
servables has necessarily positive ghost number, there will be no non-trivial topological
invariant for those manifolds for which 2 + 3 is strictly positive. on the other hand, if
2 + 3 < 0, there is only a nite number  if any  of non-trivial topological invariants.
finally, when 2 + 3 = 0, as is the case for k3, for example, the only non-trivial topo-
logical invariant is the partition function. moreover, as the physical and twisted theories
are actually the same on hyper-kahler manifolds as k3, this partition function should

96

adjoint non-abelian monopoles

coincide with the one computed by vafa and witten for another twist of the n = 4
supersymmetric theory in [100]. below we will show that this is indeed the case. notice
that this assertion does not apply to the twist rst considered by marcus, as it actually
involves two independent twists, one on each of the su(2) factors of the holonomy group
of the manifold [56][114]. the selection rule on the topological invariants that we have
just discussed does not apply of course to the massive theory, as the mass terms explicitly
break the ghost number symmetry. however, when the mass is turned on the partition
function remaims invariant (one would expect on general grounds a dependence of the
form z  ms, where s is some number, but since the partition function is dimensionless,
and there is no other dimensionful parameter in the theory, the only possibility is s = 0),
but the observables do get an explicit dependence on m which can be xed on dimensional
grounds. indeed, the operators w0 and w2 in (6.37), which will be the only ones that
we will consider, have mass dimensions 2 and 1 respectively (notice that these coincide
with half the ghost number of each operator), so for a vev ho(1)   o(r)i involving these
operators we expect a mass dependence of the form

ho(1)   o(r)i  mp r

n=1 gn/2.

(6.41)

6.4 integrating over the u-plane

the functional-integral (or microscopic) approach to twisted supersymmetric quantum
eld theories gives great insight into their geometric structure, but it is not useful to
make explicit calculations. once the relevant set of eld congurations (moduli space)
on which the functional-integral is supported has been identied, the computation of the
partition function or, more generally, of the topological correlation functions, is reduced
to a nite-dimensional integration over the quantum uctuations (zero modes) tangent
to the moduli space. for this to produce sensible topological information, it is necessary
to give a suitable prescription for the integration, and a convenient compactication of
the moduli space is usually needed as well. this requires an extra input of information
which, in most of the cases is at the heart of the subtle topological information expected
to capture with the invariants themselves.

the strategy to circumvent these problems and extract concrete predictions rests in
taking advantage of the crucial fact that, by construction, the generating functional for
topological correlation functions in a topological quantum eld theory is independent
of the metric on the manifold, at least for b+
2 > 1. this implies that, in principle,
these correlation functions can be computed in either the ultraviolet (short-distance) or
infrared (long-distance) limits. the naive functional-integral approach focuses on the
short-distance regime, while long-distance computations require a precise knowledge of
the vacuum structure and low-energy dynamics of the physical theory.

following this line of reasoning, it was proposed by witten in [110] that the explicit
solution for the low-energy eective descriptions for a family of four-dimensional n = 2
supersymmetric eld theories presented in [92][93] could be used to perform an alternative

duality in topological quantum field theories

97

long-distance computation of the topological correlators which relies completely on the
properties of the physical theory. this idea is at the heart of the successful reformulation
of the donaldson invariants, for a certain subset of four-manifolds, in terms of the by now
well-known seiberg-witten invariants, which are essentially the partition functions of the
twisted eective abelian theories at the singular points on the moduli space of vacua
of the physical, n = 2 supersymmetric theories. the same idea has been subsequently
applied to some other theories [52][64][70][75][84], thereby providing a whole set of pre-
dictions which should be tested against explicit mathematical results. the moral of these
computations is that the duality structure of extended supersymmetric theories automat-
ically incorporates, in an as yet not fully understood way, a consistent compactication
scheme for the moduli space of their twisted counterparts.

the standard computation of this sort involves an integration over the moduli space
of vacua (the u-plane) of the physical theory. the reason why one has to integrate over all
the vacua of the physical theory rather than just consider the contribution from a given
vacuum has to do with the compacteness of the spacetime manifold [23]. indeed, on a
non-compact manifold the constant values 0 of the scalar elds which dene the vacuum
state of the theory are not normalizable, so one does not integrate over them in the
path integral. but if we consider the same theory on a compact manifold, these constant
modes become normalizable (that is, they are true zero modes) and one has to integrate
over them in the path integral. alternatively, on a compact manifold there is tunneling
between dierent vacua, so there is really no point in considering the contribution from a
single vacuum. we thus have to consider the theory for all vacua. at a generic vacuum,
the only contribution comes from a twisted n = 2 abelian vector multiplet. the eect
of the massive modes is contained in appropriate measure factors, which also incorporate
the coupling to gravity  these measure factors were derived in [111] by demanding that
they reproduce the gravitational anomalies of the massive elds , and in contact terms
among the observables  the contact term for the two-observable for the su(2) theory
was derived in [84] and was subsequently extended to more general observables and other
gauge groups in [70][75][76].

the total contribution to the generating function thus consists of an integration over
the moduli space with the singularities removed  which is non-vanishing for b+
2 (x) = 1
[84] only  plus a discrete sum over the contributions of the twisted eective theories
at each of the singularities. the eective theory at a given singularity should contain,
together with the appropriate dual photon multiplet, several charged hypermultiplets,
which correspond to the states becoming massless at the singularity. the complete eec-
tive action for these massless states contains as well certain measure factors and contact
terms among the observables, which reproduce the eect of the massive states which have
been integrated out. however, it is not possible to x these a priori unknown functions by
anomaly considerations only. as rst proposed in [84]  see [75][76][77] for more details
and further extensions , the alternative strategy takes advantage of the wall-crossing
properties of the u-plane integral. it is a well-known fact that donaldson theory fails to
produce topological invariants on four-manifolds with b+
2 = 1. the eld theory explana-

98

adjoint non-abelian monopoles

tion of this failure is as follows. on manifolds x with b+
2 = 1 the donaldson invariants are
given by the sum of the contributions from the singularities at u = 2 of the n = 2 sym
theory plus the u-plane integral. consider a one-parameter family of metrics g = eg,
where g is a reference metric on x, and let  be the corresponding period point (which
gives a basis for h 2,+(x)) normalized as 2
 = 1. it was shown in [84] that at those points
on the u-plane where the (imaginary part of the) eective coupling diverges, the integral
has a discontinuous variation at those values of  where, for a xed gauge conguration
  h 2(x; zz), the period    changes sign. this is commonly referred to as wall
crossing (with  dening a wall on the kahler cone.) this discontinuous variation of
the integral as we change  is precisely the proper physical explanation of the lack of
topological invariance of the correlation functions of the twisted theories on manifolds
with b+
2 = 1. the points where wall crossing can take place are the singularities of the
moduli space due to charged matter multiplets becoming massless  the appropriate local
eective coupling  diverges there  and, in the case of the asymptotically free theories,
the point at innity, u  , where also the eective electric coupling diverges owing to
asymptotic freedom.
on the other hand, the nal expression for the invariants can exhibit a wall-crossing
behaviour at most at u  , so the contribution to wall crossing from the integral at
the singularities at nite values of u must cancel against the contributions coming from
the eective theories there, which also display wall-crossing discontinuities. as shown in
[84], this cancellation xes almost completely the unknown functions in the contributions
to the topological correlation functions from the singularities.

6.4.1 the integral for n = 4 supersymmetry
the complete expression for the u-plane integral for the gauge group su(2) and nf  4
was worked out in [84]. the appropriate general formulas for the contact terms can be
found in [70][75][76]. these formulas follow the conventions in [93], according to which,
for nf = 0, the u-plane is the modular curve of 0(4). in this formalism, the monodromy
associated to a single matter multiplet becoming massless is conjugated to t . as for
the n = 4 supersymmetric theory, it is more convenient to use instead a formalism
related to (2), in which the basic monodromies are conjugated to t 2. our formulas
follow straightforwardly from those in [75][84], with some minor changes to conform to
our conventions.

the integral in the n = 4 supersymmetric case, for gauge groups su(2) or so(3)
and on simply-connected four-manifolds, and for t hooft ux , is given by the formula:

where (sasb) is the intersection number of sa and sb. notice that since we are restricting
ourselves to simply-connected four-manifolds, there is no non-trivial contribution from the
one- and three-observables w1 and w3 in (6.39). the generalization to the non-simply-
connected case was outlined in [84], and it has been recently put on a more rigorous basis

2 w2(e). as explained in
detail in [111], this shift takes into account the fact that in the so(3) theory, while the
rank-3 so(3) bundle e (which at a generic vacuum is broken down to e = (l l1)2 =
l2  o  l2, o being a trivial bundle) is always globally dened  and therefore l2 is
represented by an integral class c1(l2) = 2  2h 2(x, zz) + w2(e) , it is not necessarily
true that the corresponding su(2) bundle f (which we can somewhat loosely represent
at low energies by f = l  l1) exists, the obstruction being precisely w2(e): the line
bundle l is represented by a class c1(l) =   h 2(x, zz) + 1
2w2(e), which is not integral
unless w2(e) = 0 (mod 2). if w2(e) = 0 mod 2, the so(3) bundle can be lifted to an
su(2) bundle and one has f  f = e  o, where now f is a globally dened rank-2
su(2) bundle.

here  denotes the intersection pairing on x,    =rx    . thanks to its properties,

 acts as a projector onto the self-dual and antiself-dual subspaces of the two-dimensional
cohomology of x: + = (  ),  =   +.
from the above formulas it can be readily checked, along the lines explained in detail
in [75][76][84], that the integral (6.42) is well dened and, in particular, is invariant under
the monodromy group of the low-energy theory (for example, this can be seen almost
immediately for the semiclassical monodromy, which at large z  u takes z  e2iz and
a  a, ad  ad, while leaving   0 unchanged.

6.4.2 wall crossing at the singular points

at each of the three singularities, the corresponding local eective coupling diverges:
yj = im j  +, qj  0. the rst step to analyse the behaviour of the integral around
the singular points is to make a duality transformation (in  ) to rewrite the integrand
in terms of the appropriate variables:   1/ near the monopole point, etc. due
to the divergence of im j, one nds a discontinuity in zu when    changes sign. we
begin by considering the behaviour near the semiclassical singularity at z1. as the bps
state responsible for the singularity is electrically charged, it is not necessary to perform a
duality transformation in this case: the theory is weakly coupled in terms of the original
eective coupling  . let us consider the integral (6.42). fix  and dene (q) as follows:

(q)(cid:3)q0 = res q=0(cid:2)q21(q)(cid:3).

we have now to evaluate the wall-crossing discontinuities at the other two singularities.
at the monopole point (z = z2), we have to perform a duality transformation to express
the integral in terms of d = 1/ , which is the appropriate variable there. this duality
transformation involves a poisson resummation in (6.50), which exchanges the electric
class   h 2(x, zz) + 1
2w2(e) with the magnetic class   h 2(x, zz)1, and inverts the
coupling constant  . the details are not terribly important, so we just give the nal result

the corresponding expression at the dyon point z3, is exactly the same as (6.58) (with
qd instead of qd) but with an extra relative phase i2 [84][109][110], which follows from
doing the duality transformation   d = 1/(  1) in the lattice sum (6.50).

6.4.3 contributions from the singularities

at each of the singularities, the complete eective theory contains a dual abelian vector
multiplet2 (weakly) coupled to a massless charged hypermultiplet representing the bps
conguration responsible for the singularity. this eective theory can be twisted in the
standard way, and the resulting topological theory is the celebrated wittens abelian
monopole theory. its moduli space is dened by the abelianized version of eqs. (6.20).
on spin four-manifolds, and for a given gauge conguration   h 2(x, zz), the virtual
dimension of the moduli space can be seen to be

dim = 

(2 + 3)

4

+ ()2.

(6.59)

a class  for which dim = 0 is called a basic class. if we dene x = 2, we see from
(6.59) that for a basic class x  x = 2 + 3. as dimx = 0, the moduli space consists
(generically) of a (nite) collection of isolated points. the partition function of the theory
evaluated at each basic class gives the seiberg-witten invariant nx. the complete partition

function will therefore be a (nite) sum over the dierent basic classes: zsingularity px nx.

if, on the other hand, the dimension of the moduli space of abelian monopoles is strictly
positive, one has to insert observables to obtain a non-trivial result. this leads to the
denition of the generalized seiberg-witten invariants [84][96]: if dim = 2n (otherwise
the invariant is automatically set to zero),

swn() =d( )ne

,

(6.60)

where  is the (twisted) scalar eld in the abelian n = 2 vector multiplet. for a four-
manifold x with b+
2 > 1, the u-plane integral vanishes and the only contributions to
the topological correlation functions come from the eective theories at the singularities.
those manifolds with b+
2 > 1 for which the only non-trivial contributions come from the
zero-dimensional abelian monopole moduli spaces are called of simple type. no four-
manifold with b+
2 > 1 is known which is not of simple type. we will restrict ourselves
to manifolds of simple type. the generalization to positive-dimensional monopole moduli
spaces should be straightforward from the explicit formulas in [84] and our own results.

the general form of the contribution to the generating function(cid:10)epo+i(s)(cid:11) from the

twisted abelian monopole theory at a given singularity was presented in [84]. it contains

2this is so for the monopole and dyon singularities; at the semiclassical singularity, the distinguished

vector multiplet is the original electric one.

certain eective gravitational couplings as well as contact terms among the observables.

2 = 1 and xed j, (6.61) exhibits a
determined by wall crossing as follows [84]. for b+
wall-crossing behaviour when   j changes sign. at such points, the only discontinuity
comes from swn(), which jumps by 1. therefore, the discontinuity in (6.61) is:

(6.62)

(we have set  +  = 4, which is equivalent to b+
2 = 1 for b0(x) = 1, b1(x) = 0.) the
crucial point now is that the complete expression for the generating function cannot have
wall-crossing discontinuities at nite values of z. this is not dicult to understand if
one realizes that nothing physically (or mathematically) special occurs at the singular
points: when expressed in terms of the appropriate variables, and once all the relevant
degrees of freedom are taken into account, the low-energy eective description is perfectly
smooth there. the conclusion is therefore that the discontinuity in the u-plane integral
has to cancel against the discontinuity in the contribution from the eective theory at
the singularity. as shown in [84], this suces to x the unknown functions cj, pj, lj in
(6.61).

at a generic vacuum, the su(2)  or, more generally, the so(3)  rank-3 bundle e
is broken down to e = l2  o  l2 by the higgs mechanism, where o is the trivial
line bundle (where the neutral n = 4 multiplet lives), while l2 are globally dened line
bundles where the charged massive w  n = 4 multiplets live. with our conventions,
c1(l2) = 2c1(l) = 2  2h 2(x, zz) + w2(e), which is indeed an integral class. the
monopole becoming massless at the semiclassical singularity is just one of the original
electrically charged (massive) quarks, which sits in an n = 4 abelian multiplet together
with the n = 2 vector multiplet of one of the massive w bosons. the corresponding

duality in topological quantum field theories

basic classes are therefore of the form:

x = 21 = 2c1(l2) = 4  4h 2(x, zz) + 2w2(e),

105

(6.63)

which are even classes since the manifold x is spin3. notice that, because of (6.63), not
all the basic classes of x will contribute to the computation at z1. rather, only those

and we have taken into account that, near z = z1, a1 = a  a(z1) = a0q1/2 +    . by
comparing (6.65) with the wall-crossing formula for the integral at z1, (6.55), we can
determine the unknown functions in (6.61). we nd, for example,

in (6.72) there is an extra phase (1)/8 that we have supressed. the reason for this
is that, as stated in a theorem by rohlin [29], on smooth, compact, spin four-manifolds,
  16zz. this is in contrast with the weaker arithmetic result   8zz which follows from
the evenness of the intersection form. we will restrict ourselves to such four-manifolds
and hence supress this phase in what follows.

6.4.4 the formula for the generating function

the complete formula for the generating function of the theory on simply-connected spin
four-manifolds of simple type is given by the combination of (6.70), (6.72) and (6.73),
summed over the basic classes (we do not sum over t hooft uxes, though). the contri-
bution from the u-plane integral is absent, since it vanishes for manifolds with b+
2 > 1.
as for the as yet unknown function f (m, , , 0), it is not possible to determine it com-
pletely in the context of the u-plane approach. however, we will propose an ansatz for
this function, which is motivated by a series of natural conditions that it has to satisfy.
as we will show, with our ansatz the partition function is dimensionless and displays two
properties of the partition function of the twisted n = 4 supersymmetric theory consid-
it is a modular form of weight /2 and contains the
ered by vafa and witten [100]:
donaldson invariants in the form shown in [26]. in addition, its nal expression reduces
to the vafa-witten partition function on k3.

our ansatz for f (m, , , 0), which turns out to satisfy the properties stated above,

is:

f (m, , , 0) = 

i


2(3+7)/8 m(3+7)/8(0)12.

(6.75)

in [59] a dierent choice for f was made

f (m, , , 0) = 

i


2(3+7)/8 m/8(0)12,

(6.76)

the only dierence being that the generating function therein contained an overall factor
m3(2+3)/8.
if we insist that the generating function be adimensional  see [79]  the
correct choice is of course (6.75).

taking (6.70), (6.72) and (6.73), the formula that one obtains for the generating
function of all the topological correlation functions for simply-connected spin manifolds

108

is the following:

(6.77)

where the sumpx is over all the seiberg-witten basic classes. this formula can be written

in terms of modular forms by substituting the explicit expressions (3.18) for j and (3.19)
for the periods. notice that there is no need to resolve the square roots in (3.19). indeed,
the periods in (6.77) are raised to the power ( + /4). since the manifold x is spin,
 = 0 mod 16, so /4 is even. as for  = ( + )/4, it is only guaranteed4 that   zz.
nevertheless, as explained in sect. 11.5 of [84], one can take advantage of the following
property of the seiberg-witten invariants nx  see [110] for a quick proof:

nx = (1)nx.

(6.78)

i

2 (dz/da)j xs average to a cosine
upon summing over x and x using (6.78), the factors e
when  is even, and to a sine when  is odd. therefore, no odd powers of (dz/da)j appear
in (6.77). note that as x is an even class on spin manifolds, x/2 is always an integer, and
therefore the phase (1) x
2 does not spoil the argument. likewise, if x + 2 = 0 mod 4,
it is also true that x + 2 = 0 mod 4 (x is an even class), so if a given basic class x
contributes to the rst term in (6.77) , so does x.

we will now work out a more explicit formula for the partition function (setting p = 0
and s = 0 in (6.77)). notice that, since the partition function does not care about
whether the manifold is simply-connected or not, at least in the simple-type case (in any
case, we are not computing correlation functions of observables), we can easily extend
our result to the non simply-connected case. as in [100] this extension involves the
introduction of a factor 2b1 in two of the three contributions. notice also that, because
of (6.78), the partition function is zero when  is odd, since nx + nx = nx(1 + (1)).
therefore, in the following formula for the partition function we assume that  is even.
upon substituting eqs. (3.18) and (3.19) in (6.77), and taking into account the identities

4 for x = 2 = 2c1( l) a basic class,  is the index of the corresponding dirac operator

d : (x, s+  l)  (x, s  l), which is always an integer [110].

(6.80)

the constraint x = 4y in the rst term in (6.80) means that one has to consider only those
basic classes x  4h 2(x, zz). notice that this constraint implies that the corresponding
contribution vanishes unless x2 = 2 + 3 = 8 +  = 16y2 = 0 mod 32. notice that
as  is even and   16zz, it is only guaranteed that 2 + 3 = 0 mod 16. when
2 + 3 = 0 mod 32, the rst singularity contributes to the su(2) partition function, and
the leading behaviour of the partition function is

z0  q0 + o(q0+1).

(6.81)

as in [100], the leading contribution could be interpreted as the contribution of the trivial
connection, shifted from (q0)0 to q0 by the c-number we referred to above. but notice
that the next power in the series expansion is q0+1. the gap between the trivial connec-
tion contribution and the rst non-trivial instanton contribution which was noted in [100]
for the vafa-witten partition function is not present here: all instanton congurations
contribute to zsu (2).

on the other hand, when 2 + 3 = 16(2j + 1), j  zz, the rst singularity does
not contribute to the partition function and the leading behaviour comes from the strong
coupling singularities. then z0 has an expansion:
16 + o(q0

which means summing over all allowed t hooft uxes. one nds in this way:

6.5 duality transformations of the generating func-

tion

in this section we will study the properties under duality transformations of the generating
function (6.77). we will start by checking the modular properties of z(0) as given in
(6.79). as explained in [100], one should expect the following behaviour under the modular
group. under a t transformation, taking 0  0 + 1, the partition function for xed 
must transform into itself with a possible anomalous -dependent phase. indeed, (6.79)
behaves under t in the expected fashion:

z(0 + 1) = i2

z(0).

(6.85)

checking (6.85) involves some tricky steps that we now explain. let us rewrite (6.79) as:

actually so is because of the constraint  +x/2 = 0 mod 2. indeed, when  +x/2 = 0 mod 2
we have 2 = x2/4 mod 4, and therefore

i2

= ix2/4 = i(2+3)/4 = i2+/4 = 1,

(6.91)

which guarantees that z is invariant (up to a phase) under 0  0 + 1.
following behaviour:

likewise, under an s transformation, taking 0  1/0, one should expect the

it turns out that the partition function (6.79) indeed satises (6.92). in fact,

i(cid:17)/2x

(6.92)

(6.93)

in order to check (6.93), one has to use the modular properties of the dierent functions
in (6.79), which are compiled in the appendix in sect. 6.7, and handle with care the
summation over uxes in (6.93). the following identities are useful:

to prove these identities, we borrow from eq. (5.40) of [100] the following formulas:

(1)zyz,z = (1)yz
xz
(1)zy = 2b2y,0,
(1)zyiz2

= 2b2/2i/2+y2

.

(6.95)

in addition to this, we have to take into account that, since the manifold is spin,  =
0 mod 16, x  2h 2(x, zz), and x  , 2  2zz. similarly, one should not forget to impose
the constraint   2zz.

using (6.80) and (6.83), one nds the following duality transformation properties for

the su(2) and so(3) partition functions:

zsu (2)(0 + 1) = zsu (2)(0),

zso(3)(0 + 2) = zso(3)(0),

zsu (2)(1/0) = 2/20/2zso(3)(0).

(6.96)

as expected, the partition function for so(3) does not transform properly under 0 
0 + 1, but transforms into itself under 0  0 + 2. hence, the su(2) or so(3) partition
funcions are invariant under the subgroup 0(2)  sl(2, zz).

we will now analyse the behaviour of the topological correlation functions under mod-
ular transformations. first, it is useful to work out how the dierent terms entering (6.77)
transform. under 0  1/0 we have,

z1  0

2z2,

z2  0

z3  0

(6.98)

at rst sight, the behaviour of hi(s)i under 0  1/0 seems rather unnatural. since
i(s) is essentially the magnetic ux operator of the theory, one would expect that it should

transform under s into the corresponding electric ux operator j(s) rs tr (  f ) of

the dual theory. however, this operator (or any appropriate generalization thereof) does
not give rise to topological invariants, so one could question whether it should play any
role at all. likewise, one would like to understand the origin of the shift hoi (s  s) in
the transformation of hi(s)i(s)i.
these a priori puzzling behaviours are quite natural when analysed from the viewpoint
of abelian electric-magnetic duality5. in fact, there exists a simple abelian topological
model whose correlation functions mimic the behaviour in (6.98) under electric-magnetic
duality.

this model contains an abelian gauge eld a, whose eld strength is dened as
f = da, two neutral scalar elds , , a grassmann-odd neutral one-form  and a
grassmann-odd neutral two-form . the lagrangian is simply the topological density

(6.99)

plus conventional kinetic terms for the rest of the elds:

l0 =

0f  f + im 0 d  d + im 0   d.

(6.100)

this lagrangian possesses the following brst symmetry:

[q, a] = ,

{q, } = d,

[q, ] = [q, ] = {q, } = 0.

(6.101)

notice that the non-holomorphic metric-dependent dependence on 0 in (6.100) is brst-
exact:

im 0 (d  d +   d) = im 0{q,   d    f}.

(6.102)

therefore, the partition functionr d[a, , , , , ]er l0 is metric-independent and a priori

holomorphic in 0.

the presence of magnetic sources in the theory is mimicked by imposing the conditions:

zsa

f = 2na,

na  zz,

(6.103)

where the {sa}a=1,b2(x) are two-cycles representing a basis of h2(x, ir). notice that

indeedrs f gives the magnetic ux of f through s. owing to (6.103), f can be decom-
posed as f = da + 2pa na[sa], where a is a one-form in x and [sa] are closed two-forms
representing a basis of h 2(x, ir) dual to {sa}. with these conventions, the piece inr l0

containing the eld strength is simply

summation over the magnetic uxes na.

with qab = rx[sa]  [sb] = (sa  sb) the intersection form of the manifold. the func-
tional integralr da el0 therefore involves a continuous integration over a plus a discrete
we wish to calculate the correlation functions h2i and hrs(2f +   )i, and anal-

yse their behaviour under duality transformations. for this we consider the generating
functional:

(6.106)

notice that the operators 2 andrs(2f +) are brst-invariant. this guarantees,

in the usual fashion, the topological invariance of the generating function (6.105).

it is possible to rewrite (6.105) in terms of an equivalent, dual theory, which is also
a topological abelian model of the same sort, but with an inverted coupling constant
 d
0 = 1/0. the details are similar to those in conventional electric-magnetic duality
for abelian gauge theories [98][101][111]: one introduces a lagrange multiplier ad to
enforce the constraint f = da in the functional integral. this ad can be thought of as
a connection on a dual magnetic line bundle. its eld strength fd = dad is taken to

have quantized uxes through the cycles sa: fd = dad + 2pa ma[sa]. to deal with the

other elds, we augment the quintet {f, , , , } with a dual abelian eld strength fd,
a dual neutral grassmann-odd one-form d, dual neutral scalars d, d, a dual neutral
grassmann-odd two-form d, bosonic four-form multipliers b, b, a grassmann-odd three-
form multiplier  and a grassmann-odd two-form multiplier , and consider the extended

by integrating out the dual elds fd, d, d, d and d, and the multipliers b, b, , ,
it is straightforward to verify that the generating functional:

l(p,s),

(6.108)

where now the integration over f is unrestricted, represents the same theory as (6.105).
the dual formulation can be achieved by integrating out instead the original elds f , ,

6.6 more properties of the generating function

in this section we will analyse more properties of the generating function (6.77). first,
we will study its behaviour in the massless limit m  0, then we will show that the
donaldson invariants are contained in the partition function by studying the n = 2 limit
(m  ) and, nally, we will show that on k3 it reduces to the one obtained by vafa
and witten for another twist of the n = 4 supersymmetric theory.

6.6.1 massless limit

we wish to analyse the behaviour of (6.77) and (6.79) in the limit m  0 holding 0
xed. since we have factorized out the overall dependence on m, the analysis here is
much simpler than that in [59] but leads to a somewhat puzzling result. notice that all
the dependence on m in the generating function is contained in the observables. consider
a certain correlation function ho(1)   o(r)i. the observable insertions carry an explicit
mass dependence dictated by their ghost number (6.41), so we have

ho(1)   o(r)i  mp r

n=1 gn/2,

(6.112)

where gn is the ghost number of the observable o(n). as the exponent in (6.112) is always
positive, all the correlation functions vanish in the limit m  0 whatever the values of 
and  be. notice that one would generically expect that the correlation functions should
be non-zero unless 2 + 3  0. however, on manifolds with b+
2 > 1, the topological
correlation functions are given by the contributions from the singularities in the moduli
space of the physical theory. in the massless limit, the three singularities of the low-energy

duality in topological quantum field theories

117

description of the physical n = 4 theory collapse to a unique singularity at u = 0. this
is a superconformal point where we generically expect all the correlation functions other
than the partition function (which is itself the vacuum expectation value of the identity
operator) to vanish. thus, the vanishing of the topological correlation functions could be
thought of as an eect of the superconformal invariance of the undelying n = 4 theory.
anyhow, one should not take these results too seriously. the generating function was
derived for generic values of the mass m (and in particular for non-zero values of the
mass), so it is not clear that setting m = 0 is meaningful at all.

6.6.2 the n = 2 limit and the donaldson-witten invariants

we would like to analyse the fate of our formulas for the generating function under the
decoupling limit m  , q0  0, holding 0, the scale of the nf = 0 theory, xed:
4m4q0 = 0
4. in this limit, the singularities at strong coupling evolve to the singularities
of the n = 2, nf = 0 su(2) theory, while the semiclassical singularity goes to innity and
disappears. while this limit is perfectly well-dened for the seiberg-witten curve, it is not
clear whether the corresponding explicit expressions for the prepotentials and the periods
should remain non-singular as well. the question therefore arises as to whether taking
this naive limit in the twisted theory could give a non-singular result, that is whether,
starting from (6.77) or (6.79), one could recover the corresponding expressions for the
twisted (pure) su(2) n = 2 supersymmetric theory. this limit has been systematically
studied for the twisted n = 2 gauge theory with nf hypermultiplets in the fundamental
representation (and nf < 4) in [79]. dijkgraaf et al.
[26] considered the same limit
for the vafa-witten partition function, and they were able to single out a piece which
corresponds to the partition function of the twisted n = 2 supersymmetric theory as rst
computed by witten [110]. we will go a step further and recover, in the same limit, the
full generating function for the donaldson-witten invariants.

we will focus on the generating function (6.77). we will keep the leading terms in
the series expansion of the dierent modular functions in powers of q0. we will use the
explicit formulas:

g(q0

2) = 1/q0
1/2) = 1/q0
1/2) = 1/q0

2 +    ,
1/2 +    ,

6.6.3 the partition function on k3

we now specialize to k3. this is a compact hyper-kahler manifold, and as such one would
expect [109] the physical and the twisted theories to coincide. therefore, our formulas
are to be considered as true predictions for the partition function and a selected set of
correlation functions of the physical n = 4 so(3) gauge theory on k3.

duality in topological quantum field theories

119

only the zero class x = 0 contributes on k3, and nx=0 = 1. moreover,  = 24 and

 = 16, so  = 2 and 2 + 3 = 0. the answer for k3 is therefore:

even further and present the full generating function on k3:

g(q0

(6.120)

notice that the correlation functions, which follow from (6.120), are proportional to
the mass m, and therefore all vanish (except for the partition function) when m  0, as
expected.

the generating function for su(2) is obtained from (6.120) by simply setting  = 0

and dividing by 2:

(cid:10)epo+i(s)(cid:11)k3

su (2) =

g(q0

1/2) e2pz3+s2t3.

(6.121)

the corresponding expression for so(3) bundles is given by the sum of (6.120) over all
t hooft uxes. as explained in [100], the allowed t hooft uxes on k3 can be grouped
into dierent dieomorphism classes, which are classied by the value of 2 modulo 4 (k3
is spin, so 2 is always even). there are three dierent possibilities and, correspondingly,
three dierent generating functions to be computed:  = 0, with multiplicity n0 = 1,
gives just the su(2) partition function;  6= 0, 2  4zz, with multiplicity neven = (222 +
211)/2  1; and 2 = 2 mod 4, with multiplicity nodd = (222  211)/2. the so(3) answer
is the sum of the three generating functions (with the appropriate multiplicities):

(cid:10)epo+i(s)(cid:11)k3

so(3) =(cid:10)epo+i(s)(cid:11)k3

all these generating functions behave under duality as dictated by (6.85), (6.92) and
(6.98). in particular, the s transformation exchanges the su(2) and so(3) generating
functions according to (6.96) and (6.98).

adjoint non-abelian monopoles

here we collect some useful formulas which should help the reader follow the computations
in this chapter. a more detailed account can be found in appendices a and b of [84]. a
very useful review containing denitions and properties of many modular forms can be
found in appendices a and f of [53].

(1)nqn2/2 = 1  2q1/2 + 2q2 +    ,

where q = e2i . they satisfy the identity:

3( )4 = 2( )4 + 4( )4,

and they have the following properties under modular transformations:

4(1/ ) =p 

i 4( ),
i 3( ),
i 2( ),

2( + 1) = ei/42( ),
3( + 1) = 4( ),
4( + 1) = 3( ).

(6.123)

(6.124)

(6.125)

from these, the modular properties of the functions ej (3.11) follow straightforwardly:

e1(1/0) = 0
e2(1/0) = 0
e3(1/0) = 0

2e2(0),
2e1(0),
2e3(0),

e1(0 + 1) = e1(0),
e2(0 + 1) = e3(0),
e3(0 + 1) = e2(0).

(6.126)

notice that, from their denition, e1 + e2 + e3 = 0. likewise, we can determine explic-
itly the behaviour of the functions j (3.18) and of the periods (3.19) under modular
transformations:

1(1/0) = 0
2(1/0) = 0
3(1/0) = 0

the amphicheiral theory

7.1 the twisted theory

the last theory we will consider was briey introduced at the end of reference [114], and
afterwards it was considered in detail in [14][56][73]. it corresponds to the decomposition
(see chapter 4) 4  (2, 1)  (1, 2), but it is easier (and equivalent) to start from the
second twisted theory and replace su(2)r with the diagonal sum su(2)r of su(2)r itself
and the remaining isospin group su(2)f (this is very much alike to a conventional n = 2
twisting). this introduces in the theory a second brst-like symmetry, which comes from
the n = 4 spinor supercharges qv . as we pointed out at before, there are several unusual
features to this theory that we think deserve a detailed analysis. we begin by recalling the
fundamentals of the second twist. the symmetry group h = su(2)l  su(2)r  su(4)i
of the original n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory is twisted to give the symmetry
group h = su(2)l  su(2)r  su(2)f  u(1) (we will refer to this as the l twist) of
 and qv  decompose under h as:
the half-twisted theory. the supersymmetry charges qv
()  q(1)
(7.1)

  qv   q(+1)  q(+1)

qv

i  q(1)

   q(+1)
i  .

but one can also twist with su(2)r thus obtaining its corresponding mirror t twist with
symmetry group h = su(2)l  su(2)r  su(2)f  u(1) (r twist). both formulations
are related (4.8) through an orientation reversal and a change of sign in 0. now we can
twist su(2)f away in four dierent ways. two of these (ll and rr) take us back to
the vafa-witten twists t and t . the other two (lr and rl) should lead us to the
twist considered in [14][73] and its corresponding t twist. the non-trivial result is that
either of these two dierent choices leads to the same topological theory. this can be
seen as follows. pick one of the possibilities, say, lr. after the rst twist we have the
half-twisted theory with symmetry group h and supersymmetry charges (7.1). if we now
twist su(2)f with su(2)r we obtain, from the last charge in (7.1), a second scalar charge
q given by:

qi   q    q = c

  q  .

(7.2)

125

126

the amphicheiral theory

notice that both the anticommuting symmetries, q and q, have the same ghost
number, so they are both to be considered either as brst or anti-brst operators. this
is in contrast with the situation we found in the vafa-wittten twist where, after explicitly
breaking the isospin group su(2)f down to its t3 subgroup, we ended up with two scalar
charges q(+) and q() with opposite ghost numbers, which were then interpreted as a
brst-antibrst system.

the elds of the new theory can be obtained from those in the half-twisted theory as

follows:

a 
v
v

uv

(1)

(+1)

(1)
(+1)
 , (1),
 
(+1)
  , (1), (1)
 
b(2), c (+2), v (0)
 

(7.3)

where we have included also the corresponding elds of the n = 4 theory and the ghost
number carried by the twisted elds. the notation is similar to that in ref. [73]. notice
that if we exchange su(2)l by su(2)r the eld content in (7.3) does not change. this
in turn implies that the lr and rl twists are in fact the same,

slr
x = srl
x ,

(7.4)

or, in other words, the third twist leads to an amphicheiral topological quantum eld
( x denotes
theory. since it is known that the two twists are related by slr
the manifold x with the opposite orientation), it follows that by reversing the sign of the
-angle one can jump from x to x:

x (cid:12)(cid:12)00

x = srl

sx = s x(cid:12)(cid:12)00

.

(7.5)

we will see in a moment that this information is encoded in the discrete conjugation
symmetry introduced in [73].

the denitions in (7.3) are almost self-evident. the only ones which need clarication

are those corresponding to  and   . our conventions are:

the next thing to do is to obtain the symmetry transformations which correspond to the
new model. recall that we have now two fermionic charges q and q. the transformations
generated by q are easily obtained from those in the previous twist (6.7). to obtain the
transformations generated by q we must return to the n = 4 theory. let us recall
. the
that the n = 4 supersymmetry transformations are generated by v

making the replacement

now consider the following discrete transformations acting on the elds of the theory:

+   (  ,

  ,

c  c,
v  v,
   ,
  ,
f +  f  (f  f,

f    f.

(7.14)

notice that these transformations involve the simultaneous replacement mnpq  mnpq ,
which is equivalent to a reversal of the orientation of the four-manifold x. because of
this orientation reversal, the sign of the theta-term in (7.11) is also reversed. thus the
zz2-like transformations (7.14) map the action on x to the same action on x but with
0. this is precisely the information encoded in (7.5).
it is also noteworthy that the transformations (7.14) exchange the brst generators
q and q  one can see this by looking at (7.12).
indeed, had we not known about
the existence of one of the topological symmetries, say q, we would have discovered it
immediately with the aid of the symmetry (7.14). in addition to this, one can readily see
that the replacements dictated by (7.14) preserve the ghost number assignments of the
elds. in what follows, we will usually refer to the transformations (7.14) by zz2, but the
reader must be aware of this abuse of notation.

several things remain to be done. it would be desirable to obtain an o-shell formula-
tion of the model. besides, it would be interesting to nd out whether the o-shell action
(provided that it exists) can be written as a q- (or q, or both) commutator, and write
down the explicit expression for the corresponding gauge fermion. and nally, the theory
should be generalized to any arbitrary four-manifold of euclidean signature.

we have found a complete o-shell formulation involving both brst symmetries
simultaneously such that the action (7.11) is (up to appropriate theta-terms) q and q-
exact.

let us examine these results in more detail. the on-shell algebra (7.13) can be ex-
mn, nmn and p , which have zero
tended o-shell by introducing the auxiliary elds n +
ghost number and are taken to transform under zz2 as n +  n, p  p . in terms
of these elds, the transformations (7.12) are modied as follows:

  = 22mv m + p,
p = 4m m + 42i[m, vm] + 22i[, c],
mn = 22([mvn]) + nmn,

mn,

(7.15)
the other transformations in (7.12) remain the same. equivalent formulas hold for q and
are related to those in (7.15) through the zz2 transformation. in this o-shell realization
the auxiliary elds appear in the action only quadratically, that is,

s(1) = s(0) +z tr(cid:26) 1

(n +)2 +

p 2(cid:27) .

(7.16)

the action s(1) can be written either as a q commutator or as a q commutator and is
invariant under both, q and q, that is,

s(1) = {q,b+}  2ik0 = { q,b}  2ik0 ;

where the gauge fermions b are not equal but are formally interchanged by the zz2

transformation and k is the instanton number (4.2). it is possible to redene the auxiliary
elds to cast either the q or the q transformations (but not both simultaneously) in the
standard form,

[q,s(1)] = 0 = [ q,s(1)],

(7.17)

{q, antighost} = auxiliary field,
[q, auxiliary field] = gaugeantighost,

(7.18)

which is essential to make contact with the mathai-quillen interpretation. performing
the shifts,

p  p + 22mv m,
nmn  nmn  22([mvn]),
mn  n +
n +

mn + f +

mn  2i([vm, vn])+,

which can be guessed from (7.15), the q transformations take the simple form:

2 m,

am = 2m,
vm = 
c = 0,
b = 2,
  = p,
mn = n +

nmn = 22i[mn, c].

(7.19)

(7.20)

duality in topological quantum field theories

the point is that if instead of (7.19) we make the zz2 conjugate shifts,

p  p + 22mv m,
n +
mn  n +
nmn  nmn  f mn + 2i([vm, vn]),

mn  22([mvn])+,

it is    q the one which can be cast in the simple form:

p = 22i[, c],

(7.22)

notice that since the appropriate shifts are in each case dierent, the one which simplies
the q transformations makes the corresponding q transformations (not shown) much
more complicated and conversely, the shift which simplies the q transformations makes
the corresponding q transformations (not shown) much more complicated.

keeping these results in mind, from now on we will focus on the q formulation, that
is, on the o-shell formulation in which the q transformations take the form (7.20). the
o-shell action which corresponds to this formulation is:

now we switch on an arbitrary background metric g of euclidean signature. this is
straightforward once we have expressed the model in the form of eqs. (7.20) and (7.24).

if we integrate out the auxiliary elds in (7.27) we recover the action (7.11). to close the
analysis in this section we shall state the relation between our model and those presented
in [14][73]. after integrating out the auxiliary elds n, our action (with 0 set to zero)
and transformations match those by marcus [73] in the  = 1 gauge, after the following
redenitions (marcus elds and charges are denoted by a subscript m):

qm =

generators t with the antihermitean generators tm = it .

7.2 the theory in the mathai-quillen approach

the relevant basic equations for this model can be identied from the xed points of the 
symmetry transformations (7.12). they involve the self-dual part of the gauge connection
f + and a real vector eld v taking values in the adjoint representation of some nite
dimensional compact lie group g:

  i[v, v]+ = 0,
f +

(cid:0)d[v](cid:1) = 0,

dv  = 0.

(7.30)



7.2.1 the topological framework

the geometrical setting is a certain compact, oriented riemannian four-manifold x, and
the eld space is m = a1(x, adp ), where a is the space of connections on a principal
g-bundle p  x, and the second factor denotes, as we have already seen before, 1-forms
on x taking values in the lie algebra of g. the group g of gauge transformations of the
bundle p has an action on the eld space which is given locally by:

g(a) = i(dg)g1 + gag1,
g(v ) = gv g1,

(7.31)

where v  1(x, adp ) and a is the gauge connection. in terms of the covariant derivative
da = d + i[a, ], the innitesimal form of the transformations (7.31), with g = exp(ic)
and c  0(x, adp ), takes the form:

g(c)a = dac,
g(c)v = i[v, c].

the basic equations (7.30) are introduced in this framework as sections of the triv-
ial vector bundle v = m  f , where the bre is in this case f = 2,+(x, adp ) 
2,(x, adp )  0(x, adp ). taking into account the form of the basic equations, the
section reads:

(v )(x, adp ).

tr(   )

(7.33)

s(a, v ) =(cid:0)2(f +

  i[v, v]+), 4(d[v] ),2dv (cid:1).

the section (7.34), being gauge ad-equivariant, descends to a section s of the associated
vector bundle mgf whose zero locus gives precisely the moduli space of the topological
theory. it would be desirable to compute the dimension of this moduli space. the relevant
deformation complex is the following:

(7.34)

0  0(x, adp ) c1

(a)(x, adp )  1

(v )(x, adp )

ds2,+(x, adp )  2,(x, adp )  0(x, adp )  0.

the map c : 0(x, adp )  tm is given by:

c(c) = (dac, i[v, c]), c  0(x, adp ),

(7.35)

(7.36)

while the map ds : t(a,v )m  f is given by the linearization of the basic equations
(7.30):

ds(, ) =(cid:0)4(d[])+ + 4i[ [, v]]+,

4(d[

]) + 4i[[, v]],2d  + 2i[, v ](cid:1).

(7.37)

under suitable conditions, the index of the complex (7.35) computes the dimension of
ker(ds)/im(c). to calculate its index, the complex can be split up into the asd-instanton
deformation complex:

(1) 0  0(x, adp )

da1(x, adp )

p+da2,+(x, adp )  0,

and the complex associated to the operator

which is easily seen to correspond to the instanton deformation complex for self-dual
(sd) connections. thus, the index of the total complex (which gives minus the virtual
dimension of the moduli space) is:

where p1(adp ) is the rst pontryagin class of the adjoint bundle adp ,  is the euler
characteristic of the 4-manifold x and  is its signature.

7.2.2 the topological action

we now proceed as in the previous cases. to build a topological theory out of the moduli
problem dened by the equations (7.30), we need the following multiplet of elds. for the
eld space m = a 1(x, adp ) we introduce the gauge connection a and the one-form
v, both commuting and with ghost number 0. for the (co)tangent space t(a,v )m =
(v )(x, adp ) we introduce the anticommuting elds  and , both
1
(a)(x, adp )  1
with ghost number 1 and which can be seen as dierential forms on the moduli space. for
the bre f = 2,+(x, adp )  2,(x, adp )  0(x, adp ) we have anticommuting elds
with the quantum numbers of the equations, namely a self-dual two-form +
, an anti-self-
dual two-form  and a 0-form , all with ghost number 1, and their superpartners,
a commuting self-dual two-form n +
, a commuting anti-self-dual two-form n and a
commuting 0-form p , all with ghost number 0 and which appear as auxiliary elds in
the associated eld theory. and nally, associated to the gauge symmetry, we introduce
a commuting scalar eld c  0(x, adp ) with ghost number +2, and a multiplet of
scalar elds b (commuting and with ghost number 2) and  (anticommuting and with
ghost number 1), both also in 0(x, adp ) and which enforce the horizontal projection
m  m/g [20]. the brst symmetry of the model is given by:

[q, a] = ,
[q, v] = ,
[q, c] = 0,
{q, +
} = n +
,
{q, } = n,

{q, } = p,
[q, b] = ,

{q, } = dc,
{q,  } = i [v, c],

] = i [+

[q, n +
, c],
[q, n] = i [, c],

[q, p ] = i [, c],
{q,  } = i [b, c].

(7.41)

duality in topological quantum field theories

137

this brst algebra closes up to a gauge transformation generated by c.

we have to give now the expressions for the dierent pieces of the gauge fermion. for

the localization gauge fermion we have:

 loc = h(+, , ), s(a, v )i + h(+, , ), (n +, n, p )i =

zx

+

+

(cid:0) n +  2f + + 2i[v , v ]+(cid:1)
g tr(cid:8) 1
(cid:0) n + 4(d[v ])(cid:1) + (cid:0) p + 2dv (cid:1)(cid:9),

1
2

while for the projection gauge fermion, which enforces the horizontal projection, we have:

proj = hb,c(, )ig =zx

g tr(cid:8) b(cid:0)d + i[ , v ](cid:1)(cid:9).

as in the other cases we have studied, it is necessary to add an extra piece to the gauge
fermion to make full contact with the corresponding twisted supersymmetric theory. in
this case, this extra term is:

extra =zx

[b, c](cid:9).

it is now straightforward to see that, with the redenitions

(7.46)

one recovers, in terms of the primed elds, the twisted model summarized in (7.25) and
(7.26), which corresponds to the topological symmetry q.

it is worth to remark that one could also consider the dual problem built out of the

basic equations:

f   i[v, v] = 0,


(cid:0) d[v](cid:1)+ = 0,

dv  = 0.

the resulting theory corresponds precisely to the second type of theory obtained in the
previous section in our discussion of the third twist. the corresponding action has the form
{ q, } where q is given in (7.22) and  is the result of performing a zz2-transformation
(see (7.14)) on the gauge fermion + in (7.24).

7.3 observables

the amphicheiral theory

in this section we will analyze the structure of the observables of the theory. observ-
ables are operators which are q-invariant but are not q-exact. a quick look at the
q-transformations (7.12) shows that the observables are basically the same as in ordinary
donaldson-witten theory. however, as there are two anticommuting brst charges with
the same ghost number, there exist correspondingly, two possible sets of operators:

w0 =tr(c 2),

w2 =tr(

w1 =2tr(c  ),
1
2
   +
tr(  f ),

w3 =

c  f ),

w0 =tr(c 2),
w1 = 
w2 =tr(

2tr(c  ),
1
1
   +
2
2

tr(   f ).

w3 = 

c  f ),

(7.47)

they satisfy the descent equations [q, wi} = dwi1, [ q, wi} = d wi1, which as we know
imply that

o(i) =zi

wi,

and

o(j ) =zi

wi,

(7.48)

it is interesting to note that w0,1
for given homology cyles j of x, are observables.
and w0,1 give observables which are invariant under both, q and q. what is more, the
[ q, tr(c  v )], so it does not contribute to vacuum
operator w1 is q-exact, w1 =  12
expectation values containing only q-closed observables like o(0), o(1) itself and, as we
shall see in a moment, o(2) (besides the o(i)). indeed, it is possible to modify w2 adding
an irrelevant q-exact piece so that the resulting observable is invariant under both, q
and q. the perturbed two-form,

22(cid:8) q, tr(   v )(cid:9)

c  (f + 2iv  v )(cid:9)

is both q and q-closed up to exact forms

[q, w 2] = [q, w2] = dw1,

[ q, w 2] = d w1.

the two-form w 2 descends to a three-form in the cohomology of q,

dw 2 = {q, w 3}, w 3 =

d(   v )(cid:1),

(7.49)

(7.50)

(7.51)

duality in topological quantum field theories

139

which is again the original three-form w3 plus a (irrelevant) perturbation. however, this
form is not q-closed. we have not been able to nd an appropriate additional irrelevant
perturbation which would render w3 q-closed.

completely analogous arguments hold for the operators wi. thus, the even operators
w0, w 2, w0 and w 2 lead to observables corresponding to the even homology classes of
the four-manifold x which are invariant under both q and q.

topological invariants are obtained by considering the vacuum expectation value of

arbitrary products of observables:

o(j )+ ,

(7.52)

*yj

where it should be understood that qj o(j ) denotes products of operators o(i) and
o(j ). the general form of this vacuum expectation value is,

*yj

o(j )+ =xk *yj

o(j )+

k

e2ik0,

(7.53)

where k is the instanton number and hqj o(j )ik is the vacuum expectation value com-

puted at a xed value of k with an action which is q-exact,

*yj

o(j )+

k

=z [df ]ke{q,}yj

o(j ).

(7.54)

in this equation [df ]k denotes collectively the measure indicating that only gauge con-
gurations of instanton number k enter in the functional integral. these quantities are
independent of the coupling constant e0. when analyzed in the weak coupling limit the
contributions to the functional integral come from eld congurations which are solutions
to the equations (7.30). all the dependence of the observables on 0 is contained in the
sum (7.53).

the q-symmetry of the theory imposses a selection rule for the products entering
(7.52) which could lead to a possibly non-vanishing result: the ghost number of (7.52)
must be equal to the virtual dimension of the corresponding moduli space. in this case
the virtual dimension is not zero but it is independent of the instanton number k, so
one could obtain contributions from many values of k. possibly non-trivial topological
invariants for these cases correspond to products of operators (7.52) such that their ghost
number matches the virtual dimension dim(g). one important question is again whether
the vacuum expectation values of these observables have good modular properties under
sl(2, zz) transformations. we will now show that in fact these vacuum expectation
values are actually independent of 0. thus, in some sense the invariance under sl(2, zz)
is trivially realized in this case.

to see how this comes about, let us consider the action (7.17) (in its covariantized
form) in which the auxiliary elds appear quadratically. the bosonic part of this action

now in the short-distance limit the path integral is dominated by the quadratic bosonic
terms in the action. in the rst case, the contributions come from the moduli space dened
by eqs. (7.30). notice that the normalization factor for v in (7.45) has to be taken into
account since (7.55) corresponds to the action resulting after the twisting. similarly, in
the second case the contributions come from the moduli space dened by eqs. (7.46). as
for the third case, however, the contributions come from congurations which solve the
following set of equations:

f  2i[v, v] = 0,
d[v] = 0,
dv  = 0,

(7.58)



which dene a moduli space which is the intersection of the other two. this is the moduli
space which appears in the formulation of the third twist presented in [14][73].

there are two dierent ways to understand that the theory indeed localizes on the

1

moduli space dened by (7.58). on the one hand, from the identity s = 1

2{q,b+} +
2{ q,b}  2ikre(0), one can see that vacuum expectation values hqj o(j)i are inde-

pendent of the coupling constant e0 as long as the observables are simultaneously invariant

duality in topological quantum field theories

141

under both, q and q. in the case at hand this is true at least for vacuum expectation
values involving products of operators o(0), o(2), and o(0), o(2). on the other hand,
one could extend wittens arguments leading to his xed-point theorem [108], to argue
that the theory should localize onto the xed points of both the brst symmetries q and
q simultaneously, that is to say on the intersection of the zero loci (7.30) and (7.46). this
could be thought of as some sort of generalized localization principle for topological eld
theories with more than one brst symmetry.

notice that the three points of view lead to three dierent types of dependence on 0.
the rst one implies that vacuum expectation values are holomorphic in 0, the second
that they are antiholomorphic, and the third that they depend only on the real part of 0.
we will solve this puzzle showing that actually the vacuum expectation values are just
real numbers and not functions of 0.

we rst prove that any solution of (7.58) must involve a gauge connection whose

instanton number is zero. indeed, from the identity,

zx

d4xg tr(cid:8)f(cid:0) f   2i[v , v ](cid:1)  4  d[v ]d[v](cid:9)

=zx

d4xg tr(cid:8)ff (cid:9),

(7.59)

follows that any solution of (7.58) must have k = 0. this implies that only congurations
with vanishing instanton number contribute and therefore:

*yj

o(j )+ =*yj

o(j )+

k=0

,

(7.60)

quantities hqj o(j )ik are dierent in each point of view. they clearly vanish in the

which is clearly independent of 0. from (7.55) and (7.56) follows that for k = 0 a solution
to the equations of the rst moduli space (7.30) is also a solution to the ones of the second
(7.46) and therefore also to the ones of the third (7.58). for k 6= 0, however, one can
have solutions to the equations of the rst moduli space which are not solutions to the
equations of the second and therefore neither to the ones of the third. for k 6= 0 the
third case. on the other hand, there is no reason why they should also vanish in the
other two cases. our results, however, suggest that they do vanish. we have shown it
at least for vacuum expectation values involving products of operators o(0), o(2), and
o(0), o(2).
we will end this section by recalling a vanishing theorem which has already been
discussed in [73] and which tells us when the third moduli space (7.58) reduces to the
moduli space of at connections. the equations (7.58) have the immediate solution v = 0,
f = 0, that is, the moduli space of at connections is contained in the moduli space dened
by the equations (7.58). we will show that under certain conditions both moduli spaces

142

are in fact the same. to see this note that since,

d4xg tr(cid:8)dvdv  + rv v  +

4(cid:0) f   2i[v , v ](cid:1)2 + 2(cid:0)d[v ](cid:1)2 +(cid:0)dv (cid:1)2(cid:9)

it follows that if the ricci tensor is such that

rv v  > 0

for v 6= 0,

(7.61)

(7.62)

the solutions to the equations (7.58) are necessarily of the form v = 0, f = 0, and thus
the moduli space is the space of at gauge connections on x.

appendix

we will now summarize the conventions used in this work. basically we will describe
the elements of the positive and negative chirality spin bundles s+ and s on a four-
dimensional spin manifold x endowed with a vierbein em and a spin connection mn
 .
the spaces of sections of the spin bundles s+ and s correspond, from the eld-theory
point of view, to the set of two-component weyl spinors dened on the manifold x.
these are the simplest irreducible representations of the holonomy group so(4). we
will denote positive-chirality (or negative-chirality) spinors by indices , , . . . = 1, 2 (or
, , . . . = 1, 2). spinor indices are raised and lowered with the su(2) invariant tensor
c (or c  ) and its inverse c  (or c  ), with the conventions c21 = c 12 = +1, so that,

can be simply written as,

d m  = 0,

d n  = 0.

(a.11)

let us now introduce a principal g-bundle p  x with its associated connection one-form
a, and let us consider that the weyl spinors m realize locally an element of (s+adp ),
i.e., they transform under a g gauge transformation in the adjoint representation  indeed,
adp is the vector bundle associated to p through the adjoint representation of the gauge
group on its lie algebra:

sentation, which are traceless and hermitian. in (a.12) a, a = 1,   , dim(g), denote
the innitesimal parameters of the gauge transformation.

given an element of (x, s+  adp ), m = (a, b) we dene m

the bre (x, s  adp ), which we dene as

forms y, z  (x, 2,+t x  adp )  2,+(x, adp ) our denition of the metric is the
following:
