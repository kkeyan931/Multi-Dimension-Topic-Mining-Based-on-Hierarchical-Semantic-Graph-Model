abstract

a consistent n = 1 supersymmetric -model can be constructed, given a kahler mani-
fold by adding chiral matter multiplets. their scalar components are covariant tensors
on the underlying kahler manifold. the kahler u (1)-charges can be adjusted such that
the anomalies cancel, using the holomorphic functions in which the kahler potential
transforms. the arbitrariness of the u (1)-charges of matter multiplets is related to
their weyl-weights in superconformal gravity, before it is reduced to supergravity. the
covariance of the kahler potential forces the superpotential to be covariant as well.
this relates the cut-o, the planck scale and the matter charges to each other. a non-
vanishing vev of the covariant superpotential breaks the kahler u (1) spontaneously.
if this vev vanishes, the gravitino is massless and depending on the above mentioned
parameters there may be additional internal symmetry breaking. the separation of
the dierent representations of chiral multiplets can be achieved by covariantizations
of derivatives and fermions. using non-holomorphic transformations, the full kahler
metric can be block-diagonalized and the necessary covariantizations come out natu-
rally. various aspects are illustrated by applying them to grassmannian coset models.
in particular a consistent model of coset su (5)/su (2)  u (1)  su (3) with the eld
content of the standard model is constructed. the phenomenology of this model is
analyzed.

1 introduction

like gravity, non-linear -models in four dimensions are not renormalizable. they
involve a natural scale  above which new dynamics or new physical degrees of
freedom can come into play. the existence of such a scale requires the intro-
duction of a parameter f  1 of inverse mass dimension. below this scale
the -models are useful as eective eld theories, for example to describe the
low-energy dynamics of bound states in strongly interacting gauge theories like
qcd. eective eld theories also arise in the low-energy description of quantum
string theory, in which case the string scale sets the limit of applicability. this
scale is connected with the planck scale, as classical gravity described in a general
relativistic formulation is part of the eective long-distance physics which comes
out of string theory.

because realistic string theories require supersymmetry for their consistency,
the most obvious candidates for eective low-energy theories arising from string
models are four-dimensional n = 1 supergravity theories, subject to phenomeno-
logical constraints as well. these theories describe gravity and the other in-
teractions in the context of a locally supersymmetric eld theory, which is not
renormalizable but well-behaved below the planck scale. with well-behaved we
mean, that by taking into account the presence of a cut-o, these theories give un-
ambiguous and consistent answers to questions related to phenomena at distance
scales large compared to the cut-o. in particular one requires the proper incor-
poration of symmetries and the absence of anomalies in local gauge-invariances
like those of the electro-weak or grand-unied interactions.

for such reasons it is important to be able to construct the most general
locally supersymmetric eld theories including local chiral and non-chiral gauge-
interactions free of anomalies at the quantum level. in this paper we address this
question within the context of conventional representations of n = 1 supersym-
metry, which besides the supergravity multiplet include complex chiral and real
vector multiplets.

the complex scalars of the chiral-multiplet sector of an n = 1 supersymmetric
theory parameterize a kahler manifold. in particular, the low-energy lagrangean
of this sector is determined by a single real function of the chiral superelds a,
the kahler potential k( , ), from which objects like the metric and curvature of
the manifold can be computed. interesting examples of kahler manifolds include
cosets of the grassmannian type [1, 2, 3, 4], and those based on exceptional groups
like e6/so(10) u(1), e7/su(5) su(3) u(1) or e8/so(10) su(3) u(1)
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
the pure n = 1 supersymmetric -models can be extended in several ways: by
adding superpotentials, by gauging some or all of the isometries and by adding ad-
ditional matter superelds in appropriate representations of the isometry group.
for model-building purposes it is necessary to analyze what kind of low-energy
physics then emerges from these models and their various extensions. this is

1

a highly non-trivial question, as supersymmetry requires the inclusion of many
rather special scalar potential terms and yukawa couplings for its consistency.
the patterns of internal and supersymmetry breaking, and of boson and fermion
masses emerging from these models can become quite intricate.

further constraints come from requiring the light particles in the model to
have assigned charges and other quantum numbers to them consistent with
standard-model phenomenology and to be free of chiral anomalies in the -model
or gauge interactions. this has been the subject of various earlier investigations
[10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. in these studies it was concluded that many models based on
mathematically interesting coset spaces like the symmetric spaces, appear to suf-
fer from problems in these respects. however, in a recent paper [15] we showed
that the u(1) charge assignments of the chiral superelds allow more freedom
then was previously thought. as a result anomaly cancellation can be realized in
phenomenologically interesting ways by combining appropriate representations
of isometry groups, even in models based on these coset spaces.
it is then of
clear importance to study which consistent eective supergravity models can be
constructed incorporating these ideas.

the present paper is a step in this direction. building on the results of
[16, 17, 24], we discuss the extension of the supergravity lagrangeans necessary
to include non-linear internal gauge symmetries. we describe how the non-linear
transformations can be modied to assign arbitrary u(1) charges to supermul-
tiplets in any representation of the internal gauge group, and we discuss the
cancellation of anomalies.

this paper is composed as follows. the main aspects of gauged supersym-
metric -models on kahler manifolds are reviewed in section 2. we discuss their
extension to local supersymmetry in section 3. this includes a description of the
role of the non-linear compensating scalar multiplet introduced in [15]. section 4
analyses the phenomenology in supergravity of models where the kahler potential
transforms covariantly. in section 5 the various constructions are applied in the
context of the grassmannian coset spaces u(n + m)/u(n)  u(m) and its non-
compact analogs. an anomaly-free supersymmetric model of a family of quarks
and leptons in representations of su(5)/su(3)  su(2)  u(1) is presented in
sect.6. diagonalization of the metric and propagators is discussed in a general
geometrical setting in section 7, using some of the geometrical constructions pre-
sented in the appendix. its implementation in the case of grassmannian models
is given in section 8. the vacuum conguration of the grassmannian model based
on su(5) with the standard model particle spectrum is analysed. the conclu-
sions and lessons drawn from these investigations are summarized in section 10.
their applications to other models are described in a separate publication [18].

2 supersymmetric lagrangeans

in this section we present the machinery to describe n = 1 supersymmetric
lagrangeans [23, 1, 2, 3]. the geometrical objects we use in this section are just
short-hand to cast the formulae in a more systematic form. the geometrical
aspects are of use later on in this article. all the supersymmetric eld theories
which are developed in this section have to be interpreted as eective eld theories
involving a cut-o scale f 1. this cut-o scale is used explicitly only when needed
to give a certain object its canonical dimension.

let a = (z a, a

l , h a) be a set of chiral multiplets, where z a is a physical
complex scalar, a
l a chiral fermion and h a is an auxiliary complex scalar. the
index a enumerates the multiplets in the set. the kinetic part of the lagrangean
for such chiral multiplets is given in terms of a real composite supereld k( , )
by the following supersymmetric expression

lk = k( , )|d = gaa (cid:18) z az a + a

the complex hermitean metric gaa can be derived from the kahler potential
k( z, z) by

gaa = k,aa.

(2.3)

the complex connections. the four-fermion terms have been rewritten with the
help of the curvature tensor

raabb = gaa,bb  gac,a gcc gcb,b.

(2.4)

in addition one can write down a lagrangean determined by a holomorphic func-
tion w , called the superpotential, of chiral superelds

lw = [w ()]f =

(2.5)

it follows from the lagrangean (2.1) that the symmetries of this supersymmetric
model are given by the isometries of the metric gaa which leave (2.5) invariant1.
1in fact w may transform with a phase factor which does not depend on the elds, which can
be compensated by a chiral rotation of the fermions to leave the yukawa couplings invariant.
this so-called r-symmetry is broken if the superpotential does not transform homogeneously.

ij k of a group with

the kahler potential k may transform under the isometries (2.6) as

i + k,a ra

i = fi(z) + fi( z).

ik( z, z) = k,ara

(2.8)
the functions fi( fi) are (anti-)holomorphic functions, as the metric is dened
by (2.2). by using the group property of the isometries and the fact that fi and
ri are both holomorphic, it follows that the functions fi have to transform in
the adjoint representation up to some imaginary constants: [ifj] = f k
ij fk + iaij
where the constants aij are real and anti-symmetric. by an appropriate shift of
the functions fi these constants can be absorbed in the denition of fi and one
obtains

[ifj] = f k

ij fk.

(2.9)

if the ricci tensor raa is proportional to the metric raa = f 2gaa, the kahler
potential can be written as k = f 2 ln det g and the holomorphic functions are
given by fi = f 2ra
i,a.

dening the killing potentials mi( z, z) as

imi  k,ara

i  fi(cid:17) ,
with the second identity following from eq.(2.8), one observes that the killing
potentials mi are real functions. the killing vectors ra
i can be obtained from
them by

i  fi = (cid:16)k,a ra

(2.10)

imi,a = gaara
i ,

imi,a = gaa ra
i .

they transform under the isometries in the adjoint representation

[imj] = f k

ij mk.

(2.11)

(2.12)

when the isometry group is semi-simple, all geometrical objects of the kahler
manifold can be expressed in terms of killing potentials [19, 20].

if part of the internal symmetries are local, the partial derivatives in eq.(2.1)
and in the kahler covariant derivative d have to be replaced by gauge covariant
ones given by

 we are obliged to incorporate them in vector
multiplets v i = (ai
, i, di). the gauginos i are majorana fermions, and di are
real auxiliary elds. the kinetic terms for these vector multiplets can be written
as [16, 17]

example of the function fij is fij(z) = ij where ij is the killing metric dened

and  is a complex constant. the indices i, j, . . . run over the gauged part of
the isometries and ij is the killing metric normalized by the casimir ca of the
adjoint. when a direct product group of subgroups is gauged, there are as many
dierent constants (i) as there are subgroups. the real parts of the constants:
re (ca(i)), can be interpreted as 1/(g(i))2 where g(i) are coupling constants.

for non-zero fi(z) a non-trivial function fij(z) is given by

fij(z) = (z)ij + (z)fi(z)fj(z),

(2.16)

where the coecient functions (z) and (z) must be scalars under the inter-
nal symmetries. the inverse of fij can be obtained if the killing metric ij is
invertable and ,  + (fk)2 6= 0.

(2.17)

after the introduction of the gauge elds in the lagrangean (2.1) via the covari-
ant derivatives (2.13), the -model itself is not invariant under supersymmetry
transformations anymore. this is resolved by adding the terms

until now we treated all chiral multiplets a = (cid:16), a(cid:17) on the same footing;
we now classify the chiral multiplets  and a by their transformation proper-
l, h) transforming
ties under the isometries. the chiral multiplets  = (z, 
non-linearly into themselves under a part of the isometries are called -model
l, f a(cid:17) transforming linearly into

multiplets. the chiral multiplets a = (cid:16)xa, a

themselves under all isometries, but possibly with -model-eld dependent pa-
rameters, are called matter multiplets. the transformations eq.(2.6) of -model
and matter multiplets take the form

i = r

ia = ra

(2.19)

notice that the chiral matter fermions a
l do not transform into themselves if the
transformations ra

fermions are redened such that they transform covariantly, see eq. (7.14) in that
section.

6

below we give a number of examples of matter multiplets and construct their
kahler potentials. because the transformation rules for the complex matter
scalars xa are linear in themselves, it follows that kahler potentials for the mat-
ter multiplets are invariant unless the kahler potential is a sum of a holomorphic
functions of these matter elds and its conjugate already2.
given the killing vectors r
i , the kahler potential k and hence the metric g 
for the -model multiplets, it is straightforward to give explicit examples of the
transformations of matter multiplets. by noticing that the metric g denes an
invariant line element on the kahler manifold by ds2 = dzg dz, it follows
that the scalar elds x which transform as a dierentials

ix = r

i,(z)x,

have an invariant kahler potential given by

k1(x, x; z, z) = xg x.

(2.22)

(2.23)

with the subscript 1 we indicate that this is the coupling of a rank one tensor (a
vector) to the -model. the complex scalar x can be part of a chiral multiplet
l, f ). its transformation rules are given by equations (2.21) when
 = (x, 
a, b are replaced by , . by taking tensor products of n such vectors one
can built a rank n tensor chiral multiplet which is coupled to the -model. it
is possible to construct irreducible representations of the linear isometries by
(anti)-symmetrizations and by taking traces. this construction is called covariant
matter coupling [21, 22, 15].

it is also possible to couple a scalar chiral multiplet  = (s, l, f) non-trivially

to a -model [15]. the scalar chiral multiplet  transforms as

i = f 2fi().

(2.24)

which forms a representation, see eq.(2.9). note, that as the matter elds trans-
form linearly into themselves, we have fi(, ) = fi(). we have taken the
scalar component  dimensionless, as is convenient for the applications of 
later. a covariant kahler potential for this singlet multiplet  is given by

k = f 2 ln(cid:16) (cid:17) ,

(2.25)

which transforms opposite to the kahler potential k of the -model elds. the
components of the multiplet  are non-propagating, as k is a sum of a holomor-
phic and an anti-holomorphic function. one can use this compensating multiplet
 to rescale other matter multiplets so as assign arbitrary u(1) charges q(a) to
them [15]. indeed, let a be a set of matter multiplets described by a kahler po-
tential  ag aaa. dene the rescaled multiplets a by a = q(a)a. their
transformation rules become

ia = ra

i b()b + q(a)f 2fi()a

(2.26)

2of this trivial fact we make use later, see eq.(2.25)

7

and their kahler potential has to be modied to

 ag

aaa =  ag aaaeq(a)f 2kcov.

(2.27)

the kahler potential kcov denotes any kahler potential transforming in the same
way as k. the case where kcov = k was discussed in ref.[15]. the numbers
q(a) are arbitrary real numbers and may be xed by dynamical considerations,
like anomaly cancellation3 [15].

we nish this section by xing the notation for the general considerations
below. in the following we denote the kahler potential for all physical -model
multiplets  by k( , ), and the kahler potential for all physical matter multi-
plets a by km( , ; , ). the matter elds a residing in km may be rescaled
by some power of . k = k + km is the sum of these two kahler potentials.

in the discussion of superpotentials (2.5), it is often convenient to introduce
a compensating superpotential w(): a dimensionless composite chiral supereld
which transforms as iw = qf 2fiw under the internal symmetries, with q a real
number4. with such a holomorphic function w, an invariant kahler potential
can be dened in terms of the physical elds only

k( , ) = k( , ) 

1
qf 2 ln|w()|2.

here the covariant superpotential w is dened by
w() = w()f 3w (),

(2.28)

(2.29)

combining the invariant superpotential w , as in eq. (2.5), with the compensating
superpotential w introduced above. observe, that with a compensating singlet
 one can not make more general superpotentials than with physical multiplets
alone, as  can always be integrated out.

3 non-linear chiral multiplet coupled to super-

gravity

we now turn to the coupling of gauged chiral multiplets to supergravity, as dis-
cussed for example in [16, 17], generalized to include (holomorphic) non-linear
gauge transformations. this coupling to supergravity has also been discussed in
[24] using the superspace formalism [25]. a related approach using kahler super-
space [26] can be found in [27]. besides presenting a review of this coupling, the

3 this works because one can dene covariant matter fermions a

l using (7.14) transforming

as i a

l , as we show in section 7.

l = ra

i b a

4 such a compensating superpotential w can always be constructed: for instance add two
physical singlets s+ and s with opposite charge to cancel any anomalies, and consider w =
f s+.

8

main purpose of this section is to relate it to the rescaling of the matter multi-
plets we discussed in the previous section. we make the same distinction between
-model multiplets  and matter multiplets a as in section 2. of the latter
the compensating singlet  plays a crucial role in the locally supersymmetric
case as well. the matter elds a are initially assumed to transform covariantly;
rescalings by powers of  come out naturally, as we show below. as was discussed
in ref. [16] an elegant way of coupling chiral multiplets to supergravity goes as
follows: rst couple the chiral multiplets to superconformal gravity, using a com-
pensating multiplet . by xing a set of gauges involving this compensating
chiral multiplet  the superconformal algebra is reduced to the super-poincare
algebra. on a chiral multiplet  = (z, l, h)  {, a, } the local supercon-
formal algebra with transformations  = q() + s() + d() + a() is realized
by

z = rl + (  i
l = 1

here (, ) are the parameters of local scale and chiral u(1) transformations,
whilst the spinors (, ) parameterize local q- and s-supersymmetry transfor-
mations, respectively. furthermore  = ((), (a)) denote the weyl-weights of
the chiral multiplets; the weyl-weight of  is taken to be () = 1. the special
conformal boosts do not have to be considered here as their only role is to x
the weyl gauge eld b to zero when we restrict to poincare supergravity. the
covariant derivatives are superconformal derivatives with the non-linear gauge-
covariantizations (2.13) included.

under the internal symmetries the -model elds  and the matter elds a
transform according to eqs. (2.19). generically this requires the conformal weyl
weights of the -model bosons to vanish; formally this is derived by requiring the
internal symmetries and the space-time symmetries to commute:

0 = [d, i]z = ()r

i,z  ()r

i  () = 0,.

(3.2)

furthermore, the weyl weights of the matter multiplets in a single irreducible
representation must all be equal. we can make them vanish as well by multiplying
with an appropriate power of the compensator:

a = (a)

a   (a) = 0.

(3.3)

clearly, the dimension of the physical elds (as opposed to the weyl weight)
is kept xed by taking  dimensionless. for later use in constructing invariant

9

actions we demand that the compensating singlet  transforms like a non-trivial
singlet (2.24) under the internal symmetries as

i = 2fi(),

(3.4)

with fi() now having vanishing weyl weight: (fi) = 0, but mass-dimension
dim[fi] = 2, like the kahler potential itself. by eq.(2.24) this then implies that
the multiplet a transforms under the internal symmetries as

ia = ra

i b()b + (a)2fi()a.

(3.5)

which is precisely the form of equation (2.26) with q(a)f 2 = (a)2. these charges
were introduced more or less ad hoc in ref.[15], so as to cancel anomalies. from
now on we assume that we have performed this rescaling to all the matter elds,
therefore we drop the prime on the matter elds.

with these results in mind we proceed in the standard way [16, 17] to con-
struct invariant functions of the superelds and use the density formula for real
superelds of weyl-weight 2 and chiral superelds of weyl-weight 3 to obtain
superconformally invariant lagrangeans. let k be the kahler potential for the
-model elds  and the matter elds a which is covariant

ik = fi + fi.

one denes a dimensionless invariant kahler potential g by

eg =  e2 k( , ;,).

(3.6)

(3.7)

eg is a real supereld with weyl-weight 2 and is inert under all internal symme-
tries. hence by using the density formula for a real weyl-weight 2 supereld it
follows that the lagrangean hegid
is invariant under super-
conformal and internal symmetries. for similar reasons the only weyl-weight 3
f -term lagrangean one can write down is h()3w 3/(, )if
where the covariant
superpotential w is a dimensionless holomorphic function of  and a. this la-
grangean is inert under the internal symmetries provided that the superpotential
transforms as

= h  e2k( , ,,)id

iw(, ) = 2 fi()w(, ),

(3.8)

again with the weyl weight and rescaling charge q of eq. (2.28) related by qf 2 =
2. the particular power 3/ of the superpotential w is required precisely to
satisfy this transformation rule. by redening the compensating multiplet as

 = w 1/(, ),

(3.9)

it is inert under all internal symmetries and the superpotential can be absorbed
into the extended kahler potential k [16]

eg =  e2k,

10

(3.10)

where k is given by eq. (2.28) with the above substitution qf 2  2. there-
fore a superpotential for the physical elds necessarily transforms as in eq.(3.8).
from now on we use the redened singlet  of eq.(3.9), unless explicitly stated
otherwise; therefore we drop the primes on . although we now consider non-
linear internal symmetries the kahler potential k takes the same form as given
in ref.[16]. but because of this non-linear nature, the gauging of part of the in-
ternal symmetries leads to some modications of the invariant lagrangean. these
modications only come from the d-terms and gaugino-matter coupling which
we discuss below5. the crucial part of the lagrangean in eq. (3.14) of ref.[16]

i = 0 since the compensating multiplet  does not transform under the internal
symmetries. these killing vectors can be obtained from killing potentials mi
dened by i2mi = (cid:16)eg(cid:17),a ra
i , using (2.11) and the vanishing of fi, as g is inert
under the internal symmetries. this holds for the kahler potential k as well,
and the killing potential can be expressed as

mi = egmi = eg (cid:18)mi + ikm,a(cid:26)ra

i b + (a)fia

b(cid:27)b(cid:19) .

(3.12)

the part of the lagrangean (3.11) can be written in terms of killing potentials as

tries with matter couplings is given by

l =

1
3 [3]f + [fijw iw j]f .

(3.14)

to reduce the lagrangean (3.14) to poincare supergravity with matter coupled
to it, one has to perform a number of gauge-xings [16]. this can be done in a
clever way [17] by choosing

we now briey review the relationship between this setup and the formulation
of refs. [24, 26]. if one does not perform the redenition (3.9) the superconformal
lagrangean reads

l =

1
3 [3w 3/]f + [fijw iw j]f .

(3.16)

it is inert under all internal symmetries provided that the compensator  trans-
forms according to eq. (3.4). if one reduces to poincare supergravity by applying
the gauge xings (3.15) with k replaced by k the results of refs. [24] are ob-
tained. the gauge xings eq. (3.15) in this situation are not invariant under the
internal symmetry transformations; this can be compensated by a chiral rotation
[24]

i = i

imfi5,

(3.17)

on all spinors . one could also consider arbitrary holomorphic functions f
in eqs. (3.6) and (3.4) instead of the functions fi, which are dictated by the
isometries (2.19). this is the basis of kahler superspace [26] where the kahler
u(1) transformations are gauged. notice that the redenition of the compensator
(3.9) is a special case of this. it is clear that the lagrangean (3.16) is invariant
under these transformations. this reects the fact that in supergravity the kahler
potential k and the superpotential w are not independent.
in this article our primary concerns are the isometries of the -model and
the holomorphic functions fi they induce. therefore we choose to work with the
invariant kahler potential k and the lagrangean (3.14), amounting to a specic
gauge in kahler supergravity.

4 vacuum conguration

in the previous section the construction of (locally) supersymmetric lagrangeans
for -models with non-linear symmetries was discussed. we now make a rst
step in the analysis of the phenomenology of such models. the scalar potential
v is given here before the auxiliary elds are eliminated. this has the advantage
that breaking of supersymmetry is encoded in the vacuum expectation values (to
be denoted below by <>) of the auxiliary elds: supersymmetry is broken i
at least one auxiliary eld has a non-vanishing vev. we do not consider any
fermion condensates here. combining the results of eqs. (2.1), (2.5) and (3.13),
the scalar potential for the auxiliary and physical scalars in poincare supergravity

12

reads

metries of section 3. if supersymmetry is unbroken, the gravitino may still have

(4.2)

as this term, together with the negative cosmological last term of eq. (4.1), is
supersymmetric. a vanishing gravitino mass is only possible if  1
 > 0 and the
covariant superpotential vanishes in the vacuum. because of the covariance of
the superpotential w the gravitino mass is linked to the breaking of internal
symmetries, as

< iw >= qf 2 < fi >< w > .

(4.3)

if < w >6= 0, the symmetries for which < fi >6= 0 are broken. in particular the
u(1)-factor of the linear isometries produces a constant function fu (1) = f 2a,
hence this u(1) is broken as soon as < w >6= 0. observe that the inverse is
not necessarily true: when the gravitino mass vanishes (< w >= 0) symmetry
breaking is not automatically ruled out.
in the absence of fermion condensates the equations of motion of the auxiliary

elds in the vacuum are

(4.5)

with di and h a the solutions (4.4). using eqs. (4.4) and (4.5) the following
phenomenological picture emerges. first of all observe that if

2
qf 2 = 

1




< 1

(w,a 6= 0)

(4.6)

13

the scalar potential diverges for w = 0 unless for all a the rst derivative of the
superpotential vanishes as well. in that case the scalar potential still diverges if

1




< 0

(w,a = 0).

(4.7)

in this case the scalar potential can diverge to  innity depending on the details
of the kahler potential. (in the case where not all w,a = 0 the potential always
diverges to + innity, as |w,a|2 is always positive in that situation.)
we now discuss the consequences of the analysis above. if  1
 > 1, the -
model cut-o is in general bigger than the planck-scale. in this case < w >= 0
but the derivatives of w do not have to vanish. the condition < w >= 0 may
give rise to additional internal symmetry breaking. in the situation 1   1
 > 0
the planck scale may be much bigger than the -scale, and not only < w >= 0
but also all < w,a >= 0. this means that there are more restrictions on the
vevs of the scalars and hence there may be more symmetry breaking and/or
more parameters are xed. in this case all the auxiliary elds (4.4) of the chi-
ral multiplets vanish, therefore f -term supersymmetry breaking is not possible.
the spontaneous supersymmetry breaking can therefore only occur if the aux-
iliary d-elds (4.4) acquire non-vanishing vevs. soft supersymmetry breaking
masses can still arise because of non-renormalizable contributions. we show how
this works out in practice in section (9), where the vacuum conguration of a
grassmann -model with a standard model-like spectrum is discussed.

5 grassmannian manifolds

in this section we illustrate the general constructions discussed above with grass-
mannian manifolds. with the example of a model decribing quark doublets we
show that anomaly cancellation is possible when we extend it to a non-linear ver-
sion of the standard model. a grassmannian manifold is a homogeneous space
which is obtained as the coset u(m, n)/u(m)  u(n)  su(m, n)/su(m) 
su(n)  u(1). the parameter  distinguishes the compact and non-compact
case: the compact group (s)u(m + n) has  = 1 and the non-compact group
(s)u(m, n) has  = 1. note that the second expression g/h for the coset
manifold is obtained from the rst one by cancelling a u(1) factor between the
numerator and the denominator. this u(1) may still act on the elds in our
models, where it then represents a central charge (it commutes with all genera-
tors of g). refs. [1, 2, 3] provide the kahler potential for these models, which
can be written as

k( q, q) =

(5.1)

(5.2)

here f is the parameter with the dimension of inverse mass setting the scale; it
gives the elds q their canonical dimension. two traces have been introduced:
trm acts on m  m-matrices and trn on n  n-matrices. the supereld matrix
q = (qia) has vector indices in both su(m) and su(n) and q = ( qai) is its
conjugate. we take the indices i = 1, . . . , m and a = 1, . . . n. in subsection 6
we interpret qia as a chiral multiplet containing a quark-doublet. the two real
constants a and b obey a + b = 1 and hence drop out of (5.1) after evaluating
the traces. the constant c dened by mnc = ma  nb, which may be used to
characterize the central charge, is therefore not xed uniquely. the non-linear
realization of the u(m, n) algebra on multiplets q and q takes the form

q = r(q) = 1

 q = r( q) = 1

f  + f qq + imq  iqn + i(m + n)y q,
f  + f q q + in q  i qm  i(m + n)y q,

(5.3)

where m is an element of su(m), n of su(n),  is an m n-matrix,  an n m-
matrix and y is a real number. we also introduce a real parameter c for the
central charge, but by construction the goldstone elds q, q are inert under the
central u(1). the lie algebra corresponding to the tranformation rules (5.3) can
be stated as

[y, x ia] = (m + n)x ia,

where u, v, x, x, y are the generators of su(m, n). by adding the generator c
for the central u(1) we complete this to a full set of generators for u(m, n). the
u and v are taken anti-hermitean and x and x are each others hermitean con-
jugates. the generators u i
j span the subalgebra su(m) of u(m, n) and similarly
the generators v a
b span the subalgebra su(n). the two u(1)-factors in u(m)
and u(n) combine to form the charges y and c. on qia the generators u (v)
act via left (right) multiplication. for this reason the commutators involving v
dier from the commutators involving u by a minus sign. (by a redenition of
v this minus sign could be absorbed.) the inverse metrics (5.2) transform under
these symmetries as

g1 = hg1 + g1h ,

g1 = g1 h + h g.

(5.5)

15

here the holomorphic matrix-valued functions

h = f q + im + iny + ic,

h = f q  in + imy  ic.

(5.6)

and their conjugates transform in the adjoint representation of u(m, n). using
(5.5) it is easy to show that k in eq.(5.1) transforms as a kahler potential

k( q, q) = f (q) + f (q).

(5.7)

as the functions h and h transform in the adjoint representation, so does the
holomorphic function

f (q) =

1

f 2 (cid:16)atrmh + btrn h(cid:17) =

1
f 2 (f trm(q) + imny + imncc) .

(5.8)

next we discuss matter coupling to the grassmannian model. let r( , )
and r( , ) be m  m-, resp. n  n-matrix-valued composite real superelds.
they are called left, resp. right, covariant if they transform as

r = hr + rh ,

 r = r h + h  r

(5.9)

under the u(m, n) isometries of the grassmannian manifold. invariant kahler
potentials for these real composite superelds r and r are provided by

trm(gr),

trn(g r).

(5.10)

by eqs.(5.5) it follows that g1, resp. g1, are left, resp. right, covariant but the
construction mentioned above gives trivial results for these examples. to obtain
non-trivial results, consider the chiral multiplets li and da which transform
under u(m, n) by left, resp. right, multiplication

l =hl = (f q + im + iny + ic)l,

d = d h = d(f q  in + imy  ic).

(5.11)

we will later interpret l and d as chiral superelds containing the left-handed
lepton doublets and charge conjugate of the right-handed d-quark. it follows that
l has a y charge n and central c charge 1 and d has y charge m and central c
charge 1. however this interpretation does not work directly as the y charges of
l and d with respect to q are not right to identify it with the hyper charge yw.
notice that (l l)j
a are left, resp. right, covariant composite superelds
and hence from the expressions (5.10) the kahler invariants can be constructed

i and ( dd)b

lgl

and

dg d.

(5.12)

16

by taking tensor products of multiplets which transform like l and d, one can
obtain higher rank u(m)  u(n) tensors chiral multiplets.
as the function f , see eq.(5.8), transforms in the adjoint representation, we
can use (2.24) to couple a multiplet  which is a singlet under the semi-simple
part of the unbroken symmetries to a grassmannian manifold by

 = f 2f (q) =

1
f 2 (f trm(q) + imny + imncc ) .

(5.13)

for later convenience, we take  dimensionless. the rescalings with this singlet
changes the y charge as well as the central charge c. notice that we can introduce
another singlet  with the same transformation rules as  but with a dierent
value for the central charge c, as the choice of parameters a and b in eq.(5.1) is
not unique. therefore we can dene two independent non-trivial singlets y and
c which transform as

y = (f trm(q) + imny ) y ,

c = imncc,

(5.14)

where we set the central charge of c to unity. when rescalings with y are
performed, one needs to modify the metrics (5.2) because this rescaling also
generates additional non-linear transformations. for rescalings with c this is
not the case; it can in principle be applied to all multiplets.
in the following
we discuss the eects of rescalings on matter with a general singlet  only, as
rescalings with y or c are just particular examples of this.

any given chiral multiplet, for example l, can be rescaled by such a (non-

physical) singlet  to l = ll, which transform as

l = (cid:16)l f 2f + h(cid:17) l

(5.15)

using the transformation (5.13) of the singlet . in this way the right charges
can be assigned to multiplets allowing for specic physical applications. the
additional terms in the transformation rule for l have to be compensated in the
kahler potential. again let r( , ) and r( , ) be left and right covariant real
composite multiplets. a left covariant composite real supereld is constructed
for l by

detlar detlb r l l = el(atrm ln r+btrn ln r) l l

(5.16)

and hence using (5.10) a kahler invariant for l is obtained. notice that this is an
example of eq. (2.27) with kcov = atrm ln r + btrn ln r. if one takes g1 and g1
for the composite superelds r and r then one obtains from this construction
the invariant

lgl elf 2k

17

(5.17)

by eq.(5.1). of course a similar construction works for d as well. after rescaling
l by l and d by d such that:

l = (h + lf 2f )l,

d = d( h + df 2f ),

(5.18)

the generalizations of the kahler invariants (5.12) are given by

kl = lg(l)l,

kd = dg(d) d,

with the modied metrics

g(l) = elf 2k g,

g(d) = edf 2k g.

(5.19)

(5.20)

if part of the isometries are gauged we need to introduce gauge multiplets. the
kinetic part of the lagrangean of gauge multiplets involves holomorphic functions
fij of the chiral superelds, see eq.(2.14). these functions depends in general on
the killing metric ij. as as indicated by eq.(2.16), an non-trivial example is
obtained by

fij = ij + 

(m + n)2

mn

(f 2fi)(f 2fj),

(5.21)

using the killing metric ij and the functions fi. for later convenience  has be
redened such that it is dimensionless and a group theoretical factor is taken out.
in the case of grassmannian manifolds studied in this section these functions fi
can be read o from eq.(5.8).

the killing metric ij is obtained as the special case where  = 1 and  = 0. the
gauge kinetic function fij determines which internal symmetries can be gauged:
the kinetic terms of the gauge elds have to be positive denite. in particular we
will see that although the central charge c has vanishing killing metric entries
(ic = 0), it can still be gauged if this requirement is fullled for c.

we now discuss under which conditions some or all internal symmetries may
be gauged. the results of our analysis are summarized in tabel 2. gauging of

table 1: this table gives the restrictions on the real parts of the parameters ,
 and c to allow for consistent gauging of part of the symmetries of u(m, n).

a set of generators is allowed if the following conditions are satised. first of
all the real part of the gauge kinetic function refij restricted to the gauged
generators has to be positive denite6. secondly, the gauge algebra must close:
all commutators of gauged generators can be written as a linear combination of
gauged generators. and nally the gauged symmetries have to be anomaly free. a
few remarks about these conditions are in order. the second condition is trivially
satsied if part of the linear subgroup is gauged. however when the generators
x and x are gauged, the generators y , u and v have to be gauged as well.
the other remark concerns anomalies. anomalies in su(m, n) are not allowed
even when these symmetries are global since these anomalies make a consistent
quantization of the (s)u(m, n)/s[u(m) u(n)] impossible [11]. the cancelation
of these anomalies can be done by coupling additional matter to the coset. this is
illustrated in the next subsection where we discuss a consistent model of the coset
su(5)/su(2)u(1)su(3). of course, once these anomalies have been canceled
there is no danger in gauging the corresponding isometries. the global central
charge c symmetry may be anomalous since it does not aect the quantization
of the -model. of course c can only be gauged if the c anomaly is vanishes as
well.

let us rst consider the gauging of the linear parts of u(m, n). the su(m)
and su(n) subgroups are gaugeable if r  re  > 0. the situation involving the
charges c and y is a bit more complicated. if y is gauged, one must have that
r + r > 0. on the other hand if only c is gauged, the condition is r > 0. both
charges can be gauged at the same time if both eigenvalues of the 2  2-matrix

rc2 r + r!
 rc2

rc2

are positive, that is r + r > rc2 > 0. this condition is stronger than the
conditions for gauging either y or c combined. for the broken generators the
analysis looks more complicated as the gauge kinetic function depends on q and
q. but if we gauge x and x we can choose the unitary gauge: q = q = 0.
6as the generators x and x are each others hermitean conjugates, ref xx has to be positive

denite.

19

therefore the broken generators may be gauged if r > 0. however as we
remarked above u, v and y have to be gauged as well, therefore only the compact
case ( = 1) can be gauged consistently.

gauging part of the isometries introduces additional terms in the scalar po-
tential as the killing potentials mi couple to the auxiliary elds di, see eq.(3.13).
the calculation ref 1 is not dicult in any of the situations mentioned in ta-
ble 1: in all cases f restricted to the gauged symmetries is block diagonal with
invertable blocks.

having discussed the form of ref 1, we turn to the killing potentials. we
denote all killing potentials mi collectively as m = imi, where i stands
for the parameters of the isometries. we rst focus on the part m of the
killing potential depending on the -model elds q and q only; afterwards the
matter contribution mm is examined. the complete killing potential is given by
m = m +mm. both the -model and matter killing potentials can be written
conveniently in terms of the matrices

 =r(ia)(cid:16)g1(cid:17),(ia)
=  ic + iy (cid:16)(m + n)f 2q qg  n(cid:17)  img

= + ic + iy (cid:16)(m + n)f 2g qq  m(cid:17) + if 2g qmq

+ ign + f (cid:16) q  q(cid:17) ,

under some mild assumptions as we see below. using eq.(2.10) for the -model
elds q and q we nd that their killing potential can be written as

im = k,(ia)r(ia) 

1
qf 2w 1w =

a

f 2 trm +

b

f 2 trn .

(5.24)

notice that w 1w plays the role of f and that the covariant superpotential w
in combination with the -model kahler potential forms an invariant. to discuss
the killing potential due to matter elds in some generality we introduce some
further notation. we discuss only the rescaled matter eld l here, as it is easy
to generalize our discussion to the matter eld d and tensor products. dene
i = (g(l) l)j li where g(l) is the
the m  m matrix real composite supereld [l l]j
rescaled metric dened in eq.(5.20). notice that [l l]g1 is a left covariant real
composite supereld, hence by (5.10) we obtain the kahler invariant: trm[l l] =
kl. from now on we assume that the matter kahler potential km can be
written entirely in terms of matrices like [l l]. as km is a scalar kahler invariant

20

function, one can dene the killing potential for the matter eld l as

iml = trm(cid:20)km,[l l](cid:18)qia(g(l)),(ia)l l + g(l)l l(cid:19)(cid:21) .

(5.25)

where km,[l l] denote the derivative of km with respect to the matrix [l l]. this
can be expressed in terms of  and m as

iml =  lkm,[l l]g(l)(cid:16)lf 2 im + (cid:17) l.

(5.26)

the killing potential mm due to all the dierent matter elds is a sum of killing
potentials like ml. as the killing potentials m, mm for the -model elds
and the matter elds are linear in  and , cf. eq.(5.24), we can always express
the full killing potential as:

im = trmp + trn  p

(5.27)

where the eld dependent matrices p and p encode the details of the full kahler
potential. using these matrices one can state the killing potentials for the dif-
ferent symmetries of u(m, n) as

+ trn p (cid:16)(m + n)f 2g qq  m(cid:17) ,

mc = trmp + trn p ,
my = trmp (cid:16)(m + n)f 2q qg  n(cid:17)
mu = gp + f 2q p g q,
mv = p g  f 2 qgp q,
imx = f (cid:16) qgp + p g q(cid:17) ,
im x = f (cid:16)gp q + q p g(cid:17) .

(5.28)

6 grassmannian standard model

we now turn to an example illustrating how one can cancel anomalies by adding
rescaled matter multiplets. if we consider the case with m = 2 and n = 3 then the
grassmannian manifold may be the basis of an su(5) unication model with the
standard model group su(2)u(1)su(3) as the unbroken subgroup. we do not
require the u(2, 3) to be compact nor do we disregard the central charge c. in the
standard model the eld content is such that all possible anomalies cancel in each
generation, consisting of a quark doublet ql, a lepton doublet ll, quark singlets dc
l
and uc
l. (the notions singlet and doublet here refer to
su(2) representations.) if one wants to consider models with more generations,
the simplest thing is just to take a number of copies of this structure. only in

the canonical charge of the  model and yw denotes the hyper charge needed for
anomaly cancelation within the standard model. these charges can be indentied
if y = 15yw. the number k gives the rescalings with a singlet y . c is the
central charge, which can be chosen dierently for each (matter) multiplet, using
the singlet c.

the quark doublet sector there will be a dierence: an additional quark doublet
q is to be coupled covariantly to the -model spanned by q. we do not pursue
multiple generation models here further. finally we introduce a higgs sector
consisting of two su(2) doublets h  with opposite charge. the introduction of
the higgses is necessary for the breaking of su(2)  uy (1) to uem(1).
the hyper charges in the standard model are assigned so as to produce
anomaly cancelation.
in the supersymmetric models the chiral fermion repre-
senations have to be completed to the chiral supermultiplets qia, li, da, u a, h 
and e. however if we use the standard coupling of matter multiplets to the
grassmann -model we do not obtain the correct charge assignment.

in table 2 the hyper charge yw for the chiral multiplets containing the quarks
and leptons is compared to the canonical charge y dened on the grassmannian
manifold, as e.g. obtained from the couplings in eqs. (5.3) and (5.11). in the third
column we have evaluated these u(1) charges in the case of u(2, 3) (su(5)). in
the fourth column we have given the central charges c of the multiplets. as
is obvious from this table the hyper charges yw required in the standard model
do not match the charges y . (for this to happen, we should have y = 15yw
for all elds.) however from eq.(5.13) we see that the singlet chiral multiplet
y has u(1) charge mn = 6 in the u(2, 3) model. by employing the rescaling:
(k) = k
y  any chiral multiplet  can be given an additional charge k mn. in
the last column we have given the powers (l, d, u, e, h) to which the singlet has
to be raised in order the nd the right hyper charge assignment for the standard
model. in a similar way the central charges c may be ajusted to coincide with

22

the b  l quantum numbers.
multiplets as given in this table and hence we can state the kahler potential.

in the following we assume that we have performed the rescaling to the chiral

k = k + ke + kl + kd + ku + kh + + kh ,

(6.1)

where kl and kd are dened in eqs.(5.19) and ke, kh  and ku are dened in
a similar fashion.

as fundamental compensating superpotentials we may take

we = f e

(qe = e = 5),

wl = f 2ijlih j

(ql = 1 + l + h = 5).

(6.2)

using the su(2) invariant -tensor, it follows that wl is a su(2) singlet. these
compensating superpotentials transform as w = qf 2f w where the numbers
q is given in the brackets in (6.2). the central charge cw of the compensating
superpotential determines the central charge of the holomorphic functions into
which the kahler potential transforms: qmnc = cw. combining these compen-
sating superpotentials to another superpotential puts restrictions on the choice
of c-charges of the superpotentials (6.2). for example

w = awe + b(wl)1,

(6.3)

where a and b are complex constants, demands that cwe = cwl. this in turn
puts restrictions on the c-charges of the matter elds.
for the invariant superpotential w we take a part of the standard model

superpotential:

w =  + eijh ilj  ijh +ih j.

(6.4)

the rst term  is a constant with dimension of (mass)3; the second term is
the usual yukawa coupling in supersymmetric models and the third term is the
higgs interaction. notice that in this model there are no yukawa interations for
the quarks, as the quark doublet supereld q does not transform covariantly.
notice that the superpotential w has a homogeneously vanishing central charge
if ce + cl + c = 0 and c+ + c = 0. also notice that these central charges can
be choosen in accordance with the lepton number l. in that case we can take
c+ = c = 0 and ce = cl = 1. the central charges of the quark multiplets (q,
d, u) can be chosen to match the baryon number.

7 separation of submanifolds

if one considers the combined system of a non-linear -model with additional
matter coupling to it, the metric of that total system is in general not diagonal:

23

one can have mixing between dierent representations of the symmetry algebra in
the quadratic kinetic terms of the scalars and chiral fermions. this is carried over
to the denition of propagators. if one knows that the theory is constructed out of
several sectors, one would like to be able to assign to each sector a separate metric,
without mixing between dierent sectors. this requires the metric to be block
diagonal, with each block representing the metric of a dierent representation of
the isometry group. with the machinery developed in the appendix this can be
done elegantly without too much computational diculty.

we consider a kahler manifold parametrized by the coordinates z a = (z, xa)
and their conjugates. the method we follow generalizes the result of ref. [28]
where only quadratically coupled rank 1 matter was considered:km = xagaaxa,
with the metric gaa depending on z and z. however, the starting point of
this section is more general, allowing any kahler potential k of the -model and
matter elds. first we identify the -model kahler potential k(z, z) and the
matter kahler potential km(x, x; z, z) by

k = k|x=x=0 ,

km  gxx = k  k.

(7.1)

the notation gxx for the matter kahler potential is very suggestive as it reduces
to gxx = xagaaxa when matter is quadratically coupled. to take this anology to
the case of quadratic matter coupling a bit further, we dene

gxa = k,a,

gax = k,a,

whilst the metrics for the matter and -model elds are

gaa  k,aa,

g   k,.

(7.2)

(7.3)

to be able to use the method explained in the appendix, we rst need to
dene the non-holomorphic transformation matrices x a
a . we do this by
demanding that the transformations (a.5) matrices block-diagonalize the metric
of the combined system of -model elds and matter and leave the metric for the
matter elds unchanged. the metric of the combined system is

a and x a

gaa ! ,
gaa =  g  + gxx, gxa,

gax,

(7.4)

where g  is the metric of the -model without matter coupling. then the
appropriate transformation is given by the matrices

used the generalized curvature rxx dened by

rxx  gxx,  gxb,gbbgbx, = gxx,  b

x.

(7.9)

in the following we also assume that the metric (7.7) is invertable. notice that
the inverse of this transformation is given by the same matrices (7.5) but the
primed-indices now are downstairs and there is an additional minus-sign in front
of the o-diagonal parts.

we could also have chosen the matrices (7.5) dierently to block diagonalize
the total metric (for example use an upper triangle matrix for the rst one) but
as the metric g was already modied (see eq. (7.4)), it is most convenient to
include all the other modications in there as well. they can all be combined
simply in the curvature (7.9).

using the connections (7.6) one can dene quite a number of generalized

curvature components

25

let us mention an important application of the transformation diagonaliz-
ing the metric to eq. (7.7). for several physical applications, like determining
whether there is soft supersymmetry breaking, one needs to know the contracted
ba and the ricci-tensor raa = gbbrbbaa of the full model. in
connection a = b
particular the calculation of the curvature can be very tedious even in the setup
presented here, and it is hard to obtain the ricci tensor in this way. however it is
well known that the contracted connection and the ricci tensor can be obtained
from the determinant det g of the metric

a = (ln det g),a,

raa = (ln det g),aa.

(7.11)

as the transformation matrices (7.5) are upper- or lower-triangular matrices their
determinants are unity. therefore we may use the block-diagonal metric (7.7) to
calculated the determinant of the full metric: det g = det g.

there are some further applications of the method discussed in the appendix.
if the transformations described by the matrices (7.5) are applied to the derivative
of the coordinates z, xa we nd that (a.4))

(z)a

dxa!

(7.12)

the derivative dxa
is covariant under holomorphic transformations. from now
on we drop the primes on the indices if no confusion is possible. using these
denitions the kinetic energy of the boson elds z and xa can be written as

lb = g zz + gaad xadxa.

l, the fermionic partner of xa, is turned into a covariant vector by

where the hat denotes covariantization.

so far we have only discussed how the metric and covariant vectors behave
under the transformations described by the matrices (7.5). this is sucient to
write the kinetic lagrangean for the complex scalars in a convenient form. we
now turn to the calculation of the kinetic lagrangean of the chiral fermions. these
terms in eq.(2.1) involve the covariant derivative on the chiral fermions of the full
sytem, so we have know the form of the covariant derivate on a covariant vector
v a. to calculate this we use eq.(a.8) of the appendix:

8 geometry of matter in grassmannian models

the previous section was devoted to the question of how one could make the
metric of the combined system of matter and -model elds block diagonal. in
doing so we noticed, that these techniques can be applied to make all kinds of
functions of elds covariant under the isometries of the underlying -model. in
this section we show how these methods may work in practice with the example
discussed in section 3 of consistent grassmann -models with the eld content of
the standard model with one generation. our starting point is the quadratically
coupled matter kahler potential (6.1). using the results of section 7 we have
computed the connections (7.6)

j (g q)bi(cid:17) ,
ak

i (g q)aj + c

(kc)
(ia)(jb) =  f 2(cid:16)c

e(jb) =  ef 2( qg)jbe,

d(jb) =  f 2(cid:16)d(g q)bjdc + c

k

j ( qgl)b(cid:17) ,
b(dg q)j(cid:17) .

(8.1)

the connection for u is similar to the one for d, and the connections for the
higgses h  are similar to the one for l. (in models with more generations, the
quark doublets q have the same connection as the -model eld q.) to make a
distinction between indices referring the original -model elds qia and matter
indices a and i, we write (ai) for the former ones. notice that the normal gauge,
in which all connections vanish, coincides with the unitary gauge q = 0. because
of the global u(2, 3) invariance, the vacuum can always be studied in the normal
gauge by setting < q >= 0. using these connections, one obtains the covariant
chiral fermions by eq. (7.14), for example

l  ec

l =ec

it turns out that it is very protable to express other quantities using the covariant
objects dened in section 7 as well. first of all we nd that the rst order
derivative of the kahler potential simplies to

k,a = (cid:16)(g q)(ai), eg(e), ( lg(l))i, ( h +g(h ))i, (g(d) d)a, (g(u ) u )a(cid:17) .

the full metric in the transformed system is given by

g = diag(cid:16)g, g(e), g(l), g(h +), g(h ), g(d), g(u )(cid:17) ,

where g is given by (8.4).

9 vacua of the grassmannian standard model

section 6 discussed a consistent grassmannian model with the fermion particle
spectrum of the standard model. we now discuss the possible vacuum congu-
rations of this model. grassmannian models with doubling have been studied in
a supergravity background [29], but they did not include superpotential terms
which may alter their claim that the fermion masses are of the order of the grav-
itino mass. using the geometrical results of section 8 we can discuss the vacuum
solutions of this model in an elegant and straightforward fashion.

before going into the details of the model we rst observe that the vacuum
can always be chosen such that < q >= 0. as the vacuum expectation values of
q and q are constants, they can be set to zero by a global gauge transformation.
notice that < q >= 0 is indeed a vacuum solution, because in the scalar potential
q and q always appear together.

in the supergravity background the consistent model of u(2, 3)/u(2) u(3)
with the chiral fermion content of the standard model should satisfy at least the
following requirements in order not contradict the standard model phenomenol-
ogy: the gauge group su(3)  uem(1) is unbroken, and the gauginos and the
complex scalar bosons should acquire masses above the scale of the gauge bosons
and the chiral fermions.

here we analyze the restrictions resulting from the electroweak symmetry
breaking. the subgroup su(3)  uy (1)  su(2) is gauged and that the gen-
erator qem = 1
2yw + i3 is unbroken. therefore all singlets under su(2) should
vanish in the vacuum; this holds in particular for the covariant superpotential w.
furthermore we demand that b  l is a good symmetry (below) the electroweak
symmetry breaking scale. only neutral parts of the higgs su(2) doublets may
acquire a vacuum expectation value

in section 4 we discussed special requirements which have to be fullled in or-
der for < w >= 0 to be allowed. we investigate the consequences of these condi-
tions. we assume that the covariant superpotential can be written as w = wf 3w,
eq. (2.28). (in general this may be a sum of these such products.) for the invari-
ant superpotential w one can take (6.4). for the compensating superpotential
w we can choose between two compensating superpotentials, see (6.2) where also
their charges can be found. because of the strong restriction that the covariant
superpotential has to vanish in the vacuum, it follows that the gravitino mass
vanishes. therefore soft supersymmetry breaking masses can only arise due to the
non-linear nature of the model. the minimal condition for which the covariant
superpotential may vanish is that

0 <

this requirement species which version of u(2, 3) one should use. the com-
pensating superpotential we is relevant in the non-compact version ( = 1) as
the charge qe is positive, to incorporate proper electroweak symmetry breaking.
however the charge of wl is negative, so it should be used in the compact ver-
sion ( = 1). when 0 <  1
  1 the derivatives of the covariant superpotential
should vanish as well.
we will now analyse the dierent cases in more detail, starting with we. in

10 conclusions

eective eld theory may serve as a powerful tool in the study of physics beyond
the standard model up to the intrinsic cut-o scale, which could be as large as
the planck scale. if the theory is realized in a broken phase, the symmetries are
non-linear. for n = 1 supersymmetric theories this involves the study of kahler
manifolds. kahlerian coset models provide a class of interesting examples, but un-
fortunately in their simplest version these models are inconsistent. until recently
the only known method to make these models consistent in a supersymmetric
way, was by doubling the spectrum by adding mirror chiral superelds. the
phenomenology of these doubling models is unsatisfactory as the fermions can
easily get masses of the cut-o scale. if a renormalizable supersymmetric eld
theory is plagued by anomalies, one adds extra matter representations with the
appropriate quantum numbers. when matter is coupled to kahler models, this
can be done similarly if the charges of the matter superelds can be manipulated
freely. in ref. [15] we showed that it was possible to do this, and construct con-
sistent supersymmetric -models without resorting to mirror chiral superelds.
the crucial step is that one can couple a singlet to the kahler manifold using the
holomorphic functions fi in which the kahler potential transforms. once it was
understood how to couple a singlet with an arbitrary u(1) charge to the -model,
the door was opened to change the charges of other matter representations as well
using rescaling of these matter elds by a non-trivial singlet.

in this article we have reviewed and extended these ideas. the holomorphic
functions fi were also used to give a non-trivial example of a gauge kinetic func-
tion. we have discussed in detail the coupling of kahler models with additional
matter to supergravity. we showed that in supergravity the rescaling of the mat-
ter elds is a consequence of their weyl-weights and the covariance of the kahler
potential. the compensating singlet of superconformal gravity can be used to
cancel the transformation of the kahler potential, before reducing it to super-
gravity. this singlet is used to set the weyl-weights of the matter elds to zero.

32

doing this introduces the same additional transformation rules for the matter
elds. because of the transformation properties of the compensating singlet in
supergravity, the superpotential has to be covariant as well. using this covariant
superpotential one can construct an invariant kahler potential. we showed that
the auxiliary elds of the gauge multiplets couple to the scalars via the killing
potentials.

the study of the vacuum congurations of these models implies that either the
kahler u(1) isometry is broken or additional requirements have to be satised.
either there is a relation between the cut-o scale f 1, the planck scale and
the transformation properties of the covariant superpotential or there are more
requirements on the vevs of the scalar elds. another consequence is that the
gravitino mass vanishes in the case of an unbroken kahler u(1).

the consistent system of -model and matter superelds can become quite
complicated. in particular the various irreducible representations have mixed ki-
netic terms as the metric is not block diagonal. by applying a non-holomorphic
transformation on covariant objects, like chiral fermions and derivatives of the
scalars, it is possible to block-diagonalize the metric. this transformation also
turns non-covariant objects, like the chiral fermions belonging to the matter sec-
tors, into covariant ones. this method is explained in section 7 and the geomet-
rical background can be found in the appendix. the automatic covarantizations
are convenient consequences of this method, but other calculations are simplied
as well.

all these dierent aspects are illustrated by the example of grassmannian
coset models u(m, n)/u(m)  u(n). the properties of matter coupling to
grassmannian kahler manifolds are described by using left- and right-covariant
real composite superelds. this oers many dierent ways to construct non-
equivalent invariant kahler potentials for the matter elds. the algebra of isome-
tries of the -models is discussed in detail, identifying the kahler u(1) charge
and a central charge. although killing metrics involving the central charge all
vanish, it still possible to gauge the central charge in some cases: by using the
holomorphic functions f , the zero-mode of the gauge kinetic functions fij can be
removed. it turned out that under mild assumptions, the killing potentials take a
very systematic form. as a practical illustration of the cancelation of the anoma-
lies in a grassmannian coset models, we discussed a model of the standard model
where the superpartner of the quark-doublet is interpreted as the coordinates of
the coset u(2, 3)/u(2)  u(3). we showed how on this kahler manifold matter
representations could be added in such a way that the chiral fermion sector of
the model coincides with the standard model. as the covariant superpotential
plays an important role in supergravity, the construction of the superpotential
was discussed in some detail. the power of the non-holomorphic transformation
on covariant objects was illustrated for the calculation of the metric and rst
derivative of the kahler potential. also we obtained the expressions for the co-
variant chiral matter fermions in this way. we showed that in supergravity the

33

grassmannian version of the standard model leads to phenomenological accept-
able results only in very specic cases. the compensating superpotential is either
wl or we, see eqs. (6.2). the former leads to two inequivalent vacua, of which
only one is acceptable, as in the other case one of the two higgses has a vanishing
vev. the covariant superpotential we also gives rise to an acceptable vacuum,
but with a dierent value for tan .

a appendix: geometry of kahler manifolds

in section 2 we review the structure of n = 1 supersymmetric models in 4 di-
mensions and come across various geometrical objects like the metric, connection
and curvature. these geometrical objects are used as convenient short-hand to
write the lagrangean in a compact form. they have very specic functions in the
supersymmetric lagrangean: the kinetic energy of the scalars and the fermions
were described by the metric. the dirac operator that acts on the chiral fermions
involved the connection and the four-fermion interactions couple via the curva-
ture after the auxiliary elds were removed, see eq.(2.1). in this appendix we look
at these objects from a geometrical point of view but keeping physical applica-
tions in mind. (section 7 discusses a few of these applications like how to dene
fermions in chiral matter multiplets in order that they transform covariantly and
how to make the metric block diagonal.) we consider a kahler manifold de-
scribed (locally) by a kahler potential k( z, z) and treat the superpartners a
l
of z a in exactly the same way as covariant elds that live on this kahler mani-
fold. various transformations that can act on covariant elds are studied in this
appendix. in section 7 these transformations are used to cast the supersymmetric
lagrangean involving matter multiplets into a form depending only on physical
covariant elds.

since a kahler manifold is complex, the coordinate transformations preserving

the complex structure are holomorphic

z a  z a
any object v a (and its conjugate v a) transforming as

z a  z a

= ra

(z),

v a  v a

v a  v a
under the holomorphic coordinate transformations with

a (z)v a,

= x a

is called a covariant vector of the kahler manifold. in the context of supersym-
metric -models many covariant vectors are encountered, to name a few: the
derivatives z a, the dierentials dz a and the superpartners a

l of z a.

34

the coordinate transformations (a.1) generally do not leave the metric of
the kahler manifold invariant, only the s-matrix of the eld theory described
by these coordinates. the coordinate transformations that do leave the metric
invariant are called isometries.

on the covariant vectors the transformation rules (a.2) we can consider more

general transformations

v a  v a

a ( z, z)v a,

(a.4)

a ( z, z) are possibly non-holomorphic functions. this type of transfor-
where x a
mations can be used to make the physical content of a eld theory more trans-
parent, as is illustrated in section 7. the rst thing to note is that these transfor-
mations can not be generated by non-holomorphic coordinates transformations
because they would introduce terms involving v a in eq.(a.4) too. therefore the
transformations (a.4) can only be dened on the level of covariant vectors and
geometrical objects like the metric: v a
is nothing but a short-hand for the ex-
a ( z, z)v a for the covariant vector v a. in the following we study
pression x a
how the transformations (a.4) change the appearance of formulae involving the
metric, connection and curvature.

if we demand that the metric denes an invariant inner product for covariant

vectors, it must transform as

gaa  g
a ( z, z) is the inverse of x a

a ( z, z).

where x a

aa = x a

a x a

a gaa

(a.5)

a word about our notation is in order here: let aa be any object with one
index down, not necessarily a vector; it may be a function of covariant vectors and
derivatives. applying (a.4) to all covariant vectors transforms aa into a
a. one
can also just contract aa with the matrix x a
a aa.
in the case of covariant vectors and the metric g
aa = gaa these two denitions
coincide but this is not true in general. (when there is no confusion possible, like
with covariant vectors or the metric, we drop the prime on the symbol itself.)
the prime example where this is not the case is the connection

a this is denoted by aa = x a

notice that the third term in equations (a.6) vanishes if the transformations are
holomorphic. here we see clearly that the connection is not a tensor even in
the case of holomorphic transformations. but this exactly enables us to dene
cbz bv c.

however it is only covariant under holomorphic transformations but not under
eq.(a.4); indeed

(a.8)

the second term on the r.h.s. follows from eq.(a.6) and the third compensates
for the fact that the ordinary derivative  within d can hit the transformation
a which may also depend on z a. the rst term on the r.h.s. is of the
matrix x a
same form as what one would get if the transformations (a.4) are holomorphic.
the last two terms involve u and u s with mixed indices indicating the non-
holomorphic nature of (a.4).

finally we investigate how the transformations (a.4) inuence the curvature.
the calculation follows the same line as above, but now it is really convenient
to separate terms which do not have mixed transformations involving u and u .
with this separation one can identify which terms behave as if the transforma-
tions (a.4) are holomorphic. we call these terms holomorphic and indicate them
with a superscript h. the remaining terms have us and us with mixed indices.
they are called non-holomorphic and are indicated by a superscript n.

since the curvature is a tensor under holomorphic transformations, the holo-
morphic part rh also transforms as a tensor under (a.4). by identifying the
holomorphic and non-holomorphic parts we nd

r

aabb = rh

ca,b + gn

(a.9)

as we already know how the holomorphic part of the curvature transforms, we
only have to consider the terms with non-holomorphic transformations. in these
terms replace the remaining holomorphic like parts gh
ac,b by (g  gn )ac,b.
(in section 7 we are not so much interested in the transformed curvature itself,
but more in having a simple way to write expressions involving the curvature,
like the four-fermion terms.) therefore we we write

r

aabb = r

aabb + g
