it is pointed out that the essential parts of some recent papers by mebarki et
al. (hep-th/9911045, hep-th/9911046, hep-th/9911048, hep-th/9911049, dated 6
nov.1999) are taken from a book written by nakanishi and ojima, published in
1990.

the following four papers, which have appeared as e-prints very recently,
have come to our attention:

[mmz] n. mebarki, a. maireche and s. zaim, n = 1, d = 4 quantum
nonsymmetric supergravity (hep-th/9911045),
[mmbb] n. mebarki, a. maireche, a. boudine and a. benslama, symmetries
of quantum nonsymmetric gravity (hep-th/9911046),
[mm] n. mebarki and a. maireche, quantum nonsymmetric gravity geo-
metric commutation relations (hep-th/9911048),
[mmh] n. mebarki, a. maireche and m. houchine, qngt sixteen dimen-
sional gl(4,r)-like superalgebra (hep-th/9911049).

taking advantage of the situation that nobody has discussed the quantum
theory of nonsymmetric gravity, these authors pretend as if all of these papers
were their original work. however, apart from some considerations at the
lagrangian level, the essential parts are taken from chapter 5 of the following
book published in 1990 with absolutely no mention to it:

[no] n. nakanishi and i. ojima, covariant operator formalism of gauge
theories and quantum gravity (world scientic, singapore, 1990).

moreover, mebarki et al. delete all the references to the original papers
on quantum einstein gravity by nakanishi (partly with some collaborators),
published in 1978-1985.

what they reproduce from the book [no] are not merely contents but also
bulk of sentences, though, of course, with straightforward modications nec-

essary for pretending as if those were their own sentences. as a result, it
becomes very easy to identify which parts are taken by them. as for [mmz]
and [mmbb], see appendix.

aside from introduction and conclusion, the whole papers of [mm] and
[mmh] are taken almost faithfully (with some portions skipped and with
some mistakes committed) from section 5.6 (pp.319-333) of [no] and from
section 5.5 (pp.312-318) of [no], respectively. mebarki et al. have copied
even simple misprints of a mathematical expression in [no], which could
easily have been corrected if they had checked mathematical formulae.

the geometric commutation relation and the sixteen dimensional super-
algebra or choral symmetry (named by nakanishi) are very remarkable re-
sults characteristic to quantum einstein gravity. to derive them, one must
make full use of the equal-time commutation relations (between eld opera-
tors and their time derivatives), whose calculations are extremely elaborate.
mebarki et al. write merely canonical commutation relations but one can nd
no evidence that they have actually calculated the equal-time commutation
relations (between eld operators and their time derivatives) of quantum
nonsymmetric gravity. these expressions must be dierent from those of
quantum einstein gravity. therefore there is no reason to believe that the
geometric commutation relation and the sixteen dimensional superalgebra
remain valid in quantum nonsymmetric gravity.

we hope that mebarki, maireche and their collaborators refrain from the

unfair conduct shameful as scientists.

 paper[mmz]:

i) p.9, line 7  p.10, line 6, is taken from p.300 (chapter 5) of [no].

ii) p.11, line 17  p. 12, line 5, is from p.340 (chapter 5) of [no].

 paper[mmbb]:

i) the opening (ten lines on p.2) is a faithful copy of the opening of chapter

5 on p.281 of [no].

one can easily nd more such as

ii) p.5, line 23  p.6, line 11, is an imitation of p.158 (chapter 3) of [no]

[with an erroneous change of conne into conrm].

iii) p.6, line 16  line 19 is taken from p.14 (chapter 1) of [no].

iv) p.7, line 9  line 13, is borrowed from p.304 (chapter 5) of [no]; as
pointed out in the text, however, it is quite unlikely that the sentence
all the equal time commutators can be obtained in closed form is
realized in the framework of quantum nonsymmetric gravity.

v) p.9, line 1  line 4, is taken from p.159 (chapter 3) of [no].
