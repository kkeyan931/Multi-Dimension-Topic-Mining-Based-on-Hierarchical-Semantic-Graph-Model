abstract

in a previous paper we provided a consistent quantization of open strings ending on
d-branes with a background b eld. in this letter, we show that the same result can also
be obtained using the more traditional method of diracs constrained quantization. we
also extend the discussion to the fermionic sector.

1 introduction

it was shown by connes, douglas and schwarz [1] that for the matrix model compactied
on a torus, the three-form c eld background should be incorporated in the supersym-
metric yang-mills theory (sym) by deforming the base space into a quantum space. due
to the correspondence between the dlcq m theory and the d-brane worldvolume eld
theory [2], this means that the d-brane eld theory lives on a noncommutative space in
the presence of a ns-ns b eld background [3, 4, 5]. in a previous paper we quantized
an open string ending on a d-brane with a constant ns-ns b eld background, and
we found that the spacetime coordinates of the open string endpoint are noncommuta-
tive. the noncommutativity precisely agrees with previous results [1], but in addition we
showed that the compactness of the torus is not necessary for the noncommutitivity, and
in general the deformation is parametrized by f = b  f instead of b.

the quantization of an open string we did in [6] was carried out explicitly in terms
of a mode expansion of the generic solution of the equations of motion for the spacetime
coordinates x . we used a heuristic argument in the derivation of commutation relations
among the mode coecients, and then check that it is a consistent quantization of the
classical theory.

in this paper we carry out the quantization again by following the standard quantiza-
tion procedure of dirac for systems with constraints. the constraints here are, of course,
the boundary conditions of the open string ending on a d-brane. we nd that there is
a single ambiguous expression which needs to be regularized. we obtain our previous
results by choosing a natural regularization. we also nd the commutation relations for
the fermionic elds using supersymmetry.

2 necessity of noncommutativity

we rst review briey the setting. consider a fundamental string ending on a dp-brane.
this can be in type ii superstring, type 0 superstring, or in the bosonic string theory. the
bosonic part of the action takes the same form [7, 8]

d2[ggx x  + bx x ] +

d ai(x) x i, (1)

1

2 i

sb =

1

4 z

where ai, i = 0, 1,    , p, is the u(1) gauge eld living on the dp-brane. we use the
convention  = diag(1, 1) and 01 = 1 as in [6]. here the string background is

g = ,  = constant, h = db = 0.

(2)

adding the fermionic sector does not aect the result and will be considered later. with
slight modication, the considerations in this paper can also be applied to study open
string ending on a d-brane in type i string theory.

2

if both ends of a string are attached to the same dp-brane, the last term in (1) can

be written as

1

4 z
furthermore, consider the case b = pp

as

d2fijx ix j.

i,j=0 bijdx idx j, then the action (1) can be written

sb = z d l =

4 z d2[gx x  + fijx ix j].

and the boundary conditions at  = 0, :

i = 0,

i, j = 0, 1,    , p,

a = p + 1,    , d.

(6)

(7)
(8)

the constraint (8) is standard. we will be mainly interested in the constraint (7). as

demonstrated in [6], the bc (7) implies that

2p k(, 0)fk

i = x j(, 0)mj

i,

where p k is the canonical momentum

2p k(, ) =  x k + x jfj

k,

and mij = ij  fi

kfkj. it follows that

2[p k(, 0), p j(, )]fk

i = [x k(, ), p j(, )]=0 mk

i,

and

2[p k(, 0), x j(, )]fk

i = [x i(, ), x j(, )]=0.

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

these simple relations show that the standard canonical commutation relations for

f = 0,

[x i(, ), pj(, )] = ii

j(, ),

[pi(, ), pj(, )] = 0,
[x i(, ), x j(, )] = 0,

3

(13)
(14)
(15)

are no longer valid when f 6= 0. they are not compatible with the boundary condition (7)
when f 6= 0. in particular, without doing any further calculations, one can see already
from (12) that the string coordinates must necessarily be noncommutative somewhere
along the string. a consistent quantization was therefore proposed in [6] and it was
shown that the canonical commutation relations are modied to

[p i(, ), p j(, )] = 0,

[x k(, ), x l(, )] = ( 2i(m 1f )kl,  =  = 0 or ,

otherwise,

0,

[x i(, ), p j(, )] = iij (, ),

(16)

(17)

(18)

where (, ) is the delta function on [0, ] with vanishing derivative at the boundary,
(, ) = 0 for  = 0, . see [6] for its explicit form. thus we see that the string
e.g. 
becomes noncommutative at the endpoint, i.e. the d-brane becomes noncommutative. it
was further shown that for the case f = b, (17) agrees with the results obtained from
other considerations [9]. the result of our quantization was later conrmed in [10] using
standard string perturbation theory.

although our quantization in [6] is entirely consistent and produces results in agree-
ment with other considerations, the argument there was mainly based on intuitive guess
and consistency argument. it may perhaps be more satisfactory to give a derivation of
that result based on more traditional method. in the next section, we will show that the
result in [6] can also be obtained from the standard constraint quantization of dirac. con-
sequences of the quantization (16)-(18) in the boundary state formalism (closed string)
and d-brane physics are under investigation [11]; as well as the quantization of charged
open string [12] and its possible consequences 1.

3 dirac quantization of the bosonic sector

in this section, we compute the dirac bracket starting from the standard poisson brackets

(x i(), pj()) = i

j(, ),

(pi(), pj()) = 0,
(x i(), x j()) = 0.

see [15] for a review of the dirac procedure of constrained quantization. since

x i +  x jfj

i = 2p jfj

[13] studies the closed string
interaction in the presence of noncommutative d-branes; the papers [14] study the eects of b-eld in
the boundary state formalism.

the boundary condition is a constraint in the phase space

i(0) = i() = 0,

i = 0, 1,    , p,

where we have introduced the notation

i() = 2p jfj

i + x jmj

i.

using the hamiltonian

hb =

1

4 z d(cid:16)( x)2 + (x)2(cid:17) ,

it is easy to show that one requires also the constraints at  = 0,  2

 i() = 0,

2n+1


p i() = 0,

n = 0, 1,    ,

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

and that these are all the second class constraints. we will denote them by (kn),  = 1, 2;
k = 0, 1,    , p; n = 0, 1,   ,

(1kn) = 2n

 k, (2kn) = 2n+1



p k.

(27)

these constraints are consistent with the explicit fourier mode expansion of the elds x i
and p i.

one can then compute the poisson matrix c (kn)(lm) of the constraints. the basic

ones are the c (k0)(l0)

s :

(k(), l()) = 2(f m)kl[(, ) + (, )],

(k(), p l()) = m kl(, ),

(p k(), p l()) = 0

and in general

c (kn)(lm)(, ) = ((kn)(), (lm)()) = 2n

 2m

 c (k0)(l0)(, ).

(28)
(29)
(30)

(31)

a distinct feature of our case is that the constraints (27) are imposed only at the

boundary of the open string. as a result, the dirac bracket should be given by

(a(), b()) = (a(), b())

(a(), (kn)(



))c(kn)(lm)(

)((lm)(



), b()), (32)

where in place of an integral, we have a sum ,  over the endpoints 0, . we also adopt
the einstein summation convention for the indices k, l, n, m unless otherwise stated. with
an obvious labelling of the columns and rows of the matrix, the inverse c(kn)(lm)( ,  )
is given by

c(kn)(lm)(

it follows immediately from the triangular form of c(kn)(lm) that

(p i(), p j()) = 0

(35)

(36)

is not modied. to proceed with the computation of the rest of the dirac brackets among
x i and p i, one may try to invert the relations (34), (35) to determine the form of r and
s and then use them in (32). however the explicit form of r, s obtained this way are
highly singular and generally contain ambiguities. fortunately, there is a trick to bypass
these steps. we will now show that it is in fact possible to compute the desired brackets
using only the dening relations (34) and (35). the detailed form of r, s is not needed.

we rst compute (x i(), x j()), the denition (32) gives

(x i(), x j()) = 2(m 1f )ij x 

[2n

it is easy to see that (x i(), x j()) = 0 for ,  not both at the endpoints. now we

where we have used r d(, ) =  r d(, ) = 0 to get rid of the second term

on the left hand side of (35). therefore the rst and second term in (37) cancel each other
in (x i()  x i(0), x j()) and we are left with

(x i()  x i(0), x j()) = 2(m 1f )ij x

this can be obtained by taking the n = 0 case of (34), multiplying it withpkp 2k

and integrating over ; and note that

(41)

formally, if one exchange the order of integration and the sum in the above, one gets
zero times a delta function. therefore (41) calls for a better justication. one way to
justify it is to use a lattice regularization by replacing the interval [0, ] by a lattice of m
equidistant points with spacing  = /m,

since we know [6] from the d-brane eld theory considerations that

(x i(0), x j(0)) = (x i(), x j()),

it follows from (39) that the nontrivial dirac bracket must be

(x i(0), x j(0)) = (x i(), x j()) = 2(m 1f )ij.

next, we compute (x i(), p j()). it is straightforward to obtain

(x i(), p j()) = ij((, )  q(, )),

where

2m+1


(, )rmk(, )2k+1

 (, ).

q(, ) = x

using the denition (34) with n = 0, it is now easy to show that

q(, ) = 0  [(, )]=0 +   [(, )]=

(42)

(43)

(44)

(45)

(46)

(47)

and hence (, )  (, )  q(, ) has the desired property of having a vanishing
derivative when one of its arguments is at the boundary; and (, ) is just (, ) when
both arguments are away from the boundary. the fourier expansion of (, ) can be
found in [6].

needless to say, some of the steps presented above are a little formal. the consistent
quantization using modes [6] provides a more concrete basis of our calculation here and
can be viewed as a complementary viewpoint of the same quantization. from a practical
point of view, the modes commutation relations are more useful to perturbative string
calculations.

4 inclusion of fermions

in a generic background, the fermionic part of a rns open string 3 gets additional cou-
plings, for example

i

4 z bij

i

j.

(48)

the situation is much simpler for our case with the at background (2) and the complete
supersymmetric lagrangian can be easily written down. the equation of motion is not
modied

(49)
where  =  + ,  =   . the open string worldsheet in the type ii and type 0
string theories has the supersymmetry

i

+ = i

x  = ,

with the preserved supersymmetry parametrized by

the constrained quantization on the fermions can be similarly performed as in the
bosonic case above. however, since we know that i and x i are related by supersymmetry
and we have already derived the commutation relations for the x is, it is perhaps more
interesting not to repeat the dirac quantization here, but instead to utilize the power
of worldsheet supersymmetry to derive the dirac bracket for the is directly. this
approach is expected to be particularly useful in more complicated cases. for example in
the case [17] where the background is not constant but weak enough so that one can still
determine the leading nontrivial commutation relation for the open string; and in the case
of supersymmetric adsk  sk background [11] relevant for the ads/cft correspondance.
it is easy to see that ((), x ()) = 0. the reason is that the original poisson
bracket ((), x ()) is zero and the constraints never mix the bosonic and fermionic

elds, so this poisson bracket is not modied by the dirac procedure. applying (50), we
obtain

0 = (, x ) = (cid:18) [ i(x , x ) + (

[ i( x , x )  (

+, 
, 

+)  (
) + (

+, 
, 

)]  

+)]  (cid:19) .

(54)

now we will concentrate on the modied boundary condition (52). the dirac bracket
relations for the tranverse directions can be obtained simply by setting f = 0 in the
following. substituting (52) into the above, we obtain

(i

+, j

+) =

i

(x i, x k)(  f )k

j,

(i

) =

2

( x i, x k)( + f )k

j.

(55)

at  = 0, , the use of (9) allows one to express x i and  x i in terms of p k

x i = 2p k(f m 1)k

i,

 x i = 2p k(m 1)k

i.

thus

and so (55) implies

(x i(), x j()) = 2(m 1( + f ))ij (, ),
( x i(), x j()) = 2(m 1(  f ))ij (, ),

(i

+(), j

+()) = (i

(), j

()) = iij (, ),

(56)

(57)
(58)

(59)

with  and  at the boundary. it is also easy to see that in the interior of the string,
the dirac bracket is not modied and takes the same form as (59). therefore the fermion
commutator is not modied (except for the modication of the delta function) by the
presence of f and takes the standard form.

5 remarks

in the quantization procedure of dirac, eq.(41) is the only ambiguity. but as mentioned
in sec.2, it is inconsistent to say that (41) vanishes. also note that the ambiguity resides
only in the commutation relations for the endpoint coordinates, the quantization for the
spacetime coordinates in the interior of the opens string has no ambiguity, and their
commutation relations are the same as if f = 0. the lattice regularization we choose
there gives the same result we obtained in [6].
it leads to the conclusion that a d-
brane in the b eld background has a noncommutative worldvolume in the sense that its
worldvolume theory is the sym theory living on a noncommutative space.

upon quantization, the dirac bracket becomes the (anti)commutator of the operators.
from the point of view of the open string, the modications to the commutation relations

9

is not very much. but as discussed in [6], since the endpoint of the open string is
living on the d-brane, the d-brane worldvolume becomes a noncommutative one.
it
is well known that a noncommutative manifold can be described in the dual language
of the algebra of functions living on it, one immediately arrives at the conclusion that
the d-brane worldvolume eld theory is a noncommutative one, i.e., one with a modied
multipication. in fact it is easy to check that our modied commutators (44) are equivalent
to the following moyal product [18] dened on the d-brane worldvolume [1],

f ()  g( ) = exp(ij 
i


 j )f ()g( )|= ,

where i, i = 0,    , p are the d-brane worldvolume coordinates and

ij = i(f m 1)ij.

(60)

(61)

the noncommutative dp-brane worldvolume theory takes functionally the same form
as the sym9+1 theory dimensionally reduced to p + 1 dimensions, with the usual product
of elds replaced by the moyal product (60), and with the spacetime integral replaced by
a cyclic trace. it has been argued [5] that in the dlcq limit of   0 with

x   , b  1/2,
gs  3/2,
  ,

(62)
(63)

where gs is the string coupling constant, the sym lagrangian is exact and hence deserves
attention.

when this work is nearly nished, we learned that another group [19] has also employed
diracs procedure for the same problem, but their nal result is dierent from ours. the
reason is presumably that they chose a dierent regularization.
