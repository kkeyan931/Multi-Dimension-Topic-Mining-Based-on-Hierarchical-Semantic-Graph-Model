dynamics of d-brane black holes

abstract

we explore the interplay between black holes in supergravity and quantum eld theories on the world-
volumes of d-branes. each sheds light on the other in various ways. the world-volume description
provides a statistical mechanical picture of black hole entropy and a manifestly unitary account of
hawking radiation. the black hole description elucidates the nature of the couplings between the
world-volume theory and supergravity in the bulk. finally, the computation of greens functions in
the world-volume theory can be mapped in a large n limit to a classical minimization problem in
supergravity.

a brief summary of black hole entropy calculations for d-brane black holes is followed by a detailed
study of particle absorption by black holes whose string theory description involves d-branes inter-
secting along a string. a two-dimensional conformal eld theory with large central charge describes
the low-energy excitations of this string. in the string theory description, hawking radiation is simply
the time-reversal of particle absorption. the greybody factors (deviations in the power spectrum from
plancks law) are characteristic of conformal eld theory at nite temperature.

particle absorption by extremal three-branes is examined next, with particular attention to the
implications for supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimensions. a fascinating duality between
supergravity and gauge theory emerges from the study of these processes. fields of supergravity
are dual to local operators in the gauge theory. a non-renormalization theorem of n = 4 gauge
theory helps explain why certain aspects of the duality can be explored perturbatively. anomalous
dimensions of a large class of local operators in the gauge theory are shown to become large at strong
t hooft coupling, signaling a possible simplication of n = 4 gauge theory in this limit.

introduction

the usual conception of how string theory (see for example [1]) makes contact with the physical
world is that string theory is compactied from ten to four dimensions on a manifold of size on the
order 1032 cmroughly as small compared to a proton as a proton is to mount everest. all the
fundamental particles of the standard model of particle physics are supposed to be realized as
dierent excitation modes of strings. the most powerful of particle accelerators probe distances only
about a sixth of the way (on a logarithmic scale) between the protons size and the string scale, so
it is dicult to imagine how the stringy character of elementary particles could ever be directly
observed. there is however an extensive literature investigating the phenomenological implications of
string theory and how contact may yet be made with experiment (for a recent review see [2]).

string theory is also a quantum theory of gravity.

in fact, it is the only consistent quantum
theory to date which contains gravity in any dynamical sense. (in two and three dimensions, theories
of quantum gravity can be formulated, but they are non-dynamical in the sense that gravitons do
not propagate). another avenue, then, for connecting string theory with the physical world is via
quantum gravitational eects. as an example one might consider hawking radiation from black holes.
this is an essentially quantum mechanical eect: whereas black holes classically cannot radiate (due
to the causal structure of their geometry), quantum mechanically they radiate as blackbodies. for
many years a fundamental, microscopic description of this eect was almost as much a mystery in
string theory as in general relativity. however, recent advances in the description of string-theoretic
solitons have enabled string theorists to give an account of hawking radiation for a certain limited
class of black holes. it is worth emphasizing that we are still very far from experiment, particularly
since the black holes amenable to treatment in string theory in general carry a large electric charge.
astrophysically, such a charge would quickly be neutralized by infalling matter.

the recent developments in the understanding of dualities in string theory (for a review see [3]) are
very much at the heart of progress in the string-theoretic description of black holes. a particularly
prominent role has been played by the so-called d-branes [4], which are objects derived via a detailed
understanding of t-duality in open and closed string theories. closed string theories require that
strings cannot have ends, whereas open strings by denition do have ends. however, the full con-
sistency of closed string theories under duality symmetries requires the existence of d-branes, which
can be thought of as special surfaces on which strings are allowed to end. but they are more than
this mathematical characterization suggests: they are dynamical objects in themselves, with a denite
tension which at weak coupling is large compared to the tension of fundamental strings. the large
tension of d-branes suggests that they may be suitable objects from which to build black holes. the
development of this idea and its implications for the description of dynamical eects like hawking
radiation are two of the main themes of this thesis.

the link between extremal or near-extremal black holes and the world-volume theories describing

4

excitations of branes has been explored in a now-voluminous literature. various aspects of the general
program of understanding this link have been initiated in [5, 6] (entropy of eective string models), [7,
8] (hawking radiation processes), and [9, 10] (absorption into extremal three-branes). a tangentially
related subject, the probing of sub-string-scale geometries using d-branes, grew from the initial work
of [11] into the vast subject of matrix theory [12].

the excitations of d-branes at low energies are described by supersymmetric gauge theories [13].
this observation opens up yet another avenue for connecting string theory with mainstream physics:
if on one hand d-branes describe black holes, and on the other hand are characterized at low energies
by gauge theory, then perhaps some information about gauge theory is encoded in the supergravity
solutions of the corresponding black holes. the realization that there are concrete ways of developing
this correspondence is at present one of the main sources of excitement in the string theory community.
there are even hints that supersymmetry may no longer be an essential ingredient in the gravity
gauge theory correspondence. earlier work on extracting gauge theory physics from intersecting brane
congurations [14] relies very little on supergravity, but has yielded some remarkable insights into the
geometric character of supersymmetric gauge theory (for a review see [15]).

in the past few months, with the appearance of the papers [16, 17, 18, 19, 20], our entire un-
derstanding of the link through string theory and d-branes between supergravity and gauge theory
has evolved rapidly. the essential ingredients in the new approach are the following two insights:
1) information about the infrared behavior of gauge theories is encoded in the near-horizon geome-
try of black branes in supergravity; and 2) perturbations to the gauge theory can be implemented
by constraints on the supergravity elds on a hypersurface which surrounds the brane at a distance
close to where the near-horizon geometry merges with asymptotically at space. the second insight,
achieved in various forms in [17, 18, 19, 20], has been termed holography by witten. although this
term (originally proposed by t hooft and susskind as applicable to black holes) has been used in a
somewhat murky fashion in the string theory literature, its current application is appropriate in the
following sense. the dynamics of the gauge theory is mirrored in the supergravity theory subjected
to boundary conditions on the hypersurface, which is of one lower dimension than the ambient space
(but of the same dimension as the world-volume of the gauge theory). thus one views the gauge
theory as a hologram of the supergravity.

all but the last two chapters of this thesis are devoted to the pre-holography era of black holes in
string theory. chapter 2 presents a brief investigation of the entropy of black holes built out of d-
branes. the focus is on the two examples which have been most intensively studied in the literature:
d3-branes in ten-dimensional spacetime, and three-charge black holes with regular horizon in ve-
dimensional spacetime. the remarkable insight that the d-brane approach yields is that the entropy
of certain black holes can be explained in terms of the statistical mechanics of the world-volume theory
of d-branes.

the remainder of the thesis is split into two parts. the rst part, chapters 3-5, is based on the
papers [21, 22, 23]. the focus is on the string theory description of hawking radiation and particle
absorption by near-extremal black holes in four and ve dimensions. the string theory model for
these black holes is an eective string whose excitations are described by a conformal eld theory
(cft). the inuential paper [5] includes a computation of the central charge of this conformal eld
theory via a moduli space argument. in chapter 2 we develop a more concise but limited version
of this argument using index theorems. here the eective string is realized as a d3-brane with two
of its spatial dimensions wrapped around a four-dimensional manifold. a more familiar description,
developed initially in [6], is to view the eective string as some number of d1-branes embedded in
d5-branes (whose four extra dimensions are again wrapped around a four-dimensional manifold). a
black hole in ve dimensions can be obtained by wrapping the eective string around a circle. black
holes in four dimensions have also been treated via eective strings which can be constructed within
string theory [24, 25], but which arise most naturally intersecting ve-branes in m-theory [26, 27].

in the extensive recent literature comparing black hole entropy with microscopic state counts,

5

black holes which admit an eective string description have always proven the most reliably tractable.
agreements between the bekenstein-hawking entropy and the statistical mechanical entropy are no
longer considered miraculous in the case of supersymmetric black holes, because the two calculations
are dierent ways of counting states that preserve supersymmetry. these so-called bps states are
generally protected against mass renormalizations by their short multiplet structure under the super-
symmetry algebra. more surprising are successful comparisons of near-extremal black hole entropy
with statistical mechanical analyses, because in such cases there is no supersymmetry to prevent mi-
crostates from changing their masses as one proceeds from the region of weak coupling where the
statistical mechanical analysis is performed to the region of strong coupling where supergravity is
applicable. in chapter 2 we will see that such agreements are indeed rather the exception than the
rule. however, comparisons of the entropy of near-extremal eective string black holes have succeeded
in certain limits [6]. as it turns out, the central charge alone determines the eective string models
entropy in the relevant limits, usually termed the dilute gas regime.1 thus the status of the central
charge as a non-renormalized quantity (namely a measure of the density of bps states) basically
guarantees the success of the entropy comparisons in the dilute gas regime.

the original realization [5] of the eective string cft was as a supersymmetric non-linear sigma
model whose target space was a symmetric power of a four dimensional manifold. it is straightforward
to extract the central charge and proceed with entropy calculations, but it has proven more dicult
to determine what are the primary elds and how they couple to the elds of supergravity. precisely
these questions can be explored via calculations of absorption and hawking emission by black holes.
in the semi-classical supergravity description of black holes, hawking radiation and particle ab-
sorption are radically dierent phenomena: absorption is a classical eect, while hawking radiation
is strictly quantum mechanical. to be precise, hawkings formula (see for example [28]) relating
the emission rate d of massless particles into an element of wave-number phase space d3k to the
absorption cross-section  is

where the temperature is given in terms of the surface gravity  at the horizon:

plancks constant is involved in two essential ways, and both the hawking rate and the hawking
temperature vanish as h  0. from here on we will adopt units in which h = c = kb = 1.

in string theory the relation between absorption and hawking radiation is simply time-reversal.
absorption into an extremal black hole is mediated by s-matrix elements which can be calculated
from a knowledge of couplings between supergravity and the eective string. hawking radiation is
impossible for an extremal black hole, but the eective string description extends easily to the near-
extremal case, and then the same s-matrix element that describes particle absorption also mediates
hawking radiation. time-reversal symmetry is broken only by the kinematics of the thermal eld
theory on the eective string. absorption and emission processes are related by detailed balance,
so that an eective string black hole can be in equilibrium with a thermal sea of particles in the
ambient space (it should be remarked at this point that unlike schwarzschild black holes, near-extremal
black holes generically have positive specic heat, so thermal equilibrium is possible). indeed, in the
statistical mechanical string theory picture, (1.1) is nothing more than the statement of detailed
balance. a concrete illustration of this point will be developed in chapter 3 in the context of xed
scalars.

supergravities in dimensions less than ten with extended supersymmetry emerge from the low-
energy limit of string theory, and in general have a large number of scalar elds [29]. for the purpose

1this is only true once the proper identication of charges and angular momenta has been made in the eective

string description.

of studying eective string black holes, we will primarily be interested in maximally supersymmetric
theories in four or ve dimensions, which admit extremal black holes with regular horizons ([30] and
references therein). some of the scalar elds can be regarded as moduli of the compactied geometry
that takes the theory down from ten dimensions to four or ve. in general, small uctuations of these
scalars obey the curved space wave equation (the massless klein-gordon equation), and are termed
minimal scalars. their absorption into black holes can be described in the eective string language
as a massless closed string state hitting a set of intersecting d-branes and turning into a pair of open
strings that run in opposite directions along the 1 + 1-dimensional intersection manifold, as depicted
in gure 1.1a). in principle these absorption amplitudes can be computed via a string disk diagram,
gure 1.1b), with one insertion in the bulk (the closed string vertex) and two on the boundary (the
open string vertices). calculations along these lines have been explored [31], but diculties arise due
to the complicated nature of the d-brane bound state which constitutes the eective string. it proves
more insightful to propose as a low-energy eective action the dirac-born-infeld (dbi) action [32].
because this action includes among its elds the induced metric on the eective string, the dilaton,
and other elds of supergravity (in a manner recently systematized in [33, 34, 35, 36] for certain
simpler brane congurations than the eective string), there is an implicit prescription for calculating
the coupling between supergravity elds and eective string excitations.

in view of the extensive literature on minimal scalars, our primary focus will be on another class,
the so-called xed scalars ([21] and references therein) whose absorption cross-section at low energies
(and consequently hawking emission) is suppressed by powers of the energy relative to that of the
minimal scalars. in the eective string description, xed scalars couple to no less than four excitations
on the eective string. in gure 1.1b), one would have four rather than two boundary insertions. in
the dbi eective action, the coupling turns out to be quartic rather than quadratic in the elementary
elds. morally speaking, one can view the suppression of the absorption cross-section as due to
the amount of phase space available at low energies. from the point of view of supergravity, the
suppression is due to a potential barrier, which might also be thought of as a variable mass term in
the klein-gordon equation.

the standard wkb method for barrier penetration does not apply to the calculation of the low-
energy cross-section because the wavelength is longer than the width of the barrier. instead, when
the linearized equations of motion are not exactly soluble, one can use approximation techniques rst
developed in [37]. a substantial part of chapters 3-6 is devoted to the application of these techniques
to various extremal and near-extremal black holes. in particular, chapter 4 is devoted to an analysis
of partial waves of a minimal scalar falling into near-extremal black holes in ve dimensions, while

7

chapter 6 focuses on partial waves of minimal scalars falling into d3-branes in ten dimensions. aside
from a derivation of a version of the optical theorem in arbitrary dimensions, the semi-classical
calculations in these chapters are fairly nondescript. the real interest lies in the relevance to a
microscopic string theory description.

the description of partial wave absorption in the eective string model is somewhat problematic
because of our limited understanding of the underlying conformal eld theory. it is clear [38] that
angular momentum is carried by the fermionic excitations of the eective string. the pauli exclusion
principle would then seem to imply that only a nite number of partial waves are capable of coupling
to the eective string. the analysis of chapter 4 suggests that this number is large and possibly related
to the principle of cosmic censorship.

in chapter 5, an attempt is made to move a few steps closer to astrophysical reality by considering
particles with spin (photons or chiral fermions) falling into a black hole in four dimensions. the
eective string description is again found to be in remarkable agreement with the functional form of
the cross-sections. supersymmetry still plays an essential role in the discussion, since the black hole
under consideration is realized in pure n = 4 supergravity. this is not a theory which descends in
any simple way from string theory, so the eective string model lacks a microscopic justication (in
contrast to the case of the d1-d5 bound state in ve dimensions or the four-charge black hole in
n = 8 four-dimensional supergravity). however, taking it as a useful eective description in terms of
conformal eld theory we explore the properties of conformal greens functions at nite temperature.
the powerful constraints of conformal invariance essentially dictate the energy dependence of the
cross-section, also termed the greybody factor.

the second part of the thesis, chapters 6-8, is based on the papers [10, 39, 18], and is concerned
primarily with the relation via string theory of ten-dimensional type iib supergravity with four-
dimensional n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills (sym) theory. the supergravity theory is the low-
energy limit of type iib string theory, which is one of the two maximally supersymmetric string
theories in ten dimensions. one of the charged branes in this theory is the d3-brane, which (following
[4]) one views as a 3 + 1-dimensional hypersurface (usually at) in 9 + 1-dimensional spacetime, on
which strings are allowed to end. one of the early discoveries [13] was that the low-energy eective
theory describing excitations of n coincident d3-branes is n = 4 sym theory with gauge group u (n ).
it has long been hoped that this theory, on account of its supersymmetry, conformal symmetry, and
niteness, would provide one of the simplest examples of an interacting quantum eld theory in 3 + 1
dimensions. however, the theory has proven notoriously dicult to solve in any sense similar to
the exactly solvable quantum eld theories in 1 + 1 dimensionsfor example rational conformal eld
theories [40, 41, 42].2 for this reason, any handle one can get on n = 4 sym via d3-branes is of
tremendous interest, independent of black hole physics.
in fact, the same supergravity methods used to explore low-energy absorption processes in the
case of four- and ve-dimensional black holes apply equally to the case of the extremal d3-brane.
in chapter 6 these methods are compared with tree-level calculations in the world-volume theory. it
is shown that the energy dependence of absorption cross-sections is predicted reliably by the gauge
theory;3 however it is only for low partial waves (the s-wave or the p-wave) for the infalling particle
that we have been able to obtain the properly normalized cross-section through tree-level calculations.
in a sense even this level of agreement between gauge theory and supergravity is surprising, because
the gauge theory calculations are valid only when the t hooft coupling gy mn is small, whereas the
supergravity calculations are reliable only when the spacetime curvatures are small. these turn out
to be exactly opposite limits. in chapter 7 we advance an explanation for why the tree-level gauge
theory computation for the s-wave was in fact reliable. the absorption cross-sections are related to

2see however [43] for recent progress on extracting correlation functions of n = 4 sym using superspace techniques.
3in light of recent developments [18, 19] relating kaluza-klein masses in the near-horizon geometry to the conformal
dimensions of gauge theory operators, this agreement illustrates how the dimensions of operators coupling to arbitrary
partial waves can be computed successfully at weak coupling.

d3-branes; this is thought to be a non-abelian extension of the dirac-born-infeld (dbi) action [44].
while the dynamics of the dbi theory may be reected in a very complicated two-point function dbi
,
certain two-point functions in the renormalizable gauge theory are quite simple and well-understood on
account of its conformal symmetry. the example considered in chapter 7 is the two-point function of
the stress-energy tensor, which pertains to the absorption of gravitons polarized parallel to the brane.
this two-point function is in fact related to a conformal anomaly, and as such can be computed
reliably at one loop. the corresponding statement regarding the graviton cross-section is that it may
be computed reliably at tree level: all radiative corrections cancel.

in hindsight the formula (1.3) should have immediately suggested the far-reaching extension of
the gauge theorysupergravity correspondence which we formulate in chapter 8. as a preliminary to
the statement of this extension, it is perhaps useful to review a heuristic picture of the throat-brane
correspondence developed in conversations with prof. c. callan. string theory oers two dierent
descriptions of three-branes, each valid in a dierent regime of couplings. the rst is the low-energy
supergravity solution, pictured schematically in gure 1.2a). the near-horizon region (pictured as a
long throat in the gure) has the geometry of anti-de sitter space, ads5, times a sphere s5 of constant
radius. it is joined in the mouth region (the vicinity of the dotted line) to the asymptotically at
region. the second description, gure 1.2b) is simply a cluster of n coincident d3-branes in at
space. because these two pictures describe the same physical system, the response to perturbations
(i.e. infalling particles from asymptotically at innity) should be the same. experience with the
linearized equations of motion in supergravity teaches us that perturbations which are the same far
from the brane are also the same to leading order in small energies when propagated in the curved
geometry down to the dotted line as when propagated to the location of the d-branes in at space.
now imagine solving supergravity in the throat subject to boundary conditions imposed on the dotted
line. in view of the physical equivalence of a) and b), that solution should encode the same physics
as the d-brane world-volume gauge theory, when subjected to the same external perturbations.

the claim can be made precise in the following fashion. consider a eld  in supergravity which
couples to a local operator o in the world-volume. for the sake of having a mathematically well-
dened problem, consider wick-rotating both the gauge theory and the supergravity to a euclidean

9

signature (this is a well-dened operation on the supergravity side because the near-horizon metric is
conformal to at space). let us dene k[0] as the minimum of the supergravity action s[] in the
throat, subject to dirichlet boundary conditions  = 0 imposed at the mouth. in the low-energy
limit, this is equivalent to imposing asymptotic boundary conditions on supergravity elds in anti-
de sitter spacetime. then the extension of (1.3) can be formulated as an identication of the free
energy of the gauge theory with the supergravity action:

zym[0] = efy m [0] =(cid:28)exp(cid:18)z d4x 0o(cid:19)(cid:29)

= ek[0] = maximum
=0 on ads

es[] .

(1.4)

the main caveat to this identication is that the validity of classical supergravity requires that the
number of d3-branes be large so that curvatures are small. more precisely the t hooft coupling
gy mn must be large.
it is possible that quantum loop corrections to the supergravity action
(obtained by replacing the maximum in the last expression by a formal path integral, evaluated via
the saddle point approximation) can provide at least the leading 1/n 2 corrections to the large n
behavior of fy m . a truly satisfactory treatment of such eects and the (possibly more important)
 corrections must be carried out via the full type iib string theory in the near-horizon background
geometry. unfortunately, this geometry is supported by a ramond-ramond ve-form ux, and it is
not known how to incorporate such a eld into the usual non-linear sigma model approach to string
theory.

from the point of view of quantum eld theory, however, an exciting consequence of (1.4) is that in
the strong coupling limit, n = 4 gauge theory seems to simplify to something which can be captured
by a classical minimization problem.4 in particular, as will be suggested in chapter 8, all operators
in the gauge theory except chiral primaries and their descendants (the operators corresponding to
elds in the supergravity theory) may be expected to acquire a large mass dimension in the strong
coupling limit. it is conceivable that they even drop out of the operator algebra in this limit, leaving
us with a greatly reduced set of nite gauge-invariant greens functions. it would be the realization
of the dreams of decades to obtain simple expressions for these greens functions, or at least simple
equations for them.

4the following ideas arose in a discussion with prof. t. banks.

entropy considerations

a large segment of the recent string theory literature, starting with [5], is devoted to comparisons of
the bekenstein-hawking entropy for a black hole or brane with entropies derived by counting states
in some microscopic theory proposed to describe the black hole degrees of freedom. finding the
bekenstein-hawking entropy is straightforward, since it is one quarter of the horizon area in planck
units. as a rule, the microscopic calculations rely on either conformal invariance or the assumption
of weak coupling to aid in the counting.

in section 2.1 we calculate the bekenstein-hawking entropy of clusters of coincident dp-branes and
compare with the free eld theory result derived from the matter content of the world-volume theory.
these results represent an extension of the work of [45] and have also appeared in various forms in
the literature [46, 47, 48, 49].

in section 2.2 we exhibit a derivation of the eective string model of ve-dimensional black holes
starting from a d3-brane wrapped around a two-cycle of a four-dimensional compact manifold. the
methods are similar to those developed in [27] to study eective string descriptions of four-dimensional
black holes. index theorems relating the dimensions of cohomology groups to integrals of characteristic
classes are used to calculate the central charge of the cft characterizing uctuations of the eective
string.

the tension p:

for the string metric as for the einstein metric. this will always happen unless the dilaton does
something singular on the horizon, which would seem unphysical because the horizon is supposed to
be locally undetectable to an infalling observer.

(2.17)

when n = 4 (i.e. for the three-brane),  = c = 3/4, a result rst obtained in [45, 53]. results have
been obtained in [46, 49]. for n 6= 4, the ratio in square brackets in (2.16) is precisely the t hooft
coupling of the world-volume gauge theory multiplied by the power of the temperature needed to make
it dimensionless. this has led to the conjecture [48] that the semi-classical result fcl constitutes a
prediction of gravity about the entropy of maximally supersymmetric gauge theory at strong coupling.
more generally, one would expect that the exact free energy interpolates between ffree and fcl as one
proceeds from weak to strong coupling. it remains a mystery how one might make any concrete check
on this interesting speculation.

2.2 embedding of three-branes and the eective string

in [27], methods of algebraic geometry were used to make an exact count of the degrees of freedom on
the eective string that underlies microscopic models of four-dimensional black holes [25, 26]. these
powerful methods can be adapted to the analogous computation for ve-dimensional black holes, where
the eective string [5, 6] is a left-right symmetric conformal eld theory with (4, 4) supersymmetry.
when the eective string is realized as q1 d1-branes bound to q5 d5-branes wound around t 5, it
was argued in [6, 54] that the number of left-moving bosons (real scalars) was n b
l = 4q1q5. the
central charge consequently was found to be c = 6q1q5, and the microscopic entropy of the conformal
eld theory (cft) at level (nl, nr),

agreed with the bekenstein-hawking entropy of the geometry with the same charges.

s = 2pq1q5(pnl +pnr) ,

(2.18)

the purpose of this section is to obtain the formula n b

l = 4q1q5 from a t-dual picture where
the d1-d5 system is replaced by two sets of intersecting d3-branes. we will restrict ourselves to bps
brane congurations, with the understanding that once the central charge of the eective string cft
is established the general dilute-gas formula (2.18) follows immediately for near-extremal black holes
as well as extremal ones. the extremal entropy calculation can be regarded as a subcase of [5] where
the analysis is particularly simple.

13

the d3-brane must span the entire s1 which the eective string wraps, so its embedding in the
transverse t 4 is specied by a two-cycle. for a more general manifold m of complex dimension 2,
the embedding of the d3-brane is a complex curve p . in order to preserve some supersymmetry, m
must be either t 4 or k3, and p must be a holomorphic cycle. using the same letter p to denote the
dual of p in integral cohomology, the requirement of holomorphicity is p = 0. carrying over the
assumptions of [27] that m is much larger than the string scale, that s1 is much larger yet, and that
p is a very ample divisor of m , one is left with the fairly simple problem of determining the moduli
of the eective string from kaluza-klein (kk) reduction of the degrees of freedom on a d3-brane
wrapping a given homology cycle.

the real scalar bosons on the eective string come from two sources: the moduli of the d3-brane

embedding and the d3-brane gauge eld, kk-reduced to 1 + 1 dimensions. explicitly,

n b

l = dp + b1 ,

(2.19)

where dp is the number of real moduli of the embedding of p in m and b1 is the rst betti number
of p . the number of right-moving bosons is of course the same since the eective string in this case
is left-right symmetric. note in particular that b1, not the numbers b1 of self-dual and anti-self-dual
one-forms in h 1(p ), enter into the formulas for n b
r . this is in contrast to the m5-brane
case considered in [27]. the dierence is that the eld strength of the gauge eld on the d3-brane is
not required to be self-dual, whereas for the m5-brane it is.

l and n b

following the methods of [27], let us now compute dp and b1. it is hoped that this simple application
of the powerful techniques of algebraic geometry will lead to a more detailed understanding of the
eective string.

to compute dp one needs to give a description of the moduli space of embeddings of p in m .
the holomorphic cycle p cannot be specied as the vanishing locus of a holomorphic function on m
because holomorphic functions on m are constant. but it is possible to do something almost as good:
one can specify p as the vanishing locus of a holomorphic section s of a holomorphic line bundle l
over m . the convenience of this description is two-fold. first, the chern class of l is c(l) = 1 + p .
and second, the moduli space is the (complex) projectivization of the dolbeault cohomology space
h 0(m,l) [27]. this is because the zeroth dolbeault space species precisely the dierent ways of
picking a section s with s = 0; the projectivization is necessary because s for nonzero complex 
species the same surface p as does s. using an index theorem, one obtains

(2.20)

the validity of the second line depends on c1(m ) = 0, which is guaranteed for k3 by su(2) holonomy.
for t 4 this is 0 while for
since m is a complex two-manifold, c2(m ) is the euler number (m ):
k3 it is 24. a detailed exposition of the properties of k3 can be found in [55], and [56] contains all
the information regarding characteristic classes needed for the present discussion. in the third line of
(2.20), d is the intersection number of p with itself. given an integral basis a of h 2(m, z), the
intersection form is

dab = 1

2zm

14

expanding the cycle p = pa paa in the dual basis of the homology group, one obtains d =

(2.21)

has p = q11 + q55 (as before, in homology) where 1 and 5 are two tori whose cross product is
the full t 4: the x1-x2 torus and x3-x4 torus, for example. then d = q1q5.

finally, one can use the observation [27] that all dolbeault numbers but the zeroth vanish when p

is very ample to obtain

dp = 2d + 1

6 (m )  2 .

(2.22)

the task of computing b1 is conceptually more straightforward than dp , since b1 = 2 (p ) where
(p ) is the euler characteristic of p . the euler character of p is c1(p ), and using the factorization
property of chern classes one can argue that c1(p ) = p . heuristically, the derivation of this equality
rests on identifying bers of l over a point of p as the part of m s tangent space normal to p . roughly
speaking, when we take the tensor sum of normal and tangent bundles to p , we obtain the tangent
bundle of m restricted to p , whose chern class is simply 1. chern classes multiply over tensor sums,
so c(p )c(l) = 1 and consequently c(p ) = 1  p . the subtleties we have ignored in this explanation
are concisely dealt in [27] via an exact sequence argument. now one can compute

(p ) =zp

c1(p ) = zp

p = zm

p 2 = 2d

and obtain at last

b1 = 2d + 2 .

d-brane approach to xed scalars

3.1

introduction

many conventional wisdoms of general relativity are being reconsidered in the context of string theory
simply because the string eective actions for gravity coupled to matter are more general than those
considered in the past. one of the important dierences is the presence of non-minimal scalargauge
eld couplings, leading to a breakdown of the no hair theorem (see the discussion in [57, 58]).
another new eect is the existence of certain scalars which, in the presence of an extremal charged
black hole with regular horizon [59, 60, 61, 62, 63], acquire an eective potential [64, 65] which xes
their value at the horizon [66, 67, 68, 69]. these are the xed scalars. the absorption of xed scalars
into d = 4 extremal black holes was considered in [70] and found to be suppressed compared to
ordinary scalars: whereas the absorption cross-section of the latter approaches the horizon area ah as
  0 [71], the xed scalar cross-section was found to vanish as 2.
this chapter is based on the paper [21]. our main result is that the xed scalar emission and
absorption rates, as calculated using the methods of semi-classical gravity, are exactly reproduced by
the eective string model of black holes based on intersecting d-branes. the d-brane description of the
ve-dimensional black holes involves n1 1-branes and n5 5-branes with some left-moving momentum
along the intersection [5, 6]. the low-energy dynamics of the resulting bound state is believed to be
well described by an eective string wound n1n5 times around the compactication volume [72, 7, 8,
73, 74, 75]. this model has been successful in matching not only the extremal [5, 6] and near-extremal
[54, 51, 72] entropies, but the rate of hawking radiation of ordinary scalars as well [8, 73, 74, 75].

as part of our study, we have computed the semi-classical absorption cross-section of xed scalars
from both extremal and near-extremal d = 5 black holes. in general, we nd cross-sections with a
non-trivial energy dependence. in particular, for the extremal d = 5 black holes with two charges
equal,

abs =

where rk , r  rk and tl are parameters related to the charges. at low energies the cross-section
vanishes as 2, just as in the d = 4 case studied in [70]. for non-extremal black holes, however,
the cross-section no longer vanishes as   0. for near-extremal d = 5 black holes, we nd (for
  th  tl)

abs() =

ahr2

k(2 + 42t 2

h) ,

4

where th is the hawking temperature. a similar formula holds for the d = 4 case. thus, even at low
energies, the xed scalar cross-section is sensitive to several features of the black hole geometry. by

16

comparison, the limiting value of the ordinary scalar cross-section is given by the horizon area alone.
all of the complexities of the xed scalar emission and absorption will be reproduced by, and nd a
simple explanation in, the eective string picture.

the absorption cross-section for ordinary scalars nds its explanation in the d-brane description
in terms of the process scalar  l + r together with its time-reversal l + r  scalar, where l
and r represent left-moving and right-moving modes on the eective string [6, 7, 8, 73, 74, 75]. the
absorption cross-section for xed scalars is so interesting because, as we will show, it depends on the
existence of eight kinematically permitted processes:

1) scalar  l + l + r + r
2) scalar + l  l + r + r
3) scalar + r  l + l + r
4) scalar + l + r  l + r

(3.1)

and their time-reversals. one of the main results of this chapter is that competition among 14 and
their time-reversals gives the following expression for the xed scalar absorption cross-section,

where tl and tr are the left and right-moving temperatures, te is the eective string tension
[57, 58, 62, 72, 76, 77, 78, 79] and r2
5 are essentially the 1-brane and 5-brane charges. the only
restriction on the validity of (3.2) is that tl, tr,   1/r1  1/r5 so that we stay in the dilute gas
regime and keep the wavelength of the xed scalar much larger than the longest length scale of the
black hole. remarkably, the very simple eective string result (3.2) is in complete agreement with
the rather complicated calculations in semi-classical gravity! the semi-classical calculations involve
no unknown parameters, so comparison with (3.2) allows us to infer te. the result is in agreement
with the fractional string tension necessary to explain the entropy of near-extremal 5-branes [76].

to set up the semi-classical calculations, we will develop in section 3.2 an eective action technique
for deriving the equations of motion for xed scalars. this technique shows how the xed scalar
equation couples with einsteins equations when r1 6= r5; therefore, we restrict ourselves to the
regime r1 = r5 = r where the xed scalar equation is straightforward. we briey digress to four
dimensions, demonstrating how the same techniques lead to similar equations for xed scalars. clearly,
comparisons analogous to the ones made in this chapter are possible for the four-dimensional case,
where the eective string appears at the triple intersection of m-theory 5-branes [26]. in section 3.3
we use the dirac-born-infeld (dbi) action to see how various scalars in d = 5 couple to the eective
string. the main result of section 3.3 is that the leading coupling of the xed scalar is to four
uctuation modes of the string. this highlights its dierence from the moduli which couple to two
in section 3.4 we return to ve dimensions and exhibit approximate solutions
uctuation modes.
to the xed scalar equation, deriving the semi-classical emission and absorption rates.
in section
3.5 we calculate the corresponding rates with d-brane methods, nding complete agreement with
semi-classical gravity. we sum up in section 3.6.

where x5 is the string direction and  is the scale of the four 5-brane directions transverse to the

, and the scale  of the x5 (string) direction as measured in the d = 6 einstein-frame metric:

 and assuming
that the rst two have, respectively, the magnetic and the electric components (with the charges p and

with the kaluza-klein charge qk, we may eliminate them from the action (3.7). the result is an
eective two-dimensional theory with coordinates xm = (t, r) and the action given (up to the constant

(3.11)

the potential f in (3.10) has the global minimum at e4 = qp 1, e4 = q2
kq1p 1. these values
of  and  are thus xed points to which these elds are attracted on the horizon, which is why such
elds can be called xed scalars. by contrast, the decoupled scalar  can be chosen to be equal to an
arbitrary constant.

as an aside, we note that this structure of the potential (3.10) explains why one needs at least three
dierent charges to get an extremal d = 5 black hole with a regular horizon (i.e. with scalar elds
that do not blow up):
it is necessary to have at least three exponential terms to conne the two
xed scalars. if the number of non-vanishing charges is smaller than three, then one or both scalars
will blow up at the horizon.

equivalent actions and potentials are found for theories that are obtained from the one above by
u-duality. for example, in the case of the ns-ns truncation of type ii action, which has a d = 5

1the full set of equations and constraints is derived by rst keeping the 2-d metric gmn general and using its
diagonal gauge-xed form only after the variation. in addition to choosing gmn diagonal as in (3.8), one can use the
gauge freedom to impose one more relation between a and b.

black hole solution representing a bound state of ns-ns strings and solitonic 5-branes, we can put
the action in the form (3.9), where  is still the scale of the string direction as measured by the 6-d
metric, while the roles of 2 (the scale of the 4-torus) and  are interchanged.2
now (3.9) reduces to a particle action (we choose  = const)

in order to nd the static black hole solution to (3.9), we dene  = 2c + a, d = 2e3ca+bdr.

the general solution depends on the three gauge charges p, q, qk and one parameter which we
will call  which governs the degree of non-extremality. in a convenient gauge, the solution reads

we also note that e2 = r2(r2  2).

in the extremal limit,  = 0, one nds

e = hqk ,

e = hp ,

e = hq ,

where hq = cq + q and  = 1/r2. the constants cqk , cp , cq must satisfy cqk cp cq = 1 in order for
the 5-d metric to approach the minkowski metric at innity. the two remaining arbitrary constants
correspond to the asymptotic values of  and . as is clear from (3.9),(3.10), shifting  and 
by constants is equivalent to a rescaling of qk, q, p . the assumption that  = 0 and  =

2there exists an equivalent representation of this ns-ns action where the xed scalars are the 5-d dilaton and the

scale of the string direction, while the scale of the 4-torus is decoupled.

20

the somewhat unusual form of the last relation is due to our choice  = 0 instead of more standard
5 = 0.

in using the black hole solution (3.14), (3.15), we will often nd it convenient to work in terms of

characteristic radii rather than the charges, so we dene

from the classical gr point of view, these parameters can take on any values. recent experience has
shown, however, that when the radii satisfy [75]

r0, rk  r1, r5

(3.19)

the black hole can be successfully matched to a bound state of d1-branes and d5-branes (with no
anti-branes present) carrying a dilute gas of massless excitations propagating along the bound d1-
branes. evidence for this gas can be seen directly in the energy, entropy and temperature of the black
hole solution. introducing a new parameter  through

one nds the following expressions [51, 75] for the adm mass, hawking temperature and the entropy

a fact which also has a natural thermodynamic interpretation. these results will be heavily used in
later comparisons of classical gr results with d-brane calculations of corresponding quantities.

let us now turn to the discussion of the propagation of perturbations on this black hole background.
the goal will be to calculate the classical absorption cross-section of various scalar elds and eventually
to compare them with comparable d-brane quantities. the behavior of free scalars, like , is quite
dierent from that of xed scalars, like  and . the spherically symmetric uctuations of  obey
the standard massless klein-gordon equation in this background. namely, if  = eit (r), then

(cid:20)r3 d

(hr3 d

) + 2h1h p h qh qk(cid:21)  = 0 ,

(3.23)

this scattering problem, and its d-brane analog, have been analyzed at length recently and we will
have no more to say about it. the spherically symmetric uctuations of the metric functions a, b, c
and the scalars ,  in general obey a complicated set of coupled dierential equations.3 however,
3the spherically symmetric uctuations of the gauge elds need not be considered explicitly: since the dependence

on h and f is gaussian, they are automatically included when going from (3.7) to (3.9).

21

when the charges p and q are set equal, a dramatic simplication occurs: the background value of
 in (3.15) (i.e. the scale of the transverse 4-torus) becomes constant and its small uctuations 
decouple from those of the other elds.4 the gaussian eective action for  extracted from (3.9) is

and spherically symmetric uctuations  = eit  obey

this is the standard klein-gordon equation (3.23) augmented by a space-dependent mass term orig-
inating from the expansion of the eective potential f (, ) in (3.10). this mass term falls o as
r6 at large r, and, in the extremal case, blows up like 8/r2 near the horizon at r = 0. this is the
l(l + 2)/r2 angular momentum barrier for an l = 2 partial wave in d = 5. this transmutation of
angular momentum plays an important role in the behavior of the xed scalar cross-section. for later
analysis, it will be convenient to rewrite this equation using the coordinate  = 1/r2:

(3.26)

note that, when all the three charges are equal, p = q = qk, the background value of the other
scalar, , is constant as well. then the small uctuations of this eld decouple from gravitational
perturbations and satisfy the same equation as , (3.25). if only two of the charges are equal, then
there is only one xed scalar which has a constant background value and decouples from gravitational
perturbations. we would also like to know the xed scalar scattering equations (and solutions) for
the general qk 6= q 6= p black hole. this problem is surprisingly complicated due to mixing with
gravitational perturbations. the disentanglement of the equations was achieved in [83].

to summarize, we have identied a set of scalars around the familiar type ii string d = 5 black
hole solution which merit the name of xed scalars in that their horizon values are xed by the
background charges. their uctuations in the black hole background satisfy the klein-gordon equa-
tion, augmented by a position-dependent mass term. in section 3.4 we will solve the new equations
to nd the absorption cross-section by the black hole for these special scalars.

3.2.2 d = 4 case

previous experience [84, 85, 26, 86, 74, 87] suggests that one may be able to extend the d = 5 successes
in reproducing entropies and radiation rates with d-brane methods to d = 4 black holes carrying 4
charges. although we will not pursue the p-brane approach to d = 4 black hole dynamics in this
chapter, this is a natural place to discuss d = 4 xed scalars and to record their scattering equations
for later use.

a convenient representation of the d = 4 black hole with four dierent charges [60, 61, 62] is the
d = 11 supergravity conguration 555 of three 5-branes intersecting over a common string [26, 88].
the three magnetic charges are related to the numbers of 5-branes in three dierent hyperplanes, while
the electric charge has kaluza-klein origin. the reduction to d = 4 of the relevant part of the d = 11
supergravity (or d = 10 type iia) action has the form

(3.27)

4similar simplication occurs when any two of the three charges are equal. for example, if p = qk we may introduce
 =  1
2 ( + ) (in terms of which the kinetic part in the action (3.9) preserves its diagonal form)
to discover that   has decoupled uctuations. the resulting equation for   has the same form as the equation for 
in the case of p = q.

the scalar elds are expressed in terms of components of the internal 7-torus part of the d = 11
metric. by the logic of the previous section, the scale  of the 6-torus transverse to the intersection
string is a decoupled scalar, while the elds , ,  (related to the scale of the string direction and the
ratios of sizes of 2-tori shared by pairs of 5-branes) are xed scalars. if the internal part of the d = 11
metric is

as in the d = 5 case, for the generic values of charges the spherically symmetric perturbations of this
solution obey a complicated system of equations (for discussions of perturbations of single-charged
dilatonic black holes see, e.g., [89, 43, 90, 91]). however, when the three magnetic charges are equal, 
and  have constant background values, and so their small spherically-symmetric uctuations decouple
from the metric perturbations,

leading to the following radial klein-gordon equation with an extra mass term:

represented in this form this is very similar to (3.26) found in the d = 5 case: the dierential operator
and mass terms are exactly the same, while the frequency terms are related by   2, 3(1 +
p  )2  2(1 + p  )3.
in the extremal case and with all four charges chosen to be equal, qk = p , (3.33) reduces to the
equation studied in [70]. the characteristic coecient 2 in the mass term gives the eective potential
of the form l(l + 1)/r2 near the horizon, with l = 1. away from the horizon, the xed scalar equation
diers from that of the l = 1 partial wave of the ordinary scalar.

finally, let us note that there exist other representations of the 4-charge d = 4 black hole. for
example in the case of the 2255 representation [26], or, equivalently, the u-dual d = 4 con-
guration in the ns-ns sector with two (electric and magnetic) charges coming from the d = 10
antisymmetric tensor and two (electric and magnetic) charges being of kaluza-klein origin, we may
parametrize the metric as

ds2

10 = e24 dx2

4 + e25 dx2

5 + e2(dx2

6 + dx2

7 + dx2

8 + dx2

9) .

this leads to the eective lagrangian related to the above one (3.28) by a linear eld redenition and
re-interpretation of the charges. the potential is (cf. (3.29))

f (, 4, 5) = e2(q2

ke24 + q2e24 ) + e2(p 2

k e25 + p 2e25) ,

where  is the 4-d dilaton. this shows that the scale of the remaining 4-torus, , decouples.

3.3 eective string couplings

we now turn to a discussion of the eective action governing the absorption and emission of xed
scalars by the bound state of d1- and d5-branes. we use the same framework as the recent demon-
strations of agreement between gr and d-brane treatments of the absorption of generic decoupled
scalars [6, 7, 8, 73, 74]. we assume that: (i) the d = 5 black hole is equivalent to n1 d1-branes
bound to n5 d5-branes, with some left-moving momentum; (ii) that the low-energy dynamics of this
system is described by the dbi action for a string with an eective tension te, and (iii) that the
relevant bosonic oscillations of this eective string are only in the four 5-brane directions (i = 6, 7, 8, 9)
transverse to the 1-brane. these assumptions serve to specify the detailed couplings of external closed
string elds, in particular the xed scalars, to the d-brane degrees of freedom. this is an essential
input to any calculation of absorption and emission rates and, as we shall see, brings fairly subtle
features of the eective action into play.

specically, we assume that the low-energy excitations of our system are described by the standard

d-string action

i = tez d2 e10p det ab + ... ,

ab = g (x)ax bx  ,

(3.35)

where 10 and g are the d = 10 dilaton and string-frame metric. the specic dependence on 10
is motivated by the expected 1/gstr behavior of the d-string tension. the normalization constant of
the tension, te, is subtle and will be discussed later. our goal is to read o the couplings between
excitations of the eective string and the uctuations of the metric and dilaton that correspond to
the xed scalars.

it should be noted that the essential structure of the eective string action we are interested
in can be, at least qualitatively, understood using semi-classical eective eld theory methods. a
straightforward generalization of the extremal classical solution [82, 6] describing a bps bound state
of a string and 5-brane in which the string is localized on the 5-brane5 has the d = 10 string metric
5instead of talking about a bound state of several single-charged d-strings and d5-branes with coinciding centers,
it is sucient, at the classical level, to consider just a single string and a single 5-brane having charges q  n1 and
p  n5.

i ,
which corresponds to the extremal limit of the d = 5 black hole (3.14),(3.15) with qk = 0 (here we
consider the unboosted string). the presence of the 5-brane breaks the o(1, 1)o(8) symmetry of the
standard rr string solution down to o(1, 1)  o(4)  o(4). since the localized solution also breaks
4+4 translational invariances, the string soliton has 4+4 collective coordinates: x m(x5, t), x i(x5, t).
the corresponding o(4)  o(4) invariant eective string action thus should have the following form
in the static gauge,

i + x2

i =z d2[t0 + tkax iax i + tax max m + ...] .

the constants t0, tk, t can be determined using standard methods (see, e.g., [92]) by substituting
the perturbed solution into the d = 10 eective eld theory action, etc. t0 is proportional to the
adm mass of the background, t0  p + q. the same should be true also for t, t  p + q,
since x m describe oscillations of the whole bound state in the common transverse 4-space. at the
same time, tk is the eective tension of the string within the 5-brane, so that tk  q. in the special
cases p = 0 and q = 0 these expressions are in obvious agreement with the standard results for a
free string and a free 5-brane. in the case when p  q, i.e. n5  n1, we learn that t  tk, so
that oscillations of the string in the four directions x m transverse to the 5-brane can be ignored.6
if we further assume, following [72, 94], that the string lying within the 5-brane has the eective
length le  qp  n1n5, we nish with the following expression for the eective string tension in the
relevant directions parallel to the 5-brane: te  tk/le  1/p  1/n5. this picture is consistent
with that suggested in [72, 76] and will pass a non-trivial test below.
in accord with the assumption (iii), we thus drop terms involving derivatives of x m = x 1,2,3,4 (i.e.
motions in the uncompactied directions). we also eliminate two more string coordinates by choosing
the static gauge x 0 = 0, x 5 = 1 and write

ab  ab + ab = gab(x) + 2gi(a(x)b)x i + gij(x)ax ibx j .

(3.36)

we make the kaluza-klein assumption that the background elds 10 and g depend only on the
external coordinates xm  x m, m = 0, 1, ..., 5. since we are interested in linear absorption and
emission processes, we make a weak-eld expansion in powers of 10 and h  g   , splitting
hij into traceless and trace parts: hij = hij + 1
4 ijh. finally, we distinguish l and r string excitations
by introducing + = 0 + 1 ,  = 0 + 1. we can then use the formula

6one may also give the following argument in support of the claim that transverse oscillations of the string
can be ignored when the string is light compared to the 5-brane. the classical action for a d-string probe
moving in the above background produced by a bound state of r-r string and 5-brane has the following form:

) + b(r) + ...] (we shall set the world-sheet gauge eld to zero and choose
the static gauge). if the string is oriented parallel to the x5 direction of the 5-brane (a bps conguration), the non-
trivial part of the potential term cancels out [93]. the same is true for the dependence on the h1-function in the
2 h5(x)axmaxm + ...]. the function
it plays the

i1 = t0r d2[eq det(g + b(n s)
second-derivative terms which have the form i1 = t0r d2[1 + 1

thus determines the metric of the transverse part of the moduli space (see also [11]), i.e.

h5 = 1 + p
x2
m
role of an eective t which blows up when the string approaches the 5-brane. thus the string probe can freely move
within the 5-brane, but its transverse motions are suppressed.

the expansion has been organized in powers of derivatives of x i and we have kept terms at most linear

where  is the scale of the 4-torus part of the 5-brane (if gij = e2ij then, in the linearized ap-
proximation, hii = 8),  is the corresponding six-dimensional dilaton and  is the scale of the fth
(string) dimension measured in the six-dimensional einstein metric. these are the same three scalar
elds that appear in the gr eective action (3.7), (3.9).

since the kinetic terms in the eective action (3.7), (3.9) are diagonal in ,  and , we can
immediately read o some important conclusions from (3.39), (3.41). the expansion in powers of
world-sheet derivatives is a low-energy expansion and, of the elds we have kept, only the dilaton
 is coupled at leading order. it is also easy to see that the o-diagonal components of the metric
hij have the same coupling as  to lowest order in energy. (these are the elds whose emission and
absorption were considered in [7, 8, 73]). what is more interesting is that the scalar  only couples at
the next-to-leading order (fourth order in derivatives). note that its interaction term can be written
in terms of world-sheet energy-momentum tensors as t x
.7 the scalar  likewise does not get
emitted at the leading order and does couple at the same order as , but with a dierent vertex.8
the graviton components in the time and string directions h00 and h55 couple to the string in a
way similar to , which reects their mixing with  in the eective action (3.9). indeed, the vertex
(h00 + h55)(t x
++ + t x
) gives a vanishing contribution to the amplitude of production of a closed
string state:
it only couples a pair of left-movers or a pair of right-movers so that the production
is forbidden kinematically. the important (and non-trivial) point is that the simplest dbi action

7there is a similar coupling for  which produces a subleading correction to its emission rate.

for the coupling of the external elds to the d-brane gives the elds  and , previously identied
as the xed scalars, dierent (and weaker) couplings to the eective string than the elds like
 previously identied as decoupled scalars. the precise couplings will shortly be used to make
precise calculations of absorption and emission rates.

the action (3.37) is at best the bosonic part of a supersymmetric action. in previous discussions
of d-brane emission and absorption, it has been possible to ignore the coupling of external elds
to the massless fermionic excitations of the d-brane. for the questions that interest us, that will
no longer be possible and we make a specic proposal for the couplings of world-sheet fermions. in
the successful d-brane description of the entropy of rotating black holes [38, 95], ve-dimensional
angular momentum is carried by the fermions alone. there are two world-sheet fermion doublets,
one right-moving and one left-moving. the so(4) rotations of the uncompactied (1234) coordinates
are decomposed as su (2)l  su (2)r and the obvious (and correct) choice is to take the left-moving
fermions, sa, to be a doublet under su (2)l and the right-moving fermions, s a to be a doublet under
su (2)r. this set of fermions may be bosonized as two boson elds, 1 and 2. as mentioned above,
the next-to-leading terms in (3.40),(3.41) can be written in terms of the x-eld stress-energy tensor,

++ = (+ ~x)2 ,

. this will have a crucial eect on the normalization of the xed scalar absorption

3.4 semi-classical description of absorption

in this section we will mainly discuss the solution of the radial dierential equation one obtains for
s-wave perturbations in the xed scalar  related to the volume of the internal t 4 in string metric
(3.5). let us start by restating some results of section 3.2. from (3.8), (3.14) and (3.15) one can read
o the ve-dimensional einstein metric:

)2/3hdt2 + (h qh p h qk

3(cid:1) .
)1/3(cid:0)h1dr2 + r2d2

(3.44)

to avoid the mixing between gravitational perturbations and the xed scalar, we will restrict ourselves
to the case p = q, i.e. r1 = r5 = r, p 2 = r2(r2 + r2
0) (see (3.18)). the small uctuation equation,
(3.25), may be written as

(cid:20)(cid:0)hr3r(cid:1)2

the most ecient tool for obtaining the absorption cross-section is the ratio of uxes method used
in [75]. in all the cases we will treat, the solution to (3.45) whose near-horizon limit represents purely
infalling matter has the limiting forms

incoming wave. once the constant  is known, one can compute the ux for the incoming wave and
compare it to the ux for the infalling wave (3.47) to nd the absorption probability. in the present
instance, uxes are purely radial:

(3.49)

readers unfamiliar with the solution matching technology may be helped by the analogy to tunneling
through a square potential barrier in one dimension. if particles come from the left side of the barrier,
the wave function is to a good approximation a standing wave on the left side of the barrier, a
decreasing exponential inside the barrier, and a purely right moving exponential on the right side of
the barrier.

to obtain the familiar result abs = ah for low-energy, ordinary scalars falling into an extremal
black hole, it suces to match the limiting value of (3.47) for small y directly to the limiting value
of (3.48) for small r [71]. due to non-extremality and to the presence of the potential term in (3.45),
this naive matching scheme is invalid. a more rened approximate solution must be used, and a more
physically interesting low-energy cross-section will be obtained.

we will now present approximate solutions to (3.45) in two regimes most easily characterized in d-
brane terms: we shall rst consider tr = 0 with /tl arbitrary; then we shall consider tr much less
than tl but not zero, and allow /tr to vary arbitrarily. in [96] a more general case was considered:
/tl and /tr both arbitrary.

when tr = 0, the black hole is extremal: r0 = 0 and r = u. as usual, one proceeds by joining a
near horizon solution i to a far solution iii using an exact solution ii to the  = 0 equation [8, 73, 70].

9in fact there can be phase shifts in the arguments of the exponential in (3.47) and the bessel functions in (3.48),

but they are immaterial for computing uxes at leading order.

and  to be nonzero, but the changes in the nal solution do not aect the uxes fh and f (these
changes are however crucial in determining s0 by the old methods of [37], and give phase information
on the scattered wave which the ux method does not). having only c 6= 0 in region ii is analogous to
the fact that for right-moving particles incident on a square potential barrier, the wave function under
the barrier can be taken as a purely falling exponential with no admixture of the rising exponential.

from (3.56) and (3.53) the cross-section is immediate:

ment to the indicated order of accuracy. to obtain o(r2

would have to go beyond the dilute gas approximation. an interesting special case where these cor-
rections vanish is when tl = 0, corresponding to   . in the brane description, this corresponds
to 1-branes and 5-branes only with no condensate of open strings running between them: a pure
quantum state with no thermal averaging. the limiting forms of the gr result (3.57) and of the

3.5 d-brane absorption cross-sections and emission rates

in this section we give a detailed calculation of the emission and absorption of the xed scalar , using
the interaction vertices computed in section 3.3. we recall that  is related (see (3.5)) to the volume
(measured in the string metric) of the compactication 4-torus orthogonal to the string. to study the
leading coupling of , it is sucient to retain the following two terms in the string eective action (cf.

where we have absorbed te into the elds to make them properly normalized. from (3.7) we see
that the scalar eld with the proper bulk kinetic term is 2/5. consider the invariant amplitude

while q1 and q2 are the right-moving ones, the matrix element among properly normalized states is

(3.67)

the basic assumption of the d-brane approach to black hole physics is that the left-movers and
right-movers can be treated as thermal ensembles [6, 51]. strictly speaking, they are microcanonical
ensembles, but for our purposes the canonical ensemble is good enough and we proceed as if we
are dealing with a massless one-dimensional gas of left-movers of temperature tl and right-movers
with temperature tr. the motivation for this assumption has been explained at length in several
recent papers [6, 51, 75]. to compute the rate for the process scalar  l + l + r + r we have to
square the normalized matrix element (3.67) and integrate it over the possible energies of the nal
state particles. because of the presence of the thermal sea of left-movers and right-movers, we must
insert bose enhancement factors: for example, each left-mover in the nal state picks up a factor of
1 + l(pi) = l(pi), where

(3.68)

l(pi) =

1

pi

e

tl  1

is the bose-einstein distribution. if there were a left-mover of energy pi in the initial state, it would
pick up an enhancement factor l(pi). similar factors attach to right-movers.

conservation of energy and of momentum parallel to the eective string introduces the factor

where le is the length of the eective string. the factor of 36 = 62 arises from the presence of
six species of left-movers (four bosons and two bosonized fermions) and six species of right-movers.
we divide by 4 = 22 because of particle identity: because the two left-movers in the nal state are
identical particles, the integral over p1, p2 counts every left-moving nal state twice (similarly for the
right-movers).

to write down the rates for the three other absorptions processes (that is, processes 2, 3, and 4 in

eq. (3.1)), it is convenient to dene the integrals

the fractional coecients inside the square brackets on the second line of (3.72) are symmetry factors
for the nal states (the initial states are always simple enough so that their symmetry factors are unity).
it is remarkable that although the individual processes 14 have rates which cannot be expressed in
closed form, their sum is expressible in terms of integrals which can be performed analytically [98]
because they run over all p1, p2, q1, and q2.

a similar calculation may be performed for the four emission processes, with the result

emit() = e 

th abs() = abs() ,

(3.73)

where the hawking temperature characterizing the distribution of the emitted scalars is related to tr
and tl by (3.22). our convention has been to compute abs() assuming that the ux of the incoming
scalar is unity. we have also suppressed the phase space factor d4k/(2)4 for the outgoing scalar in
computing emit(), and we have assumed that the outgoing scalar is emitted into the vacuum state,
so that emit() includes no bose enhancement factors. these conventions were chosen because they
lead to simple expressions for emit() (3.73) and abs below, but they must be borne carefully in
mind when considering questions of detailed balance. suppose we put the black hole in a thermal
bath of scalars at temperature th. then abs() and emit() pick up bose enhancement factors
for the scalars: those factors are, respectively, 1/(e/th  1) and 1/(1  e/th ). once these factors
are included, the emission and absorption rates become equal by virtue of the rst equality in (3.73).
the fact that calculating emit() in the same way that we calculated abs() leads to (3.73) is a
nontrivial check on detailed balance. this check is analogous to verifying that qed reproduces the
einstein a and b coecients for the decay of the rst excited state of hydrogen.

because abs() was computed assuming unit ux, one would naively guess that the absorption
cross-section to be compared with a semi-classical calculation is abs = abs(). (now we are back to
the conventions where abs() and emit() do not include bose enhancement factors for the scalars).
this is not quite right; instead,

abs() = abs()  emit() = abs() + abs() .

(3.74)

to see why (3.74) is right, we have to remember what we are doing in a semi-classical computation.
we send in a classical wave in the eld whose quanta are the scalars of interest, and we watch to
see what fraction of it is sucked up by the black hole and what fraction is re-emitted. the quantum
eld theory analog is to send in a coherent state of scalars with large average particle number, so
that the ux is almost xed at its classical expectation value f . the dominant processes are then
absorption and stimulated emission. the bose enhancement factors collapse to f for both absorption
and emission, up to errors which are insignicant in the semi-classical limit. the net rate at which

32

particles are absorbed is then abs()f  emit()f . but this rate is absf by denition, whence
(3.74). note that the last expression in (3.74) is manifestly invariant under time-reversal, which takes
  .

in order to obtain denite results for the absorption cross-section, we must supply values for the
eective length le of the string, as well as its eective tension te. it is a by-now-familiar story that
multiple d-strings bound to multiple ve-branes behave like a single d-string multiply wound about
the compactication direction [72]. in the case at hand it is well-understood that the eective string
length is [72, 75]

with this substitution, the xed scalar  absorption cross-section becomes

this is similar to, but not quite the same as, the absorption cross-section for the ordinary unxed
scalar calculated in [75].

the object of our exercise is to oer further evidence that the d-brane conguration is the corre-
sponding black hole by showing that (3.76) is identical to the corresponding quantity calculated by
standard classical gr methods. for technical reasons, the gr calculation in a general black hole
background is quite dicult and the results we have been able to obtain (presented in section 3.4)
are only valid in certain simplifying limits. the most important simplication is to take equal brane
charges r1 = r5 = r.

first we consider the extremal limit, tr = 0. here (3.76) reduces to

and remembering that we were only able to do the classical calculation for r1 = r5 = r, we see that

where we have restored the dependence on  that we have been suppressing since (3.16). this value
for te is precisely equal to the tension of the fractionated d-string moving inside n5 5-branes
[72, 76]. this is a highly non-trivial independent check on the applicability of the eective string
model to xed scalars, and also on the idea of d-string fractionation!

another interesting comparison to be made is for near-extremal black holes. for , tr  tl but

with ratio of  to tr otherwise arbitrary, (3.76) becomes, using (3.79) for the tension,

this is in exact agreement with the absorption cross-section on non-extremal black holes (3.65) com-
puted using general relativity.

for the xed scalar the coupling to (x)2 is absent from the d-brane action, and the cross-section
we found is the leading eect. for an ordinary decoupled scalar, such as the 6-d dilaton, both terms
are present. so, the cross-section computed above should be part of the correction to the leading
eect determined in [75]. this is an interesting topic for future investigation.

3.6 conclusions

let us try to recapitulate in a few words what it has taken many equations to state. the main
thrust of the chapter has been to explore the behavior of the type of xed scalar studied earlier in
[64, 65, 69, 66, 67, 68], and most recently in [70]  but now in the context of ve-dimensional black
holes that can be modeled by bound states of d1-branes and d5-branes [5, 6, 72, 7, 8, 73, 99, 75]. for
the most part we have focused on the xed scalar  which corresponds to the volume of the internal
four-torus as measured by the string metric. through an interesting interplay between semi-classical
computations (where the basic theory is well known but analytically intractable in general) and d-
brane computations (where the theory is less well known but very tractable), we have arrived at a
general formula (3.76) for the cross-section for low-energy xed scalars to be absorbed into the black
hole.

the absorption cross-section (3.76) has a much richer and more interesting functional form than
the simple 2 dependence found in [70]. even in the simple limit , tr  tl in which comparison
calculations between gr and d-branes were initially performed [7, 8, 73], the xed scalar cross-section
goes not as 2 but as 2 + 2, where  = 2th is the surface gravity at the horizon. while we have
derived the expression (3.76) in full generality only in the d-brane picture, we have demonstrated that
it agrees with semi-classical calculations of the cross-section in the two regimes: one regime reproduces
this novel 2 + 2 behavior, while the other deals with absorption into extremal black holes. because
the equations for the gravitational perturbations and xed scalar perturbations couple unless two
of the three charges, e.g., the 1-brane charge and the 5-brane charge, are equal to each other, our
semi-classical computations are limited to the equal charge case (similar equal-charge assumption was
used in d = 4 case in [70]). modulo this limitation, we have condence that a full greybody factor
computation along the lines of [75] would reproduce the general result (3.76).

one of the reasons why the extension of the semi-classical calculations to unequal 1-brane and
5-brane charges (but with both still greater than the third charge, p, q  qk, to remain in the
dilute gas region) would be interesting, is that the d-brane computations involve one free parameter,
the tension te of the eective string, which can be read o from a comparison with a semi-classical
calculation. the expectation, based on the work of [72, 76] and on the arguments given at the
. our work conrms this relation when the 1-brane and
beginning of section 3.3, is that te =
5-brane charges are equal. what a semi-classical calculation with unequal charges should conrm is
that te is independent of the number of 1-branes.

2gn5

although our ultimate goal has been to demonstrate a new agreement between semi-classical gr
and a perturbative treatment of the eective string, we have along the way studied interesting facets
of both formalisms separately. on the d-brane side, we have been forced to go beyond the leading
quadratic terms in the expansion of the dbi action and examine terms quartic in the derivatives of the
string collective coordinate elds x i. as we argued in section 3.3, the generic form of the quadratic
terms is practically inevitable given the invariances of the problem. but the decoupling of the xed
scalar from quadratic terms and the precise form of its coupling to quartic terms is a signature of
the dbi action. the agreement between the d-brane and gr cross-sections for xed scalars is thus
a more stringent test of the dbi action than the agreements obtained previously [8, 73, 74, 75] for
ordinary scalars.

34

from the open string theory point of view, the (x)2 term in the d-string action (3.35),(3.37)
originates upon dimensional reduction from the f 2
 term in the d = 10 born-infeld action, while
the (x)4 terms correspond to the f 4
 -terms. it is amusing to note that the xed scalars, which
are coupled to the maxwell terms of the closed string vector elds in the spacetime eective action
(3.7), thus do not couple to the maxwell term of the open string vector eld in the eective d-string
action, while exactly the opposite is true for the decoupled scalars. it is thus the f 4
 -terms in the
dbi action (which are important also in some other contexts) that are eectively responsible for the
leading contribution to the cross-section of xed scalars.

at the relevant (x)4 order, the processes involving fermionic excitations of the eective string con-
tribute in the same way as purely bosonic processes. fortunately, the coupling of bosonic excitations
to the xed scalar eld predicted by the dbi action is of a particularly simple form, t x
(x),
which admits an obvious generalization to include fermions: t tot
(x). obtaining precise agree-
ment with gr using this coupling and the normalization of te as in [72, 76] may be viewed as
determining a partial supersymmetrization of the eective string action via d-brane spectroscopy.

++t tot

++t x

on the gr side, we have to some extent systematized the study of spherical black hole cong-
urations, including spherically symmetric perturbations around the basic d = 5 black hole with
three charges, by reducing the problem to an eective two-dimensional one. for time-independent
congurations, this gives a straightforward derivation of the basic black hole solution. we were dis-
appointed to nd, however, that, despite relative simplicity of the eective two-dimensional theory
compared to the full supergravity equations, it still leads to complicated coupled dierential equations
for time-dependent uctuations around the static solution. so far, we have been able to extract simple
equations from the intractable general case only when some pair of charges are equal. then the back-
ground value of one xed scalar becomes constant and its uctuations decouple from the other elds,
leading to a non-extremal ve-dimensional generalization of the equation studied in [70]. similar two-
dimensional eective theory techniques with similar equal charge limitations were applied to the basic
four-dimensional black hole with four charges. in this chapter, we have taken the four-dimensional
calculations only far enough to see that xed scalars whose background values become constant when
three of the four charges are equal have an absorption cross-section with the characteristic 2 + 2
dependence.

one nal comment is that we have focused almost exclusively on absorption rather than hawking
emission. this is not because hawking emission is any more dicult, but rather because agreement
between the semi-classical hawking calculation and the d-brane result is inevitable once a successful
comparison of absorption cross-sections is made. to see this, one must only note that detailed balance
between emission and absorption is built into the hawking calculation and that it can be checked
explicitly in the d-brane description. once detailed balance is established in both descriptions, it
obviously suces to check that the absorption cross-section agrees between the two in order to be
sure that emission rates must agree as well.

partial wave absorption by eective
strings

4.1

introduction

the d1-brane d5-brane bound state toroidally compactied down to ve dimensions has proven to be
one of the most fruitful string theoretic models of black holes. since the original paper of [6], which
proposed the model as a way to study black hole dynamics in a manifestly unitary string theoretic
framework, and the subsequent work in [72] clarifying the means by which a single multiply wound
eective string arises in a description of the low-energy dynamics, there have been many exciting
papers relating properties of ve-dimensional and four-dimensional black holes to the eective string.
an explanation of the near-extremal entropy was given in [6, 38, 95], following the ideas originally
laid out in [5]. absorption cross-sections and the corresponding hawking emission rates were worked
out in [7, 8, 73, 99, 75, 87, 21, 96, 100, 101] yielding impressive agreement at low energies with the
eective string model. suggestions that the eective string model may have some aws or limitations
have arisen in the work of [102, 103, 83].

in a recent paper by strominger and maldacena [100] it was found from a general analysis of
thermal two-point functions that the eective string seems capable of explaining the semi-classical
absorption cross-sections for arbitrary partial waves of ordinary scalars. subsequent work by mathur
[104] exhibited more detailed agreement between the eective string model and general relativity for
 = 0.
these processes. ordinary scalars are scalars whose equation of motion in ve-dimensions is
the canonical examples of ordinary scalars are the o-diagonal gravitons hij with both i and j lying
within the d5-brane but perpendicular to the d1-brane. these are the scalars for whose s-wave
cross-section full agreement between general relativity and the eective string was rst achieved in
[8].

the results of [100, 104] overlap substantially with [22], on which the present chapter is based. the
organization is as follows. section 4.2 covers the semi-classical analysis of partial wave absorption and
includes a derivation of a form of the optical theorem for the absorption of scalar particles which was
quoted without proof in [10]. section 4.3 presents the eective string description of the same processes,
exhibiting along the way a simple method for performing all the phase space integrals encountered in
[104]. in section 4.4, the limitation on the number of partial waves the eective string can couple to
arising from statistics and locality is compared with the limitation imposed semi-classically by cosmic
censorship. section 4.5 summarizes the results and indicates directions for further work.

4.2 the semi-classical computation

the quantity that can be conveniently computed using the matching technique is the absorption
probability. to convert this to an absorption cross-section, it is necessary to use properties of the
partial wave expansion in four spatial dimensions and to invoke the optical theorem. the details of
this connection were worked out independently in [104], but because the derivation given below applies
for arbitrary dimensions, it seems worthwhile to present it in full. in all of what follows, n = d  1
will denote the number of spatial dimensions.

the optical theorem for scattering of a scalar eld o a spherically symmetric potential states

that if the scattering wave-function has for large r the asymptotic form

(here x = r cos ), then the total cross-section is

to nd the partial wave expansion of (4.1), it is rst necessary to make a neumann expansion of the
exponential function, which can be done using gegenbauer polynomials [105]:

the expansion

using asymptotic properties of bessel functions, one can now write down the partial wave expansion
of (4.1) as

with these results in hand, let us proceed to the semi-classical computation of the cross-section for
an ordinary scalar  in the th partial wave to be absorbed into a black hole. it is hoped that this
piece of spectroscopic data will be illuminating of the form of the eective string action.

an ordinary scalar is one whose equation of motion is just the laplace equation following from the

black hole metric, which in ve dimensions is

one can extract from the laplace equation

(cid:2)(hr3r)2 + r6f 2  r4h( + 2)(cid:3) r = 0 .

(4.13)

because of the left-right symmetry of the eective string description for ve-dimensional black holes,
the absorption cross-section for the near-extremal case provides essentially no more information about
the eective string than the extremal case does.
in the interest of a simple presentation, we will
therefore restrict the calculations in both this section and the next to the extremal case. the near-
extremal generalizations of the results are summarized at the end of each section.

in the near horizon region (denoted i for consistency with the literature [37, 87, 21]), (4.13)
for an extremal black hole can be approximated by a coulomb equation [97] in the variable y =
(r1r5rk)/(2r2), while in the far horizon region iii it can be approximated as a bessel equation:

enters into the series expansion of coulomb functions.

a more accurate matching can be obtained with  6= 0, but the level of accuracy embodied in
(4.16) is sucient for the ux ratio method [75, 87, 21]. in this method, the absorption probability is
computed as the ratio of the infalling ux at the horizon to the ux in the incoming wave at innity.

4.3 the eective string analysis

despite recent progress in formulating superspace actions for branes [33, 34, 107] and in generaliz-
ing the dbi action to nonabelian gauge theory (see [108] and references therein), a rst-principles
derivation of a complete action for the eective string, including all couplings to elds in the bulk of
spacetime, has yet to be achieved. the goal of this section is to write down a reasonable form for the

39

part of the action responsible for coupling the eective string to higher partial waves of an ordinary
scalar and see how the cross-sections it predicts compare with the semi-classical result (4.19).

consider the o-diagonal graviton hij with i and j parallel to the d5-brane but perpendicular to
the d1-brane. the lowest-order interaction of this eld with excitations on the eective string can be
read o from the dbi action [8]: in static gauge where t =  and x5 = ,

vint = tez leff

0

d 2hij(, , ~x = 0)+x ix j .

(4.22)

the convention in (4.22) and elsewhere is to sum over all i 6= j. the elds hii couple somewhat
dierently; an exploration of those couplings and their physical consequences was initiated in [21].

in [76], an analysis of the entropy and temperature of near-extremal 5-branes led to an eective
5). an extension of the methods used in [76] to the case r1  r5

string with ce = 6 and te = 1/(2r2
leads to [109]

te =

1
1 + r2
2(r2
5)

.

(4.23)

the natural assumption is that te , by denition the tension that appears in front of the dbi action,
is precisely te. strangely enough, all previous scattering calculations except the xed scalar compu-
tation of [83] (whose implications regarding the eective string tension are unclear as yet) either do
not depend on te or require r1 = r5. thus, purely from the point of view of scattering computations,
te seems ambiguous by a factor of the form f (r1/r5) where f (1) = 1. one of the motivations for
studying higher partial waves is to resolve this ambiguity. the result we will obtain is

te =

1

2r1r5

.

(4.24)

because of the evaluation of hij at ~x = 0, (4.22) is a coupling to the s-wave of hij only. how might it
be generalized to include the dominant couplings to arbitrary partial waves? to begin with, a coupling
to the th partial wave should include  derivatives of hij since the wave-function vanishes like |~x|.
it is the fermions on the eective string which carry the angular momentum [38, 95]: the left-moving
and right-moving fermions transform in a fundamental of su (2)l and su (2)r respectively, where the
so(4) of rotations in the four non-compact spatial dimensions is written as so(4) = su (2)lsu (2)r.
purely on group theory grounds, one thus expects the th partial wave to couple to  left-moving and 
right-moving fermions. the order of the absorption process in the string coupling can be read o from
(4.19) as g+1 where g is the closed string coupling. exactly two more open string vertex operators
should be included in the interaction to make the disk diagram come out with this power of g. the
natural candidate for the interaction is

vint = tez leff

d 2

x=0

yk=1

mk ! m1  mhij(, , xm = 0) +x ix j .

(4.25)

extra derivatives on the fermion elds are possible a priori, but power counting in  for /tl  1
shows that they must be absent if (4.19) is to be reproduced. the same general form of the coupling
was deduced independently in [100] through a greybody factor analysis.

the outstanding fallacy of (4.25) is that the sum terminates at  = 4 because there are only four
types of left-moving fermions and the same number of right-moving fermions. the situation is even
worse when one factors in the restrictions from so(4) group theory. as we shall see after (4.29), only
the  = 0 and  = 1 partial waves can be absorbed.

i being the usual pauli matrices. we follow northwest contraction conventions for raising and lowering
spinor indices, and we set 01 = 01 =  0 1 =  0 1 = 1. the four-component spinor  decomposes into
su (2)l and su (2)r fundamentals, which are left-movers and right-movers on the eective string,
respectively. these complex fermions decompose further into real components of the 10-dimensional
majorana-weyl spinor that one would expect to emerge most simply from a full string theory analysis:

note that complex conjugation raises or lowers a spinor index, rather than dotting or undotting it as
in the case of so(3, 1).

for   2 the th term in the interaction (4.25) makes subleading contributions to the absorption
of lower partial waves because the expression m1  mhij does not pick out a pure th partial wave
from a plane wave. the cure for this is to symmetrize su (2)l and su (2)r spinor indices:

terms have been omitted in (4.29) which make subleading contributions. the product of fermion
elds is antisymmetric in 1 . . .  and in 1 . . . . hence all terms in (4.29) vanish except  = 0 and
 = 1. the conclusion is that only the rst two partial waves can be absorbed. this limitation is not
merely a failing of the specic form (4.25); it is intrinsic to the approach of coupling partial wave to
a product of fermion elds evaluated at a single point on the eective string without derivatives. to
reiterate, the addition of derivatives introduces extra powers of the energy in the nal cross-section
which would cause disagreement with (4.19). let us proceed with the analysis of  = 1 and consider
possible extensions to   2 later.

there are many steps involved in passing from the interaction (4.29) to the cross-section for  = 1.
to avoid losing factors it pays to be as explicit as possible. let us begin with mode expansions of
the elds appearing in (4.29). the forms of mode expansions are dictated by the kinetic terms in the
action. in the present case, the kinetic terms are

it is important that hij is moded dierently in the x5 direction from the eective string excitations:
the minimal quantum of kaluza-klein charge for an excitation on the eective string is 1/(n1n5) of
the minimal quantum for a particle in the bulk [94, 72]. in (4.31) we have not been careful about
zero modes because it is the oscillator states which are important for the absorption processes. the
factors in (4.31) were chosen to make the commutation relations simple:

if i < j and f < h .

(4.32)

the goal now is to compute the amplitude h f|vint|ii for an absorption process where a scalar in
the  = 1 partial wave turns into two bosons and two fermions on the eective string. the tildes
on |ii and | fi are meant to indicate that these state vectors are not the real initial and nal states:
they include only the particles that participate in the interaction and not the whole thermal sea of
left-movers that give the eective string its kaluza-klein charge. restoring the thermal sea is an easy
exercise which will be postponed until (4.39).

two other slight simplications will be made to ease the notational burden. first, indices can be
dropped on all the x i elds, but then one must include an extra factor of 2 in the rate, as shown in
(4.35). the 2 accounts for the fact that hij can turn into a left-moving x i and a right-moving x j or
a left-moving x j and a right-moving x i. the second simplication is to consider only

|ii = gk|0i

(4.33)

which is to say we put all the particles on the eective string into the nal state and none into the
initial state. a simple way to account for all the crossed processes which also contribute to absorption
will be discussed after equation (4.42). in (4.33) and below, k refers to the momentum of the bulk
scalar, p refers to the momentum of a left-mover on the eective string, and q refers to the momentum
of a right-mover.

and similarly for the right-moving thermal occupation factors. again, the explicit factor of 2 in the
rst line of (4.35) is present to account for the two distinct choices, i+ j or i j+, for polarizing
the bosonic elds.

the vanishing of all cross-sections beyond  = 1 is an egregious failing of the most naive eective
string model. the simplest x would be to allow an incoming scalar to couple to a product of fermion
elds evaluated at a single point on the spatial s1 which the eective string wraps, but not necessarily
at a single point in the eective string coordinates . in terms of the (4,4) scft from which the
eective string emerges as a particular twisted sector, this more general coupling seems very natural
because it still involves only a local operator constructed from a product of the 4n1n5 species of
fermions in the scft.

the present treatment extends easily to cover this more general interaction. let dk and dk be
4n1n5-valued indices for the left- and right-moving fermion elds, respectively. consider the nal

and similarly for ir. (scalar  bl + br + fl + fr) is what was computed in (4.39). arbitrary
crossings of the basic process scalar  bl + br + fl + fr and their time-reversals also contribute
to the net absorption rate from which abs is computed. however, the simple trick of extending the
integrals in (4.42) over the entire real line can be used to keep track of all of them. a demonstration
of this with careful attention paid to symmetry factors can be found in chapter 3 for the special
case where only two left-moving bosons and two right-moving bosons are involved. for  = 0 the
dependence on te disappears in (4.41), as was noted in chapter 3.

the integral (4.42) is a convolution of  + 1 simple functions and so can be done most directly by
transforming to fourier space, where convolutions become products. three integrals which are useful
for doing the fourier transforms are

finally, it is worth noting that if agreement can be established for extremal absorption, agreement

absorption one must subtract o the stimulated emission contribution as described in chapter 3 in
order to respect detailed balance and time reversal invariance. modulo this subtraction, the result

(4.51)

the same tension (4.48) and the same relation (4.49) establish agreement between (4.50) and (4.20).
it has been suggested [106] that the eective string picture can be used to describe in a u-duality
invariant fashion black holes with arbitrary charges, possibly even far from extremality. the expression
on the rst line of (4.50) depends only only tl, tr, th, and leall quantities that have meaning to
the eective string considered in the abstract, independent of the microscopic d1-d5-brane model. it
cries out to be reconciled with (4.20) for arbitrary values of r0, q1, q5, and qk. but the treatment of
absorption given in this section relies on the dilute gas approximation and thus is not general enough
to be matched in any meaningful way to general relativity when qk / q1, q5.

4.4 limitations on partial wave absorption

consider the more general couplings described in the paragraph preceding (4.37):
local on spatial
s1 wrapped by the eective string but not on the eective string itself.1 although the details of the
so(4) group theory and chan-paton factors have yet to be worked out fully in the context of the (4,4)
scft description of the d1-d5-brane bound state, it seems clear that a coupling of the th partial
wave to an operator built out of any combination of the 4n1n5 fermionic elds raises the maximum
value of  which the eective string can absorb from 1 to some number on the order n1n5. one
might suppose that by putting derivatives on some of the fermion elds, the problem can be avoided
altogether. but such derivatives raise the dimension of the operator and hence suppress the cross-
section by more powers of  than are present in the semi-classical result. to sum up, the assumption
of locality prevents the eective string from coupling to partial waves above a certain maximum  with
the strength required to match general relativity. the situation does not seem as satisfactory as for
the d3-brane, where couplings to all partial waves exist with appropriate dimensions to reproduce
semi-classical cross-sections [9] (normalizations however are problematic, as we shall see in chapter 6).
there is a reason, however, why one might expect not to observe agreement between the eective
string and general relativity at high values of . if the black hole absorbs some very high partial
wave, it winds up with a large angular momentum, so the geometry before and after is appreciably
dierent. back reaction is not included in the general relativity calculations of section 4.2. in fact

1the ideas in this section originate largely in discussions with c. callan, l. thorlacius, and j. maldacena.

46

the only back reaction calculation to date for the black hole under consideration [110] is restricted to
 = 0. but on the grounds of cosmic censorship one would expect that absorption processes which
drive the black hole past extremality are forbidden even semi-classically. from an adaptation of the

nkn1n5.

work of [38, 95] one can read o the corresponding bound on  as  <

we have two dierent bounds on  indicating the maximum partial wave that the eective string

should be capable of absorbing:

 < l
 < c

max  n1n5
max  nkn1n5

from locality and statistics

from cosmic censorship.

(4.52)

now we would like to inquire which is the more restrictive. using the standard relations (see for
example [99])

n1n5 =

43r2

2
5l5

nk =

(4.53)

and the formula (4.47) for tl, one can show that c

max/l

max = l5tl/2.

the validity of any comparison between general relativity and the eective string model as treated

in section 4.3 relies on being in the dilute gas regime [6] and at low energies [111]:

rk  r1, r5  1/ .

(4.54)

these inequalities still do not determine whether l
agreed to examine only fat black holes [72], which is to say if one assumes

max is larger or smaller than c

max. but if it is

then it is easy to obtain the inequality

l5  r1r5 ,

l
max  c

max

(4.55)

(4.56)

max and c

by combining the dilute gas inequality in (4.54) with (4.55). now, (4.56) is a hopeful state of aairs
for the eective string model, because it indicates that making couplings local only on s1 in principle
enables the eective string to absorb all the partial waves for which reasonable comparisons can be
made with general relativity.
it is perhaps not the ideal state of aairs: one might have hoped
that the bounds l
max would coincide, indicating that the eective string knew about cosmic
censorship. the results of [100] suggest that a more careful treatment of these issues using techniques
of conformal eld theory would result in a translation of cosmic censorship into unitarity of the
eective string description. such a treatment would need to address the problem that if one moves
deep into the black string region of parameter space by making l5 large, one can obtain l
max.
the perturbative d-brane region is in fact closer to the black string region than the fat black hole
region, so it would be surprising to nd such a disaster for comparisons in the black string region
when agreement seems possible for fat black holes.

max  c

4.5 conclusion

in this chapter we have shown that the leading order coupling of the eective string to an ordinary
scalar correctly predicts the cross-sections for the  = 1 partial wave. due to the grassmannian
character of the fermionic elds which carry the angular momentum, it is impossible for the simplest
eective string model (a single long string with ce = 6) to couple properly to  > 1 partial waves
through an operator local on the string. generalizing the model to include what one might intuitively

regard as multi-strand interactions of the eective string postpones this diculty to  > n1n5, a

higher bound on  for fat black holes than the one arising from cosmic censorship. an analysis of the
unique form which such interactions must have in order to make a leading order contribution to the

47

absorption of the th partial wave demonstrates that the correct energy dependence arises from the
nite temperature kinematics. this demonstration, together with the general proof of the optical
theorem for absorption of scalars given in section 4.2, can be viewed as a full investigation of the
and
kinematics involved in higher partial waves. what is left is to calculate the coecients c
thereby verify or falsify (4.49), on which agreement between general relativity and the eective string
model relies.

d1... d
d1...d

the means to achieve a clear description of the dynamics and hopefully a derivation of the c

d1... d
d1...d
is a more precise treatment of the low-energy scft dictating the dynamics of the d1-d5-brane
bound state. the eective string might continue to be a useful picture, perhaps supplemented by
rules governing how dierent strands of the eective string interact.
in a way the nding that the eective string tension needs to scale as 1/q1q5 is a more serious
diculty than the vanishing of  > 1 cross sections. indeed, the necessity of choosing this peculiar
value for the tension appears already at  = 1, where the naive eective string model in other ways
seems completely adequate. a study of t-duality in [104] led to the conclusion that a tension scaling as
1/q1q5 is more natural than 1/q1 or 1/q5, and it was further described how a simple modication
in the calculation of disk diagrams would lead to such a scaling. however, in the absence of a rst-
principles derivation of the tension, a 1/(q1 + q5) scaling seems equally natural. this scaling is the
one favored by entropy and temperature arguments. thus it appears that a single energy scale does
not fully characterize eective strings in the way that  does fundamental strings.

although eective string models of black holes have recently enjoyed a number of remarkable
successes, a unifying picture has been slow in emerging. the general relativity calculations for near-
extremal black holes, on which most of the evidence for eective strings is based, are conceptually
straightforward. the diculty of studying bound states of solitons has caused the link between funda-
mental string theory and eective strings to remain imprecise in certain respectsmost importantly
in the interaction between the eective string and elds in the bulk of spacetime.

the puzzles presented by higher partial waves may push eective string theory in the directions it
needs to go in order to become a fully viable model of near-extremal black holes. discrepant results
for the tension may be a clue to nature of eective strings interactions with bulk elds. rescuing the
 > 1 cross-sections must surely lead to a consideration of the multi-strand interactions which are as
yet virgin territory in the theory of eective strings. already, the absorption of higher partial waves
into ve-dimensional black holes is the cleanest dynamical test of the role of fermions on the eective
string. achieving a full understanding of these processes would constitute a major advance, not only
in establishing the viability of eective strings in black hole physics, but also in comprehending the
d1-d5-brane bound state.

photons and fermions falling into
four-dimensional black holes

5.1

introduction

microscopic models of near-extremal black holes in terms of eective strings have recently been em-
ployed with great success to explain the bekenstein-hawking entropy [5, 6, 54, 51, 72]. these models
have also proven their value by correctly predicting certain hawking emission rates and absorption
cross-sections at low energies [7, 8, 73, 99, 87, 21, 103, 102, 110, 112, 101, 75, 100, 113, 114].

the many successful predictions have all been for scalar particles. most in fact have been for
minimally coupled scalars. usually it is said that minimally coupled scalars are those whose equation
 = 0. this is a slight misnomer: a more precise way to say it is that when the equations
of motion is
of motion are linearized in small uctuations around the black hole solution under consideration, one of
 = 0. fortunately, it is usually easy to see which scalars in the theory are minimally
them is simply
coupled: for example, when one obtains a 5-dimensional black hole by toroidally compactifying the
d1-brane d5-brane bound state, the o-diagonal gravitons with both indices lying within the d5-
brane but perpendicular to the d1-brane are clearly minimally coupled scalars in the 5-dimensional
theory.

this chapter, based on the paper [23], presents a study of particles with nonzero spin falling into
eective string black holes. as a starting point, it is easiest to consider minimally coupled photons or
fermions. for photons, minimally coupled means that the relevant linearized equation of motion is

and for chiral fermions it means

f  = 0 ,

 
  = 0 .

(5.1)

(5.2)

minimally coupled fermions in arbitrary dimensions were studied in [71]. the authors of [71] correctly
point out that the fermions in supergravity theories do not in general obey minimally coupled equations
of motion in the presence of charged black holes. likewise, it is not usually the case that photons will
be minimally coupled in the presence of a supergravity black hole solution. indeed, it seems that the
gauge elds which carry the charges of the black hole are never minimally coupled: there is mixing
between them and the graviton.

however, for the case we shall study in this chapter, namely the equal charge black hole [59] of
n = 4 supergravity [115, 116, 117, 118], two of the four weyl fermions are in fact minimally coupled,
as are four of the six gauge elds. the same black hole provided the simplest framework in which

to study xed scalars [70]. its metric is that of an extreme reissner-nordstrom black hole. in [100]
it was shown that an eective string model is capable of reproducing the minimally coupled scalar
cross-section of the kerr-newman metric, in the near-extremal limit. the eective string picture
carries over naturally to the equal charge extreme black hole in n = 4 supergravity and its near-
extremal generalization. the recent work [114] presents evidence that the eective string can model
a much broader class of black holes which have arbitrary u (1) charges and are far from extremality.
the essential features of the eective string, however, seem much the same in all its four-dimensional
applications. we will show that minimally coupled fermions can be incorporated naturally into the
eective string picture through a coupling to the supercurrent. minimally coupled photons t in in a
somewhat unexpected way: the coupling of the gauge eld to the string seems to occur via the eld
strength rather than the gauge potential.

the organization of this chapter is as follows. in section 5.2, the black hole solutions are exhibited
and the minimally coupled photons are identied.
in section 5.3, separable equations are derived
for these photons. in section 5.4, these equations are solved to yield absorption cross-sections. the
parallel analysis of minimally coupled fermions is postponed to section 5.5, in which also the axion
cross-section is computed. the axion turns out to have the same cross-section as the dilaton, not
because it is a xed scalar in the usual sense of attractors [66, 67], but because of a dynamical version
of the witten eect [119]. section 5.6 discusses the eective string interpretation of these cross-
sections. although the overall normalizations of the cross-sections are not computed, it is shown that
the eective string correctly reproduces the relative normalization of the dilaton, axion, and minimal
fermion cross-sections. some concluding remarks are made in section 5.7. the appendix presents
some results of the dyadic index formalism needed for the rest of the chapter.

a crucial property of (5.7) and (5.9), without which there will be no minimally coupled photons,
is the vanishing of the dilaton. this happens only when q = p . the situation is similar to the case
of xed scalars, where the q = p case [70] was much easier to deal with than the q 6= p case [83].

appear in all the equations of motion because the background values of f3 and g3 are nonzero. but
because f1, f2, g1, and g2 do have vanishing background values (as does the axion b) the variations
of these gauge elds appear in the linearized equations only as

when the equations (5.5) are linearized around the solution (5.9), the variations f

where f = f1, f2, g1, or g2. including e2 in (5.12) was unnecessary since it is identically 1
when the charges are equal; but (5.12) is still the right linearized equation of motion for these elds
when the charges are unequal (provided the background value of the axion remains zero). surprisingly
enough, a non-constant dilaton background makes it much more dicult to decouple the equations
for dierent components of the gauge eld.

5.3 separable equations for gauge elds

having shown that minimally coupled gauge elds do indeed exist, let us now show how to solve their
equations of motion. the dilaton background will be kept arbitrary just long enough to observe why
it makes the job much harder. the goal of this section is to convert maxwells equations

into decoupled separable dierential equations. the equation of motion for the vector potential a,

df = 0

d  e2f = 0

(5.13)

d  e2da = 0 ,

(5.14)

does not lend itself to this task. it turns out to be easier to dispense with a altogether and analyze
maxwells equations, (5.13), directly. even this is quite challenging if one sticks to the traditional
tools of tensor analysis. fortunately, several authors [120, 121, 122] in the 60s and 70s worked out an
elegant approach to this sort of problem using penroses dyadic index formalism [123]. appendix a
provides a summary of some of the standard notation.

the eld strength f (six real quantities) is replaced by a symmetric matrix  (three complex

quantities) using the equation

now dene 1, 0, and 1 as follows:

f 

 

  =    +    .


1 = 00 = f m
0 = 10 = 01 = 1
1 = 11 = f mn

2 f (n + mm)

(5.15)

(5.16)

where , n, m, and m form the complex null tetrad (see the appendix). in the literature, it is
more common to write 0, 1, and 2 instead of 1, 0, and 1. the present convention has the
advantage that the subscript is essentially the helicity.

the bianchi identity df = 0 can be rewritten as d 

can rewrite the equation of motion d  e2f = 0 as

 = d   

. using this identity one

d 

 = 1

2 ( e2)(

  + 

 ) .

(5.17)

one immediately sees that the equations simplify greatly if the coupling e2 = 1. if this is not the
case, then because the right hand side involves    as well as , the advantage of compressing the
real eld strength components into complex components of  is lost. in this case, it seems dicult
to decouple the equations. it is striking that the condition for maxwells equations to be simple is the
same as the condition found in [70] and in chapter 3 for the xed scalar equation to decouple from
einsteins equations.

let us proceed with the case where e2 = 1, so that maxwells equations can be succinctly written

as d  = 0. the spin coecients for the general spherically symmetric metric,

ds2 = e2a(r)dt2  e2b(r)dr2  e2c(r)(cid:0)d2 + sin2 d2(cid:1)

are presented in (5.114). six of them vanish, and the remaining six can be expressed in terms of , ,
and , which are real. maxwells equations written out in components therefore take on a particularly
simple form:

(5.18)

(  2 + )1 = 0

(d  2)0 = (  2)1
( + 2)0 = (  2)1

(d + 2  )1 = 0 .

52

(5.19)

the form of maxwells equations in a more general metric can be found in [123].

a straightforward generalization of the preceding treatment can be given for elds of arbitrary

nonzero spin. the simplest lorentz covariant wave equation for a massless eld of spin n/2 is

d1 1...n = 0

(5.20)

where 1...n is symmetric in all its indices. the case n = 1 gives the weyl fermion equation. the
case n = 2 is, as we have seen, maxwells equations in vacuum. the case n = 4 can be obtained by
linearizing pure gravity around minkowski space, as discussed in section 5.7 of [124]. the case n = 3
can be obtained in minkowski space from the massless rarita-schwinger equation, as follows. the
constraint  = 0 is imposed on the rarita-schwinger eld

!
 =    

   



(5.21)

to project out the spin-1/2 components. this constraint is equivalent to making   symmetric in
its two undotted indices. in the supergravity literature, the equation of motion is usually written as
5 = 0 where  =   . the original paper by rarita and schwinger [125] (see
also p. 323 of [126]) proposes / = 0 as the equation of motion. using the constraint one can show
that both are equivalent to    = 0. as a result, the eld strength

 =  





(5.22)

is symmetric in all its indices and obeys the n = 3 case of (5.20).

although the cases n = 3 and n = 4 of (5.20) are not in general the correct curved-space equations
of motion for the gravitino and graviton, and although for n > 2 there are problems dening local,
gauge-invariant number currents and stress-energy tensors, still a brief investigation of (5.20) serves
to illustrate some of the general features one expects for elds of higher spin. furthermore, the near-
minkowskian limit of the equations we will derive should be close in form to the actual graviton and
gravitino equations far from a black hole.

dene helicity components s according to

then (5.20) can be written out in components. there are 2n equations:

(5.24) relating s and s1 into decoupled second order equations for s and s1 separately. in this

for all values of s, positive and negative. it is interesting to note that there is no explicit dependence
on the spin n/2 of the particle in (5.29), only on its helicity s. in practice we will mainly be interested
in the equations for  n
since these are the only components that can be radiative. the fact that
the equations for these radiative elds are identical to equations obeyed by non-radiative components
of elds of higher spin suggests that mixing of dierent spins is possible. such mixing between
photons and gravitons was observed by chandrasekhar in his analysis of perturbations of the reissner-
nordstrom black hole [127].

equations similar to (5.29) were worked out for the kerr metric by teukolsky [120, 121]. in that
case, only the equations for the radiative elds turned out to be separable. but in the present context,
spherical symmetry makes the separability of (5.29) trivial: the general solution is

where ysm is a spin-weighted spherical harmonic [128] and rs(r) satises the ode

the minimal value of  is |s|. in the case of photons,   1 indicates that the elds of lowest moment
that can be radiated are dipole elds. for fermions, , s, and m are all half-integer.

5.4 semi-classical absorption probabilities

returning now to the case of photons, let us investigate how an absorption cross-section can be
extracted from a solution to (5.31). section 5.4.1 derives a formula for the absorption probability. in
section 5.4.2 matching solutions are exhibited and absorption probabilities calculated for the black
holes (5.7) and (5.9).

54

5.4.1 probabilities from energy uxes

for the photon as for other elds of spin greater than 1/2, there is no gauge-invariant number current
  for spin 0 and j =  for spin 1/2. in order to count the photons
analogous to j = 1
2i
falling into the black hole, it is therefore necessary to examine the energy ux through the horizon and
adjust for the gravitational blueshift that the infalling photons experience. the stress-energy tensor
can be written in terms of 1, 0, and 1:
4 gf 2 + f f

 = 2     

t  = 1

=h|1|2nn + 2|0|2((n) + m( m)) + |1|2
 4 10n(m)  4 01(m) + 21 1mmi + c.c.

(5.32)

consider a sphere s2 located anywhere outside the horizon. taking into account the blueshift factor
as described, the number of photons passing through s2 in a time interval [0, t] is

n =

zs2[0,t]

(ttrdr) =

where vols2 = sin d  d, and

is essentially the radial photon number ux.

f = eab+2c ttr = e2a+2c(cid:0)|1|2  |1|2(cid:1) = | 1|2  | 1|2

(5.33)

(5.34)

the goal now is to nd an approximate solution to (5.29) for photons whose wavelength is much
longer than the size of the black hole, and to extract from it an absorption probability and cross-
section. the dominant contribution to this absorption comes from dipole elds.

far from the black hole, (5.31) for dipole elds simplies to

(5.37)

it is clear from (5.37) that 1 is the radiative component of the eld for outgoing waves, while 1 is
the radiative component for ingoing waves.

the boundary conditions at the horizon [121] require the radial group velocity to point inward. it
can be shown that 1 remains nite at the horizon while 1 vanishes. normalizations are xed by

55

requiring | 1|2  sin2  at the horizon. the net ux of photons into the black hole can be computed
in two ways:

at the horizon: fh = | 1|2 =  sin2 
at innity:

f = f out

 + f in

 = | 1|2  | 1|2 = 4(cid:0)|b|2  |a|2(cid:1) sin2  .

(5.38)

the two must agree, fh = f, and so |a|2 = |b|2 + 1/4. one can thus easily perceive the equivalence
of the two common methods for computing the absorption probability. the rst examines the decit
in the outgoing ux compared to the ingoing ux:

while the second simply compares the ux on the horizon to the ingoing ux at innity:

1  p = f out

f in


= |b|2
|a|2 ,

p = fh
f in


=

1

4|a|2 .

(5.39)

(5.40)

for low-energy photons, the absorption probability is small and a and b are large and nearly equal,
so from a calculational point of view the second method is to be preferred over the rst. indeed, it
will be standard practice in the matching calculations of later sections to ignore the small dierence
between a and b and simply set them equal. this approximation suces when (5.40) is used.

finally, to obtain the absorption cross-section from the probability, the optical theorem is needed.
averaging over polarizations is unnecessary in view of the spherical symmetry of the background. the
result for photons in a dipole wave is

(5.41)

5.4.2 matching solutions

abs =

2 p .

the work of previous sections can be boiled down to a simple prescription for computing the absorption
probability and cross-section to leading order in the energy for minimally coupled photons falling into
a spherically symmetric black hole. the probability can be obtained by solving (5.31) with  = 1
and s = 1, subject to the boundary condition r(r)  eif (r) as r approaches the horizon, f (r) being
some real decreasing function of r. far from the black hole, one will nd r(r)  2aeir, and the
probability is then given by

a matching solution can be pieced together as usual from a near region (i), an intermediate region (ii),
and a far region (iii). in the near region, (5.44) is simplied by setting to zero all terms containing

56

explicit factors of m . the intermediate region solution is obtained from (5.43) with  = 0. in the

because the solution (5.7) preserves a quarter of the supersymmetry, it is clearly of interest to compare
cross-sections of particles with dierent spins related by the unbroken supersymmetry. the other
particles in n = 4 supergravity whose cross-sections are straightforward to compute are the dilaton,
the axion, and those fermions which obey the weyl equation. the dilaton has been dealt with at
length in the xed scalar literature [70, 96, 83]. the axion in fact is also a xed scalar, as section
5.5.1 will show. of the four massless fermions, two are minimally coupled. the purpose of section
5.5.2 is to demonstrate this fact and to compute the minimal fermion cross-section. for comparison
with (5.53) let us quote here the nal results:

where  = /(4t ), as in (5.53). note that in the extremal limit the bosonic and fermionic absorption
probabilities quoted in (5.54) coincide.1

5.5.1 the axion

the strategy for deriving the linearized equation of motion for the axion is the same as the one used
in [70] for the dilaton: only spherical perturbations of the solution (5.9) are considered, and a gauge
is chosen where the only components of the metric that uctuate are grr and gtt. the minimally
coupled gauge elds f1, f2, g1, and g2 do not aect the linearized axion equation because they have
no background value and enter into the axion equation quadratically. spherical symmetry dictates
that only tr and  components of these eld strengths can uctuate, corresponding respectively to
radial electric and radial magnetic eld uctuations. these uctuations are constrained further by
gauss law (5.8):

the asymmetry between f3 and g3 arises because the black hole is electrically charged under f3 and
magnetically charged under g3. the axion b is a dynamical theta-angle for the gauge elds, so the
last relation in (5.55) should be viewed as a dynamical version of the witten eect [119]: when the

1similar results on the agreement of absorption probabilities due to residual supersymmetry have appeared elsewhere
in the literature [129, 130] for the case of n = 2 supergravity. see also [131]. thanks to g. horowitz and a. peet for
bringing these papers to my attention.

axion uctuates, an object that was magnetically charged picks up what seems like an electric charge
in that there are radial electric elds.

using (5.55) and ignoring the dilaton terms in the axion equation of (5.5) (which is valid for the
purpose of deriving the linearized axion equation because the dilaton has zero background value), one
obtains

(5.56)

this is indeed identical to the linearized equation for the dilaton, although the mass term for the
dilaton receives equal contributions 2q2 + 2p 2 from the electric and magnetic charges in place of the
4p 2 we see in (5.56).

the radial equation for b and  is

by an analysis suciently analogous to the treatments in [70, 96] that it seems superuous to present
the details, one obtains the result already quoted in (5.54):

p = (r0)2(1 + 42)

abs = r2

0(1 + 42) .

(5.58)

5.5.2 minimally coupled fermions

it was shown in [118] that the complete fermionic equations of motion for simple n = 4, d = 4
supergravity take on a simple form when written in terms of the supercovariant derivatives introduced
in [117]. the relevant one of these equations for spin-1/2 fermions is

i /di  3
where d denotes a supercovariant derivative.2

2 e2( /db)i = 0 ,

(5.59)

supercovariant derivatives in general can be read o from the supersymmetry variations of a eld:
. thus the supercovariant derivative of the axion is db =
if f = fi i , then df = df  1
b + (two fermion terms). again, terms in the equations of motion which are quadratic in elds with
zero background value do not contribute to the linearized rst-varied equations of motion. because
the background values of the axion as well as all fermions are zero for the solution (5.9), the second
term in (5.59) can be discarded.

4 fi i

a further simplication of (5.59) can be made by dropping terms from /di which are quadratic

in elds with zero background value. the supersymmetry variation of i is

plus terms which vanish for the solution (5.9). so

i = 2(f 3

2the spinor and gamma matrix conventions conventions used here are those described in appendix a of [59]. i
is a chiral spinor with 5i = i which replaces the majorana spinor i of [118]. the gravitinos are also written in
terms of chiral spinors i
. i runs from 1 to 4. conversion to these conventions from those of [118] is
discussed in [59]. it is worth adding that in the current conventions, each eld is identied with k times its counterpart
in [118], and for notational simplicity k is then set equal to 1/2. with this choice of the gravitational constant,  and
i are not canonically normalized; rather, they are twice the canonically normalized elds. so for example the kinetic
term of  in (5.3) is 2()2 rather than the canonical 1

 with 5i

(5.63)

for i = 3 and 4, the gravitino part gets killed and (5.59) is nothing but the weyl equation (5.2). for
i = 1 and 2, the gravitino mixes in.3

the key point in this analysis is that the supersymmetry transformation (5.60) leaves two of the
i invariant no matter what j is chosen to be. in view of the form of (5.59) and the prescription
for reading o supercovariant derivatives from the supersymmetry transformation laws, this makes it
inevitable that two of the i are minimally coupled fermions. the situation is related to unbroken
supersymmetries, but only loosely: the non-extremal black hole has the same minimally coupled
fermions that the extremal one does, and the extremal black hole preserves only one supersymmetry
but admits two minimally coupled fermions. the condition for an unbroken supersymmetry is that the
supersymmetry variations of all the fermions elds must vanish. so one would expect that there are
at least as many minimally coupled fermions as unbroken supersymmetries. more precisely, suppose
that there are n broken supersymmetries and m fermions in the theory whose equation of motion is
of the form i /d = 0, up to terms quadratic in elds with zero background value. then there must
be at least m  n minimally coupled fermions. for axion-free solutions to pure n = 4 supergravity,
m = 4.

the existence of minimally coupled fermions having been established, the computation of their
absorption cross-section now proceeds in parallel to the case of minimally coupled photons. if r(r)
is a solution of the radial equation (5.31) with  = s = 1/2, then the absorption probability is once
again

there is a conserved number current,

3the gravitino equation of motion has the form of the rarita-schwinger equation plus interactions. this equation
also has an so(4) index structure which is block diagonal, and the spin-1/2 particles decouple from the i = 3, 4
equations. the resulting gravitino equation,  i
 = 0, is less simple than the equations studied previously
 involves a non-vanishing combination of the eld strengths f3 and g3.
because the supercovariant eld strength i

the component 1/2, like 1 in the case of photons, is both the radiative component at innity for
infalling solutions and the nonzero component at the black hole horizon. the formula (5.64) thus
follows from (5.67) by the same analysis that gave (5.42) from (5.34).

5.6 the eective string model

the usual approach to eective string calculations (see for example [8, 21, 99, 101]) has been to
derive couplings between bulk elds and the eective string by expanding the dirac-born-infeld (dbi)
action to some appropriate order. the leading terms in the expansion specify a conformal eld theory
(cft) which would describe the eective string in the absence of interactions with bulk elds. the
interactions are dictated at leading order by terms in the expansion which are linear in the bulk elds:
for a scalar eld , a typical coupling would be

sint =z d2x (t, x, ~x = 0)o(t, x)

(5.72)

where o(t, x) is some local conformal operator in the cft. the integration is over the eective string
world-volume, and ~x is set to zero because this is the location of the eective string in transverse
space. one can then consider tree-level processes mediated by sint where a bulk particle is converted
into excitations on the eective string. although the applicability of the dbi action to d-brane
bound states can be called into question, the prescription described here for computing absorption or
emission rates appears to be very robust. in the spirit of [100], where eective string calculations were

61

used to account for properties of reissner-nordstrom black holes without reference to any underlying
microscopic picture, let us examine the consequences of couplings of the general form (5.72).

consider the absorption of a quanta of  with energy , momentum p along the eective string,
and transverse momentum ~p. we shall continue to use + signature, so for example p  x =
t  px  ~p  ~x. the absorption cross-section can be calculated by setting (t, x, ~x = 0) = eipx and
then treating (5.72) as a time-dependent perturbation to the cft which describes the eective string
in isolation. stimulated emission would be calculated by choosing eipx rather than eipx. the t and
x dependence of o(t, x) is xed by the free theory:

o(t, x) = eipxo(0, 0)eipx

(5.73)

where p x = ht p x, h and p being the hamiltonian and momentum operators of the cft. if one
considers the perturbation (5.72) to act for a time t, then fermis golden rule gives the thermally
averaged transition probability as

epi

z

p =xi,f

pif = ltxi,f

epi

z

(2)22(p + pi  pf )|hf|o(0, 0)|ii|2 .

(5.74)

this formula is valid for when the length l of the eective string is much larger than the compton
wavelength of the incoming scalar. in (5.74),  has two components, + = l and  = r. the
partition function splits into left and right sectors:

z = tr e p = (trl el p+ )(trr er p ) .

(5.75)

for simplicity we take the momentum p = (, 0, ~p) of the incoming particle perpendicular to the
brane, but clearly (5.74) remains valid for the case of particles with kaluza-klein charge.

the summation over nal states can become tedious when the scalar turns into more than two
excitations on the eective string. already in the case of xed scalars (chapter 3), which split into
two right-movers and two left-movers, the evaluation of this summation was a nontrivial exercise. it
therefore seems worthwhile to develop further a method employed in [100] in which the absorption
probability is read o from the two-point function of the operator o in the eective string cft.
allow t to take on complex values, dening o(t, x) by (5.73) for arbitrary complex t. according to
usual notational conventions [133], o(t, x) is no longer the adjoint of o(t, x) except when t is real;
instead, o(t, x) is evolved from o(0, 0) using (5.73). the conventional thermal greens function
takes t = i where  is the euclidean time:

g(i, x) = ho(i, x)o(0, 0)i = tr(cid:0) t(cid:8)o(i, x)o(0, 0)(cid:9)(cid:1)

where  = e p/z. one can continue to arbitrary complex t, dening t to time-order with respect
to (t). the convenience of doing this is that the integral

(5.76)

z d2x eipxg(t  i, x) =xi,f

epi

z

(2)22(p + pi  pf )|hf|o(0, 0)|ii|2

(5.77)

reproduces the right-hand side of (5.74). the proof of (5.77) proceeds by inserting pi |iihi| and
pf |fihf| into (5.76) before o and o respectively.
now let us turn to the evaluation of g(t, x). assume that o(t, x) has the form

o(t, x) = o+(x+)o(x)

(5.78)

where x = tx and o+ and o are primary elds of dimensions hl and hr, respectively. set z = ix
so that, for x real and t = i imaginary, z = ix+. the singularities in g(t, x) are determined by the

62

opes of o+ and o with themselves:

o+(z)o+( w) =
o(z)o

(w) =

(z  w)2hl

co+

(5.79)

g(t, x) factors into a left-moving and right-moving piece. the imaginary time periodicity properties
of each piece, together with their singularities, suce to x the form of g(t, x) completely:4

g(t, x) =

tl

sinh tlx+(cid:19)2hl(cid:18)

tr

sinh trx(cid:19)2hr

(5.80)

where co = co+ co.

at nonzero temperature, the absorption cross-section cannot be calculated straight from (5.74): for
bosons, the stimulated emission probability must be subtracted o in order to obtain a result consistent
with detailed balance, as described in chapter 3. the net result is to set absf t = p(1ep) where f
is the ux and p is read o from (5.74). for fermions, the presence of an incoming wave inhibits by the
exclusion principle emission processes leading to another fermion in the same state as the incoming
wave. the absorption cross-section must therefore be calculated using absf t = p(1 + ep). again,
this result is in accord with detailed balance.
the considerations of the previous paragraph can be restated compactly in terms of the greens

function:

(5.81)

one way to perform the integral in the rst line is rst to separate into x+ and x factors and then
to deform the contours in the separate factors by setting  = l/2 or r/2. assuming that bosons
and fermions couple, respectively, to conformal elds with hl + hr an integer or half an odd integer,
one indeed obtains the factor 1  ep required by detailed balance.
the formula (5.81) represents almost the most general functional form for an absorption cross-
section that the eective string model is capable of predicting. one possible generalization is for the
bulk eld to couple to a sum of dierent operators o(t, x), in which case a sum of terms like (5.81)
would be expected. another generalization can arise from a coupling of a bulk eld  to the eective
string not through its value (t, x, ~x = 0) on the string, as shown in (5.72), but rather through its
derivatives: for instance i(t, x, ~x = 0) where i labels a transverse dimension. in case of elds without
kaluza-klein charge, the eect of n such derivatives is simply to introduce an extra factor 2n on
the right hand side of (5.81). since the ux is f =  for a canonically normalized scalar, the 
dependence of the cross-section is

4tr(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

as we shall see in a specic example below, the ux factor for massless fermions cancels out a similar
factor in co. so for a fermionic eld which couples to the eective string through a term in the
4actually, there is a subtlety here: the information from periodicity and singularities must be supplemented by a

sum rule [133] on the spectral density to squeeze out an ambiguity in the analytic continuation.

the remarkable fact is that numerous classical absorption calculations that have appeared in the
literature [7, 8, 73, 99, 87, 21, 103, 102, 110, 112, 101, 75, 100, 113, 114, 71] all give results consistent
with (5.81) or (5.82) in the near-extremal limit. as an example, consider massless minimally coupled
scalars falling into the four-dimensional black hole considered in [87], whose eective string model is
derived from the picture of three intersecting sets of m5-branes. the absorption cross-section for the

consistent with a coupling to the eective string of the form ()o where o has dimensions hl =
hr =  + 1. another interesting example is the xed scalar [21, 96]. the cross-section for the s-

consistent with a coupling of the form t++t. it is not hard to convince oneself that the analysis
of the two-point function works the same when o(t, x) = t++(x+)t(x) as it did when o(t, x)
was the product of left and right moving primary elds.
one naturally expects that an equal charge black hole whose metric is extreme reissner-nordstrom,
like the n = 4 example we focused on in sections 5.2, 5.4.2, and 5.5, can be obtained in the eective
string picture by taking tl  tr, . indeed, it was found in [100] that ordinary scalar cross-sections
in this metric, and even in the kerr-newman metric, have precisely the form one would expect from
an eective string with tl  tr, . the cross-sections have no dependence on tl in this limit,
and the authors of [100] suggested a model which made no reference to the left-moving sector. note
however that left-movers seem the natural explanation for the nite entropy of extremal black holesa
subject not addressed in [100]. in [25] it was argued in the context of n = 8 compactications that
the cft on the eective string is a (0, 4) theory with central charges cl = cr = 6. the (local) su (2)
r-symmetry of the right-moving sector was identied with the group so(3) of spatial rotations of
the black hole. the same identication of a local su (2) on the eective string with so(3) was used
in [100]. we will assume that an eective string description with 4 supersymmetries and c = 6 in the
right-moving sector also applies to the equal charge black hole of n = 4 supergravity.

without committing to specic assumptions about the nature or existence of left-movers, one can
conclude that the general form for an eective string absorption cross-section of massless particles is

the cross-section (5.53) for minimally coupled photons ts the form (5.86) with hr = 2 and n = 1.
the form of the coupling of the minimal photon to the eective string is further constrained by rotation
invariance. if we represent the right-moving sector using 4 free chiral bosons (which are neutral under
su (2)) and an su (2) doublet of fermions, then simplest coupling to the minimal photon with the
right group theoretic properties is

lint = 



f+ + h.c.

(5.88)

where f+ is a left-moving eld which, as noted previously, does not aect the form of the absorption
cross-section. recall that  is a eld strength: one derivative is hidden inside it, so indeed n = 1.
the indices on 
 are for the group so(3) of spatial rotations, while the indices on  are for the
su (2)l half of the lorentz group so(3, 1). but they can be contracted as shown in a static gauge
description since the generators of so(3) are just sums of the generators of su (2)l and su (2)r.
with the current spinor index conventions, an upper dotted index is equivalent to a lower undotted
index if only spatial so(3) rotations are considered.

the dilaton and axion cross-sections (5.54) t the form (5.86) with hr = 2, and so does the minimal
fermion cross-section with hr = 3/2. the natural guess is a coupling of these elds to the stress-energy
tensor and the supercurrents: to linear order in all the elds,

lint =(cid:2)( + ib)t + 3t

now we are ready to compute eective string cross-sections. for the dilaton, the operator o(t, x)

entering into the analysis of (5.72)-(5.81) is

o(t, x) = t(x)(cid:0)f+(x+) + f +(x+)(cid:1) .

65

(5.93)

the fact that t is not primary does not alter the periodicity properties of its two-point function.
thus the arguments leading from (5.78) to (5.81) still apply, and co = ccf = 6cf . because of
the non-canonical normalization of the dilaton eld in the action (5.3), the particle ux in a wave
 = eipx is f = 4, four times the usual value. plugging these numbers into (5.81) and taking the
large tl limit, one obtains

abs =

(5.94)

the axion of course yields the same result.

the minimal fermions clearly have the same cross-section, so let us consider only 3. let the
(x)f+(x+), the analysis leading to (5.81)

incoming wave be 3 = ueipx. with o(t, x) = ut 
f
goes through as usual, yielding

co = u

(5.95)

in the second equality the equivalence of lower undotted and upper dotted indices has again been

used. recall that 20  is indeed the identity matrix. the ux is f = 4u 20 u. (as for the

dilaton, the 4 here is due to the non-canonical normalization of the fermion eld: see the footnote at
the beginning of section 5.5.2.) now (5.81) can be used again to give

abs =

lcf

(2tl)2hl1(2tr)2 (hl)2

(1 + 162) .

(5.96)

the eective string cross-sections (5.94) and (5.96) stand in the same ratio as the semi-classical
cross-sections for xed scalars and minimal fermions quoted in (5.54).

of course, it would be highly desirable to carry out calculations similar to the ones presented here
for the black holes in ve dimensions that can be modeled using the d1-brane d5-brane bound state.
there one can hope that an understanding of the soliton picture can x overall normalizations; but
again one expects the residual supersymmetry to x relative normalizations between fermionic and
bosonic cross-sections.

5.7 conclusion

one of the main technical results of this chapter has been to show that when the equations of motion for
photons or fermions are simple enough to be analyzed by the dyadic index methods of [120, 121, 122],
they lead to ordinary dierential equations whose near-horizon form is hypergeometric. that fact
alone gives their low-energy absorption cross-sections a form which is capable of explanation in the
eective string description.

dyadic index methods are not essential to the analysis of minimally coupled fermions; indeed, the
weyl equation for fermions has been analyzed recently in [71] in arbitrary dimensions using more
conventional techniques. however, the dyadic index method provides an ecient, unied treatment
of minimal fermions and minimal photons.
indeed, the photon radial equations (5.43) and (5.48)
seem dicult to derive by other means. the existence of minimally coupled photons seems to depend
essentially on the equal charge condition, which makes the dilaton background constant. minimally
coupled fermions, as suggested in section 5.5.2, may be more common because their existence depends
on the vanishing of their supersymmetry variations in the black hole background.

the greybody factors computed in (5.53) and (5.54) are polynomials in the energy  rather than
quotients of gamma functions as found in [75]. this is characteristic of an eective string whose
left-moving temperature tl is much greater than tr and . these polynomial greybody factors are

66

sucient to determine the conformal dimension of the right-moving factor in the operator through
which a eld couples to the eective string, and the number of derivatives in that coupling. for
example, the minimal photon couples through its eld strength times a hr = 2 operator. but (5.53)
and (5.54) do not yield any information regarding the left-movers. to see the eects of left-movers,
one might try to generalize the present treatment to black holes far from extremality, as was done
recently in [114] for minimally coupled scalars.

the absence of a string soliton description of the equal charge black hole in pure d = 4, n = 4
supergravity precludes a precise comparison of cross-sections between the eective string and semi-
classical descriptions. however, by assuming that the eective string world-sheet theory is a (0, 4)
super-conformal eld theory whose right-moving r-symmetry group, su (2), is identied with the
group of spatial rotations, it has been possible to show that the relative normalizations of the dilaton,
axion, and minimally coupled fermion cross-sections are correctly predicted by the eective string.
the proposed couplings of these elds to the eective string are simple: the scalars couple to the
stress-energy tensor while the fermions couple to the supercurrent. one would expect that it possible
to extend this picture to a manifestly supersymmetric specication of how all the massless bulk elds
couple to the eective string at linear order.

there is a simple point which nevertheless is worth emphasizing: the cross-sections of the dilaton,
axion, and minimal fermions are related by supersymmetry despite their dierent energy dependence.
the energy dependence (also known as the greybody factor) arises from nite-temperature kinematics.
unsurprisingly, the kinematic factors are dierent for particles of dierent spin; but their form turns
out to be xed by the conformal dimension of the eld by which a eld couples to the eective string.
supersymmetry acts on the s-matrix, relating the coecients we have called co in section 5.6. the
predictions of supersymmetry regarding the absorption cross-sections of dierent particles in the same
multiplet thus have more to do with the relative normalization than the energy dependence.

appendix: dyadic index conventions

this appendix presents in a pedestrian fashion the aspects of the newman-penrose formalism relevant
to the rest of the chapter. a readable introduction can be found in [135]; for an authoritative treatment
the reader is referred to [124].

sign conventions vary by author, and the ones used here are as close as possible to those of the
original paper by newman and penrose [123] and to those of teukolsky [120, 121]. first consider
at minkowski spacetime with mostly minus metric, ab = diag(1,1,1,1). the conventions on
raising and lowering spinor indices are those of northwest contraction:

 = 
  =     

 = 
  
  = 

(5.97)

where the sign of the antisymmetric tensors is xed by 01 = 01 =  0 1 =  0 1 = 1. in at space, the
conventional choice of the matrices a
 

which map bispinors to vectors is

a =

(1, 3, 1,2)

(5.98)

where the matrices i are the standard pauli matrices. vector indices are interchanged with pairs of
spinor indices using the formulae

(5.100)

in curved spacetime, the metric g is again chosen with + signature. in this chapter, the

metric is always of the form

it will turn out to be useful to dene not only the standard diagonal vierbein,

ds2 = e2a(r)dt2  e2b(r)dr2  e2c(r)(cid:0)d2 + sin2 d2(cid:1) .

one of the conveniences of working with spinors is that a spinor is a sort of square root of a null vector:
    is a null vector, and any null vector can be written in this form.
for any spinor , v = e
it is important to note that in the context of the newman-penrose formalism, spinor components are

six of the spin coecients vanish. this however complicates the time-reversal properties of the solutions.

the newman-penrose spin coecients are dened in an exactly analogous way.
in fact, they are
merely special (complex) linear combinations of the 
b. it is conventional in the literature to make
dyadic indices neutral under the covariant derivative : v = v. the covariant derivatives
of spinors, by contrast, are dened using the connection induced from 
b. it is convenient to dene
a completely covariant derivative d and a connection

chapter 6

absorption by non-dilatonic branes

6.1

introduction

dirichlet branes provide an elegant embedding of ramond-ramond charged objects into string theory
[4]. the d-brane description of the dynamics of these solitons may be compared with corresponding
results in the semi-classical low-energy supergravity.
in particular, a counting of degeneracies for
certain intersecting d-branes reproduces, in the limit of large charges, the bekenstein-hawking entropy
of the corresponding geometries [5, 6]. furthermore, calculations of emission and absorption rates for
scalar particles agree with a simple eective string model for the dynamics of the intersection
[6, 7, 8, 73, 99, 75, 87, 21, 96]. questions have been raised, however, whether the simplest model
is capable of incorporating all the complexities of black holes physics [112, 102, 103]. indeed, it is
possible that the dynamics of intersecting d-branes, which is not yet fully understood, cannot be
captured by one simple model.

this chapter, based on the paper [10], is concerned with the simpler congurations which involve
parallel d-branes only. their string theoretic description is well understood in terms of supersymmetric
u (n ) gauge theory on the world-volume [13]. perturbative string calculations of scattering [74, 136,
137] and absorption [138] are fairly straightforward for the parallel d-branes, and their low-energy
dynamics is summarized in the dbi action.

to leading order in the string coupling, n coincident dp-branes are described by o(n 2) free
elds in p + 1 dimensions. this result may be compared with the bekenstein-hawking entropy of
the near-extremal p-brane solutions in supergravity. in [45, 46] it was found the the scaling of the
bekenstein-hawking entropy with the temperature agrees with that for a massless gas in p dimensions
only for the non-dilatonic p-branes. the only representative of this class which is described by parallel
d-branes is the self-dual three-brane. other representatives include the dyonic string in d = 6, and
the two-branes and ve-branes of m-theory.
in [47] a way of reconciling the diering scalings for
the dilatonic branes [139] was proposed.1 nevertheless, in [9] it was shown that the non-dilatonic
branes (and especially the self-dual three-brane) have a number of special properties that allow for
more detailed comparisons between semi-classical gravity and the microscopic theory. for example,
the string theoretic calculation of the absorption cross-section by three-branes for low-energy dilatons
was found to agree exactly with the classical calculation in the background of the extremal classical
geometry [9].

what are the features that make the three-brane so special? in classical supergravity, the extremal
three-brane is the only rr-charged solution that is perfectly non-singular [141, 142, 143]. for n

1other ideas on how to nd agreement for the dilatonic branes were put forward in [140].

71

three-branes, the curvature of the classical solution is bounded by a quantity of order

1

n 10

n gstr

.

thus, to suppress the string scale corrections to the classical metric, we need to take the limit n gstr 
. this fact seems to lead to a strongly coupled theory on the world-volume and raises questions
about the applicability of string perturbation theory to macroscopic three-branes. however, in [9] it
was shown that the dimensionless expansion parameter that enters the string theoretic calculation of
the absorption cross-section is actually

where  is the incident energy. thus, we may consider a double scaling limit,

n 104  n gstr24 ,

n gstr   ,

2  0 ,

(6.1)

(6.2)

where the expansion parameter (6.1) is kept small. moreover, the classical absorption cross-section
is naturally expanded in powers of 4  (curvature)2, which is the same expansion parameter (6.1)
as the one governing the string theoretic description of the three-branes. the two expansions of the
cross-section thus may indeed be compared, and the leading term agrees exactly [9]. this provides
strong evidence in favor of absorption by extremal three-branes being a unitary process. while in
the classical calculation the information carried by the dilaton seems to disappear down the innite
throat of the classical solution, the stringy approach indicates that the information is not lost: it is
stored in the quantum state of the back-to-back massless gauge bosons on the world-volume which
are produced by the dilaton. subsequent decay of the three-brane back to the ground state proceeds
via annihilation of the gauge bosons into an outgoing massless state, and there seems to be no space
for information loss.

the scenario mentioned above certainly deserves a more careful scrutiny. in this chapter, we carry
out further comparisons between string theory and classical gravity of the three-brane.
in string
theory there is a variety of elds that act as minimally coupled massless scalars with respect to the
transverse dimensions. the dilaton, which was investigated in [9], is perhaps the simplest one to
study. in this chapter we turn to other such elds: the rr scalar and the gravitons polarized parallel
to the world-volume. we show that in classical gravity all these elds satisfy the same equation and,
therefore, are absorbed with the same rate as the dilaton. however, their cubic couplings to the
massless world-volume modes dictated by string theory [138] are completely dierent. in particular,
the longitudinally polarized gravitons can turn into pairs of gauge bosons, scalars, or fermions. adding
up these rates we nd that the total cross-section has the same universal value, in agreement with
classical gravity.

another interesting check concerns the absorption of scalars in partial waves higher than  = 0. in
[9] it was shown that the scaling of the relevant cross-sections with  and n agrees for all . for  = 1
we show that the coecient agrees as well. for  > 1 the simplest assumption about the eective
action does not yield a coecient which agrees with the classical calculation. normalization of the
eective action is a subtle matter, however, and we suspect that its direct determination from string
amplitudes will yield agreement with the classical cross-sections.

while a microscopic description of rr-charged branes is by now well known in string theory, the
situation is not as simple for the p-brane solutions of the 11-dimensional supergravity. there is
good evidence that a yet unknown m-theory underlies their fundamental description. comparisons
with semi-classical gravity provide consistency checks on this description. in [9] the scalings of the
classical absorption cross-sections were found to agree with the two-brane and ve-brane eective
action considerations. here we calculate the absorption cross-section of a longitudinally polarized
graviton by a single ve-brane. using the world-volume eective action, we nd that the absorption

72

cross-section is 1/4 of the rate formally predicted by classical gravity. in fact, one could hardly expect
perfect agreement for a single ve-brane  the classical description is expected to be valid only for a
large number of coincident branes. it is interesting, nevertheless, how close the two calculations come
to agreeing with each other. we also carry out a similar comparison for a single two-brane, but nd
the discrepancy in the coecient to be far greater than in the ve-brane case.

the structure of this chapter is as follows. in section 6.2 we exhibit the spacetime eective actions
and derive the classical equations satised by various elds. in section 6.3 we present the new three-
brane calculations. in section 6.4 we carry out the comparisons of classical 11-dimensional supergravity
with the predictions of the m-brane world-volume actions. we conclude in section 6.5.

6.2 spacetime eective actions and perturbations around non-

dilatonic p-brane solutions

6.2.1 perturbations of three-branes

the bosonic part of the eld equations of d = 10 type iib supergravity, which is the low-energy limit
of the type iib superstring [144], can be derived from the following action: [81, 145]

s10 =

45! f 2
(c4)mn klp  5[m cn klp ] ,

f5 = c4 + 5(b2c2  c2b2) .

following [145] we assume that the self-duality constraint f5 = f5 may be added at the level of the
equations of motion. this action is a useful tool for deriving the dimensionally reduced forms of type
iib supergravity action [145] and also for discussing perturbations near the solitonic p-brane solutions
given below. written in the einstein frame (gmn = e/2gmn ) it takes the following sl(2, r)
covariant form:

s10 =

theory. the indices , , ... (a, b, ..) will label the spacetime (spatial) coordinates parallel to the p-brane world-volume,
i.e.  = (0, a), a = 1, ..., p; the indices i, j, ..., will label the coordinates transverse to the p-brane, i = p + 1, ..., 9(10). we
shall also use , , ... for the indices of the dimensionally reduced theory obtained by compactifying the internal directions
parallel to the p-brane, i.e.  = (0, i). d will stand for the totally antisymmetric symbol (density). contractions over
repeated lower-case indices are always performed with the at metric, and a[ab]  1

with all other components and elds vanishing (i.e.  = c = b2 = c2 = 0, f5 = c4). the scalar
curvature  (c4)2  r2 near r = 0, in fact, this metric may be extended to a geodesically complete
non-singular geometry [142, 143]. this is the only rr-charged p-brane for which this is possible.
let us consider small perturbations near this background which depend only on x, i.e. on the
time t and the transverse coordinates xi. our aim is to identify the modes which have simple klein-
gordon type equations. a guiding principle is to look for (components of) the elds that have trivial
background values.

the obvious examples are the dilaton  and the ramond-ramond scalar c perturbations which

are decoupled from the c4-background and thus have the action ( = (, c))

where we have used the fact that for the three-brane background the einstein and the string frame
metrics are identical, gmn = gmn , which implies

g = diag(h1/2, h 1/2ij) ,

g10 = h 1/2 .

perturbations of the metric are, in general, mixed with perturbations of components of c4. an
important exception is the traceless part of the longitudinal (polarized along the three-brane) graviton
perturbations hab. these perturbations give rise to scalars upon dimensional reduction to d = 7. let
us split the metric in the 7+3 fashion

ds2

10e = g dxdx + gabdxadxb ,

and assume that all the elds depend only on x (this is equivalent to reduction to 7 dimensions).
then the relevant part of (6.4) becomes

where g7  det g, g3  det gab and we have written down explicitly the only f 2

potentially couple hab to the gauge eld strength background. introducing the normalized metric

gab which has unit determinant, we nd

where f = f123 is the d = 7 vector eld strength which, according to (6.6), describes an electrically
charged extremal black hole. thus, only the determinant of gab, which is related to the 7-dimensional
dilaton, couples to the gauge eld background. this is consistent with the fact that ab has a trivial
background value, ab = ab, while the value of det gab in (6.5) is g3 = h3/2.

the uctuations hab = ab  ab (which are traceless, haa = 0, to keep det ab = 1) thus have the

same quadratic part of the action as the scalar elds in (6.7)

similar conclusions hold for other p-brane solutions because the normalized internal space metric
ab has a at background value.

6.2.2 perturbations of two-branes and ve-branes

the discussion of perturbations around the two-brane and ve-brane solutions [147, 148] of the d = 11
supergravity is very similar to the analysis in the preceding subsection. the starting point is the
bosonic part of the d = 11 supergravity action [149]

s11 =

(6.11)

where (c3)mn kl = 4[m cn kl]. the two-brane and ve-brane backgrounds are respectively (a =

(6.12)

(6.13)

both for the two-brane and for the ve-brane, the scalar curvature is  (c3)2  r2 near r = 0.
there is a subtle dierence, however, in that the ve-brane metric may be extended to a geodesically
complete non-singular geometry, while the two-brane metric cannot [142, 143].

we consider small perturbations near these backgrounds which depend only on x = (t, xi). there
are no scalars like  or c in the d = 11 theory, but it is easy to check that, as in (6.8),(6.9), the
normalized internal part of the metric ab = g1/p
gab, gp  det gab (p = 2, 5), which has a at
background value, is decoupled from the (c3)2 term. as a result, the gravitons polarized parallel to
the brane, hab = ab  ab, haa = 0, have the minimal action as in (6.10),

6.3.1 classical absorption

this section focuses on minimally coupled scalars, such as those that satisfy the klein-gordon equation
following from (6.7), (6.10) with h(r) given in (6.6). because the classical analysis of absorption for
all partial waves of such a scalar was sketched in [9] and is similar to the matching calculations that
have appeared in many other places in the literature [7, 8, 73, 99, 75, 87, 21, 96, 37, 150, 71, 70],
details will not be presented here. in order to employ analytical rather than numerical techniques,
it is necessary as usual to take the compton wavelength much larger than the typical radii of the
black hole. fortunately, it is precisely in this region where agreement with string theoretic models is
expected [111].

recall from chapter 4 that in d spacetime dimensions, the absorption cross-section 

abs of a massless

scalar with energy  in the -th partial wave is related to the absorption probability 1  |s|2 by


abs =

2d3(d3)/2

(cid:19)(cid:0)1  |s|2(cid:1) .

(6.15)

75

for the three-brane one takes d = 7 since the other 3 dimensions are compactied on t 3. a matching
calculation outlined for all partial waves in [9] gives the absorption probability

1  |s|2 =

2(r)8+4

[( + 1)!]4( + 2)242+2 .

therefore, the classical result for the cross-section to absorb the -th partial wave of a minimally
coupled scalar is, to leading order in (r)4,

(6.16)

the scale parameter r of the classical three-brane solution (6.6) is related [45, 9] to the number n of
coinciding microscopic three-branes by the equation

r4 =

10
25/2 n ,

(6.17)

which follows from the quantization of the three-brane charge.

there is a number of minimally coupled scalars in the theory: the dilaton, the rr scalar, and
o-diagonal gravitons polarized with both indices parallel to the three-brane world-volume. the goal
of the next section will be to demonstrate that the universality of leading order cross-section for these
scalars, which is so obvious in the semi-classical framework, also follows from the d-brane description.

6.3.2 universality of the absorption cross-section for minimally coupled

scalars

the three-brane is the case where we know the world-volume theory the best: at low energies (and
in at space) it is n = 4 supersymmetric u (n ) gauge theory where n is the number of parallel
three-branes [13]. thus, the massless elds on the world-volume are the gauge eld, 6 scalars, and 4
majorana fermions, all in the adjoint representation of u (n ). as we will see below, the universality
of the cross-section is not trivial in the world-volume description: while for dilatons and rr scalars
leading absorption proceeds by conversion into a pair of gauge bosons only, for the gravitons polarized
along the brane it involves a summation over conversions into world-volume scalars, fermions, and
gauge bosons.

the world-volume action, excluding all couplings to external elds, is

s3 = t3z d4x tr(cid:2) 1

4 f 2

 + i
2

i i  1

2 (x i)2 + interactions(cid:3) .

(6.18)

the indices i = 1, ..., 4 and i = 4, ..., 9 label representations of the r-symmetry group, so(6). it is
clear from the d = 10 origin of this theory that the r-symmetry group is the group of spatial rotations
in the uncompactied dimensions. under this group, the gauge elds are neutral and the scalars x i

form a 6. when the fermions are written in chiral components, i =(cid:0)i

so(6) = su (4).

i(cid:1), the elds i form a 4 of

in order to properly normalize the amplitudes, one needs the kinetic part of the action for the bulk

elds, which is given by (6.7) and (6.10).

we also need to know how the three-brane world-volume elds couple to the bulk elds of type iib
supergravity. for a single three-brane, a -symmetric version of the dbi action in a non-trivial
type iib background was constructed in [33, 34] (see also [35, 36]), which, by use of superelds,
captures all such couplings to leading order in derivatives of external elds. for the terms necessary
to us, the generalization from u (1) to u (n ) gauge group is straightforward. one can, in principle,

76

obtain detailed information about the structure of the non-abelian action by directly computing string
amplitudes as done in [138]. the three-brane is well suited to this line of attack because the string
theory description is known exactly and is not complicated by the diculties one encounters in bound
states of intersecting branes, such as the d1-d5-brane system [31].

so(6) invariance and power counting in the string coupling greatly restrict the possible couplings
between the bulk and world-volume elds in the interaction part of the action sint.
in both the
semi-classical and world-volume computations, the dimensionless expansion parameter is not n gstr
but rather (r)4. a cross-section which involves n powers of this parameter arises from a coupling
of the bulk eld to a local operator o of dimension n + 4.

the leading bosonic terms in the action for a single three-brane in a type iib supergravity back-

ground are [32, 151, 152, 153]

s3 = t3z d4x(cid:18)q det(g + e/2f ) + 1

4!  c + 1

2

4 cf f (cid:19) ,

(6.19)

where

f = f + b ,

f  = 1

2 f ,

g = gmn x m x n , etc.,

and the background elds are functions of x m . in the static gauge (x  = x,  = 0, . . . , 3) one has

g = g + 2gi()x i + gijx ix j .

in at space the fermionic terms may be found by replacing g + e/2f by [33, 34, 35, 36]

g + e/2[f  2 ( + ix i) + i i] ,

where  is the d = 10 majorana-weyl spinor (which can be split into four d = 4 majorana spinors i
in (6.18)) and m are the d = 10 dirac matrices.

the leading-order interaction of the dilaton with world-volume elds implied by (6.19) was discussed
in [9]. the coupling of the rr scalar c is similar, being related by sl(2, r) duality. the coupling of
the gravitons polarized parallel to the brane, h = g  , to the bosonic world-volume elds can
be deduced by expanding the action (6.19). at the leading order it is given by 1
where
is the energy-momentum tensor of a and x i. the only possible supersymmetric extension
t bosons
is for h to couple to the complete energy-momentum tensor corresponding to (6.18).

let us rst consider an o-diagonal graviton polarized along the brane, say hxy, which is an example
of a traceless perturbation hab whose quadratic action is given in (6.10)). from (6.20) one can read
o the invariant amplitudes for absorption into two scalars, two fermions, or two gauge bosons:

where ~n is the direction of one of the outgoing particles. in (6.25) we have anticipated conservation
of energy and momentum by setting ~p1 + ~p2 = 0 and 1 + 2 = . it is remarkable that the sum
of these three quantities is independent of ~n. thus, if one performs the spin sums not just over all
polarizations and species of particles of a given spin, but rather over all the states in the n = 4
super-multiplet, the result is isotropic:

the leading factor of n 2 accounts for the multiple branes; the 1/2 is present because the outgoing

where we have used the relation (6.17) between n and r.

compared to the o-diagonal graviton, the calculation of the cross-section for the rr scalar is
relatively simple. inspection of the leading order amplitudes for absorption of a dilaton and a rr
scalar makes it obvious that they have the same cross-section:

6.3.3 higher partial waves

a more dicult comparison is the absorption cross-section for higher partial waves. it is possible to
argue, based on power counting and group theory, that the interaction term suggested in [9],

s

int = t3z d4x 1

4! i1  i tr(cid:0)x i1  x iff (cid:1)

(6.31)

is the only one that could possibly contribute at leading order to a given partial wave. it was shown
in [9] that this term predicts a cross-section for the -th partial wave whose scaling with  and n is
in agreement with classical gravity. here we show that, if we use the specic normalization given in
(6.31), we obtain precise agreement for  = 0, 1 but disagreement for higher . later on we will argue
that the disagreement for  > 1 may be due simply to an incorrect normalization of the necessary
eective action terms.

let us restrict our attention to the dilaton. it will be obvious that all our arguments apply equally
well to the rr scalar, and perhaps with a bit more attention to details to the o-diagonal gravitons.
the absorption cross-section (6.16) is of order +2
for the -th partial wave. processes which can
10
contribute to this absorption at leading order must be mediated by an operator o which involves
 + 2 elds. all interaction terms which involve the dilaton must include at least two powers of f
because of the restricted way in which the dilaton enters the dbi action. since the gauge bosons are
neutral under so(6), the other  elds must be responsible for balancing the so(6) transformation
properties of the -th partial wave. we want to argue that the only way this can be done is to use 
powers of the scalar elds x i. to do this it is necessary to know something about the addition rules
for representations of so(6) = su (4). the su (4) young tableaux for the elds in question are

i :

i :

x i:

:

. . .

(6.32)

|

 columns

{z

}

where  stands for the -th partial wave. there is a complicated general procedure known as the
littlewood-richardson rule for taking tensor products of representations of su (n ). it becomes much
simpler when one of the factors is a fundamental representation (k boxes in a single column) [154]. in
that case, one adds these k boxes to the other factors young tableaux in all possible ways, modulo
the restriction that not more than one box can be added to any given row. then one eliminates all
columns containing n boxes. using this rule it is easy to show that with  fundamental representations
as the factors in a tensor product, it is impossible to obtain the tableau for  unless all the factors
are 6 representations.

a shorter argument can be made based on purely dimensional grounds. the dimension of o must
 has dimension 4,

be  + 4 or the cross-section would be suppressed by extra powers of . since f 2
the other  elds must add  to the total dimension of o. the only possibility is  scalars.

the upshot is that the only possible term in the action which can contribute at leading order to
the absorption of a dilaton in the -th partial wave is, up to normalization, given by (6.31). the
normalization given there is the one arising from taylor expanding (x).4 actually, this action is
not quite the one we want for  > 1:
in addition to mediating the process which contributes at
leading order to the absorption of the -th partial wave, it makes subleading contributions to lower
partial waves. in order to isolate the -th partial wave, the product x i1  x i should be replaced
by an expression which transforms irreducibly under so(6). for  = 2 and  = 3, the appropriate
replacements are

x i1 x i2  x i1 x i2  1

 = 2:
 = 3: x i1x i2 x i3  x i1 x i2x i3  3

6 i1i2 x 2

8 (i1i2 x i3)x 2 .

(6.33)

4as we argue below, it is possible that this local expansion is not consistent with the string amplitude calculations.

this may remove the discrepancy for  > 1.

79

one thus subtracts an  = 0 contribution from the putative  = 2 term in (6.31), and an  = 1
contribution from  = 3. the whole taylor series can be thus reshued.

because the replacements in (6.33) project out a nal state with denite , it is permissible to
let the initial dilaton wave-function be ei(tx1) as usual. the derivatives i in (6.31) can then be
replaced by i1
i . the spin-summed amplitudes squared for absorption of the rst few partial waves

as before, p1 and p2 are the momenta of the outgoing gauge bosons. the gauge bosons are identical
particles, as are the  outgoing scalars, whose momenta will be labeled p3, . . ., p+2. to avoid over-
counting in the integral over phase space, we must include a factor of 1/(2  !) in the expression for
the cross-section. the cross-section also includes an explicit factor of 1/(2) from the normalization
of the incoming dilaton. altogether,

(6.37)

if the  = 2 and  = 3 d-brane cross-sections had been smaller than the corresponding classical results,
one might have wondered if the argument around (6.32) might possibly be invalidated by some peculiar
interaction. but any such additional interaction could only increase the d-brane cross-section, making
the disagreement even worse.

it is worth noting that nowhere in the literature have higher partial waves been compared with
complete success between d-brane models and general relativity. agreement up to numerical factors
was obtained in [100] for eective string models of four- and ve-dimensional black holes, and indepen-
dently in [155] for the ve-dimensional case; but in the absence of a well articulated prescription for
coupling the eective string to the bulk elds it is dicult to tell much about numerical coecients.
the agreement of the  = 1 cross-section certainly encourages us to believe that the d-brane
description is capable of handling partial waves correctly. on the level of eective eld theory this
may seem peculiar because, in this low-energy description, the d-brane has no thickness. how can
an object with no extent in transverse dimensions absorb particles with angular momentum? power
counting and group theory alone seem to dictate the answer (6.31), up to normalization.

80

fortunately, with three-branes the string theory prescription for the couplings to external elds is
more directly accessible than for other solitonic models of black holes. while it does indeed appear
that  > 1 partial waves present a test which the dbi action, supplemented by the prescription
of [9] to obtain the normalization of (6.31) via a taylor expansion, fails to pass, we expect that a
proper string theoretic treatment will once again yield agreement. for  = 1, a full-edged disk
amplitude computation veries both the form of (6.31) and the normalization shown. the  = 1
disk amplitude, which involves one bulk insertion and three boundary operators, is easy to deal with
because the insertion of one scalar vertex operator on the boundary simply generates a spacetime
translation. when more than one such operators are present, one encounters singularities in their
mutual collisions that need a careful treatment. the necessary calculations look quite complicated:
for example, computing the full  = 2 amplitude would be equivalent via the prescription of [137] to
computing a six point type i disk amplitude. they nevertheless seem highly worthwhile as a means
to rene our understanding of the world-volume action.

6.4 absorption cross-sections for m-branes

a remarkable aspect of the agreement between the string theoretic and the classical results for three-
branes is that it holds exactly for any value of n , including n = 1. as explained in the introduction,
the classical geometry should be trusted only in the limit gstrn  . thus, the agreement of the
absorption cross-sections for n = 1 suggests that our calculations are valid even in the limit gstr  ,
provided that gstr24 is kept small. the supersymmetric non-renormalization theorems are probably
at work here, insuring that there are no string loop corrections.

in this section we would like to ask whether the exact agreement between the absorption cross-
sections is also found for the two-branes and ve-branes of m-theory. these branes have much in
common with the self-dual three-brane of type iib theory: their entropies scale with the temperature
in agreement with the scaling for a gas of massless elds on the world-volume [46], while the scaling
of their absorption cross-sections with  agrees with estimates from the world-volume eective theory
[9]. while the eective actions for one two-brane [156] and one ve-brane [157, 158, 159] are now
known in some detail, their generalizations to n > 1 remain somewhat obscure.5 in this section we
compare the cross-sections for n = 1 and nd that, in contrast to the three-branes, there is no exact
agreement in the normalizations. this is probably due to the fact that m-theory has no parameter
like gstr that can be dialed to make the classical solution reliable.

first we discuss absorption of longitudinally polarized gravitons by an two-brane. the massless
elds in the eective action are 8 scalars and 8 majorana fermions. the longitudinal graviton couples
to the energy momentum tensor on the world-volume, t. the terms in the eective action necessary
to describe the absorption of hxy are (i = 3, . . . , 10; i = 1, . . . , 8)

where hxy is the canonically normalized eld which enters the d = 11 spacetime action as (cf. (6.14))

5it is believed, for instance, that n > 1 coincident ve-branes are described by non-trivial conformally invariant
theories in 5 + 1 dimensions. comparisons with classical gravity of the kind made in [46, 9] and here are among the
ways of learning more about this theory.

81

the absorption cross-section is found using the feynman rules in a manner analogous to the three-
brane calculation of section 6.3. for the 8 scalars, we nd that the matrix element squared (with all
the relevant factors included) is

the power of  does not match. this situation is reminiscent of the discrepancy in the near-extremal
entropy where the relative factor was a transcendental number involving (3) [46].

now we show that, just as for the three-brane, the transversely polarized gravitons have the same
absorption cross-section as the longitudinally polarized gravitons. the coupling of h67 to scalars is
given by

while pairs of fermions are not produced because the coupling to them vanishes on shell. the matrix
element squared is 2
114/2. multiplying this by the phase space factor, we again nd the cross-section
(6.39).

now we turn to the ve-brane. the massless elds on the ve-brane form a tensor multiplet
consisting of 5 scalars, 2 weyl fermions and the antisymmetric tensor b with anti-self-dual strength
[161, 162]. the transverse gravitons are again the easier case because they produce pairs of scalars
only (the coupling to 2 fermions vanishes on shell). the necessary coupling of h67 is similar to (6.40):

adding up the contributions of the entire tensor multiplet, we nd that all the direction-dependent
terms cancel out, just as they did for the three-brane and the two-brane. multiplying by the phase
space factor (6.41), we nd that the total cross-section for the longitudinally polarized gravitons is
again given by (6.42). this turns out to be a factor of 4 smaller than the classical result,

a conclusion that we may draw from this section is that, although the single m-brane cross-sections
scale with the energy in the same way as the classical cross-sections, the normalizations do not agree.
the ve-brane comes much closer to agreement than the two-brane, which may be connected to the
fact that the ve-brane supergravity solution is completely non-singular. for n = 1, however, the
curvature of the solution is of order of the 11-dimensional planck scale. obviously, the 11-dimensional
supergravity is at best a low-energy approximation to m-theory. the m-theory eective action should
contain higher-derivative terms weighted by powers of 11, by analogy with the  and gstr expansions
of the string eective action. thus, for n = 1, the classical solution may undergo corrections of order
one which we believe to be the source of the discrepancy. for large n , however, we expect the m-theory
cross-section to agree exactly with the classical cross-section. we hope that these considerations will
serve as a useful guide in constructing the world volume theory of n coincident ve-branes.

6.5 conclusions

in this chapter we have provided new evidence, furthering the earlier results of [9], that there exists
exact agreement between the classical and the d-brane descriptions of the self-dual three-brane of
type iib theory. the specic comparisons that we have carried out involve probing an extremal three-
brane with low-energy massless quanta incident from the outside. as argued in [9] and here, the great
advantage of the three-brane is that both the perturbative string theory and the classical supergravity
calculations are under control and yield expansions in the same dimensionless expansion parameter
(r)4  n gstr24, which may be kept small.
while the low-energy physics of the three-brane is described by a n = 4 sym theory, probing
it from the extra dimensions provides a new point of view and allows for a variety of interesting
calculations. one example is the absorption of a graviton polarized parallel to the brane which, as
discussed in section 6.3, couples to the energy-momentum tensor in 3+1 dimensions. because of the
existence of the transverse momentum, the kinematics for this process is that of a decay of a massive
spin-two particle into a pair of massless world-volume modes. summing over all the states in the n = 4
multiplet we nd that the rate is completely isotropic, which is undoubtedly related to the conformal
invariance of the theory. we should emphasize, however, that we are exploring the properties of this
theory away from the bps limit; therefore, they are not determined by supersymmetry alone. for
this reason, we nd it remarkable that the net absorption cross-section has the same value as that of
the dilaton and the rr scalar, and which agrees with the cross-section found in classical supergravity.
we have also carried out similar explorations of the physics of m-branes. these studies are ham-
pered, to a large extent, by insucient understanding of the multiple coincident branes of m-theory.
for a single two-brane, a formal application of classical gravity gives an answer which is o by a factor
of 42/(3), while for a single ve-brane  o only by a factor of 4. for the ve-brane the discrepancy
is relatively minor which, we are tempted to speculate, is due to the fact that its classical geometry is
completely non-singular, just like that of the three-brane. we should keep in mind, however, that for
singly charged branes the quantum eects of m-theory are expected to be important, and the classical
reasoning should not be trusted.

while in this chapter we have probed three-branes with massless particles, we may contemplate
another interesting use of the three-brane: it may be used as a probe by itself [164]. for example, n
coincident three-branes may be probed by a three-brane parallel to them. this situation is described
by a 3 + 1 dimensional n = 4 supersymmetric u (n + 1) gauge theory, with gauge symmetry broken
to u (n )  u (1). a more complicated theory will arise if a three-brane is used to probe a stringy
d = 4 black hole. as was shown in [26, 165], the d = 4 extremal black holes with regular horizons
(which are parametrized by 4 charges [61]) can be represented by 1/8 supersymmetric congurations
of four intersecting three-branes wrapped over a 6-torus. following [93, 166] one can nd an action
for a classical three-brane probe moving in this geometry. if the probe is oriented parallel to one of

84

the four source three-branes, the resulting moduli space metric is

where yi are toroidal coordinates transverse to the probe. in contrast to the case of the 5-brane-plus-
string-plus-momentum conguration describing d = 5 regular extremal black holes with 3 charges [82]
where one nds [167] that the non-compact part of the moduli space metric is multiplied by the product
of two harmonic functions, here we obtain the product of three harmonic functions. this is, however,
exactly what is needed to get the same near-horizon (r  0) behaviour as found in [167], i.e. that the 3-
dimensional non-compact part of the moduli space metric becomes at: ds2
3  r1r2r3(d2 + 2d2
2),
  r1/2  . this close similarity between a d = 5 black hole probed by a string and a d = 4 black
hole probed by a three-brane strongly suggests that one can obtain important information about
these black holes by studying the corresponding three-brane world-volume theory. this theory in
the presence of intersecting branes is necessarily more intricate than the simpler, parallel brane case
discussed in the main part of this chapter.

clearly, there is much work to be done before we claim a complete understanding of the remarkable
duality between the d-brane and the classical descriptions of the three-brane. the complexities that
aect the higher-spin classical equations remain to be disentangled. the numerical discrepancies for
 > 1 partial waves suggest an incomplete understanding of the low-energy eective action. as we have
argued in section 6.3, a direct string calculation is necessary to check normalizations. and nally, we
need to push our methods away from extremality where the physics is necessarily more complicated,
involving thermal eld theory in 3+1 dimensions. we hope that detailed insight into such a theory
will help explain the specic factors appearing in the near-extremal entropy [45].

we feel that further eorts in the directions mentioned above are worthwhile because they of-
fer a promise of building a theory of certain black holes in terms of a manifestly unitary theory 
perturbative string theory.

cross-sections and schwinger terms
in the world-volume

7.1

introduction

extremal black holes with non-vanishing horizon area may be embedded into string theory or m-theory
using intersecting p-branes [168, 62, 5, 6, 84, 85, 169, 26, 170]. these congurations are useful for
a microscopic interpretation of the bekenstein-hawking entropy. the dependence of the entropy on
the charges, the non-extremality parameter, and the angular momentum suggests a connection with
1 + 1 dimensional conformal eld theory [5, 6, 171, 84, 85, 26]. this eective string is essentially the
intersection of the p-branes. calculations of emission and absorption rates [6, 7, 8, 99, 75, 87, 21, 96,
112, 102, 103, 83, 101, 104, 22, 113, 114] provide further tests of the eective string models of d = 5
black holes with three charges and of d = 4 black holes with four charges. for minimally coupled
scalars the functional dependence of the greybody factors on the frequency agrees exactly with semi-
classical gravity, providing a highly non-trivial verication of the eective string idea [75, 87]. similar
successes have been achieved for certain non-minimally coupled scalars, which were shown to couple
to higher dimension operators on the eective string. for instance, the xed scalars [66, 67, 70] were
shown in chapter 3 to couple to operators of dimension (2, 2) [21] while the intermediate scalars
[101]  to operators of dimension (2, 1) and (1, 2). unfortunately, there is little understanding of the
eective string from rst principles, and some of the more sensitive tests reveal this deciency. for
instance, semi-classical gravity calculations of the xed scalar absorption rates for general black hole
charges reveal a gap in our understanding of higher dimension operators [83]. a similar problem
occurs when one attempts a detailed eective string interpretation of the higher partial waves of a
minimally coupled scalar, as we saw in chapter 4. even the s-wave absorption by black holes with
general charges is complex enough that it is not reproduced by the simplest eective string model
[112, 113, 114]. these diculties by no means invalidate the general qualitative picture, but they do
pose some interesting challenges. in order to gain insight into the relation between supergravity and
d-branes it is useful to study, in addition to the intersecting branes, the simpler congurations which
involve parallel branes only. this chapter, based on the paper [39], shows how absorption calculations
in linearized supergravity are related to certain schwinger terms in the operator algebra of the d-brane
world-volume gauge theory.

a microscopic interpretation of the entropy of near-extremal p-branes was rst studied in [45, 46].
it was found that the scaling of the bekenstein-hawking entropy with the temperature agrees with
that for a massless gas in p dimensions only for the non-dilatonic p-branes: namely, the self-dual
three-brane of the type iib theory, and the 2- and 5-branes of m-theory. their further study was

86

undertaken in [9, 10], where low-energy absorption cross-sections for certain incident massless particles
were compared between semi-classical supergravity and string or m-theory. for three-branes, exact
agreement was found for the leading low-energy behavior of the absorption cross-sections for dilatons
[9] as well as r-r scalars and for gravitons polarized along the brane [10]. the string-theoretic
description of macroscopic three-branes can be given in terms of many coincident d3-branes [172, 4].
indeed, n parallel d3-branes are known to be described by a u (n ) gauge theory in 3+1 dimensions
with n = 4 supersymmetry [13]. this theory has a number of remarkable properties, including exact
s-duality, and we will be able to draw on a known non-renormalization theorem in explaining the
absorption by the three-branes.

from the point of view of supergravity, the three-brane is also special because its extremal geometry,

is non-singular [142], while the dilaton background is constant. instead of a singularity at r = 0 we
nd an innitely long throat whose radius is determined by the charge (the vanishing of the horizon
area is due to the longitudinal contraction). thus, for a large number n of coincident branes, the
curvature may be made arbitrarily small in planck units. for instance, for n d3-branes, the curvature
is bounded by a quantity of order

1

(7.2)

in order to suppress the string scale corrections to the classical metric, we need to take the limit
n gstr  .
constant  = 87/2g2:

the tension of a d3-brane depends on gstr and  only through the ten-dimensional gravitational

t(3) =

(7.3)




this suggests that we can compare the expansions of various quantities in powers of  between the
microscopic and the semi-classical descriptions. indeed, the dominant term in the absorption cross-
section at low energy is (see chapter 6)

(7.4)

which agrees between semi-classical supergravity and string theory.

it is important to examine the structure of higher power in gstr corrections to the cross-section
[173]. in semi-classical supergravity the only quantity present is , and corrections to (7.4) can only
be of the form

(7.5)
however, in string theory we could in principle nd corrections even to the leading term  3, so that

(7.6)

presence of such corrections would spell a manifest disagreement with supergravity because, as we
have explained, the comparison has to be carried out in the limit n gstr  . the main purpose of
this chapter is to show that, in fact, bi = 0 due to a non-renormalization theorem in d = 4 n = 4
sym theory.

in section 7.2 we present a detailed argument for the absence of such corrections in the absorption
cross-section of gravitons polarized along the brane. these gravitons couple to the stress-energy tensor
on the world volume and we will show that the absorption cross-section is, up to normalization, the

87

central term in the two-point function of the stress-energy tensor. the fact that bi = 0 follows from
the fact that the one-loop calculation of the central charge is exact in d = 4 n = 4 sym theory.

the connection between absorption of gravitons polarized along the brane and schwinger terms
in the stress-energy correlators of the world volume theory is a general phenomenon that holds for
all branes. in section 7.3 we explore this connection to deduce some properties of the stress-energy
tensor opes for multiple 2-branes and 5-branes of m-theory, as well as for multiple 5-branes of string
theory.

7.2 d-brane approach to absorption

it was probably callan who rst realized that, in terms of d-brane models, absorption cross-sections
correspond up to a simple overall factor to discontinuities of two-point functions of certain operators
on the d-brane world volume [174]. this realization was exploited in [100] and in chapter 5. consider
massless scalar particles in ten dimensions normally incident upon d3-branes. if the coupling to the
brane is given by

sint =z d4x (x, 0)o(x) ,

where (x, 0) is a canonically normalized scalar eld evaluated on the brane, and o is a local operator
on the brane, then the precise correspondence is

(7.7)

(7.8)

(7.9)

here  is the energy of the incident particle, and

disc (p)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) p0 =
(p) =z d4x eipxho(x)o(0)i .

~p=0

when o is a scalar in the world volume theory, (p) depends only on s = p2, and disc (p) is
computed as the dierence of  evaluated for s = 2 + i and s = 2  i. in the case of the graviton,
we shall see that (p) is a polynomial in p times a function of s, so the evaluation of disc (p) is
equally straightforward.

the validity of (7.8) depends on  being a canonically normalized eld. in form it is almost identical
to the standard expression for the decay rate of an unstable particle of mass . the dimensions
are dierent, however:  is the cross-section of the three-brane per unit world volume, and so has
dimensions of (length)5. similar formulas can be worked out for branes of other dimensions and for
near-extremal branes, although away from extremality (7.9) would become a thermal greens function
(see chapter 5).

now let us work through the example of the graviton. the three-brane world volume theory is
n = 4 supersymmetric u (n ) gauge theory, where n is the number of parallel three-branes [13]. thus,
the massless elds on the world volume are the gauge eld, six scalars, and four majorana fermions,
all in the adjoint representation of u (n ). to lowest order in , and ignoring the couplings to the bulk
elds, the world volume-action is (i = 1, ..., 4; i = 4, ..., 9)

(7.10)

the interactions referred to here are the standard renormalizable ones of n = 4 super-yang-mills (see
for example [175] for the complete at-space action). in equation (6.18), a factor of the three-brane
tension t(3) appeared in front of the action. it is convenient to work with canonically normalized
elds, and so, relative to the conventions of chapter 6 we have absorbed a factor of pt(3) into a,

with a mostly minus metric and the spinor conventions of [175].

the full (and as yet unknown) action for multiple three-branes is non-polynomial, and (7.10)
includes only the dimension 4 terms. the higher dimension terms will appear with powers of 1/t(3),
which is to say positive powers of . they could give rise to corrections of the form (7.5), but not
(7.6).

despite our ignorance of the full action for multiple coincident three-branes, one can be fairly

condent in asserting that the external gravitons polarized parallel to the brane couple via

choosing the scalars to be minimally or conformally coupled does not aect the one-loop result for
the cross-section. but it is the traceless form of t presented in (7.12) which has a non-renormalized
two-point function. the reason is that the conformal t is in the same supersymmetry multiplet as
the supercurrents and the su (4) r-currents. n = 4 super-yang-mills theory is nite to all orders and
anomaly free in at space. the adler-bardeen theorem guarantees that any anomalies of the su (4)
r-currents can be computed exactly at one loop. because r and t 
 are in the same supermultiplet
(the so-called multiplet of anomalies), the one-loop result for the trace anomaly must also be exact.1
thus the trace anomaly in a curved background is the same as in the free theory:

make contributions to c in the ratio 2 : 2 : 1. the dierent spins contribute to the cross-section in
precisely the same ratio, as was demonstrated in chapter 6.

we have omitted terms involving the konishi current as well as terms less singular than 1/x4, and
we have anticipated the conclusion that the coecient on the schwinger term is precisely the central
charge c appearing in (7.14). a clean argument to this eect is presented in [178] and summarized
briey below. the schwinger term is nothing but the two-point function: with all factors and indices
written out explicitly2 [179],

ht(x)t(0)i =

where

x = 2 2   3 2( + )  4

(7.17)

(7.18)

the argument of [178] starts by obtaining an expression for the at space three-point function
ht 
 (x)t(y)t(z)i by expanding (7.14) around at space to second order. using ward identi-
ties for the conservation of t, one can then derive a relation on two-point functions which can only
be satised if the coecients c in (7.17) and (7.14) are identical.

we are nally ready to compute the cross-section. fourier transforming the two-point function

(7.17), one obtains

where, as before, s = p2. one easily reads o the discontinuity across the positive real axis in the

for the sake of deniteness, let us consider a graviton polarized in the x1x2 direction. x1212 = 34

in agreement with the classical result when c = n 2/4. the extra factor of 22 in the second expression
in (7.23) comes from the fact that h as dened in the text following (7.11) is not a canonically
normalized scalar eld; instead, h/22 is.

in summary, the non-renormalization argument is as follows: the graviton cross-section is read o
at leading order in , but correct to all orders in gstr, from the two-point function of the stress-energy

tensor. the two-point function is not renormalized beyond one loop because the schwinger term
in the ope (7.16) is similarly non-renormalized. that in turn is due to the fact that the central
charge appearing in the schwinger term is precisely the coecient of the weyl tensor squared in the
trace anomaly (7.14). the trace anomaly is not renormalized past one loop because t 
 is related by
supersymmetry to the divergence of the su (4) r-current, which is protected by the adler-bardeen
theorem against anomalies beyond one loop. another, more heuristic, reason why the central charge
should not be renormalized is that there is a critical line extending from gstrn = 0 to gstrn = . the
central charge is expected to be constant along a critical line. in four dimensions, this expectation
is supported by the work of [179].3 therefore, c can be calculated in the gstrn  0 limit where it is
given by one-loop diagrams.
we could adopt a dierent strategy and invert our arguments. requiring that the world volume
theory of n coincident three-branes agrees with semi-classical supergravity tells us that in the gstrn 
 limit its central charge approaches n 2/4. in the next section we will similarly deduce the schwinger
terms in the two-point functions of the stress-energy tensor for other branes. furthermore, we can
study two-point functions of other operators by calculating the semi-classical absorption cross-section
for particles that couple to them. for instance, the dilaton couples to tr f 2. the dilaton absorption
cross-section was calculated in [9]. the semi-classical result implies that the schwinger term here is
again  n 2 in the gstrn   limit. the comparisons with the gauge theory calculation in chapter 6
suggest that the one-loop result is again exact. it will be interesting to extract more results from
these connections between gravity and gauge theory.

7.3 extension to other branes

in this section we further explore the connection between the absorption cross-sections in semi-classical
supergravity and central terms in two-point functions calculated in corresponding world volume the-
ories. we proceed in analogy to the three-brane discussion presented in the previous section, and
consider absorption of gravitons polarized along the branes. in the world volume theories such gravi-
tons couple to components of stress-energy tensor, t. on the other hand, in supergravity such
gravitons satisfy the minimally coupled scalar equation with respect to the coordinates transverse to
the brane [10], as we have seen in chapter 6. this establishes a general connection between the absorp-
tion cross-section of a minimally coupled scalar and the central term in the algebra of stress-energy
tensors. for n coincident three-branes the world volume theory is known, and we have shown that the
conformal anomaly is in exact agreement with this principle. there are cases, however, where little
is known about the world volume theory of multiple branes. in such cases we can use our method to
nd the schwinger term without knowing any details of the world volume theory.

consider, for instance, the 2-branes and the 5-branes of m-theory. while the world volume theory of
multiple coincident branes is not known in detail, the extreme supergravity solutions are well-known.
the absorption cross-sections for low-energy gravitons polarized along the brane were calculated in
[9, 10, 160], with the results

for n coincident m2-branes we may deduce that the schematic structure of the stress-energy tensor
ope is

t (x)t (0) =

c2
x6 + . . .

(7.25)

where the central charge behaves as c2  n 3/2 in the large n limit. for n coincident m5-branes we

lines [180].

now the central charge behaves as c5  n 3 in the large n limit. these results have an obvious
indeed, the near-extremal
connection with properties of the near-extremal entropy found in [46].
entropy of a large number n of coincident m2-branes is formally reproduced by o(n 3/2) massless
free elds in 2+1 dimensions, while that of n coincident m5-branes is reproduced by o(n 3) massless
free elds in 5+1 dimensions.
as a nal example we consider the 5-branes of string theory. in [76] it was shown that their near-
extremal entropy is reproduced by a novel kind of string theory, rather than by massless elds in
5+1 dimensions. for n coincident d5-branes the string tension turns out to be that of a d-string
divided by n . this suggests that the degrees of freedom responsible for the near-extremal entropy are
those of fractionated d-strings bound to the d5-branes. an s-dual of this picture suggests that the
entropy of multiple ns-ns 5-branes comes from fractionated fundamental strings bound to them.4 we
would like to learn more about these theories by probing them with longitudinally polarized gravitons
incident transversely to the brane.

the extreme einstein metric of both the ns-ns and the r-r 5-branes is

where  = r. remarkably, this equation is exactly solvable in terms of bessel functions. the two
possible solutions are

clearly, there are two physically dierent regimes. for r > 1 the label of the bessel function is
imaginary, and the requirement that the wave is incoming for   0 selects the solution

(7.31)

(7.32)

from the large  asymptotics we nd that the absorption probability is

p = 1  e2(r)21 .

hence, for r  1 the absorption cross-section is

 =

4

3(cid:16)1  e2(r)21(cid:17) .

for r < 1 the question of how to choose the solution is somewhat more subtle. it is clear that

1(r)2(). if we approach the extreme
1j1(r)2 () is better behaved near  = 0 than 1j
5-brane as a limit of a near-extreme 5-brane, we indeed nd that 1j1(r)2 () is the solution that
is selected. since this solution is real, there is no absorption for r < 1.5 this result agrees with the
extremal limit of the 5-brane absorption cross-section calculated in [112].

4new insights into the world volume theory of ns-ns 5-branes were recently obtained in [181, 182, 183, 184].
5the fact that an extremal 5-brane in 10 dimensions does not absorb minimally coupled scalars below a certain

threshold was noted in [170].

92

it is not hard to generalize our calculation to higher partial waves. for the -th partial wave we

nd that the absorption cross-section vanishes for r   + 1. above this threshold it is given by

 =

4( + 1)2

3

(cid:16)1  e2(r)2(+1)2(cid:17) .

from (7.32) we reach the surprising conclusion that

ht (,~0)t (,~0)i

(7.33)

(7.34)

(7.35)

vanishes identically for  < 1/r, which implies that gravity does not couple to the massless modes

of the world volume theory! the threshold energy 1/r is precisely 1/pe , where e = 1/(2te)

and

1

te =

2r2

is the tension of the fractionated strings. the ordinary superstring has its rst massive excited state
at mass m2 = 2/. the threshold energy squared is half this value with  replaced by e . if one

is the rst excited level of the non-critical string living on the 5-brane. similarly, the higher partial

imagines producing a single massive string at  = 1/r, then its mass is m = 1/pe. perhaps this
wave thresholds might correspond to higher excited levels of mass ( + 1)/pe. if instead   1/r
the mass would be m = 1/(2pe ). neither picture yields any obvious explanation of the behavior

corresponds to the pair production threshold of the rst massive state of fractionated strings, then

(7.36)

ht (,~0)t (,~0)i (cid:2)(r)2  1(cid:3)1/2

just above threshold. pair production in a weakly interacting theory would predict a 7/2 power in
(7.36). it would be interesting to nd an explanation of the observed square-root scaling in (7.36).

we believe that our discussion applies to a large number of coincident d5-branes, as well as to
solitonic 5-branes of type iia and iib theories. this is because all these solutions have the same
einstein metric. perhaps in the large n limit some properties of the world volume theories of these
dierent branes become identical.6 for n coincident ns-ns 5-branes,

r2  n  .

(7.37)

thus, the absorption cross-section (7.32) is formally independent of gstr. therefore, our formula
should be applicable in the gstr  0 limit proposed in [182]. there it was argued that in this limit
the ns-ns 5-branes decouple from the bulk modes. we indeed nd that incident gravitons are not
absorbed for suciently low energies. however, above a critical energy of order 1/n  the 5-branes
do appear to couple to the bulk modes. as we have commented, this is probably related to the fact
that the scale of the string theory living on the 5-brane is

e = n  ,

(7.38)

i.e. the fundamental strings become fractionated [76].

in summary, we note that probing branes with low-energy particles incident from transverse direc-
tions is a useful tool for extracting correlation functions in their world volume theory. here we have
given an application of this technique to m2-branes and to 5-branes, but a more general investigation
would be worthwhile.

6we thank j. maldacena for suggesting this possibility to us.

greens functions from supergravity

8.1

introduction

the nature of the relation between gauge elds and strings is an old, fascinating, and largely unan-
swered question. its full answer is of great importance for theoretical physics. on one hand, it should
provide us with a theory of quark connement by explaining the dynamics of color-electric uxes.
on the other hand, it will perhaps uncover the true gauge degrees of freedom of the fundamental
string theories, and therefore of gravity. there is still a long way to go before we can hope to give a
satisfactory string theory account of the gauge theories observed in the real world. in this chapter,
based on the paper [18], we attempt nevertheless to make some forward progress by considering the
relation of maximally supersymmetric gauge theory to supergravity via d3-branes.

the wilson loops of gauge theories satisfy loop equations which translate the schwinger-dyson
equations into variational equations on the loop space [185, 186]. these equations should have a
solution in the form of the sum over random surfaces bounded by the loop. these are the world
surfaces of the color-electric uxes. for the su (n ) yang-mills theory they are expected to carry the
t hooft factor [187], n , where  is the euler character. hence, in the large n limit where g2
y m n is
kept xed only the simplest topologies are relevant.

until recently, the action for the conning string had not been known. in [188] it was suggested
that it must have a rather unusual structure. let us describe it briey. first of all, the world surface
of the electric ux propagates in at least 5 dimensions. this is because the non-critical strings are
described by the elds

x () ,

gij() = e()ij ,

(8.1)

where x  belong to 4-dimensional (euclidean) space and gij() is the world sheet metric in the
conformal gauge. the general form of the world sheet lagrangian compatible with the 4-dimensional
symmetries is

l =

1
2

(i)2 + a2()(ix )2 + ()(2)r + ramond  ramond backgrounds ,

(8.2)

where (2)r is the world sheet curvature, () is the dilaton [189], while the eld

() = a2()

denes a variable string tension. in order to reproduce the zig-zag symmetry of the wilson loop, the
gauge elds must be located at a certain value  =  such that a() = 0. we will call this point
the horizon.

94

the background elds (), a() and others must be chosen to satisfy the conditions of conformal
invariance on the world sheet [190]. after this is done, the relation between gauge elds and strings
can be described as an isomorphism between the general yang-mills operators of the type

z d4xeipx tr (1 . . . f11 . . .n . . . fnn (x))

and the algebra of vertex operators of string theory, which have the form

v 1...n (p) =z d2i1...inj1...jm

p

(cid:0)()(cid:1)eipx()i1 x 1 . . . in x nj1  . . . jm  ,

(8.3)

(8.4)

where the wave functions i1...inj1...jm
() are again determined by the conformal invariance on the
world sheet. the isomorphism mentioned above implies the coincidence of the correlation functions
of these two sets of vertex operators.

p

another, seemingly unrelated, development is connected with the dirichlet brane [4] description
of black three-branes in [45, 9, 10, 39]. the essential observation is that, on the one hand, the black
branes are solitons which curve space [54] and, on the other hand, the world volume of n parallel d-
branes is described by supersymmetric u (n ) gauge theory with 16 supercharges [13]. a particularly
interesting system is provided by the limit of a large number n of coincident d3-branes [45, 9, 10, 39],
whose world volume is described by n = 4 supersymmetric u (n ) gauge theory in 3 + 1 dimensions.
for large g2
y m n the curvature of the classical geometry becomes small compared to the string scale
[9], which allows for comparison of certain correlation functions between the supergravity and the
gauge theory, with perfect agreement [9, 10, 39]. corrections in powers of  times the curvature on
the string theory side correspond to corrections in powers of (g2
y m n )1/2 on the gauge theory side.
the string loop corrections are suppressed by powers of 1/n 2.

the vertex operators introduced in [9, 10, 39] describe the coupling of massless closed string elds

to the world volume. for example, the vertex operator for the dilaton is

while that for the graviton polarized along the three-branes is

z d4xeipx tr f f (x)

z d4xeipxt (x) ,

(8.5)

(8.6)

where t  is the stress tensor. the low energy absorption cross-sections are related to the two-point
functions of the vertex operators, and turn out to be in complete agreement with conformal invariance
and supersymmetric non-renormalization theorems, as we saw in chapter 7. an earlier calculation [45]
of the entropy as a function of temperature for n coincident d3-branes exhibits a dependence expected
of a eld theory with o(n 2) massless elds. as we saw in chapter 2, the entropy turns out to be 3/4 of
the free eld answer. this is not a discrepancy since the free eld result is valid for small g2
y m n , while
the result of [45] is applicable as g2
y m n  . we now regard this result as a non-trivial prediction
of supergravity concerning the strong coupling behavior of n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory at
large n and nite temperature.

the non-critical string and the d-brane approaches to 3+1 dimensional gauge theory have been
synthesized in [16] by rescaling the three-brane metric and taking the limit in which it has conformal
symmetry, being the direct product ads5  s5.1 this is exactly the conning string ansatz [188] with
(8.7)

a() = e/r ,

1the papers that put an early emphasis on the anti-de sitter nature of the near-horizon region of certain brane
congurations, and its relation with string and m-theory, are [161, 142]. other ideas on the relation between branes
and ads supergravity were recently pursued in [191, 192, 193].

corresponding to the case of constant negative curvature of order 1/r2. the horizon is located at
 = . the liouville eld is thus related to the radial coordinate of the space transverse to the
three-brane. the extra s5 part of the metric is associated with the 6 scalars and the o(6) r-symmetry
present in the n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory.

the purpose of this chapter is to make the next step and show how the excited states of the
conning string are related to the anomalous dimensions of the sym theory. hopefully this analysis
will help future explorations of asymptotically free gauge theories needed for quark connement.

we will suggest a potentially very rich and detailed means of analyzing the throat-brane corre-
spondence: we propose an identication of the generating function of the greens functions of the
superconformal world-volume theory and the supergravity action in the near horizon background ge-
ometry. we will nd it necessary to introduce a boundary of the ads5 space near the place where the
throat turns into the asymptotically at space. thus, the anti-de sitter coordinate  is dened on a
half-line (, 0], similarly to the liouville coordinate of the 2-dimensional string theory [194, 195].
the correlation functions are specied by the boundary terms in the action, again in analogy with
the c = 1 case. one new prediction that we will be able to extract this way is for the anomalous
dimensions of the gauge theory operators that correspond to massive string states. for a state at level
n we nd that, for large g2

y m n , the anomalous dimension grows as 2n(2g2

y m n )1/4.

8.2 greens functions from the supergravity action

the geometry of a large number n of coincident d3-branes is

ds2 =(cid:18)1 +

r4

r4(cid:19)1/2

the parameter r, where

(cid:0)dt2 + d~x2(cid:1) +(cid:18)1 +

r4 =

,

r4

r4(cid:19)1/2



t3 =

(cid:0)dr2 + r2d2
5(cid:1) .

(8.8)

(8.9)

is the only length scale for the geometry. t3 is the tension of a single d3-brane, and  is the ten-
dimensional gravitational coupling. the near-horizon geometry of n d3-branes is ads5  s5, as one
can see most easily by dening the radial coordinate z = r2/r. then

the relation to the coordinate  used in the previous section is

r2

ds2 =

z2 (cid:0)dt2 + d~x2 + dz2(cid:1) + r2d2

5 .

z = re/r .

(8.10)

(8.11)

note that the limit z  0 is far from the brane. of course, for z < r the ads form (8.10) gets
modied, and for z  r one obtains at ten-dimensional minkowski space. we will continue to use
the phrase far from the brane to emphasize that the all-important boundary conditions at small z
are not imposed far down the throat, but rather at the border region where the throat merges into
at space. the geometry is geodesically complete and nonsingular, so there is no sense in which any
one point on ads5 is the location of the brane.

the basic idea is to identify the generating functional of connected greens functions in the gauge
theory with the minimum of the supergravity action, subject to some boundary conditions at z = r
and z = :

w [g(x)] = k[g(x)] = s[g(x, z)] .

(8.12)

w generates the connected greens functions of the gauge theory; s is the supergravity action on the
ads space; while k is the minimum of s subject to the boundary conditions. we have kept only the

96

metric g(x) of the world-volume as an explicit argument of w . the boundary conditions subject
to which the supergravity action s is minimized are

r2

ds2 =

z2 (cid:0)gdxdx + dz2(cid:1) + o(1)

as z  r .

(8.13)

all uctuations have to vanish as z  .

a few renements of the identication (8.12) are worth commenting on. first, it is the generator
of connected greens functions which appears on the left hand side because the supergravity action
on the right hand side is expected to follow the cluster decomposition principle. second, because
classical supergravity is reliable only for a large number n of coincident branes, (8.12) can only be
expected to capture the leading large n behavior. corrections in 1/n should be obtained as loop
eects when one replaces the classical action s with an eective action . this is sensible since the
dimensionless expansion parameter 2/r8  1/n 2. we also note that, since ()2/r4  (g2
y m n )1,
the string theoretic  corrections to the supergravity action translate into gauge theory corrections
proportional to inverse powers of g2
y m n . finally, the fact that there is no covariant action for type
iib supergravity does not especially concern us: to obtain n-point greens functions one is actually
considering the nth variation of the action, which for n > 0 can be regarded as the (n  1)th variation
of the covariant equations of motion.
in section 8.2.2 we will compute a two-point function of massless vertex operators from (8.12),
compare it with the absorption calculations in [9, 10, 39] and nd exact agreement. however it is
instructive rst to examine boundary conditions.

8.2.1 preliminary: symmetries and boundary conditions

as a preliminary it is useful to examine the appropriate boundary conditions and how they relate
to the conformal symmetry.
in this discussion we follow the work of brown and henneaux [196].
in the consideration of geometries which are asymptotically anti-de sitter, one would like to have a
realization of the conformal group on the asymptotic form of the metric. restrictive or less restrictive
boundary conditions at small z (far from the brane) corresponds, as brown and henneaux point out
in the case of ads3, to smaller or larger asymptotic symmetry groups. on an adsd+1 space,

ds2 = gmndxmdxn =

r2

z2 (cid:0)dt2 + d~x2 + dz2(cid:1)

(8.14)

where now ~x is d  1 dimensional, the boundary conditions which give the conformal group as the
group of asymptotic symmetries are

g = o(1) ,

gz = o(z) ,

gzz = o(1) .

(8.15)

our convention is to let indices m, n run from 0 to d (that is, over the full adsd+1 space) while , 
run only from 0 to d  1 (i.e. excluding z = xd). dieomorphisms which preserve (8.15) are specied
by a vector m which for small z must have the form

z2
d

 (

,) + o(z4)

(8.16)

 =  
z =


z
d

, + o(z3) .

here  is allowed to depend on t and ~x but not r. (8.16) species only the asymptotic form of m at
large r, in terms of this new vector .
now the condition that the variation

gmn = l gmn = kkgmn + gknmk + gmknk

(8.17)

97

be of the allowed size specied in (8.15) is equivalent to

, + , =

2
d


,

(8.18)

where now we are lowering indices on  with the at space minkowski metric  . since (8.18) is the
conformal killing equation in d dimensions (d = 4 for the three-brane), we see that we indeed recover
precisely the conformal group from the set of permissible .

the spirit of [196] is to determine the central charge of an ads3 conguration by considering the
commutator of deformations corresponding to virasoro generators lm and lm. this method is
not applicable to higher dimensional cases because the conformal group becomes nite, and there
is apparently no way to read o a schwinger term from commutators of conformal transformations.
nevertheless, the notion of central charge can be given meaning in higher dimensional conformal eld
theories, either via a curved space conformal anomaly (also called the gravitational anomaly) or as the
normalization of the two-point function of the stress energy tensor [178]. we shall see in section 8.2.2
that a calculation reminiscent of absorption probabilities allows us to read o the two-point function
of stress-energy tensors in n = 4 super-yang-mills, and with it the central charge.

8.2.2 the central charge from the stress tensor two-point function

as a preliminary, it is instructive to consider the case of a minimally coupled massless scalar propa-
gating in the anti-de sitter near-horizon geometry (one example of such a scalar is the dilaton  [9]).
as a further simplication we assume for now that  is in the s-wave (that is, there is no variation
over s5). then the action becomes

s =

22z d10xg(cid:2) 1
42 z d4x z 

3r8

2 gmn m n (cid:3)
z3 (cid:2)(z)2 +  (cid:3) .

dz

r

(8.19)

note that in (8.19), as well as in all the following equations, we take  to be the ten-dimensional
gravitational constant. the equations of motion resulting from the variation of s are

(cid:20)z3z

1

z3 z +  (cid:21)  = 0 .

a complete set of normalizable solutions is

k(x) = keikx k(z) where

k(z) =

z2k2(kz)
r2k2(kr)

,

k2 = ~k2  2 .

(8.20)

(8.21)

we have chosen the modied bessel function k2(kz) rather than i2(kz) because the functions k(kz)
fall o exponentially for large z, while the functions i (kz) grow exponentially. in other words, the
requirement of regularity at the horizon (far down the throat) tells us which solution to keep. a
connection of this choice with the absorption calculations of [9] is provided by the fact that, for time-
like momenta, this is the incoming wave which corresponds to absorption from the small z region. k
is a coupling constant, and the normalization factor has been chosen so that k = 1 for z = r.

let us consider a coupling

sint =z d4x (x)o(x)

98

(8.22)

in the world-volume theory. if  is the dilaton then according to [9] one would have o = 1
then the analogue of (8.12) is the claim that

4 tr f 2.

w [(x)] = k[(x)] = s[(x, z)]

(8.23)

where (x, z) is the unique solution of the equations of motion with (x, z)  (x) as z  r.
note that the existence and uniqueness of  are guaranteed because the equation of motion is just the
laplace equation on the curved space. (one could in fact compactify x on very large t 4 and impose
the boundary condition (x, z) = (x) at z = r. then the determination of (x, z) is just the
dirichlet problem for the laplacian on a compact manifold with boundary).

analogously to the work of [194] on the c = 1 matrix model, we can obtain the quadratic part of

k[(x)] as a pure boundary term through integration by parts,

k[(x)] =

calculation) is

(8.25)

in (8.24) we have suppressed the boundary terms in the x directionsagain, one can consider these
compactied on very large t 4 so that there is no boundary. we have also used (8.9) to simplify the
prefactor. finally, we have cut o the integral at r as a regulator of the small z divergence. this
is in fact appropriate since the d3-brane geometry is anti-de sitter only for z  r. since there is
exponential fallo in k as z  , only the behavior at r matters.
to calculate the two-point function of o in the world-volume theory, we dierentiate k twice with
respect to the parameters i:2

another interesting application of this analysis is to the two-point function of the stress tensor,

(8.29)

(8.30)

for metric perturbations g =  + h around at space, the coupling of h at linear order is

sint =z d4x 1

2 h t .

(8.31)

furthermore, at quadratic order the supergravity action for a graviton polarized along the brane,
hxy(k), is exactly the minimal scalar action, provided the momentum k is orthogonal to the xy plane.
we can therefore carry over the result (8.26) to obtain

htxy(k)txy(q)i = (2)44(k + q)

n 2
642 k4 ln(k2r2) + (analytic in k2) ,

(8.32)

which upon fourier transform can be compared with (8.29) to give c = n 2/4. in view of the conformal
symmetry of both the supergravity and the gauge theory, the evaluation of this one component is a
sucient test.

the conspiracy of overall factors to give the correct normalization of (8.32) clearly has the same
origin as the successful prediction of the minimal scalar s-wave absorption cross-section examined in
[9] and chapters 6 and 7. the absorption cross-section is, up to a constant of proportionality, the
imaginary part of (8.32).
in [9] the absorption cross-section was calculated in supergravity using
propagation of a scalar eld in the entire three-brane metric, including the asymptotic region far from
the brane. here we have, in eect, replaced communication of the throat region with the asymptotic
region by a boundary condition at one end of the throat. the physics of this is clear: signals coming
from the asymptotic region excite the part of the throat near z = r. propagation of these excitations
into the throat can then be treated just in the anti-de sitter approximation. thus, to extract physics
from anti-de sitter space we must introduce a boundary at z = r and take careful account of the
boundary terms that contain the dynamical information.

it now seems clear how to proceed to three-point functions: on the supergravity side one must
expand to third order in the perturbing elds, including in particular the three point vertices. at
higher orders the calculation is still simple in concept (the classical action is minimized subject to
boundary conditions), but the complications of the n = 8 supergravity theory seem likely to make
the computation of, for instance, the four-point function, rather tedious. we leave the details of such
calculations for the future. it may be very useful to compute at least the three point functions in
order to have a consistency check on the normalization of elds.

one extension of the present work is to consider what elds couple to the other operators in the
n = 4 supercurrent multiplet. the structure of the multiplet (which includes the supercurrents, the
su (4) r-currents, and four spin 1/2 and one scalar eld) suggests a coupling to the elds of gauged
n = 4 supergravity. the question then becomes how these elds are embedded in n = 8 supergravity.
we leave these technical issues for the future, but with the expectation that they are bound to work
based on supersymmetry.

100

the main lesson we have extracted so far is that, for certain operators that couple to the massless
string states, the anomalous dimensions vanish. we expect this to hold for all massless vertex oper-
ators. this may be the complete set of operators that are protected by supersymmetry. as we will
see in the next section, other operators acquire anomalous dimensions that grow for large t hooft
coupling.

8.3 massive string states and anomalous dimensions

before we proceed to the massive string states, a useful preliminary is to discuss the higher par-
tial waves of a minimally coupled massless scalar. the action in ve dimensions (with lorentzian
signature), the equations of motion, and the solutions are

(8.36)

(8.37)

as before, we have neglected terms containing analytic powers of k and focused on the leading non-
analytic term. this formula indicates that the operator that couples to -th partial wave has dimension
4 + . in [9] it was shown that such operators with the so(6) quantum numbers of the -th partial
wave have the form

z d4xeikx trh(cid:16)x (ii . . . x i) + . . .(cid:17) f f  (x)i ,

(8.38)

where in parenthesis we have a traceless symmetric tensor of so(6). thus, supergravity predicts that
their non-perturbative dimensions equal their bare dimensions.

now let us consider massive string states. our goal is to use supergravity to calculate the anomalous
dimensions of the gauge theory operators that couple to them. to simplify the discussion, let us focus
on excited string states which are spacetime scalars of mass m. the propagation equation for such a
eld in the background of the three-brane geometry is

using (8.41) we nd that the spectrum of dimensions for operators that couple to massive string states

(8.45)

equation (8.45) is a new non-trivial prediction of the string theoretic approach to large n gauge
theory.4

we conclude that, for large t hooft coupling, the anomalous dimensions of the vertex operators
corresponding to massive string states grow without bound. by contrast, the vertex operators that

3these solutions are reminiscent of the loop correlators calculated for c  1 matrix models in [197].
4we do not expect this equation to be valid for arbitrarily large n, because application of linearized local eective
actions to arbitrarily excited string states is questionable. however, we should be able to trust our approach for
moderately excited states.

102

couple to the massless string states do not acquire any anomalous dimensions. this has been checked
explicitly for gravitons, dilatons and rr scalars [9, 10, 39], and we believe this to be a general
statement.5 thus, there is an innite class of operators that do not acquire anomalous dimensions
(this is probably due to the fact that they are protected by susy). the rest of the operators are
not protected and can receive arbitrarily large anomalous dimensions. such large dimensions may
be expected to freeze out the operators from the local operator algebra, just as the corresponding
massive string states are frozen out of the supergravity description. while we cannot yet write down
the explicit form of these operators in the gauge theory, it seems likely that they are conventional local
operators, such as (8.3). indeed, the coupling of a highly excited string state to the world volume may
be guessed on physical grounds. since a string in a d3-brane is a path of electric ux, it is natural to

assume that a string state couples to a wilson loop o = exp(cid:16)ih a(cid:17). expansion of a small loop in

powers of f yields the local polynomial operators.

there is one potential problem with our treatment of massive states. the minimal linear equation
(8.39) where higher derivative terms are absent may be true only for a particular eld denition
(otherwise corrections in positive powers of 2 will be present in the equation). therefore, it is
possible that there are energy dependent leg factors relating the operators o in (8.44) and the gauge
theory operators of the form (8.3). we hope that these leg factors do not change our conclusion about
the anomalous dimensions. however, to completely settle this issue we need to either nd an exact
sigma-model which incorporates all  corrections or to calculate the three-point functions of massive
vertex operators.

8.4 conclusions

there are many unanswered questions that we have left for the future. so far, we have considered
the limit of large t hooft coupling, since we used the one-loop sigma-model calculations for all
operators involved. if this coupling is not large, then we have to treat the world sheet theory as an
exact conformal eld theory (we stress, once again, that the string loop corrections are  1/n 2 and,
therefore, vanish in the large n limit). this conformal eld theory is a sigma-model on a hyperboloid.
it is plausible that, in addition to the global o(2, 4) symmetry, this theory possesses the o(2, 4)
kac-moody algebra. if this is the case, then the sigma model is tractable with standard methods of
conformal eld theory.

throughout this work we detected many formal similarities of our approach with that used in c  1
matrix models. these models may be viewed as early examples of gauge theory  non-critical string
correspondence, with the large n matrix models playing the role of gauge theories. clearly, a deeper
understanding of the connection between the present work and the c  1 matrix models is desirable.

5a more general set of such massless elds is contained in the supermultiplet of ads gauge elds, whose reduction

to the boundary was recently studied in [198].

chapter 9

concluding remarks

because this dissertation represents the authors contribution to a rapidly evolving eld, it is perhaps
more worthwhile to look ahead to where the eld may be moving rather than to simply recapitulate
the contents of chapters 2-8. there are certainly a number of avenues for further research, but perhaps
the most attractive revolve around the idea of focusing on the near-horizon geometry of p-branes and
the relation to gauge theory.

the near-horizon geometry of simple d-brane congurations is in general a homogeneous space:
for example, d3-branes have as their near-horizon geometry ads5  s5 = so(4, 2)/so(4, 1) 
so(6)/so(5). writing the anti-de sitter factor as a quotient of groups makes the conformal symme-
try manifest. there is certainly great interest in investigating further how the properties of conformal
eld theories can be reected by supergravity on homogeneous spaces; but from a mainstream physics
point of view the most signicant extensions of the work in chapter 8 would involve non-conformal
gauge theories, such as pure n = 2, 1, or 0 gauge theory in four dimensions. these theories have
non-vanishing beta-functions, and for n < 2 there is connement. already in [199] a way of studying
non-conformal theories and connement holographically has been suggested, using brane congura-
tions at nite temperature. a very clean way to proceed would be to perturb the d3-brane solution
by what in the gauge theory are relevant operators (for instance, scalar or fermion masses). the
resulting geometry should reect softly broken n = 4 gauge theory, which in general does conne in
the infrared. to put it another way, n = 4 would be the ultraviolet regulator of a conning theory.
several ideas for studying soft breakings in supergravity have been proposed, but the main diculty
lies in nding solutions of the full non-linear supergravity equations with less symmetry than the usual
three-brane solution.
the greatest conceptual limitation of the supergravitygauge theory correspondence is the require-
ment of large n and strong t hooft coupling gy mn . let us review the reasons for these require-
ments. the formulas will be specic to the case of the three-brane, but similar observations apply to
other brane congurations like the d1-d5 bound state. supergravity has a scale (the planck scale)
because the gravitational coupling  is dimensionful. the near-horizon geometry has length scale r
and is an exact solution to the tree-level supergravity equations. loop corrections in supergravity are
suppressed only if /r4 is small. but /r4  1/n , so we see the origin of the large n requirement.
also, supergravity is the   0 limit of string theory, and the  corrections can be neglected only if
/r2  1/(gy mn ) is smallhence the requirement of large gy mn .

gauge theory at large n is dominated by planar graphs, so one way to regard the relation

zy m [0]  maximum

es[]

as g2

y m n  

(9.1)

is to say that classical supergravity captures the large gy mn asymptotics of planar graphs.

104

one would hope to improve (9.1) to an exact equality by replacing the right hand side with a full
quantum theory of gravity: namely, type iib string theory in the d3-brane background. as mentioned
in chapter 1, there are formidable diculties standing in the way of formulating string theory in a
background involving ramond-ramond elds. ramond-ramond elds enter into the world-sheet
description of strings as bilinears of spin elds with additional superghost dressings which maintain
two-dimensional superconformal invariance. at the time of writing we are unaware of any proposals
for formulating a ghost-free non-linear sigma-model action.

notwithstanding the technical diculties, we can ask what stringy corrections to (9.1) might be
like. by including the full tower of massive excited string states, a string theory description would
reintroduce the non-chiral gauge theory operators that were argued in chapter 8 to freeze out in the
large coupling limit on account of large anomalous dimensions. the ability to make /r2 arbitrary
is precisely what we need in order to get down to weak coupling where perturbative gauge theory is
reliable. special quantities, like schwinger terms in the opes of conserved currents, can be expected
to be protected against radiative corrections, as we saw in the case of the central charge in chapter 7.
tests of the gravitygauge theory correspondence that rely in no way on symmetries, anomalies, or
non-renormalizations are much harder to come by. this is perhaps typical of duality conjectures:
expansion parameters get shued in such a way that what is simple on one side of the duality is very
dicult to verify on the other.
one can nevertheless try to see what improvements to (9.1) might be the most accessible to cal-
culation. one idea is to compute the leading 1/(gy mn ) correction to the entropy from the rst
 correction to supergravity (which comes at order 3 for type iib). another possibility is to con-
sider 1/n corrections via low order loop eects in quantized supergravity which are not troubled by
divergences. for example, as explained in [19], the u (1) part of the world-volume gauge theory is
not visible in the ads geometry, because the low-dimension conformal elds in the u (1) sector would
correspond to tachyons violating the breitenlohner-freedman bound. consequently, supergravity in
the throat region should reect a central charge c = (n 2  1)/4 rather than the c = n 2/4 calculated
in chapter 7. this slight dierence may be one of the simplest 1/n 2 eects. to see it in supergravity,
one would want to evaluate the two-point function of the stress-tensor via graviton propagation in the
ads geometry, but including one-loop corrections to the propagator. the identication of parameters
discussed in the previous paragraph guarantees that this will lead to some 1/n 2 eect; whether it
comes out with the correct coecient is a check on whether (9.1) can be extended beyond the level
of planar graphs.

another direction, building upon the results in chapters 6 and 8, is to consider what eects in
the world-volume theory become visible when one considers the full three-brane metric rather than
just its near-horizon limit. crudely speaking, the ads space is cut o at a radius r by the
asymptotically at portion of the three-brane metric. modes of the supergravity elds with r  1
do not see the eects of this cut-o because they approach a pure power law dependence at radii
much larger than r2. supergravity eects at these low energies seem to be all that is relevant to the
renormalizable gauge theory on the world-volume. the full world-volume theory (presumably some
non-abelian version of the dbi action) contains non-renormalizable terms which contribute to greens
functions with inverse powers of r. by considering the double scaling limit (6.2) with nite r, one
should be able to probe the complicated dynamics of the full dbi theory. the r  0 limit is all
that is explored by the analysis of the near-horizon geometry. in [200] the leading corrections in r
to s-wave minimal scalar absorption were shown to correspond to the eects of breaking conformal
invariance in the world-volume theory by retaining the leading non-renormalizable term in the dbi
action. further work in this direction has begun to suggest the appearance of anomalous dimensions
at nite r for what in the conformal theory are protected operators whose dimensions are xed by
the superconformal algebra.

a better understanding of the double scaling limit may also be interesting from the point of view
of black hole physics, for the following reason. in dynamical processes like absorption or emission, one

105

usually restricts to low energy. the physics picked out by this limit is the same as by the decoupling
limit (where gravity is taken arbitrarily weak), the throat limit (where attention is focused on the
near-horizon geometry), and the renormalizable gauge theory lagrangian on the world-volume. to
put it another way, the universal low-energy behavior (1.3) of the cross sections has to do with a
renormalizable theory on the brane decoupled from the bulk. if we instead we explore the double
scaling limit with (r)4  n 4 held nite, then the cross-sections retain  dependence. we may
speculate that couplings between the brane and the bulk are being studied in a controlled way. the
world-volume gauge theory is now non-renormalizable, and its time evolution cannot be regarded as
strictly unitary because of the ultraviolet divergences. the energy scale of the non-renormalizable
eects is 1/r.
is it possible that this divergence-related non-unitarity is related to the apparent
lack of unitarity in the evolution of black holes? if so, then string theory resolves information loss
by providing a perfectly unitary description of the system at the (much higher) energy scale 1/.
this discussion has focused on the d3-brane, but in principle such considerations should extend to
the eective string model. as mentioned before, the string theory description becomes less simple
because of the complicated structure of the d1-d5 bound state. however, non-unitarity issues may
be more straightforward to analyze in 1 + 1 dimensions.
