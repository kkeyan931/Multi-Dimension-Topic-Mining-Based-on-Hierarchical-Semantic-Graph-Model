(5) make general observations concerning relation even poisson bracket original phase-space manifold associated (grassmann-odd) antibracket super path space induced : 0 (t), zb (cid:0)za 0 (t), zb (cid:0)za 1 (t), zb (cid:0)za 0 (t)(cid:1) = 0 1 (t)(cid:1) = ab(z0)(t t) 1 (t)(cid:1) = zc 1 c ab(z0)(t t) . ab(z) = (cid:8)za, zb(cid:9). antibracket obviously carries one unit grassmann parity one unit ghost number. another important property (5) following: let f (z) function phase space let functional f dened (6) f  = z dtd f (z(t, )) , grassmann parity f opposite f . functions f, g phase space (7) (f, g) z dtd {f, g} . f, g corresponding functionals obtained (6). particular, grassmann-odd function f satises hamiltonian master equation {f, f } = 0 corresponding grassmann- even functional f = r dtd f satises bv master equation respect antibracket: (f, f ) = 0 . (8) obvious generalization, even f = f (z, t, ) function original phase space also explicitly depends time super-partner , f still satises hamiltonian master equation {f, f } = 0 , corresponding functional f = r dtdf (z(t, ), t, ) also satises master equation respect antibracket (7). see section 4 details. superfield brst charge master action 3 2. superfield realization phase space antifield formalism let us consider system rst class constraints. thus grassmann-odd brst generator = (z) hamiltonian h = h(z), taken satisfy (9) {, } = 0 {h, } = 0 . combine nicely one grassmann-odd object q  (10) q(z, ) (z) + h(z) , nilpotent due eq.

(11) also assume boundary terms q (14) z dtd dq = z dt (z0) = 0 , follows previous considerations action satises master equation (15) (s, s) = 0 . simple integrate additional -variable eq. (12), one nds: (16) s = z dt  . except last term, simply conventional phase-space action constraints. let us rewrite last term: (17) za 1 a(z0(t)) = z 0a{za 0 , } , 0a zb dened z 1 ba. general phase space action extended antields satisfy classical bv master equation (s, s) = 0. note variables za 0a canonically conjugate within antibracket, precise identication plays role eld antield becomes apparent upon identication ghost number . assignments follow automatically supereld approach. 0 z make considerations concrete, let us consider case rst class constraints t(z) usual algebra (18) {t, t} = c , {t, h0} = v . simplicity assume original phase space variables bosonic. according bfv prescription  one introduces ghosts c together conjugate momenta p, brst charge extended hamiltonian given = tc 1 2 p c cc + . . . superfield brst charge master action 4 (19) h = h0 + pv c + . . . dots denote higher order terms expansion h respect ghost momenta p. extended poisson bracket given coordinates (20) (cid:8)qi, pj(cid:9) = j , {c, p} = . allow phase space coordinates depend . let us write explicitly expansion respect : (21) qi = qi c = c 0 pi 0 u pi = p0 p = u + q + c . chosen dening signs order facilitate comparison existing literature. according choice gh() = 1 ghost numbers new variables read (22) gh(qi gh(c gh(p0 gh(q 0) = 0 , 0 ) = 1 , gh(u) = 0 , gh(c ) = 0 , ) = 1 , gh(pi ) = 2 , gh(u ) = 1 , ) = 1 . action (16) takes form (23) = r dt  , (24) = z dt (p0 qi 0 h0 + tu) , corresponding system consideration. indeed, terms enter ghost number zero variables, thus understood bv formalism initial action. making use ghost number assignments (22) also easy infer gauge generators eq.

(26) ghost number assignments are: (34) gh(qi 0) = gh(pi) = 0 , gh(c) = gh() = 1 , gh(p) = gh(i) = 1 , gh() = 2 , gh() = 2 . poisson bracket (27) becomes explicitly (35) 0, pj} = {qi j , 0 , p} = {c , {i, j} = j , {, } = , substituting (32) (28) integrating arrive (36) = iis0 + piri c 0 iri + i(j j ri )c 0 1 2 p c c 0 c 0 c c 0 + . . . , dots denote higher order terms variables p, . see identied ghost momenta. eq. (36) formally identied brst charge system constraints. using ghost number assignments easy see c 0 ghosts associated rst class constraints piri , , p conjugate momenta. variables simply ghosts ghosts momenta associated reducible constraints is. precise, lagrangian gauge generators ri reducibility functions constraints is0 due noether identity ri indeed enters (36). emphasized identications algebraic sense only: analogue ordinary time coordinate hamiltonian system. is0 = 0. corresponding term iri interesting open question concerns role quantum corrections master action s. suppose expand solution full quantum master equation (37) 1 2 (s, s) = is powers , insert full solution denition (28). nilpotency condition (29) broken -corrections right hand side. interpretation -corrections brst charge ? perhaps related canonical quantization poisson bracket corresponding hamiltonian quantum master equation  = 0. case, question deserves detailed study. 4. geometry super path space useful clarify geometrical meaning structures entering superspace formu- lations, view greater generality. particular, instructive see antibracket usual poisson bracket enter equal footing. section, bit abstract, nd convenient even use symbol two, namely m. one must course keep mind odd even brackets odd even grassmann parities, respectively. let symplectic manifold (which even odd), let m corresponding poisson bracket antibracket, depending grassmann parity. denote n dimension grassmann parity bracket m, i.e., (38) (m) = (f ) + (g) + , exchange relation, leibniz rule jacobi identity neatly summarized, brackets, (39) m = (1)((f )+)((g)+) m m = m h + (1)((f )+))(g)g m m ]m = m , h]m + m ]m (1)((f )+)((g)+) . superfield brst charge master action 7 functions f, g h m.

(50) turn odd nilpotent vector eld d, considered acting functionals, hamiltonian vector eld hamiltonian (51) c = z dt vada . choosing darboux coordinates p, q one arrives standard form r dtp0 qi 0. thus see hamiltonian action (12) precisely geometrical form (48) f super brst charge + h. dierence f case explicitly depends . case inverse construction sec. 3 one chooses one dimensional space grassmann-odd coordinate antisymplectic manifold. using general formula (40) one arrives directly explicit form odd path space poisson bracket (27). case simply take = 0 f master action eq.
