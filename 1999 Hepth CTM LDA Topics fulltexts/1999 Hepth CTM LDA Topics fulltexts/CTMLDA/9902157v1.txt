1 introduction

quantum statistics, as the name suggests, is the way that the quantum mechanical
properties of particles inuence their statistical mechanics. two features of quantum
mechanics are crucial for the dierence between classical and quantum statistics: the
indistinguishability of quantum particles and the nite room that exists in a given
domain of the phase space of a quantum system.

the rst feature can be incorporated by hand into classical statistical mechanics
(although there is no underlying principle for doing so) and this will resolve the
gibbs paradox, although by itself it would change little else. the second feature
can likewise be incorporated in an ad hoc way, which will assign a unique value to
the additive constant of the entropy of a classical system, but again without further
physical impact. it is the combination of the two that produces nontrivial results,
especially in the domain where quantum phenomena prevail, that is, high densities
or low temperatures.

the statistics of observed particles seem to be exhausted by the two well-known
cases of bose and fermi. in this sense, the quest for more exotic possibilities seems
to be a bit academic or even quixotic. it is, nevertheless, of interest to explore the
possibilities as a way of obtaining a more lucid eective description of the dynamics
of (otherwise normal) interacting particles. in this sense, we are trading one kind of
intuition for another, hoping to make a prot in the bargain.

there are several approaches to dening or implementing quantum statistics.
they are roughly classied into fundamental (group theoretic, operator etc.) and
phenomenological (statistical). while exploring them we must keep in mind that,
at the end of the day, we should provide a realization, that is, a system which
is (more or less) physical and exhibits these statistics through its dynamics. the
less the number of space dimensions, the more easy it is to nd such realizations.
the concept itself of statistics, actually, depends crucially on the dimensionality
of space. topological considerations allow for generalized abelian statistics in 2+1
dimensions [1, 2, 3, 4]. such particles, called anyons, have found use in the physics of
the quantum hall eect and (probaby) high-temperature superconductivity. there
are excellent reviews on anyons [5] and we will not deal with them here.

in these lectures the bulk of the material will concern one-dimensional situations,
although some considerations in principle applicable to any dimension will also be
included. the purpose is to present enough of the concepts and material on the
subject to spur the interest of the reader for further study. you are warned that
all formulae in these lectures are simply mnemonics of the correct results: mistakes
abound! (the written version is only marginally better.) one standard exercise
proposed here is to rederive all results, xing the signs and factors in the process.
hopefully substance survived the sloppyness.

so, right to the task.

2

2 permutation group approach

as a way of introduction and covering standard ground, we will study the context in
which statistics initially arose, namely the permutation group in quantum mechanics
[6]-[14]. the main emphasis will be in connecting to the path integral and pointing
the possibilities for generalizations within this approach.

the main themes of this lecture are:

a) eliminating the gauge multiplicity of states originating from particle permuta-
tions. this will, in general, lead to the appearance of internal degrees of freedom
that are the residue of identities (distinguishability) of particles.
b) implementing the path integral for identical particles. their indistinguishability
calls for including paths that lead to any permutation of the nal position. deter-
mining the right weights of these sectors (which are not necessarily phases) will x
the statistics.

2.1 realization of the reduced hilbert space

we will work in the rst-quantized picture, in which the number of particles is
xed but the particles are nevertheless taken to be indistinguishable. this is to
be contrasted to the weaker statement that the particles are merely identical. to
x the ideas, let us call {xi} the coordinates of these particles, with i = 1 . . . n
enumerating the particles, and assume, for now, that there are no internal degrees
of freedom. the xi can be in a space of any dimension. the hilbert space of this
system is spanned by the position eigenstates |x1, . . . xn > |x >. let us also dene
the operators p  sn that permute the quantum numbers of the particles. there
are n! such operators forming the permutation (or symmetric) group of n objects
sn . the collection of the above states for a set of distinct xi transforms in the
n!-dimensional regular (dening) representation of sn

p|x > |p x >= |xp (1), . . . xp (n ) >

(1)

notice that if any of the coordinates xi coincide the above is not the full dening
representation any more. the set of such states, however, is of measure zero (the
coordinate space assumed continuous) and thus they can be safely ignored. (we
assume that there are no interactions singular at coincidence points that might
dynamically make such states of nonzero weight.)

if the particles are identical then the hamiltonian treats them all equally and

thus we have

[h, p ] = 0

(2)

for any p . if however, the particles are also indistinguishable, this means that there
is no physical way to ever be able to tell the particles from each other. thus, not
only the hamiltonian, but all conceivable perturbations of this hamiltonian must
commute with the permutation operators. (these perturbations would correspond

3

to various devices, dies and other tricks that we would attach to the system in our
eort to tell the particles from each other.) in short, the permutation operators
must commute with all physical observables a:

[a, p ] = 0

(3)

when such an operator p commutes with all (physical) operators in a system we
have a superselection rule: there is no possible transition or interference between
states corresponding to dierent eigenvalues of this operator and thus we can choose
a subspace with a xed eigenvalue and stay with it for ever. (this is also called
picking a theta-vacuum in particle gauge theories.) in our case, there is a whole set
of operators commuting with everything else (the group sn ) and thus the generalized
theta-vacuum states consist of irreducible representations (irreps) of sn . further,
states that are connected to each other through the action of operators p cannot
be distinguished by any physical operator and therefore must be identied as a
unique physical state. in other words, the permutation group must be viewed as
a discrete gauge group producing unphysical transformations, that is, copies of the
same physical system. we must, therefore:

 project on a subspace corresponding to a particular irrep r of sn
 identify elements within this subspace grouping in the same irrep as a unique

physical state.
the above procedure and choice of r corresponds to a choice of statistics.

we will implement this in the coordinate representation |x1, . . . xn > |x >.
projecting the hilbert space to an irrep r of sn amounts to keeping only linear
combinations of states within this multiplet that transform in r, that is,

|a; x >= xp

ca(p )p|x > ,

a = 1, . . . dr , dr = dim(r).

(4)

where the sum is over all elements of the permutation group and ca(p ) are appro-
priately chosen coecients. if we denote with rab(p ) the matrix elements of the
permutation p in the representations r,

p|a, x >= xb

rab(p 1)|b, x >

(5)

(the appearance of p 1 above is necessary so that successive transformations com-
bine in the right order.)

the dening representation decomposes into irreducible components, classied
by young tableaux, each appearing with a certain multiplicity. should we keep only
one irrep out of each multiplicity or the whole multiplet? to decide it, note that if
instead of the base state |x > for the construction of the states |a, x > we choose
a dierent permutation po|x >, then although the new states |a, pox > constructed
through (5) still transform in the irrep r, in general they are not linear combinations
of |a, x > but rather span a dierent copy of r. since we can continuously move

4

in the conguration space from |x > to po|x >, we conclude that we must keep
all irreps r within each multiplet. (in other words, although for each point in the
hilbert space |x > this multiplet is reducible, the ber of these representations over
the hilbert space is connected and irreducible.)

to realize explicitly the above, we construct the states

|ab, x >= s dr

n! xp

rab(p )p|x >

(6)

using the group property of the representation r(p1)r(p2) = r(p1p2), we deduce
that under the action of the group sn and under change of base point x the above
states transform as:

p|ab, x >= xc

rac(p 1)|cb, x > ,

|ab, p x >= xc

rcb(p 1)|ac, x >

(7)

thus we see that the rst index in these states labels the dierent elements of a
single irrep r, while the second index labels the dierent equivalent irreps in the
multiplet. since both indices take dr values, we recover the standard result that
each irrep of sn is embedded in the dening representation a number of times equal
to its dimension.

consider now the matrix element < ab, x|a|cd, y >, where a is any physical
operator, that is, any operator commuting with all elements p of sn . substituting
the denition (6) and using the unitarity of p (p  = p 1) and of r (r
ab(p ) =
rba(p 1)) we obtain, after a change in summation variable,

< ab, x|a|cd, y >=

dr

n! xp,p ,e

rbe(p )rea(p 1)rcd(p ) < x|ap |y >

(8)

using further the orthogonality (shurs) relation (see, e.g., [15])

rab(p )rcd(p 1) =

n!
dr

adbc

xp

we nally obtain

< ab, x|a|cd, y >= xp

acrbd(p ) < x|a|p y >

(9)

(10)

it is clear from (10) that there is no possible transition between states with dierent
rst index. further, for states with the same index, the amplitude is independent
of the index. thus, the rst index a in the state |ab, x > propagates trivially. since
this is the index that corresponds to the dierent but physically equivalent states
within each irrep r, we conclude that the required projection of the hilbert space
to the physical subspace amounts to simply omitting this index from all states.
(that is, freeze this index to the same xed value for all states of the theory; no

5

physical quantity will ever depend on the choice of this value.) on the other hand,
the second index, corresponding to dierent equivalent irreps, does not propagate
trivially and must, as argued before, be kept. we are led therefore to the physical
states |ba, x > |a, x >.

let us rst choose a = 1. then (10) provides the overlap between the states

< ab, x|cd, y >= xp

acrbd(p )(x  p y)

(11)

for x in the neighborhood of y it is p = 1 which contributes to the normalization, for
which rbd(1) = bd and we recover the standard continuous normalization between
the states.

choose, now, a = eiht, where h is the hamiltonian, and thus nd the propa-
gator g(ab, x; cd, y|t) between the states of the system. projecting to the physical
states |ba, x > |a, x > we obtain the propagator

gr(a, x; b, y|t) = xp

rab(p ) g(x, p y; t)

(12)

where g(x, p y; t) = < x|eihtp|y > is the usual many-body propagator. we
note that, due to the transformation property (7), the states |a, p x > are linear
combinations of states |a, x >. therefore, projecting down to the physical subspace
corresponding to r amounts to trading the original n! copies of physically equivalent
states |p x > for a number dr of global internal degrees of freedom for the system,
labeled by the index a.

2.2 path integral and generalized statistics

it is now easy to write down the path integral corresponding to identical particles
quantized in the r-irrep of sn . g(x, p y; t) can be expressed as an n-body path
integral in the standard way, with particles starting from positions xi and ending
in positions p yi = yp (i). since all permutations of particle positions are physically
equivalent, (12) instructs us to sum over all sectors where particles end up in such
permuted positions, weighted with the factors rab(p ) depending on the internal
degrees of freedom of the initial and nal states. from (6, 11) we can write the
completeness relation within the physical subspace

ir = z dn x

n! xa |a, x >< a, x|

(13)

and with the use of (13) it is easy to prove that the above path integral is unitary,
that is,

z dn y
n! xb

g(a, x; b, y|t) g(b, y; c, z|t) = g(a, x; c, z|t + t)

(14)

we can extend this construction to a more general class of statistics, which
includes the cases of the so-called parabosons and parafermions as special cases.

6

the generalization consists in allowing more than one irrep to appear in the hilbert
space, and keeping more than one state in each irrep. this seems unmotivated
and against the spirit of the reduction by the full superselection rule, but it is
consistent. it could mean, for instance, that the particles have some hidden internal
degrees of freedom accounting for the extra degeneracy, which are invisible to the
present hamiltonian but may become dynamically relevant later. (this, then, would
augment the space of physical operators in the theory.) the most general situation
is that we include cr states from each irrep r. the statistics is xed by the set of
non-negative integers cr.

the generalization of the results to this more general situation is straightforward.
the internal degree of freedom now takes values a = (r, a, ), where a = 1, . . . dr
labels the inequivalent r-irreps and and  = 1, . . . cr labels the states kept within
each irrep. (a, ) constitute the internal degrees of freedom within each irrep. so,

overall, a takes pr crdr dierent values. the propagator (and corresponding path

integral) is obviously

where

gs(a, x; b, y|t) = xp

s(p )ab g(x, p y; t)

s(p )ab = ra,rb  (ra)ab(p )

(15)

(16)

the denition of parabosons (parafermions) of order p is that we include once all
irreps with up to p rows (columns) in their young tableaux. we have, therefore,
cr = 1 for such irreps and cr = 0 for the rest. we note that the irreps for
parafermions are the duals of those for parabosons (the dual of a tableau is the
tableau with rows and columns interchanged). in an appropriate basis, the repre-
sentation matrices of dual irreps r, r are real and satisfy

rab(p ) = (1)p rab(p )

(17)
where (1)p is the parity of the permutation. we arrive then at the relation between
the weights for parabosons and parafermions of order p:
spf (p )ab = (1)p spb(p )ab

(18)

this extends a similar relation for ordinary fermions and bosons [13], for which there
are no internal degrees of freedom and sb(p ) = 1.

from the path integral we can evaluate the partition function, by simply shifting
to the euclidean periodic propagator ge() = eh and summing over all initial
and nal states, with the measure implied by (13). given that

we get the expression in terms of the characters of sn

raa(p ) = trr(p ) = r(p )

xa

zs(t ) = z dn x

n! xp

s(p ) < x|ge()|p x >

7

(19)

(20)

where

we also note the inversion formula

s(p ) = xr

cr r(p )

cr =

1

n! xp

s(p )r(p )

(21)

(22)

which allows to recover cr if we know s(p ) for all permutations. the interpretation
in terms of a periodic euclidean path integral is obvious. the characters r(p ) are
a set of integers, and thus the statistical factors s(p ) weighing each topological
sector of the path integral are (positive or negative) integers. in the case of para-
bosons of any order p, however, we note that the statistical weights are positive (or
zero) integers. the ones for parafermions can be either positive or negative, as given
by

spf (p ) = (1)p spb(p ) , spb(p )  0

(23)

we do not have a general formula for spb(p ) for arbitrary p. for non-interacting
particles the partition function can be expressed in terms of the characters of su(n)
(shurs functions) [16, 17].

we note here that the case of distinguishable particles (innite statistics [10,
18, 19]), is also included in this formalism, by accepting all states in each irrep, that
is, cr = dr. since r appears exactly dr times in the dening representation of sn ,
s(p ) above becomes the trace of p in the dening representation. but all p 6= 1 are
o-diagonal in the dening representation, so we get sinf (p ) = n! p,1, recovering

z(t ) = z dn x < x|ge()|x >

(24)

for distinguishable particles.

2.3 cluster decomposition and factorizability

parastatistics particle obey the cluster decomposition principle, in the sense that the
density matrix obtained by tracing over a subset of particles which decouple from
the system can be constructed as a possible density matrix of the reduced system of
remaining particles [8, 12]. from (21), however, we see that the partition function
of two dynamically isolated sets of particles n1 and n2 does not factorize into the
product of the two partition functions, since the statistical weights s(p ) in general
do not factorize into s(p1)s(p2) when p is the product of two commuting elements
p1 and p2. equivalently, this means that the occupation degeneracy d(p1, p2, . . .)
of p1, p2, . . . particles occupying a set of levels 1, 2, . . . does not factorize into the
product of individual occupation degeneracies for each level i. there is an eective
coupling between the particles. this has important physical implications. if the
two sets of particles are totally isolated, it does not make sense to evaluate the
partition function of the total system, since the statistical distribution can never

8

relax to the one predicted by that partition function. the individual partition
functions of the subsystems are the relevant ones.
if, however, the two sets are
only weakly coupled, then initially each set will distribute according to its reduced
partition function, but after some relaxation time (depending on the strength of
the coupling between the two sets) they will relax to the joint distribution function,
which, we stress, will not even approximately equal the product of the individual
ones. thus, cluster decomposition holds in an absolute sense but fails in a more
realistic sense. in contrast, fermions and bosons respect cluster decomposition in
both senses.

we summarize by pointing out that the most general statistics of the type ex-
amined here is parametrized by any of three possible sets of numbers. the rst is,
as just stated, the number of states cr accepted for each irrep r of sn . the second
is the statistical weights s(p ) appearing in the partition function (euclidean path
integral). these weights are invariant under conjugation of p  qp q1. finally,
we could use the degeneracy of a many-body occupancy state, call it d[pi], as our
denition. (this was the starting point of the rst known attempt to generalized
statistics, the gentile statistics.
[20]) these three sets contain as many elements
as the partitions of n and are all equivalent.

what are the restrictions or criteria to be imposed on the above parameters?
the rst one is unitarity, that is, the existence of a well-dened hilbert space with
positive metric. this requires that cr be non-negative (no negative norm states)
integers (no fractional dimension states). the other will be what we call strong
cluster decomposition principle or factorizability, that the partition function of
isolated systems factorizes. this is a physical criterion, rather than a consistency
requirement. to summarize:

 unitarity: cr non-negative integers
 factorizability: s(p ) = qncycles(p ) s(n)

or d[pi] = qi d(pi)

factorizability, in particular, implies that the grand partition function in the case of
noninteracting particles will be obtained by exponentiating the sum of all connected
path integrals (p a cyclic permutation of degree n) with weights s(n)/n (1/n is
the symmetry factor of this path integral, corresponding to cyclic relabelings of the
particles). the grand partition function will factorize into a product of partition
functions for each level i. thus, s(n) are cluster coecients connected to d(n) in
the standard way



xp=0

d(p)zp = exp  
xn=1

s(n)

n

zn!

(25)

the above formula, in fact, provides the easiest way to relate d[pi] and s(p ) in the
general case (no strong cluster property) but we will not enter into this.

if we assume that s(1) = d(1) = 1, then it is easy to verify that the only solution
of the above two criteria is ordinary fermions and bosons. the situation is dierent,
however, when s(1) = d(1) = q > 1 (this would mean, e.g., that the particles come
a priori in q dierent avors). the possibilities are manifold. all these generalized

9

statistics share the following generic features:

(indeed, d(1, 1, . . . 1) = d(1)n = qn.)

 the degeneracy of the state where n particles occupy dierent levels is qn.
 if state a can be obtained from state b by lumping together particles that
previously occupied dierent levels, then d(a)  d(b). (e.g., d(3)  d(2, 1) 
d(1, 1, 1).)
the above possibilities include the obvious special cases of q1 bosonic avors and
q2 fermionic ones (q1 + q2 = q), for which s(n) = q1  (1)nq2, along with many
other. as an example, we give the rst few degeneracies for many-particle level
occupation for all statistics with q = 2:

d(1) = 2, d(2) = 4, d(3) = 8
d(1) = 2, d(2) = 3, d(3) = 6, 5, 4(b + b)
d(1) = 2, d(2) = 2, d(3) = 4, 3, 2(b + f ), 1, 0
d(1) = 2, d(2) = 1, d(3) = 2, 1, 0(f + f )
d(1) = 2, d(2) = 0, d(3) = 0
the specic choices denoted by b + b, b + f and f + f are the ones corre-
sponding to two bosonic, one bosonic and one fermionic, and two fermionic avors
respectively. the topmost statistics could be termed superbosons and the bottom
one superfermions of order 2. we also remark here that the (p, q)-statistics
introduced in [12] can be realized as particles with p bosonic and q fermionic avors,
where we identify each multiplet transforming irreducibly under the supergroup
su(p, q) as a unique physical state.

finally, we comment on gentile statistics [20]. the rule is simply that up to p
particles can be put in each single-particle level. this corresponds to d(n) = 1 for
n  p, and d(n) = 0 otherwise. this has been criticized [14] on the grounds that x-
ing the allowed occupations for each single-particle state is not a statement invariant
under change of single-particle basis. it should be clear from this lecture that any
statistics satisfying the unitarity requirement is consistent and basis-independent.
therefore, gentile statistics must violate unitarity. indeed, it is easy to check that
all weights cr for such statistics are integers (this is generic for all statistics with
integer d(n)), but not necessarily positive. in the specic case of p = 2, e.g., where
up to double occupancy of each level is allowed, the degeneracies of each irrep of sn
(parametrized, as usual, by the length of young tableau rows) up to n = 5 are

c2 = c21 = c22 = c221 = 1, c111 = c1111 = c2111 = 1, else cr = 0

(26)

we see that representations 111, 1111, 2111 correspond to ghost (negative norm)
states and their eect is to subtract (rather than add) degrees of freedom.

in conclusion, we see that the permutation group approach to generalizing statis-
tics gives results of rather limited interest. the resulting statistics can be though
of as particles with internal degrees of freedom, with perhaps some superselection
rule that forbids the manifestation of all possible internal states. to nd something
more exotic we must consider other approaches.

10

3 one-dimensional systems: calogero model

let us now specialize in one dimension and see in what dierent angle we can
approach the problem of statistics. the peculiarity of a lineal world is that, kine-
matically, particles cannot exchange positions without bumping onto each other.
this has tangible physical consequences and makes the notion of statistics in one
dimension rather special. lets see:

a. since congurations related by particle permutation are gauge copies of
each other, we could gauge x and restrict ourselves to only one gauge copy. in
one dimension the conguration space of n indistinguishable particles breaks into
n! sectors classied by the ordering of the coordinates: x1 < . . . < xn and its
permutations. restricting to one sector we are faced with the problem of boundary
conditions on the wavefunction at the boundary of this space, when two or more
coordinates become equal, so that we preserve hermiticity. the choice of boundary
conditions can be interpreted as a choice of statistics. we mention two possibilities:

a) a linear local boundary condition:

 + n|boundary = 0

(27)

where n is the normal derivative at the boundary [21]. clearly  = 0 (neumann)
corresponds to fermions; we can analytically extend  in the other sectors in an
antisymmetric way. similarly,  =  (dirichlet) corresponds to bosons. any other
choice would be some intermediate statistics. , however, introduces a length scale
and is not a very satisfactory statistics denition. at any rate, this system is equiv-
alent to bosons with a delta-function two-body interaction of strength proportional
to 1.

b) fix the analytical behavior of  at the boundary as

  x as x  0

(28)

this way the probability current would scale as n  x21 and would vanish if
 > 1
2 or  = 0. this would dene the statistics through the dimensionless parameter
. notice that this behavior would require a two-body potential behaving like (1)
near coincidence points. this is the rst glimpse at the inverse-square potential
arising in the statistics context.

x2

b. we could, alternatively, examine the scattering phase  between particles. at

high relative energies the two-body scattering phase approaches the values

  0 for bosons,

   for fermions

(29)

irrespective of the details of their interaction (provided it is not too singular). the
corresponding many-body phase is the sum of two-body ones. so, if we see a system
where this phase goes to the value  we can interpret it as one with generalized
statistics of order  [21].

11

as we shall see, this denition also leads to the inverse-square potential. there
are hints from algebraic considerations also pointing to this type of potential [22,
23, 24]. this is enough motivation, at any rate, to examine particles with that type
of two-body interaction potentials. this is known as the calogero model, or, more
completely, as the calogero-sutherland-moser (csm) model [25, 26, 27].

3.1 the calogero-sutherland-moser model

this is a system of nonrelativistic identical particles on the line with pairwise inverse-
square interactions. the basic hamiltonian is

h =

1
2

n

xi=1

p2

i +xi<j

g

(xi  xj)2

(30)

this is the free (scattering) calogero system on the line [25]. the particle masses
m have been scaled to unity. this is the only scale-free two-body potential that
one can have (the potential, quantum mechanically, scales like the kinetic term).
an external harmonic oscillator potential can also be added to conne the system
without spoiling its features. this is the harmonic calogero model. alternatively,
one could consider a periodic version of the system. the particles now interact
through innitely many periodic copies of themselves and the two-body potential
becomes

(we scaled the length of the box to 2). this is the sutherland model [26]. there
are other versions of this class of models that will not concern us here. the classic
report [28] covers these systems in detail. see also [29] for recent mathematical
work.

classically the coupling constant g should be positive to ensure particles are not
sucked into each other. quantum mechanically the uncertainty principle works in
our favor and the minimum allowed value for g is g =  1
4 (we put henceforth h = 1).
for later convenience, it is useful to parametrize g in the fashion

g = (  1)

(32)

in which case the minimum value is naturally obtained for  = 1
2.

the above system is integrable, which means that there are n integrals of motion
in convolution, that is, n functions on phase space with vanishing poisson brackets:

{in, im} = 0 , n, m = 1 . . . n

(33)

for the scattering system (no external potential) i1 is the total momentum, i2 is the
total energy amd the higher in are higher polynomials in the momenta also involving
the two-body potentials. we will not belabor here their form nor prove integrability

at this point, since this is beyond our scope and will, at any rate, be dealt with in
later lectures. we will only state without proof the qualitative features relevant to
our purposes.

the key interesting property of the above model, that sets it apart from other
merely integrable models, is that, both classically and quantum mechanically, it
mimics as closely as possible a system of free particles. let us rst look at its classical
behavior. the motion is a scattering event. asymptotically, at times t = , the
particles are far away, the potentials drop o to zero and motion is free. when they
come together, of course, they interact and steer away from their straight paths.
interestingly, however, when they are done interacting, they resume their previous
free paths as if nothing happened. not only are their asymptotic momenta the same
as before scattering, but also the asymptotic positions (scattering parameters) are
the same. there is no time delay of the particles at the scattering region. the only
eect is an overall reshuing of the particles. thus, if one cannot tell particles from
each other, and if one only looks at scattering properties, the system looks free!

this behavior carries over to quantum mechanics. the asymptotic scattering
momenta are the same before and after scattering. the fact that there is, further,
no time delay translates into the fact that the scattering phase shift is independent
of the momenta. thus it can only be a function of the coupling constant and the
total number of particles. it is, actually, a very suggestive function:

sc =

n(n  1)

2



(34)

thus the phase is simply  times the total number of two-body exchanges that
would occur in the scattering of free particles. clearly the case  = 0 would corre-
spond to free bosons and  = 1 to free fermions (for these two values the potential
vanishes and the system is, indeed, free). for any other value we can interpret this
system as free particles with generalized statistics .

a word on the permutation properties of this system is in order. the inverse-
square potential is quantum mechanically impenetrable, and thus the ordinary
statistics of the particles (symmetry of the wavefunction) is irrelevant: if the particles
are in one of the n! ordering sectors they will stay there for ever. the wavefunction
could be extended to the other sectors in a symmetric, antisymmetric or any other
way, but this is irrelevant for physics. no interference between the sectors will ever
take place. all states have a trivial n! degeneracy. (that is to say all states in all
irreps of sn have the same physical properties.) permutation statistics are therefore
irrelevant and we can safely talk about the eective statistics as produced by their
coupling constant .

the behavior of the wavefunction near coincidence points in as in (28). this
system, thus, satises both our boundary condition and scattering phase criteria for
generalized statistics.

let us also review the properties of the conned systems. in the presence of an

13

external harmonic potential of the form

2x2
i

v = xi

the energy spectrum of a system of uncoupled particles would be

e =

n
2

ni

 +xi

the ni are nonnegative integers satisfying

n1  . . .  nn for bosons
n1 < . . . < nn for fermions

the actual spectrum of this model is

e =

n
2

 + 

n(n  1)

2

ni

 +xi

(35)

(36)

(37)

(38)

(39)

with ni being pseudo-excitation numbers obeying bosonic selection rules: ni  ni+1.
dening the quasi-excitation numbers

we can check that the expression of the spectrum in terms of the ni is identical to
the free one (36) but with the quantum numbers now obeying the selection rule

ni = ni + (i  1)

(40)

ni  ni+1  

(41)

this is a sort of exclusion principle that requires the particle quantum numbers to
be at least a distance  apart (as contrasted to 1 for fermions and 0 for bosons).
again, a generalized statistics interpretation is manifest [30].

let us clarify that the above numbers ni are no more integers. they do, however,
increase in integer increments. the rule is that the ground state is determined by
the minimal allowed nonnegative values for ni obeying (41) while the excited states
are obtained by all integer increments of these values that still obey (41).

the periodic (sutherland) model has similar properties. its spectrum is

1

e = xi

k2

i + xi<j

(kj  ki) + 2 n(n 2  1)

24

(42)

with the pseudo-momenta ki being integers satisfying bosonic rules: ki  ki+1. this
looks rather dierent than the corresponding free expression (for  = 0). dening,
however, again quasi-momenta

pi = ki + (cid:18)i 

n + 1

2 (cid:19)

14

(43)

we can check that the expression for the spectrum becomes

1
2

p2
i

e = xi

that is, the free expression. the quasi-momenta satisfy

pi  pi+1  

(44)

(45)

that is, the same selection rule as the ni before. again, we observe a generalization of
the fermionic and bosonic selection rules corresponding to statistics . the ground
state is the minimal (nearest to zero) numbers satisfying (45) while excitations
correspond to integer increments (or decrements) of the pi still satisfying (45).

let us note that the above rule for  = 1 reproduces the fermionic spectrum of
particles with periodic boundary conditions for odd n and anti-periodic ones for
even n:
in the odd (even) n case the momenta are quantized to (half-) integers.
this has a natural interpretation: when we take a particle around the circle it goes
over n  1 other particles. if we require the phase shift of the wavefunction in this
process to agree with the minus signs picked up from the n1 fermion exchanges we
recover the previous rule. we stress that, for free particles, this is not a consistency
requirement but rather an aesthetic rule. at any rate, this is what the sutherland
model chooses to do!

in conclusion we see that the csm model can be though of as a system of particles
obeying generalized statistics. this manifests in terms of the boundary conditions of
the wavefunction, the scattering phases and, most signicantly, through a peculiar
level repulsion of their quantum numbers generalizing the fermi exclusion principle.

3.2 large-n properties of the csm model and duality

let us examine, now, the properties of the csm model as the number of particles
grows large. at zero temperature, a non-interacting fermion system would form
a fermi sea. the corresponding fermi surface in one dimension degenerates to
points. for the system in an external harmonic potential there is just one point
corresponding to the highest excitation nf = n  1. for the free periodic system
we would have two fermi momenta at pf =  n 1
2 . excitations over this ground
state are, then, conveniently classied in terms of particles (a lled fermi sea with
an isolated particle above or below) and holes (a lled sea with one unoccupied state
inside it).

interestingly, the csm model presents a similar picture. the qualitative features
of both the calogero and the sutherland model are similar, so we pick the latter as
most closely representing a gas of free particles in a box. from (45) above we see
that the ground state also forms a quasi-fermi sea (or should we call it a luttinger
sea ?) with fermi levels rescaled by a factor : pf =  n 1
2 . its minimal excitations
are analogous to the ones of a fermi sea, but not quite:

15

 a particle would be an isolated occupied quasimomentum above or below a

completely lled sea of quasimomenta. particles
are excited in units of 1 (the increments of their quasimomentum).
take up a space  in quasimomentum (since they cannot be packed closer than 
units apart).

 a hole would be an isolated empty space inside an otherwise occupied sea.
interestingly, the minimal such excitation is not obtained by removing one particle
from the sea, but rather by incrementing all quasimomenta of the sea above the
place where we want to create the hole by one unit. holes
are excited in units of . indeed, since the distance of quasimomenta in the sea is
, the possible positions of the hole are at distances  apart.
take up a unit space in quasimomentum. indeed, incrementing all quasimomenta
above a given place in the sea by two units creates two holes in that place, and so
on; by locally reshuing quasimomenta we can then separate these holes.

note that holes are not antiparticles. removing a particle for the sea creates a

gap of  spaces and, from above,  holes. the correspondence is

1 particle   holes

(46)

we already observe a sort of duality between the two types of excitations. this can
be summarized as

particle  hole ,

 

1


,

p  p

(47)

under the above, the spectrum of excitations of the model remains invariant. this
is the simplest manifestation of a coupling-constant duality that goes over to the
correlation functions and greens functions of the model [31, 32, 33, 34]. obviously,
this duality is spoiled by nonperturbative eects, since holes are conned within the
sea while there is no ceiling for particle excitations.

this concludes our brief physicists tour of the csm model. we are now going

to examine the most useful ways of analyzing this system.

4 one-dimensional systems: matrix model

identical particles can be formulated in terms of their phase space variables modulo
permutations. this leads to the symmetric group approach of section 1. we could
try other approaches. for instance, we could formulate them in terms of the eigen-
values of an n  n matrix. there is no a priori ordering of these eigenvalues, so this
certainly encodes identical particles. it is clear that the permutation symmetry of
the problem has been promoted to the continuous symmetry of unitary conjugations
of this matrix, which leaves the eigenvalues intact. this should be viewed as a gauge
symmetry and would open the road to yet another denition of statistics.

16

4.1 hermitian matrix model

with this introductory remark as motivation, let us examine a matrix model that
parallels as closely as possible particle mechanics. the kinematical variable is a
hermitian n  n matrix m and the lagrangian reads
m 2  v (m)(cid:27)

l = tr(cid:26)1

(48)

2

v (x) is a scalar potential evaluated for the matrix variable m.

clearly the above has a time-translation invariance which leads to the conserved

energy

h = tr(cid:26) 1

2

m 2 + v (m)(cid:27)

(49)

moreover, the action is invariant under time-independent unitary conjugations of
the matrix m:

this nonabelian su(n) symmetry leads to the conserved hermitian traceless matrix

m  umu 1

(50)

j = i[m,

m ]

(51)

where [ , ] denotes ordinary matrix commutator. these are the gauge charges that,
when xed, will determine the statistics of the model. but let us rst examine the
system classically. we are interested in the dynamics of the eigenvalue of m, so we
parametrize it as

m = uu 1

(52)
where u(t) is the unitary angular part of the matrix and (t) = diag{x1, . . . xn}
are the eigenvalues. clearly the conserved quantity j has to do with invariance
under rotations of the angular part of m and thus corresponds to the angular
momentum of u(t). we dene the gauge potential

m , j and the lagrangian l become, in this parametrization,

a = u 1 u

m = u (cid:16)  + [, a](cid:17) u 1
j = iu ([, [, a]]) u 1  uku 1
l = tr(cid:26)1

(60)

note that the eigenvalues are kinematically coupled by an inverse-square type poten-
tial with the angular momentum degrees of freedom. the connection of the matrix
model to the calogero model along the lines presented here and below was rst es-
tablished in [35]. also, the hamiltonian (60) has been proposed independently of the
matrix model as an su(n)-generalization of the classical calogero system [36, 37].

we can now examine special cases:
a) the most gauge invariant sector is, of course, the one in which the angular
momentum charges vanish, that is, j = 0. in that case, (60) for k = 0 becomes the
hamiltonian of non-interacting particles in an external potential v (x). this would
be the case of standard particles.

b) for the next simplest case the angular momentum j should be as trivial
as possible without vanishing. only its eigenvalues are really relevant, since we
can always perform a time-independent unitary transformation v which would shift
u  v u and would rotate j  v jv 1. the simplest choice would be to take the
eigenvalues of j to be equal. unfortunately, this is not possible since the traceless
condition would make them vanish. the simplest possible choice is to take all the
eigenvalues equal to  except one, which would cancel the trace by being (1  n).
this can be written in terms of an arbitrary column n-vector v as

in which case k becomes

j = (vv  1) ,

vv = n

k = (uu  1) ,

u = u 1v

from (58) we see that kii = 0 (no sum on i) and thus

uiu

i = 1 (no sum)

so the coecient of the inverse-square potential in (60) becomes

kijkji = uiu

j uju

i = 2

(i 6= j)

finally, (60) becomes

h = xi

pi +xi<j

(xi  xj)2 +xi

(61)

(62)

(63)

(65)

this is the calogero model! the potential strength g = 2 is related to the conserved
charge . quantum mechanically, picking this charge will amount to a choice of
statistics. we also get, at this stage, an arbitrary external potential v (x).

c) more general choices of j amount to more variety in its eigenvalues. kijkji
now, in general, becomes time-dependent and the dynamics more complicated. we
postpone the discussion for the quantum case where it will be shown that this
corresponds to calogero particles having also internal degrees of freedom. this
will be a generalization of the discussion of the rst section, with irreps of su(n)
substituting the irreps of sn .

now that we have this new approach we can use matrix technology to demon-
strate the integrability of the calogero model [35, 28]. for v (x) = 0 the matrix
motion becomes free and m is conserved. the conjugation-invariant quantities

are also conserved and in involution (the matrix elements of
have vanishing poisson brackets). from (54) and (58) we have

m are momenta and

in = tr m n

(66)

mjk = u 1 jk xj  (1  jk)
= u 1 jk xj  (1  jk)

ikjk

xj  xk! u
xj  xk! u

(67)

(68)

when the above expression is inserted in the trace in = tr m n clearly u drops
and products of the form uiu
i will appear which reduce to powers of
. therefore, the in reduce to expressions involving only xi,
xi and the coupling
constant . these are the conserved integrals of the calogero model.

k . . . u

j uju

starting from the matrix model the actual motion of the calogero model can be

obtained. the solution for m is

m = b + ct

for arbitrary matrices b, c. the conserved charge becomes
m ] = i[b, c] = i(uu  1)

j = i[m,

(69)

(70)

by unitary transformations we can choose the phases of u such that ui = 1; choices
for b, c, then, that satisfy (70) are

bjk = jk qj , cjk = jkpj  (1  jk)

i

qj  qk

(71)

qi and pi are the initial conditions for xi and xi at time t = 0. diagonalizing, then,
m = b + ct for the above b, c produces the motion of the system. another choice
is

bjk = jkaj + (1  jk)

, cjk = jkpj

(72)

i

pj  pk
19

pi and ai are asymptotic momenta and impact parameters. for t   the o-
diagonal elements of b produce a perturbation of order t1 to the eigenvalues, so
the motion is determined by the diagonal elements ai + pit alone. we recover the
result that the motion at asymptotic regions is the same as if the particles were free.
we conclude by mentioning that the matrix model is also integrable and solvable
22x2. the non-hermitian

in the presence of a harmonic oscillator potential v (x) = 1
matrix q = m + im evolves as

q(t) = eitq(0)

(73)

and the matrix qq is conserved. we leave it as an exercise to derive the conserved
integrals and the motion of the corresponding calogero problem.

external potentials with up to quartic dependence on x also lead to integrable,
although not so solvable, models [38]. it is an open question to prove this is all there
is, or to nd yet more integrable potentials. for the purposes of statistics this is a
rather academic issue.

finally, we may wonder what restricts us to one dimension. we chose a model
with one matrix, and its eigenvalues corresponded to coordinates of particles on the
line. we could, indeed, start with an appropriate model with many matrices, which
would reproduce particle motion in higher dimensions [39]. the integrability and
solvability properties of such extended models, however, are much less pleasant. the
question of whether they represent a workable extension of statistics remains open.

4.2 the unitary matrix model

the hermitian matrix model works well for particles on the line but has trouble
representing particles on periodic spaces. the most natural candidate for such
models would be a unitary n n matrix u. its eigenvalues are phases and naturally
live on the circle. we start, therefore, with a lagrangian that represents the invariant
kinetic energy on the space of such matrices:

l = 

1
2

tr(u 1 u )2

(74)

a potential could in principle be included but we are interested in the translationally
invariant case and will omit it. the treatment is similar as before, and we just
summarize the relevant facts.

the lagrangian is, in fact, invariant under separate left- and right-multiplications
of u by time-independent unitary matrices and and there are two corresponding
conserved matrix angular momenta l and r:

l = i u u 1
u  v u :
u  uw 1 : r = iu 1 u

20

(75)
(76)

the unitary conjugation that preserves the eigenvalues corresponds to w = v and
its generator is

j = l + r = i[ u , u 1]

the rest of the discussion is as previously. parametrizing

u = v v 1 with  = diag{eixi, . . . eixn}

the hamiltonian becomes, after a few steps,

h = xi

2 xi6=j

kijkji

4 sin2 xixj

where, as before,

k = v 1jv

(77)

(78)

(79)

(80)

choosing j = k = 0 reproduces free particles on the circle, while choosing j =
(uu  1) we obtain kijkji = 2 and we recover the sutherland inverse-sine-square
model

h = xi

2

x2

2 xi6=j

(81)

this model is integrable and solvable by the same techniques as the hermitian

one. the conserved invariant quantities are

in = trln = tr(r)n = tr(iu 1 u )n

and the solution is

u = beict

with b a unitary and c a hermitian matrix satisfying

bcb1  c = j

for the sutherland case with j = (uu  1), ui = 1, b, c become

bjk = jkeiqj , cjk = jk pj + (1  jk)

i

ei(qj qk)  1

(82)

(83)

(84)

(85)

where, clearly, qi and pi are initial positions and momenta.

we conclude by mentioning that, upon scaling x  x, t  2t, the sutherland

model goes over to the free calogero model. this is the innite volume limit.

21

4.3 quantization and spectrum

we will, now, perform the quantization of this system on a periodic space, using
the unitary matrix model. we begin by dening a canonical momentum matrix
conjugate to the coordinate u

 =

l
 u

= u 1 uu 1

the poisson brackets are

{ujk, lm} = jmlk

(86)

(87)

 is somewhat unpleasant, being neither unitary nor hermitian. we prefer to work
in terms of the hermitian matrices l and r dened previously
l = i u u 1 = iu , r = iu 1 u = iu

(88)

using (87) we derive the following poisson brackets:

{ljk, llm} = i(ljmlk  jmllk)
{ljk, rlm} = 0
{rjk, rlm} = i(rjmlk  jmrlk)

(89)
(90)
(91)

the above is nothing but two copies of the u(n) algebra in disguise. to see this,
expand the matrices l and r in the basis of the fundamental generators of su(n)
t a plus the unit matrix:

n 21

l = lo + 2

r = ro + 2

lat a

rat a

n 21

xa=1
xa=1

with lo, la, ro, ra numbers. then use the su(n) commutation relations

as well as the normalization

[t a, t b] = if abct c

tr(t at b) =

1
2

ab

to show that the expansion coecients satisfy the poisson algebra

{la, lb} = f abclc
{la, rb} = 0
{ra, rb} = f abcrc
while lo, ro are central. note that the u(1) charges

lo = ro =

are essentially the total momentum of the system.

we are now ready to perform quantization. in the u-representation, where states

are functions of u,  becomes the matrix derivative jk = iu , acting as

u tr(ub) = b ,

u tr(u 1b) = u 1bu 1

(100)

where b is a constant matrix, and similarly on expressions containing more us. l
and r, upon proper ordering, are represented as

l = uu , r = u  u

(101)

where in r it is understood that we rst act with the derivative and then right-
multiply the result by u. with this ordering, l and r become the proper u(n)
operators acting as

ltr(ub) = ub , ltr(u 1b) = bu 1
rtr(ub) = bu , rtr(u 1b) = u 1b

it is also useful to express their action on arbitrary functions of u as

tr(il)f (u) = f ((1  i)u)  f (u)
tr(ir)f (u) = f (u(1 + i))  f (u)

(102)

(103)

(104)
(105)

where  is an arbitrary innitesimal hermitian matrix, emphasizing their role as
generators of left- and right-multiplication on u. correspondingly, the operators la
and ra satisfy the su(n) algebra. their action can be obtained by taking  = t a
with  an innitesimal scalar parameter, that is,

ilaf (u) = f ((1  it a)u)  f (u)
iraf (u) = f (u(1 + it a))  f (u)

(106)
(107)

the hamiltonian, being classically the kinetic term on the manifold of unitary ma-
trices u(n), quantum mechanically becomes the laplacian operator on the manifold
[40]. using (92,93) it is expressed as

h =

1
2

trl2 = xa

(la)2 +

1
2

n(lo)2 = xa

(ra)2 +

1

(ro)2 =

trr2

(108)

it is, therefore, the common quadratic casimir of the left- and right-su(n) algebra
plus the square of the u(1) charge, the two parts identiable as the relative and
center-of-mass energy respectively.

quantum mechanical states grouping into irreducible representations of the l
and r su(n) algebras will, thus, be degenerate multiplets of the hamiltonian. the
u(1) (center of mass) part trivially separates: we can boost any state by any desired
total momentum np by multiplying the wavefunction by (det u)p . we will examine
only the su(n) part from now on.

23

a natural basis of states for the hilbert space are the matrix elements of the
unitary irreducible representations (irreps) of su(n). let r denote such an irrep,
r(u) the matrix that represents u in this irrep and r(u) the  matrix element
of this matrix. clearly  and  range from 1 to the dimensionality of r, dr. r(u)
are a complete orthonormal basis of wavefunctions for u, that is

z [du]r(u)r

(u) = rr

(109)

with [du] the volume element on the space of su(n) matrices as implied by the
metric ds2 = tr(u 1du)2, also called the haar measure.
we will, now, show that each r(u) is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian with
eigenvalue equal to the quadratic casimir of r, cr. qualitatively, after the discus-
sion of the last paragraphs, this should be obvious: l and r generate the trans-
formations u  v 1u and u  uw . r(u) transforms in the conjugate irrep r
under l and in the irrep r under r. since h is the common quadratic casimir of l
and r we conclude that all d2
r states r(u) are energy eigenstates with eigenvalue
cr = c r.

(if you are confused about l generating u  v 1u rather than u  v u, think
of the dierence between active and passive transformations, which is relevant when
shifting from classical to quantum: (x  a) shifts the wavefunction by +a. also,
although classical transformations on u compose properly,

(110)
quantum mechanically the operators v that perform the shift u  v u on the
argument of the wavefunction would compose

v1(v2u) = (v1v2)u

v1( v2f (u)) = v1f (v2u) = f (v2v1u) = ( v2 v1)f (u)

(111)

therefore we need to invert the action of v to get the right composition law. see
also the discussion of irreps of sn in the section about permutation group statistics.)
let us prove the fact hr(u) = crr(u) more analytically. since r(u) is a

representation, it obeys the group property

r(uv ) = x

rr(v )

from (106) we have

(1 + i)lar(u) = r((1  it a)u) = r(1  it a)r(u)

= r(u)  ira

r(u)

(112)

(113)
(114)

where ra = r(t a) is the a-th generator of su(n) in the r representation. so

lar(u) = ra

r(u)

24

(115)

and

xa

(la)2r(u) = xa

ra

ra

r(u) = xa

(ra)2

r(u)

(116)

the sum pa(ra)2 appearing above is the quadratic casimir in the irrep r and is

proportional to the identity matrix . so, nally,

hr(u) = crr(u)

(117)

incidentally, the spectrum spanned by cr for all r is nothing but the spectrum of
n free fermions on the circle with the ground state energy and the center-of-mass
energy subtracted, where the lengths ri of the rows of the young tableau of r
correspond to the bosonized fermion momenta

pi = ri  i + 1

(118)

and where the center-of-mass energy has been subtracted. the condition ri 
ri+1 for the rows amounts to the fermionic condition pi > pi+1. the spectrum of
the full matrix model, then, is identical to the free fermion one but with dierent
degeneracies.

we have, therefore, identied all energy eigenstates of the matrix model.

it
remains to implement the quantum analog of the choice of angular momentum j,
identify the corresponding reduced quantum model, and pick the subspace of states
of the full model that belongs to the reduced model.

j obeys itself the su(n) algebra (it is traceless, no u(1) charge). a choice of
value for j amounts to a choice of irrep r for this algebra. states within the same
irrep are related by unitary transformations of u and give the same dynamics; they
will be discarded as gauge copies, and only the choice of irrep will be relevant. since
j = l + r, we see that states transforming under (l, r) in the ( r, r) irreps will
transform in the r  r under j. so, only irreps r that are contained in the direct
product of two mutually conjugate irreps can be obtained for j. this amounts to
irreps r with a number of boxes in their young tableau that is an integer multiple
of n. (to get a feeling of this, consider the case n = 2. then j is an orbital-like
realization of the angular momentum through derivatives of u and clearly cannot
admit spinor representations.)

we must, therefore, project the d2

r states in r(u) to the subspace of states
transforming as r under l+r. call g( r, ; r, |r, ) the clebsch-gordan coecient
that projects these states to the  state of r. then the relevant states for this model
become

r(u) = x,

r(u)g( r, ; r, |r, )

(119)

the index  labeling the states within r, as we argued before, counts the dr gauge
copies and does not imply a true degeneracy of states. the degeneracy of the states
produced by each r is, then, given by the number of times that the irrep r is
contained in the direct product r  r or, equivalently, the number of times that r

25

is contained in r  r. calling this integer d(r, r; r), we obtain for the spectrum
and degeneracies:
(120)

er = cr , dr = d(r, r; r)

in particular, if dr = 0 the corresponding energy level is absent from the spectrum.
concluding, we mention that an approach which also reproduces the spectrum
and states of the sutherland model is two-dimensional yang-mills theory on the
circle [41, 42]. this approach is essentially equivalent to the matrix model above
and we will not be concerned with it.

4.4 reduction to spin-particle systems

so we have derived the spectrum, degeneracy and wavefunctions of the matrix model
restricted to the sector j = r. classically these restrictions represented free particles
(j = 0), sutherland particles (j = (vv  1)) or something more general. what
are the corresponding quantum systems?
to nd these, let us reproduce here the expression of the reduced hamiltonian

in one of these sectors:

h = xi

1
2

p2
i +

1

2 xi6=j

kijkji

4 sin2 xixj

2  eo

(121)

this expression remains valid quantum mechanically upon a proper denition (or-
dering) of the operator k. the only residual quantum eect is a constant term
eo that comes from the change of measure from the matrix space to the space of
eigenvalues.

let us expand a bit on this without entering too deeply into the calculations.
(for details se, e.g., [43].) the haar measure in terms of the diagonal and angular
part of u has the form

where [dv ] is the haar measure of v and  is the vandermonde determinant

[du] = 2 [dv ]

2 sin

xi  xj

2

 = yi<j

(122)

(123)

to see this, write the line element tr(u 1du)2 in terms of v and xi using (78)
and obtain

 tr(u 1du)2 = xi

dx2

i xi,j

4 sin2 xi  xj

2

(v 1dv )ij(v 1dv )ji

(124)

this metric is diagonal in dxi and (v 1dv )ij. the square root of the determinant
of this metric, which gives the measure (volume element) on the space, is clearly 2
times the part coming from v which is the standard haar measure for v . (we get
two powers of 4 sin2 xixj
in the determinant, one from the real and one from the

2

26

imaginary part of (v 1dv )ij, so the square root of the determinant has one power
of 2.)

to bring the kinetic xi-part into a at form (plain second derivatives in xi)
we must multiply the wavefunction with the square root of the relevant measure
(compare with the change from cartesian to radial coordinate in spherical potential
problems). the net result is that the wavefunction  in terms of xi and v is the
original wavefunction (u) of the matrix model times the vandermonde determi-
nant. this, however, also produces an additive constant eo which comes from the
action of the entire xi-kinetic operator on . noticing that  is nothing but the
ground state wavefunction of n free fermions on the circle, we see that eo is the
relevant fermionic ground state energy

eo =

n(n 2  1)

24

(125)

this is the famous fermionization of the eigenvalues produced by the matrix model
measure.

to determine the proper ordering for k we examine its properties as a gener-
ator of transformations. since u = v v 1, and j generates u  v uv 1 =
(v v )(v v )1, we see that j generates left-multiplications of the angular part v
of u. k = v 1jv , on the other hand, generates right-multiplications of v , as can
be see from its form or by explicit calculation through its poisson brackets. as a
result, it also obeys the su(n) algebra. its proper quantum denition, then, is such
that it satises, as an operator, the su(n) algebra. it clearly commutes with the
diagonal part xi and its momentum pi, since it has no action on it. its dynamics are
fully determined by the hamiltonian (121) and its su(n) commutation relations.

we can, therefore, in the context of the particle model (121), forget where k
came from and consider it as an independent set of dynamical su(n) operators. k,
however, obeys some constraints. the rst is that, as is obvious from k = v 1jv ,
k carries the same irrep r as j. the second is subtler: a right-multiplication of
v with a diagonal matrix will clearly leave u = v v 1 invariant. therefore, this
change of v has no counterpart on the physical degrees of freedom of the model
and is a gauge transformation. as a result, we get the gauss law that physical
states should remain invariant under such transformations. since k generates right-
multiplications of v , and kii (no sum) generates the diagonal ones, we nally obtain

(no sum) kii = 0 (on physical states)

(126)

(a more pedestrian but less illuminating way to see it is: j = i[u 1, u ], being a
commutator, vanishes when sandwiched between the same eigenstate of u. since k
is essentially j in the basis where u is diagonal, its diagonal elements vanish.) note
that the constraint (126) is preserved by the hamiltonian (121).

the above fully xes the reduced model hilbert space as the product of the
n-particle hilbert space times the dr-dimensional space of k, with the constraint
(126) also imposed. the further casting of the model into something with a more

27

direct physical interpretation relies upon a convenient realization of k. any such
realization will do: simply break the representation of su(n) that it carries into
irreps r and read o the spectrum for each r from the results of the previous section.
mi,

we shall implement k in a construction `a la jordan-wigner. let ami, a

m = 1, . . . q, i = 1, . . . n be a set of nq independent bosonic oscillators [42]:

then

[ami, a

nj] = mnij

correspondingly, the coecient of the sutherland potential in (121) is (for i 6= j)
(130)

miani a

we already see that the degrees of freedom of k are redistributed into degrees of
freedom for each particle in the above. specically, dening

si,mn = a

q   q
xs=1

siasi! mn

(131)

and comparing with (129) we see that the si are n independent sets of operators
each satisfying the su(q) algebra. before expressing kijkji in terms of the si let
us see what the constraint (126) implies:

kii =

xm=1

mkamk commutes with all kij and all si,mn. it is, therefore, a casimir and can
be chosen as a xed integer n equal to the total number operator of the subspace
of the oscillator fock space in which the model lives. the above constraint, then,
implies

q

a
miami = 

(133)

xm=1

(we see why we had to choose the total number operator to be a multiple of n:
the operator in (133) above is also a number operator and can have only integer
eigenvalues.) using this in (131) we can express

a
miani = si,mn +

(134)

and therefore

kijkji = xmn

si,mnsj,nm +

( + q)

(135)

where ~si  ~si = tr(sisj) is the su(q)-invariant scalar product of the two su(q)
vectors. we nally obtain the hamiltonian as [42]

p2
i +

2~si  ~sj + (+q)

(136)

so it is a sutherland-like model but where the particles also carry su(q) internal
degrees of freedom (spins) and the potential contains a pairwise antiferromagnetic
interaction between the spins.

it remains to specify the representation in which the su(q) spins are and nd
the irreps contained in this realization of k, therefore obtaining the spectrum. a
realization of the form (129) for q = 1 in terms of bosonic oscillators contains all
totally symmetric irreps of s(n) (that is, the ones with a single row in their young
tableau). (129) is essentially the direct product of q such independent realizations,
so it contains all direct products of q totally symmetric irreps. this produces all
irreps with up to q rows in their young tableau, perhaps more than once each.
the constraint (133), however, implies that the total number of boxes in the young
tableau of these irreps is n. we recover once more the constraint that we derived
before based on the origin of r as a component of r  r.
similarly, the realization (131) of si contains all the totally symmetric irreps of
su(q). (133) implies that the number of boxes of these irreps is equal to , so the
spins si are each in the -fold symmetric irrep of su(q). solving this model amounts
to decomposing the tensor product of these n spins into irreducible components of
su(q). each such component corresponds to a subspace of the hilbert space with
a xed total spin s. this same irrep, interpreted as an irrep r of su(n), will be
the corresponding irrep of k, and also of j, and thus will determine the spectrum
of this sector through (120).

let us elucidate the above by reproducing the two simplest cases: free particles

and (spinless) sutherland particles, comparing with the classical treatment.

a) free particles correspond to j = k = 0. so there is no spin and no potential
and we have non-interacting particles. from (120) we see that all dr are one, and
thus the spectrum is the free fermion one, as commented before. the matrix model
naturally quantizes free particles as fermions.

b) spinless sutherland particles correspond, classically, to j = (vv  1). so
j is rank one (ignoring the trace). quantum mechanically this corresponds to the
irrep r of j having only one row and therefore only one independent casimir. since
q in the realization above corresponds to the number of rows, we must have q = 1.
spins, therefore, are absent. the strength of the potential becomes ( + 1) where

29

n is the number of boxes in the one row of r. by standard young tableau rules we
see that the degeneracy dr is one if the row lengths of r satisfy

ri  ri+1 + 

(137)

else it is zero. the spectrum of this model is, then, the same as the spectrum of free
particles but with the selection rule for their momenta

pi  pi+1 +  + 1

(138)

we recover the minimum distance selection rule of the csm model that led to
the interpretation as particles with generalized statistics! only, in this case, the
statistics parameter  + 1 is a positive integer.

we mention here that a jordan-wigner realization of k in terms of fermionic os-
cillators is also useful and leads to particles with spins interacting via ferromagnetic
sutherland-type potentials. the hamiltonian becomes [42]

(139)

h = xi

where now the spins are in the -fold antisymmetric irrep of su(q). we will not
elaborate further and leave the details as an exercise to the reader.

in conclusion, the matrix model has provided us with the following:
1. an augmentation of the permutation group into the su(n) group and a

corresponding possibility to dene statistics through the irreps of su(n).

2. a realization of generalized scalar statistics but with quantized statistics

parameter  + 1 in terms of the csm model.

3. a realization of generalized non-abelian statistics in terms of particles with
internal degrees of freedom interacting through a generalized csm-type potential.

4. a systematic way of solving the above models.

what the matrix models has not provided is

1. a realization of generalized statistics for fractional statistics parameter.
2. a realization of spin-csm systems with the spins in arbitrary (non-symmetric)

representations.

3. a control of the coupling strength of the potential for the spin-csm models.
(note that the coecient of ~si  ~sj terms is xed to 2 and also the constant therm
( + q) is entirely xed by the spin representation.)
there exist generalizations of the above models both at the classical [44, 45]
and the quantum level [46]. they all share, however, the limitations spelled out
above, especially (3). these restrictions are important, in the quest of more general
statistics but also from the more practical point of view of solving spin-chain models
with spins not in the fundamental representation, as we will shortly explain. for
this reason, yet a dierent approach will be pursued in the next section, namely, the
operator approach.

30

5 operator approaches

the matrix model connection provided us with a powerful tool that not only allowed
us to generalize statistics but also led to the full quantum solution of a set of spin-
generalized csm models.

as noted, however, in the conclusion of the preceding lecture, the matrix model
xes the coecient of the spin-interaction and scalar interaction terms to 2 and
(  q) respectively. we cannot choose these coecients at will.
we would like to have an approach that defeats this restriction and leads to spin
models with arbitrary coupling strengths. (this is necessary to attack spin-chain
systems through the innite-coupling limit trick to be explained later.) such an
approach should also be able to bypass the excursion to matrix models and deal
more directly with these systems in an algebraic way. this will be achieved with
the exchange operator formalism [47] (also known as the dunkl operator formalism
[48]).

5.1 exchange operator formalism

consider the operators mij that permute the coordinate degrees of freedom of n
particles in one dimension which could, in principle, also have internal degrees of
freedom (m for metathesis, to avoid confusion with momenta pi). they satisfy the
permutation algebra (symmetric group), in particular

mij = m 1

ij = m 

ij = mji

[mij, mkl] = 0
mijmjk = mikmij

if i, j, k, l distinct

if i, j, k distinct

any operator ai on the phase space satisfying

mijak = akmij
mijai = ajmij

if i, j, k distinct

(140)
(141)
(142)

(143)
(144)

will be called a one-particle operator (even though it may involve the coordinates
and momenta of many particles).

we construct the following one-particle operators [47]:

i = pi +xj6=i

iw (xi  xj)mij  pi +xj6=i

iwijmij

(145)

we shall view the i as generalized momenta. to ensure their hermiticity the pre-
potential w (x) should satisfy

w (x) = w (x)

31

(146)

we shall construct the corresponding free hamiltonian from i

1
2

2
i

h = xi

(147)

in terms of the original pi this hamiltonian will, in general contain linear terms. to
ensure that such terms are absent we must further impose

w (x) = w (x) = real

(148)

with the above restriction the hamiltonian h and commutation relations of the i
become

[i, j] = xk
i +xi<j(cid:16)w 2

wijk = wijwjk + wjkwki + wkiwij
mijk = mijmjk

(149)

(150)

(151)
(152)

to obtain an interesting and tractable model, wijk, which appears in the commuta-
tor [i, j] and also as a three-body potential, should vanish or at most be a constant.
this leads to a functional equation for w (x):

w (x)w (y)  w (x + y) [w (x) + w (y)] = const(= wijk)

(153)

we present the solutions:

a) wijk = 0  w (x) = /x
b) wijk = 2 < 0  w (x) =  cot x
c) wijk = +2 > 0  w (x) =  coth x

we obtain a calogero-like model with exchange interactions. yet it is nothing
but a free model in the commuting momenta i. integrability is immediate: the
permutation-invariant quantities

n
i

in = xi

(157)

obviously commute with each other. if we assume that the particles carry no internal
degrees of freedom and are bosons or fermions then mij = 1 on physical states. the
model becomes the standard calogero model and we have proved its integrability
in one scoop. (you may be left with a question mark: the hamiltonian and the
other integrals in become the standard calogero ones if mij = 1, so these reduced
integrals will commute on the bosonic or fermionic subspace; but will they also
commute on the full hilbert space? prove for yourself that this is indeed the case.)
we can also construct harmonic oscillator operators [47, 49]. the commutators

between xi and i are

[xi, j] = imij

internal degrees of freedom. since

for  > 0 the bosonic state is acceptable, while for  < 0 the fermionic one is
acceptable. in the wrong combinations of statistics and sign of  the ground state
is not annihilated by the ai, but it is still annihilated by all permutation-invariant
combinations of the ai.

from (166) we see that we can nd the spectrum of this model for fermions
or bosons by acting on the ground state with all possible permutation-symmetric
homogeneous polynomials in the a

i . a basis bor these is, e.g.,

(a

i )n

an = xi

(170)

so the spectrum is identical to non-interacting fermions or bosons, but with a dif-
ferent ground state energy. for the right combinations of  and statistics, where
(169) are the correct ground state wavefunctions, the ground state energy is

eo =

finally, the quantities

can be shown to commute [47], and therefore this system is also integrable. it is left
as an exercise to nd the commutation relations of the hi and show that [in, im] = 0.

i = pi + i cot xijmij

[i, j] = 2xk

we obtain the sutherland model with exchange interactions plus an extra term.
on bosonic or fermionic states this becomes an overall constant and we recover the
standard sutherland model. again, since h is by construction positive denite, if a
state satisfying i = 0 exists it will be the ground state. we obtain

b = yi<j | sin xij|
f = yi<j

sgn(xij)| sin xij|

(176)

(177)

which are acceptable for the same combinations of  and statistics as before. for
both cases mijk = 1 so

eo = 2 n(n 2  1)

24

(178)

is the correct sutherland model ground state energy. the excited states can again
be obtained in a (rather complicated) algebraic way [50]. finally, the quantities

mij = pi + eixixj6=i

(179)

can be shown to have the same commutation relations as the hi dened previously

this is the inverse-hyperbolic-sine-square model and supports only scattering states.
its integrability can be obtained as for the sutherland model above, or simply as
an analytic continuation of that model for imaginary period of space. we will not
examine it any further.

in conclusion, an exchange-family of models was introduced, solved and related
to the standard csm models in spaces of denite symmetry. it is remarkable that
all these proofs work directly, and only, at the quantum domain (there is no classical
analog of mij).

35

5.2 systems with internal degrees of freedom

we can easily extend the previous results for particles with internal degrees of free-
dom. for this, assume that the particles are distinguishable or, equivalently, that
they carry a number q of (discrete) internal degrees of freedom (species) that can
be used to (partially) distinguish them. their states are spanned by |x,  >, where
 = 1, . . . q counts internal states. the total permutation operator tij, then is

tij = mijij

(182)

where ij is the operator that permutes the internal states of particles i and j.

let us, then, simply take states that are bosonic or fermionic under total particle

exchange: tij = 1. on such states

and the calogero and sutherland exchange model hamiltonians become [51]

(186)

(187)

where sa

interaction coecient of the potential in the hamiltonian takes the form [52, 53, 51,
54]

  2~si  ~sj   +

q!

(188)

we have recovered the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin model of the pre-
vious section but with arbitrary coecient! on the other hand, the spins are nec-
essarily in the fundamental of su(q). so we have obtained a generalization of the
coupling constant with respect to the matrix model but a restriction of the allowed
spins.

36

note that  here is an arbitrary parameter, while  in (136) was the size of the
symmetric representation of si. for  = 1 and spins in the fundamental, the matrix
model and exchange-operator model agree. it is interesting to note that we can go
from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic interactions either by changing the sign of
 or by changing the statistics of the particles.

the solution of the above models can be obtained algebraically. for the spin-
sutherland model this is rather complicated and is related to the so-called yangian
symmetry [55, 56, 57, 58]. for the spin-calogero model it is easier [59]. let us
concentrate on the model with interaction (2~si ~sj 1
q ) and dene the operators

and their hermitian conjugates. these form a complete set for all permutation-
symmetric creation and annihilation operators for all species of particles. yet the
commutators among themselves and with h do not involve . they create, therefore,
the same spectrum of excitations over the ground state as n noninteracting bosons
or fermions with q species. for  > 0 the ground state is the bosonic one:

b = yi<j |xij|e 1

2 pi

x2

i s({i})

(190)

where s is a totally symmetric state in the i. the set of all s forms the n-

fold symmetric irrep of the total spin s = pi si. therefore the ground state is
(n + q  1)!/n!(q  1)! times degenerate. for  < 0 the above is not normalizable
any more. but we remember that we can obtain the same model by starting from
fermions and the opposite coupling  > 0. the ground state, then, is of a fermionic
type

f = xp

(191)

where p are total particle permutations and i are a set of xed values for the
indices i that determine the state. clearly the ground state will be obtained for
the minimal total power of xi appearing above, and that will happen for a maximally
dierent set of values i. these states form the n-fold antisymmetric irrep of the
total spin s, where n = n(modq). the ground state is, thus, q!/n!(q  n)! times
degenerate. the above spectra will come handy later.

5.3 asymptotic bethe ansatz approach

we already mentioned that there are elaborate algebraic approaches to derive the
spectrum of the spin-sutherland model, based on the yangian symmetry. we will,
instead, take a lower-key approach which reproduces the same spectra and is phys-
ically more lucid, although not as rigorous. we will take the aba route.

consider distinguishable particles of the exchange-calogero type without external
potential, coming in with asymptotic momenta ki and scattering o each other.

37

before scattering, their positions are in some denite ordering determined by the
ordering of their momenta (it is the inverse of that ordering).

the key observation is that, after scattering, the particles have simply gone
through each other with no backscattering [60]. the impenetrable 1/x2 potential
has become completely penetrable in the presence of the exchange term! you can
prove this fact by examining the asymptotic properties of a simultaneous eigenstate
of 1, . . . n which is obviously an energy eigenstate: at xi   the prepotential
terms are vanishing and we simply have eigenstates of the individual pi. since
there are no pieces with the values of pi permuted (coming from backscattering)
we have complete transmission.
(to explicitly see how it works, it is instructive
to consider the two-body problem, decompose it into symmetric and antisymmetric
parts, scatter and recombine the parts after scattering. a relative phase of  between
the two parts is what produces the eect.)

(puzzle: what happens with the correspondence principle? with h back in, the
interaction coecient is (  hmij). how can a term of order h produce such a
dramatic eect, particles going through each other, in the h  0 limit?)
so the only eect of the scattering is a phase shift of the wavefunction which, as
we have said, is the sum of two-body phases

sc =

n(n  1)

2



(192)

this is true on an innite space. on a periodic space we can still use the above
result, together with the requirement for periodicity for the wavefunction, to derive
the spectrum. this is the aba method and is expected to reproduce the correct
results in the thermodynamic limit of many particles at constant density [60]. it
gives, in fact, the exact answer for the sutherland model [26], so we can expect it to
work also in the present case. for a space of period 2 the result is

2ki +x

sgn(ki  kj) = 2ni

(193)

the left hand side counts the total phase picked up by a particle going round the
space and scattering o to the other particles in the way. ni are arbitrary integers,
ensuring periodicity. there are, however, some constraints on the choice of of ni
that are imposed by continuity from the  = 0 case:
if ki  kj then ni  nj
if ni = nj there is a unique solution, that is, ki < kj and ki > kj represent the
same state.
these rules are important to avoid overcounting and to discard spurious solutions.
with these, the spectrum obtained is the same as the one derived with more rigorous
methods. for the ordering n1  . . . nn the solution for ki is

ki = ni + (i 

n + 1

2

)

38

(194)

and similarly for other orderings. we see that the aba momenta ki are the same
as the quasimomenta that we have previously dened.

the bottom line is that the spectrum and degeneracies are the same as those
of distinguishable particles obeying generalized selection rules for their momentum.
still, what xes the degeneracy of states is the dierent ways that we can distribute
the particles to the quantum numbers ni, rather than ki (see, especially, the second
rule above). a state of n particles with the same ni, for instance, is nondegener-
ate although they, seemingly, have dierent ki which would imply a permutation
degeneracy.

for particles with spin the construction above, in combination with the trick of
the previous subsection of starting with fermions or bosons, produces a spectrum
with degeneracies the same as those of free particles (the ni are free quantum
numbers). as argued before, for ferromagnetic interactions we must choose bosons
and combine their spins accordingly, while for antiferromagnetic interactions we
must choose fermions. to spell it out, this means the following:
1. choose a set of quantum numbers ni. the ordering is immaterial, since we have
identical particles, so you can choose n1  . . . nn .
2. place your particles on these quantum numbers and put their spins in the ap-
propriate state. for the ferromagnetic case treat them as bosons: the total spin
of particles with the same ni transforms in the symmetric tensor product of their
spins. for the antiferromagnetic case treat them as fermions: the total spin of of
particles with the same ni transforms in the antisymmetric tensor product of their
spins; clearly up to q can have the same ni in this case.

3. calculate the energy of this state in terms of the aba momenta (194): e = pi k2

i .
it should be obvious that similar rules applied to the spin-calogero system reproduce
the spectrum derived in the last subsection. this method can be used to calculate
both the statistical mechanics (large n) of these systems and the few-body spectra.

5.4 the freezing trick and spin models

now that we have a tractable way of solving spin-csm systems with arbitrary
strength of interaction we can introduce the freezing trick [65] and deal with spin
chain models.

consider, rst, the previous ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic spin-sutherland
model. take the limit   . the potential between the particles goes to innity,
so for any nite-energy state the particles will be nearly frozen to their classical
equilibrium positions. in fact, even the excitation energies around that conguration
will go to innity: the ground state energy scales like 2, while the excitations scale
like nn + n2 with n some excitation parameter. so, to leading order in  the
spectrum becomes linear and of order . these excitations correspond, essentially, to
phonon modes of small oscillations around the equilibrium positions of particles. the
stiness of oscillations is, of course, proportional to the strength of the potential
2 and the spectrum is proportional to the frequency, of order .

39

the quantum uctuations of the particle positions in any state will scale like
the inverse square root of the oscillator frequency, that is, like 1/. but, in the
hamiltonian, the piece coupling the spins to the kinematical degrees of freedom is
proportional to 1/ sin2 xij. in the large- limit, thus, this term becomes a constant
equal to its classical equilibrium value; so, in that limit, spin and kinematical degrees
of freedom decouple. (note that the spin part is also of order .) the hamiltonian
becomes

with hs the spinless sutherland hamiltonian and hspin the spin part

h = hs + hspin

hspin = xi<j

2~si  ~sj
4 sin2 xij
2

(195)

(196)

where the classical equilibrium positions xj are equidistant points on the circle:

xj =

2j
n

(197)

the hamiltonian (196) above describes a spin chain consisting of a regular peri-
odic lattice of spins in the fundamental of su(q) coupled through mutual ferro- or
antiferromagnetic interactions of strength inversely proportional to their chord dis-
tance. it is the well known su(q) haldane-shastry (hs) model [61, 62]. according
to the above, its spectrum can be found by taking the full spectrum of the corre-
sponding spin-sutherland model in the large- limit, modding out the spectrum of
the spinless model and rescaling by a factor 1/. each state will inherit the spin
representation of its parent spin-sutherland state. so, both the energy and the
total spin of the states of the hs model can be determined this way. commuting
integrals of this model [63] can also be obtained this way [64]. at the level of the
partition function at some temperature t we have

zspin(t ) = lim


z(t )
zs(t )

(198)

from this, the thermodynamics of the spin chain model can be extracted [60].

we will not give the details of this construction here. we urge anyone interested
to solve this way a few-site (two or three) spin chain, see how it works and deduce
the construction rules for the spectrum of a general spin chain. let us simply
state that the many degeneracies of the spectrum of the hs model (larger that the
total spin su(q) symmetry would imply), which is algebraically explained by the
existence of the yangian symmetry, can, in this approach, be explained in terms of
the degeneracies of free particles. (the degeneracies are not identical, due to the
modding procedure, but related.)

for the spin-calogero model a similar limit can be taken, scaling also the external
oscillator frequency as    to keep the system bound. the classical equilibrium

40

positions of this model are at the roots of the n-th hermite polynomial. we ob-
tain, therefore, a non-regular lattice of spins interacting with a strength inversely
proportional to the square of their distance [65]. the spectrum of this model can
be found quite easily with the above method. again, we refer to the literature for
details [59, 66].

in the continuum limit (n  ) the antiferromagnetic version of both the above
models become c = 1 conformal eld theories, the hs containing both chiral sectors
while the inhomogeneous harmonic one containing just one sector.

other models exist and can be solved in this spirit: hierarchical (many-coupling)
models [67], supersymmetric models [68], twisted models [69] etc. all, however,
work only for the fundamental representation of some internal group. the big,
important open problem is to crack a particle system with a higher representation
for the spins and arbitrary coupling strength. if this is done, through the freezing
trick we will be able to solve a spin chain with spins in a higher representation. this
is interesting since we could then see if the antiferromagnetic system for integer
su(2) spins develops a mass gap, according to the haldane conjecture [70].

6 exclusion statistics

so far we approached the problem of statistics in a fundamental way, trying to give
a reasonable denition and presenting systems that realized this denition. in this
last section we shall give a phenomenological approach, based on the state-counting
properties of a system whose dynamics may remain, otherwise, undetermined. it
is based on a notion already familiar from the csm model, the notion of state
repulsion or exclusion. this will lead to haldanes exclusion statistics.

6.1 motivation from the csm model

although haldane derived his denition from the properties of the hs spin chain,
we will use the csm model instead. consider the principal quantum number of
this model, that is, the one in terms of which the energy eigenvalues are a sum of
independent terms: quasiexcitation numbers ni for the calogero and quasimomenta
pi for the sutherland model. they obey an enhanced exclusion principle where
nearby values can be no closer that  units. it seems as if each of them occupies
 places in the single-particle hilbert space, instead of one. so, let us dene the
dimensionality d(n) of the hilbert space of states available to an additional particle
given that there are already n particles in the system. (some high-energy cuto
is needed, of course, to make this nite.) the exclusion statistics parameter g is,
then dened as [71]

g = 

d
n

(199)

if this parameter is independent of n, or becomes a constant for high enough n,
then we say that the system obeys exclusion statistics of order g. clearly g = 0, 1

41

corresponds to bosons and fermions, respectively. from the discussion of the csm
model we would conclude that it obeys exclusion statistics with g = .

note that, in principle, this denition applies to systems of arbitrary dimension-
ality. the fact that only one-dimensional exclusion statistics systems have been as
yet identied presumably points to something essentially one-dimensional in this
denition. note also that g can be fractional: d(n) could be either ill-dened (as,
in fact, in the csm model) so that it can assume approximate fractional values,
or it could depend on n in a way that g becomes constant only for large enough
n, like, e.g., d(n) = [n/2] with [ ] the integer part, giving g = 1/2.

6.2 semiclassics  heuristics

before examining the consequences of (199) let us make some heuristic semiclassical
arguments about phase space volume and exclusion to give more substance to it.
please view the following discussion simply as additional motivation -do not take it
seriously!

semiclassically, the number of states of a system is given by the volume of its
phase space in units of h for each pair of canonical variables. let us consider for
simplicity the minimal space (q, p). it could correspond, for instance, to the relative
coordinate and momentum of two particles on the line. the standard lagrangian
would look like

l = p q  h(p, q)

(200)

if we want the presence of the one particle to knock out g states out of the
hilbert space, we should include some term in the classical action that, eectively,
reduces the volume (in this case, area) of phase space by gh. this area is given as

a = zd

dpdq = id

pdq

(201)

where v is a domain in phase space and d its boundary. if the domain does not
include the point q = p = 0 the area should be the standard one, since we are talking
about a region of phase space where the particles are apart. if, on the other hand,
q = p = 0 is included, the particles are together and the area should diminish by
gh = 2g (taking h = 1).

this reminds us of the aharonov-bohm eect. there must be a dirac string
piercing the point (0, 0) in phase space giving this extra contribution when circled.
so we must add to the action a term

g = gz pdq  qdp

p2 + 2q2 = gz d atan

q

p !

(202)

where  is any positive constant. this amounts to adding to the lagrangian the
extra term

(203)

lg = g

p q  q q
p2 + 2q2

42

this extra contribution is a total time derivative (a topological term) so it will not
change the equations of motion.
it is expected, though, that it will change the
quantum mechanical states as described above.

let us consider the above in the specic example of two particles in an external
harmonic oscillator potential. after separating the center of mass phase space, the
lagrangian for the relative part becomes

lg = p q  g

p q  q q
p2 + 2q2 

1
2

2(p2 + q2)

(204)

for later convenience we chose  =  in the g-term. the eect of this term is to
shift the poisson brackets between p and q. we will follow the simple approach to
canonical quantization of dening new polar variables ,  as

p + iq = ei

in terms of these the lagrangian becomes

l = (

1
2

2  g)  

1
2

2

so the canonical momentum of  is

and the hamiltonian becomes

 =

1
2

2  g

h = ( + g)

(205)

(206)

(207)

(208)

quantum mechanically the operator  is not quite well dened. in the absence of g,
it would correspond to the phase of the annihilation operator which cannot be a
well-dened hermitian operator: ei should be unitary, yet it decreases the eigenvalue
of 2 = aa by one unit, which is impossible for the ground state. nevertheless, we
will proceed qualitatively and see what we get in this case.

 being a phase, its momentum  should be quantized to integer values. since
the particles are identical, the change of relative coordinates p  p, q  q should
also be a symmetry. this corresponds to    + . choosing the wavefunction to
transform as  itself under this shift, which amounts to quantizing the particles as
bosons or fermions, further restricts the values of  to even or odd integers. finally,
since 2 is a positive denite operator, we have

1
2

2 =  + g  0

(209)

(clearly the problems with the denition of  are hidden in the above constraint).

choosing the even eigenvalues for  (bosonic case), and for g not greater that

2, the spectrum of the relative hamiltonian becomes

e = (2n + g)

(210)

43

for n a nonnegative integer. this is the excitation spectrum of the calogero model!
to see this, add the center of mass oscillator energy ecm = m for m a nonnegative
integer and dene

then the full spectrum becomes

n1 = n , n2 = m + n + g

e = (n1 + n2) with n1  n2  g

(211)

(212)

that is, the excitations of the calogero model in terms of the quasiexcitation numbers
n1,2 satisfying the least distance  constraint for  = g.

this will serve as enough motivation that the idea of phase space exclusion should
be related to eigenvalue repulsion `a la csm model. the questions about the ground
state energy, g > 2 etc. that are left hanging are simply set aside -this model is not
treated seriously here. if anyone is interested, of course, they are welcome to polish
it!

6.3 exclusion statistical mechanics

we will implement exclusion statistics in terms of the possible quantum numbers
of n particles placed in k single-particle states. arranging the k states in a lin-
ear fashion and implementing the least distance g constraint for the particles, for
integer g we get [71, 72]

d(k, n) =

[k  (g  1)(n  1)]!
n![k  g(n  1)  1]!

(213)

possible combinations for allowed values for the particle quantum numbers (to prove
it is a simple combinatorial matter). extrapolated to arbitrary (fractional) g, this
denes the state multiplicity of n particles placed in k states. clearly g = 0, 1
reproduces the bose and fermi result.

this can be used to derive the statistical mechanical properties of a grand en-
semble of such particles. considering all k states to be at nearby energy  and
maximizing the gibbs factor

d(k, n)e()n = maximum

(214)

in terms of n for xed temperature t = 1/k and chemical potential  we obtain
for the distribution n = n/k for large n, k [30, 72, 73]

n =

w

1 + (g  1)w

,

w

(1  w)g = e()

(215)

the expression for n cannot be found analytically except for a few values of g.

it is obvious from the above that fractional statistics particles are not indepen-
dent, in the sense that one cannot derive their statistical mechanics by considering

44

each single-particle state as an independent system to be lled by particles. (op-
erator constructions that incorporate some of the features of exclusion statistics do
exist [74] but they further require specic interactions, else they produce gentile
statistics.) there is no microscopic formulation: we need to start from k states and
take the limit of large k. further, it is not clear how we could implement exclusion
statistics for an interacting system, where we cannot use single-particle states as a
convenient basis. in the following we will sketch how the above diculties can be
overcome [75].

the starting point will be the grand partition function for particles in k states

of like energy



z(k, z) =

d(k, n)zn

(216)

xn =0

where z = exp (  ) is the fugacity. z(k, z) should be extensive, which means
that, for large k it should become the k-th power of a function of z

lim
k

1
k

ln z(k, x) = lim
k

1
k



ln

xn =0

d(k, n)zn = lnxn

pnzn

(217)

in the above we introduced the quantities pn which play a role analogous to the
allowed states of occupation of a single level in the cases of fermions and bosons:
pn = 1 for bosons, while p0,1 = 1, pn>1 = 0 for fermions. we can call them a priori
probabilities of occupation [75] or fractional dimensionality of states [76] according
to taste.

that pn exist should be guaranteed from the proper extensive behavior of the
exclusion statistical mechanics. the problem is to calculate them. for this, we make
a technical trick: to derive the multiplicity of states d(k, n) above we placed the k
states on a line. lets place them on a circle instead, and implement the minimum
distance g rule there. that shouldnt inuence the statistical behavior at large k.
this modies the combinatorics into

d(k, n) =

k[k  (g  1)n  1]!

n!(k  gn)!

(218)

we can check that d(k, n) leads to the same statistical distribution n (215) as
d(k, n). we now notice that z(k, z) dened in terms of d(k, n) becomes an
exact k-th power for all k. we can, then, calculate pn from d(1, n). the result is

pn =

n

ym=2(cid:16)1 

gn

m(cid:17)

(219)

unless g = 0, 1, pn are fractional and always become negative for some values of n
[77]. so their interpretation as probabilities or space dimensions must be taken with
a grain of salt. they are, at any rate, useful tools for describing these systems.

the single-level grand partition function z(z) can be shown to satisfy

z g  z g1 = x

45

(220)

from which the corresponding relation (215) for n = zz ln z follows.

remember that the csm system enjoyed a particle-hole coupling-inverting du-
ality. since exclusion statistics are directly extracted from the properties of these
systems, we anticipate a similar duality here [77, 47]. indeed, we can show that the
grand partition function satises

1

z(g, xg)

+

1

z(g1, x)

= 1

(221)

note that, interestingly, a similar relation holds for gentile statistics of maximum
occupancy p. the grand partition function obviously is

z(p, z) = 1 + z + z2 . . . + zp =

(222)

zp+1  1
z  1

identifying the maximum occupancy p of gentile statistics states with the parameter
1/g, the above expression satises (221) although z(p, z) is not a priori dened for
fractional p.

from the distribution function n(g, z) (215) we can derive in the standard way

the low-temperature sommerfeld expansion for the energy

e(t ) = z d()n(g, ) = e(0) +



xn=0

cn(g)t n+1en

(223)

where () is the density of states and  is xed through

n = z d()n(g, )

(224)

en are t - and g-independent energy integrals. the coecients cn essentially de-
termine the low-temperature heat capacity of the system. the are calculated as

where (x) is the riemann zeta function. in general, cn is a polynomial of degree
n  1 in g.

46

(228)

(229)

which is remarkably similar to pn (except for the range of m). similar results
were obtained in [79] for the case of anyons in a strong magnetic eld. this is not
surprising: the lowest landau level becomes, essentially, a two-dimensional phase
space, so this is yet another realization of fractional statistics in an eectively one-
dimensional space.

note that the connection between pn and wn is the same as the one between
disconnected and connected diagrams in eld theory. this, in view also of the
discussion of the rst section, will lead us to a path-integral representation for the
partition function of exclusion statistics particles in an arbitrary external potential.

6.4 exclusion statistics path integral

we start from the usual euclidean path integral with periodic time  for n particles
with action the sum of n one-particle actions; we further sum over all particle
numbers n with chemical potential weights en /n! to obtain the grand partition
function. since the particles are identical we include a symmetry factor of 1/n!, but
we must also sum over paths where particles have exchanged nal positions. thus
the path integral for each n decomposes into sectors labeled by the elements of the
permutation group p erm(n). (see the discussion in section 1.) such permuted
sectors will be summed with appropriate extra weighting factors, to be determined
in the sequel.

by the usual argument, the gibbs grand potential (the logarithm of the grand
partition function) will be given by the sum of all connected path integrals. it is
obvious that these are the ones where the nal positions of the particles are a cyclic
permutation of the original ones, since these are the only elements of sn that cannot
be written as a product of commuting elements. clearly all diagrams corresponding
to dierent cyclic permutations are equal. there are (n  1)! such permutations.
so, overall, this diagram will carry a factor of ((n  1)!/n! = 1/n. this is nothing
but the symmetry factor, familiar from feynman diagrams, corresponding to cyclic
relabelings of particle coordinates (compare, already, with the factors 1/n included
in (228)).

cyclic permutation diagrams being connected, they only contain one thread of
particle worldline. they really correspond to one particle wrapping n times around
euclidean time and thus will reproduce the single-particle partition function with
temperature parameter n. so, in the grand partition function they will contribute
the terms proportional to en en = zn (the rst factor is the single-particle
boltzmann factor for temperature parameter n and the second is the chemical
potential factor).

but these are the terms appearing in (228) for each energy level! the extra
weighting factors that must be included for these diagrams in order to reproduce
exclusion statistics are, then, identied to the cluster coecients wn . for g = 0, 1
we have wn = 1 and wn = ()n 1, respectively, which is, indeed, the correct factor
implied by r(p ) as discussed in section 1, where r is the trivial (bosons) or the

47

antisymmetric (fermions) irrep of sn and p a cyclic permutation.

in conclusion, if we weight these congurations with the extra factors wn we will
reproduce the grand potential of a distribution of g-ons on the energy levels of the
one-body problem, that is [75]

(, ) =



xn =1

en wn

n z epn

n=1 se [xn(tn)]

dxn(tn)

(230)

n

yn=1

where se is the one-particle euclidean action and the paths obey the boundary
conditions

xn() = xn+1(0) ,

xn () = x0(0)

(231)

(x can be in arbitrary dimensions.)

by exponentiating, the full n-body partition function will be the path integral
over all disconnected components, with appropriate symmetry factors and a factor
of wn for each connected n-particle component. more directly, we can omit the
symmetry factors, sum explicitly over all equivalent permutations in each sector
and divide by n!:

z(, ) =



xn =1

en

n! xp

wp z epn

n=1 se [xn(tn)]

n

yn=1

dxn(tn)

(232)

where the paths obey the boundary condition

{x1(), . . . xn ()} = p{x1(0), . . . xn (0)}

(233)

the weighting factor wp for each permutation depends only on the conjugacy class
of the permutation and is calculated through wn as

wp = wn1    wnk

(234)

where n1, . . . nk are the cycles of p .

it is clear that the above path integral is not unitary, since the weights wn are
not phases and they do not provide true representations of the permutation group
(unlike the g = 0, 1 cases). this does not matter:
it is simply used as a tool to
derive the statistical mechanics of exclusion statistics. we are not going to calculate
and propagators or other processes with it.

once we have the path integral (232) we can easily extend the notion of exclusion

statistics to interacting particles: we simply replace the action pn se[xn] by the full

interacting n-particle action, thus circumventing all diculties with combinatorial
formulae.
in the interacting case one has to work with the full grand partition
function, rather than the grand potential, since topologically disconnected diagrams
are still dynamically connected through the interactions and do not factorize.

in conclusion, we have a path-integral way of dening exclusion statistics for
interacting systems through appropriate symmetry factors included in each permu-
tation sector (analogous to s(p ) of section 1), calculated via (228). there is, yet,
no application of this procedure to an interesting interacting situation.

48

6.5

is this the only exclusion statistics?

after giving so much motivation for it, the question seems almost oensive! but let
us examine it for the sake of ensuring that we have the full picture.

exclusion statistics in terms of repulsion rules for the quantum numbers is,
certainly, as we dened it. but we started from (199) which denes statistics in terms
of the hilbert space dimension of an additional particle in the system. consider,
then, a chunk of k levels in the csm model (k quasimomentum values in the
sutherland model or k quasiexcitation levels for the harmonic calogero model).
place n particles there, and see what space is left for an additional particle.

if the n particles are packed densely (like, e.g., in the fermi sea-like ground
state) they certainly take up a piece of approximately n spaces. so the levels left
for an extra particle are d = k  n and we get g = d/n =  as expected.
what if, however, the n particles are sparse in k; that is, if the distances
between them are all bigger than, say, 2? then each particle makes unavailable 
states either way around it, so, overall, the available space for the extra particle has
diminished by (2  1)n. in this situation we would get g = 2  1. clearly this
denition implies dierent statistics for dierent situations (dense or dilute).
can we dene another statistics that matches closer the hilbert space denition?
clearly any choice of combinatorial formula for d(k, n) that has the right extensive
properties is an alternative denition of some statistics. alternatively, each choice
of pn or wn amounts to some statistics. lets make the simplest choice:

(235)
which, in the path integral, corresponds to one factor of  for each unavoidable
particle crossing. this leads to the statistical distribution n

wn = ()n1

which was analyzed in [80] as the simplest imaginable generalization of the fermi and
bose distribution. the combinatorial formula for d(k, n) for the above -statistics
is

k(k  )(k  2)    (k  (n  1))

=

(237)

n!

d = n

( k
 )!
n!( k
  n)!

this can be thought as a realization of the exclusion statistics hilbert space idea:
the rst particle put in the system has k states to choose, the next has k 
 due to the presence of the previous one an so on, and dividing by n! avoids
overcounting. fermions and bosons correspond to  = 1 and  = 1 respectively.
 = 0 corresponds to boltzmann classical statistics. this should also be clear from
the path integral: no congurations where particles have exchanged positions are
allowed, since their weighting factor is zero, but factors of 1/n! are still included.
the corresponding single-level pn are

pn =

ym=1

for  = 1/p with p integer (a fraction of a fermion), the above probabilities are all
positive for n up to p and vanish beyond that. for  < 0 all probabilities are positive
and nonzero. thus, the above system has a bosonic ( < 0) and a fermionic ( > 0)
sector, with boltzmann statistics as the separator.
it is a plausible alternative
denition of exclusion statistics, and has many appealing features, not shared by
the standard exclusion statistics, such as positive probabilities, a maximum single-
level occupancy in accordance with the fraction of a fermion that  represents, and
analytic expressions for all thermodynamic quantities.

this should demonstrate that the route to alternative denitions, with nice fea-
tures too, is open. the real issue is whether a dynamical system realizes these other
statistics, and, at this point, this is not clear.

7 epilogue

the topic of statistics will not cease fascinating at least a few physicists working
in various elds. it challenges our understanding of the fundamentals of quantum
mechanics and matter, expands the mathematical tools of the trade, promises new
results in specic systems and is fun to think about.

it is anyones guess whether considerations coming purely out of statistics will
produce a (major or minor) breakthrough in any physics problem. a safer predic-
tion, however, is that the idea of generalized statistics will re-emerge in dierent
contexts as we strive to understand new physical systems and develop useful frames
of mind. after all, statistics has barely been touched for objects such as strings
and membranes, which are increasingly the entities of theoretical choice for the
fundamental constituents of the universe. the future promises to be fun!
