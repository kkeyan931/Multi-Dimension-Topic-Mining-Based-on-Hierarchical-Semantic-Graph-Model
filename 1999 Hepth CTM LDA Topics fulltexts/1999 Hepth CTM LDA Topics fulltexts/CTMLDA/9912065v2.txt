abstract

in this paper we investigate the form of calibrated m5-branes in the
presence of a nonvanishing 3-form eld h. we discuss the inuence of
the h-eld on the deformation of supersymmetric n-cycles (in particu-
lar slag submanifolds in rn). in addition we argue for a construction
which relates calibrated m5-branes of dierent curved dimensions to
each other.

1 introduction

slag 3-cycle

supersymmetric bps brane solutions play a very important role in the descrip-
tion of string theory and gauge theories. especially it became clear, that one
can study gauge theories via various supersymmetric brane congurations em-
bedded in at spacetime. this approach is particularly attractive since a lot
of informations about the nonperturbative gauge dynamics can be obtained
by lifting the brane congurations to 11d m-theory [1], where branes preserv-
ing a certain amount of the 32 supercharges of m-theory are described by
calibrated surfaces [2, 3, 4]. for example, gauge theories with eight unbro-
ken supercharges (n = 2 supersymmetry in four dimensions) correspond to
su (2) special lagrangian (slag) calibrations [1]. similarly, gauge theories
with four unbroken supercharges can be associated to su (3)-slag calibra-
tions, the case which was discussed in [5]. however, unlike the supersymmetric
2-cycles, the supersymmetric 3-cycles and all higher odd dimensional slag
cycles are very dicult to construct explicitly. concrete applications requires
a simple handling of such m5-brane solutions. unfortunately for the su (3)-
slag only extremely special solutions could be written down so far. therefore
one is looking for constructions which connect geometries of dierent dimen-
in this context a very exciting construction exists [6],
sions to each other.
which connects lagrangian submanifolds of
dierent dimensions. the construction given
there generates a smoothly varying phase 
on the projected cycles which prevents it to
be slag ( = const) again (see fig.1). we
will show that supersymmetric solutions of
the latter type exist where the non constant
phase can be related to the 3 form eld h
which appears in the general equations of
motions of the m5-brane3 . in order to un-
derstand this projection principle we will
analyze the complete bps equations of the
m5-brane, which includes additional terms
with the capability to modify the dieren-
tial equations of the slag conditions. such terms appear naturally after turn-
ing on the 3 form eld h and after breaking further supersymmetries.
as a byproduct one can use these equations to discuss supersymmetric m5-brane
solutions in a background including a constant 3 form eld c of 11d sugra.
this discussion is also motivated by the recent study of yang-mills theory in a
noncommutative geometry [8]. in this way one might obtain nonperturbative
informations about noncommutative yang-mills theories via h-deformed sw-
curves.
for concreteness, we will focus on the cases of supersymmetric 2-cycles and
show how the slag conditions are aected by the h-elds. the arguments are

generic and can be generalized to all su (n)-slag cases as well.
the paper is organized as follows. in the next section we analyze the bps equa-
tions of [4, 9] showing that slag submanifolds become lag in the presence of
the eld h.

2 the modied geometries

2.1 the bps equations

in static gauge the embedding of the m5-brane into at 11d spacetime is realized
by a map f , which describes the dependence of the transverse coordinates xn,
n = 1, . . . , 5 on the brane coordinates qm, m = 0, . . . , 5. furthermore there
lives a two-form eld bmn on the six-dimensional worldvolume of the m5-brane
with eld strength h = db. a nonlinear self duality constraint is realized on
the eld h, so that the anti self dual part can be computed from the self dual
one:

habc =

( habc + 2 (kh)abc ) .

1
q

a and q are dened by kb
kb
3 trk2. the equations of
motion of the m5-brane are obtained from the superembedding approach [10].
as it is shown there, in the transformation law of the residual spacetime super-
symmetry a projector  appears,

a = hacdhbcd and q = 1  2

 = (1  ) .

from this formula one can nd supersymmetry preserving solutions by requiring
  0. since the m5-brane breaks the so(1, 10) lorentz invariance to a
residual so(1, 5) so(5) subgroup, the formulas are written in a well adapted
form. in particular the 11d gamma matrices a are constructed out of spin(1, 5)
and spin(5) gamma matrices by a general property of cliord algebras. for
the case at hand we obtain:

=

c(r1,5  r5)

 c(r1,5)  c(r5)

j(v  w) = v  1l + 7  w.

(2.1)

7 is the chirality operator of the algebra c(r1,5). then the explicit coordinate
expression of the last formula for a at 11d sugra background as derived in
[9] reads:

(a)(c )i

here i are the chiral spin(1, 5) tangent space gamma matrices on the m5-brane
and  i the spin(5) gamma matrices of the transverse space. without further
specialisations the only solution is given by a at m5-brane preserving one half
of spacetime supersymmetry. on the other hand if there are some nontrivial
identities of products of gamma matrices applied to the spinor  one obtains
dierential equations which determine more general supersymmetric m5-brane
solution. the amount of supersymmetry preserved by such a solution is deter-
mined by the number of relations imposed on the 11d gamma algebra.

2.2 the su(n)-slag calibrations

in the following we concentrate on those projectors which determine the special
lagrangian geometries. they corresponds to the pattern of branes below (the
bar denotes a negative sign of the eigenvalues of supersymmetries preserved by
the brane),

table 2. su (3)-slag

which induce projectors of the type ij =   ij. in the absence of the self
dual 3 form habc these projectors imply the slag dierential equations. the
topology of the solution for su (n)-slag is r1,5n  mn with mn the slag
submanifold. the rst three terms of eq. (2.2) were analyzed in [4]. for these
types of geometries the authors found the bps equations which for su (2)-slag
and su (3)-slag read

the term in front of a c enforces the m5-brane to be a lagrangian submani-
fold. that is a submanifold of half of the dimension of the embedding space on
which the symplectic forms restricts to zero. the symplectic form is dened by
(xr, yr) = g(j xr, yr) with j the complex structure and g the euclidean
scalar product of the embedding space. using the complex structure one can
make a real vector xr into a complex one xc. since

< xc, yc >c = g(xr, yr) + i  r(xr, yr)

orthogonality in the real sense implies orthogonality in the complex sense and
vice versa. then for a manifold to be lagrangian the complexied tangent

vectors must be complex orthonormalized. locally the evaluation of the form

 = (e1 + ie2)  . . .  (e2n1 + ie2n)

on the tangent planes (ei a dual basis of ei, j ei = ei+1) measures the phase of
the unitary matrix build out of these unitary tangent vectors. the second term
in formula (2.3) can be understood as the condition f m  = 0.
whereas the geometry of the su (2)-slag calibration is nearly trivial, the
su (3) generalization is highly complicated. to get a handle for the compli-
cated case which are relevant for describing n = 1 chiral gauge theories [5]
one is looking for constructive methods connecting bps solutions of dierent
dimensions to each other. as explained in [6] the simplest construction one can
perform on a slag manifold only preserves the property of being a lagrangian
submanifold. therefore we look for bps solutions which are lagrangian but do

have a smoothly varying phase , which is dened by f  = eig dq1  dq2

which leads to the formula

tan  =

f m 
f e 

.

(2.4)

the constraints following from supersymmetry are so restrictive that a non
constant phase  can exist only if we turn on the eld habc.
to indicate the origin of the interesting terms we consider the contribution of
the 4th and 5th term of eq. (2.2) to the bps equations. these terms contain
the dependence on the eld habc. since habc is self dual the purely space like
components can be computed from h0ij . with 0...5 = 1 this yields

with these denitions the fourth term can be rewritten like:

and the last one simplies to

if one does not introduce additional projectors, which further reduce the amount
of supersymmetry, the last equation states that the cycle remains su (n)-slag
but will be deformed by the eld habc. technically speaking the moduli of the
cycle become functions of the eld habc and are partially eliminated in favour
of the degrees of freedom of the eld habc. one the other hand breaking susy
further by additional projectors the su (n)-slag conditions will be aected as
we will discuss now.

2.3 investigation of the basic example

now we specialize all considerations for the su (2)-slag example as given in
table 1 which contains the generic behaviour. one can use a duality relation
of the chiral 6d gamma matrices,

a1...an = 

1

(6  n)!

n(n+1)

2

(1)

a1...anan+1...a6 an+1...a6,

(2.5)

to further simplify this expression. we want to put as many as possible -terms
into the form 0 c1c2. writing out the corresponding expression for the 2-cycle
one obtains

(f )abcaxc2 bxc3 c  c2c3 = 2(f )12c1x[12x2] c  12

this has to be discussed for c = 3 , . . . , 5. with the help of the projectors and
the 6d duality relation eq. (2.5) we may compute,

3  12  =  0  12 ,

and f 123 = f 45. similarly we may conclude 045 =  0 12. then the bps
equations read



j = 

1

det(e1)i( 1

axa i 1 1)
i( 2(f 12 + f 45) (1x12x2  2x11x2)  4(f 12 + f 45)) 0 12

2h axc  cxa i a  c + hxa

2

+ . . .

(2.6)

where the dots are the terms for c = 4, 5 implying that that the corresponding
components of f ab vanish. as it stands the cycle remains su (2)-slag and pre-
serves 1/4 of spacetime supersymmetry. in fact for this simple case the closure
of h implies f 45 = f 12 = const. a completely dierent behaviour arises
after breaking further supersymmetries. concretely we will break supersymme-
try by imposing additional projectors which can be translated to the following
modied brane picture below [9]:

from the additional m 2-brane projector 017  =   (a 11d tangent frame
gamma matrices,  a sign) one obtains

and by the construction of a (see eq. 2.1) this is identical to

067  =   16 

0 12  =   1 1 .

this equality generates an inow from the purely h-eld terms to the term
proportional to  1 1 and modies the slag condition while preserving the
lagrangian property4 .
if one writes out the resulting bps equations, one

in addition to this constraints one also has to ensure the closure of the spacetime
3 form hijk = ea
k habc. the simplest way to satisfy the closure of hijk is
to take the components f 12 and f 45 to be constant.
before we discuss the consequence of this choice let us remind some of the
geometrical formulas. the pullbacks of the embedding space dierential forms
4 instead of including the m 2-brane projector 017  =   one could choose 016  =  ,
which modies the lagrangian condition but preserves the other equation. but this case is
not so well suited for our purposes but seems to be the generic one for higher dimensions.

, e  and m  under the map f read

f  = (2x1  1x2) dq1  dq1,

f e  = (1  1x12x2 + 2x11x2) dq1  dq2,
f m  = (1x1 + 2x2) dq1  dq2.

we will need the prefactors in front of the dierentials which we denote by [f ]
and so on. the induced metric on the embedded submanifold m 2 is given by

gij =   1 + (1x1)2 + (1x2)2

1x12x1 + 1x22x2

1x12x1 + 1x22x2

1 + (2x1)2 + (2x2)2 !

and the following algebraic identity

det g = [f m ]2 + [f e ]2 + [f ]2

holds. combining this identity with the bps equation f  = 0 and the bps
equation (2.7) one computes for the phase (eq. 2.4) the expression below,

tan  = 2 (f 12 + f 45)s

(1 + [f e ])2

1  4 (f 12 + f 45)2 (1 + [f e ])2 ,

which is generically not constant. therefore the cycle is su (2)-slag only if the
sum of the two moduli f 12 and f 45 vanishes. furthermore for non vanishing
f 12 + f 45 the cycle is not anymore slag but still a lagrangian submanifold5 .

3 conclusions

we have shown that for the construction of supersymmetric solutions the eld
habc can be used in two alternative directions. turning on the eld habc with-
out further breaking of supersymmetries does not change the class of calibrated
submanifolds one started with but only deforms the cycle inside this class. alter-
natively one can break additional supersymmetries through further projectors,
which would led to supersymmetric solutions which are not covered by the list
of standard calibrations. here we studied the example on an 1/8 supersym-
metric 2-cycle which is still lagrangian. following the construction given in
[6] we conjecture that the lagrangian 2-cycle can be obtained by projecting a
su (3)-slag cycle into a four dimensional subspace. partial evidence for this
conjecture was given in the paper.
the limitations of our calculations are mainly concerned with the restriction to
a at metric sugra background but this can be improved in principle. partial
results are available for nonat backgrounds [11, 12, 7]. these approaches do
have close relations but are dicult to adapt.
