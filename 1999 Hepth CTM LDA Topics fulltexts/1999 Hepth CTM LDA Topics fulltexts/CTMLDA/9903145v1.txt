abstract

we derive the general form of the anomaly for chiral spinors and self-dual an-
tisymmetric tensors living on d-brane and o-plane intersections, using both
path-integral and index theorem methods. we then show that the anomalous
couplings to rr forms of d-branes and o-planes in a general background are
precisely those required to cancel these anomalies through the inow mecha-
nism. this allows, for instance, for local anomaly cancellation in generic orien-
tifold models, the relevant green-schwarz term being given by the sum of the
anomalous couplings of all the d-branes and o-planes in the model.

1. introduction

one of the most important discoveries in the last few years of intense developments
in string theory is that dp-branes and op-planes carry the elementary rr p-form
p = 2p4p [1]. it has also become clear that in a generic string
charges p and 
background new charges with respect to lower rr forms are induced. for example,
a topologically non-trivial gauge bundle induces charges with respect to (p-2n)-forms
[2, 3], whereas the curvature of the tangent and normal bundles induces charges with
respect to (p-4n)-forms [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. all these induced couplings are anomalous
with respect to gauge transformations of the background, and are expected to cancel
possible anomalies on the defects through the inow mechanism [9]. this fact was in-
deed exploited to derive the complete anomalous couplings of a dp-brane by requiring
them to cancel the anomaly arising in the generically chiral world-volume theory on
the intersection of two or more d-branes [5, 6]. the presence of anomalous couplings
for o-planes was instead predicted by string dualities [8], whereas their relevance for
anomaly cancellation has been argued in particular situations [10].

in [11], a direct string computation of the complete anomalous couplings for dp-
branes and op-planes has been given by factorizing magnetic interactions in a generic
string background, conrming the indirect predictions for dp-branes and correcting
and extending those for op-planes. the results are

and have been further checked through disk computations [12, 13], and indirectly in
other contexts (see for instance [14]).
in these formulae, c = n c(n) is the sum
over the pulled-back rr form potentials. f is the eld strength of the d-brane
gauge eld in the chan-paton factors representation  and r, r are the pulled-back
curvature two-forms of the tangent and normal bundles to the world-volume, all in
units of 42. the overall 1/2 normalization has been chosen in order to use later
on standard results for the inow of anomaly, along the lines of [6]. the symbol ch
indicates the chern class in the representation ,

to an anomaly inow on d-brane and o-plane intersections which precisely cancel the
anomalies on the corresponding world-volumes. from a string theory point of view,
the only diagrams which can potentially give an anomaly are the divergent ones. at
the one-loop level, these are the annulus, mobius strip and klein bottle, associated
respectively to brane-brane (bb), brane-orientifold (bo) and orientifold-orientifold
(oo) intersections. the torus is instead always nite, and therefore can not give any
anomaly. this means that even the anomaly of closed string elds living in the bulk
of spacetime is located on orientifold planes. quite in general, it is easy to gure
out what kind of anomalous elds can appear on bb, bo and oo intersections. the
cylinder and the mobius strip are surfaces with boundaries, corresponding to loops
of arbitrary bosonic and fermionic open string states in the ramond (r) and neveu-
schwarz (ns) sectors; the only massless anomalous particle which can arise on bb
and bo intersections is therefore a charged chiral r spinor reduced form d = 10
to d = p + 1. the klein bottle is instead a surface without any boundary, and
corresponds to loops of arbitrary bosonic closed string states in the rr and nsns
sectors; the only massless anomalous particle which can arise on oo intersections is
therefore a neutral rr self-dual antisymmetric tensor, again reduced from d = 10 to
d = p + 1.

a very interesting consequence of this observation is that the anomalies arising
from neutral closed string states have to combine to reproduce that of a self-dual
tensor, whereas the anomalies coming from charged open string states that of chiral
spinors in suitable representations of the gauge group, as we will see. a slight clari-
cation is here needed. in string theory, physical states generically arise after suitable
truncations of the spectrum, implemented by projections like gso,  or orbifold pro-
jections. correspondingly, physical g-loop amplitudes are obtained by summing the
contributions of all possible spin-structures on genus g sufaces. in particular, anoma-
lies appear in the parity-violating part of one-loop amplitudes. in string theory, this
means genus one surfaces in the odd spin-structures, and restricting the analysis to
these spin-structures one can eventually identify which states, among those propagat-
ing in the loop, are responsible for potential anomalies. as we have argued, these are
a chiral spinor on bb and bo intersections and a self-dual tensor on oo intersections.
the point is that these states do not need to appear in the physical string spectrum;
they might be projected out in the truncated theory, but neverthless appear in dif-
ferent surfaces contributing to the same amplitudes. on the other hand, the inow
mechanism which will cancel these anomalies, that is nothing but the tree-level closed
channel interpretation of the same diagrams, has to involve the exchange of physical
rr forms only, appearing indeed in the eective action.

as a concrete example, consider for instance type iib orientifolds. since the
type iib theory one starts with in d = 10 is chiral but anomaly free, any orientifold
construction satisfying all consistency requirements of string theory, like in particular
tadpole cancellation, has to yield a theory which is automatically free of anomalies.
however, it is well known that the massless elds arising in a generic orientifold
model will in general give a non-vanishing anomaly. this implies that the d-branes
and o-planes present in the model have to contribute an equal and opposite anomaly
through the inow mechanism. this is nothing but a generalization of the green-
schwarz (gs) mechanism [15], the gs term being given by the sum of the anomalous
couplings of all the d-branes and o-planes in the model, including possible additional

3

anomalous couplings to rr forms coming from twisted string sectors.

having identied the potentially anomalous states living on d-brane/o-plane in-
tersections, we will consider in a more general context the possible anomalies arising
from chiral spinors and self-dual antisymmetric tensors propagating in a given sub-
manifold of spacetime, but in interaction with gravity of all spacetime.

the plan of the paper is the following.

in section 2 we compute the general
form of the anomaly for chiral spinors and self-dual antisymmetric tensors coupling
to both the tangent and the normal bundle curvatures, generalizing some standard
results [16] (see also [17] for an extended review of anomalies in eld theory). using
fujikawas approach [18], we rst relate these anomalies to chiral anomalies, which
can then be interpreted as indices of classical complexes endowed with an additional
group action. we then compute these indices in two dierent ways. the rst more
physical approach consists in regularizing the index as the high-temperature limit of
the partition function of a suitable supersymmetric theory, as in [19, 16, 20]. the
second is more mathematical and relies on the application of the so-called index
and g-index theorems [21, 22]. although the general form of the anomaly for chiral
spinors has been already obtained in [6] by using the family index theorem [23], we
will re-derive and conrm this result in the next sections in the two dierent ways
mentioned above. in particular, the explicit computation based on a supersymmetric
quantum mechanics, obtained as the reduction of the supersymmetric non-linear -
model [24] from 1+1 to 0+1 dimensions with some constraints on the elds, will turn
out to be very instructive due to its close connection to the open string -model in
a curved d-brane background.
in section 3 we give a detailed description of the
anomaly inow on d-brane/o-plane intersections, showing that it always precisely
cancels world-volume eld theory anomalies.
in section 4 we apply our results to
some type iib orientifold models, discuss general features of anomaly cancellation in
these models and nally in last section we give some conclusions.

2. anomalies for spinors and tensors

as explained in the introduction, we need to compute the anomaly for a chiral
spinor eld and a self-dual antisymmetric tensor eld (that is with a self-dual eld
strength) reduced from some d-dimensional manifold x to a submanifold m  x
of dimension d < d. more precisely, with the term reduced we mean here the
generalization to a non-trivial normal bundle of the usual dimensional reduction. re-
call that upon dimensional reduction from d to d dimensions, the d-dimensional
lorentz group is broken to the d-dimensional lorentz group plus an r-symmetry cor-
responding to rotations in the (d d)-dimensional transverse space: so(d 1, 1) 
so(d  1, 1)  so(d  d). the tangent bundle to x restricted to m decomposes as
the whitney sum of the tangent and normal bundles to m:

t (x)|m = t (m)  n(m) .

(2.1)

correspondingly, a eld in d dimensions in some representation r of so(d1, 1) de-
composes into various multiplets of elds in d dimensions, in representations (ri
1, ri
2)
of so(d  1, 1)  so(d  d). more precisely, a section of t (x) in some represen-
1, ri
tation r will decompose into sections of t (m)  n(m) in representations (ri
2).
for simplicity and motivated by d-brane physics, we will consider elds that couple

4

only to gravity on x, restricting any possible gauge eld to connections on bundles
over m.

under the above reduction, local lorentz symmetry (or general covariance) on x
is broken to local lorentz symmetry on m and local r-symmetry on the tranverse
space. the former is just standard gravity seen as a gauge theory whose gauge
eld is the spin connection on the tangent bundle t (m), the elds transforming in
the ri
1 representations. the latter corresponds instead to a gauge symmetry under
which the elds transform in the ri
2 representations, the gauge eld associated to this
gauge symmetry being simply the spin connection on the normal bundle n(m). any
1, ri
anomalous representation r will decompose into pairs of representations (ri
2) and
( ri
2 and ri
2) related by conjugation. if n(m) is trivial, the representations ri
2
are equivalent and the two components ri
1 will give an equal and opposite
contribution to the anomaly, which will therefore vanish. on the other hand, if
n(m) is non-trivial, so are the bundles lifted from it in the ri
2 representations,
and the latter are no longer equivalent; the two components ri
1 can then give
unbalanced contributions and the anomaly can be non-vanishing.

in the following we use the standard notation for wess-zumino descents. the
anomaly is encoded in a closed and gauge-invariant sum of forms i, function of the
curvature 2-forms of the gauge, tangent and normal bundles. apart from a possible
constant term i0, this will also be exact, since so are the curvatures: i  i0 = di (0).
i (0) is not gauge invariant; rather its gauge variation denes the wess-zumino descent
i (1): i (0) = di (1). anomalies in eld theory always have the form a = 2irm i (1);

this ensures that the wess-zumino consistency condition is automatically satised.

2.1. path-integral computation

as anticipated, we will rst use fujikawas method [18] to compute the anomaly
for a reduced chiral spinor and self-dual antisymmetric tensor. in this approach, the
anomaly is attributed to the jacobian arising from the non-invariant path-integral
measure under a generic background gauge transformation . this method presents
the advantage of being very easily generalized to the case in which the eld is reduced
to a lower dimensional manifold. it will prove very convenient to use the strategy of
looking at the reduced case as the unreduced case with a constraint. correspondingly,
the generic gauge variation  contains gauge transformations and reparametrizations
of both the tangent and the normal bundle. since the dependence of the anomaly on
the gauge eld in the reduced case is the same as in the standard unreduced case, we
shall concentrate in the following on the gravitational part.

in the spirit of [16], we regularize the ill-dened traces encoding the anomaly as
the high-temperature limits of partition functions of suitable supersymmetric theories.
these will turn out to be dierent versions of the supersymmetric non-linear -model
[24] reduced from 1+1 down to 0+1 dimensions, whose lagrangian is

whereas greek and latin indices , , ..., i, j, ... denote respectively coordinates on
m and the transverse space to it in x; underlined indices denote instead at indices,
non-underlined ones being curved.

2.1.1 chiral spinor

consider rst a chiral spinor. in the usual unreduced case, the jacobian giving the
gauge and/or the gravitational anomaly can be written as [16]

ax = lim
t0

tr [d+1et(i/dx )2

]

(2.4)

where d+1 is the chiral matrix in d dimensions, the operator  represents the corre-
sponding gauge and/or gravitational variation and the trace runs over the eigenstates
of h = (i/dx)2, /dx being the dirac operator on x. the operator  can be expo-
nentiated, resulting in a shift in the background elds. the nal result has then to
be restricted to the term which is linear in . this procedure corresponds to the
well known fact that gauge and gravitational anomalies can be obtained from chiral
anomalies by taking the wess-zumino descent.

in the reduced case, in which the chiral spinor propagates on m but couples
through a gauge-like coupling to the normal bundle curvature, the anomaly is still
given by (2.4) but with /dx replaced by the dirac operator /dm on m, that now
includes the connection on the normal bundle of m. again, by exponentiating the
operator , we are left with

zm = lim
t0

tr [d+1et(i/dm )2

] .

(2.5)

a useful way to evaluate (2.5) is by looking for a supersymmetric quantum mechanical
theory whose supercharge is q = i/dm . it is not dicult to check that such a theory
can be obtained by reducing the supersymmetric non-linear -model from 1 + 1 to
0 + 1 dimensions, with neumann boundary conditions for the elds in the directions
inside m and dirichlet boundary conditions for the elds in the remaining directions.


in terms of the elds appearing in (2.2) this means xi = 0, 
1 = 
i

1 = 

2  /2 and
2  i/2. the action (2.2) then leads to the following lagrangian

this is still invariant under a combination of the two supersymmetries of (2.2). more
precisely, the operator q = e


 x is still a conserved supercharge.

after canonical quantization, the s and is satisfy the anticommutation rela-
tions {, } = , {i, j} = ij and {, i} = 0, and generate cliord algebras
on m and the transverse space to it in x. they form therefore bases of forms respec-
tively on m and its transverse space. the canonical momentum  conjugate to x

actually a particular case of the one which was found in [19] to have as supercharge
the dirac operator with an arbitrary gauge connection. finally, the chiral matrix

in order to evaluate this
path-integral, it will be convenient to take the high-temperature limit t  0.

0/4 and euclidean action s0 = te0. the functional integral
is evaluated by expanding the elds as uctuations around these constant paths,

i
x = x
0 + ,  = 
0 +  and i = 
0 + i. in the present case, as we will see, it
will be enough to consider quadratic uctuations and perform a one-loop computation,
since higher loop corrections come with additional powers of t and are irrelevant in
the limit t  0 we are considering. expanding then the lagrangian (2.6) in normal
coordinates [26] around x
0 and keeping only terms at most bilinear in the uctuations,
one nds a quadratic action for the uctuations which depends on the fermionic zero

i
modes 
0 and 
0. the path integral then reduces to the integral over the bosonic
and fermionic zero modes of the determinants arising from the gaussian integration
over the uctuations. the integral over the x
0 s is just the integral over the manifold

i
m, whereas the integrals over the 
0 s and the 
0s select the d-form component

the quadratic lagrangian for the uctuations contains terms with two or less
fermionic zero modes. it is clear that, due to the integrals over fermionic zero modes,
only interactions providing the maximal number of them (that is 2) will be relevant;
indeed, picking up other interactions would increase the total number of vertices
required to provide a sucient number of fermionic zero modes in order to get a
non-vanishing result. among these, we now argue that the t-independent term of
the path integral depends (besides the constant term) only on the terms quadratic in

0 s. the reason is the following: the tree level
the uctuations and bilinear in the 
term l0 contains 4 zero modes and a single power of t, whereas quadratic vertices
are also eectively proportional to t, as we will see, but provide only 2 fermionic
zero modes. the leading contribution to the path-integral for t  0 comes therefore

7

from correlations involving a maximum number of tree-level terms. if d > d/2, this
i
0s, contributing with a power t(dd)/2
term saturates alone the integral over the 

0 s. since the d periodic bosons  give a normalization factor
and providing d  d 
of order td/2, the total power of t becomes t(d2d)/2. we still need to soak up the


remaining 2d  d 
0 s.
it is then clear that only the terms bilinears in the 
0 s
contribute to the leading t-independent term. any other contribution vanishes in the
limit t  0. this shows that we do not need to consider higher-loop contributions and
i
that we can safely neglect all terms proportional to 
0s in the quadratic lagrangian.
if d < d/2, a similar line of arguments shows that the anomaly vanishes.
the eective lagrangian, quadratic in the uctuations and in the  

0 s, is found

note at this point that the inclusion of an arbitrary gauge bundle presents no
diculties. the supersymmetric quantum mechanical model (2.6) has to be extended
in such a way that its supercharge acquires an additional term involving the gauge
connection, reproducing therefore the dirac operator for a charged spinor. this
modication is achieved exactly in the same way as in the standard case [16], and
results in the additional tree-level factor

(2.18)

this is the chiral anomaly of a spinor propagating on m but section of the spin bundle
of x  m. as last step, we have to consider how the operator  is realized, in order
to derive the form of gauge and gravitational anomalies on m. reparametrizations in
x are broken down to reparametrizations of m and rotations in the transverse space.
the former correspond to tangent bundle gauge transformations, a = da,
ij
and the latter to normal bundle gauge transformations, a = di

after canonical quantization. it is then easy to show that exponentiating these op-
erators and expanding in normal coordinates, their net eect in (2.11) is to shift

,  corresponds therefore to take the wess-zumino descent, and the nal result for
the complex chiral spinor anomaly turns out to be, as expected:

ba(r)  e(r)#(1)

2.1.2 self-dual tensor

.

(2.19)

consider now a self-dual tensor interacting with gravity on x. the jacobian giving
the anomaly has been shown to be given by [16]

ax = lim
t0

1
4

tr [det2x ]

(2.20)

where d is the hodge operator in d dimensions and the trace runs over the eigen-
states of h = 2x, with 2x = (d + d)2 the laplace-beltrami operator on x. we
want now to consider gravitational anomalies on m  x, arising by reducing a chiral
tensor from d down to d dimensions. the corresponding expression is obtained from
(2.20) by tracing only over the states propagating on m. however, it is not possible
to follow the same strategy as in the case of the chiral spinor, essentially because
there is no simple theory having the required hamiltonian. indeed, it is well known

9

that the supersymmetric action (2.2) has a hamiltonian which is the laplacian on
forms of the target space [25], but there is no evident deformation of it which could
constrain the dynamics to a submanifold of the target space. fortunately, there is
a second way of restricting the trace, which will make possible the evaluation of the
anomaly: rather than changing the hamiltonian, one can insert in the trace a suitable
operator having the eect of projecting out the unwanted eigenstates. more precisely,
we want to keep only those states with vanishing momentum in the transverse space
to m in x. the appropriate operator to insert turns out to be quite simple and
given by the reection operator i in the transverse space. since i acts on the elds
xm and m in (2.2) with a + and a  sign in the tangent and normal directions to
m, states with non vanishing momentum pi will be reected into orthogonal states
with opposite momentum pi, giving so a vanishing contribution to the trace. we
can therefore extend the trace on the whole set of states propagating on x

am = lim
t0

tr [i d et2x ] .

(2.21)

the trace (2.21) is actually taken, as in the standard case, over all the tensor elds
(dierential forms) on x. however, it is clear that the only non-vanishing contribution
to (2.21) comes from d/2-forms on m, arising from the reduction of the self-dual d/2-
form on x.

as before, the operator  can be exponentiated, resulting in a shift in the back-

ground elds. we are then left with the self-duality anomaly

zm = lim
t0

tr [i d et2x ] .

(2.22)

although the operator i does not commute in general with the hamiltonian 2x,
according to the decomposition (2.1), it commutes with the laplace-beltrami operator
restricted to m. using standard arguments [25], it is then clear that the trace (2.22)
will be again an index.
in order to evaluate (2.22), we regard it as the partition
function for the supersymmetric quantum mechanical model (2.2), whose hamiltonian
is h = 2x. the d operator, which can be interpreted now as ddd, is implemented
as usual by the discrete symmetry , mapping 1  1 and 2  2. only zero
energy states can contribute to (2.22); indeed all the massive ones fall into multiplets
with equal number of eigenstates of i with opposite eigenvalues, and the result is
therefore independent of t. the path integral representation of (2.22) is

temperature limit t  0. in that limit, (2.23) is dominated by constant paths and

the same considerations as in the spinor case, the t-independent term in the path

the constant tree-level part of the action again contributes as in (2.13). the
evaluation of the one-loop determinants presents no diculties, a part from impor-
tant normalizations which can be xed by relying again on -function regularization.
one nds in this way the following results for the two bosonic and four fermionic

where the last step is valid for the d-form component. this result can be nally
rewritten as

bl(r)  e(r) .

(2.27)

again the realization of  does not present particular problems. the form of the
gauge transformations can be obtained by thinking of the self-dual tensor as a bispinor
[16]. the operators  and  are in this case represented by

upon canonical quantization. as before, one can exponentiate these operators and
expand in normal coordinates. the net eect in (2.24) is again to shift r 
r + d  d and rij  rij + dij  dji. therefore, taking the terms linear

11

in ,  again corresponds to take the wess-zumino descent, and the nal result for
the real self-dual antisymmetric tensor anomaly is

am = 2izm"

bl(r)  e(r)#(1)

.

(2.28)

the additional factor of 1/2 arises as in [16]: for the anomaly the relevant component
of the integrand is the (d+2)-form, whereas it was the d-form component in (2.27),
so the rescaling in the second line of (2.26) produces an extra factor of 1/2.

2.2. index and g-index theorems

in last subsection we have computed the anomalies associated to chiral spinors
and tensors propagating on a submanifold m of x, in interaction with gravitational
elds propagating on x, by working out suitable path integrals. the results are
indices encoding topological data of m and/or x. in order to check the path integral
computation and to have a better understanding of the mathematical nature of the
anomalies we have found, we will also compute directly the indices (2.18),(2.27),
using the atiyah-singer index theorem and its g-index generalization [21, 22] (see
also [19, 20] for related applications of index theorems).

2.3. chiral spinor

it is well known that the index of the dirac operator in an even dimensional
manifold x gives the chiral anomaly of a dirac spinor on x. through the descent
procedure, this is also related to gauge and gravitational anomalies of a chiral spinor
in two lower dimensions. the close relation between index theory and anomalies can
be also used in the case we are interested in, i.e. a chiral spinor propagating on
a even dimensional submanifold m of x. although the chiral anomaly (2.18) has
been already obtained in [6] using the family index theorem [23], for completeness we
re-derive here that result using the standard index theorem [21].

given the tangent bundle decomposition of x as the whitney sum of the tangent
and normal bundles of m, the corresponding positive and negative chirality spin
bundles s
t (x) decompose as follows in terms of the positive and negative chirality
spin bundles s

n (m ) lifted from the tangent and normal bundles to m:

t (m ) and s

s
t (x)  [ s

t (m )  s+

n (m ) ]  [ s

t (m )  s

n (m ) ] .

(2.29)

the dirac operator for the charged and reduced fermion we are considering acts on
sections of the bundles (2.29) tensored with the gauge bundle v in the representation
 in which the fermion transforms, interchanging positive and negative chiralities.
more precisely, we have the two-term complex

where

i/d : (m, e+)  (m, e)

e =(cid:16)[ s

t (m )  s+

n (m ) ]  [ s

t (m )  s

n (m ) ](cid:17)  v .

it is now straightforward to apply the usual index theorem to the particular case

of the two-term complex (2.30). one nds

index(i/d) = (1)

d(d+1)

12

(2.30)

(2.31)

where td(t (m c)) is the todd class of the complexied tangent bundle of m and
d = dim m. the chern characters of the spin bundles are:

ch(s+

t (m )  s

t (m )) =

ch(s+

n (m )  s

n (m )) =

d/2yi=1

i/2) ,

with d = dim x and xi, x
i respectively the eigenvalues of the curvature two-form
on t (m) and n(m) (note that x = /2 dened before). by using the standard
expressions for the euler and todd classes, one then easily reproduces (2.18):

index(i/d) = zm

2.4. self-dual tensor

ch(v )  ba(r)

ba(r)  e(r) .

(2.32)

let us now turn our attention to self-dual tensors. again, through the descent
procedure, the gravitational anomaly on a 4n+2 dimensional manifold is related to
the index of a classical complex over a 4n+4 dimensional manifold x, the signature
complex:

d+ : + t x   t x .

(2.33)
d+ maps self-dual forms to anti self-dual forms on x. in the case we are interested, the
tensors propagate on m  x, but they are sections of  t x. from the results of last
section, we learned that a suitable operator that projects onto states propagating on
m only is the z2 operator acting on the normal coordinates: if (x, yi) are respectively
local coordinates on m and its transverse space in x, then

z2 : (x, yi)  (x,yi) .

(2.34)

what we have to compute is then the so-called g-index [22] of the signature complex,
or simply the g-signature, where g = z2. generically, g can be a compact lie
group acting on x by orientation-preserving transformations1 (see [27] for a nice
introduction and more details on the g-index). the action of g on x can be also
extended to vector bundles over x, provided that g acts on the bundle e mapping
linearly the ber on the point x to the ber on gx, g  g. in this case e is also
called a g-bundle. let then xg  x be the subspace left invariant by g, that is
xg = {x  x : gx = x,g  g}. let us also denote with tg and ng respectively
the tangent and normal bundles of xg in x. the g-signature is then given by (see
e.g. [27])

ch(t +

+) =zx g

index(dg
g = t xg, n 
where e(tg) and td(t c
g =
 n xg and ng = i()i i n xg. if eg is a g-bundle, in general eg = ie(i)

13

where g acts with the element gi in e(i)

chg(eg) = pi tr gi exp{ifi/2} where fi is the curvature 2-form on e(i)

g . in this case, the chern character chg reads
g . in our
particular case, g = z2 and clearly xz2 = m, tz2 = t (m) and nz2 = n(m). t (m)
and n(m) are g-bundles in which z2 acts respectively with the elements i and -i.

3. inow on d-brane and o-plane intersections

in previous sections, we have shown that the anomaly polynomials for the chiral

spinors and self-dual tensors living on overlapping d-brane/o-planes are given by

(2.36)

(3.1)

(3.2)

i 

1/2(f, r, r) = ch(f )  ba(r)
8 bl(r)
bl(r)  e(r) .
ia(r, r) = 

ba(r)  e(r) ,

1

in this section we show that these anomalies are exactly cancelled by the inow of
anomaly associated to the anomalous couplings (1.1) and (1.2). to this aim, we shall
briey recall how the inow mechanism works in the general case, following [6].

consider a set of defects mi in spacetime x with anomalous couplings of the form

s = xi

i

2 zmi

c  yi .

(3.3)

, as c  h  y (0)

by integrating by parts, the integrand can be rewritten in terms of the constant
parts yi0, which we set to 1 by suitably normalizing the charges i, and the descents
y (0)
, the sign depending on whether c contains even (type iib)
i
or odd (type iia) forms. the complete action for the rr elds in presence of this
sources can then be written as an integral over all of spacetime x by using a current
representative mi in the space which is dual in x to the forms on mi:

i

s = 

1

4zx

h  h xi

i

2 zx

i (cid:17) .
mi(cid:16)c  h  y (0)

(3.4)

mi is itself a form of rank equal to the codimension d  di of mi in x. locally,
it can be represented by a generalization to forms of diracs -function given by

14

mi  (xdi)...(xd)dxdi  ...  dxd. globally, it is however a section of the normal
bundle n(mi). the equations of motion and bianchi identity implied by (3.4) are

dh = xi
dh = xi

imi  yi ,
imi  yi ,

(3.5)

(3.6)

where yi is obtained from yi by complex conjugation of the gauge group represen-
tation. moreover, for consistency one must have vanishing total charge for the top
rr form. it is clear form the modied bianchi identity (3.6) that the eld-strength
h cannot be identied anymore with dc. rather, the minimal solution of (3.6) is
. since h, being a physical observable, must be gauge in-
variant, c must acquire an anomalous gauge transformation to compensate the gauge
. consequently, under a gauge

h = dc pi imi  y (0)
variation of the second term: c = pi imi  y (1)

transformation  the couplings (3.3) present an anomaly given by

i

i

(is) =  ixi,j

ij

2 zx

mi  mj(cid:16)yi  yj(cid:17)(1)

.

(3.7)

all the anomaly is localized on the intersections mij of pairs of defects mi and mj.
in order to see this explicitly and correctly, remember that mi are sections of the
normal bundles n(mi), with compact support on it. the current is then well dened
on n(mi) and represented on mi by taking the zero section of n(mi). it is now a
standard result (see for instance [28]) that in cohomology mi can be identied with
the thom class [n(mi)] of n(mi), whose zero section is the euler class of n(mi).
this implies the following property for the currents [6]: mi  mj = mij  e(n(mij)).
using the freedom left over in the descent procedure, the inow can then be rewritten
as

(is) =  ixi,j

ij

2 zmijh(cid:16)yi  yj(cid:17)  e(nij)i(1)

.

(3.8)

it is now straightforward to use this result to show that the anomalies (3.1) and
(3.2) are cancelled by the inows on bb, bo and oo intersections. specializing
to two overlapping defects on the same manifold m, the inow of anomaly can be

written as aij = 2irmij i (1)

ij with

iij = 

ij
4

yi  yj  e(nij) .

(3.9)

we set d = p + 1 but keep d generic, and use the couplings (1.1) and (1.2)
for a dp-brane and an op-plane.
it is easily seen that the d-form part in (3.9)
has precisely the right powers of (42) to cancel the factor (42)(p+1)/2 in the
charges i,j. the eective dp-brane and op-plane charges are then p = 2 and
p = 2p+1d/22. the numerical coecient  depends on the particular model,

and we will derive it case by case. the anomaly inows on the bb, bo and oo are
the following:

bb intersection
using the property ch1(f )  ch2(f ) = ch12(f ), one nds

ibb(f, r, r) = 

2
2

ch(f )  ba(r)

ba(r)  e(r)

15

(3.10)

that is

bo intersection

ibb(f, r, r) = 

2
2

i 
1/2 (f, r, r) .

(3.11)

using the relations ch1(f ) + ch2(f ) = ch12(f ) and ba(r)  bl(r/4) = ba(r/2),

one nds in this case

ibo+ob(f, r, r) = 2p+1 d

2

2
2

ba(r/2)  e(r)

ch(f )  ba(r/2)
ba(r)  e(r) .

ch(2f )  ba(r)

2
4

the second line is obtained by rescaling the argument of the euler class by 1/2,
, and then rescale all the arguments by factor 2, giving an
producing a factor 2
additional factor 2 p+3

for the relevant (p+3)-form component. therefore

dp1

2

2

ibo+ob(f, r, r) =

i 
1/2 (2f, r, r) .

(3.13)

ioo(f, r, r) = 4p+1 d
bl(r/4)  e(r)
8 bl(r)
bl(r)  e(r)

= 

2

where the second equality follows from manipulations similar to those performed
before. then

ioo(r, r) = 2ia(r, r) .

(3.15)

this demonstrate that the anomaly inow on d-branes and o-planes intersections
have the required form to cancel the anomaly of the elds living on them. one has
chiral spinors in the representation    of the gauge group for bb, essentially a
chiral spinor in the representation    of the gauge group for bo, and a self-dual
antisymmetric tensor, neutral under the gauge group, for oo. the precise coecients
depend on the particular model through the parameter . we will show that they
are indeed correct and discuss them in more detail for some particular type iib
orientifolds in next section.

4. anomaly cancellation in type iib orientifolds

in this section, we shall discuss some simple examples of type iib orientifold
models and discuss anomaly cancellation in the light of our results. in the follow-
ing we will consider two simple examples: type i theory in d = 10 and the t 4/z2
orientifold model in d = 6 dimensions [29, 30]. although in both cases the cancel-
lation of spacetime anomalies is well understood [15, 31], our aim will be simply to

16

reinterpret those results as special cases of the inow mechanism discussed in the
previous sections. in particular, we will explicitly show that, as mentioned in the in-
troduction, the anomaly coming from neutral states combines into that of a self-dual
antisymmetric tensor (oo), whereas the one from charged states can be recast into
that of chiral spinors, essentially in the bifundamental (bb) and fundamental (bo)
representations of the gauge group. moreover, the coecients will turn out to be pre-
cisely those required to cancel these anomalies by the inow mechanism. we will also
briey discuss the anomaly coming from neutral elds in other t 4zn orientifolds. a
detailed and complete account of how this mechanism can be extended to these and
more general six-dimensional models [32, 33, 34], for which an analysis of anomaly
cancellation is still lacking, will be reported elsewhere.

in the following, we will make use of the following relations between the anomaly

polynomial of dierent elds:

d = 10 : i1/2(r)  i3/2(r)  ia(r) = 0
d = 6 :

21 i1/2(r)  i3/2(r) + 8 ia(r) = 0

(4.1)

(4.2)

where i1/2(r), ia(r) and i3/2(r) are the standard gravitational anomaly polynomials
for spinors, antisymmetric tensors and rarita-schwinger elds [16].

4.1. type i theory

consider rst type i theory in d = 10 as the simplest type iib orientifold [36].
taking n9 d9-branes together with 1 o9-plane, the gauge group would be so(n9),
and consistency of the theory requires n9 = 32 [15].

one-loop anomalies
keeping n9 arbitrary, the anomalous elds in the model are the following

1
2
n9(n91)

2

1
2

i3/2(r)

i1/2(r) +

 1 grav. mult.: 
1
i
 1 vec. mult.:
1/2
2
where the factors 1/2 are due to the fact that all fermions are real. using (4.1), the
total anomaly from neutral elds is therefore

(f, r)

in(r) = 

1
2

ia(r) .

(4.3)

for the charged elds, it is convenient to rewrite the trace in the adjoint n9(n9  1)/2
in terms of traces in the fundamental n9. it is not dicult to verify order by order
that for so(n) one has

ch n(n1)

(f ) =

2

1
2

(chnn(f )  chn(2f )) .

the anomaly from charged elds can then be written as

ic(f, r) =

1
4

i n9n9
1/2

(f, r) 

1
4

i n9
1/2(2f, r) .

(4.4)

(4.5)

17

anomaly inow
consider now the inows on the d9d9, d9o9 and o9o9 intersections. the chan-
paton representation  is the fundamental n9. using then the formulae derived in
last section one nds

2
2

i n9n9

(f, r) ,

ibb(f, r) = 
ibo+ob(f, r) =

2
2
ioo(r) = 2ia(r) .

i n9
1/2(2f, r) ,

(4.6)

we see therefore that the inow cancels precisely the anomalies (4.3) and (4.5) only
if  = 1/2. this is indeed the correct value for type i d-branes and o-planes [35].
we have therefore veried in this simple case that the inow on bb, bo and oo
exactly cancels respectively the anomalies of the charged and neutral elds. moreover,
it is very clear from this way of doing that the requirement n9 = 32 appears exclusively
from charge cancellation. notice also that the requirement of vanishing irreducible
terms in the anomaly polynomial trf 6, trr6 is equivalent to charge cancellation for
the 10-form rr potential. indeed, the inow necessary to cancel these terms would
involve the 10-form and require the presence of a clearly inexistent magnetic dual
(-2)-form with anomalous couplings proportional to c(2)  trf 6, c(2)  trr6 [37].

4.2. k3 orientifolds

consider now t 4/zn orientifolds of type iib theory, which can be interpreted as
generalizations of k3 compactications of type i theory to d = 6. the low energy
eective theory has n = 1 d = 6 supersymmetry, and beside the usual gravitational
and tensor multiplets of n = 1 d = 6 supergravity, it will involve a vector multiplet
in the adjoint representation of the gauge group and a certain number of charged
hyper and neutral tensor matter multiplets, depending on the model. indicating with
nh the number of hyper multiplets and nt the number of additional tensor multiplets,
the total anomaly from neutral elds is found to be, using (4.2),

in(r) = (nt  8)ia(r) + (nt + nh  20)i1/2(r) .

(4.7)

as pointed out in [32] all consistent zn orientifold models have nt + nh = 20. this
condition is closely related to the geometric properties of the underlying k3 surface.
additional models constructed as open descents of gepner models [34] also satisfy
this condition. it is remarkable that the total neutral eld anomaly has the form of
the anomaly of a self-dual tensor:

in(r) = (nt  8)ia(r) .

(4.8)

the total anomaly coming from charged elds must be analyzed model by model.
the simplest example we shall consider in the following is the z2 orientifold with
maximally enhanced gauge group [30]. taking 2n9 d9-branes and 2n5 d5-branes,
together with 1 o9-plane and 16 o5-planes, with all the 2n5 d5-branes at a single
xed-point on top of the corresponding o5-plane, the gauge group is u(n5)  u(n9),
and consistency of the theory requires n5 = n9 = 16 [30]. anomaly cancellation in
this model has been studied in [31], where it was shown that the anomaly factorizes

18

and is cancelled by a generalization of the gs mechanism. we will give here an
interpretation in terms of inows on d-brane/o-plane intersections.

one-loop anomalies
keeping n5,9 arbitrary, the anomalous elds in the z2 model are the following

5, 1)  (1, n2

(4.9)

which is a particular case of (4.8) with nt = 0. for the charged elds, it is as usual
convenient to rewrite the traces in all the representations in terms of traces in the
fundamental representations. for u(n) one has obviously

for the adjoint representation, and one can check order by order that

chn2(f ) = chnn(f )

(chnn(f )  chn(2f ))
for the symmetric and antisymmetric tensor representations.

using the fact that only even powers of the eld strength f appear in the anomaly

means that one has to take the dierences of the chern classes in the two represen-
tations):

the rst three terms contain only trf 2m factors, whereas the last three contain only
trf 2m+1 factors. the latter are therefore entirely responsible for pure abelian and
mixed abelian-non abelian anomalies.

anomaly inow
consider now the inows on the dpdq, dpoq and opoq intersections, with p, q =
5, 9. due to the z2 projection and the consequent appearance of twisted closed
strings, there will be in this case two types of anomaly inow associated to magnetic

19

interactions of the various d-branes and o-planes. the rst one is the usual one,
involving the exchange of untwisted rr forms and the anomalous couplings (1.1)
and (1.2) to them. the second one involves the exchange of twisted rr-forms and
additional anomalous couplings to them, as shown in [31].

consider rst the inow from the untwisted sector. the chan-paton representa-
tion  is in this case (n5  n5, 1)  (1, n9  n9). using then the formulae derived
in last section, one can then compute the inow directly in terms of d=10 rr elds
and then integrate over the compact space. since we have already explicitly taken
into account the singularities at the 16 orbifold xed-points through 16 o5-planes
in the background, we have to integrate over the at torus t 4, rather than the orb-
ifold t 4/z2; otherwise, one would overcount the singularities2. the d9d9, d9o9 and
o9o9 inows vanish when integrated over t 4. the d5d5, d5o5 and o5o5 inows
also vanish, since the normal bundle to them is trivial and the corresponding anoma-
lous couplings vanish as well. the only non-vanishing inows come therefore from
the d5d9, d5o9, o5d9 and o5o9 intersections. the normal bundle is null, and all
the corresponding characteristic classes are equal to 1. one then nds in total

d5d9(f, r) = 2i (n5n5,n9n9)

consider now the inow from the twisted sector. it was shown in [31] that this
cancels the abelian anomaly coming from the charged hyper multiplets in the spec-
trum. the corresponding anomalous couplings are also responsible for a spontaneous
breaking of u(n5)  u(n9) to su(n5)  su(n9). the gauge eld dependence of these
couplings was inferred in [31]. the complete result can be obtained by factorizing
twisted sector magnetic interactions in the odd spin-structure, along the lines of [11].
the mobius strip and klein bottle amplitudes giving the bo and oo twisted mag-
netic interaction vanish trivially. one can thus immediatly conclude that o-planes
do not have anomalous couplings to twisted rr forms. for the cylinder encoding bb
twisted magnetic interactions, the gravitational part is unaltered, whereas the net ef-
fect of the twist is a conjugation of chan-paton wave-function through the symplectic
matrix

d5-branes at xed point i and d9-branes have therefore the following anomalous
couplings to twisted rr forms c tw.

2this can be also seen by integrating the anomalous coupling (1.2) for the o9-plane of type i
theory on t 4/z2, where the anomalous couplings for the 16 o5-planes in the z2 model appear in

due to this property, it is evident that only odd powers of f appear in (4.15). cor-
respondingly, the associated twisted rr forms are 0-forms and their magnetic dual
4-forms, responsible for the inow in this sector. the nal result for the twisted inow
on bb intersections is then

whereas the twisted inow on bo and oo intersections vanish.

we see that the inows (4.13) from the untwisted sector cancel precisely the one
loop anomaly (4.9) of neutral elds and the non-abelian one of charged elds in
eq.(4.12), if one takes  = 1/2. this is indeed the minimal value required by the d1-
d5 dirac quantization condition, since in this model the d5-branes are grouped into
sets of 4 to make a dynamical d5-brane, due to the orientifold projection: 4(2)2 =
2. similarly, the inow (4.17) from the twisted sector cancels the remaining part of
the anomaly in eq.(4.12), if one takes  = 1.

summarizing, we have shown that the anomalous couplings required to cancel all
the one-loop anomalies in the model do indeed arise. similarly to the type i case, the
condition n5 = n9 = 16 comes from the requirement of vanishing irreducible terms in
the anomaly polynomial, again because these would require unphysical propagating
negative forms. this conrms what found in [31].

5. conclusions

in this paper we have computed the anomalies for reduced chiral spinors and self-
dual antisymmetric tensors living on d-brane/o-plane intersections and showed that
these are cancelled through the inow mechanism induced by the couplings (1.1) and
(1.2). the main point is that in any consistent string theory model, the one-loop
anomaly can be recast into a very particular form. the part arising from charged
elds in the open string sector can be recast into the anomaly of a charged spinor
in appropriate representations of the gauge group, whereas the part coming from
neutral elds in the closed string sector has to combine into that of neutral self-dual
antisymmetric tensors. the inows on bb, bo and oo intersections then cancel
these anomalies. the condition that the irreducible part of the anomaly polynomial
cancels is mapped to the absence of inow involving non-existent negative forms.

the relation between inow and anomalies is very clear in string theory, where the
two are related by the usual open-closed duality in the odd spin-structure of poten-
tially divergent annulus, mobius strip and klein bottle diagrams involving d-branes
and o-planes. in the open string channel, they are interpreted as anomalous one-
loop amplitude on the worlvolumes of the corresponding d-branes and/or o-planes,

21

whereas in the closed string channel they correspond to anomalous magnetic inter-
actions responsible for the inow mechanism. extending [15], one could imagine to
compute anomalies in string theory, by studying one-loop correlation functions with
one unphysical external particle probing the breakdown of gauge-invariance. pre-
sumably, the only eect of the unphyiscal vertex will be to implement the descent on
the correlation of the physical vertices. along the lines of [11], the remaining corre-
lation can be exponentiated, reducing the amplitude to an eective supersymmetric
partition function in the odd spin-structure. at that point, due to the topological
nature of the amplitude, one can reduce the (1+1)-dimensional -model to 0+1, the
computation boiling then down to that of section 2.1.

it will be very interesting to discuss string theory compactications in which the
anomaly associated to the normal bundle is potentially non-vanishing. for instance,
this is the case of d-branes, and eventually o-planes, wrapped on supersymmetric
cycles of calabi-yau manifolds. even more interestingly, gravity in transverse space
seems to induce consistent gauge-like couplings for antisymmetric tensors. in presence
of a non-trivial normal bundle, this allows, according to eq.(2.28), mixed anomalies
for self-dual tensors in 4n dimensions.
