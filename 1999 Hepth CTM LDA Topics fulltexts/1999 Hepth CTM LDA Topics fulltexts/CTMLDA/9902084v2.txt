abstract

we apply the formalism of extended brs symmetry to the investigation of the gauge de-
pendence of the eective potential in a spontaneously symmetry broken gauge theory. this
formalism, which includes a set of grassmann parameters dened as the brs variations of
the gauge-xing parameters, allows us to derive in a quick and unambiguous way the related
nielsen identities, which express the physical gauge independence, in a class of generalized t
hooft gauges, of the eective potential. we show in particular that the validity of the nielsen
identities does not require any constraint on the gauge-xing parameters, to the contrary of
some claims found in the literature. we use the method of algebraic renormalization, which
leads to results independent of the particular renormalization scheme used.

1 introduction

the notion of eective potential was rst introduced by euler, heisenberg and schwin-
ger [1] and later applied to studies of spontaneous symmetry breakdown by goldstone,
salam, weinberg and jona-lasinio [2]. unfortunately, an exact computation of the eec-
tive potential is very hard, often the best answer being given for the rst few terms in a
loop expansion [3]-[6]. this is a dicult task, in particular when several interactions are
present, as it is the case in spontaneously broken gauge theories. in such theories, the
calculation of the radiative corrections to the eective potential has long been of interest,
specially in view of its gauge dependence [6]-[13].

however, the problem of gauge (in)dependence may have been obscured by some
confusion between the classical gauge invariant potential vclass, used in order to determine,
at the classical level, the eld conguration  = v corresponding to the minimum of the
energy density, i.e., the classical ground state, and the eective potential ve, dened
after the gauge has been xed. to the contrary of the classical potential, the eective
potential is gauge dependent, even in the tree approximation, i.e., it depends on the
gauge-xing parameters . however its gauge dependence is restricted by the following
nielsen identities [7]:

ve (, )



+ ci(, )

ve(, )

i

= 0 .

(1.1)

here, the argument  of ve denotes the set of classical elds i, i = 1, 2,   , corre-
sponding to the scalar elds of the theory, and  the set of gauge-xing parameters ,
 = 1, 2,   . the function ci(, ) is calculable.

the nielsen identities imply that the potential

v () = ve( (, ), ) ,

where (, ) is solution of the set of dierential equations

 i


= ci( , ) ,

with some boundary condition (, 0) = , is gauge independent:

v ()



= 0 .

for suitable boundary conditions, this potential v () coincides, in the tree approximation,
with the classical gauge invariant potential vclass.

the problem is particularly of relevance in spontaneously broken gauge theories quan-
tized with a t hooft-like gauge condition implying some scalar elds. in this case, at the
value  = v of the scalar elds which minimizes the eective potential  in fact at any
stationary point of the eective potential:

ve (, )

i

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=v

2

= 0 ,

(1.2)

we get, from the nielsen identities (1.1), the physical gauge independence of the eective
potential, i.e., the gauge independence of its minimum:

= 0 .

(1.3)

ve (, )



(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=v

the meaning of the nielsen identities thus is that the vacuum that realizes the mini-
mum of the eective potential  e.g. the spontaneous symmetry breaking  is a physical
minimum.

in this paper, we revisit the problem of the gauge dependence of the eective potential
and extend the discussion to all orders of perturbation theory. as we have mentioned in
the beginning, indeed, in spite of the large number of papers which have looked carefully
at it, a lot of confusion has arisen in the literature, in the context of a class of gauge
models quantized with generalized t hooft gauges. for instance, it is claimed in [9] that
for a gauge-xing term of the form

gf = z d4x

1

2(cid:16)aa

 + aii(cid:17)2

,

(1.4)

where ai and  are the gauge parameters, the nielsen identities can be derived only if
the ais are -independent and if aivi = 0, vi being the vacuum expectation value of
i. on the other hand, the authors of [10, 11] have derived the nielsen identities also
for the case of ai depending on , ai = f ()ai. but they still demand that ai be
perpendicular to the direction of symmetry breakdown, i.e., aivi = 0. in both cases,
this condition of transversality arose from the procedure followed there, which consists in
including rst the gauge-xing term in the action and only then minimizing the potential
 which of course is gauge dependent, already at the tree level. moreover, if one tries to
minimize this gauge dependent potential, one nds, as presented in [6], spurious gauge
dependent solutions corresponding to other stationary points, in addition to the usual
gauge independent symmetry breaking minima. therefore, for the nielsen identities to
hold  thus removing these unphysical minima  such constraints as aivi = 0 should be
imposed, according to the argumentation of [9]-[13]. at this point we would like to make
another comment concerning the orthogonality condition, aivi = 0, imposed, a posteriori,
as a necessary condition to have the nielsen identities satised by the eective potential.
it sounds at least strange such a condition by the fact that, if we think in the other way
around by choosing a particular direction in the space of the gauge parameters (ai), ai,
the condition aivi = 0 would establish an orthogonal subspace of the correct directions
of symmetry breaking, vi! but the ais are simply gauge parameters, roughly speaking,
they could never dictate the rules.

our aim is to show that, to the contrary of the claims above, it is possible to derive
the nielsen identities generally, without any restriction on the gauge parameters. in order
to achieve this, we dene the vacuum  characterized by the vacuum expectation value v
of the scalar eld , around which perturbation theory is developed  at the classical level
already, i.e., without any gauge dependent ambiguity. the gauge-xing is next introduced
in terms of the shifted eld  =   v, which has a vanishing vacuum expectation value.

we shall derive in this way the nielsen identities for a general non-abelian yang-mills
gauge theory with scalar and spinor matter elds in a t hooft-like gauge. we use the

3

techniques of extended brs invariance [14, 15, 16], which has been introduced precisely
in view of investigating and controlling the gauge dependence in any gauge theory, in
particular the gauge independence of the physical quantities. as we shall see, the nielsen
identities follow straightforwardly from the slavnov-taylor identity associated to extended
brs invariance4. although we specialize the analysis to the case of a semi-simple lie
group for the sake of simplicity, our results obviously hold for the case of a general compact
gauge group too, provided all the elds remain massive. the renormalizability of such
a theory has indeed been proven in [17], the generalization to extended brs invariance
being straightforward.

note. a derivation of the nielsen identities, based on brs invariance, has already been
given in [18], for the abelian higgs model in the t hooft gauge, and in [19] for a more
general gauge model. our presentation, however, diers from the latters in the amount
that we emphasize the use of extended brs invariance, which allows to derive the result in
a quick and elegant way and staying on the rm basis of rigorous renormalization theory.

the plan of the paper is as follows. first, in order to provide the necessary basis
for the unfamiliarized reader, we review in section 2 the construction of the brs and
extended brs invariant theory in the tree-graph approximation, described by a classical
action obeying functional identities characterizing the gauge-xing and the (extended)
brs invariance. we show, at the end of this section, how extended brs invariance does
control the gauge (in)dependence. the renormalized theory is described at the beginning
of section 3, which continues with the derivation of the nielsen identities for the eective
potential.

n.b. in order to avoid infrared problems in the denition of the eective potential, we
shall work with massive elds only. the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking
will thus be assumed to provide nonzero masses to all physical elds  scalars, fermions
and gauge bosons. the choice of a generalized t hooft gauge then ensures nonvanishing
masses for all unphysical (ghost) elds which, in any case, decouple from the physical
sector of the theory due to brs invariance, as it is well-known [20, 21].

2 extended brs symmetry in the classical approx-

imation

2.1 the classical theory: spontaneous breakdown of gauge

invariance

matter is described by a set of scalar and spinor elds, i(x) (i = 1, . . . , n) and i(x)
(i = 1, . . . , n), respectively, belonging to some unitary representation of a semi-simple
lie group g5. the matter elds carrying an anti-hermitian fully reducible representation

4the formalism of extended brs symmetry has also been used by the author of [10].
5it should be stressed that, as pointed out previously, it could be considered here a nonsemi-simple

gauge group, but for the sake of simplicity we restrict our case to a semi-simple one.

the form of the potential,

(2.8)

is chosen such as to ensure the broken regime, i.e. 2
ij < 0, and hijkl must be positive-
denite for the sake of stability of the system, guaranteeing, therefore, the validity of
perturbation theory. in the classical theory, the potential is the energy density for constant
scalar elds  all other elds vanishing. the equilibrium state (the fundamental state,
or vacuum state) is given by the eld conguration which minimizes the energy density.
this minimum is obtained at some value6 i = vi function of the parameters 2
ij, hijkl.
this value is interpreted in the corresponding quantum theory as the vacuum expectation
value of the eld . the equilibrium  or vacuum  state not being invariant under the
gauge transformations, gauge invariance is said to be spontaneously broken.

6in fact, the condition of minimum does not determine vi uniquely, but only up to a group transfor-
mation: it xes an orbit in the space of scalar elds. one has to choose one particular  arbitrary  value
in the orbit.

5

in order to study the small oscillations around the equilibrium/vacuum state  which
gives rise to the physical particle interpretation in the quantum case  one proceeds to
the change of variables

(2.9)
where i are the higgs scalars, all with vanishing vacuum expectation values, such that

,

i = vi + i

= 0 , where

ve( ) = v(v + ) .

(2.10)

let us recall that the mass matrix of the scalar elds satises the eigenvalue equation

in the following we shall assume that all the vector elds acquire a mass. for the scalar
elds the same will be achieved by a suitable choice of the gauge-xing condition.

2.2 gauge-xing

since from now on we shall work in terms of the shifted elds i (the higgs scalars) with
vanishing vacuum expectation value, we will omit, therefore, the tilde symbol.

in order to quantize the theory one has to x the gauge. we rst require invariance

under the following brs transformations:

sca = 1

sca = ba ,

sba = 0 .

(2.13)

the brs transformations of the matter and gauge elds are their gauge transformations
(2.1), (2.2) and (2.6), with the innitesimal parameters a(x) being replaced by the
anticommuting faddeev-popov ghost elds ca(x). we have also introduced the antighost
elds, ca(x), and the lagrange multiplier elds, ba(x), which will be used in order to dene
the gauge-xing condition. the transformation of the ghosts, ca, was chosen such as to
make the brs operator nilpotent:

s2 = 0 .

the gauge-xing is then dened through the introduction in the action of the gauge
breaking term  brs invariant due to the nilpotency of s:

gf = z d4x (cid:26)ba(cid:16)aa

where ai and  are the gauge parameters. for a generic value of the t hooft parameters

2.3 gauge independence and extended brs invariance

one observes that the gauge dependence of the classical theory is given by

caba ,



ai = sz d4x cai

,

(2.15)

where  is the total action, sum of (2.7) and (2.14). the right-hand sides of (2.15) appear
as a brs-variation, which expresses the unphysical character of the gauge parameters.
this means that the physical quantities such as the s-matrix elements and the green
functions of gauge invariant operators are independent of these parameters [16].

in order to translate later on these equations into a functional form, we introduce
new grassmann variables,  and ai, and dene the brs transformations of the gauge
parameters as follows:

s =  ,

s = 0 ,

sai = ai ,

sai = 0 .

(2.16)

we shall now require invariance under the extended brs transformations [14, 15, 16],
i.e., under the transformations (2.16) taken together with the eld brs transformations
(2.13). this implies the modication of the gauge breaking term (2.14) into:

gf = sz d4x (cid:26)ca(cid:16)aa

(2.17)

the extended brs invariance will allow us to control the gauge parameter dependence
of the theory, in particular it will automatically ensures the conditions (2.15), as we shall
show in subsection 2.5.

2.4 the functional identities

the brs symmetry7 of the model, as well as the gauge-xing we have chosen may be
expressed as functional identities obeyed by the classical action (2.19) dened below.

let us rst write down the slavnov-taylor identity expressing the brs invariance of
the theory. because of the nonlinearity of some of the brs transformations (2.13), we have
to add to the action a term giving their couplings with external elds, the antields,

the antields are brs invariant. thus, from now on, the total classical action is given
by

(0) = inv + gf + ext

,

(2.19)

such that its brs invariance is expressed through the slavnov-taylor (st) identity [15]

b(0) = z d4x  x=aa

(2.21)

(2.22)

(2.23)

bf s(f ) = 0 ,  f ,

(bf )2 = 0 if s(f ) = 0 .

in particular, since the action (0) obeys the st identity (2.20), we have the nilpotency
property (2.23):

(b(0) )2 = 0 .

(2.24)

in addition to the st identity (2.20), the action (2.19) satises the following con-

straints:

 the gauge condition:

(2.26)

it is worth noting that, the right-hand sides of eqs.(2.25)(2.26) being linear in the quan-
tum elds, will not get renormalized.

notice that the classical action obeys the decomposition

where b(0) satises the homogeneous gauge condition and the homogeneous ghost equation

which means that b(0) is independent from ba and depends on ca and on the antields,

i , only through the combinations

a and

(2.28)

(2.29)

2.5 gauge independence

gauge independence follows from dierentiating the st identity (2.20) with respect to 
and ai and later setting  = ai = 0:

(0)

 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)==0

= b(0)  (0)

 !(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)==0

,

(0)

ai (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)==0

= b(0)  (0)

ai !(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)==0

thus, the dependence of the theory on  and ai is automatically restricted to a brs-
variation, as already announced, which means that the physical quantities do not depend
on the gauge parameters. in other words, extended brs invariance takes care of the non-
physical character of the gauge parameters, and the problem of the gauge independence
is reduced to the problem of implementing the st identity to all orders.

.

(2.30)

in order to get a physical interpretation, let us write the st identity in terms of
the generating functional of the green functions8,9, z(j, , qi), where j denotes the
sources of the elds ,  the associated antields and qi a set of brs invariant sources
coupled to the gauge invariant operators10 of the theory. the st identity (2.20) then
writes

sz(j, , qi) = z d4x x=aa

, ca, i , i

z

jba + 

j

z
 + jca

z


+ ai z

ai = 0 . (2.31)

in case of vanishing gauge invariant sources qi, one may deduce from (2.31) the gauge
independence of the s-matrix:




s =


ai s = 0 ,

(2.32)

whereas for vanishing sources, j and jca, one gets the gauge independence of the gener-
ating functional of the green functions of the gauge operators:




z(0, 0, qi) =


ai z(0, 0, qi) = 0 .

(2.33)

8in the classical approximation considered in this section, the green functions are made of tree-graph

contributions only.

9the generating functional of the connected green functions is obtained from the generating func-
tional of the vertex functions  coinciding with the classical action in the tree-graph approximation 
through a legendre transformation with respect to the dynamical elds . exponentiation then yields
the generating functional of the general green functions. see, e.g., [22, 16].

10a gauge invariant operator is dened as an equivalence class of brs-invariant operators modulo

brs-variations  what is called a cohomology class of the nilpotent brs operator.

3 the nielsen identities

3.1 renormalization

for the classical  or tree-graph  approximation of the theory described previously, the
renormalization program consists in preserving all the symmetry properties of the classical
theory in the perturbative construction of a quantum theory. it is well known11 that this is
feasible for the class of models considered in the present paper, up to a possible obstruction
by the adler-bardeen gauge anomaly  which we shall suppose to be absent12.

concretely, the resulting renormalized theory is given by the vertex functional or

generating functional of amputated 1-particle irreducible green functions

(a, , , c, c, b, a, , , c) = (0)(a, , , c, c, b, a, , , c) + o(h) ,

(3.1)

which, in the limit h = 0, coincides with the classical action (2.19) and corresponds to the
tree-graph approximation13. the vertex functional  obeys all the functional identities
depicted in subsection 2.4 and which dene the theory, namely, the st identity (2.20),
the gauge condition (2.25) and the ghost equation (2.26).

3.2 the eective potential and the nielsen identities

the control of the gauge dependence of the green functions is given by the identities
(2.30) for  which, as we have already mentioned, follow from dierentiating the st
identity (2.20) with respect to the gauge parameters:

(3.2)

by setting from now on

we can write eq.(3.2) explicitly as (see eq.(2.21) for the denition of the linearized st
operator b)

(3.4)

11see [16] and the references to the original literature therein.
12this amounts to choose a convenient representation for the spinor elds [16].
13perturbation theory as usual is ordered according to the number of loops in the feynman graphs or,



(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0

equivalently, to the powers of h.

10

the denition of the eective potential [23, 22] involves the vertex functional , with

the dependence of  restricted only to the scalar elds i as follows14:

scalar() = |a==c=c=b=0, and all =0

=

xn=0 xi1,,in

1

i1!    in!z d4x1    d4xn i1in(x1,    , xn)i1(x1)    in(xn) .

(3.5)

one denes the eective potential as the zeroth order term ve() in the expansion of
scalar() involving higher and higher derivatives in the elds i:

scalar() =z d4x nve() + z ij()ij +   o ,

(3.6)

where the rst term involves the sum of all proper functions at zero external momenta,
the second sums all second derivatives at the same point, and so on.
in principle the
functions i(x) remains arbitrary. however, since we wish to compute ve, this can be
achieved by assuming i(x) constant, i(x) = i. now, bearing this in mind, the eective
potential can be written as

ve() = 

xn=0 xi1,,in

1

i1!    in!

i1in(0,    , 0)i1    in ,

(3.7)

where the i1in(0,    , 0)s are the momentum-space vertex functions taken at zero ex-
ternal momenta.

it then follows from the denition of the eective potential and from the gauge depen-
dence equations (3.3) for the vertex functional, that the gauge dependence of the eective
potential ve() is given by

ve

the equations (3.8) are the nielsen identities [7] announced in the introduction. as we
have previously mentioned, there are no constraints on the space of gauge parameters to
be imposed in order to have the nielsen identities satised by the eective potential. this
could be suspected by the main purpose of nielsen identities, the control of the gauge
dependence of the eective potential.

we have thus be able to show how simply and unambiguously the application of the
idea of extended brs invariance [14, 15] to the study of the gauge dependence of the

eective potential leads to the nielsen identities [7] which control this dependence.
particular, for theories quantized in a generalized t hooft gauge, if one properly denes
the theory, no restriction on the gauge parameters is required at all, contrary to some
claims already published in the literature [9]-[13]. this algebraic proof of the validity of
the nielsen identities at all orders in perturbation theory is independent of any particular
renormalization scheme. in spite of this proof was done in the context of simple gauge
groups, the generalization to general compact gauge groups is straightforward, since the
renormalizability of such theories has been rigorously shown in [17].
