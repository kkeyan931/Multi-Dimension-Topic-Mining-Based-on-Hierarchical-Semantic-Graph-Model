abstract

gauge eld congurations appropriate for the infrared region of qcd
are proposed in a submanifold of su(3). some properties of the submanifold
are presented. using the usual action for qcd in the absence of quarks,
connement of these congurations is realized as in the london theory of
meissner eect. choosing a representation for the monopole eld strength, a
string action corresponding to the eective gauge theory action in the infrared
region, is obtained. this conning string action contains the nambu-goto
term, extrinsic curvature action and the euler characteristic of the string
world sheet.

i.introduction

qcd, the gauge theory of strong interaction based on the gauge group
suc(3), exhibits asymptotic freedom [1] in the high energy region and in
this region, the success of the perturbation theory (due to the small coupling
strength of the qcd running coupling constant) has been supported by ex-
perimental results [2].
in the infrared region where the coupling becomes
strong, the perturbation theory cannot be used and the mechanism of con-
nement of the gluons and the quarks is not completely understood. thooft
[3] and mandelstam [4] suggested that magnetic monopoles must play a cru-
cial role in the mechanism of connement. color connement is possibly due
to a dual meissner eect [4,5,6]. this suggests that in the infrared region,
some other variables other than aa
 may be more relevant, and mandelstam
[7] suggested that the monopole plasma is probably a way of parameterizing
the ground state of the conning phase. the idea of thooft [3] is to make
an abelian projection and this has been discussed by mandelstam [7]. in
particular, kondo [8] has examined this for su(2) gauge theory to obtain
an abelian projected eective eld theory. here the non-abelian degrees
of freedom are integrated and the relation between the non-abelian gauge
elds and the monopole conguration is not clear. recently, faddeev and
niemi [9] have proposed a set of variables for describing the infrared region of
4-dimensional su(2) and su(n) gauge theory, continuing the earlier works
of corrigan et.al., [10] and cho [11]. they [9] propose a non-linear sigma
model action as relevant in the infrared region of yang-mills theory. the
author has recently proposed [12] gauge eld congurations for the infrared
region of qcd with su(3) as the gauge group, in which the magnetic con-
nement of gluons and quarks have been realized as in the london theory
of meissner eect. a dual version produces the electric connement as well,
thereby explicitly demonstrating the scenario proposed by nambu [6].

while this eld theoretic approach to connement is based upon the at-
tempts to identify relevant gauge eld congurations as in [9, 12], there is
another approach based upon the string representation as pointed out by
polyakov [13]. starting from the action for compact u(1) gauge theory, he
[13] obtains the action for the conning strings as the rigid string action
(which contains the extrinsic curvature action besides the nambu-goto ac-
tion) in the large wilson loop limit.
it is to be noted here that compact

2

u(1) gauge theory must include the monopole congurations [14]. this im-
portant connection [13] between the gauge elds (including monopole cong-
urations) and strings has been extended to 4-dimensional case by diaman-
tini, quevedo and trugenberger [15] by introducing the antisymmetric kalb-
ramond elds [16] interacting with the monopoles. these studies [13,15]
reveal two important features. first, the string action so obtained contains
besides the nambu-goto action, the extrinsic curvature action, earlier pro-
posed by polyakov [17] and independently by kleinert [18] as relevant to
describe qcd strings. second, the coecient of the extrinsic curvature ac-
tion is found to be negative, as desired by kleinert and chervyakov [19] to
improve the stability of the theory.

it is the purpose of this paper to rst identify the relevant gauge eld con-
gurations in the infrared region of qcd and to obtain an action [12] which
naturally contains the monopole congurations, exhibiting connement and
then to obtain a string representation of this low energy eective action by
going to the euclidean version. in section.ii, the proposed [12] su(3) gauge
eld conguration appropriate in the infrared region of qcd are briey re-
viewed and some properties of the submanifold are obtained in section.iii. an
eective action exhibiting connement is obtained in section.iv. the string
representation of this action (in euclidean space) is obtained in section.v.
the results are summarized in section.vi.

ii. gauge field congurations for the infrared region of qcd.

the suggestions of thooft [3], mandelstam [4,7] and polyakov [13] that
the low energy region of qcd must contain monopole congurations to pro-
vide a mechanism of connement, can be implemented by proposing the
su(3) gauge eld congurations aa

 satisfying

dab

 b = a + g f acb ac

 b = 0,

(1)

where a is an su(3) octet vector  su(3)/z3 and are chosen such that

a a = 1,
1
3

dabc b c =

a,

3

(2)

with dabc as the symmetric gell-mann su(3) tensors. now, in the infrared
region, the gauge group manifold is not the complete su(3) group manifold
spanned by arbitrary as but a submanifold spanned by those as satisfying
(2) and the relevant gauge eld congurations aa
 are determined by (1). the
second relation in (2) is very special to su(3) and will be crucial in what
follows.

a solution to (1) is

aa
 = c a 

4
3g

f abc b c,

(3)

where c is arbitrary. to show that (3) solves (1), we made use of the
following relations

a a = 0,
1
23

dabc (b) c =

a,

which follow from (2), and the relation [21]

f abcf edc =

(aebd  adbe) + daecddbc  dadcdbec,
for the f tensors. we nd a useful relation for the as in (2) as

2

f abcf edc be d = a,

(4)

(5)

(6)

which will be used subsequently. the gauge eld conguration (3) and the
submanifold determined by (2) are proposed as relevant to describe the in-
frared region of qcd.

it is therefore very essential to show, in view of [3,4,7,13], that the pro-
posed congurations (3) admits monopoles necessary for connement. this
will be shown in the section iv. before this, we note two important conse-
quences that follow from (1). a mass term m2 aa
 for the gauge elds
usually cannot be added to the lagrangian due ot its gauge non-invariance.
 b, if
since under a gauge transformation the eld changes as aa

 = dab

aa

4

 = 0, for the aa

we consider gauge transformations within the submanifold (2), then such a
term is allowed in view of (1). second, if we choose a lorentz covariant gauge
aa
s in (3), then there will be no gribov ambiguity [22]
in xing the gauge, in view of (1), as long as we are within the submanifold,
since the gauge variation of the gauge xing condition aa
 b)
identically vanishes. in this way, the non-propoagating ghost requirement of
thooft [3] is satised by the choice of (1).

iii.some properties of the submanifold.

in this section, we consider the nite gauge transformations in the sub-
manifold dened by (2),[23]. the nite gauge transformations here, will be
shown become linear in as. the second relation in (2) upon using the rst
relation becomes dabcabc = 1
3 . it is known [21,24] that, given one octet
vector a, there exists at most two linearly independent octets. they are a
itself and dabcbc. also, it is equally known that at most two independent
su(3) invariants can be formed. they are aa and dabcabc. in view of
(2), we now have only one octet since dabcbc is taken to be 1
3a and the
two said su(3) invariants become constants 1 and 1
3 respectively. these
characterize the submanifold.

consider a gauge transformation generated by

2 ! ,
u = exp ia a

(7)

for s satisfying (2) and as are the gell-mann su(3) matrices. we shall
make use of the basic relation for the - matrices, viz.,

ab = if abcc +

2
3

ab + dabcc,

(8)

where f abc and dabc are the usual anti-symmetric and symmetric su(3) ten-
sors respectively. expanding the exponential in (7), we have

u = 1 + ia a

gives the conditions,

(10)

thus, the nite gauge transformation u becomes linear in . this is a
special feature of the submanifold dened by (2). thus a parameterization
of su(3) in terms of a single real octet vector a is achieved by (9). it has
been shown by macfarlane, sudbery and weisz [21] that any special unitary
matrix u written as exp(ia) with a hermitian and a = aa, can be
written as u = u0 + iuaa, where ua = aa + bdabcbc, with u0, a, b as
functions of the two su(3) invariants, aa and dabcabc. in our choice,
these invariants are taken as constants 1 and 1
3 and this gives (9) for u. we
will relate this u to the rotation matrix of a subgroup of rotations in eight
dimensional euclidean space e8.

6

now, consider a nite gauge transformation due to u in (9). under a
a
2

nite gauge transformation, we know that the gauge eld a = aa

transforms as

a  au

 =

1
i

(u)u1 + u a u1.

(11)

to check the notation and the factors, we nd the innitesimal version of
(11) using (7), is

aa

 = dac

 c,

(12)

as it should be. in view (1), aa
gauge transformations (9) with (10), also a = 0, i.e.,

 = 0. here we want to show that for nite

au

 = a,

(13)

for those aa

s satisfying (1).

we shall make use of the standard relations among f and d tensors [21],

viz.,

and

f imdmjk + f jmdimk + f klmdijm = 0,

f ijmf km =

2
3

(ikj  ijk) + dikmdjm  djkmdim.

(14)

(15)

starting from (9), we have

(u)u1 = (a)a( + bb)

= (a)a + i(a)bf abcc
+ (a)bdabcc,

(16)

where (a)a = 0, following from the rst relation in (2) is used. also,
the second relation in (2) gives

dabc(b)c =

1
23

(a),

(17)

7

and so

(u)u1 = ( +

1
23

)(a)a + i(a)bf abcc.

(18)

we are interested in the transformation of the aa
using (1) in (18), we have

s satisfying (1) and so

(u)u1 = ( +

1
23

)f abcbac

a

+ i(f apqpaq

(19)

using (15) for simplifying f apqf abc, (19) becomes

.

(22)

in here there are fourteen terms. the sixth term and the third term are
like-terms; the seventh and the fourth are like-terms, and the fth and the
second are like-terms. the nineth term vanishes identically. in the thirteenth
term, the second relation in (2) is used. then we nd,

uau1 =

3 ( +  + 1

. (23)

now, the coecient of b terms in (23) is 2
3), which
is zero due to the second relation in (10). using the relation (14) to rewrite
the eighth term f adedbcd as f baddedc  f caddebd, the term involving f cad
vanishes due to the symmetry of ac in a and c. then the remaining of the
eighth term cancells with the sixth term in (23). in the fth term involving
f adef bcd, we make use of (15). then (23) becomes,

uau1 =

now, consider the terms involving two d-tensors. they are,

by changing the summation indices in the second term above, viz., b

then, the terms involving one d-tensor are,

by rearranging the indices, this becomes,

in the second term, make b  c, d  a so that the above expression becomes,

(27)

using the rst relation in (10).

thus when u = exp{ia a

2 } nite transformation is considered, u
becomes  + aa, linear in a in view of (2), with  and  satisfying (10).
this nite transformation leaves a invariant, for those aa
s satisfying (1).
therefore, within the submanifold dened by (2), the gauge elds satisfying
(1) can have a mass term, even for nite transformations.

it will be useful to consider the converse of this result. in order to this,
we ask the question: what will be the gauge eld congurations that remain
unchanged under nite gauge transformations? since under a nite gauge
transformation u, a transforms as,

a  au

 =

1
i

(u)u1 + uau1,

the answer is given by

a =

1
i

(u)u1 + uau1.

by right multiplying the above expression by u, we have

1
i

u + [u, a] = 0,

(28)

whose innitesimal version is (1). this means that for those as and u
satisfying (28), the mass term remain invariant.
in order to give explicit
expressions for aa
 and u, the transformation u is chosen by those s sat-
isfying (2). then (9) gives the required u. the choice of s satisfying (2)
and aa
 in (3) determined by (1), produce magnetic monopole congurations
in the qcd action [12].

it is known that the tensor indices taking eight values in d and f are
tensor indices associated with the adjoint group su(3)/z(3) of su(3). the
tensors d and f associated with su(3)/z(3), are cartesian tensors in eight
real dimensions [24]. given a single octet vector {a} and the tensors d and f ,
it is known that at most two linearly independent octets can be formed. they
are a itself and dabcbc. then at most two independent su(3) invariants

11

can be formed, which are taken as,

aa,
dabcabc.

(29)

a geometric meaning can be given to the invariants. if we associate a 3  3
matrix a with a as a = a a, where as are the gell-mann matrices,
then t r(a2) and det(a) give the above two invariants. in our choice made
in (2), we have taken the two invariants as constants.

a study of the relationship of the adjoint group su(3)/z(3) to the sub-
group of rotation group r8 which leaves invariant the length aa of the real
eight component vector a and the cubic invariant dabcabc has been made
by macfarlane [24]. here we will give the main results for our choice (2). the
eight components a can be taken to describe a point of e8. rotations in
e8 are real linear transformations

a  

a = rabb.

(30)

invariance of the length leads to rrt = i. we take det(r) = 1. to relate
su(3) to a subgroup of r8, the group of rotations in e8, associate with each
point in e8, a 3  3 traceless hermitian matrix a

a = aa,

(31)

an element of the algebra of su(3). transformations of e8 induced by
u  su(3) tansformation

a  a = uau1,

can be shown to give [24]

rab =

1
2

t r{a u b u1}.

for u in (9) and using the relations in (10), we nd explicitly,
3dabcc

rab = (1  )ab + 2ab 

+ ifabcc (  ).

12

(32)

(33)

(34)

it is veried that rabrac = bc, i.e., the transformation is orthogonal. it is
seen that rabb = a. thus the rotation leaves aa invariant. it is seen
that the invariance of dabcabc is veried by showing dabcraprbqrcr =
dpqr.

now, we examine the property of an octet b = aa in the subman-
ifold. this will shed some light on the type of monopole congurations
discussed in the next section.
in order for this, we consider the charac-
teristic equation for the 3  3 matrix b. it is [21] (for the choices in (2),
namely the two su(3) invariants taken as 1 and 1
3, constants.) given by
x3  x  2
33 = 0 with x as the eigenvalues of b. the eigenvalues are found
to be  1
3, showing that in its diagonalized form, b is 8-like.
in this way, the monopole congurations in section.iv, will be 8-like and
the submanifold dened by (2), picks up this conguration. it is possible to
realize the 3-like conguration, by going out of the submanifold, which we
will not do in this study.

in this way, the proposed gauge eld congurations (3) give an action (42)
which contains the monopole congurations. in the attempts [9] to relate
the infrared region of qcd to a non-linear sigma model by expressing aa

in terms na (the sigma model elds), it is to be observed that the qcd
action (39) will produce quartic terms involving the derivatives of na. the
quadratic term in the sigma model action, namely, nana can come only
aa
from the mass term aa
. so, such models [9] implicitly assume the presence
of a mass term for aa
 elds in the qcd lagrangian. such a mass term, if
included, will induce a mass term for the c elds in our approach [12]. in
the partition function z for the action (42), after introducing a mass term
for the c-eld with mass m (for instance by coleman-weinberg mechanism
by introducing complex scalars minimally coupled to c as in [5,7,11]), a
functional integration over c produces an eective lagrangian [12]

v. a string representation of the effective ac-
tion.

in order to nd a string representation of the eld theoretic action (42),
we rst consider its dual form. introducing the dual eld strength g dual
to f, we have

z = z [dc][g]exp{z (

(46)

the functional integral over g produces the partition function for (42).
from (46), variation with respect to the c-eld (f = c  c) gives
{g  4

3 x } = 0, which is solved for g as
4
3

g =  a +

x,

(47)

where the eld a serves as dual to c. using (47) in (46), we eliminate the

z = z [d a]exp[

(48)

this action posseses dual u(1) invariance and coincides with the abelian pro-
jected eective theory of qcd based on su(3) in its dual form. we introduce
a mass term for the a-eld which can arise from coleman-weinberg mech-
anism by invoking complex scalars coupled to a as in the works of [3,4,11].
by functionally integrating the a-eld, we obtain an eective action

(49)

apart from a constant (divergent) factor not involving the elds. this action
suggests a dual connement of gluons in the submanifold as in the london
theory of meissner eect. second, we go over now to the euclidean space.

from (43) and (44) it follows that x represents the eld strength of

magnetic monopole. we make the following choice for x,

x(x) = z d24(x  y)[y, y],

(50)

where [y, y] = ab y
y
b ; a, b = 1, 2, y(1, 2) represents the position
a
of a point on the worldsheet swept by the string of the monopole and 1, 2
are the local coordinates of the worldsheet. in here, we have the nambus
picture [6] in mind that the magnetic ux lines terminate at the end points
(quarks). such a form for x has been earlier suggested by wentzel [25].
quarks exchange the gluons and in the infrared region, the proposed gauge
eld conguration (3) produces an action (42) which contains x. thus it
is consistent with the picture that the magnetic ux lines connect two quarks
or quark - antiquark pair.

now using x = 1
z  x(

and x x = xx. then eqn.49 becomes, (euclidean version),

sef f =

)1xd4x.

(52)

it is to be noted that the second term on the right hand side of eqn.49 is
exactly cancelled by the rst term in (51). we now use the representation
for x (50) and denote [y, y] = (y). it is easy to verify that

 (x)(x) = 2g,

(53)

where g is the determinant of the induced metric gab = ax bx  on the
string worldsheet. the operator (x m2
2 )1 acting on 4(xy) can be evalu-
ated using the procedure outlined by diamantini, quevedo and trugenberger
[15], by derivative expansion of the green function of the operator above. in-
troducing an ultra-violet cut-o  (corresponding to nite thickness of the
worldsheet), the above action (52) becomes

where t = 1
g  and r is the scalar curvature of the worldsheet. here
the rst term is identied with the area term or the nambu-goto action.
the second term is the familiar extrinsic curvature action (see the book by
a.m.polyakov in ref.17, page.284) and the last term is the topological euler
characteristic of the worldsheet. since the action (52) has no coupling pa-
rameters in the strong coupling limit, the coecients in front of the second
third terms are numbers while the coecient in front of the rst term rep-
resents the string tension. the divergent integrals in the ultra-violet cut-o
momentum  are approximated by 2
m2 . eqn.54 represents the string action
for the infrared region of qcd and as we have shown a realization of con-
nement as in the london theory of meissner eect, the above action is the
conning string action. this agrees with ref.15, although they start from
kalb-ramond action with monopoles while we obtain (54) from pure qcd
action in the infrared region characterized by the submanifold (2).

vi. conclusions

su(3) gauge eld congurations appropriate for the infrared region of
qcd are proposed in submanifold of su(3). the usual action of qcd then
contains monopole congurations interacting with f. a dual version is
constructed and is shown to give the connement of these eld congurations
as in meissner eect. a string representation is obtained by choosing a
representation for x in terms of the geometry of the string worldsheet and
by going over to the euclidean version.

the string action which corresponds to connement consists of the nambu-
goto term, extrinsic curvature action and the euler characteristic of the
worldsheet, showing the inevitable occurrence of the extrinsic curvature ac-
tion. in this connection between the gauge eld theory and the string theory,
the origin of the extrinsic curvature action is in the derivative expansion of
the green function for the four dimensional operator (  m2
2 )1 acting on
x which contains the 4-dimensional dirac delta function. the leading
term however gives the nambu-goto action. since the gauge eld action has
been shown to have connement of these gauge elds, one can expect that
the resulting string action also to exhibit connement in the infrared region.
this has been shown by an explicit calculation of the quantum one-loop
partition function of both the nambu-goto action and extrinsic curvature
action by viswanathan and parthasarathy [26], in which the partition func-
tion has been found to be that of a modied cpulomb gas and in the infrared
limit, there are long range interaction responsible for connement while in
the ultra-violet limit, the ux lines curl up to vortices leading to the non-
conning phase of the system.

having realized a mechanism of connement in the infrared region of
qcd, it is pertinent to address the issue of chiral symmetry breaking as
these two issues are related. it has already been shown by nair [27] and nair
and rosenzweig [28] that quarks in the monopole background break chiral
symmetry, i.e., a non-vanishing value for <  > has been obtained in the
monopole background, the mechanism being similar to that of callan [29]
and rubakov [30], except that in qcd, this does not violate avour number.
as we have a monopole conguration realized in (42), by choosing a specic
form for x, chiral symmetry breaking can be realized along the lines of [27]
and [28].
