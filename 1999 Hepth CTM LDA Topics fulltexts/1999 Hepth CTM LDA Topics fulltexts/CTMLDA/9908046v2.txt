abstract

in this paper expressions are given for the bulk and boundary structure constants of d-
series virasoro minimal models on the upper half plane. it is the continuation of an earlier
work on the a-series. the solution for the boundary theory is found rst and then extended
to the bulk. the modular invariant bulk eld content is recovered as the maximal set of
bulk elds consistent with the boundary theory. it is found that the structure constants are
unique up to redenition of the elds and in the chosen normalisation exhibit a manifest
z2symmetry associated to the d-diagram. the solution has been subjected to random
numerical tests against the constraints it has to fulll.

introduction

one of the aims of studying quantum eld theories is to compute correlation functions of the
elds in the theory. in two-dimensional conformal eld theory one uses the presence of an
innite amount of symmetries to achieve this goal.

we will consider a special subclass of conformal eld theories, called minimal models. one
of their properties is that the correlators fulll certain linear dierential equations (see [1] or
e.g. [2] for details). one can nd a distinguished set of solutions to these dierential equations,
called conformal blocks. a correlator can then be expressed as a bilinear combination of these
blocks. to know the coecients in this bilinear combination a set of complex numbers, the
structure constants, are needed. structure constants appear in the short distance expansion
(or operator product expansion, ope) of certain elds in the conformal eld theory, called
primary elds.

in this paper we consider only virasoro minimal models. one approach to calculate all
structure constants is to start in a situation without boundaries. in this case only bulk elds
are present and one can solve the bulk theory alone by determining the conformal blocks and
a consistent set of structure constants for the bulk elds (see [3] for the spinless case).
it
is possible to classify all modular invariant minimal models without boundaries [4] with the
result that they fall into an ade pattern.

starting from a well dened bulk theory one can proceed and introduce a boundary into
the system. as it turns out the dierential equations that the correlators fulll stay the
same, but now the correlator is a linear, not a bilinear, combination of the conformal blocks
mentioned above (see [5]) and furthermore two new sets of structure constants appear: in
addition to the bulk structure constants that determine the ope of two bulk primary elds,
there are the bulk-boundary couplings that describe the expansion of a bulk eld in terms of
boundary elds, and the boundary structure constants for the ope of two boundary elds.

one can now classify all conformally invariant boundary conditions and the boundary
elds that live on these boundaries or interpolate between two adjacent boundary conditions
(see [69]). again one nds an ade pattern for all possible boundary theories [9], plus
tadpole diagrams, which have been discarded as the resulting theory does not match with any
of the modular invariant bulk theories.

all three sets of structure constants can in principle be worked out from six consistency
conditions that arise from taking dierent limits in certain correlators and equating the dier-
ent opes in these limits. the constraints that arise in this way are called sewing constraints
(see [10] and for an extension to non-orientable surfaces [7]). a more general discussion of
the sewing constraints in presence of nontrivial multiplicities and their relation to [11] can be
found in [12].

above we have started from a bulk theory, which can be solved consistently, and then
introduced a boundary. thus the bulk structure constants are known rst and then a solution
for the other two sets of structure constants consistent with these has to be obtained. whereas
the bulk structure constants for diagonal and nondiagonal minimal models can be found in the
literature [3, 13, 14], these calculations have not been carried out for the boundary structure
constants and only for a subset of the bulk-boundary couplings (see [69]).

in this paper and a previous work [15] the missing structure constants for the a and d-
series are calculated by taking the opposite path. the starting point now is a theory with only
boundary elds. one chooses an ade type boundary eld content and tries to determine
a consistent set of boundary structure constants. once this is achieved the boundary theory
is extended to the bulk and it is only at this point that bulk elds are introduced.
it is

1

interesting that one nds that the maximal bulk eld content consistent with the boundary
theory coincides with the modular invariant one given in [4]. the bulk-boundary couplings
and the bulk structure constants can now be obtained from the sewing constraints in a straight
forward way. the results are explicit expressions for all three sets of structure constants in
terms of so called fusion (f) matrices (see appendix a for details and references). the
expressions are free of sign ambiguities (e.g. they do not contain any square roots) so that
they are well suited for numerical computations.

the deven minimal models have a larger symmetry algebra (a walgebra, see [16] and
references therein) that contains the virasoro algebra as subalgebra. in principle one could
understand these conformal eld theories in terms of the w-algebra, with w-algebra chiral
blocks and fmatrices. but since these cfts are still nitely reducible with respect to the
virasoro algebra alone (i.e. only a nite number of irreducible highest weight representations
of the virasoro algebra occur), it is possible and indeed simple to use only the virasoro
symmetry.

the fact that one does not use the fully extended chiral algebra and the possible presence
of multiple copies of primary elds means that the sewing constraints in ref. [10] must be
rederived, which has been done. the results are presented in section 2 and an explicit example
is provided in appendix a.

both, in the a and the dseries, the sewing constraints are overdetermined and only a
subset is used to nd the structure constants. it has to some extend been tested numerically
(but not proven analytically) that the given structure constants solve the full set of constraints.
it is shown that, given the boundary eld content, any solution can be brought to a standard
form by redening the elds.
in other words, under gauge transformations the space of
solutions to the sewing constraints consists of only one orbit.

the formulae for all bulk and boundary structure constants are given in eqns. (43)(47)
and (53)(55). a short description of how to implement them can be found in the conclusion.
the derivation of these expressions is organised as follows:

in section 2 the notation for the various elds and structure constants is introduced and
the rederived sewing constraints for genus zero surfaces are stated in a suitable form. section 3
gives a short description of the procedure introduced in [9] for the construction of cylinder
partition functions. this denes the boundary eld content which is used as input in the
construction of the solution to the sewing constraints. the boundary structure constants are
found in section 4. finally the extension to the bulk theory is carried out in section 5. here
the maximal bulk eld content consistent with the boundary theory is determined and it is
observed to be modular invariant. the remaining structure constants, i.e. the bulk-boundary
couplings and the bulk structure constants are calculated and expressions for the vacuum
expectation value of the unit disc are obtained. a choice of basis is presented which renders
all structure constants real. finally it is observed that a subset of all structure constants is
left invariant under a large number of distinct z2actions.

2 genus zero sewing constraints

unless otherwise mentioned, throughout this paper the boundary conformal eld theory will
be considered on the upper half plane (uhp) with the boundary given by the real line.

in a general virasoro minimal model there can be several primary bulk or boundary elds
transforming in the same highest weight representation(s) of the virasoro algebra. therefore
we cannot label the elds solely by their representations. virasoro highest weight represen-
tations are labelled by small letters i, j, k and to take care of elds with multiplicities these

2

carry an additional greek index i, j, k. boundary conditions are labelled by small letters
a, b, c or also x, y, z.

it is always possible to make the (bulk and boundary) two-point functions diagonal by
an appropriate choice of labels and normalisation of the elds: hi(x)j (y)i=i,j,f (x, y).
a bulk eld i transforms in the tensor product of two virasoro highest weight represen-
tations i. the two representations have conformal weights hi, h or, for better readability,
hi, hi. a boundary eld (ab)
lives between boundary conditions a and b and transforms in
k
one virasoro representation k of conformal weight hk.

the vacuum expectation value of the uhp with boundary condition a imposed on the
uhp. the vacuum expectation value of the full complex plane

real line will be denoted with h1i(a)
with no boundaries present will be denoted with h1i or h0|0i.
product expansions of primary elds are, in this order:

the leading terms in the bulkbulk, bulkboundary and boundaryboundary operator

these constraints have been rederived using notation and techniques for calculating with
conformal blocks presented in [11]. equations (4)(7) require a specic renormalisation of the
fmatrices. this normalisation, together with the explicit derivation of the constraint (6) as
an example are given in appendix a.

the form of the constraints given here is slightly dierent from [10]. first of all only the
virasoro symmetry was used in their derivation and not the maximally extended chiral algebra.
secondly slightly dierent limits in the correlators were chosen so that that the expectation
value of the identity eld cancels from all expressions. furthermore the present notation takes
into account elds with multiplicities (see also [12]). leaving out the sums over multiplicities
and the multiplicity indices, (4)(7) can be rearranged to match the corresponding equations
in [10].

3 cylinder partition function

first a note about a convention used throughout this paper. to take care of the redundancy
in the labelling of representations i with kac-labels (r, s) we will only consider pairs where
r is odd. the set of entries in the kac-table with r odd is in one-to-one correspondence to
virasoro highest weight representations of the given central charge.

before we can begin to solve (4)(7) we need to know which elds are present in the theory.
since our starting point is going to be the boundary theory the rst thing to determine is
the boundary eld content on the upper half plane or, equivalently, the cylinder partition
function.

in ref. [9] a method for the construction of the cylinder partition functions associated to

a pair of lie-algebras an, g is given. here we give a quick summary of this method.

4

3.1 general construction

first choose an odd number p and a number q coprime to p. we will construct the cylinder
partition function of a minimal model with the following central charge:

c = 1  6

(p  q)2

pq

(8)

let a be the adjacency matrix of the dynkin diagram associated to the lie-algebra ap1

and g be the adjacency matrix for a lie-algebra with coxeter number q.

for x=a or x=g dene the matrix valued functions vn(x) recursively via

vn(x) = v2(x)vn1(x)  vn2(x)

; v1(x) = id and v2(x) = x

(9)

the vn are called fused adjacency matrices and form a representation of the verlinde fusion
algebra.

let  be an odd node of a and  be any node of g. then a=(, ) labels the possible
boundary conditions. let a=(, ) and b=(, ). then the partition function of a cylinder
of circumference t and length l with boundary conditions a and b is given by:

vr(a)

za|b = xr=1..p1

s=1..q1

vs(g)

  r,s(q)

; q = exp(t /l)

(10)

when we take the identity r,s = pr,qs for virasoro characters into account we can rewrite
(10) in the following unique way:

za|b = xi=(r odd,s)

nia

b  i(q)

(11)

in refs. [9] the genus one sewing constraint for a cylinder with no eld insertions was
analysed with the result that g has to be the adjacency matrix of an ade type dynkin
diagram or of a tadpole diagram.

the numbers nia

b can be interpreted as the number of times the representation i occurs
in between the boundary conditions a and b and they thus describe the eld content on the
boundary (in this case the real line).

3.2 example: the a-series

b, i.e. the eld content is just
for the pair of lie algebras (ap1, aq1) one nds nia
given by the verlinde fusion numbers [6]. distinct boundary conditions are given by pairings
of an odd node in the rst a-diagram with any node in the second:

b = nia

p1
s

1
, is

q1(cid:27)

(12)

there is a distinguished boundary condition, which we will call 1boundary, that corresponds
to the rst node in each a-diagram, i.e. the (1, 1)-node.

there are no elds with multiplicity and there is a unique eld i=a between the a and
b can be understood as saying that
1boundary:
the representations i that can live between the a and bboundary are exactly those occurring
in the fusion of the representations a and b:

 i=a. the formula nia

3.3 the d-series

here q has to be an even number and the boundary conditions are given by pairings of an
odd node in the a-diagram with any node in the d-diagram:

(13)




in particular the total number of boundary conditions is 1
4 (p 1)(q + 2). again the boundary
condition associated with the rst node of each diagram, i.e. the (1, 1)-node, will get a special
name. it will be called  so that it is not confused with the 1boundary in the a-series. the
boundary will play a role similar to that of the 1boundary in [15].

when looking at the d-series boundary eld content one observes the following: the
boundary conditions can be organised in two categories.
in the rst case, which we will
denote as i-type boundaries, a boundary condition x=(, ) is associated with an odd node
 of the a-diagram and any node  of the d-diagram except for the two at the split end. the
second case we will call n-type. an n-type boundary a is associated with any odd a-node
and one of the two end nodes in the d-diagram.

(14)

the names i-type and n-type stand for invariant and non-invariant and are related to the
z2symmetry of the d-diagram.

carrying through the procedure outlined in section 3.1 one nds that an n-type bound-
 , denoted by au (unique). it has

a

ary a=(, ) has exactly one eld living on
representation labels (, q

2 ).

an i-type boundary x=(, ) has two elds elds living on

 with kac-labels
(, ) and (, q  ) which we will denote by xe and xo (x even and x odd). the labelling
is arbitrary, but we choose to always give the identity eld on the boundary an even label.
 are given in
terms of the node labels of the boundary condition x=(, ) some confusion might arise. but
from the context it will be clear which one of the two interpretations makes sense.

note that since the kac-labels of the representations that live on

x

x

for deniteness we will x a specic even/odd labelling for boundary elds. it will turn
out later that the structure constants involving only i-type boundaries have an explicit z2
symmetry that sends even elds to themselves and odd elds to minus themselves. this
symmetry is not assumed, but a consequence of the constraints and the gauge we choose. fol-
lowing the arguments in [19] we would like the ground state, i.e. the state of lowest conformal
weight, for each pair of boundary conditions to be invariant under that symmetry. this can
 with x=(, ) an i-type boundary by assigning e/o-labels
be achieved for all pairs
to the two representations living between these boundary conditions in the following way:

x

xe =((, )

(, q  )

:  < p
2
:  > p
2

xo =((, q  )

(, )

:  < p
2
:  > p
2

(15)

as discussed in [19] the physical motivation for this choice comes from relating the z2action
to the eect of a disorder line stretching from boundary to boundary on a cylinder and trying
to interpret the resulting amplitude as a partition function.

general it is not possible to x a labelling s.t. the ground state is invariant for all possible
pairs of boundary conditions.

the conformal weight of a highest weight representation with kac-labels (r, s) is given by

hr,s = 1

4pq ((qr  ps)2  (p  q)2). thus with denition (15) we nd:

h(xo)  h(xe) =(cid:12)(cid:12)(  p

2 )(  q
2 )(cid:12)(cid:12)

(16)

in particular the boundary itself is of i-type and it has two elds living on it, the identity
2 odd and

21). we see that h(o) is integer for q

e=1 and the eld o with h(o) = ( p
half-integer for q

21)( q

2 even.

we will now proceed to assign e/o/u-labels to all boundary elds, not just the ones adjacent
to the boundary, in the following way: any eld adjacent to an n-type boundary will get
where both x
the label u. in this case no multiplicities do occur. in the case
and y are of i-type, the possible representations  are those that occur in the fusion of xe, ye
(which is the same set as in the fusion of xo, yo) or xe, yo (which is the same as xo, ye). if 
occurs in the xe, yefusion it gets an e-label, i.e. =e and if it occurs in the xe, yofusion an
o-label =o. if  occurs in both fusions, this representation has multiplicity two and the two
corresponding elds have labels e and o.

the eld content between dierent boundary conditions is summed up in table 1 listing
b from (11) for the dierent cases (here the representation  has kac-labels

the numbers nia
 = (r, s) and the boundary conditions a, b have labels (a, a) and (b, b)).

notice the double role of the e/o/uindices: when x is a boundary condition, then xe, xo
or xu denote the even/odd/unique eld living between the x and boundary. in particular
xe and xo denote dierent representations. if  is a representation, then e, o or u all denote
the same representation and distinguish elds with multiplicities by labelling one as even and
the other as odd.

3.4 ordering of boundary conditions

the constraint equations (4)(7) allow for a large amount of gauge freedom of the structure
constants. here we nd a particular set of structure constants and show that any solution
of the constraints can be transformed into this set by a regauging. for the construction
of the structure constants presented here an ordering of the boundary conditions has to be
introduced. let x=(, ) and y=(, ). then we dene:

x < y  ( < ) or ( =  and  < )

(17)

4 boundary structure constants

in this section we will construct a set of boundary structure constants that solve the sewing
constraint (4) under the condition that there exists a solution at all (for the given eld content).
the line of argument in this section is as follows: we assume that there exists a solution to
(4) for the d-series eld content. then we use the property of (4) that a change of basis in
the set of primary boundary elds maps a solution of (4) to a new solution. by redening the
boundary elds one by one this freedom is exploited to adjust a subset of boundary structure
constants to the values we want. this subset together with (4) then xes the value of a general
boundary structure constant. altogether the statement is that any solution can via change of
basis be brought to the form presented in the end of this section.

as input for the boundary solution we use

a) the d-series eld content obtained in section 3.3

b) the assumption that all two-point functions h (ab)

for all a, b, i that are allowed by a).

i (x) (ba)

i (y)i are nonzero, i.e. c (aba)1

ii 6=0

an interpretation of assumption b) is that a zero two-point function implies that the eld
in question does not occur in our model and hence we are looking at a eld content dierent
from what we demanded in a). this can be seen as follows: suppose c (aba)1
ii =0 for some
choice of a, b, i. consider a correlator which contains the eld (ab)
. any correlator can
i
be expressed as a sum of conformal blocks with coecients given as products of structure
constants. it is always possible to take a limit of this correlator where all bulk elds are taken
to the boundary and then all boundary elds except for (ab)
i are taken together. in the end
(x) (ba)
we are left with the two-point function h (ab)
(y)i. thus in this limit the coecient in
i
front of each conformal block contains the factor c (aba)1
ii and hence the correlator is identically
zero. therefore any correlator involving (ab)
i vanishes and this eld can as well be removed
from the model, so that we eectively have a eld content dierent from a).

i

the actual calculation of the boundary structure constants is a slightly lengthy case by
case study and is presented only for completeness. the results are summerised in section 4.5.

4.1 nonzero boundary structure constants

first we investigate the consequence of b), i.e. that all two-point functions are nonzero.
eqn. (4) can be rewritten so that the two-point structure constants cancel. to do so we
set =1 and obtain the three-point identity:

a

i

j

b

k

c

a

 c (bca)i

jk

c (aba)1

ii = c (abc)k
ij

c (aca)1
kk

applying this to the r.h.s. of (4) we get:

a

i

j

b

k

c

d



a

 x

c (bcd)q
jk

c (abd)

iq =xp,

c (abc)p
ij

c (acd)
p k

f

pq(cid:20) j k
(cid:21)

i

(18)

(19)

note that there is no freedom the rescale the identity eld 1 on any boundary. its nor-
(xxy)j
1i =i,j, and

malisation is already xed by the condition that 1 (xy)

i , i.e. that c

i = (xy)

similar for c

(xyy)j
i1

.

dene an operation  on the labels e, o, u as follows: xe=xo, xo=xe and xu=xu, i.e.
in terms of kac-labels: (r, s) = (r, q  s). take
with q=1 and
x any boundary condition. the sum on the r.h.s. of (19) reduces to p=xi because the
representations xi and o can fuse only to xi. we get:

o

o

xi

xi

(20)

the l.h.s. is nonzero due to assumption b) and hence all terms on the r.h.s. have to be nonzero
for a solution with properties a) and b).

in the same way, for an n-type boundary a and an arbitrary boundary x we can consider
xi
, again with q=1. the sum reduces to p=au and we are left with:

ku

again all terms on the r.h.s. have to be nonzero.

let a be an n-type boundary. taking



o

u

a

au



and q=au the sum

reduces to p=u and we see, using (23):

oau = c (a)au

uu

f

(25)

the representation u lives on
and the fusion u, au  u exists by construction
of the eld content. c (a)au
is nonzero (see (21)) and the f-matrix element has to be
independant of the specic choice of u we make. we denote this f-matrix element with ba:

uu



a

ba = f

uau(cid:20) o au
u  (cid:21)

comparing to (25) we see c (a)au
boundary x as follows:

oau =ba.

it is also useful to dene a constant cx for any

x of i-type: cx = f

xo xo(cid:21)

x of n-type: cx = f

from (19) with 

any n-type boundary a:

o

o



au

a

au



, q=au and p=1 we get the following identity for

ca  ba =

a
ba

(28)

let x and y be two boundaries s.t. one is of n-type. then by rescaling (xy)
u

for x6= and
=1 where ,  stand for the labels e or u, as applicable for the present
6=1 we x c
boundary conditions. let x be an i-type boundary. we can use (19) to calculate the structure
constants involving xo instead of xe:

(xy)y
xu

c (xa)au

xou

a

ba
a

f

auxo(cid:20) o xe
au  (cid:21)

(29)

using (19) and the identities in appendix b one can verify that the denitions above give
where at least one of x, y is of

rise to symmetrical structure constants, i.e. c (xy)y
xu
n-type.

= c (yx)y
ux

4.3

i-type boundaries

let x, y be i-type boundaries. consider the structure constant c (xy)y
where the labels
x
, ,  are either e or o (as u cannot occur in this situation). we will now try to regauge the
boundary elds such that the following rule holds:

the structure constant c (xy)y
x
sets {e, e, e} or {e, o, o}.

can be nonzero only if {, , } is one of the (unordered)

suppose that the representation  on

occurs with multiplicity one. recall
from the analysis of the d-series boundary eld content in section 3.3 that then the above
rule is automatically true, since e.g. if  gets label e then it occurs in the fusion of xe, ye or
xo, yo but not in the fusion of xe, yo and xo, ye.

x

y

if the representation  occurs with multiplicity two, we can use the freedom to form linear
combinations of the two elds to make the above rule true. this is explained in more detail
below.

let  be a representation that occurs with multiplicity two. let (xy)
e

elds. recall that we normalised the two-point functions in such a way that only h (xy)
and h (xy)

be the two
(yx)
e i
(yx)
o i are nonzero. when taking linear combinations of the primary elds one has
to preserve this condition, or the form of the sewing constraints would change. one gets the
following constraints:

and (xy)
o

o

e

h (xy)

e

(yx)
o i = 0

,

h (xy)

o

(yx)
e i = 0

(30)

10

now consider the following change of basis:

  (xy)
o !new

e
(xy)

= (cid:18)a b

c d(cid:19)  (xy)
o !old

e
(xy)

,   (yx)

e
(yx)

o !new

= (cid:18)a b

d(cid:19)  (yx)
o !old

e
(yx)

c

where the two matrices are invertible. the constraints (30) amount to:

ac  c (xyx)1

ee,old + b d  c (xyx)1

oo,old = 0

ca  c (xyx)1

ee,old + db  c (xyx)1

oo,old = 0

(31)

(32)

we see that we can choose the new basis of (xy) arbitrarily and the above condition xes the
direction, but not the length of the new basis vectors for (yx).

this change of basis can be used to bring the following 22matrix composed of structure

constants to diagonal form:

  c (xy)ye

c (xy)ye

xee

xeo

xee

c (xy)yo
c (xy)yo

xeo !  (cid:18) 0
0 (cid:19)

(33)

we now redened the structure constants c (xy)y
x
coupling relations {e, e, e} or {e, o, o}.

the change of basis xes the new (yx)
e

and (yx)
o

in such a way that they obey our desired

up to rescaling. however they do already

obey the odd/even-coupling relation. to see this consider (19) in the form:



xe

x

e

y

o

xe

x



, q=1

 c (xyx)1

xee

c (yx)xe

yeo

f



ye1(cid:20) 

xe xe(cid:21)

(34)

the l.h.s. of this equation is zero and on the r.h.s. both c (xy)ye
nonzero (this can be seen from evaluating c (xyx)1
ee
c (yx)xe

=0 as we said.

6=0 instead of c (xyx)1

xee

eo

and the f-matrix entry are

=0 in (34)). hence

oxo =a in the previous section we can determine c (x)xo

oxe

by using (19) and

yeko
from c (x)xe

(82):

one can verify that for =1 indeed c (xx)xo
expressions for c (x) given before.

xo1 =1 and that for x= the above reduces to the

as in the case of mixed boundaries one can now check that the denitions in (36) give rise
to reection symmetric structure constants, but this time there is an exception for x=y: in

11

this case some of the structure constants are antisymmetric under reection. as opposed to
the a-series, for the d-series it is in general impossible to nd a gauge in which all boundary
structure constants have reection symmetry. to see this consider (19) in the form:



xe

x

o

x

xe

o





 c (xx)xo

xoxe

f

(37)

eqn. (81) forces the f-matrix entry in (37) to square to one. but in general it does take the
, in general
is symmetric for some values of o, it will be antisymmetric

values 1, depending on o. so no matter how we choose c (x)o
we cannot avoid that if c (xx)xo
for others.

and c (x)o

xoxe

xexo

xeo

one can verify that (36) implies that for even elds alone we get a solution that resembles
=1, whereas the various structure constants involving odd elds are:

the a-series, i.e. c (xy)ye

xee

= 1 ; c (xy)yo

for x  y:

4.4 general boundary structure constants

consider (19) in the form

(38)

(39)

where the set {, t, } has to be one of {e, e, e}, {e, o, o} or {u,,}. since all constants that
can occur on the r.h.s. have been computed in the previous two sections, the general boundary
structure constants can be obtained from (39).

suppose all boundaries are of i-type. then choosing =e and =t reduces the sum in (39)
to =r.in the numerator on the r.h.s. we now see the boundary structure constant c (yz)zt
,
which obeys the even/odd coupling rule as seen in section 4.3. this implies that the even/odd
coupling rule extends to all boundary structure constants, i.e. c (xyz)kt
can be nonzero only if
{r, s, t} is one of the sets {e, e, e}, {e, o, o} or {u,,}.
i.e. given c (xyz)kt
is equivalent to =1 in the following equation:

we can also investigate the behaviour of the boundary structure constants under reection,
reection symmetry

? using (18) we check that for c (xy)y
x

, what is c (zyx)kt

12

as remarked in the previous two sections, using the explicit form of the structure constants
derived there, we see that =1 in all cases except for one, and that is =o and x=y, where
we can have =  1. this can be made more precise in the light of (37), if we dene:

(x, x, o) = f

xoxo(cid:20) xe o
xe(cid:21)



and

(x, y, ) = 1 in all other cases

(41)

then (40) holds with  = (x, y, i) for all x, y, i and we can use this relation to evaluate the
reection property of the general boundary structure constants obtained in (39). we get:

c (xyz)kt

irjs =

(x, y, ir)(y, z, js)

(x, z, kt)

 c (zyx)kt

jsir

(42)

4.5 collection of results

we found: any solution to the boundary four-point constraint (4) for a given d-series eld
content can be brought to the same form by regauging the elds, i.e. if there is a solution, it
is essentially unique.

k

i (yz)

j  (xz)

can exist. first the according verlinde fusion number nij

in the gauge we chose, there are two conditions that have to be satised before a given
fusion (xy)
k has to
be nonzero and second the e/u/o-labels {, , } have to be one of the sets {u,,}, {e, e, e}
or {e, o, o} (where  stands for any label). the assignment of the e/o/u-labels is described in
section 3.3. from this even/oddcoupling rule we see immediately that the boundary structure
constants involving only i-type boundaries have a z2symmetry of the form (xy)
and
o   (xy)
(xy)

there are two boundary conditions which we have endowed with a special name.  stands
for the boundary condition associated to the (1, 1) pair of nodes in the diagram (13) and 
for (1, q

2 ). the boundary structure constants take the following form:

e  (xy)

o

e

.

 two-point functions with  (the constants a and cx are dened in (24) and (27)):

c (x)1

xuxu = 1

c (x)1

xexe = 1

c (x)1

xoxo = a  cx

 for x any type and y of n-type (by is dened in (26)):
c (xy)yu

c (xy)yu

c (xy)yu

by

f

xeyu(cid:20) o yu
 (cid:21)

xo

 for x, y of i-type and xy (the ordering is dened in section 3.4):

c (xy)ye

xee

= 1

c (xy)yo

xeo

(43)

(44)

(45)

all other cases can be obtained from this list by using (40) with =1 (since the case x=y is
covered in the list), with results listed in (29), (38).

for the general boundary structure constants we distinguish two cases. first, for x, z of

n-type and y of i-type the sum over  in (39) has to be carried out and we get:

c (xyz)ku

iuju = f

yek(cid:20) xu zu

j (cid:21) +

i

bx
bz  f

xu(cid:21)f
xuyo(cid:20) ye o

yo(cid:21)f
yezu(cid:20) zu o

yok(cid:20) xu zu
j (cid:21)

j

i

i

(46)

13

in all other cases the sum reduces to one term with the result:

c (xyz)kt

irjs

=

c

(xy)y
xir

c (yz)z

yjs

c (xz)z
xkt

f

yk(cid:20) x z
j (cid:21)

i

(47)

the r.h.s. does not depend on the specic choice of , ,  as long as the combinations {, r, },
{, s, } and {, t, } are allowed by the even/odd coupling rule. the structure constant in
the denominator is then automatically nonzero (see section 4.1). the boundary structure
constants are either symmetric or antisymmetric under reection, the precise behaviour is
given in eqn. (42).

note in particular that if x, y, z are all of n-type or if the elds ir, js, kt are even, the

solution takes the same form as in the a-series (see eqn. (31) in [15]):

c (xyz)ke

ieje

= f

yek(cid:20) xe ze
j (cid:21)

i

and

c (xyz)ku

iuju

= f

yuk(cid:20) xu zu
j (cid:21)

i

(48)

in fact this form also holds for all mixed cases with only e/u eld labels, except when the
boundaries x, z are of n-type and y is of i-type, when we obtained (46).

5 extension to bulk theory

the bulk-boundary couplings (a)bi
(5) in a rewritten form using the assumption that all c (xyx)1
the model (see section 4):

k can be determined by analysing the sewing constraint
ii are nonzero for elds present in

(b)bi

 c (abb)q

xm
km(cid:20)  q
i p(cid:21)f
 f

m(cid:20) i 
p q(cid:21)

(49)

suppose now there is a boundary condition a and a bulk eld i s.t. i does not couple to
any boundary eld on the boundary a, i.e. (a)bi
a 6= 0. then, roughly
speaking (this is discussed in more detail below), since the r.h.s. of (49) is now zero, all bs
involving the bulk eld i are zero. since any n-point function has a limit in which we take
all bulk elds to the boundary, and hence in this limit the factors in front of the conformal
blocks contain the product of the bs of all bulk elds, any n-point function involving the
eld i is identically zero. this in turn just means that the bulk eld i is not part of the
model and can be left out.

k =0 for all k with nka

using this idea we can now determine the maximal bulk eld content consistent with (49).
this does not prove that the maximal eld content has to be modular invariant, but it turns
out that it is indeed the d-series bulk eld content derived in [4].

to make this more precise, the classication of boundary conditions and their eld content
in [9] establishes a onetoone correspondence between boundary conditions and diagonal bulk
elds. in this approach specifying the possible boundary conditions is equivalent to giving the
diagonal part of the bulk partition function, and from [4] one knows which o-diagonal parts
have to be added to make it modular invariant. the statement thus is that, at least of the
a and dseries, the bulk eld content obtained by this procedure is the maximal consistent
one.

for an arbitrary boundary x consider (49) with a=, b=x, p=x, q=x. the  sum reduces
to one element and we get:

(x)bi

 c (xx)x

x 

= ()bi

1 c (x)x

1x

(cid:0) fs (cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k=1

(cid:0) fs (cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k=o

+ ()bi

o c (x)x

ox

(50)

first note that from an argument similar to (20) and (21) we see that all boundary
structure constants that appear in (50) are nonzero if they are allowed by fusion and the
even/odd coupling rule (see section 4.1).

suppose a bulk eld i does not couple to the boundary, i.e. ()bi

o =0.
then the r.h.s. of (50) is identically zero and since the boundary structure constant on the
k =0 for all a,k. as we argued before this implies that
l.h.s. is nonzero it follows that (a)bi
all correlators involving i vanish and the eld can be removed from the bulk theory. hence
for any bulk eld i we need at least one of ()bi

o to be nonzero.

1 =0 and ()bi

1 and ()bi

the bulk eld i transforms in a tensor product of two representations i. suppose i is
a eld with spin, i.e. i6=. then i and  cannot fuse to the identity and hence it follows that
o 6=0. this is only possible if the fusion
1 =0. so for the eld i to exist we need ()bi
()bi
i,   o exists, i.e. only pairs with kac-labels i=(r, s) and =(r, q  s) are possible. now
consider (50) with x=, =x=o, x=1. we obtain (compare also to (16)):

()bi

o = ()bi

o  e2i(hihi) = ()bi

o  e2i( p

2r)( q

2s)

(51)

for the exponential to be +1 we need q
odd and q always even).

2  s to be even (recall that for the d-series p is always
next suppose that the bulk eld i is diagonal, i.e. i=. let i have kac-labels (r, s). as
before denote by i the representation with kac-labels (r, q  s). consider (50) with x=,
=1, x=x=o. the f-sum in (49) reduces to m=i and we obtain:

()bi

1 = ()bi

1  e2i(hi

hiho ) =  ()bi

1  eis

(52)

hence only diagonal bulk elds with representation i=(r, s) where s is odd are present. recall
that by convention r is always odd.

up to now we have determined which pairs of representations are possible in the bulk.
now we have to determine their multiplicities. the maximal multiplicity a bulk eld can
have is equal to the number of boundary elds it couples to on the boundary. this can
be seen as follows: suppose two bulk elds i, i in the same representation i can due to
the fusion rules only couple to one eld  on the boundary. then we can dene two new

bulk elds as linear combination of i, i s.t., say, ()bi
,new=0. now the
new i eld does not couple to the boundary at all and can be removed from the theory. a
similar argument forbids more than two bulk elds in the same representation that by fusion
can couple to the two elds on the boundary. the only bulk-representations that allow
coupling to both elds on the boundary is the pair ii where i has kac-labels (r, q
2 ) and
only in this case multiplicity two can occur.

,new6=0 and ()bi



table 2 summarizes the maximal bulk eld content consistent with a d-type cylinder
partition function. each representation in the table occurs once for each possible fusion. the
only situation in which multiplicity arises is for pairs of representations that can fuse to both
1 and o, in which case we have multiplicity two. note that as mentioned before this can only

note that the same line of argument also works for the a-series. here the situation is
much simpler, since there is only one eld, i.e. the identity, on the 1boundary. hence only
diagonal bulk elds are allowed and only multiplicity one can occur. this is precisely the
a-series modular invariant bulk eld content.

5.2 bulk-boundary couplings

as a rst step to determine the bulk-boundary couplings we will choose a basis of primary
bulk elds s.t. each eld couples either to 1 or to o on the boundary, but not to both
simultaneously.

as we have seen in the previous section, this demand is automatically enforced by the
fusion rules except for diagonal bulk elds in the representation ii where i has kac-labels
(r, q
2 ) and we are looking at a deven model. in this case the corresponding bulk elds have
multiplicity two and similar to the argument for redening the boundary structure constants
in section 4.3 we can take linear combinations of the two bulk elds to obtain the desired
coupling rule. we will denote bulk elds that couple to 1 on the boundary as even and
bulk elds that couple to the boundary eld o as odd. the new bulkboundary couplings
then fulll ()bie

o =0 for the even bulk elds ie and ()bio

1 =0 for the odd elds io.

we are still free to rescale all the bulk elds i. we use this freedom to set (the odd
1 represent the pasquier algebra as

diagonal elds are normalised dierently so that the (x)bi
seen in section 5.6):

for all other cases

1 = ()bie

o = 0

from the coupling rule

(53)

with this redenition of the elds the sum on the r.h.s. of (50) reduces to one term. using

(50) with = and k= the general bulkboundary coupling takes the form:

(x)bi

 = ()bi

 xm

exp(cid:0)i(2hm  2hi  hx  hx + 1
m(cid:20)  x
i x(cid:21)f

: =e and =e or u
: =o and =o
: =o and =u
: otherwise

(54)

where =e if x is an i-type boundary and =u if x is an n-type boundary.




16

note in particular that any bulk eld can couple to a ueld on an n-type boundary, but
for an i-type boundary an even bulk eld can only couple to an even boundary eld and an
odd bulk eld to an odd boundary eld. this indicates that the z2symmetry of the boundary
structure constants for i-type boundaries carries over to the bulk.

5.3 bulk structure constants

the bulk structure constants can now be obtained from (6). take a=, the sum on the l.h.s.
k 6=0, i.e. k=. on the r.h.s. the sum over p and q
then reduces to the term where ()bm
reduces to p=, q=. the rsum is also reduced to one element. we are left with:

cij

()bi

m = exp(cid:0)i 

 ()bj
()bm





2 (h +hh +2(hjhr)+hmhmhi+hihj+hj)(cid:1)

m(cid:20)  r
i j(cid:21)f

r m(cid:20) 





(55)

where r=j if =e and r=j if =o. the rst f-matrix element in (55) implements an even/odd
coupling rule for bulk elds, i.e. the only combinations for {, , } which can be nonzero are
{e, e, e} and {e, o, o}.
this implies that apart from other symmetries the bulk structure constants may have
there is a manifest z2symmetry which sends even bulk elds to themselves and odd one to
minus themselves. together with section 4.5 and eqn. (54) we can now conclude that any
correlator with no or only i-type boundaries is manifestly invariant under the z2symmetry
e  e and o  o applied to bulk and boundary simultaneously.
from the explicit expression in (55) we get:

it is useful to know the bulk two-point functions in the present normalisation of elds.

where s(i) = hihi  z is the spin of the bulk eld i.
in [14] it was shown that the minimal model bulk structure constants in the a and d
series are related by rational numbers, called relative structure constants. taking the explicit
expression (55) together with the normalisation (56) we nd (numerical) agreement with these
results. also, for unitary models the signs of the two-point structure constants in (56) are
the same as in [14], where they were shown to lead to real bulk structure constants (in the
unitary case).

note that if all bulk elds are even the solution (55) takes the same form as in the a-series:

cieje

me =(cid:18)f

m1(cid:20) i

i

j j(cid:21)(cid:19)1

(57)

together with equations (48) for the boundary structure constants and (54) for the bulk-
boundary couplings this illustrates another interesting point. if one considers the even elds
alone, that is all bulk and boundary elds that are invariant under the z2symmetry men-
tioned above, they form a subalgebra (as the coupling e, e  o is not allowed) and the structure
constants are identical to the a-series in the following way:

17

consider the a-series boundary theory associated to the pair of diagrams (ap1, aq1). in
this theory consider only the boundary conditions (, ) with  < p
2 and
 > q
2 (compare to (15)) and the bulk elds ii where i has kac-labels (r, s) with both r and
s odd. then this is a closed subset of elds of the a-series theory and in the normalisation
chosen its structure constants coincide with those of the invariant elds of the d-series theory
2 +1). this correspondence seems natural form the point of view that the invariant
(ap1, d q
part of the d-diagram is an a-diagram.

2 and  < q

2 or  > p

5.4 real structure constants

in the normalisation chosen in this paper the f-matrices are all real. this implies rst of all
that the boundary structure constants as given in section 4.5 are all real.

for the bulk structure constants we have seen in (57) that they are real as long as only
me . the phase
even elds are involved. if odd elds are present consider (55) in the case ciojo
factors cancel and we are left with a real expression. all other cases are real as well, as can for
1 together with
example be seen from the three-point function cij
the fact that all two-point structure constants (56) are real. thus in the present normalisation
all bulk structure constants are real, both for unitary and non-unitary models.

1 = cjk

k ckk

i cii

for the bulk-boundary couplings in (54) we can apply the identity (86) to obtain the

result:

(cid:16) (x)b(i)

(cid:17) = (x)b(i)



(58)

this means that complex conjugation relates the bulk-boundary coupling for a bulk eld of
spin s to that of the eld of spin s. in particular all bulk-boundary couplings for diagonal
bulk elds are real.
it is in general not possible to choose a basis of primary elds s.t. all structure constants
are real. to see this we construct a gauge invariant expression from the sewing constraints
which cannot be fullled by real structure constants. consider for example two diagonal bulk
elds i and m and a eld j with spin one. take (6) with k=1 and a=. this forces
p=q=o and r = . we get:

o 6=0) and we
as discussed in section 5.1 the spin one eld j has to couple to o (i.e. ()bj
can nd a diagonal eld i that couples to o. the boundary two-point function has to
be nonzero by assumption b) in section 4. hence the r.h.s. is nonzero and thus some of
the d-series structure constants will have nonzero imaginary part if they solve the sewing
constraints.

we can however consider the following non-primary basis of bulk elds to obtain real
structure constants: diagonal (even or odd) bulk elds stay as they are and for a pair s, s
of nondiagonal bulk elds with spins s we dene a new set of elds as follows:

r = 1

2 (s + s)

i = 1

2i (s  s)

(60)

the new elds r and i are no longer primary, but one nds that the coecients describing
their behaviour under arbitrary conformal mappings are all real. since the ope is determined

18

from the transformation behaviour of the elds one expects the coecients appearing in the
ope to be real as well.

one can see explicitly from (58) that all bulk-boundary couplings (x)br

 are
real and one can verify numerically that all bulk structure constants are real in the new basis
as well. this holds for both unitary and non-unitary models.

 and (x)bi

5.5 discrete symmetries of the structure constants

denote the set of bulk and boundary structure constants given in (43)(47) and (53)(55)
with a. we see that a depends explicitly on the assignment of e/olabels in section 3.3 and
the ordering of the boundary conditions in section 3.4.

denote the set of structure constants obtained by the same procedure, but with a dierent
initial assignment of e/olabels in section 3.3 as b. it was shown in this paper that any solution
to the sewing constraints with the d-series eld content can be brought to the form a. in
particular there is a change of basis in the set of primary elds that maps b to a.

for the primary elds in a we considered a z2action that takes even elds to themselves
and odd elds to minus themselves. this action leaves the structure constants involving no
or only i-type boundaries invariant.

however a dierent initial e/olabelling leads to a dierent action of z2 on the boundary
elds. the z2action of b does via the change of basis induce a z2action on a which
is dierent from the original one. it follows that each distinct e/oassignment results in a
distinct z2action on a.

going back to section 3.3 we see that for each i-type boundary x6= we are free to choose
x we call xe and which xo. the specic assignment

which of the two elds living on 
made in section 3.3 was motivated on physical grounds.

there are altogether n =2(p1)(q2)/41 distinct assignments. thus among other symme-
tries the structure constants may have, there are n z2s acting on the set of primary elds
that leave the subset of the structure constants in a that involve no or only i-type boundary
conditions invariant. one can convince oneself that the z2s all act in the same way on the
bulk elds but can be distinguished from their action on the boundary elds. the collection
of z2s just presented does not necessarily exhaust all discrete symmetries as can be seen for
example in the three-states potts model which has an additional z3symmetry of whose z2
subgroups only one is contained in the above list.

5.6 disc partition function and pasquier algebra

up two now all constraints on the structure constants were derived in such a way that the
uhp cancelled. we will next derive some constraints for the
(yx)
i i

vacuum expectation values h1i(x)
vacuum expectation values of the unit disc h1i(x)

d . consider the two-point function h (xy)

on the unit disc. taking dierent limits leads to the constraint:

i

d = c (yxy)1

ii h1i(x)
c (xyx)1
d , h1i(y)

ii h1i(y)

d

(61)

the vacuum expectation values h1i(x)

d can be interpreted as the partition function of
the unit disc with dierent boundary conditions. this expression thus relates the partition
functions of dierent boundary conditions in the same geometry. the relation (61) remains
true for dierent (genus zero) geometries, but the actual values of the partition functions do
depend on the shape of the system (see e.g. [20]). for example the partition function for a

disc of radius r is given by h1i(x)

d  rc/6, where c is the central charge [20].

19

substituting the explicit boundary two-point functions into (61) we arrive at the following

expressions (let x, y be i-type boundaries and a, b be n-type boundaries):

where the sum runs over all (even or odd) diagonal bulk elds and the vectors x form a

using (56) and normalising the bulk vacuum:

from the relations (67), (68) and (62) together with the constraint that the vectors x

form an orthonormal basis we get the following expression:

x,i = (x)bi

since the bulk-boundary couplings are known from (54) one can now check that the s so
y on the l.h.s. taken
dened are all real and verify numerically that they fulll (63), with nix
from section 3.3.

6 conclusion

the aim of this paper was to nd all structure constants of the d-series minimal model
boundary conformal eld theory and to point out some of their properties.

the structure constants can be calculated in several steps. the basic ingredient are the
fusion matrices, as all structure constants are expressed in terms of these. a procedure to
obtain the fusion matrices recursively is given in [15], together with references to the original
literature. the matrices can also be extracted by rescaling explicit expressions found e.g.
in [17] to match the normalisation xed in appendix a. as a rst step the d-series eld content
of the boundary theory is computed, as described in section 3.3. next all boundary structure
constants are obtained from the results collected in section 4.5. the boundary theory is now
fully determined. the extension from the boundary to the bulk recovers the familiar d-series
bulk eld content as the maximal set of bulk elds consistent with the boundary theory (see
section 5.1). last, the remaining two sets of structure constants, the bulk-boundary couplings
and the bulk structure constants are given in (53), (54) and (55).

the boundary structure constants c (xyz)t

tained by this procedure are all real, both for unitary and non-unitary minimal models.
 are imaginary. there is in general no
however some of the bulk-boundary couplings (x)bi
basis of primary elds such that all structure constants real. in section 5.4 a non-primary
basis of elds was presented in which all three sets of structure constants are real.

and the bulk structure constants cij

the solution described above was obtained by deriving a necessary form of the structure
constants. it was shown that any solution to the sewing constraints (4)(7) for the d-series
eld content can be brought to this form. so just as for the a-series it follows that the
structure constants are unique up to redenition of the elds. it was however not analytically
shown that the given structure constants do indeed solve the full set of genus zero sewing
constraints, since they are overdetermined and only a subset was used for the actual solution.
but numerical tests carried out for several minimal models where each of the equations (4)(7)
was checked repeatedly with a dierent random selection of elds show no contradiction.

it was also found that a subset of the d-series structure constants have a manifest z2
symmetry: if no or only i-type boundaries are present in a correlator it is invariant under
the change eveneven and odd odd. this symmetry can be associated to the z2
symmetry of the d-diagram in the sense that the boundary conditions fall in two classes: the
i-type boundaries are associated to nodes left invariant by that symmetry, and the n-type
boundaries to nodes which are not. we have also seen that the even elds alone form a closed
subalgebra with structure constants equal to the corresponding ones of an a-type theory.

in deriving the structure constants we have used only the virasoro algebra, and not consid-
ered the fact that it could be part of a larger symmetry algebra, as is the case for deven models.
from the present point of view, curious properties of the solution such as the boundary eld
content, the even/odd coupling rule or numerical coincidences in the structure constants, are
obtained as results of the calculation, but lack an explanation in terms of the additional struc-
ture present in the theory. one can use the maximally extended chiral algebra as a starting
point for the analysis of a boundary conformal eld theory (see e.g. [22] and references therein)
and it would be interesting to interpret the explicit results presented here in this more general
framework.

in section 5.5 it was pointed out that an initial freedom in the labelling of the boundary
elds actually implies that the just mentioned z2 is part of a collection of 2(p1)(q2)/41
z2s, each acting in a distinct way on the set of primary boundary elds. this action leaves
structure constants with no or only i-type boundaries invariant.

21

finally the vacuum expectation values h1i(x)

d of the unit disc with dierent boundary con-
ditions were computed and it was pointed out that in the present normalisation the bulk-
boundary couplings (x)bi

1 form one-dimensional representations of the pasquier algebra.

to make contact with dierent conventions in the literature the bulk and boundary elds
may have to be redened. the normalisations chosen in this paper can be obtained from (56)
in terms of the bulk two-point functions, or from (53) in terms of the bulk-boundary couplings
to the identity eld on the boundary.

appendix a: derivation of the ve-point constraint

this appendix was included to illustrate how the notation and techniques for calculating with
conformal blocks described in [11] were used to rederive the sewing constraints in [10].

the sewing constraints arise from taking two dierent limits in a given correlator where
the elds approach each other or the boundary and demanding that the two sets of structure
constants and conformal blocks give rise to the same function.

conformal blocks associated to dierent asymptotic regimes can be transformed into each

other using the fusion or fmatrices. the fmatrices are dened as follows:

i

j

p

k



(z)

(w)

=xq

f

(cid:21) i

j

k

q

(z  w)


(w)

the conformal blocks appearing in (71) solve the linear dierential equations associated with
the (chiral) correlator hi|j(z)k(w)|li.

the example we consider is the derivation of the constraint resulting from taking dierent
on the

limits in the correlator involving two bulk elds i, j and one boundary eld (aa)
k
upper half plane with the boundary condition labelled a.

in the rst limit we take the two bulk elds to the boundary and are left with a three-point
function on the boundary. in the second limit we start by taking the ope of the two bulk

22

elds and then take the remaining bulk eld to the boundary. let z=xz+iyz and w=xw+iyw.
the asymptotic behaviour in the two limiting cases is then given by:

on the other hand the correlator can be expressed as a linear combination of conformal
blocks. we use two sets of conformal blocks to express the correlator in two dierent ways,
one associated to each asymptotic behaviour in (73). we obtain the following two linear
combinations:

hi(z, z)j (w, w) (aa)

taking the limits calculated in (73) for the exact expressions in terms of conformal blocks
(74) relates the coecients cp,q and dm, m to the products of structure constants obtained by
applying the ope. the precise relation is:

cp,q  ei

2 (hkhmhm) =x

(75)

the phase factors originate from relating z  z = 2iyz to 2yz etc. the sums over ,  and  in
(75) take care of elds with multiplicities. fields that transform in the same representation
of the virasoro algebra show the same asymptotic behaviour and cannot be discriminated by
conformal blocks. hence their structure constants occur as a sum in front of the according
conformal block.

23

the two sets of conformal blocks in (74) are related by a basis transformation. this
transformation can be carried out in several steps making use of two basic moves of braiding
and fusion implemented by the b and f matrix (see [11] for details). one possible way to
perform the basis transformation is as follows:
