1. apart from being a universal way of looking at gravity/gauge theory relation, mal-
dacenas supergravity(sugra)/super yang-mills(sym) duality [1, 2] provides a useful
tool for the study of strongly coupled gauge theories.1 the precise rules for relating
sugra and sym observables in the context of ads5/cft4 duality of ref.[1] were given
in refs.[4, 5]. they consist of (a) the dictionary between gauge-invariant sym opera-
tors and sugra elds, and (b) the precise relation between the generating functional
of correlators of n = 4 cft4 and the type iib sugra action s(i) evaluated on the
solutions i of the classical equations satisfying the boundary conditions i|ads  i
0,
where i

0 are the sources for the operators of cft4.

the rules a and b were used for the calculation of two, three and four point functions
of strongly coupled conformal n = 4 sym in a number of papers refs.[411]. given that
in the conformal case one can use sugra/sym duality to calculate correlation functions
of sym4, one naturally wonders if the rules a and b can be modied to incorporate sym4
on the coulomb branch. the ads5/sym4 correspondence on the coulomb branch was
rst discussed in ref.[1], where the relevance of multi-center d3-brane sugra solution
to sugra/sym4 duality was rst mentioned. various aspects of this correspondence
have since been discussed in ref.[12], but it stood on a much weaker grounds compared
to the correspondence in the conformal case. recently, klebanov and witten [13] gave
arguments, partly based on an earlier work ref.[14], in favor of ads/sym correspondence
on the coulomb branch.

let us recall a generalization of rule b proposed in ref.[14]. there it was pointed out
that (s())
0(x) = ho(x)i0 is the expectation value of the operator o(x) in the presence of
the boundary source 0. in the context of eq. (1), the bulk solution  to the classical
eld equations is completely determined by the boundary value 0 and the requirement
of regularity in the bulk. this uniqueness fails if one admits singular elds corresponding
to sources in the bulk. the generalization of eq. (1) proposed in ref.[14] consists in
introducing sources in the bulk. the sym one-point function htrf 2(x)i in the instanton
background was computed in ref.[14] by considering the response of bulk sugra action
in d-instanton background to the change in boundary data. in the same sense as the
relevant sugra background to consider in the case of sym in the instanton background
is ads d-instanton background, multi-center d3-brane background is relevant in the case
of sym on the coulomb branch [13].

2. in the present work we will extend the rules a and b to the case of sym4 with the
higgs vev x turned on, and apply the modied rules to a specic case of spherically
symmetric distribution of eigenvalues of x. let oi = oi[f, x] be gauge invariant sym

consider the 10d type iib sugra action s10(i) in the multi-center d3-brane back-

ground:

where  is the distribution function of d3-branes normalized as r d6y(~y) = n and q is

the charge of a single d3-brane. now substitute the expansions of the elds i in spherical
harmonics

i(x, ~y) = x i

into s10(i) and integrate over the sphere s5. we end up with a ve dimensional action
i ) in some eective background which is asymptotically ads5.2 in the single-
s5 = s5(i
center d3-brane case s5 coincides with the ve dimensional gauged sugra action on
ads5 background with the innite tower of kaluza-klein elds included. in the conformal
case the rule a was formulated by matching the spectrum of sugra elds on the ads5
s5 background [15] with the conformal dimensions of sym [5]. a natural extension of
rule a to our case consists in matching the spectrum of sugra elds in the infrared
with the dimensions of the sym operators in the ultraviolet. the modication of rule b
reads as follows

(cid:28)expzr4

0 oii(cid:29) x

= exp(s5(i

(5)

since asymptotically the geometry is ads5, we impose the same boundary conditions for
the bulk sugra elds i

i as in the conformal case.

3. let us apply the modied rules to the computation of the two-point functions of the
operators tr(f 2x i), where x i = x i1x i2    x ilci
i1i2il [10]. these operators correspond
to the kaluza-klein harmonics i of the 10d dilaton. let us consider the dilaton kinetic

2in general there will be no consistent truncation of s5 to lowest kk modes i=0

. there is actually
no fundamental reason for the existence of such a truncation in the generic case. the large n properties
of sym4 are encoded in 10d type iib sugra on appropriate backgrounds and not in 5d truncations
thereof.

where  = i=0 and v5 = r d5. the form of the action eq. (6) suggests that the
correlation function htrf 2tr(f 2x i)i x is non-vanishing for generic higgs vev x. however,
in the spherically symmetric case  = (|~y|) the coupling between  and i vanishes,
implying that this correlator vanishes.

let us show how this happens in sym. the distribution of d3-branes in sugra
corresponds to the distribution of higgs vev x i in sym. the general form of the correlator
htr(f 2x i)(x)tr(f 2x j )(y)i x compatible with gauge and r symmetries is

+ f2(cid:16)|x  y|, tr( x j xj ), tr x jtr xj(cid:17) tr x itr x j ,

where f1 and f2 are some arbitrary functions. in the spherically symmetric case only the
rst term survives and it is proportional to ij , in agreement with sugra.

let us consider the most general nite, spherically symmetric distribution of d3

branes. from eq. (3) we see that the harmonic function becomes

h(~y) = ( f (|y|)

.

as we argued in eq. (6), in this case the kk harmonics are decoupled. in consequence,
we can study them separately. the equations of motion for an arbitrary mode i in this
backgrond are:

where q(i) = l(l + 4) is the eigenvalue asociated to spherical harmonics y i. let  and
 be the two solutions of the equation for r  r0 and assume that  is well behaved at
zero while  is well behaved at innity. then, matching the solutions of eq. (9) at r = r0
we have for the solutions in the interval r  [0,):

where  is the wick rotated solution of the wave equation for r  r0 which is well-
behaved at r = 0. the rst term in eq. (23) cancels against a similar term coming from
the conformal piece of the two-point function (rst term in eq. (21)). at this point we
can read of the singularity structure of the two-point function (see figures 1 and 2). the
poles are given by the solutions of the equation

(, i)(2ji+2 ())   (, i)(2ji+2 ())(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=1

the solutions of eq. (24) which are rst order zeroes correspond to states in sym which
are color singlets, have the right quantum numbers to couple to oi = tr(f 2x i) and have
masses of the order
. in the large n limit these states are stable. however, for
nite n they become unstable against decay into photons. the strength of the coupling
can be read from the two-point function.

the same set of states can be obtained in the approach of ref.[16]. one starts with the
wave equation for the mode i and solves it as an eigenvalue equation subject to suitable
boundary conditions required by normalizability. in our case, the solutions are those given
in eq. (10) and eq. (11). imposing normalizability of the solution at r = 0 singles out
the solution in eq. (11), while normalizability at innity implies that the coecient of

2kl+2() (the denominator of i()) is zero. this is the wick-rotated form of eq. (24)
giving therefore the same spectrum.

for the uniform distribution discussed before, a plot of the wick-rotated function 

for l = 0 looks as in figure 2.

using the explicit solution of the wave equations and/or numerics, one can show that
all the poles are simple poles and thus correspond to physical states. numerical analysis
shows that the poles move towards higher masses as one increases i. similar behaviour
arises for the spherical shell distribution.

5. one may wonder whether the poles of the two-point function we found are artifacts
of continuous distribution of d3 branes. it would be very interesting to compute some
two-point functions for the case of the sym with the gauge group u(2n) broken to
u(n)  u(n) using the two-center d3 brane solution. for this purpose one has to solve
10d wave equation following from the 10d action eq. (6) on the two-center d3 brane
background. we expect that the two-point functions will have poles in this case as well.

note added

as this work was being completed, there appeared refs.[17, 18] which discuss some
other distributions of d3 branes and give conceptually dierent interpretation of ads/sym
correspondence on the coulomb branch. in ref.[17] the extreme smallness of masses at the
poles of the two-point functions was interpreted as an artifact of sugra approximation.
the argument was based on the fact that the curvatures of the geometries which were
considered become large close to the brane distribution and therefore, at low energies,
supergravity is not reliable. our uniformly distributed branes solution does not share
this feature, but we still nd masses of the same order of magnitude, suggesting that the
unnatural smallness of masses is not an artifact of sugra approximation.
