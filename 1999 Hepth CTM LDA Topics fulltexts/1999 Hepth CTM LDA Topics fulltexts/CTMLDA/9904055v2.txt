abstract

a tentative proposal is demonstrated that there is a natural strat-
egy to get rid of unphysical (uv) innities in qfts if one adopts
the modern standard point of view that a fundamental theory that
is complete and well-dened in all respects underlies the qfts. this
strategy works in principle for any interaction model and space-time
dimension. the importance of the procedure for dening the ambi-
guities (corresponding to the choice of the renormalization conditions
in the conventional program) is highlighted. the underlying theory
in fact stipulates the low energy and eective ones through these
denitions. some simple but important nonperturbative examples are
discussed to show the power and plausibility of the new approach.
other related issues are briey touched.

1 introduction

now, it has become a standard point of view that a fundamental theory (well
dened for the extremely high energy end) underlies the present qfts that
are in fact low energy (le) eective theories for the phenomena in le ranges
[1]. but as far as the author knows, we are still lacking a formulation that
can yield nite results in a natural way that fully makes use of the standard
point of view. a new strategy is proposed in ref. [2] that indicates the power
of the standard point of view if one uses it appropriately. as will be seen in
the following, this strategy or approach is rather simple and does not depend
on model specics and space-time dimension. to be more conservative, we
emphasize here that this is only a tentative step toward a new treatment of
the divergence problem (aiming at appreciating more physical reasons behind
the divergence) rather than a claim of a totally satisfatory new method. or,
we just suggest here another strategy in addition to the conventional ones to
deal with the unphysical innities.

let us elaborate on the standard point of view as a natural postulate or
argument: suppose, the true complete theory underlying the present qfts
is found, it must have included certain new parameters dominant in the ex-
all the
tremely high energy end to make the theory well dened there.
objects not well dened in the present qfts should become well dened in
the underlying theory and after certain limit operation about its fundamental
parameters performed on them as we are presently in a low energy phase).
our present formulation of qfts are just some kind of reformulations or
reorganizations of the le sectors of the underlying theory via the present
quantization procedures without the information about the uv underlying
world and are therefore probably ill-dened ones).

to focus on the uv problem, we will assume from now on that there
were no unphysical ir singularity in the le models in our discussions or
we have already had an ir regular formulation for the le qfts. (we will
discuss in our future works about the ir structures contribution to the whole
formulationit should be included to arrive at a totally satisfying formulation,
especially for qcd-like theories where the ir singularity is rather severe and
aects the theories predictions [3]).

it is convenient to employ a generating functional formalism [4] or a path
integral formalism to assemble the green functions for the le sectors of the
underlying theory. it is natural to expect that generally the well-dened path

2

integral for an eective sector should inevitably take the following form,

z{}({j i}) = z d(i

{}) exp{is(i

{}; {ji}; {})}

(1)

where {} are the underlying fundamental parameters (some fundamental
constants probably including the newtonian gravitation constant) from the
underlying theory and {j i} are the external sources specifying the le phe-
nomenon. the elementary elds (i
{}) in the le sectors are here appended
by the underlying parameters to indicate that they are in fact eective ones.
it is easy to see that for dierent le phenomenological physics, the le limit
operation may act upon sets of underlying parameters that dier in part.

within the path integral formalism, we can easily see that in le limit

(denoted by l{})

z 0({j i};   )  l{}(cid:26)z d(i

{}) exp{is(i
6= z d(i) exp{is(i; {ji})},

{}; {ji}; {})}(cid:27)

(2)

(3)

where the symbols not appended by the underlying parameters refer to the
constants and eld parameters given by the present qfts (i.e., the le limit
has been applied on these eective quantities or objects). thus, generally
speaking, we can not let the operation of the le limit cross the summation
over the paths or the intermediate states.
in other words, the le limit
operation and the summation over intermediate states do not commute,

  [l{}, x{paths}

] 6= 0.

(4)

if one just forces the limit operation to cross the intermediate states sum-
mation, the resulting formulations could not be valid or exist and must be
replaced by regularized versions that introduces deformations (articial sub-
stitutes for the underlying strucutres). when one tries to remove these un-
justied deformations, divergences may appear and subtraction is needed.
this is our opinion about the appearance of the unphysical innities in some
conventional qft formulations. note that our observation here is general
and valid for both perturbative frameworks and nonperturbative ones.
in
fact it is true for any quantum theory where ill-dened intermediate states
summation is inherent.

3

in the path integral formalism one can again think in terms of hamilto-
nian or lagrangian which is more familiar to physicists. then it is immediate
to see that the spectra given by the conventional hamiltonian models dier
from true ones given by the underlying theory, especially in the uv regions.
and the deviation is in a sense measured by the ill-denedness or uv diver-
gence in the conventional qfts. more severe uv divergence implies more
severe deviation, as can be seen from the fact that the unrenormalizable
models (with more severe divergence) are in fact suitable for much narrower
energy ranges. the underlying theory picture suggests that the eective
elds (or modes) will break up when energy goes up, in the meantime new
and more elementary eld or modes become active. of course some of the
elds or modes might persist over all high energy ranges, which means that
they were elementary modes in the underlying theory (cosmic fossils of the
big bang?). anyway, the true spectral manifolds for the le phenomena are
not the simple ones given by the presently known hamiltonians.

what we are trying to present in the following is that if one starts merely
with the existence of the underlying theory and {} (without knowing the
details), there is a simple strategy one can adopt to calculate the amplitudes
wanted without introducing any ad hoc regularization or cuto that leads
to uv divergence. but, due to the lacking of the true underlying struc-
tures, there must remain in our approach certain ambiguities signalling the
missing of the underlying structures, which are to be xed in principle by
phenomenology and experiments.

this paper is organized in the following way: we will rst exemplify our
strategy in feynman graph language for the one-loop case in section ii. the
treatment of the multi-loop cases is given in section iii where many conven-
tional subtleties like overlapping divergence and shifting of integral momenta
are shown to be easily resolved. some general issues associated with the
whole structures of qfts are discussed there. then we discuss some non-
perturbative examples in section iv to support our arguments. section v is
the last section where we briey discuss some related issues and summarize
our presentation. we should note in advance that here we do not aim at a
satisfactory, systematic and nal presentation of a new approach but tenta-
tively start to propose an alternative to the conventional methods with the
basic ideas sketched in some exemplary cases to interest the community of
theoretical physicists. further development and improvement and concrete
calculations following this strategy will be presented later.

2 how can uv finite results be derived

from our discussion in section i, we see that the hamiltonians (and hence the
propagators and vertices) in their present forms are the le limits of the ones
characterized by {}. to interest most readers we will exemplify our strategy
in the perturbative feynman graph language (we remind that our strategy is
denitely not conned to the perturbative case and we will exhibit the use of
the strategy in some nonperturbative cases in section iv). thus, according to
our postulate, the ill-dened (or divergent) feynman amplitudes (fas) given
by the present formulation of qfts are due to illegitimate operation order
of the le limit operation and the internal momenta integration on the corre-
sponding amplitudes from the underlying theory. in formula, similar to the
eqs. (2) and (3), if the integrand f ({qi}, {pj}, {mk}) (of an ill-dened fa)
corresponds to the integrand f ({qi}, {pj}, {mk}; {l}) from the underlying
theory with {qi}, {pj}, {mk}, {l} being respectively loop momenta, external
momenta, masses and the fundamental parameters in the underlying theory,
then

0

({pj}, {mk}) = l{}({pj}, {mk}; {l})
dnqi f ({qi}, {pj}, {mk}; {l})

dnqil{}

f({qi}, {pj}, {mk}; {l})

= l{}z yi
6= z yi
= z yi

dnqif ({qi}, {pj}, {mk}),

(5)

where 0 and  are well-dened (nite) and n refers to space-time dimension.
that means, the commutator

{} = "l{},z yi

dnqi#

(6)

only vanishes identically for convergent (i.e., well-dened) fas, otherwise we
encounter divergence or ill-denedness in fas. that is to say, the deviation
of the eective formalism is not detected by the convergent fas, or these am-
plitudes can be well described by the le limit forms of the eective theories.
this is an extremely important fact for our purpose in the following.

5

as the underlying theory or the amplitudes f (...; {l}) are unavailable
by now, we have to nd a way to approach the truththe 0({pj}, {mk})s
from our present partial knowledge about the le sectors of the underlying
quantum theory the present form of the hamiltonians or lagrangians as le
limits of the eective features of the underlying theory.

here is our strategy for extracting nite results out of eective formula-
tions of qft: (1) first we try to perform certain legitimate operations (say,
) on the objects so that the le limit operation commutes with the summa-
tion on the resulting objects if they do not commute on the original objects.
(2) then we can nish the intermediate states summation which become well
dened on the resulting objects in the present qfts. (3) at last, we perform
the inverse operations (say, 1, which should also be legitimate) to go back
and the nal expressions should be (uv) nite by construction but probably
ambiguous at the meantime due to our lack of knowledge about the underly-
ing structures. the ambiguities should be xed from the phenomenological
and experimental inputs as mentioned above. the operations (s) and their
inverse are of the main concern in our strategy and they would often be op-
erations with repect to the parameters external to the intermediate states
since the objects of interests are expressed in terms of these parameters after
all.

the more general framework eecting the natural strategy proposed here
will be the subject of our future investigations. here, we only show how
the strategy works in a simple way for the feynman graph approach, i.e.,
we exemplify our simple strategy in the feynman graph language. first we
show that the following important relation holds for 1-loop case ill-dened
fas (c.f. eq.(5) for 1-loop case)

z dnq(cid:16)pj(cid:17)

f (q, {pj}, {mk}) = (cid:16)pj(cid:17)

0({pj}, {mk}),

(7)

with 1 being the usual supercial divergence degree ofr dnqf (q, {pj}, {mk})
so that the lhs of eq.(7) exists (nite), (cid:16)pj(cid:17)

denoting dierenormalization-
tiations wrt the external parameters {pj}s of the amplitude and 0(...) is
the le limit of the amplitude calculated in the underlying theory (i.e., the
internal momentum integration is performed rst). it is easy to see that the

operation (cid:16)pj(cid:17)

leads to convergent graphs or objects.

6

l{}

f (q, {pj}, {mk}; {l})

0({pj}, {mk}).

(8)

the proof is very simple, since

dnq(cid:16)pj(cid:17)

f (q, {pj}, {mk}) = z dnq(cid:16)pj(cid:17)

r
= z dnql{}(cid:16)pj(cid:17) f(q, {pj}, {mk}; {l})
= l{}z dnq(cid:16)pj(cid:17) f (q, {pj}, {mk}; {l})
({pj}, {mk}; {l}) = (cid:16)pj(cid:17)
= l{}(cid:16)pj(cid:17)
operations (cid:16)pj(cid:17)
is due to the existence of r dnq(cid:16)pj(cid:17)
from the existence of r dnq f (q, ...; {l})(= (...; {l})).

the second and the fth steps follow from the commutativity of the two
and l{} as they act on dierent arguments, the third step

f (q, ...) and the fourth is justied

it is clear that here the dierentiation with repect to the external mo-
menta and its inverseindenite integration with respect to the same mo-
menta play the role of the certain operations mentioned above.

the right end of eq.(7) can be found now as the left end exists as a
nonpolynomial (nonlocal) function of external momenta and masses, i.e.,
denoting it as 0

(),

(cid:16)pj(cid:17)

0({pj}, {mk}) = 0

()({pj}, {mk}).

(9)

to nd 0({pj}, {mk}), we integrate both sides of eq.(9) wrt the external
momenta  times indenitely to arrive at the following expressions

(cid:18)zp(cid:19)

h(p)0({pj}, {mk})i = 0({pj}, {mk}) + n ({pj}, {c})

= npl({pj}, {mk}) + n ({pj}, {c})

(10)

with {c} and {c} being arbitrary constant coecients of an   1 order
polynomial in external momenta n  and npl({pj}, {mk}) being a denite
nonpolynomial function of momenta and masses [5]. evidently 0({pj}, {mk})
is not uniquely determined within conventional qfts at this stage. that the
true expression

0({pj}, {mk}) = npl({pj}, {mk}) + n ({pj}, {c}),

c = c  c (11)

7

contains a denite polynomial part (unknown yet) implies that it should
have come from the le limit operation on ({pj}, {mk}; {l}) (see eq.(5))
as the usual convolution integration can not yield a polynomial partalso an
indication of the incompleteness of the formalism of the qfts.

we can take the above procedures as eorts for rectifying the ill-dened
fas and represent the fas with the expressions like the rhs of eq.(10),
i.e.,

z dnqf (q, {pj}, {mk}) >=< npl({pj}, {mk}) + n ({pj}, {c})

(12)

with >=< indicating that lhs is rectied as rhs [5]. that the ambiguities
reside only in the local part means that the qfts are quite eective in the
le limit.

to nd the {c}s in eq.(11) we need inputs from the physical prop-
erties of the system (such as symmetries, invariances and unitarity) and a
complete set of data from experiments [6, 7] (if we can derive them from
the underlying theory all these requirements would be automatically ful-
lled). in other words, all the ambiguities should be xed according to this
principle. note that this is a principle independent of interaction models
and space-time dimensions, i.e., we can calculate the quantum corrections in
any model provided the denitions can be consistently and eectively done.
similar approach had been adopted by llewellyn smith to x ambiguities
on lagrangian level by imposing high energy symmetry, etc. on relevant
quantities [7]. it is also the physical reasoning followed by the conventional
renormalization programs.

here let us elaborate on the implications of the constants. as we have
seen, the cs arise in fact from the low energy limit operation on the objects
calculated in the underlying theory, they should be uniquely dened up to
possible equivalence. dierent or inequivalent choices of these constants sim-
ply correspond to dierent le theories (amount to being dened by dierent
underlying theories). since dierent regularizations and/or renormalization
conditions might correspond to inequivalent choices of the constants, we may
infer, especially in nonperturbative cases (e.g., in ref. [8]), that dierent reg-
ularizations and renormalization conditions might lead to dierent renormal-
ized le theories that even could not faithfully describe relevant low energy
physics. thus in our point of view, the low energy eective theories could not
be totally independent of the underlying theory(s), i.e., the underlying theory

8

stipulates or inuences the eective ones through these constants though the
fundamental parameters characterizing the underlying theory do not appear
in the le formulations. all the known approaches seemed to have ignored
this important aspect. in other words, the underlying structures are not to-
tally decoupled from the eective ones. in the conventional renormalization
schemes, one has to reinterpret the lagrangian parameters (corresponding
to phenomenological ones) to absorb the unphysical innities to make pre-
dictions without discussing whether such reinterpretation could perfectly
reproduce the truth. as we will see in section iv, the former studies on
the self-adjoint extension [9] of some quantum mechanical hamiltonians just
support our point of view here.

3 multi-loop case

since the uv divergence will appear if one rst take the limit before doing
loop momenta integrations, our strategy here is just to move the limit oper-
ator l{} across the integration operations in such a way that no potential
divergence is left over just like in the single loop case.

for any multi-loop graph  (we will use the same symbol to denote the
graph and the associated fa if it is not confusing), we should again start with
the amplitude derived from the underlying theory, i.e., (. . . ; {}) with the
same graph structure. all the internal lines and vertices are again understood
to be given by the underlying theory, which are necessarily characterized
by the presence of the parameters {}. then the le limit of (. . . ; {})
(denoted as 0(. . . ; {c0}) with {c0} indicating the denite constants unknown
to us that are left over by the le limit operation) is just

0(. . . ; {c0}) = l{}(. . . ; {})

= l{}z yl

dnl f({l}, . . . ; {})

(13)

where f({l}, . . . ; {}) denotes the integrand obtained from the underlying
theory corresponding to the graph  and the dots refer to the le parame-
ters like external momenta, mass parameters and coupling constants. other
symbols are self-evident.

if the graph is totally convergent, then 0 contains no uv ambiguity
and the limit operation can cross all the internal integrations to act upon

9

the integrand to yield the product of the propagators and vertices given by
the present qfts. but once there is any potential uv ill-denedness with
any internal integration, one can no longer push the limit operation across
this integration. then following our strategy or the treatment for the one-
loop case, suppose that a graph  contains at least an overall divergence, we
proceed like the following, (we will use in the following   1 to denote the
overall divergence index [4] for any graph  and {l} to represent the internal
momenta and all the partial dierentiation operators and their inverse (1
 )
act upon the momenta only external to the very internal integration of the
graph under consideration)

0(. . . ; {c0

i }) = l{}z y dl f({l}, . . . ; {})

 1

 l{}z y dl f({l}, . . . ; {})

= x{}= 

1

 l{}z y dl f({l}, . . . ; {}).

(14)

here we note that the dierentiation with respect to the external parameters
created a sum of graphs {} (without overall divergence) from the original
graph . (note that any overall overlapping divergence is hence killed by
the  operation, only non-overlapping divergences remain, i.e., the over-
lapping divergences are disentangled [6]). if there is no more ill-denedness
(in any subgraph), one can move the limit operator across all the internal
integrations to act directly upon the integrands f({l}, . . . ; {}) just like in
the totally convergent graph case. now one can carry out all the loop inte-
grations without any trouble for each graph  and then sum them up and
nally apply the inverse operator with respect to the parameters (usually
momenta) external to the graph  (and each ).

but if there are still some ill-dened subgraphs for each , then we can
not move the le limit operator across all the loop integrations. in this case,
each graph in the set  can be expressed as a product of disconnected
divergent (at least overally divergent) subgraphs (each subgraph itself may
contain overlapping divergences), the le limit operator does not commute
with the loop integrations associated with these subgraphs though the other
parts complement to these subgraphs can be applied with the le limit oper-
ator. that is, the le limit operator crossed all the other parts and stopped

the underlying theory that corresponds to each subgraph 
j contained in
. since some loop momenta are external to certain subgraphs, one can
not rst carry out these loop integrations before the ill-dened subgraphs are
treated and the loop integrations for these subgraphs are done. this is in
sheer contrast to the totally convergent graphs where the loop integration
order does not matter.

j

as the ill-dened subgraphs in [] are disconnected with each other, we
now treat each of them separately as a new total graph just like what we
have done with the total graph  starting from eq.(14). then we go through
the procedures from eq.(14) to eq.(17) till we encounter new disconnected
and ill-dened subgraphs that are in turn to be treated as before. finally,
we will go to the smallest subgraphs that are completely convergent. now
we can nally move the le limit operator across all the loop integrations

11

to get the integrands totally expressed with propagators and vertices given
by the eective theories and we can begin to perform all the loop integra-
tions in such an order (a natural order from our treatment): first, perform
the loop integrations for these smallest convergent subgraphs, then by con-
struction perform the inverse dierentiation operator with respect to the
momenta (or masses,etc., depending on technical convenience) external to
these smallest subgraphs, and we will obtain ambiguous but nite expres-
sions in terms of these external parameters as generalized vertices for the
higher level subgraphs which again by construction are convergent ones even
with the generalized vertices. secondly, go backward to carry out the loop
integrations for these next-to-smallest subgraphs rst and then perform the
inverse operation if any associated with these subgraphs, we will again ar-
rive at generalized vertices for still larger subgraphs with more ambiguities
appearing with the inverse operation. [it is worthwhile to note that at each
level of the subgraphs, the loop integrations are guaranteed to be convergent
due to weinbergs theorem [10]]. the process goes on till all loop integrations
and all inverse operations are done.

the resulting expression will be a denite nonlocal functions plus nonlocal
ambiguities (due to subgraph ill-denedness) and local ambiguities if  is
suering from overall divergence,

= npl

0(. . . ; {c0})  (. . . ; {c})
0 (. . .) + npl
{c }[{ c } = {c}.

1 (. . . ; {c }) + n (. . . ; { c }),

(18)
(19)

here again we used n  to denote the polynomial containing the ambiguities
({ c }) appearing due to the overall divergence. others are nonlocal func-
tions. dierent from the single loop case, there are nonlocal ambiguities in
this multiloop graph suering from subgraph divergences (as evident from
our treatment) in addition to the nonlocal denite part and the local am-
biguous part. the result we obtained ((. . . ; {c})) is not what we are really
after (0(. . . ; {c0})), but that is the best we can do with the present qft.
with the above deduction, one can easily see that the results of any
regularization and/or renormalization scheme can be readily reproduced by
corresponding choices of the constants. that is, our proposal can lead to a
universal formulation for all the regularization and renormalization schemes
at least in the perturbative framework.
if one wish to pursue calculation

12

eciency in the rst place, one can choose a regularization scheme that
saves labor and just replace all the divergent expressions with an ambiguous
polynomial in external parameters and there is no loss in doing so but a
new gain in that one can ignore the defects of the original regularization
scheme. conventionally one has to check whether the symmetry properties
of a scheme would aect the main body of a theory and/or works very hard
in order to setup a scheme as consistently as possible. our proposal saves the
labor of checking every corner of a scheme and just make use of its eciency.
of course, if one insisted on working within a regularization scheme without
appreciating the underlying theory aspects elaborated above, he would get into
trouble sooner or later. we will serve some simple examples in section iv.

now some remarks are in order:
a. it is evident that overlapping divergences are just automatically re-
solved in our proposal, there is nothing special about it. this is because
the dierentiation operators just remove the overlapping ill-denedness by
inserting internal lines and vertices to reduce the overall divergence. thus
one need not worry about them any more. this is the utility derived from
the dierentiation with respect to external parameters (momenta, masses or
other massive parameters that might appear in the le propagators) [6]. this
also dispenses the laborious construction of the counter terms when there are
overlapping divergences in the usual renormalization framework.

b. the amplitudes given by the underlying theory should be denite by
assumption and remain unchanged under any linear transformations of the
internal integration variables provided that the determinants of the jacobians
for the transformations are identities.
in our treatment of the ill-dened
graphs, since every loop integration actually performed is convergent, these
transformations do not alter the results of the loop integrations. due to the
inverse operations, these linear transformations would at most change the
polynomial part. but that does not matter at all. this observation implies
that one should not worry about the variable shifting and routing of the
external momenta that belong to the transformations just described if he
has noted the ambiguous part.

b1. an immediate corollary to this observation is that, the chiral anomaly,
which is conventionally interpreted as due to the variable shifting in relevant
linearly divergent amplitude, must have been due to other denite proper-
ties. otherwise, if it were totally due to the local ambiguities, one can well
remove them away by choosing appropriate denitions of the constants (or

13

appropriate renormalization conditions). our direct calculation shows that
[5, 11], one kind of denite rational terms (independent of masses) originated
the chiral anomaly. since they are nonlocal and unambiguous, one can not
attribute them simply as uv eects. the trace anomaly is also shown to
be originated by such kind of rational terms [5, 11]. to our best knowledge,
this nontrivial structure (independent of the uv ambiguities) has never been
noted before in the old renormalization framework.

b2. another utility derived from the observation is that, one can choose
routings of the external momenta to be as simple as possible to make the
treatments of an ill-dened multi-loop amplitude as easy as possible. for the
single loop cases, sometimes one may only focus on the parts of the amplitude
that are really divergent. this may yield fewer ambiguities.

c. with the above deduction, one can easily see that the results of any
regularization and/or renormalization scheme can be readily reproduced by
corresponding choices of the constants. that is, our proposal can lead to a
universal formulation for all the regularization and renormalization schemes
at least in the perturbative framework.
if one wish to pursue calculation
eciency in the rst place, one can choose a regularization scheme that
saves labor and just replace all the divergent expressions with an ambiguous
polynomial in external parameters and there is no loss in doing so but a
new gain in that one can ignore the defects of the original regularization
scheme. conventionally one has to check whether the symmetry properties
of a scheme would aect the main body of a theory and/or works very hard
in order to setup a scheme as consistently as possible. our proposal saves the
labor of checking every corner of a scheme and just make use of its eciency.
of course, if one insisted on working within a regularization scheme without
appreciating the underlying theory aspects elaborated above, he would get into
trouble sooner or later. we will serve some simple examples in section iv.

for the amiguities, as we have discussed in the section ii, we may rst
impose some novel symmetries and invariances on the amplitudes to reduce
the ambiguities to certain degree, then one has to resort to the experimental
physics data, a strategy eectively employed in the conventional renormal-
ization approaches. the w-t identities have served as eective constraints
in the conventional renormalization schemes and saved a lot of labor of calcu-
lation. they are just certain kinds of graphical relations among the feynman
graphs. so, in the feynman graph language, we can derive constraints upon
the ambiguities from the graph structures [2].

14

as we have pointed out, the feynman amplitudes or the 1pi functions are
generally parametrized by more than one constants (i will refer to them as
agent constants) in addition to the phenomenological ones. if the changes in
the radiative constants could be completely compensated by that in the phe-
nomenological ones (which is only possible for rather special kind of models),
then we might implement a redenition invariance of the phenomenological
constants or parameters for the fas like in the rg case. recently we have
rederived the callan-symanzik like equations governing the scale transfor-
mation behaviors of qfts without resort to conventional renormalization
programs. the inuences of the underlying structures eected through the
agent constants are clearly shown and these agent constants complete the
harmony of the scale transformation of the eective qfts in the sense di-
cussed in ref. [12]. moreover, the new equations improved the conventional
ones in quite some aspects and some subtle issues associated with the renor-
malization group equations are easily claried.

we wish to note that since there is no room for divergence and hence no
room for bare parameters in our proposal, the so-called mass scale hierarchy
problem in the standard model [13] may become less serious if one adopts our
proposal, the ne-tuning problem will be superceded by the determination
of the radiatively-arised constants (which should be taken as the inuences
from the underlying theory, just what we discussed above)from physical re-
quirements. thus, the original need for the supersymmetry [14] to cancell
certain uv divergences in order to overcome this ne-tuning [13] would in
our approach become important impositions on the ambiguities.

4 nonperturbative examples

from the presentation above, it is clear that our proposal works in principle
for any model, whether it is a qft or not. the key observation that the uv
ill-denedness is caused by illegitimate order of operations is valid for both
perturbative framework and the non-perturbative ones, see eq.(1) to eq.(3).
that is to say, our approach should apply to nonperturbative calculations,
with perhaps some other operations with respect to the external parameters.
recently, the cuto and dimensional regularizations are compared in non-
perturbative context within quantum mechanics [8] in relation to the hot
topic of applying the idea of eective eld theory method (eft [15]) to le

15

nuclear physics following weinbergs suggestion [16]. the resulting theory
is a non-relativistic quantum mechanics with delta-potentials, which are in
fact singular in the short-distance behavior by birth. according to our dis-
cussions above, such ill-denedness means that the eective le models must
have failed in the higher energy end. then it is illegitimate to simply work
with the propagators and vertices (or green functions and potentials) given
by such models. great care must also be taken with respect to the reg-
ularization eects. thus the inequivalence between the cuto scheme and
dimensional regularization exhibited in ref. [8] well evidenced the correct-
ness of our arguments advanced above.

now let us try to treat the problem within our proposal. generally, the
lippmann-schwinger equation for t -matrix in the simple two-body problems
formally reads (we follow the notation conventions of ref. [8])

t (p, p; e) = v (p, p) +z

ddk
(2)d v (p, k)

1

e+  k2/(2)

t (k, p; e),

(20)

where e+ is e + i, with e non-negative, and  denotes the reduced mass
in the two-body problem.
in our point of view, this equation is not well-
dened and should be written as the le limit of that derived from the more
fundamental underlying theory which is unavailable to us by now.
[ we
should note that, the underlying parameters will be always denoted as {}.
for dierent problems or dierent le ranges, the contents may dier.] so in
our language, eq.(20) should be rewritten as

t (p, p; e; {}) = v (p, p; {}) +z

ddk
(2)2 v (p, k; {})

g(e+  k2/(2); {})t (k, p; e; {}),

v (p, p)  l{}v (p, p; {}),
1

 l{}g(e+  k2/(2); {}).

e+  k2/(2)

(21)

(22)

eq.(21) is now well-dened in the underlying theory. thus eq.(20) is correct
only when there is no uv innities (there is no ir problem in the following
discussions for the delta-potential problem) so that the le limit operator
can cross the internal momentum integration (summation over intermediate
states) and act on everything. otherwise we have to nd a legitimate way

16

to let the le limit operator cross everything (acting on everything) so that
we can calculate with the objects given by the le theories.

in the case of delta-potential, v (p, p) = c, but the v (. . . ; {}) is gen-
erally a nonlocal potential before the le limit is taken. to be rigorous, we
write formally

t (p, p; e; {c0}) = c + l{}(z

ddk
(2)d v (p, k; {})

g(e+  k2/(2); {})t (p, p; e; {})o ,

(23)

here it is not generally legitimate move the v (. . . ; {}) out of the integration
to be directly subject to the le limit operatorwhich is exactly what was
done in the conventional calculation (with only the propagator regularized)
and it is denitely illegitimate to apply the le limit operator to all the other
objects before the integration is done. thus, in principle, even when the le
potential is local (of course v (. . . ; {}) is nonlocal), it might be dangerous to
simply reduce eq.(21) to an algebraic one. only when the ill-denedness is
mainly caused by 1/(e+ k2/(2)) (i.e., it diers greatly from g(. . . ; {}) in
the uv region where v (. . .) diers less from v (. . . ; {})), could we pull out
the true potential to subject it directly to the action of the le limit operator.
in other words, to put eq.(21) (a correct formulation for eq.(20)) or eq. (23)
into an algebraic one requires quite nontrivial properties of the potential and
the propagator, which the usual analysis failed to note. to focus on the
main point, we temporarily assume this condition is satised, then we have
the well-dened form of the algebraic equation for the t matrix (which is
now parametrized by the new constants {c0} from the le limit in addition
to e),

1

t on(e; {c0})

=

 i(e; {c0}),

1
c

(24)

(25)

with

i(e; {c0}) = l{}z

ddk
(2)d g(e+  k2/(2); {}).

now we can employ the technique described in sections ii and iii to calculate
the integrals, i.e., rst dierentiate g(e+. . . ; . . .) with respect to e+ (which
is the external parameter in the integral) for appropriate times, secondly
perform the le limit legitimately and carry out the integral thus obtained,

17

nally do the inverse operation with respect to e and we nd the followings
(note that here one dierentiation with respect to e reduces the divergence
degree by two)

id;odd(e; {c0})  id;o(e; {c})

= i

2d/2+1
(d/2)(2)d (2e)d/21 + n [(d1)/2](2e; {c});

id;even(e; {c0})  id;e(e; {c})

2d/2

0) + n [d/2](2e; {c})

=

(26)

(27)

with {c} being arbitrary constantsthe ambiguities. these expressions can
again be viewed as universal parametrizations and compared with that given
in cuto regularization and dimensional regularization schemes (c.f. ref [8])
with the latter ones as special cases.

in terms of the ambiguous (but nite ) integrals given by eq.(26,27), the

t matrix is now parametrized by {c} in addition to e like

1

t on(e; {c})

=

1
c

 id;...(e; {c}).

(28)

again we need to x the constants {c} rather than to renormalizationormal-
ize the interaction constant c.

it is easy to see that following the normalization condition of ref. [8], we
can reproduce the result derived by weinberg [16] in two or three dimensional
space-time. however, there seems to be no necessary constraints on the
phenomenological constant c as it is physical rather than  bare in our
proposal. thus, this le framework a la weinberg [16] serves equally well
for both the attractive interactions and the repulsive ones if one adopts our
proposal (i.e., admits that the underlying theory is well dened), contrary
to the conclusions that eft framework failed in the repulsive cases where
the le models are believed to be trivial [17, 18, 19]. the nontriviality of the
delta-potential dynamics has also been investigated by jackiw [20]. in our
point of view, since all the known models must have been some kind of le
limits of an underlying thoery, there is no point in trying to extrapolate the
properties of an eective model to arbitrary region and the calculations done
with the propagators and vertices given by this eective model are of course

18

problematic if the regularization scheme used does not faithfully reproduce
the underlying structures. a model is trivial only when all the 1pi green
functions given there (with our proposal incorporated) vanish identically for
all relevant energy levels.

this problem can be investigated from another angle. jackiw had already
pointed out [20] that the hamiltonians for such models are not automatically
hermitean but need self-adjoint extension. this has already been dealt with
by mathematicians in the operator theory [21] and has also been extensively
discussed in a number of approaches (please refer to [22] for a comprehensive
list of the references). each approach, if viewed from our standpoint, amounts
to a way of retrieving the lost information about the uv underlying struc-
tures. the key point is, in such cases, the self-adjointness of the hamiltonian
is never an automatic property. that is, in contrast to the normal case, the
contact potential problem a la schrodinger equation is uv ill-dened. the
resolution of the problem gives rise to a family of self-adjoint extensions of
the original hamiltonian operator parametrized by an additional constant,
which upon dierent choices leads to dierent or inequivalent (le) physics
[9]. this additional family parameter is just the constant that will surely be
predicted from the le limit operation in our proposal, corresponding to the
ambiguity whose denition requires most attention as has been emphasized
in section ii and iii. as a matter of fact, there is an approach that is quite
the same as ours in spirit, the one based on resolvent formalism [23] where
an important object is dened through an equation in which it appeared in
a form dierentiated with respect to the external parameterthe resolvent
variable (energy). thus this important object is only dened up to an addi-
tional parameter (the family parameter in operator theory approach) within
the present quantum mechnics which is to be determined by other input, just
like in our proposal.

i would like to mention a recent calculation [24] of higgs masses in non-
perturbative context employing our proposal. the results thus obtained are
neat and clear, in contrast to that performed within the old renormalization
framework (see the references in [24]). especially, the physical pictures are
dierent from that using the old renormalization, which is now easy to see
from the discussions above.

one could expect that great ease can be found in employing our proposal
or its equivalents (in any form known or unknown) in his/her studies in the
nonperturbative contexts and the outcome would be quite dierent and sig-

19

nicant. moreover, within our approach, those phenomenologically oriented
models which are unrenormalizable in the usual renormalization schemes
could become quite tamed. one can test it with the njl model and chiral
perturbation theory [25] and with gravity [26]. we also note that the prin-
cipally nonperturbative eective action formalism [27] which is widely used,
if equipped with our strategy, will greatly help to illuminate relevant topics
and to produce quite dierent but nonetheless physical conclusions which are
often unattainable within the old schemes.

5 discussions and summary

about the unphysical ir innities, we could also postulate that similar rea-
soning works for the ir divergence. for a complete representation of the
world, we should expect that the underlying theory is also well dened in the
ir sector. (our discussions in the introduction about the spectra are partial
as we deliberately omitted the ir issues to focus on the uv structures.) it
is conceivable that the phenomenological models give wrong information of
the ir end spectra signaled by the unphysical ir innities.

the underlying theory, postulated here, if exists, should contain all the
nontrivial uv and ir structural information lost in the eective theories.
then an interesting scenario dawns upon us: for each eective model domi-
nating certain energy range (say, theory tmid), there should exist two other
eective models (or sectors) that are most adjacent to this model from the ir
end and uv end respectively (say, tir and tu v ). then it is imaginable that
the phenomenological parameters in tir and/or tu v would at least quite
nontrivially improve the ir and/or uv behaviors of the theory tmid. while
on the other hand, the tmid contains what tir (respecially tu v ) needs to
improve its uv (respecially ir) behaviors. put it another way, the active
and elementary modes or elds in tir will break up in tmid and give way
to the new elementary modes active in tmid. similarly, the elementary
modes in tmid will go hibernating as the energy goes down while new el-
ementary modes emerge to dominate spectra in tir. the relation between
the elementary modes in tmid and tu v is in principle just like that between
those in tir and tmid. of course, there may be modes active in several
successive eective models, some may even be active and stable through all
energy levelsthe fossil modes or elds we mentioned in the introduction.

20

evidently, the information about those elementary modes in tir and tu v
missing from tmid (i.e., missing from the eective spectrum given by tmid)
can contribute to improve the ir and uv behavior of the latter.

of course the author does not have a solid idea for the answer right
now. thus we only indicate some interesting but plausible picture about the
resolution of the unphysical ir problem or the reformulation of the ir end
of a theory suered from ir problems like qcd.

from our proposal, the elementarycommutator for a eld and its con-
jugate, if calculated (or formulated) from the underlying theory, must have
been at least a nonlocal function(al) parametrized by the underlying param-
eters of the underlying theory and must have been closely related with the
gravitational interaction and perhaps new fundamental ones, rather than a
highly abstract dirac delta function containing least information. in a sense,
the incompleteness of the present qfts or their ill-denedness is inherent in
the present quantization procedure whose most elementary technical building
block is the dirac delta function (called as distribution by mathematicians)
that is extremely singular and oversimplied in the uv ends. that the dis-
tribution theory works necessarily with test function space or appropriate
measure, if viewed from physical angle, is equivalent to that we need more
fundamental structures in order for some singular functions to make sense,
i.e., a necessity of introducing underlying theory or its articial substitute
regularization. the constructive eld theory approach, in this sense, also
works with a regularization eected through the dierential properties(c k)
of the test functions.

in summary, we discussed in some detail the strategy recently proposed by
the author and the important consequences following from it. the proposal
could overcome many typical diculties and shortcomings associated with
old regularization and renormalization frameworks.
