classical description of relativistic pointlike particle with intrinsic degrees of freedom
such as isospin or colour is proposed. it is based on the lagrangian of general form dened
on the tangent bundle over a principal bre bundle. it is shown that the dynamics splits into
the external dynamics which describes the interaction of particle with gauge eld in terms
of wong equations, and the internal dynamics which results in a spatial motion of particle
via integrals of motion only. a relevant hamiltonian description is built too.

introduction

wong equations of motion of classical pointlike relativistic particle with isospin or colour [1] per-
mit various lagrangian and hamiltonian formulations. two of them [2, 3] known to the author
are based on geometric notions brought from gauge eld theories. namely, the conguration
space of particle is a principal bre bundle with the structure group being the gauge group;
the interaction of particle with an external gauge eld is introduced via the connection on this
bundle. the only dierence between two approaches consists in the choice of lagrangian func-
tion. that proposed in [2] is linear in gauge potentials (as in classical electrodynamics) while
the nonlinear lagrangian [3, 2] arises naturally within the kaluzaklein theory. nevertheless,
both of them lead to the same wong equations.

in the present paper, starting from the mentioned above geometrical treatment of the kine-
matics of relativistic particle with isospin or colour (section 2), we construct in section 3 the
lagrangian of a fairy general form. in particular cases this lagrangian reduces to those of refs.
[2, 3]. the generalization is not trivial since it leads to two types of dynamics, according to what
variables are used for the description of intrinsic degrees of freedom. the external dynamics
is described by the wong equations which include gauge potentials, but the form of which is
indierent to the choice of lagrangian. on the contrary, the internal dynamics is governed by
the particular choice of lagrangian function while gauge potentials completely fall out of this
dynamics. this fact becomes more transparent within the framework of the appropriate hamil-
tonian formalism developed in section 4. in section 5 we sum up our results and discuss the
perspectives of quantization.

2 kinematics on a principal bre bundle

following refs.
[2, 3] we take for a conguration space of relativistic particle with isospin
or colour the principal bre bundle p over minkowski space iim with structure group g and
projection  : p  iim (see ref.
[4] for these notions). a particle trajectory  : ir  p;
 7 p( )  p is parameterized by evolution parameter  . a state of particle is determined by
(p, p)  tp .

in this paper we are not interested in the global structure of p, and use its local coordina-
tization: p  p = (x, g ) = (x, gi),  = 0, 3, i = 1, dim g, where x = (p)  u  iim (u is an
open subset of iim), g = (p)  g, and  : p  g denes the choice of gauge. respectively,
p = ( x, g ), where x  txiim and g  t g g. we call (x, x) and ( g , g ) the space and the intrinsic
(local) variables of particle respectively.

let the principal bre bundle p be endowed with a connection dened by 1-form  on p

which takes values in lie algebra g of g. locally it can be represented as follows [4]:

 = ad g 1(a (x)dx) + g 1d g  g 1 ((a (x)dx)) g + g 1d g ,

(1)

where  is the pull back mapping onto p, ad denotes the adjoint representation of g in g, and
g-valued functions a (x) are gauge potentials. under a right action of g dened in p by

r h : p 7 p  r h (x, g ) = (x, g h ),

h  g,

the connection form transforms via a pull back mapping r
ad h 1 , h  g.

h and is equivariant, i.e., r

h

(2)

 =

a gauge transformation arises in a geometrical treatment as a bundle automorphism dened

by

 h (x) : p 7 p   h (x)(x, g ) = (x, h(x) g ),

h (x)  g.

(3)

it induces the transformation of the connection form dened by the inverse of the pull back
mapping (actually, a push forward mapping),    = [ h 1(x)], so that the value of the
connection form on each vector eld is gauge-invariant by denition. the transformed form 
is also expressed by eqs. (1), but with new potentials

a 

(x) = h (x)a (x) h 1(x) + h(x) h 1(x).

(4)

the minkowski metrics    dx  dx, k k = diag (+, , , ) is dened on base space
iim. it is invariant under the poincare group acting in iim. being pulled back by  onto p it
becomes also right- and gauge-invariant, but appears degenerate.

here we suppose that the lie algebra g of structure group g is endowed with non-degenerate
ad-invariant metrics h 
 i. the example is the killing-cartan metrics in the case of semi-
simple group. in terms of this metrics, the connection form, and the minkowski metrics one can
construct a nondegenerate metrics on the bundle p [3],

,

 =   a2h, i

(5)

(a is a constant), which is right- and gauge-invariant but not poincare-invariant (the latter is
broken by ). in the case of bundle over a curved base space the minkowski metrics on the
right-hand side (r.h.s.) of eq. (5) is replaced by the riemanian one. in this form the metrics 
arises in the kaluza-klein theory [5] which allows to unify the description of gravitational and
yang-mills elds.

3 lagrangian dynamics of particle with isospin or colour

the dynamical description of the relativistic particle with isospin or colour should, at least,
satisfy the following conditions:

i) gauge invariance;
ii) invariance under an arbitrary change of evolution parameter;
iii) poincare invariance provided gauge potentials vanish.

2

these demands can be embodied in the action i = r d l(p, p) with the following lagrangian

l = | x|f (w ),

(6)

where w  ( p)/| x|,
we note that the quantities | x|, ( p), and thus the variable w and the lagrangian (6) are
gauge-invariant.

| x|  p x x = p( p, p), and f : g  ir is an arbitrary function.

in order to calculate the variation i of the action i it is convenient to use, instead of intrinsic
velocity g and variation g , the following variables: v  g g 1 and g  g g 1. they take
values in lie algebra g of group g. then the argument w of f can be presented in the form

w = ad g 1(v + a  x)/| x|.

using the formal technique (see ref. [6] for rigorous substantiation)

g 1 =  g 1g g 1,

v = ( g g 1) =  g g 1 + g g 1 =

d
d
(ad g 1 v ) = ( g 1 v g ) = ad g 1(v + [v , g ])

g  [v , g ],

(7)

(8)

etc., where [
the following euler-lagrange equations:



,



] are lie brackets in g and v is an arbitrary g-valued quantity, we obtain

p = q  ( a ) x ,

q = ad

where p are spatial momentum variables, and q is an intrinsic momentum-type variable which
takes values in co-algebra g. the linear operators ad and ad dene co-adjoint representations
of g and g respectively, dot    denotes a contraction.

first of all we show that the function

is an integral of motion. for this purpose let us introduce the following g-valued variable:

m (w )  f 

f

(13)

(14)

in contrast to q, it is gauge-invariant. taking into account the equations (14) and (10) we
obtain after a bit calculation the equation:

then m =  s  w =  s  [w , w ]| x|  0 q.e.d.

using this fact and (10) in (9) yields the equations of spatial motion

s = ad

| x| w s .

(16)

where f    a    a  + [a , a ]. equations (16) together with the equation (10) or (15)
of intrinsic motion determine the particle dynamics on a principal bre bundle.

now we suppose the existence in lie algebra g of non-degenerate metrics h  ,

 i. it allows
to identify g and g. in particular, for co-vector q  g we introduce the corresponding vector
q  g, such that q = hq ,

 i. then the equations of motion (16) and (10) take the form

m

= hq , f  i x,

x
| x|

d
d
q = [q, a ] x.

(17)

(18)

besides, if this metrics is ad-invariant, the quantity hq , qi is an integral of motion.

at this stage we have obtained the well-known wong equations (17)(18) which describe the
dynamics of a relativistic particle with mass m and isospin or colour q. despite that we started
with the lagrangian (6) of a fairy general form, this arbitrariness is obscured in the wong
equations. the reason resides in denitions of m and q which are, in general, complicated
functions on tp. this feature is better understood by analyzing equations (16) and (10) which
are very similar to the wong equations but do not involve the metrics in g.

in general, the set of eqs. (16) and (10) is of the second order with respect to conguration
variables x and g . in this regard it is quite equivalent to the set of eqs. (16) and (15). on the
other hand, the equations (16) and (10) form a self-contained set in terms of variables x and q.
they involve explicitly potentials of external gauge eld, but their form is indierent to a choice
of lagrangian.

the equation (15) is the closed rst-order equation with respect to w or, if eq.

(14) is
invertible, with respect to s (the quantity | x| is not essential because of a parametric invariance
of dynamics; we can put, for instance, | x| = 1). in contrast to the set (16), (10), the equation
(15) is determined by a choice of the lagrangian, but, in terms of w or s , it does not include
gauge potentials.

hence, the dynamics of isospin particle splits into the external dynamics described by the
equations (16), (10) in terms of variables x and q, and the internal dynamics determined by
the equation (15) in terms of w or s . the only coupling of these realizations of dynamics is
provided via integrals of motion, namely, the particle mass m and (if ad-invariant metrics is

involved) the isospin module |q|  phq , qi = |s |.

in the following examples we show that the general description of isospin particle includes,
as particular cases, results known in the literature. besides, we demonstrate some new features
concerning the internal dynamics.

1. linear lagrangian. electrodynamics. the simplest choice of lagrangian (6) leading

to non-trivial intrinsic dynamics corresponds to the following function f (w ):

f (w ) = m + k  w ,

(19)

where m  ir and k  g are constants. up to notation it coincides with the lagrangian
proposed by balachandran et al.
g 1 k is purely
conguration variable (it does not depend on velocities) and the equation (10) is truly the rst-
order euler-lagrange equation. besides, m and s are constants, i.e., m = m,
s = k, thus the
internal dynamics completely degenerates.

[2]. in this case the isospin q = ad

in ref.

the lagrangian (6), (19) is linear with respect to gauge potentials a . in the case of one-
parametric gauge group u (1) it reduces to that of electrodynamics. indeed, in this case we have
g = exp(i), v = i , a  = ia. choosing k = ie, where e is the charge of electron, one can
present the lagrangian in the form:

l = m| x| + ea x + e .

(20)

4

the third term on r.h.s. of (20) is a total derivative and thus it can be omitted. hence, intrinsic
variables disappear in this lagrangian, and the latter takes the standard form.

the similar situation occurs when considering an arbitrary abelian gauge group.
2. right-invariant lagrangian. kaluza-klein theory. the following choice of the

function f (w ):

f (w ) = f (|w |),

|w |  qhw , w i = |v + a  x|/| x|,

(21)

where f : ir  ir is an arbitrary function of |w |, corresponds to lagrangian which is invariant
under the right action of g. following the noether theorem there exist corresponding integrals of
motion. in the present case they form g-valued co-vector s dened by eq. (14) or, equivalently,
g-valued vector

s = |w |1f (|w |)w ,

(22)

where f (|w |)  d f /d |w |. we note that the integrals of motion s and m (w ) are not indepen-
dent. indeed, if f (|w |) is not constant, the mass m can be presented as a function of |s | = |q|.
otherwise both these quantities are constants. thus the mass m and the isospin module |q|
are completely determined by the external dynamics.

the right-invariant lagrangian of special kind arises naturally in the framework of kaluza-

klein theory [5]. it has the following form [3, 2]:

where the metrics  on a principle bundle p is introduced by eq. (5). in our notations this
lagrangian corresponds to the choice:

l = mq( p, p),

(23)

this function determines the following relation between m and |q |:

f (|w |) = mq1  a2|w |2.

m (|q |) = qm2 + |q|2/a2.

(24)

(25)

3.

isospin top.

in the above two examples the internal dynamics does not aect the

external dynamics. here we consider a contrary example. let

f (w ) = f (),

  qhw , t w i,

where t is a self-adjoint (in the metrics h  ,

 i) linear operator. in this case we have

s = 1f ()t w ,

m = f ()  f ().

(26)

(27)

if the function f () is not linear, the quantity  turns out to be an integral of motion which
is independent of |q |. then using the parameterization | x| = 1 one can reduce eq.(15) to the
following equation of internal motion:

t w = [t w , w ].

(28)

this is nothing but the compact form of euler equations (i.e., the equations of motion of a free
top) generalized to the case of arbitrary group [7]. a solution of this equation is necessary for
evaluation of the observable mass of particle.

the relation between the external dynamics and the internal one becomes more transparent

within the hamiltonian formalism which we consider in the next section.

4 transition to hamiltonian description

the lagrangian description on the conguration space p enables a natural transition to the
hamiltonian formalism with constraints [8] on the cotangent bundle tp over p. locally,
tp  tu  tg and, in turn, tg  g  g. the latter isomorphism is established by right
or left action of group g on tg (see, for instance, [9]). it is implicitly meant in our notation.
namely, we coordinatize tg by variables ( g , q) or ( g , s ).

let us introduce basis vectors e i  g satisfying the lie-bracket relations [e i, e j] = ck

ij e k,
ij are the structure constant of g, and basis co-vectors e i  g such that e j  e i = j
where ck
i .
then the standard symplectic structure on the cotangent bundle tp over the manifold p can be
expressed in terms of local coordinates x, p, gi and qj  q  e j by the following poisson-bracket
relations:

{x, p } = 
 ,

{qi, qj} = ck

ijqk,

{gi, qj} =  i

j( g )

(29)

(other brackets are equal to zero), where  j
i ( g ) are the components of right-invariant vector elds
on g. equivalently, we can use variables sj  s  e j instead of qj. then the poisson-bracket
relations take the form:

{x, p } = 
 ,

{si, sj} = ck

ijsk,

{gi, sj} = i

j( g ),

(30)

where j

i ( g ) are the components of left-invariant vector elds on g.

once the poisson brackets are dened, we can use in calculations both sets of variables. in

particular, taking into account the relation s = ad

g q we obtain:

{qi, sj} = 0.

(31)

the transition from the lagrangian description to the hamiltonian one lies through the
legendre transformation dened by eqs. (11) and (12) or (14). it is degenerate and leads to
the vanishing canonical hamiltonian, due to parametrical invariance. instead, the dynamics is
determined by constraints.

in order to obtain constraints explicitly let us consider the relations (13) and (14). they
present, in fact, the legendre mapping w 7 s and thus allow to consider the mass m as a
function of s only. then eq. (11) reduces to

  p  q  a  = m ( s ) x/| x|

which yields immediately the mass-shell constraint:

  2  m 2( s ) = 0.

there are no more constraints if

otherwise, eq. (14) leads to additional constraints of the following general structure:

det(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

6= 0.

2f (w )

wiwj (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

r( s ) = 0,

r = 1,   dim g

(32)

(33)

(34)

(35)

which together with the mass-shell constraint (33) form the set of primary constraints. hence,
the dirac hamiltonian is hd = 0 + rr, where 0, r are lagrange multipliers. it is evident
from eqs. (33), (35) and (29), (30), (31) that secondary constraints (should they exist) are of
the same general structure as in eq. (35). at the nal stage of analysis the mass-shell constraint

6

can be considered as the rst-class one. this is provided as soon the mass squared m 2( s ) is
conserved. if it is not, there exists another integral of motion m 2( s ) such that m 2( s )|=0 =
m 2( s ). then the rst-class mass-shell constraint has the form (33) but with the function m 2( s )
instead of m 2( s ).

the total set of constraints is gauge-invariant. this follows from the transformation prop-

erties of gauge potentials (4) and variables:

x = x,

p

 = p  q (cid:16) h 1(x) h(x)(cid:17) ,

q  = ad

h 1(x) q,

s  = s .

(36)

in particular, the variables  dened in eq. (32) are gauge-invariant.

at this stage the splitting of particle dynamics into the external and internal ones becomes

obvious. indeed, the hamiltonian equations

( x, p, q) = {(x, p, q), hd}  0{(x, p, q), 2},

(37)

where  is diracs symbol of weak equality, are closed with respect to variables (x, p, q). they
describe the external dynamics and can be reduced to the equations (16) and (10) by eliminating
the variables p and the multiplier 0. the equation

s = { s , hd}  0{ s , m 2( s )} + r{ s , r( s )}

(38)

is closed in terms of s and can be reduced to the equation (15) of the internal dynamics. we
note that the group variable g falls out of the equations (37) and (38) which is due to the
structure of poisson-bracket relations (29), (30), (31) and constraints (33), (35). thus in the
present formulation of isospin particle dynamics this variable can be considered as redundant
unobservable quantity.

the further treatment of hamiltonian dynamics, i.e., the classication of constrains as rst-

and second-class ones etc., demands a consideration of some specic examples.

5 conclusions

in this paper we consider the formulation of classical dynamics of the relativistic particle in an
external yang-mills eld. we have deduced the wong equations from the lagrangian of rather
general form dened on the tangent bundle over principle bre bundle. besides, we have shown
that this lagrangian leads to some internal particle dynamics. the only quantities coupling
this dynamics with the wong equations are the mass m and isospin (or colour) module |q|,
the intrinsic characteristics of particle. in the present description they are integrals of internal
motion.

the physical treatment of internal dynamics should become better understood within an
appropriate quantum-mechanical description.
it can be constructed on the base of hamilto-
nian particle dynamics proposed in section 4. here we only suggest some features of such a
description.

following the procedure of canonical quantization one replaces dynamical variables x, p, q, s
etc. by operators x, p, q, s , and poisson brackets by commutators. let us suppose that the
classical dynamics is determined by the only mass-shell constraint (33). its quantum analogue
determines physical states of the system. eigenvalues q and m of operators | q |2 = |s|2 and
m 2(s ) which commute with mass-shell constraint and with one another can be treated as the
isospin (or colour) and the rest mass of particle.
in the case of right-invariant dynamics (as
in kaluza-klein theory) m is unambiguous function of q. in the general case, the spectrum of
m 2(s ) can consist of few levels mqn which correspond to the same value of q. thus it is tempting
to relate the quantum number n with a avour or generation. of course, this supposition is by

7

no means substantiated and needs a following elaboration. it may suggest a phenomenological
quantum description of relativistic particles with intrinsic degrees of freedom type of isospin,
colour, avour etc.
