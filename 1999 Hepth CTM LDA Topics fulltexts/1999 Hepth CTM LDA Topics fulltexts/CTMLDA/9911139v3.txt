abstract

supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models are obtained from linear sigma

models by imposing supersymmetric constraints. if we introduce auxiliary chi-

ral and vector superelds, these constraints can be expressed by d-terms and

f-terms depending on the target manifolds. auxiliary vector superelds ap-

pear as gauge elds without kinetic terms. if there are no d-term constraints,

the target manifolds are always non-compact manifolds. when all the degrees

of freedom in these non-compact directions are eliminated by gauge symme-

tries, the target manifold becomes compact. all supersymmetric nonlinear

sigma models, whose target manifolds are the hermitian symmetric spaces,

are successfully formulated as gauge theories.

1 introduction

when the global symmetry g is spontaneously broken down to its subgroup h, there

appear massless nambu-goldstone (ng) bosons corresponding to broken generators

of the coset manifold g/h. at low energies, interactions among these massless par-

ticles are described by the so-called nonlinear sigma models, whose lagrangians are

completely determined by the geometry of the target manifold g/h, parameterized

by ng-bosons [1].

in supersymmetric theories, there appear massless fermions as supersymmetric

partners of ng-bosons [2]. these massless fermions together with ng-bosons are

described by chiral superelds in four dimensional theories with n = 1 supersym-

metry. since chiral superelds are complex, the supersymmetric nonlinear sigma

models are closely related to the complex geometry; their target manifolds, where

elds variables take their values, must be kahler manifolds [3]. if the coset mani-

fold g/h itself happens to be a kahler manifold, both real and imaginary parts of

the scalar components of chiral superelds are ng-bosons. if g/h is not a kahler

manifold, on the other hand, there is at least one chiral supereld whose real or

imaginary part is not a ng-boson. this additional massless boson is called the

quasi-nambu-goldstone (qng) boson [2, 4].

the general method to construct supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models has

been discussed by bando, kuramoto, maskawa and uehara (bkmu) [5]. when

qng bosons are present, their eective lagrangians include arbitrary functions.

this is always the case when the target manifold of the nonlinear sigma model is

larger than the coset manifold g/h, where ng-bosons reside, since the geometry of

the target manifold cannot be xed by the metric of its subspace g/h [6][10]. the

arbitrariness reects the ambiguity of the metric in the direction of qng bosons.

when the coset manifold g/h is itself kahler, the eective lagrangian is uniquely

determined by the geometry of g/h, as has been shown in a beautiful paper by

itoh, kugo and kunitomo [11]. (see appendix a for a review.) kahler potentials

in this case have been discussed by many authors [5, 11][18] (see references in

ref. [18].), and have been used to construct the coset unication models, where

1

fermionic partners of ng bosons are considered as quarks [19].

nonlinear sigma models are considered low energy eective theories for massless

particles after integrating out the massive particles in the corresponding linear sigma

models. in this context, lerche and shore have shown that nonlinear sigma models

whose target manifolds are kahler g/h manifolds cannot be obtained from linear

sigma models [6]. (see also ref. [7] and appendix b for a review.) according to

this theorem, there must exist at least one qng bosons in eective eld theories

obtained from linear sigma models.

on the other hand, it is known that sigma models on some kahler g/h mani-

folds, namely on cp n or on the grassmann manifold gn,m (c), are obtained by the

introduction of gauge symmetry [12, 20, 21, 22]. the implicit assumption of lerche

and shore is the absence of gauge interactions in the linear sigma models. it seems

possible to eliminate unnecessary qng bosons if we introduce an appropriate gauge

symmetry.

in this paper, we show that supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models on a cer-

tain class of kahler g/h manifolds are obtained from linear sigma models with

gauge symmetry. we dene nonlinear sigma models by imposing supersymmetric

constraints on linear sigma models. we introduce two kinds of constraints, d-term

and f-term constraints. if we introduce auxiliary elds, these correspond to vector

and chiral superelds. vector auxiliary superelds appear as gauge elds. we suc-

cessfully formulate nonlinear sigma models on (irreducible and compact) hermitian

symmetric spaces1 classied by cartan as in table 1 [24].2

this paper is organized as follows. in sec. 2, we review simple cases without f-

term constraints, namely the projective space cp n1 and the grassmann manifold

gn,m (c). although these cases are known, it is instructive to discuss them with

emphasis on an interpretation in terms of ng and qng bosons.

in sec. 3, we

1 symmetric spaces are homogeneous spaces g/h with an involutive automorphism. since it

can be shown that any g-invariant dierential form  in a symmetric space is closed, d = 0, a

fundamental two form of a hermitian symmetric space is also closed, and this is kahlerian. hence,

the expression kahler symmetric space has the same meaning.

2 we use dimc for complex dimensions and dim for real dimensions.

the rst three manifolds, cp n 1, gn,m (c) and qn 2(c), are called a projective space, a grass-

mann manifold and a quadratic surface, respectively. the projective space cp n 1 and the grass-

mann manifold gn,m (c) are a set of complex lines and m dimensional complex planes in cn ,

respectively. bi (di) corresponds to odd (even) n . in the mathematical literature, eiii is written

as e6/spin(10)  u (1), since coset generators belong to the so(10) weyl spinor.

generalize to other hermitian symmetric spaces by introducing f-term constraints

in addition to d-term constraints. results in this section are new. as a by-product,

we nd explicit expressions of holomorphic constraints to embed g/h into cp n

or gn,m (c). sec. 4 is devoted to conclusions and discussion. we discuss how the

results can be generalized to an arbitrary kahler g/h manifold. in appendix a,

we review the construction of the kahler potentials for kahler g/h using bkmu

and ikk methods, in the case of hermitian symmetric spaces. in appendix b, we

review the theorem of lerche and shore. appendices c, d and e are devoted to

summaries of so, e6 and e7 algebras.

in the rest of this section, we introduce the notation and terminology used in

this paper.

the linear description of the nonlinear sigma model without a gauge symmetry

is given by

l = z d4 +(cid:18)z d20g() + c.c.(cid:19) ,

(1.1)

3

where the chiral supereld  belongs to an irreducible representation of the global

symmetry group g, and 0 is an auxiliary chiral supereld. the absence of kinetic

term of 0 corresponds to the strong coupling limit of the yukawa theory. although

the superpotential w = 0g() is g-invariant, 0 and g() need not be g-invariant

separately. instead, they may have indices transforming as a non-trivial representa-
tion of g, such as w = 0ig()i. if we integrate over the auxiliary eld 0, we obtain
f-term constraints, g() = 0, which are holomorphic functions. therefore, the f-

term constraints are invariant under the larger group gc, the complex extension of

g .

let the number of f-term constraints be nf. if it is suciently large, the target
manifold m becomes a gc-orbit of the vacuum v = hi. let the complex isotropy
group of the vacuum be h ( hv = v). then, the target manifold of the nonlinear

sigma model is parameterized by the chiral superelds corresponding to complex
broken generators in gc  h.3 therefore m is a complex coset space, m  gc/ h,
generated by these broken generators. as an example, let us consider a doublet
 =   1
2! of g = su(2) and suppose that they acquire the vacuum expectation
values v =   1
0 0! satises
+v = 0, it is the complex unbroken generator in h. on the other hand, 3 and the
lowering operator (= +) are the elements of the broken generators in gc  h.
there are two kinds of broken generators: the hermitian broken generator x

0!. since the raising operator + = 1

2(1 + i2) =   0 1

and the non-hermitian broken generator e.4 the superelds corresponding to non-

hermitian and hermitian generators are called pure-type and mixed-type superelds,
in the previous example, where the representative of gc/ h
respectively [5, 6].
is given by  = exp i(33 + )  v, 3 is a mixed-type and  is a pure-type
supereld. the scalar components of the mixed-type multiplets consist of a qng

boson in addition to a ng boson, whereas those of the pure-type multiplets consist
of two genuine ng bosons. since the vacuum is invariant under h, we can multiply

3 we use the calligraphic font for a lie algebra corresponding to a lie group.

the hermitian conjugate of e. they constitute the so-called borel subalgebra b in h [5].

the representative of the coset manifold by an arbitrary element of h from the
right. in our previous example, we can rewrite it as exp i(33 + 1 + 2)  v
by multiplying an appropriate factor generated by + for suciently small |3| and
||. the ng-bosons parameterizing s3  su(2) are 3, ,  , whereas 3 is
the qng-boson parameterizing the radius of s3. the number of chiral superelds

parameterizing the target manifold is

n = dimc v  nf = nm + np,

(1.2)

where v is the representation space. the numbers of the mixed-type and pure-type

multiplets are denoted by nm and np, respectively.

the directions parameterized by qng bosons are non-compact, whereas those

of ng bosons are compact.5 from the theorem of lerche and shore (see appendix

b), there exists at least one mixed-type multiplet, and therefore the target manifold

m becomes non-compact. since no two points in the non-compact direction can be
connected by the compact isometry group g, m is also non-homogeneous.

we rewrite the groups g and h dened above as g and h, and therefore
m  gc/ h. in order to eliminate the degree of freedom of qng bosons, we elevate
the subgroup of g to a local gauge symmetry. we assume g is the direct product
of a global symmetry and the gauge symmetry ggauge; that is g = gggauge, where
ggauge = u(1) or u(n). the gauged linear lagrangian can be written as

l = z d4(cid:16)ev   cv(cid:17) +(cid:18)z d20g() + c.c.(cid:19) ,

(1.3)

where 0 and v are auxiliary chiral and vector superelds. the absence of the

kinetic term of the gauge eld corresponds to the strong coupling limit, where the

gauge coupling constant tends to innity. here, for simplicity, the gauge group is

assumed to be u(1). (see sec. 2.2 for the non-abelian case.) integration over 0
gives the f-term constraint to dene the non-compact manifold m, as discussed
above. the integration over v gives a d-term constraint that restricts m to the
compact manifold m = m/gc

gauge [21], whose dimension is

(1.4)
5 we use the word compactness in the sense of topology. the kinetic terms of qng bosons

dimc m = n  dim ggauge.

have the same sign as those of ng bosons.

5

since we introduce gauge elds to absorb all mixed type multiplets,6 the dimension

of the gauge group and the compact manifold m are

dim ggauge = nm,

dimc m = np.

(1.5)

the compact manifold m is parameterized by only pure-type multiplets.

2 nonlinear sigma models without the f-term

constraint

although examples in this section are well known [21], we describe them in de-

tail, since the interpretation in terms of ng and qng bosons is useful to nd the

nonlinear sigma models on other compact manifolds.

2.1 projective space: cp n1 = su (n )/s(u (n  1)  u (1))
def= g  u(1)d.
we consider the global symmetry g = u(n) = su(n)  u(1)d
below, the phase symmetry u(1)d is gauged, while g = su(n) remains global. we
prepare the fundamental elds ~  n, which acquire a vacuum expectation value.
first of all, we consider the canonical kahler potential

k(~, ~ ) = ~ ~.

(2.1)

for later purposes, we decompose g = su(n) under the subgroup su(n1)u(1).
a fundamental representation n is decomposed as n = (n  1, 1)  (1,n + 1),
where the second factors are u(1) charges. hence, we decompose the elds as
~ =   x
yi! (i = 1,   , n  1). generators of su(n) can also be decomposed into
the su(n  1) generators ta (a = 1,   , n 2  2n), the u(1) generator t , the
n  1 raising operators ei represented by upper triangle matrices, and the lowering
6 the supersymmetric higgs mechanism acts as follows: a vector supereld absorbs one mixed-

type multiplet to constitute a massive vector multiplet. if it absorbs a pure-type multiplet, one

ng boson remains massless. they cannot constitute a massive vector multiplet, and the super-

symemtry is spontaneously broken [31].

operators represented by lower triangle matrices ei = (ei). the transformation
law of ~ under the complexied group su(n)c is

(2.2)

where (ta) is an n  1 by n  1 matrix for the fundamental representation of
2 = tr t 2 = tr eiei = 2 (no
su(n  1). we normalized these generators as tr ta
sum). when  =  and , a  r, this transformation law reduces to that of the
real group su(n). the u(1)d transformation is generated by td = 1n .

when ~ acquires a vacuum expectation value, it can be transformed by gc to

the standard form,

~v = d~e =   1
0! .

(2.3)

by this vacuum, the global symmetry is spontaneously broken down as u(n) 
u(n1) = su(n1)u(1) def= h. here, u(1) is generated by t   diag(0, 1,   , 1),
which is a linear combination of td and t . the complex isotropy group h, which
leaves ~v invariant, is larger than hc, since upper triangle generators ei annihilate
the vacuum ~v. here, ei generators constitute a borel subalgebra b in h. on the
other hand, the complex broken generators are the lower triangle generators ei and
the diagonal generator x = (1, 0,   , 0), which is also a linear combination of t and
td. the non-hermitian generators ei are pure-type generators, and the hermitian
generator x is a mixed-type generator. the target manifold m of the nonlinear
sigma model is a complex coset manifold m  gc/ h generated by these complex
broken generators. since, by using its representative  = exp(i ei + ix), the
elds can be written as ~ = ~v, its form near the vacuum is

~v = (ix + i ei)~v =   i
i! .

(2.4)

we thus nd that  is a mixed-type chiral supereld, whose scalar components are

ng and qng bosons, while the i are pure-type chiral superelds, whose scalar

components are both ng bosons. then the numbers of mixed-type and pure-type

7

chiral superelds are nm = 1 and np = n  1, respectively. this kahler manifold
is non-compact and non-homogeneous due to the existence of the qng boson.

to construct a compact homogeneous manifold, we wish to eliminate the qng

boson (the mixed-type multiplet). hence, we gauge the u(1)d symmetry by in-

troducing a vector supereld v , which will absorb the mixed-type multiplet. the

gauged kahler potential is [31]

k(~, ~ , v ) = ev ~ ~  cv,

(2.5)

where cv is a fayet-iliopoulos (fi) d-term [21, 31]. since the transformation law

of v is

ev  ev 

= ev ei(),

ei  u(1)d,

(2.6)

where  is a chiral supereld, the kahler potential (2.5) is invariant under the
c. note that the global symmetry

complex extension of the gauge symmetry, u(1)d

g = su(n) cannot be complexied. the equation of motion of v is

k/v = ev ~ ~  c = 0.

from this equation, v can be solved as

v (~, ~ ) =  log


~ ~

c 
 .

(2.7)

(2.8)

to eliminate the gauge eld, we substitute v (~, ~ ) back into eq. (2.5), obtaining

k(~, ~ , v (~, ~ )) = c log(~ ~),

(2.9)

where we have omitted constant terms.7 since we have the gauge symmetry u(1)d

c,

we can x the gauge as

~ =   1

i! .

(2.10)

7 their contributions to the lagrangian vanish as a result of the d4 integration.

8

by comparing eqs. (2.4) and (2.10), we nd that the mixed-type chiral supereld has

been eliminated by this gauge xing. the gauge xed eld (2.10) can be rewritten

as

~ = ~v,

 = e e =   1

0

i 1n1! ,

(2.11)

where  can be considered as a representative of a complex coset manifold gc/ h 
g/h = su(n)/s(u(n  1)  u(1)). since this is a compact homogeneous kahler
manifold, we have obtained the desired result. to obtain a compact manifold, gauge

elds are necessary. by substituting eq. (2.10) into eq. (2.9), we obtain

k(, , v (, )) = c log(1 + ||2).

(2.12)

this is the well-known kahler potential of the fubini-study metric for cp n1 =
su(n)/s(u(n  1)  u(1)).

2.2 grassmann manifold: gn,m (c) = u (n )/u (n  m) u (m)

this subsection is a generalization of the last subsection. the picture of ng and
qng bosons is discussed in ref. [22]. we consider a global symmetry g = gl 
gr = u(n)lu(m)r (n > m). the basic elds are   (n, m), which are n m
matrix-valued chiral superelds. the transformation law of  under gc is8

   = g   def= glgr1,

g = (gl, gr)  gc
where gl and gr are n  n and m  m matrices, respectively.

the kahler potential is canonical:

k(, ) = tr ().

any vacuum can be transformed under gc to

v = hi =   1m

0 ! ,

,

(2.13)

(2.14)

(2.15)

8 the conjugate representation ~  n is dened to transform as ~  (g1)t ~, since the group

is extended to its complexication and we must preserve the chirality.

where 1m is the m  m identity matrix and 0 is the (n  m)  m zero ma-
trix. the global symmetry is spontaneously broken as u(n)l  u(m)r  u(n 
m)l  u(m)v. here, u(n  m)l is the group generated by    0m 0
t ! , 0m! 
(gl,gr), where t are (n  m)  (n  m) matrices, and u(m)v is generated by
   t
0 0nm ! , t!  (gl,gr), where t are mm matrices. the complex isotropy
h that leaves hi invariant is larger than hc by e def=    0m
0nm ! , 0m!,
where t are m  (n  m) matrices. here, these e constitute a borel subalgebra b
of h, and its dimension is dimc b = m(n  m). on the other hand, the complex
broken generators consist of non-hermitian generators, e def=    0m
0nm ! , 0m!,
which are hermitian conjugates of e, and hermitian generators, x def=    t
0 0nm ! ,t!,

which are elements of an axial symmetry u(m)a. the target manifold is a complex
coset manifold m  gc/ h, and its representative is  = exp(  e + i  x) def=
(l, r). the eld can be written as ~ =   v = lv r1. its form near the
vacuum is

v =   2i
 ! .

(2.16)

here,  is an m  m matrix chiral supereld considered as mixed types and 
is an (n  m)  m matrix chiral supereld considered as pure types. hence,
the numbers of mixed-type and pure-type chiral superelds are nm = m 2 and
np = m(n  m)(= dimc b), respectively.

to absorb the m 2 mixed-type chiral superelds, we gauge u(m)r by introducing
m 2 vector superelds v = v ata, where ta represents generators of u(m)r. the

gauged kahler potential is

k(, , v ) = tr (ev )  c tr v,

(2.17)

where c tr v is a fayet-iliopoulos d-term. since the vector superelds are trans-

formed as

ev  ev 

= grev gr,

10

(2.18)

the gauged kahler potential is invariant under the complexied gauge symmetry

gr

c. to eliminate vector superelds, we use the equation of motion of v ,9

then v can be solved as

k/v = ev  c1m = 0.

v (, ) =  log  
c ! .

by substituting this into eq. (2.17), we obtain

(2.19)

(2.20)

k(, , v (, )) = c tr log() = c log det(),

(2.21)

where we have omitted constant terms. we choose the gauge xing as

 =   1m

 ! ,

(2.22)

where  is an (nm)m matrix-valued chiral supereld. by comparing eq. (2.16)
and eq. (2.22), we nd that all mixed-type multiplets  have disappeared by this
gauge xing condition. when  is a representative of gc/ h = u(n)/u(n  m) 
u(m),  can be rewritten as

 =   v = lv r1,

 = e e =    1m



0

1nm ! , 1m! = (l, r).

(2.23)

since the target space m is parameterized solely by pure-type multiplets, it is a

compact homogeneous kahler manifold. by substituting eq. (2.22) into eq. (2.21),

we obtain the kahler potential of m:

k(, , v (, )) = c log det(1m + ).

(2.24)

this is the kahler potential of the grassmann manifold gn,m = u(n)/u(n m)
u(m) [3].

9 we treat ev ev as an innitesimal parameter, since tr (ev ) = tr (ev (ev ev )).

the second term is obtained from tr ( log x) = tr (x 1x), where x = ev .

3 nonlinear sigma models with f-term constraints

only d-term constraints appeared in the last two examples. in this section we also

introduce appropriate f-term constraints to dene other kahlerian g/h manifolds.

3.1 so(n )/so(n  2)  u (1)
we consider a global symmetry, g = so(n)  u(1)d = g  u(1)d. we will gauge
u(1)d symmetry later. the elds, which develop a vacuum expectation value, are ~
in the dening representation n of so(n). the u(1)d charge of ~ is dened to be 1.
the fundamental representation is decomposed under its subgroup so(n2)u(1)
as n = (n  2, 0)  (1, 1)  (1,1). here, the second factor is the u(1) charge.
the elds can be written as

~ = 


x

yi

z




,

(3.1)

where x, yi (i = 1,   , n  2) and z are a scalar, a vector and a scalar of so(n  2),
respectively. their u(1) charges are dened above. so(n) is dened as the group

that leaves the quadratic form

ventional way (see appendix c):

j =

(3.3)

the generators of so(n) consist of the so(n2) generator tij (i, j = 1,   , n2),
the u(1) generator t , and the upper triangular matrices ei (i = 1,   , n2), which
transform as (n  2, 1), and their complex conjugates ei = (ei) in (n  2,1).
so(n)c acts on the fundamental representation in our basis as

where i
ij =
tr t 2 = tr ei ei = 2 (no sum). all parameters are complex when we consider
so(n)c and real when we consider so(n).

in order to impose the global symmetry so(n)  u(1)d, we introduce the su-

perpotential

w (0, ~) = 0~ 2,

(3.5)

with the lagrange multiplier eld 0. this is an so(n) singlet, and its u(1)d charge
is dened to be 2, so that w is invariant under g. since the superpotential is a
holomorphic function of  and 0, the symmetry is enhanced to its complexcation
c. we can eliminate the auxiliary eld by using its equation
gc = so(n)cu(1)d
of motion, 10

w/0 = i2 = 2xz + y2 = 0.

(3.6)

we thus obtain an f-term constraint (nf = 1). this equation is immediately solved

to give

then, the eld ~ constrained by the f-term can be written as

z =

when this develops a vacuum expectation value, any vacuum can be transformed
by gc to the standard form,

~v = d~e =   1
0! .

(3.9)

0 + ~  ~ and
|~ 2|2 + |0|2|~|2. we obtain the f-term constraint in

w = 0 ~ 2, then the potential reads v = 1
the limit   0.

13

by this vacuum expectation value, the global symmetry is spontaneously broken
as so(n)  u(1)d  so(n  2)  u(1), where the unbroken u(1) is generated
by a linear combination of the u(1) subgroup and u(1)d.11 the complex broken

generators consist of x, which is hermitian and generates a mixed-type multiplet,

and the ei, which are non-hermitian and generate pure-type multiplets. then, the
number of the mixed- and pure-type multiplets are nm = 1 and np = n  2,
respectively. the target manifold m generated by these generators is non-compact

and non-homogeneous due to the presence of the qng boson. the eld near ~v is

~v = (ix + i ei)~v =

where  is a mixed-type multiplet and i are pure-type multiplets.

we elevate u(1)d to a local gauge symmetry to obtain a compact manifold by
eliminating the mixed-type multiplet, as in the case of cp n1. the gauged kahler

potential is the same as eq. (2.5). by integrating out the auxiliary superelds, we
obtain eq. (2.9), with the constraint ~ 2 = 0. by using the gauge symmetry u(1)d
c,
we can choose the gauge xing as x = 1:

(3.11)

here we have rewritten yi as i. this ~ can be rewritten by using the representative
11 note that the condition i2 = 0 is essential to introduce the gauge symmetry. to impose
i2 = f 2 6= 0, we have to use w = g0(i2  f 2). in this case there is no u (1)d symmetry, and
there is a supersymmetric vacuum alignment [9, 10]. thus the unbroken global symmetry h can
depend on the choice of the vacuum expectation value: h = so(n  1) at the symmetric points,
where  = f 2, and h = so(n  2) at the non-symmetric points, where  > f 2. whereas
i2 = 0 corresponds to an open orbit, i2 6= 0 corresponds to closed orbits. in general, in closed
orbits, there is a supersymmetric vacuum alignment. (see, e.g., subsec. 3.3 for the e6 case.) in

this paper, we do not discuss closed orbits, since we cannot gauge the u (1)d symmetry.

this is exactly the kahler potential of so(n)/so(n  2)  u(1) [13, 23, 10].

in our derivation of the kahler potential, we used the d-term constraint after

imposing the f-term constraint rst. instead, we could impose the d-term constraint

rst. if we do so, we obtain the previous cp n1 model. the f-term constraint is
used as the holomorphic embedding condition of qn2(c) = so(n)/so(n  2) 
u(1) to cp n1. it is a well-known method to obtain qn2(c) in the mathematical

literature [24]. (see also p. 278 of ref. [25].)

3.2 so(2n )/u (n ) and sp(n )/u (n )

in this subsection, we consider the global symmetry g = gl  gr, where gl is
either so(2n) or sp(n) and gr = u(n)r, which will be gauged later. to embed
gl into a 2n  2n matrix of u(2n), we write its elements by using four n  n
matrices:

g =   a b

c d!  u(2n).

this is an element of so(2n) or sp(n) if it satises

gt jg = j,

where j is the invariant tensor of so(2n) or sp(n):

j =   0

(3.16)

here  = +1 corresponds to so(2n) and  = 1 to sp(n). equation (3.15) can be
written explicitly as

  at c + c t a at d + c t b
bt c + dt a bt d + dt c! =   0

1n

1n

0 ! .

(3.17)

we consider the global symmetry as either g = so(2n)l  u(n)r for  = +1
or g = sp(n)l  u(n)r for  = 1. the eld content is   (2n, n), which
acquires a vacuum expectation value. its transformation law under g is

   = g   = glgr1,

g = (gl, gr)  gl  gr

(3.18)

the gc invariant superpotential is

w (0, ) = tr (0t j),

(3.19)

where 0 is an n  n auxiliary matrix chiral supereld, whose transformation law
is

0  gr0gr

t .

(3.20)

since i2 def= t j is symmetric (anti-symmetric) for  = 1 ( = 1), 0 satises
(3.21)

t = 0.

0

hence, 0 belongs to a symmetric (anti-symmetric) rank-2 tensor representation of
su(n)r for  = 1 ( = 1), and its u(1)d( u(n)r) charge is dened to be 2
to cancel with the  charge. note that i2 = t j is invariant under gl, but not
invariant under gr

to eliminate the auxiliary eld 0, we solve its equation of motion

w/0 = t j = 0.

(3.22)

we thereby obtain f-term constraints for the elds . their number is nf =
2n(n + 1) for  = 1 and nf = 1
1
2n(n  1) for  = 1. then the dimension of
the resulting manifold m constrained by the f-term is n = 2n 2  1
2n(n + 1) =
2n 2  1
2n for  = 1. when

the eld  acquires a vacuum expectation value, any vacuum can be transformed
by gc to the standard form,

v = hi =   1n

0n ! .

(3.23)

hence, the f-term constrained manifold is a gc-orbit of v . the breaking pattern
of the global symmetry is either so(2n)lu(n)r  u(n)v for  = 1 or sp(n)l
u(n)r  u(n)v for  = 1. here, in both cases, the element of u(n)v can be
written as

0

   h

0 h1t ! , h!  u(n)v,

(3.24)

where we have used eq. (3.17). the complex isotropy group h consists of complex

extension of these elements and elements of the type

   1n b

0n 1n ! , 1n! def= ee,

e =    0n b

0n 0n ! , 0n! ,

with the constraints, from eq. (3.17),

b + bt = 0.

(3.25)

(3.26)

these e constitute a borel subalgebra b of h. the dimensionality of b is dimc b =
2n(n  1) for  = +1 and dimc b = 1
2n(n + 1) for  = 1. the pure-type broken
generators are the complex conjugation of e  b: e = (e).

to obtain a compact coset manifold, we gauge the u(n)r symmetry by introduc-

ing vector superelds, as in the grassmann manifold. the gauged kahler potential

is the same as eq. (2.17), but with f-term constraints. since the procedure of in-

tegrating out the gauge elds is also the same as for the grassmann manifold, we

obtain eq. (2.21). we can choose the gauge xing as

 =   1m

 ! ,

where  satises the f-term constraints eq. (3.22):

t j =  + t = 0.

17

(3.27)

(3.28)

the elds  are all pure-type chiral superelds, since  is generated by the pure-type
broken generators e from the vacuum v :

 =   v,

 = e e =    1n 0n

1n ! , 1n! .



(3.29)

here, from eq. (3.17),  satises  + t = 0, which is consistent with (3.28). by

substituting eq. (3.27) into eq. (2.21), we obtain the kahler potential

k(, , v (, )) = c log det(1n + ),

 + t = 0.

(3.30)

the elds  are anti-symmetric (symmetric) parts of the matrix chiral supereld of
the grassmann manifold g2n,n for  = +1 (1). their dimensions are dimc m =
2n(n  1) for  = +1 and dimc m = 1
2n(n + 1) for  = 1. again, it is well-
known that these manifolds are submanifolds of the grassmann manifold g2n,n in

the mathematical literature [24].

3.3 e6/so(10)  u (1)

this and the next subsections are devoted to the gauge theory construction of

exceptional-type hermitian symmetric spaces. the situation here is slightly dierent

from the classical group cases. namely, in the present case, an f-term constrained

manifold m is characterized by the derivative of a g-invariant (i = 0), but not

the g-invariant itself (i = 0), as in the case of classical types.

as in the qn2(c) case, we consider the global symmetry g = e6  u(1)d =
g  u(1)d. the eld belongs to the fundamental representation of e6: ~  27,
which will acquire a vacuum expectation value. we decompose e6 under its maximal
subgroup so(10) u(1). since the fundamental representation can be decomposed
as 27 = (1, 4)(16, 1)(10,2) [27], where the second entries are the u(1) charges,
the basic eld ~ can be written as

here, x, y ( = 1,   , 16) and za (a = 1,   , 10) are an so(10) scalar, a weyl
spinor and a vector, respectively. the decomposition of the adjoint representation,

the decomposition of the tensor product, 27 27 = 27s  , implies that there

(3.33)

(3.34)

here ~0 represents auxiliary elds whose u(1)d charges should be chosen so as to
make the superpotential invariant. if we assign the u(1)d charge 1 to ~, ~0 must
have charge 2, so that they belong to (27,2). the equations of motion for the

w/x0 = 0jkjk = z2 = 0.

in the second equation, we have used the fact that (ca) is symmetric. note

that these equations can also be written as

i3 = 0,

(3.38)

where the dierentiation is with respect to i. in these 27 equations, only the rst

10 equations are independent. the rst equation can be solved to yield

za =

y(ca)y.

(3.39)

then, the last two equations are not independent, since they are automatically

satised as

with the help of the identity

(ca)(ca) =

(ca)(ca).

(3.42)

hence, the number of f-term conditions is nf = 10, and the dimension of m is
n = 27  10 = 17. the manifold m satisfying these f-term constraints can be
written as

and so(10) is generated by tab. the complex isotropy h is larger than the com-
plexication of h due to the existence of the e. these 16 e constitute a borel
subalgebra b in h. the complex broken generators are composed of pure-type gen-
erators e and another combination of u(1) generators of a mixed-type x  (1,  ).
their numbers are np = 16 and nm = 1, respectively. the target manifold m gen-
erated by these broken generators has dimension dim m = n = 17. since this

coincides with the dimension of the manifold constrained by the 10 independent

f-term conditions, any vacuum that satises f-term constraints can be transformed
to the form of eq. (3.45) by a gc transformation.

to remove the mixed-type multiplet and to obtain a compact manifold, we gauge
the u(1)d symmetry as in the case of cp n1. the gauged kahler potential is the

same as in eq. (2.5). since the procedure to eliminate the vector supereld is also

the same as in the cp n1 case, we obtain eq. (2.9). we can choose a gauge xing

to ref. [14].) its dimension is dimc m = 27  10  1 = 16. if we do not introduce
the superpotential, the manifold is cp 26. hence, e6/so(10) u(1) is embedded in
cp 26 by 10 f-term constraints, i3 = 0. in fact, yasui constructed e6/so(10) 
u(1) as a submanifold of cp 26 by using the jordan algebra [16].

3.4 e7/e6  u (1)
in this subsection, we consider another exceptional group, e7. the global symmetry
in this case is g = e7 u(1)d = g u(1)d. the basic elds ~ belong to the funda-

(3.60)

we can show that these equations are not independent of eqs. (3.59) with the help of

the springer relation, eq. (d.6). then the number of f-term constraints is nf = 28,

on these points, the value of the e7 invariant is

(3.61)

(3.62)

where we have used the springer relation (d.6). note that u(1)d invariance requires

i4 = 0.

by using gc, any vacuum expectation value of ~ can be transformed to

~v = d~e =   1
0! .

(3.63)

on this vacuum, global symmetry is spontaneously broken as e7  u(1)d  e6 
u(1) def= h. here u(1) is generated by a linear combination of the u(1) generator

t and the u(1)d generator td = 156. from eq. (3.50), we see that the complex
isotropy h is larger than hc due to the presence of the ei, which constitute a
borel subalgebra. the complex broken generators constitute a hermitian generator
x, which is a linear combination of td and t , and non-hermitian generators ei.
hence, the numbers of mixed- and pure-type multiplets are nm = 1 and np = 27,
respectively. the target manifold m is generated by these broken generators, and
its dimension is dimc m = 28, which coincides with the dimension of the manifold

constrained by the f-term conditions in eq. (3.61).

the target manifold m obtained above is non-compact due to the qng boson.

we gauge the u(1)d symmetry to remove the mixed-type multiplet and to obtain
a compact manifold. since the situation is the same as for the cp n1, qn2(c)
and e6/so(10)  u(1) cases, by integrating out the vector supereld, we obtain

25

eq. (2.9). we can choose the gauge xing as

hence the target manifold m, obtained by integrating out the vector supereld,
is the coset manifold generated by ei, which is m  e7/e6  u(1). then, by

this form coincides with ref. [13]. its dimension is dimc m = 56  28  1 = 27. it
can be embedded into cp 55 by holomorphic constraints i4 = 0.

4 conclusions and discussion

we have obtained nonlinear sigma models whose target manifolds are the hermitian

symmetric spaces g/h, which are compact and homogeneous, from linear models.

for this purpose, we introduced appropriate superpotentials for g = so, su, sp, e6

and e7 to impose f-term constraints. by solving these f-term constraint equa-
tions, we have obtained constrained manifolds m, which are non-compact and

non-homogeneous due to the existence of qng bosons. when there is no gauge

symmetry, there must be at least one qng boson, by the theorem of lerche and

shore [6], and the manifold inevitably becomes non-compact and non-homogeneous

(see appendix b). in order to get rid of these unwanted qng-bosons, we further in-

troduced suitable local gauge symmetry. by choosing suitable gauge conditions, we

26

obtained the kahler potentials of all the hermitian symmetric spaces, where decay

constants (overall constants of kahler potentials) originate from fi-terms of gauge

elds.

the gauging procedures to eliminate qng bosons can be summarized as fol-

the left-hand sides denote the f-term constrained manifolds m (if there is a su-
perpotential). all m are non-compact and non-homogeneous, due to the existence
of qng bosons represented by r+. this implies that they are scale factors. the

arrows represent the gauging and the right hand sides denote the manifold m ob-

tained by integrating out the vector superelds. the relation between m and m is a
kahler quotient, m = m/gc
gauge. all m are compact and homogeneous, since they
are parameterized by only ng bosons. in the cases of cp n1 and gn,m , there are
no f-term constraints. other cases have gc-invariants, superpotentials and f-term

constraints, as summarized in table 2.

15 from the result in ref. [9], in all cases considered in this paper, we know that there exists no

supersymmetric vacuum alignment, since there is no non-singlet broken generators under the real
unbroken subgroup h. hence, the f-term constrained manifolds m   gc/ h  are topologically
isomorphic to direct products of a qng boson factor r+ = {|  r,  > 0}, which is non-compact,
and a ng bosons factor g/h , which is compact. for example, in the case of cn without an
f-term constraint, m   gc/ h  = (su(n )u(1)d)c

(su(n 1)u(1))cb  r+ su(n )u(1)d

here, j, j ,  and d are rank-2, rank-2, rank-3 and rank-4 invariant symmetric tensors of so(n ),

so(2n ) or sp(n ), e6 and e7, respectively, and i2, i2

, i3 and i4 are gc-invariants composed

of them. each superpotential gives an f-term constraint, which is i = 0 in the case of classical

groups and i = 0 in the case of exceptional groups. only 10 equations of the 27 equations are

independent in the e6 case, and only 28 equations among 56 equations are independent in the

e7 case. the last column denotes the projective or grassmann manifold, in which each hermitian

symmetric space is embedded by the f-term constraint.

the f-term constraints can be classied into two types:

 g = so, sp: i = 0. (they are gc-invariant.)
 g = e6, e7: i = 0. (although the i are not gc-invariant, the constraints

themselves are gc-invariant.)

in each case, the value of the gc-invariant vanishes on the constrained manifolds,

since, even in the cases of the exceptional groups, the constraints i = 0 lead to

i = 0. this remarkable fact can be understood as follows: note that, in each case,

the gc-invariant i is not invariant under a gauge group. hence, it must vanish to

be consistent with a gauge symmetry. we call this the consistency condition with

a gauge symmetry.16
by gauging u (1), we obtain gc/ h  g/h = cp n 1.
16 by combining the result in ref. [10], this condition can be understood as the condition that

the manifold before gauging must be an open orbit, not a closed orbit. in ref. [10], it was shown

that an open orbit includes a compact and homogeneous manifold as a submanifold. contrastingly,

a closed orbit does not have such a submanifold.

28

if we forget the f-term constraints and impose only the d-term constraints, the
manifolds become cp n1 or g2n,n . this means that all of the hermitian symmetric
spaces are holomorphically embedded in cp n1 or gn,m by f-term constraints, as

is shown in the last column of table 2. although some of the constraints are already

known in the mathematical literature, the explicit forms of the constraints in the
e6 and e7 cases are new results: e6/so(10)  u(1) is holomorphically embbedded
in cp 26 by 16 quadratic homogeneous constraints, and e7/e6  u(1) is embedded
in cp 55 by 28 tripletic homogeneous constraints. the consistency condition with

a gauge symmetry can be understood if we interpret the f-term constraints as

the embedding conditions. since gn,m can be embedded into cp n , all hermitian
if we want to embed m into cp n ,
symmetric spaces are embedded in cp n .

the constraint must be homogeneous, when it is written in terms of homogeneous

coordinates.17

in this paper, we have used the equation of motion for the vector auxiliary eld.

in the path integral formalism, this procedure corresponds to integrating over the

vector eld.

in a separate paper [26], we show that the path integration can be

performed exactly.

now we discuss possible generalizations of our results to wider class of kahlerian

g/h. in this paper, we treated hermitian symmetric spaces, which are a special

class of homogeneous kahler manifolds. we conned ourselves to the gauge groups

of u(1) or u(n).

1. even within this limitation, it is possible to generalize our construction to a

wider class of homogeneous kahler manifolds. let us consider kahler g/h,
where h has only one u(1) factor, h = hssu(1), with hss being a semisimple
subgroup of h. to be specic, let us generalize so(2n)/u(n). by general-
izing  to a 2n  m matrix (n  m), transforming under so(2n)  u(m)
as   glgr1, with the same superpotential (3.19) (where j is the same as
17 the manifold, which can be embedded into cp n , is a (projective) algebraic variety and can

be understood as a hodge manifold.

29

in eq. (3.16)), we obtain

(r+)m 2



so(2n)l  u(m)r

so(2n  2m)l  u(m)v

u (m )r

so(2n)l

so(2n  2m)l  u(m)l

.

this reduces to so(2n)/so(2n2)u(1) when m = 1 and to so(2n)/u(n)
when n = m. similarly, sp(n)/u(n) can also be generalized. by generaliz-
ing  to a 2n  m matrix (n  m), we obtain
u (m )r

sp(n)l  u(m)r

sp(n)l

(r+)m 2



sp(n  m)l  u(m)v

sp(n  m)l  u(m)l

.

2. now we consider generalization to the case of many u(1) factors. remember

that the fi parameter c becomes a decay constant, which represents the size of

g/h, after integrating out the vector supereld. then, we can consider there

the be a one-to-one correspondence between the decay constants and the fi-
parameters. hence, to obtain g/h with h = hss  u(1)n we must prepare n
fi-parameters. we thus consider a global symmetry, g = g  g1     gn,
where each gi includes a u(1) factor. if we gauge all gi, the gauged kahler

potential has n fi terms. after integrating out vector superelds, we obtain
g/h  g1     gn = g/hss  u(1)n, where h is the remaining part after
embedding all gi into g. here we have put hss = h  g1ss     gnss. in
the case of hermitian symmetric spaces, we have introduced an irreducible

representation of g as the basic eld. it seems that we have to introduce more

irreducible representations in these generalizations. then we must impose

orthogonality relations on these elds with d-term or f-term constraints. at

the moment, we are unable to nd consistent constraints in these cases.

a bkmu-ikk construction of kahler potentials

of compact homogeneous kahler manifolds

bando et al. (bkmu) gave the general method to construct the g invariant kahler
potential of gc/ h [5]. however, there remained an ambiguity in the choice of the

projection operators i introduced below, eq. (a.1). itoh et al. (ikk) constructed
these operators explicitly for the case that the target is compact, namely gc/ h 
g/h [11]. note that their method does not ensure that such models can be obtained

from linear models. in this appendix, we review their method to compare with our

method, which, on the other hand, has a linear origin.

first of all, we need the projection matrices, which project a fundamental rep-
resentation space onto a h invariant subspace [5]. they satisfy the projection con-

ditions

 = ,

 h = h,

2 = .

(a.1)

in an arbitrary kahler g/h, the numbers of projection matrices is equals to the

number of u(1) factors in h. since there is only one u(1) factor in the hermitian

symmetric cases, there is one projection matrix.

in each case, it can be written

as [11]

 =   1

0! .

(a.2)

by using this, the kahler potentials of compact kahler manifolds can be written

as [5]

k = c log det,

(a.3)

where  is a representative of the complex coset gc/ h. since the form of  can

be calculated as eqs. (2.11), (2.23), (3.12), (3.29), (3.47) and (3.65), they give the

same kahler potential obtained from linear models in this paper.

31

b the non-compactness theorem of lerche and

shore

the nonlinear sigma model, whose target manifold is compact and homogeneous, has

a unique kahler potential, as discussed in the last appendix [5, 11]. although these

models include neither a qng boson nor an arbitrariness in the kahler potential

and they are mathematically beautiful, they cannot be obtained from any linear

model, at least when there is no gauge symmetry: it was shown that there exists

at least one qng boson, and therefore the target must be non-compact and non-

homogeneous.

in this appendix, we review the theorem obtained by lerche and

shore [6] (see also ref. [7]).

the fact that the model has a linear origin implies that the target manifold

can be obtained from some f-term conditions (if there is no gauge symmetry).

since they are holomorphic equations, the invariance under the global symmetry g

enlarges to the complexication gc, and the manifold becomes a gc-orbit of the

vacuum expectation value v.18 the pure-type multiplets require that the real broken

generators are divided into complex unbroken and complex broken generators, ei
and ei(= (ei)). since ei is broken, we obtain

0 6= | eiv|2 = vhei, eii v = (i)avhav,

(b.1)

where (i)a is a root vector and ha is a cartan generator. therefore, at least one

cartan generator, ha, must be broken. since this is hermitian, there exists at least

one mixed-type generator, and therefore at least one qng boson.

c so(n ) algebra

since the basis of so(n) used in subsec. 3.1 is not in the standard form, here we

give its relation to the ordinary basis. the so(n) generators in the ordinary basis

18 if there are not enough f-term constraints, the manifold may become larger than a gc-orbit.

however, the proof is valid also in such cases, since they include at least one gc-orbit.

(c.5)

since u is a unitary matrix (uu = uu = 1), ~ ~ is invariant, and then log(~ ~)

also is invariant. by the unitary transformation, the vacuum expectation value is

transformed to the standard form,

second rank invariant tensor is transformed as ij  (uu t )ij = jij, where j is
dened in eq, (3.3).

d e6 algebra

in this appendix, we construct the e6 algebra by referring to refs. [15, 28].

d.1 construction of e6 algebra

since an adjoint representation is decomposed as 78 = (45, 0)  (1, 0)  (16, 1) 
( 16,1) [27], we construct the e6 algebra as e6 = so(10)  u(1)  16  16: we
prepare the so(10) generator tab, the u(1) generator t , 16 as e, and 16 as
e = (e). then their commutation relations can be calculated as follows [15, 28]:

[tab, tcd] = i(bctad + adtbc  actbd  bdtac),
[tab, e] = (ab)
[t, e] =

e,

symmetric property of the structure constants. the relative weight of the rst and

and the nontrivial identity for the spinor generators [15, 28],

invariant tensor of e6

from the tensor product [27] 27  27 = 27s    , we know there exists a rank-3
symmetric tensor invariant under e6. the components of ijk are [28]

0ab = ab,
a = 12(ca),
otherwise 0.

(d.3)

ijk = 


these components can be calculated as follows. first, construct the so(10) u(1)
invariant of order three:

i3 = axz2 +

1
2

zay(ca)y.

(d.4)

by the requirement of the invariance of e or e, we can conclude a = 1. (here

we have used the identity (3.42).) the components (d.3) can be read from this

invariant.

it is known that there is an identity [29] 19

ijkijl = 10l
k.

under the normalization in eq. (d.5), there is the springer relation [29]

ijk(jl{mno}k) = i{lmno},

(d.5)

(d.6)

where we have used the notation a{ij} = aij + aji +   . these identities are
used many times in the analysis of the e7 algebra.

19 in the calculation of ijaijb = 10ab, we have used the identity 24tr (ca

bc) =

ab [28].

35

e e7 algebra

in this appendix, we construct the e7 algebra in the same way as in the last ap-

pendix.

e.1 construction of e7 algebra

the decomposition of the adjoint representation of e7 under the maximal subgroup
e6  u(1) is 133 = (78, 0)  (1, 0)  (27, 1)  ( 27,1), where the second compo-
nents are the u(1) charges [27]. hence, we can construct the e7 algebra by adding
generators ei and ei(= (ei)) (i = 1,   , 27), which belong to the e6 fundamental
and anti-fundamental representations, respectively, to the e6  u(1) algebra, ta
(a = 1,   , 78) and t : e7 = e6  u(1)  27  27.
in the same manner as we
constructed the e6 algebra in the last appendix, their commutation relations are

obtained as follows:

[ta, tb] = ifab

ctc,

[ta, ei] = (ta)i

jej,

ei,

[t, ei] = s 2
[ei, ej] = [ ei, ej] = 0,

[ta, ei] = (ta)t
[t, ei] = s 2

[ei, ej] = (ta)i

(e.1)

here (ta) is a fundamental representation matrix, and the fab

c are structure

constants of e6, whose explicit forms were obtained in the last section. the u(1)
charge of ei is determined from the dierence of x and yi, etc., in eq. (3.50), and
ei is its conjugate. in the last equation, the coecient of the second term coincides
with the u(1) charge of ei due to the anti-symmetricity of the structure constants
of e7. the rst term is determined by the jacobi identity [ e, [e, e]] + (cyclic) = 0
and the nontrivial identity for the e6 fundamental representation [30],

a (ta)[i

this is satised when tr (ta)2 = 6.

e.2

invariant tensors of e7

from the tensor product of fundamental representations [27], 56  56 = 1a    
and 56  56  56  56 = 1s    , there exist the rank-2 anti-symmetric tensor
f and the rank-4 symmetric tensor d as e7 invariant tensors. to nd their
components, we construct a linear combination of e6  u(1) invariants of quartic
order and require invariance under e or e, as in the last appendix. the result is

i4 = d

(e.3)

here, i4 is invariant due to the springer relation for the e6 invariant tensor, eq. (d.6).

the components can be read from this invariant. since we do not use the anti-

symmetric tensor f, we do not construct it here.
