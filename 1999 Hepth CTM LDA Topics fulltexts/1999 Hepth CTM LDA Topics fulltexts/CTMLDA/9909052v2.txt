this paper is organized in three parts: in the rst section we briey review the pseudogap phe-
nomenon (separation of temperatures of pair formation and pair condensation) in strong - coupling
and low carrier density superconductors, in two dierent models. second part is a review of non-
linear sigma model approach to an analogous phenomenon in the chiral gross-neveu model at low
n. in the third section we observe however that this approach can not be generalized in principle
to nambujona-lasinio model. we also observe that a recent claim made by kleinert and van den
bossche [8] that njl does not posses chiral symmetry breakdown due to chiral uctuations is not
correct. this resolves numerous recent controversial discussions initiated by the above mentioned
paper. in conclusion we discuss possibility of formation of a phase analogous to pseudogap phase
in qcd, since precritical pairing uctuations and the pseudogap phase should be a general feature
of any fermi system with attraction. color superconductors should as well possess an analogous
phase.

i. introduction

many concepts of particle physics have a close relation to superconductivity, for example nambujona-lasinio
model [1]- [3] was proposed in analogy to bcs theory of superconductivity and is considered to be a low-energy
eective theory of qcd. recently there was a substantial development in a theory of superconductivity in systems
with strong attraction and low carrier density. namely it was observed that away from the limit of innitesimally weak
coupling strength or very high carrier density, bcs-like mean-eld theories are qualitatively wrong and these systems
possess along with superconductive phase an additional phase where there exist cooper pairs but no symmetry is
broken due to violent phase uctuations (pseudogap phase). what may be regarded as an indication of the importance
of this concept to particle physics is that recently the formation of the pseudogap phase due to dynamic quantum
uctuations at low n was found in the chiral gross-neveu model in 2 +  dimensions [4]. however in this paper we
show that no direct generalization of result [4] to njl model is possible.

separation of the temperatures of the pair formation and onset the of phase coherence (pair condensation) in strong-
coupling superconductors is in fact known already for many years (crossover from bcs superconductivity to  bose-
einstein condensation (bec) of tightly bound fermion pairs) [5,6]. extensive theoretical study of this phenomena in
the past several years (see for example [7], [11]- [18]), was sparked by experimental results on underdoped (low carrier
density) cuprates that display gap-like feature above critical temperature tc that disappears only at a substantially
higher temperature t . there is experimental evidence that this phenomenon in high-tc superconductors may be
connected with precritical pairing uctuations above tc. at present, this crossover has been studied by variety of
methods and in many dierent models.

due to intimate relation of many problems in particle physics to superconductivity it seems to be natural to guess

that pseudogap may become a fruitful concept in high energy physics too.

below we review this phenomena in superconductors and discuss its possible implications for qcd.

is mentioned in the introduction existence of a pseudogap in the spectrum of the normal state well above critical tem-
perature that from experimental point of view manifests itself as an essential suppression of low frequency spectral
weight thus being in contrast to exactly zero spectral weight in the case of superconductive gap. moreover spec-
troscopy experiments show that superconductive gap evolves smoothly by magnitude and wave vector dependence to
a pseudogap in normal state. except for it nmr and tunneling experiments indicate existence of incoherent cooper
pairs well above tc. in principle it is very easy to guess what is hidden behind this circumstances, and why bcs
theory is incapable to describe it. let us imagine for a moment that we were able to bind electrons in cooper pairs
innitely tightly - obviously this implies that characteristic temperature of thermal pair decomposition will be also
innitely high, however this does not imply that the long-range order will survive at innitely high temperatures.
as it was rst observed in [6], long-range order will be destroyed in a similar way as it happens say in superuid
4he i.e. tightly bound cooper pairs, at certain temperature will acquire a nonzero momentum and thus we will have
gas of tightly bound cooper pairs but no macroscopic occupation of zero momentum level q = 0 and with it no
long-range order. thus phase diagram of a strong coupling superconductor has three regions: (i) superconductive
phase where there are condensed fermion pairs, (ii) pseudogap phase where there exist fermion pairs but there is no
condensate and with it there is no symmetry breakdown and no superconductivity, (iii) normal phase with thermally
decomposed cooper pairs. of course, existence of bound pairs above critical temperature will result in deviations
from fermi-liquid behavior that makes pseudogap phase to be a very interesting object of study. in order to describe
superconductivity in a such system theory should incorporate pairs with nonzero momentum and thus bcs scenario
is invalid for description of spontaneous symmetry breakdown in a system with strong attractive interaction or low
carrier density (see [6], [7] and references therein). so in principle in a strong-coupling superconductor onset of long
range order has nothing to do with pair formation transition. existence of the paired fermions is only necessary but
not sucient condition for symmetry breakdown. bcs limit is a rather exotic case of innitesimally weak coupling
strength and high carrier density when the disappearance of superconductivity can approximately be described a as
pairbreaking transition. strong-coupling limit is another exotic case when temperatures of the pair decomposition
and symmetry breakdown can be arbitrarily separated. there is nothing surprising in it:
formally in the case of
bose condensation of 4he we can also introduce a characteristic temperature of thermal decomposition of the 4he
atom, however this would not mean that this temperature will be somehow related to the temperature of the bose
condensation of the gas of he atoms. schematic phase diagram of a superconductor is in shown in fig 1.

in the strong coupling limit,
temperature of superconductive phase transition tends to a plateau value corresponding to temperature of bose condensation
of the gas of tightly bound fermion pairs, whereas characteristic temperature of thermal pair decomposition grows monotonously
as a function of the coupling strength.

let us show how one can obtain a pseudogap phase starting from bcs hamiltonian. this was rst done in a
pioneering work by nozieres and schmitt-rink [6] and in formalism of functional integral by sa de melo, randeria
and engelbrecht [11]. in this subsection we simply reproduce part of the transparent article [11] and in the following

2

section we will show how qualitatively the same result can be obtained within nonlinear sigma model (3d xy-model)
approach proposed by the author [7]. in the following sections we discuss analogous nonlinear-sigma model approach
to the chiral gn and njl models.

the hamiltonian of the bcs model is:

h =x z ddx 

(x)(cid:18) 2

2m  (cid:19) (x) + gz ddx 

(x)

(x)(x)(x),

(1)

where (x) is the fermi eld operator,  =, denotes the spin components, m is the fermionic mass, and g < 0 the
strength of an attractive potential g(x  x).
the mean-eld equations for the gap parameter  and the chemical potential  can be obtained with a standard
variation procedure:

the -function potential produces divergence and requires regularization. a bcs superconductor possesses a natural
cuto supplied by the debye frequency d. for the crossover problem to be treated here this is no longer a useful
quantity, since in the strong-coupling limit all fermions participate in the interaction, not only those in a thin shell
of width d around the fermi surface. to be applicable in this regime, we renormalize the gap equation in three
dimensions with the help of the s-wave scattering length as, for which the low-energy limit of the two-body scattering
process gives an equally divergent expression [11]:

in which 1/kf as plays the role of a dimensionless coupling constant which monotonically increases from  to  as
the bare coupling constant g runs from small (bcs limit) to large values (bec limit). this equation is to be solved
simultaneously with (3). these mean-eld equations were rst analyzed in ref. [11].

(3) and (6) we have from (6) for the critical temperature in the bcs limit (  tc) t bcs

in the bcs limit, the chemical potential  does not dier much from the fermi energy f , whereas with increasing
interaction strength, the distribution function nk broadens and  decreases, and in the bec limit, on the other
hand we have tightly bound pairs and nondegenerate fermions with a large negative chemical potential ||  t .

case is  = f . in the strong coupling limit, from eqs . (3), (6) we obtain that in the bec limit  = eb/2, where
eb = 1/ma2
s is the binding energy of the bound pairs. in the bec limit, mean-eld eq. (3) gives that the gap sets in
at t   eb/2 log(eb/f )3/2. a simple chemical equilibrium estimate (b = 2f ) yields for the temperature of pair
dissociation: tdissoc  eb/ log(eb/f )3/2 which shows at strong couplings t  is indeed related to pair formation [11]
(which in the strong-coupling regime lies above the temperature of the onset of phase coherence [6,11]). obviously t 
is a monotonous function of coupling strength. if we take into the account gaussian uctuations we can see however
that in the strong coupling regime, temperature t , obtained with the above estimate is not related in any respect to
the critical temperature of the onset of phase coherence. expression for the thermodynamic potential with gaussian
corrections reads [6,11]:

where nk is fermi occupation and iql = it 2l. it is convenient following to [6] to rewrite  in terms of a phase shift
according to denition: (q,   i0) = |(q, )| exp(i(q, )). after inclusion of gaussian correction the number
equation n = / reads:

n = n0(, t ) +xq z

where n0 is density of free fermions dened in (3) and nb() = 1/(exp(/t )  1) is the bose function.
in
order to study behavior of tc one should solve a set of the number and gap equations. in the bcs limit tc is not
aected substantially by gaussian corrections and superconductive transition can be described by mean-eld theory
and correspondingly tc  t  1. in the opposite limit numerical solution [6,11] shows that the temperature of the
superconductive phase transition tends to a constant value that does not depend on the coupling strength and is equal
to the temperature of the condensation of the ideal bose gas of particles of mass 2m and density n/2, where m and
n are mass and density of electrons correspondingly:

tc =(cid:20)

n

2(3/2)(cid:21)2/3 

m

= 0.218f

(10)

where f was used simply as a dimensional constant, namely fermi energy of the gas of free fermions with density
n and mass m. obviously at very strong coupling strength, when all fermions are paired there is no fermi surface.

the system of the gap and number equations can be solved analytically in the strong-coupling limit. first as it
was pointed in [6,11] one can make the following approximation: to retain gaussian corrections only in the number
equation and solve it together with mean-eld gap equation. near tc in the strong -coupling regime one nds
that (tc) = eb/2, where eb is the energy required to break a pair. one can observe that in this limit (q, z)
has an isolated pole on the real axis for each q, representing a two-body bound state with momentum q. since
formally in this limit we can make energy required to break a pair arbitrarily large, this pole is widely separated
from the branch cut representing the continuum of two-particle excitations. the low energy physics at temperatures
much lower that temperature of thermal pair decomposition is governed by this pole and one can write (q, iqm) 
r(q)/[iqm  b(q) + 2], where b(q)  eb + |q|2/4m. the partition function then may be written in the following
form:

correspondingly the strong-coupling number equation reads:

xq,iql

z = z0z d d exp

n = n0 +xq

q(iql  b(q) + 2)q


nb[b(q)  2].

.

(11)

(12)

from which neglecting n0 follows result (10) [6,11] 2.

1as it was rst discussed in the sixties, even in the bcs superconductors there is a narrow region of precritical pairing
uctuations. this gives rise to so-called paraconductivity eect.
in particle physics, it was pointed on this phenomena by
hatsuda and kunihiro [10,3]
2the above estimate by [6,11] when we retained corrections only in the number equation renders correct limiting result (10)
however as it was observed by the authors of [6,11] in the intermediate coupling regime it gives an articial maximum in tc as
a function of coupling strength, this artifact is removed in higher approximations [12]

b. nonperturbative nonlinear sigma-model (nlsm) approach to the bcs-bec crossover in superconductors

the discussed above crossover in the bcs model was recently studied in details perturbatively in a variety of
approximations (see for example [12,13]). qualitatively, essential features of this crossover can be reproduced in
another simple model system - with the help of deriving of an eective non-linear sigma model (i.e. 3d xy-model)
[7]. moreover in the same framework of nonlinear sigma model one can study as well analogous crossover in 2d
superconductor [1618,7] that can not be addressed with discussed in the previous section perturbative method due
to absence of the long-range order in 2d. in two dimensions tc is identied with a temperature of the kosterltz-
thouless transition tkt in 2d xy-model. in the strong-coupling (or low carrier density) regime tkt lies essentially
lower than the temperature of the pair formation [1618,7].

as we have shown in [7], many essential features known from numerical study of strong-coupling and low carrier
density superconductors are reproduced with very good accuracy within nlsm approach.
in particular, nlsm
approach does not posses an articial maximum in tc in the regime of intermedium couplings that appears in the
approximation discussed in the previous section.

nlsm approach provides also a link between bcs-bec crossover in superconductors and analogous phenomenon

in the chiral gross-neveu model in 2 +  dimensions at zero temperature that is discussed in the next section.

1. xy-model approach to 3d superconductors

let us now reproduce results of previous subsection in the framework of nlsm approach proposed by the author

[7].

it is very transparent to study the properties of the bcs-bec to employ modulus-phase variables. following
to witten [15] we can write a partition function as a functional integral over modulus and phase of the hubbard-
stratonovich eld  exp(i):

z(, t ) =z dd exp [(t, (x), (x))].

(13)

assuming that phase uctuations do not aect local modulus of the complex hubbard -stratonovich eld we can write
thermodynamic potential as a sum of potential and kinetic (gradient) terms:

((x), (x))  grad(t, , (x)) + pot(t, ) =z d3x

j(t, )

2

()2 + pot(t, ).

(14)

obviously in the above expression eective potential pot(t, ) coincides with the ordinary mean-eld eective
potential. gradient term grad(t, , (x)) coincides with hamiltonian of 3d xy model with stiness j(, t ).

let us reproduce low-temperature expression for the phase stiness in strong-coupling regime from [7]:

j =

n
4m 

32m
162 t 3/2 exp"p2 + 2

t

# .

(15)

where n and m are density and mass of fermions. we can see that thermal corrections to the rst term in this regime
are exponentially suppressed and the r.h.s. tends in this limit quickly to

jbe =

n
4m

.

(16)

the form of this expression is not surprising - we see that at suciently strong coupling strength all fermions are
bound to pairs and stiness becomes equal of the phase stiness of the bose gas of density n/2 and mass 2m.
obviously all information about internal structure of composite bosons is evaporated from this expression in this
approximation since at low temperature in this regime there are no thermal pair decomposition eects. thus we see
that low-temperature expression for the stiness of the phase uctuations reaches a plateau value with increasing
coupling strength, whereas temperature of the thermal pair decomposition is a monotonously growing function of the
coupling strength.

in principle knowledge of lowest gradient term governing gaussian uctuations is not sucient for the study of the
position of the phase decoherence transition in a system with preformed pairs. in continuum, 3d xy model is a
free eld theory and there is no phase transition. phase transition of 3d xy model is studied in great details on a

5

lattice, so we can consider a lattice model of bcs-bec crossover and we can verify aposteriory to what extend lattice
model reproduces features of this crossover in continual model. many aspects of relation of 3d xy model to bose
condensation, in particular derivation of the gross-pitaevskii equation near tc can be found in [19].

so, let us consider theory (14) on a lattice with spacing a = 1/n1/3

pair where npair is concentration of cooper pairs.
this model describes condensation of hard-core bosons on the lattice and is a special case of bose-hubbard model 3.
critical temperature of the phase transition of 3d xy model can be obtained with a simple mean-eld estimate

[19] 4:

where a = n1/3
pair is the lattice spacing. in contrast to the ordinary 3dxy -model, in order to nd temperature of the
phase transition we should study a system of the equations (3), (6) , (15) and (17). system of these equations can be
solved however analytically in the strong coupling limit, the result is [7]:

with increasing coupling strength, this quickly tends from below to the value (compare with (10)):

tc =

(62)2/3 f  0.2f .

(18)

(19)

where dimensional constant f is fermi energy of free fermi gas of density n and mass m. we should observe that in
nonperturbative nlsm approach tc approaches plateau value (19), that depends only on mass 2m and density n/2
of composite bosons, from below. that is in agreement with numerical study in higher approximations [12], whereas
in the approach presented in previous subsection tc has an articial maximum at the intermediate coupling strength
thus approaching the limiting value from above. another circumstance that we discuss below is that nlsm approach
gives also qualitatively correct results in the opposite limit of weak-coupling strength [7]. in the weak-coupling limit
near tc, the stiness coecient may be derived with the help of gorkovs well-known method :

jbcs =

t 2 ,

(20)

this is precisely the coecient of the gradient term in the ginzburg-landau expansion. in the weak-coupling limit
the two temperatures of the onset of pairing correlations and the onset of phase coherence t  and tc merge according
to the formula [7]:

tc = t  

(22)2/3

2

t 5/2
3/2

 t ,

(21)

with it one can see [7] that in the weak-coupling limit, the temperature of the phase transition of the eective
xy-model tends from below to the characteristic temperature of the disappearance of the eective potential and
merges with it for innitesimally weak coupling strength. thus we arrive at some sort of aposteriori verication of
bcs behavior in this limit in the model of hard-core composite bosons on the lattice (i.e.
in this limit if nonzero
modulus of the complex gap function ei(x) appears at some temperature, at the same temperature phase coherence is
established and continuous symmetry is broken). in the weak and moderate coupling strength limits the disappearance
of superconductivity is a competition of two processes - pairbreaking which is thermal excitation of individual particles
and decoherence process which is thermal excitation of collective modes.

let us now summarize the results that follow from nlsm consideration. in this model in strong-coupling or low

carrier density regimes system possesses three phases:

3in ordinary attractive hubbard model considered in [6] critical temperature is a nonmonotonous function of the coupling
strength: tc decreases in the strong-coupling limit due to in that model composite bosons move via virtual ionization.
4 we should stress that estimation of critical temperature of the phase transition of the eective 3d xy model with mean-eld
methods has nothing to do with bcs mean eld approximation since derivation of the phase stiness coecient (15) required
studying the gaussian uctuations in the bcs model [7], and thus this may be regarded as the approximation of the same level
as considered in the previous section.

1. superconductive phase (t < t 3dxy

).

2. pseudogap phase (t 3dxy

< t < t ) - the phase where there exits local gap modulus  that signalizes existence
of the tightly bound (but noncondenced) fermion pairs but phase is random so average of the complex gap is zero
(< || exp(i) >= 0). so in this phase there is no superconductive gap and with it no symmetry breakdown.

c

3. normal phase (t > t ) the phase with thermally decomposed cooper pairs.

2. xy-model approach to 2d superconductors

in two dimension there is no proper long-range order and superconductive phase transition is associated with a
kosterlitz-thouless transition. in order to study this kt transition it is sucient to extract lowest gradient term
that determines temperature of the phase transition according to the formula [16], [17] [18], [7] 5:

tkt =


2

j(, tkt, (, tkt)).

(22)

this equation just like in the discussed above 3d case should be solved self-consistently with equations for the gap
modulus and chemical potential (3), (6). the result in the strong-coupling limit is [7]:

tkt 


8

n

m(cid:26)1 

1
8

exp(cid:20) 2

f  4(cid:21)(cid:27) .

(23)

thus for increasing coupling strength, the phase-decoherence temperature tkt tends very quickly towards a constant
value [1618,7] corresponding to kt transition in system of bosons with density n/2 and mass 2m (whereas charac-
teristic temperature of the thermal pair decomposition continues to grow monotonously with the growing coupling
strength):

tkt =


8

n
m

.

(24)

so, this phenomena in 2d is qualitatively similar to discussed above 3d case.

there is no superconductivity in the pseudogap phase however it exhibit reach exotic non-fermi-liquid behavior
due to local pairing correlations that makes it as interesting object of theoretical and experimental study as super-
conductive phase itself. in particular, along with specic heat, optical conductivity and tunneling experiments there
are following circumstances observed in the pseudogap phase: in experiments on ybco a signicant suppression of
in-plane conductivity ab() was observed at frequencies below 500 cm1 beginning at temperatures much above tc.
experiments on underdoped samples revealed deviations from the linear resistivity law. in particular ab( = 0; t )
increases slightly with decreasing t below a certain temperature. nmr and neutrons observations show that below
temperatures t  much higher than tc, spin susceptibility starts decreasing.

in conclusion, let us once more emphasis essential features of this phenomenon in superconductivity:

 away from a very special limit of innitesimally weak coupling strength and high carrier density, superconduc-
tors are characterized by two temperatures tc and t (>> tc). t  is characteristic temperature below which
pair correlations become important (or in the regime of strong interaction is characteristic temperature of the
formation of real bound pairs). tc corresponds to the onset of phase coherence in a system of preformed fermion
pairs. the region of non-fermi liquid behavior between tc and t  calls pseudogap phase, however term pseu-
dogap, originated in early experimental papers, may seem somewhat misleading since even though substantial
depletion of low-frequency spectral weight is observed in this region experimentally - there is no superconductive
gap in the spectrum.

5 in principle there is no kt phase transition in a charged system due to meissner eect, however coupling to electromagnetic
eld is always neglected in discussion of 2d superconductors, due to experimentally in-plane penetration length in high-tc
materials is much larger than coherence length.

7

 one should note that there is no proper phase transition at t , which is simply characteristic temperature
of thermal decomposition of certain fraction of noncondensed cooper pairs. even though the position of this
temperature may be reasonable estimated with mean-eld methods, second-order phase transition at t  is
certainly an artifact of the discussed above approximation. experiments on specic heat indicate however
certain features at this characteristic temperature.

in what follows we discuss possible implication of these results to qcd that may posses a phase analogous to
pseudogap phase in strong-coupling superconductors. the simplest model related to particle physics that displays
pseudogap behavior of dynamical origin is chiral gross-neveu model at low n that is discussed in the next section
in 2 +  dimensions.

iii. pseudogap phase in chiral gross-neveu model in 2 +  dimensions at low n

let us now discuss a phenomenon similar to pseudogap in a simple eld-theoretic model - chiral version of the

gross-neveu model [21], whose lagrange density is

l = ai / a +

g0

2n h(cid:0) aa(cid:1)2

+(cid:0) ai5a(cid:1)2i .

(25)

where index a runs from 1 to n . appearance of the pseudogap phase in this model has quite similar roots with the
discussed above phenomenon in strong-coupling superconductors. in superconductors we observed appearance of the
pseudogap phase in the regime away from innitesimally weak coupling strength or extremely high carrier density -
i.e. in the regime when bcs mean-eld treatment is no longer valid. chiral gross-neveu model can be treated in the
limit of innite number of eld components n in a framework of mean-eld approach quite similar to bcs theory.
transparently in the mean-eld approximation one can nd only one phase transition at certain value of the coupling
strength, similar to bcs phase transition. however, at low n , system start to perform dynamic chiral uctuations
which as we have shown in [4] give rise to a second, phase disorder, transition. so at low n the model possesses two
phase transitions at two characteristic values of renormalized coupling constant and one can drive a straightforward
analogy to two characteristic temperatures tkt and t  in the case of a superconductor in 2+1 dimension. let us
reproduce this result.

one can write the collective eld action for this model as:

acoll[] = n(cid:26)

1
2g0

(2 + 2)  itr log [i /  (x)  i5](cid:27) .

(26)

this expression is invariant under the continuous set of chiral o(2) transformations which rotate  and  elds into
each other. this model is equivalent to another one:

here c is the matrix of charge conjugation which is dened by

l = ai / a +

(28)

in two dimensions, we choose the -matrices as 0 = 1, 1 = i2, and c = 1. the second model goes over

in the limit n   this result is exact. on the other hand in the opposite limit of low n system starts to
perform uctuations around saddle-point solution and in order to describe this system properly one should go beyond
mean-eld approximation and study propagator of the -eld - where  is the phase of the order parameter.

let us consider rst the case  = 0 where the collective eld theory consists of complex eld  with o(2)-symmetry
 = ||ei. such a system possesses macroscopic excitations of the form of vortices and antivortices that attract each
other by a logarithmic coulomb potential. it is known [22] that in a such eld theory involving a pure phase eld
(x), with a lagrange density

l =

[(x)]2,

(36)

where  is the stiness of the -uctuations, there is a kostrelitz-thouless transition when the stiness falls below
kt = 2/ [22].

let us return to gross-neveu model. performing an expansion around saddle point solution one can nd propagator

of the -eld when  = 0 [4]:

we identify the stiness  = n/4.

the pair version of the chiral gross-neveu model has therefore a vortex-antivortex pair breaking transition if n

falls below the critical value nc = 8.

consider now the model in 2 +  dimensions where pairs form when renormalized coupling constant becomes larger

than the critical value g = g  . in this case the expression for the stiness of phase uctuations reads [4]

as n is lowered below this critical value, the phase uctuations of the pair eld  become incoherent and the pair

fig. 2. the two transition lines in the n  g-plane of the chiral gross-neveu model in 2 +  dimensions. in order to stress
dierence between local gap (i.e. pseudogap) and superconductive (i.e. average) gap we denote by m modulus of the order
parameter (m = |0|). in this model m plays the role of the quark mass. for  = 0, the vertical transition line coincides
with the n -axis, and the solid hyperbola degenerates into a horizontal line at nc = 8. in the limit n   generation of the
quark mass happens simultaneously with phase ordering transition.

in the chiral formulation of the same model in 2 + dimensions, the pseudogap phase has chiral symmetry in spite
of a nonzero spontaneously generated quark mass m = |0| 6= 0. this phase is directly related to the pseudogap
phase of a strong-coupling superconductor - where there are cooper pairs but there is no symmetry breakdown due
to violent phase uctuations. the reason why this is possible is that the quark mass depends only on |0|, thus
allowing for arbitrary phase uctuations preserving chiral symmetry. it is very easy to see that the solid hyperbola
in fig. 2 is not simply the proper (albeit approximate) continuation of the vertical line for smaller n . there are
two simple counterarguments. one is formal: for innitesimal  the rst transition lies precisely at g = g =  for
all n , so that the horizontal transition line is clearly distinguished from it (stiness of the phase uctuation in the
regime g/g  0 just like in the case of superconductor reaches plateau value that does not depend on the coupling
strength and ). the other argument is physical and also has a clear analogy in the corresponding phenomena in
superconductivity. if n is lowered at some very large g, the binding energy of the pairs increases with 1/n {in two
dimensions, the binding energy is 4m sin2[/2(n  1)]}. it is then impossible that the phase uctuations on the
horizontal branch of the transition line, which are low-energy excitations, unbind the strongly bound pairs. accuracy
of the bcs scenario in the limit n   is clearly seen from the form of phase stiness that has a factor n that
freezes phase in this limit and thus basically all the physics in governed by the size of the gap modulus.

iv. chiral fluctuations in the njl model

as it was mentioned above, recently there was made an attempt [8] of generalization to njl model a nonlinear-
sigma model approach proposed by the author for bcs-bec crossover in 3d superconductors. the authors [8] claimed
that according to their estimates njl model does not display spontaneous breakdown of the chiral symmetry. we
show below that even though nonlinear sigma model approach works in the discuss above 2 +  -dimension case, this

6there is a misleading statement about 3d case in [4]

10

approach can not be generalized to njl model and thus it can not be used to judge if chiral symmetry is restored by
the chiral uctuations at low nc.

the lagrangian of the njl model reads [1]:

l = i/ +

g0

2nc h(cid:0) (cid:1)2

+(cid:0) ai5(cid:1)2i .

the three 2 2-dimensional matrices a/2, generate the fundamental representation of avor su (2), and are normal-
ized by tr(ab) = 2ab.

(41)

(42)

(43)

one can introduce hubbard - stratonovich elds  and a:

l =  (i/    i5aa)  

nc

2g0 (cid:0)2 + 2
a(cid:1) .

after integrating out quark elds, standard mean-eld variation procedure gives the gap equation:

trtrf(cid:20)g(x, x)(cid:18) 1

ia5(cid:19)(cid:21) =

1

g0(cid:18) (x)
a(x)(cid:19).

one can choose pseudoscalar solution ato be vanishing and scalar solution   m given by a gap equation:

p2  m 2

the momentum integral is regularized by means of a cuto . the constituent quark mass m in the limit nc  
is analogous to superconductive gap in the bcs limit of the theory of superconductivity.
just like in the discussed above gn model, at nite nc one can study uctuations around the saddle point solution:

the quadratic terms of expansion around saddle point are:

where (,

in the above expression one should introduce a momentum cuto 2. for small momenta inverse propagators can be
written as

(47)

in analogy to 3d xy-model approach to strong-coupling superconductivity the authors of [8] introduced a unit vector
eld ni  (n0, na)  (, a)/ and set up an eective nonlinear sigma-model

a0[ni] =



2 z d4x[ni(x)]2.

the prefactor  is playing role of the stiness of the unit eld uctuations:

 = m 2z(m, 2).

(48)

(49)

let us recall now a standard procedure of the estimation of the critical stiness of the o(4)-nonlinear sigma model:
one can relax constrain n2

i = 1 and introduce an extra integration over the lagrange multiplier  rewriting (48) as:

11

integrating out the ni(x)-elds, one can nd



2 z d4x(cid:8)[ni(x)]2 + (cid:2)n2

(50)

(51)

where nn is the number of components of ni(x), and tr denotes the functional trace. this yields a gap equation:

(52)

(53)

now let us observe that from the arguments given in [8] it does not follow that njl model does not display spontaneous
symmetry breakdown at nc = 3. at rst, in contrast to described above 2 + -dimensional case one, unfortunaltely,
can not made any similar calculations in the closed form in 3 + 1-dimensions due to this theory is not renormalizable
and one can not assume cuto of meson loops to be set equal to cuto for quark loops [23]. so stiness coecient
should depend on two parameters 1 and 2. however the nonlinear sigma model approach for precritical uctuations
in njl model is unfortunately plagued by a more fatal defect: in principle critical stiness of the nonlinear sigma
model is not an universal quantity and is expressed via an additional cuto 3 in the gap equation (53). so in
principle knowledge of the stiness of njl model is not sucient for nding the position of the phase transition in
the eective nonlinear sigma model. the situation is just like in a heisenberg magnet where critical temperature
depends on the stiness along with lattice spacing and lattice structure, and if one is given only a stiness coecient
one can not determine temperature of the phase transition. the situation is in contrast to 2d case when position of
the kt-transition can be deduced from the stiness coecient. it can be seen very transparently in the case of 3d
superconductor: there, in continual case, characteristic 3d xy-model is a free eld theory and has no phase transition
at all. the phase transition appears only in the lattice theory and of course its temperature depends on the lattice
spacing. however choosing lattice spacing to be equal to 1/n1/3
bosons (this amounts to mapping a system of cooper pairs
to the system of hardcore composite bosons on the lattice, see previous sections) the result surprisingly reproduce
extremely accurate a phase diagram of the continual theory. in the case of njl model there are however no length
scales that can be used to estimate position of the phase transition of the eective nonlinear sigma model. there
was made an attempt of nding such a scale in the paper [8], namely it was suggested that since the pion elds are
composite, they are not dened over length scales much shorter than the inverse binding energy of the pair wave
function which is equal to 2m . following to this assumption the authors of [8] performed the integral in eq. (53)
up to the cuto 2m proposing it as an estimate for the critical stiness of the eective sigma model. however,
unfortunately, there is no reason to use this scale for such estimate. in fact even if to consider following to [8] that
pion elds are not dened over the scales shorter than that it would be an estimate for upper boundary of the value
of the critical stiness and thus one could not nd from it if the directional uctuations in njl can restore chiral
symmetry at low nc. moreover if do not take it into the account and proceed exactly along the same lines as in [8] this
construction would lead to incorrect result of absence of superconductivity in a strong-coupling superconductor too:
there, in the strong-coupling limit, low-temperature phase stiness of the eective 3d xy model tends to a plateau
value j = n/4m, where n and m are density and mass of fermions. temperature of the phase transition of the 3d
a, where a is the lattice spacing. in the strong coupling limit size of the cooper pair tends to
xy-model is tc 
zero and thus following to the above arguments we would come to a conclusion of absence of the superconductivity
in strong-coupling superconductors too. one should also observe that in the strong-coupling (or low-carrier density)
superconductors there are two distinct characteristic length scales: cooper pair size and coherence length [20], this
is not surprising since in a bose gas coherence length has nothing to do with a size of the bosons, even though in
bcs superconductors these two length scales coincide. accurate treatment [20] shows that whereas in this limit in
continual theory, cooper pairs size tends to zero , the coherence length tends to innity, however using this second
length scale for the above estimate also would lead us to a qualitatively wrong result. so, unfortunately nonlinear
sigma model arguments can not lead in principle to the conclusion of the absence of the chiral symmetry breakdown
in njl model. moreover exact results of formation of a pseudogap phase in the chiral gn model in 2 +  -dimensions
at low n [4] can not be generalized in principle to njl model in a straightforward manner.

v. conclusion

in this paper we discussed possibility of formation of a phase analogous to pseudogap phase of strong-coupling
superconductors in relativistic four-fermion theories related to qcd. the motivation for such study is the close
relation between nambujona-lasinio and gross-neveu models and the bcs theory of superconductivity. weak
coupling and high carrier density superconductors can be described well by a mean-eld theory. in the framework
of this theory onset of superconductivity can be viewed as a pair formation transition: i.e. when pairs are formed
at certain temperature they are condensed and continuous symmetry is broken. however now it is a well-known fact
that in strong-coupling and low carrier density superconductors the temperatures of the onset of pairing correlation
and pair condensation do not coincide and moreover theoretically can be arbitrarily separated. n   treatment
of njl and chiral gn models is analogous to bcs mean-eld theory of superconductors, whereas at low n , in the
case of chiral gn model, it was proven that low-n limit gives rise to a phase analogous to pseudogap phase of
superconductors. however as we have shown above, the approach developed by us in [7,4] can not be generalized
in principle to njl model in 3 + 1-dimensions. this resolves also numerous controversial discussions initiated by a
recent attempt of such a generalization in [8] that lead the authors of [8] to a conclusion that there is no spontaneous
breakdown of chiral symmetry in njl model.

however, since the precritical pairing uctuations and pseudogap phase should be a general feature of any fermi
system with attraction and moreover it is a dominating region on a phase diagram of strong-coupling and low carrier
density superconductors, the interesting question is to what extend analogous phase may be developed in qcd and
color superconductors. indication of possible importance of the pseudogap concept in particle physics is the mentioned
above existence of this phenomenon in the chiral gross-neveu model at low n . even though these results can not be
directly generalized to njl model, one can guess that in analogy to 3d xy-model approach to strong-coupling and
low carrier density superconductivity, one can set up a nonlinear 3d o(4)-sigma model with temperature depended
stiness coecient as a toy model for qcd at nite temperatures that would possess two characteristic temperatures
corresponding to discussed in this paper tc and t .

speaking about the bcs-bec crossover, precritical uctuations and the pseudogap phase, it should be noted as
well that in some sense similar phenomena are known in a large variety of condensed matter systems, in particular,
except for superconductors we can mention itinerant and local-momentum theories of magnetism, exitionic condensate
in semiconductors, ferroelectrics and josephson junction arrays.
