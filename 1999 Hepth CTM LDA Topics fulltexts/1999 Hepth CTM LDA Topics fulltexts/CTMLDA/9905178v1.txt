if the vacuum is passive for uniformly accelerated observers
in antide sitter spacetime (i.e. cannot be used by them to
operate a perpetuum mobile), they will (a) register a unique
value of the hawkingunruh temperature and (b) nd that
products of observables which are localized in complementary
wedgeshaped regions necessarily commute with each other in
the vacuum state. thus the stability properties of the vacuum
induce a geodesic causal structure on this spacetime which
seems incompatible with true interaction.

quantum eld theory in antide sitter spacetime (ads)
has recently received considerable attention [1]. it seems
therefore worthwhile to clarify in a model independent
setting the universal properties of such theories which
are implied by generally accepted and physically mean-
ingful constraints. we report here on the results of an
investigation of this question [2] which brought to light
an intimate relation between stability properties of the
vacuum, the value of the hawkingunruh temperature
registered by uniformly accelerated observers, and local-
ity properties of their respective observables. as will be
explained, these results hold in any theory which allows
one to specify the spacetime localization properties of ob-
servables, and they suggest that quantum eld theories
in ads cannot describe true interaction.

we consider here ads of any dimension n  3. it can
conveniently be described in terms of cartesian coordi-
nates in the ambient space rn+1 as the quadric

adsn = {x  rn+1 : x2  x2

n1+x2

n = r2}

with metric g = diag(1, 1, . . . , 1, 1) in diagonal form.
its isometry group is o(2, n  1) whose identity compo-
nent will be denoted by so0(2, n  1).

any quantum eld theory in ads has to determine the
following structure, which is indispensible for its physical
interpretation:
(i) a hilbert space h, describing the physical states, and
a continuous unitary representation u of the symmetry
group so0(2, n  1), acting on h [3].
(ii) a set of operators which describe the observables of
the theory. since these operators can be added and mul-
tiplied, they generate an algebra a which will be called
the algebra of observables [4].

it is a fundamental feature of quantum eld theory
and its modern ramications that the spacetime local-
ization properties of observables enter into the formalism
in an essential way. one can tell whether an observable
is localized about a spacetime point, a string, loop, disk
etc. thus, given any region o  adsn , one can identify
those observables which are localized within that region
and dene a corresponding subalgebra a(o)  a which
is generated by them. since there exist no fewer observ-
ables if the region becomes larger, one obviously has

a(o1)  a(o2)

if o1  o2.

the localization of observables has to be compatible
with the action of the spacetime symmetry group. if an
observable a is localized in the region o, say, its im-
age u ()au ()1 under the action of   so0(2, n  1)
should be localized in the transformed region o. the
transformation properties of the observables under the
action of the unitaries u () may be quite complicated,
but fortunately this detailed information is not needed
here. all that matters are the geometrical aspects of the
transformations, which can be summarized as follows.
(iii) for each region o  adsn and   so0(2, n  1)
one has the equality (in the settheoretic sense)

u ()a(o)u ()1 = a(o).

we emphasize that we do not postulate here from the
outset local commutation relations of the observables.
for, in contrast to the case of globally hyperbolic space
times, the principle of einstein causality does not provide
any clues as to which observables in ads should com-
mute. instead, we will derive such commutation relations
from stability properties of the vacuum. since this sta-
bility aspect sheds also new light on the phenomenon of
the hawkingunruh temperature, we explain this point
in somewhat more detail.

we begin by describing the observers in ads which
are of interest here. let xo  adsn be any point
and let (t), t  r, be any oneparameter subgroup of
so0(2, n  1) such that t  (t)xo is an orthochronous
curve [5]. we interpret this curve as the worldline of
some observer (assumed to be male for concreteness).
depending on the initial data chosen, this observer will
be geodesic or experience some constant acceleration.
points in the neighborhood of xo will in general also

give rise to orthochronous curves under the action of the
chosen subgroup of so0(2, n  1), and we denote by w
the connected neighborhood of xo in adsn consisting of
all such curves. the region w, which can be all of ads
or a subset of it, is that part of the spacetime where
the observer can perform measurements. his observables
are described by the selfadjoint elements of a(w) and
his dynamics is given by e itm  u ((t)) with generator
(hamiltonian) m [6].

let us discuss next what this observer can say about
the properties of the vacuum, described by the unit vec-
tor |0i  h. first, he should nd that the vacuum is in
a stationary state with respect to his dynamics, i.e.

a priori unknown   0, the kubomartinschwinger
(kms) condition, which can be presented in the form [8]

h0|be m a|0i = h0|ab|0i,

for all a, b  a(w).
in the latter case the respective
observer would interpret the vacuum as a thermal equi-
librium state at temperature 1.

it is convenient here to proceed to another formula-
tion of the above result. making use of the fact that
h0|ab|0i = h0|b a|0i and that the set of vectors
a(w) |0i is dense in h [2], the above relation allows one
to dene an antiunitary operator j on h by setting [9]

m |0i = 0.

ja|0i  e (/2)m a|0i for a  a(w).

second, he can check whether the vacuum is suitable to
operate a perpetuum mobile of the second kind. to this
end he would perform all kinds of operations in w which
can be described by perturbations of the generator m in
that region. timedependent perturbation theory then
tells us that the state of the vacuum changes under the
inuence of such perturbations and is described by a vec-
tor v |0i for some unitary operator v  a(w) after the
perturbation has been turned o. since this challenge
of the second law ought to fail, the observer should nd
that, no matter what he does, the energy of the nal state
is no less than that of the initial vacuum, i.e. he cannot
extract energy from the vacuum. in formula form,

h0| v m v |0i  h0| m |0i = 0

for all unitary operators v  a(w). this property of
a state  not being able to perform work in a cyclic
process  is called passivity [7].

finally, the observer can test with the help of time
averages of his observables (yielding order parameters)
whether the vacuum is a mixture of dierent phases.
since the vacuum is the most elementary system, the an-
swer should be negative, i.e. all order parameters should
have sharp values. this is the content of the relation
(mixing property)

for a, b  a(w), where a(t)  e itm ae itm . these ba-
sic features of the vacuum can be summarized as follows.
(iv) the vacuum |0i is, for all geodesic and all uniformly
accelerated observers, a stationary, passive and mixing
state.

let us now turn to the analysis of the implications of
these assumptions. here we prot from a deep result of
pusz and woronowicz for arbitrary quantum dynamical
systems [7]. in the present context this result says that
the vacuum vector |0i is, as a consequence of its passivity
and mixing properties, either a ground state for the dy-
namics m of the above observer, or it satises, for some

2

our main task will be to determine the specic prop-
erties of this operator. in order to simplify the necessary
computations, we consider the particular choice of region

w = {x  adsn : x1 > |x0| , xn > 0}

on which the oneparameter subgroup of boosts 01(t),
t  r, in the 01plane acts in an orthochronous manner.
for any xo  w, the curve t  01(t)xo is the worldline
of some observer, as described above.

we shall determine the temperature felt by this ob-
server. since the generator m01 of his dynamics is trans-
fomed into m01 by the adjoint action of the rotation
e im12 in the 12plane, it cannot be a positive operator.
hence |0i is not a ground state for this observer; it must
therefore satisfy the kmscondition for some   0. so
what is the value of  ?

to answer this question, we apply the methods in [11].
we pick a region o such that 02(s) o  w for the boosts
02(s) in the 02plane with suciently small parameter
s. by the group law in so0(2, n  1) we have

e itm01 e ism02 = e is(cosh(t)m02+sinh(t)m12)e itm01 .

taking into account that the boost e ism02 is the dynam-
ics of some other observer, we infer from (iv) that |0i is
invariant under its action. thus we get for any vector
| i  h and operator a  a(o)

h| e itm01 e ism02 ae ism02 |0i
= h| e is(cosh(t)m02+sinh(t)m12) e itm01 a|0i.

at this point we are in the position to combine the
kmscondition with a basic result in the representation
theory of lie groups, due to nelson [10]. in the present
situation this result can be stated as follows: there exists
a dense set of vectors | i  h such that the correspond-
ing vector functions

u, v  e i(um02+vm12) | i

are analytic in a xed neighborhood of the origin of c.

returning to the analysis of the above equality, we
note that according to condition (iii) the operator
e ism02 ae ism02 appearing in the matrix element on the
left hand side is an element of a(02(s)o)  a(w). so,
in view of the kmscondition, we can continue this term
analytically in t to i/2. in the expression on the right
hand side there appears a product of two unitary op-
erators which both depend on t.
if we choose for | i
a nelson vector, as described above, the rst operator,
standing next to h|, can be analytically continued in t
to i/2, provided s is suciently small. the second op-
erator, standing next to a|0i, can likewise be continued
to i/2 by the kmscondition. so we arrive at

h| e (/2)m01 e ism02 ae ism02 |0i
= h| e is(cos(/2)m01+i sin(/2)m12)e (/2)m01a|0i.

bearing in mind the denition of j and the invariance of
the vacuum under the boosts e ism02 , we can bring this
relation into the more transparent form

h| je ism02 a|0i = h| e is(cos(/2)m02+i sin(/2)m12)ja|0i.

as this holds for the dense sets of vectors | i and a|0i,
respectively, we conclude that

je ism02 = e is(cos(/2)m02+i sin(/2)m12)j.

the operator on the left hand side is antiunitary, so the
same must be true for the operator on the right hand
side. this is only possible if  is an integer multiple
of 2, for otherwise the operator appearing in the expo-
nential function is not skew-adjoint. by a more rened
functional analytic argument one can restrict  even fur-
ther and show that its only possible value is  = 2 [2].
proceeding to the proper time scale of the observer
[6], we conclude that he is exposed to the hawking
unruh temperature (1/2)(( 01(0) xo)2)1/2, in accor-
dance with the value found in model computations [12].
by similar arguments one can compute the temperature
felt by other observers, such as geodesic ones, for whom
it is zero [2]. thus we have established the following
general fact:

each geodesic or uniformly accelerated observer testing
the vacuum state in ads nds a universal value of the
hawkingunruh temperature which depends only on his
particular orbit.

this result is entirely a consequence of the passivity
of the vacuum. hence this state is the only one which is
passive for all observers.

having computed the value of , let us return now
to the analysis of j. plugging  = 2 into the above
equality for j, we see that for small s

je ism02 = e ism02 j.

in a similar manner one can determine the intertwining
properties of j with other oneparameter subgroups of
so0(2, n  1), and thereby with all unitaries u (). we
skip these computations and only state the result [2]:

ju () = u ()j,

where  is the reection which changes the sign of the
01coordinates of the points in adsn . this result also
allows us to show explicitly that j 2 = 1 [9]: for the
intertwining relation and the antiunitarity of j imply

je (/2)m01 = e (/2)m01 j,

hence we have, in view of the dening equation for j,

j 2a = je (/2)m01a = e (/2)m01 ja

= e (/2)m01e (/2)m01 a = a,

for all a  a(w). summing up, we have established the
following analogue of the tcptheorem:

the unitary representation u of so0(2, n  1) extends
to a representation of so(2, n  1), in which the reec-
tion  is implemented by the antiunitary operator j .

this result is a purely grouptheoretic statement which
does not say anything about the adjoint action of j on
the observables. in order to gain insight into the nature
of this latter action, we consider the observables which
are localized in the region

w   {x  adsn : x1 > |x0|, xn > 0}.

since the regions w and w  are obtained by intersecting
opposite wedgeshaped regions in the ambient space with
adsn , we call them opposite wedges.

by a rotation in the 12plane about the angle , the
region w is transformed into w , and vice versa. thus,
if a  a(w) one has a  e im12 ae im12  a(w ),
cf. (iii). by the intertwining relation for j, we have
je im12 = e im12 j = e im12 j, where we used the fact
that e i2m12 = 1 [3]. finally, the group structure im-
plies that e im12 e (/2)m01 = e (/2)m01e im12 . comb-
ing these facts, we can compute

ja = je im12 a = e im12 ja

= e im12 e (/2)m01a = e (/2)m01 e im12 a
= e (/2)m01 a.

picking any a  a(w ), b  a(w), we obtain with the
help of this result

h0|ab|0i = h0|b a|0i = h0|b j ja|0i
= h0|b e (/2)m01e (/2)m01 a|0i = h0|ba|0i.

this relation can be extended to arbitrary s by itera-
tion, if one decomposes e ism02 into an mfold product
(e i(s/m)m02 )m for suciently large m.

thus we nd that the elements of a(w) and a(w ) com-
mute in the vacuum state. it is apparent that the same
statement holds also for the algebras corresponding to all

3

transformed opposite wedges w and w . this com-
mutativity, in the vacuum state, of observables which are
localized in certain complementary regions is sometimes
called weak locality. so we can state:

observables which are localized in opposite wedges of

ads are weakly local with respect to each other.

this establishes the asserted general relation between
passivity properties of the vacuum and commensurabil-
ity properties of observables. in theories where the basic
elds satisfy cnumber commutation relations, it follows
from this result that observables localized in opposite
wedges commute also in the usual (operator) sense, in
accord with the structure found in concrete models [13].
before we turn to the discussion of our results, let us
mention another property of j which holds in all theories
complying with the following stronger locality condition:
(v) observables which are localized in opposite wedges
of ads commute with each other.

this situation prevails in the models of current interest
[15]. it implies that the operator j implements the geo-
metric action of the reection  also on the observables,

ja(w)j  = a(w).

as a matter of fact, the validity of this relation is equiv-
alent to the strong locality condition. the proof of this
result relies on methods of tomitatakesaki theory and
will be given elsewhere [2]. there it will also be shown
that mild constraints on the mulitplicities of the eigenval-
ues 2n0 of the generator m0n (existence of the partition
function tr e m0n) imply that observables in opposite
wedges are statistically (causally) independent [14].

we have established in this letter a tight relation be-
tween stability properties of the vacuum and commensu-
rabilty properties of observables on ads. such relations
exist also in other spacetimes, but they are of particular
interest in the case of ads. for they reveal that observ-
ables in opposite wedges w and w  necessarily commute
with each other, either weakly or strongly.

this result appears to be very strange at rst sight,
since any point in w can be connected with any other
point in w  by some timelike curve. hence measurements
at these points should aect each other and not be com-
mensurable (let alone be statistically independent).

after a moments reection, however, one sees that the
regions w and w , although causally connected in the
usual sense, cannot be connected by timelike geodesics.
so the following picture emerges, which explains the un-
expected commensurability properties of the observables:
the perturbations which are produced by observers in
the region w move, after having left the region, along
geodesics and therefore do not reach w .
in noninter-
acting theories this picture is reasonable, and free eld
models show that it is also consistent. but it seems to
be in conict with the patterns of interaction processes.
imagine an experimenter who produces unstable par-
ticles in the region w. by preparing carefully the initial

momenta of the particles, he can determine to some ex-
tent the spacetime point on their respective orbits where
they will decay. as the decay products no longer move
along the original geodesics, some can reach the region
w  and perturb measurements there. but also the quan-
tum eects of measurements would produce these unsta-
ble particles with a certain probability. it seems therefore
impossible that all observables in w and w  are commen-
surable in this case. so the inevitable geodesic causal
commutation relations of observables in ads seem to ex-
clude true interaction. the only way out of this clash
between geometry and interaction seems to be to pro-
ceed from ads to its covering space.

[3] it is sucient here to consider the subspace of bosonic
states, so we do not need to proceed to the covering group
of the spacetime symmetry group.

without dwelling on this point any further. for more in-
formation on the mathematical background, cf.

[5] it is meaningless to talk about past and future in ads,
but one can still assign a time direction to causal curves.
[6] we choose a xed parametrization of the pertinent sub-
groups of so0(2, n  1). the proper time of the observer
is obtained by rescaling t with (( (0) xo)2)1/2.
