(2)) single time, e.g. = 0, already contains information time dependence: first, eigenvalues polyakov line time-independent, since time evolution given (x, t) = u +(x, t) (x, 0) u(x, t) , (107) 23 u(x, t) su(2) parallel transporter (x, 0) (x, t) along straight line. relation implies monopoles static. second, temporal boundary conditions u given terms (x, 0), u(x, 0) = 1 , u(x, ) = (x, 0) , (108) chosen temporal extension space-time . boundary conditions u, course, restrict possible time dependence . turns restriction determines instanton number. before, charts s3 (or stereographic projection) chosen monopole spatial innity, (x, 0) (x) 6= 1 |x| .
