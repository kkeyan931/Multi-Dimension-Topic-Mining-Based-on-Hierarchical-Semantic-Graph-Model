abstract

we study the heat kernel for an operator of laplace type with a -
function potential concentrated on a closed surface. we derive the general
form of the small t asymptotics and calculate explicitly several rst heat
kernel coecients.

1 introduction

singular potentials are a frequently used idealization of physical situations allow-
ing for an easier (and, sometimes, explicit) solution while keeping the essential
features of the problem. the best studied cases of singular potentials are the
delta function potentials concentrated at isolated points, which describe contact
interactions of particles (for a review, see [1]). rigorous analysis of such potentials
was initiated by the paper by berezin and faddeev [2] and has developed later in
a mature mathematical discipline [1]. other cases of singular potentials include
also cosmic strings and other topological defects [3] and problems related to the
black hole entropy [4]. we like also to mention a recent work on the boundary
discontinuities [5].

with respect to the casimir eect, a delta function shaped potential provides
the simplest generalization of the conductor boundary conditions towards inclu-
sion of more realistic properties of the walls like partial transparency. for a scalar
and a spinor eld with plane boundaries this problem has been investigated in
[6], for moving partly transmitting mirrors in [7]. an interesting approach us-
ing semihard and weak boundaries is developed in [8].
in all those cases it
is crucial to know the ultra violet divergences in order to nd out the structure
of necessary counterterms. this is equivalent to the investigation of the corre-
sponding heat kernel asymptotics. as it is known [9], this is an expansion with
respect to integer powers of the proper time parameter t (see below) for laplace
type operators on closed manifolds and to half integer powers, i.e., to powers of
t, on manifolds with boundaries and dirichlet or robin boundary conditions.
for more complicated pseudo dierential operators powers of ln t may appear.

the present paper is devoted to singularities which are located on closed hy-
persurfaces of dimension m 1 where m is dimension of the underlying manifold.
apart from the quantum mechanical problem of a particle in the space with
semitransparent boundaries (for a recent calculation of the vacuum energy for
such system see e.g. [10]) possible physical application also include fermions on a
background of a magnetic tube [11] and photons interacting with dielectric bodies
[12, 13]. in all these cases the dynamics is described by a second order dier-
ential operator of laplace type supplemented by certain matching conditions on
a surface. our primary interest is in the heat kernel asymptotics. they govern
the short time asymptotics of quantum mechanical propagators, the ultra violet
divergences and the large mass expansion in quantum eld theory.

the heat kernel coecients for singular potentials cannot be obtained in gen-
eral as limiting cases of smooth congurations. this is clear already from the
fact that the heat kernel expansion for a smooth potential contains powers of the
potential taken at the same point. such expressions become ill-dened in the
delta-function limit. in our previous paper [13] we have observed a surprising
property that sometimes the ultra violet behavior of a system with -function
potential is less singular than that of corresponding smooth system.

let us proceed with basic denitions. let m be a smooth riemannian man-
ifold of dimension m. let  be a smooth closed submanifold of co-dimension 1.
let v be a vector bundle over m. let e and v be endomorphisms of v and v|
respectively. in more physical notations, e and v are matrix valued functions
bearing spin and internal indices. in the present paper we study the heat kernel
expansion for the operator

d = (2 + e(x) + v (x)) = d0  v (x) .

(1)

let dx and dy be the riemannian volume elements on m and . we normalize
the function  in such a way that for any smooth function f

zm

f (x)dx = z

f (y)dy .

we adopt the following short hand notations for the integrals

zm

dx f (x) = {f}[m] ,

z

dy f (y) = {f}[] .

(2)

(3)

we can choose the coordinates in such a way that in the vicinity of  the

metric has the form

gijdxidxj = (dxm)2 + gabdxadxb .

(4)

the second fundamental form of  is lab = 1
2 mgab. we suppose that xm = 0 on
. our notations are the same as in ref.[14]. rijkl are the components of the

2

riemann curvature tensor. with our sign conventions, r1212 is negative on the
standard sphere in euclidean space. the ricci tensor  and the scalar curvature
 are given by

ij := rikkj

 = ii = rikki.

(5)

let 2 := ijij and r2 := rijklrijkl be the norm of the ricci and full curva-
ture tensors. let ij be the endomorphism valued components of the curvature
of the connection on v. in physical language, ij is the eld strength for the
yang-mills and spin-connections. let ; denote multiple covariant dierentiation
with respect to the levi-civita connection of m and let : denote multiple tan-
gential covariant dierentiation on the boundary with respect to the levi-civita
connection of ; the dierence between these two is measured by the second
fundamental form. for example, f;jj = f;mm + f;aa = f;mm + f:aa  laaf;m.
a mathematically rigorous way to dene the spectral problem for the operator
d is to replace it by the spectral problem for d0 for x 6  supplemented by the
conditions on  (see e.g. [1])

(0) = (+0)
m(0)  m(+0) = v (0)

with the short hand notation (0) = limxm0 (x).

the heat kernel k(x, y; t) is a solution of the heat equation

with the initial condition

(t + d0)k(x, y; t) = 0

k(x, y; 0) = (x, y) ,

(6)
(7)

(8)

(9)

which satises the matching conditions on  following from (6) and (7).

we are interested in the integrated heat kernel

k(f, d; t) = {f (x)k(x, x; t)}[m] = tr(f exp(td)) .

(10)

on manifolds with boundary with local boundary conditions there is an asymp-
totic expansion as t  +0

k(f, d; t) = xn=0

an(f, d)t(nm)/2 ,

(11)

where the coecients an(f, d) are volume and surface integrals of local invariants.
the existence of the asymptotic expansion (11) is usually considered as granted.
there are however important exceptions (besides genuine pseudo dierential
operators, the square root of laplacian for instance), such as the boundary value
problem for spectral boundary conditions and -function potentials with point-
like support on manifolds with dimension m  2. in such cases ln t terms can
appear in the asymptotic expansion [15, 16, 17]. to the best of our knowledge,

3

the existence of the expansion (11) for the problem considered here has never
been stated before.

this paper is organized as follows. in the next section we derive an integral
equation for the heat kernel and show validity of the asymptotic expansion (11).
in section 3 we calculate the heat kernel asymptotics for the particular case when
 is a sphere in rm. in section 5 we derive explicit expressions for the heat kernel
coecients an(f, d), n  5 for the most general form of the operator d. to this
end we use the particular case calculations of section 4 and functorial properties
of the heat kernel.

2 general structure of the heat kernel

to study the general structure of the heat kernel expansion we use an integral
equation similar to that proposed by gaveau and schulman [18] for the one-
dimensional -potential:

k(x, y; t) = k0(x, y; t) +z t

0

dsz

dz k0(x, z; t  s)v (z)k(z, y; s)

(12)

where k0(x, y; t) denotes the heat kernel corresponding to the operator d0 with
v = 0.

the equation (12) has a solution in the form of the power series in v :

k(x, y; t) = k0(x, y; t) +



xn=1z t

0

dsnz sn

dsn1 . . .z s2

dzn . . .z

dz1

k0(x, zn; t  sn)v (zn)k0(zn, zn1; sn  sn1) . . . v (z1)k0(z1, y; s1) . (13)
the equation (12) can be obtained formally as a limiting case of the smooth
potential. instead of investigating this limiting procedure we prefer to check di-
rectly that the heat kernel dened by (12) satises the heat equation (8) with the
initial condition (9) and boundary conditions which follow from (6) and (7). the
initial condition (9) is evident from the eq. (13). only the rst term contributes
at t = 0 if x, y 6 . the heat equation (8) can be checked by a direct calculation.
the rst of the matching conditions (6) just expresses the fact that the heat
kernel k0(x, y; t) is smooth enough. the second condition (7) is a bit less trivial.
let y 6 . then the following sequence of transformations holds:

the main advantage of the representation (13) is that the small t behavior of
k(x, y; t) is dened through the small t behavior of k0(x, y; t) which is known
in some detail. to simplify the notations we do not write down explicitly the
volume elements here and the parallel transport matrices later on. we also drop
all matrix indices.

we are interested in the integrated heat kernel k(t) = r dxk(x, x; t), where

we put the smearing function f = 1 for simplicity. the integration over x can be
performed by using the equation

zm

dx k0(x, y1; 1)k0(y2, x; 2) = k0(y1, y2; 1 + 2) ,

(14)

which follows from the evident operator identity e1d0e2d0 = e(1+2)d0. we
have

k(t) = k0(t) +

(15)

it is instructive to calculate explicitly several rst terms of the expansion (15).

in the linear order in v one immediately gets

k1(t) = tz

dzk0(z, z; t)v (z) .

(16)

this equation means that the liner order in v can be obtained from the asymp-
totic expansion for the heat kernel in which a smooth potential is replaced by the
singular one. such simple relation does not hold at higher orders in v .

in analyzing the order v 2 contributions we suppose that d0 is just the stan-
dard scalar laplacian in rm, neglect derivatives of v and suppose that  is at.
however, we turn to a bit more general case allowing  to be of dimension m k.
in this particular case k0(x, y; t) = (4t)m/2 exp((x  y)2/4t) and
k2(t) = (4) m+k

for k > 1 the integrals over s are divergent. this shows that the proposed
method can not be extended in particular to (r) potentials in rm with m  2
for which the expansion (11) is known to break down [16, 17]). return to the
subject of our study, k = 1. all integrals are easily calculated giving

k2(t) =

(4t)(m1)/2

8 z

dzv (z)2 + . . . ,

(18)

where we have omitted all higher order terms.

to calculate the other terms in the expansion (15) one can use the following
strategy. let us substitute the small s asymptotic expansion for the k0(x, y; s)

k0(x, y; s) 

exp((x, y)/2s)

(4s)m/a

(a(0)

0 (x, y) + sa(0)

2 (x, y) + . . .) ,

(19)

where (x, y) is the half square of the geodesic distance between x and y, a(0)
2i (x, y)
are the heat kernel coecients for the operator d0. contributions of largely
separated points to (15) are exponentially damped. therefore, we may expand
a(0)
2i (zj, zj1) and (zj, zj1) in taylor series in (zj  zj1). the potentials v (zj)
are to be expanded around certain point, say z1. at the end, the expression under
the integrals in (15) will become a sum of the monomials

exp(cid:18)


(z1  zn)2
4(t  s1 + sn)  . . . 
(z1  zn)n1

(20)

where i (n ) is a local invariant functional of v , geometric invariants and their
derivatives calculated at the point z1. negative powers of (sj  sj1) appear due
to the expansion of the (zj  zj1) in the exponentials. it is easy to see that
mj  nj/2.
integrals over zi, except for the last one over z1, can be calculated with the
help of the relation

with positive real parameters  and . note that eq. (21) is just a particular case
of (14) when d0 is the at space laplacian. integrals of even powers of (x  y1)
with the same exponential weight are obtained by dierentiation of (21) with
respect to . odd powers of x can be integrated by using the following obvious
relation

before integrating over sj let us introduce rescaled variables sj = sj/t. this
enables us to extract an overall power of the proper time t.
integrals over sj
will give just numerical factors. one can easily see that the strongest possible
singularity of the integrand has the form ((1  sn + s1) . . . (s2  s1)) 1
2 . this
singularity is integrable. hence the integral over sj always exists. after all the
integrations have been done one obtains r dz1i (n )(v, . . . ; z1) multiplied by a
numerical coecient and a power of t.

generalization of the procedure proposed in this section for the case of non-
unit smearing function f is obvious. therefore, we have demonstrated that for
the spectral problem considered in this paper the asymptotic expansion (11) is
valid where the coecients an(f, d) are integrals over m and  of local invariants.
volume terms are the same as in the heat kernel expansion for the operator d0.

3 penetrable spherical shell

before calculating the heat kernel expansion for generic form of the operator d
consider a particular case of the constant potential v with the support on a
spherical shell of the radius r:

v (x) = 


r

(r  r) .

(23)

here r is the radial coordinate. let d0 in (1) be the standard scalar laplacian
in rm. after separating the angular variables the eigenvalue equation takes the
form

(m  1)

r


r

l(l + m  2)

r2

(cid:19)  = k2 ,

(24)

where l = 0, 1, 2, . . . is the orbital momentum. after the substitution (r) =
r(2m)/2(r) the equation takes the form

(cid:18)

r2

r

+

2

r2(cid:19)  = k2 ,

(25)

where the notation  = l + m2

is introduced.

using the standard techniques [19], the zeta function associated with this

operator can be written in the form

(s) =



z

0

dt
t

ts
(s)

k(t) ,

(26)

where k(t) is the integrated heat kernel. the function (s)(s) has simple poles
in s = d
2, 2, . . .) whose residua are determined by the expansion of
the heat kernel for t  0. it reads

2  n (n = 0, 1

k(t)  xn0

ant(nm)/2 .

7

(27)

it can be easily seen that the coecients are related to the residua by means of

an = res

s = mn

2

(s) (s) .

(28)

these heat kernel coecients can be obtained by calculating the zeta function
starting from the dierential equation, eq. (25). the zeta function of the oper-
ator d can be expressed in the form

(s) =

sin s





xl=0

dl



z

0

dk k2s 
k

ln fl(ik) ,

(29)

where fl(k) is the jost function of the scattering problem corresponding to the
operator d and

dl =

(2l + m  2) (l + m  3)!

l! (m  2)!

m  3

(30)

is the multiplicity of the orbital eigenvalues. this representation, as it stands, is
valid for s > m

2 . the jost function reads [13]

fl(ik) = 1 + i(k)k(k) .

(31)

in eq. (29) the contribution resulting from the empty space (it is independent
from ) is dropped. by this reason there is no contribution corresponding to the
coecient a0 there.

in fact, we need the residua of the function (s)(s). these are delivered
when inserting the uniform asymptotic expansion for k   and l   of
the jost function into eq. (29). the latter can be obtained simply by inserting
the known expansions of the bessel functions into (31). this expansion can be
written in the form

ln fl(ik) = xn,i

xn,i ti n .

(32)

here, n = 1, . . . , nm, and nm is the number of the highest heat kernel coecient
requested to be calculated. the coecients xn.i are numbers, some rst given in

the appendix. the notation t = p1 + (k/)2 is used. when inserting (32) into
the r.h.s. of eq. (29), the change of variables k  k can be made after what
the expression factorizes. the integral can be calculated easily. it reads

the sum over l takes the form

(33)

(34)

the functions (d, n) can be expressed in terms of riemann and hurwitz zeta
functions. they are shown in the appendix.

now the heat kernel coecients can be expressed in the form

the sum over i runs from i = n to i = n + 4((cid:2) n+1

standard computer systems for analytical calculations. as a results, we obtain
that a1 = 0 in any dimension. other coecients read for m = 3:

4 calculation of the heat kernel asymptotics

the information on the general structure of the heat kernel asymptotic obtained
in sec. 2 can be summarized in the following lemma.
lemma 1. 1) let n (f ) = f;m...m be the th normal covariant derivative. there
exist invariant local formulae an,(y, d) so that:

an(f, d) = {an(f, d0; x)}[m] + { x0n1

n (f )an,(y, d)}[]

(41)

2) if we expand an, with respect to a weyl basis, the coecients depend on the
dimension m only through a normalizing constant.
3) consider a transformation which changes the sign before the m-th components
of all vector and tensor elds and reverses the sign of the extrinsic curvature lab.
under this transformation an,  (1)an,.
4) in the linear order of v

an(f, d) = {v (z)



e(z)

an(f, d0)}[] .

(42)

proof. first assertion is now evident. volume terms {an(f, d0; x)}[m] are given
in the appendix b. one can also observe that coecients before monomials con-
structed from the geometric invariants depend on the dimension m only through
the factor (4)m/2. a more simple way to prove the second assertion is to con-
sider product spaces m = s1  m1 and  = s1  1 exactly repeating the
corresponding proof for manifolds with boundaries [9]. assertion 3) follows from
the fact that we can repeat all calculation of section 2 with the replacement
xm  xm. the last statement of lemma 1 is just a trivial generalization of
the equation (16) for non-unit smearing function f .
indeed, it is sucient to
represent the variation on the r.h.s. of (42) as



e(z)

k0(t) = zm

dxz t

0

ds f (x)k0(z, x; t  s)k0(x, z; s) .

(43)

assertion 4) is now evident.

10

now we can determine several rst heat kernel coecient up to a few yet

undetermined constants.
lemma 2. there exist universal constants c3,1, . . . , c5,10 such that

a0(f, d) = a0(f, d0)
a1(f, d) = 0
a2(f, d) = a2(f, d0) + (4)m/2{f v }[]
a3(f, d) = (4)(m1)/2{c3,1f v 2}[]

proof. according to lemma 1.1) and 2) any coecient an contains all local
invariants of appropriate dimension. some of the invariants, like e.g. f v laa,
f;mv etc are ruled out by lemma 1.3). all terms linear in v are determined by
lemma 1.4).
lemma 3. c3,1 = 1
proof. the coecients c3,1, c4,1, c5,1, c5,5 and c5,6 are easily calculated using the
example of the delta-potential on the sphere of the previous section. to calculate
the coecient c5,4 consider the case then e = e1 is a constant proportional to
the unit matrix. in this case k(f ; t) = k(f ; t)|e=0 exp(te). this immediately
gives c5,4 = c3,1 = 1
8.
several more universal constants can be calculated by a reduction to dirichlet
and neumann boundary value problems. all necessary denitions and explicit
expressions for the heat kernel coecient for that problems can be found in the
appendix b.
lemma 4. 1) let m =   [a, a]. let m = m and let all geometric

5 conclusions

in the present paper we have studied the heat kernel expansion for for an ope-
rator of laplace type in the presence of semitransparent boundaries. we have
determined the general form of the asymptotic expansion. namely, we proved
the validity of the asymptotic series (11). we have calculated explicitly several
rst terms of the expansion for the most general operator of laplace type and
arbitrary boundary potential. we believe that this is the most complete study
done in this eld so far.

our methods of deriving the heat kernel coecients admit extensive cross-
checking. most of the universal constants can be calculated by at least two
independent methods. if needed, one can calculate the higher coecients as well.
as possible generalizations we can suggest the  potentials or even general four-
parameter family on matching conditions [1] on the hypersurface . another
possible development of the present results can be the renormalization of quan-
tum eld theory in the presence of singular interactions [21]. we believe that
semitransparent boundaries provide a more adequate framework for the renor-
malization than abrupt boundary conditions of dirichlet or neumann type.
for most recent work on renormalization with singular potentials see [17].

appendix b

in this appendix we give expressions for the heat kernel coecients for the dirich-
let and neumann boundary value problems. let m be a smooth compact rie-
mannian manifold with smooth boundary m. let s be an endomorphism on
vm and let ;m be a covariant derivative of  with respect to inward unit nor-
mal. we dene the modied neumann boundary operator b+ and the dirichlet
boundary operator b by

b+ := (;m + s)|m

b := |m

(51)

we set s = 0 for the dirichlet boundary conditions to have a uniform notations.

we need only the case of totally geodesic boundary (lab = 0). we drop
certain boundary invariants which vanish under conditions of lemma 4. several
rst heat kernel coecients are [20, 14, 22]
