abstract

we present the most general family of stationary point-like solutions of pure
n = 4, d = 4 supergravity characterized by completely independent electric and
magnetic charges, mass, angular momentum and nut charge plus the asymptotic
values of the scalars. it includes, for specic values of the charges all previously known
bps and non-bps, extreme and non-extreme black holes and taub-nut solutions.
as a family of solutions, it is manifestly invariant under t and s duality transfor-
mations and exhibits a structure related to the underlying special geometry structure
of the theory.

finally, we study briey the black-hole-type subfamily of metrics and give explicit

expressions for their entropy and temperature.

introduction

the low-energy eective action of the heterotic string compactied on t 6 is that of pure
n = 4, d = 4 supergravity coupled to n = 4 super yang-mills. it is possible to truncate
consistently this theory to the simpler pure supergravity theory. from the string theory
point of view the truncation consists in introducing always equal numbers of kaluza-klein
and winding modes for each cycle. the truncated theory still exhibits s and t dualities
and, thus, pure n = 4, d = 4 supergravity provides a simple framework in which to study
classical solutions which still can be considered as solutions of the full eective string
theory. the bosonic sector of this theory is also known in the literature as dilaton-axion
gravity or as einstein-maxwell dilaton-axion theory when only a single vector eld
is considered.

perhaps the most interesting solutions of the 4-dimensional string eective action are
the black-hole type ones3 since they constitute the best testing ground for the quantum
gravity theory contained in string theory. it is believed that a good quantum gravity
theory should be able to explain in terms of microscopic degrees of freedom the values of
the macroscopic thermodynamical quantities found classically and semiclassically. there
has been some success in this respect for supersymmetric (bps-saturated) and near-
supersymmetric black holes although the results are to be interpreted carefully since the
supersymmetric limit is singular in many respects.

a great deal of eort has been put in nding the most general families of black-hole
solutions whose thermodynamical properties should exhibit also invariance (or, rather,
covariance) under the duality symmetries of the theory and covering the supersymmetric
and non-supersymmetric cases and, further, covering stationary (not static) cases.

the rst two examples of this kind of families of solutions were found in ref. [3]4. the
rst family of solutions corresponds to non-supersymmetric, static black-hole solutions
and the second to supersymmetric, static, multi-black-hole solutions of n = 4, d = 4
supergravity. under the dualities of the theory, solutions of each family transform into
other solutions of the same family, with the same functional form. thus, only the values
of the charges and moduli transform. the supersymmetric solutions are given in terms of
two constrained complex harmonic functions.

dierent extensions and properties of these solutions in the context of dilaton-axion

gravity were later obtained in refs. [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18].

a main step forward was given in ref. [19] where it was realized that the form of
the above supersymmetric solutions was dictated the special geometry of the associated
n = 2, d = 4 supergravity theory. the two complex harmonic functions are associated to
coordinates and certain components of the metric are associated to the kahler potential
and the holomorphic vector.
it was found that similar ansatzs could be used in other
n = 2, d = 4 supergravity theories with dierent matter multiplets and kahler potentials.
finally, in refs. [20, 21] the most general supersymmetric black-hole-type solutions of

4in the much simpler context of pure n = 2, d = 4 supergravity the iwp solutions of refs. [4, 5, 6]

also have this property.

pure n = 4, d = 4 supergravity (swip solutions) where found. the only dierence with
those of ref. [3] is that the complex harmonic functions are now completely arbitrary and
unconstrained. this automatically allows for the introduction of angular momentum and
nut charge in the solutions. in fact the constraint simply meant that these charges were
not allowed.

similar supersymmetric solutions were later found for other n = 2, d = 4 supergravity

theories [22] with vector multiplets.

for the non-supersymmetric solutions of ref. [3] the story has been dierent since
no clear relation with the underlying special geometry was established.
in ref. [23] a
general recipe for obtaining non-supersymmetric solutions from supersymmetric solutions
in n = 2, d = 4 supergravity theories, previously used in other contexts, was shown to
work for static black holes: one simply has to deform the metric with the introduction of
a non-supersymmetry (non-extremality) function.

what has to be done in more general cases (stationary, for instance) is far from clear
and general duality-invariant families of stationary non-supersymmetric solutions are not
available in the literature and no recipe to build them is known.

in this paper we present such a general duality-invariant family of stationary non-
supersymmetric solutions of pure n = 4, d = 4 supergravity characterized by completely
independent electric and magnetic charges, mass, angular momentum and nut charge
plus the asymptotic values of the scalar elds5.

the rest of the paper is organized as follows: in section 1 we describe the bosonic sector
of n = 4, d = 4 supergravity theory. in section 2 we give and study the general family of
solutions we relate it to others already known. in section 3, we focus our attention in the
black hole type subfamily of metrics and calculate the explicit values for their entropy and
the temperature, showing that also these quantities can be put in a manifestly duality-
invariant form. section 4 contains our conclusions. the appendices contain the denitions
of the dierent charges we use and their duality-invariant combinations.

1.1 description of the system and equations of motion

the bosonic sector of pure n = 4, d = 4 supergravity contains two real scalar elds (axion
a and dilaton ), six abelian vector elds a(n)
(which we generalize to an arbitrary number


5when we talk about general solutions we are implicitly excluding the possibility of having primary
scalar hair. solutions with primary scalar hair are in all known cases (see, e.g. [24]), singular (providing
evidence for the never proven no-hair theorem) and, being interested in true black holes with event
horizons covering all the physical singularities, these cases are not important for us and in the solutions
which we are going to present the scalar charges are always completely determined by the u (1) charges.
nevertheless, it should be pointed out that more general solutions (some of them supersymmetric) which
include primary scalar hair must exist and should be related to the ones given here by formal t duality in
the time direction [25].

the axion and dilaton are combined into a single complex scalar eld, the axidilaton :

this is an electromagnetic duality rotation that acts on the dilaton. from the point of
view of string theory, this is the 4-dimensional string coupling constant. hence the name
s duality.

furthermore the n (6 in the sugra theory) vector elds can be so(n)-rotated. these
are t duality transformations (perturbative from the string theory point of view). the
full duality group is, then sl(2, r)  so(n).

2 the general solution

we now present the family of solutions. all the elds in our solutions may be expressed in
terms of two xed complex harmonic functions of the three dimensional euclidean space,
h1 and h2, a set of n complex constants k(n), a non-extremality function w and a
background 3-dimensional metric (3)ij. in all of them appear the physical constants dened
in appendix b. only , the axidilaton charge, is not independent. the harmonic functions
are

h1 = 12

where 2  x2 + y2 + (z + i)2 is the usual complex radial coordinate, and  is an arbitrary,
unphysical real number related to the duality transformation of these functions under
sl(2, r) (see the explanation in section 2.1). the complex constants are

k(n) =  12

ei

m(n) + (n)
|m|2  ||2

.

(2.2)

in supersymmetric cases (e.g. ref. [21]) it is useful to introduce oblate spheroidal co-

ordinates which are related to the ordinary cartesian ones by:

5

x = r2 + 2 sin  cos  ,
y = r2 + 2 sin  sin  ,

z = r cos  .

(2.3)




the three dimensional euclidean metric is written in these coordinates in the following
way:

d~x 2 =

r2 + 2 cos2 

r2 + 2

dr2 +(cid:0)r2 + 2 cos2 (cid:1) d2 +(cid:0)r2 + 2(cid:1) sin2  d2 .

(2.4)

in terms of (2.3) the radial coordinate  that appears in (2.1) may be expressed as
 = r + i cos . furthermore, in these new coordinates, the non-extremality function
has a simple form:

where r0, given by

w = 1 

r 2
0

r2 + 2 cos2

n

0 = |m|2 + ||2

(2.6)

is usually called extremality parameter in the static cases. in stationary cases, though,
r0 = 0 means that the solution is supersymmetric but in general it is not an extreme black
hole (nor a black hole). thus, a more appropriate name is supersymmetry parameter. the
extremality parameter will be r2

0 = r2

0  2.

finally, the last ingredient is the background metric (3)ij

d~x 2 = (3)ijdxidxj

=

r2 + 2 cos2   r2

r2 + 2  r2

dr2 + (r2 + 2 cos2   r 2

0 ) sin2 d2 ,

(2.7)
which diers from (2.4) in non-supersymmetric (r0 6= 0) cases and is not at7. this is an
important qualitative dierence between the usual supersymmetric iwp-type [4, 5] metrics
(e.g. those of refs. [6, 20, 21]) and our solution.

we can now describe the solutions. they take the form

for  = 0 the  term in eq. (2.11) has to be eliminated and the equation tales the form

we can also write our solution in the standard form used to describe general rotating

black holes, which will be useful to describe the structure of the singularities:

2 ,

(2.15)

this completes the description of the general solution. now we are going to describe

its properties.

2.1 duality properties

we can study the eect of duality transformations in two ways which are fully equivalent
in this family of solutions: we can study the eect of the transformations of the elds or
simply the eect of the transformations on the physical constants. one of the main features
of our family of solutions is precisely this equivalence: we can simply transform the physical
constants (adding primes) because the functional form of the solutions always will remain
invariant.

let us, then, study the eect of sl(2, r) transformations of the charges m, (n),  and

moduli 0 in appendix b.

both the complex harmonic functions h1,2 and the complex constants k(n) are dened
up to a phase: if we multiply h1,2 by a constant phase and the k(n)s by the opposite one,
the solution remains unchanged. we have made this fact explicit by including the arbitrary
angle  in their denition.

as it can take any value, in particular we can require it to change in the following way

when performing an sl(2, r) rotation:

(2.16)
with this choice the k(n)s are left invariant, while the pair h1,2 transforms as a doublet:

ei  ei arg(c0+d)ei .

(cid:18) h1
h2 (cid:19) = (cid:18) h1

h2 (cid:19) .

(2.17)

h1,2 appear only through two invariant combinations: e2u and e(cid:0)h1d h2  h2dh1(cid:1).

the remaining building blocks of the solution are  and w which are invariant if the
supersymmetry parameter r0 is invariant. this (rst proven in ref. [28]) is shown in
appendix c.

under so(n) the k(n)s transform as vectors, as they should, and everything else is

invariant.

the relation of the form of these solutions to n = 2 special geometry is the same
as in the supersymmetric case [19, 21] and we will not repeat here that discussion. the
only dierence is the introduction of the background metric (3), and the functions , w
which deform the supersymmetric solution but have no special meaning from the special
geometry point of view.

8

2.2 reduction to other known solutions

we can now relate our solution to those less general found in the literature. we can con-
sider two types of solutions: supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric. the most general
family of supersymmetric black-hole type solutions of n = 4, d = 4 supergravity (swip
solutions) was found in refs. [20, 21]. due to the existence of supersymmetry, the family
contains two arbitrary harmonic functions. to describe point-like solutions one chooses
harmonic functions with a single pole. our solutions reduce precisely to these when the
supersymmetry parameter vanishes: r0 = 0. as shown in appendix c in the r0 = 0 limit
at least one of the two possible bogomolnyi bounds of n = 4 supergravity are saturated.
in this case w = 1,  = 0, (3) becomes at (in spheroidal coordinates) and we recover
the structure of the swip solutions. the swip solutions always saturate one bound due
to the constraints that the constants k(n) satisfy

n

(k(n))2 = 0 ,

xn=1

|k(n)|2 = 1
2 .

(2.18)

while, in our case there is no constraint on the charges (apart from the one on the scalar
charge, associated to the non-hair theorem)

(2.19)

in ref. [21] it is shown how this solution reduces to supersymmetric solutions with an-
gular momentum, nut charge etc. only some of the static ones (those with 1/4 of the
supersymmetries unbroken) are black holes with a regular horizon. these include extreme
reissner-nordstrom black holes and their axion-dilaton generalizations [29, 30, 31, 32, 28].
the rest have naked singularities.

as for the non-supersymmetric solutions, the non-extreme taub-nut axion-dilaton
solutions of ref. [7] are clearly covered by our general solution. further, in ref. [9] were
found general point-like solutions for a theory with only one vector eld (axion-dilaton
gravity). we can see that our solutions reduce to these ones by setting n = 1. the prin-
cipal dierence is that, in this particular case, we can t the analogous of expression (b.10)
in the denition (2.6) for the extremality parameter, giving

0,n =1 = (|m|  ||)2 ,
r 2

(2.20)

9

and inserting this into the metric (2.8) we get exactly eqs. (31-35) of ref. [9] up to a shift
in the radial coordinate. although one can immediately see that the functional form of the
metric (2.8) does not change very much from that found in [9], somewhat dierent results
appear when considering multiple vector elds, due to the constraints that the physical
parameters obey when only one vector eld is present. this analysis was already done in
detail in [21], and we refer to this paper for further discussion.

a generalization of the non-extreme solutions of [9] for the same theory, but with an
arbitrary number of vector elds (i.e., the same theory we are treating), was found in [16].
however, the solutions reported there concern only the static case, and therefore the total
number of independent physical parameters is 2n + 4. as it was shown in that paper, the
metric for the static case is of the reissner-nordstrom-type, but with a variable mass
factor. it can be seen that, taking the static ( = 0) limit of our metric (2.8), and shifting

the radial coordinate by a quantity m +p||2  n2, we recover the same solution of [16]

(eq. (7.6) of that reference) up to redenitions in the dierent constants parametrizing the
solution.

finally, we observe that setting the axidilaton charge equal to zero (which can be done
with appropriate combinations of electric and magnetic charges) in eqs. (2.15-2.14), we
recover the kerr-newman solution in boyer-lindquist coordinates (but with a constant
shift equal to the mass in the radial coordinate. see, e.g., refs.[33, 34]).

3 black-hole-type solutions

3.1 singularities

we now carry out the analysis of the structure of our solutions. first, we proceed to study
the dierent types of singularities of the metric. due to the standard form of g in terms
of  and , the singularities in terms of these functions are those of all kerr-type metrics,
i.e., we have coordinate singularities at

and a curvature singularity at

 = 0 ,

 = 0 ,

 = 0 .

(3.1)

(3.2)

the rst of eqs. (3.1) gives the possible horizons. to study the dierent cases, let us
shift the radial coordinate to recover the boyer-lindquist coordinates in which this kind
of solutions are usually given. if we perform the following rescaling:

then  and  of (2.15) become

r  r  m

(3.3)

10

2 ,

 = (r  m)2  r0
 = r2 + 2 cos2   ||2 ,

(3.4)

where we also have made the nut charge n equal to zero in order to obtain black-hole-type
solutions. in studying the singularities given by  = 0 we have three cases to consider:

a) r2

0 < 0 ,

(r0

2 < 2) .

here  = 0 has no real solutions, we have a naked singularity at  = 0 and no true
black hole interpretation is possible. this is the case of supersymmetric (r0 = 0) rotating
( 6= 0) black holes.
b) r2

2 > 2) .

0 > 0 ,

(r0

in this case we have two horizons placed at

to see if in this case we have a true black hole we must verify that the singularity is always
hidden by the event horizon. the region where the singularity is placed is given by the
following equation:

r = m  r0 .

(3.5)

 = 0  r2

sing = ||2  2 cos2  .

(3.6)

this is not the usual ring singularity, but a more complicated 2-dimensional surface
in general. depending on the values of the charges, this can have the topology of the
surface of a torus (maybe degenerate in certain cases to the surfaces of two concentric
ellipsoids). whatever its shape is, it is always conned in the region

while, on the other hand, the would-be event horizon

sing  ||2 ,
r2

(3.7)

(3.8)
and it will cover the singularity if m > ||. using the value of || in terms of the other
charges it is easy to prove

r+ = m + r0 > m ,

(|m|  ||)2 > 2 .

(3.9)

we can now distinguish two cases:

i) |m|  || > || .

11

in this case (setting n = 0) the horizon covers the singularity and the object is a true
black hole. using the expressions in appendix c it is possible to prove that this happens
when both

which is the case allowed by supersymmetry (but not supersymmetric).

|m| > |z1,2| ,

(3.10)

ii) |m|  || < || .

in this case there are naked singularities. this is the case forbidden by supersymmetry

since one can show that in it both bogomolnyi bounds are simultaneously violated

c) r2

0 = 0 ,

(r0

2 = 2) .

|m| < |z1,2| .

this is the extremal case, and here we have a single would-be horizon placed at

again, we can distinguish two cases

i) |m|  || > || ,

|m| > |z1,2| .

r = m .

(3.11)

(3.12)

in this case the singularity is inside the horizon and we have a true extreme rotating
black hole. this is the case allowed by supersymmetry (not supersymmetric unless  = 0).

i) |m|  || < || ,

|m| < |z1,2| .

the singularity is outside the horizon and this is not a black hole.

3.2 entropy and temperature

we can now calculate the physical quantities associated to the true black-hole-type solu-
tions. the entropy of the bh can be worked out by a straightforward computation of the
area of the event horizon. this gives the following result:

so that for the bekenstein-hawking entropy of the black hole we get, in units such that
g =  = c = 1

ahorizon = 4(cid:0)r 2

+ + 2  ||2(cid:1) ,

(3.13)

(3.14)

where i2 is the quadratic duality invariant dened in eq. (a.7). it is useful to have the
expression of the entropy in terms of the mass and supersymmetry central charges

s = (cid:0)2m2 + 2mr0  i2(cid:1) ,

12

s = n(m2  |z1|2) + (m2  |z2|2) + 2p(m2  |z1|2)(m2  |z2|2)  j 2 .o .

for vanishing angular momentum j = 0, this expression can be further simplied to

(3.15)

s = h(cid:0)m2  |z1|2(cid:1)1/2 +(cid:0)m2  |z2|2(cid:1)1/2i2

,

(3.16)

which means that, if we believe the extrapolation of this formula to all extreme cases,
the entropy vanishes if and only if both bogomolnyi bounds are saturated and 1/2 of the
supersymmetries are unbroken [32].

when any one of the two possible bogomolnyi bounds is saturated (for j = 0) the
entropy is proportional to the dierence between the modulus of the two central charges,
which is proportional to the quartic duality invariant i4 dened in eq. (a.8), which is
moduli-independent.

the temperature can be calculated imposing the regularity of the metric near the event
horizon in imaginary time. following the standard prescription [35], we must shift the time
t and the rotation parameter  to the values t  i and   i respectively. this yields
the euclidean section of the metric, and the absence of conical singularities at the event
horizon in imaginary time requires the identication (, )  ( + h,   hh ), where
h is the euclidean angular velocity of the event horizon and h is the inverse hawking
temperature. for the (real) angular velocity of the horizon we have the following result:

and so we obtain, in a perfectly straightforward way, the value for the hawking temperature
of the black hole:

th =

r0

.

(3.18)

for j = 0 the temperature always vanishes in the supersymmetric limit, except in the
case in which 1/2 of the supersymmetries are going to be left unbroken. in that case the
limit is simply not well dened.

4 conclusions

we have given a new set of solutions of pure n = 4, d = 4 supergravity which are beyond
the bps limit (in both directions) and which constitute the most general stationary point-
like solution of this theory, since all the conserved charges are present in our solution, and
all of them can take completely arbitrary values8. these solutions include black holes as
well as taub-nut spacetimes, bhs being non-extremal in the general case. we have also

8the only possible addition would be primary scalar hair, but we are not interested in that kind of

solutions.

shown that our family of solutions, and also the thermodynamic quantities associated to
the bhs, are duality-invariant.

from a more technical point of view, we hope that the ansatz providing the solution
(basically characterized by the introduction of the non-extremality function w and the
non-at three-dimensional metric (2.7) as background space) will prove helpful for the
task of nding more non-extreme black holes s in other models, in particular, in those
arising from more realistic compactications of string theory, like compactications on
calabi-yau spaces, orbifolds, etc.

a conserved charges and duality invariants

the non-geometrical conserved charges of this theory are associated to the u(1) vector
elds. there are electric charges q(n) whose conservation law is associated to the maxwell
equation and are dened, for point-like objects by the asymptotic behavior of the t  r
components of the sl(2, r)-dual eld strengths

 f (n)

tr 

q(n)

(a.1)

and magnetic charges p(n) whose conservation law is associated to the bianchi identity and
are dened, for point-like objects by the asymptotic behavior of the t  r components of
the eld strengths

f (n)

tr 

p(n)

(a.2)

these charges can be arranged in so(n) vectors ~q,~p and these can be arranged in

sl(2, r) doublets

under s and t duality transformations , r, this charge vector transforms according

and it is an so(n) singlet.

we can now construct two expressions which are manifestly sl(2, r)so(n)-invariant
and that will be useful later to express physical results in a manifestly duality-invariant
way. the rst one is quadratic in the charges:

0 
~p (cid:1)m1

where m0 is the constant asymptotic value of m.

i2 (cid:0) ~q

the second invariant we will use is :

which is quartic in the charges. observe that i2 is moduli-dependent and i4 is moduli-
independent.

b physical parameters

here we explain our notation for charges and moduli used in the solutions. m stands for the
adm mass, and n for the nut charge. they appear combined into the complex constant
m dened by

the rotation parameter  is  = j/m, where j is the angular momentum.
these charges are singlets under all duality transformations.

m = m + in .

the asymptotic behavior of the axidilaton is characterized by the constant asymptotic
value 0 = a0 + ie20, where a0 is the constant asymptotic value of the axion and 0 that
of the dilaton. the axidilaton charge is denoted by  and, thus

  0  ie20 2



.

(b.2)

(where  is a radial coordinate).

0 transforms as  under duality transformations and  is as so(n) singlet and, under

sl(2, r)

we nd it convenient to use, instead of the conserved charges q(n) and p(n) dened in

appendix a, the constants q(n) and p (n) dened by

 = e2i arg(c0+d) .

c central charge matrix eigenvalues

the supersymmetry parameter r0 can be expressed in terms of the two dierent skew
eigenvalues of the central charge matrix of n = 4, d = 4 supergravity [36, 37] z1,2. their
absolute values can be expressed in terms of the electric and magnetic charges in the
following way:

|z1,2|2 = 1

and in terms of the invariants i2, i4 dened in eqs. (a.7,a.8) as follows

,

(c.1)

with the help of these expressions and those of the previous appendices we can write

the supersymmetry parameter r0 as follows:

|z1,2|2 = 1

r2
0 =

|m|2(cid:0)|m|2  |z1|2(cid:1)(cid:0)|m|2  |z2|2(cid:1) .

(c.3)

this last equation makes explicit the fact that, if and only if r2

0=0, one of the two

possible supersymmetry bogomolnyi bounds

is saturated.

the following expression is also useful

|m|2  |z1,2|2 ,

|z1z2|2 = |m|2||2 .
