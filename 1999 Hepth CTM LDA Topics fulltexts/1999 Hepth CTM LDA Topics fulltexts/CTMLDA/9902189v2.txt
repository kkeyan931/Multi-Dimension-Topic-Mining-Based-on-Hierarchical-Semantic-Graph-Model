the deformed two-dimensional black hole

j. teschner

abstract. a deformation of the wave equation on a two-dimensional black hole is considered
as a toy-model for possible gravitational or stringy nonlocal eects. the deformed wave-equation
allows for an initial-value problem despite being nonlocal. the singularity present in the classical
geometry is resolved by the deformation, so that propagation of a wave-packet can be continued
through the classically singular region, ultimately reaching another asymptotically at region.

1. introduction

it is an important open question whether a notion of locality can be maintained in fundamental
theories involving gravity such as e.g. string theory. this problem appears to be closely related
to the question whether (pseudo-) riemannian geometry still makes sense down to arbitrarily
small distances.

arguments have been put forward that indicate the impossibility of measuring arbitrarily
small distances when combining quantum theory and general relativity, see e.g. [dfr][fgr]. if
riemannian geometry can not be measured then it becomes questionable whether it is a useful
concept for the description of physical situations in which space-time uncertainties are relevant.
the status of locality in string theory is unclear due to the absence of a fundamental,
background-independent formulation. there are hints indicating that strings cannot probe arbi-
trarily small distances due to quantum uctuations of their shape, which are related to the fact
that eective actions for the elds corresponding to the low energy states of the string are gener-
ically1 highly nonlocal. more recent developments have exhibited on the one hand d-branes as
probes that sometimes are able to resolve smaller distance scales than strings [dkps]2, but have
on the other hand discovered new hints towards fundamental nonlocalities from non-perturbative
dualities such as the dualities between strings on anti-de sitter (ads) spaces and conformal eld
theories conjectured by maldacena (see e.g. [bdhm]).

having available more general frameworks for the formulation of eld theories that take into
account fundamental space-time uncertainties or nonlocal eects may be an important ingredi-
ent for the further development of gravitational or string theories. one rather general framework
that has been proposed in this context is given by the noncommutative geometry [co], where
non-commutativity of the operator algebra supposed to describe position measurements prevents
localization to arbitrarily small distances. one thereby naturally obtains space-time uncertain-
ties as e.g. in the explicit example proposed in [dfr].

1if ls/lr is not very small, where ls is the string length and lr denotes the characteristic curvature radius
2the situation for ls/lr  o(1) it is not clear to the author.

it has been proposed in [d] that d0-branes
behave like point-particles in some regime with ls/lr  o(1) so that the metric probed by these objects would
dene the pseudo-riemannian structure of a background. on the other hand it appears to the author that the
description of d-brane eective actions in terms of noncommutative geometry that was found in some specic
backgrounds (reviewed in [d]) should be generic rather than exceptional.

there is a generalization of the concept of geodesic distance for noncommutative spaces
[co][fg], which is based on the observation that the geodesic distance on a riemannian mani-
fold m can be reconstructed from the algebraic data (a,h, ), where a is the algebra of (say)
smooth, bounded functions on m, h may be taken as the space l2(m, dv) on which a acts
as multiplication operators and  is the laplacian on m considered as a self-adjoint operator
on h. physically this simply means that the geodesic distance can be reconstructed from the
quantum mechanics of point particles on m. this observation leads to a natural denition of
geodesic distance for more general choices of data (a,h, ), in which the algebra a may be
noncommutative. a possibility that does not seem to have attracted much attention is the case
in which a is still commutative, but  is replaced by some other, maybe nonlocal, self-adjoint
operator on h.
unfortunately, an analogous generalization in the case of minkowskian signature metrics does
not seem to exist presently (to the authors knowledge). physically one might guess that recon-
structing the riemannian metric from the quantum mechanics on m should be replaced by a
study of propagation of wave-packets according to the covariant wave equation. this suggests
that it should ultimately be possible to dene generalizations of pseudo-riemannian structures
from data such as (a,h, (cid:3)), where now (cid:3) is some generalization of the covariant wave operator.
it is in this spirit that deformations of the covariant wave equation will be considered as dening
a deformed pseudo-riemannian geometry.

alternatively, one may simply take the point of view that nonlocal deformations of the co-
variant wave equation are one way to parametrize certain modications of the propagation of
elds on a manifold due to gravitational/stringy nonlocal eects.

the present paper will describe an example of a nonlocal deformation of the wave equation
in the geometry of a two-dimensional black hole. in this example the generalization appears
exclusively in the nonlocality of the deformed covariant wave operator, the underlying alge-
bra of functions is commutative. however, the specic deformation studied has its roots in a
noncommutative quantum deformation of the algebra of functions on sl(2, r) and was found
by generalizing the relation between sl(2, r) and the two-dimensional black hole that exists
classically (e.g.
[wi][dvv]), as will be further discussed elsewhere. by similar constructions
one can alternatively obtain noncommutative deformations of euclidean/minkowskian ads3,
the btz-black hole, and the two-dimensional euclidean black hole.

the paper starts with a presentation of some results on wave propagation and scattering in
the case of the classical two-dimensional black hole. some important results had been obtained
in [dvv], but for the purpose of comparison with the deformed case it appeared to be necessary
to complete (e.g. by the solution of the cauchy problem) and generalize (to arbitrary mass) the
discussion therein.

the following section then carries out a study of the deformed case along similar lines as in the
classical case. in order to focus on the physically interesting aspects and to keep the discussion
brief, the basic technical results, being analogous to the classical case, are only announced. one
should note however that their proof requires methods rather dierent from the well-known
techniques that can be used in the classical case, so a full account of the technicalities will be
given elsewhere.

2. the two-dimensional black hole

a two-dimensional analogue of the black hole 3 can be found as solution of the equations of

motion for the dilaton gravity theory dened by the action

(1)

it is given by the following expressions for metric and dilaton eld:

(2)

ds2 =

s =z d2xge(cid:16)r + ()2  8(cid:17).

,

 = log(1  uv).

one should note that the metric has all the characteristic features of a black hole: there
is a horizon at uv = 0 and a curvature singularity at uv = 1. the following gure shows the
penrose diagram of the fully extended geometry supplemented by regions behind the singularities
(regions iii and vi):

u

in the present paper only regions i, ii and iii will be considered, which is why the rest is
represented by dotted lines. one may consider the metric in regions i and ii as an idealization
of a black hole formed by gravitational collapse if one imposes the boundary condition that there
is no ux of matter from regions iv and v into ii and i respectively, cf. [un].

the corresponding wave operator reads

in order to solve the wave-equation (4) it is useful to introduce variables r = log(uv),

t = log(u/v) in which the covariant wave operator (cid:3) takes the form
(5)

(cid:3) = err(1 + er)r  (er + 1)2
t .

3see e.g. [wi][dvv] for more extensive discussions

4

j. teschner

the operator  can furthermore be brought into the form of a one-dimensional schrodinger
operator by considering the eld g = e/2f = 1 + erf instead of f . the wave equation for g
then reads

(cid:0)2
t + (cid:1)g = 0,

 = 2

r + v (r),

v (r) =

er

4(1 + er)2 + m2

er

1 + er .

any solution which at some xed time t allows expansion of g(r, t) and g(r, t)  tg(r, t) into
generalized eigenfunctions of the schrodinger operator  can then be written in the form

g(r, t) =z d() (cid:0)eitw(r) + e+it w(r)(cid:1)

with

hw(r) = 2w(r).

the eigenvalue equation for w(r) is brought into the form of a hypergeometric dierential
equation by w(r) = (x)i(1  x)1/2f(x), x = er. one has two linearly independent
solutions:

uk(r) = nkeir(1 + er)

2 + i(k  ), 1

2  i(k + ), 1  2i,er)

and its complex conjugate vk(r)  uk(r), where k is xed by the mass-shell condition 2  k2 =
m2, and nk is a normalization factor to be xed below. the asymptotic behavior for r  
corresponding to large spacelike distance from the black hole is given by plane waves:

1

2 f(cid:0) 1

(6)

uk(x)  nk(cid:0)b+(k)eikr + b(k)eikr(cid:1),

b(k) =

(1  2i)(2ik)
2(cid:0) 1
2  i(  k)(cid:1)

.

it can then be checked that  is essentially self-adjoint in l2(r): there are no square-integrable
eigenfunctions of , so the deciency indices vanish. it can furthermore be shown that the set
of generalized eigenfunctions {uk(x); k  r+}  {vk(x); k  r+} constitutes a plane wave basis
for l2(r). the normalization nk is nally given by
dr uk2(r)uk1(r) = 2(k2  k1),

dr uk2(r)vk1(r) = 0,

corresponding to normalizing the incoming plane wave in (6) to unity.

this yields existence and uniqueness of a solution to the cauchy-problem for suitable subspaces

in view of a similar phenomenon that will be found in the deformed case it may be worthwhile
noting that expansion into eigenfunction of  is possible for considerably more general choices of

the deformed two-dimensional black hole

subspaces t , s  t  l2(r) 4. moreover, the expression (7) still makes sense for ak = ak[g, g],
bk = bk[g, g] corresponding to initial data g,
g in t . but the resulting function g(r, t) will
then generically not be dierentiable; it can therefore be considered as a solution of the wave-
equation only in the distributional sense. this phenomenon is familiar from the simple case
2
t f = 2
xf even if f is
not dierentiable.

t f = 2

2.2. scattering in the black hole geometry. by the method of stationary phase it is possible
to show that for t   any solution (7) is asymptotic to a function gas(r, t) in the sense that

lim

tzr

dr |g(r, t)  gas(r, t)|2 = 0.

the function gas(r, t) is expressed in terms of ak, bk as follows

gas = gas

1 + gas

1 (gas

the functions gas

2 ) describe right- (left-) moving wave-packets coming in from h (i).

however, the right-moving plane waves at h represent an inow from region v into region
i. in order to be consistent with the interpretation of regions i/ii as being an idealization of a
black hole formed by gravitational collapse, it is necessary to impose the boundary condition of
vanishing gas

the scattering problem for a wave-packet with asymptotic form gin consists therefore in de-

1 corresponding to bk  0.

2.3. continuation into region ii. the continuation of the wave-packet (7) into region ii is
trivial when expressing the modes eituk(r) in terms of u, v-coordinates:
(9)
where uk(u, v) is analytic in v near the horizon v = 0. the expression
d (cid:0)uk(u, v)tkak + uk(u, v) tk ak(cid:1)

eituk(r)  uk(u, v) = u2if(cid:0) 1

2  i(k + ), 1  2i, uv(cid:1),

therefore denes a wave-packet f in the union of regions i and ii. this continuation becomes
unique by imposing the condition of vanishing on the boundary between regions iv and ii, which
is motivated by arguments analogous to those that motivated vanishing on h.
however, the singularity at uv = 1 prevents further continuation into region iii. technically
this follows from the fact that the modes uk(u, v) develop a singularity of the form log(1  uv).
predictability of the evolution of the wave-packet f breaks down at the singularity since there
is no unique way of dening log(x) for negative x.

f (u, v) =z

3. propagation and scattering in the deformed black hole

4(cid:9)h (cid:18) sinh2(hm)

sin2(h)(cid:19),

where h  (0, 1) is the deformation parameter and the dierential operator (cid:3) that appeared in
the classical case (5) has been replaced by the following nite dierence operator:

(cid:3)h = erdr(1 + er)dr  (er + 1)d2

r f (r, t) = f (r  ih, t),

t f (r, t) = f (r, t  ih).

one obviously recovers the classical counterparts in the limit h  0. what appears to be unusual
about this kind of deformation is the appearance of imaginary shifts of the arguments r, t. in
order for operators such as (cid:3)h to be dened as operators on spaces of functions of real variables
r, t one needs an unambigous prescription to extend the functions dened for real values of the
arguments to the relevant strips in the complex plane. the most natural such extension seems
to be given by requiring analyticity in the strip

s =(cid:8)(r, t)  c2;|(r)| < 2h,
f (r  2ih  i, t),

and existence of the limits
f (r  2ih, t) = lim
for almost any r, t  r. this choice can alternatively be justied by considering the reduction
from the quantized space slq(2, r).

as in the classical case one may try to construct a representation for the general solution by
means of an eigenfunction expansion for h:5 if

f (r, t) =z d()a(t)w(r)

with

hw(r) = []2

then a(t) will be determined as a solution of d2

t a(t) = []2

ha(t). the most general solution

a(t) = xmz(cid:0)amei(+im)t + bmei(+im)t(cid:1).

note that the contributions from m 6= 0 blow up for t   or t  . they correspond to
the runaway-solutions that typically cause problems for higher-derivative equations of motion.
however, in the present case one has not any problem to simply throw away the badly-behaved
solutions with n 6= 0. together with the eigenfunction decomposition of h one will thereby
obtain a perfectly well-dened initial value problem:

3.2. eigenfunction expansion for h. h will be considered as an operator dened on the
dense domain d  l2(r, d(r)), d(r) = dr(1 + er) which consists of functions that allow
extension to a function holomorphic in the strip {r  c;|(r)| < 2h} and satisfy

sup

||<2hzr

d(r) |f (r + i)|2 < .

theorem 1. the operator h is essentially self-adjoint. there exists an expansion into gen-
eralized eigenfunctions of h.

theorem 2. the following set b constitutes a basis of generalized eigenfunctions for h:

where the eigenvalue 2 is given in terms of the parameter k by the h-mass-shell relation

b =(cid:8)uh,k; k  r+(cid:9) (cid:8)vh,k; k  r+(cid:9),

and uh,k(r) is given in terms of the q-hypergeometric functions introduced in the appendix (eqn.

theorem 3. the functions uh,k(r), uh,k(r) are orthonormalized according to

zr

d(r) uh,k2(r)uh,k1(r) = 2(k2  k1),

if the normalization nh,k is chosen as

zr

nh,k =

5in this case it is technically more convenient to consider h instead of

asymptotics is normalized to one:

e+ikr(cid:19).

although these theorems are precise analogues of the corresponding statements in the unde-
formed case, their proof is quite dierent. to the authors knowledge these are the rst nontrivial
results on spectral analysis of nite dierence operators of this type.

3.3. initial value problem. the results just given allow one to write any solution as

(12)

f (r, t) =z 

0

dk(cid:16)eit(cid:0)akuh,k(r) + bkvh,k(cid:1) + eit(cid:0)ak uh,k(r) + bk vh,k(cid:1)(cid:17),

where the coecients are given in terms of the values f (r, t),
via

f (r, t)  tf (r, t) at xed time t

tf (r, t)(cid:17),
tf (r, t)(cid:17).

however, it can be shown that the expression (12) remains sensible for much more general choices
of the coecients ak, bk than those provided by (13) for solutions f (r, t). stated dierently,
general choice of ak, bk in (12) will not yield f that have the analyticity properties necessary to
be solutions in the strict sense, but only in the distributional sense.6

on the other hand one may observe that the function f (r, t) given by (12) can alternatively

be characterized as a solution of a second order dierential equation w.r.t. time of the form

(2

(14)

t + dh)f = 0,
where the kernel kh(r, r) is given by

dk 2 (cid:0)uh,k(r) uh,k(r) + vh,k(r) vh,k(r)(cid:1),

and  has to be expressed in terms of k by means of the h-mass-shell relation. the corresponding
r + v (r))(r  r). the
expression d(r, r) in the classical case is of course simply equal to (2
fact that d(r, r) is supported on the diagonal can e.g. be found by extending the k-integration
in the classical analogue of (15) to the full axis and closing the contour in the upper (lower)
half-plane depending on the sign of r  r. this will no longer be possible in the deformed case
since  as function of k has logarithmic and square-root branch cuts. dh is therefore most likely
a genuinely nonlocal operator.
to summarize: the deformed wave equation supplemented with the condition of absence of
runaway-solutions is equivalent to the nonlocal evolution equation (14), which manifestly has
a well-posed initial value problem.

6what appears to be at work is a generalization of the paley-wiener theorems relating analyticity of functions

on a strip to exponential decay properties of their fourier transforms.

3.4. scattering in region i. at this point it becomes possible to carry through a discussion
of scattering in region i of the deformed black hole in complete analogy to the undeformed case.
it basically amounts to adding subscript h at the appropriate places.

first of all it turns out that the boundary condition of vanishing on the past horizon h

again corresponds to bk  0 in (14). then one nds

it is noteworthy that one has ordinary plane waves in the asymptotic regions! this can be
understood by noting that for scales in r, t-space that are large compared to h and , k, m
small compared to h one may approximate the deformed wave equation by the undeformed one.
the asymptotic observer will see the eect of deformation only by analyzing high frequencies of
the reected waves.

finally, one may again check that information is preserved: |th,k|2 + |rh,k|2 = 1.

3.5. continuation into regions ii/iii. a remarkable qualitative dierence to the unde-
formed case shows up in considering the continuation of the wave-packet that passes through
the horizon into regions ii/iii. to this aim one should again use the u, v- coordinates. in terms
of these one has

(16)

eituh,k(r)  uh,k(u, v) = u2ifh(cid:0) 1

2 + i(  ), 1

2  i( + ), 1  2i, uv(cid:1),

which is continuously dierentiable w.r.t. v on the future horizon v = 0.7 wave packets of these
modes therefore have a well-dened continuation into region ii. as in the classical case one gets
a unique solution in region ii by demanding vanishing on the boundary between regions ii and
iv. explicitly it reads

(17)

fii (u, v) =z 

0

dk (cid:0)uh,k(u, v)th,kak + uh,k(u, v) th,kak(cid:1).

but what appears to be remarkable is the fact that the modes uh,k(u, v) are nonsingular
for any u, v > 0: the singularity has disappeared. in fact, the integral (18) that denes the q-
hypergeometric function in (16) converges absolutely for any positive as well as negative values of
uv. using the variable  = log(uv) in region ii/iii one nds that the singularity that classically

was at uv = 1 resp.  = 0 now has been resolved into a series of poles at  = i(nh + (m  1)),
n, m = 1, 2, . . . . these poles approach the real axis in the classical limit h  0 .
so what is the fate of matter fallen into the black hole in the deformed case? the further
propagation of (17) in regions ii/iii can be described in terms of the time variable  = log(u/v)
the same way as was discussed in region i. the late time asymptotics of a wave-packet that has
fallen into the black hole is then given by

4. conclusions

in the authors opinion there are three main lessons to learn from the example studied in the

present paper:

1. there are nonlocal evolution laws that may be interpreted as describing propagation of
elds on deformed geometries which allow one to avoid some of the usual problems associ-
ated with nonlocalities in a natural way.

2. this way of deformation indeed provides a resolution of singularities present in the classical
geometry, which allows one to propagate wave-packets through the region that classically
was singular. such deformations may therefore open ways to resolve the black hole infor-
mation problem.

3. there are ways to describe some kinds of small-scale fuzziness or nonlocality that do not

require non-commutativity of the underlying algebra of functions.

the example presented here is of course somewhat articial in being distinguished by its
simplicity and solvability. its main value is to illustrate the above-mentioned qualitative points
which one may expect to persist in considerably more general types of deformations.

more can be done along similar lines as presented here: first one may observe that the
present discussion already contains important ingredients for studying the quantization of solu-
tions of the deformed wave equation, with the aim of ultimately determining how the eect of
deformation shows up in the spectrum of the hawking-radiation.

furthermore, it was mentioned in the introduction that the present model is just one case of
a class of models that can be constructed and investigated along similar lines. in contrast to
the present one however, the other models are all noncommutative deformations.

of particular interest may be to study the deformation of sl(2, r)  ads3 as a model for
the possible nonlocality (e.g. [bdhm]) of string theory on backgrounds with ads3, similarly to
what was recently proposed in [jr].

finally it should be emphazized that the real task remains to nd more concrete evidence on
the small scale structure of space-time from the study of the full-edged gravitational theories
such as string theory.

5.1. q-gamma function. the basic building block for the class of special functions to be
considered is the the double gamma function introduced by barnes [ba]

h(s + ) = 2 sin(s)h(s)

where the contour is to the right of the poles at s =   n  m s =   n  m and to the
left of the poles at s = n + m s = 1 +    + n + m, n, m = 0, 1, 2, . . . .

this denition of a q-hypergeometric function is closely related to the one rst given in [nu].
