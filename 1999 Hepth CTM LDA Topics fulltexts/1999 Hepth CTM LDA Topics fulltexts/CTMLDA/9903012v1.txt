we analyse the dipole solution of heterotic string theory in four dimensions. it has the

structure of monopole and anti-monopole connected by ux line (string). due to growing

coupling near the poles, the length of the string diverges. however, exploiting the self-

duality of heterotic string theory in four dimension, we argue that this string is correctly

described in terms of dual variables.

1. introduction:

there are various solitonic objects in superstring theory. among those, most useful

are the ones that are bps saturated. bps saturated solitons preserve certain fraction of

supersymmetry. as a result, because of non-renormalisation theorems, certain quantum

numbers associated to these objects do not receive corrections as we increase the string

coupling. it is because of this key property, bps saturated solutions in string theory play

an important role in testing various duality conjectures in string theory [1]. however, in

order to shed more light on dualities, one has to come out of these bps objects. one kind

of such non-bps states have been in focus recently [2]. they are stable (even though non-

renormalisation theorems are not applicable for these states) because they are the lowest

states of certain quantum numbers. there is nothing to which they can decay.

on the other hand, in various works, the dualities of string theory have been exploited

in order to understand instabilities associated with the non-bps states. in [3] for example,

the focus was on a d6 and anti-d6 brane pair of iia string theory in ten dimension. this

is an unstable object in iia theory. when the separation between them is of the order of

string length, there is tachyonic instability. this tachyonic instability, however, was argued

to be absent in the strongly coupled version of iia theory-the m theory.

in this note, we will be interested in certain non-bps solitons in four dimensional

heterotic string theory. they are dipole like solutions somewhat similar in nature to that

of gross-perry dipole solutions [4] reduced to four dimension [5,6]. the heterotic dipole

that we will be analysing has a string like structure (may be interpreted as a ux line)

joining the two poles. however, measured in the string-frame, the length of this string

diverges. also we notice that, at the same time, the string coupling blows up near the

poles as well. in section 3, we then analyse the solution from the dual frame. heterotic

string theory , at the classical level, is conjectured to be self-dual in four dimension under

sl(2, r) transformation. thus the sl(2, r) transformed dipole will continue to be a

solution the heterotic string in four dimension. exploiting this property, we analyse the

nature of the dual-dipole. we nd, among other things, that the ux line connecting the

poles is nite in length.

2. heterotic dipole:

in this section we will discuss the dipole solution in heterotic string theory. the

heterotic string in four dimension is described by the action

s = z d4xge[rg + g   

1
12

hh   f f  ].

(1)

1

here g is the metric in the string frame.  is the dilaton, h is the anti-symmetric

tensor and f is the electromagnetic eld strength.

this action has a dipole solution as found in [5]. the eld congurations for the dipole

is given by:

ds 2 = (

 + a2sin2
r2  a2cos2
(r2  a2cos2)2

)[dt2 +

 + (m 2 + a2)sin2

+

sin2(r2  a2cos2)2

( + a2sin2)2

d2

(

dr2


+ d2)],

 = log

r2  a2cos2
 + a2sin2

a =

4am rsin2
 + a2sin2

,

 = r2  2m r  a2.

(2)

(3)

here the solution is written in the einstein-frame. the einstein-frame metric (g) is
related to the string-frame metric as g = eg .

first of all, we notice that the metric is asymptotically at. the dilaton  also goes

to a constant as r becomes large. furthermore, the asymptotic behaviour of the gauge

eld reveals the dipole nature of the solutions. the dipole moment can be read o and it

is 4am for the above eld conguration.

to have further understanding of the metric, we would now look at the region  =

0,  = 0 and  = 0,  =  as they are the possible locations of singularities. this can

be done by blowing up the coordinates near the corresponding points. for example, near

 = 0,  = 0, we dene coordinates [3]

(r0  2m )sin2 = (1  cos), 2(r  r0) = (1 + cos).

(4)
here, r0 = m + m 2 + a2 is the root of  = 0. near the region  = 0 (keeping asin2
and r  r0 nite), the eld congurations reduce to:

)1dt2 + (1 +

m
ds 2 = (1 +

m
), a = m (1  cos).


 = log(1 +

m


)(d2 + 2d2 + 2sin2 d2),

the ricci scalar can easily be calculated for the metric and is given by

r =

m 2

2( + m )3 .

2

(5)

(6)

thus, near  = 0, the metric behaves as anti-monopole in heterotic string theory. on the

other hand, we can blow up the coordinates near r = r0,  = . a similar computation as

before reveals the structure of a monopole near the region r = r0,  = .

we will now analyse the heterotic dipole in string frame. field congurations in string

frame can be read o from (2) after making the necessary metric scaling.

ds 2 = dt2 +

sin2(r2  a2cos2)2

( + a2sin2)2

d2

+

(r2  a2cos2)2

 + (m 2 + a2)sin2

(

dr2


+ d2),

e =

a =

r2  a2cos2
 + a2sin2
4am rsin2
 + a2sin2

.

from above we see that the non-zero electro-magnetic eld strength components are

fr = 

4am (r2 + a2cos2)sin2

( + a2sin2)2

, f =

4am rsin2
( + a2sin2)2

.

(7)

(8)

(9)

the metric can again be analysed near  = 0,  exactly as before in terms of coordinates
(t, , , ). near  = 0 is takes the form:

ds 2 = dt2 + (1 +

m


)2(d2 + 2d2 + 2sin2 d2),

 = log(1 +

m


), a = m (1  cos).

(10)

the curvature scalars related to the metric near  = 0, for example, are

r =

2m 2

( + m )4 , rr =

2m 2(32 + 2m + m 2)

( + m )8

.

(11)

thus we notice that near  = 0 the curvature components are nite. the heterotic string

coupling g in our case is given by e



2 . from (8) we see that for large r, the coupling g goes

to constant which has been normalised to 1 for our solution. however, as we see from (8),

when  vanishes, g diverges at  = 0, . thus the solutions given above do not make sense.

this is because, one expects, for large g, the action (1) itself would receive non-negligible

corrections. we will discuss the consequences later. we also notice that r 2

0 pgd goes

3

to zero as r  r0. this means that at r = r0, there is actually a string joining  = 0 and
 = . the metric of the string that follows from (7) is

ds2 = dt2 +

0  a2cos2)2
(r2
(m 2 + a2)sin2

d2.

one can thus calculate the length of the string as

l = z 

0 pgd =

1

m 2 + a2 z 

0

r2
0  a2cos2

sin

d.

(12)

(13)

this is clearly innity. however, we have noticed earlier that the string coupling is diver-

gent at both the ends of the string.

one can calculate the ux associated to the string by integrating a around the

coordinate  which is

 = z 2

0

ad =

8m r0

a

.

(14)

3. the sl(2, r) transformed solutions:

in the last section, we saw that the eective string connecting the monopole, anti-

monopole system diverged as a consequence of string coupling becoming strong near the

poles. what we can do however is to take the above conguration and slowly decrease the

string coupling g by sl(2, r) transformation. since, heterotic string theory is self-dual in

four-dimension, sl(2, r) transformed string-frame metric and other elds would continue

to be solution of the same theory. furthermore, since a particular choice of sl(2, r) metric

inverts the string coupling, the new coupling would be nite and small every where. we

thus rst discuss a special class of sl(2, r) transformed solution labeled by a parameter
0     (see [7] for the constructional detail ). for  = , we get the conguration
where new string coupling is the inverse of the earlier. in what follows, we rst construct

the sl(2, r) transformed solutions and then discuss their behaviour in the light of section

2.

to do this, we have to remember that the heterotic string has an anti-symmetric three

rank tensor eld h as shown explicitly in (1). for our earlier discussion, we set that

h to zero and hence it does not appear explicitly in the solutions (2)-(3). however, a

generic sl(2, r) transformation will indeed excite this eld.

4

given the solutions in (7)-(8), we can easily generate a subclass of sl(2, r) dual

solutions. in the string frame, various elds of the new solutions are given by:
sin2(r2  a2cos2)2

(r2  a2cos2)2 + 2( + a2sin2)2

ds 2 =

d2

[dt2 +

( + a2sin2)2

(1 + 2)(r2  a2cos2)2

+

(r2  a2cos2)2

 + (m 2 + a2)sin2

(

dr2


+ d2)],

the dilaton and axion elds are respectively

e

=

 =

(r2  a2cos2)2 + 2( + a2sin2)2
(1 + 2)( + a2sin2)(r2  a2cos2)
[(r2  a2cos2)2  ( + a2sin2)2]
.
(r2  a2cos2)2 + 2( + a2sin2)2

,

(15)

(16)

furthermore, the electro-magnetic eld components can be calculated from the formula

here f is dened by

f 

 =

1

1 + 2

(f +  f ).

f =

1
2

gg g f.

(17)

(18)

as it is straight forward to compute various components of f 

 using the above formula,
we do not display them here. however, we notice that for generic values of the sl(2, r)

parameter , f 

 will have electric as well as magnetic components.

in (16), we have

dened  through

ge2 = gggh.
in terms of the coordinates (t, , , ), (15) takes the form

(19)

ds 2 = 

( + m )2 + 2 2
(1 + 2)( + m )2 dt2 +

( + m )2 + 2 2

(1 + 2)2

(d2 + 2d2 + 2sin2 d2).

(20)

it is easy to check that all the curvature components associated to this metric are nite.
we also notice that the new string coupling g  = e
any , g goes to 1 for large r. secondly, for nite , at  = 0 and , g  is nite. thirdly,
for  = , g  = g1. hence, the new coupling becomes very weak at  = 0, .

has many nice features. firstly, for

at r = r0, as before, the proper length along  direction goes to zero. thus there

is still a string like structure ending at  = 0 and . this string is now described by the

metric

ds2 =

(r0

2  a2cos2)2 + 2a4sin4
(1 + 2)(r0

2  a2cos2)2
5

[dt2 +

0  a2cos2)2
(r2
(m 2 + a2)sin2

d2].

(21)

one can as before calculate the length of the string

l| =

2a2

m 2 + a2

.

(22)

in the limit m

a  0, we have from (22) l = 2a.

to conclude, we summarize what we have done in this note. in section 2, we have

analysed the heterotic dipole in four dimensions as it would be probed by a fundamental

string. we noticed that there was a string (ux line) connecting the the two poles of the

soliton. however, due to the string coupling becoming strong near the poles, the length

of the string turns out to be innite. in section 3, we then analysed the dual version of

the solution. this is constructed by exploiting the sl(2, r) self-duality property of the

heterotic string in four dimensions. in the dual description, the string coupling is well-

behaved all along the string joining the monopole, anti-monopole pair. as a consequence,

we found the length of this string to be nite.
