as shown by taubes, in the bogomolnyi-prasad-sommereld limit the su(2) yang-mills-
higgs model possesses smooth nite energy solutions, which do not satisfy the rst order bo-
gomolnyi equations. we construct numerically such a non-bogomolnyi solution, corresponding
to a monopole-antimonopole pair, and extend the construction to nite higgs potential.

i. introduction

su(2) yang-mills-higgs theory, with the higgs eld in the adjoint representation, possesses magnetic monopole
and multimonopole solutions. the solutions with unit magnetic charge are spherically symmetric [14].
in
contrast, multimonopole solutions cannot be spherically symmetric [5] and possess at most axial symmetry [69].
in particular, for magnetic charge greater than two, solutions with no rotational symmetry exist [10].

in the limit of vanishing higgs potential, the bogomolnyi-prasad-sommereld (bps) limit, monopole and mul-
timonopole solutions satisfy the rst order bogomolnyi equations [11] as well as the second order eld equations.
they have minimal energies, saturating precisely the bogomolnyi bound.

in the bps limit, monopole and axially symmetric multimonopole solutions are known exactly [3,79].

in
contrast, for nite higgs potential monopole [1,4] and axially symmetric multimonopole [12] solutions are known
only numerically. but even in the bps limit, numerical construction of axial multimonopole solutions [6] pre-
ceeded their exact construction [79], and multimonopole solutions without rotational symmetry are only known
numerically [10].

as shown by taubes [13],there is a smooth, nite action solution to the su(2) yang-mills higgs equations
in the bogomolnyi-prasad-sommereld limit, which does not satisfy the rst-order bogomolnyi equations. we
here construct numerically such a non-bogomolnyi bps solution, rst found in [14]. this solution possesses
axial symmetry and corresponds to a monopole-antimonopole pair. we extend the construction to nite higgs
potential.

we review the su(2) yang-mills-higgs model in section ii and the axially symmetric ansatz for the monopole-
antimonopole solution in section iii. we analyze the magnetic charge of the solution in section iv and present
numerical results in section v. in section vi we present the conclusions.

ii. su (2) yang-mills-higgs model

we consider the su (2) yang-mills-higgs lagrangian

 l =z (cid:26) 1

and covariant derivative of the higgs eld  = aa in the adjoint representation

f = a  a + i [a, a] ,

d =  + i [a, ] ,

(1)

(2)

(3)

and g denotes the gauge coupling constant,  the strength of the higgs potential and  the vacuum expectation
value of the higgs eld.

the lagrangian (1) is invariant under local su (2) gauge transformations g,

precisely saturate the lower bound (6).

here we construct a solution, which corresponds to a monopole-antimonopole conguration and therefore carries
q = 0. it has nite energy e > 0, and thus, in the bps limit, corresponds to a non-bogomolnyi solution of the
su (2) yang-mills-higgs eld equations.

iii. static axially symmetric q = 0 ansatz

we choose the static, axially symmetric, purely magnetic ansatz employed in [14] for the monopole-
antimonopole solution and in [15,16] for the sphaleron-antisphaleron solution of the weinberg-salam model.
here the gauge eld is parametrized by

a0 = 0 , ar =

 , a =

(1  h2)

g

, a = 

sin 

g (cid:16)h3 (2)

and the higgs eld by

the su(2) matrices  (2)

r

,  (2)



 = (cid:16)1 (2)

r + 2 (2)

 (cid:17) .

and  are dened in terms of the pauli matrices 1, 2, 3 by

 (2)
r = sin 2(cos 1 + sin 2) + cos 23 ,
 (2)
 = cos 2(cos 1 + sin 2)  sin 23 ,
 =  sin 1 + cos 2 ,

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

and for later convenience we dene

 = cos 1 + sin 2 .

we change to dimensionless coordinates and higgs eld by rescaling r  r/(g) and   , respectively.

then this ansatz leads to the eld strength tensor

fr =

2r

(h1 + 2rrh2)  ,

fr =

2r n(sin 2h1  2 sin h1(1  h4)  2 sin rrh3)  (2)

2 denotes the modulus of the higgs eld.

,

(14)

where || =p2

for nite energy congurations the modulus of the higgs eld has to be one at innity, whereas the covariant

derivatives of the higgs eld have to vanish at innity. these conditions lead to [14]

r   : 1  1 , 2  0 ,

r   : h1  0 , h2  0 , h3  sin  , 1  h4  cos  .

(15)

(16)

substituting the asymptotic expressions for the gauge eld functions into the ansatz (8) shows, that the gauge
potential approaches a pure gauge at innity

ar 
= igg ,
a 
a   sin (cos  + sin ) = igg ,

0 ,


(17)

where g = exp{i} rotates the higgs eld at innity to a constant, (cid:0)gg(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12) = 3 [17]. reexpressing the

topological charge (5) as a surface integral, we nd q = 0 for congurations obeying (15), (16), provided, the
congurations are suciently regular.

inserting the ansatz (8), (9) into the general variational equations leads to a system of six coupled non-linear
partial dierential equations for the four gauge eld functions hi and the two higgs eld functions i. the
same system of partial dierential equations is obtained by inserting the ansatz directly into the lagrangian and
calculating the variation with respect to the functions hi and i, showing that the ansatz (8), (9) is self-consistent.
the ansatz is not a priori well dened on the z-axis and at the origin. however, for solutions of the eld
equations, we have performed an expansion of the gauge and higgs eld functions near the z-axis and near the
origin [18]. inserting these expansions into the ansatz we nd that the gauge potential and the higgs eld are
well dened and (at least) twice dierentiable on the z-axis and at the origin.

at the origin we nd

(18)

where 0, gi are constants. therefore the ansatz allows for a non-vanishing higgs eld, (r = 0) = 03, at the
origin.

near the z-axis the gauge eld functions behave like

h1 = h11(r) sin  + . . . , h2 = f (r) + h22(r) sin2  + . . . ,
h3 = h31(r) sin  + . . . , h4 = f (r) + h42(r) sin2  + . . . ,

(19)

while the higgs eld functions behave like

4

1 = (r) + 12(r) sin2  + . . . , 2 = 21(r) sin  + . . . ,

(20)

where . . . indicate higher order terms in sin . at the nodes z0 of (r), the modulus of the higgs eld vanishes.
therefore, these nodes correspond to the locations of monopoles.

the euler-lagrange equations possess the discrete symmetry

z  z , h1  h1, h2  h2, h3  h3, 1  h4  (1  h4), 1  1, 2  2 .

(21)

when the solutions possess the same symmetry, we expect for each node z0 on the positive z-axis a node z0
on the negative z-axis, i. e. the monopoles come in pairs. for a solution with total magnetic charge q = 0, then
half of the monopoles carry negative magnetic charge and half of them positive magnetic charge. in the simplest
non-trivial case the solution then describes a monopole-antimonopole pair.

for such a monopole-antimonopole pair we expect a magnetic dipole eld for the asymptotic gauge potential.
deriving the asymptotic behaviour of the gauge potential, we nd that the gauge eld function h3 decays like
o(1/r) at innity, while the other gauge eld functions decay exponentionally. in particular, in the gauge where
the higgs eld is asymptotically constant [17] i. e.   3,

which leads to the asymptotic gauge potential

h3 =

representing indeed a magnetic dipole eld.

iv. magnetic charges of the q = 0 configuration

as a consequence of the vanishing topological number, q = 0, the conguration we are considering carries
zero net magnetic charge, m = 0. in the following we demonstrate, that this eld conguration still possesses
magnetic charges.

let us parameterize the higgs eld as

 = 1 + 23 ,

with

1 = sin 21 + cos 22 ,

2 = cos 21  sin 22 ,

and dene the normalized higgs eld by

 = cos  + sin 3 ,

with

1 = || cos  ,

2 = || sin  ,

(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

|| =q 2

1 + 2

2 .

1 + 2

2 =q2

thus,  maps any closed surface s in coordinate space to a 2d sphere in isospin space. we dene the degree of
the map as

(s) =

i

2v (s)zs

t rn d   d o ,

(28)

where v (s) is the volume of the surface s.

let us rst calculate the degree of the map of a 2d sphere s2 of radius r centered at the origin. we nd

 sin dd =

.

(29)

sin (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

we now anticipate that the modulus of the higgs eld possesses two zeros located at z0 and z0 on the positive
and negative z-axis, respectively. then the function  possesses discontinuities on the z-axis at z0 and z0,
i. e.  = 3/2 for  < z < z0,  = /2 for z0 < z < z0 and  = /2 for z0 < z < . for any r we nd
then (s2)(r) = 0, thus the map s2  s2 can be contracted to the trivial map.

next we consider the integral over the half sphere

note that the boundary of h 2

h 2

+ :=n(r, , ) | r xed ,   [0,

+ is a circle in the xy-plane,


2

] ,   [0, 2]o .

h 2

+ =n(r, , ) | r xed ,  =


2

,   [0, 2]o .

on the boundary the map  is constant, (r, /2, ) = 3. we now compactify h 2
identifying the boundary of h 2

+ with the south pole of s2

+. calculating the degree of the map we nd

 sin dd =

(32)

thus, the degree of the map vanishes if the location of the zero z0 is not inside the sphere s2
otherwise. an analogous calculation for the lower half sphere h 2

 leads to

+ and equals one

sin (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

let us now compare with the magnetic charges m in the upper and lower half spaces. to this end, we consider

the t hooft electromagnetic eld strength tensor

(s2

)(r) = (r  z0) .

the magnetic charge inside a closed surface s can be expressed as

m =

note, that the integration of the rst term in eq. (35) leads to the degree of the map.

for the upper half space we dene the closed surface s+ = h 2

xy-plane centered at the origin. taking into account the correct orientation of the surface element, we nd

(37)

where we have used that t r{ a} = t r{ ar} = 0, and that the rst term in eq. (35) does not contribute to
the integration over the disk d2. from symmetry considerations we know that a|=0 = 0, a|= 
= h33 and
h3(r = 0) = 0. hence we nd (see also appendix a)

analogously, for the lower half space we nd

(38)

(39)

these calculations show indeed, that the conguration possesses two magnetic charges with opposite sign,
located on the positive and negative z-axis, respectively. in general, for closed surfaces which contain only one of
the locations of the zeros of the higgs eld, integration of the eld strength tensor normal to the surface yields a
non-vanishing magnetic charge. in constrast, for a surface enclosing both charges, their contributions compensate,
yielding zero net magnetic charge.

v. numerical results

the ansatz eqs. (8), (9) is form invariant under abelian gauge transformations g = ei/2, with the gauge

to nd a unique solution we have to x the gauge and choose the condition

(40)

(41)

the set of partial dierential equations is then obtained from the lagrangian eq. (1) with the gauge xing term
g2

f added, where  is a lagrange multiplier.
this set of partial dierential equations is solved numerically subject to the following boundary conditions,
which respect nite energy and nite energy density conditions as well as regularity and symmetry requirements.
these boundary conditions are at the origin

h1(0, ) = h3(0, ) = 0 , h2(0, ) = h4(0, ) = 1 ,

sin 21(0, ) + cos 22(0, ) = 0 ,

r(cos 21(0, )  sin 22(0, )) = 0 ,

h1(r,  = 0, ) = h3(r,  = 0, ) = h2(r,  = 0, ) = h4(r,  = 0, ) = 0 ,

2(r,  = 0, ) = 1(r,  = 0, ) = 0 .

(46)

(47)

we have constructed monopole-antimonopole solutions for a large range of values of the higgs coupling con-
stant . the numerical calculations were performed with the software package cadsol/fidisol, based on
the newton-raphson method [19]. for vanishing higgs coupling constant the monopole-antimonopole solution
corresponds to a non-bogomolnyi bps solution, for which our results are in good agreement with those of
ref. [14].

in table 1 we present the normalized energy of the solutions e/4 for several values of  and compare with
the energy einf /4 of a monopole-antimonopol pair with innite separation, corresponding to twice the energy
of a charge-1 monopole. for all values of  in table 1 the energy of the monopole-antimonopole solution is less
than the energy of a monopole-antimonopole pair with innite separation.

table 1
the energy of the monopole-antimonopole solution as well as the energy of two innitely separated q = 1
monopoles, the distance d between the locations of the monopole and antimonopole, the modulus of the higgs
eld at the origin, 0, and the dimensionless dipole moment cm are given for several values of the higgs coupling
constant .

in fig. 1 we exhibit the modulus of the higgs eld |(, z)| as a function of the coordinates  =px2 + y2 and

z for  = 0 and  = 1. the zeros of |(, z)| are located on the positive and negative z-axis at z0  2.1 for
 = 0 and at z0  1.5 for  = 1. the distance d of the two zeros of the higgs eld decreases monotonically
with increasing , as seen in table 1.

asymptotically |(, z)| approaches the value one. for  > 0 the decay of the higgs eld is exponentially.
the value of the modulus of the higgs eld at the origin increases monotonically with increasing  (see table 1).
while 0 = 0.328 for  = 0, 0 is already close to one for  = 1. in the limit    we expect the modulus
of the higgs eld to be equal to one everywhere, except for two singular points on the z-axis, representing the
locations of the monopole and antimonopole. in contrast, the angle  should remain a nontrivial function in this
limit. this would then be similar to the result found in [12] for the charge-2 multimonopole.

in fig. 2 we show the energy density of the monopole-antimonopole solution as a function of the coordinates

 = px2 + y2 and z for  = 0 and  = 1. at the locations of the zeros of the higgs eld the energy density

possesses maxima. for  = 1 the maxima are more pronounced compared to the case of vanishing . at large
distances from the origin the energy density vanishes like o(r6). for intermediate distances from the origin the
shape of equal energy density surfaces looks like a dumb-bell. for smaller distances the dumb-bell splits into two
surfaces.

near the locations of the zeros of the higgs eld the equal energy density surfaces assume a shape close to a
sphere, centered at the location of the respective zero. this presents further support for the conclusion, that at
the two zeros of the higgs eld a monopole and an antimonopole are located, which can be clearly distinguished
from each other, and which together form a bound state. this is in contrast to the axially symmetric charge-2
multimonopole solution, where the individual monopoles cannot be distinguished, and where, in fact, the higgs
eld has only one (double) zero.

vi. conclusions

we have considered static axially symmetric solutions of the su (2) yang-mills-higgs model, residing in the
vacuum sector. these solutions represent monopole-antimonopole pairs. the modulus of the higgs eld possesses
zeros at the locations of the monopole and antimonopole. clearly distinguished from each other, the monopole
and antimonopole together form a bound state, which carries a magnetic dipole moment and net zero magnetic
charge. however, this bound state is unstable, corresponding to a saddle point [13,14].

we have constructed the monopole-antimonopole solutions numerically for various values of the coupling con-
stant , representing the strength of the higgs potential. with increasing , the energy e of the pair and the
ratio e/einf increase and the distance d between monopole and antimonopole as well as the magnetic dipole
moment cm decrease, while the energy density becomes more localized around the monopole and antimonopole
locations.

in the bps limit, the su (2) monopole-antimonopole solution does not satisfy the rst order bogomolnyi
equations [14]. hopefully, the numerical solution will be of help in constructing this non-bogomolnyi solution
analytically. recently also non-bogomolnyi su (n ) bps solutions, corresponding to monopole-antimonopole
congurations, have been found [20]. these solutions, however, are spherically symmetric.

vii. appendix a

at rst glance it seems to be obvious, that the second term in eq. (35) does not contribute to the surface
integral, because it is the curl of the gauge eld a = t r{ a}. however,  is not continuous on the z-axis
and introduces a singularity in the gauge eld a; its curl may contain -functions if the singularity is strong
enough.

to examine the singularity we expand the functions near the singular point ~rs = (0, 0, z0),

1 = f0 + f2 sin2  , 2 = f1 sin  ,
f0 = c0(z  z0)
1 = sin (f1 + 2f0) , 2 = f0 + sin2 (f2  2(f0 + f1))
h3 = sin h31 , 1  h4 = h40 + sin2 h42 ,

where c0, f1, f2, h31, h40 and h42 are constants. this leads to

cos  = sin 

sin  =

now we introduce spherical coordinates x = r sin  cos , y = r sin  sin , z = r cos  centered at the singular
point. with respect to these coordinates the components of the gauge eld become
