(50). fixing 2 (and hence 1+) determines ratio components stress-energy (55), certain set boundary conditions cft, xes ratio z/y eq. (47). fixing 4 sets overall scale, unknown stringy physics, determines z. however, identications z left implicit supergravity solution (50), xed 2 4, solutions exist arbitrary values z. therefore interpretation terms antiperiodic fermion boundary conditions applies set measure zero full space solutions implicitly given eq. (50). may creative boundary conditions may allow one provide cft interpretation (discrete number) solutions, seems unlikely reasonable interpretation found generic set parameters family solutions. raises question singularities singular solutions physically interesting context ads/cft correspondence. one response would singularities simply represent regions strong curvature low energy (super)gravity theory breaks down, singularity would resolved physically sensible way full theory quantum gravity (e.g., superstring- m-theory). argued ref. {$9409089$} point view correct, considering negative mass schwarzschild solution einstein equations. argument applies equally well present context negative cosmological constant. time-like singularities center negative mass black hole-ads solutions resolved within full quantum gravity theory, stable ground state would exist. hence clear certain singularities must unphysical singular solutions (or solutions regions strong curvature) physically relevant. certain special cases, singular solutions may distinguished supersymmetric, may greater merit considering singularities. remind reader solution implicitly played role section 3. background solution case ads space periodic identications horospheric coordinates. solution conical singularity null surface r = 0, horizon absence 15 identications. fact background supersymmetric would appear add weight assumption string theory able resolve singularity. ads/cft context, charged black hole solutions interesting interpretation {$9802150$}, turns corresponding supersymmetric solutions {$9711200$} actually naked (null) singularities whose role remains determined. case metric (50), singularity null singularity two preced- ing examples, solution supersymmetric. might add one evaluates supergravity action (making background subtraction ads) result nite {$9409089$}. comes metric solution supergravity equations, curvature singularity r = 0 manifest ricci scalar. divergences present curvature scalars appear higher order corrections supergravity action see, example, {$9409089$}. course, properly evaluate action including corrections, one would construct solution higher order equations motion. however, higher order terms play perturbative role (as would near singularity), one must (determine and) solve full superstring equations motion produce consistent solution. thus ads/cft correspondence seems provide another situation curvature singularities seem play interesting role string theory (see, example, {$9409089$}). given discussion point, appears remarkable case cft r3 s1 corresponds dual supergravity solution everywhere smooth. however, would like present alternative point view argues behavior exceptional. motivation arguments cosmic censorship {$9802150$}. let us begin considering ads5 spacetime horospheric coordinates, i.e., eq. (39) 4 = 0, one spatial coordinates periodically identied, say = + y. expect following conclusion supergravity independent boundary conditions supergravity fermions direction. introducing planar conguration matter spacetime sucient density, expect system collapse form black hole settles metric form eq. (24) p = 3. expectation prejudiced experience cosmic censorship black hole uniqueness theorems {$9802150$} settings. distinguishing metric component gyy spatial directions would like adding hair black hole produce singular conguration similar solutions (50). cosmic censorship dictates gravity avoid solution dynamically radiating away hair collapse leads formation black hole. thus black hole solution (24) would appear physically relevant solution independent period y! given conclusion, one would expect double analytic continutation yield supergravity solution dual cft r2 2. certainly calculations thermal ensemble s1 casimir stress-energy 2 common euclidean framework, discussed ref. {$9711200$}. one would thus conclude ads soliton (39) still relevant dual supergravity solution independent additional compactications, well boundary conditions imposed directions. hence independent period y, expectation value stress tensor would ads soliton given eq. (43). particular one 3httti = 3htxxi = 3htyyi = htzzi, independent boundary conditions imposed y-cycle. certainly result match form weak coupling result (even sin = 0) given 16 eq. (47). course, form latter result go supergravity calculation limit . inconsistency here, course. one would simply conclude various components stress tensor evolve independently hooft parameter increases zero explicit eld theory calculation large values supergravity result applies. thus eects additional identications seem erased supergravity dynamics large n limit. scenario may reasonable situation periodicity one direction much smaller others, appear problematic periodicities roughly size. analogous discussion ref. {$9802150$}, possible resolution supergravity partition function (1) includes contributions dierent ads solitons one compact directions antiperiodic fermions shrinks zero interior. given set periodicities, relative size contributions dierent supergravity solutions would determined euclidean action. case one periodicities much smaller others, corresponding ads soliton dominates partition function. periodicities roughly size, single solution would dominant. expectation htabi would presumably given weighted sum calculated individual solutions.9 thus presented two dierent pictures supergravity description dual cft torus. rst involves singular solutions, relies assumption ratios various components stress tensor preserved hooft coupling varies. evidence given support assumption observed true cft r3 s1. however, strong argument since case, form stress-energy really determined symmetries background geometry traceless property stress tensor. second scenario, supergravity dynamics erases complicated details eld theory boundary conditions produce weak coupling. picture motivated cosmic censorship black hole uniqueness which, however, well studied context ads space. another weakness arguments dynamics claimed post-collapse black hole nonsingular, pre-collapse conguration almost certainly contain singularity interior due periodic identication z. even second scenario correct, seems gravitational abhorence singularities must large n eect cft. would interesting understand physics congurations nite n claimed super-yang-mills theory resolve singularities associated gravitational collapse {$9802150$}. finally would like comment implications present results positive energy theorem ref. {$9711200$}. found singular supergravity solutions lower energy ads soliton, conjectured minimum energy solution. come surprise. one easily nd singular solutions arbitrarily negative energies, negative mass black holes. positive energy theorem least form conjectures 2 3 ref. {$9711200$} ads soliton minimum energy solution within space smooth solutions. important point considered singular solutions may physically relevant type iib 9it appears approach phase transition thermal ensemble torus high entropy black hole zero-entropy ads soliton low temperatures see refs.  discussions similar phase transitions. 17 superstring theory. case, would certainly aect conjecture 1 phrased terms full ten-dimensional type iib superstring theory. discussed though, string theory may still choose ignore singular solutions describe dual cft terms asymptotically ads geometries everywhere smooth. acknowledgements would like thank institute theoretical physics ucsb aspen center physics hospitality various stages project. research supported nserc canada, fonds fcar du quebec itp nsf grant phy94-07194. would also like acknowledge useful conversations a. chamblin, n. constable, r. emparan, g. horowitz, c.v. johnson.
