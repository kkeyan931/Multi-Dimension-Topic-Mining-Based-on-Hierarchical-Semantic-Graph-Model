abstract

the main focus of this lecture is on extended objects in adsp+2  sdp2 bosonic
backgrounds with unbroken supersymmetry. the backgrounds are argued to

be exact, special consideration are given to the non-maximal supersymmetry

case. the near horizon superspace construction is explained. the superconformal

symmetry appears in the worldvolume actions as the superisometry of the near

horizon superspace, like the superpoincare symmetry of gs superstring and bst

supermembrane in the at superspace. the issues in gauge xing of local kappa-

symmetry are reviewed.

we describe the features of the gauge-xed iib superstring in ads5  s5
background with rr 5-form. from a truncated boundary version of it we derive

an analytic n=2 o shell harmonic superspace of yang-mills theory. the reality

condition of the analytic subspace, which includes the antipodal map on the

sphere, has a simple meaning of the symmetry of the string action in the curved

space. the relevant issues of black holes and superconformal mechanics are

addressed.

during the last year there was some progress in establishing connections between ex-

act solutions of the supergravity, near horizon geometry of black holes and branes, and

quantum eld theories with (super)conformal symmetries. the connection relies on the (su-

per)isometries of the congurations which are products of anti de sitter space and a sphere,
ads  s and which also are characterized by some charge since the congurations have a
non-trivial form eld. the (super)isometries of these exact congurations form a supercon-

formal algebra. the purpose of this lecture is to discuss the set of connections between such

congurations of space-time and (super)conformal theories.

this lecture is based mostly on my recent work with p. claus, j. kumar, a. van proeyen,

a. rajaraman, j. rahmfeld, p. townsend, and a. tseytlin and on numerous discussions

with my collaborators. i will cover here some aspects of our work which relate the extended

supersymmetric objects in space-time and the worldvolume actions with superconformal

symmetry. in this lecture i rely on few other pedagogical lectures at this school where many

aspects of m-theory, string theory and ads/cft maldacenas duality [1] were explained.

the contributions to this proceedings by p. claus and p. termonia have an overlap with this

lecture and may be useful to read in this context. the topics to be covered in the lecture

are:

1. black holes and branes as solutions of supergravity equations in space-time.

2. is the supersymmetric adsp+2  sdp2 geometry conformally at?

3. exactness of adsp+2 sdp2 +form vacuum; special consideration for ads2 s2 +2-form
near horizon black hole case with smaller supersymmetry.

4. flat superspace background, its isometry and superpoincare symmetry of the extended

objects; near horizon superspace, its isometry and superconformal symmetry of the extended

objects.

5. choices of gauges for xing -symmetry.

6. iib green-schwarz superstring in ads5  s5 background with rr 5-form.

7. analytic n=2 harmonic superspace from the quantization of the truncated gs string

(superparticle) in the curved background of the ads*s boundary. the role of the antipodal

map on the sphere.

8. black holes and superconformal mechanics of a particle approaching the black hole hori-

zon.

an attempt will be made to describe the topics listed above in a relatively simple way,

mostly to explain the new concepts, referring the reader to the published papers for the

details.

1 black holes and branes as solutions of supergravity

equations in space-time.

consider various supergravity theories in d-dimensions. black holes (p = 0) and higher

branes (p > 0) are solutions of supergravity eld equations. the metric has the form

ds2

brane = h  2

p+1 dxdx + h

2

p+1 dymdym

(1)

here x are the (p + 1) coordinates along the brane, ym are the remaining (d  p  1)
coordinates of the space orthogonal to the brane, ymym  r2 and h is a harmonic function
in (d  p  1)-dimensional transverse space:

dp3

h = 1 +(cid:18)r
r (cid:19)

(2)

such metric has to be supplemented by some form-eld f  nvolume so that the congu-
ration has the maximal amount of unbroken supersymmetry. this leads to the interpretation

of this solution as a set of n parallel branes on top of each other. the number n is pro-

portional to r in some power, where r is the parameter in the harmonic function h. when

the parameter  picks up the magic value [2]

 =

p + 1

d  p  3

,

(3)

the metric given above becomes a metric with the non-singular near horizon geometry at
r = 0. the limiting metric at either very large n when r   or near the horizon at r  0

is

ds2

nearhor = (cid:18) r

r(cid:19)2

dxdx +(cid:18)r
r (cid:19)

(4)

this metric is not yet in a form of the product space adsp+2sdp2 since here the cartesian
coordinates of the d-dimensional target space are used and the split of d-dimensions into p+1
and d  p  1 is performed. to see that this metric is actually the adsp+2  sdp2 one has
to switch to spherical coordinates of the transverse space d~y2 = dr2 + r2d2, which gives

ds2

adss = ds2

ads + ds2

s = (cid:18) r

r(cid:19)2

2

dr2 + r2d2

dxdx +(cid:18)r
r (cid:19)
ads = (cid:16) r
dr2
s = r2d2. now we have a split of

(5)

r(cid:17)2
dxdx +(cid:16) r
here the rst two terms give the metric of adsp+2 space ds2
and the third term gives the metric of sdp2 sphere ds2
the original d dimensions into p + 2 and d  p  2 coordinates of the product space.

r(cid:17)2

the advantage of using cartesian coordinates is that the r-symmetry of the supercon-
formal algebra, so(d  p  1) is manifest. in this coordinate system also the action of gs
superstring in ads5  s5 background is the simplest.

the advantage of using the spherical coordinates is that the supercoset construction is

simple.

it is important to realize that what in space-time is a coordinate which labels the points

in space-time, in the worldvolume actions becomes a eld, depending on the worldvolume

coordinates. this means that the properties of coordinate system in space-time transfer into

choice of the coordinate system in the space of elds on the worldvolume which may lead to

various possibilities to develop a quantum theory.

the metric of adsp+2  sdp2 with the form f has an enhancement of unbroken super-
symmetries comparative to the full brane metric. this means that the killing spinor equation

for the supersymmetry transformation rules of gravitino (and dilatino) has a solution with

the maximal amount of the zero modes.

(g, f ) =  + f  = 0 ,

 6= 0

(6)

2 is the supersymmetric adsp+2  sdp2 geometry con-

formally at?

from questions i had during the school it become clear to me that there is a confusion with
respect to the issue of conformal atness of adsp+2  sdp2 geometries. to enhance this

3

confusion and explain its source i will bring up here the private statement of s. hawking and

g. horowitz who observed that this geometry is conformally at for all cases contrary to the

claim in [2]. the resolution of this controversy is the following. if the issue of supersymmetry
is ignored, the metric of adsp+2  sdp2 geometry can be taken in the form
dr2 + r2d2

ds2

(7)

2

adss = ds2

ads + ds2

r(cid:19)2
s = (cid:18) r

dxdx +(cid:18)r
r (cid:19)

we will show below that this metric is conformally at. however if the metric g with the

form f are required to solve the killing spinor equation (6) in addition to solving the eld

equations, the choice of the parameter  is not arbitrary and depends on d and p as shown

in eq. (3). thus for the supersymmetric solution given in the previous section only for

 =

= 1 ,

(8)

p + 1

d  p  3

we have a conformally at metric. for example, for d3 brane, d = 10, p = 3, a self-dual

string d = 6, p = 1 and for black holes, d = 4, p = 0 the conformal atness takes place even

in supersymmetric case. however, for

 =

p + 1

d  p  3 6= 1 ,

(9)

in cases like m2 brane d = 11, p = 2, m5 brane d = 11, p = 5, for black holes d = 5, p =

0, for magnetic string d = 5, p = 1 the metric of the conguration with the unbroken

supersymmetry is not conformally at!

to understand it better let us perform a change of coordinates

the metric (5) of the supersymmetric solution becomes

(cid:18)r
r (cid:19) = z

ds2

adss =

1

z2 dxdx + (r)2 dz2

z2 + r2d2

now we rescale x = rx and the metric becomes

ds2

adss =

(r)2

z2

hdxdx + dz2i + r2d2

(10)

(11)

(12)

one more step is required to combine the angles of the sphere with the radial direction z into
d p 1 coordinates zm so that d~z2 = dz2 + z2d2. this step is possible only for  = 1, the
basic reason being the fact that one can not rescale the angles of the sphere and therefore

(r)2
z2 dz2 + z2r2d2

4

(13)

in cases when  = 1 which also means that the dimension of the ads space equals the

dimension of the sphere,

we have found that the metric adsp+2  sp+2 of the supersymmetric conguration is confor-
mally at in the full target space d

p + 2 = d  p  2 ,

(14)

ds2

adsnsn =

r2

z2 hd~x2 + d~z2i

(15)

in case of ads5 s5, ads3 s3 and ads2 s2 the metric of the supersymmetric near horizon
conguration is conformally at in d=10 for d3 brane, in d=6 for the string and and in d=4

for black holes respectively.

the metric of the supersymmetric near horizon conguration ads4  s7 of the m2 brane
and of ads7  s4 of the m5 brane in d=11 (and other cases with p + 2 6= d  p  2) is not
conformally at!

having removed the confusion about the conformal atness/non-atness of the generic
supersymmetric adsp+2sdp2 solution of classical supergravity equations, we may address
another related controversial issue concerning the exactness of such congurations in the

framework of the eective action of supergravities with all higher derivative terms present.

the existing lore relates the absence of quantum corrections to conformal atness of the

metric. partially this is based on the proof presented by banks and green [3] that in d=10
iib supergravity (rabcd)4 terms do not correct the ads5s5 metric since these terms actually
depend on the weyl tensor cabcd which vanishes for the conformally at metric.

now that we have clearly shown that for m2 and m5 brane there is no conformal atness

of the supersymmetric metric, we will explain how the exactness argument works and why
in the particular case of (rabcd)4 terms in iib supergravity this more general argument is

reduced to conformal atness.

3 exactness of adsp+2  sdp2 +form vacuum
we have argued so far that adss spaces with form-elds are solutions of classical equations
of supergravities. suppose that we have an eective action of supergravity where all possible

terms with higher derivatives compatible with supersymmetries are added to the action. we

know their structure from string theory or by supersymmetry arguments. one can study the

problem how these terms will aect the classical solution [4].

5

3.1 stability of pp-waves to quantum corrections in general co-

variant theories

it is instructive to remind here the situation with the exactness of the pp-waves in gen-

eral relativity. suppose that we have some general covariant theory where the action in-

cludes higher derivative terms/quantum corrections which are general covariant. pp-wave

geometries are space-times admitting a covariantly constant null vector eld as shown by
brinkmann l = 0 , ll = 0 . for instance, for the class of d-dimensional pp-waves with
metrics of the form ds2 = 2dudv + k(u, xi)du2  dxidxi , the riemann curvature is [5]

r = 2l[(][k)l] .

(16)

the ricci tensor vanishes if k is a harmonic function in the transverse space: r =
2 (k)ll , r =  1
 1
2 ( k)ll = 0 the curvature r is therefore orthogonal to l
and to  in all its indices. since k is independent of v, the metric solves einstein equations
g = 0 if 2
t k = 0. possible corrections to eld equations may come from higher dimension

operators and depend on the curvature tensors and their covariant derivatives

g = f corr

 (r, dr, . . .)

(17)

corrections to einstein equations are quadratic or higher order in curvature tensors. note

that we do not consider the terms in the r.h.s of eq. (17) which vanish when classical eld

equation are satised. for pp-waves these terms are the ricci tensor and einstein curvature

scalar and their covariant derivatives. we construct all possible higher order terms from

the riemann curvature and the covariant derivatives of it, which do not vanish for pp-

wave solutions. this serves as an analog of the on-shell superelds which will be used in

supersymmetric theories with maximal supersymmetry.

now we may analyse all terms in (17) depending on riemann curvature and the covariant

derivatives of it. we nd that there is no way to contract two or more of riemann tensors

which will form a two-component tensor to provide the r.h.s. of the einstein equation coming

from higher dimensions operators. therefore all higher order corrections vanish for pp-waves

solutions [5]. they remain exact solutions of any higher order in derivatives general covariant

theory. this includes supergravities and string theory with all possible sigma model and

string loop corrections to the eective action, as long as these corrections respect general

covariance. note that supersymmetry played no role in establishing this non-renormalization

theorem.

6

3.2 maximal supersymmetry

the importance of having the maximal supersymmetry case when considering quantum

corrections to the supersymmetric branes and black holes is in the fact that for a given

dimensions the theory is unique, e. g. we have n=1, d=11 supergravity for m2 and m5 branes

and n=2 d=10 iib supergravity for d3 case [4]. all elds of these maximal supersymmetry

supergravities are sitting in one multiplet, which includes the graviton, there is no coupling

between dierent multiplets.

in maximally supersymmetric case of the near horizon m2, m5 and d3 branes the theories

of d=11, d=10 supergravities can be described in the so-called on-shell superspace, i.e.

in

terms of superelds which satisfy the classical equations of motion.

it is still possible to

construct in each case the manifestly supersymmetric analog of eq. (17). the right hand

side of this equation will depend on available superelds and their covariant derivatives.

the crucial part of the argument which in pp-wave case was the presence of the null killing

vector, here is the fact of the maximal unbroken supersymmetry of the relevant solutions.

from this one can derive the characteristic property of the vacua of m theory and string
theory: these vacua, ads4s7 + 4-form for the m2 brane, ads7s4 + dual 4-form for the m5
brane and ads5s5 + 5-form for the d3 brane, can be dened completely by the covariantly
constant superelds. in d=11 the basic supereld of cremmer-ferrara-brink-howe [6, 7] is

wabcd(x, ) and for the near horizon congurations this supereld is covariantly independent

[4] on x and on .

dewabcd(x, ) = dwabcd(x, ) = 0

in spherical coordinates of eq. (5) this supereld is actually x- and -independent:


x e wabcd(x, ) =





wabcd(x, ) = 0

(18)

(19)

and is given by the constant value of the form-eld of this conguration. this is a generaliza-

tion to the superspace of the xed point behavior of the elds near the horizon, established

in the usual space in [8]. in cartesian coordinates of eq. (4) the supereld is not constant

but only covariantly constant. in case of iib supergravity [9] there are two superelds in

howe-west superspace [7] of this theory, however, they are not independent as there is only

one supermultiplet in this theory. one supereld starts with the dilatino, ((x, ) and was
shown in [4] to vanish for ads5  s5 + 5-form vacuum. the second supereld, z +
abcde(x, )
is supercovariantly constant. here again in spherical coordinates of eq. (5) this supereld is

7

actually x- and -independent


x e z +

abcde(x, ) =





z +

abcde(x, ) = 0 .

(20)

and equal to the constant value of the rr 5-form.

thus the correction to classical equations of motion which do not vanish on classical so-

lutions which we discuss here may depend only on non-dierentiated value of the superelds.

to show that such contributions are absent, one has to observe that the bosonic equations of

motion are given by some derivatives of the fermionic equations of motion since they come

out as some higher components of the fermionic equations. the generic form of corrections

to the fermionic equations inevitably has to carry a fermionic index. in our bosonic vacuum

such index may come only from a fermionic derivatives on the superelds dened above.

however such derivatives on the superelds of our vacua vanish. this accomplishes the

chain of arguments about the exactness of the supersymmetric vacua of m-theory and string

theory.

the ads  s vacua form a xed point in the superspace, where the rst derivatives on the
superelds vanishes and the superelds take a xed, non-vanishing value. in the string case

it is a value of the rr 5-form, in m-theory it is the value of the 4-form and its dual. note

that for the trivial vacua, the at superspace, all these superelds wabcd(x, ), ((x, )
and z +

abcde(x, ) vanish everywhere. for generic supergravity they are functions of (x, ).
the brane solutions interpolate [11] between these two types of exact vacua, at superspace

and near horizon superspace, to be described below.

3.3 ads2  s2 +2-form near horizon black hole case with smaller

supersymmetry

in case of smaller, non-maximal supersymmetry in a given dimension, the theory is not

completely dened by dimension and the properties of the supergravity multiplet, including

the graviton. therefore the theories with non-maximal supersymmetry are not unique even

before higher derivative terms are taken into account. for example, in d=4 n=2 supergrav-

ity there is a supergravity multiplet, which includes the graviton, and the matter multiplets

without a graviton. these are vector multiplets, including gauge elds and hypermultiplets.

such theories require the information on the prepotential, a function which denes the cou-

pling of the theory. the choice of such function is not unique and we will see below to which

extent this aects the issue of exactness.

8

in [4] we looked at d=4 n=2 supergravity without vector or hypermultiplets (pure su-

pergravity), as a toy model for d=11,10 theories with one multiplet. in such case there is

only one vector eld in the theory, belonging to the supergravity multiplet, no scalars, only

one charge q = z = m and we have classically the reissner-nordstrom black hole. near
the horizon the metric tends to the bertotti-robinson ads2  s2 and there is a covariantly
constant 2-form. the only supereld of this theory, wab was shown in [12] to be covariantly

constant due to enhancement of supersymmetry near the horizon. the argument about the

absence of quantum corrections to supersymmetric bertotti-robinson conguration in pure

d=4 n=2 supergravity was based on this xed point behavior of the supergravity supereld


x e w ij

ab(x, ) =





w ij

ab(x, ) = 0 .

(21)

as in cases above.

quite recently some new results on the stability2 of the ads2  s2 geometry with the
2-forms in presence of vector multiplets and r2
abcd corrections were obtained [13]. one starts
with the supergravity coupled to abelian vector multiplets, x i are the scalar elds of the
vector multiplets, and some chiral background eld a. the coupling is encoded into a
holomorphic function f (x i, a) which is homogeneous of degree two.
lowest components of the reduced chiral multiplet w ij
tensor t ij
allows to generate the curvature square terms r2

ab related to weyl multiplet is the
ab. the background chiral multiplet a is identied with w 2 at some point. this
abcd in the action in a supersymmetric way.
in fact, one starts with the lagrangian which has a superconformal symmetry, so that the

in this theory the

action is of the form

where

16l = ekr + . . .

ek = ih x ifi(x, a)  fi( x,

a)x ii

(22)

(23)

if not for the dependence of the prepotential on the chiral eld a, this would be a kahler

potential of the special geometry. the dots in the lagrangian are for the action of the vector

2the main purpose of [13] was to nd the corrections to the black hole entropy in presence of r2 terms.
these corrections are due to walds redenition of the black hole entropy in presence of r2 terms and
corrections to the prepotential which takes care of the second chern class of the calabi-yau threefold.
with these modications the supergravity corrections to the entropy are found to be in agreement with
microscopic calculations of the entropy by maldacena, strominger, witten and vafa [14]. an important step
in establishing this result in [13] was the derivation of the ads2  s 2 solution in presence of r2 terms in the
action.

9

multiplets and couplings to the chiral multiplet a. the central charge is dened as in the

usual case of special geometry, however, the prepotential and all functions of it carry the
additional dependence on a (on r2

abcd)

z = ek/2(pifi  qi x i)

(24)

the superconformal symmetry of the action (22) has been xed by the choice of the gauge

ek = ih x ifi(x, a)  fi( x,

a)x ii = 1

(25)

note that the presence of r2

abcd terms does aect the choice of the gauge. in this gauge we

have a usual supergravity theory with supersymmetry, without conformal symmetry.

the equations of motion of this theory with higher derivative terms included have been
solved with the ansatz of ads2  s2 geometry with the 2-forms. it was also found that this
solution has an unbroken n=2 d=4 supersymmetry with xed point behavior. thus the
solution is found where x i, fi, a, t ij

ab are xed constants. the metric is

ds2 = ds2

ads + ds2

s = 

r2

|z|2 dt2 + |z|2

r2 dr2 + |z|2d2

(26)

where the central charge dening the size of the ads throat and the radius of the sphere is

related to the 2-form as follows

t ij
01 = 2ijz 1

here the central charge in the chosen gauge at the xed point is given by

z = (pifi(xf ix, af ix)  qix i

f ix)

(27)

(28)

thus one can conclude that for this particular theory of n=2, d=4 supergravity with vector
multiplets and r2 terms the ads2  s2 geometry with the 2-forms dening the size of the
radius is a solution.

3.4 comment on exactness versus conformal atness

in the generic case of m-theory as well as in string theory vacua we have not used the

conformal atness of the metric to prove the stability of the classical solution.

in fact,

near horizon metric of supersymmetric m2 and m5 branes is strictly not conformally at,
as  = p+1
conformally at. moreover, the argument in [3] about r4

dp3 is equal to 1/2 and 2, respectively. still in d3 case  = 1 and the metric is
abcd terms not aecting the ads5s5

10

conguration is based completely on conformal atness of the near horizon geometry of the

d3 brane. the resolution of this puzzle is the following.

the maximal amount of 32 unbroken supersymmetries is valid in m-theory as well as in

string theory. the integrability condition of eq. (6) in both cases reads

 [ab] = [a b] = 0

(29)

when translated into the supereld language this allows to prove that some higher in 
component of the supereld wabcd in m-theory or z +
abcde in string theory, vanishes. in m-
theory we get for the 2 component of the supereld wabcd (see [6] for details) the following

the important dierence with the m-theory case is that the combination of curvature and

forms in eq. (34) on shell forms exactly the weyl tensor! the bilinear combination of forms

provides the dierence between the riemann tensor and weyl tensor. weyl tensor vanishes
for ads5  s5 supersymmetric solution and this is a particular form of the proof of the fact
that the supereld z +
abcde is -independent. this particular form of the argument does not
work in m-theory, however the fact that a combination of curvature and forms vanishes still

works! thus the unbroken supersymmetry which in all cases provides the -independence

of the supereld is the fundamental reason for exactness. in string case this manifests itself

via conformal atness.

supermebrane are known in the generic background of supergravity. the coordinates z =

(x, ) of the target (super)-space become functions of the world-volume coordinates of the
brane 

z () = (x(), ())

(36)

the worldvolume lagrangians depend on the pullback of the geometric objects, vielbeins

and forms, in the target superspace to the worldvolume

 = z e

(z), a0...p = 0z 0 . . . pz pa0...p(z)]

(37)

l[e

thus if we know the supervielbein form

e

(z)

12

and the p + 1 form

a0...p(z)

in the superspace for any supergravity theory, one can use this information to construct the

worldvolume actions in any background.

consider rst the at superspace. there are no form elds,

a0...p(z) = 0

the supervielbein forms are simple

e = d

ea = dxa  ad

the isometries of the at superspace

 = 

xa = a

(38)

(39)

(40)

form the super-poincare algebra. this is the reason why the gs superstring and bst-

supermebrane are manifestly supersymmetric. for example, gs classical superstring action
depends on the pullback to the world-sheet with coordinates  of the manifestly supersym-

metric vielbein forms of the at target superspace:

e
  

 = xa  a
ea

under the superspace isometries these objects are invariant

isome

 = 0

(41)

(42)

and therefore the choice of the background provides the global symmetry of the gs and bst

actions.

one would like to construct the string and the m2 and m5 and dp brane actions not

only in the at superspace but also in the background of the supersymmetric branes. the

most interesting case would be the iib string interaction with rr 5-form of the d3 brane.

to construct the supersymmetric worldvolume actions in any background other than

the at superspace some time ago was looking like an impossible task. the point is that

the vielbeins of m-theory and iib string theory depend on 32 fermionic coordinates  and

therefore they look like

e(x, )

 = (e0(x))

 + (e1(x))

 + . . . + (32e32(x))



13

for any particular background one would be able to nd such long supereld depending on

32 fermionic coordinates  but one may not expect to get any closed form of it, in general.

a beautiful exception from this rule is the superspace generalization of the the near horizon

bosonic background of m2, m5 and d3 branes (and other cases in the table 1), suggested

in [15]. the supercoset construction was developed for the iib superstring and d3 brane in

[16] and with the use of the closed form of the near horizon superspace [15] these actions
have been presented in the supersymmetric ads55 with rr form background in a closed
form.

one may either use the supercoset construction g/h or equivalently, use the supergravity
theory 3 to nd the near horizon superspace which at  = 0 is a bosonic near horizon m2,

m5, d3 brane, etc. one starts with the superalgebra g, which for each case is shown in

the table 1. the supercoset construction g/h consists of solving the set of maurer-cartan

equations

where

d2 = 0

d  d + laba + lf

(43)

(44)

here b and f are bosonic and fermionic generators of the superconformal algebra g. the

solution of mc equations for fermionic 1-forms takes the following form : there is a term linear

in  and higher order corrections enter via a multiple commutators of fermionic generators:

fl = fd + [f[f, fd] +   

(45)

here the fermionic generator f consists of supersymmetry q and special supersymmetry s
and d is the value of the operator d at  = 0 and la
the solution for cartan forms can be written in a closed form as

0 is the bosonic cartan form at  = 0.

the superisometries of this background have been found recently in a closed form in [17]

and they are given by the transformations of near horizon superspace coordinates z

adssz = adssz(z)

(48)

and the compensating stability h-group transformations. these isometries form a super-

conformal algebra. therefore the actions of the extended objects in this background have a
(z) of the space-
superconformal symmetry since the pullback to the worldvolume z e

time forms are invariant under the isometries.

the m2 supermebrane classical action in ads4  s7 and ads7  s4 backgrounds of the
near horizon m2 and m5 branes has been constructed in the near horizon superspace in [18].

5 issues in gauge-xing of -symmetry

the supersymmetric actions of extended objects have local worldvolume -symmetry in

generic background. therefore 1/2 of the 32-component spinor  are unphysical and one

have to get rid of them. the standard procedure consists of gauge-xing of this symmetry,

by choosing an algebraic constraint on  with non-propagating ghosts (if the constraint

includes the worldvolume derivatives, one has to consider the ghosts action since in this case

the ghost are propagating elds). in the near horizon superspace one can consider at least

3 possibilities.

 light-cone gauge, + = 0 or  = 0.

the rst possibility is to consider the same gauge which has been used for the quan-
tization of the gs superstring in the at superspace [19]. this gauge requires the p +

components of the momenta to be non-vanishing since the kinetic term for the remain-
ing fermions looks as p + and one has to be able to divide on p +. this works
well even for massless states for which p +p  + (p i)2 = 0. the problem in the near

horizon space is that in the light-cone gauge the values of the vielbein forms do not
seem to simplify and each of these superelds still goes all the way till 16. this may

not necessarily be a major problem, but still one may try to do dierent things. note
that by choosing  = 0 gauge we would not change anything in proper notation, it

is an equivalent gauge.

15

 q, s class of gauges for the near horizon background 4 . in the context of the super-

conformal algebra there is a natural split of the fermions into

f = (cid:18) q+1/2
s1/2 (cid:19)

(49)

where the supersymmetry generator q has a conformal weight +1/2 and the special
supersymmetry generator s has a conformal weight 1/2. the coordinates also can
be split in analogous way:

f  = qq + ss

(50)

let us now consider these two inequivalent possibilities. the basic reason why these

two gauges are inequivalent is due to the triangular nature of the supervielbein in the

killing spinor gauge in the superspace. in these class of gauges  are considered to be
the functions of x of the form (x) = k(x), or in split form:
(x)(cid:19)(cid:18) +
(cid:19)

(cid:18) q(x)
s(x)(cid:19) = (cid:18)kq

+(x) kq

and  are x-independent coordinates. in such case one can show [15] that

d = k(x)d

(52)

 q-gauge,  = 0, [20].

this gauge gives the remarkable simplication of superspace vielbeins. note that in

this gauge

at n = 1, 2, . . .

4in [20] we called these gauges killing (anti-killing) spinor gauge for xing -symmetry, since the killing
spinors play an important role here. on the other hand there is a choice of the gauge in the superspace which
was also given a name of a killing spinor gauge versus wess-zumino gauge [15]. in killing spinor gauge in
superspace the spinor-spinor component of the vielbein at vanishing  is taken from the the killing spinors
of the bosonic space [21]. to avoid misunderstanding we will refer to the relevant gauge in the superspace
as to killing spinor gauge and to the gauges for xing -symmetry, as to q or s gauge.

16

the vielbein forms are reduced to the following expressions

lq = (d)q ,

ls = 0 ,

la = la

0 + 2

qf a

(d)
q ,

(57)

i.e. the vielbeins are quadratic in q at most, like in the at superspace. therefore the

actions in the q-gauge are no more complicated than those in the at superspace, what

concerns the fermions. one has to specify the conditions when such gauge is admissible
and we will give examples of this for the gs string in ads5  s5 in [23, 24]. in case
we consider the action for the extended object in its own near horizon background,
e.g. the d3 brane in ads5  s5, a special requirement has to be imposed to make the
q-gauge admissible. this requirement is that the momenta in directions transverse to

the brane are not vanishing.

 s-gauge, q = 0.

this constraints on spinors was considered in detail in [22] with respect to quantization

of the d3 brane. using our set up we can show that at q = 0

m2n = 0 at n = 1, 2, . . .
m2d 6= 0 , m2nd = 0 ,

at n = 2, 3,  

(58)

(59)

thus in this gauge the fermionic vielbeins have terms 3 and the bosonic ones have
up to 4. the advantage of this gauge that one can consider the actions of the ex-

tended objects in its own near horizon background without requiring the non-vanishing

momenta in transverse directions to the brane.

in conclusion, the xing of -symmetry in supersymmetric ads  s backgrounds has been
studied in q-gauge, s-gauge and light-cone gauge. the vielbeins depend on up to 2, 4
and 16, in these gauges, respectively.

an alternative procedure is available for ads  s spaces, it was called in [25, 26, 22] an
it is based on the supersolvable subalgebra of the superconformal

6 iib green-schwarz superstring in ads5  s5 and rr-

maldacenas conjecture about the duality between the iib superstring in ads5  s5 and
rr-form and n=4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory is based on the fact that both theories

17

have the same symmetry forming the su(2, 2|4) superalgebra.

the classical superstring action in this background was constructed recently [16, 15] in

the background whose coordinates z = (x, ) form an

the dirac matrices are split in the 5+5 way, a = a  1  1, a = 1  a  2, where
k are pauli matrices (see [16] for details on notation). this classical action has two type of

symmetries.

 global su(2, 2|4) symmetries.

the global symmetries are the near horizon superspace isometries found in [17] which
form the su(2, 2|4) superalgebra. as explained above, these symmetries act on the
coordinates of the superspace: adssz. the isometries are functions of z and of the
global parameters of the su(2, 2|4) superalgebra. under these transformations the
classical string action is invariant. one may expect the spectrum of states to have the
superconformal symmetry su(2, 2|4).

 local symmetries

the action is invariant under local symmetries, reparametrization and -symmetry,

whose parameters depend on the worldsheet coordinates . the action in (60) is a

particular example of the iib superstring action in a generic background of supergravity

[27] where the local symmetries symmetries are given. these local symmetries have to

be gauge-xed.

18

the important property of -symmetry in the curved background of supergravity is

that the background has to be on shell. this means in particular that any brane action

known in generic iib supergravity superspace can be coupled consistently to the near

horizon superspace of the d3 brane. for example, one can couple the gs iib string,
d1, d3 and d5 brane to ads5  s5 superspace with rr form.

by gauge-xing -symmetry one can reduce the number of fermions by 1/2 to match

the number of physical bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. the gauge-xing of -

symmetry was performed in [23] developing the proposal [20] and the action was found which
has terms at most quartic in fermions.5 the special -symmetry gauge using the projector

parallel to d3-brane directions allowed to substantially reduce the power of fermionic terms

in the action.

let us review the -symmetry gauge xing of this action performed in [23]. we shall use
the d3-brane adapted or 4+6 bosonic coordinates x m = (xp, yt) in which the ads5  s5
metric is split into the parts parallel and transverse to the d3-brane directions (we take the

radius parameter to be r = 1)

5a similar action was found in [26] using supersolvable (ssolv) algebra approach [25]. in [23] and [26]
dierent choices of bosonic (and fermionic) coordinates were used: cartesian and horospherical in [23] and
projective coordinates on s 5 in [26]. a change of variables has been found in [28] which brings both actions
to the same form.

if we further transform from the coordinates (y, a) to the 6-d cartesian coordinates yt in
(64), yt = y1+2 (1, a), that would eectively absorb the matrix  into an so(6) spinor
rotation. in the cartesian coordinates yt = y yt the 6-d part of the covariant derivative has
the form dij
2ij t(dyt + ytd log y). this simplication is suggested
by the form of the killing spinors in ads5  s5 space viewed as the near-horizon d3-brane

(70)

the xx terms representing the coupling to the rr background present in the original
action [16] in eq. (60) are now hidden in the x terms because of the redenition made

in (68). we may also put the action in the rst-order form by introducing the momenta

in order to achieve an understanding of the -symmetry gauge choice in (65) it is useful

to study the issue of invertibility of the fermionic kinetic operator in the actions (70),(71).

in particular, we shall consider the at space case obtained by omitting (or just treating as
constant) the y2 and 1/y2 factors in the action (72). in general, the constraints coming from

the equation of motion for the 2-d metric can be written in terms of the vielbein components

before -symmetry gauge xing the quadratic fermionic terms in the at-space gs action

are

2(  )zz2  2a22 .
on the classical equations and constraints we get (a1)2 = (a2)2 = 0, i.e.

1(  )zz1  1a11 ,

(74)

the fermionic

operator is degenerate for any classical string background. as we shall see below, after the

-symmetry gauge xing as in (65) the degeneracy is removed provided the background is

constrained in a certain way. in case of the gauge-xed action (70) the background has to

be a bps one so that the gauge is admissible. let us look at this in more details.

the quadratic term in the fermionic part of the gauge-xed action (70) is (we omit the

fermionic terms in )

 y [(  )zz + (  )zz]    a  ,

where we introduced the notation

to conclude, we have shown that choosing the d3-brane or 4-d space-time adapted
-symmetry gauge in the ads5  s5 superstring action one obtains an action in which the
fermionic term is quartic. the 4+6 cartesian parametrization of the 10-d space leads to a

substantial simplication of the fermionic sector of the theory. this should hopefully allow
one to make progress towards extracting more non-trivial information about the ads5  s5
string theory and thus about its dual [1]  n = 4 super yang-mills theory.

7 superparticle at the boundary of ads5  s5 ; ana-

lytic harmonic superspace of n=2 super yang-mills
theory

the string action on ads5  s5 is not quadratic and therefore as dierent from the at
in curved
superspace background it is not clear how to construct the quantum theory.

background one can not have expected to nd a simple quadratic action. however one may

try to nd some suitable variables in which the theory will become more useful. we will try

to make the fermionic action quadratic in a way relevant to super-yang-mills theory. we also

would like to use some guide from the yang-mills theory. this guide is an analytic harmonic
superspace6 where the n=2 d=4 yang-mills theory can be formulated o-shell [30].

as an example of such a possibility we will consider here a particular approximation to
the full iib string theory on ads5  s5 , starting with the gauge-xed string action in the
form (72). the approximation consists of

 boundary limit |y|  
6recently the limit to the boundary of the ads5  s 5 superspace was used in [29] to derive the n=2
harmonic superspace. here we perform a closely related study where we in addition derive the analytic
subspace and get the fermionic action quadratic.

22

to take this limit we rewrite the action in spherical coordinates on s5 which include
the radius of the sphere, |y| and 5 angles 1, . . . , 5. only the angular part of the
action (iy/y)2 given by imingmn() survives at the boundary.

the wz term in the form when the derivative hit the fermions has a term proportional
to the |y|. to provide the existence of the limit is sucient to require that  depend
only on  and do not depend on . this suggests also the next approximation:

 dimensional reduction of the gauge-xed string action.

here we extend the independence of fermionic variables from one of the world sheet

directions, suggested by the boundary limit, to other elds, coordinates of the 4-

dimensional boundary of ads5, and angles of the sphere.

the toy model action is a gauge-xed dimensionally reduced to one dimension string

action in the limit to the boundary of ads5  s5 .
it is plausible that one can get this
action by considering a superparticle in ads5  s5 background and gauge xing the local
symmetries of the superparticle action and taking the limit to the boundary. the action is

the part of the action coming from the s5 part of the geometry is written here in terms
of the independent variables, angles of the s5. alternatively one can use from the beginning

the total action (80)

stoy = z d (cid:20) pp(xp + iip i  iip i) + lsphere[u()] + sghosts(b, c)(cid:21)

(83)

has superconformal symmetry which follows from the isometry of the background and is

non-linearly realized after the gauge-xing. the global q-supersymmetry of this action is

manifest. it is given by the following transformations

i = i
 i
 = i

xp = i(ip i  ipi)
u() = 0

(84)

these are precisely the n=4 supersymmetry transformations of global supersymmetry in the

central basis [30]. the fermionic part of the action is cubic in elds and the action depends

on the 16-component spinor.

we would like to make the fermionic part of this action quadratic in elds. it is instructive

to truncate the action to n=2 supersymmetric one. for this we have to take

3 = 4 = 0

3 = 4 = 5 = 0

(85)

thus we cut s5 down to s2 and keep only 1/2 of the fermions. the action of the sphere

variables can be written in two possible ways: either in terms of the angles on the sphere or

in terms of spherical harmonics.

ss 2 =

central basis which consists of (cid:18)z m , u

i ()(cid:19) where z m = (xp, i, i

).

24

the supersymmetries are shown above. there are two possibilities to formulate the

reality condition of this action which precisely t the known two possibilities to formulate

the reality condition of harmonic superspace.

1. standard hermitean conjugation. pp and xp and angles on the sphere 1 and 2 are

real and the chiral spinors i and i

 are conjugate of each other.

p p = pp ,

xp = xp , 1,2 = 1,2 ,

i = i


(89)

the action is hermitean conjugate, s = s.

2. hermitean conjugation+antipodal map on the sphere. in the central basis this second
reality condition is the symmetry of the action and it means that as before that pp and xp
are real, the chiral spinors i and i
 are conjugate of each other. the new feature is the
antipodal map on s2 which means that each point on the sphere is projected to the antipodal

one by the following shift of the angles:



1=   1


2=  + 2

(90)

in particular the north pole of the sphere become a south pole under the antipodal map.

the other variables are neutral under the antipodal map and therefore for them we have, as

before


p p= pp ,


xp= xp ,



i= i



(91)

the action is hermitean+antipodal map conjugate,


s= s.

it is of particular importance that it is the second reality condition under hermitean+

antipodal map conjugation that is the property of the unconstrained analytic superelds in

n=2 analytic superspace. this is quite dierent from the usual chiral superspace of n=1

supersymmetry where the chiral superelds in the chiral basis are complex.

now that we have found this reality condition under hermitean+antipodal map conjuga-

tion to be a symmetry of the toy model string action (88), we may ask if the knowledge of

the analytic superspace describing the yang-mills theory can help us to make the fermionic

part of the action quadratic in elds. the answer is positive. as suggested by variables in
a, +, +, , ), we have to perform the

a = (xp

a , u

the analytic basis [30] (cid:18)z m

i (cid:19) where z m

following change of the variables in our action:

i

  ui+

(92)

and

the action becomes

a = xp  2i(ip j)u+

sanal = z d (cid:20)pp(xp

a + 2i+p  + 2ip +) + l(1, 2, ) + sghosts(cid:21)

(93)

(94)

the terms in l(, ) in addition to the action depending only on angles of the sphere has now

also some terms with derivatives on angles which depend on fermions . we will focus here

on the rst part of the action which has derivatives on fermions. the nice thing happened:
the derivatives hit only +, + and not , . we may introduce the new variables now:

 = 2ippp ,

 = 2ippp 

(95)

the part of the action which comes from the boundary of ads after truncation becomes a free
quadratic action which depends only on + and + and their canonical conjugate variables,
which are related to  and .

sads

anal = z d (cid:20)ppxp

a + +  +  +(cid:21)

(96)

our action is still supersymmetric but the supersymmetry is realized on the smaller set of co-
a, +, +).
the o-shell yang-mills theory is described by the analytic superelds which in the analytic

ordinates related to the analytic subspace which includes (cid:18) m , u

i (cid:19) where  m = (xp

basis depend only on the coordinates of the subspace. the analytic subspace is real under

hermitean+ antipodal map conjugation. our action in the analytic basis inherits the reality

condition which includes the antipodal map on the sphere from the original action in the

central basis.

as a nal remark in this section we would like to stress that the action of the superparticle
on ads5  s5 space upon truncation to n=2 supersymmetric part oers new possibilities
to link the string theory with yang-mills theory via analytic subspace of the harmonic

superspace. one can hope to develop the analogous methods for the untruncated string

theory and simplify the structure of the theory.

8 black holes and conformal mechanics

this section is based on recent work in [32, 33, 34]. one of the deep issues in black hole

physics is the existence of the horizon which prevents the standard quantum mechanical

26

treatment of this system. on the other hand there is an issue in the conformal mechanics

model of [35] known as the absence of the ground state with e = 0. the hamiltonian of

[35] is

h =

p2
2m

+

g
2x2 .

(97)

in the black hole interpretation of the model, the classical analog of an eigenstate of h is

an orbit of a timelike killing vector eld k, equal to /t in the region outside the horizon,
and the energy is then the value of k2. the absence of a ground state of h at e = 0 can
now be interpreted as due to the fact that the orbit of k with k2 = 0 is a null geodesic

generator of the event horizon, which is not covered by the static coordinates adapted to

t. the procedure used in [35] to cure this problem was to choose a dierent combination

of conserved charges as the hamiltonian. this corresponds to a dierent choice of time, one

for which the worldlines of static particles pass through the black hole horizon instead of

remaining in the exterior spacetime.

therefore one can believe that the study of conformal quantum mechanics has potential

applications to the quantum mechanics of black holes. as one can see from the table 1. in

sec. 3, the near horizon geometry of the supersymmetric d=4 black holes with electric and/or
magnetic charge, is the simplest example of adsp+2  sd42 with the 2-form conguration
with p = 0, d = 4 relevant for the superconformal symmetry of the particle mechanics.

a surprising connection between black holes and superconformal mechanics models of

akulov and pashnev and of fubini and rabinovici [36] was found in [32]. the main new

observation is that one recovers the supersymmetric conformal mechanics of [36] in the
limit of the large black hole mass m   but one also nds a generalization of these
superconformal models for the black holes with the arbitrary mass m.

we start from the extreme rn metric in isotropic coordinates

ds2 =  1 +

m

 !2

dt2 + 1 +

m

 !2

[d2 + 2d2] ,

(98)

where d2 = d2 + sin2  d2 is the so(3)-invariant metric on s2, and m is the black hole

mass, in units for which g = 1. the near-horizon geometry is therefore

m(cid:19)2
ds2 = (cid:18) 

 !2
dt2 +  m

d2 + m 2d2 ,

(99)

which is the bertotti-robinson (br) metric. it can be characterized as the so(1, 2) so(3)
invariant conformally-at metric on ads2  s2. the parameter m may now be interpreted

27

as the s2 radius (which is also proportional to the radius of curvature of the ads2 factor).

a test particle in this near-horizon geometry provides a model of conformal mechanics in

which the so(1, 2) isometry of the background spacetime is realized as a one-dimensional

conformal symmetry. if the particles mass m equals the absolute value of its charge q then

this is just the p = 0 case of the construction of [2].

in horospherical coordinates (t,  = /m) for ads2, the 4-metric and maxwell 1-form of

the br solution of maxwell-einstein theory are

ds2 = 2dt2 +
a = dt .

m 2
2 d2 + m 2d2 ,

(100)

the metric is singular at  = 0, but this is just a coordinate singularity and  = 0 is actually

a non-singular degenerate killing horizon of the timelike killing vector eld /t. we now

dene a new radial coordinate r by

the br metric is then

 = (2m/r)2 .

ds2 = (2m/r)4dt2 + (2m/r)2dr2 + m 2d2 .

(101)

(102)

note that the killing horizon in these coordinates is now at r = .

the (static-gauge) hamiltonian of a particle of mass m and charge q in this background

is h = p0 where p0 solves the mass-shell constraint (p  qa)2 + m2 = 0. this yields

h = (2m/r)2[qm2 + (r2p2

r + 4l2)/4m 2  q] ,

(103)

where l2 = p2

 + sin2  p2

, which becomes minus the laplacian upon quantization (with

eigenvalues ( + 1) for integer ). we can rewrite this hamiltonian as

where

and

h =

p2
r
2f

+

mg
2r2f

,

f =

1
2

[qm2 + (r2p2

r + 4l2)/4m 2 + q] ,

g = 4m 2(m2  q2)/m + 4l2/m .

28

(104)

(105)

(106)

this hamiltonian denes a new model of conformal mechanics [32]. the full set of generators

of the conformal group are

h =

1
2f

p2
r +

g

2r2f

, k = 

1
2

f r2 , d =

1
2

rpr ,

(107)

where k generates conformal boosts and d generates dilatations. it may be veried that

the poisson brackets of these generators close to the algebra of sl(2, r).

to make contact with previous work on this subject, we restrict to angular quantum

number  and consider the limit

m   ,

(m  q)  0 ,

with m 2(m  q) kept xed. in this limit f  m, so
g
2r2 ,

p2
r
2m

h =

+

with

g = 8m 2(m  q) + 4( + 1)/m .

(108)

(109)

(110)

this is the conformal mechanics of [35]. for obvious reasons we shall refer to this as non-

relativistic conformal mechanics; the non-relativistic limit can be thought of as a limit

of large black hole mass. when  = 0 an ultra-extreme m < q particle corresponds to
negative g and the particle falls to r = 0, i.e. it is repelled to  = . on the other hand,
a sub-extreme m > q particle is pushed to r = , which corresponds to it falling through
the black hole horizon at  = 0. the force vanishes (again when  = 0) for an extreme

m = q particle, this being a reection of the exact cancellation of gravitational attraction

and electrostatic repulsion in this case. a static extreme particle of zero angular momentum

follows an orbit of /t, and remains outside the black hole horizon.

a discussion of supersymmetric versions of the conformal mechanics related to black

holes can be found in [32, 33, 34] and this eld will require more studies. for example

the superconformal mechanics of the particle approaching the black hole horizon which is
expected to have a full su(1, 1|2) superconformal algebra, has not been constructed so far
but it will be constructed in the near future.

an interesting aspect of the relation between black holes and integrable calogero models

has been studied in [34]. the model has the hamiltonian

h = xi

p2
i
2m

+xi<j

2

(qi  qj)2 .

29

(111)

the case of 2-particle calogero model was considered in detail. it has been found that to

have an agreement with the black hole hamiltonian (in case of large black hole mass) one

has to nd a way to constrain the particle orbital angular momentum to even integers so

that from calogero model the relevant coupling constant equals 4l(l + 1) as in (110) at
m = q = 1. this can be achieved by requiring the identication of the antipodal points8 on
s2 and opens the possibility to consider calogero models with q = q1  q2 both positive and
negative, which may give some insights about the exterior and also interior of the black hole

horizon.

it would be very interesting to understand the quantum mechanical features of the new

conformal and superconformal models in [32] before the limit to the large black hole mass
is taken. in this limit the curvature of the ads2  s2 space vanishes and one may loose the
important properties of the curved space. however when the mass of the black hole is not

very large, we may nd interesting quantum mechanical properties starting from the classical

superconformal mechanics described above.

9 concluding comments

one of the purpose of this lecture was to explain the new concepts and new approaches

to strong gravity in the framework of supersymmetry. we are trying to understand new

issues in superstring theory, supergravity and superconformal eld theories. our current
interest in various aspects of ads  s supersymmetric geometry is based on the fact that this
near horizon geometry of d3, m2, m5 branes has 32 unbroken supersymmetry and is exact

and the isometries of the relevant superspace form the superconformal algebra. therefore

there is some hope that we are learning new connections between algebraic and geometric

concepts which may survive in the fundamental theory unifying quantum gravity with other

interactions.

8this antipodal map on s 2 does not seem to be related to the one described in the context of reality
of the analytic subspace of n=2 harmonic superspace.
it is interesting, however that in both cases this
operation is particular for the sphere which is part of curved geometry under consideration. antipodal map
has no analog in the at space.
