(may 1999, revised july 1999)

we argue that the wess-zumino model with quartic superpotential admits stable static solutions
in which three domain walls intersect at a junction. we derive an energy bound for such junctions
and show that congurations saturating it preserve 1/4 supersymmetry.

domain walls arise in many areas of physics. they
occur as solutions of scalar eld theories whenever the
potential is such that it has isolated degenerate minima.
there are two circumstances in which this happens natu-
rally. one is when a discrete symmetry is spontaneously
broken; in this case the degeneracy is due to the symme-
try. the other is when the eld theory is supersymmetric;
in this case the potential is derived from a superpoten-
tial, the critical points of which are degenerate minima
of the potential. a simple model illustrating the latter
case is the 3+1 dimensional (or d=4) wess-zumino (wz)
model with a superpotential w () that is a polynomial
function of the complex scalar eld . the static domain
wall solutions of this theory [1,2] are stable for topolog-
ical reasons but the stability can also be deduced from
the fact that a static domain wall is supersymmetric,
i.e. it partially preserves the supersymmetry of the vac-
uum. an advantage of the latter point of view is that
the condition for supersymmetry leads immediately to a
rst order bogomolnyi equation, the solutions of which
automatically solve the second order eld equations.

the possibilities for partial preservation of supersym-
metry in the wz model can be analysed directly in terms
of the n=1 d=4 supertranslation algebra. allowing for
all algebraically independent central charges, the matrix
of anticommutators of the spinor charge components s
is

{s, s} = h + 0ipi +

where h is the hamiltonian, pi the 3-momentum, u and
v are two 2-form charges, (0, i) are the 4  4 dirac
matrices and 5 = 0123. the fraction of supersymmetry
preserved by any conguration carrying these charges is
one quarter of the number of zero-eigenvalue eigenspinors
 of the matrix {s, s}. supersymmetric congurations
other than the vacuum will preserve either 1/2 or 1/4 of
the supersymmetry. a domain wall in the 1-3 plane, for
example, has (u13, v13) = h(cos , sin ) for some angle
 [1,3]; the corresponding spinors  are eigenspinors of
013 exp(5) from which it follows that the domain wall
preserves 1/2 supersymmetry. now consider a congura-
tion with non-zero h, u13 = u, v23 = v, all other charges
vanishing; such a conguration preserves 1/4 supersym-
metry if |u| + |v| = h, with  an eigenspinor of both

013 and 0235. such a conguration would naturally
be associated with domain walls in the 1-3 and 2-3 planes
intersecting on the 3-axis. in this paper we argue that
this possibility is realized in the wz model.

intersections of domain walls have been extensively
studied in the context of a theory with a single real scalar
eld  on e3 [46]. static congurations are presumed
to satisfy an equation of the form

2 = v () ,

(2)

where 2 is the laplacian on e3 and v () is a real pos-
itive function of  with two adjacent isolated minima at
which v vanishes. let these minima be at  = 1 and let
(x, y, w) be cartesian coordinates for e3. if one assumes
that   1 as x  , uniformly in y and w, then
solutions of (2) are necessarily planar because all [711]
such solutions satisfy the rst order ordinary dierential
equation

= v .

d
dx

(3)

the solutions of this equation are the static domain walls
which are stable for topological reasons. in the context
of a d=3 supersymmetric model they are also supersym-
metric, for reasons explained at the conclusion of this
article

now consider the possibility of static intersecting do-
main wall solutions of (2). an existence proof has been
given [4] showing that (2) admits a solution representing
two orthogonal domain walls. the solution has dirichlet
type boundary data :  = 0 on the planes x = 0 and
y = 0 and   1 as |x|   within the rst quadrant.
given that the solution exists in the rst quadrant, it
may be obtained in the remaining quadrants by reec-
tion. it seems clear, although we are unaware of formal
proofs, that there should also exist solutions for which
2n domain walls intersect, adjacent walls making an an-
gle /n. however all these intersecting solutions are ex-
pected to be unstable; it is certainly the case that they
cannot be supersymmetric. we shall return to this point
later.

domain walls with two or more scalar elds have been
investigated in [5,6,12]. in [5,6], three-phase boundaries
were shown to minimise the energy and to correspond, in

1

the thin-wall limit, to a y-intersection (with 120 degree
angles). the wz model is a special case of models of
this type. the energetics of domain wall intersections in
the wz model was investigated in [1] (see also [13]). the
possibilities depend on the form of the superpotential
w . if it is cubic then there are two possible domains and
only one type of domain wall separating them. intersec-
tions of two such walls cannot be more than marginally
stable. stable intersections can occur only if the super-
potential is at least quartic. a quartic superpotential can
therefore model a tri-stable medium with three possible
stable domains and three types of domain wall. the 1+1
dimensional analysis of [1] indicates that triple intersec-
tions of the three walls should be stable for some range of
parameters, but static solutions representing such inter-
sections are intrinsically 2+1 dimensional (given that we
ignore dependence on the coordinate of the string inter-
section), so they cannot be found from the truncation to
1+1 dimensions. however, they should be minimum en-
ergy solutions of the reduction of the wz model to 2+1
dimensions. the energy density of static congurations
in this reduced 2+1 dimensional theory is

h =

1
4    + |w ()|2

(4)

where  = (x, y) with (x, y) being cartesian coordi-
nates for the two-dimensional space.
let z = x + iy. the above expression for the energy

density can then be rewritten as

+ 2re(cid:18)ei w

z (cid:19) +

where  is an arbitrary phase, and

h = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where  is the 2-form on 2-space induced by the closed
2-form (i/4)d  d on the target space (assumed here to
be the complex plane). since  is real and closed, q is a
real topological charge. we may assume without loss of
generality that it is non-negative. integration over space
then yields the following expression for the energy

e  q + |t| ,

(10)

which is saturated by solutions of the bogomolnyi equa-
tion


z

= eiw  .

(11)

before considering what solutions this equation may
have, we shall rst show that generic solutions preserve
1/4 supersymmetry. the elds of the wz model reduced
to 2+1 dimensions comprise a complex scalar  and a
complex sl(2; r) spinor eld ; we use an sl(2; r)
notation in which

 = t + (1) x + (3)y

and  = . similarly,  = . the

(13)

note that the corresponding bosonic hamiltonian den-
sity is precisely (4). the action is invariant, up a surface
term, under the innitesimal supersymmetry transforma-
tions

 = 2i
 =    2w  ,

(14)

and their complex conjugates (we adopt the convention
that bilinears of real spinors are pure imaginary).

we see from (14) that purely bosonic congurations

are supersymmetric provided that the equation

  + 2w  = 0

(15)

admits a solution for some constant complex spinor .
for a time-independent complex eld  this equation is
equivalent to

(1  2) ( ) + (1 + 2) () = 2w  3

where   /z and   / z. for a eld  satisfying
(11) we deduce that  satises

2 =  ,

3 = ei .

(17)

these constraints preserve just one of the four super-
symmetries. solutions of (11) are therefore 1/4 super-
symmetric.

the supersymmetry noether charge of the above

model is the complex sl(2; r) spinor

where t is the complex boundary term

e = z dxdy (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

we thereby deduce the bogomolnyi-type bound

we can now use the canonical anticommutation relations
of the fermion elds to compute the anticommutators.
after restricting to static bosonic elds one nds that
{s, s} = h  2q. thus the junction charge q appears
as a central charge in the supertranslation algebra. the
charge t appears in the {s, s} anticommutator and the
positivity of the complete matrix of supercharges implies
the bound (10). of interest here is how the junction
charge q appears in the d=4 supersymmetry algebra
from which we started. it appears in the same way as
would the p3 component of the momentum and is asoci-
ated with the constraint 03 = . this constraint is
equivalent to 0235 =  on the +1 eigenspace of 013
so, indirectly, we have found a eld theory realization
of the 1/4 supersymmetric charge congurations that we
earlier deduced from the n=1 d=4 supersymmetry alge-
bra alone.

we now return to the bogomolnyi equation (11). if 
is restricted to be a function only of x then this equation
reduces to the one studied in [1], which admits domain
wall solutions parallel to the y-axis. each domain wall is
associated with a complex topological charge of magni-

tude |r dx xw| and phase . the question of stability

of domain wall junctions was adressed in [1] by asking
whether two domain walls parallel to the y-axis, at least
locally, can fuse to form a third domain wall of lower en-
ergy. it was found that this is possible only if their phases
dier; otherwise, stability is marginal. given that the en-
ergetics allows the formation of an intersection, we would
like to nd the static intersecting domain wall solution to
which the system relaxes. such solutions must depend on
both x and y (equivalently, on both z and z), and hence
are much harder to nd.

to simplify our task, we shall consider the simple quar-

tic superpotential,

w () = 

1
4

4 +  .

(19)

this has three critical points, at  = 1, , 2, and a z3
symmetry permuting them. there are therefore three
possible domains and three types of domain wall sepa-
rating them. the bogomolnyi equation corresponding
to this superpotential is


z

= 1  3 .

(20)

we have set the phase  = 1 since it can now be re-
moved by a redenition of z. this equation is invariant
under the z3 action : (z, )  (z, ), so we are led
to seek a z3 invariant solution such that   1 as one
goes to innity inside the sector  
6 , sub-
ject to the condition that arg  = arg z on the boundary.
by symmetry  must vanish at the origin and so   z
for small z. given that a stable static triple intersec-
tion exists, there should also exist meta-stable networks
of domain walls [14]. for example, one may imagine a
static lattice consisting of hexagonal domains, rather like

6 < arg z < 

graphite. the vertices form triple intersections and one
may consistently label the hexagons of the array with
1, , 2, in such a way that no two domains which touch
along a common edge carry the same label. the evolution
of networks of domain walls has been studied numerically
in [15]. we believe that it would be fruitful to study the
wz model in this context.

it is well known that topological defects such as strings
and domain walls admit wavelike excitations travelling
along them at the speed of light. the domain wall junc-
tions considered here are no exception. one easily checks
that the d=4 wz equations are satised if (z) solves
our bogomolnyi equation (11) but is also allowed to have
arbitrary dependence upon either t  w or t + w, where
w is the third space coordinate on which we reduced to
get the (2+1) dimensional model. however, only one
choice preserves supersymmetry. to see this we note
that the sl(2; c)-invariant condition for preservation of
supersymmetry in the unreduced d=4 wz model is

    + 2w  = 0 .

(21)

given that the reduced d=3 equation (15) is satised,
and that the spinor  satises (17), we then deduce that

+  = 0

(22)

where + = t  w, the sign depending on the choice of
conventions. thus, we again have 1/4 supersymmetry if
+ = 0 but no supersymmetry if  = 0. this result is
not unexpected because we saw earlier that the junction
charge q appears in the d=4 supersymmetry algebra in
the same way as does p3.

note that since an individual domain wall preserves
1/2 supersymmetry its low energy dynamics must be de-
scribed by a (2+1)-dimensional supersymmetric eld the-
ory with two supersymmetries (corresponding to n=1).
the two components of the spinor eld of this eec-
tive theory are the coecients of two nambu-goldstone
fermions associated with the broken supersymmetries.
the domain wall junction preserves only 1/4 supersym-
metry, so there must be a total of three nambu-goldstone
fermions localised on the intersecting domain wall con-
guration as a whole. only two of these are free to prop-
agate within the walls, so the third nambu-goldstone
fermion must be localised on the string junction. this
can also be seen by viewing the junction as a 1/2-
supersymmetric defect on a given wall. the fact that half
of the walls supersymmetry is preserved means that the
junctions low energy dynamics is described by a (1,0)-
supersymmetric (1+1) dimensional eld theory. this
theory is chiral with one fermion that is either left-moving
or right-moving; let us declare it to be left-moving. this
fermion is the nambu-goldstone fermion associated with
the fact that the junction also breaks half the walls su-
persymmetry. its bosonic partner under (1,0) supersym-
metry must also be left-moving.
it follows that right-
moving waves are supersymmetric whereas left-moving

[14] shortly after submission of this paper to the archives,
one by carroll, hellerman and trodden appeared (hep-
th/9905217) having a signicant overlap with the work
reported here. these authors have also pointed out to
us that networks of domain walls connected by 1/4 bbs
junctions are not themselves bps and can decay by a
tunelling process. we agree. we owe the following argu-
ment to p. san, who has conrmed the meta-stability
numerically. for a given orientation, each y junction
of the model we discuss is actually one of six possible
types, corrresponding to the action of z3 on a a given
y junction and its anti-junction, for which /z is re-
placed by / z in (20). in a hexagonal array, each of
the six junction types occurs once. since they are each
approximate solutions of dierent (albeit isomorphic) bo-
gomolnyi equations, the network cannot be bps.

ones are not, precisely as we deduced above from other
considerations.

now that we have a good understanding of the pattern
of supersymmetry breaking in the wz model we return to
the simpler model discussed earlier with one real scalar
eld. this model has an n=1 supersymmetrization in
(2+1) dimensions, with v = 4(w )2, obtained by re-
stricting all quantities in the n=2 model discussed above
to be real. taking y = 0 we then nd that solutions
of (3) are supersymmetric, with the real 2-component
spinor  an eigenspinor of 3. this might seem paradox-
ical in view of the fact that the n=1 d=3 supertransla-
tion algebra admits no central charges, of either scalar or
vector type, that are algebraically independent of the 3-
momentum. the resolution is that the anticommutator
of supersymmetry charges s is

{s, s} = h

+ (1) (px + ty) + (3) (py  tx)

(23)

where h is the hamiltonian, p is the eld 2-momentum

and t = r d2xw is a 2-vector topological charge (the

corrresponding algebra of currents was discussed in [16]).
for static solutions p vanishes, while yw vanishes for
solutions with y = 0. for such solutions we have

{s, s} = h + 3tx .

(24)

it follows that h  |tx|. field congurations that sat-
urate this bound preserve 1/2 the supersymmetry and
are associated with eigenspinors of 3, as claimed. an
intersecting domain wall solution in this n=1 (2+1)-
dimensional model cannot satisfy (3) (because its only
static solutions are the planar domain walls) and this
means that it cannot be supersymmetric.
in contrast
to the model with a complex scalar, one cannot use su-
persymmetry to argue for the stability of domain wall
junctions in a model with only one real scalar eld.
