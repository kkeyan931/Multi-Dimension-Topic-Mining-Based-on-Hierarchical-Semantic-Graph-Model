in this work a eld theoretical model is constructed to describe the sta-

tistical mechanics of an arbitrary number of topologically linked polymers in

the context of the analytical approach of edrwards. as an application, the

eects of the topological interactions are studied in the one loop approxima-

tion. a natural way to include in the treatment also more sophisticated link

invariants than the gauss linking number is outlined in the conclusions.

i. introduction

long exible polymer molecules provide an ideal environment to study the eects of

topology in statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics, but so far a comprehensive

theory of topologically linked polymers does not exist. until now, only the physics of un-

entangled open chains has been understood to a satisfactory extent [1]. in this letter the

problem is tackled in the context of the so-called analytical approach, consisting in a number

of dierent methods based on edwards pioneering work [2], in which the uctuations of each

polymers are treated as a random walk and described via a path integral in the wiener

sense. analytical approaches of this kind have already been applied to several complex sit-

uations [3]- [12] and seem very promising in explaining the physics of topological entangled

polymers. despite of that, they are aected by two main limitations. first of all, the gauss

linking number, a weak topological invariant, is used to distinguish the topological states of

the system. unfortunately, more sophisticated knot invariants like those described in [13]

1

and [14] cannot be applied in practice, since they have no immediate relation to the physical

conformation of the polymer [3]. on the other side, one of the advantages of the analytical

approach is to provide a eld theoretical description of a system of polymers, establishing

in this way a connection to the theory of critical phenomena in condensed matter and high

energy physics. however, a mapping from the statistical mechanical problem of polymers

to eld theories has been realized only in a limited number of cases, mainly concerning the

uctuations of a single test polymer in a background of static polymers or xed obstacles.

remarkable exceptions occur when two polymers are very close [8], [12], a situation which is

particularly relevant in the study of dna molecules [15], or when the number of polymers

becomes large [11]. despite of these successes, the exact analytical treatment of a system

of n polymers has been a formidable problem already mentioned in the pioneering work on

topological entanglement of brereton and shah [5] and remained unsolved until the present

days.

to solve it, we construct a chern-simons (c-s) [16] based model, which generalizes a

previous work of the authors in which the two polymer case was discussed [17]. with respect

to ref. [17], the main diculty is that one needs n (n 1)

2

independent topological numbers

to distinguish the possible topological states of n polymers according to the gauss link

invariant. as a consequence, one has to nd a suitable c-s eld theory which decouples

the actions of the polymers as in [17] and simultaneously is able to accommodate the huge

amount of topological congurations allowed by the system.

the material contained in this paper will be divided as follows.

in the next section

a topological ginzburg-landau model is constructed which describes the uctuations of a

system of n topologically linked polymers. the topological relations are specied using the

gauss linking number. section iii contains a perturbative study of the case n = 2. in par-

ticular, the one loop eective potential is computed proving that the topological interactions

do not inuence the critical behavior of the system in this approximation. moreover, it is

shown that the second topological moment can be exactly computed in terms of one loop

feynman diagrams. finally, a detailed discussion of the results has been given in section

2

iv. in that section a natural method to include higher order topological invariants is out-

lined. to this purpose, a new c-s eld theory is dened, which is abelian but exhibits cubic

interactions among the c-s elds. in this way such theory can generate radiative corrections

containing knot invariants with the same mechanism acting in the case of nonabelian string

theories [18], [19].

ii. the n polymers problem

let p1, . . . , pn be a set of topologically linked polymers, describing in the space the

trajectories i,

i = 1, . . . , n dened as follows:

i = {ri(si) |0  si  li ; ri(0) = r

i, ri(li) = ri}

(1)

where li denotes the contour length of i. the polymers can be either open or closed

(r

i = ri). the topological states will be distinguished using the gauss linking number:

(i, j) 

1

4 z li

0

z lj

0

dri(si)  drj(sj) 

(ri(si)  rj(sj))
|ri(si)  rj(sj)|3

(2)

where (i, j) takes integer values mij if i, j, i 6= j = 1, . . . , n, are closed trajectories.

to describe the statistical mechanics of the polymers we dene the conguration probability

g{m}({r}, {l}; {r}, 0). this function measures the probability that the trajectories i fulll

the constraints:

(i, j) = mij

i 6= j = 1, . . . , n

(3)

and have extrema (in the open case) at the points r

i and ri, i = 1, . . . , n. in our notations

{m} denotes the n  n symmetric matrix of topological numbers with elements

mij = mji

for

i 6= j

;

mii = 0

(4)

while {r} = r1, . . . , rn , {l} = l1, . . . , ln etc. starting from the path integral approach of

edwards [2], one obtains the following expression of g{m}({r}, {l}; {r}, 0):

3

g{m}({r}, {l}; {r}, 0) = z +



where

takes into account the excluded volume interactions. for convenience, v0

ij has been dened

as follows:

v0

v0
ij/2 for i 6= j

v0
ij = v0

ji

(9)

v0

ij = 


where the v0

ij are coupling constants with the dimension of a volume. finally, the topological

constraints (3) are responsible of the topological term:

atop = i

n 1

n

xi=1

xj=2

j>i

(i, j)ij

(10)

coming from the well known fourier transform of the dirac function:

(mij  (i, j)) = z +



dij
2

exp {i [mij  (i, j)] ij}

(11)

to express the congurational probability (6) in terms of elds, we introduce n gaussian

scalar elds i(r), i = 1, . . . , n and n(n  1) free c-s elds a(i)

(j) and b(i)

(j), with i =

1, . . . , n  1, j = 2, . . . , n and j > i. the action of the scalar elds is given by:

a =

a2
2

n

xi,j=1z d3ri[(v0)1]ijj

4

(12)

while c-s one is given by:

scs =



4 z d3r

n 1

n

xi=1

xj=2

j>i

a(i)

(j)  (  b(i)
(j))

(13)

the c-s theory will be quantized in the landau gauge, where the elds a(i)

(j) and b(i)

(j) are

completely transverse.

it turns out that the following relation is valid for the excluded

volume term:

where

eaev = z d1 . . . dn exp(a{}  i

n

xi=1z d3rji(r)i(r))

ji(r) = z li

0

dsi(3)(r  ri(si))

(14)

(15)

to treat the topological interaction it will be convenient to dene the following linear com-

binations of the elds a(i)

(j) and b(i)
(j):

c(1) =

(1)
(j)a(1)

(j)

n

xj=2

(16)

c(i) =

n

xj=3

j>i

(i)
(j)a(i)

(j) +

(j)
(i) b(j)

(i)

n 2

xj=1

j<i

i = 2, . . . , n  1

(17)

and

c(n ) =

(i)
(n )b(i)

(n )

n 1

xi=1

(18)

the parameters (i)

(j) and (i)

(j) depend on the c-s coupling constant  and on the matrix

elements ij as follows:

(i)
(j) =


4

(i)
(j) = ij

in terms of these elds c it is now possible to state the gaussian identity:

z dadb exp(iscs  i

n

xi=1z li

0

c(i)(r(si))dr(si)) = exp


5

xi=1

xj=2

j>i

ij(i, j)


(19)

(20)

eq. (20), where we have used the compact notation:

z dadb  z

n

yi<j=1

da(i)

(j)db(i)

(j)

(21)

relates the topological term (10) to the amplitude of n holonomies and will be central in the

subsequent discussion. substituting eqs. (20) and (14) in (6), the congurational probability

g{}({r}, {l}; {r}, 0) becomes:

g{}({r}, {l}; {r}, 0) = h

n

yi=1

g(ri, li; r

i, 0|i, c(i))i{},{a},{b}

(22)

in the above formula the functions g(ri, li; r

i, 0|i, c(i)) are given by:

g(ri, li; r

i, 0|i, c(i)) = z ri

r
i

dri(si)exp(z li

0

dsili(ri(si))  iz li

0

dsi ri(si)  c(i)(ri(si)))

where

li(ri(si)) =

3
2a

r2
i (si) + ii(ri)

(23)

(24)

moreover, everything inside the bracket h

i{},{a},{b} must be averaged with respect

to the elds {}, {a} and {b} by means of eqs.

(14) and (20). as we see from eqs.

(22)-(24) the polymer trajectories 1, . . . , n are completely decoupled before averaging

over the auxiliary elds. furthermore, each of the factors g(ri, li; r

i, 0|i, c(i)) appearing

inside the bracket h

i{},{a},{b} coincides formally with the evolution kernel of a particle

subjected to random walk (in the wiener sense of the path-integral formulation of statistical

mechanics) and immersed in the electromagnetic eld (ii, c(i)). thus g(ri, li; r

i, 0|i, c(i))

satises the pseudo-schrodinger equation [7]:

" 

li

6

d2

i + ii# g(ri, li; r

i, 0|i, c(i)) = (li)(ri  r
i)

the covariant derivatives di are given by:

di =  + ic(i)

i = 1, . . . , n

6

(25)

(26)

at this point it is convenient to consider the laplace transform of the congurational prob-

ability g{}({r}, {l}; {r}, 0) with respect to the polymer lengths [7]:

g{}({r}, {r}, {z}) = z +

0

dl1 . . .z +

0

dln exp(

n

xi=1

zili) g{}({r}, {l}; {r}, 0)

(27)

each variable zi plays the role of a boltzmann-like factor governing the distribution length

of the ith polymer. applying the above laplace transformations to the expression of

g{}({r}, {l}; {r}, 0) given by eq. (22), one nds:

g{}({r}, {r}, {z}) = h

n

yi=1

g(ri, r

i; zi|i, c(i))i{},{a},{b}

(28)

where the functions g(ri, r

i; zi|i, c(i)) are the laplace transforms of g(ri, li; r

i, 0|i, c(i)).

therefore, they obey the stationary pseudo-schroedinger equations:

(cid:20)zi 

a
6

d2

i + ii(cid:21) g(ri, r

i; zi|i, c(i)) = (ri  r
i)

(29)

the solution of eq.

(29) can be given in terms of second quantized elds elds 

i , i,

i = 1, . . . , n:

g(ri, r

i; zi|i, c(i)) = z 1

i

z did

i i(ri)

i (r

i)ef [i]

(30)

where f [i] represents the ginzburg-landau free energy of a superconductor in a uctuating

magnetic eld:

f [i] = z d3r(cid:20) a

6

|dii|2 + (zi + ii)|i|2(cid:21)

and zi is the partition function of the system:

zi = z did

i ef [i]

(31)

(32)

in order to eliminate the auxiliary elds i, we exploit the method of replica [20]. let

i

i

, i

i be a set of replica elds with i = 1, . . . , ni and i = 1, . . . , n, that form the

niples i = (1

i , . . . , ni

i ) and 

i = (1

i

, . . . , ni

i

). in terms of these elds the green

functions g(ri, r

i; zi|i, c(i)) become:

7

g(ri, r

i; zi|i, c(i)) = lim

ni0z did

i i

i (ri)i

i


i) e

(r

ni

pi=1

i
f [
i

]

(33)

where the is are arbitrary integers chosen in the range 1  i  ni. according to the

replica method, we also assume that the limit for ni going to zero commutes with the

functional integrations over the c-s elds and the auxiliary elds i. substituting eq. (33)

in (28) and performing the gaussian integration over the i, one obtains:

g{}({r}, {r}, {z}) =

lim

n1,...,nn 0z dadb

n

yi=1

[did
i ]

n

yj=1hj

j (rj)i

i

(r

i)i exp {a({}, {a}, {b})}

(34)

where the polymer free energy a({}, {a}, {b}) is given by:

a({}, {a}, {b}) = iscs+

n

xi=1z d3r(cid:20)a

6

|dii|2 + zi|i|2(cid:21) +

n

xi,j=1

v0
ij

2a2 |z d3r|i|2|j|2

(35)

from the above equation we see that the elds i, 

i have the dimension of a mass, which

is not the canonical dimensionality of the scalar elds in three dimensions. to remedy, we

introduce a new mass parameter m [21]. it is nice to see that in this way it is possible to

dene an analog of the planck constant:

performing the eld rescaling



i = s m

2

h =

ma

3

i



i = s m

2


i

and working in units in which h = 1, the action (35) becomes:

an ({}, {a}, {b}) = iscs +

n

xi=1z d3rh

i (d2

i + m2

(36)

(37)

(38)

where the covariant derivatives are dened as before by eq. (26) and

m2

i = 2mzi

(39)

from now on, we will always use the rescaled action (38) and the prime indices carried by

the complex scalar elds will be dropped.

iii. the two polymers case

in the two polymers case the matrix mij of topological numbers is replaced by a single

topological number m which describes the intersections of the trajectories 1 and 2. its

fourier conjugate variable will be called . it will also be convenient to put:

and

a(1)

(2) = a(1)

b(1)

(2) = a(2)

(1)
(2) = 1

(1)
(2) = 2

in this new notation the action (38) becomes:

a2({}, {a}) = i



4 z d3ra(1)  (  a(2)) +

2

xi=1z d3rh

i (d2

i + m2

i )ii

where

+

xi,j=1

2m 2v0
ij

a2

z d3r|i|2|j|2

di =  + iia(i)

(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)

accordingly, the congurational probability g{}({r}, {r}, {z}) can be written as follows in

the two polymers case:

g({r}, {r}, {z}) =

9

lim

(44)

since we are interested in the eects of the topological interactions, we neglect the excluded

volume interactions setting v0

ij = 0 in the remaining of this section.

 . these contributions

to the eective potential are identically zero in the landau gauge.

the other possible diagrams are in fact of the form given in g. (2) and are suppressed

in the landau gauge [22]. first of all one needs to derive the feynman rules starting from

the action (42). here we just state the result:

(47)

(48)

after some calculations, one obtains the following expression of the eective potential at

one loop order:

vef f ({}) =

m2

i |i|2 

22

(49)

in eq. (49)  is an ultraviolet cut-o with the dimension of a mass. due to the fact that

the microscopic scale of our model is given by the step length a, phenomena whose spatial

extensions are smaller than a have no meaning [7], so that we can put:

  a1

(50)

from eq. (49) one sees that the total eect of the topological forces at one loop is to inuence

the strength of the repulsions among the polymers. in particular, topological forces do not

aect the scaling behavior of the system. indeed, only the last term appearing in the second

member of eq. (49) may inuence the critical behavior of the topological ginzburg-landau

model (38), but it is of higher order in the numbers of replicas n1 and n2. therefore, it does

not contribute in the congurational probability (34), after the limit n1, n2  0 is taken.

the simplest observable that can be computed within the above approach is the second

topological moment

hm2i = r 
r 

 m2gm({r}, {r}, {z})
 gm({r}, {r}, {z})

(51)

here gm({r}, {r}, {z}) is easily evaluated by taking the inverse fourier transformation with

respect to  of the congurational probability (44). this has been done in ref. [17]. in the

case of the second topological moment one nds after some calculations:

let us notice that in the action a0 the eld a(2) plays the role of a lagrange multiplier. as

a consequence, after performing the integration in a(2) in eq. (54), the eld a(1) becomes

trivial, so that the path integral z0 actually describes the uctuations of two free polymers.

fig. 3. this gure shows all the diagrams contributing to the second topological moment to-

gether with the weights they appear in the expression of hm2i.

the path integral appearing in the numerator of eq. (52) is instead more complicated.

nevertheless it is possible to show that, in the absence of excluded volume interactions,

the only contributions to hm2i come from the one loop diagrams of g. (3). in this way

the second topological moment can be exactly computed. physically, one is interested to

study the topological moments as a function of the length of the polymers. this requires a

slight modication of the above approach to compute directly the congurational probability

g{}({r}, {l}; {r}, 0). the details of this calculation will be presented elsewhere.

iv. conclusions

in the previous sections the statistical-mechanical problem of an arbitrary number of

topologically entangled polymers has been mapped to a topological ginzburg-landau model,

solving in this way a longstanding problem rstly pointed out in ref. [5]. in our model the c-s

elds acquire a physical signicance, since they propagate the forces acting on the polymers

due to the presence of the topological constraints. of course, the topological forces should

not distinguish a polymer from the other, a principle that is apparently violated by our choice

of coupling constants in eq. (19). however, explicit calculations show that this symmetry is

not spoiled and actually puts severe constraints on the number of possible feynman diagrams

to be computed in the perturbative approach. for instance, one recognizes from eq. (49)

and g. (3) that the contributions to the one loop eective potential and to the second

topological moment are completely symmetric in the elds 1, 

1 and 2, 

2. a related

problem is the appearance of a spurious parameter in the polymer free energy (38), namely

the c-s coupling constant . also in this case it is easy to see that the diculty is only

apparent, since it is possible to remove the dependency on  with a simple rescaling of the

elds a(i)
(j).

in our construction the topological forces acting on each couple of trajectories i and

j are propagated only by the two elds a(i)

(j) and b(i)

(j). for that reason, the calculations

performed in the case of two polymers can be extended also to an arbitrary number of

polymers in a straightforward way. in this way it is possible to conclude from the analysis

of section iii that the topological interaction does not change the critical behavior of the

system at least in the one loop approximation.

as already mentioned in the introduction, the gauss linking number is a rather poor

knot invariant. however, the eld theoretical formulation of topologically linked polymers

established here shows a natural way to include higher order topological interactions. this

is achieved by adding to the action (38) a new contribution of the form:

13

aint

n =

n 1

xi,j,k=1

n

xl,m,n=2

i<l;j<m;k<n

z d3x(cid:16)ijk

(n) + . . .(cid:17) (55)

lmna(i)

(l)a(j)

(m) a(k)

(n) + ijk

lmna(i)

(l)a(j)

(m) b(k)

each term appearing in the above sum is topological and does not vanish apart from special

combinations of the indices i, j, k, l, m, n, in which two or three c-s elds coincide. clearly,

interactions as those given in eq. (55) generate corrections to the congurational probability

g{}({r}, {l}; {r}, 0) that contain higher order link invariants.

in perturbation theory

these corrections can be computed order by order with techniques similar to those already

exploited in the case of nonabelian c-s eld theories [18], [19]. to enforce the new topological

constraints through dirac functions as in eq. (3), one has to introduce additional fourier

variables besides the parameters ijs. the possibility of dening the coupling constants

ijk
lmn, ijk

lmn etc.

in terms of these variables in a way that is suitable to impose relations on

higher order link invariants is still an open problem and deserves more investigations.
