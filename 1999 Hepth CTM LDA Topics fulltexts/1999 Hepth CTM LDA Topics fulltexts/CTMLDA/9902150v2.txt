by the use of an eective superpotential in supersymmetric quantum chromodynamics (sqcd)
with nf avors and nc colors of quarks for nf  nc+2, the inuence of soft supersymmetry
(susy) breakings is examined to clarify dynamics of chiral symmetry breakings near the susy
limit. in case that sqcd triggers spontaneous chiral symmetry breakings, it is possible to show
that our superpotential dynamically favors the successive formation of condensates, leaving either
su (nf  nc) or su (nf  nc + 1) unbroken as a chiral nonabelian symmetry.

i. introduction

it has been argued that n =1 supersymmetric quantum chromodynamics (sqcd) with nf avors and nc colors of
massless quarks exhibits chiral su (nf )  u (1) symmetry which, in the conning phase, will be spontaneously broken
for nf  nc and will remain unbroken for nf  nc+1. unbroken chiral symmetries are dynamically supported by
non-perturbative superpotential [1,2] and algebraically by the t hooft anomaly-matching conditions [3]. however,
the suggested dynamics of sqcd with nf  nc+2 are based on plausible extrapolation from the one respecting the
marvelous duality in n =2 supersymmetric (susy) gauge thoeries [4]. to utilize this duality in sqcd, magnetic
quarks are set to contribute in the physics of sqcd. the dynamics of magnetic quarks are not derived but arranged,
by our convenience, so as to fulll the algebraic requirement from the anomaly-matching conditions. once such
magnetic quarks are admitted to participate in sqcd, every other physical consequences will correctly follow and
a massive number of consistency checks are presented [5].

however, who is the magnetic quark? the answer can be found in sqcd embedded in a softly broken n =2 sqcd
[6,7], where the scale invariance of the n =2 theory plays a crucial role. the magnetic quarks can be identied with
those appearing in the n =2 sqcd. such a description of the n =1 duality in terms of the n =2 duality is expected
to be consistent with a correct physics in sqcd with 3nc/2 < nf < 3nc, where the phase is characterized as an
interacting coulomb phase [1]. on the other hand, in sqcd with nf  3nc/2, where connement will take place, no
direct convincing derivation of desired physics of magnetic quarks has been made. it is, thus, reasonable to start
seeking other possibilities than sqcd with magnetic quarks, in another words, the possibility of spontaneously
broken chiral su (nf ) symmetry [8].

in sqcd with nf  nc+2, low-energy chiral symmetry of electric quarks cannot sit on the origin of moduli
space, where no vacuum expectation values are generated, since no set of composite superelds that perfectly satises
the anomaly-matching conditions is found. to maintain full chiral symmetry as quantum chiral symmetry, it has
been conjectured [1] that the theory experiences phase transition to its magnetic phase, whose weak coupling regime
corresponds to the conned sqcd in the electric phase. the anomalies in the electric theory turn out to be
balanced by those from hypothetical magnetic quarks. however, in spite of the well-motivated physical view, one
may consider a conventional option that the theory undergoes successive spontaneous symmetry breakdown until the
anomaly-matching is realized by nambu-goldstone superelds together with other chiral composite superelds [9].

the dynamical requirement on the phase transition from the electric phase to the magnetic phase is replaced by
the alternative requirement on the spontaneous chiral symmetry breakdown in the electric phase. both dynamics
in sqcd are equally possible to be realized.

in the present article, dynamics of chiral symmetry breaking is examined to gain more insight into physics of sqcd.
since susy is broken in the real physics, the smooth susy limit of softly broken sqcd [10,11] is also emphasized
in our study. our analyses are performed by the use of the eective superpotential of the veneziano-yankielowicz
type [1214], which, at the susy vacuum, becomes equivalent to the seibergs superpotential [1,15].
it will be,
then, demonstrated that there is a solution that indicates spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. once one vacuum
expectation value (vev) is set non-vanishing, dynamics forces other vevs to be generated so that at most either
su (nf  nc) or su (nf  nc + 1) becomes a residual nonabelian chiral symmetry. in the susy breaking phase, all
remaining chiral symmetries will get broken. in the next section 2, our superpotential is formulated. performed in
the section 3 is the examination on property of the superpotential together with soft susy breaking terms. the last
section is devoted to summary.

ii. superpotential

our general strategy is to utilize an arbitrariness appearing in an eective superpotential that cannot be eliminated
by a symmetry principle only [13,16] just as in the seibergs superpotential for sqcd with nf = nc+1. the
superelds describing low-energy massless spectra are assumed to come from chiral meson superelds (t ) made
by a quark-antiquark pair and chiral (anti)baryon superelds (b( b)) by nc-quarks (nc-antiquarks). furthermore,
chiral exotic meson superelds (u ) made by (nc  1)-quarks and (nc  1)-antiquarks are allowed to participate
in our analyses. combinations of color-singlet states such as, by abbreviated notations, bt nf nc b/det(t ) (=zb)
and u t nf nc+1/det(t ) (=zu ) are totally neutral under entire chiral symmetries as well as an anomalous u (1)
symmetry. therefore, an eective superpotential determined by a symmetry principle can involve any function of zb
and zu as f (zb, zu ). the formation of h0|zb|0i (6= 0) (or h0|zu |0i) leads to the unbroken chiral su (nf  nc) (or
su (nf  nc + 1)) symmetry. for su (nf  nc), massless elds are contained in t , b and b while for su (nf  nc + 1)
they are contained in u as well.

our eective superpotential, wef f , for nc > 2 is dened to be

wef f = s(cid:26)ln(cid:20) sncnf det (t ) f (zb, zu )

3ncnf

(cid:21) + nf  nc(cid:27) ,

(1)

where  is a scale of sqcd and s is a color-singlet bilinear of a chiral gauge supereld, whose scalar component is 
with  being a gaugino. the decoupling property is manifest as discussed in ref. [12]. because the anomaly-matching
conditions are not satised in the full chiral symmetry, it must spontaneously break down to the next stage where
all anomalies present in residual chiral symmetries are consistently generated by massless composite superelds. the
susy vacuum characterized by i (i = 1 nf ) = b = b = u =  = 0 is not dynamically allowed. denoted by

to proceed to discussing eects from soft susy breakings, let us include breaking terms in a potential, v = vsu sy

xi=1

|wef f ;i|2) + gb(xi=b,b

|wef f ;i|2)

+ gu |wef f ;u|2 + gs|wef f ;|2,

(4)

where wef f ;i = wef f /i etc. and gt = gt (t t ) characterizes a kinetic term for t dened by the kahlar potential,
t and similarly for gb = gb(bb + b b), gu =
k, which is assumed to be diagonal as 2k/t k
gu (u u ) and gs = gs(ss). the susy-breaking is induced by soft breaking masses denoted by li, ri, i and
m through lmass for scalar quarks, a
a with tr()=0 (a,b=1nc) generally
expressed as:

i , scalar antiquarks, a

it is not necessary for the later discussions that all of s are eective. on the contrary to li,ri, is explicitly
break chiral su (nf ) symmetry and m, chiral u (1) symmetry. however, once the breaking masses are generated,
their mass scales are expected to be of the same order. since physics very near the susy-invariant vacua is our main
concern, all breaking masses are kept much smaller than . for composite superelds, lmass is translated into vsof t
that can be cast into the following form with higher orders in scalar masses neglected:

iii. spontaneous breaking

now, let us consider a conning phase where t , b and b serve as massless composites. the favored number of i
with vevs = o(2) will be shown to be nc. since dynamics calls for some of s to acquire non-vanishing vevs,
suppose that one of i (i=1  nf ) develops a vev, which can be labeled by i = 1 as |1| = 2
t  2. the conditions
on i including h0|zb|0i = zb are simply given by

gt w

it should be noted that the eects of eld dependent kinetic terms can be regarded as extra sources of soft susy

(i=1 nc) be of the same order, i.e. gt w 
0 is satised by any values of i including i = 0 as long as  = 0. on the other hand, in the extreme case, where
l1,r1,1=0, there is a solution of i=2nf = b(b) =  = 0 in the susy limit, which, however, cannot be dynamically
allowed since the anomaly-matching conditions for the residual chiral symmetries are not fullled. therefore, in the
general case, where all soft breaking masses are of the same order, the susy vacuum is characterized by

ef f ;1/1 =    = gt w 

1  0 as far as m 2

ef f ;nc

thus yielding su (nc)l+r. in other words, the spontaneous breaking is once triggered, then |i=1nc | = 2

it will be consistent to demand that f (zb) = 0 provides the classical constraint of det(t ) =

than unity.

with this kept in mind, we further compute (7) and similar constraints on i=nc+1nf and b(b), which turn out

these solutions indicate, in softly broken sqcd, the breakdown of all chiral symmetries that is in agreement with
the dynamics of ordinary qcd [17]. in the susy limit of i=nc+1nf  0 owing to   0, chiral su (nf  nc)
symmetry gets preserved. the constraint will arise to ensure the positivity of the right hand side of (15)  (17). for
instance, (16) and (17) using the denition of m2 give w 
ef f ; > 0. it should be noted that m 2
b can take any values
depending upon the explicit form of gb, which has been so far unknown, because the term g

for  > 0. the seibergs superpotential for sqcd with nf = nc+1 that corresponds to the =1 case is not unique in
the sense that the former case with an determined parameter, , also describes the same physical properties including
the decoupling property. our main nding is that wef f in the present form dynamically triggers the successive
formation of condensates once one vev such as h0|t 1
can be made visible by watching the behavior of sqcd with soft susy breakings in its susy limit. it has been
demonstrated that, to be consistent, soft susy breakings are constrained to include terms of the scalar components
with non-vanishing vevs [18].
i (i=elds without
vev) as far as the susy-breaking masses are of the same order. the residual symmetry turns out to include either
su (nc)l+r  su (nf  nc)l  su (nf  nc)r or su (nc  1)l+r  su (nf  nc + 1)l  su (nf  nc + 1)r.
the susy breaking further induces spontaneously breakdown of the residual nonabelian chiral symmetry as in (19),
which is in accord with the result in ordinary qcd physics [17] that all chiral symmetries are spontaneously broken.
the details of the anomaly-matching conditions as well as the possible application to physics of composite quarks and
leptons have been discussed [16].

1 |0i(cid:12)(cid:12)=0 is rst set non-vanishing. such successive formation

it is reasonable since m 2

i (i=elds with vev ( )) >> m 2

it should be noted that the present breakings include a spontaneous breakdown of vector symmetries such as
su (nf )l+r to su (nc)l+r  su (nf  nc)l+r [19]. the similar breakdown of a vector symmetry has been already
found to occur in sqcd with nf = nc that permits the breaking of u (1) of the baryon number. these breakings are
precisely determined by the dynamics regulated by a relevant eective superpotential, where the anomaly - matching
is a dynamical consequence.

our suggested physical view on symmetry breaking is that the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken to the
vectorial su (nc) symmetry for nf  nc [1,12] and nf  nc + 2 (or to su (nc  1) for nf  nc + 2) as a remnant of
qcd. and perhaps the same breaking is dynamically generated in sqcd with nf = nc + 1 although the algebraic
anomaly-matching consistency allows the solution of the unbroken chiral su (nf ) symmetry in the electric phase.
we expect that this physics in the electric phase probably persists in sqcd with nf  3nc/2 while sqcd with
3nc/2 < nf < 3nc will be in the interacting nonabelian coulomb phase [1], where the n =2 duality can be transmitted.
whether h0|t i
vacua of the dierent phase. it is our hope that this issue can be addressed by future lattice calculations that reveal
the real physics of sqcd [20], although the possibility of testing our proposed superpotential remains quite remote.

i |0i(cid:12)(cid:12)=0 is vanishing or non-vanishing is a purely dynamical problem since both are the correct susy

note added: there is a work done by n. arkani-hamed and r. rattazzi [21] who have discussed the similar subject
on an instability of the magnetic phase of sqcd near the susy limit and also have pointed out the possiblity of
the spontaneous breaking of su (nf )l+r.
