1 introduction

the scalar eld model with potential u() = m2

6! 6 is the simplest model
exhibiting a rich phase structure and for studying tricritical phenomena in both two and

2 2 + 

4! 4 + 

three dimensional systems [see, e.g. refs.

[1] and [2]]. in terms of the phase diagram

for the model, a tricritical point can emerge whenever we have three phases coexisting

simultaneously. for the above potential, in the absence of corrections due to uctuations,

one can have a second order transition in m when the scalar eld mass vanishes and

 > 0,  > 0. a rst order transition happens for the case of  < 0,  > 0. the tricritical

point occurs when the quartic coupling constant vanishes (with m = 0,  > 0). a study

of the phase diagram for this model in 3d, at nite temperature, was recently done [3]
and it has been shown that there is a temperature 1(m, , ) for which the physical

thermal mass m and coupling constant  vanishes, thus characterizing the tricritical

point.

there are many possible applications associated with the model with potential u()
with 6 interaction. for instance, in d = 2, it is known [4] that the minimal conformal

quantum eld theory, with central charge 7/10 (the tricritical ising model) is in the

same universality class, in the scaling region near the tricritical point, of the landau-
ginzburg model with the above potential. this 6 potential model can then be thought

of as the continuum realization of the ising model with possible applications in, e.g.,

the description of adsorbed helium on krypton-plated graphite [5], in understanding the
statistical mechanics of binary mixtures, such as he3  he4 [6], etc. these are just a
few examples of systems exhibiting tricritical phenomena in condensed matter physics.

in eld theory in general, the 6 model has been used in the study of polarons, or

solitonic like eld congurations on systems of low dimensionality [1]. also, a gauged
(su(2)) version of the 6 potential model in euclidean 3d, has recently been used to study

a possible existence of a tricritical point in higgs models at high temperatures [7]. in this

context the tricritical point is characterized by the ratio of the quartic coupling constant

and the gauge coupling constant of the eective three-dimensional theory, obtained from

the 3 + 1 d high temperature, dimensionally reduced su(2) higgs model. this can be

particularly useful in the context of the study of the electroweak phase transition.

2

there are then many reasons that make the 6 potential model an interesting model

to be studied. in this paper, we will be particularly interested in studying the regime of

parameters for which:

m2 > 0 ,  < 0 ,  > 0 and 
3!!2
  

5!
 4m2 
 > 0 .

(1)

in this case u() has three relative minima t and f (see fig. 1). for these parameters
the system has metastable vacuum states and it may exhibit a rst order phase transition.
the states of the classical eld theory for which  = t are the unique classical states
of lowest energy (true vacuum) and, at least in perturbation theory, they correspond to

the unique vacuum states of the quantum theory. the state of the classical eld theory

for which  = f is a stable classical equilibrium state. however, it is rendered unstable

by quantum eects, i.e., barrier penetration (or over the barrier thermal uctuations, at

nite temperatures). f is the false vacuum (the metastable state).

we will compute the vacuum decay (tunneling) rate at both zero and nite temper-

ature. for calculation reasons we will restrict ourselves to the thin wall approximation

for the true vacuum bubble (or bounce solution). we then consider the energy-density

dierence between the true and false vacuum as very small as compared with the height

of the barrier of the u() potential [9, 13]. from this, we are able to give the explicit

expression for the bounce and also to qualitatively describe the eigensolutions for the

bounce conguration. the paper is organized as follows: in sec. ii we obtain the bounce

eld conguration for the model and we compute the euclidean action in the thin wall

approximation. in sec. iii we calculate the vacuum decay rate at zero temperature and

we discuss the eigenvalue equations obtained for the bounce conguration within the ap-

proximations we have taken for the bounce. in sec. iv we compute the nucleation rate

at nite temperature, following the procedure given in [14]. in sec. v the concluding

remarks are given. in this paper we use h = c = kb = 1.

2 the vacuum decay rate and the bounce solution

let us consider a scalar eld model, in three-dimensional space-time, with euclidean

action given by

with

se() = z d3xe(cid:20) 1

u() =

(3)

as discussed in the introduction, we are interested in the regime for which the parameters

in (3) satises (1), such that the potential u() exhibits non-degenerate local minima and

then metastable states. the picture we have in mind is that once the system is prepared

in the false vacuum state, it will evolve to the true vacuum state by tunneling (at zero

temperature) or by bubble nucleation, triggered by thermal uctuations over the potential

barrier.

in the case of quantum eld theory at zero temperature the study of the decay of

false vacuum was initiated by voloshin, kobsarev and okun [8] and later by callan and

coleman [9, 10], who developed the so called bounce method for the theory of quantum

decay. in this context the decay rate per unit space-time volume v3 is given by

3/2"det (2e + u(b))
y2 , u() = d2u ()

ese (1 + o(h)) ,

(4)

d2

where 2e =  2
and se = se(b)  se(f ). se(b) is
the euclidean action evaluated at its extreme (specically a saddle point),  = b, where
b is the bounce: a solution of the eld equation of motion, se/|=b = 0, with the
appropriate boundary conditions. the prime in the determinantal prefactor in (4) means
that the three zero eigenvalues (the translational modes) of the [2e + u(b)] operator
has been removed from it.

as it was shown by coleman, glaser and martin [11], the solution that minimizes se
is a spherical symmetric solution, r2 =  2 + x2 + y2 (in d dimensions the solution has

4

o(d) symmetry) and then b can be written as the solution of the radial equation of

motion

d2b

= u(b) ,

(5)

with the boundary conditions: limr b(r) = f and db

dr |r=0 = 0.

at nite temperature the calculation of the decay rate were rst considered in [12]

in the context of quantum mechanics and later by linde [13], for quantum eld theory.

in [13], it is argued that temperature corrections to the nucleation rate are obtained

recalling that nite temperature eld theory (at suciently high temperatures) in d =

d + 1 dimensions is equivalent to d-dimensional euclidean quantum eld theory with h
substituted by t . at nite temperature, the bounce, b  b() ( = |r|), is a static
solution of the eld equation of motion:

(6)

d |=0 = 0. the vacuum decay
with boundary conditions:
rate, or bubble nucleation rate in this case, is proportional to ee/t , where e is the

lim b() = f and db

nucleation barrier, given by ( = 1/t )

e
t

= z d2x [le(b)  le(f )] ,

(7)

where le is the euclidean lagrangian density.

the problem of the computation of the nucleation rate at nite temperature was

recently reconsidered by gleiser, marques and ramos [14], who have used the early works

of langer [15]. in this context the nucleation rate is given by

() = |e|



im" det [2e + u(b)]

det [2e + u(f )] #1/2

ee/t (1 + o(h)) ,

(8)

where e2

 is the negative eigenvalue associated to the operator [2e + u(b)].

to compute the vacuum decay rates, we need, therefore, to solve eq. (5) for b(r)

(at zero temperature), or eq. (6) for b() (at nite temperature). in the model studied

here, we can give an approximate analytical treatment for the bounce solution in the so

5

 = 

called thin-wall approximation, in which case the energy-density dierence between the

false and true vacuum states can be considered very small, as compared to the height of
the potential barrier: 0 = u(f )  u(t)  u(2) (see fig. 1). by interpreting b as
a position and r as the time, eq. (5) can be seen as a classical equation of motion for a
particle moving in a potential u() and subject to a viscous like damping force, with
stokess law coecient inversely proportional to the time. the particle motion can then

be interpreted as it was released at rest, at time zero (because of the boundary condition
db
dr |r=0 = 0). from (5) it follows that
dr !2
2   db

dr !2

(9)

meaning that the particle loses energy. then, if the initial position of the particle is chosen

to be at the left of some value  = 1 (see fig. 2), it will never reach the position f .

now, for b(r) very close to t, we can linearize eq. (5) to obtain

" d2
dr2 +

dr  2# (b  t) = 0 ,

where 2 = u(t). the solution of (10) is

b  t = ((0)  t)

.

(10)

(11)

therefore, if we choose the position of the particle to be initially suciently close to t, we

can arrange for it to stay arbitrarily close to t for arbitrarily large r. but for suciently

large r, r = r, the viscous damping force can be neglected, since its coecient is inversely

proportional to r. and if the viscous damping is neglected, the particle will reach the

position f at a nite time r + r. then, by continuity, there must be an initial position

between t and 1 for which the particle will come to rest at f , after an innity time.
from the above arguments, we can nd a general expression for b, valid for 0  u(2).
in order to not lose too much energy, we must choose b(0), the initial position of the

particle, very close to t. the particle then stays close to t until some very large time,
r = r. near r (between r  r and r + r, r  r) the particle moves quickly
(according to eq. (5), neglecting the viscous damping force), through the valley in fig.

2 and it slowly comes to rest at f , after an innity time. thus, we can write for the

bounce the following expression (f = 0)

in the next two sections, we deal with the evaluation of the determinantal prefactor

appearing in eqs. (4) and (8) and we obtain the subsequent radiative (1-loop) corrections

to (21).

let us consider, initially, the eigenvalue equations for the dierential operators appearing

in (4):

and 2
wall (the negative eigenvalue) will be
e2

we were not able to nd any analytical solution for eq. (41), which it is even harder

to solve, due to the boundary conditions. we are currently working on the numerical

solution for the eigenvalues, whose results will be reported elsewhere.

4 the nucleation rate at finite temperature

at nite temperature, the bounce solution is a static solution of the eld equation of
motion, se/|=b() = 0, where b() is given as in (12), with bubble radius  and
thickness   . wall = wall() is still expressed as in (19). to calculate the determi-
nantal prefactor in (8), we consider the eigenvalue equations for the dierential operators:

analogously to the zero temperature case, the dierential operator 2 +u(b) has now
two zero eigenvalues (related to the translational modes in the two-dimensional space).
the multiplicity of (64) is two for all s 6= 0 and for s = 0 the multiplicity is one.
then for s = 1 and lower n (we choose 1) we will have e2
wall(1, 1) = 0 and then

5 conclusions

in this paper we have studied the evaluation of the vacuum decay rates, at both zero
temperature and at nite temperature, for the 6 model in d = 3, when the parameters

of the model satises the conditions given in (1). our main results were the determi-

nation of the expression for the bounce solution, eqs. (12) and (19), and also, despite

16

of the diculties for nding the solutions for the bounces wall eigenvalue problem, by

taking consistent considerations for the eld equations we have at hand (like the thin-wall

approximation), we were able to perform a detailed analysis of the bounce negative and

zero eigenvalues. we have also given a set of eigenvalue equations, which can be use-

ful in a more detailed analysis of this problem using, e.g. numerical methods. in [1] it
was analyzed the phase structure for the 6 model in d = 2 in the lattice and it was

also studied the possible production of topological and nontopological excitations in the

model. by remembering that at high temperatures our model in d = 3 resembles the

d = 2 model at zero temperature, it will be interesting to apply the method and results

we have obtained here to the problem studied in [1] for the regime of a rst order phase

transition.
