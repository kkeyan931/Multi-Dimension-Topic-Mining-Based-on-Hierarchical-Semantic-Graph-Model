abstract

we consider the construction of a general tree level amplitude for the interac-
tions between dynamical dbranes where the congurations have nonzero odd spin
structure. using riemann theta identities we map the conditions for the preser-
vation of some supersymmetry to a set of integer matrices satisfying a simple but
nontrivial equation. we also show how the regularization of the rr zero modes
plays an important role in determining which congurations are permitted.

1 introduction

one of the most important ways for probing the non-perturbative aspects of superstrings

and mtheory is the use of dpbranes [1, 2, 3]. these extended objects can be described

by the string theoretic boundary state formalism [4, 5, 6] which provides brst invariant

solutions and allows many features of the branes to be expressed in a simple way.

in

particular, it gives relative ease for turning on of electromagnetic elds on the branes

and the application of lorentz boosts and rotations [7, 8, 9]. from duality the results

derived from this approach can also provide information regarding congurations of d

branes with nsbranes and mbranes.

the formalism is also useful for understanding the properties of the tree level ampli-

tudes formed when two dbranes interact via a closed string. supersymmetry arguments

require that this amplitude will vanish as long as the conguration of branes retain at

least a fraction of the supersymmetry. for the most part this has been done by utilizing

the properties of the abtruse identity. however, also required is that the contribution to

the amplitude from the odd rr sector vanishes. since this is proportional to the theta

function 1,1(zi) this occurs when the parameter zi is equal to zero.

recently, it has become apparent that there are a variety of dierent congurations

of dbranes where 1,1(zi) 6= 0. moreover, these congurations preserve a fraction of the

supersymmetry despite the nonzero contribution from the odd rr sector. this is the

case for the generic situation when we apply all possible transformations and turn on all

the elds in a conguration between two branes or a brane and an antibrane [10, 11].

they also arise when one examines congurations of a brane with a brane - antibranes

system [12] and when the interacting branes are hodge dual to each other [13] . it the

understanding of how these cases preserve supersymmetry and what fraction thereof that

this paper will investigate.

in the process of this we examine which congurations are actually permitted. it is
not trivial to consider congurations of any dpdp system due to complications arising

from the fermionic zero modes in the rr sector. the standard normalization permits

1

only cases were |p  p| = 0, 8. however, in the presence of elds and transformations
the normalization is altered and the allowed values of p  p changes. the resolution to

handling these changes is to use a technique originally developed by yost [14] which we

will generalize to more arbitary congurations.

in section 2 we construct the boundary state for a dpbrane carrying arbitary elds

and under a general lorentz transformation. in section 3 we evaluate the corresponding

tree level amplitudes and study the regularization method needed to handle the rr zero

modes. section 4 deals with riemann theta identities and it is shown how they can be

used to classify the supersymmetry of the amplitudes in terms of integer valued matrices.

an earlier work [10] made progress in this direction and oered a proof of one of the

riemann theta identities. we extend this work and show how their results are a specic

example of ours.

2 boundary states

we assume a at dp-brane in ten dimensions upon which we perform various lorentz

transformations and turn on external electric and magnetic elds. the general boundary

term in the action performing this takes the form

sb = i dcx  



x 

(1)

corresponding to constant eld strengths and velocities; and where  = ,  appropriately.

the constraints dening the boundary state |bi are given by summing over , viz.

c




x |bi =   



(gx ) +




(f x )! |bi = 0

(2)

imposing brst and virasoro invariance will project out many of the c.

using standard notation, we will set  =  for  = 0, . . . , p (neuman/longnitudinal

directions) and  =  for  = p + 1, . . . , 9 (dirichlet/transverse conditions).

the well known solution is

|bi = n epn

where m = (m s)  so(1, 9) is the matrix formed from the electromagnetic elds

and lorentz boosts and rotations, c; and xing the value of p by choosing the  such

that

s = (, ij)

(4)

where ,  label the neumann directions and i, j label dirichlet directions. the advantage

of this notation is that the action of tduality alters s by exchanging signs, but leaves
the form of m invariant1.

is the closed string propagator used for calculating the amplitude hb2||b1i. a = 1 for

the bosonic string. for superstrings we have an s = 1/2 and ar = 0.

for superstrings we include fermions so that

|bi = |bibosonic|bif ermionic

the bosonic conditions remain unchanged. the fermionic ones are given by

(  m ) |bi = 0

(6)

(7)

for the non-zero modes the matrix m is the same as the bosonic case and the fermion

sections of the boundary state are given by

|b, irr = exp(ixr=0

(9)

the matrix m has some useful properties:

in the generic case with all possible

lorentz transformations applied and electromagnetic elds turned on, it sits in the group

so(1, 9). however, for various combinations, these transformations and elds can be used

1though it does alter the interpretation of the components of m so that velocities  electiric elds

and rotations  magnetic elds under the action of t-duality.

3

to break it into a product of so(1, k) with other so subgroups, of both even and odd

dimension. eectively this means that we can rewrite m in a block diagonal form based

on this subgroup structure. in particular one can group all the space dimensions for which

there is a boost or electric eld into the so(1, k) subgroup, ignoring the action of the

matrix s [8].

a second property of m is that the so(1, 9) normalizing factor is 1/ det(g + f ) 

1/ det(c), the inverse of square of the borninfeld action. if m can be reduced to a

block diagonal form, then det(c) can be rewritten as qk det(c k

), where k labels the
individual subgroups. this is useful for simplifying the handling the zero modes in the

presence of elds and transformations.

2.1 zero modes

in the presence of a nontrivial matrix m, care needs to be taken with how it modies

the vacuum properties. the simplest way to approach this to dene the generators of m:

j  = l + e + k

where

l = qp  qp

in ten dimensions there are no momentum or winding mode contributions to the bosonic

this can be easily shown to recover the pure lorentz boost solution of [9] by noting that
q in the longnitudinal direction is identically zero2. this works independently of how we

structure m.

since m  1/ det(c) then it follows n  1/qdet(c). the properties of delta

functions allow us to extract this to obtain the correct borninfeld term for the dbrane:

the product terms not included in the determinants are the nonzero mode ghost and

superghost contributions, while the  sign depends on whether we are dealing with a

brane - brane or brane - antibrane conguration.

using the character properties of untwisted ane lie algebras [19] this can be rewritten

in terms of theta functions:

1,1(zj|q)

where the fi(q) here are the ghost and superghost contributions; and the e2zj are the
parameters of m2mt

1 . for example, when dealing with a lorentz boost then the cor-
responding zj is the rapidity. if m1 = m2 then, by the so(1, 9) symmetry inherent in
these, mmt = i and the standard results in terms of the fi functions are recovered.

there is no need to distinguish between the nn, dd and nd modes since these are

incorporated via the presence of s in m.

as noted in [13, 16], the inclusion of a nonzero odd ramond spin structure in the

amplitude requires not only pairing up of the coordinates but that at least one of the

7

coordinates is properly inserted, say the 5th pair, i.e. there are no transformations or

elds turned on for this pair of directions. this technical point is highly signicant as it

means that at least one of the set of  functions simplies to cancel out the ghost and

superghost modes. similarly, when considering branes at angles to each other there are

only four independant nontrivial angles to be considered, so again there is simplication

which cancels the ghost modes. in all known examples of nonzero odd spin structure to

date there seems to be such mechanisms at work to provide these cancellations. it is the

presence of the ghost modes which stop the odd rr sector from disappearing altogether.

in terms of m1mt

2 this requires there to exist at least one trivial subgroup, i2, of so(1, 9).
if a second zj is also zero then this is no longer true and the contribution vanishes.

nevertheless, in the approach taken in this paper this can be seen as the exception rather

than the rule, so from now on we assume that at four of the zj are non-zero. the resulting

amplitude is

ns  r =

yj=1

0,1(zj|q)
1,1(zj|q)

1,0(zj|q)
1,1(zj|q)



1,1(zj|q)
1,1(zj|q)

4

yj=1

(32)

this is much more useful as the majority of known theta function identities are of

order 4.

before we examine the supersymmetry of these congurations we need to deal with

several issues arising out of the contribution to the amplitude of the rr zero modes.

3.1 regularization of fermion zero modes

so far we have implicitly allowed two dbranes of arbitary dimensions to interact. how-

ever, a naive examination of the normalization of the rr zero modes shows that the only

congurations permitted are where the number of mixed nd boundary conditions, , are

equal to 0 or 8 [18]. a more sophisticated approach to this problems requires the use of

the regularization technique introduced in [14] and developed for dbranes in [12], where

rr zero modes and superghost modes are dealt with together. this technique has been

used to show the existence of the important  = 8 solutions and also  = 6 solutions [17].

8

to get a more general set of solutions is not trivial as the regularization technique re-

quires the appropriate pairing up of dimensions. in the literature to date this pairing has

been intuitive, based on the natural so(2) subgroup formation present in the matrices

m being chosen. in these m is already diagonal and as a result there is no mixing of n

and d directions to break the so(2) substructures. these so(2) subgroups are dierent

in origin from the ones that are required to cancel the ghost modes and in the generic

conguration it is not possible to identify them.

if m1mt

down as the pairing can no longer simply be mapped from m1mt

2 has no natural so(2) substructures, then the intuitive argument breaks
2 to the spacetime.
the resolution to problem is to choose a pairing based on the ane so(1, 9) parameters

zj appearing in the nonzero mode contributions to the amplitude. that is, choose a

spacetime basis whereby each zj also labels a pair of dimensions aj = (aj1, aj2).
this pairing that the fermion number operators, nj = aj1 aj2 are now constructed as
outlined in [12]. in this way the overall structure of the conguration, encoded in m1mt
2 ,

it is

is utilized as opposed to the structure of the individual branes. hence

the regularizing factor used is r(x) = x2(f0+g0) in the limit x  1; f0 and g0 are the

fermion and superghost number operators respectively. thus we have

since there are always multiples of two s in the expression,  is always even, keeping in
line with the dbranes allowed under the gso projection4. the expression looks similar

to the one derived for a static brane with all elds turned o, but it is important that 

is not confused with  though in some cases it is possible to identify the two.

more signicant in these calculations is whether the elds/transformations are applied

or not, as opposed to their actual values. as there are contributions of s in sets of two

and four, one can have  = 0, 2, 4 for brane - brane systems and  = 8, 6, 4 for brane -

antibrane systems. only for  = 4 does it seem possible to have both brane - brane and

brane - antibrane systems. it was noted in the appendix of [18] that one can perform a

rotation of a brane through  in a plane so that it becomes an antibrane. this rotation
is however a lorentz transformation, so is a specic case of above and the change in m()

needs to be taken into account.

4 supersymmetry

order 4 identities for theta functions come from the so called riemanns theta identities.

the generic derivation for these starts with an integer valued matrix, a, satisfying

at a = m2in ; m, n  z

applied to theta functions we obtain the general rule

where

(43)

(44)

4the + sign is symbolic as the two expressions will have dierent constants coming from m1mt

2 and

there are potentially many such expressions in the amplitude.

11

the importance of this is that 1,1(0) = 0, and this is the only a,b for which this is

true. returning to the equation dening the identity, the set of solutions giving this is

determined by putting each one of the vi = aijuj equal to zero.

when the amplitude vanishes a fraction of the supersymmetry is preserved. the

corollary is that when it is not satised we are dealing with a system with completely

broken supersymmetry. we also have to take into account that there are special values

of the zj which can also give non-zero supersymmetric solutions.

for a given system of two interacting branes, if one of the dening equations for vi

holds such that

4

vizi = 0

(46)

xi=1

substituting in for  directly we recover by denition a,b, a, b = 0, 1 so it is clear that

we can map the expression for ns  r to an appropriate matrix a. as there are plus

and minus signs in ns  r we must rst perform modular transformations and multiply

by appropriate terms to obtain an exact correlation. in the above case this has already

been performed and is given as equation r5 on page 18 of [20]; i.e., replace one of the

ui by ui +  + 1 and multiply by exp(i + 2iui). the nal result for a brane  brane

conguration, is

n

ns  r =

1,1(vi)

(45)

yi=1

then the fraction of supersymmetry preserved is 1/16 as a killing spinor can survive [10].

the rule is as follows:

satised then the fraction of supersymmetry preserved is k/16. this allows us to recover

if the zi are such that k equations of the form p vizi = 0 are

preserved supersymmetries up to 1/4. it is not possible to identify each fraction preserved

with a particular interaction between the branes, as the vanishing of the sum is over all

parameters zj.

to get higher fractions requires the special case setting all zi = 0, which preserves

1/2 of the supersymmetries. this corresponds to when the branes are parallel, move with

the same velocity and have identical elds so that the bps condition, m1mt

2 = i, is

recovered.

12

the solution given in [10] corresponds to the matrix a used in deriving the original

riemann theta identities which can be found in [20]. explicitly:

a =

which translates into the supersymmetry preserving conditions

za + zb + zc + zd = 0

za + zb  zc  zd = 0

za  zb + zc  zd = 0

za  zb  zc + zd = 0

(47)

(48)

these have been classied according to the amount of supersymmetry they preserve in
[10] in terms of rotated brane angles5, however utilizing t-duality they can equivalently

considered as turning on electricmagnetic elds.

a complete classication of supersymmetries for these type of congurations is thus

obtained by determining all the possible a. given a set of integers {vi} for which (46)

holds and also satisfy

i = m2
v2

4

xi=1

(49)

as follows from (42), the existance of {vi} is a necessary condition for the preservation

of some supersymmetry. for a sucient condition one needs to construct the full integer

matrix a or at least show that it exists, though (46) need not hold for all rows.

if no supersymmetry is preserved then we can still use the existence of the riemann

theta identities to simplify ns  r to

5note that these solutions are all mod .

m

4

yi=1"1,1((az)i)
1,1(zi) #

(50)

13

for the brane - antibrane case the above analysis does not hold as there is no sub-

stitution zj  zj + a + b which will give the correct set of signs. however, if we rewrite,

symbolically, the amplitude as

[ns(+) + ns() + r(+) + r()]  2r()

(51)

and if some supersymmetry is preserved then the term in square brackets vanishes and

we are left with an amplitude proportional to

4

1,1(zi)#
yi=1"1,1(zi)

(52)

which cancels to unity. this implies that there is the possibility for the creation of a

fundamental string in these congurations as the branes cross through each other adi-

abatically [11, 18] as long as some supersymmetry holds. the created string will have

properties as dened by the zj.

5 conclusion

in this paper we have shown how riemann theta identies can be used to classify the

preserved supersymmetry of arbitary congurations of d-branes with nonvanishing odd

spin structure. this has been done by using the identities to map the amplitudes to

integer matrices a. any supersymmetric conguration must be such that a matrix a can

be constructed which satises a simple but nontrivial equation. as the amplitudes used

are invariant under tduality the results are quite general and can be applied to a variety

of dierent congurations since it is the form of the amplitude that is signicant, not how

it was constructed.

we have also derived a general rule for when the congurations are permitted to

have a rr sector, which is intimately connected to the relative conguration of elds and

transformations between the interacting branes encoded in m1mt

2 . again this constraint
is related to the overall conguration between the branes and not to them individually.

this constraint will also result in restrictions on the types of bound states permitted.

14

though the cancellation of ghosts and superghosts allow solutions to be constructed,

the physical understanding of this is nontrivial. for instance, d0branes would expect

to have ve non-zero zj, permitted. the coordinate pair that cancels the ghosts do not

have to be in the light cone directions, which would imply that this feature is indepen-

dant of whether we use light cone or covariant quantization, i.e. the fact the d0brane is

dened in term of a superstring is not signicant in this case. what controls the presence

of supersymmetry is the subgroup properties of m1mt

2 which is still required to have a
trivial so(2) subgroup for any supersymmetry to be preserved at all. moreover, the sub-

group properties are generically independant of the subgroup properties of the constituent

matrices m. however, it is not obvious how this can generically be related directly the
rules governing which p  p congurations are permitted, if at all.

interestingly there does not appear to exist any 5  5 matrix satisfying the conditions

for a, and thus no corresponding order 5 riemann theta identities which would point

towards supersymmetry preserving solutions for ve nonzero zj.
