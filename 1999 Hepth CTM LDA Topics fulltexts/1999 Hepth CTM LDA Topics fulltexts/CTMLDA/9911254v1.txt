abstract

two problems relative to the electromagnetic coupling of dun-kemmer-petiau

(dkp) theory are discussed: the presence of an anomalous term in the hamil-

tonian form of the theory and the apparent dierence between the interaction

terms in dkp and klein-gordon (kg) lagrangians. for this, we rst discuss the

behavior of dkp eld and its physical components under gauge transformations.

from this analysis, we can show that these problems simply do not exist if one

correctly analyses the physical components of dkp eld.

1 introduction

the dun-kemmer-petiau (dkp) equation is a rst order relativistic wave equa-

tion for spin 0 and 1 bosons [1, 2, 3], similar to dirac equation. the historical

development of this theory, among others, until the 70s can be found in reference

[4]. more recently there have been an increasing interest in dkp theory, specif-

ically it has been applied to qcd (large and short distances) by gribov [5], to

covariant hamiltonian dinamics by kanatchikov [6] and have been generalized to

curved space-time by redkov [7] and lunardi et al [8].

it is well known that for free elds there is a perfect equivalence between dkp

equation and klein-gordon (kg) and proca equations but, when interaction

with electromagnetic eld through minimal coupling is present, doubts about

this equivalence arise. this is because when one pass to the hamiltonian form

(schrodinger like) or to a second order kg like wave equation an anomalous term

that does not posses a clear physical interpretation appears [2]. moreover, it was

argued that, when applied to the lagrangian density for the spin 0 version of

dkp theory, the minimal coupling seems to provide an interaction term linear in

the potential vector a, a dierent result from the quadratic term in a found

when starting with the kg lagrangian.

our intention in this paper is to show that the problem in the physical in-

terpretation of dkp theory and the contradiction between it and kg theory are

only apparent and can be fully elucidated by a correct interpretation of the phys-

ical meaning of the dkp wave function  and the correct application of gauge

invariance principle.

for this, we will dedicate section 2 to mention some basic results in dkp free

eld theory, mainly those relative to the obtainment and interpretation of the

physical components of dkp eld. for further details we suggest the reader to

3

original works [1, 2] or classic textbooks [9, 10]. next, in section 3, we analyse

the apparent discrepancy between kg and dkp theories when electromagnetic

interaction comes to play. this discrepancy is shown to be caused by the use

of an expression for the dkp eld, in terms of its physical components, that is

incompatible with the gauge invariance. once we construct a correct expression

for the dkp eld we nd that there is a perfect agreement.

in section 4 we show that the question of the apparently problematic term

lacking physical interpretation can be shown to be not relevant by noticing that

it disappears when we analyse the physical components of the dkp eld .

this fact has already been shown by nowakowski [11] at classical level and more

recently by fainberg and pimentel [12] at classical and quantum level too. but

in this paper we adopt a dierent approach to reduce the wave function  to its

physical components using the projectors on the spin 0 and spin 1 sectors of dkp

theory [9] in order to make more clear, in our opinion, the origin of this physical

interpretation. finally, in section 5, we make some concluding remarks.

2 the free eld theory

the dkp equation is given by

(i  m)  = 0,

where the matrices  obey the algebraic relations

 +  =  + ,

(1)

(2)

being  the metric tensor of minkowski space-time with signature (+  ).
the matrices  have 2 non trivial irreducible representations: a 5 degree one,

corresponding to spin 0 particles, and a 10 degree one, corresponding to spin 1

particles. from the algebraic relation above we can also obtain (no summation

4

on repeated indexes)

()3 = ,

so that we can dene the matrices

that satisfy

 = 2 ()2   (no summation)

()2 = 1,    = 0,
 +  = 0 ( 6= ) ,

 =  =  (no summation) .

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

with these results we can write the lagrangian density for dkp free eld as

where  is dened as

l =

i
2

   m,

 = 0.

(8)

(9)

moreover, we can choose 0 to be hermitian and i anti-hermitian so that the

equation for  can also be easily obtained by applying hermitian conjugation to

equation (1).

multiplying the dkp equation by  from left we can nd [2]

 = 

and contracting this result with  we have

(cid:3) + m2 = 0

(10)

(11)

so that each component of  satises kg equation, as expected for a relativistic

eld equation. summing equation (10) for  = 0 and dkp equation multiplied
from left by i0 we get a schrodinger like hamiltonian form wave equation

5

it = h

where

under a lorentz transformation x = 

x we have

h = i(cid:2)i, 0(cid:3) i + m0.

   = u () ,
u1u = 
,

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

and for innitesimal transformations  =  +  ( = ) we obtain
[9]

u = 1 +

1
2

s, s = [, ] .

(16)

the spin 0 and spin 1 sectors of the theory can be selected from a general

representation of  matrices through a set of operators, as shown in reference

[9]. for the spin 0 sector the operators are

p = (cid:0)0(cid:1)2(cid:0)1(cid:1)2(cid:0)2(cid:1)2(cid:0)3(cid:1)2 ,

which satises p 2 = p , and

p  = p .

it can be shown that

p  = p , p s = 0,

(17)

(18)

(19)

and, as consequence, under innitesimal lorentz transformations (16) we have

p u = p ,

(20)

so that p  transforms as a (pseudo)scalar. similarly

p u = p  + 

p ,

showing that p  transforms like a (pseudo)vector.

applying these operators to dkp equation (1) we have

 (p ) =

m
i

p ,

p  =

i
m

 (p ) ,

and

which combined provide

6

(21)

(22)

(23)

 (p ) + m2 (p ) = (cid:3) (p ) + m2 (p ) = 0.

(24)

these results show that all elements of the column matrix p  are scalar

elds of mass m obeying kg equation while the elements of p  are i

m times the
derivative with respect to x of the corresponding elements of p . then, acting

p upon  selects the spin 0 sector of dkp theory, making explicitly clear that it

describes a scalar particle.

now, for the spin 1 sector we have as operators

r = 


(1)2 (2)2 (3)2 0;  6= 0

 (1)2 (2)2 (3)2(cid:16)1  (0)2(cid:17) ;  = 0

;

which can be written compactly as

and

r = (cid:0)1(cid:1)2(cid:0)2(cid:1)2(cid:0)3(cid:1)2(cid:2)0  0(cid:3) ;

r = r.

(25)

(26)

(27)

from these denitions we have the following properties

r = r,

r = r  r,
rs = r  r,

rs = r  r  r + r.

7

(28)

(29)

(30)

(31)

these results allow us to show that under innitesimal lorentz transforma-

tions we have

ru = r + 

r,

(32)

so we can see that r transforms like a (pseudo)vector while r transforms

like a (pseudo)tensor since

ru = r + 

r + 

r.

the application of these operators to dkp equation results in

and

where

 (r) =

m
i

r,

r = 

i
m

u ,

u  = r  r

(33)

(34)

(35)

(36)

is the strength tensor of the massive vector eld r. combined, these results

provide

 (cid:18)

i
m

u (cid:19) =

m
i

r

u  + m2r = 0,

(37)

(38)

8

(39)

or equivalently

(cid:0)(cid:3) + m2(cid:1) r = 0; r = 0.

so, all elements of the column matrix r are components vector elds of

mass m obeying proca equation; being the elements of r equal to i

m times
the eld strength tensor of the vector eld of which the corresponding elements of

r are components. so, similarly to the spin 0 case, this procedure selects the

spin 1 content of dkp theory, making explicitly clear that it describes a massive

vectorial particle.

moreover, for the spin 0 case, we can choose a 5 degree irreducible represen-

tation of the  matrices in such a way that

p  = p

(43)

(44)

(45)

(46)

(47)

here we will call expression (46) for  the physical form of dkp eld. if

we use this representation for the  matrices, together with the physical form of

, in dkp lagrangian (8) we get

l = 

1
2

((cid:3) + (cid:3))  m2,

(48)

which can be integrated by parts giving as result, except by a four-divergence

term, the usual kg lagrangian

l =   m2.

(49)

similarly, for the case of spin 1 particles, a 10 degree irreducible representation

of the matrices can be found such that the rst four components of the eld 

10

are the components of a four vector b, being selected by r. the other 6

components of  are the 6 independent components of the strength tensor of b.

these components are selected by r so that when we apply these operators to

equation (38) it becomes the proca equation for the eld b. anyway, we will

not make use of this specic representation so we just mention this possibility

here for the sake of completness without working out the complete calculations.

3 local gauge invariance and the interaction la-

grangian

when one interacts dkp eld with electromagnetic eld, a close attention must

be taken when interpreting the physical content of the theory. after performing

the minimal coupling to the dkp lagrangian we obtain as an interaction term

li = ea,

(50)

so that, to regain the interaction term in kg theory, one may be tempted to use

the expression (46) for  in the interaction term above, getting as result

li = iea (   () ) ,

(51)

that is, a linear term dierent from the quadratic term obtained from kg la-

grangian. this result gave rise to the interpretation that dkp and kg theories

were equivalent only in the free eld case. our intention here is to show that this

dierence arises from the incorrect use of the physical form of dkp eld (46) in a

situation where it is no longer valid, since it was obtained for free elds, which

is not the case anymore.

first of all, we can easily see that expression (46) for the physical form is

incompatible with gauge invariance. this comes from the fact that, under local

gauge transformations, we must have

  = eie(x);   = eie(x),

11

(52)

for dkp and kg elds, respectively. but using the transformation property of

 in the expression (46) for the physical form results in

= 


im
m


 = 


im (cid:0)ieeie(x) (x) + eie(x)(cid:1)

eie(x)m


 6= eie(x),

(53)

so that it becomes obvious that the expression obtained in the free eld case is

no longer valid.

the solution to this problem would be simply change the physical form of 

from that given by equation (46) to

 = 


imd
m


 ,

(54)

where d =   iea, which obviously transforms as necessary to keep the
compatibility between both transformations in equation (52). more than this, we

can easily show that this change in the expression for the physical form arises

naturally when we analyse dkp lagrangian with minimal coupling, showing

explicitly that the direct application of equation (46) in this case is a mistake.

indeed, starting with the dkp lagrangian (8) we perform the minimal coupling

obtaining as result

or

l =

i

2 (cid:0)d  d(cid:0)(cid:1) (cid:1)  m,

l =

i
2

   m + ea,

(55)

(56)

and from these we obtain the minimally coupled dkp equation

applying the operators p and p  we obtain

(id  m)  = 0.

and

so that

d (p ) =

m
i

p 

p  =

i
m

d (p ) ,

dd (p ) + m2 (p ) = 0.

12

(57)

(58)

(59)

(60)

this shows that all elements of the column matrix p  are scalar elds of mass

m obeying kg equation with minimal coupling, while the elements of p  are i
m

times the covariant derivatives of the corresponding elements of p . following

exactly the same steps and using the same representation for the matrices  used

to obtain expression (46) in the free eld case, we see that the correct physical

form for  when we have electromagnetic interaction is given by equation (54).

besides that, we have

p  = 


041
m


 , p  =

i
m




041
d


 , dd + m2 = 0.

(61)

furthermore, to regain kg interaction lagrangian it is not enough to use the

expression (54) for  in the dkp interaction term (50), we must consider the

whole dkp lagrangian since now  has covariant derivatives in its components

and, consequently, spread the interaction terms throughout the whole dkp

lagrangian. so, we must substitute expression (54) in the complete minimally

coupled dkp lagrangian given by expression (55) or (56). this results in

l = 

1

2 (cid:0)d + d(cid:1)+ie

1
2

a (  )+e2aam2,
(62)

13

l =

1

2 (cid:0)d + d(cid:1) + ie

1
2

a (  ) + e2aa m2,
(63)

l =  + iea (  ) + e2aa  m2,

(64)

where an integration by parts was performed in the rst term of equation (62).

this is exactly the usual kg lagrangian with minimal coupling so that we obtain

the correct interaction term

li = iea (  ) + e2aa.

(65)

thus we see that, using the correct physical form for the dkp eld  in the

minimal coupling case, we can recover the kg lagrangian with the correct min-

imal coupling interaction term. consequently, the equivalence of these theories

is kept when electromagnetic interaction comes to play. the apparent dierence

reported in literature comes from the use of a physical form for the dkp eld,

obtained in the free case, that is no longer valid with the presence of the electro-

magnetic eld and is incompatible with the requirement of local gauge invariance.

4 the physical components and the anomalous

terms

now we will analyse the presence of an apparently anomalous term lacking phys-

ical interpretation in hamiltonian and second order forms of minimally coupled

dkp theory. these forms are obtained starting from the dkp equation with

minimal coupling, equation (57), and contracting from the left with d,

which results in

idd  md = 0.

(66)

14

after some algebraic calculation the above expression reduces to

d = d +

e
2m

f ( + ) ,

(67)

where the relation [d, d] = ief was used. making  = 0 in this last
expression we have

d0 (cid:0)0(cid:1)2

d0  i0di 

e
2m

f(cid:0)0 + 0(cid:1)  = 0,

while multiplying equation (57) from left by i0 results in
(cid:0)0(cid:1)2 d0 + 0idi + im0 = 0.

(68)

(69)

then, summing these equations we get the hamiltonian (schrodinger like)

form of dkp wave equation

it = h,

where

h = i(cid:2)i, 0(cid:3) di + i

e
2m

f(cid:0)0 + 0(cid:1)  ea0 + m0.

(70)

(71)

finally, contracting equation (67) with d we get as result a second order

wave equation

dd + m2 

i
2

efs 

e
2m

( + ) d (f) = 0.

(72)

the anomalous term is the one proportional to e/2m in equations (67) and

(72) and in hamiltonian (71). this denomination is due to the fact, already

noticed by kemmer in his original work [2], that it has no apparent physical

interpretation, contrary to the others terms in these equations, which have physi-

cal interpretations analogous to similar terms obtained when working with dirac

equation.

15

recently nowakowski [11] settled the question by showing that the above

mentioned term has no physical meaning and simply disapears when one works

with the physical components of the dkp eld. this is done by the use a specic
choice of the 10  10 and 5  5 representations of dkp algebra. our intention
here is to show that this result can be easily obtained in any representation of

the algebra (it is not even necessary to be an irreducible one) through the use of

the operators, dened in section 2, that select the spin 0 and spin 1 sectors of

the theory from any choice of the  matrices satisfying dkp algebra.

first, for the case of the spin 0 sector of the theory, we can apply the operator

p dened by equation (17) to the second order equation (72) obtaining

dd (p ) + m2 (p ) 

i
2

efp s 

e
2m

p ( + ) d (f) = 0

dd (p ) + m2 (p ) 

e
2m

(p  + p ) d (f) = 0

dd (p ) + m2 (p ) = 0,

(73)

(74)

(75)

where we have used equations (18) and (19). so we see that when we select the

spin 0 sector p  the anomalous term vanishes. more than this, the spin-eld

interaction term [2] fs also vanishes, as it should be for a scalar eld. when

applying p  to this equation we get as result the covariant derivative d of kg

equation (75), but we must remember that the relations between p and p  are

now given by equations (58) and (59) and not by equations (22) and (23) obtained

for the free eld case. analogously, when using p and p  on equations (67) and

(70) we obtain trivial equalities or regain kg equation (75).

moreover, he shows that the solutions of the second order equation (72) will not always be

solutions of the rst order dkp equation. so, it is not a good analog to diracs second order

equation. he also shows that (72) is just one among a class of second order equations that can

be obtained from dkp equation.

now, in order to analyse the spin 1 sector, we must derive the relation between

r and r in the presence of minimal coupling, in the same way that we have

done in the previous section with the operators p and p . so, we apply those

operators to the dkp equation with minimal coupling, equation (57), obtaining

16

and

where

d (r) =

m
i

(r) ,

(r) = 

i
m

u i,

u i = dr  dr,

(76)

(77)

(78)

is the covariant stress tensor of the massive vector eld r interacting minimally

with electromagnetic eld. this tensor can be written explicitly as

u i = u   ie (ar  ar) .

(79)

it is interesting to mention that combining these results we have the minimally

coupled proca equation

d(cid:0)u i(cid:1) + m2 (r) = 0.

now, when we apply the operator r to equation (72) we get

ddr + m2r 


i
efrs
2
e

2m (cid:0)r + r(cid:1) d (f) = 0,

(80)

(81)

which can be shown to reduce, after some algebraic manipulation, to the min-

imally coupled proca equation (80). when we apply the operator r to the

second order equation (72) we simply regain the u i denition, equation (79).

17

similar results follow to the others equations: we regain denitions or get

trivial identities. as example, applying r to equation (67) will result in

dr =

ie
2m2 fu i,

(82)

where f is the usual stress tensor for electromagnetic eld a. but this result

can be obtained directly from the covariant derivative of proca equation (80).

the important result is that when we select the physical components of dkp

eld  the anomalous term is eliminated, so it has no physical meaning. and,

as mentioned before, this result is not dependent upon a specic choice of the 

matrices nor the degree of the representation, being quite general.

5 conclusions and comments

in this work we discussed two points relative to the minimal electromagnetic

coupling in dkp theory that is not usually understood in literature correctly.

first we showed that a reported dierence between the interaction term for

scalar bosons in spin 0 dkp theory and kg theory does not exist. this apparent

dierence was showed to be caused by the incorrect use of an expression for the

physical form of dkp eld that is valid only in the free eld case, not in the

minimally coupled case. when the correct physical form of  in the presence of

electromagnetic interaction is used, we nd no dierence between the interaction

terms in both theories. we have also shown that the gauge invariance principle

shows clearly the origin of the problem since the free eld physical form of  is

incompatible with gauge invariance: changing the expression for physical form is

necessary to keep gauge invariance. moreover, the correct expression was easily

obtained using dkp lagrangian with minimal coupling, the minimally coupled

dkp equation, the projectors of the physical components and a convenient choice

18

of  matrices (the same used in the free eld case).

in addition we showed that the apparently anomalous term in second order

and hamiltonian forms of dkp equation disappears when we select the physical

components of dkp eld, so that this term has no physical meaning. this con-

clusion is exactly the same presented by nowakowski [11] but, it seems to us, was

obtained here in a more clear and becoming way. furthermore, the use of the

operators that select the spin 0 and 1 sectors of the theory do not demand the

choice of an specic representation of the  matrices. finally, it is also interest-

ing to notice that, when we project the physical components of dkp eld, the

second order equation (72) is reduced to the well known second order equations

for scalar and vector elds, i.e. klein-gordon and proca equations.
