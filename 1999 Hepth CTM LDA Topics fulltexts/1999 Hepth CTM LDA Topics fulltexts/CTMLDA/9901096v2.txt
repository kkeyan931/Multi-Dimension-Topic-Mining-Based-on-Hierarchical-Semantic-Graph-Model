the regularity of static axially symmetric solutions in su (2) yang-mills-dilaton theory is exam-
ined. we show that the solutions obtained previously within a singular ansatz for the non-abelian
gauge eld can be gauge transformed into a regular form. the local form of the gauge transforma-
tion is given on the singular axis and at the origin.

i. introduction

static spherically symmetric solutions in non-abelian gauge theories have been investigated for a long time. the
su (2) monopoles in the georgi-glashow model [1] and in extended models [2], as well as the sphalerons in the
weinberg-salam model at vanishing mixing angle [3], in yang-mills-dilaton [4], einstein-yang-mills [5] and einstein-
yang-mills-dilaton [6] theory are some examples. all these solutions are localized in space and possess nite energy
and nite energy density.

besides the static spherically symmetric solutions there exist solutions with axial symmetry only, which also are
localized in space and possess nite energy and nite energy density. in the georgi-glashow model these are su (2)
multi-monopole solutions investigated numerically in the self-dual limit by rebbi and rossi [7] and later analytically
by forgacs, horvarth and palla [8] and others [9]. a numerical study of the axially symmetric su (2) multi-monopole
solutions in the non self-dual case has been done recently in ref. [10] for the georgi-glashow model and in ref. [11] for
the extended monopole model. in the weinberg-salam model the sphaleron at nite mixing angle [12], the sphaleron
anti-sphaleron solution [13] and the multi-sphalerons [14] possess axial symmetry only. the same holds for the su (2)
multi-sphalerons in yang-mills-dilaton [15], einstein-yang-mills and einstein-yang-mills-dilaton [1619] theories.

for the construction of static axially symmetric solutions it is convenient to use appropriate ansatze for the gauge
potential and the higgs eld, if present. for the multimonopoles, forgacs et al. [8] use the static axially symmetric
su (2) ansatz of manton [20], which is inspired by an ansatz of witten [21]. the ansatz of rebbi and rossi [7]
generalizes the ansatz of manton [20] for winding number |n| > 1, corresponding to the magnetic charge in the georgi-
glashow model. as the winding number characterizes non-trivial maps between two two-dimensional spheres, it also
characterizes topologically dierent sectors in the conguration space of the theory. this ansatz is parameterized by
four functions for the gauge potential and two functions for the higgs eld. this ansatz possesses a residual abelian
gauge degree of freedom, which has to be xed by a gauge constraint. the ansatz is singular in the sense that it is a
priori not well dened on the symmetry axis and at the origin. rebbi and rossi discuss the corresponding regularity
conditions to be imposed on the functions parameterizing the ansatz [7].

the ansatze used in [10,11,1419] derive from the ansatz of rebbi and rossi [7]. boundary conditions have been
imposed on the functions to ensure a nite energy density, but regularity conditions on the symmetry axis and at the
origin have not been imposed, to ensure a well dened gauge potential. thus, the solutions are given in a singular
form and one may question whether the solutions themselves are regular for winding number |n| > 1. on the other
hand, one should keep in mind, that the gauge potential is a gauge variant quantity and all physical conclusions
concern only gauge invariant quantities. any regular gauge potential can be gauge transformed into a singular gauge
potential. for example, the gauge potential of the t hooft-polyakov monopole becomes singular in the unitary gauge,
see e. g. [22]. however, it is not true that any singular gauge potential can be gauge transformed into a regular one. if
the gauge potential is somewhere singular the eld strength tensor must be calculated carefully in order not to loose
contributions from the singular part of the gauge potential, which are overlooked easily by naive calculation. once
it is shown, that the naive calculation of the eld strength tensor gives the correct result, one can nd the equation
of motion from the action principle. there is no need for a globally regular gauge potential, as long as for any point
there exist a neighborhood on which a regular gauge potential can be dened and gauge potentials on intersections
of neighborhoods can be transformed into each other by regular gauge transformations. the dirac monopole e. g.,
possesses singularities along the negative z-axis, which can be removed locally by a gauge transformation, but the
singularity at the origin persists - it represents a physical quantity, the magnetic point charge.

turning back to the non-abelian gauge elds, we notice, that in case no point-like charges are expected to occur,
gauge transformations may exist, which transform locally the singular gauge potentials of the solutions constructed
in [10,11,1419] into regular gauge potentials. in general such gauge transformations are singular themselves. the
important point is that these singularities of the gauge transformations should not be too strong to produce additional
contributions to the eld strength tensor or gauge invariant quantities.

in this paper we will consider the multisphalerons in yang-mills-dilaton theory [15] and give the local gauge

transformations leading to a regular gauge potential.

the paper is organized as follows. in section ii we will present the static axially symmetric ansatz of the gauge
potential, derive the eld strength tensor and the lagrange density of the yang-mills-dilaton theory as well as
the dierential equations for the gauge eld functions and the dilaton function. the regularity conditions are also
discussed. in section iii the local form of the gauge transformation is derived along the symmetry axis and at the
origin. the discussion and conclusions are given in section iv.

ii. static axially symmetric ansatz

the static axially symmetric ansatz [19] for the su(2) valued gauge potential a = adx is given in spherical
coordinates r, ,  by

ar =

where the su(2) matrices  n

 ,  = , , r,  are dened in terms of the pauli matrices 1, 2, 3 by

(1)

 n
 = cos(n)1 + sin(n)2 ,
 n
 =  sin(n)1 + cos(n)2 ,
 n
r = sin  n
 n
 = cos  n

 + cos 3 ,
  sin 3 .

here the integer n denotes the winding number. as symmetry axis we have chosen the z-axis. the functions hi,
i = 1, . . . , 4 depend on the variables r and  only, hi(~r) = hi(r, ). the functions

f3 = sin h3 + cos (1  h4) ,
f4 = cos h3  sin (1  h4)

have been dened for later convenience. in the following a0 will be zero in all gauges and we will consider the spatial
components of the gauge potential only. we x the gauge coupling constant to g = 1.

from the requirement of nite energy density, see later eq. (3), we nd that on the z-axis the functions h1 and h3
have to vanish, while the functions h2 and h4 have to be equal to each other, h2(r,  = 0) = h4(r,  = 0) = f (r),
whereas at the origin the functions h1 and h3 take the value zero, while the functions h2 and h4 take the value 1.
the ansatz eq. (1) is singular in the sense that it is not well dened on the z-axis and the ori-
gin. these singularities originate from the functions sin(n) and cos(n), which are not well dened at
in order to exhibit the singularities more clearly we turn to cartesian coordinates
(x, y, z) = (r sin  cos , r sin  sin , r cos ) = ( cos ,  sin , z). in these coordinates the components of the gauge
potential become

turning to the calculation of the eld strength tensor

f = a  a + i [a, a] ,

partial dierentiation has to be carried out carefully. however, taking into account the behavior of the functions hi
on the z-axis, we see, that in the gauge potential eq. (2) terms like x
2 do not arise, which could lead to -functions

2 , y

along the z-axis, i. e. x( x
2 ) = 2(x)(y). this is in contrast to the dirac monopole, where the gauge
eld blows up near the negative z-axis and the eld strength tensor does pick up -functions [23], but this singular
part is an artifact [24,25].

similarly, at the origin no terms like x
consequently, it is straightforward to calculate the eld strength tensor with the ansatz eq. (2). the components

like the gauge potential, the eld strength tensor is not well dened on the z-axis and at the origin. however, the
lagrange density lf =  1
 ) = 2 .
in this article we consider yang-mills-dilaton theory [4,15], where the dilaton is a scalar eld (~r) which couples to

2 t r (f f ) is well dened due to the normalization of the  n

 matrices, t r( n

the yang-mills eld. the lagrange density l is given by

where  is the dilaton coupling constant.

for a static axially symmetric ansatz for the gauge eld, it is consistent to assume that the dilaton eld possesses

axial symmetry, too. thus we can consider the dilaton function (~r) as function of r and  only, (~r) = (r, ).

next we change to dimensionless variables, r  r2

obtain the dimensionless lagrange density

this system has to be solved subject to the boundary conditions,

these conditions follow from the requirement of nite energy density and symmetry considerations, see [17]. no
non-trivial explicit solutions of this boundary value problem are known. however, for winding number n  4 axially
symmetric solutions have been constructed numerically in [15] using a dierent parameterization of the ansatz.

for solutions of the dierential equations (4)-(8) the gauge potential eq. (2) is not well dened on the z-axis and
 ,  n
at the origin. regularity requires that in the gauge potential eq. (2) the coecients multiplying the matrices  n

contain at least a power |n|. let us denote the gauge eld functions of a regular gauge potential a by hi, etc. then
near the z-axis the following behavior for the functions hi is required

in the following section we will nd the local form of gauge transformations which lead exactly to the desired behavior
of the gauge eld functions, eqs. (10).

iii. gauge transformations

the gauge potential is a gauge variant quantity. let u (~r) be a su (2) valued function and a = adx a su(2)

valued gauge potential. the gauge transformed gauge potential a = adx is dened by

a = u au + idu u .

first assume there is a regular gauge potential a = a()

in this section the gauge degree of freedom will be used to transform the singular gauge potential into a regular one.

for small  the regular gauge potential behaves like a = a(z)

a  a = iuu + uh a, ui .

3 . under the as-
sumption stated above, we nd from the rst two equations that the ar and a components of the singular gauge
potential behave like a pure gauge for small , whereas the last two equations put constraints on the gauge transfor-
mation matrix u (~r). exploiting the residual abelian gauge degree of freedom of the ansatz, these constraints can be
solved by choosing a special form for the matrix u (~r),

(13)

(14)
(15)

(16)

the assumption, that there exist a gauge transformation which transforms a singular gauge potential into a regular
one of the same form, is very strong. however, with the dierential equations at hand it can be checked straightfor-
wardly whether the ar and a components of the gauge potential form a pure gauge for small . if this is the case,
then the gauge transformation function (r, ) can be found for small . in addition it has to be checked that the
same gauge transformation applied to the a component of the gauge potential also leads to a regular form.

we will proceed in the following way. at the z-axis we will expand the functions hi(r, ) and (r, ) in powers of
sin . the coecients will be functions of r only. we insert the expansion of the functions hi(r, ) and (r, ) into
the partial dierential equations and expand the right hand sides of eqs. (4)-(8) in powers of sin . for a solution of
the partial dierential equations the coecients in the expansion of the partial dierential equations have to vanish.
setting these coecients equal to zero results in a set of relations for the coecient functions of the expansion of the
functions hi(r, ) and (r, ). this does not determine the functions completely. however, it enables us to nd the
local form of gauge transformations which lead to a gauge transformed potential which is well dened on the z-axis.
in a similar way we will expand the functions hi(r, ) and (r, ) at the origin in powers of r sin  and r cos . the
coecients in the expansion of the functions are constants then. relations between these constants will be obtained,
again, by inserting the expansion of the functions into the dierential equations, expanding the expressions eqs. (4)-
(8) in powers of r sin  and r cos  and setting the coecients in this expansion equal to zero. from this analysis the
local form of a gauge transformation at the origin can be found, which again leads to a gauge transformed potential
which is well dened at the origin.

finally we will compare the gauge transformation at the origin with the gauge transformations near the z-axis for
small values of r. as a result we will nd, that the both local forms coincide in the region where both expansions
should hold.

because our main interest is the behavior of the gauge potential at the z-axis and at the origin, we will not exhibit

the expansion of the dilaton function in the following.

in this paper we will restrict to the case with winding number n = 2, 3, 4. the single steps in the calculations are
elementary but tedious and will be omitted. for winding number n = 3, 4 large expressions arise in the expansion at
the origin. these expressions are exhibited in the appendix.

a. gauge transformation at the z-axis

we start by examining the behavior of the functions hi near the positive z-axis. we will expand these functions
hi in terms of sin . from the equations of motion we will nd relations between the coecients which depend on r.

the expansions up to third order in  was obtained before in ref. [17] for the more general case of einstein-
including the coupling of axially symmetric yang-mills and dilaton elds to gravity

yang-mills-dilaton theory, i. e.
[16,17,19].

the expansions in sin  to third order, which are consistent with the boundary conditions eqs. (9), are given by

inserting (17) into the dierential equations (4)-(8) and expanding in terms of sin  the following relations between

h23 = rr h12 ,
h32 = 0 ,

h42 =

the functions h33(r) and h43(r) may also be expressed in terms of f (r), g(r), h12(r), h13(r) and other functions.
however these expressions look very complicated and their detailed structure is not needed in the following.

c. gauge transformation on the overlap

next we compare the gauge transformations (n)

the expansions of the functions hi(r, ) near the z-axis and near the origin we can determine the expansion of the
function f (r) at the origin and calculate the gauge transformation function (z)(r, ) for small values of r, . for
winding number n = 4 for example, we nd

(z) on the positive z-axis and (n)

the same expression can be obtained by expanding (4)
(o)(r, ), eq. (23), for small values of . thus both gauge
transformations coincide on the neighborhood where the expansion for small  and small r are comparable. the same
holds for winding number n = 2, 3.

similarly, the gauge transformation function on the negative z-axis can be compared with (n)

(o) (r, ). again the

both gauge transformations coincide where the expansions are comparable.

iv. discussion and conclusions

in this paper we have examined the question as to how static axially symmetric solutions of the yang-mills-dilaton
theory, given within a singular ansatz of the gauge potential, can be gauge transformed into regular form. we have
shown that the eld strength tensor can be calculated straightforwardly from the singular ansatz, if we impose the
condition of nite energy density on the gauge eld functions. although the eld strength tensor itself is not well
dened on the singular axis and the origin, the lagrange density is well dened in terms of the gauge eld functions.
consequently the equations of motion reduce to a boundary value problem for the gauge eld functions and the
dilaton function. from the analysis of this boundary value problem we found that the singular parts of the ar and a
components of the gauge potential behave like a pure gauge along the singular axis and at the origin. with suitable
local gauge transformations the non-regular parts have been gauged away. applying the same gauge transformation
to the a component of the singular gauge potential leads to a regular form, too. thus in total the gauge transformed
gauge potential is regular.

the gauge transformation itself is not well dened. however, it does not introduce new terms in the eld strength
tensor. it can be checked, that along the singular axis and at the origin the eld strength tensor f [ a], calculated
from the regular gauge transformed potential a, coincides with the gauge rotated eld strength tensor u f[a]u in
terms of the singular gauge potential a, provided the gauge eld functions are used in their local expansions, i. e. for
solutions of the boundary value problem.

14

the gauge transformation functions (n)

(o) are determined only in the vicinity of the z-axis or the origin,
respectively, and have to be considered as local gauge transformations. away form the z-axis or the origin the gauge
transformation matrices u(z), u(o) might approach unity suciently fast. then the gauge transformed functions hi
behave like the original functions hi except in a region near the z-axis or the origin.

(z) , (n)

the gauge transformation derives from the behavior of the gauge eld functions on the singular axis and at the
origin which in turn depend on the theory under consideration. thus, the gauge transformations given in this paper
for yang-mills-dilaton theory do not lead in general to regular gauge potentials in dierent theories involving the
static axially symmetric ansatz, eq. (1). however, we have outlined a possible way how one can proceed to nd
suitable gauge transformations in theories, where multi-monopoles [10,11] or multi-sphalerons [14,1619] have been
constructed within the ansatz eq. (1). for example, for the multi-sphalerons in einstein-yang-mills(-dilaton) theory
the expansion on the positive z-axis up to third order in  is given in ref. [17]. from their result it can be seen easily,
that for winding number n = 2 the gauge transformation leading to a regular gauge potential along the positive
z-axis coincides with the corresponding gauge transformation given in this paper, eq. (18). we conjecture, that the
same result will hold for the static axially symmetric black hole solutions in einstein-yang-mills(-dilaton) theory
constructed in ref. [19]. more work has to be done for the sphaleron and black hole solutions carrying larger winding
numbers [26].

finally let us compare with the spherically symmetric case. the ansatz for the gauge potential

ai(~r) =

a(r)  1

2r

ij

rj
r



is not well dened at the origin, r = 0, even when the boundary condition a(0) = 1 is imposed. regularity requires
a(r) = 1  br2 + o(r3), where b is a constant. this condition is not guaranteed a priori. instead, for a given model
it has to be checked whether the regularity condition follows from the analysis of the solution at the origin, i. e. at
the singular point. the similarity to the axially symmetric case is striking. in that case we have also performed
the analysis at the singularities, the z-axis and the origin, and found that the gauge potential is regular, if we apply
suitable gauge transformations.
