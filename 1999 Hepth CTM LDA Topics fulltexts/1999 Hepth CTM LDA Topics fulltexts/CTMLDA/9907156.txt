(3.6) (3.7) 5 subtracted vacuum energy. formulation easy exercise verify energy bound (3.4), edbi q given (3.7) (2.8) respectively, show sigma model solitons, given (2.10) f holomorphic (or anti-holomorphic) function, saturate bound. 4 non-bps dbi solitons shall nd that, remarkably, non-bps sigma model solitons also solutions dbi eld equations. prove begin computing dbi eld equations static congurations follow variation (3.6). little algebra nd static eld equations di{ = (diu ) (dj u ) u {(diu )(diu ) (diu )(dj u )}. q1 + 2(dl u )(dlu ) (dlu )(dku ) q1 + 2(dlu )(dlu ) (dlu )(dku ) } (4.1) convenient introduce notation tij (diu)(dju) rewrite equation (4.1) form d1{ d2{ (d1u)(1 + 2t22) (d2u)(t12 + t21) (d2u)(1 + 2t11) (d1u)(t12 + t21) q1 + 2t11 + 2t22 + 4t11t22 (t12 + t21)2 q1 + 2t11 + 2t22 + 4t11t22 (t12 + t21)2 q1 + 2t11 + 2t22 + 4t11t22 (t12 + t21)2 u next observe impose following constraints t11 = t22, t12 = t21 equations (4.2) simplied d1d1u + d2d2u + u(t11 + t22) = 0 } + } + = 0. (4.2) (4.3) (4.4) exactly sigma model eld equations static congurations (2.7). thus nd static solutions sigma model equations also satisfy constraints (4.3) also static solutions dbi equations. bps solitons solve equations (2.9) automatically obey constraints (4.3) (and additional 6 property t12 = it11). shall show sigma model non-bps solitons also satisfy constraints. terms complex variable z = x1 + ix2 pair real equations (4.3) written single complex equation (dzu)(dzu) = 0. (4.5) denition p+, given (2.11), following properties may proved (see eg. {$9611008$}) f holomorphic vector, (p k +f ) p l +f = 0, z(cid:16)p k +f(cid:17) = p k1 + f k 6= l |p k +f |2 |p k1 + f |2 , + f z p k1 + f |2! = |p k1 (4.6) (4.7) p k +f |p k1 + f |2 . using properties elementary show u non-bps solution given (2.12) dzu = p k+1 + f |p k +f | , dzu = p k1 + f +f | |p k |p k1 + f |2 . (4.8) hence equation (4.5) follows immediately orthogonality property (4.6). completes proof non-bps solitons also solutions dbi model. non-bps solutions interpretation soliton/anti-soliton states sigma model. sigma model {$9611008$} solutions therefore expected unstable congurations. global properties solutions submanifolds cpn investigated {$9611008$}. reader may wonder possible see non-bps solitons solve dbi equations directly lagrangian. course, general inconsistent substitute constraints lagrangian since critical points constrained system generally critical points full theory. bps solitons concern saturate energy bound automatically critical points. therefore enough show dbi lagrangian reduces sigma model lagrangian bps constraints imposed. however, non-bps solutions require little thought. want investigate dbi lagrangian (or equivalently energy density since dealing static sector) reduces sigma model compute (1 + e)2 (1 + edbi)2 = (1 + t11 + t22)2 (1 + 2t11 + 2t22 + 4t11t22 (t12 + t21)2) = (t11 t22)2 + (t12 + t21)2. (4.9) nal line recognize constraints (4.3) two crucial points noted. dbi energy density identical sigma model 7 constraints (4.3) hold. rst point constraints weaker bps equations solutions, particular shown non-bps solitons satisfy constraints. second point expression quadratic constraints, variation proportional constraints vanishes imposition. explains critical points constrained system, sigma model, also critical points full dbi theory. 5 sigma model vs dbi dynamics seen, static sigma model bps solitons also solving dbi eld equations. therefore natural compare dynamics slowly moving bps solitons sigma model dbi model, using moduli space approximation {$9611008$}. naively might expected low energy dynamics bps solutions two theories since low energy limit. however, agreement two lagrangians quadratic order derivatives elds ie. space time, whereas moduli space approximation assumes time derivatives small truncation spatial derivatives. thus clear whether dynamics dbi solitons match sigma model solitons. moduli space sigma model solitons kahler manifold {$9611008$}. moduli space approximation truncates full eld dynamics motion bps soliton moduli space. applying bps soliton equation (2.9) dbi lagrangian (3.2) written ldbi = q(1 + 2t11)(1 + 2t11 2t00 4(t11t00 t01t10)) 1 (5.1) notation section four. expanding square root neglecting terms higher order quadratic time derivatives, obtain, integration space ldbi = 2|q| z d2x(t00 + 2(t11t00 t01t10)) . (5.2) rst term potential energy charge q soliton remaining term denes metric q-soliton moduli space, respect dynamics approximated geodesic motion. rst term integrand kinetic energy sigma model, thus metric moduli space dbi solitons equal sigma model solitons term (which write full) k 2z {(d1u)(d1u)(d0u)(d0u) (d0u)(d1u)(d1u)(d0u)} d2x (5.3) vanishes equal total time derivative. cp1 model term indeed zero. easiest way see choose parameterization (which done without loss generality using local u(1) 8 symmetry) terms easily found u = 1 q1 + |w|2 (cid:18) 1 w(cid:19) (1 + |w|2)3/2 (cid:18) w 1 (cid:19) . w du = (5.4) (5.5) thus d0u proportional d1u hence integrand (5.3) identically zero. however, cancellation unique property cp1 case derives fact one (complex) eld. demonstrate cpn model n > 1 term (5.3) non-zero enough consider cp2 case (since cp2 totally geodesic submanifold cpn n > 2). writing cp2 eld 1 u = 1 w1 w2 q1 + |w1|2 + |w2|2 k = z 2|0w1zw2 0w2zw1|2 (1 + |w1|2 + |w2|2)3 d2x. (5.6) (5.7) either w1 w2 identically zero term vanishes, corresponding em- bedding cp1 inside cp2, generally (5.7) non-zero. finally, need check term total time derivative, otherwise would contribute
