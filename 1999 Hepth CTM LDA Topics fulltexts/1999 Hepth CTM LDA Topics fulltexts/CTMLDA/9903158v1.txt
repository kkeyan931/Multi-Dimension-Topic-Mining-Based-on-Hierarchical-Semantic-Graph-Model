symplectic reduction of p-form electrodynamics

abstract

we propose a simple method to reduce a general p-form electrodynamics with re-
spect to the standard gauss constraints. the canonical structure of the reduced theory
displays a p-dependent sign which makes the essential dierence between theories with
dierent parities of p. this feature was observed recently in the corresponding quan-
tization condition for p-brane dyons. it suggests that these two structures are closely
related.

1 introduction

the p-form electrodynamics is a simple generalization of an ordinary electrodynamics in 4-
dimensional minkowski space-time m4 where the electromagnetic eld potential 1-form a
is replaced by a p-form in d-dimensional space-time [1], [2]. the motivation to study such
type of theories comes e.g. from the string theory where one considers higher dimensional
objects (so called p-branes [3]) interacting with a gauge eld. p-branes are natural objects
which couple in a gauge invariant way to a p-form gauge potential and, therefore, they play
a role of elementary extended sources.

recently the new input to study a p-form theory came from the electric-magnetic duality
which started to play a prominent role in theoretical physics in the 90. (see e.g. [4]). now, in
order to have p-branes which carry both electric and magnetic charges (i.e. p-brane dyons)
the dimension of space-time has to be equal d = 2p + 2. it turns out [5], [6] that there is a
crucial dierence between p-form theories with dierent parity of p. moreover, quantum me-
chanics implies the following quantization condition upon the electric and magnetic charges
(e1, g1) and (e2, g2) of any two dyons:

e1g2 + (1)pe2g1 = nh ,

(1.1)

with an integer n. for odd p the above condition is a generalization of the famous dirac
condition [7] but for even p it was observed only recently [8][11]. again, a parity of p plays
a crucial role in (1.1).

the aim of the present paper is to show that this p-dependence is already present on
the level of a canonical structure of the underlying p-form theory. this feature is however
hidden in a standard formulation. therefore, we propose a dierent approach. because a
theory possesses a rich abelian gauge symmetry we propose to reduce it with respect to
the corresponding gauss constraints. such a reduction was proposed in the case of ordinary
electrodynamics (and linearized gravity) in [12] (it was applied to the variational formulation
of the electrodynamics of point-like charges in [13] and [14]). the method of this paper is a
straightforward generalization of [12] to a p-form case. we show that the reduced canonical
structure (see formula (4.28)) displays a p-dependent sign in a manner very similar to (1.1)
which shows that duality invariance, quantization condition and canonical structure are
closely related. we postpone the study of this relation to the next paper.
it would be
also interesting to investigate relation between our approach and the standard two potential
formulation of a p-form theory (see e.g. [5] and [15]).

the present paper is organized as follows:

in section 2 we introduce basic facts about
p-form electrodynamics and present its (unreduced) canonical structure in section 3. then
in section 4 we describe a reduction procedure. as an example of a reduced p-form theory we
present a maxwell-type theory in section 5 . all technical details and proofs are contained
in appendixes.

2 p-form electrodynamics

consider a p-form potential a dened in the d = 2p + 2 dimensional minkowski space-time
m2p+2 with the signature of the metric tensor (, +, ..., +). the corresponding eld tensor

2

is dened as a (p + 1)-form by f = da:

f1...p+1 = [1 a2...p+1] ,

(2.1)

where the antisymmetrization is taken with a weight one, i.e. x[kl] := xkl  xlk. having a
lagrangian l of the theory one denes another (p + 1)-form g as follows:

g1...p+1 = (p + 1)!

l

f1...p+1

.

(2.2)

now one may dene the electric and magnetic intensities and inductions in the obvious way:

ei1...ip = fi1...ip0 ,

1

bi1...ip =

(p + 1)!
di1...ip = gi1...ip0 ,

i1...ipj1...jp+1f j1...jp+1 ,

hi1...ip =

1

(p + 1)!

i1...ipj1...jp+1gj1...jp+1 ,

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

where the indices i1, i2, ..., j1, j2, ... run from 1 up to 2p + 1 and i1i2...i2p+1 is the levi-civita
tensor in 2p+1 dimensional euclidean space, i.e. a space-like hyperplane  in the minkowski
space-time. the eld equations are given by the bianchi identities df = 0, or in components

[f1...p+1] = 0 ,

and the true dynamical equations d  g = 0, or equivalently

[  g1...p+1] = 0 ,

where the hodge star operation in m2p+2 is dened by:

 g1...p+1 =

1

(p + 1)!

1...p+11...p+1 g1...p+1

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

and 12...2p+2 is the covariantly constant volume form in the minkowski space-time. note,
that i1...i2p+1 := 0i1...i2p+1. in terms of electric and magnetic elds dened in (2.3)(2.6) the
eld equations (2.7)(2.8) have the following form:

p!

0bi1...ip = (1)p 1
i1bi1...ip = 0 ,
1
0di1...ip =
p!
i1di1...ip = 0 ,

i1...ipkj1...jp kej1...jp ,

i1...ipkj1...jp khj1...jp ,

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

where k denotes the covariant derivative on  compatible with the metric kl induced from
m2p+2. the levi-civita tensor density satises 12...2p+1 = g, with g = det(kl).
the eld equations (2.10)(2.13) may be rewritten using the language of dierentials

forms. obviously d, b, e, h are p-forms on . let us dene (p + 1)-forms:

d := d ,

b := b ,
3

(2.14)

where  denotes the hodge star on : for any k-form

(x)i1...ink :=

1

(n  k)!

i1...inkj1...jk x j1...jk ,

with n = 2p + 1. with this notation one has:

b = (1)p de ,
d = dh ,

db = 0 ,
dd = 0 .

(2.15)

(2.16)
(2.17)

3 canonical structure

the phase space p of gauge invariant congurations (d,b) or equivalently (d, b) is endowed
with the canonical structure. using local coordinates (di1...ip, bj1...jp) the most general 2-
form on p is given by:

p = z d2p+1xz d2p+1yhxi1...ipj1...jp(x, y)di1...ip(x)  bj1...jp(y)

+

+

1
2

2

yi1...ipj1...jp(x, y)di1...ip(x)  dj1...jp(y)
zi1...ipj1...jp(x, y)bi1...ip(x)  bj1...jp(y)(cid:21) .

(3.1)

taking into account the eld equations (2.10) and (2.12) the hamiltonian vector eld xhp

is described by

xhp | p = hp

xhp = z d2p+1x i1...ipkj1...jp kh j1...jp



di1...ip

+ (1)pkej1...jp



bi1...ip! .

therefore, the formula (3.2) is solved by hp and p dened as follows:

hp =

1

2p! z d2p+1x(di1...ipei1...ip + bi1...iphi1...ip) ,

and

p = z d2p+1xz d2p+1y di1...ip(x)  bj1...jp(y)i1...ipkj1...jpk g(x, y) ,

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

where g(x, y) denotes the coulomb green function in 2p + 1 dimensional euclidean space,
i.e.

 g(x, y) = (2p+1)(x  y) .

(3.6)

the formula (3.5) uses only gauge-invariant quantities. it may be, however, considerably
simplied by introducing a gauge potential. one solves (2.11) via:

bi1...ip = i1...ipj1...jp+1 j1aj2...jp+1 ,

(3.7)

4

which is the obvious generalization of b =  a from p = 1 electrodynamics. now, modulo
gauge-dependent boundary term, the symplectic form reads:

p = (1)pz d2p+1x di1...ip  ai1...ip = (1)p+1z d2p+1x g1...p0  a1...p .

(3.8)

having a symplectic structure in p one may easily derive corresponding poisson brackets:

{f ,g}p = z d2p+1x"

f

di1...ip

i1...ipkj1...jp k

bj1...jp  (f  g)# ,
g

(3.9)

where f and g are functionals on p. note, that di1...ip and bi1...ip are not arbitrary but they
have to satisfy the gauss laws (2.11) and (2.13). the fundamental commutation relations
implied by (3.9) read:

{di1...ip(x), bj1...jp(y)}p = i1...ipkj1...jkk(2p+1)(x  y) ,
{di1...ip(x), dj1...jp(y)}p = {bi1...ip(x), bj1...jp(y)}p = 0 ,

(3.10)
(3.11)

with x, y  .

4 reduction

the idea of this section is to nd a new set of electromagnetical variables using a philosophy
of 2p+1 decomposition (it is a straightforward generalization of [12]). these new variables
solve partially the gauss constraints (2.11) and (2.13). moreover, they are canonical with
respect to p.

4.1 2p+1 decomposition

the 2p+1 decomposition is based on the observation that the 2p+1 dimensional euclidean
space  may be decomposed as follows:

where s2p(1) denotes 2p dimensional unit sphere and r represents radial direction. let
us introduce spherical coordinates on :

 = s2p(1)  r ,

(4.1)

xa = a ,

a = 1, 2, ..., 2p ,

x2p+1 = r ,

(4.2)
(4.3)

where 1, 2, ..., 2p denote spherical angles (to enumerate angles we shall use capital letters
a, b, c, ...) (for more details see appendix a). let kl denote the minkowskian metric on 
and let p denote the corresponding volume element, i.e. p = det kl (see (a.3)). finally,
let a1...a2p denote the levi-civita tensor on s2p(r) such that a1...a2p := ra1...a2p
(we use
the same letter to denote the levi-civita tensors on  and s2p(r)). we shall denote by |
the covariant derivative dened by kl on  and by || the covariant derivative on each
s2p(r) dened by the induced metric ab.

4.2 symplectic reduction

let us consider the evolution of the p-form electromagnetic eld in the nite volume v  .
for simplicity we take v = k 2p+1(0, r) (a (2p + 1) dimensional ball of radius r). of course
one may take any v topologically equivalent to k 2p+1(0, r) but then instead of spherical
coordinates one chooses coordinates adapted to v .

to reduce p in v we use the 2p+1 decomposition:

(1)p+1p = zv
= zv

p gi1...ip0  ai1...ip = zv
p (cid:16)p dri2...ip  ari2...ip + da1...ap  aa1...ap(cid:17) .

p di1...ip  ai1...ip

(4.4)

using (3.7) one obtains

ba1...ap = a1...aprb1...bp rab1...bp + p a1...apb1rb2...bp arb2...bp||b1

(4.5)

and hence

a1...apb1...bp ba1...ap||b1 = p!  c1...cp

where we have used the following identity

[b1...bp] (1)phrac1...cp  p arc2...cp||c1i||b1

,

(4.6)

i1...in j1...jm i1...in l1...lm = n! j1...jm

[l1...lm ] := n! j1

[l1

...jm
lm ]

(4.7)

with arbitrary n and m.

now, to simplify our consideration, let us choose the following gauge conditions for a

p-form aa1...ap and (p  1)-form ara2...ap on each sphere s2p(r):
||a2 = 0 .

||a1 = 0 ,

ara2...ap

aa1...ap

in such a gauge

a1...apb1...bp ba1...ap||b1 = (1)p+1p p! r2 

p1 arb2...bp ,

where 

p1 is dened by:



this operator has a clear geometrical interpretation.

p1 := (p  1)!hr2aa  (p2  1)i .

(4.8)

(4.9)

(4.10)

lemma 1 r2
on s2p(r) satisfying x a2...ap

p1 equals to the laplace-beltrami operator for (p1)-forms x = (x a2...ap)

||a2 = 0, i.e.

r2

p1x = (dd + dd)x = ddx .

for proof see appendix b. the factor r2 in (4.10) makes 

p1 r-independent, i.e.

[

p1, r] = 0 .

6

(4.11)

(4.12)

lemma 2 the operator 

p1 is invertible.

for proof see appendix b. denoting by 1

p1 the inverse of 

p1 we nally obtain:

arb2...bp = (1)p+1 r2

p p!

1

p1(cid:16)a1...apb1...bp ba1...ap||b1(cid:17) .

introducing variables:

qa2...ap

(1)
(1)

b2...bp

:= r dra2...ap ,

:=

r
p!

1

p1(cid:16)a1...apb1...bp ba1...ap||b1(cid:17)

we may rewrite the rst integral in (4.4) as

zv

p p dri2...ip  ari2...ip = (1)p+1zv

p (1)

a2...ap  qa2...ap

(1)

(4.13)

(4.14)

(4.15)

.

(4.16)

to reduce the second term in (4.4) observe that in the special gauge (4.8), aa1...ap may be
expressed as follows:

now, from (3.7)

aa1...ap = a1...apb1...bp b2...bp||b1 .

brb2...bp = b2...bpc1...cp+1 ac2...cp+1||c1 .

inserting (4.17) into (4.18) and using once more the gauge conditions (4.8) we obtain

and, therefore

brb2...bp = p! r2 

p1 b2...bp ,

b2...bp = 

r2
p!

1

p1 brb2...bp ,

which, together with (4.17), gives

aa1...ap = 

r2
p!

a1...apb1...bp (cid:16)1

p1 brb2...bp(cid:17)||b1

.

having aa1...ap we may calculate the second term in (4.4):

p1(cid:16)a1...apb1...bp da1...ap||b1(cid:17)

(4.23)

(4.24)

we may rewrite (4.22) as

zv

p da1...ap  aa1...ap = zv

7

p (2)

a2...ap  qa2...ap

(2)

.

(4.25)

now, taking into account (4.16) and (4.25) we have nally

p = zv

p(cid:16)(1)

a2...ap  qa2...ap

(1)

+ (1)p+1(2)

a2...ap  qa2...ap

(2)

let us use more compact notation

our result may be formulated as

x  y := x a2...apya2...ap .

(cid:17) .

(4.26)

(4.27)

theorem 1 the reduced symplectic structure red
(q(), ()) the following form:

p

has on the reduced phase space p red

p

:=

red

p = zv

p(cid:16)(1)  q(1) + (1)p+1(2)  q(2)(cid:17) .

the above theorem obviously implies

theorem 2 the corresponding reduced poisson bracket (3.9) reads:

{f ,g}red

p = zv

p " f
q(1) 

g
(1) + (1)p+1 f
q(2) 

(2)  (f  g)# .
g

this formula leads to the following commutation relations:

(1)

{qa2...ap
{qa2...ap

(2)

(x), (1)
(x), (2)

b2...bp(y)}red
b2...bp(y)}red

[b2...bp] (2p+1)(x  y) ,

(4.28)

(4.29)

(4.30)

(4.31)

and the remaining brackets vanish.

4.3 reconstruction

now, could we reconstruct d and b in terms of qs and s? the answer is positive by
virtue of the following reconstruction

theorem 3 the variables (q(), ();  = 1, 2) contain the entire gauge-invariant infor-
mation about the elds di1...ip and bi1...ip.

proof: we show that q(1) and (2) encode the information about d eld. due to (4.14) it is
enough to show how to reconstruct the tangential part of d, i.e. da1...ap. let us make the
following decomposition (see appendix a):

da1...ap = u [a2...ap||a1] + a1...apb1...bpvb2...bp||b1 .

lemma 3 the following identities hold:

r2da1...ap

||a1 = 
r2a1...apb1...bp da1...ap||b1 = 

p1 u a2...ap ,
p1 vb2...bp .

8

(4.32)

(4.33)

(4.34)

for proof see appendix b. therefore

vb2...bp = p! r (2)

b2...bp .

now, to reconstruct u a2...ap let us use (2.13).
lemma 4 the gauss constraints dka2...ap

|k are equivalent to

r(r2p dra2...ap) + r2pda1a2...ap

||a1 = 0 .

the proof see appendix b. finally, due to (4.36)

in the same way one shows that q(2) and (1) reconstruct b eld.

u a2...ap = r21

p1 r(cid:16)r2p1 qa2...ap

(1)

(cid:17) .

4.4 counting degrees of freedom

(4.35)

(4.36)

(4.37)

2

let us count the total number np of degrees of freedom for a p-form theory. dene a number
np

k by:

np

k :=   2p + 1

k

! .

(4.38)

a p-form potential ai1...ip on  has np
freedom

p independent components. however, due to a gauge

ai1...ip  ai1...ip + [i1(1)

i2...ip]

(4.39)

some of them may be gauged away e.g. to zero. (1)
equation (4.39) is still invariant under

i1...ip1 carries np

p1 components but the

(1)
i1...ip1  (1)

i1...ip1 + [i1(2)

i2...ip1] .

(4.40)

therefore, some of the components of (1) may be gauged away via (2) which has np
p2
components. the same argument applies for (2) and one continues up to a 0-form p
carrying obviously only one component. therefore, the total number of degrees of freedom
carried by ai1...ip equals:

np = np

p  np

p1 + np

p2  ... + (1)pnp
0 .

using the standard mathematical induction it is easy to prove that

now, note that q(1) and q(2) carry together

np =   2p

p ! .

(4.41)

(4.42)

(4.43)

(4.44)

therefore,

and the equality holds only for p = 1. it means that for p > 1, q() are not independent.

mp = 2  2p

2p

p + 1

np .

p  1 ! =
mp  np

9

lemma 5 for p > 1, reduced variables q() and () satisfy the following constraints:

a2qa2...ap

()

= 0 , a2()

a2...ap = 0 .

(4.45)

the proof follows obviously from (2.11) and (2.13). note, that these constraints are trivially
satised for p = 1.

5 maxwell theory

the simplest p-form theory is of the maxwell type, i.e. constitutive relations between induc-
tions (d, b) and intensities (e, h) are linear:

di1...ip = ei1...ip ,

bi1...ip = h i1...ip .

(5.1)

in such a case it is easy to rewrite eld equations (2.10) and (2.12) in terms of qs and s.

theorem 4 equations (2.10) and (2.12) are equivalent to:

p1 a2...ap

(1)

,

(1)

qa2...ap
= 
qa2...ap
= (1)p
(2)
(1)
a2...ap = 1
(2)
a2...ap = (1)p1
a2...ap := a2b2...apbpqb2...bp

()

p1hr12

(2)

p1 a2...ap
r (rq(1)
p1hr12

,

where q()

a2...ap) + r2
r (rq(2)

a2...ap) + r2

a2...api ,
p1 q(2)

p1 q(1)

a2...api ,

and a2...ap

()

:= a2b2...apbp()

b2...bp .

(5.2)

(5.3)

(5.4)

(5.5)

for proof see appendix c. these equations may be derived from the following hamiltonian:

hp =

1

2(p  1)! z phr2q()  q()  r2pr(r2p1q())1

p1  r(rq())

 ()

p1  ()i ,

i.e.

q() = {q(), hp}red
() = {(), hp}red

p

p

,

,

(5.6)

(5.7)

(5.8)

with the poisson bracket dened in (4.29). one easily shows that the numerical value of
hp is equal to the standard (i.e. obtained via the symmetric energy-momentum tensor)
electromagnetic energy contained in v , i.e.

hp =

1

2p! zv

p(cid:16)di1...ipdi1...ip + bi1...ipbi1...ip(cid:17) .

appendixes

a geometry of s2p(r)

the relation between cartesian (y1, y2, ..., y2p+1) and spherical coordinates (x1, x2, ..., x2p+1)
introduced in (4.2)(4.3) reads as follows:

y1 = r sin 2p sin 2p1... sin 3 sin 2 sin 1 ,
y2 = r sin 2p sin 2p1... sin 3 sin 2 cos 1 ,
y3 = r sin 2p sin 2p1... sin 3 cos 2 ,
...

y2p = r sin 2p cos 2p1 ,

y2p+1 = r cos 2p .

one easily calculates the corresponding christoel symbols. the only nonvanishing symbols
are:

now, one easily nds the riemann tensor on s2p(r):

br = r1a

ab = r1ab .

rabcd = r2(ac db  adcb) ,

(a.5)

where ab denotes the induced metric on each s2p(r). the corresponding ricci tensor rab
and a scalar curvature r read:

rab =

2p  1

r2

ab , r =

2p(2p  1)

r2

(a.6)

finally, let a1...a2p denote the levi-civita tensor density on s2p(r) such that

let x = xa1...ap denote any p-form eld on s2p(r). this eld may be decomposed as follows:

12...2p = p .

xa1...ap = [a1a2...ap] + a1...apb1...bpb1b2...bp ,

formula (a.7) follows from the hodge theorem

x = d + d + h ,

(a.8)

with  being a (p1)-form,  a (p+1)-form and h a harmonic p-form. note, that there is no
harmonic term in (a.7) because the set of harmonic p-forms on s2p(r) is empty. obviously,
 =    for some constant . to nd  note, that for even dimensional riemannian
manifolds the adjoint d of d reads:

d =   d

(a.9)

and,therefore, d =   d  . now, on a riemannian n-dimensional manifold

(a.10)
and hence for n = 2p,    = (1)p+1. therefore, d = (1)p  d which implies
 = (1)p.

  k = (1)k(nk)k ,

b proofs

b.1 proof of lemma 1
consider any (p1)-form x = (xa2...ap) on s2p(r) such that a2xa2...ap = 0. this condition
may be rewritten as

d x = 0 .

therefore, the laplacian on x reduces to

due to (a.9), dd x may be calculated as follows:

= c1c2...cp
= (p  1)!(cid:16)aa xa2...ap + (1)pa[a2xa3...ap]a(cid:17) .

to calculate the second term note that

a[a2xa3...ap]a = a(cid:16)a2xa3...apa  a3xa2a4...apa

 ...  apxa2...ap1a2a(cid:17) .

(b.4)

now, we use the following well known property of the riemann tensor

[a,b]t c1...ck = rc1

dabt dc2...ck + ... + rck

dabt c2...ck1d ,

which holds for any tensor eld t c1...ck. using (b.5) one has:

aa2x a3...apa = a2b[a,b]x a3...apa = a2b(cid:16)ra3

+... + rap

cabx a3...ap1ca + ra

cabx ca4...apa
cabx a3...apc(cid:17) .

using (a.5) one obtains

a2bra3

cabx ca4...apa = r2a2ba3d(dacb  dbca)x ca4...apa

= r2x a2a4...apa3 = r2(1)p+1x a2...ap .

exactly the same result holds for the rst (p  2) terms in (b.6). the last term
cabx a3...apc = a2brcbx a3...apc = r2(1)p(2p  1)x a2...ap ,

a2bra

due to (a.6). finally,

(  d  dx)a2...ap = (p  1)!haa  r2(p2  1)i xa2...ap

= r2

b.2 proof of lemma 2

it is a well known fact from the theory of cohomology that on sn(r) the kernel of 
k is
nontrivial only for k = 0 and k = n. the p = 1 case (i.e. an ordinary electrodynamics
0 = r2aa possesses zero modes which are simply constant
in m4) is special because 
functions on s2(r). this problem was treated in [12].

b.3 proof of lemma 3

let x = (xa1...ap) be a p-form on s2p(r). due to the hodge theorem (a.8) it may be
decomposed as follows:

xa1...ap = [a1a2...ap] + a1...apb1...bpb1b2...bp ,

i.e.  and  are (p  1)-forms on s2p(r):

let us choose a following gauge condition for  and :

x = d + d .

d = d = 0 .

(b.10)

(b.11)

(b.12)

now, taking into account (b.11) and lemma 1 one obtains

dx = dd = r2

p1

and

rewriting (b.13) and (b.14) in components on obtains:

 dx = d  d = dd = 

p1 .

r2x a1a2...ap

||a1 = 

p1a2...ap ,

and



p1b2...bp = r2(dx)b2...bp = 1
(p + 1)!
= a1...apb1...bpb1xa1...ap .

b2...bpb1a1...ap[b1xa1...ap]

b.4 proof of lemma 4

dki2...ip

|k = kdki2...ip + k

kjdji2...ip + (p  1) i2

kjdkji3...ip ,

where the last term obviously vanishes. therefore

dka2...ap

|k = rdra2...ap + bdba2...ap

+ r

rrdra2...ap + r

rbdbi2...ip + b

brdra2...ap + b

bc dca2...ap .

now, taking into account (a.4)

dka2...ap

|k = (cid:18)rdra2...ap +

dra2...ap(cid:19) +(cid:16)bdba2...ap + b

c derivation of maxwell equations

using (2.12) one obtains:

now, for any tensor eld x ...

a... one has:

[r,b] = 0 ,

to prove (c.3) note, that

(c.4)

(rx ...

but

and the formula (c.3) follows. using (c.3) one obtains

(c.5)

now,

r(cid:16)r2db1...bp

due to lemma 4. finally,

||b1(cid:17) = r(cid:16)r2b2c2...bpcpdc1...cp

||c1(cid:17)
