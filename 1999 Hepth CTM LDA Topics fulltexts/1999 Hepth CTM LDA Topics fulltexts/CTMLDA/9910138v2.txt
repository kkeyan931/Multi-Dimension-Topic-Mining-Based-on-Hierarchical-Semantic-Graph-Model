the world-volume theory on a d-brane in a constant b-eld background can be

described by either commutative or noncommutative yang-mills theories. these two de-

scriptions correspond to two dierent gauge xing of the dieomorphism on the brane.

comparing the boundary states in the two gauges, we derive a map between commutative

and noncommutative gauge elds in a path integral form, when the gauge group is u (1).

1. introduction

noncommutativity of coordinates appears in the study of d-branes in two apparently

dierent situations. one such situation occurs when n d-branes coincide. then their

transverse coordinates are promoted to n  n matrices. another situation is the one in
which the boundary coordinates x i( ) of an open string become noncommutative in the
presence of a constant ns-ns b-eld [1,2,3,4]. the commutation relations of x i( )s are

written as

[x i( ), x j( )] = iij.

(1.1)

these relations lead to the noncommutativity of the world-volume coordinates of d-branes,

which was rst appeared in the compactication of matrix theory in a three-form eld

background [59].

as was pointed out in [10], in a sense these two noncommutativity are dual to each

other. a d-brane in a constant b-eld background can be described as a collection of in-

nitely many lower dimensional d-branes [10,11,12,13]. in this description, the transverse

coordinates of lower dimensional d-branes should satisfy the same relation as (1.1).

in [14], seiberg and witten argued that the theory on d-branes in a b-eld back-

ground can be described by either commutative or noncommutative yang-mills theories

and these descriptions correspond to pauli-villars and point splitting regularizations of

the world-sheet theory, respectively. they derived the relation between the commutative

gauge eld a and the noncommutative gauge eld ba by requiring the equivalence of the
gauge transformation of a and ba.

in the d-brane world-volume perspective, these two descriptions correspond to two

dierent gauge xing of the world-volume dieomorphism [15,16]. one is the static gauge

and the other is the constant eld strength gauge (in the following, we will call the

latter gauge f =  gauge). in the static gauge, the coordinates parallel to the brane

are xed and the ordinary gauge eld remains as a dynamical eld.

in f =  gauge,

the uctuation of ordinary gauge eld is set to zero. in this gauge, the dynamical degree

of freedom are carried by the scalar elds corresponding to the parallel coordinates of

the brane. the noncommutative gauge eld appears as the uctuation of this scalar eld

around the static gauge conguration. the two dierent descriptions are mapped to each

other by the world-volume dieomorphism.

in [15,16], the relation between a and ba is derived from the dieomorphism invariance

of d-branes, but only in a semiclassical sense, i.e. the moyal bracket is replaced with the

1

poisson bracket. to quantize the poisson bracket into moyal bracket, it is useful to use

the path integral formalism [17,18]. in this paper, we will derive the map a 7 ba in a

path integral form by comparing the boundary states in the two dierent gauges, when

the gauge group is u (1). the main claim of this paper is that the map is given by

z d() exp(cid:18)iz d
=z d() exp(cid:18)iz d

2

ijij + ai(y + )(yi + i)(cid:19)
ijij + bai(y + )yi(cid:19)

(1.2)

where ij = (1)ij and yi() is an arbitrary function. we will show that this relation

satises the requirement for the mapping between a and ba, namely the equivalence of the
gauge transformations for a and ba.

here we comment on the relation between (1.2) and the interpretation of the origin of

noncommutativity in [14]. the left hand side of (1.2) is divergent due to the contraction of

() and () at the same . we regularized it preserving the ordinary gauge invariance

of a. on the other hand, the right hand side is nite because of the absence of this

contraction. therefore (1.2) naturally realizes the idea of [14], namely the commutative

and noncommutative descriptions of gauge theory on d-branes correspond to the two

dierent regularizations (point-splitting and pauli-villars) of the worldsheet theory.

this paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we review the symmetries of boundary

states and the derivation of the map in the semiclassical form. in section 3, we derive the

relation (1.2) by comparing the boundary states in the two dierent gauges and show that

it gives the correct relation between a and ba. we also argue how to regularize the left hand

side of (1.2) without breaking the ordinary gauge invariance of a. section 4 is devoted to

discussions.

2. symmetries of d-brane boundary states

in this section, we consider boundary states in a constant background b-eld and

their symmetries.

in the following, we will gauge away the b-eld in the bulk of the

world-sheet and treat it as a gauge eld background with constant eld strength. to

construct boundary states, it is convenient to introduce the coherent state |xi dened by
x i()|xi = xi()|xi. |xi can be written as

|xi = exp(cid:18)iz dpi()xi()(cid:19) |di

2

(2.1)

where |di is the dirichlet boundary state dened by x i()|di = 0 and pi is the momentum
conjugate to x i. when we consider a dp-brane, i runs from 0 to p. using |xi, the boundary

state coupled to a u (1) gauge eld a is given by [19]

|bi =z dxeir a(x)|xi.

in the case of the constant eld strength fij = ij, (2.2) is reduced to

|bi =z dx exp(cid:18)iz d

1
2

ijxixj  pixi(cid:19) |di.

(2.2)

(2.3)

in the following, we assume that p is odd and ij is invertible.

now we consider the uctuation of the dp-brane around the above conguration. the

most general form of the boundary state is

|a, i =z d(x) exp(cid:18)iz d(cid:0)ai(x)xi  pii(x)(cid:1)(cid:19) |di,

(2.4)

where ai is the gauge eld on the dp-brane and i is the scalar eld corresponding to the
coordinate parallel to the dp-brane. we suppress the transverse coordinates of the brane

for simplicity. the uctuation around the conguration (2.3) is parameterized as

ai =

1
2

jixj + ai, i = xi + ijaj.

(2.5)

following [15,16], we review the argument that ai and ai become the ordinary and

noncommutative gauge elds, respectively, after the gauge xing of the dieomorphism on

the d-brane. so as to make |a, i dieomorphism invariant, we choose the measure d(x)

in (2.4) as

d(x) =y

dx() det(cid:18) i

xj(cid:19)(cid:0)x()(cid:1).

(2.6)

under the dieomorphism on the dp-brane, a and i transform as a 1-form and a scalar,

respectively, i.e.

dia = lva = (div + ivd)a,

di i = lvi = vkki.

|a, i is also invariant under the gauge transformation

gaugea = d, gauge = 0,

3

(2.7)

(2.8)

and the canonical transformation

where ham is a hamiltonian vector eld dened by

cana = 0, can = lham,

ihamf = d.

(2.9)

(2.10)

we can see that the canonical transformation is equivalent to the eld dependent gauge

transformation up to the dieomorphism:

can() = gauge( + ihama) + di (ham).

(2.11)

by xing the dieomorphism invariance, we can obtain two dierent pictures for the
same state. the rst is the static gauge which is dened by i = xi. in this gauge,
|a, i is reduced to

|di.

(2.12)

|ai =z dxeir apixi

|i =z d(x)eir 1

the second is the f =  gauge. in this gauge, the uctuation of a is set to be zero,

and |a, i becomes

2 ij xidxj pii

|di.

(2.13)

for |ai, the residual dieomorphism invariance is the canonical transformation with re-

spect to the symplectic form f which coincides with the usual gauge symmetry for a, or

for a. on the other hand, |i has no gauge eld but it has a residual dieomorphism

symmetry which preserves the symplectic form . its action on  is given by

 = {, } = klkl.

in terms of ai, this symmetry is written as ijaj = {i, }, or

ai = i + klkail.

(2.14)

(2.15)

since the two states |ai and |i correspond to two dierent gauge choice for the same

state, they should be equivalent under the dieomorphism. under the change of variable

x = (y)

(2.16)

in the path integral (2.12), the equivalence of the two states (2.12) and (2.13) requires

a =

1
2

ij yidyj + d().

(2.17)

this relation gives a nontrivial mapping between ai and ai [15,16].

although one can show that ai is equal to the noncommutative gauge eld ba up to the
second order in -expansion, ai is obviously not equal to ba since the gauge transformation

for ai (2.15) is given in terms of the poisson bracket instead of the moyal bracket.

4

3. the map between commutative and noncommutative gauge fields

in this section, we propose the resolution of the discrepancy between ai and bai and
give a simple rule for the map between ai and bai. as we will see below, in order to realize
the noncommutative gauge symmetry for ba, we should change the integration measure in

|i from d(x) to the at measure dx. we write the state with the measure dx as

|inc =z dx exp(cid:18)iz d

1
2

ijxixj  pii(x)(cid:19) |di.

with this measure, the uctuation of i can be identied with ba:

i(x) = xi + ijbaj(x).

to show that |inc is invariant under the noncommutative gauge transformation for

ba, it is convenient to use the t-dual picture. in terms of the coherent state f|yi for the

t-dual coordinate, |di is written as

|di =z dyf|yi.

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

on f|yi, pi acts as yi. therefore, the original and the t-dual coherent state are related

[20] by

|xi =z dy exp(cid:18)iz dyixi(cid:19)f|yi.

using these relations, |inc can be written as

|inc =z dxdy exp(cid:18)iz d
=z dxdy exp(cid:18)iz d
=z ddy exp(cid:18)iz d

ijyiyj + bai( + y)yi(cid:19)f|yi

where i = xi  ijyj and yi = ijyj. for notational simplicity, we introduce the quantity

cw (ba) =(cid:28)exp(cid:18)iz dbai(y + )yi(cid:19)(cid:29)

5

,

(3.6)

where the expectation value is dened by

h  i =z d (  )eir d 1

2 ij i j

.

(3.7)

using cw (ba), eq.(3.5) is written as

in the same way, |ai becomes

1
2

|inc =z dycw (ba) exp(cid:18)iz d
ijyiyj(cid:19)f|yi.
|ai =z dy w (a) exp(cid:18)iz d

w (a) =(cid:28)exp(cid:18)iz dai(y + )(yi + i)(cid:19)(cid:29)

the equivalence of the two descriptions |inc and |ai requires

(3.12)

(3.13)

with

ba is

w (a) =cw (ba).

in the rest of this section, we will show that eq.(3.11) gives the correct mapping between

what we have to show are:

the ordinary gauge eld a and the noncommutative gauge eld ba.
(1) w (a) and cw (ba) have the same transformation property under the ordinary and
(2) eq.(3.11) has a nontrivial solution ba(a).

if these two conditions are satised, the map obtained from (3.11) agrees with the one

noncommutative gauge transformations, respectively.

dened in [14].

first let us consider the condition (1). the noncommutative gauge transformation for

where the star product is dened by

f  g(x) =

xn=0

k1l1    knln k1    kn f (x)l1    ln g(x).

by expanding the exponential in cw (ba) and performing the wick contraction of  using

the two-point function

(cid:10)i()j()(cid:11) =(cid:2)(i)1(cid:3)ij
cw (ba) can be rewritten as
n!z d1    dnt(cid:0)bai1      bain(cid:1)1 yi1    n yin

cw (ba) = 1 +

 t exphiz dbai(y)yii
tnf(cid:0)y(1)(cid:1)  g(cid:0)y(2)(cid:1)o = (1  2)f  g + (2  1)g  f.

where t denotes the time ordering. for example,

(3.14)

(3.15)

(3.16)

note that (3.15) is the simplest example of the path integral representation of the star

product studied in [17,18]. in (3.15), we generalized the notion of the star product to the

product of functions at dierent points:

f (x)  g(y) =

1

n!(cid:18) i
2(cid:19)n

xn=0

k1l1    knln k1    kn f (x)l1    ln g(y).

(3.17)

from the expression (3.15), we can easily see that under the noncommutative gauge trans-

formation (3.12)cw (ba) transforms as

where we set the range of -integration to [i, f ].

cw (ba + ba) = eib(y(f )) cw (ba)  eib(y(i))

(3.18)

next we consider the transformation law of w (a) under ai = i. naively, w (a)

transforms as

w (a + d) =(cid:28)exp(cid:18)iz f

i

dai(y + )(yi + i)

+ i(cid:0)y(f ) + (f )(cid:1)  i(cid:0)y(i) + (i)(cid:1)!+

(3.19)

= eib(,a)(f )  w (a)  eib(,a)(i),

whereb(, a) is some function of  and a whose explicit form is not needed in the following
discussion. (3.19) shows that w (a) has the same transformation property as that ofcw (ba).

7

but we should take care of the divergence coming from the contraction of i and i with
the same argument, since hi(1)2 j(2)i is proportional to the delta function (1 2).
to make w (a) nite, we regularize it by modifying the propagator of :

w (a) =z d exp(cid:18)iz d

1
2

ijim (, )j + ai(y + )(yi + i)(cid:19)

with

m (, ) =  

3

2

.

(3.20)

(3.21)

by the power counting, we can see that 3
function singularity in hi(1)2 j(2)i. explicitly, the propagator is given by

 term in m is sucient to smear the delta-

hi(1)j(2)i =

i
2

hi(1)2j(2)i = iij 
2

ij(1  2)(cid:16)1  e|12|(cid:17)

e|12|.

(3.22)

this regularization does not break the gauge covariance of w (a) (3.19) since we do not

change the second term of the exponent in (3.20).

now we consider the condition (2). for the equation w (a) =cw (ba) to have a solution,
w (a) has to be the same form ascw (ba), namely the time ordered exponential. to explain

that this is true, we expand w (a) as

w (a) =

wn(a)

xn=0

where w0(a) = 1 and for n > 1 wn(a) is dened by

wn(a) =(cid:28) 1

n!(cid:18)iz dai(y + )(yi + i)(cid:19)n(cid:29)

.

we write the rst few terms of the expansion of w (a). w1(a) becomes

w1(a) =z dw1(a) =z dhiai(y)yi + wdiv

we can deduce the structure of wn(a) without the knowledge of the explicit form of

(3.32)

n (a, ) is dened as the term in wn(a) which does not contain the factor y. notice
is nite since the divergence in wn(a) comes from the contraction involving n

that a(n)

eq.(3.31) means that w (a) has the form of the time ordered exponential, i.e.

w

n (a, ).

.

in principle, we can calculate the right hand side of (3.36) to any order in  by the simple

rule of the wick contraction. it might be possible to write down the explicit form of the

map to all order in  in the same way as [17,18], but we do not discuss it here.

we comment on the relation between our result and the argument of regularization in

[14]. since cw (ba) has the contraction between s but does not contain the contraction of
the form h(1)(2)i, cw (ba) corresponds to the point-splitting regularization. on the

other hand, w (a) is regularized so as to preserve the covariance under the ordinary gauge

symmetry. this is nothing but the mechanism of the appearance of the two descriptions

of gauge theory on d-branes due to the possibility of two dierent regularizations. the

only dierence between our formalism and that in [14] is the dimension of the space on

which the path integral is performed.

in [14] the path integral is dened on the whole

2-dimensional worldsheet, while we consider that on the boundary of worldsheet.

4. discussions

in this paper, we derived the map between a and ba in a path integral form by com-

paring the boundary states in two dierent gauges of the world-volume dieomorphism. to

realize the noncommutative gauge symmetry, we chose the at measure dx in |inc. this
measure does not respect the canonical transformation symmetry of |i. this dierence

between |i and |inc may be related to the gauge equivalence of the star product [17].
this viewpoint deserves further study.

we comment on the generalization of our result to u (n ) gauge elds. one natural

way to generalize (1.2) is to replace the exponential with the trace of path ordered expo-

nential. but the relation obtained by this prescription is not enough to determine the map

10

completely, since the gauge eld has n 2 components. to construct the complete map, we

may have to use the additional symmetry of the boundary state, such as the non-abelian

generalization of dieomorphism considered in [15].
