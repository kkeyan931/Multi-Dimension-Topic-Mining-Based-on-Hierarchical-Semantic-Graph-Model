abstract

we show how to construct chiral tachyon-free perturbative orientifold models, where

supersymmetry is broken at the string scale on a collection of branes while, to lowest

order, the bulk and the other branes are supersymmetric. in higher orders, supersym-

metry breaking is mediated to the remaining sectors, but is suppressed by the size of

the transverse space or by the distance from the brane where supersymmetry break-

ing primarily occurred. this setting is of interest for orbifold models with discrete

torsion, and is of direct relevance for low-scale string models. it can guarantee the

stability of the gauge hierarchy against gravitational radiative corrections, allowing

an almost exact supergravity a millimeter away from a non-supersymmetric world.

the breaking of supersymmetry in string theory is a long-standing fundamental prob-

lem with many ramications.

it is related to the selection of the correct vacuum state,

to the cosmological constant problem, to the lifting of at directions for string moduli,

and is a necessary ingredient of a realistic string phenomenology. unfortunately, despite

the recent progress in the understanding of non-perturbative phenomena based on string

dualities, little was done on the problem of supersymmetry breaking.

in perturbation theory, closed string vacua with spontaneously broken1 supersymmetry

can be constructed generalizing the scherk-schwarz mechanism, and in particular resorting

to freely acting orbifolds [1, 2]. the breaking scale is then xed by a compactication

radius, and realistic scenarios ask for radii of the order of a few tev [2]. this approach

is therefore likely to be relevant if the string scale is far below the planck mass [3], and

possibly close to electro-weak energies [4, 5, 6]. a natural framework for such models is

the type-i string theory, where gauge interactions are localized on d-branes while gravity

propagates in the bulk [5].

scherk-schwarz compactications were recently extended to type i string models in [7],

where a new feature was pointed out: the massless spectra of d-branes orthogonal to the

coordinate used for the breaking remain supersymmetric at the tree level. as a result,

in this case the scale of supersymmetry breaking in the observable world is not directly

proportional to the compactication scale, and can have lower values, making this class

of constructions more exible and potentially relevant even if the string scale is moved to

intermediate values [8, 9].

the main problem with this mechanism is the cosmological constant. the reason is

that the bulk energy density behaves generically as bulk  1/r4+d, where r is the radius
of the coordinate used to break supersymmetry and d is the dimensionality of the space

transverse to our brane world, assumed large with respect to the string scale. the projection

(r  r << o(tev1)), one obtains brane  1/r4. in both cases, the energy density on
the brane is far above the tev scale, and this destabilizes the hierarchy that one tries to

enforce. one way out is to resort to special models with broken supersymmetry but with

a vanishing or exponentially small cosmological constant [11].

alternatively, one could conceive a dierent scenario, with supersymmetry broken pri-

mordially on our brane world and a string scale of a few tev. in this case the brane

cosmological constant would be, by construction, o(m 4

cal constant induced in the bulk would be bulk  m 4

in models with an intermediate string scale  1011 gev [9], if it occurs on a brane distant
from our world and is therefore mediated to us by gravitational interactions.

the purpose of this letter is to show that it is possible to construct perturbative ori-

entifold models [13] where supersymmetry breaking originates from a collection of branes,

while both the bulk spectrum and the spectrum of other branes are supersymmetric at

tree-level. whereas models with bulk supersymmetry can naturally be constructed in the

eective eld theory, for instance appealing to non-perturbative super-yang-mills dynam-

4

ics, we believe that a direct string construction is of some interest, in particular to attain

a better comparison with eld theory supersymmetry breaking mechanisms.

brane supersymmetry breaking can also be induced turning on internal magnetic elds

[14]. the mechanism we are proposing shares some properties with this setting, although

supersymmetry is broken at the string scale, but appears to avoid some of its problems,

namely the presence of tachyons and the generic lack of gaugino masses for the unbroken

gauge group.

the rules for constructing perturbative type-i orientifolds [15, 16] rest on the modular

invariance of the closed string spectrum and on some conditions linking its klein-bottle

projection to the open and unoriented sector. these are to be supplemented by ramond-

ramond (rr) tadpole conditions, that are directly related to anomaly cancellations and

may be regarded as global neutrality conditions for rr charges in a compact internal space

[17]. tadpole cancellations result from opposite contributions of boundaries and crosscaps

or, equivalently, of branes and orientifolds.

it is possible to construct models where some of the orientifold contributions are in-

verted, so that the necessary rr cancellations require some care. a simple example of this

phenomenon is aorded by the t 4/z2 orientifold where, compatibly with the crosscap con-

straint [18], all twisted klein-bottle contributions are reversed. these exotic klein-bottle

projections are quite interesting, and have already led to tachyon-free non-supersymmetric

open-string vacua [19]. in our case, the resulting unoriented closed spectrum is supersym-

metric and contains, aside from the (1, 0) gravitational multiplet, 17 tensor multiplets and

4 hypermultiplets, but its rr tadpoles can not be canceled in the usual way. a more

sophisticated, but physically very interesting, set of examples, is provided by the open de-

scendants of z2  z2 models, and in particular of those with discrete torsion, where some
of the orientifold charges are necessarily reversed. in all these cases, the tadpole conditions

may be solved unpairing ns and r contributions, and thus inducing brane supersymmetry

5

breaking.

in this letter, for the sake of brevity, we conne our attention to the t 4/z2

case, where one obtains a chiral 6d spectrum that is free of tachyons and satises all usual

anomaly cancellation constraints. in this model, that contains 32 d9 and 32 anti-d5 branes,

the absence of tachyons can also be understood as in recent studies [20] of stable non-bps

states of the type iib string.

the same mechanism can be applied to the z2  z2 models, that will be discussed
elsewhere, and in principle should oer the possibility to deal with other orientifold models

where tadpole conditions do not admit naive supersymmetric solutions.

a six-dimensional example

we now present an explicit 6d model containing d9 and d5 (anti-d5) branes, where at

tree level supersymmetry breaking is induced on the 55 and 59 states, while the 99 states

and the bulk (closed) spectrum are supersymmetric. the starting point in this construction

is a modication of the  projection in the twisted sector of the t 4/z2 model. this inverts

the charge of the o5 planes, and is actually compatible with the perturbative rules of

orientifold models, but the cancellation of rr tadpoles requires 32 d5 branes. omitting

for brevity the contributions of the transverse bosons, the torus partition function is

turning to the klein bottle, let us consider the two inequivalent choices2

k =

4(cid:26)(qo + qv)(p + w ) + 2  16(qs + qc)(cid:18) 

4(cid:19)2(cid:27) ,

(3)

where p (w ) denotes the momentum (winding) lattice sum and  = 1. for both choices
of , the closed string spectrum has (1, 0) supersymmetry, but the two resulting projections

are quite dierent. the usual choice ( = 1) leaves 1 gravitational multiplet, 1 tensor

multiplet and 20 hypermultiplets, while  = 1 leaves 1 gravitational multiplet, 17 tensor
multiplets and 4 hypermultiplets3. the projected closed spectrum coincides with the one

considered in ref. [21], but our open spectrum is markedly dierent. the transverse-channel

klein bottle amplitude reads

k =

p e

v (cid:19) + 2(qo  qv)(cid:18)2

(cid:27) ,

(4)

where p e (w e) denotes the lattice of even momenta (windings) and v is the volume of the

compact space. the reversal of the o5 charge respects the positivity structure at the origin

of the t 4 lattice, and indeed the coecients combine into perfect squares:

k0 =

25

4 (cid:26)qo(cid:18)v +



v(cid:19)2

+ qv(cid:18)v 



v(cid:19)2(cid:27) .

(5)

the case  = 1 leads to the familiar u(16)  u(16) model [15, 16], and therefore from now
on we restrict our attention to the other choice.

rr tadpole cancellations and the modications of k are compatible with the positivity
of the open spectrum in a, provided one introduces d5 branes, rather than the usual d5
branes. in the transverse channel, this choice inverts the signs of all rr contributions in the

neumann-dirichlet (95) part, but leaves all other untwisted terms unchanged. introducing

suitable chan-paton charges n, d and their z2 orbifold breakings rn , rd, the transverse

annulus amplitude reads

here, for simplicity, all d5 branes, whose geometry is neatly displayed by the breaking

obtained by an s-transformation, and reads

eq. (11) shows some marked dierences with respect to the more familiar model with
 = 1. these may be given a neat physical interpretation, since m describes the propa-
gation between holes and crosscaps, or equivalently between branes and orientifold planes.

therefore, one can see that all d9-o9 terms, the d5-o5 terms in the r-r sector and the

d5-o9 terms in the ns-ns sector are as in the standard t 4/z2 orientifold, while the signs

of all d9-o5 terms, of the d5-o5 terms in the ns-ns sector and of the d5-o9 terms in

the r-r sector are inverted. in particular, this implies that the mobius amplitude breaks

supersymmetry at tree level in the d5 sector, an eect felt by all open-strings ending on

the d5 branes.

finally, a p transformation determines the direct (open string) amplitude

the 99 spectrum is supersymmetric, and comprises the (1,0) vector multiplets for the

so(16)  so(16) gauge group and a hypermultiplet in the representations (16, 16, 1, 1)
of the gauge group. on the other hand, the 55 dd spectrum is not supersymmetric, and

9

contains, aside from the gauge vectors of [usp(16)  usp(16)], quartets of scalars in the
(1, 1, 16, 16), right-handed weyl fermions in the (1, 1, 120, 1) and in the (1, 1, 1, 120), and

left-handed weyl fermions in the (1, 1, 16, 16). finally, the nd sector is also non super-

symmetric, and comprises doublets of scalars in the (16, 1, 1, 16) and in the (1, 16, 16, 1),

together with additional (symplectic) majorana-weyl fermions in the (16, 1, 16, 1) and

(1, 16, 1, 16). these majorana-weyl fermions are a peculiar feature of six-dimensional

space time, where the fundamental weyl fermion, a pseudoreal spinor of su (4), can be

subjected to an additional majorana condition, if this is supplemented by a conjugation in

a pseudoreal representation [23]. in this case, this is indeed possible, since the nd fermions

are valued in the fundamental representation of usp(16). this doubling is also a useful

technical trick in six-dimensional supergravity, where weyl fermions are often extended to

sp(2) majorana-weyl doublets in the (1, 0) case and to sp(4) majorana-weyl quartets in

the (2, 0) case.

it should be appreciated that, from the d9 brane point of view, the diagonal combi-

nation of the two usp(16)5 gauge groups acts as a global symmetry. this corresponds

to having complex scalars and symplectic majorana-weyl fermions in the representations

16  [(16, 1) + (1, 16)] of the d9 gauge group. as a result, the non-superymmetric nd
spectrum looks eectively supersymmetric, and indeed all 95 terms do not contribute to the

vacuum energy. however, as in the 6d temperature breaking discussed in [7], the chirality

of the fermions in q

s is not the one required by 6d supersymmetry. this chirality ip

is a peculiar feature of six-dimensional models, and does not persist in the reduction to

four dimensions 4. thus, in four dimensions supersymmetry would be strictly unbroken on

the d9 branes before turning on d5 gauge interactions. this setting shows some marked

4in view of the present results, the 6d model presented in the rst reference in [7] actually contains, in

addition to the d9 branes, one set of 16 d5 branes and one set of 16 d5 branes. this justies both the

chirality changes in the twisted spectrum of the d5 branes and the presence of the tachyonic mode in the

55 annulus amplitude.

dierences with respect to the mechanism of bulk supersymmetry breaking (or brane su-

persymmetry), where the massless nd sector was supersymmetric from both the n and d

viewpoints [7].

it is easy to check that all the irreducible gauge and gravitational anomalies cancel in

this model as a result of the tadpole conditions for the rr elds. the residual anomaly

polynomial does not factorize, and reveals the need for a generalized green-schwarz mech-

anism [24], with couplings of a more general type than those found in supersymmetric

models:

(15)

brane-antibrane interactions have been discussed recently in the literature in the context

of stable non-bps states [20]. our results for the d9-d5 system, restricted to the open

oriented sector, provide particular examples of type-i vacua including stable non-bps states

with vanishing interaction energy for all radii, as can be seen from the vanishing of the nd

annulus amplitude.

comparing the unoriented closed and open string amplitudes (3), (9) and (12) with

those of the supersymmetric t 4/z2 orientifold, it is easy to see that the former can be

obtained from the latter by a -rotation of the d5 branes together with a reversal of the

charge of the o5 planes. this phenomenon presents some analogies with the deformations

induced by an internal magnetic eld [25] felt only by the d5 branes. this would shift the

oscillator mode numbers of the 55 strings by an amount  = i + j , where

i =

1


arctan(qih)

,

(16)

with qi the charges of the corresponding chan-paton states. in a similar fashion, it would

shift the mode numbers of the 95 strings by  = i , and the mobius contributions by
 = 2i. these oscillator shifts translate into the mass shifts m 2 = (2n + 1)|| + 2sint,

11

where the integer n denotes the landau level and sint denotes the internal spin. as a

result, in a generic magnetic eld the internal components of the higher-dimensional gauge

elds become tachyonic. this is not the only problem presented by type-i strings in mag-

netic elds: rr tadpoles are generally non-vanishing while, from a more phenomenological

perspective, the masses of all the gauginos of the unbroken gauge group, that are neutral

under q, vanish.

our mechanism consists partly of introducing a discrete value i = 1, outside the

physical range of eq.(16). as a result, in the annulus the 99 and 55 contributions are

unaected, while in the 95 terms the internal characters are interchanged, according to

s4  c4 and o4  v4. on the other hand, as we have seen, the modications of the
mobius amplitude are more subtle, due to the simultaneous sign change of the o5 charge,

that results into a symplectic gauge group in the 55 sector with no massless adjoint fermions.

thus, the spectrum is tachyon free, all rr tadpoles are canceled and there are no massless

gauginos.

the breaking of supersymmetry gives rise to a vacuum energy localized on the d5

branes, and thus to a tree-level potential for the n s moduli, that can be extracted from

the corresponding uncancelled ns tadpoles in eqs. (5), (8) and (10). a simple inspection

shows that the only non-vanishing ones correspond to the ns characters v4o4 and o4v4

associated to the 6d dilaton 6 and to the internal volume v:

using factorization and the values n = d = 32 needed to cancel the rr tadpoles, the

potential (in the string frame) is:

,

(18)

where 10 is the 10d dilaton, that determines the yang-mills coupling gym on the d5

branes, and c is some positive numerical constant. the potential (18) is clearly localized

12

on the d5 branes, and is positive. this can be understood noticing that the o9 plane

contribution to vacuum energy, identied from (17), is negative and exactly cancels for

n = 32. this xes the d5 brane contribution to the vacuum energy, that is thus positive,

consistently with the interpretation of this mechanism as global supersymmetry breaking.

the potential (18) has the usual runaway behavior, as expected by general arguments.

an interesting application of the above mechanism is to the z2  z2 orbifold model
with discrete torsion, where nontrivial two-form uxes at the orbifold xed points [26]

invert the sign of the lattice independent terms in the torus amplitude. it is interesting

to notice that the corresponding supersymmetric spectra, which contain chiral fermions,

are inconsistent because of uncancelled rr tadpoles. the solution to the rr tadpoles can

again be obtained introducing anti-d5 branes, along the lines described previously. we

have worked out in detail the partition functions and the spectra of the open descendants,

that will be presented elsewhere. here we conclude by describing some qualitative features

of the resulting models. the o5i plane charges, manifest in the klein bottle amplitude, are

equal to 32i, where the signs i = 1 are restricted by 123 = 1. there are thus four
independent possibilities, (1, 2, 3) = (1,1,1), (1, 1, 1), (1,1, 1) and (1, 1,1). as
in the 6d model discussed in the present paper, every o5i charge ip i = 1 will ask
for a set of 32 d5i branes. moreover, in this case the d5i gauge group becomes unitary,

whereas for i = 1 it is symplectic as in the supersymmetric model without discrete torsion.

however, the gauginos of unitary groups are massless, and can acquire masses only through

quantum corrections. indeed, in our 6d example the gauginos were massive because the

mobius amplitude had dierent projections for bosons and fermions. on the other hand,

the adjoint representation for unitary groups is not aected by the mobius amplitude, and

therefore the corresponding gauginos stay massless. the d9 gauge group changes too: it

is so(8)4

9 for (1, 2, 3) = (1,1,1) and u(8)2

9 for the other 3 choices. supersymmetry

is broken at the string scale in the sectors 95i and in the dirichlet part of the mobius

amplitude, in analogy with the 6d model described here. moreover, if i = 1 and j = 1

supersymmetry is also broken in the sector 5i5j, where a tachyon appears, in agreement

with the analysis of non-bps states of [20]. finally, the remaining ns-ns tadpoles give

rise to a scalar potential localized on the anti-d5 branes, as in eq. (18).

it would be interesting to investigate along the same lines other models, as the 4d z4

orientifold, where the tadpole conditions have no naive solution.
