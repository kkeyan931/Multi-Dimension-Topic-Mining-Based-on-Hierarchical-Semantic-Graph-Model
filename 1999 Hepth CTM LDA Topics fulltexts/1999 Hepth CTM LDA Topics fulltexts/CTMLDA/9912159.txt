(4.2) (4.3) note that, since assuming q1 and/or q2 vanish, constants (4.2) generically well dened. clear (4.2) quantization conditions charges q1, q2, p1, p2 break sl(2, r) sl(2, z)  (for xed asympotic values scalar elds).equation (4.2) provides sl(2, z) parameters relating two components 5 multiplet. since started four equations ((3.7) (3.8)) three unknowns (a, c d), also get constraint equation qi, pi, , , satisfy: e(q2 q1)2 + eq1 2 = e (p2 p1)2 + e p1 2. (4.4) interpretation constraint clear follows. killing spinors straightforwardly computed using equations (3.10), (3.9) (4.2). lets us work specic example. take bps ns5-brane einstein frame: ds2 e = h(r) 1 e = ph(r), 4 (dt2 + dx 2 k ) + h(r) h (1) = 2r23, h(r) harmonic function: h(r) = 1 + r2 r2 , 3 4 (dr2 + r2d3) h (2) = = 0, (4.5) (4.6) construct sl(2, z) multiplet belongs, corresponding killing spinors (this multiplet rst constructed ). take, moreover, asymptotic conditions, 0 () (4.6) already taken 0 () = 0 0 () = 0). equation (4.4) obtain, case: 0 () (note 2 = e q1 0 (p2 p1 0)2 + e 0 p1 2 (4.7) allows eliminate q1 equations (4.2) write terms p1 p2 alone. gives: (4.8) (4.9) = b = c = = 1 q1 p2 q1 1 q1 p1 q1  e 0 (p1 0 p2) . plugging result (3.7) (3.8) get sl(2, z) multiplet: e = c2h(r) 1 2 + d2h(r) 1 2 = ac + bdh(r) c2 + d2h(r) h (1) h (2) = dh (1) = bh (1). 6 einstein metric inert u (1) transformations (see equation (2.2)), meaning mass measured equal members multiplet. coecient r harmonic form invariant. using (4.7), written terms charges p1, p2: q1 = z h (1) = 2r2w3 r2 (p1,p2) r2 = qe 0 (p2 p1 2w3 0)2 + e 0 p1 2 , (4.10) denoted w3 volume unit s3. usually, charges given units q1 = 1. ns5-brane d5-brane (1, 0) (0, 1) elements multiplet (p1, p2) magnetic 5-branes. let us compute killing spinors. present case, function depends r written terms charges p1 p2 equations (4.8) as: sin (p1,p2)(r) = cos (p1,p2)(r) = e 0 (p1 0 p2) 0 p2)2 + p2 qe2 0 (p1 1h(r) 1 2 p1 0 p2)2 + p2 . 1h(r) qe2 0 (p1 (4.11) now, using equation (3.10), killing spinor (p1, p2) magnetic 5-brane obtained ns5-brane as: (p1,p2) = e 2 (p1,p2 )(r) n s5, n s5 =  1 16 e 3 2 3 r e 2 2 23 e 1 2 1 2 0 0 constant complex weyl spinor negative chirality satisfying: 0123450 = 0.

(4.16) case, writing modied einstein metric associated metric equation (4.5), get: g00 1 + 1 4 gsr2 p r2 (4.17) (4.18) comparing (4.16) (4.17), using equation (4.10), arrive at: = 3 84qg2 (p2 p1 0)2 + g4 p2 1. note adm mass units mass per unit brane volume (1/(lenght6)), corresponds tensions (p1, p2) branes. note also p1 charged objects contribute mass terms order p1/g2 (as corresponds magnetic ns brane) whereas p2 charged objects contribute mass term order p2/gs (as corresponds d-branes solitons). then, (4.9) describes background congurations corresponding bound states solitonic 5-branes d5-branes . 5. electric multiplets. let us consider cases least one non-vanishing electric charge. electric case, conserved charges given equations motion ns-ns r-r potentials b c: dened s(1) = s(2) = 0, s(1) eh (1) ef s(2) ef. then, dene electric charges as: qi = z s(i), pi = z s(i) , (5.1) (5.2) (5.3) integration region surrounds charged object. equations (3.7) (3.8) work transformations laws s(1) s(2) local u (1) transformations. result following: s(1) s(2) = as(1) bs(2) = cs(1) + ds(2), 8 (5.4) i.e., using (5.3): p1 = aq1 bq2 p2 = cq1 + dq2. (5.5) note that, compared (3.8), magnetic charges transforms sl(2, z) matrix k, electric charges transforms (k 1)t . comparing (5.4) (3.8) see that, electric case, make changes q1 q2, q2 q1, p1 p2 p2 p1 equations (4.2),(4.3)and (4.4)4. changes give, sl(2, z) constants, expressions: = b = c = = 1 1 1 1 given by:  0 0 + e0 0) + (q2 1e0 p2 1e 0 )] , q2 p2(e constraint (4.4) reads: 0 0 + e0 0) + (q2 p1e 0 + q1 p2e0 ) e(q1 + q2)2 + e q2 2 = e (p1 + p2)2 + e p2 2. (5.6) (5.7) (5.8) killing spinors computed using equations (3.10), (3.9), (5.6). let us work explicit example (). take bps fundamental string einstein frame : e = h(r) 3 ds2 e = ph(r), 4 (dt2 + dx 2 1 ) + h(r) 1 4 (dr2 + r2d7) e h (1) = 6r67, h (2) = = 0, h(r) harmonic function: r6 r6 . take, moreover, asymptotic conditions h(r) = 1 + equation (5.8) gives, case: 0 () 0 (). 1 = e q2 0 (p1 + p2 0)2 + e 0 p2 2. 4 nothing electric-magnetic duality h (1) s(2), h (2) s(1). 9 (5.9) (5.10) (5.11) use equation eliminate q1 equations (5.6) write (5.6) terms p1 p2 alone (q1 given (5.11) terms p1 p2) . gives: = b = p1 q1 1 q1  p2 c = q1 e q1 = 0 (p2 0 + p1). (5.12) again, plugging background conguration (3.7) (3.8) get sl(2, z) multiplet: e = c2h(r) 1 2 + d2h(r) 1 2 = ach(r) + bd c2h(r) + d2 h (1) h (2) = dh (1) = bh (1). coecient r harmonic form given, using (5.11), by: q1 = z s(1) = 6r6w7 r6 (p1, p2) r6 = qe 0 (p1 + p2 6w7 0)2 + e 0 p2 2 (5.13) , (5.14) denoted w7 volume unit s7. equation (5.8) interpre- tated, again, equating masses (more properly, tensions) components sl(2, z) multiplet measured einstein metric. obtain killing spinor (p1, p2) strings equation (3.10): (p1, p2) = e 2 ( p1, p2 )(r)f 1, (5.15) (p1, p2)(r) given case by: sin (p1, p2)(r) = cos (p1, p2)(r) = p2 1 2 qe2 qe2 0(p2 0 + p1)2 + p2 2h(r) e 0 (p2 0 + p1) , 0 (p2 0 + p1)2 + p2 2h(r) 10 (5.16) f 1 killing spinor fundamental (1, 0) string: f 1 =  3 16 e 7 2 7 r e i+1 2 ii+1 0. 6 yi=1 (5.17) equation, angles transverse s7 product taken right left. 0 constant weyl spinor satisfying: 010 = 0 (5.18) now, compute adm masses electric multiplet modied einstein frame similarly calculation masses magnetic multiplets previous section. comparing g00 1 + gn 7w7 r6 .

(5.20) (5.21) note adm mass units mass per unit brane volume (1/(lenght2)), corresponds tensions (p1, p2) strings. note also p1 charged objects contribute mass terms order p1 (as corresponds perturbative string modes) whereas p2 charged objects contribute mass term order p2/gs (as corresponds d-brane solitons). thus, background (5.13) corresponds bound states fundamental strings d1-branes . 6. conclusions discussion. equations motion type iib supergravity exactly map equations type iib string theory identications (3.1). s-duality symmetry type iib string theory corresponds u (1) local transformations type iib supergravity (2.2) mantaining reality gauge (3.1). sl(2, z) multiplets associated solutions type iib string theory considered here, given (3.7) (3.8), sl(2, z) constants xed expectation values scalars electric magnetic charges (4.2) (5.6). killing spinors sl(2, z) multiplets computed (3.10). approach, self-duality d3 branes reected fact supergravity ve-form neutral u (1) transformations. moreover, killing spinors 11 associated d3 multiplets related global rotations (see equations (3.9) (3.10)), due constant nature scalars solutions. checked general expressions previously constructed sl(2, z) multiplets solitonic brane () fundamental string () belong, ob- taining result.   dierent approach particular cases employed. particular, eintein metric invariant sl(2, z) transfor- mation harmonic form coecients (4.10) (5.14) found rescaling due charge quantization arguments. words, solution eective iib equa- tions motion used construct multiplet multiplet. approach, harmonic form coecient xed consistency constraint (4.4) einstein metric invariant. moreover, provided relation members multiplet (4.2) (5.6). sl(2, z) multiplet containing given representative least one non- vanishing charge (electric magnetic) associated ns-ns r-r three forms straightforwardly constructed formalism. however, cover exotic solutions d-instantons () d7-branes (). solutions charged respect three forms (or duals) appearing theory. d-instantons, one adapt formalism euclidean space. d7 case subtle one. background solution magnetically charged respect one-form r-r eld strenght (which, course, globally dened). means eld single-valued along one-cycles surrounding brane. can, case, cover cycle two charts. inside chart single-valued, apply (3.6) safely. sl(2, z) transformations performed charts are, however, independent. demand equality overlapping regions (i.e., eld strenghts globally dened). dicult (3.6) show sl(2, z) transformations preserving single-valued character one form eld strenghts associated potentials c = 0, change magnetic charge associated expectation values scalar elds. transformations c 6= 0 lead non single-valued eld strenghts. suggests bound states d7 branes absent . acknowledgements grateful j. edelstein, a. v. ramallo j. sanchez guillen useful discussions comments. work supported part dgicyt grant pb96-0960 european union tmr grant erbfmrxct960012. 12 references  j.h. schwarz, nucl. phys. b226(1983) 269-288.  b. de wit, d.j. smit n.d. hari dass, nucl. phys. b283(1987) 165-191.  a. font, l. ibanez, d. lust f. quevedo, phys. lett. b249 (1990) 35.  j. h. schwarz, phys. lett. b360(1995)13; erratum-ibid. b364(1995)252, hep-th/9508143.  j.x. lu s. roy, phys. lett. b428(1998)289, hep-th/9802080.  s.f. hassan, hep-th/9907152.  t. ortn, phys. rev. d51(1995)790, hep-th/9404035.  y. imamura, nucl. phys. b537(1999) 184, hep-th/9807179.  c. hull p. townsend, nucl. phys. b438 (1995) 109, hep-th/9410167.  h. lu, c.m. pope j.rahmfeld, hep-th/9805151.  juan m. maldacena, ph. thesis, hep-th 9607235.  r.c. myers m.j. perry, ann. phys. 172 (1986) 304.  e. witten, nucl. phys. b460(1996)335, hep-th/9510135.  g. horowitz a. strominger, nucl. phys. b360(1991) 197.  g.w. gibbons, m.b. green m.j. perry, phys. lett. b370(1996)37, hep-th/9511080.  a. dabholkar, lectures orientifolds hep-th/9804208
