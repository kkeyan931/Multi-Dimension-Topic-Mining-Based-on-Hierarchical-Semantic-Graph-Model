abstract

in this note we discuss dynamical mechanisms for brane stabilization in the
brane world context.
in particular, we consider supersymmetry preserving
brane stabilization, and also brane stabilization accompanied by supersymme-
try breaking. these mechanisms are realized in some four dimensional n = 1
supersymmetric orientifold models. for illustrative purposes we consider two
explicit orientifold models previously constructed in [1].
in both of these
models branes are stabilized at a nite distance from the orientifold planes.
in the rst model brane stabilization occurs via supersymmetry preserving
non-perturbative gauge dynamics.
in the second model supersymmetry is
dynamically broken, and brane stabilization is due to an interplay between
non-perturbatively generated superpotential and tree-level kahler potential.

the discovery of d-branes [2] is likely to have important phenomenological implications.
thus, the standard model gauge and matter elds may live inside of p  9 spatial dimen-
sional p-branes, while gravity lives in a larger (10 or 11) dimensional bulk of the space-time.
this brane world picture1 a priori appears to be a viable scenario, and, based on consid-
erations of gauge and gravitational coupling unication, dilaton stabilization and weakness
of the standard model gauge couplings, in [9] it was actually argued to be a likely descrip-
tion of nature. in particular, these phenomenological constraints seem to be embeddable in
the brane world scenario (with the standard model elds living on branes with 3 < p < 9),
which therefore might provide a coherent picture for describing our universe [9]. this is
largely due to a much higher degree of exibility of the brane world scenario compared with,
say, the old perturbative heterotic framework.

an important question arising in the brane world context is the issue of brane stabiliza-
tion. in particular, in many four dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric type i/type i vacua
there are at directions corresponding to the positions of branes either with respect to each
other or to the orientifold planes. perturbatively, therefore, branes are not stabilized in such
vacua. upon supersymmetry breaking we might generically expect brane stabilization to
occur. however, brane stabilization can sometimes occur via supersymmetry preserving non-
perturbative dynamics. the purpose of this note is to illustrate some possible mechanisms
of brane stabilization in the brane world context. in particular, brane stabilization in the
mechanisms we discuss here is due to non-perturbative gauge dynamics in the world-volume
of the branes, and can be supersymmetry preserving as well as supersymmetry breaking
dynamics.
in the latter case the vev of the eld whose f-term breaks supersymmetry
is precisely the inter-brane distance or the distance between the branes and an orientifold
plane. for illustrative purposes we present explicit string models where these mechanisms
are realized. these examples, which are consistent string vacua (with four non-compact
and six compact space-time dimensions) satisfying the requirements of tadpole and anomaly
cancellation, were originally constructed in [1], and here we briey review these construc-
in particular, the models we consider in this paper are four dimensional n = 1
tions.
supersymmetric orientifolds with non-trivial ns-ns b-ux.
here we should emphasize that in the following discussions we will assume that dilaton is
somehow stabilized via some other dynamics whose relevant scale is higher than the strong
scale of the gauge dynamics responsible for brane stabilization. we can then safely integrate
dilaton out and consider brane stabilization for a xed gauge coupling determined by the
dilaton vev. on the other hand, if dilaton stabilization is not achieved, one runs into
the usual runaway problem - the ground state of the theory is located at innitely weak
coupling where branes are destabilized and supersymmetry is restored (in the cases where
brane stabilization is accompanied by supersymmetry breaking). the examples we discuss in
this note, therefore, should only be understood as illustrative (toy) representatives of n = 1
gauge theories (arising from consistent string vacua) where non-perturbative dynamics can
stabilize the vev of a eld which in the brane world context is interpreted as measuring
the separation between branes or branes and orientifold planes.

1for recent developments, see, e.g., [39]. the brane world picture in the eective eld theory
context was discussed in [10].

let us begin our discussion with the case where brane stabilization is accompanied by
supersymmetry breaking. thus, consider an n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theory with
su(4) gauge group and matter consisting of one chiral supereld  transforming in the
two-index antisymmetric irrep 6 of su(4). note that this theory is anomaly free. there is a
at direction in this theory along which  acquires a vev as follows: hi = diag(x, x),
where   i2 is a 2 2 antisymmetric matrix (2 is a pauli matrix). the gauge group along
this at direction is broken down to sp(4)  so(5), and the only matter left is a singlet of
sp(4) (which is precisely the chiral supereld acquiring the vev x). thus, below the mass
scale x we have pure n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theory with the gauge group sp(4) plus
the singlet.
supersymmetry in this model is actually broken. in fact, this is already the case in the
context of global supersymmetry. the reason for this is that the gaugino condensate in the
sp(4) gauge theory depends non-trivially on x. this can be seen as follows. the gauge
coupling running starts at the string scale ms (which we will identify as the uv cut-o of
the theory). between the scales ms and x (where we assume x  ms) the gauge coupling
of the su(4) gauge theory runs with the one-loop -function coecient b0 = 11. below the
mass scale x the gauge coupling of the sp(4) gauge theory runs with the one-loop -function

coecienteb0 = 9. matching the two gauge couplings at the scale x then gives the following
strong scale e of the sp(4) theory:

e = b0/eb0x 1b0/eb0 = 11/9x 2/9 ,

where   ms exp(2s/b0) is the strong scale of the original su(4) gauge theory. (here
s  4/g2 + i/2 is the dilaton vev which determines the su(4) gauge coupling g at the
string scale as well as the vacuum angle .) the gaugino condensation in the sp(4) theory
generates the following superpotential2

(1)

(2)

w = 3e3 = 311/3x 2/3 .

note that this superpotential has runaway behavior in x so that for any nite x supersym-
metry is broken. in the context of global supersymmetry the vacuum is located at innite
x where supersymmetry is restored. in the locally supersymmetric context, however, the
situation is quite dierent.

the key point here is the following. thus, as was pointed out in [11], once such a theory
with a runaway direction is coupled to supergravity, generically there is a natural shut-down
scale for runaway directions, namely, the planck scale. more precisely, this is the case for
a certain large class of kahler potentials, which, in particular, includes kahler potentials of
minimal type. local supersymmetry breaking and stabilization of the runaway directions

2note that for a pure n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theory with a simple gauge group g the
non-perturbative superpotential generated by the gaugino condensation (in the dr subtraction
scheme) is given by w = hg3
g, where hg is the dual coxeter number of the group g (hg = n
for g = su (n ), hg = n  2 for g = so(n ), hg = n + 1 for g = sp(2n ), and in our
conventions sp(2n ) has rank n ), and g  exp(2s/b0(g)) is the strong scale of the theory
(here b0(g) = 3hg).

is then due to the interplay between non-perturbatively generated runaway superpotential
and tree-level kahler potential.

let us illustrate the above point by considering a theory in which there is a runaway
superpotential w = c/x  generated via some non-perturbative dynamics. let us assume
that the kahler potential for x is minimal: k = xx . for simplicity in the following we
will adapt the units where the reduced planck scale mp = 1/8gn is set to one, so that
the scalar potential reads:

where the f-term fx = wx + kxw . let   xx . then we have
1! .

xx |fx|2  3|w|2(cid:17) ,

v = ek(cid:16)k 1
v () = |c|2e  2

(3)

(4)

the extrema of this scalar potential are located at 0 =  and  =  + 1   + 1. here

we are assuming that  > 0. then the extremum at  = 0 corresponds to a supersymmetric
maximum with vanishing f-term. the extrema at  =  correspond to minima with broken
supersymmetry. thus, in such a theory x is indeed stabilized and supersymmetry is broken.
note that in the runaway superpotential in (2) generated in the su(4) gauge theory with
one chiral 6 which we discussed above we have  = 2/3.

note, however, that the superpotential (2) is only valid for x  ms, whereas the above
minima correspond to the values of x  mp (here we can assume for simplicity that the
reduced planck scale and the string scale are of the same order of magnitude). so, strictly
speaking, the above quantitative analysis is not valid. however, the qualitative conclusion
that x is stabilized and supersymmetry is broken is still correct. the reason for this is the
following. note that for x  ms we would have pure sp(4) super-yang-mills theory below
the cut-o scale ms. then the superpotential generated in this case would be independent
of x: w = 3e3, where e  ms exp(2s/eb0). the corresponding scalar potential (in the

assumption of the minimal kahler potential) is then given by3

v () = |w|2e(  3) .

(5)

this scalar potential can be seen to stabilize  at  = 2, where the f-term is non-zero,
hence supersymmetry breaking. for intermediate values of x (that is, x  ms), the
superpotential is a non-trivial function of x interpolating between  x 2/3 for small x
and a constant for large x. (this interpolating function depends on the details of various
threshold corrections around the scale ms.) from the limiting behavior, however, it is clear
that x is stabilized and supersymmetry is broken (subject to the appropriate assumptions

3here we should point out that for x  ms we must also take into account the fact that
generically dilaton may not be constant, but vary logarithmically in the two transverse directions
corresponding to the motion of the branes. this would modify the x dependence in v , but it is
not dicult to see that the qualitative conclusions on brane stabilization at x  ms would still
remain correct.

on the kahler potential). as we have already mentioned, in the following we will present an
explicit string model whose low energy eective eld theory contains the su(4) gauge theory
with one chiral 6 discussed above, and where the vev x is identied with the separation
between d-branes and the corresponding orientifold plane.

next, we would like to discuss an example where brane stabilization occurs via supersym-
metry preserving dynamics. thus, consider an n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theory with
su(4)  su(4) gauge group and matter consisting of one chiral supereld  transforming
in (10, 1) of su(4)  su(4), one chiral supereld q transforming in (4, 4), and one chiral
supereld eq transforming in (4, 4). note that this theory is anomaly free. we will assume
that there is a tree-level superpotential given by

wtree = qeq ,

(6)

where  is the corresponding yukawa coupling. there are three at directions in this model.
one corresponds to the eld q acquiring a non-zero vev. the gauge group along the at
direction hqi 6= 0 is broken down to su(4)diag  su(4) su(4). after the gauge symmetry
breaking we have a singlet of su(4)diag coming from q, and also one chiral 6 of su(4)diag
coming from eq. the rest of the elds in q are eaten in the super-higgs mechanism, whereas
the rest of the elds in eq pair up with those in  and become heavy via the corresponding

coupling in the tree-level superpotential (6). thus, along this at direction we have the
su(4) gauge theory with one chiral 6 plus a singlet. this is the same theory as that already
discussed above except for the presence of the extra singlet. one can analyze this case in a
similar fashion, however, and it is not dicult to see that vev stabilization is accompanied
by supersymmetry breaking just as in the previous case. note that the second at direction

along which heqi 6= 0 gives rise to the same theory as above.
in the following we will therefore be interested in the third at direction along which
hi = diag(x, x, x, x) and the gauge group is broken down to so(4)  su(4). the only
matter left is a singlet (coming from ) which is precisely the chiral supereld acquiring the
vev x. the rest of the elds in  are eaten in the super-higgs mechanism, and the elds

q, eq acquire mass x due to the corresponding coupling in the tree-level superpotential
(6). thus, at low energies we have gaugino condensates in both so(4)  su(2)  su(2)
and su(4) subgroups. matching the gauge couplings of [su(2)  su(2)]  su(4) with the
original gauge couplings of su(4)  su(4) at the corresponding threshold scales, we obtain
the following non-perturbative superpotential on this branch of the classical moduli space
(here we assume that gauge couplings of both su(4) subgroups are the same at the string
scale):

w = 24x 25 + 4x()2 ,

(7)

where   ms exp(2s/b0), and   ms exp(2s/b
0 = 8 are the
one-loop -function coecients of the rst respectively second su(4) subgroups above the
corresponding threshold scales.

0). here b0 = 5 and b

in fact, we can generalize the above model as follows. thus, consider an n = 1 su-
persymmetric gauge theory with su(m)  su(n) gauge group and matter consisting of
one chiral supereld  transforming in (r, 1) of su(m)  su(n), one chiral supereld q
transforming in (m, n), and one chiral supereld eq transforming in (m, n). here r = s

5

for  = +1, and r = a for  = 1, where s is the two-index symmetric (m(m + 1)/2 di-
mensional) representation of su(m), while a is the two-index antisymmetric (m(m  1)/2
dimensional) representation of su(m). anomaly cancellation requires that m = 2n  4.
we will assume that there is a tree-level superpotential given by (6). along the at direction
hi 6= 0 the gauge group is broken down to g(m)  su(n), where g(m) = so(m) for
 = +1, and g(m) = sp(m) for  = 1. the only matter left is a singlet coming from .
the gaugino condensation in both g(m) and su(n) subgroups gives rise to the following
non-perturbative superpotential:

w = c(n, )

n

n 3 x  n 2

n 3 

4n 11

n 3 + n(x)2

4

n ()1+ 4

n ,

(8)

where 4n 11  ms exp(2s), and ()n +4  ms exp(2s) (and we are assuming
that gauge couplings of both su(m) and su(n) are the same at the string scale). here
c(n, ) = n3 except when n = 4,  = +1. in the latter case g(m) = so(4)  su(2)
su(2) (that is, g(m) is not simple), and c(n, ) = 2 (instead of 1) as we have to add the
contributions of gaugino condensates in both su(2) subgroups. (here we are assuming that
the phases of the gaugino condensates are the same for both su(2) subgroups.) we note
that in deriving the superpotential (8) some care is needed. in particular, for  = 1 we
have the breaking su(m)  sp(m), and the sp(m) gauge coupling at the scale x is the
same as that of su(m). however, for  = +1 we have the breaking su(m)  so(m), and
the so(m) gauge coupling eg(x) at the scale x is related to the su(m) gauge coupling
g(x) at the same scale via 2eg2(x) = g2(x). this is due to the special embedding of so(m)

into su(m). (thus, in the perturbative heterotic language so(m) in this case is realized
via a level-2 current algebra.) in particular, this is important in obtaining the correct powers
of x and  as well as the numerical coecient c(n, ) in the rst term in (8).

let us go back to the non-perturbative superpotential (7) in the su(4) su(4) example
discussed above. let us rst consider the globally supersymmetric setup. the f-term of x
vanishes for

x =   5

()2!1/3

= ms exp(s/2) .

(9)

for a large enough dilaton vev s (that is, for small enough gauge coupling at the string
scale4) we have x  ms, so that the above quantitative analysis is valid in the globally
supersymmetric context. that is, the vev x is stabilized via supersymmetry preserving
dynamics. here we would like to address the issue of whether the same is true once we
couple this system to supergravity.

to answer the above question, consider a generic system of superelds i with the super-
potential w . let k(, ) be the kahler potential, which we will assume to be non-singular

4note that large s in our conventions does not necessarily imply weak string coupling. thus, as
was pointed out in [9], the string coupling can be of order 1, while the gauge coupling (at the string
scale) of a gauge theory arising from a set of p-branes compactied on a p  3 dimensional space
can be small if the corresponding compactication volume vp3 is large in the string units. this
volume is absorbed in the above denition of the dilaton vev s.

for non-zero nite values of i. the scalar potential is given by (once again, here we set the
reduced planck scale mp to one):

v = ek(cid:16)gijfi(fj)  3w w (cid:17) ,

(10)

where the summation over repeated indices is understood, gij  k 1
kahler metric, fi  wi + kiw are the f-terms for the elds i, and wi  w/i.
note that if all of the f-terms fi are vanishing, local supersymmetry is unbroken. it is
easy to verify that a point with fi  0 corresponds to an extremum of the scalar potential.
(in this case vi = vi = 0.) we would like to investigate the conditions under which this
extremum is actually a local minimum of the scalar potential. to do this we need the
following quantities evaluated at the point fi  0:

is the inverse of the

ij

vij = ekfijw  ,
vij = ekhgij fii(fj j)  2kijw w i .

(11)

(12)

here fij  (fi)j = wij + (kij  kikj)w . note that if, say, the absolute values of all the
eigenvalues of the matrix wij are much larger5 than |w| at the point fi  0, then this point
corresponds to a local minimum of the scalar potential6.
the above discussion has the following implications for the fate of globally supersym-
metric minima corresponding to the superpotential w in the local supergravity context.
suppose the f-atness conditions wi = 0 in the global setting have a solution with all the
vevs stabilized at i = (0)
. furthermore, suppose that the eigenvalues of the matrix
i
wij((0)) are all non-zero, and their absolute values are much larger than |w ((0))|. then
in the vicinity of the point (0)
i which is a locally supersym-
metric minimum of the scalar potential (10). the proof of this statement is very simple.
first, the f-atness conditions in the local setting are given by wi() = ki(, )w ().
since wij((0)) is non-singular, these equations have a solution at i = (1)
, where
i

i = (0)
)w ((0)) + o(2), and  << 1 is the absolute value
of the largest eigenvalue of the matrix mij((0))w ((0)), where mij((0)) is the matrix in-
verse to wij((0)). moreover, according to our discussion above, the point (1)
corresponds
i
to a local minimum. here we note that the physical reason for this is clear - since in the
globally supersymmetric setup all the elds are heavy at the minimum, there is no gold-
stino candidate required for local supersymmetry breaking once we couple the system to
supergravity.

let us now go back to the superpotential (7), and see whether the aforementioned con-

ditions are satised at the global minimum given by (9). thus, we have

5one can easily write down the precise condition for the minimum which does not require the
absolute values of the eigenvalues of the matrix wij be much larger than |w|, but satisfy certain
inequalities.

6here we assume that the kahler potential and its derivatives are of order 1 or smaller at i = (0)
which is usually the case.

(13)

here we are using the mp = 1 units, and we are assuming that the yukawa coupling is of
order of the gauge coupling at the string scale: ||  g. thus, in this model the vev x is
indeed stabilized without supersymmetry breaking, and the stabilized value of x is much
smaller than ms (for large enough values of s).

next, as we promised in the beginning, we are going to give the explicit string construc-
tion of the above models. in fact, these models were already constructed in [1] where a more
detailed discussion can be found. here we will briey review the construction in [1], and
identify various at directions in the classical moduli space with the motion of d-branes in
the corresponding transverse directions.

consider type i compactied on the following orbifold calabi-yau three-fold with su(3)
holonomy: m3  (t 2  t 2  t 2)/(z3  z3). let g1 and g2 be the generators of the two
z3 subgroups. their action on the complex coordinates z1, z2, z3 parametrizing the three
two-tori is given by:

g1z1 = z1 ,
g2z1 = z1 ,

g1z2 = 1z2 ,

g2z2 = z2 ,

g1z3 = z3 ,
g2z3 = 1z3 .

(14)
(15)

here   exp(2i/3). this calabi-yau three-fold has the hodge numbers (h1,1, h2,1) =
(84, 0), so there are 84 chiral supermultiplets in the closed string sector. in the open string
sector we have d9-branes only whose number depends on the rank b of the ns-ns b-eld
bij (i, j = 1, . . . , 6 label the real compact directions corresponding to complex coordinates
z1, z2, z3). note that since bij is antisymmetric, b can only take even values 0, 2, 4, 6. the
untwisted tadpole cancellation conditions then imply that we have 25b/2 d9-branes [12]. in
the following we are going to be interested in the cases b = 2 and b = 4.

 b = 2. we have 16 d9-branes. the orientifold projection is of the sp type. the
solution to the twisted tadpole cancellation conditions (up to equivalent representations) is
given by7 [1]:

g1,9 = diag(i4, 1i4) ,
g2,9 = diag(i2, i2, 1i2, i2) .

(16)
(17)

here we have chosen b12 = 1/2, b34 = b56 = 0. the gauge group is u(4)  u(4). the
matter consists of the following chiral superelds:  = (10, 1)(+2, 0), q = (4, 4)(1, +1),
eq = (4, 4)(1,1), where the u(1) charges are given in parentheses. the tree-level super-
potential, which can be derived using the standard techniques, reads:

note that this is precisely the second model discussed above except for the extra u(1)s.
in fact, the rst u(1) is anomalous. it is broken by vevs of some of the twisted closed

w = qeq .

(18)

7here we work with 24b/2  24b/2 (rather than 25b/2  25b/2) chan-paton matrices as we
choose not to count the orientifold images of the corresponding d-branes.

8

string sector chiral multiplets which transform non-linearly under the anomalous u(1). the
second u(1) is anomaly free, and it is not dicult to see that it has no eect on the above
discussion of vev stabilization.

note that in the above construction we have d9-branes. we can t-dualize to arrive at the
corresponding type i vacuum with, say, d3-branes. then the space transverse to d3-branes
is m3. the point in the moduli space with the unbroken gauge group corresponds to the
brane conguration where all d3-branes are sitting on top of the corresponding orientifold
plane. the at directions along which hi 6= 0, heqi 6= 0 and hqi 6= 0 then correspond
to the branes moving o the orientifold plane in the z1, z2 and z3 directions, respectively.
thus, if  6= 0 then motion in the z2, z3 directions is not allowed due to the corresponding
f-atness conditions implied by the superpotential (18). on the other hand, as we have
discussed above, the vev of  is stabilized via supersymmetry preserving non-perturbative
dynamics on this branch of the classical moduli space, so that d3-branes are stabilized at a
nite distance from the orientifold plane.

 b = 4. we have 8 d9-branes. the orientifold projection is of the so type. the solution

to the twisted tadpole cancellation conditions is given by [1] :

g1,9 = i4 ,
g2,9 = diag(i2, 1i2) .

(19)
(20)

here we have chosen b12 = b34 = 1/2, b56 = 0. the gauge group is u(4). the matter
consists of one chiral supereld  = 6(+2). note that we have anomalous u(1) in this model
which is broken by vevs of the corresponding twisted closed string sector chiral multiplets.
note that there are no renormalizable couplings in this case. this model is then the same
as the rst model we discussed above. once we t-dualize so that we have d3- instead of
d9-branes, the motion of d3-branes in the z3 direction is described by the  vev. note
that d3-branes are frozen in the z1, z2 directions as the corresponding moduli are absent.
as we saw above, the vev of  in this model is stabilized via supersymmetry breaking
non-perturbative dynamics, so that d3-branes are stabilized at a nite distance from the
orientifold plane.

here we should point out that the above open string spectra correspond to perturbative
(from the orientifold viewpoint) sectors. however, unlike in some other cases (examples of
which were recently discussed in [13]), non-perturbative orientifold sector states in these
models become heavy and decouple once we blow up the orbifold singularities (which is
required to break anomalous u(1)s) along the lines of [14].

before we nish this note, we would like to make a few comments. first, it would be
interesting to see whether in models of this type log-like corrections to the kahler potential
could stabilize branes at distances large compared with the string length along the lines of
[15]. also, the above discussion assumed dilaton stabilization.
in a more realistic setup
dilaton would have to be stabilized via the standard race-track mechanism [16], or via a
quantum modication of the moduli space [17], or else via some other mechanism. it would
be interesting to understand these issues more explicitly in the brane world context (for a
general discussion see [9]).

finally, we should point out that brane stabilization mechanisms similar to those dis-
cussed above were considered in [18] in the non-compact context where gravity decouples

9

from the gauge theory dynamics. here we consider consistent compact tadpole-free orien-
tifold models. brane stabilization in the latter context was also discussed in [19], where
branes were argued to be stabilized via an interplay between non-perturbatively generated
superpotential and an anomalous u(1). however, as we have mentioned above, anomalous
u(1)s in the orientifold vacua are generically broken by vevs of the corresponding twisted
closed string sector chiral multiplets, which ameliorates the eect of the anomalous u(1)s
leaving behind the usual non-perturbative runaway superpotential (as in the rst model
discussed in this note).
