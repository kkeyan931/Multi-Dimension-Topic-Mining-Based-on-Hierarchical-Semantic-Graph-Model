(4.2) (4.4) operators q(1) commute local operators a(1), namely dieos b. must true since action mapping class group cannot change c 21 {$9906174$}. one make 3 large, dehn twists b act 3. see fig. 3.1 fig. 3.2. fact, one verify aq(1) c a1 = bq(1) c b1 = q(1) c . (4.5) let us call d(1) a(1) algebra generated q(1) g . clear d(1) isomorphic drinfeld quantum double d(h) = f (h) c(h). consequence, d(1) structure quasi-triangular hopf algebra . paper interested mostly two properties quasi-triangular hopf algebra, namely existence co-product universal r matrix. c (1) co-product d(1) linear map co-associative, morphism algebras, : d(1) d(1) d(1) , ( id) = (id ) , (a b) = (a) (b) . quantum double, co-product expressions (q(1) c ) = xg q(1) g q(1) g1c . ((1) g ) = (1) g (1) g . (4.6) (4.7) quasi-triangularity quantum double implies existence r-matrix, responsible exchange processes. r-matrix quantum double written (4.8) r(1) = xgh q(1) g (1) g1 . recall full algebra a(1) also r-matrix given (3.29). one ask whether r-matrix (4.8) subalgebra d(1) a(1) compatible (3.29). simple matter show actually identical. may think r-matrix a(1) trivial extension r-matrix d(1). important question whether also possible extend co-product entire algebra a(1). reasons believe cannot extended. one reason co-product related fusion particles quantum level, physically reasonable. however, harder imagine two handles put together could seen single handle. 22 another large distance element a(1) l operator c (1) responsible dehn twist cycle encloses entire geon. words, c (1) 2-rotation geon: c (1) c2.

(5.2) 24 here, qx characteristic function supported x x. let x0 element x. denote kx0 g stability subgroup respect x0, i.e., kx0 = {g g | g(x0) = x0} .

(5.4) let us point c(g) seen vector space carries left representation g, action g left product. irreducible representations g obtained reducing representation. particular, vector space carrying irreducuble representation (irr) kx0 viewed subspace c(g). note f (x) plays dual role: algebra, vector space acted upon group g, according gqx := qg(x). extended action c(g) obvious way. also, acts upon left (pointwise) product. follows shall denote elements qx | xi whenever want view vector belonging representation c(g) f (x) dened. passive role acted upon, instead acting representation algebra functions. state following result. theorem let | ji, j = 1 . . . n basis subspace v c(g) carrying irr kx0. then, (a xed) x0 x, elements g, = 1 . . . n | ji c(g), j = 1 . . . n stated above, vectors form basis irr algebra a, given | x0i | ji :=| i(x0)i | ji , (qx, g) | i(x0)i | ji := x, (x0) | (x0)i ()()kj | ki , uniquely determined equation () matrix representation . gi = , result follows standard construction induced representation theory (cf. discussion poincare group {$9906174$}). quantum double d(h) algebra a(1) particular cases a. quantum double obtained taking x = h, g = h, action g(h) = ghg1. algebra single geon, one takes x = h h 25 group g product h m. actions g h w commute given g(a, b) = (gag1, gbg1), g h w (a, b) = (w(a), w(b)), w m, used notation (3.21). irrs algebra (3.22) constructed given element (a, b) h h. stability subgroup k(a,b) h h dened k(a,b) = n(g, w ) h | gw (a, b) := (gw(a)g1, gw(b)g1) = (a, b)o . (5.5) then, choosing representatives 1, . . . , n cosets, partition h written h = 1k(a,b) 2k(a,b) n k(a,b) . (5.6) let | 1i, . . . , | ni c(h m) basis irr k(a,b). then, according theorem, vectors | i(a, b)i | ji , (5.7) = 1 . . . n, j = 1 . . . n, form basis irr algebra a(1). let us express representations a(1) compact notation. action h x = h h divides x orbits. denote  orbit containing element (a, b) h h. collectivelly call quantum numbers labeling irrs k(a,b). one see (5.7) irr r characterized pair r = (, ). basis irr r a(1) therefore written vectors | i, ji(a,b) ,i = 1, ..., n; j = 1, ..., n dened r | i, ji(a,b) r := | a, bi | ji (5.8) | a, bi state dening representation, (5.6) | ji base elements irreducible representations k(a,b). course, set vectors thus dened depend pair (a, b) choose. x b, henceforth omit superscript. action q(a,b) given q(a,b)|i, j >r= q(a,b) i|a, b > |j >= q(a,b)|ai, bi > |j >= a,aib,bi|i, j >r . (5.9) let gw generic element h m. equation denes uniquely new class i, together element stability group k(a,b). action gw a(1) | i, jir determined (5.10) reads gw = (5.10) gw | i, jir = | a, bi | ji = ()()kj | i, kir = xk 26 (5.11) () matrix representation k(a,b). irr r = (, ) describes distinct quantum geon. corresponding vector spaces hr generated states | i, jir, nite dimensional. therefore easily make hilbert space introducing scalar product hi, j | i, jir = iijj . (5.12) since algebras a(1) dierent choices discrete group h, cannot say general spectrum geon. first, need x group h compute spectrum corresponding a(1). consider two geons described representations r1 r2. associated hilbert space states simply h(12) := hr1 hr2. (5.13) explained section 3, eld algebra consists a(1) a(1) together r s. elements a(1) a(1) act naturally (5.13). remains said action r states hr1 hr2. action r completely determined formula (3.29): r = xa,b q(a,b) 1 aba1b1. words r | i, jir1 | k, lir2 = xa,b 1 aba1b1 | k, lir2 q(a,b) | i, jir1.
