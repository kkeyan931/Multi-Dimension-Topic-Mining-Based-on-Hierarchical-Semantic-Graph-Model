abstract

the renormalization group method is a successive integration over the uc-
tuations which are ordered according to their length scale, a parameter in the
external space. a dierent procedure is described, where the uctuations are
treated in a successive manner, as well, but their order is given by an internal
space parameter, their amplitude. the dierential version of the renormal-
ization group equation is given which is the functional generalization of the
callan-symanzik equation in one special case and resums the loop expansion
in another one.

i. introduction

the renormalization group method is usually applied in two dierent manners. the
original way is to provide an insight into the scale dependence of the coupling constants [1].
another, more recent use is to perform a partial resummation of the perturbation expansion
by making an innitesimal change of the cuto in a time and using the functional formalism
[2]- [7]. both goals are realized by the blocking procedure, the successive elimination of the
degrees of freedom which lie above the running ultraviolet cuto. the resulting evolution
equation yields the dependence of the coupling constants in the cuto which is a scale
parameter introduced in the space-time, the external space. a dicult problem in this
program is the lack of explict gauge invariance. since the separation of the modes according
to their length scales is not gauge invariant, the gauge symmetry is unavoidably lost during
the blocking.

we propose here a dierent slicing procedure of the path integral, the gradual increase of
the amplitude of the uctuations. we introduce a cuto in the internal space1 by constrain-
ing the amplitude of the uctuating eld and obtain the evolution equation by the gradual
release of this constraint. since the eld variable is usually dimensional this procedure can
be interpreted in terms of a scale dependence, as well. more precisely, the mass parameter
of the lagrangian serves as a cuto for both spaces thereby providing a dynamical corre-
spondence between the scales in the internal and the external spaces. an important feature
of this scheme is that the scale parameter, the mass in particular, is introduced by hand
in the internal space. the length scale of the external space is, on the contrary, induced
dynamically. such a dynamically generated length scale in the external space appears more
natural and avoids the problems mentioned above. in fact, having imposed the cuto in
the internal space the gradient expansion, being an approximation procedure in the external
space, goes through without problem. the gauge invariance can be maintained, as well, the
only requirement is that the suppression of the uctuations must be achieved in a gauge
independent fashion, a condition easy to comply with in the internal space. this latter
improvement is somehow reminiscent of the achievement of the higgs mechanism where a
dynamically generated mass is produced without spoiling the gauge symmetry.

there are further advantages in making in the internal space the analogue procedure of
the blocking. one is to get a new insight into the origin of the anomalous dimension. to see
this we recall that the internal space has actually been used for the purpose of establishing
the renormalization group. the renormalization conditions was imposed at a non-vanishing
background eld eld in ref. [8] providing the scale for the internal space. the resulting
renormalization group function was computed in the one-loop level and found to be identical
with the usual functions, resulting from the renormalization conditions introduced in the
external space. this agreement between the scale dependence in the external and internal
space is not generally present and the two-loops results should already yield a dierence.
in fact, the scales inferred from these two spaces are related by the terms of the lagrangian
which mix the internal and the external spaces, the terms with space-time derivatives. the

1the internal and the external spaces stand for the space of the eld amplitude and the space-time
manifold, respectively.

simplest of them is the wave function renormalization constant, b(x) = z 1/2r(x), which
is trivial for a scalar model in the one-loop approximation. the anomalous dimension is
nothing but the demonstration of the dierence between the scale dependence in the internal
and the external spaces.

another bonus of the internal space renormalization group is the generalization of the
callan-symanzik equation for the functional formalism. the callan-symanzik equation de-
scribes the dependence of the green functions on the mass [9]. since the mass parameter
controls the width of the peak in the wave functional around the vacuum conguration the
mass can be thought as the simplest cuto parameter in the internal space. the similarity
of the renormalization group coecient functions obtained by the bona de renormalization
group and the callan-symanzik equation demonstrates that the length scale of the exter-
nal space induced by the mass can be identied by the cuto. the functional evolution
equation resulting from the innitesimal change of the mass is the generalization of the
callan-symanzik equation without relying on the multiplicative renormalization scheme.
such an extension, presented below can be used to study non-renormalizable models or
eects close to the cuto.

when the procedure in the internal space is performed by the help of the bare action
the resulting ow provides a resummation of the loop expansion. this scheme is specially
advantegous for models with inhomogeneous saddle points because the blocking does not
distorts the tree level structure.

the renormalization group step can be expressed by means of the bare action or the
eective action. the two schemes become equivalent in the infrared limit. this can be
seen easily by remarking that the loop contributions are suppressed in the infrared limit,
where the ultraviolet cuto tends to zero with the number of degrees of freedom. since the
dierence between the bare and the eective action comes from the loop contributions the
gradient expansion produces the same bare and eective action in the vicinity of the infrared
xed point.

the dierent standard methods to obtain the renormalization group are briey discussed
in section ii. the internal space evolution equation, our new renormalization group scheme
is introduced in section iii. section iv contains the application of the general strategy of the
internal space renormalization to obtain the generalization of the callan-symanzik equation.
the possibility of resumming the loop expansion by solving the evolution equation is shown
in section v. the section vi is for the summary. the appendices give details about the
legendre transformation and the gradient expansion.

ii. renormalization group schemes

in this section we briey recapitulate some methods the renormalization group equation

can be obtained.

the traditional eld theoretical methods for the renormalization group equation are
based on the simplication oered by placing the ultraviolet cuto far away from the scale
of the observables. such a separation of the scales removes the non-universal pieces of the
renormalized action and the rather complicated blocking step can be simplied by retaining
the renormalizable coupling constants only. the underlying formalism is the renormalized
perturbation expansion, in particular the multiplicative renormalization scheme. the usual

3

perturbative proof of the renormalizability asserts that the renormalized eld and the green
functions can be written in terms of the bare quantities as

gn(p1,   , pn; gr())r = z  n

2  gr, gb,



! gn(p1,   , pn; gb, )b 1 + o  p2

2!! ,

(1)

where  is the cuto and the renormalized coupling constants are dened by some renor-
malization conditions imposed at p2 = 2. the evolution equation for the bare and the
renormalized coupling constants result from the requirements

note that the non-renormalizable operators can not be treated in this fashion because the
o(p/) contributions are neglected in (1). the renormalization of composite operators
and the corresponding operator mixing requires the introduction of additional terms in the
lagrangian. another aspect of this shortcoming is that these methods are useful for the
study of the ultraviolet scaling laws only. the study of the infrared scaling or models where
there are several non-trivial scaling regimes [10] require the more powerful functional form,
introduced below.

the third conventional procedure is the callan-symanzik equation which is based on the

change of the bare mass parameter,

d
dm2 gb =

d
dm2 z

n

2 gr = z

n

2 z2gcomp

r

(4)

where z2 is the renormalization constant for the composite operator 2(x) and gcomp is
the green function with an additional insertion of 2(p = 0). one can convert the mass
dependence inferred from the callan-symanzik equation into the momentum dependence by
means of dimensional analysis and the resulting expression is usually called a renormalization
group equation.

the functional generalizations of the renormalization group method which are based
on the innitesimally small change of the cuto allows up to follow the mixing of non-
renormalizable operators, as well, and to trace the evolution close to the cuto. another
advantage of these methods is that the renormalization group equation is either exact or
holds in every order of the loop expansion.

the traditional blocking [1] in momentum space yields the wegner-houghton equation
[2] which is based on sharp cuto in the momentum space. consider the action with cuto
k in the derivative expansion,

sk =



xn=0z ddxu (n)

k

[(x), ]

(5)

k

where u (n)
[(x), ] is an n-th order homogeneous polynom in the gradient operator  and
a local functional of the eld variable. we separate the quadratic part of the action in the
eld,

(7)

to organize the loop expansion. the blocking step consists of the elimination of the fourier
components of the eld (x) within the shell k  k < p < k. let us write

(x) = (x) + (x)

(8)

where the rst and the second term in non-vanishing in the fourier space for p < k  k
and k  k < p < k, respectively. the blocked action can be written as

eskk[ ] = z d[]esk[ +]

= esk[ +] 1

k [ ]+

(9)

where  is the saddle point, the trace is within the functional space spanned by the plane
waves k  k < p < k, and the dots stand for the higher loop contributions. the density
of the modes to be eliminated, dkkd1, d being the solid angle, is chosen to be small.
this makes the volume of the loop integral appearing in the computation of the trace small,
too. one expects that the n-th loop contributions which contain an n-fold integration in
this small volume will be suppressed as k  0 since the integrand is non-singular in the
integration domain. a more careful argument shows that the small parameter is actually
the ratio of the modes to be eliminated and left in the system [2], [10] assuming that the
amplitude of each fourier mode is of the same order of magnitude2. with this condition
kept in mind the higher loop contributions are dropped yielding the evolution equation

sk[ ]  skk[ ] = 

1
2

trg1[ ] 1 + o  k

k !!

(10)

for vanishing saddle point,  = 0. all we needed in deriving this equation was the availability
of the loop-expansion for the blocking step (9). the simplication, the suppression of the
higher loop contribution, results from the appearance of a new small parameter k/k and
(10) is valid for weakly coupled models only.

we may call this the scheme the functional form of the bare renormalization group,
(2), since the resulting renormalized trajectory is in the space of the cuto theories. the
truncation of the gradient expansion

2it is enough to introduce an infrared cuto and consider the elimination of the modes one-by-
one when this latter condition fails to become convinced that the limit k  0 can not always
suppresses the higher loop contributions to the blocking relation. such a problem shows up when
there is a non-trivial saddle point to the blocking which enhances certain modes [12].

for an n-component eld of modulus .

the inclusion of the o(4) higher order terms in the action is problematic because the

sharp momentum space cuto generates non-local interactions [11].

a similar method was developed for the eective action [3]- [5] where one introduces the

cuto parameter k in the quadratic part of the action g1(p)  g1

k (p), with

g1

k (p) = f (cid:18) p

k(cid:19) g1(p),

(13)

where f () approaches 1 and  for  =  and  = 0, respectively. we have hope to
generate local, gradient expandable interactions only if f () is an analytic function. thus
locality almost excludes the complete suppression of the modes, the choice f () =  for
 > 0 < . the exception to this rule consists of the periodic, analytic functions,

g1

k (p + k) = g1

k (p)

(14)

where the components of the vector k are integer times k. an example is the lattice
regularization where the complete suppression of the modes outside the rst brillouin-zone
can be achieved without generating non-local interactions. when the modes are suppressed
gradually one characterizes the suppression functions by the condition that it changes the
most within the interval 1   <  < 1 + . the limit   0 is called the sharp cuto. the
path integration consists of the elimination of the modes p > k and the evolution equation

kz d[]esk[]+rx

jxx = z d[]ksk[]esk[]+rx

jxx

(15)

is obtained for the generator functional. this relation is nally converted into an equation
for the eective action. since the eective action for the modes p > k is followed in this
manner, these methods appear the analogues of (3), the evolution equation for the running
coupling constants.

the application of (15) is a safe non-perturbative step only for a dierentiable suppression
function f (). when the f () =  for nite values of  or when f () has innite derivative
(say   0) then (15) is invalid. instead one has to consider the nite dierence equation
k  k  k and the corresponding functional taylor expansion brings back the assumption
concerning the applicability of the loop-expansion. thus (15) produces an exact relation for
smoothly suppressed modes only.

the internal space renormalization group method presented in the next section gen-
eralises the third traditional way of introducing the renormalization group, the callan-
symanzyk equation by controlling the amplitude of the uctuations in the internal space
only. the coresponding suppression function can be choose as smooth as possible, f () = ,
in order to suppress the higher order derivative terms generated by the blocking.

iii. evolution equation

our goal is to obtain the eective action [] of the euclidean model dened by the
action sb[], by reducing the renormalization group strategy into an algorithm to solve the
theory. the connection to the external scale dependence will be considered later. the usual
legendre transformation (c.f. appendix a.) yields

and

ew [j] = z d[]esb []+rx

jxx

w [j] + [] = zx

jxx = j  ,

the source j is supposed to be expressed in terms of

x =

w [j]

jx

.

(16)

(17)

(18)

a cuto  is assumed implicitly in the path integral and sb[] stands for the bare, cuto
action.

a sharp cuto could be introduced in the internal space as



z
z = yx

dxes[],

(19)

but it leads to unwanted complications and will be replaced by a smooth cuto as follows.
we modify the bare action

sb[]  s[] = ss[] + sb[]

(20)

in such a manner that the model with    be soluble. this is achieved by requiring
that the minimum  of the local functional ss[]  0, is nondegenerate. in fact, the path
integral for  =  contains no uctuations. the role of the new piece in the action is to
suppress the uctuations around  for large value of  and render the model perturbative.
the control of the amplitude of the uctuations oered by the parameter  is considered
as a smooth cuto in the internal space. the dierence between our strategy and the other
methods is that the internal space cuto appears multiplicatively in the action and inu-
ences all modes simultaneously while the external space cuto is modifying the momentum
dependence. in other words, it is the order the dierent uctuations are treated as the cuto
is decreased what distinguishes the internal and the external space renormalization group
schemes.

we plan to follow the  dependence of the eective action by integrating out the func-

tional dierential equation

from the initial condition

 = f[]

7

(21)

init[] = initss[] + sb[],

(22)

imposed at init   to  = 0. (21) can be interpreted as a generalization of the callan-
symantzik equation becaue both generate a one-parameter family of dierent theories orga-
nized according to the strength of the quantum uctuations 3. so long as the parameter 
introduces a renormalization scale, (), the trajectory ()[] in the eective action space
can be thought as a renormalized trajectory. another way to interpret (21) is to consider
its integration as a method which builds up the uctuations of the model with  = 0 by
summing up the eects of increasing the uctuation strength innitesimally,     .
notice that the gauge invariance of the evolution equation (21) is obvious when ss is gaue
invariant. the gradient expansion is compatible with (21) if the suppression is suciently
smooth in the momentum spcae, i.e. ss is a local functional.

the starting point to nd f[] is the relation

[] = w [j] 

w [j]

j

.j + j. = w [j],

 and  being the independent variables. this relation will be used together with

w [j] = ew [j]z d[]ss[]ess[]sb[] = ew [j]ss" 

j# ew [j].

it is useful to perform the replacement

which results the evolution equation

[]  ss[] + []

[] = ew [j]ss" 

j# ew [j]  ss[].

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

the next question is the choice of ss[]. the simplest is to use a quadratic suppression

term,

ss[] =

1

2 zx,y

xmx,yy =

1
2

  m  .

if a gauge symmetry should be preserved then such an ss[] is not acceptable and

ss[] = sb[]

(27)

(28)

is the most natural choice. the evolution equation (26) then sums up the loop expansion
and produces the dependence in h. we return now to the case of a simple scalar eld without
local symmetry, (27). the corresponding evolution equation can be ontained from (26), and
considering the relation (a4) between the functional derivatives of w [j] and [],

it is illuminating to compare this result with the evolution equations presented in refs.

(32)

the role of ss is played here by the propagator gk(p) which contains the external space
scale parameter k to control the supression of the uctuations. the formal similarity with
(29) reects that the dierent schemes agree in turning on the uctuations in innitesimal
steps. but the internal space scheme operates with a suppression term which is regular in
or even independent of the momentum.

the evolution equation can be converted into a more treatable form by the means of the

gradient expansion,

[] = zx(cid:26)1

zx(x)2 + ux + o(4)(cid:27)

where the notation fx = f (x) was introduced. this ansatz gives

where the f (n)() = n

non-locality of the propagator but might be more successful for the eective action where
the one-particle irreducible structure and the removal of the propagator at the external legs
of the contributing diagrams strongly reduce the non-local eects. the replacement of this
ansatz into (26) gives (c.f. appendix b.)

where rp = r ddp

(2)d and we assumed that m(p) is proportional to p. since the order the
uctuations are treated is dierent for the internal and the external space methods, (35) is
dierent, as well, from the evolution equations of [2]- [7]. the nal solution, correpsonding
to  = 0 in our case and k = 0 in the others, is the eective potential expressed in terms of
the bare and the renormalized coupling constants, respectively.

the simplest choice is  = m2 with

which minimizes strength of the higher order derivative terms generated during the evolution
by being a momentum independent suppression mechanism. the evolution equation is the

(38)

it is important to bear in mind that we are dealing here with a well regulated theory and that
the procedure described here does not aim at removing the external space cuto  which
remains an important external parameter.
in the usual, external space renormalization
schemes the blocking provides the cuto and the regulator for the models. in our case the
cuto in the internal space can not replace the usual external space cuto  and this latter
must properly be implemented from the very beginning, c.f. the remark after (18). in this
case the loop integrals occuring in the evolution equations are nite.

let us now simplify the dierential equation for u() and z() by integrating over p in

the asymptotic scaling formula of the bare renormalization group (12) for d = 4 in the same

butions come from the surface terms of the loop integrals they are suppressed in a renormalizable
theory when  is kept large. thus the gradient expansion anzatz can be justied for the evolution

can be considered as constant, i.e. m2 and k independent. we obtain in this manner the
usual justication of calling the callan-symanzik equation a renormalization group method,
the equivalence of the scales in the internal and the external spaces in the ultraviolet scaling
regime m2  u (2) up to non-universal contributions. the equivalence of the scales and the
elimination of the non-universal contributions requires that the cuto should be far above
the mass, m2  2.
the non-vanishing anomalous dimension sets up the relation between the internal and
in fact, when z 6= 1 the relation (43) becomes eld dependent
external space scaling.

with the prediction of the wegner-houghton equation. a possible attempt to save the
gradient expansion with sharp cuto for the latter is the following: the contributions to
the coecient functions of the gradient, such as zk(), come from taking the derivative of
the loop integral, the trace in the second equation of (9), with respect to the momentum of
the infrared background eld (x). there are two kind of contributions, one which comes
form the derivative of the integrand, another from the external momentum dependence of
the limit of the integration. it is easy to verify that the -dependent non-local contributions
come form the second types only [5]. thus one may consider the approximation where
these contributions are simply neglected, assuming a cancellation mechanism between the
successive blocking steps. the result is, for k2  u (2)

equations produces the solution of the evolution equation (38).

it is instructive to consider the solution in the independent mode approximation where

for d = 4 which reproduces the one-loop solution found in [14]. the agreement between the
independent mode approximation to the internal-space renormalization group equation and
the one-loop solution is expected not only because the right hand side of (29) is o(h) but
because the one-loop contribution to the gamma function is universal, scheme independent.
but this agreement does not hold beyond o(h) as indicated by the imcompatibility of (44)
and (45).

v. h dependence

it may happen that the quadratic suppression is not well suited to a problem. in the
case sb[] possesses local symmetries which should be preserved then the choice (28) is more
appropriate. the application of our procedure for a gauge model can for example be based
on the choice

where sgf contains the gauge xing terms and on the application of a gauge invariant
regularization scheme. as mentioned after eq. (38) we need a regulator to start with in order
to follow the dependence on the amplitude of the uctuations. one may use lattice, analytic
(asymptotically free models) or pauli-villars (qed) regulator to render (26) well dened.
the explicit gauge invariance of ss[a] which was achieved by suppressing the gauge covariant
eld strength instead of the gauge eld itself makes obvious the independence of the resulting
ow for the gauge invariant part of the action from the choice of the gauge, sgf . when a
non-trivial saddle point appears in the blocking step then it may develop a discontinuous
evolution. the choice (28) makes the saddle point approximatively renormalization group
invariant.

since the momentum dependence in the right hand side of (53) is explicit and simple the one,
two and three loop integrals can be carried out easily by means of the standard methods. the
successive derivatives of the resulting expression with respect to  yield the renormalization
group coecient functions.

the use of internal space renormalization discribed in this section shows that this method
can be generalized to any kind of action ss and not only to a quadratic suppression term,
as shown in the previous sections.

vi. summary

the strategy of the renormalization group is developed further in this paper. instead
of following the evolution of the coupling constants corresponding to the same physics our
renormalization group ow sweeps through models with dierent dynamics. the parame-
ter of the ow is the scale of the quantum or thermal uctuations. the result is an exact
functional dierential equation for the eective action. as a special case the functional gen-
eralization of the callan-symanzik equation is recovered. a dierent choice of the blocking
transformation allows us to control h and the resulting ow amounts to the resummation
of the loop expansion.

our scheme can be considered as a renormalization group method in the internal space.
the similarity of the renormalization group ow in the external and the internal space is
shown for the local potential, the zero momentum piece of the eective action. the dierence
between the two schemes is the source of the anomalous dimension and it appears in the
momentum dependent parts of the eective action.

the novel feature of the method is its manifest gauge invariance. this is achieved by the
possibility of characterizing the modes in the internal space while the gauge transformations
are carried out in the external space.

the integration of the internal space evolution equation provides an algorithm to solve
models in a manner similar to the traditional renormalization group method. the only
truncation is done in the gradient expansion of the eective action, in the taylor expansion
of the 1pi functions in the momentum. we believe that this procedure is an interesting
alternative to the stochastic solution method of the lattice regulated models. the drawback
is that it is rather cumbersome, thought possible in principle, to increase the precision in
the momentum and going to higher orders in the gradient expansion. the advantage is that
it can be cast in innite, continuous space-time equipped with minkowski metric.

note added in proof: after this work has been completed we learned that a method
presented for gauge models in ref. [15] is similar to ours in the case of mass dependence
(section iv). [15] gives a loop expanded solution of the exact equation, whereas our solution is
built in the framework of the derivative expansion. finally, our approach can be generalized
to any kind of suppression action ss which is compatible with the symetries as shown in
section v.

appendix b: evolution equation in the internal space

we give here some details on the computation of (35). to get the evolution equation
of the potential part of the gradient expansion (33), one has to take a homogeneous eld
 = 0 in (29). but to distinguish the kinetic contribution from the potential one, a non
homogeneous eld (x) = 0 + (x) is needed, as well. let k be the momentum where the
eld  is non-vanishing. then the eective action can be written as

[] = vdu(0) +

1

2 zq

(q)(q)(cid:16)z(0)q2 + u (2)

 (0)(cid:17) + o(3, k4)

(b1)

where vd is the spatial volume. thus we need the second derivative of the eective action
in (29) up to the second order in  to identify the dierent contributions. the terms
independent of  give the equation for u and the ones proportional to k2 2 the equation
for z. the contributions proportional to 2 but independent of k yield an equation for u (2)

which must be consistent with the equation for u. the result is

 (0)i (p1 + p2)

1 + q2 + qp1) + u (3)

(2)

p1,p2 = hz(0)p2
+ zq
(q)hz (1)

1 + q1q2 + 2q1p1) + u (4)

 (0)(p2

1 + 2q2

(b2)

 (0)i (p1 + p2 + q1 + q2)

finally one computes the inverse of the operator mp1,p2 + (2)
of  and k. the trace over p1 and p2 needs the computations of terms like

p1,p2 and expands it in powers

tr {(p1q1)(p2q2)f (p1, p2)(p1 + p2 + q1 + q2)} =

q2
1
d

(q1 + q2)zp

p2f (p,p)

(b3)

and they lead to (35). the consistency with the equation for u (2)


is satised.

17

appendix c: evolution equation in the external space

the evolution for the blocking in the momentum space is given by the wegner-houghton
equation (10). in order to obtain its simplied version in the gradient expansion one needs
the trace of the logarithm of (2)
p1,p2. this time the trace has to be computed for |p1| and
|p2| in the shell [k  k, k]. this implies that |p1 + q| has to be in the shell, as well, because
p1,p2 contains (p1 + p2 + q). this constrain implies the appearance of q2 in the equation
(2)
for kkzk(). the terms containing q2 are non-local and spoil the the gradient expansion.
kkzk() is proportional to the second derivative of the trace in (10) with respect the
momentum q of the infrared background eld, . the trace can be written as a momentum
internal over the shell [k  k, k]. there are contributions from the dependence on q of the
integrand and the limit of integration. it is worthwhile noting that the later contains all
non-local terms.

there are two ways to rid the non-local contributions when the model is solved by the
loop expansion, i.e. by means of loop integrals for momenta 0  p  . one is to use lattice
regularization where the periodicity in the brillouin zone cancel the q dependence of the
domain of the integration. another way to eliminate the non-local terms is to remove the
cuto. since the non-local contributions represent surface terms they vanish as   .
one may furthermore speculate that some of the non-local terms cancel between the
consecutive steps of the blocking k  k  k for a suitable choice of the cuto function
f () in the propagator g1
k (p) = f (p/k)g1(p). ignoring simply the non-local terms the
identication of the coecients of the dierent powers of the gradient in the two sides of
(10) leads to
