b) = 2 point discontinuity yangmills theories; intriguing feature whose meaning fully understood far. features listed conveniently studied lightcone gauge chosen. gauge faddeevpopov sector decouples 1 2 introduction unphysical degrees freedom content theory minimal. price paid nice features presence called spurious poles vector propagator. handle spurious pole n k = 0 delicate matter; basically diculties encountered past within lightcone gauge quantization related problem. shall see, two possible, inequivalent, ways handling pole: cauchy principal value (cpv) prescription mandelstam-leibbrandt (ml) prescription. result dierent procedures quantization. cpv prescription derived socalled nullframe formalism, well dened strictly two dimension. twodimensional case, cpv prescription, sort happy island: everything works well, connement seems show already perturbative level, boundstates equation large n limit provides discrete spectrum mesons. soon try escape towards higher dimensions, see theory encounters lot inconsistencies. instead, ml prescription derives equaltime quantization, sincere: provide miracle, consistent also higher dimensions, perfect agreement milestone repre- sented feynman gauge 1. nevertheless, also ml prescription, twodimensional case peculiar: fact, approaching = 2, discover surprise discontinuity. coexistence two formulations = 2 motivates pertur- bative enquiries, order understand relationship physical reason p
