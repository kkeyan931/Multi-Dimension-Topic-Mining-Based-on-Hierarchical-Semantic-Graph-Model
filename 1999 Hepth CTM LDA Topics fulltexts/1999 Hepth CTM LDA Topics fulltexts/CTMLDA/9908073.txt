(3.4) since variations elds arbitrary, since (k (k)) = k (k), leads analog euler- lagrange equations k (k) + k (k (k)) k = 0 , (3.5) similarly conjugate. alternatively, second way, treat elds independent variables, however occur k, obtain =z d4k (2)4 "(cid:18) k (k)(cid:19)t (k) +(cid:18) k (k)(cid:19)t (k)# = 0 , subscript denotes total derivative. thus anolog euler-lagrange equations (cid:18) k (k)(cid:19)t = 0 , (3.6) (3.7) similarly conjugate. obviously (3.5). scalar lagrangian (3.3) vary action respect conjugate eld obtain explicitly solution may expressed (cid:18) k (k)(cid:19)t = (h2k2 m2) (k) = 0 , (k) = 2(cid:18)k0 q~k2 + m2/h2(cid:19) +(~k) + 2(cid:18)k0 +q~k2 + m2/h2(cid:19) (~k) , (3.8) (3.9) + arbitrary functions three-vector momentum. corresponds superposition plane wave solutions form (2.3). may consider variational principle wave vector space, terms function k, fundamental basis theory, thereby make explicit reference spacetime. may conceptual philosophical merit experiments particle physics generally scattering experiments directly related momenta particles rather position. may also possible viewpoint might allow easier generalizations theory, discuss next section. 3 iv. generalization theory long supposed fact life dierential equations physics rst second order. well born experience classical mechanics, classical electromagnetism, general relativity, nonrelativitstic quantum mechanics, relativistic quantum mechanics, equations standard model particles second order. may well also developed unjustied bias favor second order equations due mathematical convenience. particularly interesting consider higher order equations inherent dangers diculties boundary conditions. motivated thereby, consider following generalization scalar wave equation , h2( 2 al2 p 4 + . . .)(x) + m2(x) = 0 , 2 2 xx , 4 2 2 , etc. (4.1) lp characteristic distance, presumably order planck distance, dimensionless parameter order 1, either sign. series represents reasonable function power series expansion. equation easily action formalism spacetime since may innite order derivatives. series innite equation is, sense, nonlocal. easily nd plane wave solutions form (2.3). solutions h2k2(1 + al2 pk2 + . . .) + m2 h2k2f 2(k2) + m2 = 0 . note special relativity tells us p2 = m2, h2k2f 2(k2) = p2 .
