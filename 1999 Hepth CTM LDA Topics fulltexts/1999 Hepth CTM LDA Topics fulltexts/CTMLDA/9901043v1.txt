abstract

we review the developments in the past twenty years (which are based on our de-
formation philosophy of physical theories) dealing with elementary particles composed
of singletons in anti de sitter space-time. the study starts with the kinematical as-
pects (especially for massless particles) and extends to the beginning of a eld theory of
composite elementary particles and its relations with conformal eld theory (including
very recent developments).

introduction: deformations and singleton physics

physical theories have their domain of applicability mainly depending on the velocities and
distances concerned. but the passage from one domain (of velocities and distances) to
another one does not appear in an uncontrolled way. rather, a new fundamental constant
enters the modied formalism and the attached structures (symmetries, observables, states,
etc.) deform [fl82, fl98] the initial structure; namely, we have a new structure which in
the limit when the new parameter goes to zero coincides with the old formalism. in other
words, to detect new formalisms we have to study deformations of the algebraic structures
attached to a given formalism.

the only question is in which category we perform this search for deformations. usually
physics is rather conservative and if we start e.g. with the category of associative or lie
algebras, we tend to deform in this category. this is the case of traditional quantization
[bffls, st98] (deforming classical mechanics to quantum mechanics by introducing a new
parameter , keeping the same algebra of observables but deforming their composition law).

this review is dedicated to our friend of 32.5 years, ludwig faddeev, upon the occasion of his 65th
birthday. it was initiated by the rst author; the frame and a rst draft were discussed between all three
authors and the nal formulation was completed by the latter two after the sudden and untimely death of
moshe flato. to be published in a special issue of proceedings of steklov mathematical institute

the same is true of the passage from galilean physics to special relativity (new parameter
c1, where c is the speed of light) and thence to physics in de sitter space-time (the new
parameter being the curvature). it is this last aspect which we shall present here.

in this paper we touch recent developments in eld theories based on supergravity,
conformal eld theories, compactication of higher dimensional eld theories, string theory,
m-theory, p-branes, etc.
for which people rediscovered the eciency and advantages of
anti de sitter theories (which are stable deformations of poincare eld theories in the
category of lie groups; see however [fht] for quantum groups, at roots of unity in that
case). there are many reasons for the advantages of anti de sitter (often abbreviated
as ads) theories among which we can mention that ads eld theory admits an invariant
natural infrared regularization of the theories in question and that the kinematical spectra
(angular momentum and energy) are naturally discrete. but in addition ads theories have
a great bonus: the existence of singleton representations discovered by dirac [di63] for
so(2, 3), corresponding to a square root of ads massless representations. we discovered
that fact around 20 years ago [ff78, ff80] and developed rather extensively its physical
consequences in the following years [af78, affs, bffh, bffs, bfh, faf, ff81, ff84,
ff86, ff86f, ff87, ff88, ff89, ff91, ff98, ffg86, ffs88, fht, fr79, fr82, fr88,
fh87, hff].

singleton theories are topological in the sense that the corresponding singleton eld
theories live naturally on the boundary at innity of the de sitter bulk (boundary which
has one dimension less than the bulk). they are new types of gauge theories which in
addition permit to consider massless particles, e.g. the photon, as dynamically composite
ads particles [ff88, ff98, ffs88]. some of the beautiful properties of singleton theories
can be extended to higher dimensions, and this is the main point of the recent huge interest
in these ads theories, which touched a large variety of aspects of ads physics. more
explicitly, in several of the recent articles among which we can mention [ma97, wi98, fefr,
ffz, fez, fkpz, fmmr, ss98], the new picture permits to study duality between cft
on the boundary at innity and the corresponding ads theory in the bulk. that duality,
which has also interesting dynamical aspects in it, utilizes among other things the great
notational simplications permitted by singleton physics.

2 kinematics: one massless particle = two dirac singletons

in order to give a avor of the basic features of the theory of singletons in the (2+3) anti-
de sitter space-time ads4 and their relation to massless particles, we shall in this section
and in the following indicate some of these features, refering to the quoted literature for
a more detailed presentation. the theory can be extended to other dimensions (higher or
lower). in ads3 one gets essentially the same features [hff]; the main dierence being (as
is well known) that the (2 + 2) de sitter group so(2, 2) is not the full (innite-dimensional)
conformal group of 1 + 1 space-time (one has then to study witt and virasoro algebras; cf.
e.g. [bh86, mi99, it98]). in space-times of dimension  5, some care is needed [al98, la98]
as to the denition of masslessness and of singletons (the very nice properties of dimension 4

are not all preserved, a fact sometimes overlooked in the recent literature); we shall not
enter here into this discussion.

the maximal compact subalgebra of so(2, 3) is so(2)  so(3). we then have minimal
weight (positive energy, which is one of the reasons for choosing ads) unitary irreducible
representations (uirs) of a corresponding lie group. in the following we consider mainly
the twofold covering so(2,3) of the connected component of the identity of so(2, 3), and
denote by d(e0, s) these minimal weight representations. here e0 is the minimal so(2)
eigenvalue and the half-integer s is the spin. these irreducible representations are unitary
(belonging to the discrete series above the limit of unitarity) provided e0  s + 1 for s  1
and e0  s + 1

2 for s = 0 and s = 1
2 .

at the limit of unitarity (i.e. when 2e0, which is an integer for so(2,3) but can take
any value for the universal covering, tends to the limit from above), the harish chandra
module d(e0, s) becomes indecomposable and the physical uir appears as a quotient, a
hall-mark of gauge theories. for instance, for s  1, we get in the limit an indecomposable
representation denoted here by id(s) or more explicitly by d(s + 1, s)  d(s + 2, s  1), a
shorthand notation [ffs88] for what mathematicians would write as a short exact sequence
of modules 0  d(s + 1, s)  id(s)  d(s + 2, s  1)  0.

now in gauge theories one needs extensions involving more than two uirs. a typical
situation is the case of at space electromagnetism where one has the classical gupta-
bleuler triplet which, in our shorthand notations, can be written sc  p h  ga. here
sc (scalar modes) and ga (gauge modes) are massless zero-helicity uirs h(0, 0) of the
poincare (inhomogeneous lorentz) group p1+3 = so(1,3)  r4 while p h is the module of
physical modes, transforming under h(0, 1)h(0, 1), where h(0, s) is the uir of p1+3 with
mass 0 and helicity s  z. the scalar modes can be suppressed by a gauge xing condition
(e.g.
the lorentz condition) but then one is left with a nontrivial extension p h  ga
on the vector space p h +ga which has no invariant nondegenerate metric and cannot be
quantized covariantly. however the above gupta-bleuler triplet, a nontrivial successive
extension sc  (p h  ga), is an indecomposable representation on a space which admits
an invariant nondegenerate (but indenite) hermitian form and it must be used in order to
obtain a covariant quantization of this gauge theory. we shall meet here a similar situation,
which in fact cannot be avoided. indeed a general result [ar85] says in particular that if
an extension u 1  u 2, with u 2 a uir, has a nondegenerate hermitian form, then u 1 is
equivalent to an extension u 3  u 2 for some representation u 3 and the original extension
is in fact a triplet u 2  u 3  u 2.

the massless representations of so(2, 3) are dened (for s  1

2 ) as d(s + 1, s) and (for
helicity zero) d(1, 0)  d(2, 0). there are many justications to this denition, among
which we can mention [affs]:

a) the representations d(s + 1, s) contract smoothly, in a precise mathematical sense,
to either one of the two massless representations h(0, s) of p1+3. each of the latter
has an operationally unique extension to a uir of so(2,4) (a 4-fold covering of the
conformal group), the restriction of which to the so(2,3) subgroup is exactly the
representation we started with. moreover each d(s + 1, s) can be extended (also

4

moshe flato, christian frnsdal and daniel sternheimer

uniquely once the sign is xed) to either of the two uirs of the conformal group
which have h(0, s) for restriction to the poincare group p1+3. the same properties
are true (for helicity zero) of d(1, 0)  d(2, 0).

b) the representations d(e0, s) can be realized as eld theories on ads4 but, at the
limit of unitarity d(s + 1, s) with s  1, they are accompanied by extensions. as a
consequence we get a gauge theory, quantizable only by use of an indenite metric
and a gupta-bleuler triplet. for d(s+1, s) with s  0, the physical signals propagate
on the ads4 light cone [ffg86].

for s = 0 and s = 1
2 , the above mentioned gauge theory appears not at the level of the
massless representations d(1, 0)  d(2, 0) and d( 3
2 ) but at the limit of unitarity, the
singletons rac= d( 1
2 ). these uirs remain irreducible on the lorentz
subgroup so(1, 3) and on the (1+2) dimensional poincare group p1+2, of which so(2,3)
is the conformal group. on p1+2 they give [bi82] the only massless (discrete helicity)
representations. the singleton representations have a fundamental property:

note that all the representations that appear in the decomposition are massless representa-
tions. thus, in contradistinction with at space, in ads4, massless states are composed
of two singletons. the at space limit of a singleton is a vacuum (a representation of p1+3
which is trivial on the translations) and, even in ads4, the singletons are very poor in
states: their (e, j) diagram has only a single trajectory (hence their name). the (e, j)
spectra of the massless and singleton representations is:

d(s + 1, s), s > 0: e  j = 1, 2, . . .; j  s = 0, 1, . . . .
d(1, 0): e  j = 1, 3, . . .; j = 0, 1, . . . ; d(2, 0): e  j = 2, 4, . . .; j = 0, 1, . . . .

2 ): e  j = 1

2 ; j = 1

[in ads3, where so(2, 3) is the conformal lie algebra and the anti-de sitter lie algebra is
so(2, 2)  so(1, 2)  so(1, 2), the physical massless representations are di and rac and
the analogue of singletons are the metaplectic representations d( 1
4 ) of so(1, 2).
the sum of the two latter is the harmonic oscillator representation and its tensor square
is dirac, so we have an exact analogue of (1) [ff80]. there is however a potentially
important dierence [hff]: the ads3 algebra so(2, 2) is no more the whole conformal
algebra of the 1 + 1 space time, since that algebra is well-known to be innite dimensional.
we shall not elaborate on this point here.]

4 ) and d( 3

in normal units a singleton with angular momentum j has energy e = (j + 1

2 ), where
 is the curvature of the ads4 universe. this means that only a laboratory of cosmic
dimensions can detect a j large enough for e to be measurable since the cosmological
constant (of the order of ) is very small. at the at space limit, the singletons become
vacua (representations of p1+3 with vanishing energy and momentum) so that they carry
no energy at all. furthermore local observation of a free singleton eld is prevented by

gauge invariance (we shall come back briey to this point below). we thus have what can
be called kinematical connement of singletons [ff80], which suggests that they can be
a viable alternative for quarks as fundamental constituents of matter. elementary particles
would then be composed of two, three or more singletons and/or anti singletons (the latter
being associated with the contragredient representations). as with quarks, several (three
so far) avors of singletons (and anti singletons) should eventually be introduced to account
for all elementary particles. in order to pursue this point further we need to develop a eld
theory of singletons and of particles composed of singletons.

in this section we shall give a very short overview of the many developments already achieved
with singleton eld theory and interactions of singletons. a rst attempt to quantize the
singleton eld was based on the de sitter covariant klein-gordon equation ((cid:3)  5
4 ) = 0
where  = 3,  the cosmological constant. an appropriate choice of boundary conditions,
2  <  as r  , leads to a space of solutions that carries the singleton represen-

tation d( 1
2 , 0) is induced on a quotient
space of solutions, where the ignorable invariant subspace consists of the solutions that
2   0 as r  . this is a diculty even in the context of classical eld
satisfy lim r
theory, for it means that there is no invariant propagator that includes the contributions
from the singleton modes. an invariant propagator does exist, but an examination of its
2 at innity; these
asymptotic properties reveals that all its fourier modes fall o as 1/r
modes constitute an invariant subspace on which the space time symmetry group acts by
d( 5

2 , 0).
it is very signicant that this representation on the ignorable gauge modes is of the
ordinary massive type, while the singleton representation is highly degenerate. the energy
levels of the former are degenerate and the spectrum of angular momentum is limited from
above by the energy (in units of ). the energy levels of d( 1
2 , 0) are much more degenerate:
l = e  1
2 . this suggests that the physical, singleton modes are swamped by the gauge
modes and that any interaction designed to detect singletons will fail to be gauge invariant
and hence non-unitary.

in the idiom of representation theory, the space of solutions of the equation ((cid:3) 5

4 ) =
2  <  as r  , carries the non-decomposable
0 satisfying the boundary condition r
representation d( 1
2 , 0). quantization needs a non-degenerate, invariant sym-
plectic structure. this requires the introduction of additional modes, canonically conjugate
to the gauge modes (compare the situation in electrodynamics where maxwell theory has
no momentum conjugate to gauge modes), to give to the total space the symmetric form

it is remarkable that this particular instance of the dipole equation, in marked contrast
with what is the case in at space, and also in anti de sitter space with any other value of
the mass parameter, actually contains physical propagating modes. (in all the other cases
the representation takes the form scalargauge, with no physical section in between.)
what is even more remarkable is that this theory is a topological eld theory; that is, the

physical solutions manifest themselves only by their boundary values at r  : lim r
denes a eld on the 3-dimensional boundary at innity. there, on the boundary, gauge
invariant interactions are possible and make a 3-dimensional conformal eld theory. this is
a 4-dimensional analogue of the 5-dimensional anti desitter/4-dimensional conformal eld
theory duality discovered recently by maldacena [ma97].

however, if massless elds (in 4 dimensions) are singleton composites, then singleton
must come to life as four dimensional objects, and this requires the introduction of un-
conventional statistics. the requirement that the bilinears have the properties of ordinary
(massless) bosons also tells us that the statistics of singletons must be of another sort.

the basic idea is [ff88, ffs88] that we can decompose the singleton eld operator
 j(x)aj in terms of positive energy creation operators aj = aj and an-
as (x) = p
nihilation operators aj (with j > 0) without so far making any assumptions about their
commutation relations. the choice of commutation relations comes later, when requir-
ing that photons, considered as two-rac elds (using the full tensor product of the two
singleton triplets) be bose-einstein quanta. the singletons are then subject to unconven-
tional statistics [ff89] (which is perfectly admissible since they are naturally conned)
and an appropriate fock space can be constructed. based on these principles, a (confor-
mally covariant) composite qed theory was constructed [ff88], with all the good fea-
tures of the usual theory.
in addition one can show [ff87] that the brst structure
of singleton gauge theory induces the brst structure of the electromagnetic potential.
conformal covariance is based [bfh] on the indecomposable so(2, 4) gupta-bleuler triplet
d(1, 1
2 ) which gives by restriction two inequiv-
alent de sitter triplets d(3, 0)  d(2, 1)  d(3, 0) and d(1, 1)  [d(2, 1)id]  d(1, 1),
both of which appear in the direct product of d( 5

2 )  [d(2, 1, 0)d(2, 0, 1)id]  d(1, 1

2 , 1

2 , 1

2 , 0)  d( 1

2 , 0)  d( 5

2 , 0) by itself.

this procedure can be (and has in great part been) extended to the spinor singleton
(the di) and both di and rac can be combined to give a supereld formulation covariant
under the superalgebra osp(4|1) [fr88, ff98]. this will permit to include yang-mills elds,
quantum gravity, supergravity and models of qcd, all based on singletons as fundamental
constituents.

the latest contribution [ff98] to this interpretation of massless elds as singleton com-
posites deals with gravitons, giving an explicit expression for the weak gravitational poten-
tial in terms of singleton bilinears. if this idea is introduced in the context of bulk/boundary
duality, then it is natural to relate massless elds on the bulk to conserved currents on the
boundary. but we are interested in the composite nature of massless elds on space time
(the bulk), and a direct current-eld identity is then inappropriate, since currents are con-

now remember that the massless de sitter representation d( 3

served by virtue of the eld equations while massless elds are divergenceless only on the
physical subspace dened by gauge xing. in the paper [ff98] it was shown that the dipole
formulation provides a natural construction of all massless elds in terms of bilinears that
are conserved only by virtue of the gauge xing condition on constituent singleton elds.
2 ) (in contrast with
other d(s + 1, s) representations), has spin above the limit of unitarity, a fact that singles
it out among massless ads4 particles. it can be obtained as one of the two, 5-related,
irreducible representations that constitute the space of solutions of the corresponding dirac
equation. by developing a eld theory of composite neutrinos along the lines explained
above (neutrinos composed of singleton pairs, with three avors of singletons) it might
be possible to correlate the recently observed oscillations between the two or three kinds
of neutrinos (that suggests they should have a mass and gives some estimates of it) with
the ads4 description of these massless particles. to avoid misunderstandings we want
to stress that we are fully aware of the fact that any reasonable estimate of the value
of the cosmological constant rules out a direct connection to the value of experimental
parameters like pc violation coupling constants or neutrino masses. (pc violation is a
feature of composite qed, though no estimate of its strength has been made.) what we
are saying is that the structure of anti de sitter eld theory, and more especially the
structure of singleton eld theory, may provide a natural framework for a description of
neutrino oscillations.
