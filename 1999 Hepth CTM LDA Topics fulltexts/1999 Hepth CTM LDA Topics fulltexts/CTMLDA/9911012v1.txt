abstract

the cubic scalar eld theory admits the bell-shaped solitary wave solutions which can be interpreted as
massive bose particles. we rule out the nonminimal p-brane action for such a solution as the point particle
with curvature. when quantizing it as the theory with higher derivatives, it is shown that the corresponding
quantum equation has su(2) dynamical symmetry group realizing the exact spin-coordinate correspondence.
finally, we calculate the quantum corrections to the mass of the bell boson which can not be obtained by
means of the perturbation theory starting from the vacuum sector.

1 introduction

the kink solutions are known to be the solitary wave solutions appearing in the
relativistic 4 or sine-gordon models and admitting the interpretation in terms of
a particle. their classical and quantum properties are already studied in a lot of
works [1, 2, 3]. the aim of this paper is to study another, bell-shaped, solitary wave
solution which has to be the only particle-like solution in the 3 theory. the ap-
proach developed in [2] consists in the constructing of the p-brane action where the
nonminimal terms depending on the world-volume curvature are induced by the eld
uctuations in the neighborhood of the static solution. when requiring these uctu-
ations to be damping at innity, the eective action evidently arises after nonlinear
reparametrization of the initial theory and excluding of zero eld oscillations.

the paper is arranged as follows. in sec. 2 we obtain 3-bell solution and study its
properties on the classical level. in sec. 3 we perform the nonlinear parametrization
of the 3 action by means of the bogolyubov transition to the collective degrees

1

of freedom. after this, minimizing the action with respect to eld uctuations, we
remove zero modes and obtain the eective action containing the curvature terms.
sec. 4 is devoted to quantization of this action as the constrained theory with higher
derivatives.
in result we obtain the schroedinger wave equation describing wave
functions and mass spectrum of the quantum bell boson. then we calculate the zeroth
and rst excited levels to rule out the bell particle mass with quantum corrections.
conclusions are made in sec. 5.

hence

  (  m2/)(3  m2/) = 0.

one should done the following remarks upon the features of the solution (11).
at rst, it is topologically trivial unlike, e.g., the kink solutions in the 4 or sin-
gordon theories. it could give rise to certain problems with the stability against small
perturbations but following the theorem proven below the corresponding eective p-
brane action for the bell boson appears to be stable. second, unlike the 4 or sin-
gordon cases the function b has not to be the solution of (7). it means that the
particle-antiparticle interpretation in the 3 theory diers from that in the 4 one
and should be modied. one can show that the model (2) at m2 < 0 also admits the
single particle-like solution

b() =

(15)

having the same energy (12) - (14). from the gure 1 one can see that the bell and
anti-bell solitons occupy the dierent level lines shifted with respect to each other. it
evidently has to be the consequence of the fact that the symmetry    in the
cubic sft is broken initially.

3 eective action

in this section we will construct the nonlinear eective action of the 3 theory (1),
(4) about the static bell solution (11). let us introduce the set of the collective
coordinates {0 = s, 1 = } such that
xm = xm(s) + em

(16)

where xm(s) turn to be the coordinates of a (1+1)-dimensional point particle, em
(1)(s)
is the unit spacelike vector orthogonal to the world line, hence the components of the
frenet basis are

(1)(s), (x, t) = e(),

em
(0) =

xm
 x2

, em

(1) =

where the dot means the derivative with respect to s. then the action (1) can be
rewritten in the new coordinates as

s[e] =z l(e)  d2,
k(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

and k is the curvature of a particle world line

where mn is the unit antisymmetric tensor. this new action contains the redundant
degree of freedom which eventually leads to appearance of the so-called zero modes
[4]. to eliminate this nonphysical degree of freedom we must constrain the model
by means of the conditions of both the vanishing of the functional derivative with
respect to eld uctuations about some chosen static solutions and damping of the
uctuations at innity, and in result we will obtain the required eective action.

so, the uctuations of the eld e() in the neighborhood of some static solution

st() are given by the expression

substituting it into the action (17) and considering the static equation of motion (4)
for st we have

first of all, we are needed to nd the solution of the last equation such that eld
uctuations vanish at both innities, i.e., we suppose the next boundary conditions:

f (+) = f () = 0,

(25)

evidently corresponding to the singular stourm-liouville problem which can be com-
pletely resolved in our case.

theorem. the dierential equation (24) has the two eigenfunctions and eigenvalues

satisfying with the boundary conditions (25):

f+ =

f =

c+(cosh2u  5/4) + 2 sinh u
c  2 sinh u

3cosh3u

, c = 5,

5cosh3u

, c+ = 3,

where b are arbitrary integration constants.

proof. firstly we consider the case c = 0. then the general integral of eq. (24) is

fc=0 =

c1

cosh2u(cid:21) + c2cosh4u f(cid:18)1, 3,

(26)

where f (a, b, c; z) is the hypergeometric function, ci are integration constants. as
one can see this solution does not satisfy with (25). therefore, below we will assume
c 6= 0.

performing the variable change z = cosh2u, we can rewrite (24) in the form

then the bound state condition (25) should be rewritten as

the general integral of eq. (28) can be expressed in the form:

; z(cid:19) + c2z2 f(cid:18)2 ec, 2 +ec,

expanding the hypergeometric functions in series in the neighborhood of z = 1, it is
straightforward to check that the rst from the conditions (30) will be satised if we
suppose

c2 =

(ec2  1)(4ec2  1)(4ec2  9) tan (ec)c1  c (reg)c1,

therefore, the solution of eq. (29) vanishing at z = 1 is the function

2 ec, 

; z(cid:19)  c (reg)z2 f(cid:18)2 ec, 2 +ec,

(31)
to specify the parameters at which f (reg) would satisfy with the second condition

c1 ef (reg) = z3/2 f(cid:18)
(30) we should consider the asymptotical behavior of ef (reg) at large z. we have

+ec,

c (reg)(a  3/2)(a  1)(cid:21)(x)a (1 + o(1/x)) .

from this expression and eqs. (29) and (31) it can easily be seen that ef (reg) does not

satisfy with the stourm-liouville conditions everywhere except the points:

or, following (29),

|ec| = 1/2, 3/2,
c = 3,5,

respectively. the corresponding eigenfunctions can be obtained directly from (31),
q.e.d.

by virtue of this theorem we have recently obtained all the necessary functions to
construct the eective action for the 3 theory about the static bell solution. taking
into account eqs. (21) and (22) and the theorem, the action (20) can be rewritten in
the explicit p-brane form

thus, one can see that the uctuational corrections lead to appearance of two dierent
 (unlike the single  in [2]), therefore, we have the bifurcation of the bell solution
(11) as the particle with curvature. however, in the following section it will be shown
that on the quantum level nonminimal term, leading to the quantum mass corrections,
is required to be such that c > 0.

considering the proven theorem, one can see that eq. (23) was just the linearized
version of this expression.

4 quantization

in the previous section we obtained classical eective actions for the model in question.
thus, to quantize them we must consecutively construct the hamiltonian structure of
the point particle with curvature. from eqs. (18) and (33) one can see that we have
the theory with higher derivatives [5]. hence, below we will treat the coordinates
and momenta as the canonically independent coordinates of phase space. the phase
space consists of the two pairs of canonical variables:

xm, pm =

qm = xm, m =

le
qm  m,
le
 qm ,

hence we have

pn = en

besides, the hessian matrix constructed from the derivatives with respect to acceler-
ations appears to be singular that points out the presence of the constraints on the
phase variables of the theory. there exist the two primary constraints of rst kind

(36)

(37)

(38)

(39)

(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)

(44)

besides we should add the proper time gauge condition,

cm2
4

q22#  0,

1 = mqm  0,
2 = pmqm +qq2" +
g =qq2  1  0,

to remove the non-physical gauge degree of freedom. then, when introducing the
new variables,

the constraints can be rewritten in the form

 =qq2, v = arctanh(cid:16)p(1)/p(0)(cid:17) ,

1 = ,

2 = "qp2 cosh v +

g =   1,

hence nally we obtain the constraint

cm2
4
which in the quantum theory (v = i/v) yields

2 = qp2 cosh v +  

2
v  0,

(45)

as was shown by kapustnikov et al, the constraint 2 on the quantum level admits
several coordinate representations that, generally speaking, lead to dierent nonequiv-

b2|i = 0.

alent theories, therefore, the choice between the dierent forms of b2 should be based

on the physical relevance. then the physically admissible equation determining quan-
tum dynamics of the quantum bell particle has the form:

where s = 0 in our case, and

(46)

(47)

(48)

it can readily be seen that for the case c the ratio m/ should be negative that seems
to be unphysical because we expect that in ground state m = . in this connection
even the interpretation in terms of antiparticles does not save a situation because, as
was mentioned above, the solution which could be interpreted as the anti-bell boson
state lies in the rather dierent parameter space (unlike the 4 theory where the
p-branes with negative  admit physical interpretation). therefore, below we will
consider the case c+.

as was established in the works [6, 7], su(2) has to be the dynamical symmetry
group for this hamiltonian which can be rewritten in the form of the spin hamiltonian

where the spin operators,

satisfy with the commutation relations

besides

z  s(s + 1).

at s  0 there exists an irreducible (2s + 1)-dimensional subspace of the representa-
tion space of the su(2) lie algebra, which is invariant with respect to these operators.
determining eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the spin hamiltonian in the matrix rep-
resentation which is realized in this subspace, one can prove that the solution of (46)
is the function

() = exp(cid:18)

cs+1 = cs1 = 0,  = s,  s + 1, ..., s.

regrettably, these expressions give only the nite number of exact solutions which is
equal to the dimensionality of the invariant subspace. therefore, for the spin s = 0
we can nd only the ground state wave function and eigenvalue:

0() = c1 exp(cid:18)

b
2

cosh (cid:19), 0 = 0,

(52)

i.e., we have obtained the expected result that the mass of the quantum bell c+-boson
in the ground state coincide with the classical one,

m0 = .

(53)

in absence of exact wave functions for more excited levels let us nd the rst quantum
correction to mass of the bell particle in the approximation of the quantum harmonic
oscillator. it is easy to see that at b  1 the (eective) potential

v () =(cid:18)b
2(cid:19)2

sinh2 

b

(54)

has the single minimum

vmin = b/2 at min = 0.

then following to the h-expansion technique we shift the origin of coordinates (to
satisfy  = 0 = 0 in absence of quantum oscillations) in the point of minimum, and
expand v in the taylor series to second order near the origin thus reducing the model
to the oscillator of the unit mass, energy /2 and oscillation frequency

 =

2qb(b  1).

therefore, the quantization rules yield the discrete spectrum

 =qb(b  1)(n + 1/2) + o(h2), n = 0, 1, 2, ...,

(55)

10

and the rst quantum correction to particle mass will be determined by the lower
energy of oscillations:

that gives the algebraic equation for m as a function of m and .

we can easily resolve it in the approximation of weak coupling. assuming   0

(or, equivalently, b  1) we nd eq. (56) in the form

 =

2qb(b  1) + o(h2),

 =

(57)

(58)

(59)

which after considering of eqs. (48) and (53) yields

(m  )2 =

hence we obtain

m =  

m + o(h2).

thus, the mass of the bell boson with quantum corrections at rst order of h is

the quantum term in this expression has to be in good agreement with that obtained
in [1] and numerically justied in [2] for the kink solution. we just point out that the
main (classical) term turns to be singular at   0, therefore, the obtained results are
nonperturbative and can not be ruled out from the vacuum sector of the 3 theory
through the series of the perturbation theory.

5 conclusion

it was shown that the cubic scalar eld theory admits the localized bell-shaped soli-
tary wave interpreted as a massive quantum mechanical particle. this solution has
the counterpart of the same mass which can be imagined as the antiparticle. the
dierences in the particle-antiparticle interpretation from that for the models con-
serving the parity symmetry were studied in this connection. further, considering
eld uctuations in the neighborhood of the static solution, we ruled out the p-brane
action for the 3-bell solutions as the nonminimal point particle with curvature.

when quantizing this action as the constrained theory with higher derivatives, it
was shown that the resulting schroedinger equation has the potential from the razavi
class. this equation has su(2) dynamical symmetry group in the ground state and
can be written by virtue of spin operators. note, that though the reformulation
of some interaction concerning the coordinate degrees of freedom in terms of spin
variables is widely used (e.g., in the theories described by the heisenberg hamiltonian,
see [8]), it has to be merely the physical approximation as a rule, whereas in our
case the spin-coordinate correspondence is exact. finally, we found the quantum
corrections to the mass of the bell bosons which could not be obtained by means of
the perturbation theory starting from the vacuum sector.
