1. introduction

d-branes are destined to play a fundamental role in the formulation of nonperturbative

string theory. nevertheless, despite much work, and a good understanding of examples

such as toroidal compactication, there is as yet no general formulation of the d-brane

spectrum applicable to an arbitrary closed string background. in this note we point out

one simple aspect of d-branes which, we conjecture, is quite general. namely, the square

of the tension of a d-brane is proportional to the regularized dimension of some innite

dimensional algebra. we show that this is indeed true for the wide class of d-branes

associated to rational and quasi-rational conformal eld theories.

while the general construction of the d-brane spectrum has yet to be carried out,

much is indeed known thanks to recent vigorous development of boundary conformal

eld theory, and the boundary state formalism. a partial list of references includes

[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14]. one point which is well-established is that boundary
states |bii are linear functionals on the closed string statespace hclosed preserving confor-
mal invariance

(ln  ln)|bii = 0
where ln, ln are the left and right virasoro generators.

(1.1)

one might think that (1.1), which imposes conformal invariance on the string world-

sheet, is the only condition one needs to impose to nd physically acceptable boundary

states in string theory. taking this point of view immediately leads to problems: there

are far too many solutions to (1.1) for an acceptable d-brane spectrum. indeed, (1.1) is

a linear equation and solutions are in one to one correspondence with spinless virasoro
in the closed string spectrum [15](here h = h and  is a degeneracy index.)
primaries 
this result is most naturally understood as follows [5,14]. we can decompose hclosed

h,h

in terms of virasoro irreps vh as

hclosed = (h,h)specvh  vh

(1.2)

where the spectrum of the closed string theory is determined by the set spec of pairs of
conformal dimensions. we can then solve (1.1) in each component of hclosed as

|biih,h = xm, m

am, m|h, mi  |h, mi  vh  vh.

(1.3)

1

using the inner product on vh under which ln = ln, |biih,h is equivalent to a homo-
morphism bh,h : vh  vh given by

bh,h = xm, m

am, m|h, mi  hh, m|

(1.4)

ln. that is, bh,h is an intertwiner between vh and vh. since these
obeying lnbh,h = bh,h
are irreps it follows from schurs lemma that that |biih,h vanishes if h 6= h and that bh,h
is proportional to the identity when h = h (the fact that we need h = h is already clear
from the n = 0 component of (1.1)). choosing the proportionality constant to be one, we
can take b acting on hclosed to be the projection operator onto vh  vh=h. we denote the
corresponding states in hclosed by |h, h = hii. there is a natural generalization of this
construction to arbitrary chiral algebras [16,12,14] and in this context the states are often

referred to as ishibashi states. we will refer to them as character states.

one problem with these virasoro character states is that most of them do not couple

to the graviton at leading order in string perturbation theory. this follows because the

overlap with the graviton state of a primary or descendent in another irrep (not containing

the graviton state as primary) is zero. therefore, if one wrapped these branes on cycles
the resulting particles would have string scale o(g0
s ) masses and one would expect severe
problems with unitarity.

on the other hand, it has been well appreciated for some time that in addition to

(1.1) various sewing and locality conditions should be imposed [4,6], at least if one desires

a description in terms of local boundary conformal eld theory on the string worldsheet.

an especially important role is played by the cardy condition [3]. to state this condition
consider possible boundary states |ii, |ii, and compute the partition function (cylinder
amplitude)

z = hh|q

1

2 (lc
c

0+ lc

0 c
12 )

|ii

(1.5)

0, lc

where lc

0 are the left and right-moving closed string hamiltonians and qc = e2tc.
this can be given a hamiltonian interpretation in the open string channel by viewing the

cylinder as an annulus with euclidean time running around the annulus. after a conformal

rescaling of coordinates we should thus be able to write (1.5) as

lopen
0 c/24
trh q
o

(1.6)

where h is the hilbert space of open strings with boundary conditions dened by , 
and qo = e2to = e2/tc. cardys condition follows from the equality of (1.5) and (1.6).

2

in other words, the modular transform of (1.5) to the variable qo should have a qo expansion
with non-negative integer coecients for all possible pairs of boundary states |ii, |ii.
we will call such a set of boundary states a cardy set.

in the following we demonstrate that imposing the cardy condition reduces the solu-

tions to (1.1) down to an acceptable few: boundary states satisfying the cardy condition

must couple to the graviton at leading order in string perturbation theory, and therefore
have tensions of order o(g1
s ).

moreover, we nd that the tensions are given by the (suitably regularized) dimension

of an associated open string statespace as in equations (2.3) and (3.13) below. we believe

that the generality of this result has not been appreciated previously, although many of

the elements of our argument are not new. in particular, the regularized dimension has

appeared previously in the literature on boundary cft as the boundary entropy of aeck

and ludwig [17]. the connection between d-brane energy and boundary entropy was made

in [18] for d-branes moving in at space. furthermore, we discovered after completing this

work that our computation of the boundary entropy for torus compactications in sec 2.2

below appeared earlier in [19].

2. the general argument: bosonic string

we consider a spacetime dened by a closed conformal eld theory of the type
c(ir1,25d)  c2. the rst factor is the usual conformal eld theory of 26  d free un-
compactied bosons and ghosts. for our purposes it suces to work in light-cone gauge
in which case we can drop the ghost elds and view the rst factor as the cft of 24  d
free bosons. the second factor is an arbitrary unitary cft of c = c = d. we will choose

d suciently large so that we can view the dp-brane we are interested in as a d-particle
in 26  d spacetime dimensions.

2.1. d-brane tension

we consider d-brane boundary states of the form:

|xii  |ii

(2.1)

here |ii is a boundary state for c2 which is assumed to be part of a cardy set.
it
corresponds to an open string channel statespace h as in (1.6). the rst factor |xii is

3

a standard position eigenstate d-brane state constructed from coherent states of lightcone

gauge oscillators.

|xii := ns.t.z d24dkeikxep 1

n n n|ki

(2.2)

here |ki denotes a momentum eigenstate in the closed string hilbert space; the normal-
ization ns.t. can be gleaned from [8] and involves powers of 2, , s.

the d-brane state (2.1) describes a particle in the (26  d)-dimensional spacetime

theory. the formula for the mass of this particle in terms of h is:

(sm )2 =

1

(2s)24d

(64)2

g26d

dimh

(2.3)

where g26d is the newton constant in 26-d dimensions, s is the string length ( = 2
s)
and dimh is the regularized dimension, dened by

dimh = lim
0

e2ic/24(1/ )trh ql0c/24

(2.4)

where q = e2i .

in order to prove (2.3) we will assume that c2 is described by rational conformal eld
theory (rcft). we believe that this is only a technical assumption and that (2.3) holds

more generally. some evidence for this will be given later where (2.3) will be seen to hold

in quasirational theories.

in rcft we have isomorphic left and right-moving chiral algebras al = ar = a
which contain the virasoro algebra and which may in general be subalgebras of a larger
chiral algebra. we denote the moments of the chiral elds generating a by wn. by
denition, the hilbert space can be decomposed into a nite set of irreps vj of a

hclosed = (j,j)specvj  vj

(2.5)

with spec labelling the irreps in the spectrum, possibly with multiplicities nj,j. the
characters

i( ) = trviql0c/24

transform under modular transformations   1/ according to

i(1/ ) =xj

s j
i j( )

4

(2.6)

(2.7)

for each irrep vi there is a primary eld i obeying the fusion algebra

with structure constants related to the s matrix by the verlinde formula

demanding that a act in the rcft with boundary requires that

(wn  (1)hw ( wn))|ii = 0

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

where hw is the conformal dimension (spin) of w and  is an automorphism of a. char-
acter states |jii solving (2.10) can be constructed by a slight variant of the argument given
earlier [16,14]. the character states |jii of a do not in general form a cardy set. since
character states form a basis, we can write possible elements of a cardy set as

|jii

(2.11)

|ii =xj

(2.15)

the solution originally given by cardy has  running over the irreps of a and (ni) =

will exist [6,11,14] (this happens for as simple a system as the rational circle) and we will

n i

only assume (2.15) in what follows.

we are now ready to prove (2.3). the key observation is that the mass is measured by
the one-point function with the graviton. the graviton vertex operator  x  x eikx
1 is the unit operator in the internal theory c2. thus we need only know the coupling of
|ii to the character of the representation with the unit operator in order to compute the
mass of the d-brane.

the unit operator is in a unique character state |1ii and uniqueness of the vacuum
implies h0|1ii = 1. therefore, the dependence of the tension on the internal conformal
/s11. on the other hand, the regularized dimension of h is
eld theory is exactly 1

where we have used (2.14),(2.15), and the fact that k(qc) goes like qhkc/24
as qc  0 so
that the dominant contribution comes from the identity representation with h1 = 0 in the
limit. this then proves (2.3) up to overall factors which can be determined by working on

c

the torus (see below) and comparing to [20].

it is easy to show that the dimension (and hence the tension) is nonzero, at least in
rcfts. in the cardy condition we impose positivity (nj)  0 and the vacuum must
appear in (n0)  1. moreover, the matrix element sj1  0. this latter fact is easily
proved since the regularized dimension of the representation j of the chiral algebra is given

by the modular matrix [21]:

dimhj = lim
t0

trhj e2th
trh1 e2th =

sj1
s11

(2.17)

this is a limit of positive quantities and hence nonnegative.2 in fact, in rcft the sj1
cannot vanish because that leads to inconsistencies in the modular representation. indeed

2 we are assuming unitarity of the internal cft c2 here, which is reasonable for string theory

applications.

6

the interpretation of this quantity as a positive dimension is crucial to the general picture

of rcft as a generalization of group theory [22,23].

remarks:

1. from the closed string point of view, the limit used to dene the regularized dimension

is of course the same as the limit originally used by polchinski to compute the tension

for d-branes in at space [24].

2. the derivation is valid to leading order in string perturbation theory, which makes it

an exact statement for bps branes. it would be interesting to see if there is a sense

in which it is true beyond leading order. because the result seems very natural to us,

we conjecture that it will continue to hold even for nonrational backgrounds.

3. note that (2.3) behaves nicely upon inclusion of chan-paton spaces

qdim(cid:0)h  m atn (ir)(cid:1) = npdim(h)

(2.18)

actually, in string theory we impose a reality condition on chan-paton factors in

m atn (c) so that chan-paton factors take values in the hermitian matrices, hn , but
the real dimension is again dim hn = n 2.

4. as mentioned earlier, the quantity  1
s11

is what aeck and ludwig call the nonin-

tegral groundstate degeneracy in boundary cft. it has been conjectured, and es-

tablished in conformal perturbation theory, that this quantity descreases along renor-

malization group ows. see [17,25,14] for further discussion.

2.2. example: compactication on tori

a simple example of the above rule is provided by the gaussian model on t d with

constant background metric g and two-form b . we set e = g + b. (if we pick

rational values for the narain moduli, this case ts simply into the framework discussed

above; in the general quasirational case we will take some shortcuts below in showing that

the squared tension is given by a regularized dimension, given boundary states satisfying

the cardy condition.) the closed conformal eld theory is characterized by a narain
lattice (e)  ird,d. the isomorphism of u(1)d left and right chiral algebras is given by
n = r  n, where r  o(d; ir) is some rotation matrix [1,11,12].

let

 = (e)  {(pl; pr) : pl = r  pr}

(2.19)

7

we denote the rank of  by r and the metric tensor on  by gij . by this we mean the
metric appearing in the (euclidean) inner product p2
r = ntgn for a d dimensional
l + p2
vector of integers n. note that  depends on both e and r.

let  be a character of . cardy states will be of the form

|; e, rii = nx

e2ies(r)|i

(2.20)

where s(r) =pn nrn/n and we use the discrete measure for the momentum eigen-
vectors. let us ask that the single state |; e, rii form a cardy state. we compute

(qo)d xnzzr

eto ni(g1)ij nj

(2.22)

and we thus conclude that r = rank() = d. we interpret this to mean that d-branes
wrapped on foliating subtori of t d cannot form cardy states. moreover, the minimal
normalization is n = (detgij )1/4 and therefore, the overlap with the unit u(1)d character
is n = (detgij)1/4. equivalently, picking the tension out of the leading piece as qc  0
in the closed string channel,

dimh = (detgij)1/2

(2.23)

for example, choosing the diagonal torus with narain lattice (e) = { 12

( ni
ri 
+ miri)} and rotation r = diag{1p; +1dp} corresponding to a wrapped p-

miri; ni
ri
brane then one easily nds:

dimh =

ri

p

yi=1

d

yi=p+1

1
ri

(2.24)

if one adds a at b-eld and considers a d-brane wrapping t d then r = e1etr.

in this case one nds

dimh = (detgij )1/2 = | det(g + b )|(det g )1/2.

(2.25)

both of these agree with standard formulae for the mass of a wrapped brane when

one recalls that 1/g26d = pdet g /g26. in particular, (2.25) gives the sensible result
that the tension is given by the born-infeld action p| det(g + b)|, a result which is

essentially already to be found in [1].

3. the general argument: superstrings

3.1. cardy condition for n = 1 superconformal eld theory

to dene the superconformal algebra we need to pick a spin structure. the index set
i of characters divides into ns and r sectors which we denote as: i+ := ins, i := ir.
similarly, we must consider both characters and characters twisted by (1)f :

i (q) := trhi (f qh)


(3.1)

where  = 1. the transformation   1/ acts in a standard way on the spin structures,
so we can dene several modular matrices:

+

i (qc) = xji+
i (qc) = xji
i (qc) = xji+
i (qc) = xji

(3.2)

note that (s++)2 = c is the conjugation matrix (and for simplicity we will now assume
reps are self-conjugate). sij = ij because the witten index is modular invariant. 3

we can form character states |i; ii in the standard way.  denotes the choice of
isomorphism between left and right supercurrents so the character basis gives a basis of

solutions to the linear equations

(gr  i gr)|ii = 0

where r  zz in the r sector and r  zz + 1/2 in the ns sector.

we can form cardy states in the usual way:

remarks:

1. equation (3.3) is only one of several choices one must make in the isomorphism of left

and right chiral algebras.

2. in (3.4) we are considering a cardy set with states with xed  and which are either

purely ns or purely r. to make gso invariant states it is necessary to combine states

with dierent  as described below. we can also form cardy sets with states which are

linear combinations of character states from the r and ns sector, and this is required

in order to obtain bps boundary states. there are only minor modications to the

analysis.

3. in (3.7)  1

 () is independent of .
j  0, and if the unit operator is present then n++

j

is positive denite for

j = 0. thus, as for the bosonic string, we can conclude that the right hand side is

positive.

3.2. tension and dimension for the superstring

we begin with a product of superconformal theories c1(ir8d)  c2 where c1(ir8d)
is the lightcone superconformal eld theory of 8  d free bosons and fermions x , . c2
is a unitary superconformal eld theory with c = c = d. the closed string is a subtheory

10

because (a) we restrict to the subspace with the same spin structures on both factors and

(b) we gso project. the statespace has the form:

(h1

ns  h2

ns)+  (h1

r  h2

r)+.

(3.8)

where the + superscript indicates the need to take a gso projection. we will take the

brane to be a point particle in the uncompactied dimensions. the general form of the

boundary state is then [10]

c,ns,+|x, n s; ii(1)  |, n s; ii(2) + c,ns,|x, n s; ii(1)  |, n s; ii(2)

+c,r,+|x, r; ii(1)  |, r; ii(2) + c,r,|x, r; ii(1)  |, r; ii(2)
here we will assume the state is made from a cardy set of boundary states of the in-

(3.9)

ternal theory, although this is probably not necessary (i.e., only the combined theory really

needs to obey sewing axioms). the constants are determined by imposing the gso projec-

tion, by choosing bps or anti-bps branes,and by cardys condition. in supersymmetric
type ii theory the gso projection requires c,ns, = c,ns,+ and c,r,+ = c,r,.
note that the gso projection does not project out the unit operator in the internal the-

ory. other choices of gso projection will lead to other conditions on the coecients. for
example, in type 0 theory where one has a diagonal gso projection, c,ns,+ and c,ns,
are independent, reecting the doubling of the number of d-brane states [26].

the graviton vertex operator is   eikx  1 so the coupling of the state (3.9) to

the graviton is, up to a phase,

(c,ns,+  c,ns,)

 1

 ()

qs++

11

(3.10)

we can obtain a quantization condition on the coecient cns in order to ensure that

the combined state continues to satisfy the cardy condition. the condition depends on

whether or not we want to enforce the gso projection in the open string channel (i.e.

whether or not we consider a bps or a non-bps type brane). if we do not enforce the
condition then cr = 0 and 2|cns|2  zz+. taking the minimal value allowed we get the
open string ns sector is

(3.13)

here hns
 is the open string channel ns sector of the full string theory. in particular, this
result holds for bps and nonbps, the dierence of a factor of 2 in the tension between a
bps and non-bps brane [27] is due to the factor of 1/2 in the projection operator which
reduces the dimension of hns

 by a factor of two.

4. discussion

we conclude with two speculative remarks on possible future applications of this work.

first, it is natural to speculate that the mass formula derived here in terms of the

aeck-ludwig degeneracy g

m2  |g|2 = trh (1)

(4.1)

could play a role in extensions of the attractor mechanism [28] to nonsupersymmetric,
spherically symmetric charged black holes. in the context of bps black holes in n = 2
supersymmetric compactications to four dimensions, it is clear that g can be identied
with the central charge |z|. the attractor mechanism tells us that we should associate
spherically symmetric extremal rr charged black holes with gradient ow on the moduli
space using the zamolodchikov metric and the potential log|z|  log(g) [29,30]. since g
is intrinsically well dened in string theory without any reference to supersymmetry, one

can conjecture that in general compactications, one can associate spherically symmetric

extremal rr charged black hole solutions with gradient ows using the zamolodchikov

4 thus changing the orientation so that we have two ingoing circles. this is necesary to get

the spacetime fermion minus sign.

12

metric and the potential log(g). the doubly extremal solutions (with constant values

of the closed string moduli as a function of the radius) then arise when one chooses the

moduli to sit at a (local) minimum of g. it would also be interesting to see if the dynamical

evolution of couplings on a test 3-brane falling into a black hole is related to renormalization

group ow of the boundary entropy.

second, our result ts in well with the currently emerging interconnections between

d-branes, k-theory, and noncommutative geometry. in the framework of noncommutative

geometry formulae have been derived for the energy of wrapped d-branes in [31] and
subsequent papers. see [32] for a recent discussion. in order to account for the mass m
of a wrapped d-brane in its groundstate one must add to the noncommutative yang-mills

action a term proportional to tre(1), where e is the projective module of sections of the
(noncommutative) chan-paton bundle. on the other hand, in the present paper we have
derived a relation of the form m2  trh (1). the two results are compatible if we can
identify (at least in the   0 limit corresponding to the ncsym theory) h = end(e),
and such an identication in this limit is strongly suggested by the behavior of the nite

dimensional chan-paton factors. clearly, this connection deserves closer scrutiny.

it is also worth noting that in the theory of operator algebras one can dene the
murray-von neumann dimension,5 which assigns a continuous dimension to certain hilbert

spaces of operators. it is well-known that, at least in some rcfts, the regularized di-

mensions (2.17) are indeed given by ratios of such murray-von neumann dimensions. in

this way the jones index of subfactors appears in rcft. on the other hand, these same

dimensions can be related to traces of projection operators on towers of nite-dimensional

multimatrix algebras [33]. analogous constructions applied to the algebra of open string

vertex operators might lead to interesting new ways of formulating d-branes, and, perhaps,

even m -theory.
