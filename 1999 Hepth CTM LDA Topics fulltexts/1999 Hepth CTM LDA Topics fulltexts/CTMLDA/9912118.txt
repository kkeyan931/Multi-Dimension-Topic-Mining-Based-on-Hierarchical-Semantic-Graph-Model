(3.2) straightforward show 5-dimensional equations motion rab = 42gab satised provided solution ()r = 3, (3.3) brane solutions constructed manner previous section, excising region r > r1 introducing boundary brane tension given (2.3). metric brane given a2(r0). argument valid euclidean lorentzian metrics. equation (3.3) interpreted 4-dimensional einstein equations brane presence positive cosmological constant 4 = 3 a2(r0) 3h 2. one solution (3.3) de sitter space, solution chosen. previous section, may optionally introduce second brane negative tension (2.15) r1 < r0, excising region r < r1. euclidean action system two branes tension located ri sepa- rated region ads bulk given 1 se = ia4(ri)z d4x r ricci scalar. energy momentum tensor given 16g5 z d5xg(25 r) +xi (3.4) tab = (8g5)15gab xi ia2ab(r ri), ab = 0 b equal r. using trace einstein equations, r elliminated (3.4), gives se = 1 12g5 z d5xg5 1 3 xi ia4(ri)z d4x. performing integrals se = 1 xi=0 (1)i coth(ri/) ri/ sinh2(ri/)! s(i) e , s(i) e = 4 3v () 8gh 2 . 8 (3.5) (3.6) (3.7) g = g5/ 4-dimensional newton constant (dened limit low energy world, eective tension brane close c matter density much lower c), hi = 1, v () (dimensionless) volume manifold metric . case single brane positive tension, rst term (3.6) present. also, limit r0 r1, , se s(0) e , turn reduces usual 4-dimensional action instanton metric a2(r0) cosmological constant 4 = 3h 2 0 . 4 noted one-brane 5-dimensional solutions form (3.1) general singular. indeed, (3.2), non-vanishing components 5-dimensional weyl tensor given c , therefore = ()c c 2 =() c 2/a4(r). unless ()c 2 = 0 (as case brane metric conformally at) invariant diverges vicinity r = 0. course, singularity occur case two branes. similar divergence occurs randall-sundrum solution  substitute 4-dimensional metric brane ricci metric ds2 = dy2 + a2(y)dxdx, (3.8) a(y) = e|y|/. case divergence ads horizon . exception occurs case 4-dimensional plane wave . reason plane waves null, invariant ()c 2 vanishes. cosmological case, ()c 2 vanish even linearized gravity waves. applies zero mode discussed previous section, therefore singular rindler horizon. however, believe indicates fundamental diculty. expansion modes instrument useful order nd greens function wave equation. instance, case slices discussed randall sundrum, kk modes singular ads horizon, yet gravitational eld created isolated sources brane (which computed using green function wave operator) non-singular . let us consider schwarzschild-de sitter solution brane: h 2d2 = f (r)dt 2 + dr2 f (r) + r2d2 (2). (3.9) f (r) = (1 h 2r2 2m/r) free parameter. hm 1, equation f (r) = 0 three real solutions. one negative two positive. two positive roots correspond black hole cosmological horizons respectively. hm 1 5-dimensional solution analogous black string described . large distances brane sinh(r/) (hm)1, physical size horizon a(r)hm much smaller ads radius . region, horizon black string locally resembles cylinder, entropically unstable fragment array spherical horizons total larger surface area . 9 parameter (3.9) increased, black hole horizon brane increases cosmological horizon decreases. extremal case horizons size nariai solution, = (33h)1 r = (3h)1. r, coordinates become inadequate case, since f tends zero. customary introduce small parameter , dened 27m 2h 2 = 1 32, new coordinates (, ) = 3ht , 3hr = (1 cos 2/6). black hole horizon = 0, whereas cosmological horizon = . limit 0, one nds nariai solution: d2 = 1 3 . (3.10) near extremal case, 5-dimensional solution qualitatively dierent black string. fact, appears much closer black cigar postulated ref. . potentially unstable regime a(r)hm arises r , scale factor behaves linearly r. region, horizon look like cylinder all. fact, spatial section horizon closes smoothly r = 0, looks like fig. 1, except vertical circles 2-spheres rather 4-spheres. therefore, usual argument horizon entropically unstable, breaking small spheres, cannot applied. instability may still expected near tip cigar, r = 0, c 2 diverges. shall argue, however, singularity r = 0 rather mild, may fact smoothed quantum uctuations. note, connection, even small zero mode perturbations near de sitter-brane solution, invariant c 2 diverges near r = 0. zero point uctuations corresponding modes, however, nite action inevitably occur. similar uctuations may expected smooth tip black cigar nariai-brane solution. well known, 4-dimensional nariai instanton euclideanized making substitution (3.10). corresponding euclidean solution product two 2-spheres s(2) s(2), limit r0 , action given (3.7) v () 4 = (4/3)2 ri = r0, sn e 2 3gh 2 (3.11) interestingly, action 4-dimensional nariai instanton curvature radius. compact instantons, se coincides gravitational entropy. hence, long size instanton large compared cut-o scale , entropy 5-dimensional solution coincides entropy brane-world boundary. actually true choice brane-world geometry, perhaps consequence deeper holographic principle. mentioned above, 5-dimensional instanton singular r = 0. however, introducing boundary small r, hawking-gibbons boundary term, a4 8g5 z k d4x = 3a3ra 16g5 v () 4 vanishes r 0 (here k extrinsic curvature). hence, boundary contribute action. since singularity mild, believe nariai-brane 10 instanton indeed represents legitimate saddle point giving main contribution pair-creation rate black cigars attached brane-world. rate obtained exponentiating dierence (3.11) action de sitter-brane solution, sds e gh 2 . gives usual 4-dimensional result  exp(/3gh 2). alternative scenario, singularity avoided introducing membrane negative tension, mentioned beginning section. suciently large absolute value tension, contribution second brane-world action negligible recover (3.11). finally, may speculate existence additional instantons describing pair creation black holes ination. one reason suspect existence instantons black cigar brane corrections respect schwarzschild solution, whereas instanton presented corrections respect nariai solution. however, recalled mass black holes considered arbitrary: related curvature de sitter miraculous cancellation corrections may occur special value mass. nevertheless leave door open possible existence completely non- singular solutions. existed, may slightly lower action ones considered here. however, even case expect action would similar low energy limit (since limit action instanton agrees four-dimensional nariai action). iv. ads black holes thermal instantons section shall consider instanton solutions black hole brane, bulk. assume scalar eld matter brane. since instanton compact, may interpret congurations describing birth brane-world contains bulk black hole. alternative interpretation give probability pair creation bulk black holes inside pre-existing inating brane-world, analogous creation black holes presence domain wall four dimensions . interpretation parallels one usually attributed 4d nariai solution. general form spherically symmetric euclidean space bulk schwarzschild-ads solution, given ds2 = a(r)dt 2 e + dr2 a(r) + r2d2 (3). (4.1) a(r) = 1 + r2 2 2 r2 , parameter related mass dimensional black hole. spherial brane introduced, trajectory given r = r(te), = (te). two identical 11 copies bulk bounded trajectory glued brane. choosing parameter te cosmological proper time brane, equations motion reduce euclidean version eq.

(4.3) taking derivative (4.2) using (4.3) obtain r = 2 r3 + r xe + 2 4 x 2 e! + 4g 2r 1 + 2 2 xe! . let 0 extremum v (). then, straightforward show static solution = 0 r2 0 = 22 = 1. (4.4) eective tension brane given = c + v (0). note radius brane mass parameter given terms energy density brane stationary point. bulk metric (4.1) conical singularity (r, te) plane r = 0, unless range angular variable te adjusted 0 < te = 4 lim rr+ (r r+) a(r) . r2 + = 1 2 (cid:16)2 + 42 2(cid:17) black hole horizon radius. temperature brane given inverse periodicity proper time, tb = 1a1/2(r0) = 1 2r+ . (4.5) hence temperature felt observers brane proportional inverse black hole radius. euclidean action thermal instanton calculated along lines discussed section ii, given se = 2r3 + g . 12 (4.6) note expression also follows area law. ve-dimensional point view, entropy system due area ads black hole, equal 42r3 + (two copies black hole must considered). since g5 = g, sbh = se = area/4g5. (4.7) incidentally, argument applied de sitter nariai instantons con- sidered previous sections. there, action equal minus one fourth total area cosmological black hole horizons, natural units. , black hole radius, r2 + , much larger ads radius. case, action instanton much larger (smaller absolute value) action nariai-brane instanton value eective brane tension (or 4-dimensional cosmological constant). hence, nucleation rate bulk black holes would suppressed compared nucleation rate black cigars brane. hand, thermal instanton interpreted describing creation hot universe nothing, interest consider evolution universe creation. described analytic continuation (4.2), 2 r r! r2 +(cid:18)8g = 1 3 (cid:19) + 2(cid:18) 4g 3 2 (cid:19) + 2 r4 , (4.8) density matter brane. similar usual friedmann equation evolution 4-dimensional universe einstein gravity. dier- ences third fourth terms right hand side equation. third term correction large densities already encountered section ii. last term, due presence black hole bulk, behaves point view four dimensions additional contribution matter density dilutes like radiation. possible presence additional term dilutes like radiation noted ref.  case spatially cosmology. there, analog appeared integration constant equations motion brane. shown above, term corresponds existence black hole bulk . fact, spherically symmetric massive object bulk (or even massive parallel brane-world concentrical ours) would cause eect. additional term arise case maximally symmetric de sitter-brane instanton. principle would present universe born via thermal instanton. however, since universe must inate creation, seems post-inationary epoch reasonable choice integration constant zero. recently, much interest so-called ads/cf correspondence, possible duality relation classical gravity dimensional ads bulk conformal eld theory living boundary . context, last term eq.
