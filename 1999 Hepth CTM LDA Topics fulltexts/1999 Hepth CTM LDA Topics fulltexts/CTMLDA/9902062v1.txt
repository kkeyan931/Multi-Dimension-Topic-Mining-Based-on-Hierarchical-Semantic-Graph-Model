abstract

a regular method is suggested for constructing vortex-like solu-
tions with cylindrical symmetry in the skyrme - einstein chiral model.
the method is based on the expansion of metric and eld functions
in power series with respect to the two small parameters entering the
model. the length mass density of the vortex is estimated.

1 introduction

the skyrme chiral model [1] proved its eciency in modelling the
structure of baryons and light nuclei [2] via soliton-like congurations
endowed with the topological charge (winding number), the latter
being interpreted as the baryonic one. recent years the interest to
general relativistic description of skyrmions arose in view of possible
astrophysical applications of topological solitons coupled to gravity
[3-5]. the economy of the skyrme - einstein model in treating nu-
clear and gravitational interactions of matter being its very attractive
feature, one should however indicate the nonintegrability of the equa-
tions of motion that forced the authors of the aforementioned papers
to use numerical methods. in lieu of keeping up with this tradition
we elaborate in the present work an analytic method of solving the
equations for vortex congurations with the aim to approximate three-
dimensional structures by closed vortices and to expand, in future, this
method to the congurations with spherical or axial symmetry.

2 equations of the skyrme - einstein
model: neutral vortex case

the lagrangian density of matter in the model in question can be
constructed from the chiral current l = u +u,  = 0, 1, 2, 3, u 
su (2), and reads

lm = 

1
42 sp (ll) +

2
16

sp([l, l ][l, l]),

(1)

where ,  are constant parameters. for the congurations with cylin-
drical symmetry the metric is chosen in the form

ds2 = e2dt2  e2d2  e2d2  e2dz2,

(2)

where the functions , , ,  depend on the radial coordinate  
(, +). as a rst step we consider the simplest case of the neutral
vortex, when the chiral matrix u is taken in the form

u = exp(i ()),

 = " 0

# .

(3)

putting (3) into (1) and taking into account of the einsteinian
gravity lagrangian density lg = r/2, where r is the scalar curva-
ture and  is the einstein gravitational constant, one nds the follow-
ing expression for the action functional:

e(  +  +

a = 2z dtz dzz de+(cid:20) 1



+  ) 

1

 2e(+)2 sin2 i .

22 (cid:16)e2 + e sin2 (cid:17) 

one infers from (4) that the theory admits the discrete symmetry
  . therefore making the substitution  =  and imposing the
harmonic coordinate condition [6]

 =  + 2,

one transforms the functional (4) as follows:

a = 2z dtz dzz d(cid:20) 1

16

(u2  v2)

2 sin2 )

22 2 
22 euv sin2 (cid:21),

(4)

(5)

(6)

where u = 4( + ), v = 4.

the functional (6) admits the evident scale symmetry:

  , z  z, u  u  2 ln , v  v,

(7)

that will be used later for simplifying the asymptotic behavior of so-
lutions at space innity.

now we introduce the dimensionless parameters in the problem by

scale dilation:

  x, z  z, v  v + 2 ln 2, u  u + ln 2,

where 2 = 22. then we come to the quasimechanical problem with
x playing the role of time and with the hamiltonian action (mea-
sured in the units 2/2) of the form

1

s =



(u2  v2) 

2 z dx(cid:20) 1
 2(1 + 22ev/2 sin2 )  euv sin2 i ,

where  = 8/2. if one uses the natural units h = c = 1 and the
experimental value of the parameter  = 2/f, f = 186 mev, then
one gets   1.26  1038. the other dimensionless constant  appear-
ing in the functional (8) takes the experimental value [7]   0.13.
thus there exist two small parameters in the problem:   1038 and
2  102, that allows one to utilize the perturbation scheme.

first of all we write down the variational equations corresponding

to (8):

(11)

and the energy integral

(u2  v2) + euv sin2  = 2(1 + 2e v

2 sin2 ).

(12)

using the scale symmetry (7) we impose the regularity conditions

at space innity:

x  +, v  +, u  v  0,   o(ex),

(13)

and on the axis [6]:

x  ,

v  ,   ,

| u  v |< ,

v exp(cid:18) v  u

2 (cid:19)  4.

(14)

as follows from the equations (9) - (12), the regularity conditions (13)
and (14) imply the asymptotic behavior of solutions at space innity:

v = u = 4x,  = aex, a = const,

(15)

and on the symmetry axis:

v = va + 4dx, u = ua + 4dx,  =   bedx,

(16)

with the integration constants va, ua, d, b satisfying the constraint

d exp(cid:18) va  ua

(cid:19) = 1.

(17)

3 structure of vortex-like solutions

now we take into account of the mechanical analogy and rewrite the
eq. (12) in the form of hamilton - jacobi equation

s2

2 sin2 (cid:17) 
 = (cid:16)1 + 2e v
v ) + euv sin2 i .
h(s2
u  s2

(18)

due to small value of the parameter  we can represent the solution
to the eq. (18) as the power series expansion

s =

1


f + g + h +    .

(19)

inserting (19) into (18) and equating the terms with the same powers
in  order by order, we get the equations for the unknown functions
f, g, h,    . the equations for the function f read

f = 0,

(fu  fv)(fu + fv) = 0.

(20)

the asymptotic behavior (15) being equivalent to the relations (as
x  ):

fu = u = v = fv,

one concludes that the general solution to (20) turns out to be

f = f (u  v).

(21)

the form (21) of the function f implies the following equation

satised by the function g:

g2

2 sin2 )

 = (1 + 2e v
h2f (u  v)(gu + gv) + euv sin2 i .

(22)

the variables in the eq. (22) can be separated by the substitution

f (u  v) = 8e(uv)/2,

g = e(uv)/2

2nenv/2vn(),



xn=0

(23)

(24)

where the choice (23) is motivated by the nonuniform term in (22)
and by the asymptotic behavior (15). inserting (23) and (24) in (22)
one obtains the recurrence relations satised by the functions vn():

n

xk=0

v 
kv 

nk + 4(n  1) sin2 vn1 =

= n0 sin2  + n1 sin4  .

for n = 0 one derives from (25) and (15) that

v0 = 1  cos .

for n = 1 one gets, in view of (26), the equation

2 sin v 

1 + 4v1 = sin4 .

(25)

(26)

(27)

taking into account of the relations (15) and (16), one concludes
1 ()

that the solution v1() to the eq. (27) has the two branches v 
with the domains

d+ = {0   


2

}, d = {

   }.

the corresponding functions attain the forms:

v

1  cos 

+ 3  cos (cid:19) ,

v +

(1  cos ) sin2 .

(28)

for n  2 one obtains the following integral representation for the
solution to the eq. (25):

n = (cid:18) 1 + cos

(29)

where a+ = 0, a = .in particular, for n = 2 from (28) and (29) one
deduces that

within the scope of the rst two terms in the expansion (19) the

the system (31) should be complemented by the smooth matching

condition at the point x = x0, where (x0) = /2 :

6



xn=1

2nenv(x0)/2(cid:16)v +

n (/2)  v 

n (/2)(cid:17) = 0.

(32)

in particular, within the connes of n = 2 approximation the eq. (32)
allows us to nd, through the use of (28) and (30), the approximate
value of the eective expansion parameter

 =

2ev(x0)/2 =

(33)

now we can use (33) to estimate the mass length density of the

vortex in search dened as

m = 

2
2 s,

(34)

where s denotes the total variation of s(x) in the domains d :

s = s+()  s+(x0) + s(x0)  s() =

using (31) one gets in the rst approximation in  that

u = v = 4x + o().

(35)

(36)

inserting (36) into (35) and taking into account of (28) and (30), one
nds up to  2 terms that

s  2  4  2 2(cid:18) 41

(37)

substituting (37) into (34) one gets, in view of (33), the approximate
value of the vortex mass

m

(38)

as for the structure of the function (x) dening the radial distri-
bution of matter inside the vortex,as well as those of the functions u(x)
and v(x) describing the gravitational eld, they can be derived from
the system (31) through the use of the standard iteration technique.

4 discussion

in conclusion it is worthwhile to underline that we considered here
the case of the neutral vortex not endowed with the topological charge

7

density. therefore after closing the vortex piece we come to the cong-
uration with zero baryon number q, this fact ensuing from the formula
for the winding number

q = 

1

242 ijk z d3x sp(li lj lk).

(39)

however, this shortcoming can be cured by generalizing the substitu-
tion (3) with the aim to generate the topological charge density in the
vortex. to this end one can try the following ansatz:

u = cos  exp (i3) + i1 sin  exp (i3),

(40)

where 1, 3 are the pauli matrices and , ,  stand for the chiral
angles represented in the cylindrical coordinates , , z as follows:

 = (),  = kz(a  ),  = m,

(41)

with k = const, m  z. the radius a , entering the argument of the
heaviside step function , is chosen to satisfy the piece-wise smooth
matching condition cos (a) = 0 . in the simplest case we can impose
the following boundary conditions:

(0) = , (a) =


2

, () = 0,

(42)

and also the closure one:

k l = 2n, n  z, z  [

l
2

,

l
2

],

(43)

where l stands for the length of the vortex piece. inserting (40) into
(39) yields, in virtue of (41), (42) and (43), the nontrivial baryon
number

q =

(44)

1

42 z d3x sin 2 ([]) = mn.

thus, the suggested substitution meets all necessary requirements.
the analysis of the skyrme - einstein vortex congurations endowed
with the topological charge density will be exhibited in the subsequent
paper.
