(7) (8) = d/dy. formally, expression coincides eective action time dependent conformally background, physics course dierent. one also remember total eective action consists w plus conformally invariant functional. case conformally background, considered here, conformally invariant functional non-essential constant. one considers periodicity coordinates (say, ads bh) constant become important, kind casimir energy, since depend radius compact dimension. order take account quantum matter eects ads universe add anomaly-induced action classical gravitational action scl = 1 z d4xg (r + 6) = 1 z d4x e4(6e2(()2 + ()) + 6) . (9) sum classical action quantum eective action describes dynamics whole quantum system. equations motion following action scl + w 4aa a2 3(a)2 a2 +(cid:18)6 6 b1 b(cid:19) a(a)2 a3 + 6b1(a)4 ba4 4b(cid:16)12a 24a3(cid:17) = 0 . (10) prime means derivative respect y. one may look special ads-like solutions eq. (10): = c/y. quantum corrections, solution c = 1/, accordance ads metric. eective cosmological constant = 0, eq. (10) reduces c2 = b1 (at a(y) = c/y). however, c2 = b1 leads imaginary scale factor a, b1 < 0. indicates matter corrections alone create anti-de sitter universe. contrast possibility creation de sitter universe solely matter quantum eects . indeed, scale factor depends time sign curvature (which positive) changing. result, = c/ c2 = b1. words, always solution - form quantum created de sitter universe! contrary, presence negative eective cosmological constant classical theory necessary condition existence anti-de sitter universe, least within scenario. general case, algebraic equation c2 becomes (assuming < 0): solutions: b1 c2 c4 = 0 , c1 2 = 1 2(cid:16)1 +p1 + 4b1(cid:17) 3 (11) (12) c2 2 = 1 2(cid:16)1 p1 + 4b1(cid:17) . (13) rst solution corresponds quantum corrected anti-de sitter universe. here, start- ing bare (even small!) negative cosmological constant, get anti-de sitter universe smaller cosmological constant due quantum corrections. quan- tum corrections act existing anti-de sitter universe make less stable. mechanism annihilation anti-de sitter universe. second solution corresponds imaginary scale factor since c2 < 0. complete eective action solution a(y) = c/y scl + w = v3z dy = v3z dy y4"6b1 ln c2 y4"6b1 ln c2 y2! 8(b + b1) y2! 8b 14b1 + 6(c4 c2) # . 12c2 # (14) dependence eective action c2 seen. thus, shown quantum corrections already existing anti-de sitter universe make less stable, whereas creation anti-de sitter universe quantum corrections alone impossible. contrast de sitter universe, may created quantum corrections alone. interesting understand role eects scenario. consider presence dilaton. related dilatonic terms action may play role eective cosmological constant. 3. explicit example theory dilaton appears conformal anomaly consider n = 4 su(n ) super ym theory covariantly coupled background n = 4 conformal supergravity (see  introduction). corresponding vector multiplet (a, i, xij). also complex scalar (axion dilaton) conformal supergravity multiplet. note theory realistic one. purely bosonic background conformal anomaly theory following  = b(cid:18)f + 2 3 r(cid:19) + b1g + b2r + c(cid:20) 2(cid:18)r 1 3 g r(cid:19) (cid:21). (15) last term, constant c = n 2 1 (4)2 , contribution dilaton axion elds. note also adjoint representation nv = n 2 1, ns = 6nv nf = 2nv theory discussion. using conformal anomaly (15), following ref. {$9902418$}, dicult con- struct anomaly-induced eective action w conformally background, g = e2 . depending time, one gets, terms conformal time {$9902418$}, w = v3z dh2b1 2(b + b1)( + ()2) + c re()i, (16) 4 v3 three-dimensional volume, = d/d. usual, complete eective action sum two terms: w conformally invariant functional w1. since discuss conformally background, w1 depend complex scalar , constant constant. supposing w1 local functional (so schwingerde witt expansion may used), left one possibility, w1 = v3z re() ln 2 . (17) coecient w1 depends regularization used, since may absorbed scale , redenition. thus quantum correction classical action = w + w1. usual choice complex scalar = + ie , (18) dilaton, r-r scalar (axion) type iib supergravity (or conformal supergravity, above). thus, nal expression one-loop eective action n = 4 super yangmills theory coupled conformal supergravity conformally background = v3z dh2b1 2(b + b1)( + ()2) + (c + a) re()i , (19) constant depending regularization, = + ie. one may consider case large n , large n expansion proper quantum gravity corrections next-to-leading order. dierent choices classical gravitational action. example, one consider axion-dilatonic gravity gibbonsgreenperry {$9905111$}, describes bosonic sector type iib supergravity, scl = 1 z d4xg (cid:18)r + 1 2 g + 1 2 e2 g (cid:19) . (20) absence dilaton axion, reduces standard action general rel- ativity. using choice conformally metric one may simplify eq. (20) follows, scl = 1 v3z d(cid:18)6e2 (()2 + ()) + 1 2 e2 ()2 + 1 2 e2+2 ()2(cid:19) . (21) convenient transform cosmological time t, dt = a() = e() d. equations motion may obtained variations respect a, . consider simpler choice axion equal zero, kinetic term dilaton classical action absent. regularization = 0 also chosen. result one comes model discussed ref.{$9902418$}. study corresponding eective equations time-dependent conformally metric done work. possibility quantum creation de sitter universe proved. one give analysis related quantum corrected anti-de sitter universe way done previous section. note, however, case discussion classical cosmological constant result anti-de sitter solution classical level. 5 eective equations motion take form: 4aa a2 3a2 a2 + 6aa2 a3 (cid:18)1 b1 b(cid:19) + 6b1a4 ba4 + 3aa b c 4b = 0 , ln + (ln ) = 0 . (22) prime means derivative put = . motivated ref. {$9902418$} one make following transformation: dz = a(y) dy . (23) then, terms variable z rst equations (22) is: a2 .... +3a ... +aa2 (cid:18)5 + 6b1 b (cid:19) a2a + 3 b(cid:16)a2a + a2(cid:17) c  4b = 0 . (24) = da/dz,  given ref. {$9902418$}, second equation (22) (in terms z) also given ref. {$9902418$} (eq.

(24) one obtains: h 2 1 (cid:20)b1 + c 24 0 2(cid:16)4 63 + 112 6(cid:17)(cid:21)1 . (27) rst term denominator always negative, second term may positive 2 hz (i.e. = 3/2. then, special dilaton solution (z) = 1 e 2 > 12 one gets positive h 2 and, hence, non- 2 = 3 = 0) condition 1 imaginary scale factor ads universe. thus, occurs possibility quantum creation dilatonic ads universe, requires strong ne-tuning dilatonic solution. is, course, non-realistic situation. note corresponding ads scale factor is: 3 a(y) = 1 hy . (28) one analyze eqs. (22) numerically qualitative result; special initial conditions dilaton scale factor quantum creation ads universe possible. however, cases process occur. thus, demonstrated quantum eects conformal matter support creation ads universe. moreover, already existing classical ads universe annihi- lating due quantum eects. dilaton-gravitational background (maximally susy 6 ym theory) dilatonic contribution conformal anomaly induced ef- fective action quantum eects may create ads universe subject strong ne-tuning. however, probability creation much less process de sitter universe similar conditions. model discussion maybe understood also simplied model creation- annihilation ads black hole. taking additional contribution eective action due geometrical structure ads bh one repeat analysis realistic situation. unfortunately, additional piece eective action known closed form. another side, inclusion non-trivial axion maybe also done. however, case numerical analysis equations motion possible. acknowledgments. work sdo supported part norwegian research council rfbr grant n99-02-16617. extremely grateful jan myrheim participation early stage work helping preparation draft ms. also thank kare olaussen shinichi nojiri useful discussions.
