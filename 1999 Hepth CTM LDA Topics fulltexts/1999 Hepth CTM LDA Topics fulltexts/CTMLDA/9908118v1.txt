abstract

we dene a semi-hopf algebra which is more general than a hopf alge-
bra. then we construct the supersymmetry algebra via the adjoint action
on this semi-hopf algebra. as a result we have a supersymmetry theory
with quantum gauge group, i.e., quantised enveloping algebra of a simple lie
algebra. for the example, we construct the lagrangian n =1 and n =2
supersymmetry.

introduction

supersymmetry was introduced in the seventy decades by golfand-likht-
man, volkov-akulov, wess-zumino, and salam-strathdee[1]. this super-
symmetry has been the subject of intense research in particle physics which
promises the grand unication theory, also in eld and string theory. the
recent development in supersymmetric eld theory is to nd a generalized
supersymmetry theory via the notion of duality.
it was begin by seiberg
and witten[3] who considered the n =2 supersymmetric su(2) yang-mills
theory.
on the other hand, drinfeld and jimbo[4] generalized the lie group
(called quantum group) via noncommutative and non-co-commutative hopf
algebra. this quantum group has been applied in gauge theory[8,9,10]. this
implies that the eld theory become no longer commutative. so it is uneasy
to dene the variation of action and its quantum theory. a dierent approach
introduced in [14] has successfuly handled this noncommutative problem in
dening the variation of the action.

in this paper, we start with the denition of a semi-hopf algebra which
is more general than a hopf algebra, then we construct the supersymmetry
algebra via this semi-hopf algebra. as a result we have a supersymmetry
theory with quantum gauge group uq (g), i.e., quantised enveloping algebra of
a simple lie algebra g which is dened by lyubashenko and sudbery[7]. the
eld (or supereld) become noncommutative that we handle by dening a
noncommutative invariant scalar product between two elds (or supereld).
so we can construct the lagrangian n =1 and n =2 supersymmetry by
the scalar product between two supereld and do not worry about the non-
commutative factor. it is also straightforward to dene the variation of the
action and then get the usual equation of motion. we use the notation for
the supersymmetry as was given by wess-bagger[2].

this paper is organized as follows.

in section ii we briey review the
denition of a hopf algebra given by tjin[6] and then we dene a semi-
hopf algebra which is more general structure than a hopf algebra. then we
construct the supersymmetry algebra via this semi-hopf algebra and dene
the general jacobi identity in section iii. the denition a noncommutative
invariant scalar product and the construction of n =1 and n =2 supersym-
metry lagrangian via superspace formalism, and the n =2 prepotential are

2

presented in section iv. section v is devoted for conclusion and outlook.

ii. semi-hopf algebra

before dening the notion of semi-hopf algebra, we start with the deni-
tion and elementary properties of hopf algebra[5]. this hopf algebra contains
all the information on the algebraic structure of the lie group while a semi-
hopf algebra contains all the information on the algebraic structure of the
super-lie group (as we will see later).

in this paper we use the notation and the denition of a hopf algebra
given by tjin[6] and briey introduce hopf algebraic structure. then we
dene a semi-hopf algebra which is more general than a hopf algebra.

denition 1 let a is a linear space over the ground eld c. a bi-algebra
is the set (a, m, , , ) with the following properties :

1) (a, m, ) is unital assosiative algebra, where

m : a  a  a

 : c  a

(2.1)

(2.2)

2) a map  : a  a  a satises
i)  is linear
ii)  is an algebra homomorphism
iii) (  id)  = (id  ) 
3) a map  : a  c such that

(co-associativity)

(id  )  = (  id)  = id

(2.3)

denition 2 a hopf algebra is a bi-algebra (a, m, , , ) together with a
map

with the following properties

s : a  a

3

(2.4)

m (s  id)  = m (id  s)  =   

(2.5)

where s is an antipode.

some example of a hopf algebra can be seen in[4-9]. we interested in
constructing an algebra which contain the algebraic structure of the super-
lie group. so we dene an algebra (which we called semi-hopf algebra) as
follows :

denition 3 a semi-hopf algebra is a bi-algebra (b, m, , , ) with the
following properties :

1) there exist q  b such that

m (id  id) (q) =   (q)

2) there exist b  b and b 6= q such that

m (s  id) (b) = m (id  s) (b) =   (b)

where s is an antipode

(2.6)

(2.7)

we can choose   (a) = (a) ib for a  b with ib is an identity element
of b [4]. both of the above condition does not compatible to each other. it
means that if q  b satises the condition (2.6), then q does not satisfy the
condition (2.7) and vice versa.

the denition 3 implies the following proposition :

proposition 4 a hopf algebra is subalgebra of a semi-hopf algebra.

in the next section, we will construct a supersymmetry algebra via a
semi-hopf algebra where the odd elements, as we will dene later, satises
the condition (2.6)

4

iii. semi-hopf algebra and supersymmetry algebra

in this section we start to construct supersymmetry algebra via the semi-

hopf algebra as we introduced above.

let b be a bi-algebra generated by p, j, qi

, q i,er, fr , qhr , i, j

with coproduct , antipode s, and counit  dened by

(cid:1) = qi

 (p) = p  i + i  p ,  (j) = j  i + i  j ,
 , (cid:16)q i(cid:17) =q i i + j q i
(cid:0)qi
 (er) = er  qhr + qhr  er ,  (fr) = fr  qhr + qhr  fr ,
(cid:0)qhr(cid:1) = qhr  qhr,  (j) = j  j ,  (i) = i  i ,

  i + j  qi

(3.1)

,

s (p) = p , s (j) = j , s(cid:0)qi
s(cid:16)q i(cid:17) =  q i , s (er) = q1
s(cid:0)qhr(cid:1) = qhr, s (j) = j , s (i) = i ,

(cid:1) = qi

 ,

r er , s (fr) = qr fr ,

(3.2)

(3.3)

 (p) =  (j) = (cid:0)qi
(cid:1) = 0 ,
(cid:16)q i(cid:17) =  (er) =  (fr) = 0 ,
(cid:0)qhr(cid:1) =  (j) =  (i) = 1 ,

where q is a xed elements of ground eld c, qr = qhhr , hri and h,i denotes
the killing form in cartan subalgebra. the operator j acts on the generator
of b as

 = qi

 , j q i=  q i ,

jqi
jp = p , jj = j , jer = er ,
jfr = fr , jqhr = qhr .

(3.4)

5

it can be seen from the above equation that the basis element of b consist
 and q i because they have 1 parity and the

of the odd elements, i.e., qi
rest are even, i.e., p, j, er, fr , qhr because they have +1 parity.

the odd elements, i.e., qi

 and q i, turn out to satisfy the condition (2.6)
while the even elements, i.e., p, j, er, fr , qhr, satisfy the condition
(2.7). so it is sucient for b to be a semi-hopf algebra.

we dene the adjoint action of b on itself, given by x  ad x  endc b

where

ad x (y)  x x(1) y s(cid:0)x(2)(cid:1) = [x, y] ,

(3.5)

if  (x) = p x(1)  x(2) . for odd-odd element the adjoint action become

hqi
, q ji = qi
(cid:3) = qi
, qj
(cid:2)qi
hq i, q ji = q iq j + q j q i

 q j + q j qi
 qj

 ,

 + qj

 qi

 ,

(3.6)

and for odd-even element (the even element only p, j ) the adjoint action
become

(cid:2)qi
, p(cid:3) = qi
(cid:2)qi
, j(cid:3) = qi

 p  p qi
 ,
 j  j qi

 ,

(3.7)

and for even-even element (only p, j) similar to equation (3.7). thus,
we can identify qi
 and q i as supersymmertry generator, p and j as
the energy-momentum operators, and the lorentz rotation generators (anti-
symmetric tensor) respectively with , =0,1,2,3 (spacetime index with the
metric  =diag(1,1,1,1)), i is the number of supersymmetry generators,
and the fermionic index ( ) =1( 1), 2( 2). the rest even elements, i.e., er,
fr , qhr are generator of the simply-connected quantised enveloping algebra
uq (g) and g is a simple lie algebra[7], where r is the number of fundamen-
tal roots of g . a quantum lie algebra gq is a subspace of uq (g) satisfying
certain properties[7,8]. so we can construct the elements of gq (denoted t a

6

with a is the numbers of basis element) from er, fr , qhr . in this case the
coproduct of the elements of gq are the form [7,8]

and

 (t a) = t a  c + ua

b  t b ,

ad ua

b (t c) = ac

db t d ,

(3.8)

(3.9)

where c is a central element of uq (g) and  is the quantum ip operator (
a deformation of the classical ip operator : ac

b when q =1).

db = c

d a

as we see from equation (3.6) and (3.7), the adjoint action of b have a
z2 graded structure to preserve the closure property. thus we can dene the
adjoint action on the basis elements of b as

[p, p] = [p, t a] = [j, t a] = 0 ,

through (3.13) is called general supersymmetry algebra. the second and

coleman-mandula theorem[12].

iv. uq (g) supersymmetry

in the previous section, we have the general supersymmetry algebra (
equation (3.10) through (3.13)), i.e., the supersymmetry algebra with quan-
tum gauge group uq (g). this algebra implies that the massless and massive
mutiplet are precisely the same as the supersymmetry with classical gauge
group. the dierence is that in this theory we have noncommutative elds
(or superelds) in each multiplet. so we need to dene the noncommutative
factor between two dierent elds (or superelds). some example for the
gauge theory are in references [8,9,10]. it is a complicated problem to dene
the variation of action of the theory. fortunately, the noncomutative invari-
ant property of the scalar product between two elds ( or superelds) bring
us out of this problem.

a. noncommutative factor and metric

denition 5 let a1 and b2 are two dierent kind of eld (or supereld)
in 1 and 2 representation, respectively. then there exist a factor ba1b2
such
c2 d1
that

a1 

b2 = ba1b2
c2 d1

c2

d1

(4.1)

is called the noncommutative factor.

ba1b2
c2 d1
.

the noncommutative factor ba1b2
c2 d1

is an nn  nn matrix with n is the
dimension of 1 representation and n is the dimension of 2 representation.
, 1 = 2 =  then the

if  and  have the same representation, i.e.

noncommutative factor become

a 

(4.2)
,c d is an n 2  n 2 matrix with n is the dimension of the  represen-
ad, cd = ab
cd,

where ab
tation. for special case, if  is an adjoint representation then ab
where  is the quantum ip operator dened in [7,8].

b = ab

, c d c

d ,

9

denition 6 let  and  are two dierent kind of elds (or superelds) in
the  representation. the product of two elds (or superelds)

is calleda noncommutative invariant scalar product if it satises

ga b a b  a a

a a = a a .

(4.3)

in the rest of this paper, the noncommutative invariant scalar product

will be simply called the scalar product. the function ga b has form

ga b = tr (u ea eb) ,

(4.4)

where ea and eb are basis of the  representation, u = p s (r2)r1 being
the quantum trace element of uq (g) and r = pr1  r2 its universal r-

matrix. we have that the function ga b contracting the upper index to the
lower index, that is

b = a ,
and vice versa. the function ga b also satises

ga b 

ga bg b c = a
c .

proposition 7 the function ga b satises ga b ab

, c d = gc d .

for the adjoint representation, we have

gab = tr (u adt a adt a) ,

(4.5)

(4.6)

and for the suq (2) see sudbery[7,8].

note that it is straightforward to dene the variation of the lagrangi- an

: let l (, ,) be a lagrangian, then we dene the variation of l as

l =a l

a + a

,

l
a
,

,

(4.7)

where  is a eld and , = /x. we cancel the surface term and then
get the usual equation of motion.

10

b. n =1 scalar and vector multiplet
1. n =1 scalar multiplet

the n =1 scalar multiplet is represented by a chiral supereld  = aea

and can be expanded as

 (y, ) =  (y) + 2  (y) + 2 f (y) ,

(4.8)
where y = x +i  , x are spacetime coordinates,  ,  are anticommuting
coordinates, and  are the pauli matrices. here,  and  are the scalar and
fermionic components respectively and f is an auxiliary eld required for
the o-shell representation.

similarly, an anti-chiral supereld is represented by  = , aea and can

be expanded as

(cid:0)y, (cid:1) = (cid:0)y(cid:1) + 2  (cid:0)y(cid:1) + 2 f (cid:0)y(cid:1) ,

(4.9)

the lagrangian for the scalar multiplet is the scalar product of a chiral

where y, = x,  i   .
and an anti-chiral supereld

l = z , aa d4 = (, a)(a)  i a  + f , a fa ,
where d4 = d2 d2  .

(4.10)

2. n =1 vector multiplet

this multiplet is represented by a real supereld satisfying v  = v . using

the abelian gauge transformation

where () are chiral (anti-chiral) supereld, a, b are coecient, and s is
an antipode, we can write v as

v  v + a  + b s(cid:0)(cid:1) ,

(4.11)

v =    a + i2   i2  +

2 2 d ,

1
2

(4.12)

11

the so called wess-zumino gauge. the abelian eld strength is dened by

w =

d2dv , w  = 

1
4

d2 d v ,

(4.13)

where d2 = dd and d2 = d  d , and d, d  are the super-covariant
derivatives[2]. w is a chiral supereld.

in the non-abelian case, v belongs to the adjoin representation of the
gauge group uq (g) : v = va ad t a . the gauge transformations are now
implemented by

e2v  x h(1)(cid:0)(cid:1) e2v s(cid:0)h(2) ()(cid:1) ,
e2v  x h(1) () e2v s(cid:0)h(2)(cid:0)(cid:1)(cid:1) ,

(4.14)

if  (h) = p h(1)  h(2) , where  = a ad t a and  = 

non-abelian gauge eld strength is dened by

a ad t a . the

w =

d2 e2v d e2v , w  =

(4.15)

and as we expect they transform as

in components, it takes the form

w 

  x h(1) () w s(cid:0)h(2) ()(cid:1) .

(4.16)

w = (cid:18)ia, +  da

3. n =1 vector multiplet couple with matter

let  be a chiral supereld belong to a  representation of the gauge
group uq (g). the kinetic term , aa is invariant under the global gauge
transformation  = h()  and  =  s (h()) with  a real parameter.
in the local case, to insure that  and  remain a chiral and anti-chiral
supereld,  and  have to be a chiral and anti-chiral supereld, respectively.
so the local gauge transformation of a chiral and an anti-chiral supereld
become

 = h()  ,

(4.19)

respectively. the supersymmetric gauge invariant kinetic term is given by

 =  s(cid:0)h()(cid:1) ,

(4.20)
then the lagrangian n =1 vector multiplet couple with the kinetic matter
term is

 e2gv  .

l =

8

im(cid:18) z d2 w a,  wa, (cid:19) +z d4  e2gv  .

(4.21)

in terms of the supereld components, the above lagrangian takes the form

l =

where

  =  + ig a  .

the above lagrangian is invariant under the supersymmetry variations,  =
 q +   q  , i.e.,

(4.23)

 a = ia    i   a ,
 da =  a       a ,
 a =   f a
 + i  da ,
a =   f a
  i  da ,

  = 2  ,
  = 2  f + i2  ()
  = 2  f  i2   ()
 f = i2()

     2i   .

  ,
 ,



we see from the above equation that the supersymmetry variations of eld
in this theory are precisely the same as the classical internal symmetry group
of supersymmetry[2].

c. n =2 vector multiplet

n =2 vector multiplet consist of elds ,  and a ,  in a single multiplet.
this means that all elds must be in the same representationof the gauge
group uq (g) as a, i.e., in the adjoint representation. so, the lagrangian
n =2 vector multiplet is the lagrangian (4.21)( or (4.22)) with the matter
multiplet in the adjoint representation, i.e.,

l = im(cid:18) 

8 (cid:20)z d2 w a,  wa,  + 2z d4  e2gv (cid:21)(cid:19) ,

(4.24)

14

with scaling   /g .
the lagrangian n =2 vector multiplet can be constructed by using n =2
superspace formalism[11]. the n =2 chiral supereld is introduced as follows
(4.25)

 =  (y, ) + 2 w (y, ) + 2 g (y, ) ,

where y = x + i    + i  
coordinates. then the lagrangian (4.24) can be written as


 and  ,


 are addition anti-commuting

l =

(4.26)

with

g (y, ) = z d2  (cid:0)y, + i  , , (cid:1) exp(cid:0)2g v (cid:0)y  i  , , (cid:1)(cid:1) .
the most general lagrangian for n =2 vector multiplet is

(4.27)

l =

(4.28)

4

8

im(cid:18)z d2 d2  f (q, ) (cid:19) ,
im(cid:18)(cid:20)z d2 w a,  w b

=

 fab (q, ) + 2z d4 (cid:0)  e2gv(cid:1)a

fa (q, )(cid:21)(cid:19) .
here, fa (q, ) = f /a, fab (q, ) = 2f /ab, and f is referred to
as the n =2 prepotential[3]. the second term in the above equation has
the kahler potential im(cid:0)  a fa (q, )(cid:1) which gives a metric on the space of
elds. seiberg and witten have determined exactly this function f for the
su(2) gauge group.

v. conclusion and outlook

we have dened a semi-hopf algebra which is more general than a hopf
algebra and we construct the supersymmetry algebra via the adjoint action
on this semi-hopf algebra. as a result we have a supersymmetry theory with
quantum gauge group uq (g), i.e., quantised enveloping algebra of a simple

15

lie algebra g . the eld (or supereld) become noncommutative that we
handled by dening the noncommutative invariant scalar product between
two elds (or supereld). we then construct the lagrangian of the n =1
and n =2 supersymmetry by the scalar product between two supereld and
do not worry about the noncommutative factor. we nd that the n =2
prepotential depends on a xed element q of the ground eld c and the
chiral supereld . we left the problems of nding r-matrix for the quasi-
semi-hopf algebra and the extended seiberg-witten theory of quantum gauge
group for further research.
