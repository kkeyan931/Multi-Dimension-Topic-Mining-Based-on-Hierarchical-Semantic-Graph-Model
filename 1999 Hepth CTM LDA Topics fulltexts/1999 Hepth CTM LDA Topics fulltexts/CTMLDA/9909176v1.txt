abstract

in string theory, d-branes can be expressed as a conguration of innitely
many lower dimensional d-branes. using this relation, the worldvolume the-
ory of d-branes can be regarded as the worldvolume theory of the innitely
many lower dimensional branes.
in the description in terms of the lower
dimensional branes, some of the worldvolume coordinates become noncom-
mutative. actually this noncommutative theory can be regarded as noncom-
mutative yang-mills theory. therefore the worldvolume theory of d-branes
have two equivalent descriptions, namely the usual static gauge description
using ordinary yang-mills theory and the noncommutative description using
noncommutative yang-mills theory. it will be shown that these two descrip-
tions correspond to two dierent ways of gauge xing of the reparametrization
invariance and its generalization. we will give an explicit relation between
commutative gauge eld and noncommutative gauge eld when the gauge
group is u(1).

1 introduction

many physicists are interested in noncommutative geometry, because they expect that
it captures some features of quantum gravity.
it is intriguing to see that in string
theory and m theory, which is considered to be the most promising model of quan-
tum gravity, we come across several occasions in which space-time coordinate becomes
noncommutative[1]-[14].
in this note we would like to discuss an example in which
noncommutativity of spacetime coordinates appears in string theory. the example we
study here is the worldvolume theory of d-branes. as was pointed out in [15, 16],
dp-branes can be represented as a conguration of innitely many d(p  2r)-branes. if
such a relation hold, the worldvolume theory of the dp-branes can also be regarded as
the worldvolume theory of innitely many d(p2r)-branes. we will show that some of
the coordinates on the worldvolume of the dp-branes become noncommutative if one
consider it as the worldvolume theory of d(p  2r)-branes. actually the noncommu-
tative theory we have is noncommutative yang-mills theory. such a noncommutative
description of the dp-branes should be equivalent to the usual commutative descrip-
tions. we will pursue this equivalence and show that these two descriptions correspond
to two dierent way to x the reparametrization invariance and its generalization on
the worldvolume. therefore we have here an example where a noncommutative theory
is equivalent to a commutative theory. such an equivalence in a similar context was
studied in a recent paper[17]. we will comment on the relation between our results
and theirs.

in section 2, we explain how dp-branes can be expressed as a conguration of
innitely many d(p  2r)-branes. in section 3, we study the worldvolume theory of the
dp-branes regarding it as a conguration of the d(p  2r)-branes. section 4 is devoted
to discussions.

this note is based on a talk presented at workshop on noncommutative dieren-
tial geometry and its application to physics, shonan-kokusaimura, japan, may31-
june 4, 1999.

2 dp-branes from d(p  2r)-branes

in this section we will explain how dp-branes can be expressed as a conguration of
innitely many d(p  2r)-branes. for simplicity, the special case of expressing one dp-
brane by d-instantons, namely p = 2r + 1 case, will be treated here. we will comment
on more general cases at the end of this section.

we study this problem in the euclidean space rd. 2 d should be 26 for bosonic
string and 10 for superstring. we will rst deal with bosonic string theory in which
the whole manipulations are simpler. later we will explain how one can generalize the
arguments to the superstring case. the conguration of innitely many d-instantons

2things discussed here are partially generalized to the space compactied on a torus in [18].

can be expressed by the    hermitian matrices x m (m = 1,    , d). the one we
consider is

x i = p i, (i = 1,    , p + 1)
x m = 0 (m = p + 2,    , d),

where p i (i = 1    , p + 1) satisfy

[ p i, p j] = iij.

(1)

(2)

in this note, the (p + 1)  (p + 1) matrix  is assumed to be invertible.

let us show that this conguration of d-instantons is equivalent to a dp-brane. in
order to show that two dierent congurations of d-branes are equivalent, one should
prove that the open string theory corresponding to these congurations are equivalent.
a quick way to see the equivalence is to look at the boundary states. the boundary

state |bi corresponding to the conguration eq.(1) can be written as follows:

|bi = trpeir 2

0

dpi p i

|bi1.

(3)

here pi() is the variable conjugate to the string coordinate xi() and is equal to 1
2 xi
|bi1 denotes the boundary state for a d-instanton at
in the usual at background.
the origin and satises xi()|bi1 = 0.
|bi1 includes also the ghost part which is
not relevant to the discussion here. the factor in front of |bi1 is an analogue of the
wilson loop and corresponds to the background eq.(1). eq.(3) can be rewritten by
using path integral as

|bi = z [dp ]e

i

2 r dp ip jij ir dpip i

|bi1,

(4)

where ij = (1)ij.

it is straightforward to perform the path integral in eq.(4). using the fock space
representation of |bi1, the path integral is gaussian. the determinant factor can
be regularized in the usual way [19], and one can show that |bi coincides with the
boundary state for a dp-brane with the u(1) gauge eld strength fij = ij on the
worldvolume. knowing that the path integration is gaussian, it is easy to conrm this
fact. indeed, one can show that the following identity holds:

0 = z [dp ]



p i()

e

i

2 r dp ip jij ir dpip i

|bi1

= [iijxj  ipi()]|bi.

(5)
therefore |bi should coincide with exp[ i
2 r dxixjij]|bip up to normalization. here
|bip denotes the boundary state for a dp-brane satisfying pi()|bip = 0. hence |bi
is equivalent to the boundary state for a dp-brane with the u(1) gauge eld strength
fij = ij on the worldvolume.

3

in the above analysis using the path integral expression eq.(4), the overall normal-
ization of the boundary state is ambiguous. actually one can prove the equivalence
including the normalization by showing that the open string theory corresponding to
the conguration eq.(1) is equivalent to the one corresponding to a dp-brane. we refer
to [20] for more details.

it is easy to supersymmetrize the above arguments.

in the nsr formalism the
boundary state for d-instanton can be written as a sum of four states |b; i1,i where
i = n s, r indicates the sector it belongs to and

xm ()|b; i1,i = 0,
(m ()  i m ())|b; i1,i = 0.

supersymmetric generalization of eq.(4) can be given for each |b; i1,i as

|b; ii = z [dp d]e

1

2 r d(ip ip j+ij)ij r d(ipip iii)|b; i1,i ,

(6)

(7)

2(m ()  i m ()). we can show following the same arguments as
where m () = 1
above that this boundary state coincides with the boundary state for a dp-brane up to
normalization. it is also possible to prove the equivalence of the open string theories
[21].

since the arguments in this section are essentially about the variables xi, i (i =
1,    , p + 1) on the worldsheet, it is quite straightforward to apply the arguments
here to prove that a dp-brane can be expressed as a conguration of innitely many
d(p2r)-branes. it is also easy to generalize the argument to the case of n dp-branes.
in such a case we should consider the block diagonal background

x i = p i  in ,

(8)

where in is the n  n identity matrix which is an element of u(n) lie algebra. the
expression of the boundary state in eq.(4) should be modied to

|bi = z [dp ]trpe

i

2 r dp ip jij ir dpip i

|bi1,

(9)

where trp here means the trace of the path-ordered product with respect to the u(n)
indices. it is easy to see that this conguration corresponds to n dp-branes following
the same arguments as above.

3 worldvolume theory

in the previous section, we explained that the open string theory corresponding to
the conguration of d-instantons in eq.(1) is equivalent to the one for a dp-brane with
f = . this means that the worldvolume theory of one dp-brane can also be described

4

as the worldvolume theory of d-instantons. in this section, we investigate the worldvol-
ume theory from two dierent points of view, i.e. either as the worldvolume theory of
one dp-brane or d-instantons. we call them dp-brane picture and d-instanton picture
respectively. we will show how these two are related with each other. the argument
in this section will be done for bosonic string case for simplicity. for superstring case,
similar results can be derived starting from the expression eq.(7).

our argument in this section can be applied to study the worldvolume theory of
dp-branes by regarding it as the worldvolume theory of innitely many d(p  2r)-
branes for 2r < p + 1. it is also straightforward to deal with the case when the number
of the dp-brane is more than one. we will comment on these generalizations at the
end of this section.

3.1 dp-brane picture

let us start from the following expression of the boundary state for the dp-brane:

|bi = z [dp ]e

i

2 r dp ip jij ir dpip i

|bi1.

(10)

this corresponds to a dp-brane longitudinal to xi (i = 1,    , p + 1) directions with the
u(1) gauge eld strength f = . the worldvolume theory of a dp-brane consists of a
gauge eld ai and scalar elds m (m = p + 2,    , d). m correspond to the shape of
the worldvolume which can be expressed by the equation xm = m (x1,    , xp+1). we
are considering here the eld congurations in the static gauge, so that the coordinates
on the worldvolume are taken to be x1,    , xp+1. the boundary state corresponding
to a conguration of ai, m is easily guessed to be

|bi = z [dp ] exp[iz dai(p )p i  iz d(pip i +

d

xm =p+2

pm m (p ))]|bi1.

(11)

indeed this coincides with eq.(10) when f = , m = 0. for small deformations
ai, m from the background f = , m = 0, we expect that the boundary state |bi
in eq.(10) is modied by the vertex operator as

(1 + iz d(ai(x)xi  m (x)pm ))z [dp ]e

i

2 r dp ip jij ir dpip i

|bi1,

(12)

which is consistent with eq.(11). moreover since xm ()|bi1 = 0, this boundary
state exactly describes the emission of a closed string from the worldvolume xm =
m (x1,    , xp+1). the contribution of the gauge eld is in the form of the wilson
loop. this state will be brs invariant for only those ai, m satisfying the equations
of motion. qb|bi = 0 implies that the path integral measure is invariant under the
reparametrization   (). imposing such a condition, one may be able to deduce
the equations of motion after calculations similar to [19].

5

thus in this picture, the worldvolume theory is a u(1) gauge theory with scalars
m . in this note, we always assume that pauli-villars regularization on the worldsheet
is taken so that the noncommutativity because of the regularization discussed in [17]
does not occur.

3.2 d-instanton picture

now let us consider the worldvolume theory as the worldvolume theory of d-instantons.
the boundary state eq.(10) corresponds to the conguration eq.(1) of d-instantons.
general conguration of d-instantons can be described as

x m = m ( p ) (m = 1,    , d),

(13)

if one assumes that the operators p i (i = 1,    , p) generate all the possible operators
acting on the chan-paton indices of d-instantons. here in dening the functions m ,
we need to specify the ordering of the operators p i, which will be given shortly. what
will be the form of the boundary state corresponding to the conguration eq.(13)? a
natural guess is

|bi = z [dp ]e

i

2 r dp ip jij ir dpm m (p )|bi1.

(14)

for small deformations m from the background eq.(1), we expect that the boundary
state in eq.(10) is modied as

z [dp ](1  iz dm (p )pm )e

i

2 r dp ip jij ir dpip i

|bi1.

(15)

since the vertex operators corresponding to the transverse deformations m (m =
p + 2,    , d) coincides with those in eq.(12), we expect that the transverse m appear
in the same way as in eq.(11). eq.(14) is unique choice satisfying this condition and
the d-dimensional rotational invariance. the boundary state eq.(14) describes the
emission of a closed string from the hypersurface x m = m (p ). therefore the elds
m (p ) correspond to the shape of the d-branes and p i play the role of the coordinates
of the p-brane.

in order to be consistent with the path integral form eq.(14), the ordering in eq.(13)
should be chosen to be weyl-ordering[22]. to be more explicit, for each c-number
function f (p ), let us dene the weyl-ordered function f ( p ) to be

where

f ( p ) = z dp+1keiki p i f (k),

f(k) = z dp+1p

(2)p+1

eikip i

f (p ).

6

(16)

(17)

then m ( p ) on the right hand side of eq.(13) should be understood to be the weyl-
ordered function corresponding to the c-number function m (p ) in eq.(14).

the action and other physical quantities in the worldvolume theory of d-instantons
are written as a trace of a function of the weyl-ordered operators in eq.(16). however
it is more convenient for us to rewrite everything in terms of the c-number functions
m (p ) in eq.(17). we can do so by using the following formula[23]:

t r(f1( p )f2( p )    fn( p )) = z

dp+1p

(2)(p+1)/2q|det|

here the -product is dened as

f1(p )  f2(p )    fn(p ).

(18)

f (p )  g(p ) = e

i
2 ij 
i



j f (p + )g(p + )|==0.

(19)

hence, a trace of a function of weyl-ordered operators can be rewritten in terms of
the corresponding c-number functions by replacing product of operators by -product
of the corresponding c-number functions and trace by integral.

thus if one regards the worldvolume theory as a theory of d-instantons, the de-
scription should be noncommutative. p i can be considered as the coordinates on the
p-brane and they are noncommutative under the -product reecting the commuta-
tion relation eq.(2). now let us discuss what kind of theory this noncommutative eld
theory is. the lagrangian of the worldvolume theory of d-instantons can be written
in terms of the commutators of the matrices m ( p ). since we started from the back-
ground in eq.(1), let us express i (i = 1,    , p + 1) in the form of the background and
the uctuations around it:

(20)
the c-number expression corresponding to the commutators of i( p ) are easily calcu-
lated to be

i( p ) = p i + ijaj( p ).

[i( p ), j( p )]  iij  i(f )ij,

(21)

(22)

where

fij = iaj(p )  jai(p )  iai  aj(p ) + iaj  ai(p ).

fij can be considered as the eld strength of a noncommutative yang-mills eld ai.
i( p ) essentially corresponds to the covariant derivative  + ia. thus the commutators
of i with other elds give the covariant derivative of these elds. other commutators
are interpreted as the gauge covariant commutators in the noncommutative yang-
mills theory. since the lagrangian is written in terms of these commutators, the
noncommutative theory we have here can be considered as noncommutative yang-mills
theory [24]. the gauge invariance of the theory stems from the transformation

m ( p ) = i[, m ( p )].

(23)

7

as a theory of d-instantons this is the u() transformation under which the theory
should is invariant. in the c-number formulation such a transformation is the coordinate
transformation

p = ijj(p ).

(24)

this is the coordinate transformation which preserves  = 1.
if one regards 
as a symplectic form, such transformations are the canonical transformations. the
invariance under the canonical transformation will be discussed in the next subsection.

3.3 relation between the two pictures

in the previous subsections we obtain two points of view about the worldvolume theory.
since they are supposed to describe the same thing, there should be correspondence
between the two. in the dp-brane picture, the worldvolume elds are the gauge eld
ai (i = 1,    , p + 1) and scalars m (m = p + 2,    , d), where the coordinates on the
worldvolume is taken to be xi (i = 1,    , p + 1). on the other hand, the worldvolume
elds in the d-instanton picture are m (p ) (m = 1,    , d) and p i are the coordinates
on the worldvolume.

as we noticed in the previous section, the elds m (m = p + 2,    , d) common to
both correspond to each other. therefore we should nd how the elds ai and i are
related. let us rst consider small deformations ai, i from the background eq.(1).
from eq.(12), one can see that ai changes the boundary state as

|bi = iz [dp ]z dai(p )p ie

i

2 r dp ip jij ir dpip i

|bi1,

which should be compared with the variation corresponding to i from eq.(15):

|bi = iz [dp ]z di(p )pie

i

2 r dp ip jij ir dpip i

|bi1.

(25)

(26)

the relation between these two variations can be derived from the following identity

0 = z [dp ]



p i()

e

i

2 r dp ip j ij ir dpip i

|bi1

= z [dp ][iijp j  ipi]e

i

2 r dp ip jij ir dpip i

|bi1,

(27)

which implies that |bi in eqs.(25)(26) coincide with each other when ai = ijj.
such a relation was given in [25].

in order to see the relation between the two pictures for nite deformations, the most
convenient way is to consider a description involving elds ai and m (m = 1,    , d).
from eqs.(11)(14), the boundary state involving all these elds should be

|bi = z [dp ]eir dai(p )p iir dpm m (p )|bi1.

(28)

8

however there are two many elds in such a description and there should be symmetry
to reduce the number of them. the boundary state eq.(28) is invariant under gauge
transformation ai = i. moreover, in the dp-brane picture, considering ai and
m just means considering the theory before the gauge xing of reparametrization
invariance. therefore the theory should have reparametrization invariance.

indeed we can argue that the boundary state eq.(28) is invariant under the following

transformation

ai(p ) = j(p )fji(p ),
m (p ) = i(p )im (p ),

(29)

because the variation is proportional to a sum of the equations of motion for p i.
this transformation coincides with the coordinate transformation up to eld-dependent
gauge transformation because

ai(p ) = j jai  ijaj + i(jaj).

(30)

since the boundary state eq.(28) is gauge invariant, it is reparametrization invariant.
therefore the description involving ai and m (m = 1,    , d) is invariant under
the reparametrization on the worldvolume. the dp-brane picture obviously corre-
sponds to the static gauge. on the other hand, one can see from eq.(14) that the
d-instanton picture apparently corresponds to the gauge fij = ij. we are not sure if
such a gauge can be taken for arbitrary conguration of the gauge eld f , but at least
when we are thinking about the uctuation from the background f =  perturbatively,
it seems all right. such a gauge does not x the whole reparametrization invariance
on the worldvolume. the residual invariance consists of the coordinate transformation
preserving ij, i.e. the canonical transformation. we saw such an invariance as the
c-number counterpart of the u() invariance in the previous subsection.

since the dierence is from the gauge choice, we can give the explicit relation
st (x) (m = p + 2,    , d) and the variables

between the static gauge variables ai(x), m
m
nc(p ) (m = 1,    , d) 3 in the noncommutative description at least classically:

m
nc(p ) = m

st (1

ij = fkl(1

nc(p ),    , p+1

nc (p ))

k
nc
p i

l
nc
p j

.

(31)

(32)

eq.(32) can be rewritten in terms of the noncommutative yang-mills eld ai using
eq.(20) as

where

(1)ij = (m t f (p + a)m)ij ,

m i

j = i

j + ikjak(p ).

(33)

(34)

3here the subscript st and nc are for distinguishing m in dierent gauges.

9

this gives an explicit relation between commutative gauge eld ai(x) and noncommu-
tative gauge eld ai(p ).

now let us comment on two generalizations of our results in this section. first one
is to consider more than one dp-branes. starting from the background eq.(8), we can
follow the arguments of n = 1 case. this time all the elds ai and m are in the
adjoint representation of u(n). we should put trp in front of the right hand sides
of eqs.(10),(11),(14),(28) and then we can follow the same arguments as n = 1 case.
the reparametrization invariance of the boundary state in this case can be derived
as follows. the path-ordered trace version of eq.(28) can be rewritten by introducing
fermions  in the fundamental representation u(n) as

|bi = z [dp d] exp[z diz daa

i (p )p itaiz dpm m,a(p )ta]|bi1.
(35)
here ta are the generators of u(n) in the fundamental representation. in this form,
we can see that the boundary state is invariant under the transformation

ai(p ) = j(p )fji(p ),
m (p ) = i(p )dim (p ),

(36)

because the variation is proportional to the equations of motion for p i, . this trans-
formation is again equivalent to the coordinate transformation up to eld-dependent
gauge transformation. moreover we can argue that the boundary state is invariant
under

ai(p ) = j(p )tafji(p ),
m (p ) = i(p )taim (p ),

(37)

because the variation is proportional to lim ta()  (equations of motion)().
this transformation can be considered to be a nonabelian generalization of coordinate
transformation up to eld-dependent gauge transformation. fixing such invariance by
taking static gauge or f =  and we get commutative or noncommutative descriptions
respectively.

secondly it is also possible to study the worldvolume theory of dp-branes regarding
it as the worldvolume theory of innitely many d(p  2r)-branes. we obtain a descrip-
tion in which some of the coordinates on the worldvolume become noncommutative.

4 discussions

in this note, we have shown that dp-branes with constant eld strength fij can be
represented as a conguration of innitely many d(p  2r)-branes. the worldvolume
theory of the dp-branes can be analysed by regarding it as the worldvolume theory of
the d(p  2r)-branes and we obtain a noncommutative description of the worldvolume

10

theory. the system we studied here is gauge equivalent to the one studied in [17]. in
that paper, d-branes in constant bij background was considered and the authors get
commutative and noncommutative descriptions of the worldvolume theory depending
on the regularization. moreover they propose descriptions with continuously varying
 which connect the commutative and noncommutative descriptions. actually we can
realize such descriptions also in our formalism by considering our system in constant
bij background [26]. therefore we suspect that our noncommutative description is
equivalent to a choice of  in [17]. since we have an explicit relation between the
commutative and noncommutative descriptions, it may be interesting to compare our
relation and theirs. here we just comment on one crucial dierence.
in [17], the
gauge transformations of the commutative and noncommutative descriptions are re-
lated but in the relation we obtained the gauge invariance of noncommutative theory
is the residual reparametrization invariance which is not related to the commutative
gauge invariance. therefore the relation we obtained in eq.(32) is for gauge invariant
quantities.

since we have an example in which there is a relation between commutative and
noncommutative theory, it may be generalized and be used in studying other non-
commutative theories. one example is the noncommutative geometric formulation of
open string eld theory[27]. we think that the relation we studied in this note may
be relevant in revealing symmetries hidden in the string eld theory. we hope that we
can come back to this problem in the future.
