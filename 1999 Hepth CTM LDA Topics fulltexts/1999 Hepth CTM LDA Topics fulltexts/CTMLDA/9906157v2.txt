abstract

the davey-stewartson 1(ds1) system[9] is an integrable model in two dimensions. a quan-
tum ds1 system with 2 colour-components in two dimensions has been formulated. this two-
dimensional problem has been reduced to two one-dimensional many-body problems with 2
colour-components. the solutions of the two-dimensional problem under consideration has been
constructed from the resulting problems in one dimensions. for latters with the -function in-
teractions and being solved by the bethe ansatz, we introduce symmetrical and antisymmetrical
young operators of the permutation group and obtain the exact solutions for the quantum ds1
system. the application of the solusions is discussed.

1, introduction :

the davey-stewartson 1 (ds1) system is an integrable model in space of two spatial and

one temporal dimensions ((2+1)d). the quantized ds1 system with scalar elds (1 component

or shortly 1c) can be formulated in terms of the hamiltonian of quantum many-body problem

in two dimensions, and some of them can be solved exactly[1][2]. particularly, it has been shown

in ref.[2] that these 2d quantum n -body system with 1c-elds can be reduced to the solvable

one-dimensional (1d) quantum n -body systems with 1c-elds and with two-body potentials[3].

thus through solving 1d quantum n -body problems with 1c-elds we can get the solutions for 2d

quantum n -body problems with 1c-elds. here the key step is to separate the spatial variables of

2d quantum n -body problems with 1c-elds by constructing an ansatz[1][2]

(1,    , n , 1,    , n ) = yi<j

(1 

c
4

(ij)(ij))x(1,    , n )y (1,    , n )

where ij = ij and ij = ij. this ansatz will be called the n-body variable-separation ansatz.

it is well known that the variable-separation methods are widely used in solving high-dimensional

one-particle problems. for instance, for geting the wave functions of electron in hydrgen atom,

the ansatz (r, , ) = r(r)p ()() is used to reduce the 3d problem to 1ds (this ansatz is

what we call the 1-body variable-separation ansatz). the n-body variable-separation ansatz can

be thought of as the extension of 1-body variable-separation ansatz. since the n-body problems

are much more complicated than the 1-body problems, it will be highlly nontrivial to construct a

n-body variable-separation ansatz. ref.[1] provided the rst example for it and showed that the

idea of variable- separating works indeed for the n-body problems induced from the ds1 system .

in this paper, we intend to generalize the above idea to multicomponents ds1 system, namely

2

to construct a new n-body variable-separation ansatz for the multicomponents case and to solve a

specic model of 2d quantum ds1 system with multicomponents.

1d n-body model with 2-components has been investigated for long time[4][5]. the most

famous one is the model with delta-function interaction between 2c-fermions[4]. it was solved by

the bethe ansatz[6] and leads to the yang-baxter equation and its thermodynamics studies[7][8]

because of the completeness of the bethe ansatz solutions.

in this paper, for deniteness, we

shall study specic 2d quantum n -body system with 2c-elds associated with the ds1 system.

this quantum n -body problem under consideration can be reduced to two 1d quantum n -body

problems with 2c-elds of ref.[4] and then be exactly solved by using an appropriate n-body

variable-separation ansatz and the bethe ansatz.

2, quantum ds1 system with two components in 2-dimension :

following usual ds1 equation[1][9], the equation for the ds1 system with two components

reads

i q = 

1
2

(2

x + 2

y )q + ia1q + ia2q,

where q has two colour components,

q =   q1

q2 ! ,

and

(x  y)a1 = ic(x + y)(qq)

(x + y)a2 = ic(x  y)(qq)

3

(1)

(2)

where notation  means the hermitian transposition, and c is the coupling constant. introducing

the coordinates  = x + y,  = x  y, we have

a1 = ic1

 (qq)  iu1()

a2 = ic1

 (qq) + iu2()

where

1
 (qq) =

1
2

(z 



d z 



d)q(, , t)q(, , t),

and u1 and u2 are constants of integration. according to ref.[2], we choose them as

u1() =

u2() =

1

2z ddu1(  )q(, , t)q(, , t)
2z ddu2(  )q(, , t)q(, , t).

1

thus eq.(1) can be written as

i q = (2

 + 2

 )q + c[1

 (qq) + 1

 (qq)]q
2 z dd[u1(  ) + +u2(  )](qq)q,

1

+

where q = q(, , t). we quantize the system with the canonical commutation relations

[qa(, , t), q

b (, , t)] = 2ab(  )(  ),

[qa(, , t), qb(, , t)] = 0.

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

where a, b = 1 or 2, [, ]+ and [, ] are anticommutator and commutator respectively. then eq.(8)

can be written in the form

q = i[h, q]

(11)

4

where h is the hamiltonian of the system

h =

1

2 z dd (  q(2

c
2

 )q +

 + 2

q[(1

 )(qq)]q
4z ddq[u1(  ) + u2(  )](qq)q ) .

the n -particle eigenvalue problem is

h | i = e | i

where

| i = z d1d1 . . . dn dn xa1...an

a1...an (11 . . . n n )q

a1 (11) . . . q

an (n n ) | 0i.

(12)

(13)

(14)

the n -particle wave function a1...an is dened by eq.(14), which satises the n -body schrodinger

equation

xi

(2

i + 2

i)a1...an + cxi<j

[(ij)(ij) + (ij)(ij)]a1...an

[u1(ij) + u2(ij)]a1...an = ea1...an

(15)

+xi<j

where ij = i  j, (ij) = i(ij ), and (ij) = 1 for ij > 0, 0 for ij = 0, 1 for ij < 0. since

there are products of distributions in eq.(15), an appropriate regularezation for avoiding uncertainty

is necessary. this issue has been discussed in ref.[10].

3, variable separation of quantum ds1 with two components and bethe ansatz

:

our purpose is to solve the n -body schrodinger equation (15). the results in ref.[2] remind

us that we can make the following ansatz

a1...an =

xa

. . . a

where m and n are matrices being independent of  and , and both xa1...an (1 . . . n ) and

yb1...bn (1 . . . n ) are one-dimensional wave functions of n-bodies. substituting eq.(16) into eq.(15),

we abtian

ixa1...an +xi<j
iyb1...bn +xi<j

u1(ij)xa1...an = e1xa1...an

u2(ij)yb1...bn = e2yb1...bn

(17)

(18)

where u1(ij) and u2(ij) are two-body potentials, eqs.

(17) (18) are one-dimensional n -body

schrodinger equations and e1 + e2 = e. above derivation indicates that the two-dimensional

n -body schrodinger equation (15) has been reduced into two one-dimentional n -body schrodinger

equations. namely, the variables in the two-dimentional n -body wave function a1...an have been

separated.

at this stage m and n are unknown temporarily. it is expected that for any given pair

of exactly solvable 1d n-body problems and the correspondent solutions, we could construct the

solutions a1...an for 2d n-body problems eq.(15) through constructing an appropriate m  n -

matrix. it has been known that the 1d n-body problem in the form of (17) or (18) can be solved

exactly for a class of potentials[4][5][11]. to illustrate the construction of m  n -matrix, we take

both potentials in (17) and (18) the delta functions u1(ij) = 2g(ij ) and u2(ij) = 2g(ij )

(g > 0, the coupling constant). then eqs.(17) and (18) become

2

ixa1...an + 2gxi<j
iyb1...bn + 2gxi<j

2

(ij )xa1...an = e1xa1...an

(ij )yb1...bn = e2yb1...bn .

(19)

(20)

as x and y are wave functions of fermions with two components, denoted by x f and y f , the

problem has been solved by yang long ago[4] (more explicitly, see ref.[12] and ref.[13]). according

6

to the bethe ansatz, the continual solution of eq.(9) in the region of 0 < q1 < q2 < . . . < qn < l

reads

x f = xp

(q)
p exp{i[kp1 q1 + . . . + kpn qn ]}

= (q)

12...n ei(k1q1 +k2q2 +...+kn qn ) + (q)

21...n ei(k2q1 +k1q2 +...+kn qn )

+(n !  2) others terms

(21)

where x f  {x f

a1...an }, p = [p1, p2,    , pn ] and q = [q1, q2,    , qn ] are two permutations of

the integers 1, 2, . . . , n , and

(q)
...ij... = y lm

ji =

i(kj  ki)p lm + g

i(kj  ki)  g

the eigenvalue is given by

e1 = k2

where {ki} are determined by the bethe ansatz equations,

eikj l =

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

with  = 1, . . . , m, j = 1, . . . , n. through exactly same procedures we can get the solution y f and

e2 to eq.(20).

as x and y are bosons wave-functions, denoted by x b and y b, it is easy to be shown that

x b = xp

exp{i[kp1 q1 + . . . + kpn qn ]}

(q)
...ij... = z lm

and the bethe ansatz equations are as following[13]

y b is same as x b. it is well known that x f and y f (x b and y b) are antisymmetrical (symme-

trecal) as the coordinates and the colour-indeces of the particles interchanges each other simulta-

neously, instead of the coordinates interchanges each other merely.

4, young operator of permutation group :

for permutation group sn : {ei, i = 1,    , n !}, the totally symmetrical young operator is

on =

ei,

n !

xi=1

and the totally antisymmetrical young operator is

an =

n !

xi=1

(1)piei.

the young diagram for on is 1

   n , and for an , it is

have

o3 = 1 + p 12 + p 13 + p 23 + p 12p 23 + p 23p 12.

a3 = 1  p 12  p 13  p 23 + p 12p 23 + p 23p 12.

. to s3, for example, we

(34)

(35)

lemma 1: (on xf )(1, 2,    , n ) is antisymmetrical with respect to the coordinates interchanges

of (i  j).

proof: from the denition of on (eq.(32)), we have

on p ab = p abon = on .

(36)

to n = 3 case, for example, the direct calculations show o3p 12 = p 12o = o3, o3p 23 = p 23o =

o3 and so on. using eqs.(36) and (23), we have

on y lm

ij = (1)on .

from eqs.(21) and (23), x f can be written as

x f = {ei(k1q1 +k2q2 +...+kn qn ) + y 12

12 ei(k2q1 +k1q2 +...+kn qn )

(37)

(38)

using eqs.(37) and (38), we obtain

(on x f )(1,    , n ) = {ei(k1q1 +k2q2 +...+kn qn )  ei(k2q1 +k1q2 +...+kn qn )

+ei(k2q1 +k3q2 +k1q3 +...+kn qn ) + (n !  3) other terms }on (q)

12...n

(1)p exp{i[kp1 q1 + . . . + kpn qn ]}(on (q)

12...n ).

(39)

= xp

therefore we conclude that (on x f )(1,    , n ) is antisymmetrical with respect to (i  j).

lemma 2: (an x b)(1, 2,    , n ) is antisymmetrical with respect to the coordinates interchanges

of (i  j).

proof: noting (see eqs.(33) (29) (27))

an p ab = p aba = an ,

an z lm

ij = (1)an ,

9

(40)

(41)

we then have

(an x b)(1,    , n ) = xp

then the lemma is proved.

(1)p exp{i[kp1q1 + . . . + kpn qn ]}(an (q)

12...n ).

(42)

5, the solutions of the problem :

the ansatz of eq.(16) can be compactly written as

(1 

 = yi<j

c
4

(ij)(ij ))(mx)(n y )

(43)

where (mx) and (n y ) are required to be antisymmetrical under the interchanges of the coodinate

vairables. according to lemmas 1 and 2, we see that

m, n = ( on

an

for 1d fermion
for 1d boson.

(44)

as the ds1 elds qa() in eq.(1) are (2+1)d bose elds, the commutators ([, ], see (9) and

(10)) are used to quantized the system and the 2d n-body wave functions denoted in b must be

symmetrical under the colour-interchang (ai  aj) and the coordinate-interchange ((ii) 

(ji)). namly, the 2d bose wave functions b must satisfy that

p aiaj b |iij j = b.

(45)

as qa are (2+1)d fermi elds, the anticommutators should be used, and f must be antisymmet-

rical under (ai  aj) and ((ii)  (ji)). namly,

p aiaj f |iij j = f .

(46)

10

thus for the 2d boson case, two solutions of b can be constructed as following

(1 

c
4

(ij)(ij))[on x f (1    n )][on y f (1    n )],

(1 

c
4

(ij)(ij))[an x b(1    n )][an y b(1    n )].

b

1 = yi<j
2 = yi<j

b

(47)

(48)

using eqs.(36),(39),(40) and (42), we can check eq.(45) diractly. in addition, from the bethe ansatz

equations (25) (26) (30) (31) and e = e1 + e2, we can see that the eigenvalues of b

1 and b

2 are

dierent each other generally, i.e., the states corrosponding to b

1 and b

2 are non-degenerate.

for the 2d fermion case, the desired results are

(1 

c
4

(ij)(ij))[on x f (1    n )][an y b(1    n )],

(1 

c
4

(ij)(ij))[an x b(1    n )][on y f (1    n )].

f

1 = yi<j
2 = yi<j

f

(49)

(50)

eq.(46) can also be checked diractly. the eigenvalues corresponding to f are also determined by

the bethe equations and e = e1 + e2.

it is similar to ref.[2] that we can prove b

1,2 and f

1,2 shown in above are of the exact

solutions of the eq.(15). thus we conclude that the 2d quantum many-body problem induced from

the quantum ds1 system with 2-component has been solved exactly.

6, the ground-state energies of the system :

in this section, we discuss the ground-state energies of the ds1 system solved in the previous

section by using the bethe ansatz equations (25), (26) and (30), (31). let the 2d n-body problem

reduced from 2d ds1 system with 2 colour (or spin) components has m colours down and n  m

colours up. therefore both x f,b(1, 2,    n ) and y f,b(1, 2,    n ) in eqs(47)-(50) are one

dimensional n body wave functions with m colours down and n m colours up. we are interested

11

in the limit that n , m and the length l of the box go to innity proportionately, i.e., both n/l = d

and m/l = dm are nite.

for one dimensional n -fermion problem, by the nested bethe ansatz (or bethe-yang ansatz)

equations (25) and (26), the corresponding integration equations for the ground state read[4]

21 = z b1
21 = 1 +z b1

b1

b1

2g1()d

g2 + (  )2 +z q1
4g1()d
g2 + 4(k  )2 ,

q1

4g1(k)dk

g2 + 4(k  )2 ,

(51)

(52)

where 1(k) is particle (i.e.,1d fermion) density distribution function of k, and 1() is colour-down

particle density distribution function of . namely, we have

d = z q1

q1

1(k)dk, dm = z b1

b1

1()d, e1/n = d1z q1

q1

k21(k)dk.

(53)

for 1d n-boson case, starting from the nested bethe ansatz equations (30) and (31), similar

integration equations for ground state of bosons can be derived (see appendix). the results are as

follows

22 = z b2
22 = 1 z b2

b2

b2

4g2(k)dk

g2 + 4(k  )2 ,
2g2(k)dk
g2 + (k  k)2 ,

2g2()d

g2 + (  )2 z q2

q2

4g2()d

g2 + 4(  k)2 +z q2

q2

(54)

(55)

where 2(k) and 2() are bosonic particle density distribution function of k and its colour-down

particle density distribution function of  respectively, i.e.,

d = z q2

q2

2(k)dk, dm = z b2

b2

2()d, e2/n = d1z q2

q2

k22(k)dk.

(56)

the everage energies of the 2d ds1 ground states described by b

1 , b

2 , f

1 and f

2 (see

eqs(47)(50)) are denoted by e(b

1 ), e(b

2 ), e(f

1 ) and e(f

2 ) respectively. then, the everage

12

energies per particle for the ground-states are follows

e(b

e(b

1 )/n = 2e1/n = 2d1z q1
2 )/n = 2e2/n = 2d1z q2

q1

q2

k21(k)dk,

k22(k)dk,

e(f

(e1 + e2)

k21(k)dk +z q2

q2

k22(k)dk)

=

2

(e(b

1 ) + e(b

2 )),

e(f

2 )/n = e(f

1 )/n.

(57)

(58)

(59)

(60)

from these equations, the follows can been seen: 1, the everage energies per particle for the ground

states of this 2-dimensional (2d-) ds1 problem are reduced into the everage energies per particle

of 1-dimensional (1d-)many body problems. as d and dm are given, by solving the integration

equations (51)  (56), we obtain the 1(k) and 2(k), and then get the desired results of e(b

1 )/n ,

e(b

2 )/n , e(f

1 )/n and e(f

2 )/n . 2, for the two bosonic solutions of the 2d ds1 system

with 2 colours (eqs (47) (48)), the everage ground state energies per particle are twice as large as

one of 1d-fermions or 1d-bosons; 3, for the fermion solutions of this 2d-ds1 system, e(f

1 )/n

and e(f

2 )/n are sum of 1d-fermion everage energy per particle and 1d-bosons. 4, in general,

e(b

1 ) 6= e(b

2 ) 6= e(f

1, or 2). namely, for same ds1 system, if the statistics of the wave functions

(or particles) is dierent, the corresponding ground-state energies are dierent. this is remarkable

and reects the statistical eects in the 2d ds1 system.

7, discussions and summary :

finally, we would like to speculate some further applications of the results presented in this

13

paper to the mathematical physics. our results may be useful in the following two respects. firstly,

the bethe ansatz equations (25), (26) for fermion wave functions and (30), (31) for bosons can be

solved respectively, even though the equations are systems of transcendental equations for which the

roots are not easy to locate. the so-called string hypothesis is used for the analysis and classication

of the roots for the bethe ansatz equations[7][8]. thus, we could study thier ground state, the

excitation and the thermodynamics based on it[7][8]. then, the thermodynamical properties of

the 1d bose or fermi gas with function interaction and with two components can be explored.

the eqs.(47)(50) indicate that under the thermodynamical limit the 2d ds1 gases (with two

colour components) are classied into 2d bose gases and 2d fermi gases. by eqs (47) (48), the 2d

bose gases are composeted of two 1d fermi gases or 1d bose gases, and by eqs (49) (50), the 2d

fermi gases are composeted of 1d fermi gas and 1d bose gas. hence, the thermodynamics of 2d

ds1 gases with two colour components can be derived exactly. it would be interesting in physics,

because this is an interesting and nontrivial example to illustrate coupling (or fusing) of two 1d

2-component gases with function interactin and with dierent or same statistics. secondly, the

colourless ds1 equation originated in studies of nonlinear phenomena[9]. five years ago, pang,

pu and zhao[14] showed an example that the solutions of the initial-boundary-value problem for

the related classical ds1 equation in ref.[15] are consistent with the solutions for the quantum

ds1 system with time-dependent applied forces. this indicates that the classical solutions of ds1

equation are corresponding to the classcal limit of the solutions for the quantum ds1 system. this

is actully a new method to reveal the solutions of the colourless ds1 equation. to the quantum ds1

system with colour indices studied in this present paper, similar correspondences are expectable.

14

hence, the structure of the solutions of the quantum ds1-system with colour indices revealed in

this paper would be helpful to understand the corresponding classical solutions of ds1 systems

with colour. the specic studies on the above speculations would be meaningful, however, they

are beyond the scope of this present paper.

to summarize. we formulated the quantum multicomponent ds1 system in terms of the

quantum multicomponent many-body hamiltonain in 2d space. then we reduced this 2d hamil-

tonain to two 1d multicomponent many-body problems. as the potential between two particles

with two components in one dimension is function, the bethe ansatz was used to solve these

1d problems. by using the ansatz of ref.[1] and introducing some useful young operators, we pre-

sented a new n-body variable-separation ansatz for fusing two 1d-solutions to construct 2d wave

functions of the quantum many-body problem which is induced from the quantum 2-component

ds1 system. there are two types of wave functions: bosons and fermions. both of them satisfy

the 2d many-body schrodinger equation of the ds1 system exactly. the results have been used to

study the ground states of the system. some further applications of the results presented in this

paper are speculated and discussed.

appendix

let us derive eqs (54) and (55) in the text. we start from the bethe ansatz equations (30) and

(31) of 1d bosons with two colour componts. taking the logarithm of (30) and (31) respectively,

we have

n

kjl = 2ik  2

xi=1
tan1   

g

m

x=1

tan1 kj  ki

g

= 2j + 2

n

xj=1

m

tan1 2(  kj)

x=1
tan1 2(  kj)

g

where (for the case of n =even, m =odd)

+ ik = successive integers from 1 

j = successive integers from 

1

n to +

(m  1) to +

(m  1).

we can now approach the limit n  , m  , l   proportionally, obtaining

k = 2f2  2z q2
2z b2

which are just eqs (54) and (55).
