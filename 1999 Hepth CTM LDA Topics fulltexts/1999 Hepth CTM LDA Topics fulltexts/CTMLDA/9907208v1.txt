derivative expansion and soliton masses

department of physics, university of connecticut, storrs ct 06269, usa

gerald v. dunne

we present a simple algorithm to implement the generalized derivative expansion introduced
previously by l-h. chan, and apply it to the calculation of the one-loop mass correction to the
classical soliton mass in the 1+1 dimensional jacobi model. we then show how this derivative
expansion approach implies that the total (bosonic plus fermionic) mass correction in an n=1
supersymmetric soliton model is determined solely by the asymptotic values (and derivatives) of
the fermionic background potential. for a static soliton the total mass correction is m/(2), in
agreement with recent analyses using phase-shift methods.

the calculation of quantum corrections to classical soliton masses is a key ingredient in the semiclassical approach
to quantum eld theory [1,2]. this question has been re-addressed recently [3,4] for 1 + 1 dimensions using topological
boundary conditions and phase-shift methods. in this letter i compute the quantum mass correction for solitons
in the recently introduced jacobi model [5], using a simple algorithm based on the derivative expansion [6,7]; and i
apply this derivative expansion approach to the total mass correction in an n = 1 susy model in 1 + 1 dimensions.

consider the following lagrangian for a real scalar eld  in 1+1 dimensions:

the 4 and sine-gordon models are text-book cases [1], while the jacobi potential has recently been studied in the
context of an exactly solvable model of quantum mechanical instantons [5]. since quantum mechanical instantons
have the same functional form as solitons in 1+1 dimensions, some of the results of [5] carry over here. the function
sn(z|) is one of the jacobi elliptic functions [8], and 0    1 is the (real) elliptic parameter. this parameter 
controls the shape and period of the jacobi potential, as illustrated in figure 1. the jacobi model is a deformation
of the sine-gordon model, reducing smoothly to sine-gordon as   0 [note that sn( 
expansion in powers of h

2| = 0) = sin( 
m2 . with this understood, we can set m =  = 1 in our one-loop calculations.

as is well known [1], the mass m and coupling  may be scaled out, so that the semiclassical loop expansion is an

for the 4 and sine-gordon cases, the uctuation potentials in (7) are of the exactly solvable poschl-teller form,
which means that the quantum mass correction in (6) can be computed exactly. the uctuation potential for the

2

jacobi model is shown in figure 2; its spectral properties are not known exactly, and so we need an approximate
method to compute the mass correction (6). here we use the derivative expansion [6,7].

to implement the derivative expansion we rst note that v (c(x))  1 as x  , for the uctuation potentials
appearing in (6). moreover, this background value of 1 (equal to m2 with mass scales reinstated) is approached
exponentially fast. so it is more natural to expand in terms of the dierence

and its x derivatives. this leads to a generalized derivative expansion [7] in which (6) is rewritten and expanded as

w (x) = v (c(x))  1

where z  1/(2 + 1). in the derivative expansion approach [6,7], the expression (9) is renormalized by dropping a
divergent term that is independent of w (this cancels in taking the dierence with the w = 0 case), and a divergent
term linear in w (this corresponds to making the bosonic tadpole graph vanish, as in [3,4]). then a(z, w ] is dened
by the expansion

where the expansion coecients an[w ] are functionals of w (x), the rst few of which are [7]:

given the expansion (10) for a(z, w ], the  integrals in (9) can be performed to yield a simple formula for the soliton
mass correction:

(12)

thus, the derivative expansion computation of the soliton mass correction reduces to the calculation of the an[w ] in
(11) for the given w (x) in (8). we stress again that each of these an[w ] is a pure number [12].

the functionals an[w ] can be obtained by a direct expansion of the resolvent in (9), as in [7]. however, it is
easier computationally to note that these functionals have simple recurrence relations (these functionals also arise in
asymptotic and wkb expansions of discriminants [9,10], and in zeta function analysis [11]). in fact,

an[w ] = (1)n+1(2n + 3) z 



r2n+4(x) dx

(13)

where the functions rn(x) are dened by the following recurrence relation:

(14)

this algorithm for generating the r2n+4(x) functions is simple to implement using, for example, mathematica or
maple. furthermore, all the integrals in (13) can be performed analytically for each of the three soliton models listed
in (2).

so far, this algorithm could be applied to any suitable potential w (x) in (9), with w (x)  0 suciently quickly
as x  . if the background is that of a soliton c(x) satisfying (3), so that w (x) is given by (8), it is more
convenient to change variables in the integration in (13) from x to c, using (3). for example:

a0[w ] =

(15)

these modied expressions for an[w ] are straightforward to generate, either by converting the expressions in (11), or
by a new recurrence relation based on (14). in (15), both v and w = v   1 are treated as functions of , and the
integration is between the neighboring minima of v () between which the soliton interpolates, just as in the standard
calculation (5) of the classical mass. the advantages of this form (15) are : (i) the only input is the original potential
v (); (ii) the integrals are easier than those in (11); (iii) it organizes the expansion (12) as a derivative expansion, as
each an in (15) involves only terms with (2n + 4) derivatives of v with respect to .

the derivative expansion calculation of the soliton mass correction (12) can now be programmed as a simple
algorithm: generate the expressions in (11) or (15) using recursion relations, do the integrals, and then insert the an
into (12). we rst test this algorithm on the well-known solvable cases. for the sine-gordon model one nds asg
n = 2
for all n, conrming a result in [7]. then, using our formula (12), we immediately obtain the standard result [1,2]

(17)

one can speed up the convergence of the derivative expansion by separating out the contribution from the zero mode
of the uctuation potential [7]. this is achieved by writing a(z, w ] = (a(z, w ] + 1
2 in (9) and (10), which
separates out a  1

 term, so that the mass correction (12) becomes

(18)

in this form (18), already the leading (n = 0) derivative expansion term gives the exact answer for the sine-gordon
case. for the 4 model, the leading term gives 10% accuracy, the rst correction gives better than 2% accuracy, two

4

corrections give 0.3% accuracy, and three corrections give 0.05% accuracy. this is impressive accuracy, especially
considering a0, . . . , a3 can easily be calculated analytically.

for the jacobi model there does not appear to be a simple closed formula for the an. this is presumably a reection
of the fact that in this case, unlike in the 4 and sine-gordon cases, v (c(x)) is not an exactly solvable potential.
nevertheless, we can compute various orders an of the derivative expansion expression with ease:

on the other hand, as   1 the quantum mass correction diverges, just as does the classical jacobi soliton mass in
(5). this singular behavior is due to the fact that as   1 the period of the jacobi potential diverges logarithmically,
so neighboring vacua become innitely separated, and the asymptotic limits of the classical soliton c(x) in (4) diverge.

indistinguishable on this scale from that with the rst four terms. the solid horizontal line is the sine-gordon mass correction

the fermionic contribution to the one-loop soliton mass correction is

but with the susy coupling (23), w(x) is equal to the bosonic potential w (x):

thus the total one-loop mass correction, including both bosonic and fermionic contributions, is

(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

that is, the net mass correction is (half) the dierence of two bosonic mass corrections, for w(x) respectively.
now notice the remarkable fact that if we compute this dierence using the derivative expansion (12), then term
by term each of the functionals an[w] an[w+] obtained from (11) is an integral of a total derivative. for example,

due to this dramatic simplication, the dierences an[w] an[w+] are determined solely by the asymptotic values
(at x = ) of vf (x) and its x derivatives. but for a solitonic background, vf (c(x)) approaches 1 exponentially
fast, so

for example, these conditions are clearly satised for the 4, sine-gordon and jacobi models,

vf (c(x)) = 1 at x =

inserting the asymptotic conditions (29) into (28), the derivatives of vf do not contribute, and we discover that the

this is in agreement with recent analyses [3,4] using topological boundary conditions and phase shift methods. we
