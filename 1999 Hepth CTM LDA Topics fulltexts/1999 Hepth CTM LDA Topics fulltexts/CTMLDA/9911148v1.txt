self-gravitating su(2) higgs magnetic monopoles exist up to a critical value of the ratio of
the vector meson mass to the planck mass, which depends on the higgs boson mass. at the
critical value a critical solution with a degenerate horizon is reached. as pointed out by lue and
weinberg, there are two types of critical solutions, with a transition at an intermediate higgs
boson mass. here we investigate this transition for black holes, and reconsider it for the case of
gravitating monopoles.

i. introduction

in the su(2)-einstein-yang-mills-higgs model, gravitating magnetic monopoles and non-abelian black holes
exist in a certain region of the parameter space [13]. for a xed value of the higgs boson mass, gravitating
monopoles exist up to a critical value cr (of the parameter , which is proportional to the ratio of the vector meson
mass to the planck mass), and non-abelian black holes exist up to a critical value cr(xh) (for small enough values
of the horizon radius xh [3]). at the critical value cr a critical solution with a degenerate horizon is reached. in
particular, for small values of the higgs boson mass, the critical solution where a horizon rst appears corresponds
to an extremal reissner-nordstrm (rn) solution outside the horizon while it is non-singular inside.

recently lue and weinberg [4] reconsidered self-gravitating magnetic monopoles. in particular, they observed,
that for larger values of the higgs boson mass, the critical solution is an extremal black hole with non-abelian
hair and a mass less than the extremal rn value. exploring the transition between the two regimes, occurring at
some intermediate value of the higgs boson mass, lue and weinberg were left with a discrepancy between their
analytical and numerical results [4].

in this brief report we extend the investigation of lue and weinberg to non-abelian black holes, showing the
transition to persist in the presence of xed nite event horizon radii xh. furthermore, we reconsider the case of
gravitating monopoles, suggesting a numerical reason for the observed discrepancy of the analytical and numerical
results [4].

ii. gravitating monopoles

we consider the su(2) einstein-yang-mills-higgs action, with a higgs triplet [16]. to obtain static spherically

symmetric globally regular solutions we employ schwarzschild like coordinates [5,6]

ds2 = a2n dt2 + n 1dr2 + r2(d2 + sin2 d2) ,

(1)

and the standard wu-yang and hedgehog ansatz for the gauge and higgs elds, respectively, with vanishing time
component of the gauge eld. [14].

the equations of motion contain two physical parameters,

where g is newtons constant, v is the higgs eld expectation value, mh is the higgs boson mass and mw is the
gauge boson mass. the parameters a and b are employed by lue and weinberg [4], while  and  are employed
by breitenlohner et al. [3].

let us briey recall how the magnetic monopole solutions approach critical solutions, when the vector boson
mass, i.e. a, is varied, while the ratio of the higgs boson mass to the vector boson mass, i.e. b, is kept xed.
recently, lue and weinberg [4] realized that there are two regimes of b, each with its own type of critical
solution.

in the rst regime b is small, and the metric function n (r) of the monopole solutions possesses a single minimum.
as the critical solution is approached, i.e. as a  acr, the minimum of the function n (r) decreases until it reaches
zero at r = r0. the limiting solution corresponds to an extremal rn black hole solution with horizon radius
rh = r0 and unit magnetic charge for r  r0. consequently, also the mass of the limiting solution coincides with
the mass of this extremal rn black hole. however, the limiting solution is not singular in the interior region,
r < r0. we refer to this limiting approach as rn-type behaviour.

in the second regime b is large, and the metric function n (r) of the monopole solutions develops a second
minimum as the critical solution is approached. this second minimum arises interior to the location of the rst
minimum, and decreases faster than the rst minimum. therefore, the critical solution is reached at r = r,
where the second minimum reaches zero. the critical solution thus possesses an extremal horizon at r < r0,
and corresponds to an extremal black hole with non-abelian hair and a mass less than the extremal rn value.
consequently, we refer to this second limiting approach as na-type (non-abelian-type) behaviour.

lue and weinberg [4] investigated both analytically and numerically the transition from the rn-type of be-
haviour to the na-type of behaviour. one of their main analytical results is, that the rn-type behaviour is
possible only for a > 1.5, making atr = 1.5 the critical value, where the transition should occur. this lower bound
is found by an accurate analytical expansion of the solution about the point r = r0, where n (r) has a double
zero. (the hypotheses used are mild and, very likely, fullled by the solutions.)

with increasing b the critical value acr decreases. for small b the critical value acr is larger than the analytical
transition value atr, and the behaviour is of rn-type. as b is increased, and acr decreases towards atr = 1.5 the
behaviour remains of rn-type. but surprisingly, as atr = 1.5 is passed, lue and weinberg do not immediately
observe the transition to the na-type behaviour. (atr = 1.5 would correspond to b  25.6 [4].) instead they
continue to see numerically the rn-type behaviour up to the value acr = 1.42, corresponding to b  40, which is
clearly below their analytical prediction for the transition.
performing an independent numerical analysis, we observe that the na-type behaviour occurs indeed for lower
values of b than b = 40 and thus larger values of a than a = 1.42. numerically we nd the na-type behaviour
for b > 30. this is illustrated in figs. 1 and 2, where we present the critical value acr  1 and the ratio r/r0 as
functions of b, respectively, in the na-type regime. (these gures should be compared to figs. 10 and 8 of [4],
respectively.)

the subtle point of this analysis is illustrated in fig. 3, where we present the value of the function n (r) at the
rst minimum as a function of the value of b, where the second minimum rst appears. clearly, for 40 > b > 30,
the second minimum of the metric function n (r) appears only, when the value of the function n (r) at the rst
minimum is already very small, decreasing from a value on the order of 106 to a value on the order of 109.
obviously, with decreasing b it becomes increasingly dicult, to observe the na-type behaviour. but once the
second minimum is present, a small increase of a results in a large decrease of the value of the second minimum
of n (r), whereas the value of the rst minimum remains practically unchanged.

even though our numerical analysis is not accurate enough to nd na-type behaviour for b < 30, we expect
it to be present until atr = 1.5 is reached. linear extrapolation of the curve in fig. 1 leads to btr = 25.58, while
(a less accurate) extrapolation of the curve in fig. 3 leads to btr = 26.7 [7]. thus our numerical analysis does
not fully resolve the discrepancy of lue and weinberg [4], but it indicates, that the discrepancy is due to limited
numerical accuracy.

like gravitating monopoles, magnetically charged non-abelian black holes approach critical solutions when a is
varied, while b and the horizon radius xh are kept xed. extending the above analysis to the case of black holes,

we observe again two regimes, with na-type and rn-type behaviour, respectively. since the transition value
atr = 1.5 is obtained by performing a taylor expansion about a point far from the horizon and by making use
of the rst few terms of this expansion, we expect this result to hold also in the case of black holes.

our numerical results for black holes with horizon radius xh = 0.01 and 0.1 are included in figs. 1-3, along
with the corresponding results for the regular solutions. we observe a complete analogy of the results for regular
solutions and black holes. with increasing horizon radius xh, the transition occurs for decreasing values of b.
extrapolating the curves of fig. 1 to atr = 1.5, we nd btr  24 for xh = 0.01 and btr  15 for xh = 0.1 [8].
finally, in fig. 4 we present r/r0 as a function of the horizon radius xh for b = 12.5, b = 21.125, b = 32 and
b = 50. for b = 12.5 and b = 21.125 the monopole solutions show rn-type behaviour. this behaviour extends to
the black hole solutions for b = 12.5 up to xh  0.17 and for b = 21.125 up to xh  0.07. the precise transition
value must be extrapolated [9]. for larger values of xh na-type behaviour arises. for b = 32 and b = 50 regular
and black holes solutions show na-type behaviour. (for b = 105 and xh = 0.1 only the second minimum is left,
as compared to b  400 for the regular solutions [4].) for larger values of b and horizon radius xh > 0.3 the
analysis of black holes solutions needs special consideration [3].

iv. conclusion

for gravitating monopoles and non-abelian black holes we have studied numerically the transition between
the low and the high higgs mass regime. considering the approach of the solutions towards a limiting critical
solution, the low higgs mass regime shows rn-type behaviour, i.e. the critical solution where a horizon rst
appears corresponds to an extremal rn solution outside the horizon, while it is non-singular inside. in contrast,
the high higgs mass regime shows na-type behaviour, i.e. the critical solution is an extremal black hole with non-
abelian hair. in particular, analytical analysis suggests that rn-type behaviour should not occur for a < atr = 1.5
corresponding to b > btr  25.6 [4].

our numerical analysis indicates two main results:

 for magnetic monopoles the na-type behaviour is still present at b = 30, i.e. clearly below the numerical
value found by lue and weinberg [4]. we conjcture that the na-type behaviour persists until the analytical
transition value is reached. but our numerical accuracy is insucient to show this.

 the analogous phenomenon occurs for black holes solutions, and with increasing values of the horizon radius

xh, the transition occurs for decreasing values of b.
