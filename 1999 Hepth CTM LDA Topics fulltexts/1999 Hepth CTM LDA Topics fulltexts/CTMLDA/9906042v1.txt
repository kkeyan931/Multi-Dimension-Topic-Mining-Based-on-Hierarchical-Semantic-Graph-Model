the duality symmetric but non manifestly covariant action proposed by schwarz and sen is
canonically quantized in the coulomb gauge. the resulting theory turns out to be, nevertheless,
relativistically invariant. it is shown, afterwards, that the schwarz-sen model naturally emerges
when duality is implemented as a local symmetry of sourceless electrodynamics. this implies in the
equivalence of these theories at the quantum level.

i. introduction

the equations of motion of the four-dimensional low energy eective eld theory for the bosonic sector of the
heterotic string, are invariant under sl(2,r) duality transformations of the massless elds involved. this, so called
s-duality symmetry, is a symmetry of the equations of motion but not of the corresponding action. on the other hand,
the low energy eective eld theory action retains the target space duality symmetry (t-duality) of string theory. it
would be desirable to achieve s-duality at the level of the action in the hope of attaining results similar to those given
by the t-duality symmetry. however, it is dicult to conciliate duality symmetry and manifest lorentz covariance.
the diculty of writing a non trivial action involving only a nite-component self-dual covariant form is well known.
in fact, to construct a duality symmetric action being manifestly covariant one must introduce auxiliary elds. the
rst attempts in this direction involved an innite number of auxiliary elds [1].

duality symmetric actions being manifestly covariant and containing a nite number of auxiliary elds have also
been constructed but they are not polynomials. these actions were found by pasti, sorokin and tonin (pst) [2,3].
for the case of electrodynamics, the pst action covariantizes the action found earlier by deser and teitelboim [4]
and rediscovered by schwarz and sen [5], which is duality symmetric but not manifestly covariant. the introduction
of sources into the manifestly covariant and non-manifestly covariant versions of these duality symmetric actions has
also been achieved [6].

the present work is essentially dedicated to establish the quantum mechanical equivalence of the schwarz-sen
and maxwell theories in the case free of sources. we start by quantizing the schwarz-sen model in the coulomb
gauge. the resulting quantum theory will be shown to be, nevertheless, relativistically invariant. this is our section
ii. in section iii we begin by recalling that the maxwell action, when formulated in the coulomb gauge, remains
invariant under a set of non-local duality transformations derived by deser and teitelboim [4]. additional elds are,
afterwards, brought into the theory in order to make these transformations local. correspondingly, a new expression
for the generating functional of green functions is derived. in section iv we demonstrate that the green functions
generating functionals for the maxwell and schwarz-sen theories are rigorously identical. section v contains the
conclusions.

ii. quantization of the schwarz-sen model

the duality symmetric action proposed by schwarz-sen [5] involves two gauge potentials a,a(0    3, 1  a  2)

and reads1

where we have designated by a

produces neither secondary constraints nor determines the lagrange multipliers. on the other hand, persistence in
time of the primary constraints {a
i } does not lead to the existence of secondary constraints but determines partially
the lagrange multipliers {ua

i }. indeed, since the poisson bracket

0 + ua,ia

does not vanish, a

i = [a

i , h ]p  0 yields ua,i = ab(bb,i  ib), where a is an arbitrary scalar. thus,

to isolate the second-class constraints from (8b), we split a

namely, a

second-class constraints are

the determination of the constraint structure is over. it only remains to be mentioned that the gauge potential

aa,, when acted upon by the generator of innitesimal gauge transformations, g =r d3x (aa
the change aa,  aa, + aa, with aa,0 = [aa,0, g]p = a and aa,i = [aa,i, g]p = ia, in agreement with
eqs.(3).
we shall next quantize the theory by means of the dirac bracket quantization procedure [912]. to this end, we

start by xing the gauge through the subsidiary conditions

(12a)
(12b)
the fact that the coulomb condition and aa,0  0 are, when acting together, accessible gauge conditions is a
peculiarity of the model under analysis. we now recall that, according to the quantization procedure being used, the
equal-time commutation algebra is to be abstracted from the corresponding dirac bracket algebra, the constraint and
gauge conditions thereby translating into strong operator relations. after some calculations one nds that

a,0  aa,0  0 ,
a  iaa,i  0 .

one may wonder on whether the right hand side of (14) is aicted by ordering ambiguities. this not so, since

the main object of interest is the eld commutator at dierent space-time points. to nd it, we must rst solve

the heisenberg equations of motion deriving from (13) and (14), namely,

since id()ab
t = 0, the function a must verify 2a = 0 but is otherwise arbitrary. thus, the lagrangian
and the hamiltonian formulations lead to equivalent equations of motions only after the introduction of a regularity
requirement at spatial innity. this situation resembles that encountered in connection with the theory of the two-
dimensional (x0, x1, x = 1/2(x0  x1)) self-dual eld () proposed by floreanini and jackiw [13,14], where the
equations of motion in the lagrangian and hamiltonian formulations turn out to be, respectively, 1 = 0 and
 = 0. we also recall that in order to solve  = 0 one starts by realizing that  = 0 = + = 0 =
 = 0. the solutions of  = 0 are then contained in the eld of solutions of  = 0. we shall follow here a
similar approach, since

hence, the quantized schwarz-sen model is a physically sensible quantum eld theory. our next task is to demon-
strate that this theory is also relativistically invariant. we are therefore looking for a set of composite operators
{} which may serve as poincare densities. we shall build them by following the rules that are used to construct
the symmetric (belinfante) energy-momentum tensor in a manifestly lorentz invariant theory. in this way we nd

thus,  is symmetric and free of ordering ambiguities but we can not yet decide on whether or not it is a tensor.
as for the equal-time commutator algebra obeyed by the components of , it is fully determined by the commutator
(15). in particular, one can corroborate that

(cid:2) 00(x0, ~x) , 00(x0, ~y)(cid:3)
=  i (cid:8) 0k(x0, ~x) + 0k(x0, ~y)(cid:9) x
(cid:2) 00(x0, ~x) , 0k(x0, ~y)(cid:3)

(29b)

(29c)

as known [15], positivity requires that a singular schwinger term, proportional to (3)(~x  ~y), must also be present
in the right hand side of eq.(29b). the denition of  can, in fact, be altered as to yield such term. but, since

5

schwinger terms do not contribute to the algebra of integrated charges, we have omitted them in eqs.(29). from
eqs.(29) then follows that the charges

p   z d3x 0 ,
j   z d3x(cid:0)0x  0x(cid:1) ,

obey the poincare algebra, i.e.,

[p , p ] = 0 ,
[j  , p ] = i (gp   gp ) ,
[j  , j ] = i (gj  + gj   gj   gj ) .

(30a)

(30b)

(31)
(32)
(33)

it takes just a few more steps to demonstrate that  is a tensor. indeed, the additional equal-time commutators

(cid:2) ij(x0, ~x) , 00(x0, ~y)(cid:3) and (cid:2) ij(x0, ~x) , 0k(x0, ~y)(cid:3) can also be readily evaluated by using (28) and (15). these

results and (29) can be collected into

(cid:2)p  , (cid:3) = i  ,
(cid:2)j  , (cid:3) = i (x   x) 
i(cid:0)g + g  g  g(cid:1) ,

which are, respectively, the translation and rotation transformation laws to be obeyed by a second-rank tensor. the
purported proof of relativistic invariance of the quantized schwarz-sen theory is now complete.

what remains to be done is to demonstrate that the coulomb gauge formulation of the quantized schwarz-sen
theory is in fact covariant. since translations and ordinary rotations do not destroy the coulomb gauge condition we
concentrate on lorentz boosts. by using (30), (28), (2b) and (13a) one arrives to

(34a)

(34b)

(35)

 ihj 0k , aa,i

t i = (x0 k  xk 0)aa,i

t  abklj il
2 ab

t j .

the term proportional to ab signalizes that gauge potentials corresponding to dierent values of a get mixed by lorentz
boosts. this does not occur for ordinary rotations. furthermore, the mixing term in (35) describes an operator gauge
transformation, which, as one easily veries, makes this commutator compatible with the transversality condition
iaa,i
t undergoes, besides the usual vector transformation, an
operator gauge transformation which restores the coulomb gauge in the new lorentz frame.

t = 0. hence, under lorentz boosts, the eld aa,i

as for the nothers charge associated with the so(2) symmetry (4), it is straightforward to verify that it can be

written as

q = 

1

2z d3xjik(j aa

t i)aa

t k =

1

2z d3xbakaa

t k .

(36)

observe that q is a so(2) invariant chern-simons term. thus, up to surface terms, it is gauge invariant. it is also
metric independent and so its algebraic form also holds for curved spaces. the use of (13a) enables one to verify that
q indeed generates the innitesimal so(2) rotations

[q, ab

t j(y)] = ibaaa

t j(y) .

furthermore, in terms of the creation and anhilation operators of (23) the operator q is found to read

and becomes diagonal,

q = iz d3k(a

q =z d3k(a

(40a)

(40b)

from (39) one sees that, in a generic state, q counts the number of left minus right polarized photons. it is easily
checked that q commutes with all the generators of the conformal group as should be the case for an internal symmetry
generator.

the last part of this section is dedicated to present the functional quantization of the schwarz-sen theory in the
coulomb gauge. clearly, the constraints (8a) and (12a) can be used to eliminate the phase-space variables a
0 , aa,0
from the outset. on the other hand, the constraints a  0, a  0 have vanishing poisson brackets with those in
the set {a

t i  0}. this means that the faddeev-popov determinant split as follows

which after taking into account the functional relationship

det(2) det1/2(abijkj) ,

reduces to

det1/2(abijkj) = det(ijkj) ,

det(2) det(ijkj) .

(41)

(42)

(43)

clearly, the rst factor in (41) is the determinant of the matrix whose elements are [a(~x), b(~y)]p , while the second is
the determinant of the matrix whose elements are given at (9). hence, for the model under analysis, the phase-space
generating functional of green functions ( w ) is given by

w = z [daa,i] [da

i ] [iaa,i] [ia

i ] det(2)
abijkjab,k] det(ijkj) ei sef f ,

where

iii. local duality transformations for maxwell theory

as is well known, for the free maxwell eld, in the coulomb gauge, the phase-space green functions generating

functional is given by2

w = z [dai] [di] det(2) [iai] [ii] eisef f ,

where the eective action (sef f ) reads

(46)

(47)

here, bi = ijkjak is the i-th component of the magnetic eld, while i denotes the momentum canonically
conjugate to ai. as shown in ref. [4], up to surface terms, sef f remains invariant under the non-local duality
transformations

2this section is mainly based on ref. [8].

ai  ai = ai + dai; dai =  2 ijk jk ,
i  

i = i + di; di =  ijk jak .

(48a)

(48b)

the point we would like to stress now is that these transformations can be made local by introducing the auxiliary

elds ci, and their corresponding canonical conjugate momenta pi, dened as follows

2ci = ijk jk ,
pi = ijk jak ,
ici = ipi = 0 .

in fact, from eqs.(48) and (49) one veries that

dai =  ci,
di =  pi,

dci =   ai,
dpi =   i .

(49a)

(49b)

(49c)

(50a)
(50b)

our next task consists in reformulating the maxwell theory in terms of the elds ai, i, ci and pi. to this end,

we rst recall that

(cid:16)y [
(cid:16)y [

where the following denition

2h (~  ~a)2 + (~  ~c)2i(cid:27) .

correspondingly, the coulomb gauge generating functional w of maxwell theory can be cast as

w =z [dai] [di] [iai] [ii]
 [dci] [dpi] [ici][ipi] det(2)
 [ci  2ijkjk][pi  ijkjak] eis ef f .

(51a)

(51b)

(52)

(53)

(54)

(55)

it is through this form of w that we shall make contact with the schwarz-sen model. needless to say, w in (55)
is, by construction, invariant under the set of local duality transformations (50). we learnt in this section that, by
means of an appropriate enlargement of the phase-space, one can incorporate duality as a local symmetry of sourceless
electrodynamics.

iv. equivalence of the maxwell and schwarz-sen theories

we have now at hand two duality symmetric theories. one is the schwarz-sen theory, whose phase space is spanned
i . the other one is maxwell theory, whose phase-space variables are ai, ci, i

by the variables a1,i, a2,i, 1
and pi. we shall prove, in this section, that these theories are quantum mechanically equivalent3.

i and 2

3this section is mainly based on ref. [8]

8

the initial step toward this proof consists in identifying those variables whose behavior under innitesimal duality
transformations is the same. for the coordinates, the task is easy. indeed, under innitesimal duality transformations
the schwarz-sen coordinates aa,i change as follows (see (4))

da1,i =  a2,i, da2,i =   a1,i .

therefore, if one sets

one obtains, from (50a) and (56),

a1,i = ai ,

a2,i = ci .

the situation is slightly more involved for the momenta. by combining (8b), (56) and (57) one nds

d1

i =

2

ijkjda2,k =

ijkja1,k =

on the other hand, (48b) enables one to write

therefore,


2

ijkjak =

1
2

di .

i =

i .

through a similar calculation, which uses (49.b) instead of (48.b), one arrives to

2
i =

1
2

pi .

(56)

(57)

(58)

(59)

(60)

(61)

(62)

we shall next take advantage of the identications above to rewrite the generating functional of maxwell theory in

terms of the schwarz-sen variables. this change of integration variables in (55) leads to

w =z [daa,i] [da
 [a2,i  2 2ijkj1
 ei sef f .

i ] det(2)
i  ijkja1,k]

k][2 2

(63)

we emphasize that, when written in terms of the schwarz-sen variables, the maxwell action (sef f ) becomes the
schwarz-sen action ( sef f ). however, since the integration measure in (63) does not appear to be that in (44), a few
more algebraic manipulations will be required to establish the equivalence between these theories. let lik be the
dierential operator

lik  ijkj .

then,

which, in particular, implies that

[ia2,i] a2,i = [ia2,i] lik2lkma2,m ,

on the other hand, from the eigenvalue equation

(64)

(65)

(66)

(67)

one learns that

or, equivalently,

det(cid:0)lik2lkm(cid:1) = constant ,

by going back with (66) and (69) into (63) one nds that

det1(cid:0)ijkj2(cid:1) = constant  det(cid:0)klml(cid:1) .

v. conclusions

we started in this work by canonically quantizing the schwarz-sen theory in the coulomb gauge. the resulting the-
ory turned out to be physically sensible. the lagrangian density dening the theory is not covariant but, nevertheless,
we were able of constructing a set charges verifying the poincare algebra.

later, we showed that the phase space associated with the coulomb gauge formulation of maxwell theory can be

conveniently enlarged in order to accommodate duality as a local symmetry.

by analyzing the behavior under duality transformation, we were able of identifying the phase-space variables of
the maxwell theory with those of the schwarz-sen theory. it was then possible to demonstrate that the corresponding
green functions generating functionals were the same.
