0. introduction

the study of the spectrum of coupled random matrices has received rather
little attention. to the best of our knowledge, coupled random matrices have
been studied, to some extent, by mehta in [16], [17], [11]. in this work, we ex-
plain how the integrable technology can be brought to bear to gain insight into
the nature of the distribution of the spectrum of coupled hermitean random
matrices and the equations the associated probabilities satisfy. in particular,

the two-toda lattice, its algebra of symmetries and its vertex operators will
play a prominent role in this interaction. namely, the method is to introduce
time parameters, in an articial way, and to dress up a certain matrix inte-
gral with a vertex integral operator, for which we nd virasoro-like dierential
equations; for a state of the art survey of these methods, see [20]. these meth-
ods lead to very simple nonlinear third-order partial dierential equations for
the joint statistics of the spectra of two coupled gaussian random matrices.

pending on parameters t = (t1, t2, . . .) and s = (s1, s2, . . .)  c and a coupling

for the usual lie algebra splitting ( )u, ( ) , explained in section 2. the familiar
standard toda lattice (on tridiagonal matrices) is a special reduction of the
two-toda lattice, in the same way that the korteweg-de vries equation (kdv)
is a reduction of the kadomtsev-petviashvili equation (kp).

conversely, starting from the the two-toda lattice equations (0.4), one is
led to wave functions 1 and 
2 and a representation in terms of  -functions
as in (0.1). as will be established in section 3, the functions n satisfy the
standard kp-equation in t and s separately (see the beginning of 3), but they
also satisfy another (new and useful) equation, which is third-order, relating
t- and s-derivatives, namely:

vertex operators and christoel-darboux  kernels. backlund-darboux
transformations refer to the general recipe of factorizing dierential or dif-
ference operators and ipping the factors, to form a new operator. when
we let this situation ow in time, the new wave functions (eigenfunctions)
can be expressed in terms of the old ones as wronskians (continuous or dis-
crete), and the new  -function is expressed in terms of the old ones, by
means of vertex operators. so, the latter can be viewed as generators of
backlund-darboux transformations for dierential or dierence operators at
the level of  -functions. typically, vertex operators x map  -functions into
 -functions, and their squares vanish; although  satises a highly nonlin-
ear equation, vertex operators have an additive property; that is  + x is a
 -function as well!

with the two-toda lattice, we associate four dierent vertex operators
xij(, ), for 1  i, j  2; they map innite vectors of  -functions into  -
vectors, as explained in section 5. the vertex operators x11 and x22 are basic
vertex operators for toda, and kp, as well, whereas x12 and x21 are vertex
operators, native to two-toda. in particular, we construct

x12(, ) = 1()x(s, )x(t, )(),

besides this work, the vertex operator x12 will also play a major role in our
later work on symmetric and symplectic matrix integrals. given a two-toda
lattice  -vector  = (...1, 0, 1, . . .), we have that  + x12(y, z) is another  -
vector. but more is true. we show that the kernels k12,n(y, z), dened by the
ratios (x12 )n/n, have eigenfunction expansions in terms of the eigenfunctions
, reminiscent of the christoel-darboux formula for orthogonal polynomials;
to be precise,

virasoro generators for  = 2. it follows that the vertex operators xij of the
two-toda lattice form, upon expansion, the generators of a large algebra of
symmetries, which come from the master symmetries for the pair of matrices
l = (l1, l2).

the following theorem deals with the joint distribution (11),

remark 1. since the equation above for the joint statistics is independent
of the size n, the same joint statistics for innite coupled ensembles should
presumably be given by the same partial dierential equation.

remark 2. for e = e1  e2 := (, a]  (, b], equation (0.20) takes
on the following form: upon introducing the new variables x := a + cb, y :=
ac + b, the dierential operators a1 and b1 take on the simple form a1 =
/x, b1 = /y and (0.20) becomes

remark 3. equation (0.20) also has a zero-curvature formulation, namely:

(0.21)

[a1  xn, b1  yn] = 0,

xn :=

a2b1fn

a1b1fn + c

and yn :=

.

the last section deals with coupled matrix ensembles, where the joint
statistics is given by the laguerre distribution. unlike theorem 0.5, the
laguerre case for n  n matrices lead to (inductive) dierential equations for
the matrix integral (0.19);
indeed, the equation contains a term, which is
expressible in terms of the same expression for (n  1)  (n  1) matrices.

ueno and takasaki [18] show that the two-toda deformations of , and
hence l, can ultimately all be expressed in terms of one sequence of  -functions
 (n, t, s) = n(t1, t2, . . . ; s1, s2, . . .) = det[(s1

finally the pair of matrices w = (w1, w2) satises the bilinear relation

(in the  splitting of (2.1))

or equivalently,

(w (t, s)w (t, s)1) = 0

(2.11)

w1(t, s)w1(t, s)1 = w2(t, s)w2(t, s)1,

from which one proves proposition 2.1; for details see [6]. equation (2.13)
below is established in adler-van moerbeke [4].

proposition 2.1 (bi-innite and semi-innite). the wave and adjoint
wave functions satisfy, for all m, n  z (bi -innite) and m, n  0 (semi-
innite) and t, s, t, s  c:

k.

in the semi-innite case, we reinterpret 1 as , where  is the semi-
innite shift operator. then one shows (2.11) and (2.12) are also valid. also
the semi-innite case is obtained from the innite case by setting i = 0 for
i  1 and 0 = 1. then the semi-innite wave vectors

(cid:16)1n(t, s; z)ep tizi(cid:17)n0

and

2n(t, s; z)ep sizi(cid:17)n0
(cid:16)

are vectors of polynomials of degree n = 0, 1, 2, . . . in z and z1 respectively,
as follows from (2.12); see [2]. in the semi-innite case, we must dene ln
1 and
ln

for integers n < 0; namely for n  z:

where + refers to the projection +(piz aizi) = pi0 aizi. observe that

for n  z, n  0; indeed, multiplying the vector

3. bilinear fay identities and a new identity

for two-toda  -functions

two-toda  -functions  (t, s) satisfy the kp-hierarchy in t and s sepa-

rately, of which the rst equation reads:

t1(cid:19)4
(cid:18) 

log  + 6 (cid:18) 

t1(cid:19)2

log !2

+ 3(cid:18) 

t2(cid:19)2

log   4

log  = 0.

but they also satisfy the following identity:

934

m. adler and p. van moerbeke

the proof of this theorem hinges on the bilinear identity, due to ueno-

takasaki [18] and a number of lemmas:

proposition 3.2. two-toda  -functions satisfy the following bilinear

identities:

(3.2)

iz=

n(t  [z1], s)m+1(t + [z1], s)e
= iz=0

n+1(t, s  [z])m(t, s + [z])e

m  n+1,

both, for the bi-innite (n, m  z) and the semi-innite case (n, m  z,
n, m  0).

proof. (3.2) follows at once from proposition 2.1 and the  -function rep-
7
7 s + b, combined with the denition of the hirota

resentations (2.10), whereas (3.3) follows from the shifts t 7 t  a, t

comparing the coecients of aj+1 in (3.4) and (3.5) yields

2 pj( t)n+2  n =

in particular, we have

dividing (3.8) and (3.9) leads to the second equality in (3.4). but, according
1 is given by (3.4). the similar result for lk
to (2.13), the (n, n + 1)-entry of lk
2
is given by the involution

t  s and l1  hl

2 h1.

proof of theorem 3.1. set k = 2 in the identities of proposition 3.3; then

subtracting 
t1

of identity (3.5) from 
s1

of (3.4) leads to theorem 3.1.

1 and hl2

the (n, n + 1)-entries of l2

2 h1 have the following equivalent
expressions, which will be useful in the theory of toeplitz matrices, as applied
to the distribution of the length of the longest increasing sequences of a random
permutation. the second identity, appearing in l2
1 below is an expression
purely in terms of one component n+1, at the expense of introducing a /t2-
derivative; the third identity involves /t1 and /s1 only, but at the expense
of involving nearest neighbors n and n+1.

the second to the last equation establishes the rst equation (3.10). the
second equation (3.10) is simply the dual of the rst one by ti  si.

the remaining statements in this section hold for both the bi-innite case
and the semi-innite case; we thank t. shiota for showing us how shifting
the arguments in various directions, and repeatedly, leads to many dierent

in the next lemma we show that the christoel-darboux type kernels,
formed by means of the two-toda wave function (2.10) can be expressed in
terms of vertex operator acting on the  -functions; set x := x(, ):

lemma 5.4. when 1 < || < ||2, the following holds (bi -innite case)

1,j()1,j() = (cid:0) 
pj<n 
2,j(1)2,j(1) = (cid:16)

the proof is based on summing up the expressions in lemma 5.3 and

noting that, given the inequalities above,

and

(cid:16) 
(cid:17)n

(cid:18) 

and ()n  0 when n  

and ()n  0 when n  +.

proof of theorem 5.1 and corollary 5.2. in the bi-innite case, the state-
ment of lemma 5.4 leads at once to (5.3), whereas in the semi-innite case,
summing up the expression (i) of lemma 5.3 yields a boundary term, by the
fact that 0 = 1. for (iii) the boundary term vanishes, since 1 = 0. to
prove the rst expansion of the corollary, let n   in the (1,1)-entry of (5.4),
assuming |/| < 1. setting n = 0 in the (2,2) and (1,2)-entries of (5.4) yields
the second and third relations of (5.5), after rst stripping the exponential part
from the equation.

we shall need the following matrix of matrix operators:13

from ni to nii (see footnote 13) and from (x(t, , ), x(s, , )) to (x11, x22)
(see footnote 12). for i 6= j, we prove for instance the following two identities:

for the vector elds n = x12n acting on the  -functions n, consider the

vectors f = (fn(t, s))nz, we compute using (7.2) and, in the third identity,
the relation of corollary 3.7, with n 7 n  1, t 7 t  [z1], s 7 s + [1],

involving n11 and n22, which were established in [6], can be shown in this

8. fredholm determinants of christoel-darboux kernels

the following theorem involves determinants of the kernels:

k11,n(y, z) := x<n
k12,n(y, z) := x<n



1(z)1(y),



2(z1)1(y),

k21,n(y, z) := xn
k22,n(y, z) := xn



1(z)2(y1),



2(z1)2(y1),

already mentioned in theorem 5.1:

theorem 8.1. the following holds:

(8.1)




(cid:16)det (k11,n(yi, zj))1i,jk(cid:17)nz
(cid:16)det (k12,n(yi, zj))1i,jk(cid:17)nz

=1 x21(y, z)




proof. we work out the result for the kernels k12 and k11. indeed, since,

proof. the proof follows from lemma 9.2 and an explicit computation for

the central charge.

proposition 9.4. the vertex operator, dened in (5.2),

x12(u, v) = 1x(s, v)x(t, u)(u)(v)

leads to a virasoro algebra of central charge c = 2,

m. adler and p. van moerbeke

proof. noticing that one piece of x12(t, s; u, v) is precisely x(t; u) for

 = 1, we apply proposition 9.3 for  = 1:


u

uk+1x12(t, s; u, v) = (cid:18)

the central charge c = 2 is obtained by setting  = 1 in the general formula
for c in proposition 9.3.

double integral of a vertex operator,

given the moment matrix (over e),

(10.11)

according to [2], [3], the borel decomposition of the semi-innite matrix15

m = s1

1 s2 with s1  d,0, s2  d0,

with s1 having 1s on the diagonal, and s2 having his on the diagonal, leads to
two strings (p(1)(y), p(2)(z)) of monic polynomials in one variable (dependent
on e), constructed, in terms of the character (z) = (zn)nz,n0, as follows:

(10.12)

p(1)(y) =: s1 (y),

p(2)(z) =: h(s1

2 ) (z).

we call these two sequences bi-orthogonal polynomials; in fact, according to [3]
the borel decomposition of m = s1

nality relations of the polynomials:

equations (2.3), and 1 and

1 and

moreover, according to [2], theorem 3.4, the determinant of the moment

according to theorem 9.1 , we also have [vk, (ue)n] = 0 and thus
0 = [vk, (ue)n] = vk(ue)n  (ue)nvk = vk(ue)n ;

taking the nth component, we nd (vk(ue)n )n = 0 and similarly with vk

theorem 12.1 (laguerre distibution). the joint statistics (11.2), namely
pn(e) = n(e)/n(r+), is a ratio of two functions, each satisfying the non-
linear third-order partial dierential equation19 (gn := log n(e)):

= 0 .

remark. equation (12.4) is actually an inductive set of equations with re-
gard to n, since it contains derivatives of the form n(e)/c21 and n(e)/c12.
the point is that, according to (10.24), these derivatives can be expressed in
terms of (t, s)-derivatives of the expression n1(e) in (12.5) below; to be
precise,

n(e)

c21

= pn+1( t)pn( s)1(e)  n1(e)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=s=cij=0,c11=c
ijpi( t)pj( s)n1(e)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=s=cij =0,c11=c

pi+i=n+1

j+j=n
i,i,j,j0

=

e

.

the t, s-partials of n1(e) can then be expressed again in terms the operators
ai, bi applied to n1, etc... .

this result hinges on knowing, as before, the virasoro constraints for the
(t, s) deformations of the matrix integral (12.1). unlike the gaussian case,

19in terms of the wronskian {f, g}x = xf.g  f.xg, with regard to a rst-order dierential

operator x.

which could be obtained by merely shifting the time, we invoke here a method,
due to [5], of representing the matrix integral by vertex operators acting on a
vacuum vector.

then n satises for k = 1, 2

akn = vkn and bkn = wkn.

evaluating akn, bkn, a1b1n, a2b1n along the locus l, using the
commutation relation [a2, w1]|l = c 
and (12.9), and setting dn =
c21
n(n + 2 + 1)/2, one checks

= (b1  dn) n|l

and so,

c21(cid:19) log n(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)l

.

setting these expressions into equations (11.14), we nd an equation and its
dual:

+ (2n + 2 + 1) =

(a2b1 + c

) log n

a1b1 log n

(b2a1 + c 
c12

) log n

b1a1 log n

.

finally, upon subtracting b1 of the rst from a1 of the second, one is led to:

b1

(a2b1 + c 
c21

) log n

a1b1 log n

 a1

(b2a1 + c

b1a1 log n

= 0,

ending the proof of theorem 12.1.
