(56) applying idea function appearing feynamn diagram yields gaussian integral q shifted integer n. summation n always convergent well remaining integral provided phase disappear. non-degenerate case, similar previous situation equation q = n non-trivial solution, thus implying external momenta must full xed relation (exceptional momenta). rational case, happens innitely many congurations external momenta periodicity exponential. way one recovers usual divergences feynman diagrams twisted su(n) gauge theory. indeed, splitting momenta standard momenta color indices, get divergent contributions congurations standard momenta. obviously, statements last section conjectural nature clear deserve complete study postpone future work. particular, would interesting nd identities ensuring cancellation divergences non-planar diagrams. also hope could shed new light large n theories. 16 writing nal notes seminars given marseille, strasbourg leipzig, two independent preprints dealing related issues appeared. rst one {$9603053$}, similar results obtained noncommutative r4 second one {$9603053$} devoted 2+1 dimensional case. aknowledgements pleasure us thank b. iochum t. schucker helpful advice, well c.p. martin d. kreimer correspondance topics. also thank j. madore, provides us preliminary version {$9603053$} models studied.
