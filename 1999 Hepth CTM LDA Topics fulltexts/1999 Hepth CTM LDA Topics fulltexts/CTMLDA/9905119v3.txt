abstract

the klein-gordon system describing three scalar particles without
interaction is cast into a new form, by transformation of the momenta.
two redundant degrees of freedom are eliminated; we are left with a
covariant equation for a reduced wave function with three-dimensional
arguments. this new formulation of the mass-shell constraints is cer-
tainly equivalent to the original kg system in a sector characterized by
positivity of the energies and, if the mass dierences are not too large,
by a moderately relativistic regime.
introducing mutual interactions allows for a model which is tractable
by expansion in negative powers of the total squared mass.

pacs 11.10.qr relativistic wave equations

1 introduction

1.1 motivations

relativistic particle dynamics is concerned by situations where the par-
ticles we consider are not signicantly created or anihilated, whereas
other relativistic eects must be taken into account. in principle the
description of such particles should result from a specialization of quan-
tum eld theory (qft) to its n-body sector.

this line leads to the famous integral equation of bethe and salpeter
(bs) in the two-body case. three-body generalizations have soon been
considered in the litterature [1]. more recently see [2][3]. for n > 2 how-
ever, the complexity of the bs approach seems to be almost prohibitive
as far as practical applications are concerned.
an alternative approach, based upon rst principles [4] [5], uses n mass-
shell constraints in the form of coupled wave equations where interaction
terms can be either phenomenological or derived from qft [6]. this
method shares with bs equation the property of manifest relativistic
invariance, realized at the price of dealing with redundant degrees of
freedom, since the arguments of the wave function are four-vectors. in
the two-body case, there is a clue for eliminating the redundant degree
of freedom: the sum of wave equations rules the dynamics, whereas
their dierence allows to determine how the wave function depends on
the relative time. this dependence turns out to be trivial and one is
left with a three-dimensional problem.
in the three-body case we have to cope with two relative times. these
superuous degrees of freedom are present as well in the three-body ver-
sions of the bs equation. their elimination (or factorization) is desirable
for physical interpretation; it would produce (after diagonalization of the
total linear momentum) a reduced wave equation which is covariant but
similar to a schroedinger equation with three-dimensional arguments.
unfortunately, the simple procedure utilized in the two-body case does
not work for n > 2.

an important issue of n-body dynamics is cluster separability; but a
less restrictive and more essential requirement is global separability:
one must at least recover free-particle motion when all interactions are
put equal to zero. models violating global separability have been con-
sidered in the past [7][8], mainly for their computational simplicity, but
we belive that any reasonable formulation of n-body dynamics must in-
clude free motion as a limit when all the terms carrying interactions are
switched o.
in sofar as fermions are concerned, these matters have been discussed
earlier in the literature [9] [10].

for scalar particles with masses ma, free motion can be described by n
klein-gordon (kg) equations, say (p2
a)  = 0 where  depends
on the momenta p1, ....pn. we can give a sharp timelike value k to the
total linear momentum and use the dierences of these equations. in
the two-body case, it follows that the relative time (or alternatively the

a  m2

dynamical variable

(p1  p2)  k/k2, which is conjugate to it) arises

only in a trivial factor of the wave function.
but this procedure is unable to produce any simplication as soon as n >
2. so we face this diculty that even for free particles, the usual form
of the equations of motion fails to permit the elimination of superuous
degrees of freedom.
this point may seem to be academic, because a system of noninter-
acting particles has no bound state, which renders a three-dimensional
formulation unnecessary. but we bear in mind the eventuality of intro-
ducing interactions that ultimately give rise to bound states. therefore
the possibility of a reduction is essential and should survive in the free
case.

in this paper we focus on three-body systems and we rstly consider
the case of noninteracting particles. let us stress that the free system is
not considered on its own right, but rather as preliminary to the further
introduction of mutual interactions.

since the kg equations as they stand do not permit a factorization
of the dependence on relative times, it is natural to transform these
equations into an equivalent system such that two superuous degrees
of freedom can be desentangled from the kinematics.
an early attempt to carry out this task for an arbitrary number of
particles was made by sazdjian [10][11] ten years ago. here, however, we
shall be concerned with the 3-body case only, and shall take advantage
of a simplication that is not possible for n > 3.
our aim is to eliminate two degrees of freedom in such a way that
the mass-shell constraints reduce to a covariant problem with three-
dimensional arguments. ultimate introduction of interactions will be
briey sketched at the end. of course, the poincare invariance of kine-
matics must be preserved and all particles should be treated on equal
footing (democracy). these conditions are not likely to select a unique
scheme, but if we intend to make it as simple as possible, there are not
too many choices.
we perform a rearrangement of the individual coordinates (well known
in celestial mechanics) which is adapted to the consideration of relative
variables. we insist on having invertible formulas, which is necessary
in order to make sure that the new form of the equations of motion is
equivalent to the original kg system.

section 2 is devoted to an exposition of the notation used and of the
basic useful equations of relativistic dynamics. in section 3 we collect
known results and perform elementary manipulations.
in section 4, using the heliocentric variables, we construct in closed
form a transformation of the free-particle system and discuss under

3

which conditions this transformation is invertible.
briey indicate how mutual interaction could be introduced.

in section 5, we

beware that zab is not conjugate to yab. we obviously have the following
relations

x ya = 0,

ya  yb = (pa  pb) = 2yab

(5)

yab + ya  yb = 0,

epa = eya

the tilde symbol denotes projection orthogonal to p , in other words
eza =  za, with  =   (p  p )/p 2. similarly, the hat
eya =  ya,
symbol refers to the projection orthogonal to k, eigenvalue of p . for
instance

a = y

a = y

heliocentric variables
the problem of relative times cannot be easily handled unless we rst
choose a set of independent relative variables. for this end, one particle
is arbitrarily picked up; let it be particle with label one. with respect
to particle 1, the relative conguration variables are dened like in [7].

za = q1  qa

4

(6)

where the capital labels a, b, c run only from 2 to n. from (3) it follows
that za is conjugate to ya.
let us now specialize to three-body systems; we can write

y12 = y2 +

1
2

y3

y13 = y3 +

1
2

y2

z12 + z23 + z31 = 0

(7)

(8)

notice that eqs (1-5) hold true for any n, whereas (7)(8) are valid for
n = 3 only. it is clear that q, z2, z3 are independent conguration vari-
ables. in the same way p, y2, y3 are independent momentum variables,
canonically conjugate to them. we can use the set of canonical variables
q, z2, z3, p, y2, y3 in place of q1, q2, q3, p1, p2, p3, this change is trivial.
in this heliocentric formulation, democracy among the three particles
is of course not kept manifest but can be checked at various stages of
the development. a similar re-arrangement, showing up two relative
momenta, is of current use in (newtonian) celestial mechanics.

among the quantities pab we shall more specially need to evaluate
p12, p13. they are given by

p12 =

2
3

p + y3

p13 =

2
3

p + y2

(9)

we shall also need the canonical expression of y12, y13, given by (7).
it will be convenient to replace eqs (1) by their sum and their dierences;
to this end we dene

a =

(m2

so the equal-mass case is characterized by the vanishing of both 1, 2.

equations (1) can obviously be written

(pa  pb)2

(13)

valid for any sum of n squares in a commutative algebra. we obtain

3x m2  = p 2  + x

(pa  pb)2 

a<b

(14)

in terms of the relative variables (see eq. (7)) we have another identity
specic of the three-body problem

x

a<b

(pa  pb)2  6(y2

2 + y2

3 + y2  y3)

(15)

now in the r.h.s. of (15) we separate time from space according to the
direction of p , and insert the result into (14). we get

x

a<b

(pa  pb)2 = d + 6p 2

where

d = 6(ey2

2 + ey2

3 + ey2  ey3)

 = (p 2)2[(y2  p )2 + (y3  p )2 + (y2  p )(y3  p )]

thus the sum of eqs (1) is

(3x m2  p 2)  = (d + 6p 2) 

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

the remaining combinations of (1) can easily be written as the dier-
ence equations

y12  p12  = 2 ,

y13  p13  = 3 

(20)

now it is natural to require that  is also eigenstate of the total mo-
mentum, say

p  = k

(21)

for some timelike constant vector k. but (in contrast to what happens
in the two-body case) this procedure is unable of getting rid of the

quantities ya  k/k2 conjugate to the relative times za  k/k2.

nevertheless, we can look for a new set of canonical variables; if these
variables are suitably choosen, equations (20) may after all result in the
elimination of two degrees of freedom.

a transformation in momentum space will be enough to induce the suit-
able transformation among operators. in fact we are going to construct
the quantum analog of a point transformation in momentum space (see
appendix 1).
let us start with a wave function (p1, p2, p3). perform a change in the
space of its arguments

or equivalently p 7 p  = p and ya 7 y

(25)

(26)

with summation also over (repeated) capital indices. in these formulas
it is clear that the transformation of momenta must be invertible.
beware that q may not coincide with q because of y/p . in addition,
we observe that the new relative coordinates actually mix the old ones.
however, we shall prove later (section 5) that this dicculty disappears
in the large-total-mass limit.

it is in order to stress that nding the desired transformation amounts
to solve a problem in the framework of c-numbers. the question of
inverting formulas, discussed below, is nothing but a nonlinear problem
concerning the arguments of the wave function. since it is specied that
we are dealing with momentum representation, we shall use without
confusion the same symbols for the arguments of the wave function and
the multiplicative operators they dene.

for a better understanding of the mathematical structure, it is perhaps
relevant to notice that q and z
a are formally hermitian in this sense
that they are symmetric operators in

l2(r12) = l2(r12, d4p d4y
whereas q and zb are symmetric operators in

2 d4y

indeed
2 maps l2 onto l2, so  (resp.  ) belongs to
multiplication by |j|
the rigged-hilbert space constructed by taking l2 (resp. l2) as hilbert
space. although l2 (resp. l2) has no direct physical meaning, it allows
for representing the poincare algebra and gives a rigorous status to the
operators involved in the wave equations.
since pa are multiplicative operators, they commute with j, so the mass-
shell constraints can be written either as (1) for  or equivalently in the
form (pa  ma)2 = 0, with each pa expressed in terms of p
b.

in momentum space, the lorentz group is characterized by this property
that it leaves all the products pa  pb unchnged.
provided all the p
b can be expressed as functions of pc  pd and vice-
versa, the same realization of the lorentz group can be as well charac-
terized by invariance of all the scalar products pcpd. in such a situation,
although m  = p q  p may be distinct from m = p q  p, their com-
ponents span the same lie algebra. moreover j being conserved by
rotations, it follows that m and m  are both symmetric in l2 and also
in l2.
till now we have considered a large class of transformations, character-
ized by equations (25)(26); the classical limit (h  0) of such formulas
would dene point transformations in momentum space.
we now specialize to a transformation which allows for eliminating the
superuous degrees of freedom. all we need is an invertible transforma-
tion such that

p12  y12 = p  y

p13  y13 = p  y

and just transform their time components in the way dictated by eqs
(27). this choice obviously preserves lorentz invariance; we shall prove
below that it does not destroy the democracy among particles.

translation invariance was ensured from the outset by assuming that
p  = p .
lorentz invariance is preserved because all the quadratic scalar quanti-
ties formed with the vectors p, y2, y3 are scalar invariant under space-
time rotations.
democracy between particles is not manifest in the heliocentric nota-
tion. nevertheless it is not dicult to check that our way of transform-
ing momentum variables treats all three particles on the same footing.
indeed we rst observe that (32) entails ey
1 = ey1, which amounts to
nally write ey
a = eya for the three particles. then using (12) and (4) we
realize that (27) automatically imply a third relation p23  y23 = p  y
23.

4.2

inversion of formulas

now that all components of the new momenta p
a are determined we
can (in principle) evaluate the conguration variables through formulas
(25)(26). it is essential to realize that our transformation of the mo-
menta among themselves must be invertible:
if it were not, the trans-
formation would not be canonical and the new form given to the wave
equations would not be equivalent with the kg system.
formula (25) can be written in closed form provided we are able to carry
out this inversion. we are thus faced with the problem of mapping the
new momenta back onto the old ones, which amounts to solve the system
(38)(39) now for the unknown y2  p, y3  p in terms of y
3  p ,
assuming this time that the latter are given and taking (32) into account.

2  p, y

positive-energy condition
the domain where (38)(39) must be inverted can be limited to the
positive-energy sector. so we require not only that p is timelike and
future oriented, but also that every vector pa is timelike and points
toward the future, which entails p  pa > 0 and pa  pb > 0.
at this stage it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless quantities

for the sake of a physical interpretation, investigating the behavior of
our formulas at large p 2 is of interest. equations (49)(50) show that,

 = 2v  u + o(1/p 2)

(63)

proposition (i) stated above ensures that the transformation from the

old momenta to the new ones is safely invertible in an open set of values
given to the couple , . as these quantities are rst integrals for free
particles, their limitation to an interval denes a sector which is invari-
ant by the motion. characterization of this sector in terms of physical
quantities will be discussed below.

could be exhibited. but we can enlarge the interval for  only at the
price of shrinking the one for .

4.3 physical conditions

in view of eqs. (28), the wave function includes a factor (y

limited by the constraints y

in the denitions of , .

12  p 
13  p  3). the relevant domain for the arguments of  is thus
1ap = a, where the masses are given from
1a  p by a in (48) or

the particular case where  vanishes is interesting because it arises when
the particles are mutually at rest, provided m2 = m3 which encompasses
the equal-mass case. moreover  remains small insofar as 2, 3 and the
velocities are not too large.
for simplicity, let us focus on the assumption that 2, 3 are small
enough. in order to keep some contact with nonrelativistic mechanics,
our scheme must encompass the case  = 0; thus the solution which
reduces to x  for vanishing  is excluded. since the transformation of
momenta must be one-to-one, we are also obliged to discard the solutions
which reduce to the xed point for vanishing .
finally we have no other choice than the solution given by x = s(, ).

let us discuss in more detail how we can manage, by simple physical
requirements, to keep ,  within admissible values allowing to apply
proposition i.
for instance, in the domain where the arguments of  vary we can
impose a democratic condition

|ey2

for some xed positive and dimensionless bound b which will be ad-

therefore

|  0| < 9b
|  0| < 3b
0 = 3(2  3)/p 2.

where 0 = 3(2 + 3)/p 2,
provided 0 and 0 belong to the safety interval ( 1
2 ), a condition of
the form (64) ensures that  and  have the same property. in order to
realize this situation we are led to restrict the squared-mass dierences
by the condition

2 , 1

|2  3| <

p 2

(65)

then, condition (64)with a suitable b permits to apply proposition i.

for the sake of a simple kinematic interpretation, we may replace (64)
by the more restrictive condition

a| < b x m2
|ep2

(66)

which has the advantage of not involving p . indeed the positive-energy

assumption entails for free particles that p 2  p m2 therefore (66)

implies (64). we can also replace (65) by the more severe condition

|2  3| < x m2

6

(67)

this approach is well-suited for the equal-mass case and remain useful
when the mass dierences are not too large.
for example assume that ma = m = m1, hence x m2 = (1 + 22)m2
1.
we nd that (67) is satised provided the square-mass ratio satises

it is clear that (66) is a condition on the three-dimensional velocities
with respect to the rest frame. although it puts a bound on these
quantities, it still leaves room for a large class of relativistic motions.

consider for instance the equal-mass case, ma = m, both a vanish.
we are sure that ,  belong to the safety interval if we demand that

now what does mean (68) in terms of (newtonian) velocities ? in the

rest frame, ep2
(68) is satised provided w2 <
under this limit, which is about 0.37 of the velocity of light, we shall
speak of a moderately relativistic regime.

, which corresponds to |w| < 1/7.

. thus

for inequal masses, similar results could be derived, but the discussion
would become a bit complicated. we summarize:
proposition ii
in sofar as the mass dierences are not too large, we keep the range
of ,  under control by restrictions on the magnitude of the velocities.
if in particular we consider three equal masses, velocities under 1/7
ensure that we can invert our formulas with s(, ) as in proposition i.
all the quantities involved in condition (64) (resp. (66)) are rst inte-
grals for free particles, thus (64) (resp. (66)) denes an invariant sector
of the motion.

4.4 new form of wave equation

as seen in section 4.1, the dierence equations are (28) or equivalently
(29)(30). according to (19) the dynamical equation (sum equation) for
free particles is

(3x m2

a  p 2)  = (d + 6p 2) 
of course  must be here considered as a function of y
in view of (55)(59) we can write as well

(69)

2p, y

3p, p 2, eya.

(70)

where x = s(, ) according to (61)(62). we must remember that , 
are functions of the new momenta through (48).
but equation (28) tells that on the mass shell we can replace y
by a (thus y

1a  p
a replaced accordingly, see eqs. (29) (30) ). in the wave

17

equation,  can therefore be replaced by g, where g is obtained after
making this substitution in (48).
let g = [] with, for all f , with this convention that

[f ] = subs (y

1a  p = a,

f )

(71)

using an obvious notation borrowed from maples syntaxis. we can
write

where [], [] are 3([u]  [v]) respectively and
p 2[v] = 3  (ey2  ey3 +
p 2[u] = 2  (ey2  ey3 +
it is noteworthy that [] and [] are of the order of 1/p 2.
the sum equation is now replaced by

ey
notice that, apart from xed parameters, g depends only on ey
2,
3
and p 2. the only operators involved in (74) are multiplications by p 2
and by the projections of y
a detailed writting of g in closed form is in principle possible, since
the analytic expression for s results from solving a 4th degree algebraic
equation. but this expression would be tremendously complicated. in
applications we have better to develop g at any desired order in powers
of 1/p 2, which is easy for, after making the required substitutions,
formula (62) gets transformed into a development of [s] in powers of
1/p 2 that we insert into (72) so we obtain

g =

[]2
12

+

[]2
4

+ o(1/(p 2)3)

(75)

since [] and [] are of the order of 1/p 2, this development of g is of the
order of 1/(p 2)2. remark: from (62) we could develop g untill order
1/(p 2)3 explicitly included.

imposing by (21) that total linear momentum is diagonal permits, through
equation (31), to eliminate y
relative time. it is of interest to notice that the new relative times are
linear combinations of the old ones with coecients that are analytic
functions of the momenta; the reader will check it using (25)(26)(42)
and (48)(36)(37).

ak/k2 is conjugate to a new

(76)

according to (17) we shall write for instance

d = 6[(by

then, equation (75) entails that

(g)k =

(77)

notice that  and  are of the order of 1/k2. it is therefore natural to
set

k2 (g)k =

(78)

1
k2 and it turns out

indeed  can be expanded in nonnegative powers of

that its zeroth order term is biquadratic in by
a.
for instance, for equal masses we simply have

(0) = (by2

we end up with

(3x m2

(79)

free-particle motion is now described only in terms of by and k with

no more degrees of freedom than in the non-relativistic problem. but
we must keep in mind that this picture is valid only in sofar as we can
revert to all the initial variables, which (at least for equal masses) is
ensured for moderately relativistic velocities.

5 how to introduce interactions

we can now consider the system (69) (29)(30) as a starting point for
introducing mutual interactions.
to this end, we shall modify the sum equation (69) by a term which
carries interaction, whereas the dierence equations (29)(30) remain
untouched.
similarly we manage that p remains conserved, and keep assuming that
its eigenvalue is a timelike vector k; therefore the factorization of  given
by formula (31) remains valid and eliminates two degrees of freedom.

a, y

the interaction potential will be written in closed form in terms of the
reducible coordinates z
b, and all calculations will be carried out
using these variables.
remark: the reducible (momentum) coordinates p
to form the quantities p and y
the physical interpretation of the new conguration variables z
a is not
straightforward; they are relative variables since they commute with p ,
but they suer from this complication that the transformation formulas
(25) mix z2 with z3. this point will be claried in subsection 5.1.

a are re-arranged as

a.

adding interaction into (69) produces the dynamical equation

(3x m2

a  p 2) = d  + (18v + 6p 2) 

(80)

like in the free case, d is given by (17) and  is given by (70) in terms
of x = s(, ).
the dierence equations remain (29)(30) like previously. of course,
v cannot be chosen arbitrarily but it is not dicult to nd a general
admissible form of v such that the dynamical equation (80) is compat-
ible with (29)(30). compatibility requires that v commutes with the
operators in the left-hand sides of (29)(30). for instance the interaction

naturally v must be poincare invariant, which is realized by taking a

potential v may depend on ez
function of the various scalar products formed with ez
demanding that  diagonalizes p  with eigenvalue k, with k  k > 0,
we can in (80) replace ey by by.
taking (29)(30) and (78) into account yields the reduced equation

comparison with a standard problem of nonrelativistic quantum me-

chanics becomes more easy in the rest frame, where (bz

actually solving (81) would be equivalent to a non-relativistic problem,
except for the last term which involves the momenta but does not de-
pend on the shape of the interaction (and survives in the free-motion
limit). fortunately, this term is of the order of 1/k2, which opens the
possibility of making an approximation, under suitable conditions.

(82)

where ab are coupling constants and uab arbitrary (but poincare in-
variant) functions. in this model, u12 is independent from q

cyclic permutation.

that is when

at this stage, solving eq. (83) amounts to study a nonrelativistic poten-
tial model. further corrections will be obtained by an expansion of  in
powers of 1/k2. the rst nontrivial correction involves (0) as dened
in subsection 4.4.

5.1 cluster behaviour

as pointed out by sazdjian [10], in any formulation of the dynamics
which makes explicit reference to total momentum, it is dicult to dis-
cuss cluster separability. but it is reasonable to demand that the reduced
equation be in a sense separable, in order to ensure a factorization of
the internal wave function when there are noninteracting clusters.
with this requirement in mind, we can already observe that the poten-
tial (82) is formally separable in terms of the variables z.
but the interpretation of each uab as a two-body term runs into a com-
plication: there is no evidence that the variable z
a, exactly matches

21

3  z

the cluster of particles {1a}. a similar remark arises concerning the
matching of z
2 with cluster {23}. the possible discrepancy stems
from the fact that (beside its dependence on total momentum) each new
variable q
a depends not only on qa (with the same label a) but also on
all qbs with b 6= a. this dependence is expressed by the transformation
formulas (25). fortunately, we shall prove that:

6 concluding remarks

as a rst step, we succeeded in constructing three mass-shell constraints
describing the free motion of three scalar particles. in contrast to the
kg system, these new wave equations permit to eliminate two degrees of
freedom and get reduced to a covariant equation with three-dimensional
arguments.
our approach rests on a transformation of the momenta involved in
the original kg system. in contradistinction to sazdjians proposal and

23

the homographic relations that approximate it (eq (13) of ref. [10], eq
(4.15) of ref.
[11]), our transformation from the old momenta to the
new ones is explicitly given by simple quadratic formulas. inversion of
these formulas is a fourth degree algebraic problem which could be (in
principle) discussed and solved in closed form; due to its complexity,
approximate developments are more ecient in practical calculations.
we used a couple of identities that are specic of the three-body case;
extension of the present work to n > 3 is by no means straightforward!
in the present state of the art, equivalence of the new equation (74)
with the sum of the original kg equations is ensured at least in a large
sector characterized by positive energies and conditions that involve the
masses of the particles. when the masses are not too dierent one from
another (and in particular for equal masses), these conditions amount
to impose a bound on the velocities; but this bound is still high enough
to allow for the description of a relativistic regime.
the case of very large velocities requires further investigations. we gave
here sucient conditions for an invertible transformation; it remains
possible that a more detailed discussion enlarges the present results.
this analysis of free-body kinematics provides us with a solid ground.

in a second step, we introduced interaction in the sum equation. the
model obtained by this procedure respects poincare invariance. it re-
mains covariantly reducible to a wave equation with three-dimensional
arguments; it is globally separable, in this sense that free motion is
recovered in the absence of interaction term.
for a large class of interactions, the reduced equation gets drastically
simplied (and takes on a familiar form) in the large-total-mass limit;
actually, the interaction term v is cluster separable in this limit. an
approximation method using expansion in powers of 1/k2 is available
for computing the internal wave function.
in order to carry out applications to three-nucleons systems, we plan
an extension of the formalism to particles with spin. the contact with
more elaborated (but more complicated) theories, such as qed and
qcd, will be discussed in a future work.

appendix 1

in non-relativistic classical mechanics, canonical transformations are
symplectic dieomorphisms of phase space.
in general they do mix
the qs and the ps.
but a point transformation (in conguration space) simply transforms
the qs among themselves, say q = f (q). then invariance of the sym-
plectic form [12] fully determines the ps in terms of the qs and the ps.

24

when conguration space is at, the q and p variables play symmetric
roles in the general formulas of analytic mechanics, so there is no di-
culty in dening as well point transformations in momentum space (but
this possibility is not usually considered in textbooks). in this case, one
transforms the momenta among themselves, and one further determines
the new variables q in terms of qs and ps through the requirement that
the complete transformation law is canonical.
in the position (resp. momentum) representation of quantum mechan-
ics, a quantum analog of point transformations in conguration (resp.
momentum) space can be generated by an invertible transformation of
the arguments of the wave function. this transformation among c-
numbers obviously induces a transformation among the multiplicative
operators they dene.
