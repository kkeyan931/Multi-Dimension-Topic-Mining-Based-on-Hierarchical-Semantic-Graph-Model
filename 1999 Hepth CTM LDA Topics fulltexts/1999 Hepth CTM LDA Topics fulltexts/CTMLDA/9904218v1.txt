on the twisted chiral potential in 2d and the analogue of rigid special

abstract

we discuss how to obtain an n = (2, 2) supersymmetric su(3) gauge theory in
two dimensions via geometric engineering from a calabi-yau 4-fold and compute its

non-perturbative twisted chiral potential fw (). the relevant compact part of the

4-fold geometry consists of two intersecting ip1s bered over ip2. the rigid limit of
the local mirror of this geometry is a complex surface that generalizes the seiberg-
witten curve and on which there exist two holomorphic 2-forms. these stem from
the same meromorphic 2-form as derivatives w.r.t. the two moduli, respectively. the
middle periods of this meromorphic form give directly the twisted chiral potential.
the explicit computation of these and of the four-point yukawa couplings allows for
a non-trivial test of the analogue of rigid special geometry for a 4-fold with several
moduli.

1 introduction

the embedding of supersymmetric gauge theories into the framework of string theory
and the subsequent application of symmetries and dualities of the latter has shown
to be an extremely fruitful approach to the study of non-perturbative properties
of gauge systems. one way to proceed is to exploit the fact that type iia string
theory gives rise to non-abelian gauge symmetries when compactied on certain sin-
gular calabi-yau manifolds. these are naturally k3-brations and a gauge theory of
ade-type arises when the k3 ber develops a corresponding singularity. geometric
engineering [1] furthermore exploits the fact that in the eld theory limit the rel-
evant part of the compactication geometry is the local singularity structure. this
allows us, for the purpose of extracting eld theoretical properties, to just model
manifolds that exhibit the correct conguration of exceptional divisors (ip1s that
occur in resolving the singularities of the k3 ber and whose intersection matrix
equals the negative of the cartan matrix of the respective gauge group) bered over
the appropriate base.

the literature on geometric engineering of n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories
in four dimensions is already vast. in this paper we follow [2] in applying this method
to calabi-yau 4-folds, which leads to n = (2, 2) supersymmetric gauge theories in
two dimensions. the specic example we will investigate is an su(3) gauge theory.
this implies that the local compactication geometry on the type iia side contains
two intersecting ip1s bered over a common compact complex two dimensional base,
which we take to be a ip2. the rigid limit of the local mirror to this geometry is
a complex surface, which plays the role of the seiberg-witten curve.
in analogy
to the 3-fold case, this surface is no longer a calabi-yau manifold as it was in the
su(2) example of [2]. instead, it has two holomorphic 2-forms that stem from the
same meromorphic 2-form as the derivatives w.r.t. the two moduli, respectively. a
major novelty of 4-folds, as compared to 3-folds, is that 4-forms are no longer dual
to 2-forms but represent an independent part of the cohomology. in particular the
primitive subspace of h 2,2
 (x), will play a
predominant role. it is related to the occurrence of 4-uxes a, which as well as part
of the intersection form (2) on this subspace appear in the twisted chiral potential

 (x), i.e. the one generated by forms in h 1,1

(1)

fw . it is given by

fw =   (2)  d1 ,

where d1 are the middle periods of the meromorphic 2-form on the rigid surface.

we will explicitly compute these periods and the four-point yukawa couplings
and then perform a non-trivial test of the generalization of rigid special geometry
to 4-folds with several moduli. recall that for 3-folds, x3, special geometry implies
that the prepotential f of the complex structure moduli space is given in terms of
the periods z i, fj of the holomorphic 3-form w.r.t. a symplectic basis of h3(x3, z)
as f = 1
2z ifi(z). the three-point yukawa couplings are then given by c(3) = 3f ,
where derivatives are w.r.t. the special projective coordinates z i. we will verify that

1

for 4-folds the analogous structure in the rigid limit is given byfw as in (1) and by

c(4)  (2d1)  (2)  (2d1) .

we will make this more precise in the following.

the computation of the four-point yukawa couplings is done in a global model of
the compact calabi-yau 4-fold, a realization of which is given by the resolution of the
fermat hypersurface of degree 36 in the weighted projective space ip5(18, 12, 3, 1, 1, 1),
which according to common convention we will call x36(18, 12, 3, 1, 1, 1). this man-
ifold does not only represent a k3 bration over ip2, but the k3 is itself a bration
of an algebraic 2-torus over ip1. such elliptically bered 4-folds are interesting in
themselves as they give rise to phenomenologically more interesting n = 1 super-
symmetric gauge theories in four dimensions when used as compactication manifolds
for f -theory [3].

2 the holomorphic fayet-iliopoulos potentials

it is well known that for generic points in the moduli space spanned by the gauge
multiplets the non-abelian gauge group of n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories
is broken down to the maximal abelian torus. hence we will have to consider an
eective gauge theory with n = (2, 2) supersymmetry and abelian gauge group u(1)k
in two dimensions, where in our specic example k = 2. the superelds appearing
in such theories comprise k real vector superelds va, a = 1, . . . , k, with component
expansion

va = 

2( vz,a + + +vz,a   +a  +  a)
+ i(2   ,a  2,a) +

r chiral superelds i, i = 1, . . . , r, obeying d+i = di = 0, with component
expansion

i = i + 2(++,i + ,i) + 2fi + . . .

,

where . . . are total derivative terms, as well as their complex conjugates i. as a
novelty of two dimensions there are in addition twisted chiral superelds a, a =
1, . . . , k, that satisfy d+a = da = 0. their component expansion reads

a =

d+dva

= a  i2(++,a + ,a) + 2+ (da  ifa) + . . .

.

(2)

the most general lagrangian involving these superelds consists of a generalized
kahler potential k(, , , ) as well as holomorphic chiral and twisted chiral po-

tentials, w () andfw ().

2

for generic points in the moduli space the chiral matter elds will be massive, so
that in the infrared, after having them integrated out, we are left with only the twisted
chiral elds as the light degrees of freedom and an eective action involving k(, )

andfw (). taking the scaling dimension of  to equal 1, the kahler potential has to

be multiplied by the squared inverse of a dimensionful gauge coupling and therefore
becomes irrelevant in the infrared. the twisted chiral potential on the other hand
generalizes the fayet-iliopoulos term

and gives rise to eective, eld dependent, complex fi couplings

that supersymmetry is broken unless a() = 0 for all a = 1, . . . , k.

3 the twisted chiral potential via string theory

in compactications of type iia string theory on a calabi-yau 4-fold x, the twisted
chiral superelds a of the resulting two dimensional gauge theory are in one-to-
one correspondence with kahler classes in h 1,1
 (x), while the chiral matter elds
i correspond to the complex structure moduli belonging to h 3,1
 (x). the twisted

a line bundle over the moduli space of kahler deformations of x. since the type ii

chiral potentialfw () is holomorphic in the s and is thus a holomorphic section of
dilaton resides in a dierent multiplet, fw () does not receive any quantum space-
time corrections and we can restrict ourselves to string tree level. neverthelessfw ()

3

suers from non-perturbative corrections due to embeddings of the worldsheet (ip1,
since we are in string tree-level) into x, i.e. from worldsheet instantons. these lead to

quantum corrections of the kahler moduli space of x that show up infw (). the way

to compute these corrections is to use mirror symmetry, which allows us to consider
instead type iia string theory on the mirror manifold x , while the kahler moduli
space of x is mapped to the complex structure moduli space of x  (isomorphic to
h 3,1
 (x )) and vice versa. here the twisted chiral potential is a holomorphic section
of a line bundle over the moduli space of complex structure deformations of x ; as
such, it receives no quantum corrections at all.

as was done in [2], we can identify the tree-level correlator we have to compute

in order to obtain fw () by considering the following tree-level chern-simons term

in ten dimensional type iia string theory

lcs = b  f4  f4 ,

where f4 is the eld strength of the rr 3-form eld of type iia theory. we expand
the above forms in topological bases {o(i)

where fa is the eld strength of the twisted chiral supereld, related to the component
fa in the expansion (2) of a by fa = fad2x, with d2x the volume form on the
complement of x. actually the expansion in the space h 2,2
 (x) is restricted to its
primitive subspace, whose dimension we denote by h2,2. novel to 4-folds as compared
to 3-folds is the role played by elements o(2)
and their corresponding coecients b.
denoting the dual cycles in h4(x, z) by {b}, we have

and it is known [7] that at the quantum level these 4-uxes have to be integers (or
possibly half-integers if p1
4 is not an integral class). using the above expansion we
obtain

c ix ,

where nb = 1/(2)r fb is the rst chern class of the bth u(1) bundle, i.e. the instan-

ton number of the bth gauge factor. note that the correlator on the right hand side is
a yukawa coupling in a topological sigma model, known as the a model [8], which is
obtained by twisting the superconformal sigma model on the worldsheet with target
space x. the algebra of observables of this model is identied with the quantum
deformation of the classical intersection algebra on a = d
p=0h p(x,pt x), where d
is the complex dimension of x. another twist leads to the b model, whose algebra of
p=0h p(x,pt x) = d
observables is the algebra on b = d
p=0h p(x,dpt x). mir-
ror symmetry relates the a and b models to each other on a pair of mirror manifolds .

it was shown in [911] how to compute the frobenius subalgebra of a corresponding
to the primitive part of the vertical cohomology of x around the large radius point,
which is entirely determined in terms of the two- and three-point functions. for the
case of several moduli, the authors of [10, 11] found in particular that the couplings
c (1,1,d2)
(x)  c are given by the period integrals
of the holomorphic d-form on the mirror x  as

here ta are the periods linear in logarithms1 and (2)
d are the quadratic ones, both in
a gauge such that the unique series solution for the periods around the large complex
structure point is equal to 1. on the other hand, (2)
dc are purely topological two-
point functions. they dene a metric on the primitive subspace of h 2,2
 (x) by the
cup product pairing on a xed topological basis {o(2)
a } of this subspace as
b i =zx o(2)

via mirror symmetry it coincides with the analogous cup product pairing between b
model observables on the mirror x , which are related to the above basis elements
o(2)
a by the mirror map. hence (2) is a symmetric, invertible h2,2  h2,2 matrix with
integer entries. we denote its inverse by (2).
our situation diers from that above in that we are interested in the point of
the string moduli space where an enhanced gauge symmetry arises, which is not
the large radius point. furthermore we will take the eld theory limit in which
gravitational and stringy modes decouple. in this limit the mirror x  turns into a
complex surface wrig, which we will call the local rigid surface. the attribute local
refers to the fact that it is determined by the local singularity structure of x, i.e. the
bration of exceptional divisors of the resolved k3 over the base ip2. in particular
the number of twisted chiral superelds that do not decouple in this limit is given
by the number k of such exceptional divisors. moreover, as was established in [12]
for 3-folds, there exists a map f : h4(x , z)  h2(wrig, z), such that the subset
of periods of the holomorphic 4-form (4,0) on x  that form a closed monodromy
problem by themselves is given in the rigid limit by periods of a meromorphic 2-form

 on wrig as r (4,0)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)rigid

= rf () . these periods give the scalar components of

the twisted chiral superelds not decoupling in the rigid limit and of their magnetic
duals. in [2] it turned out that in the resulting u(1)k gauge theory the role of the
at coordinates ta is played by the k series solutions a of the periods of  and
that the (2)
d are replaced by the k logarithmic solutions d1,d. the latter arise as
1these are the at coordinates on the complex structure moduli space of x , i.e. the ones in
which the gauss-manin connection on the bundle b = h d(x , c) over this moduli space is at.
under the mirror map they become the at coordinates on the moduli space of the complexied
kahler structure of x.

periods over cycles that are the image under the map f of 4-cycles in x , which are
dual to observables of the b model on x  that correspond, via the mirror map, to
elements of the primitive subspace of h 2,2

the indices a, b, c, d = 1, . . . , k correspond to the k indices in {1, . . . , h1,1(x)} and
{1, . . . , h2,2(x)}, respectively, which are related to periods surviving the eld theory
limit. furthermore we kept the symbol (2) for the resulting non-degenerate k  k
submatrix of (10).
in the following we will compute the periods a, d1,a (and d2,a)2 using geometric
engineering and in a subsequent subsection (3.2) the four-point yukawa coulings.
this will allow us to exhibit the analogue of rigid special geometry for 4-folds.

3.1 geometric engineering

the relevant part of the 4-fold geometry is most eciently described with the help
of toric geometry. doing so, the mori vectors describing the two intersecting ip1s
bered over a base ip2 (together with the canonical line bundle that will be irrelevant
for the purpose of this section) are

theory moduli space, we blow up the singular point (a, b, c) = (1/3, 1/3, 0) until we
get divisors with only normal crossings [13]. for one particular choice of coordinate

these sections have a geometric interpretation as period integrals of a meromorphic

for our specic example we can easily write down the equation for the local rigid
surface and the meromorphic 2-form . after shifting the t-variable such that the
quadratic term in t disappears from (15), and using (16) and (18), the local rigid
surface takes the form

wrig =(cid:26)z + w +

9
zw

+ pa2(x; u, v) = 0(cid:27) ,

with pa2(x; u, v) = x3  ux  v the simple singularity of type a2. equivalently we
can take the polynomial form

frig = z2w + zw2 + 9 + zwpa2(x; u, v) .

(34)

as for the seiberg-witten curve, this rigid surface is no longer a calabi-yau space.
rather, we expect to nd two holomorphic 2-forms that are derivatives of  w.r.t.
u and v, respectively. there are curves in the eld theory moduli space (spanned
by u and v) above which {frig(w, x, z) = 0} is a singular space. away from such
subvarieties, i.e. where frig denes a smooth surface, we can use the poincare residue
map to construct a holomorphic 2-form. indeed, whenever we have wfrig|{frig=0} 

p49z + z2(z + pa2)2 6= 0 a suitable meromorphic 2-form is given by
logh2z(z + pa2) + 2p49z + z2(z + pa2)2i dz  dx ,

are two holomorphic 2-forms, as we had expected. in the case wfrig|{frig=0} = 0, but

zfrig|{frig=0} p49w + w2(w + pa2)2 6= 0, we just have to trade z for w in the

above forms.

3 actually the blocks below the diagonal could be altered by a change of homology basis, which
adds series solutions to logarithmic ones and series and logarithmic solutions to double logarithmic
ones and would still meet our requirements. it is however important to notice that such a change
of basis leaves the relations (11) and (41) invariant and reects the indeterminacy mentioned above
(12).

3.2 the yukawa couplings and rigid special geometry

in (11) we had found that the second derivatives of the twisted chiral potential
are proportional to linear combinations of three-point yukawa couplings of the a
model with target space the calabi-yau 4-fold x. these couplings in turn were
identied with second derivatives of the logarithmic solutions to the period integrals
of a meromorphic 2-form over 2-cycles in the rigid surface. in the previous subsection
we used geometric engineering and local mirror symmetry to compute these periods.
the purpose of this subsection is to compute the four-point yukawa couplings directly
from the picard-fuchs system. this allows us to exhibit the structure that generalizes
rigid special geometry to 4-folds in an example with two moduli.

the 4-fold we used above is a non-compact toric calabi-yau manifold, more
precisely the total space of a canonical line bundle. this non-compactness did not
bother us as long as we were only interested in properties of the rigid local mirror
since, for these, only the compact base space of the bundle was relevant. on the
other hand, since the ring structure on the cohomology of a non-compact manifold
is not well dened, we need to use a global model of the compact calabi-yau 4-fold
x in order to compute the yukawa couplings (taking the eld theory limit not until
the end). as already alluded to in the introduction, such a model is furnished, for
example, by the fermat hypersurface of degree 36 in the resolution of the weighted
projective space ip5(18, 12, 3, 1, 1, 1), which we called x36(18, 12, 3, 1, 1, 1). this space
is a bration over ip2 with ber a k3 surface given as x12(6, 4, 1, 1) that is itself a
bration over ip1 with ber this time a 2-torus x6(3, 2, 1). note that this is the
same geometry as that of x24(12, 8, 2, 1, 1) [14, 15], except that the base ip1 of that
k3-bration has been traded for a ip2 base. since it is the family of k3-bers
that determines the gauge symmetries, most of the analysis is similar to the 3-fold
case [16].

the weighted projective space ip5(18, 12, 3, 1, 1, 1) is a toric variety whose fan

comprises the one-dimensional cones

1 = (1, 0, 0, 0, 0)
3 = (0, 0, 1, 0, 0)
5 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1)

,
,
,

2 = (0, 1, 0, 0, 0) ,
4 = (0, 0, 0, 1, 0) ,
6 = (18,12,3,1,1) .

they represent vertices of a reexive polyhedron , which contains in addition the
origin 0 as the only interior point, as well as the two integral vertices 7 = 1
3(4 +
5 + 6) and 8 = 1
6(33 + 4 + 5 + 6). the latter represent exceptional divisors that
are introduced in the process of resolving the quotient singularities of the weighted
projective space. the enlarged vertices, i = (1, i)  z6, satisfy three independent

i i, k = 1, 2, 3, which dene the mori vectors

relations 0 =p8

i=0 l(k)

l(1) = (6, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1)
l(2) = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1,3, 0)
l(3) = (0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1,2) .

11

(36)

applying standard techniques [1619] it follows that the mirror x  is again a hyper-
surface in the same weighted projective space ip5(18, 12, 3, 1, 1, 1), given by

in terms of the algebraic coordinates a = a3

the moduli space of complex structure deformations of x  the picard-fuchs system
for the periods i(a, b, c) of the holomorphic 4-form on x  reads

(37)

(38)

from the analysis of the x24(12, 8, 2, 1, 1) model in [14] we can furthermore infer that
the point of su(3) gauge symmetry enhancement is located in the string moduli space
in rescaled variables (x, y, z) = (432a, 27b, 4c) at (x, y, z) = (, 0, 1). expanding
around this point as

x =

23u3/2

y = 33 99

,

,

z = 1  23u3/2  33 3v ,

(39)

we indeed nd the discriminant of (38) to coincide with (19) at lowest order and up
to an irrelevant factor.

next, we compute the four-point yukawa couplings following [19]. this means
that we rst compute the four-point functions4 of the b model on x  directly from
the picard-fuchs system (38), transform them to the eld theory variables and to
the correct gauge and take the rigid limit. whereas in [19] this gauge was chosen
such that the unique fundamental period around the large complex structure point
was scaled to 1, in our situation it is xed by the requirement that the picard-fuchs
system (38), when transformed to this gauge, reduces in the eld theory limit to the
rigid system (22). the rigid limit of the a model four-point yukawa couplings is then
obtained by going to the at coordinates i. as has already been mentioned, the
four-point couplings are entirely determined by the two- and three-point functions
as

here (2) is the non-degenerate submatrix of the intersection form (10) on the primi-
tive subspace of h 2,2
 (x) corresponding to periods that survive the rigid limit. it is a
symmetric, invertible 2  2 matrix with integer coecients, whose inverse we denote
by (2). the constant of proportionality appearing in (41) is of course the same for all
couplings. having calculated the four-point functions and the periods, we can indeed
match the left and right sides of (41), which xes the constant of proportionality and
moreover determines the intersection form (2) to be the cartan matrix of su(3)

relations (12) and (41) represent the analogue of rigid special geometry for 4-folds
with several moduli, in the same sense that special geometry for 3-folds manifests
itself in the relations f = 1
2z ifi(z) for the prepotential f , where z i and fi are
periods of the holomorphic 3-form w.r.t. a symplectic basis of h3(x3, z) and cijk =
ijkf for the three-point yukawa couplings, where the derivatives are w.r.t. the
special projective coordinates z i. they are the rigid limit of the structure found
in [11] for the non-rigid case.

4 conclusion

we have investigated the eld theory limit of type iia string compactication on a
calabi-yau 4-fold whose relevant part for the purpose of extracting eld theoretic
properties consists of two intersecting ip1s bered over a common base ip2. the
rigid limit of the local mirror is a complex surface that generalizes the seiberg-witten
curve and on which there exist two holomorphic 2-forms that stem from the same
meromorphic 2-form as derivatives w.r.t. the two moduli.

the eective eld theory that is the appropriate description in the infrared is
an n = (2, 2) supersymmetric gauge theory in two dimensions with abelian gauge

group u(1)2. its twisted chiral potential is of the form fw =   (2)  d1, where 

is a vector of 4-uxes, (2) an intersection form and d1 a period vector. by explicit
computation of the period integrals as solutions of the picard-fuchs equations and
of the four-point yukawa couplings we were able to exhibit the generalization of rigid
special geometry to 4-folds in a non-trivial example with two moduli. this structure
manifests itself in the relation c(4) = (2d1) (2)  (2d1) between these four-point
functions and derivatives of the middle periods w.r.t. at coordinates.
we briey mention a number of conclusions about two-dimensional gauge theories
as derived from type iia compactications on 4-folds, which have already been dis-
cussed in [2] but apply to our example as well. the major novelty of 4-folds is the role
played by the primitive subspace of h 2,2
 (x) and its dual 4-cycles, respectively. they
lead to new discrete moduli of the gauge theories in two dimensions, the 4-uxes.
if they all vanish, the theory just exhibits a non-trivial kahler potential. but once
the 4-uxes are switched on, the structure of the theory becomes richer, as a twisted

13

chiral potential, fi couplings and a scalar potential are generated. generically the
last seems to break supersymmetry, as was the case in the one-modulus example
of [2]. the coecient of the logarithmic term in the fi couplings can furthermore be
interpreted as indicating the presence of massive chiral matter we had not accounted
for in the geometrical set-up. finally, the choice of base is not unambiguous, in
contrast to the case of 3-folds, but the instanton series depends on this choice. we
do not know how to interpret or resolve this ambiguity.

a the b model yukawa couplings

in this appendix we list the four-point yukawa couplings5 of the b model on x ,
which is the mirror to x36(18, 12, 3, 1, 1, 1). we write them in the rescaled algebraic
variables (x, y, z) and in order to shorten the exposition we introduce the following
abbreviations for the components of the discriminant of (38)
