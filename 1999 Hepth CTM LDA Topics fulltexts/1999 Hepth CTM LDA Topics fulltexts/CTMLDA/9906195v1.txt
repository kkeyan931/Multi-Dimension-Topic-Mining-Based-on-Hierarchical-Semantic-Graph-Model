abstract

we perform the quantization of a massive particle propagating on ads5.
we use the twistor formulation in which the action can be brought into a
quadratic form. we construct the brst operator which commutes with ads5
isometries forming su (2, 2). the condition of a consistent brst quantization
requires that the ads energy e is quantized in units of the ads5 radius r,
e = 1
2r (na + nb + 4), with na, nb being some non-negative integers. we also
argue that the mass operator will be identied with the moduli of the u (1)
central extension z of the su (2, 2|4) algebra in the supersymmetric case. the
spectrum of physical states with vanishing ghost number contains a particular
subset of massless su (2, 2) multiplets (including the bosonic part of the novel
short supermultiplets). we hope that our results will help to quantize also the
string on ads5.

the quantization of string theory on ads5  s5 is a complicated problem. one
of the main diculties is due to the non-linearities, present even in the bosonic part.
the action is not quadratic and hence dicult to quantize. it has been rst suggested
[1] to use the supertwistors forming the fundamental representation of su(2, 2|4) as
the fundamental variables of the theory, as they should linearize the symmetries of
the string action. a toy model world-sheet action using supertwistor variables was
suggested and its quantization resulted in the spectrum of states forming unitary
irreducible representations of su(2, 2|4). the connection of this supertwistor action
with linearly realized su(2, 2|4) to the gauge-xed string action with non-linearly
realized su(2, 2|4) was not clear however. progress was made in [2] where a twistor
parametrization of ads5 was found. the results were applied to a massive particle
propagating on ads5, and it was shown that the resulting action is a simple quantum
mechanical system with an u(1)su(2) gauge symmetry and a linear su(2, 2) global
symmetry. of course, the goal is eventually to use the results for a quantization
of strings on ads5  s5, thus solving a long-standing problem.
in this paper we
consider again the massive particle on ads5. already in the particle case the problems
analogous to those in string theory exist. we consider the action of [2] and argue by
counting of the number of degrees of freedom that quantum-mechanically the twistor
version is equivalent to the space-time version of the particle theory propagating
in ads5 space. we then nd a gauge leading to the action in a quadratic form and
perform its brst quantization, thus giving hope and further support for the program
of the quantization of the string.

the action of a massive particle propagating in ads5 space is proportional to the

invariant length of the world line

s = mz ds

where

 ds2 = dx mg mndxn = 2dx2 + r2   d
 !2

.

this action can also be presented in an equivalent form

s = z d (cid:20) p m x m 

e

2(cid:16) p mg mn pn + m2(cid:17)(cid:21)

and also in a clearly reparametrization invariant form:

s = z d "gg   x m xng mn 

g
2

m2# .

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

one can gauge-x the reparametrization symmetry but to the best of our understand-
ing, there is no clear way to make the action quadratic using any of these forms of
the classical action. the only exception is the massless case. note that the actions

1

(3) and (4) consistently contain the limit m  0, as opposed to (1). for m = 0, by
going to the conformally at metric of ads5, the factor g mn in (4) can be completely
absorbed into the worldline metric, and the action becomes quadratic upon gauge
xing the reparametrization symmetry. however, since the mass parameter prevents
us from doing the same successfully in the massive case, our strategy is to rst write
the classical lagrangian of a massive particle in ads5 using dierent eld variables.

a good candidate for a set of coordinates are twistors. these variables are well
dened in the context of the 4-dimensional space [3, 4] and realize the conformal
symmetry so(2, 4)  su(2, 2) linearly. since this is also the isometry group of ads5
(with 4d minkowski space as its boundary) it seemed natural to extend the twistor
construction to include the radial coordinate . this was achieved in [2]. for this
purpose two twistors

z i = (cid:18) i

 i(cid:19) .



(5)

with i = 1, 2 needed to be introduced instead of one. the space-time momenta p
are then replaced by the bilinears of the upper components of the twistors, 

i
p  = 2i


i
p = 

22 (cid:16)ij i

j

  c.c.(cid:17) .

(6)

the 5d space-time coordinates xm,  are encoded in the twistor construction through
the relation between the upper and lower twistor components:

 i = ix i

 +

 j

(7)

with 12 = 1. (7) automatically implies 3 real constraints the twistors have to satisfy:

where ij

i are the pauli matrices, and where

z i ij

a z j = 0 ,

z i = (z i)h,

with

h =(cid:18) 0

1

0(cid:19)

(8)

(9)

is the conjugate twistor.

this new twistor construction for ads5 was then applied [2] to the dynamics of a
massive particle propagating on this space. the action (3) in standard two-component
notation (see [2] for detailed conventions) is given by

s = z d " 1

p  x   p  

e

2r2   1

22 p p   2p 2

  m2r2!# .

(10)

using relations (6) and (7) one can rewrite the action (10) as follows

s = iz d z iz i 

e

2r2 (cid:20) 1

4

( z iijz j )2  (mr)2(cid:21) ,

(11)

where the twistor pair is subject to constraints (8). the reparametrization constraint,
the variation of the action over the worldline metric, implies a fourth constraint

1
2| z iijz j| = mr .

(12)

all four constraints are quadratic in the twistors, and the classical action can be
brought into the form [2]

scl = iz d (cid:16) z iz i  iuaa(cid:17) ,

where ua( ) are 4 lagrange multipliers to the 4 constraints

a = z itij

a z j  2a

0sr ,

tij

a =nij, (i)ijo

(13)

(14)

and s = m. note that there is an ambiguity in imposing the constraint 0. the
original particle action induces (12), hence 0 can be stated with 2mr. therefore,
we have the situation that two dierent twistor actions are equivalent to one particle
action. fortunately, we will also see that both twistor theories are related by a global
symmetry, and therefore equivalent.

this classical twistor lagrangian (13) is equivalent to the original classical particle
action in ads5 space since both theories result in the same classical equations of
motion. the twistor lagrangian has an u(1) su(2) gauge symmetry which acts on
the elds as

z i = ia( )tij
u0 =  0( ) ,
ui =  i( ) + 2ijkujk( ) ,

a z j ,

(15)

with local parameters a( ). also, the action has a global su(2, 2) symmetry since
any bilinear combination of twistors (or their space-time derivatives) of the form

z i(1)z j (2) = i(1)j

(2) + i

(1) j (2)

is invariant under the global su(2, 2)

where the transformations are those of the fundamental representation.

z i = gz i = (t)z i,

3

(16)

(17)

the 4 gauge symmetries of the action are consequences of the fact that the twistor
pair is subject to the four real rst class constraints. the canonical poisson brackets
[q, p]p.b. = 1 following from the twistor action (11) are

[z i

a, z j

b]p.b. = iij ab ,

[z i

a,z j

b]p.b. = [ z i

a, z j

b]p.b. = 0 ,

(18)

where a, b label the four twistor components ,  . with (18) it is easy to verify
that the constraints form an u(1)  su(2) algebra

[0, i]p.b. = 0 ,

[i, j]p.b. = 2ijkk .

(19)

at this point it is instructive to compare the degrees of freedom of (3) and (13). the
original space-time action had 5 degrees of freedom (x m, p m) and one gauge symmetry
(or one rst class constraint), leading to one pair of faddeev-popov ghosts. the net
number of physical degrees of freedom is 5  1 = 4. the twistor action has 8 degrees
of freedom z i, z i and 4 gauge symmetries (or 4 rst class constraints). this leads to
four pairs of faddeev-popov ghosts, and the net number of physical degrees of freedom
is 8  4 = 4. thus the total number of physical degrees of freedom in both action
coincides which provides an argument that they are equivalent quantum-mechanically.

the quantization can be performed both in the lagrangian form in the eld space,
as well as in canonical form. the rst one allows to nd a gauge in which the gauge-
xed action is quadratic, showing that the theory is free. the brst symmetry of
this action proves that the path integral is gauge-independent.

the operator form of the quantization in the canonical space has the advantage
that one can construct the brst operator so that the hamiltonian is given by the
commutator of the brst operator with the gauge fermion ,

h = [qbrst , ]  [h, qbrst ] = 0

(20)

and therefore the hamiltonian commutes with the brst operator by construction.
this leads to a simple denition of the physical states in terms of the oscillators of the
quantized theory. it is particularly important in our case to nd both, the generators
of the global su(2, 2) symmetry, as well as the brst operator which is the global
quantum counterpart of the u(1)  su(2) local gauge symmetry in terms of the free
oscillators of our theory. since the action (13) realizes the symmetry su(2, 2) linearly
we would expect that the states of the theory fall into su(2, 2) representations. in
[9, 10] these representations (more precisely, those of su(2, 2|4)) were constructed by
an oscillator method. we will later see that a subset of their representations built
the fock space of our theory.

in order for their construction to be valid in our quantum theory one has to verify
that all su(2, 2) generators commute with the brst operator qbrst . we will nd
that this is indeed the case.

4

as our theory has constraints, we will use diracs methods of quantization of
constrained systems [5]. these methods in the modern form in application to the
path integral were developed by fradkin and his collaborators [6] and by becchi,
rouet, stora and tyutin [7].

to proceed with the lagrangian brst quantization we add gauge xing condi-
tions through gauge functions a. for simplicity we take the a to be functions only
of the classical elds (lagrange multipliers and twistors), but not of their derivatives.
the gauge xed action is

lg.f.(cl, ba, ca, a) = lcl(cl) + q .

cl = {u,z, z}

where  is the gauge fermion of the form

 = baa(cl)

(21)

(22)

and the ba are anti-ghosts. the brst action on the elds of the classical action is
dened as follows. on the elds of the classical action it is given by eqs. (15) with
the parameter of the gauge transformation a( ) replaced by a product of the ghost
eld and a global anticommuting parameter . in addition we have to specify the
standard brst transformation on ghosts, anti-ghosts and multipliers to the gauge
xing condition a

brst cl = clcl(a( )  ca( )),
brst ba = a
1
brst ca = 
2
brst a = 0

f a
bccbcc

(23)

using the notation brst x = qx we can easily verify that q2 = 0. therefore, the
action above is brst invariant since the classical action is invariant under brst
transformations and the gauge xing term is invariant due to the nilpotency of q.

the brst invariant action in this class of gauges can be rewritten as

qlg.f. = qlcl + q2 = 0 .

lg.f. = lcl(cl) + aa(cl) + ba

a(cl)

cl

qcl .

(24)

(25)

the path integral is independent on the choice of the gauge-xing function a(cl).
with the simple choice

the action becomes

0 = u0  1

i = ui

lg.f. = i z i z i  u0( z iijz j  sr) + iui + 0(u0  1) + ba ca .

5

(26)

(27)

the cubic terms in the classical action and in the ghost action proportional to ui have
been absorbed by a redenition of i into i. the dependence of the classical action
on u0( ) is not absorbed into the redenition of 0. since this is a reparametrization
related symmetry, and u0 is related to e, it is not attractive to gauge away the
worldline metric, but rather to choose a gauge which sets u0( ) to a constant. the
last step is simply to integrate over i and 0, or equivalently to solve the equations
for these variables. the nal form of the gauge-xed action in this gauge is quadratic
in all elds

sg.f. = iz d z iz i  i( z iijz j  2sr) + iba ca .

(28)

this shows that the resulting theory is free and we may use oscillators to construct the
spectrum. the brst symmetry is inherited from the general case described above
since we have just taken a particular gauge and excluded the auxiliary elds. we may
also perform the quantization in the elegant and powerful formalism of batalin and
vilkovisky [8]. this can be found in the appendix. from (28) one again derives the
poisson brackets

[z i

a, z j

b]p.b. = iabij .

(29)
one might be tempted to identify z i ( z i) as creation (annihilation) operators, but
we will wait with the construction of states (i.e.
the denition of a vacuum and
creation and annihilation operators) until later. in fact, we will nd that there is a
more suitable choice.

let us rst construct the su(2, 2) generators explicitly in terms of the quan-
tized twistors. we start from the classical action (11) and will obtain the su(2,2)
generators by a noether procedure. the twistors transform in the fundamental rep-
resentation of su(2, 2) with z i = (t)z i. the fundamental of su(2, 2) is the
(chiral) spinor representation of so(4, 2) and the generators are the so(2, 4) gamma-
matrices, m mn = 1
4  mn. we choose mn = mn , ms = m5 , mt = m , t s = 5 ,
where the m, 5 are 5-dimensional gamma-matrices. the translation between the
spinor representation of so(2, 4) and the fundamental of su(2, 2) goes through the
unitary similarity matrix which relates the hermitian conjugate -matrices to the
original ones

the matrix a is identied with the su(2, 2) metric h and is given by

( mn) = a mna1 ,

a2 = 1 .

a = i0 .

(30)

(31)

it can be checked that in the twistor basis for the gamma-matrices [2] it gives the
metric as in (9). therefore the variation of the twistor, which is in the rst place an
so(2, 4)-spinor is

z i = 

1
4

 mn mnz i .

6

(32)

in general, the variation of the action is

s = z d ( )j

(33)

for local parameters . the j are the conserved currents (in this case, as we deal
with a quantum mechanical system, they are right away the charges). applying this
to the case at hand

(34)

(35)

s =

i

4z d (  mn) z i  mnz i .

we derive the su(2, 2) charges in terms of twistors

m mn =

i
4

z i  mnz i ,

these are the 15 hermitian generators of su(2, 2)  so(2, 4). the noether procedure
guarantees that they satisfy the algebra of poisson brackets. to elevate this to the
quantum theory, we promote the poisson brackets dened above to the commutators

[ z i
in terms of components the commutation relations are

b]p.b. = iabij

a, z j

[z i



a,z j

b] = abij ,

[i, j

] = 

ij ,

[i

, 

j ] =  

ij .

(36)

(37)

we will also have to deal with normal ordering ambiguities, but rst we would like to
give the explicit correspondence between this twistor construction and the oscillator
construction of [10].

to construct the fock space we have to identify the annihilation and creation
operators. we have found in (36) and (37) that one can view  and  as creation
operators, or any linear combination of the two (the same holds, of course, for the
annihilation operators). the commutation relations of our dynamical system are
closely related to those of the oscillator method used in [10] to construct the uirs
of su(2, 2). therefore, we would like to make use of the results obtained there.

the oscillator construction is built upon a set of creation (annihilation) operators
ar, br (ar, br) satisfying ar = (ar), br = (br). as the twistors as such do not satisfy
this condition a change of basis is required. thus, we obtain the following picture:

ads-spacetime = twistors
= z i = (cid:18) i

(xm, )

= oscillator construction
s ! .
i =   ari
bi



 i(cid:19) =

to explain the second part of this connection we make the change of basis explicit.
the change of basis between -matrices in the oscillator basis as in [10], denoted by

, and the twistor basis, denoted by , is given by the following unitary similarity
transformation

where

mn = s mns ,


s =

this induces the following rotation on the twistors

i = z i s .
now we identify the oscillators in the spinors  [10] as

i = sz i ,

i =   ari

(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)

as desired. in this basis the su(2, 2) metric h = a is given by diag(1, 1,1,1).
the global su(2, 2) generators are

m mn =

i

in the oscillator basis, and the gauge-xed action (28) reads

sg.f. = iz d i i  i(cid:16) iij j  2sr(cid:17) + iba ca .

(44)

(45)

now, that we have related the quantized twistors z i to the creation (ar, br) and
annihilation (ar, br) operators of [10] we have proven that the oscillator construction
of uir of su(2, 2) in [10] follows from the quantization of our action. before we
revisit this construction let us rst reexpress the su(2, 2) generators explicitly in the
a, b basis. since we want to dene them as quantum operators we have to tackle the
in the following the index m takes values {0, l, 5, 6},
problem of normal ordering.
where l = 1, 2, 3. we nd that the following generators build the su(2, 2) algebra on

(46)

the generators : ml5 + 1
2lmn mmn :, : m06 : generate the maximal
compact subgroup su(2)l  su(2)r  u(1)e, which provides the quantum numbers
of the states. the operator : m06 : corresponds to the ads energy and generates
translations along the global timelike vector eld of the ads5 space. in the conformal
interpretation it is the conformal hamiltonian, 1
2(p0 + r2k0). this generator is
the only global su(2, 2) generator which suers from a normal ordering ambiguity,
because of the tracelessness of the pauli matrices. this ambiguity can be resolved by
demanding that the su(2, 2) is a global symmetry of the quantum theory and since
we are dealing with a simple algebra (therefore every operator appears on the r.h.s. of
the algebra) the quantum operators are given necessarily by (46). these satisfy the
algebra of commutation relations

[ : m mn :, : mpq : ] = i( m[p : mq]n : n[p : mq] m :) .

for convenience, we introduce the number operators

is quantized in units of r1.

the fock space of (zero ghost number) states is constructed as in [10] with just

two generations of oscillators. the vacuum is dened by

ar|0i = br|0i = 0 .

(50)

the lowest weight type representations (lwtr) are then constructed by selecting a
lowest weight vector (lwv) |i annihilated by all su(2, 2) generators of the form

rs  (ar)i(bs)i .
l

(51)

the lwv transforms irreducibly under the maximal compact subgroup s(u(2)u(2)),
l0  (ar)i(as)i  (br)i(bs)i, and the representations are then constructed by the
repeated action of
(52)

l+rs  (ar)i(bs)i

on |i, i.e. the representations are of the form

|i, l+|i, l+l+|i, l+l+l+|i, ..

(53)

finally, let us proceed with the hamiltonian quantization. the physical states of
the theory can now be constructed using the brst operator. as usual, for the rst
class constraints [a, b] = f c
abcacbbc, which in our
case becomes

abc one denes qbrst = caa  1
qbrst = caa + iijkcicjbk .

2f c

(54)

it is easily veried that one has indeed q2
brst = 0. there are no normal ordering
issues, since the only expression which could lead to such ambiguities, 0, drops out
out of the calculation of q2

brst .

the physical states |i of the theory must also be constructed in a way that
respects the global symmetry of our action. fortunately, by construction, our brst
operator commutes with the generators of the global su(2, 2), because the constraints
in qbrst contain the twistors only in the su(2, 2) invariant bilinear form of (16).
therefore, the construction of representations above is consistent with the brst
condition on physical states |i given by
qbrst|i = 0

|i 6= qbrst| i

(55)

as usual, we will focus here on the states with vanishing ghost number

qbrst|ingh=0 = caa|ingh=0 = 0,

(56)

which are by construction annihilated by the (normal ordered) brst constraints
: 0 : = : z iz i  2sr : = : ii  2sr : = (na  nb + 4  2(s + s0)r) ,
: i : = : z i(i)ijz j : = : i(i)ij j : = arj ai

r(i)ij  bribj

r (i)ij

(57)

in the su(2) constraints : i : there is no normal ordering constant, because the pauli
matrices are traceless. the nonvanishing commutators of above constraints are

[: i :, : j :] = 2iijk : k : .

(58)

however, : 0 : has a normal ordering ambiguity expressed in the new parameter s0.
this ambiguity can neither be resolved by requiring nilpotency of the brst operator,
nor closure of the algebra. hence, the theory seems to be consistent for all choices of
s0.

10

however the classical twistor action (11) and the gauge-xed actions (28) and (45)

are cpt invariant1 for the transformations

i cpt 

5(i) ,

=

a

cpt b ,

b

cpt a ,

since i is a dirac spinor, and



cpt  ,

ca cpt ca ,

ba

cpt ba

and s

cpt s .

(59)

(60)

we see that under a cpt transformation the parameter s necessarily changes sign.
if we want to extend this symmetry to a quantum symmetry and construct a cpt
invariant spectrum we need that the constraints transform into themselves under
cpt  : 0 :.
this cpt. this leads us to s0 = 2 as then under cpt the constraint : 0 :
this constraint then gives that on physical states

z  sr =

1
2

(na  nb) .

(61)

since this generator commutes with all su(2, 2) generators all states of a given rep-
resentation carry the same eigenvalue of z. in the full supersymmetric case a u(1)
operator (central charge) does appear in the r.h.s. of the superconformal algebra [10],
which takes in the bosonic case precisely the form of z. this suggests that in fact the
mass mr is to be identied with the modulus of the central charge in the supercon-
formal theory. however, a full clarication of this point requires a supersymmetric
generalization of this work.

now, let us discuss the representations of the theory which form the physical
states. we will not attempt a full classication in this publication, rather have a rst
glance at the problem. we analyze the representations of [10] with two generations of
oscillators and check whether they are admitted by the brst constraints (i.e. su(2)
invariance).

the rst state allowed (with the choice s0 = 2) is the vacuum state

|i = |0i .

(62)

the corresponding multiplet arises from the massless (super)particle and gives rise
(in the supersymmetric case) to the supergravity multiplet of n = 8 supergravity.

generically, su(2, 2) representations with lwv

|i = ar1i1ar2i2...arnin|0i ,

(63)

are not annihilated by the brst operator, and therefore not physical states of our
theory.

1we mean cpt invariance in the 4-dimensional sense as in [10].

11

to construct admissible representations is rather simple, as we only need to use
su(2) representation theory (where the su(2) is part of the brst symmetry and
not be confused with any su(2, 2) subgroup). the oscillators transform in the fun-

representing the lwv

these are the multiplets which in the supersymmetric case were called in [10] novel
short multiplets. the lwv of the cpt conjugate multiplets [10], obtained by re-
placing a with b oscillators, have the same ads5 energy, but z = j.

above we gave examples of su(2, 2) uirs which are physical states of the theory,
and of uirs which are not. a complete study of the admitted states remains to be
done.

in conclusion, we have quantized the dynamics of a massive particle propagating
on ads5. we applied the brst quantization formalism to the action following from
the twistor parametrization of ads5. the action turned out to be free and we specied
the fock space of the theory. we found that the states fall into su(2, 2) representa-
tions with integral value of the central charge z, corresponding to the mass of the
particle. they correspond to the bosonic part of the novel short supermultiplets [10]
of states on ads5.

given the success of twistor variables in the particle case we hope that the pro-
cedure can be generalized and may help also in the quantization of the string on
ads5.

bv quantization of the particle on ads5 in a nutshell

in the bv method [8] we introduce for every eld (including the ghosts) an antield
with opposite statistics. the space of elds and antields are called the fields. we de-
note them generically with  = {a, 
a}. the antields are assigned a ghostnumber
gh() such that
(68)

gh(a) + gh(

a) = 1 .

the various elds of our model are given in table 1.

table 1: the bv fields of the model

one introduces the antibracket of two functions of the fields f, g

(f, g) =

(69)

in the summation over a also an integration over  is understood. the extended
action for the model is

sext = i z iz i  ua( z itij

a( ca + 2ijkujcki

and is obtained by requiring the classical master equation

(sext, sext) = 0 .

the space of physical observables is dened through the antibracket cohomology. we
have the nilpotent (through jacobi-identities and (71)) operator

sf = (f, s) .

(72)

the physical observables are functions of the elds of ghostnumber 0 and two functions
describe the same physical observable if they are in the same cohomology class. we
dene canonicle transformations as transformations which preserve the antibracket.
it is then clear that this does not aect the physical observables. it turns out that
gauge-xing can be performed by a canonical transformation. in our case we take the
transformation

u
a = ba ,

ua = 0

a  ba ,

(73)

provides an appropriate gauge-xing. what it means is that we choose a dierent
subset in the space of fields of what we call elds. indeed, we consider u
a as a eld
and give it the name ba. it has ghostnumber 1 hence its usual name antighost. the
gauge-xed action gets the form

sg.f. = i z i z i  ( z iz i  2mr) + ba ca

(74)

the antield-independent part of this action coincides with action (28). the brst
operator  is identied through

f () = (f (), s)|=0 .
