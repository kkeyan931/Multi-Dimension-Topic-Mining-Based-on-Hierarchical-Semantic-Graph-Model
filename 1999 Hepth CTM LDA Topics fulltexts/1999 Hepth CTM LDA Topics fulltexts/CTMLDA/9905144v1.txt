abstract

we propose a method to obtain a manifestly supersymmetric action functional for interacting brane
systems. it is based on the induced map of the worldvolume of low-dimensional branes into the worldvol-
ume of the space-time lling brane ((d-1)-brane), which may be either dynamical or auxiliary, and implies
an identication of grassmann coordinate elds of lower dimensional branes with an image of the grass-
mann coordinate elds of that (d-1)-brane. with this identication the covariant current distribution
forms with support on the superbrane worldvolumes become invariant under the target space supersym-
metry and can be used to write the coupled superbrane action as an integral over the d-dimensional
manifolds ((d-1)-brane worldvolume). we compare the equations derived from this new (goldstone
fermion embedded) action with the ones produced by a more straightforward generalization of the free
brane actions based on the incorporation of the boundary terms with lagrange multipliers (superspace
embedded action). we nd that both procedures produce the same equations of motion and thus justify
each other. both actions are presented explicitly for the coupled system of a d = 10 super-d3-brane and
a fundamental superstring which ends on the super-d3-brane.

introduction

intensive studies of interacting branes (intersecting branes and branes ending on branes) [1][6]
were performed for the pure bosonic limit [7, 1, 3] or in the framework of the probe brane
approach [2, 5].
in spite of many successes achieved in this way, it is desirable to obtain a
complete and manifestly supersymmetric description of the interacting brane systems at the
level of (quasi)classical eective action.

actually, the preservation of symmetries in the presence of boundaries (including the bound-
aries of open branes ending on other branes) requires a consideration of anomalies [10, 2], while
at the classical level the boundary breaks at least half of the supersymmetry [11, 12, 2] (see
appendix a). so at that level one may search for an action for a coupled brane system, which
includes manifestly supersymmetric bulk terms for all the branes and allows direct variations.

in this paper we propose a procedure to obtain such a supersymmetric action for an interact-
ing brane system. it involves a (dynamical or auxiliary) space-time lling brane ((d-1)-brane
dominance) and uses the identication of all the grassmann coordinate elds of lower dimen-
sional branes () with images of the (d-1)-brane grassmann coordinate elds () = (x()).
in this sense intersecting branes are considered as embedded into the goldstone fermion theory
[8] (which is just the space-time lling superbrane [9]) rather then into superspace. as a result
we obtain less fermionic equations than expected. the equations can be split in separate ones
for the open brane and the host brane, but with an indenite source localized at the intersection.
to justify the above result we turn to a more straightforward generalization of the free
superbrane actions to the coupled brane system. it produces the necessary identication of the
supercoordinate function at the intersection by an incorporation of a bosonic vector 1-form and
a grassmann spinor 1-form lagrange multipliers into the boundary term. (to our knowledge
such a quite simple action was not considered before). we nd that the lagrange multipliers
involve an ambiguity in the equations of motion. due to that ambiguity the equations of motion
obtained from those (superspace embedded or sspe) action and ones derived from the above
mentioned (goldstone fermion embedded or gfe) action functional turns out to be equivalent.
thus the two approaches justify each other.

we nd that an ambiguity in the sources localized at the intersection appears in the bosonic
coordinate equations as well and, thus, have to be taken into account even in the pure bosonic
limit of the coupled brane system.

we present an explicit form of both sspe and gfe actions for the system of the closed
super-d3-brane and the fundamental superstring ending on the super-d3-brane 1. the latter is
of particular interest for string/m-theory [14], its applications to gauge theory [15], as well as
in the frame of the maldacena conjecture [16]. to be concrete, we describe our approach just
for this specic system.

1 an action with lagrange multipliers

the actions of a free type iib superstring and a free super-d3-brane can be presented as
integrals of a lagrangian 2form liib

and 4-form ld3

over the the worldsheet m1+1 = () = (, ) and the d3-brane worldvolume m1+3 =  m
(m = 0, . . . , 3). they should be regarded as surfaces embedded into the d = 10 type iib

1 this system is a special one for string perturbation theory. here d-branes are considered as (sub)manifolds
where the open string endpoints live upon and can be described by open string states (see [12] and refs. therein).
however, for the description in the language of brane eective action functionals, which is considered here, this
system provides a quite generic example of interacting branes (brane democracy [13]).

superspace m(1+9|32)

m(1+9|32) = {x m, 1, 2} = {x m, i },

m = 0, . . . , 9,  = 1, . . . , 16,

i = 1, 2,

(2)

m1+1  m(1+9|32) : x m = x m(), i = i(),
m1+3  m(1+9|32) : x m = x m( m), i = i( m).

the action for the interacting system is expected to be

s = zm1+1

a,

(3)

(4)

(5)

where the last term [2, 5] describes the interaction of the string endpoints with the gauge
eld a = dxmam(x) of the super-d3-brane [17]. however, the action (5) immediately poses
a problem. its origin is the sum of integrals over dierent manifolds, which could have some
nontrivial intersections, e.g.

m1+1  m1+3

 m1+3  m1+1 = m1+1.

(6)

the intersection manifold m1+1 for the superstring(s)superd3brane system is a set
of worldlines which may be numbered by a label j (connected components of the superstring
worldsheet boundary). for the case of one open superstring ending on the d3brane j = 1, 2.
each worldline can be parametrized by the proper time j. thus the manifold m1+1 can be
dened parametrically as a submanifold of the worldsheet m1+1

m1+1  m1+1 :

 = (j),

and as a submanifold of the worldvolume m1+3

m1+1  m1+3 :

 m =  m(j).

(7)

(8)

in the following, for simplicity, we skip the index j. the bosonic and fermionic coordinate
functions (3), (4) which dene the embeddings of the worldsheet and the worldvolume into the
target superspace should have the same image on m1+1 (i.e. should coincide when restricted
to m1+1)

x m (( )) = x m ( m( ))  x

m

( ),

i (( )) = i ( m( ))  

i

( ).

(9)

the above mentioned problem with the action (5) appears because, due to the identica-
tion (9), the variations  x m () ,  i () and  x m ( m) ,  i ( m) may not be regarded as
completely independent ones.

the straightforward way to take eqs. (9) into account is to incorporate them into the action
(5) by means of a bosonic and a fermionic lagrangian multiplier 1-form p 1m = d p  m and
1 = d  

ss = zm1+1

however, as we will see below, these lagrange multipliers cannot be determined from the equa-
tions of motion. because, in addition, their nature may seem unclear, doubts could arise whether
the lagrange multiplier method is applicable at all here. an example of a system where this
method indeed fails is provided by self-dual gauge elds, whose covariant description at the level
of the action functional required the development of a special (pst) approach [18].

2

thus to justify the applicability of the action (10) it is useful to describe the interacting

branes in a dierent manner.

in fact, in order to be able to vary the action (5) directly, one could try (instead of using
lagrange multipliers (10)) to nd a supersymmetric way to write all the terms as integrals over
a manifold containing both the super-d3-brane worldvolume and the superstring worldsheet.

it turns out that this is indeed possible. moreover, the dynamical system then may be

extended possibly by inclusion of an action for supergravity.

2 space-time lling branes and induced embeddings

we nd it useful to rst extend our system by inclusion of the super-d9-brane, which is a
space-time lling brane of the d = 10 type iib superspace

s = zm1+9

l10 + zm1+1

2 +zm1+3
liib

4 + zm1+1
ld3

a.

(11)

here l10 is the super-d9-brane lagrangian form (see e.g.
[19]). the essential point is that
the super-d9-brane implies the existence of the map of a d = 10 dimensional bosonic surface
m1+9 = {x m} ( m = 0, . . . , 9) into type iib superspace

m1+9  m(1+9|32) : x m = x m(x m), i = i(x m),

(12)

with an invertible function x m = x m(x m). this allows the denition of an induced embedding
of the superstring worldsheet and the super-d3-brane worldvolume into the bosonic surface
m1+9 (d9-brane worldvolume)

x m = x m()  x m() = x m (cid:0)x m()(cid:1) ,
x m = x m()  x m() = x m(cid:0)x m()(cid:1) ,

x m() = x m (cid:0)x m()(cid:1) ,

x m() = x m(cid:0)x m()(cid:1) ,

i() = i(cid:0)x m()(cid:1) ,
i( m) = i(cid:0)x m()(cid:1) .

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

and to consider the superstring and super-d3-brane coordinate functions as images of the func-
tions dened on m1+9 on the worldsheet and on the worldvolume, respectively:

actually, what we need are the induced embeddings (15), (16). below we will treat the
9-brane as auxiliary and drop the lagrangian l10 altogether. the study of the interaction of
the fundamental string with this super-d9-brane in the framework of the present approach is
the subject of another paper [20].

an interesting alternative for future study would be to consider l10 in (11) as a lagrangian
form of a counterpart of the group manifold action [21] for d = 10 type iib supergravity, which
assumes the map (12) as well. this provides the possibility to generalize our consideration for
the case of curved superspace. thus the construction of such group manifold action for type
iib supergravity on the basis of the pst action [22] seems to be another promising problem,
which we however do not address here.

3 current form distributions and supersymmetry

3.1 covariant current distribution forms

to write the action for the coupled system (11) in a unique form, let us dene rst the 10-
dimensional manifestly covariant current densities with support on the superstring worldsheet

3

and on the super-d3-brane worldvolume respectively (see [23] for the bosonic m2-brane and
m5-brane [24] interacting with d=11 supergravity)

j8 = (dx)8

l4 =

dx m1()  . . .  dx m4()l m4... m1(x

(22)

are their pull-backs onto the worldsheet and the worldvolume, respectively.

3.2 brane boundary and current (non)conservation

if we assume that the worldvolume of a brane, say super-d3-brane, is closed m1+3 = 0, then
the brane current j m1... m4 (18) is conserved,  m4 j m1... m4 = 0, and thus the current density form
j6 (18) is a closed form dj6 = 0.

this is not true for open branes. here we are interested in the open superstring case m1+1 =
{ } 6= 0. substituting the closed two form, say da, instead of l2 into (20) and using stokes
theorem one arrives at

zm1+1

a = zm1+1

da = zm1+9

j8  da = zm1+9

dj8  a.

(23)

eq. (23) demonstrates that the form dj8 has a support localized at the boundary of the world-
sheet, i.e. on the worldline of the string endpoints parametrized by the proper time  . this
again can be justied by an explicit calculation with eqs. (17), which results in

dj8 = (dx)9

n zm1+1

dxn( )10 (x  x( )) .

(24)

for the description of the above situation it is useful to introduce also superstring and super-
d3-brane current form distributions j1 and j3 with support on the boundary of the superstring
worldsheet (6)

j1 = d zm1+1
j3 = d 3

m zm1+1

d ( )2 (cid:16)  ( )(cid:17) ,

 = (, )

d m( )4 (cid:16)  ( )(cid:17) ,

 m = ( 0, . . . ,  3)

with the properties

zm1+1

j1  a = zm1+1

a,

zm1+3

j3  a = zm1+1

a.

(25)

(26)

(27)

collecting eqs. (27) and (24)

zm1+1

d a = zm1+9

dj8  a = zm1+3

j3  a = zm1+1

j1  a

one can write down formal relations between current distribution forms

dj8 = j1  j8 = j3  j6

(28)

(29)

here formal extrapolations of the relations (20) to arbitrary worldvolume forms have been used.
eq. (29) represents in a compact and transparent manner the nonconservation of the super-
string current form due to the presence of the worldsheet boundary. let us stress, however, that
it is really true in the sense of the integrated equations (28) with a test 1-form a.

3.3 supersymmetric invariance of distribution forms

performing a general coordinate transformation, the current densities can be expressed in terms
of the coordinate elds x m as, e.g.

j8 = (dx)8

nmj nm(x) = (dx)8

nmzm1+1

d x m()  d x n()10 (cid:16)x  x()(cid:17) .

(30)

in (30) one recognizes the current densities used for the description of intersection of the bosonic
it does not include the grassmann coordinate elds i , i and this may lead
branes [23].
to a doubts concerning its invariance under supersymmetry, which, however, holds after the
identication (15), (16), as will be seen below.

the variation of the form (30) can be written as

j8 = 3(dx)8

[mnk]zm1+1

d x m()  d x n()(cid:16)x k   x k()(cid:17) 10 (cid:16)x  x()(cid:17) 

(31)

2(dx)8

mn zm1+1

d x m( )(cid:16)x n   x n( )(cid:17) 10 (cid:16)x  x( )(cid:17) .

the target superspace supersymmetry transformations

x m = i mi ,

i = i

imply the transformations of the superstring coordinate elds

 x m() = i()mi,

 i() = i,

and the ones of the (auxiliary) 9-brane

x m(x) = i(x)mi,

i(x) = i.

(32)

(33)

(34)

in the parametrization of the 9-brane worldvolume by x m coordinates, which is possible due
to the invertibility (12) of the embedding function x(x), the transformation (34) coincides with
the goldstone fermion realization [8] of the type iib supersymmetry

x m = i (x)mi ,

i(x)  i (x )  i(x) = i.

(35)

the variation of the current form (30) under the transformations (33) (cf. (31)) becomes

j8 = 3(dx)8

[mnk]zm1+1

d x m()  d x n()(cid:16)i(x)  i ()(cid:17) ki 10(cid:16)x  x()(cid:17)  (36)

5

2(dx)8

mnzm1+1

d x m( )(cid:16)i (x)  i ( )(cid:17) ni 10 (cid:16)x  x( )(cid:17) .

the key observation is that if one identies the grassmann coordinates elds of the lower
dimensional branes i (), i() with the images of the 9-brane grassmann coordinate elds on
the worldvolumes (goldstone fermions [8]) i (x)

i () = i (cid:16) x()(cid:17) ,

i () = i (cid:16) x()(cid:17)

(37)

one nds that the current forms j8 and j6 are supersymmetric invariant!

such an invariance is quite evident in the representation (17), (18), as the coordinates xn

(12) are inert under the target space supersymmetry. the identication (37) (see (13), (14))

i () = i (x()) ,

i () = i (x())

(38)

is implied here by the assumption that it is possibile to lift the complete superbrane actions to
the 10-dimensional integral form using the relations (20). the manifestly supersymmetric form
of the current densities appears after passing to the supersymmetric basis of the space tangent
to m1+9

m = dxm m

m = dx m  idi mi ,

4 lagrangian forms and action for the interacting system

thus, if we assume that the lagrangian form for superstring liib
can
be presented as the pull-back of some 10-dimensional 2-form and 4-form living on the bosonic
surface m1+9 (see (21), (22)), we can write the action for the coupled system (5) in a way which
allows direct variation

(48)

while b2, entering (43), (46), is the ns-ns gauge eld, whose at superspace value is

b2 = im  (cid:16)d1m1  d2m2(cid:17) + d1m1  d2m2

h3 = db2 = im  (cid:16)d1m  d1  d2m  d2(cid:17) .

(49)

(50)

one can actually consider the action (42) with lagrangian form (43), (44), extending formally
the relations (20) to arbitrary forms on the worldsheet and worldvolume respectively. however,
a more rigorous procedure (which actually could motivate formal manipulations of this type
also in another context) consists in searching for an equivalent representation of the superstring
and superbrane actions, whose lagrangian form can be considered as a pullback of the 10-
dimensional forms. fortunately such actions do exist. they were proposed in the frame of
the lorentz harmonic approach for superstrings [25] (see also [28, 29, 31]) and super-dp-branes
[26, 31, 19] respectively.

thus in the lorentz harmonic approach the action (42) of the interacting system of the

super-d3-brane and the fundamental superstring ending on the superd3brane becomes

5 properties of the equations of motion for coupled branes

our study so far relies on the embedding of the branes into the goldstone fermion theory
(dynamical or auxiliary (d-1)brane) rather than into the superspace. thus we clearly have less
fermionic equations for the coupled branes than can be expected. nevertheless, as we will see,
this is not a drawback of just the gfe action (42), (51), as the equations obtained from the
sspe action (10) are actually equivalent.

for the sspe action (10) we have twice as many fermionic variables as in the case above.
however it includes the lagrange multiplier 1-forms p1, 1 which remain indenite and appear
in the equations of motion just inside a source localized at the intersection. as we clarify below,

7

these equations with indenite source are equivalent to the fermionic equations following from
the gfe action.

we rst consider the sspe action (10) with

(55)

(56)

[29, 26] (see (51)(54)). to obtain the simplest form of the equations of motion it is convenient to
pass from the holonomic basis in the space of variations x, i , a, . . . to the supersymmetric
one (cf. (39), (46), (49), (52), (53), (54))

written in terms of dierential forms [28, 26, 31, 19] (we will not need their explicit expressions
below), while m 1m denotes the coordinate variation localized at the boundary, which appears
due to the integration by part in the bulk superstring action (1). we should stress that in
the basis (57) no boundary input with the variation i appears (see appendix a, and [20] for
details). note also that we use the lorentz harmonic formulations of superstring and super-
d3-brane [25, 28, 31] as here the free equations of motion appear in the form which allows a
lifting to the 10-dimensional space, while the standard formulations (43)(50) can be considered
in such a way only formally.

for the coupled system one can expect some set of equations with sources localized at the

intersection instead of (60), (61).

include a source localized at the boundary and expressed through the the lagrange multiplier
1-forms by (59). this source is indenite, as the lagrange multipliers are not determined by
the equations of motion.

in the above notations the variation of the gfe action (42), (51) with respect to coordinate

elds x m(x) and i(x) reads as

only one set of independent fermionic variations i(x) is included into (63) and, thus, the

however, as the only intersection of the worldsheet with the super-d-brane worldvolume is
assumed to be just the boundary of the worldsheet m1+3  m1+1 = m1+1 (6), eq.
(64)
allows the statement that the pair of the fermionic equations (62) with indenite source 1
appears. thus both methods of the description of the interacting superbranes produce equiva-
lent fermionic equations with an indenite source localized at the intersection. actually some
restrictions for the sources can be obtained using the explicit expressions for the l.h.s.-s of the
fermionic equations [20], but an ambiguity remains.

note that a similar ambiguity appears in the bosonic equations and, thus, cannot be removed

by passing to the pure bosonic limit. indeed, in accordance with (58) the bosonic equations

m2m = j1  m 1m  j1  p1m,

m4m = j3  p1m

(65)

involve an indenite lagrange multiplier 1-form p1m. the choice p1m = 0 corresponds to a
sourceless equation for the host brane, which is the super-d3-brane in our case. note that
a denite source localized at the intersection is present in the supersymmetrized born-infeld
equations, i.e. in the gauge eld equations for the host brane.

conclusion and outlook

in this note we propose two ways to obtain a supersymmetric action for interacting superbrane
systems and present an explicit form of the actions for an open superstring ending on a super-
d3-brane: (10), (55), (56) and (42), (51). they allow to obtain a manifestly supersymmetric (see
appendix a) set of equations of motion by straightforward variation. one of the actions (10)
uses the lagrange multiplier method to incorporate the necessary identication of the coordinate
elds at the intersection, while the other ((42), (51)) implies an identication of the grassmann
coordinate of intersecting branes with an image of the d(= 10)dimensional goldstone fermion
eld. thus such an action actually assumes the presence of an auxiliary or dynamical space-
time lling brane and, hence, can be called (d-1)-brane dominance model. an action for the
space-time lling brane (in our case super-d9-brane) can be easily included in the action for an
interacting low dimensional brane system like (11). on the other hand, it opens the possibility
to include the supergravity into the coupled brane system: in a complete action for a coupled
brane system like (11) the group-manifold action for d-dimensional supergravity may replace
the free action for the dynamical space-time lling brane.

inclusion of the (auxiliary or dynamical) space-time lling brane or of supergravity requires
the use of the moving frame (lorentz harmonic) actions [25, 28, 29, 31] for low dimensional
open branes and host branes. the reason is that their lagrangian forms (in distinction to the
ones of the standard actions) can be regarded as pullbacks of some d-dimensional dierential

9

(p+1)forms and, thus, the moving frame actions for free branes can be written easily in the
form of integrals over a ddimensional manifold by means of the current densities presented here
(see [23] for bosonic branes). just the existence of the moving frame formulation may motivate
the formal lifting of the lagrangian forms of the standard actions to d dimensions and their use
for the description of the interaction with spacetime lling branes and/or supergravity.

we studied the general structure of the equations of motion and found that for both ap-
proaches we arrive at an ambiguity in the source terms, which can be xed only partially. such
an ambiguity actually appears as a result of the identication of the coordinate elds of the open
brane and the host brane at the intersection. it is inherent not only for the supersymmetric
case, but for the pure bosonic limit of intersecting branes as well.

the explicit form of the equations of motion, the analysis of their properties and the study
of symmetry and supersymmetry issues for the action of interacting superbranes will be the
subject of a forthcoming paper [20].

appendix a: on boundaries and supersymmetry

our aim was to nd the action which includes manifestly (n = 2, d = 10) supersymmetric
bulk terms, allows direct variations and, hence, leads to equations of motion with manifestly
supersymmetric l.h.s.-s. as it is well known, the presence of a boundary breaks the (n = 2)
supersymmetry of the classical action. for our system in the lorentz harmonic formulation (10),
(55), (56), (52), (54) the relevant boundary variation has the form

(s)boundary = zm1+1 (cid:18) 1

where we use the basis (57) and put i(f  f )  a  b2 + ebfbaiea = 0, which corresponds,
in particular to the supersymmetry transformations of the gauge eld a (see [17]) which is
chosen to make the superd3brane action supersymmetric. as mentioned in section 5, no
boundary input with the variation i appears. this does not contradict the wellknown fact
that the presence of a worldsheet boundary breaks at least a half of the target space n = 2

nonvanishing and has the form

im = 2x m = 2i mi .

(a.2)

imposing the boundary conditions 1(( )) = 2(( )) one arrives at the conservation of
n = 1 supersymmetry whose embedding into the type iib supersymmetry group is dened
by 1 = 2. actually these conditions provide i m(( )) = 0 and, as a consequence, the
vanishing of the variation (a.1).

the above consideration in the frame of the lorentz harmonic approach results in an in-
teresting observation that the supersymmetry breaking by boundary is related to the classical

reparametrization anomaly: indeed the variation (a.1), which produces the nonvanishing vari-
ation under n = 2 supersymmetry transformation with (a.2), contains only the variations

m , which correspond to reparametrization gauge symmetry of the free
superstring and free superd3brane, respectively.

there exists a straightforward way to keep half of the rigid target space supersymmetry
of the superstringsuper-dp-brane system by incorporation of the additional boundary term

involves an additional arbitrariness in the rst set of the fermionic equations (62), which now
1 + (1)i 1(cid:17). however, following [2, 5], we accept in this paper the soft
read i
breaking of the supersymmetry by boundaries at the classical level (see [10, 2] for symmetry
restoration by anomalies). we expect that the bps states preserving part of the target space
supersymmetry will appear as particular solutions of the coupled superbrane equations following
from our actions.

the current form (b.1) is invariant under the at target space supersymmetry (32) without the
identication (15), but assumes, nevertheless the presence of a space-time lling brane. however,
an evident problem following this direction is the lack of a curved superspace generalization of
the supersymmetric interval (b.2).
