we study an abelian chernsimons & fermion system in three dimensions. in the pres-
ence of a xed prescribed background magnetic eld we nd an innite number of fully
three-dimensional solutions. these solutions are related to hopf maps and are, therefore,
labelled by the hopf index. further we discuss the interpretation of the background eld.

1 introduction

it is the purpose of this letter to construct an innite number of fully three-dimensional
solutions to a chernsimons & fermion system that are labelled by the hopf index,
thereby merging two features  chernsimons theory and hopf maps  that have recently
received wide attention within quantum eld theory.

on the one hand, hopf maps are just maps s3  s2. these maps fall into dierent
homotopy classes that are labelled by the integers (the hopf index, see below for details).
field congurations with nontrivial hopf index have already been studied for some time
in uid dynamics [1], in astrophysics [2], in magnetic solids (magnetic solitons, see e.g.,
[3]) and in classical electro-magnetism [4]. recently, there has been a lot of interest in
eld theories where static solutions with nontrivial hopf index (hopf solitons) occur (see
e.g., [5][10]).

on the other hand, chernsimons theories with matter and/or a maxwell term have
been studied intensively since their introduction [11]. when an abelian chernsimons
term in three dimensions is coupled to matter, the magnetic eld is forced to be propor-
tional to the electric current due to the equations of motion [12][16]. further, in these
models there exist soliton-like, static (i.e., two-dimensional) solutions that are related to
some topological invariants (e.g., maps s2  s2) [12][16]. usually, these solitons be-
have like vortices, and, because of their topological nature, they exhibit magnetic ux
quantization. therefore these solutions are physically relevant in situations where the
phenomenon of magnetic ux quantization occurs and where matter is conned to a
plane, the most prominent example being the quantum hall eect [17, 18].

at this point the question arises whether there exist fully three-dimensional solutions
for such chernsimons & matter systems, and whether these solutions may be charac-
terized by some topological invariants, as well.

in this letter we shall demonstrate that, if the presence of a xed, prescribed back-
ground magnetic eld is assumed, then there indeed exist solutions to the chernsimons
& fermion system dened below. further, these solutions are related to hopf maps and
are, therefore, labelled by the hopf index. however, for the existence of these solutions
the presence of the background eld is crucial. (it should be mentioned at this point that
two-dimensional, solitonic solutions in the presence of a background eld have already
been studied in the past. there it was observed that the background eld may allow for
new, interesting solutions, see e.g. [19].)

in the main section of this letter we dene the model and construct solutions to its
equations of motion, as well as the hopf maps that provide these solutions. in the nal
section we give two possible interpretations for the background eld that is present in
our solutions.

finally, a word on the name: as we start with a three-dimensional, euclidean action,
we call our solutions hopf instantons. however, it may be equally interesting to interpret
them as static congurations in three spatial dimensions. in this second interpretation
they could be relevant in situations where topologically nontrivial, fully three-dimensional
magnetic eld congurations (magnetic knots or magnetic solitons) may occur.

2 construction of the hopf instantons

we start with the action (i, j, k = 1 . . . 3)

s =z d3x(cid:16)(ij  aj)j +

~a ~b(cid:17)

(1)

where  is a two-component spinor (fermion), j are the pauli matrices and ~a is an
abelian gauge potential. further,

scs =

2z d3x ~a ~b =

4z d3xijkaifjk

(2)

is the chernsimons (cs) action, where the chernsimons coupling constant is chosen
equal to one; and

where the background gauge eld ab

ai = ai + ab

i and its magnetic eld bb

i = ijkjab

k are

~ab = 

1

1 + r2

~n ,

~bb =

(1 + r2)2

~n

and we have introduced the unit vector

~n =

(10)

( ~n 2 = 1) for later convenience. observe that the (xed, non-dynamical) background eld
is coupled to the fermion, but it is absent in the cs term. the equations of motion
resulting from the action (1) are

(ij  aj)j = 0,

(6)

(the dirac equation) and

(7)
observe that for any pair (, aj) that solves the dirac equation (6) the spin density ~
related to  has to obey

~ := ~ = ~b.

~~ = 0,

therefore, equations (6) and (7) are consistent.

the simplest solution to this system is (see [20, 21])

~n

(11)

( ~n is given in (5)). here the dynamical gauge eld is proportional to the background eld,
therefore one could nd a solution without background eld by choosing either a dierent
normalization of the fermion (9) or by choosing a chernsimons coupling constant in (2),
(7) dierent from 1. however, this will not be true for the solutions below, for which the
background eld (4) is crucial.

concerning the geometrical behaviour of the magnetic eld ~b in (11), it is important
to note that it is related to a hopf map, and, therefore, the value of the cs action (2) is
topologically quantized by the hopf index. this we want to explain now.

generally, a complex function  : r3  c with the additional property limr  =
0 = const. denes a hopf map  : s3  s2, where the coordinates in r3 and c are
stereographic coordinates of the s3 and s2, respectively. the pre-images in r3 of points
 = const. are closed curves in r3 (circles in s3), and any two dierent circles are linked
exactly n times, where n is the hopf index. further, a magnetic eld ~b (the hopf
curvature) is related to the hopf map  via

~b =

(~ )  (~)
(1 + )2 = 4

s(~s)  ~
(1 + s2)2

2
i

(12)

mathematically, the curvature f = 1

where  = sei is expressed in terms of its modulus s and phase  at the r.h.s. of (12).
2fijdxidxj, fij = ijkbk, is the pullback under
the hopf map, f = , of the standard area two-form  on the target s2 with radius
1 (in stereographic coordinates) [4, 5, 8],

 

2
i

dzdz

(1 + zz)2 .

(13)

geometrically, ~b is tangent to the closed curves  = const. the hopf index n of  may
be computed from ~b via

where ~b = ~  ~a.

the simplest (standard) hopf map (1) with hopf index n = 1 is

n =

1

162z d3x ~a ~b

(1) =

2(x1 + ix2)
2x3  i(1  r2)

(14)

(15)

(a hopf map has to be single valued, but may well be singular, as  =  is just the south
pole of the target s2). this (1), (15), leads to a hopf curvature ~b(1) via (12) that is just
the magnetic eld (11). here the question arises whether there are more solutions to (6),
(7) that are characterized by higher hopf maps, and we will nd that this is indeed the
case.

[remark: there is some arbitrariness in the choice of the normalization factor in front
of the area two-form (13). we chose it for a target two-sphere of radius one. consequently,
the magnetic eld (11) is the hopf curvature of the standard hopf map (15) with hopf
index 1, and the background eld (4) is minus 1/4 the hopf curvature of the standard
map (15). there are other choices in the literature, e.g. for target two-spheres with radius
1/2 or 1/2. e.g., for radius 1/2 the magnetic eld (11) is twice the hopf curvature
of the standard hopf map (15) (and the background eld (4) is minus 1/2 the hopf
curvature of the standard map (15)). such higher (integer) multiples of ~b(1) may be
expressed by higher hopf maps as follows. rewrite (1) as (1) = s exp(i), where s
and  are the modulus and phase of (1) respectively. then n ~b(1) may be computed via
(12) from (1)
n = s exp(in). here only integer n are allowed, because for a hopf map
with nonzero hopf index the phase  necessarily is multiply valued (see [4] for details).
it follows that the background eld (4) is not a hopf curvature (but a fraction thereof)
in our choice of conventions.]

next we should provide some more hopf maps that will give rise to more solutions
to (6), (7). we will produce these hopf maps by composing the standard hopf map with
some maps s2  s2, i.e.,

r : s3 (1)

 s2 r s2

(16)

in fact, as we use stereographic coordinates on s2, we will use rational maps for r,

r : z  r(z) =

p (z)
q(z)

(17)

which are well-known to produce maps s2  s2 (here p , q are polynomials) [22, 23].
the winding number of the map is equal to the degree of the rational map, deg(r),

deg(r) = max(p, q)

(18)

where p and q are the degrees of the polynomials p and q. in fact, we want to restrict
to the simplest maps

i.e., we map

rn(z) = zn

(n) = ((1))n

or, for modulus s and phase  of (1),

where the modulus and phase of the standard hopf map (15) are

(s, )  (sn, n),

s2 =

4(r2  x2

for the hopf curvature this implies (t := s2, where s2 is the square of the modulus s,
rather than the two-sphere)

obeys the following nonlinear dierential equation (  /t )

m  + t m  = 2

em  1
(1 + t )2

(24)

(25)

for all n, as may be checked easily.

next we need some facts about the dirac equation (6). suppose a pair (, ai) is given

that solves (6), then ai may be expressed in terms of the zero mode  as

ai =

(

now we introduce the zero modes

b =

(26)

(27)

(28)

where  is the zero mode (9) and m is an (at the moment arbitrary) function of t . due
to the fact that t,ii  t,ib(1)
is given in (11)), which is obvious from
(12), it is still true that (m )
i,i = 0, i.e., (m ) really is a zero mode. the corresponding
gauge eld a(m )
that solves the dirac equation together with (m ) reads (we use (26))

i = 0 (where b(1)

where we have used m,k = m t,k, t,knk = 0 and ( ~n 2),k = 0. after some tedious algebra,
we arrive at the expression

b(m )

l = b(0)

l 

8(1 + t )2
(1 + r2)2 (m  + t m )nl

(31)

now we want to insert this into the second equation, (7) (the chernsimons equation).
therefore, we have to subtract the background eld (4), b(0)
i = 16(1 +
r2)2ni. we nd that

i  bb

i = b(1)

b(m )

l =

(1 + r2)2 (m  + t m )nl

l =

(1 + r2)2 nl

(32)

or, after multiplication by nl,

m  + t m  = 2

em  1
(1 + t )2

(33)

which is precisely eq. (25). hence, the hopf maps (16), (19) provide innitely many
solutions to the system of equations (6) and (7) (the dirac and chernsimons equations).

3 discussion

we have shown that, in the presence of the xed prescribed background magnetic eld
(4), there exists an innite number of fully three-dimensional solutions to the system
of equations (6), (7). further, these solutions (i.e., the magnetic elds) are the hopf
curvatures of the hopf maps (16), (20) and are, therefore, labelled by the corresponding
hopf index n = n  z.
here the background eld (4) was crucial, because it determines the inhomogeneous
part of the non-linear dierential equation (33), and, because of this non-linearity, the
inhomogeneous part of (33) crucially aects the nature of the solutions of (33) (in fact,
it seems dicult to nd solutions at all for a changed inhomogeneous part).

before closing, we want to briey discuss whether it is possible to further interpret
the background eld (4), beyond just stating that its presence is crucial for the existence
of the solutions (16), (20). indeed, there are (at least) two interpretations that we want
to describe now.

firstly, let us study the following zero modes (ml) = exp(ml/2), analogous to (28),

where we now choose

ml = l ln

t 1/2
1 + t

.

(34)

it follows easily that (we introduce spherical coordinates (x1, x2, x3)  (r, , ) and mul-
tiply by the pure gauge factor exp(il) for convenience)

l := eil(ml) =

2l+2rl

(1 + r2)l (1 + i~x~)  yl,l(, )

0

!

(35)

6

where yl,l are spherical harmonics. in other words, l is just a higher angular momentum
zero mode (with magnetic quantum number m = l + 1/2) that can be constructed from
the simplest zero mode (9), see [20, 21]. the gauge eld a(l)
that solves the dirac equation
j
(6) together with l may be computed easily, and its magnetic eld is

b(l)

j =

12 + 8l
(1 + r2)2 nj

(36)

i.e., adding one unit of angular momentum to l changes the corresponding magnetic eld
by 8(1 + r2)2 ~n, which is precisely minus two times the background magnetic eld (4).
it is, therefore, tempting to conjecture that the background eld (4) is somehow related
to the half-integer intrinsic angular momentum (i.e., spin) of the fermion. of course, this
is just an observation at this point, because a mechanism that generates this background
eld is still missing.

secondly, it is possible to re-interpret the background eld ~ab, (4), as a spin connec-
tion  in the dirac equation (6) on a conformally at manifold with torsion. generally,
the dirac operator with spin connection reads (see e.g. [24] for details)

d/ = aea

( + a +

1
4

[b, c]bc

)

(37)

where a ( a in our case) are the usual dirac matrices, ea
 is the inverse vielbein and
bc
 is the spin connection (here ,  are einstein (i.e., space time) indices and a, b, c are
lorentz indices). our dirac equation (6) may be rewritten in the form of eq. (37) provided
that the vielbein is conformally at, ea
a , where f is an arbitrary function. using
[b, c] = 2ibcdd we nd

(38)

(here k is an einstein index in three dimensions). the l.h.s. of (38) has to be antisym-

mmetric in a, d, i.e., the quantity eda := k
eab = abck

k . if we further assume ab

metric) then we nd that

abk = kaab

k = ba

c  ack

b )kf  (abc  acb)

where

abc = ec

kabk = f k

c abk.

k obeys eda = ead. this leads to

k (i.e., covariant constancy of the

kab

k ). finally, we nd for the

(39)

(40)

(41)

hence, with abk given by (39), we may freely choose a conformally at metric (i.e.,
conformal factor f ) and compute the resulting torsion via (40). due to the form of abk
(i.e., ~ab) it is, however, not possible to choose a conformal factor such that the torsion
is zero. on the other hand, it is possible to choose the at metric f = 1, so that (the
anti-symmetric part of) the spin connection is given just by the torsion.
