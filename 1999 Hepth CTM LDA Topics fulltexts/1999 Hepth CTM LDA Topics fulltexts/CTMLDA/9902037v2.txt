we describe the local d=4 eld theory on deformed minkowski space as nonlocal relativistic
eld theory on standard minkowski spacetime. for simplicity the case of -deformed scalar eld
 with the interaction 4 is considered, and the deformed interaction vertex is described. it
appears that fundamental mass parameter  plays a role of regularizing imaginary paulivillars
mass in deformed propagator.

introduction

the conventional eldtheoretic models in elementary
particle physics (e.g. standard model  yang-mills theory
with spinorial and higgs sector) are described by quan-
tum eld theory on standard d=4 minkowski space. the
addition of gravity eects can be realized in the following
two steps:

a) we consider eldtheoretic models in curved back-
ground of classical gravitational eld, describing curved
spacetime geometry.

b) further we quantize curved spacetime geometry by

considering quantized gravitational eld.

at present it is not known how to handle with reason-
able accuracy the quantum gravity modication of ge-
ometry, e.g. describe eld theories in the background
of quantized geometries.
it is known moreover, that
due to divergent quantum eects in einstein gravity the
notion of classical spacetime can not be used at dis-
tances comparable and smaller than the planck length lp
(lp  1033cm) (see e.g. [1-3]). in front of this diculty
one way of generalizing the standard framework of local
relativistic elds is to replace classical spacetime points
by some primary extended objects (e.g.
fundamental
strings, p-branes etc.) providing new eld theory (e.g.
string eld theory) which leads to nite quantum correc-

tions. another way, closer to the idea of quantized ge-
ometry, is to replace commuting spacetime coordinates
by noncommuting generators of a quantized minkowski
space. there is a hope that such a quantized spacetime
geometry will provide additional convergence factors or
even nite quantum eld theory. indeed, as we shall show
below, if we introduce masslike deformation parameter
, it occurs also as a regularizing imaginary paulivillars
large mass parameter, describing tachyonic pole in the 
deformed propagator.

i. deformed d = 4 relativistic

symmetries

the standard spacetime coordinates x = (~x, x0) can
be described as translations which form the abelian sub-
group of d = 4 poincare group p4 (formally one can
identify the minkowski space with the coset p4/o(3, 1),
where o(3, 1) describes the lorentz subgroup). simi-
larly the properties of four relativistic momenta can be
described by the four translation generators of d = 4
poincare algebra.
in such a scheme one considers the
relativistic poincare symmetries, described by the dual

supported by kbn grant 2p03b13012

pair - d = 4 poincare group and d = 4 poincare alge-
bra - as primary geometric notions from which the prop-
erties of minkowski space, fourmomenta as well as rel-
ativistic phase space are derived. this primary status
of symmetries we shall keep also in the case when the
classical relativistic framework is modied by the proce-
dure of quantum deformations. in analogy with classical
case, the quantum minkowski space and quantum four-
momentum space can be obtained, respectively, from the
translation sector of d=4 quantumdeformed poincare
group and fourmomentum generators belonging to quan-
tum poincare algebra.

in the last years there were proposed dierent quantum
deformations of d=4 poincare symmetries (see e.g. [4-7])
in the form of real noncommutative and noncocommuta-
tive hopf algebras. in particular, as a rst such defor-
mation there was proposed the socalled deformation
[4,5] introducing fundamental mass (or length) param-
eter . the deformed poincare algebra [4,8] is the
associative and coassociative hopf algebra with genera-
tors m = (mi = 1
2 ijkmjk, ni = mi0 pk = (pi, p0)
satisfying the relations1

[m, m ] = i ( m  m + m

  m) ,

[mi, pj ] = iijkpk ,

[mi, p0] = ipi ,

[ni, pj ] = iij(cid:20)(cid:18)

(1.1c)

(1.1d)

the classical poincare algebra is obtained in the limit
  .

the hopf algebra (1.1ad) has its dual form, generated

by the following duality relations

hp , xi =

(1.2a)

(1.2b)

in accordance with general scheme the dual generators
(x,  ) describe deformed poincare group. using du-
ality relations between arbitrary powers of the generators
(p , m  ) and (x,  ) as well as the property of inner
product

ha  b, (a)i= ha  b, ai

h(a), a  bi = ha, a  bi

(1.3)

one can derive the following set of relations, dening 
deformed poincare group [5,8]:

a) algebraic relations

[x, x ] =

(

0 x   

0 x) ,

[

,

with the coproducts, antipodes and counits dened by

[

(pi) = pi  ep0/ + 1l  pi ,

(p0) = p0  1l + 1l  p0 ,

(1.1b)

s(mi) = mi ,

c) antipodes and counits

1the deformed algebra can be written with the use of
dierent basic generators. the one presented below uses so
called bicrossproduct basis [8] with the quantum deformation
in the algebraic sector occurring entirely in the cross com-
mutation relations of the abelian fourmomentum generators
with the classical lorentz generators.

from the fourier transform e(p) one can obtain also

a standard relativistic eld (x) on classical minkowski
space x  (xi, x0) by performing the classical fourier
transform

(x) =

(2)4z d4p e(p) eipx .

(1.10)

it is easy to see that in the limit    we get
x  x and the formula (1.7) describing quantum
fourier transform can be identied with the classical one,
given by (1.10).

we shall describe the deformation of relativistic lo-

cal eld theory in the following three steps:

1) we replace in conventional local relativistic eld
theory the classical minkowski coordinates x by quan-
tum minkowski coordinates x, and relativisticcovariant
dierential operators dening free elds by correspond-
ing covariant dierential operators on deformed
minkowski space. the deformed lagrangean is the
product of elds (1.7) and its derivatives and becomes
an element of noncommutative hopf algebra dened by
(1.5). the new action is obtained by integration of local
products of deformed elds and their derivatives over
deformed minkowski space.

2) in order to perform the integration we substitute in
the deformed lagrangean the fourier transforms (1.7),
apply the formula (1.9), and replace the integration over
deformed minkowski space by the deformed convo-
lution integrals in fourmomentum space. we can calcu-

late all occurring deformed integrals rr d4 x by using

the formula

(1.12c)

(x) = 0 .

(1.4c)

it should be observed that the relations (1.2b) and (1.2c)
remains undeformed, as for classical poincare group.

our aim in this paper is to consider the eld theory
on deformed minkowski space, described by the trans-
lation generators x of the deformed poincare group
(see (1.4ac)) after the contraction mapping 
.
the deformed hopf algebra hx describing the quan-
tum minkowski spacetime is generated by the coordi-
nates x and determined by the following basic relations:

  

[x0, xi] =

i


xi ,

[xi, xj] = 0 ,

(x) = x  1l + 1l  x ,

(1.5a)

(1.5b)

the dual hopf algebra hp of functions on deformed
fourmomenta is described by the hopf subalgebra of the
deformed poincare algebra (1.1ac) as follows

[p, p] = 0 ,

(1.6a)

(pi) = pi  ep0/ + 1l  pi ,

(p0) = p0  1l + 1l  p0 .

(1.6b)

the antipodes and counits in hx and hp remain classical.
an important tool will be the use of deformed
fourier
transform, describing the elds on non
commutative minkowski space with generators x =
(xi, x0) in the following way (px  pi xi  p0 x0)2

(x) =

(2)4z d4p e(p) : eipx ;

e(p) is a classical function on commuting fourmomentum

space p = (pi, p0) and (~p ~x  pi xi)

: eipx :

.
= eip0 x0 ei~p ~x .

(1.8)

the deformed exponential (1.4b) describes the
canonical element [9,10] or t matrix [11,12] for the pair
of dual hopf algebras hx and hp.

from (1.6b) and (1.8) follows that

: eipx : : eiqx : = : ei(2)(p,q)x :

(1.9)

where (2)(p, q) = (~p eq0/ + ~q, p0 + q0) is the fourmo-
mentum addition rule described by the coproduct (1.6b).

3p0
2one can also use in (1.7) the measure 4 = d4p e
 which
is invariant under the shift in fourmomentum space described
by the coproduct (1.6b).

which implies for example that

(1.13)

the integral (1.12a) in the two-dimensional case in dif-
ferent context has been used by majid [13,14].

3) in order to interprete the deformation in stan-
dard minkowski space we use the formula (1.10). the
deformed convolution integrals of fourier transforms

e(p) become the dependent nonlocal vertices of elds

(x) in standard minkowski space.

ii. deformed minkowski space:

differential bicovariant calculus,

vector fields and integration

in order to describe the eld equations on deformed
minkowski space one should consider corresponding dif-
ferential calculus and its covariance properties under the
action of deformed poincare group.

a) dierential bicovariant calculus.
on deformed h with four selfadjoint generators x
one can construct a vedimensional bicovariant dier-
ential calculus with the basis [15,16,17]

 5 = [dx, x] +

and (a = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

 a   b =  a   b ,

(2.2)

one can also dene the covariant right action of another
poincare group

r(x) = x   

  1l  a 
 ,

(2.6)

obtained by the change    in the formulae (1.2).
such right covariance quantum group provides the fol-
lowing covariance of the relations (2.2-3)

el( ) =     

 ,

el( 5) =  5  1l ,

(2.7)

b) deformed vector elds.
in order to dene the vector elds describing left or
right partial derivatives a acting on functions on 
deformed minkowski space we write:

df = l

a f   a =  a r

a f .

(2.8)

in particular, using leibnitz rule d(f g) = df g + f dg we
obtain that3

d : eipx : = : a(p)eipx :  a ,

(2.9)

where

i = ep0/ pi ,

(2.10)

(2.11)

where in the limit    we get m 2

p : eipx :=: 1

(p)  ~p 2  p2

i eipx : one obtains

d  = 0

d 5 = 2    .

(2.3)

the minkowski space (1.5a-b) carries the left covari-

ant action of poincare group (1.4a-c)

l(x) = 

  x + a  1l ,

(2.4)

and the relations (2.2-3) are covariant under the following
transformations of dierentials

a(x) = : a(cid:18) 1

i



x(cid:19) (x) :

(2.12)

using duality relations one can relate the derivatives on
deformed minkowski space with the fourmomentum
generators (1.4ab). in bicrossproduct basis one obtains

el( ) =

[18], where the quantum elds have c-number variations.

7it should be pointed out that the coassociativity of the co-
product (4) provides the associativity of the product 4(x),
i.e., (x)2(x) = 2(x)(x) etc.

it should be mentioned, however, that the expansion
in 1
 provides the terms proportional to the powers of ~x
and the nature of the nonlocality described by the ex-
ponential of dierential operator is not well described by
such a power expansion.8

at present we consider this nonconservation of the
fourmomenta at deformed vertices as a serious di-
culty.

the formulae (3.21) and (3.23) describing nonlocal in-
teraction vertex can be used in the case when the eld

(x) is classical (the fourier components e(x) commut-

ing) as well as in the quantized case. using perturbative
expansion in coupling constant  one can derive from
(3.12) and (3.21) the modied rules for deformed feyn-
man diagrams, with

i) the internal lines described by the propagator (3.12)
ii)
introducing deformed four

vertices

the

momentum conservation law (see (3.13))

4 (p1 + . . . + p4)  (4) (p1, p2, p3, p4) .

(3.25)

unfortunately due to (3.2a) the deformed feynman di-
agrams will have an unusual property: the fourmomen-
tum through virtual lines is not conserved. for example
if we consider the selfenergy diagram in deformed 4
theory the standard undeformed formula

iv. conclusions

we would like to point out that in this paper we present
a new scheme providing the rules how to calculate the
corrections to the fourdimensional local relativistic inter-
acting eld theory in the presence of quantum deforma-
tions9. our scheme can be described by the following
diagram:

the scheme is valid for any deformation of d=4
poincare symmetries with commutative fourmomenta.
such deformations can be described by the poincare
quantum group with the following bicrossproduct struc-
ture:

p (q) = o(3, 1)  t (q)

4

,

(4.1)

(3.26)

where

- o(3, 1) is the classical lorentz algebra, with primitive

coproducts (classical hopf-lie algebra).

- t (q)

4

describes the hopf algebra of translations (see
(1.5a-b) in our case) deformed in a way preserving the
primitive coproduct (1.5b).

it appears that the deformed spacetime translations

(3.27)

t (q)

should be described by a set of relations

we see from (3.27) that the virtual process imply the
dissipation of the fourmomenta.

(4.2)

8in similar way the nite shift operator eax is very inaccu-
rately approximated by the powers (ax)n.
9it should be mentioned that the deformation of local in-
teraction vertices in the presence of spacetime coordinates
commuting to a nonvanishing cnumber (see [1]) were con-
sidered by filk [22]. recently also the deformations of two
dimensional theories were considered in [23].

with suitable conditions for the dimensionless coecients
c
 , t, which can be obtained from the results pre-
sented in [7]. the deformation described in this paper
is distinguished by the property that it preserves the clas-
sical nonrelativistic o(3) symmetries.

in conclusion we would like to point out the follow-
ing two problems which we found while considering our
corrections:

i) the modication of classical fourmomentum conser-

vation law.

the corrections to the local vertices are nonlocal in
time and from the point of view of classical relativistic
invariance are not translationinvariant (see e.g. (3.21)
and (3.24)). this property occurs always when in (4.2)
c

 6= 010
ii) the nonsymmetric coproduct of threemomenta re-
quires some novel approach to the problem of statistics
and the notion of bosons and fermions in the presence of
deformation.

the rst diculty means that the deformed eld
theory looks quite dierent from the undeformed one,
and it is not yet clear how such modied eld theory and
modied energymomentum conservation laws could be
useful in fundamental interactions theory. this paper
should be treated rather as an indication of new fea-
tures and problems which are met when we modify local
eld theory in a way covariant under quantumdeformed
poincare symmetries. in particular because the abelian
addition law for the fourmomenta described by their co-
products are modied (see (1.6b) and (1.12c) the nonlo-
calities are necessarily required by the deformed form
of translational invariance.

the second diculty we consider to be rather of tech-
nical nature, which should be solved by the introduction
of some highly nontrivial unitary operator, representing
the exchange of spacetime position of two deformed

bosonic or fermionic particles (for the solution of an anal-
ogous but much simpler problem see [24]).

it should be mentioned that preliminary results of this
paper have been presented at xxii international collo-
quium on grouptheoretic methods in july 1998 (ho-
bart, tasmania).
