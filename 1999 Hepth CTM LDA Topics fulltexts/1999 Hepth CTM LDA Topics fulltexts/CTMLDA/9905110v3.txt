abstract

in this paper, fermions are minimally coupled to 3d-gravity with dynamical torsion. a kalb-ramond
eld is also introduced and non-minimally coupled to the fermions in a gauge-invariant way. we show
that a 1-loop mass generation mechanism takes place for both the 2-form gauge eld and the torsion.
as for the fermions, no mass is dynamically generated: at 1-loop, there is only a fermion mass shift
proportional to the yukawa coupling whenever these fermions already have a non-vanishing tree-level
mass.

1 introduction

the mechanism of dynamical (gauge-invariant) mass generation in 2d and 3d gauge theories has received
a great deal of attention over the past two decades [1, 2, 3]. planar gauge theories, massless or massive,
reveal many peculiarities that justify more detailed investigations [4].

having in mind that topologically massive 3d gravity with dynamical torsion exhibits a number
of peculiar results [5, 6], we propose here to pursue the investigation of dynamical mass generation
for fermionic matter and a 2-form gauge potential that interact with gravitational eld whose torsion
uctuations dominate over the metric excitations. in practice, this means that we adopt 3d space-time as
a at background on which the torsion degrees of freedom propagate and interact with matter and gauge
elds - it might corresponds to a physical situation where the torsion eld is produced by a cosmological
neutrino sea [7]. in so doing, we actually isolate the genuine contributions of torsion to the problem of
dynamical mass generation.

we initially tackle the issue of mass generation for both the fermion and the torsion itself. the
yukawa-like interaction between the scalar component of the torsion - this is a feature of 3d space-time -
and the fermion yields a 1-loop mass correction for the latter. on the other hand, the uctuation of the
torsion scalar may acquire a 1-loop mass proportional to the fermion mass parameter. these results are
treated in section 2.

proceeding further, in section 3, we discuss the interaction between a 3d kalb-ramond-type (k-r)
eld and fermions with non-minimal coupling. as a free eld, the former has no on-shell degrees of
freedom, as a peculiarity of three space-time dimensions. however, the fermions, that couple to both
the torsion and the 2-form gauge potential, induce a 1-loop self-energy mixing among these elds in the
eective action, so that the k-r eld becomes dynamical and acquires a non-trivial mass. we check that
unitarity is ensured at 1-loop and show that the longitudinal degree of freedom excited at the k-r eld
does not correspond to a ghost.

our concluding remarks are presented in section 4.

2 matter coupling

we start by setting up a few relations and properties of riemann-cartan space-time that we shall make
use of throughout this work. the ane connection is non-symmetric in the rst two indices. its non-
symmetric part, 2
can be split as below:

 , is the torsion tensor [8]. in this space-time,  


[] = t 



 

 =(cid:8) 

(cid:9) + k 

 ,

(1)

k 

where (cid:8) 

 = 1
this implies that, in such a framework, n-dimensional gravity is described by two independent objects,

(cid:9) is the christoel symbol, completely determined by the metric and its derivatives, and
2(cid:0)t 
 (cid:1) is the contortion tensor, which is antisymmetric in the last two indices.

  t 

 + t 

namely, the metric and the torsion tensors.

in 3d, the 9 degrees of freedom of the torsion can be covariantly decomposed into its so(1,2)-
irreducible components: a trace part, t  t 
3! t, and a
traceless rank-2 symmetric tensor, x. the splitting in the above components is accomplished by the
following relation:

 , a totally antisymmetric part,   1

t =  +

(t  t ) + x 

.

the peculiarity of 3d, as compared to 4d-gravity, is the appearance of a scalar component for the torsion.
in this work, we shall be concerned with the minimal coupling between fermions and torsion. as we
shall soon understand, only the -component indeed minimally couples to fermions. on the other hand,
it is worthwhile to mention that the spin-2 component, x , plays a peculiar role when chern-simons
gravity is considered: it inuences the spin-2 sector of the graviton propagator and it is responsible for
the appearance of a massive ghost-like mode in the spectrum [5].

at rst sight, the easier way to obtain interactions between torsion and relativistic elds is through
a covariant derivative under the minimal coupling prescription. as we have seen, the ane connection
contains a torsion-dependent piece, and therefore in each covariant derivative of the eld under consider-
ation there is an interaction with torsion. however, we must be careful since this procedure, in the case
of some elds, may spoil the gauge invariance of the theory. in fact, an abelian gauge eld, a, cannot
interact minimally with torsion while keeping the gauge invariance requirement (the same occurs with
the k-r gauge eld, b , which will be object of study in section 3). for a scalar theory, the covariant
derivative is the usual one, and hence it does not minimally couple to torsion either. on the other hand,
the requirement that the dirac equation in a gravitational eld preserve local lorentz invariance yields
a direct interaction between torsion and fermions. in riemann-cartan space-time, the dirac action for a
massive fermion has the form

sd =z d3xg(cid:20) i

2(cid:0) d  d (cid:1)  m (cid:21) ,

where the covariant derivatives of the spinor elds are given by

d =  +

which is the gauge eld of the local lorentz group.  ab



is the riemannian part of the spin-connection:

where cba = e
 stands
for the dreibeins3. since we are here mainly interested in the interaction between torsion and fermions,

b (ea   ea) stands for the rotation coecients (see ref. [8] for details); ea

c e

3we are using the following representation for the dirac matrices in locally at 3d space-time: a = (cid:0)3, i1, i2(cid:1) ,

where i are the pauli matrices.

2

we set g =  . this amounts to saying that we wish to study torsion eects on a at background or,
rephrasing, the metric uctuations are taken to be very weak as compared to the torsion excitations.

after some algebra, the dirac lagrangian in the presence of torsion is given by,

l0 =  (i  m)  +

i

k [  ],

(8)

where [  ] means the totally antisymmetric product of three dirac matrices. using the identity,
[  ] = i3!1, the interaction term can be shown to simplify to:

 .

(9)

thus, the interaction of torsion and fermions is seen to be a yukawa coupling. we would like to point
out that a detailed discussion on the coupling of dirac fermions to gravity is presented in the works of
ref. [9]. in our case, since we are conned to 3d, chiral fermions cannot appear and our discussion on
the dynamical mass generation does not involve the consideration of the anomaly problem.

propagating and self-interactions terms for torsion, if not introduced by hand, according to the ar-
guments of refs. [11, 12], may be justied on more geometrical grounds, as coming from powers of the
ricci tensor and curvature scalar, as it can be readily seen with the help of:

1

2(cid:0) 

    2(cid:1) ,

r =

r =

then

rr =

 +

4.

4

where we set g =  (at metric background); the metric uctuations are neglected as compared
to scalar torsion excitations, since we are mainly concerned with the interaction between torsion and
fermions. therefore, we rst consider the following action

where sd is given by (3) and sr is

s = sd + sr,

sr =z d3xg(cid:20)ar + b(cid:18)rr 

1
3

r2(cid:19)(cid:21) .

finally, we can write , in a at background, the lagrangian for fermions and torsion as follows:

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

1

l =

2(cid:0)  22(cid:1) +  (i  m)  +  ,

where we have redened the eld    = b, so that 2 = a

. it is worthy to point out
that the free action for the scalar is nothing but the dimensionally reduced form of the torsion action
proposed in the ref. [12]. notice that we must require that b > 0 and a > 0 to ensure that 2 be positive
and that  be real. moreover, the canonical dimensions of the elds and parameters are given below:

b and  = 3
4b

[] =

2

;

[] = 1;

[b] = 1;

[a] = 1.

(16)

in the work by baekler and mielke [10], one discusses the most general gauge-invariant action for
gravity with torsion. in our case, since we have in mind to keep only torsion excitations (we neglect the
vielbein uctuations), we do not need to add up the translational chern-simons term discussed in such
work, since the one would amount to a linear term in the torsion.

the particular combination of the curvature square terms in the action (14) suppresses the quartic
scalar self-interaction term. also, we notice that, for massless fermions (m = 0), the lagrangian (15) has
parity (p) symmetry, since  (pseudo-scalar) and  are not separately invariant under this symmetry
operation in 3d, namely

 p ,
 p  ,

3

(17)

so that   p  . we shall come back to this point later on, in connection with the question of

fermion mass generation.

now, we can extract the feynman rules for the theory. the propagators for the scalar and spinor

elds that stem from the free action are as follows:

i0 (p) =

i

p2  2

and

is0 (p) =

i

6 p  m

.

furthermore, the fermion-torsion vertex is given by

v (, ) = i.

(18)

(19)

since  carries dimension 1
2 , one can see that this vertex is super-renormalisable. in fact, a power-counting
analysis shows that the supercial degree of divergence of primitively divergent graphs, , decreases as
the number of vertices increases:

 = 3 

vn 

e  e,

(20)

1
2

1
2

where vn is the number of vertices, while e and e are the external lines associated to  and ,
respectively.

from these results, we turn into the calculation of the self-energy corrections for the bare propagators
and discuss the mechanism of mass generation for massless elds, by looking at the poles of the 1-loop
corrected propagators. for the fermion self-energy graph, we nd:

 i (p) = (i)2 (i)2z

d3l
(2)3

(6 p 6 l + m)

h(p  l)2  m2i (l2  2)

.

(21)

as we are interested in reading o a mass generation, we are allowed to set the external momentum to
zero. in so doing, we nd

the insertion of this 1-loop graph leads to the following 1-loop corrected propagator:

 i (0) = i

2m

.

4 (|m| + ||)

is = is0 + is0 (i) is0 + ...

=

i

.

6 p  m  

(22)

(23)

the above result shows that, if we had started with a massless torsion4, the fermion self-energy correction
(22) would still be dierent from zero and given exclusively in terms of the yukawa coupling, . however,
we warn that this result should not be interpreted as a dynamical mass generation for the fermion, since
taking the limit m  0 after perturbative calculations have been done is not a consistent procedure [13];
had we started o with massless fermions and torsion (m =  = 0), we would have found

 i (p) =

2
16

6 p
pp2

,

(24)

and so no mass would be dynamically generated for the fermion, what would be consistent with the parity
invariance of models with massless fermions in 3d: no parity-anomaly should be induced perturbatively
in a model with massless fermions. therefore, from (22) and  = 0, one obtains a modied propagator

also, the torsion self-energy is calculated, and we get

.

4(cid:17)2
(23) which has a massive pole at p2 =(cid:16)m  2

(25)

4torsion with vanishing mass yields the same infra-red problem as found in qed3.

4

similarly, the modied torsion propagator is obtained by summing up the series

i = i0 + i0 (i) i0 + ...

(26)

=

i

p2  2 + 

.

here, we have another mass correction, at this time for the pole of the torsion propagator. from this
result, we conclude that, whenever the torsion eld mediates the interaction between massive fermions,
it exhibits a short range behavior.. in other words, if we consider, from the beginning, a massless torsion
theory by setting a = 0, its 1-loop corrected propagator exhibits a pole at p2 = m2
 . we should stress
that dynamical mass generation for torsion requires its coupling to massive fermions.

to conclude this section, we would like to make a short comment on the possibility of getting mass
for the fermion by means of parity spontaneous breaking in our model. with massless fermions, having
in mind that 4- and 6- terms could have been introduced via rr , r2 and r3 the most general
higgs-like potential in 3d comes out (6-th order in ). setting suitably the parameters such that the
-eld acquires a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value (v.e.v), fermions would become massive upon
the spontaneous breaking of p by means of such a v.e.v. [14]. this shows that the fermions may acquire
mass already at tree-level and, according to our previous discussion, 1-loop eects will simply provide a
shift in the pole of the fermion propagator.

so far, we have been dealing with a theory involving torsion and a spinor eld. next, we wish to
include the k-r eld and to study a possible way to endow it with a mass and a dynamical character by
means of the fermion-mediated interaction that couples it to torsion.

3 mass generation for the k-r field

following the same procedure as in the previous section, we shall now examine the behavior of the
antisymmetric k-r eld, b, in 3d and the mechanism of mass generation for such a eld whenever
fermions are considered. the motivation to study 2-form gauge elds in 3d may be justied by the
interest of studying supersymmetric self-dual vortices with anomalous magnetic moment coupling [15]
and supersymmetric cosmic string congurations, as recently discussed in the work of ref. [16].

we start from the well-known free action for this eld:

where g is the eld-strength, written in terms of b as5

sg =

1

6z d3xggg,

g = b + b + b .

(27)

(28)

in order to obtain the free propagator of the theory, one must to x this gauge invariance; we choose

the following gauge-xing term

sgf = z d3xg(cid:16)  b(cid:17)2
where  = 
3! b is the dual of b. the tilde on  means that we are
considering only the riemannian part of the connection in the covariant derivative. this gauge-xing
dictates a ghost term in the action. however, since we have , rather than , the ghosts do not couple
to torsion, but exclusively to the metric degrees of freedom of the gravitational sector. nevertheless, since
we are assuming that the latter are not excited, the ghost-gravity coupling introduced by eq. (29) need
not be taken into account.

g and b = 1

(29)

,

it is worthy to remind that, in 4d, b has one on-shell degree of freedom and its main application
is in connection with the gauge invariant mechanism of mass generation for the electromagnetic eld
a through the topological coupling term f b. however, in 3d, the free b-eld does not
have on-shell degrees of freedom; therefore, it appears only in the internal lines of feynman diagrams
describing physical amplitudes.

5the action is invariant under the local gauge transformation b (x) =  (x)    (x), where  is an arbitrary

vector.

5

then, following our study of dynamical mass generation in 3d theories, we propose (based on the work
of re. [15]) the following interaction term between fermions and b, without spoiling gauge invariance:

si = z d3xb ,

(30)

in an attempt to obtain a (dynamical) on-shell degree of freedom for b. actually, the interacting term
in (30) naturally shows up in an n=2 supersymmetric model where a non-minimal magnetic moment
coupling favors the formation of topological vortices [15].

perhaps, it would be advisable, for the sake of clarity, to emphasize that b can couple only non-
minimally to fermions, since the latter do not transform under the u (1) - symmetry associated to b.
so, the only way to have a gauge-invariant coupling is through its eld strength, g. on the other hand,
as long as torsion is concerned, its non-minimal coupling to fermions yield dynamical mass generation
for the latter [14]; however, they do not contribute 1-loop corrections to the mass of the k-r eld - this
is why we do not take such a non-minimal coupling into account here.

here  carries dimension  1

2 , and hence the renormalizability of the theory is certainly lost. so, one
can consider this only as a low-energy eective theory. in this sense, we begin with a lagrangian in the
at space-time background, which becomes from the sum of (13), (27), (29) and (30), namely

1

l =

2(cid:0)  22(cid:1) + (b)2 + (cid:0)b(cid:1)2

+  (i  m)  +   + b ,

(31)

where the bilinear sector of the lagrangian leads, besides the propagators listed in (18) for torsion and
fermion elds, to the following b-propagator

ig

0 (p) =

i

2p2 (cid:18) 1



 + (cid:19) ,

(32)

 and  being the transverse and longitudinal projectors in the space of vectors, respectively. notice
that the k-r eld appears in (31) through its dual (b).

now, we can verify the absence of on-shell degrees of freedom for the massless vector eld (the k-r
eld), by saturating its propagator with external currents j, which satises the following conservation
law:

in 3d, a general current may be expanded with respect to a particular basis

pj = 0.

j = ap + bp + c,

(33)

(34)

where p = (cid:0)p0, ~p(cid:1) , p = (cid:0)p0,~p(cid:1) , and  = (0, ~) . however, (33) implies that b = c = 0. there-
fore, taking the imaginary part of the residue (at the pole p2 = 0) of the transition amplitude, a =
j (p) g

0 (p) j (p), we obtain

imres (a) = lim
p20

|a|2
2

p2 = 0.

(35)

from this result, we nd that the massless pole does not propagate.

vertex is as follows:

returning to the feynman rules, the torsion-fermion vertex is given by (19), whereas the b  
(36)

v (b, ) = p.

once the feynman rules for the theory have been derived, we turn out to calculate the self-energy

correction for the complete propagator.

besides the usual self-energy corrections to the torsion and b-propagators, there is an additional
mixed self-energy graph which contains one -eld and one b-eld as external lines. this 1-loop graph
induces an indirect b   coupling and, by virtue of this mixing, we shall achieve the situation of
dynamical mass generation.
then, using the above feynman rules, one arrives at the following results for self-energy graphs of the

elds:

i = i

i =

m2


m

p2 ,

p,



6

(37)

(38)

where i and i are the b  b and the mixed b   1-loop self-energy diagrams, respectively
(the self-energy for the torsion eld is the same as in (22)).
the contribution of eq. (38) amounts to the radiative generation of a nite mixing term of the form
b in the 1-loop eective action. as we shall check below, such a term does not spoil the
spectrum, as no ghost state is shown to be excited. this result suggests us that a term like the one
above could have already been introduced at tree-level, and its overall eect would simply be a shift in
the masses.

hence, the total self-energy for the b   system is more suitably set in a matrix form:

i(t ) =  i m2
 p2
 m
2 p

 ! .

m
2 p
i m2

analogously, the inverse propagator for this system is set in a diagonal matrix form

0 =(cid:18) (cid:0)2p2 + 2p2(cid:1)
d1

0

the inverse of the modied propagator is given by

0

(cid:0)p2  2(cid:1) (cid:19) .

replacing (39) and(40) in (41), d1 reads as

d1 = d1

0 + (t ).

d1 =  2p2 + 2(cid:16)1 + m2

2 (cid:17) p2

im
2 p

 im

2 p

p2  2  m2

 ! .

(39)

(40)

(41)

(42)

the corrected propagators are nally obtained in momentum space by inverting this matrix. so, the
complete propagator for the b-eld reads as follows:

ig (p) = i


1

2p2

where

 + (cid:16)p2  2  m2

 (cid:17)(cid:16)1 + m2

2 (cid:17)1

2p2 (p2  m 2)

m 2 = 2 +

m2



+

1

2(cid:18) m

2 (cid:19)2(cid:18)1 +

m2

2 (cid:19)1

.

,




(43)

(44)

this shows that the minimal coupling of torsion to matter is fundamental to obtain a massive pole for
the gauge eld, since if  = 0 (m 2 = 2), only the massless pole survives, as it can be seen from (43).
moreover, for the imaginary part of the residue at the massive pole, we obtain a positive result, namely

imres (a) = |a|2

4

2 (cid:17)2
(cid:16) m
2 (cid:17)2 > 0,
(cid:16)1 + m2

(45)

which ensures propagation of a physical degree of freedom. therefore, the indirect coupling between
torsion and the k-r eld in 3d, as mediated by fermionic matter, results in the appearance of a massive
propagating pole at the physical longitudinal sector of b.

4 concluding remarks

the central idea of the present paper is to illustrate how torsion may play a role in dynamically generating
mass for 3d theories coupled to gravity. fermions minimally coupled to torsion pick out only the scalar
component of the latter, and their interaction provides the fermions with a 1-loop non-vanishing mass
correction that does not depend on the fermion tree-level mass, but only on the coupling constant. for
massless fermions, our viewpoint is that no mass is dynamically generated for the fermions. on the other
hand, torsion itself may acquire a non-vanishing mass by means of 1-loop radiative correction.

as long as a k-r eld is coupled to 3d-gravity via fermions, the interesting result we get concerns the
1-loop generation of dynamics for the longitudinal component of such a eld: a massive and physical pole

7

is induced as a by-product of the coupling between torsion and the fermionic matter that also couples to
the 2-form gauge potential.

as a general conclusion from our analysis we state that torsion sets the stage for dynamical mass

generation for bosonic elds in 3d provided non-minimal couplings are present.
