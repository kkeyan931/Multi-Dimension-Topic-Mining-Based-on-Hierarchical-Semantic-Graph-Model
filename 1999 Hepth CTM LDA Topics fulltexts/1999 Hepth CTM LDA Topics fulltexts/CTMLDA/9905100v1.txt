abstract

we study dynamical gauge symmetry breaking via compactied space in the frame-

work of su(n) gauge theory on m d1s1 (d = 4, 5, 6) space-time. especially, we study in

detail the gauge symmetry breaking in su(2) and su(3) gauge theories when the models

contain both fundamental and adjoint matters. as the result, we nd that any pattern

of gauge symmetry breaking is realized by selecting appropriate set of numbers (nf, nad)

in these cases. it is achieved without tuning boundary conditions of matter elds. as

the by-product, in some cases we get eective potential which has no curvature at the

minimum thus leading to massless higgs scalars, irrespectively of the size of compactied

space.

1 introduction

the gauge hierarchy problem and higher dimensional gauge theories we

proposed a possibility of solving gauge hierarchy problem[1] invoking to higher dimensional

gauge symmetry.

our main idea in the scenario was the following. suppose we consider a gauge theory on

the d dimensional manifold m minkow  m extra, where m minkow is an ordinary minkowskian

4 dimensional space-time and m extra is compactied spatial (d  4) dimensional manifold.

gauge elds am on m minkow  m extra has 4 + (d  4) components:

a( = 0, ..., 3), am(m = 4, ..., d  1).

(1)

if we regard zero-modes of d  4 components of gauge elds as higgs scalars, we can

avoid quadratically divergent quantum correction of higgs boson masses thanks to the

higher dimensional gauge symmetry.

in the previous work[1], we considered a qed model on m d1  s1 space-time and

took an zero-mode of d-th component of gauge eld as a higgs scalar. we calculated also

the quantum mass correction of d-th component of gauge eld. as the result we conrmed

the disappearance of the quadratic divergence. we, however, have found that nite mass

correction to the higgs remains, which is generally proportional to the inverse of s1

radius.

although the gauge hierarchy problem in its original sense has been solved, as the

quadratic divergence has disappeared, several issues have to be settled for the scenario to

be realistic. here we address to the following two important issues. (i) in our toy model on

m 4  s1, the higgs mass mh gets nite but generally large quantum correction provided

the radius of s1 is as small as gut or planck length[1]. then the issue is how we can

make the nite correction to mh small, comparable to the weak scale or so. (ii) the toy

model on m 4  s1 was higher dimensional qed. the u(1) gauge symmetry, therefore, is

1

not spontaneously broken, even though the higgs, d-th component of the photon eld has

non-vanishing vacuum expectation value (vev). this is simply because the higgs eld

is electrically neutral, and there appears a possibility to break the gauge symmetry, once

the theory is extended to the non-abelian gauge (yang-mills) theory, where the higgs

behaves as adjoint representation of gauge group.

as for the rst issue (i) we already have discussed a few possibilities to settle the

problem in the previous work[1]. the rst rather trivial possibility is to assume a large

compactication scale such as tev1 [2][3].

it is interesting to note that such large

scale compactication has attracted revived interest, partially inspired by the progress

in superstring/m theories [4]. the second possibility is to utilize a heavy electron with

the mass m satisfying ml  1 (l: circumference of s1). then the correction to mh is

suppressed roughly as exp(ml)/l (exp(ml) corresponds to the boltzmann factor in

nite temperature eld theory). it has also been pointed out that the nite mass mh

can be regarded to come from a sort of aharonov-bohm eect on s1 space, and may

disappear if the compactied space is a simply-connected manifold. we have conrmed

the expectation in a toy model on s2, showing that mh identically vanishes.

the main purpose of this paper is trying to settle the remaining second issue (ii). in

theories with s1 as the extra space, constant background or vev of gauge elds have

physical meaning as wilson loop, and can be dynamically xed by the minimization of

eective potential as the function of the background elds. thus in yang-mills theories

the vev behave just as the vev of adjoint higgs and the vev generally break the gauge

symmetry spontaneously: so-called hosotani mechanism[5].

to get a realistic gut-type theories, starting from higher dimensional yang-mills

theories, it is quite important to study how the gauge symmetry is dynamically broken by

the hosotani mechanism. in particular, we are interested in the question how the breaking

pattern of gauge symmetry depends on the choice of the representation (fundamental

2

or adjoint or ...) of matter elds. we will extensively study this point by taking two

representative gauge groups, su(2) and su(3). as the bonus we also nd an interesting

property of the theory, concerning the rst issue(i). namely, we realize in some case that

the curvature of the curve of the potential function identically vanishes, leading to mh = 0.

it should be noticed that this vanishing mh is obtained for arbitrary compactication scale

and without the introduction of simply-connected space like s2 [1].

gauge symmetry breaking and matter representation in hosotani mechanism

we briey review the history of the discussion on the gauge symmetry breaking via

hosotani mechanism especially about the case of m d1  s1 space-time conguration.

in 1983, hosotani found that a gauge symmetry may break down in the system of

su(n) gauge theories on m 3  s1 space-time. but it needed many (more than 16 avors)

complex scalar elds as matter led and non-trivial boundary condition for the matter

elds,  = /2 [5]. later it became obvious that for the case where fermions belong

fundamental representation of su(n) gauge group, gauge symmetry was never broken.

in 1989, it was found that su(2) gauge symmetry breaking is possible when fermions

are in adjoint representation [6][7] and it was shown that the pattern of gauge symmetry

breaking depends on congruency class of representation of the gauge group[7] [8].

many works have been done in this direction, giving a hope for using hosotani mech-

anism as a possible mechanism of gut symmetry breaking. this scenario has been

investigated to some extent [9][10].

but the case of where the theory contains both fundamental and adjoint representation

of fermion has never been investigated, except e6 model in ref.[7] and supersymmetric

models [12][13]. i was partially motivated by their works in supersymmetric models and

try to study the non supersymmetric version of gauge symmetry breaking via hosotani

mechanism in theories with both fundamental and adjoint matters.

2 dynamical gauge symmetry breaking through ex-

tra dimension

2.1 eective potential

we consider su(n) gauge theories on m d1  s1 space-time with both fundamental and

adjoint fermionic elds.

and f , (ad) are fermions in the fundamental (adjoint) representation and nf (nad) are

avor number of dirac fermion in the fundamental(adjoint)representation. indices m, n

run from 0 to d  1 (whereas ,  run from 0 to d  2) and j, k are avor indices. color

index has been omitted here. we use x, y as the coordinates on m d1, s1 respectively.

boundary conditions on s1 are taken as

a(x, y + l) = a(x, y)

f(x, y + l) = eif f(x, y)

ad(x, y + l) = eiadad(x, y),

(6)

where l is the compactication scale of s1 subspace and related to the radius of s1 as

l = 2r.

form a remaining subgroup of su(n) and other symmetries are broken. thus gauge

symmetry breaking is induced through dynamics in extra dimension.

the phases f, ad, relevant for the fermions boundary conditions, remain as non

dynamical parameters of the model and must be set by hand.

in the nad 6= 0 and

nf = 0 case [9] [10], the gauge symmetry breaking is controlled by changing the boundary

condition ads.

in this paper, however, we will show that we can also realize various patter of gauge

symmetry breaking by varying appropriate choice of nf, nad, even if simply take the

5

periodic boundary condition of fermions,

f = ad = 0.

when the periodic boundary condition is taken for fermions, ve is simplied as

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

so,we can calculate it analytically in some special values, or even numerically with arbi-

trary precision.

it is easy to show how each sector of the eective potential plays a role in the gauge

symmetry breaking. the combination of gauge and fundamental fermion sectors has

global minima at a symmetric s conguration where hw i is su(n) gauge symmetric.

on the other hand adjoint fermion sector has global minima at another s where hw i

allows only u(1)n symmetry. so we can expect that by changing nf and nad we get

variety of gauge symmetry breaking.

now some comments are in order.

eects of scalar eld it is obvious that if there are also some scalars in the theory,

n scalar

f,ad avor complex scalar elds contribution to the eective potential is calculated to

be given by replacing 2[d/2]nf,ad with 2n scalar

f,ad . so, nf, nad in eqs.(11)(12) should be

understood as

nr = n fermion

r



2
2[d/2] n scalar

r

6

(19)

where r stands for the representation and n fermion

r

, n scalar

r

is the number of avor of

fermions and scalars in the representation r, respectively. so nf,nad can be negative and

take even rational numbers.

our investigation can be applied for any region of (nf, nad) plane.

nad < (d  2)/2[d/2] region is investigated without loss of generality by investigating

nad = 0 case and has been already investigated by many authors. nad > (d 2)/2[d/2] and

nf = 0 region has also been investigated by the authors and has been claimed that the

gauge symmetry breaking is mainly handled by the boundary conditions of fermion elds.

but nad > (d  2)/2[d/2], nf 6= 0 region has not been investigated yet. so we study what

happens if both adjoint and fundamental matter are included in hosotani mechanism.

supersymmetry if majorana,weyl or majorana-weyl fermion exists in d-dimensional

space-time and if we take such type of fermion as the matter eld, instead of dirac

fermion, nr should be replaced by 1

2n weyl

r

, 1

2 n majorana

r

, or 1

4n majoranaweyl

r

, respectively.

it also must be pointed out that if a specic relation 2[d/2]nad  (d  2) = 0, nf = 0 holds

and all nad matter elds are fermionic, the fermionic elds can be regarded as gaugino

and the system may be regarded as super yang-mills theory. for supersymmetric pure

yang-mills theories, however, eective potentials calculated in this article all vanish and

will not be investigated further. when each eld has dierent boundary condition, other

than periodic ( 6= 0), it is not the case and symmetry breaking is caused even if nad =

(d  2)/2[d/2], nf = 0. it is related to the scherk-schwartz mechanism of supersymmetry

breaking [11][12][13] and we will present the results of investigation in such directions in

near future.

2.2 su(2) case

in su(2) case, the parameterization of background gauge elds is given as

hayigl = diag(, ).

(20)

su(2) symmetric gauge conguration corresponds to hayigl = diag(, ), or diag(0, 0).

so, when ve() has minima at  =  or  = 0, su(2) symmetry remains dynamically.

we search for global minima of v () for various nf, nad for periodic boundary condi-

tion (f = ad = 0). to see the contribution of each sector, v g+gh

e

, v f

e, v ad

e are plotted in

fig.1(a)(b)(c), respectively. in figure.1, we nd that the points  = 0 or  always become

global minima of v g+gh

e + v f

e. on the other hand v ad

e has global minima at  = /2, 3/2

8

at which su(2) symmetry is broken. thus to judge whether there appears another local

minimum to break su(2) lower than the ones at  = 0 or , it is useful to calculate the

second derivative of ve at  = 0 or . if su(2) starts to break at some number of nf and

nad, the second derivative at  = 0 or  is expected to vanish for such pair of numbers.

for a specic case of d = 4, the calculated second derivatives are found to behave as,

2v d=4

 nf  8nad + 4

 2  nf  4nad

(21)

(22)

where we used f 

4 (0) = 2/6, f 

4 () = 2/12. thus the conditions nf  8nad + 4 = 0 or

2  nf  4nad = 0 give critical numbers for nf and nad. in this way, the breaking pattern

of su(2) for given nf and nad is known to be,

su(2)  


su(2)
u(1)
su(2)

for
nf  2  4nad
for 2  4nad < nf < 8nad  4
for 8nad  4  nf

(23)

it is quite interesting to note the fact that when equality is satised in (23), not only

su(2) symmetry is restored, but also the second derivative of gauge potential is exactly

0, which means that the higgs scalar, as extra gauge boson, has vanishing mass for an

arbitrary l, even in the model on s1.

2.2.1 d = 5, d = 6 case

mine the symmetry breaking pattern for d = 5 and d = 6 cases. for d = 5

we thus have found that in both cases, gauge symmetry breaking and its restoration

occur, though the critical values of (nf, nad) are dierent.

2.3 su(3) case

we take the parameterization of the background su(3) gauge eld as 

hayigl = diag(1, 2, (1 + 2)).

the case when su(3) is exact and not broken is realized for

hayigl = diag(0, 0, 0),

hayigl = diag(2/3, 2/3, 4/3) and its permutations.

the symmetry breaking of su(3) into su(2)u(1) is achieved provided

(26)

(27)

(28)

hayigl = diag(0, , ) and its permutations,

(29)

or generally,

hayigl = diag(, , 2) ( 6= 2 mod 2) and its permutations.

(30)

the contribution of each sector to ve is shown in figure 2.

we can see that v g+gh

e + v f

e does not have a minima at  =  = 0 for suciently large

nf, and ve has global minima at the points such as (1, 2) = (2/3, 2/3), as pointed

out by hosotani[5]. such points (1, 2) = (0, 0), (2/3, 2/3) are all su(3) symmetric.

on the other hand, v ad

e has minima at other points, for example at (1, 2) = (0, 2/3),,

where su(3) symmetry is broken.

our main interest here is whether the breaking su(3)su(2)u(1) is possible. such

study will be helpful when we apply the method to more realistic gut theories, where

we can also take another parameterization such as haigl = 13 + 28 where i are gell-manns 

matrices. but the following discussion does not depend on the choice of parameterization.

partial breaking like su(5)su(3)su(2)u(1) is favored. when nad = 1 and nf = 3,

ve seems to have minima at (1, 2, (1 + 2)) = (0, , ) and its permutations(figure

3). to know where is global minimum, evaluating the hessian of ve:

hve (1, 2; nad, nf)i,j 

2ve(1, 2; nad, nf)

ij

,

(31)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)1,2

and its eigenvalues and eigenvectors is useful. by utilizing such method, we will study

how gauge symmetry breaks by changing nf for nad = 1, for brevity.

1. 0  nf < 3

for nf = 0, the minima of the potential coincides with those of v ad

e . as nf increases,

such minima move to the points, where su(2)u(1) symmetry is realized.

2. 3  nf < 9

when nf = 3, global minima are at the points (0, , ) (and its permutations). it

also should be noted that the hessian of ve exactly vanishes at such points:

det hve (0, ; nad = 1, nf = 3)  (6nad  3  nf)2|nad=1,nf =3 = 0.

(32)

it means that the mass of adjoint higgs as a curvature of the eective potential

vanishes exactly. then global minima of ve leaving from su(2)u(1) symmetric

12

points( (0, 0), (0, ), (, 0) ) move to the su(3) symmetric points (2/3, 2/3) as

nf increases, keeping su(2)u(1) symmetry.

3. 9  nf

when nf  9, global minima are at su(3) symmetric (non-trivial) points such as

(2/3, 2/3).

4. negative nf

as nf decreases, global minima move to the trivial vev such as (0, 0). when

nf  3, su(3) symmetry recovers.

2.3.1 summary

the above mentioned results can be summarized as follows:

su(3)

.

(33)

hence all possible symmetry breaking patterns turn out to be realized.

it is interesting to note that in the case of nf = 6nad  3, not only the wilson line

allows su(2)u(1) symmetry, but also all components of the hessian at su(2)u(1)

symmetric points vanish. this means that by hosotani mechanism su(3) symmetry

breaks into su(2)u(1), and at this minimum, the eective potential has no second

derivative, which again suggests that bosons remain massless.

we must make a remark by saying that we get such massless state without any ne-

tuning of parameters because equality nf  6nad + 3 = 0 is exactly satised without any

ne-tuning of parameters, as both nad and nf are discrete numbers.

2.3.2 d = 5, d = 6 cases

as was pointed out in su(2) model, the situation of symmetry breaking depends also on

the dimensionality of space-time.

dependences on the matter contents is more complicated for d = 5 or d = 6 case. for

example, in d = 5 case, det hve (2/3, 2/3) > 0 suggests that (2/3, 2/3) is at least a

local minimum of the ve. but, for nf = (108nad  81)/8, as shown in figure 4, such a

point is not the global minima. su(3) symmetry recovers for suciently large nf, though

the critical value at which su(3) symmetry recovers is more ambiguous than the d = 4

case. we see that su(3) recovers at least when nf > 4 for nad = 1 case.

symmetry recovers at least at nf = 8.

it also must be pointed out that in the d = 5, 6 cases, curvatures at su(2)u(1)

symmetric points never vanish, unlike the d = 4 case.

2.4 fd()  cos  (f2c) approximation

we found that gauge symmetry breaking depends not only on the matter contents of the

theory, but also on the dimensionalities of the space time.

it is partially because the factors 2[2/d],(d  2) depend on the dimensionality d. the

other reason is that the form of the function fd() varies for dierent d. generally, fd()

14

becomes close to cos  as d becomes large. so we can approximate fd() by cos  for

suciently large d.

by taking fd  cos (f2c, for short) approximation, we can more easily calculate and

evaluate ves for the case of su(3),d = 10.

where the critical value for su(2)u(1)  su(3) transition is got by simply comparing

the values of ve(2/3, 2/3) and ve(, ), because minima of ve cannot be realized

except at such points for (4nad  1)/2 < nf < 16nad  4.

3 discussion

in this paper, it has been shown that in the hosotani mechanism, the breaking pattern of

gauge symmetry depends on the choice of the representation of matter elds.

how the matters in the fundamental and adjoint representation contribute to the

gauge symmetry breaking has been clearly shown in the su(2) case.

by explicit calculation we have also shown in the su(3) model that we can achieve

not only breaking of su(3) gauge symmetry, but also the breaking into su(2)u(1), i.e.

partial gauge symmetry breaking, by suitably selecting the combination of nf and nad.

this feature may be very desirable in constructing more realistic gut models where

a breaking into subsymmetry with the same rank, such as su(5) su(3)su(2)u(1),

is needed. ho and hosotanis model[10] contains only adjoint matter eld and the su(n)

gauge group breaks only into u(1)n 1 in the periodic boundary condition and a nontrivial

boundary condition was required for su(5) to break into su(3)su(2)u(1).

including the desirable feature mentioned right above, our model has the following

advantages, when considered as a prototype model of gut.

15

1. our model contains fermions with fundamental representation in addition to adjoint

representation, while the models discussed by hosotani et al. have only fermions

with adjoint representation. the situation we discussed may be understood as more

realistic, since matter with fundamental representation is needed in gut anyway.

2. it should be stressed that in our model, once the representation of matter eld

is xed, there is no arbitrariness in the ve and in the breaking pattern of gauge

symmetry, whereas in ordinary gut they crucially depend on the values of many

parameters of self coupling of higgs, such as 24 representation of higgs in su(5).

we have shown that in our model the vevs of higgs (as extra space components

of gauge boson) are dynamically (and uniquely) chosen as the bottom of ve. as

the bonus we have also shown that our 4-dimensional gauge theory must live at

the at-bottom of ve, namely that the higgs does not suer from large nite

mass correction, encountered in our previous work which discussed abelian gauge

theory[1].

to construct realistic model, we must investigate models with larger gauge group, such

as su(5), and with other representations, such as 10 of su(5). moreover, compactied

manifold may be larger and more complicated one such as t n(n  2). analysis may

become somewhat more complicated. f2c approximation mentioned in this paper will

help to simplify the analysis.
