(3) constraints (3) dene dierent classical systems case coset space g/h correspond dierent foliations marsden-weinstein reduction.13 how- ever, upon quantization arbitrary numbers ki turn discrete multiples h label inequivalent quantum superselection sectors.14 implies important fact classical limit h 0 inequivalent quantum systems reduce unique classical system described (1) classically dierent systems described (3). standard viewpoint quantum physical systems play fundamental role nature corresponding 4 classical systems nature described ultimatively quantum rather classical physics. accordingly, regardless actually quantum sectors derived, solely due fact quantum theories unique classical limit, may talk inequivalent quantizations particular clas- sical system, even though quantum sectors obtained quantizing dierent classical systems. inequivalent quantum sectors legitimate physical systems, whereas among classically inequivalent systems one distinguished system (1) quantum systems reduce classical limit. constraints (3) partially second class (anomalous) care must taken quantizing. resulting quantum theories equipped induced connection10 generalized spin, i.e. equations motion coset space describe particle certain spin degrees freedom depending ki minimally coupled external yang-mills type connection. one prominent constrained physical system gauge theory, true conguration space obtained quotient ane gauge potential space gauge group. structure similar coset space structure considered refs. 5 14, interesting know something possible inequivalent quantum systems classical limit reduce given classical gauge theory. one questions address paper physical role possible parameter labels quantum sectors. method inequivalent quantizations applied yang-mills theory, new constraints (3) turn correspond modied gauss laws general, see context also refs. 15 16. however, contrary case homogeneous spaces, number legitimate modications possible, general eld dependent anticipated ref. 5. among possible modications pick 5 simple one. result, modied gauss laws induce non-dynamical charges. upon quantization yang-mills theory charges become quantized describe topologically distinct eld congurations. organization paper follows. order apply ideas yang- mills theory must aware relevant conguration space longer coset type g/h base space c/g principal bundle, c total space connections, structure group given gauge group g. (more precisely, must restrict c dense set irreducible connections since otherwise group action non-free.) thus, briey mentioned ref. 6, generalized dirac quantization must set principal bundles, main task next section. third section, geometric structures gauge orbit space claried compared nite dimensional case, upon actual quantization carried out. last section discusses results hints developments. 2 particle principal bundle section extract refs. 5 6 mathematical structures essential inequivalent quantizations yang-mills system and, order adapt geometrical setting, consider classical point particle moving principal bundle. although physical system already known literature,11,13,17,18 fol- lowing presentation diers appeared hitherto kept simple possible and, furthermore, allow direct conversion yang- mills system next section. let g semisimple lie group, lie algebra, denoted l(g), 6 possesses non-degenerate metric tr(rs), r, l(g), dened multiple trace function certain irreducible matrix representation. let p principal bundle structure group g basemanifold b consider following g-invariant lagrangian l = 1 2 g u u v (u) = 1 2 g( u, u) v (u) , (4) u tup velocity particle, v (u) g g-invariant potential metric, respectively. thus, v (u) = v (u) r g = g, g r denotes pull-back dened right group action r(u) = u. hamiltonian corresponding (4) reads h = 1 2 g(p, p) + v (u) , (5) p particle momentum g equation stands inverse metric cotangent space u p . follows identify cotangent space tangent space via metric, mechanical system point particle phase space tangent bundle p . technical issue really essential introduced make application inequivalent quantizations yang-mills theory next section transparent. xed phase space hamiltonian dene symplectic structure tangent bundle p . consider cotangent bundle canonical 1-form 0 = pdu canonical symplectic structure 0 := d0 derived it. pull back symplectic 2-form 0 via metric tangent bundle. thus symplectic 2-form reads = d, pull-back 0 given = gpdu .

(10) (11) (12) turning back mechanics, recover dynamics particle base b, employ dirac constraints12 accordance ref. 5. introduce constraints (8) ra = 0 , {ra, rb} = fab c rc (13) (14) structure constants fab c. thus ra build system rst class constraints consistent hamiltonian, {ra, h} = 0, since momentum maps conserved quantities. however, salient point recovered ref. 5 analysis mackeys inequivalent quantizations procedure, stringent reason restrict constraints (13) free introduce (at rst place) arbitrary element k lie algebra replace (13) ra tr(tak) = ra ka = 0 , 9 (15) formally modied constraints employed mcmullan tsutsui homogeneous space. details physical motivation led modied constraints may found ref. 5. note reductions physical system via modied constraints (15) corrospond marsden-weinstein reductions.13,11,17,18 let us remark general principal bundle modied constraints (15) possibility. fact modication do, provided reduces one considered ref. 5 homogeneous space. restriction applies long base considerations mackeys work. thus full content idea inequivalent quantizations is, insofar classical reduction part considered, general marsden-weinstein reduction considered above. another natural modication (13) matching condition (p tup ) ra(p) g(ta +, k +) = j(ta)(p k +) = 0 . (16) reason disregard possibility k-term base point de- pendent general thus leads complication constraint algebra. shall turn quantization modied constrained system. following discussion quantization presented refs. 5 6 great detail therefore kept brief. new constraints (15) rst class, since poisson bracket two expressed constraints alone acquires additional term tr k. term vanishes one generators lies kernel adjoint map adk. thus (15) contains rst class subset given = j(ts) trtsk = rs ks = 0 , 10 (17) ts chosen span ker(adk) =: sk, decomposes sk = tc, cartan subalgebra containing k c possible orthogonal complement k regular semisimple. let sk denote lie subgroup g generated sk. constraints (17) second class, constrained system remains gauge symmetry respect sk-transformations. introduce gauge xing conditions functions = s(u, p) = 0 . (18) new system quantized path-integral method. order path integrate hamiltonian (5) phase space, take account rst class constraints (17), second class constraints (15), also gauge xings. denoting dierent constraints k obtain z = z 0 n (k) det = z dpdu(y det g) (k) det 1 2|{k, k}|exp(cid:18) h (z 0 hdt)(cid:19) (19) 1 2|{k, k}|exp(cid:18) h (z dt g(p, u) h)(cid:19) (20) rst path-integral (19) written cotangent bundle p using n time canonical 1- product canonical liouville form 0 n usually written simply dpdu, form 0. note measure q 0 p u canonical variables. second expression (20) dened tangent bundle p , determinant metric comes owing change variable p = gp. note = gpdu = gp udt. 11 explained ref. 5, certain choice form gauge xing conditions (18), possible integrate momentum. one actually implement constraints (15). concerning calculation note briey done decomposing momentum p velocity u via projection (9) corresponding vertical horizontal components, whereupon vertical projection (p) (9) momentum p entirely replaced expression k. finally, following path-integral conguration space obtained z = z du detg (s)det|{s, s}| exp(cid:18) h z ltot dt(cid:19) , (21) total lagrangian sum original lagrangian (4) projected onto base space b additional terms linear quadratic k, ltot = 1 2 g( v, v) v (u) + tr(k( w)) 1 2 kakbab . (22) expression v w denote horizontal resp. vertical velocity com- ponents. thus original lagrangian part consisting rst two terms may projected base space b yielding lb = 1 2 gb( x, x) v (x), metric gb b dened original metric g acting horizontal lift x b. last quadratic casimir-expression (cf. refs. 6 10 also function base b, since ab g-invariant. k-linear term depending vertical bre velocity w via connection 1-form (10) gauge-dependent. let us calculate change additional term sk-transformation. let u 7 us sk-transformation, written = ertr eptp help bases {tr} {tp} c orthogonal decomposition sk = c. taking account dening properties connection, gauge change ltot calculated total time derivative only, ltot = lk = dt tr(k) , 12 (23) implies sk-symmetry classical level. quantum sk-symmetry theory hand requires path-integral (21) indepent gauge xing. case paths related gauge transformation contribute path-integral amplitude. requirement stronger classical one (23) leads quantization k: consider path u(t), , (21). gauge related paths contributing transition u(0) u(t ) given us(t) = u(t)s(t) , s(t) sk , s(0) = s(t ) = 1 . (24) amplitude us(t) diers u(t) phase given = 1 h z 0 dt ltot = 1 h tr (k ((t ) (0))) . (25) sk-symmetry thus requires 2z. together periodicity prop- erty sk, r(t ) r(0) 2z implies component k r k must quantized multiples h, labelling inequivalent quantizations.5 mentioned already introduction, note that, since components k r k discrete multiples h,14 become zero classical limit. thus, al- though inequivalent quantum systems obtained quantizing dierent classical systems, correspond dierent foliations marsden-weinstein reduction,11 according philosophy explained introduction view quantum systems inequivalent quantizations classical system quantum sectors reduce classical limit. 13 inequivalent quantizations considered far physical interest quan- tizing classical system given topologically non-trivial conguration space b. one seeks principal bundle structure p total space tractable quan- tization. example base space simply connected, one try rst quantization universal covering. works, then, besides canonical quantization b, automatically obtain series inequivalent quantum sys- tems. may considered result non-trivial topology base space. quantization method discussed far however suers arbitrariness geometry chosen p , especially form metric employed. thus order procedure real interest geometric structure p must arises naturally mathematical physical setting. example case lie group g homogeneous space g/h considered refs. 5 6 metric g given adg-invariant one. follows shall consider gauge theories. case base conguration space, quotient ane space connection forms gauge transformation group, complex topology contrast ane total space, natural metric chosen. 3 yang-mills system section apply inequivalent quantizations method gauge theory. simplicity take structure group g su(n). well known action gauge group makes space connections principal bundle.20,21 precisely, paper consider gauge potentials r , r denotes 14 time coordinate 3-sphere. topology spacetime may arise e.g. gauge elds dened minkowski spacetime r4 fall space-like innity fast enough considered elds r . also, following discussion general cases arbitrary closed 3-manifold may treated analogously. let p principal g-bundle c := {a = aidxi |i = 1, 2, 3} space irreducible space-component connection 1-forms. let g denote gauge group time-independent gauge transformations, sections adjoint group bundle dened p ad g. action g c makes principal g-bundle orbit space.21 space c ane space natural metric determined space components spacetime metric killing metric structure group: let adp adjoint vector bundle dened p ad l(g), structure group g acts lie algebra l(g) adjoint representation. canonical non-degenerate positive metric dened space adp -valued m-forms, = m() adp , (, ) = z tr( ) = z 1 m! 1 1 g d3x , (26) denotes hodge operator g stands determinant metric. since tangent space point c space 1 adp -valued 1-forms, eq.
