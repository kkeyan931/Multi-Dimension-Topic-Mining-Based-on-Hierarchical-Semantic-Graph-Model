we study the eect of a background ux string on the vacuum energy of massive dirac fermions
in 2+1 dimensions conned to a nite spatial region through mit boundary conditions. we treat
two admissible self-adjoint extensions of the hamiltonian and compare the results. in particular,
for one of these extensions, the casimir energy turns out to be discontinuous at integer values of
the ux.

i. introduction

in a by now classic paper, y. aharonov and d. bohm [1] pointed out that a locally trivial vector potential can,
however, give rise to observable eects in a nontrivial topology. since then, the relevance of aharonov-bohm scenarios
both in particle physics and condensed matter was recognized.

more recently, much attention has been paid to the inclusion of spin, mainly in connection with the interaction
of cosmic strings with matter [26]. in this context, the need to consider self-adjoint extensions of the radial dirac
hamiltonian was understood [7,8].

thereafter, the vacuum properties of dirac elds in the background of a singular [914] as well as extended [15,16]
magnetic ux string have been extensively studied. scalar eld and the electromagnetic eld have been considered as
well; some pertinent references are [1720].

as is well known, the presence of background elds modies the energy spectrum, thus giving rise to a nontrivial
vacuum, or casimir, energy [21,22]. furthermore, the casimir energy is altered by the presence of boundaries, and
the consequent imposition of boundary conditions on the quantum elds. for dirac elds, many examples of both
situations have been studied in the literature (see, for instance, [16,2325]).

in particular, the combined eect of a classical magnetic uxon and mit boundary conditions on the vacuum energy
of a massless dirac eld in 2+1 dimensions was treated in [26]. there, one of the possible self-adjoint extensions of
the radial hamiltonian was considered.

in this paper, we will consider the more realistic case of massive fermions.

in this context, it is important to
mention that, despite general belief, in the presence of curved boundaries the eect of a mass is not exponentially
small [27] as it is for parallel plates [22]. on the contrary, in some situations it might even lead to a sign change in
the casimir force and is by no means negligible [27]. in the present context, we will see that properties like existence
of a minimum or continuity of the casimir energy as a function of the ux depend on the mass which underlines
its crucial importance. moreover, we will analyze two possible self-adjoint extensions, both known to be compatible
with the presence of a dirac delta magnetic eld at the origin [28]. the resulting casimir energies are quite dierent
showing that the one-parameter family of self-adjoint extensions describes nontrivial physics in the core, see also [8].

the organization of the paper is as follows.
in sec. ii we summarize the generalities of the model.
in sec. iii, we present a discussion of self-adjoint extensions distinguished by the behaviour of the wave function at
the origin. we determine the energy eigenfunctions corresponding to two dierent cases of these extensions. the rst
one is a minimal divergence extension. as shown in [23,24], it arises when imposing atiyah-patodi-singer boundary
conditions [2934] at a nite radius, then shrinked to zero (an idea rst suggested in [35]). the second one follows
from the zero radius limit of a cylindrical ux shell [2,5,6].

in sec. iv, the implicit equations for the energy spectrum are found in both cases, once the theory is conned to
a circle of radius r and mit conditions (see, for instance, [36] and references therein) are imposed at the exterior
boundary. the expression of the casimir energy for both types of behaviour at the origin is given in the framework
of the -function regularization [3740].

in sec. v, we evaluate the vacuum energies, following the methods developed in [26,4143,27].
finally, sec. vi contains a discussion of the results.

we study the dirac equation for a massive particle in 2 + 1 dimensional minkowski space

ii. setting of the problem

in the presence of a ux string located at the origin, i.e.,

(i 6  6a  m)  = 0

~h = ~  ~a =


r

(r)ez ,

(1)

(2)

where  = 

2 is the reduced ux.

we assume the ux string to be radially symmetric; so, a gauge can be chosen such that the (covariant) vector

potential is given by

a (r) = 


r

,

for

r > 0 .

we will consider the chiral representation for the dirac matrices

0 = 3  3,

1 = i3  2,

2 = i3  1,

which, together with

give a closed cliord algebra.

then, the eigenvalue equation for the dirac hamiltonian takes the form

3 = i2  0 ,

where the two-by-two blocks are given by

(cid:18) h+ 0

0 h (cid:19) e = e e ,

h =(cid:18) m l

l m (cid:19) ,

(notice that these two polarizations correspond to the two inequivalent two by two irreducible representations of

iii. behaviour at the origin

as is well known [2,7,8], the radial dirac hamiltonian in the background of an aharonov-bohm gauge eld requires
a self-adjoint extension for the critical subspace n = . in fact, imposing regularity of all components of the dirac eld
at the origin is too strong a requirement, except for integer ux. rather, one has to apply the theory of von neumann
deciency indices [44], which leads to a one-parameter family of allowed boundary conditions [8], characterized by

i lim

2 (cid:19) .

(11)

here,  parameterize the admissible self-adjoint extensions of h respectively. which of these extensions to choose
depends on the physical situation under study.
throughout this paper we will, for non-integer , consider two dierent behaviours at the origin. the rst one,

from now on called behaviour i, is characterized by

 =(cid:26)  

2

2

for a  1
2
for a < 1
2

.

(12)

as shown in refs. [23,24], this is the extension arising when boundary conditions of the atiyah-patodi-singer (aps)

type [2934] are imposed at a nite radius, then taken to zero.

the second self-adjoint extension we will consider, from now on called behaviour ii, corresponds to

 =(cid:26)  

2

2

for  > 0
for  < 0

.

(13)

as shown in ref. [5], this extension arises when a nite radius ux tube is considered, thus asking for continuity of

the components of the spinor, and then shrinking the radius to zero.

outside the critical subspace, the eigenfunctions in eq. (10) are determined by the requirement of square integra-

bility at the origin, and are thus identical for the behaviours i and ii. they are given by

(15)

(16)

(17)

it is easy to see that this extension satises the condition of minimal irregularity (the radial functions diverge as
2 ). moreover, it is compatible with periodicity in , a natural requirement when the

r  0 at most as rp, with p  1
origin is an excluded point.

when behaviour ii is imposed at the origin, the eigenfunctions in the critical subspace are given by eq. (16) for

 > 0, and by eq. (17) for  < 0.

it is worth pointing out that, for integer  = , both aps boundary conditions and the nite radius ux tube lead,

when taking the singular limit, to the requirement of regularity of all components at the origin. in this case

iv. the theory in a bounded region. energy spectrum and casimir energy

from now on, we will conne the dirac elds inside a bounded region, by introducing a boundary at r = r, and

imposing there mit bag boundary conditions.

the casimir energy is formally given by

ec = 

1

2 xe>m

e  xe<m

e! ,

(19)

where  represents all indices appearing in the eigenvalue equation that arises after local mit conditions are imposed.
in doing so, one must consider a boundary operator b which, with the representation of the dirac matrices given in
eq. (4), is also block-diagonal, and can be written as

b = 1  i 6 n = 1 + i(1n1 + 2n2) =(cid:18) b+ 022

022 b (cid:19) ,

where n is the exterior normal, and

b =(cid:18) 1 iei

(cid:19) .

(20)

(21)

consider, in the rst place, behaviour i (ii) for a  1/2 ( > 0). then, the eigenvalue equations for the upper (+)

polarization are

jn+a(kr) =

e  m
jna(kr) = k
e  m

jn1+a(kr)

for n = 1, ...,,

jn+1a(kr)

for n = 1, ..., ,

coming from non-critical subspaces, and

which comes from the critical one.

the eigenvalue equations corresponding to the lower () polarization are

ja(kr) =

e  m

ja1(kr) ,

jn+a(kr) = k

jn1+a(kr)

for n = 1, ...,,

e + m

jn+1a(kr)

for n = 1, ..., ,

from non-critical subspaces, and

ja(kr) = k
e + m

ja1(kr) ,

which comes from the critical one.

for a < 1/2 ( < 0), the contributions from non-critical subspaces are the same, while those due to n =  are

for the upper polarization, and

ja(kr) = k
e  m

j1a(kr) ,

ja(kr) =

e + m

j1a(kr) ,

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

for the lower one.

it is easy to verify that positive energies coming from one polarization correspond to negative energies coming from

the other. thus, both polarizations give identical contributions to the casimir energy in eq. (19).

then, the formal expression for the casimir energy (19) is

where the ks are solutions of

ec =

(31a)

(31b)

when a  1/2 ( > 0) while, for a < 1/2 ( < 0), the rst equation in (31) holds for n = 1, ..., and the second one
applies for n = 0, ...,.

of course, a regularization method must be introduced in order to give sense to the divergent sum in eq. (30). in

the framework of the -regularization [37,38] (for several applications see [39,40]),

ec =

here, it is useful to dene the so-called partial zeta function

so, after introducing  = n + 1

for any a, as

from eq. (35) it is clear that, as mentioned before, the casimir energy for a behaviour of type i at the origin
is independent of the integer part  of the reduced ux. moreover, it is invariant under    (a  1  a).
thus, it is enough to study it for 0 <  < 1
2 , where the absolute value in the last term can be ignored, and to use
c () = ei
ei
similarly, from eq. (36), the casimir energy for behaviour ii is seen to be invariant under   . thus we only

study the case  > 0, where the last term is again  1

v. evaluation of the casimir energy

the casimir energies in eqs. (35) and (36) contain two contributions: the term inside the square brackets, which

is summed over , and the last term, which is a partial zeta function.

in both cases, it is useful to introduce, as in references [26,41,42], an integral representation for the partial zeta

function:

where

(s) = 2

f(x) = i 2

i(x)i1(x) ,

(37)

(38)

which have to be summed according to eqs. (35) and (36). here, the dimensionless variable z = mr has been
introduced.

in order to identify the divergences and evaluate the nite parts of the terms in eqs. (35) and (36) an analytical
continuation of the zeta function (s) to s =  1
2 has to be constructed. a method to do this has been developed
in [43] and for details of the procedure we refer to this reference. for the part of the zeta functions involving the
angular momentum sum the method consists of adding and subtracting several orders of the uniform debye expansion
of eq. (38) such as to make the sum as well as the integral in eqs. (35), (36) and (37) well dened in an increasing
strip of the complex s-plane. for the partial zeta function, instead, subtracting and adding the asymptotic terms for
large arguments of the bessel functions will be sucient.

let us rst study the terms summed over . by making use of the recurrence relations for bessel functions, it is

immediate to obtain

in order to make the integral in eq. (41), and the subsequent sum over , absolutely convergent at s =  1

2 , it is
necessary to take n  2 [43]. we will choose n = 4 to improve the convergence of the sum of the analytic term (41),
thus decreasing the computational time needed to get accurate numerical results.
now, the term in square brackets in eqs. (35) and (36) involves the combination +(s) + (s). in order to use

which is independent of the ux. thus, the dierence between casimir energies with arbitrary and integer ux is
nite and contains the relevant information about the eect of the ux.

in fig. 1, we plot the dimensionless dierence ed = r (ec (a)  ec (0)) for a behaviour of type i at the origin, as a
function of a (the fractionary part of the reduced ux), for dierent values of z. since the nite part of the casimir
energy is continuous in a, the dierence goes to zero both at a = 0 and a = 1. it shows a minimum at a = 1
2 . it
is interesting to note, that around a = 0, the vacuum energy decreases when the ux grows and that this eect is
enhanced with increasing mass.

for a type ii behaviour at the origin, the same dierence is plotted in fig. 2. with decreasing mass our curves tend
to the m = 0 result of ref. [26] and already z = 1
128 shows quite a good agreement with the corresponding gure in
that reference (except for a factor of 2, due to the fact that only one polarization was considered by the authors of
[26]).

whereas for small values of the mass the energy exhibits a minimum at a 6= 0, for larger values of m this minimum
is shifted towards a = 0. furthermore, for m 6= 0 a nonzero value is seen to arise for a  0+. this is due to the
discontinuous behaviour of the nite part of the vacuum energy, more precisely of the contribution of the critical
subspace, at integer values of the ux.

the origin of this discontinuity can be traced back to the appearance, for a  0+, of a root of the combination of
bessel functions involved in the partial zeta a. such a root is absent when a = 0. for a  0+, this root goes to zero
and, thus, gives rise to a gap, which equals m. the quantity j 2
k ja(kr)ja1(kr) is shown in
fig. 3 as a function of kr, for various values of a in order to clarify this discontinuous behaviour.
in summary, we have seen that the presence of the mass as well as the choice of the self-adjoint extension of the
hamiltonian have a considerable inuence on the dependence of the casimir energy of the ux. we have analyzed and
discussed in detail the behavior of the casimir energy as a function of the parameters, namely ux and mass. as a
consequence of the mass, in the case of the self-adjoint extension, (13), a discontinuity of the energy is found. it would
be interesting to see how this eect comes about, starting with the nite radius ux [5] and shrinking the radius to
zero. does the eect persist or it is only a result of the singular vortex? furthermore, one should try to understand
better the physical meaning of the dierent self-adjoint extensions by considering how the casimir energy depends
on the parameter  of the one-parameter family of self-adjoint extensions. finally, more realistic (3 + 1)-dimensional
calculation should be envisaged.

here we are going to provide all analytical properties of the functions f (s; a, b; x) dened in eq. (51).
as in ref. [25], we will make use of

h() =z 
x(cid:1)2(cid:17)t

when applied to h() = a(cid:16)1 +(cid:0)

now, we are interested in f (s; a, b; x), for arbitrary b. from the denition, it is clear that f (s; a, b; x) = f (s +
in order to avoid such

b, a, 0; x). however, as b grows, the integrals in eq. (b2) eventually diverge at u = 1.
divergences, we will perform an adequate number of integrations by parts, thus obtaining

however, the number of integrations by parts is bounded by the requirement that the integrated terms are well-
behaved at u = 0. in what follows, we will thus keep the number of integrations admissible, by making use of the
following recurrence relationship

f (s; a, b; x) = f (s; a, b  1; x) 

1
x2 f (s; a + 2, b; x) .

(b5)

in this way, all the required functions can be reduced to four dierent cases
 f (s; 2n, n; x), f (s; 2n, n + 1
 f (s; 2n + 1, n; x), f (s; 2n + 1, n + 1

2 ; x), n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

2 ; x), n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 .
