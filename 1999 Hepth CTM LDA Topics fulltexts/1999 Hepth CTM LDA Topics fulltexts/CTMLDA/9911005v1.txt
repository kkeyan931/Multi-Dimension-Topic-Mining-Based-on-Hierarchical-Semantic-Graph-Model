abstract

it is shown that three-dimensional charged black holes can approach the extreme

state at nonzero temperature. unlike even dimensional cases, the entropy for the

extreme three-dimensional charged black hole is uniquely described by the bekenstein-

hawking formula, regardless of dierent treatments of preparing the extreme black

hole, namely, hawkings treatment and zaslavskiis treatment.

there has been recently a great deal of interest in the study of the extreme black hole

(ebh) entropy. the interest was rst heated up by the ndings that the four-dimensional

(4d) reissner-nordstrom (rn) ebh and the non-extreme black hole (nebh) are dierent

objects due to their drastically dierent topological properties and rn ebh has zero entropy

regardless of its nonzero horizon area [1,2]. however, using the grand canonical ensemble,

zaslavskii argued that a 4d rn black hole in a nite size cavity can approach the extreme

state as closely as one likes and the bekenstein-hawking formula is still expected to hold for

rn ebh [3]. the geometrical and topological properties were also claimed of nonextreme

sectors [4,5]. support for this view is also provided by state-counting calculations of certain

extreme and near-extreme black holes in string theory, see [6] for a review. these dierent

results indicate that ebhs have a special and controversial role in black hole thermodynamics

and topologies.

comparing [1,2] and [3-5], it seems that the clash comes from two dierent treatments:

one refers to hawkings treatment by starting with the original ebh [1,2] and the other

zaslavskiis treatment by rst taking the boundary limit and then the extreme limit to get

the ebh from its nonextreme counterpart [3-5]. recently by using these two treatments, the

geometry and intrinsic thermodynamics have been investigated in detail for a wide class of

ebhs including 4d and two-dimensional (2d) cases [7-10]. it was found that these dierent

treatments lead to two dierent topological objects represented by dierent euler charac-

teristics and show drastically dierent intrinsic thermodynamical properties both classically

and quantum-mechanically. based upon these results it was suggested that there maybe two

kinds of ebhs in the nature: the rst kind suggested by hawking et al with the extreme

topology and zero entropy, which can only be formed by pair creation in the early universe;

on the other hand, the second kind, suggested by zaslavskii, has the topology of the nonex-

treme sector and the entropy is still described by the bekenstein-hawking formula, which

can be developed from its nonextreme counterpart through second order phase transition

[11-13]. this speculation has been further conrmed recently in a hamiltonian framework

[14] and the grand canonical ensemble [15] as well as canonical ensemble [16] formulation

for rn anti-de sitter black hole.

all these results available for ebhs entropy are limited to even dimensions. whether

these results can be extended to odd dimensions is unclear. this paper evolves from an

attempt to study this problem by using (2+1)-dimensional (3d) charged black hole as an

2

example.

the metric of the 3d charged black hole reads [17]

where

ds2 = n 2dt2 + n 2dr2 + r2d2

n 2 = m +

with  < t < +, 0 < r <  and 0    2, m and  in the above metric associated
respectively with the mass and the charge of the black hole, l2 is the negative cosmological
constant and r0 is a constant. when r > r0, the 3d charged black hole is described by the

penrose diagram as usual[18]. the electric potential of the charge is

a0(r) =  ln

r
r0

.

this black hole has two, one, or no horizons, depending on whether [19]

(3)

is greater than, equal to or less than zero, respectively.

now we can directly make use of the approach of [20] to study the black hole thermo-

dynamics in a grand canonical ensemble where we consider the black hole in a cavity with

radius rb. the temperature on the boundary of the cavity is tw = th /n (rb), where

th = k/2 is the hawking temperature and k is the surface gravity.

for our metric (1), the local temperature has the form

tw =

th =

l2 ), according
when a black hole approaches the extreme state (m =
to (6) th  0. the simplest choice is to take the limit tw  0. one might refer to
the third law of thermodynamics to argue that the ebh cannot be achieved because the

however, it is interesting to point out that although th  0, the square root in (5) tends
to zero as well if we take r+  rb, thus the extreme state with nonzero local temperature

3

does exist. indeed, taking r+ and r as corresponding to event horizon and cauchy horizons,

we have

2 =

2(r2
+  r2
)
l2 ln(r+/r)

,

(7)

and we can readily see that although th has a simple zero in r+  r, the expression in
the square-root in the denominator of tw has a double-zero, i.e.,

 m +

(8)

therefore tw tends to a constant value in the ebh case. recall that in the grand canonical

ensemble, only the temperature on the boundary has physical meaning, whereas th can

always be rescaled without changing observable quantities [21]. therefore analogous to the

4d rn case [3], there exists a well dened extreme state of the 3d charged black hole in the

grand canonical ensemble and no contradiction with the third law arise.

now it is of interest to investigate whether two dierent treatments applied in even

dimensions will lead to similar dierent entropy results for 3d charged ebh. the action for

the euclidean version of the 3d charged black hole on a 3d manifold m with a boundary is

given by

i = 

1

2 zm

d3xg(r + 2/l2 + 1/4ff  ) +

1

 zm

d2x(k  k0)

(9)

here  is the induced metric on the boundary m and k is the extrinsic curvature of the

boundary. k0 is a constant independent on the metric of 3d spacetime and we choose it to

be zero to normalize the thermodynamic energy in a at spacetime.

introducing the gaussian normal coordinates near every point on the surface of the

cavity, the timelike coordinate of this system is the proper time  for an observer on the
surface and the coordinates on the surface are (, ). dening ~n as the unit spacelike vector
orthogonal to the surface and ~u the velocity of a mass element of this surface, the orthogonal

condition becomes

~n  ~u = 0

(10)

the velocity is ~u = tt + rr where the overdot denotes dierentiation with respect to
 . we obtain ~n = (|gtt|)1 rt + |gtt| tr from eq(10). the normalization conditions are
~n  ~n = 1, ~u  ~u = 1. the extrinsic curvatures relative to the gaussian normal coordinates

taking the boundary limit r+  rb, (nrb  0), we nd

s = 4r+

(15)

(16)

(17)

this is just the entropy for the 3d charged nebh [17]. we note that the rst term in (16)

does not contribute to the entropy, which is similar to the even dimensional cases, where

the entropy result is only attributed to the surface term of the euclidean action.

we are now in position to extend the above calculations to ebh. we are facing two limits,

namely, the boundary limit r+  rb and the extreme limit m =
we follow two dierent treatments while taking these two limits: (a) rst take the boundary

limit and then the extreme limit, which corresponds to the treatment adopted in [3-5]; and

5

(b) rst take the extreme limit and then the boundary limit, which corresponds to starting

with the original ebh in [1,2]. from eq.(14), it is easy to nd that both the rst term and

the third term in the free energy will vanish either in treatment (a) or (b) due to the limit
r+  rb. therefore only the second term of the free energy has the contribution to the
entropy in these two treatments. using (15), we have

these two dierent ways of taking the limits lead to the same entropy for 3d charged ebh,

and entropy never vanishes. this result can also be extended to 3d rotating black hole.

thus we have shown that in the grand canonical ensemble, the 3d charged black hole

can approach the extreme state at nonzero temperature. unlike even dimensional cases, the

entropy of the 3d charged ebh is uniquely described by the bekenstein-hawking formula

regardless of the dierent ways of taking the limits.

as a matter of fact, in even dimensions it is usual to classify the topology of the manifold

in terms of the chern class, in dimensions multiple of four also by the pontryagin number.

the problem of the black hole entropy has been generally related to the euler characteristic

of the manifold, rather useful in the context of general relativity due to the gauss-bonnet

theorem. thus, for even dimensional nebhs and ebhs, there are direct relations between

the black hole entropy and the topological properties represented by euler characteristics

obtained from gauss-bonnet theorem [22,23,24,25,2,8-11]. in odd dimensional space-time

the situation is much more dicult, since most of the tradicional topological invariants do not

exist, in spite of the fact that the topology may be far from trivial. in three dimensions, in

particular, the gauss-bonnet theorem does not exist, and the relations between the entropies

and topologies either in nebh or ebh valid in even dimensions are not appropriate. as far

6

as the traditional invariants are concerned, our result is compatible with having the same

topology for both, the extreme and non-extreme black holes in three dimensions, thus we nd

no contradiction when the extreme limit is taken. however, for more general congurations

we certainly need a ner analysis. we can say that the relation between the entropy result

and their topological properties in odd dimensions is still unclear and needs further study.
