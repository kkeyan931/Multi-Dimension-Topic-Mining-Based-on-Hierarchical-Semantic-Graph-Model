abstract

we examine the issue of high energy scattering in generic d-dimensional quantum
eld theories admitting an ultraviolet xed point. we nd that the total cross
section behaves asymptotically as s1d/2(a + b/s), with   (d  x)/2, x
being the scaling dimension of the least relevant operator responsible for the
renormalisation group ow.

the set of ideas which commonly goes under the name of renormalisation group (rg)
provided us with a new global insight into quantum eld theory.
it shows that a
quantum eld theory is associated with a trajectory in a space of coupling constants,
dierent points along the trajectory being related by a sequence of rg transformations
and corresponding to the description of the theory at dierent distance scales [1]. in
the extreme ultraviolet limit in which distances are innitely smaller than any intrinsic
length scale, the theory is expected to become scale invariant, and the corresponding
trajectory in the coupling constant space to end into a xed point of the rg. quite
generally, this description can be formalised by writing the action of the theory in d
dimensions in the form

where af p denotes the xed point action and i are the scalar operators responsible
for the rg ow. they are characterised by the scaling dimensions xi dened by

lim
x0hi(x)i(0)i =

1
|x|2xi

.

(2)

the index i in the action above spans a set of scaling operators which is closed under
rg transformations. since af p describes an ultraviolet xed point, the operators i
must be relevant (xi < d) or, at most, marginally relevant, in which case xi = d but
the power law behaviour in (2) is corrected by factors of ln|x| in the denominator.
this condition ensures that the coupling constants gi, which in the neighborhood of
the xed point have physical dimension massdxi, actually vanish in the ultraviolet
limit. a specic theory is identied by assigning the value of the coupling constants at
some xed scale; with this initial condition, the corresponding trajectory in coupling
space is uniquely determined by the rg equations.

it is the purpose of this note to point out some simple consequences for high energy
scattering in quantum eld theory which arise from the combination of the conceptual
framework recalled above with the basic principles of relativistic scattering theory [2].
our arguments are conveniently illustrated by considering a theory containing scalar
particles of mass m. we denote by |p1, . . . , pniin (out) an asymptotic state containing n
incoming (outgoing) particles with momenta p1, . . . , pn. a scattering process involving
k particles in the initial state and j particles in the nal state is described by the
matrix element

outhpk+1, . . . , pk+j|p1, . . . , pkiin = inhpk+1, . . . , pk+j|s|p1, . . . , pkiin ,

where s is the scattering operator. denoting by h the hamiltonian density, it can be
written as s = exp[ir ddxh(x)].

let us perform a rg trasformation which shifts the theory innitesimally along the
rg trajectory in coupling space. this involves the scale transformation x  (1+)x,
|| << 1. the response of the theory under a general coordinate transformation
x  x + x is specied by the relation

a = z ddx t(x) x ,

(4)

which denes the tensor t. since a = r ddx (2t  h) and the kinetic term r ddxt

is scale invariant, the variation of the scattering operator under the innitesimal scale
transformation is given by

s  is z ddxh() = isz ddx (x) ,

with   t 
 .

consider the elastic two-particle scattering process

+ i(2)dd(p1 + p2  p3  p4)m(s, t) ,

(6)

where s = (p1+p2)2 and t = (p1p3)2. the ratio   m2/s measures the centre-of-mass
energy in units of the physical mass scale, and can be taken as the coordinate along the
rg trajectory. the ultraviolet xed point corresponds to  = 0. under the distance
rescaling associated to our rg transformation, the mass m (inverse correlation length)
is sent into (1  )m, so that the shift along the trajectory is   2 . we are
interested in particular in the variation along the trajectory of the forward transition
amplitude m0(s)  m(s, t = 0). equation (5) gives

4 (p1, p2,p1,p2) ,
where we introduced the notation f 
n (p1, . . . , pn) = h0|(0)|p1, . . . , pniin for the n-
particle form factor of an operator , and used crossing symmetry to bring the outgoing
momenta into the in-state1. dimensional analysis and relativistic invariance require

(7)

f 
4 (p1, p2,p1,p2) = s2d/2f ( ) ,

(8)

with f ( ) dimensionless. since  = 0 at the xed point, the function f ( ) has to
vanish when  tends to zero. let us characterise this ultraviolet behaviour by writing
f ( )   , with  > 0. integration of (7) then gives
m0(s)  s2d/2(a1 + a2 ) ,

additional information about the exponent  can be obtained by investigating
the high energy behaviour of the form factors. consider for this purpose a scalar
operator  with scaling dimension x. we know from (2) that the integral iq =

r ddx|x|qh(x)(0)i is ultraviolet convergent as far as q > 2x  d. on the other

hand, we can use the lehmann representation for the correlator to obtain

iq  xn z

(10)

the positivity of all the terms of the series requires that each integral has to be ul-
traviolet convergent as long as iq is, and this clearly imposes an upper bound on the
asymptotic behaviour of the form factors. for example, it is straightforward to see
that f 

2 (p1, p2) must behave at high energies as sy with y  (x  d + 2)/2.
this result has a simple physical interpretation. nearby the xed point, f 

2 (p1, p2)
can be written as s(xd+2)/2h( ), h( ) being a dimensionless scaling function. hence
the constraint we found on y simply means that h( ) cannot diverge as   0. in
other words, there exists a nite (possibly vanishing) xed point limit for the matrix
elements. this requires in particular that f 
4 (p1, p2,p1,p2) behaves asymptotically
as sz, with z  (x/2  d + 2).

the operator (x) is a linear combination of the operators i(x) appearing in (1)
(see e.g. [4]). this follows by explicitely performing an innitesimal scale tranformation
(under which i  xii) on the action, and then comparing with (4).
in a
neighborhood of the xed point one nds (x)  pi gi(d  xi)i(x). recalling (8),
we conclude that 2  d/2   = z  x/2  d + 2, x being the largest among the xi.
as a consequence,

if  contains a marginally relevant operator j with xj = d, the exponent  is allowed
if this is the case, the parameterisation   for the ultraviolet behaviour
to vanish.
of the scaling function f ( ) is no longer suitable, and should be replaced by 1/ ln  ,
 > 0. accordingly, the term   in eq. (9) is replaced by 1/ ln1  .

the total cross section (s) is related to the forward transition amplitude m0 by
the optical theorem which is a consequence of unitarity, ss = 1. denoting by |ni
the generic n-particle state, and dening s = 1 + ir, one has

(s)  xn |hn|r|p1, p2i|2 = hp1, p2|rr|p1, p2i = ihp1, p2|r  r|p1, p2i

this result shows in particular that the total cross section is subject to the asymptotic
bound  < constant s1d/2 (possibly enhanced in the marginally relevant case by a
factor ln1 s if  < 1). for d > 2, such a constraint is more stringent than the
froissart bound  < constant lnd2 s [5] which, physically, encodes the requirement of
short range interactions only.

it is clear that considering particles with dierent masses does not aect the conclu-
sions concerning the innite energy limit. in the case of spinning particles, an average
over polarisations at the level of eq. (6) ensures that the subsequent arguments can be
carried through substantially untouched leading to the result (14) for the total cross
section of unpolarised particles.
