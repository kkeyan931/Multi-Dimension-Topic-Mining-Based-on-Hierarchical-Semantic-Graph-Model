non-zero internal gauge elds are calculated by construction of the boundary states in

spacetime in which some of its directions are compact on tori. the interaction depends

on both angle and elds.

1 introduction

a useful tool for describing branes and their interactions, specially in non-zero back-ground

elds is the boundary state [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. the overlap of boundary states through

the closed string propagator gives us the amplitude of interaction of branes. by introducing

back-ground elds to the string -model action one obtains mixed boundary conditions (i.e.

a combination of dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions) for the strings. previously we

obtained the boundary state for a stationary mixed brane (i.e. a brane in back-ground elds

). we also observed that when some directions are compactied on tori [6, 8], the winding

numbers of the emitted states around the compact directions of the brane are correlated

with their momenta along the brane. also we studied the interaction of two of these mixed

branes, in the parallel and perpendicular cases.

in this article we consider more general case of branes with respect to one another. in

particular we take two non-intersecting one-branes which make an angle  with each other in

presence of the non-zero back-ground b-eld. to keep our analysis general, we keep certain

directions compact. the correct result for the non-compact case is recovered when the radii

are take to innity.

in section 2 we obtain the boundary state for the oblique m1-brane and interaction of
two non-intersecting angled mixed branes for the bosonic part of the theory. in section 3 we

develop these, for the ns-ns and the r-r sectors of superstring theory. finally in section 4

we extract the contribution of the massless states on the interaction of the branes.

we denote a brane in the back-ground eld by mp-brane, which is a mixed brane

with dimension p.

2 the bosonic part

boundary state

previously we obtained the boundary state of a mp-brane [6]. for the m1-brane along
the x 1-direction with eld strength f01 = e, the boundary state satises the following
equations

( x 0  ex 1)0 | bx, 0i = 0 ,

( x 1  ex 0)0 | bx, 0i = 0 ,

[x i(,  )  yi]0 | bx, 0i = 0 .

in these equations the set {yi} shows the position of the m1-brane with i  {2, 3, ..., d  1}.
with equation (3) we have xed the position of the m1-brane. also 0 is the  variable on
the boundary of the closed string world sheet. now consider a m1-brane in the x 1x 2-plane,
which makes angle  with x 1-direction. for this brane, boundary state equations have the

form,

(cid:18) x 0  e cos x 1  e sin x 2(cid:19)0 | bx, 0i = 0 ,

(cid:18) cos  x 1 + sin  x 2  ex 0(cid:19)0 | bx, 0i = 0 ,

(cid:18)  (x 1  y1) sin  + (x 2  y2) cos (cid:19)0 | bx, 0i = 0 ,

(x j  yj)0 | bx, 0i = 0 ,

j 6= 0, 1, 2.

in terms of the modes x (,  ) has the form,

x (,  ) = x + 2p + 2l +

where l is zero for non-compact directions. for compact directions we have l = n r
and p = m 
r , in which n  is the winding number and m  is the momentum number of the
closed string state, and r is the radius of compactication of x -direction. suppose x 0, x 1
and x 2 to be in the set of compact directions {x c}, therefore boundary state equations
(4)-(7) in terms of the modes have the following forms,

where p = p
r) = n r. we must consider equations (23)-
(26) in summing over p0, p1 and p2 in (22). energy of the closed string state depends on
its winding numbers around the x 1 and x 2 directions. according to the equations (24)

l  p

and (25) for compact time, closed string state has non-zero momentum along the directions
x 1 and x 2. therefore its momentum numbers, along these directions (i.e. m1 and m2 )
are proportional to its winding number, around the time direction. closed string can wind
around the directions x 1 and x 2 if angle  and radii of compactication r1 and r2 are
such that the quantity r1 sin 
r2 cos  is rational, otherwise n1 = n2 = 0, i.e. closed string has no
winding around the x 1 and x 2, in this case its energy also is zero.

the ghost part of the boundary state is independent of e and angle , it is

interaction

now we can calculate the overlap of the two boundary states to obtain the interaction

amplitude of non-intersecting angled m1 and m1 branes. let m1 also be parallel to the
x 1x 2-plane with electric eld e on it, therefore boundary state that describes it, is given
by equations (22)-(26) with the change e  e , y  y and   . these mixed branes
simply interact via exchange of the closed strings, so that the amplitude is given by

a = hb1, 0 = 0 | d | b1, 0 = 0i ,

(28)

where d is the closed string propagator. in this amplitude we must use the total boundary

the set {y2, y3, ..., yd1} shows the position of m1-brane, with y2 = y1 sin  + y2 cos  and
y1 cos  + y2 sin  = 0, similarly for y2. the sets {jn} and {jc} are non-compact and compact
part of {j} , and djn is dimension of {x jn}. because of the electric elds, this amplitude is
not symmetric under the exchange     , on the other hand for angled mixed branes
 and    are two dierent congurations. from (30) we see that electric elds and
compactication of time cause y2 and y2 to appear in the interaction. for non-compact time
these disappear from the interaction, i.e. 3( |  ) = 1 , as expected. the amplitude (29) is
symmetric with respect to the m1 and m1 branes,

a(e, e, y1, y1, y2, y2, yj, yj, , ) = a(e, e, y1, y1, y2, y2, yj, yj, , )

(32)

for complex conjugation see (28). it is also independent of the compactication of directions
x 1 and x 2. for non-compact spacetime, remove all factors 3 from (29) and change jn  j
therefore djn  d  3, in this case interaction depends on the minimal distance between the
branes, that is pj(yj  yj)2. when all directions are compact, the factors containing jn
disappear, in this case jc  {3, 4, ..., d  1}.

the boundary conditions on the fermionic degrees of freedom should be imposed on both
r r and ns  ns sectors. world sheet supersymmetry requires the two sectors to satisfy
the boundary conditions,

(cid:18)(0  i 0) + e(1 + i 1)(cid:19)0 | b, , 0i = 0 ,

(cid:18)(1  i 1) + e(0 + i 0)(cid:19)0 | b, , 0i = 0 ,

(i + i i)0 | b, , 0i = 0 ,

(33)

(34)

(35)

for the m1-brane along x 1-direction [8]. the parameter  = 1 is introduced for the gso
projection. this state preserves half of the world sheet supersymmetry. for the rotated
m1-brane that makes angle  with x 1-direction, we must rotate 1 and 2, therefore we nd
the following boundary states,

| b, , 0in s = exp(cid:20)i


xr=1/2

where sa and sb are the spin elds in the 32-dimensional majorana representation. we use
a chiral representation for the 32  32 -matrices of so(1, 9) as in reference [5], therefore
we consider solution of (38) of the form

| b, i(0)

r = m()

therefore the 32  32 matrix m() obeys the following equation
(, e)11m() = 0 .

(42)

where c is the charge conjugation matrix.

the superghost part of the ns-ns sector boundary state in the (1,1) picture is

e4ir0(r

where the superghost vacuum is annihilated by 0 and 0 [10].

for both the ns-ns and the r-r sectors the complete boundary state can be written as

where q = e2t. the last line comes from the r-r sector. the factor (cos   ee) is
contribution of the fermionic zero modes, according to the sign and value of this factor, r-r

interaction is repulsive, attractive or zero. the other two terms come from the ns-ns sector.

note that determinants in the denominators come from the world sheet bosons and in the
numerators from the fermions. these determinants have the expansion like (31), that e4nt
should be changed to q2n and q2n1 . this amplitude is symmetric with respect to m1
and m1 branes. again for non-compact spacetime, in (47) remove all factors 3 and change
jn  j .

4 interaction due to the massless states

now from the interaction amplitude (47), we extract the contributions of the ns-ns and

the r-r sectors massless states, to see how distant branes interact. therefore we have the

following limits [6, 8],

[2(cos   ee)] g ,

(52)

according to the factor (cos   ee), this interaction can be attractive, repulsive or zero.
therefore distant branes have interaction amplitude a0 = a(n sn s)
. this is
proportional to the factor (cos   cos 0)2 , where

+ a(rr)

cos 0 = ee + q(1  e2)(1  e2)

,

(53)

so at  = 0, attractive force of the ns-ns sector cancels the repulsive force of the r-r
sector.

for non-compact spacetime, the function g is proportional to the greens function in

seven dimensional space, i.e.

g(nc) =

1


(2)7g7(y 2)

(54)

where y 2 is minimal distance between the branes. in this space if e = e = 0, then massless
states amplitude a0 reduces to the [11] with p = 1.

5 conclusion

we explicitly determined the boundary state for both the ns-ns and r-r sectors of su-
perstring theory, corresponding to a mixed brane parallel to the x 1x 2-plane. energy of a
closed string state emitted from this brane depends on its winding numbers around x 1 and
x 2 directions, radii of compactication of these directions and back-ground internal electric

eld. also, for compact time closed string state can have non-zero momentum along the

brane.

compactication of time and non-zero electric elds imply that interaction should depend
on the positions y2 and y2 of the branes. depending on the back-ground elds and angle
between the branes, r-r interaction is repulsive, attractive, or zero. for both of the ns-ns

and the r-r sectors, we extracted contribution of the massless states on the interaction. for

non-compact spacetime, these are proportional to the greens function of seven dimensional

space.

the formalism can be extended to include mixed branes with arbitrary dimensions p1

and p2 and more than one angle.
