abstract

we calculate gaugino masses in string-derived models with hidden-sector
gaugino condensation. the linear multiplet formulation for the dilaton super-
eld is used to implement perturbative modular invariance. the contribution
arising from quantum eects in the observable sector includes the term re-
cently found in generic supergravity models. a much larger contribution is
present if matter elds with standard model gauge couplings also couple to the
green-schwarz counter term. we comment on the relation of our kahler u (1)
superspace formalism to other calculations.

it was recently pointed out [1, 2] that the super-weyl anomaly of standard n = 1
supergravity generates a gaugino mass proportional to the beta-function coecient,
which may solve the problem of small gaugino masses found in certain classes of
models.

in this paper we consider a class of string-derived models [3][5] in which gaug-
ino condensation occurs in a hidden sector with modular invariant couplings. that
is, the eld theoretic quantum anomaly that breaks invariance under the modular
transformation (t-duality)

is explicitly canceled by a universal green-schwarz (gs) counter term together with
model-dependent string threshold corrections. gaugino masses in these models were
found in [5] to be suppressed with respect to the gravitino massalthough not as
severely as in some gauge-mediated models [6]. however, in [5] a contribution was
omitted that generates, among others, the term found in [1, 2].
in this paper we
correct this omission. the additional correction is obtained by an analysis of the
superspace expression for the loop correction, as well as by an explicit calculation
using component elds and pauli-villars regularization. in these models the anomaly
associated with the kahler transformation (1) is explicitly canceled. because kahler
and super-weyl transformations are intimately connected in the kahler u(1) super-
space formalism [7] that we use, one might expect the mass term found in [1, 2] to be
absent in this class of models. however, this term has its origin in the running of the
couplings from the string scale to the condensation scale, and is therefore independent
of the string scale physics. in addition, we nd a contribution that depends on the
unknown couplings of matter elds in the gs term  a situation similar to the case
for scalar masses discussed in [5].

in the linear supermultiplet formulation the dilaton  is the lowest component of

a vector supereld l that satises the modied linearity condition

(cid:16) d2  8r(cid:17) l = w w, (cid:16)d2  8 r(cid:17) l = w w , l(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

= ,

(2)

where the supereld r is related to elements of the supervielbein, w  is a yang-mills
supereld strength, and the summation over gauge indices is suppressed. the bianchi
identity

(cid:16)d2  24 r(cid:17) w w (cid:16) d2  24r(cid:17) w w  = total derivative

follows immediately from (2). to describe gaugino condensation [8, 9], a vector mul-
tiplet v is introduced whose components include those of a linear multiplet l as well
as chiral and anti-chiral superelds u, u that are the (anti-)chiral projections of v :

(4)

(cid:16) d2  8r(cid:17) v = u, (cid:16)d2  8 r(cid:17) v = u ,

and are interpreted as condensate superelds for a strongly coupled (conned) hidden
yang-mills sector: u  (w w)h. with this construction the supereld u has the
correct kahler u(1) weight as well as the correct constraint, that is, the counterpart
of the bianchi identity (3). this construction was generalized in [4] to the case of
several gaugino condensates, and it was found that the results are dominated by the
condensate of the gauge group ga = g+ with the largest -function coecient ba = b+,

pereld; that is, we are treating the condensate as static. a dynamical condensate
has been studied [20] in the case of an e8 gauge group, and it was found that the
bound state masses are above the condensation scale; when these states are integrated
out the theory reduces to the static case considered here.

to evaluate the gaugino masses, we set all matter elds to zero in the vacuum:
< a >=< a| >= 0. first recall that d-terms like lgs and lke can be cast in

next we explicitly calculate the gaugino masses using a pauli-villars (pv) regu-
larization that has been formulated [22] for supergravity lagrangians with the dilaton
in a chiral multiplet. for present purposes, we need only consider the regulation of
loops containing gauge-charged elds. because the results below depend only on the
kahler potential for the pv elds and their couplings to the gs term, it is straight-
forward to transcribe the analysis to the case where the dilaton is described by a
linear supermultiplet.

to regulate loop corrections to the yang-mills self-energy, one needs gauge-charged
pv chiral supermultiplets: z a with signature a, that transform under gauge trans-
formations according to representations ra; ya with the same signature that trans-
form according to the conjugate representation ra; and a
, that
transforms according to the adjoint representation of the gauge group.
in order
to cancel the logarithmic divergences in the yang-mills self-energy, the casimirs

(36)

the kahler potential for these elds takes the form (setting light gauge-charged elds

(37)

the v -dependence of kp v requires an additional term lp v = r d4efp v (v ) in the

lagrangian, where fp v is related to kp v by the dierential equation in (10) that
relates f to g:

fp v (v ) = xn

(38)

the component lagrangian can be obtained following the methods outlined in [3].
as shown in [15], supersymmetry of the modular anomaly from eld theory quantum

in agreement with the requirements for full one-loop regularization [22]. among the

the rst term in this expression is independent of the pv kahler potential  i.e., of the
eective cut-os  and of the details of the supersymmetry breaking mechanism. it is
precisely the contribution found in [1, 2]. here it arises from the presence of the kahler
potential in the condensate lagrangian (11) as dictated by local supersymmetry. as
noted previously [23], the structure of this term embeds the evolution of the gauge
coupling constant from the string scale to the condensation scale. the pv lagrangian
also contains the terms (in four-component spinor notation)

using the constraints (36), (39) and (40), this reduces to the result found in (33).

aside from the renormalization of the coupling constants, there are three contri-
butions from la in (35). the rst, proportional to b
a, gives a negligible correction to
(29). the second term modies the result (29) of [5] by a factor (neglecting b+  .03)
(47)

a  (1  ba/b+)  [0.6, 1.1, 1.8]

for ga = [su(3), su(2), u(1)] ,

if we assume just the mssm contribution to the -functions. the third term depends
on the unknown parameters pa. it was found in [5] that the squark, slepton and higgs

10

masses ms also depend on these parameters. if the matter elds decouple from the
gs term, one has

pa = 0, ms = m g,

and the full correction to the gaugino masses is given by (47).
proportional to kahler potential we get

(48)

if the gs term is

pa = b, ms  10m g.

(49)

analyses of dynamical symmetry breaking in the mssm favor smaller masses for
at least the stop and higgs particles. another possibility is that the gs term de-
pends only on the metric of the compact 6-manifold, in which case it couples only to
untwisted elds:

resulting in a mass hierarchy among generations as has been proposed by some au-
a = 2, so in this scenario,
with n untwisted generations, the last term in (35) dominates, and one gets the
following gaugino masses at the condensation scale:

(51)

finally, we address the generality of the result (34) in the broader context of
the class of string-derived models that we are considering. it would be modied if
modular invariance is broken by string nonperturbative eects, such as a moduli-
dependence of the functions g(v ), f (v ) as was found for a particular orbifold [25].
modular invariance of the eective lagrangian for the condensate ensures that the
moduli are stabilized at one of the two self-dual points in the fundamental domain:
ti = 1, ei/6. together with the condition that the vacuum energy vanishes, this
assures that their f-components vanish in the vacuum: < f i >= 0. the potential
for the moduli and the dilaton [4] is

since the term in brackets vanishes at the self-dual points, both corrections are of
order (< f i >)2, and will be small if the moduli are stabilized near the self-dual
points. moreover, the second contribution is absent in the z3, z7 orbifolds that appear
promising for model building [26]. the condition (28) provides several phenomeno-
logically desirable features [5] of our model, namely moduli masses much larger than
the gravitino mass:

m  50mti  103m g,

(54)

and a suppression of the axion decay constant by a factor of about 50 with respect to
earlier estimates [27]. moreover, the result that < f i >= 0 avoids a potential source
of unwanted avor-changing neutral currents. a detailed analysis of the phenomenol-
ogy of this class of models will be given elsewhere [21].

in concluding, we wish to emphasize that the gaugino mass contribution equal
to m0 = (g2)m g/2g2 is a model independent result in our kahler u(1) superspace
formalism, in agreement with the assertion made in [2]. in the formalism of [1], the
auxiliary eld of the supergravity multiplet diers from the eld m used here by a
weyl rotation that depends on the kahler potential. as a result, the analogous term
that they nd is not model independent; for example they get no contribution in
no-scale models [28]. in our formalism, m0 in this case is exactly canceled by the
contribution from ba in (13). consider for example the simplest no-scale model with
kahler potential

k = 3 ln(t + t xa |a|2), < a >= 0, < w >6= 0,

model.
