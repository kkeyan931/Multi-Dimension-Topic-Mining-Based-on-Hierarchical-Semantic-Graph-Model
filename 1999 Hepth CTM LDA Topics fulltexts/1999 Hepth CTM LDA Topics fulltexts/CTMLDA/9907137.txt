(6) third step relies, said, symmetry considerations. indeed, symmetry fusion rules provided presence simple currents quite useful con- struction large class modular invariant partition functions . construction simple currents solutions modular invariant partition functions reproduces diagonal (a)-like non-diagonal (d)-like series su (2) kac-moody algebra. 3 (d) series case, emphasized  opa structured following discrete cyclic symmetry z2. show analogous symmetry appears general cases consequence simple-current structure d-like series. rst, brief reminder structure simple-current symmetry. simple current (j) primary eld (chiral part) chiral fusion rules (i) give one non-vanishing fusion coecient n k ji, (j) (i) = (k) . due associativity fusion product, fusion two simple currents simple current. simple currents thus form abelian group fusion product, called center theory. since number primary elds nite rational theory, number simple currents nite. implies simple currents unipotent, i.e., must integer n jn = 1. smallest integer n property called order simple current. furthermore, rationality, must also smallest positive integer ni (j)ni (i) = (i). associativity, ni must divisor n. simple current takes eld itself, call latter xed point current. see simple current organizes primary elds orbits: {(j i) ; = 0 . . . ni}. presence simple currents conformal eld theory allows or- ganization elds orbits also expression symmetry conservation monodromy charge q (i). latter dened modulo integer expresses monodromy property (opa) (1) primary eld (i) simple current (j): q (i) hj + hi h(ji) mod 1. denition imposes monodromy charge additive operator product, i.e., q (i k) = q (i) + q (k) follows terms opa two elds must charge. consequence, non-vanishing n-point correlation function hi1i2 . . . ini. so, denote charge asso- ciated simple current j q, obviously charge associated jd equal monodromy charge must conserved (pn q (in) = q (1) = 0 mod 1) order dq, usual modulo 1. implies simple currents order n (cid:0)jn = 1(cid:1) charge equal integer, therefore q (j) r n mod 1, r dened modulo n. conservation monodromy charge means presence simple currents conformal eld theory implies center forms abelian discrete symmetry group. important fact useful order nd solutions large class modular invariant partition functions using orbifold-like method respect center. resulting modular invariant partition functions known simple-current invariants. modular invariant partition function (z =p mi,kik) called simple current invariant elds paired non-diagonally related simple currents: mi,k 6= 0 4 k = ji. case center forms cyclic center zn , i.e., one orbit simple currents (cid:8)1, j, j2, . . . , jn 1(cid:9), non-zero couplings mi,k given : mi,j ni = (7) n ni 1(cid:20)q (i) + 1 2 nq (j)(cid:21) , 1 equal one argument integer, zero otherwise. solutions (7) structured either automorphism-invariant integer-spin-invariant struc- tures combination these. rst structure, two chiral sectors (i, j) combined via automorphism fusion rules (i) = j. second structure always regarded diagonal invariant larger originally considered chiral algebra . happens current jn integer spin coupling m0,j n dierent zero hence produces holomorphic eld corresponding extra currents (noether currents) extend algebra. cyclic center zn n prime, one pure automorphism invariant q (j) 6= 0 integer invariant q (j) = 0. non-prime values n, general form modular partition function combination automorphism integer-invariant solutions. sequel, exploit operator-content structure provided forms modular-invariant partition functions n prime construction non-chiral fusion rules. conclusions straightforwardly applied non-prime values n. turn construction non-chiral fusion rules. start automorphism invariant cases. fact two chiral sectors primary eld related automorphism fusion rules makes opa structure isomorphic structure fusion rules . see this, rst consider operator content obtained (7) q (j) 6= 0. content structured sets: one see two sectors related automorphism fusion rules (i) = ic ic conjugate eld fusion operation. construct non- ak =(cid:8)(cid:0)jki, jn ki(cid:1) /q (i) = 0(cid:9) . chiral fusion rules, let us consider two elds (cid:0)jki, jn ki(cid:1) (cid:0)jpi, jn pi(cid:1) ak ap respectively. due charge conservation chiral fusion rules, have: compatibility operator content implies then: (cid:0)jki(cid:1) (jpi) = jk+p (i i) jk+pk, q (k) = 0; (cid:0)jn ki(cid:1) (cid:0)jn pi(cid:1) = jn (k+p) (i i) jn (k+p)k, q (k) = 0. (cid:0)jki, jn ki(cid:1) (cid:0)jpi, jn pi(cid:1) =xk (cid:0)jp+k (i i)k , jn (p+k) (i i)k(cid:1) , (8) 5 (i i)k represents elds k results chiral fusion i. compact form, non-chiral fusion rules written as: ak ap = al, l = p + k mod n. (9) non-chiral fusion rules structure zn -grading n order center zn . structure (8) isomorphic chiral fusion rules thus associativity derives directly associativity fusion rules. important make two observations related zn structure (9). first, one see set scalar elds a0 forms closed sub-algebra opa. secondly, zn -grading structure non-chiral fusion rules (9) points conservation another charge (other monodromy charge) non-chiral fusion rules. indeed, assign eld set (ap) charge (p/n) called distance charge, charge conserved. two observations important construction non-chiral fusion rules integer invariant cases problem less evident. indeed, automorphism structure discussed far operator content allows us isomorphism opa fusion rules, situation integer invariant cases. formally, diculties arise principally fact q (j) = 0, charge assigned (jpi) q (i) = 0 also zero. tackle issue cases starting modular partition functions (7) yields following structure operator content: ak =(cid:8)(cid:0)i, jki(cid:1) /q (i) = 0(cid:9) , k = 1 . . . n. (10) let us proceed naively algorithm automorphism invariant cases see happens. structure operator content, one easily see possible nice structure (9). indeed, one see (i) q (i) = 0, nd p (k) q (k) = 0 jpk = i. consequence, results products scalar elds a0 a0, possible obtain elds dierent sets (10) scalars. serious problem comes presence orbits length ni 6= n or, words, presence xed-point elds (j) (f ) = (f ). (7), means (ni = 1) one n copies scalar eld (f, f ) operator content. structure operator content (10), multiplicity translates xed point (j) also xed point (cid:0)jk(cid:1), elds (cid:0)f, jkf(cid:1) ak equal (f, f ). construction non-chiral 6 fusion rules, presence multiplicity eld creates problem since able dierentiate behavior dierent copies eld (opa). following early work {$9907137$}, existence multiple copies (n copies) pri- mary eld {p, p = 0 . . . n 1} implies, principle correspondence elds-states, corresponding lowest-weight state (ground state vector) degenerate. ob- servation suggests existence discrete symmetry zn ground states that: zn (p) = e i2p n p. (11) thus symmetry zn enables one separate contributions dierent copies degenerate eld: need impose consistency non-chiral fusion rules action symmetry. must also determine action zn elds theory. order this, rst use heuristic argument, namely elds structure (elds belonging set ap) must behavior zn . observing copy p degenerate eld belongs set ap, write that: zn () = e i2p n , ap. (12) action discrete symmetry zn provides eld ap charge equal distance charge (p/n). consistency non-chiral fusion rules zn action (11, 12) implies conservation charge fusion operation, nally obtain zn -grading (like automorphism cases) rules: (i, jpi) (cid:16)i, jp i(cid:17) =xk (cid:16)(i i)k , jp+p (i i)k(cid:17) . (13) rules, dierent copies p degenerate eld considered (f, f ) (f, jpf ). one rst note set a0 scalar elds form sub-algebra opa. scalar mean spinless elds also single elds action symmetry zn . important remark associativity (13) also consequence isomorphism structure chiral fusion rules. conservation zn charge p/n non-chiral fusion rules leads us think associating simple-current eld interpretation would provide construction less heuristic argument. integer invariant cases, simple current (j) present chiral part physical elds, namely: jp q=(cid:0)jq, jp+q(cid:1) ap. 7 (14) elds jp q indexed two integers q p. indeed, rst index q present two sectors power j second index, distance p, present also power j one sector represents non-diagonal anisotropy coupling two sectors. elds (14) form sub-algebra opa: jp1 q1 jp2 q2 = jp3 q3 ; q3 = q1 + q2 mod n, p3 = p1 + p2 mod n, action eld (i, jpi) ap determined algorithm: (15) (16) jp1 q1 (i, jpi) =(cid:0)k, jp+p1k(cid:1) a, k = jq1i. thus, one sees physical elds jp q (14) simple-current elds non-chiral fusion rules. structure, easily seen simple elds divided two categories. rst one scalar elds p = 0. form sub-algebra current-eld algebra (15) generated fusion operation (j, j). second category characterized non-vanishing distance p hence composed set non-vanishing spin elds. representative element set, one holomorphic (antiholomorphic) eld (1, j) ((j, 1)). (15), clear non-vanishing simple spin elds generated (1, j) (j, j). chiral fusion rules, presence simple elds implies conservation charge non-chiral fusion rules. indeed, action simple scalar eld (j, j) (16) given eld aects two sectors equal footing general structure eld change. hence, simple eld (j, j) seen playing role simple current (j) expresses conservation monodromy charge non-chiral fusion rules. fact comes actually imposing naturality statement construction non-chiral fusion rules. important holomorphic simple eld (1, j) since action (16) aects right sector hence allows establishment correspondence elds dierent sets ap: (1, j) ap = ap+1. (17) holomorphic simple eld (1, j) plays role generator distance p. terms orbifold partition functions , eq. (17) means elds twisted sectors {ap6=0} generated gradually non-chiral fusion twist eld (1, j) elds untwisted sector a0. this, deduce important fact behavior degenerate elds. indeed, denoting component degenerate eld {p}p=n 1 element set {ap}p=n 1 , set (17) that: p=0 p=0 (1, j) p = p+1. (18) 8 eq. (18) nothing reinterpretation action zn cyclic symmetry (11). possible get general structure non-chiral fusion rules, estab- lishing zn -grading structure. first start general form non-chiral fusion rules set scalar elds a0: a0 a0 = bi 0 ai, n 1 mi=0 (19) coecient bi 0 non-vanishing least one eld set ai appears non-chiral fusion two given scalar elds. since scalars self-conjugate, must least b0 0 6= 0. general structure non-chiral fusion rules deduced using (17) zn -gradation scalar rules (19): ap aq = n 1 mi=0 bi 0 ai+k, k = p + q mod n. (20) important point recall eq. (18) component p degenerate eld behaves like eld ap (20). order complete determination non- chiral fusion rules, remains establish scalar rules (19). important regard recall nature set scalar elds a0: represents untwisted sector terms orbifolding partition functions. sector, integer charge, forms sub-algebra original diagonal theory orbifold procedure performed, see . therefore, natural set scalar rules (19) must following associative structure: a0 a0 = a0, so, nally, non-chiral fusion rules (20) desired zn -grading structure (13). conclusion, developed work method construct non- chiral fusion rules formal structure describing operator content opa cft. particularly interested non-diagonal rational conformal models obtained simple-current construction modular invariant partition functions cyclic center zn . starting point construction naturality statement imposed consistency non-chiral fusion rules usual fusion rules two chiral sectors. results fusion operations combined properly considering closure opa consistency operator content taken induced simple currents. third step, 9 used simple current structure models establish conservation charge termed distance charge. charge related anisotropy (the distance) coupling two sectors via simple current j. symmetry trivially satised automorphism-invariant cases expected , situation less trivial integer-invariant cases careful analysis required. last cases, analysis shows prominent role played holomorphic elds (1, jp) simple current elds distance charge symmetry. important fact reminds us martinec conjuncture  states original chiral algebra symmetry sucient order rational theory, symmetry full set holomorphic elds needed order accomplish description it. result, checked eld (i, jpi) (q (i) = 0) integer-invariant part operator content distance charge equal to: p n + ni n (1 ni n ) mod 1, = 0 . . . n ni 1, p = 0 . . . ni 1.
