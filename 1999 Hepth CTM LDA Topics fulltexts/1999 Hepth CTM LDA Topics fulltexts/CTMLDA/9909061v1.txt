abstract

aspects of superstring cosmology are reviewed with an emphasis on the cosmolog-
ical implications of duality symmetries in the theory. the string eective actions are
summarized and toroidal compactication to four dimensions reviewed. global sym-
metries that arise in the compactication are discussed and the duality relationships
between the string eective actions are then highlighted. higherdimensional kasner
cosmologies are presented and interpreted in both string and einstein frames, and then
given in dimensionally reduced forms. string cosmologies containing both nontrivial
neveuschwarz/neveuschwarz and ramondramond elds are derived by employing
the global symmetries of the eective actions. anisotropic and inhomogeneous cos-
mologies in fourdimensions are also developed. the review concludes with a detailed
analysis of the prebig bang inationary scenario. the generation of primordial spectra
of cosmological perturbations in such a scenario is discussed. possible future directions
oered in the horavawitten theory are outlined.

introduction

superstring theory represents the most promising candidate for a unied theory of the
fundamental interactions, including gravity [183, 317]. one of the strongest constraints on
the theory is that it should be consistent with the standard model of the very early universe.
the cosmological implications of string theory are currently receiving considerable attention.
this interest has been inspired in part by the recent advances that have been made towards
a nonperturbative formulation of the theory. there are ve anomalyfree, supersymmetric
perturbative string theories known as the type i, type iia, type iib, so(32) heterotic and
e8  e8 heterotic theories. there is now evidence that these theories are related by a set of
dualities and may in fact represent dierent manifestations of a more fundamental quantum
theory, often termed mtheory [400]. supersymmetry implies that the quantization of the
string is only consistent if spacetime is tendimensional. on the other hand, m theory,
dened originally in terms of the strongly coupled limit of the type iia superstring, is an
elevendimensional theory. elevendimensional supergravity ts into the picture as the
lowenergy limit of this new theory [400, 381]. the goal of superstring cosmology is to
examine the dynamical evolution in these theories and re-examine cosmological questions
in the light of our new understanding of string theory.

string theory contains a number of massless degrees of freedom that are separated from

the massive states by an energy gap of orderphc/, where  is the inverse string tension

and is usually taken to be close to the planck scale (see below).
in the sigmamodel
approach one considers only the massless modes of the string, and conformal invariance
is imposed by insisting that the functions for the elds vanish. these constraints may
then be interpreted as eld equations that are derived by varying an eective spacetime
action [140, 141, 73, 356, 253]. to lowestorder in the perturbation theory and in the
lowenergy limit, the massless sectors of the superstring theories are determined by the
corresponding supergravity actions.

the standard approach in string cosmology is to analyse timedependent solutions to
the lowestorder string equations of motion. this approach applies on scales below the
string scale but above those energies where the string symmetries are broken. it is valid
if the elds evolve suciently slowly that their higherderivative terms can be neglected.
solutions derived in this context may be viewed as perturbative approximations to exact
solutions of the full theory and it is anticipated that they should exhibit at least some of
the features of these more general solutions.

a denitive prediction of string theory is the existence of a scalar eld, . this is
referred to as the dilaton and it couples directly to matter. there are two further massless
excitations that are common to all ve perturbative string theories. these are the tensor
eld, g , known as the graviton, and a rank two anti-symmetric tensor eld, b . the
appearance of the dilaton in the string spectrum was rst discussed by scherk and schwarz
[339, 340]. its vacuum expectation value determines the strengths of both the gauge and
gravitational couplings. the inverse string tension  denes the characteristic string length
scale:

(1.1)

hc ,

ls

but the eective planck length is dependent upon both  and the value of the dilaton:

pl  e/(d2) hc ,
l(d)

(1.2)

in a ddimensional spacetime (see [390] for a review). henceforth we set h = c = 1 but
retain units of length (or equivalently mass1). the gauge coupling strength is given by [390]

gauge  g2

s  e =(cid:18) lpl

ls (cid:19)d2

,

(1.3)

and thus we enter the weak coupling regime of string theory for e  1. in such a regime, one
may treat the dilaton as a massless particle in perturbative string theory. the cosmological
consequences of the dilaton eld in this regime are profound and its dynamical eects lead to
a radical departure from the standard picture of early universe cosmology based on einstein
gravity with a xed planck length.

a central paradigm of modern theoretical models of the early universe is cosmological
ination, where the universe undergoes an epoch of accelerated expansion in its most distant
past. (an extended bibliography can be found in the recent reviews [248, 250, 269, 219]).
if sucient ination occurs, many of the problems of the hot big bang model, such as the
horizon and atness problems, can in principle be resolved [188]. ination also provides a
causal mechanism for generating a primordial spectrum of density inhomogeneities [248].
this is essential for producing the observed largescale structure in the universe as well
as the temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background radiation. a crucial
question that must be addressed in string cosmology, therefore, is whether the theory admits
realistic inationary solutions. it is known that supergravity corrections make it dicult
to obtain suciently at potentials to drive conventional slow-roll ination [269]. in recent
years an inationary model known as the prebig bang scenario has been developed [154]
employing the concepts of string duality within a cosmological setting. in this model, the
accelerated expansion of the universe is driven by the kinetic energy of the dilaton eld.
this diers signicantly from the standard chaotic ination picture, where the expansion is
driven by potential energy. although there presently remain unresolved problems with this
scenario, it does have a number of important astrophysical consequences that in principle
could be detectable within the next few years. this opens up the tantalizing prospect of
directly constraining string theory via current and forthcoming cosmological observations.
in this review, we discuss the nature of cosmological solutions that are derived from
the string eective actions, with particular emphasis on the cosmological implications of
duality symmetries. prior to the developments that led to the discovery of string dualities,
the majority of studies in string cosmology focused on the e8  e8 heterotic theory, since
this is considered to be the theory most relevant to particle physics phenomenology. (for
a review see, e.g., ref. [383] and references therein). given such a change in perspective,
however, the type ii theories and elevendimensional supergravity may also be relevant
to cosmology. one of the purposes of this review is to focus on some of the cosmological
aspects of the type ii theories.

this review is intended for a wide audience including particle physicists, cosmologists
and relativists. it is anticipated, therefore, that the typical reader will be more expert in
some areas of the review than in others. with this in mind, we have divided the review

4

into three parts of roughly equal length. the rst part (sections 25) reviews the subject
of string dualities at the level of the supergravity theories. the second part (sections 68)
develops and studies dierent classes of string cosmologies in a variety of settings and the
nal part (sections 910) reviews the prebig bang inationary scenario.

more specically, we begin in section 2 with a summary of the dierent elds that arise
in ten and elevendimensional supergravity theories. the toroidal compactications of
the dierent sectors of the theories are then considered in section 3. section 4 proceeds to
discuss the noncompact, global symmetries of the dimensionally reduced actions that are
relevant to later sections in the review and section 5 provides an introductory overview of
the web of dualities that link the perturbative superstring theories.

in section 6 we review the higherdimensional kasner solutions based on a toroidal
spacetime that are the fundamental building blocks of many studies in string cosmology.
we present the dierent interpretations that are possible according to whether one works
in the higherdimensional, or dimensionally reduced theory, and according to whether the
solutions are presented in terms of the string length or the planck scale [whose deni-
tion given in eq. (1.2) is dependent up on the number of dimensions]. section 7 contains
a detailed analysis of four-dimensional string cosmologies containing nontrivial nsns
elds. we consider the class of spatially isotropic and homogeneous friedmannrobertson
walker (frw) universes, together with the spatially anisotropic bianchi models and the
inhomogeneous einsteinrosen spacetimes. section 8 extends the analysis to include the
ramondramond sector of the type iib theory.

a review of the prebig bang inationary scenario is presented in sections 9 and 10.
section 9 addresses the main unresolved issues in this scenario, including the question
of netuning in the initial conditions and the problem of exiting from the inationary
phase. section 10 discusses the generation of primordial perturbation spectra from quantum
vacuum uctuations in the massless elds of the string eective actions. it is shown how
the spectra are intimately related to the duality symmetries that arise in string theory. the
formalism developed therefore provides a link between these duality symmetries and the
observed largescale universe.

we conclude in section 11 with a discussion on the cosmological solutions that arise
in the horavawitten interpretation of the e8  e8 heterotic superstring [197, 198]. ap-
pendices summarise some of the mathematical concepts used in the review, including con-
formal transformations, the modular group of the torus and the bianchi classication of
homogeneous spacetimes. unless otherwise stated, units are chosen such that h = c = 1.
our signconventions are those of wald [395], denoted (+ + +) in misner, thorne and
wheeler [294].

2 mtheory and superstring eective actions

in this section we present a brief overview of the bosonic sectors of the eective supergravity
actions of the ve superstring theories together with that of d = 11 supergravity. more
detailed introductory reviews to perturbative string theories are provided in [183, 317, 268,
315], where a full bibliography can also be found. recent extended reviews on supergravity
theories in higher dimensions can be found in [398, 376].

the worldsheet action for a free, closed superstring with string tension t = 1/(2),

(2.1)

is

s =

1

4z d2hx x  + i i

the coordinates on the worldsheet are  = (, ) ( = 0, 1) and the gauge has been chosen
such that the worldsheet has a at metric. the coordinates x (, ) ( = 0, 1, . . . , d  1)
are the coordinates of the string worldsheet propagating in ddimensional minkowski
spacetime with (at) metric  . the spinors on the worldsheet are denoted by  =
(, ). the matrices  are 2  2 matrices satisfying the algebra {, }+ = 2 and
can be taken to be real.
the worldsheet action (2.1) is supersymmetric in the sense that it is invariant under

the innitesimal transformation:

x  = i,

 = x 

(2.2)

where  represents a constant anti-commuting spinor. this worldsheet supersymmetry
relates the spacetime coordinates x (, ) to the fermionic variables (, ).

a suitable choice of basis for the matrices is:

dening the matrix 2  01 then implies that the spinor  may be separated into two
chiral components:

0 =  0

1 =  0 1
1 0 !

the equation of motion for the fermionic degrees of freedom is the twodimensional

dirac equation:

the importance of the basis (2.4) is that it allows eq. (2.6) to become separated into two
parts:

this implies that left and right moving fermions have negative and positive chirality, re-
spectively. moreover, since they are decoupled, they can be treated separately.

both the left and right moving fermions are either periodic or anti periodic, i.e., 
2) = 

boundary conditions must be imposed on solutions to these equations. for closed strings
l,r( =
l,r( = 0). the sector corresponding to periodic boundary conditions is referred
to as the ramond (r) sector [324], whereas the sector for anti periodic boundary conditions
is known as the neveuschwarz (ns) sector [306, 307]. it follows that for both left and right
moving fermions there are four possible sectors in total: nsns, rr, nsr and rns. the
spacetime bosonic excitations arise from the nsns and rr sectors, whereas the fermions
arise from the nsr and rns sectors.

in the zeroslope limit,   0, all massive modes in the superstring spectrum decouple,
and only the massless sector remains. the eective action for the massless excitations of the
superstring can be derived by rewriting the worldsheet action (2.1) for a curved spacetime
background and imposing the constraint that quantum corrections do not break conformal
invariance. this implies the vanishing of the functions and these constraints can in turn
be interpreted as eld equations derived from an eective action [73, 140, 141, 356, 253].

type iia superstring. the eective bosonic action of the type iia superstring is n = 2,
d = 10, nonchiral supergravity and is given by

where r10 is the ricci scalar curvature of the spacetime with metric gm n and g10  detgm n .
strings sweep out geodesic surfaces with respect to the metric gm n . the corresponding
[205, 159, 74].
action in the conformally related einstein frame was presented in refs.
the dilaton eld, , determines the value of the string coupling parameter, g2
s = e. it
is interesting to note that the dilatongraviton sector of this action may be interpreted as
a tendimensional bransdicke theory [50], where the coupling between the dilaton and
graviton is specied by the bransdicke parameter  = 1. the antisymmetric tensor eld
strengths are dened by h3 = db2, f2 = da1, f4 = da3 and f 4 = f4 + a1  h3, where
in general xp denotes an antisymmetric pform potential and d is the exterior derivative.
the last term in eq.
(2.9) is a chernsimons term and is a necessary consequence of
supersymmetry. for the backgrounds we consider in this review, however, this term can
be neglected and we do not consider it further. action (2.9) represents the zerothorder
expansion in both the string coupling and the inverse string tension. the nsns sector of
the action contains the graviton, the antisymmetric 2form potential and the dilaton eld.
the rr sector contains antisymmetric pform potentials, where p is odd. the nsns
sector couples directly to the dilaton, but the rr elds do not [400, 316].

there are two gravitini in the spectra of both the type iia and type iib theories. they
therefore have n = 2 supersymmetry [178]. what distinguishes the two theories is that
the gravitini have opposite chirality in the type iia theory, and this theory is therefore
nonchiral. conversely, the gravitini have the same chirality in the type iib theory and
this theory is chiral.

type iib superstring. the bosonic massless excitations arising in the nsns sector
of the type iib superstring are the dilaton, , the metric, gm n , and the antisymmetric,
2form potential, denoted here by b(1)
m n . the rr sector contains a scalar axion eld, , a
2form potential, b(2)
m n , and a 4form potential, dm n p q. the eld equations correspond
to those of n = 2, d = 10 chiral supergravity [342, 179, 351, 201]. the eld equation for
the 4form implies that its 5form eld strength should be selfdual. this latter constraint
can not be derived from a covariant tendimensional action [285]. however, one may drop
this selfduality constraint by introducing new degrees of freedom at the level of the action.
the constraint can then be imposed as a consistent truncation of the eld equations derived
from this more general action [43]. the appropriate bosonic action is given by [42, 43]

once again the rr elds do not couple directly to the dilaton eld, but in contrast to the

type i superstring. the theory that admits open string states is the type i theory. the
boundary conditions for an open string halve the number of supersymmetries to n = 1
[183]. open strings can carry charges at their ends. however, the theory is only free from
anomalies and quantum mechanically consistent if the gauge group is uniquely chosen to
be so(32) [180]. the bosonic sector of the eective action for the massless excitations of
the type i superstring is n = 1, d = 10 supergravity coupled to so(32) super yangmills
theory [178, 180, 181, 182]. the action for this supergravity theory was originally derived
in refs. [82, 39, 40, 84]. in the string frame it takes the form [400]:

where f 2
2 is the yangmills eld strength taking values in the gauge group g = so(32) and
h3 = db2 is the eld strength of a 2form potential, b2. we note that this eld strength
is not coupled to the dilaton eld in this frame.

heterotic superstring. the origin of the two heterotic theories derives from the fact that
the left and rightmoving modes of a closed string can be considered independently [183].
thus, supersymmetry need only be imposed in the rightmoving sector. this reduces the
supersymmetry to n = 1. quantization of the leftmoving sector then requires the gauge
groups to be either so(32) or e8  e8, depending on the fermionic boundary conditions
that are imposed [185]. the eective action of the heterotic superstring is

where f 2
2 is the eld strength corresponding to the gauge groups so(32) or e8  e8 [185,
186, 187]. the heterotic and type i theories have the same particle content. their eective
actions dier, however, because all bosonic degrees of freedom couple directly to the dilaton
eld in the heterotic theory, whereas the 2form potential is a rr degree of freedom in the
type i theory.

elevendimensional supergravity. we conclude this section with a discussion on a
further supergravity theory that is closely related to the tendimensional theories discussed
above. this is n = 1, d = 11 supergravity [106, 103, 107].
it is now widely believed
that this theory represents the lowenergy limit of mtheory [400, 381]. the simplest
way to appreciate why the d = 11 theory is special is to consider the eld content of
d = 4 supergravity theories by counting the number of onshell massless degrees of freedom.
(for a review, see, e.g., ref.
[143]). to construct the representations for an extended
supergravity theory of type n , one begins with the state of maximum helicity max. each
of the n supersymmetry generators (charges) then acts successively to lower the helicity
of the physical states by onehalf unit, so that the lowest helicity in the super-multiplet is
min = maxn/2 [374]. this implies that there must exist particles of helicity ||  n/4 in
such an extended theory. requiring that a theory in four dimensions contains no elds with
helicity ||  5/2 limits the maximum number of allowed supersymmetries to be n = 8. in
this case, the state of maximum helicity, max = 2, represents the graviton (vierbein).
the particle content of the n = 8, d = 4 supergravity can be identied with the
massless degrees of freedom arising in certain higherdimensional theories. the number
of degrees of freedom of the bosonic and fermionic elds that arise in such theories in d
dimensions is summarized in tables (1) and (2) [302, 116].
in four dimensions each of
the spinors associated with the supersymmetry generators has four degrees of freedom.
thus, we have eight, fourcomponent spinors, yielding a total of 32 degrees of freedom. in
general, a supergravity theory is said to be maximal if it has 32 conserved supercharges in
any dimension. table (1) implies that the number of spinor degrees of freedom increases
with the dimensionality of the spacetime and the highest dimension consistent with 32
degrees of freedom is d = 11. since a necessary condition for two theories to be related
is that they should have the same number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom, an
identication between n = 8, d = 4 supergravity and a higherdimensional theory is only
possible if d  11, at least for a spacetime with signature (1, d  1) [302]. remarkably,
supersymmetry leads us to an upper limit on the dimensionality of spacetime.
the unique theory in eleven dimensions is n = 1 supergravity and the number of
graviton degrees of freedom in this case is (11  8)/2 = 44. the corresponding gravitino
can be represented as a majorana spinor in eleven dimensions and has (25  8)/2 = 128
degrees of freedom. supersymmetry therefore requires the introduction of a further 84
bosonic degrees of freedom. table (2) immediately suggests a plausible candidate in the
form of a threeindex, antisymmetric tensor gauge eld. indeed, it can be shown that such
a eld is the only eld that could be introduced if supersymmetry is to be maintained [302].
introducing 84 spin0 elds, for example, would violate supersymmetry.

where f4 = da3 is the fourform eld strength of the threeindex gauge potential a3. the
elevendimensional newton constant, g11, is related to the planck length by g11 = l(9)
pl
and is the only parameter in the theory [81]. the chernsimons term arises as a direct
consequence of the supersymmetry [106].

it can be shown that the bosonic degrees of freedom in this theory can be consistently
identied with those of n = 8, d = 4 supergravity by compactifying the former theory
on a 7torus, t 7. indeed, cremmer and julia rst derived the lagrangian for the n = 8,
d = 4 theory by performing such a compactication [103, 107]. moreover, compactication
of n = 1, d = 11 supergravity on a circle, s1, results in the type iia supergravity theory
[74, 205, 159]. this correspondence proves central when interpreting the strongly coupled
limit of the type iia superstring in terms of an elevendimensional theory [400, 381].

in conclusion, there exist ve supersymmetric string theories that each have a consistent
weak coupling expansion in perturbative theory. the type i theory and the two heterotic
theories have (tendimensional) n = 1 supersymmetry. the type ii theories have n = 2
supersymmetry. heterotic and type ii superstrings are oriented, unbreakable and closed.
open strings are only possible in the type i theory where strings are unoriented and break-
able. there is no freedom for introducing a super yangmills gauge group in the type ii
theories and the only gauge group that can be consistently introduced in the type i theory
is so(32). the heterotic theories admit both so(32) and e8  e8. supersymmetry im-
plies that quantum consistency is only possible in perturbative string theory if spacetime
is tendimensional. on the other hand, the upper limit on the dimensionality of spacetime
implied by supersymmetry is d = 11. indeed, requiring gravity to be unique in four dimen-
sions restricts the number of supersymmetries present in the theory. if particles are to have
helicity ||  2, the number of supersymmetries can not exceed n = 8 and this implies
d  11.
the main features of the superstring eective actions discussed in this section that are
of primary importance to cosmology are that they are higherdimensional, scalartensor
theories of gravity that contain antisymmetric tensor elds of varying degree. in order to
discuss fourdimensional cosmological solutions in these theories, therefore, we must rst
consider their compactication down to four dimensions. this is the topic of the next
section.

3 toroidal compactication of the string eective actions

3.1 toroidal compactication of the nsns action

we begin this section by considering the toroidal compactication of the nsns sector
of the string eective action which contains the dilaton eld, the graviton and a 2form
potential and is common to both the type ii and heterotic theories. (for reviews on kaluza
klein gravity see, e.g., [91, 12, 116, 16, 312]).

11

in kaluzaklein dimensional reduction, the universe is viewed as the product space m =
j k, where the d-dimensional space-time j (x) has metric g (x) (,  = 0, 1, . . . , d 
1) and the d-dimensional internal space is denoted by k(ya) with metric hab(x) (a, b =
d, . . . , d + d  1). this space must be ricci at if the matter elds are independent of its
coordinates ya. for the purposes of the present discussion, it is sucient to assume that
k is a ddimensional torus, t d. a dtorus is the subspace of the ddimensional complex
euclidean space described by zj = exp(2ij), where 0  j < 1 [7]. topologically, it is the
cartesian product of d circles, t d = s1  s1 . . . s1, and is metrically at. this manifold
has the maximal number of covariantly constant spinors. (this is related to the fact that at
tori are the only manifolds with trivial holonomy). each of these spinors is associated with
a supersymmetry that is unbroken by the compactication. for compactication to four
or more dimensions, other basic choices for the internal manifolds are those with su(n)
holonomy, corresponding to calabiyau nforms, and those with sp(n) holonomy.
(for
introductory reviews, see, e.g., [387, 310]). we do not consider such compactications in
this work, but note that in many settings, our results apply to these more general cases
when the only modulus eld that is dynamically important represents the volume of the
internal space.

when the higher-dimensional metric is compactied on a circle, it splits into a lower
dimensional metric tensor, a 1form potential (gauge eld) and a 0form potential (scalar
eld). a pform, on the other hand, splits into a pform and a (p 1)form [341, 108, 102].
for compactication on t d, therefore, the higher-dimensional graviton produces 1 graviton,
d vector elds and d(d+1)/2 spin0 elds. the nsns 2form potential splits into a 2form
potential, d 1form potentials, and d(d  1)/2 0form potentials. more generally, a pform
compactied on t d produces a total of d!/[p!(d  p)!] scalar moduli elds from its internal
components.
maharana and schwarz [281] have derived the form of the (d + d)dimensional nsns

action compactied on t d. in (d + d) dimensions, the action is given by

it is important to note that the coupling parameter between the ddimensional dilaton and

proves convenient to parametrize the internal metric hab in the form

the rst two terms in this expression correspond to the action for the gravitational sector
of the bransdicke theory of scalar-tensor gravity[50], where the coupling  between the
bransdicke eld, e, and the graviton is determined by the number of internal dimensions.

13

the coupling is bounded such that 1 <   0. it it is interesting to note that the lower
bound corresponds to the value that arises in the string eective action and is formally
saturated in the limit d  . from this viewpoint it is easy to see why the string value,  =
1, is a xed-point under further dimensional reduction by a nite number of dimensions.
we now proceed to consider how the eld strengths of the form elds behave under
toroidal compactication. we begin by compactifying the (n  1)form bm1...mn1 with
eld strength
(3.12)
on a circle of radius gyy = e2. the square brackets imply total antisymmetrization over all
indices. for simplicity, we assume that the gauge eld that also arises in the compactication
is trivial, i.e., gy = 0. in general, such a eld would lead to abelian chernsimons terms
in the dimensionally reduced action, but a detailed discussion of these terms is beyond the
scope of this review. (see, e.g., refs. [281, 258] for further details).

hm1...mn = n [m1

bm2...mn] ,

the (n 1)form potential separates into two components, a (n 1)form b(n1)
1...n2 = b1...n2y. these have eld strengths

b12...n1 and a (n  2)form b(n2)

12...n = n[1b(n1)

2...n] = h1...n

respectively. this implies that a higherdimensional action of the form

sh = z dd+1xq|gd+1|(cid:20) 1
sh = z ddxq|gd|e(cid:20) 1
(3.16)
it follows that the compactication of the nsns 3form eld strength in action (3.1) on
t d produces eld strengths for n-form potentials, where n = {0, 1, 2}. a specic calculation
yields the dimensionally reduced action [281]:
habch abc(cid:21)
sh = z ddxq|gd|e(cid:20) 1

1...n1h (n1)1...n1(cid:21)

(3.17)
where, since we are assuming that ga = 0, it follows that h = 3[b], b = b ,
hab = bab and bab = bab. we remark that since all elds are assumed to be independent
of the internal coordinates, ya, then habc  0. we will further assume for simplicity that
bab has block diagonal form, i.e., ba = 0, and hence the 2form eld strengths of the
1form potentials vanish, i.e., ha = 0.

(3.21)

in four dimensions an alternative formulation of the dimensionally reduced action can
be made by expressing the threeform eld strength, h, in terms of its poincare dual
[369, 344, 359]. this formulation is important when discussing the dierent classes of string
cosmologies that arise from the eective action. it is also relevant when investigating the
global symmetry properties of the actions. in view of this, we discuss poincare duality of
form elds further in the following section.

3.2 antisymmetric tensor fields and poincare duality

we have already seen that the eective actions in string theory contain one or more anti-
symmetric tensor eld strengths. in this section we consider a single n-form eld strength,
h, derived from an (n  1)-form potential:

ha1a2...  n[a1ba2...] ,
these elds typically appear in the action through a term

(3.22)

lh = 

ea
2n!

h 2 = 

ea
2n!

ga1b1ga2b2 . . . ha1a2...hb1b2... .

(3.23)

where  denotes a linear combination of scalar elds and a is a constant, whose numerical
value is determined by the degree of the form eld and the specic type of compactication
that is assumed. the eld equation derived from the action (3.22) is then

in addition there is a bianchi identity (closure condition)

a1(cid:16)eah a1a2...(cid:17) = 0 .

[a1ha2a3...]  0 ,

which follows from the denition of h in terms of an antisymmetric potential.

(3.24)

(3.25)

15

in order to describe the degrees of freedom associated with the form eld, h, it is
sometimes more convenient to work with a dynamically equivalent eld strength, h. this
correspondence is possible because an n-form eld in d dimensions is dual to a (dn)-form
eld (see, e.g., ref. [294]). this duality is established by means of the covariantly-conserved,
totally-antisymmetric volume form a1a2...ad . this has several important properties (we
follow the conventions of wald [395]):

1. abc... = 0.
2. 123...d =p|gd|.
3. a1a2...ajaj+1...ad a1a2...ajbj+1...bd = (1)s j! (d  j)! 

[aj+1...

bj+1... ad]

bd

where s is determined by the signature of the metric, and is equal to 0 for euclidean space,
and 1 for lorentzian spacetime.

we dene the (d  n)-form dual to h as

hb1b2...bdn 

1
n!

a1a2...anb1...bdnh a1...an .

conversely, taking the dual of h, we recover

ha1a2...an =

(1)s
(d  n)!

a1a2...anb1...bdn h b1...bdn .

substituting equation (3.27) into the eld equation (3.24), we obtain

a1a2...anb1...b(dn)a1(cid:16)ea hb1...b(dn)(cid:17) = 0 ,

which is automatically satised if

hb1b2...b(dn) = ea hb1...b(dn) ,

(3.26)

(3.27)

(3.28)

(3.29)

where h is itself an antisymmetric (d  n)-form eld strength derived from a potential

hb1b2...b(dn)  (d  n)[b1

bb2...b(dn)] .

(3.30)

the eld equation (3.28) is then satised due to the bianchi identity for the eld strength
h:

[a

hbc...] = 0 .

(3.31)

however, we see that the original bianchi identity for h, as given in equation (3.25), is

only satised if we also require that

[a1...anb1...b(dn)c]ea h b1...b(dn) = 0

and this implies that h must obey the new eld equation

b1(cid:16)ea h b1...b(dn)(cid:17) = 0 .

16

(3.32)

(3.33)

thus, the role of the eld equation and the bianchi identity is interchanged if we work in
terms of the (d  n)-form eld strength h rather than the n-form eld strength h. the
new eld equation (3.33) for h can be derived from the lagrangian

it should be emphasized that in view of the relationship

l h = 

ea

2(d  n)!

h 2 .

l h = (1)slh ,

(3.34)

(3.35)

this lagrangian is not in general equal to the original lagrangian in a lorentzian spacetime.

the energy-momentum tensor, dened as

(h)t ab =

(h)t ab =

(3.38)

throughout this review we will make extensive use of the poincare dual of eld strengths
appearing in the string eective actions. in section 6 we shall compare elementary higher-
dimensional cosmological solutions with solitonic solutions obtained in terms of their
poincare dual. the poincare dual is particularly useful in studying four dimensional cos-
mologies where the ns-ns 3-form eld strength is dual to a 1-form related to the derivative
of a pseudo-scalar axion eld. in the prebig bang scenario discussed in section 10, such
axion elds have distinctive perturbation spectra that could have important observational
consequences.

we will now employ the poincare duality discussed above to derive dual eective actions
in four dimensions rstly for the ns-ns sector, and then go on to include the rr elds of
the type ii theories.

3.3 dual eective nsns action in four dimensions

in four dimensions there exists a duality between the nsns threeform eld strength and
a oneform. this oneform may be interpreted as the gradient of a scalar degree of freedom.
applying this duality to the toroidally compactied nsns action (3.18) implies that we
may dene a pseudoscalar axion eld,  [369, 359]:

h  =  e 

(3.39)

17

(3.40)

it is important to emphasize that the action s in eq. (3.40) is not identical to the orig-
inal action s in eq. (3.18) because the roles of the bianchi identities and the eld equations
are interchanged by the poincare duality as discussed in the preceding subsection. never-
theless, the two descriptions are dynamically equivalent as long as the eld equations are
satised. in any case, either form of the action should only be viewed as an eective action
which reproduces the correct equations of motion. as we shall see in later sections, the
dual description of the action often provides the most convenient framework for discussing
the global symmetries of the eld equations. in the corresponding einstein frame, where
the dilaton eld is minimally coupled to gravity, the action is given by eq. (3.21) and the
appropriate duality transformation in this case is

h  =  e2 

(3.41)

note from eq. (3.20) that in four dimensions  = . the eld equations in the einstein
frame may then be derived by extremizing the dual action

(3.42)

this action could also be derived directly from eq. (3.18) by rst applying the poincare
duality (3.39) and then the conformal transformation (3.19). (see also eq. a.33 in appendix
a).

the d2 moduli elds arising from the internal degrees of freedom hab and bab behave
collectively as a set of massless scalar elds. from the point of view of homogeneous, four
dimensional cosmologies, where all elds are uniform on the surfaces of homogeneity, the
dynamics of the external spacetime can then be determined by considering the eects of
a single modulus eld, . this is formally equivalent to considering the compactication
of the (4 + d)dimensional eective nsns action (3.1) on an isotropic dtorus, where the
components of the twoform potential on the internal space are assumed to be trivial. the
radius, or breathing mode of the internal space, is then parametrized by the modulus eld,
, and determines the volume of the internal dimensions. in many settings, therefore, it is
sucient to assume that the (4 + d)dimensional metric is of the form

ds2 = dt2 + gijdxidxj + e2/dabdx adx b

(3.43)

where indices run from (i, j) = (1, 2, 3) and (a, b) = (4, . . . , 3+d) and ab is the ddimensional
kronecker delta. the modulus eld  is normalized in such a way that it becomes minimally
coupled to gravity in the einstein frame.

18

the eective dilaton in the fourdimensional spacetime is then given by eq. (3.7) as

the dimensionally reduced actions (3.45) and (3.46) may be viewed as the prototype
actions for string cosmology because they contain many of the key features common to more
general actions. cosmological solutions to these actions have been extensively discussed in
the literature, both in the homogeneous and inhomogeneous contexts (see section 7). many
of these solutions play a central role in the prebig bang inationary scenario reviewed in
sections 9 and 10. however, it is also important to determine whether nontrivial rr elds
can have signicant eects on the dynamics of the universe. in view of this, we derive in
the next two subsections truncated versions of type iia and type iib eective actions. as
in the above analysis we compactify the theories on an isotropic sixtorus when only the
variations of the form elds on the fourdimensional spacetime are included. this allows
a direct comparison to be made with the nsns actions (3.45) and (3.46). a detailed
comparison of the type iib cosmologies is presented in section 8.

3.4 dual eective action for the type iia theory in four dimensions

the type iia string eective action, in the absence of vector elds and the chernsimons
term, is given by eq. (2.9):

s =z d10xq|g10|(cid:20)e(cid:18)r10 + ()2

(3.47)

we compactify on an isotropic sixtorus corresponding to eq. (3.43) and assume that the
only nontrivial components of the formelds are those on the external fourdimensional
spacetime. we also normalize the action such that 164 = 1.

the dimensionally reduced action is given by

in the einstein frame the dual of the nsns threeform eld strength is given by eq.

(3.41). the eld equation for the fourform is deduced directly from eq. (3.24):

and the bianchi identity for this eld strength is

32 f (cid:17) = 0

f  = qe3+2

(3.51)

(3.52)

(3.53)

where q is an arbitrary constant.

it follows, therefore, that the truncated type iia eld equations in the einstein frame

can be derived from the dual action

it is seen that including the excitations of the rr 3form potential on the external spacetime
introduces an eective, exponential interaction potential for the fourdimensional dilaton
and modulus elds.

3.5 dual eective action for the type iib theory in four dimensions

the lowenergy limit of the type iib superstring is n = 2, d = 10 chiral supergravity
[343, 201]. in what follows, we assume that the rr 4form vanishes. the eld equations
for the remaining degrees of freedom can then be derived by extremizing the action [42]:

12(cid:16)h (1)(cid:17)2(cid:21)

(3.55)

the toroidal compactication of the type iib theory (3.55) has been discussed at dier-
ent levels of complexity [42, 278, 335, 43, 8]. maharana [278] and roy [335] compactied
down to d dimensions and showed how the sl(2, r) symmetry of the tendimensional the-
ory is respected in lower dimensions (see section 8.1) [204, 345, 43].
in this section we
compactify the tendimensional action (3.55) to four dimensions with the toroidal ansatz

20

(3.43) [98, 99]. the reduced fourdimensional eective actions in the string and einstein
frames are then given by

respectively, where the dilaton eld, , is dened in eq. (3.49).

for the remainder of this section our discussion takes place within the context of the
einstein frame and we therefore drop tildes for notational simplicity. we now proceed to
derive an action that is dual to eq. (3.57) by exploiting the poincare duality that exists
between the form elds. the discussion is somewhat more complicated than that presented
in section 3.2, however, due to the nonlinear couplings that exist between the elds in the
action (3.57).

the eld equations for the threeforms are given by

he
he2h (1)  + e

3(cid:16)h (1)  + h (2) (cid:17)i = 0
3(cid:16)h (1)  + h (2) (cid:17)i = 0

and, since the threeform eld strengths are dual to oneforms in four dimensions, we may
write

h (1)
  k 
h (2)
  j 

the eld equations (3.58) and (3.59) then take the form

he
he2k + e

3 (k + j)i = 0
3 (k + j)i = 0

when written in terms of the dual oneforms.

(3.60)

(3.61)

(3.62)

(3.63)

these dual forms may be written in terms of the gradients of two pseudoscalar axion

elds. equation (3.62) requires that

where 2 is any scalar function. substituting this into eq. (3.63) implies that

e

3 (k + j) = 2,

e2k + 2 = 1,

21

(3.64)

(3.65)

where 1 is a second arbitrary scalar function. these together imply that the eld equations
(3.58) and (3.59) are automatically satised by [99]

h (1)  = e2 (1  2)
h (2)  = he32  e2 (1  2)i .

(3.66)

(3.67)

it should be emphasised that the denitions of both scalar elds i are arbitrary up to
a redenition i  i + fi, where fi represents an arbitrary scalar function. in this sense,
therefore, there is no unique denition of the pseudoscalar axion elds. however, when
h (2)
 =  = 0, we see that our denition of 1 coincides with the usual denition presented
in eq. (3.41) for the axion eld that is dual to the nsns threeform eld strength.

although the eld equations (3.58) and (3.59) for the threeforms are now automatically

satised by the dual ansatz, we must also impose the bianchi identities

that arise because the threeform eld strengths are dened in terms of the gradients of
twoform potentials. these correspond to the constraint equations

derived from the eective action [98, 99]

the oneforms k and j dened in eqs. (3.60) and (3.61) can be written in terms of the

k = e2(1  2)
j = e3+2  k

22

(3.75)

(3.76)

and the bianchi identities (3.69) and (3.70) simply correspond to the requirement that these
currents are conserved:

k = 0 ,

j = 0.

(3.77)

in terms of the original threeform eld strengths, these currents are topologically con-
served due to the bianchi identities, but in the dual formulation they are noether currents
conserved due to the symmetry of the action (3.71).

the conserved currents allow us to integrate out the kinetic terms for the pseudoscalar

axion elds i. this reduces the eld equations (3.723.74) to

as we simply swap our ignorance of  for our ignorance of 2. however, it is indicative
of a further symmetry of the dual action. we discuss this symmetry when we present
cosmological solutions from this action in section 8.

this concludes our discussion of the fourdimensional string eective actions that are
of particular relevance to cosmology. in the following section we proceed to investigate the
global symmetries that are exhibited by these actions.
in general, supergravity theories
containing scalar elds exhibit noncompact, global symmetries. the duality symmetries
of superstring theory are discrete subgroups of these global symmetry groups. considerable
insight into the nature of duality can therefore be gained by studying the symmetries that
arise in the compactied supergravity theories. in particular, the action (3.40) exhibits a
global sl(2, r) symmetry that acts nonlinearly on the dilaton and axion elds. further-
more, the nsns action (3.1) exhibits a global o(d, d) symmetry when compactied on a
dtorus.

23

4 global symmetries of the toroidally compactied nsns

action

4.1 nonlinear sigmamodels

a global symmetry of a supergravity theory is generally associated with a noncompact
lie group, g. the scalar elds {i} in the theory parametrize the coset g/h, where h
represents the maximal compact subgroup of g. (this condition is required in order to
avoid ghosts [107]). this space is referred to as the target space, , and is a noncompact,
riemannian symmetric space with a metric ij(k). the corresponding line element may
be written as

(4.1)
and the scalar elds {i} may therefore be viewed as coordinates on . this implies that
the number of scalar elds is given by the dimensionality of the coset space:

target = ij(k)didj

ds2

n (i) = dim g  dim h,

i = 1, 2, . . . , n

(4.2)

in many settings the target space is also referred to as the moduli space and the scalar
elds are called moduli elds. the method of describing scalar elds with coset spaces
was described in ref. [72].

the scalar elds couple to gravity in the form of a nonlinear sigmamodel. a sum-
mary of such models can be found in [398, 52].
in the simplest case, we may consider
ddimensional einstein gravity coupled to n scalar elds {i}. the action of such a sys-
tem is
(4.3)

s =z ddxq|gd|hrd  g (x)i(x) j(x)ij ((x))i

where g (x) is the spacetime metric. these elds are functions of the spacetime coordinates
x and solutions to the scalar eld equations dene a map from the spacetime manifold
with metric g to the target space manifold with metric ij.

we are interested in models where the target space metric may be parametrized in terms
of a suitable matrix representation of a group element p  g. in other words, we write the
line element of the target space as

and the action (4.3) as

ds2

target = 

1
4

tr(cid:16)dpdp1(cid:17)

tr(pp1)(cid:21)
in practice, it is often convenient to introduce the square root of p:

v  g

(4.4)

(4.5)

where a superscript t denotes the transpose. the matrix v plays a role analogous to that

written as

eq. (4.5) is invariant under the global g symmetry transformations

g  g ,

v  vu t,

p  upu t

(4.8)

where u  g is a constant matrix. the action (4.5) is also invariant under an independent
local h symmetry transformation that depends on the target space coordinates {i}. this
local h symmetry may be employed to choose a gauge where the scalar elds belonging to
the h subgroup are consistently set to zero. this is why the number of independent scalar
elds in the model is given by eq. (4.2) rather than by the dimensionality of g.

a general feature of nonlinear sigmamodels of this type is that the gravitational
sector transforms as a singlet, i.e., the spacetime metric is invariant under the symmetry
transformations (4.8). this proves important in sections 7 and 8 when we employ some of
the noncompact global symmetries of the string eective actions to generate new string
cosmologies from previously known solutions.

a global symmetry of this type was rst discovered within the context of n = 4, d = 4
supergravity by performing an appropriate poincare duality transformation [104, 105]. the
symmetry group in this theory is g = sl(2, r) and h = u(1). the sl(2, r)/u(1) coset is
an important model and proves central to our subsequent discussions. we therefore consider
this model in some detail in the next subsection.

4.2 the sl(2,r)/u(1) coset

the group sl(2, r) is the group of all real 2  2 matrices with unit determinant. a matrix
n is an element of this group if it satises the invariance condition [308]

where

n tjn = j

j =  0

1 0 ! ,

j 2 = i2

(4.9)

(4.10)

is the sl(2, r) metric and i2 is the 2  2 identity matrix. this implies that the inverse of
n is given linearly by
(4.11)

n1 = jn tj

the action for the sl(2, r)/u(1) nonlinear sigmamodel coupled to einstein gravity

in d dimensions is

and the target space metric is given by ds2
is precisely the axiondilatongraviton sector of the string eective action (3.42) when
formulated in terms of the einstein frame metric (3.19). to establish that this action is
indeed invariant under a global sl(2, r) transformation on the scalar elds {, }, it is
convenient to introduce the triangular sl(2, r) matrix

in the form

s =z ddxq|gd|(cid:20)rd +

tr(cid:16)mm1(cid:17)(cid:21)

where u is dened as the constant sl(2, r) matrix

u   d c
b a ! ,

ad  bc = 1

(4.17)

we emphasize that this sl(2, r) transformation acts nonlinearly on the scalar elds but
leaves the spacetime metric g invariant. specically, the two scalar elds transform to

e  c2e + (d + c)2e
e  ace + (b + a)(d + c)e

this sl(2, r) transformation is global, in the sense that u is independent of the scalar

v  ovu t

(4.20)
where o = o(i) is eld-dependent. substitution of eq. (4.20) into eq. (4.7) implies that
the action (4.16) is invariant under eq. (4.20) if oto = i2. thus, o must be an element
of the group so(2). this is the maximal compact subgroup of sl(2, r) and is isomorphic
to u(1). thus, we may conclude that the scalar elds  and  in action (4.12) parametrize
the sl(2, r)/u(1) coset.

there exists the isomorphism sl(2, r) = su(1, 1) and the su(1, 1)/u(1) formulation
[332, 333, 41, 334]. the global sl(2, r) symmetry

of this coset is discussed in refs.
summarized above may also be described in terms of the complex parameter:

the sl(2, r) transformation corresponding to eq. (4.8) is then equivalent to the scalar
eld  undergoing a fractional linear transformation

   + ie

(4.21)

(4.22)

the discrete subgroup sl(2, z) represents the modular group of the 2torus and, in this
context, the eld  is the modular parameter of the torus. this fundamental connection
with the 2torus is discussed further in appendix b.

26

this concludes our discussion on the sl(2, r)/u(1) coset. the dilaton and axion elds
in the string eective action (3.42) parametrize such a coset and this action is therefore
invariant under a global sl(2, r) transformation. this transformation leaves the einstein
frame metric, g , and the moduli elds, hab and bab, invariant. the dilaton and axion
transform according to eqs. (4.18) and (4.19). in the following subsection, we discuss a
further symmetry of the action (3.42).

4.3 the o(d,d)/o(d)o(d) coset
the d2 moduli elds that arise in the toroidal compactication of the nsns string eective
action parametrize the o(d, d)/o(d)  o(d) coset. the group o(d, d) is the noncompact,
pseudoorthogonal group in 2d dimensions (see, e.g., [172, 308]). its representation is given
by

u =  w x

y z !  o(d, d)

(4.23)

(4.24)

(4.27)

where {w, x, y, z} are d  d matrices such that u preserves the bilinear form :

   0
and id is the d  d identity matrix. this implies that

u tu = ,

id

id

0 !

w ty + y tw = 0, x tz + z tx = 0, w tz + y tx = id

(4.25)

since 2 = i2d, the inverse of u is given linearly:

u1 = u t

(4.26)

the maximal compact subgroup of o(d, d) is o(d)  o(d). this is generated by elements
of the form

u =

1

1  2 1 + 2 !
2  1 + 2 1  2

k = id (k = 1, 2), i.e., 1, 2  o(d). the dimension of o(d)  o(d) is d2  d and
the parametrization of the o(d, d)/o(d)  o(d) coset is determined by introducing the

m =  h1

bh1 h  bh1b !

h1b

(4.30)

substituting eq. (4.28) into eq. (4.7) and noting from eq. (4.26) that the inverse of m is
given by m1 = m then allows us to write the line element of the o(d, d)/o(d)  o(d)
coset space as

where in this expression h represents the internal metric on the dtorus. comparison with

  ,
(4.24) and m is given by eq.

(4.30). thus, the moduli elds

where u satises eq.
parametrize the o(d, d)/o(d)  o(d) coset.
the ddimensional string coupling and spacetime metric transform as singlets under
eq. (4.34), as does the 3form eld strength h. in general, such a symmetry arises when
there exist d abelian isometries in the model. (when d+d = 10 and d = (7, 8), however, the
symmetry groups are enlarged. see, e.g., refs. [286, 83, 18, 277, 224] for details). the case
o(2, 2) is relevant when considering certain classes of inhomogeneous string cosmologies, as
is discussed further in section 7.3. moreover, the o(3, 3) group is employed in section 7.2
to generate elementary bianchi type i cosmological solutions [288].

4.4 manifestly invariant field equations

we conclude this section by deriving the scalar eld equations for the sl(2, r)/u(1) and
o(d, d)/o(d) o(d) nonlinear sigmamodels. these equations can be expressed in a mani-
festly symmetric form. this is important because the evolution equations for perturbations
around an arbitrary classical solution can also be written in a symmetric way, at least for
the sl(2, r)/u(1) model. this turns out to be an extremely powerful tool when considering

28

inhomogeneous perturbations about homogeneous cosmological solutions derived from this
model (see section 10).

we obtain the classical equations of motion for the sl(2, r)/u(1) model from the action
given in eq. (4.16), by considering rst-order variations of the matrix m dened in eq.
(4.15). we should proceed with caution since this matrix is subject to several constraints.
the variation must be performed in a way that is consistent with the properties of the group
sl(2, r). we therefore consider an innitesimal sl(2, r) transformation m  umu t,
where u = 1 + , and keep terms only up to rstorder in . this yields the required
perturbation:

where eq. (4.9) implies that  must satisfy the constraint

m = m + mt ,

t = jj .

(4.35)

(4.36)

this in turn implies that  is traceless, tr = 0.

the matter sector of the sl(2, r) invariant lagrangian given in eq.

(4.16) may be

written as

l = 

1
4

tr[jmjm] ,

by employing eq. (4.11). hence its rst-order perturbation can be written as

l = 
from eq. (4.36) and the identity

tr[jmj(m + mt )]

one then obtains

mjmj = mjmj

l = tr[(mjmj)]   (tr[mjmj]) .

(4.37)

(4.38)

(4.39)

(4.40)

the total divergence in eq. (4.40) vanishes if we only allow variations, , that vanish
on the boundary. classical solutions that extremize the action (4.16) must therefore satisfy
the eld equation

thus, the sl(2, r) symmetry leads to the classically conserved current

we remark that the cyclical property of the trace and eq.
tr[k] = 0.

(4.11) together imply that

we can obtain an eective action for rstorder perturbations about any classical,
sl(2, r) background solution by considering second-order perturbations of the lagrange
density in eq. (4.37). we assume that the second-order perturbations are of the form given
in eq. (4.35) and, by employing the background equation of motion (4.41), we obtain the
second-order eective action for :

2l = tr[()2 + (mj)2  k (  )] .

(4.43)

29

by considering a variation of , we are now able to derive the euler-lagrange equation

for perturbations about a given background solution:

( + mjmj + k  k) = 0 .
thus, we have derived a conserved current for the perturbations:

k   + mjmj + k  k

(4.44)

(4.45)

this current can also be derived directly by perturbing eq. (4.42) which provides a useful
consistency check.

the perturbed current in eq. (4.45) is necessarily traceless. nevertheless, it is possible
to construct two nontrivial perturbations that remain invariant under a global sl(2, r)
transformation of the background solution. they are given by

u  2tr[k] = tr[jmjm] ,
v  2tr[mjk] = tr[jmjmjm] .

(4.46)

(4.47)

respectively, where we have employed eq. (4.35). these spacetime vectors and their deriva-
tives are the only non-trivial sl(2, r) invariant rst-order perturbations that can be con-
structed. their divergences yield sl(2, r) invariant scalars

u  u = tr[kk ] ,
v  v = tr[mjkk ]

(4.48)

(4.49)

the energy-momentum tensor derived from the sl(2, r) invariant lagrange density in

eq. (4.37) can be written as

t  = 

1

2(cid:18)gg 

1
2

g g(cid:19) tr[kk] .

(4.50)

thus, the scalar u dened in eq. (4.48) can be identied with the perturbation of the trace
of the energy-momentum tensor, and hence must lead to a perturbation of the spacetime
curvature. by contrast, v may remain non-zero even when the energy-momentum tensor
is unperturbed and thus describes an isocurvature perturbation of the elds. the time
components of the vectors (4.46) and (4.47) are directly related to the variables that describe
cosmological curvature and entropy perturbations in prebig bang cosmologies (see eqs.
(10.61) and (10.62) in section 10). these manifestly sl(2, r) invariant quantities will allow
us to fully generalize the cosmological perturbation spectra calculated in vacuum models to
include the eects of the pseudoscalar axion eld in section 10.

the derivation of the o(d, d) invariant equations of motion was presented in ref. [288]
and is very similar to the above derivation for the sl(2, r) model. this is due to the similar
properties of the two groups. the only signicant dierence in the derivation is that the
o(d, d) metric , as given in eq. (4.24), is symmetric rather than antisymmetric. this
implies that the variation, , must satisfy t = . by dening the traceless matrix

l  mm ,

30

(4.51)

we may write the euler-lagrange equations as l = 0 [288]. the eective action for
perturbations about an o(d, d) invariant background solution is derived in an exactly anal-
ogous fashion to that discussed above and we recover the perturbed equation of motion
l = 0, where

l =  + mm + l  l .

(4.52)

we can construct an o(d, d) invariant spacetime vector perturbation

w  2t r[mm] ,

(4.53)

analogous to u in eq. (4.46), whose divergence, w  w, describes the o(d, d) invariant
curvature perturbation. but the symmetry of the o(d, d) metric,  in eq. (4.24), means
that the vector analogous to v vanishes identically, and we are unable to construct an
o(d, d) invariant isocurvature perturbation.

5 s, t and udualities

in section 2 we wrote down the bosonic sectors of the eective actions for the ve pertur-
bative superstring theories, together with that of n = 1, d = 11 supergravity. whilst one
could proceed to develop cosmological models from these apparently dierent theories by
directly solving the eld equations, it is constructive to rst discuss the deep relationships
that exist between them. these relationships manifest themselves in the duality symmetries
of the theories. a number of authors have recently surveyed the dramatic progress that has
been made in this subject [6, 114, 376, 246, 230, 189, 398, 366, 347, 348, 346, 113, 387, 363,
160, 7, 309, 13, 172, 317, 367]. our primary aim here is to convey the key points of string
duality to those with an interest in its cosmological implications. with this in mind, we
follow an heuristic approach and restrict our discussion to the level of the eective super-
gravity actions. whilst such an approach has obvious limitations, it represents a rst step
towards studying string dualities and proves important in locating theories that are dual to
one another, or are selfdual.

three fundamental types of duality arise in string theory. these are referred to as s,
t and uduality, respectively. two string theories, a and b, are said to be tdual to
one another if the compactication of theory a on a space of small volume is equivalent
if the
to the compactication of theory b on a space of large volume, and viceversa.
two theories a and b are equivalent under sduality, then the strong coupling limit of one
theory is mapped onto the weak coupling limit of the other, and viceversa. finally, a and
b are related by uduality if the compactication of a on a space of large (small) volume
is equivalent to b at strong (weak) coupling. in some cases, a given theory is mapped onto
itself by a duality transformation and the duality then represents an exact symmetry of the
theory. an example is the sduality of the type iib superstring in ten dimensions [204].

the best understood of the three dualities is tduality [70, 71, 305, 379]. (for reviews
on tduality, see refs. [172, 6, 7, 189, 316]). this is a perturbative symmetry in the sense
that the transformation takes the weak coupling limit of one theory onto the weak coupling
limit of another theory. it can therefore be tested at the level of perturbation theory and
shown to be exact order by order [331, 172]. by contrast, s and udualities are non
perturbative symmetries in the string coupling. qualitatively, one may view uduality as

31

the unication of s and tduality, i.e., u = s  t . the rst suggestion that string theory
exhibits a strong/weak coupling sduality was made within the context of the heterotic
theory compactied on t 6 [138, 328] and further supporting evidence was subsequently
provided [359, 360, 361, 362, 363, 349, 350].

in general, equivalent string backgrounds are related by a group of duality transforma-
tions that corresponds to a discrete subgroup of a noncompact, global symmetry of the
eective supergravity actions. these latter symmetries are broken to discrete subgroups
by quantum eects. for example, the type iib supergravity theory in ten dimensions is
invariant under a global sl(2, r) symmetry [179, 351, 342, 201, 203]. the discrete subgroup
sl(2, z) is then the conjectured sduality of the type iib superstring [204]. likewise, the
discrete subgroup o(d, d; z) of the group o(d, d) is the tduality group of the toroidally
compactied string [303, 304, 368, 170, 288, 169, 171].

in this paper we employ the term duality to refer to the continuous global symmetries
of the eective actions. much of the subsequent discussion is based around the sl(2, r) and
o(d, d) symmetries summarized in section 4. these are relevant to the compactied nsns
sectors of the type ii and heterotic eective actions. the former is related to sduality,
since in many settings, the scalar eld  that arises in the nonlinear sigmamodel (4.12)
can be identied with the dilaton and, hence, the string coupling. the group o(d, d), on
the other hand, is relevant to tduality.

5.1 target space and scale factor duality

the simplest manifestation of tduality is found by compactifying a string on a circle of
radius r, where the compactication is associated with a given coordinate x(, ) [225, 337,
5]. (we suppress spacetime indices here for notational simplicity). the compactication
of x is equivalent to the identication x  x + 2mr, where m is an arbitrary integer.
the string worldsheet action (2.1) implies that the bosonic coordinates x(, ) satisfy the
(1 + 1)dimensional wave equation. thus, in general they can be expanded in terms of left
and rightmoving modes, x(, ) = xl( + ) + xr(  ). in particular, the zero modes
of the oscillator expansion can be expressed as

xr =s 
xl =s 

2

2

pr(  )

pl( + )

(5.1)

where pl,r represent the centre of mass momenta. the total conjugate momentum is
p = (pr + pl)/2 and the zero mode of x can therefore be expressed as

x = p  +s 

2

(pl  pr) 

(5.2)

if x is not compact, then the second term in eq. (5.2) vanishes, because for a closed
string the periodicity of x with respect to , i.e., x( = 2) = x(), implies that x
can not depend linearly on , so we must have pl = pr. if x is a compact dimension,
however, this constraint need not apply, because the string can wrap around this direction

32

an arbitrary number of times. wrapping the string around the circle m times stretches it
by an amount 2mr and this increases its energy by a discrete amount.

furthermore, if x is compact, the momentum along this direction must be quantized
in units of 1/r, i.e., p = n/r, where n is an arbitrary integer. it follows that the quantities
pl,r can be of the form

pr =

pl =

1

2 
n 
2 

n +

m!
m!


r

(5.3)

where the arbitrary integer m may now be interpreted as the winding number.

the hamiltonian is given by h = (p2

r + p2

l)/2. it can be seen from eq. (5.3) that this

is invariant under the transformation

r

 



r

,

m  n

(5.4)

the duality transformation (5.4) interchanges the winding modes with the momenta and
simultaneously inverts the radius of the circle. it is referred to as target space duality.

it can be shown that this symmetry is a symmetry of the interacting string if the vacuum
expectation value of the (higherdimensional) dilaton also transforms as [70, 166, 172, 331]

    2 ln r

(5.5)

this implies that target space duality is an exact symmetry of string perturbation theory
because it is valid order by order in the string coupling. in the above example, it implies that
the compactication of a string on a small circle of radius r is equivalent to the compacti-
cation of the string on a large circle of radius 1/r. the symmetry group in this example

is z2. target space duality also implies the existence of a minimal length scale, ls = ,

because a string on scales smaller than this can be considered in terms of a string on scales
larger than ls. the transformation (5.5) leaves invariant the lowerdimensional eective
coupling, in the same way that the lowerdimensional dilaton of the toroidally compactied
nsns string action (4.33) is invariant under the global o(d, d) symmetry transformation
(4.34).

target space duality is closely related to a scale factor duality of the string eective
action (3.18). this latter symmetry is a subgroup of the global o(d, d) symmetry (4.34)
it can be better understood by encoding the d2 data of the
discussed in section 4.3.
o(d, d)/o(d)  o(d) coset in terms of the background parameter matrix

eab = hab + bab,

a, b = 1, 2, . . . , d

(5.6)

the number of independent degrees of freedom in eq. (5.6) is then composed of d(d + 1)/2
from the (symmetric) internal metric, hab, and d(d 1)/2 from the (antisymmetric) matrix
bab. the o(d, d) transformation (4.34) on m is then equivalent to [170, 368, 169, 171]

e  (w e + x)(y e + z)1

(5.7)

33

where {w, x, y, z} are dened in eq. (4.23).
ment
u =  =  0

id

scale factor duality corresponds to the transformation generated by the o(d, d; z) ele-

id

0 !

(5.8)

it can be seen directly from eq. (5.7) that this inverts the parameter matrix e  e1
[170, 368]. in terms of h and b it results in the transformation

h  (h  bhb)1
b  (b  hb1h)1

(5.9)

(5.10)

such that the combination h1b  bh1 is invariant. we see that in the absence of
a 2form potential, b = 0, eq. (5.9) inverts the metric on the internal space, h  h1.
in this sense, therefore, scale factor duality is a tduality. this symmetry has numerous
cosmological implications and is central to the prebig bang inationary scenario [388] (see
section 9).

5.2 relationships between the string eective actions

we are now in a position to explore some of the duality relationships between the ve
superstring theories. we nd hints for these relationships at the level of the eective actions
by counting the relevant powers of e that arise in each of the terms. our discussion follows
the format presented by witten [400]. we begin by considering n = 1, d = 11 supergravity
[107]. we may write the action for such a theory in the schematic form

s z d11xq|g11|hr11  |dc3|2  . . .i

(5.11)

where dots denote the extra terms that arise in eq. (2.13) and, in what follows, dxn denotes
the eld strength of an nform potential, xn. compactication of this theory on a circle
11 = g dxdx + e2(dx11  adx)2 then leads to
s1 of radius r11 = e with the ansatz ds2
a tendimensional action containing the terms [400, 159, 74, 205]

s z d10xq|g10|he(cid:16)r10 + ||2  |dc3|2(cid:17)  e3|da1|2  e|db2|2i  . . .

performing the conformal transformation (see appendix a)

g = eg

rewrites the action (5.12) in the form

s z d10xq|g10|he3(cid:16) r10 + | |2  |db2|2(cid:17)  |da1|2  |dc3|2i  . . .

(5.12)

(5.13)

(5.14)

comparison between the terms that arise in the type iia string eective action (2.9)
and the dimensionally reduced action (5.14) indicates that the terms match [74, 205, 159],

34

in the sense that the powers of the dilaton eld are the same term by term, if we identify
the tendimensional string coupling with the radius of the eleventh dimension [400]:

r3
11 = g2
s

(5.15)

where g2
s = e. this is the rst piece of evidence indicating that the strong coupling limit of
the type iia superstring is related to an elevendimensional theory. indeed, one denition
of mtheory is that it is the strong coupling limit of the type iia superstring [400, 381]. it
has n = 1, d = 11 supergravity as its low energy limit.

we may also consider the strong coupling limits of the other string theories. from eq.

(2.12), the action for the so(32) heterotic string is given schematically by

s z d10xq|g10|ehr10 + ||2  |db2|2  f 2
2i

(5.16)

where f 2
2 denotes the yangmills eld strength. the dilaton-gravity sector of the action
remains invariant under a conformal transformation g = e/2g together with the eld
redenition  =  (see appendix a) and the full rescaled action has the form

s z d10xq|g10|he ( r10 + |  |2)  e /2 f 2

2  |d b2|2i

(5.17)

the terms scale with e  in the same way as in the type i eective action (2.11). moreover,
since the dilaton has eectively gone from  to , the string couplings in the two theories
are related by gs  g1
. this suggests that the strong coupling limit of the so(32) string
is dual to the weak coupling limit of the type i string, and viceversa [203, 400, 318].

s

we now consider the strong coupling limit of the type iib string. for the moment let us
ignore the rr axion eld in eq. (2.10). (a more complete analysis of the global symmetries
of the action is made in the following subsection). the remaining nsns and rr elds
scale with the dilaton as

with the rescalings g = e/2g and  = , this action transforms to

s z d10xq|g|he(cid:16)r + ||2  |db(1)
s z d10xq|g|he (cid:16)r + | |2  |db(2)

2 |2(cid:17)  |db(2)

2 |2  |dd4|2i  . . .

2 |2(cid:17)  |db(1)

2 |2  |dd4|2i  . . .

(5.18)

(5.19)

thus, the two actions (5.18) and (5.19) are equivalent up to an interchange of the nsns
and rr 3form eld strengths. this suggests that the iib superstring is selfdual, in the
sense that the strong coupling limit of this theory can be interchanged with its weakly
coupled limit [204].

it is also interesting to consider the relationships between the dierent theories below
ten dimensions. in particular, it is known that there is only one n = 2 supergravity theory
when d  9 (see, e.g., [398]) and this implies that the type iia and type iib theories
should be related. furthermore, both type ii theories have the same number of massless
degrees of freedom when compactied on a circle. indeed, it can be shown that at the level
of the eective actions, a type iia string background containing one abelian isometry can

35

be mapped onto a type iib string background containing one abelian isometry [74, 42].
the rr sectors of the theories are interchanged by such a transformation and the radii of
the compactied dimension in the two theories are related by the duality r(iia)
10 = 1/r(iib)
in this sense, the type iia string compactied on a circle of radius
(in string units).
r10 is equivalent to the type iib string compactied on a circle of radius r1
10 . this is a
perturbatively exact result and the type iia and iib theories are tdual [165, 112, 110].

10

a similar relationship between the two heterotic strings applies below ten dimensions.
that is, the e8  e8 heterotic string compactied on a circle of radius r is equivalent to
the so(32) heterotic string compactied on a circle of radius 1/r [303, 304, 165]. this is
also a perturbatively exact result. thus, below ten dimensions there are only three distinct
theories  type i , type ii and heterotic. furthermore, the so(32) heterotic string can be
related to the type i string in ten dimensions [400, 318]. can the heterotic and type ii
strings be related in a similar way in lower dimensions?

the heterotic string has n = 1 supersymmetry in the tendimensional setting, whereas
the type ii strings have n = 2 supersymmetries. a necessary condition for the heterotic and
type ii strings to be dual to each other in lower dimensions is that the number of supersym-
metries should coincide after compactication. the number of unbroken supersymmetries
that survive compactication depends on the holonomy group of the internal space. the
metrically at dtorus, t d, has trivial holonomy and admits the maximal number (d) of
covariantly constant spinors [387].

the simplest compact, ricciat manifold after the torus is the k3 surface. this is a
fourdimensional space with holonomy group su(2). it was rst employed as a compacti-
fying space within the context of d = 11 supergravity [115] and has played a central role
in string duality. (for a detailed review of its properties, see [15]). since the k3 manifold
has an su(2) holonomy group, it admits two covariantly constant spinors and therefore
preserves half of the original supersymmetry [194].
indeed, the k3 manifold is the only
fourdimensional space, together with t 4, that admits covariantly constant spinors [387].
consequently, compactifying a n = 2 theory on k3 and a n = 1 theory on t 4 results in
two theories with the same number of supersymmetries.

the metric for k3 exists but is unknown [402]. however, an approximate description
of the k3 manifold is to view it as an orbifold of t 4, i.e., k3  t 4/z2 [313, 164]. the
construction of this space is described in ref. [259]. it involves identifying the coordinates
yi  yi + 2 in 4 (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) and then making the further identications yi  yi.
we now proceed to qualitatively consider the compactication of the heterotic string on
t 4 and the compactication of the type iia string on k3 by keeping the internal dimensions
xed [400]. the heterotic action then has the form

in six dimensions and the type iia string eective action scales as

sh z d6xq|gh|ehhrh + |h|2  |db2h|2  |da1h|2i
siia z d6xq|ga|hea(cid:16)ra + |a|2  |db2a|2(cid:17)  |da1a|2i

after compactication.

(5.20)

(5.21)

36

performing the conformal transformation

ga = eaga ,

(5.22)

on the type iia action leads to an eective theory where all the terms scale as ea, with
the exception of the b2a term. in this case, the scaling goes as ea. however, a 3form
is poincare dual to another 3form in six dimensions. the eld equation for the 2form
potential b2a in the new frame is d(eadb2a) = 0 and this is trivially solved by the
ansatz (d b2a) = eadb2a. the eld equations derived from the type iia action (5.21)
are therefore formally equivalent to those derived from

siia z d6xq|ga|eah ra + | a|2  |d b2|2  |da1|2i

(5.23)

it can now be seen that the two eective actions (5.20) and (5.23) can be transformed
into one another by a suitable identication of the elds [352]. since h = a, the
strong coupling limit of one theory is transformed to the weak coupling limit of the other,
gs(h) = g1
s(a). this is the basis for stringstring duality in six dimensions [400, 118, 117,
119, 120, 204, 121, 364, 191]. it can be shown that string/string duality in six dimensions
follows as a consequence of heterotic/type i duality in ten dimensions [387].

to summarize, there is evidence even at the level of the eective actions to suggest
that the ve perturbative string theories, together with n = 1, d = 11 supergravity, are
fundamentally related by duality symmetries. for consistency, therefore, all theories should
be considered equally. this provides strong motivation for studying the cosmology of the
type ii theories in particular since these contain nontrivial rr sectors. in the following
subsections, we consider the s and udualities of the type iib theory in more detail. this
provides the basis for studying the cosmological consequences of this theory in sections 8
and 10.

5.3 sl(2,r) and sduality of the type iib superstring

the strong/weak coupling sl(2, z) sduality of the type iib theory [204] can be understood
in terms of the compactication of d = 11 supergravity on a 2torus, t 2 = s1s1 [345, 14].
the relationship between the 2torus and the modular group sl(2, z) is summarized in
appendix b. for simplicity, we assume that the torus is rectangular. compactication of
d = 11 supergravity on a circle of radius r1 yields the type iia theory [159, 74, 205], where
the string coupling is determined by ga = r3/2
[400]. the tendimensional spacetimes in
the mtheory and type iia pictures are related by eq. (5.13). thus, compactication of
the type iia theory on a circle of radius ra = g1/3
a r2 is equivalent to compactication of
d = 11 supergravity on a 2torus with radii r1 and r2. the tduality rb = 1/ra then
transforms the d = 9 type iia theory into the type iib theory [74, 42, 165, 112, 110].

1

the eective tendimensional coupling of the type iib theory is determined from the
i.e.,
condition that the coupling in nine dimensions be invariant under this tduality,
g2
b/rb = g2
a/ra. the type iib coupling can then be written as gb = r1/r2. now, the
area of the mtheory 2torus is am = r1r2 and this can be written as am  r1
b . thus,
rb   as am  0. in this sense, therefore, the type iib theory may be viewed as the
compactication of mtheory on a 2torus in the limit where the area of the torus vanishes

37

[345, 14]. moreover, invariance under the simultaneous interchange of the two cycles of the
torus, r1  r2, in the mtheory picture then implies gb  g1
b . this is the sduality of
the type iib theory [204].

the above discussion provides a geometrical interpretation of the sduality of the type
iib theory in terms of a 2torus. this has led to the suggestion that the origin of the type
iib superstring may be found in a twelvedimensional theory, labelled ftheory, that has
been compactied on t 2 [386, 387, 296, 297, 365].

we now establish that the type iib supergravity theory exhibits a global sl(2, r)
symmetry [351]. the symmetry becomes manifest in the tendimensional einstein frame
[203, 345]. performing the conformal transformation

implies that the action (3.55) becomes

gm n = e/4gm n

e/2(cid:16) h (1) + h (2)(cid:17)2(cid:27)

(5.24)

(5.25)

it can be seen from eq. (5.25) that the scalar elds and 2form potentials appear as
pairs. indeed, comparison with the nonlinear sigmamodel action (4.12) implies that the
the dilaton and rr axion elds parametrize the sl(2, r)/u(1) coset. action (5.25) can be
written in a manifestly sl(2, r) invariant form by introducing the metric

and the twocomponent vector

m   e/2

e/2

e/2

e/2 + 2e/2 ! ,
h (1) ! .
h =  h (2)

(5.26)

(5.27)

since the matrix (5.26) satises the constraint m tjm = j, where j is the sl(2, r) metric
dened by eq. (4.10), it follows that action (5.25) may be written as [203]

siib =z d10xpg10(cid:26) r10 +

tr(cid:16) m m1(cid:17)

h t m h(cid:27) ,

(5.28)

the action (5.28) is invariant under the global sl(2, r) transformation [204, 345, 43]:

m = m t ,

gm n = gm n ,

h =(cid:16)t(cid:17)1 h,

where

   d c

b a ! ,

ad  bc = 1.

(5.29)

the 2form potentials therefore transform as a doublet under the sl(2, r) symmetry. the
invariance of the tendimensional einstein metric gm n implies that the string metric gm n
transforms under eq. (5.29) as

gm n e /4 = gm n e/4.

b = e is the string coupling. this is the sduality discussed above. it is intrinsically
where g2
a nonperturbative symmetry because it exchanges the strongly coupled regime with the
weakly coupled regime. it is important to note that the sduality sl(2, z) relates dierent
regimes of the same theory. moreover, the nsns 2form potential is interchanged with the
rr 2form potential under eq. (5.32). this implies that both elds should be treated on
the same level. this has important cosmological consequences, as will be seen in sections
8 and 10.

5.4 uduality of the type ii superstring

thus far, we have seen that the nsns sector of the type ii string eective action com-
pactied on t d1 exhibits a global so(d  1, d  1) symmetry [281], whereas the type iib
theory is invariant under a global sl(2, r) symmetry in ten dimensions [351]. this latter
symmetry interchanges nsns and rr elds. however, the dierent characteristics of the
nsns and rr sectors arise directly from the perturbative formulation of string theory and
the two sectors become unied within the context of elevendimensional supergravity [107].
moreover, since this latter theory exhibits a global sl(d, r) symmetry when compactied
on t d, the toroidally compactied type ii theory should exhibit a continuous symmetry
group gd that is generated by the noncommuting subgroups so(d 1, d 1) and sl(d, r).
the group gd corresponds to a noncompact form of the exceptional group ed, denoted
by ed(d) [101, 211]. the existence of the ed(d) symmetries in maximal supergravity theories
was originally conjectured in [103, 107, 211, 101]. they were then found by direct construc-
tion [338]. it was only recently, however, that the symmetries for all dimensionalities were
obtained directly from the toroidal compactication of the elevendimensional theory [108].
this unied previous works, where the symmetries for the particular cases of d = 9 [42],
d = 4 [103, 107] and d = 3 [295] had been found directly by compactication.

the exceptional groups arise when performing the toroidal compactication down to d
dimensions and poincare dualising all eld strengths with degree greater than d/2 [108].
the identity of gd is deduced by establishing that the scalar elds in the model parametrise
the gd/hd coset, where hd is the maximal compact subgroup of gd. once the identity of
hd and the number of scalar elds present has been determined, the group gd can be found.
the symmetry is a symmetry of the eld equations when the dimensionality of spacetime
is even and is also a symmetry of the action in odd dimensions [108].

another important property is that the symmetry group gd does not act on the uncom-
pactied ddimensional spacetime [204]. this implies that it survives further dimensional
reduction and appears as a subgroup of the larger symmetry group gd , where d > d. the
origin of the exceptional groups can then be understood in terms of the so(d 1, d 1) t
duality and the sl(2, r) sduality of the type iib theory. the discrete subgroups of these
exceptional groups are the conjectured uduality groups of the type ii superstring [204].
the structure of the uduality groups of mtheory are discussed in refs. [309, 108, 8, 9, 10].

39

we now highlight some examples.

in eight dimensions, there is a sl(3, r) subgroup
arising from mtheory on t 3 and a so(2, 2) subgroup arising from the tduality. the
group so(2, 2) is isomorphic to sl(2, r) sl(2, r) [308]. the origin of one of the sl(2, r)
subgroups can be traced to the toroidal compactication of the elevendimensional theory.
thus, the global symmetry is sl(3, r)  sl(2, r) and this is isomorphic to e3(3). in seven
dimensions, the toroidal group is sl(4, r) and the tduality group is so(3, 3). the latter is
isomorphic to sl(4, r) [308] and this does not commute with the other sl(4, r) subgroup.
together they form e4(4) = sl(5, r) [108]. in six dimensions, we have the noncommuting
subgroups sl(5, r) and so(4, 4) and the smallest group containing both is e5(5) = so(5, 5)
[387].

as far as the scalar manifolds are concerned, no dualization of the higher degree form
elds is necessary to establish the coset structure of the axionic scalar lagrangians for d  6.
in these cases, the
the situation is more complicated, however, below six dimensions.
exceptional groups emerge as the symmetry only after the (d  2)form gauge potentials
have been poincare dualized to axionic scalars [108]. the dualization changes the coset
structure to that of e(11d)(11d).

one of the key points of uduality is that it acts on the dilaton, the moduli of the metric
and the axionic scalars that originate from the form elds. thus, the ed(d) symmetry unies
into a single quantity the dilaton, the rr elds and the scalar degrees of freedom arising
from the metric compactication. it is in this sense that uduality maps a strongly coupled
theory compactied on a small dimension onto a weakly coupled theory compactied on a
large dimension, and viceversa. indeed, uduality implies that all the coupling constants
in the theory are equally important. it is inherently a nonperturbative symmetry of string
theory.

in section 8, we consider some of the cosmological implications of uduality within the

context of the type iib theory.

6 higher dimensional kasner cosmology

the perturbative formulation of string theory requires spacetime to be tendimensional. on
the other hand, recent developments indicate that the correct description of the universe may
correspond to mtheory, with a lowenergy limit given by elevendimensional supergravity.
in either case, a consistent cosmology must be able to account for a universe where three of
the spatial dimensions are large relative to the hidden ones. this then raises the question
of relating apparently dierent cosmological solutions in dierent frames.

the purpose of the present section is to survey a variety homogeneous and spatially at
cosmological solutions in various dimensions and frames. we begin by considering vacuum
einstein gravity solutions for a (d + d + 1)-dimensional torus. these solutions represent the
higherdimensional generalization of the kasner solution found in fourdimensional vacuum
bianchi type i models. for d + d + 1 = 11, they represent vacuum cosmological solutions
in the low energy limit of mtheory [214, 20]. interpreting one of the spatial dimensions
as an internal degree of freedom then leads to a (d + d)-dimensional solution of the low-
energy limit of string theory which we refer to as a dilatonvacuum cosmology. we then
reinterpret these solutions as d-dimensional cosmologies, where the d dimensions form a
compact internal space. these dimensions play the role of moduli elds and the solutions
are referred to as dilatonmodulivacuum solutions in the dimensionally reduced theory.
attention has recently focussed upon the ability to reinterpret singular solutions obtained
from the dimensional reduced action by oxidising back up to a non-singular solution in
higher dimensions [162, 240, 136]. at each stage of dimensional reduction the dilaton-
gravity solution can be re-written via a conformal rescaling of the metric as a solution in
einstein gravity with minimally coupled elds. it is also possible that the singular nature of
cosmological solutions in one frame may appear to be non-singular in a conformally related
frame [369, 215, 323].

dierent dilatonmodulivacuum solutions are related by the symmetries of the low-
energy action and provide simple illustrations of the symmetries of the theories. the im-
portance of these solutions is that they represent the critical points in the phase-space of
a wide class of string cosmologies containing additional degrees of freedom [47, 48]. as an
example, in section 6.5, we present homogeneous solutions containing form elds.

6.1 (d + d + 1)-dimensional einstein-vacuum solutions

here we present (d + d + 1)-dimensional cosmological solutions of vacuum einstein gravity.
the gravitational action is given by

s =

1

16gd+d+1zmd+d+1

dd+d+1xpgd+d+1 rd+d+1 ,

(6.1)

where rd+d+1 is the ricci scalar curvature of the (d + d + 1)dimensional manifold with
metric gab and gd+d+1 is the (d + d + 1)dimensional newtonian constant.

we assume the topology of the universe is that of a rectilinear torus with d + d inde-

41

pendent scale factors, ei . the line element is therefore of the form

ds2

d+d+1 = dt2 +

e2 i dx2

i ,

d+dxi=1

and the ricci scalar curvature is given by

rd+d+1 =xi

2i + 2

i + ixj

j .

we also give the alternative curvature invariant

rabcd rabcd = 4xi (cid:16)i + 2

i(cid:17) + 2xj6=i

( i j )2 .

the action (6.1) then reduces to

which can be integrated by parts to yield an eective lagrangian

(6.9)

the equations of motion that follow from varying this lagrangian with respect to each

i have the form

subject to the hamiltonian constraint

l = 0 .

equations (6.7) and (6.8) are readily integrated to yield the powerlaw solutions

i = i0 + pi ln t ,

where i0 are arbitrary constants and the constants of integration, pi, obey the kasner
constraints

p2
i = 1 .

(6.10)

xi

pi = 1 , xi

if the indices, pi , are viewed as coordinates on d+d, the constraints in eq. (6.10) imply
that the spatially at and homogeneous solutions to vacuum einstein gravity must lie on
the intersection of the unit sphere with a xed plane.

the ricci scalar given in equation (6.3) vanishes at all times along this classical solu-
tion, rd+d+1 = 0, as must be the case for any vacuum solution of einsteins equations.

42

nonetheless these solutions may have a curvature singularity due to the divergence of other
curvature invariants. rabcd rabcd is given from eqs. (6.4), (6.9) and (6.10) as

rabcd rabcd = 2"3 +xi

(pi  4) p3

i# t4 ,

(6.11)

which is singular as t  0 except the particular case pi = 1 for one dimension i and
pj6=i = 0 [136]. this particular case corresponds to 11 d minkowski spacetime in rindler
coordinates so that t = 0 is just a coordinate singularity. however we shall see that this
non-singular solution in eleven dimensions can give rise to apparently singular dimensionally
reduced cosmologies [136].

it is sometimes illuminating to rewrite eqs. (6.7) in terms of the overall expansion and

shear of the spatial hypersurfaces, t = constant, given by

and

respectively. the d + d  1 independent degrees of freedom associated with the shear of
the spatial sections can be dened as

and the lagrangian (6.6) can then be rewritten as

the constraint equation (6.8) now takes the form

(6.12)

(6.13)

(6.14)

(6.15)

(6.16)

where the d + d  1 shear degrees of freedom evolve as (damped) free elds, i  ln t, and
drive the expansion,  = 1/t.

6.2 (d + d)-dimensional dilaton-vacuum solutions

we now compare the kasnertype solutions discussed in the previous subsection with the
related solutions that arise in string cosmologies. we begin with the action (6.1) but rst
compactify the theory on a circle and treat the scale factor, d+d, as an internal degree of
freedom propagating on the (d+d)-dimensional manifold md+d. the reduced gravitational
action can be written by extracting the relevant information from eq. (3.10) as

s =

1

16gd+dzmd+d

dd+dxpgd+d ed+d rd+d ,

(6.17)

43

where gd+d  gd+d+1/r dxd+d. this appears to be a rather unusual scalar-tensor theory

of gravity because there is no explicit kinetic term for the dilaton eld, i.e., the eective
bransdicke parameter takes the value  = 0. however, as discussed in appendix a, the
eective bransdicke parameter changes under a conformal rescaling of the metric. when
other matter elds are absent, this conformal rescaling can be arbitrary. in particular, for
the class of conformallyrelated frames dened by

gab = e2 d+d gab ,

(6.18)

where  is an arbitrary constant, the (d + d)-dimensional action (6.17) takes the standard
form of the vacuum bransdicke theory:

s =

1

16gd+dzmd+d

dd+dxpgd+dehrd+d  ()2i ,

 = [(d + d  2)  1]d+d

where

and

 =

(d + d  1)[2  (d + d  2)]

,

[1  (d + d  2)]2

in this frame, the rescaled scale-factors for i < d + d are

i = i + d+d .

(6.19)

(6.20)

(6.21)

(6.22)

and, for the higherdimensional solutions presented in eq. (6.9), they can be written as the
dilatonvacuum solutions

i = i0 + pi ln t ,

 = 0 + k ln t ,

where the cosmic time in the rescaled frame becomes

and hence

and

t  t(1+pd+d) ,

pi =

pi + pd+d
1 + pd+d

,

k =

[(d + d  2)  1]pd+d

1 + pd+d

.

(6.23)

(6.24)

(6.25)

(6.26)

the rescaling of the cosmic time coordinate in eq. (6.24) leads to the singular limit, t  0,
being mapped onto a non-singular past or future innity, |t|  , (or vice versa) when
pd+d  1. a necessary condition for this is thus ||  1.
we are interested here in the special case of string dilatongravity, where  = 1 and
we refer to the rescaled metric gab as the string frame metric. the relevant value of  is
given from eq. (6.21) as

.

(6.27)

d + d  1  1

44

note that there are two possible choices for  corresponding to two dilaton-gravity theories
related by an s-duality transformation, with the dilaton

 = 

d + d  1 d+d .

(6.28)

in the case of the eleven dimensional low energy m-theory action presented in eq. (2.13),
one obtains the d + d = 10 type iia string theory eective action given in eq. (2.9) when
 = 1/2 and  = 310.

the solution (6.23) corresponds to the rolling radii solution rst considered by mueller
within the context of the bosonic string, where d + d = 26 [298]. when  = 1 the
constants of integration (6.25) and (6.26) obey the generalised kasner constraints

d+d1xi=1

pi = 1 + k ,

d+d1xi=1

p2
i = 1 .

(6.29)

these dilaton-vacuum indices in the string frame, pi , lie on the intersection of the unit
sphere with a plane whose distance from the origin depends on the kinetic energy of the
dilaton eld, as parametrized by the constant of integration, k. hence, this constant is
bounded:

 1 

d + d  1  k  1 + d + d  1 .

(6.30)

we recover the general relativistic kasner vacuum solutions in d + d dimensions as a
particular solution when pd+d = 0 and k = 0.

substituting equations (6.23) and (6.29) into the expression for the (d + d)dimensional

ricci scalar,

yields

rd+d =

d+d1xi=1

2i + 2

i + i

d+d1xj=1

j ,

rd+d =

k 2
t2 .

(6.31)

(6.32)

this implies that there is now a singularity in the (d + d)-dimensional scalar curvature as
t  0 whenever k 6= 0. this is true even when pd+d = 1 and the (d + d + 1)-dimensional
einstein-vacuum solution was at minkowski spacetime in rindler coordinates and there
was no curvature singularity. in this case the (d + d)-dimensional cosmology is isotropic.
as noted in ref. [136] is remarkable that regularity in the higher dimensional spacetime
requires isotropy in the lower dimensional spacetime.

on the other hand, note from eq. (6.24) that singular behaviour when t  0 in the
(d + d)-dimensional dilaton-gravity cosmology may correspond to non-singular behaviour
where t   in the (d + d + 1)-dimensional einstein gravity if || > 1 which, from
eq. (6.27), requires d + d < 5. this is another way in which a curvature singularity in the
dimensionally reduced dilaton-gravity solutions may be mapped onto non-singular evolution
in the higher-dimensional einstein-vacuum theory.

we now consider the corresponding solutions for the (d + d)-dimensional einstein met-
ric. from section a.3, this frame is related to the string frame by a further conformal
transformation:

gab = e2/(d+d2)gab ,

(6.33)

45

to arrive at this metric, one may equivalently choose  = 1/(d  2) in equation (6.18).
we emphasize that this metric therefore diers by a conformal factor from the (d + d)-
dimensional part of the original (d + d + 1)-dimensional einstein metric gab. the action
(6.19) then becomes

s =

16gd+dzmd+d

dd+dxpg(cid:20) r

d + d  2

( )2(cid:21)

the solutions for the rescaled scale factors and dilaton eld can be written as

and the proper time for comoving observers in the (d + d)-dimensional einstein frame
becomes

t  t(d+d2k)/(d+d2) .

(6.39)
since the quantity d + d  2  k is positive denite for d + d > 2, t  0 as t  0. the
ricci scalar is given by r = k 2/[(d + d  2)t2], so there is again a curvature singularity
whenever t  0 for k 6= 0.
finally, the generalised kasner constraints in the (d + d)-dimensional einstein frame
become

in contrast to the kasner constraints (6.29), the indices, pi, lie on the intersection of a xed
plane with a sphere whose radius depends on k.

6.3 d-dimensional dilaton-moduli-vacuum solutions

the dilatonvacuum solutions presented in eqs. (6.23) and (6.29) can re-interpreted as
dilaton-moduli-vacuum solutions in a d-dimensional spacetime, where the line element is
given by

ds2 = dt2 +

e2idx2

i ,

d1xi=1

46

(6.42)

the extra d dimensions are now compactied in the form of a ricciat internal space with
a diagonal metric given by ds2
int = habdxadxb (a, b = d, . . . , d + d), where haa = e2a . the
dimensionally reduced action then corresponds to a truncated form of eq. (3.6):

s =zmd

ddxge"rd + ()2 

(a)2# .

d+d1xa=d

(6.43)

there are no vector terms in eq. (6.43) because we have assumed that the internal space
is a rectilinear torus. the internal scale factors, a, may be interpreted as moduli elds in
this action.

the eective kasner constraints for the d  1 external dimensions are

and

 1 q(d  1)(1  b2)  k  1 +q(d  1)(1  b2) .

the eective dilaton in d-dimensions then becomes

   

d+d1xa=d

a = 0 + k ln t ,

when compared with the original dilaton-vacuum constraints given in eq. (6.29), the
dilaton-moduli-vacuum indices, pi, lie on the intersection of a sphere, whose radius now
depends on b2, and a plane, whose position is determined by k. thus, in this interpretation,
b2 is an additional constant of integration that parametrizes the evolution of the moduli
elds, i.e., the internal space.

the d-dimensional ricci scalar curvature is rd = (k2  b2)/t2.
it follows from the analysis of section a.3 that the conformal transformation to the

d-dimensional einsteinframe metric is given by

(6.58)

the ricci scalar is r = [ k2/(d  2) + b2]/t2, so there is a curvature singularity whenever
t  0 for k 6= 0 or b 6= 0.
note that there is a conformal factor relating the d-dimensional einstein metric to the
d-dimensional part of the (d + d)-dimensional einstein metric!

the two dierent possible denitions for the einstein frame are related by a constant rescal-
ing only if the volume of the d-dimensional internal space remains constant in the (d + d)-
dimensional einstein frame.

6.4 symmetries of cosmological vacuum solutions

t-duality: the cosmological vacuum solutions presented above provide a simple illus-
tration of some of the symmetry properties exhibited by the dimensionally reduced string
eective actions. in particular, the compactied action (6.43) is manifestly invariant under
the transformation

a  a ,

(6.60)

for any or all of the d moduli elds a, while the d-dimensional metric, g , and d
dimensional eective dilaton, , remain invariant. note that the d-dimensional einstein
metric, g , given in eq. (6.50), is also invariant under this transformation. this symmetry
is the simplest example of a t-duality and corresponds to the scale factor duality discussed
in section 5. the symmetry is also present in the original (d + d)-dimensional action given
in eq. (6.19) if the geometry is toroidal.

note, however, that the original (d + d)-dimensional dilaton is not left invariant by

eq. (6.60). eq. (6.49) implies that it transforms as     2pa a. thus the (d + d)-

dimensional einstein metric given in eq. (6.33) is conformally rescaled to

gab  e4pa a/(d+d2) gab .

(6.61)

under this symmetry transformation. in terms of the kasner indices in the string frame,
scale-factor duality corresponds to a reection pa  pa. the d-dimensional constants of
integration, b and k, remain invariant which implies from eq. (6.45) that

pa .

(6.62)

k  k  2xa

interesting particular cases arise for the isotropic (d + d)dimensional solution. in this
case, eq. (6.29) implies that pi = p = (d + d 1)1/2 and one of the bounds in eq. (6.30)
is therefore saturated. if we consider the positive root solution and take the dual under
the transformation (6.60) for d of the scale factors, one can verify from eq. (6.62) that
the (d + d)dimensional dilaton eld is mapped onto a constant value by this symmetry
transformation when the dimensions of the spacetime satisfy the relationship [319, 320]

(d  1  d)2 = d  1 + d

(6.63)

solutions to eq. (6.63) are (d = 4, d = 1), (d = 4, d = 6) and (d = 11, d = 15). the
second case implies that an anisotropic cosmology with xed dilaton eld and with three
spatial dimensions expanding and six contracting is dual to the tendimensional isotropic
solution. we shall see in our discussion of the prebig scenario in section 10 era that this
particular case can lead to a scale invariant spectrum of primordial axion perturbations.

s-duality: the d-dimensional compactied einstein action (6.51) is also manifestly in-
variant under the transformation

while the metric, g , and moduli elds, a, remain invariant. this is an example of an
sduality mapping the strongly coupled regime onto the weakly coupled, and viceversa.
this does not leave the string metric invariant and eq. (6.50) implies that

2/5-transformation: the 2/5 transformation is a symmetry of m-theory, whose low-
energy eective action contains the einstein action presented in equation (6.1) with d +
d + 1 = 11. thus the higher dimensional cosmological solutions presented in equation (6.9)
correspond to low-energy solutions in m-theory. when m-theory is compactied on a 3-torus
it is invariant under the 2/5 symmetry which exchanges the m2-brane with the m5-brane
wrapped around the 3-torus [3].

m-theory can be related to type iia string theory with d + d = 10 by compactifying
the 11th dimension on a circle, as discussed in section 2, where the string dilaton  = 310.
these compactied string theory solutions also possess t-duality (scale-factor duality). in
particular, the dilaton-vacuum solutions compactied on a 2-torus (i.e. d = 8 and d = 2)
are invariant under the scale-factor duality 8  8 and 9  9. combined with a
permutation of 8 and 9 this corresponds to the 2/5 m-theory transformation.

the 2/5 symmetry yields a transformation of the kasner indices

while b and k remain invariant in the d = 8 dimensional dilaton-moduli-vacuum solution.

6.5 cosmological solutions with form-elds

we now extend our review of higher-dimensional cosmological solutions to consider the
dynamical role of the form-elds that are also present in low-energy eective actions [383,

1as a result our transformation for the kasner indices diers from that presented in ref. [20] but agrees

with ref. [136].

in general, a tensor eld strength is not compatible with a maximally symmetric space-
time. indeed, there are only two values of n in d dimensions that are compatible with the
assumption of spatial isotropy and homogeneity. these are given by n = d and n = d  1,
respectively. the connection between these cosmological solutions and solitonic p-brane
solutions has been discussed previously [255, 240, 54, 262, 322, 31, 139]. the n = d case
is referred to as the elementary ansatz for the eld strength and the n = d  1 solution as
the solitonic ansatz. we consider both cases separately in what follows and will discuss the
brane interpretation for the case d = 4 in more detail in section 7.1.3.

6.5.1 elementary solutions

in the elementary (or electric) ansatz, the antisymmetric tensor potential b is assumed to
be spatially homogeneous, i.e., it is assumed to be a function only of time, b = b(t). since
the eld strength, h, determines the form of the energymomentum tensor and is derived
from an exterior derivative of b, this assumption is only compatible with a homogeneous
and isotropic spacetime if d = n. the n-form eld strength h is then proportional to the
totally antisymmetric, covariantly conserved n-form . thus, the eld equation (6.72) and
bianchi identity, [h...] = 0, are automatically satised by

h... = qe... ,

(6.75)
where q is an arbitrary constant. this yields h 2 = n!q2e2 and leads to an eective
exponential potential for the eld .
we place our present discussion within the context of the d-dimensional einstein frame,
where h... = qe .... the eld strength leads to an energy-momentum tensor of the
form [see equation (3.36)]

(h) t 

 = 

q2e

51

(6.76)

and for  = 0 [i.e.,  = (d + 2n)/(d  2)], this is equivalent to a cosmological constant.
more generally, although the dilaton and moduli elds are minimally coupled with respect
to the metric in the einstein frame, the antisymmetric tensor eld leads to an eective
potential for :

v ( ) =

e  .

cosmological solutions containing scalar elds with an exponential potential energy have
been widely discussed in the cosmological literature [260, 190, 69, 399, 96].

 for c > 0 we require e > 0 and there is a minimum allowed value of xmin =

the vacuum solutions x  2e||. the form eld dynamically interpolates between
two vacuum solutions whose kasner indices are related by a reection in the line
x = xmin.

 for c < 0 the potential is unbounded from below and there is a runaway solution
where x   and the general solution approaches the e = 0 solution with x 
ln  . if e < 0 there is a maximum value xmax = ln(cq2/e), but for e  0 x is
unbounded from above as well as from below.

6.5.2 solitonic solutions

an n-form eld strength is dual to a (d  n)-form eld strength in d dimensions. this
implies that it is also possible to have a homogeneous and isotropic spacetime when d = n+1
if the eld strength h is dual to the gradient of a homogeneous scalar eld (see section 3.2).
this choice leads to the class of solitonic (or magnetic) cosmological form eld solutions.

the eld equation (6.72) is satised by

h... = e... ,

(6.91)

53

where ... is the covariantly-conserved volume-form in the d-dimensional spacetime. in
particular, the eective energy-momentum tensor for the form eld is the same as that for
a massless scalar eld, , coupled to , with an energymomentum tensor given by

(h)t 

 = e(cid:20) 

1
2

g

()2(cid:21) .

(6.92)

thus, a homogeneous eld, (t), behaves as a sti uid in the (n+1)-dimensional spacetime
with an isotropic pressure equal to the energy density (h) = e 2/2.

the bianchi identity, [h...] = 0, requires

and for a homogeneous scalar eld in a d-dimensional toroidal spacetime (with a line
element given in equation (6.42)), this reduces to the constraint

(e) = 0 .

 = p epi i .

(6.94)

where p is an arbitrary constant. hence, we obtain h 2 = p 2n!e2pi i.
in the d-dimensional einstein frame we have h 2 = n!p 2e2pi i and the eective

the solution for  is analogous to the elementary solution presented in equation (6.90)

(6.103)

we conclude from eq. (6.103), therefore, that the solitonic form eld enforces an upper

between two vacuum solutions that are related by an s-duality transformation,    .

this generic feature proves central in our discussions of cosmological solutions including

7 fourdimensional nsns cosmology

in this section we consider in more detail the cosmological solutions to the four-dimensional
nsns eective action (3.45) or, equivalently, (3.46). the spatially at homogeneous mod-
els correspond to particular cases of the higher-dimensional toroidal kasner solutions pre-
sented in section 6. here we extend the discussion to include spatial curvature and inho-
mogeneity.

recall that the nsns sector is common to both the heterotic and type ii string theories
and is comprised of the dilaton, graviton and antisymmetric twoform potential. in this
section we also include the eects of the breathing mode of the internal space, , in the
actions (3.45) and (3.46). this degree of freedom represents a modulus eld.

7.1 spatially homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies

all homogeneous and isotropic external fourdimensional spacetimes can be described by
the friedmann-robertson-walker (frw) metric. we write the general line element in the
string frame as

ds2

4 = a2()nd2 + d2
o ,

where a() is the scale factor of the universe,  represents conformal time and d2
line element on a 3-space with constant curvature :

 is the

d2

 = d2 +  sin

 !2(cid:16)d2 + sin2 d2(cid:17)

(7.10)

to be compatible with a homogeneous and isotropic metric, all elds, including the pseudo
scalar axion eld, must be spatially homogeneous.

7.1.1 dilaton-moduli-vacuum solutions

the models with vanishing form elds, but time-dependent dilaton and moduli elds, are
known as dilaton-moduli-vacuum solutions. in the einsteinframe, these solutions may be
interpreted as frw cosmologies for a sti perfect uid, where the speed of sound equals the
speed of light. the dilaton and moduli elds behave collectively as a massless, minimally
coupled scalar eld. the scale factor in the einstein frame is given by [292, 93]

where a  e/2a, a is a constant and we have dened a new time variable:

the time coordinate  diverges at both early and late times in models which have   0,
but   ||1/2 in negatively curved models. there is a curvature singularity at  = 0 with

a = 0 and the model expands away from it for  > 0 or collapses towards it for  < 0. the
expanding, closed models recollapse at  = /2 and there are no bouncing solutions in
this frame.

these dilaton-moduli-vacuum solutions follow straight line trajectories in the eld space
spanned by the dilaton, , and modulus, . such an interpretation of these solutions is
important when discussing the more general cosmologies containing nontrivial nsns and
rr form elds in the type iib string cosmology (see section 8.2). the integration constant
 determines the rate of change of the eective dilaton relative to the volume of the internal
dimensions. figures 16 show the dilaton-vacuum solutions in at, closed and open frw
models when stable compactication has occurred, so that the volume of the internal space
is xed, we have  mod  = 0.

note that in an expanding open frw model the (negative) spatial curvature comes to
dominate the expansion. the dilaton approaches a xed value and the solution approaches
at minkowski vacuum in milne coordinates at early or late times as ||  .

7.1.2 dilaton-moduli-axion solutions

the cosmologies containing a nontrivial axion eld are referred to as dilatonmoduli
axion cosmologies. these may now be generated immediately due to the global sl(2, r)
symmetry of the dual action (3.46), as discussed in section 4.2. this symmetry exists
because the dilaton and axion elds parametrize the sl(2, r)/u(1) coset.
in eect, we
apply the sl(2, r) transformation summarized in eqs. (4.18) and (4.19) to the dilaton
modulivacuum solutions presented above. this transformation generates a solution with
a dynamical axion eld from one where this eld is trivial. the dilaton and axion elds
transform under a general sl(2, r) transformation as

e  = c2e + d2e
e  = ace + bde

(7.16)

(7.17)

where the constants {a, b, c, d} satisfy ad  bc = 1. the einstein frame metric acts as a
singlet under this transformation and the original sti perfect uid form of the scale factor
(7.11) therefore holds in this more general case. the modulus eld, , is also invariant.
the string frame metric, however, is not invariant and transforms to

ds2

string = e ds2

string

(7.18)

applying the sl(2, r) transformation to the dilatonmodulivacuum solution (7.14

7.15) therefore yields [93]:

(7.22)

where the exponents are related via

r2 + s2 = 3 ,

(7.23)

and without loss of generality we may take r  0.
in all cases, the dynamics of the axion eld places a lower bound on the value of the
dilaton eld,   . in doing so, the axion smoothly interpolates between two dilaton
modulivacuum solutions, where its dynamical inuence asymptotically becomes negligible.
the timedependent axion solutions are plotted in figures 17 for open, closed and at
models when the modulus eld is trivial (s = 0). when the internal space is static, it is
seen that the string frame scale factors for all three models each exhibit a bounce. however
we still have a curvature singularity in the einstein frame as   0. in the string frame
the fourdimensional metric is non-singular as   0 in the particular case r = 1 [31], but
the dilaton and moduli still diverge in this case leading to the breakdown of our eective
action [126, 217].

the spatially at solutions reduce to the power law, dilatonmodulivacuum solution
given in eqs. (7.147.13) at early and late times. when    the solution approaches
the vacuum solution with 3 cos  = +r, while as   0 the solution approaches the
3 cos  = r solution. thus, the axion solution interpolates between two vacuum solu-
tions related by an s-duality transformation   . when the internal space is static
the scale factor in the string frame is of the form a  t1/3 as   , while as   0 the
solution becomes a  t1/3. these two vacuum solutions are thus related by a scale factor

61

duality that inverts the spatial volume of the universe. we shall see in section 10 that this
asymptotic approach to dilatonmodulivacuum solutions at early and late times leads to
a particularly simple form for the semi-classical perturbation spectra that is independent
of the intermediate evolution.

the solutions in the spatially curved models approach the at solutions only near the
curvature singularity,  = 0. at late times,   ||1/2 in the open ( < 0) models and the
dilaton becomes frozen at a xed value as the curvature begins to dominate the evolution.
indeed, the asymptotic form of the solution in this limit corresponds to the milne form of
at space. this metric plays a central role in establishing the generic initial conditions for
the prebig bang scenario, as we discuss in more detail in section 9. the closed models also
become curvature dominated at late times, but in this case the scale factor diverges in a
nite proper time, because    as   /2.

7.1.3 brane interpretation

the overall dynamical eect of the axion eld is negligible except near   , when it leads
to a bounce in the dilaton eld. within the context of mtheory cosmology, it follows from
eq. (5.15) that the radius of the eleventh dimension is related to the dilaton by r11  e/3
when the modulus eld is xed. this bound on the dilaton may therefore be reinterpreted
as a lower bound on the size of the eleventh dimension.
in models where the modulus
eld is xed, a bounce is also inevitable in the string frame scale factor. this feature may
be understood more fully by drawing on the analogy between these cosmological solutions
and certain solitonic pbrane solutions [261, 262, 262, 322, 31, 32, 254, 255, 240, 209, 54,
176]. (for a review of pbrane solitons, see, e.g., ref.
[121]). in particular, cosmological
solutions have been derived directly from black pbranes by exchanging the time and radial
coordinates of the brane in a suitable regime [31, 322, 240, 255]. this is analogous to
the reinterpretation of the interior solution of the schwarzschild black hole in terms of a
cosmological model [311]. this is possible since the time coordinate becomes spacelike in
such a region and the radial coordinate becomes timelike.
in this sense, therefore, the
interior of a black pbrane may be viewed as a cosmological solution.

it is more convenient in this discussion to employ the language of dierential forms. we

proceed by expressing the frw line element (7.9) in terms of an orthonormal tetrad:

ds2 =

where the oneforms  are dened by

this may be expressed as

(7.27)

(7.28)

for consistency with the frw metric, we had to assume that the dilaton and axion
elds were dependent only on time, t. the vector eld vb is related to the spatial gradient
of the axion and must therefore vanish. this implies that the time components of the eld
strength must necessarily vanish, h 0ab = 0. as a result, a necessary condition on the two
form potential in a frw background is that it must be independent of cosmic time. thus,
all nsns frw string cosmologies are solitonic, in the sense discussed in section 6.5.

the remaining nonzero components of the form eld can now be written as

and this simplies to

h = habca  b  c

h = 6ha3  sin

however, the volume element of a threespace of constant curvature is given by

   sin
 !2

sin d  d  d

(7.29)

(7.30)

(7.31)

consequently, the bianchi identity, dh  0, implies that the eld strength of the twoform
potential must be proportional to the volume form of the threespace, i.e., h = p , where
p = 6ha3 is a constant. this is precisely the type of behaviour exhibited by the nsns
eld strength in the solitonic 5brane solution [163, 200, 31]. the constant p represents the
magnetic charge of the 5brane and in a cosmological context is related to the conjugate
momentum of the pseudoscalar axion eld. hence, the axion eld may be interpreted
in some sense as a membrane wrapped around the threespace of constant curvature. as
the universe collapses, the membrane resists becoming squashed into a singular point and
causes the universe to bounce into an expansionary phase.

this concludes our analysis on the nature of the frw cosmologies. we now proceed to

extend our discussion to include models that are spatially anisotropic.

7.2 spatially homogeneous cosmology

in the frw string models the spatial gradient of the pseudoscalar axion eld is constrained
to be zero due to spatial isotropy. this condition need not necessarily be imposed in some
of the spatially homogeneous and anisotropic cosmologies, however. in this class of models,
the components of the threeform eld strength must depend only on time to ensure that
the energy momentum tensor is homogeneous.

in this section we follow closely the notation of barrow and kunze [25] and place our
discussion within the context of the einstein frame metric. we assume that the dilaton eld
is constant on the surfaces of homogeneity,  = (t). thus, the conformal transformation
(a.21) that maps a given solution from the string frame to the einstein frame, and vice
versa, does not change the geometry of the spacetime, i.e., a given bianchi model is mapped
onto the same bianchi type.

the fourdimensional homogeneous spacetimes are classied into two groups. these
are the bianchi metrics [44, 336, 395] and the kantowskisachs models [233, 220]. the
former admit a threedimensional lie group of isometries that acts simply transitively
on the spatial hypersurfaces [395, 271]. the important features of these spacetimes are
summarized in appendix c. the kantowskisachs universes are dierent to the bianchi
models, because the group of isometries does not act simply transitively on the homogeneous
surfaces.

when discussing bianchi string cosmologies, it is convenient to employ the orthonormal
frame formalism [202, 336]. we also express all eld strengths in terms of dierential forms,
because this allows a more general analysis to be made. we choose an orthonormal tetrad

ds2 = 

(7.32)

for the spacetime metric, where  = diag[1, 1, 1, 1]. the oneforms  are given by
[202, 336]
(7.33)
where b are dened in eq. (c.2),  is dened in eq. (c.10) and the symmetric 3  3
matrices ba
b are functions only of time, t. comparison with eq. (c.1) implies that the
threemetric is given by

a = e(t)ba

0 = dt,

b(t)b

the eld equation for the threeform eld strength is

hab(t) = e2cdbc

abd

b

d(h)  2(d)  (h) = 0

where h is the poincare dual of h, dened in eq. (3.26). eq. (7.35) is solved by

d = e2h

(7.34)

(7.35)

(7.36)

where  represents the pseudoscalar axion eld. eq. (7.36) is equivalent to eq. (3.41).

we may express the oneform d as

d =

1

e2h (t)

(7.37)

or equivalently, as

where

d = u (t)dt + vb(t)b

vb(t) =

the eld equation (7.35) reduces to the bianchi identity dd = 0 and may be directly
integrated to yield the simultaneous constraints [25]

va = ka
bc = 0

vac a

(7.40)

(7.41)

where ka is an arbitrary, constant spatial threevector.

this implies that the spatial dependence of the axion eld is at most linear in the spatial
variables. this is still consistent with the assumption of spatial homogeneity, because only
the rst derivatives of the axion eld arise in the energy momentum tensor, implying that
this tensor is a function of cosmic time, t, only. however, the second constraint (7.41)
restricts the number of nonzero components of ka for each bianchi type. for the spatially
at, bianchi i model, ka may be arbitrary since c a
bc = 0 for this type. on the other hand,
at least one or more of its components must vanish for the other bianchi types.

indeed, eq. (7.41) implies that

(7.42)

(7.43)

and substituting in eq. (c.6) implies that [25]

bcdvac a

bc = 0

va(cid:16)2m ad + accad(cid:17) = 0

where we have employed the properties summarized in (3.2). it is interesting to consider
the bianchi type ix cosmology, since this represents the anisotropic generalization of the
positively curved frw model. for the bianchi class a, where ab = 0, eq. (7.43) implies
that vam ad = 0. remarkably, this equation is identical in structure to the jacobi identity
(c.7). it implies that if va 6= 0, the rank of m ab can not exceed two. however, rank[m ab] = 3
for the bianchi types viii and ix. thus, all three components of the spatial gradient of the
pseudoscalar axion eld must vanish for these bianchi types, i.e., the only possible bianchi
type viii and ix string cosmologies with nsns elds are solitonic, where the axion eld
is constant on the surfaces of homogeneity [27, 25]. in the type ix model, the lie group of
isometries is so(3), corresponding to the threedimensional rotation group. if one of the
components of ka were to be non-trivial, one direction would necessarily be selected over
the others and this would break the rotational invariance of the model.

bianchi string cosmologies have been classied by batakis [27] and by barrow and kunze
[25] under dierent assumptions. both assume that the dilaton is a function only of cosmic
time, t, but batakis restricts the analysis to metrics that are diagonal and of the form given
by eq. (7.32), where b = ab(t)b (no sum implied). barrow and kunze place no restriction

65

on the form of the metric and work within the orthonormal frame given by eqs. (7.32) and
(7.33). batakis classication is characterized by the orientation with respect to the surfaces
of homogeneity of the dual, h. barrow and kunze, on the other hand, assume throughout
that the twoform potential is spatially homogeneous, b = b (t).

in eect, barrow and kunze consider the class of elementary, anisotropic string cosmolo-
gies. they determine the most general form of the eld strength h consistent with their
assumptions for all bianchi models [25]. it is found that the strongest restrictions on the
form of h arise in models with the most general geometries. the threeform can have at
most three nontrivial components. the most general solutions arise for the bianchi types
iii and vih, where the group parameter takes the specic values h = 0,1/2,2. these
solutions contain a total of eight independent constants. this is the necessary number of
independent arbitrary constants that an anisotropic nsns string cosmology must exhibit
if the solution is to be representative of the most general inhomogeneous solution to the
eld equations (7.1)(7.4).

there are three classes of diagonal bianchi string cosmologies in the batakis classica-
tion. these are denoted by x (), x () and x (), respectively, where x refers to the
specic bianchi type and the arrow denotes the orientation of h with respect to the sur-
faces of homogeneity, t [27]. in this picture, these surfaces should be viewed as horizontal.
specic solutions have been presented for all classes in refs. [27, 28, 29, 30]. solutions in
the x () class exist only for bianchi types i, ii, iii, vi0 and vii0. nontrivial cosmologies
are only possible in the x () class if the bianchi type is iii, v, or vih.
the solitonic (magnetic) cosmologies, where the axion eld is purely timedependent,
correspond to the x () class, since in this case the congruences of h are orthogonal to t.
these solutions may be interpreted in the einstein frame as orthogonal sti perfect uid
cosmologies.
in general, orthogonal bianchi models in einstein gravity are characterised
by the condition that the uid velocity vector is orthogonal to the group orbits (surfaces
of homogeneity) [226]. this is important because it implies that the problem of nding
the class of orthogonal bianchi string cosmologies can be reduced to nding the full set
of orthogonal sti perfect uid solutions of general relativity [236]. the corresponding
string cosmologies can then be generated from these seed solutions by employing the global
sl(2, r) symmetry of the nsns action (3.46) in precisely the same manner as outlined in
section 7.1.

suppose, for example, that the spacetime metric is known for a given bianchi model
containing an orthogonal sti perfect uid. when the axion eld is trivial ( = 0), the
dilaton eld is massless and minimally coupled to gravity. its gradient is then related to
the fourvelocity u of the uid by [378]

u =

,,,

(7.44)

where a comma denotes ordinary dierentiation. the equation of motion (7.8) of the dilaton
then reduces to

(7.45)

since the shear matrix ab dened in eq. (c.11) is traceless, eq. (7.45) simplies to

 =

1

g(cid:0)gg ,(cid:1), = 0.

 + 3   = 0

66

(7.46)

after substitution of eq. (c.10). dening a new time coordinate [30]

simplies eq. (7.46) still further:

 z t

dte3(t)

d2
d 2 = 0

and eq. (7.48) admits the general solution

 = 0 + 1

(7.47)

(7.48)

(7.49)

where 0,1 are arbitrary constants.

after the sl(2, r) transformation has been implemented, the string cosmologies are
given by eqs. (7.16)(7.18), where the dilaton is determined by eq. (7.49). the denition
(7.47) implies that  is a monotonically increasing function of t, since dt > 0 if and only
if d > 0. thus, the early and late time behaviour of (everexpanding) orthogonal string
cosmologies may be investigated by considering the limits   0 and   +, respectively.
this applies to all bianchi models with negative spatial curvature, but not necessarily to
the bianchi type ix cosmology.

the simplest homogeneous metric that admits an elementary solution is the spatially
at, bianchi type i model. in this case, the nontrivial components of the twoform po-
tential and the spacetime metric are all independent of the spatial coordinates. this is not
generally true of the metric components for the other bianchi types, as can be seen directly
from table 5 in appendix c. we may therefore integrate over the spatial variables in action
(3.45) to derive an eective onedimensional action. since the topology of a closed, bianchi
type i metric is that of a threetorus, t 3 = s1  s1  s1, the reduced action is invariant
under global o(3, 3) transformations, as discussed in section 4.3.
meissner and veneziano have implicitly found the general form of the elementary bianchi
type i string cosmology by employing this symmetry of the eld equations [288]. here we
briey summarize the derivation of the solution. without loss of generality, we may express
the two-form potential and metric in the form

b =  0
g =  1

0 b(t) !
h(t) !

0

0

0

(7.50)

(7.51)

where b(t) and h(t) are 3  3 matrices. the matrix h corresponds to the threemetric on
the spatial hypersurfaces. the onedimensional action derived from eq. (3.45) when the
modulus, , is trivial is then given by

s =z dte(cid:20) 2 +

tr(cid:16) m  m (cid:17)(cid:21)

(7.52)

where the matrix m is dened in eq. (4.30), the matrix  is the o(3, 3) metric dened in
eq. (4.24) and

action (7.52) is invariant under the global o(3, 3) transformation m = u m u t,  = ,
where u is a constant o(3, 3) matrix satisfying eq. (4.24).

the eld equations may now be written in a manifestly o(3, 3) invariant form. variation
of the action with respect to the nondynamical lapse function yields the hamiltonian
constraint equation

and the eld equation for  takes the form

the eld equation for the matrix m can be derived by employing the general techniques

eq. (7.56) admits the rst integral:

t(cid:16)m  m(cid:17) = (cid:16)m  m(cid:17)
e(cid:16)m  m(cid:17) = a

where a is a constant 6  6 matrix that satises the conditions
m a + am = 0

at = a,

substituting eq. (7.57) into eq. (7.54) implies that

the general solution to eq. (7.57) is found by dening a new time variable [288]

m (t) = m0eat

where m0 is a constant matrix that can be set to unity without loss of generality. finally,
substituting eq. (7.60) into eq. (7.61) and integrating implies that

before concluding this section, we discuss the one remaining homogeneous cosmology 
the kantowskisachs universe [24]. the metric admits a fourdimensional group of motions.

m = exp (ca ln t)

(7.63)

68

however, it is not part of the bianchi classication because the g3 of isometries does not act
simply transitively on the spatial hypersurfaces t [271, 220]. instead, g3 acts multiply
transitively and this implies that it acts on twodimensional surfaces of maximal symmetry.
the curvature of these twospaces is constant and can be positive, zero or negative. the
latter two cases correspond to the lrs bianchi types i and iii, respectively. the positive
curvature case is the kantowskisachs model. it is a closed universe with spatial topology
s1  s2 and reduces to the closed frw model in the isotropic limit. such a model was rst
discussed by kompanyeets and chernov [233]. the line element may be expressed in the
form [220]

(7.64)

ds2 = dt2 + a2

1dr2 + a2

2hd2 + sin2 d2i

where ai = ai(t) are the scale factors of the universe.

barrow and dabrowski have found new kantowskisachs solutions to the nsns eld
equations (7.1)(7.4) for the two cases where the pseudoscalar axion eld is timedependent
and timeindependent [24]. we do not reproduce their results here. as in the orthogonal
bianchi models, the axion eld is equivalent to a sti perfect uid when the former ansatz
is invoked and this solution was considered earlier by mimoso and wands [293]. when the
axion is spatiallydependent, the twoform potential is severely restricted and consistency
requires that the only nonzero component of its eld strength is h0 [24]. this implies
that the twoform potential must be aligned along the two spatial directions associated
with the twosphere.

to summarize thus far, we have presented in section 7.1 the general class of dilaton
moduliaxion frw string cosmologies. these models play a central role in our discussions
of the prebig bang scenario in sections 9 and 10. we have also surveyed in this subsection
the classes of spatially anisotropic solutions that have been discussed in the literature to
date. however, given that our understanding of the geometry of the universe near the string
scale is uncertain, such an approach is necessarily incomplete. it is therefore important to
consider the role played by spatial inhomogeneities in early universe string cosmology. in
the remainder of this section, we discuss techniques that prove valuable when studying
inhomogeneous string cosmologies.

7.3 inhomogeneous string cosmology

the oneloop string equations of motion (7.1)(7.4) for inhomogeneous backgrounds are
very dicult to solve, but further progress can be made by considering models where homo-
geneity is broken along one spatial direction. metrics that admit two commuting space-like
killing vectors satisfy this property and are generically referred to einsteinrosen, or g2,
spacetimes [128].

string models admitting an abelian group, g2, of isometries have a number of impor-
tant physical applications. the spatially homogeneous bianchi types iviih and locally
rotationally symmetric (lrs) types viii and ix admit a g2 group of isometries [380].
these models may be naturally generalized to inhomogeneous einsteinrosen cosmologies
[75]. nonlinear inhomogeneities in the dilaton and axion elds can be investigated and,
in principle, this allows density perturbations in stringinspired inationary models such
as the prebig bang scenario to be studied [389, 65, 280]. the propagation and collision of
gravitational waves in string backgrounds may also be analyzed in terms of g2 spacetimes

69

[1, 2, 45, 133, 46, 375]. furthermore, the collision of selfgravitating plane waves can be
modelled as the time reversal of a g2 cosmology in the vicinity of the big bang singularity
[132, 184]. finally, it has been conjectured that g2 metrics represent a rst approxima-
tion to the general solution of einstein gravity in the vicinity of a curvature singularity
[33, 34, 35, 36]. the high curvature regime is precisely the regime where stringy deviations
from general relativity are expected to be signicant. these models may therefore provide
insight into the generic behaviour of cosmologies at very early times.

a study of einsteinrosen string cosmologies is therefore well motivated. for reviews of
the general properties of these spacetimes, see, e.g., [75, 391, 235]. a number of g2 string
cosmologies were recently derived by employing a variety of methods [134, 26, 88, 89].
barrow and kunze studied an inhomogeneous generalization of the bianchi type i string
cosmology [26] and feinstein, lazkoz and vazquezmozo derived a closed, inhomogeneous
model by applying duality transformations on the lrs bianchi type ix cosmology [134].
clancy et al. have found inhomogeneous generalizations of the bianchi type vih universe
and have studied their asymptotic behaviour [89]. these latter models are interesting
because the bianchi type vih universe has a nonzero measure in the space of homogeneous
initial data and includes the bianchi type iii as a special case. furthermore, as we discussed
in section 7.2, the most general, elementary, homogeneous string cosmologies are the bianchi
types iii and vih, where the group parameter h = {0,1/2,2} [25].
the eld equations (7.1)(7.4) reduce to a system of coupled, partial dierential equa-
tions in two variables when spatial homogeneity is broken along a single direction. unfor-
tunately, these equations are still very complicated. on the other hand, solutions can be
found due to the noncompact global symmetries of the string eective action. when the
metric admits two commuting space-like killing vectors, there exists an innitedimensional
symmetry on the space of solutions that may be identied innitesimally with the o(2, 2)
current algebra [18, 277, 224]. this symmetry reduces to the geroch group, correspond-
ing to the sl(2, r) current algebra, when the dilaton and twoform potential are trivial
[158, 227, 228, 229]. the global sl(2, r) sduality of the action (3.46) is contained within
this symmetry [18]. moreover, we saw in section 4.3 that there exists a global o(d, d) sym-
metry in the string equations of motion when the background admits d abelian isometries
[281]. since the inhomogeneous einsteinrosen models we are considering in this section
admit two commuting killing vectors, the eld equations are invariant under global o(2, 2)
symmetry transformations. this tduality is also contained within the o(2, 2) current
algebra [18].

application of both the s and tduality symmetries leads to new, inequivalent so-
lutions. consequently, an inhomogeneous g2 string cosmology containing a nontrivial
twoform potential may be generated once a dilatonvacuum solution has been specied.
we now employ these noncompact, global symmetries of the string eective action in a
variety of settings and outline a number of dierent approaches that can be taken in de-
riving cosmologies of this type. the principles are similar to those of previous sections.
our purpose here is to highlight the important features of the methods rather than restrict
ourselves to a detailed analysis of specic solutions. we therefore provide a framework for
future study in this topic.

we begin our discussion in the einstein frame and assume throughout that the modulus
eld in eqs. (3.45) and (3.46) is stable. the class of einsteinrosen metrics is dened by

70

the block diagonal line element [75, 391]

ds2 = h(x)dxdx + ab(x)dxadxb,

(7.65)
where {x = , x}, {xa = y, z} and  represents the time coordinate. the functions h
and ab represent the longitudinal and transverse components of the spacetime metric,
respectively, and depend only on the variables  and x. spatial homogeneity is therefore
broken along the xdirection [75, 391]. the two commuting space-like killing vectors are
/xa. the abelian group, g2, of isometries acts orthogonallytransitively and the variables
xa span the surfaces of transitivity. the local behaviour of these models is determined by the
gradient b  detab. cosmological solutions arise if b is globally time-like or when
bb changes sign [380]. when b is globally space-like or null, the solutions represent
cylindrical or gravitational plane waves, respectively [75, 184, 375]. since the longitudinal
part of the metric is conformally at, eq. (7.65) can be written as

ds2 = ef(cid:16)d2 + dx2(cid:17) + ab(, x)dxadxb

(7.66)

where f = f (, x).

the g3 group of isometries for all bianchi types iviih and the lrs types viii and ix
admits an abelian subgroup g2 [380]. these homogeneous models are therefore particular
cases of g2 cosmologies. in these cases, a coordinate system exists that allows the spacetime
metric to be written in the form

ds2 = ef ()(cid:16)d2 + dx2(cid:17) + cd()ec

a(x)ed

b(x)dxadxb

(7.67)

where a, b, c, d = 1, 2 and the functional forms of the ec
a(x) are determined by the specic
bianchi types. inhomogeneous generalizations of these bianchi models may therefore be
considered by introducing a dependence on x in the functions f and cd.

if one of the killing vectors is orthogonal to the surfaces of transitivity, the transverse
part of the metric may be diagonalized. without loss of generality, the metric (7.66) may
then be expressed in the form

where p = p(, x). from eq. (3.19) the corresponding stringframe metric is then given by

ds2 = ef(cid:16)d2 + dx2(cid:17) + (cid:16)epdy2 + epdz2(cid:17)
string = ef +(cid:16)d2 + dx2(cid:17) + e(cid:16)epdy2 + epdz2(cid:17)

(7.68)

where  is the fourdimensional dilaton eld.

in the absence of the twoform potential (axion eld), the einsteinscalar eld equations

for the metric (7.68), where a dot and prime denote partial dierentiation with respect
to  and x, respectively, and it has been assumed that the dilaton eld is independent of
the transverse coordinates, xa. the advantage of employing the coordinate system in eq.
(7.68) is that the eld equations for the transverse component of the metric, p, and the
dilaton, , are identical. indeed, the eld equations (7.70)(7.73) are symmetric under the
simultaneous interchange

p  

(7.74)

moreover, eqs. (7.72) and (7.73) are equivalent to the cylindrically symmetric wave
equation in at space and the general solution to this equation is formally known. the
einstein scalar eld equations (7.70)(7.73) can then be solved, at least up to quadratures,
by integrating eqs. (7.70) and (7.71). integration of eq. (7.70) leads to an expression for f
in terms of an arbitrary function f1(z). in many cases, it turns out that eq. (7.71) is then
automatically solved if f1(z) is taken to be a constant. the problem of solving the einstein
scalar eld equations for a diagonal g2 background is therefore reduced to integrating eq.
(7.70). the general vacuum solution ( = 0) to eqs. (7.70)(7.72) consistent with toroidal
boundary conditions is known [174, 175, 85].

once a dilatonvacuum solution has been found, string cosmologies with a nontrivial
twoform potential can be derived directly by employing the global symmetries of the
model. as in the homogeneous models, one can treat either the twoform potential or
the pseudoscalar axion eld as the fundamental eld. for example, application of the
sl(2, r) transformation (7.16)(7.17) generates an inhomogeneous string cosmology with
a nontrivial axion eld.
in general, the axion eld in this sdual solution tends to a
constant value in the strong and weak coupling limits of the seed solution,   . it is
therefore dynamically negligible in these regimes. as in the isotropic models considered in
section 7.1, this implies that there exists a lower bound on the value of the string coupling
for all inhomogeneous solutions generated by this symmetry transformation.

in view of this, it is important to discuss methods for solving the einsteinscalar eld
equations of motion (7.70)(7.73). a technique for generating solutions with a minimally
coupled, massless scalar eld from a vacuum, g2 cosmology was developed by barrow [23]
and generalized by wainwright, ince and marshman [393]. we now briey summarize the
algorithm. suppose that

ds2 = e2k(cid:16)dt2 + dx2(cid:17) + rhh(dy + wdz)2 + h1dz2i

(7.75)

is a g2 vacuum solution to the einstein eld equations, where {r, h, w, k} are functions of
(t, x). then r satises the onedimensional wave equation

rtt  rxx = 0

(7.76)

where subscripts denote partial dierentiation. the functions {k, h, w} can then be ex-
pressed in terms of quadrature, as discussed above.

it can then be shown that the metric

ds2 = e2k+(cid:16)dt2 + dx2(cid:17) + rhh(dy + wdz)2 + h1dz2i

(7.77)

72

is a solution to the einstein eld equations for a minimally coupled, massless scalar eld,

the transverse space is left unaltered in this procedure and the longitudinal component of
the metric acquires a conformal factor. wainwright et al. originally employed this method
to derive inhomogeneous generalizations of a number of bianchi cosmologies [393], but
the cosmological interpretation of these solutions was subsequently criticized by carmeli,
charach and malin [75].

the global o(2, 2) symmetry of the system becomes manifest in the string frame [281].
for the purposes of the present discussion, it proves convenient to denote the components
of the metric in this frame by g = eg , where g is given by eq. (7.66), and to express
the line element in the form

ds2

string = ef +(cid:16)d2 + dx2(cid:17) + abdxadxb

(7.82)

where ab = eab is the metric on the surfaces of transitivity in the string frame.
determinant,   detab, determines the volume of these twosurfaces.
a subset of the o(2, 2) transformations corresponds to buschers duality symmetry [70].
for each abelian isometry, xa = xa + c (c = constant), associated with a given coordinate
xa, the eld equations are invariant under the discrete transformation

where (,  6= a). in a cosmological setting this transformation may be viewed as a scale
factor duality, since the gaa component of the metric is directly inverted. the odiagonal
component of the transverse part of the metric is interchanged with a component of the
twoform potential. an important feature of eq. (7.83) is that a nontrivial dilaton eld
and twoform potential can be generated directly from a nondiagonal, g2 vacuum solution
of general relativity.

feinstein, lazkoz and vazquezmozo have recently outlined a method for deriving in-
homogeneous string cosmologies that employs the buscher transformation (7.83) [134]. be-
ginning with a diagonal, ricciat, g2 cosmology, odiagonal terms in the metric are

73

generated by employing inverse scattering techniques [34, 35, 193, 196, 231] or an ehlers
rotation [127]. the method of wainwright et al. is then employed to introduce a massless,
minimally coupled scalar eld [393]. the scalar eld and metric are identied with the
dilaton and einstein frame metric, respectively. performing the inverse of the conformal
transformation (a.21) leads to a solution in the string frame with a trivial twoform po-
tential. finally, a nontrivial twoform is generated by applying buschers transformation
(7.83) [70]. this results in a diagonal metric.

feinstein et al. employ this algorithm to generate a closed, inhomogeneous string cos-
mology with s3 topology from a lrs bianchi type ix solution [134, 76]. however, this
algorithm involves a number of nontrivial operations. indeed, it is necessary to solve eqs.
(7.78)(7.80) in order to generate a dilaton eld. a more straightforward approach is to
apply an o(2, 2) transformation directly to the seed cosmology.

to understand how the o(2, 2) symmetry may be applied in this way, it is instructive to
view the inhomogeneous g2 backgrounds as (1 + 1)dimensional cosmologies with a two
dimensional internal space. this is valid when the surfaces of transitivity are closed and
have a toroidal topology t 2 = s1  s1. thus, we may start with the fourdimensional
eective action (3.45) and compactify on t 2. the dimensionally reduced action is given by
the d = 2 form of eq. (4.33) with a trivial eld strength h = 0, since a threeform
must vanish identically in two dimensions.

let us identify the relevant terms in eq. (4.33). it is consistent to assume that the only
nontrivial component of the twoform potential is byz = byz(, x). the moduli matrix
m is then given by eq. (4.30), where

byz

b =  0
0 !
byz
g =  yy yz
yz zz !

(7.84)

(7.85)

and

for a metric of the form (7.82) the relevant o(2, 2) transformation is therefore given by

 =  +

m = umu t
ln(cid:0)/(cid:1)
f = f +   

1
2

(7.86)

(7.87)

(7.88)

where u is an arbitrary, constant o(2, 2) matrix. eq. (7.87) follows because the eective
twodimensional dilaton eld is a singlet under the o(2, 2) transformation. eq.
(7.88)
follows due to the invariance of the longitudinal string frame metric.

as we saw in section 4.3, the four real degrees of freedom {byz, ab} parametrize the
o(2, 2)/o(2)o(2) coset [281, 172, 289, 357, 358, 192]. however, there exists the important
isomorphism
(7.89)

o(2, 2) = sl(2, r)  sl(2, r)

74

and this implies that the four degrees of freedom may be arranged into two complex coor-
dinates [111, 17]:


  1 + i2 =
zz
  1 + i2 = byz + i

yz
zz

+ i

substituting eq. (7.90) into eq. (4.30) implies that

the sl(2, r) subgroups of o(2, 2) are made more apparent by dening the 2 2 matrix

it then follows that eq. (7.91) may be written in the block form

generates the sl(2, r) transformation

,

 = 

(7.100)

that leaves  invariant.

eq. (7.100) leaves the twoform potential and volume of the transverse space invariant.
this sl(2, r) transformation is equivalent to a general rotation and rescaling of the coordi-
nates of the transverse space. in general, it generates a nondiagonal component yz from
a nondiagonal metric, but does not lead to a genuinely new solution. in this sense, it is
similar to an ehlers rotation [127]. on the other hand, it may be employed in conjunction
with the other sl(2, r) transformation (7.99). in particular, it may be employed within
the context of the algorithm of feinstein et al. to generate an odiagonal component in
the metric [134].

eq. (7.99) generates a nontrivial dilaton and twoform potential directly from a vac-
uum g2 solution of general relativity. we now derive a class of inhomogeneous string
cosmologies with this transformation [89]. we take as our seed solution a dilatonvacuum
cosmology of the form given by eq.
(7.69) containing a nontrivial dilaton eld, but a
trivial twoform potential. the volume of the transverse space is given by

the solution generated from a vacuum seed cosmology is determined by specifying  = 0
in eqs. (7.102)(7.106).

in general, the transverse metric in the einstein frame remains invariant under the
transformation (7.99). the determinant of the transverse space in the string frame seed
solution is given by eq. (7.101) and determines the asymptotic form of the dual solutions.
in the limit   0, corresponding to the transverse space having a vanishingly small volume,
the dual metric in both the string and einstein frames tends to its original form if d 6= 0.
similar behaviour is exhibited by the dilaton eld and the twoform potential approaches a

76

constant value. thus, the dual solution asymptotically tends to the original dilatonvacuum
solution in this limit. in the opposite limit   , where the volume of the transverse
space diverges, the twoform potential tends towards a dierent constant value and again
becomes dynamically negligible. the metric and dilaton eld approach the limiting solution
generated by the particular sl(2, r) transformation (7.99) where d = 0.

7.4 mirror images

there exists a further discrete z2 symmetry of the class of g2 string cosmologies that we are
considering [18]. this symmetry interchanges the scalar elds with the transverse metric
degrees of freedom. it becomes manifest in the einstein frame after dualization of the two-
form potential. when the metric is given by the line element (7.65), we may integrate over
the transverse variables in eq. (3.46) to derive an eective twodimensional action of the
form

s =z d2x

he(cid:20)r2 +

2

()2 +

1
4

tr(cid:16)ll1(cid:17) +

1
4

tr(cid:16)nn1(cid:17)(cid:21)

(7.107)

where r2 is the ricci curvature scalar of the (1 + 1)dimensional manifold with metric h,
h  deth,   (ln detab)/2 and both l and n denote symmetric, 2  2 matrices. the
latter is parametrized as usual by the dilaton and axion elds:

n   e

e e + 2e !

e

(7.108)

and the former is dened in terms of the transverse twometric, ab, such that ab  elab.
it may be expressed in the form

l   ep

ep

ep

ep + 2ep !

(7.109)

thus, the scalar functions p and  parametrize a second sl(2, r)/u(1) coset.

this implies that the action (7.107) is invariant under the simultaneous interchange [18]:

or equivalently:

lab = nab,

nab = lab

p = ,

 = ,

 = p,

 = 

(7.110)

(7.111)

thus, the transverse metric degrees of freedom are interchanged with the dilaton and axion
elds and this leads to a new solution with a dierent spacetime interpretation. for
diagonal, dilatonvacuum solutions, where  =  = 0, this transformation reduces to that
given in eq. (7.74).

it should be emphasized that eq. (7.110) is not equivalent to the sl(2, r) or o(2, 2)
transformations discussed above. in the former case, the einstein frame metric is invariant,
but this is not the case when eq. (7.110) is applied. furthermore, the longitudinal compo-
nent of the string frame metric is a singlet under global o(2, 2) transformations, as implied
by eq. (7.88), but eq. (7.110) leaves invariant the longitudinal component of the einstein

77

frame metric. equivalence between the two transformations would therefore require the
dilaton eld to be invariant under eq.
in eect, eq. (7.110) interchanges the
dilaton and axion elds with the components of the einstein frame metric on the surfaces
of orthogonality. the axion eld is interchanged with the odiagonal component, , in
eq. (7.109) and the dilaton eld with the function p.

(7.110).

we now outline how eq. (7.110) may be applied together with the sl(2, r) and o(2, 2)
symmetries to derive inequivalent g2 string cosmologies from dilatonvacuum solutions
[252]. in some sense, these new backgrounds represent the mirror images of the former.
for example, one may begin with the diagonal, dilatonvacuum solution of the generic
form given by eq. (7.69). the axion eld is related to the odiagonal component of the
transverse metric. such a term may be generated from a diagonal metric by employing
the variety of techniques cited above, including the sl(2, r) transformation (7.100). the
simplest method for introducing an odiagonal term in the metric is to perform an sl(2, r)
transformation in the twospace of the killing vectors, /xa:

l = lt ,

   d c

b a ! ,

(7.112)

where ad  bc = 1 and all other variables are invariant [127, 184]. the transverse metric
(7.109) then transforms to

ep = c 2ep + d2ep
acep + bdep
c 2ep + d2ep .

 =

(7.113)

(7.114)

eq. (7.112) does not commute with the discrete transformation (7.110) and the two may
be employed together to generate the axion eld. application of eq. (7.111) then implies
that the mirror image will correspond to a string cosmology with a nontrivial axion eld
and a diagonal transverse metric.

the same procedure applies when determining the mirror images of any vacuum, g2
background of the form given in eq. (7.68). in these cases, the new spacetime will have
no preferred direction in the transverse space because p =  = 0. this will correspond
to a lrs, g2 cosmology, where there exists a oneparameter isotropy group in addition
to the g2 abelian isometry group. alternatively, one may begin with the dilatonaxion
solutions generated from the global sl(2, r) transformations (4.22). the mirror solution
will correspond to a nondiagonal, dilatonvacuum solution. a new axion eld may be then
be excited by a further sl(2, r) transformation (4.22).

we now discuss an interesting application of this z2 transformation. let us rst con-
sider the mirror image of the vacuum bianchi type i cosmology. the general, spatially
homogeneous vacuum solution with a simply transitive lie group g3 = 3 is the type i
kasner metric [221]:

ds2 = dt2 + t2p1dx2 + t2p2dy2 + t2p3dz2,
i = 1 (see section 6.1). applying eqs. (7.112) and eq. (7.111)

(7.115)

i=1 p2

where p3

i=1 pi = p3

yields the lrs type i solitonic string cosmology:

ds2 = dt2 + t2p1dx2 + tp2+p3(cid:16)dy2 + dz2(cid:17)

78

 = lnhc 2tp3p2 + d2tp2p3i

actp3p2 + bdtp2p3
c 2tp3p2 + d2tp2p3

 =

(7.116)

and, when p2 = (1  3)/3 and p3 = (1 + 3)/3, this reduces to the general, spatially at

frw string cosmology presented in section 7.1 [93].

the mirror symmetry (7.110) provides a remarkably simple way of deriving this and
other important string cosmologies. for example, we may consider the mirror image of a
bianchi type v solution. the bianchi type v model represents one of the simplest homo-
geneous, spatially anisotropic models. it may be viewed as the anisotropic generalization
of the negatively curved frw universe and reduces to it in the isotropic limit [271, 336].
the oneforms for this model are given in table 5.

a vacuum solution (r = 0) was found by joseph [210]:

ds2 = sinh 2t(cid:16)dt2 + dx2 + e2xh(tanht)

3 dy2 + (tanht)3 dz2i(cid:17)

(7.117)

and we may derive the mirror image of this vacuum universe by applying the transformations
(7.112) and (7.110). it is given by [252]

ds2 = sinh 2thdt2 + dx2 + e2x(cid:16)dy2 + dz2(cid:17)i
3i
 = lnhc 2 (tanht)3 + d2 (tanht)
3
ac (tanht)3 + bd (tanht)
3
c 2 (tanht)3 + d2 (tanht)

 =

.

(7.118)

it can be shown after an appropriate redenition of the variables that eq. (7.118) corre-
sponds precisely to the general form of the negatively curved frw string cosmology that
we discussed in section 7.1 [93, 252]. this highlights the important point that the mirror
image has a dierent spacetime interpretation to that of the seed solution. in particular, an
anisotropic cosmology is mapped onto a spatially isotropic cosmology by the transformation.

7.5 tilted string cosmology

we conclude this section by applying the techniques discussed above to derive a class of
models that exhibit some interesting properties. we begin our discussion with the bianchi
type vih vacuum cosmology found by ellis and maccallum [131]:

ds2 = sinh 2thab(cid:16)dt2 + dx2(cid:17) + ae2(1+b)xdy2 + a1e2(1b)xdz2i ,

(7.119)

where

(7.120)
and b2  1/h. this reduces to the joseph type v solution (7.117) when b = 0 [210]. the
mirror image of the ellismaccallum type vih cosmology is given immediately by

a  (sinh 2t)b (tanht)

3+b2

ds2 = sinh 2thab(cid:16)dt2 + dx2(cid:17) + e2x(cid:16)dy2 + dz2(cid:17)i ,

(7.121)

79

where the dilaton and axion elds are given by the right hand sides of eqs. (7.113) and
(7.114), respectively, with

ep = (sinh 2t)b (tanht)

3+b2

e2bx.

(7.122)

a calculation of the structure constants of the isometry group of eq. (7.121) implies
that it is a bianchi type v cosmology. as in the above examples, the geometry of the two
spacetimes is dierent. moreover, the metric exhibits a oneparameter isotropy group, since
the transverse space is isotropic, and this implies that eq. (7.121) corresponds to a lrs
type v cosmology. however, the interesting feature of the solution (7.121)(7.122) is that
the dilaton eld has a direct dependence on one of the spatial variables. consequently, it is
not constant on the surfaces of homogeneity, t, and the solution is therefore not contained
within the class of models discussed in section 7.2.

we have discussed previously how dilatonaxion solutions may be interpreted in the
einstein frame as sti perfect uid models. when the axion eld is trivial, for example,
spatial homogeneity implies that the energymomentum tensor of the dilaton eld can
depend only on time. in particular, its energy density must be constant on t. however,
this does not necessarily imply that the dilaton eld itself should be constant on these
surfaces. if it is, then the uid ow is orthogonal to t. if, on the other hand, the dilaton
is not constant on these surfaces and exhibits an appropriate spatial dependence, the uid
ow will not be orthogonal to t. in this case, the model is said to be tilted [226]. a tilted
model is spatially homogeneous as seen by an observer with a world line orthogonal to t,
but appears inhomogeneous to an observer comoving with the uid [90].

the solution (7.121) may therefore be interpreted as a tilted lrs bianchi type v string
cosmology. a more general tilted type v string cosmology that does not exhibit local
rotational symmetry may be generated from the duality symmetries of section 7.3 [88]. a
tilted type v sti perfect uid solution to einstein gravity was found by maartens and nel
[270], and discussed further by wainwright et al. [393]. the metric is given by

where the longitudinal and transverse components of the metric have the form

ds2

f =

e = ef(cid:16)dt2 + dx2(cid:17) + e2x sinh 2t(cid:16)epdy2 + epdz2(cid:17)
2(cid:16)m2 + 2 + 2  1(cid:17) ln sinh 2t +  tanh t

p = m ln tanh t

(7.123)

(7.124)

(7.125)

(7.126)

respectively, and the constants {, , m} satisfy the constraint

2  2 + m2 = 3

the uid fourvector is given by eq. (7.44), where the scalar quantity, , has the form

 = 2x +  ln sinh 2t +  ln tanh t

(7.127)

the metric (7.123) and scalar (7.127) may be interpreted in our context as the einstein
frame metric and dilaton eld, respectively. the uid ow is not orthogonal to the group

80

orbits if  6= 0 and the cosmology is in general tilted. it is orthogonal when  = 0 and
reduces to the joseph vacuum solution (7.117) when  =  = 0.
we have written the solution (7.123)(7.127) in such a way that the g2 group of abelian
isometries is manifest. we may therefore generate a new solution from this seed by applica-
tion of the global o(2, 2) symmetry (7.86)(7.88). we consider the sl(2, r) transformation
(7.99). the dual metrics in the string and einstein frames are

ds2

1/2

s = ef +(cid:16)dt2 + dx2(cid:17) +

d2 + c2(cid:16)epdy2 + epdz2(cid:17)
e = ef(cid:16)d2 + c2(cid:17)(cid:16)dt2 + dx2(cid:17) + 1/2e(cid:16)epdy2 + epdz2(cid:17) ,

and

ds2

respectively, where

 = e24x sinh2 2t

(7.128)

(7.129)

(7.130)

and f and  are given by eqs. (7.124) and (7.127). the twoform potential and dilaton
eld are given by eqs. (7.103) and (7.104).

in general, the dual solution (7.129) does not preserve the oneforms of the bianchi
type v metric. two of the oneforms are left invariant, but the third, given by dx, can
not be multiplied by a function of x if the spacetime is to remain homogeneous. since the
longitudinal component of the metric (7.129) is xdependent, homogeneity is broken along
this direction and the solution therefore represents an inhomogeneous g2 cosmology. in the
limit where   0, however, the original homogeneous solution is recovered for d 6= 0.
on the other hand, the determinant  is independent of the spatial coordinates when
 = 1. in this case, we have  = tanh2t and the einsteinframe metric is of the bianchi
type v. the model is tilted because the dilaton has a linear dependence on the spatial
variable x. this implies that the stringframe metric (7.128) is inhomogeneous, because
the longitudinal component of this metric acquires a spatial dependence from the dilaton
eld.

the latetime behaviour of the string cosmology (7.128) is particularly interesting. in
the limit that t  +,   1. this implies that the twoform potential asymptotically
tends to a constant value and the dilaton tends to its original form, modulo an arbitrary
constant shift in its value. we may specify d2 + c2 = 1 without loss of generality and the
original seed solution (7.123) is therefore recovered in this limit.

it is instructive to dene a new coordinate pair:

1
2
1
8

u 
v 

e2(tx)

e2(t+x)

the line element (7.123) then tends to the rosen form of a plane wave [184]:

after a trivial rescaling of the transverse coordinates and the dilaton eld becomes null:

ds2

e = dudv + u(cid:16)dx2 + dy2(cid:17)

(7.131)

 = 0  ln u

81

(7.132)

where 0 is a constant.

the dilaton eld (7.132) and metric (7.131) are independent of the variable v and the
solution admits a covariantly constant, null killing vector eld, l, such that ll = l =
0. since the gradient of the dilaton eld is proportional to l, the oneloop function
equations reduce to the single constraint ruu = ()2 /2 when expressed in terms of the
einsteinframe variables. it can be veried by direct substitution that this constraint is
identically satised. thus, the asymptotic form of the tilted solution in the latetime limit
is itself an exact solution to the oneloop function equations.

moreover, all higherorder terms in the model perturbation theory are secondrank
tensors constructed from powers of the riemann tensor, the gradient of the dilaton eld,
the metric, the threeform eld strength and their covariant derivatives [183, 317]. it can be
shown by applying a geometrical argument due to horowitz and steif [199] that a planewave
background of the form (7.132) and (7.131) acquires no corrections because the riemann
tensor is orthogonal to l and  on all its indices and because  is proportional to l.
consequently, the asymptotic solution (7.132) and (7.131) represents an exact solution to
the classical string equations of motion to all orders in the inverse string tension.

8 type iib cosmology with ramondramond fields

the symmetries of the type ii string theories have a number of important applications in
cosmology. in particular, they may be employed to investigate the eects of rr elds on the
classical dynamics of the universe and the generation of primordial density perturbations.
in section 5.3 we discussed how the equations of motion of n = 2, d = 10 type iib
supergravity are symmetric under global sl(2, r) transformations [351, 203]. these relate
the strong and weakcoupling regimes of the theory and interchange the nsns and rr
charges.

moreover, type iia and iib supergravity theories are equivalent after toroidal compact-
ication. compactication of the low-energy eective type iib action on a sixtorus results
in n = 8 supergravity, which may also be derived by toroidally compactifying n = 1,
d = 11 supergravity on a seventorus [103, 107]. this theory contains seventy scalar and
pseudoscalar elds that parametrize the e7(7)/[su(8)/z2] coset and the eld equations are
invariant under the global action of the group e7(7) [107]. the discrete subgroup e7(7)(z)
is the conjectured uduality of the type ii superstring and contains the tduality group
o(6, 6; z) and sduality group sl(2, z) [204].

one of the main purposes of the present section is to consider the cosmology of the four
dimensional action (3.56). this action was derived by compactifying the tendimensional
theory (3.55) on an isotropic six torus under the assumption that all elds are independent
of the internal coordinates. the vector elds arising from the metric components and the
moduli originating from the compactication of the form elds were neglected. in eect,
we reduced each form eld to a single degree of freedom.

this action may be viewed as a truncated sector of the d = 4, n = 8 supergravity
theory. the motivation for considering such an action is that it maintains enough simplicity
that exact solutions to the eld equations can be found analytically and analyzed in detail,
but is suciently general that all the non-trivial interactions between the nsns and rr
form elds on the external fourdimensional spacetime are preserved.

82

we draw together much of the material discussed in previous sections. our approach
in establishing the generic features of cosmologies of the type iib theory is to employ the
global symmetries exhibited by the eld equations. this represents an extension of the
method employed in section 7.1 to derive the general solitonic frw string cosmologies
with a nontrivial nsns axion eld. the symmetries of the eld equations derived from
action (3.56) become manifest in the einstein frame after the threeform eld strengths
have been dualised to oneforms. the dual action is given by eq. (3.71). we show that the
ve scalar and pseudoscalar axion elds parametrize the sl(3, r)/so(3) coset and this
action therefore exhibits a noncompact, global sl(3, r) symmetry. the global sl(2, r)
symmetry of the d = 10 supergravity action is preserved in four dimensions as a subgroup of
this sl(3, r) symmetry. a discrete z2 symmetry can also be identied as a subgroup of the
full o(6,6;z) tduality, which leads to a further sl(2, r) symmetry that may be viewed as
a mirror image of the original sl(2, r) symmetry. the sl(3, r) symmetry corresponds to
a subgroup of the (continuous) uduality group e7(7) of n = 8 supergravity. consequently,
the concepts of uduality may be applied in a cosmological setting.

8.1 global symmetries

8.1.1 sl(3,r) symmetry

the eective action (3.71) can be expressed as a fourdimensional, nonlinear sigmamodel
in the form given by eq. (4.3). we write it here as

s4 =z d4xghr  ij()iji ,

(8.1)

where the scalar elds i = (, , , 1, 2), (i, j) = (1, 2, . . . , 5) may be viewed as coordi-
nates on the target space with metric

(8.2)

eq. (8.2) is formally identical to the target space considered by galtsov, garcia and
kechkin within the context of vedimensional kaluzaklein theory admitting two com-
muting killing vectors [145]. maison rst showed that this target space represents the
sl(3, r)/so(3) coset corresponding to a homogeneous symmetric riemannian space, where
the group sl(3, r) acts transitively [283].
it can be shown by employing the gauss de-
composition of the general sl(3, r) matrix that the action (3.71) may be written in the
form [145]

is a symmetric sl(3, r) matrix.

we may conclude, therefore, that the dual action (3.71) is invariant under global sl(3, r)
transformations. these correspond to uduality transformations because they relate the
modulus eld that arises from the toroidal compactication with the four-dimensional string
coupling (dilaton eld). we now consider the relevant sl(2, r) subgroups that prove useful
in generating cosmological solutions with nontrivial rr and nsns elds.

8.1.2 sl(2,r) symmetry

the eective fourdimensional action (3.71) still exhibits the global sl(2, r) symmetry of
the full tendimensional action manifest in eq. (3.55) [278, 335]. this becomes apparent
by dening new scalar elds:

this corresponds to the sl(2, r) transformation

m = m t ,

g = g ,

 =(cid:16)t(cid:17)1

,

v = v.

(8.14)

the transformation (8.14) acts nonlinearly on the scalar elds u and :

eu = c 2eu + (d + c)2eu
eu = aceu + (b + a)(d + c)eu

and the pseudoscalar axion elds transform as

1 = a1 + b2
2 = c1 + d2.

(8.15)

(8.16)

(8.17)

(8.18)

when c = b = 1 and a = d = 0, eq. (8.14) interchanges the two axion elds,
i, and inverts the tendimensional string coupling gs = exp( ) = g1
s = exp() that
is dened in terms of the tendimensional dilaton,  = 2u. thus, the stronglycoupled
regime of the theory is mapped onto the weaklycoupled one, and viceversa. the eective

fourdimensional dilaton eld (3.49) transforms as  = /2 + 3v/4.

we refer to this as the sl(2, r) symmetry. it is the sl(2, r) symmetry of the ten
dimensional theory written in terms of the fourdimensional variables [278, 335]. the eld
v determines the conformal factor

2 = e/4 = e

3(3)/4

(8.19)

that relates the fourdimensional einstein metric to the corresponding part of the ten
dimensional einstein metric (5.24). the invariance of both v and the fourdimensional met-
3v/2g , of the tendimensional
ric g implies that the corresponding components, g = e
einstein metric are also invariant. the radius of the internal space in the tendimensional
einstein frame is ev/3 and the complete tendimensional einstein metric (5.24) is there-
fore invariant, as in eq. (5.29).

finally, we note that although a general sl(2, r) matrix of the form given in eq. (5.30)

has three independent real parameters, there is a two-dimensional sub-group,

0   a1

b a ! ,

0

(8.20)

which leaves the lagrangian (3.71) invariant term by term. these transformations corre-
spond either to a constant shift or rescaling of the axion elds, such that the three four-

vectors, ek, e(+3)/2(j+k) and e(3)/2(l2k) remain invariant. thus

the only non-trivial transformation is the boost

1   cosh 

sinh 

sinh 

cosh  ! ,

(8.21)

which introduces at most one new parameter .

we can employ the sl(2, r) symmetry of the action to generate new four-dimensional
solutions of the eld equations. for example, in section 8.2.1 we derive the homogeneous
cosmological solutions with non-trivial  eld by applying the transformation given in
eq. (8.14) to the homogeneous dilaton-moduli-vacuum solutions discussed in section 7.1.

85

8.1.3 z2 and sl(2,r)2 symmetry

the importance of the dual action (3.71) is that a further sl(2, r) symmetry may be
uncovered. the nsns sector of the reduced action (3.56) is invariant under the t
duality transformation  = , corresponding to an inversion of the internal space. this
z2 symmetry can be extended to the rr sector of the theory and the dual action (3.71) is
symmetric under the discrete transformation

 = ,

 = 2,

2 = ,

1 = 1 + 2,

(8.22)

where the fourdimensional dilaton, , and fourdimensional einstein frame metric remain
invariant. note, however, that because the volume of the internal space changes, the ten
dimensional einstein frame metric (related to the fourdimensional einstein frame metric
by the conformal factor given in eq. (8.19)) is not invariant under this transformation. in
terms of the conserved axion currents, dened in eqs. (3.75), (3.76) and (3.83), the reection
symmetry (8.22) corresponds to

 = ,

k = k,

j = l,

l = j.

(8.23)

this reection symmetry implies the existence of an alternative sl(2, r) symmetry in
the dual action which can be obtained from a combination of the sl(2, r) transformation
given in eq. (8.14) plus the reection symmetry in eq. (8.22). analogously to eqs. (8.5)
and (8.6), but with   , we introduce the new scalar elds:

(8.34)

we refer to this as the sl(2, r)2 symmetry of the action. it should be emphasised that
this is not the tendimensional sl(2, r) symmetry recast in terms of the fourdimensional
action. the sl(2, r)2 transformation mixes the 2 axion eld with w. this latter eld
is not the tendimensional dilaton, because it includes an additional contribution from the
modulus eld, . thus, the radius of the internal dimensions transforms non-trivially and
the tendimensional einstein metric is not invariant under (8.30).

comparison of eq. (8.5) with eq. (8.24) and eq. (8.6) with eq. (8.25) implies that the
discrete transformation    is equivalent to u  w and v  x. moreover, eqs. (5.26)
and (8.27) imply that the reection symmetry (8.22) is equivalent to m  p . thus, the
sl(2, r)2 symmetry transformation is formally equivalent to the z2 transformation (8.22),
followed by the sl(2, r) transformation (8.14), followed by another z2 transformation
(8.22).

it should be emphasized that neither of the symmetries (8.14) or (8.30) coincide with
the sl(2, r) symmetry (7.16)(7.17) of the nsns sector alone. the latter mixes the four
dimensional dilaton and the ns-ns axion [369, 359]. this symmetry is broken due to the
interaction of the rr elds.

8.2 cosmological models

8.2.1 cosmology with a single rr field

we now discuss the cosmology of rr elds. the eld equations with a single nsns or
rr formeld can be directly integrated to yield simple analytic expressions [93, 94, 261,
262, 257, 254, 97]. solutions with more than one formeld have also been found where the
system reduces to an integrable toda model [261, 262, 257, 254, 212, 98, 99]. including the
interactions between the nsns and rr formelds on the external space leads in general
to a more complicated system. however, it is still integrable due to the symmetries between
the elds. the solutions presented in this subsection generalize those previously obtained by
a single sl(2, r) transformation acting on the nsns sector solutions discussed in section
7.1 [322].

the equations of motion for the ve scalar elds in the action (3.71) are given by eqs.
(3.69)(3.70) and by eqs. (3.72)(3.74). we consider the frw models with arbitrary spatial
curvature dened by the line element (7.9). for consistency we require the pseudoscalar
axion elds to be spatially independent and the cosmologies must therefore be solitonic.

2 = 2  1.
the general solution with non-trivial  and constant i (i.e., vanishing threeform eld

where e  |(d + c)/c|. the introduction of a nonconstant  eld places a lower bound
on u, and hence the tendimensional dilaton eld,  = 2u. a typical solution with  6= 0
is shown in fig. 8. the rr eld interpolates between two asymptotic vacuum solutions
where   0. trajectories that come in from innity (u  ) at an angle 1 = , where
/6    5/6, are then reected in the line u = u = ( + 3)/2 and emerge at an
angle 2 = (2/3)  .

89

the mirror image of the 

6= 0 solution under the reection symmetry eq. (8.22) is
a solution with 2 6= 0 and  = 0. because the t-duality, eq. (8.22), leaves the four
dimensional dilaton, , as well as the fourdimensional einstein frame metric invariant, we
nd that the evolution of both , and thus the original string frame metric, is the same for
a single excited rr eld regardless of whether it is  or 2 that is excited.

the solution with 2 6= 0, can also be generated by applying the transformation (8.30)
to the dilatonmodulivacuum solutions in eqs. (7.137.15). this transformation leaves
 = 0 but leads to 1 = 2 and, consequently, to h (1) = 0 and h (2) 6= 0. note that 1 is
only constant when  = 0. there is a lower bound on the eld w, and the generic behaviour
of  and  for this solution is plotted in fig. 8. the rr formeld again leads to a solution
that interpolates between two asymptotic vacuum solutions, where 2  0. trajectories
that come from innity (w  ) at an angle 1 = , where 5/6    /6, are
reected in the line w = w = (  3)/2, and emerge at an angle 2 = (2/3)  .
for completeness we note that eqs. (8.418.44) also represent a solution with  = 1
(see table 3) which is the general dilatonmoduliaxion solution presented in eqs. (7.19)-
(7.22). for  = 0 this corresponds to vanishing rr eld strengths and an excited nsns
three-form eld strength, h (1). note that for  6= 0 (but constant) this corresponds to a
particular solution with non-vanishing rr three-form eld strength h (2) = h (1) [see
eqs. (3.66) and (3.67)]. the typical evolution of the elds  and  is shown in fig. 8. the
presence of a non-vanishing 1 enforces a lower bound on the value of the fourdimensional
dilaton,   . trajectories that come from innity (  ) at an angle 1 = , where
/2    /2, are reected in the line  =  back out at an angle 2 = . no
trajectories can reach    unless 1 = 0 [93].

8.2.2 cosmology with two rr fields

we now consider solutions where two of the formelds are non-vanishing but the third
is zero. the eld equations (8.358.39) imply that the only consistent solution of this
type arises when h (1) = 0. from eq. (3.66), 1 = 2 and this allows 1 to be eliminated.
eqs. (8.37) and (8.38) may be integrated directly to yield a2e+3 = l and a2e32 =
j, where j and l are arbitrary constants. dening a new time parameter t r  d/a2 
ln|| and new variables q    (/3) implies that the eld equations for the dilaton

and moduli may be expressed as

q = j 2eq+2q
q+ = l2eq2q+

as in the single form-eld solutions discussed above, the asymptotic solutions correspond
to straight lines in the (, ) plane (see fig. 9). we see that trajectories that come
from innity (  ) at an angle  are reected back out at an angle . this is
exactly the qualitative behaviour of the nsns dilatonmoduliaxion solution (7.19)(7.22).
however, the range of allowed asymptotic trajectories is more restricted than in the pure
nsns case. the potential in the constraint eq. (8.49) is bounded from above and we

therefore require that the value of the modulus eld is also bounded such that ||  /3
asymptotically. thus, the asymptotic solutions are restricted to the range /6    /6,

the general frw solutions to the type iib string action presented in eq. (3.71) can in
principle be generated from the dilatonmodulivacuum solutions (7.137.14) by a general
sl(3, r) transformation. this is equivalent to the three (noncommuting) sl(2, r) trans-
formations sl(2, r)  sl(2, r)2  sl(2, r). such a sequence of transformations yields
a solution that is analytically very complicated. the generic feature of the solution is that
it exhibits a sequence of bounces between asymptotic vacuum states. a typical trajectory
is shown in figs. 9 and 10. we nd that the timedependence of the elds  and 2 in-
duces lower bounds on the variables u and w, respectively, as seen in the single formeld
solutions. in the general solution this results in a lower bound on  = u + w.

the general type iib cosmology contains a non-vanishing nsns formeld, but can
always be obtained from a toda system with h (1) = 0 by a single sl(2, r) transforma-
tion (8.14). the asymptotic behaviour of  and  is invariant under this transformation.
this follows since u   asymptotically for all solutions in the toda system2 and, from
eq. (8.45), we obtain u  u in the general solution. we also have v = v and thus  and
 are invariant in this limit. thus, trajectories in (, ) eld-space come in at an angle 
and leave at an angle , where /6    /6.

though not necessarily u, but the qualitative behaviour is the same.

8.2.4 anisotropic rr cosmology

the symmetry transformations described in section 8.1 may be employed to generate solu-
tions with nontrivial nsns and rr form elds from any given solution to the dilaton
modulivacuum eld equations [98, 99]. we now extend the analysis to the spatially ho-
mogeneous but anisotropic bianchi universes discussed in appendix c. a lagrangian for
the bianchi class a models may be derived from the dual action (3.71) by integrating over
the spatial variables. if we assume that all scalar elds are homogeneous on the spatial hy-
persurfaces (the solitonic ansatz), it follows that the reduced action is given in the einstein
frame by

(8.57)

the scalar curvature of the threesurfaces, (3)r, is given by eq. (c.12) with ab = 0 and
    /2, where  is dened in eq. (c.10).
it follows, therefore, that the action for each specic bianchi type is uniquely determined
once the functional form of the threecurvature has been specied. the advantage of
employing the time variable (8.57) is that the gravitational and matter sectors of the action
(3.71) are eectively decoupled from one another. this implies that the vacuum solutions
(  = i = 0) for the dilaton and moduli elds are given linearly by

 =  +(cid:16)2e cos (cid:17) t ,
 =  +(cid:16)2e sin (cid:17) t ,

(8.58)

(8.59)

for all bianchi types, where e is an arbitrary positive constant of integration which rep-
resents the kinetic energy associated with lagrangian lm. consequently, these solutions
correspond to straight-line trajectories in the (, ) eld space. this is important because
it implies the eld trajectories illustrated in figs. (8)(10) for the isotropic frw solutions
also apply directly to the homogeneous bianchi class a cosmologies with rr elds.

in this and the following section we address what is perhaps the rst attempt to develop a
new cosmological scenario based on the underlying string symmetries that we have discussed
in this review. it was pioneered by veneziano and gasperini [388, 154] and has led to a
huge and expanding wealth of literature (for a regularly maintained update see [405]). a
radically new scenario has emerged to describe the very early universe in which we can
eectively talk about a period before the big bang. for this reason such a scenario has been
called pre-big bang cosmology [388, 154].

the eld equations derived from the string eective action admit inationary solutions
that are driven by the kinetic energy associated with the massless elds rather than any
interaction potential. a crucial test of inationary models of this sort is the spectra of
perturbations that they predict, as these can be measured today. conventional slow-roll
inationary models produce uctuations in both the gravitational wave background and the
quasi-massless inaton eld (which drives the period of ination). in general, it is dicult
to produce anything other than an almost scale-invariant spectrum of adiabatic density
perturbations since the inaton eld hardly evolves during the inationary era.
(for a
review see, e.g., refs. [248, 250]).

in contrast, there are many massless elds present in the prebig bang scenario, each
producing their own spectrum of perturbations. the dilaton, graviton and moduli elds
yield a blue spectrum that is strongly tilted towards higher frequencies [56]. on the other
hand, the axion elds that are present may have signicantly dierent spectral slopes due to
their explicit couplings to the dilaton and moduli elds [92, 97]. these can be consistent with
the current constraints derived from observations of largescale structure and microwave
background anisotropies. although this is a promising feature, a number of new problems
also appear in this scenario, most notably the graceful exit problem [64]. there are also
concerns about the specic initial conditions required for sucient ination to proceed
[384, 86, 213, 280, 65, 389, 67]. we address these problems in the remainder of this section,
after we have discussed the basics concepts behind the prebig bang cosmology.

9.1 dilatonvacuum solutions

in order to keep our discussion as straightforward as possible whilst retaining the essential
physics of the problem, we will concentrate on the fourdimensional, ns-ns string eective
action given in eq. (3.45). this includes the four-dimensional dilaton eld, , the pseudo-
scalar axion eld, , and a modulus eld, . the axion eld represents the degrees of
freedom of the antisymmetric three-form eld strength and the modulus eld represents
the scale of the internal space. we assume that the universe is adequately described by
a standard, spatially at frw metric with scale factor a(t). integrating over the spatial
variables in eq. (3.45) then yields a reduced action:

(9.3)

the eld equations derived from eq. (9.3) are symmetric under time reversal, t  t.
however, veneziano [388] also noted that the action is invariant under the discrete z2
transformation    and    when the axion eld is trivial,  = 0. together, these
discrete symmetries correspond to the transformation

a(t)  1/a(t),

(t)  (t)  6ln(a(t)),

(9.4)

and form the motivation behind the prebig bang scenario.

equation (9.4) is an example of the scale factor duality discussed earlier in the review
in section 5.1. applying the duality transformation (9.4) simultaneously with time reversal
implies that the hubble expansion parameter h  d(ln a)/dt remains invariant, h(t) 
h(t)   h(t). a decelerating, postbig
h(t), whilst its rst derivative changes sign,
bang solution  characterized by a > 0, a < 0 and h < 0  is therefore mapped onto a
prebig bang phase of inationary expansion, since a/a = h + h 2 > 0. the hubble radius
h1 decreases with increasing time and the expansion is therefore super-inationary.

thus, the pre-big bang cosmology is one that has a period of super-ination driven
simply by the kinetic energy of the dilaton and moduli elds. this is related by duality
to the usual frw postbig bang phase. the two branches are separated by a curvature
singularity, however, and it is not clear how the transition between the pre and postbig
bang phases might proceed. this is the graceful exit problem of the prebig bang scenario
[64].

to be more precise, we now consider the dilaton-moduli-vacuum solutions of section 7.1
within a prebig bang context. in these solutions, a single modulus eld  describes the
evolution of the internal space and the axion eld is held constant. the solution for a at
( = 0) frw universe is included in the general frw solutions given in eqs. (7.137.15)
and corresponds to the wellknown monotonic power-law, or rolling radii, solutions3 [298].
this class of models represents a particular case of the generalized kasner backgrounds
(6.44)(6.49) discussed in section 6. the solution is given in terms of proper time in the
string frame by

for cos  < 1/3 there is accelerated expansion, i.e., ination, in the string frame for
 < 0 and e  0 as t  , corresponding to the weak coupling regime. the expansion is
an example of polelaw ination [321]. we note that levin and freese [245, 242, 243, 244]
have also discussed inationary solutions based primarily on the kinetic energy of a massless
bransdicke type eld in a modied gravitational theory.

we see that these solutions have semi-innite proper lifetimes. those starting from a
singularity at t = 0 for t  0 are denoted as the () branch in ref. [64], while those which
approach a singularity at t = 0 for t  0 are referred to as the (+) branch. our choice
of origin for the time coordinate is arbitrary. a more fundamental denition of the (+/)
branches may be given by considering the evolution of the shifted dilaton (9.2):

(9.8)

its time derivative is always positive on the (+) branch (or t < 0) and always negative on
the () branch (or t > 0). these (+/) branches do not refer to the choice of sign for cos .
on either the (+) or () branches of the dilaton-moduli-vacuum cosmologies we have a one-
parameter family of solutions corresponding to the choice of , which determines whether
e goes to zero or innity as t  0. these solutions become singular as the conformally
invariant time parameter  r dt/a(t)  0 and there is no way of naively connecting the
two branches based simply on these solutions [64].

as we have seen a number of times in this review, it often proves useful to consider
the cosmic dynamics in the einstein frame, where the dilaton eld is minimally coupled
to gravity. the einstein frame is related to the string frame metric by the conformal
transformation given in eq. (6.50), where d = 4. under such a transformation, the scale
factor in the einstein frame, given in eq. (7.11), becomes

1/3

in terms of conformal time, , we have t   and t   as   . in the einstein
frame, as   0 on the (+) branch, the universe is collapsing with a  0, and the comoving
hubble length |d(ln a)/d|1 = 2|| decreases with time. thus, in both frames there is
ination taking place [155] in the sense that a given comoving scale, which starts arbitrarily
far within the hubble radius in either conformal frame as   , inevitably becomes
larger than the hubble radius in that frame as   0. the signicance of this is that it
means that perturbations can be produced in the dilaton, graviton and other matter elds
on scales much larger than the present hubble radius from quantum uctuations in at
spacetime at earlier times  this is a vital property of any inationary scenario.

for completeness, it is worth reminding the reader that these solutions can be extended
to include a time-dependent axion eld, (t), by exploiting the sl(2, r) s-duality invariance
of the fourdimensional, ns-ns action [93]. this was discussed in section 7.1.

9.2 initial conditions

an intriguing (and to some disturbing) consequence emerges from the above discussion.
since both h and  are positive in the prebig bang phase, the initial values for these

96

parameters must be very small. this raises a number of important issues concerning ne
tuning in the prebig bang scenario [384, 86, 213, 280, 65, 389, 67]. there needs to be enough
ination in a homogeneous patch in order to solve the horizon and atness problems which
means that the dilaton driven ination must survive for a suciently long period of time.
this is not as trivial as it may appear, however, since the period of ination is limited by
a number of factors. in this subsection, we review the criticisms that have been levelled
at the initial conditions of the prebig bang cosmology. we assume for simplicity that the
moduli elds are trivial.

the fundamental postulate of the scenario is that the initial data for ination lies well
within the perturbative regime of string theory, where the curvature and coupling are very
small [154]. ination then proceeds for suciently homogeneous initial conditions [389, 65],
where time derivatives are dominant with respect to spatial gradients, and the universe
evolves into a high curvature and stronglycoupled regime. thus, the prebig bang initial
state should correspond to a cold, empty and at vacuum state. the initial universe would
have been huge relative to the quantum scale and hence should have been well described by
classical solutions to the string eective action. this should be compared to the initial state
which describes the standard hot big bang, namely a dense, hot, and highly curved region
of spacetime. this is quite a contrast and a primary goal of prebig bang cosmology must
be to develop a mechanism for smoothly connecting these two regions, since we believe that
the standard big bang model provides a very good representation of the current evolution
of the universe.

at the present epoch, our observable universe appears very nearly homogeneous on
suciently large scales. in the standard, hot big bang model, it corresponded to a region at
the planck time that was 1030 times larger than the horizon size, lpl. this may be viewed
as an initial condition in the big bang model or as a nal condition for ination. it implies
that the comoving hubble radius, 1/(ah), must decrease during ination by a factor of at
least 1030 if the horizon problem is to be solved. for a power law expansion, this implies
that

where subscripts i and f denote values at the onset and end of ination, respectively.

in the prebig bang scenario, eq. (7.14) implies that the dilaton grows as e  ||3.
at the start of the postbig bang epoch, the string coupling, gs = e/2, should be of order
unity. thus, the bound (9.10) implies that the initial value of the string coupling is strongly
constrained, gs,i  1026. turner and weinberg interpret this constraint as a severe ne
tuning problem in the scenario, because ination in the string frame can be delayed by
the eects of spatial curvature [384].
it was shown by clancy, lidsey and tavakol that
the bounds are further tightened when spatial anisotropy is introduced [86]. indeed, the
combined eects of anisotropy and spatial curvature can prevent prebig bang ination from
occurring, in contrast to the negatively curved frw model, where the latetime attractor
corresponds to a dilatondominated expansion [86].

moreover, the dynamics of the nsns axion eld also places a lower bound on the
allowed range of values that the string coupling may take, as we saw in section 7.1 [93, 94]. a
similar eect due to rr axion elds was discussed in ref. [135]. it should be noted, however,
that this restriction may be relaxed if ination also proceeds during the string phase that

(9.10)

follows directly from the dilatondriven era once higherorder and loop corrections have
become important. this possibility was discussed by maggiore and sturani [276].

in the standard inationary scenario, where the expansion is quasiexponential, the
hubble radius is approximately constant and a  ()1. thus, the homogeneous region
grows by a factor of |i/f| as ination proceeds. during a prebig bang epoch, however,
a  ()1/1+3 and the increase in the size of a homogeneous region is reduced by a
factor of at least 10303/(1+3)  1019 relative to that of the standard ination scenario.

this implies that the initial size of the homogeneous region should exceed 1019 in string
units if prebig bang ination is to be successful in solving the problems of the big bang
model [388, 153, 213]. the occurrence of such a large number was cited by kaloper, linde
and bousso as a serious problem of the prebig bang scenario, because it implies that the
universe must already have been large and smooth by the time ination began [213].

on the other hand, gasperini has recently emphasized that the initial homogeneous
region of the prebig bang universe is not larger than the horizon even though it is large
relative to the string/planck scale [147]. indeed, during prebig bang ination, the hub-
ble radius decreases linearly with respect to cosmic time and it follows that h1
f =
3/(1+3). consequently, when eq. (9.10) is saturated one may verify that successful
|i/f|
ination is possible if the size of the homogeneous region at the onset of ination is given
by the horizon size at that time. the question that then arises when discussing the natu-
ralness, or otherwise, of the above initial conditions is what is the basic unit of length that
should be employed [147]. at present, this question has not been addressed in detail.

i /h1

one way of studying the question of naturalness is to ask whether there exists an at-
tractor whose basin of attraction (i.e. the set of initial conditions which evolve to this
state) has a large or full measure in the space of all possible initial data. in its fullness,
this is an impossible question to address because we still lack a denitive nonperturbative
formulation of string theory. furthermore, the nature of the generic attractor is not known
even at the reduced level of the eective actions because the resulting eld equations are
nonlinear partial dierential equations. the crucial point here is to establish those at-
tractors that have the largest basins and are therefore the most natural when further
restrictions are imposed.

the qualitative behaviour of prebig bang cosmology in the asymptotic past before the
onset of ination has been addressed in a series of papers [389, 65, 86, 280, 87]. veneziano
and collaborators conjectured that prebig bang ination generically evolves out of an initial
state that approaches the milne universe in the semiinnite past, t   [389, 65].
the milne universe may be mapped onto the future (or past) light cone of the origin of
minkowski spacetime and therefore corresponds to a nonstandard representation of the
string perturbative vacuum. it is at spacetime expressed in an expanding frame:

ds2 = dt2 + t2(cid:16)dx2 + e2x(dy2 + dz2)(cid:17) .

(9.11)

the proposal was that the milne background represents an early time attractor, with a
large measure in the space of initial data. if so, this would provide strong justication for
the postulate that ination begins in the weak coupling and curvature regimes and would
render the pre-big bang assumptions regarding the initial states as natural.

clancy et al. took a critical look at this conjecture and argued that the milne universe

98

is an unlikely past attractor for the prebig bang scenario [87]. they suggested that plane
wave backgrounds represent a more generic initial state for the universe [86]. in particular,
they considered the class of orthogonal bianchi b models. this has a nonzero measure
in the space of homogeneous initial data (see appendix c). the asymptotic states of the
bianchi type iii and v universes are isomorphic to the milne universe. however, these
models represent a set of measure zero and a homogeneous plane wave background is the
attractor for this class of models with a full measure of initial states [195].
indeed, we
discussed one such plane wave in section 7.4 within the context of a tilted bianchi type
v cosmology [88]. recently, kunze has applied previous asymptotic analyses [79, 80] to
investigate initial conditions of inhomogeneous g2 cosmologies [238].

buonanno, damour and veneziano have subsequently proposed that the initial state of
the prebig bang universe should correspond to an ensemble of gravitational and dilatonic
waves [67]. they refer to this as the state of asymptotic past triviality. when viewed in
the einstein frame these waves undergo collapse when certain conditions are satised. in
the string frame, these gravitationally unstable areas expand into homogeneous regions on
large scales.

to conclude this section, it is clear that the question of initial conditions in the pre
big bang scenario is currently unresolved. nevertheless, in our view, it is premature to
rule out the scenario purely on the subjective grounds of naturalness. indeed, one of the
important features of the scenario is that the pre-big bang era may have left behind unique
observational signatures that could be detectable today on large scales. as is the case for
any cosmological model, it must be the observations that decide whether it provides a viable
description for the evolution of the early universe. we defer a detailed discussion of the
observational consequences of the prebig bang model until the next section and proceed
by rst addressing a further unresolved problem for the scenario.

9.3 graceful exit in string cosmology

throughout this article we have attempted to explain how duality symmetries of string
theory can lead to a new class of cosmological scenarios. the pre-big bang solutions of
eqs. (9.59.7) provide a particularly interesting case [388, 154], where the universe starts
very near the cold, empty and at perturbative vacuum. however, we also know that
standard cosmology assumes that the early universe was in a hot, dense, and highly curved
state. thus, if we want to make phenomenological sense of the initial conditions associated
with the prebig bang, we have to explain how they would evolve naturally into those of
the standard scenario at some later time, smoothing out the big bang singularity. it is to
this key question that we now turn our attention. a number of authors have addressed the
thorny issue of the graceful exit transition from the dilaton-driven kinetic ination phase
to the subsequent standard radiation dominated evolution [61, 62, 152, 263, 329, 157, 109,
279, 68, 239, 251, 151].

in [64] it was argued, that such a transition cannot occur while the curvature was below
the string scale and the string coupling was still weak, leading to the conclusion that an
intermediate string phase of high curvature or strong coupling is required [57]. this no-
go result was later extended to a wide range of low energy actions [216, 126, 217]. the
situation is not promising when we rst look at the tree level equations of motion. the very

99

low curvature and coupling that describes the early evolution, means that the low-energy,
tree-level string eective action provides a good start for our understanding of the dynamics.
the eld equations indicate that the string perturbative vacuum, with vanishing coupling
constant gs = e/2 = 0, is unstable to small perturbations in the metric and dilaton. these
perturbations lead to an accelerated growth in the curvature and coupling [388, 154], which
are unbounded, leading to a singularity in the curvature and/or the coupling being reached
in a nite amount of cosmic time, for any realistic choice of the (local) dilaton potential.
to avoid such a singularity, we must turn our attention to the impact that higher-order
corrections can have on the eective action [64, 216, 217, 126].

in string theory, such corrections come in two avours, being controlled by two indepen-
dent expansion parameters. one is the eld-dependent (and thus in principle space-time-
dependent) coupling gs, which controls the importance of string-loop corrections. they
represent the quantum corrections associated with the classical string action. the other
parameter, , controls the importance of nite-string-size corrections, which are small if
elds vary little over a string-length distance gs = . when this second expansion pa-

rameter is small, then the higher-derivative corrections to the action can be neglected and
string theory can be described as an eective quantum eld theory.

we generally expect that both string loop corrections and  corrections will be impor-
tant as we approach the high curvature regime. this has been investigated by a number
of authors [11, 330, 329, 157], and arises because the inclusion of loops is accompanied by
the appearance of higher-derivative terms in the eective action, which in turn requires the
simultaneous inclusion of higher orders in  for consistency [11].

one possible exception arises if the initial value of the string coupling is suciently
small. it is then quite possible that the universe reaches the high-curvature regime while
the coupling is still weak. in this case, higher-derivative () corrections become important,
but the loop corrections remain negligible. we will see, however, that in general the string
corrections are a vital component of any realistic attempt to modify the high curvature
singularity.

in this section we will review a number of attempts to obtain a graceful exit in the
context of string cosmology. one of the most signicant advances was made in [151], where
the authors considered the modication of the curvature singularity due simply to stringy
 corrections, but at lowest order in gs. they showed that there existed xed point solutions
to the equations of motion, where a cosmological background evolving from the perturbative
vacuum could be attracted into a state of constant curvature and linearly evolving dilaton,
i.e., of constant h and  (in the string frame). in particular, they considered a very special
class of bianchi type i metrics given by

ds2 = dt2 +

nxi=1

e2hitdxidxi,

(t) = ct + 0

(9.12)

and parameterized by the (n + 1) constants c and hi.

in this scenario, the shifted dilaton  satises     nh < 0 in n isotropic spatial

dimensions. this is a necessary condition for the starting point of a standard cosmol-
ogy, where the background can be subsequently attracted by an appropriate potential to
a state with expanding metric (h > 0) and frozen dilaton (  = 0). of course, since the

100

dilaton keeps growing after the transition to the string phase, the eects of loops, of a
non-perturbative dilaton potential, and of the back-reaction from particle production, must
eventually become important, and as we shall see, they will play an essential role in the
second transition from the string phase to the usual hot big bang scenario.

nevertheless, in [151], the authors showed that the case of constant curvature and linear
dilaton led to a system of (n + 1) algebraic equations in (n + 1) unknowns (n hubble
constants and ). providing an example to rst order in  (i.e.
four derivatives), they
determined the xed points, and showed, by numerical integration, that any isotropic pre-
big bang background necessarily evolves smoothly towards the regular xed points, thus
avoiding the singularity. out of these solutions, one in particular is of interest, namely

the case where  6= 0. string-phase solutions with  < 0 then play the role of late-time
attractors for solutions coming from pre-big bang initial conditions. an example of this
behaviour was provided by gasperini et al. [151]. to rstorder in , the simplest eective
action in the string frame that reproduces the massless bosonic sector of the tree-level string
s-matrix can be written in the form [291]:

s =

1

16(n1)/2 z dn+1xq|g|e(cid:20)r + ()2 +

r2

(cid:21) ,

(9.13)

where k = 1, 1/2 for the bosonic and heterotic string, respectively. (we have assumed the
torsion background is trivial). a convenient eld redenition that eliminates terms with
higher than second derivatives from the eective equations is achieved by replacing the
 + r2
square of the riemann tensor with the gaussbonnet invariant r2
[404], at the price of introducing dilaton-dependent  corrections. the eld redenition

specializing to the bianchi type i background, and to the case in which the spatial
sections are the product of two isotropic, ricciat manifolds, restricts the analysis to a

(9.16)

where (i, j) = (1, . . . , n) and (a, b) = (n + 1, . . . , n + n ). the cosmological eld equations
then yield constant curvature solutions in the isotropic case n = 0 [151]. by specifying

particular, for n = 3, 6, 9, the coordinates of the xed points in the plane ( , ) are given

respectively, in units where k = 1.

signicantly, they showed by integrating numerically the eld equations for  and , and
imposing the constraint on the initial data, that for any given initial condition corresponding

to a state of pre-big bang evolution from the vacuum (i.e. 0 <  < x,  =  n  > 0), then

the solution is necessarily attracted to the expanding xed points (9.17). for the string
eective action (9.15), the xed points are continuously joined to the perturbative vacuum
(  = 0 = ) by the smooth ow of the background in cosmic time, so the action (9.15)
exhibits a smooth transition from the dilaton phase to the string phase of the pre-big bang
scenario, at least to rst order in , a result in agreement with previous assumptions [57]4.
unfortunately, in this model the dual of the expanding pre-big bang branch is not
regularized, which means that there is no smooth monotonic evolution from growing to
decreasing curvature. however, the expanding xed point determined by the  corrections
does correspond to a nal conguration of the post-big bang type, with  < 0,
 > 0, which
oers the possibility for the background to be attracted by an appropriate potential in the
expanding, frozen-dilaton state of the standard scenario. we now go on to see how this was
rst achieved in the context of adding loop corrections to the classical  correction (9.15).
the rst successful model of graceful exit transition from a dilaton-driven inationary
phase to a decelerated frw era was proposed by brustein and madden [61, 62]. it made
use of the result just derived that classical corrections can stabilize a high curvature string
phase while the evolution is still in the weakly coupled regime. the crucial new ingredient
that they added was to show that if additional terms of the type that may result from
quantum corrections to the string eective action are present and also induce violation
of the null energy condition (nec)5, then evolution towards a decelerated frw phase is
possible. of course this violation of the null energy condition can not continue indenitely,
and eventually it needs to be turned o in order to stabilise the dilaton at a xed value,
perhaps by capture in a potential minimum or by radiation production.

the analysis of [61] resulted in a set of necessary conditions on the evolution in terms
of the hubble parameters hs in the string frame and he in the einstein frame and the
dilaton  (see eq. (9.21)). they were

 initial conditions of a (+) branch and hs,  > 0 require he < 0.
 a branch change from (+) to () has to occur while he < 0.
 a successful escape and exit completion requires nec violation accompanied by a
bounce in the einstein frame after the branch change has occurred, ending up with
he > 0.

 further evolution is required to bring about a radiation dominated era in which the

dilaton eectively decouples from the matter sources.

4an intriguing physical motivation for such a solution, namely asymptotic de sitter phase with linear
dilaton, has been proposed in [137], where they point out that such a behaviour is driven in string theory
by the formation of a gravitino-dilatino condensate.

5the null energy condition is satised if  + p  0, where  and p represent the eective energy density

and pressure of the additional sources.

102

in the work of [62], the authors employed both types of string inspired corrections. the
 corrections [151] created an attractive xed point for a wide range of initial conditions
which stabilized the evolution in a high curvature regime with linearly growing dilaton. this
then caused the evolution to undergo a branch change, all of this occurring for small values
of the dilaton (weak coupling), so the quantum corrections could be ignored. however, the
linearly growing dilaton means that the quantum corrections eventually become important.
brustein and madden employed these to induce nec violation and allow the universe to
escape the xed point and complete the transition to a decelerated frw evolution.

for completeness, we introduce the notation adopted in [62]. the fourdimensional

eective action in the string frame can be written as

sef f =

1

16 z d4xq|g|e(cid:20)r + ()2 +

1

2lc(cid:21) ,

(9.18)

with the lagrangian lc containing corrections to the lowest order fourdimensional action
as specied below.
writing the metric as ds2 = dt2 + a2(t)dxidxi and  = (t), we look for solutions to

the equations of motion. it proves useful to split lc up into components:

(9.19)
the lagrangian l is taken to be of the specic form of the  classical corrections proposed
in eq. (9.15) by [151],

lc = l + lq + lm

(9.20)

the lagrangian lq represents quantum loop corrections parameterized by powers of e,
and lm represents radiation or a dilaton potential, important for the nal transition to
radiation domination and a xed dilaton.
two useful quantities are the hubble parameter in the einstein frame and its time

derivative:

(9.21)

(9.22)

if we initially set lq = lm = 0, we recover the xed point solutions, eq. (9.17). however,
as we have already noted, these do not lead to a branch change and instead, the solu-
tion represents a singular collapse in the einstein frame. this follows because the dilaton
is increasing linearly and there is insucient nec violation. moreover, the addition of
conventional sources to lm, such as radiation, does not violate nec. consequently, these
eects cannot help with the completion of the exit transition. and this suggests that sources
for lq are required.
unfortunately, the precise forms of the quantum loop corrections have not been calcu-
lated, but it is anticipated that they should be parameterized by powers of e.
in [62],
the authors introduced a series of trial terms which could eventually emerge as the actual
quantum corrections. one of these was,

1
2l

q = e()4.

103

(9.23)

at the one loop level, the overall coecient of the corrections can be absorbed by a shift of
, and it therefore determines the value of  at which the quantum corrections begin to be
important, but does not lead to qualitatively dierent behaviour.

the relative factor of e in l

q compared to eq. (9.20) leads to important consequences,
in particular l
q can lead to increasingly strong nec violation as the dilaton increases. this
produces the required bounce in the einstein frame. unfortunately, the late time solutions

hs =

 = log  t6

39366!

(9.24)

(9.25)

indicate unbounded growth in the curvature and dilaton [62]. the price that has been paid
for obtaining a bounce in the einstein frame is to introduce a new graceful exit problem. in
general, it appears that generic forms of quantum corrections can complete the exit from the
xed point of [151] to the bounce region in the einstein frame, showing that nec violation
is not only necessary, but is in some sense sucient. however, they are accompanied with
unbounded growth of the dilaton at late times, continue to be dominated by corrections
and continue to violate nec, leading to unstable () branch solutions. to overcome this
problem we need to turn o the nec violating corrections and to stop the dilaton from
growing indenitely.

a direct approach to completing the exit transition is to assume that there exists some
mechanism that shuts o the correction terms, and hence, nec violation. brustein and
madden proposed an explicit example to do this [62], by replacing the quantum correction
in the action with a non-perturbative function f ()l
q , where f () is a positive constant
for  < 0 for some constant 0 and then smoothly goes to zero. thus, f () has the form
of a smoothed step function. this successfully eliminates the loop corrections at late times
so the dilaton may be easily captured by a potential or slowed by radiation.

an alternative method of suppressing the nec violation is to add higherorder loop
corrections of the correct sign to counter the leading order corrections. for example, a two
loop contribution of the form

1
2l2

q = e2()4

(9.26)

can overwhelm the one loop nec violation when the dilaton becomes suciently large
[62]. with this form of correction the behaviour is mild enough for the dilaton to be easily
captured in a potential minimum. this can be accompanied with the onset of a decelerating
phase of expansion. similarly, these solutions are stable enough that the growing dilaton
can be halted by introducing radiation. they can then pass into a radiation dominated
phase and be smoothly joined to standard cosmologies.

although brustein and madden [62] provided the rst example of a completed graceful
exit based on classical evolution from an eective action, the models were not derived from
any particular particle physics inspired examples and a number of unresolved questions
remain. in particular, do specic string models produce coecients of the appropriate sign
and magnitude? do the actual one-loop terms that are generated violate nec? and nally,
what is the physical mechanism that shuts o these eects at the correct epoch?

104

we now turn our attention to attempts that have been made in answering these in-
teresting questions. one of the most promising directions has been proposed in [137]. in
this paper, the authors studied loop corrections derived from the heterotic string theory
compactied on a zn orbifold. they included the eects of all-order loop corrections to the
kahler potential together with corrections to the gravitational couplings, including both
threshold corrections and corrections due to the mixed kahler-gravitational anomaly. they
demonstrated that in this particular model, string loops lead to solutions that, in the string
frame, smoothly connect the pre-big bang evolution to a phase where the curvature and the
derivative of the dilaton are decreasing. in other words they achieve a successful graceful
exit.

the choice of the order  classical correction was the same as that proposed in eq. (9.15)
[151], but string loop corrections emerged out of the details of the compactication on the
z3 orbifold. the encouraging result is that the corrections include a term which has some
of the desired properties of the function f () described above, including the correct sign.
in fact, the loop corrections due to the kahler potential produce a bounce in he, moving
the solution into the required region he > 0. unfortunately, the new scaling solution still
leads to xed points  and h constant, as opposed to the required h,  decreasing with
time.

on the other hand, there is a remarkable turnaround of fortunes when moduli-dependent
threshold corrections are included in the action. these turn the de sitter phase with
linearly growing dilaton into a phase with h,  decreasing as the solution approaches the
(-) branch. this is precisely the behaviour that we require. however, without the kahler
potential corrections, there would not have been a bounce in he. this emphasizes the
importance of the corrections to the overall success of the model. one worrying aspect
also emerges, namely that the string coupling g2
s = e is of order one in these regions, i.e.
we are beginning to enter the strong coupling regime. this indicates the need to consider
genuine non-perturbative features as opposed to the perturbative corrections that have so
far been incorporated. although this is beyond the scope of this review, it should be noted
that in [137], the authors began to address this issue.
in particular, they pointed out
that at a critical coupling, the loop corrections to the kahler potential induce a ghost-like
instability, i.e., the kinetic term of the dilaton vanishes. this is similar to what happens
in the seibergwitten theory and signals the transition to a new regime, where the light
modes in the eective action are dierent and are related to the original ones by s-duality
[354, 355]. in a string context, this means that a d-brane dominated phase is entered, and
these should be taken into account [275].

we should ask why eq. (9.15) is the correct form of order  classical corrections?
indeed, it was proposed in [151] because of its invariance under eld redenitions and, as
such, is a sensible rst correction term. however, there exist other terms which could be
added at the same order and which maintain invariance under eld redenition. these are
given in [272] and [287, 218] and lead to a generalization of eqs. (9.15) and (9.20),

(9.27)

where terms up to fourth order in the derivatives are kept. recently, brustein and madden
have analysed this classical action in some depth [63]. requiring that the whole lagrangian

105

arises from a eld redenition of the low-energy eective action then implies that the three
remaining coecients satisfy [55],

c = (2a + 2d + 1)

(9.28)

we can recover the original classical correction of eq. (9.15) by setting c = d = 0.
however, it is clear that this corresponds to a particular choice of parameters and there exist
more general combinations satisfying eq. (9.28). indeed, a combination has been proposed
with the interesting property that the correction to the low energy action also possesses scale
factor duality [287, 218] . this can be achieved by setting c = 2, d +1, a =  1
2. in some
respects this form of the correction is better motivated than the truncated combination of
eq. (9.15), as it has introduced the string symmetry of scale factor duality. as we have
mentioned earlier, the precise forms of the quantum corrections have not been calculated,
but choosing particular forms that are related to the classical corrections enables the new
solutions to violate the null energy condition. this is a necessary condition for there to
be a branch change [61, 62]. we believe that the string coupling, g2
s = e, controls the
importance of the string loop corrections and therefore a reasonable rst guess seems to
be that we can model the quantum corrections by multiplying each term of the classical
correction by a suitable power of the string coupling [61, 62].

thus, we can write down an expression for the modied lagrangian including classical

and quantum corrections as

l = l(0) + l + pel + qe2l + ...

(9.29)

where l(0) is the tree-level lagrangian and l is the classical correction of eq. (9.27),
with p and q representing arbitrary coecients that multiply the quantum corrections. a
detailed analysis of the solutions to eq. (9.29) has been performed in [78]. the general
feature that emerges is that it is possible to obtain a successful graceful exit when the
quantum corrections are included, but not if it is only the classical corrections of eq. (9.27)
that are present. (this result was rst pointed out in [63]). of particular interest are the
solutions which correspond to the classical action preserving scale factor duality. however,
although the solutions are non-singular, the problem of stabilising the dilaton eld still
remains since these models have no method of providing the required potential for the eld.
mukhanov and brandenberger have proposed an alternative approach that could also
lead to non-singular dilaton cosmologies [300].
in the limited curvature hypothesis, one
explicitly constructs a model with curvature terms that remain non-singular for all time.
recently, brandenberger and easson [124] have extended earlier work [51] and applied this
idea directly to the prebig bang scenario. by introducing specic higher derivative terms
to the usual string frame dilatongraviton action, they have obtained nonsingular spatially
homogeneous solutions where all the curvature invariants are bounded [124]. in particular,
they obtain solutions to the graceful exit problem which at late time consist of an expanding
frw universe with h < 0. however, as in all other scenarios, a stabilizing potential for
the dilaton has to be introduced by hand.

easther and maeda [125] have also proposed an interesting mechanism for regulating
the singularities present in the tree level string eective action. by employing one-loop
eects, they were able to numerically demonstrate the existence of non-singular solutions

106

which smoothly connect a contracting phase to an expanding phase when spatial curvature
is present in the model.

in conclusion, the question of how the universe exits from the prebig bang phase to
the decelerating frw phase has been a major problem for the prebig bang scenario, and
it still awaits a fully satisfactory explanation. however, a great deal of progress has been
made in recent years. at the perturbative level, it has become clear that both classical 
as well as quantum loop corrections are required if a successful resolution to the problem
is to be found. in particular, quantum corrections are necessary for achieving a bounce in
the einstein curvature, he. unfortunately, the form of these corrections is not yet fully
understood, although specic models that appear to work do now exist. the major issue
of stabilizing the dilaton is still a thorny one. most scenarios lead to xed point solutions
where the dilaton grows linearly with time and rapidly enters the strong coupling regime.
this implies that non-perturbative features, such as those arising from a d-brane dominated
phase, might have to be considered [275].

10 primordial perturbations from a prebig bang era

in the previous section, we considered only homogeneous classical solutions to the lowest
order string equations of motion. we will now consider inhomogeneous perturbations that
may be generated due to vacuum uctuations. the formalism required to describe vacuum
uctuations about a homogeneous background including rst-order metric uctuations was
pioneered by mukhanov and collaborators [299, 301]. while the solutions for the homo-
geneous dilaton, axion and scale factor in the dierent frames may lead to interesting
behaviour in the early universe, the success of the standard big bang model suggests that
the evolution should closely approach the conventional general relativistic evolution at least
by the time of nucleosynthesis. if we are to see any trace of the earlier evolution it will be in
the primordial spectrum of inhomogeneities present on large-scales that we observe today.
such large-scale structure can only be generated by some unconventional physics, such as
ination [248], topological defects[392] or a pre-big bang epoch.

the production of scalar and tensor metric perturbations in the pre-big bang scenario has
been studied by various authors (see for example [56, 57, 58, 144, 273, 146, 92, 97, 206, 207,
208]). during a period of accelerated expansion the comoving hubble length, |d(ln a)/d|1,
decreases and vacuum uctuations which are assumed to start in the at-spacetime vacuum
state may be stretched up to exponentially large scales. the precise form of the spectrum
depends on the expansion of the homogeneous background and the couplings between the
elds. the comoving hubble length, |d(ln a)/d|1 = 2||, does indeed decrease in the
einstein frame during the contracting phase when  < 0. because the dilaton, moduli elds
and graviton are minimally coupled to this metric, this ensures that small-scale vacuum
uctuations will eventually be stretched beyond the comoving hubble scale during this
epoch.

as we remarked earlier, the axion eld is taken to be a constant in the classical pre-big
bang solutions. however, even when the background axion eld is set to a constant, there
will inevitably be quantum uctuations in this eld. we will show that these uctuations
can not be neglected and, moreover, that they are vital if the pre-big bang scenario is to
have any chance of generating the observed density perturbations.

107

in this section we will calculate the spectrum of semi-classical axion perturbations as well
as dilaton and moduli perturbation spectra produced in the pre-big bang scenario. then we
will extend this calculation to the more general dilatonmoduliaxion cosmologies discussed
in section 7.1, by constructing s-duality invariant combinations of the eld perturbations.
this enables us to derive s-duality invariant solutions. it will turn out that the late-time
dilaton and axion spectra are independent of the preceding evolution along dierent but
s-duality related classical solutions. signicantly, the tilt of the axion spectrum can be
appreciably dierent from the steep blue spectra of dilatons and gravitons predicted by
the pre-big bang scenario. this implies that the prebig bang scenario can indeed predict
spectra consistent with the observed scale-invariant form.

10.1 metric perturbations

in this subsection we set out our formalism for describing inhomogeneous linear perturba-
tions about the spatially homogeneous and isotropic background solutions. one can readily
extend the four-dimensional formalism of gauge-invariant metric perturbations [21, 301]
to higher-dimensional cosmologies [232, 148]. arbitrary linear perturbations about a d-
dimensional cosmological model, where the spatial hypersurfaces are maximally symmetric,
can be described by the perturbed line element

ds2 = a2()n(1 + 2a)d2 + 2(b|i  si)ddxi
+h(1  2)ij + 2e|ij + 2fi|j + hiji dxidxjo ,

(10.1)

where ij is the metric on the spatial hypersurfaces, and the subscript | denotes covariant
derivatives on these hypersurfaces.
in general we have four scalar perturbations (a, b,
, and e), two vectors (si and fi) and one tensor perturbation (hij), dened in terms of
their transformation properties on the (d  1)-dimensional spatial hypersurfaces [21, 373].
the advantage of splitting the metric perturbations into scalar and tensor parts is that the
scalar and tensor modes evolve independently to rst order with only the scalar perturba-
tions being coupled to scalar eld uctuations [21]. in addition, linear perturbations about
the homogeneous background elds can be decomposed as a sum of fourier modes with
comoving wavenumber k which evolve independently of other wavenumbers.

two of the scalar functions and one vector function can be eliminated by an appropriate
gauge transformation [21]. we will nd it convenient to work in terms of the gauge-invariant
scalar quantities [232]

where a prime denotes derivatives with respect to conformal time, . these coincide with

metric perturbations on the constant- hypersurfaces (e and ee) have been eliminated by a

gauge transformation.

6called the o-diagonal gauge in ref. [56].

108

for completeness we also give the gauge-invariant vector perturbation

esi  si + f i .

(10.4)

the perturbed einstein equations constrain the gauge-invariant vector perturbation to be
proportional to the vorticity of the velocity eld [232]. this necessarily vanishes (to rst-
order) in a scalar eld dominated universe and the vector metric perturbations are therefore
zero in a prebig bang era.

in the einstein frame, the rst-order perturbed line element can then be written as

des2 =ea2()n(1 + 2ea)d2 + 2eb,iddxi + [ij + hij] dxidxjo .

note that the scalar metric perturbations are not invariant under a conformal transforma-
tion. even the spatially at nature of the line element in eq. (10.5) is not preserved under
a conformal transformation back to the string frame due to the rst-order perturbation in
the conformal factor e = e0(1 + ). however vector and tensor perturbations do re-
main invariant under both conformal transformations and time-coordinate transformations
   + .
we can relate the scalar metric perturbations ea and eb to the more familiar ones intro-
duced by bardeen[21] in terms of the gauge-invariant metric potentials [301],

we will now consider the evolution of linear metric perturbations about the four-
dimensional dilaton-moduli-vacuum solutions given in eqs. (9.59.7). considering a single
fourier mode, with comoving wavenumber k, the perturbed einstein equations yield the
evolution equation

(10.9)

plus the constraint

ea + 2ehea + k2ea = 0 ,
ea = (eb + 2eheb) .

(10.10)

(10.11)

in the spatially at gauge we have the simplication that the evolution equation for the
scalar metric perturbation, eq. (10.10), is independent of the evolution of the dierent
massless scalar elds (dilaton, axion and moduli), although they will still be related by the
constraint eq. (10.29). the metric perturbations evolution is dependent only up on the

einstein frame scale factor, ea(), given by eq. (9.9), which in turn is determined solely

109

by the sti uid equation of state for the homogeneous elds in the einstein frame. it is
independent of the time dependence of the individual scalar elds.

eq. (10.10), using the background solution (9.9), can be integrated to give the general

solution

0 (k) + ah (2)
where h (1)
  j(z)  iy (z) are hankel functions of the rst
and second kind. using the recurrence relation between bessel functions, we obtain from
eqs. (10.11) and (10.12),

one of the most useful quantities we can calculate is the curvature perturbation on

given in terms of the gauge-invariant potential  by [301]

(10.13)

(10.14)

(10.15)

hence, with eh given by eq. (9.9) for the scale factor in the einstein frame, we obtain

in any dilatonmodulivacuum or dilatonmoduliaxion cosmology.

the signicance of  is that in an expanding universe it becomes constant on scales
much larger than the hubble scale (|k|  1) for purely adiabatic perturbations, even
through changes in the equation of state. in single-eld ination models this allows one to
compute the density perturbation at late times, during the matter or radiation dominated

eras, by equating  at re-entry (k =eaeh) with that at horizon crossing during ination. a
number of authors have calculated the spectrum of ea, and hence , in order to predict the
density perturbations induced in the pre-big bang scenario [56, 206, 208]. one can either
use the vacuum uctuations for the canonically normalised eld at early times/small scales
(as k  ) or use the amplitude of the scalar eld perturbation spectra (discussed in
the next subsection) to normalise the solution for ea given in eq. (10.12). this yields the
curvature perturbation spectrum on large scales/late times (as k  0):

p =

8
pleh 2(k)3[ln(k)]2 ,
2 l2

(10.16)

where lpl is the planck length in the einstein frame and remains xed throughout. the
scalar metric perturbations become large on superhorizon scales (|k| < 1) only near the
pl . even though bardeens gauge invariant perturbations e and e,
planck era, eh 2  l2
dened in eqs. (10.6) and (10.7), actually become large much earlier [56], the fact that the
perturbations remain small in our choice of gauge implies that our linear calculation is in
fact valid up until the planck epoch [56].

110

the spectral index of the curvature perturbation spectrum is conventionally given

as [248]

n  1 +

d lnp
d ln k

(10.17)

where n = 1 corresponds to the classic harrison-zeldovich spectrum for adiabatic density
perturbations favoured by most models of structure formation in our universe. by contrast
the prebig bang era leads to a spectrum of curvature perturbations with n = 4. such
a steeply tilted spectrum of metric perturbations implies that there would be eectively
no primordial metric perturbations on large (super-galactic) scales in our present universe
if the post-big bang era began close to the planck scale. the metric uctuations are of
order unity on the planck scale (1033cm) when t  1032k in the standard post-big bang
model. this corresponds to a comoving scale of about 0.1cm today (when t = 2.7k), about
1029 times the scale of perturbations observed on the microwave background sky. thus
the microwave background temperature anisotropies should be of order 1087 rather than
the observed 105.

fortunately, as we shall see later, the presence of the axion eld could provide an
alternative spectrum of perturbations more suitable as a source of large-scale structure.
the pre-big bang scenario is not so straightforward as in the single eld ination case,
because the full low-energy string eective action possesses many elds which can lead to
non-adiabatic perturbations. this implies that density perturbations at late times may
not be simply related to  alone, but may also be dependent upon uctuations in other
elds. as we shall see, one of these elds, the axion eld, can lead to a markedly dierent
spectrum.

the gravitational wave perturbations, hij, are both gauge and conformally invariant.
they decouple from the scalar perturbations in the einstein frame to give a simple evolution
equation for each fourier mode

hk + 2eh hk + k2hk = 0 .

(10.18)

this is exactly the same as the equation of motion for the scalar perturbation given in
eq. (10.10) and has the same growing mode in the long wavelength (|k|  0) limit given
by eq. (10.16). we will not consider here gravitational waves propagating in the n internal
dimensions [148, 167]. the spectrum depends solely on the dynamics of the scale factor in
the einstein frame given in eq. (9.9), which remains the same regardless of the time-
dependence of the dierent dilaton, moduli or axion elds.
it leads to a spectrum of
primordial gravitational waves steeply growing on short scales, with a spectral index7 nt =
3 [154, 156, 56, 57, 144], in contrast to conventional ination models which require nt <
0 [248]. the graviton spectrum appears to be a robust and distinctive prediction of any
pre-big bang type evolution based on the low-energy string eective action.

such a spectrum could be observed by the next generation of gravitational wave detectors
such as the laser interferometric gravitational wave observatory (ligo) if they are on
the right scale [4, 274]. the current frequency of these waves depends on the cosmological
model, and in general we would require either an intermediate epoch of stringy ination [62],

7conventionally a scale-invariant spectrum is denoted by nt = 0 for tensor perturbations, in contrast to

the choice n = 1 for scalar perturbations [250].

111

or a low re-heating temperature at the start of the post-big bang era [95] to place the peak
of the gravitational wave spectrum at the right scale. nonetheless, the possible production
of high amplitude gravitational waves on detector scales in the prebig bang scenario is in
marked contrast to conventional ination models in which the hubble parameter decreases
during ination. this produces a negative spectral tilt nt < 0 and the isotropy of the
cosmic microwave background on large scales then leads to an upper limit on the amplitude
of perturbations that is many orders of magnitude below the ligo sensitivity [247].

because the scalar and tensor metric perturbations obey the same evolution equation,
their amplitude is directly related. the amplitude of gravitational waves with a given
wavelength is commonly described in terms of their energy density at the present epoch.
for the simplest prebig bang models this is given in terms of the amplitude of the scalar
perturbations as

gw =

2
zeqp

(10.19)

where zeq = 24000oh2 is the red-shift of matter-radiation equality. the advanced ligo
conguration will be sensitive to gw  109 over a range of scales around 100hz. however,
the maximum amplitude of gravitational waves on these scales is constrained by limits on
the amplitude of primordial scalar metric perturbations on the same scale [95]. in particular,
if the fractional over-density when a scalar mode re-enters the horizon during the radiation
dominated era is greater than about 1/3, then that horizon volume is liable to collapse to
form a black hole.

this is important, because a scale with comoving frequency f  100hz re-enters the

hubble radius during the radiation era when the temperature is

the mass contained within the horizon at that time is

(10.20)

(10.21)

thus, gravitational radiation at ligo-observable frequencies could be associated with pri-
mordial black holes with masses of order 1014g. such black holes have a lifetime of the order
the hubble time and would be evaporating today!

there are strong observational limits on the mass-fraction of primordial black holes
with masses greater than about 1g [77, 177]. only a tiny fraction of the universe is allowed
to form black holes, and this in turn yields an upper limit on the allowed amplitude of
gravitational waves [95]:

gw =

5  106
0h2

.

(10.22)

this is slightly below the upper limit on the total density in gravitational waves coming
from models of primordial nucleosynthesis, gw < 5 105, but is well within the advanced
ligo sensitivity. if we nd pbhs and gravitational waves together then this would indeed
be an exciting result for string cosmology!

the perturbations can be re-expressed as a fourier series in terms of fourier modes with
comoving wavenumber k. we will work in terms of the scalar eld perturbations in the
spatially at gauge. these can be dened in a gauge-invariant manner as

.

(10.24)

fx = x  x 
eh
xl = fx + xe
eh

in particular, we note that the scalar eld perturbations in the longitudinal (xl) and

spatially at (fx) gauges are related by

.

(10.25)

in what follows we will always work with eld perturbations dened in the spatially at
gauge and drop the tildes.

we will rst consider the production of dilaton, moduli and axion perturbations during
a pre-big bang evolution where the background axion eld is constant,  = 0, and the
evolution of the homogeneous background elds is given in eqs. (9.59.7). the dilaton and
moduli elds both evolve as minimally coupled massless elds in the einstein frame. in
particular, the dilaton perturbations are decoupled from the axion perturbations and the
equations of motion in the spatially at gauge become

 + 2eh + k2 = 0 ,
 + 2eh + k2 = 0 ,
 + 2eh + k2 = 2 ,

note that these evolution equations for the scalar eld perturbations dened in the spatially
at gauge are automatically decoupled from the metric perturbations, although they are

still related to the scalar metric perturbation, ea, by the constraint





 +

 .

we see that, to rst-order, the metric perturbation, ea, is determined solely by the dilaton

the canonically normalised dilaton and moduli eld perturbations are [299, 56, 148, 167]

and moduli eld perturbations.

on the (+) branch, i.e., when  < 0, we can normalise modes at early times,   ,
where all the modes are far inside the hubble scale, k  ||1, and can be assumed to be
in the at-spacetime vacuum. the reader may note that in conventional ination we have
to assume that this result for a quantum eld in a classical background holds at the planck
scale. here, however, the normalisation is done in the zero-curvature limit in the innite
past. just as in conventional ination, this produces perturbations on scales far outside the
horizon, k  ||1, at late times,   0.
conversely, the solution for the () branch with  > 0 is dependent upon the initial
state of modes far outside the horizon, k  ||1, at early times where   0. the
role of a period of ination, or of the pre-big bang (+) branch, is precisely to set up this
initial state which otherwise appears as a mysterious initial condition in the conventional
(non-inationary) big bang model.

allowing only positive frequency modes in the at-spacetime vacuum state at early times

for the pre-big bang (+) branch requires [49] that, as k  ,

perturbations.

the constraint eq. (10.29), allows us to normalise the amplitude of the metric pertur-

bations ea using eqs. (9.69.7) for the background elds, and eqs. (10.37) and (10.38) for
the scalar-eld perturbations. together with setting  = ea/3 this yields the scalar curva-

ture power spectrum given in eq. (10.16) [remembering that in eq. (10.29) we are adding
independent random variables]. this spectrum of scalar metric perturbations is entirely
independent of the integration constants that parameterise the dilaton-moduli-vacuum so-
lutions given in eqs. (9.69.7). as in the case of the spectrum of tensor perturbations, this
makes it a robust prediction of any pre-big bang scenario where the universe collapses in
the einstein frame, and becomes dominated by homogeneous scalar elds.

10.3 magnetic eld perturbations in the prebig bang scenario

one of the outstanding problems in modern cosmology is the origin of the galactic and
extra-galactic magnetic elds [237]. conventional ination models where the photon eld
is minimally coupled to the scalar eld driving ination cannot leave a magnetic eld on
large scales [385, 325, 326]. however in string theory the dilaton is automatically coupled to
the electromagnetic eld strength. in the heterotic string eective action the photon eld
lagrangian is of the form (see eq. (2.12))

l = ef f  ,

(10.40)

where the eld strength is derived from the vector potential, f = [a]. note that in
an isotropic frw cosmology the magnetic eld must vanish to zeroth-order, and thus the
vector eld perturbations are gauge-invariant and we can neglect the metric back-reaction to
rst-order. if we work in the radiation gauge (a0 = 0, ai
|i = 0) then the eld perturbations
can be treated as vector perturbations on the spatial hypersurfaces. the eld perturbation
can then be written as [241]

(10.41)
where mnmnqi = k2qi. the canonically normalised eld, k, satises the wave-
equation [241, 149, 150]

ai = e/2k()qi(x)

k + k2 

(e/2)

e/2 ! k = 0 .

(10.42)

note that unlike scalar eld perturbations these perturbations are coupled only to the gauge
coupling strength e and not to the scale factor. the time dependence of the dilaton (rather
than the scale factor) leads to particle production during the prebig bang from an initial
vacuum state [241, 149, 150].

for the dilaton-modulivacuum prebig bang solutions in eqs. (9.5)(9.7) the general

solution can be given in terms of hankel functions

k = |k|1/2h+h (1)

 (|k|) + h (2)

 (|k|)i ,

(10.43)

115

where  = |1 + 3 cos |/2. taking the at spacetime vacuum state at early times (k

p =(cid:18) c()

k2(k)12 .

(10.44)

where the numerical coecient, c(), is given by eq. (10.52). this leads to an energy
density in electromagnetic perturbations, em  p, when these modes re-enter the horizon
(k = ah) during a subsequent (post-big bang) radiation dominated era, where the dilaton
is xed ( = 0). this yields the dimensionless density relative to the critical density [241]

(10.45)

where we have neglected terms of order unity which can be calculated by a careful matching
of bogoliubov coecients between solutions in succeeding cosmological epochs [241, 149,
150].

the minimum tilt possible for the prebig bang solutions given in eqs. (9.5)(9.7) is

obtained for  = 0 when  = (1 + 3)/2 and the spectral tilt nem = 4  3  2.3,

which is still strongly tilted towards smaller scales. it is impossible to obtain a less strongly
tilted spectrum for heterotic photons as that would require an even more rapid evolution
of the dilaton. however,  = 0 already corresponds to the case where the evolution of all
the moduli elds is frozen and this maximizes the rate of change of the dilaton. instead,
one would have to consider a more strongly coupled eld than the one appearing in the
lagrangian eq. (10.40).

10.4 axion perturbations in the prebig bang scenario

while the dilaton and moduli elds evolve as massless minimally coupled scalar elds in
the einstein frame, the axion elds kinetic term still has a non-minimal coupling to the
dilaton eld. this is evident in the equation of motion, eq. (10.28), for the axion eld
perturbations . the canonically normalised eld perturbation is

v 

1

16lpl

eea ,

(10.46)

and since the background axion eld is constant, the resulting density perturbations are only
second-order in the axion perturbation. this allows us to neglect the back-reaction from
the metric to linear order. the eld perturbation  is gauge invariant when  = 0 [see
eq. (10.25)] and in any gauge, the axion perturbation obeys the decoupled wave equation
given in eq. (10.28). this can be re-written in terms of v as

v +(cid:18)k2 

(ea)

ea (cid:19) v = 0 .

(10.47)

the non-minimal coupling of the axion to the dilaton leads to a signicantly dierent
evolution to that of the dilaton and moduli perturbations. substituting in the background
power-law solutions from eqs. (9.59.7), we have

v = |k|1/2hv+h (1)

 (|k|) + vh (2)

 (|k|)i ,

116

(10.48)

where we have used   |3 cos |. once again, we can normalise this by employing the at
spacetime vacuum state at early times as k   on the (+) branch, as in eq. (10.34).
we obtain

v+ = ei(2+1)/4 
2k

,

v = 0

and hence we have

approaches unity for   3/2.
the key result is that the spectral index can dier signicantly from the steep blue
spectra obtained for the dilaton and moduli elds that are minimally coupled in the einstein
frame. the spectral index for the axion perturbations is given by

n = 3  23| cos |

(10.53)

and depends crucially upon the evolution of the dilaton, parameterised by the value of

isotropic expansion, discussed in section 6.4. the lowest possible value of the spectral tilt

which if we return to the higher-dimensional underlying theory corresponds either to a xed

the integration constant . the spectrum becomes scale-invariant as 3| cos |  3/2,
dilaton eld in ten-dimensions [   + 3 from eq. (3.44)] or its t-dual solution with
n is 3  23  0.46 which is obtained when stable compactication has occurred and
the moduli eld  is xed. the more rapidly the internal dimensions evolve, the steeper
the resulting axion spectrum until for cos  = 0 we have n = 3 just like the dilaton and
moduli spectra.

when the background axion eld is constant these perturbations, unlike the dilaton
or moduli perturbations, do not aect the scalar metric perturbations. axion uctuations
correspond to isocurvature perturbations to rst-order). however, if the axion eld does
aect the energy density of the universe at later times (for instance, by acquiring a mass)
then the spectrum of density perturbations need not have a steeply tilted blue spectrum
such as that exhibited by the dilaton or moduli perturbations. rather, it could have a
nearly scale-invariant spectrum as required for large-scale structure formation. two possible
scenarios are presented in section 10.7.

8when  = 0 the dilaton remains constant and the axion perturbations evolve like those for the dilaton
and moduli elds. the late time evolution in this case is logarithmic with respect to k, as given in
eqs. (10.37) and (10.38).

10.5 sl(2,r) invariant perturbation spectra in dilatonmoduliaxion cos-

mologies

the general fourdimensional dilatonmoduliaxion solutions for the ns-ns sector of the
string eective action were presented in eqs. (7.19)(7.22). they are related to the dilaton
modulivacuum solutions presented in eqs. (7.13)(7.15) by an sl(2, r) transformation of
the form given in eqs. (7.16) and (7.17).

when we allow the background homogeneous axion elds to become time-dependent, we
must allow for the interaction between the dilaton, moduli and axion elds and the metric
to rst-order. but we have seen that in the spatially at gauge the evolution equations for
both the scalar and tensor metric perturbations [eqs. (10.10) and (10.18)] are independent
of the evolution of the dierent scalar elds and are determined solely by the evolution
of the einstein frame scale factor given in eq. (9.9) which remains invariant under the
sl(2, r) transformation. the moduli eld perturbations also remain decoupled from both
the axion and dilaton, and their evolution equation, eq. (10.27), is unaltered by the sl(2, r)
transformation. thus, the spectral tilts of the scalar and tensor metric perturbations and
the moduli spectrum, eq. (10.38), remain the same as in the pre-big bang scenario.

however, the dilaton and axion elds as well as their perturbations will in general be

aected by the s-duality transformations.

the dilaton and axion perturbation eld equations become coupled to rst order when

 6= 0, and we have

the chances of obtaining analytic solutions to eqs. (10.54)(10.56) might appear remote.
however, the presence of the sl(2, r) invariance in the underlying action allows us to nd
linear combinations of the axion and dilaton perturbations which remain straightforward
to integrate even in the more general case.

such that the perturbation equations decouple and the eld equations (10.54) and (10.55)
become

these equations decouple, even in a general dilaton-axion background, because these
variables are invariant under an sl(2, r) transformation given in eqs. (4.18) and (4.19).

this follows from writing them in terms of the symmetric sl(2, r) matrix m dened in
eq. (4.15). we have

2ehx = tr(jmjmjm) ,
2ehy = tr(jmjm) ,

these are the time-components of the sl(2, r) invariant four-vectors dened in eqs. (4.46)
and (4.47) in section 4.4 and are the unique s-duality invariant linear combinations of
the axion and dilaton perturbations. they reduce to the (decoupled) axion and dilaton
perturbations in the pure dilaton-moduli-vacuum background, as   0, where we have



x 

e = 23 cos e ,

having found s-duality invariant variables, one can verify that the evolution equations
for these variables, eqs. (10.59) and (10.60), are themselves invariant under s-duality. re-
membering that the general dilaton-moduli-axion cosmological solutions can always be re-
lated to the dilaton-moduli-vacuum solutions by an sl(2, r) transformation, we see that the
evolution equations for x and y in an arbitrary dilaton-moduli-axion cosmology are exactly
the same as those for the axion and dilaton perturbations in the dilaton-moduli-vacuum
case. just as in the constant axion case, we can dene canonically normalised variables

in the dilaton-moduli-vacuum case. in general, u obeys the s-duality invariant equation
of motion given in eq. (10.32) and whose general solution is given by eq. (10.33). the
equation of motion for v given in eq. (10.47), however, is not invariant under an s-duality
transformation. instead the s-duality invariant version of the equation of motion becomes

v + k2

! v = 0 .

(10.67)

which reduces to eq. (10.47) when  = 0. the general solution for v is therefore still given
by eq. (10.48).

we can still normalise cosmological vacuum perturbations at early times on the (+)
branch as    because we have seen that in this limit the general dilaton-moduli-axion
solution given in eqs. (7.197.22) approaches the constant axion solutions with 3 cos  =
+  0. this in turn implies that the constants u and v are given by eqs. (10.35)
and (10.49). by picking s-duality invariant eld perturbations we have been able to calculate

119

the general dilaton-moduli-axion cosmological perturbation spectra using the pure dilaton-
moduli-vacuum cosmological vacuum states. we can then write

(10.69)

we have already seen that at late times on the (+) branch, as   0, the general dilaton-
moduli-axion solutions approach dilaton-moduli-vacuum solutions with 3 cos  =   0.
it follows from eqs. (10.63) and (10.64) that as   0 the nal power spectrum for
vacuum uctuations in the general dilaton-moduli-axion cosmologies given by eqs. (10.68)
and (10.69) reduce to those given for the dilaton and axion uctuations in eqs. (10.37)
and (10.51) for the sl(2, r)-duality related dilaton-moduli-vacuum case. the tilt and

amplitude of the spectra are determined solely by the parameter  = |3 cos | and are

insensitive to the specic time dependence of the axion eld in dierent, but s-duality
related, solutions [92]. this invariance of the perturbation spectra produced along dierent
duality related solutions extends to perturbation spectra in arbitrary cosmological solutions
related by an sl(2, r) transformation, not just those derived from string theory [397].

the constraint equation for the metric perturbations ea, eq. (10.56), is only dependent on

the sl(2, r)-invariant perturbation y [dened in eq. (10.60)] and the moduli perturbations
:

 .

(10.70)

thus, the scalar metric perturbations are invariant under sl(2, r) transformations that
leave the einstein frame metric unchanged. the metric is unaected by the specic time
dependence of the axion eld and the perturbation spectrum is the same as that obtained
in the constant axion case, given in eq. (10.16).

10.6 perturbation spectra with more degrees of freedom

thus far we have only considered a single axion eld in addition to the dilaton and moduli
elds. however there are many massless degrees of freedom in the low energy string action
which will all be excited during a prebig bang era.
in this context we will refer to all
additional elds which have canonical kinetic terms in the einstein frame as moduli elds
whereas axion elds, i, retain a non-minimal coupling to the dilaton or moduli elds in
the einstein frame. the lagrange density for the axion eld has the form

1
2

eli = 

e2i(ei)2 ,

(10.71)

where i is a linear function of the dilaton and moduli elds. for the specic example of
the ns-ns axion discussed earlier we have ei = e (see eq. (3.46)).

all dilaton and moduli perturbations, minimally coupled in the einstein frame, will yield
steep blue spectra, as given in eqs. (10.37) and (10.38), in a prebig bang scenario. as a

120

consequence the spectrum of scalar metric perturbations given in eq. (10.16) is independent
of the number of additional elds. however the various (pseudo) scalar axion elds present
in low energy eective actions can have dierent perturbation spectra due to their dierent
couplings to the dilaton and moduli elds. in general, however, these numerous elds are
coupled to the same dilaton and moduli which will lead to distinctive relations between
the corresponding perturbation spectra. this non-minimal coupling for each eld can be
eliminated by a conformal transformation to a specic conformally related metric, which
we will refer to as the corresponding axion frame. in order to understand the perturbation
spectra produced in dierent elds it is revealing to look at the evolution of the conformally
related metrics, g  e2ig . quite generally we can dene the rescaled scale factor in
the axion frame [93, 92, 100]
(10.72)

the time-dependence of these axionic scale factors follows from the dilaton-moduli-vacuum
solutions given by eqs. (7.13) and (7.14) and can be written in terms of conformal time as

ai = eiea .
ai = ai||ri+(1/2) .
in terms of the proper time in the axion frame we have

ai = ai(cid:18) ti

ti(cid:19)(1+2ri)/(3+2ri)

for ri < 3/2 we have conventional power-law ination (not pole-ination) during the pre-
big bang era ( < 0) with ai  tpi
i , where pi = 1 + [2/(2ri  3)] > 1. this has important
consequences for the tilt of the power spectrum of semi-classical perturbations in the axion
eld produced on large scales.

the canonically normalised axion eld perturbations are given by [299, 92, 100]

vi

and the equation of motion can be written in terms of vi as

vi +(cid:18)k2 

ai

ai(cid:19) vi = 0 .

(10.75)

(10.76)

in the terminology of ref. [59], the pump eld s for the perturbations in each axion eld is
given by the square of the scale factor in the corresponding conformal frame, si = a2
i . for
prebig bang solutions, i.e.,  < 0, we can normalise modes on small scales at early times

by requiring that vi  eik/2k as k   [49], and this gives

for a massless scalar eld during power-law ination which approaches the famous result
pl = ( hic/2)2 as ri  3/2, and the expansion in the axion frame becomes
p/16l2
exponential9.
the amplitude of the power spectra at the end of the prebig bang phase can be written

as (see eq. (10.51))

pi|s = 64l2

s(cid:18) k

(10.80)

where ks is the comoving wavenumber of the scale just leaving the hubble radius at the end
of the prebig bang phase, kss = 1. the spectral tilts for the axion perturbation spectra
are thus given by
(10.81)

ni = 3  2i ,

which generalises the result given for the single ns-ns axion in eq. (10.53). the tilts
depend crucially upon the value of i. the spectrum becomes scale-invariant in the limit
i  3/2. the lowest possible value of the spectral index for any of the axion elds is
3 23  0.46. requiring conventional power-law ination, rather than pole ination, in
the axion frame, guarantees a negatively tilted spectrum (ni < 0)10.

the axion perturbation spectra can have dierent spectral indices, but in a given string
model there is a specic relationship between them. this follows as a direct consequence of
the symmetries of the eective action. these symmetries relate the coupling parameters be-
tween the various elds and are manifested in the spectra. such perturbation spectra could
provide distinctive signatures of the early evolution of our universe. the analysis presented
above is applicable to a wide class of non-linear sigma models coupled to gravity. in such
models, the couplings between the massless scalar elds are specied by the functional form
of the target space metric. these couplings determine the appropriate conformal factors
analogous to those in eq. (10.82) that leave the elds minimally coupled and it is the evo-
lution of these couplings that directly determines the scale dependence of the perturbation
spectra.

as an example, we consider the perturbation spectra produced within the context of a
triple axion system derived from the type iib superstring reduced to four-dimensions [100].
the dual eective action for the type iib superstring in four dimensions was presented
in eq. (3.71). in four dimensions the three-form eld strengths from the ns-ns and rr
sectors are dual to the gradients of two pseudo-scalar axion elds, 1 and 2. the third

axion eld, 3  , is the rr axion already present in the tendimensional theory. the
scalar elds parametrise an sl(3, r)/so(3) coset of a non-linear sigma model in einstein

one of the axion elds always has a red spectrum (ni < 0) while the other two spectra are

blue (ni > 0), except in the critical case | cos | = 3/2, where two of the spectra are scale-

invariant and only one is blue. this provides an example of the important phenomenological
role that the rr sector of string theory can play in cosmological scenarios [261, 262, 212,
256, 322].

the requirement that at least one axion eld has a red or scale-invariant perturbation
spectra in the sl(3, r) model could have damaging observational consequences, as we will
discuss shortly. this raises the possibility that realistic models with additional degrees
of freedom might also inevitably produce red perturbation spectra. this would then put
in doubt the ability of the prebig bang scenario to produce a suciently homogeneous
universe on large scales [100]. however, such a conclusion depends on whether the eect of
introducing more moduli elds is more or less signicant than the introduction of further
axion elds.

for example, we can extend the analysis to the sl(4, r) non-linear sigma model. this
introduces a further modulus eld and three more axion elds. a study of the perturbation
spectra produced during a prebig bang era in such a model has shown [53] that in fact the
constraint on the upper bound of the minimal spectral tilt is relaxed by increasing the size

of the group. in such an sl(4, r) model we require only that ni  3  6  0.55 for at

least one axion eld [53]. as any sl(n, r) group with n > 4 includes sl(4, r) sub-groups,
this demonstrates that increasing the group size in this way evades the requirement of a red
spectrum threatened in ref. [100].

solid line corresponds to n1, the dotted line to n2 and the dashed line to n3.

alternatively one can simply increase the number of eective moduli elds by dropping
the requirement of isotropy in the threedimensional external space [168]. this is reason-
able in the pre-big bang era as isotropy is only required by observations in the post-big
bang phase. in the simplest case of the bianchi i cosmology discussed in section 7.2, the
shear evolves like an additional massless eld and introduces a new free parameter in the
cosmological solution. the anisotropy complicates the perturbation analysis (here based
on a maximally symmetric external space) and is beyond the scope of the present review,
but it is possible to show [148, 167] that introducing shear allows all the other dilaton and
moduli background elds to remain constant in the prebig bang era. this results in a
maximally steep blue spectrum for all the axion elds.

10.7 large-scale structure from a pre-big bang era

we have seen how vacuum uctuations in massless elds present in the string eective
action predict dierent spectra of inhomogeneities on super-horizon scales at the end of a
pre-big bang era, but we have not yet discussed how these perturbations evolve through to
the present post-big bang era. indeed, in the absence of a denite model for the graceful
exit from one phase to the other, it is impossible to make denite predictions. the minimal
assumption usually made is that large-scale perturbations should be frozen-in, at least
during a suciently rapid transition. this is indeed the standard assumption made in most
models of conventional ination, where the detailed dynamics of reheating at the end of
the inationary era is usually neglected [250]. this constancy of both the scalar curvature
perturbation, , and the tensor perturbations, hij, on super-horizon scales was implicit in
our earlier discussion of both gravitational waves and primordial black holes.

isocurvature axion perturbations.
in simple toy models of the transition from pre-
to post-big bang phases, where the elds remain eectively massless, the large-scale pertur-
bation spectra do indeed seem to be frozen-in [66]. the curvature perturbations, and all
the dilaton-moduli elds which contribute to the energy density at rst order, have steep

124

blue spectra which are completely inconsistent with the observed large-scale structure in
our universe. in this case the axion eld perturbations, i, only contribute to the energy
density at second-order, but as the rst-order perturbations are so small, these second-order
eects could dominate on large scales. we can estimate the energy density associated with
the massless axion eld in the einstein frame using eq. (10.80) to give [122, 123]

where the subscript s denotes quantities to be evaluated at the end of the dilaton-moduli-
driven pre-big bang phase. note that although the amplitude of the eld perturbations
depends upon the conformal factor e2i, the eective energy density of perturbations with
k  ks is the same for all the elds calculated in the einstein frame, and depends only up
on the hubble rate ehs which is naively expected to be given by

the dierent conformal factors aect only the tilt of the spectrum and for i = 3/2 we have
a scale-invariant spectrum of density perturbations.

(10.88)

to be compatible with the observed level of anisotropies this requires either a lower than
expected normalization compared with that given in eq. (10.87), or a slightly blue-tilted
spectrum, ni = 3  2i  +0.1.
recently, melchiorri et al. [290] have determined the perturbation spectra for the mass-
less axionic seeds and extended the analysis into the acoustic-peak region by employing
a full boltzmann code. they obtain encouraging results. the evolution of the internal
dimensions (see eq. (9.7)) during the pre-big bang phase is vital in determining the overall
normalisation of the peaks as well as the value of the spectral tilt, n, given in eq. (10.53).
we do not summarize the details of their calculation here, but for completeness we include
some of their key results. ref. [290] compares the published microwave background data
with the power spectra for ve dierent tilts in the range 0.1  n  0.5. the eects of
a cosmological constant are also considered. the generic features exhibited by these power
spectra are the signicant acoustic peaks in the multipole range 250 < l < 300, with a cor-
responding blue power spectrum for the scalar component of the perturbations. however, a
nearly scale invariant spectrum arises due to the combined eects of the tensor and vector
components. the most favoured models consistent with the present data appear to be those
with 0.3  n  0.5. of most signicance is the fact that the isocurvature nature of the
perturbations results in a hump in the spectrum at l < 100. this diers from the spectra
that arise from adiabatic perturbations in standard, potentialdriven inationary models.
the location of the rst acoustic peak in these isocurvature spectra is also dierent to the
standard scenario. thus, these models are predictive and can in principle be distinguished
from the more conventional inationary scenarios.

125

it is quite clear that this type of approach should prove to be a strong test for the
models. indeed, it may be that the simplest models are already ruled out. of course, these
models have yet to fully incorporate the behaviour of the perturbations through the graceful
exit phase, and it is important to understand the impact that this epoch may have on the
perturbed elds. a rst attempt to understand this process suggests that the impact is
potentially signicant [222, 223].

primordial curvature perturbations. the result that the curvature perturbation on
uniform density hypersurfaces, , remains xed on super-horizon scales is strictly true only
for adiabatic perturbations [249]. the large number of elds present in the low energy action
can support entropic as well as adiabatic perturbations. we dene adiabatic perturbations
as those perturbations for which

these entropy perturbations can alter the value of the curvature perturbation, , even

massless axion elds only contribute to the pressure or energy density at second order
and therefore cannot lead to a rst-order change in the curvature perturbation. however
if they interact with other elds and/or acquire a mass [60] they can lead to a rst-order
eect. consider a simple toy model with a second-order phase-transition, where the density
is continuous but there is an abrupt change in the pressure on a hypersurface, , triggered
by the axion eld reaching a critical value c. the curvature perturbation, , on the
hypersurface  can be given in terms of the eld uctuations on spatially at ( = 0)

11 outlook: horavawitten cosmology

in recent years two of the most important ideas to have been developed in particle physics
and cosmology are those of superstring theory and cosmological ination. signicant ad-
vances have been made in both elds. from an astrophysical point of view, models of
ination can now be strongly constrained by a host of cosmological observations, most no-
tably those arising from microwave background anisotropies and high redshift surveys of
galaxy clusters and superclusters [248, 250, 219, 269]. in the near future, a ood of forth-
coming data will only serve to improve the current situation. in particular, gravity wave
interferometers such as ligo will constrain any primordial gravitational wave background
that may have been generated during an inationary epoch [4].

on the theoretical side, a major change of emphasis has occurred with the appearance
of elevendimensional mtheory as the (proposed) fundamental quantum theory of gravity
[400]. the moduli space of m-theory encompasses all ve, anomaly free, tendimensional su-
perstring theories. in this sense, no particular string theory is necessarily more fundamental
than any of the others. rather, they are all related by the s, t and uduality symmetries.
moreover, another region of the mtheory moduli space corresponds to elevendimensional
supergravity [400, 381], implying that mtheory is more than a theory of superstrings. this
reestablishes the importance of elevendimensional supergravity in the study of particle
physics and cosmology. in view of the excitement that has been generated by this discovery,
there is a pressing need to study the cosmology associated with m-theory and superstring
theory, especially within the context of the duality symmetries of the theories. such a pro-
gramme is still in the early stages of its development, but already progress has been made
in understanding the nature of cosmologies that may arise.

a key question to be addressed is whether a denitive inationary model can be devel-
oped from string/mtheory and ultimately constrained by astrophysical observation. the
prebig bang scenario represents the rst step towards such a goal [388, 154]. whilst there
are certainly a number of unresolved problems with this scenario, the duality symmetries
that arise within string theories can have important cosmological consequences, both at the
theoretical and observational levels. it is quite possible, therefore, that some manifestation
of string duality could be detectable within the foreseeable future.

the precise region of the mtheory moduli space that describes our presentday universe
is uncertain, but from a particle physicists point of view, the most favoured location is that
of e8  e8 heterotic string theory . horava and witten have shown that the strongly
coupled limit of this theory is mtheory on an elevendimensional orbifold r10  s1/z2
[197, 198]. the weaklycoupled heterotic string theory is then recovered in the limit where
the radius of s1 tends to zero. the orbifold s1/z2 may be viewed as a segment of the real
line that is bounded by two xed points on the circle. the eect of the z2 transformation
is to reverse the orientation of the circle, y  y, where y is the coordinate of the eleventh
dimension, and to change the sign of the threeform potential. this latter change of sign
is necessary for the elevendimensional supergravity theory to remain invariant. the two
sets of e8 gauge supermultiplets are located on each of the ten-dimensional orbifold xed
planes [197, 198]. in other words, they propagate only at the z2 xed points and restricting
the elds in this way cancels the gravitational anomalies.

in view of these developments, we conclude the review with a brief discussion on the

128

cosmological solutions admitted by the horavawitten theory. despite its potential impor-
tance, relatively little work has been done thus far in deriving and analysing tinedependent
solutions in this theory. an early study was made by benakli, who found a class of cos-
mological solutions from certain pbrane congurations [37, 38]. our aim is to present a
avour of the type of solutions that can be found and we will therefore be brief on the
technical subtleties. an excellent review of the detailed solutions can be found in [267].

witten subsequently considered a further compactication to four dimensions on a de-
formed calabi-yau manifold and showed that the resulting theory has n = 1 supersymme-
try [401]. from this a remarkable conclusion is deduced; comparison of the gravitational and
gut couplings implies that the orbifold must be larger than the radius of the calabiyau
space [401, 19]. indeed, the relative sizes may dier by more than an order of magnitude.
this immediately implies that the early universe may have undergone a phase where it was
vedimensional.

motivated by these considerations, lukas et al. derived an eective vedimensional
theory by a direct compactication of the horavawitten theory on a calabiyau space
[264, 265]. the form of the elevendimensional metric they assumed is given by

ds2

11 = v 2/3g dxdx + v 1/3mndymdyn,

(11.1)

where x (0  ,   4) and ym (5  m, n  10) are the coordinates on the vedimensional
spacetime and calabiyau space, respectively, and the metrics are denoted by g (x) and
mn(y). the deformation of the calabiyau manifold is parametrized by the scalar degree of
freedom v (x). the vedimensional metric is comprised of the fourdimensional spacetime
and the orbifold dimension.

as emphasized by lukas et al. [264, 265], a necessary condition that must be satised
for a consistent compactication of horavawitten theory to ve dimensions is that a non
zero mode of the four-form eld strength on the calabiyau threefold has to be included.
for this reason, such a compactication diers from that of the standard kaluzaklein
reduction of elevendimensional supergravity.

in what follows we adopt the normalization of reall [327]. a consistent truncation of

the eective, vedimensional theory is given by [264, 265, 327]

where  is a constant, the orbifold xed planes and vedimensional spacetime are denoted
by m (1,2)
and m5, respectively, and the pullback of the vedimensional metric onto m (1,2)
is denoted by gij (0  i, j  3). the complex scalar mode, , determines the nontrivial
components of the threeform potential on the calabiyau manifold such that amnp =
mnp/6, where mnp is the harmonic (3, 0) form. however, the consistent truncation of
the ve-dimensional action that we are considering here is only possible if the imaginary
component of  is constant. the scalar eld  is related to the deformation parameter by

where   e+i ( = constant) and y  [, ] denotes the the coordinate along the
orbifold. the z2 xed points are located at y = 0 and y = .
the constant  in eq. (11.2) arises due to the nonzero mode of the fourform eld
strength on the calabiyau space. it results in a selfinteraction potential for the scalar
eld, , that does not exhibit a global minimum. this is highly signicant, because it
implies that at space is not a solution to this theory. however, there does exist a static
solution to the eld equations that may be interpreted as a pair of parallel three-branes
[264, 265]. the existence of a threebrane solution is suggested by the potential term in the
vedimensional eective action. this may be interpreted as a 0form eld strength and,
in general, a solitonic pbrane is supported by the magnetic charge of a (d  p  2)form
eld strength in d spacetime dimensions [121].
when  is constant, the analytical form of this threebrane solution is given by [264, 327]

the threemetric, d2
3,, is the line element on the threedimensional hypersurfaces dened
in eq. (7.10) with positive ( > 0), negative ( < 0) and zero ( = 0) spatial curvature,
respectively, and {a0, b0, c0} are constants. the solution (11.6) preserves half of the d =
5 supersymmetries. after a further reduction to four dimensions, the fourdimensional
spacetime may be interpreted as the worldvolume of the threebrane [264, 265]. this
solution also applies when  has the nontrivial form [264, 266, 327]

 = ei(d0h 4 + 0),

(11.8)

130

where {, d0, 0} are real constants.
the solution (11.6) has been generalized to allow for a cosmological timedependence
[266, 327]. thus far, all solutions of this type have been found by employing the technique
of separation of variables. they have the generic form

ds2

5 = e2u (,y)d2 + e2a(,y)d2
 = (, y),

3, + e2b(,y)dy2
 = (, y),

(11.9)

where u (, y) = u1() + u2(y), etc. this separable ansatz makes it possible to search
independently for y and dependent solutions. the spatially at models ( = 0) were
in
considered in [266], and generalized to the open and closed models ( 6= 0) [327].
particular, the ydependence of the solutions found by reall [327] when  is trivial is given
by eq. (11.7) and the timedependence is

ea1 = eu1 =

 (1)/2
1 +  2

where  = 3/2,  = 1/2 and the new time variable,  , is dened in eq. (7.12) to be

(11.10)

eb1 =  
e1   ,

these solutions incorporate the  = 0 cosmological solutions rst derived in [266]. all
models evolve out of a vedimensional curvature singularity and the spatially closed models
also develop into a singularity after a nite time. on the other hand, the negativelycurved
model has interesting asymptotic behaviour in the latetime limit. the metric for the
 = 1 solution has components of the form
0| sinh |1

2 (cosh )1

e2a = e2u = a2

2 h(y)

e2b = b2

0| tanh |3h 4(y)

(11.12)

and the scalar eld is given by

e

2 = b0| tanh |3/2h 3(y).

(11.13)

it follows that at late times, ea1  e and b1 asymptotically becomes constant. this
corresponds to the static domain wall solution (11.6) and implies that this solution evolves
from an initial curvature singularity towards the supersymmetric vacuum solution of the
theory.

the time-dependence of the solutions (11.9) reduces to a particular case of the dilaton
modulivacuum solutions (7.13)(7.15) derived in section 7 [292, 93]. the reason for this
similarity is due to the fact that in both cases, the timedependence of the solutions origi-
nates from the dynamics of massless elds. this follows because the potential energy terms

in the horavawitten equations of motion arise only in the separated equations contain-
ing spatial (y) derivatives.
in eect, any dynamical eect that these terms may have is
eliminated by the static, domain wall sector of the separable solution.

in the horava-witten context, the size of the orbifold, i.e., the physical separation of
the two domain walls is parametrized by b1 and this plays the role of the dilaton eld in
fourdimensions. thus, the solution (11.10) has the same analytical form as the dilaton
modulivacuum solution (7.13)(7.15), where cos  = 1/2. these specic values on the
exponents of the solution arise because the function terms in the horava-witten equations
of motion must be timeindependent if separable solutions are to be found. this condition
implies that the orbifold dimension and calabiyau space must expand in a welldened

way (b1 = 21) and this leads to the restriction on the allowed values of . for these
by a  t(943)/33 and this solution does not represent an inationary cosmology.

values, the stringframe scale factor for the spatially at model is given [see eq. (9.6)]
it is
not presently clear whether there exist other cosmological solutions that lead to realistic
inationary behaviour within the context of the horava-witten theory. the open question
that remains, therefore, is whether this theory is compatible with the inationary scenario.
perhaps this question can be addressed by searching for nonseparable solutions to the eld
equations or by including further nontrivial formelds in the eective action.

a conformal transformations

in this appendix we will show how various geometric and physical quantities transform
under a conformal rescaling of the metric in d spacetime dimensions. quantities in the
conformal metric will be denoted by a tilde.

we shall denote the conformal factor by 2 which must be positive (to leave the signa-
ture of the metric unaltered) and is some function of the spacetime coordinates, x. the
conformally transformed metric is then

g = 2g

and the innitesimal line element is scaled:

ds2 = 2ds2.

(a.1)

(a.2)

notice that the space-/time-like or null properties of vectors remain unaltered. the deter-
minant of the metric scales as

(a.3)

pg = dg

a.1 intrinsic curvature

geometric quantities can then be dened relative to the conformally rescaled metric (a.1).
the christoel connection for instance is



 =

1
2
= 

g (g, + g,  g,)
 +

, + g

1

(cid:16)g

 ,  g g,(cid:17)

(a.4)

(a.5)

the riemann and ricci tensors can similarly be dened, yielding a ricci scalar which can
be given terms of the old metric as

2 (cid:19)
r = 2(cid:18)r  2(d  1) ln   (d  2)(d  1)g ,,

the dalembertian operator itself transforms as

  = 2(cid:18) + (d  2)g ,



,(cid:19)

(a.6)

(a.7)

and we can write the original ricci scalar in terms of the conformally transformed metric:

r = 2(cid:18) r + 2(d  1)  (ln )  (d  2)(d  1)g ,,
2 (cid:19)

(a.8)

a.2 extrinsic curvature

the extrinsic curvature tensor on a hypersurface orthogonal to a unit vector eld, na, is
given by

kab = hc

ahd

bcnd ,

150

(a.9)

where the induced metric orthogonal to na is

and upper or lower signs correspond to time-like or space-like vector elds respectively. the
extrinsic curvature tensor can be decomposed into three parts:

hab = gab  nanb

(a.10)

the expansion is given by

kab =

k
3

hab + ab + ab

k = habkab,

(a.11)

(a.12)

the shear ab is the symmetric traceless part and the vorticity ab is the anti-symmetric
part, which is necessarily zero for a hypersurface-orthogonal vector eld.

under the conformal transformation (a.1), the unit vector eld must be rescaled to give

na = 1na .

this leads to the new extrinsic curvature tensor in the conformally rescaled metric

kab = kab + habtc,c .

(a.13)

(a.14)

the shear and vorticity are simply rescaled with ab = ab and ab = ab, but the
expansion becomes

k = 1k + (d  1)1ta,a .

a.3 dilatongravity action

we now consider the dilaton-gravity action in d dimensions:

s =zm

ddxq|g|ehr  ()2i + 2zm

dd1xq|h|ek

where r is the intrinsic curvature of the metric gab on the manifold m and k is the
extrinsic curvature of the boundary hypersurface m orthogonal to the vector eld na,
with the induced metric hab. [see eq.(a.10)]11

under the conformal transformation (a.1) the action becomes

(a.15)

(a.16)

(a.17)

s =zm
+2zm

ddxdq|g|eh2 r + 2(d  1)2  (ln )
(d  2)(d  1)( )2  2( )2i
dd1x1dq|h|ehk  (d  1)( )a nai ,

11the boundary term is necessary if the eld equations are to be derived from requiring that the action
is extremised with respect to any eld variations that vanish on the boundary. otherwise one requires in
addition that the rst derivatives of the variations also vanish on the boundary [403, 161, 396].

151

where the ricci scalar is given by (a.8) and the extrinsic curvature by (a.15). this reduces
to

s =zm

ddxq|g|e2dh r  ( )2 + (d  2)(d  1)2( )2
+2(d  1)1( )( )i + 2zm
dd1xq|h|e2d k .

(a.18)

there are two important cases:
1.  = ef (), where f () 6= /(2  d)

in this case the form of the action given in eq. (a.16) remains conformally invariant
if we dene

and

 =

 =  + (d  2)f ()

  (d  1)f() [2 + (d  2)f()]

[1 + (d  2)f()]2

(a.19)

(a.20)

.

in the particular case f () = 2/(d  2), the dimensionless brans-dicke parame-
ter  remains invariant, but we have  = . this invariance of the gravitational
lagrangian plays a key role in string-string duality discussed in section 5.

2. 2d = e

in this case we have

s =zm

ddxq|g|(cid:20) r (cid:18) +

d  1

d  2(cid:19) ( )2(cid:21) + 2zm

dd1xq|h| k .

(a.21)

this is usually referred to as the einstein frame, as the gravitational action has the
standard einstein-hilbert form, and the dilaton is minimally coupled to the metric in
this frame.

a.4 energymomentum tensor

we now consider the part of the action contributed by the integral of the matter lagrangian:

smatter =zm

gddxlmatter

the energy-momentum tensor is dened as

(a.22)

(a.23)

(a.24)

(a.25)

so that a rst-order variation of the matter action with respect to the metric is given by

t  =

2



g (cid:0)glmatter(cid:1)
g
16zm
gddx [8t  ]

smatter

g

=

1

in terms of the conformally transformed metric

smatter =zmpgddxdlmatter

152

so the corresponding energy-momentum tensor must be

t  =

2



g (cid:16)pgdlmatter(cid:17)
g
= d 2
g
= d2t 

g(cid:0)glmatter(cid:1)

g
g



(a.26)

therefore one can, mathematically speaking, describe the energy-momentum tensor t  as
conformally invariant with weight (d+2). (its trace t has weight d.) however the com-
mon statement that only traceless (t = 0) matter (i.e. radiation) is conformally invariant
follows from the further, physical, requirement that if the original energy-momentum ten-
sor is conserved (t = 0) then the conformally transformed energy-momentum tensor
is also conserved. in general we nd

 t = 

,


t .

(a.27)

if the matter in the original metric evolves as a perfect uid its energy-momentum tensor
can be given in terms of its density , pressure p and (time-like) velocity eld u, normalised
such that uu = 1:

t  = ( + p)uu + pg

(a.28)

under a conformal transform the unit time-like velocity eld transforms as u = 1u
and the energy-momentum tensor can be rewritten as

where

t  = ( + p)u u + pg

 = d
p = dp

(a.29)

(a.30)

(a.31)

notice that a barotropic uid, p = (  1), retains the same barotropic index under the
conformal transformation. however it will not remain a perfect uid conserving energy and
momentum unless t = {(d  1)  d} = 0.

a.5 form fields

a specic type of massless eld that arises many times in this review is the antisymmetric
(n  1)form potential. this has a eld strength dened by ha1a2...  n[a1ba2...]. since
this denition is independent of the metric, it is conformally invariant. however, the scalar
quantity

transforms as

h 2  ga1b1ga2b2 . . . ha1a2...hb1b2...

h 2 = 2nh 2 .

b modular group of the torus

in this appendix, we discuss the relationship between a 2torus and the group sl(2, z)
[7, 183, 169, 368, 353, 268]. let the coordinates spanning the 2plane 2 be represented
by 1 and 2. a twodimensional torus t 2 can then be constructed by imposing a suitable
equivalence relation in the 2plane [183]:

(1, 2)  (1 + p, 2 + q)

(b.1)

where p and q are arbitrary integers. hence, a 2torus may be viewed as 2/, where  is
a twodimensional lattice.
there exists a group of transformations where points that are equivalent under the
identication (b.1) are mapped onto equivalent points. these transformations correspond
to the dieomorphisms

(b.2)
where {a, b, c, d} are integers. eq. (b.2) represents an invertible and onetoone map of
the 2torus onto itself if these constants also satisfy the additional constraint ad  bc = 1.
eq. (b.2) gives the action of the matrices

(1, 2)  (d1 + c2, b1 + a2)

u =  d c
b a ! ,

ad  bc = 1,

{a, b, c, d,}  z

(b.3)

by fractional linear transformations. these matrices form a group sl(2, z) corresponding
to a subgroup of sl(2, r). as we discussed in section 4.2, the action of sl(2, z) on the
complex plane is determined by   (a + b)/(c + d) and the group is generated by the
transformations

  1/
re   re  + 1

(b.4)

(b.5)

if we consider transformations away from the imaginary axis, re  6= 0, eq. (b.4) inter-
changes the interior region of the unit circle with the exterior region [368] and is equivalent
to the simultaneous interchange 1  2 and 2  1 [183]. the transformation (b.5)
leaves 1 invariant and induces the shift 2  2 + 1.
a 2-torus has complex dimension of one and may also be parametrized in terms of a
complex variable z dened by [183]

z  1 + 2

(b.6)

where  is an arbitrary complex number with positive denite imaginary part. then, from
eq. (b.1), a 2torus may be described (up to a conformal equivalence) in terms of the
complex plane, where the identications z  z + 1 and z  z +  are made [347, 353]. in
other words, a 2torus is constructed by identifying the opposite ends of the parallelogram,
where one length of the parallelogram is identied with the point 1 and the other with
the complex parameter  [387]. it then follows that  and  = (a + b)/(c + d) describe
equivalent tori.

154

to summarize, the group sl(2, z) may be realised as the group of reparametrizations of
the 2torus, corresponding to a change in basis vectors of the lattice in 2. for these reasons
it is referred to as the modular group of the torus and the parameter  then represents the
modular parameter. this provides a geometrical interpretation of the sduality of the type
iib superstring discussed in section 5.3.

we also remark that the appearance of the sl(d, r)/so(d) nonlinear sigmamodel is
a generic feature of (super)gravity theories compactied on t d. the group sl(d, r) is the
remnant of the higherdimensional dieomorphism (lorentz) invariance that is unbroken by
the toroidal compactication for example, the toroidal compactication of einstein gravity
leads to the action (3.10). since fab is an arbitrary, symmetric, d  d matrix with unit
determinant, the moduli elds arising from the higherdimensional metric parametrize the
sl(d, r)/so(d) coset. with this connection in mind, the sduality of the tendimensional
type iib superstring has been cited as evidence for the existence of a twelvedimensional
theory that is referred to as ftheory [386].

c bianchi classication of homogeneous spacetimes

the bianchi models are fourdimensional spacetimes that admit threedimensional, space-
like hypersurfaces, t, on which a threeparameter group of isometries acts simply transi-
tively [336, 395, 271]. the group of isometries is a lie group, g3. by simply transitive, we
mean that for all points p and q on t there exists a unique element of the lie group that
maps p onto q. this implies there is a onetoone correspondence between the points on
t and the elements of g3 and the structure of the spacetime is therefore m4 = r  g3.
coordinates can then be chosen such that the fourdimensional line element is given by

ds2 = dt2 + hab(t)ab,

a, b = 1, 2, 3

(c.1)

the surfaces of homogeneity, t, then represent surfaces of constant proper time, t. the
oneforms a determine the isometry of the threesurfaces and satisfy the maurercartan
equation

da =

c a

bcb  c

(c.2)

2

where c a

bc are the structure constants of the lie algebra of g3. these are antisymmetric,

and satisfy the jacobi identity

c a

(bc) = 0

c e

d[ac d

bc] = 0

(c.3)

(c.4)

bianchi was the rst to determine and classify all threedimensional lie algebras into
nine types, i, ii, . . ., ix [44]. here we consider the classication due to ellis and maccallum
[131]. the antisymmetric condition (c.3) implies that c a
bc has at most nine independent
components. these can be separated into the six components of a symmetric 3  3 matrix
m ab and the three components of a 3  1 vector ab. dening the latter as the trace:

implies that the former may be dened by

c c

ab  m cddab + c

[aab]

(c.6)

where abc is the totally antisymmetric tensor and 123 = 1. substitution of eq. (c.6) into
eq. (c.4) implies that ab is transverse to m ab [131]:

m abab = 0

(c.7)

bc can be independent.

thus, only six components of c a
if ab is nontrivial, it may be
viewed as an eigenvector of m ab with a zero eigenvalue. without loss of generality, m ab
may be diagonalized, m ab = diag[m1, m2, m3], and ab may be written as ab = (a, 0, 0).
by a suitable rescaling, the eigenvalues of mab can then be made equal to 0, 1 and this
implies that eq. (c.7) simplies to
(c.8)
models where a = 0 are referred to as the bianchi class a [131]. models where a 6= 0
(m1 = 0) belong to the bianchi class b. in the former case, the lie algebras are classied
by the rank (the number of nonzero elements) of m ab and the modulus of its signature.
thus, there are six types in this class. the dierent bianchi types are labelled in table 4
[271, 370].

m1a = 0

in the class b there are four possibilities for the rank of m ab and the modulus of its

signature, since m1 = 0. when rank[m ab] = 2, one may dene a scalar, h:

a2

m2m3

h 

(c.9)

thus, there are two oneparameter families of lie algebras in the class b. these are labelled
by the parameter h and h < 0 for the type vih and h > 0 for the type viih. we remark
that the bianchi type iii is the same as the type vi1.

table 5: the standard form of the oneforms a for the bianchi types that arise in the
spacetime metric (c.1).

in some cases the g3 group of isometries may only represent a subgroup of the full
symmetry. there may also exist a group of transformations such that all points p on t
are mapped onto themselves. this group of transformations is called the isometry group.
spacetimes admitting an isometry group are called locally rotationally symmetric (lrs)
spacetimes [130]. lrs spacetimes arise for bianchi types i, ii, vii0, viii, ix, iii and viih
[131]. the frw metrics admit a threedimensional isotropy group. they are the isotropic
limits of the type ix (k = 1), types i and vii0 (k = 0), and types v and viih (k = 1).
all bianchi types.
parametrized by

the oneforms that arise in the spacetime metric (c.1) are tabulated in table 5 for
[271]). the threemetric may be

(for further details see, e.g., ref.

(c.10)

hab(t) = e2(t)(cid:16)e2(t)(cid:17)ab

3,2+i

where

ab  diagh+ + 3, + 

(c.11)
is a traceless matrix. thus, [dethab]1/2  h1/2 = e3 and the volume parameter and shear
are entirely determined by  and , respectively.
the scalar curvature, (3)r, of the homogeneous hypersurfaces, t, is uniquely determined
bc of the corresponding lie algebra for each bianchi type

by the structure constants c a
[394, 395]. it is given by

(3)r =

(c.12)

where indices are raised and lowered with hab and hab, respectively. thus, the bianchi type
i is spatially at. in this sense, it represents the simplest anisotropic cosmology and the
g3 is the abelian translation group t 3. for closed spatial sections, t has the topology of
a 3torus, t 3 = s1  s1  s1. it follows from table 4 that all bianchi models, except type
ix, have nonpositive spatial curvature, (3)r  0 [394]. for type ix, g3 = so(3) and the
topology of t is s3.
in the class b models (a 6= 0), a divergence term may arise when integrating over
the spatial variables in the eective action due to the term proportional to abab in eq.

157

(c.12). this renders the lagrangian and hamiltonian formulations of the eld equations
ambiguous for these models [372]. for the class a, on the other hand, the reduced action for
the fourdimensional dilatongraviton sector of the string eective action (3.18) is derived
by substituting in the ansatz (c.1) and integrating over the spatial variables. this leads to

s =z dte3h6    6 2 + 6 2

+ + 6 2

  2 + (3)ri

(c.13)

finally, we note that when the dilaton eld is constant on the surfaces of homogeneity,
 = (t), the einstein and string frame metrics correspond to the same bianchi metric.
in other words, the conformal transformation (a.21) relating the two metrics does not
alter the oneforms a. indeed, when the threemetric is given by (c.10), the conformal
transformation is formally equivalent to a rescaling of the time parameter and volume of
the spatial sections.
