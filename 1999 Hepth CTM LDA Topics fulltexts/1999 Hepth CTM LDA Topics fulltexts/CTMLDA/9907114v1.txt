abstract

it was shown by connes, douglas and schwarz that gauge theory on non-
commutative torus describes compactications of m-theory to tori with constant
background three-form eld. this indicates that noncommutative gauge theo-
ries on more general manifolds also can be useful in string theory. we discuss a
framework to noncommutative quantum gauge theory on poisson manifolds by
using the deformation quantization. the kontsevich formula for the star prod-
uct was given originally in terms of the perturbation expansion and it leads to a
non-renormalizable quantum eld theory. we discuss the nonperturbative path
integral formulation of cattaneo and felder as a possible approach to construc-
tion of noncommutative quantum gauge theory on poisson manifolds. some other
aspects of classical and quantum noncommutative eld theory are also discussed.

1 introduction

in a remarkable paper connes, douglas and schwarz [1] have shown that super-
symmetric gauge theory on noncommutative torus is naturally related to compact-
ication of matrix theory [2]. this shows that the framework of noncommutative
geometry [3, 4] can be useful in string theory. for some reviews and further devel-
opments see [5]-[26]. one of the natural questions is whether noncommutative gauge
theory can be used to describe more general compactications in string theory. in or-
der to have progress in this direction one has to develop the theory of noncommutative
quantum gauge elds not only on the torus but also on more general manifolds. in this
note we discuss a framework to noncommutative gauge theory on poisson manifolds
by using the recently developed deformation quantization. in particular the question
of renormalizability of noncommutative quantum theory is discussed.

gauge theory on noncommutative torus is equivalent to noncommutative gauge the-
ory on the commutative (i.e. ordinary) torus. motivated by investigations of quantum
group symmetries in two dimensional integrable models [27] a proposal of consider-
ation of noncommutative gauge symmetry on ordinary manifolds (quantum group
gauge theory) has been suggested in [28], see also [29, 30] for further discussions.
such a theory could be used as an alternative to the conventional higgs mechanism of
symmetry breaking. it was also shown [33] that a noncommutative gauge theory (quan-
tum boltzmann theory) describes the large n limit in qcd. various other approaches
to eld theory on noncommutative spaces have been discussed in [31, 32].

a connection of noncommutative geometry with non-archimedian geometry at the
planck scale and p-adic mathematical physics [34] has been considered in [35]. a
proposal to replace the picture of spacetime as a manifold to the theory of motives
with motivic galois group as gauge group has been made in [36] as a natural extension
of p-adic string theory and p-adic gravity [37, 38]. in particular l-function of delignes
motive has been interpreted as the partition function of string theory. applications of
motives to quantum eld theory also have been discussed recently in [39]. a general
discussion of relations between number theory and physics is given in [40].

noncommutative gauge theory uses the deformed product (the star product)
instead of the ordinary product. the star product [41] is a generalization of the moyal
product well known in quantum mechanics [10]. the construction of star product
for symplectic manifolds was given by de wilde and lecomte [43] and fedosov [44].
kontsevich [45] has found an explicit formula for the star product on poisson manifolds
(nondegenerate poisson structure is reduced to the symplectic structure). his formula
is a corollary of a more general result about the existence of a quasi-isomorphism
between the hochschild complex of the algebra of polynomials and the graded lie
algebra of polyvector elds [45]. quantum deformations of the poisson-lie structures
have been considered in [46, 47].

the formula for the star product was given in [45] in terms of a perturbation series
and if one attempts to use it in noncommutative quantum eld theory then one gets

2

a non-renormalizable quantum theory. however it was pointed out in [45] that the
formula can be viewed as a perturbation series for a topological quantum eld theory
coupled with gravity. recently cattaneo and felder [51] have shown that kontsevichs
star product formula is equivalent to the perturbative expansion of the path integral
of a two-dimensional topological quantum eld theory.

in this note we discuss the application of the cattaneo and felder formulation to

noncommutative gauge theory on poisson manifolds.

there is also a dierent aspect of the cattaneo and felder formulation. the moyal
bracket gives us a natural way to introduce a form-factor to quantum eld theories.
the nonlocality of the moyal bracket is related with random particle (one-dimensional
world-sheet) and it is not enough to make a theory nite. the cattaneo and felder for-
mula uses a random surface and its generalization to random surfaces with non-trivial
dynamics in principle could lead to a nite quantum theory. string theory interpre-
tation of the star product has been given by schomerus [23]. it would be interesting
to explore a connection between the star product in deformation quantization and
wittens product in string eld theory [48] generalized on curved manifolds.

the paper is organized as follows. in the next section we will recall some notions
of noncommutative geometry, then discuss the moyal product and its applications in
quantum eld theory. in section 5 the deformation quantization is described and nally
in section 6 eld theory on poisson manifolds is discussed.

2 noncommutative geometry and gauge fields

noncommutative geometry appears in physics in works of the founders of quantum
mechanics. heisenberg and dirac have proposed that the phase space of quantum
mechanics must be noncommutative and it should be described by quantum algebra.
after works of von neumann and more recently by connes mathematical and physical
investigations in noncommutative geometry became very intensive.

noncommutative geometry uses a generalization of the known duality between a
space and its algebra of functions, see [3, 4, 1]. if one knows the associative commutative
algebra a(m) of complex-valued functions on topological space m then one can restore
the space m. therefore all topological notions can be expressed in terms of algebraic
properties of a(m).for example, the space of continuous sections of vector bundle
over m can be regarded as a projective a(m)-module. (we are speaking about left
modules. a projective module is a module that can be embedded into a free module
as a direct summand). so vector bundle over compact space m can be identied with
projective modules over a(m).

now let us make the following generalization. let a be an abstract noncommu-
tative algebra which we will interpret as an algebra of functions on (nonexistence)
noncommutative space. one can introduce many geometrical notions in this setting.
for example, a vector bundle is by denition a projective module over a(m) and one

3

can develop a theory of such bundles generalized the standard theory. in particular
one can dene a connection by using the following way. let g be a lie algebra of
derivations of a and 1, ...d be generators of g.
if v is a projective module over
a (i.e. a vector bundle over a) one denes a connection in v as the set of linear
operators 1, ...d on v satisfying

i(a) = ai() + i(a)

(1)

where a  a,   v,

i = 1, ...d.

in the case when a is an algebra of smooth functions on rd or on the torus t d
we get the standard notion of connection in a vector bundle. in this case the abelian
algebra g = rd acts on rd or t d and correspondingly on a by means of translations.
the curvature of connection i

fij = ij  ji  f k

ijk

(2)

belongs to the algebra of endomorphisms of the a-module v .

the d-dimensional noncommutative torus is dened by its algebra a with gener-

ators u1, ...ud satisfying the relations

uiuj = e2ij ujui

(3)

where i, j = 1, ...d and  = (ij) ia a real antisymmetric matrix. the algebra a is
equipped with an antilinear involution  obeying u 
(i.e. a is a *-algebra).
an element of a is a power series

i = u 1

i

f = x f (p1, ...pd)u p1

1 ...u pd

d

(4)

where p = (p1, ...pd)  z d and the sequence of complex coecients f (p1, ...pd) decreases
faster than any power of |p| = |p1| + ... + |pd| when |p|  . the function f (p) is
called the symbol of element f . we denote u p the product u p1
d . then one has

1 ...u pd

u pu k = e2i(p,k)u p+k, where (p, k) = p ijpipj and ij is a matrix obtained from

 after deleting all its elements below the diagonal. to simplify the product rule we
replace u p by ei(p,q)u p so that we have

if f and g are two elements of a,

u pu k = e2i(p,k)u p+k

then the product

f (p)u p,

f = xp

g(k)u k

g = xk

f (p)g(k)u pu k =

f g = xp,k

(7)

xp,k

f (p)g(k)e2i(p,k)u p+k = xp

(f  g)(q)u q

where the star-product (f  g)(q) of symbols f (p) and g(k) is

(f  g)(q) = xp

f (p)g(q  p)ei(p,qp)

(8)

the dierential calculus on the noncommutative torus is introduced by means of

the derivations j dened as

ju p = ipju p,

j = 1, ...d

(9)

they satisfy the leibniz rule j(f g) = jf  g + f  jg for any f, g  a.

the integral of f = p f (p)u p is dened as r f = f (0), which is in correspondence

with the commutative case. the integral has the property of being the trace on the

algebra a, i.e. r f g = r gf for any f, g  a. moreover one has

z jf  g = z jg  f

the gauge eld ai on the noncommutative torus is dened as

ai = xpz d

ai(p)u p,

i = 1, ...d

(10)

(11)

here ai(p) is a sequence of n  n complex matrices indexed by a spacetime index. it
corresponds to the fourier representation of the ordinary gauge theory on commutative
torus. the gauge eld is antihermitian, a
i = ai, or ai(p) = ai(p). ai is an
element of a matrix algebra with coecients in a and its curvature is dened as

fij = iaj  jai + [ai, aj]

where i is a derivative on a dened above. the yang-mills action is

s = 

1

4 z tr(fijf ij)

the action is invariant under gauge transformations

ai  ai1 + i1, fij  fij1

where  is a unitary element of the algebra of matrices over a.

3 moyal product

let us consider one-dimensional quantum mechanics in the hilbert space of square
integrable functions on the real line l2(r) with ordinary canonical operators of position
q and momenta p,

acting as q(x) = x(x), p(x) = id(x)/dx.
f (q, p) is given in terms of its fourier transform

if a function of two real variables

[p, q] = ih,

(15)

then one can associate with it an operator f in l2(r) by the following formula

f (q, p) = z ei(rq+sp) f (r, s)drds,

f = z ei(r q+sp) f (r, s)drds.
symbol of the operator f [42]. one has the correspondence

this procedure is called the weyl quantization and the function f (q, p) is called the

(16)

(17)

if f  is the hermitian adjoint to f then its symbol is f  = f (q, p)

f  f = f (q, p)

(18)

(19)
if two operators f1 and f2 are given with symbols f1(q, p) and f2(q, p) then the

f   f (q, p) = f(q, p)

symbol of product f1 f2 is given by the star-product f1  f2 = (f1  f2)(p, q) as [42]

(f1  f2)(p, q) = x,

(21)
introducing the constant poisson structure on the plain  = , 12 = 1 and
notations x = (q, p), x = (qi, pi), i = 1, 2 , x1x2 = q1p2  q2p1 one write

(f1  f2)(x) =

one also has

2i(xx1 + x1x2 + x2x) = 2iz

pdq

(23)

where  is the triangle on the plane with vertices x = (p, q), x1 = (p1, q1) and x2 =
(p2, q2) and there is the path integral representation

e2ir pdq = z e2ir pdqy dx( )

one integrate over trajectories x = x( ), 0    1 in the phase plane with the
boundary conditions

x(0) = x(1) = x, x(1/3) = x1, x(2/3) = x2

therefore we obtain that the moyal bracket is represented in the form

(f  g)(x) = z k(x, x1, x2)f (x1)g(x2)dx1dx2

where the kernel k(x, x1, x2) has a path integral representation

where

h sy dx( )

k(x, x1, x2) = z e i
s = 2iz pdq

(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

and the path integral is taken over the trajectories x = x( ), 0    1 subject to the
conditions (25).

4 example: scalar interaction

to study divergences it is instructive to consider an example of quartic interaction of
a scalar complex eld. we have

l = z ddx[

({ , }m.b.)2]

(29)

{ , }m.b. =       

d = 2n. note that the interaction in (29) can be also represented in terms of interacting
of the moyal bracket with an auxiliary eld 

lint = g{ , }

(30)

we use a relation of the star-product with the weyl symbol of the product of operators

(f  g)(x) = z k(x, x1, x2)f (x1)g(x2)dx1dx2

(31)

7

where the kernel k(x, x1, x2)has a path integral representation

k(x, x1, x2) = z e i

x(0)=x(1)=x, x(1/3)=x1, x(2/3)=x2

h s(x( ))

y
s(x( )) = z (x1idx2i  x2idx1i)

dx( )

(32)

(33)

the integration in (27) is over loops with three xed points x(0) = x(1) = x, x(1/3) =
x1, x(2/3) = x2. the choise of points 1/3 and 2/3 on the loop is arbitrary and due to
reparametrization invariance the result does not depend on this choise.

and

k(x1, x1, x2) = d(x, x1)d(x1, x2)d(x2, x)

d(x, y) = (

we interpret (28) as a propagator of an auxiliary eld and represent (26) on dia-

grams as shown on fig.1.

let us note that due to an estimation of the form-factor entering in the vertex (38)

|v(p, q, r)| < 1

(43)

it is evident that the index of absolute divergence of a diagram with extra form-factor
is the same as the index of the corresponding diagram with local interaction. however
this estimation is not enough to guarantee the renormalizability of the theory by the
following raisons. the above estimation do not care of the subdivergences. to have
the renormalizability we have to guarantee that all divergencies combine to a special
structure to reproduce nonlocal structure of interaction. the last problem one meets
already at the 1-loop level. as was shown recently in [52, 53, 54] for abelian non-
commutative yang-mills theory 1-loop divergencies combine to renormalizations of the
wave function and coupling constant and moreover the corresponding theory in d=4
is asympotically free.
in the next section we will describe a diagram technique for
perturbation expansion of sypersymmetric yang-mills theory on noncommutative t 4.
in the case of extended supersymmetries it is enough to study only 1-loop diagrams to
guarantee the renormalizability.

5 noncommutative sym

according to [1], the noncommutative u(1) gauge connection can be built by

i = i + i{ai,

}m.b.

(44)

with

{f, g}m.b.(x) = (f  g)(x)  (g  f )(x) = 2if (x) sin (iij



i



j)g(y)|y=x.

(45)

the curvature is

fij = [i, j] = [iaj] + i{ai, aj}m.b.

i = 0, 1, ...9

(46)

10

then u(1) ncym (on t 2

 ) is given by

s =

1
g2

y m z d2x fijf ij.

the above action has the gauge invariance:

ai  ai + i + i{, ai}m.b.

(47)

(48)

we can also supersymmetrize this action by adding the correct fermionic and scalar
degrees of freedom [5,16]. one can take d = 10, n = 1 non-abelian yang-mills theory
with the group commutators substituted for the moyal bracket and make dimensional
reduction to d-dimensional case

(51)

where c and c are faddeev-popov ghosts, sgf [a] =  1

popov term is r  c(c + g[a, c])

the generating functional can be computed perturbatively using feynman diagrams
[52]-[54] the quadratic terms are identical to the ones appearing in non abelian gauge
theories and one gets the following propagators:

although the propagators are the same as in standard non-abelian yang-mills the-
ory, the interactions take a dierent form. to the three gauge bosons interaction we
have

2g{(p  r)g + (q  p)g + (r  q)g} sin (p, q)(p + q + r)

(52)

11

for the four gauge bosons interaction we have the sum of the following terms

 4g2(cid:16) (gg  gg) sin (p, q) sin (r, s)

+ (gg  gg) sin (p, r) sin (s, q)

+ (gg  gg) sin (p, s) sin (q, r) (cid:17)(p + q + r + s).

for the interaction of a gauge boson with ghosts we have

(53)

2gr sin (p, q)(p + q + r).

the interaction of scalar elds and gauge elds can been obtained by dimensional
reduction of the previous vertices. namely, we can substitute instead of , , ,  in
(52) and (53) m, n, r, s and make a reduction

m  (, a), n  (, b)

r  (, c),

s  (, d)

and now all momenta are d-dimensional. the interaction of scalar elds and gauge
elds contains two vertices: 3-vertex describing interaction of gauge elds with scalars

two scalars - two gauge eld vertex

2[q  p]gbc sin (r, p)(p + q + r),

and 4-vertex describing interaction of scalars

4g2ggba(sin (p, r) sin (s, q)  sin (p, s) sin (q, r)(cid:17)(p + q + r + s)
 4g2(cid:16) (gagbd  gadgb) sin (p, q) sin (r, s)

+ (gadgbc  gabgcd) sin (p, r) sin (s, q)

+ (gabgcd  gacgbd) sin (p, s) sin (q, r) (cid:17)(p + q + r + s).

(54)

fermions interact with gauge elds as well as with scalar elds. the interaction of

a gauge boson with fermions is associated with

2gr sin (p, q)(p + q + r).

all these interactions are non local since they involve non polynomial functions of

the momenta.

it follows from the inequality | sin (p, q)|  1 that any diagram which is convergent
by powercounting in standard non abelian theory is also convergent here. therefore if
we have a local theory which has only one-loop divergencies to guarantee renormaliz-
ability of its noncommutative analogue it is enough to consider only one loop diagrams.
explicit calculations similar to [52]-[54] shows that noncommutative sym has the same
one-loop -function as usual sym with c2 = 2. therefore for d=4 extended supersym-
metric gauge models we get renormalizable theories.

6 deformation quantization

here we describe the cattaneo and felder path integral approach [51] to the kontsevich
[45] deformation quantization [41] formula. let m be a manifold with a poisson struc-
i,j=1 pij(x)if (x)jg(x)

ture on the algebra c (m) of functions on m, {f, g}(x) =pd

given by a skew-symmetric tensor pij, obeying the jacobi identity

pillpjk + pjllpki + pkllpij = 0,

(55)

the formal deformation quantization is given by means of the star-product, i.e. an
associative product on c (m)[[h]], such that for f, g  c (m)

f  g (x) = f (x)g(x) +

ih
2

{f, g}(x) + o(h2).

(56)

kontsevich [45] gave a formula for the star-product in terms of diagrams. the coef-
cient of (ih/2)n in f  g is given by a sum of terms labeled by diagram of order n.
to each diagram  of order n there corresponds a bidierential operator d whose
coecients are dierential polynomials, homogeneous of degree n in the components
pij of the poisson structure. kontsevich s formula is

f  g = f g +



2 !n
xn=1  ih

x of order n

w d(f  g).

(57)

the weight w is the integral of a dierential form over the conguration space of n
ordered points on the upper half plane.

cattaneo and felder [51] have shown that this formula can be interpreted as the
perturbative expansion of the path integral of a topological sigma model. the model
has two real bosonic elds x and a. x is a map from the disc d = {u  r2, |u|  1}
to m and a is a dierential 1-form on d taking values in the pull-back by x of the
cotangent bundle of m. in local coordinates, x is given by d functions x i(u) and a
by d dierential 1-forms ai(u) = ai,(u)du, i = 1, ..., d,  = 1, 2

the action reads

s[x, a] = zd

ai(u)  dx i(u) +

1
2

pij(x(u))ai(u)  aj(u).

(58)

the boundary condition for a is that for u  d, ai(u) vanishes on vectors tangent to
d.

this model was considered in [49].

it is a generalization of a model of two-

dimensional gravity with dynamical torsion [50], see [49].

the star product is given by the semiclassical expansion of the path integral

f  g (x) = z f (x(1))g(x(0))e

i

h s[x,a] yx()=x

dx da.

(59)

13

here 0, 1,  are any three cyclically ordered points on the unit circle. the path
integral is over all x and a subject to the boundary conditions x() = x, a(u)(n) = 0
if u  d and n is tangent to d.

to evaluate this path integral one has to take gauge xing and renormalization into
account. this action is invariant under the following innitesimal gauge transforma-
tions with innitesimal parameter i, which vanishes on the boundary of d:

x i = pij(x)j, ai = di  ipjk(x)ajk.

(60)

the model is quantized [51] by using the batalin-vilkovisky method. to the elds
x i, aj one adds ghost i, antighost i and the scalar lagrange multiplier i together
with their antields x +
i with complementary ghost number and
degree as dierential forms on d. the batalin-vilkovisky action in a xed gauge can
be written in terms of superelds as

i , a+j, +i, +

the perturbation expansion was obtained in [51] by taking x(u) = x + (u) with
a uctuation eld (u) with () = 0. the feynman propagators were deduced from
the kinetic part

of the gauge xed action. the other terms of s are considered as perturbations. in

7 noncommutative field theory on poisson man-

ifolds

in this section we discuss noncommutative eld theory on poisson manifolds. we would
like to use the star product as a genaralization of the moyal product to dene noncom-
mutative eld theory on general poisson manifolds by analogy with sects 4,5. however
if one uses the perturbation formula we immediately run into diculties because this
quantum eld theory will be nonrenormalizable. one can see this already on the torus
if one expands the exponent in moyal product into the series. then one gets vertices
including momenta in higher powers which spoil the renormalizability.

equations of motion for the action (57)

dx i + pij(x)daj = 0,

dai +

iplm(x)al  am = 0,

(71)

(72)

have the classical solution x(u) = x, ai(u) = 0. the perturbation expansion from
the previous section reproduces the kontsevich formula (57) however this expansion
is not an expansion around the classical solution x(u) = x. in particular if we apply
this expansion to the constant poisson structure then we get a series representing the
expansion of the moyal product.

we can obtain the semiclassical expansion if we use the taylor expansion of the

poisson structure

pij(x + (u)) = pij(x) + kp ij(x)k(u) + ... =

(73)

and then set s = s0 + sint where

pij(x) + bij(x, (u))

s0 = zdz ai  (di + di) + id  di +

1

pij(x)ai  aj

(74)

and

sint =

1

2 z z d2bij(x, (u)aiaj

(75)

now expanding the path integral in powers of sint we get the semiclassical expansion
around the classical solution x(u) = x. investigation of this diagram technique and
its applications to the eld theory on poisson manifolds will be the subject of a further
work.
