requiring general covariance and second order eld equa-
tions for the metric implies that gravitation in higher dimen-
sions can be described by theories with higher powers in the
curvature. the most general theory of this kind in d dimen-
sions has [(d  1)/2] free parameters.
it is shown that by
allowing the existence of a sector with non-vanishing torsion
in the theory, these parameters become xed in terms of the
gravitational and the cosmological constants. in even dimen-
sions, the lagrangian is written as a born-infeld-like theory.
in odd dimensions, the lagrangian is a chern-simons form
for the (a)ds or poincare local symmetry groups. consis-
tency of equations of motion implies that torsion may occur
explicitly in the lagrangian only for d = 4k  1. these tor-
sional lagrangians are related to the chern characters in 4k
dimensions. the coecients of the dierent terms in these
lagrangians can be shown to be quantized. these theories
posses a large class of interesting solutions, including black
holes and homogeneous cosmologies.

i. introduction

the possibility that the spacetime dimension be
greater than four has been explored in the context of uni-
ed quantum eld theories, ranging from kaluza-klein
(super)gravity to superstrings and m -theory. although
many dierent approaches have been followed in the gen-
eralizations to d > 4, little attention has been given to
purely geometrical higher-dimensional theories of grav-
ity. as a consequence, most models have been conceived
within the simplest generalization of general relativity
to higher dimensions.

a. beyond the einstein-hilbert action

it is the standard practice to describe the gravitational
eld assuming the spacetime geometry as given by the
einstein-hilbert (eh) action with or without cosmolog-
ical constant. this theory is the most reasonable choice
in dimensions three and four1, but it is not necessarily so

for d > 4. indeed, we would like to discuss some attrac-
tive alternatives that exist in higher dimensions when the
eh assumption is relaxed.

the idea that a more general theory could be employed
to describe the spacetime geometry in dimensions larger
than four even in the absence of torsion was rst con-
sidered some sixty years ago by lanczos [3]. more re-
cently, it was observed that the low energy eective la-
grangian for gravity obtained from string theory would
have curvature-squared terms [4], which are a potential
source of inconsistencies as they would in general bring
in ghosts. however, it was soon pointed out by zwiebach
[5] and zumino [6], that if the eective lagrangian would
contain the higher powers of curvature in particular com-
binations, only second order eld equations are produced
and consequently no ghosts. the eective lagrangian
obtained by this argument, was precisely of the form
proposed by lanczos for d = 5 and, for general d, by
lovelock [7].

on the other hand, in the more recent context of m -
theory there are further clues that point in this same di-
rection. for instance, it is expected that the low energy
regime of m -theory should be described by an eleven di-
mensional supergravity of new type with o-shell local
supersymmetry [8]. moreover, the perturbation expan-
sion for graviton scattering has led to conjecture that the
new supergravity lagrangian should contain higher pow-
ers of curvature [9]. a family of supergravity theories
that satisfy these conditions has been recently proposed
[10,11], and it should be expected that the purely grav-
itational sector of those new theories to be an extension
of ordinary eh gravity, as described below.

the previous discussion underscores the need to ad-
dress the question about the minimal requirements for a
consistent theory which includes gravity in any dimen-
sion. those requirements should include both general
covariance and second order eld equations for the met-
ric. for d > 4 the most general action for the metric
satisfying these criteria is a polynomial of degree [d/2] in
the curvature2, the lanczos-lovelock (ll) theory.

1in 1+1 dimensions, in order to write an action principle it
is necessary supply the theory with an extra scalar eld [1,2].

b. first order formalism

in standard general relativity, the ane structure of
spacetime (connection) is assumed to be derived from the
metric. the link between the two structures is the tor-
sion equation, which is often assumed as an o-shell re-
quirement for the spin connection. this assumption im-
plies that there are no independent propagating degrees
of freedom for torsion. however, in a theory contain-
ing fundamental spinors coupled to gravity, it is neces-
sary that the metric and ane properties of spacetime be
treated separately. a purely metric formulation, would
be sucient for the description of spinless particles and
elds because they only couple to the symmetric part of
the ane connection. on the other hand, spinors provide
a basis of irreducible representations for so(d  1, 1), or
so(d  1, 2), but not for gl(d). thus, spinors are natu-
rally dened relative to a local frame on the tangent space
rather than in relation to a coordinate system on the base
manifold. furthermore, spinors couple to the spacetime
torsion through minimal coupling with the spin connec-
tion (ab
 ), while the coupling with the spacetime metric
follows from a completely dierent relation with the viel-
bein (ea

).

in a theory containing fermions, it is therefore more
natural to look for a formulation of gravity in which ab
and ea are dynamically independent, with curvature and
torsion standing on similar footing. thus, the rst order
formalism should be assumed allowing the theory to de-
termine whether the spin connection is an independently
propagating eld or not.

in three and four dimensions, allowing  and e to be
dynamically independent does not modify the standard
picture in practice because any occurrence of torsion in
the action leads to torsion-free classical solutions (in vac-
uum)3.
in higher dimensions, however, theories that
include torsion can be dynamically quite dierent from
their torsion-free counterparts [12].

as we shall see below, the dynamical independence
of ab and ea also implies that the gravitation theories
in d = 2n  1 can be dened on a ber bundle, like a
yang-mills theory, a feature that is not shared by general
relativity except in three dimensions.

ii. higher dimensional gravity:

lanczos-lovelock theory

the ll theory regards gravity as the result of local
deformations of a d-dimensional riemannian manifold.
its lagrangian can be dened in four independent ways:

3in the case of coupling to spinning matter, the torsion equa-
tions allow expressing  in terms of e and the matter elds.

2

(i) as the most general invariant constructed from the
metric and curvature leading to second order eld equa-
tions for the metric [3,7].

(ii) as the most general d-form invariant under local
lorentz transformations, constructed with the vielbein,
the spin connection, and their exterior derivatives, with-
out using the hogde dual () [13].

(iii) as a linear combination of the dimensional con-
tinuation of all the euler densities of dimension 2p < d.
[6,14].

(iv) as the most general low energy eective gravi-
tational theory that can be obtained from string theory
[5].

denition (i) was historically the rst. it is appropri-
ate for the metric formulation and assumes vanishing tor-
sion. denition (ii) is slightly more general than (i) and
allows for a local rst-order formulation, and for torsion-
dependent terms in the action [12]. as a consequence
of (ii), the eld congurations that extremize the action
obey rst order equations for  and e.

assertion (iii) gives directly the ll lagrangian as a

polynomial of degree [d/2] in the curvature,

ig =z

[d/2]

xp=0

pl(p),

(1)

where p are arbitrary constants, and

l(p) = a1adra1a2    ra2p1a2pea2p+1    ead,

(2)

(wedge product of forms is understood throughout).

statement (iv) reects the empirical observation that
the vanishing of the superstring -function in d = 10
gives rise, in the low energy limit, to an eective action
of the form (1) [5]. in even dimensions, the last term in
the sum is the euler density, which does not contribute to
the equations of motion (although in the quantum theory,
this term in the partition function would assign dierent
weights to nonhomeomorphic geometries).

note that the rst two terms in the ll action (1) are
the eh theory. although general relativity is contained
in the ll action as a particular case, the actions with
higher powers of curvature dene theories which are dy-
namically very dierent from eh, and the classical solu-
tions of the full action are not even perturbatively related
to those of einsteins theory. however, to lowest order
in perturbation theory around a at, torsion-free back-
ground, all of the l(p) dened in (2) with p > 2 are total
derivatives [6].

the [(d + 1)/2] dimensionful constants p in the ll
action contrast with the two constants of the eh theory
(g and ). this feature could seem as an indication that
renormalizability of the ll theory would be even more
unattainable than in ordinary gravity. however, this is
not necessarily so. as is shown below, there are some
very special choices of p such that in odd dimensional
spacetimes the theory becomes invariant under a larger

gauge group. in this case the values of the coupling con-
stants p are protected by gauge invariance, which, if not
spoiled by anomalies, should actually improve renormal-
izability [15,16]. in the remaining of this section the ps
are selected according to the criterion that the integra-
bility (or consistency) conditions for the eld equations
would not impose additional algebraic constraints on the
curvature and torsion tensors.

a. consistency of equations of motion

consider the action (1), viewed as a functional of the
spin connection and the vielbein, ig = ig[ab, ea]. vary-
ing with respect to these elds, the generalized einstein
equations are obtained,

ea  ea = 0,
ab  eab = 0,

where we have dened

[ d1

ea :=

p(d  2p)e p

[ d1

e p
(7)
e p
ab := aba3adra3a4    ra2p1a2pt a2p+1ea2p+2    ead. (8)

equations (3) and (4) are independent lorentz tensor
(d  1)-forms, which should be solved for ab and ea. by
virtue of the bianchi identity, it is easy to check that the
exterior covariant derivative of (7) is related to (8) as

de p

a = (d  2p  1)ebe p+1
ba ,

(9)

where 0  p  [(d  1)/2]. this leads to the condition

dea =

[ d+1
2 ]

xp=1

p1(d  2p + 2)(d  2p + 1)ebe p

ba = 0.

(10)

on the other hand, taking the exterior product of (6)
with eb gives

ebeba =

[ d1
2 ]

xp=1

pp(d  2p)ebe p

ba = 0.

(11)

comparing the last two equations, one can see that
they are consistent for a generic choice of the coecients
p only if ebeba = 0 for all p. this in turn would imply
that for a generic conguration torsion must vanish.

pp(d  2p)e p

(6)

with

an interesting alternative way to curb the proliferation
of arbitrary coecients in the action is to consider the
case in which the rst order formalism is strictly neces-
sary, that is, when t a is not forced to vanish identically.
having this in mind, the strategy will be to exploit the
consistency of the eld equations in order to obtain rela-
tions that x the ps. it is at this point that even and
odd dimensions dier radically: equations (10) and (11)
have the same number of terms for d = 2n  1 but not
for d = 2n. we will treat each case separately.

1. d = 2n: born-infeld-like gravity

obviously t a = 0 solves (4). however, this equation
does not necessarily imply the vanishing of torsion in
general. first, one can observe that (4) is an exterior
covariant derivative,

eab = dtab = 0,

where we have dened the (d  2)-form,

(12)

(13)

tab :=

[ d1
2 ]

xp=1

ppt p

t p
ab = aba3adra3a4    ra2p1a2p ea2p+1    ead.

(14)

note that t p

ab satises the relations

ebt p

ab = e p1

a

,

dt p

ab = (d  2p)e p
ab,

(15)

(16)

for 1  p  [ d1
2 ]. dierentiating both sides of (15) and
using (16) one obtains that for d = 2n, equation (10) can
also be written as

dea =

n

xp=1

p1(d  2p + 2)[t bt p

ab  (d  2p)ebe p

ba] = 0.

(17)

comparing with (6) and (13), one can see that (17) is
satised without requiring vanishing torsion only if the
coecients p satisfy the following recursion relation:

(d  2p + 2)p1 = pp,

(18)

for some real number . then, equation (17) reads,

dea =

1


(t btab  ebeab) = 0.

(19)

therefore, in this case, the space of solutions of the
equations of motion does not require the vanishing of
torsion nor tab, but only that t a be a null vector of tab.

the solution of equation (18) is given by4

l(=0) =

with 0  p  n  1.
in this case we have only two
independent fundamental coecients in the lagrangian,
namely 0 and , which are related to the d-dimensional
newtons constant () and the cosmological constant ()

0 =

(21)

this choice of coecients allows writing the equations
of motion in a simpler form using the combination rab =
rab + 1

l2 eaeb, in fact, (3) and (4) can be written as

ea  ab1bd1
ab  aba3ad

rb1b2    rbd3bd2ebd1 = 0,
ra3a4    rad3ad2t ad1ead = 0.

(22)

in particular, one could consider a sector for which

tab =


2

aba3ad

ra3a4    rad1ad = 0,

(23)

which solves the equations of motion (22) identically
without requiring t a = 0. another interesting conse-
quence of the choice of coecients (20) is that the la-
grangian takes the form

l =


2n

a1ad

ra1a2    rad1ad.

(24)

this is the pfaan of the 2-form rab, and in this sense
it can be viewed as the born-infeld (bi)-like form [17],

l = 2n1(n  1)!sdet(cid:18)rab +

1

l2 eaeb(cid:19).

(25)

in four dimensions (25) reduces to a particular linear
combination of the einstein-hilbert action with cosmo-
logical constant and the euler density. since the euler
density is a closed form, it does not contribute to the
equations of motion. however, this term plays an im-
portant role in the denition of conserved charges for
gravitation [18] as well as in the quantum theory.

4the coecient n which multiplies the euler density in
(1) cannot be xed by the recursion relation (18) because
this term does not contribute to the equations of motion.
however, it is natural to choose n = 0(2)n, so that the
formula (20) will also be valid for p = n.
5for any dimension, l is a length parameter related with the
cosmological constant by  =  (d1)(d2)
. in the following
we will choose the negative sign, but the analysis does not
depend on this sign.

2l2

which is the dimensional continuation of the gauss-
bonnet invariant in (d  2) dimensions.

the two-form rab is a part of the ads curvature (c.f.
(29) below). this fact seems to suggest that the sys-
tem might be naturally described in terms of an ads
connection [19]. however, that is incorrect: in even di-
mensions, the lagrangian (24) is invariant under local
lorentz transformations and not under the entire ads
group. however, as shown in the next section, it is possi-
ble to construct gauge invariant theories of gravity under
the full ads group in odd dimensions.

2. d = 2n  1: local (a)ds chern-simons gravity

odd-dimensional spacetimes are very special in that
equations (10) and (11) have the same number of terms.
thus, if no further algebraic constraints on rab and t a
are assumed, equations (10) and (11) must be propor-
tional (ebeba = dea). this in turn is true if and only
if the following recursion relation for the constants p is
satised:



p
p+1

=

(p + 1)(d  2p  2)
(d  2p)(d  2p  1)

(26)

where 0  p  n  1. equation (3) has one more term
than (4), but the exterior covariant derivative of the last
term in (3) vanishes identically. the solution of (26) is
given by

p = 0

d(2)p

p (cid:19) .
(d  2p)(cid:18) n  1

(27)

this particular choice of coecients satises the consis-
tency condition without requiring the vanishing of torsion
or other subsidiary constraint.

on the other hand, equation (27) implies that in this
case we have only two independent constants in the ac-
tion, which can be expressed in terms of the gravita-
tional and the cosmological constants in the same way
as in even dimensions using (21). choosing the coe-
cients p as in (27), implies that equations (3) and (4) are
parts of a locally (a)ds covariant equation. this can be
made explicit if  and e are identied as dierent compo-
nents of an (a)ds connection a = 1
2 abjab + eajad+1 =
1
2 w abjab, where 6

6here, ab = diag(, +,   , +, sgn()).
in this case, 
can be chosen proportional to l so that the action becomes
dimensionless.

now, (3) and (4) can be written as dierent components
of the equation

where h i stands for a multilinear function in g, invari-
ant under cyclic permutations such as the trace for an
ordinary lie algebra. in this case, the only nonvanishing
brackets in the algebra are

(35)

(cid:10)ja1a2 ,    , jadad+1(cid:11) = a1ad+1.

starting from the ads theory (33) in odd dimen-
sions, a wigner-inonu contraction obtained by taking
the limit l  , yields a theory invariant under the
poincare group. this same result is obtained by choos-
ing p = n1
from the start. then, the lagrangian
p
(1) becomes 7

ra3a4    radad+1 = 0.

g = a1adra1a2    rad2ad1ead.

(36)

(30)

this equation is manifestly covariant under local ads
symmetry generated by w ab = ab, where  is
the exterior covariant derivative in the ads connection.
more explicitly, the above statement implies that the the-
ory is locally invariant under standard lorentz symmetry
beb and ab = dab), and also under local
(ea = a
translations,

ea = da

ab =

1
l2 (aeb  bea).

(31)

the consequences of this extra symmetry will be dis-
cussed in section iv.a. it is simple to check that the con-
dition ebeba = dea is automatically satised by virtue
of the identity

eab  0,

(32)

which is a consequence of the bianchi identity,  rab =
0.

consider now the action (1) for d = 2n  1 with the
choice (27). the resulting lagrangian is the euler-chern-
simons form, that is, its exterior derivative is the euler
form in 2n dimensions,

dlads

g 2n1 =


2n

a1a2n

ra1a2    ra2n1a2n

= e2n.

(33)

this action was proposed by chamseddine [20] and
also discussed in [21] in the context of torsion-free man-
ifolds. in general, a chern-simons (cs) lagrangian in
2n  1 dimensions is dened by the condition that its
exterior derivative be an invariant homogeneous polyno-
mial of degree n in the curvature, that is, a characteristic
class. in the case above, (33) denes the cs form for the
euler class 2n -form.

a generic cs lagrangian in 2n  1 dimensions for a

lie algebra g can be written as

dlg

2n1 =

2n1

n

 hfni ,

(34)

5

in this way the local symmetry of (1) is extended from
the lorentz group (so(d  1, 1)) to the poincare group
(iso(d  1, 1)). analogously to the anti-de sitter case,
one can see that the action depends on the poincare con-
nection a = eapa + 1
it is straightforward to
verify the invariance of the action (36) under local trans-
lations,

2 abjab.

ea = da, ab = 0.

(37)

if  is the lie algebra-valued zero-form,  = apa, the
transformations (37) are read from the general gauge
transformation for the connection, a = , where
 is the covariant derivative in the poincare connec-
tion. moreover, the lagrangian lp
g is a chern-simons
form. indeed, with the curvature for the poincare alge-
bra, f= da +a2 = 1
2 rabjab +t apa, the lagrangian (36)
satises (34), where the only nonvanishing components in
the bracket are

(cid:10)ja1a2 ,    , jad2ad1, pad(cid:11) = a1ad.

(38)

b. summary

the simplest example of chern-simons gravity occurs
in 2 + 1 dimensions, where the einstein-hilbert action
with cosmological constant is a genuine gauge theory of
the ads group, while for vanishing cosmological constant
it is invariant under local poincare transformations. al-
though this gauge invariance of 2+1 gravity is not always
emphasized, it lies at the heart of the proof of integrabil-
ity of the theory [15].

7this is the dimensional continuation of the euler density
from one dimension below, exactly as the three-dimensional
eh lagrangian without cosmological constant extends the
two-dimensional euler density. the local supersymmetric ex-
tension of (36) is also known [22].

as it has been shown in this section, there is only one
theory of gravity of the ll family for each dimension
which has a sector with unrestricted torsion. these the-
ories fall into two families, namely bi for d = 2n, and
cs for d = 2n  1. for both families there are only two
fundamental constants in the action,  and . in odd di-
mensions,  is a dimensionless integer, and the action is
invariant under local (a)ds transformation (or poincare
when  = 0).

the theories described above (bi, cs, eh and their
corresponding contractions) posses a unique maximally
symmetric background solution (ads or at respec-
tively). a more general family of theories with unique
maximally symmetric background correspond to the
choice:

p =

0d(2)p

(d  2p) (cid:18) k

p (cid:19) .

(39)

these theories reduce to eh for k = 1, and to bi and cs
for k = n  1, and can be shown to posses well behaved
black hole solutions [23]. with the exception of k = n 1
these theories must have vanishing torsion and will not
be discussed in what follows.

c. dynamical behavior

when torsion is not set equal to zero, the standard
variational principles rst, second and 1.5 order are no
longer necessarily equivalent. for example, varying the
ll action with respect to e  in the 1.5 order formalism
[24], yields

ill =

ill
ea ea +

ill
bc

bc
ea ea,

which would reduce to the einstein equations (3) (second
order formalism) provided ill
bc = 0 (4). thus, in partic-
ular, in the presence of spinors these formalisms would
be dierent because in the second order case, the torsion
equation (4) is imposed as a constraint, but this is in fact
a matter of choice.

another consequence of imposing a dynamical depen-
dence between  and e through the torsion equation
is that it spoils the possibility of interpreting the local
translational invariance as a gauge symmetry of the ac-
tion. consider the action of the poincare or (a)ds groups
on the elds as given by (37) or by (31) respectively; tak-
ing the torsion condition t a = 0 as a denition would
imply

ab =

ab
ec ec,

(40)

which would be inconsistent with the action of the local
translations (37) on these elds. thus, the spin connec-
tion and the vielbein the soldering between the base
manifold and the tangent space cannot be identied as

6

the compensating elds for local lorentz rotations and
translations or (a)ds boosts, respectively.

thus, gravitation can be realized as a truly gauge the-
ory with ber structure, in which ab and ea are con-
nection elds, only if the torsion is not constrained to
vanish. as was shown above, this realization only exists
for odd dimensions for the cs lagrangian.

when torsion is set equal to zero, the number of de-
grees of freedom for a generic ll system has been shown
to be the same as in the eh theory, namely d(d3)
[14]. however,
in the cs theory, without constrain-
ing the torsion, there are additional degrees of freedom
[26] which can be associated to the contorsion tensor
kab := ab  ab(e), where ab(e) is the solution of
t a = 0.

2

in view of the preceding analysis, there seems to be
no reason to exclude torsion from the lagrangian itself.
in the next section we explore the possibility of adding
torsion explicitly to the action.

iii. adding torsion in the lagrangian

the generalization of the lovelock theory to include
torsion explicitly is obtained assuming denition (ii).
this is a cumbersome problem due to the lack of an al-
gorithm for classifying all possible invariants constructed
from ea, rab and t a. in ref. [12] a useful recipe to gen-
erate all those invariants is given.

as with the ll lagrangian, the explicit inclusion of
torsion brings in a number of arbitrary dimensionful co-
ecients k analogous to the ps. also in this case, one
can chose the s so as to enlarge the local lorentz in-
variance into the ads gauge symmetry8 if no additional
structure (e.g., inverse metric, hodge dual (), etc.) is
assumed, ads invariants can only be produced in 4k and
4k  1 dimensions.

this can be seen as follows:

invariance under ads
requires that the d-form be at least lorentz invariant.
then, in order for these scalars to be invariant under
ads as well, it is sucient that they be expressible in
terms of the ads connection (28). as is well-known (see,
e.g., [27]), in even dimensions, the only d-form invariant
under so(n ) constructed according to the recipe men-
tioned above are the euler character for n = d only,
and the chern characters for any n . an important
dierence between these invariants is that under a par-
ity transformation the former is even while the latter is
odd. parity is dened by the sign change induced by a
simultaneous inversion of one coordinate in the tangent

8here so(d) and so(d  1, 1) will be used indistinctly to
represent the lorentz group in d dimensions, while the d-
dimensional (a)ds group will be denoted by so(d  1, 2),
so(d, 1) or so(d + 1).

space and in the base manifold. thus, for instance the
euler characters, a1adra1a2    rad1ad, are even under
parity, while the lorentz-chern characters, ra1
   ra2n
a1 ,
b2
and the torsional invariants such as eara
bt b are parity
odd. in the previous section we discussed all possible la-
grangians of the form [r]p[e]d2p , in what follows we
concentrate on the construction of the pure gravity sector
as a gauge theory which is parity-odd. this construction
was discussed in [29], and also briey in [10,11].

in even dimensions the only ads-invariant d-forms are,
apart from the euler classes, linear combinations of prod-
ucts of the type

pr1rs = cr1    crs,

with 2(r1 + r2 +    + rs) = d. here

cr = tr(fr),

(41)

(42)

denes the rth chern character of so(n ). now, since
the curvature two-form f is in the vector representation
it is antisymmetric in the group indices. thus, the pow-
ers rj in (42) are necessarily even, and therefore (41)
vanishes unless d is a multiple of four. these results can
be summarized in the following lemmas:

lemma 1: for d = 4k, the only parity-odd d-forms
invariant under the ads

built from ea, rab and t a,
group, are the chern characters for so(d + 1).

lemma 2: for d = 4k + 2, there are no parity-odd
so(d+1)-invariant d-forms constructed from ea, rab and
t a.

in view of this, it is clear why attempts to construct
purely gravitational theories with local ads invariance
in even dimensions have proven unsuccessful in spite of
several serious eorts [19,30].

since the expressions pr1rs in (41) are 4k-dimensional
closed forms, they are at best boundary terms which do
not contribute to the classical equations (although they
would assign dierent phases to congurations with non-
trivial torsion in the quantum theory). the forms pr1rs
can be expressed locally as the exterior derivative of a
(4k  1)-form,

pr1rs = dlads

t 4k1(w ).

(43)

this implies that for each collection {r1,    rs}, lads
t 4k1
is a good lagrangian for the ads group (so(4k)) in 4k1
dimensions9. in a given dimension, the most general la-
grangian of this sort is a linear combination of all pos-
sible lads
it can be directly checked that these
lagrangians necessarily involve torsion explicitly.

t 4k1s.

these results can be summarized in the following

theorem:

there
are two families of rst-order gravitational lagrangians
l(e, ), invariant under local ads transformations:

in odd-dimensional spacetimes,

a: euler-chern-simons forms lads

g 2n1, in d = 2n  1
[parity-even]. their exterior derivatives are the euler
characters in 2n dimensions and do not involve torsion
explicitly, and

b: pontryagin-chern-simons forms lads

t 4k1, in d =
4k  1 [parity-odd]. their exterior derivatives are chern
characters in 4k dimensions and involve torsion explic-
itly.

it must be stressed that locally ads-invariant gravity
theories exist only in odd dimensions. they are genuine
gauge systems, whose action comes from topological in-
variants in d+1 dimensions. these topological invariants
can be written as the trace of a homogeneous polynomial
of degree n in the ads curvature. obviously, for dimen-
sions 4k  1 both a- and b-families exist.

a. examples for d=2n

in d = 4, the only local lorentz-invariant 4-forms con-

structed with the recipe just described are [12]:

e4 = abcdrabrcd
leh = abcdrabeced
l = abcdeaebeced
c2 = ra
brb
a
lt1 = rabeaeb
lt2 = t ata.

the rst three terms are even under parity and the
rest are odd. of these, e4 and c2 are topological invari-
ant densities (closed forms): the euler character and the
second chern character for so(4), respectively. the re-
maining four terms dene the most general gravity action
in four dimensions,

i =zm4

[leh + l + lt1 + lt2] .

(44)

the two rst terms in the r.h.s. can be combined with
e4 into the born-infeld form (25) which is locally invari-
ant under so(d), but not under so(d + 1). it can also
be seen, that by choosing  = , the last two terms are
combined into a topological invariant density, the nieh-
yan form [31]. this choice implies that the entire odd
part of the action becomes a boundary term. further-
more, c2, lt1 and lt2 can be combined into the second
chern character of the ads group,

ra

brb

a +

2
l2 (t ata  rabeaeb) = ra

b

rb
a.

(45)

the form (45) is the only ads invariant constructed just
with ea, ab and their exterior derivatives, and therefore
there are no locally ads-invariant gravity theories in four
dimensions.

in view of lemmas (1) and (2), the corresponding ads-
invariant functionals in higher dimensions can be written
in terms of the ads curvature as linear combinations of
terms like

ir1rs =zm

cr1    crs ,

(46)

where cr = t r[( ra
b)r] is the r-th chern character for
the ads group, and dim(m ) = r1 +    + rs is a multiple
of four. for example, in d = 8 the chern characters are

c4 = t r[( ra

b)4],

and

(c2)2 = t r[( ra

b)2]t r[( ra

b)2].

(47)

(48)

the corresponding integrals i4 and i2,2 are topological
invariants that characterize the maps so(9)  m8. fur-
thermore, as already mentioned, ir1rs vanishes if one of
the rs happens to be odd, which is the case in 4k + 2
dimensions. thus, one concludes that there are no tor-
sional ads-invariant gauge theories for gravity in even
dimensions.

b. examples for d=2n-1

the simplest example occurs in three dimensions,
where there are two locally ads invariant lagrangians,
namely, the einstein-hilbert with cosmological constant,

lads

g 3 =

1
l

abc[rabec +

1
3l2 eaebec],

and the exotic lagrangian [15]

lads

t 3 = l

3() + 2eat a,

where

l

a.

(49)

(50)

(51)

the lagrangians (49, 50, 51) are the euler, the pon-
tryagin and the lorentz chern-simons forms, respec-
tively. note that in (50), the local ads symmetry xes
the relative coecient between l
3(), and the torsion
term eat a. the most general action for gravitation in
d = 3, which is invariant under so(4) is therefore the
linear combination lads

g 3 + lads
t 3 .

for d = 4k  1, the number of possible exotic forms
grows as the partitions of k, p(k), in correspondence with
the number of composite chern invariants of the form:

p{rj } = yrjp(k)

crj .

(52)

thus, the most general lagrangian in 4k1 dimensions

takes the form

lads

g 4k1 + {rj }lads

t {rj } 4k1,

(53)

t {rj } 4k1 = pr1rs, with pj rj = 4k. these

where dlads
lagrangians are not boundary terms and, unlike the
even-dimensional case, they have proper dynamics. for
example, in seven dimensions one nds [29]

where l

(54)

it should be noted that the coecients  and {rj }
are arbitrary and dimensionless. as is shown in the next
section, these coecients must be quantized by an exten-
sion of the argument used to prove that  in (33) is also
quantized [16].

c. quantization of parameters

as it was shown in [16], in odd dimensions, the coef-
cient  is quantized. we now extend that argument to
show that the s in (53) are also quantized. consider the
action for the connection w on a (2n  1)-dimensional,
compact, oriented, simply connected manifold m with-
out boundary, which is the boundary of an oriented (2n)-
dimensional manifold . by stokes theorem, the action
for (53) can be written as an integral on ,

i ads

 [w ] =z(cid:0)e2n + {r}p{r}(cid:1) .

(55)

(for d = 4k + 1 the last term is absent as the p{r}s
vanish). i ads
 [w ] describes a topological eld theory on
 for w which should be insensitive to the change of  by
another orientable manifold  with the same boundary,
i.e.,  = m = . thus we have

i ads
 [w ] = i ads



[w ] +z(cid:0)e2n + {r}p{r}(cid:1) ,

(56)

where the orientation of  has been reversed. now,  :=
   is a closed oriented manifold formed by joining 
and  continuously along m . then (56) can be written
as

i ads
 [w ] = i ads



[w ] + [] + {rj}p{rj}[],

(57)

where p{r} =r p{rj }.

8

substituting i by i would have no eect in the path
integral for the quantum theory provided the dierence
[] = ii is an integer multiple of plancks constant
h which, in addition, cannot change under continuous
deformations of the elds. thus, we have

[] = [] + {rj}c{rj}[]

(58)

= mh.

now, since the euler and the pontryagin numbers []
and p{rj }[] are integers, the coecients  and {rj } are
necessarily quantized.

the preceding argument is rigorously valid for a
manifold with euclidean signature.
if m is locally
minkowskian one can apply the same reasoning to the
analytic continuation of the path integral in which the
base manifold m and its tangent space t (m )x are si-
multaneously wick-rotated. this has the eect that the
group of rotations on t (m )x may have nontrivial homo-
topy group, 2n1[so(2n)] so that the chern characters
can be nonzero.

iv. exact solutions

as

the local

stressed above,

symmetry of odd-
dimensional gravity can be extended from lorentz to ads
by an appropriate choice of the free coecients in the
action. the resulting lagrangians both with and with-
out torsion terms are chern-simons d-forms dened in
terms of the ads connection a, whose components in-
clude the vielbein and the spin connection [see equation
(28)]. thus, the eld equations obtained by varying the
vielbein and the spin connection respectively, can be writ-
ten in an explicitly ads-covariant form

< f n1jab >= 0,

(59)

where f= 1
2
given by (29) and jab are the ads generators.

rabjab is the ads curvature with rab

obviously, any locally ads spacetime is a solution of
(59). apart from anti-de sitter space itself, some inter-
esting spacetimes with this feature are the topological
black holes of ref. [32], and some black branes with con-
stant curvature worldsheet [33]. also, for each d there
is a unique static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically
ads black hole solution [21], as well as their topologi-
cal extensions which have nontrivial event horizons [34].
similarly, friedman-robertson-walker cosmologies have
also been found10 [35].

10it can be seen that all the geometries described above can
be extended into solutions of the gravitational bi theory in
even dimensions.

9

a. consequences of local ads symmetry

the presence of a local ads symmetry gives rise to an
apparent paradox: under the action of an ads transfor-
mation which is not contained in the lorentz subgroup
(31), the curvature and torsion tensors transform as:

 rab =

1
l2 (at b  bt a),

t a =  ra

bb.

(60)

thus, in general, a solution with non-vanishing ads
curvature is mapped into another which is dieomorphi-
cally inequivalent. in fact, the metric transform under
(31) as

g = g  ea(t a

),

(61)

where  stands for a dieomorphism whose parameter
satisfy a = ea
. this implies that in the presence of
torsion, the new metric is in general not equivalent to
the old one. furthermore, even if there is no torsion to
begin with, by virtue of (61) the new metric will eventu-
ally be dieomorphically inequivalent to higher order.

at rst glance, it would seem that these two solutions
would be physically inequivalent; in fact, these solutions
have dierent geodesic structure. the apparent paradox
stems from the fact that the geodesic equation is lorentz
covariant, but not ads covariant. the crucial point, is
what one means by physically equivalent. the situ-
ation is analogous to the transformation of the electro-

magnetic eld under a lorentz boost:
b elds
transform, and even if one start with a purely magnetic
(electric) conguration, to second order in (v/c) one nds
both.


e and

v. summary and discussion

the presence of unconstrained torsion in higher dimen-
sional gravity allows xing the [(d  1)/2] free parame-
ters of the ll theory in terms of the gravitational and
the cosmological constants. in even dimensions, it can
be assumed the torsion to be a null vector of tab dened
in (23), which is in general much weaker than imposing
t a = 0. the resulting theory has a born-infeld form,
and possesses interesting exact solutions.

in odd dimensions, torsion needs not be constrained at
all in the theory. this allows combining the vielbein and
the spin connection as dierent components of an (a)ds
or poincare connection. in this case the lagrangian is
a chern-simons form whose local symmetry is enlarged
form so(d) to so(d + 1) or iso(d).

the existence of propagating degrees of freedom 
associated with the spacetime contorsion kab, makes it
natural to consider torsional terms explicitly in the la-
grangian as well. such terms can be consistently added

to the lagrangian only d = 4k1, which must possess lo-
cal invariance under the (a)ds group (so(d + 1)). in the
latter case, the lagrangians are dened such that their
exterior derivatives are given by all the possible prod-
ucts of the chern characters in 4k dimensions, which are
parity-odd. thus, for d = 4k  1, the most general the-
ory which allow the existence of independent propagating
degrees of freedom for the contorsion, has a new set of
parameters the {r}s, which, together with the gravi-
tational constant (), are necessarily quantized.

chern-simons theories are constructed on the basis of
a single connection eld on a ber bundle. contact with
gravity is made by identifying one of the components of
the gauge connection (ea
) as the vielbein, that is, the
soldering between the the base manifold (spacetime) and
the tangent space. as shown in [15], in 2 + 1 dimen-
sions, one of the key points in quantizing gravity is to
consider the uctuations around vanishing vielbein and
spin connection. that means that at the quantum level,
spacetime metric is as relevant as in yang-mills theory.
on the other hand, in the purely metric second or-
der theory, writing the action requires the inverse metric,
g, which makes it impossible to work in the unbroken
phase ea = ab = 0).

the arguments traced above, suggest that the extra
ingredient (identifying ea
 as the soldering) should be im-
plemented at the last stage, at the classical level. on the
other hand, cs actions have no dimensionful constants
when written in terms of the connection w ab (28), so
that the elds have canonical dimension 1 and the action
describes a bona de ads gauge system. the correspond-
ing quantum theory as well as its local supersymmetric
extensions would be renormalizable by power counting
and possibly nite [16].

these theories, including torsional terms or not, pos-
sess a large class of interesting solutions, including variety
of black holes for which the mass can be obtained through
a surface integral [37] and homogeneous cosmologies11.

the stability and positivity of the energy for the solu-
tions of these theories is a nontrivial problem. however
some insights can be gained from the supersymmetric
extension of the theory, for in that case the expectation
values of dierent charges are related and bogomolnyi
bounds can be established. the supersymmetric exten-
sion of gravity theories described here for d = 4k  1
was discussed in [10], and in general for d = 2n  1, in
[11]. the key steps in that construction are: (a) assume
that pure gravity is described by the chern-simons la-
grangians including torsional terms from the start. (b)

11the problem of constructing conserved charges in chern-
simons theories has been analyzed in [26] from a hamilto-
nian point of view, and in [36], in the lagrangian approach.
however, these approaches are inappropriate, for example, to
compute the mass of solutions of a purely gravitational cs
theory.

10

identify the supersymmetric extension of ads in odd di-
mensions as the gauge group, so that supersymmetry is
realized in the ber rather than in the base manifold12.
(c) find invariant tensors which allows writing the cs
action for the super ads connection which contains the
pure gravitational theory considered in (a).

the minimal supersymmetric extensions of the ads
algebra can be constructed in a straightforward manner
and with an explicit representation. the original scheme,
devised by van holten and van proeyen [38], gives the
superalgebras in dimensions 1, 2, 3, mod8, but it can be
easily generalized to all odd dimensions [29]. the rst ex-
ample of a supergravity action containing the ll-action
was worked out by chamseddine in ve dimensions [20].
this construction, however cannot be generalized to ar-
bitrary higher odd dimensions unless torsional terms are
introduced in the gravitational sector. in 4k  1 dimen-
sions spinors in a chiral representation of so(4k) are re-
quired [39]. this can only be achieved if the gravita-
tional lagrangian is a particular combination of lads
and lads
quires the inclusion of torsion.

t 2n1
g 2n1. this implies that minimal supergravity re-

in d = 4k + 1 this issue does not arise because the
torsion invariants in d = 4k + 2 identically vanish, the
corresponding supergravity theories are based only on
lg and require complex spinors and larger unitary su-
perextensions of the ads group as in [20].

keeping in mind the above, it can shown that around
an appropriate background, the conserved charges sat-
isfy a central extension of the super ads algebra13.
therefore, the bogomolnyi bound on the bosonic charges
can be read from the anticommutator of the fermionic
symmetry generators, and as usual, solutions with killing
spinors saturate the bound. in d = 2n  1, one should
expect the existence of a new kind of 2n-dimensional the-
ory at the boundary. that theory should be constructed
on the generalization of the centrally extended gauge al-
gebra, which can be viewed as the superconformal alge-
bra at the boundary14. these theories should be a rich
arena to test the recently conjectured ads/cft corre-
spondence [41].
