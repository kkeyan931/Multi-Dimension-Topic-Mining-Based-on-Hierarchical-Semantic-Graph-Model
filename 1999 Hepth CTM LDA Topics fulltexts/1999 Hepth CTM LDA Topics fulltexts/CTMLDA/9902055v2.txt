we study large dimensions and low string scale in four-dimensional compactications of
type ii theories of closed strings at weak coupling. we nd that the fundamental string
scale, together with all compact dimensions, can be at the tev, while the smallness
of the string coupling accounts for the weakness of gravitational interactions. this is
in contrast to the situation recently studied in type i theories, where the string scale
can be lowered only at the expense of introducing large transverse dimensions felt by
gravity only. as a result, in these type ii strings, there are no strong gravity eects
at the tev, and the main experimental signature is the production of kaluza-klein
excitations with gauge interactions.
in the context of type iib theories, we nd a
new possibility providing a rst instance of large non-transverse dimensions at weak
coupling: two of the internal dimensions seen by gauge interactions can be at the tev,
with the string scale and all other dimensions at intermediate energies of the order
of 1011 gev, where gravity becomes also strong. finally, using duality, we provide a
perturbative description for the generic case of large dimensions in the heterotic string.
in particular, we show that the two type ii theories above describe the cases of one
and two heterotic large dimensions. a new m-theory derivation of heterotic-type ii
duality is instrumental for this discussion.

1 introduction

large dimensions are of particular interest in string theory because of their possible use to

explain outstanding physical problems, such as the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking

[1], the gauge hierarchy [2, 3] and the unication of fundamental interactions [4, 5, 6].

in the context of perturbative heterotic string theory, large tev dimensions are moti-

vated by supersymmetry breaking which identies their size to the breaking scale. although

the full theory is strongly coupled in ten dimensions, there are many quantities that can be

studied perturbatively, such as gauge couplings that are often protected by non renormal-

isation theorems [1, 7], as well as all soft breaking terms because of the extreme softness

of the supersymmetry breaking mechanism, in close analogy with the situation at nite

temperature [1, 8]. an obvious question is whether there is some dual theory that provides

a perturbative description of the above models.

more recently, it was proposed that the observed gauge hierarchy between the planck

and electroweak scales may be due to the existence of extra large (transverse) dimensions,

seen only by gravity which becomes strong at the tev [2]. this scenario can be realised

[9, 10] in the context of a weakly coupled type i string theory with a string scale at the

tev [11] and the standard model living on d-branes, transverse to p large dimensions of

size ranging from (sub)millimeter (for p = 2) to a fermi (for p = 6). as we will discuss

below, these models are dual to the heterotic ones with n = 4, 5 or 6 large dimensions.

more precisely, the cases n = 4 and n = 6 correspond to p = 2 and p = 6, respectively,

while the description of n = 5 uses an anisotropic type i theory with 5 large and one extra

large dimension.

in this work, we study large dimensions in the context of weakly coupled type ii string

compactications. one of the main characteristics of these theories is that non-abelian

gauge symmetries appear non-perturbatively, even at very weak coupling, when the com-

pactication manifold is singular [12, 13]. in particular, on the type iia (iib) side, they

3

can be obtained from even (odd) d-branes wrapped around even (odd) collapsing cycles.

as we will show in section 2, we nd two novel possibilities which cannot be realised

perturbatively either in the heterotic or in type i constructions.

the rst case consists of type iia four-dimensional (4d) compactications with all

internal radii of the order of the string length, that can be as large as tev1 due to a

superweak string coupling. despite this, standard model gauge couplings remain of order

unity because their magnitude is determined by the geometry of the internal manifold and

not by the value of the string coupling1. this scenario oers an alternative to the brane

framework for solving the gauge hierarchy, with very dierent experimental signals. there

are no missing energy events from gravitons escaping into the bulk [2, 9, 14], while string

excitations interact with planck scale suppressed couplings. as a result, the production of

kaluza-klein (kk) excitations with gauge interactions remain the only experimental probe

[1, 15]. furthermore, the problem of proton decay and avor violation becomes in principle

much easier to solve than in low energy quantum gravity models. this model will be shown

in section 4 to be dual to the heterotic string with n = 2 large dimensions.

the second case consists of type iib theory with two large dimensions at the tev and

the string tension at an intermediate scale of the order of 1011 gev. the string coupling is

of order unity (but perturbative), while the largeness of the 4d planck mass is attributed

to the large tev dimensions compared to the string length. gravity becomes strong at the

intermediate scale and the main experimental signal is again the production of kk gauge

modes. however, the gauge theory above the compactication scale is very dierent than

in the previous type iia case. in fact, this model oers the rst instance of large radius

along non-transverse directions and contains an energy domain where its eective theory

becomes six-dimensional below the string scale. this limit corresponds to a non-trivial

infrared conformal point described by a tensionless self-dual string [16]. this model is

1this situation can also be realised in type i string theory but only in six dimensions [11, 9].

4

again dual to the heterotic string with a single (n = 1) large dimension at the tev.

of course, in the above two examples, one can increase the type iia string coupling or

lower the type iib string scale by introducing some extra large dimensions transverse to the

5-brane where gauge interactions are localised. in particular, we will show that the heterotic

string with n = 3 large tev dimensions is described by a type iia compactication with a

string scale and two longitudinal dimensions at the tev, four transverse dimensions at the

fermi scale, and order 1 string coupling.

the paper is organised as follows. in section 2, we study tev strings and tev dimen-

sions in type ii theories and we describe the rst two examples mentioned above. in section

3, we review briey the string dualities among heterotic, type i and type ii theories, and

give the basic relations we use in the sequel; in particular, we give a simple (yet heuristic)

derivation of heterotictype iia duality in the framework of m-theory. in section 4, we

discuss large dimensions in heterotic compactications and provide a perturbative descrip-

tion of all cases using heterotic  type i or heterotic  type ii dualities. for completeness,

in section 5, we examine large dimensions in type ii theories, and show how the heterotic

theories of section 4 are recovered. finally, section 6 contains some concluding remarks.

2 type ii theories with low string scale

the standard model gauge interactions can be in principle embedded within three types

of four-dimensional string theories, obtained by compactication of the ten-dimensional

heterotic, type ii and type i theories. on the heterotic side, gauge interactions appear in

the perturbative spectrum and, like the gravitational interactions, are controlled by the

string coupling gh.

in type i theories, gauge interactions are described by open strings

and conned on d-branes, whereas gravity propagates in the bulk; both interactions are

controlled again by the string coupling gi, although gauge forces are enhanced by a factor

5

1/gi.

in type ii theories, the matching condition forbids the existence of non-abelian

vector particles in the perturbative spectrum; however, gauge interactions do arise non-

perturbatively at singularities of the k3-bered calabi-yau manifold, from d2-branes (in

type iia) or d3-branes (in type iib) wrapping the vanishing cycles2. the gauge symmetry

is dictated by the intersection matrix of the vanishing two-cycles in the k3 ber, whereas

extra matter arises from vanishing cycles localised at particular points on the base [18]. as a

result, gauge interactions are localised on 5-branes at the singularities with a gauge coupling

given by a geometric modulus (the size of the base in type iia), whereas gravitational eects

are still controlled by the string coupling gii.

more precisely, the gauge and gravitational kinetic terms in the eective type iia four-

dimensional eld theory are, in a self-explanatory notation:

siia =z d4xg(cid:18) 1

g2
6iia

r5r6

ii r +

f 2(cid:19) ,

(1)

where lii is the type ii string length, g6iia is the six-dimensional string coupling, and r5r6 is

the two-dimensional volume of the base, along the 5-brane where gauge elds are localised.

for simplicity, we consider here the base to be a product of two circles with radii r5 and

r6. in eq. (1) and henceforth we set all numerical factors to one, although we take them

into account in the numerical examples. identifying the coecient of r with the inverse
planck length l2
ym, one gets:

(2)

keeping the yang-mills coupling of order unity implies that r5r6 is of order l2

ii, while g6iia

is a free parameter that allows to move the string length away from the planck scale. as a

result, one can take the type ii string scale to be at the tev, keeping all compactication

radii to be at the same order of tev1, by introducing a tiny string coupling of the order of

2here we take as an example the well-understood case of n = 2 supersymmetric compactications,

since it already exhibits the main features of interest. our discussion carries over trivially to n = 1 models

obtained for instance by freely acting orbifolds [17].

6

1014. we stress again that this situation cannot be realised in heterotic or type i theories

at weak coupling.

this scenario is very dierent from the tev strings arising in type i theory, where the

string coupling is xed by the 4d gauge coupling, while the type i string scale is lowered by

introducing large transverse dimensions implying that gravity becomes strong at the tev

scale. here, all internal dimensions have string size (tev1) and gravitational/string in-

teractions are extremely suppressed by the 4d planck mass. as a result, regge excitations

cannot be detected in particle accelerators and the main experimental signal is the produc-

tion of kk excitations of gauge particles, along the (5, 6) directions parallel to the 5-brane

where gauge interactions are localised, due to the singular character of the compactica-

tion manifold; furthermore, these excitations come in multiplets of n = 4 supersymetry,

which is recovered in the six-dimensional limit. quarks and leptons, on the other hand,

do not in general have kk excitations since matter elds are localised at particular points

of the base [18]; they look similar to the twisted elds in heterotic orbifold compactica-

tions. notice the similarity of these predictions with those of heterotic string with large

dimensions, despite its strong 10d coupling [1]. the requirement of n = 4 excitations was,

there, a way to keep the running of gauge couplings logarithmic above the compactication

scale. in fact, as we will show in section 4, the above type ii models are dual to heterotic

compactications with two large tev dimensions.

an obvious advantage of this scenario is that several potential phenomenological prob-

lems, such as proton decay and avor violations, appear much less dangerous than in type

i tev strings, since they are restricted to the structure of kk gauge modes only, and one

does not have to worry about string excitations. model building, on the other hand, be-

comes more involved since it requires a deeper understanding of the gauge theory on the

5-brane localised at the singular points of k3; due to the weakness of the string coupling,

the dynamics of the gauge theory is determined by classical string theory in a strongly

7

curved background, which can be analysed, for instance, in the framework of geometric

engineering [18].

a related question is the one of gauge hierarchy, which in the present context consists

of understanding why the type iia string coupling is so small. the technical aspect of

this problem is whether string interactions decouple from the eective gauge theory on

the 5-brane, in the limit of vanishing coupling. although naively such a decoupling seems

obvious, there may be subtleties related to the non-perturbative origin of non-abelian gauge

symmetries due to the singular character of the compactication manifold. in fact, we would

like to argue that there are in general logarithmic singularities similar to the case of having

an eective transverse dimensionality d = 2 in the d-brane/type i scenario of tev strings

[3].

the argument is based on threshold corrections to gauge and gravitational couplings,

that take the form:

 = b ln(a) + reg(ti) ,

(3)

where the rst term corresponds to an infrared (ir) divergent contribution, regularised by

an ir momentum cuto , b is a numerical -function coecient, and reg is a function

of the moduli ti, which in n = 2 compactications belong to vector supermultiplets. for

dimensional reasons, we have also introduced an ultraviolet (uv) scale a, which naively

should be identied with the type ii string length lii. however because of the relation

(2), in supergravity units,  would acquire a dependence on the 4d string coupling, which

is impossible because it belongs to a neutral hypermultiplet that cannot mix with vector

multiplets in the low energy theory. this suggests that a should be identied with lp and

thus, in string units, there should be an additional contribution depending logarithmically

on the string coupling. this can also be understood either as a result of integration over

the massive charged states which have non perturbative origin, implying a uv cuto pro-

portional to (liigii)1, or from heterotictype ii duality that we will discuss in sections 3

8

and 4. such a logarithmic dependence on the string coupling has also been observed in

gravitational thresholds [19].

the logarithmic sensitivity on gii is very welcome because it allows in principle the

possible dynamical determination of the hierarchy by minimising the eective potential.

note that the one-loop vacuum energy in non-supersymmetric type ii vacua behaves as
  l4
(lplstr)2. this should be contrasted to the generic case of softly broken supersymmetry,

ii and thus is dierent from a quadratically divergent contribution that would go as

as well as to tev type i strings with large transverse dimensions, where the cancellation of

this quadratic divergence implies a condition on the bulk energy density [9].

above, we discussed the simplest case of type ii compactications with string scale at

the tev and all internal radii having the string size. in principle, one can allow some of

the k3 transverse directions to be large. from eq. (2), it follows that the string coupling

gii = g6iia(vk3/l4

ii)1/2, with vk3 the volume of k3, increases making gravity strong at

distances lp(vk3/l4

at the tev when gii is of order unity. this corresponds to vk3/l4

ii)1/2 larger than the planck length. in particular, it can become strong
ii  1026. it follows that
in the isotropic case there are 4 transverse dimensions at a fermi, while in the anisotropic
case vk3  rl4
for  = 2. a more detailed analysis will be given in section 5.

the size of the transverse radii r increases with  and reaches a micron

ii

we now turn on type iib. as in type iia, non-abelian gauge symmetries arise at sin-

gularities of k3 from d3-branes wrapping around vanishing 2-cycles times a 1-cycle of the

base. therefore, at the level of six dimensions, they correspond to tensionless strings [16].

the gauge and gravitational kinetic terms in the eective type iib four-dimensional action

can be obtained from eq. (1) by t-duality with respect, for instance, to the 6th direction:

when all k3 radii have string scale size. as a result, the type iib string scale can be at

intermediate energies 1011 gev when the compactication scale r1 is at the tev. the

string coupling is then of order unity and gravity becomes strong at the intermediate string

scale. this brings back some worry on proton stability although in a much milder form

than in tev scale quantum gravity models. of course, the string scale can be lowered by

decreasing the string coupling or by introducing large transverse dimensions in the k3 part.

in the latter case, gravitational interactions become strong at lower energies.

this result provides the rst instance of a weakly coupled string theory with large

longitudinal dimensions seen by gauge interactions.

in fact, as we will show in section

4, this theory describes heterotic compactications with a single large dimension. the

existence of such dimension is motivated by supersymmetry breaking in the process of

compactication [1]. note that the physics above the compactication scale but below the

type iib string scale is described by an eective six-dimensional theory of a tensionless

string [16]. this theory possesses a non-trivial infrared dynamics at a xed point of the

renormalisation group [20]4. it would be interesting to study the dynamics of such theories

in detail from the viewpoint of the reduced four-dimensional gauge theory.

3 heterotictype itype ii triality

here, we review briey the basic ingredients of the dualities between the heterotic, type i

and type ii string theories, that we will use in our subsequent analysis. the reader with less

string theoretical background may skip most of equations in this part with the exception

of the duality relations (8) and (18).

as is now well known, these three string theories are related by non-perturbative du-

alities, which take the simplest form in the n = 4 supersymmetric case of (e8  e8 or
so(32)) heterotic theory compactied on t 6, type ii on k3  t 2 and type i on t 6. we
will restrict our attention to this case, since it already exhibits the main features we want

to discuss. heterotictype i duality relates the two ten-dimensional string theories with

so(32) gauge group, upon identifying [22]

li = g1/2

h lh

gi =

1
gh

,

(8)

where li and lh denote the type i and heterotic string length. the heterotictype i duality

itself holds in lower dimensions as well, and does not aect the physical shape or size of

the compactication manifold.

the e8  e8 heterotic theory can in turn be perturbatively related to the so(32)
heterotic theory upon compactifying to nine dimensions on a circle, since a so(1, 17)

boost transforms the two even self-dual lattices into one another. more precisely, the two

theories are related by t-duality after breaking the gauge symmetry to so(16)  so(16)
4a similar conclusion was obtained by studying the ultraviolet behavior of the eective gauge theory

[21].

(9)

where the prime refers to the e8  e8 theory. on the type i side, t-duality maps the
theory with 32 d9-branes to a theory with 32 lower dp-branes, referred to in this work as

type i

p; the momentum states along the d9-branes are mapped to winding states in the

directions transverse to the dp-branes, and the action on the radii and coupling constant

is the standard t-duality relation r  l2

i /r, gi  gili/r.

on the other hand, heterotictype iia duality only arises in 6 dimensions or lower, and

identies again two theories with inverse six-dimensional couplings g6h = gh(l4

h/v4)1/2 and

g6iia = gii(l4

ii/vk3)1/2, with v4 and vk3 the volumes of t 4 and k3, respectively [26, 12]:

lii = g6iialh

g6iia =

1
g6h

.

(10)

the identication of the scalar elds other than the dilaton can be obtained by decomposing

the moduli space as

so(4, 20)

so(4)  so(20) (cid:20)r+ 

so(3, 19)

so(3)  so(19)(cid:21) .

(11)

on the heterotic side, this involves choosing a preferred direction of radius r1 in t 4,

parametrising the r+ factor, whereas on the type iia side, the two factors occur naturally

as the overall volume and complex structure of k3, respectively. the volume of k3 in type

iia units is thus related to the radius r1 in heterotic units as

lh(cid:19)2
(cid:18)r1

=

vk3
l4
ii

.

(12)

relating the other moduli elds requires a more precise understanding of the geometry of

k3 [24], but in the following we will be able to obtain a partial identication from the

m-theory point of view.

5this is in contrast to the unbroken so(32) or e8  e8 phase, where each theory is self-dual under

t-duality.

12

indeed, the above dualities can be understood in the m-theory description6, which

subsumes the heterotic and type ii descriptions at strong coupling. the type iia string

theory then appears as m-theory compactied on a vanishingly small circle of radius rs

given by

rs = giilii ,

l3
m = giil3

ii

(13)

where lm denotes the eleven-dimensional planck length [12, 27]; the e8e8 heterotic string
is obtained upon compactifying on a segment i of length ri given by analogous formulae:

ri = ghlh ,

l3
m = ghl3

h .

(14)

the two nine-branes at the end of the segment support the non-abelian gauge-elds,

whereas gravity propagates in the bulk [28]. in this framework, a double t-duality sym-
metry (r1, r2)  (l2

ii/r1) of type iia acts as [29, 25]

ii/r2, l2

(15)

where one of the radii i, j, k corresponds to the eleventh dimension; by eleven-dimensional

general covariance, this symmetry still holds for any choice of the three radii. as for the

heterotic t-duality r1  l2

h/r1, it translates into a symmetry

where ri denotes the radius of any circular dimension and ri the length of the (single)

as depicted in figure 1, we can now obtain the heterotictype itype ii relationships by

interpreting the compactication of m-theory on a manifold s1(r1)i(ri )t 3(r2, r3, r4)
in various ways. (i) considering i(ri) as the eleventh dimension simply gives the e8  e8
heterotic string on t 4(r1, r2, r3, r4) with string length and coupling given by eq. (14). (ii)

considering s1(r1) as the eleventh dimension gives type iia on i  t 3, or more properly
8 on i  t 3; (iii) by t-duality ti1 along the segment i, the theory (i) translates into
type i
heterotic so(32), whereas the theory (ii) turns into type i: it is straightforward to check

that these two are related by the duality relations (8) [28]. (iv) if we perform a t234 duality

on the torus t 3 before identifying s1(r1) with the eleventh dimension, we obtain a type
iia theory compactied on a four-dimensional manifold i(ri)  t 3( r2, r3, r4), which by
(i) is the same as the e8  e8 heterotic string on t 4(r1, r2, r3, r4). it is easy to check
that these two theories are related by the heterotictype ii duality relations (10,12). it is

therefore tempting to identify

where we recognize a triality transformation in the [so(4)  so(4)]\so(4, 4) subspace
of the moduli space. even though (17) is not a proper k3 surface (for one thing it is not

simply connected), it still is na bona de compactication manifold, albeit singular. indeed,

it has been argued that such a squashed shape arises in the decompactication limit of

the heterotic torus t 4 at the e8  e8 enhanced symmetry point [31]. this representation
of k3 will turn out to be very convenient in the discussion of large radius behaviour of

heterotic and type ii theories in the sequel.

4 large dimensions in heterotic string

here we consider the heterotic string compactied in four dimensions with a certain number

n of large internal dimensions. keeping the four-dimensional gauge coupling gym of order

unity, the heterotic theory is strongly coupled with a ten-dimensional string coupling and

four-dimensional planck length

gh = gym(cid:18) r

lh(cid:19)n/2

 1 ,

lp = gymlh

(20)

7 this mapping was independently obtained by polchinski as referred to in [30].

15

where r is the common radius of the large dimensions, while the remaining 6  n are
assumed to be of the order of the string length lh. for n < 6, the distinction between the

so(32) and e8  e8 heterotic theories is irrelevant, since a t-duality (9) along a heterotic-
size direction converts one into another; we will therefore omit this distinction until we

discuss the n = 6 case, where such a dualisation is no longer innocuous.

in order to obtain a perturbative description of this theory, we consider rst its type

i dual obtained through the relations (8). the physical radii of the internal manifold are

unaected by this duality. in particular, there are still 6  n dimensions of size lh, and n
of size r. we therefore have the following type i string length and coupling

n = 5, 6 :

in both cases, there are dimensions (6  n or 6 respectively) with size smaller than the
type i string length, which should be t-dualised in order to trade light winding modes for

kaluza-klein (kk) eld-theory states. in so doing, we move to a type i description where

the gauge interactions are localised on d-branes (extended in 3 + n or 3 spatial directions,

respectively). using the standard ( r = l2

i /r, gi = gili/r) t-duality relations, we obtain

the dual radii

where the t-dualised hatted radii correspond to transverse dimensions.

in the cases n = 1, 2, 3, type i theory is also strongly coupled, as seen from eqs. (24),

which is a consequence of the fact that the internal longitudinal directions of the d-branes

(of size r) are larger than the type i string length. in the cases n = 5, 6 however, the type

i theory does oer a perturbative description of the theory of interest, where the gauge

interactions are conned on d3-branes with large transverse dimensions of size r (n of
them) and lh (6  n of them). this is depicted in the following diagrams:

in particular, the so(32) heterotic string with n = 6 large dimensions, say at 108 gev, is

dual to a type i with string tension at the tev and six transverse dimensions at 0.1 fermi.

this is one of the examples that were treated recently in the context of tev strings [9].

the type i threshold appears in the strongly coupled heterotic theory below the kk scale

of 108 gev [32], which is then identied with the scale of the (superheavy) type i winding

states around the fermi-size transverse dimensions.

in the n = 4 case, two distinct type i perturbative descriptions are possible, due to

the proximity of the radius r of the four large dimensions with the type i string scale

li = g1/2

ymr. for gym < 1, it is sucient to t-dualise the two directions of size lh, resulting

in a d7-brane type i description with string coupling unity, which can be lowered by

increasing for instance the size of the two small dimensions slightly above the heterotic

length. for gym > 1 on the other hand, one should t-dualise also the remaining four

directions, resulting in a d3-brane type i description as above. in both cases, the type i

scale is close to the size of the four heterotic large dimensions, say at the tev scale. this

17

provides another example of type i tev strings [9]. the gauge interactions are conned on

d-branes transverse to two large dimensions of (sub)millimeter-size. the type i threshold

now appears at the same order as the kk scale (at the tev) [33], while the heterotic scale

 which is also the kk scale of the remaining two dimensions  is identied with the mass

of the type i winding modes around the two millimeter-size dimensions. this model is of

particular interest, because it oers a possibility to keep the apparent unication of gauge

couplings close to the heterotic scale, due to the logarithmic sensitivity of the gauge theory

on the brane with respect to the size of the two-dimensional transverse space [6, 3].

in order to obtain a perturbative description for the cases n = 1, 2, 3, we now consider

the type iia dual of the original heterotic theory. as described in section 3, the heterotic

type iia duality selects four preferred dimensions of radii r1,2,3,4 on the heterotic side,

while at the e8  e8 enhanced symmetry point the compactication manifold for the type
iia string takes the simplied form

k3  t 2 =hi(ri)  t 3( r2, r3, r4)i  t 2(r5, r6) .

(29)

the remaining two-torus of radii r5, r6 is common to both descriptions, which also have

the same four-dimensional gauge coupling and planck mass

as we mentioned in the previous sections, the four k3 directions corresponding to ri and

ri are transverse to the 5-brane where gauge interactions are localised.

in order to obtain a weakly coupled type ii description, we therefore need to carefully

arrange the choice of the n large dimensions on the heterotic side. for instance, in the n = 1

case, choosing r1 as the large radius results in a strongly coupled type ii theory with gii  r
in units of the heterotic string length; choosing r2 (or r3, r4) as the large dimensions

gives a type ii dual with moderate coupling gii  1/gym, but with radii r3, r4  1/r

much smaller than the string length; after t-dualisation along these directions, the theory

becomes strongly coupled. the last option is to take r5 (or r6) as the large radius, which

yields a weakly coupled type ii dual string with gii  1/gymr and lii  gymr; after

t-dualizing the heterotic-size direction r6, we obtain a weakly coupled type iib description

with hierarchy

where we denoted by r6 the radius of the t-dual sixth dimension. this is one of the models

discussed in section 2, with two radii at the tev and a string scale at intermediate energies

1011 gev.

in the n = 2 case, the same reasoning leads to choosing the radii r5, r6  r as the

large heterotic dimensions, and gives a weakly coupled type iia description

without need of t-dualizing any direction. this is the other type ii model discussed in

section 2, with string scale and all internal dimensions at the tev, and with an innitesimal

string coupling 1014 accounting for the largeness of the four-dimensional planck mass.

in the cases n = 3, 4, 5, 6, we choose the directions of radii r1, r5, r6  r as three of
the large heterotic dimensions, and for n > 3 also switch on n  3 large dimensions in the
heterotic t 3(r2, r3, r4) torus. the type ii dual has string length lii = gymr and coupling

gii = 1/gym, while the k3 manifold has size (in heterotic units):

except for the n = 5, where the existence of the small radius r4 implies strong coupling

after t-duality, all these cases correspond to a weakly coupled type ii dual. in the n = 3

case, the type ii dual provides a perturbative description of the heterotic theory that could

not be reached on the type i side:

this is the type ii model discussed in section 2 with string scale and two longitudinal

dimensions at the tev, and an isotropic k3 with 4 transverse directions at a fermi.

in the n = 4 case, the type ii dual theory provides a perturbative description, alternative

to the type i. the type ii dual string has the same scale hierarchy as the type i, up to

factors of gym:

these two models should provide equivalent perturbative descriptions of the same theory.

in the n = 6 case, we now obtain a weakly coupled description of the e8  e8 heterotic

(36)

due to the occurrence of gravitational kk states8 at the scale ri, the type ii string tension

as well as the heterotic compactication scale cannot be lower than 108 gev, corresponding

to the bound ri

<
 1 mm. this situation should be contrasted with the case of the so(32)

heterotic string with n = 6 large radii, which admits a perturbative description (26) as a

type i string with length li = g1/2

ymr3/2. the bound on r still applies, corresponding now

to a type i string scale at a tev, and six transverse dimensions at 0.1 fermi. note that the

dierence between the type i and type ii string scales does not lead to any inconsistency,

since the two perturbative descriptions are not simultaneously possible.

5 large dimensions in type ii theories and their duals

having discussed the large radius behaviour of the dual heterotic theory, we now reconsider

the type iia models we introduced in section 2, and discuss their dual descriptions. we

therefore consider type iia theory, compactied on the simplied model (29) of k3  t 2,
with a weak string coupling gii  1, two string-size directions r5, r6  lii and possibly 
8note that these excitations are not stable due to the lack of momentum conservation along the interval

i(ri ).

21

large transverse directions of size r  lii within k3. this theory is then identied to a
strongly coupled heterotic string compactied on t 6, with parameters simply obtained by

inverting eq. (18):

rj rk

, i, j, k = 2, 3, 4 .

(37a)

(37b)

while the torus t 2(r5, r6), common to both sides, is still at the type ii string scale.

in the  = 0 case, the dual heterotic string has a scale lh = gii in type ii units, of the

same order as the radii r1,2,3,4; r5,6 on the other hand still have a type ii string scale,

and are much larger (at weak type ii coupling) than the heterotic scale. this situation is

therefore identical to the heterotic n = 2 case in (33), which did not admit a perturbative

type i dual.

for   1, t-duality on the k3 manifold allows us to choose one of the large directions

as the interval of length ri = r  lii. we therefore consider a regime where

ri = r ,

r2 r3 r4 = r1 ,

r5 = r6 = lii ,

gii  1

(38)

in units of the type iia string length lii. the parameters for the dual heterotic string

therefore scale as

lh = giir/2 ,

gh =

2+

2

r
gii

,

r1 = gii ,

ri =

rj rk

.

(39)

a simple case by case study shows that the  = 1, 2, 4 cases are identical to the n = 6, 4, 3

heterotic cases, up to powers of gii which we now consider of order 1. the  = 3 case

on the other hand is new, since it involves, after t-duality along the direction r4, three
large directions of size r2,3,4  lh(r/lii)1/2, and three extra-large ones of size r1,5,6 
lh(r/lii)3/2. it does not yield, however, any perturbative description on the type i side.

again we see that the n = 5 heterotic case does not appear, since it corresponds to a

strongly coupled type ii theory.

22

we now turn to the type iib theory, again compactied on the model (29) of k3  t 2
for simplicity. since t-duality on one of the circles r5,6 identies the type iia and iib

theories, it is sucient to restrict our attention to the case where both circles are much

larger than the type ii string length, but still of comparable size in order to maintain a

small gauge coupling g2

ym = r5/r6. the type iib theory is then equivalent to a strongly

coupled heterotic theory with parameters

where now the l.h.s. refers to type iib variables. for  = 0, the dual heterotic theory

has one large dimension of radius r5 = r and ve heterotic-stringsize dimensions, up to

factors of giib  1, which corresponds to the situation in (32). for   1, we obtain again
a heterotic theory with more than two scales, and heterotictype i duality does not yield

any valuable perturbative description.

6 concluding remarks

in this paper, we studied new scenarios of tev strings or large dimensions in weakly coupled

type ii theories and related them by duality to heterotic string compactications with large

dimensions. in particular, we described a type iia theory with all compactication and

string scales at the tev, but with a tiny string coupling which explains the weakness

of gravitational interactions. we also described a type iib theory with two large non-

transverse dimensions at the tev and a fundamental string scale at 1011 gev. the main

features of our discussion are summarised in figure 2.

as a result, the heterotic string with n  4 large dimensions at the tev has a weakly
coupled description in terms of type ii or type i theory, as indicated in the table. when

figure 2: weakly coupled dual descriptions of heterotic string with n large dimensions or

radius rh . the two last columns list the size of the internal radii in the dual theory and

the scale at which string interactions and quantum gravity become relevant.

the number of large dimensions is n = 5 or 6, there is an upper bound for the compact-

ication scale because the string threshold of the weakly coupled dual theory appears in

lower energies [32]. the entries in the last three rows correspond to a saturation of this

bound. moreover, the case n = 5 is generally forbidden since the dual type i theory has an

anisotropic transverse space with one dimension very large compared to the others; this in-

validates the decoupling of the gauge theory on the brane unless local tadpole cancellation

is imposed [3].

in particular, we showed that the rst two simple type ii examples above describe the

heterotic string with one or two large tev dimensions. in fact, these are the only two cases

that have been previously considered seriously in the context of the heterotic theory before

knowing its strong coupling behavior [1, 15]. our analysis here showed that many of the

properties and predictions of the heterotic string for these two cases remain valid, despite

its strong ten-dimensional coupling. more precisely: (i) the existence of kk excitations for

all standard model gauge bosons in n = 4 supermultiplets, and their absence for quarks

24

and leptons; (ii) the absence of visible quantum gravity eects at the tev scale, above

which there is a genuine six-dimensional gauge theory, regulated by the underlying type

iia or iib theory; (iii) the possible relation of the tev dimensions with the mechanism

of supersymmetry breaking by the process of compactication. all soft breaking terms

can then be studied reliably in the eective eld theory due to the extreme softness of the

breaking above the compactication scale [8]; (iv) the possibility that the unication of low

energy gauge couplings remains at the experimentally inferred gut scale, which is much

higher than the fundamental string scale of the weakly coupled type ii theory.

many questions and open problems remain of course to be done. certainly, the possi-

bilities discussed here give new viable directions of how string theory may be possibly

connected with the description of our observed low energy world. we note however that

the strong coupling regime of the heterotic string is traded for a strong (singular) curvature

situation in the type ii framework, which is only partially accounted for in the geometric

engineering eld theory approach.
