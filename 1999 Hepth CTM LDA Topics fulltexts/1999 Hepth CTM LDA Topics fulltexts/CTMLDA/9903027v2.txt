abstract

we give a construction of o-shell tree bosonic string amplitudes, based on the

operatorial formalism of the n -string vertex, with three external massless states

both for open and closed strings by requiring their being projective invariant. in

particular our prescription leads, in the low-energy limit, to the three-gluon ampli-

tude in the usual covariant gauge.

one of the main reasons for studying o-shell string amplitudes is the investigation of
the eld theory limit of string theories where the inverse string tension   0 [1] [2]. a
detailed analysis of the relation between string theory and eld theory is non-trivial and

potentially very powerful since string theory manages to organize scattering amplitudes

in a very compact form and in a considerably low number of diagrams. in particular,

closed strings can be used to shed light on perturbative quantum gravity [3].

furthermore, o-shell string amplitudes are relevant in studying processes which in-

volve interactions among d-branes [4].

o-shell extensions of such amplitudes have been studied a great deal until now [1] [2]
[5]  [10] and dierent prescriptions have been given according to the pursued approaches.
in this letter we use the operatorial formalism of the n-string g-loop vertex vn ;g

[11] for computing tree open and closed string amplitudes with three external massless

states. this simple case results to be very clarifying about the prescription to use for the

analysis of o-shell string physics.

in the framework of the same formalism, in two recent papers [12] [13], o-shell

one-loop amplitudes with an arbitrary number of external massless particles have been

computed both for open and closed strings.

the n-string g-loop vertex vn ;g depends on which local holomorphic coordinate

system i is used around the puncture pi, i = 1, ..., n, through which the n-th external

state is inserted on the world-sheet. one can introduce a single holomorphic coordinate

z so that each local coordinate i can be expressed as

or

i = v 1

i

(z)

z = vi(z),

(1)

(2)

where vi(z) is a conformal transformation. since it is conventional to take i(pi) = 0,
it follows that zi  z(pi) = vi(0). the n quantities zi correspond to the so-called
koba-nielsen variables.

1

a choice of a local coordinate system around the puncture pi can be regarded as a

sort of a gauge choice. when vn ;g is saturated with n physical string states satisfying

the mass-shell conditions, the corresponding amplitude does not depend on the vis. if

these conditions are released, then the dependence of vn ;g on them is transferred to the

o-shell amplitude. this is analogous to what happens in gauge theories, where on-shell

amplitudes are gauge invariant, while their o-shell counterparts are not.

from the gauge choice made for the local maps it depends the eld theory gauge-xed

lagrangian which generates the amplitudes to be compared with the string theory ones

in the low-energy limit. in fact one does not know a priori what gauge-xing is chosen

by the string when the eld theory limit is extracted from its amplitudes.

the results obtained in ref.

[2] in the one-loop case show that it is possible to per-

form choices of vi which, in the case of open bosonic strings, reproduce the eld theory

amplitudes obtained by using the background gauge.

hence it arises the necessity to dene the assumptions underlying the choice of the

functions vis.

the basic assumption we make in this work is that o-shell amplitudes have to be

projective invariant; indeed projective invariance, or mobius invariance, is a crucial prop-

erty if o-shell niteness and factorization are required [14]. the choice of local maps

around the punctures has therefore to guarantee this invariance.

in the specic case of the amplitude for three massless states it turns out that, in

the limit   0, it depends on the choice of vi only through the ratio v 
requiring its being projective invariant in this limit allows to select a set of functions of

i (0)/(v 

i (0))2.

koba-nielsen variables (z1, z2, z3) depending on one parameter. the value of this latter

can be xed by requiring that the sum over all the anticyclic permutations of the lowest

order term in , providing the eld theory tree scattering amplitudes for photons, be

identically zero. in this way we univocally determine the ratio v 

i (0)/(v 

i (0))2.

furthermore, requiring that the complete amplitude, and not only its low-energy

limit, be projective invariant univocally xes v 

i (0) that turns out to coincide with the

rst derivative evaluated at z = 0 of the projective transformation which maps the

2

points , 0, 1 respectively in zi1, zi, zi+1 and which corresponds to the so-called lovelace
choice [15]. but we would like here to stress that the lovelace choice does not reproduce

the value of v 

i (0)/(v 

i (0))2 compatible with our requirement of projective invariance.

it is possible to show that the value of v 

i (0) so found is the one that makes the tree

level string green function to reduce to a particle green function in the eld theory limit

[16].

the above prescription yields an expression of the o-shell three-gluon string ampli-

tude, at tree level, which reproduces the corresponding one in eld theory in the most

natural gauge, i.e. the usual covariant gauge, and also coincides with the one obtained

by the background eld method that is the technique in which results concerning higher

orders are obtained in literature [2] [17].

furthermore, the normalization constant c0 is given by 43/k2, where k is the grav-

in order to get o-shell scattering amplitudes among n massless external particles,

we have to saturate v c

with gd being the gauge coupling constant of the target space yang-mills theory, and to

release the on-shell conditions, i.e.:

p2 = 0

  p = 0.

(9)

at tree level, the n-string vertex does not contain any operator that mixes the left and

right sectors of the closed bosonic string, which implies that a tree closed string amplitude

can be simply factorized into two tree open string amplitudes [18]. hence, in restricting

ourselves to compute v c

3 , we consider one sector of the operator given in eq. (4) and

write it properly for n = 3 in the case of open bosonic strings. we get:

we would like here to observe that in the three-string case the integration is absolutely
ctitious. indeed, through the identication za = z1, zb = z2, zc = z3, the measure [dm]0

merely reduces to:

(12)

we do not want now to perform any explicit choice of the local holomorc coordi-

nate vi(z), our purpose being to get some constraints on this function by requiring the

projective invariance of the amplitude. indeed, by saturating the operator (10) on three

states as the ones dened in (8), without specifying any choice of the local holomorphic

function, we get:

where  is a free parameter. then there exist, as solutions, a set of functions of the

koba-nielsen variables parametrized by . in order to choose a value for that parameter,

we impose our low-energy amplitude to reproduce a gauge independent result such as

the one relative to the three-photon scattering amplitude which is identically zero. for

extracting this amplitude we sum the expression (14) over all the anticyclic permutations

of the indices (1, 2, 3) getting:

it is easy to check that the lovelace function does not satisfy the equation (18). by

(20)

if this latter amplitude has to be projective invariant, then vi(z) must satisfy the following

i = const.

(21)

from (18) we know that v 

i (0) must be a function of all the punctures, then we can

conjecture it to be written as follows:

i (0) = (zi  zi+1)a (zi  zi1)b (zi+1  zi1)c
v 

(22)

where a, b, c, are unknown exponents to be determined by resolving the eq. (21). indeed,

by inserting (22) into (21) we get the following system equations for a, b, c:

1a + p2
p2
3a + p2
p2

2a + p2

2b + p2
1b + p2
3b + p2

3c = 2p1  p2
2c = 2p1  p3
1c = 2p3  p2.




this system admits a unique solution that, using the momentum conservation, is:

plugging it into (22) yields:

a = 1

b = 1
c = 1.




v 

i (0) =

(zi  zi+1)(zi  zi1)

(zi+1  zi1)

.

(23)

(24)

(25)

it implies that all the tree green functions involved in the three-string case and dened

by eq.

(11) vanish. the eq.

(25) corresponds to the rst derivative of the lovelace

function vi(z) evaluated at z = 0 [15].

7

by requiring, then, the projective invariance of the low-energy limit of the amplitude

(14) and it to reproduce the three-photon scattering amplitude, we could x the ratio

i (0))2; at the same time, by requiring the projective invariance of the scattering

v 
i (0)/(v 
amplitude (14) we get a specic prescription for the function v 

i (0). if the local holo-

morphic coordinate system vi(z) is chosen to be a projective transformation satisfying

by construction the condition vi(0) = zi, we completely x the function vi(z) by xing

v 
i (0) and v 

i (0)/(v 

i (0))2.

introducing the choices (25) and (18) in (20) gives the following projective invariant

(26)

let us now come back to the analysis of the eld theory limit of the open string

amplitude. we are interested in the evaluation of the three-gluon scattering amplitude.

as it is well-known, at tree level we need to sum the expression in (19) over all the

anticyclic permutations of the indices (1, 2, 3) after having multiplied it by the chan-

paton factor

tr (a1 a2 a3) .

(27)

in this object s are the generators of the su(n) gauge group in the fundamental

representation. through the normalization conditions

tr (a b) =

1
2

ab

the chan-paton factor can be rewritten as:

tr (a1 a2 a3) =

1
4

(f a1a2a3 + da1a2a3) ,

(28)

(29)

where f is an antisymmetric tensor with respect the internal indices ai and d a symmetric

one. an explicit evaluation of the three-gluon amplitude yields:

a3

0(gluons) = gd (1)

this expression coincides with the one of the three-gluon scattering amplitude obtained

through a covariant quantization of a non abelian gauge theory with gauge group su(n)

or by using the background eld method.

in computing a string amplitude in our formalism, the choice of the function vi(z)

seems to be strictly connected with the gauge choice in the eld theory limit of those

amplitudes. since the request of consistency, like that we have here made, together with

the conjecture (22), completely xes vi(z), it turns out that the only way in which the

open string can reproduce the eld theory gauge-dependent result of the three-gluon

scattering amplitude at tree level is in the usual covariant gauge [2].

let us analyze the closed string case, by extending to it the result in (19). we nd

that the scattering amplitude involving three external o-shell massless states admits the

following low-energy limit:

0 (  0) = k (1)

although the de donder gauge is commonly believed to be the preferred gauge choice

in quantum gravity [19], there are some arguments [20] which suggest that it is not the

one chosen by the bosonic closed string.

we have investigated this point by computing the expansion of the einstein-hilbert

lagrangian coupled to a dilaton eld with the de donder gauge xing term, up to the

third order in the elds. on the complete lagrangian we have performed the following

transformations [3]:

h = h +
 = s d  2

2

d  2
1
2

 +



h
.

(34)

(35)

these have been determined by requiring that the propagator for h generated by

the transformed lagrangian were proportional to the unit tensor given in (33), that has

a trivial lorentz structure compatibly with the form of the string propagator which does

not contain any lorentz indices [3]. then the computation of the three-point function

from the lagrangian so obtained has not reproduced the result shown in (32).

this means that, within this comprehension of decoupling gravitons and dilatons, and

in agreement with the arguments of ref.

[20], the closed string does not choose, in the

low-energy limit, the de donder gauge, which, naively, might be considered as the most

natural counterpart of the usual covariant gauge in the open string case.
