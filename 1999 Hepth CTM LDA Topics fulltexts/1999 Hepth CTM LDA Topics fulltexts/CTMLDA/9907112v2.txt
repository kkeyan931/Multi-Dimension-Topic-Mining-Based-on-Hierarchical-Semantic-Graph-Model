abstract

we study in detail the pattern of anomaly cancellation in d = 6 type iib
zn orientifolds, occurring through a generalized green-schwarz mechanism
involving several rr antisymmetric tensors and scalars elds. the starting
point is a direct string theory computation of the inow of anomaly arising from
magnetic interaction of d-branes, o-planes and xed-points, which are encoded
in topological one-loop partition functions in the rr odd spin-structure. all
the rr anomalous couplings of these objects are then obtained by factorization.
they are responsible for a spontaneous breaking of u (1) factors through a higgs
mechanism involving the corresponding hypermultiplets. some of them are
also related by supersymmetry to gauge couplings involving the nsns scalars
sitting in the tensor multiplets. we also comment on the possible occurrence
of tensionless strings when these couplings diverge.

1. introduction

anomalies have proven to play a prominent role in the study of non-trivial vacua
of string theory. their cancellation constitute a very severe constraint on the low-
energy quantum eld theory, which can be usually understood in string theory as
consequence of basic consistency requirements, like modular invariance and tadpole
cancellation. a very interesting peculiarity of low-energy eective quantum eld the-
ories emerging from string theory is the occurrence of anomalies in certain tree-level
magnetic interaction mediated by p-form gauge elds, beside the well known anoma-
lies arising in one-loop amplitudes involving chiral fermions or self-dual bosons. this
allows for consistent quantum elds theories with a non-vanishing one-loop anomaly
cancelled by an equal and opposite tree-level anomaly. this is of course the celebrated
green-schwarz mechanism [1].

thanks to the important recent developments in string theory, this cancellation
mechanism can be understood as a particular example of the so-called inow mech-
anism [2]. given a consistent anomaly free theory, there can exist vacua with topo-
logical defects supporting anomalous zero modes. the latter will be responsible for a
local violation of charge conservation on the defects, which has to be compensated by
an inow of charge from outside the defects induced by appropriate couplings of the
defects to the elds living in the bulk. in string theory, this kind of non-perturbative
objects do indeed arise in non-trivial vacua, important examples being d-branes and
o-planes [3]. both of these kind of objects support anomalous elds on their world-
volumes, and have thus to have appropriate anomalous couplings to bulk elds for
consistency. indeed, they present topological wess-zumino couplings to rr p-forms
which are precisely those required to cancel through the inow mechanism all the
one-loop anomalies on their world-volumes [4, 5, 6]. the eective appearance of all
of these couplings in string theory has been deduced in a unied way in [7] by fac-
torizing rr magnetic interactions between d-branes and o-planes with non trivial
curvatures, encoded in annulus, mobius strip and klein bottle amplitudes. they have
also been checked in successive steps through direct computations of the induced rr
charges, encoded in disk and crosscap amplitudes [8, 9, 10, 11]. some terms have
also been derived through duality [12, 13, 14]. in orientifold models [15, 16, 17, 18],
the situation is particularly clear. the d-branes associated to chan-paton degrees
of freedom, as well as the xed-planes of the orientifold group action like o-planes,
support in general anomalous elds giving rise to a non-vanishing anomaly, but also
appropriate wess-zumino couplings to rr elds inducing a net inow of anomaly.
for consistent models, these one-loop and tree-level anomalies always cancel; this is
usually a direct consequence of the more basic consistency requirement of tadpole
cancellation.

in this paper, we study in detail anomaly cancellation in type iib zn orientifolds
in d = 6 dimensions [16, 19, 20, 21, 22]. these models are particularly interesting

2

because of their rich and peculiar spectrum, which diers from what expected [23]
for a smooth type iib orientifold on k3, which is equivalent to type i on k3 as
a consequence of the well known fact that type i strings can be understood as the
simplest orientifold of type iib strings [15].
in particular, a variable number of
extra tensor multiplets arise in addition to the universal one expected in the smooth
case [19]. anomaly cancellation imposes extremely powerful constraints on these
theories, like on every n = (1, 0) supersymmetric chiral theory in d = 6, due to
the potential presence of both gauge and gravitational anomalies [24]. in general, a
generalization of the green-schwarz mechanism involving all the rr elds present
in the model occurs [25]. in [6], a systematic way of studying anomaly cancellation
in orientifold models was sketched, and applied to the simple case of the z2 model,
investigated in great detail in [26], in which no extra tensor multiplets arise1. this
work is devoted to a detailed analysis of all the zn models, with particular emphasis
on the inow interpretation, for the case of maximal unbroken gauge group. we
will proceed with a renement of the philosophy used in [7, 6], consisting in a direct
string computation of the inow of anomaly arising from magnetic interaction among
d-branes, o-planes and xed-points. all the anomalous couplings in each model
can then be easily obtained by factorization. due to supersymmetry, these give an
important information on other terms of the low-energy eective action, in particular
to the form of the gauge couplings 1/g2 present in the theory [25].
interestingly,
there are special points in the moduli space of the tensor multiplet scalars where 1/g2
vanishes or becomes negative [25]; tensionless strings appear then in the spectrum
and the theory may undergo a phase transition [28, 29, 30]. the orientifold models
discussed here correspond to particular points in the moduli space parametrized by
these scalars, where all the gauge couplings are positive denite and nite. however,
from some coecients appearing in the anomaly polynomial and by supersymmetry,
one can nd the dependence of the gauge couplings on these moduli. we nd points
where these are vanishing and no simple string description is available. one can
also x the couplings between these scalars and the gauge elds. the results are
in agreement with what found in [31], where such couplings were computed for the
d9-brane gauge group by factorizing one-loop cp-even amplitudes2.

analogously to what has been shown for the z2 orientifold in [26], anomaly can-
cellation involves also the exchange of scalar elds and their dual four-forms. this
results in the breaking of some (but in general not all, even in the case of maximal
gauge symmetry discussed here) of the u(1) gauge factors present in the gauge group.
this paper is organized as follows. in section two, we explain the strategy used
to compute the inow of anomaly through one-loop computations in the rr odd
spin-structure. in section three, we apply the general results obtained in section two

to the zn orientifolds. in section four, we nd the anomalous couplings of d-branes,
o-planes and xed-points by factorization, and in section ve we study explicitly
the factorization of the anomaly for each model.
in section six, we analyze the
form of some terms in the low-energy eective action of these models, related by
supersymmetry to the anomalous couplings found previously, and the spontaneous
breaking of some u(1) factors of the gauge group. finally, in last section, we give
some conclusions and in the two appendices we respectively recall useful formulae
about the inow mechanism and report the explicit form of the anomalous couplings
for each model.

2. inow and anomalies in string theory

one-loop anomalies in quantum eld theory as well as in string theory can be
computed by evaluating one-loop diagrams with suitable external particles (gravitons
and gauge elds for the case of gravitational and gauge anomalies), one of which
polarized longitudinally. consistent string theories are known to be anomaly-free. at
the level of their low-energy eective actions, the total one-loop anomaly need not to
vanish, but can cancel against anomalies due to particular couplings between gauge
particles and rr elds. the crucial feature of these actions is that these couplings
do actually appear and precisely in the appropriate form to give an anomaly free
quantum eld theory. one could be satised by this statement and conclude that
such couplings can be derived by requiring the tree-level anomaly they produce to
be equal and opposite to the one-loop anomaly produced by the chiral elds present
in the model. such point of view is however unsatisfactory for at least two reasons.
first, it is indirect and always relies on the assumption (generically taken to be
valid) that consistent string theories are anomaly free. most importantly, it does not
allow for a microscopic analysis of the origin of such couplings in string theory. this
second reason is crucial for our purposes of computing anomalous couplings in iib
orientifolds. it is expected, for instance, that in such models several tensor and hyper
multiplets, coming from dierent twisted closed string sectors, play a decisive role in
the inow mechanism. whereas a string derivation of these couplings allows a total
understanding of their origin and the role they play in the various inows, an analysis
at the level of the low-energy eective action only, would be necessarily incomplete.
the question is then how to compute such anomalous couplings (or the correspond-
ing inows) in string theory, and more precisely in generic type iib orientifolds. the
most direct approach would be to perform a disk or crosscap computation with the
insertion of gauge elds, gravitons and the rr eld in question. the advantage of
this approach is that it yields directly the couplings. however, the precise form of the
vertex operators of the various tensor elds is needed, including those arising from
the closed string twisted sectors, and it is quite awkward and hard to x correctly the
normalizations. on the other hand, one can compute appropriate amplitudes from

4

which such couplings can be extracted by factorization. the most convenient choice
turns out to be a generic one-loop correlation function in the odd spin-structure with
external gravitons and gauge elds, one of which polarized longitudinally. these am-
plitudes on the annulus, mobius strip and klein bottle can indeed be factorized as
a tree-level exchange of closed strings between two disk or crosscap sources. as we
shall argue in the following, this amounts to compute directly the anomalous inows
induced by these couplings.

before entering into the details of the computation, we would like to do some
remarks and anticipate some results. the correlation functions above will turn out
to be a total derivative in the moduli space of the various relevant surfaces: annulus,
mobius strip and klein bottle. as well known, these surfaces have two equivalent
interpretations, either as one-loop amplitudes of open (for the annulus and mobius
strip) or closed (for the klein bottle) strings, or as tree-level closed string amplitudes.
correspondingly, the modular parameter of these surfaces can be taken either as the
proper time t in the loop channel or the proper time l  1/t in the tree channel. the
inow due to massless rr elds will arise from the ir region l   of the tree-
channel, corresponding to the uv region t  0 of the loop channel, where indeed
usual anomalies can arise.

due to the topological nature of the amplitudes in question, the computation
always reduces to the simple evaluation of the partition function of a supersymmetric
quantum mechanical model. from now on, we will concentrate for simplicity on the
case of six non-compact dimensions, since this is the case we are interested in. more
general cases can be treated similarly without additional diculties, the elds along
the compact directions entering always through their odd spin-structure partition
function. we are then interested to compute a given four-point function of gluons
and/or gravitons in the odd spin-structure, with one of them polarized longitudinally.
the unphysical particle represents essentially a gauge transformation, and choosing it
to be a gluon or a graviton corresponds to compute gauge and gravitational anomalous
variations respectively.

in the odd spin-structure, the genus one world-sheets we are considering admit
independently of the boundary conditions, the integration
a gravitino zero mode.
over the latter in the polyakov path-integral results in the insertion of the sum of the
left and right moving world-sheet supercurrents, tf + tf . moreover, since the total
superghost charge is 1, one has to take one vertex operator in the (1)-picture and
all the others in the (0)-picture. a non-vanishing result is obtained by taking the
vertex of the unphysical particle to be in the (1)-picture and all the vertices of the
physical particles in the (0)-picture. we have then to compute
v unphy. (tf + tf ) i .

c = h v phy.

in the following, we will use the same strategy as in the introduction of [32]. for
simplicity, we will systematically omit the ghost and superghost dependence of all

5

the operators, since their contributions to the correlation functions we will compute
always cancel by supersymmetry.

the vertex operators in the (0)-picture for physical gluons and gravitons, with

transverse polarizations a

g =  z d2z (x  + ip  )(cid:16) x  + ip   (cid:17) eipx .

(2.2)

(2.3)

the vertex operators in the (1)-picture for unphysical gluons and gravitons, with
longitudinal polarizations a
 = p a and  = p(), are not total derivatives as
they would be in the (0)-picture. however, they can be written as the world-sheet
supersymmetry variations

v unphy. = [q + q, v unphy.]

are the left and right-moving world-sheet supercharges.

we can now use standard manipulations as in [33] and reverse the contour in-
tegration for q and q3. since all the other vertex operators in the correlation are
supersymmetric, the only non-vanishing term arises when q + q hits the picture
changing vertex operator tf + tf , giving

[q + q, tf + tf ] = tb + tb ,

(2.7)

where tb + tb is the world-sheet energy-momentum tensor. we are then left with

(2.8)

the insertion of the energy-momentum tensor in a correlation function corre-
sponds generically to take a teichmuller deformation of the remaining amplitude; in
our case, this means basically to take a derivative with respect to the modulus t. by
a careful treatment of the path-integral measure, it has been shown that this is in-
deed precisely what happens for the six-gluon correlation function giving the hexagon
gauge anomaly in type i string theory [34]. it is not dicult to convince oneself that

3in the case at hand, these manipulations have to be taken on the covering torus of each surface.

the same analysis can be carried out in the present case without any major change,

(2.9)

this is indeed in agreement with the expectation that space-time anomalies in string
theory arise as boundary terms in the moduli space of the various involved surfaces
[33]. this limit involves also the position of the graviton vertices. a potential anomaly
can arise only when all gravitons approach the same world-sheet boundary where all
the gauge elds sit or, for pure gravitational anomalies, when the four gravitons are
on the same boundary or crosscap [35]. these are the only kinematical congurations
in which, along the whole one-loop surface, there is no ow of momentum q in the
tree-level channel leading to an exponential suppression of the amplitude like eq2/t.
this is nothing but a generalization of the argument used to show that non-planar
diagrams, in the hexagon gauge anomaly of type i, are anomaly-free (see e.g. [36]).
the boundary value we are interested in is t  0, that is l  , where the amplitude
is dominated by the exchange of massless closed string states. the limit t  
corresponds instead to the ir part of the loop channel.

the full evaluation of (2.9), in particular when more gravitons are present, requires
still a considerable amount of work. however, it is not our aim to perform such a
calculation, that in a consistent string model has to give necessarily a vanishing
result4. rather, we are interested to extract from (2.9) the various anomalous inows
coming from the exchange of rr elds.
in order to do that, we can restrict the
evaluation of (2.9) to the lowest order in the external momenta p. indeed, in quantum
eld theory, any momentum dependence in an anomalous variation of the eective
action can be removed by adding suitable local counter terms5. this is not possible
in string theory, where the full anomalous variation presents indeed a dependence
on the external momenta, dependence that turns out to be crucial to get a total
vanishing result. by neglecting this dependence we will then be able to extract a
nite and non-vanishing result corresponding to the inow terms. notice that in this
approximation the amplitude (2.9) is t-independent.

recall now that the odd spin-structure one-loop correlation function above in-
volves an integration over the six bosonic zero modes x
0 , corresponding to the integral
over six-dimensional space-time, as well as an integration over the six fermionic zero
modes 
0 , which is vanishing unless all of them are inserted. notice that none of
the unphysical vertices (2.5) and (2.6) contains fermionic zero modes, so that all of
them must be provided by the physical vertices v phy.. as discussed in [7], the gluon

4see for example [35], where the mixed and gravitational anomalies are computed in type i string

theory, using the covariant operatorial formalism, and are shown to vanish.

eective form at leading order in the momentum p is

(2.10)

interestingly enough, the unphysical gluon and graviton vertex operators reduce, at
leading order in the momentum p, to eective vertices of exactly the same kind,
but with unphysical longitudinal curvatures f a = a and r = p[] which do not
depend on the fermionic zero modes.

since all the eective vertices are now at most quadratic in the elds, it is con-
venient to exponentiate them adding the corresponding interaction to the free world-
sheet action. the net eect of the unphysical vertex is to shift the corresponding
curvature as f a  f a + a if it is a gluon, or r  r + d[] if it is a gravi-
ton. the integral over the six fermionic zero modes automatically selects the correct
number (three) of physical vertices or, in language of forms, the six-form polynomial
to be integrated over the six-dimensional space-time we are considering. however, in
order to get a single unphysical vertex, one has to take the functional derivative with
respect to the parameter a or , and then set the parameter to zero. a striking
similitude then emerges with fujikawas method of computing anomalies, as in [24].
the unphysical vertex plays the role of the anomalous variation of the path-integral
measure, and implement essentially the descent operation i = di (0), i (0) = di (1),
on an auxiliary eight-form anomaly polynomial i, as required by the wess-zumino
consistency condition.

interestingly, one can at this point forget about the descent parameter  asso-
ciated to the unphysical vertex, keeping in mind that its net eect is to implement
the descent procedure, and compute directly the anomaly polynomial i rather than
the anomaly a itself. to achieve this out of the remaining correlation, one restricts
by hand to the eight-form instead of integrating over the six fermionic zero modes
which would select the six-form, and omits also the integral over the six bosonic zero
modes. we have therefore reduced the computation of the anomaly to the evaluation
of a supersymmetric partition function in the odd spin-structure in presence of an
arbitrary gravitational and gauge background. world-sheet supersymmetry further
implies that this is an index [37] which is independent of the modulus t, receiving
contribution only from zero energy states of the two-dimensional -model. the com-
putation, as anticipated, reduces then to the evaluation of the partition function of a
supersymmetric quantum mechanical model. the compact space plays a central role
in determining the precise normalization factors of the polynomial; moreover, in the

8

cases we will consider in which it is realized as an orbifold, it will induce additionally
twists in the chan-paton degrees of freedom [20].

the most important outcome of the above reasoning is a simple and general pre-
scription for the direct string theory computation of the anomaly inow in arbitrary
models, and in particular type iib orientifolds. by factorizing the annulus, mobius
strip and klein bottle inows, one can then deduce the anomalous couplings of all the
d-branes, o-planes and xed-points in the model. in general, such couplings involve
several rr elds arising in all the twisted sectors, and a generalized inow mecha-
nism takes places. correspondingly, the anomaly polynomial does not factorize, but
rather splits into a sum of factorized contributions corresponding to a plethora of
sub-inows.

3. inow for k3 orientifolds

in this section, we shall apply the tools derived in the previous section to the
d = 6 type iib zn orientifolds of [20, 21, 22]. in these models, tadpole cancellation
requires in general both d9-branes and d5-branes, and xes their number. in the
following, we shall restrict to the special points in the moduli space in which the
models have maximal gauge symmetry. this implies in particular that all the d5-
branes sit at the xed-point at the origin of the orbifold. for all the details about
these models, we refer to [21].

in this paper, we will focus on the type a zn orientifolds, in the terminology of
[21]. the d = 6 spectrum consist of gravitational, tensor, hyper and vector multiplets
of n = (1, 0) supersymmetry. the untwisted closed string sector yields the minimal
combination of 1 gravitational, 1 tensor and 2 hyper multiplets for all n 6= 2. for
n = 2 we get 1 gravitational, 1 tensor and 4 hyper multiplets. the twisted closed
string sector gives a varying number of neutral hyper multiplets and additional tensor
multiplets. these closed string spectra are summarized below.

as a consequence of the fact that the total number of neutral hyper and tensor
multiplets is always 21, there are just enough neutral anti-chiral spinors to combine
with the chiral gravitino to give the same gravitational anomaly as 8 self-dual tensors,

9

as follows from the six-dimensional anomaly cancellation relation

as a result, the total anomaly from neutral closed string states is

where nt is the number of tensor multiplets in the model. this anomaly is expected to
be canceled by the inow associated to the xed-plane-xed-plane interaction encoded
in the klein bottle amplitude.

in the open string sectors, one has vector multiplets as well as charged hyper
multiplets in various antisymmetric or bi-fundamental representations, as shown in
the following table.

in computing the anomalies produced by these elds, it is convenient to decompose all
the representations as tensor products of two fundamental representations (associated
to the end-points of open strings). correspondingly, the chern classes appearing in
the anomaly decompose as products of traces in the fundamental representation. we
shall indicate the latter with c(f ) in the following; more precisely, for the groups
u(n) and so(n) that appear we dene

c(f ) = chn(f ) = trn[eif/2] .

10

using these relations, the total gauge and gravitational anomalies produced by the
charged open string states in the various sectors can be easily computed. the anomaly
polynomials for all the models are reported in the table below.

we have used the fact that in six dimensions only terms with an even number of
curvatures can appear. for later convenience, we do not expand explicitly the anomaly
polynomials, but it is understood that only the 8-form component of the quoted
expressions is relevant. the latin letters a,b,c,... label the gauge group factors in the
same order as they appear in the previous table. the terms in the square brackets
with index 99, 55 and 95 are expected to be canceled by inows associated to the
d-brane-d-brane interaction encoded in the annulus amplitude in the 99, 55 and 95
sectors. similarly, the terms in the square brackets with index 9 and 5 are expected to
be canceled by the inows associated to the d-brane-xed-planes interaction encoded
in the mobius strip amplitude in the 9 and 5 sectors.

both d-branes (b) and xed-points (f) are involved in the inow mechanism. the
annulus, mobius strip and klein bottle amplitudes in the odd spin-structure encode
the anomaly inow arising from the rr magnetic interaction between two d-branes
(bb), a d-brane and a xed-point (bf), and two xed-points (ff) respectively. since
there are three types of interaction among only two kinds of objects, the factorization
of these interactions is non-trivial. the total inow induced by each surface is ob-
tained by summing over all the sectors of the orientifold group the partition function
of a quantum mechanical model in the (six-dimensional) odd spin-structure.

in the operatorial formalism, the relevant odd spin-structure amplitudes that we
have to compute on the annulus, mobius strip and klein bottle, are given by the
following partition functions:

za =

trr [ gk (1)f eth(r,f )] ,
n 1xm=0

rr [ gk (1)f + f eth(r,f )] ,
tr(m)

(3.5)

where a sum over chan-paton indices is understood for the case of the annulus and
mobius strip surfaces.
in the klein bottle amplitude, the extra sum includes all
the closed string twisted sectors. the overall factors come form the  and gso
projections. in the following we will not present the details of the evaluation of the
partition functions of the quantum mechanical models that are reported in [6, 7].

annulus
consider rst the various annulus amplitudes. the 99 contribution reads:

z 99

a (r, f9) =

1
4n

n 1xk=1

where the chern class

nk z b

k z f

k ch2(k f9) ba(r) ,

ch(k f9)  tr [k,9 eif9/2]

12

(3.6)

(3.7)

is dened in the chan-paton representation (which is built out of fundamental rep-
resentations of the various factors of the gauge group) and includes the matrix repre-
sentation k,9 of the twist gk induced by the orientifold group action in the 9 sector.

k

ba(r) is the roof genus, and is unaected by the orientifold projection. finally, nk and

z b,f
take into account the internal partition functions of the four compact bosons
and fermions, which in the 99 sector have an integer mode expansion and admit zero-
energy states. the bosons have zero modes xi
0 in each k-twisted sector, and
one has therefore to sum over all the k-xed-points fk, whose number is given by

0  gk xi

nk = 2 sin

k

n !4

, k = 1, . . . , n  1 .

(3.8)

the fermions have instead zero modes only in the untwisted sector k = 0, leaving
a vanishing partition function in this sector. finally, z b,f
represent the partition
functions in the k-twisted sector of the remaining uctuations of the four internal
bosons and fermions respectively, and are given by

k

k = 2 sin

z b

k

n !4

, z f

k = 2 sin

k

n !2

, k = 1, ..., n  1 .

(3.9)

in the 55 sector the dirichlet boundary conditions still allow zero-energy states for
fermions but not for bosons. the corresponding contribution is then:

where now

z 55

a (r, f5) =

1
4n

n 1xk=1

z f

k ch2(k f5) ba(r) ,

ch(k f5)  tr [k,5 eif5/2] .

(3.10)

(3.11)

finally, in the 95 sector the internal elds satisfy mixed neumann-dirichlet boundary
conditions and have a half-integer mode expansion. this implies that no zero-energy
states are present in these sectors and correspondingly

z 95
a (r, f9, f5) = 

1
2n

n 1xk=0

ch(k f9) ch(k f5) ba(r) .

(3.12)

the minus sign in (3.12) is due to the fact that the 95 ramond vacuum diers
by one unit of fermionic charge with respect to the 99 and 55 ramond vacua, and
the factor two takes into account the two orientations 95 and 59. from the closed
string channel point of view, these expressions encode the d9-d9, d5-d5 and d5-d9
magnetic interactions. the k-th term in each sum corresponds to the exchange of rr
forms of the k-th twisted sector.

mobius strip
the mobius strip contribution in the 9 sector reads

i 9
m (r, f9) = 

1
4n

n 1xk=1

nk z b

k z f

k ch(1

k t

k 2f9) ba(r) ,

(3.13)

13

where again we have taken into account the twist induced by the orientifold group
action on the chern class. the factor two entering in the chern character is due to
the fact that the boundary of the mobius strip is twice longer than one of the two
boundaries of the annulus. the analysis for the four internal directions is identical to
that presented for the 99 sector of the annulus and the corresponding contribution is
identical and given by (3.9). in the 5 sector we get instead

i 5
m (r, f5) = 

1
4n

n 1xk=0

z f

k+n/2 ch(1

k t

k 2f5) ba(r) ,

(3.14)

where again the four fermions present zero-energy states, absent for the bosons. the
extra n/2-twist is needed to implement dirichlet boundary conditions in the mobius
strip.

in the closed string channel, these expressions correspond to the d9-fk and d5-
fk magnetic interactions. the k-th term in each sum involves k-xed-points and
corresponds to the exchange of rr forms in the 2k-th twisted sector. correspondingly,
the following relations hold (see [21])

ch(1

k t

k 2f ) = ch(2k 2f ) ,

(3.15)

the + and  signs holding in the 9 and 5 sectors respectively.
klein bottle
in the closed string sector,  exchanges the m-th twisted sector with the (n  m)-
th6. this implies that the only sectors which contributes to the klein bottle partition
function in (3.5) are the untwisted sector m = 0 and, for n even, the middle sector
m = n/2. we then get two distinct contributions. the one coming from the untwisted
m = 0 sector is given by:

ik(r) =

1

16n

n 1xk=1

nk+n/2 z b

k+n/2 z f

k z f

(3.16)

k+n/2 bl(r) ,

where we have taken into account that in this sector, both the internal bosons and
and fermions have zero-energy states and that, analogously to the mobius strip case
in the 5 sector, an extra n/2-twist is needed to implement the correct crosscap condi-
tions. moreover, in this surface left-moving and right-moving fermions are not simply
identied but split into two combinations with periodic and anti-periodic zero-energy
states respectively [6]. this explains the various factors entering in (3.16).

in the n/2-twisted sector, the only zero-energy states are the bosonic zero modes

xi

0. since in (3.5) we have also a sum over all the gk-twists we get:

i 
k(r) =

k represents the number of n/2-xed-points that are also k-xed. these

n/2 = 16, and n 

k = n 

n k with

n 
k = min{nk, nk+n/2} , k = 1, ..., n/2  1 .

(3.18)

the minus sign in (3.17) arises from the action of  on the n/2-twisted vacua.

from the closed string channel point of view, these two contributions correspond
respectively to the fk-fk and fk-fk+n/2 magnetic interactions, and the k-th term

in each sum involves the exchange of rr forms in the 2k-th twisted sector. bl(r)

indicates the hirzebruch polynomial, and is crucial for the cancellation of anomalies
due to (anti)self-dual tensors [6].

inows
collecting these results, one nds the following expressions for the various inows:

ch(k f9) ch(k f5) i1/2(r) ,

7the matrices used here dier from those in [21] in the fact that there is no relative phase between
the matrices in the 9 and the 5 sectors. the necessity of such a phase is avoided here by taking
explicitly into account the xed-point degeneracy, achieving a complete symmetry between the 9
and the 5 sectors.

it is straightforward but tedious to check that the total inow, obtained by sum-

4. factorization of the couplings

as discussed in previous section, the various tree-level bb, bf and ff inows can-
cel separately corresponding pieces of the total one-loop anomaly, and are interpreted
as magnetic interactions. having computed all the inows, the anomalous couplings
to rr elds can be obtained by factorization. starting from (3.19)-(3.23) and know-
ing which (and how) massless elds arise in these orientifold models [21] in all closed
string sectors, untwisted and twisted, it is possible to identify those responsible for
the inows above. using the crucial property [7]

qba(r)qbl(r/4) =qba(r/2) ,

(4.1)

and making use of the fact that only the 8-form components of all the polynomials
are relevant to perform some rescalings, it is straightforward to show that the inows
(3.19)-(3.23) can be indeed consistently factorized.

recall now that these inows of anomaly are associated with rr magnetic inter-
actions. the latter arise in string theory in the odd spin-structure, the insertion of
(1)f acting as hodge duality on the propagating eld [38]. it is easy to deduce from
the analysis of [20, 21] that the only elds mediating rr magnetic interactions are 2-
forms in the rr untwisted sector, and 0-forms (scalars) magnetically dual to 4-forms,
as well as anti-self-dual 2-forms, in the twisted rr sectors. the content of this kind
in the untwisted rr sector, there
of elds of the various models is the following.

16

are always an anti-self-dual and a self-dual 2-form. they lie in the universal tensor
multiplet and in the gravitational multiplet respectively, and together they form an
unconstrained 2-form b. in the twisted rr sectors, a variable number of scalars
and anti-self-dual 2-forms occurs, depending on the model. more precisely, one has
to distinguish between k-twisted closed string sectors with k = n/2 and k 6= n/2.
at each of the nn/2 = 16 n/2-xed points, one gets a scalar  belonging to an ex-
tra hypermultiplet. some among these are further identied by the zn projection,
and the number of independent scalars is 16 for z2, 0 for z3, 10 for z4 and 6 for
z6. similarly, at each of the nk k-xed-points with k 6= n/2, one gets a scalar (k),
belonging to an extra hypermultiplet, and one anti-self-dual 2-form b(k)
 , belonging
to one extra tensor multiplet. actually, these arise by combining the sectors with
twists k and n  k, which are related by the -projection. again, the zn projection
further identies some of these among each other; the net number of them is 0 for
z2, 9 (from k = 1, 2) for z3, 4 (from k = 1, 3) for z4 and 1+5=6 (from k = 1, 5 and
k = 2, 4 respectively) for z6. there is an evident and important distinction arising
between the inows due to the exchange of tensor and scalar elds. tensor elds
can have anomalous couplings only to 4-forms, and the corresponding contribution to
the 8-form anomaly polynomial will factorize into the product of two 4-forms. scalar
elds can instead have anomalous couplings to 2 and 6-forms, and the corresponding
contribution to the 8-form anomaly polynomial will factorize into the product of a
2-form and a 6-form. this implies that all the inows induced by exchange of scalars
and their dual 4-forms involve always the abelian part of the gauge group.

throughout this section, for simplicity, we will always write at the same time
anomalous couplings for forms and their duals, despite the well known fact that
there is no local and covariant lagrangian in which a potential and its dual can
appear at the same time. more precisely, one should write the couplings to the dual
potential as corrections to the kinetic terms for the eld strength of the original
potential, modifying then its bianchi identity. in presence of anti-self-dual forms our
formulae for the couplings should be considered as formal expressions that reproduce
the right inow of anomaly. more precisely, they should be written either in a non-
covariant way, by using the electro-magnetically symmetric action introduced in [39],
or covariantly using the formalism introduced in [40].

we now present a general analysis, valid for all the k3 orientifolds considered here,
allowing to extract in a systematic way the couplings and to emphasize some general
features which are common to all models. in order to keep the analysis as general
as possible, we nd it convenient to keep all the 16 z2-twisted scalars and the nk
tensors and scalars arising from the k and nk twisted sectors, as independent states.
although the physical propagating states are less than that, as mentioned, this will
facilitate the general analysis and yet remain correct. in next section, the anomalous
couplings associated to the physical scalar elds will be explicitly displayed.

in order to gure out which states are responsible for the various inows, recall

17

that in (3.19)-(3.20) the insertion of gk acts as a k-twist in  for the closed string
state exchanged and as a 2k-twist in  in (3.21)-(3.23).
it is natural to consider
separately the k = 0, k = n/2 closed string sectors which are special in many
respects, and to group the remaining closed string sectors into conjugate pairs, adding
the contributions of the k and n  k twisted sectors which correspond to the same
intermediate closed string states.

untwisted closed string exchange
the non-vanishing contributions to the inows (3.19)-(3.23) involving untwisted closed
string states of the k = 0 sector, come form the terms k = 0 in (3.20) and (3.22),
k = n/2 in (3.21) and k = 0, n/2 in (3.23). they can be written as

i (0)95
bb (r, f5, f9) = y 9
i (0)9,5
(r, f9,5) = y 9,5

i (0)
f f (r) = y(0)(r) y(0)(r) ,

(4.2)

(4.3)

the rr elds involved in the inow are the untwisted 2-form b and its magnetic
dual b. form a ten-dimensional point of view, b is the trivial dimensional reduction
of the rr 2-form, whereas b arises from integrating the rr 6-form on t 4. the
magnetic duality of b and b in six dimensions follows from the fact that the rr
2 and 6-forms in ten-dimensions have eld-strengths which are hodge dual to each
other. form the known form of the anomalous couplings of d-branes and o-planes in
ten-dimensions, we then expect that the combinations of elds coupling to d5-branes
and o5-planes, and d9-branes and o9-planes, are simply:

c(0) = b , c(0) = b .

(4.4)

the reason for this is the following. d5-branes and o5-planes couple to both the
rr 2-form and 6-form in ten-dimension. however, the total charge with respect to
the latter cancels by the requirement of tadpole cancellation, and only the 2-form is
relevant, producing b in six dimensions. conversely, since all the internal curvatures
vanish, the integral over t 4 in the anomalous couplings of d9-branes and o9-planes
can act only on the rr 6-form, producing b in six dimensions.

and (3.20)8. they can be written as

2k > n/2 in (4.19) (actually arising only for the f 2 xed-point in the z6 model)
are not independent elds, but rather are dened as c(2k) = c(n 2k) in terms of
those with 2k < n/2. this is at the origin of the second term in the klein bottle
contribution of (4.14). again, some details needed to check that these anomalous
couplings reproduce the above inows are reported in appendix a.

summarizing, the anomalous couplings for d5-branes, d9-branes and fk-xed-
points, in a generic d = 6 zn orientifold model, are given by equations (4.5)-(4.8)
in the untwisted sector, (4.12) and (4.13) in the z2-twisted sector, and (4.17)-(4.19)
in the other twisted sectors. as usual, it is understood that only the appropriate
component of the polynomials has to be considered, in this case the 6-form component.
notice that the inow completely xes the coecients in the combinations (4.11) and
(4.16) of the rr tensors, since they are anti-self dual, but strictly speaking it does
not x completely those between the rr scalars and dual four-forms. our choice is
just the simplest and most natural one in which they are taken to be equal. this
should be always taken into account in the next sections when we write explicitly
these couplings. not surprisingly, d5 and d9-branes have rr anomalous couplings
in each closed string sector. o5-planes, corresponding in our language to the z2-
xed-points fn/2, as well as o9-planes, have instead rr anomalous couplings only
in the untwisted sector. finally, the other xed-points f k have non-vanishing rr
anomalous couplings only in the 2k-twisted sector. the explicit results for each of the
models we are considering are reported in appendix b. notice nally that for k = 0
and k = n/2, the charges contain only 4p-forms and 4p+2-forms respectively, whereas
for k 6= 0, n/2, they contain generically 2p-forms. in the anomalous couplings above,
this is compatible with the fact that the formal sums c (k)
ik contain only 2-forms for
k = 0, only 0 and 4-forms for k = n/2, and both 0, 2 and 4-forms for k 6= 0, n/2.
5. anomaly cancellation

in this section, we present a more detailed model by model analysis of the inow
mechanism. we rst identify more precisely which rr elds give rise to the various
sub-inows. applying the general factorization described in last section, we then write
explicitly all the anomalous couplings for each model, and verify that these couplings
lead to the correct inow. this allow to nd the factorized form of the anomaly
and the inow, exhibiting explicitly the details of the green-schwarz mechanism at
work. as expected, we will see that similarly to what happens in the z2 model
[26], various u(1) factors of the gauge group are spontaneously broken by a higgs
mechanism involving the various rr twisted scalars, belonging to hypermultiplets.
we will discuss this phenomenon in more detail in the next section. for completeness,
we report below the analysis of the z2 model, although a full and detailed discussion

21

of anomaly cancellation in this model has been already given in [26].

5.1. z2-model

the rr massless states arising in the model are the following:

untwisted :
z2-twisted : j , j = 1, ..., 16 .

b , i ,

i = 1, ..., 6 ,

each of the twisted scalars j belongs to a six-dimensional n = 1 hypermultiplet.
by using the general results of last section, it is straightforward to nd the explicit
anomalous couplings for this model, reported in (b.1). expliciting all the polynomials,
the total anomalous term is found to be

this leads to an anomalous variation of the eective action that is exactly equal and

opposite to the total anomaly a = 2ir (in + ic)(1), as can be easily veried.

5.2. z3-model

the massless rr states are:

untwisted :

z3-twisted :

i = 1, ..., 4 ,

b , i ,
bm
 , m , m = 1, ..., 9 .

each of the 9 twisted scalars belong to a hypermultiplet, whereas each of the 9
antisymmetric tensors belong to a tensor multiplet. in this case only twisted closed
string states participate to the inow. the anomalous couplings are again easily

and cancels the total anomaly polynomial in + ic. notice that the untwisted sec-
tor anomalous coupling does not contribute to the inow, but gives nevertheless a
non-trivial contribution to the bianchi identity of the antisymmetric tensor of the
untwisted sector.

5.3. z4-model

the rr massless states are:

untwisted :

i = 1, ..., 4 ,

b , i ,

z4-twisted :

the rr z4-twisted scalars and tensors belong respectively to 4 hyper multiplets and 4
tensor multiplets, whereas the z2-twisted scalars belong to 10 hypermultiplets. using
the generic results found before, one arrives to the anomalous couplings (b.3), which
lead to the following anomalous lagrangian

the form of the u(1) combinations coupling to the various scalars can be checked
as follows. whenever a k-twisted scalar eld couples to a u(1) gauge eld, the
corresponding two-point function on the disk, with the gauge eld vertex operator on
the boundary and the closed string scalar vertex operator in its interior, has to be
non-vanishing. denoting with  the chan-paton wave function associated to the two
u(1) gauge elds, due to the k-twist, the amplitude in question will be proportional
it is easy to see that with our choice of basis, the chan-paton wave
to tr (k).
functions for the u(1) combinations f a
 are 1,2 = diag (i8,i8,i8,i8), in
both the  = 9, 5 sectors. it is then clear that tr (ik)  i

fact that the inows due to the k = 1 and k = 2 twisted scalars do not mix.

6. field theory analysis

in this section, we analyze some aspects of the low-energy eective action of
the orientifold models discussed here.
in particular, we focus on some interesting
implications of the anomaly cancelling couplings found in section ve and other terms
related to them by n = 1 d = 6 supersymmetry.

6.1. anomalous u(1)s

as already shown in detail for the z2 case in [26], a generalized green-schwarz
mechanism involving scalars induces an higgs mechanism breaking various u(1) fac-
tors of the gauge group. as expected, this feature is common to all iib orientifold
models discussed here. dierently from the z2 case, however, one has in general to
carefully establish whether the rr twisted scalars belong to hyper or tensor mul-
tiplets. luckily, the answer can be derived from [31], where it was shown that the
scalars belonging to the extra tensor multiplets are actually twisted nsns scalars11.
this implies that all the rr twisted scalars involved in the inow mechanism analyzed
in section ve belong to neutral hypermultiplets, like in the z2 case. the analysis is
then identical to that of [26]. after an integration by parts and a duality transforma-
tion, the anomalous couplings to the various four-forms reported in last section enter
as corrections to the kinetic terms of the corresponding dual scalars. for these elds
strength to be gauge invariant, the scalars have then to transform anomalously under
the corresponding u(1) gauge transformation. in order to write explicit expression,
it is convenient to use the linear combinations of scalar elds entering the inows as
new independent elds i. by doing so, the combinations ai of u(1) gauge elds
entering as shifts in the eld-strengths

h i = di 

ai
2

(6.1)

are directly related to the combinations x i
2 of 2-forms in the corresponding factor of
the inows derived in section ve, that is (5.1), (5.3), (5.7) and (5.11). the precise
relation is x i
2 = 1/dai, so that the gauge eld ai is essentially the rst descent
of x2: ai = x i(0)
. also the anomalous transformations are easily deduced: under
the gauge transformation ai = di, the scalars transform as i = i /2.

2

11we thank a. sagnotti for very useful discussions about this point.

26

using the general results and the notation of section four, the anomalous interac-
tion leading to the shift in the eld strengths of the twisted scalars (k) can be written
in a very compact form. one nds

in the following, we report explicit expressions for each model in terms of the physical
scalars12.

z2-model
in the z2 case, the combinations of scalars participating to the inow and the corre-
sponding u(1) gauge elds are given by

a9 .

the two scalars 1,2 are eaten by the two u(1) gauge elds a1,2 through a higgs
mechanism, and the latter become massive. since supersymmetry remains unbroken,
the whole hypermultiplets containing 1,2 must become massive. this is indeed what
happens since the inhomogeneous u(1) gauge transformations of the scalars 1,2 turn
some d-terms into mass terms for the remaining scalars in the hypermultiplet [41, 26]
and, most likely, the two weyl fermions of opposite chiralities, belonging to the vector
and hyper multiplet, combine into a single massive dirac fermion. since in this
higgsing the only states that disappear from the massless spectrum and contribute
to gauge and gravitational anomalies are the two massless chiral fermions, of opposite
chiralities, the model remains anomaly-free, with unbroken (su(16))2 gauge group.

all the four u(1) factors are then spontaneously broken, leaving as unbroken gauge

there are only ve independent combinations of scalars involved in the higgs mecha-

straightforward to determine how the surviving u(1) factor is embedded in the original
gauge group. indeed, the corresponding gauge eld is the linear combination which
is orthogonal to a15, and is found to be similar to a1, but with a relative minus sign
between 5 and 9 factors.

a similar analysis can be performed in the more general case where we have
arbitrary congurations for the d5 branes and non-vanishing wilson lines in the nine
branes gauge groups. although we do not report this more general analysis, it is clear
that in any conguration the maximum number of u(1)s that can be higgsed cannot
exceed the number of rr twisted closed string scalars present in each model.

6.2. gauge couplings

let us now turn our attention to the chern-simons couplings of the tensor elds.
the most remarkable property of these terms is that their structure is related by
supersymmetry to the gauge couplings constants 1/g2 of the theory [25]. whenever
some of them vanish or become negative, tensionless strings appear and the model

28

undergoes a phase transition [28, 29, 30]. it is then extremely useful to analyze in
detail anomaly cancellation, being a useful tool to address such questions.

in order to be more concrete, we briey review here some general properties of
n = 1 d = 6 supergravity coupled to nt tensor multiplets and vector multiplets of
some gauge group. for details we refer the reader to [42] and references therein. the
coupling to the hypermultiplet sector does not play any role in the discussion that
will follow and it will be omitted13. the kinetic terms for the bosonic elds of the
theory, including the chern-simons couplings for the two-forms, are [42]

z are con-
stants, and z labels dierent factors of the gauge group. the crucial observation of
[25] is that the same coecients cr
z appear in the bianchi identities and couplings for
br and in the gauge couplings. among the nt + 1 eld strengths h r, h (+) = vr h r
is self-dual, while k m () = xm
r h r are anti-self-dual. the lagrangian (6.2) presents
a manifest global so(1, nt ) symmetry rotating the tensor elds, the scalars and the
constants cr
z. in writing a local covariant lagrangian as in (6.2), it is understood that
the (anti)self-duality constraints for the eld strengths must be imposed only after
varying the lagrangian, at the level of equations of motion. alternatively, following
the work of [40], one could add an auxiliary scalar eld and additional terms to the
model that take into account the (anti)self-duality conditions. we will not do that,
since this will be irrelevant for our considerations, but notice that such lagrangian,
including all four-fermion terms, already appeared in [44].

in order to better understand how to apply these general considerations to the
iib orientifold models analyzed here, it is useful to consider rst a model with nt = 1
and arbitrary gauge group. in this case, the so(1, 1) matrix is simply parametrized
by v0 = cosh  = x1
0. we can also combine the self-dual and
anti-self-dual tensors to form an unconstrained two-form eld. choosing the simple
combination b = 1/2(b0  b1), the lagrangian (6.2) becomes

other linear combination b = 1/2(b0 + b1) since its dynamics is completely determined
from that of b. let us connect this lagrangian with the one expected from type i
compactied on k3. in presence of d5-branes, the ten dimensional kinetic terms for
b and the f9,5 eld strengths are schematically, in the string frame:

where v4 is the volume of k3. by comparing (6.5) with (6.3), we see that v4 = e2hi,
 being the scalar in the tensor multiplet. moreover the comparison requires also that
c9 = c5 = 0. this is the case for the z2 orientifold model, where these considerations
apply. we found in last section that the tensor eld b couples only to the gauge group
of the 5 sector through x (5)
4 , whereas its bianchi identity, obtained by integrating by
parts and dualizing the coupling to b, involves only the 9 sector. moreover c5 = c9 > 0;
no phase transitions can occur in this case.

i sinh , i = 1, ..., nt , where i are coordinates on the unit s(nt 1)-sphere (pi 2

let us consider now the other orientifold models with nt > 1. the rst task is
to identify the combination of anti-self-dual and self-dual tensor elds giving rise to
the unconstrained untwisted b eld and to the remaining nt  1 tensors. although
these models do not have a clear geometric interpretation, the kinetic term for the
untwisted tensor eld b, being independent of the details of the orientifold, can still
be seen as a reduction from d = 10 to d = 6 and has to be multiplied just by
the volume v4 of the internal orbifold.
in this case, we dene the scalar  such
that v4 = e2hi. let us now parametrize the scalar elds vr as v0 = cosh , vi =
i =
1). with this choice of parametrization, there is a natural (and probably unique)
choice for the vacuum expectation values for the scalars vr and xm
r , that reproduce
i = i
the kinetic term for h: hvi0 = coshhi = hxi1
i
for i, i = 2, ..., nt , all the other being equal to zero. this strongly suggests that the
orientifold string construction is appropriate only at this point in the moduli space
parametrized by the vacuum expectation values of the scalars belonging to the extra
tensor multiplets. notice that the vacuum hii = 0 breaks the global so(1, nt )
symmetry spontaneously to so(1, 1) so(nt  1). the untwisted b eld is obtained
precisely like in the nt = 1 case whereas bi = k i() are identied with the additional
nt  1 anti-self-dual two-forms. correspondingly, at this point in moduli space the
gauge coupling constants depend only on the coecients cz and cz associated to the
bianchi identity and couplings of b only. notice that for all the zn models c9 = c5 = 0
and c5 = c9 > 0. again, all the gauge kinetic terms are positive denite at this
particular point in the moduli space.

all the coecients cz

r do not depend on the vevs of the scalars vr and can be
xed from the four-forms x4 found in last section. this allows to analyze the gauge
couplings for generic values of the moduli. we have checked that for each of the
models considered here there exist a continuous family of points in moduli space
where the gauge couplings vanish and tensionless strings occur. a detailed analysis
of the loci where this phenomenon occurs and their interpretation would be extremely
interesting. as an illustrative example, consider the z3 model. modulo an irrelevant
overall factor, the constants cr
z for the two factors z = a, b of the gauge group are
b = 1/62,
a = c1
found to be c0
it is then easy to check that for generic values of hii, there exists
m = 1, ..., 9.
in general a value of hi, corresponding to a particular v4, for which vrcr
z vanishes.
choosing for instance h1i = 0, hi>1i = 1/3, the gauge couplings of fa and fb
vanish for cothhi = 3 and cothhi = 23 respectively.

a = 1/62, cm

b = 1/46, cm

a = 1/26, c0

the linear couplings of the scalars to the eld strengths can also be derived once
z are known. using the general results and notation of section four,

the constants cr
these couplings can be rewritten in a concise way as

b = c1

where (k), k = 1, ..., n/21 are the nsns twisted scalars belonging to the additional
tensor multiplets, and f5,9 are now conventional eld-strengths rather than curvature
two-forms. as for the 9 sector, the above couplings are in agreement with the recent
results of [31], modulo an overall numerical coecient that we have not attempted to
check14.

7. discussion and conclusions

in this paper, we have computed particular topological amplitudes in the odd spin-
structure enabling us to understand in detail how anomalies cancel in a class of n = 1
d = 6 orientifold models with maximal unbroken gauge group. by factorization, we
have also found the d-brane, o-plane and xed-point couplings to the rr elds
arising in these models.

the mechanism of anomaly cancellation applies in its most general form, with
the exchange of dierent tensor elds [25] and, whenever abelian factors are present,
scalar elds as well [41, 26]. the rr scalars involved in the inow mechanism belong
always to neutral hypermultiplets and are responsible for a spontaneous symmetry
breaking of all u(1) factors but one in the z6 model, in the maximally symmetric
case. more generically, the maximum number of u(1) that can be spontaneously
broken never exceeds the number of neutral hypermultiplets arising from the twisted
closed string sector.

14the scalar elds mk of [31] have to be identied as mk = 1/nkpnk

ik=1 (k)ik .

31

by comparing some terms in the low-energy eective actions of these models
with the most general ones allowed by supersymmetry, we deduce that the vacuum
expectation values of the scalars belonging to the extra tensor multiplets are xed
at particular values. in these points in moduli space all the gauge kinetic terms are
denite positive. however, varying these moduli - at directions in the low-energy
action - we always nd special loci where the gauge couplings diverge and tensionless
strings occur. analogously, we can also x the gauge couplings of these scalars for
both the d9 and d5 gauge groups.

the models we discussed in this paper are particular examples of six-dimensional
theories with extra tensor multiplets. these arise for instance in f and m-theory
d = 6 compactications15. in this last case, each extra tensor multiplet is believed
to come from an m5-brane in the bulk of the 11th dimension [46]. although the non-
perturbative heterotic spin(32)/z2 duals to the iib orientifolds models are known
[47], their explicit realization as m-theory vacua is not a simple issue, especially in
the maximally symmetric case discussed here. nevertheless, some questions might still
be qualitatively addressed. assuming that each extra tensor multiplet comes from a
single m5-brane, one might naively hope that these models are somehow related to m-
theory compactied on an orbifold like t 4/zn  s1/z2. however, from [48] it is clear
that such m-theory vacua corresponds to non-perturbative vacua of strongly coupled
e8  e8 heterotic theory on t 4/zn , with total instanton number 25  nt . these
vacua could in turn be related to k3 orientifolds. the nt  1 m5-branes are located
at distinct xed-points of the orbifold. one is also tempted to consider somehow the
vev hii as the moduli corresponding to move the ith brane on the s1/z2 segment.
it seems that the orientifold description requires all these m5-branes to be stuck at
some point in the segment and at dierent xed-points on the t 4/zn orbifold. on
the other hand, in m-theory one has the freedom of moving the m5-branes along
the segment by turning on hii. as already said, this leads to tensionless strings at
special points. it would be then very interesting to better understand the connection
with m-theory by a full and deeper analysis of this phenomenon. in this direction, a
more general analysis with dierent congurations for the d5 branes and with wilson
lines turned on, would also be quite interesting.

generalizing the idea of [48], in compactifying m-theory on orbifolds new twisted
sectors are expected to arise at xed-points. these will play a decisive role in making
the theory anomaly-free.
it would be then extremely interesting to see how new
couplings to the twisted sectors, as well as the compactication of the d = 11 chern-
simons term c3  x8 on orbifolds, are related to the anomalous couplings found here.
this could yield important informations on m-theory at the microscopic level.

15see also [45] for other constructions of these vacua.

a. inows

in this appendix, we recall some formulae from [5] which are needed to check that
the anomalous couplings that we have proposed indeed reproduce the inows from
which they have been derived.

sector k = 0
two anomalous coupling of the form

c(0)  a(f, r) , sb = 2zb

c(0)  b(f, r)

sa = 2za
 (i sa+b) = 2i r i (1)

iab =

ab where

with c(0), c(0) given by (4.4), produce an inow on the ab intersection given by

1

2ha4(f, r) b4(f, r) + a4(f, r) b4(f, r)i .

(a.1)

in this case all the couplings are even in f due to the property ch (f ) = ch (f ) of
the chern class in the chan-paton representation. the inow then reduces to

iab = a4(f, r) b4(f, r) =ha(f, r)  b(f, r)i8

.

(a.2)

of course we neglect here and in the following the eight-form components a8(f, r)
and b8(f, r), because their sum automatically vanishes once the tadpole conditions
are solved, and therefore there is no inow associated with them. for non-distinct
objects, an additional 1/2 is needed.

sector k = n/2
two anomalous coupling of the form

sa = 2za

c i

(n/2)  a(f, r) , sb = 2zb

c i
(n/2)  b(f, r)

with c i

(n/2) given by (4.11), produce an inow on the ab intersection given by

iab =

1

2ha2(f, r) b6(f, r) + a6(f, r) b2(f, r)

+a2(f, r) b6(f, r) + a6(f, r) b2(f, r)i .

(a.3)

33

now all the couplings are odd in f due to the property ch (n/2(f )) = ch (n/2f )
in the chan-paton representation. the inow then reduces to
iab = a2(f, r) b6(f, r)  a6(f, r) b2(f, r) = ha(f, r)  b(f, r)i8

(a.4)

.

for non-distinct objects, an additional 1/2 is needed.

sectors k 6= 0, n/2
the anomalous couplings

sa = 2za

c ik

(k)  a(f, r) , sb = 2zb

c ik
(k)  b(f, r)

with c ik

(k) as in (4.16), produce an inow given by

iab =

1

2ha2(f, r) b6(f, r) + a6(f, r) b2(f, r)
+a2(f, r) b6(f, r) + a6(f, r) b2(f, r)
a4(f, r) b4(f, r)  a4(f, r) b4(f, r)i .

(a.5)

furthermore, the 4-form couplings are even in f whereas the 2 and 6-form couplings
are odd, due to the property ch (k(f ))|p = ()p/2ch (kf )|p valid for the p-form
component. the inow then reduces to

iab =  a2(f, r) b6(f, r)  a6(f, r) b2(f, r)  a4(f, r) b4(f, r)

.

(a.6)

= ha(f, r)  b(f, r)i8

for non-distinct objects, an additional 1/2 is needed as usual.

b. anomalous couplings

ve, but in a form that makes clearer the dierent contribution due to d9-branes,
d5-branes, o9-planes, o5-planes and fk xed-points.
