abstract

we show that in the supersymmetry framework described by a poincare
superalgebra with tensorial central charges the role of generalized superconfor-
mal symmetry which contains all these central charges is played by osp(1|2k),
where k = 3 for d = 4. following [1,2] we describe the free supertwistor model
for osp(1|8). it appears that in such a scheme the tensorial central charges sat-
isfy additional relations and the model describes the tower of supersymmetric
massless states with an arbitrary (integer and halfinteger) helicity spectrum.

1 introduction

let us recall that in the standard supersymmetry scheme [3,4] only scalar central
charges are allowed. in particular d = 4 n-extended susy has the following most

in a generalized supersymmetry scheme,

in order to characterize all possible
sources describing charged p-branes, domain walls etc. one uses nonvanishing ten-
sorial central charges z ij

where p and traceless y i

j (y i

 are complex and

selfdual with respect to spacetime indices, and their hermitian conjugate ez (ij) =
ez (ji) =  ez (ij) are anti-selfdual. it should be mentioned that from the algebraic

point of view it is also possible to introduce additional spinorial fermionic charges
into [p, q] and [z, q] commutators (see e.g. [7,8]). in this talk we shall consider only
the case of bosonic tensorial central charges.

in particular, for n = 1, d = 4, using real majorana supercharges we get

{q, q} = p = (c) p + (c) z,

(4)

where the real tensor z describes six tensorial central charges. it has been rstly
shown in [1] that the presence of nonvanishing tensorial central charges z allows one
to describe the superparticle model with only one broken target space supersymmetry
(i.e. 3/4 susy remains unbroken)4.

if we wish to realize the superalgebra (4) as an extension of the standard super-
space framework one should introduce additional 6 bosonic central charge coordinates
(see e.g.
[1,2,9]). with increase in the number of space-time dimensions the num-
for d = 11 one has
ber of these additional bosonic coordinates grow rapidly (e.g.

3for simplicity, we consider here only the supercharge sector (fermion-fermion relations), which

forms the subsuperalgebra of the full n -extended poincare superalgebra.

supertwistor framework [10, 11] and extend the penrose formula for massless momenta

to the sector of central charges by assuming composite formulae5

in such a way we obtain the tensorial central charges satisfying some constraints, and
the number of independent degrees of freedom in dimension d is determined by the
real dimension of the fundamental spinor representation. in particular, for d = 4
we have n = 4 degrees of freedom, for d = 5, 6 and 7 there are n = 8 degrees,
for d = 8, 9 and 10 n = 16, and for d = 11 we have n = 32.
if we consider
the dimensions d = 3, 4, 6, 10 describing respectively the sequence of real, complex,
quaternionic and octonionic pair of supercharges we see that subtracting d1 degrees
of freedom describing massless momenta we obtain respectively m = 0, 1, 3, 7 internal
variables parametrizing the spheres sm [2].

2 generalized superconformal symmetries and ten-

sorial central charges

standard conformal algebras in d dimensions are isomorphic to the orthogonal alge-
bras o(d, 2). in order to introduce the standard conformal superalgebra we should
consider the fundamental spinorial realization of o(d, 2). the dimensions d = 3, 4
and 6 are specic in the sense that then the spin coverings of so(d, 2) are described
by the classical groups, namely, spin(3, 2) = sp(4; r), spin(4, 2) = su(2, 2) and
spin(6, 2) = u(4, h) = u(4, 4)  sp(8; c) = usp(4, 4; c)6. supersymmetrization
implies that

d = 3 :
d = 4 :
d = 6 :

sp(4; r)  osp(n; 1|r)
su(2, 2)  su(2, 2|n)
u(4; h)  uu(n; 4|r)

the standard conformal algebra o(d, 2) has the following three-fold grading

o(d, 2) = p  l  k

(7)

(8)

where p corresponds to the sector of d translation generators, l = m  r contains
lorentz o(d  1, 1) rotations m and the dilatation generator r, and k describe d

5in [12] tensorial central charges are,

in contrast, the composites of the momenta for a

multiparticlemultitime system.

6we shall not include into this sequence d = 10 with octonionic nonassociative group-like
matrices u(4; o) (for more extensive discussion see [13]). by u(n ; f ) we denote the group of
symplecticunitary matrices (u u = , t = ) over a eld f .

conformal boosts. the supersymmetrization of the graded structure (8) for n = 1 is
performed by taking the supersymmetric square roots of the o(d, 2) generators in
the following way (g = u(1) for d = 4, and u(2) for d = 6):

{q, q}  p,

{s, s}  k,

{q, s}  l  g.

(9)

where g describe internal symmetry generators. the superalgebra (8,9) is endowed
with a vefold graded structure p  q  (l  g)  s  k.

in order to introduce generalized conformal superalgebras which include tensorial
central charges we should generalize the set of relations (9). in d = 4 the generalized
conformal algebra is obtained by replacing four-momenta generators p with ten
generators (p, z), (see (4)), and for d = 4 in place of (9) we obtain the following
simple real superalgebra:

{q, q} = p,

{s, s} = k,

{q, s} = l.

(10)

the relations (10) contain two copies of the poincare superalgebra (4) and 16 real
bosonic charges l generate gl(4; r). we thus get a generalized d = 4 confor-
mal algebra given by sp(8) (note that sp(8) contains su(2, 2))

su(2, 2) = spin(4, 2)



sp(8) = p  l  k,

(11)

and the generalized d = 4 superconformal algebra (10) is described by osp(1; 8).

one can also introduce an n-extended d = 4 generalized superconformal group
osp(n; 8) (su(2, 2|n)  osp(2n; 8) as well as the ones for d > 4 containing d
dimensional superpoincare algebra with all possible tensorial charges [14, 15]. for
example, in d = 10 all 126 central charges are included in the simple generalized
superconformal algebra osp(1; 32) [15].

3 supertwistorial realizations of generalized su-

perconformal symmetries

let us consider the following realization of the superalgebra osp(1; 8) described by
the relations (10):

a) bosonic sector

p = ,

m = ,

k = .

(12a)

b) fermionic sector (2 = 1)

q = ,

s = 

(12b)

where

n, o =  

 ,

2 = 1

(12c)

and raising of indices is performed with the help of an sp(4) antisymmetric metric.
it is easy to see that the rst relation (12a) is equivalent to the relations (5-6).
the relation with the superspace description is obtained via the following version
of penrose-ferber formulae (see [11]) relating supertwistor coordinates with super-
space coordinates

where (, , ) describes an osp(1|8) supertwistor and

 = 

(13)

(14)

x  =

(c) x

8

(c) y[].

the four coordinates x describe d = 4 space-time, and y[] = y[] are six central
charge coordinates, dual to the tensorial central charges z[].

4 new class of massless superparticle models

our aim here is

i) to construct the superparticle model with the momenta and tensorial charges

given by the relations (5, 6) and

ii) to show that it is equivalent to the free particle model in supertwistor space.
we start with the following brinkschwarzlike action (see also [16]):

s =z d(cid:16)p   epp (cid:17) ,

where p  is a symmetric 4  4 matrix, e is an einbein and

 =

dx 

d

 i( d)
d

.

substituting the ansatz (12a) p =  into (15) we get

s =z d  =z d(cid:16)aba b + a bab +  a b a b(cid:17)

where (we use the 2-component weyl spinor notation)

(17)

the model (16) describes the generalized momenta p satisfying the relations

pp  = 0 or more explicitly (using the notation of eqs. (5-6)):

pa bp a b = 0, zabz ab = z a b

z a b = 0, zabp b c = pa bz bc = 0

(18)

the relations (18) reduce 10 real degrees of freedom (p, z[]) to four real indepen-
dent degrees of freedom. in particular, if we introduce three degrees describing d = 4
massless momenta (~p, p0 = |~p|), one can describe the fourth degree of freedom ei as
the phase of the spinor a, which e.g. can be expressed as ei4 = z12/ z 1 2

in such a way we obtain the d = 4 massless superparticle model with additional
internal u(1) degree of freedom. in particular if we perform quantization (see [2])
we obtain the superwave function  which depends only on independent variables
a,  a and one-dimensional grassmann coordinate  (2 = 0; see (13))

(cid:16)a,  a, (cid:17) = (cid:16)a,  a(cid:17) + i(cid:16)a,  a(cid:17)

(19)

since the set of variables (cid:16)a,  a(cid:17) is equivalent to (p (p2 = 0); ei), where p =

, and 12 = |1||2|e2i, one gets



(cid:16)a,  a(cid:17) = xkz

e(2k+1)ik+ 1

(pk)

(cid:16)a,  a(cid:17) = xkz

(20a)

(20b)

the massless elds collected in (20a) carry integer helicities (s = k), and the elds
in (20b) are endowed with half-integer helicities (s = k + 1
2) in accordance with the
spin-statistics theorem for the d = 4 relativistic theories.

in d = 4 the model (16) contains superspace variables (x , a,  b) extended by
central charge coordinates y as well as by the spinors a,  b describing half of
the bosonic components of the osp(1|8) supertwistor. if we substitute the relations
(13) adapted to d = 4 into the action (16) the latter can be expressed in terms
of supertwistor components zk = (a,  a, ) and thus becomes the free osp(1; 8)
supertwistor action (see [2] for details)

where  = 1

s =z d(cid:16)a a +  a  a + i (cid:17)
 a(cid:17).

5 final remarks

(21)

the classical and quantum version of d = 4 massless superparticle model with innite
spectra of helicities can be

- extended to dimensions d > 4, in particular to d = 6 and d = 10 [2]
- generalized to the super-anti-de-sitter background [17].
