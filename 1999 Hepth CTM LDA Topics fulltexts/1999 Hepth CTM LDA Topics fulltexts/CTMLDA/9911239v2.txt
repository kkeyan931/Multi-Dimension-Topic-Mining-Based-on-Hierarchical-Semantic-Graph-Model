abstract

a two dimensional gauge theory is canonically associated to every
drinfeld double. for particular doubles, the theory turns out to be
e.g. the ordinary yang-mills theory, the g/g gauged wznw model
or the poisson -model that underlies the kontsevich quantization
formula. we calculate the arbitrary genus partition function of the
latter. the result is the q-deformation of the ordinary yang-mills
partition function in the sense that the series over the weights is re-
placed by the same series over the q-weights. for q equal to a root of
unity the series acquires the ane weyl symmetry and its truncation
to the alcove coincides with the verlinde formula.

1 introduction

the original motivation of this article was to elucidate a relation between the
yang-mills theory in two dimensions and the g/g gauged wznw model.
it is known [1, 2] that the latter can be understood as a sort of a nonlinear
deformation of the former. the rst main result of this work shows that it
exists a whole moduli space of two dimensional gauge theories which contains
the both theories mentioned above as special points.

throughout this paper, g will denote a simple compact connected and
simply connected lie group. we shall argue that the moduli space of yang-
mills-like theories in two dimensions based on the group g coincides with the
space of doubles d(g) of g and we shall refer to the points in this moduli
space as to poisson-lie yang-mills theories. we dene a double d(g) of an
n-dimensional real lie group g to be any 2n-dimensional real lie group d
(containing g as its subgroup) such that its lie algebra d is equipped with
an symmetric invariant non-degenerate r-bilinear form h., .i with respect to
which the lie algebra g of g is isotropic (i.e. hg,gi = 0).
our second main result is an observation that the poisson -models, corre-
sponding to the poisson-lie structures on group manifolds, are special points
in our moduli space. more precisely, they are the poisson-lie yang-mills the-
ories with vanishing coupling constant. a particular example of the poisson
-model is the bf theory which indeed can be obtained from the ordinary
yang-mills theory by setting to zero the coupling constant of the latter.

the poisson -models were introduced by ikeda [3] and schaller and

strobl [4] for manifolds without boundary. their actions read

s = z

(ci  dx i +

1
2

ij(x)ci  cj).

(1)

here x i is the set of coordinates on the manifold m viewed as functions on
the world-sheet , ij(x) denotes a bivector eld (i.e. a section of 2t m)
which denes the poisson structure on m and ci is a set of 1-form elds on
 which can be interpreted as sections of the bundle x (t m)  t .
recently, cattaneo and felder [5] have shown that certain correlators of
the poisson -models, corresponding to insertions at the boundary of the
disc, are computed by the kontsevich formula [6]. this is in the sense of
the perturbation expansion in the eld theoretic planck constant h. in our
picture, this planck constant h turns out to be the parameter which multiplies

1

the poisson-lie bracket on g and therefore it can be interpreted as the planck
constant also from this point of view.

the third main result of this paper is the computation of an arbitrary
genus partition function of the poisson-lie yang-mills theory corresponding
to the lu-weinstein-soibelman (lws) drinfeld double d(g). this model
possesses the gauge symmetry based on the group g. for the special case
of the vanishing coupling constant, we thus obtain the partition function of
the poisson -model for the lws poisson-lie structure on the dual group
g. if we set q = e2hb(,), where b(., .) is the killing-cartan form on g
and  is the longest root, this partition function z(q) has an interesting
behaviour in the complex plane q. in fact, for q = 1 it gives the ordinary
bf partition function and for q 6= 1 but equal to a root of unity it gives the
standard verlinde formula [7]. it therefore appears natural to refer to the
partition function of the poisson -model for an arbitrary double d(g) as
to a generalized d(g) verlinde formula.

all those results suggest that the kontsevich and the verlinde formulae
are in fact cousins; a general correlator of the poisson -model with bulk and
boundary insertions, on arbitraty genus and for arbitrary double d(g) is the
object that appears to generalize both of them.

in section 2, we shall dene the poisson-lie yang-mills theory as the
gauge theory canonically associated to every double d(g) and we shall in-
dicate the doubles which give respectively the ordinary yang-mills theory
and the g/g gauged wznw model. in section 3, we review the denition
of the lws double, we identify its poisson-lie yang-mills theory and show
how the poisson -model (1) emerges if the coupling constant vanishes. we
calculate the corresponding partition function in section 4. we use an ap-
propriate generalization of the method of blau and thompson worked out
for the ordinary yang-mills theory and for the g/g gauged wznw model
in [2, 8]. we shall nish with a short outlook.

2 the poisson-lie yang-mills theory

the poisson-lie yang-mills theory, that we shall associate to every double
of a lie group g, is simply obtained by an isotropic gauging of the wznw
model on the double. its action reads

s(l, 10, 01) =

2

i(l) +

oi(l), (2)

1

2 z

[h+ll1, 10i h01, l1li hl01, l1, 10i] + iz

where l is a map from the world-sheet into the double d, and 10 and 01
are respectively (1, 0) and (0, 1) forms on the world-sheet with values in the
isotropic subalgebra g of the lie algebra d of d. i are coupling constants,
 is a volume form on the world-sheet and oi(l) are functions on the group
manifold d which are separately invariant with respect to the left and right
action of g on d.  and + denote the minkowski version of the dolbeault
coboundary operators, in particular, acting on functions they are given by
the standard light-cone derivatives

 =   .

(3)

note that the (2) is written entirely in the language of the dierential forms,
though we have suppressed the symbol of the wedge product. the pure
wznw model action is given in the standard way

i(l) =

1

4 z h+ll1, ll1i +

1

24 z d1hdll1, [dll1, dll1]i.

(4)

of course, it is obvious how to make sense of (4) also when d is not a matrix
group.

in this section and in the following one the poisson-lie yang-mills theory
(2) will be considered only at the classical level; the world-sheet  will be
always a cylinder equipped with the minkowski metric. this means, that
the variation problem with the xed boundary conditions at the initial and
nal time is well-dened (see [9] for more details about the wznw model
on the cylinder). when we x a gauge, we shall always tacitly assume that
those initial and nal boundary conditions are compatible with this xing.

the model (2) is gauge invariant with respect to two mutually commuting

gauge symmetries:

l  glk1,

10  g10g1  gg1,

01  k01k1  kk1,

(5)

where g, k  g are mappings from the world-sheet into the maximally
isotropic subgroup g. the crucial property of the action (4), which is
needed for verifying the gauge invariance (5), is the validity of the polyakov-
wiegmann formula [10]:

i(l1l2) = i(l1) + i(l2) +

3

1

2 z h+l1l1

1 , l1

2 l2i

(6)

let us consider a compact group g and for its double d(g) we take its
cotangent bundle t g. this bundle is of course trivializable, hence we can
represent every point in its total space as a pair (g, x), where g  g and
x  g. the group law is then

(g1, x1)(g2, x2) = (g1g2, coadg1x2 + x1)

(7)
and the lie algebra of t g is the semidirect sum of g and g, where g acts
on g in the coadjoint way. finally, the invariant nondegenerate bilinear
form h., .i on d is given by

h(, x), (, y )i  y () + x(), ,   g, x, y  g.

(8)

if we now partially x the gauge by setting l = (1, x), we obtain from

(2) the following theory

s = 

1

2 z

x(d +   ) + iz

oi(x),

(9)

where  = 10 + 01. if we set all i, but 1, to zero and choose

o1(x) = b(x, x)

(10)

(we denote by the same symbol the dual of the killing-cartan form b(., .) ),
we nd that (9) is nothing but the action of the standard two dimensional
yang-mills theory. moreover, if 1 vanishes, we obtain the bf theory. in
both cases, the theory possesses the standard gauge symmetry with respect
to the group g and in our picture it is just the residual gauge symmetry (5)
that respects the gauge condition l = (1, x). it is given by

x  coadkx,

10  k10k1  kk1,

01  k01k1  +kk1. (11)
an important example is given by another double of the same group g.
we simply take d(g) = g g and the invariant form h., .i on its lie algebra
d  g  g is given by

h(1, 2), (1, 2)i  b(1, 1)  b(2, 2),

(12)

where b(., .) is the standard killing-cartan form on g. clearly, the diagonal
embedding of g into g  g is isotropic, i.e.

h(, ), (, )i = 0.

4

(13)

now we x the gauge l = (g, 1) and evaluate the action of our poisson-lie
yang-mills theory (2). we obtain

s = ib(g)+

1

2 z

where

[b(+gg1, 10)b(01, g1g)b(g01g1, 10)+b(01, 10)], (14)

ib(g) =

1

4 z b(+gg1, gg1)+

1

24 z d1b(dgg1, [dgg1, dgg1]) (15)

and we have set all coupling constants i to zero. needless to say, the model
thus obtained is the gauged g/g wznw model with respect to the form
b(., .). the residual gauge symmetry (5) which preserves the gauge l = (g, 1)
is now

g  kgk1,

10  k10k1  kk1,

01  k01k1  +kk1.

(16)

of course, this is the standard gauge symmetry of the g/g wznw model.

3 lu-weinstein-soibelman doubles

the previous two choices of the doubles of g have lead to the well-known
gauge theories in two dimensions. we shall now consider another important
choice of d(g), where the double of the simple, compact, connected and
simply connected group g is the so called lu-weinstein-soibelman drinfeld
double dlw (g) [11]. we shall see that this choice will lead to the theories
known as the poisson--models [3, 4, 5].

recall, that a general drinfeld double [12] is a 2n-dimensional real lie
group d whose lie algebra d is equipped with an symmetric invariant
non-degenerate r-bilinear form h., .i. moreover, an existence of two n-
dimensional subgroups g and g is required, such that their lie algebras
g and g are isotropic with respect to h., .i and d is the direct sum of the
vector spaces g and g.
clearly, any drinfeld double d containing g as one of its isotropic sub-
groups is the double d(g) in the sense described in the introduction. the
converse need not be true, for we may have a double of g which is not the

5

drinfeld double. inspite of this fact, we refer to the points in our moduli
space as to the poisson-lie yang-mills theories. the reason is the follow-
ing: if the double is indeed the drinfeld double then poisson-lie brackets are
simultaneously induced respectively on the group manifolds g and g. in par-
ticular, to every such poisson-lie structure we associate the corresponding
deformation of the ordinary yang-mills theory.

the lws double is simply the complexication (viewed as the real group)
gc of g. so, for example, the lws double of su(2) is sl(2, c). the
invariant non-degenerate form h., .ih on the lie algebra dlws of dlw s is
given by

hx, yih =

1
h

imb(x, y),

(17)

or, in other words, it is just the imaginary part of the killing-cartan form
divided by a real parameter h. since g is the real form of gc, clearly
the imaginary part of b(x, y) vanishes if x, y  g. hence, g is indeed
isotropically embedded in gc. note the presence of the parameter h which
indicates that we have actually in mind a one-parameter family of doubles.
it turns out that gc is in fact the drinfeld double, because gc is at
the same time the double of its another n-dimensional subgroup g which
coincides with the so called an group in the iwasawa decomposition of gc:

gc = gan.

(18)

for the groups sl(n, c) the group an can be identied with upper triangu-
lar matrices of determinant 1 and with positive real numbers on the diagonal.
in general, the elements of an can be uniquely represented by means of the
exponential map as follows

g = eexp[>0ve]  en.

(19)

here s denote the roots of gc, v are complex numbers and  is an her-
mitian element1 of the cartan subalgebra of gc. loosely said, a is the
noncompact part of the complex maximal torus of gc. the isotropy of
1recall that the hermitian element of any complex simple lie algebra gc is an eigenvec-
tor of the involution which denes the compact real form g; the corresponding eigenvalue
is (1) . the anti-hermitian elements that span the compact real form are eigenvectors of
the same involution with the eigenvalue equal to 1. for elements of sl(n, c) lie algebra,
the hermitian element is indeed a hermitian matrix in the standard sense.

6

the lie algebra g of g = an follows from (19); the fact that g and g
generate together the lie algebra d of the whole double is evident from (18).
in general, a poisson bracket  on a manifold m is a smooth section of
the bivector bundle on m with vanishing schouten bracket

[, ]s = 0.

(20)

moreover, the poisson-lie bracket on a group manifold g has to be compat-
ible with the group multiplication, i.e.

{f1,f2}gg = {f1, f2}g.

(21)

here f (g1, g2) = f (g1g2) is the standard coproduct on the algebra of func-
tions on the group manifold and {., .}gg is the product poisson structure
on g  g:

{f1(x)g1(y), f2(x)g2(y)}gg=

= {f1(x), f2(x)}gg1(y)g2(y) + f1(x)f2(x){g1(y), g2(y)}g,

(22)

where x and y are coordinates on the rst and second copy of g respectively.
of course, we have by denition

{f1, f2}g  (df1, df2).

(23)

since the bivector bundle on the group manifold is trivializable by the
left invariant vector elds, we loose no information about the poisson-lie
structure  if we trade it for another object, namely a map  : g  2g
dened as follows

(g)  ij(g) t i  t j  lg1g,

(24)

where t i is some basis of g, g is the value of the poisson bivector  at the
point g of the group manifold and lg1 is the push-forward map with respect
to the left translation by the element g1. the conditions (20) and (21) for
the poisson-lie structure  translate under (24) to the following conditions
for (g):

kl(kij +

f km

jmi) + cycl(l, i, j) = 0

ij(g) = ji(g),
imj 

f km

(25)

(26)

and

here f km

(gh) = (h) + adh1(g).
j are the structure constants of g dened as

[t k, t m] = f km

jt j

and k is a dierential operator acting on functions on g as follows

kf (g) 

d
dt

f (gett k

)|t=0.

(27)

(28)

(29)

note that the condition (27) simply says that (g) is a 1-cocycle in the group
cohomology of g with values in 2g.
now let us introduce an h-dependent family of the poisson-lie brackets on
the group manifolds g and g = an, which are called the lws poisson-lie
structures. they are completely determined by the adjoint representation of
gc. to describe them, it is convenient to introduce a basis t i in g and its
dual basis ti in g. the duality means the following relation

moreover we have

h ti, t jih = j
i ,

[ ti, tj] = f

ij

k

tk.

(30)

(31)

a convenient choice of t is and of tis is given, respectively, by the set
(e + e), i(e  e), ihi and its dual ihe, he, hhi. here hi is an
(hermitian) orthonormal basis of the cartan subalgebra t with respect to
the killing-cartan form and e, e are eigenvectors of t corresponding
to roots . of course, any other basis performs equally well.
in fact, we
could choose also a basis independent description. it seems to us, however,
that in these particular cirmumstances the work with some chosen basis will
positively inuence the clarity of the exposition. now for each h, dene the
following matrices (cf. [13])

a j
i (g) = hg1 tig, t jih,

bij(g) = hg1t ig, t jih,

g  g

and

ai

j(g) = hg1t ig, tjih, bij(g) = hg1 ti g, tjih,

g  g.

(32)

(33)

8

it is then a simple matter to check, that the objects

(g) = ij(g) ti  tj = bki(g) a j

k (g) ti  tj

and

(g) = ij(g)t i  t j = bki(g)ak

j(g)t i  t j

(34)

(35)

dene respectively the poisson-lie structures on the groups g and g [14].
this means, that the conditions (25),(26) and (27) and their dual analogues
are veried. the bivectors (34) and (35) are called the lws poisson-lie
structures.

the existence of the global decomposition (18) enables us to dene a
natural left action of the group g on its dual g = an which is called the
dressing action ([12, 14, 15, 11]). an element g  g acts on g  g as follows
(36)

g g = p (gg1),

where p is the map from gc onto g induced by the iwasawa decomposition
(18). it is easy to verify that, indeed, (36) denes an action of g i.e.

(g1g2)g = g1( g2 g).

(37)

there is a useful formula which claries the relation between the dressing
transformation (36) and the poisson-lie structure  on g. indeed, the in-
nitesimal action of an element  = it i  g on a function f (g) is given
by
(38)

f (g) = ij(g)j if (g)  (

g )i if (g).

the fact that this is really an action, i.e.

[, ]f (g) = [,]f (g)

(39)

follows from the (dual of the) jacobi identity (26) and from (the innitesimal
version of) the cocycle condition (27):
k  f

k ij(g) = f ij

lj(g) + f

li(g).

(40)

before proceeding further, let us study a limit h  0. we x a basis t i
in g. then it is clear that in the limit h  0 the commutators of the dual
generators ti  g tend to zero and g becomes an abelian group isomorphic

9

to g.
in the same sense, the lie algebra gc becomes isomorphic to the
semidirect sum of g and g, where g acts on g in the coadjoint way. the
dressing action (36) becomes the standard coadjoint action of g on g in this
limit, the poisson-lie structure (g) vanishes (clearly, (g) is proportional
to h). moreover, the poisson-lie structure (g) becomes nothing but the
standard linear kirillov poisson bracket on g. we conclude, that the limit
h  0 corresponds to the previously considered case of the cotangent bundle
t g as the double d(g). hence our poisson-lie yang-mills theory (2) on
the lws double gc is a 1-parameter deformation of the standard yang-mills
theory (9). its action reads

s(l, 10, 01) =

1

2 z

i(l)+

[h+ll1, 10ihh01, l1lihhl01l1, 10ih]+

tr(ll1).
(41)
note that we have set all but one i in (2) to zero, and we have chosen
canonically the biinvariant term oi(l) where tr is the trace in the adjoint
representation. with an isotropic gauge choice
l = p (l) = g  g,

(42)



2h2 z

the action of the poisson-lie yang-mills theory (41) for gc becomes

s(g, 10, 01) =

1

2 z [h+gg1, 10ih h01, g1gih h01, g110gih] +

moreover, if we set  = 0 and dene



2h2 z tr(gg  1).

(43)

i t i  a j

(44)

then we have (43) as

1

s(g, a10, a01) =

2 z [hg1+g, a10ih  ha01, g1gih  (g)(a01, a10)],
(45)
where (g) is the lws poisson-lie structure (34). introduce a dierential
form a,

a  a10 + a01,

10

(46)

then we can rewrite (45) as

s(g, a) = 

1

2 z [ha , g1dgih +

1
2

(g)(a , a)].

(47)

this is precisely the poisson -model (1) (written in the left-invariant frame)
for the poisson-lie group manifold g. of course, we could introduce some
coordinates x i and write (47) directly in the form (1). we conclude that
for the vanishing coupling constant  = 0, the poisson-lie yang-mills theory
gives the poisson -model.

the gauge xing (42) is only partial, the residual group of gauge symme-
try (5) consists of the dressing gauge transformations by elements k(+, ) 
g:
(48)

g  kg,

a01  ka01k1  +kk1,

(49)

a10  k[a10  ((a10)

g + g1g)k]k1  kk1.

(50)
of course, k is dened in the dual way to (38), namely for w = w i ti  g
we have
(51)
in the limit h  0 the poisson-lie structure (k) vanishes and (50) becomes
the standard gauge transformation law like (11).
the reader may convince himself, that the prescription (48)-(50) denes
indeed the action of the gauge group on the triple of the elds (g, a10, a01).
she or he may also directly check the gauge invariance of the action (43) or
(47) with respect to the gauge transformation (48)-(50).

w k = (w k)it i  ij(k)w jt i.

innitesimal version of the transformations (48)-(50) is given by (38) and

by

(52)

(53)

the transformation (38) is the same as in [5] for the case of the poisson-lie
groups, but (52) and (53) are dierent. this is actually an interesting issue.
ikeda[3], schaller&strobl [4] and cattaneo&felder [5] have remarked a gauge
symmetry of the poisson -models that closes only on shell if the poisson
structure is not linearly dependent on the coordinates x i. the absence of
the o shell closure then requires to use the batalin-vilkovisky quantization.

11

our gauge symmetry (38), which together with (49) and (50) closes even o-
shell, acts in the same way on the poisson manifold as the one in [5]. it is due
to this fact that we nd plausible to conjecture that the kontsevich formula
can be derived by the standard faddeev-popov procedure in the special case
of the poisson-lie structures.

as an example, consider the double sl(2, c) of su(2). we choose the

basis of su(2) as

t j =

i
2

j,

where j are the pauli matrices, and the dual basis of g as

(58)

the parameter  is the coupling constant. clearly, for h  0 we recover the
ordinary su(2) yang-mills theory, because the terms in the square brackets
in the second and third lines of (57) become respectively x 3 and (x 3)2 + xx
in this limit. if the coupling constant  vanishes, (57) gives the poisson -
model which is the h-deformation of the bf theory.

explicitely, because the corresponding formulas are cumbersome and not too

much of what we said in this section about the lws doubles remains
true in a more general situation. actually, if the double of a lie group g
is a drinfeld double d, it follows that it exists the dual group g which is
also the isotropic subgroup of d. if, moreover, every element l  d can be
unambiguously represented as

l = kk,

k  g, k  g

(65)
and the induced map d  g  g is a dieomorphism, then the poisson-lie
structures on the groups g and g are again given by the expressions (34)
and (35). of course, one uses the invariant bilinear form that corresponds to
the double in question. the poisson-lie yang-mills theory, with the gauge
group based on g, corresponding to the double d and with the vanishing
coupling constant, is then again given by the poisson -model (47) where 
is the poisson-lie structure on g.

4 the partition function

the partition function of the ordinary euclidean yang-mills theory has been
computed by many methods [1, 2, 16, 17, 18, 19]. here we shall calculate
this quantity for the lws deformation of the yang-mills theory introduced
in the previous section. we use an appropriate generalization of the method
of blau and thompson [2, 8].

4.1 the wick rotation

the denition of an euclidean version of the poisson-lie yang-mills theory
(2) requires some care. the reason is the chiral gauge symmetry (5). if we
naively replace  by z and + by z we cannot view the elements zgg1
and zkk1 as elements of g because they are actually the elements of gc.
this suggests that the elds 10 and 01 are also independent elements of
gc. this would change, however, the number of degrees of freedom of our
theory. we may try to use the standard prescription in gauge theory, namely,
take 10 and 01 in gc and declare 01 to be an anti-hermitian conjugate of
10. this would balance the correct number of degrees of freedom but the
independent chiral gauge transformations (5) of 10 and 01 would not respect
such a constraint.

the way out of the trouble is a partial gauge xing. we see in the
examples (9) and (14) that we can partially x the gauge (11) or (16) in such
a way that the residual gauge symmetry acts in the same way on 10 and 01.
this makes possible to take 10 as the anti-hermitian conjugate of 10 and
indeed this is the standard way how the ordinary yang-mills theory and the
gauged g/g model are put on the riemann surface.

unfortunately, the gauge xing (42) in the lws case still leads to the
residual gauge symmetry (49) and (50) which acts dierently on 10 and 01
(or, rather, on a10 and a01). we can consider, however, another gauge xing
which does make possible to dene the euclidean version of the theory2. it
uses the cartan decomposition [20] of the group gc which says that every

2the reason why we did not consider immediately this new gauge xing is simple: we
wanted to make link to the poisson -model (1) that underlies the kontsevich formula
and this link was explicit in the gauge (42).

14

element l  gc can be represented as

l = pg,

(66)

where g  g and p  p . this decomposition is unique. here our notation is
standard; if we consider the set of the hermitian elements of gc (cf. footnote
1), we have p  ig and
(67)

p = expp.

the exponential mapping in (67) is one-to-one.

all this makes possible to choose conveniently the new gauge xing as

(68)
where the map p : gc  p is induced by the cartan decomposition (xy).
the residual gauge symmetry (5) in this gauge becomes

l = p (l) = p  p,

10  k10k1  kk1,

p  kpk1,
k  g.
(69)
now it is straightforward to write the euclidean version of the poisson-lie
yang-mills theory (41) in the gauge (68):

01  k01k1  +kk1,

se(p, 10, 01, , h) = ie(p)+

[h pp1, 10ih  h01, p1pih  hp01p1, 10ih] +



2h2 zg

2 zg

where

ie(p) =

i

4 zgh pp1, pp1ih +

i

24 zg

d1hdpp1, [dpp1, dpp1]ih. (71)

the gauge symmetry is given by the following transformations

p  kpk1,

10  k10k1  kk1,

01  k01k1  kk1.

(72)

remark that we use in (70) and (71) the language of dierential forms though
we do not indicate explicitly the wedge products between the forms. the
operators  and  are the dolbeault coboundary operators with respect to
the chosen complex structure on the riemann surface g (g indicates the
genus of the surface). the forms 10 and 01 are respectively the (1, 0) and

15

(0, 1) forms in the dolbeault complex and the form 10+01 is in gt g and
is interpreted as a connection on the (for the simply connected g necessarily)
trivial g bundle over g. in particular, it means that

01 = (10).

(73)

in other words, 10 is the anti-hermitian conjugate of 01, where the operation
 is the hermition conjugation on gc tensored with the complex conjugation
on t cg. note that only the term proportional to the coupling constant 
depends on the measure on the riemann surface, which itself is normalized
as

 = 1.

(74)

zg

the reader should avoid a pitfall in understanding the formula (70). it
has to do with the fact that the lws double dlw s of the compact simple
connected and simply connected group g is isomorphic to the complexi-
cation gc of g. for the purpose of dening the euclidean version of the
poisson-lie yang-mills theory, we have declared the 1-forms 10 and 01 to
be the elements of gc, hence seemingly to be the elements of the lie algebra
of the double. in fact, it is indeed correct to say that in the euclidean version
10 and 01 are the elements of a complexication of the lie algebra g, but it
is not correct to interpret 10 and 01 as the elements of the lie algebra dlws
of the double. the solution of this apparent paradox is that two dif f erent
(though mathematically isomorphic) complexications of g play role here.
in order to disentangle the two dierent complexications, let us work
from the very beginning with the real group dlw s as if we did not know
that it can be identied with the complexication of g. then consider the
complexied group dc
lws. upon the complexica-
lws, the subalgebra g  dlws gets complexied to (gc).
tion of dlws to dc
we indicate by  that this complexication is not the same as the complex-
ication gc = dlws. in fact, the forms 10 and 01 are to be understood as
the elements of (gc) in full agreement with the euclidean treatment of the
coset models (cf. [21]). of course, the invariant bilinear form h., .ih on dlws
gets extended onto dc

lw s and its lie algebra dc

lws by bilinearity (not sesquilinearity!).

16

4.2 the measure of the path integral

we now wish to quantize the theory (70). it actually resembles (the gauging
of) the wznw model on the symmetric space p as dened in [21]. the dif-
ference is, however, that there the killing-cartan form b(., .) was used while
3. the two models have nev-
we are using the invariant bilinear form h., .ih
ertheless some common features. they live both on the symmetric space p
which is a contractible manifold dieomorphic to the euclidean space rdimg.
this fact means that the d1 of the wznw 3-form (based on whatever in-
variant nondegenerate bilinear form) does exist globally. as the consequence,
we do not have to extend the map g  p to a 3-manifold, whose boundary
is g, if we want to determine the contribution of the wznw-term. hence
the level of the wznw model (which is equal to 1/h in our case) does not
get quantized and it can be an arbitrary positive real number.

we also note that the gauge symmetry (72) is diagonal and hence it is
not anomalous. by the way, also the chiral symmetries (5) of the original
poisson-lie yang-mills theory (2) are not anomalous since the lie algebra g
is isotropic. we may interpret it by saying that also at the quantum level the
theory (70) is the gauge xed version of the poisson-lie yang-mills theory
(41).

the partition function of the model (70) on the genus g riemann surface

is given by the following path integral.

z(, h, g) =

1

v ol(gg) z (dpd10d01)g exp se(p, 10, 01, , h),

(75)

where the action se is explicitly written in (70) and v ol(gg) is the volume
of the gauge group. it is natural to expect that the g-invariant measures
(d10d01)g and (dp)g should be based on the bilinear form h., .ih that
underlies the model (41) or (70). on the other hand, there appears an
immediate trouble in using h., .ih for dening the measure on the elds 10
and 01; indeed, these elds are isotropic with respect to h., .ih, hence it is
not clear how to build up a non-zero norm on the eld space.
we can circumvent the trouble by borrowing some inspiration from the
lie group theory. the standard measure on a simple complex group gc is
3for example, our wznw action ie(a) vanishes for a  a which is not the case in

[21].

17

only indirectly dened by the killing-cartan form b(., .) on gc. actually,
people dene another g-invariant bilinear form [22] as follows

k(x, y ) = b(x , y ), x, y  gc,

(76)

where we remind that  means the hermitian conjugation in gc. equipped
with the form k(., .), the lie algebra gc becomes an euclidean space. by
left transport of this euclidean form from the origin of the group manifold
gc everywhere, the riemannian metric and, hence, the riemannian measure
on gc is canonically dened. the reason4 for such a construction is simple.
with the choice of the positive denite bilinear form k(., .), a standartly
k-normalized measure is dened at the same time also for all lie subgroups
of gc.

in our case, there also exists the g-invariant way of turning the bilinear
form h., .ih into a positive denite bilinear form on gc. for this and also
for further purposes it is convenient to x canonically a real basis of the lie
algebra dlws:

dlws = spanr(r, j , k j, r, j, kj),

(77)

where

r =

1
2

(e + e),

j  = i
2

(e  e), k j =

i2hj

b(hj , hj )

;

(78)

r = ih
2

(e + e),

j = h
2

(e  e),

kj = hhj .

(79)

here our conventions and normalizations are the same as in [23]. this means,
in particular,

b(e, e) = 1, e

 = e,

[e, e] = h;

(80)

[h, e] = (h)e, (h) = b(h, h),

(81)
where h is an arbitrary element of the cartan subalgebra t ,js are the
simple roots and js the fundamental weights. we recognize in ik js the
simple coroots to which the fundamental weights js are dual.
note that the (anti-hermitian) capital generators r, j , k j generate
the compact real form g of dlws. the small generators r, j, kj do not

4we are indebted to p. delorme for this explanation.

18

generate a lie subalgebra of dlws but they span the vector subspace in dlws
that coincides with p (cf. the discussion between eqs.(66) ,and (67)). the
commutation relations of the elements of the basis (xy) give rise to real
structure constants thus they dene the real lie algebra dlws. in this basis,
the invariant bilinear form h., .ih is given as follows

hr, rih = 
 ,

hj , jih = 
 ,

hk i, kjih = i
j,

(82)

and all other inner products vanish. thus we see that small generators are
in some sense dual to the capital ones, but this decomposition does not give
rise to a manin triple because p is not a lie algebra.
consider an r-linear ip map , 2 = 1, dened by changing the capital
character into the small one in the canonical basis (77) (e.g. (r) = r).
then we dene the g-invariant positive denite bilinear form kh(., .) as
follows

(83)
note the similarity between (76) and (83);  is the analog of  in (76). a 2n-
dimensional euclidean volume form ddlws on the lie algebra dlws, originating
from kh(., .), is given by

kh(x, y )  h(x), y ih.

ddlws = ( ^+

(dr  dj ))  (^j

dk j)  ( ^+
 dt   dt  da  da.

(dr  dj))  (^j

dkj)

(84)

here dr, dj , dk j, dr, dj, dkj is by denition the dual basis (of the dual
space of the lie algebra dlws) with respect to the kh-orthonormal basis
r, j , k j, r, j, kj. we use the symbol kh, because the volume form on
dlws computed from kh(., .) diers the volume form coming from k(., .) by
a factor c(g)hdim g, where c(g) is an h-independent constant.
a measure on the gauge elds  = 10 +01 coming from kh(., .) is dened
by an inner product on the tangent space at each point of the connection
space :

(1, 2) =

kh(1

, 2).

(85)

1

4 zg

it is independent on the point  in the connection space and is gauge invariant
by virtue of the g-invariance of the form kh. it can be easily checked that a

19

measure on  dened by k(., .) diers from our measure (85) by a constant
independent on h. this fact will play an important role in what follows.

by using kh(., .), we have landed (up to a normalization) on the same
volume form as the one standardly used in group theory.
it is also clear
that our measure on p will dier only by the normalization factor from the
standard measure on the symmetric space p [24, 25]. indeed, let us dene
this measure in the way useful also for further applications.

first of all we dene a volume form ddlw s on the 2n-dimensional group
manifold dlw s. we do that by the left transport of the lie algebra volume
form ddlws. thus (ddlw s)l at a point l  dlw s is now dened as

(ddlw s)l = l

l1ddlws,

(86)
where l
l1 is the pull-back of the form ddlws (dened in the unit element of
the group) by the left translation dieomorphism. note that the invariant
volume form ddlw s is thus canonically normalized by the bilinear form kh.
the measure dp on the symmetric space p = dlw s/g is the most simply
dened in the following way: consider the projection map p : dlw s 
p dened in (68).then the integral of an arbitrary function with compact
support f (p) on p is dened by the prescription

z f (p)dp 

1

v ol(g) z ( p f )(l)ddlw s,

(87)

where p f is the pull-back of the function f by the projection map p and
v ol(g) is the volume of the compact group g. of course, the measure on the
subgroup g  dlw s is also standartly kh-normalized hence it makes sense
to speak about the volume of g. in fact, we can readily write the volume
form dg on g, it is given by

(dg)g = l

g1[dt   dt ].

(88)

we nish this subsection by noting that the measure (dp)g of the path
integral (75) is given by the riemann surface point-wise product of the mea-
sures (87).

4.3 the generalized weyl integral formula

our strategy for computing (75) will be similar as in [2, 8]. it means that we
shall rst abelianize the theory by nding a generalized version of the weyl

20

integral formula and then we shall compute the abelian partition function
in the standard way [2]. the non-abelian origin of the abelianized the-
ory will be remembered in the determinants produced by the abelianization
procedure.

it turns out that the generalization of the weyl integral formula, which
would work in our setting, indeed exists. it is given in [24] (p.186) and, in
more general setting and including the normalization, in [25]. this formula
is based on another form of the cartan decomposition which says that any
element l of gc can be (non uniquely) written as

l = gak1,

g, k  g,

a  a.

(89)

in particular, it follows from the cartan decomposition (66) that the elements
of p can be represented as

p = kak1,

k  g,

a  a.

(90)

the ambiguity of this representation of p is clearly parametrized by the ele-
ments of the normalizer of a in g; we denote this group as ng(a). evidently,
there is a normal subgroup zg(a)  ng(a) containing the elements of g
which commute with a. this subgroup is called the centralizer of a in
g and in our case it coincides with the maximal torus t of g. from the
fact that expt = t and exp it = a, we conclude that the quotient group
ng(a)/zg(a) is nothing but the weyl group of gc. thus the decomposition
(90) is unique if we view k as a class in g/t and a as an element of a+. here
a+ = exp a+ and a+ is the fundamental domain (=the weyl chambre) of
the action of the weyl group on a = it . for this unique parametrization
of p , we can infer the generalized weyl integral formula [24, 25] which holds
for the functions satisfying

it reads

where

f (p) = f (kpk1),

k  g.

f (p)dp =

(94)

(95)

the set of all roots of gc is denoted as , the set of positive roots as +. the
measure da is the standard measure on a  dlw s in the sense discussed
above; it is given by the kh-normalized volume form

(da)a = l

a1da.

(96)

the volume vol(g) is computed with respect to the standard measure dg,
dened in (88), and vol(t ) with respect to

(dt )t = l

t1dt ,

t  t.

(97)

the formula (95) gives the jacobian j(); for h = 1 it coincides with the
jacobian in [24, 25]. note that the limit h  0 makes sense and it produces
the jacobian which arises in the weyl integral formula for the lie algebra
g [2]. in what follows, we shall use a notation often used in the world of
quantum groups; i.e.

[x]h =

(98)

sinhhx

h

for an arbitrary number x. with this notation, the jacobian j() becomes
the product of the q-numbers:

j() = +[()]2
h.

(99)

let us now give the proof of (95). it is clear that the integral r f (p)dp in

the l.h.s. of (92) reduces to some integral over a+ since both the function f (p)
and the measure dp are invariant with respect to the conjugation by elements
of g (the latter fact follows from the simultaneous left and right g-invariance
of ddlw s). it is not dicult to nd the volume form corresponding to this
integration. for this, dene rst a map a+ : p  a+ that associates to every
p  p the element a  a+ under the cartan decomposition (90). clearly,

22

the function f (p) on p satisfying (91) is the pull-back of some function f (a)
on a+ by the map a+. we are looking for a function j(a) such that

z f (a)j(a)da+ =

1

vol(g)vol(g/t ) z ( p  a

+

f )(l)ddlw s.

(100)

here vol(g/t ) is calculated from the measure on the homogeneous space
g/t dened in a similar way as the measure on dlw s/g (cf.(87)). it then
follows

vol(g/t ) =

we see from (100) that

a realizes the right action of the generator j  of g on the group

the left action of t  on dlw s at the same point a. clearly, iv  denotes the
insertion of the multivector v into the form . every such a generator, say
rj

(105)

where la is the push-forward map corresponding to the left transport. in a
similar way, we have

note that the term ie(p = a) in (70) gives no contribution to (112).
this seems to be a trivial fact because a is commutative and isotropic with
respect to h., .ih. however, the isotropy and commutativity together with
the cohomological triviality of the wznw term explains the vanishing of
ie(a). in the case of the g/g gauged wznw model the wznw term is

24

not cohomologically trivial and it may and does contribute [2, 27]. this
can be easily understood by realizing that in the cohomologically nontrivial
situation one has to consider the mappings extended to three-dimensional
domain of which g is the boundary. this extension need not respect the
(isotropic and/or commutative) gauge choice on g.

our formula (112) almost coincides with the result of the abelianization
of the ordinary yang-mills theory (formula (2.58) of [2]). up to a trivial over-
all 2 normalization5, the only dierence in the action consists in replacing
the ordinary numbers () of blau and thompson by our quantum num-
bers [()]h. moreover, the measure of our path integral diers from that
of the ordinary yang-mills case only by an h-independent constant. this
constant originates from the dierence between our measure-dening form
kh(., .) and the ordinary yang-mills measure-dening form k(., .), where
the h-dependent part of this dierence is already taken into account in the
jacobian j() or, in other words, in the ghost part of the action. more-
over, also the 2 renormalization of the measure of the gauge elds play role
(cf. our eq.(85) and eq.(2.11) of [2]). we shall eventually use a freedom
to renormalize our measure-dening bilinear form by all these h-independent
constants in such a way that the limit h  0 in (112) gives a correctly
normalized ordinary yang-mills partition function.
there is a very important aspect of exploiting the (generalized) weyl
integral formula in the ordinary yang-mills case [2] and also in our poisson-
lie yang-mills setting. it has to do with the following fact: the validity of
the cartan decomposition (90) of an arbitrary element p  p does not imply
that the smooth mapping p(z, z) : g  p can be smoothly decomposed as
(115)

p(z, z) = g(z, z)a(z, z)g(z, z)1,

g(z, z)  g,

a(z, z)  a+.

of course, the mappings g(z, z) and a(z, z) do exist but it is by no means
guaranteed that they be smooth. this fact has serious implications for the
proper meaning of the formula (112). strictly speaking, we cannot choose
the gauge (111) smoothly. then what do we mean by eq. (112)?

a hard work of blau and thompson [8] was needed for solving this prob-
lem in the case of the ordinary yang-mills theory (and also in the case of
the g/g gauged wznw model). fortunately, we can fully rely on their

5blau and thompson have chosen the overall normalization to be in accord with the

xed point theorems while we are using the standard wznw normalization.

25

results also in the lws case because p is dieomorphic to the lie algebra g
of g and this (exponential) dieomorphism commute with conjugations by
the elements of g. in fact, we have

p = exp ig.

(116)

this means that we map p(z, z)  p into g by taking the inverse of the
mapping (116) and then we apply the blau-thompson diagonalization i.e.

 ilnp(z, z) = g(z, z)t(z, z)g1(z, z),

t(z, z)  c+  t .

(117)

here c+ = ia+ is the weyl chamber in t . by multiplying (117) by i and
then exponentiating, we arrive at the seeken cartan decomposition

p(z, z) = g(z, z)a(z, z)g1(z, z),

a(z, z) = eit(z,z)  a+.

(118)

the analysis [8] of the diagonalization of the type (117) can be translated
into our context along the lines above and it gives the following results: if
lnp(z, z) is a smooth map from the riemann surface g into a subset of
regular elements of g then
1) the smooth decomposition (115) can always be achieved locally on g.
2) the diagonalized map a(z, z) can always be chosen to be smooth globally.
3) non-trivial t -bundles on g are the obstructions to nding smooth func-
tions g(z, z) globally. in particular, if there are no nontrivial principal g-
bundles on g (like in our case), all isomorphism classes of torus bundles
appear as obstructions.
4) the gauge eld path integral should include a sum over the t -connections
on all isomorphism classes of t -bundles on g.

actually, the point 4) shows in which sense we should understand the formula
(112).

it is not so dicult to understand intuitively, what is going on here. if the
function g(z, z) is not smooth somewhere, then passing from p(z, z) to a(z, z)
is a singular gauge transformation and the g(z, z)-transformed connection
eld  becomes singular. it is well-known that singular connections can be
sometimes interpreted as connections on nontrivial bundles (see [2, 26] for
examples).

26

the condition that ilnp(z, z) is a regular element of the lie algebra g
may seem inconspicuous but it is in fact crucial for the proper denition of
the path integral. by restricting our space of elds p(z, z) to those verifying
the condition of the regularity, we make a certain choice. we can certainly
understand it simply as a part of a plausible def inition of the path integral,
because, as it was shown in [8] such regular maps with values in the lie alge-
bra g are generic. in order to corroborate this choice we give two arguments
(a more detailed discussion is provided in [2, 8] and it is directly relevant also
to our poisson-lie yang-mills case):

first of all, the restriction to the regular maps gives the correct answer
for the ordinary yang-mills case, which is conrmed by alternative methods
of calculation [1, 16, 17, 18, 19]. secondly, the non-regular s are anyway
automatically suppressed from the path integral since the jacobian j(),
originating from the generalized weyl integral formula, vanishes for them.
indeed, the jacobian j() vanishes if and only if i is not a regular element
of t . this can be seen directly from the denition of the regularity; an
element x of the cartan subalgebra t is regular i it satises a condition
dett (ad(x)) 6= 0 where the notation means that the ad(x) operator is
restricted to t . of course, if this ad(x) determinant vanishes then there
exists a root  such that (x) = 0. the latter fact implies the vanishing of
the jacobian j(x). the opposite direction can be also easily proved.

following closely [2], we shall now perform the path integral over the
ane space of abelian connections aj. the maximal torus bundles are
parametrized by the monopole numbers (n1, . . . , nrankg) given by

fj(a) = 2nj,

zg

(119)

where a = ajk j is a connection on the bundle and f (a) = fj(a)k j is its
curvature. for each set of the monopole numbers we choose one connection
acl which we call the classical monopole solution. it fulls

dacl = 2njk j.

now every connection a can be written as

a = acl + aq,

27

(120)

(121)

where the quantum part aq of the connection is a 1-form on g with values
in t . the path integral over a then becomes the sum over the monopole
numbers and the path integral over aq. the latter imposes a constraint

d = 0.

(122)

the details of this procedure which, of course, must be accompanied by
an appropriate gauge xing and ghost integration are presented in [2] eqs.
(2.71)-(2.80). their calculation applies to our case without any change. thus
the integral over  reduces to a nite integral over the constant mode of  and
we shall note the corresponding measure d instead of d. of course, the
integral over d is taken over the (interior of the) weyl chamber a+ = ic+.
the result is

z(, h, g) = z (ddbdcdcrdcj) exp x
exp{injj 

2 zg x+

i

xn1,...,nrankg

[()]2
h

([()]hb  c + [()]2
hcr

cj

)}.
(123)

here we have also used eq. (74).

the path integral over the b,c elds and over the ghosts was performed
in [2] in generality, which covers not only the ordinary yang-mills and the
g/g gauged wznw case but also our poisson-lie yang-mills case. the
functions m dened in eq. (b.5) of [2] are in our context m = [()]h.
we infer from (b.23) of [2] that

z(, h, g) = z d(+[()]h)22g xn1,...,nrankg

h}.
(124)
contrary to the g/g case and in accord with the ordinary yang-mills theory,
there is no shift of a level 1/h. the last step of calculation consists in
performing the d integral. we use the well-known formula

exp {injj   x

[()]2

1

2 xnj

einj j

= xmj

(j  2mj).

(125)

here on the right-hand-side we recognize the periodic  function. the usual
2 factor in this formula is understood to be hidden in the denition of the

28

measure d. substituting the expression (125) into (124), we arrive at

z(, h, g) =

1

|w| xm1,...,mrankg

(+[2mj(hj )]h)22g exp  x

[2mj(hj )]2

h. (126)

note that here we have conveniently extended the domain of denition of 
from a+ to whole a and we compensated this by factoring the volume |w|
of the weyl group. we now interpret the summation over mj as summation
over the weight lattice of g. the latter is dened as

 = z[1, . . . , r],

(127)

where r = rankg and i are the fundamental weights. we set  = mjj and
we rewrite (126) as

z(, h, g) =

1

|w| x+r

+([b(, +)]2h)22g exp  x

[b(,  + )]2

2h.

(128)

2 p+  = pj j. since we anyway

note the shift by the weyl vector  = 1
sum up over the whole weight lattice, this shift can be interpreted as a pure
change of the summation variable. another important remark concerns the
notation r in (128). by this we mean that we sum only over the regular
points of the weight lattice in accord with the discussion above. there is a
simple criterion to decide whether an element of the weight lattice is regular
or not. in fact, the non-regular elements are precisely those which are located
on the walls of the weyl chambers.

the formula (128) is our nal result for the partition function of the
lws poisson-lie yang-mills theory, or for  = 0, of the poisson -model
corresponding to the lws poisson-lie structure on g = an. we see that,
indeed, we can interpret this partition function as the series over the q-
numbers. in the limit h  0, our result agrees with the ordinary yang-mills
partition function eq. (2.86) of [2]. to see this, we just have to use the
well-known identity [23]

b(x, y) = x

b(x, )b(, y),

x, y  g

(129)

for x = y =  + .

29

4.5 the verlinde formula

let us rewrite our formula (128) for the partition function z(, h, g) for the
case  = 0:

z( = 0, q, g) =

1
|w|

a1g x+r

|1  q(,+)|1g.

(130)

here q = exp 2hb(, ), a is a normalization constant to be discussed
later and the bilinear form (.,.) on the dual of t is dened by the following
rescaling of the killing-cartan form:

(x, y ) =

2

b(, )

b(x, y ).

(131)

here  denotes the longest root.

in our construction, q was a real parameter, nevertheless, we shall now
consider z(0, q, g) as a function of a complex q. strictly speaking, if q is
complex, we cannot say apriori whether z(0, q, g) is a partition function
of some theory. we shall see, however, that for q being a root of unity,
z(0, q, g) can be (almost) interpreted as the partition function of the g/g
gauged wznw model. as it is well-known, the latter is given by the verlinde
formula [7] which is a f inite sum and not a series. in which sense can we say
that our series (130) gives the verlinde formula for q being a root of unity?
the point is that for q equal to a root of unity, say qk = 1, the expression
under the summation symbol in (130) acquires the ane weyl symmetry.
the ane weyl group [28] is a semidirect product of the standard weyl
group and of the coroot lattice. the action of the weyl group on the weight
lattice is standard and since the product  in (130) is taken over all roots,
the expression (130) is weyl invariant (this follows from an idempotency
and killing-cartan orthogonality of weyl reections). an element  of the
coroot lattice acts on the weight lattice as

 =  + k

1
2

b(, )b(, .) =  + k(, .).

(132)

here use the symbol (., .) for the form on t dual to (., .).
recall that for a root , the coroot   t is dened by

 =

2h

b(, )

.

30

(133)

the ane weyl symmetry of (130) for qk = 1 is now obvious because

q(, ) = q(,)+k() = q(,).

(134)

the last equality follows from the fact that () is integer, as the result of
the contraction of  (which is also an element of the weight lattice) with the
coroot . actually, for qk = 1, the expression (130) makes sense only if the
weights lying on ane weyl orbits of the non-regular weights are excluded
from r. it is precisely in this sense that we understand (130).

we conclude that, for qk = 1, the series (130) can be written as a summa-
tion over the fundamental domain of the ane weyl group multiplied by its
(innite) volume. it is because of this innite volume renormalization that
we have said above that z(0, q, g) can be almost interpreted as the partition
function of the g/g gauged wznw model. the fundamental domain of the
action of the ane weyl group is often referred to as the (weyl) alcove and
it contains those elements  of the standard weyl chamber that full

() < k.

(135)

here  is the coroot of the longest root. for g = su(r + 1), the condition
(135) translates into

r

mj < k, mj > 0,

xj=1

(136)

eq. (130) with the summation restricted to the alcove is nothing but the
verlinde formula. its correct normalization can be achieved by adding to the

where  = pj mjj are the dominant weights sweeping the weyl chamber.
action (70) a suitable counterterm of the form constrg r, where r is the

curvature on the riemann surface.

as we have already remarked, it is not clear from our derivation whether
z(0, q, g) is a partition function of some theory if q is not real. on the other
hand, the result for q equal to a root of unity suggests that it is indeed so
because the partition function of the g/g gauged wznw model is given by
the verlinde formula. it might be that this fact is related to an observation
made by alekseev, schaller and strobl [29]. they remarked that, modulo
some -function relict of the wznw term, the g/g gauged wznw model
can be represented as the poisson -model where the poisson structure on g
is a complex bivector. if q and, hence, h has a non-vanishing imaginary part

31

then in our context the real poisson bivector (g) gets rescaled by a complex
planck constant h and it becomes complex too. however, there is a crucial
dierence between our theory and that of alekseev et al. our lws poisson
-model (or the poisson-lie yang-mills theory with the vanishing coupling
constant) lives on the dual group g = an while the poisson -model of [29]
lives on the compact group g.
inspite of this, the partition functions for
particular qs happen to coincide! this suggests that a sort of a quantum
poisson-lie t-duality [13, 30] between the two topological -models takes
place here.

5 outlook

an open eld for future investigations is the study of the correlation func-
tions of the poisson-lie yang-mills theories. it seems to be very plausible
that, like in the ordinary yang-mills case, one can identify observables whose
correlators are insertion independent. it would be also interesting to calcu-
late exactly the three-point boundary correlator of the lws poisson -model
on the disc. it is known [5] that the perturbation expansion in h gives the
kontsevich formula. if this correlator can be computed by a closed formula,
we might attempt to consider a convergence in h. thus h would make sense
not only as the formal expansion parameter.

a more algebraic problem consists in attempting a classication of all
doubles d(g) of a connected simple compact group g. this would lead to a
generalization of the classication [31] of the poisson-lie structures on g.

the verlinde formula was recently associated to the quantum double of
a nite group [32]. although we have dealt with with the classical double of
a lie group, it would be certainly worth looking at possible relations of the
two constructions.

it would be desirable to produce a derivation of the partition function
by an alternative method. for example, the gluing and pasting procedure
of [16]. it may seem problematic to use this approach because of problems
with the denition of the wznw action on surfaces with boundaries. on the
other hand we note that in the lws poisson-lie yang-mills case the wznw
term is cohomologically trivial therefore this problem should be accessible.
of course, this last remark is pertinent also for the very denition of the
poisson-lie yang-mills theory on the riemann surfaces with boundary and

32

for the implications concerning the kontsevich formula.
