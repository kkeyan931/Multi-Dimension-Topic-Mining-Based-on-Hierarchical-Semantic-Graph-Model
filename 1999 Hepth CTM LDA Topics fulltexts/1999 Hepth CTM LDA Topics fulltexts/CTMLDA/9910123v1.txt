abstract

the algebraic structure and the relationships between the eigenspaces of

the calogero-sutherland model (csm) and the sutherland model (sm) on

a circle are investigated through the cherednik operators. we nd an exact

connection between the simultaneous non-symmetric eigenfunctions of the

an 1 cherednik operators, from which the eigenfunctions of the csm and sm

are constructed, and the monomials. this construction, not only, allows one to

write down a harmonic oscillator algebra involving the cherednik operators,

which yields the raising and lowering operators for both of these models, but

also shows the connection of the csm with free oscillators and the sm with

free particles on a circle. we also point out the subtle dierences between the

excitations of the csm and the sm.

i. introduction

exactly solvable and quantum integrable many-body hamiltonians with non-trivial po-

tentials are of great interest, since they lead to a deeper understanding of the role of in-

teraction in these models. among such systems, the calogero-sutherland model (csm)

[1,2] and its generalizations [3,4] enjoy a special status and have been found to be of rele-

vance in diverse branches of physics [5], such as the universal conductance uctuations in

mesoscopic systems [68], quantum hall eect [911], uid dynamics [12], random matrix

theory [2,5,13,14], fractional statistics [1517], anyons [1820], gravity [2123] and gauge

theories [24,25]. they describe n-identical particles in one-dimension with pair-wise inverse

distance-square long-range interactions. the csm is dened on the entire real line with or

without the harmonic connement, while the sutherland model (sm) [3] lives on a circle.

the underlying algebraic structure and the commuting conserved operators of these models

have been analyzed by the exchange operator formalism (eof) [26,27] and the quantum

lax formulation (qlf) [2832]. the eof makes use of the well-known dunkl operator [33].

both of these models share the same algebraic structure [2832,27]. the celebrated jack

polynomials [3437] arise as the polynomial part of the orthogonal basis for the sm and

their one parameter deformation, known as the hi-jack polynomials, plays the same role for

the csm. rodrigues-type formulae have been discovered for the jack [38] and the hi-jack

polynomials [39]. the sm is better understood as compared to the csm, since, its exact

density-density dynamical correlation functions have been computed [5,4043]. the eigen-

spectrum of the sm can be interpreted as arising from a set of free quasi-particles satisfying

the generalized exclusion principle [44,45].

yet another approach, towards the understanding of these correlated systems, is to map

them to the corresponding interaction-free systems. motivated by calogeros conjecture

[46], the present authors have shown that the csm is equivalent to a set of free harmonic

oscillators [47]. later, the same model without the harmonic connement was found to be

unitarily equivalent to free particles on the real line [48]; the corresponding eigenfunctions

2

can also be realized as coherent states [49]. recently, the present authors have developed a

general method, by which, a host of non-trivial interacting models can be mapped to non-

interacting systems [50]. this method treats both the csm and the sm on equal footing;

the former one is equivalent to decoupled harmonic oscillators and the later, to free particles

on a circle.

this paper is organized as follows. the following section deals with the algebraic struc-

ture and the relationships between the hilbert spaces of the csm and the sm, via the

cherednik operators [51]. the origin of two orthogonal basis sets of the csm, with two

dierent innerproducts, is clearly pointed out. in the subsequent section, we nd the exact

connection between the eigenfunctions of the cherednik operators and the non-symmetric

monomials. from this, the raising and lowering operators for the eigenfunctions of the csm

and the sm are constructed. subtle properties of these operators, with correlations built into

them, are pointed out and contrasted with the free oscillators raising and lowering operators.

we conclude in the nal section by pointing out the advantages of the present approach as

compared to the others in the literature and the future directions of work. the appendix

deals with the explicit derivation of the map, which is used to obtain the connection between

the eigenfunctions of the cherednik operators and the non-symmetric monomials.

ii. algebraic structure of the csm & sm, and the relationship

between their hilbert spaces

in the following, we rst touch upon some common aspects of both the csm and the

sm, since these are important for concluding the major results of the present paper.

in

particular, we show the equivalence of their underlying algebraic structure through the

cherednik operators; this naturally brings out the relationships of their respective hilbert

spaces.

as mentioned earlier, the qlf and the eof establish that, both the csm and the

sm share the same algebraic structure which becomes exactly the same in the limit   

3

[2732]. keeping this in mind and also the method developed to map the sm to free particles

[50], we begin with the n-particle csm hamiltonian, given by (h = m = 1),

hcsm =

xi,j=1

(xi  xj)2

,

(1)

where, i  /xi,  is the frequency of the oscillators and  > 1

2 is the coupling parameter.

the correlated ground-state of the hcsm is known to be of the form 0 = zg, where

i<j[|xi  xj|(xi  xj)] and g  exp{ 1

i }; here,  = 0 or 1 corresponds to the

quantization of the csm, as bosons or fermions, respectively. without any loss of generality,

2 pi x2

z  qn

we choose  = 0.

performing a division by  and a similarity transformation by t  zg exp{ 1

where a  [ 1

(xixj)i], eq. (1) can be brought to the following form [47],

i + pi6=j

hcsm  t 1(hcsm /) t = xi

xii +

2

n(n  1) +

n

,

(2)

(3)

which is independent of the parameter . using the following identity,

eq. (2) can be rewritten as

xi

(xi  xj)

=

1
2

xi,j

i6=j

n(n  1)

,

hcsm = xi

di +

1
2

n

,

where, di  di + (i  1)  pj<i(1  kij) is the well-known cherednik operator for the
an 1 root system [51,38,52]; here, di  xii, i  i + p

the dunkl derivative [33] and kij is the transposition or exchange operator [26,27,5356],

(xixj) (1  kij) is nothing but

1

j

whose action on an arbitrary state can be written as

kij|x1,    , xi,    , xj,    , xn >= |x1,    , xj,    , xi,    , xn >

.

it is easy to check that, the cherednik operators are in involution, i.e.,

[ di , dj] = 0 = [ hcsm , dk]

,

(4)

4

for any i, j, k = 1, 2, 3,    , n. henceforth, we follow ref. [38] for the notations and ref.

[36], for the denitions of symmetric functions, ordering of partitions, e.t.c., which are not

discussed explicitly in the present paper.

from eq. (4), it is clear that, by constructing the simultaneous eigenfunctions, , of

di:

di  = 

i 

,

(5)

and symmetrizing them, one recovers the eigenfunctions, j, of the hcsm :

j = xp



;

(p denotes the permutations)

.

a generic form of , for a given partition, of  can be expressed as,

 = m + x<

u m

,

where, the non-symmetric monomial function m = qi xi

in eq. (5), the eigenvalues 

i and us are some coecients.

are non-negative integers obeying the dominance ordering [36]. note that, the monomial

i = i + (n  1) and  = pi i;  = 0, 1, 2,    ,  and is
symmetric function is given by m = pp m. the inverse similarity transformation by t on

the eigenstates of hcsm yields the eigenfunctions of the original hcsm . at this moment, it

is important to note that, one can construct the following conserved operator [57,38,52]:

hsm  xi (cid:16) d2

i  (n  1) di(cid:17) +

1
6

n(n  1)(n  2)2

,

(6)

which, when restricted to act on the symmetric functions of the variables, xis, yields the

dierential equation for the jack polynomials [3437], and is nothing but the sutherland

hamiltonian [3] gauged away by the ground-state wavefunction. note that, in the sutherland

model, xj = exp{ 2ij

l }, where, j is the location of the j-th particle on the circle and l is

the length of the circumference.

since, both the hcsm and the hsm can be expressed in terms of the cherednik operators,

di, we also conclude that, these two models share the same algebraic structure [2832,27].

5

now, the symmetrized simultaneous eigenfunctions of the cherednik operators coincide with

the jack polynomials, because, [ hcsm , hsm ] = 0. therefore, the polynomial part of the

eigenfunctions of the hcsm , i.e., the hi-jack polynomials, j, can be expressed as,

j({xi}, , ) = e 1

2

a j({xi}, )

;

(7)

this is lassalles famous exponential formula [58,52]. an alternate derivation of the lassalles

formula has been earlier given by sogo [58].

it is interesting to note from eq. (2) that, akin to the cherednik operators, one can also

choose xii as the n commuting operators, whose simultaneous eigenfunctions are m with

eigenvalues i. by symmetrizing the ms, one obtains the monomial symmetric functions as

the eigenfunctions of the hcsm with eigenvalues pi i + 1

to the hi-jack polynomials, another set of eigenstates of the hcsm can be written as

2 n(n  1) + 1

2 n. hence, similar

p({xi}, , ) = e 1

2

a m({xi})

.

(8)

performing one more similarity transformation by exp{ 1

i } g1, hcsm can be mapped

4 pi 2

to a set of n free harmonic oscillators [47]. further, by the inverse transformation, one

can dene a+

i = t xi t 1 and a

i = t i t 1 as the creation and annihilation operators:

hi = a+

i a

i + 1

2(n  1) + 1

2, [a

i

, aj] = ij and [hi , a

j ] =  a

j ij. now, the hcsm can

be written completely in terms of the decoupled oscillators:

hcsm = xi

a+
i a

i +

1
2

n(n  1) +

1
2

n

.

(9)

it can be veried by a direct computation that, the hi-jack polynomials, j, form an or-

thogonal basis with respect to the conventional inner product, whereas the ps do not [58].

however, it is clear that, hcsm truly becomes a set of decoupled harmonic oscillators in the

p basis, but not in the j basis, since, ps can be obtained by the repeated applications

of the commuting creation operators, a+

i , on the ground-state. ps can be made orthogo-

nal by postulating a new inner product << | >= , where, << | =<< 0|m({a

i }),

| >= m({a+

i })|0 > and a

i |0 >= 0 =<< 0|a+

i , for i = 1, 2, 3,    , n [47]. explicit con-

struction of this new orthogonal basis was achieved in refs. [59].

iii. free harmonic oscillators and the jack polynomials

in the following, using the properties of the cherednik operators [51,38,52] and the

method developed to map the sutherland model to free particles [50], we obtain the jack

polynomials akin to the ps. the cherednik operators, along with certain creation and

annihilation operators, are found to obey the free harmonic oscillator algebra. however, as

one naturally expects, these operators, with correlations built into them, drastically dier

in their properties, when compared with the creation and the annihilation operators for the

monomial symmetric functions.

rewriting eq. (3) as,

(cid:16)xii  i + bi(cid:17)  = 0

,

(10)

where, bi  p

i

xi

(xixj) (1  kij)  pj<i(1  kij)  (n + 1  2i), the solution is found

to be (see the appendix for the proof),

 =

(1)n"



xn=0

 g m

bi#n

m

1

(xii  i)
.

(11)

it can be straightforwardly veried that, g is, indeed, independent of the particle index i, for

a given partition of . now, the jack polynomials can be obtained by simply symmetrizing

:

j = xp

 = xp

g m

.

(12)

comparing the above with an earlier derived formula for the jack polynomials [50],

j({xi}) =



xn=0

(xi<j

we get the following operator identity, satised by the monomial functions:

from eq. (10), it can be veried that

.

due to the above result, eq. (6) becomes,

.

hsm g = xi (cid:16)(xii)2 + (n  1)xii(cid:17) +

n(n  1)(n  2)2

.

(14)

eqs. (13) and (14) depict the equivalence of the csm to decoupled oscillators and the sm,

to free particles on a circle. this is yet another proof of their equivalences [47,50].

by the inverse transformation, the creation and annihilation operators for the jack poly-

nomials can be dened:

which satisfy,

b+
i, = gxig1


;

i, = gig1
b


,

(15)

di = b+

i,b

i, + (n  1)

and

[ di

,

b
j,] = b
j,

;

[b

i, , b+

j,] = ij

.

(16)

note that, b

j, crucially depend on a given partition of ; which, in turn, implies that, each

cherednik operator can be written in terms of an innite set of decoupled oscillators. the

ground and excited states can be obtained from,

b
i,|0 > = 0 for

i = 1, 2,    , n

and

yi

(b+

i,)i|0 > = | > with xi

i =  ,

(17)

respectively. however, all the states, | >, are not normalizable except those, for which

 = , i.e., | >.

recollecting the earlier mapping of the sm to free particles [50],

one can also dene another set of creation and annihilation operators for the jack polyno-

mials:

i, = gxi g1
c+



;

i, = gi g1
c



,

and

[c

i, ,

c+
j,] = ij

.

(19)

note that, c

i,s also depend on , but, unlike b

i,s, they are insensitive to the permuta-

tions of the particle coordinates.

in order to have the normalizable eigenstates, one has

to symmetrize the states created by the repeated application of c+

i,s on the ground-state

which depends on the  and is annihilated by c

i,s. this situation is analogous to the case

encountered earlier, when the csm is mapped to free harmonic oscillators [47,59]. keeping

this in mind, a generic state can be written as,

s, = m({c+

i,})s0,({xi})

,

(20)

where, ms are the monomial symmetric functions [36], s0,({xi}) = pp 0,({xi}) and

c
i,0,({xi}) = 0. it can be veried that, unlike the previous situation [47,59], all these

symmetrized states, s,, are still not normalizable, except those, for which  = . in this

case, s, coincides with the jack polynomial j, i.e., s, = j.

9

iv. conclusions

in conclusion, we have found a mapping between the eigenstates of the cherednik op-

erators and the non-symmetric monomials. this not only allows one to nd the common

algebraic structure of these two models, but also enables one to map the csm to free har-

monic oscillators and the sm to free particles on the circle. hence, both these models are

treated on equal footing. the earlier known method of generating jack polynomials used

the creation operators, which were not commuting ones, and have to be acted in a particular

order on the vacuum [38]. the present method does not suer from these diculties.

the excited states of the calogero-sutherland model (csm) and the sutherland model

(sm) can be thought to be arising from the excitations of an innite set of free harmonic

oscillators, labeled by the partitions of . in other words, from each set of harmonic oscilla-

tors labeled by the partitions of , one can construct an innite number of towers such that,

each tower contains an innite number of excited states bounded from below. however, from

each tower of these excited states, only one state survives as the normalizable one, which

belongs to the hilbert space. this rich structure needs further analysis, which is currently

under progress and will be reported elsewhere.

it worth pointing out again that the excited states of the csm can be interpreted in two

ways due to the presence of two dierent inner products [47,59]. in one case, they arise out

of the decoupled oscillators, where as in the other scenario, they originate from a correlated

system. for the sm, only the later interpretation seems to be valid.

finally, we would like to remark that, the present procedure can also be carried out

for the root systems, other than the an 1 [4]. extension of these analyses to the higher

dimensional models [6063] may provide new insights; particularly, in the context of the two-

dimensional systems, this may lead to a better understanding of some intriguing aspects of

the anyons [1820]. furthermore, this technique may also throw new light on the structure

of the supersymmetric versions of these model [65,66].

appendix

in the following, we connect the solutions of dierential equations, involving the dunkl

derivatives, to the monomials. for that purpose, we extend the proof given in ref. [50]

for ordinary dierential equations, to the equations involving dunkl derivatives. first, we

illustrate the procedure for the single variable case, and then extend it to the multivariable

scenario.

consider the most general and arbitrary linear dierential equation [50],

(cid:16)f (d) + p(cid:17) y(x) = 0 ,
n= andn, is a diagonal operator. p can be an arbitrary

(21)

where, d  x d

dx and f (d) = pn=

operator, having a well-dened action in the space spanned by xn. here, ans are some

parameters. the following ansatz,

y(x) = c(

f (d)

p#m) x

,

(22)

is a solution of the above equation, provided, f (d)x = 0 and the coecient of x in

y(x)  cx is zero (no summation over ); here, c is a constant. the later condition not

only guarantees that, the solutions, y(x)s, are non-singular, but also yields the eigenvalues.

substituting eq. (22), modulo c, in eq. (21),

note that, the detailed properties of p are not needed to prove eq. (22) as a solution of

eq. (21). however, naturally, they are required while constructing the explicit solutions of

any given linear dierential equation.

eq. (22), which connects the solutions of a dierential equation to the monomials, can

be generalized to many-variables as follows [50].

consider,

  
xn=

bn(xi

dn

i ) + a! q({xi}) = b({xi})

,

(24)

where, bns are some parameters, di  xii, a can be a function of xi, i and also some

other well-dened operators like the transposition operator kij and b({xi}) is a source

term.

case (i) when b({xi}) = 0 and am = m+p< cm; where, ms are the monomial

symmetric functions [36] and  and c are some coecients.

using eq. (22), the solutions can be obtained as,

q({xi}) =



(1)r"
xr=0
n= bn(pi n

with, p

case (ii) when b({xi}) 6= 0.

(26)

provided, the coecient of the divergent part in the right hand side of the above equation

is zero. as mentioned earlier, this requirement yields the eigenvalues.

as an example, consider the hypergeometric dierential equation [64],

 x(1  x)

d2
dx2 + [  ( +  + 1)x]

d
dx

 ! y(x) = 0

.

multiplying by x, the above can be written as,

(cid:16)d(d +   1) + a(cid:17) y(x) = 0 ,

(27)

(28)

where, d  x d

dx and a  xd(d +  + )  x. now, f (d)x = d(d +   1)x = 0 yields
 = 0 or 1  . from eq. (22), the two linearly independent solutions, y0(x) and y1(x),

can be written as,

y0(x) = c0( 
xm=0

(1)m"
a 1 ,

= c0 e

and

1

d+1

1

d(d +   1)

( a)#m) x0

y1(x) = c1 e(1/d) a x1

.

(29)

(30)

solutions for many other dierential equations, constructed by this method, can be

found in ref. [50]. further, this technique can be applied to the bound-state problems of

the schrodinger equations with complicated potentials. these details are also available in

the same reference.
