abstract

the newtonian character of gauge theories on a light front requires that the longitudinal
momentum p +, which plays the role of newtonian mass, be conserved. this requirement
conicts with the standard denition of the force between two sources in terms of the minimal
energy of quantum gauge elds in the presence of a quark and anti-quark pinned to points
separated by a distance r. we propose that, on a light front, the force be dened by minimizing
the energy of gauge elds in the presence of a quark and an anti-quark pinned to lines (1-branes)
oriented in the longitudinal direction singled out by the light front and separated by a transverse
distance r. such sources will have a limited 1+1 dimensional dynamics. we study this proposal
for weak coupling gauge theories by showing how it leads to the coulomb force law. for qcd
we also show how asymptotic freedom emerges by evaluating the s-matrix through one loop
for the scattering of a particle in the nc representation of color su (nc) on a 1-brane by a
particle in the nc representation of color on a parallel 1-brane separated from the rst by a
distance r  1/qcd. potential applications to the problem of connement on a light front
are discussed.

introduction

the description of qcd using light-cone methods has little in common with the more traditional
description using euclidean path integrals.
in particular, the latter approach admits wilsons
elegant criterion for connement, that the functional average of the gauge invariant wilson loop

trp exp ighc dxa fall o as et0a as the area, a, spanned by c gets large [1]. further, for

numerical work the path integral has a natural discretization by wilsons lattice gauge theory,
which has been very eectively exploited for ner and ner lattices [2]. an appealing feature of
lattice gauge theory is the manifest gauge invariancethere is no need for gauge xing. although the
lattice spacing breaks o(4) (euclidean lorentz) invariance, a discrete subgroup of o(4) remains,
so that violations of o(4) are irrelevant in the continuum limit.
in sharp contrast, light-cone quantization is only truly useful in a completely xed gauge a+ 
(a0 + a3)/2 = 0. moreover, the principle advantage of quantization on a light front is the
possibility of interpreting the resulting quantum system in the language of non-relativistic quantum
mechanics [35]: the manifest space-time symmetry is a galilei subgroup of the poincare group
generated by p   h, p k, m +k, m 12. a seventh generator p + plays the role of total newtonian
mass and is also conserved. the time in this newtonian analogue is t  (x0 + x3)/2, and if one
passes to an imaginary time formalism in which it   , one is led to a path integral formalism
which has no easily interpreted relation to that of the original euclidean gauge theory. for example,
it is not obvious how wilsons connement criterion can be implemented in this approach.

the problem is that the wilson line refers to curves in coordinate space, whereas the most
eective way to exploit light-front dynamics is to replace x by its conjugate p+. the closest one
can get to coordinate space is the mixed space x+, x, p+. recall that an r  t rectangular
wilson loop oriented in the time direction has the interpretation et e(r) as t   where e(r)
is the lowest energy of a quark and anti-quark pinned to points separated by a distance r. here
we propose instead that we consider a quark and anti-quark pinned to parallel lines separated by a
distance r. if there is connement, the lowest energy of this system should still be  t0r for large
r, with t0 the string tension. for light-cone dynamics, we can retain p + conservation by orienting
the parallel lines in the x3 direction.

as a rst semi-classical illustration of how this setup works, imagine a pair of particles con-

strained to move on two such parallel lines and interacting (in 3-space) via a potential v (|r |).

then in the center of mass system the hamiltonian will be

for very large r we can approximate

h = 2qm2 + p2

v (pz2 + r2)  v (r) +

z2
r

v (r) + 

(1.1)

(1.2)

which is a stable approximation only for an attractive force v  > 0. in that case the ground state
energy will be, to a good approximation,

2m + v (r) +

1

2r 2v (r)

mr  2m + v (r),

(1.3)

yielding the potential v (r), as desired.

in the remainder of this paper we will study this idea in the context of gauge theories. for
convenience we shall take the particles living on the lines (1-branes) to be dirac fermions. for

1

brevity, we shall call these constrained particles branions. the gauge elds will of course live in the
3 + 1 dimensional bulk space-time. in section 2, we address the problem of calculating the energy
of a pair of 1-branes separated by a distance r. in the weak coupling limit some sort of ladder
approximation is appropriate. we study three versions of this approximation: the bethe-salpeter
equation in feynman gauge and light-cone gauge, and a tamm-danco approximation [6] to the
problem of minimizing the energy of such a system. for larger coupling, the ladder approximation
fails, and the only simplication available is to the planar diagrams of large nc qcd [7].
in
section 3, we study the s-matrix for a branion on one line scattering o an anti-branion on the
other through one-loop in light-cone gauge. for simplicity we assume the (anti-) branions couple
to large nc qcd in the bulk and are in the ( nc)nc representation of su (nc). we show in detail
how asymptotic freedom emerges and exhibit all of the light-cone p + = 0 divergences which
are shown to disappear if virtual momenta are taken on-shell in a particular way. we conclude in
section 4 with some comments on how our proposal can be put to use in studying quark connement
using light-front methods.

2 calculating the energy

our purpose in studying separated 1-branes is to devise a light-front friendly method to extract
the force between charged sources separated by a variable distance r. the proposal is to minimize
the system energy u (r) with the constraint that each 1-brane carries a non-zero charge or color,
and to identify u (r) with the force, at least in certain regimes.
because the sources are constrained to lines, rather than to points, this minimization involves
the 1+1 dimensional quantum dynamics of the sources, and this puts certain limitations on possible
applications.

 first of all it gives no useful information about sources that repel one another. in this case
the minimum energy conguration is that with the sources at opposite ends of their respective
1-branes yielding a minimum energy independent of r. this is no problem for settling the
issue of connement, since that requires the energy due to separated sources in an overall color
singlet state. such sources will attract one another whether or not connement is realized in
the theory.

 even if the sources attract one another, the physical meaning of the minimal energy as a
function of r can be clouded by the brane dynamics. for example, if the branions are
massless and the actual interaction energy falls o only as 1/r (i.e. connement does not
occur), the charge on each brane can spread to a size of order r as r   so, although the
minimal energy might fall o as 1/r, the coecient is reduced compared to that of the actual
potential. in that case the method would establish the absence of connement but would not
yield a direct measure of the interaction potential. giving the branions a mass would provide
a limitation to the growth of the charge size, so that the asymptotic behavior of the minimal
energy would exactly track that of the actual potential.

 in the context of qcd, we expect connement to show up as a linear growth  t0r in the
minimal energy at large r. however the brane dynamics would not automatically ensure
(via asymptotic freedom) a valid weak coupling description of the opposite limit r  0.
that would require that all relevant momentum scales be large compared to qcd: not
only 1/r but also the momentum transfers involved in the binding dynamics. to track
the force from a perturbative description at small r to connement at large r we require

2

that the branions be very heavy: 1/ab = ncg2m  qcd. here ab is the bohr radius for
the coulombic bound state, and sets the size of charge distribution on each brane. if the
inequality holds, the minimal energy will have a renormalization group improved coulombic
behavior ncg2(r)/4r for ab  r  1/qcd and, if connement occurs, a linear growth
for r  1/qcd. the behavior of the minimal energy for r . ab is reective of the two
branion composite system, and has no direct interpretation as an eective force between two
point sources.

weak coupling methods (valid in qcd for short distance phenomena) can only eectively de-
scribe bound states close to threshold, that is when the bound state mass m (r)  2m in the
zero coupling limit. this is a nonrelativistic regime: in the center of mass system energy transfers
and the squares of momentum transfers are of order o(2m  m ). because energy transfers are
much smaller than momentum transfers, the propagators of exchanged gluons describe eectively
instantaneous interactions, and the nonrelativistic schrodinger equation is applicable. this non-
relativistic dynamics can be identied in quantum eld theory in a number of ways which we shall
address below. for large distances, where ncs(r)  1, a full-edged nonperturbative treatment
is required. we advocate an approach based on summing the planar graphs of t hoofts large nc
limit. this limit leads to important simplications, both because it suppresses pair production and
because only planar graphs need be summed. unfortunately, in the continuum theory no further
simplication is possible. but we think it particularly interesting to consider a strong t hooft
coupling limit in the context of light-cone quantization with discretization of both p + and x+.
of course, this limit takes one far from the continuum theory, but it is likely to be described by
string theory [8]. this possibility has been strengthened recently by developments surrounding the
maldacena conjecture [911].

in the remainder of this section we discuss the energy of two 1-brane sources in the weak
coupling limit of threshold binding. we consider the conguration of a branion anti-branion pair
each conned to 1 + 1-dimensional branes separated by a transverse distance r. the gauge elds,
which take values in the lie algebra of u (nc), live in the 4-dimensional bulk space-time. our model
is therefore described by the lagrangian,

l = 

1
4

trf f  + (x)1 [i(  iga)  m] 1
+(x  r)2 [i(  iga)  m] 2 ,

(2.1)

where the index  only runs over brane coordinates. the eld strengths are given by f =
a   a  ig[a, a]. note that with this normalization s = g2/2.
it is useful to identify a subset of graphs which is responsible for binding in this regime as a
starting point for understanding what happens as the coupling is increased. as r increases from
small values, we can begin to see gradually how more complicated diagrams become important.
optimistically this inside-out approach may provide a framework for understanding the dynamics
of connement in the large nc limit. of course we expect weak coupling binding to be captured
by the sum of ladder diagrams or by the associated bethe-salpeter equation. we rst discuss
that approach. ladder diagrams are gauge dependent, but that dependence should disappear in
the non-relativistic binding regime. we shall conrm this expectation by examining the ladder
approximation in both feynman and light-cone gauges. later we shall show how tamm-danco
truncation can capture the same physics.

2.1 summing ladder feynman diagrams

we write the integral equation describing the ladder sum for the channel where a branion (with
2-momentum p) moves on a 1-brane oriented parallel to the z-axis passing through x = 0 and
an anti-branion (of 2-momentum q) moves on a parallel 1-brane passing through x = r. call
the green function, describing the coupling of the branion and anti-branion to a bound system of

the reduction is a bit more ecient in light-cone gauge, wherein the only relevant component
of the gluon propagator is d = 2ik/k+(k2  2k+k).
in the nonrelativistic regime the
particles on the branes have energies of order m + o(ncs/r) but momenta of order o(ncsm)
so that the momentum transfer k = k+ + o(ncs/r) = o(ncsm). thus we can make the
replacement d  +2i/(k2 + 2k+2) in the bethe-salpeter equation, which with the following

2.2 light front tamm-danco approach

in 2-dimensions the branion dirac spinors have two components (see eq. (2.1)), however, in light-
cone quantization with a = 0, they are not independent. thus, in the operator hamiltonian
approach one must eliminate one of the components and express the dynamics in terms of single
component spinors. this leads us to the light-cone hamiltonian,

proportional to (0) are associated with branion dynamics on a single brane. the divergent coe-
cients are due to the zero thickness of the brane, not the uv singularities of the bulk eld theory.
to deal with them at higher order, they should be regulated by giving a small thickness to the
branes. in this paper we shall only see the eect of these terms in the one-loop branion self energy,
where it can be absorbed into mass and wave function renormalization. more generally when the
four branion vertex from these terms is combined with the corresponding exchange graphs, the
most severe quadratic divergence cancels leaving a net logarithmic divergence. however, for our
problem of the force between separated branes we do not need to consider these terms to the order
in which we are working.

in eq. (2.25) we have absorbed the divergent (0) factors into the renormalized branion mass, mr.
this equation is still ill-dened both because of the k0(m0) terms and because the p+ integrations
are divergent at p+ = p+, q+. these divergences can be associated with the truncation of terms
with two or more gluons in the eigenvalue equation [6, 12, 13].

one approach to this problem is the ad hoc replacement 2e  m2

r/q+ in the expression
for m 2, which causes the non-integrable singularities to disappear. the only justication is that
this replacement is formally valid to order g2nc, and so might arguably be provided if higher
terms are properly included [6, 12, 13]. making the replacement gives m 2(p+, q+)  m 2(p+) =
r|p+  p+|2/p+p+. with this simplication the factors proportional to k0(m  0) have the right

momentum dependence to be absorbed into a further renormalization of the branion mass, mr.

3 scattering to one loop

in this section we show asymptotic freedom for the conguration of a branion anti-branion pair
conned to 1-branes separated by a distance r. we shall show this by calculating the four-point
scattering amplitude. for simplicity we shall only calculate the planar diagrams of t hoofts large
nc limit [7].

we shall work in light-cone gauge (a = 0), and use the following conventions:

 = (0  3)/2

,

{, } = 2 .

(3.1)

also the space-time metric is given by  = diag[1, 1, 1, 1]. we shall also adopt the following
notation; lower case momenta are 2-vectors on the brane while upper case momenta are bulk 4-
vectors. so for a 4-vector q we distinguish its components longitudinal to the brane via qk (a
2-vector with light-cone components q+, q) from its transverse components q (in bold-face - a
euclidean 2-vector).

when we compute the individual feynman diagrams for the one-loop four-point s-matrix it

will be convenient to express them in terms of a fourier integral

(p, q, qk, r) =z

dq
(2)2 eiqr (p, q, qk, q),

(3.2)

where we shall be calculating (p, q, qk, q), which has the explicit q dependence.

with these conventions the light-cone feynman rules (using the double line notation) are
presented in fig.2. in the following we shall regulate the integration by an ultraviolet cuto on the
transverse momenta, k2 < 2, and an infrared cuto on k +, k + > .

the subscripts on the s distinguish between the dierent branes. all branion-branion-gluon
vertices only include the + component of , since the gluon propagator, d, vanishes when
 = +.

(3.10)

the procedure to evaluate eq. (3.9) is relatively straightforward. we rst perform the k 
integration via contour integration (inserting the appropriate factors of i). we are only interested
in obtaining all the log (and log2) divergent terms. these arise as dependence on the ultraviolet
cuto, , and on the infrared cuto, . by investigating these divergences separately and combining,
we obtain all the divergent pieces.

for convenience we introduce the following compact notation

w =

w2 + m2

w+

,

(3.11)

where w is a brane 2-vector such that w2 = 2w+w. thus the result for the triangle graph on

target the divergences associated with the transverse integration, dk and those associated with
the k + integration. combining these contributions yields all the divergent pieces of this integral.
then again using the notation adopted in eq. (3.11) we get

it is noteworthy that after multiplying by eiqr and integrating over q as prescribed in eq. (3.2),
the ultraviolet divergences ln 2 and the ln2  divergences disappear because they are multiplied by
(r) = 0 at nite separation. thus the box is not needed to obtain asymptotic freedom in this
branion scattering process. the ln  divergences, however, remain and are necessary to eventually
obtain  independent on-shell scattering.

3.5 divergence structure of the one loop 4 point function

we have assembled the various pieces necessary to construct the divergent structure of the o-shell
one-loop four-point green function. the one-loop four-point amplitude is given by: four-point trees
with a factor of z2, see eq. (3.7), for each external leg; a four-point exchange diagram with the
one-loop gluon propagator, eq. (3.8); the triangle graphs of fig. 5 (the solution for the graph on the
right can be obtained by a simple substitution in the solution for the graph on the left, eq. (3.12));
the box graph, eq. (3.14). since we have taken nc  , we have of course not included non-planar
contributions, e.g. from the crossed box graph.
when we simplify the four-point function all terms proportional to ln 2/q2 cancel up to
the expected 11
3 ln 2/q2 term which is the correct asymptotic behavior for qcd. also all terms
proportional to ln2 q+/ cancel. note that these cancelations occur before integrating over q, but
do involve all of the one loop diagrams. as mentioned in subsection 3.4 the box diagram shows no
ln  or ln2  dependence after integrating over q as prescribed in eq. (3.2).

ln

since this o-shell amplitude is not, as it stands, a physical quantity, it is not necessary that
the ln  divergences cancel. even the on-shell limit is not quite physical because of the usual ir
divergences associated with the possibility of soft gluon bremsstrahlung. in particular the terms we
have labeled finite are cuto independent and nite o-shell, but display ir divergences in the
on-shell limit. focusing on the ln  terms, we see that the on-shell limit involves ambiguous terms
of the form 0/0. dropping the terms that unambiguously vanish on-shell, these terms simplify to:

(3.16)

since w = m2/w+  2w we see that by taking the branions in either the initial or nal states
equally o energy shell these ambiguous terms can be eliminated. note that this restriction still
allows the total energy to be o-shell, an important exibility for bound state problems. while
we are free to make this restriction on the initial and nal states, it would not be allowed if this
o-shell amplitude were part of a larger diagram. in that case, there must be other ln  terms for
them to cancel against. we have not yet managed to show that this actually happens. even so we
have achieved our goal in this section of demonstrating asymptotic freedom, which did involve an
intricate cancelation of ln  divergences in the coecient of ln 2.

4 discussion and conclusion

in this paper we have proposed a light-front friendly way to extract the interaction energy between
two sources in a gauge theory. we have analyzed the method in several ways at weak coupling. but
the larger motivation for this proposal is to develop a framework within a light-cone quantization
approach for establishing quark connement in non-abelian gauge theories.

consider, for example, the t hooft limit of nc  , which is well known to reduce to summing
planar graphs. another version of this limit interprets the sum of planar diagrams on a light front
as the quantum dynamics of a gluonic chain [15]. without the notion of pinned sources, these chains
would be dynamical bound states, and the concept of a conning force would have to be indirectly
inferred from the excitation spectrum of these chains. in ordinary equal time quantization, the
concept of a wilson loop allows a direct denition of the conning force, however the possibility of
vacuum uctuations clouds the chain interpretation of the large nc limit. our goal was to modify
the wilson criterion to make it suitable for light front physics.

in light-cone quantization the sum of planar diagrams coupled to two separated 1-branes can
be interpreted as the dynamics of a nonrelativistic chain of gluons vibrating in the transverse space
and stretched between the points in transverse space marking the locations of the 1-branes. since

14

the p+ of each gluon and branion is dynamical, the newtonian mass of each of these objects varies;
but in such a way that the total mass is conserved [5]. this picture is made more concrete when
the p+ is discretized, p+  m m, where m is a large integer, and m is the discrete unit of p+. we
hope that pinning the ends of the chain to points will oer conceptual and technical simplications
to the problem of assessing whether the dynamics of the chain leads to a conning force.

although the dynamics of continuum gauge theories generically involves a scale dependent cou-
pling which is presumably never actually much larger than unity, the introduction of an ultraviolet
cuto allows a formal strong coupling limit. for example, the discretization of x+ (in addition
to p+) provides such a cuto [8]. in that context the strong t hooft coupling limit favors large
planar shnet diagrams, which should behave as seamless world sheets. in this limit then the sum
of planar diagrams coupled to our 1-branes would correspond to a fundamental light-cone string
stretched between them, and therefore a conning force would emerge. however, the precise nature
of such a shnet approximation to qcd is yet to be determined.
