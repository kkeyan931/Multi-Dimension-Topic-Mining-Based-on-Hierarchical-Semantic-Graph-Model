we give an explicit formulation of the threedimensional sl(4, r)/so(2, 2) model repre-
senting the vedimensional einstein gravity coupled to the dilaton and the threeform eld for
spacetimes with two commuting killing vector elds. new matrix representation is obtained which
is similar to one found earlier in the fourdimensional einsteinmaxwelldilatonaxion (emda)
theory. the sl(4, r) symmetry joins a variety of 5d solutions of dierent physical types including
strings, 0branes, kk monopoles etc.
interpreting them as duals to the fourdimensional kerr
metric translated along the fth coordinate. the symmetry transformations are used to construct
new rotating strings and composite (0  1)branes endowed with a nut parameter.

model, however, can not be generalized to include rotat-
ing or dyon solutions, contrary to the situation in the
stationary fourdimensional em or einsteinmaxwell
dilatonaxion (emda) systems. certain rotating p
brane solutions were presented by cvetic and youm [5]
apparently hinted by the myers and perry [6] multidi-
mensional kerrlike metrics, but, to our knowledge, no
constructive derivation of such solutions has been given
so far.

as a step further in developing generating techniques
for larger classes of pbranes, we suggest here a new
matrix representation for the maharanaschwarz sym-
metry [7] of the vedimensional gravity coupled to
three-form and dilaton with two commuting killing vec-
tor elds. the novel feature consists in exploiting an
exceptional local isomorphism between the maharana
schwarz group so(3, 3) relevant to the case and the
group sl(4, r). this opens a way to construct instead
of the 6 6 matrix realization a simpler representation of
the symmetry by 4 4 real matrices, which, in turn, may
be regarded as a direct generalization of the sp(4, r)
formulation of the stationary fourdimensional emda
theory [8]. this framework naturally incorporates rotat-
ing strings as well as dyontype solutions which may be
interpreted as composite states of strings and 0-branes.

i. introduction

recent interest to soliton solutions in multidimensional
supergravities stimulates a search of solution generat-
ing techniques relevant to various gravity coupled sys-
tems containing antisymmetric forms. dimensional re-
duction of these theories reveals global symmetries which
can be eectively used for such purposes. but although
general structure of global symmetries in dimensionally
reduced supergravities is wellknown [1,2], their prac-
tical application requires additional eorts to be done.
one has to construct suitable matrix representations in
terms of which these symmetries, acting nonlinearly
(and perhaps partly nonlocally) on the set of initial
eld variables, could be expressed in a tractable way. in
dimension three or in higher dimensions with suitably
truncated metric ansatz one is able to express all vari-
ables in terms of scalar elds forming some nonlinear
model, in which case the symmetry transformations
are particularly simple. it has been shown recently [3]
that all blockdiagonal pbrane solutions including black,
multiplecenter, intersecting ones as well as uxbranes
and their nonlinear superpositions with charged branes
can be produced within a simple model, the essential
part of which has the same structure as the static four
dimensional einsteinmaxwell (em) system [4]. this

our model constitutes another example of 4 4 ma-
trix theories of which it has the maximal dimension of the
target space. the threedimensional reduction of the 4d
emda theory with one vector eld corresponds to the
sp(4, r)/so(1, 2) coset which is six-dimensional. the
same theory with two vector elds may be formulated
as su (2, 2)/u (1, 1) model with the eightdimensional
target space [9]. it is likely that the present case closes
the list of theories whose reduction to three dimensions
gives a 4  4 representation, now for ninedimensional
target space. there is some similarity with the case of
emda with two vector elds, in fact the present theory
in four dimensions also has two vector elds, but it is
endowed with an additional scalar modulus. therefore
the target space now is odddimensional and is no more
kahler. still the matrix structure is very similar to that
found previously in the sp(4, r) theory, which can be ob-
tained from the present one by identifying two dierent
2  2 blocks. (although the target space is not kahler,
suitable ernstlike complex potentials can also be found,
in terms of which the target space metrics exhibits a close
similarity to that of the emda theory.) the standard
representation of sl(4, r) in terms of the 1  3 block
decomposition was applied to vedimensional dilaton
axion gravity in [10]. this formulation, however, does not
make contact with neither sp(4, r) nor su (2, 2) theories
and thus is less useful for solution generation.

our starting point is the vedimensional action

(1)

where  is the dilaton, h = d b is an antisymmet-
ric threeform. we perform a twostep reduction to
the threedimensional theory making rst the kaluza
klein ansatz for the vedimensional metric suppressing
a spacelike coordinate

with all elds depending only on x. then

(3)

where a = adx, f = da. the vedimensional two
form b can be decomposed into the fourdimensional
twoform b and the fourdimensional oneform a

b = b  dy  a.

(4)

then the fourdimensional h will include the appropri-
ate chernsimons terms

h = db  a  f,

where f = da.

omitting a total divergence one obtains the following

the value of the dilaton coupling constant here is as-
sumed to correspond to dimensional reduction of the
elevendimensional supergravity: 2 = 8/3. dualising

thus in four dimensions the theory is equivalent to ein-
stein gravity coupled to two scalars, one pseudoscalar and
two vector elds. the equations of motion corresponding
to this action consist of a coupled set of maxwell equa-
tions

where ad  bc = 1. therefore, the duality group in four

iii. reduction to three dimensions

as a second step we reduce the theory to three dimen-

sions assuming stationarity of the four-metric:

ds2

4 = f (dt  idxi)2 + f 1hijdxidxj ,

(28)

where f, i and hij depend only on xi. in three dimen-
sions vector elds can be parameterized by scalar poten-
tials va, ua, a = 1, 2 via

where the p1, p2 and q are the real 2  2 matrices
and p1, p2 are symmetric matrices with the same de-
terminant. this matrix is a direct generalization of the
sp(4, r) matrix found in [8] in the case of the four
dimensional emda theory. its inverse is given by

where es1+s4  s2s3 = et1+t4  t2t3. one can identify the
following oneparametric transformations

and another generating the threeform electric compo-
nent

the following identity is useful in establishing the equiv-
alence between (35) and (36):

1 + dp2dp 1

tr (cid:0)dmdm1(cid:1)
 tr (cid:0)dp1dp 1

using it one can nd the following parameterization of
the desired 2  2 matrices in terms of the potentials:

p1 = e/2(cid:18) f e  (v1)2e v1e

where

 = v1 (u1  v2) + v2 (u2  v1) .

(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)

therefore, the threedimensional action can be rewritten
as

s3 =z d3xh(cid:26)r3 +

tr (cid:0)mm1(cid:1)(cid:27) .

(44)

this action is invariant under the 15parametric
sl(4, r) transformations m  gtmg with constant
g  sl(4, r). for g it is convenient to use the gauss
decomposition into the product of left (triangle), center
(blockdiagonal) and right (triangle) matrices as follow

g = lsr,

l 1(cid:19) , s =(cid:18) s1 0

l =(cid:18) 1 0
where l, r are arbitrary real 2  2 matrices, s, t are
arbitrary real 2  2 matrices satisfying det s = det t .

0 1 (cid:19) ,
t (cid:19) , r =(cid:18) 1 r

it is easy to check that r-transformations

are pure gauge. s-transformations

contain two gauge, three dierent scale and two (elec-
tric type) harrison transformations. this subgroup is
seven-parametric and the corresponding parameter ma-
trices read

the subgroup of the left transformations l is more dif-
cult to write in terms of its action on the potentials. in
terms of 2  2 matrices it reads:

(57)

using the parameterization l =(cid:18) l1 l2

l3 l4 (cid:19), one can iden-

tify l1 as a parameter of the ehlers transformation, l2, l3
as parameters of the magnetic harrison transformations,
and l4 as a parameter of the ehlerslike part of sduality.
the rst three transformations are rather complicated, so
we give here explicitly only the last one:

iv. solution generation

our interpretation of the sl(4, r) transformations
is based on the four-dimensional picture, therefore two
type harrison transformations correspond to dierent
ve-dimensional charges:
one pair is related to the
non-diagonal components of the ve-dimensional metric,
while another pair  to the three-form eld. thus, tak-
ing as seeds the four-dimensional vacuum solutions, one
can generate in the rst case the vacuum 5d metrics,
and in the second  the three-form supported congu-
rations. starting with the ytranslated four-dimensional
schwarzschild solution

(63)

and applying the sequences of transformations including
the second type electric harrison transformation one ar-
rives at the electric string solution [11]. more precisely,
the threeform electric component is produced by the
electric harrison transformations (56) with the parame-
ter t2 = , then one has to compensate the asymptotic
values of variables to make the solution asymptotically
at. one possibility is to use the following chain of trans-
formations: the electric gauge (54), t3 = /(1  2); the
scale transformation (50), t1 = s1 = 1
4 ln(1  2); the
dilaton shift (51), t4 = s4 =  1
4 ln(1  2) and the mod-
ulus shift (52), t = 1

2 ln(1  2). the nal result is

(62)

two other useful subspaces of the full target space
(35) correspond to the vedimensional vacuum (v2 =
u2 =  = 0,  = 2, the symmetry group being
sl(3, r)) and to the four-dimensional emda system
(v2 = v1, u2 = u1,  = 0, with the symmetry sp(4, r)).
the corresponding solutions can be used as seeds as well.

this is the black string, of which the extremal version is
achieved in the limit   1, m  0, q nite.
one can apply a similar chain of transformations in-
cluding the second type magnetic harrison transforma-
tion (57) with l3 = . the necessary adjustment includes
the magnetic gauge (47) (r2 = /(1  2)), the scale
transformation (50) (t1 = s1 = 1
4 ln(1  2)), the dilaton
shift (51) (t4 = s4 = 1
4 ln(1  2)) and the modulus shift
(52) (t =  1

(67)

to interpret it physically, one has to note that in ve di-
mensions the three-form is dual to the two-form eld h,
which will have non-zero the components htr like in the
case of the four-dimensional magnetically charged black
hole. thus we deal with the black 5d magnetic 0-brane,
of which the extremal version corresponds to m = 0.

application of the rst type harrison transformations
generate vacuum 5d solutions. note, that a variety of
such solutions were found in the past using dierent tech-
niques [1219]. all of them, as well as their generaliza-
tions including a nut parameter, can be found via suit-
able chains of the sl(3, r) transformations (forming a
subgroup of the sl(4, r) with v2 = u2 =  = 0,  =
2) from the four-dimensional kerr metric. for more
detailed analysis of the vacuum 5d metrics with two com-
muting isometries through the the sl(3, r) symmetry
see [15].

one is got by an electric harrison transformation (55)
with a parameter s3 =  together with an appropriate
compensation of asymptotic values:

charges associated with f and f , and one rotation pa-
rameter. note that, since we are considering the class of
5d metrics with non-compact killing orbits, only one ro-
tation parameter is allowed. therefore, the general string
solution should contain seven free parameters. here
we exhibit only the simplest four-parametric subfamilies
which can be presented in a concise form.

one can repeat the same calculations as before using as
a seed the y-translated fourdimensional vacuum kerr
nut metric

combining together electric and magnetic harrison
transformations one can obtain solutions with larger
number of free parameters. from these we give explic-
itly a relatively simple composite string  magnetic zero-
brane solution. it can be derived applying a sequence of
the second type electric and magnetic harrison transfor-
mations to the seed schwarzschild metric. the resulting
solution is

when p = 0 the solution reduces to the electric string
(64), while for q = 0 one recovers the magnetic zero-
brane (64). note that, when both charges are non-zero,
one has also a nut parameter, so the solution is not
strictly asymptotically at. one can compensate the
nut charge via the ehlers transformation thus making
it an additional free parameter. we intend to discuss this
and more general solutions in a separate publication.

vi. concluding remarks

we have shown that large classes of solutions to 5d
dilaton-axion gravity admitting two commuting isome-
tries with non-compact orbits can be obtained in a unique
way using the sl(4, r) duality from the vacuum four-
dimensional metrics such as schwarzschild or kerr-nut.
this class does not include spherically symmetric or ro-
tating ve-dimensional black holes which, although pos-
sess two commuting killing symmetries too, have one of
them of the rotational type. these solutions are still
within the scope of the present -model, but the group
transformations generically relate them to asymptotically
non-at metrics (e.g. corresponding to black holes in the
eld of a uxbrane [3]) and we did not consider them
here. the sl(4, r) duality also connects solutions of
the 5d dilaton-axion gravity with solutions of the four-
dimensional emda system, which constitute a subspace
(v1 = v2, u1 = u2,  = 0) of the full target space and may
be used as seeds to generate ve-dimensional solutions.
an essentially new solution we presented here is the
composite (0  1)-brane which is a superposition of an
electric string and a 0-brane supported by the magnetic
sector of the three-form eld. this is an example of a
dyonic composite solution in the case when electric and
magnetic branes have dierent world-volume dimensions.
the situation is similar to that in the eleven-dimensional
supergravity where one has electric two-branes and mag-
netic ve-branes. in the latter case composite electric-
magnetic solutions are realized either as intersecting two-
and ve-branes, or as composite 2  5 branes [21]. note
that the ve-dimensional lagrangian does not contain the
chern-simons term which is essential for existence of the
2  5 brane in the eleven-dimensional supergravity.
