abstract

primary elds and correlators of an arbitrary abelian coset confor-
mal eld theory are explicitly expressed in terms of the two related
conformal eld theories. in particular we present a new realization of
the zk invariant parafermionic conformal eld theory.the coset theory
has global abelian symmetry.

in this paper we study conformal eld theories based on the generalized

coset construction [1-3]

k(m) = l(m)  lu(m), m  z,

(1)

where l(m) , lu(m) are virasoro generators and lu(m) are quadratic in
ane u(1)d currents which have unit conformal dimensions with respect to
l(m) and lu(m).

when l(m) are given by sugawara construction for the ane lie algebra
g we have g/u(1)d coset constructions. the su(2)/u(1) coset conformal eld
theory is equivalent to the zk invariant parafermionic theory whose studies
were initiated by fateev and zamolodchikov [5]. for arbitrary simple lie
algebras g the g/u(1)d models were studied in refs. [6-9].

there are many other w algebras which have u(1)d ane subalgebra
and can be reduced to coset (1).the class of such algebras includes n = 2
superconformal algebras [10], n-extended superconformal algebras [11, 12]
, non-semi-simply ane-sugawara constructions [13, 14] which are used in
superstring theories and other. classical w algebras with virasoro genera-
tors (1) were studied in ref.[15].however primary elds and correlators of the
quantum eld theory based on (1) were not found.

the object of this paper is to construct primary elds of (1) and the
corresponding correlators in terms of the original theory based on l(m) and
u(1)d currents.to nd the primary elds we use their transformation proper-
ties under the coset conformal algebra. solving the corresponding dierential
equations we express the primary elds of (1) in terms of the original pri-
mary elds and u(1)d currents. this enables us to express the corresponding
correlators in terms of the original ones.all the eld of the theory commute
with the heisenberg algebra generated by non-zero modes of u(1)d and form
non-trivial representations of u(1)d.

we begin with the commutator relations for the virasoro and u(1)d sub-

algebras of the original w algebra

[l(m), l(n)] = (m  n)l(m + n) + c(cid:20) 1

12

(m3  m)(cid:21) m,n,

(2)

[j i(m), j j(n)] = kmijm,n,

[l(m), j i(n)] = nj i(m + n),

where m, n  z and 1  i, j  d. the central charges c and k of the algebras
are real. the vacuum state |0 > satises

< 0|j i(m < 0) = j i(m  0)|0 >= 0.

we shall also use the ane-virasoro primary elds g(w) which satisfy

the equations

[l(m), g(w)] = wm+1wg(w) + (m + 1)wmg(w),

[j i(m), g(w)] = iwmg(w),

2

where  is the conformal dimension of g(w) and  = (i) is the weight.
the n-point correlator of the primary elds is dened by

g(, z) =< 0|g1(z1), g2(z2), . . . , gn(zn)|0 > .

the virasoro operators lu(m) are given by

lu(m) =

1
2k

d

xi=1

: j i(m  n)j i(n) :.

the normal-ordering symbol : : means that negative modes of the currents
are on the left. the operators lu(m) satisfy virasoro algebra (2) with the
central charge c = d and

[lu(m), j i(n)] = nj i(m + n).

one can compute

[lu(m), g(w)] =

1
k

wm+1 :   j(w)g(w) : +

2
2k

(m + 1)wmg(w),

(3)

where

: j(w)g(w) := xm<0

j i(m)wm1g(w) + g(w) xm0

j i(m)wm1.

the coset generators k(m) (1) satisfy virasoro algebra (2) with the cen-

tral charge c  d and

[j i(m), k(n)] = 0.

(4)

this equation suggests that all the elds of the coset model commute with
j i(m). however, as we shall see, primary elds of the coset model com-
mute only with the heisenberg algebra generated by j i(m), m 6= 0. this
fact was used for construction vertex operators corresponding to the g/u(1)d
[8]. we assume that the coset primary elds g(w)
parafermions in ref.
satisfy the equations

[k(m), g(w)] = wm+1w g(w) + (m + 1)wm g(w),

[j i(m), g(w)] = i g(w)m,o,

(5)

(6)

where  is a scalar.

here we give a solution of these equations

g(w) = u 

<(w)g(w)u (w),

 =

2k

,

(7)

where

u 

<(w) = e

k q<(w),

u (w) = u 

0 (w)u 

>(w),

u 

>(w) = e

k q>(w),

<(w) =  xm<0

0 (w) = w

qi

>(w) =  xm>0

j i(m)wm,

j i(m)wm.

to check (5) we have the following computations

[k(m), g(w)] = u 

<(w) [k(m), g(w)] u (w)

= wm+1u 

<(w)(cid:16)wg(w)  1

+ (m + 1)wm g(w)

k :   j(w)g(w) :(cid:17) u 

= wm+1w g(w) + (m + 1)wm g(w).

here we used eqs. (4),(3) and at the last step the relations

wu 

<(w) =

wu (w) =

1
k
1
k

u 

<(w) xm<0
u (w) xm0

  j(m)wm1
  j(m)wm1.

it is easy to check that (7) also satises eq. (6).

the initial primary elds can be expressed as follows

g(w) = (u 

<(w))1 g(w) (u (w))1 .

computations show that

u 
0 (z)g(w) = g(w)u 

0 (z)z



k ,

g(z)u 

<(w) = u 

<(z)g(w)(cid:18)1

from this it follows that the n point coset correlator can be written as

< 0| g1(z1) g2(z2)    gn(zn)|0 >= g(, z)yi<j

ij
k .

(zi  zj)

in the case of su(2)/u(1) this relation was obtained in ref. [5].

using eq. (8) one can nd the ope of two coset primary elds
g(z) g(w) = (z  w)
let us consider the su(2)/u(1) coset.the su(2) algebra is generated by

<(w)g(z)g(w)u (z)u (w).

<(z)u

(9)



the currents e+(z), e (z) and j(z) which satisfy the opes

e+(z)e+(w) = reg,
k

e+(z)e (w) =

j(z)j(w) =

e (z)e (w) = reg,

+ reg,

2j(w)

(z  w)2 +
(z  w)2 + reg.

k

the su(2)/u(1) virasoro generator k(z) is given by

k(z) = xm

k(m)zm2 = lsu(2)(z)  lu(1)(z),

(10)

(11)

where

lsu(2)(z) =

lu(1)(z) =

: j(z)j(z) : .

2(k + 2) (cid:16): j(z)j(z) : + : e+(z)e (z) : + : e (z)e+(z) :(cid:17) ,

the current j(z) = pm j(m)zm1 has unit conformal dimension with re-
spect to lsu(2)(z) = pm lsu(2)(m)zm2 and lu(1)(z) = pm lu(1)(m)zm2

[lsu(2)(m), j(n)] = [lu(1)(m), j(n)] = nj i(m + n)

according to eq. (7) the coset currents are given by

e+(z) = e
e (z) = e 

2
k q<(z)e+(z)e
2
k q<(z)e (z)e 

2
k q>(z)z

2
k j(0),
2
k j(0).

2
k q>(z)z

these elds are closely related with z operators for su(2) [16, 17].

using eqs. (9-11) one can check that the currents

1(z) = (1/k) e+(z),

1 (z) = (1/k) e (z)
+

(12)

satisfy the parafermionic algebra of ref. [5]

1(z)+

1 (w) = (z  w)2+ 2

k  i +

k + 2

k

k(w)(z  w)2 + o(cid:16)(z  w)3(cid:17)! ,

where k(w) is given by (11).it seems that equations (12) give a new realiza-
tion of the parafermionic currents 1(z) and +

1 (z).
