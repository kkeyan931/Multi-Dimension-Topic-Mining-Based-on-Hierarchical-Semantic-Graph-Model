abstract

we study a membrane  anti-membrane system in matrix theory. it in fact ex-

hibits the tachyon instability. by suitably representing this conguration, we

obtain a (2+1)-dimensional u(2) gauge theory with a t hoofts twisted bound-

ary condition. we identify the tachyon eld with a certain o-diagonal element

of the gauge elds in this model. taking into account the boundary conditions

carefully, we can nd vortex solutions which saturate the bogomolnyi-type

bound and manifest the tachyon condensation. we show that they can be

interpreted as gravitons in matrix theory.

1 introduction

it is well-known that a tachyon develops when a d-brane and an anti-d-brane come up to

some critical interval of order of string scale [1, 2, 3]. hence the system of a brane and an

anti-brane is unstable, and the tachyon elds roll down to a stable point [5]. recently sen

argued that the d-brane  anti-d-brane pair is annihilated via the tachyon condensation

and in this process certain stable d-branes are produced as soliton solutions on this system

[4, 6, 7, 8]. these stable d-branes are basically classied into two classes. one is stable

non-bps d-branes with codimension one [4, 6, 7, 8, 9]. they are stabilized by certain

orbifold or orientifold projections, and can be identied with kink solutions. the other

is bps d-branes with codimension two, and they can be interpreted as vortex solutions,

or kink solutions on unstable d-branes with codimension one, on the brane  anti-brane

pair [6, 8]. both classes of stable d-branes has been understood in terms of the k-theory

in more general way [11], and the author in [12] suggested possible applications of this

line of arguments to matrix theory.

in this paper we study the latter mechanism in matrix theory [13]. we consider
a specic example, a system of membrane  anti-membrane pair,4 in which gravitons
are supposed to be produced as vortex solutions on the membrane worldvolume via the

tachyon condensation:

m2 + m2 hti6=0

graviton (vortex),

where hti denotes the vacuum expectation value of the tachyon elds.
this corresponds to the mechanism in type iia theory [6],

d2 + d2 hti6=0

d0 (vortex) or d0 (anti-vortex).

(1)

(2)

in matrix theory we should not expect the appearance of anti-gravitons (corresponding

to d0 in type iia theory), for the matrix description of m-theory is thought of as an

innite momentum limit or as a light-like limit of m-theory. in fact we will see below that

we cannot have an anti-vortex solution in the matrix calculation.

2 the setup

in string theory the tachyon potential can in principle be computed, but it is hardly

possible to carry it out in all order. in matrix theory, however, we in fact have a simple

tachyon potential of quartic order, due to having taken a special limit of m-theory [14].

4hereafter we will denote membranes and anti-membranes as m 2 and m 2 respectively. we will also

use the abbreviation dp and dp respectively for dp-branes and anti-dp-branes.

1

now let us see how tachyon modes appear in the background of the m2-m2 pair in matrix

theory, which was studied in detail in [15, 16]. the matrix theory action is

s =

1

r3m 6

p z dttr(cid:26)1

2

(dtx i)2 +

1
4

[x i, x j]2 + t dt + it i[xi, ](cid:27) ,

(3)

where x i (i = 1,   , 9) and  are nn hermitian matrices. r is the radius of a light-like
circle and mp is the eleven dimensional planck mass. we use a convention t  i[a0,] for
the covariant derivative dt.
we can express the m2-m2 pair spreading over the (8,9)-directions of interval b in the

7-direction by the background matrices

b8 =   p1

0 p2 ! , b9 =   q1

0

0

0 b ! ,
0 q2 ! , b7 =   0 0

(4)

where pi and qi satisfy the commutation relation [pi, qi] = ic with a constant c which is
a charge density of the membrane [17]. the upper diagonal block corresponds to m2 and

the lower to m2. the background matrices for the other directions, the gauge potential

a0 and the fermions are vanishing. for later use we shall represent pi and qi by

pi = c (ixi + axi) , qi = c (iyi + ayi) ,

(5)

with the eld strength fxiyi = xiayi  yiaxi = 1
c [19]. in this representation the trace in
the action is replaced with integrals over xi and yi. for our purpose, we are only interested
in the type of a trace

tr"  dx1 x

x dx2 ! ,  dy1

y  dy2 !#2

y

,

(6)

where dxi and dyi denote, in the representation given in eq. (5), covariant derivatives in
which the gauge elds depend only on x1 and y1 for i = 1, and x2 and y2 for i = 2. we
shall assume that diagonal elements, even the ones obtained as the products of matrices,

are local with respect to the coordinates x1 and y1 for the upper block and x2 and y2
for the lower block, although they are in general bi-local. we will factorize a trace as
tr = tr  tr22, and concentrate on a piece tr. there are three types of traces we have
to consider.

(i) a trace containing only diagonal elements, i.e., covariant derivatives:

tr[dxi, dyi]2 = 0z dxidyi[dxi, dyi]2,

(7)

where 0 = 1
(anti-)d2-brane worldvolume in the type iia picture [19].

2c is a normalization factor and denotes the density of d0-branes on the

2

(ii) two diagonal and two o-diagonal elements. an example is

trdx1y dy2x = 2

0z dx1dy1dx2dy2dx1y (x1, y1; x2, y2)dy2x(x1, y1; x2, y2),

(8)

where  denotes the complex conjugation, and the same rule is applied to the other cases
of this type.

(iii) four o-diagonal elements. an example is

trxy xy  = 3

0z dx1dy1dx2dy2dx2dy2x(x1, y1; x2, y2)y (x1, y1; x2, y2)

x(x1, y1; x2, y2)y (x1, y1; x2, y2), (9)

and similar results hold for the other cases.

in order to see the appearance of tachyon modes in this system, it is instructive to

compute the potential between m2 and m2 in the one-loop approximation. it can be

done most easily in the background gauge with the gauge xing term

sgf = 

r3m 6

1

p z dt

1
2

tr(cid:16)ta0 + i[bi, y i](cid:17)2

.

(10)

here the matrices y i denotes the uctuations around the background, that is, x i =
bi + y i. since we know that the tachyon modes would come from the open strings
stretched between d2 and d2 in the corresponding type iia picture, it suces to consider

the o-diagonal elements of the uctuation matrices (and ghosts as well):

y i =   0

(i)

i

0 ! , a0 =   0

() 0 ! ,  =   0



()t

then the mass matrices for the o-diagonal uctuations are given by

m 2

i = m 2
m 2

ghosts = b2 + h,

 = m 2
(8,9) =   b2 + h
4ic

(i = 1,   , 7),

4ic

b2 + h ! ,

m = 7b + 8(p1  p 2 ) + 9(q1 + q2),



0 ! .

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

where h = (p1  p 2 )2 + (q1 + q2)2, and it describes the hamiltonian of a charged
particle moving on a two-dimensional plane in the presence of a uniform magnetic eld

perpendicular to the plane. thus the energy level of the hamiltonian h is identical to
the landau level, 4c(n + 1

2) (n = 0, 1,  ).

now we can nd that the tachyon develops when m2 and m2 approach to some critical

interval, by diagonalizing the mass matrices for (8, 9)-directions:

um 2

(8,9)u =   b2 + 2c(2n + 3)

0

0

b2 + 2c(2n  1) ! ,

u =

3

1

2   i i

1 ! .

(15)

the upper eigenvalue is the mass square of the matrix   12(9 + i8), and the lower
is that of   12(9  i8). the mass square of  becomes negative for the ground state
when the interval b is shorter than 2c, and thus the ground state of  corresponds to a
complex tachyon mode in the d2-d2 pair for b < 2c [15, 16].

we can easily carry out the one-loop calculation, and the long range potential between

m2 and m2 are reliably calculated in this approximation. the result is

(16)

and the agreement with the supergravity result was found at least up to a numerical
factor [15, 16]. speaking repeatedly, the potential (16) diverges for b < 2c, and it
exhibits the tachyon instability of this system. a lesson from the one-loop computation is

that the tachyon mode appears in the uctuation  when the distance between m2 and
m2 becomes shorter than the critical value 2c.

3 the eective theory of the m 2-m 2 system
we are now interested in the region b  2c. at the critical distance b = 2c, a massless
mode comes out and it might be related to the horizon of a black hole [18]. we will mention
this point later. for the region b < 2c, a complex tachyon develops and thus it would
annihilate the m2-m2 pair by its condensation. moreover, as mentioned before, gravitons

are supposed to be produced in this process as vortices on the membrane worldvolume.

let us discuss this mechanism in the case of the coincident m2-m2 pair, that is, b = 0
case. for this purpose, it is enough to consider only the matrices x 8 and x 9, and to set
the others to zero. the action in our concern is

s(8,9) =

p z dt

the matrices x 8 and x 9 take the form

(17)

(18)

where axi and ayi denote the diagonal uctuations. it is straightforward to show that the
action (17) can be written, after setting  = 0 (dened below the eq. (15)), as

s(8,9) =

the covariant derivative dz is dened by

dy = y + iay + iay = (y1  y2) + i(ay1 + ay2) + i(ay1 + ay2),

and the eld strengthes fxy and fxy by

fxy = i[ dx, dy],

fxy = i[dx, dy],
dx = x + i ax + iax = x + i(ax1 + ax2) + i(ax1 + ax2),

coordinates of the m2 and m2 system. then the action (19) reduces to

strengthes for diagonal uctuations. when the tachyon eld  is at the lowest landau
level and the eld strengthes fxy and fxy for diagonal uctuations are vanishing, the action
(27) reduces to the sum of the tachyon potential n(||2  c)2  c2o and the total amount

the eective theory (28) of the m2-m2 system is a u(2) gauge theory with the back-

ground of a constant magnetic eld, discussed by [23, 5].

at this point we would like to note that our membrane has a topology of two-torus

[13]. the periodicity of the (anti-)membrane is given by 0  pi < cn and 0 
qi < cn (i = 1, 2) [15]. in terms of our specic representation (5) of pi and qi, the
periodicity can be read o from the formulae trn/2in/2 = 0r dx1dy1in/2 and trn/2in/2 =
0r dx2dy2in/2, and the area at 2 of torus, spanned by these coordinates, is equal to cn ,
i.e., the same as that of (pi, qi)-planes. let the periodicities of x and y be 0  x < rx and
0  y < ry respectively. then rx and ry satisfy rxry = at 2 = cn . we would like to
emphasize that the eective theory obtained in (28) is not the matrix theory compactied
on t 2. our interpretation of the eective theory is similar to the one discussed in [19], in
which it is justied that the worldvolume theory obtained via the representation (5) can

be thought of as that on the membrane itself, not on the t-dualized torus.

we would also like to remark that there is obviously a decoupled u(1) gauge eld

in the eective theory. as pointed out in [10, 11], even the decoupled u(1) here should

be eliminated in the m2-m2 annihilation. the author of [20] proposed a resolution of

this puzzle. it is not the same mechanism, but similarly we would like to point out that

the decoupled u(1) might be conned, that is, there is a mass gap and thus no massless

vector in this u(1) theory, if we can justify that this u(1) is compact and the polyakovs

argument [21] goes through as well in the case of a two-torus.

the background magnetic eld gives a t hoofts twisted boundary condition [23, 5].

we shall take the following form of the background elds:

ax =   ax

0

0 ax ! = 

1
c

y3, ay =   ay

0

0 ay ! = 0.

then the boundary conditions for these elds are given by

a(rx, y) =
a(x, ry) =

1
i
1
i

x1

y1

x + xa(0, y)1
x ,
y + ya(x, 0)1
y ,

where transition functions x and y are

x(x, y) = i2, y(x, y) = eiryx3/c,

and they satisfy a consistency condition given by t hooft [24]

x(y = 0)y(x = rx) = y(x = 0)x(y = ry)(1)n .

6

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

corresponding to these boundary conditions, we must have the boundary conditions for

the other elds via

x i=8,9(rx, y) = xx i=8,9(0, y)1

x , x i=8,9(x, ry) = yx i=8,9(x, 0)1
y ,

(34)

and we can nd that these conditions amount to

( (rx, y) = (0, y)
(rx, y) = (0, y)

,

( (x, ry) = e2iryx/c(x, 0)
(x, ry) = e2iryx/c (x, 0)

.

(35)

4 tachyon condensation and graviton production

now we shall show that there exist vortex-like solutions of the bogomolnyi-type equa-

tion (29). let us express the higgs eld  by two real valued functions u and  as
 = exp[ 1
2(u + i)]. from the rst equation in (29) the u(1) gauge eld az + az =
2 [(ax + ax)  i(ay + ay)] is described by az + az = i
1
2(x  iy).
2 | )i,
set the angular part  of the higgs eld as  = ipn

2z(u + i), where z = 1
k=1hlog 1( zzk

where the overline denotes the complex conjugation and  is a multivalued function.5
then the second equation in (29) reduces to

2 | )  log 1( zzk

c2zzu = eu + 2c2

n

xk=1

2(z  zk).

(36)

this is a liouville-type equation discussed by jackiw and pi [25], and general multi-vortex
solutions are constructed at least on r2 [25] and an explicit one-vortex solution on t 2 is
given in [26]. we, however, do not follow their constructions and adopt another strategy

in order to handle the boundary conditions of vortex solutions manifestly.

now we divide the radial part u of the higgs eld  into a singular part u0 and an

analytic part v. the singular function u0 takes the form

u0 =

(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where 2 = im and this is exactly doubly periodic [27]. the analytic function v obeys
the equation

by the theorem 7.2 of kazdan and warner [28], one can show the existence of a solution

for this equation, at least if

n

42

is suciently small.6

let us consider the boundary conditions for higgs eld . they can be easily read

o from the angular part  of the higgs eld:

 (z + 2 ) = ein+inre +ipn

 (z + 2) = ein (z) .

k=1 re(zzk) (z) ,

(39)

(40)

comparing these with (35) and noting that rx = 2 and ry = 22 = cn/2 in this
convention and that we can obviously replace x = rez in (32) and (35) with 1
k=1(x 
xk), one can nd that those conditions coincide exactly by setting n = n(= even).

n pn

c2

at this point one may wonder if a smilar analysis goes through even for the case that
 6= 0 and  = 0, that is, regardless of the existence of the tachyon.7 it is almost true.
the bogomolnyi-type equation (29) becomes dz  = 0 where dz = idx + dy, and
2 fxy + | |2 = 0, and thus we can solve it similarly. there is, however, a signicant
dierence.
in this case the angular part  ips its sign and we obtain the boundary
conditions for  with wrong sign. thus we cannot construct vortex solutions for  with
the correct boundary conditions.

now let us discuss the tachyon condensation in this system. the eective theory is

a pure u(2) gauge theory and thus it seems that the tachyon cannot condense. we can,
however, show that it eventually does. integrating (38) over t 2, we can rewrite it as

c2 n
42

at 2 = zt 2

dzdz||2.

(41)

from the above argument, we have n/42 = 1/c. therefore we can conclude that the

average value of || is equal to c. it is anticipated by the form of the tachyon potential
{(||2  c)2  c2} which we observed before, and this shows the tachyon condensation in
the m2-m2 system.

now the magnetic eld fxy on the worldvolume of the coincident m2-m2 pair is given

by fxy = n

22  2zzv, and thus the magnetic ux is

zt 2

dzdzfxy = 2n (= 2  20  at 2).

(42)

6their theorem is the following. consider a dierential equation zzv = c  hev, on riemann
surfaces, where c is a positive constant and h is an analytic function. then there exists an analytic
solution v, if and only if h is positive somewhere and c < c+(h), an upper bound depending on h. but
in our case we can expect that n/42 does not need to be small, since generic solutions of the liouville
equation (36) is known and it ensures very likely the existence of a solution of eq. (38).

7throughout this paper we are assuming c > 0.

8

this corresponds to the n-vortex solution on t 2, in which each vortex is sitting at one
of the zeros zk of the higgs eld. as is well-known, a magnetic ux on the membrane
worldvolume couples to a rr one-form via a chern-simons coupling and thus gives a

d0-brane charge in the corresponding type iia picture. the number of d0-branes corre-

sponding to the above ux is equal to n, since the value 2n of the ux is just twice the
1
c = n) on each (anti-)membrane which is constituted from

1

one (r dx1dy1

c = r dx2dy2

n/2 d0-branes. therefore the process we obtained will be

m2 (+ n/2 m-mom) + m2 (+ n/2 m-mom)

hi6=0
 gravitons (+ n m-mom),

(43)

where m-mom indicates the m-momentum, and this process in fact conserves the m-

momentum. we will justify below that vortices can be interpreted as gravitons, as denoted

in the r.h.s. of the above equation.

now let us show that vortices can be thought of as gravitons in matrix theory. the

bound for the energy is exactly zero [29]. this indicates that vortices in this system are

massless particle, and thus they can be regarded as gravitons in m-theory. it, however,

seems somewhat strange that a massless particle does not carry any energy. but remember
+ m 2)/2p. hence in matrix
that the matrix theory hamiltonian is of the form h = (p2

theory the hamiltonian of a massless particle without transverse momentum is exactly

zero, which accords with the above result. we would like to note that anti-gravitons

cannot appear in this system, since as we have shown the magnetic ux is positive. again

it is in accordance with the interpretation of matrix theory [13]. a graviton of this

type carries the m-momentum in the form of a magnetic ux r dxdyfxy, as mentioned

above, which may be reminiscent of the membrane scattering with m-momentum transfer

[30][31]. a vortex solution is, however, a static solution, as is dierent from an instanton

solution which can provide scattering processes with m-momentum transfer. hence a

vortex solution cannot describe a transfer of m-momentum.

we would also like to remark that, at the minimum of the tachyon potential, the sum of

the tension of m2 and m2 is exactly cancelled by the energy density of the tachyon eld,
as discussed in [5, 6]. we can observe it from the action (27): (here in unit 0/r3m 6
p = 1)

  4z dxdy c2.

c2 = 4z dxdy c2, (44)

(45)

this indicates the restoration of supersymmetry [5]. now let us discuss the supersymmetry

of this system. the initial state, the m2-m2 pair, breaks all of the supersymmetry. as we

showed above, it is annihilated via the tachyon condensation and gravitons are produced

9

as vortices on the membrane worldvolume. the nal state, gravitons, is a massless state,

and thus it must preserve a half of the supersymmetry. let us look at the fermion

transformation law under the supersymmetry transformations:

(46)

(47)

this shows that a vortex solution indeed preserves a half of the supersymmetry, as we

expected. note also that gravitons in matrix theory are described by a background of
commuting matrices. the above result (47) is nothing but the statement that x 8 and
x 9 are commuting for a vortex solution. again this agrees with the interpretation of a
vortex as a graviton in matrix theory.

now we would like to discuss future directions of this work. the authors in [18] pointed

out the similarity of the tachyon instability to the absorption of matters by a non-extremal

black hole. they argued that this similarity leads to the identication of the horizon of
a non-extremal black hole with a critical point (corresponding to a point b = 2c in
the m2-m2 system) where a massless mode comes out. as the horizon has a light-cone

structure, the appearance of a massless mode matches this feature. along the line of

their arguments, it would be interesting to pursue the following possibility in the m2-m2

system. we will indicate the corresponding picture in terms of a black hole in parenthesis:
set m2 and m2 innitely separated, that is, b(t = ) = . the attractive force
between m2 and m2 makes them approach up to a critical point (the horizon), b(t) = 2c,
where a massless mode appears, and subsequently they across this point (the horizon)

to exhibit the tachyon instability. then there appear vortices (gravitons radiated by a

black hole) which are time-dependent through b(t) and thus carry transverse momenta in
the region, 0 < b(t) < 2c. we expect that m2 and m2 gradually collapses to a point,
in this
b(t = ) = 0, and there remain only vortices (gravitons) as discussed above.
senario the initial energy of m2 and m2 seems to disappear, for a vortex at the nal state

does not carry any light-cone energy as mentioned before. but matrix theory is unitary

and thus the total energy of m2 and m2 must be radiated (the hawking radiation) by

10

a certain mechanism in which vortices (gravitons), in the region 0 < b(t) < 2c, carry
away the initial energy.

another direction is to study stable non-bps states [4, 6, 7, 8, 9] in matrix theory. to

do this, we need certain orbifold or orientifold projections to make a complex tachyon real

so that there can exist a kink solution on the brane  anti-brane pair. as an example it

is straightforward to apply our analysis to a matrix theory on an orientifold background

[32]. we will report some progress in this direction elsewhere [33]. it also seems possible

to discuss stable non-bps states in type i theory [6, 7] by making use of the usp(2k)

matrix model [34].

finally we would like to mention that our analysis is applicable to more general sys-

tems, such as general brane  anti-brane pairs in the iib matrix model [35] as well as

those in matrix theory.
