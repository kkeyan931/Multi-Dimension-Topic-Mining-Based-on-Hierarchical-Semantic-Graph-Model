abstract

we propose the two formalisms for obtaining the noncommutative spacetime

in a magnetic eld. one is the rst-order formalism and the other is the

second-order formalism. although the noncommutative spacetime is realized

manifestly in the rst-order formalism, the second-order formalism would be

more useful for calculating the physical quantities in the noncommutative

geometry than the rst-order one. several interesting points for string theory

and fractional quantum hall eect are discussed.

in particular, we point

out that the noncommutative geometry is closely related to the fractional

quantum hall eect(fqhe).

recently noncommutative geometry has attracted nuch interest in string and m-theory

in the b-eld [16]. gauge theory on noncommutative boundary space are relevant to the

quantization of d-branes in b elds. it is very important to notice that the noncommu-

tativity can be easily realized by turning on a magnetic eld in the plane. this situation is

also applicable to studying the fqhe [7].

in this letter we study the two models which give us the same noncommutative eect.

it is well known that the quantum mechanics of a nonrelativistic particle in a constant

magnetic eld(b = bk) produces the noncommutative momentum . hence we start with

the second-order lagrangian [8,9]

lm =

1
2

mr2 +

q
c

r  a  v (r)

(1)

where r = (x, y) is the coordinates and the vector potential (  a = b) is given by
ai = ijrjb/2. the corresponding hamiltonian is given by

2m(cid:18)p 
a(cid:19)2
here we have two momenta (p,  = mr = p  q
a gauge variant quantity and thus is not a physical observable. on the other hand  is the

c a). p is the canonical momentum which is

+ v (r).

hm =

c

mechanical momentum which is a gauge invariant quantity and thus is a physical observable.

now let us calculate the commutator of 

hi, ji = ibij

(3)

with q/c = 1. this shows that  becomes a noncommutative momentum when a magnetic
eld is turned on. however, one nds the commutative spacetime such as [ri, rj] = 0.

in order to obtain the noncommutative geometry, we take the m  0 limit [8]

lm0 = 

b

riijrj  v (r).

(4)

this is the rst-order lagrangian and thus, has a sympletic structure which enforces the

noncommutative relation [10]

[ri, rj] =

i
b

ij.

the corresponding hamiltonian hm0 is solely given by the potential

hm0 =

lm0

 r

 r  lm0 = v (r).

this can be also derived from (2) by imposing the constraint

 = mr = p + a  0.

actually (5) emerges from obtaining the same equation of motion ri =  ij
both the lagrangian formalism of (4) and the hamiltonian framework of (6).

we wish to comment the following points:

1. we note that in the limit of m  0, the phase space of four (px, py, x, y) is reduced to
two (x, y). this is so because of a consequence of the constraint (7). this implies that

there is a reduction of degrees of freedom in the noncommutative spacetime, compared

to the ordinary case. hence we expect that this leads to a negative entropy correction

in noncommutative super yang-mills theory [11].

2. the limit of m  0 with nite b is actually a projection onto the lowest landau
level(lll). in other words, the lll can be singled out by setting m  0 [8]. the
same projection is also performed by the limit of b   with nite m [9,12].

3. it is dicult to compute some physical quantities with the constraint system

(lm0,hm0). however, a similar computation with (lm,hm) may be straightfoward
because of the simpler, expanded sympletic structure. it was argued that if an op-

erator o commutes with the constraint (7) when the latter vanishes, the results in
two approaches will be the same [10]. hence it would be correct that starting with

the second-order formalism hm, and then one requires either the limit of m  0 or
the limit of b   to obtain the eect of noncommutative geometry. our previous
calculation was performed along this line [9,13]. the limiting procedure was carried

3

out through the action of c = b/2m   at the nal stage of calculation. for a
dipole conguration with the harmonic interaction [6], it would be better to use the

second-order formalism than the rst-order formalism.

4. for the string(gauge) theory calculations [6,14], we propose a new procedure with the

second-order formalism to obtain the noncommutative eect, since the calculation on

noncommutative spacetime is not easy.

5. the noncommutative spacetime (5) leads to the fqhe.

using the second-quantized formalism, one nds the hamiltonian h0

h0 =

1
2m

 (p + a)2 .

(8)

this hamiltonian is a conerstone to study the fqhe [15]. the limit of m  0 leads to
(p + a) lll = 0, which means that the fermi particles reside in the lll. a general

solution to this operator constraint is given by

lll(z, z) =

xn=0

cnn(z, z),

particle state in the lll,

where z = qb/2(x + iy), z = qb/2(x  iy), {cn, c

n(z, z) =

m} = nm. n is the n-th single

(10)

with b = 2 for convenience. since the lll wave functions {n} are incomplete in the
view of the total hilbert space (full landau levels), the elds have the unconventional

commutator [16]

2|z1  z2|2 +

lll(z1, z1), lll(z2, z2)} =

(z1z2  z2z1)(cid:19)  {z1|z2} (11)
instead of a conventional form of {(z1, z1), (z2, z2)} = 2(z1 z2). that is, a bilocal
kernel {z1|z2} is introduced as a lll analogue of the delta function and retains its
reproducing property

z d2z1f (z1){z1|z2} = f (z2)

(12)

where f (z) is any function of the form f (z) = f (z)e|z|2/2. the eld lll takes this

form and thus one nds

lll(z, z) =z d2z(z, z){z|z},

(13)

which means the overcompleteness of the lll. in other words, we cannot vary

lll(z, z) independently at dierent point (z, z) in the lll, since neighboring elds

are linked by (13). actually this overcompleteness comes from [z, z] = 1( another form

of (5)) and thus it is related to the noncommutative space.

we wish to describe the many-electron state out of any antisymmetric holomorphic

function

|fi =z " nyk=1

d2zk# f (z1, z2,   , zn )e 1

2pn

k=1 |zk|2


lll(z1)

lll(z2)    

lll(zn )|0i. (14)

thanks to the anticommutation relation (11) and the reproducing kernel (12), one

enables to to express the inner product of two such states as

hf|gi = n!z " nyk=1

d2zk# f (zk)g(zk)epn

k=1 |zk|2

.

in particular, dening the state

|z1, z2,   zni = 

lll(z1)

lll(z2)    

lll(zn )|0i,

we recover the many-electron wavefunction

(15)

(16)

hz1, z2,   zn|fi = f (z1, z2,   , zn )e 1

k=1 |zk|2

.

(17)

2pn

finally we obtain the laughlin wavefunction which is essential to the fqhe by taking

f = qk<l(zk  zl)2n+1. the key physics of the fqhe results from the rearrangement
of the nearly degenerate states{n} in the lll. here the noncommutative feature of

5

[z, z] = 1 plays an important role in constructing the holomorphic eigenfunction {n}
of hm0 in (6) [8]. hence we insist that although the fqhe is an eect of many-body
interaction, the noncommutative spacetime leads to the fqhe.

6. in order to get the moyal bracket, we introduce the charge density operator (z) =


lll(z)lll(z). and the second-quantized hamiltonian h = v is given by

v =z d2z
we commute h through lll to nd

lllv (z, z)lll(z).

itlll(z) =z d2zv (z)lll(z){z|z}.

introducing an apodized potential

ev (z1) =z d2z

we derive an analogue of the moyal bracket

in conclusion, we propose two formalisms which gives us the same noncommutative eect.

in particular, we show that the noncommutative geometry is closely related to the fqhe.
