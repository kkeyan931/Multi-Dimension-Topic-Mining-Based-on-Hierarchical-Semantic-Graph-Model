abstract

irreducible currents with arbitrary spin are constructed in general space-time dimension, in
the free-eld limit and, at the bare level, in the presence of interactions. for the n-dimensional
generalization of the (conformal) vector eld, the (n/2  1)-form is used. two-point functions
and higher-spin central charges are evaluated at one loop. as an application, the higher-
spin hierarchies generated by the stress tensor operator-product expansion are computed in
supersymmetric theories. the results exhibit an interesting universality.

introduction

the role of higher-spin symmetries in quantum eld theory is not completely clear. on the
one side stands the theory of higher-spin elds [1], which consitutes a subject in itself. recent
developments [2] have shown that a consistent formulation of higher-spin interacting elds can
be achieved at the level of the eld equations in anti-de-sitter space. on the other side stands
the higher-spin symmetry of dynamical elds with ordinary spin (0, 1/2 and 1).
it is well
known that such a symmetry must be innite to achieve the algebra closure. a famous no-go
theorem, by coleman and mandula [3], asserts that the s-matrix is trivial in the presence of a
mass gap and a higher-spin symmetry. then the theory is free. there remains to understand
whether a higher-spin symmetry does exist if the theory, or just its infrared limit, is conformal
and interacting.
in this case the coleman-mandula theorem does not apply, because the s-
matrix is not well dened. generalizations of the coleman-mandula theorem [4] assert that it
is not possible to extend the group of space-time symmetries beyond the conformal group in
non-trivial theories, but the issue is subtle in the absence of a mass gap.

higher-spin currents are naturally generated by operator-product expansions (ope) [5,
6]. usually, the currents obtained this way are not easily classiable.
in supersymmetric
theories it is possible to organize them into higher-spin current multiplets and hierarchies [7, 8].
moreover, powerful theorems [9, 10] give rigorous information about anomalous dimensions,
which parametrize the violation of the higher-spin symmetry.

so far, a closed and complete construction of irreducible higher-spin currents of spin-0,-1/2
[11] the currents are not irreducible, in [12]

and -1 elds has not been elaborated.
irreducible currents are given for the lowest spins (up to 5 included).

in refs.

this paper is devoted to the general construction of irreducible higher-spin currents and the
computation of their two-point functions. the results are applied to supersymmetric theories
and the hierarchies of current multiplets generated by the ope of the stress tensor are worked-
out. the spin and the space-time dimension are arbitrary, although we occasionally focus on
four dimensions for concreteness.

higher-spin tensor currents [11] are unique in the free-eld limit if they satisfy the conser-
vation condition and are completely traceless [12]. in particular, the two-point functions dene
the so-called higher-spin central charges, while the higher-spin hierarchies are obtained by di-
agonalizing the current multiplets via a combination of supersymmetry and orthogonalization
of the two-point functions [12, 7, 8]. the result is that the higher-spin current multiplet is
universal, the lowest-spin current being

no matter if the theory is n=4, n=2 or n=1 supersymmetric. here j v,f,s

are spin-s currents

while the highest-spin current of each multiplet is certainly universal (8j v

s ),
because it has the same structure as the stress tensor, the universal character of the lowest-spin
current is less obvious, but still an intrinsic property of supersymmetry.

this observation raises the interesting question about the preservation of such universality,
in a form to be uncovered, when the interaction is turned on. we recall that the ferrara
gattogrillonachtmann theorem [9, 10] is a sort of universality theorem for the spectrum of
the anomalous dimensions of the higher-spin currents [7, 8]. for a brief review of these issues,
see also [13].

the currents of this paper, worked out explicitly in the free-eld limit, are easily extended
to interacting theories, at the classical level and, which is the same, at the bare quantum
level. this extension is done by replacing ordinary derivatives by covariant derivatives and
extracting all traces out again. the resulting currents are non-conserved, both at the classical
and quantum levels. in families of conformal eld theories the violation of conservation is due
to the anomalous dimension.

we nd that various formulas for fermion and vector elds can be obtained from those
of the scalar elds by the simple replacements s  s  1, n  n + 2 and s  s  2, n 
n + 4, respectively, where s is the spin and n is the space-time dimension. this reduces the
computational eort by a factor 3 and justies working in general dimension.

as the n-dimensional generalization of the (conformal) vector eld, we take the (n/2  1)-
form, whose eld strength admits a decomposition into self-dual and anti-self-dual component,
useful to write down conformal currents of arbitrary spin.

in separate sections we treat: the scalar, fermion and vector elds, in sections 2, 3 and 5,
respectively, where the higher-spin currents and their two-point functions are evaluated; the
n=4 and n=2 hierarchies in sections 4, 6 and 7, where the mentioned universality is discussed
and it is shown that it makes the n=1 hierarchy straightforward; useful formulas for projectors
and conformal invariants (sect. 8). in section 9 we compute the contribution of the (n/2  1)-
form to the rst central charge c in the trace anomaly and in section 10 we collect the complete
forms of the higher-spin currents. the general properties of the (n/2  1)-form in n dimensions
are discussed in the appendix.

2 scalar eld

we write the relevant terms of the scalar current of even spin s as

s

j (s) =

ak (k) (sk) + bk  (k)

  (sk)



 + -terms +   

xk=0

with ak = ask, bk = bsk, a0 = 1
2 and b0 = 0. we omit the uncontracted indices (or replace
them by dots). the symbol (k) denotes a string of k derivatives; (k)
 is a string of k derivatives,
one of which has index . complete symmetrization in the uncontracted indices is understood.
in order to study conservation and tracelessness it is sucient to make one and two indices
explicit, respectively.

with one index explicit we have

j (s)

 =

xk=0nkak (k)

  (sk) + bk  (k)

io +    ,

here the dots stand for terms containing at least one kronecker tensor with indices dierent
from  and .

tracelessness up to -terms relates ak ad bk:

bk = 

k(s  k)
2s + n  4

ak

(1)

where n is the space-time dimension. in deriving (1) it should be remembered that ak and bk
are symmetric under k  s  k. finally, conservation determines the coecients ak recursively,
by the condition

kak + (s  k + 1)ak1 + 2bk + 2bk1 = 0,

which gives, using (1),

solved by

ak = 

(s  k + 1)(2s  2k + n  2)

(2)

(3)

we write our formulas in a convenient way for n even, although the results are valid for n odd
also. in four dimensions we get, in particular,

ak =

(1)k

k!2
2  s

,

which can be checked in the case of the stress tensor and the spin-4 scalar current worked out
in ref. [12].

summarizing, we have

j (s) =

plus terms containing at least two kronecker tensors.

now we compute the two-point functions. the form of the correlator is unique, expressible in
terms of suitable projectors or conformal tensors (see section 8 and [12]). the space-time struc-
ture, a sum of various terms constructed with x and  , contains a term x1    x2s/|x|4s+2n4
with no kronecker tensor. unicity assures that it is sucient to compute the coecient of such
a term in the two-point functions, which reduces the eort considerably.

2  2(cid:1)!(cid:3)2 .

(2s)!(cid:2)(cid:0) n

this is the most dicult sum that we meet here. observe that under the replacement p  s  p
the sum picks up a factor (1)s. we have used mathematica to compute this sum symbolically
for p = 0 (and p = s). the symbolic calculation, equivalent to the use of the available talbes,
is however more dicult for the other values of p. once more, we have checked the result
numerically for other values up to (s, n) = (50, 50) and all values of p  s in this range. we do
not know how to rigorously show that the simple p-dependence of this sum is the claimed one.
this would suce to complete the proof. all our general results for the two-point functions
rely on the sum above, while the other sums that we meet can be treated with the known tables
or with a symbolic calculation. a cross-check of (6) will come from supersymmetry.

the sum can be written more simply as

s

(1)q (p + q + k)!(2s  p  q + k)!
xq=0
q!(s  q)!(q + k)!(s  q + k)!

= (1)p,

where k = n/2  2.

this result reduces the computation of f [s, n] to a sum of the form

changing the normalization appropriately, we have checked the agreement with the results of
[12] for s = 0, 2, 4 in n = 4. the above formula, derived for even spin, extends to odd spin also.
this will be shown later on, using supersymmetry.

the two normalizations, of this paper and of ref. [12], are related as follows. here we have,

from formula (4):

j (s) =

having used (7). in ref. [12] we had

in particular, we have in four dimensions

worked out in [12] up to spin 5.

we now proceed with the computation of the two-point function of the spin-s current. the

the same sum as in the scalar case appears, and we conclude

plus -terms. it can be checked that the sign is in agreement with reection positivity and for
this purpose it is worth to observe that the odd-spin currents are purely imaginary in our
notation. the above formula agrees with the results of [12] up to spin 5 included.

let us relate the two normalizations. here we have, from (10) and (7):

j (s) =

5 vector eld and its generalization to arbitrary dimension

the vector eld a is not conformal in dimension dierent from 4. as the generalization of the
four-dimensional vector eld to arbitrary (even) dimension, it is better to take the (n/2  1)-
form a1...l1, where s = 2l. this theory is indeed conformal. the l  1 indices are completely
antisymmetrized and this vector has the usual gauge-invariance. the eld strength reads

f1...l = 1 a2...l  2a13...l  3 a214...l +   

and the lagrangian is

the stress tensor,

l =

 f 2,

is traceless, as claimed. here {} denotes collectively a string of l 1 indices and repeated {}s
denote contracted indices. the contraction is done with the identity in the space of tensors
with (l  1)-antisymmetric indices (see the appendix).

we can now proceed to construct the higher-spin currents. as we explain in the appendix,
the four-dimensional formalism extends straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension multiple of 4,
but also l=odd does not present problems if complex elds are considered. we therefore assume
that l=even and the results will extend immediately to l=odd. in particular, the stress tensor
can be written as

t = 2f +

{}f 

{},

without care about the positions of the indices  and . the same can be said of the currents
with arbitrary spin. conservation and tracelessness are evident.

we write the relevant terms of the current of spin s as

the currents as in [12, 7]:

where s is any even integer number. in addition, the stress tensor is a current multiplet in itself
and is in practice 2. note that the capital greek letters are not used here in the same way as
in ref. [7].

we conventionally x the normalization so that the scalar component of the highest-spin

current has coecient 1:

6(as + 16bs + 24cs) = 1.

secondly, we impose that multiplets with dierent spins be orthogonal. the conditions

hs si = 0 and hs+2 s+2i = 0 give, respectively,

0 =

(as  8cs)bs+2 + (as  8bs  24cs)cs+2.

the three conditions are solved uniquely by as, bs, cs such that

s =

in agreement with the results of [7]. the remaining orthogonality relationships are automatically
satised, which is also a cross-check of the formula for f [s, n].

the orthogonalized two-point functions dene the so-called higher-spin central charges,

in particular

hs(x) s(0)i =

24s10(s!)2(s + 1)!(s + 2)!

note that the curious s   limit

s (cid:17) .

7 the n=2 vector multiplet

we conclude the applications with the hierarchy of the n=2 vector multiplet [8]. the fermion
and vector currents are the same as in (17) (with i = 1, 2 now) and the scalar currents are

j s

s = m


 sm + n


 sn + impr.,

as

s = 2im


 sn + impr..

(20)

we also have odd-spin currents for scalar elds. we determine their two-point functions using
supersymmetry, as in [8].

the supersymmetry operation is

j s
2s  2 af
2s  8 av

(j  a when s is odd) we impose the normalization as + 8bs + 8cs = 4 and orthogonality
(hs+1 s+1i = hs si = 0). the result is

s =

(21)

comparing (13), (18) and (21) we observe an unexpected universality of the higher-spin

hierarchy. the lowest spin is always

8s(s  1)

(s + 1)(s + 2)

j v

s +

s ,

(22)

and theories with dierent supersymmetric contents just dier in restrictions such as the parity
of s, the presence or absence of the vector currents j v
s , the overall normalization, etc.. for
example, s takes any integer value in the n=2 vector multiplet, but only even values in the
n=4 multiplet and in the hypermultiplet.

observe that the highest-spin component of the current multiplets (8j v

s ) is also
universal and independent of the spin. this follows from the universality of the stress tensor.
the highest-spin currents are annihilated, by denition, by the supersymmetry transformation
and the unique structure with this property is that of the stress tensor.

s 2j f

s +j s

in conclusion, the innite ope algebra of (supersymmetric) conformal eld theory in higher
dimensions is uniquely described by the simple, universal, structure (22). it is plausible that
the universality that we have uncovered is much deeper.
it should be an intrinsic property
of supersymmetry, since the highest-spin/lowest-spin two-point function (hs si for n=4 and
hs si for n=2) is proportional to the dierence 2nv  4nf + ns between the number of
bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom (nv,f,s being the number of vectors, dirac fermions
and real scalars, respectively).

this observation extends immediately to n=1 hierarchies. indeed, n=1 supersymmetric
multiplets contain only two types of elds (vector, fermion for the vector multiplet and fermion,
scalar for the scalar multiplet), and the universality of the highest-spin current, together with
orthogonality, implies immediately the universality of the lowest-spin current. this fact is not
obvious, instead, in extended supersymmetry. the current multiplets are

8s(s1)
(s+1)(s+2) j v

s + 2s
s+1  2 j f

s+1j f
s+1

s

8j v

,

2s
s+1 j f

s + j s
s
s+1 + j s

2 j f

s+1

,

for the vector and scalar multiplets, respectively, up to normalization factors. here s takes any
integer value.

a byproduct of the calculations of this section is the extension of the scalar two-point
functions, (8) and (9), which we have derived for even spin, to odd spin (and complex scalar
elds), with the normalization specied in (20). this result is implied by orthogonality of the
odd-spin components of the n=2 vector-eld current multiplets.

8 formulas for projectors and conformal tensors

in this section we work out formulas to express the two-point functions in the notation of [12]
and write them down in complete form (including the -terms).

1s,1s, which are dened as the unique 2s indiced poly-
nomials of degree 2s in derivatives, completely symmetric, conserved and traceless in 1    s

we start from the projectors q(s)

13

and 1    s. we write them in compact notation as q(s)

2 ]
[ s

{},{} and we expand them as

y(s)

{},{}

akk

k

  s2k



.

(23)

=

xk=0

here k
 denotes a string of k projectors  =    2, with indices from the set {}.
the normalization is conventionally xed so that a0 = 1. expression (23) is automatically
conserved and we have to impose tracelessness. for this purpose, we can make two indices of
the set {}, say  and , explicit:

y(s)

s2k2



tracing in  and  we get the recursion relation

ak = ak1

(s  2k + 2)(s  2k + 1)

2k(2s  2k + n  3)

(24)

in generic dimension n. the solution is

ak = (1)k

(2s  2k + n  4)! s! (cid:0)s + n

k! (s  2k)! (cid:0)s  k + n

2  2(cid:1)! (2s + n  4)!

2  2(cid:1)!

,

which correctly reproduces the values of [12] for n = 4 and s = 0, . . . , 5.

it can be shown, using the known tables, that

[ s
2 ]

xk=0

ak =

2s(s + n  4)!(cid:0)s + n
2  2(cid:1)!
(cid:0) n
2  2(cid:1)!(2s + n  4)!

and the general space-time structure of the two-point function hj (s)
currents is

{}(x) j (s)

{}(0)i of the spin-s

{},{}(cid:18)
y(s)

|x|2n4(cid:19) =

2  2(cid:1)!(2s + n  4)!

(n  3)!(cid:0) n

2  2(cid:1)!

this allows us to convert the formulas of the previous sections, (8), (9), (11), (12), (15) and
(16), in the more elegant notation of [12]. for example (19) can be re-expressed as

+ -terms.

hs(x) s(0)i =

2s10(s + 1)!(s + 2)!

9(2s + 1)(2s + 3)! y(s)(cid:18) 1

|x|4(cid:19) .

an equivalent way to express the two-point functions is by using the conformal tensor
i (s)
1s,1s(x), rst introduced by ferrara et al. in refs. [6], which we write in compact form
as

2 ]
[ s

i (s)
{},{}(x) =

bkk

k

 i s2k



(x),

(25)

xk=0

14

where the powers k and s  2k denote the number of kronecker tensors and the number of
tensors i(x) =   2xx/|x|2, respectively. the tensor i(x) [14] is indeed the building
block of all conformal tensors. we normalize (25) with b0 = 1. the formal structure is the same
as in (23), upon suitable symbolic replacements. tracing, we get the same recursion relation as
(24), but with n  n + 1. the solution is therefore

bk = (1)k

s! (cid:0)s  k + n

2  2(cid:1)!
22kk! (s  2k)! (cid:0)s + n

2  2(cid:1)!

.

we have i (s)

{},{}(x) = (1)s2sx1    x2s/|x|2s+-terms, and the complete conversion formula

reads

{},{}(cid:18)
y(s)

1

|x|2n4(cid:19) =

the square of the conformal tensor i (s)

(1)s22s(2s + n  3)!(s + n  4)!(cid:0)s + n
2  2(cid:1)!(2s + n  4)!

(n  3)!(cid:0) n

we write

the tracelessness condition shows immediately that the ck are proportional to the bk. the
normalization of (s)

this is easy to calculate. indeed, only the rst term of (s)

therefore c0 = 1 and the ck are precisely equal to the bk of (1).

9 trace anomaly

in this section we work out the contribution of the generalized vector eld to the rst central
charge, called c, in the trace anomaly. the charge c provides the integrated trace anomaly at

15

the quadratic level in the expansion around at space. the topological invariants and the more
important central charge a (see [13] for the denition and a quick introduction), instead, are
not visible in this formula.

10 complete form of the higher-spin currents

finally, we give the complete expressions of the higher-spin currents, including the -terms.
the derivation follows the strategy of the previous sections, which should be familiar by now,
and therefore we just report the result.

we can write in compact notation, for a complex scalar eld,

 being the conserved projector   2, as usual. here we choose a0 = 1. conservation of
j (s) is implicit. tracelessness gives the same recursion relation as in (24). the coecients
for the spinor and vector cases are easily obtained from the scalar ones with the replacements

note that the formula for the trace:

it is possible to dene a dual eld-strength,

as well as self-dual and anti-self-dual tensors

f

(f1...l  f1...l),

17

so that the stress tensor reads

t = f +

observe that only in dimension multiple of 4, the two terms of this sum are equal. indeed, we
have

1...l,

for l= even,

for l= odd,

(27)

(28)

where m  is any self-dual/anti-self-dual tensor in the sense specied above.

the eld equations f1...l1 = 0 and bianchi identities  f1...l1 = 0 can be written

in the form f 

1...l1 = 0. for l=even, we can write the stress tensor as

t = 2f +

{}f 

{},

without care about the positions of the indices  and . the same can be said of the currents
with arbitrary spin. the proof of this statement follows from the equality

m +

{}n 

{} = m +

{}n 

{},

which can be shown using (27) for l=even, with the bonus

m +

1...ln 

1...l = 0

(l= even),

(29)

(30)

here m and n are generic self-dual and anti-self-dual tensors, respectively.

in l=even conservation of the stress-tensor is obvious and tracelessness follows from (30).
this means that the current-formalism of four dimensions generalizes straightforwardly to ar-
bitrary dimension multiple of four.

if l is even the instanton equation

f +

1...l = 0

(31)

is meaningful. if l is odd, instead, (28) implies that self-dual and anti-self-dual tensors are not
independent of each other, so that if (31) holds, then f 
1...l also vanisehs and there are only
trivial solutions. it is possible, nevertheless, to have a nontrivial notion of instanton in l=odd
by considering complex elds.

so, let us assume that for l=odd the eld is complex. in real notation we have two elds

ai

1...l1, i = 1, 2. the eld strength f i

1...l is dened as above, but now

f i

1...l =

1

2 (cid:18)f i

1...l 

1
l!

ij1...l1...lf j

now we have a good version of (27),

m i

1...l =

l!

ij1...l1...lm j

1...l.

18

the stress tensor reads

t = 2f +i

{}f i

{}

and everything else generalizes immediately, in particular formulas (29) and (30). the instanton
equations are non-trivial.

all this is natural, because in two dimensions our generalized vector eld reduces to the
free (complex) scalar . self-duality (anti-self-duality) of the eld strength f +i
 = 0)
is the holomorphicity (anti-holomorphicity) condition on . these observations might be useful
to estabilish correspondences between instantons in dierent dimensions.
