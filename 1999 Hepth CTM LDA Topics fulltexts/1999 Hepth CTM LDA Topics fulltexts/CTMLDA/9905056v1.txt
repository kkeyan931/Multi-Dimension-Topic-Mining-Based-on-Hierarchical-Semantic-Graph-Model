abstract

recently the space-time congurations of a set of non-threshold bound

states, called the (f, dp) bound states, have been constructed explicitly for

every p with 2  p  7 in both type iia (for p even) and type iib (for p
odd) string theories by the present authors. by making use of the sl(2, z)

symmetry of type iib theory we construct a more general sl(2, z) invariant

bound state of the type ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) in this theory from the (f, d5)

bound state. there are actually an innite number of (m, n) strings forming

bound states with (m, n) 5-branes, where strings lie along one of the spatial

directions of the 5-branes. by applying t-duality along one of the transverse

directions we also construct the bound state ((f, d2), (kk, d6)) in type

iia string theory. then we give a list of possible bound states which can be

obtained from these newly constructed bound states by applying t-dualities

along the longitudinal directions as well as s-dualities to those in type iib

theory.

i. introduction

this is in sequel to our series of study on a new kind of bound states that exist in

both type iia and type iib string theories. in [1], we have provided arguments from the

worldvolume point of view, that there exist bps bound states of dp branes carrying certain

units of quantized constant electric elds, called the (f, dp) bound states, for every p with

1  p  8 in type iia (for p even) and type iib (for p odd) string theory. the explicit space-
time congurations of these bound states have been constructed explicitly for 2  p  7
in [2]1. each of these bound states preserve one half of the space-time supersymmetries.

in the worldvolume picture the f in (f, dp) represents the uniform and constant electric

eld lines owing along, say, x1 axis of the dp-brane due to the uniform and homogeneous
charge distribution on the rest of the (p  1) plane placed at x1 = , originating from
an innite number of open strings ending on this surface. on the other hand, the space-

time conguration allows us to identify these eld lines with the innitely long fundamental

strings or f-strings in the bulk. to make this identication more concrete, we have calculated

the charges carried by f-strings, dp-branes as well as the mass per unit p-brane volume and

have shown that they match precisely with what we expect from the worldvolume study. we

have noted in [1], that since type iib theory is conjectured to possess an sl(2, z) invariance,

there must exist more general bound states than (f, dp) in this theory. by making use of

this observation, we have constructed the more general non-threshold bound state of the

type ((f, d1), d3) and some of its t-dual descendants in [8].

in this paper, we make an sl(2, z) transformation on the non-threshold bound state

(f, d5) in type iib theory to construct ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) bound state. the space-time

conguration consisting of the metric, the dilaton, the axion and the other non-vanishing

1the congurations for p = 3, 4, 6 were also given previously in [35], respectively. similar non-

threshold bound states in m theory or type iia/iib theory for a p-brane within another p-brane

with p < p were studied in [37].

2

gauge elds for this bound state are constructed explicitly. the initial (f, d5) conguration

consists of an innite number of ns strings (each ns string is actually q f-strings) distributed

uniformly over s d5-branes and lying along one of the spatial directions of d5-brane, where

q and s are relatively prime integers as discussed in [2]. we here consider a genuine initial

(f, d5) bound states, i.e., both q and s are non-zero2. in general, we expect that in the

bound state ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)), there are innite number of (m, n) strings lying along

one of the spatial directions of (m, n) 5-branes. here both (m, n) and (m, n) are relatively

prime integers corresponding to the charges associated with the nsns and rr gauge elds

of the strings and 5-branes respectively. however, for a genuine initial (f, d5) bound state,

i.e. when at least one of m, n and one of m, n are non-zero, we nd that a consistent

quantization of the charges associated with the nsns and rr gauge elds of both the

strings and the 5-branes relates the charges of the strings with those of the 5-branes. as a

result the relatively prime integers (m, n) corresponding to the electric charges of the strings

determine the relatively prime integers (m, n) corresponding to the magnetic charges the

5-branes in the form m = n and n = m. this fact in turn tells us that the existence of
bound states between m fundamental strings and n d-strings may imply the existence of

bound states between n ns5-branes (or n ns5-branes with opposite orientation) and m
d5-branes. thus the sl(2, z) invariant bound state ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) of type iib theory

in this case is characterized by a pair of relatively prime integers (m, n) or (m, n). we can

obtain the other bound states, namely, (f, d5) and (d1, ns5) from this general solution by

setting m = 1, n = 0 and n = 1, m = 0 respectively. but because the charges of the strings

and the 5-branes are related as mentioned above, we cannot have bound states of the form

2for the degenerate q = 0, s 6= 0 case, the resulting conguration is the (ns5, d5) bound state
given in [9]. for the degenerate q 6= 0, s = 0 case, the resulting conguration is the sl(2, z) strings
[6] with four additional isometries from the (f, d5). we will give these degenerate congurations

right after the ((f, d1), (ns5, d5) for the purpose of discussion in section 3.

(f, ns5) and (d1, d5) consistent with the fact that these bound states preserve 1/4 rather

than 1/2 of the spacetime supersymmetries.

the descendants of this bound state could be obtained by applying t-duality along

various transverse and longitudinal directions. we give an explicit construction of the bound

states ((f, d2), (kk, d6)) in type iia theory by applying t-duality in one of the transverse

directions3. we point out the problem of taking further t-dualities along the transverse

directions. finally, we give a list of possible other descendant bound states which can be

obtained from these by t-dualities in various longitudinal directions as well as s-dualities

to those in type iib theory.

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we use the sl(2, z) invariance of type

iib theory to construct the non-threshold ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) bound state starting from

the (f, d5) one. we show that (f, d5) and (d1, ns5) bound states can be obtained from

this bound state as special cases. we also give the sl(2, z) invariant 5-branes and the sl(2,

z) invariant strings. in section 3, we apply t-duality on ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) bound state

along one of the transverse directions to construct ((f, d2), (kk, d6)) bound state. since

we have shown how to implement s- and t-dualities in general, we here list all the possible

bound states that can be obtained from the abovementioned bound states by the application

of t-dualities in various longitudinal directions and s-dualities to those belonging to type

iib theory. we conclude this paper in section 4.

ii. sl(2, z) invariance and non-threshold ((f, d1), (ns5, d5))

bound state

in this section, we will use the sl(2, z) symmetry of type iib theory to construct the

non-threshold bound state ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) from the explicit solution (f, d5) given

3the degenerate congurations (f, d2) and (kk, d6) can be obtained from the corresponding

ones discussed in the previous footnote by the same t-duality.

4

in [2]. we will follow the procedure outlined in [6], [10], [11]. let us begin with (f, d5)

solution [2] given by the metric,

ds2 = h1/2 h 1/4 hh1(cid:16)(dx0)2 + (dx1)2(cid:17) + h1(cid:16)(dx2)2 + (dx3)2 + (dx4)2 + (dx5)2(cid:17)

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

+dyidyii ,

with i = 1, 2, 3, 4; the dilaton,

e = h1/2,

and the remaining non-vanishing elds,

h (1)
3 = q1/2
20q5
h (2)
3 = s

0

3,

(q,s) dh1  dx0  dx1,

3
h5 = qs1
(q,s) h2 dh  dx2  dx3  dx4  dx5.

note that in writing this solution we have consistently set the scalars b0 = b0 = 0, as

they have nothing to do with the dilaton and the axion in the theory [2]. also in the above

h (1)

3 and h (2)

3 are the nsns and rr 3-form eld strengths. h5 is the self-dual 5-form eld-

strength with h5 = h5, where  denotes the hodge dual. h is a harmonic function given
by

h = 1 +

q5
r2 ,

(2.4)

where r2 = yiyi and q5 = 1/2

0/(23), h is another harmonic function dened as

(q,s)20q5
q2 + s2h

(q,s)

h =

= 1 +

s2q5/(q,s)

r2

,

(2.5)

with (q,s) = q2 + s2. here q and s are two relatively prime integers denoting respectively

the quantized ns string charge or the number of f-strings per (2)42 of four dimensional

area perpendicular to the strings in (f, d5) and the d5-brane charge as discussed in [2]. n

denotes the volume form on an n-sphere whereas n is the volume of a unit n-sphere and is

given as,

5

n =

(2)(n+1)/2

( n+1
2 )

.

(2.6)

also, 20 = (2)7/22 and the unit charge for a dp-brane is qp

0  (2)(72p)/2(3p)/2.

the electric charge of the f-strings in (f, d5) bound state can be calculated as,

e(1) =

1

20 zr4s 3(cid:16)e  h (1)

3 + h (2)

3  b4(cid:17) .

(2.7)

but as mentioned in [2], this expression is in fact innite as there are innite number of

f-strings in (f, d5). however, we can still dene a quantized nite charge from (2.7) in the

form as given below [2]

q(1) = (2)42

e(1)

20a4

= qtf ,

(2.8)

with tf = 1/(2) the fundamental string tension. here a4 = r dx2dx3dx4dx5 is the

coordinate area of x2x3x4x5-plane. the charge q(1) represents the number of f-strings per

(2)42 area over x2x3x4x5-plane measured in some units (note the f-strings lie along the

x1-axis). also the quantized magnetic charge of the d5-brane is given as,

p (2) = g(2) =

1

20 zs 3

h (2)

3 = sq5
0

(2.9)

it is well-known that type iib supergravity possesses a classical cremmer-julia [12] sym-

metry group sl(2, r). a discrete subgroup sl(2, z) is now believed [13] to survive in the

full quantum type iib string theory. under a global sl(2, r) symmetry the einstein metric

g is a singlet, the two 3-form eld strengths h (1)
3

and h (2)
3

transform as a doublet and

the 5-form eld strength is also a singlet. so, the transformations of the various elds along

with the two scalars, the dilaton () and the axion (, the rr scalar) parameterizing the

coset sl(2, r)/so(2) dened as m = e

are:

(2.10)

where  is a global sl(2, r) transformation matrix and t  denotes the transpose of a

matrix.

let us next look at how the charges would transform under the global sl(2, r) trans-

formation. since a general sl(2, z) invariant conguration will have both (f, d1) strings

(innite numbers of them) living on (ns5, d5) branes, the charge expression in (2.7) will

be modied to give electric charges of both f-string and d-string as,

e(i) =

1

20 zr4s 3(cid:16)mij  h (j)

3 + ijh (j)

3  b4(cid:17)

(2.11)

where i, j = 1, 2 and ij is the sl(2, r) invariant totally antisymmetric tensor with 12 = 1.

as before, e(i) is not well-dened and we can dene the quantized charges as,

q(i) =

(2)42e(i)
20a4

(2.12)

the quantized magnetic charges of the ns5-brane and d5-brane can now be obtained as,

p (i) = g(i) =

1

20 zs 3

h (i)
3

(2.13)

note that the electric charge in (2.11) or (2.12) is a noether charge and follows from the

equation of motion whereas the magnetic charge is topological and follows from bianchi

identity. it is clear from (2.10) that the electric charges of (f, d1) strings and the magnetic

charges of (ns5, d5) branes would transform as,

q(1)

q(2)







p (1)

p (2)







 q  q;

 p  (1)tp

(2.14)

now in order to obtain the global sl(2, r) transformation matrix 0, we start with the zero
asymptotic values of the dilaton and the axion i.e. m(initial)
matrix and demand that 0 will transform it into a xed but arbitrary value as

= i, where i is the identity

(2.16)

note that once we apply sl(2, r) transformation on the initial quantized charges (2.8)

and (2.9) of (f, d5) by eq.(2.14), the charges will no longer remain quantized. in order to

get around this problem, one either needs to introduce compensating factors in place of both

the charges q and s or replace q and s by arbitrary classical charges as 1/2

(m,n) and 1/2

(m,n)

respectively, where s are the arbitrary numbers and will be determined in the process of

charge quantization [14]. by imposing that the transformed charges are integers4, namely,

(m, n) for strings and (m, n) for the 5-branes we have from (2.14)

we assume the initial (f, d5) to be non-degenerate, both 1/2

(m,n) and 1/2

(m,n) are non-

vanishing. in other words, at least one of m, n and one of m, n are non-zero. eqs.(2.17)

and (2.18) determine the form of 1

(2.19)

and

[15] and 5-branes [9] to form non-threshold bound states.

note that in the process of obtaining (2.19) and (2.20), the so(2) angle got xed as,

ei = h(m  0n)e0/2 + ine0/2i 1/2
= h(n + 0m)e0/2  ime0/2i 1/2

(m,n)

(m,n)

(2.20)

(2.21)

from the above equation we nd that the -factors associated with the strings and the

5-branes are given as,

(m,n) = e0(m  0n)2 + e0n2
(m,n) = e0(n + 0m)2 + e0m2

(2.22)

since the strings and 5-branes are transformed simultaneously by the same sl(2, r) matrix,

so it is clear from eqs.(2.19) and (2.20) that the corresponding charges must be related as,

also, in this case

m = n

n = m

(m,n) = (n,m) = (m,n)

(2.23)

(2.24)

it can be easily checked that both (m,n) and (m,n) are sl(2, z) invariant. now once we

nd the sl(2, r) transformation matrix 0 given either by eq.(2.19) or by (2.20), we can

obtain the general ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) conguration by applying the sl(2, r) transforma-

tion given in eq.(2.10) on the initial (f, d5) conguration. as mentioned earlier, the initial

(f, d5) conguration as given in eqs.(2.1)(2.6) should be modied by the appropriate 

factors or more precisely, q should be replaced by 1/2

(m,n) and s by 1/2

(m,n). keeping this

in mind the nal ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) non-threshold bound state is given by the following

metric

ds2 = h1/2 h 1/4 hh1(cid:16)(dx0)2 + (dx1)2(cid:17) + h1(cid:16)(dx2)2 + (dx3)2 + (dx4)2 + (dx5)2(cid:17)

(2.28)

(2.29)

(2.30)

(2.31)

we note that the metric in (2.25) retains its form after sl(2, r) transformation except

for the introduction of the appropriate -factors as expected. the 5-form eld strength

h5 = h5 in (2.28) is sl(2, r) invariant. also, from (2.26) and (2.27) we nd that as
r  , e  e0 and   0, the corresponding asymptotic values as it should be. let us

10

now discuss how the (f, d5) and (d1, ns5) bound states can be obtained from this general

conguration as special cases.

from the above solution given by (2.25)(2.31), we can obtain (f, d5) bound state by

setting m = 1 and n = 0. note that the charges associated with the f-strings and the

5-branes are unity and we can not have this bound state with arbitrary charges because of

the relations (2.23). similarly, the other bound state (d1, ns5) can be obtained by setting

m = 0 and n = 1. again we can not have arbitrary charges for d-strings and ns5-brane

because of the charge relations (2.23). however, since string charges are related to the 5-

brane charges, we can not get (f, ns5) or (d1, d5) bound states and this is consistent

with the fact that these congurations break 1/4 of the spacetime supersymmetries as can

be inferred from that of the bound state of (d0, d4) discussed in [16,17].

it should be

pointed out that for both m, n non-zero, the existence of (m, n) string bound states seem

to imply the existence of (n, m) 5-brane bound states. this is nice since the existence
of 5-brane bound state is not easy to establish considering the unrenormalizability of six

dimensional sym theory and our poor understanding of the solitonic 5-branes. however,

some interesting scenario for the existence of 5-brane bound states has been suggested in

[18].

for the use of the following section, we here present the degenerate (ns5, d5) and (f,

d1) congurations. note that these degenerate cases can also be obtained from the above

construction by setting m = n = 0 (for (ns5, d5)) and m = n = 0 (for (f, d1)) at the

outset, respectively. in the former case (m,n) = 0 and the sl(2, r) transformation matrix

0 is determined from eq.(2.18) alone. whereas, for the latter case (m,n) = 0 and 0

is determined from eq.(2.17) alone. thus for (ns5, d5), the harmonic functions take the

form,

h = h = 1 +

h = 1 +

(2.32)

this is the (m, n) string or (f, d1) bound state solution of schwarz [6] but now with

isometries in x2, x3, x4, x5 directions.

iii. the descendants of ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) bound state

the t-duality rules for various bps solutions along both longitudinal and transverse

directions in type iia/iib theories can be described by the following table (for kk monopole,

the transverse direction is taken to be the nut direction),

in this table w, f, ns5 and kk denote waves, fundamental strings, ns vebranes, and
kk monopoles, respectively, and they are associated with nsns elds. dp (1  p  8)5
are the so-called d-branes and they are associated with rr elds.

using the above table, we will give in this section, as a further example, the explicit space-

time conguration of ((f, d2), (kk, d6)) bound state in type iia theory by performing

t-duality on the ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) bound state along one of its transverse directions and

then give the list of other possible bound states towards the end. the general method of

performing t-duality has already been described at length in [2]. we here briey outline

the method for completeness. t-duality along the transverse direction is performed by the

use of the so-called vertical dimensional reduction and the diagonal or double dimensional

oxidation method. let us start with a p-brane (in our case it is the more complicated

((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) brane) solution in type iia (iib) theory. we then use the no-force

condition of the bps states to construct a multi-center solution from the single center one

with an innite periodic array of p-branes placed along the transverse direction. then we

take a continuum limit to obtain the p-brane solution with one isometry along the would-

be compactied direction where the solution is now independent of this coordinate. this

process in turn reduces the dimensionality of the theory to d = 9, known as the vertical

dimensional reduction. once we have this solution, we perform the t-duality transformation

5we do not consider d9 or the space-time lling branes [19]

on various elds to write them from iia (iib) basis to iib (iia) basis. then by the so-called

double-dimensional oxidation, we can simply read o the d = 10 (p + 1)-brane solution from

the d = 9 solution. one can also apply t-duality along the longitudinal directions of the

p-brane and obtain new bound states by the method of diagonal reduction and vertical

oxidation, just opposite to the previous case.

((f, d2), (kk, d6)) bound state: here we assume that the (ns5, d5) in the

original ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) bound state is aligned along x1, x2, x3, x4 and x5 direction

and we apply t-duality along x6 direction (assuming (f, d1) to be aligned along the x1-

direction). then following the procedure just outlined [2], we nd that this bound state in

type iia theory is given by the following einstein metric,

ds2 = e0/8h 1/4h5/8h1/8hh1(cid:16)(dx0)2 + (dx1)2(cid:17) + h1n(dx2)2 +    + (dx5)2

as discussed in the previous section for ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)), we can set either m or n

to zero in the above but not both simultaneously. the same is true for the bound state ((f,

d2), (kk, d6)). as before we can obtain (f, d6) bound state from (3.1)(3.4) by setting

m = 1 and n = 0 (note that the rst term in the rst equation of (3.3) will not contribute

for this case which can be seen from eqs.(2.27) and (2.31)) and similarly, for m = 0, n = 1

we get (d2, kk) bound state. for each of these bound states the constituent branes have

unit charges. we can also have degenerate (f, d2) and (kk, d6) congurations which can

be obtained from the (f, d1) and (ns5, d5) by the same t-duality. for the (kk, d6), the

harmonic functions in this case have the forms,

(3.8)

the eqs.(3.5), (3.6) and the eqs.(3.7), (3.8) represent respectively the (kk, d6) bound

state and (f, d2) bound state with isometries along x2, x3, x4, x5 directions. again as

before, we can not get (f, kk) and (d2, d6) bound states since they preserve only 1/4 of

15

the spacetime supersymmetries. note that in order for the above metric eq. (3.1) to be free
from conical singularity, x6 should have a period of 4n(20q6

0/2).

at the level of supergravity solution as discussed in [2], we may expect that we can make

a further t-duality on ((f, d2), (kk, d6)) along one of the transverse directions of the

d6 branes6. it is obvious from the metric eq. (3.1) that we have an isometry /. but

t-duality along this direction would result in a complicated metric which depends on the

angle 7. we do not have a clear interpretation for the resulting conguration. we therefore

do not consider this t-duality here. apart from this possible t-duality, it is not obvious to

us if we can have any other simple t-duality as described above along a transverse direction.

now we give the list of all possible descendants of ((f1, d1), (ns5, d5)) and ((f, d2),

(kk, d6)) by applying t-dualities along various longitudinal directions of each of these two

bound states. we will follow the notation of [8]. for example, (ti :7) will denote t-duality
along i-th direction. we assume that the bound state ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) is along x1, x2,

x3, x4 and x5 directions and (f, d1)-strings are along x1-direction. then according to the

table given in the beginning of this section, we can t-dualize each of the above ((f, dp),

(ns5/kk, d(p+4))), with 1  p  2 (for p = 1 we have ns5-state and for p = 2 we have
kk-state), along longitudinal directions of the original (ns5, d5)- branes to obtain new

bound states. but since strings are along x1-directions, we will get dierent bound states

depending on whether we t-dualize 1 direction rst or not. t-dualizing along 1 we get,

for example, the following bound state

((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) (t1 :7) ((w, d0), (ns5, d4)).

(3.9)

we can also apply t-duality along longitudinal directions other than 1 rst and then apply

t-duality along 1. for example, if we t-dualize along 5 rst and then along 1 we get,

((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) (t5 :7) ((f, d2), (ns5, d4)) (t1 :7) ((w, d1), (ns5, d3)).

(3.10)

6if we t-dualize along the nut direction, we are back to ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)).

7we would like to thank chris pope for pointing this out to us.

16

where the d2 and d4 in ((f, d2), (ns5, d4)) share only one common direction while the d1

and d3 in ((w, d1), (ns5, d3) share no common directions. repeating the above process

to ((f, d2), (ns5, d4) along 4 rst then along 1, we end up with ((f, d3), (ns5, d3))

and ((w, d1), (ns5, d3)). continuing this, we have in general ((w, dp), (ns5, d(4  p))
and ((f, d(p + 1)), (ns5, d(5  p)) for 0  p  4. applying the similar process to ((f,
d2), (kk, d6)), we have in general ((w, d(p + 1)), (kk, d(5  p)) and ((f, d(2 + p)),
(kk, d(6  p)) for 0  p  4.

this exhausts all the possibilities.

in summary, we have the following list of all pos-

sible bound states which can be obtained by t-duality along one transverse and various

longitudinal directions on ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)):

where the second column indicates the number of common directions shared by the

respective d-branes in the bound states. also in the above 0  p  4. if we write the above
bound states in the form ((x, y), (z, v)), then from the properties of ((f, d1), (ns5, d5))

discussed, we can get (x, v) by setting m = 1, n = 0, (y, z) by setting m = 0, n = 1.

the degenerate (z, v) and (x, y) congurations can be obtained by applying t-dualities

along the longitudinal directions, in a similar fashion, of either (f, d1) or (ns5, d5). these

degenerate bound states have also been discussed, for example, in [3,5].

now some of the states above belong to type iib theory and so, we can apply s-duality

to those states to obtain new bound states. for example, from ((f, d3), (ns5, d3)) we can

have (((f, d1), d3), ((ns5, d5), d3)) as a new bound state. similarly from other states

also we can generate new bound states by s-duality of type iib theory. we can again apply

t-duality on these newly constructed bound states to obtain more bound states, then again

17

s-duality to those belonging to type iib theory. continuing this process we can obtain

all possible non-threshold bound states by s- and t-dualities simply from the original (f,

d1) strings. this process obviously will end after a nite number of steps and thus we

have nitely many bound states in both type iia and type iib theories8. although at this

stage we are unable to count the exact number of bound states, but since there are nitely

many we believe that they may be related to the number of generators of the largest nite

u-duality group of type ii theory i.e. e8(+8). we speculate as in [8] that these bound states

would form multiplets of e8(+8) u-duality symmetry in the yet unknown m- or u-theory.

we will come back to provide more evidence for this in the near future.

iv. conclusion

to summarize, by making use of sl(2, z) symmetry of type iib string theory we have

constructed in this paper a more general bound state of the type ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) from

the known (f, d5) conguration. there are innite number of (m, n) strings forming bound

state with (m, n) 5-branes. (m, n) and (m, n) are respectively the integers corresponding

to the charges associated with the nsns and rr gauge elds of the strings and 5-branes.

the integer pairs (m, n) and (m, n) are relatively prime. we have shown that a consistent

quantization of charges of the strings and 5-branes relates these integers as m = n and

n = m. thus the bound state ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)) is characterized by a pair of integers
(m, n) or (m, n). this seems to indicate that the existence of string bound states implies

the existence of 5-brane bound states. from the explicit space-time conguration of ((f,

d1), (ns5, d5)), we have shown how various bound states appear as special cases. thus we

obtain (f, d5) and (d1, ns5) bound states from here, but because of the charge relation

between strings and 5-branes we can not get (f, ns5) and (d1, d5) bound states. this

8even if we count possible bound states by applying t-dualities along the transverse directions

of d6 in ((f, d2), (kk, d6)).

18

result is consistent with the fact that (f, ns5) and (d1, d5) preserve 1/4 rather than 1/2

of the spacetime supersymmetries.

the descendants of this bound state could be obtained by applying t-dualities along

various transverse and longitudinal directions as well as s-duality of type iib theory. we

have given explicit space-time conguration of ((f, d2), (kk, d6)) in type iia theory by

applying t-duality in one of the transverse directions on ((f, d1), (ns5, d5)). how the

various bound states can be obtained as special cases are also indicated. then we have

given the list of all possible bound states which can be obtained from ((f, d1), (ns5, d5))

and ((f, d2), (kk, d6)) by t-dualities. as we have mentioned, this is not the end of the

story. we can form new bound states by applying s-duality to these t-dual bound states

belonging to type iib theory. t-duality can again be applied to these new set of bound

states to generate another new set. then s-duality on those in type iib theory will produce

even more bound states. thus continuing this process we can generate all possible bound

states, which will be nitely many, in both type iia and type iib theories. all these states

preserve one half of the space time supersymmetries. we conjecture that these bound states

would form multiplets of the largest nite u-duality group e8(+8) of yet unknown m- or

u-theory.
