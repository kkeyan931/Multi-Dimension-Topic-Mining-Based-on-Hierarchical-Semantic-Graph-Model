abstract

we study n = 4 supersymmetric quantum-mechanical many-body systems with
m bosonic and 4m fermionic degrees of freedom. we also investigate the further
restrictions of conformal and superconformal invariance. in particular, we construct
conformal n = 4 extensions of the am 1 calogero models, which for generic values
of the coupling constant are not su(1, 1|2) superconformal. this class of models
is also extended to arbitrary (even) n . we give both hamiltonian and (classical)
in the latter case we use both component and n = 4
lagrangean formulations.
supereld formulations.

1 introduction

recently there has been increased interest in supersymmetric quantum-mechanical mod-
els. contrary to the situation in higher dimensions, such models have been much less
studied. one recent application is to black hole physics [1, 2, 3, 4]. a related issue is
the still incompletely understood ads2/cft1 correspondence [5].
in the case of black
holes, most work has so far been concerned with n = 4 models with 4m bosonic and 4m
fermionic coordinates, and general results for such models have been obtained [6, 7, 8].
the emphasis has been on which (sigma-model) metrics are consistent with supersym-
metry and the properties of the resulting geometries. our focus is slightly dierent; we
discuss models with m bosonic and 4m fermionic degrees of freedom, take the metric
to be at and study the constraints on the potential coming from supersymmetry. we
also investigate the constraints arising from adding more symmetry such as translational
invariance, conformal invariance and superconformal invariance. we do not have any par-
ticular application in mind, although n = 4 supersymmetric superconformal calogero
models have been conjectured [1] to provide a microscopic description of four-dimensional
extremal reissner-nordstrom black holes. the calogero models [9] and their generali-
sations comprise a particular class of many-body quantum-mechanical models that have
been intensely studied over the years. these models have appeared in various areas of
theoretical physics, ranging from problems in condensed matter physics to seiberg-witten
theory. for reviews with extensive lists of references to the early literature, see [11] (for

reviews on the connection to seiberg-witten theory, see e.g. [10]). it is well known that
the calogero systems are intimately connected with the semi-simple lie algebras. for
every (semi-simple) lie algebra there is an associated calogero system. it is perhaps less
widely known that the conditions can be weakened. recently it has been shown [12, 13]
that one actually does not need a root system associated to a lie algebra to construct a
calogero model. it is sucient to have a root system associated to any nite reection
group (coxeter group); only when the root system is crystallographic can one associate it
to a lie algebra and the coxeter group is then called the weyl group. the calogero sys-
tems are integrable (see e.g. [14, 13] and references therein) and, for the cases with discrete
spectrum, exactly solvable. by exactly solvable we mean the condition that it should be
possible to obtain the eigenfunctions in an algebraic way. this has been shown using
various dierent approaches, see e.g. [15, 16, 17]. an interesting feature of the am 1
calogero models is that they are translational- and conformal-invariant. the two-particle
case coincides (after removing the centre-of-mass motion) with the model of conformal
mechanics studied in [18]. supersymmetric extensions of the calogero models with n = 2
supersymmetry have also been constructed [19, 20, 21, 22]. so far the supersymmetric
models have not had as many applications as the bosonic models. the models constructed
in [19] are also superconformal; the superconformal algebra being osp(2|2) = su(1, 1|1).
the relative motion of the two-particle case was studied before in [23]. in [24, 25, 26]
(see also [27]) an n = 4 superconformal extension of the conformal quantum mechanics
model was constructed (a related development is [28]). the superconformal group in this
case is su(1, 1|2). this result has not been extended to the many-body case.

in the next section we investigate (using the quantum hamiltonian formalism [29]) the
restrictions of n = 4 supersymmetry, conformal invariance and su(1, 1|2) superconformal
symmetry. we rst discuss the one-particle case and then move on to the many-body case
and derive general results. we concentrate on the am 1 calogero models, but our results
are applicable also to other cases. we show that it is possible to construct conformal
n = 4 extensions of the am 1 calogero models, which are su(1, 1|2) superconformal only
for a particular value of the coupling constant. furthermore, we show that (given certain
assumptions) for m > 2 and generic values of the coupling constant there are no natural
su(1, 1|2) superconformal extensions of the am 1 calogero models.
in section 3 we
present a similar discussion employing the language of the classical lagrangean formalism
[30]. we use both supereld and component formulations. we also briey discuss the
connection between the classical lagrangean approach and the quantum hamiltonian one.
we end with a short discussion of the possible relevance of our results to black hole physics
and some open questions.

2 quantum hamiltonian formulation

we assume the n = 4 supersymmetry algebra to be of the form

[qa, qb]+ = 2b

ah ,

[qa, qb]+ = 0 ,

[qa, qb]+ = 0 ,

(2.1)

where a, b = 1, 2. in other words, we use a complex formalism. some of our conclusions
may be altered if the supersymmetry algebra is changed, i.e. if central charges are allowed

2

or if more general supersymmetry algebras are considered (such as the ones in [31, 8]). in
this section we will investigate the restrictions on the potential resulting from requiring
an n = 4 symmetry in the form of the supersymmetry algebra (2.1). we will also discuss
the restrictions coming from demanding conformal and superconformal invariance.

2.1 preliminaries: one-body models

the supercharges are qa and their hermitean conjugates. we sometimes use the notation
q  q1 and q  q2 to reduce the number of indices. the discussion below of the
one-body case is in part a review (of [25, 26]), but it is presented in such a way as to
facilitate the extension to the many-particle case to be discussed later. we will denote the
bosonic coordinate by x and use the concrete realisation , ,  and  for the fermionic
coordinates. on general grounds the supercharges can be taken to be of the form:

q =  p  iw [0](x)  iw [1](x)



 ! ,

q =  p  iw [0](x)  iw [1](x)



! ,

(2.2)

together with their hermitean conjugates (using  = 
symmetry algebra (2.1) is satised if the following equation is satised (  d

 and () =  ). the super-

dx )

2w [0]  2w [0]w [1] + w [1]  w [1]w [1] = 0 .

the hamiltonian then becomes

(2.3)

(2.4)

we will now restrict ourselves to conformal models. such models satisfy [d, h] = ih,
where d =  1
4 [x, p]+ [18]. to regain the osp(2|2) superconformal mechanics of [23] when
restricting to the n = 2 sub-sector, we have to set w [0] = 
x . somewhat surprisingly, for
this choice of w [0] there are two solutions to the constraint (2.3) preserving conformal
invariance, namely: w [1] =  1
x . thus, there are two dierent conformal
n = 4 supersymmetrisations of conformal mechanics (or equivalently, of the relative
motion of the a1 calogero model). the corresponding hamiltonians are

(2.5)

although both models in (2.5) are conformal, only the rst has su(1, 1|2) as its super-
conformal algebra for generic . this can be seen by making a general ansatz for the
generators of special supersymmetries s, s and their hermitean conjugates. the su(1, 1|2)
superconformal algebra (see appendix) is satised if s = x, s = x and xw [1] = 1.
the other generators of su(1, 1|2) are then given by

j1 =  1

2 ( + ) ,

j2 =  i

2(  ) ,

j3 = 1

2(  ) .

(2.6)

furthermore, the central element t is given by t = xw [0]  1
2. thus, there is a unique
su(1, 1|2) conformally invariant model. for this model t =   1
2. the second model
above is su(1, 1|2) superconformal only when  = 1
2, in which case it coincides with a
special case of the rst model (with t = 0). for other values of  the conformal and
supersymmetry generators belong to some other superconformal algebra. the free theory
is not su(1, 1|2) superconformal. the above su(1, 1|2) superconformal model is, however,
on-shell-dual to a free n = 4 theory with a complex bosonic coordinate (2 real ones)
[24]. let us also mention that for the rst model above there is a simple extension to
arbitrary (even) n [26], i.e arbitrary number of supersymmetries (there is no restriction
on the number of supersymmetries in one dimension since there is no notion of spin). the
arbitrary-n models have the following supercharges [26]

(2.8)

for the second model in (2.5) a similar extension to arbitrary (even) n can be constructed
by taking the supercharges to be of the form

2.2 extension to many-body models

we will now discuss the extension of the above results to the many-body case. the
coordinates are xi, i, i, i and i
, where i = 1, . . . , m. here, and throughout the

4

paper, we will assume that the hamiltonians are invariant under permutations of the
coordinates. we take the supercharge q to be of the form

q = xj

j pj  iw [0]

j (xk)  ixnm

w [1]

jnm(xk)n



 m! ,

(2.12)

with a similar expression for q. this is not the most general choice, but it is a natural
extension of the supercharges used to construct n = 2 models [19, 32, 21, 22]. the
supersymmetry algebra (2.1) is satised if the following conditions are fullled

w [1]

ijk = ijkw [1] ,

m]jl = 0 ,

w [0]
i = iw [0] ,

one solution to the last constraint in (2.13) is the trivial one: w [0] = 0, i.e. w [0] =
 1
n = 2 models, e.g. the calogero models. we would like to stress that one also has to
check that the other conditions in (2.13) hold. with w [0] = 0, the supercharge q takes
the form

q = xj

j  pj

with a similar expression for q. the am 1 calogero models have w [0] =

w [1] =

(2.16)

it can readily be checked that all conditions in (2.13) are fullled. the resulting hamilto-
nian becomes

operator satisfying: ikij = kijj, ikij = kij
ij = 1 and kijkjk = kjkkji =
kkikij. the above models are closely related to the general models in [33] (see also [15])
and should hence be integrable. notice that kij only acts on the fermionic coordinates
whereas the operators in [33, 15] also act on the bosonic coordinates; it is however easy

the n = 4 models just constructed are conformal, but as we shall see next the
superconformal algebra is not su(1, 1|2). we now turn to the question of what restrictions

follow from demanding su(1, 1|2) superconformal invariance. with s = pi ixi and
s = pi

2 . the restriction (2.19) on w [1]

ijk, show that the models (2.17)

ijk =  1

ijk = jk + 1

another issue is translational invariance. the condition for superconformal invari-
ance (2.19) is not consistent with translational invariance of w [1] (since that would imply
ijk the non-translational-invariant

m x (where x = pi xi) the remaining relative part can

pk kw [1] = 0). however, after extracting from w [1]
pi xiw [1]

centre-of-mass part w [1]cm
be taken to be translational-invariant and the superconformal condition is replaced by
m . with this modication of the models in (2.17), they become
su(1, 1|2) superconformal for certain exotic values of the coupling constant , namely
when  = 1
m . we will now address the question of whether there exist su(1, 1|2)
superconformal extensions of the am 1 calogero models for generic values of the cou-
pling constant. if we assume that w [0] has an overall parameter (as in the case of the
calogero models) then (if demand conformal invariance and discard the above solution)
lij lw [0], and
lnn. notice that the latter equation is consistent with (2.19)

the last equation in (2.13) decouples into two equations: ijw [0] = pl w [1]
ipn w [1]

and conformal invariance. when w [0] has the calogero form w [0] = 
one can show that there are no solutions to the coupled set of equations (2.13),(2.19)
for m = 3; we believe that this continues to be true for higher m (it can be shown for
all m > 2 that for generic  there is no solution with two-body interaction forces only).
thus, we conclude that for m > 2 there is no natural candidate for an n = 4 su(1, 1|2)
superconformal am 1 calogero model which has the proper n = 2 limit. we would like to
stress that this conclusion depends on the particular (but natural) choice of supercharges
(2.12).

is it possible to nd other su(1, 1|2) superconformal models? for simplicity let us
discuss the m = 3 (three-particle) case in more detail. there is actually no solution
to the set of constraints given above for any w [0] with an overall parameter and two-
body interactions only, so the conditions have to be weakened. one has to allow for a
-independent part in w [0] and/or higher-body interactions if one is to be able to satisfy
the constraints. at least for the m = 3 case it turns out that it not sucient to introduce
higher-body interactions, so we will therefore allow for a -independent part in w [0]. at
this point we recall that there is another three-particle translational-invariant (bosonic)
calogero model (besides the a2 one) namely the model associated to the g2 lie algebra
[34]. the hamiltonian is

(2.21)

the two coupling constants 1 and 2 can be chosen independently. this hamiltonian has
all the nice properties of the calogero models, such as integrability and exact solvability
[35]. using reasoning similar to the one used in the a2 case one can show that there does
not exist any su(1, 1|2) superconformal n = 4 extension when the qas are of the form
(2.12) and the two coupling constants are unrelated. choosing the centre-of-mass part of
w [1]

one could continue this analysis to higher m and try to nd interesting solutions. one
restriction one could impose is that the bosonic part should have special properties, such
as e.g. integrability. perhaps it is possible to turn things around and use supersymmetry
considerations to construct interesting bosonic models.

3 classical lagrangean treatment

in this section we perform a study of n = 4 models similar to the one in section 2, but
from a (classical) lagrangean perspective.

3.1 one-body models

a + iat, da =  

in [24] (see also [27]) an su(1, 1|2) superconformal mechanics model was constructed.
the action is most succinctly written in n = 4 superspace. our superspace conventions
coincide with those of [24] and are as follows: da = 
 iat, and
{da, db} = 2ib
at. indices are raised and lowered with ab and its inverse ab (abbc =
c
a). to reduce the number of indices we will sometimes suppress contracted indices with
the understanding that the rst index should be in a natural position. the action given
in [24] was constructed in terms of a real supereld with components | = x, da| = ia,
da| = i a and [d(a, db)]| = fab, where | as usual is shorthand for |a=0,a=0. since
the representation corresponding to the real supereld  is not irreducible one has to
constrain the supereld. the following constraints were used in [24]: d2 =  1
 dd,
d2 =  1
 . these constraints are the

one-dimensional analogue of the constraints for the four-dimensional tensor multiplet [37].
the superspace action is

d d and [da, da]  [d, d] =  2

for completeness we now briey describe how to pass to the hamiltonian form and then to
 l, where p = l
quantum mechanics. the classical hamiltonian is hc = xp + p + p 
x ,
pa = l
 a are the conjugate momenta (fermionic variational derivatives
a
act from the left). the canonical poisson brackets are {p, x} = 1, {pb, a}+ = b
a,
and {p b, a}+ = a
b . using standard methods to deal with the second class constraints
a  0, lead to the dirac brackets {a, b} = ib
a = p a  i
a.
the noether charges associated to the supersymmetry invariance of the action are qa
and qa. at this point we deviate from the particular model discussed so far and assume
the supercharges to be of the more general form

2a  0 and a = pa  i

qa = a(p  iw[0](x))  iw[1](x)a( bb) ,

qa = a(p + iw[0](x)) + iw[1](x) a( bb) .
(3.3)
ahc to be satised, the following condition has to be fullled:

in order for {qa, qb} = 2ib
w[0] = w[0]w[1], and hc is then determined to be

hc = 1

2p2 + 1

2(w[0])2 + w[0] cc + 1

2w[1]( cc)2 .

x, w[1] =  1

x and w[0] = 0, w[1] =  2

a, the fermions can be realised as a = a and a =  

in the conformal case both w[0] and w[1] are proportional to 1
x and the equation w[0] =
w[0]w[1] has two solutions corresponding to the two solutions found in the quantum case:
w[0] = 
x , where  is a constant. the next step
is to pass to the quantum theory using the usual rule {, }  i[, ]. since [a, b]+ =
b
. one has to deal with
ordering ambiguities in the supercharges (such ambiguities are absent for n = 2 systems).
requiring that the supercharges still come in hermitean-conjugate pairs after quantisation
(which guarantees that the hamiltonian is hermitean) and that the supersymmetry algebra
is still satised i.e. [qa, qb]+ = 2b
ah, xes the ordering ambiguities. we then regain the
supercharges and hamiltonian given earlier in (2.2) and (2.4).

supercharges (3.3)? for instance, for the other conformal model, the superspace action is

although the potential has no bosonic part, the quantum potential has such a part,
which, as we have seen, arises from ordering ambiguities. the actions for the models
with supercharges (3.3) can also be written in superspace; the general construction will
be given in the next subsection.

3.2 many-body models

the above results will now be extended to many-body systems. in this section we use the
einstein summation convention: repeated indices are summed. the construction involves
two functions, w[0]
ijk(xl), which are assumed to satisfy the following constraints:

i (xl) and w[1]

ijk = ijkw[1] ,

w[0]
i = iw[0] , w[1]
w[1]

the following action

(3.8)
is supersymmetric (see below) if the constraints (3.7) hold. the associated supersymmetry
noether charges are

qa = i

a(pi  iiw[0]  i bnm

b w[1]

qa = a(pi + iiw[0] + i bnm

b w[1]

(3.9)

and satisfy {qa, qb}

ahc, where hc is the classical hamiltonian associated to the

the conformal am 1 n = 4 calogero models corresponding to the ones constructed
in the quantum case (cf. (2.17)) have w[0] = 0, which means that classically they have
no bosonic potential, however, after passing to quantum mechanics a bosonic potential is
generated as a result of ordering ambiguities.

the models (3.8) can also be written in superspace. to this end we introduce m real
i and [d(a, db)]i| =
ab, while the other components have to be constrained. we introduce the following

superelds i with components i| = xi, dai| = ii
f i
constraints:

a, dbi| = i b

ijk(l)djdk ,

d2i = w[1]

ijk(l) dj dk ,

d2i = w[1]
[d, d]i = 2w[1]

ijk(l)dj dk  4w[0]

i (l) .

(3.10)

in this context the constraints (3.7) can be viewed as consistency conditions for the
superspace constraints (3.10). we take the superspace action to be of the form

s =

1

8 z dtdada db dba(i) ,

where the scalar functional a is assumed to satisfy the equation

ija + w[1]

ijkka = ij .

(3.11)

(3.12)

the rationale for this choice is that it implies d2a =  di di. the component action
can then easily be obtained using the constraints (3.7), (3.10), with the result (3.8). the
superspace equation of motion is

[d(a, db)]i = 2w[1]

ijkd(aj db)k ,

(3.13)

10

and it can be shown that it reproduces the component equations of motion derived from
(3.8), after the auxiliary elds f i

ab are eliminated.

the requirement (in addition to conformal invariance) for su(1, 1|2) superconformal
invariance is xlw[1]
lij = ij. the question arises if/how a is related to w[1] and w[0]. one
possibility is that a = w[1]. this choice is consistent with the condition for su(1, 1|2)
superconformal invariance (and in fact implies it if the matrix mij = ijw[1] + ij is
invertible and the theory is conformal). of the many-body models constructed before
in section 2, only the classical four-body model corresponding to (2.25) satises this
constraint.

from the lagrangean read o from (3.8) or from the dirac bracket of the noether
charges (3.9), one can obtain the classical hamiltonian and then pass to quantum me-
chanics to regain the results obtained in the previous section. the seeming dierence
between the classical quantities and the quantum ones result from ordering ambiguities.

4 discussion

although we only constructed n  4 extensions of the am 1 calogero models, it should
also be possible to extend the results to the calogero models based on the other root
systems. another question is whether it is possible to extend the results to the super-
sutherland models [32, 21, 22]. a more uniform formulation along the lines of the one
in [22] would also be desirable. in particular, the integrability properties merit further
investigation. the results on exact solvability [15, 16, 21, 17] are expected to hold also
for the supersymmetric extensions (of the models with discrete spectrum).

another issue worth studying is supersymmetry breaking (extending the results in
[38]). one could also investigate more general models, e.g. by introducing a non-trivial
metric so that h = 1
it may be interesting to try and lift the more
general superspace constraints (3.10) for i to four dimensions, which might lead to a
generalisation of the result in [37] to many elds.

it was conjectured by gibbons and townsend [1] that an n = 4 su(1, 1|2) supercon-
formal extension of the am 1 calogero models could provide a microscopic description
of an extremal d = 4 reissner-nordstrom black hole. this conjecture was partly based
on the observation [39, 27] that the radial motion of a super-particle in the near-horizon
limit of a large-mass extremal d = 4 reissner-nordstrom black hole is described by the
su(1, 1|2) superconformal mechanics model of [24]. a related issue is the quantum me-
chanics of m slowly moving extremal black holes in four dimensions. this multi-black
hole mechanics should be described in terms of 3m bosonic and 4m fermionic degrees of
freedom (just as the multi-black holes in ve dimensions discussed in [3] are described in
terms of 4m bosonic and 4m fermionic coordinates). thus, it would seem that models
with m bosonic and 4m fermionic coordinates are perhaps more naturally connected with
two-dimensional black holes. however, the near-horizon geometry of an extremal d = 4
reissner-nordstrom black hole is ads2  s2 and there is a natural angular/radial split.
hence, it is not excluded that models with m bosonic and 4m fermionic coordinates
may provide a microscopic description of d = 4 black holes (this is in the spirit of the
ads/cft correspondence). such a many-body model is expected to have an su(1, 1|2)

11

superconformal symmetry. for generic values of the coupling constant, we have not been
able to construct an n = 4 extension of the am 1 calogero models with an su(1, 1|2)
symmetry. the only possible way around this result is to change the supercharges. an-
other possibility is that another generalisation of the one-body case is needed, however,
without further input it is not clear which assumptions should be made to pinpoint such
a model. one criterion one could use [1] is that when all coordinates but one are small,
then the model should reduce to the one-body su(1, 1|2) model. even if it turns that
there is no direct connection between the models considered in this paper and black hole
physics, they may still be valuable as toy models.
