abstract

we study the su(3)-invariant relevant deformation of d = 4 n = 4 su(n) gauge theory
at large n using the ads/cft correspondence. at low energies, we obtain a nonsuper-
symmetric gauge theory with three left-handed quarks in the adjoint of su(n). in terms
of the ve dimensional gauged supergravity, there is an unstable critical point in the scalar
potential for uctuations of some elds in a nontrivial representation of the symmetry group
su(3). on the eld theory side, this corresponds to dynamical breaking of the su(3) chiral
symmetry down to so(3). we compute the condensate of the quark bilinear and the two-
point correlation function of the spontaneously broken currents from supergravity and nd
a nonzero pion decay constant, f.

introduction

consider su(n) yang-mills elds, coupled to nf weyl fermions, i (i = 1, ..., nf ), in
the adjoint of the gauge group su(n), often referred to as adjoint qcd. for nf  5,
the theory is asymptotically free and very plausibly connes for energies smaller than the
dynamically generated scale. the global symmetry group is su(nf ). the weyl fermions
are in the fundamental representation, which is complex for nf > 2. this chiral symmetry
is presumably dynamically broken down to so(nf ), its largest vector-like subgroup1 [1,2].
the order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking is the expectation value of the quark
bilinear

htriji  ij

(1.1)
in the infrared, the physical degrees of freedom are nf (nf + 1)/2 1 massless goldstone
bosons, whose dynamics is described by an eective chiral lagrangian  a nonlinear -model,
whose target space is su(nf )/so(nf ). at least for small goldstone boson elds, we can
parametrize the coset as

i, j = 1, ..., nf

.

where the sa are real, traceless, symmetric matrices, satisfying tr(sasb) = 2ab. the most
relevant term in the action contains two derivatives and may be written as

u(x) = eia(x)sa/f

(1.3)

one can easily check that it is invariant under global right-su(nf ) and local left-so(nf )
transformations

u(x)  h(x)u(x)g1,

g  su(nf ),

h(x)  so(nf )

.

(1.4)

the dimensionful constant f is related to the strength of the chiral fermion condensate
(1.1).

there is a one-loop chiral anomaly associated to the su(nf ) symmetry group, whose
manifestation at low energies is encoded by the wess-zumino action2. using some extension
of u(x) to the 5-ball, the wz action is
i(n 2  1)

and is the leading term odd in the number of goldstone boson elds. the normalization is
twice what we naively expect for u(x)  su(nf ) 3. it is invariant under global right-su(nf )
1actually, the chiral symmetry group is (su (nf )  z2ncnf )/znf , broken to o(nf ); but, since we are
not worried about things like domain walls, it suces to consider a connected component of the vacuum
manifold.

2here and below, we work in euclidean signature.
3the quantization of the wz action is slightly subtle here. as we will mainly be interested in nf = 3, let
us specialize to that case (similar results hold for nf = 4, 5). the result (1.5) is twice what we would get by
normalizing it to the integral generator of h5(su (3)). consider the ber bundle su (3)  su (3)/so(3),
with ber so(3). we claim that if y is the generator of h5(su (3)/so(3), z), then y is twice the generator
of h5(su (3), z). we relegate the details to appendix b.

and topologically-trivial local left-so(nf ) transformations. however 4(so(nf ) 6= 0. the
wess-zumino action shifts by 2i under homotopically-nontrivial so(nf ) transformations.
were it not for the extra factor of 2 in (1.5), esw z [u ] would change sign under so(nf )
transformations which are nontrivial elements of 4.

we are interested in correlation functions of the su(nf ) conserved currents, j. at low
momenta (or widely separated points), these may be computed from the goldstone boson
eective lagrangian. the simplest way to study such correlators is to add sources a for the
currents j to the two-derivative action (1.3),

s2[u, a] = 

f 2


4 z d4x tr(cid:16) 1

2(cid:0)u( + a)u1 + (u( + a)u1)t(cid:1)(cid:17)2

(1.6)

in a way that now (1.6) is invariant under local su(nf ) transformations, given by (1.4) and

a  gag1 + gdg1

.

similarly, one can gauge the wess-zumino term, sw z[u, a], such that its variation under
local su(nf ) transformations reproduces the chiral anomalies of the underlying fermion
theory (for a discussion of the general case of g/h, see [3]).

by dierentiating with respect to a and setting a = 0, we obtain the correlation functions

of the currents. in momentum space, the two point function is

(p1)j b
hj a

(p2)i =

ab pp
f 2

p2 (2)4(4)(p1 + p2)

the three point function contains the anomaly

where dabc = 1
currents at low momenta, we can determine f.

2t r(sa{sb, sc}). so by studying the two- and three-point functions of the
for nf = 3, this theory can be embedded in n = 4 sym as follows. starting with the

n = 4 theory, we add a mass term for one of the gluinos,
l = tr(m44 + m44)

.

(1.9)

this breaks all the supersymmetries and breaks su(4)r to su(3).
integrating out the
massive fermion at one loop (exact, since the fermions appear only quadratically in the
action), we obtain a common mass-squared for all six scalars in the n = 4 vector multiplet.
to see this, it is convenient to write the 6 as the antisymmetric product of two 4s. a
convenient basis, ab (a, b = 1, ...4), for the scalars is (i = 1, 2, 3)

the yukawa couplings are

i4 = i + ii+3
2ijkjk = i  ii+3

the one-loop diagram with two insertions of the fermion mass matrix, mab, induces a scalar
mass term proportional to

 acde(mm)c

babde

which, for m44 = m and otherwise zero, is just a common mass for all six scalars.

thus, at low energies, we obtain a non-supersymmetric su(n) gauge theory with three
massless adjoint fermions and no scalars  in other words, adjoint qcd for nf = 3. we use
the n = 4 theory as a particular ultraviolet regularization of this nf = 3 theory. for large
n, we can try to exploit the ads/cft correspondence to study it.
in [4,5], it was observed that there is a supergravity solution which interpolates be-
tween the maximally supersymmetric su(4)-invariant critical point of the 5d supergravity
potential, located at the origin of the scalar eld space, and the non-supersymmetric su(3)-
invariant critical point located at some point  =  6= 0 on the su(3) invariant direction,
parametrized by , of the scalar eld space. both critical points have negative cosmological
constant and correspond to anti-de sitter spaces [6].

in light of the ads/cft correspondence [7,8,9], the conformal eld associated to the
supergravity eld  is the fermion mass term (1.9) and references [4,5] interpreted the in-
terpolating supergravity solution from  = 0 to  = 0 as the renormalization group ow of
the n = 4 su(n) gauge theory, at large n and strong t hooft coupling, perturbed by the
relevant perturbation (1.9).
if we believe in this supergravity solution, we would be led to expect that the boundary
eld theory ows from the n = 4 superconformal xed point in the uv to a nonsuper-
symmetric conformal xed point in the ir. this is in sharp contrast to the eld theory
expectations outlined above. admittedly, the supergravity description is valid at large n
and strong t hooft coupling, where our grasp of the eld theory is less secure. but still, a
nontrivial infrared xed point for this theory would be a surprise.

anti-de sitter spacetimes with scalar elds have to satisfy a particular lower bound for
the masses of such scalars, the breitenlohner-freedman bound [10] (see also [11]), in order to
have an (at least perturbatively) stable gravitational background under scalar uctuations.
hence, in [4] we stressed the importance of performing an explicit check of the breitenlohner-
freedman bound in non-supersymmetric gravitational backgrounds4. among the models we
discussed in [4] was an su(3)-invariant ve dimensional anti-de sitter background, which
we found to be stable.

we now believe that calculation was in error, and the su(3) critical point is unstable5. in
the ve dimensional n = 8 supergravity multiplet there are ten complex scalars in the irrep
10 of su(4). decomposing this representation under its su(3) subgroup, 10 = 1 + 3 + 6,

4if the background preserves some supersymmetries, the breitenlohner-freedman bound is guaranteed.
5we would like to thank freedman, gubser, pilch and warner for pointing out to us that the stability
analysis of the su (3) point in [4] was probably incorrect. we are especially grateful to krzysztof pilch for
a lengthy series of email exchanges in which we reconciled our respective calculations.

3

we obtain the singlet, , a triplet which is higgsed for  6= 0 and six physical complex scalars
in the symmetric tensor,
, of su(3). upon correcting our previous calculation, it turns
out that the scalars in the 6 are unstable modes, which violate the breitenlohner-freedman
bound6. the tiniest uctuations drive us away from the would-be su(3) critical point.

what does this mean for the eld theory? if the su(3) critical point is unstable, the
renormalization group ow of the su(3) invariant theory certainly does not end up at any
non-trivial infra-red xed point. but then, where does it ow to? to elucidate this question,
rst we should identify the conformal elds in the boundary theory which are associated to
the 6. they are the fermion bilinears

oij = trij

.

from our previous discussion of chiral symmetry breaking in adjoint qcd, the most plausible
interpretation is that, even though we do not couple oij to a source at the boundary  as
we do for the conformal eld which couples to   the renormalization group ow, read on
the supergravity eld space, is driven in a particular direction where some unstable modes
in the 6 are turned on. that is, whereas the su(4) symmetry is broken explicitly, the su(3)
symmetry is broken dynamically by an expectation value for the operator oij.
the purpose of this paper is to examine these phenomena from the point of view of
the ve dimensional supergravity and, in particular, to elucidate the fate of the unstable
su(3) critical point. one of the main goals is to search for goldstone boson eects from
the supergravity side. we will compute the pion decay constant f in this model of adjoint
qcd from the two point correlation function of the spontaneously broken currents j .

2. the supergravity background

under the so(3) subgroup of su(3) that leaves invariant the condensate (1.1), irreps of
su(3) have the following branching rules:

3 = 3
6 = 5 + 1
8 = 5 + 3 .

(2.1)

the supergravity eld corresponding to the chiral condensate (1.1) is the so(3) singlet in
the 6 of su(3). we parametrize this complex scalar as ei. besides this eld, there are two
additional complex scalars which are singlets of so(3) in the 5d supergravity multiplet with
nonzero boundary conditions. there is the su(4)-invariant dilaton and axion, parametrized
by the complex scalar ei, and the su(3)-invariant complex eld ei, whose source term
is the nonzero gluino mass m 7.

6in appendix a we write the scalar spectrum at the su (3) critical point
7there is another so(3) singlet in the 6 inside the 20 of su (4). but only the 6 in the 10 are unstable
at the su (3) critical point. hence, in order to simplify our discussion, we will put that additional so(3)
singlet to zero.

2.1. supergravity lagrangian and equations of motion

the next thing we need is the exact dependence of the n = 8 ve-dimensional supergrav-
ity lagrangian on these so(3)-singlet scalars. details of its parametrization and of the
computation are contained in appendix a 8. here we just present the result:

if 2 + 3 +  = 0, one can truncate the theory to the space of solutions with constant
phases , ,  = 0. this is not an accident. the eective cp-violating theta angle of the
boundary theory turns out to be proportional to the combination of angles 2 + 3 + . if
it is non zero, the strong cp-violating phase starts to run under the renormalization group
ow, with the ow triggered by the supergravity equations of motion.
in order to focus
on the mechanism of chiral symmetry breaking from supergravity in the simplest possible
context, we will work in the sector of vanishing theta angle. in this sector, the equations
of motion involve only the magnitudes , , . observe that the kinetic term of  is not
canonical. for vanishing phases, it has the scalar-dependent coecient

let us now write the supergravity equations of motion derived from (2.2). we parametrize

the ve-dimensional metric9 by the poincare-invariant ansatz

ds2 = e2y(z)(cid:0)dz2 + dx2(cid:1)

.

(2.5)

8when this paper was being written, the preprint [12] appeared, where the supergravity lagrangian for
the elds  and  (but not the dilaton or the phases) is also computed. interestingly, they look for bps
solutions in supergravity where the role of the boundary conditions for  and  are interchanged with respect
to ours. this simple switch gives completely dierent physics for the boundary eld theory.

9well always work in the einstein frame, and in euclidean signature.

this coupled system of nonlinear second order dierential equations, plus the boundary
conditions written below, codify the renormalization group ow of the n = 4 su(n) theory

2.2. ultraviolet behavior

observe the appearance of the mass scales ,  and . they arise because, for a
given scalar with mass m 2 in anti-de sitter space, there are two possible roots for the scaling
dimension of the boundary conformal eld to which it couples,

for the n = 4 xed point, the appropriate branch is +. as we will see, the scales ,
related with the  root, are linked to the condensates of the corresponding bare operators
[13,14].

2.3.

infrared behavior

since the supergravity potential (2.3) does not have critical points when  6= 0, the equations
of motion (2.6) drive the elds  and  to innity. this divergence usually produces a naked
singularity, located at z = z0, where the metric factor e2y vanishes10. this indicates that
the eld theory ows to a free phase in the infrared.

in the ultraviolet, our solution (2.8) had three undetermined dimensionless parameters,
,,/m. the appearance of such undetermined parameters in the asymptotic solution near
the boundary (z = 0) is typical; their values are determined by the behavior of the solution
in the infrared.

that is what happens here. in principle, we could integrate our solution (2.10) numer-
ically in the region [0, z0] and thereby determine the coecients in (2.8). the remaining
dimensionful parameter, m, corresponds to the location, z0, of the singularity, which is de-
termined by the integral of (2.6d).

we do not expect any further parameters, beyond n, g2

y m n and m, describing the
eld theory. so it is comforting that the complete supergravity solution does not have any.
however, since we will not perform the numerical integration of the supergravity equations,
our predictions for the eld theory behaviour will not be as powerful as they could be.

since the supergravity potential is independent of the ve-dimensional dilaton , the di-
mensionful scale  enters as an integration constant. the infrared solution (2.10) determines
its value to be

 =

.

(2.11)

we cannot, in similar fashion, give the actual values of  and  without the explicit
connection between the ir and the uv solution. but the fact that the ir solution has  6= 0
necessarily implies that  6= 0. we suspect that  = 0.
10references where naked singularities also appear in the study of supergravity duals are [15,16,17,18,19].

2.4. the ten dimensional geometry

in [20], a conjecture for the full ten dimensional metric was given. if we parametrize the
compact ve dimensional internal metric by {} ( = 1, ..., 5), the full metric is

ds2

10 =  2

3 ds2

5 + gdd

where g is the ve dimensional internal metric. it is obtained from

3 g = ck

(2.12)

(2.13)

where  =pdetg g0

ji are the 15
killing vectors on the s5; g1 is the inverse matrix of the sp(4) invariant matrix dened in
(4.14); and c is a normalization constant.

, with g0, the metric on the round s5; k 

ij = k 

we have computed the ten-dimensional metric in the so(3)-invariant background (2.10).
the result is complicated, and fairly unenlightening. what we do nd, however, is that the
full type iib geometry is singular at z = z0.

3. condensates and goldstone bosons

3.1. condensates

as was already observed in [13,14], the dimensionful scales appearing in (2.8) are related to
the condensates of the corresponding eld theory operators. let us rst show this for the
scale, , associated to the dilaton. take the dilaton term in the on-shell supergravity action
and vary it with respect to the value of the background dilaton at z = , 11

(3.8)

in the previous section, we observed that, due to the fact that the infrared solution has
 6= 0, the ultraviolet solution must have  6= 0. so the chiral symmetry, su(3), really is
broken down to so(3).
note that both condensates have the expected eld theory factor of n 2, as the elds are in
the adjoint representation of the gauge group. perhaps surprisingly, the glueball condensate
(3.4) does not have any explicit m-dependence. so long as m 6= 0, its value is xed by (2.11).
on the other hand, we expect that  is of order m.

3.2. goldstone bosons

the boundary theory has a spontaneously broken global symmetry, so we expect to see
goldstone bosons. the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the global symmetry su(3) to
so(3) produces 5 goldstone bosons, which couple to the broken currents, as reviewed in 1.
let us see how their eects arise from the point of view of supergravity.
in the ads/cft correspondence, the su(4)r currents couple to gauge elds of the bulk
supergravity theory.
if the gauge symmetry is unbroken, then the two-point function of
the currents falls o as 1/|x|6. for the broken currents, however, we will nd a slower
fallo, 1/|x|4, as the distance, |x|, between the two insertions goes to innity. this is the
position-space version of (1.7),

our goal will be to extract the pion decay constant, f. before we can do that, however, we
need to normalize the currents correctly. to do this, we will choose them to be normalized
so as to reproduce the anomaly (1.8). happily, this computation has already been done (in
the su(4)-invariant ads theory) in [21]. the anomaly is reproduced by the chern-simons
term of the ve-dimensional gauged supergravity action. it is unaected by the perturbation
we are doing.

returning to the two-point function, we need the quadratic part of the action evaluated
in the so(3)-invariant background. for the gauge elds not in the unbroken so(3) group,
there is a mass term in the action generated by the nonzero prole of the elds  and . in
the unitary gauge corresponding to the background solution (2.8) and (2.10), the quadratic
action for those gauge elds is

where e2 = 4/l2 is the ve dimensional su(4) gauge coupling, fij = iaj  jai (i, j =
1, . . . , 5; x5  z). the mass matrix m2
ab decomposes in two blocks. one, corresponding to
the gauge elds not in the su(3) subgroup, depends on both  and , and the other, for
the breaking of su(3) to so(3), depends only on the eld . in terms of the supergravity
theory, both have the same eect: they higgs some gauge symmetries. but, as we will see
below, those mass terms involving  behave dierently near the boundary and do not give
rise to goldstone bosons.

let us focus on the gauge elds that point in the directions of the coset space su(3)/so(3).
it is easy to see that their mass matrix is proportional to the identity; hence we will not
write the lie algebra indices explicitly. we have to nd the boundary-to-bulk propagator,

ai(x, z) =z d4y ki(x  y, z)a(y)

(3.11)

with a the source of the four dimensional global current j . the kernel ki(x, z) has to
satisfy the equations of motion coming from the action (3.10) and the boundary conditions

k(x, z) =  4(x)

kz(x, z) = 0

.

lim
z0
lim

(3.12)

we dont know the exact expression for the kernel ki(x, z) in our particular curved
background because we only have a perturbative solution (2.8) to the supergravity equations.
but we are only interested in the soft pion limit (3.9), and so the perturbative solution
suces, as all we need is an expansion of ki in powers of mz.

let us now analyze the rst order perturbation in m. to do so, we will assume that

finally, we turn to the currents which couple to the explicitly-broken generators in
su(4)/su(3). in this case, the gauge boson mass term depends of , giving m2  2 
(mz)2 near the boundary. the mass term enters into the analysis of the perturbed equations
of motion, and one nds that the two-point function of these currents decays exponentially
with distance.

15 in our peculiar gauge choice, there is such a pole in the zeroth order kernel (3.14), but the singular term
is not pure-gauge in the ve-dimensional sense, though

is pure-gauge in the ve-dimensional sense. k (1)

3.3. wilson loops

let us now discuss connement in this theory. the eective ve-dimensional n = 8 su(4)
gauged supergravity contains twelve two-forms bi (i = 1, ..., 6,  = 1, 2) transforming as
a (6, 2) of su(4)  sl(2, r). they couple, in an sl(2, z)-invariant fashion, to the (p, q)
type iib strings moving into the ve dimensional space-time. the strength of this coupling
is given by eective string tensions, t (p,q)
, which in general are background dependent [18].
the values of these tensions are given by the square root of the eigenvalues corresponding
to the (6, 2)-block of the sp(4) invariant metric

e

that appears in the kinetic term of the two-forms

gi,j = vi

abvjab

bi  dbi + gi,jbi  bj

(3.20)

(3.21)

.

the eigenvalues of gi,j are functions of  and ; we give their values in the appendix
a. at the origin of the eld space {, }, the eigenvalues are six copies of {e2, e2}, cor-
responding to the fundamental and d1 strings, respectively. but when ,  6= 0, they are
grouped in so(3) triplets. from the point of view of the modied wilson loops of malda-
cena, this is to be expected. their denition includes a term with the adjoint scalars x i
pointing in a particular direction of s5. the six dimensional vector representation of so(6)
decomposes into 3 + 3 under our so(3) embedding.

the static potential between a (p, q)-type dyon and its anti-dyon, is given by the world-
sheet that minimizes the action of the (p, q) string in our background. for a separation r,
we have

typically determines whether these dyons are conned.
if it goes to zero, generically the
charge is screened (a higgs phase) if, however, if it goes to zero with a very particular
power, we have a coulomb phase [15,18]. by contrast, if the positive quantity (3.23) does
not go to zero, we typically have connement. if it diverges in the infrared, with the absolute
minimum at some point z = zmin, then for large enough dyon-antidyon separation the (p, q)
string is able to reach z = zmin. the most energetically favorable situation is to remain
there, giving a linear conning potential.

things are more delicate when the minimum of (3.23) is at z = z0. for large separation,
the string connecting the dyons penetrates all the way to the singularity, where stringy
corrections are important. this is what happens in our case. when y  , the two triplets
of tensions go like16

16remember that the dilaton becomes irrelevant in this region.

12

for the so(3)-invariant supergravity background we have found, the factor (3.23) goes to
zero as z  z0 . hence, in order to conclude anything about the behaviour of the wilson
loops, we need to understand the physics in the neighbourhood of the singularity.

4. conclusions

we have studied chiral symmetry breaking in the context of the ads/cft correspondence.
we made a relevant deformation of the n = 4 su(n) yang mills theory by the addition
of a mass term for one of the fermions. we found a unique solution for the deformed
supergravity equations of motion, which corresponds to a nonzero condensate of a quark
bilinear in a singlet representation of the so(3) subgroup of su(3). we also computed the
pion decay constant f of the goldstone bosons from supergravity.

ideally, one would like to take m  , and thereby study the pure adjoint qcd
theory with nf = 3. this is possible, in principle, for small t hooft coupling. in that case,
the scale at which the adjoint qcd theory becomes strong is far below the scale m, at which
su(4) is broken to su(3). the supergravity, however, is valid for large t hooft coupling
and, in this case, the chiral symmetry breaking scale is not all that dierent from the scale at
which su(4) is explicitly broken. to really probe the adjoint qcd theory (which is dened
to be weakly-coupled at the cuto scale m), we would need to study the full type iib string
theory in this background. alas, that is beyond the scope of the present work.

appendix a: computation of the supergravity lagrangian

the construction of the d = 5, n = 8 su(4) gauged supergravity lagrangian is explained
in [6], and recently reviewed in [4,22].
we are particularly interested in the scalar sector, which involves 42 scalars parametrizing
the right coset space sp(4) \ e6(6). a point in this space is described by a 27  27 matrix
v ab
ab. this 27-bein is in the 27 of e6 (acting on the e6 indices a, b = 1, . . . , 8 from the
right) and 27 of sp(4) (acting on the sp(4) indices a, b = 1, . . . , 8 from the left). it maps
the 27 of e6(6) to the 27 of sp(4).

to parametrize the scalar manifold, it is sometimes more convenient to work in a dierent
basis for the 27 of e6(6). in the original reference [6], the scalars were parametrized in an
sl(6, r)  sl(2, r) real basis {zij, z i} (i, j = 1, . . . , 6 and  = 7, 8 are sl(6, r) and
sl(2, r) indices, respectively) for the 27 of e6(6), which decomposes into (15, 1)  (6, 2).
this is useful because the gauged so(6) embeds easily as a subgroup of sl(6, r).
in this basis, if we denote a generic element of the coset space sp(4) \ e6(6) by a real
matrix u = exp(), the change of basis that relates u to the 27-bein (which is linked to
basis of the local sp(4) symmetries) is performed by 8  8 hermitian and pure imaginary

13

matrices i that satisfy the so(6) cliord algebra17, and

6

yi=1
the sign is determined by the particular complex structure chosen on the space on which
sl(6, r)  sl(2, r) acts. the relation between v ab

to study the supergravity theory deformed by su(3)-invariant boundary conditions, it
proves convenient to construct the scalar manifold in an su(3)-adapted basis. the construc-
tion was explained in [4], and we follow it here, except for a small re-ordering of the su(3)
irreps comprising the 27 of e6(6)

to obtain the expressions of the 27-beins v ab

ab, we need the change of basis matrix that

where ab is the sp(4) symplectic metric. since there is no quadratic invariant for e6(6), this

the vector and antisymmetric elds (except for the topological chern-simons terms). see
[6] for the expressions of these terms.

to compute the wilson loops from the ve-dimensional supergravity theory, we will need
the eigenvalues of the (6, 2)-block gi,j. in the so(3)-invariant background they split in

appendix b: the cohomology of su (3)/so(3)

the wess-zumino lagrangian is normalized to be the generator of h5(su(3)/so(3), z). we
would like to write this in terms of its pullback to su(3). to do that, we use the leray

spectral sequence (see [24], p. 169) for the ber bundle su(3)  su(3)/so(3) 20.

the cohomology ring of su(3) is torsion-free, with generators in dimensions 3 and 5.

that is,

20we would like to thank dan freed for helping us through this computation.

can be computed from the universal coecients theorem ([24], p. 194),

where

ext(zm, z) = zm
ext(zm, zn) = zgcd(m,n)

for the e2 term, we see that d2(xb) = ay and d2(x) = c. now, both xb and ay are of order
2. so, when we take the cohomology, they both get killed. however, x has innite order,
while 2c = 0. so d2(2x) = 0, and hence 2x survives in the cohomology.

finally, we have

= gr(hn(su(3)))

.

that is, hn(su(3)) has a ltration

hn(su(3)) = f0  f1  f2  f3  . . .
such that fi/fi+1 = ei,ni
. the nontrivial case here is h5(su(3)) = z. we have f2/f3 = z2
and f5/f6 = z. this means that fi = 0 for i  6 and fi = z for i = 0, . . . 5. the inclusions
fi  fi1 for i < 6 are all isomorphisms, except for the map f3  f2, which is multiplication
by two. the net eect is that the map



 : h5(su(3)/so(3), z)  h5(su(3), z)

is multiplication by two.

this factor of two resolves an apparent puzzle [25]. since 4(so(3)) = z2, there is
an ambiguity in lifting the -model map into su(3)/so(3) to a map into su(3). let
w be the generator of 4(so(3)). then both u(x) and u(x) = w(x)u(x) represent the
same sigma model map into the coset space su(3)/so(3).
in particular, we must have
esw z [ u] = esw z [u ]. with the naive normalization of sw z coming from the generator of
h5(su(3), z), we would instead nd

esw z [w] = 1

.

(4.17)

but, from the previous analysis, we nd that the correct normalization of sw z, coming from
the generator of h5(su(3)/so(3), z), is twice the naive normalization, and thus esw z [w] =
1, as required.

similar computations can be carried out in the case of four avours, where 4(so(4)) =
z2 + z2 and ve avours, where 4(so(5)) = z2. indeed, the sign in (4.17) is intimately
related to the global anomaly [26] in gauging h. so long as the underlying fermion theory
is anomaly-free, the normalization of sw z must be such as to eliminate this sign.
