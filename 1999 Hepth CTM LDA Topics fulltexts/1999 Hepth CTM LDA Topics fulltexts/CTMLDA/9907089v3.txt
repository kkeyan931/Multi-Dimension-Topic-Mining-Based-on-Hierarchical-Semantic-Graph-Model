we show that the chiral gross-neveu model for a small number n of fermions has two characteris-
tic temperatures: tc that corresponds to onset of long-range or quasi-long-range order and t (> tc)
that corresponds to thermal breaking of fermion pairs. we show that the region tc < t < t  is
characterised by a complex gap function |(x)|ei(x) with nonzero gap modulus || but random
phase (x) so there is no phase coherence (or no quasi-long-range order in the case of a purely 2d
system) and system behaves like a gas of non-condensed composite bosons.

the gross-neveu (gn) model [1] is a eld theoretic
model of zero-mass fermions with quartic interaction,
which provide us with considerable insight into the mech-
anisms of spontaneous symmetry breakdown. this model
was intensively studied at nite temperatures in the limit
of large n, however its low-n behavior is a long-time un-
resolved question being an essentially more complicated
problem. the purpose of this paper is to consider, in
analogy to strong-coupling or low carrier density super-
conductor, the low-n behavior of the chiral gn model in
which fermions form bound states similar to the cooper
pairs. at low temperatures in dimensions higher than
two these pairs are condensed, and symmetry is bro-
ken. in exactly two dimensions there is no strict long-
range order however except for high-temperature disor-
dered phase there is kosterlitz-thouless transition to a
phase with quasi-long range order [2].

according to a mean-eld scenario, condensation or
quasicondensation of fermion pairs happens at the same
temperature as their formation. however we show that
at low n this scenario is qualitatively wrong and phase
diagram of the chiral gn model should contain a pseu-
dogap phase which is a large region where there exists a
nonzero modulus of a complex gap function (or what is
the same preformed fermion pairs) but there is no phase
coherence or no quasi-long range order. in order to de-
scribe this region we should incorporate into the theory
pairs with non-zero momentum and thus we should go be-
yond mean-eld approximation, for example by extract-
ing lowest gradient terms and setting up an eective xy-
model that serves for nonperturbative description of the
onset and disappearance of the phase coherence in a sys-
tem with preformed modulus of a complex gap function
|(x)|ei(x). this procedure was applied before by the
author for description of an analogous phenomenon in
strong-coupling superconductivity [3]. in the case of chi-
ral gn model in 2 +  dimensions at zero tempereature
we discussed in a similar way depletion of condensate
by quantum uctuations [4]. existence of the pseudo-
gap phase in the chiral gn model at low n provide us
with example when generation of fermion mass happens
without spontaneous breakdown of continual symmetry.

chiral gn model has the following o(n )-symmetric

lagrange density

this model is invariant under the continuous set of chi-
ral o(2) transformations which rotate  and  elds into
each other. this model is closely related to another one
which resembles a bcs model of superconductivity. its
lagrange density is

here c is the matrix of charge conjugation which is de-

the -matrices as 0 = 1, 1 = i2, and c = 1, and
the second model goes over into the rst by replacing
2 (1 + 5)c t , where superscript t de-
  1

model in 2+1 dimensions see [5]. in the lagrange den-
sity (1) we introduce a complex collective eld by adding

within mean-eld analysis we have situation similar
to bcs superconductor when at certain temperature due
to thermal pair breaking gap disappears. in what follows
we shall call this temperure of thermal decomposition
of cooper pairs t .
it can be expressed via the gap
function at zero temperature. in two space dimensions
corresponding equation reads:

t  =

where 0(0) is gap function at zero temperature. near
t  the gap function has in the mean-eld approximation
following behavior:

0(t ) = t 4plog 2r1

let us start our consideration of the spontaneous sym-
metry breakdown in gn model at low n with a simple
example - a strong-coupling superconductor. symmetry
breakdown in the later can not be described by a mean-
eld theory and, as it will be shown below, its behavior
is in some sence analogous the the low-n behavior of gn
model.

the celebrated bcs theory of superconductivity is a
mean-eld theory and it describes superconductivity as
a pair formation - i.e. when pairs form at certain tem-
perature they have zero momentum and thus are con-
densed. obviously critical temperature in this case is
proportional to the energy of the pair binding. n  
mean-eld treatment of the gn model is quite similar to
the bcs theory of superconductivity. let us imagine for
a moment that we were able to bind cooper pairs in a
superconductor innitely tightly - obviously this implies
that characteristic temperature of thermal pair decom-
position will be also innitely high, hovewer this does
not imply that the long-range order will survive at in-
nitely high temperatures. as it was rst observed in [6]
long-range order in strong-coupling superconductor will
be destroyed in a similar way as it happens in super-
uid 4he i.e. tightly bound cooper pairs will acquire,
at certain temperature, a nonzero momentum and thus
we will have gas of tightly bound cooper pairs but no
macroscopic occupation of zero momentum level q = 0
and with it no long-range order.
in order to describe
superconductivity in a system with a strong attractive
interaction theory should incorporate pairs with nonzero
momentum and thus mean-eld treatment is invalid for
description of spontaneous symmetry breakdown in such
a system (see [6], [3] and references therein). this can as
well be understood in the following manner: at rst we
can derive eective potential for a strong-coupling super-
conductor, say in the simplest case it will be a mexican
hat potential that disappears at certain temperature.
the eective potential determines size of the modulus of
the complex gap function  = ei(x). bcs theory pos-
tulates that phase is constant and thus if we have eective
potential we have spontaneous symmetry breakdown [7].
however it will not be always the case if we have tightly
bound cooper pairs. that can be seen if we go beyond
mean-eld approximation by extracting lowest gradient
term and setting up an eective 3d xy-model with tem-
perature dependent stiness coecent, for description of
the onset or disappearence of the phase coherence [3].
with it we can see that in the weak-coupling limit, the
temperature of the phase transition of the eective xy-
model tends from below to the characteristic temperature
of the disappearence of the eective potential and merges
with it for innitesimaly weak coupling strength. thus
we arrive at some sort of aposteriori verication of bcs
behavior in this limit (i.e. in this limit if nonzero modu-
lus of the complex gap function  = ei(x) appears at
some temperature, at the same temperature phase coher-
ence is estabilished and continuous symmetry is broken).
in the opposite limit of strong coupling strength we can
see that the temperature t  of the disappearence of the
eective potential obviously continues to grow with the
coupling strength whereas the phase stiness of the eec-
tive xy model tends exponentialy to the constant value
n
4m that corresponds to the phase stiness of the bose

gas with density n/2 and mass 2m [3] (and with it the
temperature of the onset of phase coherence tc also tends
to a constant value that depends only on the mass and
density of fermions and does not depend on the coupling
strength). thus in a strong-coupling superconductor we
have a large region between t  and tc that is character-
ized by a complex gap function ||ei(x) with nonzero
gap modulus || but random phase (x) so the average
< ||ei(x) > is zero and thus no continuous symmetry
is broken. similar separation of the temperature of the
pair formation and kosterlitz-thouless transition can be
found in the case of two-dimensional superconductor (for
a recent paper and citations of earlier works see [3]).

now let us return to the gn model at nite tempera-
tures, where will nd analogous to described above situa-
tion at low n. we start with considerations of the system
in the case of exactly two space dimensions where we have
kosterlitz-thouless transition to quasiordered state. ex-
tention of this discussion to 2+ and higher dimensions
(where we have transition to the state with a proper long-
range order) is trivial. below we extract lowest gradient
term of the gn model and set up an eective xy-model.
this enables us to study relation of the mass generation
and the phase ordering in this model.

the result (13) for d = 2 renders the following form of
the kinetic term for the gn model with u(1) symmetry:

hkin =z dx

n
16

0(t ) tanh(cid:18) 0(t )

2t (cid:19) []2

(14)

phase disorder transition is very well understood in a
model eld theory involving a pure phase eld (x), with
a hamiltonian

h =

j
2

[(x)]2,

(15)

where j is the stiness of the phase uctuations. the
temperature of the kosterlitz-thouless phase transition
is given by [2]:

tkt =


2

j.

(16)

in three dimensional system with a similar hamilto-
nian we have transition of 3d xy model to the state
with proper long-range order.

in contrast to the ordinary xy-model in order to study
phase disorder trasnition in the gn model we should
solve a set of equations: equation for tkt (0, n ) that
follows from kinetic term and equation (8) for the gap
modulus 0(tkt , n ) that follows from eective poten-
tial.

let us rst consider the case of low n. from expres-
sions (14), (16), (9), (11) we see that in the regime of
low n tkt << t . in this regime temperature correc-
tions to the phase stiness are exponentialy suppressed.
thus at temperatures t << t  asymptotic expression
for kinetic term (14) reads

hkin =z dx

n
16

0(0)[]2

(17)

thus kosterlitz-thouless transition will take place at

temperature:

tkt =

n
16

0(0)

(18)

which at low n is essentially lower than the temperature
t  = 0(0)
2 log 2 at which gap modulus disappears (9) [8]. so
with decreasing n separation of tkt and t  increases.
lets us now turn to the regime when n is no longer low.
then from the expressions (14), (16), (9), (10) we see
that in this regime tkt tends from below to t . the
hamiltonian (14) in this limit reads near t :

hkin =z dx

from (19), (16), (9), (10) follows the equation for behav-

this equation shows merging of the temperatures tkt
and t  in the limit of large n from which follows restora-
tion of the mean-eld scenario for the quasi-condensation
in the limit n  . the ratio tkt /t  is displayed on

proportional to cuto: t    on the other hand tem-
perature of the phase transition of the 3d xy model can
be estimated as tc  2j/. then after extraction of
gradient term one can see that in the limit /0(0)  
sepration of t  and tc increases: whereas the ratio t /
tends to a constant value, the ratio t 3dxy

in this paper we have shown that gross-neveu model
with u(1) symmetry at low n posseses two characteris-
tic temperatures tc and t  > tc.
in higher than two
space dimensions modulus of the complex gap function
||ei(x) forms at some characteristic temperture t  al-
though phase is random so average of the complex order
parameter is zero: < ||ei(x) >= 0, temperature should
be lowered to tc in order to establish long-range order.
similar discussion holds in a purely two dimensional sys-
tem where we have as well three phases at low n: (i)
t > t  - high temperature symmetric phase with zero
local gap. (ii) t  > t > tkt - symmetric phase with
nonzero modulus of the complex gap function and ran-
dom phase. (iii) t < tkt low temperature quasi-ordered
phase.

in the large-n regime tkt tends from below to t 
and merges with it in the limit n   thus recover-
ing mean-eld scenario for the onset of quasi-long-range
order.

this result introduces an example in quantum eld
theory that mass generation (which is associated with a
modulus of the complex gap function) may happen with-
out spontaneous breakdown of continuos symmetry or, in
the case of a purely 2d system without onset of a quasi-
long range order.
