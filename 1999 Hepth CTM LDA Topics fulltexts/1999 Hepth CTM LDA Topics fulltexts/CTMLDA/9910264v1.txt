abstract

we introduce the basics of the nonabelian duality transformation
of su (n ) or u (n ) vector-eld models dened on a lattice. the
dual degrees of freedom are certain species of the integer-valued elds
complemented by the symmetric groups ns(n) variables. while
the former parametrize relevant irreducible representations, the latter
play the role of the lagrange multipliers facilitating the fusion rules
involved. as an application, i construct a novel solvable family of
su (n ) d -matrix systems graded by the rank 1  k  (d  1) of
the manifest [u (n )]k conjugation-symmetry. their large n solv-
ability is due to a hidden invariance (explicit in the dual formulation)
which allows for a mapping onto the recently proposed eigenvalue-
models [7] with the largest k = d symmetry. extending [7], we re-
construct a d -dimensional gauge theory with the large n free energy
given (modulo the volume factor) by the free energy of a given pro-
posed 1  k  (d  1) d -matrix system. it is emphasized that the
developed formalism provides with the basis for higher-dimensional
generalizations of the gross-taylor stringy representation of strongly
coupled 2d gauge theories.

1 introduction

a duality of the d = 4 continuum yang-mills gauge system to a kind of
string theory remains to be one of a few intuitive guiding principles to attack
nonperturbative dynamics of the strong interactions. among the circumstan-
tial evidences, the central role is played by the wilsons d  2 string-like
representation [1] of the strong-coupling (sc) series but in a lattice cousin
of the continuum ym theory. as it is well known, this particular expansion
(running in terms of the inverse powers of the bare coupling constant) can not
be directly extended into the weak-coupling phase relevant for the continuum
limit. nevertheless, we believe that (properly chosen) lattice y m systems
hide a stringy pattern relevant for the d  2 continuum gauge theories at
least in the regime being the continuum counterpart of the lattice sc phase.
to this aim, one is to consider a continuum d  2 y md model with a
nite ultra-violate cut o u v and suciently large coupling constant(s).

to support this idea, we refer to the well-studied d = 2 case, where
gross and taylor proposed an elegant stringy representation [2] of the large
n sc series in the continuum su(n) gauge system on an arbitrary 2d
surface. recall that a continuum y m2 can be directly reproduced through
the corresponding lattice gauge model with the action dened via the as-
sociated self-reproducing plaquette-factor [3, 4]. as a result, the pattern of
the proposed d = 2 representation is the same both in the sc regime of
a given continuum y m2 theory and in the sc phase of the corresponding
self-reproducing lattice model. the only considerable distinction is that in
the latter case one would deal with the discretized surfaces rather than with
the 2d manifolds. the crucial point is that, as far as the built in topological
data is concerned, this dierence does not matter. as a result, in both in-
stances the appropriate sc series can be reinterpreted in terms of statistics of
all admissible branched coverings (associated to the base-surface) described
canonically in terms of the symmetric groups elements.

the key-ingredient of the above d = 2 construction is the so-called
schur-weyl complementarity (see e.g. [5] for a review) between the lie and
symmetric groups. altogether, for y m2 it fulls the role of a bridge between
the symmetry and topology that makes it particularly suitable for construc-
tion of the gauge string representation. unfortunately, the proposed in [2]
technology can not be directly extended to d  3 . the purpose of the

2

present paper is to develope the basics of an approach which, among other
things, renders accessible higher-dimensional generalizations of the gross-
taylor pattern.

one of the central elements of our approach is the nonabelian duality
transformation. on the one hand, the latter can be considered as a natural
extension of the schur-weyl duality. on the other hand, it is to be viewed
as a realization of the long sought nonabelian version of the abelian trans-
formation well known in the context of the pure u(1) lattice system (see
[11] for a review). this generalization can be compared, in particualar, with
the recent conjecture of polyakov [6]. he advocated that the lattice abelian
transformation encodes the n = 1 string-like pattern which might be gen-
eralized (in a yet unknown way) for the u(n) continuum gauge theory with
an arbitrary n .

the gauge string construction, we keep in mind, is facilitated by the
formalism which is to synthesize both the nonabelian duality (i.e. symme-
try) and the topology of the branched coverings. we nd it appropriate to
introduce the former ingredient in a simpler setting that avoids entangle-
ment with the topology. for this purpose, we nd a simpler application of
the duality transformation constructing a family of solvable large n su(n)
matrix systems which are not tractable by other methods. the d > 2 gen-
eralization of the gross-taylor 2d stringy pattern on a lattice will be given
in a forthcoming paper [16].

in what follows, employing the nonabelian duality we design a map-
ping between the recently proposed solvable d -matrix eigenvalue-theories
[7] and a novel class of the d -matrix models which apparently are not of the
eigenvalue-type. there are a few reasons why the latter models are worth
studying by themselves. first, it provides with a rare example of solvable
multimatrix models nontrivially depending on the nondiagonal components
of the su(n) or u(n) matrices involved. as we will see, the mecha-
nism behind their solvability is dierent from that in the popular systems
computable owing to the built in itzykson-zuber integral [8]: the kazakov-
migdal model [9] together with the conventional and conformal multimatrix
systems (see e.g.
[10] for a review). second, generalizing the prescription
of [7], the new models can be viewed as the large n reduction of the asso-
ciated d -dimensional lattice gauge theories. in other words, the large n
partition function (pf) xld of the latter theory (dened on a cubic lattice

(1.1)

through the pf xr of the corresponding d -matrix model with the reduced

ducible representations (irreps) r  y (n )
n(),   {}, {} , and in the case
of (1.3) it is postulated that the numbers of boxes n() in the associated

young tableau are constrained by n() = pd1
the key-advantage of the eigenvalue-systems (1.2),(1.3) is that their large
n pf x (m)
is explicitly computed [7] employing the saddle-point (sp)
method applied to the irreps {r} . to construct the purported solvable
noneigenvalue deformations of (1.2),(1.3), we rst rewrite the pf x (m)
of
the latter systems in terms [7] of the d -products

which encode the fusion rules of the su(n) characters. i assert that the
reduction of the pf to the glr generating functional (1.4) takes place in a

the representation (1.6) is not particularly helpful to distinguish the glr
computable variety, we are interested in, from the generic d -matrix system.
the only explicit general structure is that the family (1.6) forms a natural
hierarchy graded by the rank k = d, ..., 1, of the [u(n)]k conjugation-
invariance

[u(n)]k : u()  g+

 u() g ,  = 1, ..., k , g  u(n),

(1.7)

where u factors are recollected into a set of  -families {()} . the deep
reason for the glr solvability of the k < d noneigenvalue-systems (i.e. for
their duality to the k = d models (1.2),(1.3)) is a specic hidden symmetry.
the latter becomes manifest only in the dual representation for the pf of
a k  d subvariety of (1.6) (including (1.2), (1.3)). extending the abelian
transformation [11], we propose the following dual variables: the  -species
of the integer-valued {()} -sets (parametrizing associated su(n) irreps

r ) combined with the elements of the symmetric groups nn s(n) . the

s(n) -valued degrees of freedom (being composed into the characters of
the corresponding tensor representations) act as the lagrange multipliers.
they facilitate the nonabelian fusion-rule constraints for the complementary
integer-valued elds i(), i = 1, ..., n  1, entering the construction within
the canonical s(n) -valued young projectors pr, r  y (n )
n

.

in the dual representation, the glr coecients in the pf (1.4) can be ref-
ered (owing to the schur-weyl complementarity [12]) to the simplest avail-
able fusion-pattern of the s(n) -valued young idempotents (yi) cr 
pr . it is the nonabelian duality which, as we will see, allows to reveal that
among (1.6) there are k < d systems with the same (as in the k = d
case (1.2), (1.3)) glr pattern (1.4) of the underlying yi fusion-rules. com-

plementary, the pivotal role of the nn s(n) -variables in fact foreshadows a

5

tight relation to the d  2 gauge string construction generalizing the 2d
pattern [2].

r

finally, the organization of the paper is as following. the details of the ex-
act duality transformation, applied rst to the eigenvalue-models (1.2),(1.3),
are discussed at length in in section 2. in particular, for the latter models we
rederive the glr form (1.4) of the pf x (m)
directly in the framework of the
dual representation. building on this formalism, in section 3 we construct
the glr computable k  d  1 subvariety of the d -matrix systems (1.6).
among the deformations, we select a k = 1 noneigenvalue-family specically
suitable for the discussion of the continuum limit (cl) in the correspond-
ing d -dimensional induced gauge theories. the algorithm to reconstruct
the latter theories is formulated in section 4. to address the issue of the
cl, in section 5 we rst transform the associated large n glr functional
(1.4) into the 1-matrix representation [7]. then we prove that the simple
criterion imposed on the latter 1-matrix system (formulated in [7] for the
k = d family (1.2),(1.3)) is valid in the case of the selected k = 1 variety as
well. for this purpose, following [7] we demonstrate that the link-variables
in the corresponding induced lattice gauge theory are localized {u(z)  1}
(modulo the relevant symmetries) which is tantamount to the regime of the
cl.

our conclusion emphasizes the major novel possibilities open by the pro-
posed approach. among other things, we assert one of the expected features
of the d > 2 gauge string representation (of the strongly coupled y md
theories) novel compared to the d = 2 construction of gross and taylor [2].
a few appendices contain relevant technical details of the derivations used
in the main text.

2 the dual form of d -matrix models.

let us introduce the concept of the nonabelian duality which is built on the
complementarity of the lie and symmetric groups (reviewed in appendix
a). in our opinion, the dual representation provides with the appropriate
mathematical framework to operate with the results of the generic multiple
u(n) or su(n) integrations like those dening the pf xr of an arbitrary
d -matrix model (1.6).

6

it is instructive to view the nonabelian transformation as the extension
of the abelian construction [11] dating back to the classical paper due to
kramers and wannier who discovered the selfduality of the 2d ising model.
for a brief review, take the most relevant for our analysis option of the pure
lattice gauge theory based on the u(1) group, i.e. compact qed in d  2 .
its partition function is dened as the multiple link-integral of the product

composed of the standard u(1) plaquette-factors z(u) = pnz n(u) q(n)

x u (1)

np,nl =

where u u (1)
= eil , while u(p) = ei[](p) is the holonomy around the p th
elementary plaquette of the base-lattice {p; l} consisting of nl links and np
plaquettes. in the abelian case, the crucial simplication arises due to the
fact that all u(1) irreps (labelled by n  z ) are one -dimensional, while
the u(1) characters

u(1) : n(u) = u n = ein

, n1(u)n2(u) = n1+n2(u) ,

(2.2)

form the so-called character-group [11] isomorphic to z . combining eq. (2.2)
with the simple structure the generic u(1) 1-link integral

z du u (1) u n (u +)m = [n, m]

, n, m  z0 ,

(2.3)

one easily derives the dual form of the partition function (2.1) as the con-
strained multiple sum over the integer-valued variables (assigned to the pla-
quettes)

np,nl =

np

yp=1 xn(p)z

q(n(p))

(2.4)

here the sum in the argument of the kronecker delta-function, running over
the 2(d 1) plaquettes pl which share a given link l in common, represents
the relevant u(1) fusion-rule algebra.

finally, one observes that the relevant u(1) (and more generally u(n)
or su(n) ) d -matrix models (1.6) are dened on the following reduced
base-lattice. topologically, this lattice is made (as it is clear e.g. from the

7

pattern of eq. (1.2)) from the set of the d(d  1)/2 distinct  -plaquettes
through the identication of all d  1 their  -links to match with the
topology of a d -cube with periodic boundary conditions. altogether this
conglomerate can be visualized as d(d  1)/2 mutually intertwined 2-tora.

2.1 the dual form of the u (n ) measure.

let us proceed introducing the dual representation of the functional mea-
sure in the nonabelian lattice vector-eld theories. recall that the measure,
considered as a distribution , can be dened specifying all the  moments 
of this distribution. on a given base-lattice, these moments are specied
dening at each link the set of generic 1-link integrals m g(n, m)p1...qm

z du(u)p1

{jn}d(u +){qm}

{lm}

(2.5)

composed from the n n matrices (u)pk
lk in the (anti)fundamental
representation of the lie group g in question. the crucial observation is that
m g(n, m) can be dually reformulated in terms of the s(n) -valued variables.
in particular, in the g = u(n) case m u (n )(n, m) reads

jk , (u +)qk

m u (n )(n, m)p1...qm

j1...lm = [n, m] xs(n)

(2.6)

generalizing the u(1) pattern (2.3). the derivation of the identity (2.6) is
given in appendix b, and here we simply explain the meaning of its building
blocks. the factor d() stands for the canonical tensor representation of a
given s(n) -algebra element  deduced (by linearity) from the representa-
tion [12] of a s(n) -group element

{jn} =

i(n)

 : k  (k) , k = 1, ..., n,

(2.7)

while the introduced in (2.6) operator (1)
ing to the family

 s(n) can be viwed as belong-

(m)

n = xry (n)

n

dr (n! dimr/dr)m cr , m  z ,

(2.8)

8

which is expressed in terms of the dimensions dr and dimr of the s(n) -
and (chiral) u(n) -irreps r  y (n )
respectively. as for the operator cr 
s(n) in eq. (2.8), it denotes the canonical young idempotent proportional
pr = drcr to the young projector pr [12] (see appendix a for more
details)

n

pr =

dr
n! xs(n)

r()  , r  yn ,

(2.9)

where r() is the corresponding character. summarizing, one observes
that the s(n) -representation (2.6) of the 1-link integral (2.5) establishes
a remarkable duality extending the schur-weyl complementarity (see ap-
pendix a for a review of the latter). considered as the operators acting on
|p >n |q >n -space, the left and right hand sides of eq. (2.6) belong to
the complementary structures: the lie group ring and the symmetric group
algebra (being augmented by the integer-valued elds parametrizing irreps
r ) respectively.

next, in contradistinction to the u(n) case, the su(n) 1-link inte-
gral (2.5) doesnt vanish provided that n = m mod n [14] which makes it
generically more complex.
in the context of the d -matrix systems (1.6),
the important simplication arises because (without loss of generality) the
total amounts n() of the u factors in each trace-product of (1.6) can
be constrained to be equal for each  . in other words, given the numbers
n(q)
 () of the u factors entering corresponding traces tr(uq uq...uq ) ,
we postulate that

n+() = n()  n() ,  ; n() =

p

xq=1

n(q)
 ().

(2.10)

in turn, the constraint (2.10) ensures that the action in the associated d -
matrix su(n) subfamily of (1.6) is invariant under the d copies of the
transformations

[u(1)]d : u  tu ,

t  u(1) ,

(2.11)

taking values in u(1) rather than in the center-subgroup t = zn of
su(n) . as a result, the nondiagonal moments m su (n )(n, m) , n 6= m ,
do not contribute into the pf xr , while in the remaining diagonal in-
tegrals m su (n )(n, n) the su(n) link-variables can be substituted by the

9

u(n) = [su(n)  u(1)]/zn ones

m su (n )(n, n) = m u (n )(n, n) , n  z0 ,

(2.12)

as it is proven in appendix b.

2.2 the dual form of the d -matrix actions.

complementary to the reformulation (2.6) of the measure, a generic d -
matrix action (1.6) can be rewritten in a more concise synthetic form com-
bining both the normal u i
j -variables and the dual degrees of freedom. as
a result, integrating out {u} with the help of the s(n) -formula (2.6), the
pf xr of (1.6) can be expressed in terms of the dual variables only.

it is appropriate to recall rst the synthetic representation of the su(n)

group characters (see e.g. [5])

r(u) =

1

n! xs(n)

r()t rn[d()u n] = t rn[d(cr)u n] ,

(2.13)

associated to the set of irreps r  y (n )
with the young tableaus containing
a given number n of boxes. eq. (2.13) simply rewrites the frobenius formula
[14] in terms the conventional algebraic notations

n

t rn[d()u n] =

n

xi1i2..in=1

u

i(1)
i(2)
i1 u
i2

...u

i(n)
in =

n

[tr(u k)]pk ,

yk=1

(2.14)

where   [1p12p2...npn] , i.e.  belongs to the s(n) conjugacy class []
dened by the associated partition of n : pn
k=1 k pk = n . note also that the
complete set of r(u) is expressed (see e.g.
j -
factors, while (u +)i

[14]) with the help of (u)i

j is not engaged.

topologically, each individual trace tr(u k) in eq. (2.14) can be visualized
by the k -fold winding of a path around a single base-cycle associated to the
u -factor. to generalize the 1-cycle construction (2.14) for the case of the d -
matrix action (1.6), consider rst a single closed q -loop tr(uq uq...uq ) .
one observes that the latter trace can be visualized now by a path wrapped,

10

according to the structure of the associated word w(s)
, around the d in-
dependent  -cycles of the base-lattice.
in turn, any ( c(2m) -cyclic sym-
metrized) word ... (constrained for simplicity by (2.10)) of a length

q

2m = 2ld

=1 m can be reproduced

tr(uu...u) = t r2m[d({m})

d

o=1(cid:16) (u)m  (u +

 )m(cid:17)] ,

(2.15)

with the help of the equivalence class [{m}] of the 2m -cycle permuta-
tions {m}  c(2m) dened modulo certain conjugations (immaterial for
our present discussion). more explicitly, the structure of the r.h.s. of eq.
(2.15) adopts the pattern (2.14) to the presence of the 2d dierent u , u +

basis-factors

[(u1)

i(1)

],

(2.16)

where the mapping n  (n), n = 1, ..., 2m, denes the s(2m) permuta-
tion {m} .

next, eq. (2.15) by the same token represents a generic {w(s)

k }n(+) prod-
uct of traces (with 2m = n(+) ) entering the d -matrix action (1.6) con-
strained by (2.10). for this purpose, one is to choose such ({w(s)
k })  s(2m)
that can be decomposed into the ordered product  = p p()
k=1 cnk of the
nk -cycle permutations cnk reproducing the trace-product in question. sum-
marizing, the exponent of the d -matrix action (1.6) can be reformulated in
the following synthetic form

d

esr({u}) = x{n}

re[x

{n}()t r4n+[d()

(u)n  (u +

 )n],

o=1

(2.17)
where n  z0 , 2n+ = pd
=1 n , and   s(4n+) . we remark also
that in fact the associated to (2.17) pf xr remains invariant under the
substitution re[..]  [..] , i.e. one could omit the selection of the real part
of the combination in the rectangular brakets of (2.17).

as our attention is restricted to the solvable deformations of (1.2),(1.3),
we impose extra condition that {n}() is functionally parametrized by a

11

set {r  y (n )

n } of the relevant su(n) irreps

{n}() = x{r}

es({r}) {n}(|{r})

, n =

d1

x6=

n .

(2.18)

as a result, the d -matrix action (2.17)/(2.18), being dened in terms of the
{{n()}} -set of the s(4n+) -algebra elements

{n()} = xs(4n(+))

{n()}()  = x{r}

es({r}) {n()}({r}),

(2.19)

can be resummed in terms of the alternative set of the (properly normalized)
operators {n()}({r})  s(4n+),   {}, {}, weighted by a numerical
factor es({r}) . note also the advantage of choosing the su(n) option of
the d -matrix models (1.6), (2.10), where the su(n) link-variables can be
extended (according to (2.12)) to the u(n) ones. in this way, we combine
the simpler structure of the u(n) 1-link integral (2.6) with the more com-
pact pattern (2.13) of the su(n) characters (implicitly entering the action
through the operators (2.19)).

summarizing, in the nonabelian case the dual representation introduces
the extended (compared to (2.4)) set of the dual variables: the integer-
valued {()} -elds parametrizing the relevant irreps r are complemented
by the elements of the nn s(n) -algebra. in the particular case of the su(n)

glr generating functionals (1.2),(1.3), the pertinent dual degrees of freedom
t the pattern

s(n) ; {}  [zn /s(n)] d(d1)

2  [zn /s(n)]d },

(2.20)

{ on

where, for a given   {}, {} , each {()} -sector is composed of the
su(n) sets of n  1 nonnegative integers {su (n )} = {1 > 2 > .. >
n 1 > 0} . the latter enter the scene through the relevant young idempo-
tents cr .

2.3 d -matrix amplitudes v.s. t r4n(+) -characters.

let us now put together the dual pattern (2.6) of the measure and the syn-
thetic representation (2.17) of the d -matrix action. to take advantage of the

12

large n limit, we change the relative order between the integration q{} du
and the summation (2.18) over {r} : for a f inite n , one is to integrate
out the {u} -variables (containing the o(n 2) degrees of freedom) in the
rst place. to justify this interchange, the weight-function {n}() in eq.
(2.17) should provide, for any nite n , with the absolute and unif orm
in u  u(n) convergence of the {n} -series.
in the dual reformulation
(2.20), the integral over {u} is traded for the sums (2.6). therefore, the
summation over the nn s(n) -elements (for each particular {n} ) is to be
performed prior to the remaining sum over the o(n) degrees of freedom
parametrizing irreps r involved into (2.18) and (2.6). the resulting eec-
tive {r} -theory (generalizing the functional (1.4)) can be approached, at
least in principle, by the subsequent large n saddle-point analysis.

following the proposed strategy, one is to express the d -matrix pf xr

as the weighted sum of the master-integrals

t r4n(+)[d(a{n})] = z t r4n(+)[d({n})d({u  u +

 })]

d

y=1

du,

(2.21)

equal to the character of the corresponding master-elements a{n()} (belong-
ing to the the s(4n(+)) -algebra) in the tensor representation. in eq. (2.21)
we have dened (following eq. (2.17))

d({u  u +

 )}) 

d

o=1(cid:16) (u)n()  (u +

 )n()(cid:17) ,

(2.22)

where {n()}  s(4n(+)) is introduced in eq.
(2.19) so that the block
(2.21) is associated in eq. (2.17) to the subset of the terms summed up for
the particular partition {n  n()} of a given 2n+  2n(+) . to derive
the master-element a{n()} , in eq. (2.21) the result of the d dierent u -
integrations (2.6) is to be represented as an operator embedded to act in the
same enveloping s(4n(+)) -space where both {n()} and the complementary
block (2.22) (being considered as the operator) act.

for this purpose, let us rst specify a s(4n(+)) -basis suitable to accom-
plish our program. as it is reviewed in appendix a, each individual u or
u +
 acts on the associated elementary subspace u|i() >= (u)j
i |j() >
, u +
i |j+() >, i, j = 1, ..., n . thus, a given realization of

 |i+() >= (u +

 )j

13

the s(4n(+)) -basis is to be constructed as a properly ordered outer product
of the elementary building blocks |i() > . in particular, the ordering of
the {u} -factors in eqs. (2.21),(2.16) is associated to the following basis

| i4n(+) >=

d

o=1

|i2n() > ;

|i2n() >= |i (+)

n() > |i ()

n() >,

(2.23)

|i ()

n() >=

d1

o6=

|i ()
n() > ; |i ()

n() >= |i() >n() |i() >n(),

(2.24)

where 2n(+) = pd

=1 n() .

returning to the s(4n(+)) representation of the d 1-link integrations,
it is more eective to employ the alternative, s(2n) -reformulation of the
s(n)  s(n) formula (2.6) (see appendix b) which in the |i2n >= |i (+)
n >
|i ()

n > basis reads
z dud(u)j1...jn

i1...in d(u +)jn+1...j2n

in+1...i2n = d(2n(2n)((1)

n  1[n])){j2n}
{i2n} ,

(2.25)

n >= |i >n matches with |i ()

(2.24), and 1[n]
where |i ()
denotes the unity-permutation of the s(n) group. as for the operator
(1)

 s(n) , it is dened by eq. (2.8), while

n() > of eq.

(2.26)

n() > , and the antichiral, |i ()

let us restore the  -labels, i.e. n  n() . for a given link  , the left
and the right s(n()) -subblocks of (2n()) in eq. (2.26) act respectively
on the chiral, |i (+)
n() > , s(n()) -subspaces of
|i2n() > entering eq. (2.23). the same convention is used for the s(n()) -
subblocks in the direct product ((1)
(2.25). the
remaining s(2n) -operator 2n , being considered in the alternative ordered
basis for each |i2n() > -subsector

n  1[n]) entering eq.

|i2n() > | i2n() > = (|i+() > |i() >)n() ,

(2.27)

(with |i() >n()= d1
product of the 2-cycle permutations c2  c(2)

6= |i() >n() ), takes the simple form of the outer

2n() = (c2)n()  s(2n())

;

c2 : {12}  {21} ,

(2.28)

14

with each c2  s(2) acting on the elementary sector |i+() > |i() > .
combining all the pieces together, the master-element a{n()} is supposed
to be constructed as the composition of the involved (into eqs. (2.19) and
(2.25)) s(n()) -valued operators embedded to act in the common envelop-
ing s(4n(+)) -space.

let us apply this algorithm in order to rederive the glr pattern (1.4)
directly evaluating the master-integrals (2.21) associated to the eigenvalue-
models (1.2) or (1.3). given the basis (2.23), the corresponding to (1.3)
operator {n()} assumes (after identication s(1)({r}) = s({r}) in eq.
(2.19)) the following form

(1)

{n()}({r}) =

d

o=1

k (1)

2n()

; k (1)

2n() = (cr o [d1
6= cr ] reproduces k (2)

6= cr ]),

(2.29)

while the substitution cr  [d1
2n() of the option
(1.2). by denition, each cr -factor in eq. (2.29) is postulated to act on
the corresponding |i ()
n() > subspace of (2.24), while each cr -factor acts
on the associated |i (+)
n() > subspace.

actually, a preliminary variant of the glr pattern (1.4) can be deduced
from (2.29) already at this step. for this purpose, one is to combine the
the peculiar structure of the dual (m)
{n()}({r}) - operator (2.29) with the
invariance of any d -matrix action (2.17) with respect to the substitution of
{n()} by its twisted partner

to arrive at the structure which foreshadows the d -products (1.4) of the
glr coecients.

as for the invariance (2.30), it is a consequence of the basic commutativity
[d(), u n] = 0,   s(n) (see appendix a). the latter ensures that the
ordered product (2.22) (associated to the | i4n(+) > -basis (2.23)) is equal to
its  twisted  counterpart

(2.33)

where ()  s(n()) . being rewritten in the |i 
4n(+) > basis (2.31), it
matches with (2.30). remark also that, compared to eq. (1.5), the decom-
position (2.32) involves a larger set of the glr coecients of pth order: the
involved irreps r are parametrized by the s(n) , rather than su(n) ,
young tableaus yn (see appendices a and d for the relevant details).

returning to the derivation of the master-element a(m)

{n()} associated to
the eigenvalue-models (1.2),(1.3), one is to put together eqs. (2.21), (2.25)
and (2.29). prior to the twisting (2.30), it results in

6= cr]) reproduces
a(2)
inside the
t r4n(+) character (2.21), the expression (2.34) can be further simplied to
end up with the glr functional (1.4). first, according to the invariance
(2.30), the operator (m)
{n()}({r}) can be substituted by its (+  ) -
twisted partner. combining it the identity which in the |i2n > -basis reads

(2n) [+  ] = [  1[n]] (2n) [+  1[n]]

,   s(n),

(2.35)

let us note that the invariance with respect to the latter substitution
independently follows from [pr, ] = 0, , and the identity (b.7) of ap-
pendix b. the latter formulas ensure that in eq.
(2.34) the product of
the operators, complementary to (1)
{n()}({r}) , belongs to the center of
=1s(n())]n[d
[d
=1s(n())] (with each of the s(n()) -factors acting on
the corresponding |i ()
the subgroup corre-
sponding to the conjugations (2.30). in turn, together with (2.35) it justies
the validity of the twisting (2.36) of a(1)
{n()}
one reproduces the product of the glr coecients which matches (after some
auxiliary trick discussed in section 5.1) with the m = 2 case of (1.4).

{n()} . similarly, for the option a(2)

n() > -subspaces of (2.31)), i.e.

to ensure that the remaining factors in (2.36) conspire to reproduce ex-
actly the correct glr functional (1.4), one is to use rst the dening property
of 2n which in the basis |i2n >= |i (+)

n > assumes the form

n > |i ()

t r2n[d((+  ) 2n)] = t rn[d(+)]

,   s(n) ,

(2.37)

where  acts on the corresponding |i ()
with the completeness condition

(2.38)

and the projection-formula, which tells that t rn[d(pr)] (where pr =
drcr and r  y (n )

) is nonzero only for r  yn when

n

t rn[d(pr)] = dimr r() , r  y (n )

n

,

(2.39)

we nally rederive (1.4).

in conclusion, let us compare how the nonabelian fusion-rules constraints
are realized in the original and dual representations. in the former, normal
formulation (1.4), the conditions on the admissible irreps r are imposed by
the products of the glr coecients. on the side of the dual representation,

the fusion rules are realized in terms of the nn s(n) degrees of freedom
(2.20) combined into the t r4n+ -characters (2.21). owing to the inherent
combinations of the young idempotents cr , algebraically the symmetric
groups variables play the role of the s(n) -valued lagrange multipliers
(absent in the abelian case (2.2)).

17

3 glr-computable d -matrix pfs.

now we are in a position to formulate the concept of the symmetry, which
underlies the resolution of the fusion rule algebra in terms of the glr co-
ecients (1.5) for a subvariety of the d -matrix systems (1.6),(2.10) graded
by the rank k = 1, ..., d of the conjugation-invariance (1.7). since this
symmetry is not manifest in the original formulation (1.6) (based on the
word-parametrization of the traces involved), one can view it as the hidden
symmetry of the system.

the idea is to induce the k < d glr solvable systems generalizing the
k = d operator (m)
{n}({r}) (dened for m = 1 in eq. (2.29)) in such a
way so that the following basic property of the latter operator is preserved.
namely, the invariance of a generic d -matrix action under the twisting
(2.30) of {n} must be transformed into that under the complementary
twisting (akin to (2.32)) of the {cr} -factors entering (m)
{n}({r}) in the
master-integral (2.21). one easily observes that the required symmetry
(with respect to the switching of the (+) -twist (2.33) from the {u} -
to the {cr} -block) holds true provided in eq. (2.21) {n} is chosen in the
following form

{n} = x{r}

ee({r}) (m)

{n}({r}) {n}({r}),

(3.1)

where (m)
{n}({r}) is determined by eq. (5.4), e({r}) is some numerical
weight-factor, while   {}, {} and m = 1, 2 . as for {n} , it can be

an arbitrary element belonging to the center of any subalgebra s n s
of s(2n+)n s(2n+) (in what follows we employ the |i 
4n+ > -basis (2.31))

which contains the subsubalgebra

[d

=1s(n)] o [d

=1s(n)]

(3.2)

inherent in the twisting (2.33). more generally, {n} should commute with
any element of the group-product (3.2) that can be concisely formalized by
the pattern

{n} =

1

[n( s)]2 x{ s}

[+  ]1m{n}({r}) [+  ] ,

(3.3)

18

where n( s) denotes the number of the elements in s , while m{n} a pri-
ori may be a generic element of the s(4n+) algebra (consistent with the
convergence of the nal summation (2.17) over {n}  [z0]d ).

depending on the choice of m{n} and the admissible subgroup s 
s(2n+) , the resulting (via (3.1) and (2.21)) d -matrix action (1.6) is endowed
with the conjugation-symmetry (1.7) of a dierent rank k . in what follows,
we concentrate on the simplest case when s = s(2n+), n( s) = (2n+)!,
resulting in the k = 1 subvariety of the models (1.6) which can be viewed as
the noneigenvalue deformations of the two basic k = d systems (1.2),(1.3).
to develope an intuition in what is going on, let us obtain the explicit form
of the associated d -matrix actions with the arguments restricted to the
subspace of the coinciding link-variables: u = u,  = 1, ..., d . in this case,
there appears the larger symmetry under the switching of the extended
(s(2n+)  s(2n+)) -twisting (which generalizes (2.33))

the m = 2 option of (3.1) and choose the simplest separable form of m{n}

next, the analysis of the continuum limit (in the associated induced gauge
theory) will require the knowledge of the explicit relation between the two
weights: e({r}) (entering e sr({u })  e sr({u})|{u=u } ) and s({r}) in-
volved into the glr computable d -matrix partition function (1.4). to
derive a transparent example of such a relation, we concentrate on the de-
formations of (1.3) and specify the operator m{n} further in the form gen-
eralizing (3.5)

m{n}({r}) = [( m (1)

(3.10)

is introduced to trade e({r}) in the nal amplitudes for its r+ dependent
counterpart (and for simplicity we consider {r} -independent weights).

to begin with, employing (3.6) and the identities listed in the end of the
previous section, one easily obtains for the associated to (3.9) deformation
of the eigenvalue-action (1.3) (considered for the coinciding arguments)

let us now turn to the evaluation of the pf xr corresponding to (3.11).

the (+ ) -twisted operator w4n+ can be substituted by the 1[4n+] -unity
employing the proper change of the variables. indeed, let (4n+) and (2n)
are dened by eq. (2.26) in terms of   s(2n+) and   s(n) elements
respectively. making (for a given  ) the two shifts   [d

4 mapping onto the induced gauge theory.

in [7] we have developed the algorithm that associates to the k = d eigen-
value models like (1.2),(1.3) the d -dimensional induced gauge theory in such
a way that the correspondence (1.1) (between the the pfs) holds true. our
present purpose is to induce, preserving (1.1), gauge theories from the generic
k  d d -matrix systems (1.6) (invariant under (1.7) and (2.11)) including
those belonging to the glr computable variety dened via eqs. (3.1),(3.3).

to begin with, taking (1.2) as an example, let us briey review the algo-
rithm designed in [7] for the k = d d -matrix models. it consists of the two
steps. first, one employs the large n saddle-point method to prove that
the su(n) system (1.2) is reduced (eliminating the space-time dependence)
from the following d -dimensional eigenvalue-system. the latter is dened
associating to each site x (of ld lattice) the factor
x{r }

r (u(x))r (u(x + ))r (u +

 (x + ))r (u +

es y{}

 (x)),

(4.1)

22

where s  s({r}) and r  r(x)) . observe that the correspon-
dence between (1.2) and (4.1) implies the particular choice of the mapping
{u}  {u(z)} between the link-variables entering the pfs xr and xld
respectively.

the constructed in this way intermediate system (4.1) is invariant under

the local [u(n)]d conjugation-symmetry

u(z)  h+

 (z) u(z) h(z) , h  u(n) ,  = 1, ..., d,

(4.2)

combined with the reduced gauge symmetry with respect to the center t of
the lie group

u(z)  h +(z) u(z) h(z + ) , h(z)  t , t = zn ,

(4.3)

complemented by the global [zn]d -invariance

[t ]d : u(z)  tu(z) ,

t  t = zn .

(4.4)

the latter two symmetries substantiate consistency of the second step: the
gauge theory is induced from the system (4.1) through the gauge transfor-
mation

u(z)  g+(z) u(z) g(z + ) ,  = 1, ..., d,

(4.5)

introducing the auxiliary su(n) scalar eld g(z) assigned to the lat-
integration over g(z) with the haar measure (normalized by
tice sites.
r d g(z) = 1 ) results [7] in the associated eective theory with the mani-
festly gauge-invariant action sef f ({u(z)}) .

the pairing between the local conjugation-symmetry (4.2) and its global
k = d counterpart (1.7) is crucial for maintaining the large n correspon-
dence (1.1) between (4.1) and its reduced partner (1.2). being intended to
induce a gauge theory from the k < d noneigenvalue d -matrix models
(1.6)/(3.1), we propose to map preliminary these models onto the associated
eective d -matrix eigenvalue-theories. then, to maintain the correspon-
dence (1.1) with the latter eective theory, an appropriate modication of
the associated pattern (4.1) of the intermediate d -dimensional eigenvalue-
theory will be found. finally, the mapping (4.5) will produce, as previously,
an induced gauge theory.

23

to full this program, let us start with the construction of the eective
eigenvalue-theory associated to a given k < d model (1.6) which for sim-
plicity is restricted to satisfy (2.10) with n being additionally constrained
by

n =

d1

x6=

n

, n  z0 .

(4.6)

for this purpose, in (1.6) one is to rewrite u =  diag[ei()] +
 and then
integrate over ,  = 1, ..., d, employing (2.12) and the the decomposition
of the u(n) measure

zu (n )

du = z d

(4.7)

the point is that the integrations over the right -cosets   u(n)/[u(1)]n
can be extended, introducing the auxiliary matrix t  [u(1)]n , to those
over w spanning the full u(n) group-manifold (so that the dual represen-
tation (2.6) of the 1-link integral is applicable to this preliminary mapping).
second, the remaining integrals over t  diag[ei()]  [u(1)]n by the
same token can be promoted (introducing   u(n)/[u(1)]n ) to those
over u  u(n) which altogether reads d  d( t)  dw, dt 
 )  d u . in terms of this extended set of the variables, the pf of
d(t+

(4.9)

in the derivation of the second, su(n) form of xr

where the particular normalization ru (n ) du = 1 of the haar measure is
used.
in (4.8), we
employ the invariance of sef f ({ u}) under (2.11) (i.e. (2.10)) that allows to
apply the identity (2.12). to return from (4.8) to the original representation,

24

one absorbs  by the opposite shift w  w+
 of the w -variables
and then employs the commutativity t diag[ei()] t +
 = diag[ei()] . as for
the maximal k = d symmetry (1.7) of (4.9), it follows from the possibility
to reabsorb the  -rotations in the same way as we have done for  .

the action of the resulting eective su(n) eigenvalue-theory can be

dened by in the following form

 }) and the associated to {r(q)

(4.10)
 } numbers of boxes

to reconstruct an associated intermediate d -dimensional eigenvalue-
 

system, let us rst compare the pattern (4.10) with the one (where u (+)

(4.11)

that generalizes (1.2) remaining compatible with the algorithm employed in
[7] to induce a gauge theory. the d -dimensional eigenvalue-system corre-
sponding to (4.11) can be deduced from (4.1) substituting each  -block of
the characters by the more general block (where r(q)

 = r(q)

(4.12)

with the overall weight being given by s  s({r(q)

one observes that for d  3 the pattern (4.10) of the eective eigenvalue-
theory, according to frobenius formula (2.13),(2.14), generically can not be
reproduced in terms of (4.11) (resulting from (4.12) after the large n sp
reduction of the space-time dependence of u(z), r(q)
 (x) ). to adjust the
algorithm of [7] to the more general d  3 family (4.10), we note rst that
the latter systems can be reduced (eliminating the space-time dependence)
from the following d -dimensional eigenvalue-systems. the latter are dened

25

associating to each site x (instead of (4.1)) the factor

x{n} x{r(q)

(4.13)

which provides with the mapping {u}  {u(z)} alternative to the one
encoded in the pairing between (4.11) and (4.12). by the same token as in
[7], the pf xld of (4.13) is related to that xr of (4.10) through the large
n correspondence (1.1).

next, application of the second mapping (4.5) converts the d dimen-
sional eigenvalue-system (4.13) into an induced gauge theory. altogether,
this prescription provides with the algorithm which induces a gauge model
from a generic d -matrix system (1.6)/(2.10) including the k  d family
(3.1),(3.3) with the glr computable pf. the subtlety is that the interme-
diate eigenvalue-system (4.12) in addition is invariant under the (nite n )
local [zn]d symmetry

[zn]d : u(z)  t(z)u(z) ,

t(z)  zn ,

(4.14)

much larger than the zn gauge invariance (4.3). in turn, symmetry (4.14)
is present in the induced via (4.5) gauge theory that is known to set zero
the average of any wilson loop wc(u) = tr(u(x)u(x + )...u(x  ))
provided the corresponding to the contour c (minimal) area does not vanish.
therefore, it calls for a modication of the prescription to get rid of the
unwanted invariance (4.14) keeping (4.3) intact.

to circumvent this problem, we propose the following synthetic algorithm
dening the mapping {u}  {u(z)} for the link-variables of (4.10). first,
one is to use the frobenius formula (2.13),(2.14) expanding the characters
in (4.10) in terms of the trace products.
in the resulting sum, consider a
particular term (substituting u  u )

(4.17)

let the link-variables u in (4.17) be mapped onto u(z) of the intermediate

postulate that the set {m(1)
 ]2 , is con-
strained by the following condition. there should exist a set {m  z0}
of d(d 1)/2 integers so that the second {f

the latter condition evidently allows to map {u} in (4.18) onto {u(z)}

upon a reection, the above prescription remains essentially ambiguous.
to x the freedom of choosing the {m  z0} set, we impose extra con-

straint that the latter integers minimize p{}[m n]2 (where n enters

(4.6)). in case if there remains (accidental) residual ambiguity, one is to sym-
metrize over all the admissible options. summarizing, we have formulated the
algorithm to map a given d -matrix model (1.6) (constrained by (2.10),(4.6))
onto the intermediate d -dimensional eigenvalue-system which is invariant
under (4.3),(4.2). applying to the latter the nal mapping (4.5), we induce
the theory invariant under the conventional su(n) gauge invariance.

5 continuum limit of the induced theories.

the analysis of the continuum limit in the lattice gauge theories, induced
from the glr computable k < d models (1.6)/(4.6), essentially follows
the route employed in [7] for gauge theories induced directly from the k =
d models like (1.2). in what follows we briey sketch the major steps with
the emphasis on a few novel details.

the idea is to take advantage of the fact that the innite correlation
length in a gauge theory is supposed to entail the following eect. namely,
the link-variables u(z) are supposed to be localized (modulo (4.4) and the
gauge transformations) in the innitesimal vicinity, scaling as o(n (0)) , of the
group-unity element 1 . the gauge-invariant representation of this condition
implies the existence of some o(n 0) functional g2n  g2({gk})n  0 (of
the relevant coupling constants {gk} ) so that

where u(pl) = u(x)u(x + )u +
 (x) stands for the holonomy
around an elementary plaquette in an arbitrary  -plane. let us x the
maximal tree gauge [14] putting u(z) = 1 on a largest possible tree (made
of the links) which by denition does not contain nontrivial 1-cycles. then,
introducing the quantum uctuations aab
 (z)] , the required
localization can be formulated in the large n limit in the form

 (z) = iln[u ab

lim
n

lim

g2n0

(5.2)

following [7], we intend to prove that in the induced theory the constraint
(5.2) is fullled if in the associated d -matrix model (dened for deniteness
by eqs. (3.9),(3.21)) the condition

lim

< [aab

(5.3)

ensure scaling (5.3) we rst represent the d -matrix pf limn x (m)
as the
(md) th power of the eective 1-matrix su(n) theory formulated in terms
of irreps r

) is invariant under the group-product

(5.5)

combining the separate permutations within the two sets ( {} and {} ) of
the irrep-indices   {}, {} together with the simultaneous conjugation
of all the involved into eq. (1.4) irreps r .

as we will demonstrate, the condition (5.3) can be reformulated as the
following constraint on the saddle-point (sp) values of the j  z elds
canonically parametrizing the irreps r in the eective 1-matrix system (5.4).
namely, the sp values (0)
should approach innity according to
the complementary scaling -condition

with the functional g({gk}) (which enters (5.1),(5.3)) tending to zero.

to prove that (5.3) yields (5.1), we rst derive the 1-matrix representation
(5.4) of the large n pf (1.4) associated to the d -matrix model (1.6) spec-
in (5.4) is in fact con-
ied by (3.9),(3.21). as we will see, the sum pr
strained [7] by the condition that both n(r) and n( r) must be nonnegative
multiples of (d1) (where n(r) is the number of boxes in the young tableau
y (n )
n(r) associated to r ).



upon a reection, the pattern (3.20) suggests to start with a little bit

more specic m = 1 form of (1.4)

xr = x{r}

es({r}) l(d)

r+|{r} (cid:16) d

=1 l(d1)

r|{r } (cid:17) ,

(5.7)

where each sum over r  y (n )
n ,   {}, {}, +, runs over the  -
species of the su(n) irreps. as for the weight-factor s({r}) , it is dened
in (3.21) being invariant under the group-product (5.5), where z2 symmetry
is extended for  = +, {}, {} . next, integrating out in eq. (5.7) the

29

auxiliary r+ variable, one brings it into the required m = 1 form (1.4) with
the identication

es({r},{r }) = xr+

es(r+,{r},{r }) l(d)

r+|{r} .

(5.8)

returning to the reduction of (1.4) to (5.4), it is built on the localization of
the large n summations over {r}  {r} on the solution {r(0)
 }  {r(0)
 }
of the corresponding saddle-point equations. we refer to [7] for the discussion
of these equations, and now simply assert the properties of the solution in
the case when the constraints (5.5) are additionally imposed. to be more
specic, we select the option when the eective 1-matrix system in eq. (5.4)
is reduced to the simplest solvable class of the su(n) or u(n) models
with s(r|d) being dened as

where q > 0 , and in the su(n) case the set {gr({p})} is supposed to
maintain invariance of s({}) under the translations i  i + m . the
latter is to match with the fact that u(n) irreps are labelled by a set of n
integers u (n )

i=1 (i  (n  1)/2) = n mod n )

n < 0 . as for the sum pr

where the weight s(d)(r, r2) is deduced from s({r}, {r}) of (1.4)
through dimensional reduction (5.12). next, owing to the invariance of
(1.5) (in (1.4)) under (2.11), the su(n) partition function xr is invariant
under the substitution (2.12) of the su(n) link-variables by the u(n) =
[su(n)  u(1)]/zn ones. therefore, the sum in (5.14) over su(n) irreps

spectively.

31

finally, in order to recast eq. (5.14) into the form of eq. (5.4), let us rst

introduce

eh(r|d) = xr2

e s(d)(r,r2)

md

l(d1)

r|rd1

2

.

(5.17)

by the same token as in [7], the z2 -invariant pair of the d > 2 su(n)
conditions (5.15) is the only constraint dening the whole eh(r|d) -family
induced from the es(d)(r,r2)/md -variety via (5.17). it suggests to factorize
the latter constraints out

eh(r|d) = es(r|d) xk,kz

n(r),[d1]k n( r),[d1]k ,

(5.18)

so that, for a f ixed d , in (5.4) any residual r -valued function es(r|d)
(consistent with the scaling ln[ xr]  o(n 2) and with z2 -invariance
s(r|d) = s( r|d) ) can be induced through (5.17) provided the judicious ad-
justment of es(d)(r,r2)/md . the two periodic kronecker delta-functions
are supposed to be dened [7] via certain   -regularization of the poisson re-
summation formula (with explicit form of the latter being immaterial for the
present discussion). we note also that similar analysis of the u(n) glr
functionals (1.2),(1.3) (with the sum running over the u(n) irreps) results
in the u(n) counterpart of eq. (5.4).

in conclusion, let us remark that in the selected model (5.9) the appro-
priate scaling ln[ xr]  o(n 2), |j|  o(n), is adjusted [7] provided for
each r({p})  y2n the following pattern is valid

j = j/n , gr({p}) = br({p})n r

, r({p}) = 2  2n

xk=1

(5.19)

where it is postulated that br({p})  o(n 0) .

5.2 the {(< tr[u (pl)] > /n )  1} localization.

let us prove that, in the gauge theories induced via (4.5) from the k = 1 sys-
tem (1.6) (specied by (3.9),(3.21)), the required localization (5.1) of u(z)
is predetermined by the scaling-condition (5.6) for the {} elds entering
(5.4),(5.9).

32

to begin with, we recall that the constraint (5.6) is dynamically fullled
[7] provided in (5.9) all coupling constants (rescaled according to (5.19)) tend
to zero: {br({p})  0} . in the simplest case of the u(n) action (5.9) with
m0 = 1 , the functional g2 is to be introduced by

|dimr({})|q exp[gr0

xr({})

n

xi=1

(i 

n  1

2

)2]

, g2/2 = gr0 ,

(5.20)

where gr0  o(1/n) and r0 = [21] .
in a general case (5.9),(5.19), one
is to choose b2k = lim sup [|br|] as the largest |br({p})| in each k -subset of
r  y2k . then, n g2 is equated with the lim sup [(b2k)
k ] found among all
k  m0 (provided the associated leading terms, by themselves, ensure the
convergence of the {} -series in (5.9)).

1

next, building on the results of [7], one might expect that the scaling
(5.6) results in the complementary localization (5.3) of the link-variables
{u} in the d -matrix systems (1.6) specied by (3.9),(3.21). this assertion,
in particular, employs that the action (of the wc perturbation theory) in
the latter system evidently contains (owing to (3.11)) the quadratic in aab

term. in turn, the patterns of the involved mappings (4.8) and (4.5) suggest
that (5.3) indeed entails the required localization (5.1) in the gauge theory
induced from (1.6)/(3.9),(3.21).

to substantiate these statements by an explicit computation, we consider
the large n wc asymptotics g2n  0 of the properly normalized partition
function (pf)

ld = z y{,z}
x (in)

du(z)exp[s({u(z)})  s({1})]

(5.21)

associated to a (induced) gauge theory on a cubic lattice with ld sites. in
[7] it is shown that the localization (5.1) generically results in the power-like
large n wc asymptotics

lim
n

lim

g2n0

x (in)

ld (g) = [c gn

1

2 ](d1)n 2ld

, c > 0 ,

(5.22)

where the r du = 1 normalization of the haar measure is used, and c is

a model dependent constant. thus, our aim is to prove that (5.22) is valid

33

in the specic case of the gauge theories induced from the d -matrix models
(1.6)/(3.9),(3.21) constrained by (5.6).

for this purpose one rst observes that, according to the mapping (4.5),
the factor es({1}) can be rewritten as the partition function (pf) x (a)
ld of the
auxiliary d -dimensional model. the latter is deduced from the intermediate
d -dimensional eigenvalue-system (induced on ld lattice via the decompo-
sition (4.17),(4.18)) in the following way. namely, in the plaquatte-factor
dening the latter eigenvalue-system, one is to substitute the link-variables
u(z) by the composite eld

u(z)  g+(z) g(z + )

(5.23)

as it is predetermined by the pattern (4.5). consequently, the properly nor-
malized pf of the induced gauge theory can be represented as the ratio [7]

x (in)

ld = xld/x (a)
ld ,

(5.24)

where xld and x (a)
ld are the pfs (both normalized akin to (5.21)) associ-
ated to the intermediate d dimensional eigenvalue-system and the auxiliary
model dened through (5.23) respectively.

next, the correspondence (1.1) allows to express the large n limit of
xld as the ldth power of the pf xr of the k = 1 d -matrix model
(1.6)/(3.9),(3.21). as we will prove in the end of this subsection for the
particular case of the latter model, the {} -localization (5.6) results in the

power -like asymptotics (provided r du = 1 )
xr({gr}) = [b gn

lim

g2n0

, b > 0 .

(5.25)

being combined with the pattern (3.11))/(3.21) of e s(1)
r ({u }) , it ensures
the complementary {u  1} localization (5.3) of the uctuations aab
 .
similarly to [7], the pattern (5.25) is tantamount to the following large n
scaling-law (for each particular j )

lim

(5.26)

where j(), j = 1, ..., n, are the eigenvalues of u =  diag[ei()] +

entering the eective eigenvalue-theory (4.8). in turn, by the same token as

34

in [7], it ensures that in the auxiliary model (5.23) the su(n) eld g(z) is
localized (modulo (4.4)) in the vicinity of 1 so that

(5.27)

summarizing, we reproduce the purported asymptotics (5.22) of the pf of
the gauge theory induced from the k = 1 glr computable d -matrix model
(1.6)/(3.9),(3.21).

in conclusion, let us demonstrate that in the k = 1 d -matrix model
(1.6)/(3.9),(3.21) the large n wc asymptotics (5.25) is indeed valid. to
begin with, one readily obtains (from (3.11),(3.21)) for the action of the

in (3.12) can be identied with r of eq. (3.20)). next, recall that

according to eq. (5.12), the irrep r in eq. (5.4) represents the irreps {r}
entering the glr fusion-rules (1.4). owing to the pattern (3.11),(3.19),(3.21)
of the involved glr fusion rules, the scaling-condition (5.6) is valid for the
characteristic values of all species {(0)()},   {}, {}, +, parametrizing
the sp irreps {r(0)

 } (on which the relevant large n sums are localized).

next, the dimension-formula r({})(u) = detk,j(eikj )/detk,j(ei(n k)j )
together with (5.6) predetermines that each dimr contributes in the limit
n   with the scaling-factor [gn

eigenvalues j() of u u (n )
(entering the denition (1.5) of the relevant glr
coecients (5.29) modied by the extension (2.12)) satisfy (5.26) as in [7].

there would be no way to adjust the parameters of the latter weight to set up
the {} -localization (5.6). finally, we note also that the pattern of the large
n phase transitions in the gauge theories induced from (1.6)/(3.9),(3.21)
can be analysed in essentially the same way as it is done for the theories [7]
induced from the eigenvalue-models (1.2),(1.3).

6 conclusions.

in this paper we have introduced the basic concepts of the nonabelian duality
transformation and applied them constructing a novel family of solvable d -
matrix models (dened via (3.3)) graded by the rank 1  k  d  1 of the
manifest [u(n)]k conjugation-symmetry (1.7). the key-ingredients of the
transformation are the dual representation (2.6) of the u(n) 1-link integral
and the synthetic form (2.17) of a generic d -matrix su(n) or u(n) system
(1.6)/(2.10). combining these ingredients together, the partition function of
any matrix theory (1.6) can be rewritten in terms of the t r4n+ characters.
the latter are the traces of the dierent s(n) tensors (represented via
(2.7)) which, being composed of the dual variables, are embedded into the
enveloping s(4n+) space . the dual set consists of the integer-valued {}
elds (parametrizing via (2.18) relevant irreps {r} ) that are complemented
by the ns(n) -valued degrees of freedom (facilitating the fusion-rule algebra
of the young idempotents cr involved).

so far, the available solvable d -matrix models of the 1  k  d  1
type are mainly associated to the situations [15, 9] where an application
of the itzykson-zuber formula [8] transforms the model into some k = d
eigenvalue-theory of q (hermitean or unitary) matrices. the proposed non-
abelian duality suggests the alternative mechanism of the solvability realized
for the subclass (3.3) of (1.6). here the underlying reason is the hidden sym-
metry of the action which becomes manifest after reformulation in terms of
the dual variables. it is this somewhat unconventional symmetry which pre-

36

determines that the involved young idempotents satisfy the simplest pattern
(2.32) of the fusion-rules encoded by the glr coecients (1.5).
in turn,
the glr pattern allows to map the associated 1  k  d  1 systems
(1.6),(3.3) onto the d -matrix eigenvalue-models (1.2),(1.3) endowed with
the largest possible k = d conjugation-symmetry (1.7).

the latter k = d eigenvalue-models, being solvable in the limit n 
 , has been recently proposed [7] to reproduce the large n free energy
(fe) of the associated lattice gauge theory in d dimensions. generalizing
the algorithm of [7], the prescription is developed to reconstruct the gauge
theory with the fe ln[ xld ] equal (modulo the ld -volume factor (1.1))
to the fe ln[ xr] of a given 1  k  d  1 system (1.6),(2.10). the
new algorithm is applicable to any hypothetical solvable d -matrix model
(i.e. is not necessarily restricted to the subvariety (3.3)) consistent with the
[zn ]d -invariance (2.11).

as well as in [7], we address the question of the continuum limit in the
gauge systems induced from (1.6),(3.3). to clarify this issue, we choose the
judiciously constructed k = 1 family (3.9) constrained by (3.21). to be even
more specic, the 1-matrix model of the representation (5.4) is selected in
the simplest form (5.9). given this choice, we prove that the proposed in
[7] scaling-condition (5.6) (imposed on the eective 1-matrix system (5.4))
does ensure the required localization {u(z)  1} of the link-variables in
the associated induced gauge theories.

the major motivation for this project is to develope the formalism which
makes accessible the gauge string representation (of strongly coupled gauge
theories) yielding the d > 2 extension of the d = 2 construction due to
gross and taylor [2]. one observes that the proposed approach deals with the
structures which are already very similar in nature to those of [2]. the precise
reformulation of the amplitudes (in a lattice y m system), in compliance
with the pattern dening the data of the properly associated (generalized)
branched covering spaces, will be given in the forthcoming paper [16]. here
we announce only one important novel feature of the d > 2 stringy pattern
that is not present in the d = 2 construction. compared to the latter case,
in d > 2 one is forced to introduce certain generalizations of the canonical
branched covering spaces. this is foreshadowed algebraically by the necessity
to embed various s(n) operators (acting in dierent subspaces) into the
common enveloping space in a manner similar to what we have done in

a:

su (n ) /nn s(n) complementarity.

to facilitate the nonabelian duality transformation on the lattice, one needs
a piece of the formalism which we now focus on. let us start with the basic
facts about the action of the gl(n) (which can be further restricted to
u(n) or su(n) ) and the symmetric groups on the tensor spaces associated
to the structures introduced in the section 2.

recall that gl(n) is the group of the automorphisms of nondegenerate
( detv 6= 0 ) complex n  n matrices v j
i . given any basis {|i >, i =
1, 2, ..., n} on a n -dimensional vector space xn , the fundamental matrix
representation of gl(n) is dened canonically as v |i >= v j
i |j > . given
xn , one introduces the basis |i >n= |i1 > |i2 > ...|in > for the direct
product space x n
according to
the standard rule v n
{in} |j >n , where conventionally
d(v ){jn}
i1 (v )j2

p=1 |ip >= d(v ){jn}
i2 ...(v )jn

n . the elements of gl(n) act on x n
n

{in} = (v )j1

in  v n .

next, the representation theory proves (see e.g. [12]) that the symmetric
group s(n) is the most general group of transformations commuting with the
elements v n of the gl(n) on the x n
n . the elements of the s(n) -group
are represented by the linear tranformation

|i >n= |i1(1) > |i1(2) > ...|i1(n) >= d(){jn}

{in} |j >n

(a.1)

where d(){jn}
{in}
commutativity

is given by eq. (2.7), with the basic property being the

[d(), d(v )] = 0 ,   s(n), v  g .

(a.2)

38

the representation of the s(n) -algebra elements is deduced from the group-
representation (2.7) by linearity. remark that the unity element 1[n] of the
s(n) group is represented by the trivial permutation (a.1) 1[n] : (k) =
k, k = 1, ..., n .

{ni; n1  n2  ...  nk  0} constrained by the single condition lk

the central operation, we will employ, is the decomposion of the direct
product space v n (or, equally, (v +)n ) into the irreps of the lie group
or, dually , into the irreps of s(n) . recall that in the s(n) group the
irreps are labelled [12] by a set of k nonnegative, nonincreasing integers
i=1 ni =
n and visualized as the young tableau yn with n boxes. the u(n) or
gl(n) irreps can be parametrized in a similar fashion by a set of n integers
{ni; n1  n2  ...  nn } that is related to the alternative classication
(5.10) identifying ni = i n +i . when all ni, i = 1, ..., n, are nonnegative
(nonpositive), the associated u(n) -characters are expressed in terms of the
v - ( v + -) tensors only. the corresponding  (anti)chiral  sector of u(n) -
irreps can be visualized [12] by the u(n) young tableaus y (n )
containing
n = pn
i=1 ni boxes distributed in not more than n rows. in the su(n)
case, the complete set of irreps is labelled by the su(n) young tableaus
y (n )

containing not more than n  1 rows, i.e. nn = 0 .

the required decomposition of v n (or (v +)n ) can be canonically gen-
erated by the y (n )
- subset of the young projectors {pr} (dened by eq.
(2.9)) that belong to the center of the s(n) algebra:
[pr, ] = 0,   s(n) ,
r  yn . the tensor product v n is mapped [12] by an admissible projector
onto the dimr copies of the s(n) irrep tr or equivalently
pr, r  y (n )

where dr, dimr stand respectively for the dimensions of s(n) - and the
chiral gl(n) - (or, equivalently, u(n) -) irreps r respectively. in the case
of g = su(n) , one obtains in this way all the irreducible representations.
for g = u(n) , the space v n contains irreps included into the single chiral
sector of u(n) -irreps parametrized by the young tableaus y (n )

we deduce one of the central results of the representation theory, the so-called
schur-weyl duality (see e.g. [5])

v n = xry (n)

n

tr  tr

(a.5)

which formalizes the complementary roles of the lie and symmetric groups.

employing eqs. (a.3),(a.5), the formulas relevant for the duality trans-
formation can be represented in the concise algebraic form. first, taking
trace of the schur-weyl decomposition (a.5) and using the completeness
condition (a.4) for {pr} , one deduces (see e.g.
[5]) the second frobenius
formula

[](v ) = t rn[d()v n] = xry (n)

n

r()r(v )

(a.6)

or its modication t rn[d(pr)d()v n] = r()r(v ) following from eq.
(a.3). similarily, the rst frobenius formula (2.13) for r(v ) can be ob-
tained multiplying eq. (a.5) by d() and taking the trace as previously.

b: the dual form of the 1-link integral.

in this appendix, we derive the dual representation (2.6) of the 1-link integral
(2.5). to compute m g(n, m)p1...qm
j1...lm of eq. (2.5) for a particular lie group g ,
the starting idea [13, 14] is to dierentiate the simple generating function

n,m(a, b) = z dv (t r[av ])n (t r[bv +])m
f g

(b.1)

with respect to a, b  g .

b.1 the s(n) -form of the u (n ) formula.

in the u(n) -case the invariance (2.11) of the integral (b.1) under the u(1) -
subgroup of u(n) = (su(n)u(1))/zn ensures that it doesnt vanish only
for n = m . for fn,n(a, b), a, b  u(n) , one derives [13, 14]

f u (n )

qk (where a, b in the r.h.s. of eq. (b.2)
can be extended to gl(n) ), one obtains for the u(n) 1-link integral (2.5)

by the eq. (2.6), with the s(n) -tensors d() and (1)
being dened by
eqs. (2.7) and (2.8) respectively. note that, in (1)
the sum over the u(n)
g-irreps r  y (n )
is restricted to the single chiral sector parametrized by
the u(n) young tableaus y (n )
(containing not more than n rows). let
us remark also that eq. (2.6) is complementary to already existing represen-
tations [13, 14],[2] of (2.5) which are not suitable for our present purposes.

b.2 the s(2n) -form of the u (n ) formula.

the integration formula (2.6) can be represented in terms of the elements of
the s(2n) -algebra enveloping s(n)  s(n) . employing the ordered link-
basis |i2n >= |i (+)
n >= |i >n akin to (2.24)), one
rewrites eq. (2.6) in the s(2n) -form of eqs. (2.25),(2.26). by construction,
the chiral,
n > , sectors are associated
respectively to the rst and to the second s(n) -subblocks of (2.25),(2.26).
as for the operator 2n  s(2n) , comparing (2.6) and (2.25) one deduces
for its explicit form

which in turn can be concisely represented in the alternative ordered s(2n) -

d(2n) = d((c2)n)  s(2n)

(b.5)

of the 2-cycle permutations c2  c2 , c2 : {12}  {21} , where each individ-
ual c2  s(2) acts on the (|i+ > |i >) -subspace of | i2n > .

finally, we mention the commutation-rules

[ 2n , (2n) ] = [ (2n) , ((m)

n  1[n]) ] = 0 ,

(b.6)

where in the second case the above |i2n > -basis is employed. in particular,
it makes the relative order of the operators in the product (2.25) immaterial.
also, let us include the following useful identities

(2n)  (e(+)

n  e(+)

(a, b) .

let us prove that the diagonal su(n) moments f su (n )
(a, b) , dened by
eq. (b.1), are invariant under the substitution of the su(n) link-variables
by the u(n) = [su(n)  u(1)]/zn ones

n,n

v su (n )  (v su (n )  v u (1))/zn = v u (n )

, dv su (n )  dv u (n ) ,

(b.8)

that is tantamount to eq. (2.12). actually, the identity (2.12) for n < n
directly follows from equivalence [14] of any polynomial u(n) representation
with n < n to the corresponding su(n) one. but for n  n one needs a
more rened consideration (valid for any n ) we now focus on.

n,n

first, we note that the extra u(1) -factor in eq. (b.8) matches with the
auxiliary u(1) -invariance (2.11) which is implicit in the diagonal moments
f su (n )
(a, b) (while nondiagonal n 6= m su(n) integrals (2.5) are only
zn -invariant). to promote (within f su (n )
(a, b) ) the zn center-subgroup
(2.11) into u(1) , one is to multiply each v su (n ) by the auxiliary factor
v u (1) and then integrate dv u (1) with the u(1) haar measure normalized
to unity. the resulting pattern is to be confronted with the factorized rep-
resentation of the u(n) measure

n,n

that will be derived below. identifying the u(1) sector in eq. (b.9) with
the averaging over the auxiliary u(1) -transformation (that leaves diagonal
integrals f su (n )

(a, b) invariant), we justify the required formula (2.12).

n,n

to obtain eq. (b.9), recall rst that the explicit expressions [14] for the
u(n) and su(n) measures (after decomposition v =  diag[ei] + ) are
given respectively by eq. (4.7) and

start with the following observation. the outer product of two idempotents

cr1  cr2

(n1 + n2)! xs(n1+n2)

[  (cr1  cr2) 1 ] .

(c.3)

by construction, the twisted product (c.3) commutes with t  s(n1 + n2)
and thus belongs to the center (c.1) of the s(n1 + n2) -algebra. more gen-
erally, given v  u(n) we arrive at the pattern (2.32) of the fusion rules
of the s(n) -valued young idempotents. by the same token, one arrives at
the inverse of the identity (2.32)

next, in the framework of the duality transformation the fusion rules
(2.32) and (c.4) are realized in the tensor representation (2.7) and enter
only inside the associated traces t rm . consequently, according to the sec-
ond frobenius formula (a.6), it eectively eliminates the contribution of
those s(n) -irreps r  yn which do not correspond to a u(n) irrep
(i.e. do not belong to y (n )
n ). therefore, we conne our attention to the glr
coecients l(p)
r+|{rk}, l(p)
n . upon a reection, this
subset coincides with the coecients in the associated via (c.2) decomposi-
tion of the u(n) characters (with the irreps restricted to the chiral sector),
i.e. assume the integral form

where n+ = pp
k=1 nk . to prove this statement, one rst applies both sides
of (2.32) (or (c.4)) to v n+  u(n) and then takes the overall trace t rn+ .
employing the commutativity (a.2), we get rid of the sum over   s(n+)
and use the identity (c.2) which altogether results in (c.5). finally, let us
remark that a generic coecient l(p)
, can be represented
as a combination of the elementary, p = 2 littlewood-richardson (lr)
coecients l(2)

[12] (entering the two-character fusion rules).
