derivative expansion of the one-loop effective

action in qed

the one-loop eective action in qed at zero and nite temperature is obtained by
using the worldline approach. the feynman rules for the perturbative expansion
of the action in the number of derivatives are derived. the general structure of the
temperature dependent part of the eective action in an arbitrary external inho-
mogeneous magnetic eld is established. the two-derivative term in the eective
action for spinor and scalar qed in a static magnetic background at t 6= 0 is
calculated.

the problem of calculating the eective action in qed is an old one. its
history starts with the well known papers by heisenberg and euler 2, and
weisskopf 3. later, some results were obtained by schwinger 4 who, by using
the proper time technique, rederived the one-loop eective action for the case of
a constant electromagnetic eld. perhaps, the next most natural step in solving
the general problem is to take into account the eect of small deviations from
a constant conguration of the eld. it turns out, however, that the latter is
very dicult to realize 5,6,7,8.

here we present our recent work 1 that generalizes the previously known
results on the eective action in qed. there, in particular, the derivative
expansions up to two derivatives of the eld strength with respect to space-
time coordinates in scalar and spinor qed at zero and at nite temperature
are obtained (for some partial results in a non-abelian gauge theory see 9,10).
our method is heavily based on the very elegant and now widely developed
worldline approach to quantum eld theory 11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18. here we follow
a self-contained approach of ref. 1, so that even a non-expert in the eld should
understand all the details.

as is known, the one-loop eective action in qed reduces to computing

the fermion determinant

here d = d and the covariant derivative is d =  + iea. by denition,

. states |xi are the eigenstates of a self-conjugate coordinate operator x.
throughout the paper we use the minkowski metric, i.e.,  = (1, 1, 1) or
 = (1, 1, 1, 1), depending on the actual space-time dimension. and in
both 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 dimensions, we work with the 4  4 representation of the
dirac -matrices.

at nite temperature, the expression analogous to that in eqs. (1) reads

f (1)(a) = t ln det(id  m) =

the matrix element hz|u ( )|yi  hz| exp(i h)|yi (which has the interpreta-
tion of the evolution operator of a spinning particle), entering the right hand
side of eq. (4), allows a quantum mechanical path integral representation,

the integration in eq. (6) goes over trajectories x(t) and (t) parameterized
by t  [0,  ]. in addition, the denition of the integration measure assumes the
following boundary conditions

x (0) = y,
x0( ) = z0 mod(i),

(0) = ( )
xi( ) = zi

(i = 1, 2, 3).

(9)
(10)

note that, at zero temperature, mod(i) is absent in the boundary conditions.
since the path integral (in the case of nite temperature) includes the
integrations over worldline trajectories with arbitrary integer windings around
the compact (imaginary) x0-direction, the expression in eq. (6) splits into
the sum of path integrals labeled by the winding numbers. in case of spinor
qed, the weight factors of these separate contributions are given 13 by (1)n.
therefore,

,

(11)

 (0) = y and x(n)

where the boundary conditions x(n)
 ( ) = z + in0 are
assumed. note, that there exists a similar representation for scalar qed as
well. in contrast to the case at hand, in scalar qed, the integration over the
grassman eld (t) is absent and all the weight factors are equal 13 to 1. at
zero temperature we have only n = 0 term, and the sum does not appear at
all. we will see later, eqs. (19) and (20), that the same is true if we consider
the limit t  0 (  ) afterwards, i.e., all the terms with n 6= 0 go to zero.
let us consider the eective action in the case of a slightly inhomogeneous
static magnetic eld. we choose a version of the fock-schwinger 1 gauge for
the vector potential a(x),

a0(x) = 0,

(xi  yi)ai(x) = 0.

(12)

the latter leads to the series

ai(x) =

the integration variables in eq. (14) are subject to the following boundary
conditions, x(n)
( ) = 0 (note that the elds
x(n)
0,i (t) were preliminary shifted by y0,i).

0 ( ) = in and x(n)

0,i (0) = 0, x(n)

a very nice property of the path integral in eq. (14) is its factorization
into two pieces. one of them contains only the time components of the elds
and is, in fact, a gaussian path integral. the other contains the interacting
spatial components of the elds and, what is very important, does not depend
on the winding number n. after performing the gaussian integrations over
x(n)
0 (t) and 0(t), we obtain

this expression, in fact, is one of our most important results here. it states that
the temperature dependent part of the evolution operator is exactly factorized
from the part depending on an (arbitrary) inhomogeneous magnetic eld. the
latter, in its turn, puts a strong restriction on the structure of the one-loop
nite temperature eective action in qed. similarly, we obtaine the result in
scalar qed,

as is seen, the path integrals in eqs. (17) and (18) are almost the same as those
at zero temperature. the only dierence is due to the additional (gaussian)
integration over x0 at t = 0. the latter, however, is irrelevant since it just
modies the overall normalization factor 1/n .

the further integration (over the spatial components of the elds) can be
done only approximately. remarkably, the result in the case of a constant
background eld can be obtained exactly from the above expressions 1. that
is due to the fact that the integrals in eqs. (17) and (18) are gaussian in
that particular case. all the derivatives of an inhomogeneous background eld
appear in the worldline action only through the interaction terms. therefore, it
is convenient to develop the corresponding perturbative theory and formulate
the feynman rules for calculating the diagrams of interest. here we briey
outline these rules.

we observe that there are two dierent types of local interactions in
eqs. (15) and (16). the rst (bosonic) type contains only the bosonic elds,
x(t). the corresponding vertices are shown in figure 1. the other type in-
volves both the boson, x(t), and the spinor elds, (t). these latter produce
the vertices given in figure 2. regarding the notation, the integers in the ver-
tices denote the number of derivatives of the electromagnetic eld with respect
to space-time coordinates. some legs in the diagrams are marked by circles
and bullets. the circles correspond to legs related to the rst lorentz index
() of the tensor weight, f,1,...,n , assigned to the fermion vertices. the
bullets, on the other hand, mark those legs which contain the derivatives with
respect to the proper time. the latter act on the boson propagators attached
to the corresponding legs.

the rest of the feynman rules are easy to derive as well 1. in calculation,
one has to use the appropriate propagators of x(t) and (t) elds 1 for

a somewhat disappointing feature of the theory is an innite number of
local interactions (see eqs. (15) and (16)). fortunately, while working at any
nite order of the perturbative theory, one requires only a nite number of
those interactions.

omitting the intermediate calculations, let us give the nal results for the
rst non-trivial term in the derivative expansion of the eective action (free
energy) in qed. assuming that the background magnetic eld is directed along
the third spatial axis, we get the following expression for the two-derivative
part of the expansion,

in conclusion, here we derived the one-loop zero and nite temperature
eective potential (free energy) in spinor and scalar qed using the worldline
formulation of quantum eld theory. the only dierence (at one loop) between
zero and nite temperature cases appears in applying the boundary conditions
to the saddle point trajectory. by making use of this method, we were able to
established the general structure of the temperature dependent part of the ef-
fective action in qed in an arbitrary external inhomogeneous magnetic eld.
also, we established the feynman rules for calculating the perturbative ex-
pansion of the eective action (free energy) in the number of derivatives of the
background eld with respect to space-time coordinates. the explicit result
for the rst non-trivial term in the expansion (containing two derivatives of
the magnetic eld) is presented.
