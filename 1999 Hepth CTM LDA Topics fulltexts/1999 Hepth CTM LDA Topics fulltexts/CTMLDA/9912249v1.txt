abstract

it has been conjectured that at a stationary point of the tachyon potential for the
d-brane of bosonic string theory, the negative energy density exactly cancels the d-brane
tension. we evaluate this tachyon potential by o-shell calculations in open string eld
theory. surprisingly, the condensation of the tachyon mode alone into the stationary
point of its cubic potential is found to cancel about 70% of the d-brane tension. keeping
relevant scalars up to four mass levels above the tachyon, the energy density at the shifted
stationary point cancels 99% of the d-brane tension.

it has been argued on various general grounds that the classical tachyon potential on
a d-p brane of the bosonic string theory has a stationary point where the total negative

potential energy due to the tachyon exactly cancels the tension of the d-brane[1, 2]. at
this stationary point the conguration is indistinguishible from the vacuum where there
is no brane. a similar argument can be given for the tachyon potential on a d-brane

anti-d-brane system or a non-bps d-brane of type ii string theories [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
there is, however, no direct proof of these relations.

in this paper we demonstrate this phenomenon directly using string eld theory. we
restrict ourselves to bosonic string theory and use wittens string eld theory with cubic

action [9], although in principle the version of open string eld theory suitable for o
shell inclusion of closed strings [10] could have been used as well. the analysis could be

performed for superstring theories as well using open superstring eld theory[11]. the
background independent features of the tachyon potential noted in [12] make earlier stud-
ies of this potential in string eld theory [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]3 relevant to the problem of
d-brane annihilation. indeed, in a very interesting paper, kostelecky and samuel [14] gave
evidence that the stationary point of the cubic tachyon potential survives with control-

lable corrections the inclusion of higher mass scalars of the string eld expansion. further
evidence to this eect was given in [18]. it is this non-perturbative vacuum that we focus

on in the present paper. our present advantage is that we have an explicit conjecture
for the value of the potential at the stationary point we are looking for. hence we can
compare the results obtained from string eld theory with the conjectured value. as we

shall see, using a suitable approximation scheme, we can nd a stationary point of string
eld potential where the value of the potential is about 1% away from the conjectured
answer.4
the conjecture and the setup. some general properties of the tachyon potential in string

eld theory were analysed in [12], where it was shown that the tachyon potential on a
d-brane of bosonic string theory takes a universal form:

v (t ) = mf (t ) ,

(1)

where m is the mass of the d-brane5 and f (t ) is a universal function independent of

3for studies of the tachyon potential in the rst quantized formulation, see [19, 20].
4our calculations appear to be consistent with the related computations of [14, 18].
5we are assuming that all the directions tangential to the brane are compact so that the brane has a

nite mass.

the background in which the d-brane is embedded. the tachyon eld t and the function
f (t ) are dened as follows[12]. let h denote the space of states of ghost number one
of the two-dimensional conformal eld theory of the (b, c) ghost system and a matter
system of central charge 26 on the upper half plane, and let |0i denote the sl(2,r)
invariant vacuum of this conformal eld theory. let h1  h denote the space of states of
ghost number one obtained by acting on |0i with oscillators bn, cn, and matter virasoro
generators ln. the subspace h1 of h is a background independent subspace containing
the zero momentum tachyon state c1|0i and having the property that we can consistently
set the component of the string eld along h  h1 to zero in looking for a solution of
the equations of motion. since all elds in h1 may acquire expectation values, the real
problem is nding a stationary point of the string eld potential v (t ) associated to the
string eld |ti corresponding to a general state in h1. this string eld |ti, still called
here the tachyon eld, includes an innite collection of variables corresponding to the
coecients of expansion of a state in h1 in some basis.6

the function f (t ) is given by the following string eld theory expression:

f (t ) = 22(cid:16) 1

2hi  t (0)qbt (0)i +

1

3hh1  t (0)h2  t (0)h3  t (0)i(cid:17) .

(2)

here qb is the brst charge, and t (z) denotes the two dimensional eld which creates
the state |ti from the sl(2,r) invariant vacuum: |ti = t (0)|0i . i, h1, h2 and h3 are a set
of familiar conformal transformations[21] whose expressions were reviewed in [12]. given
any conformal transformation described by the function h(z), and a vertex operator (z)
of the conformal eld theory, h (0) denotes the conformal transform of (0) by h. thus
for example if  denotes a dimension d primary eld, then h (0) = (h(0))d(h(0)). for
non-primary elds there will be extra terms involving higher derivatives of h. finally h i
denotes the correlation function in the conformal eld theory of matter and ghost elds,
normalized so that hc1c0c1i = 1 .7,8

6although we shall refer to these coecients as elds, we should keep in mind that these represent

zero momentum modes of the elds corresponding to space-time independent eld congurations.

7note that this diers from the convention of ref.[12] by a factor of l,  the (innite) length of the
time interval. this is due to the fact that we are writing down the expression for the potential instead
of the action. we can make these two notations consistent by choosing l = 1; in that case the potential
can be identied to the negative of the action. the nal results of course are independent of l.

the conjecture of ref.[1] can now be restated as follows. in the space h1 there must

be a state |tci such that f (t ) has a stationary point at t = tc, and

f (tc) = 1 .

(3)

the total d-brane mass at t = tc vanishes: m + v (tc) = m(1 + f (tc)) = 0.

zeroth approximation. we proceed to verify this conjecture using a systematic approx-

imation scheme suggested by kostelecky and samuel[14]. in order to explain this proce-
dure, let us rst consider setting all components of |ti to zero except for the coecient
of the state c1|0i, a state that will be said to be of level zero. thus we take

|ti = t c1|0i .

(4)

substituting this into eq.(2) we get the zeroth approximation to the tachyon potential

we found it very encouraging that this zeroth order approximation to the vacuum energy

in fact, the o-
at the stationary point gives essentially 70% of the expected value!
shell choice of cubic string eld theory (as opposed to string eld theory with higher

order vertices) yields at this level the best possible approximation to the expected value.
indeed, the constant r dened above is essentially the mapping radius of the disks dening
the three string vertex [16], and it is maximal for the vertex of the cubic theory. thus
|f (tc)| is maximal for this choice.
subsidiary conditions on t . in order to compute corrections to this result, we need to

include the higher level elds in our analysis. the analysis can be simplied by noting
that the potential (2) has a twist symmetry under which all coecients of states at odd
levels above c1|0i change sign, whereas coecients of states at even level above c1|0i

4

remain unchanged [14, 22].9 thus coecients of states at odd levels above c1|0i must
always enter the action in pairs, and we can trivially satisfy the equations of motion of
these elds by setting them to zero. thus we look for solutions where |ti contains only
even level states. with the state c1|0i dened to be at level zero, the additional elds we
must consider will be at levels two, four, and higher. at level two, for example, we nd
three states, c1|0i, l2c1|0i and b2c0c1|0i.

we can further simplify the expansion by using the feynman-siegel gauge:

b0|ti = 0 .

(8)

this gauge choice can be justied by rst showing that such a gauge can be chosen at the
linearized level, and then assuming that the elds are small enough so that we can continue
to make this gauge choice even in the presence of interactions. the proof of validity of this
gauge at the linearized level proceeds as follows. let |t (2n)i denote an arbitrary level 2n
state in h1. let us dene |(2n)i = b0|t (2n)i . then | et (2n)i  |t (2n)i(2n1)1qb|(2n)i
satises the desired gauge condition b0|et (2n)i = 0.10 this shows that for n  1, it is
possible to gauge transform a general level 2n state |t (2n)i to a state |et (2n)i satisfying

the feynman-siegel gauge.

the equations of motion in the feynman-siegel gauge are equivalent to the equations

of motion of the gauge invariant action if there are no residual gauge transformations
which act non-trivially and preserve the gauge, i.e. if there are no pure gauge directions
inside the subspace (8). assume there is pure gauge direction |(2n)i satisfying the gauge
condition (8). then, qb|(2n)i = 0, and together with the gauge condition (8), gives
0 |(2n)i = {qb, b0}|(2n)i = 0. since ltot
0 |(2n)i = (2n  1)|(2n)i, we see that |(2n)i
ltot
must vanish, as we wanted to show. hence the feynman-siegel gauge is a valid gauge
choice for suciently small eld congurations.

approximation with level two elds. using the feynman-siegel gauge we have

|ti = tc1|0i + uc1|0i + v

l2c1|0i ,

(9)

9the origin of this symmetry can be traced to the relations h1(z) = ei(h3(z)), h2(z) = ei(h2(z)),
and h3(z) = ei(h1(z)), where ei(y) = 1/y is a combination of the sl(2,r) and world-sheet parity
transformations. in the restricted sector h1 the world-sheet parity as well as sl(2,r) is a symmetry of
the theory.
10in deriving the above equation we have used that (a) {qb, b0} = ltot
n denoting the
combined virasoro generators of the matter and the ghost sectors, (b) b0|(2n)i = 0 due to the relation
(b0)2 = 0, and that (c) the ltot

eigenvalue of a level 2n state is (2n  1).

which includes the two level two elds u and v. the (1/13) factor in the last term
was chosen for convenience (lns denote matter virasoro generators.). at this stage we
can simply substitute (9) into (2) and nd f (t, u, v), but there is a further approximation
which is possible[14]. for this let us dene the level of a given term in f (t ) as the sum of
the levels of all the elds appearing in this term. we can now approximate the potential

f (t ) by keeping only terms up to a certain level. since the quadratic terms involving
level two elds is already level four, it does not make sense to truncate the potential to

terms below level four once we have included the level two elds in our analysis. thus
the next approximation to the potential, f (4), will be obtained by substituting in (2) the
expansion (9) and keeping only t3, t2u, t2v, tu2, tv2 and tuv interaction terms. since we
cannot have elds appear in interactions before their quadratic terms appear, we dene
the level 2n approximation f (2n) to contain all interaction terms up to level 2n built from
elds up to level n. thus at level six, we do not include any new elds (odd level elds
are set to zero) but we need to include four new interactions: u3, v3, u2v and uv2.

ref.[14] evaluated the potential up to level six and found that the stationary point of
the potential persists up to this level. their result, when translated into the normalization
convention of this paper, is as follows.11 at level four the potential is given by

f (4)(t ) has a stationary point12 at tc (tc  0.542, uc  0.173, vc  0.187) at which
f (tc)  0.949. this is about 95% of the expected answer 1!13
11in order to convert the result of ref.[14] to our convention, we need to set  = 1 and g = 2 in the
expressions given in ref.[14], and multiply their potential by a factor of 22. the elds t, u and v used in
our paper correspond to their elds , 1 and b respectively.
12strictly, this point is not a minimum of the potential, nor even a local minimum. this is not
necessarily problematic. the string eld theory has ghost and auxiliary modes with negative mass
squared that are not physical tachyons. the eld u appearing in (10) is an example of this. we still
expect physical stability of this stationary point.

13since ref.[14] did not have a reference scale to compare with, they expressed the potential in units
of the string tension and the on-shell three tachyon coupling, and concluded that the potential is quite
shallow. on the other hand, using the mass of the d-brane as the reference scale, we see that the potential
is in fact quite deep. already at this level it is about 95% of the mass of the d-brane.

at level six the potential includes the level four interactions plus additional terms:

solving the equations of motion that follows from the total level six potential f (6), one
nds that the location of tc is shifted slightly (tc  0.544, uc  0.190, vc  0.202) with
f (tc)  0.959. by including two modes in addition to the tachyon we have gone from
68% to 96% of the expected vacuum energy! this is certainly encouraging and leads us
to believe that the expansion converges rapidly to the expected answer.

approximation with level eight interactions. to establish the convergence beyond reason-
able doubt, we now undertake the substantially more involved calculation of the potential

to level eight. for this we need to include all the level four elds. a general tachyon
eld conguration in the feynman-siegel gauge, including elds up to level four, has the
form:14

|ti = tc1|0i + uc1|0i + v

+al4c1|0i + bl2l2c1|0i + cc3|0i
+db3c1c1|0i + eb2c2c1|0i + f l2c1|0i .

(12)

in order to construct the potential to level eight, we need to substitute (12) into (2), and

evaluate the action keeping terms up to level eight. we use two dierent methods to
compute the cubic interaction vertices. in the rst approach we explicitly compute the
conformal transformation of all the vertex operators associated with the state (12) under
the conformal maps h1, h2 and h3, and compute the three point correlation functions of
the resulting operators. in the second approach we use a representation of the matter

virasoro algebra in terms of 26 free bosonic elds, and use the neumann function method
to compute the three string vertex [23]. both approaches give the same results.

besides the terms given in eqs.(10) and (11) (which we explicitly verify), there are

four dierent kinds of additional terms in the computation of f (8). these are

1. the quadratic term involving the level 4 elds. this is a level 8 contribution to the

potential, and is given by:

the level 8 approximation to the full tachyon potential is obtained by combining the
contributions (10), (11) and (13)-(17):

f (8) = f (6) + f (4) + f (6) + 0f (8) + 1f (8) + 2f (8) .

(18)

given this potential we can search for a stationary point of the potential.15 we nd

that the equations of motion following from this potential are satised for16:

tc = 0.5482,

uc = 0.2043,

vc = 0.2045, ac = 0.00495, bc = 0.00056,

cc = 0.0549, dc = 0.0183, ec = 0.0317, fc = 0.0066 .

the value of the potential at this stationary point is given by

f (tc) = 0.9864 .

(19)

(20)

this is about 1% away from the expected answer 1. note the near equality of the values
of uc and vc. we suspect this to be an exact equality in the complete answer. this, in
turn, indicates that there might be a closed form expression for the state |tci describing
the stationary point, since otherwise it will be very dicult to explain the equality of
these coecients.

discussion. we shall end this paper by discussing the signicance of our results and some

further investigations which these results suggest.

1. our result indicates that the tachyonic vacuum of the bosonic d-brane, representing

its annihilation, is described by a string eld dominated by the low lying modes of
the theory. this is certainly surprising since total brane disappearance is a highly

non-perturbative phenomenon and one could have expected non-trivial participation
of all the higher string modes. as we saw, however, condensation of states up to
level four account for 99% of the potential energy required to cancel the tension of

the d-brane. our results show that string eld theory captures non-perturbative
string dynamics. the string eld |tc > appears to be well-dened.

15the actual computations require use of symbolic manipulation programs maple and mathematica.
16this stationary point is closest to the one given earlier for level four and level six potentials, in
the sense that if we look for a numerical solution with the stationary point of the level four or level
six potential as the starting point, we arrive at the solution (19). there may be other solutions to the
equations of motion whose interpretation is not clear.

9

2. associated with the phenomenon of tachyon condensation on the d-brane is the
problem of the extra u(1) gauge eld [24, 6, 25]. how does the u(1) gauge eld

living on the brane disappear after the tachyon condenses and the brane annihilates?
since the tachyon is neutral, the gauge eld cannot acquire mass via the higgs
mechanism. also, how do open strings with one endpoint lying on the d-brane in

question disappear after tachyon condensation?

ref.[26] proposed that at the extrema t = tc, the action of the gauge eld vanishes
identically. this explains the absence of a dynamical gauge eld.
in addition,

the path integral over the gauge eld now sets to zero the charged currents, thus
explaining the absence of open strings with one endpoint on the brane in question.

since our analysis shows that the tachyonic vacuum can be studied eciently with

string eld theory, one can ask if the above proposal can also be veried using string
eld theory. in other words, can one study the fate of action involving the gauge
elds at the extremum t = tc and show that its coecient becomes small?

3. according to the conjecture of ref.[1, 2], a d(p1) brane of the bosonic string theory
can be regarded as a lump solution on a dp brane, where far away from the core
of the lump the tachyon condenses to the critical value tc. since the conguration
t = tc seems to have a good description in string eld theory, it is natural to ask
whether the lump also has a good description in string eld theory.

4. another question that arises from our analysis is:

is it possible to write down a
closed form expression for the exact extremum |tci of the tachyon potential, and/or
of the lump solutions describing lower dimensional branes? as we have already
mentioned, the near equality of uc and vc in eq.(19) can be taken as an evidence
that there is a closed form expression for |tci.

5. finally, we can wonder about the existence of a stationary point in the tachyon

potential for the bosonic closed string eld theory [27]. could this vacuum, if it
exists, be a state of unbroken general coordinate invariance having no dynamical

graviton? while there appears to be no physical prediction for such hypothetical
stationary state, the methods discussed here may improve on earlier computations

[15, 16, 17] to give some new insight into this problem.
