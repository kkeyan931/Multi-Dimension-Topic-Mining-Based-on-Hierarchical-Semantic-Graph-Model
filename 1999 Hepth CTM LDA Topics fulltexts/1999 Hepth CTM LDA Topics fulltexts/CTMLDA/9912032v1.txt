abstract

we discuss the role of conformal matter quantum eects (using large n anomaly
induced eective action) to creation-annihilation of an anti-de sitter universe. the
quantum maximally supersymmetric yang-mills theory covariantly coupled with classical
n = 4 conformal supergravity is considered as a typical example of conformal gut. on a
purely gravitational (supersymmetric) ads background, the quantum eects act against
an (already existing) ads universe. the annihilation of such a universe occurs, what is
common for any conformal matter theory. on a dilaton-gravitational background, where
there is dilatonic contribution to the induced eective action, the quantum creation of an
ads universe is possible assuming ne-tuning of the dilaton.

1. there is a large interest now in studies related to anti-de sitter (ads) backgrounds.
this is caused by several reasons. first of all, via the ads/cft correspondence (for a
review,see [1]) investigating the classical iib supergravity on an ads background (after com-
pactication), one can get answers for the dual (boundary) quantum gauge theory. second, the
ads space is extremely symmetric one (maximum number of killing vectors), like minkowski
space. moreover, it is a well-known supersymmetric background for supergravity theories.
for strings the backgrounds with ads section are often suspected to be the exact vacuum
state. third, according to some cosmological data the inationary universe could have the
spatial section with negative curvature. generalizing this for a brane world one can speculate
on the possibility of 4d ads stage (or regions) in the early universe.

the important question is: how should one create the ads regions in the early universe?
the mechanisms of such creation maybe important for the realization of ads black holes
presence.
in this note we investigate the role of matter quantum eects to the anti-de
sitter universe. it is well known that the inationary (de sitter) universe maybe created
completely by quantum eects of conformally invariant matter. on the contrary, as we will
show below, the quantum creation of anti-de sitter universe by quantum eects is rather
unrealistic. the quantum annihilation of such a universe occurs. only in presence of dilaton
the ne-tuning of the dilaton solution may lead to quantum creation of the ads universe (an
example of quantum maximally supersymmetric ym theory conformally coupled to conformal
background supergravity).

2.let us start from one form of the metric describing four-dimensional anti-de sitter

(ads4) spacetime,

ds2 = e2ex3(dt2  (dx1)2  (dx2)2)  (dex3)2 ,

having a negative eective cosmological constant  = 2. one may present this metric in
conformally at form via the transformation

(1)

then

y = x3 =

eex3



.

ds2 = a2(dt2  dx

2) = a2 dxdx ,

(2)

(3)

= 1/(x3) = 1/(y). this form of the metric is often useful in the study of

with a = eex3

quantum gauge theory via the sg dual.

imagine now that the early universe is described by some quantum grand unied theory
(gut) containing ns scalars, nf spinors and nv vectors. the typical example may be
su(n ) n = 4 super yangmills theory, where in the adjoint representation ns = 6(n 2  1),
nf = 2(n 2  1), and nv = n 2  1. non-singular quantum cosmology from this n = 4 super
yangmills (ym) theory, in the presence of a non-trivial dilaton background, was recently
discussed in [2]. unlike to de sitter universe, the ads one is supersymmetric background of
susy theory with supergravity under discussion. note also that quantum elds on negative
curvature space have been reviewed in ref.[3].

the quantum gut under consideration produces the well-known conformal anomaly (for

a review see [4])

t = b(cid:18)f +

2
3

r(cid:19) + b1g + b2 r ,

where b and b1 are constants,

b =

ns + 6nf + 12nv

120(4)2

,

b1 = 

ns + 11nf + 62nv

360(4)2

,

while f is the square of the weyl tensor,

f = rr  2r r +

1
3

r2 ,

(4)

(5)

(6)

and g is the gaussbonnet invariant. note that the constant b2 is known to be in general
ambiguous, as it may be changed by a nite renormalization of the gravitational action. in
the following we put b2 = 0, since this does not inuence the physical consequences.

using the above conformal anomaly one can easily calculate the anomaly-induced eective
action [5]. having in mind the applications for quantum induced ads space we consider a
metric similar to (3), i.e. g = e2(y) , where  is the minkowski metric. then the
techniques of ref. [5] may easily be applied, and the following anomaly-induced eective
action is obtained,

w =z d4xh2b12  2(b + b1)( +  ()( ))2i .

(7)

2

since  is assumed to depend only on y, this expression may be simplied:

w = v3z dyh2b1  2(b + b1)( + ()2)2i .

(8)

here  = d/dy. formally, this expression coincides with the eective action on a time
dependent conformally at background, but its physics is of course dierent. one should
also remember that the total eective action consists of w plus some conformally invariant
functional. in the case of a conformally at background, as considered here, this conformally
invariant functional is a non-essential constant. only if one considers periodicity on some
of the coordinates (say, ads bh) will this constant become more important, as a kind of
casimir energy, since it will depend on the radius of the compact dimension.

in order to take into account the quantum matter eects in the ads universe we should

add the anomaly-induced action to the classical gravitational action

scl = 

1

z d4xg (r + 6) = 

1

z d4x e4(6e2(()2 + ()) + 6) .

(9)

the sum of classical action and quantum eective action describes the dynamics of whole
quantum system.

equations of motion following from the action scl + w are

here prime means derivative with respect to y. one may now look for the special ads-like
solutions of eq. (10): a = c/y. when there are no quantum corrections, there is a solution

4b(cid:16)12a  24a3(cid:17) = 0 .

with c = 1/, in accordance with the ads metric. when the eective cosmological

constant  = 0, eq. (10) reduces to c2 = b1 (at a(y) = c/y). however, c2 = b1 leads to
an imaginary scale factor a, because b1 < 0. this indicates that matter corrections alone can
not create an anti-de sitter universe. this is in contrast to the possibility of creation of a
de sitter universe by solely matter quantum eects [10]. indeed, when scale factor depends
only on time the sign of curvature (which is positive) is changing. as a result, a = c/ with
c2 = b1.
in other words, there is always a solution - in form of a quantum created de
sitter universe! on the contrary, the presence of a negative eective cosmological constant
in classical theory is a necessary condition for the existence of an anti-de sitter universe, at
least within our scenario.

in the general case, the algebraic equation for c2 becomes (assuming  < 0):

(11)

(12)

(13)

and it has the solutions:

2(cid:16)1 p1 + 4b1(cid:17) .

the rst solution corresponds to the quantum corrected anti-de sitter universe. here, start-
ing from some bare (even very small!) negative cosmological constant, we get an anti-de

sitter universe with a smaller cosmological constant due to quantum corrections. the quan-
tum corrections act against the existing anti-de sitter universe and make it less stable. this
is the mechanism of annihilation of anti-de sitter universe.

the second solution corresponds to the imaginary scale factor since it has c2 < 0.
the complete eective action on the solution a(y) = c/y is

scl + w = v3z dy

(14)

the dependence of eective action from c2 is seen.

thus, we have shown that quantum corrections in an already existing anti-de sitter
universe make it less stable, whereas creation of an anti-de sitter universe by quantum
corrections alone is impossible. this is in contrast to the de sitter universe, which may be
created by quantum corrections alone. it is now interesting to understand the role of other
eects in our scenario. as such we consider the presence of dilaton. the related dilatonic
terms in action may play the role of eective cosmological constant.

3. let us start from n = 4 su(n ) super ym theory conformally coupled with the
background n = 4 conformal supergravity (see [6] for an introduction). the corresponding
vector multiplet is (a, i, xij). there is also complex scalar (axion and dilaton) in conformal
supergravity multiplet.

the calculation of the conformal anomaly for this super ym theory has been done in refs.
[7] via the ads/cft correspondence (for a review, see [1]). the result coincides with that
of ref. [8], where it was suggested that the conformal anomaly of n = 4 su(n ) super ym
theory coincides with the action of n = 4 conformal supergravity.
r(cid:19) + b1g + b2r + c(cid:20)  2(cid:18)r 

g r(cid:19)  (cid:21).

on the purely bosonic background one gets:

t = b(cid:18)f +

1
3

3

the last term, with the constant

c =

n 2  1
(4)2

,

is the contribution of dilaton and axion elds.

using the conformal anomaly (15), and following ref. [2], it is again not dicult to con-
struct the anomaly-induced eective action w on the conformally at background, g =
e2 .

with  and  depending only on time, one gets, in terms of the conformal time  [2],

w = v3z dh2b1  2(b + b1)( + ()2) + c re()i,

where v3 is three-dimensional volume, and  = d/d. as usual, the complete eective
action is the sum of two terms: w and some conformally invariant functional w1. since we
discuss a conformally at background, w1 can only depend on the complex scalar , and
has to be constant when  is constant. supposing that w1 is a local functional (so that the
schwingerde witt expansion may be used), we are left with only one possibility,

(15)

(16)

w1 = v3z d re() ln 2 .

4

(17)

the coecient of w1 depends on the regularization used, since it may be absorbed into the
scale , by a redenition. thus our quantum correction to the classical action is  = w + w1.

the usual choice for the complex scalar  is

 =  + ie ,

(18)

where  is the dilaton, and  is the r-r scalar (axion) of type iib supergravity (or conformal
supergravity, as above).

thus, the nal expression for the one-loop eective action of n = 4 super yangmills

theory coupled to conformal supergravity on a conformally at background is

 = v3z dh2b1  2(b + b1)( + ()2) + (c + a) re()i ,

(19)

where a is some constant depending on regularization, and  =  + ie. one may consider
the case of large n , then in the large n expansion the proper quantum gravity corrections
to  will be of next-to-leading order.

there are dierent choices for the classical gravitational action. for example, one can
consider the axion-dilatonic gravity by gibbonsgreenperry [9], which describes the bosonic
sector of type iib supergravity,

scl = 

1

z d4xg (cid:18)r +

1
2

g   +

1
2

e2 g  (cid:19) .

(20)

in the absence of the dilaton and axion, this reduces to the standard action of general rel-
ativity. using the above choice of a conformally at metric one may simplify eq. (20) as
follows,

scl = 

1


v3z d(cid:18)6e2 (()2 + ()) +

1
2

e2 ()2 +

1
2

e2+2 ()2(cid:19) .

(21)

now it is convenient to transform to cosmological time t, such that dt = a() d = e() d.

the equations of motion may be obtained by variations with respect to a,  and .

we will consider the simpler choice when the axion is equal to zero, and the kinetic term for
the dilaton in the classical action is absent. the regularization where a = 0 is also chosen.
as a result one comes to the model discussed in ref.[2]. the study of the corresponding
eective equations for time-dependent conformally at metric has been done in above work.
the possibility of quantum creation of de sitter universe has been proved. one can give now
an analysis related to a quantum corrected anti-de sitter universe in the same way as it was
done in previous section. note, however, that in the case under discussion there is no classical
cosmological constant and as a result there is no anti-de sitter solution on the classical level.

the eective equations of motion take the form:

a

 = 0 ,

ln a  + (ln a ) = 0 .

(22)

here prime means derivative on y and we put  = .

motivated by ref. [2] one can make now the following transformation:

dz = a(y) dy .

5

(23)

then, in terms of the variable z the rst of equations (22) is:

a2 ....

a +3a a

...

a +aa2 (cid:18)5 +

6b1

b (cid:19) a2a +

3

b(cid:16)a2a + a a2(cid:17) 

c y [, a]

4b

= 0 .

(24)

here a = da/dz, y [, a] is given in ref. [2], and the second equation (22) (in terms of z) is
also given in ref. [2] (eq. (10)). the only dierence from the analysis done there, is that the
sign of the 1/ term is reversed. then, as in ref. [2] we search for special solutions

a(z)  a0 ehz ,

(z)  0 ehz ,

(25)

analyzing the second of equations (22) (in terms of z) and dropping logarithmic term in it
(same arguments as in ref. [2] may be given) one comes to the same solution:

(z) = 1 e

3

2 hz + 2 e2.62 hz + 3 e0.38 hz ,

(26)

where 1, 2, 3 are constants. substituting the particular solution (z) = 0 ehz in
eq. (24) one obtains:

h 2 

1

(cid:20)b1 +

c
24

0

2(cid:16)4  63 + 112  6(cid:17)(cid:21)1

.

(27)

the rst term in the denominator is always negative, while the second term may be positive
2 hz (i.e.
only at  = 3/2. then, it is only with the special dilaton solution (z) = 1 e
2 > 12 one gets the positive h 2 and, hence, non-
2 = 3 = 0) and at the condition 1
imaginary scale factor for ads universe. thus, there occurs the possibility for quantum
creation of dilatonic ads universe, but it requires a strong ne-tuning of the dilatonic solution.
this is, of course, a very non-realistic situation. note that the corresponding ads scale factor
is:

3

a(y) = 

1
hy

.

(28)

one can analyze the eqs. (22) numerically with the same qualitative result; for some very
special initial conditions for dilaton and scale factor the quantum creation of ads universe
is possible. however, in most cases such a process does not occur.

thus, we demonstrated that quantum eects of conformal matter do not support the
creation of an ads universe. moreover, an already existing classical ads universe is annihi-
lating due to quantum eects. only for dilaton-gravitational background (maximally susy
ym theory) where there is dilatonic contribution to conformal anomaly and to induced ef-
fective action the quantum eects may create ads universe subject to strong ne-tuning.
however, the probability of such creation is much less than the same process for de sitter
universe at similar conditions.

the model under discussion maybe understood also as a simplied model for creation-
annihilation of ads black hole. taking additional contribution to eective action due to
geometrical structure of ads bh one can repeat this analysis for a more realistic situation.
unfortunately, this additional piece of eective action is not known in closed form. from
another side, the inclusion of non-trivial axion maybe also done. however, in such case only
numerical analysis of equations of motion is possible.
