abstract. we study the behavior of bound energy levels for the case of two classical interact-
ing elds  and  in a nite domain (box) in (1 + 1) dimension on which we impose dirichlet
4 4 self-interaction and an in-
boundary conditions (dbc). the total lagrangian contain a 
teraction term given by g22. we calculate the energy eigenfunctions and its correspondent
eigenvalues and study their dependence on the size of the box (l) as well on the free parameters
of the lagrangian: mass ratio  = m 2
, and interaction coupling constants  and g. we show

m 2

that for some congurations of the above parameters, there exists critical sizes of the box for
which instability points of the eld  appear.

1. introduction

it is well known that quantum physical systems can alter signicantly their behavior when

placed inside cavities. a modern paradigm is the famous casimir eect [1] and more recently

the so called cavity quantum electrodynamics [2].

from a mathematical point of view part of these studies can be translated into the general

setting of dierential equations for quantum elds, on which are imposed suitable boundary

conditions, in order to know wavefunctions and energy eigenvalues. the above mentioned

subjects are essentially of quantum nature. nevertheless it is well known that, for several

applications, quantum elds can be thought as classical elds on which are added quantum

corrections [3]. in this sense, although at a classical level, we can get a lot of information about

the system under study.

in this work we study the inuence of boundary conditions on bound energy levels of a

classical system of elds described by lagrangian density

l =

where , g are coupling constants.

before to continue, we want to make an important observation.

in (1), the lagrangian
density of the eld , i.e. l = 1
2, does not have a state of least energy since
its associated hamiltonian is not positive denite. this, clearly, is due to the wrong sign

2()2 + 1

2 m 2

of the mass term. one way of to solve this would be by adding a term of self-interaction for

the eld , as usually happens in theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking. of course we

could also keep the original positive sign in the mass term. this will lead to dierent results

from this work, but all tecniques are all the same. in this work, we chose to keep the positive
sign of the mass term and verify when the interaction term of the lagrangian, given by g2 2,
leads to a lower bound to the hamiltonian density. see appendix for details.

we consider only the simpler case of elds  and  inside a nite box (interval) in (1 + 1)

dimension. of course all discussion can be generalized to higher dimensions with a number of

new dierentials equations and boundary conditions related to geometry of the box. a quantum

version of the theory, in a semiclassical approach will be done elsewhere.

the equation of motion (e.o.m.) for the two elds are given by

  + m 2

  2 g2 = 0,

  + m 2

  3 = 0.

2

(2)

(3)

in eq.(3) we have neglected the term 2 g2 which can be interpreted as the back-reaction of
eld  on the mass term of . this can be achieved if we impose for example that || << m
2 g .
of course other regimes can be studied from eq. (3) by adopting dierent approximations.

in a previous work [4] we have studied, in (1 + 1) dimension, the case in which the eld

(x), unlike (x), is not inuenced by nite boundary conditions of the box. so (x) is the
kink solution of eq. (3) in (, +) [5]. in this case we can think -eld is placed in a xed
potential 2 and we showed that a level splitting appears (bifurcation point). this could be
interpreted, in a semi-classical version of the theory, as -particle creation induced by squeezing

the box below a critical size.

in this work we take into account the same boundary conditions for both elds  and .
this means that the potential 2 depends on the size of the box. so we study the behavior
of the energy levels of  eld by running the parameters l, , , g, where  = m 2
is the mass

m 2

ratio and l is the box size. of course, the box size is an external parameter of the theory. we

show below that classical instabilities appear for a critical size of box.

a family of static solutions of the classsical equation of motion to the eld (x) are given

by sn-type elliptic functions [6]

c(x) = 

m2c

q1 + 1  2c

sn  mx

2 q1 + 1  2c, l! ,

where c is a parameter belonging to interval (0, 1

2 ] and

l =

1

1 + 1+12c

c

.

(4)

(5)

clearly, l  (0, 1]. there exist another family of solutions. see reference [6] for details. the
above one was chosen because we can impose dirichlet boundary conditions on their solutions.
in general c is a function of x  x0, but we can put x0 = 0 without loss of generality.

so, the equation of motion for the eld  can be written as

  + m 2
 

4 g m 2
c

(1 + 1  2c)

sn2  mx

2 q1 + 1  2c, l!!  = 0.

since we are interested in stationary solutions we can write (x, t) = ei t(x), where 

are energy eigenvalues. with this, the previous equation we can be writen in the form

d2

(x) + m 2

, l. for short   (, g, ; l),

where the semicolon means l is an external parameter of the theory. in section 5 we study the

level shifts induced by changing the box size and interpret the results. in section 6 we conclude

with some comments and list some topics for future work.

2. lame equation and boundary conditions

in this section we study the bound levels of two interacting elds which are conned inside

a box (interval in our case) of length l. we impose dirichlet boundary conditions (dbc) for

both elds  and  (or ).

in [6] the authors showed that imposing dbc on the eld , given by (4), conned to a box

of size l, it must satisfy the condition

ml = 41 + l k(l),

(7)

where 4k(l) is a period of the jacobi elliptic functions sn(u, l) [7]. to get the above equation
we impose (dbc) at x1 =  l
2 . observe that since the solutions (4) are odd
functions, the points x0 = 0 does not give any information and it is sucient to impose dbc
just, say, at x2 = l
2 .

2 and x2 = l

since we take the same boundary conditions for both elds (same kind of connement), this

implies that the same l = l(l) obtained from the above equation must be substituted in the

-eld boundary conditions, in order to nd its energy eigenvalues.

of course dierent boundary conditions can be imposed independently on the elds  and .

for example, in our previous work [4] we have studied the extreme case that the box boundaries

are transparent for the eld , while  satises dbc.

we start making the changes of variables,

 =

mx

2 q1 + 1  2c

and

2 =

(e  2)

m 2
,

in equation (6) which can then be rewritten as

d2
d2

() = 


8 g c

(1 + 1  2c)2

sn2(, l)  2

on the other hand, from (5) we have

)

q1 + 1  2c 

m 2

e

(1 + 1  2c)

 ().

c =

(l + 1)2

.

thus (8) reduces to

(8)

(9)

(10)

this dierential equation has some important special properties. since g and  are positive

we can write, without lost of generality

4

g
  n(n + 1),

where n is a positive real number.

so, the above equation can be rewritten as

d2
d2

() =  n(n + 1)l sn2(, l)  (  1)(1 + l) 

e(1 + l)

2

! (),

(11)

(12)

where we have dened the adimensional mass ratio parameter as   m 2


m 2


.

this is a generalized lame dierential equation. in the literature the general form of this

type of equation is given by [8]1

d2

d2 () = (cid:16)n(n + 1) k sn2(, k) + c(cid:17) (),

(13)

where n is a positive real number, k is the parameter of the jacobian elliptic function sn, and

c is an arbitrary constant.

it is well known that lame dierential equation and more generally the hills equation

presents stability as well instability bands in the plane of parameters (k, c) in the notation

of equation (13). this stability is related to the spatial dependence of the solution. on the

other hand, we are interested in stability for the time dependence. using floquets theory the

solution can be written as

(x, t) = ei teirxp(x),

where p(x) is a periodic function. in our approach below (section 3) we show that even in the
case for eigenvalues of lame equation describing stable solutions for the spatial part (r2 > 0),
we can have unstable solutions in time, that is 2 < 0.

comparing (12) with (13), we obtain

c = (  1)(1 + l) 

e(1 + l)

2

and

k = l.

for the purpose we have in mind we only consider in this work the case that n is a positive

integer. the case with n real, although more interesting, leads to eigenvalues which are dicult

to calcule exactly and a full numerical treatment is necessary in order to obtain the eigenvalues

we are interested to. for n integer the equation (12) or (13) is called simply lame dierential

1in our notation we take the parameter of the jacobian elliptic function as k (with k > 0) instead of k2 as

in reference [8].

equation and can be solved analitically. so, our results can be used also as a test for the

numerical solutions of more realistic cases which do not have exact solutions.

for n a positive integer the general solution of eq.(12) is given by

() = a em

n () + b f m

n (),

where a and b are arbitrary constants and em
n () are lame functions of the
rst and second kind respectively [8]. the parameter m ranges on {n,n + 1, ..., n  1, n}.
moreover, when n is a positive integer, if one of the solutions of the lame equation is a

n () and f m

polynomial, then the second solution must be an innite series. the polynomial solution is
given by em

n () and the series solution by f m

n () [8].

in this work, we restrict our study only to polynomial solutions. in other words, we search

for solutions whose growth at innite, be polynomial. so our solutions are given only by

() = a em

n ().

(14)

since we are interested only in eigenvalues, in the following we drop the arbitrary constant

from the eigenfunctions (14).

below we show the rst eigenfunctions (n = 1, 2, 3) of eq. (12) which are given by lame

functions. the case for n continuous will not considered in this work. observe that the case

n = 0, in principle, could be considered. but from (11), n = 0 implies g = 0 which in turn leads

to a hamiltonian which is not positive denite. therefore the case n = 0 will be discarded.
of course by eq. (11) there is a minimal strengh for the coupling constant namely, g = 
2
(for n = 1). on the other hand, strong coupling (n  ) leads to a new and more complicated
lame functions. in this work we analyse only the case for n small, that is, the coupling constant

has a moderate strengh. we will see that, yet for these few cases a rich phenomenology for the

bound energy levels emerges.

3. eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of -field

4. eigenvalues for dirichlet boundary conditions

in this section we obtain the energy eigenvalues 2 by imposing dbc at x =  l

2 on the
solutions s above. thus we obtain relations as l  l(l). we have made use of the relation
2 = (e2)

2 m 2
.

an important observation is now in order. in [6] was determined a minimum value for the
relation ml, when l  0, namely, 2. using (7) (the same as (34) below), this result can be
checked easily. likewise observe from (9) that if l  0 then c  0 and then by (4) we have
that   0. so, below the minimum value ml = 2 the eld  vanishes. therefore, in our
calculation the only consistent eigenvalues are those that satisfy the condition ml  2, that
is, those for which the eld  does not vanish. this argument will be used in several cases

below. we now turn to the calculation of the energy eigenvalues for the eigenfunctions s.

case i: n = 1 (g = 
2 )

1) 2

1() = (1  )m 2
.

(30)

observe that in this case 2

1 does not depend on l.

where l satises

2) 2

2(l, ) = (

1
1 + l  )m 2
,

ml = 21 + lk(l).

9

note that the l = l(l) solution of this equation is not the same to that one from (7). as

previously mentioned, we are interested to obtain energy eigenvalues of eld  with the same
l = l(l) used for eld . thus 2

2 must be discarded for the case n = 1.

3) 2

3(l, ) = (

l

1 + l  )m 2
,

sn2(

ml
21 + l

, l) =

1
l

.

(31)

(32)

, l)  1, l should satises l  1. since l  (0, 1], only l = 1 (l = ) is

where l satises

since sn2( ml

solution of the eq. (32).

case ii: n = 2 (g = 3

2 )

where l satises

or

1) 2

1(l, ) = (

4 + l
1 + l  )m 2
,

ml = 41 + lk(l)

ml = 21 + lk(l).

(33)

(34)

(35)

notice, that in this case only the eq. (34) satises the condition that the same l = l(l)

must be used for both elds  and . according to this, solutions of equations like (35) must
be discarded. so 2

1 is an allowed eigenvalue with l given by (34).

with l satises (34) or also

2(l, ) = (

sn2(

l

.

(36)

(37)

here as in the case of the eq. (32), only l = 1 (l = ) is solution of this equation. so 2

2

is also an allowed eigenvalue with l given by (34).

3) 2

3() = (1  )m 2

(38)

observe that 2

3 is independent of l and therefore of l.

4) 2

where l satises

, l) =

1

.

(39)

(40)

a numerical analysis shows that for l  (0, 1] we obtain, from the above equation that the
4 is not a consistent

values of ml belongs to the interval (1.57, 1.86). so, the eigenvalue 2
solution since for this case ml < 2.

5) 2

5(l, ) = (

where l satises

this relation has only the solution, l = 1 (l = ).

case iii: n = 3 (g = 3)

1(l, ) = (

2l + 5 + 2l2  l + 4

1 + l

 )m 2
.

(41)

(42)

(43)

since we have a product in (23) we get or l satisfying eq. (35), which should be discarded,

or l satises

sn2(

ml
2l + 1

, l) =

1

l + 2 + l2  l + 4

.

(44)

a numerical analysis shows that for l  (0, 1] ml belongs to the interval (1.04, 1.36) and

then ml < 2. therefore the eigenvalue 2

6 is not a consistent solution.

2) 2

2(l, ) = (

5l + 2 + 24 l2  l + 1

(45)

, l) =

or

sn2(

ml

, l) =

1

2l + 1 + 4l2  l + 1

.

(46)

11

observe that the rst equation is satised only for l = 1 (l = ), and for the second
equation is possible to show numerically that ml belongs to the interval (1.36, 1.57). thus
this equation will not be considered since ml < 2.

3) 2

3(l, ) = (4  )m 2

3 is independent of l and therefore of l.

in this case 2

4) 2

with l satisfying (34) or

, l) =

3

2l + 2 q4(l  1)2 + l

.

(47)

(48)

(49)

again, in this case only l = 1 (l = ) is solution of (49). so 2

4 is an allowed eigenvalue

with l satisfying (34).

5) 2

5(l, ) = (

2l + 5  2l2  l + 4

,

with l satisfying an equation similar to (35) or

sn2(

ml

, l) =

1

l + 2  l2  l + 4

.

as in the previous case, only l = 1 (l = ) is solution of (51).

6) 2

6(l, ) = (

, l) =

1
l

or

sn2(

ml
2l + 1

, l) =

1

2l + 1  4l2  l + 1

.

(53)

these equations are also satised only for l = 1 (l = ).

7) 2

7(l, ) = (

(5  )(l + 1) + 2q4(l  1)2 + l

with l satisfying (34) or

sn2(

ml
2l + 1

, l) =

3

2l + 2 +q4(l  1)2 + l

.

(55)

by numerical analysis is possible to show that ml belongs to the interval (2.04, 2.92).
7 is an allowed eigenvalue with l

thus these solutions must be discarded since ml < 2. so 2
satisfying (34).

the above study shows that only the eigenvalues 2

2
7 for n = 3. also there is a trivial one, namely 2

4 and
3 for n = 2.
in the next section, we study the behavior of the energy eigenvalues 2, for a xed ,

1 for n = 1 which coincides with 2

1 and 2

2 are allowed for n = 2, 2

running continuously the external parameter of the theory l  l(l).

5. level shifts induced by box size changing and points of

instability

in this section we study the behavior of level shifts under changing of the box size. the case
1, its does not depends on l in a non-trivial

n = 1, although has an allowed level, namely 2
way. so we do not consider it interesting to our study, in this work.

for the cases n = 2 and 3 we have non-trivial results. in all cases below we xed dierent

values for the mass parameter . also we demand classical stability for the eigenfunctions i
(i = 1, 2, 3). classical stability means that the energy eigenvalues 2
i are non-negative [3], so
that the amplitude of eld  does not grow exponentially in time.

it is interesting to note that (see fig. 2) for l = , 1 and 2 converge to q 3

2 m, i.e.,
for large box (l = ) the excited state of dashen-hasslacher-neveu (dhn) [5] is obtained.
likewise the ground state of (dhn) model also is obtained, i.e., 3 = 0. this can be proved
directly from eq. (6) taking l = 1. nevertheless the eq. (6), or its equivalent eq. (12), has an

aditional freedom by varying the parameter .

the fig. 2 shows that for l  0 (ml  2) [6], the energy eigenvalues 2+ and 2

is not the case here, because l  0 implies by eqs. (4) and (5) that  = 0 and we are left only
with a free lagrangian of the  eld and no critical point exists.

observe that 2

3 is negative, so the classical conguration associated to this eigenvalue is
unstable [3] and 2+ turns out the new ground state. in the interval l  (0, 1
2 is negative.
thus its classical conguration is unstable in this interval. also observe that now the instability

2 ) 2

point occurs for a bigger size (not the minimal one) of the box. here ones can ask whether this

kind of instability could lead to a condensate in a quantum regime. a full proof of this, of

course, requires a second quantization for the eld , at least, in a semiclassical aproach. also

it is well known that inclusion of a non-linear term for it in the total lagrangian could lead to

quantum condensates [9]. these lines will not pursued here, since our aim is just to show the

behavior energy levels for elds (in the classical limit) placed inside boxes, for a very simple
geometry like an interval. for l = 1 (ml = ) 1 and 2 coincide at the value 
m  0.7. see

as in previous cases, 2

3 is negative. besides, for l  (0, 1] 2

increasing of the mass parameter  we get an instability point more and more near the critical

we can see from these relations that all the energy eigenvalues are negative (for l 6= 0) and

therefore their classical congurations will be unstable.

it is interesting to note that for   [2, 3] the 2 disappears for   5

2 <  < 3
only 1 survives and it is easy to see from fig. 4 above that its behavior is inverse of that one
of 2.

therefore for n = 2, a changing of the box size induces the appearing of an instability point

for the energy eigenvalues 1 or 2 for   (1, 4).

b) case n = 3 (g = 3)

for the case n = 3 the results are pretty the same to its seven bound energy levels. how-

ever, in this case, only the eigenfunctions given by eqs. (26) and (29) with respective energy

eigenvalues given by eqs. (48) and (54) satisfy the condition (7). the only great dierence is
that there is no instability point for the mass ratio parameter   (4, 6). in fact the instability
points only exists for   (1, 4] or   [6, 9).

another interesting point, as showed in [6], is that imposing periodic boundary conditions
at x =  l
2 on the eld , the same relation (7) is obtained and therefore all results from the
dirichlets case keep valid. also imposing periodic boundary conditions at x =  l
2 on the
solutions s, it is possible to show that for the case n = 2, the eigenfunctions given by eqs.
(19) and (20) lead to the same relation for l  l(l) given by (7). in same way, for the case
n = 3, the eigenfunctions given by eqs. (26) and (29) also lead to (7). therefore all results of

the dirichlet case keep valid for periodic boundary conditions.

6. conclusions

in this work we studied the energy eigenvalues 2 of a classical scalar eld  in (1 + 1)
dimension interacting with another classical scalar eld  through the lagrangian lint = g22,
in a nite domain (box of size l). the energy eigenvalues depend on four parameters, namely,

 (mass ratio parameter), coupling constants  and g, and l (which is connected with the box

size l). we xed the coupling constant g by eq. (11) for an arbitrary  and we studied only

the cases n = 1, 2, 3, which correspond to a moderate strengh interaction constant g related to

. for the more general case of n real a full numerical treatment perhaps is necessary. next,
we discussed the behavior of the energy eigenvalues 2 by xing the parameter  and changing
the external parameter of the theory l  l(l), namely the size of the box.

in the case n = 2 (g = 

2 ), we concluded that the instability points for the energy eigenvalues
1 or 2 occur for   (1, 4). these instability points are obtained as a consequence of squeezing
the box. also, in figs. 2, 3 and 4 it is shown that by varying the mass ratio , while 1 presents
its instability point more and more near the minimal size of the box l = 2
, 2 presents its
m
one more and more far from this value.

for the case n = 3 (g = 3), we have seven bound energy levels. also only two of them

satisfy the dirichlets boundary condition which in turn implies eq. (7). their behavior are

18

pretty the same of n = 2, but the instability points only exists for   (1, 4] or   [6, 9). for
 in interval (4, 6) we get only stable solutions. for periodic boundary conditions all results

obtained with dirichlets boundary conditions keep unchangeable. of course other boundary

conditions can be imposed leading to new behaviors of the energy levels under box squeezing.

several interesting extensions and approaches can be pursued from this work. as stressed

in the introduction, elds placed in cavities lead to new and sometimes unexpected behaviors

of some systems. although our approach is for classical elds it suggests that a quantization of

the system above studied could lead to formation of a kind of condensate just by squeezing

the system in a box. of course this would require at least a semiclassical approach which will

be done elsewhere. a more interesting case would be the inclusion of non-linearities for the

classical eld , which leads to well known condensates for unbound domains [9], but now in

nite domains. also in this case we think a full numerical treatment is needed.

generalization of the above results to n spatial dimensions leads to more complex equations,

not to mention that we have, in this case, an enormous (innite to be sure) variety of geometries

for the shape of the box. nevertheless these kind of calculations for spherical symmetry could

be interesting in order to study for example bound states behavior of matter elds in compact

stars and in reheating theory and in inationary cosmology.

appendix

we show below a sucient condition for that the associate hamiltonian to the la-

grangian (1) be positive denite.

we consider the potencial for the eld , given by:

v () = 

1
2

m 2

2 + g22,

we have

v () = m 2

 + 2g2 = 0   = 0 (critical point).

the second derivate of the potencial v () is given by

 + 2g2.

v () = m 2
19

in order to v () > 0 we must impose that

2 >

m 2

2g

.

(56)

thus the above condition leads to the existence of a state of least energy (vacuum) of the

eld .

on the other hand, the hamiltonian for the eld  is given by

h = 2  l = 2 

1

m 2

from there we have that

h =

which will be positive denite, if the condition (56) is satised.
