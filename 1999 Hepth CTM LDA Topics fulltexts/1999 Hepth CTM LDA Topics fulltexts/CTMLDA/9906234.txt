phenomena eective non-supersymmetric gauge theories including new approach solve hierarchy problem non-supersymmetric conformal gauge theory inter- mediate energy regime {$9903128$}. parallel attempts construct consistent non-supersymmetric four dimensional string vacua. besides seven het- erotic non-supersymmetric ten-dimensional string theories also exist two non- supersymmetric type 0a/b string theories . latter models contain tachy- onic mode renders theory unstable. one way circumvent problem placing enough rr ux background shifts square tachyon mass positive values. approach used  reliably study eective theory d3 branes. another way getting rid tachyon special orientifold {$9811035$}. exist three independent orientifold projections type 0b string theory {, (1)fr, (1)fr}, (1)fr right moving space-time fermion number (1)fr right moving world-sheet fermion number. rst two models still contain bulk tachyon, whereas third, type 0, model tachyon projected out. massless spectrum resulting ten-dimensional non-supersymmetric string theory contains graviton, dilaton, rr 0-form, 2-form self-dual 4-form closed string sector gauge eld adjoint u(32) equipped left-handed
