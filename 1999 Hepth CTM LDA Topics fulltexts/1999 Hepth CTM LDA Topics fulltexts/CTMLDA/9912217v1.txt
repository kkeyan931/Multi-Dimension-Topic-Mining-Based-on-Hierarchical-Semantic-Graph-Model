distances in finite spaces

from noncommutative geometry.

bruno iochum 2, thomas krajewski 3, pierre martinetti 4,

abstract

following the general principles of noncommutative geometry, it is possible to dene a metric

on the space of pure states of the noncommutative algebra generated by the coordinates. this

metric generalizes the usual riemannian one. we investigate some general properties of this

metric in the nite commutative case which corresponds to a metric on a nite set and also

give some examples of computations in both commutative and noncommutative cases.

introduction.

though particle experiments are going further in energy and consequently deeper in the

structure of matter, the geometric structure of space time is still unknown. classical dierential

geometry does not allow to take seriously into account both general relativity and quantum

mechanics since the latest renounces intuitive geometric concepts while the rst grounds its
decription of gravitation on purely geometric concepts. noncommutative dierential geometry1

gives a mathematical framework for a geometric understanding of fundamental interactions.

saying geometric understanding, one would like to say clearer understanding: for instance the
noncommutative standard model2,3,4 gives a geometric interpretation of the higgs eld together

with an estimation on the mass of the corresponding boson.

but it is still dicult to draw an intuitive picture of a noncommutative space, as one can
do for an euclidean or even riemannian space. a noncommutative space is described by a c-
algebra a, a faithful representation of a over a hilbert space h, and an operator d acting
on h. d has a compact resolvant and is possibly unbounded. to be precise, the algebra is
restricted to the norm closure of the set of elements a  a such that [d, (a)] is bounded.

a distance is then dened on s(a), state space of a, by

d(, ) = sup

aa {|(a)  (a)| / k[d, a]k  1},  ,   s(a).

(1)

if a is commutative, pures states correspond to characters. thanks to gelfand construction,
they are interpreted as points, and a is the algebra of functions over these points. when a is
not commutative, this interpetation is no more possible but the distance formula between pure

states remains unchanged.

there is not always a clear physical interpretation of this distance. when a is the algebra of
smooth functions over a riemannian spin manifold, h the space of l2-spinors and d the classical
dirac operator, then the noncommutative distance coincides with the geodesic distance. when
a is tensorised by an internal algebra, for instance the diagonal 2x2 matrices, then one obtains
a space of two sheets with geodesic distance over each of them. noncommutative distances
have been considered5,6,7 in the case of nite algebras. moreover, the classical distance in one
dimensional lattices can be obtained via the noncommutative approach8,9.

in refs. 10,11, the problem is introduced in a general framework:

let l be a lipschitz

seminorm on a partially ordered real vector space a. l determines a metric l in the state
space s(a):

l(, ) = sup

aa {|(a)  (a)| / l(a)  1} with ,   s(a).

2

l determines a lipschitz seminorm ll over the space af [s(a)] of ane functions on s(a):

ll(f ) = sup

,s(a){|f ()  f ()|

(, )

/ 6= } with f  af [s(a)].

as a is isomorphic to a dense subspace of af [s(a)], the question is: under which conditions
one has ll = l ? answers are given in ref. 11. in the noncommutative framework, taking
l(a) = k[d, a]k, the question becomes: how to characterize the metrics  coming from a dirac
operator ?

in this paper, we carry out the calculation of distances in spaces associated to nite di-

mensional algebras. it seems natural to restrict to nite dimensional representation of these

algebras since, in the noncommutative approach of the standard model, the internal space is the

space of fermions (more mathematical arguments to avoid innite representations of nite di-
mensional algebras can be found in ref. 12). therefore, a is a direct sum of k matrix algebras,
since any involutive algebra over c which admits a faithful nite dimensional representation in

a hilbert space is a direct sum of matrix algebras. for k = 1, the simpliest interesting case is
a = m2(c). the associated space is a ber space whose base has only one point and the ber
is c2. for k = 2, we study the noncommutative space associated to a = mp(c)  c, p  n.
this is a two point space with ber cp over one of the point. some applications can be found
in ref. 13, where a = m2(c)  c is used to build a rst model of quantized spacetime.

for k  3, we restrict to commutative algebras. then a = ck and s(a) is simply a set of
k points. we choose h = ck. for the three point space with any real selfadjoint operator d
and the n point space with some particular operators d, we explicitly compute distances. to

nd a dirac which gives a desired metric, it is enough to inverse formula. this is not possible

in the four point case for we show that generic distances are roots of polynomials which cannot

be solved by radicals. a possible solution consists in modifying our denition of commutative
spaces. using a slightly more complicated representation of a over a space h larger than
h, one shows that there always exists an operator d giving the desired distances. moreover
(a,h, d) is a real spectral triple which fullls all the axioms of noncommutative geometry.

ii general result and notations.

all along this paper, a is a unital c-algebra represented in a hilbert space h. d is a
selfadjoint operator on h which does not belong to the commutant of a. its components are
dij, 1  i, j  n. s(a) is the set of pure states of a. the distance associated to the triplet
(a,h, d) by (1) is denoted by d.

lemma 1. let a+ be the subset of positive elements of a, and ,   s(a).

d(, ) = sup

aa+ {|(a)  (a)| / k[d, a]k = 1}.

proof. let 

.
= arg ((  )(a0)) where a0  a reaches the supremum in (1), namely:

k[d, a0]k  1 and |(  )(a0)| = dist(, ).

the supremum is also reached for the selfadjoint element b0 = 1

2(a0ei + a0ei)  a since

k[d, b0]k  k[d,a0]k
|(  )(b0)| = | dist(,)

2

2 + k[d,a
0]k
2  1,
+ dist(,)

2

| = dist(, ).

the same is true for c0 = b0 + kb0ki  a+, so we restrict to a+.

suppose now k[d, c0]k < 1. take e0

.
= c0

k[d,c0]k  a+, then

k[d, e0]k = 1

and

|(e0)  (e0)| = |(c0)  (c0)|

k[d, c0]k

> |(c0)  (c0)|,

which is impossible since c0 is chosen to reach the supremum. so k[d, c0]k = 1.

if the supremum is not reached, the proof uses a sequence {an} of elements of a.(cid:4)

 once for all, any element a  a that appears in a proof is selfadjoint.
 the canonical basis of cn ( or rn in case) is denoted by |1i,|2i, ...,|ni.
 when a = mn(c), a pure state  is determined by a normalized vector   cn : (a) =
a , a  mn(c). two normalized vectors determine the same pure state if and only if they
are equal up to a phase. in other terms, s(mn(c)) = cp n1.

 for any unitary operator u of h, the jauge transformed of  is (a)

.
= (uau1),

.
= u1du, then d d( , ) = dd(, ) for

a  a. if d
aa(cid:8)|(  )(a)| /ku1du, a]k = 1(cid:9) = sup
sup

u au 1a(cid:8)|(  )(uau1)| /k[d, uau1]k = 1(cid:9) .

iii one point space.

the rst non trivial example with a single matrix algebra is a = m2(c), represented in
a21 a22 (cid:19). d is a 2  2 selfadjoint matrix with two real and distinct
h = c2 by a  a = (cid:18) a11 a12
eigenvalues d1, d2. s(a) = cp 1 is isomorphic to the sphere s2. an explicit one to one
correspondence is the hopf bration14:  = (1, 2)  cp 1 is associated to (a, b, c)  s2 by

in a one point space with a ber of higher dimension than c2, one needs an explicit formula

pure states can be interpreted as points of a n point space whose function algebra is a: a(i)
the distance between two points i, j of this nite space is

d(i, j) = sup

aa+ {|ai  aj| / k[d, a]k = 1}.

.
= ai.

(6)

in nite spaces, d may be interpreted as the adjacency matrix of a lattice6: two points i
and j are connected if and only if dij 6= 0. for instance, in the four point space, the restriction
to d13 = d24 = 0 corresponds to a cyclic graph:

a path ij is a sequence of p distinct points (i, i2, ..., ip1, j) with dikik+1 6= 0, k  {1, p1}.

in a two point space, the length of ij is by denition

since d(1, 2) = 1

|dikik+1|

.

two points i,j are said connected if there exists at least one path ij. the geodesic distance

lij is by denition the length of the shortest path connecting i and j.

proposition 4.

i) let d be the operator obtained by cancelling one or several lines and the corresponding

columns of d. then dd  dd.

ii) the distance between two points i and j depends only on the matrix elements correspond-

ing to points situated on a path joining i and j.

iii) the distance between two points is nite if and only if they are connected.

proof.
i) let dene e  a by ei = 0 if the ith line and column are cancelled, ei = 1 elsewhere. e is

a projection, commuting with a, and d = ede. thus ||[d, a]||  ||[d, a]||,a  a. so

sup{|ai  aj| /k[d, a]k  1}  sup{|ai  aj| /k[d, a]k  1}.

ii) let ij denote the graph associated to the set of points belonging to any path ij, and

iij the set of points which are not on any path ij. any point of iij is connected by at most

8

one path to ij. in other terms, l  iij there is at most one point ml  ij such that l and ml
are connected and lml has all its points (except ml) in iij.

let d be the operator obtained by cancellation of all lines and columns associated to points
of iij. assume that the supremum in (6) with d is reached by a  a = cn. consider a  cn
such that ap = ap except for the points of iij for which al = aml or al = 0 if ml does not exist.
then ||[d, a]|| = ||[d, a]||, so dd(i, j)  dd(i, j). by i ), dd(i, j)  dd(i, j). hence the result.

iii) suppose i and j are connected. there is at least one path ij = (i, i2, ..., ip1, j) whose
length is the geodesic distance lij. let obtain d by cancelling all lines and columns which do
not correspond to points of ij. then d(i, j)  dd(i, j). by the triangular inequality, one has

d(i, j) is smaller than the geodesic distance, thus it is nite.

if i and j are not connected, dene a  cn by ai = t > 0, ak = ai if k and i are connected,

ak = 0 otherwise. then [d, a] = 0 and |ai  aj| = t. as t is arbitrary, d(i, j) is innite. (cid:4)

vi distance on a regular space.

a n point commutative space is called regular when all coecients of operator d are equal:

d = {dij} = {k(1  ij)} , k  r.

d(i1, i2) =

|k|r 2
n  2

.

proof. in the regular space, the problem is symmetrical: all distances are equal and we
compute d(1, 2). when a link is cut, we take i1 = 1, i2 = 2 to x notations, and denote by d

the operator d with d12 = 0 . in both case, (6) and (7) yield

d(1, 2) = sup

aa+{ |x| /k[ d or d, a]k = 1}.

we rst compute the norm of the commutator, and then nd the supremum.

according to this proposition, the distance is a common root of a polynomial in several

variables and its various derivatives. before undertaking explicit calculations, we recall general

16

results about polynomial systems.

notes on systems of polynomial equations.

let p and q be two polynomials of the form

p (x) = anxn + an1xn1 + ... + a0
q(x) = bmxm + bm1xm1 + ... + b0.

with an, bm 6= 0. without calculating the roots pi, qj of p , q, one nds by algebraic manipulations16
of the coecients ai and bj the resultant of p and q:

res(p, q)

.
= am

n bn

m 
i,j

(pi  qj),

1  i  n, 1  j  m.

(17)

res(p, q) is a polynomial in the ais and bjs. p and q have a common root if and only if their

resultant is zero. a particular resultant is the discriminant:

dis(p )

.
= res(p, p ).

p has a double root if and only if dis(p ) = 0. if p and q are polynomials in x, y, z, then

res[p, q, y] denotes the resultant of p and q seen as polynomials in y. equivalently dis[p, z]

stands for discriminant of p seen as a polynomial in z.

proposition 12. let p (x, y, z) be a polynomial of degree 2 in z, whose coecients are real
functions of x and y. if p (x0, y0, z0) = p
z (x0, y0, z0) = 0 for some (x0, y0, z0) 
r3, then x0 is a root of the polynomial dis[dis(p, z), y], and y0 is a double root of the polynomial

y (x0, y0, z0) = p

dis(p, z)(x0, y).

y (x0, y0) = 0 = v (x0, y0), thus y0 is a double

root of v (x0, y) and

dis(v, y)(x0) = dis[dis[p, z], y](x0) = 0. (cid:4)

proof of theorem 9. proposition 11 and 12 yields

d(1, 2)  {x / dis[v (x, y), y] = 0} with v (x, y) = dis[f (x, y, z), z].
n bn

instead of v (x, y), one uses the eective form without the correctif term am

with fn the leading coecient of f seen as a polynomial in z and n = deg(f ). note that the

numerator is taken after a possible (but not always possible) simplication of the fraction.

i) by direct computation, vef f (x, y) = vi yi, 0  i  4. exact expressions of the vis are

given in appendix. they are polynomial in x of the form:

v4(x) = v40, v3(x) = v31x, v2(x) = v22x2 + v20, v1(x) = v13x3 + v11x, v0(x) = v04x4 + v02x2 + v00.

ii) we compute an explicit counterexample: assume d1 = d2 = d3 = d4 = d6 = 1 and 1
d5

= 0.

then

f (x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + z2 + (x  y)2 + (y  z)2  (x(y  z) + z(x  y))2.
it is a polynomial of degree 2 in the variables x, y and z. direct computation gives

vef f (x, y) = 2  6 y2 + 3 y4 + 4 x2 (cid:0)1 + y2(cid:1)  4 x y (cid:0)1 + y2(cid:1) ,
dis(vef f , y) = 768 (cid:0)54  54 x2 + 135 x4 + 296 x6  368 x8 + 128 x10(cid:1) .

18

let p(x) = 128x5 + 368x4  296x3  135x2 + 54x + 54. p has one real root x1, two distinct
complex ones x2 & x4 and their conjugates x3 & x5. galois theory showes that p is not solvable

by radical (for a comprehensive presentation see ref. 17):

p is irreductible over z because it is irreductible over z5.

indeed modulo 5 it becomes
q(x) = 2(x5 + 4x4 + 2x3 + 2x + 2) which has no roots in z5. therefore p is irreductible over q.

let e/q be a splitting eld extension of p. as p has ve distinct roots, its galois group

g = gal(e/q) is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetry group s5 which is the permutation
.
= {x1, x2, x3, x4, x5}. as p has no repeated roots, p is separable so |g| = [e/q]
group of x
where |g| denotes the order of g and [e/q] is the index, i.e. the number of cosets q in g. if
 is a root of p then [q(), q] = 5 so |g| = [e/q] = [e/q()][q(), q] is divisible by 5. thus
g contains an element of order 5: the 5-cycle  = (12345).

the restriction to x of the complex conjugation gives rise to an element  of g:  =
(23)(45). as  is of order two, |g| is divisible by 2. moreover   = (124)  g is of order three
which divides |g|. thus |g| is a multiple of 5  2  3 = 30 and divides |s5| = 120. since s5
has no subgroup of order 30, |g|  {60, 120}. if |g| = 60 then g = a5 but  / a5. so g = s5.
sn is solvable for n  4 but is not solvable for n  5, so g is not solvable. then, by galois

theorem, p is not solvable by radicals.

by proposition 11 and 12, d(1, 2) is one of these xis, and the associated yi is a double root

of vef f (x0, y) . the corresponding zi is determined by solving f (xi, yi, z) = 0. then one

checks under which conditions each xi veries n(xi, yi, zi) = 2 and nally take the greatest one.

considering x0, one has y0 = d1, z0 = 0, and

the four point space shows that there is no hope to nd a general formula for the metric in

any commutative nite spaces: distances cannot be read directly in the dirac operator through

a nite algorithm. computing the metric requires a more pragmatic approach and shall be

undertaken case by case.

ix distances and axioms of noncommutative geometry.

in the previous discussion, we worked with triplets (a,h, d) as if they satised all the
axioms of noncommutative geometry. these axioms are introduced in order to recover the
standard spin and riemannian geometries in the commutative case2. accordingly, for our dis-

tances to be bona de noncommutative generalizations of riemaniann metrics, they have to be

computed using triples satisfying all these axioms.

however, these axioms lead, in the nite case18, to matrices whose size increases rapidly

with n and thus prevents any computation except in few simple cases. this is the reason why

we did not use these axioms up to now, but we shall see that the axioms do not put any con-

straints on the distances.

proposition 13. let (dij)1i,jn,i6=j be any nite sequence of possibly innite strictly posi-
tive numbers such that dij = dji and dij  dik +dkj. then there exists a spectral triple (a,h, d)
with a = cn satisfying all the axioms, and such that the resulting distance on the set of pure

20

states of a is given by the numbers dij.

to proceed, we shall rst prove the following lemma.

lemma 14. there is a spectral triple (a,h, d) with a = cn satisfying all the axioms such

that

k[d, (a)]k = sup

1i,jn,i6=j

|ai  aj|

dij

,

(18)

where a = (a1, . . . , an)  cn and  denotes the representation of a on h.

proof. the proof is by induction on n.
the rst non trivial case is n = 2. we take a2 = c2 and h2 = c3. the representation
2 and the chirality 2 are both diagonal and are given by 2(x1, x2) = diag(x1, x2, x2) and
2 = diag(1,1, 1). the dirac operator d2 and the charge conjugation j2 are dened as

d2 =


0
1
d12
0

d12

0

d12

 , j2 =


0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0


 c,

= 0 if d12 = .

where c is the complex conjugation and we set 1
d12

in the nite case, all axioms reduce to the reality, rst order, orientability and poincare
duality axioms18. in the present case, the rst two are commutation relations easy to check due

to the commutative nature of the algebra. the orientability axiom is fullled by writing the

chirality as

the multiplicity matrix is

2 = 2(1,1)j22(1, 1)j 1

2

.

1

2 =(cid:18) 0

1 1 (cid:19)

which is non degenerate and thus poincare duality holds. finally. one easily checks that

|| [d2, 2(x)]|| = |x1  x2|

d12

.

let us now assume that (an,hn, dn) together with n, n and jn have been constructed
for n > 2. to build the order n + 1 spectral triple, we merely imitate the n = 2 construction.
let us take a = cn+1 and

hn = hn1 (cid:18)n1
n(cid:19) ,
i=1 hi

21

n = c3, i, n. with respect to the previous decomposition all operators o corresponding

with hi
to d, ,  and j are block diagonal and dened inductively as
on = on1 (cid:18)n1
n(cid:19) .
i=1 oi

as in the n = 2 case, we dene

i
n(xi, xn) = diag(xi, xn, xn) , i

n = diag(1,1, 1).

the dirac operator dn and the charge conjugation jn are dened as

di

n =


0
1
din
0

1
din
0
1
din

0
1
din
0


 , j i

n =


0 0 1
0 1 0

1 0 0 
 c.

then it is easy to check that all axioms but poincare duality hold using the induction assumption

and the block diagonal nature of the construction.

the multiplicity matrix of this spectral triple is

n =


0
1
1 1
...
. . .
1 . . .

1
...
1

. . .
. . .
. . .
1 (n  1)




if n is any positive integer, we can always consider the trivial spectral triple (cn, cn  cn , 0)
with obvious representation and charge conjugation and whose chirality is equal to -1. if we
take the direct sum of this spectral triple with (an,hn, dn), the resulting multiplicity matrix
is n + nin, which is non degenerate for n suciently large. accordingly, poincare duality

will be satised.

finally, the computation of the norm of the commutator || [dn, n(a)]|| follows easily from

the block diagonal structure and the induction assumption. (cid:4)

to complete the proof of proposition 13, we use the previous lemma to construct a spectral
triple (a,h, d) fullling condition (18). if a veries the norm condition, then |ai  aj|  dij,
so d(i, j)  dij.

furthermore, if we x any two points such that dij <  and take xk = dik (which is nite
thanks to triangular inequality) one has |xi  xj| = dij. an other application of the triangular
inequality yields |dik  dil|  dkl for any k and l so that || [d, (x)]||  1 by (18). this shows
that dij  d(i, j) so that the equality holds when dij is nite.

if dij is innite, so are dik and djk for any k. thus, the inequality (18) does not constraint
xi and xj since the corresponding matrix element of d vanish.therefore, we can send |xi  xj|
to innity and we also have d(i, j) = dij. (cid:4)

22

x conclusion.

as a conclusion of previous discussion, we may say that once given a = cn, there is no
constraint arising from the axioms of noncommutative geometry. such constraints may only
appear if one imposes some extra conditions, such as xing h = cn as we did in the discussion
of the three and four point cases. we stress that we only showed that the map which associates

a metric to a dirac operator is surjective. in a discrete analogue of a quantum theory of gravity
based on eigenvalues of the dirac operators19, one also needs to know how many dirac operators

correspond to a given metric, as well as the possible relations between their spectra.

a naive question remains unanswered: what does these distances mean? according to
spectral action principle20, dirac operator encodes both physics and metrics. in the standard

model, computation of the action leads to the lagrangien of the full standard model and the

einstein-hilbert action of general relativity. so the coding of physics makes sense. but what

about the coding of metrics ? for the time beeing, the answer is clear in the simple continuous

case where noncommutative distance is the geodesic distance. distance in the geometry of

standard model should have physical meaning, but it has not been explicitly computed yet.
