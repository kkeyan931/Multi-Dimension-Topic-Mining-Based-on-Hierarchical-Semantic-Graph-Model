abstract

the recently discovered formalism underlying renormalization theory,
the hopf algebra of rooted trees, allows to generalize chens lemma. in
its generalized form it describes the change of a scale in green functions,
and hence relates to the operator product expansion. hand in hand with
this generalization goes the generalization of the ordinary factorial n! to
the tree factorial t!. various identities on tree-factorials are derived which
clarify the relation between connes-moscovici weights and quantum field
theory.

introduction

in this paper we want to explore a close resemblance between a mathematical
structure, iterated integrals [1], and a structure from physics, renormalization.
renormalization theory has been recently identied to be rooted in a hopf al-
gebra structure, which encapsulates its combinatorial properties [2]. further,
renormalization establishes a calculus which generalizes the algebraic approach
to the dieomorphism group, featured by connes and moscovici [3, 4]. struc-
tures due to this generalization are relevant for the practitioner of pqft [5].

here, we will study all these aspects in some detail, featuring in particular

the role of renormalization schemes, the renormalization group and the ope.

to proceed, we push forward to parallel developments. one is the use of
toy models at a more and more sophisticated level, which provide clarifying
examples to exhibit underlying ideas on which the reader can check formal de-
velopments, which will establish a set-up which allows to recover the standard

notions established by physicistes, the before mentioned existence of renormal-
ization schemes, renormalization groups and operator product expansions.

in this manner, we will show that the hopf algebra of rooted trees not only
describes the combinatorics of renormalization, but also analytical structure:
the behaviour under variations of scales.

throughout this paper we assume that the results and notions of [2, 3, 5, 6]
are familiar. we will nevertheless summarize some basic notions and conven-
tions.

1.1 notation

the hopf algebra of rooted trees (which are possibly decorated multiplicative
generators) is denoted by h, with coassociative coproduct , antipode s and
counit e. the multiplication in the algebra is denoted by m. it is commutative,
and hence s2 = 1. the unit of the algebra is sometimes denoted by e. the
underlying number-eld is assumed to be q.

the fertility of a vertex of a rooted tree is the number of outgoing edges.
the root is always drawn as the uppermost vertex, and all edges are oriented
away from the root.

rooted trees t are graded by their number of vertices #(t). for a product

of rooted treesqi ti we dene #(qi ti) =pi #(ti). obviously, #(e) = 0.
we abbreviate the coproduct using sweedlers notation: (t) =p t(1)  t(2)

t  h.

1.2 summary of sections

this paper is organized as follows.
in section two we introduce the iterated
integral. in particular, we focus on iterated integrals which have a divergence
at the upper boundary, which is a choice motivated by the renormalization
problem in qft, formulated in momentum space. we show how we get well-
dened iterated integrals as renormalized green functions, and show that a
variation of scales amounts to an application of chens lemma.

in section three we focus on the multiplicativity of renormalization. crucial
is the formulation of multiplicativity constraints, which are sucient to derive
the multiplicativity of counterterms. we present a boundary operator dr for
any renormalization scheme r and show that all renormalization schemes can
be treated on the same footing on the expense of introducing tree-indexed pa-
rameters.

section four applies those results to a restricted class of feynman diagrams,
those which represent trees with the same decoration at each vertex. such classes
were considered already in [5]. here, we use them to exemplify the results of
section three.

section ve proves some identities for rooted trees which were conjectured
in [5] and which are useful in understanding the relation to noncommutative

2

geometry.

section six gives the principal reason why operator product expansions are

related to chens lemma.

conclusions nish the paper. it is the main objective of this paper to in-
troduce and exhibit some essential properties of the hopf algebra approach un-
derlying renormalization, using iterated integrals as a convenient toy all along
on which the reader can test the relevant notions. the translation to proper
green functions is a notational exercise which can be conveniently spelled out
whenever needed.

while these paper introduces essential conceptual properties, details will be

presented in future work.

iterated integrals and renormalization

the crucial feature of renormalization is the fact that it is governed by its
underlying hopf algebra structure of rooted trees. bare green functions as they
appear in a perturbative approach to qft based on polynomial interactions
provide a representation of this hopf algebra. apart from a systematic access
to the renormalization problem of such qfts the hopf algebra also allows to
study other representations and hence to dene models for the renormalization
problem which deliver handy tools to study more advanced topics as the change
of scales and renormalization schemes. in this section, we will largely consider
iterated integrals for that purpose.

2.1 the iterated integral

we will start our considerations by reminding ourselves of some basic properties
of iterated integrals [1, 7]. we specialize to the case of a single function f (x)
with associated one-form f (x)dx on the real line.

then, iterated integrals built with the help of f are parametrized by an

integer n, and two real numbers a, t say. they are dened by

f [0]
a,t = 1, a, t  r,

f (x)f [n1]

a,x

dx, n > 0.

a

f [n]

a,t = z t
a,t =zax1<...<xnt

f [n]

hence we can write them as an integral over the simplex

f (x1) . . . f (xn)dx1 . . . dxn.

(1)

(2)

(3)

we can easily generalize this to the case of dierent functions fi, and, dening
a string of integers i = (i1, . . . , in), we can dene

f i

a,t =zax1<...<xn1xn

fi1(x1) . . . fin (xn)dx1 . . . dxn,

(4)

3

where ik are integers, taken from some index set i, labelling the available forms
fik (xk)dxk.

it is a well-known fact [7] that such integrals full a convolution

f i
a,t = f i

a,s + f i

s,t + xi=(i i )

f i 
a,sf i 
s,t ,

(5)

where the sum is over the n  1 partitions of the string i into two non-empty
substrings i , i . we shall dubb (5) chens lemma, following [7].

2.2 renormalization of iterated integrals

let us motivate our interest in iterated integrals and chens lemma. consider
again the trivial case of only one f and let us assume it behaves for large x  b
as f (x)  f (; x)  x1, for 0 <   1. let us then dene

g[t2]

b, =(cid:20)z 

b (cid:18)z 

x

f (y)dy(cid:19) f (x)dx(cid:21) .

(6)

then, in the limit   0, this expression is ill-dened. it has the structure of
a nested integration, furnishing a subdivergence (in ()-brackets) in the jargon
of renormalization theory, which is nested inside the nal x-integration, which
diverges as well and thus provides an overall divergence (in []-brackets).

to such a combination of ill-dened integrations we associate a rooted tree
t = t2(f, f ), as in fig.(1), following the guidance of [2, 3]. generalizing to
arbitrary n, we dene, b  r+, functions

g[e]

b, = 1,

g[tn]

b, = (cid:20)z 

b (cid:16)g[tn1]

x, (cid:17) f (x)dx(cid:21) , n  1.

(7)

(8)

to them, we assign the rooted tree tn := bn
+(e) of n vertices without side-
branching, as in fig.(1), and understand that the empty tree, the unit e of the
hopf algebra h, is associated to g[e]
b, = 1. as a a decorated rooted tree tn
carries the same decoration f at each vertex.

it is straightforward to see that the the trees tn form a closed sub-hopf
algebra hchen of h, which is a hopf algebra based on rooted trees without
sidebranchings:

[tn] = tn  1 + 1  tn +

ti  tni

xi=1

s[tn] = tn

figure 1: rooted trees describe nested integrations. we give the trees
t1, t2, t31 , t32 from left to right and a decorated tree without sidebranchings,
bn
+(e), with decorations fn to f1. also, we explicitly give the tree t2(f1, f2) for
the case n = 2.

this remains true for decorated rooted trees and in the same spirit, we can
assign a decorated rooted tree ti to any function

g[ti ]

b, = z 

b

g[t

x,fin (x)dx,

(11)

where t
i is the rooted tree b(ti ), providing an index string which has the
n-th entry in of i deleted. the hopf algebra of decorated rooted trees without
sidebranchings is still denoted by hchen.

note that the functions g[ti ]

b, can be regarded as iterated integrals in their

own right:

g[ti ]

b, = lim


f i

,b.

(12)

all the functions fi, i  n, are assumed to behave as limx fi(x) =
cixji, for some constant ci and some integer ji with ji  1. hence, in the
limit   0, these iterated integrals are ill-dened, due to a divergence at the
upper boundary. we will have to renormalize them. the hopf algebra will
allow us to nd a way to make sense out of the expressions g[ti ]
b, at  = 0.
we will discuss further aspects of the behaviour at innity in some detail later.
all renormalization properties discussed below extend in an obvious way to
the renormalization at endpoints dierent from innity, if it so happens that
the functions fi(x) have singularities at such endpoints. the renormalization
procedure is a very natural thing to do, as we will see, and one can dene appli-
cations largely extending the task of eliminating uv divergences. an obvious
application is to the conguration space of n distinct points, which can be tested

5

out by dierential forms which diverge at (sub-)diagonals. such an application
will be described in [8].

we can multiply the functions and add the functions g[ti ]

b, freely. hence, if
 : r+  hchen  v is the map which assigns to any decorated rooted tree
ti  hchen and positive real number b the function g[ti ]
b,, then this gives us a
representation, parametrized by b,

(b; ti tj ) = (b; ti )(b; tj ).

(13)

we also set (b; 0) = 0 and (b; e) = 1, b, in accordance with (1). for a chosen
b, we further write b : hchen  v , t  b(t)  (b; t). the target space v can
be considered as the ring r[1, ] of laurent series with poles of nite order.
the parameter b is from now on denoted as the scale of the representation.
the functions (b, t) = g[t]
b, can be considered as role models for bare green
functions. they depend on an external scale b. we will utilize this dependence
to dene the renormalization procedure.

let ra be the map which sends b  a. we thus evaluate at a dierent
scale. essentialy, we claim, it is this change of external scale(s) which allows
us to renormalize in a non-trivial manner. to the bare green function b :
hchen  v , which denes a representation of hchen, we associate another
function sra (b) : hchen  v by

sra(b)(t) := ra[b(t) + m[(sra  id)(b  b)p2(t)]],

(14)

dened for any monomial t of decorated rooted trees, t 6= e. for t = e we set
sra(b)(e) = 1. the resulting map sra (b) is independent of b by the denition
of ra which eliminates any dependence on the scale b. two examples, t = t1(fi)
and t = t2(fi, fj) might be useful:

sra (b)(t1(fi)) = a(t1(fi)) =z 

a

sra(b)(t2(fi, fj)) = a(t2(fi, fj)) + a(t1(fi))a(t1(fj))

fi(x)dxz

now, we dene a function  : r+  r+  hchen  v by

a,b(t) = x sra(b)(t(1)) b(t(2))

= m[(sra  id)(b  b)(t)]
= m[(ra  b)(s  id)(t)],

where we dene ra : hchen  v by ra = sra (b  s).

(17)

(19)

ra is still independent of b by the denition of ra. note further that a,b(t)
exists in the limit   0 when we integrate to innity and can be regarded as
the renomalized iterated integral associated to the bare iterated integral gt
b,.
the equality between (18) and (19) follows because of sra  b = sra  b  s2 =
ra  s,using the denition of ra and s2 = id.
prop.1: a,b(t) = (1)n+1f i
where t is the decorated rooted tree with n vertices corresponding to the string
i.
proof: straightforward (for example, use (5) and that gt
integral from b to ).

we now read this as an instructive example for renormalization. the role of a
bare green function, demanding renormalization, is played by gt
b,  b(t). it
provides n1 subdivergences, as all integrations diverge at the upper boundary.
then, sra [(ti )] delivers a counterterm such that a,b(ti ) is a quantity
which is renormalized: it contains only well-dened integrations and the limit
  0 can be taken at the level of integrands.

note that if the bare green function would be independent of the external
scale furnished by the parameter b, then a(t) = b(t) and as a consequence,
a,b(t)  0.1

this can be utilized to show that a,b(t) is determined by the coecient of
logarithmic divergence at innity. it is thus natural to look for a representation
of h in terms of residues in the sense of [9].

for the moment, we note that the presence of a second scale a is unavoidable
if we want to go from bare functions to renormalized ones. a,b(t) is essentially
the ratio of two representations, one parametrized by b, the other by a. we call
a the renormalization point. for all possible values of the external scale b there
is one place, the diagonal b = a, at which b,b(t) = 0. further,

ra(a,b(t)) = ra[(sra  id)b](t) = e(t),

(22)

showing that sra is the inverse of the identity in the range vra of ra in v .
this inverse is taken with respect to the induced star product in h

annihilates scale independent terms from the beginning, and is hence extremely economic.

let us summarize: we start with a bunch of ill-dened integrations, labelled
by a decorated rooted tree t from which we can determine the bare integral
demanding renormalization.

chen  v  h

we then construct the analytic expressions determined by the counterterm
map sra : h
chen  v . this gives rise to a renormalized iter-
ated integral a,b(t) which only involves well-dened integrations. it assigns a
well-dened analytic expression to any decorated rooted tree. this expression
necessary vanishes along the diagonal a = b. in contrast to this, b associated
the ill-dened bare integral b(t) to any rooted tree t. this transition from b(t)
to a,b(t) is what renormalization typically achieves.

a nal remark in this section concerns the solution to the kniszhnik-zamo-
1z , say. see

(24)

here, a and b are two noncommuting variables which actually provide a free lie
algebra on two elements. arbitrary words out of the two-letter alphabet {a, b}
are considered and no relation amongst such words exist. let w be the set of
all words.

the length of such a word w is l(w) and the ith letter of w is w(i). let us

consider the following expression

g(u, v) = xwwz(u,v) yi:w(i)=a

dzi

zi yi:w(i)=b

dzi

(1  zi)

(u, v) = u > zl(w) > . . . > z1 > v.

(25)

(26)

g(u, v) is known to be a solution to the k-z equation in the interval ]0, 1[.

g(u, v) contains multiple zeta values (mzvs) for (u, v) = (1, 0), whenever
the limits u  1, v  0 are dened. but whenever a word starts with b or ends
with a these limits do not exist.

hence this solution is a series pw wf w

v,u over all words built out of two
noncommuting variables a, b multiplying iterated integrals f w
v,u in the inerval
]0, 1[ which possibly diverge at both endpoints of the interval ]0, 1[. let w  be
the words which neither start with b nor end with a.

renormalization can be applied to g(u, v) such that it extends to either
boundary, and applying it successively using the renormalization schemes r0
(which removes all words ending with a) and r1 (which removes all words
beginning with b) at the lower and upper boundaries leaves us with the k-z

rooted tree bm1
+ for the renormalization at the upper boundary 1 (where b
is the variable assigned to dz/(1  z)). for the renormalization at the lower
boundary it represents bnk
+ (where a is the variable assigned to dz/z). then,
the renormalized iterated integral assigned to g(u, v) extends to [0, 1], where it
is the above k-z associator.

2.3 change of scales

it is most interesting to consider the behaviour if we change the renormalization
point a  a. one gets

a,b(ti ) = xi=(i ,i )

a,a (ti )a,b(ti  ).

(28)

proof: this is just (5) for iterated integrals [7]. nevertheless, let us derive it
from the hopf algebra structure of h. dene the following operator

u : h  h  h  h  v

u = m[m  m](ra  a  ra  b).

composition with m : h  h  h  h  h,

m : = (s  id  s  id)(  )

= (s  id  s  id)(  id  id)(id  )
= (s  id  s  id)(id    id)(id  )

(29)

(30)

(31)

gives

u [m (t)] = ra [s(t(1))]a [t(2)]ra [s(t(3))]b[t(4)],

where coassociativity of hr allows to use sweedlers notation throughout. the
above is

ra [s(t(1))]m[(a  ra )(id  s)(t(2))]b(t(3)).

(32)

as

m[(a  ra )(id  s)(t)] = a (m[(id  s)(t)]) = a (e(t)) = a (0) = 0,

t 6= 1, this has contributions only for t(2) = e, in which case we obtain

m[(ra  b)(t)],

(33)

as desired. we used sra (b) = a  s, which we prove later, see (45).

nothing in this derivation prevents us to generalize to arbitrary rooted trees,
extending from hchen to h. we thus dene, for a decorated rooted tree t  h
with n vertices,

gt

b, = z 

b

fin (x)yj

g[t]j

where the product is over the decorated branches of the decorated tree t,

b,, but stress that b(t) : h  v now gives parametrized

still write b(t) for gt
representation for the full hopf algebra h of decorated rooted trees.

b(t) = qj t

we also dene sra(b)(t) and a,b(t) without any change:

sra(b)(t) = ra[b(t) + m[(sr  id)(b  b)p2(t)]]

(35)

and

a,b(t) = x sra (b(t(1)))b(t(2))

= m[(sra  id)(b  b)(t)]
= m[(ra  b)(s  id)(t)].

(36)

as the reader should check. the underbracings indicate the tree structure of the
nested and disjoint subintegrations, which is also exemplied in fig.(2).

a few remarks. we obtain a natural generalization of the iterated integral.
actually, due to the fact that iterated integrals obey the shue product, it is not
yet a generalization, as any bare integral representing a tree with side branch-
ings is a linear combination of integrals representing trees in hchen. hence,
at this stage, the generalization is merely a convenient notation. but there are

10

f1

more generalizations lying ahead, considering representations of h which ex-
tend the notions of iterated integrals truely, still obeying the convolution which
implies chens lemma for ordinary iterated integrals. in particular, bare green
functions as typically derived from feynman rules in the perturbative approach
to a local qft represent rooted trees in a manner such that trees with side-
branchings cannot be reexpressed in terms of trees without sidebranchings, as
a shue product is absent in such circumstances.2 nevertheless, the derivation
of the convolution of renormalized functions is a mere application of the coas-
sociativity of h itself, and hence applies whenever appropriate representations
of the hopf algebra are available.

it will be an interesting exercise in the future to understand the monodromy
of green functions from this approach in the same manner as one can under-
stand the monodromy of the polylogarithm from the study of the renormalized
solution of the k-z equation. green functions in qft are a more general class of
functions than polylogs. nevertheless, at lower loop orders, they are intimately
related which might well be understood one day as testimony to the fact that
green functions in pqft realize in a wider set-up algebraic structures which
polylogs strictly obey.

another generalization lies in the possibility to consider tree-indexed param-
eters in the integral. this will turn out a convenient means to parametrize the
freedom which we have in the renormalization approach. to this idea we come
back soon.

it is an interesting question which information about a manifold m such
generalizations can provide, using as functions fi the pull-back of appropriate
forms i via paths on that manifold, or, vice versa, how one can construct
manifolds providing, eventually, iterated integrals which evaluate to the same
green functions as a qft. this amounts to setting up and solving appropriate
systems of equations, making use of the recursive properties of the hopf algebra.
apart from a few further remarks along these lines in the next section the reader
will nd examples in [10].

before we consider further generalizations by tree-indexed scales, we come

2though, as to be reported elesewhere, some remainders of it are still visible in qft.

11

to some interesting structures which can be readily observed at this level.

3 multiplicativity of renormalization and conse-

quences

so far, we observed how a change in the renormalization point is expressed by
the generalized form of chens lemma. this gives a very nice handle on the
renormalization group (see below), and relates it to quite general algebraic con-
siderations. while in this paper we will only outline the basic concepts, concrete
applications will be worked out in future work. also, in [5], the reader already
nds applications which prove the usefulness of the reduction of renormalization
concepts to the hopf algebraic set-up.

3.1 multiplicativity

remarkable features appear when one engulfes in a detailed study of the prop-
erties under a change of renormalization schemes. to this end, let us come back
to the map b : h  v . clearly, t 6= e,

0 = b(0) = b(m[(s  id)(t)]) = m[(b  b)(s  id)(t)].

(42)

compare the expression on the rhs with the expression for a,b(t)

a,b(t) = m[(ra  b)(s  id)(t)].

(43)

hence, this expression is non-vanishing only because of sra  b  s  ra 6= b,
hence, essentially only if a 6= b.3 there is a map b : h  v  v induced by
b,

b = (b  b)  ,

(44)

and an induced map sb : h  v , sb = b  s. it is more interesting to consider
the map r : h  v  h  v given by r() = sr[  s] dened for any  :
h  v . we will now show that r(r()) = r(), which is the natural extension
of r2 = r. this will allow us to dene beautiful cohomological properties for
renormalization. we start with the consideration of renormalization schemes
which merely vary external parameters. in the following, the reader should have
in mind that a, b are to be considered as representatives of appropriate sets
of external parameters (masses, external momenta in green functions) which
parametrize analytic expressions representing elements of h.

it suces to show

sra (b)(t) = a(s(t)),

(45)

3one has rb = b, as one immediately checks.

12

which one readily proves by induction on the number of vertices of t:

sra(b)(t) = ra[b(t) + m[(sra  id)(b  b)p2(t)]]

= a(t)  ra[m[(a  b)(s  id)p2(t)]]
= a (t  m[(s  id)p2(t)])
= a(s(t)).

in the second line, we used that

ra[a(t)b(t)] = ra[a(t)]ra[b(t)], t, t  h,

(46)

(47)
(48)

(49)

(50)

an equation which is fullled by ra, but not by general renormalization maps.
if we regard a renormalization map r : v  v as simply a map from
v (considered as a vector space) to v , then, in general, r[xy] 6= r[x]r[y],
x, y  v .

a good example is a minimal subtraction scheme, which we will discuss in
some detail below. we can dene its renormalization map rm s by a projection
to the pole part: if

1 6= v =



xi:=0

ck+ik+i  r[1, ]

for some positive integer k, then

rm s(v) =

k1

xi:=0

ck+ik+i.

(51)

(52)

clearly, rm s[xy] 6= rm s[x]rm s[y]. nevertheless, rm s fulls the multiplica-
tivity constraints (m.c.s) which we formulate for an arbitrary renormalization
map r as

r

r[xi]

yi=1

r[xi]# =
r" r
yi=1
(xi  r[xi])# = 0,
r" r
yi=1

(53)

(54)

and

both valid for some positive integer r > 1, and arbitrary xi  v . note that,
setting r = 2 and x2 = 1, the rst constraint implies r[r[x1]] = r[x1] and
hence r[x1  r[x1]] = 0. the second constraint establishes the same property
also for products of such dierences.

we call these constraints the multiplicativity constraints, as one can show

that for maps r in accordance with these constraints one has
prop.2:

sr"yi

xi# =yi

13

sr[xi].

(55)

we can prove this statement under fairly general circumstances: let h be a
graded, commutative hopf algebra with coproduct , antipode s, multiplication
m, unit e and counit e, over some number eld f . let e be the standard
inclusion of f in h, e : f  fe  h. note that s2 = id.

let a representation  : h  v be given. this includes the case  = id,
v = h itself. in the following, we discuss only this case, the changes necessary
for the general case are obvious and demand only the insertion of the map
 : h  v at appropriate places.

let then r be a map r : h  h which fulls the m.c.s (53,54). it need not
be an algebra endomorphism, r(xy) 6= r(x)r(y). we also demand r(e) = e.
dene p2 : h  h  h  h by

p2 = (id  e  e)  (id  e  e),

(56)

so that we can write

(x) = p2((x)) + e  x + x  e  [e  e  e  e](x).

(57)

then, the antipode can be written in the form

s(x) = x  m[(s  id)p2(x)] + ee(x),

(58)

using m[(s  id)(x)] = e  e(x) and (57). for any map r as above, we dene

sr(x) = r[x + m[(sr  id)p2(x)]] + ee(x).

(59)

this denition works recursively, as sr on the rhs is applied to elements of
lower degree than x. we also set sr(e) = e. we now prove prop.(2):
it suces to prove the assertion for elements which full e(x) = 0. otherwise,
one decomposes x = (x  e  e(x)) + e  e(x).

so let x, y be two elements which are annihilated by the counit. then,

sr(xy ) = r[xy ]  r[u ],

where u = m[(sr  id)p2(xy )], hence

u = sr[x]y + sr[y ]x + sr[xy ]y  + sr[y ]xy  + sr[y x ]x 

+sr[x y ]x y ,

(60)

(61)

abbreviating (x) = x   x , even omitting the summation sign, and so on.
now, as h is a graded hopf algebra by assumption, we can proceed by induction
on that grading. assume that the assertion holds for products of grade n, we
prove that it holds for grade n + 1.

thus, by assumption we write u as

u = sr[x]y + sr[y ]x + sr[x]sr[y ]y  + sr[y ]xy  + sr[y ]sr[x ]x 
(62)

+sr[x ]sr[y ]x y .

14

now, we use the fact that r fullls the multiplicativity constraints to write

r[xy ] = r[x]r[y ] + r[r[x] y ] + r[r[y ] x]

r[ux uy ] = r[ux]r[uy ] + r[r[ux] uy ] + r[r[uy ] ux ]

where z := z  r[z], z  h and

ux := sr(x )x  = m[(sr  id)p2(x)]

(63)

(64)

(65)

and similarly for uy . we also use sr(x) = r[x]  r[ux]. plugging this all
in, one nds

 r[xy ]  r[u ] = (r[x] + r[ux ])(r[y ] + r[uy ]) = sr(x)sr(y ),

(66)

as desired. 

now, renormalization maps all serve one and the same purpose: to eliminate
the undesired divergences in the theory. typically, they can be considered
as transformations which do not alter the behaviour at large internal scales
(internal refererring here to scales which are to be integrated out) such that
one can establish well-dened ratios like the functions a,b(t) dened before. in
such ratios the dependence on large internal scales drops out and hence we nd
nite results for renormalized green functions. general renormalization maps
r useful in applications in qft can be simply considered as maps which full
the multiplicativity constraints, but not necessarily the algebra homomorphism
property r[xy] = r[x]r[y].

realizing that one can label contributions to green functions of pqft by
b,,

decorated rooted trees in the same manner as we did so far with functions gt
we consider quite generally maps  from h to some appropriate space v .

let us then introduce, for any such  : h  v ,

r : h  v, r(t) = sr[](s(t))

(67)

where r is any map which fulls the multiplicativity constraints (53,54). sr :
h  v is still dened as

sr() = r[ + m((sr  id)(  )p2].

then, as before, let r be the corresponding map

r : h  v  h  v, r() = r = sr[  s].

all the maps r are algebra homomorphisms, due to (55).

then, we dene r, : h  v by

r,(t) = m[(r  )(s  id)(t)].

(68)

(69)

(70)

15

for example, setting  = b, r = ra we recover the previous denition. we
clearly have

r,(t) = [r  s  ](t).

(71)

note that r, calculates the ratio of the two representations r,  with respect
to the convolution product, forming the ratio with the help of the antipode, as
it should be. in general, one can dene, for any two representations u, v 
h  v ,

then, the generalized form of chens lemma takes the form

u,v(t) = [u  s  v](t).

u,v(t) = [u,s  s,v] (t),

(72)

(73)

where u, s, v are labels indexing dierent representations u, v, s : h  v .
ra , b were examples, as are r, .

let us show that r  r() = r(),

r  r() = sr(sr())

= r[sr() + m((sr  id)(sr()  sr())p2]
= r[sr() + m((sr  id)(id  sr)(  )(s  id)p2)]
= r[sr() + sr[m((s  id)p2)]]
= r[sr[  m((s  id)p2)]]
= r[sr[  s]] = sr(  s) = r(),

as sr maps to the range of r and r2 = r. hence, renormalization maps r
which full the multiplicativity constraints full r2() = r(). further, if we
have a renormalization scheme r and representations ,   h  v such that
sr () =   s (that is, (45) holds), then lemma 1 holds in the form

r, = r,  r,,

(74)

where r can be any renormalization scheme.

in (74) we see that the rhs depends on the intermediate representation ,
which does not appear on the lhs. if we regard  as charaterized by an appro-
priate (set of) parameter(s) b, and  characterized by a (set of) parameter(s)
b, we can apply a dierentiation with respect to b to nd

0 =

d
db

[r,  r,] =(cid:18) 

b

r,(cid:19)  r, + r, (cid:18) 

b

r,(cid:19) ,

(75)

which is a proto-type renormalization group equation. it expresses as a dieren-
tial equation the independence of an intermediate scale. note that in the limit
b  b the nite ratio r, becomes an innitesimal quantity. note further
that the dependence on b of the second term on the rhs is given by the fact that

16

sr () =   s. the exercise to cast the renormalization group explicitly in
this language is a purely notational one, taking into account the dependence on
parameters like charges, masses etc and hence establishing a coupled systems of
such equations, which we postpone to future work. various viewpoints about
renormalization group equations ranging from standard bphz approaches to
the wilson viewpoint can be obtained from (74,75) depending on which param-
eters for an intermediate scale one chooses, with dimensionful parameters of
bare green functions or physical cut-os being some obvious choices.

3.2 cohomological properties of renormalization

let us consider the following problem. given is a perturbative qft, dened
by feynman rules. this denes a series in graphs graded by the number of
vertices. the graphs translate to unique analytical expressions, which decom-
pose into feynman integrands and integrations, determined by the cycles in the
graph. powercounting establish a well-dened subset of supercially divergent
subgraphs, and eventually, we realize that each of these graphs represents an
element of h [2, 3, 5].

the analytic expressions are parametrized by external momenta and masses,
which can be regarded as complex parameters generalizing the external scale b
of the iterated integral. for a given feynman graph , let for now b rep-
resent this set of parameters. the integration is over internal loop momenta
along propagators (edges) (or over internal vertices, in x-space) and diverges
(in momentum space) when the internal momenta get large. let us specify a
renormalization scheme by saying that for any graph  we have dened a set
of conditions on the parameters b, for example conditions that the square of
external momenta equals some mass square. let  be the set of parametrs b
modied in accordance with these conditions. these parameters are provided
by the integrand constructed according to the feynman rules.4

the renormalized green function established by this set-up can be calculated

as

(76)
where t  h is obtained from , and b maps it to an analytic expressions
according to the feynman rules and all other notation is self-evident.

r ,b (t) = [sr (b )  b ](t),

this can be written in the form, in an obvious shorthand notation,

r, = m  (r  id)(b  b)  (s  id),

(77)

which shows that we fail by the deviation of r from the identity (in h  v )
to get a trivial result. the interesting operator in the above is clearly r  id.
we now consider a sequence of renormalizations sending b0  bn by an

intermediate sequence of renormalizations b0  b1  . . .  bn, using

bi1  rbi1 ,bi

= bi1  rbi1 (bi  s)  bi

4there is an analogous story in x-space to be developped elsewhere.

17

= bi1  bi1  s  bi
= bi1 [id  s]  bi
= bi1 [e]  bi
= bi .

let us introduce

by

so that we obtain

dr : h  v  (h  v )2

dr(bi ) = rbi1 (bi )  bi ,

bn = m [[b1  drb1

(b2 )  drb2

(b3 )  . . .  drbn1

(bn )]

(id  [s  id](n1)2n1)],

(78)

(79)

(80)

(81)

where m is a concatenation of 2n multiplication maps, m : v 2n+1  v , and
2n+1 : h  h2n+1 is the obvious map in h sending h  h2n+1 using the
coproduct, unique due to coassociativity of the latter.

this motivates to dene dr for elements (h  v )n.

dr(1  2  . . .  n) =

n

xi=1

(1)i+11  . . .  d(i)  . . .  n,

(82)

where it is understood that d(i) = ri1(i)  i, i > 1 and d(1) = dr(1) =
r(1)  1.

then, one immediately checks, using r2 = r,

d2
r = 0,

(83)

for example:

dr(dr(1)) = r(r(1))  r(1)  1  r(1)  r(1)  1 = 0.

(84)

in this language, we have

bn = m [[b1  d(2)(s  id)  . . .  d(n)(s  id)]2n+1]

(85)

and for the renormalized green function

dr(n) = m [d(1)(s  id)  (d2)(s  id)  . . .  (dn)(s  id)2n+2].

(86)

in short, taking into account that the actions of m, ..., (s  id) are obvious:

n = 1d2 . . . dn and dn = d1 . . . dn.

(87)

18

we recommend that the reader tries these formula out on several simple exam-
ples and marvels at their obvious cohomological relevance especially in compar-
ison with [9].

we realize that the change of scales, so typically a step in the whole of
physics, naturally carries cohomolgical structure which gives hope to be able to
cast locality in a well-dened mathematical framework in the future.

much more can and should be said about these aspects. here, we have to

refer the reader to future work [8].

3.3 tree-indexed scales and the equivalence of schemes

let us come back to chens lemma and to iterated integrals. there are further
generalizations lying ahead. so far, we used (generalized) iterated integrals as
quantities which are naturally indexed by rooted trees, and to which the previous
considerations apply. the rooted trees determined how the various dierential
forms fi(x)dx are combined under the (indenite) integral operator, but outer
boundaries where kept constant throughout.

3.3.1 tree indexed scales

a generalization which turns out to be quite useful in practice is to let even
these boundaries be indexed by decorated rooted trees. hence, we redene

(88)

gb,(t) =z 

bt

fin (x)y gt

x,dx

which is dened as before, only that we now label the lower outer boundary
by a decorated rooted tree t. we understand that the map ra maps lower
boundaries bt to at, and that the coproduct action extends to this label. similar
considerations apply to full-edged green functions of pqft, where one can
utilize the presence of scale dependent parameters to make them tree-dependent
in the same manner. this idea will be pursued in the next section, and in [10].

if t2(f1, f2) is the decorated rooted tree of fig.(1) with coproduct

(t2(f1, f2)) = t2(f1, f2)  e + e  t2(f1, f2) + t1(f1)  t2(f2)

(89)

we formally obtain

sra(b)(t2(f1, f2)) ="z 

at2 z 

at1

z 
at z 

x # f2(x)f1(y)dydx.

(90)

and

(91)

in this notation, a, b are to be regarded as representing actually a whole set of
constants at, bt, parametrizing the relevant scales for the decorated tree consid-
ered.

still, (39) applies and describes what happens if we change the renormaliza-

tion point. a,b = a,s  s,b now becomes

x

which is evidently true, as the reader should check. it is instructive to see the
lemma (1) in action for this simple example.

finiteness of a,b now imposes conditions on the tree-indexed parameters, a

fact which we will utilize in the next section.

3.3.2 equivalence of schemes

conceptually, the presence of tree-indexed parameters allows to describe dif-
ferent renormalization schemes on a similar footing. the idea is the following.
let us compare for example a bphz on-shell scheme in comparison with mini-
mal subtracted dimensional renormalization. in the former case, one eectively
subtracts at the level of integrands. hence, one has an integrand which gives
rise to a non-existent measure with respect to the loop integrations. the inte-
grand is parametrized by several constants (masses, external momenta), which
essentially play the role of the boundaries in our iterated integrals. a renor-
malization scheme in the bphz spirit would map, upon applying the antipode
srbp hz , such an integrand to another one, for which these parameters fulll
certain conditions (on-shell, for example). the structure of srbp hz achieves
that these counterterms are local [2, 6, 3].

then, the map rbp hz ,(t) so-constructed delivers a subtracted integrand
which actually establishes a well-dened measure with respect to all loop inte-
grations. here, t is the decorated rooted tree assigned to the integrand according
to powercounting [2, 3, 6, 5]. hence, bphz-type schemes avoid the use of reg-
ularization altogether.

on the other hand, in dimensional renormalization using minimal subtrac-
tion (ms scheme), one introduces regularization and evaluates the bare green-
functions rst, obtaining laurent series in the regularization parameters. the

20

antipode achieves a subtraction of these poles which respects locality, and sim-
ilarly one constructs the ms-renormalized rm s ,(t) using srm s .

in the next section we will use the idea to have tree-indexed scales to show
that we can regard a ms-scheme as a bphz type scheme on the expense of
having to introduce tree-dependent scales.

4 applications

to keep the amount of notation simple, we will consider representations of h
dened as follows. assume that we are given a set of functions bk(x) which are
laurent series in x with a rst-order pole. using vertex weights as dened in
section ve below we can dene a function

gz(t; x) = yvt [0]

bw(v)(x)znx = bt(x)znx,

(92)

where n is the number of vertices of t and z is to be regarded as the scale

parametrizing the representation. we also wrote qvt [0] bw(v)(x) = bt(x).

quite a number of interesting applications can be brought to this form [5, 10].
typically, whenever we iterate a feynman diagram in terms of itself as described
by a rooted tree, one nds such representations. many examples are given in
[5]. the case of general feynman diagrams is obtained by nding a proper
notation for the case of dierent decorations, and by taking into account a proper
form-factor decomposition. we refer the reader to [10] for further applications,
extending to such cases.

hence, in the notation of the previous section, we set z(t) = gz(t; x). then,

we dene the ms renormalization scheme by setting

rm s  z =< 1 >,

(93)

where angle brackets denote projection on the pole part of the laurent series in
x inside the brackets. let then the counterterm dened by srm s (z) and the
renormalized green function by m s(z)(t) = [srm s (z) z](t), as usual. the
reader should have no diculties conrming that for t2, the rooted tree with
two vertices,

srm s (z)(t2) =  < b2b1 > + << b1 > b1 >,

(94)

and

rm s ,z (t2) = b2b1z2x < b1 > b1zx < b2b1 > + << b1 > b1 > .

(95)
let us compare such an approach with an on-shell approach. using the same
bare functions, we dene the on-shell renormalization map r as

r  z = .

(96)

21

if the gz(t; x) are provided by integrals whose integration is regularized by x
where z is a parameter of the integrand, then the renormalization map just sets
this external parameter to the value .

r,z (t) = [sr [z]  z](t) is a function which has a subtracted integrand
it

such that typically the limit x  0 exists at the level of the integrand.
becomes a taylor series in log(z/).

let us now cast the ms renormalized green function in this form on the

expense of introducing tree-dependent scales t.

hence, we redene r()(t) = t (t), and get, still spelling out the example

t = t2,

sr (z)(t) = b2b12x
we remind ourselves that s(t2) = t2 + t1t1.

t + b1b12x

t1

.

(97)

it is easy to work out the general case. to see this, we look at the trees with

up to three vertices. the antipode zt := srm s (z)(t) in ms reads

zt1 =  < b1 >,
zt2 =  < b2b1 > + << b1 > b1 >,
zt31

=  < b3b2b1 > + << b1 > b2b1 > + << b2b1 > b1 >

 <<< b1 > b1 > b1 >,

zt32

=  < b3b2

1 > +2 << b1 > b2b1 >

 <<< b1 > b1 > b1 > .

(105)

22

one also conrms that now

rm s ,z (t) = r,z (t)

(106)

holds. note that we can discard the use of a regularization scheme in rm s ,z
as we observe that the scales t are functions which exist in the limit x  0,
which one conrms by using that b

t/bt = 1 + o(x) in (104).

conceptually, this eliminates any dierence between a bphz type scheme
and regularization followed by a minimal subtraction. each divergent subgraph
can be subtracted at its own scale, such that a subtraction with such tree-
dependent sets of parameters equals the result of the use of a ms scheme.
actually, there remains an argument in favour of minimal subtraction: it incor-
porates from the beginning the wisdom that it is only logarithmic divergence
which counts. any integrand providing a dierent degree of divergence can be
cast in the form of a log divergent integrand, (multiplied by a polynomial in ex-
ternal parameters) plus scale-independent terms.5 the latter do not contribute
anyhow after renormalization, and are economically eliminated in dimensional
renormalization from the beginning.

we know that bt is of order o(1/x#t), as is b(t). one immediately proves

that the dierence is of lower order

[bt  b

t]  o(1/x#t1).

(107)

this is a direct consequence of the fact that the antipode s of h fullls s2 = 1.
indeed, to leading order in 1/x we have

b

t = xfull cuts c of t

(1)nc < [yi

= srm s [zt]
= zs(t) = z(s2(t)) = bt,

< zti > ztr >

(108)

(109)
(110)

where we used that to leading order << a > b >=< a >< b > for arbitrary
expressions a, b, and we used (45). as these properties are true not only for
minimal subtraction but for any renormalization scheme, we conclude that in
any renormalization scheme the leading pole part is the same, a property well-
known to the practitioner.
it is nice to see it traced back to the fact that
s2 = 1.

once more, it is instructive to write down the rst couple of cases for b
t.

it is not a big surprise to see that a change of renormalization scheme can
produce a lot of junk at subleading orders.

a nal remark concerns momentum schemes, hence schemes which full
(45). we know already that the convolution product holds for renormalization
schemes. the structure of the convolution product indicates how we translate
a renormalized green function, r,b(t), determined by a scheme r and pa-
rameter(s) b, to r,b (t). both utilize the same freely chosen renormalization
r = 0. the transition b  b uses the convo-
scheme r giving an operator dr, d2
lution by reparametrizations of the external parameter(s) b, hence a convolution
using momentum schemes. they thus typically provide the general mediator for
renormalized green functions, as was exhibited in [5].

5 tree factorials and cm weights

in this section we want to prove some basic results concerning tree-factorials
and connes moscovici weights. both entities are combinatorial in nature. for
simplication, we work in the undecorated hopf algebra.

let t [0] be the set of vertices of the rooted tree t . for any vertex v of t ,
let tv = p c(t ), where c is the single cut which removes the edge incoming to v.
also, #(tv) is the number of vertices of the monomial tv. then, we dene the
tree factorial by

t ! = yvt [0]

(#(tv) + 1)  yvt [0]

w(v),

(115)

which also explains the vertex weights w(v). fig.(3) gives instructive examples.

the next denition concerns the symmetry factor st of a tree t . for any
v  t [0] consider b(tv). this is a monomial in rooted trees, hence a product
of branches

b(tv) =

tv,i.

(116)

f (v)

yi=1

in general, some of these branches can be the same rooted tree, and hence these

products can be written as productsq over dierent rooted trees with integer

powers:

the upper row we indicate the vertex weights at each vertex in the middle and
the vertex symmetries at the right. the second row considers natural growth of
3 = t31 + t32 . it obtains on the rhs of the equation four trees with cm-weights
1, 3, 1, 1. we also indicate the feet of these four trees.

we associate to the vertex v its vertex symmetry, built from the factorials of
the multiplicities nj with which a tree tv,j originates from v,

and dene

st,v =q
st = yvt [0]

jnj!

st,v.

(118)

(119)

fig.(3) gives examples for these notions, which were already used in [5]. in that
paper, the symmetry factor st was dubbed (t ) and the vertex symmetry of
the root st,r was simply denoted as (t ).6

we now dene the connes moscovici weights cm (t ) for a tree t with n

vertices as

cm (t ) :=< zt , n >,

(120)
where < ,  > is the pairing of [3], < zt , t  >= t,t  , and n = n n(e) is
the n-fold application of natural growth to e, delivering the generators of the
commutative part of the cm-hopf subalgebra of h, obtained by natural growth
n applied n times, cf. fig(3).

6for a tree t with root vertex r one can consider st ,r to dene what could be dubbed the
moebius function (t ) of t : (t ) = 0 i the branches at r are not square-free (hence if some
of the powers ni > 1) and (t ) = 1 if f (r) is even, and (t ) = 1 if f (r) is odd.

25

two further denitions are useful. the rst concerns the feet of a rooted
tree t . it is a subset f (t ) of t [0] provided by those vertices which have fertility
zero, hence no outgoing edges.

also, we let n (t ) be the set of those trees which are generated from t by

natural growth n (t )

t   n (t ) < zt , n (t ) >6= 0,

(121)

and counting multiplicities appropriately. see fig.(3) to get acquainted with all
these notions.

we want to derive the following three results. first,

n

t ! = xtf (t )

1
t! ,

which leads to the second result,

cm (t) =

n!
t!st

, t  t [n],

(122)

(123)

where the tree-factorials and connes-moscovici weights are dened as in [5].
finally,

cm (t )

t !

=

(n  1)!
2(n1) .

(124)

xt t [n]

we rst note that (122) obviously holds for trees t = bn

+(e), where it reduces
to the familiar n/n! = 1/(n  1)!. hence, the tree factorial is another example
of the replacement integers to rooted trees.

the next observation is

n
t! =

k

yj=1

1
t!
j

,

(125)

where b(t) = qk

j=1 tj. this identity is a mere way of writing the denition
of the tree factorial, using that any tree factorial factorizes n for a tree with n
vertices.

instead of proving (122), we prove

where we dene

n1 + . . . + nk

and t 
have been attached to some branch ti of b+(t1 . . . tk) which gives t 

i . . . tk) = t. thus, we use that the feet must
i  f(ti).

26

let us rst show that (122) is a consequence of (126). to see this, it suces

to note that

f (b+(t)) = {b+(t) | t  f(t)},

(128)

as obviously root and feet are dierent ends of a rooted tree. fig.(3) gives an
instructive example. hence, setting k = 1 in (126),

n

t! = xtf (b+(t))

1

b(t)! = xtf (t)

1
t! ,

which proves (122). 

it remains to prove (126). we have

in the above, the  means to omit the corresponding factor.

we are now in the position to prove (123). we assume it holds for trees with
n  1 vertices and simply reduce it to (122) to show that it holds for n vertices.

(133)

(134)

(135)

which is the desired result. 
it remains to prove (124). by the denition of the cm-weights as counting
multiplicities of trees under natural growth we can write

cm (t)

t!

xtt [n]

= xtt [n1]

cm (t)

(t)! xtn (t)

(t)!
(t)! .

(136)

27

hence we must show

(t)!
(t)! =

n  1

xtn (t)

then, (124) follows immediately by induction:

cm (t)

 xtt [n]

(137)

(138)

(139)

(140)

to derive (137) we write

(t)!
(t)! =

xtn (t)

n  1

n xtn (t) q(br(t))!
q(br(t))! ,

using the denition of the tree factorial via a product of the factorials of the
branches.

natural growth either happens at one of the branches of t, or at the root
n . in the former

of t. in the latter case, the above sum gives a contribution n1
case, assume natural growth happens at the branch t

i of t. then,

where t
i). hence, we can use induction in the above sum, as branches of
a tree have lesser vertices than the tree itself. thus, applying (137) for branches:

i  n (t

q(br(t))!
q(br(t))! =

(t

i )! ,
(t

. (143)

we used that the sum over all branches of t delivers n  2 vertices, as t has
n  1 vertices. thus, eq.(46) of [5] is proven.

6 operator product expansion

in a way, the most general problem one faces in qft can be stated as the
problem of nding the limit of matrix elements

lim
yx

< 0 | oa(x)ob(y)p (x1, . . .) | 0 >

fk(x  y) < 0 | ok((x + y)/2)p (x1, . . .) | 0 >,

(144)

=xk

28

where oa, ob, ok are operators and p (x1, . . .) is a polynomial in eld operators
at points x1, . . ., and we sum over all operators ok with appropriate quantum
numbers and wilson coecients fk. this is the problem of the operator product
expansion. the wilson coecients will behave as

fk(x  y)  (x  y)(da+dbdk)(polynomial in log(x  y)),

(145)

where da, db, dk are the dimensions of the operators oa, ob, ok.

viewed in momentum space, it becomes an renormalization problem: in the
desired limit, we will get a series of contributions which will be plagued by uv
divergences when we integrate momenta. hence, we can proceed as before and
sort the resulting contributions by their tree-structure, followed by a renormal-
ization based on the antipode of the resulting trees. the convolution product
extends to the coecient functions fk and one thus nds that the convolution
product of iterated integral is a simple representation of the convolution which
describes the change of scales in opes. this motivated the title of this paper.
the relation between a convolution of the form (74) and the ope is most
clearly understood if one considers the ope as a problem of the change of
renormalization conditions, hence a problem of the change of scales, in our
terminology. it is the standard practice in opes to nd the desired expansion
by doing the necessary subtractions for the case x = y, which means to nd a
larger set of appropriate forests [11, 12].

let us essentially restrict to 4 theory and consider the problem

(x)(y) = f (x  y)2((x + y)/2) + o((x  y)2).

(146)

lim
xy

one starts with the renormalized function

z ddqeiq(xy)(q, {pk})

(147)

associated to the vev (144). here, {pk} indicates the external momenta associ-
ated to the points xi in (144) after fourier transform, and q is the momentum
according to the fourier transform of x  y. (q, {pk}) is a renormalized am-
putated green function in momentum space (the grey blob in fig.(4)), dressed
with two extra propagators to connect it to x and y.

the corresponding feynman integrand can be either read as belonging to a
(n+ 2)-point green function g[n+2] or to a n-point green function with inserted
operator 2, g[n]
2 . the elements of h which we shall associate to either case
will be dierent.

in the former case, before the limit x  y is taken, the renormalized green
function g[n+2] is a well-dened nite ratio for a xed renormalization scheme
r. now, we want to change this ratio in accord with a new renormaliza-
tion condition which demands that the amputated greens function vanishes

for p(q2)  , so that the momentum integral over q in (147) exists. note

figure 4: the operator product expansion amounts to a renormalization of a
green function such that the limit x  y is well dened.
it amounts to a
change in renormalization conditions such that the fourier integral over q can
be carried out for y  x.

that it would be log-divergent if the amputated greens function has a nite
value for q2  .

this is a typical change achieved by a convolution product described in (74).
the renormalized green function associated with the operator insertion, g[n]
,
2
is obtained by convoluting g[n+2] with the ratio which takes into account the
change of renormalization conditions.

clearly, as the convolution of two ratios is a ratio, we can describe the so
obtained function as a sum over forests. the leading term x = y is explicitely
singled out in fig.(4).

again, a more detailed description of this approach is mainly a notational

exercise and will be given elsewhere.

7 comments, conclusions

in this paper we emphasized the common algebraic structure of iterated integrals
and renormalized green functions in pqft. both full a group law derived
from the underlying hopf algebra structure. the shue product of iterated
integrals allows to restrict the hopf algebra to hchen, while green functions
represent the full hopf algebra of decorated rooted trees. typical properties of

30

renormalization like rges and opes can be derived from this group law. the
notational exercise to make this explicit will be presented in future work. here
we presented only the conceptual foundations of renormalization theory.

we argued that all renormalization schemes can be treated on the same
footing, and gave explicit examples for the case of one-loop decorations. two
renormalization schemes play a distinguished role: on-shell schemes (momentum
schemes in a massless theory) which serve as the general mediator for arbitrary
changes of the renormalization point in any choosen scheme and the minimal
subtraction scheme which annihilates scale independent quantities from the be-
ginning.

a hope is that the analytic structure of green functions will become coherent
in a manner inspired by the study of the polylogarithm and multiple zeta values
and the structures observed there, ranging from the k-z equations and iterated
integrals to hopf algebras and, eventually, singular knot invariants and weight
systems. the enormous progress in mathematics in recent years [13], so far being
mainly related to topological qfts, will hopefully enrich our understanding of
qft in four dimensions eventually. recent results concerning counterterms of
feynman diagrams [14] as well as analytic structures of green functions [15]
justify some hope.

one thing we have not considered here: non-trivial renormalization schemes
establsih algebraic structures on v which weaken the structure of a proper hopf
algebra [2]. as this paper is already quite long, we will describe the resulting
weak hopf algebra structure in more detail in forthcoming work [16].

let us close this paper with one nal observation which shows the urgent
need to work out the connection between renormalization and ncg [3] in more
detail. using the results of section ve we write for a rooted tree t with n
vertices

.

(148)

1
t! =

st cm (t)

n!

plugging this into the model of section four (see [5] to nd such models coming
from realistic qfts), we nd

gz(t; x) = bt(x)znx =

1
t!xn ft(x)znx

(149)

where we factored out the pole parts such that f (0) = 1. summing over all
trees we obtain

xn xtt [n]

gz(t; x) =xn

1
n!

fn (x)[

zx
x

]n,

(150)

where fn (x) =ptt [n] cm (t)stft(x) is the natural representative of the natu-

ral grown n, a nice result in the light of [3, 4], emphasizing that renormalization
almost (by the deviation of r from id) inverts bare green functions in the group
assigned to h in the nal section of [3].
