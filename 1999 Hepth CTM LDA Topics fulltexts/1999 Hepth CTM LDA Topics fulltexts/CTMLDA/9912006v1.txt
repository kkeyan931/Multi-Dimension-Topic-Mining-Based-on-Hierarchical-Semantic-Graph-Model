explicit construction of constrained instantons

department of physics, university of southern denmark, odense university, denmark

(received 1 december, 1999)

morten nielsen, n.k. nielsen.

instantons in massless theories do not carry over to massive theories due to derricks theorem.
this theorem can, however, be circumvented, if a constraint that restricts the scale of the instanton
is imposed on the theory. constrained instantons are considered in four dimensions in 4 theory
and su (2) yang-mills-higgs theory. in each of these theories a calculational sceme is set up and
solved in the lowest few orders in the mass parameter in such a way that the need for a constraint
is exhibited clearly. constrained instantons are shown to exist as nite action solutions of the eld
equations with exponential fall o only for specic constraints that are unique in lowest order in the
mass parameter in question.

i. introduction

instantons have been prominent tools for the computa-
tion of nonperturbative eects in classically conformally
invariant eld theories including gauge theories since the
pioneering achievements of belavin et al. [1] and t hooft
[2]. in the presence of mass, including mass generation
because of spontaneous symmetry breaking, instantons
leading to a nite action do not exist as a consequence
of a generalization of derricks theorem [3]. however, as
pointed out by frishman and yankielowicz [4] and af-
eck [5], a nite action solution of the eld theory in
question can be obtained if a constraint is imposed on
the theory restricting the scale of the instantons to be
small compared to the inverse mass parameter.

since then, constrained instantons have enjoyed con-
siderable attention [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. however,
little consideration has been given to a systematic ex-
plicit analytic construction of constrained instantons.

in the present paper, a detailed account is given of
the explicit construction of constrained instantons in the
context of the two models also considered in [5], viz. 4
theory with a negative potential, and su (2) yang-mills-
higgs theory. the latter example is especially interesting
because of its relevance for the standard model of elec-
troweak unication. the constructions in the two models
are carried out recursively in the mass parameters, fol-
lowing the pattern indicated in [5] and in such a way that
the constrained instanton solutions at short distances do
not contain singularities spoiling the niteness of the ac-
tions, while their large-distance behavior is determined
by the modied bessel function k1, thus ensuring the
exponential fall o familiar from massive eld theories.

for 4 theory we nd that the only way to achieve
this goal is by means of a constraint cubic in the eld
or by having a similar constraint through a source term
in the eld equation, while other constraints only de-
pending on the eld are ruled out because they lead to
singular behavior of the constrained instanton solution at
the origin. for the yang-mills-higgs theory exponential
fall o at innity can be obtained by adjustment of in-
tegration constants, but a constraint is necessary for the
yang-mills eld in order to ensure absence of singulari-
ties of the constrained instanton at small distances that
prevent the action from being nite. no modication of
the higgs eld equation is necessary.

the important point about the analysis of the present
paper is that the accomplishment of a good constraint is
twofold: it should

1. restrict the scale parameter of the instanton solu-

tion, and

2. ensure that the instanton solution leads to a nite

action

and 1. is a necessary but by no means sucient condition
for 2. in fact, as we shall demonstrate, most constraints
that ensure 1.
lead to constrained instanton solutions
that are singular at the origin in such a way that 2. is vi-
olated. in lowest order in the mass parameter it is found
that the form of the constraint is uniquely xed, whereas
there is considerable freedom to choose the constraint in
higher orders.

the paper is organized in the following way: in sec. ii
the scalar 4 theory is considered. lowest-order correc-
tions to the instanton solutions due to a mass parameter
and constraint terms are calculated explicitly in sec. ii a
and ii b, and in these sections also a leading-term anal-
ysis is carried out to all orders in the mass parameter,
showing that the constrained instanton solution leads to
a nite action and has exponential fall o at large dis-
tances. this argument is completed in sec.
ii c and
extended to subleading terms in sec. ii d. in sec. iii a
corresponding analysis is carried out for the yang-mills-
higgs theory. in sec. iii a conditions for niteness of the

1

action are obtained, and in sec. iii b explicit solutions
of the eld equations are found by iteration up to fourth
order in the mass parameter. in sec. iii c a leading or-
der analysis is carried out on similar lines as in the scalar
case. in secs. iii d, iii e and iii f a constraint leading
to the desired properties of the solution is constructed. in
the course of this construction also the subleading terms
are considered. finally the connection to the t hooft
integral measure is established in sec. iii g.

ii. scalar 4 theory

in this section we consider an euclidean 4 theory with

a solution of (3) is

1 = 3m2(cid:20)(cid:18)1 + t 
t(cid:19) 
(1 + t)2 (cid:18) 1

+6

1 + t

1 + t(cid:19) log
+ 9(cid:21) .

12

1 + t

(5)

to this solution may be added a term proportional to the
zero mode t(1t)
(1+t)2 .

in the limit t   (x  0) the solution behaves as a

constant

1  103m2

(6)

negative 4 term. the lagrangian is

l =

g (cid:18) 1

2

()2 +

m22

4!

4(cid:19) .

in the massless case the eld equation has an instanton
solution 0:

20 +

1

3
0 = 0, 0 =

43
2 + x2 .

(2)

here and elsewhere  is a scale parameter characterizing
the instanton solution. the equation governing small
deviations  from this solution has the zero mode 
 0.

a. mass corrections

take the mass m to be small but non-zero. this is
expected to give rise to a small deviation 1 from the
massless solution. it is convenient to introduce the vari-
able t = 2
x2 in terms of which the equation obeyed by 1
is

(cid:18) d2
dt2 +

6

t(1 + t)2(cid:19) 1 = 3m2

.

(3)

the operator on the left-hand side has a zero mode t(1t)
(1+t)2
corresponding to 
 0. introducing the spence function
[12] [13] by 

(x) =z x

0

du
u

log(1 + u)

(4)

the litterature contains several denitions of the spence
function, diering mutually by signs and additive constants.
we have found the denition of (4) most convenient. it leads
to the following identity:

(t) + (

1
t

) 

1
2

log2

t =

6

.

which may be modied by a nite amount by adding to
the solution a multiple of the zero mode. in the opposite
limit, t  0 (x  ), the outcome is

(1)

3m2 log

1

t  33m2

1 

(7)

that is unaected by the zero mode.

next consider higher order mass corrections by itera-

tion of the equation

(2  m2) = 

3

1
6

(8)

in the mass parameter m2. we are mainly concerned
with the asymptotic behavior in the regimes x  0 and
x  . at x  0 the mass corrections must be nite
while at x   the leading mass corrections should sum
to

43

m
x

k1(mx),

(9)

with k1 a modied bessel function, thus ensuring expo-
nential fall o of the instanton solution for large x accord-
ing to (a5). the factor in front is found by comparison
with the massless instanton solution (2). exponential
fall o of the subleading terms also has to be achieved
somehow. this problem will be considered in sec. ii d.
writing the solution of (8) as a power series in m2 with
the term proportional to m2n denoted n, we observe
from (2) the following behavior of 0 at large x:

43
x2

,

0 

(10)

while 1 in this limit is given by (7). thus it stands to
reason that the leading terms to power m2n are propor-
tional to m2n(x2)n1 (for power-counting purposes loga-
rithmic factors of x and m can be disregarded, as will be
clear in the course of our argument). that this is indeed
the case is proven by induction by means of (8), which is
equivalent to:

2n  m2n1 = 

1

6 x1+2+3=n

1 2 3 .

(11)

assuming

b. constraint corrections

i  m2i(x2)i1, i < n

(12)

we nd that the term on the right-hand side involving
n is negligible compared to the rst term on the left-
hand side, whereas the terms not involving n are domi-
nated by the second term on the left-hand side. thus, to
leading order the right-hand side of (8) can be safely ne-
glected. it then follows that if (12) is valid to order n 1
then it also holds to order n, and hence to all orders by
induction.

eq.(8) with the nonlinear term on the right-hand
side disregarded is the klein-gordon equation in four-
dimensional euclidean space. consequently the solution
is a linear combination of m
x k1(mx), with
i1 and k1 modied bessel functions of the rst and the
second kind, respectively (see appendix a). by com-
parison of (a2) and (a3), which for small values of mx
implies:

x i1(mx) and m

(14)

from (a4) it is seen that the last term of (14) has expo-
nential growth at x  . thus this term prevents our
solution from being a nite action solution. this problem
is expected according to the analysis of [5] and is solved
by imposing a constraint on the solution.

at x  0 it was found in (2) and (6) that 0 and 1 are
regular. it follows from (8) that all higher order terms
are regular in this limit order by order in m2. to see
this we rewrite the dierential equation determining n
in terms of the variable t = 2
x2 , obtaining an asymptotic
equation of the form

(

d2
dt2 +

6

t(1 + t)2 )h(t) = tk, k  3.

(15)

the solution of this equation is

h(t) = const 

t(1  t)
(1 + t)2 +

1

k(k  1)

t2k + o(t1k) (16)

where the rst term on the right-hand side originates
from the zero-mode. this solution, and consequently n,
approaches a constant for t  . in this way it follows
by induction that the solution of (8) is nite for x  0
to all orders in m2.

3

eq. (8) should now be modied in such a way that the
i1-term in (14) is eliminated while the regular behavior
at x  0 is kept. according to the prescription of [5] this
should be achieved by introducing a constraint.

with a constraint

z d4xn(x) = c4n

(17)

with n = 3 or n  5 a positive integer, the rst order
equation corresponding to (3) is

(cid:18)2 +

1
2

2

0(cid:19) 1 = n(0)n1.

(18)

here c and  are constants. the case n = 4 is excluded
(the constraint in this case does not break scale invari-
ance, and this is a nessesary condition for a nite action
instanton solution to exist).

for n = 3 the solution is trivial:

1 = 6

(19)

this solution can be used to modify (7) in such a way
that the unwanted i1-term of (14) disappears, so in this
case one indeed obtains a constrained instanton with an
exponential fall o at large distances. the details are
given below in sec. ii c.

introducing the variable u = t

1+t and dening

f =

43(cid:19)n1

(20)

one converts (18) into an inhomogeneous hypergeometric
equation

+ 6(cid:19) f = un3 , n  3.

(21)

for completeness the solution is determined also in the
case n = 4:

1

and for n  5 the solution is:

f =

(22)

f =

n  4

n(n  1)(n  2)



xi=n2

(i + 3)(i + 2)

i(i  1)

ui+1.

(23)

to these solutions may be added an arbitrary multiple of
the zero-mode t(1t)

(1+t)2 = u(1  2u).

in the case n  5 the terms in the innite series tend
from above to a geometric series for large i, and hence
the expression diverges in the limit u  1, i. e. x  0:

lim
u1

(1  u)f (u) =

n  4

n(n  1)(n  2)

.

(24)

in consequence, we have found the following behavior of
1 in the case n  5 :
1(x)  0 for x  ,
43(cid:19)1n
1(x) 

1
x2 for x  0.

4 (cid:18) 

(n  1)(n  2)

n  4

(25)

in this case the constraint corrections lead to a singular
behavior of the instanton at x  0, invalidating aecks
equation (2.7) in [5]. it is instructive to see this in detail.
in order to compare (25) with eq. (2.7) in aecks

paper we use the following identity :



z d4x(cid:18) 0
=z d4x(cid:18) 0

 (cid:19)
21  12 0
  1(cid:19) = 







z d4x (0)n .

and the solution is consequently singular for x  0. this
situation is similar to what was encountered for the con-
straint (17) with n  5. thus all these constraints must
be rejected.
another type of constraint, suggested by frishman and
yankielowicz [4], corresponds to having an equation of
the form

(cid:18)u(1  u)

d2
du2  2u

d
du

+ 6(cid:19) f = (u  u0) , n  3

(29)

with u0 a constant between 0 and 1 and (u  u0) the
dirac -function. in this case one also expects f (u) to be
singular at u = 1. in order to prove this one can smear
the constraint with a test function g(u0) and obtains then
the situation considered previously.

(26)

c. construction of nite action constrained

instanton

to obtain the last version of (26) we used that 0
zero mode, as well as (18).

 is a

the last version of (26) is nonvanishing. rewriting the
middle version by means of gauss theorem and assuming
that there is no contribution from a surface near the ori-
gin one would conclude, following aeck, that 1 goes
as a nonvanishing constant for x  .
however, it follows from (25) that a contribution ac-
tually arises from a surface near the origin. this means
that 1 need not go as a constant for x  , and indeed
it vanishes in this limit according to (25).
in the preceding paragraps we only considered con-
straints that are monomials in the eld . for more
generalized constraints the equation (21) is replaced by

(cid:18)u(1  u)

d2
du2  2u

d
du

+ 6(cid:19) f (u) = g(u)

(27)

where g(u) is some function. if g(u) can be expressed as a
power series it follows from the analysis of the preceding
section that the solution is singular for x  0 unless g(u)
only contains terms linear in u or constant.

one example is the constraint [5]

z d4x()n = c44n

which leads to the following inhomogeneous hypergeo-
metric equation

d
du

d2
du2  2u

(cid:18)u(1  u)
+ 6(cid:19) f (u)
= 2(1 + n)u3n2(1  u)n1
+6(n  1)u3n3(1  u)n , n  2

(28)

replacing (21). here the right-hand side can be written
as a power series in u with cubic and higher-order terms,

4

in sec. ii a it was found that the leading terms of the
solution sum to the result given in (14) where the last
term, having exponential growth at x  , prevents the
solution from being a nite action solution and should be
eliminated by means of a constraint.

for a constraint represented by a term in the action of

the form

(cid:18)z d4x3(x)  c(cid:19) ,

(30)

the constraint can be used to modify (7) in such a way
that the unwanted i1-term of (14) disappears, so in this
case one indeed obtains a constrained instanton with an
exponential fall o at large distances. comparing (7) to
(13) we see from (19) that if we x the lagrange multi-
plier according to  =  with

3
6

 =

m2(cid:18)log

m22

4

+ 2 + 2(cid:19)

we have

1 + 1 

3m2(cid:18)log

m2x2

4

+ 2  1(cid:19) .

(31)

(32)

this is exactly 43 m

x k1(mx) to this order.

with (30) added to the action and the lagrange
multiplier  taking the value (31) one now obtains
43 m
x k1(mx) by summation of the leading terms to
all orders in the mass parameter. this follows from:

 the analysis of sec. ii a is unaected by an extra
term proportional to m22 on the right-hand side
of the eld equation; the leading terms at large x
still obey the klein-gordon equation.

 m
x i1(mx) only contains a constant term in lowest
order (order m2); thus if the constant is removed
and the lowest-order term of m
x i1(mx) thus is ab-
sent then all the higher-order terms must also be
absent.

the conclusion is that for a constraint (30) with  given
by (31) the sum of the leading terms has exponential fall
o at large distances. the analysis of sec. ii a on the
niteness of the solution at small distances is easily seen
to be unaected by the constraint.

d. leading vs. subleading terms

eq. (14) valid for x   was found in a leading term
approximation, where only leading powers in x2 were
kept. it should be checked that these leading terms are
still leading after summation. as was demonstrated in
sec. ii c, the i1-term is removed by the constraint (30).
the leading terms by themselves grow faster the higher
the order, but they conspire to a sum with exponential
fall o. it is thus not a priori clear that the nonleading
terms are still nonleading after summation. as we shall
demonstrate, the sum of the nonleading terms also have
exponential fall o at large distances.

the eld equation

(2  m2) +

1
6

3  32 = 0

(33)

has in leading order at large distances the approximate
solution (9), denoted (1), that is proportional to a mas-
sive scalar propagator and is of rst order in  (hence
the bracketed superscript). the nextleading term (3) in
this approximation scheme is a solution of the equation

(2  m2)(3) = 

1
6

((1))3 + 6

1
2

((1))2.

(34)

the leading terms are of the form m2n(x2)n1, n  0
and possibly with a logarithmic factor. the nextleading
terms are correspondingly of the form m2n(x2)n2, n  0
and again possibly with a logarithmic factor. by inspec-
tion of (34) it is seen that the terms on the right-hand
side are of the form m2n(x2)n3, so (3) is indeed the
sum of the nextleading terms.

it is seen from (34) that one can write (3) as a convo-
lution integral involving only massive propagators. thus
(3) also falls o exponentially at large distances. con-
tinuing this approximation scheme one nds equations
similar to (34) with the klein-gordon operator operat-
ing on (2n+1) on the left-hand side and an expression
involving previously found (1), (3),  , (2n1) on the
right-hand side. hence (2n+1) can be expressed as a
convolution integral involving only massive propagators
as well and exponential fall o at innity is ensured to
each order.

in sec. ii c a nite action solution was obtained by
having the constraint (30). having instead a constraint

(cid:18)z d4x32

0(x)(x)  c(cid:19)

(35)

clearly allows the same conclusion, but only to leading or-
der. the extra term in the eld equation is now a source
term instead of an expression quadratic in the eld. in
the equation corresponding to (34) this means that the
constraint induced term contains massless propagators.
this in turn means that (3) has a fall o at innity
according to a power law.

it is clearly desirable that the subleading terms have
exponential fall o like the leading terms. this can be
obtained also with a constraint leading to a source term
in the eld equation. the reason is that the constant 
in front of the source term is of second order in the mass.

it is thus possible to use a constraint r d4x 2(x)(x),

with

 = 0 + 

and where the higher-order terms are adjusted order by
order such that  =  with  the solution obtained by
means of the constraint (30). in this way a source term
constraint gives the same constrained instanton as a term
corresponding to an extra term in the lagrangian that is
cubic in the scalar eld.

constraints corresponding to a source term in the eld

equation were originally suggested by wang [9].

iii. yang-mills-higgs instanton

an analysis of the su(2) yang-mills-higgs theory sim-
ilar to that of the 4 theory is carried out in this section.
the euclidean lagrangian is

these equations are solved order by order in  in such
a way that the solution leads to a nite action.
it is
assumed that terms in  are of even order, while terms in
f are of odd order in . the exponential decay at innity
can be ensured by tuning of the integration constants in
the rst few orders, while integrability of the lagrangian
density at the origin requires modication of the above
equations corresponding to a constraint.

(42)

(43)

0 = 1 + t

(49)

one obtains the following estimate at small t-values:

log   (t + 2 + 4 + ) 

1

(t + 2 + 4 + )2 +  .
(50)

to ensure the exponential decay at small t-values one
should express the rst bracket in this expression by the
modied bessel function k1. to make log  behave order
by order as a power series expansion of m
x k1(mx) with
m some mass parameter we have to require absence of
inverse powers of t in 2, while 4 only is allowed to
have a 1/t-term etc. similar considerations apply to f .
thus the leading terms should in the limit t  0 conspire
to modied bessel funtions according to

 = 0 + 2 + 4 +   1 +
for f the appropriate condition turns out to be

a. conditions for niteness of the action

with the elds only depending on the norm x = |x|

(52)

as demonstrated explicitly in sec. iii c.

to investigate the integrability at the origin of the la-

grangian density (44) one rst considers:

(44)

(45)

(46)

the lagrangian is negative semi-denite since the square
bracket in (44) can be expressed as a sum of squares.
thus the condition for a nite action is that each term
in the sum gives a nite contribution separately.

f and log  should at large x-values decrease exponen-

tially. writing

and similarly

f = f1 + f3 + f5 +

from which it is deduced that to keep a0a2 integrable at
the origin one can at most allow 2 to go as t log t at large
t. if this condition is fullled then the second square of
(44) is integrable at the origin to second order as well.

in fourth order both squares contain two terms.

if
there is a term t log t present in 2 then a2
2 is not inte-
grable at the origin; it contains a term quadratic in t.
this must be cancelled by the other fourth order term in
a2. to determine a0a4 one nds from (45):

with the indices enumerating the power of the mass pa-

+(

to ensure a nite integral of a2 to fourth order there must
be present in 4 a term quadratic in t. now examine the
second square of (44) in a similar way. it is found that

t  a2(cid:17)2
(cid:16) b22

is integrable at the origin, whereas

(cid:18) b02

t  a0(cid:19)(cid:18) b42

t  a4(cid:19)

(57)

is nite upon integration only if 4 diverges no faster
than t log t. thus we conclude that to have a nite ac-
tion it is necessary to demand that 2 diverges at most
logarithmically for large values of the variable t. contin-
uing this analysis to higher orders reveals that 2n can
at most diverge logarithmically at large t for all n > 0.

from the third square in (44) it follows immediately
that f can also at most grow as log t for t  . this
also ensures the integrability at the origin of the nal two
terms in (44), and thus of the entire lagrangian.

(62)

the integration constant c2;2 is taken equal 3c2;1 (a dif-

the terms 1

for a nite action solution according to the discussion

in this section the eld equations are solved order by
order in the mass parameter . in each order it is ex-
amined whether this solution has exponential fall o at
innity, as well as integrability of the lagrangian density
at the origin, following the considerations of the previous
section. we start by rewriting (42) and (43) in terms of
the parameter t = 2

(65)

(66)

the equations can then in each step be solved by quadra-
ture. the integration constants arising this way are de-
noted ci;j where the rst subscript indicates the order
and the second subscript is an extra label.

1. orders zero, one, two and three

to order zero the solution of (58) is (49), corresponding
to the massless instanton in the singular gauge, while to
rst order one obtains the following solution of (59)

f1 =

c1;11 + t

+ c1;2(1 + t)

3

2 .

(60)

it is necessary to choose c1;2 = 0 in order to keep f1
bounded for x  0. a similar term will arise in each
order and must always be chosen equal to zero. eq. (60)
reduces for c1;1 =  to the isospin 1
2 zero mode [2]. it
will be shown that this value of c1;1 is enforced by the
boundary conditions.

7

the mass parameter m in the modied bessel function
is for c1;1 =  actually equal to mvec, the vector mass
generated by the higgs eld (36).

the modication of (58) as displayed in (63) is an in-
dication of the necessity of a constraint in the sense of
[5]. however, it should be emphasized that the modi-
cation is unique to second order in the mass parameter
. any other modication will either cause 2 to behave
dierently from the modied bessel function k1 at inn-
ity, since it will modify the coecient of the log t-term
or introduce more singular terms for t  0, or it will give
rise to nonintegrable singularities of the action density at
the origin. this point is further elaborated upon in sec.
iii d.

with m some mass parameter. the small m-expansion of
the bessel function (13) is used for the determinination
of c3;1 and c1;1. the mass parameter is also xed this
way. making a small-t expansion of f1 one nds

f1 = c1;1

a similar problem was encountered for 2 where it led
to the modied dierential equation (63). modifying the
dierential equation (75) in the same way means remov-
ing from its right-hand side the terms on the right-hand

and here bessel function behavior of the solution at large
distances has been obtained by a suitable choice of the
integration constants.

c. limit considerations

next (58) and (59) are examined in the limits where
t  0 and t   in order to reach some conclusion
which are valid to all orders in the mass, in the same
way as in sec. ii a. in these limits the equations simplify
suciently to allow a leading term analysis.

1. t  0

here it is checked by induction that the leading terms
of  and f in powers of t conspire to give the modied
bessel function k1 according to (51) and (52). more
specically, it will be checked that these expressions agree
with the leading terms in the eld equations. 0 is given
in (49) while f1 at large distances behaves according to
(69). the induction hypothesis is

n  t1 n

2 , n > 0 , fn  t

3

2  n

2 , n > 1.

(85)

9

this hypothesis is correct for n = 2, 3, 4 according to (66)
(with c1;1 = ), (67) and (78). we want to prove it by
induction for n > 4 and to show that the leading terms
sum to (51) and (52).

for n  2 one of the leading terms includes a logarith-
mic factor, but this makes no dierence in what follows
since it does not aect the estimate of the power behavior
after dierentiation.

keeping only the leading terms for t  0 one gets from
(58) to order n in the mass parameter, with the induction
hypothesis used in orders lower than n:

22

dn2

t3 d2n

d
dt

dt2 
correct to order t1 n
2 . this relation proves the estimate
for n in (85). after summation over n this corresponds

(86)

dt

8

exactly to (cid:16)2  2

2 (cid:17)   = 0 which is solved by (51).

as seen in ii a this does not guarantee exponential fall
o; also exponential rise is possible, unless a particular
solution is picked in low orders. however, the require-
ments necessary for obtaining the desired asymptotic be-
havior of the full solution have been met in the present
case by the choice of integration constants in sec. iii b
and by modifying the second-order equation according to
(63).

for n = 2 and n = 4 the leading terms are of order
t0 and t1, respectively. in each of these cases (86) only
contains a nonlogarithmic term, and the equation only
restricts the logarithmic parts of the leading terms; the
nonlogarithmic parts have to be xed by adjustment of
integration constants, as we saw in sec. iii b. however,
for n > 4 the situation is dierent. here the left-hand
side of (86) is of order t1 n
2 and contains in each case
both a logarithmic and a nonlogarithmic term, and both
the logarithmic and the nonlogarithmic part of n is de-
termined by the equation. consequently, no further ad-
justment is necessary to produce (51) as the only solution
of (86) after summation over n, and no restrictions on the
integration constants cn;1 occur at these orders.

as an example we will use (86) to determine the leading
terms of 6. keeping only the leading terms in 4 (which
are of order t1) as given in (78) we nd the equation

d26
dt2 

366

1024t4 (cid:18)log

22

8t

+ 2 

5

2(cid:19) .

this is integrated to give the result

6 

366

6144t2 (cid:18)log

22

8t

+ 2 

10

3 (cid:19) .

(87)

(88)

comparing this to (a3) we nd that 6 is indeed the sixth
order term in 2 mvec
x k1(mvecx). note that this result is
obtained without tuning the integration constants.

next the same analysis is applied to (59). the equation

obeyed by the leading terms is to order n:

d2fn
dt2 

22
4t3 fn2

(89)

correct to order t 1
2 , which matches (52) with (59),
and the choice of integration constants in low orders xes
the asymptotic behavior according to (52).

2  n

2. t  

in this limit it is checked that n, n 6= 0, and tfn

diverge at most logarithmically. this has already been
proven in sec. iii b in the cases n = 2, 3, 4. for n > 4
the statement is demonstrated by induction.

for n > 4 the induction hypothesis in combination

with (58) leads to

d

dt2 
dt2 + (cid:19)(cid:19) = o(t4).

d2n4

34
1 + t

d2n4

dt2

(90)

the induction hypothesis implies that all terms on the
left-hand side excluding the rst one are at most o(t4).
thus, rewriting this equation after the rst integration:

d2n

t (cid:19)3
dt2  o(t3) + cn;1(cid:18) 1 + t

(91)

one sees that the terms cn;1( 3
t + 1) give rise to unwanted
terms in n of the form cn;1(3t log t + 1
2 t2). similar un-
wanted terms were discarded from 2 and 4, leading to
the modied equation (83) instead of (58) for the deter-
mination of , with the constant  given by (84). this
procedure can also be applied here, with the same conclu-
sion. the argument shows that the o(6) terms of  are
arbitrary since they are given by the arbitrary constants
cn;1.

similarly, upon examining equation (59) at order n one
obtains from the induction hypothesis that keeping only
the leading terms we can disregard all terms of order t 3
and thus we are left with
(1 + t)2 d2fn

fn = o(t 3
2 )

(92)

2

dt2 

3
4

whence

fn

(1 + t)

= o(t2).

(93)

thus, tfn can diverge at most logarithmically, and the
proof by induction is completed.

requires no modication. in the light of this, it should be
investigated which types of constraints can lead to this
modication.

several gauge-invariant constraints have been consid-
ered in the litterature. two of these are examined and
shown to lead to an innite action. the yang-mills eld
equation with the general expression for the constraint

modication r d4xo included in the action is:
 z d4xo

2(cid:0)32(cid:1) + 
a
= 

  log 

f 2 a

aa

(94)

with  a suitable constant.

ered:

(96)

 x(cid:18) t

 z d4xok = 

1 + t(cid:19)7
inserting this into the eld equation (94) gives the equa-
tion for 2 where we have substituted 2  2
0 in the
constraint term:
dt (cid:18) t

1 + t(cid:19)3 d22

k t5
(1 + t)9 =

(97)

with k a constant of order 2. it is impossible, with
this equation determining 2, to eliminate both the term
1
2 c2;1t2 and 3c2;1t log t in (61), which is necessary for a
nite action solution, and still have bessel function be-
havior at innity, so this constraint must be rejected.

similarly, the constraint used by aoyama et al. [10] is

considered:

d. modied equations

in secs. iii b and iii c it was found that in order to
obtain a nite action solution of eqs. (58) and (59) that
reduces to the usual instanton in the massless limit, one
must modify the eld equation (58) to (83), while (59)

that again leads to an innite action.

the question is now whether it is possible at all to
obtain the modied equations from an action principle
with a lagrangian density expressed only in terms of the
eld variables aa
 and . the immediate diculty here is
that the equation is formulated in terms of the variable

10

 and not the gauge potential aa
this we decompose aa

 as follows:

formulas are equivalent for

(108)

with

(102)

the ansatz (41) is regained if one sets  = 0 and aa =
0.
the yang-mills eld equation can be obtained by in-
sertion of (101) into the lagrangian (36), if one takes
variation of (36) with respect to log  (or ),  and aa
,
and next sets  = 0 and aa = 0. since the constrained
instanton is expressed in terms of , the eld components
 and aa act as lagrange multiplier elds as far as the
formulation of the constraint goes. thus the dicult part
of the construction of a good constraint concerns the part
of the constraint involving only .

thus we learn that we want to add a term sconst to the
action (the subscript const indicates constraint) such
that

with 2 the part of  as given in (84) that is of second

eq.

(105) contains two partial derivatives. conse-

quently sconst can contain the term sa with

sa =z g()d4x

(107)

that is compared with (105) in lowest order in the mass
variable, where the procedure leading to (97) and (100)

the elds  and aa only have to enter the constraint
linearly. this is accomplished if one adds to the action a
term sb with

where the lagrange multiplier  should be xed to .

the constraint (110) does not have a very convenient
form since it is desirable that the twelve components of
the gauge eld enter the constraint on the same foot-
ing. we have not succeeded in constructing a good con-
straint with this property. obvious candidates like (97)
and (100) fail to produce a nite action.

e. a constraint that almost works

instead of a constraint involving the eld variables
alone it is also possible, as pointed out by wang [9], to
use a source-type constraint, where the whole quantum
eld enters the constraint linearly.

in order to obtain a pure source term in the modied
yang-mills eld equation, one should adjust the extra
term in (83), converting it into:

dt(cid:18)3t3 d2
2 d

dt2 (cid:19) 

3t

2(1 + t)2 =

2
8

f 21 d
dt

.

(111)

this is accomplished if one adds to the action a term

sconst =  (prov[a]  c)

(112)

where prov[a] is dened by

prov[a] = 12z d4xaa

 a



2x

x2(x2 + 2)2

(113)

and where the lagrange multiplier  should be xed to
 (this provisional constraint will be completed in sec.
iii f). comparing prov to the massless instanton solu-
tion (40) one nds

1. modied limit considerations

since we have swapped 0 for  in (111) compared to
(83) we have to check that the limit considerations of sec.
iii c still hold true. orders zero and two are exactly as
in sec. iii b but something new appears in the fourth
order equation:

the 2-term is new, so we must verify that this new term
does not ruin the integrability at the origin or the bessel
function behavior at innity. in the limit t  0 the new
in the other
term goes as t log t which is subleading.
limit, t  , this term vanishes as t3 so it can only
give allowed logarithmic contributions to 4. this anal-
ysis shows again that the constrained instanton solution
is uniquely determined up to o(3) but ambiguous in
higher orders. to a general order n > 4 one can perform
the analysis carried out in connection with (115) with the
same conclusion.

thus, by adding to the action (112) one nds a solution
to the modied eld equations with a nite action, and
which gives the massless instanton in the   0 limit.

f. leading vs. subleading terms

until now the exponential fall o at innity valid to
all orders in the mass only takes into account the lead-
ing terms to each order. an analysis similar to that of
(ii d) is carried out in this section showing that when
the sum of the leading terms vanishes exponentially in
the limit x  , then so does the sum of the subleading
terms, provided that the constraint is modied such that
the constraint term of the eld equation explicitly shows
exponential fall o.

the nal form of the yang-mills eld equation (42)
including the extra term from sec. iii e multiplied with
an exponential factor is taken as:

2  32 


2

f 2  = 2s.

(116)

where we dene the source s :

s = 

122x
x2(x2 + 2)2 ekm2

vecx2

(117)

with k an arbitrary real positive number. the higgs
eld equation (43) is unchanged. this gives the following
equations for the nextleading terms

(119)

this modication follows if (112) is added to the action
in a form where the integrand in (113) is multiplied by
the exponential factor ekm2
. the nal form of the
constraint functional is thus

[a] = 12z d4xaa a

(120)

as was the case in sec. iii e one again has to check
that the limit considerations of sec. iii c still are valid.
in-
in the limit x   there is exponential fall o.
deed, this was the reason why the exponential factor was
in the other limit, x  0,
inserted in the rst place.
the extra exponential factor becomes unity and thus this
constraint also ensures a nite action.

[a] can be calculated order by order as the equation

for  is solved. in zeroth order:

0 = 362

while to second order
2 = 122 22

+ 2 + 2 + 12k(cid:19) .

(122)

picking a value of the constant c obviously xes the scale
parameter  according to:

362 + 122 22

8 (cid:18)log

+o(44) = c.

taking here

22

8

+ 2 + 2 + 12k(cid:19)

(123)

c = 362(1 + )

(124)

with 0 <  << 1 one obtains a transcendental equation
the solution of which expresses  in terms of  in such a
way that  << 1. in this way the choice of the constant
c xes the scale.

that one adds to (78) in order to obtain the asymptotic

consequently of the factor 4 in front of the fourth-order
constraint, vanishes for k chosen according to

2. an alternative approach

writing the constraint term of (58) as is suggested in

(131)

one can check that the subleading terms vanish exponen-
tially. this form of the constraint can also be obtained
through a source term. one starts with a modiation
term

(133)

and uses this to nd 4. then one again modies the
constraint to nd 6, 8 etc. in this way we can eec-
tively work with the modication term (131).

the integration constant c4;1 and thus the fourth-order
constraint are with this approach modied compared to
(80) with (129) added; also the subleading terms contain
additional terms to those found in the previous section.
this emphasizes the ambiguity of the constraint beyond
lowest order.

3. eective lagrangian

a systematic way of representing subleading terms at
large distances is like in the scalar case obtained by it-
eration of eld equations. it is here convenient to use a
eld a =  log , in terms of which the eld equations
are

where each term on the right-hand side is positive for

with the calculation in this subsection it is clear that
dierent constraints producing a nite action solution
have dierent subleading terms. in fact, it is possible to
remove the subleading terms from 4 if the exponential
of (116) also contains a term

g. the t hooft path integral measure

in the gaussian approximation

for completeness we briey indicate how the t hooft
[2] path integral measure is obtained from our analy-
sis. this subsection mostly contains well-known results.
however, we indicate how our methods can be used to
generalize the result of t hooft.

the value of the classical action up to second order
in the mass parameter when calculated by means of the
constrained instanton solution of sec. iii b leads to the
result

s = 

82
g2 

2222

g2

(137)

in agreement with [2], [5], [7]. beyond second order the
result will contain ambiguities since it depends on the
form of 4 which, as we have seen, can be modied.

the euclidean path integral

z =z [da][d]ese [a,]

(138)

with se[a, ] the euclidean yang-mills-higgs action is
evaluated by the saddle-point method. for this purpose
the previously determined constrained instanton solution
is used by a faddeev-popov trick. we write unity as

1 =z d[a, ] ([a]  c) =z d[a, ](cid:0)[a  a](cid:1)

(139)

where the constrained instanton is denoted ( a, ), and
where the constraint it obeys was used in the last step.
multiplying the path integral by the faddeev-popov

unity one obtains

where [a] was dened in (120), while

z =z [da][d]z d[a, ] ([a]  c) ese[a,] (140)
[a, ] =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

to order 0. it is known from the previous analysis that
the modied action

(141)

(142)

+ 

se[a, ] = se[a, ] +  ,  = 
has a nite solution, so using the -function we write
se = se  c and the path integral is hence
z =z [da][d]z d[a, ](cid:0)[a  a](cid:1) e se [a,]ec.

(143)

new integration variables are introduced through the
substitution

(a, )  ( a + a,  + ).

14

[a + a, ]  [ a, ]

(144)

where terms depending on a have been disregarded in
, and

z = ese [ a, ]z [da][d]z d[ a, ]([a]) 
e( se[ a+a, +] se [ a, ]).

(145)

the path integral (145) is the same as that given by t
hooft [2] in the approximation where the classical action
se[ a, ] is computed up to order 2 and the uctuations
(including the faddeev-popov determinant [a, ]) to
order 0.
in this approximation the integral over  is
identical to what is obtained by means of the standard
method of collective coordinates. this follows from (114),
where the term a0a
in the integrand projects out the
dilatation zero mode. also [ a, ] is easily checked to
be the same as the corresponding expression obtained by
means of collective coordinates. this argument is actu-
ally independent of the detailed form of the constraint,
provided the projection of the derivative of the constraint
with respect to the gauge eld onto the dilatation zero
mode is nonvanishing.



iv. conclusion

our results can be summarized in the following way:
for 4 theory a nite action instanton solution of the
massive theory without any constraint does not exist be-
cause of its large-distance behavior that is characterized
by exponential increase instead of fall o. two types of
constraint are considered. if the constraint is required to
depend only on the scalar eld, the only possible way to
cure this defect is by means of a constraint cubic in the
eld. other constraints only depending on the eld are
ruled out because they lead to singular behavior of the
constrained instanton solution at the origin. the con-
straint can also amount to having a source term in the
eld equation. this type of constraint can be constructed
in such a way that it has the same eect as the constraint
cubic in the eld referred to above.

for the yang-mills-higgs theory the situation is rather
dierent. here we found that exponential fall o at in-
nity can be obtained by adjustment of integration con-
stants without imposition of any constraint. on the
other hand, a constraint is necessary in order to ensure
absence of singularities of the constrained instanton at
small distances that prevent the action from being nite.
the form of the constraint required for this purpose is
uniquely determined to lowest order in the mass vari-
able, and only a special constraint involving eld vari-
ables only can be constructed. on the other hand, a
constraint corresponding to a source term in the yang-
mills eld equation is possible; the explicit form of the
