abstract

a gauge formulation for the proca model quantum theory in an open path functional space

representation is revisited. the path dependent vacuum state is obtained. starting from this one,

other excited states can be obtained too. additionally, the functional integration measure needed

to dene an internal product in the state space is constructed.

in the reference [1] authors have presented the proca gauge theory in a geometric form. they use an

open path representation [1, 2, 3] (p -representation) in wich the general quantum states and operators

depend and act on path functionals, respectively. in this letter, as a contribution to the understanding of

this formulation we discuss the explicit construction of the open path state space for proca gauge theory

as a geometrical extension from standard quantum field theory. the letter is organized as follow. we

present a self contained brief review on proca gauge theory in a geometric representation [1]. then,

the vacuum state is presented and, from its formal normalization the funtional integration measure is

deduced. finally, a recurrence relation for the excited states is given , showing as an example the rst

excited state and its energy.

the brief review begins here. let l be the lagrangian for the proca gauge theory

l = (cid:28)

where the symbol hi means r d3x( ), f = a  a is the maxwell eld and  is an scalar
eld (i.e., stuckelberg scalar). eq. (1) is gauge invariant under the transformations a =  and
 = . subsequently, form diracs quatization, first class primary and secondary constraints arise;
namely 0
a +   0, where the s are the canonical conjugates momenta of proca and

a  0 and k0

scalar elds, respectively. the hamiltonian can then be obtained in the standard way

the quantization of the theory starts with the promotion from elds to operators acting on the

hilbert space physical sector in the p -representation (hp) and the poisson algebra to a commutator

one. the sector hp is dened trough p -functionals prescribing (p.q) = f (p )(q) (here p and q are

open path colections) where

f (p y

x ) = ei(x) exp(cid:18)izp

dtkak(t)(cid:19)ei(y)

(3)

is the gauge invariant wilson path (following the wilson loop idea) operator asociated to the

3-spatial path p y

x , wich starts at x and ends at y.

the operator (3) guarantees that hp contitutes a p -functional set of solutions of the first class
a operator with eigenvalues (z, p )

constraints. at the same time (p ) are eigenfunctions of  and k

and t k(z, p ), respectively. let us recall the end densities

(z, p ) =

n

xa=1

(z, pa)

and (z, pa) = 3(z  ya)  3(z  xa),

and the distributional eld of tangent vectors associated to the paths

t k(z, p ) =

n

xa=1

t k(z, pa)

and t k(z, pa) = zpa

dtk3(t  z).

next, when mandelstam [4] and loop [5] derivatives are taken into account, the hamiltonian (2) can

be rewritten in a geometric form

let us remember that given a p -functional g(p ) the mandelstam derivative can be dened as

where p is an innitesimal open path. on the other hand the loop derivative is

p ii(z)g(p ) = g(p.p )  g(p ),

ijij(z)g(p ) = g(c.p )  g(p ),

where c is an innitesimal loop with area k = 1

2 kijij. this ends the review.

in order to nd the explicit form of the state space one can introduce the vacuum state as follows.

the operator (6) has a cuadratic tangent-dependient interaction part and also end densities dependence.

on the other hand, the kinematic term is a laplacian-like. then, the key to nd the schroedinger

eigenstates consists in carrying out a narrow analogy with the standard quantum mechanic harmonic

oscillator. for this system, the ground state should have a gaussian functional form

demanding s(p ) to be an even p -functional, a more general possible form is

0(p ) = exp (s(p )).

s(p ) = zp

(10)

where the propagator ij(yy ) is an explicit invariant under path translations and satises the following
properties

symetry: ij(x) = ji(x)

and

reality: ij(x) =  

ij(x).

(11)

considering e0 the ground state energy eigenvalue, then the equation h0(p ) = e00(p ) gives the

following relations

and

(13)

where the propagator and energy are formally manipulated. anyway equations (12) y (13) gives the

formal solution for the vacuum state. to obtain this solution we transform to the fourier space, dening

the transformed propagator aij by means of

ij(x) = z

substitution of eq. (14) in (12) leads to

here, the aij(p) have some symetry properties coming from the original propagator; namely aij(p) =
aij(p) and aij(p) = a

ij(p). taking this into account, we choose the ansatz

aij(p) = a(p2)ij + b(p2)pipj,

(16)

where a(p2) and b(p2) are even real functions of momentum p. these functions can be easily obtained if

one substitutes eq. (16) in (15). this gives the following double solutions for a and b

a = 

1

2w(p)

and b = 

a
p2 

w(p)
2m 2p2

(17)

with w(p) = p2 + m 2. however, if we require the gaussian form for the ground state, only the
particular choice a+ and b solutions is allowed. considering this combination, from (13) the vacuum

state energy is obtained

it is noted that the 3

as the klein-gordon dispersion relation too. for this solution, the functional s(p ) yields

(19)

from this , the vacuum state is dened up to a conventional regularization factor (i.e., cut-o, etc).

additionally, eq. (19) throws light on the question of p -functional space integration measure. this

question is fundamental if one wants to dene an internal product in the state space. if we consider the

polarizations vector ()

 (p) ( runs from 1 to 3 and labels the polarization states) whose completeness

relations are

()
 (p)()

 (p) =  +

pp
m 2

(20)

with the minkowski metric signature  = diag(+  ), one can dene a functional on 3-spatial paths
and momentum space points

r()(p, p ) =

where by eq. (19) can be rewritten as

()
i (p)

pw(p) zp

dyi exp (ip  y),

s(p ) =

2 z

d3p
(2)3r()(p, p )r()(p, p ).

(21)

(22)

it is easy to see that r()(p, p ) is proportional to the tangent t k(z, p ) fourier transformed, and that
rst one have complete information on paths in the same way that the tangent have it.

then, we dene the integration measure by means of the symbol

z dr  z dr()dr ()

(2)3

,

and using eqs. (9), (22) and (23) it is veried that the ground state is formally normalized

z dr

0 (p )0(p ) = z dr()dr ()

(2)3

exp (z

d3p
(2)3 r()r ()) = 1.

(23)

(24)

in an identical way with the loop representation for the maxwell field [5], we can observe the

protagonical role played by the polarization vectors in the measure construction.

let us nally show the recurrence relations for excited energy eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian (6).

following the analogy with the quantum mechanical harmonic oscilator we have the general solution

where h(p ) are p -functional polynomials of the form

(p ) = es(p )h(p ),

h(p ) = xs=0zp

dta1

1 z dtas

s a1 as(t1, . . . , ts).

(25)

(26)

these are the functional extension of the hermites polynomials, and we demand the following prop-
erties: a1 as|s=0 = 0 = const. and a1 as(t1, . . . , ts) bounded.
abc(ta, tb, . . . , tc) satisfy the additional symetry property

(26), the propagators

in eq.

a1 aiai+1 as(t1, . . . , ti, ti+1, . . . , ts) = a1 ai+1ai as(t1, . . . , ti+1, ti, . . . , ts).

(27)

in this way , using eqs. (10), (25) and (26) in h(p ) = e(p ) we obtain the desired recurrence

relations for s = 0, 1, 2, . . .

with am an kl|n<m = kl. eq.
relations that generate dierent hermites polynomials, linking the order s + 2 functions with those of

(28) constitute a p -functional generalization of the recurrence

(28)

order s. in this sense, the rst excited state (meson state) in the open path representation depends on

the rst hermites p -functional polynomial, that is to say

1(p ) = 0(p )zp

dtkk(t).

(29)

using the recurrence relations (28) with k(t) bounded, the energy of this state is e1 = e0 + w(p).

equation (29) occurs in an identical way when the creation operator, constructed from the standard

plane wave expansion acts on the vacuum state (i.e., see something similar in a functional formulation

for scalar elds in [6]). however, it would be interesting to explore a posible construction of creation-
anihilation operators in a pure geometrical language considering r() as a canonical variable (which
has the whole information about the paths), and denig some p -functional derivative on this variable

that acts on wave functions. the construction of this particular derivative perhaps needs the denition

of a p -functional dirac delta which compares two arbitrary paths and vanishes if these have no

intersections.
