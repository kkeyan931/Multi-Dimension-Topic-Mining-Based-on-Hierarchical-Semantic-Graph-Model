abstract.

starting from the dirac equation in external electromagnetic and torsion

elds we derive a path integral representation for the corresponding propagator. an eective

action, which appears in the representation, is interpreted as a pseudoclassical action for a

spinning particle. it is just a generalization of berezin-marinov action to the background un-

der consideration. pseudoclassical equations of motion in the nonrelativistic limit reproduce

exactly the classical limit of the pauli quantum mechanics in the same case. quantization

of the action appears to be nontrivial due to an ordering problem, which needs to be solved

to construct operators of rst-class constraints, and to select the physical sector. finally the

quantization reproduces the dirac equation in the given background and, thus, justies the

interpretation of the action.

1 introduction

introducing of torsion is usually regarded as a most natural way to extend the description of

the space-time in general relativity. torsion appears naturally as a compensating eld for

local gauge transformations [1] (see [2, 3] for a review of this approach and further references)

and also in the eective low-energy gravity induced by quantum eects of (super)strings.

the main advantage of theories with torsion is that the spin of matter particles (elds),

along with energy and momentum, becomes the source of gravity. this is the reason why

so much attention has been paid to the interaction between torsion and fermion elds [4,

2, 5, 6, 7]. when investigating the quantum eects together with torsion, the latter may

be considered as a classical background for the quantum matter elds. alternatively we

have to think about the propagating torsion which should be subject of quantization. the

dynamical torsion, despite it produces an interesting phenomenological consequences [10],

meets serious theoretical obstacles [11] which put very high lower bound for the torsion mass.

indeed there remains the possibility to treat torsion as purely background eld (maybe not

elementary) which is, by denition, not an object for the quantization. the formulation of a

renormalizable theory of matter elds in an external gravitational eld with torsion has been

given in [12] and some physical [16] and cosmological [13] applications, has been studied.

important information about the spin torsion interaction provides spinning particle prop-

agation in the torsion eld. there are many works devoted to the problem. for example,

using the results of [12], the pauli equation in external electromagnetic and torsion elds

has been derived in [9] 4, and the corresponding equations of motion for the non-relativistic

particle were obtained. these equations show an unusual behavior of the spinning particle

in an external torsion eld [16]. in [7, 8] actions of a massless spinning particle in an external

torsion eld has been obtained on the basis of supersymmetry considerations.

in the present work, we are going to construct a path integral representation for a prop-

agator of a massive spinning particle in external electromagnetic and torsion elds. to this

end we follow the ideas and technics of the papers [17, 18]. in particular, it was demonstrated

there that a special kind of path integral representations for propagators of relativistic par-

ticles allow one to derive, in a sense, a form for gauge invariant classical (pseudoclassical)

actions for the corresponding particles. in such a way, an action for spinning particles with

anomalous magnetic moments, and also actions for spinning particles in odd- dimensional

4earlier some particular form of the pauli equation has been used in [15]. after [9], pauli equation with

torsion has been derived in ref.s [16].

space-time, have been derived for the rst time [24, 18]. thus, besides the path integral

representation for the dirac propagator, we get here a possibility to construct and to study

a gauge invariant pseudoclassical model for spinning particle in torsion eld. one ought to

mention some relevant to the problem under consideration works [19, 20, 21]. in the rst one

some formal path integral representations for massive spinning particle in the presence of

the torsion eld was derived using so called perturbative approach to path integrals, devel-

oped in [22]. such an approach does not take into account possible boundary conditions for

trajectories of integration, which is the case in the problem under consideration. besides of

that, eective actions in such a representation [19] appeared in a non-symmetric form due to

special gauges selected. in two second articles an index theorem for the dirac operator in the

presence of general gravitational background (including torsion) was studied, in particular a

path integral representation for the index of the dirac operator was derived.

the paper is organized in the following way. in the next section we present some con-

siderations [12], which allow us to justify a form of dirac and klein-gordon equations in

external gravitation eld with torsion. in sect. iii we introduce an equation for the dirac

propagator in electromagnetic and torsion elds. using it, a path integral representation for

the propagator is derived. analyzing this representation, in sect. iv, we propose a pseu-

doclassical action to describe a spinning particle in the above-mentioned background. it is

a generalization of the berezin-marinov action [26, 27] to the background under considera-

tion. in a similar manner a classical action for a scalar particle can be derived. we study

equations of motion and consider the nonrelativistic and classical limits. in sect. v, doing

a quantization of the action, we arrived at the corresponding dirac equation. results of two

latter sect. conrm the interpretation of the pseudoclassical action derived by us from the

path integral representation. in the last sect. vi we draw some conclusions.

2 dirac and klein-gordon equations in an external

gravitational eld with torsion

let us start with the basic notions of gravity with torsion. all our notations correspond to
those of the book [14]. the metric g and torsion t 
 are independent characteristics of
the space-time. when torsion is present, the covariant derivative  is based on the non-
symmetric connection, namely 
 can be expressed

 . the torsion eld t

 s + q ,

where t = t 
tensor q

 satises two conditions q

 = 0 and  q = 0.

  is the vector trace of torsion, s = t

is axial vector and the

the actions of the matter elds in an external gravitational eld with torsion must be

formulated in such a way that they lead to the consistent quantum theory. one can impose

the principles of locality, general covariance and require the symmetries of the given theory

(like gauge invariance for the qed or sm) in at space-time to hold for the theory in curved

space-time with torsion. then the renormalizable eld theory can be achieved through the

introduction of some new non-minimal parameters of the matter-torsion interaction 1,2 and
1,...,5 [12] (see also [14]). for the gut-like gauge theory of interacting elds with spin-0, 1
2

and 1, the full action with all these non-minimal parameters can be written as

s =z d4xg (cid:26)

2 (cid:16)x i pi + m 2(cid:17) 2

v () + i (cid:16) d +x j qj  im + h(cid:17) o + svacuum ,

(2)

where d denotes the derivatives which are covariant with respect to both gravitational and
gauge eld but do not contain torsion. we accept that the vector elds do not couple with

torsion even in a minimal way, in order to maintain the gauge invariance.

interaction of

scalar elds with torsion is purely non-minimal. for one real scalar there are ve possible

non-minimal structures

p1 = r, p2 =  t , p3 = t t , p4 = s s, p5 = q q ,

and the non-minimal parameters 1, .., 5. a more complicated scalar content may require

additional non-minimal terms [12]. for the dirac spinors there are two possible non-minimal

structures

q1 = i5  s,

q2 = i t

and two non-minimal parameters 1, 2. the action of the minimal theory for the dirac
spinor eld, is given by the spinor part of the expression (gut) with 1 = 1/8 and 2 = 0
[2, 14].

among all the non-minimal parameters, the ones related to the s-eld are most essential

for the renormalizability, which can be achieved by including 1 and 4 and 1-type structures

4

into the classical action [12]. it is remarkable that not only spinors but also scalars have to

interact with torsion if we want to have a renormalizable theory. other parameters 2, 2,3,5

are purely non-minimal. for this reason in the rest of this paper we will consider the torsion

as purely antisymmetric and describe it by the axial vector s. it is worth to mention that

the string-induced torsion is completely antisymmetric as well.

since torsion is metric-independent quantity, one can study the theory with torsion and

the at minkowski metric. on the other hand, since we are going to consider torsion as

purely background eld, it can be always normalized in such a way that the non-minimal

parameter 1 is set to unity. therefore, the dirac equation in external electromagnetic and

torsion elds can be presented in the form:

h  (cid:16) p  i5s(cid:17)  mi (x) = 0 ,

(3)

where p = i  qa(x).

the klein-gordon equation in external electromagnetic and torsion elds has the form

h p 2 + m2 + 4 s2i (x) = 0 ,

(4)

with an arbitrary non-minimal parameter 4.

3 path integral representations for the propagators

in this section we are going to write down path integral representations for the propaga-

tors of spinning and spinless particles in the background under consideration, following the

techniques of refs. [17, 18]. in this relation one ought to mention the works [23] where the

propagators were presented as path integrals over bosonic and fermionic variables.

first we start with the case of a spinning particle and consider the causal green function

c(x, y) of the equation (3), which is the propagator of the corresponding particle,

h  (cid:16) p  i5s(cid:17)  mi c(x, y) = 4(x  y) .

(5)

to get the result in supersymmetric form one needs to work with the transformed function

c(x, y) = c(x, y)5, which obeys the equation

h  (cid:16) p  i4s(cid:17)  m4i c(x, y) = 4(x  y),

(6)

5

where the set of ve matrices n, n = 0, 1, .., 4, forms a representation of the cliord algebra

in 5- dimensions,

 = 5, 4 = 5,  = 0, 1, 2, 3 ,

[n, m]+ = 2 nm ,

nm = diag(1,1,1,1,1) .
(x, y) as a matrix element of an operator c

,

(7)

similar to schwinger [28] we present c

however, in contrast with the cited work, we do this in the coordinate space only,

c
(x, y) = hx| c

|yi .

(8)

in (8) spinor indices are written for clarity explicitly and will be omitted hereafter; |xi are
eigenvectors for some hermitian operators of coordinates x , the corresponding canonically

conjugated operators of momenta are p, so that:

hx|yi = 4(x  y) ,
p|pi = p|pi ,

z |xihx|dx = i ,
hp|pi = 4(p  p) ,

hx|p|yi = i4(x  y) ,

hx|pi =

1
(2)2 eipx ,

x |xi = x|xi ,
[p, x ] = i
 ,
z |pihp|dp = i ,
[, ] = iqf (x) ,

 = p  qa(x) , f(x) = a  a .

the equation (6) implies the formal solution for the operator c:

c = bf 1 ,

bf =   m4  i4s .

the operator bf may be written in an equivalent form,

bf =   m4 

i
6

using the following formula

s ,

(9)

  ,

0123 = 1 .

that allows one to regard it as a fermi operator, if one reckons -matrices as fermi

operators. in general case an inverse operator to a fermi operator bf can be presented by

means of an integral over a super-proper time (, ) of an exponential with an even exponent

where  is an even and  is an odd (grassmann) variable, the latter anticommutes with bf

then, the green function c(xout, xin) takes the form:

c(xout, xin) =z

dz hxout|ei h(,)|xinid .

now we are going to represent the matrix element entering in the expression (12) by

means of a path integral following a technique of refs.

[17, 18]. first we write, as usual,

ei h = (cid:16)ei h/n(cid:17)n

all the operators ei h/n . besides, we introduce n additional integrations over  and 

and then insert (n  1) resolutions of identity r |xihx|dx = i between

to transform then the ordinary integrals over these variables into the corresponding path-

integrals:

c(xout, xin) = lim

d 0z nyk=1hxk|ei h(k,k)|xk1i

(k  k1) (k  k1) d0 dx1 ... dxn 1d 1...d n d 1...d n ,

(13)

where  = 1/n, x0 = xin, xn = xout. bearing in mind the limiting process, we can, as

usual, restrict ourselves to calculate the matrix elements from (13) approximately,

hxk|ei h(k,k)|xk1i  hxk|1i h(k, k)|xk1i .

(14)

in this connection it is important to notice that the operator h(k, k), by construction, is
symmetric with respect to the operators x and p . thus, one can write

h(, ) = sym(x,p ) h(, , x, p ),

7

where h(, , x, p) is the weyl symbol of the operator h(, ) in the sector of x, p,

h(, , x, p) = (cid:18)m2 + s2  p 2 +
s 0123(cid:17)  (cid:18)p  m4 i

f  k
s(cid:19) ,

and

p = p  qa(x) ,

k = p s .

(15)

(16)

the matrix elements (14) are expressed in terms of the weyl symbols at the middle point

xk = (xk + xk1)/2, see [29]. taking all that into account, one realizes that in the limiting

process the matrix elements (14) can be replaced by the expressions

(2)4 exp i(cid:20)pk
z d pk

xk  xk1



 h(k, k, xk, pk)(cid:21)  .

(17)

such expressions with dierent values of k do not commute due to the -matrix structure

and, therefore, are to be situated in (13) in such a way that the numbers k increase from

the right to the left. for the two -functions, accompanying each matrix element (14) in the

expression (13), we use the integral representations

(k  k1)(k  k1) =

i

2z ei[k(kk1)+k(kk1)]d kd k ,

where k are odd variables. then we attribute formally to the -matrices, entering into

(17), also an index k, and at the same time we attribute to all quantities the time k
according the index k they have, k = k , so that   [0, 1]. introducing the t-product,
which acts on - matrices, it is possible to gather all the expressions, entering in (13), in one

exponent and deal then with the - matrices like with odd variables. at equal times the -

matrices anticommute due to their contractions to complete antisymmetric objects. taking

into account all that, we get for the right side of (13):

where x( ), p( ), ( ), ( ), are even and ( ), ( ) are odd trajectories, obeying the

boundary conditions x(0) = xin, x(1) = xout, (0) = 0, (0) = 0. the operation of

t-ordering acts on the -matrices which are supposed formally to depend on time  . the

and

the discussion of the role of the measure (22) can be found in [17].

let us now pass to the case of a spinless particle. here we need to consider a corresponding

propagator dc which obeys the non-homogeneous klein-gordon equation (see (4)

hp 2 + m2 + 4 s2i dc(x, y) = 4(x  y) .

(23)

its path integral representation may be obtained from one (21) for the spinning particle if

one drops there all odd variables and remember that in this case the torsion eld s can not
be anymore normalized to set the parameter 4 to unity, and s2 has to be multiplied by this

parameter. thus, we get

dc(xout, xin) = i

4 pseudoclassical action for the spinning particle and

classical equations of motion in the nonrelativistic

limit

the exponent in the integrand (21) can be considered as an eective and non-degenerate

lagrangian action of a spinning particle in electromagnetic and torsion elds. it consists of

two principal parts. the rst one, which unies two summands with the derivatives of e and

, can be treated as a gauge xing term sgf,

sgf =z 1

0

( e +  ) d ,

10

and corresponds, in fact, to gauge conditions e =  = 0. the rest part of the eective

action can be treated as a gauge invariant action of a spinning particle in the eld under

consideration. it has the form

(25)

where

z = x + i, m 2 = m2 + s2  16 s 0123, d = 2is .

the action (25) is a generalization of berezin-marinov action [26, 27] to the background

with torsion. one can easily verify that it is reparametrization invariant. explicit form of

supersymmetry transformations, which generalize ones for the berezin-marinov action, is not

so easily to derive. their presence will be proved in an indirect way. namely we are going

to prove the existence of two primary rst-class constraints in hamiltonian formulation.

let us analyze the equations of motion for theory with the action (25).

one can choose (it is also may be seen from the hamiltonian analysis which follows) the

gauge conditions  = 0 and e = 1/m to simplify the analysis of the equations (28-30). in

order to perform the nonrelativistic limit we dene the three dimensional spin vector ~ as

ponents of the stress tensor:

f0i = ei = 0ai  ia0

and

fij = ijk h k .

substituting these formulas into (30) and (29), disregarding the terms of higher orders in

the external elds, we arrive at the equations:

they coincide perfectly with the classical equations of motion obtained in the work [9] from

the pauli equation in the same background. that conrms our interpretation of the action

(26). additional arguments in favor of the interpretation will be obtained in the next section,

where we are going to quantize of the action.

a corresponding classical gauge invariant action for spinless particle, which may be ex-

tracted from (24), has the form

we can see that it exhibits interaction between the particle and torsion. the dependence on

the background torsion enters the equations of motion of the particle (in a very nontrivial

way for the coordinate-dependent torsion) and therefore the presence of a torsion may be

detected not only for the spinor, but also for scalar particles.

and the same conditions for the constraints (1)

thus, the hamiltonian h appears to be proportional to constraints, as one can expect in

the case of a reparametrization invariant theory,

h = i(2)

no more secondary constraints arise from the dirac procedure, and the lagrange multipliers

1 and 2 remain undetermined, in perfect correspondence with the fact that the number of

gauge transformations parameters equals two for the theory in question. one can go over

from the initial set of constraints (cid:16)(1), (2)(cid:17) to the equivalent one (cid:16)(1), t(cid:17) , where:

t = (2) +

(2)

(1)

3n .

(40)

the new set of constraints can be explicitly divided in a set of the rst-class constraints,

which is (cid:16)(1)

1,2, t(cid:17) and in a set of the second-class constraints, which is (1)

3n .

now we consider an operator quantization, expecting to get in this procedure the dirac

equation (5). to this end we perform only a partial gauge xing, by imposing the supple-

mentary gauge conditions g

1,2 = 0 to the primary rst-class constraints (1)
1,2 ,

g

1 =  = 0, g

2 = e = 1/m ,

(41)

which coincide with those we used in the lagrangian analysis. one can check that the

conditions of the conservation in time of the supplementary constraints (41) give equations for

13

determination of the multipliers 1 and 2. thus, on this stage we reduced our hamiltonian

theory to one with the rst-class constraints t and second-class ones  =(cid:16)(1), g(cid:17). after

that we will use the so called dirac method for systems with rst-class constraints [31],

which, being generalized to the presence of second-class constraints, can be formulated as

follow: the commutation relations between operators are calculated according to the dirac

brackets with respect to the second-class constraints only; second-class constraints operators

equal zero; rst-class constraints as operators are not zero, but, are considered in sense of

restrictions on state vectors. all the operator equations have to be realized in some hilbert

space.

the sub-set of the second-class constraints(cid:16)(1)

1,2, g(cid:17) has a special form [32], so that one

can use it for eliminating of the variables e, pe, , p, from the consideration, then, for the
rest of the variables x, p, n, the dirac brackets with respect to the constraints  reduce to
ones with respect to the constraints (1)

3n only and can be easy calculated,

{x, p}d((1)

3n ) = 
 ,

{n, m}d((1)

3n ) =

i
2

nm ,

while others dirac brackets vanish. thus, the commutation relations for the operators
x, p, n, which correspond to the variables x, p, n respectively, are

[x, p] = i{x, p}d((1)
h m, ni+
= i{m, n}d((1)

3n ) = 
 ,
1
3n ) = 
2

mn.

besides, the operator equations hold:

(1)

3n = pn + i n = 0.

(42)

(43)

the commutation relations (42) and the equations (43) can be realized in a space of four

columns (x) dependent on x. at the same time we select x to be operators of multipli-
cation, and p = i,  = i
2 5, where n are the -matrices (, 5).
the rst-class constraints t as operators have to annihilate physical vectors; in virtue of

25, and 4 = i

(43), (40) these conditions reduce to the equations:

(2)

1,2(x) = 0,

(44)

where (2)
guity in the construction of the operator (2)

1,2 are operators, which correspond to the constraints (38), (39). there is no ambi-
from

1 , according to the classical function (2)

1

(38). thus, taking into account the realizations of the commutation relations (42), one easily

14

can see that the rst equation (44) reproduces the dirac equation (5). as to the construc-
tion of the operator (2)
an ordering problem since the constraint (2)
2

2 , according to the classical function (2)

contains terms with products of the momenta

from (39), we meet here

2

and functions of the coordinates. for such terms we choose the symmetrized (weyl) form

of the corresponding operators, which, in particular, provides the hermicity of the operator
(2)

2 . but the main reason is, that such a correspondence rule provides the consistency of

the two equations (44). indeed, in this case we have

(2)

2 =(cid:16) (2)
1 (cid:17)2

,

(45)

and the second equation (44) appears to be merely the consequence of the rst equation (44),

i.e. of the dirac equation (5). thus, we see that the operator quantization of the action

reproduces the dirac quantum theory of spinning particle in electromagnetic and torsion

eld.

6 conclusions

we have constructed a path integral representations for propagators of spinning and spinless

particles in the torsion and electromagnetic elds. these representations allow one to study

and calculate the propagators in the same manner as it was done, for example, in [33]. from

the path integral representations we extract (pseudo)classical actions for the particles in an

external torsion and electromagnetic elds. these actions satisfy some natural conditions:

they are consistent with the renormalizable theory of interacting elds on torsion background,

they manifest standard gauge symmetries, and the low-energy limit ts nicely with the

expressions obtained from the pauli equation. upon quantization, a quantum mechanics of

particles is produced again. in our opinion all that justies the form of the actions. as a

somehow unexpected consequence one meets the nontrivial interaction with torsion for the

scalar particle. this interaction has a non-minimal form and results from the one between

scalar led and background torsion.

some speculations may be done in relation to cosmology problems. according to [11], the

mass of the propagating torsion axial vector s has to be very large: at least some orders of

magnitude above the fermi scale. therefore torsion can not be visible in the modern uni-

verse. however, this opens the door to consider the string-induced torsion as an origin for

the cosmological perturbations during the inationary phase. after the early stage of ina-

tion torsion becomes non-propagating due to its mass, in this respect it is dierent from the

15

magnetic eld. there are some indications that the torsion - induced density perturbations

dier from the ones induced by quantum eects of the metric [34]. the dierence between

torsion and magnetic elds in the particle actions (25), (34) may indicate that the torsion

can produce perturbation spectrum distinct from the one of external magnetic eld [35].

the expressions for the particle actions obtained here can be an appropriate basis for the

formulation of the cosmological source terms in an external torsion eld. these application

of our results will be explored elsewhere.
